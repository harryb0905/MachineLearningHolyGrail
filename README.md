# Machine Learning Holy Grail

This repository contains code for machine learning related things.

* [/NLP](NLP): Code relevant to Natural Language Processing, including useful Jupyter Notebooks which summarise SCC.413 Applied Data Mining labs covered during my MSc Data Science degree
* [/data-mining](data-mining): My solutions to the SCC.403 Data Mining labs covered during my MSc Data Science degree
* [/handson-ml2-algorithms](handson-ml2-algorithms): Contains code snippets and OOP implementations of ML algorithms from the Hands-On ML with Scikit-learn, Keras and Tensorflow book
* [/handson-ml2-master](handson-ml2-master): A clone of the GitHub repo Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurélien Géron, including my solutions where appropriate
* [/ml-api](ml-api): A set of functions to expose Machine Learning and Data Science tools (soon to be a Flask API) 
* [/projects](projects): Data Science projects I have worked on (with most datasets taken from Kaggle)
* [/resources](resources): Useful resources for Data Science/Machine Learning/AI
