@adlynch i missed out on that!
And soon the BEST (for me) part of the election is about to start... The all night TV coverage. @BBCNews and @SkyNews open on every device!
@AmazingPhil LOVE that photo
@jamestbl that would have been such a petrifying moment in her life
@SkyNews your report into Lubitz talks of 'commiting' suicide. This is an outdated term. For guidance read point 6: http://t.co/IGya7PvW0n
@jamestbl it's not the act of saying it it's the act of accepting yourself surely
The shows are becoming more emotional with each one!! 3 left, confidence, a final open Surgery and a coming out special to end! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Tonight on The Surgery #MindMatters we're here to help with things that are bothering you. 9pm, my last show with @DrAaronB üòì

@ItsGiselleJay is before possible? Radha and I tend to leg it after the show. 8pm?

Watching all 6 @starwars films. Wow forgot how painful The Phantom Menace was.

Random day today:  nearly-dead person on tube,  cameo in W1A,  bumping into @GethincJones in the BBC lift now off for brunch with @dev_101
@MJRgrs ... Not a word
@MJRgrs stole the scene
Oh good! This guy stretched out in the most awkward position eyes slightly open on the tube in front of me just moved. #NotDead #Phew
@daviequirk ha! Love it
Seeing an avalanche form right before your eyes is absolutely terrifying http://t.co/d2fRpxh8LX

@MJRgrs :)
@MJRgrs perv
@MJRgrs stop
@astevo99 it's down to the individual what offends them. To some gay people it's offensive
@astevo99 being stopped when you're straight just means stop kissing. Stopped when you're gay means 'stop being gay'. It means more
@ItsGiselleJay thank you
Tonight we're talking about divorce on tonight's Surgery. If you, a friend or your parents are going through it we're here 2 help #R1Divorce

Morning everyone! x
Just spoke on air about our Surgery show, Wednesday at 9pm. Do you feel comfortable with your gender? #R1Gender
@Dansdoublechin aww!
@richbrown she's wrong
@ArticulatePanda apparently not. Sparked by 'you made me feel shit'. Apparently not possible!
Starting the Saturday evening with the fun heated debate with the other half 'can someone make you 'feel' something?' #party

@rickedwards1 @jameelajamil yeah congratulations Rick. We were watching it in the office - some very good points!
@Dracko_Aida really though?
@Grave_Nigger lol
In a dilemma - just realised we've put a male skewing Surgery show up against the final of the World Cup. Hmmm
@sazzy69 no, should I?
@sazzy69 never heard of that
@Lambo1985 yes
Tonight on The Surgery we're talking about the use of steroids while working out. Are they harmful?
My 3 year old nephew disturbed his parents at 4am saying 'someone said peek-a-boo!' to him. He then pointed to his wall and said 'ghost' !!
@betabetic I remember the chocolate - in date - with all the maggots *vom*
@betabetic what!? When did that ever happen!?
3 weeks today @bbcr1 is in Ibiza! #SeriousGymMotivation
#1XtraPowerList is being revealed now on @1Xtra
@machine_kicker oh. That's @ProducerAd we get that a lot
@machine_kicker no. Why?
@YasminEvans @TwinB @1Xtra i don't think I've ever been in a more stressful environment than the panel list this morning!
@TheBiancaDelRio Good morning Bianca - welcome to the UK, I've emailed your people but no response, would you mind giving them a push?
@Shukezz done
First football last night today now working with @TwinB and @YasminEvans on @1Xtra 's #1XtraPowerList today - all new experiences!
Ouch. It's a World Record
@JayForster it depends which part we're comparing!
My first World Cup football match and this is actually embarrassing!
@Dougle666 looking good!
Morning!
@OhHeyJacob and you work for Samsung!
@Rich_iz I thought we had tickets to @TheBiancaDelRio - we don't :( gutted!

No wait, found room for the all-you-can-eat desert buffet http://t.co/SnH2jVo5yE
Sat in a hotel at an all-you-can-eat buffet dinner.   Can't move. Literally.   My stomach hurts. Hoping it goes down soon! #WhyDoIDoIt?
@KirsteenV aww thank you! Have a good time x
@tallwoman oh yes! I'd forgotten about that
I get that factor 20 suncream means x20 time before you burn. What good does reapplying do then? Surely it's still the original x20?
@oh_bradley a week

Tonight's Surgery @DrRadhaModgil and myself are talking about #CrohnsDisease if you need help or have Qs @BBCR1 from 9pm
@forcrohns thank you. We're aiming to do it right tonight
Avoid Westfield West London. An incident means whole place closed. It's Hell on earth - thousands of people barely moving.
Have a great Pride day to everyone out celebrating today xx üë¨üë≠‚ù§Ô∏èüåà
@Yuddylicious Happily Emile took her out for a walk to let me sleep :)

Ooh Google Glass is available in the UK. If anyone wants to buy me a pair you'll have a friend for life!
Taking my sister and niece to @WickedUK we're SO EXCITED!
@giles_harriet @LydiaHoney1 awww!
@katierselliott Oh that's terrible! I'm so sorry, what specifically?
Tonight's Surgery we're talking about unhealthy relationships with @StaceyDooley1 @NikkiSanderson @DrRadhaModgil 03700100100 if you need us
There's a special guest sitting in on The Surgery tonight! My 6 year old niece Elan :) http://t.co/ekzZeUNC6d
The competition's been won! Here's the answer: https://t.co/p2XBSAAHHB
@JAMESINREHAB someone hasn't upgraded their phone!
What a gorgeous day! Drive to work in Central London was a joy!!
Can someone PLEASE guess the right answer on the @BBCR1 competition. I want to go home to bed!

I've been working on Seize Summer competition. If you want to win a pair of tickets to @GlastoFest Tunein to @dev_101 on @BBCR1 Sat at 8am
@BooellisJames James, are you just sending me a stream of consciousness.
An old man just sneezed on me on the tube. Actual snot.   I feel violated
@TheBiancaDelRio looking forward to seeing you in London!
@Dougle666 slowly does it - had my first brief jog today. Waiting anxiously for tomorrow to find out if it hurts! :)
@Dougle666 it's a myth!
@stuartdgray I did half way through the gig. Got very excited
@gabicox12 we are! Either this week or next
I've got to be honest @officialR5 were very good!

@GeraldsTweeting *belatedly* hi
Think 'Xbox On' problems are very funny - but a warning sign for Siri, Ok Glass and Google Now! On air: 'Siri, text hi to 81199'
@ThisisDavina oh no - you've got me going now too!
This opening ceremony is on the boring side! #WorldCup
@harryfo see you there
@Chris_Stark me too! Cinemas and shopping centres are empty!
Love working at the @bbc bumped into @Schafernaker who gave me a personalised weather report (sunny off-and-on for a fortnight!)
@richmoney70 thank you Richard
@zort70 true
@richmoney70 hello! The series was amazing. This episode, for me, not so much
Well that was disappointing #GoT
@DynamoTightstar oh no! Why?
Seeing as tonight's #GameOfThrones is ep 9 of the series are we set for a good one?
Depressing fact to go to bed on http://t.co/1R9xbP0qcf
@criesnovelli yes please
Thank you to everyone who took part in tonight's Surgery! Amazingly diverse range of calls and texts! You kept @DrRadhaModgil on her toes!!
I'm going to miss talking to @danisnotonfire and @AmazingPhil !

Ah! So nice to be back in the @bbcr1 studio again! Let's do another Surgery. 03700100100 or 81199 on the text if you need us x
@Sonos do you recommend the full 5.1 then for the living room? Or will the soundbar do?
@James_Saye good idea. Thanks James
Opinions please: Surround speakers in the living room or soundbar? #TechOpinion
@PrincessNardz nice!
@PrincessNardz what's with the hashtag?
Morning! x
Morning! On a video editing course today. Apparently it's radio with pictures!
@BritishGasHelp sadly not :( our salesperson isn't answering his phone or replying to my texts. Shall I DM you?
Another day another flat trauma. @virginmedia pulled it out of the bag &amp; @BritishGas have messed up with wrong size radiators! #flatIssues
@CJHardman we've got to update your phone!!

@BriBry0reilly x
@r_stubberfield yay!
Tonight's Surgery with me &amp; @DrRadhaModgil we're focusing on self harm and why people do it. If this is of interest to you, @BBCR1 at 9pm!
@virginmedia I've sent it
@virginmedia is it still worth sending it in? (that is, is it the same person today as yesterday? )
So that's 5 hours waiting for @virginmedia and no show... Doing up the flat this week is going to be a long one!
@AdPaylor yay! Thank you Adam. And thank you for the sweets! It got us through the final hours!!
We did it! We're on air! #AccessAllAreas Studio! @BBCR1 @1Xtra
@MagicalPeasant sure
Finished editing! For the radio geeks: we're bouncing it down. On air in 16 minutes! Phew! #AccessAllAreas Studio
1 hour till #AccessAllAreas Studio is on @BBCR1 @1Xtra and this is my view... It's fine. It's fine... http://t.co/U52udDK3WC
&gt;2 hours and still mixing. Now officially behind schedule and stress is kicking in! Good news though everyone's included! #AccessAllAreas
3 hours to go and we're placing the beds and music down on the #AccessAllAreas Studio show for @BBCR1 and @1Xtra
Under 5 hours to go and @AntDanbury and I are still rough editing the show. Argh! #AccessAllAreas Studio.
11 hours and counting... #AccessAllAreas Studio show on @BBCR1 @1Xtra
The #AccessAllAreas Studio is now closed!!! Woo-hoo! Now I've got just over 24hours to edit 39 hours of content into an hour show!!!
Final day of #AccessAllAreas Studio!
@AdPaylor it'll feel like we're missing someone over the next couple of days! Thanks for all your help! You've been amazing.
@AdamColeberd sorry Adam! I've now been corrected
A very special #R1Surgery tonight we need YOU! Not only your problems but as it's #AccessAllAreas your advice too! 81199 on the text @BBCR1
