@betabetic amazing! But that's me now though right!? ;)
Hey everyone. Any good new apps you'd recommend? I'm looking for some new ones
Love @taylorswift13 new video but is that it? Or is it a two parter?
@DeanDobbs I agree it's going a little slowly. Surely it's about to speed up?
@mwmcdowell fact
@biggaysteve it is an interesting read!
We're talking #confidence on Surgery at 9pm on @BBCR1 with @DrRadhaModgil @JackHoward @DeanDobbs
Something tells me this email from @expedia was sent by a bot rather than a human: http://t.co/SdeJ2ky4qi
Talking families on @BBCRadioCymru with @gutorhun at 7 for @llondceg . Mum, Dad, Sis - I wouldn't listen...
Me and Elan as Minions http://t.co/OxznTWWzhv
Putting final touches to the first ever @officialcharts on both @BBCR1 with @claraamfo at 4pm and @CBBCTV with @celspellman at 6:30pm
Life is good ☺️   (I have nothing else to share other than being sat on the tube feeling that!)
Can Broadcasting House keep the graphics on the side of the wall? Love it. Innuendo Bingo?
My place of work has never looked so cool!
@adlynch i missed out on that!
And soon the BEST (for me) part of the election is about to start... The all night TV coverage. @BBCNews and @SkyNews open on every device!
@AmazingPhil LOVE that photo
@jamestbl that would have been such a petrifying moment in her life
@SkyNews your report into Lubitz talks of 'commiting' suicide. This is an outdated term. For guidance read point 6: http://t.co/IGya7PvW0n
@jamestbl it's not the act of saying it it's the act of accepting yourself surely
The shows are becoming more emotional with each one!! 3 left, confidence, a final open Surgery and a coming out special to end! ❤️
Tonight on The Surgery #MindMatters we're here to help with things that are bothering you. 9pm, my last show with @DrAaronB 😓
You can catch @llondceg on @s4C now!
@YasminEvans you're gorgeous x
@ItsGiselleJay is before possible? Radha and I tend to leg it after the show. 8pm?
... Also don't know how this is possible but it's like the score is too loud on The Phantom Menace - I can't hear a lot of the dialogue
Watching all 6 @starwars films. Wow forgot how painful The Phantom Menace was.
@MJRgrs what a coincidence that's JUST happened to me too. On the tube and the lady next to me certainly didn't spray the air 1st &amp; walk in
Who's Batman? #Elan http://t.co/J1Qxn2Af8w

We're talking bullying on The Surgery on @BBCR1 right now. Text 81199 if you need help or call 03700100100
Tonight we're talking #bullying on The Surgery. If you're being bullied, or you take things out on others listen tonight at 9 @BBCR1
Is thinking someone's fit on the tube okay when they look like your other half?
@adlynch @Moshi_DJ she's miserable but healing thank you. Took her cone off for breakfast and it was like Christmas!!

@GregUpdates it's more fair than needing to be near a London park! :)
@BrittanyMDuffy_ 50,000 tickets went in 40 mins. Each time the lines open we need 1 caller. It's going to be very busy!
@matthew2529 that is definitely true! I wanted to give more tickets away and thought bigger comps would be exhausting. This is quick n easy!
@matthew2529 why is it too easy? You don't want people getting tickets?
I love a good competition me @BBCR1 #BigWeekend 🎵🎧
@JuliaTaylor21 have to go to work, I'm sorry :(

@adlynch it's down to how I want to play it. At the moment yes. I want to understand the shows.
In case anyone's interested in the 'How do you listen to radio' results from earlier - 33% car fm, 8% @BBCiPlayerRadio - why not more?
@Lukestephenson5 yes but it's not my own http://t.co/iaxkoZeP6w
@lozjam mine too :)
Since when was it alright to put cameras in changing rooms? Watching the rugby and if you think about it - it's pretty wrong! #NotAtMyGym
@harryfo sure

Friday 13th!! Oh my god. 👞👞 is this a sign? Will this come in threes today?
... Do shoe fairies exist? Maybe we've got more community helpful burglar in my part of London who break in and make things nicer?
Someone's re-laced my shoes! Tightly, neatly all the way to the top. Who'd do that? Emile says not him, Moshi looked innocent. 👞👞 ??

@MissJenGrieves ❤️ her
What an incredible programme @BBCTwo 'Inside The Commons' is. I highly recommend watching it.
@kazkininmonth Karen!? What happened?
Random day today:  nearly-dead person on tube,  cameo in W1A,  bumping into @GethincJones in the BBC lift now off for brunch with @dev_101
@MJRgrs ... Not a word
@MJRgrs stole the scene
Oh good! This guy stretched out in the most awkward position eyes slightly open on the tube in front of me just moved. #NotDead #Phew
@daviequirk ha! Love it
Seeing an avalanche form right before your eyes is absolutely terrifying http://t.co/d2fRpxh8LX
@Gummybear1981 good point
As lovely as Katie P is what does it say about UK public voting a winner that BB Producers struggle to make a best bits package for! #CBB
Just had first cross dept meeting for this year's @BBCR1 Big Weekend in Norwich! It's gonna v cool!!
@KaHoJakeLeung1 Happy Birthday! x
To support @MindCharity #TimeToTalk Day last night's Surgery was about reaching out when things look bleakest http://t.co/4KJp1ISou0
@patrickbound not a chance! :)
@kathyfraser10 no! None!
Do you feel unable to talk to friends and family? On The Surgery we're talking about importance of reaching out &amp; ways to do so. #R1ReachOut

Heavy snow in London! Yay! ❄️⛄️
How exciting to be a cameo on @danisnotonfire and @AmazingPhil - I promise to be a silent Editor sitting in the corner in future!
@adlynch today is Day 1!
@ChrisMoyles we'd NEVER do that would we! 🚚🚚🚚
Are you a young creative person who loves music, radio &amp; all things digital? Thought of being a @BBCR1 @1Xtra Intern? http://t.co/jAq0kpNqkJ
@stephenfairc thank you :)
@richardm001 technically it's a BBC grade higher. Takes on more responsibilities (broadly v similar though)
@JulieSheps wow ok...
@JulieSheps what a fantastic dream! Was it a good pressie?
@bon_the_one agreed
Exciting new chapter for me. Today I start my new job as Editor of weekends at Radio 1. If u have any feedback of R1 weekends I'm your man!
@ojones205 no far. I'm going to be the Editor for Radio 1's weekend shows
@Aimee_Jay thank you. Apparently it's a trapped nerve :(
@Yuddylicious Editor! Du-du-duuuh!
My last weekend of radio producing for a while 😔 looking forward to a fun last two shows with @Alicelevine today/tomorrow at 1
Morning! Woken up to a locked back. Taken me 25 mins to stand up. I shouldn't be getting this at my age! 😡 #NotTheBestStartToAFriday
@MJRgrs :)
@MJRgrs perv
@MJRgrs stop
@astevo99 it's down to the individual what offends them. To some gay people it's offensive
@astevo99 being stopped when you're straight just means stop kissing. Stopped when you're gay means 'stop being gay'. It means more
@ItsGiselleJay thank you
Tonight we're talking about divorce on tonight's Surgery. If you, a friend or your parents are going through it we're here 2 help #R1Divorce
@ItsGiselleJay I can't do this year sadly :(

Tonight's Surgery is about gender identity, gender dysphoria and being comfortable with who you are. @BBCR1 at 9pm #R1Gender
Already I know there aren't enough hours in today to get everything done! ⏰#Meetings #Producer #EastEnders #Surgery #PackForHols
I'm pretty sure I just offended a non-pregnant lady on the tube. #cringe
@MAA_Charity ah thank you! You too
Morning everyone! x
Just spoke on air about our Surgery show, Wednesday at 9pm. Do you feel comfortable with your gender? #R1Gender
@Dansdoublechin aww!
@richbrown she's wrong
@ArticulatePanda apparently not. Sparked by 'you made me feel shit'. Apparently not possible!
Starting the Saturday evening with the fun heated debate with the other half 'can someone make you 'feel' something?' #party
@adlynch mini @Moshi_DJ !
@FriendSnaps how did the test go?
@OhHeyJacob Most people would believe it IS binary
@OhHeyJacob in what way?
FTM - Are you gonna get a willy?: http://t.co/KqrCYMaMp7 #R1Gender

Got the @Parrot AR Drone to work. But I don't think I'm the best pilot... #CrashAndBurn http://t.co/1YIxRTcMaT
@ArticulatePanda @Parrot no that's the thing. I have that one and it no longer works for me. Just crashes
Anyone know what app works to operate and see the camera on the @Parrot AR Drone 2.0?
@LizzieWilson94 Editor!
@MJRgrs lol ouch
I think it's bad when some shops don't offer refunds for rejected Christmas presents! *cough* @superdry *cough*

@JAMESINREHAB @AttitudeMag damn I should have grabbed an invite!!
@LegsOfLondon TOTALLY up for a night out. My birthday soon...

Out on a school night! @TheBiancaDelRio WILL be worth it though
First freshers DJ gig in place! It's the ever-brilliant Cardiff Uni! Can't wait! #Freshers
@OkLeaah that's the sweetest thing! Thank you (but oh so incorrect!) 😊
This is a test... #GetMeToHull #WonderWhatThisCouldBeAbout @ Broadcasting House http://t.co/K2lMUpu8CH

@ofmiceandkel will the fandom come with the show to Wednesday night from September?
@rickedwards1 @jameelajamil yeah congratulations Rick. We were watching it in the office - some very good points!
@Dracko_Aida really though?
@Grave_Nigger lol
In a dilemma - just realised we've put a male skewing Surgery show up against the final of the World Cup. Hmmm
@sazzy69 no, should I?
@sazzy69 never heard of that
@Lambo1985 yes
Tonight on The Surgery we're talking about the use of steroids while working out. Are they harmful?
My 3 year old nephew disturbed his parents at 4am saying 'someone said peek-a-boo!' to him. He then pointed to his wall and said 'ghost' !!
@betabetic I remember the chocolate - in date - with all the maggots *vom*
@betabetic what!? When did that ever happen!?
3 weeks today @bbcr1 is in Ibiza! #SeriousGymMotivation
#1XtraPowerList is being revealed now on @1Xtra
@machine_kicker oh. That's @ProducerAd we get that a lot
@machine_kicker no. Why?
@YasminEvans @TwinB @1Xtra i don't think I've ever been in a more stressful environment than the panel list this morning!
@TheBiancaDelRio Good morning Bianca - welcome to the UK, I've emailed your people but no response, would you mind giving them a push?
@Shukezz done
First football last night today now working with @TwinB and @YasminEvans on @1Xtra 's #1XtraPowerList today - all new experiences!
Ouch. It's a World Record
@JayForster it depends which part we're comparing!
My first World Cup football match and this is actually embarrassing!
@Dougle666 looking good!
Morning!
@OhHeyJacob and you work for Samsung!
@Rich_iz I thought we had tickets to @TheBiancaDelRio - we don't :( gutted!
Lines open now for The Surgery on @BBCR1 - call with anything that's upsetting you - we're also talking about alcohol dependency 03700100100

No wait, found room for the all-you-can-eat desert buffet http://t.co/SnH2jVo5yE
Sat in a hotel at an all-you-can-eat buffet dinner.   Can't move. Literally.   My stomach hurts. Hoping it goes down soon! #WhyDoIDoIt?
@KirsteenV aww thank you! Have a good time x
@tallwoman oh yes! I'd forgotten about that
I get that factor 20 suncream means x20 time before you burn. What good does reapplying do then? Surely it's still the original x20?
@oh_bradley a week
And the holiday begins... @ Ajaccio, Corsica http://t.co/MUw2Vpju3R
Keanu Reeves really is fit in The Matrix
@shelle_81 September
Tonight's Surgery @DrRadhaModgil and myself are talking about #CrohnsDisease if you need help or have Qs @BBCR1 from 9pm
@forcrohns thank you. We're aiming to do it right tonight
Avoid Westfield West London. An incident means whole place closed. It's Hell on earth - thousands of people barely moving.
Have a great Pride day to everyone out celebrating today xx 👬👭❤️🌈
@Yuddylicious Happily Emile took her out for a walk to let me sleep :)
I had one job to do this morning before my 11am gym session: wake up.   I failed. I am now late. #frustrating
@JimHearson I knew that! She doesn't have a real one does she?
Today @Queen_UK is visiting the set of @GameOfThrones PLEASE can someone from @BritishMonarchy put ma'am on the Iron Throne! #RealQueen

Ooh Google Glass is available in the UK. If anyone wants to buy me a pair you'll have a friend for life!
Taking my sister and niece to @WickedUK we're SO EXCITED!
@giles_harriet @LydiaHoney1 awww!
@katierselliott Oh that's terrible! I'm so sorry, what specifically?
Tonight's Surgery we're talking about unhealthy relationships with @StaceyDooley1 @NikkiSanderson @DrRadhaModgil 03700100100 if you need us
There's a special guest sitting in on The Surgery tonight! My 6 year old niece Elan :) http://t.co/ekzZeUNC6d
The competition's been won! Here's the answer: https://t.co/p2XBSAAHHB
@JAMESINREHAB someone hasn't upgraded their phone!
What a gorgeous day! Drive to work in Central London was a joy!!
Can someone PLEASE guess the right answer on the @BBCR1 competition. I want to go home to bed!

I've been working on Seize Summer competition. If you want to win a pair of tickets to @GlastoFest Tunein to @dev_101 on @BBCR1 Sat at 8am
@BooellisJames James, are you just sending me a stream of consciousness.
An old man just sneezed on me on the tube. Actual snot.   I feel violated
@TheBiancaDelRio looking forward to seeing you in London!
@Dougle666 slowly does it - had my first brief jog today. Waiting anxiously for tomorrow to find out if it hurts! :)
@Dougle666 it's a myth!
@stuartdgray I did half way through the gig. Got very excited
@gabicox12 we are! Either this week or next

@GeraldsTweeting *belatedly* hi
Think 'Xbox On' problems are very funny - but a warning sign for Siri, Ok Glass and Google Now! On air: 'Siri, text hi to 81199'
@ThisisDavina oh no - you've got me going now too!
This opening ceremony is on the boring side! #WorldCup
@harryfo see you there
@Chris_Stark me too! Cinemas and shopping centres are empty!
Love working at the @bbc bumped into @Schafernaker who gave me a personalised weather report (sunny off-and-on for a fortnight!)
@richmoney70 thank you Richard
@zort70 true
@richmoney70 hello! The series was amazing. This episode, for me, not so much
Well that was disappointing #GoT
@DynamoTightstar oh no! Why?
Seeing as tonight's #GameOfThrones is ep 9 of the series are we set for a good one?
Depressing fact to go to bed on http://t.co/1R9xbP0qcf
@criesnovelli yes please
Thank you to everyone who took part in tonight's Surgery! Amazingly diverse range of calls and texts! You kept @DrRadhaModgil on her toes!!
I'm going to miss talking to @danisnotonfire and @AmazingPhil !

@James_Saye good idea. Thanks James
Opinions please: Surround speakers in the living room or soundbar? #TechOpinion
@PrincessNardz nice!
@PrincessNardz what's with the hashtag?
Morning! x
Morning! On a video editing course today. Apparently it's radio with pictures!

Tonight's Surgery with me &amp; @DrRadhaModgil we're focusing on self harm and why people do it. If this is of interest to you, @BBCR1 at 9pm!
@virginmedia I've sent it
@virginmedia is it still worth sending it in? (that is, is it the same person today as yesterday? )
So that's 5 hours waiting for @virginmedia and no show... Doing up the flat this week is going to be a long one!
@AdPaylor yay! Thank you Adam. And thank you for the sweets! It got us through the final hours!!
We did it! We're on air! #AccessAllAreas Studio! @BBCR1 @1Xtra

1 hour till #AccessAllAreas Studio is on @BBCR1 @1Xtra and this is my view... It's fine. It's fine... http://t.co/U52udDK3WC
&gt;2 hours and still mixing. Now officially behind schedule and stress is kicking in! Good news though everyone's included! #AccessAllAreas
3 hours to go and we're placing the beds and music down on the #AccessAllAreas Studio show for @BBCR1 and @1Xtra
Under 5 hours to go and @AntDanbury and I are still rough editing the show. Argh! #AccessAllAreas Studio.
11 hours and counting... #AccessAllAreas Studio show on @BBCR1 @1Xtra
The #AccessAllAreas Studio is now closed!!! Woo-hoo! Now I've got just over 24hours to edit 39 hours of content into an hour show!!!
Final day of #AccessAllAreas Studio!
@AdPaylor it'll feel like we're missing someone over the next couple of days! Thanks for all your help! You've been amazing.
@AdamColeberd sorry Adam! I've now been corrected
