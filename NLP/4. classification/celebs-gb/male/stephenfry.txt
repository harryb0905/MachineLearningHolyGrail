@_recklesslife_ I think perhaps you may be the lost one here. To say one is sorry is to express a feeling of sorrow. Such sorrow may spring from remorse or guilt, but certainly not always. The word by no means connotes culpability. For example "I am sorry you tweeted" is a fair statement, no?

How @PhilTaylor can take himself out of the moment and waste his time with silly interactions with friends in the crowd just before a crucial shot is more than I can comprehend. Imagine if he were focussed all the time ... #Lovethedarts
Lordy lordy lord. Double Crossed, outscored and blown away by @RobCross180 who looks to be the future of darts. My mouth had been hanging open for the last hour and a half. Stunning.
The beauty of this match is that there‚Äôs no bad outcome (unless aliens land and zap everyone with acidic custard) #Lovethedarts
Merciful heavens! I am not alone in my trousers.  #Lovethedarts

When one year ends and another begins I often think of T. S. Eliot‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Gidding‚Äù ‚Äì  Last season's fruit is eaten  And the full-fed beast shall kick the empty pail.  For last year's words belong to last year's language  And next year's words await another voice ‚Ä¶
What we call the beginning is often the end And to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.
And somehow this line seems rather apt too:-  ‚Ä¶ the conscious impotence of rage At human folly, and the laceration Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.  Here's to 2018

@Pott__ Orwell was surprisingly (and often shockingly) conservative about many things ... much to disagree on, but an observation is either true or it isn't. Doesn't matter who says it, or whatever else they may have said that is untrue. No?
@ThatVDOVault Unorthodoxy would be heterodoxy, I should say. Smells faintly of cider ...
Orwell on Charles Dickens: "[he had] ‚Ä¶ a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.‚Äù Yup. "Smelly little orthodoxies" Sounds right.

@Appleamberuk I may be wrong, but I had heard they are reinventing Seaworld without captive orcas. Hope it‚Äôs true. Still so much to be done‚Ä¶
@InvertedSpiral Which is to say Gower right-handed but batted left-handed‚Ä¶
@jacobthegoose At least I think that‚Äôs the one you mean. I don‚Äôt watch myself I‚Äôm afraid. Garrick Club is known as cucumber and salmon.
@jacobthegoose It‚Äôs a Garrick Club tie. I‚Äôm afraid you have to be a member to wear it ‚Ä¶
@InvertedSpiral David Gower too, of course ‚Ä¶
@Appleamberuk Indeed - I tweeted about it many times when it came out. Glad to hear that Seaworld is going for a reboot - without orcas!
That Rolls Royce throwing action of @Raybar180‚Ä≤s is all the more amazing when you consider that he is naturally a left-hander. #SkyDarts
Well @DaveClarkTV and @SkySportsDarts - how did @PhilDTaylor win!? #SkyDarts If smiles got you to the final @sbunting180 would romp home
@TheStuartWalker OK, you win!

In the end found a bit of respect for Huybrechts, faintly bonkers as he appears to be. He gave @PhilDTaylor a hell of a game ‚Ä¶
@cookie_swfc It's just me I'm sure. No logic to it and i don't attempt to defend my feeling. But it is strong!
@DonnaLusher Looks away‚Ä¶
Hm @pally111 Well oddly I do. It's illogical i suppose because his antics are even more extreme. They just seem less pugnacious. Just me?
Very hard to warm to Huybrechts with all those posturing antics. #lovethedarts

@Shizaroo Er, yes. That‚Äôs kind of the point. It‚Äôs similar to asthma in that regard. A chronic condition. As yet no cure. No single reason.

@acio999 The clue‚Äôs in the title of the book I think you‚Äôll find
RT @iBooks: Thank you for joining us #AskStephenFry #FryDay Sorry it had to be only half an hour. I‚Äôm zooming off now. Thanks all!
.@pancakedays @iBooks Changes every day. Today it‚Äôs Twentieth Century, directed by Howard Hawks. The best of the 30s screwball comedies IMHO
.@iBooks @lenthorn That there‚Äôs no Dark Side of the Moon. Ask Pink Floyd for your money back.
.@iBooks @benjanilowe Minaj! Gretchen Wilson, Carrie Underwood. Lots of bluegrass too. Electro swing‚Ä¶
@herrrpunkt @ibooks I meant ‚Äúnovella‚Äù not ‚Äúmove‚Äù !
.@herrrpunkt @ibooks Mann‚Äôs Tod in Venedig is a move I guess, but it‚Äôs just about perfect!
.@iBooks ‚Äîvalue and depth and melody and lifelong glory. That‚Äôs my hope anyway! x
.@iBooks ‚Äî make music a ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô or suggest hierarchies of value. Secretly play great music around the house and suddenly they‚Äôll get the‚Äî
.@iBooks @PlacidoDomingo Well as Dorothy Parker said ‚Äúyou can lead a whore to culture but you can‚Äôt make her think‚Äù ‚Ä¶ pointless to try and‚Äî
.@ChrisReimer @iBooks Very very very very very much
.@RoeHogwarts Sad friendly old Hufflepuff. And proud of it.
.@OurWordsCarry @iBooks Wow. The sonnets. The works of Auden. Much of Tennyson. Whitman. Oh must I choose?
.@iBooks It maddens &amp; saddens me I have no talent for it, but it means absolutely everything to me. It can‚Äôt cure, but it can be such a balm
.@Epigrammist @iBooks Hmmm - a cross between Berlin, Amsterdam, Venice and New York if that could be arranged
.@Fryphile @iBooks @MoreFoolFry Oh the latter! It might even have led me to the former. Who knows? It was also better and truer.
.@KangarooAlice @iBooks I try to be as honest (about myself) as I possibly can...
.@iBooks So so hard to answer. Playing Oscar Wilde a once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity. But then being on stage with Mark Rylance hard to beat!
.@iBooks I would like to try writing just using pencil and paper. As I do with poems
.@iBooks Ever since I‚Äôve written I‚Äôve used  either a typewriter or word processor: the latter is so part of me that it‚Äôs hard to know.
@WendyStelzmann @iBooks Coo. It varies all the time. Beware of Pity by Stefan Zweig at the moment. Under The Volcano by Malcolm Lowrie...
@phd88keys @MoreFoolFry @iBooks I‚Äôm afraid the US is a different publishing territory. It‚Äôs a longstanding legal thing. Afraid I don‚Äôt know
.@iBooks Probably this one. I have to learn not to trust my propensity to disaster and crisis.
@w0lvesno2 @iBooks Don‚Äôt think I suggest imply or so much as hint that it does, I‚Äôm glad to say.
@Suzy_Baines @iBooks Oscar Wilde and Biggles x
@SarahPietrzak @iBooks With difficulty!
.@iBooks Well, gossipy as it is probably the time the Prince and Princess of Wales came to tea. It seems to entertain people &amp; it's all true
.@iBooks I tried to tread a line between hand-wringing self-pity and what look like bragging. Drugs are dangerous, but I have to entertain
@iBooks Here I am! #AskStephenFry
