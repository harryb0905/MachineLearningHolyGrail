@ItsAndyRyan @AndrewNadeau0 I was (briefly) in the Deathly Hallows pt1 and also (Briefly) in St. Trinians 2 with David Tennant and Toby Jones... Can I go in the Northern Rockers box?

You don’t see many men with centre partings these days.
Do you ever have a dream stick with you all day? I dreamed I was looking at a photo that made me sad and I’ve felt like that all day. It was a girl from school in a top hat.

@KaronAthies Sorry if your tweet was meant to be positive about the show Jo and I did. I didn’t mean to offend you if it was. I was just struggling to work it out.
@KaronAthies @BBCRadio2 I don’t understand this. It’s just words put together badly. Can you write it again so I can make sense of it?
@SusanBarley9 My opinion does not matter. I’m just a fun guy filling in while Si is having a break. What does matter is that if the biggest upheaval in your life is a schedule change you should feel thankful and blessed not bitter and ugly inside.
@pvcprinting @KaiserChiefs @peanutkaiser @vjthedrummer @curlywand @WhiteyKaiser Hope yr doing good. Eat everything they tell you too and watch too much telly. Feel happy and know that we’re thinking of ya. Xx

@SusanBarley9 I shouldn’t chip in but I must. I’ve taken everyone else off this. To call Jo a ‘Festival DJ’ is insulting and ill informed. She’s one of our greatest broadcasters who is not only loyal to the listeners but also the BBC. Pop your bubble and see the musical landscape she tends to.

@bbdt2018 @elenajday @13lindy14 @BBCRadio2 @mcgregor_ewan @jowhiley Technically an Ivor Novello award is a talent competition I suppose.
@DavidJa51564405 @BBCRadio2 @mcgregor_ewan @jowhiley Fantastic first tweet David. Really getting into the spirit of twitter. Negativity from the off. Perfect.

@iforgot09 @thesizzlebitch @thegrandtour @DavidHasselhoff @JeremyClarkson Alright pal. Stop atting (@) me or lighten the heck up. America is not officially been named the best country. It’s not like the World Series so America doesn’t always get to be the best. Especially in the current climate. Which is changing by the way.

I like mac demarco (is that how you spell it) by the way. That's why I chose him. I know he'd understand my fury.
But I'm not going to buy a Nissan just because it prevented me from reading about Mac Demarco or something.
My friend Craig's mum had a Nissan the 90's and we thought it was pretty cool cos the top came off and you could put it in the boot.
I find it hard to believe that the Nissan advert preventing me from reading an NME article about Friendly Fires will sell any more Nissans.

On the last record I could always tell the reviewers who hadn't listened to it if they didn't mention the Bill Nighy bit 😂😂
... even the bad stuff. It would still mean they had had to listen to it so the jokes on them 😂
Listened to our new LP (Stay Together) on the way to work this morning and thought I really can't wait to hear what you think of it.
Tomorrow's 'Round-Up' topics... •Scart Issues •Phil's Bar •Escalator Etiquette  •L-O-Hell •Present Tension •Downdate •Kaiser Tossing •X-Mas?
Midnight in the U.K.  I'll be live on Radio X in 11 hours. That gives me enough time to write the show. (You know I just make it up right..)

@Whitefryar I'll speak to our agent today. It won't be as big a gig, but we'll play just as hard.
@Whitefryar We will alway want and love to play Scotland. But our booking agent must not see it possible during this 9 gig run.
@Whitefryar ...tickets there. It doesn't mean we won't play there. It just means we can't take an arena tour there.
@Whitefryar There is no "too lazy" quote then... I would love to do a huge tour of the Caribbean too but the fact is we can't sell enough..
@Whitefryar @Dave8001 @KaiserChiefs @RadioX Where are you getting this "too lazy" quote?

This guy is #TheVoiceUK amazing!
I'm supposed to #thevoiceuk where appropriate.
(Not Emma)
I like the look of this bruiser.
I think P had a wise and brave point there. She deserves a bit of respect for that.  It was still weird though.
Told you it was weird...
i before e except after c... Unless it's weird.
Isn't weird spelt weird.
This is weird.
I'm so glad I didn't wear my tinfoil hat.
Who are these guys?!?   ! They could win this.
Erm... Gosh... Hugh Grant... Erm... Eeeeerm.   Any that's my pitch.
Yeh.. Too perfect... That's what I was gonna say P ;)
It's SO obvious when I'm gunna turn! Hide it you fool.
I always thought a bun fight was like a posh thing. With a bred roll. Not an iced bun.
That's me!! On the telly!! ! The one in the green tie.
I read in The Telegraph they had to move me and will's dressing rooms... Yeh... Cos that's what they do........
Ring takeaway! Chill booze! Boil a kettle! Empty bladders! Leave the ketchup bottle upside down! Light that expensive candle with dust on!
Hello. Brace yourself for some light entertainment. The Voice episode 4 is moments away!
@sleafordmods Have Fun.
@tomkmilner Distinguished. I'm like a fine wine... I'm expensive and I'll get you drunk.
@Eyeeye72 I read your note and I'm sure it's all cool. I'll let management know too though. X
@MattBlackVinyl Ha! I sometimes say that to myself when I arrive somewhere and I'm a bit nervous...
@NiallMDoherty I'm going over the fence. And I'm not coming back 'til I find a dead body.
The Burbs is on ITV4 (UK) I think it's in my top 10 Tom Hanks films.

I'm happy to step aside if Bieber, Turner, Drake and Coolio wanna do it #LordMarmalade
To clarify, it wouldn't be a cover of Lady Marmalade, it would be a new song that four sassy lads would write specifically #LordMarmalade
Alex Turner should probably be in it #LordMarmalade
I think will would be up for it #LordMarmalade
Just putting it out there, but I'd love to get together with three other sassy male singers and do a song called 'Lord Marmalade'

But saying that. This coffee is excellent.
I should probably leave it for a bit. These Tweets are distracting from my important ones about ticket sales and my charity work.
It's cos I'm in a cafe next to the studio waiting for it to open.
Busy old morning for me in Twitter isn't it. Quite out of character really.

You won't believe the amount of shit I got from my team backstage for not turning for him. #thevoiceuk
@BBCTheVoiceUK To sit on my throne as the prince of Saltaire.
I slept with the Fresh Prince. He said 'small ya later' :(  #thevoiceuk
I love it when I can watch other people pitch and fight over something. Especially P and G. It's real funny. #thevoiceuk
I like her fella's 'look' #thevoiceuk
Were you all worried he was gunna flip me? 😳
I could have taken him, but it wouldn't have made 'good TV' #thevoiceuk
This guy is good.  At what age did I start clicking my fingers when I dance? (#thevoiceuk)
By the way, all these tweets should be accompanied by #thevoiceuk
Always be nice to people on the way up.... Cos you'll never see them again.
She always had her fingers in the till.
I once mimed the violin at Leeds Town hall cos I wasn't good enough. They put fairy liquid on my bow so it didn't make a noise.
Rap Attack for X-Mas number 1.
I think I remember that 'rap' better than P does... 😳
Can you tell that I like it when we all turn round? It makes good TV.
If you don't want to watch @BBCTheVoiceUK you can turn to the snooker on BBC2. They're all in waistcoats too.
Wasn't Marvin's JLS colour green?
You can do a lot with a violin.
I'll go tomorrow.
I still haven't seen the new Star Wars.
Voice is on.
What vegetable is 'sort of' cool? A Rad-ish.

How's it going? #thevoiceuk
3 minutes to go until #BBCTheVoiceUK starts. Just enough time to listen to a perfect pop song.
GUYS!! 1 hour to go until @BBCTheVoiceUK 2016!! (Lads, remember that you don't have to tweet me to tell me you won't be watching;)
Just went to the Oliver Spencer fashion show and had my flies undone the entire time.
It's @BBCTheVoiceUK day today. Tune your sets to Channel 1 at 7:30pmtonight. #TheVoiceUK https://t.co/o3x8eWzOt7
If you buy 1 album today, but Blackstar by David Bowie. If you buy 2 get Big World by @steviemccrorie
Yo. If you voted for @steviemccrorie to win The Voice last year prove you were right by buying his album. Out today!
There's nothing more terrifying than an old servants bell going off in the dead of night.  Especially if you don't have them.
Even if you've never watched @BBCTheVoiceUK or heard of @steviemccrorie you can still check him out if you have 5 mins.
Attention @BBCTheVoiceUK viewers. If you voted for @steviemccrorie to win last years show, prove you were right by buying his album Friday.

That gives you just enough time to get round to a friends house who has @sky1. You could pick up some beers on the way.
Later on tonight, #BringTheNoise is on @sky1. Specifically, it's on at 9pm.
@Jaynesharp A constant concern.

Some more guys have turned up dressed as policemen. They've even decorated their Vauxhalls! Excellent stuff.
