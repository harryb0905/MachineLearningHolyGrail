@JeffBezos I’m no legal expert, but I think you should settle.
@Deplorable_Skip Liar.
@ruudboy @tomcoates why do we use a euphemism? To avoid saying something distasteful, to protect someone’s feelings, etc. To soften the meaning of that which said directly would be uncomfortable - for both parties. Why do this with Trump? The most brazen liar in living memory?
@tomcoates points taken but I disagree. Without checking I’m sure he said five things today that are self-evident lies. It’s fear of using that word. Social pressure. Fear of appearing disrespectful. Something personal about it. Fear of Trump taking offence. “Sir, that’s a lie.”
Donald Trump tells lies. All the time. Every speech, every interview, every rally, every press conference, every tweet. Why don’t interviewers respond “that’s a lie”? Why no headlines “Trump Lies About X”? This fear of the word ‘lie’ is the worst form of political correctness.
Happy Birthday 2019!

Ok I'll let you all know when my LIVE commentary will be. Soon! Night night xx
I can do a pretty good commentator voice. What's the easiest way to stream me doing live audio? Anyone know?
Btw have not been watching the game.
I'm stopping now. For the next game I think I'll do an actual live commentary that you can stream, would you listen?
Now it's time to activate the invisiball
And here's another nine goals, bam, bam, bam. Three per kick.
It's this ball's last game before retirement. He's 74 this year, which in human years is way into the three-hundreds.
The ball is from a long line of World Cup footballs.
Looks like the ball may have injured one of its leather pentagons, but no, play on he says. Kick me. What a sportsball.
The ball is being questioned
Nice underground goal there that obviously we can't see, but the radar doesn't lie. Goal.
England haven't won a World Cup since 2007 so these goals are like manna from nirvana for them
Here are those goals we've all been waiting for....
Let's take another look at that goal. This isn't a replay, the players are re-enacting the goal at half speed. Ball is filled with helium.
That's a cheeky little goal!
And there's another goal.
Except when he's happy he can sometimes feel what is known as 'phantom wagging'
Football fact: Tonight's referee was born with a vestigial tail. It was removed shortly after birth and he suffered no ill effects.
Now that's a great goal from the ref. Showing both teams how it's done.
Actually hang on no they are continuing playing
And that's it it's all over
OKay goal, I could probably have done a better goal.
Another pretty good goal
Nice goals there, from everyone.
A game of football is in progress.......
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No goal.............
No goal still..........
Kicking again, still no goal..........
No goal....................
Kicking, but no goal............
Still no goal..........
No goal...............
No goal...........
No goal....
Mini goal.
DOUBLE GOAL!!!!!!!!!
*spoiler alert* GOAAALLLLLL !!!!!!!!
ANOTHER GOAL!!!!!
GOAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
GOAAALLLLLL!!!!!!!!
