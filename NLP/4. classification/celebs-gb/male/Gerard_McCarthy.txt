@DJLadyLloyd Bradley’s character fucks up so much throughout the movie, but it’s  Scene 98 where Ally finally gets angry.... because he calls her “ugly”?!   Really?! That’s what tips her over the edge?!  I wanted her to laugh in his face when he said it!!
@DJLadyLloyd Any more than that? As I said, I enjoyed the movie.... but I am struggling and have seriously been thinking “maybe I need to see it again. Maybe I missed something”.   So if you think I’ve got it wrong, please tell me how. X https://t.co/sViB9MH28o
But I cannot understand why you would choose to tell this story!   Anyway, rant over.   As I said, I enjoyed it. But Christ, I can’t think of a weaker female character since Cinderella.   Thoughts? Have I got this entirely wrong??
The same woman with “a big nose” who crushed the music industry, refused to conform, was true to herself and who very few men can compete with artistically or vocally!   Thank you Gaga for showing the world that in 2018 women like Ally are no longer the norm.
“Woman cannot be great without the helping hand of a man” seems to be the message.   However, reality gives us a nice dose of irony when the credits roll and we find out that the mind blowing moments in the film (ie. the songs performed by Gaga!) were indeed written by a woman!
I mean.... WHAT?!   WHAT DOES SHE ACTUALLY DO FOR HERSELF?! Nothing that I can see.
But wait.... before man tops himself, he writes a BELTER of a song for her to sing thus providing her with another opportunity to show to the world how great she can be.
Oh, but man has an addiction problem, so when he’s trying to deal with that and leaves girl to be successful by herself, she becomes a bit naff, a bit commercial, not true to herself.
It seems to me that the message of the movie is: girl has great voice and gets discovered by successful man. He gives her opportunity, exposure &amp; encouragement and she too becomes successful.
I’m not sure. But I’m seriously struggling to find another leading female character in a movie as weak and outdated as Ally (Lady Gaga’s character).
Or maybe it’s because this script was written by three men....
I enjoyed it. Honestly, I did. Gaga does a great job (as does everyone else in the cast) and Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut is raw, unflashy &amp; honest.   Here’s my issue tho:   And maybe it’s because it’s based on a story that is 81 years old....
Ok, so, I saw the movie ‘A Star Is Born’ and I’ve not been able to stop thinking about it.  Here are my thoughts, if you’re interested.... https://t.co/0bYaNfMw1W

@MatthewCaputo_ @ITV @ktbradders Guys, I think it’s a conversation to be had with your agent(s) instead of ITV.... wasn’t billing negotiated &amp; agreed? If not, why not?   Nevertheless, you were both brilliant and had me tapping my feet like Billy Elliott on 6 cans of Monster! X
So, Uncle Lewis.... what was that you were saying?   Little boys don’t dress like princesses, eh ?? https://t.co/87N85PVBIn
Dear @LewisHamilton,   If you’re going to employ people to write apologies for you, it’s really useful if it’s believable that you wrote it yourself.   ie. “in character”  Now, I know lots of screenwriters &amp; playwrights that I could recommend, but here’s my submission...   G. https://t.co/C5RM2720MK
To clarify: if your nephew asks for a specific Christmas present from Santa Claus and is lucky enough to receive it, telling the child ON CHRISTMAS DAY that he shouldn’t have asked for that gift &amp; his enjoyment of it makes you “sad” makes you a pretty shit Uncle.
Can’t wait to read Lewis Hamilton’s apology statement about how much he “doesn’t mean a word of it” &amp; “is sorry for anyone who might be offended”, of course written by PR whose Boxing Day has been ruined because they’re hungover &amp; doing damage limitation for a gold medal halfwit. https://t.co/gFTmoV9X4b

Theresa, I know you’re eventually going to get to the single market &amp; customs union/NI border/national security issues and a whole host of other headaches for 2018, but I just wanted to say your taste in passport colours is spot on, babes.

@HarrisonClark92 Your rollercoaster finished me off H! X
@RickyASchroeder I once saw a drama (prob ‘The Following’), or a film, and it was the thing that made the cops initially suspicious of the suspect: he didn’t yawn after the questioning officer did, therefore he lacked empathy.   Apparently. 🤷🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/MqOqVIBcJA

The President elect of the USA has just agreed to pay 25 MILLION DOLLARS in a fraud case but let's carry on talking about the musical, yeah?
So... billionaire who is too greedy to pay taxes, gives away 25 Million because he "didn't do anything wrong"?!  Sure, Mr Trump. 👍🏼
@anniewallace Maybe I'm ahead of everyone else, but shouldn't trans actors be playing non trans roles?!  Isn't that the point of acting?! 🤔
@anniewallace @BBCCasualty Don't see the problem. We're all actors! You're not really a school teacher.... right?!
The irony of @realDonaldTrump supporters saying actors shouldn't have opinions but electing a game show host for President. #BoycottHamilton

In 35 years, that drawer in your kitchen filled with plastic bags is worth more than your savings account.
Rich men go to strip clubs and throw plastic bags at the dancers. Footballers start wearing suits made of plastic bags to display wealth.
The head of the carrier bag mafia fills a room with five pence pieces. He dives in like Scrooge McDuck, laughing the entire time.
As men stand on street corners and open their trenchcoats to display stolen plastic bags, a bag floats down the street. A revolution begins.
Young people are forced to get their plastic bags from bag dealers in back alleys. Plastic bag related violence is the most reported crime.
The year is 2050. Only the uber rich can transport their shopping with ease. The trade in black market plastic bags is ruining the economy.
@CWarnerDrake no wonder he's your idol!
