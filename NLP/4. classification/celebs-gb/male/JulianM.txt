Obama! http://t.co/WdyE0RFU
@jamiechung1 incredible memory!
@k8eb8e People should vote whatever their politics. I think Obama will make a stronger America &amp; that's better for everyone the world-over.
From a rally in Pittsburgh a week before he became President. Four more years! http://t.co/oTR0T4c8
@WrenKingston_ this year.
@WrenKingston_ You can’t look out for all American’s when you don’t care about 47% of them.
A lot of people want you to stay home tomorrow. Don't let yourself be spoken for. Get in line and vote.
@xoxo_marina_ I think Obama has achieved a huge amount that Americans can be really proud of. I’d love to see him get a second term.
@iStanForDamon gave her a hug on set
@justShika can’t as not a US citizen but encouraging all my friends to do so.
@itzJeffy nicely done!
@itssamdids nice
