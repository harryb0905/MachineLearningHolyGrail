@davwheeler As much as Norm would love me there, sadly I can‚Äôt mate!
It is an incredible lineup, and I think the cost of a Rainbow Pass for the weekend that includes watching Ariana and Years And Years, plus access to everything else, is worth it. A very exciting new era in Manchester‚Äôs Pride weekend @ManchesterPride https://t.co/GMHZI2U3Bx

I‚Äôve watched the @TheAcademy Oscars  live since as long as I can remember. In the words of QAF‚Äôs Alexander Perry, sorry...it‚Äôs compulsory!

As a mate of @Agerrard1, who played for @WidnesRL since he was a young lad, I whole-heartedly support this appeal. Rugby League does so much for the town/city where the club resides.

Perhaps the most important part of today for me was meeting Cyrus Thatcher‚Äôs parents Helena and Robin. Cyrus was killed in action in Afghanistan on June 2nd.

Waiting 4 years to seek mental health support is too long. That‚Äôs how long it‚Äôs taking the average Veteran to speak up, and it‚Äôs stigma‚Äôs fault.

Also, one of my best friends has been secretly away for nearly 7 months, in Iraq. It‚Äôs been the longest time not having him home. I‚Äôve missed him so much, and worried myself sick. But he‚Äôs just texted me to say that‚Äôs he‚Äôs landed in the UK. I‚Äôve come into the hall to have a cry
9pm on @ITV... The PARAs - Men Of War  Please tune in. You‚Äôll be pleased you did. It‚Äôs a fascinating and unique insight behind the wire. And I‚Äôve got mates in it too!  @TheParachuteReg @BritishArmy  #TheParas

So here are the photos! https://t.co/c55N3g4lIU
Earlier in the year, I was very lucky to be invited to go on the 2PARA specialist weapons live-firing cadre. It was a bit of a secret squirrel mission at the time but seeing as the documentary is about to be screened, it seems apt to show you the photos! @ITV @TheParachuteReg
On Thursday, @ITV at 9pm the new ‚ÄúPARAs - Men Of War‚Äù @TheParachuteReg documentary starts. Earlier in the year I got to see some of it being filmed, which was really exciting. I was allowed to watch them do the milling. It was a first for me, and I loved it!
That was sensational. Very proud of @YayItsBrandee @dancingonice
I‚Äôm roaring here. The GC for the final!!! @dancingonice @missgemcollins
This is the best thing I‚Äôve EVER seen @missgemcollins @dancingonice

Just been to watch @MaryPoppins, which is utterly divine. Emily Blunt is flipping brilliant! And Ben Wishaw singing A Conversation at the beginning of the film is absolutely heartbreaking. Practically perfect etc. Go see!
Thinking of you today, Snowball. I hope wherever you are, you‚Äôre feeling the sun from both sides x
Haha. I could‚Äôve watched again straight after. It‚Äôs a brilliant film. If I‚Äôd have seen it last night, it would‚Äôve been my favourite film of 2018. As it stands, it‚Äôs my favourite film of 2019... https://t.co/wukXsy9Pkk
I can confirm that @The_Favourite is big and bananas, camp as tits, exquisitely made and we loved every minute of it. The three women are glorious. Go see it.

@CurtisRawcliffe You‚Äôre just taking the Mickey now. I mean, come on, Curt. I think this conversation has reached its natural end now. Thank you, next.
@CurtisRawcliffe I know exactly what your thoughts are Curt. They are there for all to see. You are totally against free movement and what it represents, whilst freely moving through other countries and benefitting from the opportunities they present. The very epitome of entitlement and hypocrisy
So a bit like the free movement of people in the EU? You literally want exactly what the EU represents but want to deny that for others? But you‚Äôre British so you should be able to do as you please? Is that what you‚Äôre saying? Total hypocrisy. I‚Äôm alright Jack, pull the ladder up https://t.co/6xORGCCueT
@CurtisRawcliffe I just read through your feed Curt. You‚Äôre obsessed with immigrants in the UK. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how you can be so vehemently against immigration in the UK, whilst living as an immigrant in Australia? I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre a self-serving, hypocritical Tory, but others might.
@CurtisRawcliffe You don‚Äôt want to remain in the EU. That‚Äôs your decision. You also don‚Äôt want to remain in the UK, and have moved to Australia, where you ‚Äúcannot wait‚Äù to become an Australian citizen.  Ergo, leave the politics of the country you left, to the people that didn‚Äôt. Capiche?!
@CurtisRawcliffe Curt. You‚Äôre out of your depth here. You didn‚Äôt read my tweet properly. The PM has today spoken in Parliament. I quoted what she said about the ‚Äúintegrity of British Politics‚Äù. You misinterpreted that, and made it personal, in a tweet about me, to me. ‚Äúsame old lefties‚Äù.
@CurtisRawcliffe Yep. Been to Australia. Worked there, Hun. Never said anything about me travelling or otherwise. Again - you made that up. Went there to work. Never said you shouldn‚Äôt emigrate there. I replied to your juvenile and ignorant tweet to me. Which, by the way, YOU misread totally.
#travelling https://t.co/I0iH7Dg2JE
@CurtisRawcliffe Travelling?! Moving to your auntie‚Äôs house and joining the Aus Army. Okaaaaaay Curt!!!
@CurtisRawcliffe Historically, you‚Äôve always had trouble knowing what was, and wasn‚Äôt yours, haven‚Äôt you? I mean, babes, you weren‚Äôt even capable of keeping your hands off a t-shirt that didn‚Äôt belong to you, let alone lecture me on the country you abandoned. I think you can wind your neck in!
@CurtisRawcliffe Says the boy that ran away to Oz?! You concentrate on Australian politics yeah? I mean...Curt...really?!?!
‚ÄúA second referendum could damage the integrity of British politics‚Äù. The integrity went out of the window quite a while ago, along with the bathwater, the baby, and the bolting horse. Is this some kind of Brass Eye spoof? I mean, seriously - Are you okay, Hun?!

I salute you Sir https://t.co/kp3HCRgOyM
@KathyBurke @Blobby_Official @Beige29 This is everything.
Looking forward to meeting a @BritishArmy veteran and @SSAFA beneficiary tomorrow, to film a piece for an @ITV Christmas special. Stay safe, folks x
You pointedly commented about the Children‚Äôs Hospital. I simply referred to your tweet. Re: your latest tweet - I didn‚Äôt say I was the only one. Thank goodness I‚Äôm not! That hospital wouldn‚Äôt exist without MANY people giving their time to charity. I know that first hand. https://t.co/lMGBiGPbuD
Nothing but an honour and a pleasure. Love to you and your little one. I‚Äôll be doing a Christmas visit again in two weeks x https://t.co/iFNBjVuwdh
No. I‚Äôve been visiting the @RMCHcharity every year for 13 years. Keep up. https://t.co/VcdAuY9F0R
I‚Äôve been doing that every year, for 13 years by the way, Gobshite.
The train? From Trafford Wharf, where I work? Or from where I live in the middle nowhere at 6.30am? Good luck with that one. You could perhaps come with me to the @RMCHcharity Children‚Äôs Hospital and do a visit with me? Bring presents. Put your money where your mouth is, troll. https://t.co/dri3GzBGOu
In honour of our American friends, I‚Äôm doing a Thanksgiving Dinner. Have a happy and safe day, giving thanks y‚Äôall. #TurkeyLurkey
@ManCityCouncil Ohhhh. Silly me! I was driving round with me eyes closed! I must‚Äôve imagined the queues to get in the Arndale and Selfridges car park. And every single bay in the centre of town, full. And the roads being gridlocked - all day, every day. Should‚Äôve read a council pamphlet instead!
I‚Äôve been in Manchester City Centre for an hour. Driving round in circles. Nowhere to park. What have you done to our city @ManCityCouncil?!
My word, you are gross. https://t.co/o4Lu7yOOER

Goodbye Colchester. Thank you to GreyFriars Hotel for looking after me. Hello Windsor! What‚Äôs happening?!
Bags packed for another round of @HelpforHeroes and @BritishArmy and @RoyalNavy visits in Colchester, Windsor, Plymouth and Lympstone, with maybe a cheeky visit to @reallorraine @lorraine thrown in, to talk about our @SSAFA #WW1 campaign...

Morning twits. Sofa reupholstery. Anyone got any recommendations?!

Yesterday I spent the afternoon in Whitehall @DefenceHQ. Really enjoyed it and came away better quipped for @SSAFA and @HelpforHeroes #everydayisaschoolday
Love me some @GrouchoClubSoho breakfast! https://t.co/YqvHVtZVgb
Proper school service. I highly recommend @GC_Rail
The staff couldn‚Äôt be nicer. When I arrived at the station - ‚Äúwhere are you travelling to today sir?‚Äù. Then I walked to the platform and a brass band was playing ‚ÄúJerusalem‚Äù through the speakers, which made me well up. Then ‚ÄúGood morning sir, welcome on board‚Äù.
So. I‚Äôm currently on my inaugural @GC_Rail journey to London. So far, so great.
Had a blast at @BierkellerLinc1 tonight. Brilliant fun and a proper lovely crowd. Thank you for having me. Well done to all the winners, especially Phoebe Fortune who won 300 quid!!! See you soon for my next one!

A work thing that I was supposed to do today got cancelled because of the weather, so I‚Äôm clearing out some clothes I no longer wear, so I can take them down to @BarnabusMcr to pass on to someone that might need them. These freezing temperatures are someone‚Äôs cold, hard reality
Okay. Maybe we have got it worse than anyone else.... https://t.co/t055pCsOiO

@Vanessabooty1 No. They‚Äôd forgotten to do it. They‚Äôd updated their full site, but not the mobile one. Like I said, shoddy.
@Vanessabooty1 Indeed. I have no idea what my next few days schedule is going to be! Or indeed whether the trains with help, or exacerbate that problem! All I was pointing out was, late last night I tried to see what the updates were to sort my plans out and they hadn‚Äôt updated. Shoddy at best
@Vanessabooty1 Whilst casting no judgement about the character of a total stranger I hope Vanessa?
@Vanessabooty1 I don‚Äôt think we are! That‚Äôs the beauty of democracy!
They‚Äôd be much better off making sure they‚Äôve updated their mobile website, rather than having to waste time asking customers ‚Äúwhat can you see?‚Äù This isn‚Äôt a hobby or a charity or a volunteer based company, it‚Äôs the UK‚Äôs National Rail service in the middle of a travel crisis! https://t.co/ru6HOqIDnu
@Vanessabooty1 What has the weather got to do with the NR digital staff not knowing what‚Äôs on their own website?!
So that‚Äôs National Rail Enquiries asking ME what links, their own mobile website provides. Makes you wanna give up really, doesn‚Äôt it?! https://t.co/zO00OmZ4OW

@LindsScho @MatthewRigby16 Wow. You really are spiteful aren‚Äôt you Linds? I‚Äôve just looked through your feed on here -  it‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre consumed with jealousy or something, spitting bile to anyone that will listen. Read through my feed, you‚Äôll get a rough idea of what kind of person I am.
@BrionyTaylor93 @LindsScho Bri - you‚Äôre a liar too. I‚Äôve never said those words, or clicked my fingers at anyone. EVER. I used to work in bars, restaurants and pubs when I was younger, so I have nothing but respect for people in that line of work. I‚Äôm sad for you that you‚Äôd make up a story to try to fit in
@LindsScho That‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve only ever been there once and I can remember it vividly. @PaulCulshaw1983 was DJing and I stood next to him the whole time. Remember, Paul? So your tweet says far more about you than it does me. You‚Äôre a liar, Hun. I‚Äôm embarrassed for you Linds. The shame!
Happy 30th Birthday to my boy @KeeganHirst. Some say that you can‚Äôt choose your family. Well they are wrong - you can. He is more than my best friend, he‚Äôs my brother. Love you Keegs x https://t.co/aNQeZwBVcC

@Cobratate @domjoly It's either "Dom is", or "Dom's". I'd hate for a superior alpha male like yourself to appear stupid...
@Cobratate @Dr_Ellie She spent 5 years at medical school. You could barely last a week in the Big Brother house. I think that tells us all we need to know...
@Cobratate At least you've remembered your handbag and you're keeping it safe under that Lambo seat belt. Any thoughts on the Twitter mistakes yet?
People that shout "FACTS!" "TRUTH!" "110%!" "ALWAYS RIGHT!" "PROOF!" usually have nothing to back it up. In other words, a fool.
@Cobratate Oh dear. You've totally shown yourself up, haven't you? Very weak, don't you think?
I thought you "never delete" tweets? Or is it only ones where another man has pointed out your mistakes? Asking for a friend, Hun @Cobratate
@Cobratate Babes. You're showing weakness in every tweet.  *You're  *These
@Cobratate @HitmanHatton You okay, Hun? I've already explained this. My grammar game is strong. Awks.
@Cobratate @HitmanHatton I'm not talking about "everyone", I'm talking about Ricky. And unlike your posts, mine will always be grammatically correct.
@Cobratate @HitmanHatton So you'll concede to Ricky, and call him "friend". Not such an alpha male then? Fragile masculinity is very much a thing, and you have it...

Eh? I play a character called Sean Tully and have done for 14 years. Antony Cotton is my real name. https://t.co/HU81IuRfIK
If you think this is a rant, then you know nothing of me or indeed, the world in which you wish to be an expert. https://t.co/lZ78MqJ9Kh
What? It doesn't make sense. And you said I've only been Antony Cotton for 10 years. Why am I self-righteous when you tweeted about me? https://t.co/lZ78MqJ9Kh
No. They are our real names. You're digging a hole for yourself here. https://t.co/q0GmDWpuEV
@SuperSonicCover Are you drunk? That doesn't make sense. I've been called Antony Cotton for 30 years, since I was a child.
@SuperSonicCover The gay rights movement was started by the cissies, femme queens, the drag, the lesbians and the trans. Learn who you owe  your freedoms to
@SuperSonicCover And just to clarify, I've gone by the name Antony Cotton for thirty years, and still do.
@SuperSonicCover You've gone about this the wrong way. You sound foolish. And I f you stand by it, why delete it?
No. You named me. Do you want me to tweet your deleted tweet to remind you of exactly what you said? https://t.co/uOU9bOIEv7
@SuperSonicCover Yeah, you might well delete that tweet. I suggest you re-read your Army Values and Standards #Respect

Going to bed with a very sad and heavy heart. Hug your loved ones extra tight. And remember, the majority of people are good, kind folk x
No one should go to something as joyful as a pop concert and not come home. It's heartbreaking.
@ThatsManchester On the contrary, I was referring to people trivialising it. I have friends that were there
Just horrendous. In our beautiful and brilliant city. Devastating x
What on earth is wrong with some people? Jeez. Have a word with yourselves. To everyone else, stay safe x
All those posting fake photos and hoax tweets about the MEN - what are you doing? There are 1000s of kids there, parents at home terrified

"He set the word 'free' to a note so high, nobody can reach it. That was deliberate. Nothing on Earth sounds less like freedom to me."

@KeeganHirst What about the time (an hour ago) when you put the Megazord instructions on the fire? Is that similar?
Well I'm interested @KeeganHirst...
@KeeganHirst Rouge One is still the most intriguing
She's just said, without batting an eyelid, "I've got quite a lot riding on it"... #AVeryBritishBrothel
@DannyKirmond12 Switch to rice pudding. Oh...
And I honestly don't think anyone is going to be looking at what colour your nails are, Babes...
We're watching #AVeryBritishBrothel. There's an awful lot of bad footwear traipsing back and forth through these low level camera shots...
@KeeganHirst beg p'arn...
So @KeeganHirst bought me a mortar and pestle. Not for Christmas, just as a gift. I used it tonight. It's rather magnif.
@ExciledTrotter Anyways, when's my godchild making an appearance?!?!
@ExciledTrotter Now now Gaz. Don't be jealous...
Just upped my game @davidlloyduk and did 6K. Feel good. 45 minutes well spent.
@RAFLadiesFC And thanks for the follow!
@RAFLadiesFC Hello ladies. Anything "semi-official" sounds good to me...
Wonderful to see people connecting. Fingers crossed you can help each other. Sending love x https://t.co/npvUgQ9FsC
Scott Hetherington was a Kingsman from 2 Lancs. He died in Iraq yesterday. He was 22. Absolutely gutted   #WeWillRememberThem https://t.co/U40frF0hxt
Please take the time to read about my pal @PJEaglesham's brilliant mobility project. And then please RT if you can. Stay safe, twits x https://t.co/N5OgotiVg4
@sharonbrynin I'm okay thank you. I'll text you x
Woke up and realised, that wasn't a bad dream...
@TheLadyNirvana Thank you. He was only 22.
Oh mate. There are no words. I'm absolutely heartbroken. Rest easy, Scott x
Sometimes, Twitter seems to send some people into total insanity. And also, self-centred ego mania. Ye gods.
I am *genuinely* gobsmacked at something I've just seen on twitter. Literally lost for words at a profile that someone has retweeted. Gross.
Watching @BillyElliotUK on DVD. I'm man enough to say, it makes me cry.
We will remember them... @SSAFA @HelpforHeroes https://t.co/pULU65Zau2
The festive gout continues with aplomb...
I once had some of Michael Fassbender's cigar, in @lilliesdublin. That is not a metaphor.
Indeed they are @LindaRiley8. And I respect, admire, honour and thank each and every one of them for their service.
@TheLadyNirvana I'm all good. Just bizarre. Apparently I'm supposed to tweet only about other people's lives, not my own!
Who fancies some buttermilk chicken? @Ecclestonshire @KeeganHirst @jchealey @team_dave_?
@KeeganHirst Heathen
Who's watching "Up"? That autocorrected to washing up. I did a small LOL.
Apparently 2017 is the year of the crazy people. So far, so right.
@LindaRiley8 @TheLadyNirvana @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC Absolutely not. I have nothing further to say other than you've imagined all this
@LindaRiley8 @GoZo73 Apologise for remebering my absent male friends and then pointing out her's and @AliCamps accusation was incorrect?
@LindaRiley8 @TheLadyNirvana @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC @GoZo73 What? You're tweeting me from several media twitter accounts?
@LindaRiley8 @TheLadyNirvana @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC @GoZo73 This is very strange. I hope you've got the story you were looking for?!
@LindaRiley8 @TheLadyNirvana @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC @GoZo73 Apolgise? For what? Remembering my absent, male, friends? Absolutely not!
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @GoZo73 The friends - absent, away working and dead (suicide and KIA) that I was referring to, are all lads.
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC Is this conversation an actual thing? Is this actually happening? Are Ant &amp; Dec about to pop out?
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC So, to clarify, when I'm thinking of friends that are lads, I should mention girls too?
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC Unless of course, you're tweeting and retweeting me from several twitter accounts...
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC to both the men and women of the armed forces.
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC Diva magazine said they were happy to write an article. I posted my statement of my commitment
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC That was a reply to Diva magazine. Or is this two-pronged attack?!
@LindaRiley8 @DIVAmagazine @PhoenixHouseRC I didn't.
@DIVAmagazine @LindaRiley8 @PhoenixHouseRC Here's where you should start https://t.co/wCy6gV2RkQ
@DIVAmagazine @LindaRiley8 Good. Find some photographs of me and the many, many women, serving &amp; veteran, who I've met to at @PhoenixHouseRC
@LindaRiley8 @GoZo73 Or alternatively think, as most others have - "Oh that's lovely. Someone thinking of absent friends".
@DIVAmagazine @LindaRiley8 @GoZo73 Exactly. Ditto.
@LindaRiley8 @GoZo73 If you look back on here you'll find dozens of tweets from me referring to both the men and women of the armed forces
@LindaRiley8 @GoZo73 No it doesn't. It says exactly what I intended - last night, I was thinking of my absent friends. End of story.
@GoZo73 No. I'm not upset. I'm just trying to not have someone twist my sentiments into their own agenda. Simple as that.
@GoZo73 @AliCamps @HelpforHeroes @SSAFA Served what?
@GoZo73 I don't really see why you would want to pick this argument. Remember, you brought this to my door
@GoZo73 @AliCamps Are you saying @HelpforHeroes or @SSAFA don't recognise women's efforts?What?! Have you ever been to a recovery centre?
@GoZo73 @AliCamps @HelpforHeroes @SSAFA From my tweet about lads I know who are working, or those I was remembering? What are you on about?
@GoZo73 @AliCamps @LondonLGBTPride Well done on twisting something sentimental and heartfelt into something negative. Weird.
@AliCamps @GoZo73 @LondonLGBTPride I don't know any girls that died at war. Or killed themselves. Luckily, that's a rarity. Happy New Year.
@AliCamps @GoZo73 And as a co-chair of @LondonLGBTPride - you should know better.
@AliCamps @GoZo73 Jeez. I'm talking about people I know. Friends. They happen to be lads. Don't twist my sentiments into your own agenda
@braden1977 That says far more about you than it does me.
To all our boys who are away from home this NYE or on duty, stay safe.   To all those who sadly didn't come home, rest easy lads
Very chuffed with myself and my pie #puff #pastry #nye https://t.co/0AVDXGXuid

Does anyone actually work at the @Dalhousiehotel? Has anyone answered a phone there in the past 2 months?!?!
@adz911 You thought it was funny? So funny, you'd tweet Jeremy Clarkson? And then you retweet the Trevor Project straight after? Wow.
I've known @AnnaJaneCasey my whole life, thrilled to say she's still as mesmerising as she ever was. The epitome of a star @crucibletheatre
Off 2 @crucibletheatre 2 see @AnnaJaneCasey. You've had 2 days rest, I expect full stagey showing off, barking big notes &amp; multiple hi kicks

@derrymathews23 @boxingsecurity No, you tweeted it publicly. I saw it, because it was public and now I'm calling you out on it.
Nah mate. I'm just calling it out. Same as I would with racism. There's nothing personal in a public tweet @derrymathews23 @boxingsecurity

@KeeganHirst üëÄ
Episode 2 of #OurGirl was absolutely brilliant. Well done Keegs @michkeegan, loved it x
"Her bunny batter is spiced..." #GBBO
Design your own pizza night at ours went down a storm. Nutella in rice pudding is an acquired taste, however. You're welcome.
Have I got the job @Cirque @D_J_Rimmer? #Amaluna https://t.co/uO93o8rdPT
The last time we had weather like this, the lightening set fire to me hanging baskets. True story #oooshesastormyone
The very best of luck to @PJEaglesham in the men's shooting tonight. Read his story here, it's important https://t.co/kIGmpvlcUs #hero RT

@GPTransformer I've DM'd you
The Divine Miss T @Cath_Tyldesley at her sold out London show https://t.co/KXZkC6WJg5
@BJAofficial Hello BJA. Please can I DM you?!
Just how I like my coqs... https://t.co/CgE3izFmER
En route to @BrasserieZedel for @Cath_Tyldesley's gig. I'm expecting fancy London ways and fancy London prices...
@Cath_Tyldesley @JOJEHARVEY @PPhunt @Ecclestonshire Please don't.
@JOJEHARVEY @PPhunt @Cath_Tyldesley @Ecclestonshire I'm gagging to Shag
@PPhunt @Cath_Tyldesley @JOJEHARVEY @Ecclestonshire I'm gonna do the monster mash...
@PPhunt @Cath_Tyldesley Can't wait to see you boys!!!
Gutted @ManUtd
@stan_chow Agreed
I've just opened a bag of @MaynardsBassett Wine Gums and they are most satisfactorily red-heavy. I feel like a winner. Back to the game...
The M1 isn't as exciting as people say. Don't listen to the hype. It really isn't worth a day out, certainly.
Come on @ManUtd!!!
@daz_da_joiner Innit!
Yup. @Rosebudspeaks Indeed. Full points
I've just read the strangest news article I've EVER seen...
Indeed it is...@ExciledTrotter @JackWills
Me and @ExciledTrotter are a bit obsessed with these... @JackWills  https://t.co/NZ1GWX9jJs
@rach22uk @robinbeardo Nope. I blocked you regardless, months ago.  (unrelated)
@robinbeardo And that proves you haven't learned anything. A fool and his dignity, are soon parted...
@robinbeardo As you know, that's hard enough without someone calling for your culling, direct to your employer. Just have a think about that
You know what @robinbeardo, I'm just trying to earn a living, pay my mortgage and look after my family and friends, like everyone else.
Whilst some troll has his moment, here's my mate @jenkins2685's poem. Please share, RT and pass on #PTSD https://t.co/VmhgfjxErV
Well @robinbeardo?
Cool. Where do you work @robinbeardo? I'd like to come and critique your performance there...
Seems you want anonymity now @robinbeardo, don't you? Coward
Hey @robinbeardo, You really are grotesque, aren't you?
Yeah @robinbeardo. Of course. But it was really important to you, that you told me and my employers direct. Well done.
Thanks @robinbeardo To send me that at the end of the working week, is nothing but cruel, spiteful and vile. Says far more about you than me
Evenin'! Here's my mate @jenkins2685 poem. Please share, RT and pass on. PTSD is a very lonely, horrendous condition https://t.co/FEQwUBAw8V
Come on @BatleyRLFC - give it some welly, and bring home the bacon!!!
In a couple of hours, I'm going to post something very special that my pal @jenkins2685 has written. It's really quite beautiful...
Random question klaxon... Does anyone here know @BJAofficial?! Please RT!
Oh aye, @KeeganHirst? Even though me and @jchealey both beat you? #xboxflop
I love it! I want one!!! @HelpforHeroes @JackWills
@D_J_Rimmer What a thrill for the audience to watch a homegrown northern boy come home and knock it out of the park. Enjoy every moment, Sir
@D_J_Rimmer Absolutely loved it. You were brilliant. Nice to meet you x
Well...@KatiexMcGlynn @Ecclestonshire @Cirque not as good as your car park after party for two...
My review of @Cirque's #Amaluna... Abso-friggin-lutely amazeballs. Loved EVERY minute. Totally mesmerising.  What. A. Treat.
Here's my mum's review of @Cirque's #Amaluna...  What that woman did with her 'oop, was no one's business...
And we're in... @Cirque #Amaluna https://t.co/akMRNh4mGA
Hehe! @Cirque So am I!!!
Thank you to @HitchedSchmitz and @TCSEventsLondon for sorting us out! @Cirque #Amaluna
So excited to be on the way to the opening night of @Cirque's #Amaluna
Goodbye Catterick, @CatterickGarris @PhoenixHouseRC and @HelpforHeroes. I love you more and more each visit ‚ù§Ô∏è
@jjkingo23 Thank you John. You too. Stay in touch and stay safe x

@5WrightStuff https://t.co/4uGnIYEnpa
@5WrightStuff The PTSD problem is real and ever growing. As an ambassador @ssafa and a patron @helpforheroes, I've seen it. Deeply worrying

'Twas a noble fight @BatleyRLFC. Well done lads.
How are we still not friends with @DollyParton, @jenniemcalpine?!
@BurnleyOfficial I don't think that's enough. I've reached out to you, and you've chosen to ignore. I think the @FA should step in now...
@BurnleyOfficial Is there a reason you've not replied?
@Mark_Bennett_76 @BurnleyOfficial When someone was having their head staved in 4 years ago because they were gay, does that not matter now?
@BurnleyOfficial DM me please. There's something to discuss. And it's important.
I've just been sent something you said a few years ago @AndreGray7....
What's with all the thirsty lads on Insta? Worse than ever. Jeez. Put your clothes back on or go back to Grindr...

Good idea @KrisClough. I recommend @RMCHcharity @HelpforHeroes @SSAFA. Check out their amazing work.
@KrisClough Fingers crossed. I'm emailing someone at your head office, right now. I'll be sure to mention you, obvs...
@KrisClough *should have *to
Could you get me a job @KrisClough? I mean, I couldn't possibly dream of the dizzy heights of assistant manager but maybe something smaller?
Hey @KrisClough. I honestly don't know how long you've survived working at Northgate Vehicle Hire. Wow.
