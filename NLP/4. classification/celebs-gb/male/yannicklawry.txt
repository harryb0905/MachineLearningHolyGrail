@sfmorris @giwilliams1978 Touché, innit
@sfmorris @giwilliams1978 Um, sorry to be pedantic, but wasn’t Vox Populi the band everyone in Deutch Heute was banging on about?! #europeanconfusion
I want to send a telegram for a friend’s wedding overseas.. how do I do this? Total knowledge gap!
@GaryNunn1 Actor - female actor, male actor where specificity demands
@ms215 um, did you write this.. https://t.co/CfEtQzkVkB ? It’s brilliant. And how is Bristol btw? X
I’m intrigued by @GladysB splashing out on radio ads to spout propoganda about what the Libs have done for #NSW 4 months ahead of an election.. how about spending our money on actually delivering that stuff that matters to us rather than trying to convince us that it’s happening?
@thebodycoach You, sir, are a total legend. DM’d you and thanks for the ridiculously kind offer..
@barbhastings2 @SBS @thebodycoach So weird. You’d think with all the laws and policy around lotteries and gaming that competitions would be regulated.. but apparently you can run a competition as a brand to generate interest in your product and not have a prize at all it seems #consumerscandal
So my housemate entered a competition through @SBS to win some @thebodycoach books 2 months ago. They never arrived. Apparently SBS has a policy to never reply to “emails concerning competitions and prizes”. Interesting.. my legal brain is mulling this over 🧐
@GaryNunn1 This is the new reality. Regulation or resignation. Them’s our only options.
@GaryNunn1 I’m mainly glad that people appear to have begun to listen to each other again rather than banding together in ruts of aggressive assumption as to the experiences &amp; points of views of others..
I’ve resurrected my @StDunstansColl tie from 25 years ago especially for this show! Only 4 chances left to see me model it for your eyes only!

People’s flaws are always so much more endearing and interesting than their strengths. Makes me wish I had some too..
@GaryNunn1 It’s not possible apparently (or you have to petition FB to be able to release the list to you). When we did the second run of Screwtape in 2016 we wanted to invite the 2015 list of attendees.. most of whom had missed out on tickets.. but FB told us we’d just have to start again

John Malkovich has just shown up in #Billions season 3. This series is pure gold from start to finish. A-list actors, writers and social commentary all wrapped neatly into weekly eps of streamable joy!

I’ve managed to lock all my luggage safely inside a sturdy Antler suitcase..  But the code isn’t what I thought it was.  Trying a new combination every second will take 16 mins 49 seconds. Any more time efficient solutions? That don’t involve a knife or pliers?!
I’ve just had a haircut which makes me look like a balding Basil Brush. And I’m having new actor headshots done today.. At least I now have a very niche casting.
@sfmorris I’ve never heard of Lewisham. Is it anywhere near Ladywell Village where I grew up?!
I have to go and pick up a parcel and some dry cleaning. At times like this, I wish I had a PA. Or EA, even. Probably called Sven.
Do I actually like kombucha or am I just a sucker for zeitgeisty marketing? All the big questions in my world today..
@ozdale @abcnews Fair enough, and for the record the ‘we’ reference was refering to us and our broader community’s tendency to fully venerate or demonise people with reference to uncontextualised moments and comments.
@ozdale @abcnews Yeah, not sure I agree with that. He apologised for and retracted horribly misguided comments about AIDS and all I’ve read re supposed homophobia seems inferred rather than stated. Seems we now often choose to think that people who aren’t 100% for us are actually 100% against us
“In 25 words or fewer” even when the graphic insists on using “less”. Hats off to @karlstefanovic and @TheTodayShow for upholding the integrity of our language for all would-be morning tv competition entrants!

@ChrisMezzolesta ..when you hit a dry patch, the temptation is to take work below union rates because if you don't, someone else will..
@ChrisMezzolesta Thanks Chris. Really appreciate your time and response. I need to do more research. A tricky almost ethical dilemma because sometimes..
@ChrisMezzolesta Sincere questions and would really value your thoughts
@ChrisMezzolesta ie. how do we accept change in the industry with these types of websites/portal, still work prolifically and protect rates for all artists?
@ChrisMezzolesta Be interested to hear more from you. How do we resist this trend in a way which strengthens the industry? Feel free to DM me please!

@sfmorris We do. Not probably up to @grahnort 's standard, but they're enthusiastic and manage to generate the odd 'LOL' moment..
@adamliaw Cynical.. Yet true!
@sfmorris Yeah - I like this one. After 2 hours (and a 5am start) she's keeping me awake!
Politics (very much) to one side, this is a great song. 2nd place my prediction.. #RUS #Eurovision2015
@bbceurovision Tweet of the night!
@paddy_o_c @R2Eurovision G'day from Australia, old mate! How do you rate #aus chances from your coalface perspective?!
@a_million_beats pretty much exactly the same: Belgium, Sweden, Aus and Latvia. Serbia reminds me too much of Euphoria from a few yrs ago!
@mejohnlawley Mind.. Gutter? 😉
@a_million_beats LOVED it.. What's your fave so far?
@phil_marriott She's great, int she!
This is the one that could steal it from favourites, I reckon. It's very Lamb (circa Fear of Fours). Très cool... #LAT #Eurovision2015

@markgoodier Oh, I dunno. I think that Electro Velvet number was in the spirit of Eurovision tho they looked a little resigned to defeat!
I really like this song but performance is very, very strange. Lying on the stage? Singing about Rhythm Inside? Really?! Weird.. #BEL
@chrisnorth94 almost worth getting up at 5am to watch from this side of the world too..
COME ON 'STRAYA! Love my adoptive home and half of Europe live here anyway. Go Guy, and bring it home for all of us! #AUS #Eurovision2015

@DavidCampbell73 Sweden have pumped a lot of national resources into this entry. Points for sheer effort and ingenuity alone!

@YesYesMarsha made me feel like the grubbiest of voyeurs! Happy Eurovision - from the UK to the far corners of The Commonwealth! Xx 🇨🇦🇦🇺🇬🇧

New @kylieminogue track is brilliantly engineered - sounds like Delta's 'Top Of The World' meets Katy Perry's 'Roar'. #1 fodder, I reckon...
Enjoying this morning's #kjshow - plus, all the songs are sped up/pitch-shifted to the point my caffeine hit has been massively enhanced.
@mr_ed_phillips another monicker I'm unlikely to answer to, Eddie..
@SuperTriviaGuy Me too! Looks bloomin' awesome. How much does Samantha Jade look like Kylie Minogue in the promo clips?!

It's your dream job: http://t.co/6CSSzOuXKv Get onto it!
Only 23 tickets to go.. http://t.co/mbWfT9tMY2
These people must be seriously unwell or up for bank balance-busting refunds.. Why is this taking so long?! #medicare
Sitting in Medicare at lunchtime = waste of life
Thanks for the follow @Strange_Talk - can I just say, Cast Away and Falling in Love are easily the best two tracks of the last 18+ months!
@BenFordham -I've been asked 6 times these last 2 weeks if I'm the guy who was on your show. How strange is that? Hope you're v well, buddy!
@GaryNunn1 Sign me up. It's a total rip off..
@GaryNunn1 Why did SMH not just commission a poll? ;)
Well, *I* thought my last tweet was astute and reasonably hilarious.. Hmm. I'll just go back to tweeting pics of my food and my cat
Just watched a movie that was called "Close Ups Of Ryan Gosling's Face". That's definitely what it should have been called. #pinesschmines
Hurrah! I've made it! RT "@KellyFedor: @yannicklawry pretty sure I just heard your voice on Qld radio. #famous"
@KellyFedor Really? I did an ad recently for Mercedes Benz in BNE. What station? I never thought they'd actually use a Londoner!

Wowzers.. @SITG line-up is pretty amazing. Presets.. Mumford and Sons.. http://t.co/DKwITvHy39 - and that's just for starters!
Hosted George's Day tea party for  @smoothfm953 colleagues. We're unconvinced by scones &amp; cucumber sarnies, but Anzac bics gone down a treat
I hate the term 'boatload'. It's so pejorative. I know I sound like a sensitive lefty, but 'boat carrying asylum seekers' is far cleaner.
Thanks today to @SarrahLeM for the best opinion piece I've read in donkey's...
Dinner. Plus ironic Bieber mug.. http://t.co/cXvVtXndQG
@sfmorris Although what makes it funnier is that I actually owned 'Pocketfull of dreams' on cassette..
@sfmorris Three things I'd forgotten: those two defunct retail outlets and my precocious "comedy value" as a 14 year old..
@KeaganFederici I also remember Rudd making comments in the press about the scourge of fat tradies on our society. It's been a fun 5 years..
Just seems a little bit showbiz and showy for the figurehead of the nation to be doing.. #oldfashioned
Is it me or is it plain weird that the Prime Minister of Australia is officially tweeting her congratulations to a radio dj on giving birth?
@sfmorris I think you'll find it was called the Riverdale Centre. And I never actually bought anything at Mr Byrite. Surely not..
Oh my, @stephcowton I'm pretty sure I saw you just over a month ago and then you went to New Zealand?! Let's do lunch on Weds!! xx

European backpackers walking around barefoot in shopping centres annoys me. I don't know why. But it does.

Off to @TasteofSydney with @GaryNunn1 for opening nite fizz n canapés reception. Dress code is "garden party". What does that even mean?!

@GaryNunn1 Been bugging me for a while. Just heard it yet again on Nova &amp; felt compelled to ask. Your response is sadly devoid of any theory
Something that's been bothering me for a while: "We're going to party like it's 3012 tonight"-I don't understand this simile, @justinbieber?

@darrenmcmullen yup!! - which is why when I finally saw him yesterday (after 2 years of hearing the stories) I got a little snap-happy...
@darrenmcmullen it's fine. I did it yesterday when I spotted the Redfern Pig. Some things deserve more than momentary attention...

Ok, 'Canberrans'... What is Canberra's top nightspot for cocktail indulgence? Suggestions please! #humanbrochure #humanbrochureafterhours
Late to bed and early to rise makes a man... what, exactly? @magpiejay
Listening online to @smoothfm953 while in Canberra for #humanbrochure weekend. @kylieminogue AND culture. Simultaneously! What bliss...
@GaryNunn1 Kylie is totes better...
@bradjparnell I'm in Camberra for humanbrochure weekend. Like it more than last time I was here... can't believe you used to live here tho!
Just bedding down at @diamantcanberra - comfy bed post ouchy night. Zzz http://t.co/O6QCAmVS
@GaryNunn1 Yuk.
First stop: War Memorial, Canberra #humanbrochure http://t.co/eeWNYHus
Branded for our weekend in Canberra. Will keep you posted... #humanbrochure http://t.co/eS4FUGGS
@GaryNunn1 You know how to get a retweet, don't you?! (and yes, I know it's because you appealed to my barely concealed narcissism)
@GaryNunn1 if you want I'm happy to bombard you with insults and we can see if you can plead a blue tick case, you dirty, ginger muppet ;)
@GaryNunn1 in my case: fall victim to some fairly depressing 'trollage', complain to Twitter that I was being defamed and blue tick awarded
@GaryNunn1 cos I am the one and only..
@a_million_beats I stand corrected. Although the sentiment remains unchanged! Thanks for the heads up
90 mins sat in a doctor's surgery in Redfern is a sure-fire way to get sick. Ugh!
@GaryNunn1 @jumpycrawl Errr.. He's grown up a lot in the last 3 years?..
@jumpycrawl @GaryNunn1 The content of your tweets. Yours obviously focus on celebrity, lifestyle and Portia de Rossi..
@GaryNunn1 @jumpycrawl it's hardly a secret.. (ps... shhh! This is supposed to be his 'serious work Twitter account)
hey, @jumpycrawl did you know @TheEllenShow (Ellen deGeneres) is the first person that comes up as "similar to @jumpycrawl " on Twitter? Hmm
I rise from my sick-bed to salute a review of Chris Brown's new album. Well said, Mr Havercroft.. http://t.co/LHJtn5Kb
30 degrees and off go-karting for @GaryNunn1 's 30th birthday celebrations..
#Argo is one of the best films I've ever seen. To think, Mendes sought no credit for his genius &amp; bravery nor received any is kinda humbling
Interesting perspective (not my own): "Five reasons why Baumgartner’s jump was not that great. Unless you work in PR" | http://t.co/6SWVaf0o
@GaryNunn1 @alicrew I probably beat my previous record of 14. Would explain why the nausea has drifted even into Monday..
Hello Hugo! http://t.co/9Q9jAWWZ
@leftofstage they've always been played on nova! Each to thier own tho, mate!
off to see my mate @mr_ed_phillips bbq-ing in the rain for @smoothfm953 ... I'll make a pom if you yet, buddy!
Seriously disgusting, strangely addictive. http://t.co/Ps8VyhYV
Great to hear @therealpresets great new track #promises playing at @nova969 - one of the many reasons @dmgradio is a cut above the rest...
First night nerves... @NotQuiteCabaret opens this eve. Support appreciated, Sydneysiders! http://t.co/DPh27X87 Every Thursday night. Go on!
Would love to see @officialmelb and @nataliebassing do this live on #xfactorau http://t.co/bAP1g5dD
Just registered. Thanks to @officialimogen for the heads up! Register Now! http://t.co/XMjpOfTB via @sharethis
Mel B vs Nat Bass on #xfactorAU - that's the real competition here..
Have to say, loving Rdio..
"Out of hand" would be an understatement... Oops.
Interesting... a VO today for a product I'm not sure I'm ethically happy with. Hmm... Tough one!
So @GuySebastian heard @ronanofficial's Father and Son on the radio en route to X Factor live show? Must've been listening to @smoothfm953
@GaryNunn1 Oops. That wasn't actually intentional... (PS: Clover retweeted *and* thanked me)
Trust yours to be a contrived, witty yet cynical ploy to get Clover to retweet you ;) x
@CloverMoore Try to avoid being sat next to Tony Jones - those out on the outer seats get more time on mic, rumour has it...
Back in Sydney. Amazing holiday in the US but this feels much more real (and like home) God bless Australia!
Smooth FM brekky show up to 3.5% share... and off now to spot bears in Yosemite: life ist gut!
One to follow on this #followfriday, @NotQuiteCabaret - if you haven't already, do it now! #FF
Our GM has instigated "no email Friday". Thus overnight transforming DMG Radio Sydney into an 80s office throwback http://t.co/asspB2Ol

@Dayne_Hudson Happy birthday, big fella. Hope it's a good 'un and the start of the best year ever!!
Hello, Sunday morning..
@AM_092 Only with your hand..
@ronanofficial Hello! smoothfm in Sydney would love to chat to you about X Factor and welcome you back here - when's good?
Chip 'n' PIN must've given a generation of shopkeepers bad necks... highly amused at their extreme efforts to turn away while you key it in
@mr_ed_phillips I've played a few impotent guys. Luckily I'm not a method actor..
Peddling my filthy wares. Again. Acting showreel this time... http://t.co/Fdf2VZad Apologies for bad language. It's my character, not me, ok
Official #city2surf time 1h 15m 14s - a PB for me. Next year I'm going for sub 70!
@mr_ed_phillips @alicrew So, why are we doing this again?! Brrrr
Hey, @mr_ed_phillips and @alicrew is it too early to carb load? May need an extra layer of blubber to guard against Sunday's freezing winds!
@brooksie101 You have got to be kidding! I was really looking forward to it.. Now, not so much!
Just seen #sbs promo for new series of Go Back to Where You Came From. Looks highly compelling. Looking forward to it.

@DirkAnthony Given London's now finally getting its first taste of summer, I'll go with my old haunt overlooking Old Compton St!
Don't like the jaunty front page banner on @dailytelegraph today in Sydney. The guy is not a cartoon character. It's serious. People died.
@stevieshears Oh to be a 32 year old gay guy living it up in Sydney, eh?!
Just ate here: http://t.co/UErUanjs with @GaryNunn1 "Well nice", was his verdict. Mine was similar, if more middle class in its delivery.
See. No one can be bothered... Just left to rot. http://t.co/dInprulu

@DamianNixey You're very welcome, sir. Hope it helps launch your career in this area! All the best - yl
We have the world's worst neighbours. Another party. I don't even know how they can hear each other over this music... Man, I'm getting old.
At @jumpycrawl 's citizenship ceremony. Yes! Another Aussie passport in our Brits-in-Sydney arsenal...
I really want to know who the "similar to" twitterers are for me. And if we are, indeed, in any way similar.
@mr_ed_phillips We may have to monitor channel 10's breakfast show on mute in our studio tomorrow. Rumour has it @LaetitiaElfassy will be on
Jamie's Italian last night was superb. Not sure what I ordered but there was a lot of it, and it were proper tasty innit!
Sorry. I thought The Shire was brilliant. Really well shot, genuinely funny with the right mix of sex appeal and intrigue. #theshire
Whatevs, @GaryNunn1 - speak for yourself re (d) (but thanks for a, b, and c)
Just signed to Sydney's top VO agency... And that'd my final self-indulgent tweet, I promise! Hurrah!

@SarahHarrisNews This question has bugged me for years... As a Pom, I can shed no light alas. We're all just desperate to 'be on TV', maybe!
@thegarethmclean I do it so rarely, though... Unlike a mutual friend of ours who is always peddling his filthy wares online! Eh, @GaryNunn1?
A little self-promotion! Yannick Lawry Voice Reel 2012: http://t.co/bCggfV08 via @youtube
Just found a moth in my muesli. Post mouthful, alas.
@BenFordham He def comes across that way. I don't wanna sound mean, but he should really get those eyes seen to...
I watched We Need To Talk About Kevin last night. Probably the most intensely harrowing yet brilliant film I've ever seen. Recommended...
I am well jel of @BenFordham and his Cookie Monster twitpic
Stuck for ideas on what to do in Sydney this week? Here's a night out with a difference - *WATCH*: http://t.co/jrZbLwCp
@StevenKevinW You're a republican? Who knew?! Hey - that long awaited (maybe that bigs it up a little much) email from me is on its way!
GPs in Australia are the best. They take their time, take you seriously and sort you out. There you go, a big-up to doctors everywhere...
Yes @kateileaver a teapot. I might make the giveaway impossible so I can snaffle it for myself (cue evil laugh...)
Well, @LaetitiaElfassy Did you know @mr_ed_phillips has a genuine #Smoothfm teapot SIGNED by Lionel Richie to give away this week?!

@szabosolicitors @StephaniePowel1 @SydneyLive2GB Doubt I'd be cool enough for Stef. And I'm way too old as well *sniff*
@a_million_beats I like that a "short back 'n' sides" counts as #coiffure!
@StephaniePowel1 @SydneyLive2GB Yep, getting my hair cut especially. Wanna look good for my former colleagues. V important on radio, eh?!
I am super tired. But in dire need of a hair cut. Vanity or bed? What a decision...

Long weekend. At last! Feel like I've earnt this one. Gonna try and drink through this annoying tickle at the back of my throat...
Not done this in a while, so here goes - a #FF for my fave Tweeters: @GaryNunn1 @NotQuiteCabaret @ozdale @mr_ed_phillips and.. @BelleCrawley
Sorry @ImogenFrench... But I'm glad he likes his present. Next bday I'll avoid fake creepy crawlies. Maybe.
@BenFordham Suits you tho, buddy. Amost makes you look younger. Now it sounds like I'm flirting. So I'll shut up now.
Is that tie a little tight, @BenFordham?
@GaryNunn1 France certainly doesn't - I'd dispute that. Let's continue this chat over the Queen's bday weekend (unless you're protesting?)
@GaryNunn1 oh actually, they're even more farked than we are (with no Royal Family to distract them from their fiscal woes) ;)
@GaryNunn1 Of course established republics Iceland and France have been dutifully frugal &amp; have plenty in their coffers for 'the people'...
@GaryNunn1 Please. Spare us the republican dummy-spit just for today! Like it or not, nowt wrong with a little pride in our rich heritage...
Wow, London. Another amazing.display...

I can vouch for him Dazza.. He sounds pretty darn good on the wireless! @darrenmcmullen @DavidCampbell73 @smoothfm953 @smoothfm915
@GaryNunn1 But of course, but of course...
Wowzers, @nataliejpeters that's a bloomin' long strap line at the end of the news, eh? Sounding great this arvo. Hope all's well!
That's nice of you, @GaryNunn1 - you're now one step closer to the signed @michaelbuble CD you asked for...

I could go for a run or I could just eat crisps (sorry, 'chips') and watch these morons on Ready Steady Cook.
@GaryNunn1 Hoped you'd pick up on my patronising tone there. Yeah - book it! Sorry thought I'd already replied. Eurovision at mine on Sun?
@GaryNunn1 Don't be bitter, you've got your own little achievements you celebrate too ;)
Hanging out with @JDonOfficial today @smoothfm953 ... I think @mr_ed_phillips and I persuaded him to join us around 8am tomorrow on the show
Channel 9: maybe we should script Delta, eh? #thevoiceAU
What a day! I'm pooped.. Think I'll go home and relax (to @smoothfm953 no doubt). I'll tone down the work tweets tomorrow, promise!

If you ever need any help writing a killer passive/aggressive email, I'm your man. My 'sent items' is full of 'em today. Aaargh!
#FF @smoothfm953 @smoothfm915 All starts on Monday at 7am. Join us for the launch of Syd and Melb's best new station
Anyway - on to more interesting matters. LINE TO DINE coming up now with @mr_ed_phillips. On Sydney's 95.3. Just 5 days until @smoothfm953!!
Chris made me watch "One Direction: The Story So Far" on TV last night. I protested. Although I secretly quite enjoyed it..
@JasonRosam Next year buddy. Been keeping tabs on you. Sounding brilliant as always. Please come visit soon! Hi to Keith x
Have a weird yet insatiable craving for Sarsaparilla today... Where would I find such a soft drink in Sydney?!
Wowzers... Five years ago since we won that Sony Gold. Time flies, innit! @RobinCrowley01 @jasonrosam
@sfmorris I'd call it a simile, but I take your point.
Some people are dressed up for tonight's gig. Some people are permanently paying tribute... #Prince http://t.co/l7qc3bzS
If he doesn't do Batdance, I'll be demanding my money back #Prince
Is there a @halloates Greatest Hits collection? I think I need it in my life...
We're doing Line to Dine in 10 mins on Sydney's 95.3 @mr_ed_phillips reckons it's easy. It's not. Dinner at Bluefish on offer... 13 59 50
@bradjparnell Tell your mum to listen through Saturday and Sunday for her dedication!

Bravo, @BenFordham - buddy, sensational result for you guys. Huge congrats to you, @StephaniePowel1 and @Dayne_Hudson - lunch soon, please!
@hottoddeetweet @GaryNunn1 I never called you two "slagsFromEssex". It was a "pair of #EssexSlappers". Which is much nicer, don't you fink?
Incredible survey result for DMG Radio Australia. Onwards and upwards, eh!
Are you freaking kidding me? Another ad break - there was less than 2 mins of content there. Aaargh. Am switching to the ABC!
If I guess correctly, I'll watch something less cynically engineered...
Been watching Price is Right for 11 minutes and we're already on ad break no.3. Am playing my own game - how many in the whole half hour?
@GaryNunn1 Did you head to The Beresford post dinner? How d'you pull up today?
@GaryNunn1 Yes,but you really shouldn't have done it in front of my boyfriend. He went to great lengths to out-do you later &amp; it wasn't nice
@GaryNunn1 Of course... Although I don't want you lame-o, slow-coaches cramping my style.
@GaryNunn1 I've forked out my $80 and will be joining in with the 'fun' on June 30..
Time for a green tea and some almonds...
@stevieshears @digitalspybrk @drTonyyy That 's a *terrible* collection of Kylie hits... Ah well. Looking fwd to the acoustic GH collection..
@natapoupard That's awesome! Where did u go to find out that the tweet had made the cut?
@herrdoktorjones Well that's a much better way around. Hope they played Perfect Kiss!
@herrdoktorjones Saw them in Syd in March. Looking old but still sounding amazing. Now, does that remind you of anyone? ;) x
@morrison954 Yes, buddy! Producing brekky with @mr_ed_phillips - exciting stuff. Enjoying Jeremy Kyle still? Hi to Heidi! How is fatherhood?
Sydney's new place to relax arrives May 21... Smooth fm 95.3 (Smooth fm 91.5 in Melbourne). Exciting times in AU radio: http://t.co/xJJ1BoOR
Tweet 1000 is on its way... It's gonna be a good 'un. Stick May 21 in your diary!
Getting very close to my 1000th tweet. Will try to make it interesting and relevant. Unlike the previous 999...
@VodafoneAU_help Really, that's how you *help* customers?! I know there are problems in NSW... I've not been able to use phone in 36hrs!!
@VodafoneAU_help Live in Waterloo NSW, Work in Pyrmont NSW. Terrible sevice for MONTHS in both areas. Suggestions? Really over it...
Wow, @Vodafone_AU - your 'guaranteed' network really is a steaming pile of dung. A full 24 hrs offline today... See ya!
Superstitions are stupid. This one is really stupid.. http://t.co/a11i9h2s Happy 1st of the month, innit!
Being ribbed by @mr_ed_phillips and @alicrew for leaving our brekky show lunch on Friday to go and feed my mate's cat.. Sydney's 95.3fm
The More Music Breakfast Show is under way with @mr_ed_phillips. Syd Comedy fest tix to give away and dinner at Bonfire Brazilian Grill..
"101 More Housework Songs"... Really?! Anyone shelling out cash for this compilation should be lobotomised. http://t.co/7ADKPM2j
@virginia03 V! Are you in Sydney? Can we grab coffee sometime. Would love to see ya!
@KKeneally Too true. Am a Redfern resident and am proud to be! I'm sure @benfordham would happily be poster boy for any counter-argument...
@brooksie101 Oh yes. Tempted to go and see it again next week. *That* good!!
Joss Whedon has done an amazing job with The Avengers. Loved it... Far better than the damp squib that was Firefly.
@a_million_beats I don't like him or his music! But osmosis has prevailed...
So, is it ok to like Chris Brown these days or what? Feel guilty each time I catch myself humming along to his disposable choonage...
@fosterthepeople I'm waiting for that final moment you say the words that I can't say
@BenFordham Got it. Ta!
So, you know The Voice, right? What happens after these blind auditions?
Having won at 2 up, I now think it's the best thing ever. Here's to midweek public holidays!
Chris's "secret recipe" Anzac biscuits... http://t.co/XVK2yAA7
I have never played "2 up" in my 4 years here in Australia. I want to rectify this tomorrow. Any venue suggestions?
@creatiques Hey - what's up?
Thanks to @Dayne_Hudson my new working hours won't see me turning into a fat heap. Cheers buddy - protein shake 'smashed' and porridge ahoy!
@StevenKevinW Hey. How do? Been meaning to write you for a while. Would you mind dropping me your postal addy? Hope all's well in Blighty!

@LaetitiaElfassy Tu vas voter demain?
Combination of sleep and blue(ish) skies does wonders, y'know...
@tashlee I hear ya... And I live right next to Maccas on McEvoy/Botany. Harder and harder to resist with these early starts..
@GaryNunn1 I am working on making this happen... See you for sing-a-long-a-Sondheim tomoz, innit.
I FREAKIN' HATE HOUSE HUNTING.
@rodgerthornhill You're obviously not listening, buddy - and that's ur prerogative.. Hope you find a station that ticks all ur boxes soon!
@brooksie101 I realise I'm probably shifting far too much responsibility for my life onto your shoulders!
@brooksie101 What is with this weather?! Am I likely to get soaked again on my ride into work at 5am tomorrow? Should I just book a taxi?!
Ugh. And now back on the bike in the pouring rain for an appointment in Erskineville. (Underpants reinstated)
Soaked both to and from work today. On the plus side, had to go commando due to sodden underwear. Highly empowering stuff...
Just finished Dexter Season 5: V.G.
Worst timing for bike ride action... http://t.co/WJhOAtCG
Going to see The Artist/Prince on May 11. Kinda excited!
Wow @rodgerthornhill so much hate in your twit feed! We have heaps of spare time during our 'dullsville' show if you're in need of a hug..
The Big Banana: "not that big..." http://t.co/wzITkKtf
Wow... @benfordham The residents of Artarmon must be loving you encouraging that prepubescent carcophany outside their homes!
@Smallzy Loved that Olly Murs calls listener moment..."Hi, it's Olly Murs here". Listener: "Oh my God! Why?!" Awesome show this eve. As ever
"I can't believe he's called us Dumb and Dumber. I've got eight GCSEs!" #TOWIE
@virginia03 Hello you! Long time no see/speak..How the devil are you? Am back at DMG these days working with the delectable @mr_ed_phillips!
Um, I think he's about 6'1" / 6'2" (usually wears dark clothing) #nowplaying
@withtwoteas That is some fairly prolific tweeting you're doing there! Wassup? How are tricks?
A woman faints at the top of the harbour bridge? I'd finally plucked up the courage to give it a go myself. Might put that on hold for now..
@harleemcleod Still sounding good tho, matey! Ever the pro Harley. Hope he gets back in sync (and you get some sleep) soon.
@Radio2UE It's 'carcass', fyi. Sorry to be pedantic! But as fellow radio person I know it all matters..
@ImogenFrench Welcome to Twitter (and HB2U)
In the name of equality, I'd like clothes shops to put menswear on the ground floor once in a while. S'only fair.
Just met two lovely Scottish ladies at the Immigration Museum in Melbourne. They met on a ship as orphans 50 years ago. Great story.
Awesome week on 95.3 brekky show! Kinda tired, though. Melbourne, it's your job to wake me up...
@StephenCena @CrownStreetDog Yeah - v sad, eh? I saw him most days on my way to work.
I am *so* bad with voicemail. "You have 24 new voice messages". Really? Suppose I should start listening and preparing my apologies...
@sethdarby At 6.40am? Think I'd rather have a few extra minutes' sleep...
Hi @brooksie101 - is it true that La Nina weather pattern has now left Australia? Late summer, perchance?!
Only two more to go... (sad face) http://t.co/Fd94N1XD-
My metabolism's all outta whack with these new hours (yes, already..) When to eat? When to sleep? What a minefield..
Hunger Games at the Flicks tonight. Just to round off a pretty bang-on weekend!
First trip to an Aussie Ikea. Living the Sunday arvo dream.
That was a great lie-in. Last one of those for a while. 4am starts from tomorrow... Ouchy!
Awesome night of @notquitecabaret - can't believe we've only 2 to go this season! Best bunch of people evah, innit and humblingly talented..
These voucher sites are getting ridiculous. "2 hours of free electrician work", "50% off tile grouting". Really? All a tad niche methinks..
The "Lucky Leprichaun" came to 95.3 today... He made me have his picture taken with him. Happy Paddy's Day in advance! http://t.co/3zaXqP4w
Does anyone still ever do #FF ... In any case, I recommend: @NotQuiteCabaret @SydneyLive2GB and @tenbreakfast
@StephenCena Nothing really. I kinda like the name. It is, you'd have to admit, not very similar to "Yannick"
Have decided, after 3 weeks, to correct the guy sitting opposite me at work who keeps calling me 'Andrew'
@leobenedictus Indeed! Highly readable, too. I look forward to your next offering, buddy..
In a bonza mood today... Maybe it's the triple-shot flat white? Either way, endorphins a go-go!
@brooksie101 Very true! So that must mean this lot are like a dodgy cask of #goon! In truth, they're talented. Just so scarily young!!!
@AndrewJaffrey Sounds about right... It's not that they're doing a bad job either.. But at 33, I feel positively ancient!
All the newsreaders on ABC News 24 tonight are about 16... At a push!
Good on the dog. I'd do the same in its position... http://t.co/4YkSEpho
@leobenedictus Enjoyed The Afterparty. Books take a while to cause any real stir down under, alas.. Is the future of literature interactive?
Anyone else read #afterpartybook ? Right near the end now and can't decide if it's sheer genius or gimmicky pap...
Opening night of @notquitecabaret went off with a bang ce soir... Book ur tickets for remaining 4 shows - http://t.co/DPh6Fx91
After having my house flood for the 3rd time this year, I'm pining for a good British summer (or, at least, a half-decent drainage system)
@scottjsroberts Wowzers. That means they haven't done a proper clean at 'The Towers' in almost 5 years!!
I. Am. Cool. Innit! http://t.co/kfpPvHLQ
New Order this evening. What a week it's been...
@DamoManUtd @NotQuiteCabaret Yes - just give your name and the reference 2Gb should have emailed you? See u thurs!
@sfmorris I take no blame for that. Recently heard a couple of Tanita Tikaram tracks on the radio and thought of you for some reason...
Am mildly obsessed with @sbspopasia This is my third Sunday in a row where I'm up early and watching...
Room at the top?... Melbourne's 91.5 FM http://t.co/5jiJ6r28
Are @nova969 really playing Marky Mark and The Funky Bunch?! Awesome!
Great chat yesterday with @BenFordham on @2GB873 about @NotQuiteCabaret which starts on 8 March. Book *your* ticket - http://t.co/DPh6Fx91
@SuperiorAdrian Mate - all good, ta! Thanks for the wishes. Hope you're well n happy
@withtwoteas whateva, sista... Welcome to Twitter. We all just bark into the ether but remain indifferent as to if anyone's even listening!
So apparently drinking out of refilled water bottles is a big no no... Great. Yet more stuff for me to become paranoid about.
At Town Hall for Mike's citizenship ceremony. I wonder what colour choker @clovermoore will be wearing today? Aussie, Aussie, Aussie...
Dinner party menu complete. I'm more excited about the dips than anything else...
Like the Short+Sweet page to help me win 2x tickets to the Gala Finals: http://t.co/9XzXf19x
Wisdom tooth hurts. Can see weird mole on arm. Been using mobile phone too much... Hope my GP is ready for an epic display of hypochondria
@EyeDearMan V kind of you to drop me a note. Much appreciated! I do miss the the guys but I know the show in 2012 is gonna be even better!
Are the cockatoos in Victoria Park on crack, or what? The noise is deafening and one just flew past and left a 'present' on my backpack...
Just completed first lesson of my Mandarin course. Am obviously a natural.. Step one towards new career as Australasian Ambassador complete!
First my lunch date cancels on me, then my dinner date. Man, I'm hungry... (and a friendless loser, apparently)
I've updated LinkedIn profile which suggests I'm clever & successful when, in fact, I'm sat unwashed in my boxers in my kitchen drinking tea
@StevenKevinW I have tweeted under 900 times in 3 years. You've managed just shy of 400 in a few short months.. Do I smell an emerging vice?
My chilli con carne is probably the world's best. Just sayin'...
I have a casting for a Nescafe ad tomorrow. Maybe I'm this generation's Anthony Stewart Head... (look it up, tweeps!)
Loving every single free track download on the UK iTunes store so far this year... Diagram 8 especially good!
Watching people get it on to Hanson's MmmBop. In 2012. With no sense of irony. Weird.
@MyMateDobbo Aw mate - thanks! Look forward to catching up when you're next on @BenFordham 's couch in the Redfern 'hood!
@ShockJockCoach Will that involve listening to copious amounts of talkback radio? Enjoy your tweets very much, buddy!
@Alan_Belford Cheers buddy - loved working here too... Will miss it.
@1adamm1 Yep, me & Singo have embarked on a top secret joint venture! I wish... Nope - am going it alone in radio world. Take it easy, buddy
@ivan_oakes Nope *gulps* - a sole trader! Cheers for listening and all the support. Take it easy, buddy
@StephenCena Cheers Stephen! Look forward to hearing you muscle your way in with the talkback greats... keep at it!
Am no longer an employee...
@British_Airways An apology is great. Halfway appropriate compensation would really help me believe BA truly means they're sorry!
In studio with @BenFordham for a final fling before undertaking new projects next week. What a ride.. Thanks for everything @SydneyLive2GB x
Flew SYD-LHR and back with @British_Airways In-flight entertainment was broken both ways. Just offered $70 voucher as compensation. Rubbish!
I have never known drivers hesitate so much at a green frikkin' light as they do in Sydney... JUST GO!!!
Holiday not even over yet. Made the mistake of checking emails. Over 2500 to process upon my return... Joy!
Hello Bangkok. Seems you're sweaty, and full of pissed-up Brits being awful. May as well try to fit in...
I keep referring to the London Eye as the "Millennium Wheel". It seems to annoy people. All the more reason to continue doing it...
Sod present-buying. Gonna go for drinks @ The Champion, Wells St by Oxford Circus tube from 4pm. Come join me when it all gets too much.
Christmas shopping is doing my knockers in! Panic buying has just hit Central London. I don't hold out much hope for my haul this year...
I frikkin' love Australia
On the rampage... Regret may abound....

OH NO!! @BenFordham and @SydneyLive2GB - my mum has LOST ALL of my Letters Home from 2011. What to do....?
Kevin Spacey: a very shouty and camp Richard III. Entertaining tho...
The year's drawing to a close, but the news rolls on... The week that was: http://t.co/JBJSmI2J @BenFordham @SydneyLive2GB
Keep waking up with 'Uncle John From Jamaica' going round my head. Why? http://t.co/iDHkfCiA
A rare night of leaving work before 8pm... To celebrate I'm at the gym. Bonza!
I have a question for research purposes... @SydneyLive2GB What were *YOUR* favourite moments of 2011?
What's it feel like to be middle-aged, @BenFordham ? HB2U buddy!
Turned out nice again.. http://t.co/QwDdcdIp
@syd_jazz Sure thing - am off til Tues but shoot thru your email and I'll send it to you.
Lawn bowls in the rain at Bronte? Sounds like fun...
How's the new Twitter addiction, @StephaniePowel1 ?
That's right, @StephenCena - @ShockJockCoach @BenFordham and I are radio's unholy trinity... Shh.
Commonwealth Bank internet banking has been down for 2 days. Only slightly annoying...
Justified and Ancient... kinda how I'm feeling today! Thanks for the well-wishing. It helps. http://t.co/kKWDO4oo
Yeah. Not convinced by this new Natalie Bassingthwaite offering complete with early 90s rap interlude. Bizarre.
Cheers! http://t.co/3SqmMBBP
Wine tour in The Hunter with Wendy. It's 9.30am and the bubbles are flowing...

Sydney Live's week that was... the good, the bad and, in parts, the ugly... http://t.co/9yO9h0Uu @BenFordham @2GB873 @SydneyLive2GB
I am not built for resolving plumbing disasters but am stepping up to this stinky challenge...
Totally sucked in by The Hunger Games trilogy..
Ok, @JackieMoshtaghi and @StevenKevinW - here you go. You should know I only ever tell it like it is! http://t.co/EcgM29E9
Zut alors!
Went diving on the GBR today. Am now listening to a live band play Paul Kelly classics while I drink VB. Surely citizenship's a formality?
Ok. Just so you know.. "Chance of showers" in Cairns means "black foreboding clouds and epic torrential rain all day". Apparently.
Well, it was when I posted that tweet. Sky looking ominous. Again. I look hot in my wetsuit which almost makes up for it...
Going diving on the reef today. Finally the sun is shining in Far North Queensland. Hooray.
@LeighHolmwood I'm in Cairns. Get me out of here... You're near Surfer's again soon I presume?
Every bar I go to in Queensland smells like a deep fat fryer...
BBC News - Richard Branson dedicates Virgin Galactic spaceport http://t.co/adbDASZO ... I WANNA GO!!!!
I am already in holiday mode. Despite the forecast for Cairns. PMA... check!
@MICHDP Half English, half Frog!
Allez les bleus!
Fingers crossed for tonight's #ACRAs
@HeyBaylen You forget... I am British. I thus have the right to judge and look down my nose at everyone else without fear of reproach.
@HeyBaylen 'You people'?! Sorry, how long have you been squatting over there? Surely you're now one of us/them now!
Seeing Don Giovanni tonight at The Opera House. Just re-read the synopsis. Seems a tad far-fetched if you ask me...
3am. Eternal.
Who is Cody Simpson? He seems to be trending everywhere and I have no idea who this kid is! An inevitable symptom of ageing, no doubt...
The Daily Mash - L'Oreal 'despises all women equally' http://t.co/XgHAcQNH  Take heed, ye vain...!
I know they've been around for years, but I still think people wandering around talking on hands-free kits tend to look like total nutjobs.
Drop It Like It's Hot! Whoa, this takes me back @benwood01
It always seems like a good idea booking a personal training session for 9am on a Saturday.. until Saturday morning rolls around...
2GB Media Player - Yannick's Letter Home To Mum - 23 September 2011 http://t.co/EdSWHCRP via @addthis
On the flip side, Boca in Darlinghurst was awesome. Great food, good wine and company was bearable too... @gray_price ;) Scoupons rock!
Voucher fail! @PianoRoomSydney -bouncer v aggressive and kicked us out at 10pm. Food n drink pretty average, staff unbelievably rude. Avoid!
Just a regular Tuesday night in my 'hood...
Thrashed at squash by a guy who barely broke a sweat. Then my bike chain falls off in front of housing association kids who hurl abuse at me
Embracing 30-something-dom by playing squash lots (and trying not to have an on-court coronary)

Just about to sink a Berrocca Colada. And Chris is having a Lagerita. Who will feel worse in the morning?
Sydney Live - the week that was... http://t.co/bHcWbBb @SydneyLive2GB @2GB873 @BenFordham
@thegarethmclean Sounds a lot better than what's often on radio over here at that time of day.. Redneck propoganda while-u-eat. Be thankful!
@kevmacisaac Anyway - hopefully it's now under control. Gonna come see NQC next week I reckon so hope to catch you after!
@kevmacisaac You have been seriously hacked, old buddy! Had &gt; 10 messages from you along the lines of "OMG check out this link ROFL!!!"
Honesty's a challenge at the best of times. When filling out a 'food diary', it's nigh-on impossible..
Theatre, Food n Booze!... Not Quite Cabaret - Thursdays 'til sept 29th 8pm http://t.co/KX7lAPD @ Exchange Hotel Beattie St, Balmain.
Engaged?
Societé on Danks St is pretty amazing. The Big Breakfast is almost too big...
@UziRash Don't work there, buddy. If I did,I would have! Have a good weekend.
I think I quite like this @SLiDEFOX8 programme. A good re-working of Skins but would love more shots of Brissie & a uniquely Aus storyline..
@nova969 Please God stop this terrible, terrible phone-in on Giving Up Your Baby For Adoption. Totally insincere and inappropriate!!!
Must say, enjoying the brekky 'best of' moments on @nova969 today. Will miss ya, @MerrickWatts. All the best, buddy
Voucher sites... thoughts/experiences?
I always pick The Only Way Is Essex over #qanda
Dreamcatcher may well be the worst film I've ever seen...

Flight Experience, Darling Harbour. Wouldn't make a great pilot, but much fun... http://t.co/QK66kIM
@StevenKevinW Was running for a good cause but fundraising was hard as pretty much everyone I know was running! Hope all's good in Brum!

City to Surf. How much do I wish I hadn't bothered with it this year? 14k in the driving rain. Can't wait!
Olympic ring looted... http://t.co/zn5nchW
Saw Othello last night @TapGallerySYD. Very impressive. Great cast... even if Iago was a bit 'Ian Beale' from EastEnders. Recommended!
@craigie_b reliving your yoof, are you? Old episodes of Quantum Leap next?! See you in December, old chap. Hope you're keeping well!
Forgot to pack underpants in my gym bag today so have the choice of going to work commando or wearing sweaty gym shorts under my jeans. TMI?
I wonder whether in 99 years anyone will be interested to know that I travelled to work by bike today? #AusCensus
@jasonrosam - Jason! How are you? Can we do a cross with you from Australia at around 6:40am your time? No worries if not, but let me know!x
What on Earth is going on in London? So good of Dave and Boris to cut their holidays short to deal with it all...
@EmsNorthy would love to see touch too! Call me when you get here.. Will send you number in a direct message! X
Quite enjoying this Foster the People album, actually...
Et tu, Clover Moore?
Just seen the new Sneaky Sound System video clip for We Love. Trés amusant...
Not yet... @MoneyNewsShow ..as soon as this contract ends, I'll be long gone! #vodafone
The Only Way Is Essex. I know it's awful but I'm hooked. This speaks volumes regarding the state of (a) Australian TV and (b) my sad life...
Being bullied into going for a run. Despite 3 weeks off the grog, I don't feel any more up for it...
Cooked a stir fry this morning for lunch later. Went to the gym and left it in my locker with my work clothes. Now I smell like a chip shop.
Thanks for the dead rat, Bruce. Wonderful start to my morning, buddy.
Yeah, wasn't much of a fan of Bridesmaids.
Got out of the cab, then the cabbie asks Kate, "is he Yannick off the radio?" A nod. "He's very quiet. Normally they can't shut him up"...
@PaolaBagnall It's a cracker! So glad you liked it. Very moving and inspiring too x
@creatiques Of course I do! Still listening to the 'dar? Hope all's good!
Just finished To Kill A Mockingbird. Ashamed to say it was my first time. One question... It's the sheriff who kills Bob Ewell, right?
@robbielockie Yeah all is good! Can't believe I've been here for 3 years now! Back at xmas for a visit! How's you?
Hello, Samsung Galaxy S II... I think I love you...
@juicylucyjones Sorry for delayed response - who was my mate you were with??!
I spy with my little eye some big changes and exciting times ahead!
Wow - what a brilliant Q and A! Bless you, Penny Wong #qanda
Thank you Virgin Australia for picking up the pieces! You are saviours of the skies...
6 months smoke free - just sayin'
Thanks again, Tiger. Now I am stranded in Brisbane... Officially the worst airline in the world!
@tobyboon True. Back over xmas though. Would love to see you pair whilst we're there. Saw Altian in Bondi last week. He sends his regards..
Just rocked up at a bar in Brizzie's West End. I'm sober as. Everyone else here is clearly off their nut(s). I dunno... Queenslanders, eh?!
Show over. Cycled home. Fed cats. Had shower. In cab to airport. Brisvegas I'M READY FOR YA
@sethdarby Yes, we're both trend-setters for a generation... What's new? Get my vmail? Let's do Redfern coffee/breaky one morning...
Just found out I share a birthday with Petula Clark. Something new every day, as they say...
John Street's newest resident and, as yet, sans moniker... http://yfrog.com/h8onzonj
@trevorlong ... bit of a drab, fence-sitting assessment of the show. I would have expected a little more insight from Nick (and the BBC)!
Think we looked pretty hot at the 60s-themed Hairspray premiere.. http://yfrog.com/h3cgzxrmj
Looking forward to meeting some of the people who volunteered for #gobackSBS on @BenFordham 's Sydney Live 3-6 on @2GB873 from 3pm TODAY.
Hey Southern Hemmie Homies: the days are getting longer from hereon in!
This #gobackSBS is pretty amazing tv. First up, good on the participants. Not sure I'd have volunteered for this..
Dear Network Video, Waterloo. $1.95 rental on Tuesdays means you should give me back 5c from 2 bucks. And not make me feel bad about it!
@mattjwgill Yep - v depressing. Ocean acidification may be the biggest issue to adversely affect the planet & yet it gets v little coverage
Apparently sleeping on your front is bad for your spine. Can someone with any medical authority confirm or deny this please? G'night.. zzz
Cycled to Sydney Park. Lots of dogs using my bike as a urinal. Also lots of weird dog names here... Bella and Edward for two bulldogs. Apt.
Bronte is the best, innit
Just fired my accountant. Feel like a proper grown-up! Did the Alan Sugar finger point and everything...
@Oldmatelordy a mate of mine has some mini-farm in orchard hills so I'm driving over this wkend. You can tell I'm a city boy thru and thru!
@dlt020971 cheers buddy - good news!
@Oldmatelordy cheers buddy - this is good news!
If I drive the M4 from Sydney to Penrith, how much would I expect to pay in tolls? (Sounds like a high school maths problem, I know)...
@sfmorris I really can't imagine you using a sieve. Have you been baking? My, how life has changed!
Fajitas: great on the way in...
Bruce is back! Where have you been, mate?! http://yfrog.com/ehw1svgj
My aunt is super-talented & has just had a book published on "hypno birthing". Check it out here: http://bit.ly/j2KIvE Good on ya, Aunty P!
You can judge me all you like, but I'm kinda looking forward to a bit of @kylieminogue action tonight...
Yes, @BenFordham - I'm deadly serious! You'll see the posters round your way soon enough. I called him Bruce as a tribute to Aus..
Not enjoying this missing pet drama. Plus I feel like a tool posting 'Lost Cat' posters all over town. Where are you, Bruce?!
I need to hang out with more Canadians
Had the best meal ever last night at Angelo's On The Bay in Cabarita. Still feel stuffed (in a good way!) http://bit.ly/mxNKHG Yumbo!
At last - another letter home! What a week... http://bit.ly/khwr1a @BenFordham @2GB873
How do I check if my PC soundcard is capable of recording from the 'stereo mix' output (ie from online/youtube into Audition/Audacity)?
Is it June already? Is it Wednesday today? Where does it all go, eh?
The Sydney Live office smells of fish... @DayneHudson
What's the point of freakin Foxtel if it cuts out every time it rains?! Grr.
@ECamaldulensis I reckon you're right... We're pretty unpredictable with our inconsistent dialects... Boo to the Maroons, btw..
Ok.. @ECamaldulensis so what you're telling me is that it's a purer pronunciation?! Let's wager this thing old pal, old friend!
@kascribe this is true: go the blues!
@gongboy2000 too true (although, I have never previously considered myself a 'rah rah'..)
@gongboy2000 thank you! I was opening up a dialogue and encourage the debate... We south Londoners are inquisitive (and snobby..m)
@kascribe hmm... The 'mah' bit I have no problem with! :)
@gongboy2000 but it's the same language... Why, do you pronounce it Lie-ses-ter like the yanks? I know we're on the same page :)
Australians: I want to understand you better... Please explain to me your odd pronunciation of the word 'maroon'. Ps. Go the blues.
I can never find any touristy giftage bearing my name. This makes me sad. Oh to have a more mainstream moniker...
Sydney Live, 3-6pm today... Join us! @benfordham @2GB873 http://twaud.io/r6Vw
I really despise Robert Pattinson - this appearance of his on Graham Norton confirms it.
Ok, @CalvinHarris : I'm a huge fan, but I'm still not convinced by Bounce. Is it just a case of exposure? I *really* want to like it! Hmm.
Let's hope it was all a false alarm: http://bit.ly/jBu8jX See you next week... j'espère @2GB873 @BenFordham
Maybe my last ever Letter Home tonight on 2GB 873AM. 5.45pm if you wanna check out the (last ever) week that was... @2GB873 @BenFordham
Flights home (via Thailand) for Christmas almost booked. Only decision left to make is whether to fly on 16 Dec or earlier...
What is with Spar in Alexandria? It's like a supermarket in the Eastern bloc with exorbitant prices and empty shelves...
Oh no. How did that happen?
Stop putting spaces between words and punctuation! Please.
Denmark for #Eurovision champions, methinks... Despite the controversy, it's def the best entry innit.
I am massively dehydrated...
Looking forward to @cutcopy tonight!
Excuse the cynisism, but do The Potbelleez (@thepotbelleez) now only record music they know will be used in radio and tv promos?!
Should I bother getting to learn more about Linkedin? I check it once every 3 months tops...
Starting to learn about Chuck Norris and his complete oeuvre...
What a week that was... http://bit.ly/msYDbI @2GB873
Not enjoying people stomping round my house making comments about it. These open inspections suck. You're all too feral to live here!
Where can I find, rent or borrow a trolley for lifting heavy things like a fridge?
Buying sofas, dining chairs and new beds. Am I a 30something?
Joined by @JuliaGillard on the show today. Sydney Live with @BenFordham on @2GB873 from 3pm.
I make a mean thai green curry. Just sayin'.
@Smallzy I too realised this last week - Feel your pain, brother...
Just caught @Ross_Greenwood on the ABC's Hungry Beast doing a 'Hip Hop Finance Report'. Love the head gear, buddy!
@Smallzy Buddy, have I just heard you back on Nova? Good on ya!
'Love is in the heir': Daily Tele, you've excelled yourselves...
@mejohnlawley Totally. Harry and Pippa, sitting in a tree...
@BenFordham right. I'm due an introduction to the big kahuna, methinks. Safe home, buddy!
London looks blissfully grey...
@bradjparnell They're your future kings n queens... You loves it! X
Fearne Cotton and Edith Bowman? What's all this about?
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand...
So glad ABC1 are taking the BBC's commentary. Huw - you sound great, sir!
My mum's in a pub hanging out with @BenFordham and Kate's just arrived at the church looking a million dollars. All choked up! #royalwedding
This is my no 1 bit of Kate n Will tat, however. Currently retailing at around $7k on ebay, apparently... http://twitpic.com/4qh8yg
Definitely in my top 3 'Kate and Will memorabilia' items... http://twitpic.com/4qh80i
@SimpsonMatt Maybe for the older and more discerning generation...
Do the At The Movies twosome hate eachother? Makes for such entertaining viewing in any case...
is scre4ming this evening...
Have been lacking inspiration for informative/entertaining tweets or status updates. Must try harder...
I FREAKIN' LOVE ROAST POTATO FLAVOURED CRISPS!
People are strange!
Fewer and fewer people seem to appreciate the distinction between 'less' and 'fewer'. Shame, that.
I pride myself on exceptional grammar & spelling in tweets... Obviously, I meant 'think'..
Anyone else thing Jessie J's Price Tag sounds more than a little like Leona Lewis's Better In Time? Uncanny, eh?
Blackberry Curve: your days are numbered. On April 26 you will be ritually cremated and replaced without remorse or ceremony. Never again...
Featherdale Wildlife Park rocks. Even when you're in your 30s and childless!
Drink. Colleagues. Truth. Never mix.

Sydneysiders: It may be April but it's still over 23 degrees outside. Tights, scarves and thick overcoats are not necessary, agreed?
Agent Sumo: 24 Hours #nowplaying Get in!

Duets with Katy Perry and now David Guetta... Snoop Dogg, who are you?!
@Skippykhan thanks for that parlotones tip!
Bored of stir-fry
Noted @BenFordham: Will source chill pills tomorrow for team & audience tomorrow. Ps.Am at a bar where they serve cocktail called 'Old Mate'
Worst song of all time, @BenFordham ? Hmm - maybe 'Come on Eileen' or Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' from Titanic?
Autumn / Spring
Canada's national anthem is pretty terrible, isn't it?

Am entertaining parents (not mine). Have chosen The Rocks. On St Patrick's day. They'll certainly leave with *an* impression of Sydney..
New Panic at the Disco album. Joy! http://bit.ly/fJvxgR
Over it.
Big fan of my two amazing Godchildren!
Americans on the beach. That's all I can hear right now. That and the overuse of the word 'neat'.
Am so chuffing pleased it's the weekend #winning
Week in Review - here's the week that was (according to me!) http://bit.ly/ekNwmF @2GB873 @BenFordham
Ok. Buying Kylie tickets for Sydney on June 8 today. Boredom cured!
Maybe I just need to catch up on sleep instead... G'night.
Well, @virginia03 Friday arvos around 5.45 are when I do my 'Week in Review' and that certainly does help keep @BenFordham in check :)
Maybe I just need to download some good new music. But what? Yawn.
@virginia03 Man, you're gonna be addicted soon. After my first ebay sale I almost started stealing stuff to sell on just for the buzz!!!
Ok. I need something to look forward to.
Um, work calls on my day in lieu will always be ignored along with any ensuing voicemail messages! Tsk.
Toy box, Toy box, Toy box!
Anyone noticed that since the start of 2011, people seem much less obsessed with social media - #fb & #twitter? I wonder why? Thoughts?
@marshamusic Not just for French speakers / Not just for a French-speaking audience xx
Totally understand the delay now. This driver has a massive aversion to the accelerator pedal and a strong connection with the brake...
Come on 501 bus, been waiting for 30 mins now. Shoulda, woulda, coulda walked...
Ouch n frikkin ouch...
Just finished reading Into The Wild.. maybe I'm a little on the fragile side but that was intensely inspiring stuff!
@marshamusic Yo. You popped up in a dream of mine over the weekend! How's tricks in Toronto? Xx
Very happy about going to see Cut Copy on May 12!
My cuss level on twitter is 100% clean! What's yours? http://theoatmeal.com/quizzes/twitter_cuss via @oatmeal

The Farmer Wants... To stop barking up the wrong tree?!?!
@juicylucyjones nah - it's march 8th xx
Just downloaded Chris Brown's 'Yeah 3X' which, I think, officially makes me a 13-year old girl.
Heard Sydney Live with @BenFordham on @2GB873 recently? Here's a taster - http://bit.ly/gjs4vE
A great philosopher once said: naughty, naughty, very naughty...

Just. Brilliant. Radio. NSW political adversaries prove you're never too old to point the finger.. http://bit.ly/h5ChJK @BenFordham @2GB873
Um, this Ben Elton show on Channel 9 isn't getting many laughs in our house (or with the studio audience, it seems...)

Sydney's hottest ever week. Australia's biggest ever cyclone. This is a land of seriously scary superlatives.
Can't remember what happened last week? Here's a reminder: "Dear Mum" from @2GB873: http://bit.ly/hR6FaL Sydney Live 3-6 with @BenFordham
A cab to and from work today... If only I haf the means to make this a daily extravagance.

I've waited all my life for this... http://yfrog.com/h78tmkj
I, for one, have never heard of the person named (actual) Australian of the Year.. But I guess I'm still just a glorified backpacker.
Compere to  punter: 'Where did you meet your girfriend?' Punter: 'Through a friend' Compere: 'Is that friend called The Internet?' Genius!

@juicylucyjones yeah go on, I'll 'ave a ff off ya if you're offerin :)
Goodbye 55-hour week, hello weekend!
So Aussie Salt and Vinegar 'chips' come in pink packets, not blue. It's taken me nearly 3 years to realise this...
My suggestions, innit: #ff @2GB873 @BenFordham @jamesbeckingham @virginia03 @Simonique That'll do. Have a good weekend!
Hey #Oprah! Love your alternative pronunciation of 'Melbourne'. You kinda spruced up @JuliaGillard 's name & made her sound French.. Bravo!

Capital FM UK? Sounds good so far! Watch out, Australia the centralisation of your fiercely local radio and tv content is close at hand...
Not a fan of having to prepare two tax returns a year. Plus uk accountants are stupidly expensive with regard to their Aussie counterparts!
What an interesting parade of bogan tattoos at Coogee beach today. My favourite? 'Tit lover' in calligraphy across someone's neck.
@HeidiTiltins Happy New Year to you and Jason. Hope Vegas starts the year off for you both with a bang!
Redfern looking pretty in the summer sun. Will miss the Great Ocean Road though...

Highly amused by the dirty looks I get whenever I whip out my copy of "Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World" on Sydney public transport
@LeighHolmwood Typical whingeing pom... Are you staying in the Versace hotel? If so, that ought to make up for it :)
Angus and Julia Stone: Australia's answer to the UK's Same Difference? #ARIAs
A decade later than everyone else with ears, I finally get the hype around Kings of Leon
True Blood season 3 finale = total cack.

Getting to grips with iTunes Ping and downloading Ou Est Le Swimming Pool album. #iamstillmusicallyrelevant

Noodle markets. Fun, fun, fun in my tum, tum, tum.
I'm amazed at being able to check in *and* board a flight using only my Blackberry. Feel like I live in The Future, innit.
Yes, that really is Carrie Fisher sitting in the studio next to mine...
Need to book flights to Sunny Coast, Auckland, Adelaide and Melbourne in the next week or so. Expensive months methinks...
This is the 80s and we're down with the ladies... http://yfrog.com/n422nhj
I've tweeted this before, and I'll tweet it again: I f@!*ing hate Sydney taxi drivers. You're all shit.
Blackberry: I'm fast getting tired of you. Apparently my twitter and fb username/password combo is incorrect. However, I beg to differ...
New G'day UK pod here: http://bit.ly/bApISx #2GB #bbmlive
Ate bowl of Cheerios an hour ago. Now hungrier than I would be if I hadn't bothered. Plus they tasted proper bland.
is spending way too much time in the shire (hobbit jokes? Go for your life!)
Have decided to pitch new show to Ch9: The Backpacker Wants a Visa
Farmer wants a wife... Best cliffhanger I've ever seen on Aussie tv. Will she say yes? Oh dear...
I don't understand Bear Grylls' motivation.
I'd like Roger to win one more, then quit... C'mon, buddy. You just have to believe (and put in some hard graft)
@producerjoe If you like the Hurts singles, you'll probably (like I was) be disappointed by the album... Shame!
At Opera Bar. Carrying my grocery shop in a trusty Aldi bag. Interesting juxtaposition... http://twitpic.com/2na1vo
Life ist gut... http://twitpic.com/2n8hhd
Note to self: do not liberally apply Vicks Vaporub before stepping out in public.
@virginia03 You're in Sydders?? Can we do coffee whenever you have a window?!
Massively disappointed with this #Hurts album. It's all very Spandau Ballet, and not in a good way (if there were a good way)
@scottdools no, soccer am is a GREAT show!
@JasonRosam I agree buddy. She must have one hell of a publicist. Wish she'd F off and leave the world alone!
Ok, House Party Nazi. I'm only drinking your vodka 'cos someone who wasn't me drank all of mine.
@Popjustice Am big fan too. So much so it Hurts (sorry)
Thanks to the power of #facebook advertising (and my extreme suggestibility); 'Hurts' are my new favourite band.. @infohurts
My cough syrup is 'chocolate cherry' flavour. Er, yuck...
Note to self: stop using the word 'awesome' all the time. It's no longer 1992 and you're in your freakin' 30s man.
I'm at AFTRS (Bent St, EQ, Fox Studios, Sydney). http://4sq.com/9BfdNH
Just got chance to question Triple J's md about music policy. Still baffled and feel excluded...

Excuse the rant, but if you don't speak English at all and you don't know the city you live in at all DON'T BE A TAXI DRIVER THEN!!!
Really trying to get into the @triplej breakfast show. It's kinda inpenetrable, alas.
Thinking of trying that Go Get car-share scheme... Any tips/advice/warnings?
Bring on the election ad media blackout... Just saw the same freakin' annoying Labor ad 5 times in one break. Overkill much? #ausvotes
Interesting Aussie Pronunciation #116: 'Monarch' (emphasis on second syllable. Apparently)
House inspections are always fun when you have to hide a feline and deny the existence of two very well-established 'sub-tenants'... Phew!
@BenFordham Am a blackberry man. You're less likely to fill it with pointless apps and better battery life etc
Hilarious. I'd say sky news's crappy stream of Gillard's nbn press conference makes the point Australia needs the new network badly!
Woke up wondering whether Matt Lucas is contractually obliged to remain big and if Jay Baruchel would ever have got work if he wasn't a rake
Tempted to live 1 week totally selfishly and another 100% altruistically. Will compare and contrast and live rest of life accordingly...
@phil_marriott is it as bad as I imagine? Heard you on bumdar when I was back sounding good - as are n+d. Sorry I missed u in person.

This press conference is really, really hard to watch... Please. Don't. Cry. Kev.
@sfmorris I didn't. After 32 years I've finally realised it pays to fit in with the proletariat :)
Personally, I think the K Rudd spill was a clever stunt to bury the Socceroos elimination from the World Cup story. Clever...
Though we go...
If we win, this is slightly embarrassing and obvious time wasting...
Bravo Defoe!!!
@BenFordham Caught sight of you on the ABC's coverage just now. Hope that ain't gonna cause contractual issues for ya ;) Exciting stuff!

@Rove1974 Just to be mildly pedantic, we're still in the first half of the year. But in 29 days' time, we should all start worrying...

Hang on, media turncoats! I thought you were anti this 16-year old going solo round the world in a pink boat? Bravo, #jessicawatson
What other real option did Clegg have? In any event the LibDems were always gonna be the scapegoat here... #ukelection

I'd really like someone to confirm whether that Ricky Martin legend involving a girl, a TV 'gotcha' programme and a dog is actually true...

I'm bored of chambord...
What is this bizarre Michelle Branch remix making my ears bleed in Campbelltown?

Yes Mr DJ, I would have ended my set with Westlife's Uptown Girl too. Inspired.

What on Earth have I done? Hmm... at least it's hot.
I'm livid. Actually livid. To the point I want to smear my own excrement on walls to get people to really listen rather than assume. Aaargh.
Is 31 a tad old to be a backpacker? I'm not sure if cheap plonk, scabies and deluding myself that I'm 'discovering' stuff sounds appealing..
Attacked by two seagulls outside macca's today. The fast food outlet, not Paul's gaff. Off for austereo interview now. Fingers crossed...
@herrdoktorjones your 40th?! Already?!?! I very much hope so. I'll know more once I find out if anyone's going to give me a fulltime job!
Darwin, here I come...
@herrdoktorjones yes, I'm on Skype - will send you the skype name. A verified account means twitter know who I am..cos of all the compaints!
Leaving Sydney on Sunday. Wish it wasn't so... Ah well, it's the end of a very pleasant era!
@yannicklawry Ooh, I'm now a Verified Account. Like a bona fide celebrity or summink. Joy!!
Impressed with Nova's survey results. Most amusing to see everyone tipsy at lunchtime in celebration...
Nasty Twitter impersonator finally removed.. Glad about that. Not having much luck with protecting my online identity it seems.
Good luck to all running City 2 Surf - covering it on Nova til 12
Working on a massive promotion at Optus HQ and just been chatting to someone called Sharon Bikini. Brilliant!
Americanos; blue jeans and chinos, coke, pepsi and oreos...
ATM, why swallow my card? There are plenty of fraudsters and chancers you could have done it to. Emoticon necessary :(
I've seen 3 albino guys today.
Off to spin. Can't be bothered, but am sure the nice Kiwi lady will get me in the mood with her enthusiasm and repetitive disco beats
Twitter support is *useless*. I've emailed sixteen times over 5 weeks about abuse I've been receiving via the site and not one response...
Um, to dispose of any music taste credibility I ever had previously, I must admit I LOVE that Cascada track. Not in an ironic way either...
Just been to a casting with Richie Neville from 5ive. Weird.
is over overnights.
The Mayor of Mosman thinks Australia's first baby elephant should have been called 'Sydney Mosman'. What a tool.
Have just heard what Chicane have done to Sigur Ros. Feels like someone vomited down my ear canal.
Just heard Diana Ross described as a 'talentless bitch who was just boning her producer'. Kinda apt.
I think i have jetlag. Off to work after bangers and mash. Yawn.
Back on overnights. On talk radio. Double whammy...
Cruising sound sydney in a classic bmw! Sun is beating down and couldn't be happier. Love this city...
I am absolutely roasting! Mid winter in sydney, and wearing shorts and t shirt. Result!
I have a few tickets to Hed Kandi in King's Cross for this Saturday. Face value $20 - yours for $12 a pop if you like!
I have a feeling masterchef is fixed...
Just been affectionately greeted by Kate Richie on the street and blushed like a big girl!
Here comes love, it's like honey - you can't buy it with money..
@sfmorris This picture you see is no portrait of me, it's too real to be shown to someone I don't know. Genius!
@onthedlo Eugh. Not a fan of Twilight boy - esp not with the lipstick
Outside it's raining but inside it's wet
So glad the fat in the hat's been eliminated from masterchef!
AM STUPIDLY EXCITED! Just stumbled upon new Fischerspooner album, bought it and going home to listen!!
Ok, I'm gonna watch Twilight and see if I can understand the complexities of teenage girls' minds
You know that theory; 'if you want something enough, you'll make it happen'? I don't buy it personally...
Brrrrrr...
Just remembered that we met Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders were at Fluffy last night in Brisbane.. They were trolleyed, bless em!
Is it 'feed a fever, starve a cold'? Or the other way round?... Or is it don't go partying 4 nights in a row if you value your health?
Brisbane: fun, but cold. People-wise, that is.
Prince Charming just stacked it. There's blood.
At Disney on Ice... a pure display of capitalism in motion!
Musically, i am 2009, 1994, 2006 and 1988. In that order.
BNE: I'm here.
Australians are fresh food people.
Have i really just seen a tv debate on whether michael jackson is in heaven? More impassioned than a lot of religious debates i've seen  ...
Who knew there was a dirty, decent mix of barbie girl?
RSL Surfer's Paradise. Much like paradise.
Apologies- they were chips. Much more fitting.
Stop press: just seen an obese nun on beach at surfers throwing stones at seagulls.
Am sat at a café at the eastern most point of the Australian mainland. It's warm and surprisingly dry...
Off to meet the newest French baby. Muchly excited!!
Snowboarding: tick. Vomiting on mountain: tick.
Drunken error,but you know what i mean re murray..
Hmmm...
I don't get the Roddick thing. I'm not totally behind him. I know i'm a mongrel brit, but I don't feel anything for him?
I can see the snow...
Have reported weirdo freak impersonator to Twitter. They have yet to do anything about it. Joy...
At risk of sounding incredibly un-masculine; Marley And Me- probably the saddest film ever.. genuinely had to fight back tears.
Off skiing on Friday. In Australia. Now to get all kitted out...
Busy editing the Create Podcast... may well be the finest in the series to date. Watch this space
OK, so where's this unseasonally hot, sunny and glorious mid-winter day I was promised by Chris Bath yesterday. More lies from 7 News... grr
Is it me or does Terri Hatcher bear more than a passing resemblance to the late MJ?
Time to start compiling those 'best of the 00s' lists. Best song was The Killers' 'Somebody Told Me'. Best film..? Hmm.
Actually really looking forward to meeting Pink
@LeighHolmwood Wish I knew... Someone who doesn't know me, but has taken a real dislike to me it seems. Oh, and they're American apparently.
Legal representation sorted.. Not looking forward to the ugly battle, but am gonna fight!
Am being impersonated on Twitter by someone posting hideous comments. Any ideas how to stop it? Ta...
Can't believe about jacko. Actually kinda sad..

No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit
Glastonbury and Wimbledon feel a million miles away - way to make a Brit feel homesick...
playing online Scrabble with an old lady called Marjorie and just scored 66 points with the word 'Minge'
feels worse after 3 days off the booze and eating well... in fact, more sluggish than ever. Yawn!
Can anyone explain the green tinged profile pics on Twitter? Feel like I should do some kinda user tutorial for 30 somethin' techno-plonkers
Chris Brown's gonna get a bashing on the show... Join us: Mathison, Maz and Kerley on Nova - novafm.com.au and across Aus on the FM band!
Just sent a really shitty email to someone who totally deserved it, but can't help feeling I'll be the one who loses out...
My barber today remarked at my ever-increasing bald patch and offered to trim my eyebrows. Way to make me feel young and sexy, shitbag!...
How the hell can Mark Hoppus of Blink 182 tweet as often as he does?! My life is pretty dull on the whole but I'm generally way too busy ...
Crappy lyric of the day pt 2: Even the man in the moon disappears, somewhere in the stratosphere...
.
needs a business visa and hopes Imogen wants an au pair so he can stay for good..
Missing maz tonight.. Show will be great with harlee though! Drive on nova- 96.6 or online at nova969.com.au TUNE IN!
Aussie Bogan or British Chav... which is better?
I'm currently midway through producing my first national drive show in oz. Apart from sweaty pits, all going well! Nova969.com.au
Just been asked to offer my opinion on world religions live on talkback radio. Sure I really helped the debate with my 'on the fence' stance
@matt portsmouth is lovely, i envy you - stop off en route at the spinnaker tower, why don't you? What a monument! ;) Hope all's good, matt!
Looking forward to meeting Aussie Idol, Wes Carr tomorrow and being able to talk freely about Transformers... Yay. Off to work again now...
Mathison, maz and kerley. We're on air now- nova969.com.au. Best show on radio. Have a listen and prepare to be impressed...
I hope UK radio will have found a sense of humour- and a budget- by the time I return...
Sydney Rocks
@jasonrosam Well, it is sunny still. Not that hot I'll admit. You, Keith: Sydney next summer? Things here v good. Chat on Sat?
@jonhillcock Ramsay is big news here. Actually, any time anything slightly interesting happens, it's big news here ;) Aussies love outrage!!
Well impressed with mathison, maz and kerley tonight. Superb show. Back tomorrow from 7 on nova. Bring on drive cover next week!
I had a dream about eating gruel out of a tin can last night. Recalling it has made me hungry.
@jonhillcock I'm at the start of a 12-hour day - audio production now for an AM talk station (glam!) then producing the night show on Nova..
@jonhillcock Kylie's Got To Be Certain please! How's Jon?
is a tweeter stuck in a facebooker's body
@phil_marriott I know - it has a certain class to it though, don't you think? Otherwise tweets can sound like crazy outbursts ;)
is a law abiding citizen with no respect for the nsw police. All undereducated wannabes in my opinion...
wants to cry. Glastonbury 09 line-up looks amazing. May have to pop home for the weekend...
got up at 5am to have paint shot at him by teenagers.
has just realised that tomorrow will be his last day off until 30/6/09
just walked past the petrol station in Redfern where the cabbies fill up and saw a guy filling up WITH A FAG IN HIS FREAKIN HAND. Genius.

thinks simple = better when producing audio
er, it's now winter. Sub-tropical climate my fat, hairy one..

Aqua? http://bit.ly/dhZ1B

My mistake, it's actually Dancing Queen. No redeeming cover alas.

Very miffed that a system file on my laptop appears to have deleted itself and now it no longer works...
will put out for Presets tickets next Monday... s'gotta be worth something to someone?
just shared a lift (sorry - you call them elevators) with Lady GaGa
"I've never smoked", says judgmental man in the gym sauna after I tell him I gave up. "Apart from weed at the weekends, obviously" he adds..
is being taught how to use a phone by someone who thinks they're all very hi-tech...
Ah... Denmark's entry was penned by Ronan "Songs for my Mother" Keating. Figures...
Er, why does every Eurovision song sound like a Katy Perry song? Apart from Denmark's, which is even shitter than that. Bring on the final..
@0JonathanKnight Have you just added the '0' prefix to your twittername, or was it always there? How do, kiddo? xx
SBS are showing Eurovision with really annoying 'yoof' Terry Wogan wannabes commentating. Final screens on Sunday. Party at ours!!!!!!!

spent the day at Bondi and the water was still warm!
can't believe he really just said, 'I think it's her 'Unwritten'' about Miley's new one 'The Climb'. Cos that's a real mark of quality...
@phil_marriott Used to! YES! Yes! Yes... but, alas am probably a little too far afield to make it. Shucks - maybe next time!
@FM1079Oxford Well done on those awards - well deserved, one and all! Y

is having coffee at the top of the sydney tower and appears to have offended the cafe lady..

The bus driver on the 443 is listening to Rick Astley's She Wants To Dance With Me as we sail past darling harbour.

is panelling Jamie like he ain't never been panelled before

is Lindemans supposed to be posh wine down under?

was suprised at the number of weirdos in Katoomba and is now playing LesbiPod en route home
is working with someone who was born in 1991. And is 18.
I'm fed up of giving people things they don't want. Like STIs and flyers inviting them to shitty parties. Oh well...

Keeping everything tightly crossed for that job offer. Also wondering what's fun (and cheap) to do in Sydney in the rain?
: having an off week with twitters/facebook updates. My last few have actually made me cringe. Anyone else ever have that?
wants food, a day off, a full-time gig and to lose weight. A man of contradictions I guess...
is a lovely shade of red/brown. Earth hour starts in 15 mins. Is anyone actually taking it seriously? May have a candlelit bath. Right on...
@maxesse I'm doin GREAT! Having so much fun in Sydney. Missing the club scene in London tho (oops, accidently wrote 'cub scene' - both true)
needs more twitter buddies. Not that you guys are boring (well, you are, but I don't blame yous), but more is more after all. ;)
just linked FB and Twitter. I really am a techno genius.
Just been the mascot for the manly sea eagles. My life is so amazingly random these days. Plus lost half my body weight in sweat... Bonus!
