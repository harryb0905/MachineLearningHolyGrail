@nerdist Actually trying to persuade wife that Patrick Troughton Ferguson would be awesome. She says only if it's a girl.
Robot skeleton & once trusted sidekick Geoff Peterson to attend comicon. I won't. So begins last late night war & the rise of the machines
Holy crackers! Mrs F is pregnant. How did that happen? ...oh yeah I know how. Another Ferguson arrives in 2011. The world trembles.
Off to talking doctor. Ah therapists, you're the  psychic friends network of the bourgeoisie.
Thanks to @michaelianblack for filling in for the last 6 weeks. Many commented on how Scottish his Australian accent sounded.
I just heard that Australian hunk @michaelianblack is taking over from Nicole Kidman in General Hospital. #batshitinternetgarbage
@michaelianblack  People will love your hilarious kangeroo stories. Good to see an Aussie boy doing so well. #michaelianblackisntaustralian.
I"m not taking a six week vacation. There is no guest host. . Cocaine is not addictive. #sometimestheinternetcontainsuntruths.
I hope reports I'm being replaced by an Australian are false. CBS would never allow a foreigner to do the show. Or would they? Oh no!
Full story of the Vermont Alpine Slide Incident on the show tonight. I will show  boo boo.... And also where I got hurt.
Backstage in NJ listening to @randykagan rockin the house. He's the comedy BonJovi.
Thanks Stamford. You took away the pain. You too advil.
Getting ready to go onstage in Stamford CT. Still messed up from alpine slide incident. Foot hurting but the shoe must go on. #sorryforpun.
@kgagne  Now you tell me.  Still I think I might have stumbled upon an effective form of tattoo removal.
Fell off slide at amusement park in VT. Minor injuries. This must be how Fabio felt after being hit by a goose. Current mood- neosprorriny
Good Lord! Have just had amazing cup cake @ Cherry Bomb bakery in Boston. Best thing I've had in my mouth since the 80's
When @kathygriffin clog dances to a mouth organ in the style of toddler pageant contestant it s as if angels were singing. Watch tonight.
The adorable @mindykaling on the show 2nite. What a dame! She's just the sort of friend I would have if I wasn't such a weird cranky loner.
Wore t shirt with suit 2nite on the show. Thought I'd be like Don Johnson. Ended up more like Al Bundy. *sigh*
Home from Sharky  Bahamas to beautiful LA where the predators  wear suits and the Great White is called Betty. BTW Sharky Bahamas etc...
Swam with sharks today. Blew my  mind more than good LSD. Thanks to divers @ Stuart Coves in Bahamas I still have fingers to tweet.
A 12 ft hammerhead shark swam by me today. Yet another reason I'm glad not to be a grouper. Sharks FTW.
Arrived in the Bahamas for Shark Week. If the marine life is even half as friendly as the peeps I'll be fine.
I think my tweety account has been hacked or I'm possesed by a demon cause I didn't post my previous tweet. Maybe it's flashback blackouts.
Will be on wwwKevinpollakchatshow.com. @ 3 pm today. Come on by. Bring snacks. Dress sexy. You too ladies.
@GoatHerderBoy.  Hey! If I'm pretaped for tonight what the hell am I doing at work. Are you at the New York Times or something?
Just so we are all on the same page. I do NOT dye my hair....on my head anyway. Pubes = dayglo orange. Punk rock privates.
@HartHanson  Writing the new season eh? Don't forget my cameo as mad Dr MacBoneo from Glasgow ( you can change the name if you want) xxx
Watched Jaws on cable. Mistake. Hosting Shark Week now seems foolhardy. Sharks unaffected by sarcasm & self loathing. My only weapons.
BIG NEWS on the show tonight. Slightly incontinent with excitement.
Respectable start for USA. For my money, man of the match - Green.
Ok. Hitting mute. Fucking trumpets sound like mutant bees.
Green embracing Scottish goalkeeping technique. Thank God.
Men in dark blue shirts 1-0 down to England. Sickeningly familiar. Come on USA!
Headed to Largo in LA to hang with @nerdist,@donttrythis et al. Honored to be among geek royalty
Big ups to my new BFF @jimmyfallon for spreading the love with the glove. Fuck the haters Jimmy.
Going for sneakers again tonight but perhaps easing up on the bonkers Christopher Walken hairdo.
Jeez. My hair was too high & I wore sneakers on the show tonight. I looked like a cut price Ellen impersonator. Current mood: proud.
Jeez. It's 110 in Vegas. My implants have melted and my eyebrows have scorched off. Won 2nd prize in a AARP Cher lookalike contest
Emptied Dyson Ball vacuum for the first time. Found Jimmy Hoffa.
Also.  Found a penny.
Just used Dyson ball vacuum on my balls. I'm in love.
Just used Dyson ball vacuum for 1st time (on rug not on balls). I am scared   and humbled by it's awesome power. Perhaps we've come too far.
2 days til I return to Vegas and the redheaded midget prostitute who stole my heart. ( and wallet). (and car) (and toupee)
Nice day today. Marinated my burgers in hot sauce. Then went to a barbeque. Happy Memorial Day folks. Thanks to all who serve.
http://tweetphoto.com/23830204 I know I said I wouldn't tweet for a bit but I thought you'd like to see the Peabody award stuck on my ear.
Am embarking on a writing project & will have to slow down on the tweety a little bit but I still love you all. Xxx
Home from Vegas.  My scrotum is in tatters but heart is full of song. Good times.
In Vegas#2. Decided to forego redheaded midget prostitute for nice cup of hot tea. Have now got 3rd degree burns on my penis.
In Vegas. I don't drink smoke or gamble. Getting some very judgemental looks. Better get a hooker -  to blend in. Hm. Redhead or midget?
Sat down after unusually large lunch to read a book & nodded out as if I'd taken a powerful narcotic. Ah pasta, you're like tasty heroin.
Follow @mindykaling for gripping notary  stories. She's the Robert Louis Stevenson of TV.
Wierdly snug suit from last nights show has been retired even though the aging pervert look is de rigeur this season.
In Disney Studio B in Burbank recording Owl's song for next years Wnnie the Pooh movie. What a hoot!
@thomaslennon usually jumps out of a cake in my driveway on my birthday but he didn't show this year. At least Fabio made it.
Happy birthday to @bobsaget & enya & Dennis Hopper & Trent Reznor. I love you guys. You understand.
Thanks to all for the birthday wishes. I'm 48 today. I need a facelift a sports car & a toupee. Or maybe just a nap. Fuck.
Watched latest Dr Who. I think River Song might be Geoff Petersen. Also I'm now afraid of statues.
@pnzr242  No thanks Ian. I am a devotee of dish faced newcomer Matt Smith. Jelly babies are sooooo 4th regeneration.
Just watched my 1st episode of Dr Who in about 35 years. Hasn't changed much. Still awesome.
http://tweetphoto.com/22278326  My friend @TimJRSullivan and I @ lunch at swanky Hollywood joint. Caviar & tater tots (our dancing names)

Im taping podcast with @nerdist on June 10 at Largo in LA. Finally my big break in showbiz. God bless you Mr Hardwick
My autobiography(American on Purpose) comes out in paperback tomorrow. I still haven't read it.
Coffee with @nerdist this morning. What a charming young fellow he is. Also he paid. It felt like he was me & I was Regis.
Added matinee show @ Carnegie Hall on Oct 23. Evening show sold out & I don't think it's smart to piss off New Yorkers
Seth McFarlane meant 2b 2nd guest 2nite after Scarlett Johanssen but I talked 2 long 2 her. He got bumped to 1st guest Fri. Everybody wins.
Up early today. Jetlag + espresso = tweaky riverdance antics before breakfast. I'll be weepy & cold by lunch.
About to speak @ charity event in front of bunch of Hollywood mucky mucks. Musn't cuss or take off my pants.  Musn't. Must not. ....
Eek. So tired can't even tweet. Wrote "stat" instead of "stay". My poor sausage fingers are limp & weary.
Man I'm tired today. Could barely stat awake during show. Now I know what it's like for you guys.
Landed. Van Nuys Ca. Hooray.
Plane refueling in Scotts Bluff Nebraska. Should be home in 3 hrs. Thanks everybody for a great tour.
I always have the same thought in Chicago as I do in Italy. "Why the hell don't I live here?" Perhaps I could take over for Oprah.
Pabst theater has deck & vinyl collection backstage. Listening to old Bowie. Oh sweet Lord it's wonderful.
Fresh LLS shows start tonight through the miracle of pre taping.  All other late night shows live of course. ( also cartoons are real)
Went for a stroll in Milwaukee by the shores of beautiful Lake Oprah. Midwesterners disconcertingly amiable.
Arrived Milwaukee. God bless you Wright Bros.
Backstage at Embassy theater Ft Wayne Ind. Fresh coffee & free chocolate. Good times.
Found a Cracker Barrel in Middletown. Back on the road full of biscuits and regret.
Rollin out of Cincinnati headed for Ft Wayne Indiana. Looking for a Cracker Barrel to have breakfast. We are like pioneers of the old west.
What a splendid audience in the Taft theater. Enthusiastic and dirty. Just how I like em. Thanks Cincinnstanis!
@APexplainsitall  Hey you & zswilder better be a good audience cause the backstage area in this theater is creeping me out.
I've never seen a Saw movie but I imagine them to be a bit like the backstage area of the Taft theater in Cincinnati.
@nerdist  Chris! I'll do yours if you do mine.  Then I'll be on your show.
@mindykaling "if" Mindy?
@Rayscomadtod   Of course being nice pays off. Santa is watching. All the time.
That young @nerdist fellow has the muppets on his podcast. I am envious of him & consistantly impressed by his zany comedy antics.
@abbigail_key  it seems being mean is effortless for you. Well done
Dear All. I am aware I am tweeting my location. I am on tour & thought it appropriate. Thanks for your concern
My what a scrumptious breakfast! Hats off to you Ritz Carlton Dearborn Michigan.
V nice audience at the Palace Thestre.  Thanks Detroitos? Detroitillvanians? Detroitstanis?
On tourbus from Cleveland to Detroit on a rainy day When I was a kid I wanted to run off & join the circus. I suppose I did.  Hooray.
Rolling from Greensburg to Cleveland. V excited to be headed to the birthplace of America's sweetheart @DrewFromTV  Cleveland Rocks!
In a hipster coffee shop (Devi8 )in Greensburg PA. It's raining outside. Feels like Glasgow.
Awake in Hotel room. Bit of jet lag. & still buzzing from fantastic audiences in Toronto. Thanks Canadians you are great fun(& bacony)
Arrived in Toronto. Already bowled over by the friendliness of Canadians and the gentle hint of bacon & maple syrup in the air . Oh Canada.
@pnzr242  Come on Ian. That's not fair. How often have you bumped into Bob Saget in the street in DC. None. Exactly.
In honor of the day the show will be partcularly earthy tonight & all material recycled vaudville routines. Kinda the usual old compost
Oops. I'm in Toronto on Friday not Saturday. I guess I'm jes too purdy to remember stuff  right
Hey Torontonians. Don't freak about the Massey hall gig being sold out on Sat There's a late show @ 10. I think there's still tickets.
@grantimahara Geoff has developed the ability to mimic human voices. Right now he is obsessed with revered gay actors but who isn't
Big snafu on show tonight.  Equip failure. No clips or music. I hardly noticed the difference. Btw Big Snafu is the name of my panda.
I'm going to Canada at the weekend. Hooray for freaky delicious bacon.
@mindykaling  Very few people find redemption in Vegas. I suggest postponing redemption in favor of mild debauchery. & Yes I want to come.
I'm in the 1st & 2nd placed movies in the USA. Can a coldsore be far away. Ah oral herpes. Karma's tickling stick.
Good Luck to Kick Arse( as Mathew Vaughn insists on calling it) this weekend. I hope the Dragons also kick arse.
@malinky2stoatir  You might want to catch the show tonight.
@smilinstanlee  Bravo General. My skelobotrons wrap you in rickety embrace. I command the RSA to follow Stan Lee. Excelsior indeed.
Oops. Willie Nelson not on show tonight. Hes on tomorrow. I hope this doesn't mean I get audited by the IRS.   @kirstiealley tonight.  Sexy.
Genuine American Legend Willie Nelson on the show tonight as a reminder its tax day
@smilinstanlee  Your sabre rattling causes great mirth mongstgst the boney legions. Calm thy rhetoric & join us for snacks & juice. Or die
@kirstiealley  I have a no make out policy with guests. I've only broken it once ( with Regis) so who knows... brush your teeth xxx
Am listening to Brazilian lounge music and playing with my new I-pad. What happened to me man? At least I stole the ipad from Betty White
@k_h_r_i_s  yeah that's batshit  all right.
@KeithOlbermann   HAH!!!! I rest my case. !!!!
NothIng says CRAZY like tweeting in CAPITAL LETTERS. Except maybe mulitiple exclamation points !!!!!
Betty White on the show tonight. Take that everybody else on tv.
I thought Geoff was pretty good on the show tonight but I'm hoping he'll soon settle down and be crap & then he'll fit right in.
I read the tweets of @DirkWeems to clear my sinuses.
My apologies to GeoffPeterson who is an innocent dude. It's GeoffPeterson_ ( note the _) who's the imposter. Sorry innocent dude Geoff.
Hey @GeoffPeterson is nothing to do with me. Probably not a skeleton or even a robot. Follow @ ur own risk. Just sayin.
I think @mindykaling is much more attractive & charming  than a skeleton   robot. High praise indeed.
Robot Skeleton sidekick Geoff Petersen downloading upgrades. Responding well. Already demading a latte
Saw @donttrythis do stand up tonight at @nerdist show. Sensational. Smart people being really funny really makes me happy.
Am going to see @donttrythis do live nerdist podcast 2nite in LA. On same day as robot sidekick delivery  My cup overfloweth
Geoff Petersen the robot sidekick has a metal mohawk & the bluest eyes I've ever seen.
Tonight the robot sidekick Geoff Petersen makes his debut. This ends the domination of TV by partially organic life forms. #lollipoptheater
@TeaTime11 Either Kierkegaard Or not.
I tried the @jimmyfallon chocolate cake on the interns. They seem fine.
I received a chocolate cake from @jimmyfallon because I won the Peabody. He is a god among men. Late night wars my ass.
Holy crackers. A Peabody. Congrats to Lisa Ammerman the segment producer who made the Father Tutu visit happen. I am genuinely shocked.
@smilinstanlee  Great Stan. Yield I beseech thee  or hear the dreaded plinky ribcage xylophone calling roboskeletons to war.
@malinky2stoatir  Never be ashamed of the Macarena hum.
@paulandstorm  I'm trying to get clearance of 'Kung Fu Fighting' for RSA anthem. Will replace "cats" with "skeleton robots"
@RottenTomatoes  Is a misnomer. They should be called Delicious Plums( my old dancing name) thanks tomatoes for being nice about HTTYD.
@paulandstorm  Robot Skeleton already has a song.  It will debut the same night. Apr 5. However I admire your Machiavellian pluck
I will engage @smilinstanlee in double plus secret peace talks tomorrow. Perhaps an alliance can be forged. Gnite Skell - u - trons.
@NakitaOakley  Leave the volcano. You are no longer one of us. Also leave your ID and lunch vouchers.
@grantimahara   Lee is cunning but he has become complacent . He lives in a priviledged world of comfort & free wi-fi. I do not fear him.
@smilinstanlee  Oh Great Stan. You have my love & respect but do not cross the Robot Skeleton Army or we will destroy you and TP your house
@joelmchale on the show tonight. I am as excited as a midget on crack.
Dragon movie made a gazillion dollars. I get  a whopping 0% of the grosses. Don't care. I love that film.
Eek. RT'd anti basketball tweet by accident. I actually rather enjoy it. Esp march madness which means a few extra days off.
Apparently I have a larger part than people expected. (Do your own joke please. I'm taking the weekend off) C xxx
New Mythbusters season starts tonight. Yeah! Take that other channels ( except CBS who, I'm sure, have something adequate as an alternative)
My tweets are dissappearing. Maybe it's the steroids.
Skeletons Ho! ( also the name of a movie etc) Geoff Petersen update on the show tonight.
Sitting in theatre waiting for How To Train Your Dragon to start. V chuffed to be part of this movie

Had bad dreams & woke in a flop sweat at an ungodly hour a cheesy hotel in Florida. & that's without drinking. Happy Paddys Day everybody
Off to bed. Sorry to all the needy tweeters who feel I'm neglecting them. Btw Needy Tweeters is the name I use to clog dance under.

Driving miserable rain in la. Rather lovely.
@phobos8  the ducking fuck eight my breezy slacks.
Oops. It seems "papery" is a real word. Well spotted twitzylstani spelling patrol. Sorry. Off to Bedfordshire with a papery tweet. Gnite x
Ducking spellcheck. Never there when you need it. I misspelled "papery" but that's ok cause it's not a real word.
Sorry I've been so quiet.  Been reading a terrific book. Conspirata by Robert Harris.  Kids, a book is like a long pepery tweet.
Checking out @grantimahara's blueprints for robot skeleton. Beyond awesome but double plus secret so don't ask.
@g253  I like this. Perhaps Geoff Assmodeous Peterson. Yes...yes... That pleases me.
@grantimahara  Im kinda thinking he needs a formal name for the show but maybe his close friends call him P-Funk or Skelldiddy
Curse spellcheck. It's such a prude.
Michael Sheen on the show tonight.  What a hilarious charming adorable fucker is. I had fun.
Michael Sheen on the show tonight.  What a hilarious charming adorable ducker he is. I had fun.

@ventilatorchik   Hey you take cool photos.
Hmmm. I felt a bit down today. Can't think why. Then did the show & felt a bit better. I suppose I love my job.
Ok go video.  This too shall pass is truly truly wonderful. On YouTube
@grantimahara. Warning! DO NOT put the emoticon chip in the Robot Skeleton.
In less than 24 hrs the Skeleton Robots completed their mission. I am so proud. Well done sparky bonesters!
The Skeleton Robots are at your door @grantimahara. Do not anger them. Commence the build of Geoff Peterson. (robot sidekick)
Alright. I gotta go sell shamwows for CBS. Later taters.
Of course I meant hymn. Curse you spellcheck (& illiteracy)
Alright. I thought about. The new battle him of the Roboskels is Kung Fu Fighting (change 'cats' to 'robot skeletons')
@SexySongShow  Not bad. I'll think about it.
Sing the battle song of the robot skeletons " hum dededum dededum macarena,hum dededum dededum macarena!"
@malinky2stoatir  Most trusted  general. Direct the boney legions to @grantimahara. It begins
@sirfoxey   Check your numbers douche
In days to come they will say this was the day the skeleton robots began their march to mediocore latenight domination.
Roboskels. Urgent! I need you to follow @grantimahara. For 100k followers he'll build a roboskeleton sidekick. Advance my rattly cyborgs!
@MythBusters  the robot skeleton army will march on boney toes to your door. Begin construction of THE GREATEST SIDEKICK IN HISTORY!
Hey Canada.  Best of 3?
Typo on my last tweet. Curse my sausage fingers and their large penis implying clumsiness.

Morning Skellyborgs. Many thanks for mega twittlove for last nights show. All credit to S. Fry. Back to normal crap tonight  xxx
Lights out early  in the hollowed out volcano tonight. I will be in the lab constructing my creature. (poop joke there if you so desire) x
Tomorrow business as usual for the robot skeleton army. Fart jokes & innuendo.
Just finished taping show with Stephen Fry & no audience. Thank God he is so erudite & generous. Odd show. Some will like it. Some won't.
I plan on wearing pants nearly every day this week.
In reply to the many who asked it is my guess that Stephen Fry WILL be wearing pants ( or "trousers"as he charmingly calls them) tomorrow.
@missmuley  I never said it was new. I just said I was doing it. Jeez.
I have decided to do tomorrows show with no audience. The entire episode will be a conversation with Stephen Fry. Why? Why not?
Morning you magnificent bastards. Woke up with an idea that may worry the network & sponsors. HAHAetc. More later C x
Instead of sexy dance will have middleaged Scottish dude in a suit do the robot & moonwalk.
Unfortunately just heard sexy dance banned under Geneva convention.
I never said I'd do a sexy dance for 100k followers. You guys did. But I'll do it anyway. Mondays show. Must go oil myself & buy a thong.
Pointy snacks (cheez its etc) are The type which make you itch if you eat them naked in bed.
Robot Skeleton Army over 100 000 strong. Celebratory cheesy puffs in the hollowed out volcano. I decree a day of cartoons & snacks. (pointy)
@joshgroban Yes. Singing & chats would be most welcome. My people will call your people etcetc.   Craig age 47 & three quarters
Alright you mad bastards I'm outtie. I'm going for a snack. Something crisp & cheesy. (sounds like Regis & Kelly) later taters x

http://tweetphoto.com/11720962  Helena Bonham Carter during a commercial break. Girl is batshit crazy. I loved her
Eeek I wrote "of" instead of "off"  How awful. I apologise. The violent alcoholics who taught at my school would be mortified.

@modeMichelle  ur right Coln Firth & I have the same initials. Also Charles Fleischer, Connie Francis & Cutie Fatpants (my imaginary cat)
Wavy also turns up tonight. Seems he's been a bender since the superbowl. Celeb rehab for the crocadeelio if he's not careful.
I keep retweeting by accident. Curse my sausage fingers  Colin Firth  on show tonight. V charming. Slim fingers. Btw Slim Fingers etc etc
@Abby_engh  I'm pretty sure they're just blabbering. I know I am. Oh wait....

@MythBusters  You should also know the robot skeletons are allied to the cheeky monkey liberation front and the cajun crocogator.
@grantimahara  Careful  Your robot cats are in dannger of overplaying their paw.
@MythBusters Also we are willing to put a cat door and a scratch post into the hollowed out volcano.
