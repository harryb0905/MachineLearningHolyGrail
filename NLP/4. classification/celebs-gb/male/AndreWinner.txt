@TomKongWatson @Tyson_Fury hes done well so far but i dont think he will beat haye
thx to @Maximuscle for my supps needed the cyclone after training today
@JONUTC @JudoJimmy all thr best to the lads jon
@craigrams @edgey07 @JeevanSD_MMA C.W is a beast,i like him but im just a bigger A.S fan,it will be though for any MW to beat him
@JeevanSD_MMA @craigrams yeah C.W did well,i think he will go on to be even better,although i dont think he will reign as long as A.S
@craigrams @JeevanSD_MMA i love all the real fans,i just dislike when fans r fickle and negative
@craigrams @JeevanSD_MMA its not about disrespecting other fighters skills,he does it to get in their heads so they make mistakes
@JeevanSD_MMA @craigrams exactly plus its not like u know him,ive met alot of fighters including anderson and they have all been real kool
@waynealfy123 @AkiraCorassani its always easy to boo when its not ur ass in there and ur watching
@craigrams @JeevanSD_MMA fans would get more out of fighters if the supported them instead of being negative
@craigrams @JeevanSD_MMA funny how fighters are all kool with each other and fans get all hyped and upset
@craigrams @JeevanSD_MMA i thought silva could have stepped it up but didnt, looked as though it was gonna be an easy fight and got caught
@NffcD @JeevanSD_MMA yeah no1 wants to lose or get k.o'd but i do think hes not that fussed about the loss &amp; glad 2 have the pressure lifted
@JeevanSD_MMA @NffcD like he said i dont think he wants the belt and all that pressure i think he just wants historic fun match ups
@waynealfy123 @AkiraCorassani the fans that boo are not real fans
gonna dig in to a bowl of lucky charms,thx @iloveamericandy for the hook up
@iloveamericandy i just hope to c a good fight,and i think it will be
@iloveamericandy @AndrewShim @JudoJimmy really want anderson,then i think edgar and sawnson
my nerves r already building for ufc tomorrow,really want anderson to win but think weidman can cause an upset
@BradTavares yep love roy jones but his best days r done and in mma or any other combat sport other than boxing anderson would kill him
@iloveamericandy lol could have done with some for breaky today
@MultiplyM yes also check your pm's
@iloveamericandy  i will be popping in over the weekend guys
@MultiplyM sure i will give you a ring later on if thats ok
