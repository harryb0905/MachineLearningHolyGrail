If you didn't see my post on Monday, I found a couple of gems in my studio recently... #ThrowbackThursday https://t.co/Uj5dnwjFvT
Yes @claraamfo what a throwback! üôå
Dear Mr Cullum. It came to my attention that you are turning 40 this year and we are seriously starting to worry about the validity of this jazz/pop, stage trick. Might you consider a less impactful gimmick? Perhaps biting the head off of something? Yours faithfully, Your Knees. https://t.co/lz6nqpAevv
I realised that my first ‚Äúalbum‚Äù made with the dregs of my student loan and some gig money is 20 years old this year. I found a few still sealed copies in my studio. Shall we do a giveaway? https://t.co/UMVqqBCwMe
I really think I played ALL of these games. https://t.co/Q5ZrevlNDa
Hopefully, you guys should be receiving your #TheSongSociety tees now! Let me know once you've got yours... and send a üì∏ of you modeling it like me! https://t.co/c5ogX40Z5g
@robynrm17 Is that what this is?!
@sodajerker Its a date!
My response when people ask me how the new album is coming along... https://t.co/oK6CtsiNsX

Into my 9th year of presenting on @BBCRadio2... it‚Äôs been enriching in ways I couldn‚Äôt possibly have anticipated. Thank you, as ever for continuing to listen in all around the world. Going live in an hour, tune in! https://t.co/MFL1ieT47a

Goals for 2019 very much reflected in my year 1 school report - ‚ÄúJamie‚Äôs sense of pitch and rhythm continues to improve‚Äù I hope you‚Äôre all having a peaceful time. #schoolreport #goals https://t.co/eALJSgD1qV
Brick (Ben Folds Five). This is a song, from an album that made me want to play, sing and write songs behind the piano at 16 yrs old. Whilst learning it I realised how significant the repetitive piano riff is behind the song's verse, Merry Christmas! https://t.co/Im9SDDv1wo https://t.co/P1VY5HIgeu
@NickiDevon @JoniMitchellcom Thank you. Glad you like it!
The penultimate Song Society track and it‚Äôs a new one‚Ä¶ River by @JoniMitchellcom. Hoping this one keeps you in the Christmas mood as the big day edges ever closer. Have a wonderful day! https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ #TheSongSociety https://t.co/c68dLRR1cj
The Miseducation of @MsLaurynHill is a watershed album for me and I've messed with the song Ex Factor for years. I love @Drake and this 'Nice for What' track which uses snippets of Lauryn's classic. I wanted to challenge myself to have a crack at a mashup. https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ https://t.co/shHD452u81
This song entered my brain by osmosis though I've been a fan of @theweeknd since the early mixtape and after reading that Abel grew up listening to Mulatu Astatke. I heard it everywhere and felt like I could play before I had even learned it. I was wrong. https://t.co/Im9SDDv1wo https://t.co/vsnmjRUekO
The new @MaryPoppins film is superb and has some incredible new songs in it. Including this heartbreaking song which I fell in love with immediately. This is gold plated songwriting! https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ #TheSongSociety https://t.co/sYDB8ic0r7
Uptown Funk - @MarkRonson ft. @BrunoMars. We had about 30mins left and jammed this out! The rising bassline into the chorus is where it's at for me in this one. Clever, clever but almost childlike in its simplicity. A brand new cover tomorrow‚Ä¶any guesses? https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ https://t.co/UcZxNdhBeo
@thisiscarmody It was my pleasure!
PILLOWTALK by @zaynmalik. I didn't click with the song straight away but it was hard to get away from, this song was everywhere! I heard my wife singing it so prettily and I thought I should have a crack at it. https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ #TheSongSociety https://t.co/dhWgNPLfM2
Who me? Oh, just casually hanging out in the studio wearing a limited edition Song Society t-shirt... get yours here https://t.co/iwak1mEK2Q https://t.co/5anjnoe8Xk
@DrRubberfunk Funky Christmas... I like it.
@DogDuckLark @BBCRadio2 Glad you enjoyed the last show of 2018!
We decided to base this version off a blues riff like the song Wayfaring Stranger which I heard @edsheeran do years ago to complete the cycle of influences! Ridiculous musicianship on display here, as ever from @lozgarratt &amp; @bradwebbmusic https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ  #TheSongSociety https://t.co/5c05SrBFG2
I Took A Pill In Ibiza by @MikePosner x @seebmusic. You can practically hear me learning this one as I play it! It‚Äôs super rough but we caught a vibe you know? #TheSongSoceity https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ https://t.co/Mswnd5AYyP
One of the early Song Society covers, What Do You Mean by @justinbieber. Every single sound you hear on this one made by me, in a variety of ways with the piano. https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ #TheSongSociety https://t.co/t4HU3flmZD
I didn't pick the easiest of songs with this one... but it's a favourite of mine! By the legend himself Mr Frank Ocean... https://t.co/Im9SDDdqEQ #TheSongSociety https://t.co/AgDv7mtvmw
The gifts keep coming! You can get a super limited edition Song Society Tee right here for 3 weeks only! https://t.co/A4DIyBcBgA
And we're off! What better way to get into the Christmas spirit than with possibly one of the best Christmas tunes of all time. I couldn't quite manage the @MariahCarey whistle, hopefully, you'll like the spin we've put on this track. Enjoy https://t.co/fO1pYGveBn #TheSongSociety https://t.co/Lkw32As2H2
Starting tomorrow, I‚Äôll be releasing a song every day from now until Christmas, all of the songs are from my YouTube series ‚ÄòThe Song Society‚Äô with a few new covers chucked in for good measure...  Kicking off tomorrow with a brand new cover!  https://t.co/dRgHFkQY0g https://t.co/N8SAWGOUxp

The new @kendricklamar album is amazing. I'm going to be playing this for the rest of the year.
Working on something special with @ImpossibleArk today.
In other news you'll be pleased to know my plumbing is working fine.
@BTCare Last resort tweeting you BT - we've had no phone/broadband for 2 weeks. Emails daily say it will be fixed tomorrow but to no avail.
and to all those asking (and there's a lot of you) - the new album is as good as done. Just mixing it now. I can't wait for you to hear it!
From Dame Cleo Laine to @DirtyProjectors - that's how we do things.
The record I'm playing right now. http://t.co/a5N1VaiR

Prepping all the music for tonight's radio show (with a slight hangover). It's gonna be a good one - from Basie, Camille to Allen Toussaint
Whenever I hear that song "Moves like Jagger" I find myself singing, in a Scottish accent, "Moves like Taggart". It's very satisfying.

.....said by someone who still mostly buys vinyl (and always will) but has been a premium Spotify subscriber since day 1 and loves it.
