What total nonsense! She was wanting a pic but was told to leave by secruity due to her being too drunk. IMO that's the reason she sold a story. Quite strange at the fact that there is no photos of us together 🤔. Supposedly, i gave her £20, is that all she's worth? 😂 https://t.co/w4jWFkjBBH

For those asking, tweets being sent from #TeamAK, not Amir!  The reasons for which are two-fold: 1. The Bush Telegraph’s signal isn’t strong enough to tweet from the jungle, sadly. 2. He hasn’t got a phone. #ImACeleb 🐜🕷🐛
Couldn’t have said it better! #TeamAK are really looking forward to everyone getting to know the real Amir and we really appreciate your support!! Thanks, Tyler! #ImACeleb https://t.co/QKsYW5SJeH

1/2 I know it’s been a year I’ve not fough due to hand surgery. I’m ready to make comeback at 30 years of age. Say what you like Canelo was

Hey guys after a company to sell my merchandise online if you can help email enquiries@khanboxing.co.uk or ring Carl on 01204 535332
In the meantime, I’m going to keep training while I’m back home and look forward to announcing some big news for after Ramadan.
To give an update, I’ve just arrived back in the UK after spending nearly 4 months in training camp in San Francisco.
I’ve spoke with Al Haymon and there are several big fights out there which we’re working on, which I’m sure you’ll all love.
I’m feeling good and at just 30 my aim and focus is to win another world title.
I want to give fans the biggest and most meaningful fights rather than just any opponent
Training with Virgil Hunter and Tony Brady has gone great and I’ve had the chance to work and focus on a lot of things that I wanted to.

12th &amp; Final round great fight. Win this round ward and we got the fight imo.
In to the championship rounds. Ward still fresh and picking shots well. Kovalev tired and slowing down. Being picked off.
Kovalev slowing down. Ward taking advantage with crisp shots and good movement. Picking his shot well. Is ward.
Round 5 being wards best round. Good Movement and accurate shots thrown.
Kovalev looks huge and super strong, with long reach and powerful. Ward moving well against this monster.
Ward down in Rd 2 by solid right. Better 3rd round by ward. He needs to stick and move. Boxing well though
1st Rd Good jabs to the body for ward. Kovalev throwing solid shots. Ward needs to stay intelligent and not get to close.
Let's go @andreward. #KovalevWard https://t.co/1gbTsg8rXq

Manny Pacquiao called me out. Not other way. Yes we friends. He knows the fight won't happen with Arum around.
Yes 147 lbs il be fighting at.
Hands great. Ready for a fight in 2017 https://t.co/YN2Rlf4XJG
Manny Pacquioa called me out seems we both want this fight, Bob Arum won't let this fight go ahead. He saw our sparring sessions in Baguio
Bob Arum would never want this fight to happen, as he knows the other side will win. #Haymon #Arum #PacKhan
I have a style of fighting which would give Manny Pacquioa big trouble. He's a good fighter but we have to put our friendship aside #PacKhan
