Live from London, it’s a very sleepy #Caturday https://t.co/mSlNp0vvIR
@trent_dan @Mazda_UK this sounds like something that might concern the experts @wmpolice #opclosepass
@trent_dan @Mazda_UK Dan, you’re the expert here, but this sounds like a very bad idea to this driver / cyclist / pedestrian / ham-fisted drummer. I understand cars warning drivers somehow, but overriding steering is a lot more than auto braking, for example. All imho, cheers!
@Mazda_UK @trent_dan so the car can see lanes but not people, and will prioritise staying in lane over the driver steering it unless they indicate? Does the car warn the driver of this on startup? What about if it’s a rental car or loaner? How would they know? Is this legal?
Er... @mazda_uk - any thoughts? RT @trent_dan: WTF is it with driver 'aids'? Had the lane-keeping doodad on the Mazda3 intervene and attempt to swerve me back into the cyclist I was making space for when I nudged against white lines... https://t.co/wlZappgifK
@321Giving give them a call, cheers!
@LadyMegSoprano nice! Happy happy holiday happiness!
Woop! RT @OttilieQ: Huge thanks to my lovely friend Kieran for his awesome support over on my sponsorship page 🇬🇧🚲 Almost a third of the way there... #WorldChamps @WTGF_Games @GBTxCyclists https://t.co/C5gLvilGjh
There was an interesting thread on here a while back asking about things that are considered ok now but might become unacceptable in the future, but I can’t find it or remember who asked the question. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance...
Congratulations on an amazing career and bring on the next adventure! RT @CXHelen: “It’s time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I’d much rather say hello. Hello to a new adventure.” It’s time to call Laaste Ronde https://t.co/YBt6JvbS9W
Wow. 2 full pages of names. RT @thehill: Miami Herald publishes names of nearly 1,200 kids killed by guns since Parkland shooting  https://t.co/AaiGY14X3h https://t.co/APbnW24J7v
@dewilvb good question
@purrlinda @MartMcDonald he is, thanks!
This March 2017 article by @timfarron pretty much nails Brexit so far. 🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/09ldXi2Dny
@chrissalmon Maybe they know you even better than you know yourself!
@chrissalmon also, good idea.
@chrissalmon Yeah, which 2% of anyone would *not* like Friends?
Happy #Caturday from an unhappy Pitney at the vet. Not his best week but he’s ok now. Happy 15th anniversary to SOWK too, apparently. Cheers for the reminder @MartMcDonald https://t.co/kvWDcLrWxr
@MartMcDonald poignant indeed. Loved seeing it.
@veeptweet @tomchaplin @BBCRadio2 @LondonPalladium @QueenWillRock I don’t know - he seems to have stopped ageing 🤷🏻‍♂️
This was 👌🏻 RT @tomchaplin: A friendly reminder to tune into Friday Night Is Music Night on @BBCRadio2 from 8pm this evening to listen back to my full performance at the @LondonPalladium celebrating the songs of @QueenWillRock! https://t.co/sq6Q4Wj1sh https://t.co/OvOR1Gb1Fw
@firsthippy ha! Very true!
Ffs RT @Peston: I am told @Keir_Starmer is not the happiest member of the frontbench.  According to multiple sources, he had agreed that the final part of Corbyn’s letter to May would say “if you do not accept this [Brexit offer] there will be a People’s Vote”. One source...
@iammegantoy uh-oh!
Sleepy boys #Caturday https://t.co/VoJqPweSn0
@pam_pamelia it was indeed Alex but in London not OJ.
@jesi_1706 I’ll try to remember to look for it, but I honestly don’t know!

@RantyHighwayman @MayorofLondon really appreciate the info, thanks!
@R_Jean_Carroll wasn’t hard for me to pick a fave song - What Sarah Said is utter perfection imho. Loved it.
@RantyHighwayman Oooh, I am just beginning to ponder an install - have you got any good pointers for somewhere to start? I really have very little idea! Thanks!
@R_Jean_Carroll That is incredibly flattering, Rebecca! What a gig that was. Love DCFC, Plans may very well be my favourite record of all.
@dawninyoureyes1 @keaneofficial That sucks, Dawn. Hope your luck changes soon.
Death Cab for Cutie were brilliant at Hammersmith Apollo this evening. “Thank you for today” is ace, and the vinyl particularly lovely.
Extraordinary - this is what I imagined infowars was like, not mainstream tv. RT @jiveDurkey: this is just such a stunning few minutes of television  https://t.co/da6mbVIL3e
Was pondering this, and the double standards involved. RT @jbarro: I may be proved wrong about this, but I think the coverage of both Harris and Biden greatly overestimates the electorate’s interest in litigating their records from years or decades ago.
When put simply, like this, it is hard to argue against. RT @roadcc: "We don't treat crime committed in cars as serious crime," says Chris Boardman as the driver who killed his mother is sentenced #cycling https://t.co/xmrB2mAn9l https://t.co/MGz2FhZH38
I imagine a lot of people agree with this... RT @davidallengreen: Am neither Labour nor Anti-Labour, but Brexit can only be happening in its current form because of Labour front bench policy.  Sadly, they have to own this mess too.

@Namsstream *shudder*
@Philbar72 We do!
@Philbar72 Thanks Phil. Not too wordy? Hope you are well!
Just been to see #FirstMan. Brilliant film. #RichardReviews
The new @archclimbing wall extension is amazing. So much to try out.
Is this a reboot? https://t.co/dzjfYIb1aS
@sayawordortwo OK, watched it now. It’s heart-breaking!
@philwbass that does help!
Really enjoying the #BBCNFL from London, bit behind because of bath and bedtime (for Austin!) but hope the game carries on how it began. Very cool to have three weekends in London, I really must get to one of the games.
@MartMcDonald @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @jessequinmusic ha! Nobody likes to talk about music, making music and musical equipment more than JQ!
@Keanedith Rocking OUT!
@LadyMegSoprano True. Time will come.
@rosedurecka love it!
@MMTipping @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @jessequinmusic yeah, good question. Thanks!
@MartMcDonald @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @jessequinmusic ...even though we credited him as part of the band (which was entirely appropriate). Love that guy, despite his early tendency to dodge promo. #warningsigns
@MartMcDonald @keaneofficial @tomchaplin ha! I was trying to think back to what we did to launch it, thanks for the reminder!!! Hope you are well, and sorry about the sharpie snafu. Also, Jesse!
Proud! https://t.co/aYw5kEfLUs

@timothypulleyn I’d feign surprise, but, yeah.
@BaronVonGrumble I read this that the rule the driver broke was overtaking a car (“overtook us") whose driver was waiting behind the cyclist, rather than overtaking the bike itself. Happy to be corrected though.
@Thomas94nl @Alphamoongirl Pass.
@Thomas94nl @Alphamoongirl Thomas, I’m not sure we’re gonna agree on this one. Leah, sorry to have dragged you into more reminders of your trauma. The last few weeks must have been very hard for a lot of people.
@endofallfears There are even lower points? Probably!
@Alphamoongirl Well said, and sorry that you have such an awful memory to bear.
@purrlinda It was interesting watching - there were a few who looked uncomfortable, but then seemed to get swept along by the rest of the crowd cheering. Scary init.
@alsovalerie @SilviaDeLosAng9 @keane_mx @LyricallyTC @keaneofficial @tomchaplin that’s more like it. 😇
@CampbellTurner_ Thanks! Didn’t realise it was that long, but they are such an iconic team, got to love them being back at the top!
@CampbellTurner_ ps good to see the Bears doing so well this season!
@CampbellTurner_ I guess we can politely agree to disagree on the credibility issue, but my comment was more about the disgusting behaviour of your president, who continues to plumb new depths, even when you think he has reached the lowest possible point. He should know better, and behave better.
Another low point in a presidency of low points. #BeBest #IBelieveHer https://t.co/PxmwpoHPle

After a year of almost daily frustration, pawing at the window like Andy Dufresne, Pitney finally has a catflap again. As you would imagine, he is showing his excitement by sitting on the sofa ignoring it, and me. #cattweets #crazycatguy #morecatrelatedhashtags #MeowMonday?
@TheCGarrison new fave tweet
@MatthewHaislip @KeaneShadow well thank you both, that’s rather lovely to hear.
Wow. Rachel Atherton is phenomenal. Silver for Tahnee Seagrave too - Brits 1-2! Loving the DH! Can Gee or Danny Hart make it a double? #Lenzerheide2018
@rita_bischoff7 No idea. It’s not us, sorry. Who sent the emails?
UCI Mountain bike downhill world champs are live on redbull tv rn. How strong are the British women?! So much talent there. This sport should be in the olympics - it’s unbelievable how fast these riders go.

Thanks for all the birthday wishes and #Caturday pics. Here’s Pitney, a black and white cat in black and white for @peejie (did I do this right?!). I nominate @LadyMegSoprano (if that’s what’s supposed to happen!). #helptheaged https://t.co/5mtNw6rldC

@dennisjansen93 Best thing is probs to try to find one more person to do some keyboards or rhythm guitar, but appreciate that is easier said than done!
@dennisjansen93 Oh, you mean the strings etc? No way to get them tbh, they are buried deep in an old laptop somewhere, and there’s no easy way of turning them into one mono track, plus you’d all need a click to stay in time with them, which is a pain.
@dennisjansen93 Not sure. I know we mixed all tracks with full instrumental &amp; bv only versions, but don’t know where they ended up.

@fredy_owen @LdnGreenCycles you can get them with motors...
@Lizzy_NL Maybe - not sure about that or a Christiania 3-wheeler. We want something low and stable as Austin gets bigger and heavier, but still able to get around the narrow bike paths around here and not be too bumpy on our uneven river / canal side paths.
@LdnGreenCycles both at the mo, going to come back with the whole gang and try them both all together.
@LdnGreenCycles yes, thanks - already read it!
Popped into @ldngreencycles today - loved the bikes on show. But how to choose between Christiania or Bakfiets…? Think Austin will love either!
@leftieant @badobsessionmsp @mightycarmods It’s always good to share the knowledge. Shaping up nicely though, isn’t it?!
@leftieant @badobsessionmsp @mightycarmods I believe that’s exactly the build we have all been watching. Love it! 🚐🐌

It takes a lot to make a hardcore vegetarian thrill-seeker watch a programme about fishing, but ‘Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone fishing’ is really lovely. #RichardReviews #hardcorevegetarianthrillseeker
A friend just told me about @VeloSouth - looks great! Hope for an entry another year.
@popsgolf I am not surprised, no.
This is absolutely shameful. https://t.co/WpPdEMpEyp
Does Brexit still mean Brexit? It seems unclear from reading my timeline.
@LadyMegSoprano @justanotherdawn Terrible news, but glad you can take some consolation from that.
@nealrogers lol. what a clot.
@LadyMegSoprano @justanotherdawn Apologies Meg, I must have missed this. So very sorry, my condolences from afar.
@mrstkh Great minds think alike, or something.
@peejie Yep. Silly thing is that it’s the one opportunity every 4 years that @FIFA get to recruit a bunch more fans like me, who generally ignore the game totally. Sadly the way the players act (literally) seems worse every time. Doesn’t make me want to watch football.
@iammegantoy @keaneofficial @KeaneShadow @tomchaplin @jessequinmusic ha, I love the reference and the reaction!
@Velocentric Yes!!!
Is there *anyone* watching the footyfootball that doesn’t find the behaviour of many players utterly disgusting? Why are the rules either not applied or different? Watch one rugby match and then tell me it’s just a part of the game. #disgustedofTunbridgeWells #harrumph
Would anyone be left in the competition? https://t.co/4C2sCSLMmL
@PloybCG don’t tell me it did?!
I hope some of the molten tarmac on the roads of Surrey will miraculously flow into a pothole or two. #whendoesapotholebecomeasinkhole?

@ContactKingston thanks!
@badobsessionmsp 😀
@badobsessionmsp I assume the kettle is on too? #vamos!
@ContactKingston Hi there, since you asked... Portsmouth Rd is still terrible. Any chance of another push? About 2 years ago a friend came off their bike when a wheel got caught in a rut right by the pedestrian crossing by Claygate Lane, rut is still there - can see it in this pic. Thanks! https://t.co/R5p1D6ja5T
@LadyMegSoprano You’re going to have plenty to enjoy when your nation co-hosts it* with your friends to the north and south. Post-Trump (hopefully). *if the world still exists
There’s more diving than I remember. #footy
@biciorejon also, congratulations on the PB!

@MartMcDonald Cheers!
Had a great time seeing @MtDesolation I last night, those of you going to their Brighton (tonight) or London (Thursday) shows are in for a treat. Amazing international crowd there too, and it was great to be back at the Louisiana - some blurry happy memories from a long time ago.
@MartMcDonald @tomchaplin Great seeing you!
@AliceDudman @Josephineperry Have you asked the very lovely folks at @CyclefitUK? You never know, there might be room among the artworks, just don’t take your credit card in with you.
@SchmoogyBoo @KeaneUnbroken @beagleworld3 @m_imnk @SlaveLynny @seafrontblog @Alphamoongirl There’s no way a DVD would cover costs. I guess I hadn’t considered the disappointment of fans who missed out on tix as such a downside to us doing the show. I wish there was a solution but we are where we are. Sorry to all who are feeling down about it.
@m_imnk @beagleworld3 @KeaneUnbroken @SlaveLynny @seafrontblog It’s not more important than people, but without the festival there would be no show at all - it’s the whole reason for playing.
@beagleworld3 @m_imnk @KeaneUnbroken @SlaveLynny @seafrontblog That would miss the point of it being part of Battle Festival. Also, it’s meant to be a casual, fun, semi-acoustic show, not a massive production - they take sooo much rehearsal (staging, sound, lights, cameras etc) that a one-off would not make anything for the festival.
@m_imnk @KeaneUnbroken @SlaveLynny @seafrontblog if it wasn’t clear already, I understand that. The point of this show is to play and raise money for our home town festival, so there is no bigger option. I’m sorry not everyone could get in and that the tickets line wasn’t ideal.

@m_imnk @SlaveLynny @seafrontblog @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @MtDesolation @oldjet Again, I’m sorry to hear it. These things are always hard.
@Jennie1964 @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @BattleFestival thanks.
@SchmoogyBoo @Jennie1964 @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @BattleFestival I suspect youtube may take care of that.
@Mark_Engel99 @keaneofficial @tomchaplin Never say never!
@SlaveLynny @seafrontblog @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @MtDesolation @oldjet I don’t know what to say. I’m sorry you missed out. These things never seem to work perfectly, however hard we try to make them, and with a limited capacity this is especially true.
@alsovalerie @PloybCG @Jennie1964 @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @BattleFestival Tickets always say that!
@Jennie1964 @keaneofficial @tomchaplin @BattleFestival I’m really sorry to hear that, don’t know what to say. Livestream isn’t going to happen - it is an incredible amount of work to make it any good, which it would need to be to charge for it. I’m sure there will be plenty of clips online pretty soon after. Genuinely sorry.
I guess we need that third runway because Brexit is shaping up to be such a massive success.

@MMTipping We have spent so much time together he can do both without us worrying. He does it all himself (don’t ever remember him having an assistant) and often in very short order. We got more in 5 mins with Alex than some whole days with others.
If Amber Rudd resigned she’d presumably hand her letter to the person whose deportation target policy she inherited, and who was even less welcoming to immigrants. That might sting. #HostileEnvironment #TheNastyParty #andBorisstillhasajob #sodoesDavidDavis
@MMTipping Alex is the man.
@LadyMegSoprano sorry to hear that but best wishes to her, him and you. Oh, and yes... but let’s ignore the orange man for the purposes of this tweet..

@Yolibeth_Carlon he’s reaching the weight limit, so would need another one soon.
It’s time to get Austin onto a bike - do we get a child seat for bikes we already have (Hamax?) or a dedicated cargo bike with a child seat in the front (N+1!)? Lots of uneven surface riding (towpaths etc) so got to be comfy. Thanks for any advice!

@flordem54638346 I see a coffee cup! I don’t remember where that was, give me a clue! PS era though. Remember the hoody!

Indeed. One person didn’t see the cyclist and 8 people chose to drive past too close. And that’s considered an improvement by the brave officers of @Trafficwmp. We really just need proper bike lanes or it’s never gonna be safe. https://t.co/aqsEQOGcVM

@CsMalatinszky so do I.
It’s nuts that there’s no centralised design for bike lanes in London / the UK in the 21st century. Cyclists soon learn that if bike lanes force them to stop at every side road then they are better off keeping their priority on the main road. #notrocketscience https://t.co/A8u7v68ztV

@SeItSoClear I’m saying that imho those are two separate issues.
@SeItSoClear I’m not sure that’s helpful.
@rr_clebefysh Maybe, but he had 24 guns w almost unlimited ammo. That should be hard to get. The UK experience is that 20+ years after strong controls were brought in, gun crimes have been falling annually. You have to start somewhere.
@LindsayEWarren no probs - got to keep the pressure on, right?
Can anyone who uses the argument “if you ban guns they’d use knives etc” explain how the Vegas shooter, aged 64, could knife 59 people to death and injure another 527 in a massive crowd without getting stopped by the thousands of people there?
@trimjon So you’re just ignoring the point above? Ok, but don’t ever claim to be engaging in rational, sensible debate.
@LadyMegSoprano @emilylhauser he’s pretty great, I must say. #prouddad
@trimjon Sorry, that’s just nonsense - can you imagine the 64-year-old Vegas shooter knifing 59 people to death and injuring another 527 without someone successfully intervening to stop him?
@CampbellTurner_ So how’s that working out for you? 430 killed in school shootings alone since Sandy Hook. I despair for your great nation.

Speaking as a colourblind person, different climbing walls can be quite baffling. Do us a favour and use one series of holds per route (not a mix) and maybe clean them occasionally. Also, patterns really help. Thanks! #climbing #bouldering #colourblind #ta

On the upside, while Trump and Piers Morgan were talking to each other, neither of them were on here.
@Alphamoongirl @mariadsanches @m_millsey wow, that’s another ridiculous line-up. Radiohead had just released The Bends iirc. The whole thing blew our tiny provincial minds. I reckon I owe a huge debt to Bill Berry for the education.
What part of “Brexit means Brexit” don’t they understand?!! (For the purposes of twitter I’d like it to be clear that I am kidding and that it’s a fucking terrible mess that I wish wasn’t happening). *POLITICAL JOKE ENDS* **Makes note not to repeat** https://t.co/bHQuZYQCYv
@Alphamoongirl @mariadsanches @m_millsey yep. Saw them several times, felt very lucky to have done so. 95 show opened with Sleeper (loved them!), The Cranberries (loved them too) and er… some band called Radiohead 2nd on the bill. Whatever happened to them, eh? Still got a t-shirt somewhere!
@Alphamoongirl @mariadsanches I dunno - where to start? I especially love songs with strong @m_millsey vocals, so 'Fall on me' is definitely one of my all time faves, but I can’t pick just one… First R.E.M. live show I saw was on the Monster tour (with Tim!), really love Bill’s drumming on that album.
@Yessixoxo Yep. It’s almost hard to know where to begin. I’ve been detoxing a bit - deleted the twitter app from my phone a while back and don’t miss it, but kids love screens… tough init.
@Aleeza1995 I am so annoyed - saw the first two sets then had to go out… and saw the result!!! Damn! Sounds like a pretty great final though.

@LadyMegSoprano I suspect this is in Northern Ireland, where certain colours do indeed carry some heavy history, but I am in no way qualified to comment on specifics. Brexit (UK leaving the EU) has raised issues regarding the N.Ire / Eire border, which some say threaten the peace process.
@MMTipping I think the last show was in Jan 2015 - a charity performance for Nordoff Robbins. It was about as bad as you could ever imagine for a last show.
@hlimpo @babs196455 very glad to hear it.
@purrlinda he likes them - if he’s in the mood! Not a scratcher though, thankfully!
@Geraint__Lewis @justanotherdawn @KeaneShadow That’s Mr Hughes to you, thankyou very much…!
@MMTipping thanks, it was really lovely to be back on stage with TC.
@LadyMegSoprano Yep, he likes it - I don’t know how, but neither of them are scratchers or biters. We are so lucky!
@LLoehman I’m sure any drummer friends would be happy to help - drummers like more drummers!
@CsMalatinszky such a great photo!
@ItzyTonks7 @tomchaplin sorry to have missed you but have a great trip!
@babs196455 you too!
@justanotherdawn @KeaneShadow *like*
@purrlinda it’s irresistible!
@hlimpo @babs196455 aw, poor Pintas. Sending love!
Archie fluff #Caturday https://t.co/DdvpFcRU9g
@LadyMegSoprano This makes my heart go boom. So so relieved that Archie came back. I was starting to worry…!
@LLoehman I’m gonna let him have a go on mine soon. He loves waving drum sticks around!
@LLoehman hard to tell without seeing it, but they normally clip on with some kind of tightening mechanism. It’ll sound much better with a pillow or cushion put inside. The heads on the kick drum shouldn’t be too tight by the way.
@sambawoman @Nigelstewart76 lovely!!!
@LLoehman bloody love that!!!
@LLoehman Great present!! So I think the photo is taken from the back - so the pedal goes that side (not the side with the logo on it - that’s the front). The other two should just be at a good level to be within reach, the same as the cymbal. Good luck!
@CerianMusic thanks, and for the link. It’s the future, I tell you!
@GdnReadersEd @GuardianHelp @guardianmusic thanks very much, really appreciate it.

@guardian please could someone correct my name in your Tom Chaplin review? Thanks! https://t.co/In4rj7cNIF
@TobieTripp Likewise and hope you do too!
Thanks for all the kind tweets, I can’t possibly reply to them all, but I’m glad tonight’s show brought a smile to so many faces.
@LindsayEWarren @MomsDemand Just home from the show tonight… he’s asleep (and I should be too!)
@TTRJMassivefan Thanks Nicky, I’m very well, hope you are too.
@LindsayEWarren thanks so much for the @MomsDemand swag and your note. You are too kind!
@sayawordortwo sorry, I’m keeping this one, but I’m glad you liked it!
Had so much fun tonight playing SOWK with my buddy Tom and his lovely, fantastic band and crew, and watching the rest of the show. Thanks for letting me borrow your drums Seb, and merry xmas everyone. #TwelveTalesLDN
@Velocentric It’s genuinely hard to believe. What have we become?
Just. So. Awful. https://t.co/U84PqEEog6
@FerFeynman that’s kind of you to say.
@cvp2 Lol. I was particularly lucky - we leave a cat box out all the time, and he happened to be asleep in it at the time I needed to leave. All I had to do was shut the door! Felt almost cruel… almost.
@pipamoka he didn’t love it - it’s normally both of them so going solo might have freaked him out a bit.
@babs196455 @chaplin_sally nothing too bad, he’s just been a little unsettled lately, so we were getting him the once-over.
@mtb_tom ugh.
@mtb_tom also… why don’t passengers intervene?! Is there a rule that they must never ever politely question the twat who’s driving *them*?
@mtb_tom You have nothing to apologise for, just glad you survived.
@MaruLauS yes, he’s ok thanks!
@chaplin_sally ouch, get well soon!

@SarahH922 nice! Manchester is such a great place, especially for a music fan like you!
@SarahH922 Good thanks, hope you are too!
@TheCGarrison yes and yes, and yes please!
@mariadsanches @littlepigletta The thought had crossed my mind…!
@MMTipping I haven’t listened yet, but only just got round to downloading… any faves?
@hlimpo @CBCTheNational indeed.
@SchmoogyBoo wow, they have such similar markings, you are absolutely right!
@amdr182 it’s acoustic - I have nothing against electronic kits, but I just love playing real drums, and I have a few…!
@flgazr1 @Babs_BL but neighbours would!!
@AndersBay just for playing to be honest, though I could probably get a reasonable drum sound in there. It’s a small room though, so not ideal for proper recording.
@richardbrunning hope you are well by the way!
@richardbrunning Wow, that must be supercold this time of year! Mine is in a basement so lots of natural soundproofing plus not too hot and not too cold (hopefully!). We’ll see!
@popsgolf this is just playtime, but who knows!
@littlepigletta yep - when we last visited Tom he (TC) started playing his piano and Austin was spellbound* - definitely going to grab a keane piano from somewhere for the new house. (*in a good way)
Soundproofing approved, I have drums at home for the first time in years! #todaywasagoodday
@AliBunkallSKY nailed it.
@G1g_junkie @jessequinmusic @ShEvgenia 😘
@Velocentric did it come (backwards) from the right? Looks like maybe the end of the barrier is just creeping into shot. Either way, I blame the cyclists / autonomous car / non-existant badger that the driver claimed to be swerving… ENDS

@mattyglesias Something about The Art of The Deal.
@HrishiHirway I trust you have prepared Josh’s podcast “no no, no, no, no…” quote in preparation for his almost identical utterance on the show? I meant to note which episode, but it was early… Just checking, like. #bigfan

@andrew_drinks @MartMcDonald @TuulGerel That caption is perfect for photoshopping.

@dzmilner oh boy… let me guess - there’s an incredibly handsome young-looking but steely, tough guy... possibly with a beard? The kind of guy you’d want on your side. Am I right?
@TuulGerel wow, back before grey hair I guess! Part of H&amp;F touring? I remember going to the building by the Olympic Park in ATL.
@psyklyn @OvercastFM thanks!
@Isitaboutabike thanks!
Of course trying to browse podcast apps brings never-ending requests for passwords and usernames across multiple apple devices. This shit *used to* just work.

@jessequinmusic I remember a particularly bad rendition of PS in Dublin when I looked over at Scott mid-song and he just shrugged. Said it all.

@WinkyMcBumnut @quizeye @camsell59 @lionelbirnie @richardmoore73 @friebos @robhatchtv definitely want to do Roubaix sometime.
@Philbar72 @lucap14 @quizeye might be enough time to get some fitness back!
@mutablejoe it’s smart tvs these days - I was offered one on a petrol station forecourt only on Saturday. White van. Bloke. Definitely legit!
@MMTipping totally.
@lucap14 @Philbar72 Oh man, that coffee and cake was glorious. @quizeye
@beyondironsea @littlepigletta Thanks Chris, appreciate the offer!
@quizeye - Flanders was really special. Def worth trying! https://t.co/r1R29zCm23
@MMTipping I sat at his kit at Madison Square Gardens when we opened for them - we chatted setup etc as you do… lovely fella, and yet so surreal to be sat at his kit, this guy I’d studied playing for so long. Hero.
@littlepigletta It’s more an issue of sound escaping the room than treating the room itself. I’ll get there, just have to be methodical I think! Thanks!
@MartMcDonald Looking at that site, might be able to do decoupled ceiling… it’s knowing where to start init…!
@MMTipping damn right. Now’t wrong with Premier, though I’m a yamaha man myself. ALl those years watching Larry Mullen Jnr I guess!
@SoniaRayS @marie_P_1974 if only that were true!
@MartMcDonald Studios are as often trying to keep noise out as in, whereas I’m just trying not to annoy anyone. How are you anyway?!
@MartMcDonald It’s a space issue tbh, doesn’t need to be completely soundproofed, just take the worst off. Helps that it’s a cellar already.
@titinchago not yet - got to sort out the room first!
@MMTipping I love the feel of real drums, but there’s no doubt the digital options are incredible, and great value. I’d recommend a few lessons too.
@littlepigletta um, 2 doors and 2 double-glazed windows, am working on filling all gaps, edges, etc.
@marie_P_1974 sadly we only ever rented the busses, and my garden wouldn’t fit one. Also, the conversation with the neghbours… just gonna leave this bus here - ok? Cool.
@Philbar72 @lucap14 opinions gents? https://t.co/Vjg1XG0A0W
@PaulitaKeane thanks. Sadly not the quietest!
@treetopthingy this is a very good suggestion!
@pentimentos it’s a cellar so not a bad start. Fallout shelter would be great!!
@CXHelen my pleasure, congratulations!
So far the drum room isn’t particularly soundproof... unless a drum kit is quieter than the Arctic Monkeys played on an iphone. 😟
Podium! Whoop! https://t.co/B8hnTLHgJ2
@PloybCG full bottles of wine?!!
@marie_P_1974 brilliant and possibly the best country for such a thing!
@LLoehman good question. Kyle now has a bar in Portland ME called “Maps” and the @bissellbrosbrew there was definitely up there.
@MicroBeers it’s brilliant. Mine would probably last til the following xmas, mind.
@BigOnManners ha, of course not - with his Scottish heritage he’s more of a whisky man.
I love this idea! https://t.co/vxHNVXfeUQ

@TuulGerel @carly82 @tomchaplin I did have to cuddle the first one for a while because it was quite cold and damp. So very cute. The little kitty meows were heartbreaking.
@PloybCG @pipamoka @tomchaplin Ha! Luckily enough (for me!) I happened to be there anyway, and on a #Caturday too. Couldn’t make it up!
@carly82 @tomchaplin Honestly, if they hadn’t needed their mum they might have been coming home with us!
Photo just in from @tomchaplin - the elusive 4th &amp; final stray kitty has been caught &amp; returned to mum! Yay! #CaturdayonSunday https://t.co/rHH4q9F4Kt
@pipamoka @tomchaplin Yes, Glorious was no threat (and is a very very cute puppy!)
@jesi_1706 between the two - darkish grey with stripes.
@moonflower197 yep, they were doing ok, so pretty confident they’ll be ok now they are back with mum.
@marie_P_1974 wow, well done!
@Simona_sim163 that’s very good!
@LadyMegSoprano still hoping for good news. Today’s events hopefully a good omen!

@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial oh Ted, I'm starting to wonder if we'll ever truly be friends. 😔
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial So my point, Ted, is that you shouldn’t assume that you know everything about me just because I went to a posh school. Thanks for listening.
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial My parents believed they should do everything they could to provide my sister and me with the best education possible. This was their goal.
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial My grandparents served in the forces in WW2, then worked variously for the railways / NHS. I believe they helped pay for my posh school...
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial My mum worked at various local schools as bursar, including a brilliant school for kids with learning difficulties in St Leonards.
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial Ted, I don’t know why you keep mentioning Daddy (I call him Dad) but he worked (very hard) as accountant at British Gypsum, a local factory.
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial no Ted, I did indeed go to a posh school (on a scholarship that helped with the cost) but that’s about the only thing you have got right.
@Shout2YouRadio @TuulGerel @keaneofficial Ted, I’m not sure where you are getting your information from, but imho you need a better source. Thanks for the kind words, Tuulie.
so… forgive me, but are @irobot vacuum cleaners any good? #somuchcathair

@Shout2YouRadio @keaneofficial Hi Ted. I seem to remember Tim was the early tweeter, so he probably set it up, long time ago though. Re: deer, I’ve been veggie 29 years...
@Shout2YouRadio I see. The band is @keaneofficial (use for generalised abuse), whereas this is my personal account (for abuse relating to me specifically).
@Shout2YouRadio Hi Ted, I should probably point out there’s only one of me, unless your tweet is including Pitney? He didn’t go to private school, just fyi.
@BMEBRoadie yep. Hope all’s well pal!
@moonflower197 I’m not sure exactly, maybe 3 hours? Felt quite long. Esp when you feel like it’s drawing to a close but you haven’t seen Indy yet.
@dr_bumble yes! It was bloody loud but I thought maybe I was just getting old and grumpy. @sfgirl agrees too. #wisefriendsoftwitter
@Shout2YouRadio Ted, you seem to be a little bit upset with me but I’m not sure why. I hope this photo of Pitney will help. #HappyMonday https://t.co/5vsYlYSDEp
@_LikeAFlower definitely. Love good or very bad Sci-Fi!
@KaArtigas78 It wasn’t just me then, thanks and hi!
So… Bladerunner 2049. I enjoyed it, but by heck was it long! #RichardReviews
@Shout2YouRadio All I can say is that you’re gonna be pretty horrified with what happens in 2015,16 &amp; 17. #SpoilerAlert
@hlimpo thanks!!
@U2FromMARS Pitney wins this time!
@hlimpo thanks - he’s done the jump a few times so has it pretty well dialled in. Glad it worked out - I have to spot him in time to film!
@andriazhar yes but it’s a private account just for friends.
Definitely a *new* new new low, not an old new new low, or even just an old new low. The lowest ratings. Sad! #justhopehedoesntbombsomething https://t.co/jHNNzopyEU

Well worth supporting RT @IpswichClaire: Please sign &amp; RT this petition, it means a lot to me: https://t.co/Qk2RqxWC8R via @38_degrees
@LadyMegSoprano @velocast Yep. I made a trip to Bastogne a few years back, to Noville, Foy and Bois Jacques. Incredibly moving, highly recommend it.
@quizeye Will they never learn? The sense of entitlement is, imho, a reflection of the party itself.
Desperately hoping to make it to this: https://t.co/PHnFGXzFlK
I was gonna try a reply, but then I read the existing replies and they’ve already said it better. You nob. https://t.co/KKDj4GyirN
@velocast For some reason you've reminded me of this, for which I’m grateful. I may now have to rewatch the series. Again. https://t.co/Aql1uJAJ2k
@velocast President Bartlet, if you don’t mind.
“It's the classic Washington scandal. We screwed up by telling the truth.” - CJ Cregg, The West Wing #Rex #morongate
@poniewozik nailed it.
Also @jonlovett on @PodSaveAmerica "You’ll see the politicians say “There’s just no words.” Why don’t you have words? Are you surprised?”
“Why would we approach this differently [to fire]? It’s a public safety issue.” Well said @jimmykimmel, well said. #VegasStrong #gunsense https://t.co/kVlpkNgYLx
If you haven’t seen “Runnin’ down a dream” then I cannot recommend it highly enough. RIP Tom Petty.
A good musician friend of mine was in bands through the 60s &amp; 70s, saw pretty much everyone play. His opinion? Tom Petty was the best.
@elliotjacobson likewise!
@elliotjacobson Well said. Glad to see you are well but sad that it's in such awful circumstances.
@pipamoka @KeaneShadow @keaneofficial @KeaneArgentina @keanefans mine too.
@pipamoka no!
@TeaCakeBiscuit just caught up on this, very sorry to hear it. Hope you are well.

@roadccdave it's a high bar but I'll keep trying.
@donna_bellav @parksandrecnbc I struggled with the UK Office - it was (sometimes) too excruciating, but maybe I should try the US version?
Also want to thank @HrishiHirway &amp; @JoshMalina (of the always-excellent @WestWingWeekly) for nudging me into re-watching @parksandrecnbc
@ShellPoppins @tomchaplin that is very nice to hear, thanks!
@helenasofia01 @girlsHBO I couldn’t begin to tell you, best watch for yourself!
@BegumNadiya Thanks so much, and rest assured the feeling is mutual! @tomchaplin
[I know I am so very far behind but] ep8 of the final season of @girlsHBO is some of the best telly I’ve ever watched. #RichardReviews
@KimmyT22 @littledebmeyer @tomchaplin that’s very cool, thanks!

@Doctor_Hutch you should totally blog that. Be great on instagram too. #etc
@andrew_drinks bon voyage!
@quizeye hopefully, but someone needs to start talking sense pretty soon.
@Andrea30360 honestly it seemed so calm!
@driftingaround I happened to see him or her arrive around 6am &amp; settle in, guess for a sleep through the day, til Pitney came to hang out!
@greenpen9 furball-tastrophe!
@pipamoka I think a little bit keeping an eye on me, and each other, without staring - iirc direct eye contact is aggressive.
@Jujube_blue welcome!
@PloybCG maybe, but that's a good thing!
@Lunedetemps I didn't know that! I wonder why not. They are amazingly well adapted for city life here.
@justlaurabee ha!
@LadyMegSoprano indeed.
@Andrea30360 or me taking a photo!
@mariadsanches yep, they are incredibly common in London (and most UK cities).
Pitney made friends with a fox the other day #Caturday #friends https://t.co/3AnWymnwC4
@TuulGerel no idea. Could just be slightly awkwardly-worded. Maybe ask Tim &amp; Jesse at the gig!!! 😬
#hbd @thewatchhouseUK in Bermondsey- 3 years of exceptional post-@archclimbing coffees and lunches. Bloody nice people too. ☕️❤️👍🏻
@driftingaround exactly. They might as well put signs on the doors that say “Exit at your peril” etc.
@donna_bellav @ritabischoff77 when is this historic event?
@AccioFlones thanks. I was exceedingly tired, quite pissed off, and I have to dictate all my tweets to an intern who knows how to use the world wide web.
@helenasofia01 isn’t everyone? It’s my generation*’s Cheers. *I haven’t actually been elected yet but it’s surely only a matter of time.
@remco1993 @PjMllr what, no clave?!

@remco1993 @PjMllr is it a bit loud?!
@ShellPoppins On your rec we just watched ep 1 - so far so good, ta!

@PjMllr @remco1993 Sea Fog was not a time thing, it was better the simpler, shorter way.
@remco1993 @PjMllr I honestly can’t remember for sure but that sounds right (the total time thing).
@just_wizzard that's what I thought - see, I do remember! Thanks!
@KeaneChile thanks! Hope you had a great night and that Seb played the keane songs well!
@just_wizzard indeed! Did you give me the cassette? I think that was then, but either way it was a fun trip, hope to return someday!
@TFPS thanks! That was very sweet and the cake looked great!

@davidanson61 already was, now even more so!
@SeattleAF @andrew_drinks Andrew, am I moving to Seattle too? Were you planning to surprise me? You are too much!!!
@Kezmo63 Sorry to hear that!
@brendarts And don’t beat yourself up either! Do you have any veggie pals? Maybe see where they like to go and treat yourself! Finally, yay! Awesome!
@brendarts Also, don’t get too hung up on ingredients of stuff you like initially. Lots of things have unexpected gelatine etc, but don’t worry!
@brendarts Sorry for the slow reply, been thinking about this - it’s hard for sure, but I guess maybe start with a simple veggie recipe book and see?
@biciorejon having said that, best wishes to @ozDanJones for the future!
@biciorejon completely agree - have loved BSP and will really miss them. Probably the best way of getting to know the riders I've found.

Thanks for all the birthday messages, we took Austin to see @astro_timpeake’s Soyuz capsule at @sciencemuseum &amp; I nearly set off the alarm.
@wilz_h_75 @Hopetech @sohobikeslondon perfect. Do what the rest of us do and buy one, then another, then another!
Checked out the new HB160 from @Hopetech at @sohobikeslondon - that's one beautiful bicycle. I might need a skills upgrade first though.
Must be hugely disappointing, but it was an amazing ride, surely shows the record is breakable. Well done Jasmijn and team. Until next time! https://t.co/obVXuTqhno
Allez @JasmijnMuller1 - heading on north through the night, utterly amazing effort. Great work by her support team too... #LEJOGrecord

@Bossier_Lily I’m happy that you are happy!
@antonybutcher @JasmijnMuller1 yep, think my day 2 stop was Bath - not far now!
@velocast @TheCGarrison please don’t stop this excellent discussion, I am thoroughly enjoying it. #thisfreshhellshitisfire #orsomething
So after 5h of cycling @JasmijnMuller1 is already way past the place I stopped after 1 *day* of LEJOG! #LEJOGrecord #amazing
@15MTL I can't expect her to be doing things for me while on a TC tour, but hopefully you'll get chance. Thanks again!
@andrew_drinks wow!!! That sounds very exciting. Always loved that part of the world. Enjoy your last few days in Europe.
@andrew_drinks say what? Where are you off to?
@andrew_drinks I did 9 days of about 100 miles each. It’s absolutely nuts to try to do it in one go!
Good luck @JasmijnMuller1 #LEJOGrecord #hero
@driftingaround he is just so good. What a cast!
@helenasofia01 I was fucking terrified. I have no idea how TC could even do all that stuff, it was ridiculous levels of pressure. Phil Collins was lovely.
@helenasofia01 Quite the VIP intro, eh? (just thinking about that pressure made me sweat!)
Watched Mississippi Burning the other night. Incredible film, sadly all too relevant for these times. #RichardReviews
@Anelimusic yes! Mrs H bought me a copy - it’s a good read!
@Jujube_blue not seen Bloodline, but Deadwood was a tourbus fave, and enjoyed Justified until it got really silly.
@robdlgardner best of luck!

@eyesofcloud feels like a few shows get this way - if you know it inside-out then fine, but to the more casual viewer (me!) it’s like, wait… who?! what?!
@Kezmo63 me too, but evenings are precious!!
@eyesofcloud i just can't follow it - I'm sure the plot makes sense to the writers, but I can't remember what happened 2 seasons ago.
@treetopthingy aye, me too. Reminds me of touring.
@LadyMegSoprano not tried it.
@_adam_barker loved it!
@daveboneherron @SunderlandAFC ha!
@greenpen9 yep, big WD fan but wonder if, at some point, it may actually end?!
@helenasofia01 yep, will be giving that a go, ta!
@ds_stef oooh, a good pal has been banging on about that… ta for the reminder!
@greenpen9 The first few seasons are def worth a watch, but the most recent lost us pretty fast, sadly.
@Jmattox49 sounds like I should, but I don’t think I can!
I’ve also given up on House of Cards, and don’t get me started on Homeland. Ugh.
@CEAHenderson13 so was I! So disappointed, but this one just doing nothing for me. Cheers!
@citymap yeah, that went all kinds of wrong!
@ritabischoff77 dunno, never watched it. Not generally into the genre, but guess it’s pretty great given how everyone raves!
@CEAHenderson13 fair enough, but not sure I can cope with any more. Well done you for making it through!
@Velondon ugh. the thought of ploughing through the rest of 5, plus 6, 7 &amp; 8 though… I love the two cops, but the rest are too cartoonish for me.
@Velondon really? honest Q!

@ContactKingston thanks. Whole rd is bad but there’s a rut at pedestrian crossing btwn Giggs Hill Rd and Claygate Ln that took down a cyclist.
@ContactKingston Please could you arrange for Portsmouth Rd to be resurfaced? The bit from Laithwaite’s down towards Esher. Ta!
@PloybCG it’s best when everything is grooving, so can get a little messy if someone’s off their game. Also, lots of backing vocals! Cheers.

This morning’s reading - Whitehouse divisions, allies’ surprise re Trump’s approach to NK; FBI raid Manafort; Trump new low ratings. #MAGA
@MMTipping (plus 2 days at Air previously, just to be precise!)
@MMTipping Yeah, it was the first time I’d ever done the whole record in one hit - 2 weeks at RAK &amp; drums all recorded (plus lots of other stuff).
@MMTipping I just let the producer do what they prefer, to be honest. So many variables these days. Dan was ace, nailed his drum sounds &amp; the most fun!
@RoyceHartley thanks!
@MMTipping PS was all straight to digital iirc. NT also digi as mainly done on the road. Don’t think I’ve missed anything else!
@MMTipping Andy recorded drums to tape then imported them to digital. Dan recorded straight to digital. We did live straight to vinyl in Nashville!
Again, is this a new new low, or the old new low? I lose track. So many new lows, he really has all the best new lows. Tremendous new lows. https://t.co/FenNFBLbXP
Update: there are no steel @Keith_Bontrager frames on ebay at the mo. Damn / Phew.

@littlepigletta @Jolouise25 @CCCMercedes @citymap I can’t remember it, but we did have an (early) Atari - 2 joysticks, each with one red button. It was absolutely bloomin brilliant!
@littlepigletta @Jolouise25 @CCCMercedes @citymap It felt so futuristic at the time - plugging the computer into the tv aerial, tuning… all to play a game that was a tap of the space bar!
@littlepigletta @Jolouise25 @CCCMercedes @citymap I think I can beat that - a C16… iirc. Cassette loading and all.

@gabstab It’s got Jason Bateman in it - I’m in!
@mariadsanches Mrs H has been recommending that one, def on the list.
@gabstab no, what is it?
Better Call Saul, however, continues to delight. How did I never spot “S’all good, man”?!! Best thing I’m watching at the mo.
Frustrating when good TV shows' plots get too complicated without reminding us what TaF is going on… House of Cards the latest, sadly.

Bloomin proud of @chrisfroome, lovely to see him smiling so wide on the Champs Elysees.
@farish_paul cheers!

Can’t find who tweeted the link earlier, but this is a lovely piece on the magnificent @rogerfederer by Tom Fordyce https://t.co/HKkrw1gNpy
@hlimpo he nailed it 1st time. We stood there in awe. He’s pretty slow-moving most of the time! Then Pitney jumped up a fence that’s taller than me.
@MMTipping yeah, it was a good idea, that - I think courtesy of @gribiche
@hlimpo he’s been practising, so I’ve been trying to film it for a while!
@rainborn8228 @tomchaplin that’s very similar!

@daveshaped that’s very cool to see, and sounds great!!
@TuulGerel @veeptweet @MMTipping that’s good to know - I think it’s a corker (though this one was more Tim with guest performances than a true Keane effort).
@veeptweet @MMTipping you win the award for  'most exotic location to watch the film' though!
@Jess1820 The countryside around is lovely; The outdoor store (if it’s still there!). Great food… also a ton of good gig venues &amp; music / drum stores.
@MMTipping ...but it was definitely written for the film.
@MMTipping I believe Tim wrote it for the scene in the fairground, but in the end it was the only non-classical music in the film so wasn’t used there.

@tomstaniford and I know it’s not just about London, but it seems like a pretty important model for the country at the mo.
@tomstaniford indeed. We need to keep up the pressure. I honestly believe @MayorofLondon wants to make progress on it.
It doesn’t mean NO cars, just fewer. Not NO taxis, but hopefully fewer stuck in jams. Not NO trucks, but safer roads for those we need...
It’s hard, &amp; it costs money, but it’s possible, &amp; it’ll improve health, air quality, ease pressure on NHS, &amp; make daily life better.
…and I include people with special mobility needs, kids, families, the elderly… not just the people you see on bikes now, but everyone.
Years ago we realised that pedestrians need kerb-protected footpaths, we now need to learn that people on bikes need protected bike lanes.

@KeaneShadow I definitely wanted to play it…!
@katyscottkaty @KeaneShadow it was my fave drum part of all of them, I think. It is tricky to all play together, but I loved it.
@KeaneShadow apparently it didn’t sound good enough (or we weren’t playing it well). There was always a spot for it in longer sets.
@KeaneShadow I was disappointed we didn’t get to play it more often.

Shame on @theLTDA yet again. They offer no solutions, just oppose oppose oppose (even though this scheme may well *improve* taxi journeys). https://t.co/yxEzjD5ZpZ
@perfectionvalet is that the worst state of any car you’ve ever done? @DickieMeaden give the rallye a gazebo for xmas! (or flog it to me!)
@ButlersVehicle @BMW_UK @BMWi @HarmanKardon I believe it was. Sounded lovely!
I see the annual Amazon 'something about a drone delivery’ advertorial is out. Every year, the news laps it up. #Chrimbollocks #taxavoiders
@Jhanni I would. Can be done the same time as neutering so they won’t feel it. Also, our cat flap detects the chip so only they can come in.
Even the audio is out of date. RT @MartinHoscik: Met spent £1000 fitting a CD player to Boris's unused water cannon https://t.co/8S8xAEIKYh
C'mon @SadiqKhan, you can do it! RT @mragilligan: this scheme was rejected as not good enough almost four years ago. https://t.co/0YV6abTo8G
2nd station I clicked on (Rambouillet, France) is only bloomin playing @tomchaplin #goosebumps #tomshaplan https://t.co/CroiMooFJP
Does CUBO stand for “shoving cyclists out into the middle of the road for their own so-called safety”? Just a guess. https://t.co/mAjZp4s3RZ
@roadccdave that was my reaction too.
Evening mtb ride max heart rate 202 bpm. Number of foxes spotted: 4; Badgers 0 (down from 2 last time). #CycleStats
@littlepigletta @sambawoman I have no idea why they just look so cool. South African / Japanese are RHD so maybe… cc: @KeaneFansSA!
@archclimbing yay, more run &amp; jump problems. 🙄
@sambawoman Just dreaming. I think the back bumper would have to go. Beauty though, right?
Podcasts I’ve been loving lately: @LRCkcrw (weekly); @WTFpod episodes esp Neil Young &amp; James Taylor; @WestWingWeekly. #RichardReviews
