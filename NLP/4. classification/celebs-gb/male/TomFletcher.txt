Just warning you so you don’t all get mad at me...I might get a Christmas tree this weekend.   Sorry not sorry.  🎄
@Jessicooo @SueHarleyy Then think of it like this, your buying an album that comes with a free book! Don’t want the book? Give it to a kid who loves reading! Donate it to charity! I’m trying to combine books and music, two things I’m passionate about that I think compliment each other perfectly.
@Jessicooo @SueHarleyy When it became clear McFly wasn’t going to happen for a while after McBusted, which wasn’t what I wanted, I put my focus onto other projects but it has in no way been the reason why we’ve not been active as a band over the last few years.
@Jessicooo @SueHarleyy Jessica, I’ve resisted tweeting you back about this many times. You can assume whatever you like but I’m afraid it is utter nonsense and had it been up to me we would have been back out with a new album the second McBusted was over.
@mcflysky You really should be a detective or something.
@SueHarleyy Sue, the reason we haven’t made our next album yet has absolutely nothing to do with my books or projects. I would have loved it to have been made and released a long time ago, as I know all of our fans would. So please direct your anger elsewhere.

Thanks to everyone who has read Eve of Man. Getting so many incredible responses, especially now people are off on holiday, book-in-hand. It’s a very special book for @MrsGiFletcher and I, and we’re blown away that so many people have joined Eve’s journey. #freever 😉

@thexwho I’m working on a lot of projects that are music based (film, stage, books) but no, I’m not releasing any music as a solo album or new band if that’s what you mean.
I don’t think any of us wanted to define it as a hiatus. It wasn’t planned, just sort of happened for one reason or another. Sorry if it’s not been clear but there’s nothing happening right now and we’re all working separately on different things. Not split up. 👌🏻 https://t.co/EecHA2oi3C
@jakijellz Always. I didn’t want to be in this position but this is where we are and we’re all just getting on with stuff that makes us happy.
We won’t release anything to keep anyone at bay. We’ll release something when we’re ready &amp; right now we’re not. We don’t have any plans to write/record/perform together as McFly at the moment, we’ve not split up &amp; are all happy &amp; supportive of each other doing different things. https://t.co/hCCx7c9UTH

@mcflysky @MrsGiFletcher 😍thank you x
@Clark1995Clark @MrsGiFletcher Thank you 👍🏻
I’m on @lorraine tomorrow morning with @MrsGiFletcher chatting about why married couples should never write a book together...especially not a trilogy! 😜 #EveOfMan
Research chat for @lorraine tomorrow. https://t.co/0iCi8AKEWD https://t.co/KKnVxcTZD1
Thanks @t22felton, I’m throwing this over to @idougahole @dannyjonesofficial and @harryjudd #beatplasticpollution @unenvironment https://t.co/VA14yHQsxw
@Kevsie I don’t, I’ve been up there many times on book tours but it’s a little tricky this time as Gi is pregnant and we have two kids we don’t want to be away from so the tour is smaller and shorter.
I just found a chunk of something my son ate earlier IN MY BELLYBUTTON!
Finished it?!?! We’d better get a move on with book 2 then! 📚😂 https://t.co/THaxE41Fzn

@elsampson1 To create an infinity moment. A moment that you get stuck in forever...it could be a second/minute/day/year but it whatever you choose lasts forever. You live inside it and never leave. You can only use this power once so you have to use it wisely.
@Justinai14 I don’t even know what that is.
@dammitangie I’ve probably forgotten the best ones.

Just to clear things up on my last Instagram post...yes, the cheese is under the beans. The house is cold and I was worried that placing the cheese on top of the beans wouldn’t create sufficient heat to melt it. I made an executive decision to go cheese first and it paid off.

@Sj_fletchers @MrsGiFletcher I always know everything🍕
@HelenmichelleD @MrsGiFletcher Thank you.
My wife just ordered pizza. I’m so glad I married her right now.
@jamiepwns We’ll release music we want to be heard when we want people to hear it. Thanks. X
@dannyuck Same
@tomsbellybutton I’ve never lied and when there’s nothing to say I say nothing. When we’re planning to write and record I’m sure we’ll let you know. Until then though 😶
Check it out! So incredibly proud of this book. It’s amazing to be collaborating with my wife @mrsgifletcher. This is a little teaser trailer directed by @davidspearing. Full trailer coming soon!  Link in bio #EveofMan #EoM https://t.co/DT9nNLYRDy
I hope so! https://t.co/ORZVPsIB2Y
Can I just clear this up...the reason McFLY haven’t released any new music is not because I’ve “been too busy writing books”. I appreciate and share your frustration in the absence  of McFLY lately.
@Jessicooo Because McFly isn’t my solo project. It takes 4 to tango.
Thanks so much for all the messages about EVE OF MAN and to everyone that’s already pre-ordered it. So glad we can talk about this now. It’s been 5 years since @MrsGiFletcher and I came up with the concept!

You stand to get off the tube and realise it’s the stop BEFORE your stop. Everyone on the carriage seems to know what you’ve done.  Do you:  A: Get off. You live here now.  B: Get off and change carriages, hoping no one notices (but they will).  C. Suck it up. Own your mistake.
