@SantaKlausH @UnionOnion When are you going to list somebody who acted in the name of atheism? Not, happened to be atheist.
@axlotl Good example but I was really thinking in contemporary terms, certainly post enlightenment.
@Legendgerry @saoili But in the name of Communism, not atheism.
@JoshDWalrath Yes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm asking. Where are they?
@TigerUnderGlass Hitler was also a dog lover, it doesn‚Äôt mean all dog lovers are xenophobic, genocidal maniacs.
Political ideology is not the same as atheism. I only ask because atheists are often accused by theists of having no moral compass.
Has anyone ever committed an act of violence or atrocity in the name of atheism? Is there such a thing as an unreligious extremist?

It just occurred to me, the slo-mo gunfight in Spaced took place outside The World‚Äôs End pub in Camden. It took us 15 yrs to move 10ft.
Too Many Cooks is so deftly engineered to unnerve stoned people in their mid 30s, it might actually have been created by the US government.
@pommelstone Oh fark off you killjoy.
@DilleyAndrew @Diablere Wrong. The story telling, character development, arcs, concepts were all better. Wake up and smell the poodoo.
@d_m_elms And don‚Äôt get me started on the Equestria Girls!
@J_P_Quin No, they are separate Universes because Tim and Daisy went to see Chasing Amy together at the Odeon, Holloway. #checkmate
@d_m_elms Thank you. I was only winding you up by the way. I have watched Rebels, it‚Äôs a lot of fun, with a lot of SW love in its veins.
@ourmatetone We all were.
@kwick22a Of course! But which one?
@d_m_elms Make sure you‚Äôre home in time for your cartoons. ;-)
@Diablere That‚Äôs not enough. I understand how much you want it to be good in some way but I found letting go of denial really therapeutic.
@d_m_elms Yes, yes. Run along and play.
What people always seem to forget, is that Tim loved Star Wars, he just hated the prequels. The pyre? You always hurt the ones you love.
@d_m_elms Ah you must be under 10. I apologise.
@JasonWStanley @Rob__McCallum Sorry chaps, you don‚Äôt have the keys to the canon, so suck it.
@d_m_elms Never heard of him. What is it, some sort of expanded universe bullshit?
In post Spaced character canon, Tim Bisley worked as a concept artist on Star Wars: The Force Awakens, specifically on droid design.
I forgot the birthday of my beloved friend and on set health professional, @MoragWebster yesterday. No more Heimlichs for me. Love you M.x
@MattDowner1970 He won't let you down. :)
@Squirrely99 Morning. :)
@Ant_BlasterzZ I wouldn't hold it against him, as long as he doesn't put his fur in a ponytail. :)
@lazyhazee Good man. It's always good to stay positive until it's impossible. I saw  The Phantom Menace TWICE! :)
@capelrigg Enjoy Interstellacticals. :-)
@lazyhazee Somewhat naff? I think it's fantastic, simple, to the point, doubtless descriptive of a story point. Exactly what it should be.
@Ant_BlasterzZ But Wookiees live for 400 years and Chewie was 200 during the first trilogy. He's aged 33 years, relativity, that's 8 yrs.
@MattDowner1970 So, you just don't like it because it sounds "off". Without knowing how it relates to the story? Try being positive.
@lazyhazee Why? What's wrong with it?
@MattDowner1970 Why?
@TravellersTunes It‚Äôs going to be so far, far from shit.

@jpers36 My friend, I‚Äôm happy with the conclusion I have come to, as I hope you are with yours. Peace and love.
@jpers36 Well from the late nineties, yes. So wait, all the deified characters in religious history across all faiths, they love me too?
@jpers36 Then Harry Potter loves me too! We all win. ;)
@XianJaneway Whatever gets you through the night. It‚Äôs alright, it‚Äôs alright.
@jpers36 Did he tell you that?
@XianJaneway That‚Äôs rationalism whispering in your ear. Go with it.
God‚Äôs a sort of Santa for grown ups, isn‚Äôt he? He‚Äôs got the beard and everything. He doesn‚Äôt withhold though, he burns you forever.
@Smitchalot You‚Äôre telling me I can‚Äôt use certain language to express what I mean? What if it‚Äôs not flippant and contextually correct?
It‚Äôs passive aggressive to the point of emotionally schizophrenic. Why are you telling me? WHY?!

If you missed Iggy Pop‚Äôs, John Peel lecture on free music in a capitalist society on @BBC6Music last night. Catch it on iplayer. Wonderful.
Quick question for the kids. Do the music charts mean anything anymore? Is ‚Äòpop‚Äô music relevant to anyone other than children?

@jonahray @edgarwright @nerdist That was incredible. I will always respect you for shooting yourself in the mouth like that.
@jonahray @edgarwright Don‚Äôt blame our devastating win over team @nerdist on a hangover! We owned the lanes that day.

@JamesGunn It‚Äôs where all the cool kids come onto each other these days.
@JamesGunn @jonahray @slashfilm For the record, original NOTLD is best and Return is fun but more of a parody than Shaun was. *High 5s Gunn*

@HenshawDavid No, wife and parents, same as most and Emma doesn't have kids. #getoffyourfuckinghighhorse
@DugyFresh @poorlilhayley Thanks. It's whatever you choose to put in it, my friend. Friends and family essential. :)
@MeanbreedDave If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. You got Doc Manhattan as a background, man. Expected more.
@MeanbreedDave It's not a bandwagon, it's a smart initiative from an influential person and my getting behind it might help. That's all.
@garywhitta Guilty! *vanishes in a puff of smoke, slight cough*
@PJ_DWPub On it. Every day.
@MeanbreedDave What the fuck do you know about what I do? Your crass, smartness, negative bullshit is a blight. Do something nice.
@garywhitta Some people don't have any coats, Gary. Think on.
@PJ_DWPub Am I not allowed to learn, change, evolve?
@MeanbreedDave You misunderstand, I'm supporting something positive which is better than doing nothing or being an utter fucking prick.
@Uptomyknees Good luck mate. Sorry about mad pee lady.

140 characters prevented me from listing the other, super important, totally beloved, ultra cool, woman in my life. Bro 2 my Sis @katypegg
@_glen_c0c0 The point is, we are all in this together. Let's pick our battles and fight them hard. Peace and love, my friend. :)
@_glen_c0c0 Yes but in this instance, it wasn't. It was an indication of my personal relationship to three vital female figures in my life.
@_glen_c0c0 I wasn't identifying them, I was identifying me. Please understand context, to avoid pointless, knee jerk criticism.
@EricVespe Yeah, I hate those guys. ;)

@purenorton Come on Jonny, you will have to do better than this holier than thou school yard crap. Explain to me how I ‚Äúsold out‚Äù.
@purenorton Selling out means doing something for monetary gain which contradicts my personal standards of beliefs. So, how did I sell out?

@RedMonkImages I feel for your situation but do not suppose that depression discriminates in anyway. It is naive and dangerous.
@RedMonkImages Are you saying that wealth is a cure for a chemical imbalance in the brain?
@RedMonkImages Are you saying depression only affects a certain section of society?
Thanks to everyone who came to my digital party at @NYDailyNews and hello New York, it‚Äôs good to be amid your glorious blocks again.
Thank you #TIFF14, that was relentless fun. Time to head to NYC for more of the same. Alfred, would you mind bringing the jet around.

Good morning North Africa, let‚Äôs make a film and stuff.
@bonniegrrl @edgarwright @headgeek666 @nickjfrost You should make that movie! And Shaun of the Dead 2 and a third series of Spaced!
@bonniegrrl @edgarwright @headgeek666 @nickjfrost  We know it as ‚ÄòLiving Dead at the Manchester Morgue‚Äô here in the UK. Classic Euro horror.
Just spoke to my wife on the phone and she informed me that she'd just let the dogs out. Well, that answers that question, finally.
@MarillaWex @gameratheart He looks great but you need to step up your game if you going to pull off a convincing @nickjfrost

Whenever I see a cinema that's been turned into a pub, I understand how Jesus felt when he saw that church had been turned into a casino.
It's funny but I still get that little knee jerk, early 90s, PC indignation when my mum calls me a cunt.

@ymackie Not funny.
@ymackie But I specifically adopted those tropes, in order to facilitate the joke. It was necessary to generate irony. It required cliche.
@edgarwright Yeah, I'm on anyway.
Din dins + @edgarwright = imminent. Hope he puts out, because I am ultra horny.
@ymackie It's a joke about my feminisation, using a convenient biological frame of reference. Your obtuseness is a) mean spirited, b) dense?
@ymackie No, I'm out with my girlfriends and we're getting mani/pedis and going shopping. It's real not a fucking value judgement.

Oh you want another shot of me in the Star Trek sex harness? Why didn't you just say? *makes noise like horny cat* http://t.co/hzJNH1t38V
Here's another one. Me and Pine rocking the neutron cream. Failure to apply may cause reddening. #StarTrek http://t.co/WRHR3mUBeo
Good morning Utah. Found this delightfully sexy BTS Star Trek picture to kick off the @FantasyCon day. http://t.co/rzTI0n7V2E
Walked into the hotel and there was a lounge band in the bar, playing Creep by Radiohead. I like Utah, it's exciting!
Oh and huge thanks to LAX border patrol for being absolute darlings today. @FantasyCon here I come.
@profpieface It was a guy.
Watched the sublimely brilliant, Grand Budapest Hotel on the flight to LA and then accidentally called an immigration official, darling.
Can't wait to run the steps in 90402 next week. Been a while, gonna go for the full 10 and get a real sweat on. #yeahboyeeee
@MyDogAteLA Should be. :)
@classybroadclub Ya daft thing. We could have had a hug.
@MyDogAteLA Listen to Faith by the Cure. All Cats are Grey would appeal I'm sure. Oh and Ms Needypants much!
@MyDogAteLA One day, dear girl, one day. :)
@NO1Fangirl @SimonNickEdgar BOO! :) x
Also on repeat, in complete contrast, some lovely post Mary Chain fuzz from Paws - Owl Talons Clenching My Heart.
Currently on repeat, Mapei - Don't Wait.
Off to Salt Lake City, via LA on the anniversary of that historic day, when Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum gave the mothership a cold. #PEACE!
@lucy_lucyfisher Probably best.
@lucy_lucyfisher Apparently there's going to be random drugs testing.
School sports day, today. I've been training for this for months. Sack, egg &amp; spoon, three legged, those other dads don't stand a chance.
I am very excited about @FantasyCon. Think I might cosplay as Sulu.
@Simon_Pegg_Mwah Mwah back atcha.x
@elevensbowtiee Reading something at the Hertfordshire Children's Book Festival, which @freya_north has organised with my wife, @maureenpegg
@elevensbowtiee Awesome!!! I want them with a big mug of tea. Right now. ;)
Woah! ‚Äú@queldridha: @simonpegg my artwork  #simonpegg http://t.co/eclnboFm3J‚Äù
@Squirrely99 You are special. :-)
@edibow Went to the soundcheck yesterday. Not gonna make it tonight. :(
@loreladyblue @timbird84 What's comedy without a little tragedy, right?
@juliemccoy_ @nickjfrost Great eyebrow game.
@Squirrely99 Gary drinks to medicate his depression. The apocalypse gives him a purpose, which enables him to be sober. Ergo, happy ending.
Had the kind of day that makes me want to sing and dance and wet myself and not necessarily in that order.
@Squirrely99 Gary is all about the underdog, when the Blanks become marginalised he sides with them, simply because they are cooler. :)
Nice! ‚Äú@timbird84: The World's End &amp; the end of capitalism http://t.co/OwOSsrN9lV on Wright and Pegg's vision of globalisation &amp; the crash‚Äù

Will be in LA this Sunday to break bread with my boy, @edgarwright and talk about the future. Plans will be hatched.
@danielmarkavery Ha ha!
@danielmarkavery Cheers Daniel, Drone Logic is a gem.
@CHIMPSINSOCKS Yeah.
Atheist parenting is hard. "Daddy, is God real?"  "No, darling." "What about Santa?...Daddy?" "Shut up, I'm thinking."
"I just don't believe there is a big man in the sky, sitting on a cloud. I mean, he'd break it wouldn't he?" You have to love kid logic.

@ElizabethGlass_ @EverydaySexism It wasn't about geography, it was about the severity of the crime. Peace and love. Don't think ur a dick.
@beetlxbum You don't have to look at it in the morning. üòú
Thank you @Variety, this is rather nice. http://t.co/hCoeD4AUXL
@ElizabethGlass_ You misunderstood and still seem to misunderstand my point. Let's agree that the OT is a prick. Have a great weekend.
@ElizabethGlass_ @EverydaySexism It wasn't a blanket generalisation, I was saying all forms of discrimination are unacceptable.
@ElizabethGlass_ @EverydaySexism I think you know what I meant. The OT was saying because there is arguably worse, don't complain.
@skepsheik No because the key factor there is context. Are we using it to be misogynistic? No. Because people say it inappropriately? Yes.
@ElizabethGlass_ @EverydaySexism I was comparing being flashed at to physical violence. The former is deeply distressing but less traumatic.
@skepsheik You think, "that was a bit misjudged, maybe don't do it again, you silly boy". Next question.
@skepsheik @EverydaySexism Every straight male is likely to be guilty of objectifying women at some point. Key is modify your thinking.
@ElizabethGlass_ @EverydaySexism A horrifying and depressing statistic. Hope it was clear I do not share the views of the original tweeter.
@AccordingToMe87 ...of Mormon. :)
@Becksmeister My fucking peanut butter!!!!
@thebigragoo666 Personal is political. You start where you can make a difference. Change one mind at a time. It's a war not a battle.
My wife told me to take it down or @PythonJones will smack my bottom. Maybe I want my bottom smacked. #verynaughtyboy
@thebigragoo666 @EverydaySexism It's all relative, don't be an idiot. You think because there's rape in the world, lesser oppression is ok?
That picture was from #AbsolutelyAnything by the way. You will have to wait and see why. #nospoilers.
#ff @EverydaySexism for an expos√© of the shocking amount of dicks in this world. Rather embarrassing reading for the male of the species.
@Scroobiuspipyo How appropriate I had a flashback to rolling under things and climbing up things with unprecedented realistic motion.
Providing there are no visa complications, I'll be setting off for @FantasyCon a week, today. Very excited to be visiting Sal Tlay Ka Siti.
@CHIMPSINSOCKS That wasn't a Dundee Cake.
@CHIMPSINSOCKS I have never and will never own a pair of crocs. As for the other thing, I had no idea you were with me in the pantry.
@CHIMPSINSOCKS My what?
Whenever I see a grown man wearing Crocs, I always wonder exactly when it was they gave up on life.
Look what I just found! Whoever said, don't go down in the basement? #throwbackthursday http://t.co/XKyYh2KnLW
@RobertAgiu1 No, this is a single tear of unabashed joy. :)

@BBCRadMac @alporlas It's okay, I pulled over to tweet as a way of reducing my heart rate, which had been elevated by proximity to death.

Monday you fool, what have you done with the sun? Can't you do anything right? Sometimes I think you get off on making everyone miserable!
@dreadpirateruss Alright but it was a very silly thing to say and that kind of kamikaze defence is beneath you, I'm sure. ;-)
@dreadpirateruss idiot.
@DavidStreet76 Never give up, never surrender!
@thelancearthur You like to imagine me creaming my jeans? Christ.
@miltdavies Yeah because kids just love tax disputes and infanticide. That is a weak and reductive argument.
@scottEweinberg @Uptomyknees Clones is worse than TPM and Revenge is too little too late.
@TheLWA That was due to his character which came before his illness.
@TheLWA There's no such thing as a former alcoholic, change your thinking.
@RDPomin Uh...no, they are not.
@iOrder66 @Jedi_Alba @TheCloneWars Since you want me to hear you. I don't like the prequels (or special eds) but Clone Wars was pretty good.
The hate I get from prequel apologists is similar to the scorn heaped onto a non drinker by an alcoholic in denial.
@Scroobiuspipyo Short help is better than no help at all. That what I always say to the wee guy. :)
The man who invented big beat with Tomorrow Never Knows and a mother flippin' Beatle is in the house! Peace and love, it's @ringostarrmusic

@KennerToys @StarWars7783 I bought an X-Wing from Toys R Us last week. Couldn't resist the old school packaging. I was powerless to resist.

Double #OITNB for me tonight. Nothing like spending the evening with the inmates of a women's federal prison. Love this show.
Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive, Dodge.
@Si2013w Let's do both! :)
@robfoley Are we not allowed to have different opinions?
In the interest of perspective the ITV countdown clock to the England game should be accompanied by a countdown to Isis reaching Baghdad.
Does anyone know where I can view matches played in the football World Cup championship? I believe it's being held in Brazil. Nothing on TV.
@Zinnzade @RebelForceRadio But it doesn't take any effort.
Hear some of these stories told by @neilhimself http://t.co/ZZfx0Nk76t #WorldRefugeeDay
I believe that entertainment is an overrated function of art and we should be challenged by what we view and read. http://t.co/3awralQjIH
@bnycastro A hater is someone who hates  for the sake of hating. My feelings on the prequels are based on the fact that I don't like them.
@bnycastro I thought @TheCloneWars was great.
@paulshipper It‚Äôs an RT from @StarWars7783.
@danlesac Somebody gave me one of those and I gave it to the dog.
Say what you like about The Hunger Games, it has enabled the toy industry to market close quarter combat to young women. #nerfrebelle

@Que__Linda You‚Äôre welcome. :-)

That was fun! @SamuelLJackson‚Äôs super selfie to follow. No sign of Hiddlesbiddleswiddles though. Maybe he was keeping it low key (Loki). Ha!
Off to stride down the catwalk like a boss, in aid of the One For the Boys cancer charity with @SamuelLJackson and @twhiddleston. Word(s)!
@IamHappyToast @edgarwright We are always trying to make a point, otherwise what‚Äôs the point?
@IamHappyToast @edgarwright No, that only demonstrates your complete lack of understanding of Gary, addiction and the film.
Has it really been a year? Happy Father‚Äôs Day, motherfuckers!
@MyDogAteLA I‚Äôll take both.x
I‚Äôm going to bed. Goodnight.

My buddy @AIRBORNAXE is graduating from college which is weird because when I met him he was a kid, but cool because that shit is cool!!!
Thanks Berlin. That was a long day at the promotional coalface. What I‚Äôd really like now is a 2-3 hour massage and a bucket of ice cream.
Guten tag Berlin!
Goodnight folks. Off to Berlin tomorrow for more press. Last time I was there, I went clubbing with Kirk, Spock and Uhura. #energize
Hmm, Sky Movies ask me about Rik M today and now that section is up on their news site as comment along with plug which seems disingenuous.
Quite the day on the promotional hamster wheel for @HectorFilm. Very much looking forward to you seeing this one. What a journey it‚Äôs been.
The Young Ones was to comedy as punk was to music and we have lost a true pioneer. Waking up to a world without Rik. Farewell People‚Äôs Poet.

@SamWitwer The greatest long term marketing scam the world has ever known. Larry Flynt man, the dude had vision.
@bluebirdcage Cheers K.x
Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a child of the 70s but whenever I pass heavy undergrowth, I can‚Äôt help wondering if there‚Äôs any porn in it.
Starting press duties for Hector and the Search for Happiness today, starting off with a visit to @empiremagazine. Great way to kick off.
I hear there are zombies in Crouch End once again. Much love to all the walkers at the Maynard. Stagger back to the bar for shots!
Zombie walk in Crouch End tonight culminating in a hometown Shaun screening. Rise, 8.30pm at the Maynard Arms, on Park Road. No running.
I just did a 60 minute high intensity work out, then ate a big steak. I need to get in touch with my feminine side. And tap that ass!!!!
@MysteryBritExec @TheTessMorris The real reason was because he kept asking if he take her up the North Mountain.

This Saturday, 8.30pm. Crouch End ZOMBIE WALK! Meet at The Maynard Pub, then shamble to outdoor screening of Shaun of the Dead at 9.30pm Go!
Don‚Äôt stop me now!
@johnpavlich A few perhaps, for pace or story but you have to know what film you are making. It saves a lot of time and money.
@MysteryBritExec That's easy for you to say.
Humans are weird.
@Rob__McCallum @nickfrost I have these framed on my office wall. :)
If I see a film DVD boasting 22 deleted scenes, I don't think, "great value!" I think, "write the fucking film, before you start shooting!"
Rewatched @BradBirdA113's brilliant The Iron Giant today. Such a beautiful film. "I am not a gun." Show your kids!
Ha ha! What an adventure that was! ‚Äú@Rob__McCallum: @simonpegg ah the good old days http://t.co/YLkgR76ynj‚Äù

@EricVespe Physical effects are on their way back. I really liked the prequel. Shame they relegate the dog scene to the credits.
@EricVespe Let‚Äôs do it. Just watched the ‚Äò11 prequel, then immediately watched the Norwegian Base scene of the ‚Äô82. Quite fun.
@EricVespe Ha ha. We should get married.
Hey Sweden! They‚Äôre not Swedish Mac, they‚Äôre Norwegian.

Massive and heartfelt thanks to all the Trek fans who came out  to the Albert Hall last night. Thanks for giving it all you‚Äôve got. LLAP.x
That was extraordinary, @m_giacchino‚Äôs score sounded glorious and the film was lovely to revisit. Haven‚Äôt seen it in a while. Very proud.
210 days until Christmas. I am literally losing my shit! I don‚Äôt know where it is. I‚Äôm that excited!
Off to the Albert Hall to see @m_giacchino throw down some serious Trek vibes, with a live performance of the ST09!score. #amped
As a man, you get to an age when every time you get to the bottom of another tub of hair wax, you punch the air and say ‚Äúyesssss!‚Äù
Why suffer the emotional anxiety of trying to convey the minutiae of your innermost feelings when a simple fuck you shitstick, will suffice.
ICYMI A few of the many things that make @edgarwright one of the finest directors of his generation. http://t.co/rV5kQdJYEm
@mingjzhao "Driving" Ha ha, I get it. :)
Let‚Äôs take a moment to appreciate the film making genius that is @edgarwright http://t.co/rV5kQdJYEm
Very excited to see @m_giacchino at the Albert Hall, this Thursday. The score for Star Trek ‚Äò09 live? Yes please!!!
@DSCSDMF That was mistake number one. I don‚Äôt drink.
Some murfurqur is impersonating me on Instagram. If you are following me it, is not me, it is an ill person.
@MysteryBritExec Aw thanks Batman/Girl.
@MysteryBritExec Guess it must be tough being a film exec. All those twatty actors, ruining the fun.
@MysteryBritExec To find out about the nuts and liquor and JL? Not to keep me company?
@MysteryBritExec Okay, well if you‚Äôre as high up as you seem, can you have a word?
@curtisstigers The blindness, right?
@MysteryBritExec What an awesome dream! Apart from the liquor, I don‚Äôt drink but she could and get all tipsy and amorous.
I‚Äôm worried that I might love Jennifer Lawrence too much.
Now listening to GMF by John Grant, awesome song to ward off the ghosts, stalking London.

@devincf It bums me out though mate. Looks like a leaked private note. He‚Äôs probably full of nerves and excitement. The enemy of articulacy.
@devincf He‚Äôs an excellent human being. Cares deeply about his cast and crew and a note from him in your lunchbox can make all the diff.

Incidentally, The Odeon, Camden is opposite a certain pub, that would serve as inspiration for our third film collaboration. #TheWorldsEnd
@empiremagazine @edgarwright We did pay! We snuck in so as not to appear all la-di-da. This was pre Twitter. Public pride was a no-no.
