All great rock stars are derived from (if not the Christ archetype) then certainly the sacrificed God/Goddess. So in a way it‚Äôs a natural progression. https://t.co/cqVYapvRKg
That is the correct accent for all tweets. Twitter has a British accent. The same as Jesus. https://t.co/4hI6sdL7Vb

.@EckhartTolle. @TonyRobbins. Also learn to meditate. It changes everything. https://t.co/U3Su9njOJh
No one wants to turn their back on someone they love but it is widely accepted that unless the addict WANTS help and is WILLING to change attempts to help are counterproductive. It‚Äôs a hard truth. Your friend must surrender. https://t.co/kn0xyySH1x

Oh Liz, I am honoured to receive your first tweet. What‚Äôs next? A microwave meal? A tin of Pepsi Cola? You are a wonderful friend to addicts and people that have lost people to addiction. Try Tiktok next. But stay away from tindr. https://t.co/YOGiP33zDL
I think if you commit to the ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô life a lot of decisions evaporate as the ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô life increasingly becomes secondary to ‚Äòinner connection.‚Äô It takes bloody ages and it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs also difficult to condense into a tweet. https://t.co/UraFRdWojj
