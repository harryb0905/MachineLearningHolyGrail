@idlesband That is well bum.
@idlesband That‚Äôs disgustingly kind. Keep up the good work, generating palpable hope x
@OwenJones84 Oh just stop.
Q: Has Boris Johnson ever said anything genuinely funny? A: No. Despite this he was lazily cast as comic relief on the news, for years. Feeble fucking mess.
@MrLeeMason @RevStu Let‚Äôs hope so but also - of course he doesn‚Äôt. Fuck him.
@Mr_Peteroy Even that description is too romantic. Fuck him - he‚Äôs rubbish.
Boris Johnson is a z-grade character-comedian and embarrassingly poor  writer who deserves nothing but casual scorn or disinterest, and any journalist who still calls him ‚ÄòBoris‚Äô should be classed as a vacuous cheerleader and ignored forever. https://t.co/gB0cI4nJKU

Okay so Black Mirror S4 is up on Netflix. Hope you like it.
*Fairly* sure Black Mirror S4 will magically appear on your Netflix shelf at around midnight PST (which is 8am GMT).
@PaulieHughes Get some sleep. Think it drops at midnight California time, which is 8am GMT
@Rabinovsky @zhandlen The order I tweeted is absolutely the correct order ie: USSC / AA / CROC / HTDJ / MH / BM (also merry christmas)
So we finally decided Black Mirror S4 episode sequence is: 1. USS Callister 2. ArkAngel 3. Crocodile 4. Hang the DJ 5. Metalhead 6. Black Museum (but tbh you can watch them in whatever flippin' order you like) https://t.co/dwbiLBeYAX

@JohnJohninDevon Think of Cunk on Britain as a 2000BC-2017 Wipe
@hrtbps We started them properly with 2010 Wipe. Pretty much the biggest story that year was Cat Bin Lady.
@scottygb @janinegibson I reckon you want to email the Netflix ppl using capitals
@janinegibson @scottygb Has he not got them yet?
@janinegibson Imminent innit
@dentednerd That is *imminent*
@LeeRosevere We explored possibility of doing a 30m version but realised cramming it all in to half the runtime would be impossible madness, take longer, and prob be a bit shit.
(Just to add, Cunk on Britain covers the WHOLE of British history from the Big Bang to Brexit. In five half-hourly chunks.) [4/3]
@jamesrbuk I reckon you‚Äôll like it. I would though, wouldn‚Äôt I?
@jamesrbuk You‚Äôll live.
More good news to follow soon. That‚Äôs it! Now enjoy Christmas / life / Royal Wedding mania. [3/3]
The good news (or bad news depending on POV) is we‚Äôve just delivered CUNK ON BRITAIN (a 5-part history of our glorious nation starring Philomena) to the BBC, and that will be on *soon*. [2/3]
Got some good news and bad news. Bad news is no 2017 Wipe. Was set to do it but ran out of road. Am way behind on scripts / dev elsewhere and contrary to my optimistic delusions it turns out I can‚Äôt do 400 things at once. [1/3]

@AndyRileyish 'Needs a Chiropractic Pass' - story NEARLY works but *something* structural needs adjusting. Usually means things are a bit too complicated.
@AndyRileyish 'Harsh It Up a Bit' - to make a punchline more abrupt and brutal.
@AndyRileyish (Actually rather than 'enjoying the story' that should be 'enjoying the consequences of said contrivance')
@AndyRileyish 'Movie Moment': a plot contrivance which you'll hopefully get away because the audience is enjoying the story too much to care.
@AndyRileyish Great! Got some more...
@AndyRileyish Also 'Additing': an attempt to edit / shorten a script during which you end up adding an unhelpful amount of extra material.
@AndyRileyish Named after 10 o'Clock Live gag which made us OAPs laugh but which I delivered to utter silence on air. No one knew who the fuck Zammo was.
@AndyRileyish A 'Zammo': pop culture reference gag that works in the writers' room but plays to painful silence in front of youthful audience...

Fair dues to @DPD_UK - despite my abject whinging their driver apparently just turned around and delivered to the right place.
@tomcoates Ha! Nothing. But I almost kicked a stool in the privacy of my own kitchen.
@sheppysweet well there's that too
@charltonbrooker With this in mind I'd like to wish the souls manning the @DPD_UK @YodelOnline and @myhermes accounts a Merry Christmas.
The worst thing about courier companies - their system basically goads you into being angry with their underpaid / overworked staff.
@ChrisWaller @DPD_UK Good luck finding the number though. Just get a nationwide slush pile job with a recorded message.
@richardosman Can you do a World Cup of Shittest Courier Companies pls?
@DPD_UK It's yr bosses I blame. Guessing they ask drivers to hit insane targets, then employ a tiny social team to absorb public annoyance.
@DPD_UK We're all locked into this spiral of disappointment. You're so understaffed you have a 13 hour pile of complaints to sort thru.
@DPD_UK And I guess complaining about couriers is all part of the joy of Christmas.
@DPD_UK I guess judging by your response time there's an average wait of 15 hours before you'll reply. So I'm talking to myself here.
@DPD_UK Can I DM you the parcel number so he can turn around and actually deliver it to the specified address?
@DPD_UK Your driver just tried to deliver a parcel to the wrong address - didn't ring doorbell and sent photo of a different door
Fortunately they were busy watching a Mr Bean cartoon and just plain ignored me.
Somehow just forgot my kids are 2 &amp; 4 years old - entered room and absent-mindedly greeted them with a cheery "hey, fuckfaces!"
@MitchellSt and there was me worrying it was too much of a giveaway
Here‚Äôs a doozy. https://t.co/LqFr5KIzA1
Catching up‚Ä¶ This is making me want to get a Black Mirror comic up and running. https://t.co/c0IbGQt9PH
@HemingwaysCigar yes he will
Hey @DannyTRS have you seen this? https://t.co/2GvisjeGOq
@caroldecker you know there's some T'Pau in Black Mirror S3E4 yeah?
‚Ä¶ CHRISTMAS https://t.co/I3zcoUNUpe
MERRY... https://t.co/sDLpuKkMgF
Doing this bullshit atm https://t.co/Z75alye7Pe
@robertdolby The clientele choose the music. Maybe they‚Äôve got a dark sense of humour.
@Duckbats Glad you liked it!
Poor language skills in that last tweet from me. It should be ‚Äúfor ANYONE who likeS books and / or human beings‚Äù.

Update! We were in the 2016 Wipe edit till 4am last night. Got it down to 1'15" and counting.
@GarryCasey I am yes - it was for Halloween
Bigly bigly great https://t.co/RlEwu93JM3
Another goodie https://t.co/4L5oh6E3tk
@somebadideas it helps if you break it up with percussive little sobs
@DavidEdwards105 but of course.
@ianbrice in a way you'll get 90m anyhow as there's Cunk on Christmas directly afterwards
@mrdiscopop not that simple sadly
@tomwhite7 there are funny bits
BTW we do a rough cut *before* recording my "sofa and desk" links. We assemble it with still photos and v/o, then shoot what we need.
@MorvenCrumlish then it'll just be 7m long
We're breaking the back of the 2016 Wipe edit. Current rough cut is over 90m long though - we have to squish it into 60.
@dafrankland Shhh
It was this I was humming to you, without knowing it. https://t.co/BK6gGWIoVe
@seb_ly thank you
YES THAT WAS IT https://t.co/2WfUiRB1Qi
@colinmbradley BINGO
@simonblackwell Nope, but that sounds sort of vaguely similar
It‚Äôs either classical or from a movie soundtrack. Not the Pink Panther. Not Gymnopedie (tho it sounds sort of similar).
Am trying to identify a melancholic piece of music (piano) that sort of goes ‚Äúde-doo, de-doo, de-doo, de-doo... de-doo-doo‚Äù.

@Balthouze dunno why it says that. IMDb often a work of fiction.

Am hosting #hignfy tonight at 9pm on @BBCOne - been a quiet news week really, but we found a couple of things to talk about.
@DougStanhope Fuck, just seen this. Wish you both the best, and all the hope there is.
@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN Glad you liked it. This is the only thing that‚Äôs made me smile today.
@andynyman Well that's cheered me right up
@Jam_sponge Precisely
2016 Wipe increasingly resembling a vertical cliff face with no footholds.
Got a theory that roughly one year ago some scientists activated a secret underground stupidity accelerator the size of a fucking mountain.
Sorry, perhaps it wasn't clear: Cookie Monster is a puppet. https://t.co/nMs0A9YCEa
@Spanglor @MrKenShabby Are you fucking kidding me
@EvesonL @MrKenShabby Yes but in the good old days they'd complain by screaming into a shoe or something, the mad pricks.
@MrKenShabby Actually there's no way Cookie Monster put that on himself is there? Cookie Monster is an ENEMY and a FRAUD.
I can think of a few "robust headlines" about Michael Gove. https://t.co/OuKZz6ieST
@whosthedaddymg NOTHING
@bigjonriley @netflix We are!
@DanDepledge Glad you liked it
@joe_stone We will try to punctuate the sobs with funny dancing
@ShawnMendes Too kind, thank you
@ja2ke Yes I did - it's great
@Glinner Okay I WILL
@Glinner Has that guy just pissed himself? If so, I‚Äôm definitely watching.
Quite a few ppl saying this. https://t.co/OjCvSwlq5p
@Reaprar Yeah, but I tried the Kinect etc. Impressive at the time, but not *clearly the future* in the way this seems to be.
@michelledeidre Yes, v short ‚Äúgame‚Äù but amazing experience.
@chrisfu_1983 I like standing up and putting my head through the roof.
@LeeCarus Yes! The little robot one.
@ColinPearceUK Agreed. I was a sceptic, but agreed.
@SovereignSyre BUT WILL IT EVER BE BETTER THAN THIS? https://t.co/YYpKAmI5G9
@stevemy Haven‚Äôt yet, no.
@RyMacleod Wondering how that compares with 10p for 38 seconds of Battlezone circa 1980 or so.
@TeeSpirit 10/10 Graphics are amazing, four thumbs up
@TeeSpirit In my experience, Eve Valkyrie
‚Ä¶ the sense of presence was just downright bizarre. Call me naive but I wasn‚Äôt prepared for that.
Actually one thing that startled me most of all was playing Driveclub VR, looking round and seeing the car‚Äôs headrest behind me...
@racco Some of them can, yes.
@RyMacleod Are they? That‚Äôs daylight robbery.
@HugBoxNinja Standard
@RyMacleod A big box of free kit probably does count as a bribe doesn‚Äôt it? But what sort of self-cunting cunt would I be to say no to that?
I was sceptical of the games being any more than tech demos, but if you try Bound, and imagine a VR Mario game with similar engine‚Ä¶ well.
Anyhow, like I say ‚Äî they sent it to me, so it cost me nothing. Try before you buy. But bloody HELL that‚Äôs the future right there that is.
The Batman thing, for instance, is just remarkable. I actually had to take it off for the final scene because I was getting too freaked out.
It‚Äôs mental. It‚Äôs like DREAMING the fucking game.
‚Ä¶ I always imagined 1st-person experiences. Didn‚Äôt *occur* to me how immersive a 3rd-person game like Bound or Tethered would be.
‚Ä¶ bearing in mind this is the most basic home VR is likely to be it‚Äôs pretty mind-blowing. Also: when I used to picture VR...
It‚Äôs not perfect. There are 10 billion cables. It can be blurry. Clunky. Some things make you feel seasick. But...
‚Ä¶ It reminds me of when I first saw Doom. Or Mario 64. Or fuck it, Space Invaders. A real sense that ‚Äúeverything just changed‚Äù.
‚Ä¶ but none of those really prepared me for the barrage of HOLY SHIT moments I‚Äôve had trying out the PSVR thingy...
‚Ä¶ also I‚Äôve tried out a Game of Thrones promotional thingy and a Stranger Things promotional thingy, both of which were v impressive...
I‚Äôve tried Oculus Rift a few times. Eg @PaintingP used one to create a virtual ‚ÄòTucker‚Äôs‚Äô for San Junipero prior to the shoot...
(I often use micro gaming-sessions as a reward when writing‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIf I finish the next two scenes by 11pm I can play games for 30m‚Äù, etc)
Sony sent me a PSVR headset and a bunch of games, which I‚Äôve been trying out on-and-off in-between writing and general tinkering...
Some quick off-the-top-of-my head thoughts on VR coming, so look away now if bored shitless by your INEVITABLE FUTURE
@mrbiffo NOW MAKE BROWN MIRROR

@CallumMyers1250 @blackmirror This one's got a direct link to White Bear. But really these are separate tales.

@intrepidleeloo It is! But some tracks are only showing up in the UK...
@C_W_Writes MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
@sambaintv @blackmirror TA YEAH?!
@freelanceND Owen was particularly delighted we cleared that one
@scapey Amazing. I love it.
@Mr_Fisch93 Would at least take the trial run
@TCKRsystems Ta, it's good to know this stuff. Recently discovered the word 'fortnight' baffles Americans for instance
@KaylCobb @jeffkoyen @decider Thanks! Much appreciated
@jeffkoyen @KaylCobb @decider Gawd no. Word was "blackmailer". Would've thought that obvious! Please adjust accordingly.

@edgarwright TALES OF THE CONSTIPATED
@edgarwright That‚Äôs episode two.
@RAStap01 How about gases?
@edgarwright Episode one: a man falls in love with his toilet but can only express his feelings by shitting and pissing into its mouth.
@edgarwright Because they remind me of toilet seats.
@caitlinmoran I HATE THAT YOU THINK THAT

(Not that I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs on a par with The Truman Show btw. I mean what is?)
You didn‚Äôt ask, but IMO thinking Black Mirror hates technology is a bit like thinking The Truman Show hates cameras.
@LeeRosevere GOOD SPOT I‚Äôll add it now
Here, I made an expanded San Junipero playlist, inc some tracks we didn‚Äôt / couldn‚Äôt use for various reasons: https://t.co/Sq0nrwJObX
@RyMacleod 200 POINTS TO YOU
Kind of distraught no-one‚Äôs noticed the cheeky placement of the arcade game 'Time Crisis' in San Junipero yet.

@DaftLimmy Why thank you https://t.co/4RzzKHKhZn
@lilyallen @blackmirror thank you - v kind
@jonronson @Tim_Pilcher Think it was probably a sub. I‚Äôve mentioned ‚ÄòShamed‚Äô in loads of i/vs, honest!
The new series of @blackmirror will magically appear on Netflix at around 8am UK time. Thanks to everyone involved in every aspect of it.

Popping up on @BBCNewsnight in a bit to talk Black Mirror and tech and that. FACT: one of the cameramen is wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt.
@DaftLimmy ONLY NUMBER ONE CHRONOLOGICALLY

@stuartmillar159 @janinegibson @broderick @imbadatlife where do you stand on Marmite added to browning mince?
@broderick @janinegibson @imbadatlife You are hearing this from lost, desperate people who don't know their own minds.
@janinegibson @broderick @imbadatlife Way too much Marmite for beginners. Like drinking a bottle of Tabasco and pulling a face. A cheap con.
@jamesrbuk don't spoil it
@ZippyGonzales Don't know. Think it's secreted by bats.
I fucking love Marmite. I'm 'Hard Marmite'. Pretty much one whole jar per piece of toast. Just smashed on there, glass and all. MARMITE.
(That's not a joke btw, there really is a scene with some Marmite in it. Not being fed to a robot or anything like that, mind.)
There's a scene involving Marmite in a London-set episode of the new Black Mirror series. Meant to be near-future. NOW A UTOPIAN PIPE DREAM.

@philski68 @Herring1967 I know you don't mean this but nothing crappy about it! Incredible what they pulled off.
@Herring1967 tbf as long as C4 keep making Catastrophe I'm not cross with them.
@ZeRootOfAllEvil @Herring1967 Someone made a black mirror cake in the first ep of the current GBBO series...
@Herring1967 be good to see more present day comedies as visually inventive as The Goodies too. Or maybe I'm just not aware of them.
@Herring1967 Ecky Thump starring The Rock
@Herring1967 Yep! Just going to DM you actually
@Herring1967 I still remember when The Goodies went to ITV
@Herring1967 BM wasn't poached: C4 told us we'd need to find US co-funding to continue the show. So we did. And then they pulled out.

In related news, v pleased with upcoming season of new Black Mirror (final touches happening now). First peeks should be unveiled soonish.

I didn't take my own pen, because as far as I can tell I'm not completely fucking delusional.
Just put a cross in a box; first time I've written something by hand in about six months.

There's still the end-of-year show, mind...
We &amp; BBC wanted to make this happen too, but Black Mirror is all-absorbent at present... https://t.co/wt4HPwUMAD

Haven't seen Top Gear yet. Did it contain spoilers? (This is a car joke)
@DaftLimmy JOB DONE
@DaftLimmy Actually I reckon set yourself a five paragraph limit on the story. That'll show it who's boss.
@DaftLimmy Have the dad at the soft play try to move a shit from his arse to the toilets using his mind?
@DaftLimmy Like straining to shit. It'll slip out once sufficiently brewed.

If you're stuck for shit to watch, shove the Philomena Cunk special down your eyeholes: https://t.co/pzWSvIlAmp
Here‚Äôs #CunkOnShakespeare on iPlayer starring @missdianemorgan https://t.co/Kp82XtPSd7
@JTBickers Maybe wouldn‚Äôt be printed in the Radio Times
So yeah, just a few minutes till #CunkOnShakespeare on BBC2. I wrote this tweet with a quill.
A little 'Easter egg' awaits anyone who switches to BBC2 just *before* 10pm for tonight's Cunk on Shakespeare https://t.co/Ymor833ojD
@harryhenrysmall Sadly no, too busy on Black Mirror duties
Philomena Cunk tackles Shakespeare in a one-off special tonight at 10pm on BBC2: https://t.co/Ymor833ojD
Cunk on Shakespeare is on BBC2 TOMORROW at 10pm you BASTARDS https://t.co/xsSLKMKViP
Oi it's Philomena Cunk vs Shakespeare in CUNK ON SHAKESPEARE, this Weds, 10pm, BBC2 https://t.co/dBWYDxpQZ8

@iainlee Yep yep. DM me...
@trionkidnapper All human progress is to blame, ultimately
@trionkidnapper How?
@trionkidnapper You wouldn‚Äôt see that in your timeline unless you were following Radio Times to begin with.
@trionkidnapper Which tweet?
@nielsencs Sentimental reasons
@trionkidnapper How?

@courseofleeches Not a legal expert, but reckon if Stewart Lee is allowed to like Marvel comics I'm allowed to look forward to Star Wars.
Then @RadioTimes spoils it with one tweet. Almost as bad as this DVD cover: https://t.co/x1ZO3mPR8O
@DannyGipson @RadioTimes Nah, I've got two kids under 5 and zero spare time. But thanks for assessing my priorities for me.
Months I'd managed to avoid Star Wars spoilers. MONTHS.
@RadioTimes What's your next trick? Telling me what I'm getting for Christmas?
@RadioTimes Thanks for spoiling a film I haven't seen yet, you clickbaity shitshovellers.
@kabdoun87  But feel free to continue to watch on YouTube.
@kabdoun87 Netflix is available in Egypt, I believe, so that‚Äôs Black Mirror sorted. For the rest of it ‚Äî I guess import DVDs?

@Timewarp_JF Nope, it's been that way for over 20 years
This guy has invented a dialect that sounds like Scottish, Irish, Russian and Klingon combined. But not Geordie. https://t.co/zn5QlMxWeO
@tkingdoll @ellardent the BBC tell you not to do it
In fact the ban makes it easier to unfairly misrepresent MPs - cos you're prevented from depicting the reality of what they actually said.
It's not like it benefits any party. We had to cut gags about both Corbyn and Cameron recently cos they relied on HoC footage, for instance.
@EmmaGritt @derek_acorah That's a good idea - can he do all the voices?
Maybe we should build a set and cast actors to play each MP for reconstructions. Like when Sky did the Michael Jackson trial.
@tkingdoll yep
@tkingdoll yep
Also it's inconsistent. HIGNFY can't use clips from the House of Commons, whereas This Week can - with funny music dubbed on top.
Commons footage ban means they can't broadcast episodes of The Daily Show over here if they use clips from HoC.
We tried getting round it once by using footage from the Commons website. Got away with that for like a week.
The ban on UK comedy / satirical shows using Commons footage is just ridiculous...

Writing a script with autocorrect on is like having to repeatedly restate your name to a deaf official. "It's ARQUETTE, not MARQUETTE‚Äù etc
@caraellison I think the answer is to attempt to ignore the inner critic, which is impossible.
@caraellison I could rarely tell which columns ppl wd like. Almost every week I‚Äôd think ‚Äúthis is the shittest thing I‚Äôve ever done‚Äù.
@noofs sounds odd as we're not filming today. Will fwd this message to someone though.
@djapn @spleenal Kind of did that in Touch of Cloth 2...
@ms_molly_vog When he was young, our eldest laughed like a drain at news footage of mass-murderer Anders Brevik. Fortunately tastes change..
@ms_molly_vog YES YOU BETTA
@ms_molly_vog Soon you‚Äôll only use your TV to screen endless reruns of Peppa Pig anyway. That‚Äôs my prediction...
At a guess I‚Äôd say it‚Äôll happen every Friday for a few weeks. That‚Äôs how time works.
This happened last Friday too. I just didn‚Äôt know it then.
I have just been informed that if you switch your TV to Gold tonight you can watch Darkplace, Nathan Barley and Jam, all in a row.
@AlCampbeII I dare you to dub in a tiny whispered voice on a rear speaker that quietly informs the viewer they are losing their mind.
CUNK ON SHAKESPEARE is a real thing that's coming: https://t.co/Z6n3F9Q758

@KayBurley dammit; yet another trick dogs have mastered before me ;-)
@martinkent77 it is coming back, just a bit of a wait while focus on black mirror for a bit
@katypearce Good luck...
@limertilly yeah I'll post the Spotify playlist later
@amberkraken There was a caption warning of that in advance. Actually recalled the tapes to get that put on too...
If you missed #2015Wipe, it's repeated on BBC2 tonight at 10pm. Or at any o'clock on the iPlayer.

@missdianemorgan @doofwizard She's all over that shit
So #2015Wipe starts IN A MO - 9pm on BBC2. Viewers in Wales and NI have to wait around like arseholes for an hour longer, mind.
@dudleyplatypus A Cadbury's Despair
Tonight's #2015Wipe contains dead lions, Clarkson, Jon Snow, epic struts, Cunk &amp; Shitpeas, Donald Trump, Corbyn, horror, war, etc etc etc
It's been quite a hefty sort of year, this one. WE'LL TRY TO KEEP IT LIGHT, YEAH? #2015Wipe
#2015Wipe occurs at 9pm TONIGHT on BBC2 (10pm in Wales / NI) https://t.co/JXX3XqPlCa
Good riddance to 2015 ‚Äî watch #2015Wipe: TONIGHT, 9pm, BBC2. https://t.co/Vde7LFnVU2

@DaftLimmy Can I see that video of the spider walking around on your face please? I want to retweet it again right now.
SPIDER FACT: spiders can crawl into your ear at night, clamber inside your mind and dance around on your fondest memories.
Just encountered a spider. Which means that wherever and whoever you are, there's probably one near you right now.

@leatherlife29 you are terrifying

@garyclipson oh I haven't resigned
@BeatnikBrian Ach but it's just me being a tit whining about a first world problem while in a foul mood cos I missed a train
I reckon that's enough social media for one millennium.
@Independent On reflection I also apologise for 24% of the remaining 25%. Basically everything bar the confetti line. Twitter sends me nuts.
@saabcrow I think that's prob true to an extent
@Independent Ok that was *slightly* over the top. Not a great morning. Apologies for about 75% of that. But I still like the confetti line.
@Independent is this your business model now? What a pitiful shitsheet. I wouldn't rip your paper to confetti for a rat's wedding.

@DaftLimmy Ooh I was ZX80, Spectrum, Amstrad CPC 6128, longish gap, Megadrive, SNES, then every console bar the Saturn.
Some sort of joke about Cameron and 'Elite' but it's so fucking niche I can't be arsed
I reckon Nick Clegg had a Dragon 32. Cameron had five BBC Model Bs stacked on top of each other.
I was always more ZX Spectrum than Commodore 64.
And the entire team, especially archive corner headed by @SamTerroni - they have to watch EVERYTHING. Pity them.

Good point. RT @adilray if Muslim he'd face terror charges.
Too late to put that video in Election Wipe. Just as well. For pre-ballot balance, I‚Äôd have to add a disclaimer saying bullets don‚Äôt hurt.
Once you get over the initial shock what's remarkable about that video is that he's speaking, presumably, to a stranger he's only just met.

@LauraDickens90 IT WAS ON THURSDAYS YEAH
Maybe if Huw Edwards punched a producer they'd cancel the remaining episodes of the news.
Last normal #WeeklyWipe of series tonight, BBC2, 10pm. Contains more footage of Ian Beale than all previous episodes combined.
@anacanapana Loophole! It‚Äôs footage taken from the Westminster website, not from broadcast news. As such, I believe it‚Äôs exempt.
@SteveLloydF1 We‚Äôll live.
Final #WeeklyWipe of the series, TONIGHT, BBC2, 10pm. Featuring #EELive, The Oscars, Cunk &amp; Shitpeas, Morgana, Moments of Wonder &amp; more.
@ArianeSherine Especially if the subject is ‚Äútables of contents‚Äù.
@Holo_drone No, we lobbed that in on Wednesday morning. It was only a clip / audio change.
@benjamin_cook I did actually run down a corridor just a moment ago to check on something to do with the Green Party thing.
@Avi_Avikesh Live Broadcasting is fun because it‚Äôs terrifying, atmospheric and over in a blur. Pre-recorded allows you to do more things.
@benjamin_cook About 6pm on the night of transmission I think ‚Äî probably a shot change or something simple like that.
@EthanRunt No because the online and dub are done on Wednesdasy, and we have to start cutting the next week‚Äôs show on Thursdays).
(INTERESTING I‚Äôm sure)
(Tuesday is the night we put together the final offline cut of the show, see. Links etc shot on Mondays).
Actually hang on. May have thought of a way to squeeze a clip of it in.
That Green Party interview happened just too late for this week‚Äôs Weekly Wipe.
@mr_phrenologist @iamjohnoliver Or maybe two shows dealing with current affairs in the same week will naturally have some overlap.

Was Richard Blackwood holding the same bouquet that shot Den? #EELive
On #WeeklyWipe at 10pm on BBC2, we exclusively reveal who didn‚Äôt kill Lucy Beale #EELive
Anyway there‚Äôs a new #WeeklyWipe tonight on BBC2 at 10, immediately after that EastEnders flashback episode on BBC1.
Ian Beale has a severe luck allergy.
I hope Lofty comes back too.
Lots of ppl correcting me on that score thanks to some errant Rick Astley.
It was pointed out to me today all the EastEnders background music is from 1985 #EELive
@unemployedclown @emmerdale and the sheep
@JamBar1976 We‚Äôre across that
I like how the scenes round Nick Cotton‚Äôs death house seem to be shot in black and white #EELive
Tonight! New #WeeklyWipe ‚Äî BBC2, 10pm. Including Putin, The Voice, Miliband v Fink, Pink Bus, Cunk, a glimpse at EastEnders, etc etc...
Looks like Clarendon is the winner. Lots of votes for ‚ÄòRizla‚Äô though.

This is your last call for #WeeklyWipe which starts at 10pm on BBC2 and which this week has been filmed in stunning 2D.
@almondosfunk actually worried it was for a moment there
Probably supposed to use a hashtag aren't I? Like this: #WeeklyWipe   Still haven't got the hang of 2015.
Viewers in Northern Ireland get the show an hour and twenty minutes later, because the BBC hates them. Or the show. Not sure which.
Tonight! Weekly Wipe! 10pm BBC2! Includes jokes, footage, Wolf Hall, a major revamp of Top Gear, and a big shitting arse*.  * Not included.
Weekly Wipe returns tonight: BBC2 at 10pm.

@FrizFrizzle I think you'll find we decided that about a week ago. Sorry.
@RottenTomatoes Black Mirror is a C4 show, not a BBC show, so isn't affected by any 'purge'
@RottenTomatoes no it doesn't.
Nonsense http://t.co/LZrImWaiLH
Them co-writers being @bencaudell, @alanconnor, @danielmaier, @JasonHazeley, @gralefrit and @Jam_sponge [2/2]
Btw, if you laughed at anything in 2014 Wipe, there's a good chance one of our co-writers came up with it... [1/2]
@bswud But I can see if you're unfamiliar with the show that might not be clear.
@bswud It was a contributor piece, which I thought was made pretty clear. Adam edits his own stuff, as does, say Limmy or Cassette Boy.
@bswud I am also not Philomena Cunk in this financial report: http://t.co/EzjpxP5xQS
@bswud I didn't interview anyone at the BoE cos I'm a twat &amp; also cos I didn't author the piece you're saying I didn't research properly.
@nathhooper because I'm an idiot and would be a disaster
If you liked (or didn't) the Adam Curtis 'Oh Dear' piece in 2014 Wipe, there's a trailer for his next thing here: http://t.co/y7nC9UpOfZ
Actually 2014 Wipe is repeated this Saturday, not Sunday. I only said it was Sunday because I'm a fucking dimwit.
@APlasticPaddy doh. Thanks.
2014 Wipe is on iPlayer: http://t.co/adKJ0DPyYQ - also repeated this Sunday at  10.45pm on BBC2. New series of Weekly Wipe end of Jan.
@caraellison JePlayer?
Tonight! 10pm! BBC2! 2014 Wipe! Featuring @Cassetteboy, Adam Curtis, Philomena Cunk, Mr. Barry Shitpeas and  @BlockheadsPage! In colour!
@jounwin Smidgen more than that
@jounwin more than a tad
Tonight's 2014 Wipe (BBC2, 10pm) contains an inordinate amount of music.
2014 Wipe - BBC2 tonight at 10pm. Covers everything from ISIS to Dapper Laughs. Contains @Cassetteboy, Adam Curtis, Shitpeas and Cunk.
@jounwin Whatever it is, it looks like it's going to come to life at midnight and scuttle away and hide.
@suttonnick right after 'were you paying attention?' too

I'm stuck in an edit but I believe Mr. Jon Hamm is on @laurenlaverne's show right now yapping about next Tuesday's Black Mirror Xmas, etc...
Make Me Eat Cake
Make Me Despondent
I mean, the plans for actual programmes sound good. But those category headings are just baffling.
@johnplunkett149 Where would Boys From the Blackstuff go?
A future in which people click a tab labelled "Make Me Think" sounds weirdly chilling.
New BBC3 plans separate drama &amp; comedy into strands called 'Make Me Think' &amp; 'Make Me Laugh'. Drama never funny, comedies never thoughtful?
@ms_molly_vog Yeah but such a dumb thing to get so annoyed about. Ah well.
Still annoyed to have got so annoyed earlier. Twitter should have a setting that lets you automatically hold all tweets in limbo for 45m.
‚Äú@BBCNews: Henry vacuum cleaner nativity scene assembled in Essex http://t.co/lySR1HPI2B http://t.co/DybKjNEKR1‚Äù Now THAT is news.
Unwise of Mr. Brand to tweet phone numbers, whoever they belong to.
Gawd that was odd. Got v annoyed, then v self-righteous, now calmed down &amp; feel a bit daft. Twitter is bad for the brain.
@VictoriaPeckham How dare they promote my TV shows.
@VictoriaPeckham Haven't seen that one yet. SOUNDS LIKE A PHOTOSHOPPED LIE.
@UncannyVal Yeah but I wouldn't expect to be paid for a promotional Q&amp;A. I was being cheeky there as annoyed.
Ed of @RadioTimes says they'll have a whip-round for @AnthonyNolan so even tho I feel a bit guilty for tantrum, something nice happened.
@VictoriaPeckham That's a first.
@VictoriaPeckham I know that's standard practice when running columns by non-writers, but I'm not a non-writer. At least not intentionally.
@VictoriaPeckham Call me precious, but it's laid out like col written by me, which it isn't. They'd prev asked me to do this &amp; I said no.
@RTBenPreston Okay, apology accepted. Now will the @RadioTimes hold a little whip-round for @AnthonyNolan? It IS Christmas...
@RTBenPreston I don't blame your writer btw, who clearly thought I knew what the arrangement was.
@RTBenPreston More disappointed than annoyed. Always trusted the Radio Times.
@timmaughan @RadioTimes Nah just came up with that figure; God knows what they normally pay.
@RTBenPreston I wouldn't expect to be shown it prior to publication. I would expect to at least be told plan was to run as 'authored column'
@alan_mackie Well yes.
@RTBenPreston A) It's laid out in such a way as to mislead the reader; B) I would never have agreed to a 'ghostwritten' arrangement.
Never mind @RadioTimes, I've donated it on your behalf. Feel free to match if you're feeling charitable for Xmas. http://t.co/y5rg9qotVr
@RadioTimes How can I be sure Steven Moffat actually said that?
It's not the fault of their writer, btw, who was just doing their job.
Here's an idea, I'll charge @RadioTimes ¬£2000 for that bylined article, and they can donate 'my fee' to the @AnthonyNolan trust.
Oh yeah. They didn't pay me either.
Am genuinely v annoyed with @RadioTimes though. I turned down request to write article for them; they made it look like I wrote one anyway.
@HugoGye @RadioTimes What, in the print edition?
Latest @RadioTimes contains a phone q&amp;a with me repackaged as a first-person article without my knowledge or permission. #1stWorldProblems
@HadleyFreeman Pretty sure I actually smiled.
@StephenKing Thank you. Am a big big fan; delighted you're enjoying it.
@Keltoe @PeteOlympian No but you have to keep typing. Those are the rules.
@PeteOlympian @Keltoe Type, continue typing, carry on typing.

@gracedent It's mainly just shots of people eating gingerbread
Here, look at BLACK MIRROR: WHITE CHRISTMAS, Dec 16th, C4 https://t.co/8UqbUankUN #BlackMirrorXmas
@Jam_sponge @ManMadeMoon That's genuinely made me wonder what happens if you project more than one 3D film onto one screen at a time.
@ManMadeMoon I reckon people would still turn up to watch four different ones projected simultaneously onto one screen.
@somebadideas Quite possibly. International sales always used to be a mystery to me but have been paying more attention recently.
@somebadideas Kind of you to say so. Dunno why it's no longer on Amazon; someone somewhere may be renegotiating something or gawd knows what
@somebadideas That is well bum.
@danaruadh Sounds almost festive.
@somebadideas Mind you I've got no idea how many of the references in Dead Set make sense over there.
@somebadideas Dead Set was on IFC and also, I was pretty sure, was on Amazon video or iTunes US for a while.
@PaynieLF Oh I mean Netflix US.
@CrDoire You have no idea how often I've had to explain that joke is indeed the point of the title.
Light and shade, and all that.
WIsh they'd put A Touch of Cloth on Netflix too.
@sneakyleprecaun Yep.
@CrDoire I'm often just standing here, but with nothing to say.
@shcot_t_e Yep, BBC2, TX date to be confirmed soon I think.
Bit rich me lecturing America on getting the channel name right when I can't understand US TV listings *at all*. Looks like Excel to me.
@onapedalstool Oh fiddlesticks. I think I mean The Audience Network on DirecTV or something similar. THAT'LL TEACH ME TO LECTURE A NATION.
@NerdcoreBlog Watch this space.
BTW I believe you Americans can see the forthcoming Black Mirror White Christmas special on 25th Dec on DirecTV.
@londoncalledme Nope, in the US it's on DirecTV and now Netflix.
Last RT is right. We do have a channel called 'Dave'.
Downton Abbey / Broadchurch = ITV. Utopia / Black Mirror = Channel 4. Doctor Who / Sherlock etc etc: BBC.
The BBC is generally great and everything, but not all British TV shows are 'BBC' shows by default.
Charmed several of you Americans seem to be discovering Black Mirror now it's on US Netflix. But *ahem* it's not a BBC show. It's Channel 4.

@doritosyndrome @DaftLimmy Haven't written any novels. The rest of it - whatever it be - is out.

@elhefe82 oh I've made a few notes. But come November I find they don't make sense
@VictoriaPeckham I'll try but can never quite tell if it's funny until someone else confirms it, so fingers crossed.

@CChad72 I'm separating Westminster from the entire known universe. So you were wrong about that and also, by your own admission, the rest.

@ms_molly_vog I did once spray wasp killer up a Hoover nozzle in a desperate bid to kill a spider therein
@ms_molly_vog I just don't trust the Hoover method. Not permanent enough.
@DaftLimmy I typed psychological and the phone autocorrected it. But I guess pathological covers it too.
@DaftLimmy It would require a pathological leap so vast I reckon I'd see colours differently and taste noises etc on the other side
@Mullane45 @nickytc if it's any consolation I went to Australia once and only saw one mind-manglingly huge and probably deadly spider.
@DaftLimmy It's not biting I'm scared of. It's the shape and the way they move. Their whole existence. Pure animal instinct.

@girlonetrack or sleep in a string hammock so they mistake you for a rival spider having a nap
@girlonetrack Conkers. Vinegar. Housecat.
@girlonetrack it's mainly for spraying round CCTV cameras so they won't spin webs and dangle around obscuring the crime
@girlonetrack okay well that's good. Still haven't got round to booking in. I had a can of Spider X once - not sure it did anything

@EosChater well that's not going to help
What I need is a pair of augmented reality goggles that airbrush out spiders before I can see them.
And deliberately squinting so my vision's a blur if I go into a room that seems 'likely' to have a spider in it.
We're into spider season now and I still haven't seen one this month. But then I am habitually walking up and down stairs with eyes closed.

Sad break up song for Scotland: http://t.co/JLZ8QPAwMJ #indyref
Thinking of compiling a Spotify playlist of sad break-up songs for Scotland.

Okay now we're in a sort of visual bidding war.
That's the front cover sorted.
@giagia These kind of experiments are a slippery slope that ultimately lead to you becoming the family in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
I'm just enjoying the bit where the cashier is about to scan Mr. Cornflakes Box when the 2yo cuts me dead by asking for Mr. Jelly again.
Someone puts him in a trolley and wheels him towards the checkout. He'll be taken home and eaten!
Then I realise I've got a good plot point coming up: at the supermarket Mr. Cornflakes Box is mistaken for a normal pack of cereal.
Figured Mr. Cornflakes Box would eat eggs. So he has scrambled eggs. Finishes all the eggs in the fridge. Then heads into town to buy more.
Quickly run into difficulty at the point where Mr. Cornflakes Box has to eat his breakfast.
Once he's done laughing he says, "I'm funny." I call his bluff; start telling a story about Mr. Cornflakes Box in the style of the Mr. Men.
"Read Mr. Jelly", says our 2yo. I start reading Mr. Jelly. Immediately: "I don't want Mr. Jelly, I want Mr. Cornflakes Box." Then he laughs.
I like to think it's dead people trying to call you from the afterlife.

The sum total of my parenting knowledge so far is this: babies are a bit on the needy side.
Dr. Seuss is no Spike Milligan.
It had gone.
Then I left it there, and took the baby upstairs. I returned to work (writing late at night). Hours later I went back to look at it again.
I looked at it for a while, quite close up, to see if it would help me get over the phobia. One of the biggest spiders I've ever seen.
So I dropped a heavy book on it, like a murderous coward. Then I stood on the book. Later, I moved the book. There it lay, big as a dog...
But as far as my arachnophobe brain is concerned, that'd be like trying to disarm an AK-47 toting spree killer using a bendy straw.
An addendum to last night's spider encounter. I know what I should've done. I should've scooped it up with a glass and a bit of paper.
@missdianemorgan Shaken not turd.
@girlonetrack @zsllondonzoo RIGHT that's IT. I'm going to TRY IT.
I reckon even spiders are scared of spiders, which is why they often look like they're trying to run away from themselves.
@girlonetrack @zsllondonzoo I think I'm ready for that. Did it actually, genuinely work? Could you eat a spider now?
If you cut open a spider it's just full of other spiders. And if you cut open those spiders: more spiders. Right down to sub-atomic level.

I should add that the baby was sleeping soundly. It's the first time I've truly deafened myself by screaming on the inside.
Just experienced interesting clash of instincts. Climbing stairs holding 3-week-old baby; unexpectedly encountered huge spider halfway up.

Essentially there's nothing stopping a UK Daily Show, but the Wipe 'format' isn't conducive to that kind of nightly volume...
@opq1 ¬£¬£¬£
... It's a very dense show in other words. To do a *much* longer run we'd prob have to cut back on the number of sections I do per ep...
... Our show is v diff beast and is chiefly assembled in edit suites throughout the week. We prune away about 25% of each item as we go...
... Something like Daily Show must have huge team of researchers, writers, producers etc to generate several new mins of material nightly...
... You have to factor in time it takes to watch &amp; sift through hours of news footage etc before you can write a section, for instance...
... a bigger team, more contribs etc etc. To produce the material we currently do takes 7 days flat out and often means long nights etc...
To answer another question, we could do a longer run than 5 eps if commissioned to do so, but for a really long run we'd need...
@KevinUnitt no, it's a 7-day week which often involves working till 3am, and I have a family now which I'd quite like to see now and then.
Anyway so tonight there's new Cunk &amp; Shitpeas on Sherlock, The Jump &amp; The Bridge, new Limmy, new Stanhope blah blah lazy blah
@PSNWorldOfHurt What do you think commissioning means?
We chiefly do the comp for the positive viewer feedback. "@[redacted] fucking hate it when people do that. Lazy. I will not be watching."
We do 5 regular eps then a comp ep because that's what we're commissioned to do, btw. So the 'new' stuff is on the house. THAT'S MY SPIN.
@HenryT yes
Tonight's #WeeklyWipe is a comp of previous bits from me. But just to enrage and confuse you, there are also a fair few new bits lobbed in.
@missdianemorgan @AlCampbeII oddly enough I reckon that's precisely how we'd look as FIFA playable character versions of ourselves
@PoppyDelbridge aye aye
@AlCampbeII @missdianemorgan Call yourself a director? Shittest framing ever. #boo #cunt
@PoppyDelbridge minutes basically. Due date 26th.
@capriceyo I don't believe either of those examples are homophobic so we'll have to agree to disagree.
@capriceyo I think you may be confusing the piece we did with an imaginary one you want to condemn.
RIP Georgina Henry http://t.co/Oqac9cmKGp
@RealBobMortimer That's the most revolting horror movie I've ever just been forced to see in my mind's eye.
Serious tweet. Mixed UK &amp; Thai / Cambodian heritage - or know someone who is? There must be a match out there: http://t.co/imFpMvwwYC
Here, see if you can endure the latest #WeeklyWipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/46qx4GSIMB
@RealTroyAndrews No. In fact we'll put her in 20x more often, just to keep you away. You're fired as a viewer. Conversation terminated.
Tonight's #WeeklyWipe is on v. soon on BBC2: at 10pm, so get your act together. Contains all kinds of shit flying at you at breakneck speed.
@sinisterkid16 Ha. Just realised I took that joke seriously. I am thick.
@sinisterkid16 Final episodes were broadcast last week on BBC4.
@RealBobMortimer haha. I'd definitely watch a Rasmus spinoff where he just ruins case after case
@RealBobMortimer Season 3 will consist of nothing but them both staring mutely at slightly different walls.
@andrewareoff that's in too
@johnsweeneyroar Not this time I'm afraid
@johnsweeneyroar We sure are
In tonight's #WeeklyWipe (BBC2 10pm): Scarlett Johansson, that Hive ad, gays in Russia, Shitpeas, Limmy- &amp; Philomena Cunk meets Will Hutton.
@Paulcasson12 No
@DyronWilkie My high score is 5
@MatthewAustin69 That'd come in handy
Anyway. #WeeklyWipe - tonight 10pm BBC2. Inc. gays in Russia, Scarlett Johansson, Jude Law, Cunk, Peas, Limmy and that fucking Hive advert.
@ObiWanShinobee simply can't help you there I'm afraid
@Cadrieu I do try to include three or four non-swearwords in every episode.
@gralefrit @danielmaier @JasonHazeley @bencaudell We're all on the third album together. Like the Traveling Wilburys.
To answer a question often asked, we *deliberately* bleep me and no-one else on the show to give me a bit of a cartoon 'Yosemite Sam' air.
We forgot to bleep one instance of me saying the f-word on tonight's Weekly Wipe. So we're recalling it and pasting it on with glue.
@Eastmad yep will update again soon
@philiplarkin There's a lot of disco and the Game of Thrones theme.
This week Philomena Cunk meets Will Hutton.
And that's this Thursday's Weekly Wipe picture locked. Quite a varied soundtrack this week.
@brettjanes It should be on there as a PDF
@leighhaynesuk Take it that applies to the entire production team, yeah?
With all the ads and songs the SuperBowl = world's most expensive variety sketch show, intercut with stormtroopers playing sarcastic rugby.
@Ross4291 wait and see
@BlackburnJA Either or both.
Think you might get to see me sing too.
@EosChater we'll just hit it with a breeze  block then
@taggart_stewart Five regular episodes
Anyhow, on THIS Thursday's Weekly Wipe: Scarlett Johansson, Angry Birds, gay rights &amp; the Winter Olympics, Shitpeas, Cunk, Limmy, Yapp etc.
@charliewhite20 http://t.co/g3HW7ETSS1
@Kevro53 Yep, Limmy's in this week and v good too.
@robertflorence It's funny cos it's true.
@PED7 Not yet. Haven't had a day off since Xmas day.
@BenryPenryRenry We make FIVE. And then a sixth.
This coming Thursday is a regular episode, mind. We're just finishing the rough cut now. Then tomorrow morning we shoot my links.
Luckily we have some new unseen stuff that didn't get edited in time to put in this one eg Cunk &amp; Peas on Sherlock. So there's that.
Why do we make five episodes followed by a comp? Because that's as many as we're paid to make.
This coming Thursday's Weekly Wipe is sort of the last in the series, followed by comp show. Telling you now so you can complain in advance.
I'd have watched Philip Seymour Hoffman in anything. Absolutely anything. RIP.
@ptwmalone YES IT WAS
The A40 would be more ten times more fun if it was called the Hooray 40.
@laurenlaverne I still flatly and stubbornly refuse to believe. I've sort of committed to this skepticism now. No budging.
@laurenlaverne @nickjfrost If you're using a smartphone, and I bet you are, I don't believe you CAN touchtype. LIAR.
@donal_mcg back next week
@laurenlaverne @nickjfrost You can't be making eye contact AND typing unless you ARE him and are therefore seeing your own reflection.
Here's last night's #WeeklyWipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/1yXLvSBULH
Oh yeah, viewers in Wales get shat on. It's on after some rugby bullshit for you at 11.20 or so. #WeeklyWipe.
Not that I'm trying to sound like an advert or anything.
Tonight on #WeeklyWipe, wild man Bieber, Philomena Cunk finds out how computers work and we examine The Jump. Because why not? BBC2 at 10pm.
@WardMagic we're covering that too
@michaelleung I know. I'd quite like him if it wasn't for that.
Advance warning that tonight's #WeeklyWipe may contain traces of Bieber. 10pm, BBC2 - it'll be waiting for you.
@stephenfry Pics or it didn't happen.
@brettjanes Scripts for first series are on the DVD I think.
Tonight: #WeeklyWipe on BBC2 at 10pm. Contains whippersnapper Justin Bieber, The Jump, so-called Twitter 'trolls' and some wet toilet paper.
@JasonHazeley To be fair I think there was just some mix-up in getting them the script on time last week / few weeks, prob at our end.
@JasonHazeley They get the final script on Weds morn at about the same time I'm burbling it into a mic.
Deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers: hopefully the recent Weekly Wipe subtitling issue should be sorted for this week's show.
@magbrish Best answer
@virago_femme So, what, we should tailor everything so presumptuous viewers can't leap to conclusions? Fuck that for a game of conkers.
@Jam_sponge 500 POINTS DEDUCTED
@gdonlon To be honest, that wasn't a response I was expecting.
@virago_femme Who says they're working class? They both speak using their natural accents.
Q: Given the opportunity, would a necrophile fuck a ghost?
@virago_femme Also, there IS a thick middle-class character. He hosts the show.
@virago_femme Barry Shitpeas = hack comic, while Philomena was first introduced as a "cupcake blogger".
Eat the latest Weekly Wipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/szTPeXdwtC
Yeah, viewers in Northern Ireland get #WeeklyWipe a bit later. Blame geography. Also delays it going on iPlayer.
Not long till #WeeklyWipe (10pm BBC2), which tonight contains something possibly weirder than last week's Edward Penishands footage.
Wish Justin Bieber had got himself arrested at a more convenient time for Weekly Wipe schedule. Now we have to feature him next week too.
@wesleymead Not sure -- will ask
@EvaWiseman Tell her, she's this-a-way: @missdianemorgan
Tonight! #WeeklyWipe on BBC2! 10pm! Inc political scandals, Corrie death, gay weather, Bieber, Cunk, Shitpeas, Yapp, Limmy, Stanhope &amp; more.
@Charliecondou @LucyGannon2 Even I did a double take for a moment there.
In cab whose driver has Star Trek red alert sound effect assigned to each satnav announcement. It's like being in a space dogfight.
@lukewestaway Arf arf. Beguiling twirl on the Segway thingy as well. Much enjoyed in the edit.
Here's the brand new #WeeklyWipe on the lovely old iPlayer: http://t.co/dTxMrZyx3B
So #WeeklyWipe starts v shortly on BBC2. CAUTION: contains Katie Hopkins and (separately) an image that may haunt you for 5,000 decades.
Tonight at 10pm: #WeeklyWipe on BBC2. Includes Benefits Street, The Voice, Cunk on crime, Shitverts, Shitpeas, Limmy, Stanhope, Yapp &amp; more.
@Sparkle__Monkey Believe that may be arriving in future episode
Tonight! Weekly Wipe! 10pm! BBC2! Includes Benefits Street! The Voice! Instant snow! Adverts! Cunk, Shitpeas, Limmy, Stanhope, Yapp &amp; more!
*cough* http://t.co/f8ChLkqyXv
@frankieboyle why thank you
Yes, just to be clear, #WeeklyWipe is actually on tomorrow night. Just did the VoiceOver and got carried away, collapsing time and that.
Guess who thought it was Thursday already.
The studio we shoot our Weekly Wipe desk links in is so cold we just had to be rescued by an icebreaker.
@outonbluesix A ref to the stinky button-pushing title. Nothing implying watching it is 'cleverer' than not watching. Of course it isn't.
@outonbluesix Pretty certain I didn't say that, unless I've suffered some kind of blackout.
Wrote something about Benefits Street, because that's the law: http://t.co/HuJUQRhLik
Last night's Weekly Wipe is on iPlayer: http://t.co/lHv89Jl9gp
#WeeklyWipe at 10pm on BBC2 tonight - includes floods, immigrant floods, Kim Jong Un, Stanhope, Cunk, Shitpeas, Limmy and a giant Mel B.
Tonight! Weekly Wipe! BBC2! 10pm! Includes immigration, floods, Danny Dyer on EastEnders, Celeb BB, Stanhope, Cunk, Shitpeas, Limmy &amp; more.
Some folk complaining cos I RT'd a positive front page of The Sun. Pls pen full list of rules for future, then lock it in a box and burn it.
@brain_opera Daredevil
Generic tweet promoting the new series of Weekly Wipe, which starts Thursday 9th January, BBC2, 10pm. Contains footage and sounds.
Of course, you have the option not to watch it, too. Free will, etc.
Listen and look at this: http://t.co/7pNq4KckBf
@laurenlaverne Am extra annoyed when people use their phones to film disasters they're witnessing in the wrong aspect ratio. So, so selfish.
@SarahMillican75 thank you kindly
2013 Wipe is repeated on BBC2 at 10pm on Sun 5th Jan (ie tomorrow). Then new series of Weekly Wipe starts Thurs 9th Jan, BBC2 at 10pm.
@sambaintv @AlCampbeII @danielmaier @gralefrit @JasonHazeley @thewendybain why thank you thank you
Anti-social night owls! How Videogames Changed the World is being repeated again tonight on C4 at the prime time of 23.45.
Here's a thing I wrote for The Grauniad about the year that dies today: http://t.co/vdePoUHnp1
Shove this up your Sunday: 2013 Wipe on iPlayer - http://t.co/Kyssyzc69T
Here, just for you, is 2013 Wipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/Kyssyzc69T
@scousepie it warrants a mention
There will be a brief pause before tonight's #2013Wipe (10.40pm, BBC2) for you to find a bucket to throw up in, or just cling to for company
@ronniejoice Limmy's on in the New Year - 9th Jan onwards
#2013Wipe night is TONIGHT; 10.40pm BBC2. Includes Doug Stanhope, Barry Shitpeas, Philomena Cunk and Nelson Mandela.
@pdstevo I know. Dereliction of duty on my part.
@lainiweiz I say 'bough'. Pretty sure I typed 'enough' but the phone begs to differ.
@lainiweiz Bits of it are, but there's bough archive that isn't that it doesn't officially qualify overall
What's that? You want to be reminded that #2013Wipe is on BBC2 tonight at 10.40pm? That's a weird thing to ask. What's wrong with you?
@GaryTomWilliams nope
#2013WIPE - our now-traditional Wipe review of the year - is on tomorrow, Sat 28th Dec, 10.40pm, BBC2. Contains Broadchurch and nudity.
@Avi_Avikesh yep, tomorrow night on BBC2
It's Friday but not really. No point having named days of the week during the Xmas-New Year perineum.
@mattbernard I think you'll find that's the morning shift.
@VirtuaEnnis Nope, you'll be fine
@Kendohmassif it sure does
THAT'S ENOUGH CHRISTMAS so set your recording devices for #2013WIPE - this Saturday 28th December, BBC2, 10.40pm.
One sleep to go till we're all one Christmas nearer the grave, gang!!!!!!!!!!!
A Christmas message just for YOU: http://t.co/ZkHzMXFdJ5
@giagia twixt new Wipe and new baby - it'll be tight - but soon
@LFBarfe just put In Dulce Jubilo on the 2013 Wipe soundtrack and thus feeling especially festive
You're all a bunch of Christmas cunts.
@jounwin So not explaining that one to you
Advance Christmas warning: 2013 Wipe is on BBC2, Saturday 28th December, 10.40pm. Contains Nelson Mandela and dogging.
Half the lyrics to 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' sound sort of sarcastic tbh
@hattiehattie @EllieCrisell You poor sod. Gargle with hot salt water. Constantly.
@tonyhusband1 ... measurements; thought they were in mm rather than cm. Panicked thinking all cartoons had to be 10x smaller than expected.
@tonyhusband1 Wow, thanks, very kind of you. I remember the first time I was commissioned to draw something for Oink I misread the... [1/2]
@tonyhusband1 Ha, hello. Yes I was. Keep meaning to try my hand at doing some cartoons again but haven't quite found the right inspiration.
BTW, to clear up confusion, the titles were listed chronologically, not in order of merit. We cheated the chronology on the last one so ha.
@Thom_Langley Tricky one but Doom's hard to beat.
That's reminded me, there was a brief glimpse of Dark Souls in it too that had to go walkabouts due to time.
@serafinowicz I've had a few quick goes at it, then thought "this looks like a time sponge" and have been too SCARED to return thus far.
Night owls without YouTube can catch / record a repeat on 4Seven tonight at 2.05am and also the more humane time of 9pm this Saturday.
@KTH_1989 Again, we didn't have time. Would have liked to keep Portal in.
@rob_aux Working on 2013 Wipe now.
@Zoomeister Felt it was too close to Hovver Bovver yeah
Things we sadly had to cut from the games show for time: Walking Dead, a discussion of 'God Games', a bit on Hitchhiker's Guide &amp; Gone Home.
Thanks for nice comments on games doc. But you ought to direct them at @tuckface74 who produced it, along w/ great and knowledgable team.
How Videogames Changed the World is now available on C4's YouTube 4oD channel: http://t.co/jXElZMywuw
BTW, theme music was Jonathan Dunn's theme for the Gameboy version of Robocop: http://t.co/mJxgebV0TL
@jpshaddock Yeah we tried to clear that in time, but couldn't, sadly.
@jonsnowC4 Ha! Delighted you enjoyed it. We'll make you a gamer yet.
Now you really should watch Indie Game the Movie because it's very very good.
THANK YOU co-writers @Jam_sponge @Carachan1 and @disappointment (&amp; a special apology to you Log for credits-mispelling SNAFU) #C4videogames
Yes, it is.
@MarcelAspden Ever heard of chronology?
Hope everyone enjoyed my brilliant Scottish accent there. #C4videogames
Righto, our games show is starting on C4 now. So fuck all that Factor stuff off. #C4videogames
You won't guess what no.1 on the list is. How Videogames Changed the World, 9pm, tonight C4. #C4videogames is hashtag if you care, or don't.
Reckon they did a good job with this: http://t.co/OWqmWlGSea
@jonsnowC4 Hope you get a chance to watch the games show tonight - you might find it interesting. No, really.
@jonsnowC4 @NewStatesman Reckon you should settle this spat with a few rounds of Tekken.
@firebird2110 I wonder if you're taking the world a tad too seriously.
@TheDazeel Yeah, watch the whole thing and you unlock Indie Game: The Movie to watch afterwards.
@Jimmy_S_Oldham He was behind the camera briefly
@gspro15198 Well I guess so but WATCH IT ON THE TELLY as the RESOLUTION will be HIGHER
So yes: tonight! 9pm! Channel 4! How Videogames Changed the World. Also featuring @wossy @daraobriain @SusanCalman @serafinowicz and more...
And here he is more recently, meeting 50 Cent: http://t.co/fYbx1HqFvc
Bit of nostalgia for you in advance of How Videogames Changed the World (Tonight, C4, 9pm): http://t.co/eMOVhLmqUG #C4videogames
@Herring1967 Sitting inside and being taken to his chosen destination. Effectively being chauffeured around, like an earl or a lord or both.
@theinvisiblegor not entirely
@theinvisiblegor can't be certain, no
@tyboris47 It's disgraceful.
@tkingdoll @dcturner No. He saunters everywhere.
@RichAintArsed Watch it in chunks between levels
@KaptainEgo nearly
@cerebralsalad that's the one
@dcturner Brian Ferry is an assassin. He has a silenced pistol. Carries out black ops while humming More Than This.
@jalmelb Spiritually yeah
@dcturner oh fuck. Have I got it terribly wrong? FUCK.
@ballaterbboy No. Not much point tuning in to be honest.
@xiotex oh for the opportunity. Practically slamming the door shut on my hand he was. Not even lying.
He also doesn't know a thing about videogames, which I'm trying to promote in advance of a television programme #scum
@brendandocherty yeah go on
He virtually slammed the door in my face. Some story about going home to relieve the babysitter. Bloke lives in a fucking BUBBLE these days.
@nickwanderson can't rule anything out right now
@Herring1967 I hope you're going to have a quiet word with Stu about his DISGUSTING use of Addison Lee cabs
For the record, he did not look "depressed and / or fat". He looked like a movie star playing Stewart Lee. Reckon he's had surgery too.
@NTillustrators I know - all the more sickening
@gmccann78 dunno. Probly.
To be clear, I love Stewart Lee and everything he does. But if he doesn't clear up this whole Addison Lee thing, he's fucking dead to me.
‚Äú@leftistrhetoric: @charltonbrooker Stewart Lee's comedy vehicle...‚Äù PRODUCT PLACEMENT
‚Äú@ChrispLOL Stewart Lee, Addison Lee #norelation?‚Äù Good point. Can we be certain there's no familial link? No. We cannot.
Cannot believe I saw underground comedy ombudsman Stewart Lee catching an Addison Lee cab earlier this evening. With THEIR policies. Awful.
Just did a classic trip-while-tweeting-and-walking. Probably broke, like, seven toes.
@bob_farrell Think you'll find that's a transcription error. Maybe I didn't shout the letter 'M' loud enough.
@mozzy31 More than a mention
@RyMacleod Apart from that
YES WHY AREN'T THERE? WHY? http://t.co/MEbU4lPTw6
Here's me talking to @keefstuart of Das Guardian about the cavernous gulf between games and TV: http://t.co/gNM7OwaThy
@Rheinmetal85 You telling me this?
@TestEditPlay it's post-watershed - bit of language, some violence - up to them
Here @jonsnowC4 - I DEFY you to tell me THIS isn't better than 'real Lego': http://t.co/rD06rnwdXn
What I'm saying is this: I may not make much sense.
I also fell for the old 'being interviewed while playing a game' scenario, which is like conducting a phonecall while spinning plates.
@uk_russ well I did reprimand them for not pre-installing
@garywhitta You're all present and correct
Just recorded a bit for @Channel4News talking about games with @jonsnowC4 but disgraced self by not knowing how to eject a disc on the PS4.
@fleetstreetfox To be fair, that's pretty much also all of the world.
@daraobriain @Michael_42 See how far that gets you next time you're FLYING A PLANE.
@daraobriain @Michael_42 YOU ARE WRONG. Inverted = CORRECT. Right thumbstick = your head on a pivot. Push FORWARD to look DOWN.
Sneak preview snippet of How Videogames Changed the World: http://t.co/Yd9fKBtfMw
@AlfieMcWawa we tried to clear King of Kong too but there's some distribution issue
Just walked into a communal bog where someone had taken a shit so toxic I felt like the first man on the scene after the Fukushima meltdown.
How Videogames Changed the World, this Saturday, 9pm on C4 will be followed by grrrreat documentary Indie Game: The Movie.
@dcturner @RufusHound See again, I reckon that would be agonising, but not permanently debilitating.
@iamelliot yes that should be on there
@RufusHound But in case of insertion, most of those would easily slide back out- except BT Tower, which would lock in like a grappling hook.
That new 'walkie talkie' skyscraper in London's just gone in at no.7 on my list of landmarks you wouldn't want to unexpectedly sit on.
@yuuki_123 almost certainly
@BlueDeltaMarky Whole chunk on Elite
@cmoorin Yeah that's a bit of a pig but that's life for you
2 HOURS of gameshit on your TV this Sat, covering everything from Pong to The Last of Us. You won't guess what the last game on the list is.
Just finished voiceover for the games doc this Saturday. Managed to sneak the word 'shitifying' in. Which is pretty shitifying itself.
Got a date for the games show. I'll be explaining 'How Videogames Changed the World' on C4, Sat 30th Nov from 9pm.
@Aoifs2707 Xmas ish
Next Grand Theft Auto better have the mayor of Toronto as a playable character.
@DaftLimmy Get this book - think you'll find it fascinating: http://t.co/HxkLYNJUoy
@_TheGeoff Righto. I'll give them a spin.
@lrolles1981 Two hours of escalating fury seemed to pay off in the end.
@BTCare I did eventually get through to someone who was helpful, although they're not able to do anything until Monday apparently...
@BTCare I spent 2 hours on the phone to you lot earlier. Fill out a form? Sure you're not just trying to fool me into wasting yet more time?
@BTCare You poor, poor things.
British Telecom. British fucking Telecom.
@PaulieHughes Actually I believe we have...
@dcmonk79 We cover Elite too; hope you like it.
@IJSbignose yeah but they can fuck off for the night.
@Fubsy 57 minutes just on that alone.
So I'm fronting a one-off 2-hour doc called How Videogames Changed the World on C4 in late Nov. Everything from Pong to Papers, Please...
@Stretchcast They are made of electricity and thumbs
@ChrisZahra it's still installing...
Pretty sure I can forgive GTAV this lengthy install. The anticipation reminds me of the days of http://t.co/080DsF2egV
@jojo1250 Prob later
@jodril yes
Here's an hour-long video of the interview I did with Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan a few weeks back: http://t.co/JKt51pj3al
... and the cast includes the excellent @andynyman as Winston Churchill, which I HAVE to see.
Haven't seen it yet, but Peaky Blinders (BBC2, 9pm) has had strong write ups, comes from Otto Bathurst who directed ep1 of Black Mirror...
Here, apropos of nothing, have a great comedy sketch: http://t.co/c2oM5gB9Da
@jounwin Copy and paste one of these: ######
@casioroee Once had to take someone to A&amp;E because they'd eaten rice that'd been kept warm in a canteen for hours. Puking blood, they were.
@allmyfriends91 He has the audacity to look like me
@CockneyCharmer Not sure yet. It's all shot and cut and polished and everything.
@casioroee It depends on how it was cooked in the first place. Seriously, Google it: rice can be genuinely nasty.
They're handily repeating the first series of A Touch of Cloth tonight on Sky One at 9pm. Also, your hair looks good. Well done.
This new Aussie Prime Minister looks like Sam Neill wearing Tony Blair prosthetics in a movie.
Other programmes are available.
@Alexpletives @shittydeath I'll look the other way
You can see the whole of A Touch of Cloth 2 tonight at 9pm on Sky 1 - with a sneak peek at Karen Gillan in the next Cloth 'case' at the end.
Missed Touch of Cloth 2 finale? It's on catch-up OR see the WHOLE series in one 'feature length' chunk + bonus scenes tomorrow at 9pm, Sky 1
The #TouchOfCloth 2 finale is on Sky1 TONIGHT at 9pm -- ie mere moments away. SPOILER: it ends with scrolling credits accompanied by music.
@kiwifem some kind of telescope?
Finale of #TouchofCloth 2 is TONIGHT, Sky One, at 9pm. Caution: contains nudity. Also some death. Episode 1 is on catch-up if you missed it.
The Touch of Cloth 2 finale is on Sky1 tomorrow night at 9pm; if you missed the first episode, it's being repeated tonight at 9.15pm.
@monstroso The first series is on DVD -- other than that, not legitimately I fear.
@cookdandbombd They could patrol these streets: http://t.co/BjPUKbR8W4
North Americans: I understand all six episodes of Black Mirror will be appearing on one of your channels, starting around November.
@cookdandbombd That photo isn't showing up for some reason, which is adding a level of dramatic tension I wasn't prepared for...
@ashleym2k WPC Cutout is alive and well and was working behind the scenes on ATOC 2 and the forthcoming ATOC3
@BryanDavison1 I'm sure you could find it if you think creatively.
@missy__m Don't think you can, but I'm sure if you snoop around the internet it'll show up.
@Mr_Pauly_C It's got you surrounded.
@SiobhanONeill Yes, but this is the future. It's hard to miss anything completely. It lives on On Demand.
@guzung Aiming to please
@Ms_Anthropy OKAY THEN
@arsington Just watch it on the On Demand thingy.
There's, like, no escaping this Touch of Cloth thing. It's also on the On Demand catch-up thing AND online here: http://t.co/MxCKVi1FDf
@RhiannanKay You could try here: http://t.co/ciSOSAV8Lm
@JohnKeeno Not that I'm aware of
@Bambi_S_Goodman Well someone had to.
@JamieVersey Piracy I can live with, but lazy piracy?
If you missed the 1st part of A Touch of Cloth 2 on Sunday then OH FUCK but luckily for you it's showing again on Sky 2 TONIGHT at 9pm.
Final reminder that #ATouchOfCloth2 ("Undercover Cloth") starts TONIGHT at 9pm on Sky One. Mere MOMENTS from now. That's how time works.
@NavYou111 lots of Carty
Crime spoof A Touch of Cloth II: Undercover Cloth starts tonight at 9pm on Sky One. Contains Stannis from Game of Thrones and several guns.
This is to remind you that the unjustifiably puerile A TOUCH OF CLOTH 2: UNDERCOVER CLOTH starts tomorrow - Sunday 25th Aug at 9pm on Sky 1.
@reidy89 It's there alright, just tricky to find. Try doing a search.
While I'm advertising things, why not try bread? Available from several shops. Cook it. Toss it at wildfowl. Bread. For when you need bread.
@niall_bell what exactly is "football"?
@niall_bell starts Sunday. Starts now if you hit play on the on demand thing though.
@c33jayg nope that's meant to be there
You can now get an early watch of the entire first ep of Touch of Cloth 2 on Sky's On Demand thing. Also, series 1 repeated on Sky 2 at 10pm
Groundhog Day's a pretty good videogame, really.
@i_am_softlad Pretty sure it's on YouTube too, illicitly.
@scoops1200 Yes. That's the point.
In preparation for Touch of Cloth series 2 (which starts Sun Aug 25th), the first Touch of Cloth has popped back up on Sky's On Demand thing
@jkottke Thank you. Short answer is yes. Longer answer is I'm not sure quite when. But I think soonish.
@randomphrase Well there's this: http://t.co/5ZPA4ER8Dy
@LFBarfe Snap
@iball1884 yeah I'm a doofus
A Touch of Cloth 2: Undercover Cloth starts on Sky One, Sunday 25th August at 9pm: http://t.co/XG4yAUAccm
Dreamt there was a Hanna-Barbera series based on Alan Moore's 'From Hell'. Turns out there wasn't.
@EddieArgos isn't there also a "Mr. No"?
@UncleStevenTK on the back of every book?
@Jonnywol_ Bump clearly the best of all
I reckon the Mr. Men start to go downhill from Mr. Clumsy (no. 28) onwards. Mr. Christmas (no. 49) is just taking the piss.
Hey @ukhomeoffice why not make your tweet-a-long-a-stormtroop gallery of brown folk thrown in vans even more dystopian by using cattleprods?
@P_Hayes That aside, do like his point about narcissism and impulse control being the key issue in trolling debate, rather than tech per se.
@P_Hayes I didn't say web is full of morons but then I wasn't writing about "trolls", more feeling overwhelmed by sheer volume...
@LFBarfe Yes, that's the impression I get.
Come to think of it, Private Eye is the *only* paper-and-ink publication I regularly buy and read. Sometimes Edge too, but mainly the Eye.
@holysmoke Yeah, but what did you think of the bit where I reminisced about the arcade version of Outrun?
@Word_Hord I understand it's on its way
Thought I'd already tweeted this but I HADN'T. The Framley Examiner has made a surprise return: http://t.co/OmJpbgrREd
There aren't enough videogames where you just get to silently and methodically kick a lifesize avatar of yourself to death.
@JackofKent What about Roger Hargreaves with his "Mr. Chatterbox"?
@LunaWebster I'm interviewing Vince Gilligan, creator of Breaking Bad, at the TV festival. So he'll be doing the talking. I'll be nodding.
@holysmoke FWIW, I've written a thing about why I'm halting *weekly* schedule for this Monday's Guardian. Short version: am busy and tired.
@DadNeedsDecaf Huh? No, no offence. I replied and then somehow deleted my reply, so replied again. A dog could work a computer better than I
@holysmoke BTW I enjoyed your book Counter-Knowledge. I'm pointing this out in case you think I sound annoyed.
@holysmoke Really? Well I'm denying it now. I never asked Alan Rusbridger to turn comments off and therefore was not turned down. Clear?
@DadNeedsDecaf Sorry, SNAFU. Said "Not entirely, but bit where I demand AR turn comments off, and he refuses, so I quit -- that was wrong."
@AlCampbeII Yeah but fucking hell they're planning to slow them down so they're 45 minutes long and play out in silence I mean what the fuck
@DadNeedsDecaf Not entirely, but the bit where I demand Alan Rusbridger turn comments off, and he refuses, so I quit -- that was wrong.
@EosChater Just got too busy and too jaded and too old to continue at that sort of clip.
@big_tino Not a bad point tbf
@kwoshea Fortunately, I'm cutting back.
@gamesbloke Yeah but those were probably Chris's.
@gamesbloke Turns out I'm bad with words.
@DJDanAdams I guess no-one's listening.
Haven't quit the Guardian: just going to be writing pieces less frequently. Weekly became untenable. Too many columns in the world anyway.
@holysmoke Sadly, the Private Eye story is incorrect. I've got a column in the Guardian this coming Monday, comments and all.
@DaftLimmy Ideally want one where you're sitting in a kitchen off Grand Designs, loose white shirt on, laughing casually while eating pasta.
@DaftLimmy You look happy enough to be on a 'lifestyle' advertising hoarding for a new upscale block of flats.
@benjymous There's no end to it.
@BrianNolan1974 I anonymously quote myself throughout
@ZeroEmerald Wishful thinking I reckon
Writing a thing for the paper about how I'm still writing things for the paper. It's a bit like an out-of-body experience.
Private Eye's got it a bit off: haven't left The Guardian, just stopping weekly column and returning soonish in some non-weekly form.
This royal baby coverage has less connection to everyday reality than Game of Thrones.
@ingsocbloc I applaud your effort though. Far better costumes than I'd have rustled up.
There's a lot of straining and exertion before a baby arrives, as anyone watching the heroic amount of filler on Sky News can tell you.
@claresturges They did bomb them - just didn't manage to kill anyone. Any series of bombings in mainland GB would normally be top story.
@Jamijo71 Yeah. Like how the coverage of the attempted "underpants bombing" was tucked away on the front pages for about a week.
Lot of Proxima Nova around these days.
@PeterRobinson76 is that figure true? Bloody hell etc if so
@BadScentsHumour dread to think what the end of level boss at the end of this weather will look like, aye
Weird how the recent spate of attempted bombings of mosques hasn't been higher up the news agenda, what with it being, y'know, terrorism.
@camillalong Great. Best bits are the stuttery-zooms-in-time-to-the-music. Only thing that cd improve it is if N Witchell showed up at end.
"Dear Malala, sorry we shot you. Yours sincerely, The Taliban. P.S. For being literate enough to read this you are condemned to death."
If the Taliban had shot *me* I'd want a letter from them like a hole in the head.
@SmoleMon If you looked inside all the houses, you could've found where she wakes up every morning.
HEY FUCKFACE here's an interview @Carachan1 did with me about videogames: http://t.co/9T9opUpYDp http://t.co/2jeT97K9Ge
@frankieboyle That's an alternate reading I hadn't considered.
@ReeceShearsmith The Wottingers seem to have been cruelly airbrushed from history, mind.
@ReeceShearsmith Iggle Piggle is about 6ft 4in. It had the Pontipines and everything.
Pretty sure In The Night Garden Live is the only time I've actually shed a tear in a theatre.
@lsd1974 I couldn't possibly comment.
@Mickeleh I believe it's about to happen.
Next time we need a new Black Mirror promo poster image, I'm suggesting this: http://t.co/Mme1SnQb2z
@DaftLimmy I know, but they move funny.
@DaftLimmy God knows but in my case spider terror is as automatic / instinctive as pulling hand away from fire. No thought process involved.

@jounwin From the depths of the uncanny valley, that thing.
If they shouted a successive word of a classic novel instead of grunting at each serve, Wimbledon would be more educational.
@quantick I imagine looking at that photo on LSD would be a confusing experience for you
Come to think of it, "Vanish Tip Exchange" sounds like a badly-translated porn film.
Music from the Vanish Tip Exchange advert's stuck in my head like a fucking harpoon.
@cYnborg Thought we were all on that list by default
@G_Mantell whistling the theme to Blake's 7

@satsuma_hat August
On a train. Driver just made a mundane announcement. He sounds like a US action hero.
@jamiepbarker Edge doesn't have writers, you silly billy. It's generated by an algorithm. Nincompoop. Wally.
@riazat_butt It's all short films and repeats then
You'd think given the fasting diet fad there'd be scope for wider Ramadan coverage on TV than a lousy 3am slot on Channel 4.
At this rate Snowden's going to have to apply for asylum in Narnia.

@grahamcoxon There should be a setting that makes it clear you're sitting facing away from the screen with arms folded.
@leighalexander IT IS DESPICABLE AND THE WORST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED
@jmouldingBRAND yeah, ¬£10k a tweet. Revolting.
@craig_owens Their cherry-picked data is no match for my vague suspicion.
@rotational Still can't forgive Edge for the photomontage of John Lennon fellating a PS2 I imagine it possibly printed.
@craig_owens Yeah, but I'm right and they're wrong.
@MarshDavies Very nice covers they are too
@roosgoff you can play games on them
I will, of course, buy both consoles at the earliest opportunity, because I'm absolutely tragic.
@RaidingKvatch Actually, they do.
The PS4's nauseating "social" features look set to transform gaming into a ninny's Facebook account with a joystick glued to the front.
@Carachan1 It knows best
@Brad676Parker I always buy every console. Well, except the Wii U.
@Zeouterlimits Halo is fucking boring, which is probably why they like it.
Let's not forget what a capricious, user-unfriendly snobelisk the PS3 can be. And that PSN hack, etc.
Something very annoying about Edge's unrelenting long-term Sony fetish. Tempted to buy an Xbox One out of bloody-mindedness now.
@DaftLimmy It'll show up on MAME in 8 years though
@blairbuchanan Loved the ending
@stu_mather_ I liked Far Cry 3, but this stomps all over that.
@DaftLimmy It IS basically Manhunt reworked as The Road, but very very very well done.
Okay, just finished The Last of Us. Exceptional.
Example seemed alright offstage. I'm away now to play a computer game, like the bewildered old man I am.
I reckon this is an Apprentice task.
@Dancad No, in fact they asked if we minded, which was polite since they didn't have to.
Glastonbury. 'Example' on BBC3 now is exactly  like watching a farmer's boy howl along to the character select music on a shit beat-em-up.
Turns out iPads are great for training little kids to automatically slap any television they see with an open palm.
Noticed several cockups with Amazon Autorip - old albums it thinks I've bought which it's confused w/others w/similar titles. Anyone else?
Can we have Amazon Autorip for books too please? Ta.
I just can't get enough of the Vanish Tip Exchange. Sincerely hope these ads run forever.
@algernonradish No, but they graciously checked we didn't mind, which we didn't. BB team were very very good to us throughout Dead Set.
@ratbanjos no. Cow plus cow equals bison
@serafinowicz reckon an exclamation mark at the end would take the edge off that
Reasoning with anyone who earnestly believes in psychics is like trying to communicate with the dead.
If I was the Daily Mail I'd insist on paying psychic Sally Morgan's damages using magic 'ghost coins' which she can spend in the afterlife.
Ppl claiming the PS4 will do updates "in background". It'll still find a way to make you do its admin somehow. It has contempt for humans.
@thomaswebb1985 10/10
At least the PS4 will let you play MP3s during the mandatory 50 minute system updates you'll be sitting through twice a week. Maybe.
Xbox One: now 8% less nakedly evil!
U turn? Microsoft trying to lull 'gamers' into a false sense of security. Xbox One will whisper commands into your ear while you sleep.

@lucyprebblish I actively dislike most seasons of Mad Men until about 1/2 way through when I suddenly decide I love it.
@davidschneider No, surely the GoT lyrics are: "Tolkein, it's like Tolkein, with some tits in, tits in Tolkein, tits in Tolkein..." Etc
@lucyprebblish Really? Are you up to date? I love this season.
The lyrics to the Mad Men theme tune are: "Mad Men, Mad Men, Mad Men, Mad Men, Mad Men, Mad Men, Mad Men, Mad Mad Me-nnn".
@eugenespeed2 tbh I think the licence fee should be raised, but should only apply for over-25s and / or people on a reasonable salary.
@dafscrawf Yes, that's on the page, but that was the only link I could find.
@eugenespeed2 Then you must be crazy! Having a TV licence so you can watch the iPlayer, but not owning a TV? Mad! Nuts!
@eugenespeed2 Do you use the iPlayer?
Anyone who doesn't set their TV recording devices to snaffle this TONIGHT is a maniac: http://t.co/cTUoL3aPuP
@matthewbloch Last of Us by several miles I'd say. Bioshock Inf = great visuals, interesting theme but only above average gameplay IMHO
@JoshV_Bean Well to be fair there as a pretty big gap between 2 and 3
@wossy They could at least have arranged the ones left more artfully to disguise the size of the gaps
@JoshV_Bean Love all the Fallouts
@ComedicPerson Oh yes, played Jak and Daxter way back over there in the past.
@Bugle_Duck Yes and no. In terms of bleakness? Yes. Gameplay more like original Resident Evil meets Manhunt via Uncharted.
@ComedicPerson Uncharted 3, which I enjoyed
@SamTerroni I'll look the other way. Hey, we'll probably need footage of the ENTIRE GAME for 2013 Wipe so you'd be entirely justified.
What I'm saying is it's a very good game.
@SathyaJames It's not them
@Linko64 yep
@TheAngrySmurf I dunno. The phone coverage looks terrible in post-cataclysm America.
Not a spoiler, but there's one monster that MANGLES your face when it catches you. Rips it apart like a junkie tearing open a handbag. #TLOU
Yeah, I mean TLOU, not TLOS. Don't know what TLOS is. The Lounge of Spiders? That's what TLOU is like. A lounge full of spiders.
@naomiwongo yep, just done that bit. Deeply unpleasant.
TLOS is so horribly tense. I had to pause and pop on here for a bit, leaving 'Joel' hiding from some really angry guys armed with pipes.
@Bugle_Duck That's one for Viz Top Tips
@Victoriah_ Brightwell-cum-Sotwell I think you'll find
The Last of Us is mainly proving that in an apocalyptic survival scenario, I'd spend 90% of my time cowering behind a desk. No change there.
@laurenlaverne @prodnose @VictoriaCoren I prefer to imagine the seasons are on "shuffle mode"
@DJ_Grot_Box At the end it pulls out to reveal it was all being dreamt by a cartoon donkey

@danielmaier These fuckers: http://t.co/ZooedlY7tL
@chriscoope wuh? How do I check that?
@brain_opera I once played Tetris for so long I dreamt it was really happening
@NoreenKehoe Yep, gruelling fun but kept crashing
@brain_opera Ah, but that pre-dates Doom, no?
@CamFantastic1 what, sing "Morning Has Broken"?
@jimbillinski nah, too big. Pinkies just got you with their teeth.
@SK123_Tunes uh oh. Don't like the sound of that. No, why?
@Acoustic_Aaron Lob a brick to distract, sneak up and shiv. Preferably after 25m of hesitation.
@CamFantastic1 Absolutely
@theCraigLaw NO
They just run up and kill you. Bam. One chomp and you're gone. That's a proper monster, that is. Bloody hate them.
I hereby declare 'the Clickers' from Last of Us to be the scariest videogame monster I've encountered since the 'Pinkies' from Doom.
@josephholden2 Unfollow, FFS
@ianmodmoore @imranyusuf Not just any old game, a game where you spend hours clutching makeshift weapons, sweating with terror. Fun, like.
Lots of stealth in Last of Us. Just spent 30m hiding behind a desk while a man with Zapruder footage for a head walked round and round.
@cabe_bedlam pretty desolate opening I'd say
@laurenlaverne ah but I hadn't played it then. It IS very good though. Very very bleak, mind.
Another Last of Us observation: I hope I don't spend this much time crouch-walking if the apocalypse REALLY comes. Knees couldn't take it.
@DaftLimmy Harrowing United Colors of Benetton poster
That Sun "Jacko's Ghost" front page is a fuck sight more interesting than the honours list.
@nowtgoodtosay working title
@Carachan1 I find Plants vs Zombies too stressful. Like air traffic control probably is, I reckon.
@RyMacleod The Best of Us; The Worst of Us; The Lastening of Us; Last II Die; TLOS: Requiem; The Last Off Us; Lasty Wasty Bum Circus. Etc
Enjoying Last Of Us, but if it had a playable 30sec ad break where I made a cartoon cow do pirouettes every hour or so, I wouldn't complain.
@somebadideas I thought Bioshock Inf was like reading an interesting magic realist novel in the middle of a firing range.
@simoncook1 Bought it. Seems worth it thus far.
@Rammsoldat It opens on a similarly uplifting note.
So far The Last Of Us seems pretty good, if a tad depressing. It's a bit like working in an oblivion factory. I don't know what that means.
Will be on @10oClockLive on C4 at the NOVELTY TIME of 10.30pm tonight. Subject: PRISM. PRISM.

I'll be on @10oClockLive on Channel 4 in a bit (ie 10pm) to 'do' the news that Star Wars is returning to the UK. And some other stuff.
@danielmaier Oh yuss
Amongst other things, this week I'm looking at The Apprentice on @10oClockLive tonight...
Will be on @10oClockLive on Channel 4 very shortly, just because.
So I'll be on @10oClockLive later -- if you want specifics, Channel 4 at 10pm -- to have a point-and-LOL at UKIP and Miliband and that.

Thoroughly enjoyed Thomas Was Alone -- oddball minimalist platformer. I like to think of it as 'Tetris the Movie'. Good work @mikeBithell
Can't believe he dropped that souffle after all that loud hectoring.
Because that would be horrible.
Have they ever done a Masterchef special where they have to cook a dish made entirely of ingredients cut or expelled from their own bodies?
Is there a special prize on Masterchef for the contestant who pulls the most exaggerated facial expressions?
Back on Channel 4 in about 20 mins for @10oClockLive.
So @10oClockLive returns tonight at 10 o'Clock on C4. It's okay, I've had a haircut and everything. My specialist subject this week: Boston.
@Kristabel77 Wordy?

@RobOubridge Delighted to see you survived the Apache death farm...
@BomTutterworth I know, terrible.
@dicanio_99 not an option sadly
@RyMacleod Will try best to cope.
Tricky writing a column on Friday for Monday and having to do anything other than Boston (no idea how it'll play out, see). That's life.
CNN could relaunch as rolling '+1' channel where they explain what they reckon might happen precisely one hour from now.
Actually the Boston 'arrest' cockup is probably a good move for CNN. Turns it into a sort of 'mystery channel' where you guess what's true.
CNN just confirmed Thatcher's made a full recovery.
CNN is essentially just footage of reporters in the street staring in bewilderment at their iPhones right now.
@quantick @laurenlaverne How do you write boxer shorts?
Who'd have thought the Spitting Image reunion would be so expensive?
Hey, if the Thatcher state funeral goes well maybe we can have one every year.
Call me a doom-monger, but I reckon this ten-minute nationwide ban on breathing during the Thatcher funeral is going to cause problems.
Does every Thatcher controversy have to have a bell at the heart of it? When will the bells end?

@ExpBelieve Oh sorry. Didn't realise money = intellect.
I apologise for calling everyone on Twitter a narcissist. Surely we're better than that.
Irony = anyone on Twitter criticising Bieber for being a 'narcissist'.
Twitter defends memory of Anne Frank by persecuting teenager.
Bet if you went through the Anne Frank tribute book you'd find far dumber statements left by other 19-year-olds.
Finding it v hard to get outraged over what Justin Bieber said about Anne Frank. Clearly need some serious high horse practice.

@RevStu @benjymous @ShapeyFiend @robertflorence Vaguely think I might've seen it in a cinema once...
@philmoore79 That sounds vaguely like it should be a hit Cheryl Cole single or something.
@AlCampbeII I got them both at the same time in the mid 90s I seem to recall. Second-hand. I had an Amstrad CPC before that, like an idiot.
@AlCampbeII Actually by "too old to appreciate", I mean "years after I initially wanted one". Clumsy words.
@AlCampbeII I only had an Amiga when I was too old to appreciate one, really, and by then I had a 2nd hand ST too. Didn't get the PD discs..
@robertflorence BEING A SPECTRUM BOY I've never heard this before. Ooh it's good, that.

@Dansodic Where did I "hate on it"? I said it was "great fun".
@that_cat_guy Yes, played the first two.
@EdGutteridge90 Yes that was good too.
@TheElatedBoy It's also a game in which you collect magic shirts and shoot people with pop guns.
@jwusher Games make more money than films and TV. They have won. No-one's confined to the spare room. Bioshock *is* pretentious.
I'm surprised it doesn't put wanky quotes onscreen ala Call of Duty each time you die.
To be clear, Bioshock Infinite is great fun. But *very* pretentious. Feels like the second Matrix movie crossed with Alice in Wonderland.
@TheElatedBoy ... says a 12-year-old boy on Xbox Live.
@JonathanHaynes Yes, but it's hard to concentrate on the architecture when you're shooting a man in the neck for the 10,000th time.
They should've called it Shooty Magic Adventure just to fuck Edge magazine off.
Bioshock Infinite's alright, but spare me the surrounding philoso-wank. It's a game where you shoot guns and cast spells like a wizard.
@richardosman No. Well, nothing you can't handle. It also includes one of the most incredible single-shot sequences I've ever seen.
@GraemeJ_83 not sure I've seen it all in one go
@marieluc I know, awful
Only recently discovered Tokyo Jungle. Streets of Rage meets Life on Earth.
@DaftLimmy I've ruined your memories of the film forever. Reached back through time and scribbled "FIRST" all over the picture.
@DaftLimmy I feel sort of bad now.
@tokyo_sexwhale Yes, staggering sequence that.
@marieluc Watch it and find out. That's how films work.
Film likers! I highly recommend The Secret in Their Eyes, which is on BBC4 tonight at 9.50pm. If you like good films, that's a good film.

How TV Ruined Your Life 'Aspiration' episode on iPlayer: http://t.co/pDiz9S9lAJ
@East_ Shhh
So the SPECIAL How TV Ruined Your Life episode aimed at you - *you specifically* (whoever you are) - is on BBC2 in a few mins, at 10pm.
@simonpegg WHAT ABOUT THE KIDDYWINK Zs THAT RUN IN THE ORIGINAL DAWN OF THE DEAD, EH PEGG? I don't want to THRASH this out with you AGAIN.
@AllyFogg No. Unless you take the view that everything is compiled from something, in which case yes. But no, it isn't. I PROMISE.
@mePadraigReidy ha, prob worth less than the p&amp;p
Tonight's episode of How TV Ruined Your Life is definitely the one to see, if you only see one of them. BBC2 tonight at 10pm.
@graham1A Yep I figured that. Just reflecting that doing a compilation show now draws criticism from across the globe.
@graham1A You're angry because you torrented my show and it wasn't what you expected?
@jonronson Well I hope you use your nine-day *holiday* to consider how to atone for that shame.
@jonronson What's a "vacation"?
There's like totally a reshowing of the 'Lifecycle' episode of How TV Ruined Your Life on BBC2 very soon. And by 'very soon' I mean 10pm.
@NicholasRees1 Aha. Yes, well: Leveson outcome so baffling it requires diagrams.
@NicholasRees1 Hey, you're right. Perhaps I should just guffaw at the unrelenting bloodshed. It's miles away.
@Billymanning I'm not 100% sure, but I think that may be the dopiest possible response to that tweet. Congratulations.
Why can't the NRA just be honest and admit they're being bankrolled by America's booming coffin industry?
So confused about press regulation. Don't even know what a 'rubicon' is.

@HelenOxbrough think it is - you have to search then choose on demand
@batemanfan I'd have to taper it first I think.
@cianginty Very happy for you. At this end, it's making me jump through hoops.
@caitlinmoran Glamorous tech seduces population into lifetime of tedious admin. It's basically a Black Mirror episode I haven't done yet.
Essentially, iTunes is now a reboot of this: http://t.co/nystEgoP8e
Pretty sure iTunes now is worse than Windows was in the early 00s.
@pauljbarton Ah, but because the restore has a newer OS than the new phone, it requires me to do a ton of admin first.
@theronster It's an awful shitfest that makes the user do tons of 'paperwork'.
Trying to restore an old iPhone backup onto a new iPhone is a bit like I imagine applying for a visa in some totalitarian state feels like.
@TheJackONeill Went live today.
Looks like 4oD has appeared on Sky (if you hook your box up to the internet). All of Dead Set and Black Mirror should be on there.
@Ruanejoe Actually, I retract the word "dickhead" from that tweet anyhow. Too kneejerk mardy of me. Apologies.
@darralluk07 No-one's been paid to promote this show. They just like Kevin a lot and find him v funny. Sorry.
Few minutes to go till It's Kevin on BBC2. You may have noticed people incessantly recommending it to you.
@RobGigg I blame the typeface.
@RobGigg Look again.
@justmightbeokay Ha, what about it?
Never written a parody account; haven't written for the Guide since 2010. Just so you know.
@MikejpWalsh Wasn't me, I'm afraid. But the "Dave Lee's Travails" joke was funny.
@Julian5News I'm afraid it wasn't me either.
@AlCampbeII Pfff. Hide and seek, that's what that is.
@TenGaugeMary If you're talking about the DLT parody account, I'm afraid that wasn't me. Haven't written for the Guide since 2010.
@profanityswan Nope, haven't written for the Guide since 2010. Also "Dave Lee's Travails" prob a funnier line than I'd have written.
@Ruanejoe I can write what I want, when I want. Everyone's got a platform these days, dickhead.
@stevejjames Yes.
I've written something about games which encourage you to murder total strangers from a remarkable distance: http://t.co/zekJEXmKwe
Comedy fans. Have you *seen* IT'S KEVIN's cast and writing team? HAVE A BLOODY LOOK: http://t.co/qoKa5KClBL BBC2, 10.30pm tonight.
@gracedent That image should come with a warning.
Could've left the last line out if you ask me: http://t.co/EuVwtFM4dL
In China, I should say. He's in the station now.
Bizarre scenes on Sky News right now. Live from the back of police van.
@sophielard but sometimes a bum makes a funny sound and then all brown smelly shit comes out of it and it's funny
@sophielard Wee-wees and poo-plops make me laugh
@futoomph was keeping it edgy
@damongreenITV sounds like a cool theme park tbf
@SharonNayyar It's me.
@tommcdade Fuck. Apologies.
They're repeating How TV Ruined Your Life on BBC2, starting tonight at 10pm. That's a boring fucking tweet but hey, it was free.
@unklerupert @indiegamemovie @PHIL_FISH Yep, wonderful film, wonderful game.
@porksmith I say 'kind'. I mean 'mind'.
@porksmith Bear in kind it's a true story. That'll cheer you right back up.
@WomberlingFree it's not been on yet
Prefer him to last pope tbh
Do some tricks, pope.
Of course being a coward I wouldn't make these jokes about an Islamic pope.
Hmm. This new pope seems kind of religious.
@vembir YOU'RE JOKING? THE POPE? OH MY GOD.
Not sure this new pope is really pulling his weight. #resign
Sky News has a dedicated "ceremonial events commentator". Hope he was chosen in a ceremony.
@larbertred OUTRAGEOUS
@CyberGoth YOU'RE JOKING? THE POPE? OH MY GOD.
Some of you tweeting me that clip. But it misses off the 'you're joking' at the start. Most galling.
@JonathanHaynes annoyingly, can't find one that's just that clip but doesn't miss off the "you're joking" at the top
You're joking? The pope? Oh my  God.
@gracedent Can never get enough Kevin Eldon
Well good Lord if this isn't the best opening sequence I've seen in years: http://t.co/rpqTVr22eq
Here's an unusual event being held in tribute to @Alice_Pyne: http://t.co/YYogwEJtuo
@RyMacleod Holy. Fuck. #mindblown #reeling
@RyMacleod Come off it, that's a brilliant line. Why IS he the hunted? I must find out. See? Hooked already. Great stuff. Great.
@fleetstreetfox I think it's operating in display-only mode.
@JARVIO83 touch√©
Invented some apps: http://t.co/5U3N6gGc2f
@ManMadeMoon I wanted to call it 'Wiped Off the Face of the Week' but apparently that was too long
@richardosman You should Words With Friends her. She'll destroy you. I gave up playing her.
@seanFsmith It just seems funnier when I'm bleeped
@richardosman surely klutz is spelt with a k?
@ahonestmouthful wtf? That can't be real
@Gilscottprendrz Pretty sure that's illegal and you're going to prison forever.
@RoryJ77 Thank you for your feedback
When I say B Shitpeas, I mean @AlCampbeII, who also directed all Wipes bar Weekly Wipe- which he SKIPPED in favour of IT'S KEVIN, the JUDAS.
Not only does IT'S KEVIN star the brilliant Kevin Eldon, it's directed by Barry Shitpeas and sports an incredible writing team.
I would also STRONGLY suggest you watch THIS from Sunday Mar 17th -- IT'S KEVIN, Kevin Eldon's new show: http://t.co/qoKa5KClBL
@daniellaeiou THAT IS BRILLIANT
@DaftLimmy Classic 70s movie poster
Sort of a surprise: as of Thursday BBC2 are repeating How TV Ruined Your Life: http://t.co/74RzJzFwhC
@SamTerroni How old? I have a onesie, but only because The Farm gave everyone one.
@SamTerroni Call the police, I reckon
@VictoriaCoren pretty sure there's a brilliant Farage / poker pun to be had but I don't know quite enough about either category to make it
@ThisIsCyberfire It's almost all done at the last minute
@VictoriaCoren yeah, but do you think Nigel Farage is good at poker?
@tokyo_sexwhale can't say I'm feeling very backlashed. Whoever said that is a cunt.
@JARVIO83 yes apologies, in retrospect that wasn't clear from my tweet
It is *literally* written by a 6-year-old, incidentally. That wasn't a joke.
@LazySavant ah that hadn't occurred to me
@mrsdonga well saved
@JARVIO83 Just looked through your tweets. Her material trounces yours and you must be, what, 9? Give up.
@mrsdonga you have no heart
@thenoikz Do you think so? That literally never occurred to me.
New topical comedy show written by a 6-year-old: http://t.co/TNtk8Gduou (courtesy @robertflorence)
@ianskenny pretty sure it's Twilight Zone as I've seen it, but never seen Outer Limits
@DaftLimmy Wow, he really is a cunt. Face, trousers, shoes. Before you even get to the instruments: a total cunt.
@missdianemorgan it fizzled out
@ianskenny think that's a Twilight Zone, no? Original story ended with him saying "I'll be right over" and hanging up.
@DaftLimmy Someone should jump off with a cymbal glued to their face, see what sort of racket that makes.
@DaftLimmy I read an interview with a tube driver who hit a suicidal passenger once. Said head made sound like sledgehammer hitting steel.
Something haunting about this: http://t.co/D10HCd6YyW
I'm no Nostradamus, but I predict this won't end well: http://t.co/DO5xCNrJZB
@jounwin He absolutely has a point
@NumberOneAndy The ads are a pain, but hey, they paid for it.
Just realised all these complaints about tech are being collected by the robot hivemind and will be used against me when the machines rise.
@SteMcPhee I invented the refrigerator. Bet you didn't know that, fuckface.
Hey Sony, for the PS4 why don't you create a front end made of baffling hieroglyphics and 10,000 nested menus? Come on guys, dare to dream.
Aha, okay, you can turn off the info tap now, thanks everyone. So I need double the space. Thanks Sony. Keep up the good work.
Apols for dull tweet but: trying to d'load TRaider from Sony Store. PS3 has 22Gb free space, game is 12Gb, error msg claims not enough space
@lansimakisp Read the comics already.
@jearle This is what I'm whining about, yes.
I don't think Sarah Lund could fathom her way through Sony's baffling interface. You have to exit the store to change credit cards? Buh.
It's not on there in HD though. Dunno why.
@henriksen1 Of course I'm not getting paid for fuck's sake. I'm buying it from the Sony store, if their poxy machine will let me.
@Vinncent Tunnelbear?
That reminds me, Black Mirror s1 is on Netflix for those of you who can't be arsed with 4oD
All I want to do is download the new Tomb Raider game in honour of International Women's Day. This PS3 is taking a dim view of that.
@scullyx100 Seek help.
The PS3 is really quite hilariously haughty, as machines go. It just told me off for not switching it off properly last time.
@scullyx100 HOW DARE YOU POINT THIS OUT? HOW DARE YOU!!! HOW!!!!! DARE!!!!! YOU?????
@DaftLimmy Fuckin' juicing, press-benching, the lot.
@lancshiker Oh no, don't get me wrong, comps are a piece of piss
@DaftLimmy 39 fifty or so
@ElvisLeeBoy Me too
@laurenlaverne @glinner He should be a continuity announcer
@Glinner Guy in the video shop ruined The Vanishing for me as I rented it
@RealBobMortimer @laurenlaverne Wow. So white they're unreal. Like a Gillliam Python animation.
@DaftLimmy YOU LITTLE EMPEROR
@DaftLimmy Elite Squad
@DaftLimmy Night of the Hunter
@DaftLimmy Headhunters
@AlCampbeII disgraceful laziness for which I squarely blame you
That Bieber footage appears to show a bunch of fat blokes swearing at a teenager till he shouts back at them.
I'd definitely watch a remake of Falling Down starting Justin Bieber, that's for sure.
Just saw Justin Bieber threatening to lamp a pap who called him a cock. Quite like Justin Bieber now.
@eugeneverb arf arf
@SamTerroni You can sift through five hundred hours of snowman sketches
Who'd have thought I'd be moaning about the same thing three years later? It's almost like the whole world doesn't care.
You know what you'll get next time, just for complaining? Four and a half episodes and a chalk sketch of a fucking snowman.
@Herring1967 Well exactly. I mean wielding those editing scissors is hefty business.
@stu_mather_ Fair point
@Herring1967 That's a thought.
Some days we scarcely bothered showing up. It was like 29 minutes work a week.
I like being called 'lazy' after a series of five episodes plus a compilation. Lord knows we all stuck to a lazy schedule on that show.
Turns out I ignored all your app suggestions in the thing I just wrote. That's life.
BTW, here's a sort of podcast-interview thingamjig I did the other day with @KenPlume -- http://t.co/MfWaa0uKCY
@jonronson Did you split them climbing over a wall to escape an angry farmer who caught you 'scrumping'?
@KidNarco THE PENGUINS BIT WAS NEW, YOU INGRATE
@BlackwellMcr Never going to happen.
@GraingerNeil @marcusbrig @zottles It *is* shit though, isn't it?
@AmigaBeanbag Good one.
@TheMeddlingMatt Pretty sure that exists. Website where you tap spacebar in time to tune in your head and it guesses what it is.
@Hara_Hachi_Bu Impossible
@EosChater Well that's just using the filters correctly on Zoopla etc isn't it?
@becthulhu Might be a niche market, that.
@jonronson @danielmaier I'm going to make your face-Shazam app, and I'm going to make a billion pounds with it. You can't stop me.
@RufusHound that's kind of vague
@TheSinghRay Ah now that I'm already working on. Think I have the perfect solution. Will be revealed Monday.
@jonronson @danielmaier I don't think that counts as 'in beta'. More like hovering around omega.
@cassiepoe Now the racism and sexism is arguably fair enough. But spelling? FASCIST.
@jamesromeanes This may prove tough to fix.
@jonronson @danielmaier You'd better be lying Ronson. That app will destroy the fucking world and you know it.
@portraitinflesh Reckon I can solve that.
@Will_J_MS this is good
@on_the_snaff I'll be honest with you, that might be a tricky one.
@danielmaier I thought Jon Ronson was copyrighting Shazam for faces.
Q: What problem do you have that you wish could be solved by an app? I'm going to create some apps. I say "create", I mean "imagine".
@Nordlebash You needn't bother. Other channels are available.
Tonight's Weekly Wipe, BBC2 10pm, is a very special edition (a comp). It has some new stuff in it though, before you burn us at the stake.
@batlad6662814 Plenty. I just don't seem to have a knack for expressing it.
The problem with Twitter is it's just so fucking full of people.
@Andalya Have you heard of "jokes"?
@head_brewer Mario music was deliberate diss. And collegehumor clearly labeled. So you're failing to make any kind of point I'm afraid.
Apparently that was some pretty bad pidgin Spanish from me right there
Black Mirror serie 2 comienza esta noche en TNT en Espa√±a.
@camillalong ta. Caused myself no end of grief by basing whole thing round an anti-comments tract which I had to excise 1st thing this morn
@danielmaier YOU KNOW WHAT HARLEM SHAKE IS NOW THOUGH AND THAT'S THE MAIN THING
@EllieCrisell @danielmaier EVIDENTLY NOT
Everyone tweet @danielmaier now and tell him what Harlem Shake is.
@TheRealCulls pretty sure someone's popped it on youtube
@ConnorsLucy it's from Beethoven's 7th symphony
Buh? http://t.co/V74QnZFHmF
@prodnose Yes, that sounds incredibly likely, when you put it like that.
@prodnose Chances of waking at 5 are zero and you know it. Why not work for 20 minutes, have a sip, then repeat till drunk or finished.
@JomasTheTones can't claim credit for that line - 'twas @gralefrit and Hazeley
@thematthorne we do it deliberately so I'm more cartoonish than rabid
@SlideshowBlog can't be arsed, sorry
@rosshatt PINK
Latest Weekly Wipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/n6INVWxgzK
@prodnose WHY DO THE NORTHERN IRISH HATE OUR HARDWORKING TEAM SO?
When I said "a few" minutes I was kind of underplaying it. I should've just said "ten o' clock" and left, really.
@dancingbear76 No. I'm like all in your face, okay?
@JackYeado I guess that's what it's there for.
@NumberOneAndy Yeah, what of it?
@RobMcKechnie Force a grin out.
@mcfcbeth Have a mug of cocoa.
@dr_dr_jenkins NO
@DJRobOwen You are hereby banned from ever watching any of the Wipe programmes ever again.
@muzzer_daftbat It almost certainly won't come true. Actually, it might do, and we will all perish.
@RyanMarshall_11 You poor, poor sod.
This is your final Weekly Wipe reminder, because it's on BBC2 in a few minutes. Also: how are you? Everything ok? Good. That's good to hear.
@Charliecondou Who?
Seems we inadvertently predicted the Harlem Shake in Black Mirror S1: http://t.co/0T7yxe4zlw (via @SkinnyHornAfriq)
@SkinnyHornAfriq haha
Tonight! #WeeklyWipe! BBC2 10pm! Pistorius! PS4! Brits! Harlem Shake! Mantel! Food Glorious Food! Cloud Atlas! Stanhope! Shitpeas! Cunk! etc
@jonronson Sickening amount of hope on your face there.
@ajhmurray yeah you are. You're so irresponsible I bet you're not even in the driver's seat.
@DanJForrest Well they seem to like it
@eamonnduffin ah but you don't see it AT THE RIGHT TIME. It's mainly annoying when I'm trying to shamelessly promote what time the show's on
@seoulkkachi You're forgiven in that case.
@JohnDubyaUK Don't worry, they'll explain it.
On #WeeklyWipe tonight BBC2 10pm we have @DougStanhope on Twitter and Shitpeas &amp; Cunk ( @AlCampbeII &amp; @MissDianeMorgan) on the Harlem Shake.
@Nixemus FUCKING KISS-ARSE
@Johneke Consider this the sixth.
@PLMoran67 Traitor.
@OfficialRobK That's pretty much correct.
@acidkeith http://t.co/fFM9AObkx8
@DeborahJaneOrr I know. I might as well be recommending the use of the abacus.
... not that you ever do anything as prehistoric as watching television 'live', you button-jabbing gadfly.
Anyway, point is, late NI scheduling means the show won't go up on the iPlayer till late. So you're best off actually watching it on TV...
@Northern_Souled We call it an office. It's basically an inhabited skip.
Why do the Northern Irish hate #WeeklyWipe so much they won't screen it at the SAME TIME as the REAL BBC2? Open weeping in the WW office.
You know what's on BBC2 Northern Ireland IN MY ANOINTED SLOT? A 30-minute interview with James Nesbitt. Pretty Northern Irish, to be fair.
... viewers in Norn Iron should be able to see it AT THE RIGHT TIME, WHICH IS TEN O' CLOCK by accessing the BBC HD channel.
By the way, because #WeeklyWipe is broadcast an hour later in Northern Ireland, it takes ages for them to put it on the iPlayer...
@DeborahFW Oh yeah, loads of people would visit it. Loads. It wouldn't need the weight of a paper behind it.
@strickers66 The emphasis on 'sharing' and 'social' bullshit made me hate the PS4 intensely. Also, almost all the games looked v v v dull.
@DeborahFW Just remember it's all made up and I laughed my fucking head off when coming up with the storyline.
Tonight's #WeeklyWipe (BBC2, 10pm) covers everything from the PS4 to Oscar Pistorius to Food Glorious Food. All other TV shows are bullshit.
@wossy I wish I was running. Been sitting in an edit inhaling biscuits for weeks. Can scarcely walk right now.
@wossy You have to keep going, apparently.
@shamem symmetry
@dbbcfc the cut of its jib
@Liam_Donnelly I am an Xbox fanboy. The Playstation is shit and awful.
@tom_galex V pleased with the new ones; frustrated by the delay in screening them.
@HumanityPlague I know. Can't fucking BELIEVE they're not rebooting that fucker.
@ricpussayshot I think it looks rather cheery
@HumanityPlague nope
@AustinDocking partly
@tom_galex Two more whole stories written and shot; dunno when Sky are screening them
Right this second we're putting the finishing touches to tomorrow's #WeeklyWipe for your entertainment. EYES: http://t.co/ynKRE0bUOU
@SophyRidgeSky He is surely the best Doctor Who we never had.
@robertflorence Just saw a Random Acts and thought "this is very good", then saw your lot'd done it. Well done on doing that thing.
Last #BlackMirror is on C4 at 10. Not a scary one this time, unless you're terrified by blue cartoon bears, in which case it's terrifying.
Tonight's final #BlackMirror (C4, 10pm) is set in a mad fantasy world where people trust cartoon characters slightly more than politicians.
@LeefroMilch You're joking. The pope? Oh my god.
@ThomJames It IS Nathan Fake's 'You Are Here'. Fortdax remix.
Oh right, looks like Northern Ireland viewers who get the BBC HD channel can enter 'cheat mode' and watch the show at 10 after all.
@GurmeetSahni People reading too much into it imho. It's really just a creepy horror story I think.
@snuggleskunk No, I think they were just pissed off that it was raining all the time.
Viewers in Northern Ireland have to wait until 11.20pm, apparently. That's because BBC2 NI doesn't like the theme tune or something.
@lulzyboy You're on your own. Or you can pop along to the iPlayer.
This is your final reminder that Weekly Wipe is on BBC2 very shortly at 10pm, except for viewers in the afterlife.
@Hansplat Next week
Tonight! #WeeklyWipe! BBC2, 10pm! Asteroids! Kate! 007! Pope! Wonders of Life! Food! Key! Stanhope! Shitpeas! Cunk! Armstrong! Suttie! Etc!
Thursday, which is today, is Weekly Wipe day. BBC2, 10pm. Here's a glimpse: http://t.co/LbgPubq6gY
@DaftLimmy You missed all the good stuff. There was a shooting game and a goblin game and a game where you were a cork thing.
Have to go work on Weekly Wipe now. Some of the PS4 launch might end up in next week's show.
It's called the 'Pant Array' engine? #PS4
I don't think you need the cover story about "recreating dreams" though. #PS4
Why didn't they open with this? #PS4
Now this is more like it. #PS4
They've recreated William Hartnell on the PS4.
Polygon counts. Ahhh. Takes me back to my PC Zone days. #PS4
@hattiehattie It's a pretty good moody stare, no?
Call me a philistine, but that looked a bit like a puzzle-based Far Cry 3 running on the Wii. #PS4
I bet Jonathan Blow has really enjoyed all the games he's seen so far #PS4
Hope they announce Shaq-Fu 2 #fingerscrossed #PS4
I was interested in that until he got to the bit about superheroes #PS4
When am I going to look at the fibres in the chair I'm sitting on in my made up car in a computer game? Bloody hell. #PS4
Why are they incessantly focussing on the dullest features of every title? Prettier versions of things we've seen before. #PS4
@tdcm27 You are crying on Twitter.
Unbelievably boring #PS4
Killzone 4 looks like the aerial shots from The Apprentice so far  #PS4
Stream unwatchable now. I was looking forward to them announcing a reboot of Kokotoni Wilf or something. #PS4
It literally might as well come with an in-built walnut dispenser for all I care so far #PS4
KICK THE FUCKING SHARE BUTTON OFF NOW. DESTROY IT. PRISE IT OFF WITH A CLAW HAMMER. #PS4
@kierongillen Shh, I'm being a cunt about everything.
Dave Perry looks like he should be in The Only Way is Essex #PS4
EARTHWORM JIM MAN #PS4
It's going to force you to communicate with a bunch of smiley cunts when all you want to do is sit indoors alone playing, isn't it? #PS4
I'm sensing all this stuff is really interesting to developers and very dull to me. #PS4
@RyMacleod Fucking cork bastard. Corking great fuck.
So it's a game where you play a little cunt with a cork for a head? #PS4
Dunno if kicking off with a game where you fight a war with the goblins is going to do much for the wider image of gaming #PS4
You could animate some amazing vomit with that. #PS4
@prodnose I literally don't know who any of these 'The Brits' are
This is like a cutscene you can't skip #PS4
Screensavers during system updates! #PS4
Playstation 4 will have a tail. Can't see much value in that to be honest.
@kierongillen He's definitely leading towards that, this guy. "Better graphics".
Did Adam Curtis put this PS4 launch together?
Here, anyone who needs a spot of cheering up. Here's a brilliant classic cartoon: http://t.co/J851sWjj
@Sparkle__Monkey How's this?
@AlCampbeII Cheers Barry. "There was this Black Mirror thing, right, about how the internet's got a temper".
@RealReeceShears Haha, thank you.
@ell_jay_bee We just liked it. Heard it on a compilation album years ago.
@suzanne_moore It's not a very nice one tonight. Just a heads up.
Not long to go till tonight's #BlackMirror at 10pm. Hope you enjoy it.
@totalwaster Nope, they all stand alone
@brosephkirk Kind of depends on your mum.
There will be a brief pause before tonight's Black Mirror (C4, 10pm) for you to make yourself a nice cocoa or something and get comfortable.
@caitlinmoran That is the ideal viewing state. I might ask C4 continuity to recommend viewers develop a fever before watching.
On meteors and carcasses: http://t.co/NSveIOzZ
http://t.co/zljiBiiZ
Episode 2 of Black Mirror is called White Bear, and it's on C4, Mon at 10pm. There's a trailer here: http://t.co/2W8V506l
@EmmaKennedyAndr The horses were unclothed.
@maxlangley I'm going to obstinately take that as a compliment no matter what
@NigelHeath quick, make a hovercar out of polystyrene cups or something and film it against that backdrop. Instant sci-fi epic.
@mazzacampbell I'd say 'stark simple icon' myself. But what do I know?
@mazzacampbell it is, yes.
Night Twitter, I have to write a thing on the meteor and a horsemeat update by dawn or Weekly Wipe will have a gap in it.
@simonswatman They're not, they keep fucking dropping them.
@SortaFriends That's the folks at Painting Practice. Pretty sure it'll be real in about ooh six years.
@MindSpanking Didn't you see National Anthem?
@frogwoffa No, they are banned. They have to sit facing away from the screen I'm afraid. Those are the rules.
@jonronson You should watch that actually because it's about something that almost happened to YOU.
@jonronson Domnhall Gleeson is fantastic.
@caitlinmoran @laurenlaverne @petepaphides You need to download Freedom, software that shuts net connection. Only way Weekly Wipe gets done.
@macartney_mark We bleep me on purpose so I'm more Yosemite Sam than sweary old man.
@caitlinmoran @laurenlaverne @petepaphides Bet you still checked the word count every five minutes.
@Kartoonze Fortunately not.
@luke_morton None: most reports a tad misleading in that regard: it's a diff story Jesse's doing around same tech; his idea predates series.
@laurenkatehanna No pigs in it, I can say that much.
@JonnyLobster Tons of horsemeat. TONS of the stuff.
@olly_mill_mill Nope fraid not.
@JoOwl83 Apple, circa 2018, I'd guess.
@petepaphides @caitlinmoran @laurenlaverne I did have to stare at that cover for a while before I spotted it. Brain went all sorts of places
@lukesegrave Comparatively.
@caitlinmoran @laurenlaverne @gracedent Did Cher really get that tattooed on her bum? I sort of remember it, but am not sure if you're LYING
@msrnt There is a tiny bit of blood.
@Bethan_Rose Yeah, but it was a sort of romance. This one's more of a cautionary tale.
@SixGun77 This one especially, though.
@redahaq Nope, but I sort of wish it had been.
@Trun0Jay Yep hopefully I'll get round to it at end of series.
@DeborahJaneOrr If I crack another mirror joke, that's seven years bad luck.
On reflection I think this coming Monday's Black Mirror is probably not for the fainthearted.
@Phieinyourtea I'm sorry if you took it that way. Not our intention to upset people.
@RalphGurnsey I think five eps a week would kill me.
@Phieinyourtea ... and to be fair to society, I think it can and is changing. Anyway, as I say, no offence intended.
@Phieinyourtea I think I made my views on gay marriage pretty clear, ie am firmly in favour and think arguments against it are nonsense...
@Phieinyourtea The 'looking alike' joke was about another couple they showed on lots of diff. stations, nothing more. No offence intended.
Apparently this asteroid's going to pass so low we might be able to reach up and knock it out of the way with a broom.
If you missed Weekly Wipe last night you can watch it on the miraculous BBC iPlayer here: http://t.co/DyQipbqm
@rawflare It is, but I couldn't fit all the names in one tweet.
@WilliamJBarrett 'Insidious Nepotism' was the work-in-progress title, come to think of it.
@feedthedrummer That's the avatar.
@IBeGlen Nope.
@_MrsThatcher_ Wait till next week...
@lee_robbo A substance made of flesh.
@NadimMuslim So what do you think of the stories in this week's Take a Break?
So, on #WeeklyWipe on BBC2 in a few mins: Horsemeat, Bruce Willis, Gay Marriage, Take Me Out, Ant &amp; Dec, Key, Law, Herring, Shitpeas &amp; Cunk.
@Geeky_Disco WOW YOU HAVE SEEN THRU THE FUCKEN MATRIX MAN #mindblowing
@CurranKate It's not been on the fucking telly yet, give it time...
@itskitcowper That's a good idea.
Should I say 'Weekly Wipe' or #weeklywipe when on here? I just don't know.
@EosChater HUDSON CORK
Bruce Willis is on Weekly Wipe tonight. Well, footage of him is.
@Paper_Polly Thank you.
@AlCampbeII @forbesforbes @timkeyperson @simonweekes Yes. We used CGI. Sorry, Al.
@SongoftheOss DEFINITELY NOT
Sam Terroni, our unbeatable Weekly Wipe archive chief there in that last RT.
@JeremyClarkson Thank you. It's generally typed in a blind panic against the clock, so that's good to know.
@JeremyClarkson That's a clock.
@JeremyClarkson Thanks. By the way, what exactly is a "car"?
@BeigeHatstand tend to be far too cogent / funny
Why is the news now referring to horsemeat as a 'mislabelling' scandal? That's mislabelling in itself. 'Cunty food crisis' would be better.
@Herring1967 @ELTAuthor We've got a few shots of horsemeat which should have a similar effect.
Tonight's Weekly Wipe (BBC2, 10pm) is a Valentine's Day special. Oh no, hang on - it isn't. Contains horsemeat and shocking, copious nudity.
@OwainConnors Just a bit.
New Weekly Wipe tonight! BBC2! 10pm! Includes Horsemeat, Bruce Willis, Take Me Out, Gay Marriage, Shitpeas, Cunk, Herring, Law, Ant, Dec...
Announcement: http://t.co/nrA3BNsQ
Current BBC news site lead story is 'Horsemeat probe "will be relentless".' That's nice.
@giagia Mad Cow Disease was Illuminati attempt number one at forcing us to eat horsemeat.
@camillalong That sounds like the name of a terrible band.
It's going to turn out that the last time any of us ate actual cow was 1994, isn't it?
Here's a quick taste of the next episode of #blackmirror -- http://t.co/2W8V506l
If you missed episode 1 of Black Mirror S2 last night, it's here on 4oD: http://t.co/eg68sez8 - also repeated on 4Seven tonight I think.
So, Black Mirror: Be Right Back is on at 10pm, C4. Make yourself a nice cup of tea or something. Get some biscuits.
Tonight's #blackmirror was written just for you, Twitter. C4 10pm.
@danielmaier She should combine all four.
Some ppl asking if they need to have seen the first Black Mirror series in order to watch the second. No -- they're all standalone stories.
@Jonnyanderson11 Nope, they're all standaloners
You've got just about enough time to watch season one of Black Mirror for free here before season two starts on Monday: http://t.co/sqLKG5tv
@littleash88 Nope, each episode is a standalone tale.
@fergaldavey @michaelleung New one starts Monday
@michaelleung Maybe, but if you're in US and you use proxy, you can watch, say, Dead Set on Netflix UK with your US Netflix acct.
@ManMadeMoon I *think* USA types might be able to use http://t.co/aqnVdRAE to access Black Mirror on 4oD here: http://t.co/eg68sez8
@talkingtocactus @rolphus @ManMadeMoon Dunno if Black Mirror'll be picked up by a US channel. More likely now we have six episodes, though.
@suzanne_moore I haven't seen it, just read the synopsis though. I'd say they should remake it BUT FINDUS ALREADY HAVE.
Hey, that '¬£25' comment I made earlier wasn't supposed to be a 'pony' joke. Coincidence.
On the other hand, if thanks to the CONSPIRACY we've all unwittingly developed a taste for cannibalism, well that's overpopulation solved.
We won't be laughing when it turns out, inevitably, we've been eating people. That's where this is heading. Horse stuff = softening us up.
I'm not wasting the horsemeat joke on here, for God's sake. I could probably sell it for about, ooh, ¬£25.
I reckon I've thought of a new horsemeat joke. Pretty sure it's the only one remaining in the English language.
@imnotastudent I think it's because we submit the show to the BBC at the last minute. Having said that, we DO write scripts. Will ask.
@MitchellGSlater Don't piss yourself. Watch them in whatever order seems appropriate.
As well as latest Weekly Wipe being on iPlayer: http://t.co/YJwQCdgT -- overseas types can see it on YouTube: http://t.co/wCL5nqX1
Congratulations fuckface, Weekly Wipe episode 2 is on iPlayer now: http://t.co/YJwQCdgT
@PageFortyFive Arf arf. No digs at comic shops - or those who sail in them - from this end. Tweaking the nose of the coverage.
Also Shitpeas, Cunk &amp; Midwife. Weekly Wipe, 10pm, BBC2. End of promotional tweet.
New episode of Weekly Wipe on tonight at 10pm on BBC2. Contains Selfridges, Mali, Diet Coke hunks, Stanhope, Mortimer, Long, &amp; Take a Break.
@TabloidTruths it's shot in the corner of a pub.
New trail for episode one of Black Mirror series two: http://t.co/aAJ2IvDJ
If you missed Weekly Wipe, it's waiting for you on the iPlayer: http://t.co/yh8pdQMc
@yokeki feb 11
@jonartwalsh reckon there's some sort of contractual obligation
So, like, final reminder for Weekly Wipe at 10pm tonight on BBC2. As for me, I've got to work on next week's episode now.
@SixStringBassMF Cheer up!!!!!! LOL :))))))
Tonight on Weekly Wipe, BBC2 (&amp; HD) at 10pm: Splash, Guns, Django, Stanhope, Africa, Beyonce, Osman, Calman, Shitpeas, Cunk, Tweenies ETC.
Here's a typically upbeat trail for WEEKLY WIPE, which starts tonight on BBC2 at 10pm: http://t.co/RDzyF8y3
Weekly Wipe is also the first Wipe show to make it onto the BBC HD channel. Why the fuck you'd want to see me in HD is anyone's guess.
@RyMacleod Every 5.6 days
Weekly Wipe starts tomorrow (Thursday), BBC2 at 10pm. Sounds like poor toilet routine, but isn't. It's a new Wipe programme.
Here's a piece I've written about an army of unfollowers: http://t.co/U1oKIDws
Ashkenazi Jew? Then pls click: RT @elissarubins: Only 5 wks to save sisters life. Bone marrow donors needed. Pls RT http://t.co/ioFVHaga
Weekly Wipe starts this Thursday at 10pm BBC2. It's like 2012 Wipe, but weekly. That's what it's like.
You there. Have a look at this: https://t.co/ECG3l4KY
@notnixon Definitely
Wrote something for you to read while eating: http://t.co/6z94CZDg
Dammit apparently Sean Lock already pitched that on telly last night.
They should do a version of Splash where the pool is empty and the stars have to fill it with their own urine, vomit, etc on the way down.
@petepaphides Access US Netflix library: http://t.co/q6oFhIMs
@JudithFlanders They fuck you up, these algorithms. They may not mean to, but they do.
@WailQ Pretty certain I didn't dictate what you can or can't think about it.
It has also come to my attention that some think I was being sarky about Django Unchained in that piece. Nope, really really enjoyed it.
@LordEnus I liked it a lot
@laurenlaverne it would be a shame to concrete it over tbf
@GrindhouseDave Zzzzzzzzzzz
NB my column today - http://t.co/fWzQY0nH - was written prior to whole Burchillgate kerfuffle, and thus ain't a comment on that.
@Mrendatious Not how most people would see you; only how a few risible idiots might.
@PeteRiley1991 Django Unchained.
@BazWatson Pretty sure someone'll illegally farm it round the internet
Also, here is Monday's column. Yes, it was written before Burchillgate or whatever you want to call it. http://t.co/5zFLlCBt
@mjljlzschultz Much soonerish
@goggit No pigs in the second series, you'll be delighted to know.
@Alfonsomccann Very much so
@bobbyconnolly A little bit of self-satire in it, yes.
@Jaloopa23 Possibly all of them depending on your point of view.
@Anthony_North Not sure but probably spring(ish) for Cloth 2 then autumn(ish) for Cloth 3.
Black Mirror S2 ep titles: 'Be Right Back', 'The Waldo Moment', and 'White Bear'. C4 soonish. First series back on 4OD: http://t.co/SS0S8LrL
It's on quite soon, like weeks rather than months btw.
Oh look it's the first publicity still from the second series of Black Mirror: https://t.co/o3sSjVym -- doesn't give much away, but hey.
@lewstringer ooh I taught myself to cartoon by reading a 'How To Draw Cartoons' thing by Terry Bave in an IPC comic aged about 9.
@AaronWils I want more tiles?
@Tazzmaverick it basically is that.
Here is a handy guide to avoiding the norovirus I've written for the Guardian newspaper: http://t.co/9tuCH3pb
@Smokey_Penguin Gargle with warm salt water, often.
Great Mr. Selfridge cliffhanger: it's closing time and no one knows how to do a 'Z-reading' on the newly-invented cash register.
That French bloke's in Spiral. This is the longest he's gone without staring into a hacked-open ribcage since 2008.
If this was on the BBC they'd have to call it Mr. Generic Department Store.
Why is Mr Selfridge behaving like he's hosting Wheel of Fortune? It won't even be on for another 70 years.
Guess It's one way to reboot Are You Being Served.
I bet there's a bit where Mr. Selfridge invents the Soda Stream.
Can't help thinking this Selfridges thing has got 1970s fashion all wrong.
I hope it's a hit because I've been working on the story of Bob Comet.
I can't wait to see if Mr. Selfridge will ever open his shop.
@drbrake it could be uploaded by 500 diff ppl on YouTube. Why would the BBC waste time tracking lots of diff versions?
@GLove39 That's first on my list.
Weekly Wipe will be a sort of Omniwipe, encompassing Newswipe, Screenwipe, Gameswipe and 'Stuffwipe', for want of a better phrase.
@mojai3 See earlier tweets regarding that.
You have until the end of Tuesday to withstand 2012 Wipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/BtRSIDUa Then 'Weekly Wipe' begins in a few weeks.
@albionics Whereas you come across quite, quite brilliantly in your tweet.
@Christabelius Don't think we haven't tried. Games will be covered in Weekly Wipe though.
@ABCtech @winehusband ah yes but are these shows abc has uploaded itself? When the Wipe shows go on YT it's someone doing it unofficially.
@richardblogger iplayer most accurate of all. YouTube = show could be uploaded in multiple forms by multiple users, hard to monitor.
@winehusband The BBC don't put it on YouTube. They don't monitor how many people watch it there.
@sheepskinstu We bleep me deliberately as it makes me a bit Yosemite Sam
... watch that version if you can as then it counts towards viewing figures for BBC. More viewers = more chance of 2013 Wipe, 2014 Wipe etc.
Okay 2012 Wipe should be back on the iPlayer now. BTW, don't mind ppl watching on YouTube instead, but while it's on iPlayer best to...
@albertdeathkid He sleeps in a wheelbarrow under a bridge
2012 Wipe may have been temp taken off iPlayer for tech reason but will reappear soon if not immediately. But hurry anyway, few days left.
@ThemeparkRidley Think it's down temporarily for a technical reason
@sandandglue @prodnose Do you mean 'The Gonk' by Herbert Chappell?
@camillalong Because the outrage is so intense, it has ruptured the fabric of the space-time continuum.
That's Queen the band I'm referring to, not our monarch, obviously. If you thought otherwise you have a disgusting and traitorous mind.
QUEEN-FUCKINGLY OUTRAGEOUS RT @TimesNewsdesk: Channel 4 to repeat show with lewd joke about Queen http://t.co/fgCI4EjP
2012 Wipe on iPlayer, for UK viewers: http://t.co/BtRSIDUa  -- and on YouTube, for overseas types: http://t.co/ysoCDPUV
@CasuistsTome *cough* http://t.co/ysoCDPUV
@spittingcat @caracompass Now, now. Let's not fight.
@MacDragon Oh yes I did.
@CaraCompass That tweet has reminded me that I forgot to put Gangnam Style in and will do so now.
@sxtyfootmalcolm allwipe
@emalcolmson no particular reason. bleeping my swearing fits my cartoon persona.
@SeanKDLA It's a pub.
@KathW80 2 more of them on the way.
@verypaullewis Touch of Cloth 2 &amp; 3 all done and ready to go.
Updated the Wipe Spotify playlist with music used in 2012 Wipe, for all your "what was that track" needs: http://t.co/m2HHFbrm
@FitzmauriceJ He's in it every week, yes.
@RyMacleod None. I promise to start Dark Souls presently. Presently.
@MattKamen All of the above.
@VeganBen Fret not, someone'll lob it on YouTube and then you can dig in. It's probably already torrented too.
There's a new Wipe series starting in about 4 weeks.
@riazat_butt Star Wars? Star Wars? Star Wars? Star Wars?
@brain_opera Had to keep checking what year everything was myself.
@Sparkle__Monkey Ha, already updated the previous playlist
Here's 2012 Wipe on iPlayer: http://t.co/BtRSIDUa
@TinPotRay nah, it's on after that if you know where to look
@acangelcats4 ah, but finding it in the tangled web of 'other channel', that's the challenge
As far as I can tell we're not in the HD channel for some mad reason: odd as they made us shoot in HD. LICENCE PAYER'S WASTED PIXELS.
@tara_mcevoy it's on tomorrow for you - or try 865 on virgin / 969 on Sky
Viewers in Norn Ireland: it's on tmrw for you OR try ch 865 Virgin Media / 969 on Sky...
Last continuity announcement: 2012 Wipe's on BBC2 in a few mins; iPlayer shortly after.
@Gareth_Daniels I can tell you the scores if you like.
@Hennessy_79 February
@RMajor86 dunno, since they made us shoot it in HD
@LudditeWebDev No, I do that bit. He does Leveson.
@PaBo8267 sadly not: we tried but he was busy
@jamiethelanky qualifying as a pilot
On 2012 Wipe, BBC2, 10pm tonight we have Mr @DougStanhope, Barry Shitpeas and expert opinion from a new Wipe signing: Miss Philomena Cunk.
@bresers it is tomorrow
@cultcinemasun weirdly it seems not, although it was shot in HD
Mind you, enterprising NI viewers with a satellite dish or the Internet can find means of viewing it 'live' tonight at 10pm.
@risingdream That's cos it hasn't been broadcast yet. Should be on iplayer shortly after TX
@hattiehattie I hope they call it Kelloggs
Northern Ireland viewers: you have to wait an extra 24 hours for 2012 Wipe because the BBC hates you. That's the official reason apparently.
@ulster_fry You get it tomorrow for some mad reason
@ricpussayshot It's not been on before. Ironically the Virgin guide clearly knows nothing about first times.
2012 Wipe is on tonight at 10pm on BBC2. You will need: television, chair, eyesight.
@paddycullivan If you've got a satellite dish I reckon you could manage it. Otherwise it's on the next night for NI
@Home5ickAlien it's on tomorrow
@NafsikaT Yes that was part of the joke
Some very handy new phrases for Twitter users: http://t.co/njPON3Hg
@craigkendrick tomorrow at 10, bbc2
@alivesey8692 Two more 90min Cloth tales coming 2013
'Fiscal Cliff' is a great pornstar name.
Here's something @rhysthomasobe made ten years ago - long enough to make it genuine nostalgia: http://t.co/gH71aW4o
@BobbyFriedman New Year's Day sunshine
Here's a big bunch of new words created specifically for you: http://t.co/WecsfV87
Wow Midnight in Paris is making me hate a wide variety of historical figures.
@senandthecity NEW YEAR'S DAY!!!!???!!!
@Honahonis yes, January; also 2012 Wipe new year's day
@RhysThomasOBE @RealReeceShears @mrchrisaddison Rhys I swear you should write an encyclopaedia of forgotten shows
@dannybark New Year's Day, 10pm, BBC2
@mrchrisaddison and Straw Dogs is basically Cornish Night of the Living Dead
Home Alone 3 is on. It's basically Straw Dogs.
@caitlinmoran Deadline boo hoo. You should've done it earlier. Too busy penning transphobic antigay racist pamphlets as usual I'm guessing.
@notBloss You just have to adjust your filter so those bits don't register
@lynch_69 and dustbins, yes
@Sambell710 New Year's Day, 10pm, BBC2
@caitlinmoran Seen Hot Runnings, the sequel in which John Candy goads a ragtag team of diarrhoea sufferers into drinking pints of olive oil?
I see the criminally underwatched sci-fi classic Silent Running is on Film Four at 12.55pm. That's your Sunday afternoon treat, that is.
@cubious ah righto. I tend not to ever click any link anyone sends me ever, in case it's video of a murder or something
@cubious I assume that reply is far too cool for me to comprehend
@The_Nickster200 New series this Jan
@brain_opera The bit where he laughs madly at all the sentient furniture is one of the best scenes ever filmed.
@HadleyFreeman What's wrong with that? It looks fucking brilliant
@Geofrey_Butler congratulations x10000
@Geofrey_Butler Apart from all the replies, that is.
@fragz BBC2, New Year's Day, 10pm
