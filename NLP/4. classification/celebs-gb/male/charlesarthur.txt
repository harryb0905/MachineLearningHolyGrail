@pipterino yes! It’s brilliant. And terrifying.
@calmandfearless *surviving* that is worth a zillion Oscars.
wow the smell of burning rubber as Labour frontbench executes stunning u-turn on whether they’d campaign for 2nd referendum and Remain. Going to be fun for the Lexit crew, though, isn’t it.
@JNRaeside I am yelping with laughter
@steven_odb @_ChrisHarris yup
@jameslenoel TV broadcasters in particular are strictly regulated by Ofcom to be impartial. If you’re suggesting TV coverage (which most people watch) drove a Tory minority result, you’re in denial.
@jameslenoel he’s not “gently ribbing”. Listen to the tone as he gets into his stride. He’s fomenting outrage that he should be asked about the thing which he directly controls, the Labour Party, instead of something he doesn’t, which is the country.
@BelgianWaffling I cannot believe it has taken you this long, given.. you know.
@jayrosen_nyu now, “un-equals”, that would have been worth it.
@jayrosen_nyu fairly sure that at least one word, possibly two (if “co-“ counts as a word) in “team, co-equals” is surplus.
Thus immortalising himself in GIFs to be attached to social media posts about exam results, new houses, new babies, marriages, sharp comebacks, etc etc. The man’s a genius. https://t.co/MIkvNmwj9G
@CraigGrannell insufficient parliamentary time to get things through already, I believe. They will need an extension come what may.
@cyberdyne oh man it is tough to live it.
@_ChrisHarris that’s Huawei, which put out a “3D Touch” phone two weeks before Apple, and then promptly forgot about it five minutes later. I think they’ll discover this when it hits users, and an “innie” will be the next iteration.
Prediction: nothing at all is happening, and May will have nothing new to offer MPs in statement tomorrow. (That’s why she put off “meaningful vote”.) Hasn’t anyone grasped that she just talks “Brexit means Brexit” nonsense that offers nothing concrete to judge her by? https://t.co/WWifqKzTUa

@pjbryant it varies
@neilcybart @reneritchie sure - but they’re all about surviving the short term.
@neilcybart @reneritchie Oh, sure. But I think there are lots of OEMs out there who are praying for something, anything to justify generally higher ASPs, esp for Android. They’ll ride the coattails of foldables upping it happily.
@AndrewOrlowski And it’s plastic, ofc. That’s going to need a.. case?
Exactly a year ago we’d just been hit by the “Beast from the East”, bringing exceptionally low temperatures and tons of snow. (https://t.co/anK8F622kB) Huge variability and disordered polar vorticies are the new “normal”. https://t.co/9rogHM3wbF
@neilcybart @reneritchie though foldables do hit two SPs: higher ASP, and USP compared to any other phone. (Apart from the other foldables obv.) Question now is how scratch-resistant that plastic is. Recall the iPod nano’s super-scratchable screen. This could be fun.
@katebevan I wonder if the same people telling us you can’t do real work on tablets are the ones telling us you need a foldable phone that becomes a tablet.
@AndrewOrlowski The screen scratches on both sides of.. the outside? Or both the inside and outside scratch?
@alexhern Yeah. That is going to be a good one to follow up on in about six months. Though I expect the yowling one will hear from the scratched and screwed will be pretty loud from day 2.
@dpfrank07 Don’t know. Nobody has been able to get their hands on them for long enough to really explain this in any detail.
Which raises the obvious question: why did Samsung go for the “inside fold” (bigger screen is inside when folded) rather than the “outside fold”? https://t.co/BtEEGGUrmg

@roryobryan @oblong go back and look at the original clip. Labour has a huge problem with antisemitism. He leads the party. He has lost MPs because of it. It’s a crisis. So what does he not want to talk about? The antisemitism problem and what he will do about it - the things he controls.
@roryobryan @oblong I think that, like Trump, he would prefer a compliant media. RT. Press TV That’s his sort of channel. Look at all the interviews he gave them.
@roryobryan @oblong if Trump were saying that the MSM only want to talk about the latest member of his cabinet found fiddling expenses etc or asking why he says there were “good people on both sides” at Charlottesville instead of the job numbers, you’d have the comparison correct.
@roryobryan @oblong Trump too would say “oh they didn’t ask me about [irrelevant topic X], let me tell you about [irrelevant topic X].” [Goes on to talk about irrelevant topic X, never tackles relevant question.]  The other points are for those saying “well, he’s talking about what he’d do.”
@jameslenoel he likes the idea of a “powerful media” as long as it doesn’t ask him uncomfortable questions about why he doesn’t root out antisemitism and bullying in the party that he controls. Then he gets all huffy. I’m not persuaded he likes a free media. He likes it compliant.
@jameslenoel You’re supporting someone who wants to impose state control of media? Seems like you don’t understand what a free media looks like.
@PenLlawen @DrPizza ummm. I always thought the Columbo schtick was about the apparent harmlessness. She seems anything but harmless. (So many great people worked on Columbo. Spielberg directed at least one episode. It was a fabulous series.)

@sogrady Aliens is the worst film of the franchise. Stupid people doing stupid things. Alien is a masterpiece. Aliens is the ecce homo.

@johngapper @HadleyFreeman @EvanHD @giles_fraser @unherd questions too about prevalence of parents who retire to sunnier climes.

@AlanBruuuuce ah, this is why nobody interacts with you. Goodbye.
@AlanBruuuuce “Lost earnings” through care must include cleaning. Or is there some special divide of “care” where the elderly are able to clean their own homes but their young “care” for them? It’s a nonsense. Either you accept that you pay some people for their labour, or you don’t. https://t.co/vltaacqEPE
@AlanBruuuuce You assumed that. I didn’t say it and I wasn’t thinking it. The racism is in your head.
@jamesrbuk This is like telling people not to think about the elephant.
@nef601 I feel he started from the wrong conclusions and worked backwards to the premise.
@PaulGuinnessy The mysteries of marketing budgets and the Academy are known to few.
@AlanBruuuuce You’re the one doing that. He is saying that one should never pay for help. That applies to cleaners of whatever origin.  You could have asked me, but you leapt to a conclusion. You were wrong. Apology will be fine.
@PaulGuinnessy There are always lots of great performances - it can be about how big the marketing budget is to get it in front of academy voters.
Unreal. The stupid assumptions in this. What of people without children or relatives? Ever hear of elderly retiring to other countries? And of course one should never pay for help.

@kortebortor @tsecrime you can get an app called Authy which syncs over a number of devices - doesn’t need to be your phone. That makes it even *more* useful as you can change acct details after theft. A better question is how likely your phone is to be stolen v your likelihood of getting phished.

@StephenFollows there’s an inherent flaw in using Rotten Tomatoes (or ImDB or any of those) as a measure: self-selecting group does the ratings.

@bloggmeister yup
@afwaller @counternotions whaaaaaat is that. I hadn’t noticed it.
@WaltFrench @counternotions don’t really like that idea.
@fipunchard Martina has done the research. That’s what her article says. Did you actually trouble to read the extracts?  What is there that “needs more research”? We know what pubertal testosterone does. We know what physiology does in certain sports. (See illo in earlier tweet.) End of.
@WaltFrench nicely played
@AndyKilpatrick7 as others are saying, Brexit likely doesn’t help at all.
@fipunchard looking at McKinnon, she has a lot of extra body mass to move compared to competitors. They will never, ever get thighs like that, no matter how long or hard they train.
@fipunchard that’s an absurd argument. The point is that there are physiological differences between men and women, and pubertal testosterone is a big part of it. Hence differences in physique-dominated sports. https://t.co/2lZLDI9Qyn
@AndyKilpatrick7 that seems to be a big part of it, yes. But equally, they have a lot of skilled workers in Swindon with experience, so why not build a big new factory that’s right in the heart of Eur…. oh.

@sevitz yes, I think that’s reasonable. The question now becomes who would invest there? Why would you invest in a country that’s just on the edge of the EU? It’s like investing in ……Ukraine?
@fipunchard the evidence comes from simple  biology. Testosterone during puberty leads to different body shape, muscle mass, bone mass. McKinnon has only been racing for *three years*. And set a WR aged 37? That’s pubertal testosterone advantage. https://t.co/HJB6MiBp2e

@UmbertoBagg actually I think the frame rate is consistent. It seems to slow down because it gets closer to the camera.
@UmbertoBagg one could get down to counting frames. It’s more that he reacts fast, but it’s happened before he realises it.
@fybee look at running. Men’s mile record: 3.43. Women’s mile record: 4.12. Half a minute. That’s gigantic. That’s pubertal testosterone effects: muscle mass, bone length, body shape.
@fybee that is why I mentioned Gooren and Bunk. Because they’re in that study. But Martina’s article points out that that ignores pubertal effects of testosterone, which aren’t reversible, and do confer advantage.  It’s not about *during* comps. It’s about *before* comps. Years before.
@arno_sosna Beats? Apple doesn’t do high-profile acquisitions. Beats was very much the exception. Many of its hardware tech comes from acquisition - first touchscreen, TouchID, FaceID among them.  Just because you don’t notice doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.

@kentindell @internetthought I have been promised fibre broadband for the past two years. There are ducts, but no fibre, installed end of last year. Patience, grasshopper.
@fybee That Loughborough meta-study really doesn’t grapple with her points. Gooren+Bunck study (23) is the most relevant: “Androgen deprivation in transgender female individuals increases the overlap in muscle mass with women but does not reverse it”. Eg: powerlifting; tennis; cycling.
@kentindell @internetthought That’s strange, it doesn’t struggle with my 2MB/s downlink.
@fybee Have you read Martina’s article? She’s talking about elite participation, and has looked at actual studies of metabolism and pubertal development. Her point is that where bone mass and pubertal development confer an advantage, it would make the sport unfair.
@ScreenjabberStu No! That would be cruel. A little shorter under the belly.

@NigelSarbutts Why would it, though? Honda’s under no requirement to tell it about its sensitive commercial plans.
The Honda announcement really isn’t about Brexit; even if in a sort of self-harming schadenfreude (schadenfreudeseppuku?) one might want it to be. It is about the car industry trying to cope with dramatic shifts in demand location and type, esp electric cars.

What happens to the Tories’ party-within-the-party, the ERG (“European Reform Group”) after Brexit? Do they dry up and wither away, like UKIP?   Or do they have other non-European madness they want to inflict that isn’t simply Tory policy?
@savoirsarthe I don’t know, though I do see trucks with carbon neutral signs (or ambitions) for various companies. It’s a good question.
@kylefilegriffin In the group studied, it did.
@Reynolds Why can’t it be extrapolated?
@ravi_hiranand Ah, now that is a more promising possibility.

@JohnLamont it isn’t entirely - possibly not even substantially - about Brexit. As Simon Jack pointed out, the new EU-Japan trade deal removes tariffs and so might make it simpler to import from Japan. Plus falling demand for diesel.
@andrewchen the whole of that book of short stories is amazing. I loved the superintelligence one.
Love how the news has union leaders condemning MPs exiting the Brexit-enabling Corbyn cult, soon followed by union leaders condemning Honda leaving Swindon.  Simon Jack really good (as usual) on this: UK-Japan relationship of the past 30 years is broken.

@cathcam but they don’t have the numbers or the leverage to persuade the subscription sites to sign up. Apple News drives millions of views, and it’s only in three countries.
@cathcam look up Texture, the app/company that Apple bought which is going to be rolled into this.
@cathcam too much hassle. *You* have already complained about getting subscription fatigue. Simpler: a monthly payment which gives you access to all the things you see. One transaction, all access.
@cathcam that’s the Apple News model, sure.

@Reynolds Which is why I did suggest listening to the Exponent podcast. Which explains: for mid-tier players, it’s all additive - they in effect get money for free (costs nothing to be there). Tracking readers is great, but getting paid is nice first of all.
@Reynolds If you’re annoyed by multiple subscriptions, then surely the Apple offer of “subscribe once here, get access to all those things” is just what you want. I mean define fail in the context of this thing. It’s easy to say a thing that shuts has “failed”.

@Bacolod @christopherhope it would make sense not to accelerate the changes that will harm us irrevocably. Saying “the climate will change” isn’t a rebuttal.
@ColinMin63 @christopherhope it’s about awareness. Politicians show little awareness - as evidenced by May scolding them - of the importance of this topic. It will matter to those children. Your view can be discounted because you won’t be living through it.
@GreasyGrassI876 @christopherhope given how useless politicians have shown themselves over a comprehensible topic - Brexit - it points to an utter inability to deal with a serious one, specifically climate change.
@GreasyGrassI876 @christopherhope try a search on “insect dieoff”. You’ll find scientists have been finding this and expressing concern for multiple years. We just haven’t been listening because we’ve been wasting time on an utterly trivial topic about where laws get voted on.
@GreasyGrassI876 @christopherhope the scientists aren’t qualifying what they’re saying. They’re pretty sure it’s an extremely serious situation with global implications. Are you describing the scientist who spoke on Inside Science? He wasn’t happy.
@Bacolod @christopherhope Climate change is real and is already killing species. Cherrypicking idiots who cherrypick data won’t change that, but it will delay the necessary political action.
@ColinMin63 @christopherhope they’re going to be living through situations you helped cause long after you’re dead. Don’t tell people who are taking action it’s the wrong sort of action when you do less than nothing.
@GreasyGrassI876 @christopherhope science can only analyse what is known, but the datasets are robust. We don’t have much data for Russia and India and China. However, if you’re hoping that they’re being overrun by insects while they vanish elsewhere, you’re fooling yourself.
@PirtesHa @unapower try this for logic. Insect dieoff will lead to ecosystem collapse. This is what climate change does.  https://t.co/rSBf92TEtD
@christopherhope If the story about insect dieoff didn’t worry you very deeply, then you should listen to people - scientists - whom it did. And then realise that criticising children who are concerned about the biggest threat to our and their way of life is irredeemably foolish and shortsighted.

@Errol_Flynn_ Ta.
@benfenton @emilybell @nevali @jamesrbuk @arusbridger I think today one might try to get it to go viral on Facebook and then write about that. This is like talking about ecosystem collapse when you’re down to the last breeding pair. Hard to see how you really get it back.
@Errol_Flynn_ Ha, that’s neat. How much, where from?
@oitappin It’s convenience and simplicity. I’m off running with music setting my pace on a playlist while you’re grumbling about sound quality and “style over substance”. AirPods got me fitter. That’s not mediocrity.
@emilybell @benfenton @nevali @jamesrbuk @arusbridger By contrast I give you Grenfell and the blog that complained about the failings for months before the fire. The reporting (not by journalists) was there. The attention wasn’t.  I don’t have any simple answers though.
@Errol_Flynn_ Criticising AirPods for not having the sound quality of a pair of £200 over-the-ear wired headphones uses exactly the wrong axes for critique, I think. Convenience; portability; connectivity; simplicity. Even price.
@Errol_Flynn_ See also: MP3s. “The sound isn’t as good as a CD but I can carry all my record collection on this iPod..”
@benfenton @nevali @emilybell @jamesrbuk Tbh what I see in the market town near me is that *citizens* are watching and writing annoyed letters to the two (!) local papers. Transcripts of council meetings should be done by councils at their expense. Some people will trawl them.
@PaulGuinnessy It’s true. They are remarkable.
@benfenton @nevali @jamesrbuk @emilybell Afraid I hate the idea of “kitemarking”. Who the hell decides? Let the market do that work. To Emily’s point - very local papers(at town level) can survive, just about. But it’s never going to be top-class stuff. Was it ever though?
@nechbi How do you distinguish them? Length of stem? The fakes are longer?

@bryanrieger but the details about the playlists etc is your data, and when you end the contract you end Apple’s contractual right to retain the data. So it deletes that data. Seems odd to suggest they should retain your data after you end your business relationship.
@mwarhurst @WhichUK @WhichPress email them!
@mwarhurst odd as you say that there aren’t ways to veto apps. But that would interfere with the business model where they get paid to include the apps.
@bryanrieger it’s a contract you entered into voluntarily, and it’s pointing out the consequences of not renewing the contract - where both courses are also voluntary. “Gangster”?
@mwarhurst then again, what % of parents use parental controls? Physical is the best defence.
@mwarhurst it.. sort of can? 1) don’t put the TV in the kids’ bedroom 2) don’t connect the TV to the network
@WillardFoxton that is so sad. Deepest condolences, Willard.

@pjbryant 20-20 hindsight. Would Corbyn have done as well then? He could have stood for leader at that time and tried to reform Clause 4 etc. Bet he wouldn’t have though, and New Labour would have been Old Labour, and failed.
@stjohnbaptiste and you! May the coffee be with you.
@stjohnbaptiste Amazing that May hasn’t plumbed the depths yet. But give her time, I guess. April isn’t far away.
@DarrenGriffin @ruskin147 the best solution is to limit apps to App Store only, but of course that’s a “don’t start from here” solution.
@Norro21 Afghanistan was always an easier sell than Iraq, certainly. The WMD angle became the prime narrative because it seemed like existential threat. But also because we had held back from Iraq in Desert Storm. So sure, agree.
@stjohnbaptiste so basically there was a lot of hatin’ goin’ on.
@DarrenGriffin @ruskin147 I don’t use any of them! They slow the machine, and there’s a built-in malware removal tool (mrt at the command line) - like Windows Defender.
So Tony Blair’s “satisfaction rating” was, at worst, -30 while PM. (Compared to +6 “worst” while Opposition leader.) Yet John Major did even worse in 1993. Post-ERM crash, I’m guessing. https://t.co/auk0eGlH05
@DarrenGriffin @ruskin147 hmmmm there are plenty of others, and I wouldn’t go for that one necessarily.
@_richardheath @mikegalsworthy I think that’s why it says “under management”.

@ruskin147 What platform is that on?
@drs1969 @sarahkendzior Thank you!
@NoDPI Looking forward to you finding that
@pjbryant As it says
@jontringham Yup
@Norro21 Genuine question(s): how do you think the UK should have handled participation in (a) Afghanistan (b) Iraq?
@davidjs_uk No joke, I’d take him back in a heartbeat.

@mdudas yes. They’re safe (how many lives lost from TMI? Zero), carbon-neutral, long-lived, reduce fossil fuel use over longer term, bring highly skilled jobs to locations.
@reneritchie @JohnPaczkowski @markgurman @MichaelSteeber yeah. None of the detail around this suggests she was pushed out. Cook’s tweet, the Vogue interview… Execs are people too, especially with families. $30m per year? She’s already rich. But kids only grow up once.

@DavidFrost95 @ed_baker @Utahdesigner @conservmillen That is definitely true.
@ed_baker @Utahdesigner @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen only if you think science is a religion. Not believing what science tells us - that’s what religion does: from Galileo to Darwin, science keeps coming up with ideas that people find unpopular. Science doesn’t care.
@DavidFrost95 @ed_baker @Utahdesigner @conservmillen amazing indifference to scientific processes you’re showing there. The planet’s atmosphere was CO2 before oxygen-generating organisms, sure. Want to live then?  Anyway, try reading the link I posted with an open mind, rather than ignoring reality.
@ed_baker @Utahdesigner @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen The IPCC - calm, rational, international panel of climate scientists - is the one saying without serious action, in 12 years it’s irreversible. I’m quoting their concerns.  Read the reports.  https://t.co/WKCrGtLkSp
@DavidFrost95 @Utahdesigner @ed_baker @conservmillen Ask the IPCC. A team of expert scientists. What’s your qualification?
@Utahdesigner @ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen What’s the choice? Present trajectory becomes irreversible in 12 years’ time. Do you hate your kids that much?
@PaulGuinnessy @TPpodcast_ I do like the method of using satellite monitoring to establish what’s true about China.
@jimbomorrison Ooh clever pun
@ulliverti Nah they’re already complaining that Vodafone should do the same as Three and suck up the charges. Gov minister yest said to prevent it would force those not going to Europe to pay for those who were. All in it together, eh.
@Nwo_slave @ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen And you’re an IT professional! Sure you meet many many intelligent and influential people doing that, especially in Idaho.  Read up on climate change. If you’re not worried, work on your comprehension level.
@Nwo_slave @ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen Just because it’s difficult doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done. Going to the moon wasn’t possible in 1961. It was in 1969. What made it happen? Motivation.
@Nwo_slave @ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen Nice to know I’m in charge of transport. Wellll I’ve heard there are things called “trains” which can run on electricity, deliver to depots, you could distribute from there by electric-powered trucks. If diesel’s price increases 200-fold, I’m sure folks will figure it out.
Interesting by @jon_rauch and @Peter_Wehner which also introduces (I think) the word “Trexit”. During Watergate I guess it would have been “Nixit”. https://t.co/gnKxnELuPw https://t.co/7z7ZVyrZAP
@JustinList Kinect was a singular failure because the UI was madness. For anyone who thinks that voice control is an impenetrable command line, show them gestures.
@JustinList seriously, nobody uses TVs for Facetime. (Cameras in TVs is a terrible security risk too. Is why TV manufacturers gave it up.) You have a device in your hand which can do that. Or Facebook will sell one for your kitchen counter.
@PaulGuinnessy @TPpodcast_ believe that’s no longer the case.
It’s pretty easy to argue that both main political parties have been captured by extremists - Tories within Parliament, Labour outside it. Which leaves sensible people like @lucianaberger having to fight off antisemite insanity. https://t.co/yFoxzei7T5

@drs1969 Blimey. Is that written up somewhere?

@dancharles @ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen solar panels have a typical life of 20 years. Nobody buys any with five-year lives.

@a_r_j_u_n_e don’t overestimate how eager people actually are to drop subs. Especially if Spotify says, as it would, that the labels were trying to rip them off. Recall how Microsoft let it out about labels wanting money for the Zune. Not good PR for labels.
@a_r_j_u_n_e Well, it could get to the place where Spotify might choose - or threaten - not to license their music. It’s not in the labels’ interests to try that.

@ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen “Other dystopias are available”.
@DavidFrost95 @ed_baker @conservmillen Nuclear fusion already works… but isn’t able to self-sustain. Always 20 years off.
@ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen “you are hilariously oversimplifying every possible aspect of completely and arbitrarily overhauling an entire society” I didn’t say it will be easy. The alternative is a sort of rolling slow civil war as coastal inhabitants head inland looking to live while crops fail. Pick one.
@ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen You only have to do it once. Solar panels sit there and work. Ditto the others. No mining or pipelines to keep feeding them.
@DavidFrost95 @ed_baker @conservmillen The risks of nuclear are wayyyyy overblown. In reality, more people die from particulates from coal than have ever died from nuclear. The waste is a pain but manageable. Thorium reactors (or, fingers crossed, fusion 🙏) even better.
@DavidFrost95 @ed_baker @conservmillen You’re forgetting hydro, tidal, wind, wave, nuclear. All getting cheaper than many fossil. Coal is pricier already.
@ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen Solar panels. Hydro. Nuclear (even though that GND doesn’t like it.) Tidal. Wave. Wind.
@DavidFrost95 @ed_baker @conservmillen He said “avocado trains”. I think electric trains would work fine. With avocados on if necessary.
@ed_baker @DavidFrost95 @conservmillen There’s this thing called “electricity” which you can generate from all sorts of methods and it will power trains and other systems.  200 years ago lighting came from whale blubber. They laughed at this “petroleum” stuff. And how could you pipe it? As for electricity - deadly!

@ed_baker @lachlan The science isn’t in question. Ice melts, atmosphere heats up, climate changes.
It’s quite a thing to consider which of these tweets is actually about a topic that’s both urgent and important. (There’s only one.) No disrespect to the authors of any of them, but it shows how we distract ourselves. https://t.co/uf9oJlCOBF
@lachlan @ed_baker consider the alternative: in ten years’ time, you’re going to have to begin considering how to rehouse all the people in low-lying areas of the US. (That might happen anyway.) Climate change is like a slow meteor. Doesn’t depend on if you think it exists. Only whether you act.
@request_d @tomwarren what are you, a bat? Humans are meant to live in the light.

@RHAVote @espiers Having read the paper - and having read lots of scientific papers to write stories from them - I’d have missed it. And I was looking for it. See if you can find where they say their study omits important data about fetal abnormality abortions/death risk. https://t.co/oQKa3TJbOg
@carlosmoffat @TheOverspill @crimetown Consider that they pay about 70%++ of their revenue directly to labels just for the joy of playing a song, and it’s not hard to imagine that podcasts could get a payout and still be profitable.
@magi_jay That’s a disastrously bad writeup by the study authors. That limitation isn’t mentioned until right at the very end, in a throwaway line. I’ve read many, many scientific papers for journalism, and never seen such a huge hole so hidden. (Though maybe I overlooked them because…)
It’s also (as I pointed out in today’s @theoverspill) about Spotify v the cost of playing podcasts, rather than licensed music. If you use Spotify to listen to podcasts rather than music, it doesn’t have to pay royalties, so it makes money rather than struggling. https://t.co/kWnUpHtI5p
@teroterotero Soon it will only be you and I

@vowe Seems like the message was couched more to be heard by Brexiters.
@gadget_freak he’s too experienced to simply blurt it out. The fact it was on Twitter too word-for-word is indicative that it was something planned.
@BrianCathcart true. Does it increase the chances/risk of No Deal? Or does it push HMG toward just pushing May’s deal through somehow? Seems to me it raises risk of No deal.
@ballantine70 @szmelly did they need telling?  I’d have gone for something like “trying to peel off the Brexiters from the UK govt.”
@gadget_freak I’d hope he was playing a deeper game than that.
@szmelly he knew that his quote would trigger the Brexiters. So what was his purpose in doing that?
@ACAElliott he is not a man who makes slips when standing at a lectern.
@dfarb it won’t happen.
@ottocrat so what does he believe his audience gets from that?
@ACAElliott what do you think the “real” something would be?
I’d be interested in a diplomat’s take on *why* Donald Tusk said what he did when he did.  It wasn’t accidental or impromptu; went out on his Twitter feed immediately. So it’s part of a negotiating ploy. How does it help him? That must be his calculus.
@jcinnamond have been hearing it, but useful. Ta.
@oaedoel I’d trust it to be a real conversation that he heard, because he’s an extremely reliable reporter. Your desire to wish it away says more about you than him.

@adhall_msft @edbott I love how they Could.Not.Resist including a picture of AOC.
@stuartdelaval I trust him. I don’t trust you. This is all it boils down to. Your username has no public presence beyond here. There’s no LinkedIn profile of that name (Delaval or De Laval). You’ve demonstrated no expertise. You clearly like shitposting on Twitter. You have no reputation.

@stuartdelaval I can’t find an occasion where you’ve commented on the GFA’s implications for trade, logistical implications of the backstop, or shipping flows from the continent to the UK. Lots on abortion, and right-wing junk. Zero demonstration of international logistics knowledge.
@stuartdelaval As I said, I have no indication of your reputation or knowledge except the contradiction in your location and what you tweet about, your lack of profile picture, and lack of indication of any specialist knowledge on this topic shown by your tweets. All of which count against you.
@stuartdelaval He’s a reliable journalist, and doesn’t have any reason to make something up: it would damage his reputation. Everyone who is denying it, meanwhile, has a desperate wish for it not to be true that US companies might move out of Britain, or for Brexit to have any negative effects.
@stuartdelaval The conversation took place. I’ve known Ian for 20 years. He’s an enormously reliable journalist. If you’re accusing him of lying, you can go away and never bother me again. Your reputation, meanwhile, is unclear: you tweet about Ireland yet claim to be in Tel Aviv. Uh-huh.
@stuartdelaval They said they do. Deal with it. Again, you’re trying to deny something that actually happened by making up vague reasons why it could be better. This isn’t how reality works. Perhaps they’ve been in the UK forever, pre-EU. Perhaps the language alignment helps. You don’t know.
@stuartdelaval Perhaps the impex requires localisation or checking. Perhaps they’re comparatively small and haven’t found any reason to have a continental office. Until now.  Try listening to what reliable people say instead of fantasising that you know they’re wrong.
@stuartdelaval Perhaps they have an HQ and/or bonded warehouse in the UK? Are you seriously suggesting that no goods arrive in the UK directly from the US? We have seaports and airports. I thought this was why we were going to be trading with all of everywhere post-Brexit.

@tjmcgibney @ianvisits Or of course there’s this, which came as a reply to the original. She’s making it up too? At some point you have to consider the possibility that it’s not all upside. https://t.co/bYOnOeZfHQ
@tjmcgibney @ianvisits Except you’re accusing him of making it up. It’s like accusing an accountant of fraud, a lawyer of intentionally lying, a doctor of malpractice. It’s a serious allegation. The alternative: you’re denying something because it doesn’t fit your worldview. Occam’s Razor: it’s you.
@tjmcgibney @ianvisits You have no idea who they were. Perhaps they were the logistics people. You’re casting around for ways to deny something despite having no basis for denying it. Consider the possibility you’re wrong, and they did say this.
@daunorubicin @NewYorker “Today in self-defence, we’re going to learn the ‘witty aplomb’ technique. It’s been used by American writers to great effect even when threatened with a gun.”
@tjmcgibney @ianvisits So you’re not contradicting the idea that a longstanding journalist would have overheard two people talking about a topic that he’s interested in.
@ArchieDaunt Is that the correct company listing? As I said, we can follow along and see how it goes if so.
@daunorubicin @NewYorker Given that we see all over the rest of the piece that Mallory is a completely unreliable narrator, I’ll go with “nope”.
@tjmcgibney @ianvisits Thinking that someone - especially a journalist - won’t overhear you in a public place is a category error. It always amused me when I’d call people and they’d say “how did you get this number?” It’s my job to get info.
@ArchieDaunt Andritz is an Austrian company. If the UK subsidiary is Andritz Ltd (https://t.co/fAk6sKZsuq ) then I guess we can track how well that works out. Do you know which it is?

@ashic yeah, we really do need to get to the motherlode on this.
@jgharris7 @davidgerard that’s true - one person saying “Walmart”, which doesn’t accept.
@ashic I think we can agree it would be good to see the actual survey methodology and results. As we also agree, I think, 3% feels high (even with some significant number of those saying yes just having used it to buy other coins).
@ashic That’s not how proper surveys work. Ipsos would normally seek to poll a representative sample of people, which includes those who are uninterested. It doesn’t just put up a poll on a website and pray for clicks. You’ve seen too many crap “surveys”.
@miss_s_b But, again, when we spread it in our networks - assuming that those consist of people who agree with our thinking - it doesn’t lead to people believing him. Those who believe him spread it anyway. The newspaper failed.
@miss_s_b Sure. There was a colossal failing by the Shropshire Star. But equally, he was directly challenged by LBC on air, and rather than responding he hung up.  I think propaganda is the better term. That’s what this was.

@heywoodbill @felixsalmon @bhorowitz Yup. It is surprising it’s that high. I can’t find the original survey, though.
I disagree. Without its virality I wouldn’t have found out about the mysterious £6,000 per month that he receives from a mining company, despite having no obvious expertise in that field. That seems worthy of further examination. https://t.co/byd6r5cJRX
@Codepope @felixsalmon @bhorowitz Hah or ransomware victims
@kentindell @felixsalmon @bhorowitz 27 or so of the survey. It does feel high. Perhaps 24-5 in reality and rounded up.
@ashic @felixsalmon @bhorowitz Possibly it was “I used bitcoin to buy some other cryptocoin”. But 900 is near enough robust, and Ipsos is a reputable survey company.
Five-year bets on bitcoin come home to roost. Can you guess what % of Americans answered positively to “Have you purchased anything using Bitcoin as your payment within the past month?” 1%, 3%, 11%?

@ianbetteridge “A new device category that’s exactly like the others, but from a company whose hardware sales are tiny.”
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife As I think the examples show, both can be true at the same time.
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife The article very specifically says in its headline that it’s about the paranoia that fuelled Brexit, and the article fulfils that promise, IMO. Other master narratives - about bumbling idiots thinking they know better - are available. https://t.co/iKs803O9it
@afbenn95 As an example of what FOT was describing, one doesn’t have to look far. Mark Francois MP tearing up an Airbus letter and invoking his father’s D-Day involvement. Or this amazingly incorrect claim from another MP. https://t.co/Exjm5kr8Gg
@AllianceBE What are the names of the businesses you represent, since you’re demanding rights of reply?
@rob_mcivor But they also claim to be representing a yet-unnamed set of businesses. Would be good to know more detail.
@iainmartin1 @afbenn95 @RuthDE @reactionlife Depends very much who is using it, and how. In this instance I didn’t think the aim was to slather in compliments.
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife Is he anglocentric? Don’t know. Don’t think it matters; the piece could be written by a Martian for all I care. What matters is whether it describes the situation. Seems to me it does, and well.  I noticed very little appeal to Freud. So I guess that’s no.
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife As for stylistic errors, I’m just telling you what 20 years editing stories at a national  paper suggests to me.
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife “He’s a hack who used to be a historian” isn’t what I’d call a nuanced take on the substance of his piece. Actually, it doesn’t deal with his piece at all. And doesn’t sound like praise.
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife Again with the ad hominem. Nothing you’ve said actually contradicts FOT’s argument, but quite a lot has undercut yours because you’re not engaging with the article.

@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife Tbh I think 2nd yr undergrads are more likely to use phrases like “bathetic immiseration” (and then use “bathetic” twice in a piece, reducing its impact) thinking it’s really apt, when in fact it just annoys readers.
@afbenn95 @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife I assume you mean second year undergrads who are heading for a 1st since anyone who came out of university with a prose style that precise would be snapped up at once.  I found it unambiguous and well-structured, unlike the article that responded to him.

@ir_ScottR Suuuure. That’s why so many were indicted. Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. https://t.co/wEvsosB5YV
@ir_ScottR Nonsense.
@ir_ScottR All of which were covered endlessly.
@HGHeron @iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife I don’t understand whether she’s saying that Dorries and Bridgen are examples of levelheaded well-informed people or what. Dorries is hardly regarded as a towering intellect.
@ir_ScottR @JoshMargolin @karentravers @mattgutmanABC @quinn_owen That was a single case from 2017 (or previously mentioned then). If he had described multiple cases that would have been written up. And I pointed you to an expert who looked at cases going back years.  Unlike Homan, she wasn’t trying to cover for a lie by her boss.
@ir_ScottR Remind me - how many people were indicted from Obama’s team? How many sentenced for lying to the FBI? How many cabinet members forced to resign for misusing government funds?  They actually just didn’t break the law or ethics rules. Simple as that.
@ir_ScottR @JoshMargolin @karentravers @mattgutmanABC @quinn_owen I think you’re imagining that Homan said it. He might have said they’re trying to find confirmation. He hasn’t confirmed it. That would be everywhere.
@ir_ScottR They were. However he didn’t lie hundreds of times per week. People quote one thing back at him - the pledge on doctors for the ACA. That’s it. Trump? Dozens of lies per week. Latest: that intel chiefs testimony on live TV was “fake news”.

@iainmartin1 @RuthDE @reactionlife Hmm, is @ruthde honestly going to hold up Dorries and Bridgen as her two Brains of Britain?

@costahammer Sure - pride is an emotion.
@cimota Oh come on. You need to ask?
Name them. Name those businesses so we can find out where the reason for optimism lies.   Shouldn’t be hard, since you claim to represent businesses with billions in total turnover and 50,000 employees. Name them. https://t.co/qTLGRRsk2R
@cimota Not going to disagree with you.
Yes, bit of a challenge for @AllianceBE which begins to look like a media front for some bloke who’s pro-Leave and isn’t spending enough time considering what could happen to his supply chain in the event of No Deal. https://t.co/fbbs8aHfmf
@cimota They say they were set up after Chequers - fair enough - but I don’t believe a word of this “billions in turnover/50,000 employees”. Notable how it’s the Express and Telegraph who have fallen for their claims.
@gralefrit @RebeccaFront @BBCr4today College Green will turn into a sort of favela, with correspondents living there 24/7 and desperately trying to cadge quotes from passing MPs, who will dispense wisdom as they pass like throwing coins to the starving.

@klookk @PascalLTH Pointless telling people to go with the facts; that’s what the original tweet thread I linked to explained. People decide emotionally and then rationalise it afterward. In all sorts of things.
@klookk @PascalLTH It’s misguided to say that emotions based on lies are still emotions? As the demonstration that what I say is true, I offer you all the people who believed, in their gut, that Britain would be better off by leaving. An emotional reaction built on a lie.
Evergreen tweet https://t.co/NvTH4q5uVT
@keithb_b @janeadamsgb That’s pretty low-level conflict, and the threat level is similar now to then; the difference being that lone wolves don’t plant explosives or make phone calls about where they’re going to strike. In that sense, conflict hasn’t gone away. Just transmogrified.
@keithb_b @supermathskid The Spitfires stuff is not rational, which means it’s emotional. I’m emotionally attached to peace, but like pretty much all the people discussing this here, I don’t know what war is like, so it’s a nebulous thing to say.
@SusanPickin @shootersix No.
@klookk @PascalLTH Emotions based on lies are still emotions.
@jasonguptill13 You need to pay attention to who’s tagged in tweets, then. I untagged her a while back. I doubt she’d have the time to respond. You could write to her office, I guess. It’s not actually clear what her stance is. Perhaps she’s doing fact-finding, shocking though it might sound.
@PascalLTH @PascalR57 Boil it down to a slogan and we’ll see where we go. Three, four words max.
@BrexitBlogs @thefsgirl And also untrue. But when were they ever about truth?
@PascalR57 @PascalLTH My point, perhaps expressed poorly, was what strong positive emotional narrative could be offered *before* the vote. “Take back control” is a strong positive one to leave. What’s the remain equivalent?
@jasonguptill13 My position? I’d suggest that you’d treat govt exactly as if it were an early-stage investor in the drug. It should recoup in proportion to its investment - perhaps in discounts on the drug. Sometimes you need govt to encourage investment in drugs that few need.
@thefsgirl That’s what I was trying to say, perhaps poorly, in my original tweet.
@TedMielczarek It’s one of those things that slides past when you don’t think about it.
@jasonguptill13 If you’re struggling with this, imagine you invested in Google in 1996 when they were a struggling startup in a garage. Now they’re going public. “Thanks,” they say. “Bye now.” See anything off-kilter there?
@jasonguptill13 Her: do we invest in your drug discovery at the early stage?  Him: yes.  Her: do we get anything back from that?  Him: no. She isn’t taking a position on what the government should do in that clip. But it’s abundantly clear that the government is getting a bad deal, isn’t it?
@thefsgirl The only part that might have had emotional benefit is the EU funding. If the Tories hadn’t been worried that would show up the impact of austerity.
@thefsgirl That’s nice, but it’s not a punchy slogan you can rally people around.
@ir_ScottR @JoshMargolin @karentravers @mattgutmanABC @quinn_owen I cannot find any outlet that has quoted Homan saying anything about duct tape and human trafficking victims. However here’s an expert who looked at 1,435 indictments since 2009. Number of cases: 1. Trump is making it up, as usual. https://t.co/hcfomKZkkD
@WanderingGaia ah yes. So true.
This @newyorker piece by @sbg1 starts off great and gets better, believe me. https://t.co/V5chJfBxDV https://t.co/vo96xgHPYC
@WanderingGaia The irony is that it’s MPs in both main parties who are out of favour with current leaders who are most in favour of EU. How does that work 🤔
@WanderingGaia I like Wider Horizons. (Though I bet Leave would nick it at once.)
@WanderingGaia which was a bit difficult for a Tory govt going full speed at austerity 😬. The more we discuss the more I want to kick Cameron.
@WanderingGaia sure, I agree. I’m only trying here to navigate towards what might be a powerful emotional message, ideally summed up with a few words, that expresses it.
@WanderingGaia certainly more could have been made of the EU funding in various areas, science projects, and so on: the benefits we’ve received from being part.
@lunaperla as I said previously: https://t.co/NwQxNASGKK
@WanderingGaia so, “Stronger Together”?  The problem is finding an emotional appeal in being part of a fairly inchoate group, rather than a smaller one which has been turned into folklore through films etc for decades.
@GervaseWebb @janeadamsgb Yup. They think they’re going to be Private Ryan, not the guy shot in half on Omaha Beach.
@MajorGrubert @sunny_hundal Britain didn’t/doesn’t lead Europe. The last time it held the presidency (largely titular, only six months), was 2005. https://t.co/l7f8NoA9pS
@sunny_hundal @PeterNimmo1 oh wow yes. Peter, I think you of all people should know the power of emotion over demonstrable facts!
@shootersix @SusanPickin last two lines certainly describe the Brexit referendum.
@PascalLTH people feel very strongly about the NHS. It garners an instant reaction.
@PeterNimmo1 @sunny_hundal as Sunny explained, and has been demonstrated in multiple studies in other situations, emotions are more effective than facts in these cases. We decide emotionally, and then post-rationalise when the decision is “reasonable”.
@supermathskid that’s a reasonable point. Cameron et al were completely tone deaf on this.
@request_d then again, when you watch some MPs, it’s hard not to think that they’re uneducated xenophobes at best. I’m thinking of the guy who tore up the Airbus letter on TV.
@cymrojazz @thestephmerritt @sunny_hundal it got them over the line, and in winner-takes-all one-off voting that’s enough. If there’s a 2nd ref, things could be different.
Online media is having a Wil. E. Coyote moment. https://t.co/6KItd0aZrL
@PascalLTH cite them, then. The powerful appeals to *emotion*. The ones that resonate with millions of Britons in the way that “take back control!” and “fund the NHS not the EC!” did.
@WanderingGaia what are they, though, and how do they compare to easy emotional appeals like “take back control” and “fund our NHS rather than the EC”?
@sevitz yes, exactly.
@supermathskid if persuasive emotional narratives exist which could persuade millions, I’m surprised they didn’t surface.  In 1973 there was a feeling of “be a big part of something growing bigger!” (from coverage at the time). Now, not so much.
@thestephmerritt @sunny_hundal yes - but that’s because after making a bad decision for emotional reasons, one rationalises why it was actually a good decision. We hate cognitive dissonance, or admitting we got it wrong. (Though quite a few do now think they got it wrong.)
@supermathskid I did see “EU hasn’t had any wars”. Not the sort of thing that works well on the side of a bus.
@sevitz that was why they held a peoples’ assembly ahead of the referendum to work out what the question should be, and what topics needed to be addressed first.
@supermathskid People did use the “peace” argument. It isn’t an emotional one. Or at least not as strong as an appeal to Spitfires, The Few, and so on.
@sunny_hundal I don’t know! I’m just trying to provide a frame. Others need to paint the picture.
@supermathskid No strong emotional reason *for Britons* precisely because they haven’t been invaded, perhaps.

@batched_fufi Britain has a much more complex relationship with the continent than the continent does with itself, which is odd given the history.
@ottocrat @chrissn good points. The problem is that we couldn’t explain 2.5 years ago that this was where we were going to be.
@mrbaldi no, ideals of peace etc aren’t *strong* emotions you can act on. It’s only when they’re imperilled (as now) that people are roused, and find themselves unironically fighting for peace.
@ottocrat @chrissn the emotional case now is becoming stronger, and is coalescing around “this is all turning to utter crap and didn’t need to”. Which is a sort of “change the change” election message.
@SusanPickin @shootersix you need to enunciate an emotional narrative for staying in the EU which will work for 17.5m+ Britons. Find something that resonates in the way the NHS does.
@sunny_hundal btw, if you want an example of an institution that does provoke a positive emotional response: the NHS. So it’s a q of “how do you make people feel about the EU in a way they do about the NHS?”
@jasonguptill13 Her questions point up that the govt is an early-stage investor, yet receives no benefit from that. The company reaps all the rewards, gives nothing back. Again: what did early investors in, say, Facebook or Google get in return? NB: she isn’t advocating govt take over sales.
@ottocrat @chrissn I understand your reasoning, Chris, but 700k isn’t 17.4m.  I really wish there were a pro-EU *emotion* that the general UK populace could tap in to. But it’s nothing compared to, say, the NHS. That’s the sort of emotion you’d need to find generally.
@stshank ofc. Though that’s not a subliminal literacy thing in the way that subtitles are.
@40percentmayfly that’s not a positive message to make people vote your way.
@mrbaldi that’s a negative emotion, which isn’t the way to win elections, generally. You also sounds quite violent, tbh. Maybe have a rethink.
@mrbaldi That’s not really a positive emotion to make people feel they want to stay in the EU. More like “how do you feel about this gun pointing at you?”
@swkenny @sunny_hundal I think one would take the same approach with those suggesting Trump as the stability candidate.
This is true https://t.co/siQcaJSqhz
@sunny_hundal I think that’s what your thread called for! But I’m not sure there’s a way unless and until people start feeling the pain of it.
@janeadamsgb ah yes. Almost medieval.
@sunny_hundal yes, it was a supremely clever slogan (which also didn’t promise a destination).  “Stronger Together” didn’t work too well. (Though we’d be saying completely the opposite if Remain had won so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  )
@swkenny @sunny_hundal it’s the classic election trope: change or stability? You have to find the emotional thread in “stability” to make the Remain case an emotionally attractive one.
@janeadamsgb it was across the dock from the building. But the building really shook. Weirdly (this was 1996?) I thought “oh, that’s it then. A plane has hit the building. We’re screwed.” Happily, we weren’t, though there were two dead across at the dock, I think.
@swkenny @sunny_hundal nope, I’d say it’s orthogonal.
@janeadamsgb I was *in* the Canary Wharf building that night, so I sure remember it.
@sunny_hundal a positive narrative isn’t the same as an emotional one. That was *your* point, with which I agree. “Help lead” is weak sauce compared to “take back control”. Even if that taking back is pie in the sky.
@janeadamsgb it doesn’t. The US had a civil war more recently than the UK did.
@SylviaMcCarthy yes, very true
@janeadamsgb understand the family thing. But not having a war is a bit like not having a giant hole in the roof. If you never had one, you don’t understand the attraction of not having it.
This thread is corret - it’s been shown in other situations that emotion is far more persuasive than facts or reason. The problem: there’s no strong *emotional* reason to want to stay in the EU. There really isn’t. It’s a reason thing. Appealing to WW2 emotion will trump it. https://t.co/N6NylNGbht

@Claire_Phipps @superglaze here’s what’s more weird: the people writing this stuff did not always think like this. At some point they must have learnt, or been taught, to view this as a “snub”. How does that become institutional memory, but sensible stuff doesn’t?
@FraserNelson @GoodwinMJ that’s what Insta is for grandpa
@jasonguptill13 @AOC think it through. What do early investors in a successful company or product usually get?
The BBC, like many news organisations, hasn’t navigated the difference between “impartiality” (not taking sides in a debate) and “balance” (getting different views on a topic).

@fourfoot The new English organised crime series: “The Tenors”
@jasonramasami these things are all comparative. TOS is episodes, not a big narrative, and so it’s punchy. Of its time, effects-wise, but I’d rather have good plot and bad effects than vice-versa.
@inqie Fabulous, aren’t they? A wonder. Makes you wonder how many other lost demos there are out there

@RhiannonJudithW Dark Star! Might make the trip for that one.
@_geraint Cross-reference Leave voting areas with tourist spots. I suspect that because tourism is temporary, it doesn’t influence opinion; they’re just a source of money.
@drewdraws2 The only episode I liked in S1 was the time loop one, because it was clever, well-paced, and you’re as puzzled as the participants.
@Jorarl Might make them focus on writing better stories to capture the attention rather than leaning on set dressing and CGI.
@Jorarl yeah, War and Peace - the enormously long book everyone has heard of and hardly anyone has read. (A few more have watched the TV series.)  I feel it’s a huge missed opportunity. And if it’s set 10 years *before* TOS, why not make it look like that? Go retro? More waste.
@chattychooks And the characters in TOS became clearer to us as we watched. But they were adults and not likely to change radically in their five-year mission.
@Jorarl it’s boring. She is a supremely boring character, surrounded by other boring characters. They’ve forgotten the lesson of GoT, The Sopranos and The Wire: talking isn’t doing.
@chattychooks they didn’t need character development, because the characters were already developed. Yes, it was episodic - because that was their life: noodling around from place to place, experiencing stuff, getting out of tight spots. Never watched Babylon 5.
@chattychooks I grew up on TOS. This can’t hold a candle to that.
@Jorarl it’s literally one of the worst things I’ve ever watched. I stuck it through because I watched while running on a treadmill. If TOS had been like that I guarantee it wouldn’t have inspired a generation of engineers and scientists.
@DrDavidGK yes but at least STUFF HAPPENED
@alanemtage oh. *crumples up paper*
@mschipperheyn it’s not as if ST:TOS didn’t have some American panjandrum stuff, but at least they managed to move the damn plot along. There has been literally one single good ep of ST Discovery - the time loop one. Every other one is slow and dull and pointless.
@chrisratcliff No. Is it on UK Netflix?
@alanemtage I wish I’d done the same.
@DrDavidGK What do those words tell us
@RewterP Again, you’re creating a strawman; hence this is our last conversation. What’s the real relative wealth of these groups of immigrants? I doubt you know. Since 2012 there’s been an income requirement for non-EEA immigration. I’ll let you find it and enjoy your day.
Star Trek: Discovery. Gritted my teeth through the first series. S2 E1 and I’m now thinking that each episode is 5 minutes of action packed into 60 minutes of weak character exposition, pointless asides and long silences. In comparison ST:TOS is all action, all the time.
@RewterP Except that if that is his sincere concern - that the country as a whole is seeing too many immigrants - then the concern should be around non-EU immigrants, which has always been higher, and always been in the UK’s complete control. https://t.co/o5ZFtf9VIh https://t.co/gOTYDMzDVa
@RewterP You’re the person throwing up a strawman, and it’s an odious thing to do, so don’t. I pointed out the disconnect between the actual population and the person’s view.
@JohnLamont Yes.
@n_equals_42 I don’t have the rate of change. I don’t think non-expert individuals can make a good prediction about future demographics.
@RewterP @MichaelPDeacon It’s *concern* about immigration, which - like the UKIP vote - tended to be highest in the places where it was lowest. That, and rate of change. https://t.co/X1LR7YsybE
@sloughnan @MichaelPDeacon Folk tweeting me saying that it’s rate of change of immigrant population, not absolute number, which is a determinant. Sounds like that’s true.
This is really interesting on “Brexit and public opinion”. This is actual research (rather than anecdotal vox pops) and thus worth paying attention to. https://t.co/bdm2JPU8an
@sloughnan @MichaelPDeacon So people move into those areas for work, which means there will be shops to serve them, and jobs from that. Which is bad.. why? When the alternative is that the area collapses because there’s no work and nobody doing anything?
@realachristison @MichaelPDeacon Ah well that gets us back to my tweet of the other night.. https://t.co/TPvj2PnL4U
@janeadamsgb I recall that too, which was why I looked that up.
It’s difficult to find recent demographics, but Crewe &amp; Nantwich voted 60% Leave. As far as I can find, people born outside the UK make 5% of its population. Immigrants from Continent &lt;1%.  Yet the person quoted thinks “there’s too many of them”. https://t.co/jrlbpsLtXn

@SiobhanONeill 🙄
@jamesewand agree - but Remainers probably suspect that it’s complicated and difficult; that if it were easy it would have been done already, and that its not-done state implies complexity.
@jamesewand we haven’t “outsourced our technical expertise on matters of trade”. It’s super-complex and needs attention of experts. The foolishness has been people who disregard that thinking it’s “easy to do”. It manifestly isn’t; to pretend so is irresponsible.
@jamesewand my objection is not to which position people have. It’s that valuable airtime which could be used to explain the situation is instead given to people who do not understand the situation at all. As I said: like asking someone in the street about nuclear fusion or bridgebuilding.
@jamesewand because their opinion - sought before the voting in Parliament - will not have any bearing on what happens. They aren’t steering negotiations and don’t understand the complexity. Ask them about tourism in their town, or their MP. Sure. But not complex unknowns they can’t affect.

@MarekmikaMarek I think they’re fine with those things. But negotiating country-level treaties and taking consideration of multiple supply chains is something very few people have done. About as many as have built a fusion reactor.

@MarkGallagher71 @Frances_Coppola this is what citizens’ assemblies would be really good for. Which I think was recommended for Brexit ref to advise on wording. But Cameron wouldn’t listen.
@Bi99le5 @BrexitometerC I’m fairly sure I heard lots of business leaders saying this was important, and reports of them telling govt it was important, in the past two years. They haven’t ignored it. Ministers apparently have.
@SimonWood2k5 because I expect better from the BBC.
@mattijackson @sunny_hundal they are not the most important voice that needs to be heard at this time. Expertise and experience rather than emotion and ignorance is what you need to make important decisions.
@vowe I’m very aware of that. Foolish MP on TV right now says “they’re as worried in Europe about a no deal as we are.” Oh dear.
@mattijackson @sunny_hundal they weren’t asked “are you satisfied with the complicated political deal which is being negotiated to try to exit our commitments to a customs union, single market and Good Friday Agreement?” Most peoples’ views on that aren’t important.
@solentstars @Jim_Cornelius Thank you.
@LukeJWilcox @sunny_hundal it’s remarkable how many people are revisiting that quote
@fascinatorfun @solentstars @Jim_Cornelius their job in interviews is to let people speak, in general, especially where truth (such as “trade deals are easy”) can’t be proven on the spot.
@Bi99le5 @BrexitometerC I don’t care about the word on the street. I care about what is being done with supply chains and negotiations.
@DaveLeeBBC That would be a good counterargument if we were not at a point in history where the complexity and need for knowledge and clarity is enormous. Everyday Britons don’t have valuable insight on this; and plenty of places to express that non-insight. Such as here.
@solentstars @Jim_Cornelius I disagree. BBC does a better job overall than any of them. There is no propaganda - that’s a delusion of your own bias. But vox pops are the worst possible waste of time.
@PaulGuinnessy @alexbrooks this is definitely a question
@bellum_omnium7 I would have said that but ran out of characters

@solentstars @Jim_Cornelius so where do you go for deep unbiased analysis? I like the BBC for a lot - its political journalists right now are the best. But vox pops are the worst form of journalism.
@alexbrooks @PaulGuinnessy that people are being driven mad by the utter incompetence of the government, and Parliament.
@jdubulondon @iamelliot All three have shown their ignorance out of their own mouths many times.
@neiltak yup. Maddening.
@Soya1909 doubtful
@PaulGuinnessy I think the BBC line is “until/unless a 2nd referendum is called, Brexit is where we are headed, so deal with that.” Fair enough. But they need to get to factual reporting. If it’s bad, report that.
@ballantine70 @katebevan brm-TISH

@jason_pontin hm. There is the alternative model, of Very Rich Person taking the place of (many) advertisers or (lots of) payment revenue. Patronage was popular before scale was feasible.
@moogyboobles @StigAbell I think I’m The Knee Yup
@jason_pontin Why is it that social networks and search engines (even DuckDuckGo) with their huge infrastructure costs and commoditised product can apparently sustain themselves on ad-supported models, yet news can’t? Is it simply a scale thing - network effects don’t work in media?
@macinfoirl for boring reasons there’s only one place it can physically go.
@_geraint true - which is sort of why I asked - but they might also be designed specifically to do that.
@bloggmeister but that raises question of how eero, Google etc find it worthwhile.
@bloggmeister but the Airport line was fixed. The only money they had to spend was on software compatibility with new devices and the occasional new Wi-Fi spec. Did the salary of one, maybe two people exceed profit from those? Or maybe they just didn’t sell - people don’t need extras?
@bloggmeister I’m just looking at the product page!
@bloggmeister possibly - I doubt the failure rate was high. They just seem to regard it as a market not worth investing in, which I honestly find puzzling.
@bloggmeister can they act as Ethernet routers too?
@bloggmeister (I’ve found the Express to be reliable - the Extreme less so.)
@bloggmeister which one do you suggest?
@gibbzer it was a fitting occasion for a wonderful guy. Love to all xx
@vmarks thanks, Victor.
@vmarks thanks, will try.
@simon_earle The bits that get hot ought to be at the bottom (so that in normal circs the heat goes out the top, but the metal at the bottom doesn’t interfere with signal coming out of the top). So upside-down should just let heat dissipate from base.
@blakamin So underfloor? Once you get to more than one floor then one underfloor is another’s ceiling..

@JesalTV Sadly eero isn’t licensed for the UK..
@jopkins Was that a home setup? What products did you buy?
@jopkins @marxculture Interesting. Got a couple of AExs which seem to be failing, or at least not showing up in Utility though they do pump out the wifi.
@stevehomeruk No no no got to be same SSID or it’s too much jumping between things. So are you in Cornwall now or back in Hawaii?
Answer seems to be “yes”. Bonus: tips from a former Apple Wi-Fi engineer on how to do better Wi-Fi. https://t.co/5KHNGKfkPm https://t.co/pZDpJubnk2
@dpfrank07 @PenLlawen I’ll tell them “Douglas said it would be fine” and have a sort of amazed disappointed look on my face.
@stevehomeruk Turns out you get very weird interference effects - as in, the whole intranet goes down - if you have two AEs with the same SSID too close. Guess who knows this directly.
@marxculture I mentioned the Apple Airport Express for a reason.
@jopkins @marxculture It’s a possibility. Thanks.
@PenLlawen @dpfrank07 But it couldn’t make it *worse* to put it with the top side facing down into the room, right?
@dpfrank07 Hmm, Airport Extreme is omni (they think) but less clear about the Express. Some pictures here of a disassembled one. https://t.co/FfEMYNyPM6
@dpfrank07 Ta
@marxculture Already answered. So you think WAPs distribute their signal equally below and above their base?
If I’m installing a Wireless Access Point (WAP) in the ceiling - say, an Airport Express - would it make sense to put it upside down? Is its spread of the Wi-Fi signal stronger from the “top”, so downwards in this scenario? I feel like the answer is “yes”, but..?

@andrewchen fair enough to talk about decades. But I think it’s more likely you’d have automated individual kitchens than shared ones. Shared kitchens haven’t been a thing for, what, centuries in the west? Why should that change?
@andrewchen a million shared kitchens in university digs say nope. There’s always going to be incentive to defect (on washing up, etc). And the rewards for defecting are too big.
@andrewchen ooh no. Communal kitchens are disaster areas, in so many ways. Who cleans up? Who made the mess? Who’s using the thing? Where’s the pan gone? Who left this on? The hassle is endless. Your thread kinda sorta made sense, up to here.

@jamesgoffin time limit makes it harder to negotiate a good FTA. It might seem like it would be an advantage for UK, but EU could stall, and UK then gets what is in effect no deal, plus needs to set up border. UK loses out far worse from No Deal. Far, far, worse.
@mattbirchler is it a “set variable” thing? When you return to Shortcuts, you just tell it to set the variable from the result coming out of Drafts?
@jamesgoffin but if the UK could unilaterally leave the backstop, it would do so on day 1, thus making the negotiation pointless. Of course the EU wouldn’t agree to that. The UK is bound by the GFA.  Interesting point about the border. I think it would fall under “security”.
@jamesgoffin Follow the logic. GFA is in effect a treaty with Ireland, which UK is not repealing. GFA means must not have hard border. Thus UK must satisfy EU that its measures are sufficient to act as a non-physical border, else it is breaking the GFA. It’s political and practical.

@pilhofer @dankennedy_nu I’d say @simonw would have useful input here. Think his name is on plenty of MPs expenses stories. (If not, should be.)
Exactly. What none of these Brexiters seem to grasp is that the backstop is an in-case measure. Figure out a borderless check, as has been posited, and you’re good to go.  Weird how they insist tech can do it, so backstop isn’t needed, then that backstop is evil. https://t.co/EkjV5OmWtW

@jaykannan when you say things like that, it’s obvious you’re just talking nonsense with no basis. I don’t want those conversations.
@jaykannan The notch. So unpopular that by May last year there were FIFTEEN phones from Huawei, Asus, Huawei again, Oppo and Vivo using a notch. I wonder why they thought it was a good idea. Number’s even bigger now, of course. “Unpopular”. Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. https://t.co/ZIjEvyhjlN
@clairlemon @guardian @jason_a_w what an amazing misrepresentation of his piece. Thus neatly illustrating what his piece aimed to point out: partisan reframing of what happened.
@jaykannan Yes, it’s a mix of both. But what mixture? You don’t know, and nor do I. This is pointless.
@jaykannan you need to answer if Apple’s sales drop in China means people gave up Apple phones to buy other Android, or put off upgrading and kept existing ones. Given the whole market contracted, I’d guess the latter. Sure, Huawei sells cheaper phones. That’s popular. Profitably? 🤷‍♂️
@jaykannan I don’t think you’ll find Huawei has higher brand equity than Apple. The quality thing one can argue about. But vast majority of their sales will be from/to other Android users defecting from those brands.

@BadToss @BeingKimmie acknowledged. Have a good day.
@BadToss @BeingKimmie that nobody seems to want to hear that Serena would not blame her loss on her ankle, even if her loss was due to her ankle.  Many onlookers say “it was her ankle! Why not say so?” A: because that’s not how it’s done.
This is quite the thread. Crowdsourcing suggests that quite a few of these companies are wayyy less impressive than they make out. Such as the one with net recorded assets of £8 (not a misprint). https://t.co/AOCyGWVZJ4

If you’re saying “experience and knowledge doesn’t matter to explain what someone said, how I feel it should be matters more” - that’s a bad road to travel.

@BadToss @BeingKimmie OK, so “I’ll put you down as a maybe” is British ironic: it’s the response when someone has absolutely, completely, comprehensively rejected your idea. My only point has been: pros don’t blame their losses on injuries. They see it as disrespectful to opponents. Not “fans/media”.
@christwattering I think the claims about “civil unrest” are overplayed from a 2nd ref. It becomes a balance: dramatic economic harm from No Deal (because it weakens negotiating position, plus GDP impact), or some political harm? Neither is good. Which is why ERG needs to shift as it has votes.
@christwattering I don’t think they’re trying to *rescind* the 2016 ref. Some may be saying it’s worth asking people quite what they actually want - as the article points out, “Leave” had no destination, and we have multiple different ones on offer. Which is it to be precisely?
Translated, it reads “Warning: may contain trolling” https://t.co/ShB6NLQeIi
@christwattering The Remainers aren’t trying to plunge us into No Deal or saying that it’s a better option than the WA. They want some option less than No Deal. Rees-Mogg literally said yesterday he couldn’t support the WA unless backstop is removed. It’s fantasy.
@christwattering Note however - since you fixated on it - that it’s the ERG which has the votes to get the WA passed. They’re the party-within-a-party which is deadlocking the process.
You have to stay for the snippet-after-the-podcast for @glgerstle’s neat idea on the non-political method that would get Trump to end the shutdown unilaterally this weekend. Always excellent; always worth an hour of your time. https://t.co/QLVYNPbt0B
@jaykannan 1) China’s economy and its smartphone market are both contracting. Lots of evidence confirms. 2) Apple chooses not to sell at as many price points as Huawei. 3) Samsung is still the top player. It sells phones at all prices. So do all the others. Huawei’s advantage isn’t “value”.
@christwattering @FraserNelson @edvaizey I was going to suggest that he print it out and show it to every MP, but that seemed like too much work. Certainly - it’s got lessons for everyone, and spares nobody. Justifiably.
@maxrogo In the second case it might not be jaw jaw.
This is a terrific piece by Britain’s former EU ambassador, veteran of negotiations. “We shall [after Brexit], like an outsized Switzerland, be negotiating on everything… for as long as both UK and EU exist.” Clear-eyed, astringent, required reading. https://t.co/I16jaLbN22 https://t.co/mfdaJCqiOK
@FraserNelson @edvaizey Perhaps Ed could print this out and get the ERG to read it. Uncomfortable truths, but truths nonetheless.
@sexisix3 The core of this is: did her ankle affect her? Almost certainly. Is she going to blame her loss on it? No, because pros (and champions) don’t do that. It’s a tacit part of being a pro. Everyone has some injury, big or small. You play on, or you concede. Nothing more.

@BadToss @BeingKimmie Right back at the beginning of this I pointed out that in years of going to tennis match pressers, I rarely saw a player blame their loss on an injury. That’s extra true for champions. That’s all the context here. That’s why I think she didn’t blame her ankle for her loss.
@gchaslot Did you see this thread? I wondered what would happen if one tried watching those videos - whether one would be pointed to/recommended the same ones from an anonymous account. https://t.co/oe8JjIPt1I
@sexisix3 don’t say “the foot fault should never have been called”. That’s just naive. If it’s a foot fault, it gets called. Else it’s like saying “well, it was an ace, who cares it was out?”
@sexisix3 I didn’t say the ankle didn’t affect her. I said that in general, players don’t blame their losses on their injuries. Especially true for champions. I’ve watched the highlights. Tough match all through.
@chrisdrakeuk I actually linked to that in my daily email newsletter last year - it’s from 2015, I think. But sure, nothing dramatic has emerged.
@BadToss @BeingKimmie fair enough - point us to a better analysis.
@BadToss @BeingKimmie “I’ll put you down as a maybe”
@WaltFrench @adampayne26 ask Donald Trump?
@chrisdrakeuk will have a look. May be a little early to have a clear idea though - some of those might only emerge after long use.
@BeingKimmie understandable, Kimberly. Have a good one.
@chrisdrakeuk interesting - thanks.
@BeingKimmie @BadToss no, I’m asking what your experience is, because I don’t know. My point is that that opinion piece is by someone who was there, and has seen her many, many, many times before, and was at the presser. At some point it’s worth listening to someone with a lot more experience - him.
@BeingKimmie @BadToss he was there, and at the US Open, and in the pressers at both, and he’s been covering tennis a long time. How about you?
@BeingKimmie @BadToss are there cameras on those lines? It’s not like Hawkeye. Or the let cord, or service line. You could have it, but it would be mostly wasted. Foot faults are incredibly rare.  Avg 18 games in a woman’s match, avg 6pts per game, 70% 1st sv = 140 serves. Typically zero ft fault.
@BeingKimmie @BadToss ok - like I said, I didn’t see the match, and only heard early reports.  Foot faults - timing suggests it’s tension. The judges watch that line every point. They’re not picking a time. Else she’d never win a match.  This is a useful analysis (he was there) https://t.co/8IaHur87UF
@BeingKimmie @BadToss Again, I say this having attended hundreds of pressers, won and lost.
@BeingKimmie @BadToss The foot fault is just unfortunate. But she keeps getting dinged for it. They’re real, evidently.  Players don’t blame injuries because that takes away from the opponent’s win. Inside the profession, it’s seen as snide. You’d only do it if you hated someone (which does happen).
@BeingKimmie @BadToss I didn’t see it so don’t know if the ankle was a factor. But getting to three more match points (so she won three points at least in a game) suggests she could move a bit.  Players tend not to comment on their or opponent’s injuries unless it obviously compromised them.
Those sunlit uplands seem to be a desert https://t.co/kkq3SO6xac
@BeingKimmie @BadToss What do you think she wanted to say here? Was her ankle yoinked? I only heard reports of the match.  Note: I spent years going to player pressers so I’m familiar with that milieu.

@chrisdrakeuk I think smokers who haven’t switched to vaping have been let down by information. But govt isn’t going to say “switch to this less harmful thing”, ie switch from smoking to vaping. It will say “don’t do harmful things”, ie don’t smoke *or* vape.
@chrisdrakeuk what part of these regulations comprises “undue restriction”? https://t.co/UOEzqGuwp6 (specifically looking at the e-cig part). All seems pretty obviously desirable to me. E-cigs *reduce* health risks. They are still raised (oral, throat cancers) v not using at all.

@GolebiewskiGreg It means you’re relying on the work of millions of others, and that to continue to reap the benefits of that and reduce the corrosive effects of drastic inequality, you need redistribution. It’s a fantasy to think that huge earnings are due to the sole efforts of a single person.

@joetrev You think the UK’s objection to labelling was reasonable?
@joetrev Fair enough. It still feels as though you’ve gone off on a lengthy grumble about an isolated part of an overarching thread which was illustrating a totally different topic.
@joetrev Why don’t you tell him, then?
@Harkaway What’s in a name? CRISPR is one of those technologies whose implications make gunpowder look unambitious.
@joetrev So is your assertion that he has misunderstood the purpose of the labelling?
@thegrugq Hey, I’m just quoting the caption from one of the pics in the thread from the Daily Mail, which is where I get all my information about SAS sidearms. They never just sit in an office and make it up, you know.
@joetrev Hang on. There were concerns (even if subsequently shown to be unfounded): https://t.co/nzOTPpTmYu  Labelling means people can make informed choices about what they buy. Eg “contains nuts” labelling. The science was not totally settled in 1996. That took until the 2000s.
@thegrugq Listen, even SAS folk have to have holidays. And, you know, just happen to pack their kit. “Oh that? It’s my self-loading Glock.”
@arhomberg @mattgemmell “I’m voting for a DIFFERENT status quo”
@mattgemmell “I’m going to vote for the NEXT status quo.”
🤔 https://t.co/3zFYYTX6wL
@joetrev I don’t read it that way. I read it as: the EU said “we should label this” (remember: 1996) and the UK said “why bother?” But of course it became UK law, because that’s how it works.
@CandiceC_W Ooh. Hotel. Is this a Queenie promo thing??
@Harkaway Isn’t that a bit like saying “on its own, gunpowder is pretty uncontroversial”?
@JamesLiamCook @larakiara I’m sure the new Wing Commander of X-Force, @edvaizey, would be happy to send one over
@joetrev Also: the EU labelling is about aspartame *and other sweeteners* - read it here  https://t.co/gop5rIi3SS and at the time (1996) the science wasn’t settled. I think you’re blowing this off too lightly, and seeing it from today’s perspective rather than the time of the regulations.

@joetrev It reassures consumers who think there’s a difference. The attempts at public education at the end of the 1990s failed: people simply wouldn’t believe DNA couldn’t be evil.
What’s also notable in this thread is how many of the 72 are disagreements about the EU budget and/or funding for programmes. Post 2006, it’s pretty much all of them. In other words, those “EU laws” aren’t “laws” at all, but budgets. https://t.co/oR1YrIOMfy

@GolebiewskiGreg more true than the dolt suggesting the parents taking $7 of $10 were the same as a 70% marginal rate on more than $10m.
I haven’t seen Top Gun in absolutely YEARS. The planes are fuelled by cheese, right?

@Mackadoo9 @edbott I’d suggest you stop putting off that psychiatric evaluation.
@GolebiewskiGreg I’ve seen plenty of Republicans suggesting that the 70% rate would apply to all levels of income. See AOC’s tweets for an example where an ex-GOP governor suggested just that. I’ve also seen someone from American Tax Reform? (Or similar) say that.
@edbott Ah. I’d been conflating things.
@GolebiewskiGreg Fine - so the US has got the structure correct. Which means it should be easy to tweak so that Medicare for all becomes straightforward. Create a government monopsony for healthcare, citizens pay that rather than insurers. Win-win.

@GolebiewskiGreg @jimmy_wales @Black_Kettle Whether something’s funny depends a lot on the audience. Maybe to his followers?
Predictable Stage 2 of Liam Fox’s failure to achieve what he claimed would be easy and nobody else thought he could achieve: blame. It’s like a modified Kübler-Ross. Impossibility, failure, blame, redefinition (of the bad/unacceptable as good), claimed triumph. See also: TMay https://t.co/AlpoYUKyPZ
@jimmy_wales @Black_Kettle I wasn’t suggesting he was looking for trouble. Though if you take a bunch of male teens to a pro-life march with Ben Shapiro talking, spirits might get high. Would one put on that hat, in that crowd, ironically? I don’t think so.  It’s overblown. But also indicative.
@jimmy_wales @Black_Kettle Expand?
@Black_Kettle For sure. Be fun to compare it to one of his English essays. But he’s probably had sufficient 15 minutes’ hate.
@Black_Kettle Sure. I don’t think he put anything like the amount of thought into what he was doing as has gone into that letter, which doesn’t need a semantic parser to figure out had input from a ton of people (unsurprisingly).
@Black_Kettle Because nobody puts one of those on by accident; it’s a statement. If you’re the sort of person who puts on a hat like that in public, it becomes harder to take your claims of “just standing here, no harm no foul” as sincere.
This would be fine… except for the MAGA hat. Where’s his explanation for how he happened to be wearing that? https://t.co/W0wra4tMhn

@GolebiewskiGreg can’t read it - I’ve used up my article limit, apparently. OECD stats or some other open data source (https://t.co/0k9n6Lq15a) would be fine.
@GolebiewskiGreg you’re really going to have to demonstrate the US’s having “one of the most progressive” systems. With links and diagrams.
@GolebiewskiGreg except we’re talking about millions and a few hundred. I saw the cartoon you posted. Humans aren’t wolves.  “Medicare for all” - shifting the money given to private insurers to the govt to create a monopsony for drugs/health care - would be a good use for the surplus.
@GolebiewskiGreg you mean, you don’t think there are marginal rates for the SS and payroll  taxes? I don’t know.   If the US got VAT, it would be quite the revolution. Trump was considering it, I believe.
@GolebiewskiGreg my point is that a 70% marginal tax on very high earners can be justified, and that flat taxes are noxious.
@GolebiewskiGreg individuals aren’t going to be good at determining which roads need work, or where to build a new sewer. That’s why I called government a redistribution mechanism. It’s meant to allocate spending to the wider benefit of society.
@GolebiewskiGreg no. 30% on personal income - that’s progressive. 23% social security - that’s linked to income. 10% payroll - that’s related to income. So that’s 63% from progressive taxes by my reading.
@benedictevans I like this idea a lot.
@GolebiewskiGreg by the way, two things to consider. The internet came from US government research. Linux, the OS which (in some form) powers pretty much all the web servers, IoT, every smartphone - was written by a Swede who did it as a sideline of his very, very extended university course.

@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 I think you’ll find Dublin was happy to take the cash. Can’t recall for Lisbon. Anyway, you’ve offered no concrete example(s) of how Maastricht was bad, despite at least four requests, so I’ll say goodnight.
@GolebiewskiGreg yes, I know. That’s why it makes sense that the few who benefit exceptionally from the social fabric provided by those many should maybe contribute as they can.
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 UK austerity was driven by the government’s wish to reduce its debt load, which had been increased by buying shares in crippled banks so the banking system wouldn’t collapse. Were you not awake in 2010?
@GolebiewskiGreg you mean that most govt tax receipts in Sweden comes from VAT, corporation and capital gains tax?  Wrong.  53% from personal tax and social security taxes.  Read also: https://t.co/dI7B1o5wcT https://t.co/fOGwNz5ZmS https://t.co/A23vlh0n77
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 UK austerity and regional disparities were the acts of the UK government, not EC measures. (Not in the euro, remember.) Euroscepticism is a result of austerity, regional disparities, and, often, low-level racism. None down to the EU.
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 When you say “EU austerity” do you mean the aftermath of the 2008 crash? The EU didn’t implement an “austerity” measure - that’s for individual governments.  A reminder: Britain had austerity despite not being in the euro or Schengen.
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 but I notice from your other tweets that you’re light on facts when it comes to the WTO and EU, so I guess the kneejerk reaction and lack of factual examples shouldn’t surprise me. But give it one more go. Concrete example where UK’s signing of Maastricht damaged economy. Go on.
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 those effects would have happened whether we signed up for Maastricht or not because the EU would still have implemented them. Maastricht was not going to end FOM because FOM is in the Treaty of Rome. EU austerity would have happened regardless. You haven’t provided an example.
@GolebiewskiGreg try again? It comes up OK for me. Screenshot. https://t.co/F4cNfgPK3C
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 please give concrete examples of how the UK has been disadvantaged. We aren’t in the euro or Schengen. Freedom of movement is in the original Rome Treaty, predating Maastricht by decades, so was always going to be part of this.
@GolebiewskiGreg it is relative to others. Taxation levels are all about relative amounts. That’s why a flat tax is immoral: it is cruel to those on low incomes.
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 We were already in the EU, via Margaret Thatcher and others. Please offer concrete examples of how Maastricht was a disaster.
@GolebiewskiGreg If you’re finding it tricky, here you go. “US income distribution graph” https://t.co/YzS2rWSQiL https://t.co/OQ9uEPkIUW  *really* left-slanted.
@GolebiewskiGreg yes. I asked for income distribution. See if you can find a graph of that so you see who you’re weeping on behalf of.
@GolebiewskiGreg nobody is saying that. The message is: it takes a lot of people to generate that money, and you rely on all of them being part of a cohesive society, so it’s a good idea to give back to them via the redistributive mechanism of the government.
@SteamerHarrold @iainmartin1 please details the way in which Maastricht was a disaster for the UK. Concrete examples please.
@GolebiewskiGreg this is such a weak argument. The $100k household has ~$91k in disposable income left. The $10m earner has $6.4m. Who is worse off again in this strange world of yours?
@GolebiewskiGreg now draw the income graph for all Americans, and show us how many you’re weeping for while those on the median income struggle with any unexpected health care costs.
@GolebiewskiGreg the star’s income comes from the efforts of huge numbers of people - scenery makers, film crew, power station workers, road layers, bus and train drivers (bring audience to show), the audience themselves. The money isn’t generated from thin air.
@GolebiewskiGreg $15bn is more than zero, though you’re right that Americans need to view tax as a way to improve their country.
@GolebiewskiGreg Telling people they must earn more is easily done. I think they already know that. But taxing them at the same rate as high earners is regressive because they must spend proportionately more of their income on basics.
@GolebiewskiGreg The purpose isn’t to cap wealth. It allows people to be and become wealthy. It’s to bring up the rest of the society on which that wealth depends. No point being the only rich person if everyone else is destitute.
@GolebiewskiGreg So the star would be left with $17m. Penury. Meanwhile the government would be able to build roads, defend the nation, even offer healthcare so that people would be well enough to come and see the film. Virtuous circle. Also, the number of such high earners would be miniscule.
@GolebiewskiGreg But if you have a 20% tax and then 70% above say $5m, the $100k family now has $80k and then $10m person has $4m + (5x.3) = $5.5m.  Not perfect illustration because total tax take may be lower. The $10m earner couldn’t earn that w/o wider society so should pay back in proportion.
@GolebiewskiGreg It’s an economic one which describes the effect of reducing money available for purchasing non-essential goods and services. If everyone is taxed at 40%, those earning $100k have $60k for heating, clothes, food etc. Those earning $10m have $6m. It’s hard to spend that much.

@Alanling8 I would regard it as cosmic justice if the resultant disruption causes you personal discomfort. Karma demands no less.
@Alanling8 You’re racist. Own it.
@Alanling8 The world is unbelievably more complex than it was when we joined the EU. Look at what’s happening with medicines: the supply chains are already strained, and we’re months away. If insulin is held up, people will die. Because of a foolish neo-imperial nonsense.
@Alanling8 No. What a stupid, stupid question. The EU is asking us to stay. Liam Fox’s inability to draft trade deals isn’t because the EU has held him back. It’s because he’s completely unequal to the task, and underestimated its complexity - in common with all Brexit advocates.
@Alanling8 And I have to say - you are the worst possible advert for Brexit advocacy. The casual racism and hate in your bio and your tweets confirm all that people worry about from those who think Brexit is “easy” and “necessary”.
@Alanling8 It is not a tax. If you’re stopped by the police for driving too fast, what do you call the money that you then have to pay the court?
@Alanling8 I don’t know how many times I have to say that it has only been applied in extreme situations, which means that it isn’t a tax. And there are women and children in the boats. Read any coverage of Mediterranean rescues.
@gruber @benthompson Fair enough. Is a good episode.
@screedful @ntaylor963 I think there’s a stage during the off-ground phase when they bring legs together.

@stuartd Er… ok?
@GolebiewskiGreg Such altruism. Just do the calculations and realise how tiny the impact on take-home earnings are for someone who takes home $10.5m per year. It’s tiny.
@Alanling8 It isn’t a tax. Again, did you read the Guardian piece? No sign it has been levied against U.K.   in a crisis, you’d all go.
@kellyfincham @jayrosen_nyu It’s a reasonable principle.
@estellecostanza @hugorifkind @SamWhiteTky 😂😂
@Alanling8 did you read the story I provided, which is actually after that came in? The fine is only applied in extreme cases. If you think refugees tend to be young men.. they’re more healthy and productive.  The west didn’t create the Syria crisis. That’s entirely internally generated.
@brianstelter @oliverdarcy this is the worst possible take. I think @oliverdarcy’s time would have been much better spent trying either to confirm or tear down the story itself. You know that thing about not shooting the messenger? About playing the ball, not the man? Do that.
@Alanling8 the UK has taken a tiny number of refugees, but we also see a tiny number of those seeking refuge. There are more British homeless people - by a factor of about 100 - than refugees. The Channel boat stuff was typical: tiny numbers leading to misdirection from real problems.
@Alanling8 consider the stamina it takes to travel thousands of miles with nothing. No water. No food. No money. A family leaves together. But how well would you expect women and children to survive that? Or might they stop earlier and take refuge? That’s why they try to reunite.
@Alanling8 you would write to your MEP and your MP and the relevant minister. The “fine” was only imposed in extreme cases. They’re not “so-called refugees”. They’re people fleeing murder and destruction and persecution. Your comfort has blinded you to suffering.  https://t.co/dPZAxk9byM
@Alanling8 and, again: if you aren’t advocating proportional representation, you’ll see nothing change. Consider whether Liam Fox or David Davis will get thrown out for their multiple lies about how easy Brexit would be.
@Alanling8 @mrjamesob @fotoole the UK exercises its veto, and QMV gives us more veto power than you’d expect.  you need to distinguish between “regulations” (needed to align with single market) and “laws” (national things, generally). We’ll have to fit with EU regs to trade there. So, regulations remains.
@Alanling8 @mrjamesob @fotoole jeesus, this one again? From the government’s white paper in February 2017. You’ve had two years to absorb this fact. We participate in making the laws, and we have succeeded in making the laws that we want. UK ministers take part in making the EU laws.  https://t.co/QZOdKF05Aw
@bmwelby @transportgovuk it was the link you gave!
@Alanling8 if you were advocating a shift to Single Transferable Vote, that would be something. But FPTP isn’t going to change things.
@Alanling8 @mrjamesob @fotoole please explain where the accountability is going to come from. In what way is it any different from what has gone before? Will Liam Fox and David Davis be thrown out by voters for their stupid lies?  We make our own laws. EU stuff is, in general, just regulations for trade.

@GolebiewskiGreg re 70% marginal tax on over $10m income: the top 0.1% in 2017 earned $2.7m or above.  Take a guess on how many would be above $10m. 0.01%?  US median household income: $59,000.   This seems to leave a lot of headroom for the $10m marginal tax bracket. https://t.co/KtIOWn0vjt
@GolebiewskiGreg @maxkeiser could you disambiguate that, Greg? Are you actually dumping your shares? Or just offering a “translation” of the tweet you’re replying to?

@subwus @KarenStopHate @PeteNorth303 no, I think it’s a (subconscious) mode of thinking. Haven’t you read his articles about the Falklands etc?   EFTA is OK if you *insist* on being outside the EU, except it wd leave us accepting rules with no say in which ones. Second-best to remaining.
@Black_Kettle it is amazing. I’m astonished he’s still driving.
@subwus @KarenStopHate @PeteNorth303 It does no such thing. Anyone who believes that is subscribing to the imperialist notion; that the UK alone is more than enough. In the modern world, that isn’t true.
@upine @jayrosen_nyu if you haven’t already, the New Yorker piece on how The Apprentice massaged Trump’s image is well worth a read.
@upine @jayrosen_nyu as the saying goes - I paraphrase a bit - “even the poorest American thinks of themselves as a temporarily embarrassed millionaire”
@subwus @KarenStopHate @fotoole @PeteNorth303 I disagree that it’s necessary in any way whatsoever. Austerity? Not EU’s fault. Immigration? Largely not EU’s fault. Regional disparity in investment? The EU tried to rebalance that.
@Black_Kettle wellll.. he could have died, which could have seriously affected our ability to negotiate free trade deals. Or not. He does seem to have been amazingly lucky, tho’. That was nearly a royal funeral.
@neilcybart @benthompson @gruber Sure, but the China-US trade war noise has been going on for a while. Ben has pointed to the inversion of the release dates of the X last year and the XS/Max and XR this as also contributing.  Huawei thing *might* have prompted more “nationalistic” buying.

@SemperTyrannis Correctly rebuffed by the Labour party (rebels).
@jaykannan Everything has a price ceiling. A far better explanation for this miss is a combination of Chinese recession/slowdown and China being uninterested in “S” models. Remember, China accounted for “more than 100%” of revenue drop (to quote Cook) so ROW grew. https://t.co/s0kIZBM74A
@bjorn Which is regrettable.
@benthompson Surely “Cook doesn’t seem like a head-in-the-sand, I’m-sure-everything-will-be-fine optimist” is the exact opposite of what @gruber said on the Talk Show you just did?! (Always enjoy those editions.)  On Huawei - yeah, it’s 100%. https://t.co/owf6jAKD44

@SemperTyrannis I like your optimism about STV but the problem is it’s not in either big party’s interest to support it. Maybe a few more hung Parliaments will sort it.
@SemperTyrannis The “particular issue” is almost always the Human Rights Act, and it’s Tories who claim it handcuffs them, usually untruthfully (Theresa May a particular offender). Treating people as having innate rights should not be a source of outrage.
@gassee As I say, it’s a complete mystery to me why US papers don’t actually go after the monsters.
@theog__ @mrauchs @clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian Better to build out the grid so that energy can be delivered it to people who need it for actually valuable things like light, heat and useful production.
@SemperTyrannis Yup. But Cameron screwed it just as he screwed the 2016 ref. What a track record that guy has.
@mrauchs @clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian Is the utility demonstrably greater than consuming as much energy as various countries? The opportunity cost alone suggests the answer will be no forever.
@NickyWoolf “Watch your…back”

@NeilW_NI @jeffvandermeer The ending of the film was so, so brilliant. Garland excels at that - same with Ex Machina. The books go way beyond, of course.
It puzzles me that US media can’t identify him as the truly evil actor in all of this. Trump is a fool, but McConnell knows exactly what he is up to. https://t.co/YMNbAHQ9kj
@SemperTyrannis If our political system is broken why do you want Parliament to have any control at all? I’d favour a proportional representation system but that’s another referendum that Cameron screwed up, though to his advantage.
@SemperTyrannis You’re not making a lot of sense, to be honest.
@moorehn There should be a thing called “both sides disease” which only afflicts US journalists
@SemperTyrannis @fotoole Hm, perhaps you could explain why UKIP politicians want to work in an organisation they want nothing to do with. Ruin it with their expense claims? Nothing you’ve said contradicts the article. The Tories cling to outdated ideas of Britain’s place in the world.

This NYT piece, about the shambles of the British exit from empire, is a worthwhile companion to the @fotoole piece I linked to earlier.

@internetthought Racism takes such subtle forms, doesn’t it. The setting of expectations; the erasure from everyday media. One might say “oh, Hallmark knows its audience” (old white passive racists?). But times change.
I’m two-thirds of the way through @jeffvandermeer’s Area X trilogy (Annihilation - which was made into an Alex Garland-directed film; Authority; Acceptance). The film is fantastic, in both senses. The books even better. The truth about Area X always glimpsed, never seen.
@ianbetteridge So I guess one could just replace “Guardian” with “news org”.
@internetthought That says they have four *in starring roles* but doesn’t make clear whether they’re the love interest. Big difference.
@internetthought Seems to confirm that? No interracial couples on Hallmark there.

@clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian We have better uses for clean energy and bitcoin tends towards dirty energy that is continual rather than green which is discontinuous.  We need to move to clean energy. We don’t need bitcoin to “make” that happen. That’s exactly backwards.
@dcanellis @clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian …on the public blockchain
@jimbomorrison Ooh lovely
@clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian yes, money laundering is a problem. That’s not a reason to make it worse.  But bitcoin’s key problem for finance is inefficiency. Amazingly slow, consumes excessive energy.
@rjphowarth @JRubinBlogger it really does turn on what “publicly held” means, as you say. It seems pretty narrowly distinguished here in the GSAIG report. https://t.co/5t032md0aO
@clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian as utilities go, the fact that that happens outside KYC/AML restrictions means that it encourages kleptocracies and money laundering. That’s not really a positive utility.
@leylandrichard it was. Thanks Richard.
@clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian I didn’t say that.
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian come back in two years and we’ll see how it’s going. Nice talking.
@htsfhickey you think someone head-faked Dow Jones?
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian How’s that store-of-value thing been going over the past 18 months?
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian and think through the energy implications of every bank running blockchain.
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian no, it wouldn’t.  Imagine all X bitcoin is mined. It can buy Y goods. Avg goods cost = X/Y A year later, natural production growth means there are Y + Z goods. But X bitcoins. Avg goods cost = X/(Y+Z), ie less. Why buy now, when tomorrow goods will cost less? Deflationary spiral.
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian Bitcoin is not going to replace the banking system. If the banking system ran bitcoin for billions of people, the energy demands (because hash rate because blockchain verification) would be unsustainable.
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian nonsense. It doesn’t encourage or discourage financial responsibility. It’s a niche pursuit for people who cleave to disproven libertarian ideas about finance, or hope to get rich quick.  It cannot underpin a financial system because of its inherently deflationary structure.
@clayfromdabay @mdudas @guardian why is that a good thing? That’s the action of money launderers, kleptocrats, and criminals. Nobody doing honest work needs to do that.
@jimbobbles @mdudas @guardian the banking system provides very significantly more utility, and bitcoin’s constraints (monetary and transactional) mean it can never replace the banking system.
@SimonCampb3ll @mdudas @guardian For bitcoin? I don’t think it can shift to POS - that would be the fork to end all forks. The article is specifically about bitcoin, not blockchain(s).
One for @jayrosen_nyu: what happens when you tell voters that Trump isn’t self-made and was in fact born into a wealthy family? And why didn’t they know that already? https://t.co/yhJ69YDlYF https://t.co/qySmdwCjIf
@mdudas @guardian What specific utility does bitcoin (not the generality of crypto, or blockchain) bring that isn’t available elsewhere at lower consumption?
@mdudas @guardian Why? What is wrong with it? I read it and felt that the perspective made sense. Wasting energy on something which brings minimal utility - or contributes to climate change (note the coal sourcing) - isn’t a good move. What’s your complaint here?
@kentindell A tendril of it.
Second time in as many weeks that the US Dept of Homeland Security press office has been shown to be lying. Previously claimed TSA agents weren’t pulling sick days. In fact they were, and are.  Sayonara credibility. https://t.co/l7wijsEPHM
@realdanlyons @RudyGiuliani Quite possibly. He’s also setting up things nobody suggested they did - hack the DNC. Could also have said they didn’t steal a Picasso, set fire to grandma’s house, or pay off a Playboy model. NO WAITAMINUTE
@prjx @JRubinBlogger The “officer” question is crucial, by my reading at least. He stands to benefit as a shareholder in Trump Org, yes - but the rule seems written so elected officials can be shareholders in companies which get govt leases. If you own Megacorp shares, and it owns all the property…
@JRubinBlogger Hmm I’m no fan of Trump at all, but the lease’s second sentence “shall not be construed as extending to any person who may be a shareholder or other beneficial owner” surely means if he isn’t an officer of Trump Org, it’s OK. If he was still an officer/director of Trump Org, no.
@dmerfeld @msthebaron @marcoarment Except.. it’s very rare for newspaper/magazine redesign to boost copies sold. (That may be due to external factors, of course.) They also tend to revamp contents. But it’s really hard to say it has ever driven *sales*. Love to know examples where a redesign increases recognition.
@alexhern @fst0pped Even the ones set up by fakers where I get the congratulatory “so glad you joined!” email? I never know what to do with those. Occasionally I go and change the password if it seems to actually be used for something.
@alexhern @fst0pped Ah, that I don’t know. Sorry, thought your meant your email login for your email was in HIBP. If you have unique passwords, it’s not a worry as long as 2FA is on for the key ones, I think.
@alexhern @fst0pped Yes: if you turn it on, it doesn’t matter that they have your email and password.
@dmerfeld @msthebaron @marcoarment I don’t think I can remember a newspaper design unveiling (we always got an early one) where everyone went “FINALLY!” It was always “why’s there all this white space? How many words does this lose per page compared to the old design?” Then years later the old designs look *grey*.
@alexhern @fst0pped Or (d) turn on 2FA for that email and others 😬
@dmerfeld @msthebaron @marcoarment Oh, interesting: I was vaguely aware of the Dropbox thing, but didn’t think it so big. (Print) newspaper redesigns were a sort of constant revolution in my experience. As soon as it became too familiar, it was time to scrap it again. And that’s far bigger than just a logo.
@DocRobotnik I can see the logic. If you spent all day riding you’d become so attuned you’d probably get a feel for it. Even so, amaaaaazing.
@ntaylor963 Ahah. But also logic suggests that the small dogs must bring their legs together while in mid-air. Otherwise how do they get power for the next stride? Back pair stride and come forward/front pair reach forward and pull/all in air/back legs come forward for next stride/
@dmerfeld @msthebaron @marcoarment So you reckon in a week everyone will have forgotten about this? It may be like newspaper redesigns (which I have a lot of experience of) - people complain like crazy on day 1 and 2. By day 10, as long as the crossword is in the same place, they can’t even remember old design.
@dmerfeld @msthebaron @marcoarment There was indeed some grumbling, but nothing comparable to this; and I understand why.
Somewhere God is laughing up a cosmic sleeve. The GFA which bans a hard border, Northern Ireland which voted to Remain, represented by a bunch of people who want to Leave with a hard border. https://t.co/Z5SHqrQXVf
@ntaylor963 Yet the galloping mechanism should be common to both. Unless small dogs use a different galloping sequence (I’m pretty sure our big dog uses a horse-style galloping sequence).
@dmerfeld @msthebaron @marcoarment “People worked really hard to..” isn’t a legitimate justification for anything. People can work really hard and produce crap, or brilliance. Contrast the Dropbox logo update with this one. I seriously don’t get why Slack didn’t go for modest evolution to cement its branding.
@davidfrum What’s your over/under on the timing?
@moorehn OTOH, that sort of stuff is *really* remote. It’s multiple generations away. Whereas partition of Ireland.. (and departure from India… ) And yet there are Brexiters completely uninterested in effect on Ireland of “no deal”.
@zzbar “Siri, find me the animal that has hooves. No, wait, hoofs, dammit!”
@brianweeden The Redfinch guy? Perhaps they could confront him with documentary evidence. We don’t know because it’s not written as a play-by-play. He feels he was stiffed, so nothing to lose. Hell, he might even get the rest of the money, right?
@moorehn It’s pretty easily overlooked when you live in the midst of it.
@brianweeden By “someone” you mean the Redfinch guy? Perhaps the WSJ finally tracked him down.

@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui the gov can’t really do it. It can only put in place policies that will do that.  Depends what you mean by “wealth”. Dodgy Russian money? Money stolen from Africa by kleptocrats? One needs to be more specific.

@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui yes, it is useful. Economic choices are political choices, and vice-versa.
@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui which circles back to my point about how successive governments have failed to invest in regions. If they’d done that, businesses would do that too. HS2 v regional airports v fibre internet everywhere v “let’s build a railway in London”.
@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui except to whom does the capital accrue? If it’s used to purchase foreign goods then it’s swallowed in that trade. Otherwise it just accrues and you have China’s position, where it buys US T-bills just to have something to do with its dollar surplus.
@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui I don’t think it’s deemed “preferential” to have a deficit. It’s just unimportant, generally, compared to other measures.
@MoralesMeoqui @JamesJWYork but Venezuela’s problems have been caused by its gigantic trade deficit, surely. Compounded by its government’s willingness to print money.  Not saying that trade deficits are always so dramatic, but in extremis they’re a problem. https://t.co/0WwMhLRS5s

@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui You said that the UK suffers economic harm by being in the UK. Please explain what you think that harm is.
@JamesJWYork @MoralesMeoqui The phrase “free trade” assumes compliance with agreed regulations on both sides to minimise inspection and/or quotas. Are you trying to suggest it just means a free-for-all where both sides lob things at one another in the hope they’ll buy it?

@bikerrebel1 @mattwarman You don’t just say “leave”. You specify the options. Perhaps you have a Single Transferable Vote system - if not May deal, then option 2 No deal. Etc.
@JamesJWYork The euro created a homogenised currency base, which is logically going to create a base where lowest cost producers (*within EU regs*) are going to win. It’s unsurprising we can’t compete with that trading bloc. Not that the euro is good in all respects - I don’t want it.
@JamesJWYork Jeez, do you understand economics even slightly? Do you know why productivity growth matters? Why regional disparities create inequality and social frustration? What comparative advantage is, and why economists don’t fret so much about trade gaps now?
@JamesJWYork Could you explain to me how the UK’s slow productivity growth is the EU’s fault? Or its regional disparities?  The regulations are necessary to create a single market we can export into, and receive goods from, without them poisoning/etc us. Did you even read that Fullfact piece?
It would be even more, but Australia has big import tariffs on cars, food and other products. Which is why the EU began negotiating a trade deal last May. Bet the EU has a FTA with Australia before a Brexited UK. https://t.co/358VY3VCEh https://t.co/rqeIwDIbwa
@JamesJWYork Once again: if you think the trade gap is the problem, the cause doesn’t lie outside the UK. It’s in inadequate investment in regions by past govts, and weak UK productivity growth. EU has provided regional grants and training programmes. We haven’t improved.

@JamesJWYork You and Jeremy Corbyn, both wanting to leave the EU because it stops government making bad decisions about investment? (Not that it does. See govt pouring money into carmakers in mid-2000s trying to save jobs.)  The problem isn’t the EU. It’s UK productivity.
@ianbetteridge @AndrewOrlowski Yes, Andrew - if I’d been interviewing you on this, your response of “it’s out there somewhere, you find it” would have struck me as distinctly fishy after your certainty of what you thought that MFN exclusion document shows. Where’s its parent page? The context?
@JamesJWYork Trade stats tend not to be useful KPIs; they haven’t been for a long time. We don’t even grow all our own food, and haven’t done for a long time, so for a start that will be negative. So will many other things. And leaving the EU won’t improve that figure. Quite the opposite.
@JamesJWYork We’re in competition with everyone, but it would make sense if we didn’t shoot ourselves in the foot because we’re angry with our shoes. Austerity was a key problem, over-reliance on financial services another. Neither of those the EU’s fault.
@JamesJWYork Chronic lack of investment in regions has been a long-term problem, but that’s due to Westminster, not the EU. Acquisition of UK businesses by outside corps: isn’t that the much-fetishised “inward investment” in many cases? And often it’s US buyers, not EU.
@JamesJWYork We don’t suffer economic harm from being in the EU; the contrast with being outside it shows that. The economic harm has come from austerity and overconcentration on financial services in London. Democratic harm - we have more devolution of power locally than for centuries.

Interesting to see a senior Tory (chair of the Conservative Policy Forum) suggest they abandon the 2017 Conservative Party manifesto pledge to leave the SM and CU.  It’s a sensible suggestion, but points to how splintered the Tories (just like Labour) now are. https://t.co/zsmRHyJpWt
@AndrewOrlowski @ianbetteridge I’d have thought that such a thing would be documented, and that it might even have merited a filing on https://t.co/fsmQINYsJh given that it’s formal and important.
@AndrewOrlowski @ianbetteridge Here’s a former WTO negotiator (Uruguay, Doha) on how well it works, or not https://t.co/Od0dH5LGrR https://t.co/UmcMxOmrtx
@request_d Already happens through the ECB, surely.
@request_d I think it’s hard to find the dots to connect that line.
@ianbetteridge @AndrewOrlowski I can’t find a formal report of the UK applying to the WTO to give MFN status to the EU 27. Can you, Andrew?
@WhatTheBit @benthompson @counternotions I was thinking of @tabdump just the other day. Do you miss doing it ever?
@JamesJWYork I dislike the politicians who take extreme views and insist on them in the face of all the evidence that implementing those views would harm the country. I dislike those who are hypocrites.
@request_d Economic union (or alignment) is vaguely justifiable - if you’re going to be a single trading bloc, it helps to have a single currency - though I bet the US dollar had some fun times in its first 20 years too. Modern stress might be too much for the euro, tho.
@counternotions That’s definitely a play taken from the same management book that includes “the beatings will continue until morale improves”
@benthompson @counternotions Jiminy. How many tabs *do* you have open? I probably have 20 in the main window, and ~40 more in minimised windows.
@AndrewOrlowski @kentindell That last para is full of joy and light, isn’t it?
@feraldata @stuartmiles @3AInstitute Probably says that we miss being able to play vinyl backwards
@benthompson @counternotions *cough*1Blocker*cough
@counternotions First the magnetic pole and now tab customer service? Can’t even get an unwanted patdown from a TSA agent any more.
@request_d Ah, now when we’re talking about the euro that’s a whole different kettle of crap.
@benthompson @counternotions Google really ought to have shares in DRAM factories, given what Chrome has done for them. (I’m still using a 2012 MBP but Safari handles it fine for me.)
@JamesJWYork I think you’ll find a ton of them who were burbling about “empire 2.0” (just search on it). There’s also a sense among some politicians that other countries ought to be *grateful* to the UK for offering to trade with them. Business people are quick to say: not like that at all.
@request_d They’re also heavily reliant on the ECB because their banks are so screwed because their government is so messed up
@StephenFollows “It’s an ambitious move from this director, who has shot the entire film with a blindfold over the lens.”  OK Birdbox question why not go out at night so you can’t see anything
@counternotions I know, it’s like a prime minister holding back a “meaningful vote” for a month for no particular reason. Shameful. Have I ever complained about tab management problems? Would I complain to the tab manager, or is there tab customer service, or a tab helpline?
@AndrewOrlowski Those are MFN exemptions. I don’t see that actually showing that the UK can trade with EU countries on MFN basis.
I linked to this in @theoverspill on Monday (having had it in a tab for about a month). It’s very well worth reading for its terrific insight into the animus behind so many Brexiters. https://t.co/8gjzovTEQ4

@JohnLamont Whereas we now have uninformed dissent
@StephenFollows “How about, and just spitballing here guys, but.. Birdman v Iron Man? In a box?”
@StephenFollows I’m hoping it’s not “let’s make Bird Box 2 for Christmas 2019 and get Iron Man in it!”
OK so that sorts it out for Naproxen.. https://t.co/8KLdWMXrJn
@JohnLamont I’d love to know the timeline on how that played out, though in those cases it was over - from memory - the Maastricht deal, rather than actually leaving.
I was in a pharmacy the other day, and the discussion behind the counter was: “oh, the supplier hasn’t delivered. That’s strange. This one and also it was naproxilim [I think] the other day. Do you think” - a sort of dawning light - “it’s something to do with Brexit?” https://t.co/b09WEtldGN
@timsefton It’s an imperialist dogwhistle, sure.
@JamesJWYork It’s the idea that it’s intolerable for Britain to be an equal member of a group of nations making laws that will apply to all. That’s what’s imperialist. “Rule-taker” and “vassal state” give you the clues to how they see the relationship. “Empire 2.0”: https://t.co/qMtXtGOcRw
@pgchamberlin @jinglanW That’s lovely. As you say, Ulam must have had ideas to spare.
@iainmartin1 The imperialism element is the idea that it’s intolerable for Britain to be one among equals of a group of nations making laws that apply to all of them.
@request_d They do - they’re disputing with the EU what measure of deficit there should be.
@AndrewOrlowski If we go to No Deal, that means WTO rules, which means you have to apply tariffs on the WTO schedule for everyone, or nobody. The “nobody” option would undercut British sources disastrously.
@shuggieperry @anneapplebaum Online polls were generally right about referendum. https://t.co/wuBceHdsNH for the 2017 election, they didn’t see the Labour surge coming. https://t.co/Vnc2Y9KWkW But that was a three- or four-way. This is simpler.
When people like Steve Baker of the ERG say that “we want to take back control, we want to be a sovereign country”, I wonder if he thinks that Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the other EU nations think they aren’t in charge of themselves? It’s imperialist nonsense.
@AndrewOrlowski I think I’ll go with the full-time economist married to the former industrial correspondent where they’re both familiar with supply chains. *Disruption* is the problem. Exports are the long-term problem, but tariffs would have to be applied *at import*, which means delay.
@shuggieperry @anneapplebaum The polls were correct about Clinton; the distribution of votes wasn’t even - 80,000 in three states swung the electoral college. Re Leave/Remain, they were very close in the final days. And there’s always error. They were within margin of error, I believe.
Useful background thread. The guy who made a killing betting against the US subprime housing market was on Today, essentially saying: emotion makes you think bad things won’t happen. But they can and do. TMay is driving us toward a calamitous exit. Don’t let her do that. https://t.co/2PI7lunSxT

@antoniogm that’s bad form. “Wrote in Wired” would be the sensible, honest, straightforward form. Possible that a sub-editor or editor interfered with writer’s original so it didn’t seem like a lift/rewrite.

@cheungstephanie some professions do - aeronautics, medicine.
@fjeronimo @Microsoft weird that they’re less comfortable off than on!
@wilcol true.
@AndyKilpatrick7 @gorskon he’s a real person who is irredeemably dim and consistently wrong.
@shootersix this is an interesting example of publicly admitting being wrong https://t.co/MiCjvjxi1j and think there are similar in the US eg over marijuana.
@wilcol 👍
@tpigden yes, athletes have to be honest with themselves. (Contra: Jose Mourinho, who couldn’t be honest about his own failings even with himself. Though he’s not an athlete.)
An example of a politician saying in public they were wrong on something. https://t.co/Zq3Oxn2Hnu
@wilcol one is good! And it’s a good one.
@tpigden @nick_clegg I wonder if it’s that the policy was unpopular. Politicians who have moved in favour of eg gay marriage or marijuana legalisation don’t seem to lose.
@shootersix hmm, I don’t know.
@tpigden @nick_clegg yes, very interested by this topic.
@smarmit but it’s about publicly stated positions. You say it in public, you need to retract it in public.
@efairhurst Aha.
@efairhurst Hmm interesting. I have BA and KLM and AA. Perhaps it is an airline app. You’re on iOS 12?
@tpigden @nick_clegg He said he was sorry, not that he was wrong?
@smarmit @TulsiGabbard But has she said she was wrong to hold those positions?
@NeilW_NI which means he’s wrong. But over a course of years? If you stood up and said “here’s why it’s wrong, so I’ve changed my position”?
@ram_fan93059 @matthewstoller but that’s not him saying he was wrong. He was misleading.
@VlanciPictures @matthewstoller got an example?
@efairhurst in iOS, swipe right to get Spotlight screen (ie on L of home screen). Type AF655 in the search bar. No?

@_geraint ah, that might then make it a contender.

@OrgasmAndTea yes, I’m wondering too about how parents teach children about what to do when wrong - both when parents are wrong, and when the children are wrong.
@_geraint yeah but Copland has been the longer wait
@DrabkinRon That’s interesting - but did situations arise where someone would stand up in front of a room (any size) and say “I was wrong - that thing I told you? Wrong. Because X, Y and Z. So here’s what we’re going to do..” I’m very interested by cultures that encourage this, and effects.

@JohnRentoul She voted against implementing the Welsh referendum result in Parliament when it had already been carried out.
@fjeronimo @Microsoft How about comfort? I find some over-ear headphones get wearying to wear after a few hours.
@Suw Yes, though it is done well.
@zJoriz In science it’s when you have been shown to be wrong but don’t admit it that you get into trouble.
@zJoriz But it’s a cultural thing. If a scientist says they were wrong, or their theory was wrong, they aren’t thrown out. They just go on. I’m really fascinated by this.
@zkiraly Yup
@paulwebster She said there’s never been a referendum that wasn’t honoured by Parliament. Ignoring that she campaigned against Welsh result in 2005 and voted against it.
@Suw I do think this is a factor.
@shanerichmond @bt_uk @VodafoneUK Why did you switch?
@JohnRentoul She voted against it.
@BethRigby She herself voted against implementing the Welsh referendum. Tories campaigned in 2005 against it.  Breathtaking hypocrisy.
@JuliusFlywheel Yes, exactly. The focus on never being wrong puts people into dead ends.

@HamishHouston Was it real?
It occurs to me that our societies are really bad at admitting error. We find it very hard to say “I was wrong”.   Why is that? It’s implicitly embedded in science. But nothing else.   Why do we hate to say we are wrong? What would change if we found it easy to say?

@HumphreyGrizzle @shootersix I didn’t say that it’s behind all the Leave vote. But there’s tons of evidence - hate crime rise, shouts on the street - that that was a key factor. You’re also ignoring the bigger point I made: blaming the EU for things that bug people but aren’t caused by it, or membership.
Evergreen tweet https://t.co/lwy8gR5H8j
@shootersix @HumphreyGrizzle the disagreements will, but the root causes are different. Not all of the problems that made people vote for Brexit are due to the EU. (Complaints about “immigrants” are often about non-EU ones.)  But the referendum was a magnifying glass that put them together and sparked a fire
@HumphreyGrizzle @shootersix or you could argue that we live in a representative democracy, and that it’s up to the elected representatives to make and implement law. The demos is not in charge; it picks those who will be. We return to the ballot box often. This split seems a suitable time to do it.
@bob_burrough fascinating. Thank you for this. Interested to see what’s next.

@teroterotero Think of the dumbest GOP senator? Davis is like our version of that. He had the job of negotiating Brexit for two years. Failed spectacularly after claiming previously it would be a doddle. Nothing he says is worth taking seriously.
@brianweeden No, it should say that support for building a wall has increased substantially among Republicans, but fallen among everyone else. That’s the logic of the rise in their support and the smaller rise in wall support.

@Maphew Never saw BG remake.
@Black_Kettle *stern voice* it had better! I mean, more clever eps like the timeloop one would be welcome. That had the spirit of TOS but also good (better?) writing. Sometimes you want it a little more Dark Star than Star Wars.
@somospostpc I realise it’s an unpopular opinion.

@somospostpc I found TNG unwatchable. It’s like the Alien series: if you love the original, you hate the followup.
My thoughts on Star Trek:Discovery S1, though you didn’t ask for them: the only episode that delighted me was the time-loop one, because it was tightly written and clever. All the others.. blah. Ponderous and too much Klingon. Though “make the Empire great again” made me laugh.
Awwwwwww https://t.co/1uEAPVIfsR
@Black_Kettle Validation from who, though?

@seanschraeder No, I did say current literature. I know Obama promised it and didn’t deliver. Why didn’t the Republicans fund Trump’s wall when they controlled all three arms of gov in the previous two years?  You’re keen on people finding their own answers. You find that one and enjoy the day.
@seanschraeder Obama wasn’t running in the midterms.
@seanschraeder Ah, “liberal” as a desperate effort to insult. And still no links! I guess this web stuff is confusing, eh. I can’t find any Democrats who ran in the midterms on a pledge to close Guantanamo. Can you?
@seanschraeder “You look it up” is always the response of people who know they’re wrong or can’t prove something, in my experience.
@seanschraeder You mean the healthcare thing? That the US ought to join the rest of the developed world, and have a sensible healthcare system instead of bankrupting thousands of people? Pretty simple. Presently you give $32trn to health companies. Let gov buy cheaper health care instead.
@seanschraeder Haven’t seen any of that on official Democrat output, but please direct me to it if that exists.
@seanschraeder What does “you just pay for it” mean in your tweet? https://t.co/eQ65LCaRUg
@seanschraeder You demand a wall be built, but can’t answer why the Republicans didn’t fund a wall when they were in control these past two years. Trump was making exactly the same noises as now in 2017.  Why didn’t they fund it?
@seanschraeder Answer the question: why didn’t the Republicans pass a budget to fund wall building in the past two years, when they controlled all three arms?
@seanschraeder Quantitative Easing is a Federal Reserve decision; that’s an independent body. The GOP controlled Congress from 2010. They could have gone after the banks. If the banks are so bad, why didn’t they?
@seanschraeder Nope, she’s done extended interviews and comes across way better than Trump. She speaks in sentences. Coherent ones. Not burbling about walls and wheels. You didn’t answer why the GOP didn’t “fund the wall” when it controlled all three arms in the past two years. Why was that?
@seanschraeder Aw, jealous of her dance skills. It’s sweet.
@seanschraeder You mean, apart from the Affordable Care Act and the bank bailout that stopped the US economy collapsing?
@seanschraeder And just a reminder for you: the GOP-controlled Senate was perfectly happy with no wall funding until Trump threw a tantrum after he was scolded by Ann Coulter and others on Fox. https://t.co/SYNUwY5sjA https://t.co/fq76xyrjQO
@nickg_uk @azeem Slight correction - convolutional, not convoluted.
@seanschraeder She worked on the Sanders campaign, and she campaigned door-to-door in the Bronx to win her primary against a seasoned politician who was far, far better funded than her. She has on-the-ground political experience. She’s also far better in interviews.
@seanschraeder Yes, and that wall is built and paid for. Democrats now happy to fund border *security*. A wall is stupid. As I said: why didn’t the Republicans force through that money in 2017 or 2018, when Trump was making the same threats? https://t.co/2WO69yt35j
@nickg_uk @azeem Convoluted neural network
@seanschraeder As to “pay for it” - why didn’t the GOP just vote it through when they controlled all three branches in the past two years? Answer: because Republicans don’t think a wall is a good use of money. There’s a lot more to come on the AOC front. Stay tuned.

@tculpan @ShiraOvide Of course, Samsung used its marketing spend to hold HTC’s head under the water.  And Apple’s plans for this year’s phones would have been set two years ago - Sept 2017? They’d have known the broad shape of the coming smartphone slowdown, but not the particulars.
Fascinating points about @AOC and political discourse from @rickperlstein in the New Yorker. What if the other side says you’re a radical (and hence implicitly dangerous)? Think about how *you* would answer that, then read: https://t.co/3V3zhsss1I https://t.co/TWnRqaPtte
@tculpan @ShiraOvide Compare it to Samsung’s catalogue, which is bewildering, and there’s always another phone out in a couple of weeks if you don’t like this one. And Samsung’s sales are down heftily yoy.  One could just about make an argument for six-monthly introductions. But it’s not strong.
@shahidkamal @ewanpearson Very odd indeed
This is a good thread (with lots of good points, eg Japan exports from UK are just 1.7% of total exports, so raising them by 15% is not big news; and we don’t trade on WTO terms with the US - we have mini-deals in place)… https://t.co/UFKVoqSSNn

@JohnLamont The current challenge is a gigantic one - Brexit is nearly impossible to deliver well - but from May downwards those in power are the worst for ages. Labour, meanwhile, is in the grip of a fever that shows no sign of abating.

@SCOUSEeric @jamesrbuk Since the two main parties have leaders who are both trying to push Brexit, while roughly half the country doesn’t want that, it wouldn’t be very unifying.

@HistoryThat It’s the old “people vote for stability v change” thing. The weirdness of the electoral college meant the minority won and got change. Now they’re discovering how bad it is.
@vowe That is a good question. Deal as it stands is dead (can’t be enough Brexiter defections). Govt has 3 days to come back with its suggestion after that. I guess we’ll see. No deal is made difficult by amendment passed last week. It’s political zugzwang.
@HistoryThat I think there’s some implication that they meant it that way. The resemblances are too enormous.
Amazingly, it's real. "Be careful, son, I can sue you." https://t.co/MnE8x6CYL5
@SCOUSEeric Note I said “accelerated” in my tweet.
The numbers still seem to favour a second referendum by a substantial margin.  In that sense, rather like the death penalty: the wild-eyed demand for death penalty, like Brexit, among the general public isn’t mirrored by most MPs, because they can see it’s a bad and cruel idea. https://t.co/dWXxAEhd2j

@pekeler Wellll… you could argue that’s what the 2-in-1 market is trying to do. (Remember the ultrabook thing Intel tried to make happen about a decade ago?) Problem is that it’s difficult within context of PCs. Arguably Chromebooks are a sort of Tesla, but low-end disruptors.

@cwarzel Wow. That’s cool.
@request_d @ColinCorbynista Pleasure. Drive safely.
@request_d @ColinCorbynista I think there was desire for him to do more. But Trump is about different stuff, I think: in particular, immigration, wages, and a vague sense by old white guys that they don’t like what’s happening. Same as Brexit.
@PenLlawen “You’re tied to a bomb with a digital timer which, if it ticks over from December 31 1999 to Jan 1 2000, will blow up. How confident do you feel that Y2K was made up now?”
@schwa Yeah, there is that, and the fact that it’s 19 years away. How many devices will still be working? Dunno. Though I bet it’s non-zero.
@request_d @ColinCorbynista The status quo in anything is maintained by vested interests. In physics, we call it inertia. It’s a natural state of the universe.
@katebevan Although, as I wrote the tweet, I did think “how many of those systems will still be working 19 years from now?” Though the answer is probably “a few more than you expect, which is too many”
@request_d @ColinCorbynista I think austerity - which wasn’t necessary, and was justified with absurd arguments - was the thing that really did it for people. I’m not sure Trump was about banks. Obama got elected twice - first time directly after the bank crash.
@request_d @ColinCorbynista The risk weighting thing is a nice idea. The tricky thing is that you’re then reaching pretty deep into how banks work (and particularly into how merchant rather than retail banks work). Question then is, why do it? A nationalised bank is the Bank of England. Already exists.
@request_d @ColinCorbynista The banks were in effect nationalised through the recapitalisation, except it was arm’s-length ownership where the govt was a very hands-off owner. (Maybe EU rules involved.) The criminal prosecutions - for what, though? Lending money on financial instruments? It’s their job.
@clonezone @reneritchie That’s a tight data plan. Interesting tradeoff between the cost of the data plan and the cost of the extra memory in the phone.
The Year 2038 problem is likely to be a complete and utter doozy. Unix system clocks which encode the seconds since Jan 1 1970 as 32-bit integers will hit overflow. That’s bad. Like Y2K, except for (by then) gazillions of devices. https://t.co/5Zvis3wg15 https://t.co/2xxdTm1Ftm https://t.co/UTyaw7UBsp
@request_d @ColinCorbynista A sort of private-sector Keynesianism. What’s your suggestion for the 2008 bank crisis?
@clonezone @reneritchie Why do you store your music on your phone? Streaming is pretty cheap (iTunes Match is low annual cost compared to Apple Music, for example). And do you really want to listen to *everything*? Is it a professional use?
@request_d @ColinCorbynista How would you have recapitalised the banks? Bear in mind it has to be a heart transplant while running at normal speed. Agree on QE - but it’s pretty standard Keynesianism, though without the job creation.
@PaulSweeney All it needs is for people to be electrocuted in Rome and hey hey hey let’s go digging!
@PaulSweeney By me yesterday: https://t.co/yoxfq4ROi2
@request_d @ColinCorbynista You do realise that the banking system would have collapsed without the bailout? That means no money in the system. Would have made No Deal look like the best Christmas ever. QE was a necessary response. Austerity, however, wasn’t. She would be a useful leader now.
@CasPiancey @TetherTrying @BennettTomlin The definite understanding I had was that attempts to redeem would start this week.

@towerofturtles Corbynistas are quite often difficult to discern from spoofs. But it seems real enough.

@TetherTrying @Bitfinexed @CasPiancey Hello we’re in the week of the 7th. What’s happening?
@meteorradiation Benjamin Button
@tomfgoodwin What does change things is symmetric speeds. If your upload is as fast as your download (even on 3G), *then* interesting things - Periscope, FB Live, IG TV - happen. The real many-to-many, the broadcast from anywhere, life from everywhere.
@tomfgoodwin the dialup/broadband difference seems to me more like the GPRS+EDGE/3G difference than any successive one. On broadband when you get 10MB after 2MB, it’s amazing. When 10 goes to 100, it’s actually just great.  Maybe it’s a logarithmic thing.
How old is Trump, remind me? https://t.co/R5JoIFKNnS
@tomfgoodwin hm. Instagram is definitely a 3G thing (launched 2010). Mobile commerce was helped by 4G. But apps/services which *only* make sense if you have 4G? Are we certain we’ve seen those yet?
@tomfgoodwin I half agree. Faster speeds do mean  adjusting to “this could be a huge file, a streamed video, many things simultaneously.” But equally: 4G isn’t pervasive.. 8 years in? 3G is often the fallback; or Wifi, which isn’t always fast. I’ve lived with not-quite fast a long time.
@stucun oh yes had forgotten the Chipping Norton thing. He’s round there too.  I wonder if Remain could have done better if they’d made him more prominent. He actually could have carried a lot of weight, I suspect.
@Ara314413 @ThatEricAlper the careful string arrangement points to it.

@johncardillo @jearle @RVAwonk you are wrong. She’s as right-wing as ever. It’s just that to the American right-wing she *looks* left-wing because you have no idea how ideologically extreme you are compared to the rest of the world.
@WGimenes bah, there’s loads of people in the House of Representatives. They wouldn’t notice for a week or two. Imagine AOC across the despatch box from TMay tho
@film_girl This is a good thing I was not aware of, and that is a delight!
@brianweeden I’m not assuming either. But there’s no such crime as “possible collusion”. You collude, or you don’t. You collect “pretty strong evidence” of collusion, or you don’t. “Pretty strong evidence of murder” doesn’t assume guilt. It just points to what crime is being tried.
@macinteractive well, you can hope. She doesn’t look like she’s going to wait for anything.
@brianweeden that sentence was going so well until it fell into the water by offering “possible”.  If it’s pretty strong evidence of collusion, say that. “Pretty strong evidence of possible collusion” isn’t anything.

@Max404s I was wrong - it’s my 43rd year of computers. First year, I wrote a Basic computer game for my classmates. COBOL, Pascal, FORTRAN, Lisp, long gap, AppleScript, HTML, PHP, MySQL, Python.
@Max404s I’ve got a laptop. But it’s quite heavy in comparison to the iPad Pro, and I can type just as fast on the latter.  Thanks for mansplaining what equipment I should use, though. It’s only my 41st year of using computers, so I guess the advice is timely.
oh wow and now THIS thread. https://t.co/Si2uYruDdx
@Max404s so when you said “typing on an iPad is good for tweeting and that’s about it” you weren’t including typing to write books, or write other content generally. Just your typing in particular.

@robsilveruk I didn’t do a degree in journalism or law. But in maths and science and engineering I had to show my working so others could check it. It’s much the same if you’re going to accuse the EU of “wanting Northern Ireland as the price of Brexit”. If this is new to you.. hm.
@robsilveruk Ok. To meet the usual standards of journalism (and, more familiarly?, Wikipedia) it should be possible to directly cite something said in public, or said to the writer, or that a very trusted (if anonymous) source said it. With the web, citing is easier. That piece was a mess.
@robsilveruk Are you being ironic? It’s not about how the news business works. It’s about how building a logical argument works. You present facts and build on them. It would hardly be shocking if the EU negotiators are seeking the best deal for the EU. Quite the opposite.
@MuddMaurice All student debts? Or all debts of every description?
@robsilveruk The piece is full of tendentious, unproven, undocumented “well maybe it was him - OR PERHAPS HIM” assertions. If it was presented to me as an editor seeking a persuasive piece I’d throw it back. It wouldn’t pass muster on Wikipedia because it’d be covered in “citation?” comments.
@jaykannan That article’s from pre-iOS 12, and you said it runs “fine” on your X. Perhaps on a fast network it does, but I’m not on a fast network. Test for all users, not the ones in the office.
@MarkDiStef C4 publishing early would have revealed the source, yes? The fact that one of the sources also took legal action indicates that. “Scoop” isn’t really the word when everyone has the same story/material - see Gdn/others working on Wikileaks cables, or Panama Papers.

@MuddMaurice So what are you saying?
@jaykannan I did read up. And I tried that pokedex page. I’ve been sceptical about PWAs for a decade or so. (It’s why iOS and Android have apps, after all.) Perhaps this is going to be the sea change, but it seems like swapping a good experience for a so-so one, with no benefit to the user.
@MuddMaurice So you think particular debts should be laid on children - specifically they should pay for the past education of those who are now adults - but not current ones such as the healthcare, roads, and other services that adults and children benefit from?
@jaykannan Doesn’t run on my first-gen iPad Pro. (Perhaps it walks. I gave up.) There goes your “write once run anywhere”.
@MuddMaurice Until you realise that the government deficit and mounting debt is actually tax to be paid by the next generation(s).
@jaykannan If it runs in a browser, it isn’t native - however close it might seem. The browser by definition is always in the way. The other problem is it won’t look like a native app - won’t have the UI controls from the app design kit. People notice that stuff, and dislike it.
@MuddMaurice You mean the current system encourages universities to offer meaningless courses so they can collect fees, but where the graduates have little chance of paying back? I’d agree with that.
@jaykannan It’s been possible to pin a web app (ie link to a URL) to the iOS screen since forever too. PWAs rely on browsers, though, and so forever doomed to run as emulated rather than native code. Thus slower and not native UI. Yeah I’m really getting that native app feel from Pokedex 🙄 https://t.co/2hsfrVCk2r

@UmbertoBagg In the country. Satellite broadband is a ripoff - the prices are high and so is the latency, so it’s useless for actually using the internet interactively.  We’re in the country, and promised a fibre buildout this quarter. I’m not holding my breath.
@UmbertoBagg Don’t need streaming video for that, generally.
@UmbertoBagg That’s nice, but my broadband uses hand-delivered bits.
@jasonramasami Yes. Though I’m not sure quite what the something is.
@savoirsarthe I would agree, but Stanley Tucci is giving it his finest delirium.
For want of anything better I’m watching The Core, but have just realised it is Fantastic Voyage but the Earth’s core plays the body.
@JonWinstanley That’s over the course of many months of course. (Also it’s in my fitness workout playlist.)
@b33god Haha
@b33god You say that as if it were unusual for me to come up with an interesting hypothesis!
Ah, or there aren’t any drones, and never were. https://t.co/6U3gq9pIeC
OK now I very slightly begin to think this is some sort of ransom situation where authorities aren’t saying it’s a ransom situation, for understandable reasons. “Pay me [in bitcoin?] or I’ll put up a drone.” https://t.co/p8XRQMyvsR
@WillardFoxton Such cute packaging too. Is it a combat knife?
Favourite song title in 2018, though it’s not a new one: I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer. (By the ever-wonderful Cardigans.)
Took less than a minute on a 1st-gen iPad Pro. Get this @viticci Shortcut (it just runs, and you’ll get a glimpse of the power of Shortcuts - scripting for iOS). Yup, I loved the new Arctic Monkeys Album.  Other repeated one: Negro Swan by Blood Orange. https://t.co/xAdkzUogHe https://t.co/P4vPkUkKLH
@WaltFrench @edbott Hmm except The Verge says “memory shipments are said to have declined due to unforeseen inventory adjustments from Samsung’s data center customers”, quoting Samsung. So, eh. https://t.co/T1ZV1LSbA0
“Avengers, Assemble… this Ikea smart sofa.” https://t.co/5qGK0EUmno
@WaltFrench @edbott Apple is (or used to be) the biggest external customer, but Samsung itself is likely to be the biggest consumer of its products.
@IlariLehti @caro_milanesi @asymco Logic says the screen must be plastic, so what’s the viewing quality like?  Still interested to know how it will cope with a Finnish/Canadian winter, and multiple refolding/unfolding over time. I’m sure they’ve tested it, but plan/enemy/survival and so on.
@WDM213 @relequestual @MazMHussain Corollary of your argument is that the US should cut its social safety net to the lowest in the world, and ditto for blue-collar factory pay. Else someone will undercut you! Not sure that’s really what you want, but it’s the implication of what you’re saying.
@bennyj80 @asymco @BenBajarin I’m surprised they ever bought from carriers!
@SeekingN0rth Sure. Though you might want to tell Android OEMs about that.
"Exclusive: New documents link Huawei to suspected front companies in Iran, Syria – Reuters". Aka "cutout" companies to evade sanctions. Wonder if any of this breaks UK sanctions? https://t.co/KXOAkSWtV1

@moorehn @jeffjarvis But generates a lot too! Waste is always good business.
@moorehn @jeffjarvis Well, except in “she’s so shrill, isn’t she?” There was a fascinating thing after the 2016 debates of swapping the genders of the participants, but keeping the same words and mannerisms. Audience reaction very interesting. (NYU, so guessing Jeff saw it.) https://t.co/uPTs0hTH5i
@bender_077 I’m using a 6yo MB Pro, 4yo iPad Pro.. they work fine.
@bennyj80 @asymco @BenBajarin You mean people buying old handsets? Or old handsets being passed down? Both are dark matter - there’s essentially zero visibility on the size or velocity or dynamics of the markets. Have to be inferred from device use stats.
@jeffjarvis @moorehn I maintain my hypothesis that cable news is toxic waste, and haven’t found anything to contradict. This offers more confirming data.
@CraigGrannell @PenLlawen @adambanksdotcom @reneritchie I can do awful if you really want..
@CraigGrannell @adambanksdotcom @reneritchie Miser
@PenLlawen @CraigGrannell @adambanksdotcom @reneritchie Sure - that’s the value-add argument beyond the smart TVs.
@PenLlawen @adambanksdotcom @CraigGrannell @reneritchie Agree.. hence getting iTunes Movie Store built into Samsung Smart TVs, per CES https://t.co/3s4Me8D2WG
@IlariLehti @asymco Going to be very interested in how the testing went for that in Finland and Canada during winter.
@adambanksdotcom @CraigGrannell @reneritchie So you get iTunes (App/Content store) built in, which I believe has been announced by Samsung and LG this week?
@alexhern Just note, do not carry the flame in a tiki torch
@PenLlawen @CraigGrannell @adambanksdotcom @reneritchie But if more TVs come with iTunes and AirPlay 2, that’s closer to the Android TV strategy.,
@ccoignard @russellfrost @asymco Apple didn’t issue the warning during the quarter. That ended Dec 29. The letter to shareholders was Jan 2.
@alexhern Ah yes. Carry the flame with pride, dude.
@IlariLehti @asymco Geometry says something’s being extended when the screen goes from flat to folded. Unless it remains the same width and goes into recesses at the side when flattened.
@cathcam @MColvinMcKenzie @MazMHussain #humblebrag which is probably what you’d have been paying at all the points below that salary for US health insurance..
@CraigGrannell @adambanksdotcom @reneritchie Hmm. Well “Android TV” hasn’t killed Chromecast, though perhaps it has reduced its TAM. On that basis, yes, ATV might fade away once there are enough smart TVs with iTunes/AP2. A bit like Airport Express etc.
@moorehn Take it you’ve seen @jeffjarvis’s article. As he says, “she is cool in every way”. Social media politics done right.
@IlariLehti @asymco That is a good question, actually. I’m fascinated by how the mechanics of it works: does something stretch, or something move, when the screen is folded over? How robust is that over cold temperatures and many many thousands of folds?
@IlariLehti @asymco Knew there had to be a good reason
@moorehn The thing to watch now will be whether her popularity - which is going to be a “gotcha” magnet for lots of Pol Twitter - will manage to tear down that sham.
@CraigGrannell @adambanksdotcom @reneritchie TV is a space they *have* to be in. But they aren’t prepared to iPod it - to offer many different things to cover all desires.  Consider Amazon: Fire Stick (way to make people watch Prime) Google: Chromecast (so you’ll watch YT). ATV is a means to that end too - iTunes content.
@moorehn The AOC thing has been incredible to watch in so many ways.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie No argument here
@bender_077 Very few people do. Most used to do it biannually, for PCs, then it moved to three, four, five years. Tablets: started at annual, quickly became three or four years. Phones are now at three-year upgrade cycles. So people need a new one. Question is, when?
@CraigGrannell @PenLlawen @reneritchie I think they hoped at the relaunch (2016?) they’d have all the US networks offering themselves as apps. Apple TV! All your networks and you can cut the cable!  They didn’t. Not even close.
So many of the tweets in this thread would be epic on their own. The whole thing is terrific. (You can also read it in one gulp here: https://t.co/5Ye3o0rBaz ) https://t.co/TGN6GLJ8ub
@MColvinMcKenzie @MazMHussain (Nor Brits..)
@moorehn @threadreaderapp unroll
@PenLlawen @CraigGrannell @reneritchie Price-sensitive to cost of console, I meant. Once that’s done, it’s “pour all the money down into the hole in the ground.” I have two teenage boys, y’know.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie Killing Game Center was quite a tell about its intent. But “social gaming” didn’t work out in that venue, unlike on consoles.  Freemium took over because it’s just better suited to the platform and the format that it forces for games. Not every mobile game can be Monument Valley.
His original tweet (he screenshots it) and his rationale  are both interesting. As he says, perhaps it’s wrong. But also perhaps it’s dead right, in which case it needs more light shed on it. https://t.co/nMZTwUJcG8
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie Why did they quit?
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie Why do they hate it? Because of what? (ATV was never going to be a games console without a controller, which Apple apparently didn’t want to do.)
@CraigGrannell “I’ve discovered the identity of the killer by the pattern of keys worn down on this keyboard! It’s uniqueeeeeeeemaybe not.”
@relequestual @MazMHussain Now need details of SK health. I’ve been there, and the infrastructure is solid.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie Games consoles are a losing game. Market limited to ~70m. Hugely competitive. Ultra-price sensitive. Depends on getting top-flight games. The Switch succeeded because of Mario and the other Ninty games. The form factor helped (v the Wii U especially) but content wins.
@CraigGrannell @pricivius You’re seriously asking why A, S and C might be worn down and not others? Here’s the iPad Pro keyboard I’m typing on. Observe which keys look worn.. https://t.co/PmOV7RKPj1
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie I think in that there are two conflicts, both tending to slow upgrades: Intel isn’t hitting its targets, and Apple is considering very carefully how to make a transition to ARM.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie True - the difference using Roku and an Apple TV is pretty colossal if, say, you’re just watching NFLX or Amazon Prime.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie Spotify’s best hope is to become a label. Basically, a Netflix of sound.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie Ok - best I can say is my experience differs. (Ditto for my family: we chug along fine. Even use a shared calendar for family/spouse stuff.)
@CraigGrannell @pricivius Fingernails?
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie I think it’s clear there have been screwups - the Mac keyboard and the Mac Pro really stand out as examples. In other areas, the problem is almost “too much money”: easy to commission tons of video, hard to make good stuff. Ask Netflix on that one.
@CraigGrannell @reneritchie The hit in China is because there isn’t a new design: this is the weakness of the S years (which arguably should be dumped, Ben Thompson argues, and I agree). Phone slowdown is global. Services were weak in the past; are they now? I find them very reliable. Next stop: video.
@reneritchie One can see that Apple wanted to get its warning out in a timely fashion. But imagine if by some chance they’d all waited a week. Ach, would probably be the same story tho. “LG, Samsung.. sure. Apple??? OMG!!”
@wboscoho True, but China hasn’t actually been a key growth market since 2015, going by the data. (Data: Apple; horrendous presentation: mine) https://t.co/0jHnvGbh7p
@wboscoho I prefer Go, but anyhow. There’s a lot of money sloshing around China for venture funds and basically anything - banks can prop up companies or ignore as they’re told.
@reneritchie “inner Forbes Contributor Network troll” 😂😂
@wboscoho Do Chinese carriers subsidise? I thought they were full price. Or are there other subsidies you’re thinking of?
@edbott Would that be smaller companies, or the Google/Amazon/Microsofts of this world slowing down their data centre (sp) spend? If latter, should show up in capex numbers.
@Black_Kettle That’s webOS for ya
@russellfrost @asymco Do you seriously think that anyone at Apple believes the world owes them a continued existence? I bet Night Sight, for example, put a huge fright into the camera team.  I’m confident they saw the general phone slowdown coming. Anyone who reads analyst reports knew 2 yrs ago.
@kentindell Lots of spare GPU chips now nobody’s mining bitcoin.
@Marthalanefox @harrym Should list in bio 😜
@edbott Yup - though of course phones are the principal consumer of memory and other chips now. Certainly though there’s a crunch happening.
@asymco https://t.co/hbSbdAVJTK
@harrym @Marthalanefox Except that Veep now offers a far more realistic view of events. (Veep is top of recommendations - especially the Silicon Valley episode - if you haven’t seen it.)
(HT @aadetugbo for the pointer to the LG stuff.)
@peetm I was wondering how one would repurpose this for the current era. Tweets, obviously.
To clarify - Samsung is also warning that profits will fall ~29% yoy and revenues will be down ~11% https://t.co/7mVaPKZtSm  PC market data for Q4 will come out this week, and that’s not likely to be happy reading either. https://t.co/hbSbdAVJTK
LG Electronics warns on revenues and profit (mobile business has lost money since Q2 2015) same day that Samsung warns on profit (smartphone biz down). Lenovo has lost money in phones since Q1 2014. Anyway, tell me more about Apple’s problem after its second-biggest fiscal Q1. https://t.co/JluwWISAKU
@lilianedwards No reason that won’t happen this time too.
@sameer_singh17 Yup, that’s definitely true. The best time for existing companies to start a video streaming subscription service is about 10 years ago, apparently.
Watched part of All The President’s Men last night: the end sequence show a teleprinter writing up headlines from the period after the film bit ends. The headlines cover Nixon’s cronies pleading guilty and being sentenced to jail terms. Feels familiar. https://t.co/tJWkgRHPIQ
@sameer_singh17 Well, hence all the smart TV announcements this week, which will have been in the works for a long time: means to get payable content on more devices. They can read a smartphone growth forecast same as anyone.
@sameer_singh17 Certainly. The question of “what new feature would make you buy a new phone?” has become very difficult to answer for many people.
@sameer_singh17 They called out everything but the kitchen sink! But diversification is clearly their aim now - that, plus the upgrade program. Samsung’s path less clear. Components and screens apart (risk of being commoditised?), they’re getting eaten by rival Android OEMs.
@brooklynmarie @Susan_Hennessey It is astonishing that a cabinet member can outright lie and dissemble in this way and not be held to account by every single media outlet that hasn’t lost its mind.
@sameer_singh17 The source of the problems is very different, though. Apple’s XS isn’t differentiated enough from the X; Samsung isn’t differentiated enough from all the other Android phones.  Overall ASPs in China are rising, I think - but the market there is slowing.
@jaykannan Samsung has been in the phone business for decades. Way longer than Apple.  Re Huawei: “rose 15 percent for the first half of the year, without breaking out results for its smartphone or other divisions.” Probably phones but you can’t tell. Meanwhile global smartphone biz shrank.

@oliviasolon @juliacarriew @DaveLeeBBC @edzitron I love this thread for all the imputations of what went wrong
@ImBackB98416852 @BriannaWu Toxic embrace of insurance companies (which have gone from nowhere 40-50 years ago to be among the largest Fortune 500 companies) and hospitals cpnspiring to push up prices, with little rationale for constraint.  A monopsony system (“Medicare for all”) can constrain them.
@tculpan The marathon-personal-timing market? Yeah, not sure Apple has quite aimed at that niche.
@ImBackB98416852 @BriannaWu @mmasnick I hear you. It’s a bad situation and you have my sympathies.
@stuartmiles @davidphelan @ce_wg @SushiRokuLV Happy unbirthday! Guess you’ve got 363 more of those this year. Get busy!
@margotlily I hope this doesn’t mean “I’m now working at a checkout”. Also it turns out standing desks don’t improve things, don’t blame me
@JamalBloodhound @BriannaWu @mmasnick Mild correction: American capitalism is. Or possibly the other developed countries have figured out where the boundary should be.
Once more, Apple isn’t exhibiting at CES; it just lets everyone else do it for them. https://t.co/GICXiVXp7N
@BroadsNAtl You could. But people wouldn’t pay for it, because while ~everyone has a phone, not everyone has a laptop. More people in the group [have a phone] than [don’t have phone, have laptop]. If you mean the front (selfie) camera on the phone v laptop webcam - same thing. Price v use.
@ImBackB98416852 @BriannaWu @mmasnick I think it’s the trying to pay the outrageous charges that leads to the bankrupcty. If it’s unsecured credit, as I understand it is, there is limited recourse. Bankruptcy perhaps a last step. Again, though, why penalise people for being ill? It’s perverse in a developed country.
@gak_pdx Ah, that’s a slightly different argument. Quite how one costs the provision of personal services like this, where you don’t want people noodling off on their own (see also: prisons), is going to be very different from services where you can trust the user.
@JamalBloodhound @BriannaWu @mmasnick The salient question is why people who are injured should be penalised financially at all.
@BriannaWu @mmasnick Is it correct to say though that such debts are unsecured, though, and hence they can’t seize property etc? In other words, tell the debt collectors to make an accommodation and pay a lot less?
Lol “confidential legal communication not for publication”. Also feel they could have added “is not a space alien” and a few more to make it the round 150. https://t.co/qCpBWcA2lR

@teroterotero “Who names their child after a car?”, to quote A Fish Called Wanda.
@ShiraOvide It might be a big if. I’m pretty confident about the total download number; the question would be about retention. Don’t forget the Google Android universe is over 2x bigger than the iOS one. So that’s quite a low conversion rate.
@Black_Kettle @gak_pdx Yup. In the US you also have to factor in potential access to firearms and potential for greater harm.
@ShiraOvide Here’s what I emailed someone back in November. Then it was perhaps 6.9m users by my estimate; perhaps now up to 7m. I estimate by comparing number of reviews on Google Play v download milestones. https://t.co/o4b4NyV5Kj

@jaykannan I don’t think he said immune. He said China was going fine. But that was beginning of Nov; things changed after that. Most of Apple’s growth has been coming from Americas and Europe, for a long time. China is the green (third down) line.  https://t.co/GjG32XdFdr

@alexhern @McKelvie Long flights are definitely the perfect way to watch films you would never in a million years pay for or spend time at home watching.
@jeffjarvis @davewiner What would it look like though? This was what I couldn’t grok from your article, Jeff.
@SimonMoores @Coneee Flipping heck. That’s a lot of paint, and that will be a lot of lorries if it happens.
Spotify users have been asking (and/or demanding) that it introduce two-factor authentication since at least 2013. It still hasn’t. Result: https://t.co/2B3n9tPk3m
@jaykannan China’s entire phone market has been shrinking for a number of quarters. That isn’t due to Apple. The global smartphone market has shrunk for two years. Again, that’s not due to Apple. You need to stop looking at one company and look at the entirety of what’s happening.
@jaykannan It’s already a large enough price to deter many people. Yet lots of people own iPhones. Perhaps the carriers will revert to a subsidy model to boost sales. If upgrades lengthen, that would work to their benefit.
@jimbomorrison Oh yes, the “Roscoebdavis1” account is an expert in “gas chromatigraphy” apparently. In other news: Gateway Pundit remains a reliable source of utter nonsense. It’s a pity it’s not produced on a write-only medium.
@macinteractive Yes, a mixture of those two is basically where we’re heading. Children Of Men is scarily realistic, given it was made in 2006.
@jaykannan For most people it’s still easier not to move (which is why most don’t). But sure, the boundaries between ecosystems are becoming weaker. Still exist, though. If you were a mad keen Fortnite player, you’d wait a long time for your Pocophone to get it, I bet.
And meanwhile in Brexitland https://t.co/AqZIWD3Amd
@jaykannan Precisely: it’s tougher on the carriers - but they’ll just hike data prices and come up with inventive scams, at least in the US.  But again, look at the numbers and what Apple said. The shortfall in phone sales is in China - “more than 100%”. So grew elsewhere. Probably iPhones.
Ooh, this is fun detective work (for 0830 UK Twitter). Hope it survives to the US news cycle. https://t.co/3nh8dwcvN2
@jaykannan “Ended” is possibly not the word you’re looking for here. Huawei has a huge and profitable network gear business to subsidise its super-thin-margin phone business. Xiaomi, hmm, let’s see. Oppo, ditto.  Point is it’s all China, but that’s slowing down. Await developments.
@thechoosened1 @Matt_S_Stephens Yes, my question exactly. Do men who sleep around become less feminine? Less masculine? More masculine? Because they’re wasting that sacred act, y’know.
@jaykannan If you’re constrained to spending $300, or if you view that as a reasonable ceiling, then you’re probably not interested in whatever bells and whistles are on offer. Plus: companies doing that are in a race to the bottom. It ends badly.
@fascinatorfun @georgebernhard Indeed. He’s a study in his own right.
@jaykannan Noooooonsense. Upgrade cycle is longer everywhere.
@IbleedFish @mdrockwell @initialcharge Never heard of two of them and I follow the industry quite closely. The phones sales figures is a different topic relating to China and the saturated market. Learn to discern what matters.
@jaykannan Samsung lost out in China long before it was jacking up prices. Looking forward to you explaining that.
@IbleedFish @mdrockwell @initialcharge None of those have been solid issues. IOS hasn’t bricked phones. AirPod s don’t have connectivity issues. Haven’t even heard of the X screen stuff. The “bending” - unproven so far.   Keyboards though definitely not good.
@JohnLamont Yup that’s a dream.
@Psychobel @mdrockwell @initialcharge Haven’t bought one of those keyboards for myself.
@IbleedFish @mdrockwell @initialcharge AirPods? IPad Pro? IPhone X? IOS 12? You might need to think a bit harder on these absolutes.
@Tanni_GT @RayLGar See whatcha did there
Oh man, the new MacBook Air has the same keyboard problems? Even if it’s a tiny number, it’s just not good enough. Apple dumped the hockey puck mouse because it was BAD.  Time to do the same to the butterfly kbd, as @mdrockwell of @initialcharge says here  https://t.co/Z215qrSjzZ https://t.co/KYgrjEagkT
@JohnLamont Yes, that column totally put his finger on it. The whole “listen to the members” thing is an utter con.
The survey was of 25k UK adults, carried out by YouGov. Such a large sample (10x the standard opinion poll for elections) could have all sorts of flaws in its design and still produce a robust reflection of peoples’ views:  Labour is stuffed if it doesn’t back a second vote. https://t.co/GEKYIqPGrv
@jeffjarvis I’m now so fascinated by the question of how/whether she and Trump (or their avatars, social media mavens, whatever) will interact on Twitter. Who will quote-tweet whom first? (For that is, in your lovely phrase, the sniper’s position.)
@jaykannan Overstated as an effect; China is bigger. However you’ll now see all the smartphone industry struggle with lengthening cycles. Samsung’s unit sales are down 10% yoy, but it doesn’t make forecasts in the same way. Oppo and vivo will struggle with profit. They all will.
@lordmatty Royal Mail, but for anyone it’s only a matter of time.
This is indeed a terrific analysis. And it helps with comprehending what McLuhan meant about “hot” and “cool”, by way of Nixon, JFK, Trump and AOC. (Hmm. Three-letter acronymic politicians. Intriguing.) https://t.co/PBoQOBnHx9

@alanrew Certainly - but notice how she has moved the Overton window on taxation miles to the left with just a few comments. No trivial accomplishment.
@meteorradiation It’s true; there’s a story that every American views themselves as a millionaire who just happens not to have a million dollars at the moment you ask.
@kentindell Of course. But there are plenty of counter-narratives to tax avoidance: “are these people not proud of their country? Why are they freeloading instead of paying their fair share?” Etc.
The president of “[Rich Old White] Americans For Tax Reform” doesn’t understand how marginal tax systems work. Taxing the first million at 25% and the next at 70%, for example, leaves you with 1.15m, not 600k. https://t.co/pv3CWaWgiW

@UniquelyGillian @MalwareJake Yes, it does, unless government intervenes to force drug pricing down by mandating generics, or mandating drug prices.
@andrewchen Sounds similar to the 95% confidence method. You look at something and assume you’re seeing it during 95% (1/40th-39/40ths) of its life. Thus you can predict its likely lifespan - between 40x to 1.025x its current one. Ballpark, but surprisingly effective.
@jonhoneyball @bazzacollins Knew it..
@jonhoneyball @bazzacollins Sounds like you’re CESing too then Jon. (I’m not - in the departure lounge at LAX on the way home..)

@mathewi Yes.
@tculpan Is it though? Net losses have been in the $100m or so. Could last a few years on $1bn.
@CandiceC_W @GraziaUK SO terrific. Come on 2019!
@tculpan That December revenue figure is US$44m, if I have my conversion correct. That barely keeps the lights on. One has to wonder what the HTC board’s exit strategy is. That $1bn from Google won’t last forever, and there’s zero sign of them finding a new profitable business.
I’m a moped/motorcycle owner in a movie. I parked it over there while I went in to the shop, obviously I left it running because everyone does, apart from everyone else in this movie, and –––DAMMIT WHY DOES THE WHITE GUY ALWAYS STEAL MY BIKE https://t.co/yT3LtQ5ZvJ
The initial tweet on its own would be good enough, but the thread is excellent and thought-provoking. (And to my mind offers the best view on the Louis CK thing I’ve seen all week.) https://t.co/uec2jSEdo0
@edabny62 @moorehn He’s not making a policy. He’s talking his usual word salad. Nothing would have been lost by ignoring everything he said there. If you choose to focus on every word he says and impute deep meaning to it, you’re missing the wood for the bark on the trees.
@moorehn Could we maybe ignore things Trump says unless they have a direct effect on lives? I feel everyone would benefit.
@nevali It’s here. https://t.co/QBsawVwApR
@getwired Yes; but he’s not *your* emergency to deal with. Solve what you can solve, not what you cannot.
@eric_e @stevesi You are mistaking “sales share” for installed base. Apple has a huge installed base of iPhones and other stuff. The smartphone market isn’t growing appreciably. So the platforms are static.
This is an important point (especially since these devices are moving out of “early adopter/innovator” users to “early majority” (https://t.co/pRAmPvl6iC). How many use them, and for what?  Amazon has this data. So do Google and Apple.  The silence is notable. https://t.co/vX1ojl2MlA
@getwired Please just get a better set of mute words? Can suggest a few.
@lucysherriff 😂😂
@oliviasolon @jemimakiss “Possible” sexual abuse? I never cease to be amazed at the knots that Americans tie themselves in just so they can do both sides.
@Lucas_Rotondo @neilcybart @Jens_Krueger @AboveAvalonPlus 😂
@Lucas_Rotondo @neilcybart @Jens_Krueger @AboveAvalonPlus So what did you do if the XR was too cheap but the XS too expensive?
@tubsturtle She’s a big dog and she likes her walks.
Hacking new year. Here’s a thing. https://t.co/KuL2mWihaX
@Ed_Manning @cathynewman Ta. That clarifies.
This is the thread you want to understand Apple in China. https://t.co/qfG9X8wUNe
@SN0rth “What are you going to do with my email address?” “Sell it.” “Who to?” “Anyone who pays.” There’s no consent model there. You can’t limit how many times your email will be sold. This is the problem: you can’t check what happens to your data. Asymmetric power.
@SN0rth @nytimestech The mismatch here is gigantic, plus the silent signup to subscription services. Maybe try reading the story more carefully.
@jaykannan @CCSInsight Smartphone market in China has been shrinking. If the notch is silly, why do so many Chinese phones have it? As for the Chinese brands.. let’s see how things are in a year or two. Could be the commodity market wins. Or it could be there’s no longevity in zero margins.
@SN0rth @nytimestech The amount and detail of the data is out of line to the service being offered.
@jaykannan @CCSInsight GDP or smartphone market? China smartphone market shrank, maybe by 10% or more.
Hello, I’m a fruit cart owner, and each day I wheel my fruit cart along the street and OH FER CRISSAKE AGAIN?? https://t.co/h3z0dQIYtb
@girlonetrack Then again many didn’t know he’s British so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Useful thread on ships and boats and ownership. https://t.co/WazktqKapX
@bilbocroft Don’t know. Check at https://t.co/9TIFvOOyBS.
@StevenFeldman @dabeeeenster “Number of boats”
@cathynewman I’ll go with Hanlon’s Razor (cockup trumps conspiracy) rather than Machiavelli for this one.
You’d hope the AP exec editor might have some sort of say in whether stories about useless horse race polls projecting forward get generated, at least at AP. https://t.co/nY6V1ePbB2
@cathynewman https://t.co/RjfLZjJ6Bo
@caro_milanesi @bryanbma @DaveLeeBBC Seems @neiltwitz from Counterpoint dialling in quite a big overall fall. Not sure how that translates for C4Q. https://t.co/uk8hbTL3Ov https://t.co/yT57FCeIv5
@cathynewman But Grayling should have been able to say that if it were the case. (He should know… right?)
@alanrew Well, it seems that way.
@alanrew Think of it more as batteries running out. He does.
@StevenFeldman But believe there was meant to have been. It’s a government contract, hence should be under EU tender rules.
What do we give it, three days before the contract is revoked when it is discovered that the tender wasn’t done correctly? https://t.co/KPZ1XkXWNu
Hmm. The golf lacuna is very noticeable. And contrast: 27 in 2018, v 42 in 2017. I’d say the job is grinding him down. (Plus, perhaps, the rallies in Oct/Nov for the midterms.) https://t.co/D6nCYYsjw2 https://t.co/8dLIXBdxj1
@bryanbma @DaveLeeBBC Thanks, Bryan.
@bryanbma @DaveLeeBBC @IDC @Gartner_inc @CounterPointTR @SA_Update @caro_milanesi @fjeronimo @benwood What expectations for the China market?
Ha, made a mistake myself. As @edbott points out, I pointed to the yoy change. But China revenue was nowhere near 41% of Apple’s global; try 18.1%. https://t.co/nYGVXHJvIn https://t.co/wbJzzH6W8X
Err @CCSInsight I think you might want to revise this guidance note. The rest of it makes sense but this is kinda bad. https://t.co/aKYPbkHELz https://t.co/fB11a3kOAs
@jaykannan @Apple Doesn’t that apply to Samsung, LG, and others selling premium phones? Indeed, to anyone selling a phone in China? If all you need is something that runs WeChat, the cheapest possible device will suffice.
Many good insights in @neilcybart’s @AboveAvalonPlus newsletter today. Clues about what seems to be a deceleration in China from November onwards. If Cook was confident about sales in the earnings call, having seen October data, what changed?  Also a lower delta for phone sales. https://t.co/WIT13v7qP3
@bigbluewolf_ The implicit thinking that one *needs* to upgrade and that the only option available is the £1k version is interesting to observe.
Wonderful film, with many echoes of Roadside Picnic (filmed as Stalker). Garland is doing such great work in SF. https://t.co/5DPTr4AhTV
@teroterotero Galvin?
@CedarTreeAdvice It has been flat globally for two years. China, the biggest market, has contracted for a few quarters in a row, I believe. All important context; all missing from many writeups.
Amid all the noise about Apple’s iPhone sales, has anyone asked the analyst companies (@idc, @Gartner_inc, @CounterPointTR, @SA_Update) what they think total smartphone sales for C4Q are going to be - up, down, sideways? Seems like this would be relevant context.
@alexbrooks @benthompson @buildthefutures Yes, I got that wrong - it was 2002. I was thinking of the end 2000 period when they were just about to move into the iPod, and had made the wrong bet on CD-R v DVD. It was a period when they dipped in and out of profit; selling ARM shares helped shore things up.
@cimota Could be, and the XR price cuts were an attempt to make up the shortfall.
@rr Thanks so much for the Longmire recommendation. Each hour episode basically gets as much plot as Wind River did in 100. Entertaining. A little bit Rockford Files too. Kinda sorta.
@robertdenton People aren’t allowed to have carefully judged opinions? BTIG is a company with a track record. The estimate makes sense based on the GM remaining stable and the drop in forecast revenues.
That’s a big estimate - estimates iPhone sales in C4Q were &lt;64m, down 18%. That surely puts Huawei in 2nd place for smartphone volume in C4Q.  BTIG estimates that “everything else” grew 19%, including wearables and others. Things are shifting. https://t.co/KcQY3LaU7s
@meteorradiation Yeah - it’s the iPhone 5C thing again, but at a higher price.
Terrific thread with lots of insights. 👏👏 https://t.co/9SrdqX4JzH
@reneritchie @JoannaStern However then there’s the China thing. That is a whole other scenario where one suspects @benthompson’s theory about WeChat is coming home to roost.
@reneritchie @JoannaStern Scene: INT DAY APPLE STORE Shopper 1: hmm, a new iPhone for.. HOW MUCH? Shopper 2: I got a new battery for my phone. Works great. $29/£29 [edit for location] Shopper 1 [to passing Apple Store person]: hello, I’d like a Genius Bar appointment.  #QED
@baseballtipster @guardian At 2am, better not to have any illumination. Interferes with sleep. (I’m not in GMT.) Sleep well.
@baseballtipster @guardian You read it imagining I had written it, it had been subbed by someone else who then put it on the web all on January 1st? I guess I’m flattered for what it says about my work ethic.
@baseballtipster @guardian 2018.
