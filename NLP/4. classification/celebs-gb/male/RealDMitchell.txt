@robthor @Breathwick It really is - what an incredible achievement!
@mfirouz Hi Mo! And yes, wasn’t she amazing!
Oh my God! That’s amazing! And what a brilliant speech! #OliviaColman
@PlanetSlade Do you know, I actually filed it as ‘worse’ and the subs asked to change it to ‘worst’ and I agreed because it sounded clearer.
@MaySting1 @ObsNewReview Why bring Trump into this?
@JeremyBennett @ObsNewReview If the electorate isn’t ready for PR then it’s not ready to avert the nation’s terminal decline.
@JazzyJaney @ObsNewReview Thanks Rhianna - and yes that referendum was a wasted opportunity in so many ways.
@ManolisEm @ObsNewReview Thanks Manolis!

@djingonthenet No.
@JazzyJaney I’m afraid there’s no news at the moment.
ITV doesn’t make much comedy, so it’s nice to see a new one-liner comedy show being tried out on ITV1. It’s also nice to see stand-up comedians getting some fresh air. It’s on at 10.25pm this Saturday. #OutThereITV
@EvelyneSassoon Thanks - very nice of you to say!
@goneforapint @ObsNewReview Good point. Though in some cases the surrounding ground predates the houses built on it.
@yelpocyaldnif @AngelosantoK @ObsNewReview Well if you like industrial architecture and you’re used to drawn curtains, those flats by the Tate sound PERFECT for you. And I’ve heard the prices are coming down for some reason.
@yelpocyaldnif @AngelosantoK @ObsNewReview Plus they look so striking.
@JazzyJaney @ObsNewReview Thanks!
@thunderratz @ObsNewReview That sounds ideal - like living in a limo.
@megszee That’s just what the judge suggested.
@yelpocyaldnif @AngelosantoK @ObsNewReview That’s extremely public spirited of you!
@darklands101 They’re perfect if you want to put on a show.
@AngelosantoK @ObsNewReview Well, you’re very much in line with the latest judicial thinking!
@ShahrukhBhatty @ObsNewReview To be honest, I found it quite heartening that this whole case suggests that some of the flats are actually lived in. Though I suspect you’re right that the more expensive ones, which aren’t overlooked, are probably empty!
@AngelosantoK @ObsNewReview Fair enough - but I do feel sorry for them, though of course I fully accept that it could have been worse.
@kitty_pert @ObsNewReview Good point. It wasn’t reported that the developers would have known in advance - but, if so, they’re the ones the residents should take issue with.
@alpacnologia @ObsNewReview Yes - there’s no doubt that it’s refreshing.
@AngelosantoK @ObsNewReview Yes, but do you feel sorry for them? It must have been a nasty surprise when that viewing platform opened.
@TotaGualion @ObsNewReview Excellent idea!
@Jim1810 @ObsNewReview No, it doesn’t. I quite agree that that would have made the case very different.

@Lakedistrictent Yes, we’re supposed to be filming in the autumn.

@EvelyneSassoon Because it’s a reference to the following but of Peep Show, a sitcom I was in: https://t.co/wwu0ZsUWbQ .
@j_d_mcknight Thanks, and yes it will.
@ReflectiveCat_2 Yes, that’s part of the plan.
@katyjmitchell @ObsNewReview Thanks, and nice surname.

@cenricce Well, yes. Not so much “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it” as “If it ain’t TOTALLY broke, and you’re an idiot, don’t touch it”.
@TheTonySlattery A terrifying honour indeed! Hope it went well - I’m sure you were brilliant.
There’s another @WILTY_TV Special on tonight at 8pm on @BBCOne, featuring all the best bits from series 12. If you’ve missed the whole series, it’s a great summary of the main points.
@JonnnyBest @I_Jay @UnbelieveTruth @BBCRadio4 @LouSanders @zoelyons @henningwehn Don’t worry, that was just a joke about Henning’s discovery that remaining silent was the best way to play the game. We’re recording more this month.
Do you think there’s ever been a French restaurant called Horses For Courses?
It’s the last in the current series of @UnbelieveTruth today at 6.30pm on @BBCRadio4. Guests are @LouSanders, Lloyd Langford, @zoelyons and @henningwehn.
@happydcg @ObsNewReview https://t.co/tjCRwvMA5o
My ⁦@ObsNewReview⁩ column today is about the weird modern phenomenon of restaurant chains: overnight, a new chain seems to be everywhere. Over the next night, it seems like they’ve all closed. https://t.co/XY72SAmA0M

@MaySting1 @BBCOne @WILTY_TV @RealBobMortimer @henningwehn @missdianemorgan @EmmaBunton @RonJichardson @lucyportercomic @wilty Thanks!
@MissMcIntyre1 The plan is to shoot it later in the year.
Tonight at 8pm on @BBCOne is a compilation of 100% unseen material from the last series of @WILTY_TV. It features such luminaries as Jo Brand, @RealBobMortimer, @henningwehn, @missdianemorgan, @EmmaBunton, @RonJichardson &amp; @lucyportercomic. (Hope you) Enjoy (it)!
@YehudaShapiro @davidkarlin Absolutely! And I appreciate the offer.
@ConorFarrington @BBCTwo @BBCiPlayer Sorry about that. I don’t know who does the subtitling. Maybe it’s a computer.
@YehudaShapiro @davidkarlin Sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude by not replying. Thank you very much for the invitations, but I have actually been to the opera on more than one occasion, and I’m afraid I don’t think it’s for me.
The new series continues today at 6.30pm on @BBCRadio4. https://t.co/oH4WS5zXYr
@KristianGiblin Not to worry at all - and thank you!
@Dr_Tabor Thanks and glad to hear it.
@KristianGiblin @TurnageTime So the absence of embarrassment is pride? I’m not convinced. Anyway, comedians often say things about themselves in public which they are a bit (or sometimes very) embarrassed about. It’s a way of attempting to amuse people.
@TurnageTime Why do you infer pride? I meant it self-deprecatingly. But I suppose I’m not very ashamed that I don’t know much about music - perhaps I should be - but that doesn’t mean I’m proud of it, or that I think knowing lots about it is bad.
@filiphatton So do I. My brain is reluctant to absorb a tune and words at the same time.
@Howard_Goodall @ObsNewReview Thanks - very glad you approve. And that microphone debate must generate a lot of fun.
You certainly seem to have comprehensively refuted my point about snobbery in the opera world. https://t.co/TNZmUCXh7K
In my ⁦@ObsNewReview⁩ column today: a row in the opera world which, thankfully, is about anything but the music. https://t.co/KeTZQJghTQ
Another brand new episode of @WILTY_TV is on @BBCOne tonight - but it’s at 9pm instead of 9.30pm. So if you tune in at the same time as last week, you’ll have to use @BBCiPlayer. Our excellent guests are @StaceyDooley, @henningwehn, @MissAlexjones and @rachelparris.
@Geoff_McGivern @anthony_reuben @UnbelieveTruth That sounds pretty plausible. I doubt it settled though or there’d be footage.
@RusticR @BBCRadio4 @LouSanders @zoelyons @henningwehn Thank you - and get well soon.
Thank you, @anthony_reuben! I would only add that, even on the rare occasions that it does snow in late March, there’s still only a roughly one in four chance that it’s happening in a year when Easter isn’t in April. @UnbelieveTruth https://t.co/fFL9ntZfSA
@tecfrigogo @BBCRadio4 @LouSanders @zoelyons @henningwehn You’re very welcome indeed. I’m extremely glad to hear they helped.
Another new episode of The Unbelievable Truth is on tonight (6.30pm, @BBCRadio4), this time featuring the vocalised brain output of @LouSanders, Lloyd Langford, @zoelyons and @henningwehn.

@dnewells90 You’re welcome! I’m very glad you enjoy them.
There’s a brand new episode of ⁦@WILTY_TV⁩ on TONIGHT at 9.30pm on ⁦@BBCOne⁩. It’s the same series that started going out in the autumn, and here is the line-up (first in Twitter handles, then in faces): @ronanofficial, @ToffTalks, @rhodgilbertshow &amp; @EllieJaneTaylor. https://t.co/oge0wTZXkw
@davidmitchellhi Hi there! Nice art work - pity about the choice of subject.
@iamfinlay @TomPage_CMS @lizmaybrice Now I understand what the Bar Book was for - it was an early analogue version of social media! This must be what it feels like to be a millennial.
Episode 3 of the new series of The Unbelievable Truth is on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm today. @sanditoksvig, @RonJichardson, @lucyportercomic and @GraemeGarden1 are among the guests. And are all of the guests.
@chrispapps2 @NekoCase There are nine.
@MrJamesBachman I’m pretty sure that was my own hair.
I know it doesn’t feel like it but, strictly speaking, it’s Monday, which means that episode 2 of the new series of The Unbelievable Truth is on. It features @richardosman, @wiggywalsh, @SusanCalman and @phlaimeaux and is on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm.
@Bobbless4 I think he just seemed a bit celestial.

@JazzyJaney @TimDownie1 @robrouse @garethmammal @WhelanGemma @spendals Excellent work! Glad you enjoyed the show. Happy Christmas!
@GylesB1 Thanks Gyles - so glad you enjoyed it. Great to bump into you earlier. Merry Christmas.
Happy Christmas everyone! If you’re looking for a break from all the endless Christmassiness then probably don’t watch the #UpstartCrow Christmas Special, which is on @BBCTwo at 8.35pm tonight, because it is pretty Christmassy. It also contains humour and Kenneth Branagh.
@bllackholesofus Thanks - happy Christmas!
@Makins100 @Retro_Co @arobertwebb Yes.
@GVFB I must admit that looks pretty much as described.
@OliverMaltman @JamesAcaster Glad you enjoyed it! Have a very merry Christmas.
I’ve just realised than a brand new series of “The Unbelievable Truth” also starts today, on @BBCRadio4. For details, see below. https://t.co/EOePoEKW3R

@Gem_StoneRose @BBCiPlayer I’m very sorry to hear that.
@ferrifrump @BBCiPlayer Thanks so much, Jennifer. I’m very glad you liked it.
People are asking if there'll be any more #UpstartCrow and I'm happy to say there's a Christmas Special for 2018 starring Kenneth Branagh! We'd also love to make a fourth series, but that's up to the BBC. So fingers crossed, as Shakespeare said. I'm pretty sure that's one of his.
I'm extremely touched, and proud, to have received so many lovely messages about the conclusion to series 3 of #UpstartCrow last night. Thank you so much. If you missed it, it's here on @BBCiPlayer, along with every previous episode we've made. https://t.co/MX1hXWlw74
The last #UpstartCrow of the series is on in 15 minutes on @BBCTwo! Hope you like it.
Hooray! We’re going to be a one party state! https://t.co/OTIUhpMPNy
@robsmithjersey Thank you! Very glad you liked it.
And I’m afraid tonight’s #UpstartCrow is really not very similar to Great British Menu at all. So apologies for that.
Damn, I should have said “season finale”. Except actual seasons don’t have finales - they just merge anticlimactically into the next season. So the end of a “season” of a show would be when it gets slightly like whatever is on the next week. In this case Great British Menu. https://t.co/idEglgC3qN

@BeepsMan @BBCRadio4 No, but it goes up on @BBCiPlayerRadio for a bit as soon as it’s broadcast - but that won’t be until the end of the year or early 2019.
@aus99a @BBCRadio4 Not sure. I’m not aware of its being broadcast on any radio stations there. You can buy old episodes here - https://t.co/ZXwPT4LPxl - which I assume works internationally, but it’s a bit expensive, I’m afraid.

@Howard_Goodall @RevRichardColes @hamchick @MrsNickleby @NCSOxford I genuinely don't think I've ever received higher praise! Thank you! But most of the credit has to go to AFB himself, of course.
@RevRichardColes @hamchick @MrsNickleby @NCSOxford That's absolutely right. The choir's musical reputation would not have survived my involvement.
Thanks for all the nice messages about episode 1 of #UpstartCrow series 3. It’s now on iPlayer (see below) together with all of the first two series and the 2017 Christmas Special. Episode 2 is on Wednesday at 8.30pm on @BBCTwo. https://t.co/0jg9YHuDgW
@MrHolness @MrJamesBachman @jondrytay Always.
@MrJamesBachman @MrHolness @jondrytay I’m seriously considering asking if they’ll cash a cheque.
Well, nobody’s perfect. https://t.co/SdGDXVjwTu
If you were hoping I’d remind you when the new series of #UpstartCrow starts, you’re in luck! IT’S IN FIVE MINUTES’ TIME! On @BBCTwo.
@MrHolness @MrJamesBachman @jondrytay I’ll gladly lend you a pint, Matt, as long as you pay me back in a hipster craft IPA from Seattle. And a jug of spritzer for James?
@soopolallie @BBCTwo That’s what it feels like trying to remember the lines.
@t3yrn You’re welcome!
@MrJamesBachman I think that must be the work of my origamist namesake: https://t.co/8prarYICRS
@JazzyJaney @TimDownie1 @garethmammal @robrouse Brilliant work! A Bayeux tapestry of sitcom.
@jabberwocky43 @BBCTwo Yes, we’re shooting one next year.
@Dee093Denise @BBCTwo Thank you! And yes there will.
Here’s another clip from episode 1 of the third series of #UpstartCrow, which PREMIERES TONIGHT at 8.30pm on @BBCTwo. https://t.co/IZvTpjjJdv
Upstart Crow series 3 starts TOMORROW EVENING at 8.30pm on ⁦@BBCTwo⁩. In the meantime, please enjoy this clip, with my compliments. #UpstartCrow https://t.co/bAR8FjIsFU
@QbZ20 @ObsNewReview @BBCTwo You’ve asked two questions and the second is too complicated for me. My answer to the first is yes.
@Steve_Labourne @ObsNewReview @BBCTwo You’re only half right, I’m afraid.
@AliQuack No.
Ben Elton is, by the way, as well as being a truly brilliant man, EXTREMELY good fun to talk to.
Instead of writing a column in ⁦@ObsNewReview⁩ this week, I’ve interviewed Ben Elton, and been interviewed by him, about the new series of #UpstartCrow (which starts on Wednesday, 8.30pm, ⁦@BBCTwo⁩). https://t.co/ZPGuqrjS5W
@stephenmorana That’s very nice to hear!
See below! Starts in 26 minutes. #UpstartCrow https://t.co/e2ZqhBOkHB
@stephenmorana Yes, that’s me in the panda suit.
Just a week to go until the third series of #UpstartCrow starts on ⁦@BBCTwo⁩! Episode 1 is on at 8.30pm on 29th August. Here’s a trailer: https://t.co/icjuqfjDEI
@rogerpovey Thank you! Very kind of you to say. And I’m glad you liked the show.
@__DMoore_ On reflection, I think you’re probably right.
There’s a picture of me on the front page of the Times! Ahead of all the rich foreign criminals the UK is failing to tackle! And I bet some of them look AMAZING. #UpstartCrow https://t.co/PssLVUELaG
@tom_monty31 Thank you!
@SnapperHarrison Very much worth it - great photo, thanks so much. You’ve even made the breakfast look nicer than in real life.
Upstart Crow series 3 starts on Weds 29th August at 8.30pm on @BBCTwo. But, in the meantime, the ENTIRE FIRST TWO SERIES plus the Christmas Special STARRING EMMA THOMPSON are currently on BBC iPlayer, so you can watch them NOW (link below). #UpstartCrow https://t.co/cVs2wi4iG0
@DavidMuttering Splendid work.
Getting your exam results today? Here's some relentless negativity from an establishment figure. #alevelresults2018 #UpstartCrow https://t.co/HdSVptfNqN
My wife doesn’t take any shit. https://t.co/Z5kWT7whNR
Saw @thefestivaluk last night. It is a very funny film, all the way through. That is an extremely rare thing. I highly recommend it.
@RusticR @tvaudience @BBCRadio4 @ShawTheatreLdn I’m very glad to hear that. It seems lying can sometimes do some good!
@OJStreets @bbccomedy To be fair to Ben Elton, Kate (played by @WhelanGemma) makes that very point in this episode, just after the end of the clip.
To mark the start of the Edinburgh Fringe, my Observer column today contains some moaning about the Edinburgh Fringe. https://t.co/e2uo6jNvnc
@TimoFish I’m glad to say it isn’t - we’re shooting series 2 in the new year.
@CharlzeyBell @BBCOne @LeeMack @RobBrydon We’ve recorded a new series - should be on soon.
@DiazBenjedi @guardian Thank you!
@facebookloather It’s looking like end of August or early September, but the precise date is still unconfirmed.
@StephenJMayo Thanks!
@SteveMawds Both sides have certainly done it but I really believe that the Tories are the worst offenders here. They called the referendum and it’s their party’s internal divide which has caused most of this.
Sounds like a career plan for a 1970s celebrity. https://t.co/jZlY5KGO10
@garethmammal Thanks!
My Observer column today is about how Tory politicians will soon have to stop doing that thing they love doing more than anything else. https://t.co/dn1vC5GTuX
@goonerwriter @RobBrydon @WILTY_TV There is! We recorded a new series recently and it should be going out this autumn.
@GrumpyOldRick @RobBrydon You’re too kind!
Why do people keep comparing Love Island with Oxbridge? It’s like comparing the Eurovision Song Contest with getting an ISA. https://t.co/x7qwpfmjnp
Announcement: @RobBrydon, Lee Mack and I are doing a live show! In September 2019! You can buy tickets NOW, though there’s a tiny but statistically significant chance one or more of us will be dead by then. https://t.co/75hnugRNqX https://t.co/CTYmez7EZb
@WehWillehWinkeh No, not me. Must be one of the other ones.
@highbank1 @arobertwebb @jessearmstrong1 @sambaintv Thank you! Extremely nice of you to say. Very glad you liked it.
My Observer⁩ column today asks whether names really matter when you’re being tugged off into a harbour. https://t.co/l7lw1PZSSl
@ChasquiPenguin @JazzyJaney Thanks - much appreciated.
@FlashheartFave @TimDownie1 Thanks! Enjoy the ale and pie!
@TrevorCoultMC Thank you!
@presentoccupant Gerald Ford AND the French Revolution! I’m in good company.
@Loupot729 @JazzyJaney Thanks!
@TheTjoconnor Happy Birthday! Have a lovely day.
@natalieissofab Thank you - interesting gif.

I knew there was something I didn’t like about him. @sambaintv @jessearmstrong1 https://t.co/bSdLA4ZLpc
@JazzyJaney Thank you! And that’s a great poster. It looks like Star Wars in a pub.
Just got out of a cold shower and found myself singing the phrase “I’m briefly not too hot” to the tune of “Where did you get that hat”.
@barnyboatman @ObsNewReview That day will come.
@sandbergrlaw Thank you!
To those tweeters who tell me to “stick to comedy”: please do not read my Observer/⁦@ObsNewReview⁩ column. I have not stuck to it. I have become unstuck from it, and have fallen onto the floor of mirthless opinion. https://t.co/laHJByuO1f
@RLChinaNW @RobRLFC Thank you!
@DavidDa06474541 Yes, when Labour next get into power I will indeed remember that there will be another election within five years giving voters the chance to reverse that decision.
@LEGOWorldsGame Thank you - I appreciate the apology and your having taken it down. Yes, if you’d credited it, I wouldn’t’ve minded it at all.
@keiththecamel Quite!
@WiganGolfer Yeah, but they can achieve that more straightforwardly by just not inviting him on the programme.
@jessearmstrong1 @kyle_h1214 @arobertwebb @C0stumeDesigner @nevin_june @sambaintv I’ve just taken it off and photographed the only writing there is on it. I think “Debenhams” must be a very obscure Korean designer, working mainly in polymers. https://t.co/kfMDtRYQIy

@theGireesh Hear hear. From now on everything that goes wrong is officially somebody else’s fault.
@YonSolitary @adnansarwar Thanks - you’re too kind! But very glad you like our shows. And it was terrific to meet you, Adnan. And I consider that video amongst my finest broadcasting work!
I’ve signed ANOTHER petition today, but this one’s a bit less controversial. It’s been set up by my friend ⁦@thefridgeman⁩ in an attempt to get more kids into playing tennis. Have a look and sign if you agree. https://t.co/rz9wcfPDQO
I have just signed this petition which is requesting a public vote on the final Brexit deal. I mean, I don’t expect we’ll get one, but there’s no harm in asking. If you’re worried about Brexit, why not sign and then you’ll feel you’ve done something. https://t.co/WkSPKG6LeX
My Observer/⁦@ObsNewReview⁩ column today is about the odd/intriguing/infuriating/misanthropy-inducing fact that, while lots of people like expensive things, some like them purely because they are expensive. https://t.co/LFyzfat63t
@Joseph_T_Kirk Thank you - what excellent children! Glad to hear they’re into Radio 4. Very nice to meet you too.
@iamfinlay @rufusjones1 @arobertwebb Oh yes, there’s a face perfectly formed for a French inhale.
@JeremyMakely @ObsNewReview It’s one step away from a massage chair.
@PGPowell @DrMatthewSweet Yes, I was brought up to dread swallowing toothpaste lather, but I wasn’t told lies about ice cream vans.

@grinningmanfilm We’ve actually now shot 3 series in total. The third one will be broadcast later this year.
@MakeJills Thanks!
@JazzyJaney Nothing over the summer, I don’t think. We’ll be doing more Unbelievable Truths in September.
@LPhillipLucas @AnimalsAus @david_mitchell Don’t worry - happens all the time.
@LPhillipLucas @AnimalsAus Let me gently direct you towards @david_mitchell. He’s the writer you mean.

@AnjaAltenburg @JimHowick @Isysuttie Fine by me.
@LauraBedrossian @arobertwebb Very glad you like it!
@JessEclair_ Not really. I did GCSE German, so I understand it a bit.
@gamer_geekhaha @arobertwebb Yes there is.
@31ltolox @arobertwebb That’s very nice - thanks for passing it on!
@bblace @ThomasJGray @ObsNewReview Thank you both for sharing that.
@guywalters @ObsNewReview Thanks very much, Guy - nice of you to say.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today exhorts people to live in the moment rather than view everything through the lens of their irritation at other people’s cameraphones. https://t.co/Vbc6y3x0Rc
@Mrfrye88 Yes!
@russellcrowe Well that means an awful lot, obviously. It’s just really made my day, thank you so much.
@russellcrowe Thank you! I'm extremely pleased you enjoyed it - very nice of you to say.
@Al_Leppo88 You’re welcome! Very glad it helped.
@ccbaxter @arobertwebb Thanks!
@jdawn1982 I’m very flattered by that comparison.
@emmafreud Of course! Have done so.
@Laura882882 Thanks!
Why not round off the weekend by being lied to by the MSM? The last episode of the current series of The Unbelievable Truth is on at 6.30pm @BBCRadio4. https://t.co/jSnjrQL3FG
If you were enjoying a picture of an anteater, would you mind if it was dead? My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today tries to answer this eternal question. https://t.co/sdQfNktbdh
@JazzyJaney @WILTY_TV @RobBrydon Thanks - that’s great. Though I notice you’ve reversed the height order.
Whoops! Forgot to tweet today’s episode of “The Unbelievable Truth”. Details below, including an iPlayer link which, thanks to my tardiness, now works. https://t.co/6m4EqoV8cx
We’re recording a new series of @WILTY_TV in May and free tickets to watch a recording are available here: https://t.co/FCghNXWWHz

@c_wickham We’ll be doing some more in the next couple of months.
@JazzyJaney Not yet, but we don’t film Back till the end of the year so I think another broadcast clash is unlikely!
@Rich_Y_ There are loads of us, real and otherwise. The novelist is @david_mitchell.
@MTR_conal Thank you! And yes there will. We’ve already recorded it, in fact.
Of tonight’s Unbelievable Truth line-up, only the lone millennial has the confidence to eschew social media. It’s on at 6.30pm on @BBCRadio4. https://t.co/UmozHE4BDn
@BastCity @Gewgs I’m pretty sure Jesus sounded exactly like me. That’s certainly how I’ve always imagined him.
@tim_neale @Jackson_Boxer None taken - I was glad to read it.
@tim_neale @ObsNewReview @Jackson_Boxer Thanks - I enjoyed reading that. But I wouldn’t describe it as a counter. We’re making pretty much the same point.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about getting ripped off in restaurants. https://t.co/aENjOv2zTm
@igblan @UnbelieveTruth @alandavies1 @elisjames @richardosman @sindhuvfunny @BBCRadio4 It’s a way of taking longer to say ‘new’, thus making it more noticeable.
Today’s brand new episode of The Unbelievable Truth (@UnbelieveTruth) features the vocalised thoughts of @alandavies1, @elisjames, @richardosman &amp; @sindhuvfunny. It’s on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm.
@Nukapai Thanks for your rude tweet. I think that’s pretty much the OPPOSITE of what I’m saying, but I do suggest that perfumes that don’t smell of anything are a con, and I notice you’re involved in the perfume industry, so perhaps that’s why you’re so irritated.
In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today: why the emperor’s new clothes might be a better buy than an unscented perfume. https://t.co/PcEsbg2p8t
@artisIong Weirdly, that’s exactly how it felt.
@markiepants Unless you mean origamist, I don’t know. If you do mean origamist, it’s someone who does origami, the art of paper folding.
@_JonEvans1 Thank you - glad you liked it.
A brand new series of @UnbelieveTruth starts tonight at 6.30pm on @BBCRadio4, and features noises from @JohnFinnemore, @henningwehn, @LouSanders and @GraemeGarden1.
@JohnMur61099878 Thank you!
@EmmaWasp1 That specifically says that antisemitism is racism.
@EmmaWasp1 I can’t explain why you’re asking that question, because antisemitism obviously IS racism and I neither think nor have ever written anything to the contrary.
According to some spam I just got from Amazon, my opinion matters! So I reckon that means everyone ought to read my Observer column. https://t.co/KBSnpVTn2q
@IanSanders @prodnose It’s missing the thick ‘80s glasses.
@davidczu Thanks!
@KJTweetster Thank you!
@CyDoesHybrid @arobertwebb The idea is that it makes people unable to stop themselves saying embarrassing or shameful truths about themselves.
@foozzzball @wocado @david_mitchell I almost always finish reading the books I start - and I seldom (that’s not to say never) regret it.
@julia_politics @ObsNewReview I’m not on Facebook, and I’ve never been further from regretting it.
@gavinlenaghan Glad it struck a chord with you.
@taoofthedude @arobertwebb @sundance_now Yes there is!
@wocado I think that was @david_mitchell actually.
@iamkev_1981 Thanks!
@5coop5 @NetflixUK @arobertwebb Thank you! We’re very proud of that show.
@quantum_monk @Flaminhaystack That may be their technique but it surely isn’t their ultimate aim.
@SimonDoubleday That’s an extremely flattering comparison!
@SimonDoubleday Well now I’m doubly grateful! Very glad it made you laugh.
@SimonDoubleday Thanks!
I’m back in the Observer/@ObsNewReview today with a column. If you ignore it, you’re already taking its advice. https://t.co/HukXa8CIN5

There’s a compilation of previously unseen bits from the recent series of @WILTY_TV on @BBCOne at 8.30pm tonight. So there.
@shinysiany Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@blueisaac1 Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it.
The last brand new @WILTY_TV of the series is on @BBCOne tonight at 9pm. https://t.co/6xoXdFSIjH
There’s a brand new “Would I Lie To You?” on @BBCOne tonight. They’ve put it on at the unusually late time of 9pm, which means we all avoided swearing for no reason. https://t.co/6bfE7JpEG5
@PhiIIipBlackman Thanks!
@dbtelford That’s the back story! Now it makes sense.
@Quadras_Music Of course! Come to think of it, maybe it’s not a depiction of a real event at all.
@EditorNelson Perhaps it’s making a satirical point about how planning laws get bent or ignored in the face of corporate financial might.
@paulkerensa Of course!
@cbetta Possibly - but, if so, it’s not much of a claim for the car deal: just about diverting enough to grab the attention of someone absolutely determined to procrastinate.
Nice to see this terrible advert again. A few questions: 1) Why not just let her read it? It’ll only take a second. 2) How come she’s so incredibly strong? 3) Why do the bridesmaids give so much of a shit? Is it a forced marriage and they’re in the pay of the bride’s father? https://t.co/ZgKxCVLNdF
@MarcMiller33 There will be. We start shooting this month.
@landladycheryl @richardosman @alandavies1 @sindhuvfunny @elisjames Thanks - glad you enjoyed the show.
@Lauraminnow Except nowadays the panellists wouldn’t take the programme’s word for which story wasn’t fake.

This brand new episode of @WILTY_TV (which is on @BBCOne today at 8.30pm) is NOT a Christmas Special - that was last week. It is a Non-Christmas Normal. Please don’t think us unfestive - it was July. https://t.co/FjH9tKfv2K
@emmathehud Thank you!
@wrapandwings I do indeed! But how do you know the sleep deprivation isn’t making you imagine this tweet?

Thanks for all the nice tweets about the #UpstartCrow Christmas Special, featuring the brilliant Emma Thompson. It’s now on @BBCiPlayer if you’re in the mood for wassailing. https://t.co/QgjZBAUZfd
Happy Christmas everyone! If you’re looking for some festive TV later today, then I promise you that the Upstart Crow Christmas Special (8.25pm @BBCTwo) is EXTREMELY Christmassy and, on top of that, stars Emma Thompson. https://t.co/Ka7MK7ff0f

@JazzyJaney Thanks so much for the Christmas parcel, particularly the brilliant Christmas Crow embroidery. Very kind of you.
I’m very pleased to announce that the Christmas Special of #UpstartCrow, which stars EMMA THOMPSON (I make no apology for those capitals), is going to be on @BBCTwo at 8.25pm on CHRISTMAS DAY (I’m equally unashamed of those)! https://t.co/n7SkKwOpYQ
@AFathenhiem Thanks for the nice compliments - and happy birthday for later in the month.
Here’s a clip from tonight’s brand new episode of Would I Lie To You? (@WILTY_TV), which is on @BBCOne at 8.30pm and features @Melvinodoom, @FayRipley, @JamesAcaster and @GabbyLogan. https://t.co/kqQG08wd5h

@Scott1984_FP @All4 @O2 @Telefonica Glad you’re enjoying it. It’s actually written by @simonblackwell.
@melvynadam Glad you liked it - and, yes, I’ll try and get through to them about that confusion.
Really?! The POLICE are using it now? Or is that also a joke? https://t.co/jvfIdUwpeC
Yes it’s fake. It’s from a comedy book that @arobertwebb and I wrote in 2009. cc @FergalOBrienTV3 https://t.co/Xsrtqheizs
@MandatheHut I am indeed! Hope you’re enjoying it.
See below for details of tonight’s brand new episode of @WILTY_TV. And, just to reiterate, you really MUST cancel your plans - unless you’ve got some sort of video recorder, a computer that’s less than 10 years old or don’t want to watch it. https://t.co/xkKExZcJGl
@jamespgwarner Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@Troyyyyyyyyy That’s a handsome apology! And really, don’t worry about it: if there’s no legitimate way of watching it where you are, then I reckon it’s fair enough to bend the rules. I’m glad you got to see it and I hope you laughed.
@tudahheretic @ObsNewReview I chose it.
@JazzyJaney Yes indeed - I now think I’ll be doing the first of the two recordings.
@tudahheretic @ObsNewReview I write a weekly column for the Observer which is the Guardian’s sister paper and so goes up on its website. This was just last week’s column. https://t.co/PzNG408FD7

@ArtHouse43 @JazzyJaney Oh no it’s not like that! Actually turns out they HAVE asked me but we’re not sure if the dates work. Hopefully they will. (Also my wife says Grease 2 is a great film.)
@JazzyJaney They haven’t approached me yet, so I don’t think so.
@tomroach @arobertwebb Will do so. Good luck with it.
@Scottie1975 Exactly.
@durhamgbrown That’s extremely nice of you to say! You’re clearly very talented, that looks to me like a brilliant and dynamic painting (of my weird face).
@durhamgbrown That’s genuinely brilliant - good luck with the next one.

@DoggiePeace @bigtalk @arobertwebb @simonblackwell That’s EXTREMELY kind.
Just to say, I saw @TheRetreatPlay by @sambaintv @ParkTheatre the other night and it is both hilariously funny and an insightful discussion of the whole point of being alive. Also, unlike this new sort of tweet, it is not too long.

@davepoflynn Look at the right wheel of the left van: there’s a thin white line beside it. Then look at the right wheel on the other van.
@SarahO_Connell Yes, I think real life doesn’t have to be as funny to make us laugh as fiction. Once fake, it’s up against The Importance of Being Earnest.
Noticing that this has been photoshopped totally stops it amusing me and I’m not quite sure why. https://t.co/vPEhnoyG6J
@JennieHughes60 @guardian The car thrashing? No, that’s definitely Fawlty Towers - the episode is called Gourmet Night. https://t.co/wQKS4uyi3g
In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today: if Frank Spencer had been more litigious. https://t.co/WQikOSIami
@nicko236 @arobertwebb I’m afraid there are only 3 episodes, but we were proud of it. Hope you like it.
I’m on #QI tonight (10pm @BBCTwo) &amp; #QIXL tomorrow (ditto), so I’m tweeting my first ever gif, showing who’s on and what we’re discussing. https://t.co/zIeI6lsj9c
The final piece of the jigsaw. https://t.co/zvPjO7LanM
@jrgarries @ABCTV Thanks, I’m very glad.
As is so often the case, the true situation turns out to be slightly more nuanced... https://t.co/pFNnkOHtv2
If my time zone calculations are correct, episode 2 of “Back” is on ABC1 in Australia in 2 hours’ time. Hope @ABCTV viewers enjoy it.
@Dman963 @arobertwebb Splendid!
@PeterSLucas @BBCRadio4 That’s what they WANT you to do.
@_frankenfruity @BBCRadio4 I do that all the time but it leaves me cold.
Here is an attempt to tell you today’s Unbelievable Truth topics using emojis instead of words. What a time to be alive. 6.30pm, @BBCRadio4. https://t.co/47t5KH3I4S
My Observer column today is actually quite a high-brow discussion of the role of gastric wind in art. #parp https://t.co/Z7CjAFxxqs
@RobertBathurst @TimDownie1 @BBCiPlayer Really?! That would be nice!
@FintanOHiggins @ABCTV @ABCiview You’re right - sorry.
@MrJamesBachman Starters are better than puddings is the premise for my liking salad more than fruit, I think.
Sorry for failing to tweet before the Southern Hemisphere premier of Back on @ABCTV yesterday, but I believe ep 1 is now on @ABCiview.
@CarrieWalker Thank you! That’s really great to hear.
@MrJamesBachman Yes it’s a duty eat, unless it’s smothered with dressing or packed with cheese. But I prefer it to most fruit.
@Owen_J_S I’d ask @david_mitchell rather than me.
@keeleytweet You did!
@samjohnson77 Hope so.
@VonBlade @BBCRadio4 I actually don’t know the answer to that, though I’ve occasionally wondered myself. I’ll ask the producer next time I see him.
Love baffling mixtures of truth and lies, but tired of the internet? Then tune in to @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm today! https://t.co/bYpzFqlSMc
@kat3mat3 Quite right. Apologies. Hopefully the targeted advertising was soothing though.
@janinegibson Thanks! Glad you liked it.
In my Observer column today: has humankind finally had enough of trying to work out what’s real? https://t.co/COgdUXwHgO
@louisecoatz @jondrytay @VictoriaCoren I have literally just told you what the lie is. Try reading my earlier tweet again. I'm going out now and won't be replying again.
@louisecoatz @jondrytay @VictoriaCoren She doesn't believe that &amp; has never said it. It's a horrible lie to tell about someone. Why don't you retract it, shut up &amp; leave her alone
@louisecoatz @jondrytay @VictoriaCoren You said she "believes Roman Polanski should not be imprisoned for drugging and anally raping a 13 year old child". That is a lie.
@HVShisoFarm Thank you! And, yes, we really hope to make more.
This show has a terrific writing team behind it. Do give it a try if you seek to be amused. https://t.co/iBBITEGFGu
@MaryRoseMuseum I was watching it at school. I think it was the first time they brought a TV into the classroom.
@Mahaloth We’ve recorded a new series, but I don’t think they’ve decided on a broadcast date yet.
@ProfGSheffield @WhelanGemma Thanks Gary! Very nice of you to say.
Starting in two minutes... #UpstartCrow https://t.co/pRQoWRp1K5
Starts in 19 minutes on @BBCRadio4... https://t.co/yyM1MPRKKh
@simonblackwell @waynecater1 Hear hear. It was great working with you.
It’s the LAST EPISODE of the series of #UpstartCrow tonight at 8.30pm on @BBCTwo. Here’s a clip. https://t.co/EGfomuR6sV
@Simurgh83 @gerontophile Of course!
@GarryVaux @arobertwebb I'm afraid not.
@jondrytay @BarbaraHockaday An excellent name indeed! Thanks Barbara - very glad you liked the article.
@gerontophile It's a link to my weekly column which is attempting, within 140 characters, to give a sense of what it's about.
I'd have been quite happy to be told what religion I was and then left to get on with other things. In the Observer: https://t.co/mF60BRBXO1
So rare to see a picture of the Queen and Leonard Rossiter together. https://t.co/juNPZsT6q4
@JazzyJaney Yes and no. The inside is a set in a studio. The outside is a real pub, but it's called something else.
@Dasto_Says @bigtalk @arobertwebb It's going to stream on @sundance_now from November 2nd, then air on @SundanceTV.
@tyIerrjo Not confirmed yet, but I hope so.
@JazzyJaney @simonblackwell @arobertwebb @Geoff_McGivern Thanks! And thanks so much for the support.
@TVSanjeev @Channel4 @simonblackwell @arobertwebb @louisebrealey Thanks so much! That's incredibly nice to hear.
@tempdata100 @Channel4 Obviously.
@Cantlosehope It's going to stream on @sundance_now from November 2nd, then air on @SundanceTV.
@onanotherday I hope so.
@CravenHeifer70 Just thinking about pizza.
@Dawny_Zimbler They're all here: https://t.co/PTPSwOS27C .
@KenPlume I can only apologise for the minute quantities in which we make television.
@Bradley1976 Thank you!
Thanks for all the nice tweets about #BackC4 - glad you enjoyed it. For those who asked about a 2nd series: we certainly hope to make one.
The last episode of the series of #BackC4 is on @Channel4 in 25 minutes. This tweet will shortly become inaccurate.
@ClaireFish2 @BBCTwo Yes, I think so!
@WastingOurYouth Don't know exactly but we've recorded a new series so it should be relatively soon.
Here's a trailer for the last episode of the series of #BackC4 (@Channel4, 10pm tonight). Episodes 1-5 are here: https://t.co/PTPSwOS27C https://t.co/SS49HS1Op9
If you love shrew taming, you'll be disappointed by tonight's #UpstartCrow (@BBCTwo, 8.30pm) because no shrew actually gets tamed.
It's not ALL about Kanye West. But it's undeniable that some of it is about Kanye West. @BBCRadio4 https://t.co/50JBJFAzGr
Here's a clip from tonight's episode of #UpstartCrow, which is on @BBCTwo at 8.30pm. https://t.co/vWwxrquZ4L
@F_Brickwood I'm confused. Do you think I GENUINELY want to reopen Bedlam to tourists? So do you also think I want to decriminalise child prostitution?
@Badsox57 You haven't read the article, have you?
In my Observer column today: there was something about Theresa May's disastrous speech that really got me down. https://t.co/8kc3yn57xO
@garethhargrave Yes I did - and thank you!
@RealMattKing @arobertwebb Thanks Matt - that's lovely to see. Good times indeed.
That man is INCREDIBLY strong. https://t.co/WM5zsWPRXt
@laurenfrench Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
Slightly disturbing... https://t.co/WsDs2JCF3v
@LeoJCarey The May speech? I just watched the highlights. The mishaps per minute rate is otherwise a bit low.
@ArtyBagger Thanks! Really glad you like it.
@LeoJCarey @arobertwebb Thanks Leo - very glad you liked it. Hope all's good with you.
It starts in half an hour. #BackC4 https://t.co/fOrTi32deg
The penultimate episode of the series is on tonight at 10pm on @Channel4. #BackC4 https://t.co/0YjB3n7nqm
@benleet @UtPcom It was a pleasure. And thanks for sticking up for older spenders!
Episode 4 of series 2 of #UpstartCrow starts on @BBCTwo imminently. 8.30pm to be precise. https://t.co/A6yjV6iWfz

@fax_me @sambaintv @arobertwebb @jessearmstrong1 Happy birthday! I sense I might be about to sit on a burglar.
@ws1564 That's very kind - but it's Ben Elton who deserves the credit.
@simonblackwell @tghelani @Geoff_McGivern @arobertwebb Thank you! Really glad you liked it.
@bigmadandy Just done so. Hope all's good with you.
@Baddiel @simonblackwell Thanks David - that's one of my favourite lines.
I don't understand anything. https://t.co/dDhgQeZiYp
@wcg5003 I certainly shall (consider it). Glad you like them.

@CarrieStLCards I don't really understand myself.
@ScottQuinnell Thanks Scott!
Here's another clip from tonight's episode of #UpstartCrow. It's on @BBCTwo at 8.30pm and on the internet NOW. https://t.co/8yf0nvec36

In my Observer column today: I love the theatre but I don't mind people saying the seats could be comfier. https://t.co/MHjaVBvEim
@Dawnf1 @davidsoho1 @observer @ObsNewReview Over to you, @ObsNewReview.
@Dawnf1 @davidsoho1 @observer It's that I don't review things and I don't decide or influence in any way what @ObsNewReview reviews. Also @observer is a New York paper.
@mizzgemz83 @davidsoho1 @observer I'm sure the show's great but 1) I don't review anything, 2) I have no input into what my paper reviews &amp; 3) that's not its Twitter feed.
@JaneCWoods Thank you!
Here's a great clip from Monday's ep of #UpstartCrow (8.30 @BBCTwo) featuring @TimDownie1, @WhelanGemma &amp; @robrouse. https://t.co/977hhFwmhT
@SachaBonesetter @Channel4 Sorry - everything gets put on at once.
Here's a clip from tonight's #BackC4 (on @Channel4, at 10pm). You can catch up with the first 2 episodes here: https://t.co/PTPSwOS27C https://t.co/QyZdUbPIa6
Nice! (As @JohnnyThomson2 would say.) https://t.co/QQO5PJZI5b
@murray_mint5 @BBCTwo Thank you!
@amanda_vegas That's terrific.
@sambaintv @arobertwebb @jessearmstrong1 HPSD to you too!
Only 19 minutes to wait until episode 2 of this series of #UpstartCrow on @BBCTwo! (Or 0 minutes if you don't ignore the internet.)
Here's another clip from tonight's #UpstartCrow (8.30, @BBCTwo), which sees the return of Burbage, Condell &amp; Kempe. https://t.co/QthogovLtW
In today's Observer I address one of the eternal questions: how do you feel about new versions of existing products? https://t.co/0oK3Ae5DAE
@JmsCblt @arobertwebb You don't mean that.
@chris_emerson Hope you like them. Sorry they weren't more spread out over the year.
@PaulMarsden @BBCTwo Thank you - that's great to hear.
@tomstephens_ They were great, weren't they? It almost makes me feel guilty that I've never bought either product.
@Safetyconundrum @VictoriaCoren Yes I did.
Here's a clip from Monday's episode of Upstart Crow (@BBCTwo at 8.30pm, but also already online because of science). https://t.co/TQcvKGXExR
@rufusjones1 @arobertwebb Thanks Rufus! Hope all's well with you.
@karen090465 Thanks- very glad you liked it.
@MrDavidLane @simonblackwell @robertwebb Thank you!
@sarahezekiel Yes, @robertshaw showed me round. There were some beautiful pictures. It's a great achievement - congratulations.
@JazzyJaney Thanks so much for the brilliant #BackC4 embroidery. Very kind of you.
If you're passing the Tabernacle in Notting Hill, this is well worth a look. https://t.co/egWOPMV0ZF
@Baddiel @simonblackwell That's the problem with HD. Very glad you liked it.
@richardosman Thanks Richard - very nice of you to say.
Episode 2 of #BackC4, written by the brilliant @simonblackwell, is on shortly - at 10pm on @Channel4. Hope you like it.
@TimDownie1 Thanks Tim!
Here's a trailer for episode 2 of #BackC4, which is on @Channel4 at 10pm tonight. https://t.co/wrUeWyLcwx
@MaxPlainview @arobertwebb Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed them.
@lizsmith_1707 Here - https://t.co/CS5lxQMrJm -   but it involves money.
@AndyGorfman @qikipedia I feel I should point out that I didn't say that - must be another David Mitchell.
@LFC__Redman8 Thank you! And yes, Ben really is a brilliant writer.
@slepkane @garethmammal Thanks Simon! Very pleased you like it.
Thanks for the nice tweets about #UpstartCrow. If you're modern, you can watch the whole 2nd series now on iPlayer. https://t.co/bMXjgAVfaU
@Geoff_McGivern Thanks Geoff!
Quite right! The shame of it. https://t.co/8nh8xDbKvI
This is going to happen in about 25 minutes time. Hope you like it. #UpstartCrow https://t.co/EzreR3zsQe
@nksprzak @MissFlowerPixie @BBCTwo That's good to know - thanks.
@jenhatte @TimDownie1 @BBCTwo They never listen to me.
@dee2761 @TimDownie1 @BBCTwo Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@MissFlowerPixie @BBCTwo I'm not sure, I'm afraid. You can buy a DVD but I don't think it's on iPlayer at the moment.
@ChorizPao I've never said that. Must be another David Mitchell.
@AgeWait Thanks! Really hope you enjoy it.
@Yehcontcheh @TimDownie1 @BBCTwo Meanwhile, you're making me doubt mine.
@druzer555 Very possibly.
@RobCooke1 I didn't have time to do it really. Might try and bring it back at some point though. Glad you liked it.
@bbccomedy It's pre-standardised spelling, so I think you can do what you like. Throw a few more 'k's in maybe. Also, it doesn't exist.
Yes, @TimDownie1 and I are the bikeless Hairy Bikers of the Sixteenth Century! Upstart Crow series 2 starts tonight at 8.30pm on @BBCTwo. https://t.co/n4vhSDDcsE
@robthor @sambaintv @Breathwick @BBCTwo I've actually been doing Donald Trump's recently. I think I've really got his voice.
@robthor @Breathwick @BBCTwo Also, Katie's had 4 'o's.
@robthor @Breathwick @BBCTwo Excellent! Hope you're all very well and had a lovely summer.
@Breathwick @robthor @BBCTwo Thanks Katie! I should have known it was you from the Wahoooo!
Here's a little preview of the 1st episode of Upstart Crow series 2, which is on tomorrow night at 8.30 on @BBCTwo. https://t.co/kPom1WkmMg

@KenPlume @RufusHound @arobertwebb @simonblackwell Hi Ken! Hope all's good with you (considering, you know, the world).
Thanks! But credit must go to @simonblackwell and @Geoff_McGivern. https://t.co/PFCtvJgmK6
@dalgleish_s Well that does sound extreme. Sorry about that.
@_Dinkely_ Nice.
@lizmaybrice @arobertwebb @MrHolness Thanks Liz!
@Tonygardner @Cparks1976 @simonblackwell Thanks Tony - and for your brilliant cameo.
@RufusHound @simonblackwell @arobertwebb Thanks Rufus! Very glad you liked it.
@dalgleish_s I suspect that's because it's the adverts that pay for the programmes. Sorry if that comes as a nasty surprise.
@euanferg Oh good! Not-execrable is very  much what we were going for.
@Squttnbear @Channel4 @arobertwebb I believe it starts streaming on @sundance_now on November 2nd, then will air on @SundanceTV.
@Baddiel @simonblackwell @arobertwebb Thanks David - very nice of you to say. Glad you enjoyed it.
@jondrytay @simonblackwell @arobertwebb @MrHolness @Geoff_McGivern Oh good! And that should have read "nice of you to say". Apologies.
Thanks so much for all the nice tweets about #BackC4. If you missed it undeliberately, here it is on the internet. https://t.co/PTPSwOS27C
@jondrytay @simonblackwell @arobertwebb @MrHolness @Geoff_McGivern Thanks Jon! Very nice if you say - glad you enjoyed it.
Thanks Richard! Very glad you liked it. https://t.co/4jpH4JD7oH
30 mins till the 1st episode of #BackC4 on @Channel4, with @arobertwebb &amp; me, written by @simonblackwell. So just time to do various things.
@samhaysom @arobertwebb Thanks - glad you liked it.
@simonblackwell @Caius_LM @arobertwebb @Bazzie05 @luckyn_6 @lucky4malone Hear hear!
This trail for #BackC4 (on tonight) has a few tiny plot spoilers but, like any appetiser, it must contain some food. https://t.co/oy1hkePDDr
@brucedes Mm yes... Plus Back and Crow being on at same time of year is an interesting decision by someone. Ah well. Really hope you like Crow too.
@BradSabbath @arobertwebb It starts tomorrow at 10pm on @Channel4.
Thank you, @brucedes! Very glad you liked it. https://t.co/JPRL4WqdTK
@WhatTheBearSays Thanks! Glad you like the show.
Here's another little clip from #BackC4 which starts on Wednesday at 10pm on @Channel4. https://t.co/skiRN3v9nt
@rob_garnham Yes, later in the year.
My Observer column today is about the most fraught &amp; momentous issue facing humanity. Unless I've missed something. https://t.co/xZ16RRTKQG

@MichaelOldroyd Thanks - glad he enjoyed it. It was fun to record.
@smbelsare Thank you! Very glad you liked it.
@GeorgeWoodger I have two problems with that: 1) I didn't write Peep Show and 2) That bald lady is wearing an AMAZING bluey-grey muumuu.
@BoardofDarkness Hundreds of millions.
@NeilBarnes1 Great working with you too. Here's to series 2! (Of either.)
@Promethea9 Thank you!
My Observer column today is about Britain's fuel crisis - by which I mean our functional approach to food. https://t.co/IVzuFXQLBG
But who's that old man staring at Henri Matisse? https://t.co/yhCNwY1eD8
@AdrianCanadrian It's a subheading.
@Outlaw_Nerd Thanks - very glad you enjoyed it.
@slepkane Thanks Simon!
@Michael_42 It certainly is.
This, by the way, is not what the column says or what I think. It's almost the opposite. The standfirst (subheading) is not written by me. https://t.co/m7bALzUL2B
I'm back in the Observer this week with a column about advertising, which this tweet is advertising. https://t.co/NgbYvRImPe

@biglogger @VictoriaCoren To answer your points: 1) not scandalous, thick; 2) playing tennis not a profession, just a job; 3) it is pointless so, yes, fine to say so.
@AnIndividualist @HerodEoin Never.
@HerodEoin Happy birthday Luke!
@mkowl @JoeSaun55108441 @tone_paul @PeoplesMomentum Not a fair comparison. That was in the Labour manifesto, just as corporation tax cuts to court the business vote were in the Tory one.
@TonyPBenton But that was in the Labour manifesto, giving everyone the opportunity to vote for or against it. This billion to NI has been sprung on us.
Why put such a positive spin on it? It's not as honest as a bribe. This is a bribe using other people's money. https://t.co/2NKmMsdRPP
@AndyPMcDonald An interesting one. Some say those are establishing shots, like the exterior of the flat, so don't have to be a POV. My own view: a cow.
@waynecater1 Thank you, Wayne. You were extremely funny, take after take. It was great fun working with you.
@ashwirajn Maybe one day, but no immediate plans. Glad you like them.
A clear vision for the future at last. https://t.co/LdqRW5vcj8
Thanks for all the nice comments about the @Channel4 #AlternativeElectionNight. It was great fun to be involved with.
@JazzyJaney Yes I did - thanks so much, it's really brilliant. Glad you enjoyed the marathon broadcast!

@johnkellytweets I think that's the car park's slogan.
@Breathwick It was Slough rather than Windsor - filming in a damp car park. Am home now but thanks and see you soon and hope you're all thriving.
A shame about the horrible view from this lovely car park. https://t.co/Y7rC8F4efi
@Mahaloth Yes! We've already filmed it and it'll be on later in the year.
It was absolutely filthy weather. https://t.co/0RsgeQMFay
@OrigSafeguard It seems to come from Old French: https://t.co/ZjPDn9FRYR
@MashCAP Currently nothing, but do you think I should invoice?
@sambaintv @robertpopper @kylemooney That's very funny.
@GuanoLad Yes, but advertising copywriters are notoriously rushed and underpaid.
@GeorgeDuckett Good point. Bridesmaids buy cars too.
@Bigderbyman Yes, we'll be recording more in July.
"How horrible! They've put a hoarding right by the church where I'm getting married. I'm never buying a fucking Volkswagen." https://t.co/gleI5lAK91
@Baddiel That would be quite a dark episode of Only Fools and Horses.
@MrJamesBachman @rufusjones1 @arobertwebb @iammarkevans Excellent! Now I'm almost glad Trump became president.
@annalonsoo Thank you! And you're right. Seldom has seldom been more overused.
First day of filming on #BackC4 today (with @arobertwebb and written by @simonblackwell). It'll be on @Channel4 later this year. https://t.co/cr8wfBTDXd

@Safetyconundrum I have no interest in cars.
@ThePhoenicSoul It is not in my power to give you one. Try asking @BBCRadio4 18 times.

In today's Observer I predict a bleak future if radio DJs can't just say the first thing that pops into their heads. https://t.co/QJpRfkXhlo
@nerdfilmstudent It often has that effect.
@MrJamesBachman @Pellogrese It was for Cinderella in 1993. The costumes in the photo are entirely unconnected to our roles in the show. We just put some wacky stuff on.
@arobertwebb @DavidDPaxton @Gary_Bainbridge Not sure about a "written constitution" particularly considering who's likely to write it, but I'm a total convert to electoral reform &amp; PR.
Tonight's brand new Unbelievable Truth premieres on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm and features @frankieboyle, @wiggywalsh, @elisjames &amp; @mrmarksteel.
@MeJulies10 Thanks! I'm very glad you liked it. Enjoy the pontoon.
@sam1pm Thanks - glad you liked it. I wish we could have made more.
@nickchees1984 I have just been sick.
A new Unbelievable Truth (available since last week on the international integrated porn &amp; rage network) is on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30. FM or LW.
@KingOfWrong @GylesB1 For the record, I also think there's conclusive historical evidence that that person was William Shakespeare from Stratford-upon-Avon.
@hashpercentanex Don't worry, it's still defined as rich. I'd say that was the outcome of last week's row. My column is about why the row is revealing.
@kmholford Thanks! And I did - I thought it was the kind of loathsome thing that catches on.
I'm rich! Riiich! RIIIIIIIICH, I tell you!!! My Observer column is about how you don't hear that so much these days. https://t.co/pX2df8elKi
@marshallsl @nicolalaidlaw Happy Birthday, Nicola!
Somehow the bunny doesn't look as incongruous as it might have done in previous administrations. https://t.co/68MzNH0tQk
That should be a handy announcement for those without internet access but whose local town crier reads out Twitter.
Episode 3 of the current series of Unbelievable Truth, which has been on iPlayer for a week, is being broadcast on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30 today.
To all those asking, I didn't also draw my column's accompanying illustration. That was David Foldvari and was wrongly credited to me.
Sometimes the obvious answer is right! My Observer column is about a dynamic scheme to deal with NHS bed shortages. https://t.co/U9OtDDizEo

It's got @JohnFinnemore, @LouSanders, @henningwehn &amp; Miles Jupp in it, as you have already had ample opportunity to find out.
The 2nd ep of the new series of Unbelievable Truth is on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm today. But it's been on iPlayer for ages so this is old news.
My friend @alicemeallan has just published her first novel and, in deference to the age, there's a video to go with it. #openmyeyes https://t.co/OrVeeyWpGG
In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today: why I think it's vitally important to keep the pound! https://t.co/tSun3Q1G77
I'm worried the new mayor of Gibraltar, and former Miss World, isn't sufficiently "on message". https://t.co/CYJqEPHow0
@kbee287 Yes: https://t.co/Qr4ixAHVth.
@SMEmmett @EmmaJ70 @markmleach @katieduncan_UK @HotcoursesGroup @Natalie_ThePIE @Sara_ThePIENews @Whatuni Thank you! I enjoyed myself.
@joanne1972byrne Thank you!
To say #OnlyConnect teams are mental gymnasts would imply that gymnastics is more impressive. I say gymnasts are physical quizzers.
I find this news report extremely satisfying. https://t.co/LgZYJvOX4Z
I forgot that the 1st episode of the new series of The Unbelievable Truth was on tonight. But here it is on iPlayer. https://t.co/PM2JlTMzvl
Masterful use of the very amusing phrase "Who'da thunk it". Why does the Right always have such a monopoly on wit? https://t.co/YkaQsvo45B
In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today: I'm surprised the EU referendum result hasn't made more people happy. https://t.co/28Qemrq7HW
Very illuminating. But it would be great to see another photo to contextualise the pole - perhaps next to one of a set of Russian dolls? https://t.co/i0kFl1cwlF
@graspee I strongly disagree. Saying criticism of government/the status quo is "not constructive" leads inexorably to unquestioned tyranny.
@ikkleboo You're welcome!
@westham_boy1958 Thank you - that was absolutely what I was going for.
@Murphy1Sam Not at all - that was John Major's favourite bit as well.
In the Observer today, the PM makes a big song &amp; dance about something she could've done on her own in a cubicle. https://t.co/qZTqaMTET5
But @richardosman, if you win your argument in the eyes of the government, Jaffa Cakes will get 20% more expensive! #VAT https://t.co/dn6m68qm83
In my Observer column today: if you think you want to decide how a story you're enjoying turns out, you're wrong. https://t.co/jol53ZnzUp
@Juckylim Yes! Just finished filming. It should be on TV in the next 2-3 months, I think.
@MonicaSpoor I agree, if by "jokes" you mean "dicks of themselves".
@M_caveman I sense, from the fact that you asked that, that you're not a BT customer.
...which seems unlikely as I was a solemn child and it's full of silly jokes. The real co-author is @RayFripp. https://t.co/805GiGMdSi
An old friend of mine, @densewords, has written a book and claims to have based it on things he and I scribbled down as teenagers...
Good to see David Cameron has landed a job working for BT Openreach. https://t.co/0MbkbSGSo6
@emmafreud Absolutely - have done so.
@Slothmonkey1985 Thanks! We'd love to make more, but it requires some large TV-making organisation to commission it.
@JazzyJaney You're welcome! Glad you enjoyed it.
@The_Strovinator Thanks - we are proud of it and miss doing it.
@billiam_2k14 Happy birthday for two days ago!
@RealBearGamer I'm afraid not.
@ikkleboo Thank you! And I'll be back writing them in March.
That's not a bad idea. https://t.co/NdQ4yQ93TB
@BizerBizer I think there may be a typo in your demand. My dealings with Russia are above reproach.
The top half of my body will once again be televised this evening as part of "8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown", at 9pm on @Channel4.
@JackGingeMiller Maybe one day, not sure.
@LauraMursell Why don't they just put the whole bowl in a bag too!
@alisonchapman Thank you!
@chloe_foden You're welcome! Glad you liked it. We're filming a second series at the moment.
@andoguest I'm flattered that that's how you see me.
@HendrickTurner You're welcome.
@TK_Noodle Thanks- nice of you to say. Glad you enjoyed it.
This is nice. If you voted for us, thanks a lot! If you didn't, thanks a lot! (You have to inflect them differently.) https://t.co/Jk7Z4Fjhy0
This is frightening on the subject of the blizzard of lies that's on its way. https://t.co/FhPxx3sanK
This is bad news for those who are sick of my moaning. https://t.co/GC2SdVfdFG
@NickPoole1 Of course! In fact, don't think you need my permission. Just put that it was me writing in the Observer.
@ThisIsGreels Yes, sorry - he was just a figure of fun back then.
@Butler_Gooner14 Thanks - nice of you to say. Glad you liked it.
@maxima120 These days I'm not 100% positive of anything, but I certainly think it's likely to be the main cause.
@BeatnikBrian Thanks!
@BeatnikBrian That photo, I'm afraid to say, was taken in 2008.
@31ltolox Quite. That's what I'm saying.
@darksith7 You haven't read the article, have you? Not much point just slagging off the tweet that links to it.
@rmjmcleod If you'd read the article you'd understand that it wasn't.
In my Observer column today, why I'm fed up of the "Garden Bridge" and they haven't even built it yet. https://t.co/vAuzEWSEvY
@JasonHirstowitz Toast.
@MissMegsy76 Very glad you like the show. There are 9 series, all on DVD in the UK, not sure about Aus though. https://t.co/lntbd6dDDQ
@david_mitchell Thanks David - and likewise. Have a great 2017.
@anna_e_shaw Excellent plan!
@arilynnstein I think you mean @david_mitchell.
@hughlandsman What is so odd about your string of tweets is that you echo precisely a point I made in my column as if in refutation of it.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is even gassier than usual: it's about fizzy drinks and fracking. https://t.co/ji0kV7Rm3F
@Juckylim Yes, we start shooting the second series in mid-January.
@budslinger1972 @BBCRadio4 @slepkane @JohnFinnemore It's certainly not worth watching- it's on the radio.
I'm in a new sci-fi comedy called #TimeSpanner on @BBCRadio4 at 4.30 today. It's written by @slepkane, has @JohnFinnemore in it &amp; is funny.
@fionaawardle Hope you enjoy it.
@FreeThinkingUK Upstart Crow and yes.
How can the old media keep pace with the new? By guessing the news! In the Observer today, my retrospective on 2017. https://t.co/Xpr8sx8j52
@Brittellyaddict Thanks. I don't seem to get the e-mails about these things.
@JudiRanson Good point. It's an interesting phrase, carrying an implication not just of rudeness but of barbarity.
I recently met Carrie Fisher and chatted briefly. She was wonderful. I can't imagine how much those who knew her well will miss her.
At 9pm tonight on C4, I'm in the Big Fat Quiz of the Year. Watch us all try and make light of the bleakness.
It's the BRAND NEW @WILTY_TV Christmas Special tonight, @BBCOne, 8.30pm. With @richardosman, @sarapascoe, @chris_kammy &amp; Sir Tom Courtenay!
In today's Observer: as Christmas draws near, what could be more festive than a tirade against energy privatisation? https://t.co/nI9VLxt3IT
@kbasko I wish I could, but no one involves me in such decisions. It's available on the Channel 4 website, but possibly only in the UK.
@copenedin It would make me happy for you, so yes.
@olivia_sinc I didn't disbelieve you! Sorry I couldn't say a proper hello, was mid-phone call. But I hope you're enjoying the book.
@jonclea Thanks! If I ever think of suing, I might call you to give evidence.
My Observer column today is about an Oxford graduate who thinks his life is unfair. He's right, one way or another. https://t.co/pWJBsyS4Xb

@JampotsG @Bessemerband Refugees find refuge by becoming immigrants, so not a big difference no. The former are a subset of the latter.
@seanrmccoy99 Maybe one day.
I'm on tonight's #QI with all the people in this photograph. It's on @BBCTwo at 10pm and it's all about NIGHT. https://t.co/LOf2sczXVM
@MrChrisBrand @tobydavies Yes indeed - it was great fun running away from you.
@Filiusrogeri That's quite the accusation! No, I wrote it myself, as I always do. Though for half of it I was trying to sound like Trump.
@Cattleclass Any time!
@Celeryslut Sort of. Farage was elected to a Parliament whose existence he abhors &amp; Trump got 2nd highest number of votes in the election.
@Cattleclass Yes, it's a Sunday newspaper - the oldest in the world. Its articles are also published on the Guardian website.
In my Observer column: having pitched Farage as UK ambassador to the US, what are Trump's other recruitment ideas? https://t.co/arksiQWHKG
@FirehorseP @JazzyJaney @MaxGriffinUK There will be a second series - we're shooting it in January and February.
@jocat1980 We're shooting it next summer, so next autumn?
That's brilliant - and in an art form almost as old as the studio sitcom. @JazzyJaney https://t.co/qsO5VGiYu1
@acmgospelchoir Great working with you too - you were absolutely brilliant.
Ha ha! How about "For people who like to get it up on their own"? #avsstrapline https://t.co/2Mvwa9zSQc

@LeoJCarey The Quart Pot! Now, that's a name no one's wasted time over-thinking.
@philipmunoz Thanks, very glad you enjoyed it. Though I prefer "middle-aged romantic".
@LeoJCarey @simonblackwell @arobertwebb Thanks Leo!
Your first guess at the subject of my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today would almost certainly be correct. https://t.co/4hiboXagpS
@TeasplosionB A lot of unexpected things are happening at the moment! Thanks for disagreeing so nicely and I'm glad you like the show.
@TeasplosionB I'm afraid I strongly disagree. And I'm afraid.
Not a reassuring read. "His level of egotism is rarely exhibited outside of a clinical environment." https://t.co/TpmAbWhzVv
Sorry for mispronouncing Happisburgh in Norfolk on @UnbelieveTruth. It seems you say it "Haysbrough" not how I did. Sorry, I didn't realise.
Last of this run of @UnbelieveTruth is on R4, 6.30 today w/ humour derivers @frankieboyle, @lucyportercomic, @JeremyJHardy &amp; @JohnFinnemore.
Thanks @Pancraciopelaez, it's really lovely. And, as an added bonus, I'm sorted for a profile pic if I ever go on Tinder. https://t.co/toaGqHyrAN

My Observer column today is about the Olympic hangover. But it has nothing to do with performance enhancing drugs. https://t.co/9qoGIVVNa6
@EthanoJonz I heard that 1234 has been compromised as well.
@KeithThePoet Thanks!
@GregoryDeanHall I can only apologise to you both.
@_lucasemme Are you asking if I'm on Instagram or grading it? If the former, no I'm not. If the latter, I'm now less likely to try it.
@GregoryDeanHall I know exactly what that's like.
@JazzyJaney Thanks!
@Scrapsterelly They've really captured my bulbous forearms.
@EvelynBooth The CIA has suppressed it.
@BeadzBazaar Maybe one day. For now, I was just admiring a pub from afar.
@blaurobot No.
I'm on #Catscountdown on C4 at 9pm today w/ @ladycariad, @russellhoward, @samsimmonss &amp; regulars. It's full of ideas for internet passwords.
@smile_of_decade @Michael_42 This isn't a problem of the BBC's making. They're not the ones who have a go at people who don't wear one.
Now THAT'S what I call a headline! https://t.co/dAwuK13NE4
@Michael_42 I'm afraid I think you're right. The rage that failing to make the gesture invokes strips the gesture of its supposed meaning.
@Michael_42 I think, if you were, you might conclude that that's a reason to wear one rather than a reason not to.
@lucypaul77 Thanks very much - glad you enjoyed it.
@RealMattKing @arobertwebb @Aidan_Beck For me, that tie doesn't look defeated enough.
@Kindofblue6 @arobertwebb Thank you - those are excellent costumes. Happy Hallowe'en!
@jeremyjsharp It hasn't already aired, but they've developed the habit of putting it on the internet before broadcasting it.
At 6.30pm on R4, @frankieboyle, @lucyportercomic, @JeremyJHardy &amp; @JohnFinnemore lie about musicals, weddings, Oxbridge &amp; @realDonaldTrump.
Then, at 9pm on @BBCOne, I'll be hosting this week's @haveigotnews, with guests @RhonddaBryant and @Rose_Matafeo alongside the regulars.
The compilation episode of this series of @WILTY_TV is on tonight (8.30 @BBCOne). It's 100% new material, like this: https://t.co/inzfQgYvWf
@davidgood89 Thanks! And we'll be shooting 'Back' next spring, so it should be broadcast later in the year.
That is, in my view, simply splendid. https://t.co/Ue7Fllmjzd

Today's @UnbelieveTruth (R4, 6.30pm) is a rhythmless 'a cappella' rap by Clive Anderson, @richardosman, @vickipepperdine &amp; @thefridgeman.
An interesting new take on this very very old joke: write it out so it doesn't work. https://t.co/XtFZ6uhkgX

On tonight's @WILTY_TV, @AdamWoodyatt, @Jason__Watkins, @PhilNWang &amp; Maggie Aderin-Pocock all show themselves to be untrustworthy. 8:30 BBC1
@bfgfox Thanks - very glad you're enjoying it.
Just saw @Dawn_French's "30 Million Minutes". What a great night. She is incredibly funny and it's a very warm and moving show.
@aipsmith @michaelehughes It certainly did! I thought it was hilarious. I've never enjoyed an opera more (or indeed on any other occasion).
@aipsmith Were you the Adam Smith who did an Eric Morecambe impression while playing a non-singing role in an opera in about 1993?
Today's new episode of @UnbelieveTruth stars Clive Anderson, @richardosman, @vickipepperdine &amp; @thefridgeman. It's on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm.
I very much enjoyed this: https://t.co/EQHjEnQysJ
@dreamofmerle Thanks!
@jamiesont @thatjanravens What a good party! It was very nice to see you both - please excuse whatever I was talking about.
@BlueEyedUtahn @KatCarralite No, haven't muted you! Just can't always reply to tweets.
My Observer column today is about a magical machine that can make anything delicious. It's not a deep fat fryer. https://t.co/gKn0DVRqrI
On @WILTY_TV tonight: @officialswr, @claraamfo, @BigTomD &amp; @henningwehn, mixing lies and truths like seasoned adulterers. 8:30pm, @BBCOne.
@alorollo Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed it.
@Elliecogh Happy birthday to him!
Yes! Of course he shouldn't! And not because he isn't an arsehole, but because only arseholes believe in that sort of ban. For example: him. https://t.co/L79EiTLcsi
Zapped, a new comedy by Dan Gaster, Will Ing &amp; @PGPowell (all v funny), starts tonight at 9.40 on Dave. Worth viewing unless you hate jokes. https://t.co/pFGINgv9pY
@shaunhutchinson Thanks - very glad you liked it! We start filming series 2 in January and it'll be on later in the year.
On today's brand new Unbelievable Truth (@BBCRadio4 6.30pm), the panel is invited to lie about McDonald's, basketball, wood and Tom Cruise.
@angcameron I hope it would be better in the right order, but you may have improved it.
@AshAtalla Thanks Ash! Much appreciated.
In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today, I ask whether the Home Secretary is racist or unpatriotic or both. https://t.co/uPqjd9WVYI
Tonight's brand new @WILTY_TV features these liars: @ClaudiaWinkle, @JamieLaing_UK, @TracyAnnO &amp; @rhodgilbertshow. @BBCOne, 8:30pm.
@Rahskal1 No, I don't think so. I think it was an edition of This American Life but I'm not sure.
A brand new series of The Unbelievable Truth starts on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30 today, with Rich Hall, Lloyd Langford, @wiggywalsh &amp; @henningwehn.
@fsutrill I don't believe that can happen. Some will always need the affirmation of being part of the in crowd.That's what fashion preys on.
@michaelmcq Very.
My Observer column today is about why fashion journalists, of all people, can't get away with seeming old fashioned. https://t.co/BFKdKLlJjv
In tonight's brand new @WILTY_TV, the truths and lies come from @joshwiddicombe, @IAMKEVBISH, @KateWilliamsme &amp; @brianblessed. 8:30pm BBC1.

My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about what happened when a middle-aged man went to Eton. https://t.co/gg2g5lqwsL
Watch the repeats of the future today! Brand new @WILTY_TV (8.30pm BBC1) with Mel Giedroyc, @realmartinkemp, @mrdavidhaye &amp; @RomeshRanga.
@Herring1967 Yes, it really is a unique use of the medium.
@MrJohnNicolson I'll certainly have a look at the Mary Whitehouse one.
Round of applause! https://t.co/dMGWaS3aoG
@MrHolness Yes! Saying the word 'fact' as a rhetorical clincher is a technique sadly missing from current debate.
@MrJohnNicolson It was captivating - I'm sincerely glad it happened.
@robinince @ReeceShearsmith Why were none of those kids interested in foot revivers or golf trolleys? They're wasting their lives.
@MrJohnNicolson @ValerieRooney1 I think he was expecting more questions about cricket.
@ReeceShearsmith It is an inexplicable programme. I managed to watch most of it but, by the end, I could barely remember my previous life.
Oh damn, it's been done. https://t.co/uGXfszSMKI
Programme idea: cricketer Ian Botham sits in a studio and quietly answers questions from an audience of Scottish teenagers who dislike him.
@DanaSchwartzzz Thanks so much! That's very nice of you to say. You've made me briefly glad the internet exists.
I don't know if you've got a television but, if so, I'll be on it at 9pm, performing poorly in a word game. #CatsCountdown @Channel4
@RealDonElliott I'm honoured.
@robotswan At last - a PROPER avocado bath.
@chrisdalrymple Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed it.
Thanks @keltbh! I think you really captured me. https://t.co/88nFTCBRqe
@LorenzoSace How can he NEED £9bn? Gambling debts? I get that you want small govrnmnt but should lower tax rate be paid on larger estates?!
@mollykh Well that's ideal, because we really take everything down a peg or two.
@solipsismworld No. I very seldom tweet about repeats and, if I do, I always say that's what it is.
@SimonWilliams81 There's nothing for them, which they find fascinating.
@ajwoodroffe It's either. I usually go for 'baulk', but 'balk' is the Observer house style.
@MedEighty Thanks! To assuage your annoyance: it was 0 to the nearest billion, not absolutely no money at all. Hence the "approximately".
I'm on tonight's Big Fat Quiz of Everything on C4. Great for those interested in everything, or any of its aspects. https://t.co/dNKnbyV8JO
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about the late Duke of Westminster's weird obsession. https://t.co/sdZMOtGsun
@alunscott2000 It's me, but I don't say very much.
@RealMattLucas Thanks Matt! Glad you liked it.
If you're in Edinburgh looking for entertainment in the morning, I've heard this show is terrific. https://t.co/eDcKwgOqn3
My Observer column today is about how, even if you hate cruel jokes, you might miss them if they stop being allowed. https://t.co/C8D5hz9qAA
@Rachael_Totty No, though oddly JR Ewing is a fictional cousin on my mother's side.
@MrsNickleby Thank you - yes there was. But I don't think I envisaged continuing to assert that seven years later.
@keltbh Thanks! Very glad you like the show. And great cartoon - though I contend that Mark never did up the top button of his pyjamas.
@MatthewS_mith No audiobook, I'm afraid - but it is in paperback.
@NoMonsterInMe We had a BBC model B, which I've always thought was rather swanky.
@KatCarralite Of course - there's no monopoly on sitting in front of a camera and saying what you think!
@UrquhartKieran Hope you like it!
@gasm0n @iammarkevans Very glad to hear it (though I'm not sure your patient would be).
@NataliasDad Yes, I'm now a bit embarrassed I went for the 'real' thing when I signed up. The fact he did too only intensifies that feeling.
@david_mitchell Thanks, that's extremely nice of you. Honoured to share your name too. &amp; yes, the origamist exists! https://t.co/YxOodUaSGc.
@david_mitchell Not your fault; I'm undoubtedly cheapening your brand. I'm delighted you liked Amb'rs! Sadly the BBC didn't, so no more.
@callumsp You're welcome - very glad you enjoyed it.
@srfkultur I think you mean @david_mitchell, not me.
@CharlieRivers Thank you!
@gasm0n I think that one was by @iammarkevans.
@krause56 I'm afraid that's not me - I know next to nothing about whisky.
Despairing of the whole British political mess? In my Observer column today I guess a way it might tidy itself up. https://t.co/jecnoLK245
@CHIMPSINSOCKS Well that'll certainly jolly things up when they're discussing Syria.
@TimDownie1 Thanks - and the same to you! Have a lovely day.

@JazzyJaney Thanks!
Is that actually now the job title? https://t.co/NmT2rVyGs6
@SueKirk You know. Think about it and you'll realise that you know.
@antisyzygy @RevDaniel @Number10cat What an odd tweet. No it isn't.
@firecracker_555 No, two phrases can easily possess the attribute of being contradictory without contradicting one another.
Ooh yes, those Conservatives really are a bit crawley. https://t.co/DURiYkz3H9
"Honoured" and "humbled" have precisely opposite and mutually contradictory meanings. https://t.co/BZSgiL6RE6

@MarkHaselgrove Blimey, haven't seen that for a while. As I recall, it was about a dystopian nightmare. Felt like a fun topic, at the time.
@DiLarfing Because it's 100,000s of words of new writing every week, and the online version is free. It certainly doesn't make a profit.

@nickrobertson54 Is there a prize for guessing yours? If so, I might give it a go.
First Boris expects us to believe he wants Brexit, now that he wants ANDREA LEADSOM to be the PRIME MINISTER. I think his writers are tired.

@smcollier1234 @Freedland Doesn't need to be anything like most people. If 5% of leave vote had been remain, would've been opposite result.

This column by @Freedland hits the nail on the head. https://t.co/719DiiXpZE
@Mikey_Franks Something like that would certainly do the trick.
@hollowornate I think, if anything, something like that would add to his allure.
@ThatJamesCary @sitcomgeek Yes there's altogether too much rage around, from all sides, at the moment.
Bloody hell - what is it that Michael Gove knows about Boris Johnson?!
@ThatJamesCary @sitcomgeek That's not illogical, James. Johnson helped engineer this situation - now he's washing his hands of it.
@moveandmatch Ah yes - there they are! I was probably at home watching Dynasty.

@GFoxyFowler Thanks Graeme!
@densewords I wish I could say it was deliberate. At least I can type it.

@mikellyleugh @FraserNelson Well said. In this era of referendums, we downplay the importance of the 50% mark at our peril.
@FraserNelson @jnmulholland And I'm saying the fact Scotland may now leave makes "greatest-ever vote of confidence" in UK an odd conclusion.
Referendum described by @FraserNelson as "greatest-ever vote of confidence in the project of the United Kingdom." https://t.co/ZJWSOFgSfL
@NinShish @nbarrett100 Thank you - it's brilliantly put.
Having said that, this comment from an FT reader is testing my resolve. https://t.co/jlXPyc5Onf
@superdadstee Wow, you really think the worst of people, don't you.
Well that's that then. There's only one thing for it: I'm going to try and pretend I don't mind.
@scotstars Likewise - you made me feel ten feet tall.
Some people have asked which way I'll be voting in tomorrow's referendum. I'm going to vote to remain in the EU, as you probably expected.
@PhilipHeslop Now I feel even worse.
@comedybubble Thanks - glad you enjoyed it.
I'm on tonight's Heresy (R4, 6.30pm) with @Sathnam, @realkatybrand &amp; @VictoriaCoren WHO IS MY WIFE! I think I was rude about George Clooney.
In more imminent news, I'm on tonight's episode of "Alan Davies As Yet Untitled" on @Join_Dave at 10pm.
The last of this series of Upstart Crow is available here - https://t.co/42E5284oBb - and I'm happy to say we'll be making more next year.
@ProfGSheffield Thanks Gary - glad you liked it. BTW I really enjoyed "Forgotten Victory" - very interesting and illuminating.
@sambaintv Thanks, Sam!
It's the last in the series of Upstart Crow tonight, at 10pm @BBCTwo. Here's a clip. https://t.co/WBtt3iZuwy
@DavidCrosEyre I'll be voting to stay in.
@NBThieves I think you can get it on @All4.
@Mick_the_Knife Perfect!
I also hate the 'having to'/'have to' repetition in my last tweet. Sorry about that.
My Observer column today: I hate having to remember passwords and I'm tired of spending time somewhere I have to. https://t.co/oVoy3JYYeW
"The LEAST RACIST person THERE IS"?! Huge if true. https://t.co/GOtB6yhQX2
@MCabournSmith Thanks!
Monday's Upstart Crow is now available here for any UK-based owner of modern machinery. https://t.co/r0UREaWsvT
@OBrienJack Stay.
@wearethe_sound That's what my nightmares look like.
@MrGaryRaymond There's actually another next week - glad you like the show.
@kathbelyea Thanks - glad you approved.
@surftastic1571 You're welcome - very glad you enjoyed it.
@jaynightingale9 Thanks!
Hear hear. https://t.co/UYls2Eogdo
@BethanyStayer Thanks, but I didn't write it - you mean @david_mitchell.
@jeffp221 No plans at the moment, but maybe one day.
Tonight's Upstart Crow discusses such issues as witches, milk, casual xenophobia and the property ladder. 10pm @BBCTwo
@nicholasgtodd You're welcome! Very glad you like it.
Here's a clip from tomorrow's episode of Upstart Crow. https://t.co/bX5fYT33Vi
@jeffp221 Thanks - that's very nice of you to say.
@BunSeller Very glad you enjoyed it.
@pauleganmanc That's camembert!
@JasonManford Thanks Jason!
Last night's Upstart Crow is now viewable here (unless you're outside the UK which, I do realise, most people are).  https://t.co/cQNKrbyAB1
Here's a clip from tonight's episode of Upstart Crow, which is on @BBCTwo at 10pm. Hope you like it. https://t.co/P8v6JmEimK
@annaturley You're welcome - glad you approve!
@NightCatArts That's what needs to change. Somehow they're getting, and therefore are preparing for, the wrong sort of scrutiny.
@JumpRobert That's basically my view.
@victoria_write @LukeWhito Thanks - but I'm afraid that's it for a decade or so.
@drgerke1 No, I'm advocating a democratically elected parliament which then makes the decisions. It's not that controversial.
@KatCarralite Thanks!
@Johnhattery Of course, having promised the referendum at the election, he had to call it. But was cowardly and selfish to stand on that.
@aalenian2009 I think it would be difficult for parliament to ignore its result.
@terrortoria Thanks - glad you agree.
@thechriswales But no one's talking about giving any way - it's a question of whether or not to take some back.
In today's Observer, I think I know the worst thing David Cameron's done - and it's nothing to do with a pig's head. https://t.co/Giotn3CJvY
@davidkerrtv Bloody hell - decades really are getting shorter! Hope all's good with you.
Episode 3 of Upstart Crow, The Apparel Proclaims The Man, is on this bit of the Internet: https://t.co/L0VkfuEcrv
@Blunty_Poet Ah, sorry - you'll have an easier time next week.
@sad_dracula Sorry - I don't think Mark and Jeremy would have got that excited about Hallowe'en.
Here's a clip from tonight's Upstart Crow (10pm, BBC2) featuring Liza Tarbuck, Paula Wilcox &amp; Harry Enfield. https://t.co/ubkK9ABVdT
@intergeri Thanks - and it's a live audience. Canned laughter is never used in sitcoms - hasn't been for decades. It's always an audience.
If, like me, you're a fan of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway', you can watch it live at the London Palladium next month. https://t.co/efNNSWEyt4
@Wayne_Sloman @qikipedia Good point!
Just seven minutes to go until we get televisual proof that elves exist. https://t.co/hnuDNG9jmZ
My awareness of #WilliamsSyndrome has been raised to an unprecedented level by this. It is also a funny sketch. https://t.co/OMTu32qY7e
I saw @Baddiel's new show @MenChocFactory last night and it was brilliant. Intriguing, insightful and very funny. Heartily recommended.
@lde1ect I salute you.
@dubrastein I hope and expect it'll be shown there at some point, but I don't make those decisions.
@rorybremner Thanks very much, Rory. Very glad you enjoyed the show.
@RupertMyers Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
Episode 2 of Upstart Crow, featuring the hilarious @TimDownie1 as Christopher Marlowe, is now available here: https://t.co/2IejXwGGsW
It's episode 2 of Upstart Crow tonight, at 10pm on @BBCTwo. Here's a clip: https://t.co/U9t850nTr4
My column in today's Observer: an embarrassed monarch, an embarrassed prime minister and an embarrassing email. https://t.co/Lac4atqh5F
@frankieboyle Thanks very much, Frankie. Kind of you to tweet and I'm extremely glad you liked it.
Just about to be on #bbcsaturdaylive on @BBCRadio4 - https://t.co/TyWsJbqo9L
@susiek227 Neither was the ghost of Dame Nellie Melba's father.
@oOTrygvelineOo Sorry, it ALWAYS does that.
@Claytoncast Thanks very much, Paul - I'm so glad you liked it.
@PGPowell @garethmammal Thanks Paul - really glad you liked it.
@peternobes44 Thanks! That would actually be a great quote for the DVD.
@saltbeefTV Thanks Jeremy - very glad you liked it.
Thanks for all the nice comments about Upstart Crow - very glad so many enjoyed it. If you missed it, it's now here: https://t.co/7hVDCv8raG
Here's another clip from Upstart Crow, a new sitcom about Shakespeare by Ben Elton. It starts tonight, 10pm @BBCTwo. https://t.co/u2WdAYJKGa
The last episode of this series of Unbelievable Truth is on R4 at 6.30 today with @reginalddhunter, @elisjames, @maevehiggins &amp; @phlaimeaux.
Here's another clip from this Monday's Upstart Crow (BBC2, 10pm), with @robrouse and @KieranCHodgson. https://t.co/nBcUweI4ks
@davidkerrtv Thanks David - hope you enjoy it.
In tonight's Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30), all the goodness of @RonJichardson, @henningwehn, @SusanCalman and @TheRealJackDee combined.
Here are @Helen_Monks, Liza Tarbuck and me in a bit from Upstart Crow, which starts on 9th May at 10pm on @BBCTwo. https://t.co/Q55CZ0gWm1
@JoePetrie2 I do feel thanked - thank you! Please feel thanked for the thanks.
I'm JUST in time to mention the Unbelievable Truth! It's on R4 in 5 mins &amp; features @richardosman, @joelycett, @samsimmonss &amp; @WeeMissBea.
@2pagesaweek Date still not finalised - but likely to be early/mid May.
@Sir_Mett_A_Lot No, there won't.
The panellists are (or, if you listened on the internet, were) @reginalddhunter, @elisjames, @maevehiggins and @phlaimeaux.
Tonight's Unbelievable Truth has been online for a few days - that is apparently now the system - but it won't be on Radio 4 till 6.30pm.
@Now8Zen Thank you - nice of you to say. I withdraw my accusation of humourlessness.
@SELondoner Thank you - very glad you enjoyed it.
@Now8Zen No, that phrase was put in specifically to elicit the ire of those humourless enough to take it literally. Many thanks.
My Observer column today is about a ruined palace, an old sorting office &amp; 100s of politicians getting in the way. https://t.co/6jTlt3kO6G
@amylau_ @JNHolmes20 I can't anymore - I've moved house.
@SE_Dresden Thanks - very glad you liked it!
@fairhaven999 Glad you enjoyed the recording - I think it'll be on in May.
@Herring1967 Yes, I assume it is deliberate, but I would love it if it wasn't deliberate.
@rickygervais Yes, that would rhyme AND make the song more jaunty.
@jondrytay Now you're trying to make a virtue of slurred diction.
@MrHolness Of course!
@charltonbrooker I'm not. That one was previously planted in my brains, where it still remains.
@nathan_oxley That could be plural too.
Just occurred to me: why didn't they make it "And the visionS that were planted in my brain, still remain" so that it would rhyme properly?
@efbman No, but it's available on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Radio app post-broadcast.
Another brand new Unbelievable Truth is on R4 at 6.30pm today. Guests are @richardosman, @joelycett, @WeeMissBea &amp; @samsimmonss.
@jondrytay Thanks Jon!
My Observer column today: a Tudor mansion &amp; how oddly infuriating it is that the super-rich don't like nice things. https://t.co/RVg6coQpcD
A BRAND NEW series of The Unbelievable Truth starts today, 6.30, Radio 4, with @RonJichardson, @henningwehn, @SusanCalman &amp; @TheRealJackDee.
@AndrewDEvans I'll settle for that.
@JazzyJaney I think it'll be on in early May. No date yet.
@ThorleyGary Why don't you read it and find out.
My Observer column today is about homeopathy, croissants and sewer rats: i.e. the reboot of "Great Western Railway". https://t.co/NnbGxJfCAh
@nobesy993 It's all on https://t.co/uyDJhRQAhf .
@AlwaysAmyH Fortunately I panic bought years ago.
@robinson52d1987 I'm very sorry to hear that - but very glad if the show was helpful.
@The_Mole_UK I think there's actually a version of '8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown' without the comedians, but its name escapes me.
@verittarae Thanks!
@addedcolours Yes.
@AndrewDEvans Hope you're enjoying it, and don't just feel it's holding you hostage.
@CleverJames No. In another form.
If you'd like to help @Herring1967 make a new series, here's how. If you'd like to hinder him, you're on your own. https://t.co/AqAqHXloS0
To add further to the allure of tonight's #CatsCountdown, it will contain footage of me eating cheese. https://t.co/jHH1J0M2cz
@PapaBeats That was a fun day.
I was lucky enough to meet Ronnie Corbett a few times and he was a lovely man. A great comedian and a real gentleman. RIP.
@m4rko A lovely pitch, featuring of course - as they all do - the prime minister's PIN.
@fmartinezhidal1 Thanks for the tweet! Very kind of you to say.
@alicemeallan I certainly found it so! Hope you're enjoying it. I'm glad to hear that such racy material is permitted in Uzbekistan.
I think 'writing' might actually be my favourite craft. Either that or basket weaving. No, basket weaving. #youcantchuckdirtysocksinaplay
Congratulations to all (but mainly to @sambaintv and @jessearmstrong1)! https://t.co/T4Z97ouk9M

Always nice to see lots of punctuation errors in a tweet from someone defending fascists. https://t.co/A5T8YYkQhe
My Observer column, to mark the special EU-themed edition of @ObsNewReview, is about a Nazi. https://t.co/nEt3iPbSUK
@SquirrelPixie Thanks - very glad you liked it!
@jpbechtold It's best to contact Michele Milburn @MilburnBrowning.
Thanks Sam - but those quatre-bises guys are out of their minds. That's a mini bout of necking. https://t.co/JBF2582eiZ
@right2debate Thank you. I will do.
@jamesmcnamara27 Thank you!
@afraidtomerge Thanks - glad you like them. Maybe one day and, if so, I'll certainly steal your idea.
@Honxqp Yes, but it's a pity that prominent among those arguing against statue's removal is one who wrongly thinks it depicts a great man.
@jendifa I'm beginning to think maybe I was.
@Danny1971turner Thanks, non-showbiz chum.
@IamHappyToast Yes, that's very well put.
@AdamBuxton Thanks!
My Observer column today is about how almost everyone in history was a bit horrible, and so we probably are too. https://t.co/wtYyQ7MLnw
@Lucy_G_Findlay Thank you! Very glad you enjoyed it.
@IAndySI WHAT is that?!
@garvie1 Thanks Wayne, and yes exactly. Seems they want to restrict the BBC to ideas which DEFINITELY won't capture the public imagination.
My Observer column today is about a boring report which says that BBC programmes should be boring. https://t.co/hbdEV5RpVg
@MrJamesBachman That is one of my very few wise sayings. But it is EXTREMELY wise.
@Olivavu They would be if they were bought by some men. Currently they're Tod's shoes and, in my view, likely to remain so.
New from Tod's: horrible shoes! https://t.co/twLzWvq2xN
@MarcPowellJudo Thank you! I'm very pleased to hear it.
@3oeJones @MustardTV I regret to say that it's @david_mitchell you mean, not me.
@DommMcG @heatherLxx Happy birthday, Heather!
@dinnydaethat Not by me, by @david_mitchell.
@annijaybee @JournoJenkins67 Nice.
@alicemeallan Thanks Alice! Nice to see you on here.
I stand corrected. They were nasty little things anyway. https://t.co/yQv9H62Lf2
My Observer column tries to get inside Boris Johnson's head, like the worm that got Chekov in The Wrath of Khan. https://t.co/bN95F2y0IT
@CorribEnglish Very glad you liked it!
@asherjbaker Thanks! I mean, no thanks - but thanks!
@sallyjwatson @VictoriaCoren We missed it - which, having just looked up the result, I'm rather sorry about.
My Observer column this week addresses an ABSOLUTELY VITAL question COMPLETELY INADEQUATELY. https://t.co/qWWAqmJr7V
@bevwilburn You're welcome - very glad you enjoyed it.
@WhelanGemma Yes, it was a great 6 weeks. Was brilliant working with you. Fingers crossed we'll get the chance again.
@richardmingus Thanks. Glad you're enjoying the final run.
@robertmz22 Thanks for your patience and hope you enjoy it.
@ickyandtweet Thanks Lizanne - welcome to Twitter!
@alstewitn Thanks very much for tweeting! Very glad you enjoyed it.
Brand new compilation @WILTY_TV, tonight 9.30 BBC1! 100% unseen lies/truths from @RealBobMortimer, @MrDDyer, @clarebalding, @gdavies &amp; more.
@tediouslength You're welcome! I hope it brings you luck.
@PaintMeBitz You're welcome! Glad you're enjoying it.
@maevehiggins Ah, a lovely tiny golden edition! The perfect toilet book.
The panellists are @ActualBenMiller, @henningwehn, Doon Mackichan and @alex_brooker.
There is a BRAND NEW episode of @WILTY_TV on BBC1 tonight at 8.30pm, which for some reason was not broadcast with the rest of the series.
@garyjkemp Thanks - glad you liked it. But yes, it's worrying what our phones are turning is into (he typed into his phone).
The last programme in my series about manners is on Radio 4, tomorrow at 9am. Hope you like it and thanks to those who've been tuning in.
@josielawrence1 Thanks Josie - very glad you liked it.
Here's a clip from tomorrow's episode of my programme about manners. It's on Radio 4 at 9am. https://t.co/Ru3GG2VFNK
@DorsetRebel I quite agree - though that makes it our generation's job to start settling it.
@robdelaney @hugorifkind Fair point and noted. Personally I'm keeping my options open.
@hugorifkind Great column. Really cheered me up about us lot.
Thanks for all the polite comments about my manners programme. Episode 2 is tomorrow at 9am on R4 and ep 1 is here: https://t.co/kmFYrarbA8
@Peston Thanks, very glad you enjoyed it. But yes, we could have done a whole programme about elbows on the table!
Please listen to my documentary about good manners on Radio 4 this week, starting tomorrow at 9am. Or just fucking don't.
@paubai No, that was directed to the internet, not signed from it. Apologies for the ambiguity.
In the Observer today: my annual exercise in predictive hindsight. https://t.co/LGxernEJGR
@myauralfixation It wasn't based on any specific show.
@redzedi I'm afraid you're thinking of @david_mitchell, not me.
Fancy a quiz? I'm on a Big Fat one on C4 tonight at 9, as are @iamjobrand, @RichardAyoade, @ClaudiaWinkle, @gdavies, @RobBrydon &amp; @jimmycarr
Happy Christmas, the internet!
@Firegal_01 I doubt it, I'm sorry to say.
@GetItQuietly Thanks - I love playing interfering functionaries.
@TJ_Crucial Definitely light-hearted - I don't mind at all! Happy Christmas!
And at 8, I reprise my role of crusading liar in @WILTY_TV at Christmas with guests @iamjobrand, @damekellyholmes, @BillBailey &amp; Ruth Jones.
Do watch this, at 5.20 today, in which I reprise my heroic role of a crusading local bureaucrat. #PagwellCouncil https://t.co/lFKOZO9XBP
@timseesthelight I've had that dream.
@BonnieEPike Thank you! That would make a nice quote for the cover.
@TJ_Crucial You have made a horrible thing.
@jwskinner Just looking at it is enough to induce a meaty burp.
@brainopener Thank you, and best wishes for your own cauliflower-free festivities.
@the8valver Nice even surface.
@EwanGleadow Well they look tastier than anything Mark could make.
@HaleyJoelOsment Thank you! Very glad you enjoyed.
My Observer column today is a Christmas merchandising fairytale from space. #starwars https://t.co/L7067StTUu
@Baddiel That's incredibly nice of you - thanks David!
@davidschneider Very glad you liked it - thanks so much for coming.
@Glinner Thanks Graham - I really felt it might be Sam and Jesse's finest hour.
Thank you for all the nice messages about Peep Show. I'm very glad so many people enjoyed it - it was certainly fun to make.
@2manyrookies That is kind and inaccurate in equal measure.
Bloody hell. https://t.co/YLk92HYQOZ
In honour of the LAST EVER EPISODE OF PEEP SHOW (tonight, 10pm, C4), here's Mark looking lonely outside his flat. https://t.co/h5ZzyTSGJi
@wmarybeard Please do!
@Schroedinger99 Thanks!
@wmarybeard Exactly - he was always a ridiculous choice. But now they've decided he's SO indefensible, his money no longer makes up for it.
@Hardlydan That's not what happens to a head when you bury it in the sand.
@wmarybeard Thanks, Mary - very glad you agree.
If, like me, you've heard quite enough about Donald fucking Trump this week, then don't read my Observer column. https://t.co/9Y2CbTHopC
@VonBlade Not this year, I'm afraid.
Am hosting tonight's @haveigotnews (BBC1,9pm) w/ Andy Hamilton, @KirstyWark &amp; regulars. There's NO discussion of the bloody Heathrow runway.
It's the last but one Peep Show ever tonight and Olivia Colman is back. 10pm, Channel 4. #oliviacolmanisback #tenpmchannel4 #things
@willstokes87 Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
In my Observer column this week, Hilary Benn's high-octane reboot of the parable of the Good Samaritan. https://t.co/nhpAnJnO1m
@IamHappyToast That is horrifying.
@CrazyAlify No.
@rufusjones1 @sambaintv @jessearmstrong1 @arobertwebb Thanks Rufus! Very glad you liked it.
@TraceeHenge @frankieboyle No, because I'd feel better about the world if I thought it wasn't true.
@iatrogenesis Yes, of course.
I wish I didn't agree with this. https://t.co/A2ugNjCE1u
@MJPGallagher Thank you! And it annoys me too, to be honest.
@charlieray47 Yes indeed!
@deeferdonk That's actually the name of the episode.
@mrradishhead Thank you - but is it too short?
The ANTEPENULTIMATE EVER episode of Peep Show is on Channel 4 at 10pm tonight! #antepenultimateeverpeepshow
"The rest is legend." The new slogan for Tempur Mattresses or something WORSE? Find out in my Observer column today. https://t.co/bEyyKlZNQq
@ElliottGSpencer Thanks Elliott! I must say, nasty pieces of work though they are, I'll miss them too.
@sideshow_val Yes, replies on here aren't always illuminating. Glad to have clarified.
@Catty84 I think it was Dairylea, but I didn't taste it.
@sideshow_val @robinedds it's not gun-related AT ALL - it's funny because one team is slick &amp; coordinated and the other is waving awkwardly.
@dode969 I'm already on my third.
Thanks to everyone who said they enjoyed last night's Peep Show. If you missed it &amp; own a modern computer, it's here https://t.co/uyDJhRQAhf
@Philippa_Perry We should bring out a disgusting recipe book.
@richardosman Thanks Richard! Very glad indeed that you liked it.
@spacmong Thank #you.
@marcwilson_1981 Thanks! It's a favourite of mine, actually.
Episode 3 of the last series of Peep Show is on TONIGHT, 10pm, C4. I genuinely think that it's #enjoyable but I admit that I am #biased.
@Peter_Rosier Probably, on some level. It's also about #nothavingtoshave. Very glad you liked the book!
@jondrytay Well, quite.
Did you know the Blankety Blank theme was originally written for the film version of 'Watership Down'? Makes sense when you think about it.
@davidrjroy Thanks - and excellent timing... https://t.co/sWeSl8v76e

@Rosie_Paice Hi Rosie! It was 'Much Ado About Nothing', wasn't it? 21 years ago, I believe.
@SirMustard Thanks! Hope you enjoy tonight's.
Episode 2 of the last series of #peepshow is on Channel 4 tonight at 10pm. It contains jokes about sex and central heating.
@LydiaMJones Well, it worked for me. Good luck!
@robdelaney @sambaintv @jessearmstrong1 @arobertwebb Thanks so much! VERY nice of you to say.
@LeoJCarey @thomasbeckett @robthor @arobertwebb You're remembering it now - if only we'd remembered it then.
@Munchious Thank you! What a very nice thing to say.
Thanks so much for all the nice comments about last night's #peepshow. If you missed it, you can now watch it at https://t.co/uyDJhS8b8N.
Right. The first episode of the last series of Peep Show is on Channel 4 tonight at 10pm. I hope you find it VERY AMUSING. #PeepShowDay
@FifeDawg84 Anyone MIGHT piss himself. The question is: will you?

@thefuturebank Thank you! I hope they like it.
@JNRaeside @halbranson That's very funny indeed! Was great to meet you. And thanks again, Julia, for doing a brilliant job yesterday.

@MikeyNo0ms Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@robfnunn The answers are yes and the 11th November.
@Mclacks_ It starts next Wednesday, the 11th.
Thanks, Julia - see you there! https://t.co/dIYV2WsZzF

I think the warmth rating system on T-shirts is too complicated. https://t.co/GYO5TjS3kP
@hugorifkind I agree - it's like fucking spider Christmas.
@slepkane Which is odd because, when we recorded it, I wasn't a dad.
Also, it has now been DECIDED that the LAST series of PEEP SHOW will start on CHANNEL 4 at 10pm on the 11TH NOVEMBER. #capitalsforEMPHASIS
@brnurse Particularly if the 5 of us commit a crime as a gang.

@Jordtb95 Thanks - very glad you approve!
@paubai It is impossible to have enough pens. 'Too many' and 'none' are the only available quantities.
In the last Unbelievable Truth of the series (R4 today 6.30), my wife lies and lies and lies. As do @wiggywalsh, @Kathbum &amp; @SarahMillican75
@densewords That sketch just found its third dimension.
@Notdavidgrant Yes, always.
Tonight's Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30) rejoices in the noises of @SusanCalman, @phlaimeaux, @ArfurSmith &amp; @RonJichardson.
@simonblackwell WOW! Many congratulations, Simon!
@Liverbird4ever Never. And I don't live there now.
@THEAdamLovell You're very kind and very welcome.
@LeoJCarey Thanks Leo - it's a weird happy/sad day.
@Claytoncast Thanks Paul - great to see you last week.
@exitthelemming Thanks Sam - feeling quite nostalgic and old.
@realmatbaynton Thanks so much. Hope you like the last run.
Another new Unbelievable Truth today (R4, 6.30), with @SarahMillican75, @Kathbum, @wiggywalsh &amp; @VictoriaCoren, one of whom is my wife.
@slepkane @MrJamesBachman No one's supposed to know about the return of man-wearing-mask from the wargaming-in-the-woods ep! #avengegerard

On tonight's @WILTY_TV (8.30 BBC1) are @TheRealJackDee, @GabyRoslin, @RomeshRanga &amp; @TinchyStryder. Yes, the old gang's back together again!
@Herne_TheHunter Well it certainly doesn't help.
Other than me, the people talking in it are Miles Jupp, Lloyd Langford, @sarapascoe and @henningwehn.
I forgot to tweet about yesterday's new episode of Unbelievable Truth, but it's now available here: http://t.co/H7jOq0FONu .

@NZSuziq Thanks! Hope you have a good day too.
@SeanHollands Quite a bit - and, to be fair on me, even then I wasn't a financial drain on my mother.
@EmCeeHammock Good work!
@NZSuziq Ah, sorry - I expect it'll get to you eventually.
@DaniiMcDonnelly Thanks!
@oldpicsarchive Either you think that's a particularly harmonious photo or you're missing an 'e'.
On tonight's new @WILTY_TV (BBC1, 8.30) we showcase the physical and vocal talents of @RichardHammond, @judmoo, @TheSeanLock &amp; @Trevornoah.
@Will_Palin What an excellent idea for a festival! Not around tomorrow but wish I could come along.
@LiteraryRambler That sketch is a particular favourite of mine.
@crobertson012 No, but I'm very pleased to hear it now.
@melbennett_ Thanks - hope you like this week's.
@Franc_Ashman Not at all - it was great working with you too.
@quixoticgeek It's caused by yeast or bacteria, according to Wikipedia.
@carmelites_gill It's on the radio.
Tonight's episode of The Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30) will feature noises made by @ArfurSmith, @SusanCalman, @RonJichardson &amp; @phlaimeaux.
@VampireMike2004 Why would you use public transport to stop a bathroom leak?
@adriantoomey Yes, finally!
Even better! https://t.co/65bck0Iuim
WE'RE ON A VAN! @arobertwebb  https://t.co/BwQbRhLggA
On tonight's brand new episode of @WILTY_TV (8.30pm, BBC1) are @rhodgilbertshow, @grimmers, @robdelaney and @ClareBalding. Hope you like it.
@GregorHamill I've no idea, I'm afraid. But I think it's all on 4OD.
A BRAND NEW series of The Unbelievable Truth starts today (6.30, Radio 4). Guests: Miles Jupp, Lloyd Langford, @sarapascoe &amp; @henningwehn.
Not me - the novelist? Good they're 24 hrs. For those nights you need a horse burned and it won't wait till morning. https://t.co/zZCnveytGS
@saltbeefTV Thanks Jeremy - very nice of you to say!
@sikelele Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed it.
@MrNickLawrence Christ! That almost counts as market penetration.
@marie73628378 What the hell is that?!
Tonight's @WILTY_TV (BBC1, 8.30) is very Germainey but equally Jermainey, with Germaine Greer, Jermaine Jenas, @richardosman &amp; @alandavies1.
@Rockerq Have now seen the article you mean - but, no, was nothing to do with me.
@ladyurbanfox It's nothing to do with me.
@kb32904 No, I didn't write it.
@Rockerq You assume wrongly. I don't know what video you mean but I haven't 'authorised' ANY party political video ever.
@Markie_C Thanks! We would have liked to do more - not our decision to stop.
@sigridrg Thanks - very kind of you to say.
@SimonMeacock Likewise - it was a great pleasure.
On tonight's @WILTY_TV (BBC1, 8.30) are @gdavies, @MissAlexjones, @rickedwards1 &amp; @official_jcc. There's also an appearance by a non-human.
@MattWard Thanks - very kind of you to say.
@exitthelemming Yes, the world is suddenly a draughtier place.
Yes indeed - very sad news. He was a lovely man. https://t.co/9FkEQArdt7
@Katt_Hx Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
@TinaTeapot27 Or I could get some monks to illuminate it as a manuscript and post it to Twitter HQ in Rome.
@GuanoLad Such people are the future.
And that tweet had no room for a 'first world problems' hashtag which is, frankly, the pits. #firstworldproblems
It's sadly impossible to say who's on a programme, name it, emphasise it's not a repeat AND actually say anything about it in one tweet.
On tonight's brand new 'Would I Lie To You?' (BBC1, 8.30) are @RealBobMortimer, @GabbyLogan, @SteveBackshall &amp; Katherine Parkinson.
@jdawn1982 For me that is a near-perpetual state.
@Rick_Aspinall You're too kind. Or you're losing your eyesight.
@Mcleod905McLeod Damn! That was an opportunity missed. I used an electric.
@DarthCackett So do I.
A BRAND NEW series of @WILTY_TV starts tonight at 8.30pm on BBC1. Guests are Danny Dyer, @RonJichardson, @joelycett and Moira Stewart.
@jessiep95 God knows. What is and isn't available at any given moment on Netflix is an absolute mystery to me.
@The_Pentatonic Thanks - very glad you liked it!
LAST EVER Peep Show readthrough today. I promise I will shave before we start shooting. http://t.co/T7r6oidoNX
Thanks for all the birthday greetings for yesterday. I had a very nice day involving, among other things, cake, alcohol &amp; Egyptian mummies.
@PattinsonKatie Thanks Katie! We're all very well thanks. Hope everything's good with you.
Now cheaper but less effective as a weapon. https://t.co/ReIIkq8ZIS
@Jonah_davies I think mainly the former.
@Jonah_davies Splendid! Good luck keeping the job.
@GFoxyFowler Thanks so much - that's lovely to hear.
@AFTRebecca Yes! I play a villain.
Sorry for the silence - have been attempting basic parenthood. And many thanks for all the welcome messages for our lovely daughter Barbara.
This is my last Observer column for a bit - back in the autumn - so, as a special treat, I'm being rude about the PM. http://t.co/hfjsJnkP6e
@michaelcollins2 It was 1999, I think.
@RealMattLucas @VictoriaCoren Thanks - and great to see you, Matt. Really enjoyed doing the show with you.
@mehdirhasan Yes - at one point I thought they'd brought Chris Huhne on just to publicly deny him the chance to speak.
@arobertwebb Night night!
@arobertwebb @LeoJCarey It sounds like a cynic's chat-up line.
@RufusHound Good point!
@mehdirhasan Thanks and likewise. Was great fun chatting to you.
@arobertwebb I would join you but it would mean I'd have to get dressed.
@TheSkipjack95 @arobertwebb That takes me back.
Thanks for the nice tweets about C4's election show last night. I'm drunk with tiredness and considering becoming drunk with something else.
@FatuousSunbeam Thank you!
@robdelaney I doubt it. There's something about my gaze that tends to stop that sort of thing from happening.
I'M GOING TO BE ON TV WITH JEREMY PAXMAN FOR 9 HOURS!!! I literally once dreamt that happened. At the end, the Queen turned up. #AltElection
@shorez Thanks! You're the only person I've noticed noticing that joke.
@mwlinder99 'Decline and Fall' is my favourite.
@AlisonRhiannon Happy Birthday! Hope you have a splendid day. @93_beatrice
@Bo0k_Worm That's by @david_mitchell, not me.
Boeing's new 'upright sleeping system' doesn't look that comfy. http://t.co/WIrFTUlphO
@nixon_danny I don't think it really is. I think it's more renowned for making stuff like iPhones that the West can't get enough of.
Nice one. https://t.co/uhHEnfsA9r
Ah! That makes sense. I'm glad to hear it. I understand the need for vans. https://t.co/KFaPAt5DHp
I think I just heard an advert on the radio for sculpted cheese. For parties. So they smell of feet. Is this a thing or am I still asleep?
@_Bazarati Do you mean this one? https://t.co/ZITmof7vxT
In the Observer today, a Frenchman says civilisation is about to end and I find it relaxing. #soothingfatalism http://t.co/DUYd47wLOZ
@austinhutchison You're welcome - very glad you enjoyed it.
@NezihBouali I've since moved house - but no, I never pressed it.
This is pretty shocking. http://t.co/uSkMsi46jM
@andyglynn1988 Thanks! Glad you're enjoying it.
@ZxGrundy @holbyeducated Good luck and have a great day!
@LilJerseyDevil We're actually filming over the summer and then it should be on in the autumn.
@McLeanAmy Thanks - very glad you liked it.
@hughlaurie Thank you!
My Observer column today is about what actually happens when a politician gives a straight answer for once. http://t.co/d8yZfXqwQM
@danielmaier Yes, that's precisely the problem. They're not the easiest people to feel sorry for but it's very unfair on them.
@DMinghella I suspect we're both hoping in vain!
@Baddiel Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@RBAMX Thanks - but I think you mean @david_mitchell.
@DMinghella Thanks for an interesting blog - not totally sure that Gogglebox is "unaffected public reaction" though!
@MaxyPiz This autumn.
@bigbriancraig78 I don't think that's really workable.
@peterbarnes_ It would be such a loss to innuendo if it didn't.
@louisbwest @charltonbrooker It's just the way his trousers hang.
@charltonbrooker As the bishop said to the actress...
'Let people underestimate me' works much better. #BattleForNumber10
And I certainly wouldn't want to see the accompanying photo shoot. #BattleForNumber10
I'm not sure that 'Hell yes I'm tough enough' is the right catchphrase for Ed. #BattleForNumber10
If Kay Burley wanted to avoid politicians' answers, they needed to book different guests. #BattleForNumber10
Hand in pocket, legs apart - they've worked on that stance. #BattleForNumber10
Nice plug for the Sky News app - well done Kay Burley! #BattleForNumber10
'Do you know and you're not telling us or do you not know?' - i.e. are you a liar or an idiot? #BattleForNumber10
It seems David Cameron has been called into the headmaster's office for a serious talking to. #BattleForNumber10
@philosophic_lee I meant qualitatively and am dismayed at the accidental ambiguity.
The 1st Ever Comic Relief Art Auction ends this Sunday. Art by Quentin Blake, Gerald Scarfe, Aardman &amp; more. Bid now! http://t.co/UiGopgPjMU
I'm on tonight's @JonathanRShow (ITV, 9.25pm) with more interesting guests @Russellcrowe, @ElizabethHurley, Lily James, @nilerodgers &amp; Chic.
@NickSlidel Out of those two options, I'm afraid the latter is more likely.
@SortYourselfOut So did I - but apparently that's not how the scientists say it.
Click here to watch an exhausted @radioleary attempt to dance the world into being a better place: http://t.co/tFdTQp0iRu. @rednoseday
@Postcards_Gods @arobertwebb I suspect I've got a couple of hundred copies somewhere in the attic.
In today's Observer, I'm looking at all the exciting policies the government has come up with to attract evil voters. http://t.co/XC5Nsmbl8t
@cakeorpiedotorg Yes, we're the only firm that does the plastering before the building.
I'm taking part in a special @rednoseday themed #BBCLooseEnds today at 6.15, R4. There are songs, dances and cakes, not all of them audible.
@artevie203 They've got the beard, but seem to have left out the moustache.
@Nat_Cassidy Remarkable indeed! And somehow I quite fancy buying a massive green smock.
Interested in sport? Read this about what @thefridgeman's charity does, while tennis's governing body stands idly by. http://t.co/QUvUffnOyO
@thewendybain I totally share your priorities. I will NEVER make another pavlova. But I always quite fancy a pork pie.
@MCabournSmith @slepkane But armadillos and rockets are so mouth-watering!
@AdamFunYo Thanks! And you're welcome!
@thewendybain I must say, they were genuinely quite edible.
@slepkane Grey is the most delicious colour! Thanks, Simon.
Thanks for the nice tweets about #GBBOComicrelief. If you were inspired/offended, get a kit &amp; hold your own bake sale http://t.co/lhVwx5RVrU
Tonight I'm on the Great @BritishBakeOff for @comicrelief (#GBBOComicRelief) w/ @jameelajamil, @SarahBrownUK &amp; @michaelsheen. 8pm, @BBCOne.
@eddie75n No problem!
@DadSearle Quite! It's very annoying.
@kinita_s I had a rocky patch before I got into panel shows.
@kathredmond1 Thanks!
@PatSouthwood Good idea! St Paul's Cathedral would make a spectacular All Bar One.
@Ohknow @guardian That's almost exactly the opposite of what I'm saying.
@roywoolmans Only the poor can complain about poverty? That's a great way of silencing many influential advocates of wealth redistribution.
@colinthomas1961 So you think it's hypocritical to regret poverty unless you are yourself poor? That's a coherent view, but quite extreme.
@eddie75n Actually that wasn't my question - that's just the headline. But, yes, those groups can also complain.
@caitlinmoran Ah, sorry about that. My enclave says: leave it a week and write it anyway; her last column was on a subject from July 2014.
@giles_fraser Many thanks. Very glad you approve!
@caitlinmoran Thanks! Very nice of you to say. Glad you liked it.
@NadineDorriesMP Thanks - but any previous omissions surely can't be a fault in this letter.
My Observer column today is about bishops and badgers, and the very different ways they both get a hard time. http://t.co/vUdtsEDTyH
@iam_smithers @WILTY_TV No, it was edited blindfold.
It is 100% UNSEEN MATERIAL. At the moment. By 8 o'clock it'll be 100% seen. I hope. @WILTY_TV
Slightly randomly, there is a brand new compilation episode of 'Would I Lie To You?' on BBC1 at 7.30 tonight. @WILTY_TV
Here's a Comic Relief video which shows you how to use a pun on the word "shit" to do good. https://t.co/z846eMbvG0 @rednoseday @comicrelief
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about just how sexy the rest of the world finds the British. http://t.co/7rZiyNOyy8
I'm on @TheLastLeg tonight at 10pm on @Channel4. And look - they've even made a special electric poster! http://t.co/HqJ70J9wtM
@thewendybain I don't think many of them would be broadcastable.
@MimsiMcFetridge Excellent suggestion.
@HelzBellz77 Thanks! Very glad my short walk is making your enormous delivery round go quicker.
Join @sanditoksvig, @ArfurSmith, @GraemeGarden1 &amp; @SarahMillican75 today for the last batch of Unbelievable Truths for this series, R4 6.30.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about the simple pleasures of outrage and disapproval. http://t.co/jplV14P6AK
@ProfBrianCox Thanks very much! Glad you liked it.
@jondrytay @PCollinsTimes @LeoJCarey @arobertwebb They were great lyrics, though my main memory of them is forgetting them on the 1st night.
More Unbelievable Truth-telling, as well as plausible lying, from Lloyd Langford, @joshwiddicombe, @SusanCalman &amp; @phlaimeaux today 6.30 R4.
@djdaverose Thanks! Very glad to hear it.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about how London has got something in its Eye. http://t.co/pZE54V8dqu
I'm in a brand new episode of #QI tonight at 10pm on BBC2. Here's a little bit of it in advance: http://t.co/aYsrfh51L3
@craigmelson This autumn.
@AditiMukund @moon_rover I think you meant to direct your tweets to @david_mitchell rather than me.
@OscarsDen You're very welcome!
@sambaintv @arobertwebb @BridgetChristie What impresses me is that they don't let it undermine the dignity of the sport.
On Unbelievable Truth today (R4, 6.30) are @MrEdByrne, @henningwehn, @wiggywalsh &amp; @richardosman. Tune in if you think it's funny to lie.
@Mrspricetom That sounds awkward...
My Observer/@ObsNewReview article today is about the embarrassment time-bomb in all of our trousers. http://t.co/iZaZzHCZcc
@MarkThefunk Thanks! And, yes, we're filming one next month.
RT @jonlaurence: the last five years in politics in Peep Show quotes. http://t.co/Mty1MdZYP8 cc @jessearmstrong1 @sambaintv
@mauricegran Glad to hear they're doing their bit towards the internet's work destroying mission.
@GazWeetman Yes, very glad to see someone's done that!
@iddlw Well there's still the closing credits to come. Maybe I should add a 'nearly'?
RT @stjohnambulance: What does a jelly baby &amp; a marble have in common? Watch this to find out: #TheChokeables https://t.co/UXQJfkv2dO
Terrific line-up of panellists on tonight's Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30pm): @sanditoksvig, @ArfurSmith, @GraemeGarden1 &amp; @SarahMillican75!
I'm on @FrankOnTheRadio's The Rest Is History tonight at 7.15 on Radio 4. It will contain historical facts and futuristic jokes. Maybe.
In the Observer/@ObsNewReview today, my new NHS helpline that'll solve all of A&amp;E's problems. http://t.co/7Tu27AY0eV
@EmmaTofi Yes, I did go back for the goldfish.
I'm on 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown tonight (C4, 9pm). Do tune in for humour and anagrams, with the occasional humorous anagram.
@JRMurray26 Thanks! Sorry for messing up the page.
@swhittz Hope you enjoy it!
Change of change of plan: the advertised new ep of "Would I Lie To You?" WILL be broadcast tonight on BBC1 after all. So that's in 30 mins.
Apologies, that episode of WILTY is NOT now going to be on tonight. It'll be shown at some future point (don't know when at the moment).
A BRAND NEW ep of Would I Lie To You is on tonight, 8pm BBC1 w/ June Brown, Adrian Chiles, @seannwalsh &amp; @WeeMissBea: http://t.co/PuSozMaJZR
@najibbers It should be on this autumn.
By which I mean: ow.
How often does James Bond, when leaning over to stop grease dripping onto his shirt from a tepid roast potato, bang his head on a cupboard?
Some brand new Unbelievable Truths for a brand new year: tonight, 6.30, R4 with @richardosman, @wiggywalsh, @MrEdByrne &amp; @henningwehn.
@TeganxKitty I can only apologise.
@debbiecl8 Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
@trm234567 Hmm. I mean, obviously we haven't been paid at all. The 'creative' responsible might consider a change of job title.
@kerryanneg123 Thanks - glad you like it!
@Blackman_FTW Very glad to hear it - thank you. And, yes, your recollection is correct.
@Keith_CCWeekly Thanks. And yes, it certainly got circulated - largely by people who thought it was real.
@raywolst Well I'm only a grumpy middle-aged man.
@Stu13Wal Thanks - glad you agree.
@bracealmighty Well, you could always buy the board game.
@cockney_white Thanks - yes, that is quite annoying.
A brand new series of Unbelievable Truth starts today at 6.30 on R4. Guests are @phlaimeaux, @joshwiddicombe, Lloyd Langford &amp; @SusanCalman.
@DavidAtkins42 Hope you enjoy it!
@LucienGreen Thanks very much - it's kind of you to say. Glad you liked it.
@BlockTrade_io Thanks! Glad you liked it.
In the Observer/@ObsNewReview today, I look back on some of the quirkier news stories of 2015. #notatypo http://t.co/cwhaldkTid
I'm on C4's Big Fat Quiz of the Year @ 9 w/ @jimmycarr, @RichardAyoade, @SarahMillican75, @kevinbridges86, @MickyF_Official &amp; @OfficialMelB.
@lenabellina Hi Lena! Nice to see you on here! Hope you and your children enjoy the show - and Happy Christmas to you too!
Tonight at 8.30pm on BBC1, I play a moustachioed busybody trying to ruin lovable Professor Branestawm's life. Merry Christmas!
@FellsideDave Sadly, I don't think there is at the moment - is there, @garethmammal?
@GuanoLad 29th December.
But for those who love a bit of festive mendacity, do tune in to watch Ray Winstone, @joshwiddicombe, @RachelRileyRR &amp; Ricky Tomlinson.
Tired of all the Christmas lies? Then DON'T watch "Would I Lie To You At Christmas", tonight at 8.30pm on BBC1.
I'm on a brand new episode of QI tonight (10pm, BBC2). The other irregulars are @jimmycarr and @RonniAncona. Clip: http://t.co/Nd6vyjG65w
@d72e6aadf97f427 Yes, once more. Next autumn.
@Arfa_Maq Glad you're enjoying it.
@joncle I think the new series starts going out on the 29th of this month.
@jinnygo76 Thanks - very nice of you to say. Hope you enjoy the book.
@elethomiel Glad to head it - though I must admit my fear was more of being penless in a crisis than doing a murder.
@jinnygo76 Excellent - hope it works out.
@kimundystylist That's what I thought - but lots of people think it's more Canadian.
@peterjwest I'm very happy to record one. Ask @FaberBooks.
@jinnygo76 I don't know. Online I expect you can. Assuming you mean South Korea.
@trixielovescc I've always thought I'd like it there.
@DavidJames1997 Happy Birthday! @morgancorrisss
@ChristopherWa58 No, but it's pretty close to Wordwang.
@Phaltron Sadly it's not up to us, but we hope it will too.
@helmetfreedom Thanks! Glad you're enjoying it.
.@Fascinatingpics I'm afraid that's not real. It's a joke from a comedy book @arobertwebb and I wrote in 2009. http://t.co/sGnkukovaN
@joeisnotfestive Do a show on the Edinburgh Fringe is my only solid piece of advice, other than trying to make it funny obviously.Good luck!
@SabsChance Be thankful you can't smell it.
@jondrytay Yeah, but you've got to admit that they've COMPLETELY got their heads round chronological order.
Very good article by @Baddiel on how antisemitism gets viewed as racism-lite. http://t.co/MY0b2OQfsP
@Baddiel Thanks! Hadn't seen your piece before. It's very interesting and wise - and a good read.
@monstroso Very much so.
@keiththecamel Thanks Keith. Very glad you thought so.
@adoptaword History, probably. Or a fictional murder.
@alanmills405 Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@andrewrhirst Thanks! Glad it works with or without the whisky.
@WstonesRomford I'm reading The Third Policeman by Flann O'Brien - on @monstroso's recommendation.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about two of my least favourite things: football and fashion. http://t.co/YUoaoO8Dim
@mrs_macleod @FaberBooks There's probably a book in that as well.
Marketing idea for clothing companies: pay impecunious Yewtree suspects to wear their rivals' brands when going in and out of court.
@ShayleeOades Beats me. I've got two middle names, but neither of them start with L.
@cuckooqueen Yes indeed. If you contact Michele Milburn @MilburnBrowning, she'd be able to organise that.
@ShedtoMars @JohnFinnemore You're thinking of Soapboxes which John co-wrote but aren't in book. It's all Observer pieces which I wrote solo.
@BigSheffLove That's nice! I hope you're right.
@pauljmharper Very glad you're enjoying it.
@Guardian_Bkshop I just retweeted that but the link doesn't work - so I'm unretweeting it.
@densewords Well spotted! Should have checked that.
@LocalSCambridge @ToppingsEly Thanks! Glad you enjoyed the evening - so did I.
@andrewrhirst Thanks! I'm honoured to be accompanied by such a classy drink.

@ToppingsEly Thanks for organising such a terrific event. I really enjoyed myself.
I'll be signing books @WaterstonesPicc's Christmas Evening tonight from 6. The shop will be packed with PIES, WINE and AUTHORS.
Off to East Anglia for a book signing @WaterstonesCamb at 3.30, then a Q&amp;A at Ely Cathedral at 7.30 http://t.co/o7Xw86ZcMQ. Do come along.

@HowToSpeakMoney She's done well to keep the weight on with TB!
I'm hosting tonight's @haveigotnews (BBC1, 9pm), with guests @sarajcox and @AlanJohnsonMP.
@trickbo Oh I do hope not.
@alexjamesbailey Very glad you like it!
@AislinnSmith_ Happy birthday! @superflygal747
@AngelaJWhite @dianemitchell3 @CR_UK Good luck!

@RabbiJoshy I'm afraid either I'm going mad or that wasn't me. Either way, sorry.
@GregsonDave Just watched it - well done! I hardly knew any of them.
@RabbiJoshy Don't know what you're on about - sorry.
@oldabingdonians Thanks for having me. Was nice to be back.
@MostlyReading You're welcome - it was a very enjoyable event.
@WaterstonesOxf You're welcome - thanks for having me!
@stupler Hope you enjoy it!
On my way to Oxfordshire for book events in Chipping Norton and Abingdon, plus a signing in Oxford  @WaterstonesOxf at 4pm. Do come along!
@hattylouise @WaterstonesOxf Not only will I sign both, if required I will sign both twice.
@GreavesZ @WaterstonesOxf No - tomorrow!
Still a few tickets left for tomorrow's event in central London. I'll be talking to @jnmulholland about my book. https://t.co/nlcSGbBj1L
@GreavesZ @WaterstonesOxf That's not today though - that's on Thursday.
@waterstonesyeo @laurarawlings @YeovilLitFest You're very welcome - thanks for having me. Was great fun.
@iangw64 Quite.
@SteveMPledger @TauntonLitFest See you tomorrow!
@status_zer0 I'm glad you enjoyed it - but sorry you're having a tough time.
@JeffNBrown Oh yes - more now than ever.
@abjsouth Not at all. Glad you had a nice time. So did I.
@rosie_winch Thanks - hope you like it.
@DimpleMagician Was very nice to meet you - excellent trick too!
@laurarawlings Thanks for your excellent interviewing! Was great to meet you.
On my way to the Yeovil Literary Festival for this: http://t.co/zV1f3mG42n . See you later (if I'm seeing you later).
@joeisnotswaggy Yes.
@eric144144 I don't want to keep them secret. I want to proclaim from the rooftops my view that everyone shouldn't be constantly watched.
@jellybbe Not in the next few weeks sadly, but planning more for next year so maybe then.
@jonronson Exactly. We mustn't be afraid of innovative ideas wherever they come from. They could put it in Lynx.
In the Observer today, I'm shocked by Theresa May's view that we should all suffer in order to be easier to spy on. http://t.co/pwCVVGARV5
@LittleFishery @charlie_rsmith @guardian Not a day to scrutinise government?! You've got a weird idea of what they were fighting for.
@Helen_ECW You're welcome! Thanks for having me.
@Simon_Earle The more people who think that, the better.
@handronicus101 But probably not eyeshot.
@AidanBruce That is certainly part of it.
@tombenj97 He is also splendid.
@Caitlin_MeAtSix Find something that annoys you and say why.
@LSchlotel Out OF context, I should have typed.
@BlaineFeliciano Thanks! Hope you enjoy the new one too.
@RosieMuggle That sounds dramatic! Glad you're okay.
@LSchlotel That's as gratifying for me as it must be annoying for your husband - a phrase not to be taken out if context.
@tombenj97 Yes I do - and I'm a big fan of Patrick Troughton.
If you fancy following me round with your ears this morning, I'm going to be on @DannyBaker5Live and then @grahnort on @BBCRadio2.
@TauntonsToneFM @TauntonLitFest @TauntonTIC @VisitSomerset Thanks! I'm looking forward to it too.
@richardosman That sounds like a quote for the paperback.
@richardosman Well, I did regretfully allow them to deploy my lothario reputation as part of the marketing strategy.
@Craig_Jarrett Not this month but might be doing some more events next year so maybe then.
@ludicrousitys Haven't recorded one yet, but would be up for it. @FaberBooks are the people to ask.
@ReeceShearsmith Yes, I've been trying to keep it quiet.
Doing my first live book events in Yeovil on Sunday and Taunton on Monday. Tickets here http://t.co/zV1f3mG42n &amp; here http://t.co/u2YixMpT74
@hivestores Thanks so much for that. All the best.
@F0URT3N Beautiful!
@hivestores You're very welcome! BTW just noticed the 'Also by David Mitchell' bit is all books by the novelist, not me.Can that be altered?
@stonecypher @The_Bookshop And he's stolen my favourite outfit!
@Matthew_Wright Thanks! And yes indeed - on really bad days I sing along with my iPod.
@Matthew_Wright Whoops! Sorry, must have been shouting my head off as usual. I'd be an easy target for GCHQ.
@LindseyCBowers You're very welcome. Nice to meet you too. Thanks for having me on the show.
I'm on @itvthismorning at 10.50 today. Tune in for live footage of how much my beard has grown overnight. #thinkingaboutitonlymakesitlonger
Going on The One Show in just over half an hour to talk about "Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse". Which, as I keep saying, is a book.
@georginagodwin Thanks! Was great to meet you and thanks for an enjoyable interview.
@victorybyname Thanks! Glad I sounded vaguely coherent.
@activedan @johnmurrayshow @rte Thanks! I enjoyed coming on the show.
@The_Mole_UK I don't think it would be fun for me.
Bloody hell! That's in 45 minutes! http://t.co/MTFW5U43gD
@MarkCrampton1 Thank you! I'm very glad you liked it. Hope you enjoy the book.
@mrianleslie Thanks Ian - glad you liked it.
@Philfy1 It's out next week so should be in bookshops from Thursday.
In today's @ObsNewReview, instead of a column, an extract from my new book, 'Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse'. http://t.co/OLc6APDyUP
@BillHuts I think there is a link: the rage whipped up over Sachsgate was welcome distraction from fear of economic collapse.
@MattWilliams84 I must say I enjoyed the dog burning. #phrasesnottobetakenoutofcontext
@ReeceShearsmith Very nice to see you too! Also, I think we made excellent progress on putting the world to rights.
@neilbd79 You are right - I'm definitely there on the 22nd. See you then! @dlwp_boxoffice
Not sure you quite got Jez's hairdo. Otherwise impeccable RT @bandsandacid: we dressed up as Jez &amp; Mark for Halloween http://t.co/ZKOK4jnGIu
Good work! RT @RubyTCMartin: it's the surprising halloween adventures of Sir Digby Chicken Caesar (ft. @Ginger_Pig) http://t.co/oTXbcjr4SU
Is it just me, or do I sit a bit funny? MT @ObsNewReview: Sneak peek at this Sunday's Observer New Review cover. http://t.co/S8HAXsh7JC
On 12th Nov, I'm doing a book event in central London with Observer editor @jnmulholland. Tickets here: https://t.co/nlcSGbBj1L
I'm talking about my book "Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse" in Taunton at lunchtime on 10th Nov. Tickets here: http://t.co/u2YixMpT74
@lizzie_bourne V glad you liked show, but sorry to hear audience wasn't better treated. Will make enquiries. cc @BBCRadio4 @UnbelieveTruth
@_MeiChumi_ I think they start going out at the end of December.
@gpcroft Maybe at some point, but not yet.
@SarahMillican75 Thanks so much for coming on the show - you were brilliant, as ever.
If you're in Yeovil on 9th Nov, so am I! In fact, I'm going to be there whether or not you are. Tickets here: http://t.co/zV1f3mG42n
@FionaClareWhite Happy 30th Birthday!
@PlanetVictoria Thanks! You know my view: all wine is excellent.
@FAPercival I imagine I'd like it very much - I think champagne's great!
@mmonogram Thanks Swampy! What a very nice compliment!
Disappointed by the taste of your champagne? Really? By the taste? Oh, come off it! My Observer/@ObsNewReview column: http://t.co/6t7k1rSWVq
@SumiDavid We hope so, but nothing confirmed as yet.
@miko111973 I know. Was lucky to get away with it. Should have been 'rear-view'.
@believinginmore Well, it's not a novel.
There's one more ep in this series, and a compilation of unseen material, which will probably go out early 2015, &amp; a 2014 Christmas special.
On tonight's Would I Lie To You? (BBC1, 8.30) are Jo Brand, @paulfoot @Ray_Mears and @Roisinconaty. That's the last one for a bit.
@Lang44 Yes.
@sam_bambs Thanks! Very glad you approve.
@LaraSawalha Please accept my slightly less impersonal thanks.
@krisjones1 I'm glad - and grateful for your gratitude.
@Assiepattle Sorry for getting the terminology wrong. It must be because I really live on London.
I don't really live on Orkney. Although I'd very much like to visit. After which, I will consider living there.
I'm aware of, but not responsible for, the events' deficiency of geographical spread. It's particularly annoying for me as I live on Orkney.
@michaelfromuk I think 'myew' sounds more literary.
@rlmays Don't think so, no.
I'm doing some events where I talk about it and answer questions. Here's a list, with links to how to get tickets: http://t.co/L0GpG1RIlt
My new book "Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse" (I'm pronouncing the acronym "tayomew") is published on 6th Nov. http://t.co/L0GpG1RIlt
@JolyonRubs Very nice to meet you too!
@mat_hil @richardosman I genuinely think it's a decent system.
@KatyHkm789 It perfectly captures my wasp waist and no arms.
@eloiseiscool Thanks and hello!
On today's Would I Lie To You (BBC1, 8.30) are @richardosman, @jupitusphillip, @CHIMPSINSOCKS, @GarethMalone &amp; @gdavies standing in for Lee.
@TheSilvaLining Not really, I'm afraid. I suppose they thought it was vaguely appropriate to the column.
@TheSilvaLining That headline on an old column? Subs write headlines, but must be ref to that lyric, though Banarama surely didn't coin it?
@nickyjtaylor Thanks! Very glad you like it.
@Webtrate Okay - fair enough!
@Belgian_Wafflez Thank you - very glad you liked it!
@philwill Thanks! Glad you liked it. It was written by @tobydavies.
@Mirthematician I haven't recorded one yet. I might suggest it to the publishers.
@SweetSoubrette That's by @david_mitchell, not me.
@kayleighknott It's the vodka.
@Traveloz67 Over here, series 8 is currently being broadcast.
@rjblaskiewicz I'm pretty sure that having me in the room is bad feng shui.
@delshaffer We'll be shooting it next summer.
@MikeyandMrCroft Thanks!
@Wilfreds_Monkey Really? The world is worse than I thought.
@TelFirth No, thankfully my demonstration confines itself to the metaphorical.
@Stylebug1 Everything? Even kidneys?
@Morg27Stevens Thanks for taking the bullet.
@Webtrate Sorry, but I wasn't really meaning it to be a critique of competing apps - just a column about a story I'd read in the paper.
@harris20_trevor Yes, shit is very easy word to sp/mell. Although I'm sometimes tempted to give it a double 't'.
@danielwells1980 Superb.
In my Observer column today I demonstrate that, verbally as well as literally, diarrhoea is worse than constipation. http://t.co/7PtLc4Pfcs
On @WILTY_TV today (BBC1, 8.30) are people like @IMKellyHoppen, @rhodgilbertshow, @carolvorders &amp; @Halcruttenden. Exactly like them in fact.
This is wise and moving. RT @arobertwebb: By me, quite a lot more personal than usual. Masculinity &amp; how to avoid it. http://t.co/lf3HOktR97
I'm on #Crackanory tonight at 10pm on @Join_Dave, reading a terrific story written by @tobydavies. http://t.co/lxcwY3pHHV
My Observer column today gets annoyed at private schools that get annoyed at people getting annoyed at them. http://t.co/SssdI9Z6jC
@SylviaBevan I'm on it!
@Pussycat777 Not a hat - a halo.
@Aubs_396 Many happy returns!
Here's who's on Would I Lie To You? (at 8.30, BBC1). The photographer lied to us about the tightness of the frame. http://t.co/vAEuVhApfj
New series of QI starts tonight 10pm BBC2. I'm on it later in the run but do watch from the start or YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND THE PLOT. #qiplot
@sbkaufman That's @david_mitchell, not me.
@civilianreader Many thanks for the very nice review. I'm glad you enjoyed the book.
In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today, I reflect on how money is an imperfect means of romantic communication. http://t.co/ZaluLBRxEw
On tonight's Would I Lie To You (BBC1, 8.30pm) are Mel Giedroyc, @RealBobMortimer, @KianEganWL and @adilray. Hope you find it enjoyable.
@biddlybiddly I'm very glad you liked it - thanks very much!
@tdains01 Thanks! Very nice of you to say!
@prajeshs360 Before it does, in fact. We're recording a new run of UT in the next month.
Using the climate change summit as an excuse to repost a SoapBox I did on that subject. (Old version had bit missing) http://t.co/UaiNcuFdb4
@AndreaFaulds @GaspardWinckler @deirdrerusling Not necessarily. People interested in Attlee do. I'm interested in Churchill &amp; I'm not a Tory
@BAbooksellers Thanks so much for having me. It was great fun.
Nice RT @GaspardWinckler Somehow this, from my wonderful girlfriend @deirdrerusling's Google TV, makes perfect sense. http://t.co/RjKyX62LS8
@jondrytay @MrJamesBachman And to think people say that undergraduate comedy lacks edge!
@singers888 Happy 40th birthday! @SammieSingfield
@HMaskell Very glad you like it!
Why not have Shreddies for lunch? RT @WILTY_TV: Missed last night's WILTY? Why not enjoy it with your Shreddies here: http://t.co/slMprgIb4s
On tonight's brand new Would I Lie To You, please enjoy @BrunoTonioli, @KirstyWark, @AdamBuxton &amp; @robbeckettcomic. It's on BBC1 at 8.30pm.
@Kellylexy Happy birthday! @koptommo15
@Marc_Allum Very nice to meet you too - and good luck with the book.
On the subject of the #indyref, I must say that I thought this was well said: https://t.co/oqAwZiOHqc
In the Observer/@ObsNewReview today: My Sex Tape Hell - I tell all. #MSTHITA http://t.co/5EZ8suHZDU
@jameslatham Well maybe now I will.
Catch it NOW, or at some point over the next ten years on Dave. @WILTY_TV
A BRAND NEW series of Would I Lie To You? starts tonight, 8.30, BBC1. Guests: @ClaudiaWinkle, @SteveJones, Fiona Bruce &amp; @MickyF_Official.
@davidkirkland02 Yes, it's here: http://t.co/2qzxtCsmwA .
@BirdNick You're welcome - very glad you liked it.
@mauricegran Thanks! Was very nice to meet you.
@RishiManhas It starts a week today.
I'm on 8 Out Of Ten Cats Does Countdown at 9pm on Channel 4 tonight. It turns out I'm not very good at anagrams or arithmetic.
@david0974 She's sitting next to me and she says I'm right. I agree with her.
@SPWright1975 You're welcome - glad they helped. Get well soon.
@Natalytwenty That book was actually written by @david_mitchell, not me.
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today calls for the democratisation of branding. #stopinexplicablepicturesoncrisps http://t.co/RbJ46bJl3A
@olivong Situation was just one series and it was five years before Look started.
@Jools_Orca You know a dolphin didn't really die, right? In Fawlty Towers' The Kipper &amp; the Corpse a HUMAN dies and that's definitely funny.
Saw Inbetweeners 2 over the weekend. It's hilarious. Loads of splendidly disgusting jokes but with its heart completely in the right place.
@wdavid78 Thanks! And you're welcome.
@Bigstrongmo I'm afraid you'd have to read the column to find out.
@Mr_CTW Good luck and congratulations to Daz!

At 11 o'clock tonight, I'm on @Baddiel's new Radio 4 show Don't Make Me Laugh. It's a lovely format. #AccidentalPartridge
@PinkBeth86 It's reassuring to hear I'm not alone.
@Mahaloth Thanks! Nice of you to say.
@Mahaloth Strictly speaking it's the Observer - but no, I'm off for a few weeks.
@feefeeonly Hope you enjoy it as much as the view.
@danchapman3299 Thanks! Glad you liked it.
@EddHunt1 No idea, I'm afraid. That's not the sort of thing I get consulted about. But I will try and encourage it to happen.
@RosieDoyle Thank you! Very glad you liked it.
@xorganoid Next year!
@ianto007 I thought it was a pretty well constructed narrative, actually.
@Euansmummy Congratulations, Thomas and Kathryn - and best of luck for the future!
My Observer/@ObsNewReview column today is about the dangers of thinking things have been made safe. http://t.co/F6R43iexiW
I've got a book out in November so I'll be doing some normal book events, that's all. #notastanduptour #notanaudiencewith
Please ignore reports on @chortle &amp; @guardian about my "forthcoming stand-up tour" this autumn. I'm not doing one! Crossed wires somewhere.
@IainLatty Do send them my congratulations. Hope they have an amazing day.
@DanThomasUK @wandsworthnews Indeed they did.
Hear hear! RT @VictoriaCoren: Fantastic day in beautiful Llangollen, thanks to everyone at the Fringe for being so friendly and fun.
@Jaffeandneale 10th September? I think you may mean @david_mitchell, not me.
@MrLazyEyes Yes, I voiced it.
@GazWeetman Thanks! Glad you liked it. All good with me, thanks. Hope same goes for you.

@RobertMacIntyr1 It was not out of choice.
I'm on tonight's News Quiz (R4, 6.30) with Andy Hamilton, @RebeccaFront, @JeremyJHardy, @nagbag and @sanditoksvig. #radioworksoutdoors
@CheriClarkin He also appears to have been an early winner of the Wimbledon Ladies' Singles Championship.
Thanks very much for all the 'Happy Birthday' tweets on Monday. I was 40 then but, according to scientists, I am already EVEN OLDER.
@Kate_Murphy_ I must say I miss them.
@meegan_eliza Thank you!
@NeilRamjee 50!?
@Mirthematician Good work!
@Dickyboy1999 I was in TWO pubs that day - but they were both excellent.
@ThatMrStirling I STILL haven't seen it. But I'd be very surprised if the Vanish advertising team aren't scrupulously original.
@beabrown94 I think you mean @david_mitchell.
@MundaneJabs Thank you - very glad you liked it.
@JillWagener Thanks!
@pauljbyrne We're recording more in the autumn, so should be out not long after that.
@paulhutty @StephenMulhern Well remembered!

@SSandAGtoWed Congratulations and good luck! Hope you have a wonderful day.
@razormind Yes, sorry - it's a throwback to when I first joined Twitter in order to supplant an impersonator.
@FolliesPast Thanks - that's very funny.
@callum_haymes Won't be shooting till next year.
@llr517 Never. I've moved out now.
@ChuckieGinger I'm sorry I didn't too - what an excellent heckle!
@sireevesy Fair enough!
@jennylgray2112 Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed it.
@sireevesy Excellent! Still a fan or has your enthusiasm waned?
@MundaneJabs Very glad you like it and that it complemented the view.
@faycass Don't worry about it! Was entirely in the spirit of the occasion.
@sireevesy Yes I do remember! Who were you a fan of? #shouldbewhombutwouldsoundtwatty
@neuropolitique No - though I'd be an obvious choice for the face of football betting.
@iankelly1889 I don't hate him - I think he's funny.
@I_am_Orpheus Yes, it's free.

@jondrytay @merseytart I'm not sure trust is the right thing to feel about any pub. But I bet there are loads of flat roofed carveries.
@camdenguides Hello!
@intrepidslug That is the best kind of insult. And there's always the chance they get educated into understanding it in future years.
@brendaepiper Thanks! That would be a great quote for the cover.
@soggyoldsock I'm pretty sure I'm not.
In today's Observer, I anticipate the relaxing powerlessness I'll feel in a car with no steering-wheel. #whoopsapoem http://t.co/XEoGYerFgl
@dickmagician You're welcome - was fun. And well done on a terrific script.
@Elinsmulan Thank you! How nice of you to say - very glad you liked it.
@Mic_jpm Haven't seen it but you're not the first to say that. Must be a coincidence though as advertisers rigorously insist on originality.

@PhilStephens18 Thanks! Very glad you like it. But most credit should go to @sambaintv and @jessearmstrong1.
Saw @Baddiel's 'Fame - Not the Musical' yesterday. It's hilarious AND interesting. Current run ends tonight but do catch it if on again.
@casfosteractres Thanks! Very glad you like it.
@isssyselby In my defence, I am wearing mine while playing a fictional character.
@SarahMillican75 Very well said.
@TheColinLane Cheers Colin - very nice to meet you.
@zz9zsa I can only apologise.
@mrjohnofarrell It's the months of line learning and rehearsal, plus the regional tour.
Then @SusanCalman and I will be rushing round to BBC1 to be in "Have I Got a Bit More News For You" at 10.40.
Last in the current series of Unbelievable Truth is on R4 at 6.30 today, featuring Miles Jupp, Phill Jupitus, @thefridgeman &amp; @SusanCalman.
@KarlosBanderes Thanks! I'm very glad you enjoyed it.
@rufusjones1 Thanks Rufus - very nice of you to say. God bless your bias.
I'm hosting tonight's 'Have I Got News For You', with @SusanCalman and Andy Hamilton as well as the regulars, at 9pm on BBC1. #HIGNFY
On R4 at 6.30, Unbelievable Truth boasts Phill Jupitus, Miles Jupp, @thefridgeman &amp; @SusanCalman. May the 5th be with you. #fightpunpedantry
@sirdigby13 Thanks! We hope to do so.
@JoshIs So I hear, but sadly that wasn't me. I think you're looking for @david_mitchell.
@johnandrewhall You're thinking of George III's son. I believe it was named after the future George V.
@Mizza_Mitch Happy birthday! @Tom_M_94
Saw @arobertwebb as @bertiewooster at the Duke of York's yesterday. He was absolutely brilliant, it's a hilarious show. #gruntled
@DaleJay1990 At some point next year, I believe.
@mocfilms I'm extremely chuffed to have remotely had that effect! Glad you're enjoying it and apologies for any embarrassment.
The splendid panel were @RonJichardson, Lloyd Langford, @Kathbum &amp; @GraemeGarden1.
This week I remembered to tweet about the Unbelievable Truth. Sadly I forgot again before I did so. iPlayer link: http://t.co/7PRMogaWN3
@jakeshoolheifer Glad you liked it. And at least it's not a breeze block wall.
@rogerpovey I suspect not.
@SarahMillican75 Very good, thanks. Hope the home straight is fun and enjoy the break.
@TraceeHenge No, that's when a rest is better than a spider.
@SarahMillican75 Thanks - hope you like it. And hope the tour's going well.

@slepkane @officehelpinTO @MrJamesBachman @arobertwebb It's a brilliantly written sketch - but it was a bloody nightmare to learn.
@imyorce I think you mean @david_mitchell, not me. But thanks for the recommendation.
@CrazySadie92 You won't regret it - they're great.
@Breathwick Thanks Katie! It was quite an amazing thing to watch happen.
Panellists are @AlexHorne, @lucybeaumont, @JohnFinnemore and @TheRealJackDee.
Nothing could make me forget to tweet the Unbelievable Truth. However, @VictoriaCoren's triumph in a poker tournament could not. R4 6.30pm.

My wife just won her second EPT Main Event. Nobody's ever been able to say that before. She's amazing. #resistingexclamationmarks #EPTLive

@MattCrivelli @arobertwebb That is us.
Tonight's Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30) panellists are @RonJichardson, Lloyd Langford, @Kathbum &amp; @GraemeGarden1.

@DanseDarjeeling To think I would live to see such wonders!
@Kozmund Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@StuartKavanagh Next year, I think.

No. I always forget. Here's the iPlayer link: http://t.co/UL6FyAMpKs (Guests: @TheRealJackDee, @AlexHorne, @JohnFinnemore &amp; @lucybeaumont.)
Is it because it's the unlucky 13th series of The Unbelievable Truth that I forgot to tweet that episode 1 was on yesterday?
In today's Observer (@ObsNewReview), I argue that honesty is at least a viable policy. But then I would say that. http://t.co/SCuNBd7z9H

@NewHarpsichord I think it was actually David Mitchell, the novelist, who wrote that. But let's hope he got tickets!
@NigelDakin No, actually, but your world view will stand you in good stead in terms of avoiding payday loans, etc.
@Mrspricetom Good work.
@steviekeys1000 Hello! Yes, enjoyed it enormously. Must be great fun to work on. Give my best to Matt.
@jondrytay @BakersTweet Small world! He was terrific.
@MarcJX8P Thanks! Very nice of you to say.
@ChrispyDoDa Thanks - very glad you like it. And yes it was, I think.
Just saw 'I Can't Sing' at the Palladium. It's great: very funny and very surprising. I wasn't expecting a hunchback or an iron lung.
@KateWilliamsUK You're very welcome - was great fun. Very nice to meet you.
@PeterBradshaw1 Thanks! It was a very nice event, I thought.
@HoggRob Yes, I believe it's @Kathbum, @GraemeGarden1, @RonJichardson and Lloyd Langford. Hope you enjoy the recording.
I'm on today's @TheNewsQuiz (R4, 6.30). At the end we did some exercise biking for Sport Relief which was a hell of a lot of fun. #noitwasnt

@dawnmdobson Happy birthday, Lauren!
@prajeshs360 Yes - we're recording one at the moment.
@williamt Thanks very much! Glad you liked it.
@GlennHDKaizer It is, actually.
@dollamanna Sorry you missed it. Better luck next time.
@GlennHDKaizer But it's a novel! (It isn't a novel.)
@LordSuchy Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@SwindonHumanist Difficult to pick a favourite - but I usually say 'Decline and Fall' by Evelyn Waugh.
@CHIMPSINSOCKS Lovely to meet you too! And well done on the show - you were very funny. Glad you enjoyed it.
Of course, that doesn't mean you can eat everything you photograph.
In today's Observer (@ObsNewReview), I stand up for your right to photograph everything you eat. http://t.co/5YJQROtKgJ

@WarwickADavis Hi Warwick. Got your kind direct message but can't reply as you're not following me! Will try again tomorrow.
@alisondixon4 Well I sometimes do.
In the Observer today I say how sad I am that Who Wants to be a Millionaire? is over. Good job I've never seen Bambi. http://t.co/iYF8iLCUml
Today's Unbelievable Truth (6.30, R4), with @henningwehn, @GraemeGarden1, @JeremyJHardy &amp; @VictoriaCoren, is the last in the series.
@cain_rob Thanks!
@pheonixstar_ I'm surprised you're surprised. But then the tide of censorship is rising.
@raycoedllai How rude! Perhaps you think there's no place for levity in newspapers, an opinion with which I couldn't disagree more strongly.
Did you brush your teeth today? Was it boring or chocolatey? These are the issues discussed in my Observer column. http://t.co/wPrWqIaoHz
@LilJerseyDevil Surely they don't have to brush their teeth on Star Trek? It would happen automatically in some sort of cleansing booth.
Forgot to tweet about Unbelievable Truth yesterday! Details: @marcusbrig, @wiggywalsh, @JohnFinnemore, @RufusHound &amp; http://t.co/eWgV58szF2
In today's Observer (@ObsNewReview), I remember the millions whom politicians disown but who'll vote for them anyway. http://t.co/6IM63Df19J
@bearmanormedia Me too.
@frankie_yates No. In fact I've moved out.
@LeydenPete I'd put it more Boris balls than horsemeat. It's funny but it doesn't really matter - it's just one idiot.
@Rach3yP Thanks! And I'm very glad to hear it.
Today's Unbelievable Truth (6.30, R4) stars Lloyd Langford, @tomwriggleswort, @fredmacaulay &amp; @loonabimberton. We have a lovely public chat.
In the Observer (@ObsNewReview) today, I give thanks for horse mince. http://t.co/txP7wTqCWE
@ProfGSheffield That sounds excellent! JL is a brilliant and lovely man.
@SarahMillican75 It certainly is!
@PSNWorldOfHurt I certainly wouldn't watch if I were you - it's a radio show.
@SarahMillican75 Thanks Sarah - happy New Year and congratulations on your marriage!
@danielmaier Thanks! That's very nice to hear.
@ProfGSheffield And particularly with his picking on a much-loved sitcom as if it created the 'lions led by donkeys' idea.
@ProfGSheffield Excellent article, thanks for sending. And hello again! My beef was with Gove's using of the war to bash the BBC &amp; the Left.
The excellent guests were @henningwehn, @GraemeGarden1, @JeremyJHardy and @VictoriaCoren. There were no non-excellent guests.
Here's the iPlayer link to yesterday's Unbelievable Truth which I forgot to tweet about: http://t.co/kyD2CUAEAF
My Observer (@ObsNewReview) column today contains a scene from Blackadder, rewritten to Michael Gove's liking. http://t.co/pP5IY16RRu
Tonight's Unbelievable Truth (Radio 4, 6.30pm) has the following people on it: @marcusbrig, @wiggywalsh, @JohnFinnemore &amp; @RufusHound.
A new series of The Unbelievable Truth starts today at 6.30 on Radio 4. Guests are @ArfurSmith, @henningwehn, @MrEdByrne &amp; @BridgetChristie.
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. So, in my Observer column today, I apply it to the future. http://t.co/dxLaqqz60J @ObsNewReview
@john_field And to you too!
Happy Christmas! #MerryChristmas
The brand new Would I Lie To You? Christmas special is on BBC1 at 8.30 tonight! Guests: @StephenMangan, Miles Jupp, @mermhart &amp; Barry Cryer.
@darrenrichman I've got a mural of that in my bedroom.
From today till 5th Jan, you can buy my memoir Back Story on Kindle for VERY SLIGHTLY less than £2. #unwrappablegifts http://t.co/CiQzACnBBB
@AdeJB As I needed it? I haven't been to the Holly Bush for two years. I think they might have been fibbing.
@daniel_physick We're going to do one more run but not for a year or so.
@revspaced Do it!
@SFrelich10 Of course! But I didn't write "Black Swan Green".
@scottellis87 Oh yes, I'm sure we'll do another at some point.
@JeremyMonkey That is a very old piece of paper!
@shlokes @somethingIsaid Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed the show.
@IggyFields Strictly it's 4. The fifth is "extra content". Which makes it even but also odd as it's usually six.
@TheJonWhitaker Do I? I'm quite pleased.
@scottellis87 Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@ripopgoethezipp Smashing. You're not the first but most of your predecessors meant it seriously which is to your credit.
@The_LeePrice No. I moved out instead.
The last proper episode of this series of That M&amp;W Sound is on R4 at 6.30 today, but there is a BONUS IMPROPER EPISODE at 10pm on R4 Extra.
@ArfurSmith Don't worry at all. As I said, I think it quite suits me.
Really enjoyed 'The Duck House' at the Vaudeville. The script is packed with jokes and @ActualBenMiller's central performance is terrific.
@DrBaalt That's because I shaved my tongue.
@cdaae Yes! #No
@Freesia13 Thanks! So do I.
@timjahr I thought - and I might be wrong - that the radio part of BBC iPlayer was accessible in the US. If so, it'll be on that.
@QueenOfCrime I'm a big fan of "The Body in the Library".
Episode three of the new series of "That Mitchell and Webb Sound" is on Radio 4 at 6.30pm today. It is full of sketches.
Speaking of Radio 4, I'm on tonight's @ISIHAClue at 6.30. Fans of puns will be pleased to hear that there is at least one in the programme.
Here's a sketch @arobertwebb and I did for the Radio 4 Advent Calendar. http://t.co/oOYnOIbXlV
@StevenFeary Thanks - glad you liked them.
@MrsNickleby Oh I think she would. It's "email" that was stretching a point.
@Dave_VileGrin I'm incredulous at your praise and cynical about your motives. But thank you.
@patteeemac Thanks!
@bentandreas They're all I understand.
@29accaciaroad Very glad you liked it. I had Joan Hickson's voice in my head as I wrote it.
@PeterBently Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@katykangaswfc Yes, we're keen to do more - hopefully next year.
@DavidTylerPozz @arobertwebb They're just waiting until "wacky" and "zany" are allowed again.
My Observer (@ObsNewReview) column today is about how Miss Marple might solve the mystery of politics. http://t.co/giWEOT4Wms
@JonBradfield @IanHallard @VictoriaCoren Yes, we had a brilliant time! Congrats on a very entertaining show. And nice to virtually meet you.
Ep 2 of the new series of "That M&amp;W Sound" is on R4 in 64 mins' time. That stat will change, but it will always have been on at 6.30 today.
My Observer column today (in @ObsNewReview) is about fish and fiction. Nicely battered fiction. http://t.co/GXEbDCEUi0
@diveboydave I know I seem very modern, but, in this case, I cling to the old ways.
@tokenginja That m8 b true.
@KemloRose Thanks very much for coming, I certainly enjoyed myself.
@coollike Very nice to meet you. Sorry you were ill. I forget not everyone's an exercise freak like me. A pint would have helped, of course.
By which I mean 11.55pm. What's the point in squeezing stuff into one tweet if I then waste the next tweet clarifying?
The EXTENDED @VicReeves1, @joshwiddicombe &amp; @KirstyWark episode of 'Was It Something I Said?' (last in series) is on C4 at 5 to tomorrow.
I am sorry I didn't give you more warning. On the other hand, I am glad I didn't give you less.
A BRAND NEW series of That Mitchell &amp; Webb Sound, with @arobertwebb, @MrJamesBachman, Olivia Colman and me, starts on R4 in 42 mins' time.
@arobertwebb Brilliant. I assume it involves them climbing onto the roof with a special aerial.
If you're a modern person who can multi-task but can't concentrate, you can play along at home (if you are at home). Follow @somethingIsaid.
The last episode of this series of 'Was It Something I Said?' is on C4 at 10, with guests @VicReeves1, @joshwiddicombe &amp; @KirstyWark.
@bnharrison I've never seen it - but I'm sure you're right.
@SarahMillican75 Thanks, Sarah - very nice of you to say. Glad you liked it.
My Observer column is about recreation in an exciting future when moving around is rendered obsolete by technology. http://t.co/Okc7WBGzHC
@JonnyPCasey There were only three, I'm afraid.
The extended edition of Sunday's "Was It Something I Said?" is on C4 at 11.55pm. 15 minutes more John Craven! That's more than a Newsround!
Apparently if you tweet the hashtag #curious4comedy, you get sent a clip of a Radio 4 comedy show. I eagerly await my cassette in the post.
Tonight's "Was It Something I Said?" (C4, 10) features @rhodgilbertshow, @JosieLong and John Craven, whom I was genuinely thrilled to meet.
My Observer column today is about poppies, sparkly poppies and why it's counterproductive to make people wear them. http://t.co/FONANA1Kmt
@adrianmutton Hello Adrian! Very nice to hear from you. That was a fun show. Hope all's well with you in Delhi!
The extended edition of Was It Something I Said? (the episode with @reginalddhunter, Sally Phillips &amp; John Sergeant) is on C4 at 11.50pm.
Some say there are too many panel shows on TV, others that #WISIS is 15 minutes too short. If you're in the latter group, you're in luck...
@rich_mitch Thanks - glad you liked it. We certainly hope to make more.
@Gbeigel13 We're hoping to make some more next year.
@WormGoddess No I haven't actually. It's not out until tomorrow.
@pibbers Thank you! Very glad you liked it.
@WellWellWellUK Thanks! We'd love to make more, so fingers crossed.
@fetterdave No idea - hope so though.
If horrendous terror on dark, wintry lanes appeals to you, don't let the falling crime rate spoil your fun. http://t.co/FrlIj5vzpC #itsafilm
@Firegal_01 No, I'm afraid it's only three.
Tonight's 'Was It Something I Said?' (@somethingIsaid) features @reginalddhunter, Sally Phillips &amp; John Sergeant and is on C4 at 10.05pm.
@LilJerseyDevil We only shot three, I'm afraid - but may do more next year.
In my Observer column today, I mourn the passing of Ryanair's horrible marketing strategy. http://t.co/KyHUoLh2qy
An extended version of Sunday's "Was It Something I Said?" (the Webb-Jupp-Dance ep) is on C4 at 11.55pm tonight. #solateitsnearlytomorrow
@HarryConstable Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed it.
@ChrisCareyWTPC @olliedimsdale @jwebbdirector It was a fearless examination of issues arising from modern telephony.
@CardinalUpchuck @arobertwebb Christ.
The last ep of this series of Ambassadors is on BBC2 at 9pm tonight. It's packed with gunfire &amp; explosions &amp; people driving vans very fast.
@warp975 Thanks very much!
The same goes for people who say I'm nothing without Miles Jupp or Charles Dance. #WISIS Channel 4, 10pm.
People who say I'm nothing without @arobertwebb can temporarily lift their embargo on "Was It Something I Said?" because he's on it tonight!
In my Observer column today, David Cameron finally gets an explanation of why WHSmith don't sell fruit. http://t.co/5cc3TPTZ3J
@bizparkie Have you read what I wrote? I'm not saying they shouldn't be - just that it's foolish of the government to think they're not.
@JamesMorrisGD Yes, in a bit.
Saw @arobertwebb in 'Raving' at Hampstead Theatre the other night. He's brilliant and it's a very funny show.
@SparkleLamb Only just saw this. Excellent work! Particularly impressed by Ginger's scarf - great attention to detail.
@AdamPhillippy She's gone, sir. And we're back.
The extended repeat of Sunday's "Was It Something I Said?" (the @BrianBlessed, @KathBum &amp; @RealBobMortimer one) is on C4 at 11.55pm tonight.
Thanks very much for all the nice tweets about #Ambassadors last night. If you accidentally missed it, it's here:  http://t.co/9fAdfHzLtp.
@ilikeunic0rns_ Happy birthday!
@JezTaylorGuitar It should still be on iPlayer.
@KatKilshaw There are no sex scenes but there is swearing.
It's episode 2 of #Ambassadors tonight at 9pm on BBC2. Tom Hollander gives a brilliantly funny performance as a visiting prince.
On @somethingIsaid tonight (C4 10.05pm) are the likes of @BrianBlessed, @KathBum and @RealBobMortimer. Very specifically the likes of them.
My Observer column today unapologetically rejoices in the British habit of apologising unnecessarily. http://t.co/6XNJG8PmPp
@HannahFletch I hoped people hadn't spotted that. I'm no good with a glue-on beard. I'd have made a terrible wizard.
@mikaelakristin It was all filmed in Turkey and the Home Counties.
@Kaschington I'm delighted to hear it. Don't forget women.
@marajadesabre Oh good! Thank you.
@garnett21k I'm afraid I haven't even read Cloud Atlas, let alone, as I suspect you think, written it.
The extended edition of Sunday's "Was It Something I Said?", with @mariellaf1, @RomeshRanga &amp; @JasonManford, is on C4 at 11.10 tonight.
@thealexavery That's excellent use of a bus!
@ACWilloughby Turkey and the home counties.
@RozBowden I once had a Samsung something. It looked like a Star Trek communicator but was much less effective.
@c_d_hewson I'm so sorry - the modern world just doesn't give people like you a chance, does it?
@Mr_1470 I wish you better bandwidth. Not in a sex way.
@JeremyTaxman Sorry.
@JanRadovic Thanks! Although I hope I don't die happy for a while.
@catmuir Very glad to hear it - cheers!
@benatom1 Very very very occasionally. But basically I use it to tell people what I'm doing in my job - instead of having a website.
@eph_bee Well that's very nice to hear!
@Photoamor Well, you could sit on and look at a laptop?
@guywalters Yes, sadly the era of being too young for things is gradually giving way to that of being too old for them.
@jriversmn @Swarzlov I'm afraid I don't know. But these things usually make it your way eventually.
@guywalters Thanks very much, Guy. I'm very glad you enjoyed it. Hope all's well with you.
@RaveofRavendale I did see it! I'm very glad you liked the show.
If you undeliberately missed "Ambassadors" last night, you can watch it on the machine you are using now. http://t.co/XR5wv34bTh
@CarryOnSte Thanks - and you're very welcome.
The show @arobertwebb &amp; I are constantly talking about at the moment, "Ambassadors", starts tonight at 9pm on BBC2. #SoNewItHasntGotaHashtag
@richardpbacon Sorry to hear that! Hope someone's there.
Today I'm on @itvthismorning and @richardpbacon's 5Live show to talk about Ambassadors, a new BBC2 comedy-drama which starts tonight at 9pm.
Tonight's 'Was It Something I Said?' (C4, 10.05pm) has guests @mariellaf1, @RomeshRanga &amp; @JasonManford. Play along @somethingIsaid. #WISIS
My Observer column today is about cricket, the Earl of Cardigan and freedom of the press. I also mention dragons. http://t.co/FYFTibJAvf
@chrisdeerin Thanks very much!
@mcneilio I doubt the gov's charter will help media plurality. Hislop explains what it'll do to Private Eye (16.30): http://t.co/GTrpbYOphL
@IHEARTVEGAN It is the best thing about me.
@alanaceb I'm glad someone appreciates it.
The extended edition of this week's 'Was It Something I Said?' - @somethingIsaid - is on C4 tonight at 11.05pm. #WISIS
@cazoz @somethingIsaid Billions find a way.
@monstroso I'm afraid so.
@chithecynic Indeed I was. I should probably be using my life more productively.
@ProblemJohnS @EdithCalman I know what ashtrays are - I just don't know who Ashtrays is.
@monstroso Perhaps we need to be more like Jordan or David Cameron.
@monstroso I think it would be a lot easier to get publicity if what we did for a living was have arguments rather than write or make TV.
@DJZackRocket Thanks! Very glad you like it!
@Nickedgington That's certainly possible.
@Imethimonce Yes, it is odd, isn't it.
@ProblemJohnS Who is Ashtrays?
Slightly but not massively interested in astronomy? Then you'll like these OU animations I did some reading out for. http://t.co/OfQqpFdPK2
@monstroso Thanks, Charlie, glad you liked it - was nice to establish the actual sequence of events. But sorry I didn't mention Crackanory!
'Was It Something I Said?' starts in 1 minute on Channel 4. If you want to join in without feeling mad, follow @somethingIsaid. #WISIS
Today's 'Was It Something I Said?' (C4, 10pm) has guests @MrEdByrne, @Gabby_Logan &amp; Phil Daniels w/ regulars Richard Ayoade &amp; Micky Flanagan
My Observer column today is about polar bears and a row I didn't have with @monstroso. http://t.co/BrjDrLhOl6
@JNRaeside Thanks, Julia! Glad you liked it.
The extended version of Sunday's "Was It Something I Said?" is on C4 at 10.50pm tonight. You can play along by following @somethingisaid.
@lizbrownsell Never. And now I've moved out.
@mattowlgale Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed it.
@vanderwing Yes, there's actually an extended version on tonight. I'm just about to tweet the details.
@eddy_apogee Thanks very much - very nice of you to say.
@mrjohnofarrell Very nice to bump into you. Hope the beer helped with the football.
@rllyquitetired I'm afraid I occasionally have.
@cmachapman57 @somethingIsaid Thanks! There's actually an extended version which they're showing next Friday.
Best of both worlds: Was It Something I Said? is like a cross between Sgt Brody and Mrs Patmore. Starts in 3 minutes on C4. @somethingIsaid
@cateches I'm afraid I don't know. Wait until it gets repeated there or goes up online. Are you in St Helena or the Falklands?
@redflag1959 Of course!
@neilfinch63 They're @jimmycarr, @monstroso and @DavidHarewood.
@ChrisPalmer147 I actively encourage it.
@JasonManford No, not tonight's - not sure of TX order. You were hilarious on the show.
@sallyjwatson @thomasbeckett Oh yes, it was designed for people like Tom.
@LyonJE That is what they're officially called.
@nellerobs Yes, the remote control has meant the death of viewer loyalty.
(You don't actually have to play along if you don't want to. You can just sit there watching it, like in the old days.) 10.05pm, Channel 4.
Watching TV used to be simple. Not any more. Here's your instruction manual for tonight's "Was It Something I Said?" http://t.co/8crpVCgdf3
Also, its Twitter account - @somethingIsaid - is doing a quiz at 2pm. I will now temporarily stop going on about it.
It's called 'Was It Something I Said?', with team captains Richard Ayoade &amp; Micky Flanagan &amp; guests @jimmycarr, @monstroso &amp; @DavidHarewood.
No Observer column from me today, due to pressure of not having written one. But I am hosting a new show at 10.05pm on Channel 4 tonight.
@Herne_TheHunter @somethingIsaid No.
But before that, I'm hosting tonight's Have I Got News For You (BBC1, 9pm) with guest panellists @prodnose and @cathynewman.
Do #ff @somethingisaid, the new C4 comedy quotations quiz which starts on Sunday. I'm on Alan Carr: Chatty Man at 10 tonight to discuss it.
Morning, everyone. Going on @itvthismorning today to talk about @somethingisaid, a new C4 panel show which starts on Sunday.
Some of us are trying to address tougher issues, like James Bond's vinaigrette.
I see my wife's column is most read on Comment is Free. All very easy when you choose crowd-pleasing subjects like the importance of nuance.
@icklenellierose It's good work you do.
@AlfieJervis69 Interesting. The "David M' is, I think, scanned from something I wrote. But someone else has definitely added the "itchell".
My Observer column today is about oil. And an international superspy. And vinegar. http://t.co/ys15s7DjLZ
@dodd2311 Thanks very much. Glad it bears rewatching. I think series 4 might be my favourite.
@kerpow42 Happy birthday!
@Northtolstoy You're very kind! And you look extremely like me in your photo.
@brucedes Thanks very much for your nuanced voice of reason! You summarised the situation perfectly.
@monstroso Thanks, Charlie. Read your comment and I completely agree. I doubt anyone will write an article about that though.
@5ledger @monstroso Actually, the misleading article I was talking about was in The Independent.
@monstroso ..more sketch shows! I'm sorry that that rather misleading article made it look like I was arguing with you.
@monstroso ..a "response" to that at all - in fact my actual response was in The Times saying I agree with you! Of course there should be..
@monstroso Hi Charlie. Just seen this article - they took quotes from an interview I did well before your Radio Times interview! It wasn't..
Speaking of John Lloyd, I've just realised I'm on tonight's episode of QI (BBC2, 10pm). It is a new one.
John Lloyd (created QI, produced Blackadder) did a hilarious show in Edinburgh &amp; now it's on in London: 7.30, 5th Oct, Bloomsbury Theatre.
@HonneeFam No, I wasn't fat in the '80s, I was a thin child.
@_Elvis_Jr Happy birthday, Elvis!
@Enigmanaut They've done another.
Speaking of ageing, I'm on tonight's "Big Fat Quiz of the '80s" (C4, 9pm) as a tribute to the fact that I was alive for all of the '80s.
My Observer column today is about ageing and how to fight it: act like you're already old. http://t.co/h8uMbRX4XW
@jessicakryan Thanks, glad to hear it.
@Clairetoni Well I'm very glad you're enjoying it - thanks!
People are pointing out that Peep Show was ten years old yesterday. That makes me feel quite old. Also, God help us when it starts puberty.
@TacticalRonin Thanks, and happy birthday!
Here's another, and the last, little clip of me talking about some photos from my book: http://t.co/2PaaVd1486
@GazWeetman You think the Pharaohs disobeyed that key rule, no socks with sandals?
@SuexWard That's very nice of you to say, thank you.
@HereComezBod Happy birthday!
@13daysaweek Hope the day went well, and you were covered in confetti not piss.
@channinghailey I wish my wife could say the same thing.
@PhilipArdagh Very glad you like it; I certainly enjoyed reading it out.
@Deansbomb Yes.
@hungoverdrawn Sorry about that. But keep your eye on the positive long term benefit: free Cornish pasties.
@KirbySummerell Wonky table?
My Observer column today is about whether Newsnight and politicians are boring. #NoButYouAre #GotThereBeforeYou http://t.co/C2AcwHSs5c
I've written an Observer column for the first time in ages. It details my failure to understand something unimportant http://t.co/HvalIk9ynZ
Unless you're in Scotland, in which case the WILTY ep starts an hour later. This is despite there not being a time difference.
Tonight I'm in a brand new ep of QI at 10pm on BBC2 and then, 5 minutes after it finishes, a brand new compilation ep of WILTY on BBC1.
Some of you will have hoped and prayed for this day: it's the last of my little book mentioning videos. http://t.co/A9qUcl5wcG
@foodhypnotist Thanks very much! I do hope the aliens like it too.
If you liked hearing me ramble on about some photos last week, here's your chance to do it some more. http://t.co/Xzsv5JGiPa
@Draczar ABSOLUTELY not.
In this week's book walk talk video thing, I'm standing outside a nice pub. http://t.co/mLb2plj68U
@WhatICallBecky It's now called 'Ambassadors'. I don't know a broadcast date yet.
@fagforwords Happy birthday!
@mikaelakristin Thanks! Hope you enjoy it.
Good point! RT @Andrew_Taylor: @RealDMitchell That sounds pretty handy for those of us as bought the audiobook.
@jd240978 Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
If you're assembling my book from internet fragments, then here's me talking about some of the photos in it. http://t.co/T9OYJ4kM7p
@ShydayC Yes.
This week's book walk instalment contains a HEARTFELT OPINION. Please do not say if you disagree with it. http://t.co/ibxYZZ3lFv
@RobinFrench2 Thanks very much!
@kyleworgan You're welcome. Glad you enjoyed the show.
@SarahMillican75 Lovely to see you too - it was a brilliant show.
@CSRaphael1 Don't I look grumpy! Sorry about that.
In this week's book walk instalment, I'm hanging around Regent's Park loos. http://t.co/8U6DdkhKQ3
No Observer column from me today, or for the next few weeks. But don't worry - it would only have been as unamusing as this tweet.
@joemcclarence Thanks! Baths may yet save publishing.
@MarcFestival I think I'd been walking every day for about three months when I realised I was feeling significantly better. Best of luck.
@HobartBookshop Thanks very much for the recommendation. I'm glad you liked it.
@Andrea_Duranfan Currently, no.  I hope that situation changes at some point.
@agatafrymus Thanks very much! Very glad you liked it.
Some weeks ago I emptied the contents of my head out of my mouth in front of a camera. Here's another bit. http://t.co/AtEjqI0cE3
@funnyhillclose I'll never understand fashion.
@kowbs Some people even stay awake, I'm told.
@LilJerseyDevil Precisely.
@CaraCompass So do I.
@JtotheTea87 Thanks! Some time in the autumn, I think.
@Grendel50 I very much agree.
@BarnsleyGreen Happy birthday to him or her. Her seems slightly more likely from the cake - but then boys like princesses too.
@CharleeDrew I think I'd marginally prefer to start my day with a workout than a rave.
Here's this week's book walk instalment in which I am standing outside the Marriott Regent's Park. http://t.co/Iw2ZKv3LY5
@Lmdane It's not losing high quality pens that I fear, but not having a cheap pen to hand.
@laurenlaverne Definitely. We might spot a new Ripper. OR BECOME ONE OURSELVES.
My Observer column this week is about the difference between Lady Gaga and people who work for a building society. http://t.co/8eblN8a2NV
A former, recorded me is still wandering around London banging on about his book to a camcorder. This one has a view. http://t.co/Jr3jbmzcpX
I didn't write a column for the Observer this week, but I will next week.
@VegetaAtSakcon I don't know, I'm afraid. I think so. It's certainly available online in North America.
If you missed my Apple Store Q&amp;A (and the overwhelming statistical likelihood is that you did), it was recorded: http://t.co/A1xw6YstBa.
@phc_library Thanks! Will do.
@beeraelarue It's feeding some chickens when I was 2.
@4AidansBirthday Happy 21st Aidan!
@MendzappJames Thanks - very glad you liked it.
@simonblackwell Thanks, Simon! I enjoy banging on about why Peter Sellers is good - very glad you approve.
Regular as a clock that can be up to an hour out, here's this week's book discussion snippet from Primrose Hill. http://t.co/xw9bMYUxHb
@dabbidoo Happy birthday to you too (for yesterday).
@MetalMummy2010 Yes indeed. It was my (not 24th) yesterday. Happy birthday!
Thanks very much to all the people who wished me a happy birthday on here yesterday. Very kind and much appreciated.
My Observer column today is in favour of all sorts of shady goings-on. http://t.co/yx6GLdfu34
Here's this week's instalment of my book walk, stop walking, stand and talk. http://t.co/H1mhebmcbR
@gerrard1212 What does she win? An incredibly low standard politeness competition?
@MartinStanton67 Fair point.
My Observer column today argues that, when 2 people are tangoing, it's daft to debate which of them is tangoing most. http://t.co/PnFopkXfs9
@Jettco You're welcome! Glad you enjoyed it.
@Vertandor Very nice of you to say. Glad you liked it.
@LilJerseyDevil I'm sorry if it spoils your dinner.
@MatthewMclane Thanks! Very glad to hear it - but also sorry if that was annoying.
@Speirs2W It certainly is.
@XanderArmstrong What an extremely nice thing to say! Thank you so much, Xander. I'm very glad you enjoyed it.
Here's this week's instalment of my book-video-walk media-merge scheme. Hope you enjoy all 198 seconds of it. http://t.co/2avnNrXjdc
@hodgman I wish you were too. I have so many answers. Glib, superficial answers - but lots of them.
@mmonogram That's a shame - sorry to miss you so relatively narrowly. Hope all's well with you.
If you're in the Apple Store Regent St on Thurs at 7 &amp; have a query about my book, you're in luck! Free tickets here: http://t.co/OiHIR8upxU
@JoshDaveJones Looking back, I regret that I didn't put "at home" in capitals as well.
@paulo232323 In July some time, I think.
@mtappenden More like Wordwang.
@geordie89liam Yes, 'Let Me Guess' is a great panel show.
@ConsultantHead I'm sorry to tell you that that was written by the novelist David Mitchell and not by me. I don't think he's on Twitter.
@vijaykhurana Yes.
@Healey17 Today I didn't have any breakfast. I'm contemplating some mid-morning toast.
You can follow the show on Twitter - @somethingIsaid - and then when it's on TV, you'll be able to PLAY ALONG WITH THE GAME at home.
No Observer column from me this week because I've been filming a new show for Channel 4 called 'Was It Something I Said?'.
I forgot to tweet the last ep in the series of "Would I Lie To You?" yesterday. I'm a fool. Here it is on iPlayer: http://t.co/Nr2ehj6WPW
@HelgaVonClapp Pretty good, thanks.
@prevans91 Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
... at the Apple Store, Regent Street. Here are some details: http://t.co/WN36Nrmc7o.
If you've developed a taste for me talking about my own book, you can watch me do it live and indeed ask me questions, next Thursday, 7pm...
Here's the latest instalment of my book walk/talk/camcorder voyage: http://t.co/VXYrp447eS.
My Observer column today puzzles over the lavish lifestyles of the people with the least amount of money on Earth. http://t.co/5OnTMzZNw2
On tonight's 'Would I Lie To You?' (BBC1, 8.30) are Kirsty Young, @henningwehn, Joanna Scanlan &amp; @GregJRutherford. In my view, it is funny.
@edward8000 Apologies, that should have read 'get in' not 'get it'.
@otherotherdan Yes.
@Lord_Bob True.
@edward8000 Then most of them won't get it.
@Evan_MG I'm really sorry - I only just saw your message. Terribly sorry you missed the show.
@robindean92 Oh yes - we've got a new show about diplomats coming out later in the year.
@BadsideBirtt That's tricky. I started writing silly fantasy playscript stories when I was 9 or 10. But nothing with jokes till I was 15.
@Jillisant Very kind of you, thanks. And I'm very glad you liked it.
@OllieOctopi Thanks! And I think it'll be on in July or August.
@krisjones1 I must say, I'm not sure I've ever seen a Victorian FRP - but, yes, it's definitely the post-war ones I mean.
@SizzlerKistler Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
Here's this week's book chat snippet. Hope you like it. http://t.co/tdTWkCZ02G
If you're in north London at noon on Saturday then do come to this: http://t.co/8OuR3kZx4p. It's at St Peter's Belsize Park and it's free.
My Observer column today says it's daft to slag off sitcom characters for being bad role models. http://t.co/gkrIfeCAFs
'Would I Lie To You?' is back on today (BBC1, 8.30pm) with @RealBobMortimer, @SarahMillican75, @RonJichardson and @DavidHarewood.
@geppsdood I haven't had one for about 25 years but I enjoyed them then.
@soophiemoore I think that quite suits me.
Tonight's 10 O'Clock Live is on at 10.30! It'll still be live on C4 though. I'll be joined by @rupinderbainsuk, @richardpbacon &amp; @Baddiel.
Here's the next little snippet of my ongoing book-mentioning walk. Hope you like it. http://t.co/lNXFTpDR5Z
@qi_obsessive Thanks! Very glad you enjoyed them both.
My Observer column this week is about how to deal with hecklers. http://t.co/iE3ELHonUh
@SarahGrahamCCB I'm afraid I have no influence on the other two, but happy birthday from me.
@AlistairCorbett Happy birthday!
@mrianleslie Thanks Ian - glad you liked it.
If you'd like to watch a recording - at Maidstone Studios - the tickets are free and you can apply for them here: http://t.co/QIfSRP5N9D.
I'm recording a new show for Channel 4 over the next month, called 'Was it Something I Said'. Richard Ayoade &amp; Micky Flanagan are in it too.
@KieranMurray93 Not a nightmare, no - but it can be tricky.
@White_CollarBoy Really? One Labour MP and one Conservative MP? I thought that was pretty reasonable.
Tonight on C4: RT @10oClockLive East meets west (er... London), as @HackneyAbbott &amp; @ZacGoldsmith join @RealDMitchell for some hearty debate
@indiechick123 No.
@sofckingchuffed I'm relieved to see you live in Australia. But then I don't suppose many places in the UK are stocking it either.
@gilescoren You've spotted my scheme to find excuses to mention it.
Here's the second in the series of videos I've made about my book, Back Story. Hope you like it. http://t.co/pK037zlbQW
In my Observer column today, I marvel at what lucky people Network Rail's bosses are. http://t.co/XzntXzMCJu
Then, in case you're not sick of me, I'm also on Graham Norton at 10.35, chatting away with Andrew Flintoff and Jennifer Lopez as usual.
Tonight's Would I Lie To You guests are @SusanCalman, @richardosman, @carolkirkwood &amp; @phlaimeaux. It's on BBC1 at 8.30pm.
@SpaceToffee It's only by watching that that I know what to say.
@Dotgranville Thanks! Very glad you both liked it.
But if you'd like to watch the show IN THE FLESH, you can apply for tickets here: http://t.co/WIdzmM79fH.
10 O'Clock Live is on tonight. If you'd like to watch the show LIVE then just turn on Channel 4.
Here's the first of my series of clips talking about my memoir, Back Story: http://t.co/bzjsMM33TY. There'll be one a week for a short aeon.
My Observer column today is about robots and police, but vehicle excise duty also gets a mention. http://t.co/KS86UIF3zd
@QuinnPiper Oh good! Thanks.
@Neostarr It was actually released yesterday so I hope it'll be in shops soon. If he tries again and it's not, tell him to ask at the desk.
@Prontomike Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
@edronmonds No, although that should be happening at some point too.
@matthud59 Bang on.
@missbding Well now I'm a book whore too! #diversification
I'll be putting a short video up every week in a way that I hope is tantalising and fear is annoying.
I've shot some short videos talking about "Back Story" &amp; going to some of the places mentioned. Here's an intro: http://t.co/bqcOV8LtNi
On Would I Lie To You? tonight (BBC1 8.30): @joshwiddicombe, @radioleary, @matt9dawson &amp; Mel Giedroyc. Quite an emotional one, as I recall.
Also, I am on Heresy tonight, as my wife has just tweeted from the next room. Thank God for the internet. It's on Radio 4 at 6.30pm.
Or hate it enough to buy the book and then burn it. #imnotprecious http://t.co/3Xfs8HR7mF
Here's a clip of me talking about "Back Story". Hope you enjoy it enough to buy the book. http://t.co/3Xfs8HR7mF
@ceno_byte Yes, it's very much a companion guide.
An alternative source: RT @AnnaWatson99 strongly recommend http://t.co/tHNM648Ci3. You buy online but they support your local indie bookshop
I've made some short videos talking about the book and what's in it and why I think that's good, the first of which will go up later today.
My book "Back Story" is out in paperback! You can buy it cheaply here http://t.co/4lRbicV8nu or less cheaply from firms that pay more tax.
I must be especially excited about 10 O'Clock Live today because I've remembered to tweet it. Now all I have to do is remember to be on it.
@klee_mfc Blimey! That should expand her vocabulary.
@WayneBeeSmith Very glad to hear it. #radio4isthefuture
@bakebakebaker Hope you don't mind me droning on about myself.
@Tom @tomcoates I'd argue that usage has taken decimate away from the literal Roman sense of killing one in ten. My dictionary agrees.
@divie316 Using science.
@j9obrien Not at all! Thanks for listening.
@thealexavery Hope you like it! There are a couple of good snaps of Collie.
@FeralPleasures I'm very glad to hear it! I noticed your tweets last night and thought you must have got the wrong end of the stick.
@MargoJMilne Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
@DSchmerek I'm hoping to make some more, later in the year.
@Unnamedinsider If so, I wasn't in on it either.
@eedun You seem to be reading it somewhere very picturesque. Hope you and the bug both enjoy it.
@Edmundith No, I lived in Headington, but got the bus to Abingdon every day. Never seen it from the air though.
My Observer column today is about the elegance of nasty things done well. http://t.co/WijVcrdrJR
On "Would I Lie To You?" tonight (BBC1, 8.30pm) are @WarwickADavis, @Hollywoodbaker, @JDBakewell and Jason Manford.
The LAST Unbelievable Truth of the series is on R4 26 mins from now! Guests: @watsoncomedian, @thefridgeman, @loonabimberton &amp; @MrEdByrne.
@dereknorman552 Just about to!
In the Observer today is the most scintillating column about planning laws that I've ever written. Also the first. http://t.co/Ky9YpmmRMB
Ever seen @StephenMangan, @Isysuttie, @therealgokwan &amp; Charles Dance play a parlour game? If not, try Would I Lie To You today, 8.30, BBC1.
Do watch 10 O'Clock Live tonight on Channel 4. If you'd like to, that is.
@ukpuppetboy @mawtweets I very much doubt that Wayne was the deviser of the pun anyway.
@joequinn08 Well, by nature I'm a historian not a futurologist.
@izmuj Thanks!
Don't forget the Unbelievable Truth's on at 6.30 on R4. I never do. Panel: @richardosman, @JohnFinnemore, @lucybeaumont, @rhodgilbertshow.
@ukpuppetboy Even better than that - it was called 'Norfolk Enchants'. Such an elegant name in paper.
@soochef That would have been a great angle to give his lawyer.
@Trollololno You're right, other insults hurt more. I just thought those ones were an interesting illustration of how irrational racism is.
@clarkgwent Thanks for copying me in on that. Thoughtful. Do you have many friends?
@TrevorMLambert I'm not sure, no - although it did say it on a piece of paper someone handed me.
In my Observer column today, I argue that calling someone a sheep-shagger isn't particularly insulting. http://t.co/bgHHrthBbJ
@zaracno I'd love to one day - but I've never been asked.
@DWrycbar124 No they're not.
@NigelsTasties At last the Botox is showing!
@qi_obsessive Very old. We got some new ones taken the other day. I expect they won't start using those until I've shaved.
New series of "Would I Lie To You" starts tonight, 8.30, BBC1. Panellists @rhodgilbertshow, @daraobriain, @OfficialVernonK, @denise_vanouten
@Calla30 No.
@sallyjwatson Don't you mean shouty?
I really am not getting the hang of the internet. I thought I was for a while. But it turns out I wasn't.
It was on last night. I was doing it live. But I didn't tweet it. I was going to tweet that it's now on 4OD but I can only find last week's.
I know I'm more fascinated than most by my inability to remember to tweet things but I can't help it. Anyway, the latest is @10oClockLive.
@sillyboots Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
@olliedimsdale Thanks! Very glad you liked it, Ollie. I hope I didn't allow the debate to become TOO chaotic!
AT LAST I HAVE REMEMBERED TO TWEET ABOUT THE UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH! This is me remembering. It's on Radio 4 today at 6.30pm.
I'm back in the Observer after a few weeks away, which I now realise I should have spent abseiling in the New Forest. http://t.co/TJP6NxVDZC
@PhilipUpstone What an excellent use of time! I think pupils should be encouraged to buzz in if they spot something true during all lessons.
@Goodbye_Blues Happy birthday! But I'm afraid my advice isn't worth having and I wouldn't want to encourage the eating of clothes.
Anyway, last night's featured @MrEdByrne, @watsoncomedian, @loonabimberton and @thefridgeman.
I'm bitterly aware that I've failed to tweet ANY of this series' eps of Unbelievable Truth in time. I'm a sorry fool. http://t.co/PD2KqWsWTr
Forgot to tweet re yesterday's Unbelievable Truth w/ @richardosman, @lucybeaumont, @JohnFinnemore &amp; Rhod Gilbert. http://t.co/4j6KDwDjbe
And this evening, I'm off to record the last episode at the Shaw Theatre with @thefridgeman, @MrEdByrne, @loonabimberton &amp; @watsoncomedian.
Managed to miss the 1st ep of a new series of Unbelievable Truth yesterday. If you did too, here's the iPlayer link: http://t.co/Vs0J9lZma3
@ShivaniGhai Thanks, Shivani. It was great working with you. All the best.
@emmarowson Thanks - very glad you liked it.
@CarrDarch Bravo!
@qi_obsessive That's what you get for forgetting to bribe the artist.
@qi_obsessive @lovefromlucy_ Oh yes.
@Jordaneer_Becky Well spotted! Just doing that in a minute.
@ilikeunic0rns_ Yes, we start shooting one in a couple of weeks' time.
@GFTBen No.
@olliedimsdale Sorry - only just saw this. Have done so.
@AndyKeels1 I hope you like my new hoodie and facial tattoo.
@ExRNBosun @Simbosonic Yes I am!
@richardmorrisuk It's coming back - later this month.
@dysonhamer People so often do.
@olliedimsdale It was great fun working with you. Hope we get to do some more. Best of luck with the marathon.
Sorry I haven't been tweeting much. I never do that much even when I'm not filming in Turkey. And currently I AM filming in Turkey.
@jjc505 Thanks Jim! You can send it to my agent, Milburn Browing Associates (the address is very googlable).
@BethanyPackwood Hope you like the last quarter.
@TigyandPix PS Thanks re the book. Glad you liked it.
@VaunEarlNorman My God, I was hot once.
@TigyandPix With difficulty and not on a public road. For a lot of the time, it's being pushed by the crew and I'm just steering.
@ShafJetha These days, I get asked that all the time.
In "Goodbye Television Centre" tonight at 8.30 on BBC4, I sit next to some AMAZING people to say how sad it is that TV Centre is closing.
@GeoffRMann Please don't let me keep you.
I'm on Only Connect for Comic Relief tonight at 8.30 on BBC Four. Tune in to watch me get things wrong in front of my wife.
@kelly1281_ It's actually the Observer I write for (goes on the Guardian website) but I'm still doing it. Just taking a few weeks off.
@mjbrassill Later this year is all I know.
@RealDavidMorton Yes, I think so. Probably in April.
@meegan_eliza It's what they call a 'comedy-drama'.
@melbournedaz Don't know, but I hope so.
@samuelpeepses That'll teach me to adopt new acronyms at my age.
@SamanthaEllis27 Hi Sam! Didn't realise you'd been there. Would have been good research for me! Hope all's well with you.
Am doing this ATM: RT @bbcpress: Filming begins on new @RealDMitchell &amp; @arobertwebb comedy series 'Our Men' for BBC2 http://t.co/q3jzuKBx11
@Nikki_Bel How weird! I have no memory of ever standing in that room.
@jonathancant Thanks! Very nice of you to say.
@rogerstevoooo I think so - but not for a while.
@emidixon No (see biog).
@TheMitchellMob I have indeed.
@ThunderBadger Thanks - that's very nice of you to say. Glad you liked it.
@mutatedLlama Sorry, been busy filming. Won't be tweeting much till early April.
@CraigImperialis Antony Beevor.
@LouiseCunning I'm very glad to hear it - thanks.
@karenglynn8 What business is it of theirs where he's buried? They didn't dig him up.
@mrsmosieposie Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@lauraharrad Sorry.
@afcDuncan Thanks! I'm going to try and be less picky about food genres though.
@rdstephen Well, hope you enjoy it. I had a brilliant time there (as you know).
@robinince On the contrary, I'm sure they're glad of the change. Very much enjoyed your piece by the way. #soundslikeasexthingbutisnt
@rdstephen Thanks! And glad you thought I did the area a bit of justice.
@JESSICABUNTY I'm glad to hear it. But I'm afraid it's the only diagram in the book.
No Observer column from me today. I'm taking a few weeks off to film something. Luckily she hasn't noticed me yet.
@joshingrey You must think I'm ageing fast.
@Canutesford Perfect! It's not a fruit, it's some fruits.
I'm very sad that Richard Briers has died. He was a brilliant comic actor. Whenever I've acted, I've always hoped to be something like him.
@AaronFG_727 Thanks very much. And hello!
@Leah_Likes That is NOT what I'm saying!
@UnmannedDave Too soon.
@swig_more_jam_e You seem fun.
@sharonpavey "Twilight actor Robert Pattinson".
@stephen_coxy Not at Madame Tussauds but I've made one at home.
@p3nno Johnson, maybe. He'd certainly think he knows.
@plumjam61 That's what I keep telling her.
@LizJarvisUK Probably - but less so, I'd have thought.
@p3nno No he wouldn't.
@Nicmeister71 Yes.
@JowiaSzwedo I'm afraid that was written by another David Mitchell, but you're not the first person who's told me it's very good.
@CelebrityPony If it had really been me, I'm sure he would have come first.
@karlbell Do you think I could put '"Similar to God" Twitter' on the front of a future DVD?
@nostawnai A Buddhist.
@debs_rodgers Thanks! And a very happy birthday to you. Have a lovely day.
@LilJerseyDevil I don't think I'd mind. What would depress me is when it was subsequently melted down to be made into a younger comedian.
In my Observer column this week, I completely explain what women find attractive. http://t.co/8aNUXcSz
@futuresail0rs Thank you. I'm extremely pleased to hear it.
@NeilSargent86 Thanks! Glad you liked it.
@GeorgeGibsonn Thanks! I'd forgotten I owned that shirt.
@CelebrityPony Sadly not - I've never played online bridge, although I'd be lying if I said I couldn't see the appeal.
1st recording of new run of Unbelievable Truth TONIGHT at the Shaw Theatre. Guests: Lloyd Langford, @henningwehn, @Kathbum &amp; @GraemeGarden1.
In the Observer today, I propose a metaphorical Savlon to soothe the planet's wounds. http://t.co/ezgbtoTk
@James_Pirie Either that or it's just tired.
@keiththecamel @markstuffed That makes a cheeseburger doubly compliant.
@TheMightyGusset Nicely put.
@Baddiel @simonblackwell They'd probably advocate an apology. The BBC have been very slow to respond to this.
@ChrisYearsley Yes, they were told to avoid the phrase: "beef lasagnes that are actually made of beef rather than horse".
@simonblackwell Frankly, the prospect of a lasagne that didn't fully comply is terrifying. Would it try and eat me back?
Is their definition of horse "non-" or "partially compliant beef"? I think horses are MORE compliant than cattle. They let you ride them.
I was intrigued to read this quote from a Findus UK spokesman: "Fully compliant beef lasagne will be in stores again soon."
@Lucyfoulds13_ How come Bieber finds the combined effect of a fire and a fondue burner so chilling?
@kraln Apologies, I should have said "people who manage software engineers".
@LhugTur I am very sorry to hear that! I wish there was something I can do. As it is, I barely know what Netflix is.
@Tobyisnotmyname Very glad you liked it! Hope the muscle heals.
@BreakingStrong I think you might be that entire demographic. Very nice to hear from you!
To me, that sounds tricky. RT @MitchBenn Gonna try to write &amp; record an album in 24hrs for Comic Relief http://t.co/0wSDW04a …
@Mirthematician I swear I try and live for at least an hour every day.
@ClassicsScholar Thanks Alex! Very glad to hear it, on both counts.
This series's last episode of Unbelievable Truth (featuring @JohnFinnemore, @henningwehn, @wiggywalsh &amp; @ArfurSmith) is on R4 at 6.30 today.
My Observer column today is complaining about private school head teachers' complaining. http://t.co/1MPQ9nPH
@xdkerr I might have a bash one day.
@qi_obsessive I don't think that's weird at all - but you might be asking the wrong person.
@daily_slap You'd now have a picture of me smiling embarrassedly.
@ScottPryceJones Thanks - and we'll bear you in mind!
@xdkerr I see. I'm sorry it wasn't me.
@trousersablaze That's very nice of you to say - thank you. Glad you liked it.
@LynseyDalladay Oh, lots of them - although I haven't read one for a while.
@clarkerz I'm very glad you liked it - thanks for reading.
@xdkerr I think you mean the other David Mitchell.
@OldBearsCrow That's very nice of you to say. I'm extremely glad you liked it.
@yell0w_pagess What an excellent customer you are! Hope you enjoy them.
@CeiraThomas They do - they're so comforting. I could do with a nice warm sheet of A4 right now.
@LilJerseyDevil I don't think so - maybe in another series's time.
@palmerw73 No one has ever asked me that question before. The answer, I'm pretty sure, is no.
@thealexavery Lovely to see you too. Sorry to have to race off.
@jasonking1973 Tricky! But whatever you do, don't decide on the basis of what someone on the internet you've never met says.
@Beth_D11 That is an excellent title if wearisome prospect.
Apologies! It's @CeliaPacquola not @cpack who's in the Unbelievable Truth  today. Sorry to both for the mix-up.
@CeliaPacquola @cryptomonkton Whoops, sorry - my mistake. Will amend.
@DomSequitur I'm pleased to hear it, on both counts.
@Beth_D11 thanks! Glad you liked it. And I'm afraid I'm not letting on.
@CrispinSmith Yes, sorry about that - but got to give the PE a rest at some point, I thought.
There is another episode of Unbelievable Truth at 6.30 on Radio 4 today. It has Phill Jupitus, Lloyd Langford, @cpack and @marcusbrig in it.
@DanMachin87 That's very nice of you. There may be a book one day but no firm plans at the moment.
My Observer column today is about all the problems, challenges and opportunities created by different sorts of water. http://t.co/QNE7ommr
@journojames Very nice of you to say.
@GreatSolis It was true then.
@jamespoulter May it bring you vertebral strength.
@geekzillauk Thanks! Very glad you liked it.
@LBCherrett Christ, I didn't know my face did that.
Today's Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30) stars @monstroso, @loonabimberton, @MrEdByrne &amp; @thefridgeman. It's NEVER BEEN HEARD BEFORE.
You can also do that if you hate it, which I genuinely think would be a really powerful ironic statement and would totally show us.
If you like 'Would I Lie To You?' you can vote for it to be named Best Panel Show at the National TV Awards. Please do! http://t.co/rbgYwAGw
@xjarmeen How about 'Happy birthday, Julie!'? That seems appropriate.
Forgot to tweet yesterday's Unbelievable Truth but it's on iPlayer: http://t.co/isnDht9x (There are more jokes in it than in this tweet).
@wesjdj Yes, I find them very useful.
No Observer column from me today - I'm back the week after next. #noobservercolumnfrommetodayimbacktheweekafternext
Tonight's Unbelievable Truth (R4, 6.30pm) with @henningwehn, Rhod Gilbert, Celia Pacquola &amp; Lloyd Langford, was recorded at the Edin Fringe.
@JamezMarsden Thanks! I'm very glad you liked it - and I can only apologise about my voice.
@saramccolligan Thank you! And I'm very glad the waiting worked out for you both.
@gondii1 Thank you! Very nice of you to say.
@BookofTrains It would be a great honour.
My Observer column today is about why people will pay top dollar to smell each other close up. http://t.co/Gba4Vsmn
@Sam_Huddy Ridiculously, I STILL haven't been there. Nice to hear that it's nice though.
@ghunter1978 Thanks - that's very nice of you to say.
@AnnMWilkins Thanks - glad you like it. I'm afraid I'm still waiting for someone to cast me as a king.
@EternalLife_ So does the voice in mine.
@CSAmbrose I'm so sorry/I'm so glad - please delete depending on the nature of the sobbing.
@bobafee I am SO sorry!
@CrispHull I know what you mean - it makes books seem like a test of endurance. But thanks for reading it.
@Sneakglove Thanks - I'm glad to hear it improved the mood of the van.
@dellyinrowley Thanks! And I'm very glad you're enjoying the book.
@jonbjc Was that "Innocent Millions Dead or Dying"? I hope it made you jealous in an entertained way.
@Tomos_Rees Can I put that quote on the cover of the paperback?
@rarspberry You're not - hello!
Panellists include @monstroso, @thefridgeman, @loonabimberton and @MrEdByrne, and exclude everyone else.
Happy New Year everyone except the evil! A new series of Unbelievable Truth started yesterday on R4 &amp; I forgot to say. http://t.co/VrHcuDLE
My Observer column today looks back on the year to come. I tried the same thing 12 months ago and got everything wrong. http://t.co/P7kOMaX8
Happy Christmas! To get in the festive mood tonight's Peep Show was filmed in the summer &amp; features a picnic. (10pm, C4, last of the series)
@mclyne85 It was an actual flat for the first two series but since then we've filmed the flat scenes on a set.
@rrt23 Really? She was played by the same actress who played that part in previous series.
@AlexCozens93 Sorry - but they've all been the same length.
@doughtywench The point is they're better for hitting than anything else with similar dexterity, a category into which hooves do not fall.
@5mudje Who does?
i.e. the penultimate episode is today at 10.25pm and the last one of this series is tomorrow, Christmas Eve, at 10pm. Both on Channel 4.
Today's Peep Show is on at the slightly later time of 10.25pm. Next Sunday's is on at the slightly earlier time of 10pm the previous Monday.
Seeing as it's nearly Christmas I've written my Observer column this week about car insurance. http://t.co/3Cvi5zPo
... so, like a war never turns out to be, it'll all be over by Christmas #peepshowislikeawarneverturnsouttobe
Peep Show scheduling news (to me): I've just realised the last 2 eps of the series are on tomorrow &amp; Christmas Eve NOT tomorrow &amp; next Sun..
Seeing as it's the season of retail, here's a free clip of my audiobook. Maybe it'll tempt you to buy the whole thing. http://t.co/afUnbqq2
Meanwhile in Peep Show (C4, 10pm), Mark swaps a sexy woman for an alcoholic paint-drinking decorator. He always makes good choices.
My Observer column today points out that if Ed Miliband was ACTUALLY like Wallace, he'd be a lot more electable. Sadly. http://t.co/4VHCtfrx
@AndrewMason28 I need to live another 300 pages first.
@Gemmasaidso Is it okay if we put that on the cover of the paperback?
@smac91 No, actually, it was Watford. But I'm glad to hear they're similar - lessens the regret of being under-travelled.
@ChrisLewis_UK Thanks, but I really shouldn't.
@MarkEllett @rebeccaellett Happy birthday. And happy Christmas while I'm here.
@RobWilden I got married. #1970sQuip
@keirshiels @Foyles That's a very disappointing chart placing. I was hoping for "urbane / hipster".
@PeterBradshaw1 Thanks Peter, that's very nice of you to say.
@ChrisMarlton Thanks, glad you liked it (I'm inferring you liked it).
@SiMinty13 I'm sorry and pleased to hear it in equal measure. And I do hope you avoid dry rot - it's a bugger.
@fword85 Neither really.
@RickDubya Thank you!
RT @qikipedia New QI tonight, 10pm BBC2! @stephenfry &amp; @alandavies1 joined by @SarahMillican75, @RealDMitchell &amp; @RevRichardColes for JOBS!
@Kerrie_chaffey Precisely.
@sawyer250 Sorry to hear you were mugged. A judge telling a pickpocket they were gentle &amp; discreet would be a splendid judicial compliment.
@boodleoops Thanks, I'm very flattered to hear it's of educational use!
@ptrichardsonuk Quite. Glad to hear you agree.
@stephenfry Thanks! I'm extremely glad you liked it.
In tonight's Peep Show (C4, 10pm), Mark gets to cower in a ditch with a druggie. #livingthedream
@blue439 Thanks very much! Hope you had a good trip.
@johnandkatewedd Well done on getting married John and Kate, I'm all in favour of that.
@Lepista No, bravery is doing what you find frightening. You've described selflessness. Your disgust is disproportionate and unjustified.
@CaptnHollister I noticed a marked improvement after a couple of months. (Two months more and the marks had gone.)
@boodleoops If only he didn't read The Star.
@SimonTeapot I recorded that audiobook solely in the hope someone would listen to it in Mumbles while having a Joe's.
I'm back in the Observer today, complaining that judges don't pay criminals enough compliments: http://t.co/lIGCXX8Q
After today's awful news, I'm sure we won't now discuss the royal baby on HIGNFY. Luckily, the chancellor's autumn statement is hilarious.
@DeanSchorah I missed an s. Here it is: s.
@DeanSchorah Thank! Very glad to hear that.
@dlfTheCritic Thanks for the plug!
On an unrelated note, I'm hosting Have I Got News For You on BBC1 at 9pm. We'll over-discuss the over-discussion of the royal pregnancy.
There's a great charity, run by @thefridgeman, called "Tennis For Free" which aims to provide just that. Can you help? http://t.co/kE6qFl9s
@harryhurlock Well, I've just checked it. Very nice to meet you too. Thanks for coming to the show.
@munkikt Thanks! And don't worry, there's a gangway on the same floor as the kitchen. I didn't have to peer into an upper floor.
@LilJerseyDevil Thanks! And good question.
@rossboyle28 That's just what I tweeted someone about that very fact. 27k felt like loads then.
@oana_m Yes - times change.
@Ax_Smiffy Happy birthday!
@goodverbiage Thank you! She is brilliant.
@farstepper Thanks! I'm extremely glad you liked it.
@nozkel I really don't think so.
@BarnwoodBrixton Super.
@shotsir DO take it seriously. It's the only way to take it.
@TheMitchellMob You're very kind - but I'll never win.
@EthanSpier Thanks! Glad you liked it.
@misspurple72 Happy birthday!
@sassytal Thank you! I'm really glad you liked it. And I hope someone feels like that about you one day too. I'm sure they will.
The National Book Awards are tonight and "Back Story" is nominated! But I haven't been invited, which isn't a great sign. #goodnewsbadnews
@Ludicrousitys "Decline and Fall" is my favourite.
@samellis564 New!
In Peep Show tonight, Mark finally gets his "Business Secrets of the Pharaohs" out. (You're allowed to show them post-watershed.) C4, 10pm
I'm being quiet because I'm on honeymoon, but Mark Corrigan isn't - in so many ways. Peep Show's back on Channel 4 tonight at 10pm.
My trouble phrasing things is also to the fore in this half-arsed wedding week column about politicians and giraffes. http://t.co/YJaSb05F
Thanks so much for all the lovely tweets about our wedding yesterday. Having trouble phrasing it but the gist is: I'm incredibly happy.
@CarlosTehJackal I hope so.
@amandastaf I'm very glad to hear it - unless you're saying it's somehow killing sheep.
@mollinder Happy birthday!
@robinjava I am SO sorry.
@EJHil Glad you like it!
@DeputyMitchell @mishcamucka Well, that clears up that mystery.
@Sonic_TitanMA Thanks for inventing a drinking game for my book! You might sober up towards the end when the Fawlty references dwindle.
@roxymead That's a very old picture. The hand on my shoulder is @MrHolness.
@DiKetian Hope you like it.
@ladywiththehair Thank you!
Here's another free clip from my audiobook. Like they say with smack, the 1st fix is free. Unlike smack, so is the 2nd. http://t.co/q0DbvCV5
@callmefossie I do indeed. Some say I mention it too often. http://t.co/gln0HSck
@mishcamucka I'm sorry to say it but I don't think I have any Walsall dates in January.
@Mykemyday Thank you - very nice of you to say.
@FrontRowHomeEnt I don't think I should be your target market.
@CarlMaloney Thanks! Very glad to hear it.
@milliemoof I'm afraid not. They don't let you keep the outfits.
@mckeownaj Well, I'm not the novelist.
@EliasGlasch I'm very glad to hear it. It's so much less ambiguous than 'balls'.
@PeterBradshaw1 Thanks, Peter - I'm very glad you liked it.
@chrisajuk Thanks - glad you enjoy them.
@zbeauvais You're welcome - I'm very glad you liked it.
@hannah_rettoun Probably - but the dates won't be announced for a while.
@justfeltlikeit1 That's a very good analogy.
@johnnycandon Very glad you like it. And I'm both surprised and pleased that you find it erotic.
@caroline301059 Thank you! What a nice thing to say! I'm very glad you enjoyed it.
@briclondon No they all are, I think. Not actual peers but they get the courtesy titles.
@_stanners_ Don't thank me, thank Jan.
@iainkevanmorris How did you answer? I mean, I am the author of that book but not, in the broader sense, an author. Hope you're enjoying it.
My Observer column is about Downton Abbey and the magic of Lady Edith becoming real. http://t.co/svrq1DpB
@EdwardVanish No. I THINK it wasn't but "sure" is not an accurate description of my state of mind Twitter-wise at the moment.
It's about flaws in the opposing concepts of living in the moment and planning ahead. No useful conclusions are drawn. http://t.co/BALGkDCp
This week's Soapbox is the LAST IN THE SERIES! But, fear not, it will remain online for ever for historians of the future to sneer at.
@mrianleslie Oddly I think I'd be less worried if there was LOTS of evidence, or NO evidence. This tiny amount of evidence is eerie.
So I've changed it, but the only evidence of hacking I can find is that my tweet about my Observer column last Sun has disappeared. Weird.
Got an e-mail from twitter telling me that my password had to be changed because they thought my account had been hacked. (cont.)
@jamiesmouth You're welcome. My advice would be to try and put a show on at the Edinburgh Fringe. That's what Rob and I did.
@benwillbond Look, what can I say? I wish @Mitchellscup well. But I just can't work with him anymore.
@Benjamin_Woods And less fictional. Glad you like it.
@LikeIRoll Thanks! Although, as someone who works in television, I feel I should encourage people to watch the adverts.
@____Mac____ Glad you're enjoying the book but sorry you're more like me than is optimal.
@j4eyes1 Very nice of you to say, thank you.
@jobsta Thanks! Very glad you're enjoying it.
@darrenrichman Thanks Darren - very glad you like it. And yes, maybe I should have a Happy Meal for my 40th.
Here's a free clip of my audiobook: http://t.co/DRkl2N95. A full transcript of the audiobook is also available. #wishtherewasanameforthat
@polmanof Thanks! Very glad it made you laugh.
@vanawillemiel I don't think it contained any plot spoilers, did it? Hope not.
@JBallSweatt It's not all ranty but there's a bit of that. Hope you enjoy it, anyway.
@colemanmaak Thanks - very nice of you to say. Glad you enjoyed it.
@GeorgeDiane Thanks! Very glad it's striking a chord.
My Observer column this week is about Star Wars and James Bond. #tryingtoohard http://t.co/7bZSxR31
This week's Soapbox is about the little narrative signals that we all send each other. #PLEASESAYWEALLDOIT! http://t.co/q47raebQ
@eehouls Glad you're enjoying it.
@Jordaneer_Beth Don't really have a target audience. I just write things I hope I'd find funny or interesting. So maybe my target is me.
@TheMRipley Thank you! Very kind of you to tweet that. I'm glad you liked it.
@Herring1967 Resign!
@Jordaneer_Beth Thank you, that's very nice of you to say. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
@Dave__Bailey Thanks! I may now retire.
@Johnny_Two_Dogs Happy birthday (for yesterday)! @HeftyPorker
@RobJohnson23 Thanks! And very glad it covers familiar ground.
@Amy_LouiseP Hello Dan Groom. Is that a "shout out"?
@thenataliegail Not seen it, I'm afraid.
@thenataliegail My prediction is that you'll enjoy the brie more.
@zwizh Hope that means you're enjoying it rather than torturing yourself with it.
It's heartening that, in these troubled times, the most popular article on the BBC news website is "Hedgehog trapped in crisp packet".
@mrted52 Thanks! And sorry about your awful week.
@ChelleNZ Thank you! And I'm glad I'm an endearing cunt sayer.
@richfordbabe Thank you! I'm very glad you liked it.
@canstead Thank you! I'm really glad you enjoyed it. And Quex is a brilliant name.
I genuinely thought that was me. RT @Danorak1981 @realdmitchell David Mitchell? In Fresh Prince of Bel Air? WTF!?! http://t.co/xmb4iOF9
@sebastianmaxe I'm sorry to hear it. I wish Scandinavian broadcasting deals were within my sphere of influence.
@g_gtag Hardly ever.
@bobbiebarr Sorry to hear it. Hope the walking helps.
@liamsullivan I think it just helps because it gradually strengthens the muscles which hold the spine in place.
@nadia_dahabiyeh Yes, it was very nice thanks.
@ianto007 There already is one: http://t.co/BnGVpBNe
@Tallaght24 You'd be surprised.
@saffie Spectacle is difficult to achieve on radio.
@tomaldo13 Not unless they show repeats of "Mock the Week".
@laurenlive I'm extremely impressed that you know how to do that even if I suspect it's slightly illegal.
@TomosST5 Well I read all books like that, so I'd say it is. Glad you're enjoying it.
@MagentaPurple2 Thanks on both counts!
I'm just about to be on @richardpbacon's Radio 5 Live show. So do tune in, or switch off, depending on how that information makes you feel.
@BBCBreakfast Thank you for having me and for being so nice.
@meegan_eliza Well done, the Amazonians! Hope you enjoy it.
I'm being interviewed on BBC Breakfast this morning. Should be on just after 9. And I've just eaten a croissant too quickly. #pastryburp
Where have all the heroes gone? My Observer column thinks the answer is probably "into IT". http://t.co/g66TSjn1
Do I need to turn up now? #iwillturnup RT @waterstonesl1 Is that @realdmitchell? No, but he will be here at 2pm today! http://t.co/qxrx4FFr
@timbo_baggins I didn't say it automatically made him a pap. I'm just saying that, in this imagined case, he has become one.
@SharonTyrell I'm backstage. Very glad there is a queue!
@Kateannew That must be one of the funniest headlines I've ever read.
... which proves that Prince Philip is a new man, whatever people say.
En route to Lancaster for a book talk at the Grand Theatre, 2pm. Never been there before but I'm impressed to hear the Queen is duke of it.
@Pkirby4 I see what you mean, but I wonder how that logic is bearing up for you now.
@mr_space_ham Thanks! Very nice of you to say - on all counts.
@kirigordon I wish I knew.
@tatetown That would be an odd tweet taken out of context.
@ladyofleisure12 You're welcome! Thanks for being a great interviewer.
@cannahhook You're welcome. Hope you enjoy it.
@DamonLarge Of course they can! Isn't that partly what Twitter's for?
@phoneticerror You're welcome - it was great fun. Thanks for organising it.
This week's Soapbox is about Richard III's recent comeback. http://t.co/jXU2QyXv
@mjbrassill Not at all - and glad you liked the book.
@Herring1967 That Shrek doesn't look well.
@Lucys_mumbles I didn't realise we were being upstaged by God the whole time.
@Like_stars Well done for being the first to ask that! Glad you like the book.
@jennawimshurst Not at all - best of luck! @Baddiel
@debs_rodgers Not at all - thanks for coming.
@sammi_jane Thank you, I'm very glad to hear it.
@realpaulkenny Wasn't my decision but you're quite right. Same as calling comedy shows 'funny' in advance. Have to wait and see.
@jhopkin1 HELLO.
@alw_Audio It certainly will.
@zhandlen Thanks so much - I'm glad you enjoyed reading it (or me reading it out anyway).
@RyanSThornton Thanks! I'm really glad you're enjoying it.
@UnusedPortion And that includes me.
@robotophile You're welcome - hope you enjoy it.
I'll be recording Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre podcast tonight at the Leicester Square Theatre with Richard Herring. #concise
@nufccat I can't watch it. It just makes me think about what might have been.
@chrishoy Oh yes! There are electrolytes in wine, right?
@DezB27 I did precisely that yesterday.
@bigdogjeffery I don't blame you. That picture of my face is much bigger than my actual face.
@chrishoy Thanks, Chris! It turned out to be sportier than most of my TV appearances.
@190Colditz Yes, I rather regretted saying that as soon as I had.
@Rover9495 Good. I think it's kinder that way.
@CountessDuBlush So did I.
@ElaineLPrado Thank you!
@mr_seanhughes Excellent! I might bring out a detergent.
@LegOfPanda Thanks - very glad you're enjoying the book. You have an interesting name, if I may say so.
@blearyboy @george_stones Thank you! Very nice to meet you. I enjoyed our extremely public chat.
@David_Pearson_1 Not in the immediate future. Maybe when the paperback comes out?
@DavidAllenGreen Thanks - very glad you approve.
@biff_sweetwater Thanks. And glad you like the spoon sketch.
@murphyz Yes. And it wouldn't be the first time.
@Walpie27 I don't think so, I'm afraid.
My Observer column: equip the police properly to protect them from blind OAPs limping terrifyingly away from them. http://t.co/Fb4Zianx
On my way there now. RT @WaterstonesYork Today, 2pm - @RealDMitchell will be signing in our store - see you there?
I'm on The Jonathan Ross Show tonight at 10.20pm on ITV1. I've hardly ever been on ITV so I'm quite excited.
@Michael_42 @BlackwellEdin I'll have a go.
@AndyGait @BlackwellEdin No, they'll belong to whoever's bought them.
@mistersuperstar Well...
@Al83white Yes - although we often come to similar conclusions.
@mistersuperstar Best wishes to you.
@jameswalkerguy Definitely fine.
@TomosST5 Yes, next Sunday at Waterstones, Liverpool One - at 2pm.
@realnickheath No, Numberwang is 0 things about the number 43.
@SahraAFC Sorry, I didn't see your tweet. That's if you sent one? Maybe you expected me to know? Belated happy birthday!
@philcohenCTID Did he? Well, yes that is a coincidence then.
@bobsyerunkle Train.
@JosephRorke At least I'll know why.
This week's Soapbox is about what I'm currently on my way to Edinburgh to do. http://t.co/WElGtmDH
In Edinburgh tomorrow for a signing at Blackwell's at 3.30pm and a Q&amp;A at the Assembly Rooms at 7.30pm. Details here: http://t.co/lEMNKnQF
Really enjoyed @Baddiel's stand-up show, at the Soho theatre last night. And everything in it is true, which is a terrifying thought.
Please note RT @HarperCollinsUK: AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS  http://t.co/6N6LStCG
@amanda742 I think toast is a delicious thing to be.
@DanThomasUK Yes it is.
@samkalbag Thanks! I'm very glad to hear it.
@Baddiel @wisebee @PiccadillyLoves @HarperCollinsUK I initially read that as "singing". Was slightly alarmed. Signing's much better.
Just off to Oxford for a book signing in Waterstones at 1pm. It's my home town, so I'm hoping at least my mum will turn up.
@CarolineTimes7 I'll happily sign it if you buy mine as well.
@sunlightdan Thank you! Very nice of you to say.
@Laisey Yes, I am: http://t.co/p7NwBUa8.
@andrew_greening Thanks! I think I'd have put the Jimmy S thing differently if it had gone to print more recently.
@VashtarInShed Thank you! Really glad you're enjoying it.
@ChelseyBloomerz Yes, in Waterstones at 1pm.
@HollyKMSimmons I'm sure you will be. I'm just heading to Oxford now.
@KateHodkinson94 Bunk off.
@dan_oufc Tomorrow evening: http://t.co/EVlow1zg
@t1harold Yes indeed - tomorrow evening.
To be honest, I'll be doing that whether or not you're in Oxford. But if you're in Oxford, you could come along. That's what I meant.
Also, if you're in Oxford tomorrow, I'll be signing copies of my book at Waterstone(')s on Broad Street from 1pm.
The answers to the Soapbox Emotional Intelligence Quiz are out: http://t.co/lnxa6PfX. Please note they are NOT a matter of opinion.
@collectionpoint I'm not sure that counts as a prophecy but I'm very glad you're enjoying it.
@WaterstonesFest You're welcome - it was fun.
@Keris Thanks! I'm very glad you liked it and appreciate the Google Maps attention to detail.
@GetItQuietly Entirely reasonable. Everyone gets taught not to judge a book by its cover.
@TempleG Thank you! And it was very sunny actually.
@MollyCobain31 Yes.
@Nathanisatwit They're very welcome. It's a brilliant pub.
@chrisbeach Sorry to have made you sad but I don't think it was disingenuous - I was being sincere. I can't agree that it's a decent policy.
@LPOWZZ I expect I'll be signing some on both occasions.
@collectionpoint You live and learn.
@swezRS Thanks for coming to the event. Very glad you enjoyed it.
@RebeccaFront Thanks!
Meanwhile I'm on my way to Cheltenham to talk about my book at the literary festival. Hope the audience don't all think it's Cloud Atlas.
In the Observer today, I tentatively conclude that George Osborne may not have the country's best interests at heart. http://t.co/hHMiiN3O
Here's this week's Soapbox, which calls on people to be honest about what really bothers them. http://t.co/Is4arR3I
@SamanthaEllis27 Thanks Sam!
So today I'll be talking about it endlessly on Steve Wright in the Afternoon (R2), on Front Row (7.15, R4) and on stage (7pm, Shaw Theatre).
I've published a book today! I got up early to publish it and now it's all published. I'm a manufacturing success story. #appleofcameronseye
It's at @truthontv &amp; features the likes of @graemegarden1 and @craigreucassel @andrewjhansen @julesmorrow from @chaser (9.30pm, Channel 7).
The Unbelievable Truth starts on Australian TV tonight (or indeed this morning UK time, but then it's not on here so that's irrelevant)!
@DanTharley You can certainly buy it, not sure if it's on iTunes as well: http://t.co/c0d7CFt5
@Sahra16AFC Yes there will.
@adsynergy There's a video on the Amazon page.
@ParadoxicalBlue There already is one: http://t.co/c0d7CFt5
@DanDoolan It's a comedy involving sex. Funny sex.
@sophvn Excellent! You are indeed.
@Alexzandrea22 It's certainly a possibility.
@usul_of_arakis Happy 50th birthday!
Apologies in advance if you don't find the video amusing.
I've done an amusing video for my book's Amazon page: http://t.co/lwiy2Fc7. The book took longer but amusing videos tend to be more popular.
@stuartbarrmusic Very good to see you too, Stuart!
@lubzbee Yes there certainly will.
@thealexavery Yes, apparently I need a ticket to appear.
@eisforeloise What a very refreshing thing to see on Twitter.
@AldGra Very nice.
@DomOJFryer I am James Bond.
@catherinebray Thank you! Really glad you liked it.
@Isysuttie @KLister10 I also hope rather than know so. But I think it'll be some time next month.
@lubzbee Happy birthday!
@chrisvear Happy birthday, Chris!
@TimSuttonMusic Thanks Tim!
Going on This Morning this morning - I think I'm on in about 10 mins - to talk about my memoir. #ThisMorningthismorning
@RobBrydon Congratulations! I think that means you're officially a world religion.
@DeborahJaneOrr Not to worry - I didn't take it as a threat.
@aostalady If there's a place for me to sign some books afterwards, I certainly will.
@dontbridikerus Thanks you - and thanks for the psychic review.
@roisincrean Maybe one day but not for a while. Happy birthday though!
@Queen_Claire They don't. But then again, not many children get to choose their own diet however bright or stupid they are.
@DaveyDavies2100 Next month.
@JNRaeside Thanks!
@RobBrydon I see you were cannier than me and launched yours in New Zealand. http://t.co/rbIptGhM
If you're just settling down to a traditional Sunday bargain bucket, my column might help it go down. http://t.co/l2nEtijY
@Andyblake20 Next month, I think.
@DEANHDAVID Not necessarily. I'm only getting this from the internet myself.
@danhodkinson Some day soon and for the rest of my life.
I'm on a new QI tonight at 10pm on BBC2 (and then in extended form tomorrow at 9pm). @sueperkins and @KatyFBrand are the other guests.
@DanTharley Thank you!
@Dtothaj Yes, lots: http://t.co/p7NwBUa8.
@vicky_mcc Thanks - that's very reassuring!
@LachlanLoader Maybe one day but not in the next few weeks, I'm afraid.
@Freyaa113 She's right. I've let myself down.
In this Soapbox I address one of the easiest of all comedy subjects: freedom of religious choice. Broadly, I'm against. http://t.co/iuXO5WC4
@mjbrassill I'll tell you afterwards.
@profpieface Not currently an option.
@DeanSchorah I'm sure that'll be fine.
@rlivsey I'll be there - so that's three!
@MrCell0phane The excrement is descending on Friday 26th October. Details here: http://t.co/nC9gTGVd
@DewiCasgwent This the list: http://t.co/nC9gTGVd.
@ahonestmouthful No.
@siddif I agree.
@DeanSchorah You don't need tickets, it's a signing. It's at 2 o'clock at Waterstones, College Lane. http://t.co/nC9gTGVd
@DeanSchorah I am! On the 28th.
The 1st event is next Thurs at the Shaw Theatre in London. Get a ticket to see how I react when no one comes. #paradox http://t.co/x0d9lBcg
@LM_Marlow That would be much appreciated!
@ThatMrStirling My commiserations - it's horrible. (Sciatica, not the book.) (In my view.)
@DomMellin I'm on my way.
@SR_Penny Sorry - I didn't decide the schedule. Surely I must be going somewhere near one of them?
I'm doing some signings and Q&amp;A events around the launch of my book, "Back Story", details of which can be found here: http://t.co/nC9gTGVd
@hewhatblack I'm afraid I don't know the date yet.
