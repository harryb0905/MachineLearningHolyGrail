@nivacaine their standard account is $10 a month... $20 is for the high quality audio option.
@Nliddle16 @TIDALHiFi did you see when they were on stage &amp; Alicia Keys managed to say a whole lot of words without actually saying anything

#childhoodconfessionnight when I was like 15 I would wait until everyone was in bed then watch 'EuroTrash' lol!!!! #goodtimes
#childhoodconfessionnight my dad once let me chip golf balls at a bucket sat on top of my mums beloved piano... when i was like 12.
#childhoodconfessionnight I was pretty certain that if I slept with my hand over the side of the bed a monster was going to drag me under
#childhoodconfessionnight I was obsessed with tennis so much that I would follow Tim Henman's world ranking hourly on teletext.

@MarlinSB so what's your suggestion?
@MarlinSB I guess the difference between us is that I'm not willing to just accept that nothing can be done.
@MarlinSB stricter regulations on obtaining a firearm would be a good start in my opinion.
@MarlinSB I already told you what I think should be done.. I can't believe you wouldn't even try to prevent events like today from happening
@MarlinSB so you are saying just let this continue cos there's nothing we can do about it... Something must be done, don't you agree?
@JasonArthur7 we don't have these regular mass shootings in the UK... Cos the laws are stricter &amp; ppl can't easily just get hold of firearms
@MarlinSB guess we should just do nothing and wait for the next mass shooting then...?
@JasonArthur7 I'm not talking about hunting, I'm talking about people with a history of mental illness...
@MarlinSB  that's no argument not to have better gun control
