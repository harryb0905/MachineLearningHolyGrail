@TimDalton65 Hi Tim. I really believe that business can change the world for the better, but non-profits also have an important part to play. I’m sure 36 years has given you lots of experience on how things could be done better – now it’s your turn to try and make that happen. Best of luck.
@StephenCGreen22 It’s too early to tell, but a lack of personal connections could lead us to a less human world.
@nickgianis I hope you have found my replies useful and please – keep asking using the hashtag #askRichard and pick up your copy of #FindingMyVirginity here.
