MSNBC just gave a precise explanation of Trump's thinking:  'He views The Rule of Law as presidential harassment'  To comprehend this, remember Trump's life is built on the premise that there are no rules that apply to him.  He even cheats at golf  Everything follows from that

Thank you for this https://t.co/lFbG71WUUK
The Daily Mail has described my withdrawal from a loan negotiation with 23 Cap as behaving 'like Basil Fawlty'  That's their version. Mine follows  Remember that an anti-fake news organisation called NewsGuard recently gave Mail Online a trustworthiness rating of 1 star out of 5
The man most responsible for this ludicrous system is, of course, Paul Dacre, the foul-mouthed oafish ex-editor so admired by the rest of the British press  So much so that the London Press Club recently dubbed him the 'First Journalist Laureate'  You couldn't make it up.
The independent anti-fake news company NewsGuard has given Mail Online a rating of 1 out of 5 for trustworthiness  The reason the Mail organisation is so appalling is that it is regulated by IPSO, the body set up by the British Press to regulate the British Press  It's a joke

' Sexual behaviour is bad and disgusting and should be avoided. If you absolutely HAVE to have sex, it is JUST permissible, PROVIDED only that is within marriage, AND that the purpose of this reprehensible behaviour is PROCREATION ' So basically, if you enjoy it you're in trouble
So-called 'Christian' teaching about sex is in fact derived from the writings of St Augustine and Paul. They both had major problems with women. St Augustine had to leave Africa to escape from his mother. Paul's position on sex was as follows...
...' It's just that you keep showing me dirty pictures...'
A psychoanalyst shows a patient a Rorschach inkblot. 'What does it make you think of ?' he asks. 'Sex' the patient replies. He shows another. 'Sex' He shows a third '...Sex ' The psychoanalyst suggests the patient might be obsessed with sex. 'Not at all ! retorts the patient.....
How odd that Karen Pence thinks Christ's teaching is all about sex  I must check the New Testament again
The Executive Director of the Society of Editors, asked to comment on this, stated that any regulation of the press would put democracy in jeopardy  No, it would put British editors in jeopardy, as they run IPSO entirely in their own ruthless interests

...though this is a truth that many critics do not acknowledge  Above all, they should know that criticism is a never-ending learning process ; that they should struggle to avoid 'group think' ; and that they should give priority to the work in question, rather than to their ego
...and didn't succeed it, it should not diminish their love for it, or create resentment   They must try to talk to practitioners in order to understand the all-important creative and practical processes involved. Without this knowledge they cannot apportion praise or blame...
Certainly a critic must have a real love for the Art form they are critiquing. Enough to have worked in that art in a couple of ways, so that they have been able to watch it in practice, if not actually doing it themselves. If they did try to participate in the creative side..

As High Court evidence of the criminality of Tina Weaver builds up, Mail executives may be regretting they just hired her as a star columnist  She replaces the recently sacked Quentin Letts, the inspiration for the character of Piggy in "The Lord of the Flies"  Read @Byline_Media
I think PETA's suggested emendations to traditional old English sayings are pure parsnipshit
A clarification...  The Mr Hinton, who has written a book called 'Man or Monster' about a prison commandant for the Khymer Rouge, is not the same Mr Hinton who authored a book about his experiences working for Rupert Murdoch
Walking in Melbourne yesterday, I saw the menu for a Korean restaurant  Many of the dishes had spam in them  Could this be Korean spam ?
Is there any reason why President Trump can't pardon Mohammed bin Salman ?  That would sort everything out, wouldn't it ?  And Evangelists could view the whole transaction as an example of Forgiveness

NYC Twits !!  Tomorrow at 7.00pm I am being grilled by the brightest man I know, Iain McGilchrist, about my new book, which features talks and interviews I've given at Cornell in the last few years  It's at 150 W83rd st, and it's organised by Harper's Magazine
And another...  Where have you read in the UK Press about the present High Court trial in which Sun executives have been exposed as serial liars ?  I don't know where you get your slogans from, Geoff...  Not the real world, certainly
Here's another...  The European Broadcasting Union carries out annual polls about the level of trust that Europeans have in each of their county's printed media. THE UK HAS COME LAST ( OUT OF 33 COUNTRIES !)  FOR FOUR YEARS IN A ROW !!!  Where did you read about that, Geoff ?
Then how is, for example, that when John Ford confesses that for 15 years he carried out illegal activities at the behest of John Witheroe, then Editor of Murdoch's Sunday Times, the entire British press hushes up the story ? Welcome to the real world, Geoff  Need more examples ? https://t.co/MaRHj3fXu9
For even more evidence about the crooks at The Sun, see @Byline_Media   You won'e see it anywhere else, least of all on BBCNews
I see that research by Cambridge University and Yougov shows that 77% of Brits have 'little or no trust' in their journalists  This reflects the fact that the London Press  Club recently dubbed Paul Dacre the first 'Journalist Laureate'  It's hard being a comedian these days

Very sad about Bill Goldman  He was absolutely wonderful company. He knew more about movies than anyone I ever met  Of all his many his films, the one he loved the most was Princess Bride  That says a lot about him
So Murdoch wanted Gove to stay in the Cabinet  Same way he wanted Coulson in number 10  I wonder if Fox and the WSJ are fading ever so sightly in their support for Trump.  Would Murdoch be worse off with Pence ?
Could someone at the Guardian explain what its recent commercial arrangement with the Sun is all about ?  People I ask about this are really shocked, because, for some reason, they hadn't heard about it
I wonder what Murdoch will tell Gove to do...  Whatever it is, it will receive praise in the Times and the Sun, and also good reviews in the Mail from Gove's wife, and her pals  British journalism...

I would like to point out that Mr Trump's moves to unravel the whole system of international arms control treaties is entirely in accordance with the principles of the NRA
On the other hand...the various Inquisitions, despite their use of torture and their tendency to burn alive those who disagreed with them...did create a lot of jobs
I'm merely giving pointing out that Mr Trump is a sleazy, corrupt, egotistical and mendacious sociopath.  What I'm trying to understand is why Evangelicals approve of him.  Have they not read the New Testament ? Or do they think it's not meant to be taken literally ? https://t.co/okMeeIcSyX

GMB cut out the information I gave about Witherow using John Ford to get data unlawfully  I don't see that I'm under any obligation to hush up illegal activities, even if GMB does  And now that the Guardian has a commercial arrangement with the Sun, they will, too
The High Court in London heard today that Rebekah Brooks obtained unlawful data while she was a top Murdoch employee  More news on https://t.co/JgJTaSZQoL  There won't be any in the papers, of course. They'll hush this up like they did with John Witherow's illegal behaviour
What I love best about our Ryder Cup heroes is their obvious affection for each other. AND the fact that their wives get to be in the team photos, reminding us they they're part of the team too

More news about censorship by the British media !  They cut my interview from the ITV+1 showing of GMB, and they haven't put it on their ITV Hub catch-up service, as they would normally have done by now
It is just one more example of the censorship exercised by the British media  It's hypocritical to claim we have 'Free Speech' when the papers and TV conspire to hush that speech up  Maybe I should exercise my right to 'Free Speech' at Hyde Park Corner
I was puzzled this morning on GMB. When I raised the matter of John Witheroe's complicity in criminal activities while he was editor of the Sunday Times, I was told we couldn't discuss that as he was not there to defend himself  Neither was Donald Trump...
Delighted to hear that we raised over ONE MILLION POUNDS for the NSPCC's Childline last night  Our thanks to everyone at the Old Billingsgate Market who donated to this wonderful charity

Can you prove she was innocent ?  But you're right. We shouldn't make fun of the Russians' lying. Or anything else, for that matter, because it might just hurt somebody's feelings, somewhere, Even if they completely miss the point of the fucking joke https://t.co/dXJMCWPscw
I hadn't thought of that !   And if the Skripals deny this, they could be lying at the behest of UK intelligence, the very people who were really trying to kill them. And would do, if they said they had agreed to be poisoned  There's more here than meets the eye https://t.co/WX9IuyF2fi
Perhaps that was left over from another trip when he was assassinating someone officially ? https://t.co/J7lfk1UEM5
To be fair to Putin...  Just because one of the men who poisoned the Skripals was a Russian intelligence operator, it does not mean he was acting under orders. He may have really been an architectural tourist, who then decided at the last minute to do some freelance poisoning
Well done, Somerset ! Runners-up in the County Championship !  The Mangle Wurzel juice will flow tonight !
I thought that my increasing deafness would be a burden  On the contrary, I find it quite liberating. I smile and nod and point at my ears, and am thus released from the duty of taking notice of all the rubbish directed at me   Also, my wife has become really good at Dumb Krambo
My wife is feeling rather preoccupied this morning.  She fears she may have offended one of the cats
The Trumponicles XXVIII - THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE PUSILLANIMOUS REPUBLICAN MAJORITY GOES A PRESIDENT OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME https://t.co/D8fVRnBa8I via @MarvinKitman
I recommend a look at https://t.co/KyVNTWQX3y for anyone interested in getting proper, well researched, and honest news
I'm beginning to see how Trump got elected
One clue :  Remember that when John McEnroe started the fashion for behaving like a brat, he became a hero for many Americans  And a pariah in Europe
She behaves worse that anyone has ever has in a Grand Slam final. Amongst other things, she threatens the umpire that he will never umpire again  ( Do please check all this by watching the footage...)  My question is : How did she become a victim ?
When the umpire mentions this, she denies she would ever cheat in this way, raising the question ...why did her coach NOT know this ?  She argues a great deal. Later she smashes her racquet in anger, and the umpire, following the rules, docks her a point  She loses it completely
The famous athlete Serena Williams, winner of umpteen Grand Slams, plays in yet another Grand Slam final, as a red-hot favourite  But her opponent starts playing better than her  Her coach gestures to her to play further up court, and nods, as humans do after making eye contact
I try not to brag too much, but I have just heard wonderful news !  I made a speech recently at the Banqueting House in Westminster  Since then, the organisers have received a number of complaints from people who attended it  And...........they were ALL from Trump supporters !!
I like " Aluminum " even if it's wrong  I just wish you'd be consistent, and talk about Sodum, and Lithum and Potassum and Helum and Magnesum and Titanum and Chromum and Uranum.  Re: " Lieutenant " We decided to Anglicise it, instead of pronouncing it the French way, incorrectly https://t.co/DDHn1657rc
By mangling I mean Americans saying : " I could care less " when they mean to say : " I couldn't care less "  Or using" likely " as an adverb, just because it looks like one
Why is it that, if a single country takes a protectionist stance, it's always held to be bad, whereas if a group of 27 countries does the same, it's good ?
Talking of cultural appropriation, how do the left feel about the USA appropriating the English language as though it was their own ?  They have never paid a cent in royalties either  Nor does it ever occur to them to apologise ? Even if its only for the way they mangle it ?
Should Serena have been portrayed as smaller, and more ' European ' in features ? Or even a little more Japanese ? Or would that have been condescending ?  Theresa May's usual caricature emphasises her long pointy nose. Isn't this reinforcing the racial stereotype of ' Honky ' ? https://t.co/k01M05IEo0
I am in awe of great impersonators  In the last year, I have howled at Rory Bremner's Trump and Rob Bryden's Michael Caine   Today, on the set of 'Hold the Sunset', I heard Jason Watkins practising his Harold Wilson ( He's filming 'Crown" at the same time )  Absolutely wonderful

As the world goes madder ( in the English sense ) President Putin assures the world that the two men who flew to the UK to murder the Skripals are not criminals, only 'civilians'  Just a couple of ordinary, everyday, innocent Russians going abroad on a package poisoning holiday
With regard to Serena Williams, I think it unfair that any US citizen should be expected to behave better than the President  Also, it's silly to forbid caricaturists to exaggerate features.That's what they do. It's what makes them caricaturists. If they didn't, they wouldn't be
Yes, well, they are the ones with the guns, aren't they ? https://t.co/sECbVHlOvn

Joke of the day !  How can you tell whether someone is vegan ?  Answer: Because they tell you... again, and again, and again  And again
President Trump forecasts violence if the Democrats win the mid-term elections. This, apparently, will come from the left wing  But wouldn't the left be more upset if they LOST ? Surely WINNING would reduce their bloodlust...  So, to assure a less violent America, vote Democrat
The best line from the Watergate affair came when Ron Ziegler, Nixon's press secretary, caught out in a blatant lie, replied " That statement is no longer operative " Equally hilarious is Trump's defence team's position that taking an oath to tell the truth is " a trap "
@homers1mpson Having paid the top rate of tax  ( in either the UK or the US ) for 52 years, and as I am turning 80 next year, I feel I've done my share  Also, it will give me a chance to give money to charities I approve of, instead of to our dreadful government
It occurs to me that someone unconcerned by rules ( even the Rule of Law ) is unlikely to surround himself with persons of high moral character, since he would constantly be in conflict with them  The title of James's book is "Assholes"
Re-reading a very interesting book by the philosoper Aaron James. It's a psychological investigation of the mental processes of the typical "Asshole" The asshole's chief characteristic seems to be a belief that no rules apply to him. He becomes aggressive if this is challenged
Interesting that the Republicans, the party of smaller government, are now busily establishing an autocracy  I guess having just one person in charge is as small as a government can get
Yes, I'll be there at 4.00pm Friday, chatting to the splendid Peter Jukes https://t.co/XCFymptiXU

I had lunch with Michael Palin last week at his club, the Aetheaneuam  He's so nice that I fell asleep during my main course  I was pleased to note that the waiters aren't as rude as they used to be
Sarah Huckabee has announced that nobody with government experience will be allowed to read classified information showing that the President is going insane  Smart move. The greedy rich don't care and his base can't even see that professional wrestlers are very bad actors
Went to the BA counter yesterday to check in, and handed over my passport. The nice BA lady looked at it and said ' You're not as pretty as that '  I'd taken my wife's passport  Lots of laughs and a 20 hour journey to Nevis  Worth it though. A haven in a batty world...

Incidentally, while we are on the subject, Jean Moir, who chided me for my 'failure' to sell more than 60,000 copies of my autobiography, might care to know that sales now exceed 600,000  I'm sure she'll want to let her readers know she misinformed them
The only wagging tongues I've heard are speculating how a disgusting, cruel, sociopathic bitch like Katie Hind could be allowed to publish such malignant rubbish in the name of journalism  No wonder the MoS is scared of Leveson 2
So Katie Hind is suggesting that these two old friends might go about breaking up their stable relationships in a sudden of of sexual passion occasioned by his authorship of this book  How dare she !  How dare she claim that 'tongues are wagging'  It's lying, sociopathic crap
Minnie and her friend have now been in stable relationships for some years.  Nevertheless, Katie Hind speculated that because the friend had written a book about the Sexual Revolution in America, ' things might work out this time "  Meaning that they might have a fling...
Last weekend, the MoS told Minnie Driver they had 'compromising' photos of her with an old friend  In the event they published a photo showing they weren't even HOLDING HANDS.  Of course they cropped the photo so that it looked as though they might have been !  Standard MoS lying

If anyone does not believe me, please read the excellent 'Mail Men' by Adrian Addison
I have an explanation of the MoS's behaviour. The journalists at the Mail papers live in such a nasty, toxic atmosphere, that any sign of affection must seem to them deeply suspicious  A BBC journalist told me recently that the Mail employees he meets always seem close to tears
Minnie and her friend had not seen each other for ages. He came on set and then they walked to lunch. At one point, he put an arm round her, and at the end of the meal they hugged  The MoS pertrays this as infidelity  It's the kind of grubby, cruel, pointless lie we all despise
I hear the Mail on Sunday is threatening to run a hatchet job on Minnie Driver, with whom I've been working this week. They are pretending that a photo of her having lunch with an old friend is 'compromising'  They are disgusting sociopaths. Please let them know what you think
Sad day for the Cleeses  Camilla's cat Misty died yesterday. When Camilla and I toured New Zealand in 2006 we had a finale where we fired cats out of a cannon  ( Or pretended to )  Misty was one of them. We bought her at the end of the tour and she has lived with Camilla since...

I see Jeremy Hunt, a star in May's cabinet, referred to his wife as "Japanese ", while speaking in Beijing  She is, in fact, Chinese  I sympathise. I often refer to my wife as " Japanese ", when she was, in fact, born on the Isle of Sheppey. It's a mistake that's easily made...

Interesting that the latest poll shows that the public gives 86% backing to the Court's decision about Cliff Richard  Our grubby press are 100% against it, of course. It threatens their ability to publish unchecked gossip, without which their coverage would dwindle  Deservedly...
And when the Daily Mail calls this ' an extraordinary outburst ', please remind them that 86% of the British public agrees with me

To the British, a ‘ Gentleman ' is a man who is modest, well-mannered, self deprecating, quietly intelligent, considerate of other people’s feeling, and well-informed.
The fact is that the British loathe Donald Trump  This is because he is the polar opposite of a ‘ Gentleman ‘, who has qualities the British admire. A fine example is Gareth Southgate.
Pronoid is the opposite of paranoid. A paranoid person thinks, without any basis in reality, that everybody is out to get them. A pronoid person is someone who thinks, without any .basis in reality, that everybody likes them
My American friends are asking me about President Trumps’s observation that the British ‘like him’.  I regret this is quite unfounded.  The explanation for this canard is that Trump is pronoid.

Yes, but they'll be so fat from guzzling pate and cheese and chocolate that they won't have the mobility to bother us https://t.co/kXOexGFjwM
I know  But I'd rather have Columbia than Brazil https://t.co/LHDLDVgfL9
You should have been a lawyer  Or are you ? https://t.co/AlIG4T3Y8r
Many congratulations to the Fat, Lazy, Pate-Guzzling, Walloon-Flemish Bastards, who finally got up off their barrage-balloon arses to humble Gareth's Plucky Minnows...  Good luck against Brazil !   Suckers !!!!  And, if we meet again, we'll be fielding our FIRST Eleven...
Dear Bert  May I borrow your name for a week ? I will pay well  And thanks for explaining the point of my Belgian joke to Ms Beddington.   British journalists like her are so busy looking for negatives, that they constantly misread subtler ironies https://t.co/DclRV4W9P9
I've been sent the Guardian piece by Emma Beddington about my silly Belgian insults  It's the standard mixture of misinformation, faux-indignation, and missing the point. The direct result of copying things from the Internet without bothering to check them  Further comment later
I'd never noticed... https://t.co/w1Y16Z824x
I'm relieved that someone is satisfied with the situation in our country... https://t.co/p64SWOXHm4
I accept your chastisement. At the time I was suffering from a surfeit of lampreys https://t.co/d5teGlRhlH
Not for ever though. Just while we don't have the lest trusted printed media in Europe, and the most despised government of my lifetime, and City of London bankers that are number one in laundering Russian dirty money https://t.co/2NJ0ipM3lV
" We all know the batty Dacre was forced out, and would have been years ago if Rothermere had testicles instead of apricots. I fart in the direction of all his hard- inherited yachts "
I would taunt them with...  " Write your own jokes, you purveyors of wiping material for other peoples' bottoms.Your Dacre is a psycho, and your owner was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and should have swallowed it "  Then I'd add...... https://t.co/zJ67fcKni0
I see you're a hard Cheese https://t.co/ROwHOa2fJc
Oh yes ! Lots !  But, sadly, all of them are Daily Mail readers, which explains it... https://t.co/BbvQIvxrlX
Old Python jokes about Belgians, and other peoples' social media comments  The Mail journalists are not a cheerful lot. A BBC journalist tells me they always seem on the verge of tears. But Dacre pays well for 'writers' at their low level.  Like Muir, Shakespeare, Morgan, McKay https://t.co/jCucSBDLHy
Pleased to see this. Cary emailed me two days ago ! https://t.co/klzFLl926C
I am in the middle of making the necessary arrangements.  I have to film the second series of 'Hold the Sunset', and so will be off at the beginning of November https://t.co/MzBvxTqtHJ
The Mail has been stealing Python material again  It must be nice to be a 'journalist' who can sit at a desk all day with their coffee and just copy down other people's words, while adding the odd cliche here and there  Can't they afford anyone who can amuse wihout plagiarising ?
Also, I want to kill this rumour that James Cosmo has reported me for inappropriate touching. I simply slipped
I'm worried what Shane Head of BBC comedy thinks about ' Hold the Sunset '  It's very white and lower middle class and rather lacking in grammatical mistakes and heavy accents. I'd have guessed he was more ashamed of it than Monty Python.  Still it does have lots of girlies in it
No. A nasty slur on the handicapped !  Get your priorities right... https://t.co/vW8Q9gwUj3
Very perceptive... https://t.co/by4espwoLR
Which is why the BBC, who have full terrestrial rights to broadcast it, hasn't done so for...17 years ?  Odd, isn't it ?   Especially was we use to get £240 PER PERFORMANCE !! https://t.co/K3ZWPEblgL
You're absolutely right. Jonesy was sort of Welsh, although he grew up in Kingston-on-Thames,where he soon lost his accent  Another multi-culturist icon... https://t.co/y3XSmMIm1A
Just two public schoolboys sharing an 'in' joke. Sad, really  Apologies for the inherent racism... https://t.co/fmF5vvHuKL
Be fair. There are lots of people who think it's funny. Bless them... https://t.co/OFwb3CW1Zf
His real title is " Head of Social Engineering "  Which is an excellent enterprise, although not very closely connected to comedy.   If fact, it's almost exactly its polar opposite... https://t.co/b8dWhVuX4p
I'll be delighted to read your book.   And to interview you, for my exciting new podcast...something or other  So Charity schools were less privileged then Grammar schools, were they ?  Where are you, right now ? https://t.co/5ubC4HRnod
Some Comedy History  When Python started, the Head of Light Entertainment loathed it, and at a Heads of Department meeting, six of them disliked it. Only Desmond Wilcox, out of eight, approved  So Allen is just the latest in a long line who don't really know what they're doing
An ex-Yank https://t.co/4U5DNSuGno
We were never ashamed to reveal the more feminine side of our personalities  AND...to demonstrate solidarity with all suffragettes, 91,6% of the people we ridiculed were male ( in the old-fashioned sense, that is ) https://t.co/KSdp7IyRU1
BBC's Head of Comedy puts Monty Python's lack of originality down to a surfeit of education and racist bias   Unfair ! We were remarkably diverse FOR OUR TIME   We had three grammar-school boys, one a poof, and Gilliam, though not actually black, was a Yank. And NO slave-owners
I'm told of a lame put-down by the Mail yesterday, in one of its many attack-puppy columns  Peter McKay had his own column taken away by Paul Dacre some time ago, and his writing has never been the same. But then, it never was  So he will remain Ebeneezer Hardstuff for ever...
Are you by any chance related to Oscar Wilde ? https://t.co/g4XPu0j38Z
An apology to the citizens of Hasselt  It was quite wrong of me to describe them as pseudo-French  They are, of course, pseudo-Dutch

I think the Beatitudes are an encouragement for us to work on lessening the power of our egos, not to enhance them https://t.co/ki6DCjH3UL
Following this White House reminds me of the story of the mother watching her soldier son on a military march-past. ' Ooh, look at him ! ' she exclaims proudly, ' He's the only one in step '
This is a compliment of such extravagance that I cannot resist re-cycling it https://t.co/CzePTujGeb
Some people believe there was no such person as Jesus Christ  But I believe there were two !  The first is the one described in the Gospels ; the other is an American Evangelical idol, whose garment is made from a Confederate flag, and who regards the first as an unpatriotic wimp
The characteristic behaviour of one kind of right-wing journalist is to establish their Christian credentials, so that their egotism comes with a halo attached
Charles Moore's piece about Paul Dacre in the Spectator is a fine example of the mafia-like solidarity among British press moguls  They worship power and money, so their moral entitlement is nauseating  I hope Moore enjoys their socialising. It's time somebody called him a 'cunt'
Which episode ? https://t.co/lwPKdFiCu8
I thought the socceroos were terrific, and very unlucky https://t.co/PPR93ziaqo
No, no hookers,except for the victims of press abuse  Sorry to disappoint you. And to disappoint the papers too  They WOULD cover that story  And you, no doubt, would read it https://t.co/wFY3CdTGid
Such a bubble, that they seem unaware that in recent polls by the European Broadcasting Union, the UK is rated last in Europe, for trust in its printed media...for THREE YEARS IN A ROW !!!  Or, if they ARE aware, they clearly CENSOR THE STORY  Thus keeping us all in their bubble
I'm planning on doing a fund-raiser for Hacked Off on Sunday 8th July.  Details soon...
I see all the pieces written about Dacre are written by journalists.  They criticise everybody else - politicians, civil servants, the professions, athletes, charities - but the only people invited to criticise journalists are...journalists  Thus, they live in a complete bubble
Just finished 35th show of 35    Best audiences : Helsinki, Reykjavik, Bergen, Copenhagen, Zwolle, Hamburg, Cologne, Breda, Haarlem, Zurich, Frankfurt, Vienna and Zagreb  Worst : Lazy, fat, beer-sodden, pseudo-French Belgian bastards in Hasselt  Like reading Moby Dick to nomads
Love this World Cup !! Hooray for the minnows - Mexico, Iceland,Switzerland !  Good luck to Southgate's Minnows too !!
Oh, that too.   Then we'll know for sure which bribe he accepted https://t.co/WIjvxTazv2
The first game of the World Cup : Russia vs Saudi Arabia  The referee will be able to retire tonight...
But, in addition, very much admired by other dictators, and also a hero among people who equate financial success with greatness. Like the mafia and drug barons "Where there's muck, there's brass" Never more true than in Fleet Street...
I see a former Fleet Street editor calls Paul Dacre ' a very great man'  Of course, I realise that the opinion of people who only read newspapers is valueless. Nevertheless I'd just like to put in a word for Josef Stalin  He was a very great man, also much maligned by his victims
Of course the real reason the right likes strong one-party government is that the leader can do SECRET shady deals, like the ones May concluded with Murdoch and Dacre, before she changed her mind about holding the last election
I'm old enough to remember that the right-wing press used to oppose Proportional Representation. on the grounds that it would lead to 'weak' coalition governments  I don't make the jokes, I just point them out. ( Will Rogers )
Dear Witch,  I'm afraid the subjunctive is much too sophisticated for People of the Right. If they could just manage honest patois, it would be a big step forward in getting them to change their voting patterns https://t.co/W3NLTBJKbO
Happiness is knowing Paul Dacre is going to 'step down'  But ecstasy would be a paparazzi picture of him with a stake through his heart
It's comforting to know that although Trump treats the leaders of democratic countries with contempt, he can really hit it off with dictators  After all, they're the really dangerous ones...
Yes !   I apologise to ordinary, hard-working, tax-paying,mediocre people, with whom I am proud to claim comradeship https://t.co/VHKfANN9c3
Isn't it odd that the tweets sent by people of the right usually contain a grammatical error, or a logical one  If 'their' so patriotic, why don't they learn to speak the language properly ? https://t.co/FoHKNHZLFV
Very good  Miller is Central Casting's top choice for Nazi interrogator https://t.co/2W0wwnYsJX

There I am, always forgetting that two wrongs make a right https://t.co/Jj1MltyIls
Watching Trump's attack dogs reminds us that, under authoritarian leadership, a total mediocrity can rise to the very top, since the only attribute he needs is obedience
So Trump's mouthpieces are saying he was stabbed in the back  I suppose he was setting a better example when he stabbed the other G7 leaders in the front
Congratulations to all Scotland's cricketers ! What a win ! What a surprise !  I think the only thing that would surprise me more is if they beat England at football...
I find it genuinely fascinating that so few people are really concerned about it. How is a decent democracy possible in the absence of reliable information ? https://t.co/WaJ2ywrOJo
A different coalition, including the Lib Dems, and the Greens  Remember. the Lib Dems kept the Tories relatively honest when they were in coalition with them. It was after the Tories formed a coalition with the Neanderthals that we saw their true colours  A truly dreadful gang... https://t.co/ctu3wZOJ0N
So May has delivered both her parts of the deal.
I believe that the only people who enjoy free speech are the newspapers owners  Take Leveson. The NUJ is basically in favour, yet NOT A SINGLE JOURNALIST will speak up for it in public  Unprecedented unanimity ? Or FEAR ? https://t.co/kxjlBrmwa6
With a lot of help from a tiny band of DUP Neanderthals. for whose benefit May is now running Britain, as it is the only way she can cling onto power  No, just kidding... https://t.co/8zvpDf0mdX

Spot on !! https://t.co/XntfUNta1S
It's a shame they have so much money  And, as Napoleon said " What's surprising is not that every man has his price, but how low it is "  So, in the PPI commercials, we were not allowed to say that conning the public to sell PPIs was illegal. We has to say they 'mis-sold' them ! https://t.co/ehqNIzfQ8G
It isn't  But I think there are a lot of decent people in the UK who have no idea how corrupt we have become, so I like to point them to relevant articles https://t.co/5kUYCukBoA
I wonder if Nelson Fraser could get round to explaining why his bosses, the famously reclusive Barclay twins, bombard with writs anyone who mentions their name in print, while their tame Editor demands ' Free Speech '
Any chance of a Sequitur ? https://t.co/nKPnizrgCb
And now we learn that Quentin Pigletts, Dacre's right-hand hatchet man, is a devout Anglican.  As Will Rogers said " I don't make the jokes, I just point them out "
Read in OpenDemocracy James Cusick's piece on corruption at the Evening Standard  Obviously, Osborne is lying. The Ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, of course, a Tory...  And a Parliamentary commitee finds the City of London is the centre of Russian dirty money laundering...
I can understand why you were named 'Meandering' https://t.co/spxmskCDy7
I don't think it's very weak for a journalist to be frightened of never being able to work as a journalist again https://t.co/IAyfgTxBEZ
I find it hard to believe the story about the Evening Standard selling favourable coverage  What a shame the Starbucks executive did not want to be named  It shows the FEAR that people like Osborne and Dacre and Murdoch and Brooks can inspire in decent people
I believe that is what the Beatitudes are teaching  Hard to reconcile that with the Old Testament God, who, presumably, should be setting a better example https://t.co/B9Z0GtO9my

Ironic that the Northern Irish used to dread being incorporated into the Catholic Republic https://t.co/DKq3MfCKRU
Sad that the Northern Ireland women do not have the same abortion rights as the rest of the British Isles  But it's the price paid for May's coalition with Trump-like Neanderthals
Interesting to hear that our MPs have acclaimed the City of London bankers as the top Russian dirty money launderers in the world  That should be worth a few contributions to Tory party funds !
Thank you, Hamburgers, for a quite wonderful reception - even after I pointed out that I'd done the whole performance without mentioning the war
A message for my Belgian fans:  https://t.co/NChDFXPJD7  There's still tickets available for Hasselt on the 30th May, and Ostend on the 31st May.  This is the last chance to see me before I die??  To book click here: https://t.co/nvu9dG37hc  #Belgium #Ostend #Hasselt #LiveComedy

@Byline_Media explains that Murdoch's number 2, Les Hinton, has known about the phone hacking all along.  Don't tell Theresa May, or she'll have to do a deal with the police, as well as Fleet Street. Mustn't let Rupert get cross !
For yet more news about the criminality at Murdoch's papers, go to @Byline_Media   However, do not read it if you are a Tory MP.  It will cause too much cognitive dissonance. Better that you hunker down and obey orders
Our mustard is terrific https://t.co/tkBcbtiwwp
I see tiny Quentin Piglets is defending 'high quality journalism' in his Daily Mail column...  As Will Rogers once said " I don't make the jokes, I just point them out '
So wake up you fat, lazy, stupid Belgian bastards !! If you don't get off your enormous arses and buy some tickets, I will never eat your chocolate again
Tour updates. We are now 40% of our way though the tour. After tonight we will have entertained more that 1% of the population of Iceland ! Tickets are still available for the second show in Vienna and in Zagreb. And in two other cities, both in Belgium : Ostend and Hasselt...

I don't understand.  The papers who are censoring every story that is critical of them are mainly of the right, aren't they ? https://t.co/IBq6A3cVQv
No. I'm making the point that the only well-known writers against Leveson work as journalists  Our best playrights and novelists and philosophers tend to be more articulate, informed and intelligent than most professionals https://t.co/XIrPGq9Fba
The only standards this Prime Minster cares about are ones that will bring her right-wing support at the next election.   So she sends that nonentity Hancock out to lie for her, both in Parliament and to Parliamentary Committees https://t.co/QYfGOIUGmE

Not to anyone who is trying to keep Brooks, and Kavanagh, and Witherow out of jail https://t.co/3WYUzQOzl9
I think you'll find it's you that just lost credibility https://t.co/PTR9RxRw08
Sorry, Fraser Nelson
Nelson Fraser...  Any chance of an answer ?
So...the Labour Party, the SNP, the Green Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and the House of Lords, the NUJ, and every major playwright and novelist are in favour of Leveson 2. And then the Press says all of these are therefore against Press Freedom. How likely is this ?
Even if it puts you out of newspaper work for the rest of your life ?  Journalists live in fear of their Editors. This is not how a Democracy is supposed to work https://t.co/9LoBp4s3Gi

I just wish one of them was a newspaper. https://t.co/Crkb3gpIMr
A journalist who has a story about Rebekah Brook's illegalities has been told that if the story sees the light of day, he will never work in the British Press again Just another aspect of the 'Freedom of the Press to do what the fuck it likes, no matter how illegal it may be'
Thank you. https://t.co/eXvw0ERP0f
Forget the soap stars. That's how our Press sends up a smokescreen  Ask : What about Cameron's Press victims ? And all the others who cannot afford to sue  Next, no Press could be 100% free, as there has to be an Official Secrets Act. The only question is how restrictive it is. https://t.co/gozWik1Xcs
You mean, you'd be quite happy if the tories used that as an excuse for not keeping any of them ? Or merely...some of them ? https://t.co/oJByl3Aoqy
It all depends what you mean by 'Free Press' In the UK, it pretty much means 'Free to do anything they like'  For example, if the whole press conspires to kill a story  critical of them, is this an example of 'Free Press' behaviour ? Does 'Free Press' mean free of ethics ? https://t.co/Swkn2fGkX1
Hallo Bergen  It's lovely to be here during your three-day summer https://t.co/6ayON8dSOo
To be equally fair, the vast proportion of Hacked Off supporters were not  Anyway...how does your 'point' affect any of the moral principles involved ?  For example, how about the press abuse victims, to whom PM Cameron made his promise ? How are they affected by your 'point' ? https://t.co/mJT9hqE75o

Murdoch editor Neil Wallis was acquitted of phone hacking. New evidence in court shows he was heavily involved and that he committed perjury at the Old Bailey, as well as ordering destruction of evidence. Story on @Byline_Media   No wonder Murdoch and May wanted Leveson 2 killed
Thank you Kristiansand for some sensational Halibut and a terrific audience tonight. First time I've ever performed in a Handball arena. Last night in Helsinki, it was an Aeroplane Hanger. What's Bergen going to provide ?

Useful summary  Thanks https://t.co/8Er3b7LlvG
Excellent. An example...  The Barclay brothers will inundate with writs anyone who attempts to write about them. Yet they own the Telegraph and the Spectator, who both constantly demand Freedom of Speech. The hypocrisy is astounding.   Fraser Nelson, do you care to comment ? https://t.co/MIF05rQcHu
He could help us all, if the press were not making sure his story doesn't get out  And they say there's no need for Leveson 2... https://t.co/sqwTVG2EFR
And the jury believed it. She and Coulson never discussed it during their prolonged affair ! I wonder what that cost Murdoch https://t.co/4gUw2wuPz5
This is Mafia behaviour. Not a single journalist will speak out in favour of Leveson 2, because they know they won't work again. And this, despite the fact that the National Union of Journalists is IN FAVOUR of Leveson 2 This is the country the Tories have created https://t.co/VCdIbMkswh
Yes, this is where I got the story from  I love @Byline_Media  More truth there than in all of the printed press put together https://t.co/oLZslJ1YdV
Thank you Trondheim for the lovely reception last night  Tonight...Kristiaansand...if we can find it
Could my twits keep an eye out for any press stories about Rebekah B being caught making payments to crooks for illegal activities ?  One of the freedoms the press treasure is the freedom to kill stories like this

Go to @Byline_Media for new evidence revealed in court of Rebekah Brookes paying blaggers for illegal activities  Murdoch is a big fan of hers
Thank you for sharing your confusion https://t.co/YLQvTbZYFh
There are many answers to your point.  One is : What about the vast majority of people who cannot afford the courts.               Leveson offers low-cost arbitration  Do you have anything against low-cost arbitration ? https://t.co/EDSffULd1P
It's also embarrassing that it rates last in Europe in Trust by its Readers  Don't confuse the two. They have separate solutions https://t.co/WA3djA1Saz
I think it is  May bought the DUP votes by granting them a special favour. That's clear  Obviously the DUP don't give a tinker's cuss about the rest of the UK.But May's government would fall if the DUP stopped supporting them so they have a great deal of unearned leverage https://t.co/rUF6qoT0ha
The British press managed to hush this up in the weeks preceding the Leveson vote  So I ask Witheroe this : Did covering up this evidence of criminal activity affect the Leveson vote in the way the Press intended
He couldn't come up with anyone  I liked him, but it showed that he has no defence to this line of questioning  I'd like to ask a question of John Witherow, the Editor of Murdoch's Times. When Witherow was, for 15 years, Editor of the Sunday Times, he encouraged criminal activity
I then told him that I think that the people who should be red-faced are the ones who agree to work for that monster Rupert Murdoch. I asked him how he felt about Murdoch. He laughed and opined that he didn't think Murdoch was the worst' I asked him to name someone worse........
I sked him whether it was because the Sun thought I was bluffing about leaving the UK. He seemed to think I was, so I explained that I will be leaving - at least May's government is voted out - in November, after I've finished shooting the second series of 'Hold the Sunset'......
Just had a very pleasant encounter with a Sun journalist who held up a very finet Norwegian Blue and asked me if I was feeling 'blue'. I told him that,yes, I was very disappointed by the Leveson vote. Then I asked him why the Sun described me as ' red-faced' He seemed unsure.....

I hear Piers Morgan will pay for a taxi to take me to the airport. He's just in a good mood because May has killed Leveson 2, so he won't be going to jail in the near future But I'll provide a taxi to Brixton when the time comes...
How much ? https://t.co/yrCwkM3zD5
Delighted to hear that Terry G's 'stroke' is extremely minor, and that the Mail was making a meal of it as usual. Anything to make people anxious... I reminded him that he predicted years ago that the Pythons would die in alphabetical order, so he has to hang around a bit

So nine DUP Neanderthals sold the nation down the river, so that May could keep intact her deals with Murdoch and Dacre So much for the explicit promises made to press victims by Tory PM Cameron Bye !
Just watch... https://t.co/bDgEp384ob
All this last-minute stuff about local papers being threatened by Leveson 2 is a smoke-screen, thrown up on the orders of the London-based owners It's all part of the completely unscrupulous lying by London newspapers. If in doubt, read Professor Cathcart's piece on @Byline_Media
Only one problem : our cats like it here  So please,please...email you MP NOW ! The vote is on a knife-edge...  It's surprisingly easy to do.Go to : @hackinginquiry
Huge vote in the Commons tomorrow !  If our corrupt PM wins, meaning that people will still live in fear of the Daily Mail, and she will continue to take her orders from Murdoch...I'm out of here  I refuse to live in an England like this
Wake up, you lazy, fat, cloth-eared Belgian bastards !!!!

Will Rebekah B go to jail ? On the flimsy grounds that she committed crimes ? I don't think Murdoch would allow that https://t.co/t9psUffZfg
If you understand Leveson, you will know that it's not about STOPPING the press from running stories. It's about getting them to CORRECT their stories, if they get something important wrong. And getting this via inexpensive arbitration for people who can't afford to go to court https://t.co/LghZrzRIDp
So...shall we try to do something about it ? https://t.co/YcLpPtTtKP
..if the attempt to kill Leveson 2 fails in a House of Commons vote - against the Government's wishes. If so, Murdoch and Dacre won't take such heavy revenge on her, provided she sticks to the other deals she's done with them, at the WSJ offices and the dinner with Dacre at no 10
I've just heard that Doormatt Hancock is very anxious about Wednesday's vote. Hardly surprising, after the lies he told about Leveson to a Parliamentary Committee. - something that a proper Press would have reported But May feels that the press would not hold her so responsible..
Actually, condemning it draws attention to it. Instead they simply censor it - like the story about Witherow's criminal complicity while he was editing the Sunday Times. https://t.co/ANqFezMf2t

I endorse this opinion 100%  Our current newspapers defend their 'Freedom' to run any kind of story that is in their proprietors' interest, and to censor anything that doesn't  They don't like restrictions on this 'Freedom'. So they reject any responsibility to correct their lies https://t.co/6YZ9wk4Kxa

Michael Cohen has decided to plead the Fifth Amendment.  He did this on the advice of his lawyer, whom he's hired because he's not much of a lawyer himself.  Smart advice. If he lies, he goes to jail for perjury. If he tells the truth he goes to jail for almost everything else

To make things quite clear, the present Editor of the London Times, John Witherow, employed a private investigator to carry out criminal activities for 15 years at the behest of the Sunday Times, during which time Witherow was its editor   The UK press are hushing this up
The main purpose of Leveson 2 is to provide low-cost arbitration for anyone who believes that they have had damaging lies printed about them, and want them corrected  The UK press refers to this as' state control'   The majority of UK people support Leveson 2, as does the NUJ
If anyone is puzzled by attacks on Max Mosley by the racist Daily Mail, which in the 30s supported Hitler, it's because a Mosley family trust provides major funding for Impress, the press regulator which is the only alternative to IPSO,the one run and paid for by the press itself
This is the kind of freedom that the UK press is very keen to retain - the freedom to censor anything remotely critical of the press itself, or of its billionaire absentee owners. Hence their fervent opposition to the implementation of Leveson 2, as promised by David Cameron
Few people have heard that a John Ford has come forward and admitted that for 15 years he carried out criminal acts on behalf of the Sunday Times. Its editor then, John Witherow, now edits the Times. Only the FT and the Guardian ran the story. The rest of our 'Free Press' didn't

The extraordinary revelations of John Ford, who for fifteen years carried out criminal activities at the behest of Murdoch's Sunday Times , is being hushed up by most of the Press  It was been covered only by the BBC and the Guardian  The FT are thinking about printing the story
Indeed, could this explain why the latest Lord Rothermere keeps Paul Dacre on as editor of the DM ?
Perhaps this omission on the ST's part, is simply down to the principle of 'honour among newspaper proprietors'  But if the evil Oswald Mosley had such an effect on his son, could the Lord Rothermere who championed Hitler have had a similar effect on the current Rothermere......
Given this savagery by the ST Murdoch enforcers, I no longer feel constrained to keep secret some tales about the ST top brass, which I have been sitting on for a long time...  Stories which would have been printed had they concerned any other industry than the Press
I understand the Sunday Times's fury about Max Mosley's 1950s pamphlet. I find it harder to accept their reticence about bringing up The Daily Mail's headlines supporting Adolf Hitler, just 20 years before  Aren't headlines in a mass market paper more important than pamphlets ?

Returning from dinner, I was surprised to find that the BBC News Website contained no mention of the story of the crooked investigator who, for over a decade, provided the Sunday Times with information he obtained criminally  Actually...  ...No. I wasn't surprised.
Just read a wonderfully inane piece by Will Gore...  ...saying the reason why so many people believe Leveson 2 should not be killed off is that...wait for it... Some MPs want revenge for having their phony expenses revealed...  Hacks will say anything to preserve their power
Thank God for Byline, Hacked Off, Open Democracy,and Zelo Street......  ......for their daily revelations of the corruption in the London Press
I see Tom Watson criticises Doormatt's 'selective use of facts' That's because MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of lying  Others can  Hancock is an out-and-out LIAR  It was his willingness to lie that got him the job. He hd no other qualifications

Hooray for Byline !!  Question : How does someone as badly informed, third rate and mendacious as Doormatt Hancock finish up in May's cabinet ?  Answer: He does as he's told.

NOBODY has read about these polls because ALL the papers censor stuff like this  Even the BBC. Panorama has had documentary evidence of criminality at the Mail, which it's been sitting on for more than two years  That's the level of corruption we have in the UK now...... https://t.co/9yQqPTgHel
Fine work, Doormatt. You'll go far in the current Tory party  Even further that the last-but-one Minister of Culture, the philistine oaf Whippingdale, another doormat whose taste for dominatrix relationships clearly extends as far as Theresa May  Tory party whips, take notice !
...of the degree of trust that British people have in their printed press, the UK comes LAST in Europe - 33rd out of 33 other European countries  So this improvement has earned our lousy press the right not to have their corruption and criminality exposed in the public interest
I see that Doormatt Hancock has decided to kill off Leveson 2 because ' the world of British newspapers has changed so much since Leveson 1'  In fact, they've improved so much that in the annual polls taken by The European Broadcasting Union, during the past three years...
As promised, here’s the link to The Guardian’s betrayal: https://t.co/DSforS91Ff

Matt Hancock has been catapulted into May's Cabinet, not just as a token Facebook user, but as someone who can be relied upon to carry out the PM's orders, even ( or especially ) when they run quite contrary to the public interest  Hence his nickname : Doormatt Hancock
Matt Hancock says investigating the corrupt behaviour between police, newspapers and politicians, has to stop as it will cost too much money  This is not a joke  Could anyone but a Tory say such a ludicrous thing ?

Of course, the real reason the Daily Mail has been trawling the 1960s for dirt on Mosley is that he supports the implementation of Leveson 2, along with the majority of the UK population and the National Union of Journalists. The DM truly is dishonesty personified. What scum..
I see the Daily Mail is railing about Mosley's 'racist pamphlet' from the 60s  They've forgotten that 30 years earlier the Daily Mail was supporting Adolf Hitler himself  I deplore racist pamphlets,but I detest racist NEWSPAPERS more, especially ones appearing daily in our era

...because she's helping Rupert to get the remaining 61% of Sky, in return for his papers' support at the next general election. So her catspaw Hancock is pretending there's no moral problem with  the Murdochs' management style, just as evidence of their 'criminality' is exposed
Meanwhile, 47 other claimants are suing the Sun too, alleging 'criminality' at the top of the Sun management, including James Murdoch and Rebekah Brookes And some of the 47 will NOT accept hush-money. So the Sun's 'criminality' will finally be proved. Very embarrassing for May...
Interesting situation brewing  The Murdochs have paid hush-money to 24 people who sued the Sun for criminal practices, like hacking and blagging. But they made no admission of liability  The judge has now told them they must come clean about what they deny and what they admit...

I see that Trevor Kavanagh, Rebekah's right-hand rat at the Sun, is squeaking about ' muzzling the Press '   Muzzle is an interesting word. It's something you attack to a dangerous rabid dog to stop it savaging people.
I understand !  It went on a bit because @crackedactor said he'd read the legislation about Leveson. As it's not law ( yet ) I was wondering what legislation he was talking about, but when I asked questions he avoided them https://t.co/oUc6NCbsdL
Since you avoided answering my questions, yes https://t.co/0v4Z5aBp6P

That's what Leveson 2 is trying to change https://t.co/wSvCBXAgDw
For profit ? https://t.co/RaAWNNZ7IE
Yes.  If Leveson allows everyone the chance to have lies corrected at very small cost, what do you have against it ? It would produce better journalism  Or do you see this as ' state control ' ?  Re your last sentence : I guess you might have to find something else to read https://t.co/Kfi5h4OzqC

Thank you. But everyone knows that ' course ' ends with an ' e ' https://t.co/lLPrD1JNmx
The purpose of Leveson 2 it to make it possible for people to complain to papers when they believe they have been lied about ; because Leveson would introduce very LOW COST ARBITRATION for them  Papers would pay losing litigants costs ONLY IF THEY REFUSE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATION https://t.co/NmqXRW1Ujz

If the quote and the main sentence are BOTH questions, two question marks should be used, one at the end of the quote and the other at the end of the sentence enclosing it. Under your rule, a questionmark would end the enclosing sentence, despite the fact it's not a question
I don't think you're right. The point of punctuation is to make meaning clearer. If the quote is a question, the question mark should come at the end of the quote If the sentence which includes the quote is a question, the the question mark should come at the end of the sentence. https://t.co/lZ4f8ujc7R

Editorial control also implies a duty to act ethically.They don't.  Are you happy that people who are lied about can't get proper corrections?

Some of you dear Twits are taking my Drugs joke a little too seriously...  Comics are not required to produce urine samples after they've performed
Incidentally,don't be surprised that you didn't read about the EBU poll in the newspapers !  Meanwhile,they are bleating about the end of 300 years of Press Freedom. By that, they mean the Freedom to CENSOR and PRINT whatever they fucking well like  Which leaves us 33rd out of 33
Please remember that the European Broadcasting Union's recent poll of 33 European countries put the UK LAST ( 33rd! ) on the question of which country trusted their printed media. After Turkey and Montenegro. For the THIRD year in a row !  Wth Article 40, we might improve a bit
This frightens people from trying to get a proper correction of any lies  Low cost arbitration would result in the papers having to take more care with their stories, which is the LAST THING the British Press wants.   But accurate and honest reporting is what the public wants
The British Press has been telling the usual lies about Article 40  Article 40's main purpose is to allow people who've been lied about in the Press to seek corrections and compensation via low-cost arbitration. The papers prefer to force complainants into costly legal actions
Reading about Cycling reminds me that the Pythons were once smeared by allegations that we created our show under the influence of drugs  Easily refuted ! We NEVER failed a test  Nor should we be held responsible for certain of our American 'fans'  Our legacy remains untarnished

I would say that the American Constitution can be regarded a series of rules  The ket to Trump's psychology is that he completely disregards all rules. He believes ( and behaves ) as though they simply don't apply to him  I recommend philosopher Aaron James's  book, ' Assholes ' https://t.co/8ZCleKJreq

So, when they criticise others, presumably their comments are valid because they arise from a 'positive bias ?  Please..........

Obviously Middlesex feel it was very unfair that they didn't win the toss. I suspect there would be no complaining if they'd won it.
I see Middlesex are squealing about the pitch at Taunton. Bit rich, after they created last years's fiasco against Yorkshire at Lord's...

...the British Press had no compunction about censoring this bombshell. Neither did the BBC  Can you believe this corruption exists here ?
Remember, when the European Broadcasting Union's poll recently showed that of 33 countries in Europe, Britain had the least-trusted Press...
Following the Observer's astounding whitewash of the British Press, I wonder...is there not a SINGLE whistleblower prepared to speak out ??

Remember, in a poll of 33 European countries, which measured the degree to which each trusted their printed media, the UK came..........33rd
When I met my wife,her parents used to read the Mail.When they saw stories about us they knew to be completely untrue,they stopped taking it
I'm proud to have survived four hatchet jobs in the Mail in the last 6 months, so it's a thrill to see Paul Dacre now doing one on himself
The average Trump supporter seems like someone who goes regularly to watch professional wrestling, without having any idea that it's fixed

Seems a pity that the BBC is still not interested in reporting on the documentary evidence of the Mail Group's illegal activities  Scared ?

Usual scare tactics in the Mail today. Bit rich of them though, to use fear when the editor, Paul Dacre, is the most feared man in England
Trump chose Schwartz as a collaborator.So he had a good opinion of him.  And intelligent people don't boast they're smart. Unless they're 5

If noone has seen this piece of news in a UK newspaper, it is a perfect example of Censorship of the Press,by the UK Press,for the UK Press
Excellent point ! https://t.co/4Wyqig1R8K
BTW...which UK papers ran stories about the poll showing that  people in the UK trust their press less than in 32 other countries in Europe?
...or...was he just about to say that the Tories plans didn't add up, when he suddenly decided to spend more time at an undisclosed location
What on earth happened to Philip Hammond ? Who replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer ? And WHY ?? Was May jealous of his hair-do !! Or
...so,today, one week away from the General Election...it's gone back to running stories about CANCER !! When everyone really wants to know
And the good news about the UK press is this : a tipping point has been reached. Enough people have had enough. And the Mail is panicking...
I tweeted yesterday that of 33 European countries, we in the UK trust our printed media least !  I expect the UK press to censor this

Working for Murdoch,you become so inured to lying,censorship by editors, and sexual harassment,that you view any flicker of decency as piety
I hear a trainee gossip at the Times describes me as being increasing pious in my old age. My friends were incredulous.The explanation ?...

So David has frightened off Goliath...  But he's not slain yet,so Byline are going to keep chasing him around till he has a heart attack
Good news. The Daily Mail,who were suing Byline for libel,have just backed down,as their lawyers realised they didn't have a leg to stand on
Could someone tell Amber Rudd that this is the same Murdoch as the one who has to be a 'fit and proper' person to buy all the rest of Sky

People for Trump to blame when he loses the plot: Gwyneth Paltrow; The Taco Bell Chihuahua; Tony Bennett; Rasputin; Amelia Earhart; Harpists

...that the number was 45 million. This new info was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The UK Press won't write about this. Why
The FCA, the body which regulates financial services now says that up to 64 million PPI were sold to 30 million people. In 2014 they said...

With friends like you,who needs assholes ? https://t.co/lS1oolfDmw
If you chose to put yourself in the public arena,I think you should  And of course,Trump should. Why would he not ? Ah ! https://t.co/8KZSEdoISQ
BTW, better to avoid 'Harmsworth', when you consider the harm he's done to his country,and what that must have been worth to him financially
And I pay my tax in the UK,after deducting the withholding taxes I have paid in other countries where I work.
I hope that's true. But then,why does he continue with a man who has brought to the Mail the derision and contempt of most educated people https://t.co/cx4W6AkgTn
This is the world we live in  As you may have noticed,there is no hope... https://t.co/PvkWglhVCK
I stand corrected. Rathermore is not officially French as I had read. He's British but he chooses to live with the Frogs for tax reasons
If I'm a nondom,what part of London am I living in ? You've got me worried... https://t.co/8j1hMcfYS5

Stan,I've got a hip replacement operation ( a Hip-op ) in a few days so I won't be very mobile. Even if I'm still alive...  Where's the 'do' https://t.co/aIofPRkqZd
Is this the amount of tax ViscOunt Rathermore has saved by not paying tax in the UK ? https://t.co/GdmJAmwUa3
Because newspapers contribute to a democracy when they try to report reality,and they undermine it when they try to create their own reality https://t.co/T4iO68EchY
I'm so sorry !!!  I left an 'o' out of Viscount Rothermere. My unconscious apologises profusely
Yes,the owner of the deeply patriotic Mail chose French nationality so that he wouldn't have to pay tax in the UK. Viscunt Rothermere...
I gave my TomTom voice to my daughter Camilla but she said it was dangerous because she's so used to doing the opposite of what I tell her https://t.co/3YzmAO7iir
I don't believe that Freudian hypothesis https://t.co/7heEt7HL8V
Trying to get Dacre fired for being pro-Brexit is like trying to get Stalin fired for not renewing his dog licence. What a sap Rothermere is
Read 'Assholes' by Aaron James. It's all in there.... https://t.co/BJ8EEewzOv
Yes,I think that's why people are trying to escape  But not to Chicago,according to Trump https://t.co/5Gr79qmYxP
I've had my Cryptography Department working on this,but they can make no sense of it  Would you care for another go at expressing your idea? https://t.co/avJGlYygNK

No,he's not going to give up his day job https://t.co/fIrWzWlbOF
Not necessary ! As Will Rogers once said ' I don't make the jokes,I just point them out ' https://t.co/PmON9lXS5C

Thank you, Dmarie  !! https://t.co/E46ueWttHB
The Orange One says he's at war with the media. What worries me is that he may be at war with reality. That's one he's not going to win...
You should hear what she calls me...  She is a sabre-toothed daughter. But funny,unfortunately https://t.co/2Ole6BmDEj

My daughter Camilla celebrated her 51st Birthday yesterday !  See her stand-up on YouTube - Camilla Cleese
Lovely audience of 2,400 in Pittsburgh tonight.  Off to Newark tomorrow,then Bethesda,Wilkes-Barre and Red Bank.Then hip replacement in LA !
Can you give me the date of this strange event ?  Does it happen once a year or more often ? https://t.co/IYT2Wvllwm
I'm sorry, but what made America get ? What is it that the few million of you believe in, that you've got ? Something to do with education ? https://t.co/oSBPa3Mb8D

Tomorrow night,a mere 700 in Green Bay - a football town rather than a Python town, apparently And tonight they lost to the Atlanta Falcons.

The main point,surely, is that the 'debate' was of an appallingy low quality on both sides,mainly due to our dreadful,prejudiced newspapers. https://t.co/3JVvuIn1wi
Well Matthias,that's your opinion and I respect it. I still disagree.  But I am sure we won't know who is right for at least five years https://t.co/qGVRj2Hzxe
In my original tweet I carefully said that if I thought there was any chance of the EU reforming itself,I would vote to remain. https://t.co/WckzFI0c5d
