@Twittterknitter @DualitLtd @gransnet Not cool @DualitLtd
@DavidLammy His lies to the British people should be held accountable in court. It’s completely unacceptable how he still has a job.
@marobbo76 Yes. Yes it is.
@CHIMPSINSOCKS Arrest that awful human being.
@RealRoyKnight @RickyKnightWAW I cannot effin wait! See you there!
listening to Doggystyle in 1993 as a kid I never imagined @SnoopDogg would be watching me in a screening of #FightingWithMyFamily in his own private cinema. Weird how things turn out. https://t.co/o45Q35iws1
I was going to drop that season 3 returns 3/24 but it seems news has been released that season 3 will be #IntoTheBadlands last.  I’m really sad at this decision. An incredible group of people made our show both infront and behind the camera and I’m sad that’s that. Bajie out.
Oh well... here goes...
@danlesac @AdamRichman Maybe I have.
@AdamRichman For me the fruit shortcake is an excellent dunker and then you get the little raisins in there as a fun after shock. Shortbread, in my family was a specialty biscuit only really unveiled after funerals. Hence for me a bleak connotation.
@AdamRichman Out of all those though, if I HAD to chose... fruit shortcake.
@AdamRichman One of each!!!!
Hey sports commentators... stop telling players what they should’ve done differently to score... they didn’t. So you’re “if only he’d taken a touch first and then leant back a bit and sent it into the far corner’ bullshit is UTTERLY POINTLESS!!!
I’ll be dropping some #IntoTheBadlands knowledge later. Stay tuned!!!
@DavidLammy I’d love to see this guy live-circumcised on Sky Box Office! No anaesthetic.
@DavidLammy Fucking remoaners!!! What do they know! Puffin meat for all.
@davidfarrier I’ve almost died 3 times in my life.
@Jacob_Rees_Mogg Stop lying. You liar.
Pretending to be happy on social media or painting a picture of happiness is not the same as actually being happy. You can live without social media, happily. But you can’t live without happiness. Even if that happiness is tiny and fleeting.

@DroogJanus I get Jupiter is many times bigger than the earth though...
@DroogJanus That’s what I was thinking about! Thank you. What’s the distance between Jupiter and io?
@DroogJanus @Amanda_Kerri Yes it is!
If the moon helps to create tidal movement here on earth due to its gravitational force,  is there a similar effect on the moon from earth? I get there’s no water for tidal flow but is there any effect?
@davidfarrier I always have a problem with the phrase ‘mile high club.’  That’s only about 5000ft. You’d be just beginning your initial climb. You’d NEVER be allowed out of your seat to fuck a person in the toilet.
@ClaretandH 😂😂😂
Why is everyone always so surprised by winter. It happens every year. Stop reporting on it like it’s a complete surprise and totally unexpected. In a few months it’ll be summer and you’ll then be surprised by the amount of heat we’re getting.

I’m horny for terrariums.
One People. Many Cultures.
Sinkhole thing on C5... The script is absolutely awful. The Sinkhole isn’t a living, breathing thing. It isn’t specifically targeting people. Stop using the phrase ‘Attack.’ Ridiculous.
@thegregfleet @edgarwright I speak all langauge
@theopenmatt And it’s a cube instead of a circle.
@danielwuyanzu You melt my popsicle.

@frankieboyle That’s the best we can hope for.
@flidby I couldn’t finish it.
I tried to make an omelette last night but I cracked an egg and essentially a black embryo fell out. It stank like a rotten corpse. Some of the liquid went on me.

Watching the news warn us that trees could be more brittle because of heatwave and wind could make them break. Fuck me, why do we have to be scared of EVERYTHING.
Ooh it’s so hot, kill me, it’s too hot, when will it end? Now too much rain and lightning, hail, global warming?!! Warning issued...  SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!

Sicknote Season 2 starts tonight @SkyOne 10pm!!!
I have NO IDEA why Carrie and Doug from King of Queens stay together. It’s so disfunctional. It’s awful to watch. Poor them. They just don’t make each other happy anymore.
@realDonaldTrump You’re really bad at this.
I know it sounds counter intuitive but if you can leave a Callipo for a minute or two it often yields something quite special.
@timbensonart It’s amazing!
@LukeyWoodsey I want you to care about everything.
Remember to put a saucer of ice out at night so the Spiders can come out and bathe in the water as it melts. This weather is particularly harsh on arachnids. A lot of them have lost ALL THE FUR from their swollen abdomens in an attempt to keep cool.
It’s true... https://t.co/NJExmuShpV
Me as I leave shops at the moment... “stay cool guys.”
We’ve had a cat flap put in the fridge so Colonel Otto Von Dickead can keep cool.
