listening to Doggystyle in 1993 as a kid I never imagined @SnoopDogg would be watching me in a screening of #FightingWithMyFamily in his own private cinema. Weird how things turn out. https://t.co/o45Q35iws1
I was going to drop that season 3 returns 3/24 but it seems news has been released that season 3 will be #IntoTheBadlands last.  I‚Äôm really sad at this decision. An incredible group of people made our show both infront and behind the camera and I‚Äôm sad that‚Äôs that. Bajie out.
Oh well... here goes...
@danlesac @AdamRichman Maybe I have.
@AdamRichman For me the fruit shortcake is an excellent dunker and then you get the little raisins in there as a fun after shock. Shortbread, in my family was a specialty biscuit only really unveiled after funerals. Hence for me a bleak connotation.
@AdamRichman Out of all those though, if I HAD to chose... fruit shortcake.
@AdamRichman One of each!!!!
Hey sports commentators... stop telling players what they should‚Äôve done differently to score... they didn‚Äôt. So you‚Äôre ‚Äúif only he‚Äôd taken a touch first and then leant back a bit and sent it into the far corner‚Äô bullshit is UTTERLY POINTLESS!!!
I‚Äôll be dropping some #IntoTheBadlands knowledge later. Stay tuned!!!

Pretending to be happy on social media or painting a picture of happiness is not the same as actually being happy. You can live without social media, happily. But you can‚Äôt live without happiness. Even if that happiness is tiny and fleeting.
