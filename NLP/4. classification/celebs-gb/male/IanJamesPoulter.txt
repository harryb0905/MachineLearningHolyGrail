Sally if he feels he left shots on the course and could have played better I think it’s great that he is disappointed. It’s shows drive and passion to improve. Never be content with just good. Work harder get better results. 👍🏻👊🏻🏆 https://t.co/1IYJ1IRcn0

.@TigerWoods &amp; #philmickelson are possibly the only people that can open the @USGA eye’s. Although they have never listened or learnt in the past.. One day it will happen but I will probably be retired from playing US Open golf. What a shame.  “More stubborn than an old man” https://t.co/tkA2Cm2ux5
I pulled it slightly on 15th and might have dropped the F-Bomb.. Sorry if anyone was offended. Can’t say oh dear that was frightfully unfortunate.. I tried but it doesn’t sound the same or get rid of any frustration. Sorry anyway. I will oppolgise next time as well.
Been working to put the new @Titleist TS3 driver in the bag. The facts of testing are more speed, higher launch and less spin. Which means more carry distance with a good landing angle and still rolling out. Not bad for a 42 year old with spaghetti arms. 😉 https://t.co/yE17hV4O0p

Thanks guys did Bozo set the course up or are the @USGA going to accept responsibility or just say “IF WE HAD A MULLIGAN” I would have liked about 6 mulligans today. But they are not allowed at this level. “Apparently” https://t.co/O08vOpNlTx
Verbally abused on every hole does get a little old.. That’s not really golf either. Ryder Cup in 2024 COULD become a little silly, just like today was. @usopengolf @USGA  Still we never hear the word SORRY.  When I F@&amp;$ up I have to apologize. Not the @USGA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/T2mrna08bq
Is that an apology ? Just grow a set of balls and say we £€¥#ed it up again...  You don’t get mulligan’s in business at this level. how can this team keep doing this without consequences. https://t.co/INvUmT6M6P
I’m not sure i could possibly comment without using words which shouldn’t be seen... just like some of those pins. “Disappointing” @USGA @usopengolf why are mistake still being made at this level. Was that fun to watch guys ? I’m only 4 behind &amp; can still win this 👍🏻👊🏻 https://t.co/sbXm36JmAN

What a @TheMasters. Sad to see Justin miss out, but @TheSergioGarcia to win a Major on #Seve's birthday &amp; finally become the Major champion.
I'm sitting watching @TheMasters with Joshua and he said they are not allowed to putt like that. They have to hold it properly. 🤣🤣🤣
Saturday pin locations are good @TheMasters great weather conditions and some exciting pairings will result in some great scoring. Enjoy. https://t.co/eSXz9mneY5
@TomHartleySnr The next 2 weeks @RBC Hilton Head. And @valerotxopen. No injuries at the minute. Game feels good.
What a shot #FredCouples on 18. And what a putt to save par on 15 from #PhilMickelson
I'm not saying pay to watch someone in the past I was talking present... I would pay to watch #Michelson who would you pay to watch ?
If someone said to me I have to pay money to watch 1 golfer. Without question I would choose #PhilMickelson  Who would you choose.. ?
How good is Fred Couples ? Absolute legend. No one has played Augusta National as well for so long. Love watching him. https://t.co/cvdSDZXi62

I hope he has a smile on his face when we can finally get the goods out of the warehouse. 👍🏻 https://t.co/WHbbBrlnIq

Im so happy the @RandA and the @USGA are addressing the complex very confusing rule book. Common sense will help all enjoy the game of golf.

I disagree with brake failure causing that turn 2 incident. Nico could have turned that steering wheel 5 meters earlier at least. No excuse
Be interesting to hear Toto Wolff, and he is trying to defend Nico not turning into that corner. Say it how it is. He should have turned.
I'm sorry but Nico didn't even turn into that corner. His hand didn't even turn that wheel at all, he tried to drive him off track.
Well done @LewisHamilton he deserved that win. @nico_rosberg drove him way wide and hit into Hamilton on that last lap. Brilliant race.
That's was the worst penalty I have ever seen.....
Hahaha that's what I meant. https://t.co/XKVmGKrJLx

Does anyone know the footie scores from today.....
What an incredible race by @Max33Verstappen in the @redbullracing holding off Kimi and winning on his debut in the Redbull. Congratulations.
Clearly @LewisHamilton had his nose level with @nico_rosberg rear wheel which means he shouldn't have squeezed him. https://t.co/26uRf3WJIT
The block button is the best invention on Twitter. I block so many people who are a waste of Oxygen. It's actually quite cleansing...
It's very hard to explain properly In 140 characters, i will explain by video on my new website which I will relaunch in a few weeks time.
They were as fast as Shinnecock hills 2004 but shinnecock more severe slopes, so I think they were quickest I've ever seen.
There were some great scores so no excuses. But we shouldn't take 5 hours 50 minutes to play golf. It's too long.
Some interesting conversations this evening with players and the tour.... I would expect a statement coming out soon from what I gathered.
That round of Ken Duke is simply brilliant... I tip my hat sir, that is one fantastic effort. Round of the year by far.
Well that was quite tricky..... Shinnecock TPC, feels like I've been hit with a big wet 10lb salmon...
Nice to finish off round 2 with an eagle and a birdie. Round 3 tee off time is 12.44 https://t.co/Z3CnsMxg7p
That's quite a naughty start for @McIlroyRory https://t.co/PCS3SXEoQG
Played nicely today -3, scoring very low today as the greens are very soft and slower than normal. https://t.co/IZokHEzq5m

What track am I racing at ? Just set a 1.53.865 incredible simulator @ProSim_  https://t.co/GOLsOXTBW8
Leicester are a team playing with passion and desire.... They want it.. And that makes a difference. It's now 2-0 great goal. Well deserved
Was you born anywhere near Manchester ? https://t.co/UpA3L9zKhV
Go on Leicester.... Finish it off. You more than deserve to win. Against all odds. Would love to see it.
This simply isn't good enough @Arsenal... We shouldn't be in this position. In danger of finishing 5th. Why ?
Adrian the setup is incredible... Really happy with the simulators. So realistic, Quality is brilliant. I love it. https://t.co/zKdlJz5nnE
Does Giroud ever track back after losing the ball ? If he doesn't get a pass land at his feet he throws his hands up. Get stuck in too lazy
Told you so... Can't believe someone would waste so much time spouting shite that's all made up.  https://t.co/Xbx0ec1Bqk
This shows that STP isn't a pro at all, this is old news. I hosted last year. Donald this year, Rose next then westy https://t.co/yHwL8UE1SK
Tom, it's been so good working with you and the Team. Amazing fun, food &amp; friends. Brain already working on next one https://t.co/2tZkF1n9aR

Anytime, we should have a little race event at the house. I have 2 of them linked together so we can race each other https://t.co/8KosB12c7Q
So I just found out.... Felt somewhat hopeless....  https://t.co/f3zfBJTBiV
These sims are incredible Marino, any car any track. Everything on the sim can be set to your race car.  https://t.co/7APGK2HiZK
Then Adrian from @ProSim_ decided to show us how good this sim really is. @Ferrari 458 challenge car. It's race time https://t.co/ZqZp0V1V3H
The @ProSim_ have been set up &amp; @tomsstory decided to take the @Ferrari for a spin... Literally. So much fun. https://t.co/EzajtiJ9qx

.@Danny_Willett well done that man.... And I new baby that was due today... The name Augusta sounds pretty good.
.@Danny_Willett has that very famous putt....
At home with the family... And my lovely wife Katie has cooked up a Sunday roast. Fantastic 😋 https://t.co/G8bsz0AFy9
Very good @Danny_Willett great tee shot up the last.. I hope he finishes it off. Would be lovely to see it.
OMG.........
Wow @Louis57TM now following @Love3d and @ShaneLowryGolf with an ace on the 16th.. Will there be anymore ?
$20 million maybe $25 https://t.co/9cCBOWDFQp
.@JordanSpieth has 2 tricky holes left. 11 and 12 if he plays them 1 over he is your winner again. The kid can seriously roll the rock.
It's 4 yards downhill. So it is 152 minus the elevation.  https://t.co/qjfHWKNSac
I actually think Quasimodo would look good in a Masters green jacket. https://t.co/h5hxllqMQ0
The 12th is playing 148 yards today. We had a breeze from the left. I hit 9 iron in the water for first time ever. https://t.co/sht4NalS5a
What did I say ? https://t.co/WTYmQdt65y
.@Danny_Willett has left himself the best chance for birdie on 11. His putt is slightly uphill and will break a touch right to left,
Just can't see anyone beating @JordanSpieth, but if they do I can't wait to see the run they will make on this back 9.
Bentley decided to join me watching @TheMasters on the sofa. https://t.co/6wRteymOn3
Now @Love3d following @ShaneLowryGolf with a hole in 1 on the 16th... Will there be anymore today ?
You are very welcome Stephen thanks for entering the competition. I've got a bag load of goodies from masters. Comp https://t.co/euzGJxDNFO
No sir, I'm landing into Orlando in 10 minutes and will be watching the back 9 on my sofa with a nice cold beer.  https://t.co/PNhotrsTVO
Well done @ShaneLowryGolf great buzz to get a hole in one on the 16th.. Enjoy that noise..... It's loud. @TheMasters crystal.
I hope Langer has some energy left in the tank, would be so good to see him pushing the young pups all the way...
Played nicely today.. And nearly popped her in for a little ace on the 16th. Would have been nice. Back to the drawing board. Home James...
There will be lots of birdies today with those pins &amp; the pin on the last is 1 yard further up than norm. Low score https://t.co/QIwhW1KKCJ
It's Sunday of @TheMasters &amp; I'm too far back to contend. Gutted yes, but it's my own fault. It was my ball and I hit it. #MustWorkHarder
What a lovely picture. 2 legends together. https://t.co/qtYGTwigTJ
I'm surprised you even gave it a review.... I'm honored. Im not upset about mentioning 82. Should have been 84.  https://t.co/Ln49c0haV0
So glad I left school at 15 &amp; struggle to understand your verbiage, Just think if I'd stayed on &amp; become a journo.😂 https://t.co/3yTKnnECWz

That's the problem you are entering a conversation and clearly haven't got the full picture Alan.  https://t.co/v0HAuEcA41
Alan as one of your fellow journalists just messaged me.. Alan is a %€=¥.... I have to agree. you seem popular.  https://t.co/XuWOGD7al3
Twitter is fine for opinions.. But what about new papers to put people down. ? That's ok ? https://t.co/ZKuRwz3Fn4
.@AlanShipnuck explain that tweet please. Opine means what ? I left school at 15. Must have missed that in English. https://t.co/4iYS8UuRNa
Alan can you help me understand what you are saying "Let the man Opine" ? Sorry my IQ isn't very large.  https://t.co/4iYS8UuRNa
There will now be lots of players who could possibly make a run at @TheMasters. Light winds, easier pins. Masters Sunday roars. Who will win
Now these are words worth reading..... https://t.co/nmupUG1qaY
I need to keep working harder to improve. I'm going to have to get back into the top 50 again to get the invite back. Can't miss this event.
It must be nice to write shit about the players and keep getting an invite back to @TheMasters to write more shit. https://t.co/qvSD4tdApL
Oh @oliverbrown_tel I am disappointed.. You wasn't brave enough to use your own vocabulary.. You had to borrow Dan's https://t.co/7xlmMLQLUo
Mr Langer is some player at Augusta National. Age means nothing, experience is everything. Incredible.
I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride but not that bumpy... Lost my touch early on the greens &amp; didn't find it again. 82 my highest by 4. 😁
Buckle up folks this is going to be one hell of a ride...... 💨⛳️
No players just Pepsi @Keegan_Bradley caddy. He had his @whufc_official shirt on. Small wager null and void. https://t.co/5IoB9dhtZG
What a good game of football..
This will be a fun last 20 minutes in the caddy shack @TheMasters 3-3 https://t.co/xqc5RMLasC
Easy @whufc_official I even wore Claret and blue yesterday.... Be nice.. 😂😂 this is what happens when we play big strong teams.
It's a great game of football. Sloppy defense and now it's 2-2.
It's a nice morning... Doing my pins watching @Arsenal score 2 goals. Fresh cup of coffee, Poached eggs. Come on lads. Need Goal difference

I guess a big weekend like last year would be very helpful 67,67, who knows it might have a chance. Keep believing. #NeverSayNever
It's slightly disappointing when this muppet @oliverbrown_tel puts people down about there appearance &amp; is scruffiest journalist I've met.
You just can't help yourself Oliver. Sorry my clothing company offends you. Obviously not windy in the press room!!! https://t.co/lymC7zSgoA
This is why we love @TheMasters and Augusta National. It can reward you in one hand a punish in the other. Live to fight another day. 👊
Thanks for the support today guys. Long way to go, but really solid round in those conditions. Work in progress. #keepbelieving
That was a very tricky day on the course. 25mph makes for difficult club selection. Really pleased with the start, played super aggressive.

7 days of hard work to iron the kinks out for @TheMasters. As its the only major I'm in at the moment it's a big one.. Let's kick some arse.
When things are tough you really know who your true friends are..... You could probably count them on one hand... #Fact. Keep improving.
Looks like the Easter bunny has been kind today. I will be home in a couple of hours to help you eat that chocolate https://t.co/Vwpbo7Lmsx
4 bogeys all week, game is very close. I will keep working to try and get my game back in shape. Thanks for the support guys.
Huge thanks to everyone at the @PuertoRicoOpen you've been amazing this week. Sorry I didn't pull it off. Great event. Best wishes Poults
I wish I was playing but I'm watching on TV, &amp; i played this format last year. A player has no adrenalin when he knows he can't advance.
I'm not sure of this Matchplay format. Too many matches being played which don't mean anything. Playing knowing your going home. No sense.
All good mate, hope your all good as well, That @Ford GT looks like a lot of fun.  https://t.co/FiUnqsiJkz

Totally against all of the pressure..... That's an amazing time to to score a goal. Arsenal didn't look like scoring. Bang goal. Get in.
Fast paced game, already a couple of strong tackles. Yellow cards are flying and I'm sure we will see some red. I just hope we see red goals
Spurs are controlling this match so far... From a TV perspective... How's it looking from the ground @piersmorgan @Lord_Sugar ?

No are you....... The form you guys are in, and at home should be an easy win for you. https://t.co/vXE9A8JcrK
12 hours until the big game @Arsenal vs @SpursOfficial it's a must win game. No excuses it's time to show the passion and deliver.
It's Lilly's birthday Today... Aimee didn't realize I was taking this picture. Happy birthday my little girl. https://t.co/4xjMpcQZ8E
I wish I was there but. The Top 3 at @CadillacChamp are 3 of the longest hitters on tour just like last year. Horses for courses.

Much needed 3 points today for @Arsenal at @afcbournemouth.
Well the @DiscoverMono has arrived at pebble beach.... And yes it looks awesome. Needs driving.. https://t.co/MOJIf9kmOx
I didn't think I would say the biggest game for Arsenal this year would be vs Bournemouth tomorrow. Must 3 points or it's not looking good.
The way I'm playing, I couldn't afford to fill it with fuel...... https://t.co/Sf50Pqhr6L
I one handed the putt on the 16th @WMPhoenixOpen because I was 3/3 from inside 24ft on the back 9. Would have loved for it to go in. 💪🏻
Flying to Pebble beach tonight. Leisurely 18 holes at MPCC tomorrow then a stroll around Pebble Beach on Sunday..
Well I guess it will be the first @CadillacChamp I've missed for some time @TrumpDoral. I guess I will be at @LakeNonaGCC working on my game
Just to explain. I holed at 24ft 1 handed out on 9. 12ft on 12. 6ft on 13. I putt nicely 1 handed in practice. Sometimes it works.
I couldn't make a birdie today. But this guy made it look real easy. Check it out. 😂😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/HzXHJkC0rd via youtube

Hahahaha a little touchy at the minute..... Not happy... 😡😡😡😡😡😡 https://t.co/MTm5YVTTUT
I have faith. Why couldn't we have played 77 minutes with 11 men instead of 10. No guarantee Costa would have scored https://t.co/DoXzJbkYwM
Stick to that silly shaped ball tubs..... https://t.co/loTs3MetDi
Me Lord..... It's Bollocks... Not happy. Exposed arsenal team again. Centre half too slow.... End of story. https://t.co/z3VQqDtjUe
I have no problem with the red card. It had to be. last man... But Costa I can't stand. Chelsea will probably win 7 - 0 today.
Now Costa scores.... Well done Chelsea but Costa is a horrible player. The one game we need to win and The bus ruins it after 17 minutes.
Well that's a load of old bollocks. Typical. Caught at the back by the one guy that dives more than anyone else. Costa total mug.
Come on @Arsenal let's be having you.
You had a couple called woods and Mickelson but that didn't mate much difference either did it.. 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 https://t.co/KqmoeVrir3

2 injections in my foot yesterday so resting as feeling a little sore now. 4 rounds of golf left this year. Then looking like 10 weeks off.
Really looking forward to seeing all my friends at @AudemarsPiguet this week in Dubai. Maybe a new timepiece as well https://t.co/ETBHQTAPZq

Ronda needs to work a different tactic and play her at the other game. On the canvas she would win. Can't box Holly. https://t.co/okzirT6gO4
I should come and dive with those amazing fish.. Would be fantastic experience.  https://t.co/TzekLJbOLH
What a fight... @_HOLLYHOLM was clinical in a fight that everyone said she wouldn't win. @RondaRousey rematch please https://t.co/HAIF8IuKYq
This never gets old...... @atlantis could stand looking at this the whole day. Not your normal fish… https://t.co/icB1QglO4E

Just having a nice dinner in Hakkasan Shanghai, before heading to the airport to fly to Dubai. 4 weeks down one to go... Then 10 weeks off.
Sorry folks just can't seem to finish it off. Thru it all away again today. Missed a 3ft putt for birdie on 13 to tie lead &amp; finished poor.
Played lovely again today. Shame missed that tiddler on the last though, Game is good, mind is good. 5 rounds left to end the season.
Sad sad attacks in Paris. Thoughts go out to the families and people who have lost lives.
In 12 years with @ATT I've paid on time &amp; you cut me off when im traveling for 5 weeks in Asia. #Helpful thanks https://t.co/zYR3YRAGBq

Playing a @HSBC_Sport golf day in Shanghai for #HSBC guests. @Titleist ready to go... https://t.co/bwC7cBMjgY
Played lovely golf last week. 61/72 greens in regulation. Just got to keep working hard. It's coming. I know it. BMW Shanghai this week.
The good news is I'm leading GIR. The bad news, my combined birdie footage of putts for the week so is 31ft. What a total €$%#¥$
That's the most frustrating start to a tournament I've had in years. 32/36 greens in reg. 28 putts inside 20ft. 3 birdies, 2 were 3ft. 👀👓⛳️🔫
I played well today. 17 greens in reg. and 16 of those were inside 20ft. The other was 40ft. The hole froze over 🙈 time to open it up.
Sorry I was just trying to concentrate and move up the leaderboard at the weekend. Can't fake smile like some. https://t.co/Ht4oUscGNF
Pleasure. Always try and keep the fans happy.  https://t.co/vaKaonllww
