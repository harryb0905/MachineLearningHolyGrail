Thank you, and without wishing to sound too show-offy I agree. https://t.co/TEkv2Q9wQS
I've been typing for 45 years and yet I make the most typos on this MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) keyboard than on anything else I've ever worked with. The smug 'I work at Apple' 'engineers' who developed this wretched keyboard should be vigorously scorned and belittled
@surfnoosa Wow, amazing footage, thanks for sending the link.
@NigelPlaner1 Excellent picture Nige, love the hair!
Good point, ooof. Awkward. https://t.co/v1lcBN1yKq
@bobblyone @YouTube @MLiebreich I know, @Carpervert is annoyingly good, forcing me to raise my game. I'll never be that talented.
@bobblyone @YouTube @MLiebreich Yeah, Bill is a bit old school on this topic. Oh, and the clip is posted by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, one of the most reactionary, fanatical right wing lobby groups on the planet
@wubbeop @Carpervert Yes, eventually, but it'll probably take 100 years.
@Zapaman @Rjdlandscapes @Carpervert How does that happen. How could I not have seen that before I tweeted. Doh. Yeah, Jonny's had the hots for Rod for ages. HotRod. Doh!
@EVclicks @GoUltraLow @EVEC_MK @FullyChargedDan @TomRaftery @OLEVgovuk @WiebeWkkr @pluginadventure @KateFantom @TheKateArmitage @ecarstrading @cleevelyev @janefagray Here's a few pics for the collection https://t.co/93RFWODlRU
Big, capable, luxurious, comfortable, quiet and possibly just a bit portly, @Carpervert goes off rod in the Audi e-Tron on #FullyChargedShow  https://t.co/Ekw17TcXP9
@RandyVegetables Yes, we are hoping to work with her a lot in the future.
In case you haven't seen this episode of #FullyChargedShow it's really good. I know 'I would say that wouldn't I' but seriously this is an excellent episode. https://t.co/iIiIh1Sx0l
@Dr_Black @sadknob @ucnhchamber Oh My lord!! Two worlds collide!! Such a great pic, looks like you're having enormous fun ma'am and sir.  Much love to you both
@deadphill @Carpervert Podcasts are released every Monday.
@The_PlugSeeker @FullyChargedShw @helenczerski @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan Simple answer. Yes.
Our Patreon supporters are in for a bit of a treat with the next episode of #FullyChargedShow coming this afternoon.  It's truly amazing, I've just watched it. (I'm not in it) and @Carpervert is at the top of his game. It will be available for all tomorrow.
@nigelwickenden @FullyChargedShw @helenczerski @Carpervert There's no arguing with that.
It's quite windy here on the coast of Northern New South Wales. Anyone would think there was a cyclone nearby. Just watched rain drops going up. Most impressive.
@TerryCox60 The only people I know are @jojusolar who have installed my system and they are very efficient, tidy, professional and really know what they're doing
@SteveLondon79 Sound like a very sensible plan, as long as the same homes are super energy efficient and fitted with air source/ground source heating, solar PV and batteries.
Why aren’t renewable energy systems being installed faster when the electricity they produce is cheaper . . .  Oh yeah. This. https://t.co/KsQVSydFMS
We are experiencing the edge of #CycloneOma at the moment, it's quite breezy. Going to watch some largish waves later, and no, I won't be surfing. Waves are good to see, from a distance.
@richardelliot Depending where you are, I would say it's the majority of houses now have solar PV. Even massive shopping malls (I'm about to visit on e) are festooned with solar. Yes, very big change
#FullyChargedShow has a look at the state of battery research and development in this wonderful episode with @helenczerski  https://t.co/iIiIh1Sx0l
@silverSpoon We haven't done one yet but it is a very good idea. Will try.
@cyndiy2 Only who? I'm none of those labels so I have no idea what you mean. Why would you even bother to try and defend a dull reactionary bully like Carlson.
The latest episode of #FullyChargedShow has some of the most positive comments we've ever had. (I'm not in it) Batteries with @helenczerski  https://t.co/iIiIh1Sx0l
@DavidHRobb Agreed, I'm very aware it's the current administration that is coal obsessed, but the opposition are also scared of the coal mining union lobby.  A right old pickle, something we Brits are masters of at the moment.
@AusRob Believe me it's a relief when you consider what we're dealing with on a small damp island off the coast of Europe.
As I sit here smugly sipping my latte, (actually it's a cup of tea but never mind) I am saddened by the fact that this country is so coal obsessed when it doesn't need to burn any. https://t.co/N8TMUc2627
@GavinFree That is amazing. Big congrats.
This is glorious, Fox News as you will never see it. Rutger Bregman is a bit of a dude isn't he. https://t.co/wen5mat7JB
@matty_198881 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw The description of different chargers are confusing. Fast means 7 kw to 22kw, the sort of socket you can have at your home. (all cars can use that) Rapid means 50kw upwards, like on motorways etc
@matty_198881 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Once again I don't know, but contactless, (induction) charging is certainly a contender. I'd suggest the cost in installation is a factor, but I've used it on test cars and it wrks brilliantly
New episode, #FullyChargedShow looks at current and future battery tech with @helenczerski at Warwick Manufacturing Group.  https://t.co/iIiIh1Sx0l
@matty_198881 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Obviously I don't know when, but I hope it's soon and I'm confident it will. I would guess it's going to be CCS for rapid charging in Europe at least. Type 2, as it's known, is already standard in all new cars.
@ecocars1 @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert Sadly not me :-(
@mcsmik @FullyChargedDan Bit of a glitch, otherwise known as Robert made a boo boo. The episode is coming at 2pm today.
@EJ4573 @beyondzeronews Still here. Will DM you.
@robinince Happy birthday sir. Such a sweet picture too.
@DannyDangerOz @NewElectricIRL @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @NewElectric @zeroevuk I'm sure it can be done, however whether it's affordable is another question. If you can afford the conversion, the running costs would be minuscule.
@tripod2000 I would love to, it's about time we did an update. I'll get in touch with the folks I know. Thanks for the reminder.
@BedfordBootBoy Not that I'm aware of.
@KetanJ0 @WORMSStweet @FullyChargedShw And yet there are brilliant electric leaf blowers available with lower running costs... if you really need to blow leaves..
@WORMSStweet @FullyChargedShw @KetanJ0 Yes, they did, it was very annoying but it was either sit in a quieter room that was swelteringly hot, or staying in the shade and breeze outside. Apologies
@ToyotaPR @freezingonsite @flexibledragnet @Toyota @ToyotaGB I was mildly annoyed by the strap line 1st time I saw it, slightly more annoyed by TV commercial, but just shrugged. Then the torrent of comments about it on my Twitter feed has not stopped. It's really annoyed people which might suggest a re-think? I love the Prius!!
@Brexit______ @evmanuk @Toyota Not only Kia, Mitsubishi are doing the same thing too, so they're all at it in one way or another. Still not good though, people who've never driven hybrid or electric are asking what 'self charging electric car' means. Not surprising.
@fjmanders @WiebeWkkr @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw Yes, definitely trying to meet up with Wiebe, we interviewed him when he was in Dubai.
@Brexit______ @Toyota @evmanuk So, you support brexit and you use terms like 'plebs' and you don't trust 'experts' but you're happy to trust the ASA (run by experts) to do the right thing. I'm not in the least confused. Carry on :-)
@pmansf77 @Toyota I had 3, not all at once of course. Toyota make brilliant cars which is why this is so sad and unnecessary.
@pmansf77 @Toyota I would describe it as spreading mild FUD. In the advert they subtly include a shot of a man 'waiting' for an electric car to charge, clearly implying that a fossil burning car with a small battery is superior. Clearly it isn't.
@brexit4life @dunkerley21 @afneil You're welcome, and I never co-hosted Robot Wars, although I know someone who did.
@total_philth @Toyota Wow, I drove 3 different Prius' for years,  brilliant cars, brilliant technology but I know I never got anywhere near 73% zero tailpipe emissions. That means it was running on electricity only for 73% of the time! Very skilled drives at the University of Rome.
@Fastardo @paullewismoney LOL
@S0ulA55a551n2 @Toyota Oh yes, and one refinery (there are 3 massive ones in the UK) uses the same amount of electricity each year as Leicester.  Which is quite a lot. So, when you buy petrol, you're also paying for some megawatt hours to refine the oil.
@S0ulA55a551n2 @Toyota Just want to correct you about 'most.' In the UK, more and more regularly, 'most' electricity comes from wind and solar, now near zero coal, the rest is gas and nuclear.
@gridrunners @IzzyWizzyIoniq @WriterBLAlley @Toyota I do know that which is in part why I'm upset by this ludicrous campaign.
@S0ulA55a551n2 @Toyota It is better, much better. No question about it. That's not what I'm grumpy about.
@gridrunners @WriterBLAlley @Toyota You clearly don't know my history and why should you. I was a passionate advocate of the Prius when it was launched in the UK back in the late 90's, I've had 3, all brilliant cars. However, they all used petrol.The 'self charging' makes them sound electric, which they are not.
@helenczerski @Toyota Wow, that is spooky.
@pmansf77 @Toyota I'm slightly surprised by that response. Toyota, one of the biggest manufacturers in the world, who make amazing reliable cars, are running a demonstrably inaccurate and deceptive ad campaign and I should keep quiet.
@freezingonsite @Toyota @ToyotaGB Wow, that's a little bit insecure of the PR dept, I know some of them. This is clearly a very touchy subject for them.
@brexit4life @dunkerley21 @afneil Ooh, you really know how to land a punch. Whammo, that's put me right back in my place in the gutter. You should be a comedy writer, you're that sharp and witty. Top marks all the way.
@WORMSStweet @KetanJ0 As I'm about to record another episode with Jonny, I don't think that's the case.
@alexcferrara @KetanJ0 @Carpervert Thank you, just what we needed to see, we're about to record another episode
@PoindexterMk1 @Toyota Never start a comment with 'sorry.' And what magazine?
But before that, here’s the latest episode from the Fully Charged Show podcast featuring the wonderful @KetanJ0   https://t.co/5Xk9BkinEa
I think I can feel a gentle rant coming on about the ‘self charging hybrids’ nonsense being put out by @Toyota   #Shameful
@brexit4life @dunkerley21 @afneil Ouch, that comment is so cutting, it's really taught me a lesson. I'm a washed up old has-been with no future which has caused me to totally change my opinion and become a rabid flag waving nationalist. Thank you.
@Sisquo12 @PeterLoxham @afneil Thank you for once again responding so eloquently. Your addition to the greater discussion around the global adoption of lower impact energy technology and the reduction of fossil fuel usage is greatly appreciated.
@dunkerley21 @afneil Obviously I'm blocking you not because we don't agree, but because you're boring. You use all the copy and paste criticisms from the reactionary angry old white bloke almanac. Pointless and dull.
@dunkerley21 @afneil Oh excellent, go for the cheap, reactionary 'celeb' put down, don't work with me pal, I'm not a celeb, never have been, and you're buying into the lovely fossil lobby funded batshit arguments to help them maintain their massive public subsidies. Mug.
@jecshepherd @afneil I'm only visiting and I know that's a complete fabrication, not true, in fact I'll go a little further. You know it's not true and you're lying to maintain support for the massively subsidised fossil fuel industry which now knows its days are numbered. FUD all the way.
@quixoticgeek Oh Goodness me, yes of course. Clearly Kryten's gender awareness chip has got a bit fossilised, will rectify
@PeterLoxham @afneil Well that really advances the discussion, thank you so much for your valuable contribution.
@MhehedZherting @JasonWStanley @afneil @OldDP Good heavens, are you still prattling on. It's fine, we get it, you hate all so called 'green energy' systems.  Go and dig up some coal for goodness sake, the clean stuff obviously,
@MhehedZherting @JasonWStanley @afneil @OldDP Oh you're really on one aren't you. Carry on, knock yourself out, it's fun to watch, well, not really but carry on anyway.
@LynnMcD61564763 @James_McKemey @afneil Commenting on supposed ageist insults when I'm nearly as old as him, how pathetically sad and pointless.
@dennis_p @BobTregilus @KiwiEV Eeeeuuw, that does look like a very expensive minor error. I've never tried to drive one with the doors open so don't know if it's possible. Maybe the car was static and the building moved.... that's what I'd say to insurance assessor :-)
@bigjsl @DoctorKarl @FullyChargedShw I managed to extract the relevant clip. I'd completely forgotten I did this. https://t.co/Cw3wg7AR6j
@j13_jr Oh Lordy, I have no idea. It's on Amazon UK here: https://t.co/7Qt2t7wbpR
@bigjsl @DoctorKarl @FullyChargedShw In case you're interested (and this is a very old episode) at 9 minutes 10 seconds, I ran a roadside noise test for electric and combustion cars back in 2010. https://t.co/uz0tolxwNk
@James_McKemey @afneil What he was clearly implying was that 100mWh wouldn't last very long if it was powering the entire Australian eastern seaboard. As you say, it's not designed to do that. Like all old fossils he mocks the technology from an ignorant position spreading FUD. Classic and sad.
@murray_w @afneil @simonahac Doing everything I can to arrange that, we are in touch
@JasonWStanley @afneil Very hard to do in a tweet. Mr Neil assumes that all the battery does is dump the entire capacity into the grid in one go.  It never does that, it helps with grid balancing, storing excess renewable during low demand, releasing during high demand. (It also makes money)
@au_tom_otive @106Euan @SimonFieldV6 @Carpervert Okay, I wan't really thinking clearly, I've just woken up, there's the i8, the Audi eTron A3, the Ampera.
@embaachu @afneil @Tesla @evtv Beautiful response.
@afneil An excellent example of how narrow thinking allows old reactionaries tom reject new technology. You have just displayed high levels of total ignorance on the role of the battery in South Australia. Well done.
@Carpervert @SimonFieldV6 Yeah but can you get them 2nd hand, maybe he could buy yours... no! Don't sell it.
@Richard28861 @Carpervert I heard last night that a couple of kilometres south of where I was walking a surfer got attacked by 'an immature great white.' Thankfully he survived and was flown to hospital, but he was an Aussie, not a Pom, so the shark would have been disappointed. :-)
A human comment classified as 'most kind' sir. Thank you, really pleased to hear you enjoyed it. https://t.co/oqa8hHaDqN
@SimonFieldV6 @Carpervert The obvious one is the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, with a range of around 25 miles on battery power, and it's petrol.
@WORMSStweet Yes, good point, I was always doing that, haven't had to do it in... maybe a year!
@WiebeWkkr Brilliant pics.
@Chris_Smith_S @FullyChargedShw Amazing. We should be very proud of this achievement, okay, Danish company, but made in Humberside.
@Carpervert @bengillam @IWMDuxford I'd never heard about it, and specifically an electric car. You'd think they'd just throw in some old Morris engine or something. Such a strange story.
@timmythorpev1 Unfortunately, and sometimes to the annoyance of my Mrs, people have recognised me from behind 'by the way I walk' so possibly not as ridiculous as it may sound.
@SandyBrown28 I'm flattered to be called middle aged, and it also means I'll live to be 124 years old. Nice. Thanks.
@vattuvarg That's one for @FullyChargedDan but it sounds like a very good idea
@notalotyoucando Totes starkers mate... the world is always desperate to see a naked 62 year old bloke on the beach....  (I was not naked, just for the record)
@bengillam @Carpervert That is such an amazing and Bonkers British story. Who'd - a - thunk it.
Engage #smugmode (Just been for a 2 hour beach walk) https://t.co/uz0lTIJQD6
@MrCrouton80 @alexcferrara @WiebeWkkr I really hope so, I'm in touch with @WiebeWkkr and we're trying to work out a time and place. It's quite difficult, Australia is rather large. #workingonit
@swcrisis @otfrom I'm very glad for you, you clearly know all there is to know about everything. I don't think I'll ever achieve such supreme confidence in my own superiority, so please don't judge me for my many failings.
@Wilko_UK I wonder if you'd be offended if a 15 year old called you a 'tired out, bigoted boring old fart.'  I'm sure you're none of those, so calling them little shits really doesn't help your quite questionable argument. :-)
I'm retweeting this to specifically annoy some men who think all these kids are middle class whingers who should just buckle down and not question grown ups. https://t.co/frOF3kGrbw
@LordEdam Some people suggest something is a good idea. It get's some popular support on Twitter. The immediate reaction, find a way to denigrate, belittle and criticise anyone and anything to do with it. Classic reactionary, knee jerk response and quite boring.
@MikeTonge @flyingbadger Glad I'm 12,000 miles away then :-)
@flyingbadger Sorry, I always use too many consonants.
@Neil_Skinner I cannot imagine why young people aren't supporting the current UK government wholeheartedly. They are such a wonderful example of competent, long term 'country before party' governance.
For those of you in 'Strayla I've posted a short news episode recorded in steamy Brisbane. https://t.co/9vkmmt1MSC
@Neil_Skinner A 'lefty rant.' Is that what it was. Worrying about the climate is just a load of 'lefty waffle' and we should buckle down and burn more fossil fuel. Okay then. Got it.
@Neil_Skinner So what was it about then?
@LuciusPaisley I think that's the first and possibly only time that my name will be of help in a food bank, and hats off to you sir for working there.
If my kids were still at school I'd be behind them 100% on this decision.  The actions being taken by my generation are minuscule and they need to be massive. https://t.co/JFZeoCbOZF
@VKozlovskii @eveecars I have to say that's a little bit tempting, brilliant idea and great website too. We might be in touch :-)
@Michael_Seaword @FullyChargedDan @EVNewsDaily @106Euan @ManMadeMoon @DavidHsearch @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @transportevolve I don't wish to be controversial but I think we should focus our dislike on toxic political views, examples of inhumanity, cruelty etc. I cannot see the difference between Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. They are all vile in their own way, hate all of them maybe.
@DJRonanDevitt @Nightline Oh Lord, that is really not good. The poor woman, and her family. Maybe this casual non helmet wearing is not such a hot idea.
The comments on #FullyChargedShow episodes are a wonderful mix of humour, information and passionate discussion. We are blessed. https://t.co/JfuDk1OOD2
@revsorg One of the finest analogies I've seen. Spot on.
Some #fullychargedshow news from Australia.  https://t.co/JfuDk1OOD2
@mineralmancam I wish... wait, is there one in Australia?
@windydan155 At them moment old locomotives like the one in the picture don't have modern batteries, so I would imagine that's one reason. Newer trains will and will undoubtedly use region braking. It would save £££ or even $$$
A perfect example of a 'self charging hybrid.' LOL https://t.co/RzDU2R4khy
I  think it's good news.... https://t.co/jfAUWDeg2A
@Gurmehar_0117 @Carpervert No, not Auntie Peggy. She's got classic taste.  :-)
@Carpervert That looks well posh, like my Auntie's front room in 1973.
@richnash82 @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert They are definitely coming, hoping to do a bit of electric earth moving this year on #fullychargedshow this year. #diggers
@emyrderfel @mwt2008 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw We both have pop filters but I do possibly have quite powerful plosives. Years of theatre darling, I can project across the Mojave desert.
@PourACupOfJoe @mwt2008 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Well neither of us smoke or vape, and I don't think anyone was eating, that would be very rude.
@mwt2008 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Really glad you like it and I agree, my levels do seem to fluctuate, I do tend to get a bit animated and will try to maintain a constant distance from the mic in future :-)
@MrKilpingBanana @FullyChargedShw @Patreon @Carpervert @SonoMotors Great story, thank you
We had a wonderful time, thanks for all your help. https://t.co/iFJxRNIVFO
Just got up here in Australia and the big hot yellow thing in the sky is not apparent, it's gone all Brexshitty and grey. Feel very at home.
@Phrog_Frog @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Good suggestion. I’m on it.
@Carpervert @auscatsbum @FullyChargedShw Yeah yeah, whatev's  :-)
@auscatsbum @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert To be accurate, one of them has a vacuum system built into the groinal area, a subtle difference I know sir, but one I thought worth mentioning. And the other is a pervert.
@mrjacktanner Cassettes, reel to reel, and we're working on carving small stone tablets and strapping them to pigeons

As often happens with new technological developments, opinion is divided. "Best idea ever! Love it." or "The most stupid, offensive, piece of rubbish built on lies and deciet, I'm livid!' @SonoMotors Sion https://t.co/iKDjefm7gq
@BassmanBowman @SonoMotors If you put a dynamo on each wheel, they would absorb more power than they would create. All electric cars have regenerative braking, meaning as you slow down you get to store some of the kinetic energy embodied in the m moving vehicle as it slows.
If you watch the entire episode the folks from Sono Motors explain, solar panels on the car can add a bit of range, but  you can't drive all day relying on them to keep the batteries full. It's an additional way of charging. https://t.co/iKDjefm7gq
@gaja9314 @SonoMotors @lightyear_cars Yes, very interested in Lightyear Cars. Clever folks at Eindhoven, have a very impressive track record with solar and cars
"Why can't you put solar panels on a car and charge it as you drive?" A question we've been asked a lot. here's one possible answer. The @SonoMotors Sion, first drive. https://t.co/iKDjefm7gq
@BeardyTechie @FullyChargedShw The GridWatch tab has been on my browser for the last 7 years, and yes, it's very good.
Just been to see "On the Basis of Sex" which is brilliant, but heavens above Australian Cinemas are cold. It's a relief to get back out into the steamy night air.
@harrogatebus @harrogate_stuff @BBCLookNorth @spencerstokestv @BBCiPlayer @BBCLeeds @BBCYork @FullyChargedShw @StrayFM @HgateAdvertiser @Transdev @the_tpa That's very good to hear, can't wait to come and see them in action
What a tangled web we weave https://t.co/VU3vbO1Lfk
We drove through the beautiful Hunter Valley on our way from Sydney to Brisbane. This is indeed very good news. https://t.co/BzjLqIHgyf
@harrogate_stuff @harrogatebus @BBCLookNorth @spencerstokestv @BBCiPlayer @BBCLeeds @BBCYork @FullyChargedShw @StrayFM @HgateAdvertiser @Transdev @the_tpa The BBC reported there was a temporary diesel generator at one station, they reported that last year, so yes, the BBC do know and clearly it's a temporary (and ridiculous) measure
@Abusefield @SkyNews @nico_rosberg @FullyChargedShw I think we're already involved. It's in the diary
@NewTechnologyY2 @FullyChargedShw Yes, and sort of because as soon as I get back I'm off again shooting some exciting electric stuff on land and sea
@Hiimgrief @DannyJohnJules Very important point that @FredBorloo made, politicians are voted in to represent us, the people, not some silly little team, very much the same garbage is spouted about which party is better in the UK. As we are currently seeing, they are both crap
@WilHarris @limebike It's coming, and it will be deeply humiliating for me.
@bluesdomo As the technology has developed very rapidly, if you can afford to buy new, that's probably better, but 2nd hand electric cars are great and you won't need to replace the battery for years
@blackmore_s @abcnews @Caroline_Winter @StatistaCharts Which suggests once again that research  quoted by professional journalists at major news organisations is fairly unreliable. Come on @abcnews
@shandcunt True, but then your tweet was writted perfiktlee.
In case you are not aware of @limebike they are not short of a few bob. And I've just paid them another 5 bucks. https://t.co/l5iVuUK899
@MikeTonge @limebike I did actual, proper, mature out loud laughing. Very funny.
That thing where you re-read a tweet you've just posted, and you'd checked it, and read it out, and made sure you hadn't stuffed up, and then notice it reads  "I zipped along but the river"   not "I zipped along by the river." Poo buckets to that.
Just got back from doing my errands in town (Brisbane) and I zipped along but the river on a @limebike and felt like a marginally older hipster. #electricscooter #smashedavo #grilledhaloumi #manbun And I just missed a tropical downpour. Nice
As @DannyJohnJules would say. Boom! https://t.co/wVjWtQlwAl
@soledadobrien Very sad news but what a wonderful photograph of your parents. You dad was clearly a very special man.
@SherbetKirsty Oh dear, I hope things improve for you. I'm married to an Aussie so we've been doing family catch up, visiting mates and next week, for a bit, we might get to walk on a beach. I'll have a shallow paddle, the Mrs will dive into massive waves.

@lovingthepanda I don't think I can be accused of being a Tesla fan boy. I've driven every electric car there is, they're all better than combustion cars. That said, I've had a Tesla for 4 years, it has been incredibly reliable and the service it's had (minimal) has been fine.
@GlynMoss1000 Mate, Brisbane this week, Northern NSW next week, all over the shop but not NZ sadly. One day soon I hope
@polaleeks In the Antipodes, lovely and warm, considering my options :-)

@MAWalke12024508 Oh, my feed is bursting with Trumpy goodness and Green New Deal optimism, I follow a lot of Americans. It's my mentions column that's quiet.

The thing about being on the other side of the planet from my home country is.... twitter is really quiet. I'm not saying that's good or bad, but the news from the UK at the moment is not overly confidence inspiring. And breath in .  . . and relax.
@tryevs I don't know who made this but it won't have been @Tesla, and I don't think the ending is indicating bladder weakness :-)

@ShacklefordPI @ManMadeMoon I hadn't heard about that. Quite a long walk, quite hot.
@The_PlugSeeker @EVMaps Thank you sir. Much appreciated
Oooh, nice, not seen this one before https://t.co/qOmr0EEAdO
When I ponder on just how big Australia is, this illustration really helps. https://t.co/zulVe0Vvqi
@au_tom_otive @baxter_wa @thegrandtour @TopGearEditor Very true. Sorry, I didn't notice that, the magazine is very very different to the TV show
@GranpappaJohn An excellent question sir, with one simple answer: https://t.co/rlBaoYw9mw
Well there's no need to go over the top. But thanks :-) https://t.co/ygSOICEPa9
@Beat_Root Thank you Kev, really glad you're enjoying it.
@Stowe101 You really helped launch the whole thing Don, so thank you mate, hope all is well.
We are all discreetly chuffed that @FullyChargedShow has just passed 50 million views.  I'd like to thank the many thousands of people around the world who've watched and supported us over the years. Woot! 50 million views!!
@blackmore_s @ReflexFunds @Gfilche @riversimple @FullyChargedShw This also might be why @Tesla have just bought an ultracapacitor company called Maxwell Technologies for about $218 million.
@NewTechnologyY2 Took this last week in Sydney. Any good? https://t.co/51LQT8yk15
@mrleewhitfield @LeilaniMunter @FullyChargedShw We can only hope. We definitely want her to attend. I have all digits crossed (which makes typing difficult)
@chrisgrinter56 @simonahac @Tesla Okay, I don't know if you have a point, but I do think there needs to be better solutions than driving inefficient combustion cars burning finite and toxic fuels to cover long distances. (Fuel cost Sydney to Brisbane free in a Tesla, in another electric car, $80-100)
@HristianHel @chrisgrinter56 @simonahac @Tesla Yep, and I'm only a tourist, and happy about it :-) Only masochists with bladder problems in their future drive for 10 hours non stop.
What an amazing achievement. Leilani rocks. Check out the video. https://t.co/0ss8SRMSen
@chrisgrinter56 @simonahac @Tesla So you drive for 3 or 4 hours, stop for 30 minutes, then carry on. The Model X I drove has a range of over 400 k on a charge.
@chrisgrinter56 @simonahac @Tesla I don't think I understand, but there are many Tesla drivers who've driven from Sydney to Brisbane in a day. The cars charge in 20-30 minutes
@TonyPolony22 @simonahac @Tesla No, they are the same sockets on European and Australian Tesla's, but at the moment no other car can use them. The sockets and plugs send power but also communicate, so you can plug another car in but it won't charge
@Egzasa @Model3_CH @Tesla Yes. https://t.co/O2EpKz9gGP
@chrisjamesgee @NewTechnologyY2 Forget the spiders, it's the stick insects, very incorrectly names. It should be 'tree-branch insects.' They are massive and they fly at you.
Here you go @NewTechnologyY2  Warm Brisbane morning. https://t.co/ckmMKUk2Oh
@pvtbanner I've been to the gym every day since we've been here, I am ripped and pipped, okay, mildly pumped... gently a bit fitter... for a man my age.
Early morning Brisbane observation. Been sitting outside since 5am, lots of mozzies of course, but an equal number of grey haired ladies and gentlemen out jogging, seriously fit, chatting away as if they were sitting around having a coffee.
@rjward76 @Tesco Hey, steady, don't make sensible, sustainable suggesting like that! No no, much better to give incentives to encourage people to drive a 3 ton diesel SUV to buy a litre of milk.
@GettinTwitta @Tesco @LidlUK @Pod_Point Exactly, did you hear that @Tesco  @LidlUK are leaving you in the dust.
@CrampedEyes @EVNewsDaily @DeanFieldingF1 @mwt2008 Good place to start would be NewMotion https://t.co/K94ubwNlqw and Ionity https://t.co/xyGH3bqgAv
Good point, come on @Tesco, get those chargers installed and start encouraging EV drivers to shop at your stores. https://t.co/vRCdCDMwkv
@gohn @FullyChargedShw @ScotEVDrivers @Carpervert Uuum, memory man here, I heard this at a Renault dealers conference about 2 years ago, I can just about real what happened last week, so I'm sorry, no idea.
@robfarago @tsport100 Oooh, that's nice and fast. Hmmm, Burleigh Heads eh.
@sadknob LOL, sounds very familiar
@dennis_p @trytohelpyou1 @MartinWoolleyUK @Tesla It is all down to regulations. During a power failure (outage) you can't currently use a Powerwall to run our home. You have to install some expensive isolation tech to make sure it's  safe for people to fix the affected lines. That's my current understanding
@tsport100 Actually that's pretty decent
@_garywhite_ I should have pointed out that before we had fibre, our internet speeds (very rural) were comically pathetic. We even lost connection when a squirrel nested in a junction box
@tendencies87 That's clever because I've just bought an expensive coffee, so the plan works!
So clearly New Zealand doesn't have the same issue. https://t.co/P8NIWXwsuA
I am clearly spoilt, we have fibre to the door at home the UK, download about 880 mps, upload closer to 950. Here, upload is 0.5. So I won't be sending any 4 gig files to the office.
Brilliant response! https://t.co/p7r91Z7Hwa
I am experiencing glacially slow interweb speeds in sunny Brisbane, and I don't care. Okay, it was raining a bit this morning, but it was warm rain, so I don't care
What Beth said https://t.co/ybc3A4dvNn
@BenIrvineAuthor @JamesDelingpole Sadly I know far more about him and his reactionary opinions than is healthy. There's no moral high ground to seize, that's such a childish, sulky Brietbart argument. You forgot to user the term 'virtue signalling' by the way.
@DannyJohnJules Ahhh, memories :-)
@BenIrvineAuthor @JamesDelingpole 100% pointless to say anything then.
@MLiebreich @JamesDelingpole Very true. Yes, nobody should see that particular car crash. :-)
@RogerV52 @JamesDelingpole That's too cryptic for me to understand. You're obviously blisteringly clever.
@southamman @JamesDelingpole What a truly pathetic, limp-wristed, unoriginal attempt at a put down. #tragic

@eTaxiCharging @LondonEVCompany @HeathrowAirport @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert There's no question that is a high cost, but I can't help wondering if running the range extender engine on petrol is cheaper?  And electric drive train is so much more efficient so the 32.2p could take you further than 32.2p's worth of petrol? Just asking.
@eTaxiCharging @LondonEVCompany @HeathrowAirport @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Do you know how much they're charging? Per kilowatt hour etc.
@Bankerman60 @JamesDelingpole You guess away pal. Tedious and pointless response.
@thataussieguy1 @emersonbiggens @living_DEDgirl "Are you telling me Perry Como sang "Memories are Made of This" with one of those stashed in his slacks!"
@ben1976johnson Did I say the fuel froze? I don't think so, but the efficiency of there engine is badly affected by extreme cold, and decades of technological development have gone into making combustion engines deal with low temps.
@Lighthugger_Cpt I've heard similar things, but just want to point out that all Hydrogen Fuel Cell cars are, by necessity, hybrid electric. They all have to have a large battery pack to operate.
@Nethertrews Sorry, my overly rapid Twitter assumption. Good on you mate. Sydney is amazing. Enjoy 😊
what he said: https://t.co/N8coh0R53U
Well yes, there is that... https://t.co/4EC2HLqfWa
@steven_laing @crazycol Just in case you have any interest  https://t.co/JXDHzmkmPM
@Nethertrews Yes, thankfully your president understand the complex science of climate change. Unlike those pesky climate scientists. They just make shit up for the LOLz :-)
@BodDamnIt @FullyChargedDan Not necessarily, although they are a prime target for the fossil lobby. It's not untrue, extreme cold will have an affect but as the tech develops they will be able to mitigate it to some extent. I remember my dad's engine block splitting in 1963 winter, not enough anti freeze
@RupertGrumpGeek Thanks, yes can't wait to have a go on a Lime scooter, they're all over the place. Coffee yes, beer, I like but I get silly and use bad words after a sip. #lightweight
@Jays200 @Tesla Amazing that you did that. I take my sun hat off to you sir. I once fantasised about being first person to circumnavigate Australia in an electric car. LOL. Only 10 years too late
@BodDamnIt @FullyChargedDan Well, thoughts are fairly simple. In very low temperatures, you need anti freeze in combustion cars or the engine block splits. You use 15-20% more fuel, you need to warm up the engine wasting fuel. Very cold temps have an effect...on everything.
Heartbreaking and common sadly https://t.co/avl92wfbF5

@BikerOpen Oh seriously, I mean I can appreciate the roar of a powerful motorbike, but this guy was taking the piss. 6 in the morning, going slowly, revving the shit out of the bike. He was 'making a noise' rather than simply riding.
6:30am. Suburban Brisbane, cool morning, light rain, lovely bird fellas hopping about.  Then the noisiest motorbike I've ever heard roared past, mildly annoying.  This was soon followed by a Tesla Model S and a Nissan Leaf, then a hipster on an electric scooter. #changingtimes
@au_tom_otive @adamvaughan_uk @StvCr @Petercampbell1 @dgbailey @theseoldcars @FullyChargedDan @torquespeak I love western European sense of humour, which is why we will invade soon.

@Base_leg @Tesla The best solution to that is don't buy a Tesla. There are an increasing number of electric alternatives with high quality door. The Jaguar I-Pace, the Audi e-Tron etc.
@Rhodesjnr @iajanus @Dave_Oakden @Tesla Very much so: @Dave_Oakden tweeted this to me.  11.5 hrs in model x, 10.5 in long range model 3.
@SANEAlex_ @Uva_Be You may possibly be referring to 'the News from' trilogy. News from Gardenia News from the Squares News from the Clouds
@pluginadventure @Tesla @WiebeWkkr I hope to hook up with Wiebe in early March. We are in touch
@alexeiw123 @Tesla We bought a lovely bottle of red from Cassagrain, for my brother in laws birthday. Lovely place, nice lunch
@Mike_H_1977 @Tesla It doesn't affect battery life, but very cold weather reduces the range a little (not that you'd notice non a Tesla) in the same way that a car that can do 40 mpg in summer will do 35 in winter.
@the_scotsman_ @Tesla I've done it in a day before, I'm not a masochist, we had the time and chilled. You could easily do it in a day in a Tesla.
@mrleewhitfield @Tesla I know we're terrible, and no smoking spiders but I did walk into a web in a mates garden the other night. Bit spooky.
@shandcunt @Tesla I love the heat, I'm sweating like an unwashed pom but Im love it. Mmmmm. Sticky.
@Dave_Oakden @Tesla No longer than a sensible person driving a combustion engined car would take. It took 2 days and we never 'waited to charge.' We charged while we had lunch, stayed in a motel with a destination charger, charged while we slept, and again today charged over lunch.
Just driven from Sydney to Brisbane (957km or 594 miles) in a Tesla Model X.  It was easy.  There will be a #FullyCharged episode about it soonish. I want to thank @Tesla Australia for the loan. Truly amazing car https://t.co/II8ug03mAa
@foxlandscaping1 I did buy one after Bosch lent me that one, I've been using it for the past couple of years and it's been faultless and, due to the fact a lot of the ground we cut grass is on very rough ground, it's amazingly tough and resilient. Can't recommend highly enough.
@theimp67 @MikeHudema Have a google for Ivanpah in California, same idea, slightly bigger.
@DannyJohnJules OOOh my God! Dan, Dan, Dan, why don't we release it as a Dramady Podcast like @LuckePhil suggested... oh wait, 'cos I don't have a spare 3 seconds let alone weeks, but we should try
@akwaugh Why isn't there a movie about this starring Benedict Cumberbatch
@willdymott I want to know what the yoo ad is? A link?
This is profoundly shameful. My Uncle Tom was a in a British tank regiment that arrived at a concentration camp in 1945. He took pictures with his box brownie camera. I saw the snaps. I can never forget them. https://t.co/Mjg0xknxc7
@StephenWensley @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw One day. I hope. Looks amazing
@StaceyFurUK @FullyChargedShw Oh yes, that would be great but I think they'd tinker it to bits :-)
@StaceyFurUK @FullyChargedShw It's partly to do with the fact that I really don't want them to. More people watch Fully Charged around the world than would if we made it for a UK terrestrial channel.

@horizonaccount @m_xalher @JonDeeOz @Arnesenanton @EVNewsDaily @B_McBeardface @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @106Euan @elonmusk @evmanuk @Carpervert Internal Combustion Engine.
@AndrewCruzeUK @BoringPrufrock @william_sw @elonmusk I really dislike this discussion because it's painfully obvious HFC and or BEV is a vast improvement on any flavour of ICE. For me it's more a question of overall energy efficiency, in that arena BEV's are leagues ahead. And the Hydrogen Lobby has the Fossil Lobby behind it.
@Gr33nGreen No, none of  the above. It's simply about numbers, there are so many EVs in Norway and some cars crash in icy conditions (could be another car hitting an EV) that there is a healthy supply of parts from wrecks. I would say from experience EV's safer in snow and ice.
@rulefiftyseven @Pete_Knight_ We do totally agree that for a complex and nuanced discussion Twitter is beyond rubbish. If, for some unfathomable reason you managed to construe that I likened you to the Orange One, I apologise, but then you did call me a cock, which I don't find offensive. :-)
@rulefiftyseven @Pete_Knight_ At no point did I suggest or state that you are in any way like Trump. The oft reported arguments you tried to make are falling to bits. That's your arguments. Which are similar to the Trump regime. You are not similar to Trump
@Muslidrikk @FullyChargedShw I agree. If we simply replace every ICE car with an electric one, we solve many problems but introduce some new ones. I think the biggest issue we face is the issue of private ownership. We have to start sharing transportation.
@StephenWorth10 @UNICEF @GretaThunberg Yes, they should just ignore the evidence, shut up and get a job.... or something
@william_sw @elonmusk That is your worst tweet to date. It lets you down, let's your arguments down, makes you look petty and bitter. A HFC car could be just as badly built. That video shows shoddy build quality, it's got zero to do with the propulsion system. Just saying.
@rulefiftyseven @Pete_Knight_ Sorry, you are more wrong and time will tell. We can easily be 100% renewably powered, particularly in the UK, all the tired old arguments against this are crumbling like the house of Trump.
@rulefiftyseven Of course you can, but the 'where does the electricity come from' question is the one used endlessly by the fossil fuel lobby. Where does the electricity come from that allows you to tweet? In the UK, 30-35% from renewables.
@willtomuk @MichaelSkolnik That's a very weak excuse, he 'gave it a go' because he inherited a massive fortune from his father. He squandered it in ego obsessed self aggrandisement and endless failure. There are so many far more worthy individuals who have achieved success from far humbler origins.
@rulefiftyseven @Pete_Knight_ And this is a ridiculous statement based on pure ignorance. Electricity can and is increasingly coming from renewables, we don't need the mythical 'base load.' It's utter nonsense.
@rulefiftyseven The question you could be asking is where does the electricity come from that's used to refine crude oil? Which is then burned in inefficient combustion engines.

@rulefiftyseven @Pete_Knight_ I think it's worth considering that in grid engineer circles, the notion of 'base-load' is becoming redundant. We don't need a base-load, it's a myth although a very popular one that's constantly repeated by the gas and nuclear lobby.
@mwt2008 Okay, I've got to point out the pedantic aspect of my former tweet. I used the word 'today.' As in, everything else listed could be electrically powered today, planes a bit more tomorrow.
@MetalGuru73 Well, we've got to wait 25-30 years. 10-15 years in a car, then 10-15 years as static storage, then they are recycled, which h is expensive but over 95% of the materials can be used again. So a problem, but not impossible, and they will not be 'thrown into landfill.'
Everything except aircraft can be electric today. Cars, bikes, vans, trucks, busses, and of course boats. #FullyChargedShow https://t.co/P1dkYjVQ4R

@PloughboyBris Yes, more than I expected, saw a mint condition 2012 Nissan Leaf, wish mine looked like that. Quite a few Teslas and certainly a lot of interest.

@JohnBuckoke @FullyChargedShw Thank you John, I think you're right, and people like Greta should make everyone stop and reflect on how they live. Yes, I have solar, I'm vegetarian, drive EV's but I've also just flown half way around the world. #conflicted
@MikeTonge @NewElectric @InkSharkman To be fair too @InkSharkman he was cramped into a tiny electric boat and possibly had less fun on the canal than we did.
@TheMinxyMissK @NewElectric I often don't get jokes, especially on Twitter, but I got that one. Bah-dhum-tish. Thank you very much!
@cleevelymotors @FullyChargedShw No, I haven't lost a tooth, LOL, maybe I've just developed a lisp in old age. I've no idea

@JohnBuckoke I hope so, sometime, although I know I'm very much part of the problem she is so right to point to. Love what she's doing at Davos.
@FerndaleLouise I don't believe you. It was a mildly hidden 'you are an elitist' jibe based on the tragic pretext of one mass produced computer product being better/worse/different from another. And assuming that the use of a particular product says something about the user.
@Yorkie71 @Carpervert I have a new Mic, the one I used for the first recording is rubbish and about 10 years old. The new episodes should sound a lot better
@FerndaleLouise I haven't 'fallen' for anything. I made a conscious choice based on many years of experience and multiple discussions with professionals in m media production. I have no allegiance to any computer type based on some tragic 'tribal' reasoning. Does that address your assumptions?
@turbogeek421 @Carpervert I'm using a new mic and it will sound much better. I was always a consistent distance from the mic. The old mic was a bit wibbly wobbly and knackered.
Just about to record another episode of the #FullyChargedShow Podcast with @Carpervert  It's an international episode, me in Sydney Australia in my jim jams, Jonny in blighty in thermals. Coming on every podcast feed imaginable soon
@EricLesley2 It's very high on the list. So yes, definitely
@queeg2001 @SkyNews Ah yes, the old hidden costs of 'cheap fossils.' And don't get me started on nuclear decommissioning which we'll be paying for generations into the never ending future

There are now alternative makes, same range, less than half the price. (Hyundai Kona, Nissan Leaf, Kia Soul, Kia Niro) Wait a bit longer and there will be much cheaper alternatives. Just a thought.
@jemimakiss That’s possibly one of the most unpleasant tweets I’ve ever read 😆but also good points well made. There’s also the input impact. Meat production, anyway I bet the dog is gorgeous. We miss ours. But no poo bags anymore.
@ManMadeMoon @m_xalher @FullyChargedDan @Arnesenanton @EVNewsDaily @B_McBeardface @FullyChargedShw @106Euan @elonmusk @evmanuk @Carpervert Yeah, alright, rub it in. Can I touch it with one finger tip when you get it. I’ll wear gloves. 😬
@DeanFieldingF1 @PenPrecise @Lukafoto @B_McBeardface @DailyMailUK @FullyChargedDan Yes, I heard that, well, I read that in a report. Let's agree it's somewhere between 2 and 10%

We just had one of our regular production meetings and I'm very happy about the coming #FullyChargedShow episodes, and we're recording another #FullyChargedShowPodcast this week. It's all go.
@whelks_chance @tehcoder42 I know, I must be insane, but the first 6 years were a bit sporadic, it's only the last 3 that we'v e really been churning out the episodes.
@tehcoder42 @huby We're working on it. Basically using an electric car is not the same as the way we use combustion engines. You can refill it while you[re not using it, which is most of the time. Mine is always full in the morning
@DeanFieldingF1 @FullyChargedDan @raimonick @elonmusk @helenczerski @FullyChargedShw @The_PlugSeeker @jimalkhalili @LeilaniMunter @106Euan I love the notion that anything in the Daily Mail could ever be construed as 'far left propaganda, or that the very conservative people I've met who drive electric cars are likewise 'radical lefties.'  Thankfully I haven't read the comments but that's for posting these beauties
@tehcoder42 @huby I never wait to charge batteries, I do something useful. All cars are only in use 10% of the time, meaning you have 90% of the time you own the cart to charge it
@JohnBuckoke @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @iTunes Heavens no, it's on all platforms. Stitcher, Google Play Podcasts, Downcast, Podcatcher, Pocket Casts, Overcast, PodcastAddict and many more
@tehcoder42 Yes, I've heard these theories for decades, and I truly hope you are right. As long as people stop using diesel and petrol, I'm happy
@tehcoder42 I've been making Fully Charged for 9 years. I've driven every hydrogen fuel cell car that's been made (3) and they're great. It's brilliant technology that's always been about 15 years away. Trucks, busses, ships, trains yes yes. Definitely. Cars? Maybe.
@tehcoder42 I'm glad you know what the future is. I don't have a clue but currently battery tech is leaving everything else in the dust.
@sachinbahal @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert You got it in one. Poor fella. He's doomed!

@mariamcerlane I know! In was almost cute, for about 3 months. :-)  xx
@filsmyth Yes, I've often wondered how he 'grew it back.'
@rickhodson @Carpervert Thanks, really glad you enjoyed it. and don't worry, some super exclusive Honda stuff coming soon. V exciting.
Look at that hair. That was actually joined to my head. True blue Tory boy. https://t.co/7sowWovmNN
@macrae1988 What a brilliant well informed comment. We'd better tow all those redundant rigs back out to the North Sea, all those dried up oil wells will be full of freshly minted oil... from mineraly stuff.
@ouboters @MicrolinoWorld Would love to come to Zurich, we're planning a visit later this year.
This, more than any other pro EV journalism I’ve ever read proves that the big shift is happening. https://t.co/DEUwlFG8qw
@dan_jenkins I'm sure you're not. I'm checking with our Podcast Czar right now.

@MikeTonge It';s a really imaginative and artistic title.  The Fully Charged Show Podcast
Here's another link to 'The Fully Charged Podcast" Episode one now available  https://t.co/CjaJuysUim
This is a bit exciting. We've just launched the Fully Charged Podcast. It's available on all podcast download things, also on iTunes. https://t.co/Nt28lsgbeq
@SussexEVs @Carpervert I would love to, somehow all this Fully Charged nonsense takes up all my time, but I will try.
@accesser_jason Mate, I know about it. In fact I'll be there next week. Fresh Mango. Mmmm
I have just removed dozens of apps that had permission to infects my twitter output. I had no idea. Many thanks to @danielsamuels and @jessqssin
@danielsamuels @tweepsmap Thank you.
@GargoyleTwoZero @tweepsmap I'm sure I haven't authorised @tweepsmap, all I want to know now is how to unauthorised them.
Mildly worrying and annoying. I didn't send this Tweet. So who did? Wretched @tweepsmap. When did I give them permission to do that? https://t.co/KxKaPTpfv0

@AlanSloman @EmmaFidler @SonicFixRepairs @RenewableUK @AirvolutionEngy Whereas the communities threatened by hydraulic fracturing are overjoyed at having those sights next door. Very myopic attitude to the huge problems facing all off us. But then I'm supposed to feel shame at suggesting otherwise.
@AlanSloman @EmmaFidler @SonicFixRepairs @RenewableUK @AirvolutionEngy The avalanche of assumed knowledge in your response is likewise.
@EmberOfAsh Now you've got it! At last, the real conspiracy theories are coming under the glare of truth
@MikeTonge Yeah..., alright, but it's still hair!   :-)
@FiMatys We have some episodes about that very subject coming soon. Lots of activity in this area.
@AlanSloman @EmmaFidler @SonicFixRepairs @RenewableUK @AirvolutionEngy Not quite accurate, it's entirely because of the current government, and how long will they be almost in power for? Everyone thinks everyone else hates wind turbines whereas in all surveys conducted they are surprisingly popular. Particularly when people understand the reality.
Back when I had hair :-) https://t.co/UTE9eH6IFw
@zimpaz @Carpervert She may do, at a special 'antique car expo' or something, but without question the technology we use for transport will have gone electric by then.
@jeroenimus @SnellingDean @106Euan @FullyChargedShw Omg yes. We need to discuss soonest. Will be in touch - a -roochy
@JohnBuckoke @otleyshev68 @elonmusk @NYKChannel @lotsofbumper @KateFantom @ev_nero @evonestop @FullyChargedDan @sr_edy @pluginadventure @She_sElectric @TeslaInTheUK @JeremyClarkson I don't wish to speak for big Mr C but his livelihood depends of being a fervent advocate for the fossil fuel industry. The biggest fossil . . . . in the world.
@FreakyFwoof @Helidonkey Our Kona makes a sound like a lost whale at low speed
@CarlosfromCA I want to know what the big blind spot is.
@SonicFixRepairs @RenewableUK @AirvolutionEngy Maybe you don’t want them, but plenty of people do.
@JordeeGee OMG. Baby!  Lovely news. Big congrats x
Nice, a perfect portable production studio. Much likey https://t.co/kQlFKX3vf0
@dennis_p @jag35 I would love to, may have a to wait a while though.
@dennis_p @jag35 I know, I'm really happy about that. I love hot, but there's inside bits with air con. (Solar powered of course)
@fridgefreya @GavinFree Lovely story. Thank you. Of course it makes me feel even older but I'm used to that :-)
@dennis_p @jag35 Circuit of the Americas, Austin Texas. September 7-8 2019.
@EmmaKennedy Here you go. Very tasty. https://t.co/FIfGPVCGB9
As electric cars stay the same size, much the same weight but go much further on a charge you can tell things are shifting. The 2019 Kia Soul EV. https://t.co/u8Kw8WfNc7
@GavinFree It was a delight to meet you too sir. Will be in touch shortly.
@clixby @GavinFree He was with us today. Had a lovely chat with him.
Met many wonderful enthusiastic people at the pre launch event for FullyChargedLive USA Including my hero @jag35. Great to meet an EV legend https://t.co/uMcYDLdBi9
Getting ready for a small launch event. Very exciting and amazing people helping us at @COTA so bi thanks to the team https://t.co/qbWrhEFURP
@SnellingDean @MrJamesMay Excellent. That means they gave us money. Major league LOLz
As promised, right on time. The new Kia Soul EV, much longer range, and it's yellow!  https://t.co/u8Kw8WfNc7
@TheRealMike It's the schedule, nothing to do with me. The massive corporate structure of @FullyChargedShw dictates my every waking move :-)
@RandyVegetables I would be happy to, not sure Grant Naylor Red Dwarf prod company) would allow me and there's the cost, it's not a cheap makeup job, believe me. Maybe one day.
@2di2d It's looking hopeful, will find out today.
@selsoe @maddiemoate Indeed, without question @maddiemoate is going to be a very regular presenter on #FullyCharged. We start shooting more eps with her very soon.
There's a new episode of #FullyCharged coming in 27 minutes. Just thought I'd mention it. It's bright and colourful, I can say that for sure.
@DavRog74 It's impossible to reconcile. I've never claimed to be 'green.' 2 things. air travel accounts for 9% of global CO2 emissions and there are many other technologies that are easy to convert to renewable technologies, and electric aircraft (short haul) will be running in 5 years
@StephenF55 @DavRog74 We think about it a lot, it's a huge problem for me personally. However air travel accounts for 9% of global CO2 emissions, if the world ran on 100% renewable electricity it would be less of an issue. Plus electric passenger planes (short haul) coming in next 5 years
@chris6770 70 + charge points in one car park. Yeah, there will be some facilities, loads of catering and amazing cars on display etc.
@ChrisBlundell It's a bit misty at the moment but everyone we've met has been delightful. Seems like a very nice town.
@DJ_BigAnt I suppose because I started Fully Charged, and it's growing, and it seemed like good idea.
I'm currently in Austin Texas, we are here to launch 'Fully Charged Live' which will take place at The Circuit of the Americas' on 7 and 8 September this year. To use an olde English phrase, we are 'pumped and stoked' about it.
Been saying this for years. https://t.co/sqTVfAmtUd
@clixby @RoosterTeeth @GavinFree Thank you for that nugget. Will discuss
And just a passing suggestion of something more important https://t.co/pVO7cImFPM
Happy #BrexitShambles everyone.
@Carpervert @PeterRobinson76 @FullyChargedShw We never want you to stop Jonny but good luck with the gig. Britain is literally holding its breath.
Long term production planning meeting for #fullychargedshow https://t.co/SOfAoqFIwa
@thehistoryguy Sitting in a traffic snarl up near Stroud sir. Very enjoyable
@tomharle @ustwo It's so dense and fascinating. Really loving it, just a bit heavy to hold up in bed, I have to read it at a table :-)
Don’t normally retweet this kind of thing but these chaps are spectacular https://t.co/hTsU9xgisP
@thehistoryguy When I got up it was pitch black, I stubbed my toe, hobbled downstairs and put the kettle on, cleared the kitchen and had a cup of tea. Slightly less romantic sir. Hope you have a good time. Sounds amazing.
I love big books and I cannot lie. This is big, produced by @ustwo I’m very immersed. https://t.co/LxPQLy0MnO
@rarts I would love to do one, we will do this year (they're doing fine by the way) and I have collected a shed load of data. We are waiting for a bit of an 'update' to the system, so hopefully shooting something in the spring.
@KateFantom @106Euan @LemonTea_Leaf @vonredbeard @She_sElectric @pluginadventure @jtchivers @RenaultZoeClub @BethLilyRace @EVRevShow @The_PlugSeeker @ecocars1 @raimonick Great picture, such a lovely bunch of folks. Happy Birthday @106Euan
@PareshPanchal91 Gridwatch is one of my fave bookmarks. I now try not to watch it quite so obsessively :-)
@ADAMRHART @FullyChargedDan Keep an eye out for 'Fully Charged Live 2019' at Silverstone, 7-8-9 June as we'll have loads of companies attending with this kind of tech. And also, we will be doing episodes about the latest systems available
@roadster2021 Yes, there are now many 100% renewable energy companies in the UK, they invest all profits into expanding renewable generation
Worth mentioning, and currently coal is producing 1.46% of our electricity. Yes, this is not the case very day, but this happens a lot. 33% is impressive, no fuel burned, no imports needed. https://t.co/h9vcdm3GA3
@stevebclarke @Russell05958081 @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Yes
@DannyJohnJules #CatAliticConverters Bah-dhum-tish, thank you very much, I'm here all week, enjoy your vegan 3D printed burgers. x
@Stephenphs @Rivian No, not 600 kWh, 200. But no one has actually confirmed that yet. I'm sure it's true but at the moment, a 150 kWh battery pack is the largest around. Not for long I'm sure.
@DannyJohnJules I wish I could walk that slow and cool sir.
@Stephenphs @Rivian You would probably be depressed to discover the vast majority of people who've commented say they like how it looks. I have no opinion either way.
@helenhgavin @FullyChargedShw Thank you so much Helen, we really appreciate it.
Well done Victoria, this is what all buildings of this size should be like, and all new buildings, even in the UK. https://t.co/NJwJ2Vm9hr
@QuestionMoreAus @DanielAndrewsMP @FullyChargedDan Fantastic. Although of course it should be normal now. It will be in a couple of years.
@motoxer913 @rwhd1931 @Rivian Yes, cleaner, but nowhere near clean. It's like saying 'clean coal.' Has about as much attachment to fact as 'free money.'
@GavinFree I feel it's the right thing to do sir. :-)
@rwhd1931 @motoxer913 @Rivian I'm not going to argue with you, but I will say there is no such thing now, there never has been and there never will be anything that resembles 'clean diesel.'
@mattbrown590 @Rivian Some people love it. I have zero opinion on how cars look. :-)
@mc_callum10 @ManMadeMoon @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert I'd guess at 2022 earliest deliveries, it's all guess work ATM. Sadly we have to wait but I think we'll get to test drive one this year. Woot!
@DJBurges @Voyager03 @Rivian I agree 100%. Most of the new models being released as manufacturers scramble to keep with Tesla and expensive, large, heavy machines. But I think we'll see a change in the next 18 month. Honda and VW are both launching small, 200 mile range, cheaper sensible EVs.
This episode has generated a lot of interest, with many references to what JLR should probably be doing more of. Clearly very popular, and the most likely startup to go into production, the @Rivian SUV and pickup truck. https://t.co/R1fChJ3s99
@ManMadeMoon @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert I think in this particular case you're fairly safe. Very experienced team behind it, healthy order book, actual manufacturing facility. If you get one will you give me a lift... up a random mountain.
Thank you, https://t.co/wSoMg5T6af
@jakeyc @Rivian We cover all manner of cars, and while the @Rivian is huge, the VW ID and (soon on Fully Charged) the Honda Urban EV are small, much cheaper with 200+ miles range. I think we'll see a lot more smaller, sensible, easy to park EV's coming in the next 2 years
@n111aow @FullyChargedDan @Rivian To charge 180 kWh battery from a 3kw outlet, OMG, let me think, you'd be adding around 5 miles range in an hour, so about 80 hours! :-)
@swiv2010 @Rivian If we're very lucky.
@MrSubsea @KevinSharpe59 @Rivian There are various battery options, the biggest is 180 kWh. So you can have that but it'll cost more. It's all explained in some detail in the video which I assume you haven't watched :-)
The @Rivian is hard not to love. Okay it is huge, but it goes from zero to 60 mph in 3 seconds,  it can have a 400 mile range, it is 100% electric and has loads of storage. Have a look: https://t.co/R1fChJ3s99
@the_oily_one @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert I'm sure they could, for enough ££. You need electric classic cars https://t.co/FBdae6YY4H
@dennis_p @bonnienorman @TeslaOwnersWW @arctechinc @business @TeslaMdAtlantic @FullyChargedShw How very tiresome, I've driven from UK to Italy on one trip, and to Sweden on another, using superchargers, it was a piece of easy digestible cake. I'll be doing Tesla road trip in Australia end of this month, will make an episode about it and refer to this nonsense
Just released. Some people are going to love this! The Rivian electric adventure vehicles. Electric 7 seater SUV, and crew cab pickup. And yes, they can tow up to 5 tons! https://t.co/R1fChJ3s99
@igoodyer @andersen_ev Yes, have re-tweeted
More into about JLR here. https://t.co/rIhVU5mF1Z
@_SmartUK Yes, very sad news and even more sadly, just the first sign. It's a global shift and no one company or country can control it. Our current technology is unsustainable, it will change whether we like it, agree with it or not.
@WardRuther I wish they thought that :-) No chance
@maddiemoate @BigLemonBusCoop Yes! Loved the  @BigLemonBusCoop  And of course they're on the (very long) list of things we want to do on @FullyChargedShw
I should be working but then I remembered this. Hans Teeuwen on Carpool. Haven't watched this in years, from 2011. He's very funny. https://t.co/Jvs3CJ6jFP
@Russell05958081 @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Don't worry, there will be a large selection of classic T shirts from early 70's fictional folk/rock fusion bands to the very latest styles for young hipsters. And ticket prices V similar
@sallepierrelamy I used to be a shoemaker, that was the first shoe I made for m myself (a long time ago)
@andylewisuk It is indeed, slightly embarrassing. When the video was played on 'Saturday Swap Shop' (I think) Thatcher was a guest. She said "I didn't like the song but the young man at the start was quite funny." Yay, Thatcher liked me....OMG. The shame.
@SamFrancesPitt @2di2d In my mind you are a cutting edge hipster, smoked tofu and mashed avocado eating, fixed wheel bike riding app developer from Hoxton
@2di2d @SamFrancesPitt It's a wonder I can still get around at my age! Now, where did I put my .... I can't remember what I'm looking for.
@2di2d @SamFrancesPitt Oh Bugger. Of course. Painfully obvious, I will walk away, head down, knuckles dragging... duuuuur
@SamFrancesPitt Very interesting, thanks for posting but I'm now going to admit something. I have no idea what ICYM stands for/means. I know I'm going to be further ashamed when/if you explain :-)
@GettinTwitta @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Okay, fair enough, we've had a respectable torrent of criticism and advice on how we should record audio, so all input useful.
@GettinTwitta @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert It's a pop shield, not a sound-reflecting surface but you knew that :-)
@martinsmpn @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Yes, good idea. The single most offensive thing any human being has done ever. Using a type of technology that you don't is nothing short of a capital crime :-)
@fullontwit @daviesdjandy80 @PinkyClarky @ECApaulreeve @FullyChargedDan @ECALive He or she was trying to put you off. If you put a deposit on a @Hyundai_UK electric Kona and then decide you don't want the car, they are not going to thumb their nose at you and keep the deposit.
@MONKEYMAG1C And cheaper new ones are coming, and the 2nd hand market is growing. More new cars also means more 2nd hand ones
@MONKEYMAG1C We will witness a serious ramp up of electric car production this year. Finally car manufacturers are realising there IS a demand.
It almost looks like something is changing https://t.co/Iq3c4uYZPL
I really don't want to harp on about it too much but the Fully Charged almanac 2020 we are publishing with @unbounders is now at 99%. (We're very happy to go way over 100% of course) More into here: https://t.co/wOMBd37Vby
There's a new 2019 news episode available on #fullychargedshow  in cased you're interested  https://t.co/umk5Rpx9Ly
@doubledutch13 @Patreon @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @YouTube Thank you. Very much appreciated and we are working hard not to disappoint.
@19user84 @GreenCarGuide @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @DriveElectricUK @GoUltraLow @OLEVgovuk @WTSNottingham @LukeRedfernEST I would humbly suggest that the respondents are interested in EV's and clean tech, only a small number actually own/drive electric cars but I agree, there's clearly some selection bias.
@helmi It's more for the design, the materials used and the ways it's engineered. However I lease a Kona so that says more I suppose. The Kona is very traditional in design but game changing in energy efficiency.
@KevinSharpe59 I know, so embarrassing but I worked it out! I'm very clever . . . . but slow :-)
@captain_flymo @ubitricity_uk @Arednel @Leglesszebra Can see this discussion is wide ranging and fascinating but just want to say when cars are plugged in the cable is locked at both ends. Yes, you could smash the charger with a sledge hammer, or cut through the wire with bolt cutters but there might be safety issues.
In this latest news update I make a fundamental and deeply offensive error, naming a car with a mildly incorrect term. Other than that, it's quite interesting #FullyCharged https://t.co/ROVHpiw3FM
@RichardDGNaylor Oh we’ve all been there. On 2nd thoughts I’ve never body slammed my wife. She’d probably break my jaw if I tried. Hope you’re both okay. LOL
@wurzie82 Oh yes, don't worry, it's going to take decades, but seriously, there is no such thing as a 'super efficient' petrol/diesel engine. At best 30% efficient which is frankly embarrassing. Rubbish electric motors are 85% efficient. new ones closer to 90%.
One thing I want to say about the HFC cars I've driven (all of them) They have complex and energy sapping filters to super clean the air before it goes into the fuel cell. How often do they need changing? I don't know.
@wurzie82 I'm increasingly confident that the era of the combustion engine is over. It'll take time but they are just too complex and inefficient.
@MikeBatt66 True that, I'm counting my blessings
I've glanced at my Twitter feed on occasion today and it's on fire with hydrogen V battery discussion. As always I agree with everyone. Important to remember their either is better than crude, Victorian era combustion engines.
What he said. https://t.co/CMYGEoYxC5
@SimonBa11 @ArianeSherine As long as we agree there's super elitist fanatics on both sides. The Leave mob tried to fob us off that they're just regular Joe's. Standing 'with the people.' It's such arrogant nonsense, and what about the 48% who know it's a shit idea. Do they just shut up?
What he said. People want electric cars, the manufacturers are holding back discreetly. They're got a lot of diesel models on their hands no one wants. Difficult transition https://t.co/5cHbDmfG6P
@SimonBa11 @ArianeSherine It was such a dodgy, ill conceived, panic ridden gesture with zero planning or solutions, pushed by a bunch of super elitist fanatics who lied loud and strong for years, so making the best of it is a miserable prospect. It won't solve any of the issues people voted for. Hey ho.
@ArianeSherine I mentioned busses in the thing I wrote, here's some more news on that. https://t.co/g9iBzBssMy
@SimonBa11 @ArianeSherine TBH I'm happy when I don't talk about it. I think we are seeing that the desire to 'make it work' is 100% unworkable. It's a terrible idea based on an extreme nationalist fantasy. It's based in the early 1900's and should stay there.
@SimonBa11 @ArianeSherine Not quite what I meant, but never mind :-)
@Paul_Denney @Robbie83Francis @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan Thank you. Yes, quite some change in 9 years
@ArianeSherine Make a mental note to ask him again in a few months. The only good thing about this unutterable mess is no one, genuinely no one in this country has a clue what's going to happen.
@marTW33T @Robbie83Francis @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan You are way too kind and yes, I seem to remember it took a long time. I was helped by my wonderful nephew who is a camera operator so that was useful.
@Rob_Mule It's true that a tiny demonstration by nationalist extremists took place, it's nothing to do with Greggs or vegan sausage rolls. I have posted 2 dozen corrections and retractions, pointless exercise.
@EdwardoBankio Not that it matters in the least but I have posted countless retractions and explanations about how the Greggs vegan sausage roll story is not true, but because of the way Twitter works few see that. Hey ho.
@Robbie83Francis @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan I started Fully Charged in 2010!! 9 years ago. Here's the first, very earnest and a bit rubbish episode. https://t.co/huWWDOcQuw
I'll say it again. I know the picture of the numpties outside Greggs was nothing to do with vegan sausage rolls. Okay. I truly know that. I made a very minor error. I know it was incorrect. I know. Okay. I genuinely know. Let's move on. :-)
@speedyedd76 Yes. He has a self cleaning micro filter system. Some dust is expelled from a grill around his recharge socket. :-)
@AlistairFrith Yes, I know that. Which is why I posted the retraction.
This is much more interesting. Jonny @Carpervert Smith at the LA motor show, and yes, the @Rivian will be featured big time in the next episode! Woot! https://t.co/lEWthvH96n
Here's the retraction I posted about the boring vegan sausage roll demo-non-story. I'm doing this to try and reduce the amount of comments on this pointless bit of passing detritus. https://t.co/xEGS5BjmTJ
@kathrynstimpson Sorry to respond that I already know. This is a failing of Twitter rather than any individual. I have already posted a retraction once I knew the real story but you didn't see that, you saw the 1st one that got a bigger reaction. Annoying but that's Twitter
Whatevs, this is much more interesting. A tour of electric gorgeousness at the LA motors  show with lovely @Carpervert  https://t.co/lEWthvH96n
Okay, so I, along with many, jumped to conclusions about the vegan sausage role fury notion. Nothing of the sort, just a few angry nationalists stopped by police near a Greggs. Of course they will hate vegan sausage rolls but that's just a side issue. :-)
@TheRealMike @Carpervert @GarethJonesTV @boggissimo @MCCTrials Oh yeah, I've done that in a Leaf, nightmare but I made it through :-)
@Carpervert @GarethJonesTV @boggissimo @MCCTrials I don't know what the Exeter trial is? Great that a Leaf has done it. Is it difficult?
@MrKilpingBanana Somehow it's fine to have a minimum wage, even though it's offensively low, but it's considered a brutal communist outrage to suggest a maximum wage, stifling innovation, strangling business etc. To which I respond bollocks. If you get $10 million a year, chip in matey.
A gentle stroll around the electric parts of the LA motor show with @Carpervert and it's not just cars https://t.co/lEWthvH96n
Breath of fresh air from over the pond https://t.co/JXNdCFLIGI
And mine! https://t.co/sdgSwtpVkE
@dirk1978 @darrenpjones @CommonsSTC I don't wish to boast but I have been there to give my twopenneth. TBH I was a bit rubbish but it was V interesting
@darrenpjones @CommonsSTC Close to a million battery electric cars sold in China last year, +200k battery electric busses, the big investment is there, but HFC tech is developing, perfect for large vehicles, ships, trains etc. Important question is always 'where does the hydrogen come from?'
@GrahamMillman @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert We hope tickets will be available mid February. That's the plan.
@DontBuy_A_Tesla @FullyChargedShw No, Patreon money only goes toward actually making shows. It's brutally ring fenced. We have to raise enough money in the USA to make the show work. Totally separate project.
@Carpervert @FullyChargedShw You are way too kind and an absolute delight to spend time with. Lets do loads more in 2019.  xx
Brilliant. https://t.co/LZNigEIwZc
This is quite simply brilliant. https://t.co/gGsJWYqCPc
@richardlpbtn @YouTube @FullyChargedDan Love it, have got in touch. Many thanks Richard
@EVWantToBe @FullyChargedDan @JamieIT @SilverstoneUK @BMWi @MINI @VolvoCarUK @AudiUK @PorscheGB @KiaUK @Hyundai_UK @NissanElectric @MercedesBenz @UKVolkswagen Yes, we'll certainly try, bandwidth at Silverstone is a problem but I'd love to live stream the talks.
Just want to say a big Happy New Year to all our amazing, loyal, funny, inquisitive and challenging #FullyChargedShow viewers and supporters. I think next year is going to be very interesting, look forward to seeing you all in 2019. There's lots of FullyCharged-ness planned
This kind of sums up my 2018. Taken at the end of the Paris Motor Show. #knackered https://t.co/2jkS2boedl
@JamieIT @FullyChargedDan @SilverstoneUK @BMWi @MINI @VolvoCarUK @AudiUK @PorscheGB @KiaUK @Hyundai_UK @NissanElectric @MercedesBenz @UKVolkswagen We have definitely got auditoriums sorted, much easier to hear. A bit of screaming combustion possible but not definite, much more room, test drives, more cars, more everything. Especially more food
@AgSilver47 Oooh, yes and no. I think I have filmed at their site back in the old TV days, but thanks for the link, very very interesting
@Paul_Denney That is nothing short of hyper-spooky. My daughter is doing her final history dissertation on this very event. We've been interviewing locals who went up the hill and bashed up Nazis.  It's an amazing story.
Brilliant. https://t.co/KX5LfwGzUO
@Carpervert No, I've not heard anything about it, I'm so surprised, I'd have thought my timeline would be bulging with comments about how it's faked etc, because people know, they can tell, they're really clever.
@golfgtedriver I'd suggest you are very lucky unless it's a stolen one, in which case, as the tracking software is legendary it's probably not a good idea.  Good luck!
@Stucashx @Carpervert Seriously;y, this is around the 7,000th time I've been sent this link. It's been around for ages
@jakejustme76 We have bacon in the house at the moment because my son's been staying and he loves a bit of bacon. I seriously have no interest any more. It's weird. So no.
@jack_rix @Carpervert FYI https://t.co/JXDHzmBYem  (Very low/variable quality but it's all about 'the content' yeah)
@Micromuc @EV_TQs @FullyChargedShw We're very aware of the amazing work she is doing and hope to feature her on the show in 2019
@BenSullins Nice idea :-)
@trytohelpyou1 I am sooooooo not interested in him. It was a massive error to mention him. I have now deleted the original Tweet because it made me sound as if I'm the slightest bit interested in anything he's ever said. mI'm not.
@DawgUK I've already posted a retraction and I'm soooooo bored of the old Canadian bloke
@Ronniesoak Stick to having totally unfounded opinions about someone you have never met. You are good at that. LOL
Just been for long walk in fresh air and now deeply regret saying anything about Peterson. Not interested and new years resolution is to never mention him again on the Twitters. Case closed.
@silky666 Oh Silky ...silky silky silky.  Try and be more patronising.   Oh, you can't, you've reached maximum pomposity and supposed knowingness.  He's adored by young fascists and is a climate change denying bore.   Other than  that, he's lovely
@locoloic Could it be that the long term consequences are that men have less control over women, which we've been used to for the last 5 or so thousand years and that's upsetting, if you're a man who likes control over women? Seriously asking.
@JordeeGee I agree, I've heard him speak on many topics, he makes many interesting arguments, some batshit crazy ones and he's utterly adored by a tiny minority of very unpleasant young white, angry males, particularly in the USA. Why is that?
@davidunola504 Oh, so the other stuff is fine? He's a 'rabid, woman hating toss bag' That's okay? Just not a white supremacist, even though the gaggle of angry young 'it's all someone else fault' little white boys adore and worship his every misogynist utterance.
@nona80_swanette @DrAndrewThaler Oh yes, we've always shared a similar % of knuckle draggers in both countries :-) Check @ivebeeniced for plenty of examples
@Jess_Stevenson @CraigCRogers @craig0023 @gilescoren @BBCRadio2 Have a look at this. Tesla range, less than half the price. https://t.co/TRuBx78XUc
@JazVock @gilescoren @BBCRadio2 Well done sir, a most original and cutting criticism that will shake the confidence of the worlds millions of electric motorists to the core. And then they'll carry on driving far better technology than the Victorian age clunkers you clearly admire. Massive LOL
@gilescoren @BBCRadio2 You could mention electric cars and the fact that 2019 is set to be a historic year for them. The BBC have, for some unfathomable reason a fairly long standing negative attitude toward them, so you know, might be fun.
I suppose it's really not surprising that I've had this event retweeted at me many hundreds of times now, it's had 13,300 RTs so far, and over 29,000 likes, so clearly it's popular. I give up. Here it is. https://t.co/XbOUl5U2qx
@NathanAdamsTog That's very kind of you, I hadn't heard about it :-)
@JacobFrostholm As I'm sure you can imagine, comments like yours are profoundly helpful :-)
@Hammerman99 Believe me I stripped down everything, checked the socket circuit, changed the fuse, it's the sealed 'safety unit' that seems to be at fault, slightly beyond my bodging abilities.
Just in case you missed this before Christmas and you're in a state of Crimbo-Limbo, have a look at this. https://t.co/LR0JSmDlCf
@rangers1873 That's the problem, it does have a safety switch which won't go 'click' like it's meant to. Have used the machine many times, it's always worked fine in the past.
We are now taking turns doing slippy walking with old towels on our feet to polish the floor. It's a great workout and post Christmas  calorie burner.
Here's what's bugging me at the mo. We hired a floor polisher, splashed a load of traffic wax on the floor, plugged in said polisher and it doesn't work. Hire company closed until 2nd Jan. Result. Deep sadness
@MrPeterRichmond Does anyone really care?
10 days on and it still continues. I know it's not surprising because of #FullyCharged and clearly many, many people assume I haven't seen the video of the woman trying to put petrol into a Tesla. Truly, I have seen it, 10 days ago.
@jeremyeharris @FullyChargedShw I certainly know a great deal about greenwashing, and compliance cars. I don't think that's what VW are doing, and while I'm still angry about the whole #dieselgate debacle I also know just about every other manufacturer did exactly the same, but got away with it.
@pjuster @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Lots more with @maddiemoate in 2019, we're really keen to make more eps with her, she's the best.
Wow, very cool https://t.co/9FQIdSUTZB
@DarranShepherd @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Yes, coming on a brand new website in 2019. Much mercy including Faraday Past collection.
@WingBoomF1 We will announce ticket sales in early 2019, as in we'll be shouting from rooftops etc.
Christmas Special 2018, now on #FullyCharged with myself and @Carpervert  And someone wins a very cool prize, thanks to @RolecEV and @DriveElectricUK  https://t.co/pkjJRxZs6i
Someone’s going to get a nice surprise today at 2pm when the #fullychargedshow Christmas special is released.
@willbank @FullyChargedShw If you look at the entirety of the output from #FullyCharged I don't think VW get particularly 'loyal' treatment. I normally get accused of being a Tesla fanboy. I think what VW are doing now is important, without forgetting what they have done.
@KieronSmith6 Hi Kieron, and Happy Christmas, great to hear from you. Hope everything is going well.
@Rob_Mule In South Africa? I didn't see one. I'm sure there are some.
@dpeilow @FullyChargedDan We really should start to do those clever translation subtitle things shouldn't we David :-) But thanks for going to the bother.
@WORMSStweet @FullyChargedDan It does.
@FullyChargedDan (It's just passed 101,852)
@chrisridd I think it was a bit of both, the MEB platform will be in all future VW electric vehicles, from small to big, but the ID is a complete package so also the actual car.
@JeremyJHardy Hope you are recovering well Jeremy, good to hear you are okay.
@bradkieser I noticed a surprising lack of rooftop solar, particularly in a country where they would make a massive, economically beneficial impact.
@Kyyanno I think we can be confident we will.
I never thought I'd drive an electric car along a beautiful coast road in South Africa, even more encouraging is the fact that the car is a VW, 100% electric and very impressive. https://t.co/LR0JSmDlCf
@dave25804417 Yes, batteries have thermal management and I don't know about USA, however if it's a popular car would make sense to supply them to America.
@WhereismyDipp @aaronsporter03 I think they will. Not that I know anything of course :-)
@thomtom1 Seriously, so if Hyundai, Tesla, BMW, Nissan or Honda let us drive an early development model and wouldn't let us film the interior, would you feel the same?
@EVNewsDaily @SnellingDean @Poxenium @Motor1com Increasing regen is done through the gear selector, which we couldn't show, which is quite similar to the BMW i3 system. Very easy to access.
@Mr2_2012 No and no, body is steel, they are doing all they can to produce an 'economic vehicle.' We will find out a lot more in 2019.
Rear wheel drive, incredible turning circle and so many other things we can't show yet. The VW ID electric car is coming. Here's a first look. https://t.co/LR0JSmDlCf
A very interesting development in the world of electric cars. The mass market (cheaper) 200-300 mile electric car. The VW ID first drive, on #FullyCharged  https://t.co/LR0JSmDlCf
@PloughboyBris @FullyChargedShw @VolkswagenSA Only for 24 hours, free in a bit.
There are 2 more episodes of #FullyCharged to come before Christmas day, tomorrow is quite special, the VW ID sneaky test drive, and on Christmas eve the Christmas special with a prize draw, actual, impressive prizes will be won!
@_SmartUK I think you will see some changes in the coming few years, the option to buy your electricity directly from solar and wind farms at reduced rates. We'll be discovering m ore on #FullyCharged in 2019
@jakejustme76 Theres been plenty of other 'carpool' type shows, however I suppose I was there first. Not that it means anything :-)
What he said. It[s economics baby. https://t.co/X71xZKuS6c
I have been sent the 'Woman trying to put gas (petrol) in a Tesla" so many times recently, it is kind of funny, also a bit cruel, if it's not a setup it's fascinating that someone could drive a Tesla and not think it's a bit different to a regular old fashioned car.
@antherricheen @silky666 I am fascinated and indeed thrilled that you can follow me and support Donald. Humanity is many faceted and complex and I love that. Thank you
@GadgetGav Good point well made, I would never dream of clicking through to her drivel so no personal risk there :-) However due to the fact it may encourage others to do so I have deleted the tweet.
@silky666 I don't quite understand. I'm constantly tweeting very non political things. I hold back for 95% of the time on more contentious issues.
Ba-doom-tish, thank you very much, Im here all week https://t.co/tcGTiNcNsm
Final news update for 2018. #fullychargedshow https://t.co/HX0G9xCBeA
@jojusolar @SunPower @MyEnergiLTD It's a perfect copy!
A bit of EV and clean transport related news before the Christmas shenanigans, courtesy of #fullychargedshow  https://t.co/HX0G9xCBeA
@RedQuasar42 @DannyJohnJules @CCfunkandsoul @normanlovett1 A most Happy Christmas to the Taskmaster. I hope that will suffice sir.
Hyundai Kona, Maersk and a Plane Called Alice. Final #FullyCharged news update for 2018. https://t.co/HX0G9xCBeA
Decided to kick the whole eco car thing. This is my new ride. 4.5 mpg baby. https://t.co/y7ICTZaEX4
Well I never, who would have thought economics would have anything to do with it. Surely solar panels are just for eco posers with no grasp of reality. Bye bye coal... bye bye. https://t.co/3mgL4vJUes
What she said. https://t.co/nBrKkHhZi5
@GChaustow No, your video was a first for me, heartbreaking but sadly quite amusing.
@DigitDisco @IronMillHydro @Costingtheearth @PeterGWeather You post that initial tweet and you expect me to take anything you say, concoct and misconstrue and you expect to be taken seriously? Electric cars won't strain the grid, they are a positive benefit, electric cars are very safe and don't 'burst into flames randomly.'
@balafre7 I was impressed, particularly because it's still in development. The episode about it is nearing completion. On Fully Charged. (It's not there yet) https://t.co/rlBaoYNKL6
@jacquicottrell Oh really, so they've once again done the research. Marvellous. Utter nonsense of course but it makes a shallow, throw away talking point while continuing to support the very environmentally aware oil companies. Good job BBC
@DigitDisco @IronMillHydro @Costingtheearth @PeterGWeather Not that tired old pile of misleading trash again. Yawn. Seen it too many times. Based on pure, unadulterated FUD.
@balafre7 No, it's a VW. https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@sustainableish I guess you could take a peek at #FullyCharged  https://t.co/rlBaoYNKL6 Quite a lot of info on there, and also https://t.co/KsxVERkI5V
@andypoulton @AwardsDarwin @MotoNutJob @Carpervert Oh my God, that is almost unbearably cruel, and staggering, and cruel again but at least they helped her out in the end.
@WinAnEV If Dyson actually produce a production car with solid state batteries, that will be the tech news of the decade. I've heard rumours, nothing more, and I've spoken to many who really know what's happening in battery-land.
@PoindexterMk1 I think we are talking at 100% cross purposes here. Your initial tweet suggested I was 'plugging cars.' I have never and will never 'plug cars.' I test drive them and say what I think from a very basic consumer level. I have no vested interest in any automotive company
@WinAnEV I've got a sneaky feeling VW are very aware at how fast battery technology is developing. I haven't heard anything concrete but they are very confident they've got something special to offer.
@aalso67 Yes, #fullychargedshow episode coming soon and more details here: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@TomBarnardPR @theseoldcars @CarGurusUK @CarGurus @GM @Carpervert I never knew you attended the launch of the EV1. Minor historical moment. Would love to hear more.
@JoostVanWell @PoindexterMk1 Great graphic and I agree BTW
@daveayerst It's a VW. More info here: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@JoostVanWell @PoindexterMk1 You are too kind but yes, I agree, that is exactly what we're trying to do. We are planning of broadening the topics we cover, bikes, trucks, boats, planes as well as cars in 2019
@Mozz1camera You have missed a torrent of my tweets yesterday :-) It's a VW, episode coming soon on #fullychargedshow but a blog explaining more here. https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@PoindexterMk1 A fascinating tweet. Yes, there's already loads of of independent car analysis going on, but a) is it any good and more importantly b) created by people who know anything about electric cars? So what am I good at?
@JohnEG78 @FullyChargedShw Yes, very confident it isn't
@PaulVealsReal @Carpervert Yes, I can confirm that. VW ID is rear wheel drive.
@timleavy @Quinrooboy @FullyChargedShw Wow, okay, well, no one is going to buy that. Blimey cars are ridiculously expensive to buy. (I lease mine)
@timleavy @Quinrooboy @FullyChargedShw The VW diesel Golf is currently £22.150 as listed on VW's site, so hopefully closer to that
@LukaFinzgar We are still ignorant about a huge amount, VW still cagey but clearly it's bristling with sensors. Over the course of 2019 we'll learn a great deal more.
@Quinrooboy It will be 'the same price as a diesel Golf' according to official VW spokesman. more details coming soon on the episode and right now on this blog. https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
I have had to explain the distracting look of yet to be released vehicles numerous times today. We get JLR cars driving past us regularly looking like this. It's not a paint job, it's a vinyl wrap to cover details. https://t.co/yOncBqemPa
We are working on the FullyCharged episode about the VW ID first drive, but here's a blog post about it for the time being. https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD https://t.co/cMVQrbk08C
@TuomasSauliala I'd guess there will be, eventually, 4WD, GT versions of the ID, but not for a while. They are totally focussed on getting a mass market, affordable version out big time first
@craig0023 @bundy331 @saki_tokyojapan We are very likely to test, okay we are testing early next year. Not 100% out yet as far as I know.
@DeeJ722 All info on range (yes, you can get one that does close to 300 miles) on blog: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@WarrenCarrigan Okay, well I can't argue with that :-)
@Voyager03 Ride is excellent and this is a test vehicle so many things will change. More info: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@pfierens No, although the episode about the Sion is coming early 2019. This is the VW ID. More info here: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@DCMonkey81 @ColesRachel No info on deposits date yet, I'd say mid 2019 or earlier.
@DeeJ722 It's all on the blog post: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@AyrshireStew Yes, very realistic. They have put serious money into the MEB platform that's under this car. €42 billion on battery procurement. That's quite a lot of battery. Yes, they are very serious. More info on blog: https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@WarrenCarrigan Just to gently explain. 'Volkswagen' is German for 'Peoples Car.'
Here's a short blog with a bit more info about the VW ID test drive exclusive. https://t.co/mPWwMddaSD
@juanincognito It's very standard covering to keep the design details covered until the official unveil.
@mawk_au No, VW
@LiamEdwards85 Yes
@Rossco65 Yes, review and blog coming today
@Sussexsaint72 We were allowed to film it, we can release the episode today, so yes, we're allowed
It's a people's car, super efficient, very nice drive, incredibly roomy interior, coming in 2020 https://t.co/JyvCyoGLCs
In the classic #FullyCharged tradition, we haven't quite got the episode about the car I drove in. Blogpost coming soon, episode coming soon after. Pic shows very old man and very very new VW ID https://t.co/9lBql3nrFx
Just thinking through the broken political sludge pit we’re in at the moment in the UK. We currently have the most divided, crackpot party just about in power, and literally no opposition. Labour should be leading all polls but are trailing hopelessly. I wonder why?
@dannycrm @The_PlugSeeker @DannyJohnJules Okay, that was bike related but true, Danny and Petula and kids also appear in this. https://t.co/k9fR7ifflK
@The_PlugSeeker @DannyJohnJules He's done a bit already and we've got plans for 2019 This is from way back in 2014, so production values a little shabby. https://t.co/Vw21FqFVmi
@evexplain @nickshanks @Honda @VW But there will be a smattering of info on #FullyChargedShow very soon
@Nufkin @dpeilow We will reveal all asap.
Just another #fullychargedshow shoot, for some kind of special episode. Easter? Midsummer solstice? Thanksgiving?  Something like that. https://t.co/Junq31MQB3
@MarekBidwell @DrGaryFuller Once again, an utterly rubbish, totally fatuous 'study' based on a gross misunderstanding of the technology
@ED_SOLACE Less than zero success in that department so far sir. Mr Barrie won't even stand near my Tesla, he claims it is the work of the devil.
Today we're recording our #FullyCharged Christmas Special, highlights, laughs and jollity from 2018, and looking forward to what's to come next year. And a prize draw, and other festive shizzle. Coming very soon.
@RobertOsfield Had multiple comments such as this. Very ardent defence of European farming practices. No mention yet of intensive pig, chicken farming and the crop use to feed them. But cows in nice fields. Lovely.
Heavens to betsy some people get so angry about the mildest, not preachy casual discussion about meat. Quite fun though. https://t.co/XTVkwXsn31
@AdrianHiel Wow, so much for VW;s strictly enforced embargo. :-)
Early heads up for a small #FullyCharged episode about burgers and meat and sustainability that's clearly annoyed some. The comments are lively. The burgers were lovely. https://t.co/XTVkwXsn31
Nom Nom Nom A bit of an extra episode of #FullyCharged with @Carpervert and myself gorging on delish veggie burgers. https://t.co/XTVkwXsn31
@Carpervert Damn, you guessed!
@MyEnergiLTD @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @fi_saunders @octopus_energy @power_evergreen @EVDriverUK @She_sElectric @BethLilyRace @KateFantom Cruel but true ☺️
I can’t tweet any pictures yet but I’ve been driving something that I truly believe will be a common sight on our roads in 2020.
Interesting https://t.co/Byybx0Nt2V
Sunset over the cape. https://t.co/Kb1lyka5Tc
@Herring1967 I have enormous confidence in you Richard.
It’s quite nice being warm. #SouthAfrica https://t.co/qr9imP8ff3
@birdingbilly We will discover soon but guessing yes, much less than that.
@executiverocker Yes, doing a minor seeth but then it is the Daily Mail, and the public charging infrastructure is woeful in places. But mainly standard levels of ignorance back by reactionary publication read by angry people.
We are in Cape Town, South Africa to see/drive an electric car that we can't tell you about until next week. Important? Yes, game changing? Possibly. A big manufacturer who can produce the numbers required so there isn't a 2 year waiting list? Yes.
It's a daily struggle not to say anything about the effing 'B' word, but every now and then something jumps out that is sound profoundly insane it bursts out. So apologies but just read that some Tory twat said "The Irish really should know their place." https://t.co/pjXv0TmWvI
@postbus88 I thoroughly approve
@andyleaflinux @DanielSneeUK What he said

Oh, okay, I’ll buy one. https://t.co/Dp5JZvxsMg
This is one of the most important developments that have come about helped by development of electric cars, renewable tech and the internet https://t.co/pIpG9Vmr9H
@DontBuy_A_Tesla @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @Tesla I have no idea what you're on about. What is there to agree or disagree about. I made the error of scanning your twitter feed. Let's just accept that we disagree about pretty much everything and move on.
@DontBuy_A_Tesla @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @Tesla Well, I have now, but seeing as your twitter handle is  "Don't buy a Tesla' I assume you have some kind of issue with them. I mean, some people use their name, I know, archaic. Much better to use a demand.
@DontBuy_A_Tesla @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @Tesla I didn't know we were meant to talk about it. I don't know what's misleading, but clearly you think we're in cahoots with Tesla to deliberately mislead the general public . . or something. Mystified
A most impressive confectionary creation sir. https://t.co/M5iVrA76E2

In case you missed the latest episode of #FullyCharged show, here is an update on the availability and pricing of the Tesla Model 3 https://t.co/8Sk9CSoJmn
Thank you, much appreciated. Check this @InkSharkman @HeinzJunkins @Carpervert https://t.co/5z33fXp7NA
@SilkeCo Yes, you can transfer 10MW energy in 5 minutes, but then you waste 8.5 MW as heat and toxic gas as you drive along in dated, 19th century technology.
@The_Dr_Clint As far as I understand the showroom is open to anyone interested, reservation holders were first to be invited.
@MJPrior_ @FullyChargedShw Yes, I thin k insurance for EV's is one of the big elephants in the room. Good call. It's on the list
@evcarmike In Europe, cars in their thousands
@j_macca7 @FullyChargedShw We should have made much more of the fact that the Model 3 on display, and the first cars to be delivered are expensive. They will follow that up with a cheaper Model 3 but I predict it won't be 'cheap.'
@RichieClem99 No, there were just looking at the car. ~They ordered it 2 years ago and they'd never seen one.
@edwardgpease @solar_chase I've had panels for 10 years and I've never had anything between the panels and the roof. Not even a mouse, and we are surrounded by multiple breeds of wildlife.
It looks like it's coming to the UK in 2019, but the rest of Europe are getting the #teslamodel3 in February. Jonny Smith and I had a look. https://t.co/B4bGzco2d8
@leedsbee I don't totally disagree with you, but let's be frank, nuclear has a couple of consequences too. Not in the generation, incredible safety record, but the waste management, a bit expensive, a bit long term, no real solution in sight. And of course there's batteries.
Jonny Smith and I had a quick look around the Tesla Model 3 in London, the European version is arriving in a couple of months, the UK version might get here by mid 2019 https://t.co/8Sk9CSoJmn
@WORMSStweet @EVNewsDaily @Tesla Mine charged on off peak power last night. The little spike this morning was tumble dryer. #powerwall https://t.co/CAHRTc69sn
@andiih @nickg_uk @Tesla @elonmusk We will shortly be releasing a video of the Tesla Model 3 on #FullyCharged, to Patreon supporters 1st, anyone can see it tomorrow eve. Full breakdown of specs, range, cost... but no news as to when in the UK. This year.
@SmartSysTom @poblgroup We are already following this brilliant project on #FullyCharged Initial video done, we're going back next your to see the finished project.
@hugh6210 I would argue that with new and much cheaper tech (panels, inverters batteries etc) plus super efficient building envelope should both be mandatory.
@FreVanOverloop You never need to say sorry, and my house, for example, has suitable east west roof areas, both however shaded by trees. My south facing roof not shaded, so really depends on location
@sambeaujones No with adequate, modern insulation, no.
And yes, ERast is a totally new direction
Very good points about ERast/West arrays, which work very well depending on location/trees/other buildings. Yes, they could all be part of a single array https://t.co/Q9l4YE42It
Brilliant job https://t.co/ULKhAqlcCc
@swaldman @quixoticgeek Sorry, yes, forgot to mention that
Judging from comments I am not alone in thinking all new builds should be constructed with a south facing mono-pitch roof and around 10 kilowatts of solar built into the roof, not slapped on top. A simple regulation that adds minimum build expense
What a wonderful sight. At least one developer has a brain https://t.co/xtrFLisj08
@techp0sion I was very clear in all tweets and reports that it was a LHD car, it's not RHD, they won't arrive until mid -late 2019 at the soonest as far as I understand.
@modjo1978 @lens300 @WHYTE_631 A classic comment, the like of which I haven't seen in a while. It's very funny, not original, and the fact you are happy to drive a diesel and let other people breath the carcinogenic filth pumping out of it is fine. You carry on sunshine
To answer some questions about Tesla Model 3 Anyone can go and see it. Next to Park Royal tube.  No UK price yet Only premium models available at start.  No dashboard. All controls on screen.  Should be RHD UK specific models by ‘mid 2019’ Detailed report on #FullyCharged soon
@GettinTwitta Left hand drive. We won’t get RHD until mid 2019
@TheEVside @The_PlugSeeker The Park Royal branch. On the A40. No queues when I was there.
@ukgadgetguy All they would say is mid 2019.
Tesla Model 3 in London https://t.co/FRxyH7xPre
@alexfenlon Yes. Next to Park Royal tube
You’ve probably seen it before but this is a Tesla Model 3 in London. https://t.co/HNlFDcKsxD
Currently at the Park Royal #Tesla showroom to see one of the first Tesla Model 3 cars in the UK. https://t.co/bkkmEcXsl9
Good to see Mr Charles adopting electric vehicles. https://t.co/mOdTrwvV8i
@bigiancun @Bam75Barry @FullyChargedDan @ManMadeMoon @DavidHsearch @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @elonmusk @James_BG @CarolineLucas @mrjamesob @GabbyLogan Such a typical, unthought response, "hydrogen fuel cells" are the fix for everything. Really? Yeah, sure, whatevs, easy, simple. Boom. Make cars look like they did when I was a kid and problem solved. Boom. LOL
@j_brorsson I consider everything I do in terms of the fuel use, waste, lack of sustainability and the long term consequences of my actions. Yes, I do fly way too much, it's a very first world problem to be privileged enough to worry about. I've never said I am 'green.'
Another cracking episode of #FullyCharged with Jonny @Carpervert Smith and the Kia e-Niro electric car. https://t.co/uxePusZj8P
@missrenge Merely for reference :-) https://t.co/o6GSN7G7fP
@NathRNath Well, either that ridiculous, stroppy reaction, or we could forget the whole sorry mess and start actually making life better for more people, you know, have a government that does some actual useful work. Just an idea
The government is in contempt of Parliament. Doesn't sound good does it. The current bunch have just lost a crucial vote.  #Brexshitshambles
@ConradAllum @Carpervert @Gocycle I've just replied! Very unusual for me :-)
@Maccers16 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @KiaUK I can honestly say I don't know what's going on, other than the car, officially announced today, won't be available until mid 2019.
But today, freshly released, lovely review of another possible game changers, the Kia e-Niro electric car with a 282 mile range. Nice https://t.co/uxePusZj8P
Mild heads-up.  Tomorrow morning I'll be doing some live Instagram and Periscope twiddling at a bit of an event. I'll post some reminders later. Could be quite interesting, and we'll be shooting proper stuff for #FullyCharged.
@CannavarUK And over 5 years, costs a fraction to drive same distance. Not just electricity/fuel. Most important is servicing. About 90% less cost. Manufacturers can flog ICE cars cheap because they make money in endless servicing and parts.
@mcmillan @The_WriteReads @buttercupreview I am trying to do an audiobook but I just haven't had time. I'm going to try and do it over Christmas/New Year period when it goes a bit quieter. I hope.
Well done guys! Enjoy your nuts. https://t.co/pXABqj7Cww
@EliotHiggins I'm most profoundly offended! He looks like a much earlier and cruder version with limited cleaning abilities.
@weezmgk No, he's doing the PR for the E-Niro so I suspect he's quite happy with arrangements ($$$)
Breaking News!  And it's on #FullyCharged  The Kia E-Niro, 100% electric, and I'm going to ask a journalistic question. Better than the Hyundai Kona? https://t.co/uxePusZj8P
@FiNutbrown @The_WriteReads @buttercupreview Let me help you :-)  https://t.co/o6GSN7G7fP
@HibbsA Good call. We’ve been planning this exact subject
@im_sam_carter @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Wow. Harsh. 😐
@jakejustme76 I'm sorry, I'm being thick as usual :-)
@jakejustme76 Have you watched the video?
Trees, paper and digital footprints, and the #FullyCharged Almanac 2020 https://t.co/FcYDnTIdOt
@tillathenun Oh Lord, my sincere apologies. It was a rather rash promise, there's still 394 names to call out, but I've just moved yours to the top of the list, don't tell anyone :-)
@eleonorasfalcon @Rich_Haywood @dannycrm I'm loving all your excuses, the fact that your husband starts the car on a frosty morning, burning expensive fuel to thaw it out. Priceless, okay, and massively wasteful, pumping out toxic fumes into the crisp morning air, but still, priceless.
@eleonorasfalcon @dannycrm Ah yes, the delightful, now very dated and expensive electric UP. Sorry, don't buy an electric car yet, I know that in a year you may change your mind. You're lucky, not an early adopter like me, you'll just reap the benefits
@eleonorasfalcon That's fine. Please don't be interested. But just so you know, 2nd hand EV values increasing, they last longer than petrol already, need far less servicing, are much cheaper to run and far more reliable, and 3 models coming in the next year are sub £20k
Even if you've never watched #FullyCharged and you're not interested in Electric Cars, this is a gorgeous looking episode as well as being informative of how things have changed. https://t.co/TRuBx78XUc
@StubCrouch Sort of implying if the last remnants of the car industry disappear from the UK, it's fine?
Woot! And thank you! https://t.co/u1F2UENUr8
@adrianbonet @ManMadeMoon In case you haven't seen it, there is this, but also we would love to get Duncan on #FullyCharged. Plans are afoot! https://t.co/1KCJWTD02V

@whitnashwizard @Jimmy_deVille The only problem with this very tired old cartoon is that it's fundamentally, and drastically wrong. It's nonsense, it says nothing remotely accurate or amusing.
This you have to see for 2 reasons. One, it is incredible, and 2, the commentary is typically understated American exuberance. Brilliant. https://t.co/7KE5Wlmojl
@dirk1978 Very much so, I'm answering this as my Kona is charging. Using a 50kw rapid charger you add about 180 miles range in 1 hour. If you can charge when you're not using the car in Cornwall, all the better but there's plenty of rapid chargers around  https://t.co/oTwsiNO0JP
@paulie_paulie Generally, counter to the popular narrative, the batteries are very robust. I say this from experience, from having driven 100's of 1,000's of miles in electric cars.
I'm currently driving around in a Hyundai Kona, and Jonny is right, it's an amazing electric car. #FullyCharged  https://t.co/TRuBx78XUc
The first episode of #FullyCharged with a question in the title, will it become a regular feature. Hyundai Kona, a Game Changer? https://t.co/TRuBx78XUc
@KiwiEV @Carpervert I'm not a Hyundai shill, but seriously, this is not a compliance car. They are just overwhelmed with the demand for them. They have ramped up production big time
IS the Hyundai Kona EV be the game changers many are saying. Jonny @Carpervert Smith drives 1,200 miles in one to find out. https://t.co/TRuBx78XUc
And this: https://t.co/AOVuQvH4yw
I’m soon about to talk about the future of car parks at the architecture offices of my very good friend Christophe at @Egretwest  I have to say I never imagined I could get excited about car parks but it is possible https://t.co/euqFWhpsWl
Apologise for not doing a proper #Periscope from the #Zappi launch but we’re doing a full explanatory episode about the brilliant new Zappi range on FullyCharged next year. Bit of a busy day.
@maxsec @FullyChargedShw @Patreon That review is coming next.
Will post another Periscope in a while.
#Zappi launch https://t.co/vg8oeIT4TQ
I’ll do a #periscope session in a bit so you can see the new model
In case you don’t know about Zappi we did a show about it a while back. Zappi smart EV charger | Fully Charged https://t.co/4futLNXisv   We’re now about to see the new version. Can’t wait. Such a brilliant system.
Very excited to be up here seeing the launch of the new Zappi charger from @MyEnergiLTD https://t.co/sQj0fPC5C5
Okay, yes you have a point https://t.co/dtQ8nG8scg
@edmoore Major congratulations sir. Very well deserved
@otterylexa @FullyChargedDan @Patreon Sorry about this, I am in touch with Patreon about the problem
Oooh, I hope Jonny @Carpervert Smith had a walk around that fella. https://t.co/CTPLngqiko
I’ve already started writing the #FullyCharged Almanac 2020, but far more importantly so are some genuinely clever people with qualifications who know what they are talking about. It’s going to be very impressive https://t.co/wOMBd37Vby

@afc_king Haven't heard that in a while, I have been pondering a mild mannered rant. I have a new title, 'Radical Centrist.' What d'you think?

@CleanAirSheff @FullyChargedShw @teslabjorn Totally agree
Oooh, that's very nice, thanks for sending. https://t.co/np4Ad7ppWr
@KchargeU We will be announcing that soon. We're closing the survey tomorrow evening, can't really pick a winner out of the hat before that.
Last chance to take part in the #FullyCharged survey. Check out the FAQ's and the explanation about the survey here: https://t.co/iNIalIrzc3
@omerdon @FullyChargedShw Monday or Tuesday this week, and it's a great review of a great car
A fabulous jumper creation. Happy Gazpacho Soup Day indeed! https://t.co/1adaqg3u5a
@rustyshacke @Carpervert I believe he was paid for that, a one-off event. I can see the fact that Jonny and I earn part of our living from hosting events for different companies really annoys you, there's nothing I can say other than don't watch anything we do.
A lovely trailer for half a dozen new episodes of #FullyCharged coming soon. https://t.co/yrsT5xog8J
@rustyshacke Okay, so here's a few things. 1, @Carpervert doesn't drive a Jag, of any sort, 2, he goes around factories all over the world, 3, he isn't paid by Jaguar and 4, if anything he raves about the Hyundai Kona with more enthusiasm on the next Fully Charged episode.
@rustyshacke Forgive me for being confused. You sent a link to a 5th Gear piece about the Jaguar I-PACE. Are you saying Jonny is a paid Jaguar spokesman? If so, not true and out of 400+ episodes, we've made a few mistakes but we try to rectify.
@timkirkfx Without wishing to come across pushy and overly proud, Fully Charged is, for want of a better descriptive term, a TV show. Watched all over the world, back catalogue always available, no commissioning editor tom placate.
@dannycrm The Kona review is coming early next week. 'Very early' is the quote I've been given.
Jolly japes, bladder anxiety and sunny weather, the #fullychargedshow multi car and boat test Euro road trip. Here's the trailer. https://t.co/yrsT5xog8J

@WiebeWkkr @TrickyDickyChap This is an excellent bit of twitter confusion, no, I don’t have a Tesla in Australia. However, I’ll be there in February next year for big family event. Will you still be there then?
For the people who took a bit of umbrage about the #FullyCharged survey, the FAQ's on this page, which we didn't remember to include in the links under the YouTube video (duuuur) explain a lot: https://t.co/iNIalIrzc3
@TrickyDickyChap You spotted the most spotted 'assume that's Robert's car' in the country.  It's not mine, mine is black, a bit muddy with a very mundane numberplate. Sorry.
@Paul_Denney That's very good advice... from a proudly British man who'll no doubt create a game changing electric car, developed in the UK . . . and built in Singapore. The LOLz keep rolling in :-)
@Carpervert @JoodyClarke @FullyChargedDan @teamuniti @SilverstoneUK @DavidHsearch @FullyChargedShw @ManMadeMoon @keith__johnston @LNeckermann @sidatkins @EVNewsDaily @Nickishields @MicrolinoWorld Me too too. We must make it so. @MicrolinoWorld
@ManMadeMoon @FullyChargedShw Sir, consider yourself booked, rant-cams on standby.
I think we've been stressing @SurveyMonkey a bit with the #FullyCharged survey, it's under a bit of strain, if you are filling it in, please be patient.
It's a survey, we've never done one before, and reading some of the comments, we may never do one again, have a look anyway:-) #FullyCharged  https://t.co/cCUh3MvSJR

@nicholasclark13 Wow. First I’d heard about this. Great shame as you say, he’s been a great advocate of the Renault-NIssan push to electrification.
@red2011dragon @FullyChargedShw Please, there's no need to apologise, at best Twitter is a confusing minefield, either that or a septic pool of bile, so any polite interaction is a delight. Very grateful for your support and interest, thank you.
@melancholysci @easyJet The links are below the video on Youtube but here you go anyway. https://t.co/p3zRqMRAt6
@MrKilpingBanana @easyJet Using the 'celebrity bandwagon' cliché as a way of trying to belittle completely justified criticism of the insanity of oil sands is also very very cheap shot.  It's also wrong. To say oil sands extraction is "the safest and most ethical source" is pure comedy.
@mcevad124 Saving that tweet for future reference. I've been with my Mrs for 30 years, she's never ironed a shirt. Not mine or anyone elses. She doesn't know how to use an iron. It's 2018, not 1953 :-)

@CraicDesign @Maker_of_Things @helenczerski @tuftywhite @FullyChargedDan @LNeckermann @sidatkins @maddiemoate @CarolineLucas @Carpervert @ManMadeMoon @elonmusk While that aspect is true, the environmental and energy cost of me posting this tweet, doing a google search or reading a web page is not inconsequential. Server farms burn through petawatts each year.

We've got some exciting little announcements coming to #FullyCharged soon. Keep an eye out.
@Monkeyspit Mate, I wish. No, I'm stuck on a damp island off the coast of a thing called Europe :-)
@BroWolstenholme Thank you so much for that lovely comment. Really cheered me up. So glad you're enjoying 'Some Old Bloke.'
@veloaficionado @KahrenRakete Aaah, now that utterly bizarre comment makes a kind of twisted, bitter sense. Your grandad sounds like he was an extraordinary man.
@mrgvh What an utterly pointless, tabloidtastic and supremely dull response. Yawn.
The big downside of mentioning 'the B word' is my timeline gets a bit busy. I'm doing my best to avoid all mentions but I suppose it's all a bit critical at the moment
@edmundofludlow Or is it more like running, full speed, in a blindfold, off a massive cliff. LOL
You know that whole brexit thing, how's that going at the moment? Is it causing any stress on our political system? Are most people really really happy with how its progressing? Does it still seem like a really really good idea?  Asking for a friend

@GarrettClive @nemo20000 @JudgeTread @AssaadRazzouk Genuine question, is the carbon footprint of building a large gas/coal/nuclear power plant taken into consideration?  Slightly more concrete and rebar needed, like 10's of thousands of tone more. Just a thought.
Oh well, I won’t be going to Blackpool next weekend. Very sad for @DannyJohnJules but he done good. That man can shake his felixsapian booty like no other.

@edmundofludlow @Bowldylocks For starters you're making assumptions about the way I live scant evidence. That said, if everyone could live like me we'd need a bigger planet, of course. So, what do we do? Carry on regardless or find solutions. We all need to change the way &amp; amount we consume.
@edmundofludlow @Bowldylocks This is the core of the 'there's too many of us!' hysteria. They don't mean 'us' as in Europeans, they mean 'them,' as in Africa and Asia. There's too many of 'them.' But the truth is, their birth rates are dropping faster than anywhere else.
@rwhd1931 I'll reply, at present the only electric car that can tow a caravan is the Tesla Model X. It's a bit expensive but there are more tow capable vehicles in the pipeline.

@mowersandthat Having read some of your other tweets I've decided to casually stroll on and ignore you.
@mowersandthat Oh yes, for me it's all about appearance, no substance what so ever. I ignore the huge amount of data and research that utterly disputes your tired old claims about battery manufacture. It's just about looking 'green' because I'm so incredibly shallow.
Feel a bit sad that @DannyJohnJules came bottom of the list thing tonight, so if you know what I'm on about give him a vote #TeamDamy
I just watched @DannyJohnJules on #StrictlyComeDancing and I thought he was rather good. Okay, he's an amazing, talented bastard. I reckon could have done 0.0004% of that dance.
@humphbecket @Carpervert @She_sElectric Not yet but announcements and details coming very soon. Don't worry, it's happening. Bigly.
@douglasduncan @57d26mNorth Okay, I'm very sorry I upset you. That certainly wasn't the intention and I would politely suggest that this is part of a transitionary discussion, not an all out, immediate civil war.
@brooktop68 @awjbisme @AmazingChevVolt I had been flooded with this link when I posted that tweet.  https://t.co/kozSv25roY I knew from anecdotal evidence that many PHEV's were never plugged in, but most intelligent owners charge them at every opportunity. It's a transition thing
@ECApaulreeve The following tweet that you missed: ... a plea like this on Twitter never works, but the flying train, the stupid animation I retweeted.  It's a bloody stupid idea, it'll never work, I stupidly thought it was funny. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. It wasn't my idea. okay.
@taxicab38 I didn't have room to mention that most EV's have artificial sound at low speed, also, and this is very important, it's the drivers responsibility to drive carefully. We all need to adjust to that. In areas with pedestrians I drive VERY slowly.
@brooktop68 @awjbisme @AmazingChevVolt I have never, and will never criticise people who buy a PHEV and plug it in. That is not what I said, implied or intended. PHEV is a massive step in right direction, story was about people not charging them, which clearly happens.
@dr_m_inthenorth @SmartRGW Shows how thick I am, hadn't understood what picture conveyed. So yes, the Oulander has Chademo (big socket) and type 1 charge connector that doesn't lock. All new EV's have type 2 that does lock.
@taxicab38 My main response (and I've been asked 1000;s of times) is Rolls Royce spent 100 years making their cars as quiet as possible, no one seemed very concerned. EV's are 'silent' below 10 mph, after that they makes as much noise as any modern car.
Good point, well made. https://t.co/d7gqkhI03f
@steamtrainmark That's wonderful to see Go Brizvegas!
Excellent counter to knee jerk anti PHEV reaction. This is what PHEV's should be doing, thank you https://t.co/SDaSO7oKnj

I'm going to do some gardening, but here's an alternative to PHEV's, flying trains and urban air toxicity. #FullyChargedShow  https://t.co/M2L3NTqB2m
@57d26mNorth I surmised that my tweet might result in replies like yours and I'm really pleased to hear it. I think they can work as a transitionary vehicle, if you plug them in as much as possible. We had one for years, always plugged it in.
@Rjdlandscapes Excellent sir! Keep at it, you're one of the few.
@davepermen I agree, draft notion although the plane would be electric so the noise will be dramatically reduced. Electric aircraft are coming very soon.
@Bristolboy I think, sadly, you're an exception. I drove the Outlander, charged it like a Ninja and was really impressed. Average 80-90 mpg in a big car. But I have spoken to many who have never plugged it in.
@fishter_uk There are versions that are brilliant. Jonny Smith has the Vauxhall Ampera, 50-60 miles on electric, the BMW i3 REX, brilliant. The rest are all fairly meh.
Oh, and while I'm passing, and a plea like this on Twitter never works, but the flying train, the stupid animation I retweeted.  It's a bloody stupid idea, it'll never work, I stupidly thought it was funny. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. It wasn't my idea. okay.
The dizzying speed of the demise of plug in hybrids and the plug in car grant in the UK is something to behold. People who drive 100% electric always knew but were mostly (like me) too polite to say... PHEV's are almost never plugged in.
If I had a dime for every time I've been told, 'no point trying to change technology, the population is expanding so fast we're all doomed.'  We might be doomed, but it might be 'because there's no one left. https://t.co/WuoF9hFhy5

@SavineSnape @IcelandFoods Interesting, thanks for that info. I can only assume Iceland and Greenpeace came to some kind of agreement.
Two things. Ban an advert for @IcelandFoods because it's 'too political" and it'll get huge coverage elsewhere, and two, I never thought I'd be retweeting Iceland but this is a really good start. https://t.co/H35mu0IcPE

@NigelPlaner1 Oh Nige!  Blimey mate, that looks nasty. You poor thing. Hope you recover soon. x
@alexfarran I think it might mean more gas, it will certainly mean more wind utilisation, more storage and obviously more solar. I think we can see that coal is dead.
'Ello Tosh, want a Toshiba?' 'Eeerm, not right now thanks. Bit pricey and not very practical.' https://t.co/bunh2T4cAT

@ThomasEvansSDP @jtchivers @KateFantom @ecocars1 @pluginadventure @B_McBeardface @She_sElectric @ecotricity One more thing, 80% of the power going into my battery is from solar. If you mean the cars, they charge at night when majority of generation is wind and nuclear, but you carry on with your weird charts from 1998
@ThomasEvansSDP @jtchivers @KateFantom @ecocars1 @pluginadventure @B_McBeardface @She_sElectric @ecotricity What is the source of that pie chart, and when was it released? Those figures do not match recent changes and certainly don't reflect hourly shifts in energy generation. Basically I dispute them with vigour, but I'm happy you like Red Dwarf
@ThomasEvansSDP @jtchivers @KateFantom @ecocars1 @pluginadventure @B_McBeardface @She_sElectric @ecotricity No, entirely inaccurate, dated and pointless, but carry on.
I sometimes like answering @zuffle but he's 90% wrong 90% of the time, living in a blinkered angry world of confidently knowing everything and eagerly correcting anyone who doesn't agree 100%. Funny and a bit sad.
@zuffle @evmanuk @106Euan @paul_carnall I readily admit I'm often wrong, but not about coal in the UK. I've spent time at Drax B and discussed mainatance schedule. They turn power station off, sometimes for months at a time. You are 100% wrong, was always. All generators have to close for maintenance.
@_JD77 @VolvoTrucksUK @freightincity @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert Ooooh, nice. Yes, definitely. High on the list
@zuffle @evmanuk @106Euan @paul_carnall It is simply not true that 'we are always burning coal.' We always have been burning coal until 2017, when for the first time since the industrial revolution we had first hours, then days, now weeks when we burn zero coal. None. And at night most generation is wind and nuclear
@red2011dragon Same old hogwash. No, not really, utter nonsense.
@dlt1366 @bvrla @PhilipHammondUK @_HonestJohn @NicholasHellen My thoughts are long and complex, far too complex for Twitter. Nothing is impact free, but all I can suggest is lifetime of battery (25-30 years) and Canadian tar sands. 2 extremes which could help frame the discussion.
Nice book collection sir! https://t.co/Nw6ED46Zfg

Bit of relaxing, Sunday morning viewing for you on #fullychargedshow  https://t.co/Z1widN6zue
@Pete_Knight_ @Carpervert @nico_rosberg Depends on the car. Some plug in hybrids you can override the automatic system if you have enough charge, but you're right, majority of drivers don't bother.
@bertchalmers @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert It's very hard to give a single answer to that, due to the variety of power inputs. EG, my Tesla Model S. 85 kWh capacity. 13 amp domestic UK plug - 30-35 hours 32 kw wall socket - 7 hours Tesla Supercharger - 40 minutes (if the battery is flat, which it never is)
While very aware that the Porsche 918 Spyder is a plug in hybrid electric car, and not 100% electric, we were very happy to put @Carpervert in it beside @nico_rosberg to go for a short jaunt. #quitefast #fullychargedshow https://t.co/Z1widN6zue
Also, just so you know, @Patreon supporters of #fullychargedshow have had 3 full length specials shot on the day we filmed with Nico Rosberg. Proper, exclusive content. #justsaying  https://t.co/tjyrjTw1L8
I'll be honest, I never dreamed that one day, the little channel that was #fullychargedshow would feature a Formula 1 champion driving a hybrid hypercar around a track. #flatout #fullchat https://t.co/Z1widN6zue

Glad you enjoyed it. https://t.co/Z1widN6zue https://t.co/JvwmQd13cG
@SmartRGW Everything and more for Patreon supporters
On #fullychargedshow with @Carpervert and Nico Rosberg and  who's rather good at driving awfully fast cars. https://t.co/zZPWDEwcsV
Coming in just under an hour, a very exciting and rather swift episode where we meet an admirer of #fullychargedshow with a very specific set of skills
We’ve just watched the #fullychargedshow episode that hits your screens tomorrow morning. OMG. It’s the fastest episode ever! https://t.co/rPd9hM32L8
@BBCPolitics @Arron_banks I'm so glad you're giving this poor man even more airtime. I mean, you've only had Faragé on 67 times in the last 3 years. I'm sure it's perfectly normal practice to allow someone being investigated for criminal offences to prejudice a potential trial. #tragic
@robtelford @Synchronicity34 @LValoisXI @Durgemeister Totally 100% agree with you. Just replacing today's millions of ICE with millions of EV's while an improvement, doesn't solve the underlying problem of millions of cars lying about not being used for 90% of the time.
@TwelveM0nkeys @emmajanemackay @unbounders Not that I know of. Das tut mir sehr leid
@robtelford @Synchronicity34 @LValoisXI @Durgemeister 99% of articulates on road surfaces come from ICE vehicles, from exhaust gas. This is a such a spurious, debunked argument. 3 million ICE vehicles burning fuel. 250,00 EVs with genuine, zero emissions. It's comical.
@robtelford @Synchronicity34 @LValoisXI @Durgemeister This is where this research clashes with direct experience from EV drivers. Tyre wear is generally lower than ICE vehicles, break wear is incredibly low. The motor slows the car down, region braking is far more efficient. Many drivers rarely use brakes.
@Landi683 Heaters work when car not running, you can also pre-heat the car when plugged in. In modern EV's heater does affect battery &amp; range, by about 1%
@devangelslondon @audibleuk @stephenfry I will be recording an audiobook version of #someoldbloke (I have read 15 audiobooks for the BBC over the past 20 years) :-)
This is so cool. https://t.co/5oZqSZWkB1
@robtelford @LValoisXI @Durgemeister That bit of research has a very long, complicated and quite murky history. Funded by a Swedish diesel engine part manufacturer. Here's another study. https://t.co/5Nd0ID4XS1
@LValoisXI @robtelford @Durgemeister I guess you have to read the whole tweet thread. I know you didn't say that, but @robtelford did, and you're right of course, people shouldn't drive their kids to school unless there is zero alternative. Walk, ride bike, bus always 1st 3 choices
@MonashG There are now about 40 alternatives available, and many much cheaper. Hyundai Kona, same range, less than half the price. #JustSaying
@robtelford @LValoisXI @Durgemeister It is, sadly, not extraordinary that this utterly debunked 'study' is trotted out time and time again. It has been so thoroughly rejected by every university and research body on earth but still it comes back. It's also very boring and utterly wrong, but carry on.
Or you could try an electric car. #justsaying https://t.co/qyvBrIDMZB

And 2nd https://t.co/U09IMUo2hs
I'm going to plug a couple of episodes of #fullychargedshow now because they're a) new and b) really interesting, oh yes and c) they look amazing. 1st   https://t.co/POQn3rn2uF
@GPDavies79 The people to ask are @unbounders but as far as I know, I've signed a massive pile already but I think they're already spoken for.
@alanbrownllg That is absolutely the plan in a nutshell. I am very aware that  me in particular, but also the whole team fly too much, so we're working on developing teams (it's not just presenters) around the world to create episodes.
An update about Renault's electric car developments, new models, new apps. The Renault K-ZE looks very interesting, only China for now. https://t.co/DGqnacY8nr
New episode of #FullyCharged about the success of the @RenaultZE Zoe and the new app that goes with it, that's actually useful. https://t.co/U09IMUo2hs
Without question on of THE most disturbing, bizarre and downright weird images you are likely to see this Halloween.  Wash my eyes with carbolic soap (no palm oil) https://t.co/PG13uysjIk
@DrPB @dallascampbell Oh, for goodness sake put your phone down and read a book! :-)
@garyingram62 Yes, via the @unbounders website. Look for 'Some Old Bloke.' It should be there.
In case you missed it. Truly amazing episode of #FullyCharged about a truly amazing achievement. https://t.co/POQn3rn2uF
@OfficialABQ @chris_norgate I feel bad because I may have over reacted. I get about 250 'hydrogen is the answer/future' tweets a week, and while it clearly has a vitally important role to play, the misconceptions around it are too numerous to list, especially on the Twitters. Hey ho.
@Warayemon The drawing is inside the book, so it gets some prominent coverage and much discussion took place about that too.
@Warayemon @unbounders There was much discussion about the pictures, for weeks, I didn't have a clue, I'd have preferred a picture of a carrot :-)
@rangers1873 Not long then :-)
I will be recording an audiobook version of 'Some Old Bloke' ASDAP, it will be available on @unbounders https://t.co/xzFWKtcBxN
@chris_norgate @OfficialABQ I will try and dig out the vehicles you're referring to. I have driven 4 different HFC cars, 3 had large battery packs, one, (it's brilliant) has ultra capacitors. Without some on board storage, a fuel cell takes too long to supply enough power for normal driving
@chris_norgate @OfficialABQ Not the ones you saw in London. What ones are those. Do you have any reference to them? I'm genuinely interested, I'm absolutely not against HFC, far from it, but as with all tech, there is an impact. HFC is far from 100% benign, just like BEV's
'Some Old Bloke' will, eventually, be available as an audiobook through Unbound. I'll post links when it's ready. (I've got to record it first)
Trying not to plug my new book too much, but if you're interested, you can order it here and it's not Amazon. https://t.co/o6GSN7G7fP
@chris_norgate @OfficialABQ Oh my God. You've actually gone down the 'why not use hydrogen' argument which underlines your ignorance. All hydrogen cars have large lithium ion battery packs, and the fuel cell contain many very expensive and rare elements that have to be mined.... by hand!!
@rallystar944t What, as in an effort to make me look younger and more handsome. LOL. I don't think so. I think they might have used the 'old tramp' filter.
Nothing to see here. Move along please. https://t.co/TWEUeprzHJ
@chris_norgate An ingredient in old lithium ion batteries. Soon to be zero cobalt. But please keep burning diesel in cities. That’s much better for everyone.
@chris_norgate All big battery manufacturers are developing ultra low or zero cobalt batteries now, for economic as well as ethical reasons.  ‘Artisanal mining’ which is the story you’re referring to, is truly horrific and 100% unacceptable but makes up less than 1% of global cobalt output.
About to do some signing. #SomeOldBloke https://t.co/Eeahn7uLay
@chris_norgate All the items in your list are A) questionable or B) untrue. If the material in literal billions of batteries being manufactured today were all ‘mined by hand’ as you claim, we’d need trillions of children down trillions of holes. Maybe check sources for such claims?
The original idea that motivated me to make #FullyCharged was that we needed to develop technology that didn’t need to burn stuff in order to work. It’s still the motivating idea. https://t.co/07AoMc6cfB
The latest episode of #FullyCharged is ‘one of the best things I’ve ever seen on YouTube, full stop’ said one happy viewer.  https://t.co/POQn3rn2uF

Something tells me the team are less than convinced at my ‘Tech Legend’ status. https://t.co/I97e1R4Kpe
@Lozart_airbrush Yes, so sorry, stupid to be in the least concerned about any impact from fracking. Just drill and pump and extract money from tax breaks, sorry, a small amount of gas from shale. Which we burn. Once. LOL.
@EarlTheLeaf @106Euan @WonderfulEngr @TeslaInTheUK This kind of hysterical FUD is increasing in frequency and will rise to fever pitch in next few years. All manner of utter tosh ‘studies’ are going to appear, same old story though. Diesel is clean. LOL

@dubious1977 @au_tom_otive Drove past 3 rapid chargers on Seven Sisters Road on Sunday, so there are some, and more coming
Coming soon on #FullyCharged https://t.co/9FvRGW1Mqy
Today we are mostly looking at this. Made by @teamuniti and on #FullyCharged soon. https://t.co/rBZAEn3RS8
@louthbedschris @Jimwhit69 @tkcarter82 Episode coming soon on #FullyCharged about the @SonoMotors Sion. Car covered in solar PV
@Peterawhitton @Jimwhit69 It's already happening, but I agree, it's going to be a while before it's common.
@drpuk @Carpervert @Dyson It's impossible to speak to anyone at @Dyson for very understandable reasons. I've spoken at length to one engineer who works there, he was quite forthcoming. They're building electric cars. That was it. :-)
@46since96 @dannycrm @Jimwhit69 New charging hubs will take multiple cars for some more minutes, they don't take 347 hours to charge as some people claim. 150 -350 kW chargers already being installed.
excellent break down of costs.Thank you. https://t.co/1tx5Ibah4R
@Jimwhit69 @tkcarter82 I'm sure you're not, but it's a fascinating challenge, I'm a crumbling old git but I can see this change coming and it's going to be messy as well as beneficial. Disruptive technology is, well, it's disruptive.
@OSU487 @bcmlubbers @Jimwhit69 @Fastned @Bannatyne How long is piece of string. There is no typical electric car.  At home, off peak, (at night) works out at 1p-2p per mile.  At rapid charger more expensive but faster, more like 3-4p per mile. If you have solar PV it can be free.
@Jimwhit69 @tkcarter82 Couple more things, imagine less cars. If we share cars we'd need less of them, we don't use them that often, plenty of time to charge them. &amp; worth remembering pumping highly toxic, explosive fuel is currently seen as 'normal.' In 20 years time it will be seen as barking mad.
@Voyager03 @Jimwhit69 I don't know where to start. Okay, I give up, there's no possible solution, let's stick to importing oil, burning it in inefficient engines and stay in the 20th century. The human race never come up with solutions to problems. Never. LOL
@Jimwhit69 Just a mild correction. 60% of UK households have off street parking, so 60% of families already have no excuse. On street charging not essential if there are adequate rapid chargers in cities, which is happening. Charge 1 or 2 times a week. Easy #notanissue
@alisa_murphy @cpsross @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw What she said :-)
@Jeff_Alen Sadly, or maybe sensibly, she's not.
@Gingyi1 @MatthewJSOliver And one more thing which made me roar laughing at you. You actually used the term 'fake news.' Utterly pathetic, unthinking, reactionary, knee jerk and the definition of moronic. LOL.
@Gingyi1 @MatthewJSOliver Sometimes it's worth looking outside the blinkered, narrow view of nationalist politics. It's just possible the Saudis sell oil, quite a lot of it, to the rest of the world.
@nathanrae Oh blimey, I forgot about that one. It was a bit special though :-)
Latest news episode from #FullyCharged show. Short, punchy, possibly amusing in places, fun fact filled frolics. https://t.co/Zuc7uRAUNm
@skeewiff @WillFealey @The_PlugSeeker @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @EVNewsDaily @BethLilyRace @jtchivers @TheConWom Well yes, there is that :-)
@TheConWom Just wondering if you would consider an alternative view, written by a woman, about the emergence of electric cars and their wider benefits. For your blog. Asking for a friend.
@Arfatweet @JeremyLeggett @FullyChargedShw I'd say it was more than a mention, more a 'homage.'
He has a point. https://t.co/ok7KzsYj3U
@themakersname You gave yourself away in the final phrase. The casually dismissive "whatever climate / energy problems you believe exist?" There is no belief involved, just acres of data, research and hard economic reality. As for unfettered free market, there's a lot of it about right now
News update on #FullyCharged with a bit of a #fracking rant, but also some interesting positive stuff. Hopefully. https://t.co/Zuc7uRAUNm
@UKtechie @TheConWom @teslanomicsco @transportevolve Just had a quick read of the first paragraph. Clearly this individual hasn't studied anything resembling facts. UK electricity is generally around 50% nuclear and renewables, over a year, renewables provide 27% of our electricity, coal, 5% and dropping.
Oh my life. @DannyJohnJules jived the living dooberries out of that.  Amazing.  The first 10 score of the series! Incredible.
@SteveHa30404522 Might it be what you get when a knee jerk, reactionary cadre of power hungry elitist old blokes make ludicrous claims and baseless allegations for decades without any means to facilitate actual change and then run off and hide while blaming anyone nearby. #BrexitShambles
@SickRobot1980 Sorry, I couldn't get to the end of the title without yawning. It's such an old story, so 100% totally rebuffed by vast, deep studies from all over academia and engineering. It's endlessly rehashed, funded by... I can't imagine who.
For those wondering what I might look like in the shirt. https://t.co/FCyu8UKh5Q
OMG. Should I? Even at my age? Really? https://t.co/uPFelrfumA
I will be watching @DannyJohnJules and @dowden_amy on Strictly Come Dancing tonight. Seriously. Do that wonderful Jive sir. Such complex by rhythmical humanoid movements. Most impressive.
@PearlFlowerGirl It's just possible you totally misunderstood the irony in my tweet.
@ElPataLoco I think we were told again and again by a very rich, power hungry elite that it would be simple, quick and it would stop millions of Turkish immigrants 'flooding in.'
@slackaliss I've heard this argument many times. It's almost clever, but there is literally zero comparison. How long can we use 1 gram of rare earth metals? 50 years. 100? How long can we use 1 gram of fossil fuel? 0.001 second
@TeslaMotrsports You can find out more here. https://t.co/Jc9qQ8aaKq
@jennylandreth Sad to hear that, but you know he always found himself highly amusing :-)
@ElPataLoco Totally agree the people voted, &amp; the majority elected to leave the EU... No question, and now we know what it actually means, how complex, how expensive, how debilitating for the country the majority are saying hang on a minute.

Shush, don't mention weapons sales. https://t.co/fgv28sofcE
Please don't tweet anything negative about #saudiarabia regime, or mention #JamalKhashoggi because we're very dependent on them for our oil supply. And certainly don't suggest developing technology that requires 99% less oil. :-)
@EvEvangelist @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert I'm really sorry for the confusion but I cannot see different images for the Paris episode. I can only see this one. https://t.co/PY0BSEJilj
@JefferyIrvinPhD Fascinating to see the impact of new technology as it is widely adopted.  A steep increase of rooftop solar in Australia is causing temporary disruption, mainly to the old fossil industry. They will fight back, and fight dirty for decades.
Kia Niro, Audi e-tron, Mercedes EQC, Peugeot e-Legend, Smart EQ and more from the Paris Motor show with @bobbyllew and @Carpervert  https://t.co/7BAsMqj0qB
@BionicIguana @MyEnergiLTD Yes, but I don't sell it, I don't have a Feed in Tariff (FIT) because I feel I benefit enough as it is. Just my personal choice, although the FIT is about to end anyway and it's pathetically small now.
@CopleyHill @Carpervert A lot of love saw it at Goodwood this year, didn't see it in Paris. Oh blimey, was it there?
Love these moments. Tesla Powerwall at 100%. It’s sunny. All excess now going into Nissan Leaf courtesy of @MyEnergiLTD #zappi charger. https://t.co/UQt45VAEL7
@Clive__Horn I haven't seen an example of that yet, possible drawback is electric motor may not be powerful enough, and electronics in hybrids complex beyond the dreams of Gods.
@Jellan_ @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert No, beautifully engineered, as the cover goes up the little flap on the CCS port closes without jamming. Sweet.
@susfolk @Costingtheearth @CommonsBEIS The BBC's editorial attitude to both EV's and renewable energy is a deep, disturbing mystery. I'm sure the top dogs at the Beeb all drive around in diesel Range Rovers, park them discreetly then ride into the office on Brompton's.
@ES_Raechel @James_BG @FullyChargedDan We certainly know how complicated/frustrating/baffling it can be but it's getting better. Worth checking out @ubitricity for on street charging, easy to use if you can find parking. Also some Shell garage forecourts in London have rapids, expensive but easy to use.
Paris motor show, everyone was looking at the electric models. Diesel models tucked into a dark corner near the door. #fullychargedshow was there https://t.co/7BAsMqj0qB
@djfox67 @Carpervert Thanks, glad you enjoyed it. The Euro road trip and many associated episodes should be out in the next couple of weeks.
@Richard28861 @FullyChargedShw That doesn't wind me up, that makes me very happy. If only a sensible decision such as the one you made were taken up.
I wandered around the Paris Motor show guided by the wonderful @Carpervert which was a great help.  We checked out the Audi e-tron, the Mercedes EQC, Kia Niro, and the stunning Peugeot e-Legend and more. #awooga https://t.co/7BAsMqj0qB
@mariamcerlane You are the only person I know who could rock a pair of white leather roller skates :-) x
@NLODC Thanks for getting in touch, we will definitely come again, annoyingly we did a big trip around the Netherlands recently and just didn't have time to see everything. We really want to come. 2019 for sure.
@Short_Tesla_ @FullyChargedShw You are something similar only with a slightly different spelling. You tragic, ill informed goon, go and annoy someone else. LOL
@ric__harvey @FullyChargedDan They do, if you mean the chargers, yes, @MyEnergiLTD
If you've got a moment, what @DeanFieldingF1 is suggesting here is fascinating https://t.co/TpgGYZKQUZ
I've just watched a couple of episodes coming to #FullyCharged this week. OMG. They are kind of special. Patreon supporters, you're in for a bit of an early treat. #veryfast
@AndrewLee1987 It does.
@SickRobot1980 Try @zap_map  That's my fave
@Short_Tesla_ @FullyChargedShw You are so dull.
@DannyJohnJules @bbcstrictly @dowden_amy @PetulaLanglais Brilliant, go #TeamDamy  Love it.
@Hass_Aslam Yeah, I might buy half a dozen just for the bants... LOL.  Don't want to destroy your fantasy about my life, might not be quite as stinking rich as you suspect :-)  But yes, we're going to see plethora of big, expensive EV's next year. But smaller cheaper EVs coming too.
I'm not sure what I said, but it might have been inappropriate. Jonny Smith and I at Paris Motor Show last week. #FullyCharged episode coming soon, with Audi e-tron, Kia Niro, Merc EQC, Renault EZ Ultimo and loads more https://t.co/NcZpplzc2X
"Oooh, that's a nice one Jonny." https://t.co/ppBh5rpjUn
Jonny @Carpervert Smith and I had a poke around the Audio etron in Paris last week. Very nice car, interesting wing cameras (not mirrors) and double type 2 sockets. On #FullyCharged very soon. https://t.co/qmnm7GX8XO
@HennyStDave @FullyChargedDan I think you're right but there isn't yet anything you could call the autonomous car industry. There's loads of different companies working on different systems, but eventually I think what you suggest will be essential.
Ooooh, exciting... https://t.co/muxujHoYTE
2nd time I’ve used @ElecHighway rapid today in my old Leaf. Both times no probs. Okay, it’s chademo, okay I’m a softee ecotricity apologist (apparently) but thought it worth mentioning https://t.co/T9EglucNnU
@MegaMike1983 Thanks for the reminder that I once had hair and a slightly smaller waist measurement :-)
@Amanhas50935590 That is demonstrably untrue, easily refutable. I suggest you attend Fully Charged Live 2019 and meet the hundreds of ordinary people on low to mid level incomes who already drive electric cars, because they're cheaper.
@swiv2010 Ceres fuel cells also run on hydrogen, and I think the argument is that the desperate, absurd technology used in fracking to try and eke out the last gasp of fossil fuel defines 'short sighted.'
@BobAndersson I totally agree, the general attitude toward offshore wind, even electric cars and tech innovation is to be applauded, and I have done so on many occasions. However the start of fracking is a ridiculous and desperate backward step.
@zeydou Another good point.
@Swoopert Yes, very good point.
Of course the current administration are totally committed to encouraging sustainable development, by cutting subsidies for cleaner cars, supporting fracking and investing in massive oil rigs in Bahrain. Onwards to a glorious independent nationalist future!

@Short_Tesla_ I'm going to repost your tweet, followed by a corrected version. "You got to love how we brainwash are young" I think you mean: "You have got to love how we brainwash our young." I'm doing this to illustrate the general intelligence behind the comment. LOL.

@McCons What a lovely fella.
@Mandalorean @EvChargerDirect @zap_map @FullyChargedShw @ApiElectrical It would be insane to spend that kind of money. I lease my car, contrary to the notion that I'm a multi billionaire global celeb (LOL) I could never afford to cough up that much. But yes, Govt should encourage uptake, and still does for EVs.
@lunnbodiddly You have a very serious and important point, but there are already 100's of folks with nowhere off street to park who drive EV's. With increased range, lower cost, you only need to charge once a week. And 60% of UK housing has off street parking.
@ConcatNonsense I think 'they' are working on it 24/7. Thousands of new charge points going in all over the country
When I look at the price of petrol/diesel, then hear how 'electric cars are only for the rich,'and knowing you can lease Leaf/Zoe/Kona/SoulEV very reasonably or get 2nd hand Leaf/Zoe for £5-7k and it's so cheap to run...
@SpareCharge @UniofBath Is it possible the notion of 'owning a vehicle' (generally the 2nd most expensive item anyone buys after a house, in use 10% of its life) is going away even faster than fossil burning machines?
@otleyshev68 @FullyChargedShw We’re working on something for 2019. Shhhh.
@maddiemoate @Magooligum @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Damn. Okay, you drive off in it, cut to me and Jonny looking like two 5 year olds who’ve been told ‘no sweets.’  #majorsulk

@SirWrender @Raithtech_UK @Carpervert OMG, love it
@thehistoryguy Hopefully you can appear in an episode of #FullyCharged and explore the history of the energy industry to find out how we got here, which might help point the way we should go now... just a thought sir.
@shandcunt @SpeakSarahSpeak @thehistoryguy @RippleEnergy I can confirm that Sarah is a real person who is trying to do amazing things. I can't wait to see what @RippleEnergy can achieve
@ELPinchbeck @therealvicz @TerryCox60 @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @alisa_murphy What she said. And the bird thing. I would agree if we first got rid of domestic cats, glass buildings, all road traffic and airborne pollution. Wind turbines are a tiny % of man made bird deaths
@ManMadeMoon @FullyChargedDan Yes you do. I know you want to see it. It's going to be awesome. #capturethegas
@therealvicz @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @alisa_murphy @ELPinchbeck "Tree hugging propaganda?" Occasionally I'm mystified by humans :-)
@77A @FullyChargedDan @ecotricity @GoodEnergy @octopus_energy @OVOEnergy @PurePlanet @tonikenergy @FullyChargedShw @ManMadeMoon Population decline is the genuine elephant in the room.

@Stephen36049088 Interesting response only with the observation that there are dozens of comments on the episode where people accuse us of jumping on the 'Musk-hater' bandwagon, and that we slag off Musk too much. Hey ho.
@PadraicMcD Damn, that's the secret plan. (coming soon)
So pleased to read all the positive comments for the latest #FullyChargedShow news panel episode. Fun, fact filled and data rich. #kinkedhose https://t.co/jGOHPTyZpS
@nigelwickenden Sadly not one thought. I need to read up on what they said and what turned out to be the case. Assuming there's a gap.
#FullyChargedShow news panel. In depth analysis of the news, and  some Q&amp;A's. https://t.co/jGOHPTyZpS
Thank you! https://t.co/FCFkw1by06
@baxter_wa We really want to, that's the plan. Scotland is at the forefront of renewables, we have to come!
@JaceCear This try out recording was open to any Patreon supporter who could get to Bristol. In future we hope to record all over the world, and we will announce recordings and locations well in advance open to anyone who wants to come.
Just released. The first #FullyCharged news panel, recorded in front of a live audience in Bristol... a week ago. Nearly breaking news! https://t.co/jGOHPTyZpS
Oh smeeee,  I cannot believe they put something that rude on a wall! https://t.co/eg0sVmkwI3
@McCons @RicTrott @MarshallJaguar @EVDriverUK @FullyChargedDan Yes. V good idea
It’s very sweet really. https://t.co/RUjiXievmH
Yes, that’s it. I hate the taylor tech nerds who invented inside pockets! https://t.co/FhaFZqZqza
@Bristolboy That’s very flattering but although I am in your wonderful country I’m not very near Glasgow:-(
Okay, so these sort of tweets are the least interesting in the history of all human communication but look what I just found in my inside jacket pocket. ( I still hate apple and android) #oldmanfail #nottheactorgary https://t.co/irRz7rX0lZ
@yeahchap Yeah yeah, I could just buy the airport. And the plane!  But I didn’t discover I’d forgotten them until after we took off. Doh!
That made me produce a low impact LOL https://t.co/rWFkeRTjzQ
@dwangeddy @EVcarpetman @TooOCD @Daverjr @LBC @ivebeeniced So all 30 million cars will start charging at exactly the same time. Obviously, I mean how else could it possibly be done? What! We produce electricity at night. While we sleep!  Don’t think about it. Buy more diesel.
I wish @GM would bring something to the UK. And this is such a blistering example of what plug in hybrids should be like. 95mpg minimum. https://t.co/nxWiwN1ZtB
Okay, so although I’ve got boxes of old cable headphones, I’ve now got to buy bloody Bluetooth headphones. Okay.  I get it. I’m wrong. Androids are better. Apple is brilliant. Everything is fabulous darling.
Here’s the best thing. I say ‘don’t tell me to get an android ( because they all copy apple like sad sheep) and then I get dozens of replies saying ‘get an Android. They’re all annoying. 😉
Forgot to bring my tiny audio jack dooberry, can’t listen to audiobook on short flight. I curse the tech nerd fascists at @Apple who made the dumb as mud decision to remove the headphone socket. I will literally urinate on their trainers. And don’t tell me to get an Android 🤨
@au_tom_otive OMG, that was so the reverse. 15 mpg average I recall. But that exhaust note... still miss it.
@au_tom_otive I think I might be a bit efficient. I checked last night, the last 11,000 miles, 289 Watt hours a mile average. Last night's drive however, 307 Watt Hours a mile over 92 miles
@LudegoEV @franz_rother We noticed this, very interesting. Can't imagine you can do double cable charging but you never know. @Carpervert and I discussed this on our #FullyChargedShow report from Paris
@jon_tait Yes, I pressed the wrong button. It's coming out tomorrow. Sorry. Not quite finished.
30 years ago I started writing a book about a male curfew. I never finished it. Maybe I should dig it out if my bottom drawer. https://t.co/rPwQU6nrEp
@McCons I saw that too. I swear by them :-)
Lordy, I have a lot of catching up to do. Go @DannyJohnJules https://t.co/Gsa37rl4fQ
@Floann6 @MaxPinelli @Tesla Not that we're aware of.
Day 2 at #ParisMotorShow2018 https://t.co/mMgcdi8C6k
@au_tom_otive Just did a 127 mile run in my Tesla S 85 and got 268 Wh a mile. Motorway 90% of the time. Is that down to single motor?
@106Euan @VictorJones500 @The_PlugSeeker @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @IsabelHardman @ecotricity @plugshare @ecocars1 Euan, can I politely suggest that you're wasting your time, sweary Victor is enjoying himself too much. Ignore and move on.
@VictorJones500 @The_PlugSeeker @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @IsabelHardman @ecotricity @plugshare @106Euan @ecocars1 Fine, be offended and hurt, you clearly have no cogent argument about what I said. You're not a Luddite, don't flatter yourself.
Perfect for @CCfunkandsoul a self contained electric #Smart cherry picker DJ thingy. https://t.co/PkzPDc8Cdt
E-tron CCS cover action. https://t.co/lJIomHZQtO
Now I’m about to do an interview in the dedicated @YouTube studio. Nice. https://t.co/2vZ9rciHIi
@VictorJones500 @The_PlugSeeker @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @IsabelHardman @ecotricity @plugshare @106Euan @ecocars1 This is, with all due respect, a very tired old argument. The electric car is a new tech paradigm that can’t just be seen as a mere replacement of last century technology. Please keep your old car going for as long as you can. It’s fine, there’s no threat.

@inkpen99 @martinjguk @106Euan @The_PlugSeeker @ecocars1 @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @IsabelHardman @ecotricity @plugshare @POLARnetwork @Chargepoint @OLEVgovuk @BP_UK Another very important point that often gets forgotten. Rapid chargers are used around 4% of the time, they are not an everyday need. If they don't work when you need them then its a massive pain, I was 7kw sockets at every car park space. Slow charging.
@106Euan @IsabelHardman @martinjguk @The_PlugSeeker @TheEVdriver @ecocars1 @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @ecotricity @plugshare @POLARnetwork @Chargepoint @ElecHighway @InstaVoltUK @ChargePlaceScot @DBTCEV Yes, the DBT chargers aren't as reliable as new ones, yes the new ones are hugely more reliable and I fervently hope Ecotricity replace the clunky old ones ASAP, but they do supply huge amounts of electricity to 100's of EV's every day.
@106Euan @IsabelHardman @martinjguk @The_PlugSeeker @TheEVdriver @ecocars1 @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @ecotricity @plugshare @POLARnetwork @Chargepoint @ElecHighway @InstaVoltUK @ChargePlaceScot @DBTCEV Just to keep things in perspective a bit, you know, balance and all that. I've used the @ElecHighway for 8 years, relied on it (Chademo) and yes, every now and then it's let me down but 90% of the time it's worked, and for 1st 5 years it was free.
Oui, j'ai fait une faute de frappe. Ma faute. Je devrais être jeté du Pont Neuf!
@WWMilner Dammit, how did I do that! Je pensais être si intelligent. Pardon #Renault
@IsabelHardman @martinjguk @The_PlugSeeker @TheEVdriver @106Euan @ecocars1 @Bruceha23791470 @MailOnline @ecotricity @plugshare @POLARnetwork @Chargepoint @ElecHighway I completely understand your frustrations, the technology is still in its infancy and is only recently approaching reliability. All I know is it IS improving and more widespread. That said, the forces ranged against new technology are powerful.
Je suis à Paris pour le salon de l'automobile. Demain, de nombreuses nouvelles voitures électriques seront dévoilées ici. Merci #Renualt.
@paulkushner @ProfRayWills certainly no raw material shortage, if anything there's a glut of lithium at present. I'm also not sure they are a 'nightmare' to manufacture and as others have said, they have a 25-30 year life expectancy, and 95% of materials can be recycled. https://t.co/il4ep5kJfb
@moonkinydmf Yes, that's why we did it :-) Hopefully this week.
I’m thrilled that the 1st news recording in front of an audience went so well, great panelist’s and even my cock ups weren’t too disastrous. Thanks to all involved https://t.co/CAd8gNd9aI
And yes, we will be discussing Elon Musk and the #electrichighway
The set’s looking good, that backdrop is incredibly realistic #FullyCharged news. https://t.co/kPaNIKaeXM
Getting ready to record #FullyCharged news, which, we fervently hope will go out very very soon. https://t.co/O64d5S5WVU
@CrampedEyes @FullyChargedShw Not as far as I know... sorry
@doggydogdoc @The_PlugSeeker @kirbalicioussss @forduk @OVOEnergy @POLARnetwork @ecotricity So, no retraction or apology for you posting the utterly fictitious image of open cast mines, okay, you are better than me, you've won, you're really cool.
@doggydogdoc @The_PlugSeeker @kirbalicioussss @forduk @OVOEnergy @POLARnetwork @ecotricity Because you used a sad old image that's used by endless #bots designed to spread fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. You use a snarling dog as your Twitter avatar so all the clues point to #troll.
@BSS57 OMG, what a brilliant idea. Thanks... and no, but there is something which might contain something like that coming next year.
@BuilderinBraces You're not kidding, damn, I hate news, it keeps happening. Can the world just stop! Until we've done the edit.
@doggydogdoc @The_PlugSeeker @kirbalicioussss @forduk @OVOEnergy @POLARnetwork @ecotricity That image has been totally debunked for about 2 years. If you don't know what the pictures really show, then you are either stupid or spreading FUD. You joined Oct 2017 and have 1 follower. #fossilbot
Fairly big wow. https://t.co/hXiqCnou6T
Latest episode of #FullyChargedShow now available. @Carpervert compares the BMW i3s and the Mini Countryman Cooper S All4 E PHEV...  https://t.co/2qsTZkzM5K
@RobertOstry @Carpervert No, it's all down to our rather slow post production workflow, which we are desperately trying to speed up
Been busy cooking but have been hugely uplifted and inspired listening to Bertrand Piccard telling the story of Solar Impulse. On The Energy Gang podcast. https://t.co/LWijbDa9j6
@MedCrisis The term 'everyone on Twitter told me to' worries me. I'm constantly being told the most ridiculous things I must do on Twitter and by default ignore them :-)
@Gurmehar_0117 @Carpervert That said, I'll be in Paris next week so I'll definitely have a look
@Gurmehar_0117 @Carpervert I stopped paying much attention to rumours a long time ago, I wait until I'm sitting in the car trying to work out if it's turned on or not. I hope it will be a genuine step forward in technology.
Join @Carpervert as he compares the BMW i3s and the Mini with a long name. https://t.co/2qsTZkzM5K
I'm sure a lot of you have seen it, but just watched Jonathan Pie:  Back to the Studio on #BBCiPlayer  Brilliant, bravura performance.
@Costingtheearth @PeterGWeather @FullyChargedShw @BBCRadio4 ‘Electric Car’ by They Might be Giants?
Wow. Sadly not surprising. https://t.co/HRlu7anihp
For reference when some know all ignoramus tells you ‘the poor need coal to escape energy poverty.’ https://t.co/gltT05WteN

@loudmouthman Interesting, I haven’t heard that before. Will investigate
I just got an award! Big thrill. I don’t deserve it but it’s very nice. #T3awards https://t.co/o4z7rfsT9L
@FullyChargedShw Oh stop. Okay,  not just yet. Stop tomorrow.
@FullyChargedDan You’ll have to speak to my people.
@HarrieO That is correct. YouTube. Search for Fully Charged Show. It’s quite easy to find 😊
Will be discussing this with @DaleVince on Sunday’s recording of #FullyChargedNews https://t.co/EtOhRkyCu9
That’s me that is. https://t.co/J3QqklJIx8
I’m off to the Ministry of Sound. Yeah, I’ll tell you why, later yeah. I’m clubbing.
@NewpPaul @Carpervert We might have to slip it in.
@Carpervert @NewpPaul LOL, I suppose so but I know I was effing and jeffing as I wiped down my surface stains.
@NewpPaul @Carpervert Just heard this tragic non-story on the news while I was cleaning the kitchen. Luckily I was alone as I was shouting bad words at the twat on the radio :-)
@almurray @jlsinc Lol 😆
@jlsinc @almurray What a delightful man Piers is. I met him in 1975 in London when he was a squatters activist and a massive pain in the jacksy even back then. Very happy to be a mentally ill/brainwashed #deluded #moron if he's the alternative :-)
@richardlpbtn @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Having spent two days filming at one of UK's biggest refineries, I can assure you the process does use copious megawatts. Massive substation beside the plant, direct connection to coal fired power station, but they also burn oil to produce final products.
@Sofieatlast They eat some grass, the walk around a bit, eat some more grass. That's about it.
@shandcunt @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Very very soon. Already recorded, 2 new female presenters. That's the long term plan.
@Mozz1camera You will.
@zimpaz You betcha.
@Synchronicity34 @RichardGledhill @chris6770 @SeanCoyne2112 @FullyChargedShw You could be right, worth experimenting though, new episodes within brand limitations coming soon.
@tksalvo I didn’t take either picture. The pink floyd one was taken on Lee’s camera but I have no idea who took it. Sorry, not much help.

@scottymeuk @FullyChargedShw @justforall @FullyChargedDan Didn't know about this. Thanks for the link. We will definitely look into it.
@JonasRoothans We did do this one you might not have seen. https://t.co/FIfGPVCGB9
@SaffySnaps @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @tonyseba We will try to, some day. We met him in Amsterdam earlier this year. He's on the list
@RichardGledhill @SeanCoyne2112 If you think that was 'lecturing,' I think I should do some actual lecturing, big, strident, shouty, accusatory, judgemental lecturing just for comparison. I'd call it 'ruminating.'
@liamthom The important bit I forgot to include was the fact that the land I was on should either be forest or pasture for cattle. No one could grow beans on it, less than 2 inches of topsoil and then rock. As I say, it's complicated.
@foofly Good point well made
Our average 'thumbs down' count on #FullyCharged' is in double figures (on episodes with 100k + views.) On this episode with 30k views so far, 678! Contentious? Cows. https://t.co/I0uR5Rs4xx
@CalNicolson1 @D0li0 Yes, what Ryan said.
Thank you https://t.co/9EPdePBIzZ
Sigh. FUD being fed to kids. This is just simply wrong. https://t.co/H2z9qUGb3O
@cleevelymotors @FullyChargedDan @InkSharkman @Carpervert Of course. You’d be very welcome
@HorzaPanda They are small. Dexter cattle. https://t.co/acowCZJQ1t
@jimbartus Good point, yes, that would have been a good idea but this was a really quick, off the cuff piece. We should maybe do a more clearly defined agri-business-oil-business comparison episode, but this one has already upset many.
@CraigCRogers @daviesdjandy80 @B_McBeardface @ecotricity @ElecHighway @DaleVince @YouTube @evopinion @FullyChargedShw @BBCNews @PrimeVideo @FullyChargedDan @InkSharkman @POLARnetwork I'm not too scared, I'm just trying to be positive and constructive. This Sunday we're recording a news show where we discuss this very topic. There clearly are serious problems with @ElecHighway especially with CCS but there's solutions in the works.
It's not cars, it's cows. A short walk in a cow field, might be contentious, there's loads of car episodes coming but in the meantime, Moooo. https://t.co/I0uR5Rs4xx
@MisterG_8 @CoryGroshek @Peugeot Hope so, we are trying
@SteveHa30404522 @dpeilow As an early adopter of 1st gen hybrid technology, I think it's fair to say hybrids use less fuel per mile on average, but they still use it. They are petrol cars with clever add ons making them even more complex. Hmmm
So many amazing episodes coming up on #FullyChargedShow and our most recent one is a hum dinger. Just in case you haven't seen it yet. https://t.co/V9lyh1ME73
@incognitosock1 @JeremyClarkson Well, it's not really very surprising is it. And it is quite funny.
@B_McBeardface That will never happen.
Damn, he's good! He's the top Felix Sapien https://t.co/pqJPOuoZ4w

@cleevelymotors @FullyChargedDan @Stidston We are recording a news episode in front of an audience on Sunday afternoon/early eve. Free to #FullyCharged @Patreon supporters
@helenczerski Welcome back. Sounds like you had an amazing time
@DaveChubb Oh, sorry, I get a lot of messages about EVs and I can't tell e legit sensible question from a troll goad or a joke. Please forgive. Loads of info on #FullyChargedShow  https://t.co/rlBaoYNKL6
@DaveChubb Uuuuur, no, it does a realistic 280 miles on one charge, which you probs knew but I'm just being literal
@phuzi_ Well spotted. Proof that electric cars don't work. 1.2 miles is rubbish, I need to drive from Devon to Scotland every day, there and back non stop and tow a 7 ton trailer. :-)
We've just test driven the Kona over 1.200 miles and it was incredibly impressive. Review coming soon on #FullyChargedShow https://t.co/8j93k7vLJY
@Stephen36049088 I don't know what there is to say about him, he's a narcissistic bully who must be very hard to work with, but he's clearly very intelligent. He has made deeply offensive and entirely unnecessary remarks on Twitter. Is that any good?
@Bristolboy @RichardHCNourse @ElecHighway @FullyChargedShw @DaleVince @ecotricity We are working on covering this, hopefully with positive news. I have recently had problems trying to charge a Jaguar I-PACE using CCS on @ElecHighway pumps
@Mozz1camera @DannyJohnJules No, definitely not... yet, but I think we will see a big disruption in the energy sector within the next very few years, there's tech coming for domestic users that give us more leverage.
@KevR_7 @DannyJohnJules I normally find it hard to watch but I've been sucked in. So happy for Danny, he's clearly having a ball.
@DannyJohnJules you absolutely set fire to that floor sir! Me and the Mrs were screaming.  #strictly2018
I am pathologically allergic to reality TV shows, old gits with fake tans and teeth judging young people trying to sing. And I'm actually sitting down watching #strictly2018 to support @DannyJohnJules  #sacrificeanythingforyourmates
@Synchronicity34 @DickWinchester That’s almost cruel. :-)
@groktrev @ManMadeMoon Never done a satnav voice. It’s been suggested but never recorded
@AndrewOsborne36 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @Hyundai_UK My boot is a mass of charge cables, single shoes, old socks, apple cores, books etc. #deepshame

@LeighMorrisey @PeterEbdon Yep, that’s what my mother in law says.
And we’re done. The 2018 #FullyCharged road trip is in the digital can. With @Carpervert @InkSharkman  and @TorchyDesign https://t.co/TknFHJLcrZ
@grafikschrubber @Papamatti @davidlaneimages @SonoMotors @Carpervert Once again I say maybereserve judgement. #Sion could be cheapest EV when launched next year. I agree, walk, ride bike, public transport, and lastly car. A car you don’t own. @SonoMotors has car sharing support built in.
@PeterEbdon Oh my Lord. Mind numbing
@Tesla_Bill I think you should reserve judgment a little. They are not claiming it would charge car 100% of the time. But when it’s parked, in daytime, it’s always charging slowly.
@2IdiotsEA @ecocars1 @SonoMotors @Carpervert No, nothing except the steering column. Totally different car

@Weeksy1808 It’s all about forward planning. We’ve got a long stretch to cover in the morning and I needed a gentleman’s comfort break. The car has 250 mile range. I have 170 mile bladder range.
@NKTDESIGNCOM You could start by watching #FullyChargedShow on YouTube, nearly 400 episodes of electron goodness
@NeuTimmerwerken @ReijerKok I hope we’re allowed in the Netherlands. We are all very polite.

Tesla Model 3 #FullyChargedShow  Major hats off to @InkSharkman and @Carpervert for dealing with altitude, jet lag and bright sun in Colorado, but they were helped by a lovely bunch of Tesla Model 3 owners. https://t.co/V9lyh1ME73
Tesla Model 3, test driven in Colorado by @Carpervert for #FullyChargedShow  Beautiful https://t.co/V9lyh1ME73

@widodh @Carpervert @Fastned That is very high on our list. We are meeting @Fastned folks in Amsterdam and testing chunky chargers
@GuanoLad @Carpervert We even have walkie talkies! However, unlike the original Top Gear, we're less macho, if one of us has a problem, we'll all stop to help sort it out.
@nickclaridge @Carpervert Aha! That's one of the first in the UK. It's the Hyundai Kona, 100% electric, with a reported range in the 250-280 mile bracket. We will see. Lovely car though. Full review from myself and @Carpervert who actually knows a lot about cars.
@markiliff We are releasing the final 3 this coming week. We've had a bit of a backlog.
@wormholeextreme @RedDwarfHQ @DannyJohnJules Sir, I don't wish to patronise but I think the idea is, if you follow the link and read the article, all will be explained. :-)
Tomorrow the #FullyChargedShow team head off on a Netherlands road trip in these 3 cars. @Carpervert (not pictured) will be one of the drivers. We're seeing much else besides cars. V exciting episodes coming soon. But not as soon as Tesla Model 3 review coming later today. https://t.co/G75fM1Too7
@stanaway LOLz, no that's the Fully Charged studio (chicken edition)
@pfierens I'm very used to single phase 7kW charging. Been doing it for years.
@rustyhusky69 @rider45 Once you've driven one for a week or two you don't worry about either, especially if you can charge it at home. Always a full tank when you wake up. We're driving 1,000's of miles in it next week. Results on #FullyChargedShow soon. https://t.co/rlBaoYNKL6
See our first review of the Jaguar I-PACE on #FullyChargedShow  https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov

Hello. https://t.co/psDeRw9Kvd
@inkpen99 @ukspacegov @m_plewes @sparklefingered @Carpervert Can I briefly mention the hundreds of thousands of people who used to work the land before the industrial revolution, around 80% of the population were agricultural workers.
Today @Carpervert and I are driving this. It’s a hydrogen RCV (refuse collection vehicle). Okay it still uses diesel but much less. Any truck could be fitted with this system https://t.co/VaYv6rFxHq
Uuuum. This. https://t.co/gr92f5EeNZ
@MikeTonge As always. Best reply. 😁
Yeah, okay, there is that. https://t.co/NxXbLkVZg2
At #LCV2018 in Birmingham, was held at door by nice security men in smart suits. I had to wait until the Prime Minister had left the building. She REALLY doesn’t want to meet me. 😐
That is an amazing achievement for a mere humanoid. Most impressed! https://t.co/FQesmxlMp0
@Billyneemates @FullyChargedDan Uuuum. Renault make the Zoe, Nissan make the Leaf. Zoe is certainly the budget EV du jour
@meadetd It’s complicated. Big gripe is fossil fuel lobby very keen on hydrogen because they can sell it. 95% of hydrogen currently comes from natural gas. In contrast you can make your own electricity and BEVs are way more efficient
Good point https://t.co/xmyuNbwvOn
@TransDevon All the crash tests these cars have been put through suggest the hydrogen tanks are very safe. Even when shot with armour piercing rounds. Plenty of other issues with FCEVs but I don’t think this is a big one.
I'm chairing a panel at this event tomorrow afternoon.  "How far can consumers take the drive to zero emissions?" Looking forward to learning more. https://t.co/6E2ggbZpkE

@KevinEtheridge2 @FullyChargedDan @OLEVgovuk @transportgovuk Yawn, sorry, have just read that totally incorrect assumption 11,000,000 times.
@UnleadedJunkie You are correct, I make a right mess of it but I was jet lagged out of my tree :-)
@airmonkey1 If there was any info around that subject we would have reported it. No, nothing yet.
3 weeks today, our Patreon supporters in South West UK could come and watch us make #FullyCharged Live News recording in Bristol https://t.co/AZkwZ4KmDW
@michalsetlak I'm not 'promoting' anything, merely illustrating that this technology exists and is being developed. I think it's very important to remain open minded about any alternative to internal combustion, and burning stuff we can't produce cleanly.
Even though I tried really hard I still screwed up the city names. I said Pyongchange not Pyongyang. But other than that, hopefully it's stimulating and interesting. #HyundaiNEXO https://t.co/RCZLK9aZ3Z

@TheRealMike Google ‘better place,’ a company that tried to do just that for some explanation
If you support #FullyCharged on @Patreon we’ve just made a little announcement about 30 September. Check out the Patreon page for deets.
Oh blimey. https://t.co/TU0ntthEvu
Interesting https://t.co/IwVaK0vdou
7:30 this evening I’ll be on @ITVTonight with @GinnyBuckley talking about electric cars. I’m working so I’ll watch on catch up. Hope I didn’t make a fool@of myself.
@MercedesBenz I'm not an SUV fan, but if people who might buy an SUV buy and EQC I'd say that's a win. The range is important, I've heard 200 miles NEDC, surely not correct?
@jaredspeters @MercedesBenz We reviewed the electric SMART last year @Carpervert loved it. https://t.co/wue6BZuN4B
Just watched the launch of the @MercedesBenz EQC, (previously featured on #FullyCharged  It's a big SUV, 100% electric, just a reminder that they also make the electric Smart, which is a bit smaller. https://t.co/kpdadnvuQE
A fairly impressive endorsement https://t.co/pLpivkJMIn
@JordeeGee Me and Chuck are best mates obv. But I think all strings were discreetly snipped many moons ago https://t.co/diqbG3sWih
Electric bikes are coming, go further, have more fun but of course you still have to pedal. #FullyCharged https://t.co/uXlxrpceve
@willowchicken The current UK electricity generating mix is historically the lowest CO2 ever. Battery technology is developing very rapidly, materials used are changing, the materials can be recycled at end of life. (25-30 years) I haven't managed to use recycled petrol/diesel yet.
@kezzlebob @RedDwarfHQ @DougRDNaylor @DannyJohnJules @CCfunkandsoul @normanlovett1 @LuciePohlComedy @RichardDGNaylor A most happy birthday ma'am. x
@scottw666 @FullyChargedShw They are all on YouTube already, oh, except for 2. Coming this week.
Electric bike popularity grown at record pace all over the world, and just starting in UK. Check out some new models on #FullyCharged  https://t.co/uXlxrpceve
@Zebsmattz Cycling in London transformed from when I was a daily London cyclist in the 1980's. Loads of car free cycle lanes, far more people on bikes, generally safer. And we rode high end models on show. Many E-Bikes for around £1500. Prices going down as market grows
"I'd love to ride a bike if it always felt a bit like riding downhill." #FullyCharged takes to two wheels with @Carpervert and @bobbyllew https://t.co/uXlxrpceve
A sparking new episode of #FullyCharged all about electric bikes. #cycling #urbantransport https://t.co/uXlxrpceve
True that. https://t.co/k5KSDT9MnF
@Danbo I wish I knew why it doesn't show up on mobile but here it is anyway. https://t.co/tjyrjTw1L8
If you make a cataclysm of errors, it's worth trying to make amends.  The apology episode: https://t.co/qjSsskkFIx
@totally_cars It does look like a big step on for the tech, I went to see something along those lines in 2012! https://t.co/iTiqtoJniW
@lazis002 I was given it at the 2018 Leaf launch event in Japan. I don't know if Nissan dealerships have them. @NissanEV_UK ?
@InkSharkman Good point well made. Yeah, coasting is good, but then long downhills are great when re-genning so maybe the IONIQ paddles are a good option. Easy on/off regen
@InkSharkman OMG! Can’t wait to see it. E pedal off!  What the wha!
A bit of an apology for the last, mostly incorrect episode of #FullyCharged  With some interesting bits, I hope. https://t.co/qjSsskkFIx
@Pionir @FullyChargedShw Thanks for the link. And this says it all.  "...most brands deliberately exclude electric options from their retailers’ bonus schemes — so advising a customer to buy an electric car instead of a petrol one could mean a dealer is less likely to hit that month’s bonus target."
@Rbyn_Rox I've asked that, basically no they don't, apparently there's not enough weight to make it worthwhile.
@images_gc @ecocars1 LOLz, I think it was 94.8 miles, but then this was measured by a a clunky forks mounted counter with a little nobble that went 'ker-chink-ker-chink' as I rode along.
I've managed just short of 95 miles in one day on a bike when I was20. Chris Ramsay has just achieved 180.75 miles in 12 hours on an eBike.  https://t.co/ITPCK6sgtv

@BFC84Ash Busted on that point sir, although I got back yesterday afternoon, so slow twitch.
@ClairePayne Yes!  I can’t believe it either
Just come back from a family holiday. Didn’t take any photos, didn’t post anything on Twitter or Instagram and still had a good time. Yes, it is possible (-:
@jennyeclair No. Sorry. Apple based typo.

@unklerupert @FullyChargedDan We will be next month
@Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Agree. Brilliant idea. We should try to see them.
@Shappy113 We would love to, it’s a question of budget, we are a self funded show without a big broadcaster funding us, so getting to China is quite a challenge
Excited much? https://t.co/CHrNNuXiBC
@yarruMwerdnA @william_sw @au_tom_otive @StephenWensley There is a shortage of old batteries because they're lasting much longer than predicted, it's the exact opposite of your assumptions. Massive demand for old batteries, little supply. And battery recycling at true end of life is easier than petrol/diesel recycling :-)
@yarruMwerdnA @william_sw @au_tom_otive @StephenWensley I am under a constant deluge of information about 2nd life vehicle battery systems, we're soon going to see a multi megawatt battery supporting a large solar array in the Netherlands, made from Nissan Leaf battery packs. 15-20 year life expectancy
@FredBorloo Yes and yes.
@DJBurges @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw I think it's very hard to tell from the picture, also energy density has increased so much it's really impossible to predict what the range might be.
Delighted to hear you enjoyed it sir https://t.co/Hy4VeKdswr
@satpalram It can charge much faster. At the moment Tesla are lead manufacturer in terms of charging speed, at 400 volts. The Supercharger can deliver 120 kilowatts, adding around up to 500 miles range in an hour. 800 volts is twice that speed, 350 kW, adding 200 miles + in 15 minutes
An excellent solution :-) https://t.co/zVtfIK7iK4
Very interesting. Can't wait to see the finished car. https://t.co/vOEagzRAYr
@rachelkonrad @JordeeGee @ImpossibleFoods Steady!
@DannyJohnJules Craig who? Do I know him Sir Danny?
@WiebeWkkr Extraordinarily smart sir! You look much better than I ever could, hope you're having fun in Australia.
@PVBuk It was one of your replies, that's why I mentioned it :-)  https://t.co/D88tEfd0nV
@JaceCear @aminorjourney @amerikate To be accurate, it's a very Welsh name. Llewellyn is very common in Wales
@PVBuk I'm trying to think of a polite way of countering the absurd argument made by your friend's mechanic. I can't come up with anything other than it's a lie. A blatant lie. Not just a slight mistruth. A simple lie. It's nonsense, watch Euan's video. He knows his stuff.
@aminorjourney @amerikate definitely related. I knew it! Other than the fact that when I looking in a Swansea 'phone book' back in the 1980's, there was about 400 pages of Llewellyn's
@uhavenofreedom It's CGI, from a movie, it's not a real robot.
@whitnashwizard No, it's CGI. From a movie.
@DaiShandy Excellent news! Really looking forward to it. Might be a couple of surprises on the night.
@WaterstonesUxbr No problem, I thought it might be a little premature :-)

@BSS57 @MissDashboardUK The most disgraceful people I've ever met who are constantly effing and jeffing are also the poshest people I've ever met.
@edmundofludlow Maybe read, or at least look up 'People Quake' by Fred Pearce for a very different take on 'the population problem.'
Apparently I've been 'outed as posh' in the latest episode of #FullyCharged with @MissDashboardUK in a Range Rover PHEV. If the few posh people I actually know heard this, they'd choke on their canapés. https://t.co/xqHeLXzkyV

@GraemeBell5 I'm going through some confusion. Are you asking if the woman in the picture is my daughter? If so I would have to have been a father at the age of 12, which even with my impressive masculine credentials would be pushing it. That is Cathy Rogers, inventor of Scrapheap Challenge

Maybe I should do a little update on Fully Charged about it, along with the 90,000 other updates I have listed but haven't got around to :-)
@nuclearforus @jordanmackinnon @markcojuangco You're welcome sir, you stick to the old, out dated tech for as long as you can, your president is on your side, clean coal all the way baby.

@nuclearforus @jordanmackinnon @markcojuangco I am, it's very sunny, I'm charging my car... for free. Just rubbing that in for you. Free. No cost. Also heating water, running computers. For free. Just rubbing that in. No fossil fuel use. None. So yes. Very happy. Ha ha.
@jennylandreth Enjoy :-) (although I will admit.... I'm less cute)
@jennylandreth Look at you! So cute!   xx
@nuclearforus @jordanmackinnon @markcojuangco Isn't that glorious. 100% proof that everything you've ever said is 100% correct all the time. Because everything is black and white isn't it. Off, or on. No grey areas for you. Life is so simple.
Imagine storing excess solar energy in your hot water tank. Check out the Mixergy tank on #FullyCharged  https://t.co/Xj7TtADP2s
@ItalianSaints Thank you. That's very encouraging to hear. Loads more to come.
@cicottrell We are shortly going to do an episode about the solar PV, powerwall, Zappi and Mixergy tank conflagration at my house, and how it all works together. I'll need help from professionals.
@Skeptical_John Took me a moment to understand your tweet. Are you suggesting I'm a 'Tesla fan.' If so, I have never been an anything fan. I don't do fan
For those (I suspect the majority) who have little knowledge of Tesla's recent fiscal shenanigans here's the statement. https://t.co/566BHiketd
@MorinMoss @ibroxmassive Well, leaked might be a little bit misleading. It's posted on the official Tesla website.
I'm not going to pretend for a moment that I understand #Tesla a public company going private, other than a lot of very questionable and hostile people had invested in the hope that they would fail. Some seriously ugly wealth in the world
The internet of tanks. Hot at the top. It's Mixergy on #FullyCharged  https://t.co/Xj7TtADP2s
@oaedoel @beisgovuk @NIAUK A fascinating suggestion, with just one minor drawback. Cost of installation (£20-30 million?) and where we store the waste, other than that, brilliant. Okay that's two minor drawbacks but you get my point.
@gatrymccann I don't, but in September, when we are filming a range of electric boats, we might find out

@nuclearforus You took your time posting counter arguments, hence the 'oh oh, oh' like you were running for the bus you nearly missed. But you carry on with your pointless points, they're almost interesting.
@TheRealMike My Nissan Leaf, 2011, scratched, dented, 63k miles but 100% reliable, is now so cheap to run it's embarrassing. The last 15k miles have been fuel free. (solarPV only) so yes, tyres, insurance, service, still less than 3p per mile including all costs
@pstni Oh yes, just show's how unreliable I am with figures, it did seem a bit hyper-cheap. Thanks for correction.
Worth noting. 0.003p per mile is quite cheap isn't it. https://t.co/hZttoQtOho

Bit of a news update in case you missed it. #fullychargedshow  https://t.co/P2J3OwUxnT
@A1GOY Very glad it's not just me. I thought I was just a tragic old fool who couldn't make these damn smarty pants phones do the right thing.
@A1GOY I've had similar issues and it's mind boggling. Even paying through a banking app is painful and results in multiple errors. Every other company/individual I need to pay is super simple. Gnnnng
@GuanoLad @NoratorSignal @SimoneGiertz @KariByron Yes, I still see Cathy every now and then. She still does know her onions as well as many other organic systems, especially brains
@TiffTools It will lose some charge if left for several days. I don't know how you'd judge exact amounts, but maybe a couple of miles range a week. If you leave it for months it's best to set charge for half full and plug in. Just tops up once a day.
@NoratorSignal @GuanoLad @SimoneGiertz @KariByron I would like to thoroughly support this idea. Approach Netflix to do a re-boot. There might be someone there who's interested, just saying. #scrapheapchallenge
@TiffTools It's a medium sized leap I would suggest. Essentially it's just a car, and if you have somewhere off the street to park and charge it at home, then you wake up, in winter, will a full tank and a warm car every morning, and you drive it without a 2nd thought.
@valtarys Indeed, could be 'fake hot.'
LOL https://t.co/sMjZpNeUGj
@TiffTools In my 2011 Nissan Leaf, big impact, very old tech heater, very inefficient. In the Tesla Model S, I'm sure it has an impact but you don't notice and in all new EV's heating will reduce range but by very minimal amount. Plus you can pre-heat/cool while charging
@Stephenphs Yes
This is a very important point that I frequently forget. Thanks for the reminder https://t.co/e6ogZIkGQ3

@evmanuk I don't get it, but then again I am quite thick.
@edmundofludlow @Chromatic_Blue @SkyNewsPolitics @SkyData Pleased don't read anything into my retweet. I didn't want the first go, don't want a 2nd go, I'm just observing the very profound shift in public opinion as the whole sorry and impossible nonsense unravels before our eyes.
@ruralleafowner Hmmm https://t.co/H16ecX9TmJ
@MikeLary88 You'll be able to see all of it on the #FullyCharged YouTube channel, no fear.
@Oddsodz No intention of only posting on IGTV. YouTube is still the primary outlet.
@timhorrox Yes, it will be on Patreon.
@Oddsodz Don't worry, we'll never put stuff on IGTV that isn't on YouTube. We're not changing anything on YouTube.
@TcpProtocol Wait, I thought Facebook did that, oh wait, yes, they own Instagram. Okay, don't watch it there, it'll be on YouTube soon
Just to briefly explain, we will be putting episodes on IGTV occasionally and you need to watch those on a phone. We will still be using YouTube as we always have.
@moonkinydmf Uuuuuur. Yes.
@Palhil Yes, it's different but sort of the same. You can watch it on your phone. You can also watch it on a computer but it's better on the phone

@Helen200581 @DannyJohnJules @CraigCharlesTV Clearly your mother is a highly intelligent humanoid. I send my warmest regards ma'am.
@2DoisToby Wow, 2010! I have no memory of typing that. Nothing much changes, oh wait, yes, things have changed rather a lot. We are now living in Daily Mail land. Hey ho.
@ebeling_J @FullyChargedDan @mrjamesob @She_sElectric Regarding HFC cars. 2 things to remember. They need big batteries, an currently 95% of commercially available hydrogen comes from fossil fuels. My electric car is 80%+ powered by renewables, much easier to arrange than producing your own hydrogen
@ebeling_J @FullyChargedDan @mrjamesob @She_sElectric If, massive IF, the public are 'forced' to buy electric cars in the future, and the charging infrastructure is exactly the same as now, without one single new charge point in the UK, then yes, you are 100% correct.
@pluginadventure @FullyChargedShw I've just had an idea, I should drive a big fat 7 series diesel Beemer from Brighton to Edinburgh and keep close watch on actual fuel consumption, cost, amount of toxic gas released and interview people at filling stations about how much they enjoy paying for fuel.
@lunasekai @GJtjilp I don't think the cartoon is about any one specific government action, and also you have been told, by big powerful companies that make money from you, that the climate accord is a tax on poor people. That is called a lie
@advandermeer @Carpervert @Vegebutcher Thanks for the heads-up. Will investigate
@moulton_16 @MikeHobsonEsq @databeestje I appreciate your honesty, and I certainly never suggest that wind is THE answer, that's preposterous. A combination of many solutions, including wind, solar, storage, EV's, smart grid systems might very well remove the need for the Holy 'base load.'
@SVTCOL @ACFred I like the fact that you know, precisely and in great detail, exactly what the future will bring. I wish I had that skill.
@Carpervert I want to try and get them to bring some to #FullyChargedLive next year. Not currently available in UK
@ivebeeniced @GreggJaskiewicz @TomBarnardPR @The_PlugSeeker Yes, all very unfortunate, it was a bad day. There are multiple charge points at that location, many PHEV's already parked and plugged in. Only one was left not plugged in. Shame really. hey ho. On we go
@DanielStrzelec3 @ivebeeniced I have removed the image, of course I will not apologise. How dare you even suggest it. I may back down a small step if you apologise to me very profusely and immediately. You caused inconvenience, not me.
@DanielStrzelec3 @ivebeeniced So you park a plug in hybrid diesel in an 'electric vehicle only' bay when there are dozens of other spaces available. You don't plug it in and then you get cross with me. How delightful. And you joined twitter specifically to respond. It can't get better
@gt2andy I never mentioned CO2, there are multiple other reasons to stop burning coal, ask the residents of Mumbai, Shanghai and London in the 1950's. There is no legitimate reason to keep burning coal other than for old steam trains at weekends
@smeg___head About 99.99999%. It's already being organised
@ivebeeniced Really. There’s a diesel Volvo plug in hybrid?  Whatever. It wasn’t plugged in.
@moulton_16 @MikeHobsonEsq @databeestje Maybe using the term 'useless piece of junk!' indicates a prejudiced attitude. Summer solar, winter wind, it will take a mix, and storage, and electric cars. It's happening anyway so it doesn't really matter what any of us think.
@FredBorloo You are wrong. The birth rate in developed world has dropped off a cliff. We have declining population, if well educated, aware, intelligent people don't have kids..... well
An Impossible burger needs 96% less land 87% less water and of course  87% less greenhouse gas released.
Here's a bit of Impossible burger. They're rather tasty. https://t.co/FIfGPVCGB9
Dammit. (also very true) https://t.co/wQVg14RJPN
@Incorparated2 I agrees, no subsidies.
@Incorparated2 Well, because you hide behind a naff troll like name, you'll forgive me for not knowing what country you live in. Here's a report: https://t.co/5VulUi9GZ4
@Incorparated2 You are just simply wrong. 90% of energy subsidies go to support the fossil fuel industry, they have more power and more leverage.  The developing world knows renewables are more sensible and are adopting them at dizzying speed.
@Incorparated2 What are you blathering about. 100's of millions live in dire poverty now, with coal, oil and gas companies going hell for leather to resist any change. Meanwhile solar PV and small batteries are bringing power to parts of Africa/India that have never had electricity
@Visit_Planet_J Oooh yes!  Can’t wait.
This cartoon from 2009 is still relevant today. #climate https://t.co/tjcsRGVIPI
@fantastic_place @gavinb21 @IzzyWizzyIoniq @IoniqChat @FullyChargedShw Wow, I never knew that little charging socket on the wall of my house cost £74k!
@gavinb21 @IzzyWizzyIoniq @IoniqChat @FullyChargedShw It's fascinating to read, but I think you can rest assured that the 'journalist' who generated this (expletive deleted) is fairly ignorant of the actual scenario playing out. Many vague references to facts mixed in with misinformation and deliberate lies
@Jura_sik @seocompanyhull @AndyG131 @BBCRadio4 So you're not in the least bit ashamed, even embarrassed that you tried to make some form of argument by using a picture of a diamond mine in Russia claiming it was a lithium mine? Really?
@Jura_sik @seocompanyhull @AndyG131 @BBCRadio4 For goodness sake, that is beyond pathetic. That is a really well distributed picture of the Mir Diamond Mine in Eastern Siberia. Whereas the picture of the car belching out toxic filth into a kids face is an everyday occurrence. Tragic.
Nice. Can't wait to try one https://t.co/MbbyC4Y2gj
@TweeterKav @dwauctioneer 3 feet long! No, they're normal size, beautiful beast he was.
@acmtix Yes, a big pile of waffle. However my daughter is reading it and said this, and believe me I was genuinely surprised. 'Your book is really good dad.'
We just had a big insecty visitor. We all screamed and ran out when he flitted about, he’s gone now. Beautiful but quite big for the UK https://t.co/9apjjf5jxV
@definitely_cn @AndyG131 @BBCRadio4 I did ponder about describing the truly excellent electric Smart in such a way. I know @Carpervert loves it, we did review it a while back. I know, they are great cars, it was just the choice of picture I was critical of.
@AndyG131 @BBCRadio4 Aaaaaand as always, the BBC use the image of an electric Smart car, not a Leaf, IONIQ, Tesla, E Golf, Zoe or any common EV, no, a 'funny looking little electric car'
@craigawilliams Thank you, so glad you enjoyed them. I'm in a pickle regarding fiction, got loads of ideas but feel there's enough fiction in the real world. Would love to write more though.
@Bluemerlin That is so lovely to hear, over 25 years old now!! OMG
@the_jstillwell Thank you, great title, might be 'Same Older Bloke.'
@ANGETERRY @mwt2008 @BBC Go for it. Cram those renewables mentions in.  Good luck!

@davidebrady You are beyond desperate with your classic diversionary nonsense. The vile acid attack has no connection to this story, but you go ahead and live in your mad, nationalist blizzard. Boring.
@xWeAreLegion A very narrow response to a huge, tangled and difficult problem. What she did was highlight the mess we're all in, make people aware this is happening. An ultra nationalist government in Sweden, even more nationalist here, you should be happy. Throw them all out!
@davidebrady LOL. He "may have been." Yes, let's deport anyone with brownish skin because the "may be." I'd rather be on the side of fools like her than bigots like so many Daily Mail readers
This is a 21 year old, same age as my daughter. The courage and determination is astounding, and the ugly voice of the British twazzock is hugely shaming for this blighted isle. https://t.co/0RzoP3B4K0
@Visit_Planet_J Yummy. Want.
@MrGeorgeClarke I see you are getting all manner of sensible and nonsense replies, maybe check this out. https://t.co/MPTcbfOBZw
@Herring1967 Well that's very kind. Thank you, glad you enjoyed it. I've found a tin of peas so carry on.
@Herring1967 What, right now, like this minute. I'm not ready, I need to get more spam.
Just posted a #FullyCharged behind the scenes from Warwick University battery research labs.  https://t.co/JdSEo9xqRd
@johnecohound @PeteG1001 @FullyChargedDan Did I say that? Really. I suppose it's sort of accurate, sounds a bit off now. I'll have to do an update.
Another great collection of talks from #FullyChargedLIVE   https://t.co/1MXNOlBkPD
@JimmerUK @david_bott @FullyChargedShw @helenczerski IGTV baby https://t.co/aq7UteWbh6
@nuclearforus @helenczerski That is a question which answers itself if you're rabidly convinced that batteries are of no useful purpose ever and every penny being spent to research better ones is a massive waste of money.
Next 5 talks from #FullyChargedLive just released https://t.co/1MXNOlBkPD
We’re filming at Warwick University battery research department today with @helenczerski     I’m shooting a short behind the scenes episode for IGTV. Shhhhhh. https://t.co/LVe0XAwMMb
@prestoncomiccon Dort = daughter. Don't know why she's referred to as that, but she calls me 'that tragic old man' so, you know.
@mysticl @DJ_PostIronic @ashmoore1 @Tesla I've definitely been there and done that. My old Land Rover had a dead fuel gauge for years, pure guess work. According to the AA around 2,500 people a week run out of fuel on UK roads.
@electric_thom It was done very discreetly, slip the paper onto the kitchen table and walk out whistling. Underhand #Mansplaining
@Petetmooney Yes, I do know that, I just thought a paper version would carry more weight.
@emma_holden I use @DriveElectricUK and they are all very lovely folks
Wife and Dort currently discussing, with passion, which is the mortar and which is the pestle in a mortar and pestle.  The Mrs thinks it's a 'pessle' with no T. Just printed out wikipedia page so we can all move on. (Mortar is bowl, pestle is the other bit)
Okay, yes, I'd support that big time https://t.co/ziBYqc4iP9
Yeah.... @FullyChargedShw  Where's the merch store yeah! https://t.co/hPNGKsv8fY
@meltymcface @EidentJo I'm far to modest to suggest that sir.
@EVWantToBe Thank you, excellent suggestion
@TheJAMF @FullyChargedDan Interesting idea, will investigate the possibilities with @InkSharkman and @FullyChargedShw
@DJ_SMIGGER @DougRDNaylor @DannyJohnJules @CCfunkandsoul Many happy returns Emily ma'am. Have a lovely day.
@OfficialABQ I've already done it, but now I'm going to do it again.:-) https://t.co/XoxlK5sx5B
Nice. For goodness sake, you can't get an electric car wet! Don't drive in the rain!! Don't wash it!! Aaaaargh. They're deadly!! Buy diesel! https://t.co/9uXcjnpiBX
@rico_de_paris Oh yes, that's just the tip of the thick-burg.
I never put to much credence on 'surveys' but if this is even vaguely accurate it's too tragic for words. LOL. https://t.co/r3QPvXCcMf
@Carpervert Cool. Where would we be without hessian head adornments.
I can imagine the new look J Smith esq might divide people in an already divided nation, but I think you rock that skull sir. https://t.co/8lcorlFVSw
@jonathandavey Probably because men are not targets of sexism, mainly because we do live in a patriarchy, not a matriarchy. Men might receive derisory comments or hatred from women, that's misandry. There is a difference between misogyny and sexism
@spodlife Yes, I shouted and pointed to it, repeating my explanation again and again, then reminded them that they didn't[t really understand. Normal stuff :-) (no, I didn't really)
@TerryCox60 No :-)
Just shown this to the Mrs and the Dort. They both loved it. Very clear. (I’m regularly guilty but trying to curtail the habit) https://t.co/Vb74M7P1v4
This is the IGTV link to the phone version. I’m still learning this stuff. https://t.co/iWT4tTraXH
@inkpen99 I think that's because 99.99% of people watch it on their phone. It will work on a browser, sort of.
@jon_tait @The_PlugSeeker @FullyChargedShw @plugshare I can't help thinking you will get some lectures from people who've never driven an electric car and yet seem to know EVERYTHING about them :-)
@alexfenlon @jon_tait @The_PlugSeeker @FullyChargedShw @andy4wm Good on you sir! I think we'll see electric bus fleets far sooner than mass electric cars and it's a much better solution for cities. Good luck, keep the pressure on!
@ggverte Instagram TV, recently launched, we have a channel on there but not enough subscribers to do what we want yet but we're getting there. https://t.co/7oBMTljzVu
@alexfenlon @jon_tait @The_PlugSeeker @FullyChargedShw It's a good job you disagree with the brake dust myth Alex, as it's totally untrue, yet another carefully planted seed of doubt to delay the acceptance of electric vehicles. It's a 100% debunked so called 'study.'
Experimenting with IGTV and strangely this little rant is very relevant to the mild upset cased by the latest #FullyCharged episode. https://t.co/7oBMTljzVu
@CarloOmbello @FullyChargedDan @robertllewellyn It's happened before and I always want to apologise to @robertllewellyn for the occasional odd message he may have received. Additionally I agree with sentiments expressed in this tweet stream :-)
@Carpervert c'est normal, n'est-ce pas? :-)
Wow, okay, so driving a tiny petrol car that does over 1,000 mpg has really upset some #FullyCharged regulars. Don't fret, normal service resumed next time. https://t.co/r48rIqB4Ag
@teslavangelist Well spotted Doc, it was a mild rash from scratching an itchy beard, more embarrassing than risky. I'm married to an Australian who is obsessed with dermatology and skin cancer, but I will go to my Doc and have it looked at none the less
@BritforRussia Just keep sending this vile racist, fanatical right-wing propaganda coming from one of the most corrupt, corrosive, ultra conservative, patriarchal and bigoted regimes under the sun. I'm not in the least interested, but please waste your time.
@BritforRussia You clearly haven't worked it out yet. I'm not interested, it does not matter how much so called proof you chunder proving putin is a saint, I'm not in the least interested
@BodDamnIt @davechannel Season 9, ahhh yes, that old conundrum. Only @DougRDNaylor knows what happened in season 9.
It's quite warm today isn't it. Just been out clearing stuff in the garden. I'm mildly moist. Lovely
Seen a lot of Tweets about VirginMedia no longer carrying @davechannel but all you tech savvy humanoids in the UK can still see it here https://t.co/Z4SQRFs8yx
This is the episode I was writing about  https://t.co/r48rIqB4Ag
@TiffTools Annoyingly there doesn't appear to be a way to find a direct link to the actual post, but this link should take you to the YouTube 'Community' page, and it's the first post. https://t.co/8kSw3TyVF3
@SANEAlex_ Thanks, correcting now :-)
I've just written this in response to some of the comments on the latest episode of #FullyChargedShow https://t.co/8kSw3TyVF3
Thanks for watching, this was the main reason I wanted to cover the event https://t.co/65JRaFxLEY
@jonajuna @slhelme I try and see the bigger global picture, the changes taking place around the world are rapid and very disruptive. Totally agree the electricity eventually, maybe, one day generated by Hinkley C will be comically expensive. Renewables much cheaper already
@jonajuna @slhelme I've been researching and reporting this topic for the last 9 years, every possible argument I've heard has been debunked again and again. No technology is perfect. ICE is very very far from perfect. Dated, Victorian tech
@jonajuna @slhelme On Monday we're filming a process where 95% of a Li-ion battery's materials are recycled, so it will be, can be and it would be daft not to.
@jonajuna @slhelme Sorry, just re-read your opening sentence. That argument, that CO2 impact of manufacturing EV's worse than lifetime of fossil burners has been debunked countless time. But still a popular shock headline. https://t.co/B93BHJvXI3
@jonajuna @slhelme Indeed many do suggest hydrogen and I'm confident that will have a major role. Maybe not in small passenger cars, trucks/busses for sure. Materials in fuel cells V problematic ATM, many say much worse than batteries. No one thing is 'THE' answer, for sure.
@jonajuna @slhelme Obviously I mean EV's are much cheaper to run, last longer and we can create the fuel for them in the UK, rather than importing £billions worth from fairly dodgy suppliers
@jonajuna @slhelme I don't berate those with zero choice, far from it. I berate the oil industry &amp; car makers for foisting dirty diesels on people and I agree regarding price, although they're much cheaper to run. I still argue that oil extraction, burnt once, is worse than Li-ion, recyclable
@jonajuna @slhelme I think it's the other 1%, nowhere near half. But here's the question, because someone on a nurses wage can't afford a high end electric car now, does that make the entire tech shift away from burning fossils irrelevant? Serious question.
New episode of #FullyChargedShow available. About very small cars that travel many 100's of miles on an egg cup of fuel or a kilowatt hour of electricity. https://t.co/r48rIqB4Ag
@PaulAdams72 @FullyChargedShw Thank you, IGTC is a very different medium and I feel we have much to learn.
@gavztheouch Yes, I know all about that Robert :-) and yes, very interesting, we are in touch and will hopefully do something with them soon
@Arthur40TwoDent Yes we did know, @Carpervert was there and we have an episode of #FullyCharged about it coming soon
@jaxd38 Good luck in tonight's performance sir, I can sense that you're going to rock the house, Lord Farquaad will rule. Knock 'em out! And enjoy it!
As always, very interesting comments on the latest #FullyCharged episode. Shell Eco-marathon, if I'd had more time I'd have shown that 40% of the cars taking part are electric. https://t.co/r48rIqB4Ag
@andyleaflinux @KateFantom @ecocars1 Check out @whitecar_rental
@FreakyFwoof Think of it like a giant cucumber with 3 wheels, 2 at front, one drive wheel at rear, you lie down flat to drive it, I was way to big to fir in but with the right sized driver it can cover over 10,000 miles on 1 gallon. Not much room for shopping though
I'll try that again without typos. New #FullyCharged episode about the recent Shell Eco-marathon. Watch an old man not get into a car and laugh himself silly driving another one. https://t.co/r48rIqB4Ag
New episode of #FullyCharged from the Shell Eco Marathon. Cars that do many 1,000's of miles to the gallon, that a re a bit small. For me. https://t.co/r48rIqB4Ag
@BritforRussia Oh do go and annoy someone else. I have admitted nothing. Stare at a picture of your hero putin. It'll be fine.
@BritforRussia Didn't realise you were going to drone on. Clearly you don't follow my tweets which are a regular string of criticisms of the BBC's news output. I don't know anything about football and I'm not interested in your arguments.
@BritforRussia Yeah, fine, there's nothing more to say. You carry on ranting in the wilderness
@BritforRussia Your arguments are byzantine in their effort. I don't give a stuff about Clinton, she didn't win, I never supported her, didn't think she was perfect. Your trump bloke has sided with a hostile power against his own government. That's historic. And entirely predictable
@HelloBrier @BBCRadioLondon @vanessafeltz It's the most common assumption, fostered by all BBC news outlets to this day. They have electric cars of 2010 firmly locked and loaded, @BBCNews seem to have no idea how fast things are changing. A bit baffling.
@ManMadeMoon @FullyChargedShw It's a Range Rover Plug in Hybrid. We've done a review, coming soon.
@jonajuna @slhelme I'm not a city slicker, I live in the sticks and drive electric cars every day.  There's a few chargers dotted around. Like thousands. https://t.co/oTwsiNO0JP
@rmt_1982 @W92Baj @BBCRadioLondon Always worth checking @zap_map to see how many chargers there are in the UK
@B_McBeardface @Mandiesymms @BBCRadioLondon I agree, but I'd also like to point out I didn't buy a new car until I was 48 years old. I always bought 2nd hand, which is a huge market and 2nd hand EV's is rapidly growing. Plenty around for well under £15k
@au_tom_otive @FullyChargedDan @BBCRadioLondon @BBCRadio4 I was trying not to refer directly to the Zipcar investment, balance.... LOL, but I think we're certainly going to see a marked increase in urban car sharing.
@MisterMark34 @BBCRadioLondon Having visited America on many occasions I witnessed a great many men (Americans) in electric cars that don't go vroom, they just go faster and cost less money to run. So maybe overcome your conditioning. The Vroom sound represents a massive waste of energy
@Mandiesymms @BBCRadioLondon May I ask how much is 'affordable?'
If this is only vaguely accurate it's a huge, national disgrace. https://t.co/cekjb5omz9
@sitoyne @BBCRadioLondon Interesting observation about change in tone of BBC. News editor now extremeist right winger, BBC now very anti electric cars, renewables, very pro fracking and rabidly pro Brexit, they have become mouthpiece of extreme right wing views in terms of news output
just about to start on @BBCRadioLondon
@v8gaz @BBCRadioLondon Yeah, okay, the survey didn't ask about diesel, I added that for dramatic effect :-)
Anyone in London, I think I'm on @BBCRadioLondon in about 20 minutes talking about a report commissioned by the BBC, which proves almost no one, ever, wants to buy an electric car.  Ever, no matter what. They all want to stick with diesel. Should be a bit of fun
@Carpervert OMG, noooo!! I can't wait to see. LOLz.
This is very good news. Let’s hope other manufacturers follow JLR’s lead. Make it simple. https://t.co/8OlKoCDcnk
@Kandiceirene I think you might need to seek professional help ma’am. 😉
@morgana11oge @FrasSmith China installed more solar PV last year than have ever been installed in human history. They literally doubled global solar in 1 year, so yes coal, but not for long.
Or indeed, if you insist on buying a big ass car, make sure it’s 100% electric https://t.co/WbOskDRrp3
Trumpypants looking less impressive this morning https://t.co/sXiBDIfl3z
@CaffandMac @fosgoodwood Great to meet you too and can’t wait to see everything you’re doing
While Trump dumps on the USA and Brexitshambles ties us all in knots, this: https://t.co/3qtHN37TxC
For those interested in the rapid demise of the world we used to live in (a slightly dysfunctional liberal democracy) this analysis of the recent tweets from trump’s account is baffling and chilling https://t.co/VWBG5Ba85r
In case you missed them during a busy weekend of sun, sport, Goodwood etc, here are another bunch of talks from #FullyChargedLive  https://t.co/YJcG6AS052
@NevilleStClair I can't begin to understand what you're trying to say, or indeed what you're trying to argue.
@The_PlugSeeker @Tesla @FullyChargedShw I'll try again. @Carpervert has had a drive, episode coming soon. Amazing what a missing letter can do :-)
@The_PlugSeeker @Tesla @FullyChargedShw Yes, @Carpervert has had a dive, episode coming soon.
@NevilleStClair I don't try and promote a racist, tribalist bully who is supports dictators, tyrants and bigots the world over, so no, I'm not like morgan
@wozzerwozzer27 I deliberately didn't tag him because I don't want to give him the benefit of any attention.
@MuddlyTalkerF1 @fr1endy85 @Tesla Good question. ‘Frontbehälter’? ‘Frontlager’?
I don’t follow him, I don’t watch him on telly, but this piers morgan bloke is a predictable, reactionary little prick isn’t he.
@d_lyrium @UK_SolarEnergy I’m guessing that’s the reason. The Southwest has multiple solar farms and high level of rooftop installations
@MuddlyTalkerF1 @fr1endy85 @Tesla In the USA a boot is called a trunk. So a frunk is a front trunk. Many UK Tesla owners call it a froot
@DuncanForrester came to see the Polestar today, very impressive. Had very good chat with Pia Wendirff. Hope to see more Polestar goodness soon
@McCons @JaguarUKPR I’ve been at your stand for ages, with Ian Callum. Had a lovely cup of tea. Thanks. See you soon.
Quite busy at #Goodwood but I had a short guided tour of the @Tesla #Model3 and I really like it. https://t.co/phVdMFULUn
I’m just updating my status. Today I will mostly be sitting in traffic waiting to get into #GoodwoodFestivalofSpeed LOL. Makes you ponder the wisdom of the car as a means of mass transit
Today I will be mostly at #GoodwoodFOS and it’s quite sunny
@Salvato231Janet Aaaaaand blocked.
@Salvato231Janet I can beat you on the pathetic immaturity stakes. I don't believe you exist, therefore you are less than nothing. A vacuum.
@Salvato231Janet Just skimmed through your boringly predictable, knee jerk reactionary tweets. Yawn. Thankfully you're in a tiny minority, you have rights because the majority of us are so tolerant of your bigoted intolerance. LOL
Tennis is over for today, there's probs some kind of footy happening, but either way, have a look at the latest episodes of #FullyChargedShow Talks from the Live show last month https://t.co/YJcG6AS052
@alasdairpage Good idea, yes, it's about time we did something like that.
@Salvato231Janet That's a very funny picture. It makes us all laugh.
An amazing moment. https://t.co/6PhMFBEYn0
No doubt I’ve done this wrong, but Fullychargedshow has an IGTV account that I’ve started posting to, just ridden a Gocycle up a big hill and waffled a bit. https://t.co/cPxD0wsjn4
@blackmore_s @Patreon @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert @InkSharkman Thank you sir! Much appreciated.
@cornsie No other leader from anywhere in the world, including very dodgy regimes has ever been so arrogant, rude and plain ignorant as this self important orange blimp. Trump walked in front of a very old woman without a 2nd thought. Loads of footage of the moment from different angles
Talks at #FullyChargedLive were very popular, although due to crowd size quite hard to hear. The next 5 talks are on this playlist.. Generating heat and Power at Home Enabling the next Tesla What the Watt? Electrifying EV classics Q&amp;A with Bobby &amp; Jonny https://t.co/YJcG6AS052
@SimonZerafa Heavens to Betsy I would never mute you sir. I only mute when under direct aggressive assault from gun nuts and Trumpypants fanatics.
@DougRDNaylor I know. Really remarkable and revealing.
The next batch of talks from #FullyChargedLive are available. Electrifying classic cars EV 101 Generating heat and power at home And more. https://t.co/YJcG6AS052
@ScottArbs It's not overlooked, it's being very closely monitored, unlike the oil industry that has historically made an incredible mess for a fuel source that can only be used once.
@SimonZerafa I realise your response was light hearted, but it is the standard response when anyone suggests a tech based solution to a problem. "Well, that won't work because people will go out at night with a paintbrush and mess things up.' Immediate 100% negative response. :-)
@RantyHighwayman A long battery powered autonomous bus that requires some paint on the road and minimal infrastructure, yes.
Wonderful collection of snaps https://t.co/2FSKtgwEUc
excellent idea https://t.co/EWvqPWUt2w
@Bluesmachine100 If you mean this episode then no, that was the upgrade I had done last year. It's been amazing. https://t.co/TEncbIYHpX
Excellent, that's very uplifting to read today. Thanks https://t.co/ckL9Zg3TTB
@RobTrenale I try not to but every now and then, I have an embarrassing leak.
@earthgiant @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert It's in the works. Check out 'Milk and More.'
LOL. Nice. https://t.co/kQrBNUON52
@DomHeinz We are seriously working on it. D'you think many people would come along?
@Yorkie71 @Radlein Well, it's a rough guess. My follower count went from somewhere around 148k to 144k so with my maths skills, that's around 4k.
Wow, I had over 4,000 little bots following me here on the Twitters. They will be sadly missed. Bye bye  my little bot pals.
@Ship_Driver I'm very aware that some Americans are fanatical supporters of your president, but statistically not the majority. The lower tax/booming economy thing is ultra short term, blinkered and doomed to fail, but please carry on.
@mvmoxford Blimey. I didn’t notice that.
I’m in london for this. https://t.co/SlvRLlPP9v
@mwt2008 @FullyChargedShw @heatpolicyrich @FullyChargedDan @wasteheatuser @helloheatpumps Good idea. I’ll add it to the list.
Okay, sounds like it wasn’t the orange one in the 7 ton armoured limo. That was just his motorcade. Wish I could have taken a pic of the massive tech support - armoured truck with a big black dome on the roof at the tail of the massive cavalcade. #Thunderbirds
Worth remembering that most Americans are as embarrassed by Trump as most Brits are of Johnson, Rees Mogg and flakey old Frarage.
Probably 30 vehicles. Motorcycle cops miles ahead. Huge queue behind. On their way to Blenheim #TrumpVisitUK
Just saw a massive motorcade. #TrumpUKVisit M40 new Tetsworth https://t.co/fJLn2WynWR
@caterinasimspon @FullyChargedDan Don't worry, it makes me laugh and it's increasingly rare. Public attitudes to EV's has changed dramatically over the last few years. You'll be fine.
@au_tom_otive @James_McKemey @Tim_Oldland @CrackedW_Screen @ajpbradley And what he said. And I love the term bunkum.
@James_McKemey @Tim_Oldland @au_tom_otive @CrackedW_Screen @ajpbradley What he said
@caterinasimspon @FullyChargedDan I have to say I get zero abuse on the street when I'm in an electric car. I get my share on Twitter for being an 'elitist celebrity living in my eco bubble of smug middle class privilege' but that would still happen if I drove a massive diesel SUV.
I’m trying to be a good dad and sit in front of the telly while the football is on. Although I suppose I’m not concentrating on the action that much cos I’m writing this. I am admiring their fitness though. They’re all running around a lot.
I admit I might be a bit odd. My Mrs and the Dort are very excited and getting ready to watch some large sporting event, I'm cooking and cleaning ups the kitchen. Do I need counselling? @CCfunkandsoul thinks so :-)
@grahamtriggs I was a bit surprised to see those tweets. Big announcement tomorrow. I'm saying nothing, you hear me, nothing!
Very excited about this announcement. https://t.co/zyBWwDW6Kz
@ManMadeMoon Very funny. Thanks :-)
@ManMadeMoon No we didn't, they've been up for two whole days. Goduh!  Is there some sort of footballist activity taking place?
@nigelwickenden @FullyChargedShw @DaleVince @ecotricity Spooky, we are discussing this very topic right now. Hopefully the same weekend (1st weekend in June) at Silverstone. We're just awaiting confirmation that we have full access to the entire place
Lovely David Mackay is used again and again to justify nuclear, but Dan makes important points https://t.co/Q6wPqe7IG8
The talks we presented at #FullyChargedLive were 'fascinating' 'inspirational' 'entertaining' according to people attending. Here's the first 4. https://t.co/GZh4y6TiQW
@greatbigbadger Sorry, my confusion. This video: https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
@sidatkins @FullyChargedDan Very interesting
The first 4 talks from this year's #FullyChargedLive show. Definitely worth a look. More coming soon. https://t.co/GZh4y6TiQW
@chrisratcliff @au_tom_otive Just catching up and realised how far off I was with the Yorkshire reference. Duuuuur. E-Up! is a brilliant little car, as long as VW will sell you one.
@au_tom_otive You've got me, G-Wiz?
@thehydrogenans I'm not sure why you're saying this now, in relation to the talks in the playlist? I don't think anyone says 'hydrogen is NOT the answer' in these talks
@au_tom_otive Not the electric camper van?
@au_tom_otive Twizzy
Have a brief break from Westminster meltdowns, chaos, resignations and political fumbling by watching some amazing talks from #FullyChargedLIVE 2018 https://t.co/GZh4y6TiQW
The first 4 talks we held at #FullyChargedLIVE are available now. Range Anxiety! Fully Charged Home. EV 101 The Global Shift. https://t.co/GZh4y6TiQW
@NatalinasJewels Wait what? I don't pay VED on either Tesla or Leaf. Is that because they don't have any range extenders? I did not know you could get £20 VED on a blooming' diesel! I'm so ignorant of diesels, no wonder there's so many about!
Just reading the Department for Transport paper, "The Road to Zero -next steps toward cleaner road transport.' Very interesting, will report about it on #FullyChargedShow but slightly overshadowed today by cataclysmic government #BrexitShambles
@BobTheSkutter @MerseyMal @ruskin147 Here's one solution from Urban Electric London, retractable street chargers.  https://t.co/RaJF5FEu5U also @ubitricity lamp post sockets.
Just released, the first 4 talks from #FullyChargedLive  https://t.co/GZh4y6TiQW
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament Also, while you're busy twisting Prof Mackay's words (it was actually 'Britain is ONE of the darkest countries') you said 'THE darkest country' so you hate solar, that's fine, don't put any on your roof. The rest of us are busy saving money.
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament While I had huge respect and admiration for much of what David Mackay said, he was very wrong about solar. Since he said that (10+ years ago) the cost of solar has dropped by around 70% and it's more efficient. I generate 4.8 megawatt hours a year from solar.
@ClairePayne @DannyJohnJules @CCfunkandsoul @normanlovett1 @Hat Happy birthday young ma'am. Have a lovely day.
LOL https://t.co/U1qKEE3Bhx
There's a whole heap of #FullyChargedLive talks coming later today. Had a very positive reaction to them on @Patreon so really hoping people enjoy them. Stay tuned, as they used to say on television in the 1950's
This, I have to say, is beyond mind boggling. Sometimes it's very hard not to pass judgement on human behaviour. https://t.co/V3wolQMMbI
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament Oh boy, I'm just seeing your older tweets. You actually said the UK is "the darkest country in the world.' Sorry, I thought I was discussing this with a rational, intelligent person.
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament The idea is for new built, affordable homes with built in solar, insulation and energy saving systems, not some middle class twat like me retrofitting on existing building. Find out more before you stridently use crap arguments to defend 'normal people.'
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament The sort of people I'm thinking about will be able to move into new built affordable homes in Neath, outside Swansea. We're making a show about the project. They cost no more to build than regular affordable homes but will have heat/light costs 70% cheaper.
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament And who are 'you people?' Who are they. Who are you, are you not 'you people' too? Such a lazy, reactionary, old left stance.
@davey1233 @myGridGB @UKParliament That is the most ill informed, counter productive reaction, it makes homes for ordinary people much cheaper to live in, rather than paying extra money for light &amp; heat to very rich companies.
I have experienced 52°C near Alice Springs in Australia in 1990. It was a dry heat, but OMFG, it was not very relaxing.
@SparksF1 An excellent high speed, no-data-check response.  4th listing, -- Iran: 53°C I know Tblisi is in Georgia. I chose the hottest listing.
Just in case you're moaning about the heat, it's a bit warmer in Iran at then moment. https://t.co/H8TeiIcVuM
@mariamcerlane That is the best response I've had today. Is he some kind of football person?
@darren_whiston I won't tell you how many people have sent clips of the opening credits of Alpha Papa. It's quite a few.
It's Roachford, that's who I was trying to remember. Roachford Roachford Roachford
@Model3Owners I agree that Living Colour are amazing but I was trying to remember Roachford.  https://t.co/rVF4ZEbYcd…
@skeewiff It wasn't a quiz. I couldn't remember the name of the band, or Andrew Roachford, or any of their songs. It happens sometimes so my clues were very vague
Okay, I now know that describing Roachford as 'hard rock' was a classic error which is clearly offensive to some aficionados of the true hard rock genre and I apologise from the bottom of my platform boots
@sneddsdead @21stCmilkFloat Shows how stuffed my memory is. I was thinking late 1980's when I introduced Roachford in Cambridge, maybe it was early '90's, but not later than that
@MitchBenn Thanks Mitch. I remember them as being a very friendly bunch and Andrew was a very nice chap.
@evmanuk @fosgoodwood That's very kind, if I go it'll be on the Sunday. Hope to see you there.
@Warmaudiokingy I'm very confident I wasn't thinking of Thin Lizzy. I was trying to remember the name Roachford. The Twitters responded in doves. Wonderful.
@MannyJazzcats I knew whatever designation in the musical universe I chose, I would get criticism. Took longer than I expected.
@evmanuk @fosgoodwood I think I am, just arranging things.
I stood on the side of the stage and watched them play this. Awfully loud but they were brilliant live. https://t.co/N2my4NL1Oe
I know my twitter stream is now going to be a long list of  Roachford?  Tweets, but that's fine.
And yes, one song was used brilliantly in Alpha Papa https://t.co/1BETRZ8nnq
I have been trying to remember their name as a mental exercise. I knew that data was in my sludgy brain box somewhere. I failed. But lovely Twitterererers helped me!
Roachford! Yessss! Thank you!! I love the Twitters.
Going mildly insane due to memory issues. Can anyone name a briefly popular late 80's rock band with a brilliant black lead singer. Quite hard rock, I did a gig with them in Cambridge around 1987-88. Name might end in '-ford.'
@RetailLowdown Thank you, glad you enjoyed it, there's loads more in the series.  https://t.co/rlBaoYNKL6
Excellent stuff, well worth a read. https://t.co/NTOqZ8g5Jt
Here's a story about tech development which allows us to use more of the energy we waste, which is a lot. https://t.co/52pLGt1Qdx
Goodness me there are a lot of pedants with not much to do on a lovely Saturday morning. Get out and have a walk in the sunshine.  And also, yes of course, after cost of car, panels, inverter, installation, the fuel, the actual fuel is actually free. Unlike fossil fuels.
@weezmgk @CharlieSanga I already have an electric lawnmower, but I don't feel guilty about that.
@BarnsfordFerny @weezmgk I'm very happy to say I have no idea what you're on about. Some crazy crackpot nonsense you read on some utterly bonkers web page from 2006?
@Charmantides "You eco heads.' What, pray, does that even mean. What a miserable angry world you must live in. I made no comment about nuclear, or carbon, but you go ahead. Jump to literally demented conclusions. LOL
@CharlieSanga I do, I'm greedy. I have a model S and a Nissan Leaf. I know, it's wrong and I feel bad.
@LuisFCorreia Good question, I'd have to manage it carefully, (it's charging from solar right now by the way) say 80 kWh, I produce about 35 kWh a day ATM so 2 and a bit days. But in reality I add about 50-60 miles a day to Tesla and Leaf and run the house off solar.
Old man fail with minimal energy consequences and 1st world problems Just got back from shops and discovered I forgot to get Olive Oil. Now I've got to go again but because my #NissanLeaf is literally 100% solar powered ATM it's free.
@nuclearforus Hang on Lucas, I thought you were relatively intelligent and well informed, bhe New York Post! Seriously?  The least trusted news source in the USA according to literally dozens of surveys, a Murdoch 'newspaper' with an ultra right-wing agenda. Quelle surprise.
@EVEC_MK @au_tom_otive @FullyChargedShw Isn't that wonderful. Thanks for sharing, I've had a long day. That's cheered me up.
@Mr__Gus @NissanUK I can honestly say my Parcel shelf has never rattled.
@clifferosion Been there, done that :-) Back in 2014  https://t.co/CaYwNxCUHE
Having a look around #Shell #makethefuture event. Very impressive https://t.co/Ug1KOilJYV
@shortword The first 4 will be available later today. We’ll then release the next 12 in batches of 4 talks over the next 2 weeks. #FullyChargedLIVE
This is happening so fast, and why? Because it's cheaper, faster and more reliable.  #energytransition  #cleancoalLOL #PruittOut https://t.co/gg2FEUOe5x
Of course whoever Trumpy pants drags out of the slime ridden ultra conservative reactionary swamp will be just as bad, but still. I'm LOL-in for a couple of minutes
Scott Pruitt, the man who constantly sued the EPA to protect companies that wanted the freedom to pollute, who then went on to head the EPA has, LOL, resigned due to endless scandals. Laugh in his smug, shiny face.
@Carpervert Oh you big softy sir. Very touching and you are a lucky fellow.
And of course, hyper-interesting https://t.co/tKKTRkqU1j
And again. Interesting https://t.co/JEwGCGXuWb
Interesting https://t.co/ItCfkmKJZL
@mattjcan I accept you might have tweeted this as a deliberate way to goad intelligent people with access to facts. I’m being kind. If you believe it then it’s shameful stupidity. I’ve screen shot it for later reference. Comically moronic.
Tragically unsurprising https://t.co/C36ABv434k
New media moan https://t.co/JkrJE7i23G
Yeah, don’t big up @InkSharkman too much. I can’t talk to him directly now, I have to talk to ‘his people.’  But thanks, and annoyingly he shot and edited it. Damn him. https://t.co/XW3HkAFDQa
Sadly there are few living people who remember what life was like before the NHS&gt; My mother's memory went back that far. "It was terrible, people just died.' was her take. Happy Birthday NHS. https://t.co/IV2W6S3wDY
Much discussion in the comments about Ultra/Super capacitors, we have an excellent and highly intelligent and indeed opinionated audience on #FullyChargedShow  https://t.co/52pLGt1Qdx
Worth a read https://t.co/tgV3QhV3j8
@MarkHoldstock It took me a moment to work out the source of your comment. Estonia, Scandinavian country, cold, solar. Got it. Yes, it's to do with daylight, they have loads over quite a short summer, very little over a very long winter so not ideal.
"Sumptuous camerawork"  "Great Interview"  "Fascinating Tech"  Just some of the comments on latest #FullyChargedShow  https://t.co/52pLGt1Qdx
@markwoodward82 It was me and hi, you don't need to be shy but I remember the class of kids, looked like you had your hands full. And I did get home eventually, hope you did too.
There we go. To find out more, watch Taavi show me around his amazing factory in the latest #FullyChargedShow https://t.co/6R1Eb9t8b2
@skennedy853 Wow, I truly didn't know that existed!
What is an Ultra capacitor? What is curved graphene. We went to Estonia to find out. Latest #FullyChargedShow https://t.co/52pLGt1Qdx
@louise_wise @hally_andrew That is so obtuse and twisted I can only respond with a sigh.
@stuandthecrew That the most intelligent non question I’ve ever read sir.
Figures. https://t.co/M7522DlEs7
Really hope so. https://t.co/KjBp2OuREX
Colin McKerracher from Bloomberg New Energy Finance talking lithium ion battery costs. Manufacturing cost in 2010. $1,000 per kWh capacity. Now, $105 per kWh. That’s disruptive tech in action.
Thanks for the link. Live stream from Oxford EV summit https://t.co/MnstJ84dw2
@oxfordsolarpv Wow. That’s great to hear.
Some very strident criticism for oil and automotive companies from Greg Archer (Clean Vehicles and Energy Director, Transport and Environment) Big car companies spend on promoting EV’s. 1% of total PR budget.
I’m at the Oxford EV Summit. Fascinating to hear people at the top of various energy and automotive companies discussing the inevitability of the transition https://t.co/vENGA1t0Az
This is a heartbreaking story. Maybe we need to think about dumping this old technology. https://t.co/eqR4ZZyxpc
@rinksters @mynameisharry @jaxd38 @sreezin Excellent. I want it to be all MY fault. LOL
@missfoxx12 That's the best response ever. LOL
@tuckeratlarge Well sadly you used the rabidly nationalist term 'remoaner' so that doesn't bode well. I'm not trying to change anything, I'm merely suggesting it isn't working out too well. Before the Tory referendum no one, including 'remoaners' had a clue what leaving would entail.
@jaxd38 @MikeTonge Here's the important question, do you still think it's right?
@totally_cars @FullyChargedShw Totally agree, if you're going to spend 20-30 minutes somewhere during a long journey, it's needs to be a pleasant somewhere, with wifi, nice loo, wholesome food. And that coffee stuff.
@missfoxx12 Yes, they had made up their own minds, I'm not saying they didn't, but this unholy mess is of their making and now they're all whining asking everyone to help out.
@QwestNorfolk @InkSharkman @AutoTrader_UK Yes, we must do this!
@jaxd38 @rinksters @sreezin It is everyone's mess in this country, brought on by a failing political party irrevocably splitting apart and using this absurd binary choice as a way of trying to heal the rift. So yes, we're all affected, by the looks of things, very negatively
@BobAndersson I don't think matters what I believe. Those who voted, for whatever reason, to leave now have the responsibility for the consequences. And I think it's becoming very apparent they're not that good.
@ManMadeMoon Oh poo, sorry, I did see that but in my tragic fantasy world you'd just signed a multi $billion deal to make Moon2
@rinksters @sreezin Don't waste your breath. I'm not interested.  It's your mess not mine, grow up, deal with it.
@ManMadeMoon I don't know what 'this film' is, but congrats anyway sir. Exciting.
@sreezin @PhilipMarshall1 Grabbing at straws by any chance?
@rinksters Oh the joy, as the whole sorry mess that is the Tory referendum starts to unravel before your eyes.  I'm not denying anything, you won, grow up, deal with the mess.
@Shappy113 @KateFantom @FullyChargedDan What ever develops it's definitely not one key. It's a big bunch of interconnected smart keys. V2V could be very useful, but I think very occasionally. Helping out your Uncle who forgot to charge when you're at a family picnic in the park.
@sreezin Oh yes, I'm livid, fuming, I'm in a clench fisted rage about it, although possibly more so about the whole notion of the absurd, multi £billion waste of the entire Tory referendum.
@pluginadventure Wow, have a great trip.
@therealjpster @aminorjourney Dammit, I glanced at them, the thing is these comments make me laugh now, with the chilling background reminder of common levels of ignorance around electric vehicle technology, materials and systems
@leightransfer @Shell_UKLtd I've copied and saved your tweet because it's a list of anxieties that's a fascinating insight into the human mind. Souring the seabed is a great image.
@Shappy113 @KateFantom @FullyChargedDan There have been experiments charging one car from another, what is far more useful/interesting is vehicle to grid technology, I think this will have a major role.
But the really big shock today is the announcement that 'Vote Leave' which was run by Johnson and Gove look very much like they have broken the law.  I mean, surely not, they are such trustworthy and decent men who only have the interests of ordinary people in mind. LOL.
I'm very happy to hear the results of the football match last night in Russia, and today is Independence Day in the USA.   So happy football joy to all my footie loving pals and happy Independence day to all my American pals.
@McCons @JaguarUKPR @JaguarUK @IanCallum @AutoExpress @SteveFowler @Tesla Congrats to the team. Very well deserved
Just been out for a bike ride. There’s no one on the roads. Is there something going on?  Where is everyone?
@MrRoryReid #hashtag #crazy #dude
@MrRoryReid Thanks f0r that Rory, I keep forgetting it's now called the Taycan. That's a helpful reminder.
Of course you can still pledge for 'Some Old Bloke' after midnight tonight and you'll still get a shiny 1st edition signed copy, but it won't have your name in the back. Hope that makes sense. https://t.co/zOBrILCWBt
"Some Old Bloke" is about to go off to the printers. My hopefully amusing @unbounders memoir coming out later this year. If you're of a mind, you can still get your name in the back. Until midnight tonight!!  Hurry, while stocks last! Or something. https://t.co/zOBrILCWBt
@yanquetino @Carpervert This is the first I've heard of it. Was going to Goodwood but other stuff happened.
Great news, #Dundee electric car charge hubs. https://t.co/jTjHhf1Z76
@goinginafield It's capitalism in America. Kind of unclear what the story was saying. I wouldn't call it direct Tesla bashing but the author was clearly trying to do put a gentle Guardian boot in.
@Downesegg @iAncheer I do have one, @Gocycle  It's brilliant and we're making a Gocycle special for #fullychargedshow
@Uptgyal So gorgeous. "Be careful dad!" Love it.
@jonginn I'm sure as in other areas they are in complete disarray, however they have committed a large amount of money to encourage the uptake of EV's so no. What we'll start to see I suspect is another form of road pricing for EV's due to the impossibility of taxing the fuel.
@Richard28861 We don't need to rush. 15 to 20 years if it goes to plan. More like 30-35. It's a pre-crippled white elephant
@denham81 Thank you, very glad you enjoyed it and I've just been replying to a load of emails today as the project very slowly grinds forward. But yes, we'll definitely do an update when stuff's advanced, but on #FullyChargedShow
@AndyG131 @realDonaldTrump I did see that and experienced mild feelings of pleasure surging around my nethers. Aaaaaahhh.
@LubertTheLou @Colin_Evison Ahh, you could be right. Blimey, that's too complicated for my tiny brain.
@LindsayPB @PetrosofSparta I think it can be argued that wind energy in particular, does not produce any waste. 100% of a wind turbine can, and indeed is reused, solar more problematic but nothing compared to nuclear waste. And who pays to look after it? The generating companies? I don't think so.
@LindsayPB @PetrosofSparta Contrary to some assumptions, I'm not rabidly anti nuclear, but I've visited Sellafield a couple of times, met the amazing engineers/scientists who work there, and that's the bit I'm concerned about. France: https://t.co/mowUcoaT4w
@Colin_Evison None of it is from domestic solar. That only shows up as lower demand. I've used 0,01kw of grid electricity today.
@Almighty_CRJ Probs about 1 and a half tidal lagoons, but then they run 24/7 and last 100 years and don't leave a mountain of deadly waste for our grandchildren to look after
@mcsmik No, residential solar only shows up as lower demand. This is large installations, there's also multiple GW of domestic on over 1 million UK houses
@HerbieGreen Very true, but there are plenty of people who still say 'solar doesn't work in this country.' Well, it does. 8.51GW worth.
The comments on the most recent #FullyChargedShow ep are varied and wise as usual, with a lot of skepticism about BPchargemster. I just saw this: https://t.co/4sDn5lmwFS https://t.co/2EU5JApYma
@PetrosofSparta Is it though? Really. I mean that's the standard opinion trotted out, but technology is changing/developing so fast that by the time Hinkley even nears completion the picture will have changed dramatically.
The for once interesting story in yesterday's Mail start's to unravel a bit. https://t.co/WhU7unqGzK
Nice, but I suppose not that surprising today. Oh hang on, 8.51GW. That's 2 and a half Hinkley Point C's going flat out. That's impressive. https://t.co/Xx9j3kDkUM
@keith__johnston Wow, what is it with seeking alpha. I know I've been portraying a robot for 30 years, but I can't get past the 'are you a robot section.'
@PJChapman74 @Durgemeister I'm ambivalent about the whole sorry mess. No one is going to come out of this debacle feeling happy, I can only judge from a historical perspective, nationalism of any kind, from any country, ends up being a very ugly problem.
@GadgetGav @PrivateEyeNews I agree it's confusing, but there's one caveat@PrivateEyeNews hasn't covered. The life expectancy of the lagoon is 100 years, zero waste management, zero after-cost. Life of Hinkley 35 years. Massive after-costs, truly colossal, 1000's of years of waste management.
@toby1kanobi I'm not going to pretend I understand the tangled web of hard left/soft left machinations embedded in your response. "Brexit, like communism is a red herring." Blimey, you know how to write 'em but it's all beyond me. I don't even know what FBPE is
@bertisfantastic Sorry, yes, of course, mustn't forget the important stuff.
What a lovely, trustworthy bunch of chaps with the best interests of ordinary people in mind at all times. Ashcroft, Rees-Mogg, Redwood. Names that will go down in history. Horaah. Horaah https://t.co/2xQSShW1pX
@RumsfeldBall @keith__johnston @GoUltraLowNottm That was an error on my part, or possibly a misunderstanding from the journalist, who was lovely. I did try to explain that it would never be used 'to run the country' merely to cover peaks in demand but I suppose that's a far more complex concept.
@5arcen @r5haw @ecarstrading @ChargemasterPlc @BP_plc @bobbylew @FullyChargedShw I'm not a scientist or electro-chemical engineer, but I have yet to hear about "some type of electricity not available from your home." Any scientists out there? How many types of electricity are there?
@Skyamoeba @r5haw @ecarstrading @ChargemasterPlc @BP_plc @bobbylew @FullyChargedShw There is a new company called Sono motors in Germany that's making a car covered in solar panels which helps charging. However to drive a car powered by solar PV you'd need a roof space half the size of a tennis court which might make parking a bit of a struggle.
@eduardonarvaez We REALLY want to come and see what's happening in Costa Rica. One day, maybe we'll make it. Heard a lot about your amazing country earlier this year.
@bpavlotzky @Oye_Bugger_Lugs I don't think an educated, intelligent response is going to be much help in this instance, but thanks for trying :-)
Costa Rica! https://t.co/9R0H2dDcAc
@r5haw @ecarstrading @ChargemasterPlc @BP_plc @bobbylew @FullyChargedShw Only just seen this. Brilliant bit of photoshop and very interesting. My, how fast things are changing.
@8bitadc It's an issue, no doubt about it. It needs to be harmonised to make it frictionless for users, but there are still many misconceptions about public charging. A big one being you'll use it less than you think if you can charge at home.
Just writing something about misinformation and electric cars. This says a lot. https://t.co/d3Sdmbg7Pi
@StubCrouch @Carpervert Funny. Never heard of this taxi before, I wonder if any are left around? @Carpervert could turn it into a dragster over a couple of weekends

@PinkeJohn Seriously, I don't know what you're talking about :-) #baffled
@PinkeJohn Once again, I've no idea what this refers to. Has there been some announcement about diesel engines made in the UK&gt; I've been in the garden.
@PinkeJohn I'm sorry, I've no idea what you're talking about. Did Danny Dyer say "1 in every 3 Diesel Engines "in the world" are made in the UK."
@mrethancox_ @Martha_Gill Without question, right with you sir.
@PaulDJohnston @netflix @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @JoeBaguley @alexhansford Nice, I like it :-)
@mrethancox_ @Martha_Gill I would gently like to point out that the first Tory referendum fits the same bill. Absurdly distorted reasons for leaving with no plan, no alternative and a massive, unsolvable mess to keep one tatty political party in power. The whole thing is a massive yawn fest.
What an extraordinary story, and how important we remember him and are very aware of history https://t.co/6KG0ocggDq
@smeg___head The drawing my son did is prominently featured in the book, but not on the cover.
@AndyNess9 @victoriasaxecob I'm an ordinary person, I live in the normal ordinary world, I'm also aware that the birth rate is very low in the UK and the majority of people are old duffers like me. Using the term 'ordinary people' is very suspicious, who are ordinary people and where do they live?
@AndyNess9 @victoriasaxecob I'm glad you like me as a person, and I'm also aware that many consultant physicians, nurses, pharmacists, GPs, radiographers, engineers, scientists and construction workers are 'immigrants' because we actually need them to help run the country. Run it for 'ordinary people'
@sadknob That is a pre-requisite of a namby-pamby-wishy-washy-wet liberal sir :-)
Stunning https://t.co/llr22W5tEp
@victoriasaxecob With the current administration, and the likes of Rees Mogg, Lord Ashcroft, Gove and Johnson in control, there is zero chance of anything resembling a fair wage. Plus they are getting their business' out of UK as fast as they can.
@aussienut01 100% dependent on driving style. If you go easy, gentle acceleration, allow regeneration to slow down, maybe 130 miles on a charge. If you thrash it, late hard braking, max acceleration, much less.
My next book, 'Some Old Bloke' is in its final stages. Comes out in Oct-Nov. Next Tuesday, July 3rd, @unbounders close the page so, no pressure, but if you want a copy with your name in the back, just saying. https://t.co/zOBrILCWBt
@TimSpgolf @Carpervert Corbyn is a rabidly pro Brexit, so that might have something to do with it :-)
@nuclearforus Good morning Lucas, off you go again on your comedy rants with no basis in science or fact. LOL.
@victoriasaxecob That is such a boring, ignorant response. You destroyed any possible validity by using the tired old term luvvies. Get over it, it's a mess. Brexit was a bad idea with a bad outcome for the vast majority of ordinary people as everyone is starting to realise.
@richyD92534636 Thank you, much appreciated. Glad you enjoy it, there's loads more to come.
@techp0sion @FreakyFwoof If renewable and storage systems are fitted as part of the build, not added as an afterthought, then cost increase is between 5 and 10% on affordable housing (cheapest per sq meter)
I never had any interest in Danny Dyer until I saw this. It made me roar laughing. https://t.co/XyYZYpFrnb
Yesterday's solar and the past week's energy generation. With 5.5 kW solar and a @Tesla powerwall. I've also added 300+ miles to 2 electric cars in the past week.  Of course it's not like this in winter, I will do an episode about 12 months usage at the end of this year https://t.co/WSM64dnYb9
@FreakyFwoof No they don't and it's a complete and utter scandal. We've just filmed the start of a report on a housing project where all the new houses will have solar and batteries built in, it could happen, it should happen but the building industry is still living in 1972.
While I'm on the subject... https://t.co/tQ2xhXkzR4
Excellent. https://t.co/ESghwX5ItZ
Controversial, challenging, optimistic, doom laden. It's all in the latest #FullyChargedShow breaking news episode. Big oil and big volts https://t.co/2EU5JApYma
#FullyChargedShow breaking news. BP buy Chargemaster, creating #BPChargemaster https://t.co/2EU5JApYma
@r5haw Believe me, I've suggest this very solution every chance I get. They're definitely thinking about it.
@Davis_404 Who knows how much they'll charge but currently, unlike traditional fuelled vehicles, EV drivers have a choice. 90% of charging is done at home. They have to be realistic and competitive or no one will use them.
This is worth checking if you drive an electric or ultra low emission vehicle. Made me have a mild panic attack but I'm up to date... phew. https://t.co/9njLDzvbIa
@advandermeer @FullyChargedShw You need to ask @Shell_UKLtd  I hope so, they certainly have big plans and the charger we featured is being used constantly
Fully Charged Breaking News!  It's a 1st! https://t.co/2EU5JApYma
@Ian_Cull Thank you, a very precise description
Ba-dhum-tish https://t.co/NouKOmt85W
An excellent addition to the already excellent @zap_map app. https://t.co/Up0CyBBRb1
@richardslopes83 @FullyChargedShw I've not heard this story, however, the notion that they 'shredded' the batteries is so absurd as to warrant profound skepticism. Why would they shred a really valuable asset?
@Cadrieu Yes. https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
@ibikehorsham @loudmouthman @FullyChargedDan There are a few hundred in London already.
Today I’ve mostly been driving this. #lucky https://t.co/TFTvlVx35r
@checkweightman Simple answer. No. not even remotely accurate.
@ChrisSamsDad When I was a kid we were told nuclear power would be 'too cheap to meter.' That didn't work out so well.
If you're in NYC, go and see Christina, she's wonderful. https://t.co/6HWcnE87Ix
I think that's going quite fast. https://t.co/rePXgLyCAG
Sadly not surprised the current frayed and tatty administration has failed to back the brilliant Swansea Tidal Lagoon project. On the other hand they're quite happy to throw warehouse loads of money at a French and Chinese nuclear power plant. Ho hum
@evcarmike @Heitzplay So, the alternative to land based wind generation with zero CO2 is nuclear? With more concrete than ten thousand wind turbines, massive construction costs, a 20 year construction period and then the most expensive electricity ever produced, plus 10,000 years waste management.
@TimesScience I have a Tesla Moddel S. The battery is currently at 100%. Not one electron of that came from the grid (just from solarPV) but the UK grid is cleaner now than it's ever been. This article is spurious nonsense, it's repeatedly been shown to be incorrect.
@DudleydeBeau @mikercameron Will they? I can't imagine why.
@darthdodd @BrianDunning I literally wasted moments of my life reading that statement. And the server farms running Twitter wasted electricity recording and transmitting the data
@MarioTeslaFan Haven't got a clue, more than we hope, and possibly much more due to bizarre trade wars between USA and EU. Hey ho. Jolly times for all.
@Gr33nb0glin @FriendsOScience @Stewy13 So you are believing rabid climate change deniers who post absurd material and yet call themselves "Friends of Science." Massive unashamed LOL.
@nickgbowling @helenczerski I think the inclusion of car related bird deaths is to put the minuscule numbers killed by wind turbines in perspective.
@bobehpearson If you read and accept the vitriol from a certain British Lord (who owns a coal mine) then wind power generates zero energy. After their relatively short life (25 - 30 years) they are dismantled and recycled. The materials are a little less toxic than nuclear waste.
@nickgbowling @helenczerski Yes, 55 million in UK, which is shocking. The figures I quoted were global deaths from this report: https://t.co/1Ppqch0eDH
@Gr33nb0glin The RSPB put a huge net around the base of a hilltop wind turbine near Stroud 12 years ago, left it there for 3 years and in that time they found one dead bird and 2 bats. In 3 years, so yes, it can happen but not very often
@Palo_K1 Without cats there would be 2.41 billion more birds, tall glass buildings, 599 million. None of those figures reveal how many are killed by burning coal/gas and affecting the entire planet. Everything we do has an effect, we must try to use systems that damage less.
@jimskerrett That was me boing a doofus when I first tried Patreon.This is the correct link https://t.co/tjyrjTw1L8
I will obviously have to make an episode about birds and wind turbines at some point. Until then, there's this. https://t.co/NfLWM8b92l
Brilliant point, well made. Bigger is actually safer for birds https://t.co/oblxXQ8NY2
@NewpPaul Can't read the whole thing as it's behind paywall but I got the gist. Same old same old but a lazy and easy rubbish argument that doesn't stand up to any scrutiny. Tragic. @thetimes should do a modicum of research before publishing such dross
Very true https://t.co/BehAau3RdW
@evcarmike @MyEnergiLTD Because a type 2 socket can be used by every electric car on the market,
We hope to do just that at #FullyChargedLive 2019 https://t.co/uB2s1tVicK
And here's the study: https://t.co/1Ppqch0eDH
Just read the classic 'wind turbines kill birds' comment on YouTube. Here are the stats from a 2016 study: Cats  2.41 billion Building Glass  599 million Auto collisions 199 million Power Line collisions 22.8 million Communication Towers 6.6 million Wind Turbines 366,000.
@klonecaid I'm attending the Electric Vehicle FestEVal in Nottingham next weekend, will be asking lots of questions about these topics. https://t.co/QNzIVWizDc
Offshore wind is huge and growing fast, solid state batteries are nearly here, and an old man makes a tragic mistake. All this and more on #FullyChargedShow news https://t.co/NfLWM8b92l
Latest #FullyChargedShow is out. Wind, small waves rubbish trucks, dustbin lorries and EV's with a range of 750 meters! LOLz. https://t.co/NfLWM8b92l
@PeteRamsey I'm sure it's not impossible but electric cars have a lot of software that controls the input, the protect the battery, you need some clever people like @MyEnergiLTD to explain why it's not possible, that's beyond my pay grade
@DaveDooby @ruskin147 @DianeCoyle1859 @ecocars1 According to Gov figures, 60% of UK households have off street parking, so 60% have no excuse
@TuftyDave If there was someone who could do that, they'd be very busy. I know the folks at @jojusolar are very knowledgeable, as are many others. Pico hydro may be out of their remit, I don't know.
@ekulmit @ruskin147 @DianeCoyle1859 @ecocars1 Around 80% drive way less than that during an average week. 140 miles a week is average, so that's one charge per week for most. 60% of UK households have off street parking.
@Daemonyx_ @ruskin147 @DianeCoyle1859 @ecocars1 Seriously, if I was I'd be literally bathing in dirty cash, smoking a big cigar, massive gold watch, laughing all the way to the bank. So no.
@MyEnergiLTD OMG, I can't wait. great news. And an app. You know I love an app :-)
@ruskin147 @DianeCoyle1859 @ecocars1 I agree it's much more of a challenge, I know many people who use an EV in same situation. Also there are now many rapid chargers being installed in traditional fuel stations (garages) and on street charging like @ubitricity but you have to be keen to do it.
I have to mention that during the current weather, I have already added 250 miles of 100% solar power to our Nissan Leaf (multiple charges) courtesy of @MyEnergiLTD Zappi charger. It works so well, just want one with a socket! https://t.co/I5TcdmQxHo
@ruskin147 @DianeCoyle1859 If you have low mileage requirements, (under 300 miles per week) have somewhere off street to park car, electric is the only sensible choice. I've driven over 300,000 miles in EV's, never, ever broken down. And 2nd hand EV's very reasonable now. Check @ecocars1
@ChasHopper I suppose the big difference is you can only use fuel from oil once. A battery has a 20-25 year lifespan, and after that 95+5 of the materials in the battery can be used again
That is utterly bonkers! https://t.co/f8mOqbfpJt
@seanmmitchell @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw Sadly I'm not there, I'm basking in English sunshine, but @Carpervert is lovely and knows much more than me anyway. Hope you have fun!
@tadpies That report has been so thoroughly debunked, Edinburgh University have refuted it, it's not from there and the results are comical, inaccurate and nonsense. Other than that, top marks.
@electrosalmon @ManMadeMoon And then there's 'no infrastructure' and 'it'll melt the grid' and 'we'll need 5 new Hinkley Point C's to charge all these useless cars.' So you're doing a great job, really supporting the struggling and heavily subsidised fossil fuel lobby. Hats off.
@electrosalmon @ManMadeMoon That 'slight exaggeration' is part of the drumbeat of the resistance to change. Keep repeating it, 30 miles range, takes a day to recharge, batteries wear out after 7 weeks.' I hear it all the time. It's very clever. People who don't know believe it. It slows down adoption.
@electrosalmon @ManMadeMoon Being honest, I appreciate your comment but you really need to update your assumptions. You have to go back to the mid 1990's to even find a car that needs to be recharged after 30 miles. My pedal assist bike can do 40 miles on a charge.
The amount of anecdotal evidence is overwhelming that the single biggest impediment to greater adoption of electric vehicles are dealerships who actively try to dissuade people from buying their brand of EV. Staggering ignorance and pro diesel attitudes.
This is going to be an epic episode for @FullyChargedShw   Good luck @Carpervert and @InkSharkman https://t.co/3Ofni1DU0Q
Yes https://t.co/IxrFFn79Pp
@barcabert Looks like it to me.
@sadknob I want to read it.
@thehistoryguy Orisdale Terrace where a bomb fell in 1942 right outside my mum’s house and didn’t explode. Lucky escape.
@dcozzi @WiebeWkkr didn't travel via the USA. Maybe he should come back that way! Just a thought :-)
@AndrewJohnKirby @parapism @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @ManMadeMoon @InkSharkman @sr_edy @helenczerski The majority of our audience is in the 25-34 age bracket, but we're not fashionable, no sudden mass increase in subs and low views (very common)  We get strong consistent subs growth, between 2-3000 a week, and they also watch the show. 2-2.5 million views a month
@ChrisUk10 @DriverPotter @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @railwaymuseum @nnrailway @Gordon_3417 Thank you for that snippet of supreme wisdom. No one thought of that before!!
@JamieGibbon Yes! I'm driving an electric car to Swansea and not eating any beans tonight
When people talk about range anxiety I always want to point them toward Wiebe’s story. Amazing achievement https://t.co/itabLx6GQs
@NovalutionGSi @BlackTopMediaUK @serichards @Carpervert @PaulCowland_ The infrastructure is growing so fast its impossible to keep up. Until you’ve driven one for a week and experienced the fact that it’s not remotely like a traditional fuelled vehicle it’s very hard to explain in Twitter land.
@jerryhat Watch the video, calling other people thick is exactly the opposite of what he, or indeed I am suggestion. The exact opposite.
Not sweaty, SWEARY. I typed sweary! Dammit you vile politically correct autocorrect fascist!
A spot on and very sweaty summation. https://t.co/5sbRAMRYeI
@mickhackney It's a charger in a car park

@markrstoll @EVMaps @The_PlugSeeker @pluginadventure @tveitdal @KateFantom @ecocars1 @She_sElectric @RenaultZoeClub @FullyChargedShw @plugseeker Modern ICE cars are incredibly reliable, long lasting and safe. They are, however, incredibly inefficient and filthy dirty, they are a massive waste of resources and will be looked back on as a truly terrible technology
@markrstoll @EVMaps @The_PlugSeeker @pluginadventure @tveitdal @KateFantom @ecocars1 @She_sElectric @RenaultZoeClub @FullyChargedShw @plugseeker The number of vehicle fires has dropped, thank goodness, but in 2015 in the USA it was still 174,000. All vehicles are complex machines, all vehicles contain energy, there is plenty of historical evidence for gas cars bursting into flames. https://t.co/HDQpLZvOUk
@MsTaken2017 @FullyChargedDan Yes, by far. Keep it up!
@Jack_Harkness_1 No dipping, just popped it straight in my mouth.
@totally_cars I'm very sorry, you are correct, of course the British spelling is neighbours. However, I'm certainly not a respected journalist, far from it.
@Carpervert I’ve wrapped on in cling film especially for you sir.

@levitblanc @NigelPlaner1 and I wrote that together about 22 years ago, I only know that because it was just before my daughter was born.
@tyger_hudgins Phonetically it would be chowp sounding more like grope. Chope grope. Oh dear, this is going downhill fast
@FreakyFwoof Now that would be a very cool challenge. Someone on the shore on a walkie talkie "Left a bit Andre... no, not that much, right a bit.... left... right.... Andre! I said right!!"

@TheFlyingKipper @CCfunkandsoul LOL. Yes, it actually is. Hadn't considered that.
I've got a sneaking suspicion that the bureaucracy involved in generating such a payment is probably greater than £1.36p. Still, I'm not going to say no.

Woohoo! I'm in the money. I admit it, I'm a great big bloated overpaid luvvie living in an exclusive libtard media bubble of insane privilege. Just had a repeat fee for 'Captain Butler' (great series from way back starring @CCfunkandsoul) for...... £1.36p. Boom!
@aminorjourney What I find really worrying is I can't remember doing that. 2012 is only 6 years ago. I remember your massive coffee bucket but I don't remember that drive. Where were we?

Realised this evening that the very frenetic week I've just had has left me fairly high on the knackered-ometer. Plus I now have over a terabyte of video footage to edit from #FullyChargedLIVE  Hoping people who couldn't make it to the event are interested to see it.
A little preview from Fully Charged Live. Loads more coming soon. https://t.co/z7zLUB4FnL
@nuclearforus HAven't seen one of your lovely tweets for a while. Always a gift. Thank you

@ManMadeMoon @theflyinggopro @FullyChargedDan @InsideEVs @Carpervert @helenczerski @FullyChargedShw @algore @CarolineLucas @LeoDiCaprio @aminorjourney @elonmusk just want to add, and this is from the boss of the AA (Automobile Association) in the U.K. who told me they respond to around 2,500 calls a week from people who’ve run out of fuel. Humans are very fallible
@JBdoessound @helenczerski @FullyChargedShw Yes, she will, along with @maddiemoate
To clarify, 90% of my Twitter stream is brilliant, with occasional splurges of unpleasantness. I follow a lot of engineers, scientists, progressive companies and bonkers old comedians I've know for years. And some news feeds, maybe therein lies the problem.
I'm posting positive re-tweets partly because my Tweet stream is, as usual, a torrent of ugliness, bitter recrimination, twisted triple standards, hopeless opposition and of course the B word. Boring? Batshit? Blatant self harm?
Brilliant selection, I've only read 5, I've got some reading to do. https://t.co/rEkHaokQgy

The app the Dort uses is called HUJI. I suppose that's a reference to FUJI. Remember that? Film, in a little canister. Sweet.
@Voyager03 Ours was 8-8-88 which makes it easy to remember
Me and the Mrs went for a walk this evening, pic taken by the dort. 30 years together this year. She's my rock. (the date is fake, some weird app the dort uses to make pics look old') https://t.co/ntVIlC9wC4
@Gormador @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @helenczerski Thank you, and yes, we're very much in need of @helenczerski expertise and knowledge. No offence taken.

Day 2 at #FullyChargedLIVE and it’s getting busy https://t.co/M894WRYm6D
@AlanStainer Yes, I will be posting a lot of things in the next few days I'm sure.
@KiwiEV Yes there will be. We have a camera team recording everything they can. There will be copious coverage.
Very grateful for very long sleep. This #FullyChargedLIVE business can be quite tiring but so much fun, such amazing people with us yesterday, so patient, polite and with incredible enthusiasm.  Looking forward to today.

The Dort is going to live tweet the final session for today with @Carpervert and @helenczerski in about 4 minutes.
Important!  We are experiencing a large amount of cars arriving at Silverstone, we are opening another car park. Please bare with us. Please be patient. We’re here all day.
It’s started.  https://t.co/mGfM0LCDfL

@Andyhague68 Online soon. They are VERY warm.
@andrewhockings No, let's be honest, it does sound bloody daft especially when I say it.
@nn_cyclist Sadly not this year.
@meltymcface Perfect :-)
@jezmck Yes, that's fine
Ticket's to #FullyChargedLIVE  If you can print them, you'll be very popular with the poor stressed ticket folks.
@Bethanicus Printing is good. The ticket folks really really want you to print it. You did good.
@airmonkey1 Yes, soon.
@Kyyanno Yes.
@cwoodsdj Silverstone, for the #FullyChargedLive event https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@RossDScott You did the right thing. They would love you to print your ticket. I think I kind of misspoke :-)
@Ianmarsters @silverstone @BritishGT If you're happy to buy a ticket :-)
@NLODC There will be very soon
@The_Real_Gonzo no, they don't need a ticket

Can anyone coming to Fully Charged Live give this visitor a lift from either Banbury train station or maybe Oxford? https://t.co/KzIFf1LWQY
@sgentils That was a dream plan that didn't quite come off. Next year for sure. Sorry. I'll try something else.
@rogerdaily @FullyChargedShw @zap_map @DriveElectricUK @EVEC_MK @helenczerski @MyEnergiLTD @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert @ManMadeMoon Blimey, yes, I think so. Certainly not more.
I have been told you can get tickets for this weekends #FullyChargedLive at the little ticket booth in the car park. (Sunday is less manic, just a tip) https://t.co/BHlpw6NiqE

It’s total pandemonium at #FullyChargedLIVE but we will be ready! https://t.co/xYVz8yjmMn
#FullyChargedLive It's the opposite of Kev Costner's Field of Dreams. In our case it's "they're coming! Quick, we'd better build it." Today.... we build it. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@eRacingNews @EVEC_MK @SilverstoneUK Which is why we have sent countless warnings, maps and tweets. There is no charging at Silverstone. There is a good spread of charging in the immediate area.
@Charles545587 @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @zap_map @DriveElectricUK @EVEC_MK @helenczerski @MyEnergiLTD @Carpervert @ManMadeMoon Under 16s free, don't need a ticket for them.
@eRacingNews @SilverstoneUK Very very few, and certainly not enough for possibly thousands of EV's this weekend.
@Grrfolk I agree. Industrial meat production is just insanity, I'm not quite vegetarian, close, I'm definitely not vegan but I think we should all cut meat consumption by 80% +
@Stewy13 Admire your confidence.
@Grrfolk I love the fact that within 5 sends of me posting that you've got a robust denial of everything the film shows. Simple fact is, American meat industry, no matter what you think about diets, is deeply CORRUPT and unsustainable.
Could not have done it without the amazing support of everyone exhibiting and the dogged determination and commitment of @FullyChargedDan but yes, very exciting. https://t.co/Uml6eFSquT
Damn and blast. The dort forced me to watch 'What the Health' a documentary on meat and plant based diets, on Netflix. No more bacon for this bad boy. https://t.co/mXCOCvHqIV
@greatbigbadger It says very clearly in the description below the video.  "Costing from £63,495, this car is eligible for the OLEV electric vehicle grant scheme in the UK"
@Sites_Chris @cleantechnica @Model3Owners Basically very soon. There's some seriously cool V2G stuff on display at #FullyChargedLive this weekend and we're shooting some episodes about the technology and what it could mean.
Latest #FullyCharged is all about the 100% electric Jaguar I-PACE. And yes, you can turn off the artificial noise and it's very quiet. https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
@umrath Thye Jaguar can recite OTA updates, just saying. Check this for more detail. https://t.co/zthBVMvCZQ
@DanielSneeUK I don't read either so I wouldn't know. :-)
@JAMF60313356 @Hull_Leaf_Guy @ecocars1 No, you can turn it on or off. It's possible the over the air updates will enable a wider range of sounds. I don't know. I expect Jaguar might consider it.
I've been very good today. I haven't mentioned the editor of a certain newspaper who's stepping down after a long stint 'influencing the politics of a nation.' No question, he's certainly done that. But 4 million readers from a population of 60 million. Very niche.
Here's the I-PACE episode I mentioned on Periscope. https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
@MikeTonge That's very kind of you but I think we're okay. Fleets of Tesla's going too.

@craigneale That was @paulcoxon who I have followed on Twitter for years but had never met before.
You did Steve and it was really good. Such a shame we didn't carry on making it but, I suppose we've both survived. The fact that they refer to the bus from Speed hints that someone may just have seen the original and best 'Hollywood Science.' https://t.co/1TkcEMw79I
@Popfictional @davelucas We have begged, we have pleaded. We don't know if it'll be there.
@WORMSStweet @FullyChargedShw How wonderful, congratulations! Gorgeous baby!!
@umrath They were covered in a previous episode, I should have just repeated it all. My fail. https://t.co/zthBVMvCZQ
@rhodri Huh, so offended you posted a picture of honeysuckle! Totally fascist. I’m fuming. Livid. Incandescent!!
And not just once. Shout it again and again. 'You can turn it off.' Other than that, it's all good. By the way, the artificial sound, you can turn to off, in fact it's quite hard to turn on. Just so you know. https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
You know that moment when you refer to an artificial sound inside an electric car that has amazing noise cancellation and you don't shout at camera "You can turn it off!!!" That's me that is. https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
@GrierAutoEpic Don't worry, I don't say it, I don't think it and it's the most boring cliché in EV history.
Shot in Portugal, where I wibbly wobbling around in a Jaguar I-Pace, off road and on track | Fully Charged https://t.co/U4WSgmEIov
@GuanoLad That is a very good description, it's been non stop manic panic for the last 3 months, but the organisation is very much down to @FullyChargedDan who is a renewables hero
Plus, the #FullyCharged first long drive in the I-PACE is the next episode coming later today.
Just announced. Jaguar I-PACE will be making one of its first UK public appearances at Fully Charged Live. Nice. https://t.co/xZaqCgaaJW
@GridPasses @au_tom_otive @ericfeunteun @pluginadventure Such a confused jumble of opinions and poll results it's impossible to make head or tail of it. Possibly deliberate obfuscation and calculated confusion to slow down the transition.  Actually it's very clever, bollocks but clever bollocks
2nd attempt. How do I get into Fully Charged Live? https://t.co/BHlpw6NiqE

@Whambarqueen @FullyChargedShw @ChargemasterPlc @GoUltraLow @REAssociation correction. OR big battery.
@Whambarqueen @FullyChargedShw @ChargemasterPlc @GoUltraLow @REAssociation Definitely not aimed at EV fans alone. It's a great place to learn about all manner of stuff. We really wanted to make sure if you've never been near an electric car, solar panel of big battery, it will still make sense. And there's nice food and lovely people.
@MikeTonge The one all the signs point to, apparently it's going to be very clear. And I'm very pleased to hear you're coming. More info here: https://t.co/nu2uiRpqYi
@_iPanda_ @FullyChargedShw @jimalkhalili @ManMadeMoon @foe_us @wwf_uk @ClientEarth @GreenpeaceUK @CarolineLucas @algore @LeoDiCaprio @elonmusk Maybe you should ask @CeresPower
@JerseyEV @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert We've sold a LOT, but the halls are very BIG so it should be okay :-) Will reveal final figures next week. Basics, we don't know for sure yet.
@seventyr @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @BritishGT @SilverstoneUK We know, it's all part of the fun. I thoroughly approve of powerful ICE cars blatting around motor racing circuits.  Just hope for far fewer on our roads.
@Clive__Horn The 330e is a great car, if you can charge it regularly it'll give stonking low mpg.
@lunalibera7 @PRJournoRequest @JournoLinkMedia Sounds like you've had a lot of offers, @BethLilyRace and @ELPinchbeck are both excellent but if you need an old bloke, happy to discuss
If you're coming or thinking of coming to #FullyChargedLIVE please click this poll. The information is quite useful for us. https://t.co/AGZqeK5RBq
There you go, from the man who knows https://t.co/iG7IvVpPKr
@Bruceha23791470 @FullyChargedShw @NissanEV_UK @joinpureplanet @globalevrt Oh damn, yes, the date is right, the day is wrong. Forgive the confusion. V2G is on Sunday. Will try to sort it. It is year one.... he says making a feeble excuse
If you need to know how to get into #FullyChargedLIVE go here and scroll down. It's all explained. https://t.co/nu2uiRpqYi
@Bruceha23791470 @FullyChargedShw @NissanEV_UK @joinpureplanet @globalevrt Well spotted. It's on Saturday 9th. Duuur. Heads will roll!
Woot! https://t.co/QI8M1pYYq4
@emelano @simonhackett Yes, those poor multi national global energy corporations, barely two cents to rub together. Un-Be-lievable
@kmoorman1968 @simonhackett No sir, you are a standard flawed humanoid. No shame attached.
Have a look/listen to this crystal clear short talk by @simonhackett about energy storage, flow batteries and the future of the grid. He knows his onions, and his batteries https://t.co/CJCsYb3eXU
@sbarker108 @EVEC_MK @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @DriveElectricUK @colinmckerrache @AutoVoltMag @ecocars1 @EVNewsDaily @SilverstoneUK You may be right but the Leaf and Zoe have both sold in the 100's of thousands and the sales are going up at an incredible rate, so someone likes them. I've been driving my Leaf for 7 years and it's great.
@sbarker108 @EVEC_MK @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @DriveElectricUK @colinmckerrache @AutoVoltMag @ecocars1 @EVNewsDaily @SilverstoneUK I know your goading comments are a bit troll like but they make me laugh. Have you ever got out of a car at a 'dinner party' thinking, 'when people see me get out they will think I'm cool.' Hint. No they don't.
@BinaryTweedDeej They don’t need tickets. Under 16’s free. Depends on their age, there is some seriously cool RC racing
@sbarker108 @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @DriveElectricUK @EVEC_MK @colinmckerrache @AutoVoltMag @ecocars1 @EVNewsDaily @SilverstoneUK I’m confused. They are all electric cars with ranges above 100 miles now, most over 150. What year are you in? 2012?
Wow. That’s like proper PR!   https://t.co/ZYEJufk7P7
@rider45 I'm not 100% sure, so I'd print it if you can, but the ticket folks are very sophisticated, I'm sure a phone will be okay.
There's now a video explaining how you'll be able to get into #FullyChargedLIVE this weekend. Scroll down the page a bit, yes, lower, yes, that's it! https://t.co/zscvV4FN67
Any offers? Dutch guys are always lovely. https://t.co/GeKLLszUsf
@APOLL09 I hugely agree with you, largely agree, bigly.
@dannyboy262 Yes, covers both days and there are slight variations of talks on day one and two. But one day should be enough for most sane folk. :-)
@sydney_ev We have 5 strong camera crew shooting everything. Might require a bit of editing afterwards but we will be reporting from #FullyChargedLive  ASAP afterwards
@HorizonCSafaris I think the official line is 'it will be around 5,000.'
@evmanuk Yes.
@Ben_Houghton It's comically inaccurate and here's one very important point. If you only measure what comes out of a tailpipe, is that a realistic assessment of an ICE cars emissions? No, it isn't unless fossil fuels arrive magically at the pump with zero previous impact.
That's Dan and me after every #RedDwarf recording. LOLz https://t.co/WLzIMzG0vR
OMG, #FullyChargedLIVE is going to be huger than huge. Its going to be bigly big, and there's so much to see and do! https://t.co/nu2uiRpqYi
@au_tom_otive @raymasseytweets Wow! Ray said that. Impressive.
@vimes1984 Thank you, I will p[ass your message on to the relevant authorities... @InkSharkman
@RogueBaboon57 @anorak45 I just want to point out that I didn't say there's no future for TG. I think it will run and run as it does, just as you say, play to its core audience and yes, they want to see expensive aspirational cars slide sideways on disused runways. :-)
This is a good point, Tom knows his chargers. https://t.co/Rl6OCENsNc
@pmansf77 @evmanuk @ecotricity @ElecHighway @POLARnetwork @au_tom_otive @She_sElectric @ecarstrading @KateFantom @ruralleafowner @EVEC_MK @RenaultZoeClub @evopinion @OLEVgovuk From what I'm hearing, touch to pay will become more widespread in next couple of years. It's the obvious solution, or a single, nationwide tag/card. Anything to make it EASY!!
@GreenJimll @Telegraph Move along there, nothing to see. Internal combustion engine catching fire? Never happens, move along :-)
@Ross_RBT @Adam_Calland @IanCallum @McCons @JimChapman @theragers Wait until you see the new I-PACE episode of #FullyCharged I shot. Madness, off road in an electric car? No probs. Insane capabilities.
Just saw Cyril, our sadly missed dog Joey’s offspring. He’s a big fella now and yes, I’ve washed my ears. https://t.co/zw35OKjAPz
I posted a tweet with the wrong link, like a total bozo. This is the post I wrote about Top Gear and Fully Charged. https://t.co/jCSMpzzpMO
@Markalus @Jaybuz_ Blimey, wrong link. What a bozo. https://t.co/jCSMpzzpMO
@evmanuk Only a deafening silence :-)
@Marko_tweet I apologise, I'll write something massively offensive and unconsidered soon I promise :-)
Short read: Wrote a little blog post about Fully Charged and Top Gear.  https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@StephenDeverell @FullyChargedDan @ImpossibleFoods Whenever I see a tweet like that I ignore it because it's so boring.
@MikeTonge @StephenDeverell @FullyChargedDan @ImpossibleFoods Sorry Mike.
@MikeTonge @StephenDeverell @FullyChargedDan @ImpossibleFoods Thank you Michael, have heard of him but haven't seen this. Will keep a bookmark for future reference.
@Iscarider Thank you for your support.
@sl1kr1ky @maddiemoate @cbbc Agree and @maddiemoate will soon be appearing on #FullyCharged  Boom! I know!  (plus we have a couple of irons in the broadcast TV fire)
@StephenDeverell @FullyChargedDan @ImpossibleFoods Whenever I see a tweet such as this I always want to point to 'People Quake' a very well researched book by Fred Pearce which suggests an alternative to the tired old 'population explosion' myth. https://t.co/RmQcSTKin1

Just posted a blog about Fully Charged and Top Gear. https://t.co/jCSMpzzpMO
It was really enjoyable and informative, and in future, I will read the emails before I show up. Gulp... got away with it. https://t.co/oXJvirfLTm
Very good question. @FullyChargedDan any idea? https://t.co/K5NB5uCqoy
@AtTheVan @mwt2008 @SilverstoneUK @ElecHighway @OLEVgovuk @NGControlRoom @FullyChargedShw Brilliant headlines. Quick, apply for a job at Britain's leading newspaper!
I'll be watching this. https://t.co/jhOGz6Pm5y
@David_Flett I'm not in the least, partly because I have worked in traditional telly for a long time so I know what it's like, and partly because there is an unquestionable bias at the BBC against renewables and electric cars. Deep and ingrained, don't know why.
@realVanTriest @Maltes1 Yes, I'm quietly obsessed with @SonoMotors and are trying to arrange a visit later this year
@Spectre223 @DannyJohnJules @RJ_Biker I thought it sounded like an electric bike. Double sweet
@mwt2008 @SilverstoneUK @ElecHighway @OLEVgovuk @NGControlRoom @FullyChargedShw Yeah, alright, don't rub it in! Blimey, I'm a nervous wreck already!
"Bobby and Dale chew the electric Tofu." Possibly not the clearest title of a #FullyCharged episode, but hopefully interesting none the less. https://t.co/0ZlW3h9Z4D

At Silverstone checking out parking, logistics and making a short video to explain how to get in and find your way to #FullyChargedLIVE https://t.co/yNmwCf1IAR
@Maltes1 Yes, not only heard about them but busy arranging test drives in the UK. Boat loads of them arriving soon.
@gilescoren @Carpervert @BBC_TopGear You should do it Giles. BTW, are you coming to Fully Charged Live to brush up your electric car knowledge. Just a suggestion :-) https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
I’ve just been on Radio London talking electric cars, difficult to concentrate as there was a massive storm pelting down in Gloucestershire. #thunderpants.
@Carpervert @BBC_TopGear Mine's on airplane mode. :-)
@Ghillie_Dubh I think the idea is this is 'last mile' transportation, for inner city deliveries, not motorway transport. :-)
@Ghillie_Dubh Yes, electric pedal assist, very easy to pull heavy loads
Wouldn’t it be great if they refused to grant him residency. I’m emailing all my French mates.  On the other hand, we really don’t need him here. Bon voyage Nige https://t.co/cGykrjbnif
@wdron @LemBingley Do it!  LOLz
@SimoneGiertz Only just caught up on this story. Very shocked but so happy to hear Simone is in recovery. She clearly has so many fans and admirers, I’m one of them  and I know we all wish her a super speedy recovery.

@seanmmitchell @Fairaday @ManMadeMoon Hi Sean. Can you follow me or @FullyChargedShw so we can DM. Many thanks.
@damienjmiller @FullyChargedShw There is Parking on site, just not right next to the venue. There will be electric taxis, Tesla’s etc running shuttles back and forth. Silverstone is quite big.
@BrianDunning Uuuuum. Don’t know. :-) I’m not going, @Carpervert is.
Any Tesla Model 3 owning #FullyCharged viewers in Colorado? We're filming there later this year and would love to have a go.
Before, during and after. :-)
@reissdjo @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @ManMadeMoon @DriveElectricUK @wisebuddah @ElectricNation_ @helenczerski @Tesla Please read through the tips about charging on the Fully Charged site: No charging on site. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@BlackTopMediaUK @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @ManMadeMoon @DriveElectricUK @wisebuddah @ElectricNation_ @helenczerski @Tesla Yes, loads, and loads more information about what's on here: https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
LOLz. https://t.co/eGm0iktLLh
@Carpervert @YouTube That's an excellent report, you standing in the sun with some scrap metal behind you. Love it.
@alconor @daviesdjandy80 @OLEVgovuk @FullyChargedShw I have heard so many equally appalling anecdotal reports of truly pathetic responses from dealerships. I know some are exemplary, I've even given talks to car dealers at conferences but it's a huge stumbling block
@daviesdjandy80 @OLEVgovuk @FullyChargedShw I'm already there... well, not literally there but I'm going.
@embaachu @afneil @nfergus @JamesCleverly @LibDems LOL, that's one way of putting it :-)
Excellent! Thank you. A commercial for Dutch #FullyCharged viewers https://t.co/BApOtMAgWY
@norbs I was in Sydney when that happened. I loved it. 'What's wrong with ya? Got coal-phobia have ya!' Brilliant knuckle dragging.
@JimHearson Mate! Brilliant idea... oh wait, I already did
What a brilliant ad campaign. Spot on, funny, punchy. Jeez, I love Aussies! https://t.co/gbKty7vD53
@BobAndersson @CoopEnergy @waitrose Don't start me with @waitrose in Cheltenham. Perfect location for 25-50 chargers underground. Other supermarkets do it. I have asked many times.
@christineburns @CoopEnergy I wondered why I was sloshing around so much
@cylonitis @CoopEnergy @StopFundingHate There's always a down side.
@Ozwon @CoopEnergy the marjoram bit was a 'joke' and yes, we already grow it in the garden. :-)
Here's why I like shopping at the Co-op in Bourton on the water. Thanks to @CoopEnergy I charge my car with solar while I potter around the isles forgetting to get the marjoram. https://t.co/wZXJXz8d9n
Just noticed my last tweet said a ‘who train’ when I meant ‘whole train.’  Obviously a who train is driven by Pete Townsend.
I think there might be a bit of a storm over london. Just watched a who train platform full of passengers jump in unison as massive clap of thunder let rip right above us #impressive
Been talking about Smart meters. I’ve had one installed 10 days ago. Well do a report about them soon. A smart meter can help track your energy, harness green energy &amp; access the best deals: https://t.co/GVqi5g8kJh #EVs #AD

@JoeArisia @MrRoryReid @pluginadventure @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Spot on.
@MrRoryReid @pluginadventure @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Of course you can. Help balance the carbon.
@mcsmik We are still finalising the arrangements. We're shooting a video explaining how it will work later this week. It should all go really smoothly... gulp....
@Russell05958081 I think we even have XXX large. I like a roomy T for my tummy :-)
We would indeed. https://t.co/fSpkZZ8gie
@mcsmik Turnout is so big we have had to move to external car parks. There will be electric taxis, Teslas and busses to transport people to the venue. Details being updated on here: https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@jepostie There will be some stuff to buy, loads of stuff to order and tons of stuff to see.
@Sklblue @FullyChargedDan Under 16's free. All explained on the page  https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@Russell05958081 Yes, there will be many Fully Charged T shirts on sale at bargain prices!
Fantastic that you are joining us sir! https://t.co/qybEyGbHsL
@DaveMotion think one day will be enough for mere mortals, but you'd be welcome to come both days
All the details about Fully Charged Live are here. More updates coming soon but it's going to be great. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@lowie @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw Blimey, what a question. My only answer can be probably not yet unless you travel by bicycle. Through the tunnel, not a ferry.
@sunrayswench @106Euan @MyEnergiLTD @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw @mygreenpod @She_sElectric @Carpervert @ecocars1 @KateFantom While I wholeheartedly agree, even if an electric car is charged purely from a coal burning power plant, it's still 'cleaner' in every respect than a fossil burning internal combustion engine
@phil_park It does depend on their age, any kids over 10 I think will love it anyway, loads of things to see. We are hoping to get some small RC cars and bigger drive them yourself models, awaiting final confirmation on that.
News update on #FullyCharged with @Carpervert and @bobbyllew  Honda Urban EV, electric Catamaran and a-ha. https://t.co/aRH7KK5JAw
@aeddan19 Yes, we really hope so, that's the plan. We'll start planning #FullyChargedLive 2019 immediately after this years event
@ITAdventurer @KateFantom @ruralleafowner @The_PlugSeeker @snoopakabigbird @jtchivers @Carpervert @ecocars1 @evmanuk @She_sElectric @EVNewsDaily @evopinion @Pod_Point @FullyChargedShw @ElectrekCo You have to breath into the pain. Seriously, it's a lot better than 8 years ago when #FullyCharged started, then it was 'throw you battery into landfill,' 'melt the grid, 'EV's are slow and ugly' So the media is catching up, they're only 5-7 years out of date now.
If you are interested in renewables, the energy transition, electric cars, nice food, lovely people, great talks, you could always drop in at #FullyChargedLIVE in 2 weeks time. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@realjonconnor @Baddiel Then...please....ignore....us....darling
@Baddiel Just caught up with you DiD, really lovely, very enjoyable listen, thank you for being you.
@EGCtechnical It's just not something I've ever considered. 'Do I have enough to get home?' is a regular question. How much I have when I get there is, so far, irrelevant. I plug in and charge, but then I have 2 electric cars so can use other one in emergency I suppose.
@EGCtechnical As others have responded, I'm not sure what the minimum range would be. If the car is still moving, I'd be very happy to arrive home with near 0%. In my experience that's V rare, done it maybe 3 times in 8 years
@m4rko @Tesla @FullyChargedShw I think it's quite new, I used it the other day.
@neilrgolding @FullyChargedDan Absolutely right. We want to record the event for those that can’t make it and to publicise #FullyChargedLIVE 2019!
@neilrgolding @FullyChargedDan We have been discussing this and are trying to cover every talk. We will definitely release a couple of shows about the event and feature the talks big time.
@nicksundae One is @ubitricity who have installed 100's of chargers in London and Oxford. Others are available
Have a look at what's happening at #FullyChargedLIVE on June 9th &amp; 10th at Silverstone. It's grown into a truly impressive event, very much down to the hard work of @FullyChargedDan  So much to see and do, and loads of lovely people too.  https://t.co/nu2uiRpqYi

Been driving the Jaguar I-PACE all morning. Report coming on #FullyCharged soon. It is, I can say without hesitation, breathtaking. It’s a big leap forward in electric vehicles. About to drive on on a racetrack. Driving like a vicar.
@Sklblue From now on I can charge it at night on off peak (cheaper) Power at night. So yes, solar much lower in winter but overall saving are substantial
@kalkanite62 Yes, and a Tesla Powerwall
Energy use at my place for the last 7 days. I have also added a total of 380 miles range in 2 electric cars during that time. Energy cost from grid over the week - 29 pence. https://t.co/yBc66FXoqz

@boriswrecker67 It's all down to physics and the laws of diminishing returns, or so I'm told by potentially very clever folks. The more wind resistance, caused by turbines, the more force is needed to move the vehicle. You'd use more energy than you'd generate

@evmanuk I think technically you can but we're not encouraging it as we need to know numbers beforehand, it's going to be busy!
Even if the weather isn't like this for #FullyChargedLIVE it'll still be amazing, huge halls full of amazing stuff. More huge halls underneath full of even more amazing stuff. Still a few tickets left. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp

@Shamrockvegan @Gocycle @EkaterinaToole @BromptonBicycle It does fold up, we're making a #FullyCharged episode about it
Just reached 51kph (31.6mph) on a @Gocycle  OK, I was going down hill, okay it's not that fast, but the bike is built for the city, I was pelting down a country lane. #whimpering #pedalassist #electricbike https://t.co/23gAFFVaZg

@OH_oscarhamish You noticed! They are very comfortable and we will mention them on a show, I totes promise! See you at #FullyChargedLIVE
@SimplyPaul That's sweet, of course he's absolutely right about me, less so about who funds Fully Charged and of course absolutely wrong about wind turbines as described in that tatty flyer.
@nuclearforus @SimplyPaul yawn
@SimplyPaul Clue of Ridley connection is in claim at bottom. '0% of world energy to the nearest whole number.'  Ridley hates 'silly windmills' as he called them, he goes red and clenches his fists when he mentions them. Of course wind turbines have reduced coal use to near zero in UK. Hmmm.
@NovalutionGSi @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert @BlackTopMediaUK @TamiyaUK @FullyChargedShw @Earcc_Norwich Oh yes please. Can they come @FullyChargedDan, can they, can they! Please Dan. Can they!!
@SimplyPaul It's part of a fairly tragic lobby who spread this garbage which is based on lies, casual assumptions, ignorance and twisted figures perpetrated in the main by Lord Ridley, a coal mine owner and Lord Lawson, climate change denying ultra right loons both.
I don't want to discourage anyone from getting out into the lovely weather, but just in case you don't know about #fullychargedlive here's a brief update. June 9-10 at Silverstone. https://t.co/ulYcsYMuwh
@nextecocar @BethLilyRace @ecarstrading @Carpervert @She_sElectric I've heard nothing. Will discreetly ask around.
Hard not to agree with this. https://t.co/SRC2CZqh8g
Just been clearing an overgrown patch of garden, (there's plenty more for wildlife) and realised this gardening activity can quite hard work.
Ooooh, nice colour. https://t.co/2JHAMVsihr
Bit of an update about #FullyChargedLive https://t.co/P0NEKkGAhY
This is such a simple and brilliant idea. https://t.co/EOR9V5cZn8
@stevengw There would be no need, you are already gorgeous!
A most excellent vehicular combination sir. https://t.co/FzZXbPiKsK
@TheNerdJay I do charge mine with the sun at this time of year, I was trying to give the average cost if charged from grid
@MacIomhair Oh blimey, good question.  In a Nissan Leaf, roughly 2.5p per mile at current elec cost, so 2,800 miles.  In a Tesla Model S, 4p per mile, so a mere 1,750. However from April to Sept I charge from solar at home, so basically very hard to calculate, around 1p per mile.
@fezzy84 I reply to 100's of Tweets a week. I even like occasionally, but it was a very funny scene to rehearse and Rik and Aide were both great fun to work with.
Very much my experience too. https://t.co/bI6llWsEsM
I think @teslanomicsco will be happy to watch this. https://t.co/EWF6bD3CWJ
@mariamcerlane @MumpsBrian @Carpervert 10 points to Ms McErlane.
@MumpsBrian @Carpervert Thank you. Perfect.
@MumpsBrian @Carpervert Can you let us know where that is?
Ooh, #BMW i3S. S for sport. Snazzy. Sexy. Smooth. Swift. https://t.co/OtyBZYdRCC
Sadly made the mistake of merely looking at today's front cover of the English (deliberate description) newspaper, the Daily Mail. A headline is calling people who are questioning the current regime as 'traitors.'  Really, traitors? Is Elizabeth I still queen? Where's my cloak?
The Mercedes EQC electric SUV. Super exclusive preview with @Carpervert of an electric car coming in 2019. Big, fast, smooth and very very quiet. https://t.co/0hkXizuQOQ
Lovely talk. https://t.co/71W9pzrgOE
@Darren_Fewins @ManMadeMoon That's the badger
@The_PlugSeeker @FullyChargedShw @SilverstoneUK @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert @DriveElectricUK @ecotricity @achrisevans @ChargemasterPlc @GaryLineker The biggest wind turbines are being made right now, they will be installed at sea, 10 megawatts, 110 meter blades. The ones you see on land are usually 2 or 3 megawatts. Biggest solar parks are in China. Don’t know how big but huge!
@Denty420 Congrats!
And here’s 2 old Nissan Leaf batteries reconfigured into a 48kWh static battery. #want https://t.co/jtmVtXADkJ
Had a great afternoon at launch of @FaradayInst at Harwell in Oxfordshire. Here’s a Williams carbon fibre electric drive train. https://t.co/bnc4jLuvJa
@ManMadeMoon @MikeTonge @Carpervert You’d love the I-PACE sir.
Great overview of the transformation ahead, with research made possible by the Faraday Institution. Observant viewers of #FullyCharged will spot Peter Bruce, battery guru. https://t.co/IvAuGXIdKT
Just witnessed the unveiling of a plaque to John Goodenough, the inventor of the lithium-ion battery. (In 1972!). #faradayinstitution https://t.co/miHrxvF3sx
@InnovateJon @pittso @info_specific Would love to see what you’re up to. Can you email contact@fullychargedshow.co.uk Thanks
Very exciting to be at the ‘Energy Tech’ event at Harwell. I’m on a bus full of boffins!  Hopefully seeing amazing tech, and yes, we plan to do a #FullyCharged episode about what’s going on here.
Amazing job, and also on display at #FullyChargedLive  (just saying) https://t.co/adVy95eQrA
@AlejandraMagna7 @Denty420 I believe a certain smeeee heeee called @Denty420 is going for his first job interview. Here's wishing you great success in your career sir.
@IronMillHydro @AdamJM87 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw I love the idea of #FullyChargedDownUnderLive The Mrs would also approve. Hopefully one day. Maybe next year?
The Mercedes EQC is a 100% electric SUV coming in 2019. @Carpervert got a very exclusive ride in one.  Sehr gehobene Klasse https://t.co/0hkXizuQOQ
@blackeyeddog @AtTheVan @LincolnshireMan @au_tom_otive I drove from Oslo to London, ok, in a Tesla, it was easy. 5 years ago, very hard, now, yes it'll take a bit longer but it'll be an adventure. https://t.co/i617ftri8Z
@tristramc I agree, but this is partly because Tesla have hammered the sales of Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Jaguar etc, and they are now finally responding. There are numerous smaller, cheaper and sensible electric cars available
@RobManser Availability of charging points is crucial. Great example is Westgate shopping Mall in Oxford, newly built, with 50 charge points in the car park. Not 15, 50. Every new car park should have at least that many,
While I'm passing, this episode @Carpervert did about the Rimac C2 is fascinating. The Rimac C2? Oh, it's just a 250 mph electric supercar, nothing to see here, move along now. https://t.co/NWNWOqwmHb
My face tweet of the day (okay, so far, its only 7:45am) but yes, we're already planning ahead, so it won't... fingers crossed https://t.co/gTptjkfM9d
@robrobdean @abckimberley @abcperth @ProfRayWills @GeoffHutchison @Tesla Mate! Thats impressive. I'm very jealous, it's very high on my to do list, one day.
Actual breaking news on #FullyCharged  Surely not. Yes! The Mercedes Benz EQC. We were under embargo! Now we're not. The 100% electric SUV Merc coming in 2019 https://t.co/0hkXizuQOQ
@johnvoelcker @GreenCarReports You’ve done an amazing job. Your work is much appreciated and good luck in your new ventures.
@dannycrm @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan There are numerous driving instructors using EVs and yes, it’s only an auto license but where were going we don’t need gears.
Just got back from an amazing trip to Austria to see a huge community renewables project in Bruck (outside Vienna) and Florence (Italy) with the Mrs to see art and churches. And Tuscan food. Love a bit of Tuscan. Warm here isn’t it.
Nikki will also be at #FullyChargedLive. https://t.co/Bjwbpx3X9w
@DannyJohnJules But yes, I do. Zzzzzzzt. Zzzzzzzt
Sir!  Really!  Most unnecessary. https://t.co/bdPjlbQse8
@ProfRayWills @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan @plugshare @HorizonPower_WA @westernpowerwa @TomRaftery @seth_leitman @simonahac @elonmusk @BjornKHaugland Sorry Ray, got a bit carried away with my stereotypical bad Aussie accent on that one. I was channeling the Queensland rellies. :-)
@johnantifas @2di2d @FullyChargedDan There is no single energy generation solution. Never has been. Never will be.
This is the single most important point about charging electric cars 🚙 https://t.co/Cbr3DnC1Et
@ManMadeMoon Sweet Jesus that looked heavy.
@michaelbisson @RichardHammond @tomwookieford @Carpervert @sniffpetrol @JeremyClarkson @MrJamesMay @jonbentley90 Not me.
@zimpaz @Carpervert There are no official lines from Fully Charged other than the background overview that in the long run, human beings should work toward burning less stuff.
@johnantifas @2di2d @FullyChargedDan V2G technology just emerging. It’s not about ‘draining the car flat to support the grid.’ It’s feeding a small amount in every now and then, if you set it to be 100% in the morning, that’s what it’ll be.
Spot on. https://t.co/A7WgZSMQf0
I’m sure many of you will have seen this. A first as far as I know. https://t.co/44BHbB8ZcE
Now that IS funny https://t.co/k35fU3o5nb
@mrrobertbrendan Hello sir!  Here’s hoping your spirits raise to tolerable levels and you experience moderate amounts of humanoid happiness.
This https://t.co/6rQCVvxV0w
@Darren_Fewins Hybrids burn oil, maybe less but they still do it. Great transitionary tech, but surely we can move on. By 20 bloody 40. 👴
@Darren_Fewins @BBCBreaking Sounds perfectly reasonable to me😬
Nice menu. I’ll have a Kryten, medium to well. https://t.co/bDqLPF9gc3
@evcarmike No, it’s in case engineers drop a bolt from 100 meters above.
I’m not going to lie, circumstances and late onset vertigo ruled me out of going up the wind turbine but a plucky camera crew did. That’s the view up the inside of a wind turbine tower. https://t.co/4Mr4jSDEy1
@Carpervert @YouTube Big congrats Jonny.
These are very big fellows when you get close. Entercon E150. One of 12 machines around Seibersdorf which produce 64 million kWh a year. https://t.co/GjyF4JUe8s
@zebedee666 I wish. I’ll certainly suggest it.
Having an amazing time filming community owned wind farms around Bruck, Austria with @EIB https://t.co/pxZOzZr2UA
@maxjhodgson Well that’s true enough.
Another clue https://t.co/JJtTVS3pkC
Can you guess what’s behind me https://t.co/wkMDGDQHd4
You are too kind sir. Never been compared to Jiminy Cricket before. 😊 https://t.co/OAdHiq64Ka
So would we. We'll definitely try. Diggers!! https://t.co/wDgm1FM7eP
Fully Charged Live. It's a show, with loads of electric cars, bikes, amazing clean tech for home, work and travel and brilliant short talks by people who know actual stuff!! And me and @Carpervert  June 9 &amp; 10, Silverstone. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
I've never seen him before, he looks like a well dodgy geezer to me. https://t.co/Zgdm6vMWOd
Congrats Rebecca, very jealous. I sometimes wonder how many of these tweets @NissanEV_UK see. :-) #justsayin https://t.co/ZA9LCzqJiw
@bertchalmers @Carpervert @aminorjourney @DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco @Tesla Wow, where did you see it?
@MikeTonge You are too kind and it's a real shame if you can't make it. A year one live show as always going to be a steep learning curve. Okay, it's a vertical learning wall but we're getting there. We'll do more, and hopefully in different locations
@GarethDeanPR @FullyChargedShw OMG, don't say that. Was it really 6 years ago! Lovely whiskey though.
Little bit of an update about Fully Charged Live. Coming to Silverstone on June 9th and 10th. One ticket covers both days. It's a bargain! And so much to see and hear. https://t.co/6QN41mbkeW
@Neilh111 @FullyChargedDan @FullyChargedShw Yes. Very simple answer :-)
@stupot42 @MyEnergiLTD Yes it does know about battery and yes, only kicks in on eco++ when battery is 100% which is when I took the pic.
@yorkshirekenny @alconor Okay, boring now. You are presumably unaware of the monsterous handouts given to gas and nuclear generators making up around 90% of all UK subsidies. But please carry on banging on about smug gits like me, knock yourself out.
@yorkshirekenny @alconor I don't get the feed in tariff and it's ending soon and no one is paying to subsidise my solar. Get off your high angry horse. Yes, I could afford it, does that mean I should just burn coal. Absurd reductionist argument
I'm a simple man. This makes me happy. My @MyEnergiLTD #zappi charger. (On display at Fully Charged Live) Top left, solar generation. Bottom right, going into my car. Zero from the grid, added 37 miles range today. https://t.co/CVkZBvw2Qy
@yorkshirekenny @alconor Some of us remember that this promise came from the Nuclear Power industry. 'Too cheap to meter' was the phrase. DIdn't quite pan out. I've used a fair amount of electricity today and it hasn't cost me 1p. Solar and battery and electric car.
@RichardGledhill We will be doing this, just waiting for everyone to confirm. All the ones mentioned din the video are definite, there's about another 50 that we're still sorting out.
@CharlesGloor @FullyChargedShw @DriveElectricUK @FullyChargedDan @Carpervert @ChargemasterPlc @ecotricity @elonmusk @DavidHsearch @ManMadeMoon @achrisevans I feel your pain. Come along to #FullyChargedLIVE and meet the people who run the system :-)  But be nice to them 'cos they're trying really hard to make it all work.
More and more people, cars/products and services are coming to Fully Charged Live on June 9th &amp; 10th at Silverstone. I think it's going to be moderately epic. https://t.co/6QN41mbkeW
@johnoft Good call. I know some folks in the council. I'll make enquiries. Thanks
@yorkshirekenny Okay, you may be able to imagine I have these conversations regularly. Nothing is set in stone, things are developing rapidly. The essential underlying fact is the current tech, combustion engines, are inefficient and filthy dirty. So change is coming anyway.
@MitchBenn Wow Mitch, how did you get caught up with these folks. I've had some weird tweets in my time but they pale into sanity in comparison to these ones :-)
@yorkshirekenny I think the reasons 'they' didn't develop them years ago are many and complex, but high capacity reliable rechargeable battery tech (which came out of computer industry) is relatively new. I drive an EV and live in a rural area.
@yorkshirekenny I'm not sure there's any mention of EV's going fast in my previous tweet. I mean they can, but who cares, that's not what Fully Charged Live is about for sure.
@GallagherGuille @FullyChargedShw I think I might be there, not 100% sure yet.
@nebulardrifter @KateFantom @ecocars1 @FullyChargedShw The thing is, this has been thought about a great deal by 100's of people who are coming up with solutions. Plus it's not realistic to think of EV re-charging in the same way we buy liquid fuel. It's a completely different technology
If you're around this June and know someone who's skeptical about electric cars and renewable energy systems, drag them along to Silverstone for #FullyChargedLIVE  https://t.co/rbXw3ghEuS
@Ihnatko Thanks Andy!
@nebulardrifter @KateFantom @ecocars1 @FullyChargedShw I agree except it's not the majority of the population, according to well documented government figures 60% of UK households have off street parking. So 40% of UK residents have very good reasons not to have an EV yet. 60% don't.
@NigelPlaner1 Actually, now you mention it....
Tesla Model S that's bigger and lighter than the original! #FullyCharged  https://t.co/Jc9qQ8aaKq
@Broadsword999 @NGControlRoom @EnvAgency We don't need to build 3 gorges damn projects. We can produce modest but useful amounts of locally owned and consumed power with small scale turbine systems that could be installed at literally every weir
@jonty @NeaveEng @PPPRS @emfcamp Yes, that's right. Will get back to you ASAP
@RMcHattie @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @TeslaTed @QwestNorfolk @DrHindmarsh No, the car certainly doesn't buzz so now I'm going to listen again.
@Stewie73715241 It's basic mathematics I think. I was born in 1956. So if you subtract 1,956 from 2,018 you get a figure akin to 62.
@jakejustme76 I always like to understate, but agree, it's incredible.
We had a close up look at the only Tesla Model S shooting Brake (estate car)... in the world It's very nice https://t.co/Jc9qQ8aaKq
@garoo1980 @TeslaTed It's a very old term, not in common usage now. We would generally refer to a station wagon as an 'estate car.' I've got no idea why.
This week we will release more info on what's happening at #FullyChargedLIVE  (June 9 &amp; 10 at Silverstone) It's really turning into a must see clean tech, sustainable engineering event. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
The scale off this beast takes your breath away. #solongfossils https://t.co/Vc5RHmM04t
@Ephraim319A No, it's radio, no moving pictures
I was talking about the Young Ones yesterday. They're having a reunion on BBC Radio 4 in an hour or so. https://t.co/43Yk3CSOpL
@jakejustme76 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw @TeslaTed @QwestNorfolk @DrHindmarsh Ask @Carpervert He knows everything. I think it's an estate but I think a station wagon is an American term and it's an American car.
We get to drive the world's only Tesla Model S shooting brake. #FullyCharged With thanks to @TeslaTed  https://t.co/Jc9qQ8aaKq
Tesla shooting break on #FullyCharged  https://t.co/Jc9qQ8aaKq
Just been lurking around the #Jaguar #I-Pace on display at Westgate Oxford. It’s getting lots of positive attention https://t.co/JkJxsxUQB9
@The_PlugSeeker @KateFantom @ecocars1 @FullyChargedShw There's no way of knowing for certain at this stage but we've been getting a lot of interest from people outside the 'electric vehicle micro bubble.'
@Carpervert Ooh. You lucky chap.
@PeterEbdon OMG, I'm sorry, it's all my fault. Great news though.
That’s my balding head front row, slightly left. Other than that it was a fascinating event. https://t.co/oLMIOWKDOI
@andrewhockings @globalevrt @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan Seeing as a maximum of 4% of vehicles on UK roads have a plug, you are not only very normal but also very very welcome. Anyone who's actually interested is a hero in my book, especially Patreons.
Map: https://t.co/LTNVRuZn9D
There is a very special electric vehicle event that starts in Glasgow (I'll be there) and finishes at #FullyChargedLIVE  Details: https://t.co/U8mHuOfZwW
@sciorama My Mrs says that's every day, unless she's in a grump.
The next episode of #FullyCharged has been much anticipated. Coming soon. https://t.co/v0Z8B7b22O
If you want to find out more about electric cars, the future of the grid, generating your own electricity, storing it, using your own electricity when the grid is expensive etc. #FullyChargedLIVE is a good place to start. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
Also caught up with two EV Wonder Women. @She_sElectric and @JordeeGee https://t.co/Csm6fG91ub
Been at the House of Lords, the Autonomous and Electric Vehicle bill. I said nothing but learned loads. Very exciting and challenging times https://t.co/Ze2pgPKLG0
What the wha! https://t.co/F9TuoB9HHY
@markherenow @KateFantom @ecocars1 @IoniqEVDriver @YouTube Hmmm. I’ll be hanging on to my plugs for a while.
@ianvink You are very kind. I’ve made a note😊
@The_PlugSeeker @Lakerlikes @KateFantom @funinhounslow @FifteenMph @evcarmike @olddiesel @evmanuk @FullyChargedDan @ecocars1 @pluginadventure @ecarstrading @106Euan @ruralleafowner @can @She_sElectric We're meeting tomorrow. Small world
today we’re filming what happens to old electric car batteries when they’re ‘worn out.’  Strangely, contrary to an old Clarksonian prediction, they’re not ‘thrown away.’ @power_vault
@Parax We haven't been on Norway's electric ferries so no, you haven't missed that one. We do operate on a fairly restricted budget. Popping up to Norway for the 'bants' is still a little beyond us :-)
@Sparkie84 @BritishGT Indeed, so a great contrast. Silent and clean V very noisy and a bit smokey. #FullyChargedLIVE
Very excited about this. If you can make it to Silverstone on June 9th or 10th, it's going to be legend. (As my son would have said 10 years ago) #FullyChargedLIVE  https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp https://t.co/7Fi7rYCjA6
The single most disturbing image I have seen today. https://t.co/6cKpWfc5oX
@Spa_town Quite literally still amusing.
@ellardent Very cute!
@ITGeek123 @EverCharge @FullyChargedShw @OVOEnergy Yes. High on the list
@Darren_Fewins How did you find out!  Dammit that was secret!
@ITGeek123 @EverCharge @FullyChargedShw I wish. One day we’ll get to China.
Some good news at last :-) https://t.co/Ie8ZuS2sh1
So would we. Just need to get to Vancouver. https://t.co/o8u5zX7T4X
Like many, I'm really thrilled to see the UK has just gone through the longest period of zero coal being used to generate electricity. However, we still have a long way to go, we need heat as well as plugs. Not impossible, just a big challenge
#FullyChargedLIVE (9th-10th June - Silverstone) is shaping up nicely. Loads more updates in coming weeks but here's a start.  https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@leigh_craddock @HeatherLilh01 @CBarrieFans @DannyJohnJules @CCfunkandsoul Danny and I are doing very badly, that said, Chris is a legend
@rayrob78 There will be a Facebook group shortly. We're playing catch up.
@Mozz1camera Make sure you read the FAQ before you set off. Near zero charging facilities at Silverstone, plenty in surrounding area. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp
@Multi21Design (It will have been you)
@Banitsa This weeks episode, coming soon.
The best snippet of Royal reporting ever! https://t.co/UrI8ZxFUPi
The River Windrush. which I've lived next to for the last 26 years, has taken on iconic weight recently. Here's Jonathan Pie with a very gentle critique of current government policy. https://t.co/adwDiJUwam
Very iconic picture. And I've used that charger! https://t.co/fsfefYqqMd
@RobertYork1 The halls will be mostly domestic/battery/solar/chargers/eBikes/clean tech, outside and in pit garages will be cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes. We will post much greater detail in coming weeks #FullyChargedLive
@neilkelly101 No, that picture was taken at Pinewood, we used to be at Shepperton in the 1990's, now Pinewood
Have a look at what's happening on June 9th&amp;10th at Silverstone for #FullyChargedLive  This is going to be an epic clean tech event, it's growing so fast. https://t.co/i35NPyM1wp https://t.co/wdRpwwziAe

@Bjorn_Hosek @LarsBoelen @JohansVisie @LvNuenen @NeuTimmerwerken @NissanElectricC @Guayadesign @BSDGURU @AmazingChevVolt I want one of those for the Mrs' Prius. Excellent
@mdrayson Yes, early 2019
@NiallFoster No, I have been asked many times. I don't know who owns that Tesla
We mention Scott Pruitt in the most recent episode of #FullyCharged  If you want a little more background on this astonishing individual, have a look at this. https://t.co/XszHetsFiU
@mwt2008 I hope you're right. I think you are but I like to illustrate all the tech that isn't diesel.
@FreakyFwoof Sit back and henjoy de accents. :-)
Warning, some bad mime and silly accents, but mostly 'hard news' in latest #FullyCharged show, with a bit more info on #FullyChargedLIVE  https://t.co/qPdMMyTe3v
@designrecycle It is electric, Craig even plugged it in once! The world's gone mad!
@Darren_Fewins It was meant to be a Gloucestershire accent, so now I'm massively offended that you thought it was Cornish. That's very anti Glos. Typical of Cornish elitists.
What a lovely bunch of nutters. https://t.co/DwssZMMct1
@SomeGuyInAuxNZ The Bollinger is really the only plausible truck we've seen so far. Lots of talk but no product yet
And this. https://t.co/fCQKRJvH9p
Choice of two things to watch if you're not out on this beautiful evening. News update from me and @Carpervert  https://t.co/qPdMMyTe3v
@R_ViewMovies No, we've decided to go dog free for a while but one of the pups is going to live with a family just up the lane, and we've offered to dog-sit every now and then.
@garoo1980 @FullyChargedShw @nigelwickenden @Carpervert There has to be, might take a while :-)
@mcsmik When you get to the ticket buying page there's a choice at the top, Patreon supporter is one of the options, choose that. (I hope I've got that right, I bought a ticket to make sure it worked)
@nigelwickenden @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert Yes, very good point. I think there's plans brewing because we need to announce it a lot earlier. I'm guessing we'll see if we survive this one first. Signs are good
News update from @FullyChargedShw with @bobbyllew and @Carpervert  Contains some digger mime. https://t.co/qPdMMyBCEV
@samgoddard42 Sorry, not sure I understand, I don't 'believe' it, it's a simple matter of record that one producer in the BBC news organisation is a conservative. Nothing wrong with that at all, my criticism was of the alt-right 'BBC are commies' dull chant.
@tayne500 @Charles545587 @FullyChargedShw Venue scale, availability and affordability are the main reasons, we looked all over for a long time last year.
@spudsfanclub @lucycharl done, thanks for reminder
@lucycharl Ma'am, I've just had a communication due to an unusual anomaly in space-time informing me that on earth, today is a special commemorative event for you. So, Happy Birthday ma'am, I hope you have a wonderful day.  Best wishes, Kryten 2X4B 523P
@MKonopkus With a twitter handle like yours, I think not having an argument is a great time saver :-)
When you open a can of political worms on Twitter, the best response is to post a picture of a carpet of sleeping puppies. These are our dog Joey's offspring. Sadly he didn't live to see them. #socute https://t.co/fe9tbVGKMX
@edmundofludlow That's a very old quote, late 1990's. Guess what, it's changed.
How many 1,000’s of times have I been told ‘the BBC is full of lefty liberals, it’s totally biased.’ Yeah, right, Sands is a classic member of the loony left. LOLz https://t.co/tkxNMM0Q1A
Fascinating story. 1st headlines, (Daily Fail, Times etc)  'Hybrid Car Burns Down House when Plugged in to Charge.' Later it's revealed that's not quite what happened. Chilling. https://t.co/zq8NPacOJs
@vaipier Um, I don't know how else to explain it. If I'd charged the car and everything else from the grid, my consumption would have been large. It was zero, when there was high demand on grid (early evening) mine was still zero, so I guess that counts as negative?
@vaipier The house consumption just shows what's been consumed in the house, which includes the car charger. The negative element is consuming large amounts of power but not from the grid.
@evcarmike @FullyChargedShw @Carpervert @FullyChargedDan @InkSharkman @helenczerski @ecotricity @ChargemasterPlc @REAssociation @DriveElectricUK That's definitely one for @FullyChargedDan
@elecclassiccars @Carpervert Oh, hang on... it doesn't have to be Jonny. I can drive a bit :-)
@Mr__Gus @Tesla I'm pretty certain all of those will be on display, we will confirm nearer the time, but deffo loads of e-bikes
@yanquetino Top Gear magazine, might just have a slightly larger budget than us, that said, if there's any way we can get Jonny there we'll jump at the chance. Really good review from TGM.
@FelicityMorse It's the sudden burst of sunshine. Next week you'd be able to sit there for hours in the cold rain and no one would bat an eye. I can just about remember feeling a bit frisky on a spring day :-)
In case you missed my multiple tweets yesterday, here's the 1st announcement about Fully Charged Live, 9th-10th June, Silverstone. It's looking like it's going to be a hum-dinger of a show! https://t.co/drC1C77vVC
@FelicityMorse Isn't that lovely. So romantic. :-)
@Gromski The Tesla App, does the powerwall and the car. Very easy to use and understand.
@mwt2008 @FullyChargedShw @FullyChargedDan Both pretty much the same. Some subtle differences in planned talks but that's all developing and changing so either day is good.
@jakeyc 5.5 kWp. So quite big for average house but I'm charging cars a lot. Like now
@timhoward71 @Carpervert @FullyChargedShw We haven't released it yet, we're putting the finishing touches to it, coming very soon. It's very cool
@Disco_1999 What about the mower, the washing machine and the Gocycle. See, it's complicated.
I should have put the picture with my previous tweet. A picture says a thousand words, although this one need about 300 to explain it. https://t.co/4Ov04hc7u7

@janbartspang @pluginadventure @KateFantom @ecocars1 You need a miss sold PPI. Build a time machine, get a mortgage 25 years ago, pay for a wretched PPI like an idiot, find out you've got one. Boom.

@hughclaffey @meltymcface @She_sElectric @FullyChargedShw Yes, we'll supply living creatures, an apron and a big knife. Knock yourself out. :-)
@nuclearforus @Sklblue @doug_parr Keep napping in your little bubble sir.  Call me when internal combustion engines become even remotely efficient.
@meltymcface @She_sElectric @FullyChargedShw There will be vegan options. But you are still 'that guy.' :-)
@nuclearforus @Sklblue @doug_parr I've saved that tweet for historic reference. It's also very very funny. Well done.
@nuclearforus @Sklblue @doug_parr Without massive, gob smacking subsidies to fossil fuel companies, without utterly ignoring the external costs to society in general, health costs in particular, fossil burning inefficient cars would stop being used in months. Your arguments are merely amusing.
@Sklblue @doug_parr True, they charge so much a Tesla Model S is only a little more expensive than a Ford Focus, and the charging infrastructure is probs 10 years ahead of us, and we've doing quite well.
