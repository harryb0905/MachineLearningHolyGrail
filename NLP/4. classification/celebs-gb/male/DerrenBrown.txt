Last night a heckler shouted across 10,000 people gathered to hear Harris, Peterson &amp; Murray: ‚ÄòI just think we‚Äôre all being controlled by Derren Brown‚Äô. Thank you, whoever that was, it really made me laugh. Now üëèüëè you‚Äôre a chicken. And woah, your legs are wibbly-wobbly jelly.

True: I once had a small collection of Sundry Items Stolen From Celebrity Bathrooms. One section: Stars Of The Small Screen And Their Floss. Utterly disrespectful and bizarre.
Was once sat with pals in French bistro deliberating whether to steal a cup (I was at turning point towards honesty). Half hour back and forth with friend over ethics. Eventually didn‚Äôt take it. We left, &amp; his girlfriend produced the cup she‚Äôd stolen while we were discussing.
My Florence souvenir: coffee cup from Ditti Artigianale, favourite coffee place in Florence. Super cool if you‚Äôre passing. I used to steal espresso cups from fave cafes around the world but have now stopped. Quite a collection though.
@five_books that might be the wrong link?
Southend it is. Great job by @cityjet crew looking after us miserable lot.
Some have succumbed to claustrophobia. Infant behind me holding up very well, mother tirelessly chirping encouragements. Added element: we don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre flying to. Might have to re-route to Southend. Which I left at the end of the tour. What adventures.
French air traffic controllers, revelling in their nation‚Äôs victory, have refused to come to work tonight; a bunch of us trying to get to London are now stranded sweating at Pisa airport as a consequence after a scorching 3hr re-route from Florence. Friendly spirit still abounds.

@D_Cremin thank you! Where you have you all ended up?
@bysarahescott I do!
@DeafIrishInstns @SmokeNMirrorsAD think American Sign Language is similar, just a little louder.

And last night watched &amp; adored Michael Haneke‚Äôs latest film, Happy End. If you don‚Äôt know him, give Funny Games a try. Great fun first date movie, it‚Äôll stay with you.
Well first book I‚Äôve read in one entranced session on the Kindle, from e-cover to e-cover: The Myth Gap by @alexevansuk. Terrific thoughts around climate change from a man who has worked in the thick of govt policy making.
(May or may not include the waiter).
A bit in love with the Cork accent and everyone who speaks it.
Thank you for your questions! My Kindle (the Oasis, as many of you inferred), was in fact buttons-to-the-right! To all those of you who wondered if indeed I had orientated my Kindle (Oasis) with buttons to the right, I say YES! + you were in same position as said buttons (right).
On the train and now taking questions from Twitter about the orientation of my Kindle. Fire away.
Impressive and brilliant staff @FitzwilliamBEL, thank you all. Today train rides to Cork with my gorgeous touring gang. What joy. Belfast you were extraordinary. Everyone tells me I won‚Äôt understand anyone in Cork. Everyone. An intriguing week awaits.

@AlexWilliams_97 aww sorry!
If you were the Octopus guy tonight, I want you to know that your flies were wide open for the whole thing. Some of you will know what that mean and it isn‚Äôt as rude as it sounds. I was (ahem) good enough not to mention it...
@92degreescoffee you bet. Thank you so very much. I have all the best equipment at home and am barista trained so it won‚Äôt go to waste.  Hope Vari made it. X

First night of my, um, 16th year of touring. In Liverpool - and for regulars, don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs the delightful Royal Court, not the Empire. Can‚Äôt wait. X

My fun thought process at parties: 1. Oh there‚Äôs so-and-so 2. I‚Äôve met them a few times and they‚Äôre really nice 3. Better not talk to them. Hard to trust that most people are thinking the same. And that it‚Äôs not a fear of talking to people, it‚Äôs a desire to talk properly to them.
Daytimes rehearsing Underground, evenings editing a (brand) new Netflix special for later in the year. Wonderful things but ready to collapse. Thusly off to my tiny faraway cosy cabin with fire and books and dogs before starting the tour on Monday. Squeeze ya later x
@BarryF_inMurphy and only borderline outrageous.

Wonderful hour-long chat with cabbie yesterday on way to rehearsals. A real lesson to put phone away and be more open to conversation. I realise I am not doing this right now.
.@Reynolds Not so hard. A big general release form is signed very early on, covering everything. Don‚Äôt think we use anything terribly special. But we also have people involved watch the show before it‚Äôs signed off to make sure they‚Äôre ok with it.
@garethdivitini Jeremy CORDEN, you big silly.
Well if it isn‚Äôt first day of rehearsals for Underground. Plus we have a new guy to relentlessly tease, torture and tickle for 3 months. His life will be hell.

I have ducked away to a coastal hotel for a few days while The Push ‚Äòdrops‚Äô on Netflix (apparently and ironically, that‚Äôs the word). Whilst a new audience makes of me what they will, few will suspect I am in my new cardy eating chips by the fire, somewhere near Bournemouth.

This is tweet 15,001.  Early afternoon editing the (brand) new Netflix special for later in the year, and then talking with @RevRichardColes on Christian @PremierRadio about life &amp; meaning. Now it is home to slippers and the steadfast flatulence of a beagle-cross.
Miranda Richardson is staggering in Stronger. She steals the show from an already phenomenal cast. Just wonderful.
@philosophybites or is it just your reputation/situation that can be harmed without you feeling it? Discovering the long term affair everyone knew about etc but then not caring. I‚Äôd say I wasn‚Äôt harmed but at best my reputation was. Only my harm if I take it as such. (Whadiknow)
