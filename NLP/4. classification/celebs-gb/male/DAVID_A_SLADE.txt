So wait, we don’t want to televise cinematography and editing nominations but we’re keeping best original song and I assume watching all those artists perform them?  Surely it would be less disastrous for the Academy’s standing with film makers if the awards ran long?
I think it sends the wrong message to the filmmakers of tomorrow to suggest that some areas of film making craft have less value than others. Form is substance. Skilled and considered craft leads to great CINEMA. Without it you just have moving pictures. @TheAcademy
