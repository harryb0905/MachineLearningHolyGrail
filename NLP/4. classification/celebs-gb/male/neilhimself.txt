@TeezaT78 Why is it an insult to say that I toned the House on the Rock down to make it probable? When  people read the first version of the chapter, they thought I was making it all up. So I left bits out until they started to believe it.
You can read my story from AARGH!, drawn by Bryan Talbot and inked by Mark Buckingham at https://t.co/LhGt0rFNT9
They did? https://t.co/cW7LpuQ0vm

The House on the Rock is real. In fact we toned it down to make it probable. https://t.co/17vCafKMNI
@PontiusPython Thank you so much!
@FormerlyPete @DavidSouth1980 There were some terrific casting decisions.
@PVBuk I won’t be showrunner.
I know. It’s sad. https://t.co/cKY5ETTOgj
@DavidSouth1980 Yes. I wish I’d had the power to say No to about half a dozen major decisions in the show.

High winds tonight. Inside the house, windows rattle and doors slam as if there are people breaking in or running from room to room. Outside the house the wind chimes are ringing like alarm bells.
@JohnCirilli1 Interesting. Not this Gaiman.
@LuisJaimePena @IamKeck I’m glad it was liberated by someone who wanted it.
@__wtfox__ Not yet.
@Ella98842219 I love gothic texts (see Forbidden Brides); Coraline owes something to Lucy Clifford’s The New Mother, but it’s not like The Monk or Otranto.
@nrohluap They would both love it for different reasons...
@StuNess85 That's the original American text. They did a lot of find and replace.
@KittoKattoKatsu I did! And Tampere later. And finally Helsinki.
It’s a remarkable album. https://t.co/72ruPNkUfK
@DaleMethod It came as a bit of a surprise to me. I'm still figuring out what I think.
I'm so glad. https://t.co/hzglYxta5n
@PollyPanic @amandapalmer @zoecello They've done that too. Look at @theagilmore's patreon post about touring with babies and small children...

@Alies34759684 Well, post-Twitter you have The Graveyard Book, Ocean at the end of the Lane, Sandman: Overture, Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader, Fortunately the Milk, Norse Mythology, The View from the Cheap Seats and others, so your sampling size is big enough.
@BackstageRider Laugh? I don't know. Marvel, definitely Night Watch.

@Ryanpfreeman @joss @timminchin Madness!

@joss @timminchin You can’t just keep encouraging random fans like that. They’ll think you mean it. I mean, what if Tim gets seduced by your politeness and actually plunges into show business?
@NiamhAWalsh I’ll send over more hedgehog recipes.
@biltmoretweets That’s funny sad.
@ubergine They came back as damaged by the box load. And Avon realised it was a failure as book designs went.

@localnotail Oh yes.
@Awe3 I just keep going. You get to the end eventually.
Listening to Amanda on NPR Live From Here. It's beautiful. It's also making little Ash melt down completely. He's suddenly realized she's not here.
@AlexIsAlright @ActuallyNPH @NeilDiamond @NASA I agree. But he is no longer with us.
@PipkinsJoshua Mostly the ones who succeed are the ones who just keep going. Write the next book or story. And the one after that.

You are so welcome. The Ballantine Adult Fantasy line shaped who I was. And shaped @EllenKushner and @StevenBrust and so many of our contemporaries. It was the only place to find stuff. I just counted over 40 books that I loved &amp; might not have discovered: https://t.co/Rv2j00az94 https://t.co/8ViciD0eyY

@Siddian42 Think about it. Play with it. Try and find a way in.
An astounding obituary for an astonishing woman. I was most of the way through it when I realised how much I owe to the Ballantines and their Modern Fantasy line: Cabell, Mirlees, Dunsany, Bramah, so many magical authors &amp; books brought back into print.   https://t.co/d2wWZk7xp5
@WordSpores There's a short story waiting to be written.
@Danielaltiere Go for a walk with a notebook and without a phone.
@DemanAndrew I’m so glad. Chris and I have been friends for over 30 years, and I’ve felt that he was underappreciated, so it was a delight to see you putting him deservedly into the spotlight.
@heathermoon017 I don't think so.  It's not very good.
@joss Sending love. And no small amount of envy.
@phosfiendish @gerardway Very proud of him. Long ago he was a baby assistant editor at Vertigo. So his meteoric rise has taken decades of hard work. (I wrote the intro to Umbrella Academy Dallas about ten years ago.)

@Michaelrm62968 Warhol had no influence on the music, apart from advising them to keep the dirty words in.  Nico arrived and left, and the story of that has varied with each book I’ve read.  Lou &amp; the band certainly resented her to some degree.  Velvets pre/post Warhol sound like the same band.
@harpweaving Cabal. Lola is alive and well and living in Adelaide with @CarolynLake
@QuietDudeHere @austinelder516 Probably the Narnia books.  I read them monthly as a kid.
@Michaelrm62968 The Velvets definitely used the Warhol connection and management to get a leg up. The Monkees were cast to be in a band, in which everything but the vocal tracks were already written and recorded.  Not sure how the two things compare.
In our punk band, when I was 16, we did “(I’m not your) Stepping Stone” and it was the punkiest of punk songs. (Right @geoffnotkin ? @mrgrahamksmith?) https://t.co/VuJFLJB4FD
@mirpvose I can do good with it. And sometimes it keeps me company on trains.
No. https://t.co/FJsoEYscJy
@Michaelrm62968 How was the Velvet Underground manufactured? They existed prior to Warhol and after Warhol.
Odd and sad that this hasn’t been picked up by the National Press. It would be depressing to think that the NC Police have committed another  homicide without consequences. https://t.co/oj1F3Ep9JF
@JHWilliamsIII Agreed!
They did. https://t.co/J7f3qG6Bjl

@silviamg @nkjemisin My favourite was being told off for not understanding Southern Culture as the food being eaten after the funeral in Anansi Boys was the kind of food people ate in Jamaica.
And carefully deployed Comic Sans. https://t.co/vVOMEkjqp8
@StuartMaddison @GoodOmensPrime @DavidGArnold I’m surprised. I thought Londoners above all people could spot Centre Point.
@cheeringchan Thank your mother for me.
@TheFluffyNope @masterclass I’m so glad.
Whoa. https://t.co/8oKDNjF84g
@wandringmermaid As I learned when my 3 year old bought a bunch of thrillers, they will let you return them.

@Rotas @terryandrob It means "Lost". Heroine of Shakespeare's Winter's Tale.
@RachelRoseReid @CherylMorgan Of course! Silence sounds absolutely fascinating.

@DorieDeats I’m so glad!
@venerablemom Thank her for me.
Happy director. Happy writer. Actors doing proper actor faces. https://t.co/OahcPCQiND
@DorieDeats That's gorgeous.
@LifeIsAmazingUK Of course!
@WingsMoose Just me. Growing up in Purbrook Gardens.
@GrimCreak I hope so.
@xiankiefer @viet_t_nguyen Where does New Sun do that? I just finished a re-read and was impressed by how deeply everything is bedded in from the very start.
@murreyb All the adults in that story trouble me.
@viet_t_nguyen @xiankiefer It’s not in iambic pentameter though. Although there’s a Poul Anderson novel that is.

Stumbled home at 3:00am on February the 15th after four days on the West Coast talking American Gods and Good Omens to journalists. I'm losing my voice and coughing and very tired. Amanda had left me soup in the kitchen, and I have never felt more loved. #ValentinesDay
@jcallen66 @PrimeVideo @GoodOmensPrime @drmuig You are going to have to explain exactly what you feel was in bad taste here, and why, then, I'm afraid.
Good lord. https://t.co/XCqCYdbZjQ
@synapsesmoothie Well, you've got a character but not a story. Think of another character who wants something your first character also needs or wants. Put them together.
@Gaitoune Yup.

@Pequena_Poney20 Hello Daniel.
I thought I was going to be a hard science fiction writer. I thought I was a failure in my early twenties because I didn't seem to be one of them. https://t.co/HMve4y7rfH
@MrAdamRex 1) Ash's favourite book is Pssst! 2) I was able to tell this to your sister Amanda the other night because she was our server. (Or, alternately, you are being stalked from a distance by someone who convincingly claims to be your sister.)
@MrAdamRex Yup. They have had an idea. I am to write the book. We will split the money 50/50.
@Davis_404 Yup. (He shows up in Charles G Finney's wonderful The Circus of Dr Lao.)
Yes -- but you have until May 31st. https://t.co/z1rIlXD1mF
@doctorow @GreatDismal Terry Pratchett told me that the Maggi deal was done by Mr Heyne himself. Over the protests of his staff. And with the result that many book deals were voided by authors and the rights taken back by the authors.
@chattering_nuns Honestly, I could not ask for a finer or more tuneful order of Satanic nuns.
@MJMcKean Awwwww.
@CityPotts @EricIdle @Nidan787 @BanjoHfuhruhur That redundant “possibly” just grates...
If you are very sharpeyed you may see me in episode 4, and if you are very sharpeared you might hear me in episodes 4 and 5. https://t.co/Dr5QRJfxHk
@neilgbrasil THAT WOULD BE @DCComics
@SnitchesWitch @verge @amazon @TerryPratchett The entire show is dedicated to Terry.
@leotavaneiro No. I was at my most involved in Season 1 episodes 1-4, as I had time then. I’ve been working on Good Omens full time since the spring of 2017.
Best headline ever. https://t.co/Pdle61WtsN
Yes. I am now a retired show runner. https://t.co/xMmRMgzpQS
I am not saying that if you follow the @chattering_nuns that secrets will be vouchsafed to you. I’m just saying that a lot of people figured out the May 31st GOOD OMENS date before it was announced because the Chattering Order of St Beryl are a bit chattery...
@jana_walk No pressure.
@Marilov10 I agree about monopolies. But given that American Gods is with Starz and Good Omens made with the BBC, I’m not seeing a monopoly here.
@slbarrett87 @BJ_Porch @eevilmidget Absolutely.
Six episodes and then out https://t.co/EIyOzVz1J2
@slbarrett87 @BJ_Porch @eevilmidget I think it’s a more than legitimate question, and am really interested in the answers.
@xiankiefer Dune Messiah, yes. You can retire after that.
@DanaSchwartzzz Like the tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra, that is something for which the world is not yet ready.
@xiankiefer There’s a moment in Dune Messiah where he ponders how disappointing it is that Hitler, being meant to have killed millions,  didn’t do it personally.  Like Paul did.
@xiankiefer I’m not seeing anything off in your description of the book.  But you seem to think that Frank Herbert doesn’t know that that’s what the book is about. As subsequent books make clear, he did. Paul is the protagonist but is not presented as anyone to be emulated or endorsed.
@DanaSchwartzzz Your “author reading their own book” photos are better than mine. I’m not jealous. I bet I could pull off the “mad scruffy old homeless person reading his book“ look better than you would.

@jcallen66 @PrimeVideo @GoodOmensPrime Given that @drmuig directed Benedict in the Emmy award winning Victorian episode of Sherlock, we felt it was a  legitimately tasteful joke.
@TinyLioness Could be either. Or be from having kids around.
@skippybkroo @GoodOmensPrime @PrimeVideo And I can't wait for you to see it!
@skippybkroo @GoodOmensPrime @PrimeVideo I'm very gently suggesting you are misremembering. I promise no dates have ever been offered for Good Omens because until it was finished, no dates were ever set.
@crashmatlander @eversmann_ @PrimeVideo Yes.
@skippybkroo @GoodOmensPrime @PrimeVideo No, it really wasn't. It was advertised as coming in 2019.
@una_10bananas @Aliceisa99 @GoodOmensPrime @PrimeVideo According to an Irish newspaper, May 31 is still spring on either of the two ways of calculating it. https://t.co/SmWuo2M0Dn

@Twig55356353 @PaulWitcover People cry sometimes when they meet people who made art that moved them. It's not an overreaction or thing fetishism. It's emotional connection.

@kelukelugames @MarkWaid Sorry.
@IAmEthanHealey @StephenKing Of course. (About 6 years ago I interviewed @StephenKing for the Sunday Times. It’s in The View From the Cheap Seats.)
@xiankiefer Dune Messiah is worse.
@ancientlyric @writingben Excellent.

@sisonsoflove I suspect it would. Real stories are still stories.
@fluffymason @stephenfry It was definitely Blackadder, although I remembered it as a Baldrick line. And attributed to Stephen or Ben because I remember Ben talking about which of them had done it first but cannot recall who it was.
@katiedidwhat @stephenfry It doesn't. It's something else.

This is also quicker and easier than having me come round your house and tell you the stories. https://t.co/3fV3ix2C2P
@WhenItDiesThere Might I gently point out there is no “expression of home” when a house is built by a self declared flipper, not to live in but to do up and sell?
@WhenItDiesThere Because ...they quote John Donne?
@fox_worx And if that had been done to the house by a family who had moved in with the goal of living there, I would have kept my mouth shut. But it’s been perpetrated by a self-declared flipper, trying to anonymise it for a quick sale. It’s sad, and makes the world less interesting.
@fox_worx I’m pretty sure I’m allowed to have opinions about architecture and design. Most of them are about trying to maintain the character/feel of old buildings. The one on the right feels like someone spraypainted a Victorian painting white, and replaced a gilt frame with a walmart one
@WhenItDiesThere No man is an island.

@ancientlyric @mj_cavanaugh @AwYeahComicsNY It may still be on the web. Or on the way back machine if it isn't. Just Google.
@ancientlyric @BardCollege @masterclass I'm still happily on the @BardCollege faculty.
@CraigWa94275839 Congratulations! And good luck!
@mdj6248 Of course. Take a look at the introduction and all will be explained.
@MorchapOk Lots of long conversations on the phone and then a mad dash to get to the next good bit before the other one could.
@SerenaSonoma @PinballWitch Huge grin. Ah well. In the meantime there are lots of videos, and about 3 million words of blog and tumblr much of it on writing. And that’s all for free.
BRISTOL! https://t.co/yCx85c2Lqk
This is kind and cool. I hope it goes to someone who appreciates it. https://t.co/KbEnGzlbcj
@BobsollySolly Sounds like a plan. Good luck with the writing!
@mdj6248 Very much so. Where were you reading it? In Fragile Things there's an introduction where I talk about how much I owe to Lafferty.
@MHJimenez8 Please give your mother my love. And I will see you in class.
Very wise. But we shall see what we can do... https://t.co/kPampwYsaK
@TubunMuzuru @HilaryWrites I'm glad to be able to tell you that it's as much about short stories as it is about other ways of telling stories.
@zrog89 Thank you!
@HilaryWrites Sorry.  But do not worry. I will only invade your feed until the next MasterClass author arises...
@xylocaina Hang in there....
@LairdsAV @GoodOmensPrime I point this information at @drmuig
@HieronymusMcG @anna_schlaht @ironicteachings Three seasons. Winter, the fourth of July and Roadmending.
@babette_babich She had every right to be drunk and to be grumpy. But that's her story, not mine.
So sorry to hear this. 27 years ago, I had a perfect dinner with delightful Albert Finney and Alice Cooper. It ended with Albert introducing us to a very drunk and glum Grand Dame of British Theatre, who had just lost a major award. (I was too intimidated to do any talking.) https://t.co/OavUYnGsXq

Listen to ⁦⁦@levarburton⁩ Read one of my favourite short stories LIVE! in New Jersey: "Driftglass" by Samuel R. Delany https://t.co/PTm3cFt4rf
If I remember correctly it's also a really good conversation about Good Omens, because I was in the middle of writing the TV series, and it's where my head was. https://t.co/tZnWtMnrIp
@kiityc @Net_Metalrat @CptTangerine @terryandrob Not to mention what we were planning for sequels that we could use now.

Fascinating thread. And goodnight. https://t.co/nK6c8Ks7pk
@PTFilm I'm so glad I said the right thing, then. And that you made the films.
@laurieinseattle Sorry -- take it as a year's reading. Or a few years' reading, then. Nothing's compulsory.
@readonthebeach @alphabeticallie I read @alphabeticallie's recent timeline. I'm so sorry. Sending love, and condolences.
@PTFilm You could always make a new address just for that.
@CyrusSabet Sounds good.
@CyrusSabet That would work.

@cockedeyebrow @GuardianBooks Overall the Guardian is way ahead of, for example, the Daily Mail in the True News stakes.  And they may well have been duped: https://t.co/Ade1NHkluQ
@EmilyCadwalader Good job.
@cockedeyebrow @GuardianBooks No, I actually am doing a web chat.
@Lily_Wholockian There is no wrong edition. Do not worry.
It won't premiere there, no.  But we will show clips. https://t.co/tKwylE5scG
@Lily_Wholockian Bigger. 4 of them instead of 2. Scripts etc.
I'd forgotten about this. I should have just re-posted it, instead of teaching the @masterclass. https://t.co/0gxhFBWhTp
@rushumushu @GuardianBooks As do I.
@herebemonsterss I was a journalist, so I was a full time writer even then.
@avrildulac It never was.  It's one of those things Amazon uses as a placeholder, like the mysterious "Neil Gaiman Middle Grade Novel".
I have some in my office I have not dared to unbox yet... https://t.co/esI4p0hYbl
@mbquilts I tend to use Lamy 2000s as a novel writing pen. They aren't good signing pens.  That's a Pilot 823, favourite signing pen.
@brainpicker Such a sweet, funny, nice, smart woman. I'm so sorry to hear that she's gone, Maria.
@rushumushu @GuardianBooks The only year I've promised to come was this year, and I cancelled because I was still in the process of making Good Omens, and leaving to go anywhere in the final two weeks of getting it over the finishing line would have made it very late, and been unfair to my collaborators.
@Soc_of_Authors I always mute trolls. I like the idea of them shouting into the void.

@DrippyHippy @jackthorne I was always taught that selling children is wrong, no matter what pace you do it at.
@shutdownSETI @ifiknowcrazy @loungingjaguar That's for books pre-publication. Both things are true. Publishers take blurbs wherever they can find them.
@Gorlockza @drmuig @MJMcKean Alas.  This will never happen.
I'm so very glad. https://t.co/f0zGB1wUdW

@connielaelwood You are welcome.
@DrewMelbourne It was his fourth movie. His first three were at the Regent St Cinema in London where they do children’s films on Sunday morning, and it’s all kid friendly.  He did really well with two out of three of those. (The corpse bride was too scary and he decided to leave. )
@Hamstertron "an untidy, slovenly woman".
@ShakespearSauce @masterclass I won’t. I hope you enjoy the class.
@cruellxdxvil They are right!
I took Ash (age 3) to see Mary Poppins Returns today. I was 3 when I was taken to see the original Mary Poppins. He was entranced and delighted.  I was an emotional mess, in the best way.
That’s sad... https://t.co/RlenNyMcwi
I’m so glad. https://t.co/s6TKs2rnMX
@tomjoewood Yes.
@RichardDue @terryandrob Excellent word. It’s either in Good Omens proper (when Anathema meets Newt) or in the Witchfinder Card we made for Gollancz...
I think it would work for any of those groups, but they'd get different things from it. https://t.co/hRYiCHVLRl
@RichardDue @terryandrob Um... It's a nice and slightly archaic word, common in Victorian fiction. I don't remember which of us put it into Good Omens, though.
@envanligtrist You are so welcome!
@jaydeadams It's me!
Jayde is hilarious in a tiny role in Good Omens. My only regret about finishing up and coming home was not getting to see her show. https://t.co/OQe89qudgp

@Anachrontopian The hunour in Monty Python is absolutely based on life. The joy is in recognising normal people in abnormal situations and extraordinary people in normal situations. Boosh is at its best when it does something very similar.
@AndrewBober I think you were making a joke, but I can't figure it out. Explain?
@Phalchemy8 Amanda's in Boston shooting a rock video. I'm very excited to see her but that won't be for a few days. Right now I'm excited that I'll see Ash in less than an hour.
@fiddlersgreen92 @veschwab That's so sweet. But whoever told you I don't sign softcovers fibbed. I'll happily sign anything, if it means something to the person who has it. I'm so glad it made your teacher happy.
@kellysue @sparrow_specs @veschwab You are cool.
@TristanOfield I'm so glad you enjoyed it!
@kellysue @sparrow_specs @veschwab It's true. I don't remember following up like that with anyone else who turned up at a signing.
In a car, on my way home, after a month away, and having spent the best part of the last two years making Good Omens. It feels odd, the idea that it's almost done. And I am so very happy at the idea that I will see Ash in about 2 hours.
@ronniemick Probably, yes. Memoirs have ideas and honesty and characters in them.
@laguiri Always.

@IsaacWillis8 I don’t know.  It couldn’t hurt.
@damiengwalter Well, yes. And Sherlock Holmes and Allan Quartermain and Little Women, Huck Finn and Oliver Twist were in the minds of the Edwardians.  And they influenced the 20th Century.  But they were still from another time. No?
@kavyahh I’m very fond of my bit still: https://t.co/rNSyHnirPL
If they ever ask me and if I have the time. https://t.co/1gPay6ep2t
@damiengwalter I think they all are.  They are like popular Victorian fictions in Edwardian England.  I think that when the 21st C fiction comes along, we will know.

It was my fault they were grumbling. I was taking up a lot of room.

@sparrow_specs @veschwab @kellysue I’ve been impressed with @kellysue since I met her at a signing (I was signing, she was in line) in about ‘97. She has remained as nice and as real as she was back then.
@ribblefizz Yup. She did. But was rescued.
@pseupseudio @kikuchiyoali @Refugees I found the thread baffling. But I assume that whatever is upsetting her probably isn’t me.

@paulettya @MitchBenn @amandapalmer @thedoodlefoxx Later in the Spring. I hope. We have to finish it first.
@LifeIsAmazingUK @CDirdal @GeriCarr Do a new tweet and I’ll Plug it again for you.
@MitchBenn @amandapalmer @thedoodlefoxx You need to write children’s books.
@mlberry @peterstraubnyc @StephenKing I love NO BED FOR BACON and THE SPACE MERCHANTS...
@HaylieAWriter @Mementh It’s Gaiman’s Law. It always happens. Always...
@CHawksRun @masterclass I think it would be fine for her.
@wayfarer1951 @masterclass Er, yes. That was the point.
@openmoments @BBCRadio4 No. It finished for the whole world.
@janeen_mathisen Nobody came. They couldn’t, there was a Halloween parade in the way. They all turned up as it was ending.
@RR_Wondering @masterclass I’m glad you want to take it again. We learned a lot from the feedback!
@DMDworks That’s so kind of you. Thank you.
@Jen_wales It’s okay. I’m glad you asked, for the people who really can’t afford it ever.
@nikodemmalec93 I hope so. I tried to build it so that it would be good for the curious and for the experts.
@cpmcclennan @amandapalmer @alyankovic That’s the wonderful @jasonwebley
@holdengraber Sounds too good to be true: seeing narcissistic used like that in 1920 strikes me as wrong.
@girlvsplanet Meeting and making friends with a young lady with cancer. She’s a poet. We invited her to set, as her doctors didn’t expect her to live long enough to see Good Omens, but right now theres a really good chance she’ll see it and enjoy it. She’s been an inspiration.
@girlvsplanet My favourites right now are a kid’s book called Pirate Stew, and Neverwhere The Seven Sisters. Nobody has seen them yet. One of them isn’t even finished. They are my children before they go out into the world.
@Obby_Oss @masterclass Mister Clever!
@girlvsplanet Two questions on Twitter now.
Yes. https://t.co/78TZzzsxjo
@angela_rashida I hope you enjoy it!
@NanNightCut @HamillHimself @oohgaryc I'm afraid not. I don't advertise things like this to 2.5million people.
@Jantar23 @iloveweirdbooks @masterclass I trust @masterclass will help
@amandapalmer You won the socks battle?
Thank you! I'm so glad it's helping! https://t.co/Gx5Xvrt4vV
@amandapalmer @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti Yes dear.
I answered it long ago. They haven't come for me yet.  https://t.co/oXihhBNahI https://t.co/BsAb8TKvTA
It's mutual. You were irreplaceable. https://t.co/7wl1Y6KC7L
Sure. https://t.co/aA7bGAGMOE
For anyone who is in the Neil Gaiman (me) MasterClass. https://t.co/Z09MW2F8P0
I'm so pleased it's working for you. https://t.co/BIUSxd9SQP
I'm so sorry to hear this. I loved St Mark's Comics. (I did the single worst NY signing ever there, almost 30 years ago, because someone thought Halloween during the parade was a good time for a signing at St Mark's Comics. And I still loved it.) https://t.co/4PFUuJtbVw
@jillsh3 It is me.
@p_l_white @masterclass There is. And my blog is there at https://t.co/RIyfTVgpK3 and it's all there too for free.
@eumateimufasa_ You can, but you'd be wrong.
Nope. I wanted to write Terry’s Death, or a Death a lot like Terry’s, anyway. One that talked in block capitals. And Terry was happy to let me. https://t.co/g6KBKuqIp9
@SogtonKottr @nottrobin @masterclass It’s not gone. MasterClass will be up there for a little while, and the the UNHCR  @Refugees  video will get pinned back again. But right now it’s easiest to give people a MasterClass link.
It’s up now, today. https://t.co/wbRWg81ICq
@ChristellRBG It’s up now. Today.
@5AMM7 Keep going. Finish then fix.
I’m so glad. And relieved that people like it so much. https://t.co/SSiROEBnOC
@camcombs @masterclass @MargaretAtwood Yes. @MargaretAtwood is amazing.
@MarisaStoller @wordxword I love the Redwoods.
@danguyf Do it!
@ZehraFazal @TheDCUniverse That's wonderful!
@clemwl @masterclass That starting anywhere is more important than not starting until it’s right.
@georgiawetheral I hope you enjoy it!
@AgeCaves You are welcome. I didn’t do anything good until I was about 27 anyway.
@mochachick8 Terry was wise.
@Rapieress Thank you!
@stuwest So would I.
@DwDunphy He did.
In which Michael Zulli and I tell a story about an evil showman. It’s a sort of a Bradbury meets Alice Cooper sort of thing, and I am still fond of it.  Now on the Humble Bundle along with 10,000 pages of comics... for an excellent cause. https://t.co/mxUmYVNODb

@_yakeel I’m wearing a grey tee shirt.
No. Blogger used to tell you. https://t.co/zlPSELmE6S
@Olanthea @masterclass Be even better than that. Be you.
Definitely. My blog at https://t.co/RIyfTVgpK3 has about two million words on it, lots of them about the process of writing, and it's a great place to start. https://t.co/EYe3q816s3
So happy people are enjoying it. https://t.co/WDYxGnxRSg
@ChrisEGallop We are leaving. What do we have to offer? A negotiation is meant to benefit both sides. Are we going to offer them something new that they want, to change the deal?

@limeybastard55 @PeterColeborn @clivebarkerinfo @ramseycampbell1 @DennisEtchison1 I remember him!
@jherekbischoff @amandapalmer @Miriam_Curzon Yes.
@RichardGoldman6 You are so very welcome. And, because you missed it: https://t.co/6svfyHzswm
Alas, no. It’s about telling and writing stories. That’s what I do on the side. https://t.co/JrtNwJ95Pe
True. https://t.co/bRMWtKPJzB
@RichardGoldman6 He must have bought several for friends, because he sent me the CD as a gift.  And enthused on the phone about how much he loved all the songs especially No Cows Allowed. (I loved Airport Parking Lot and All of Her Girlfriends and Zsa Zsa...)
People are asking how long my MasterClass will be up for... https://t.co/6Pec1PBizU
@christetro That's fabulous.
@NotQuiteCool @masterclass We talked on the phone about what sort of areas I wanted to cover. They liked them. A month later they put a camera in front of me and asked me a few questions, I took a deep breath and started to talk.
@LeviRedrook I am!
@amandastern @masterclass @shondarhimes @SteveMartinToGo And you are very clever.
@alicialutes I know. I know.
@SPlatizky I don't know.
Not really sorry.... https://t.co/0pu0a8vnpN
@MadBastard_v2 Not at all. That would be very ahistorical. He's wearing them in ancient Rome.
@Clarkey9 @terryandrob Kind of.
Salutaria! https://t.co/KaBBWpXSoD
@ActualLiam @Terryinindy @damiengwalter @dduane I did. I even interviewed Harry about it, when I was 23...
Probably No Bed For Bacon or The Space Merchants. https://t.co/Uq1uaylnLn
@dan_steely @amandapalmer @smoknbobjd Don't give her ammunition, Chris!
@mtn_peach It's a quote I gave @MarlonJames5 after finishing the book.
One thing at a time! https://t.co/IG7e0QuuqF
Stories are an essential part of who we are. They are lies that are truer than facts. In my new @MasterClass, I’ll show you how the best fiction helps you find your own truth: find your voice, your characters, and the new worlds you’ll build. Join me here: https://t.co/fo1teitVbu
@SanitariumLit Thank you! Talk to @ToGaiman who will know where it will need to be sent to get to me!
@toksvig @terryandrob He really was.
It probably isn't.  But dear lord, it was so much fun for us to write. And there's enough stuff in the book to have kept me busy making it into TV, as  @terryandrob had wanted, for the last two years. https://t.co/SzvejQfrbK
@RaeLynFox @DavidGArnold Clever.
@drawnonglass @amandapalmer @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti I'm pretty sure I don't have 1,870 socks.
@amandapalmer @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti The Joy of Socks is yours.
@amandapalmer @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti Yes, but you said you were doing it with 1,870 socks. Which is 935 pairs of socks. That's not just the extra socks, or the other box of socks or even the ones I'm bringing home. 935 pairs of socks mean I will be in negative sock numbers and thus #barefootandsockless
@amandapalmer @realstdunstan @marksandspencer @michaelfranti Socks before marriage and socks after marriage are two very different things, aren't they?
@amandapalmer @realstdunstan @marksandspencer I will walk barefoot and sockless through the world.
@lautaro_fm Both are right.
I think I lost it long ago. https://t.co/sbAfwKqugZ
@LifeIsAmazingUK It’s on my desk in the hotel. I’ll try and do a photo of me with it , for you.
@MelHardingShaw Not yet.
But. My socks. https://t.co/klIJJ5YGm4
@LaurynIpsum @amandapalmer I have four including the one with me.
@amandapalmer Is one of them the tiny battery operated one I bought so that I could travel straight up to Edinburgh last summer from the cutting room,  without going back to the hotel? That’s not actually a Sonicare toothbrush.
@dustyshockley @amandapalmer That’s assuming that she does not have two. Or that Ash does not have two.
@amandapalmer Are these all mine? Or are you including your toothbrushes and Ash's in the count?
@Dwam @jukeboxjunkie88 @JulieAMcDowall @robmcd85 I'm glad.
@WillHemlepp Back in the days when his name was synonymous with "A producer you may have heard of..." And not with alleged sexual assault. Yes.
@C_Barrington_ Brilliant.
@JonKehoe I worry that the wumpires would stop being funny if they went on too long.
@RCG_GPD @Nick_Offerman None of us do.
@GrayStateFan @MJMcKean I think it's the one where he goes on a blood fuelled rampage through Brixton with old people.
There was so much love in this video. https://t.co/Tzs6IXUjlC
@Beelzebuckie Neverwhere. Or Sandman, if you like graphic novels.
@Dwam @jukeboxjunkie88 @JulieAMcDowall @robmcd85 Is that true of the novels and the short stories? Or just one or the other?
@IlsleyCarol I’m glad.
You are welcome. I am still proud of this writing. https://t.co/gv7KvCwoWL
I am genuinely nervous about listening to this one. https://t.co/Mds8SxJglW
I still love that story and what Eddie did with it. https://t.co/JGnbV0YfRv
Not this year. Not until something vaguely related to something I had something to do with is nominated for an Oscar again, I suspect. Or unless I get a job as a seat filler. https://t.co/MX03G8fTz8
@MJMcKean Winner turned up at the end of the press screening of Death Wish 3. He told all the press there that it was a masterpiece of cinema, and  if we thought otherwise we were wrong.  Also it’s Death Wish 3 not III because Cannon decided that people didn’t understand Roman Numerals.
@KurtBusiek @Downpuppy I was thinking Diana Wynne Jones.

'The lesson of the Holocaust is not that human beings are “somehow capable of resigning from their human obligations to one another,” she says, but that “they do so out of conscious moral choice.”' This is my Cousin Helen, 101 on Friday. She's remarkable. https://t.co/VmoNHpGa24
@PJeres @ancientlyric That makes me happy.
@Weinsteinlaw It's important.
@erikpellom @mark_phippen It was written in 1989.

@ancientlyric @MovieMadnessPDX Excellent choice.
@ancientlyric @MovieMadnessPDX It was final. I don't plan to do any more. I'll do speaking tours or reading tours, though.
@AmberRossArt It’s an old signature and an old drawing. Probably dates to the book release.
@FutureShockDoc @willbrooker @John_Divney_ @dredduniverse @JimmyNailz @RobDeb @2000AD I was a journalist who wanted to do comics back then.  And Alan’s friend.  I’ve faced burnout a few times since then, and put on the brakes.
hurrah! https://t.co/WNNPFnCxmf

@DishonoraryDoc @AmericanGodsSTZ @BryanFuller No, Starz announced that at one point, I think in the hope that if they announced it it would happen. But the reality of hours needed to finish Good Omens and the Ocean between me and LA and Toronto meant it was never possible.
Is THAT what people do? https://t.co/or99nVK2em

@DishonoraryDoc @AmericanGodsSTZ @BryanFuller That’s a weird question. I’m afraid I had less to do with Season 2 than I did with Season 1.   (I was making Good Omens in the UK. ) This season is Jesse Alexander’s vision.

@gordon861 @terryandrob @Discworld_com @PaulKidby Priced by Gollancz, the publisher.  They already have 2 different hardback editions in print, both for £14.99. For a well-bound, text-corrected, newly typeset, hardback book with colour and b&amp;w illustrations, £30 isn't a money-grab. And Definitive refers definitively to the text.
@brendageeker Not really. I wrote a children's book in May or June, because I was in a hotel and had evenings free, and I hadn't finished anything in forever. But mostly I've been writing emails about Good Omens.
It's a terrific article and background on Norse mythology (and on Norse Mythology). https://t.co/y5jv3PYfWK

@AphenoditeVenus @wiredfire @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo Thank you for talking. I appreciate it.
@AphenoditeVenus @wiredfire @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo That's very cool of you. I didn't have the option to stop Good Omens. I could've walked away, but someone would have made Good Omens, and I would not have been able to give my dead friend the thing I had promised him I would make: a show he could have watched and been proud of.
@AphenoditeVenus @wiredfire @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo It wasn't production quality. It was about it happening at all. I'd written it for Terry, as it was his last request that I bring it into existence. The BBC owned it &amp; didn't have the money to make it. They went out to find a partner. I made the show I promised Terry I'd make.
@ancientlyric That’s marvellous!
@JL_Prendergast @Moonbootica I didn't think we were having a spat, I was just trying to understand what your point was. I know you have one, but it is kind of eluding me. I'm really interested in understanding what it is.

@GrayStateFan Normally no.
@JL_Prendergast @Moonbootica But surely the joy of binging on a new show, is watching it all in one lump. I drift away when it comes weekly and lose interest: I don't have a life that works for Appointment Television.
@ben_rosenbaum @AlexWattsEsq I think she's a cthonic entity. But not any kind of deity. I liked Giorgia Grilli's book... (I think I even wrote an introduction to it.)
And you will get it, for free (with TV licence) on the BBC, 6 months after it drops on Prime. I think it's a pretty good deal, really. https://t.co/dGd649aRHc

@ermine_violin @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo We all get there eventually.
@JL_Prendergast @Moonbootica So you're suggesting it should go out day and date on the BBC (which would show it at an episode a week) at the same time we drop 6 episodes on Amazon Prime? Or we go out one ep a week on Prime too? I'm not clear on what you would be fixing.
This is heartwarming. Also, Sherlock Holmes fans are going to want to order these. https://t.co/8ho2N7yGXA

But Good Omens will all drop at the same time. Then it will go out on the BBC and then on international terrestrial channels, and reach a whole new audience of people who wouldn't watch Prime (or, I suspect, pirate). I think this release reaches a larger potential audience. https://t.co/zju7ERIKJT

@Tjrohr Weird. I'm seeing 7 hours left at https://t.co/1M0bjsvIED
@BBolander @theodoragoss That's my every day at writing.
@JL_Prendergast @Moonbootica But it will be released internationally when it's released. And then go out on free TV six months later.  And around the world on free TV six months after that. So you're saying we should drop it on a free channel internationally on the same day so no-one will ever pirate it?
That's good to know too! https://t.co/GlnKE43Dir
@wanderingpuck @ermine_violin @PrimeVideo The working conditions on Good Omens have been per union rules and so pretty good for everyone (except for the director and the showrunner, as we are working around the clock seven days a week to get the last episodes out the door so people can see it, but that's our choice).
Look! Another tiny Good Omens trailer. This one has me talking! https://t.co/nl0Kz6y7xB @GoodOmensPrime
@Headlong42 @JohnFinnemore @MitchBenn @TheUkes Sometimes. The UK right now.
ONLY ONE MORE DAY TO LISTEN. Acted by Diana Rigg, Derek Jacobi, Natalie Dormer, Colin Morgan and so many other good people. Adapted by @lucycatherine91. And directed by @allegramcilroy... https://t.co/shXSR08GKr
@Polgara01 @CunningSmi1e @GoodOmensPrime It is @GodsOnAmazon around the world, yes.
@JoanofDarkKnits This one will be ready for her when she is just the right age...
@mountain_who yes.
@cyanbeanie @p_bone Ah. I think we were talking at cross purposes. There we go. The magic of Twitter.
@wanderingpuck @ermine_violin @PrimeVideo It's absolutely not bullying. This is what Twitter is for. I understand that you are upset, and why you are upset. I hope you also understand that Good Omens as a TV series wouldn't exist without Amazon, but are happy that you can see it on the BBC.
@theodoragoss From your lips to the ears of all the little gods of words.
There is Coraline merchandise! Finally! Look!  https://t.co/hVQVYoLei9
@cyanbeanie @p_bone The tweet I quoted as I was replying to it, asked: Will there be any way of watching #GoodOmens without a Prime account?
@Wavyhill666 Ah, but how did they pronounce "wound" back then?
@FourPlaySQ I remember you! We have a whole album recorded from when I was young, don't we?
@AphenoditeVenus @wiredfire @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo That was what the BBC told us when they read my scripts. They didn't have enough money to make it. That was why they went out to get the money, and found Amazon. Why is it classist?
Possibly the most fun I've ever had writing a comic. https://t.co/2vFyYJ07Ax
@AphenoditeVenus @wiredfire @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo Without Amazon Prime you wouldn't have Good Omens. The BBC simply hasn't the money to make something of this scale.
When it's done, I plan to become a writer again. There aren't any upcoming things (except for one children's book). I have to start writing things again. I hope I remember how. https://t.co/RDGw6f035v
@nataliefisher They do. The person who told me this morning that the BBC had the money, but just lacked the guts to make the show was the most puzzling one for me, though.
Anyone from anywhere in the world can watch all 6 episodes on Amazon Prime Video when it drops later this spring. Then the BBC will show it 6 months later on UK terrestrial TV, and other international channels show it 6 months after that. Won't it reach the most people that way? https://t.co/hCLOtCa0Jw

@ant_ArT9 @wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo The BBC made it. And put their own money in.  So no lack of guts. But  Prime Video meant we had he money to make it properly.
You can wait six months and watch it on the BBC. Or wait another six months and watch it on regular tv around the world, if you have a local station that bought it from the BBC. https://t.co/8J4LTPZXdo
@wanderingpuck @PrimeVideo Well, Terry and my deal was with the BBC, who didn’t have the money to make it, so asked Prime Video to help, and wound up doing a deal of their own with Prime. So wait and you can watch on the BBC for free. (Having said that, they’ve proved the best tv making company I’ve met.)

US Audible subscribers! There's a "Daily Deal" going on for the audiobooks of Anansi Boys ($3.95) and Neverwhere ($4.95) until the 27th. @LennyHenry's performance of Anansi Boys is my favourite of all my Audiobooks!  Neverwhere is me reading.

@Hypersapien73 @charliebadger99 @Soc_of_Authors @Porter_Anderson @AuthorsGuild @englishpen @RSLiterature @Joannechocolat @PhilipPullman @MargaretAtwood @lindasgrant @PublishersAssoc @BAbooksellers Of course, in many cases, even a lifetime of books written isn't enough to look after writers when they get old. Most of them weren't lucky enough to write bestsellers when young that still sell. Which is why we have things like the Authors League Fund. https://t.co/3pqG8W47Zv

@Hypersapien73 @charliebadger99 @Soc_of_Authors @Porter_Anderson @AuthorsGuild @englishpen @RSLiterature @Joannechocolat @PhilipPullman @MargaretAtwood @lindasgrant @PublishersAssoc @BAbooksellers Some elderly writers no longer write what people want to read. Some no longer write as fast or as slowly. Some might wish to retire. Some might only have written one book that struck a chord with the public. I like that the books they wrote when younger look after them when old.
@EleraWoods An enormous amount. This is the longest I've ever done something else for since I was 22. I think from 1983 until June 2018 the longest I've gone without writing would have been a couple of weeks. Maybe.
@BookBoy1268 @brainpicker I think that's a shadow.
@julia_woehrlen I will get back to writing soon. Best advice is to set time aside each day and not to do anything else in it.

@lydia_thegrey I’m glad it helps.
@Bookworm604 @JohnCarmack It was in the days before Google and GPS. We did a lot of stupid things back then.
@Lloer There are definitely a lot of lines and bits in Good Omens that I wouldn’t have written now (or even 20 years ago) and that I like to think that Terry in his later years would have not written either.  (But only one that I actually excised on the recent correction edit.)
These are great! https://t.co/tAvQHFDMZd
@Ben_official That’s the plan.
@ProducerKallum I didn’t write it or direct it.  And most importantly, the big difference between that (or pretty much any of the others) is it didn’t feel like mine. Good Omens does.

It has a great many flaws. And no, I would never ever use it as a way to teach plotting. But the duck/water line is meant to be funny because it’s part of a series of ducks and water lines in the book. (“Ducks!” “What about ducks?” “They’re what water slides off.” Etc) https://t.co/oR7ILllIrZ

Very much so. On Neverwhere I was the writer, but the producer and the director and the BBC called the shots. On Good Omens, I’m the writer but I’m also the showrunner. It’s my show, ultimately. (Aided and abetted by @drmuig. Best to think of it as made by us.) https://t.co/pleIkJkIob
@Terryinindy @damiengwalter @dduane Yes. Soylent is in both versions of the story, the book and the film. It’s a single food source in both. It’s only made from people in the film.

She was amazing. We need to try and make this available again. I'll try and track down the rights... https://t.co/ahl0GJqqKX
@pieldestrella (This was a fun project done more or less as a hobby. That it became the bestselling book of its kind ever took everyone by surprise. Including the publishers, and me. It's a nice thing.)
@pieldestrella Yes. That was the point of my original tweet. That it was flattering...
@caelanhuntress It wore off long ago. But I've been doing this for a VERY long time. (I do it in airports, but only because I might stealth-sign them.)
It is available in Spanish. https://t.co/ByLDaM8bZb https://t.co/NKNlJYBkDq
@stepville Thank you! Mostly in a dark room staring at screens.
This, very gently, is my point. I own lots of books of Norse Mythology. If there had been others with a big hammer against a black background, ours wouldn't have had that cover. https://t.co/1itcr8zpzR
@BebeNeuwirth @MingVaseDynasty @SIRIUSXM I went looking for it a couple of days ago, and it seems to have vanished. I’ll talk to Harper Audio about getting it back...
@stepville Alas, no. In post production in London and Cardiff.
@MargaretAtwood Of course!
Work for a Million Graphic Novel by Hope Nicholson — Kickstarter. Looks fabulous and ⁦@MargaretAtwood⁩ wants it to happen, which is enough for me. https://t.co/WTiF2FrseC
And that was the one that hooked me as an adult. https://t.co/MJLr8Q561G
@keirshiels @budgie @lmtcrow It is now.
That was the one that hooked me as a boy. https://t.co/UsWtKPo09L
@theAthenticator Perhaps. It wasn’t obvious before Norse Mythology was a huge international bestseller. But I’m sure you are right.
@pieldestrella I didn’t expect that Norse Mythology would become a huge bestseller, so definitely didn’t expect that publishers would now repackage public domain retellings with similar covers, no.  Obviously I don’t think I own the title or cover hammers.
Best place to be. https://t.co/3Og3qz2vhy
@sleazythoughts It hasn’t bothered me yet, if it’s true.
There are several books out now called Norse Mythology, all with similar Hammers on the cover. It's slightly disconcerting: I'm not upset, just puzzled that people think that the best way to sell a book is to pretend to be a different one. #sincerestformofflattery https://t.co/nDGgJy9Onp
@lmorrisonTR @TheSimpsons @tbeaber @Zascquatch13 @marisaporto It's true.
@stepville That's wonderful!
@greenIanterns Right now all I’m working on is getting Good Omens over the finish line.
I’m just glad that Good Omens will stream everywhere at the same time when it finally drops on @PrimeVideo.  But the UK will also get it free first,  six months later. https://t.co/szJFqE6Q6i
@sh8kspeare @PSebae @itsKroovy Sorry people are giving you grief. I just like that the boy likes Coraline@
@SnefnyJenkins @guitardis @RealChrisKocher @bryanbroyles @JosephineActs @PrimeVideo Why let it send you notifications at all?
@MorganMagic @WestMagic I hope so! (It’s looking like I will be gone by the next gig though.)
@creativeDecoDev Thank you I think.

@mgranell Thank you!
@CourtneySiegle @WritersBlockWP It’s definitely my signature. I suspect it’s one that I signed for @wwnorton that quietly went out into the world.
@OurJane I don’t have that many friends who are millionaires, but I’ve made sure that all of my friends have seen it.
@criskeaney @guygavrielkay @straczynski Every writer’s writing schedule is the best for them.
Beautiful and filled with stories. https://t.co/tQDRTAmii8
@kevindoherty84 It will be out on the uk on prime. And then on bbc tv about 6 months later.
@vanessa_deeee That’s lovely to know. I’ve told them that I’m a) happy to do it again and b) would not be offended if they needed to cast someone who could actually act or was available.
I didn’t sign with Prime. The BBC did, because they couldn’t afford to make it alone. In the old days you waited sometimes years for American shows to appear in the UK. Think of it as being like the good old days. https://t.co/GZ4Ghwqt45
Grin. My greatest hits include, "Oh, all sorts of things. Well, fiction and nonfiction, yes. Adults and kids. Yes. Novels and other things." "I don't know. Probably not." "American Gods? Stardust? No? Er... if you have kids they might know Coraline. I wrote a Dr Who once..." https://t.co/9SRso1W2V1
@KimJames87 But only wait, and six months after the Prime screening, your licence fee buys you Good Omens on the BBC. Which isn't bad.
@LiamKavanagh17 @GennHutchison That one is even odder, because I'm not involved in Dr Who.
@ACSarahAC Yes please.
@PSebae @sh8kspeare @itsKroovy Tim Burton wrote the poem it was based on, and designed Jack and his dog. He was involved as a producer, after that, but the screenplay, characters, and design were Henry, Caroline Thomson and Henry's amazing team. Watch https://t.co/xMOX9JSe50

@JohnMcKL Day.
You can watch it on Prime Video. Which is in Australia too. https://t.co/QBLCjlE8U9
Good Omens will go out on @PrimeVideo first. Then, around 6 months later, it will go out on the BBC, an episode at a time. https://t.co/79qKEVP6VL
Whichever one we are working on that day. We’ve been doing stuff on Episode 5 this week, so it’s currently my favourite. From Sunday I will remember once again how much I love Episode 6. (It has Andy Hamilton as Hell’s Usher in it, for a start.) https://t.co/s1dHi65SDc
You might as well read the book first, because there is time before the show comes out. There are also Easter Eggs in the show for people who have read the book. https://t.co/P4r8e67chq
Thank you! https://t.co/Al8JHhj2MK
I figure it’s the price I pay for making Good Omens. Just as explaining to people that you can listen to @BBCiPlayerRadio anywhere in the whole world is the price I pay for being on the BBC. https://t.co/QMQcAC2oDn
Me too. Dear lordie, me too. https://t.co/TbS2lyuMqy
No, it will be on @PrimeVideo everywhere. 242 territories. https://t.co/1hbAWd0wwR
Point taken. https://t.co/uOiIXjxpqL
No, Prime Video in the UK first. Then BBC about 6 months later. https://t.co/YhiSY7Xlge

It did. But post-production hasn’t. https://t.co/odRWA4rcQS
On @GoodOmensPrime it will be all the episodes at one time. On the BBC  it will be one a week. https://t.co/JRAKbWNuxB

@KurtBusiek @JeremyForbing @DrewMelbourne That would work. (What I was asked to do was just bring them back and fit them in.  So you’d have to bring the Kirby. )
@Felgraf_Physics @BenIrvine14 No, he wrote and asked me to do it when he was still alive. His posthumous letter was about other things.
@Dangermook40 @LindaWonder @MoonaWagner This one was written by me, and showrun by me, and is being made by me and @drmuig, who is as determined as I am to make something that's the TV draft of Good Omens, that Terry would have loved.
@hiddeninabook I'm pretty sure that @PrimeVideo  is in Norway. Let me know if it isn't.
Never. It will be on Prime Video and then on the BBC. https://t.co/0vWIdCFntF

I'm sorry, if you had a point, I still don't know what it was. Good luck in the future, though.
@Kadys13 @MagsVisaggs I'm so glad.
@NimueSnow @CarrCole @ManMadeMoon I think she just read the tweet too quickly and got the wrong end of the stick.
@ribblefizz @RachelA_Adler @almostconverge @TerryPratchett @GoodOmensPrime @nytimes Obviously not. But I don't think in the evidence of the review, Mr Queenan felt it was the kind of book you actually have to read all the way through to write about.
@ChrisEGallop @adders I've missed the intransigence and only seen the UK political incompetence.

The best thing about the I-Hate-This-Book-and-British-People-Aren’t-Funny Joe Queenan review was that we put “A direct descendant of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. @nytimes” on the paperback book cover, and sold shedloads of extra copies. https://t.co/je3FC0QUpy

This is sort of my point. I don't KNOW that the contracts were intentionally lost. But in each case it benefited the people involved enormously that they didn't have the contracts, and thus couldn't honour them, and were certain that they didn't exist. Until we found them. https://t.co/ZmClARfEjg

@Noir_L_amour Yes. None of them were Laurel and Hardy. None of them were French and Saunders. They did different things.
@svndxnce For my signature, talk to @GoldenNotebook1. When I'm in the area I keep them topped up with signed books.

@svndxnce It can work but often the books never make it there or back. It's safer, if you see we are doing a signing somewhere, to call the bookseller and say "I'd like a copy of (book you don't have) dedicated to Distant Screaming." We sign it. They send you the book.
@moravianqueen I understand. But are you sure that the Southern pronunciation of Cauliflower is the same as the   Generic Midwestern - say, Minnesotan - pronunciation of the word?

@dandelionmama @BeanPhilosopher @j_cordeiro I'm so glad. The world is small and there are so many good people in it.
@IrritableOldMan I don't think so. I mean, I won all the legal cases, and he paid up and settled, and I donated my share of the money to charity. I think he could saved both of us money and time if he'd just stuck to his original agreements, but there you go.
@WalterSimonson We did it, Walt! Thank you!
@BackstageRider All good.
@MonicaLewinsky @BeanPhilosopher @LidlUS Thank you for helping, Monica!
Say Hello! https://t.co/ujZNtI4pi1
@monicabyrne13 I didn't even know this was a thing.
@strawn_na No, he wasn't seeking murderous vengeance on the people he was locked up with.  He was talking about them all being in prison together, and not being scared by them or intimidated. You should reread it.
@BeanPhilosopher @LidlUS Well done, Bean!
@PartyFreckle Happy Birthday!
Not really. I get occasional "Ah... you, er... have you... there's a writer who you... er...." and then I go "Yes, I'm him." If I'm standing next to @amandapalmer then it's different and people know I'm me. https://t.co/fhIKPbC0Zz
@moravianqueen Well, if you are in the UK or Australia, it IS collie-flower. And if you are in much of the US, it's more CAHL-aflower: https://t.co/2UiUGKdvZb
@sandman935 @StephenKing Not at all. The difference was people who knew who he was knowing what he looked like, and the "Do you know me?" of people who didn't really know who he was knowing what he looked like.
@chrononaught @StephenKing I'm so glad.
@johnrsmithjnr @BeanPhilosopher He made it!
@j_cordeiro @BeanPhilosopher You are so welcome. It's good to see Twitter making life better for people, and educating people as well. Good luck!
@theagilmore So excited to hear the music!!
@Sigismundi Not yet.
It does. https://t.co/jVMwHfllzq
I was hoping to screenshot the 72,000, but it went too quickly. THANK YOU to everyone who helped get @BeanPhilosopher his Peanut Butter. (His father's a furloughed worker too, so I am sure that every extra jar of Peanut Butter in their life will be appreciated.) https://t.co/t3F6gkSMpp
I gave up in 2008 when I won the Newbery Medal, and started appearing on TV more. But between random beards and being a writer, I still feel pretty anonymous. https://t.co/pRx78BjcdN

Nearly there. One last push and we can get it over the line. Remember, RT his original post. https://t.co/jMGEddb1gc
Yes, @StephenKing told me something very similar when we met in 1992. It was a major reason why I said no to being on David Letterman and suchlike TV through the 1990s. https://t.co/44pP53bR4z
@dandelionmama You're so welcome. I gave it another push last night my time and another this morning. Some excellent people who follow me pushed it themselves. We're nearly there.
@vtraddict You have!
I've never had any difficulty going to the supermarket. Or wandering around London, sitting in corners drinking tea. Nobody much seems to notice. https://t.co/hsGtzMAmKc
@debcha That's definitely normal, isn't it?
@JoanofDarkKnits Yes. Tea is good. Tea helps.
@bstiteler @birdchick Can this be true? First @hayleycampbell and now @birdchick ?
@hayleycampbell Oh. Well.   I suppose that must be nice for everyone else.
@stevieboatleft Oh good.
@hayleycampbell You mean that when you talk to normal people you DON'T look at them nervously as if they might explode, and then talk loudly and clearly to them as if you are talking to an absent-minded small child. You don't do that to everyone?
@hayleycampbell Do you treat them better or worse? Or is it just that you listen in case I actually say something sensible?
@EmpSpaceRabbit a) 17 b) some time this spring c) yes, but not always
@hayleycampbell How do you treat normal people in conversations, Hayley?
Mostly (as far as I can tell) I get treated a lot like a normal person in conversations. https://t.co/JnTxPInz4h
Do I get tired of having readers? No. It's a good thing for a living author to have readers. Do I wish there was a "death of the author" moment? Yes, if it's a https://t.co/7ZmDT6b3Ug thing. No, if it involves my heart stopping and then getting buried. https://t.co/vHTAO4QBRK

Not yet. People need to RT his original tweet. Not “quote tweet” it... https://t.co/zb08GjOThn
It’s just a way.  Regional pronunciations aren’t right or wrong. They just are. https://t.co/Uq0d7MyfkO
@Erinescence @TexasLibrary @Lauchlin It’s a long G. Nighting-ale is not nighting-gale.
@Erinescence @Lauchlin Exactly
Odd trivia I’ve only noticed on Good Omens. Americans and Brits pronounce “Nightingale” differently. Brits pronounce it “Nighting-gale” and Americans pronounce it “night-in-gale”.

He's already got 5000 RTs today, and is even closer to possibly getting a lifetime's supply of Peanut Butter.* But you have to RT his original tweet, not this one.  *A good thing, if you are wondering, see the thread in the original tweet. https://t.co/jMGEddb1gc

@AuthorSDMiller It was good -- she had sold a book of mine, representing my publisher, and we met for lunch and I told her my plans for the future, and she said she wanted to represent me. That was  over 30 years ago. But I'd already had 3 or 4 books published by then, without an agent.

Many years ago, I sent a white-faced silent clown to a friend's wedding. He turned up, sat in the back during the service, and when my friend said "Who ARE you? Who SENT you? Did NEIL have anything to do with this?" he said nothing. It was an excellent wedding present. https://t.co/phZNjV5GUl

No, it was lunchtime. But you weren't allowed to be seen eating in school uniform outside of the school. And I was seen in the graveyard at the top of Heathfield Road. And there were chips, from what is now the Castella Fish Bar, South Croydon, being eaten in the graveyard. https://t.co/qBVL6JmZVS

2019 is ALREADY better than 2018. It has a Penguin named Coraline in it. https://t.co/KBXOYMdT3X
@shabnomnom @amandapalmer Sending love to you and Alex!
@pinfallbookone That's really sweet. C.S. Lewis invited readers who wanted to know what happened to Susan to write it themselves: I'm glad we both have.
@moonchild_marie If I can the names will do lots of things. But either characters turn up with them (easy) or they don't and I have to name them (hard).
I love you @amandapalmer. Happy first-not-together anniversary.  I hope it’s our last not-together one. https://t.co/SFI9uA46us
Weird. On the Instagram post it’s @ayeletw and Michael Chabon. But that has transmuted into two Ayelets as it reposted. https://t.co/oS0p5xnJL9
It was the 2nd of January 2011, and @ayeletw and @ayeletw gave up their house and day to hosting a wedding so informal and unexpected that most of the guests thought they were just coming… https://t.co/z7vmgmKRgn
@slepkane @karenpberger @1PeterMilligan @jamiedelano @davegibbons90 @sinKEVitch @wossy @2000AD You had me at @JohnFinnemore.
@xinekite @Firannion @amandapalmer According to https://t.co/XJIQme0PQz your parents were buying a perfectly average-priced house (median) in 1973.
@kimrhodes4real It is! It is!
Excellent. (It's a terrific book.) https://t.co/K5sfzqIDET
@Helena_Basket I'm glad I can help.
You are welcome! https://t.co/0b7oLujeUh
@dominic_glasgow @BBCRadio4 I think so yes!
@janenash_au Yes...
@vix_lamb @Baddiel Of course!
@vix_lamb @Baddiel He really wasn't. He did cartoons when young that he regretted but his later life work was very much anti racism.  https://t.co/H7qznt4piQ
@stockenjigsaw @nyuniversity I'm glad. Except about the being detained.
@JennQuercus @Baddiel I'm not female. I'm definitely Jewish. I'd put good money on @Baddiel not being female and also being Jewish too.
True. https://t.co/QTZCrKtJkK
@jackthorne @Coyoteguy Now that's a blurb.
@fichefindr I don't know about current fantasy, but I know that I am a product of both of them.
@KellyDMcC There are books like that. And authors, too.
Huge influence. My copy of Lonesome October was a gift from Roger in 1993 at the Twin cities World Fantasy Convention. https://t.co/65J5SgUOEf
@jackthorne Permission granted, of course!
@AlexJHolt @Baddiel That's odd -- https://t.co/GJOsCBRHrI doesn't talk about anything other than the fiction, and talks about that changing and softening as he got older.
@JupiterSpurlock @equerystrian Use a computer attached to the Internet, or a smartphone.
@AlexJHolt @Baddiel How was Howard appalling? His suicide is tragic, but I've not read anything about his appallingness.
@jackthorne Excellent. (Long ago, in a 2000AD story, I tried naming a character CLINT FLICKER. The editor saw the potential problems and it did not happen.)
@whinney_holly I hope you enjoy it.
@mamabearwriter It's good with me!
@AaronCarine @Baddiel There's a short story called The Mark of the Beast which is bad in so many ways. And he wrote some beautiful, wise stories too.
@amoirh Good, isn’t it?
@Baddiel True. I love Chesterton and Kipling, and learned from both of them, and both of them wrote things that make me cringe and sigh. (It's even worse with Anonymous. Anonymous could have done anything. We don't know...)
@stockenjigsaw @nyuniversity Not this year. I will be making a TV show in London still.
@johnreppion I had *more* respect for you for what you said. Even more respect, I should say.
@TheRealStupid Yes. Everywhere. It’s @GoodOmensPrime
@pinfallbookone Thank you so much! I appreciate it and much more importantly, they will appreciate it.
@pinfallbookone And to you!
@malphunkson @mhrabosky Or The Merchant of Venice.
@pinfallbookone No, the lion and the witch isn't about being adult. But that's definitely one way to approach it.   You would, however, need to assume the lion isn't Jesus. The Mary Poppins sequence might help.
@jackthorne And you do it so very well, Jack. I hope we can get together in the New year.
@pinfallbookone I think you are misunderstanding what I wrote. And you might want to go back and re-read The Problem With Susan, while assuming that it isn't about hating anyone. Look at Greta's dream, and Professor Hastings' life, and how they relate to a set of 7 children's books.
@caitylew I am sure that you will.
@MeasurelessLiar Thank you! I really like knowing you. Hope that 2019 treats you kindly.
@okelay Could it be the January tale in the Calendar of Tales?
@MrBitterwitter I think so.
@5AMM7 I think you're thinking of Neil Simon.
For those of you wondering: a) where the complete set of my New Year's Wishes can be found, b) What I've been making this year c) What's happening on the Good Omens TV series and d-z) why I am alone &amp; tweeting on New Year's Eve: https://t.co/Zm7OAVTuW0
@nimeshab Thank you!
Fascinating! https://t.co/MGg2alkW7o
@B1Jhonneh Probably not.
@5AMM7 That was Neil Armstrong.
@pottertardis Thank you!
That Was The 2018 That Was https://t.co/tEw9pCPDjZ WARNING: CONTAINS ME https://t.co/r1EYafxzNB
I’d love to do this. https://t.co/p1HcGcVl2E
It really is. @drmuig and I are working to make a show that Terry Pratchett would have been proud of. https://t.co/URN4dgHq0w
@nkjemisin In this case, it's not America's fault. Before  1914 every American town and village had its "spreading chestnut tree".
@Vnend Try the new link.
Let's hope it works this time. A blog. Filled with news and wishes.  That Was The 2018 That Was  https://t.co/tVxFNEGANP
This is glorious! https://t.co/hR2ihkdOpH
@mariafranceline @Michael_Butz In the times of darkness, do not keep things to yourself. Now is when people need hope the most.
@pinfallbookone I do, and I appreciate it.
@pinfallbookone You are so welcome. And, as I said, you may enjoy https://t.co/1TnkhMePFv -- it was delivered to the Mythopoeic Society.
@pinfallbookone I would never describe any story as "just a story". They have power, as you say.  But I don't believe that seven children's books are holy allegory. This talk I gave to the Mythopoeic society may help: https://t.co/1TnkhMePFv
@pinfallbookone That's really sad, but it's your call. For whatever it's worth, I don't believe a fictional lion in children's books is actually Jesus. I don't believe Snoopy is Jesus either. (And I'm afraid Charles Schulz in his later years described himself as a secular humanist.)
Good company to be in. https://t.co/iap7plKHgH
@pinfallbookone Got it. So you think that Schulz would only have seen the Narnia books as Christian allegories, and not also as stories? That seems to go against what Schulz himself said about Peanuts. (And remember Short's Gospel of Peanuts, in which he states Snoopy represents Christ?)

@pinfallbookone Got it. So (sorry to keep going on this, I'm still trying to understand) do you also see Linus as Jesus? Or are you saying that Aslan=Jesus, so had Schulz lived to read and understood the Susan story as you did he would have worried that I'd do the same to the Peanuts characters?
It was there in the original... https://t.co/Ui3gQnvFct https://t.co/FcPCWPCvsa
@pinfallbookone I thought Aslan was a lion in a children's story. It's puzzling for me to see people actually reading him as Jesus, and regarding that sequence as blasphemous. (Cunnilingus, btw. Fellatio is different.) I'd never known that Schulz was a Narnia fan, though. Is there an interview?
@deborah_gay I wish I were there. I miss Skye.
@Sherlock_B_ Yes, it's fine for a 12 year old.
@pinfallbookone As I said in the introduction, the point of the story was to write something that made people feel as uncomfortable as Lewis's treatment of Susan had made me feel, while also talking about the relationship between adults and children's fiction. It sounds like it worked.
@pinfallbookone Or are you saying that, as someone who has written that story, I'm no longer permitted to love Lewis or Schulz? And why Schulz? Take a deep breath and try and explain.
@pinfallbookone Still not getting your point. Is there anything in the story you see as Anti Christian or Anti Lewis? Or Anti Schulz? Yes, there's definitely some sex alluded to in there, but as Lewis suggested to fans who wrote to him, one should make up one's own future for Susan.
Lots of people are asking whether various New Year's wishes attributed to me are actually mine. Here's a 2014 blog post with all of the important ones I've written in the last 18 years together: https://t.co/Ui3gQnvFct
@pinfallbookone Not sure that I understand your point?
You are welcome. https://t.co/YJUWKMmODs
@nkjemisin The test is are they nice to eat, sweet and nutlike when raw? Or have the sugars all become starch, and are they soft, chewy or too hard and either way a bit tasteless? Good chestnuts are fabulous raw and good cooked. (UK fresh chestnuts are terrific but they don't get exported.)
@_rohoho Not that I know of.  It’s probably “fair use” though.  And they may well have asked my agents or publishers.
These days, it’s just nice to be attributed. https://t.co/MMtZxAqqoC
@nkjemisin Because of Chinese chestnut blight in the US, native trees were all dead &amp; gone by the 1930s. But people remembered and sang songs. These days chestnuts in the US come in from normally Italy, not fresh, and are dried out, old and sad. (Roast fresh chestnuts are pretty good. )
@calamityjonez There’s at least one YouTube video of Amsterdam.
@MainMor Anything by E Cobham Brewer.
I always loved Charles Schulz. Which makes being quoted on a Schulz calendar a real honour. https://t.co/r5eyp28zT3
@DanaSchwartzzz oh, but Paddington used its News Reel well...

@SDuPreeBemis It’s more of a tote bag than a purse. But yes! I do!
@JackTLadd Done.
@DRjohnsonkelly Yes, and Stardust.
@alexandreL I think so.
@DRjohnsonkelly Ask the library if they can order it. That's a 10 book set.
@TheOrlandoJones You are the coolest.
Well, that made my morning. https://t.co/xTjTJtPlHf
@DrCOughton All good. RTed.
