@El_FutbolJunkie no, not yet- zac steffen and guzan still ahead of him imo. steffen better all around keeper
@kjchanusmnt 100%. it‚Äôs progressive, flexible system, encourages attacking play/possession, and they‚Äôve won 2 in a row. early days, but positive
@mclubbes retirement.... ugh.
@MikeErtel10 i‚Äôm a fan of style of play- flexible system, encourages attacking play, possession based - and fun. now, can they do that against top teams

great win this morning @rcd_mallorca!!! 3 puntos!!! https://t.co/yVpmLDx5o8
@RCD_Mallorca grande!!!!! 3 puntos
@LeeDixon2 i don‚Äôt disagree mate, but do all players treat it as such? im not highlighting it as a revolutionary concept, but instead  to show a veteran (that receives unrelenting criticism) as the only one doing extra work that wasn‚Äôt required... an example of why he has 143 caps
@futboltx prove it
@TheRallyMullet @AlexiLalas Money talks. Unfortunately, local TV deals are hard to secure and are often at the expense of the club. It kills distribution and costs the consumer, not ideal for growing the game - but it‚Äôs a business at the end of the day.
@QueerSporting @AlexiLalas I can see a world with: Adams as the RB/CM or in #10/8 position, Bradley as #6, McKennie as one of #10‚Äôs, Pulisic as one of #10‚Äôs or Wide players // A few younger players will have something to say also.
@JordanDoenges @AlexiLalas I believe the issues arises from Chicago owning his player rights and because Nashville are technically an MLS club now. dicey.
@nicholaslmartin @AlexiLalas He‚Äôs an allbirds kind of guy now. Comfort over speed.
@legit_longhorn @ussoccer_mnt Boyband in the making.
@AlfredoPolar @AlexiLalas It‚Äôs January camp, I‚Äôm encouraged yet not getting carried away.
@Dudesbee @AlexiLalas Buttery.
@Sole_Man96 @AlexiLalas You tell me?
@Flyguy14 *the team‚Äôs failure. Soccer is a team sport. And what‚Äôs not impressive? The motivation to go back out and do extra running that‚Äôs not required? Ok.
@AlexiLalas The buttery aroma is consuming the cabin.
@nicholaslmartin @AlexiLalas He took the solo seat across the isle, although he does have a serious wingspan.
@AlexLombardi_22 @AlexiLalas I did receive an email invitation from a USMNT fan and winemaker during the game. I hope to take him up on the offer in March
@AlfredoPolar @AlexiLalas Are you deducting a goal vs Panama?
@kjksccr @AlexiLalas I asked him the same thing. It‚Äôs on brand.
@mario_herrera @MattDoyle76 Huh? 143 caps.. your comment insinuates he hasn‚Äôt put any work in before?
@AlexiLalas Seeing as we‚Äôre seat mates, you want to tag team this Q&amp;A? #AskAlexiAskStu?
@AlexiLalas Drink of choice?
@Flyguy14 You‚Äôre missing the point my friend‚Ä¶ Berhalter didn‚Äôt make anyone run sprints.. he ran sprints by himself. Keep up.
@mattdanaher standard practice for a pro? according to who? perhaps your expectations don‚Äôt match reality, but not every player goes the extra mile. who else is out there?
not to mention i still feel he‚Äôs the best #6 in the pool. imo, it‚Äôs his spot until someone beats him out- that was evident against panama. the video is further proof he won‚Äôt be going down without a fight.
for those with a negative response and/or an unwavering disdain towards MB... here‚Äôs a 31 year old guy with 143 caps for national team, who didn‚Äôt play today and comes out by himself 30 mins post match to get fitness work in. i‚Äôll take a guy like that on my team all day long.
@jared_bailey90 it‚Äôs more about his mentality... but sure, pick whatever narrative you want
michael bradley back out on field doing fitness work by himself in the rain with fitness coach. he‚Äôs got plenty left in the tank https://t.co/YTQOT0CBXr

@bayer04_en 1-2 Bayern. Bailey to score for B04
@CGBish White Hart Lane was an undercover gem. Close quarters, fans on top of the pitch, and holds a special place for me because it‚Äôs where I made my debut.
@Nizar61 In a tweet? That seems impossible to achieve properly. Culture seems to be rotten and it‚Äôs a tough task for Sarri. Ownership need to back him, but we all know how that goes...
@mthead141 @Chrisawesome63 Surprised by his tactical smarts and ability to adjust to a new system and position so quickly.
@FootballOnside hey football onside, appreciate you. Favorite goal.. Bolton vs Blackburn 89th minute winner‚Ä¶ blacked out.
@Brett94235716 Yes, undoubtedly. His work ethic, speed, tactical awareness and overall quality - he‚Äôll do well.
@MaxistheBaum #9 position has been a weird one for SKC for a number of years now- feels like the only missing piece. Their style of play needs a player with good hold-up play and mobility to get in the box. Wide players are the focal point
@Jlpaz87 That depends on the facts of how the deal fell through, I‚Äôve read multiple reports now. No doubt he‚Äôll be unsettled, so it‚Äôs up to DC to pony up the big bucks now to settle him and motivate him
@johno_mk Barca barca barca. Man, I‚Äôd love to just sit in that midfield and give it to Messi every time with 1 or two touches
mihailovic has cornered the market. there‚Äôs a new kid in town‚Ä¶ that and @karalynwest might throw me out of the house. https://t.co/8y4yxSIrWV

@MichaelShale Most / Sunday roasts - Least / Weather.
@EricCrocker20 I hope eventually that‚Äôs the case- or MLS1 / MLS2 - to create pressure and raise the stakes. Lower leagues are an important part of the soccer landscape in our country
@HampB273 @ClemsonFB Love it‚Ä¶ try to catch every national game
@LBIROB It‚Äôs not an uncommon system and you always expect teams will scout you and prepare for your style. It‚Äôs all about how the team can counter-press in transition and be in good positions if they lose the ball. I like the system and have faith in it.
@Andrew_Nieland World Cup appearance and goal vs Blackburn for Bolton.. a memory I‚Äôll never forget.
@sbayds10 Here and there when we cross paths. Hoping he can stay healthy, lovely and talented lad
@SunTzuSoccer Parts of it.
@johno_mk Nope- would‚Äôve had a tough decision in 2011 had I not gotten the major injury - but Dynamo and Bolton two clubs I am very proud to have loved and represented.
@JohnPMotta @SouthwestAir I‚Äôm a loyal Delta guy, the tire change has crushed my dreams.

@13_dyerman Zidane and Beckham
@GoatHCW nopeeeeee
@jenkifoci Nikolic first season wonder.. I like the upside on Salloi if he can be more consistent. Kid‚Äôs got something about him
@bayonetbrant A guy I‚Äôve been going to bat for over the last few months - Michael Bradley. Oft maligned by fans, I think he‚Äôs a very smart and still very important piece of this team over next few years.
@waltonandy They‚Äôve not really given Parky any help have they? Hoping big Wheatz rallies the lads and they can gain some momentum down the stretch. COYW
@jorge831 Hope you prove me wrong. I love Austin
@EMC1803 Going with the Rams!!! I‚Äôve adopted them as my LA team and jumped on the bandwagon. Down goes Brady
@Chrisawesome63 Mihailovic and Lima been two stand-outs for me, hoping they keep their place for tomorrow
@mattneuhausen Anyone‚Ä¶ Me, Pel√©, Messi, Pique, Zidane
@mattneuhausen Players I‚Äôve played with or just anyone?
@rrounsley @dcunited Depends what frame of mind Acosta is in this season and how the defense plays. Attacking wise very strong and lot‚Äôs of creative players. Have to regain the momentum from last season quickly..
@sepo_efc I can see it, but not for some time. I‚Äôd see them being played in Central America first
@kalvinpatel Style of play, camaraderie, well worked goals with young and hungry players. Looking forward to seeing how they build from that.
@pmturcotte Ha. TV is an ever changing landscape and I‚Äôll reserve judgement until I see how it‚Äôs marketed and distributed. As of now, doesn‚Äôt look like a great deal-but probably better than any others offered from a financial perspective.
@ExtremeSkier666 No, but my hips don‚Äôt lie.
@tommymorgan25 Gerard in his prime, I loved every second.
@CoryBraddock Want to be my agent???
@Kenbele0722 As of now I‚Äôm a yes, I‚Äôd like to see how they navigate these next two months. No doubt he‚Äôs brought passion, energy and pride back to the club- can build around that if results follow
@_j898s @ussoccer_mnt Best players under the right circumstances. Not expecting Pulisic, etc, to play
@kSelvig Gold Cup. I want the senior team to start producing results and looking forward to seeing this younger group under pressure.

@1Sambo3 At Avaya it‚Äôs all one height correct? But no, not $100 for a January camp match.
@Wheevers101 I hope to this year (and hope we stay in championship)
@bayer04_en Do you really want to hear it?
@elsportsdude Damn, good question. Give me a second‚Ä¶. hmm‚Ä¶ I felt big time love for Americans in South Korea and China when I was there with U20 and Olympics. Pretty awesome. Animosity.. if you‚Äôre talking team and fans.. Mexico for sure. That game is wild.

@CBurleyESPN if a player has had injuries, lack of form, transfer interest and contract issues behind the scenes.... sancho / team playing well- of course that‚Äôs going to contribute to him not playing as much in the league.
@CBurleyESPN i don‚Äôt disagree and said his performances haven‚Äôt been great. you can‚Äôt argue that won‚Äôt have contributed, no?
@_williamrussell @brfootball @cpulisic_10 get @GeoffCameron in there also will  ya? ü§£ü§£ü§£
also, with reports that the deal was initially looked at in autumn, it gives context as to why he‚Äôs been in and out of the line-up at bvb. while it hasn‚Äôt been his best year performance wise, guys like sancho have thrived with their opportunities. 6 months to win the bundesliga!
his ability off the dribble 1 vs 1, speed, smarts and athleticism will all be valuable tools in the premier league for chelsea. he has a coach that favors attacking soccer and a team loaded with talent. i hope he gets the right opportunities and performs. we‚Äôll be watching!
huge and historic news today with christian pulisic transfer to @chelseafc. record $73 million fee for an american and one of the world‚Äôs most exciting young talents.
@brfootball @cpulisic_10 damn, trolled pretty hard
@MichaelBuckelew yeah, who‚Äôd want to see that? terrible
@The_Axelander i know... she forgot who won initially and then saved it with texas a sentence later
@derek3wl just the right weight

@KaralynWest @rosebowlgame now if we could just cut out the ‚Äúclemson sucks‚Äù training- i‚Äôd be down to like this.

@NTmoney welcome to the dark side! happy new year üëçüëç thanks!
@rossor You know, I thought about totaling that up today.. I have 170k MQM‚Äôs on Delta this year‚Ä¶ lol‚Ä¶ that should tell you the story.
@_michaelbutera I think he‚Äôd suit Liverpool style of play well, but no chance anyone breaking into that front 3 currently. I like the idea of Chelsea.
@Chrisawesome63 Soto promoted to first team and Hannover in a bad spot/need a spark, could be soon.
@scram171 @AlexiLalas I was doing this before @AlexiLalas knew what the internet was. We‚Äôre currently locked in an IP lawsuit.
@rossor @GrandArmyGR I‚Äôd love to get back there soon, how was last season?
@ScottBrickman23 That‚Äôs a loaded question.. I‚Äôm not sure if I am able to respond in short form. I‚Äôm  part of a newly formed Youth Soccer Task Force with Us Soccer and in charge of member growth / development to tackle the issues in that landscape. Hopefully we can find some of these solutions
There will be plenty more in 2019. Adams (RB Leipzig), Mendez (Freiburg), Reyna to BVB (supposedly), Sargent playing at Werder, Soto (Hannover) https://t.co/km78lNSlbh
@Neilieboy28 I didn‚Äôt but it sounded like a great day for the gers‚Ä¶ how is Stevie G doing there? Polster a very solid MF/DF, can play both positions well - good passer, covers ground well, intelligent.
@SalvatoreBirard Nobody compares to Connery.
@BrianButcher19 Initially surprised.. curious to see at what number salary wise. If it‚Äôs in the 200k range, I think it‚Äôs a savvy and low risk signing with big upside if he performs Well in LWB position
@TravisLuscombe You the man. Happy NYE and many happy returns
@MicDubTV I think if given the right opportunities in one of the wide positions under Sarri- his style suits that very well. He‚Äôs good on the dribble and good 1 vs 1 to create chances and goals.
@kaustinsoccer pr@stuholden.com
@CoreyJTuttle Incredible how well that move has worked out‚Ä¶ Van Dijk has exceeded all expectations.. high ones at that. He‚Äôs been the perfect piece to the puzzle and benefits from the team / coach / project at Liverpool currently. They need to win it.
@AmericanHoolis His every move will be scrutinized and analyzed‚Ä¶ nature of the job and the current climate. People want to see something they can see promise in from the beginning. It will take time and Jan camp group not his A group by long shot
@WLeisey Not sure yet.. first time and enjoyed the experience in the Camp Nou. I think Tottenham knock Dortmund out
@jackfritzfans Oh man‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll go with Reyna, but both exciting talents. Excited to see their progress in Europe - great moves for their development.
@borjaleonsolans I won‚Äôt- would love to see it as a Copa America including USA/Mex/Canada etc. Thought Centenario was an amazing tournament.
@kaustinsoccer Haven‚Äôt we been trying this dance for a while now? Can you email me? ha. Sorry!!
@MDM_LFC liverpool. Love you too.
@JoeMazakes Yes, absolutely. If Almiron goes, I like the addition of Martinez and still adding some good role players. Interested how De Boer does / sets the team up &amp; relates with latino contingent. Tata had a great way with Almiron, Martinez, etc.
@jamesinho4 I‚Äôd like to think so‚Ä¶ but never really know. We had such a great group and team the 10/11 season - think we could‚Äôve finished top 8 that year.
@Kemper525 That‚Äôs actually a Rapunzel wig in the Elsa shot‚Ä¶ cross princessing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all the rage. Need to add the dress to my collection.
@cade_garcia Need to start by winning gold cup in 2019 by which time I‚Äôll have a more realistic expectation. I know the team will be much better organized and you‚Äôll see a distinct style for USMNT this cycle.
flying high in the sky one last time in 2018.. capping a personal record travel year. what‚Äôs on your mind? fire away.

@Brandon51296650 @honigstein he‚Äôll get a percentage of the transfer fee... i think it‚Äôs 5% if i remember correctly... plus a big bumper contract with probably 4-5 years guaranteed.

town... he said he‚Äôd scheduled his wife an apt around the time of the match so he could drop her off and still catch the game. game finished and we went our separate ways. we lost a good one today, but it‚Äôs safe to say his legacy will live on forever.
i will never forget watching a UCL match in a santa monica bar on a random tuesday... sigi walked in, sat to my left, ordered food and was fixated on the game. we chatted throughout, never once taking our eyes off the game. i remember asking him what he was doing on this side of
Sigi Schmid.... on the field, a visionary and pioneer &amp; his influence on the sport in the usa will be felt for many years to come. off the field, a gentleman and soccer savant... you‚Äôll struggle to find many that loved it more.

another @mls season in the books - time for a HUGE thanks to our incredible crew and staff behind the scenes at @foxsoccer. too many to list, but their hard work is why IMO we continually produce good soccer tv- including the big show last night.
i‚Äôve had the honor to call three major finals with @johnstrong this year (ucl, world cup, mls) and the atmosphere last night was up there with some of the best i‚Äôve experienced as a broadcaster and player.
an incredible showcase for @mls last night. atlanta utd has become the new gold standard for the league, while portland continue to embody the passionate soccer culture in the NW. as someone that played in the 8 league years ago, it‚Äôs growth is undeniable and is amazing to see.

@Chrisawesome63 sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do.
@JHill_MileHigh shhh, this is a period of grieving for me. I‚Äôm not ready to talk about it yet, in fact i‚Äôm still being held captive inside the school. send help
update: I survived- after my book reading fell flat, an impromptu game of soccer broke out. also, I nut megged 3 children and didn‚Äôt feel bad about it.
@rachelbonnetta I‚Äôve been watching it on repeat.

today i‚Äôm doing a presentation for my daughters pre school class and I‚Äôm absolutely terrified. what happens if i mess it up? will my 2 yr old daughter‚Äôs school life be ruined forever? if they don‚Äôt like me, i‚Äôm not sure my confidence will recover. send help.

well they answered that question impressively. hell of a response after going down twice, sancho much better 2nd half and reus / witsel immense throughout. title race well and truly on.
@_SoccerThoughts @mediocentroEN With what results? Doesn‚Äôt matter on individual performance if not producing as a collective
@mediocentroEN He started them both mid week vs Atletico in UCL. Pulisic not been sharpest since coming back from injury, makes sense to go with Sancho and Bruun Larson- team has been better with that consistency.
Dortmund going to Dortmund I guess... Bayern continually have their number, no matter the situation. Is this a new @BVB under Favre? We‚Äôll find out soon
@AnyoneButWenger Yeah, big sign from Favre. Tried to start them both vs Atletico and didn‚Äôt work. Sancho gets nod and likes Bruun Larson‚Äôs discipline
@phil92yeahhh that‚Äôs a hell of a combo. üî•

@tpilch12 @FCDallas @TimbersFC While I don‚Äôt disagree it‚Äôs not entirely a Halloween issue, you can‚Äôt compare Halloween in the UK and USA. I‚Äôve lived in both countries and it‚Äôs 100x more an ‚Äúevent‚Äù here in the USA and a lot of families participate together. It‚Äôs a relevant point

@Huddlestron @SpursOfficial 15 yard penalty?
Poor zone defense from @SpursOfficial - need to step higher and get pressure through the middle on one of Man City‚Äôs 4 quarterbacks.
@JasonKopiteTX @SpursOfficial Yeah, nobody blocking the blitz
Update: Lots of 3 and outs from @SpursOfficial. Quarterback Kane struggling with his wide receivers for possession
@RougeMEF I tweeted the wrong link.. get off your high horse. He‚Äôs just been sacked and it was wrong copy paste
Man City‚Äôs red zone offense looks sharp so far.

Nice to see @ManUtd pressing another team in their own half for once. Have conceded one or two chances in transition, but overall a much more aggressive approach at home. (The way it should be @ Old Trafford)
@Cnyari I disagree it‚Äôs ‚Äúclear‚Äù- He started Pulisic in the more important game vs Atletico Madrid in UCL. While Sancho continues to put up numbers, I think Favre still trusts Pulisic more in big games.
@Kevin__Davies Come back Super Kev https://t.co/Yf7Cfw10YO
Wow. This Dortmund team is for real. @BVB up 4-0 at home against Atletico in Champions League and unbeaten in all comps. We might just have a title race in Germany‚Ä¶..

Rugby lines on the pitch at Old Trafford. Game‚Äôs gone. #UCL
@Ant0nTheGreat Tata is going to Mexico buddy... that ship has sailed.
That being said, I find it hard to see him leaving the situation he has @lafc - same goes for Vermes @ KC. Interesting times ahead.
I‚Äôm sure what happened with Bruce Arena 2nd time around will scare many, but Bob has evolved with the game and continues to improve as a manager. He‚Äôs shown an ability to coach younger players, create a strong culture... and WIN when given the time.
With @LAFC setting record for points in an inaugural season - Bob Bradley has to be @MLS coach of year. I Haven‚Äôt seen his name in #USMNT talk, why? I think he‚Äôd make an excellent choice, he‚Äôd by my #1 right now.
@jamilsatchu We could, but that would be boring.
Zlatan has almost single handedly kept LA Galaxy alive in the playoff race and is coming off major knee surgery. Truly remarkable when you consider the season he has put together.
Before Rooney joined DC United: 2 Wins 7 Draws 5 Losses After Rooney:  12 Wins 4 Draws 3 Losses (*majority of those games pre Rooney were away from home)
@MLS Also food for thought- Listed Salary:  Zlatan Ibrahimovic: $1.5 million Wayne Rooney: $7 million+  Zlatan: 26 GP 22 Goals 10 Assists Rooney: 19 GP 12 Goals 7 Assists
Better 2018 @MLS signing?
If @ColumbusCrewSc continue collapse and don‚Äôt make the playoffs (2 Pt ad. on MTL 1 game)- how would that affect Gregg Berhalter‚Äôs coaching reputation? Have USMNT links affected this team?

Pulisic returns from injury and is on for Dortmund in ‚Äò64 now on FS2. 3-0 up at Stuttgart. Good time for him to make return from injury with @ChampionsLeague next week.
@BMcBride20 Taxi https://t.co/qgdT2SdQ2V
@sam_schell00 @BVB I agree... could push him higher with the competition though. We‚Äôll see how he responds, but Sancho‚Äôs emergence will affect his playing time for sure
@Cnyari Agree... this Dortmund team is fun
Alcacer with ANOTHER goal for @BVB ... Reus and young Jadon Sancho also on target.. 3-0 up after 25 minutes. Lucien Favre has put together a fun and quality team to watch.
@eldiego104ever I‚Äôm saying a couple of months from being in charge
@Pic_FicLand Interesting... is that no Ronaldo or just lack of exposure on TV?
Real Madrid score for first time in 8 hours but lose at home to Levante... is that the end for Julen Lopetegui??? All the drama surrounding his appointment pre World Cup and could be out of a job within a couple months.

@SoccerCooligans Well played.

Julian Gressel is an indispensable piece to this @ATLUTD team. Produces  spectacular goal today and has been so consistent all season long from the right side. 13 assists this year...

Wow Frei with a poor pass, then Picault puts @PhilaUnion up 1-0 on road. @SoundersFC 9 game winning straight about to come to an end. Seattle had so many chances to score but let PHL hang around
@step2jc Watching Seattle!
Errrrr? Not a red - that seems harsh - maybe for the pull of the hair after? https://t.co/Tr5PPUk65h
Hard to see on all the poor camera shots, but seemed incredibly harsh. Ronaldo straight red for off ball incident and leaves field in tears. Judging by his reaction, he was shocked #UCL https://t.co/jsB7tWXSWb

annnnnnnd BOBBY FIRMINOOOOOOOOOOOO @LFC Anfield nights‚Ä¶.. what a beauty
.@WMckennie with the assist on opening goal for Schalke in UCL. Great run from midfield and composed pass to Embolo. Live on @brlive and Pulisic just subbing on for Dortmund.

@Feetwet13 Kudos to her, I don‚Äôt have it in me
@Fecta23 Normally opt for the Kit and Ace navigator pants.... same type of deal and super comfortable. Still wouldn‚Äôt hit the yoga room ha
In Chicago Midway and heard PA announcement for a Yoga Room..... Has anyone actually used one while traveling? Can‚Äôt quite picture my downward dog in skinny jeans.
Well.... @OrlandoCitySC vs @ChicagoFire was about what I expected it to be. Credit to the Fire for the way they approached the game and put on a good performance. Orlando... well yeah - onto next season #MLS
What a game going on in DC right now. 3-3 in second half- goals from Rooney, Acosta, Arriola and then hat rick from BWP. Another for the ages in the #DCU #NYRB rivalry
@MarshallChubby I‚Äôm still processing it

@WMckennie @ussoccer_mnt There it is.. bruised left knee for McKennie. Sounds positive, but no timetable for his return to field. https://t.co/PWmJvvUKTb
Expecting @WMckennie injury update shortly from @ussoccer_mnt - Fingers crossed. Left game in 1st half with left knee sprain. Has had injury issues last year or so
Tyler Adams is a gamer. Love his spirit, mentality and desire to win. Big time goal @tyler_adams14 #usmnt
How many passes have @ussoccer_mnt made in this first half? I like Adams and McKennie in Mf, but in 4-1-4-1, need to find  the ball on half turn more and break lines. Too predictable in possession 1st half
Acosta at RM? Expect him to tuck inside as they rotate to allow Moore move up. Doesn‚Äôt play to his strengths though. Big game for Zardes https://t.co/emcMb8YSI7
@JamesOberdank @BarstoolSam When did I say it was?
@martinjay26 @BarstoolSam Laughable why? Because you know how easy those games are? Experience is invaluable in those games... you really think this group is ready for that?
@BarstoolSam I wasn‚Äôt saying Jozy should be playing yesterday or vs Mexico... these are the right times to give these players games. Jozy absolutely should be starting striker in gold cup and play a part in WCQ until someone dethrones him.
@jwsalazar25 Huh? He has the 3rd most goals in Ussoccer history and is still only 28 years old.
@Goldstein_1 Hopefully logs good minutes with Bremen this year
@COLINREESE How many goals has he scored in Bundesliga last two years?
@boyzinbleu Lol... fair. Get a beer
Slight side note, Super fan @JohnStrong in full support mode for @ThornsFC at Hoboken bar. #NWSL https://t.co/TDFrtyWEKP
Ok then, who‚Äôs a better striker in #USMNT pool than Jozy Altidore? Still best #9 by a long shot

@TaylorTwellman I went Brown but now I‚Äôm struggling on RB‚Äôs. McCoy was first I could pick up
5th pick in Fantasy Football. Antonio Brown or Zeek?
@DJ_Smiley17 He was their top scorer...
@MarkGreene4 He‚Äôs been injured for a little while now... getting closer to fitness
@OfficialfRoD @JasonBWLake fRoD my dudeeeee... still have nightmares about your AWP. Ha ha. Hope all is well man
@MauriceEdu @RobStoneONFOX @FS1 @FOXSoccer üíØ
@scott_sherin Messi
@KWMSmith Yeah, played with Clint a number of times‚Ä¶ guy is a boss. I think Jozy breaks the record.
Less than the listing cost!! https://t.co/1AOjPnQLmH
@skankerdude Take it slow. Work on your mobility early.. joint movement, muscle tone, etc and keep the muscles around the knee very strong. Mechanics very important
@SimonArmstrong9 Also involves World Cup‚Ä¶ and goals in Olympics, vs Haiti and vs Blackburn.
@soccerchris255 Great thanks‚Ä¶ need to pee and the guy next to me doesn‚Äôt want to get up.. might wait until we‚Äôve landed.
@MajorFlaw1 Bah Humbug.
@Revolucion722 I want to see if the young kids can hang with some of the big boys. Also, against Mexico it‚Äôs never a friendly‚Ä¶ so how do they handle that challenge.
@nicbarr87 @AlexiLalas I can‚Äôt reveal trade secrets. #GetOffMyLawn.
@louiebenitezii Waiting to see if @JasonBWLake needs me for @compLexity
@Revolucion722 No, he‚Äôs had 4 coaches in a year at Dortmund and is just getting going for the new season. Let‚Äôs see how he does over the fall.
@KWMSmith I‚Äôm hoping to hear more by Friday. Ear to the ground!
@Revolucion722 If we don‚Äôt have a serious short list by October, I‚Äôm worried.
@J_Densk Man, I have to unpack that in one tweet? I‚Äôd love to see it become less territorial and more collaborative. The problem is MLS will be top of the food chain and surrounding clubs dont want to lose their best players. Training compensation might help.
@_Sean_Bessette_ On an incredible run, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them right now. Brad Smith looks a smart late addition and if Ruidiaz keeps scoring, you‚Äôve got a chance.
I Think Wayne Rooney has pissed off all the people that said he‚Äôd fail in this league. Calling the game last night you can still see his quality and he has an incredible mentality and approach to it. Hope they squeeze in to playoffs - atmosphere at Audi Field was fun. https://t.co/bupYUU0ucc
@KCSGE I will always counter it‚Äôs situational, but I love seeing the talented youngsters go to Europe and push themselves. I personally felt my level raise when I went over at 24 and I would do the same again.
@jtsdad22 I don‚Äôt know what to tell you there.. it‚Äôs another one I struggle with. Terribly average for way too long now and no one above seems to care.
@TheBettingExp Nope.
@MNUnitedFCLoons Not sure I agree on Ibarra, he‚Äôs behind a number of players in that position IMO. You got a good price for Ramirez.. depends what you do with it now.
@W4KRE Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Gary Cahill, Marcos Alonso are top 4 that come to mind
@carlmcg1 Black away kit in 2010. One with yellow trim
@kalfington Can squeeze into a 1 or a 2 I think‚Ä¶ ;) hahah
@jbhinrichsen Earnie Stewart started August 1st. He‚Äôs on the clock.
@crompton_bwfc I still speak with David Wheater / Josh Vela, but don‚Äôt have much of a personal connection to any of the other current squad members. I‚Äôm hoping to get back very soon.. maybe early next year.
@DerexJ Good question. I‚Äôd say Brooks and Miazga right now.
@MattMeacher I‚Äôd say CY Lee from Bolton or Rodrigo Moreno (who‚Äôs at Valencia now)
@ArsenalFCTX #planebae does not run in the family. I‚Äôm next to a business patron it seems.
@BLUESfan1997 What are the key frustrations? I know there are serious issues and I saw that first hand when only 6,000 fans turned up to see the RSL game. No excitement around there right now
@ArsenalFCTX Hmm.. give me a second and I‚Äôll get back to this. I‚Äôm pretty happy with this roster at the moment
@Derek_McA Honestly, I haven‚Äôt watched a Scottish Premier League match other than the Old Firm in years. I grew up an Aberdeen fan, but it‚Äôs hard to find the games and there‚Äôs a lot better football around.
@HMcGee24 Sex Panther
@djgoldman35 Not this season. Man City / Chelsea looking very strong.
@ErikRomeroP This one hurts me to see. I think there needs to be more investment from an organizational standpoint, i.e. front office, etc, and on the playing side to give Wilmer a bigger budget to go and get some stars. Fans / team / FO seem very disconnected.
@ImAToolBoxxx He‚Äôs a top tier USMNT prospect, not a top global prospect yet. Needs a bigger sample size of games and final product. He‚Äôs on the way...
@rkoser I didn‚Äôt see that, but I think it‚Äôs only for official matches with the walk-out.
@bhsmanager @machinegunkelly @Eminem Fill me in, I‚Äôm behind.
@btdickinson @cpulisic_10 Weston McKennie. Big fan of his game and his personality. He has a strong mentality that can take him far.
@sr71fan90 Privacy screen FTW.
@Thesportsfeller That‚Äôs going to be on Earnie Stewart to determine. If it was me, it‚Äôd be a version of 4-3-3 taking advantage of our talented wide players like Weah, Pulisic, etc
@703to843 I like him at Right Back being able to get forward and provide attacking option. Fullbacks have an increased attacking role in today‚Äôs game
@ZachSnyder22 Sadly, barring a miracle, I don‚Äôt think so. #savethecrew
Flying high in the sky- ready to take your questions. Let ‚Äòem rip. Go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

@KMays10 You mean you aren‚Äôt going to over react on every bad pass? How mature and balanced of you.. I think we could do with a few more on that train!
@Kyle_Debelak @ussoccer_mnt @MLS Well Berhalter seems to be the favorite to get the job at the moment‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôd say it doesnt hurt!
@blharreld @ussoccer_mnt @MLS That‚Äôs fair.
@ussoccer_mnt @MLS He has been the beneficiary of Berhalter‚Äôs system in Columbus that has him in and around the goal + getting good service. Same system that  Kamara (Ola and Kei) thrived in and have scored. Biggest challenge will be to reproduce that w #USMNT in 4-1-4-1 Sarachan has been playing.
Based on responses to @ussoccer_mnt roster, Gyasi Zardes call-up brings a mixed reaction. Been critical of his performances for USMNT in past, but he‚Äôs been in excellent form this season. 15 Goals in 27 G and highest scoring American in @MLS. Has earned another shot.
@rachelbonnetta He seems to have the #1 shirt
@Carsten_Grupe I‚Äôd argue some veteran players would force younger players to raise their levels. I think right balance of old/ young is the best recipe
@uppr90 Not playing at club level at moment, needs to get minutes
Sounds like @ussoccer_mnt and @werderbremen agreed to keep Sargent in Bremen to continue development and integration into first team. Scored for U-23‚Äôs other night https://t.co/3JvhTtOkET
Thoughts on #USMNT roster? Pulisic picked up muscle injury with Dortmund and doesn‚Äôt make trip. Still young roster with no veteran players. Big tests with Brazil and Mexico https://t.co/5NW6MjopHe

This BVB-RBL game is a cracker. Dortmund go down a goal early and come firing back before half-time to take 3-1 lead. Pulisic lively on the right. Witsel looks a great addition and Reus always dangerous.

@jshmrt20 I‚Äôm hoping we hear about a shortlist of candidates very soon. I don‚Äôt expect a new coach ahead of September friendlies.
@drosshoya Maybe he can hold out for Miami then?? Ha
@MoJoCU @CACSoccer He has understandably spent a large majority of his time traveling and helping deliver the World Cup in 2026. Huge win. Work being done at the administrative level on committees, etc, to improve work flow and efficiency at highest level. Good start.
The Moyes to #USMNT rumor is just that, a rumor - doesn‚Äôt make sense on many levels. As usual, lots of names will be linked with high profile USMNT job, often times by agents to get free publicity and leverage.

Referee failed to get game under control for 10-15 mins before that and it led to those incidents. VAR communication needs to be better with broadcasters because then they can show replays that lead to final decsision. Something I felt was done well in World Cup by FIFA
Ok- good spot by @MattDoyle76 - After Ruidiaz Threw head into Ziegler, he reacted with hands to his head. IMO both are worthy of cards. Actually don‚Äôt think Ziegler‚Äôs will be rescinded after seeing that. Also, Ruidiaz‚Äôs reaction to the contact is Neymar-esque https://t.co/mh9TjZ3alT

LAFC definitely missing Kaye in this 2nd half. His range, energy and positioning very important for their defensive shape.
@brendanhannan Come on... oh come on.
@toeswiggle @SanAntonioFC @chenoguzman @SportsCenter Going to give it a casual degree of filth.. excellent composure.
@TJBurmesch @StefanBuczko Medium degree
@AlexiLalas ENJOY Panayotis!!
@Brad_Self @Delta Cheers Brad! Hope you‚Äôre well
@Howmuchformynam @Delta Not a plug ha... a loyal diamond flyer actually!
@danjosepher Ha! Nice
After 46 days on the road, 25 flights in 29 days, 8 cities, 17 games, 13,000+ miles in Russia and memories for a life time... it‚Äôs time for one last flight home to the little one!! Heading off the grid for some much needed family time. ‚úàÔ∏è https://t.co/hR0AuPf1pi
@amey014 @FIFAWorldCup @FOXSoccer @raphaelvarane Agree... I‚Äôve seen a few of Pogba as well. People will follow and listen to big and strong characters, no matter the age. Impressive
Love the locker room video. Here‚Äôs Deschamps at half time vs #CRO in #WorldCup Final. Some of my favorites - ‚ÄúGive it to Kylian‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen the energy they are giving‚Äù https://t.co/9MxyHRfYpd https://t.co/7ZyRBvbCnX
It‚Äôs been 3 days and the withdrawals are only getting worse.
@superagent73 Out of touch comment from you. You are lucky to have a journalist like @MarcIles that cares so much about the club. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù consists of more than just owners.. it‚Äôs about the players, fans, and everyone that has invested time, money and their lives towards the club. Sort it out
Bonjour from Paris! What better way to cure my #WorldCup hangover than soak up the #FRA parade on the Champs-Elys√©e https://t.co/IsoJkMEVEr
@PfefferBenji Oh man- you‚Äôre asking me to rack a fried brain lol. In the 17 matches I called there were some damn good ones. Ronaldo FK, Nacho Strike, Cheryshev v CRO. Assist probably James filthy pass to Cuadrado
Decided pre #WorldCup to book a 3 day getaway to Paris with my wife after the Final. Our hotel is 3 blocks from the #FRA parade on the Champs-√âlys√©e... might as well join in. Allez.
@ClemsonMSoccer Thank u guys! Hi to Tiger Town and hope to see you soon #GoTigers
@JSB_TV Thanks JSB!!!!
Best #WorldCup in history. The beautiful game delivered on the World‚Äôs biggest stage. Congrats to deserving champions #FRA and what an incredible run from #CRO
For my @PaniniAmerica Players to Watch for the #WorldCup Final, I enlisted the help from some friends... Better game from Kante or Modric? https://t.co/nPNggwgj6c
This is our travel crew that has done 24 flights in 28 days, over 12,000 miles and 17 games incredible games. (0-0 #DEN #FRA withstanding) None of this would be possible without them. https://t.co/7mNkmSZHUj
An immense amount of work goes into these productions behind the scenes and I‚Äôm incredibly proud to be part of the @FOXSoccer crew and the work we‚Äôve done. It‚Äôs been a long and intense month, but we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Let‚Äôs knock it out of the park today. #FRA #CRO https://t.co/QMvPDoYQwq
I get the privilege of calling the #WorldCup Final with @JohnStrong today, pretty damn cool. It‚Äôs been a crazy and amazing month of planes, trains, cars, meals, laughs, sleepless nights, hotel rooms and amazing games with this crew. (1/3) https://t.co/0KF6BaACnO
@AndrewWatkins18 Yes. Needs to be changed. Two for whole tournament is crazy
@Smarty3385 I think hes also so important because Martinez didn‚Äôt have much depth wide to play the system he wanted to
I think if Meunier played for Belgium in Semi-Final, they would‚Äôve beaten France. #MondayMorningQB

@RobertMosesFox5 Thanks Robert!
@DanThomasESPN Favorite part was @pietvanleer getting hot tea all over himself ü§£ü§£
What a performance from #CRO again... battled their way through the knock outs and place in the final well deserved. Modric and Rakitic good again, but Perisic and Rebic caused #ENG Problems all night. Manduzkic the hero. #WorldCup
@ReissNelsongoat 1-9. Not fair.
@MJ_McGuinness @Jrodius I would die for a telestrator my friend, unfortunately we don‚Äôt control the picture and cuts. It‚Äôs all done from a World Feed and you‚Äôre not allowed per FIFA. üëé(boo)

Fascinating match between two top level teams. Interesting to see if Belgium bluff on their tactical graphic again. Join us next on @FOXTV https://t.co/FFMn3eVEc8
@AveritteBrad Ooo I like it, would be a good game. I think you‚Äôd hurt me on the counter attack but struggle to keep my offense off the board. Judge rules 5:2 victory to team Holden.
@stareagle Offense wins champi.. oh wait... Best offense is the best form of defense? Let's go with that.
@SaversScent Strikers rely on service and he's against one of the best defenses in the competition. He's also the clear leader for the Golden boot- he's in my team all day long.
@KeepersBeauty @ivanrakitic That was also a tough decision. It became him or Modric next to Kant√©
@wnetterville I secretly think Kant√© enjoys that part of the game.
@ajstravs all part of the plan.
@ajstravs We'd rotate around and cover well defensively.
@EvertonianJamie Been underwhelmed by Umtiti (conceded penalty vs AUS), Maguire was in for a shout and I chose Varane as central in the 3- Stones was close.
Oh man, Great question. Ok, here we go:   3-4-3: Courtois; Trippier-Varane-Vida; De Bruyne, Modric, Kante, Hazard ; Mbapp√©, Kane, Lukaku   Not sure how that would look tactically, but there you go. https://t.co/EDkbuCAQCj

So what's the verdict on Mark Geiger's performance last night in #ENG #COL match? I think he handled a difficult match well and was spot on with the penalty decision. Players on both sides did him no favors.

PAVARD. OH MY MY... flawless technique to cut down on that. Magnifique #FRA
#FRA are unbeaten in their last 18 World Cup games in which they‚Äôve scored first (16 Wins 2 Ties). Last time they lost after scoring 1st was vs Poland in 1982.  Do they have it in them to turn it back around? #WorldCup

Live look at Umtiti and Varane defending today #FRAARG https://t.co/XknxOdPmqJ
@AlexiLalas @TaylorTwellman Taxi for Lalas.
@BigGameGoat05 Because he's going wide and his defender is engaging. No need to come out and he wouldn't have influenced play
@XFactor10 I understand the idea.. just dont think it will work.
Horrible defending by #ARG .. And then for Rojo.. he sees Mbapp√©'s run for 25 yards and yet still doesn't back off? The touches and acceleration from Mbapp√© were ridiculous though!!!!
Somewhat baffled by #ARG formation with Messi as False #9. Not sure where the depth in their play will come from- Di Maria and Pavon have to hug touchlines and get behind #FRA FB's.

Manuel Neuer at today‚Äôs presser:  "We talked a lot about what we have to do better. I know what has been written in the press but trust me, we were harsher than that on ourselves. We are so mad and disappointed with what we showed against Mexico" Loss might spark #GER https://t.co/W4DF21EPI9

@Nursedudesteve @MoSalah @PaniniAmerica @FIFAWorldCup Even if he‚Äôs risking further serious injury? Big call. I get the feeling he starts
@danieltyree @MoSalah @PaniniAmerica @FIFAWorldCup It would be a personal risk to him if he‚Äôs not ready no? How do you balance that dilemma
I was at training today and saw @MoSalah back in training for #EGY ahead of huge match with #RUS. He is my @paniniamerica player to watch, because without him, #EGY could find themselves out of the @fifaworldcup. Should they risk him from the start? https://t.co/zSYOXDxEN0

Poor quality first half between #egy and #uru but not helped in the slightest by the long grass and dry pitch. One of my biggest pet peeves. Slows tempo and hard to get a rhythm. #worldcup
@Eric_Graffer I'm on the road brother- 3 games in 3 days, cant wait.
Mo Salah starts on the bench for #EGY in their opening match vs #URU - Cautious approach the right one IMO from coach Hector Cuper.   Trezeguet a very interesting player starting on left. Had excellent season in Turkey scoring 16 Goals.

@PaniniAmerica @FioreOficial @FIFAWorldCup @FernandoFiore brother - who's going to score goals for La Albiceleste??? (other than Messi) #playertowatch
BIG NEWS, I‚Äôve joined the @PaniniAmerica family and was welcomed by the main man ‚ÄòEl Presidente‚Äô @fioreoficial !! Stay tuned for my player to watch from the biggest games at the @fifaworldcup.   Who should I pick for my first game between üá™üá∏ vs üáµüáπ ? CR7 https://t.co/wTDqWWtwbM
Off the plane cameo. https://t.co/bIXninY4kf
@the_crotty @FOXSoccer I hear ya on that, worried about them beyond the group stage
Rock bathing is big in Sochi. Can‚Äôt wait to lie down.... ü§î#worldcup https://t.co/F3PKyf3bGF
@UrrutiaMarioA @ussoccer_mnt @CACSoccer @sunilgulati @united2026 Still TBD
@chriszop @RobStoneONFOX @AlexiLalas @ipswichtwn @grossman @JohnStrong Just touched down in Sochi.. 80 degrees, is this a vacation? Thanks zop!
Excellent and tireless work by @CACSoccer @sunilgulati and everyone at @united2026 over past months and years. Endless meetings, airplanes and effort. Huge congratulations https://t.co/tGGKrxPhYl
Landed in Sochi to news that #WORLDCUP2026 is coming to USA, MEXICO and CANADA! Oh... and Spain fired their undefeated coach, Julien Lopetegui, two days before first match of #WorldCup. We‚Äôre off to a flying start.... https://t.co/Km8wuuKwyg
@PamDawnPerkins @united2026 Great work Pam!!!
The #WorldCup2026 will officially be held in USA üá∫üá∏ , MEXICO üá≤üáΩ and Canada üá®üá¶ !! Man, that sounds good to say!!!!   Monumental moment for the World‚Äôs game in North America! 60/80 games will be playing in United States.
And we‚Äôre off.... tournament hasn‚Äôt event started yet!! https://t.co/D18MGu4Wf6
Best of luck @united2026 !!! Would transform the game in USA, Mexico and Canada. Countdown is on.... https://t.co/pQn7PcZ0f5
@SteveNash Bruh, how you going to let the American superstar run around on grass in runners... nearly had a heart attack when he slipped. Typical Canadian move (he still skinned you)
@Guerrero_Cule25 @FOXSoccer What was the score for his team again?
@jakecastillooo You‚Äôll probably have to use a VPN to tunnel your IP back to the USA- try TunnelBear
Woah... didn‚Äôt see that one coming. Spanish manager Lopetegui will join @realmadrid after #WorldCup - shouldn‚Äôt impact performance at tournament https://t.co/VBKxMYKojv
üôåüôå see you soon https://t.co/ewKynXd2A6
@kylemartino Best way to play it, just ask David Moyes!
3rd player of year for @timream5 in UK (2 with Bolton and 1 with Fulham) yet still somehow for #USMNT feels massively underused and underrated? https://t.co/ORZsddhmf1
@GrantWahl Great work here Grant... awesome.
Comfort food in Russia = Kale Salad. Feed the Bear @TMeola1 #WORLDCUP   T-minus 3 days until we kick this thing off. https://t.co/6qxQZzvE8B
@RobStoneONFOX @rachelbonnetta A month of this game is going to be fun.
@RealVitoDElia @FOXSoccer Cool, you were probably the same guy saying that in 2014 and cop america centenario.
@scotthamilton92 @FOXSoccer Cool, so they are a guarantee after they got smashed by Germany in ‚Äò14 and didn‚Äôt get out of group in copa American centenario?
@TheMengisKhan Couldn‚Äôt disagree more. Casemiro, Paulinho and Renato Augusto cover the entire pitch between them. Really important for them
Random World Cup Thought #3: Brazil are really really good and will make a deep run. Really nice balance between tactical discipline, midfield power and attacking flair. Big Tite fan.
Neymar doing Neymar things. Returns from injury layoff and scores against Croatia in 1st game and now vs Austria in 2nd. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be a lack of sharpness!

@jelliott62280 @FOXSports I just asked a question?
Should Christian Pulisic be playing in this game?
Watching my mentions like https://t.co/PLE8fVQCVz
System isn‚Äôt broken, we‚Äôre beating a World Cup contender
The VAR seminar really got to @DrJoeMachnik #Day2 https://t.co/nZma6xacOJ
@danipas_2000 Buena temporada Dani y gracias por haberme prestado tus zapatos!!!
Inside the @FIFAWorldCup VAR room. VARY interesting. https://t.co/yhwQWbr4RB
@AlexiLalas @LAFC @LAGalaxy @ussoccer_acad @ussoccer_ref Big question, did you use VAR?
@pedrini9 Cristian Pavon is already part of the 23 my friend!
This is horrifically sad... Bourdain was the best at what he did - a name that is synonymous with good food, personality and television. His legacy will live on  https://t.co/VK7G5K3kAR
@JoyTaylorTalks Congrats Joy!
@thomasghancock @FOXSports Dare you
@TheyWereKones @coachdansmith @FOXSports @FIFAWorldCup I‚Äôve always got time for Dan. Yes they will all be there my friend
Random World Cup Thought #2: David Silva will continue club form and have a big tournament for Spain. Free role off the wing for Lopetegui allows for his creative qualities to shine. &gt; 2 Goals 3 assists
And @FIFAcom entering into a kneeling/standing issue (calm down) on throw-ins.  Law 15: "A player must stand to take a throw-in (kneeling, sitting etc. not permitted)"  Twitter: "A player must stand and not kneel.. BLASPHEMY.. !!!!"  Me: Pour one out for the flip throw. RIP
If you're interested in the rest of the changes, you can find them here: https://t.co/srEB6ZtobM  Shout our @foxsoccer Rules Analyst and FIFA Match commissioner @DrJoeMachnik for any explanations.
FIFA Released the revised "Laws of the Game" ahead of the World Cup effective June 1st, 2018. I have a feeling we know why this one was added @LuisSuarez9 "Law 12: Biting is included as a direct free kick and sending-off offence"
Get her in the first team. Top bin, what a strike #BWFC https://t.co/RPHTKASueC
@BradyWacka @moraisfilipe20 @A1F1E9 What a strike! Top bin
Not sure how @JohnStrong got the feature picture, but couldn‚Äôt be more excited to share the booth with this guy in Russia. 1st ever TV broadcast was with him in 2014 and here we are... See you soon for @FIFAWorldCup on @FOXTV https://t.co/ckcKxkFL7a
@warrenbarton2 @neymarjr I said not many Waz! Neymar is there üòú
@JustinGardiner @teamoluoch @ManCity I would‚Äôve left off Brandt. They play similar position. Reus was really good when he came back from injury and ozil is different level with Germany
@coachdansmith @ManCity Sorry, must have missed it amidst studying for 32 teams. Please forgive me üòù
@YoungHOKOO @ManCity Beyond the stats, San√© had breakout season and was integral part of title winning team. Would be wrong if you didn‚Äôt at least question it? Loew has the credentials to back his decision.
@teamoluoch @ManCity Kimmich is there mate, bottom of the defenders list. He‚Äôs a banker to start
Wow. No San√© (14 G 19 A for @ManCity) in Germany squad. Julian Brandt gets nod after a solid season at Leverkusen. Neuer in final 23 more than likely means he‚Äôs starter throughout tournament. https://t.co/fHjyOlmNmx
@ChildishRobbino Don‚Äôt fight it.
Random World Cup Thought #1: Kylian Mbapp√© is going to have a huge tournament. Not many better players 1 v 1 in the world, so fast and so smooth.   &gt; 4 goals ‚úÖ
@kylemartino @JohnStrong Cheers brother. John needs extra luck in order to spend 6 weeks with me
@ddown_13 @pietrantonio_n @FIFAWorldCup @FOXSoccer @FOXSports @FS1 You want in on the action?

@worldsoccertalk @FIFAWorldCup @FOXSoccer @FOXSports @FS1 Big debate on if plane ride should consist of Germany or Spain prep.
Wheels up... 11 days until first match... see you soon Mother Russia üá∑üá∫. Let‚Äôs get this party started @FIFAWorldCup https://t.co/3KES2Qfbv6
@MarkGreene4 Havent even thought about it because it makes me sad.
@ShannanT88 There are no official candidates yet, because GM will be leading that search. As for MLS coaches, there are some very talented young coaches in the league and worthy of being in the mix. Coaches that all know the player pool very well
@Joey_glenn4 Might have to knock the dust off!
Lebron was just VAR‚Äôed
Great class, many congrats to all of the 2018 @soccerhof inductees!! https://t.co/diV7GxgOaM
@briangstrong Yup. #parenting
Zidane leaves Madrid on top and can hand pick any job he wants. Where does he go? Maybe he takes a year away before ending up at @ManUtd
Still working on @EricLichaj to join the mighty Wanderers @OfficialBWFC ! Offer of microbrew IPA seems to be helping. #coyw https://t.co/xYOkMW8v6s
@ThatDamnYank @BenBaer89 There were multiple journalists there that I‚Äôm sure will be putting pieces out in the coming days. I had 1:30 at halftime, did best I could for ya!
@BenBaer89 Stop talking sense
@ChrisWGluck You tuned into this game to watch Bolivia? Give me a break pal. 95% of focus is on the USMNT in a game like that.
@Bren_ohhh @DiCiccoMethod Most of the ‚Äúpower‚Äù nations around the world have a similar position. Seems to work for Germany with Oliver Bierhoff? But keeping hating if you want to.
@ChrisWGluck Huh? Were you listening at all? We said multiple times how poor Bolivia were... also that it was essentially their C team and a total of 30 caps other than keeper. Keep up.
@ap_rambo10 @FOXSoccer Ridiculous to draw that as your only conclusion. GM will have plenty of influence and it‚Äôs an important role
@ShannanT88 Nope
@Jaybeezwax @FS1 @ussoccer dare you
@roadkit @FS1 @ussoccer it was a typo. Bono always the starter
#PlayYourKids now on @FS1 https://t.co/TEDMtKoP6v
@the_bonnfire Check in the mail.
@FS1 @ussoccer Excited to see more of Weah and for our first look at Josh Sargent.
Join us now on @FS1 for @ussoccer vs Bolivia. Kick-Off moments away.   USA XI: Bono; Lichaj, Zimmerman, Palmer-Brown, Robinson; McKennie; Weah, Corona, Pulisic, Rubin; Sargent.
@ChaseTheCreator @JohnStrong National team level? Solid.
@gabaldonart Cheers üëç
@richarddeitsch Or the huge soccer friendly between USA-Bolivia on @FS1. Pulisic &gt; Curry

@derrickheydon Great shout thx
@AleBedoya17 Remember the people just hate on Lebron because he‚Äôs Lebron? Greatness is undeniable.
Lebron James. Respect. Guy is a beast.
That dunk from Tatum though...... oh my.
@FaancyFootwork @FOXSoccer @JohnStrong Good afternoon. üëç
@lukevanpatten14 Cheers Luke lad! See you for some footy soon?

PROMOTION!!!!! YESSSSS @RCD_Mallorca - congrats to all the players, staff and fans on a FANTASTIC season. All the hard work all year long and to maintain such a high level is an incredible achievement. What a job by Vicente Moreno, players and staff!!!
@gailrongen @TRongen Of course, sending good vibes! Have you heard of https://t.co/g04EEg4nLI  ?
@ProRelForUSA @ussoccer @RCD_Mallorca Took you ten minutes to get that in, come on.. keep up.

@HotDogBurp You should be thankful, that intercourse created you
Oh and Zidane üôåüèº Guy is a winner. End of story.
UCL Recap: 1. Hope injuries to Carvahal &amp; Salah aren‚Äôt too severe, both looked devastated. 2. It‚Äôs a hard foul from Ramos on Salah and he certainly pulls him, but contrary to my mentions - not a dirty challenge with intent to injure. 3. Bale off the charts üî•üî• 4. Karius üò¢
That would be a relief if true. He‚Äôs been a pleasure to watch and would love to see him at World Cup https://t.co/IhanskARc8

Kennady was pretty upset about #Iniesta leaving @FCBarcelona and decided to sit by herself on the field after nap time today. She sat still from 1:30 PM until 1:32 PM without moving.
