I'm visiting Washington to give testimony to @HouseIntel on how the rise of autocracies affects global security - Tuesday 10.00 EST. I'll be talking about the work of @AoDemocracies to strengthen the backbone of the world's democracies to protect our values. https://t.co/i7dd3npo2L
Today marks 5 years the brutal killings at Euromaiden. We remember those that died fighting for a more free Ukraine and are reminded of the steep price that Ukraine and its people continue to pay in places like Donbas and Crimea in their fight for freedom and democracy.
Tonight’s final episode of #ToEurope is a visit to the UK, a special one where I could hear why citizens remain committed to #Brexit and @DamianGreen shares his optimism for future UK-EU relations - we also taste some British bubbly - watch on @dr2tv at 22.00 https://t.co/y1p5bfkw07
Finally, the Pledge for Election Integrity is open to all existing and hopeful candidates in the upcoming European elections, which you can take at https://t.co/kmXunXGSGw
I would like to thank @ManfredWeber @TimmermansEU @ZahradilJan @guyverhofstadt @SkaKeller @BasEickhout for being the 1st signatories to this pledge. We cannot allow foreign meddlers to have a say in our elections w/o putting up a fight - we must defend our democratic institutions
Today at @MunSecConf, I am launching the Pledge for Election Integrity with @JoeBiden @MarietjeSchaake @JeanneMeserve. Candidates taking the pledge promise to preserve free &amp; fair elections by not spreading disinfo, stolen material &amp; increasing transparency
I had the privilege to discuss Georgia with Prime Minister Bakhtadze in Munich.   Georgia is a valued ally to the West and I look forward to the day when it becomes a fully-integrated part of the Euro-Atlantic alliance. #MSC2019 https://t.co/SAzpcAu8yC

Today at 16.00cet we’ll launch the @AoDemocracies Pledge for Election Integrity at #MSC2019, inviting candidates and parties to commit they will not assist foreign meddlers. We’ve written why we’re initiating this pledge in several European newspapers. Thread:
Times may change, but our commitment to freedom and democracy cannot. I’ve signed onto a declaration by @AtlanticCouncil today and invite all freedom and democracy-lovers to do the same: https://t.co/XKDojT6FjR #DefendDemocracy https://t.co/l5YqlSM3NA
#ToEurope visits Spain this week where we meet members of the #Catalonian independence movement to hear their view, and former PM Aznar gives his. I also meet @pbustinduy MP from the left-wing Podemos party. @dr2tv 22.00 Monday https://t.co/ARTw3pvByc
#ToEurope visits #France this week where we talk Burgundy and President @EmmanuelMacron’s EU agenda with MP @SabineThillaye, Chair of the French European Relations Committee, @enmarchefr @dr2tv 22.00 Monday. https://t.co/1mPXbO9DAV
Hopefully, negotiations on an updated and modernized INF treaty can be initiated. A new nuclear arms race on the European continent would be dangerous.
I regret that the US has suspended membership of the INF Treaty. But never forget that it is Russia that has turned back the clock on nuclear proliferation, repeatedly violating its commitments.
I'm visiting #Ukraine today and addressing supporters of my friend President @poroshenko with one message: Ukraine should continue the reforms. They are not easy, but every time I visit Ukraine, I leave confident that it has a bright future, if it stays the course.
Week 3 of #ToEurope coming up in Italy 🇮🇹. We talk protest movements with 5 Star, EU successes and mistakes with Romano Prodi, anger with Barolo winemakers, and I tell the story of when Silvio Berlusconi invited me to a bunga-bunga party! Monday 21.30 @dr2tv https://t.co/6koWcFJgpD
I spoke to Nordic and Swiss businesses in Zürich to highlight the importance for businesses to speak up as supporters of a liberal world order and free market economy. They rely on it. Now they also need to defend it. https://t.co/4yNkV9MNQT
The next episode of #ToEurope19 airs Monday 21.30 on @dr2tv. This week Morten and I are in Hungary looking at the border fence, discussing EU enlargement, &amp; nationalism. The best antidote to extremism is for politicians to engage with legitimate concerns. #skålforeuropa https://t.co/BSayZPmeil
Also a reminder that 🇺🇦 remains ground-zero for 🇷🇺 disinfo tactics – along with @PinchukFund @AtlanticCouncil, the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity has launched a Ukraine Election Taskforce to monitor March's Presidential election in Ukraine https://t.co/R10q01U2p1
Facebook’s move to take down 2 Russian-affiliated disinfo networks in Ukraine and Central/Eastern Europe is a strong sign that the social media giant is listening and trying to improve – I hope to hear similar stories during this election-filled year https://t.co/Q1M3ZGh3XT

A year ago, Michael Chertoff, @JoeBiden and I decided to unite against the threat of election meddling across the democratic world. Since then, the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity has made real progress. We met today to discuss next steps: https://t.co/9zQQJPzwCr https://t.co/9d4vZ4lM7e
As co-chair of the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity I discussed the importance of bi-partisan efforts to prevent foreign interference in next year’s US Presidential election with @RepAdamSchiff and @RepZoeLofgren. @AoDemocracies https://t.co/rwXWeketnm
I’m on Capitol Hill today reinforcing the need for the new Congress to stand firm and united with Europe in responding to Russian aggression and election meddling. Great meetings so far including my friend @MittRomney. https://t.co/8cl70IQCIh

Jim Mattis was a pleasure to work with - a leader who understood that America’s comparative advantage emanates from its leadership of a global alliance of democracies. He also understood what happens when the US retreats: autocracies advance. https://t.co/BevMcAOtrn

#Strasbourg has long been a symbol of peace and unity. I am deeply sad to see that tonight its Christmas markets have been targeted for a cowardly attack. My thoughts are with all of those affected - but our unity and the strength of our freedom and democracy will always prevail.

Important piece in @nytimes by @poroshenko: Words of condemnation are important, but it's time for Western action in response to Russia's aggression.   Continued appeasement - especially in parts of Europe - risks the security of the West.    https://t.co/mk9iJyyCQ2

Today, we mourn with the American people at the loss of a great leader &amp; celebrate a life lived in the service of a higher calling. I remember fondly my meetings with President Bush; his wisdom, disarming humour and conviction of the benefits of US global leadership. #BushFuneral https://t.co/hPzLI8qyGF
The reason to take disinformation and election meddling seriously now is that the playbook is about to morph - with AI completely changing the game. Deepfake videos are just one example - and we are working on AI tools to detect them. @AoDemocracies #TCEI https://t.co/9zQQJPzwCr https://t.co/ZkRwFPQAqN
At Hudson, I put election interference into the wider context - because events in the Kerch Strait, the Donbas conflict, chemical weapons on English streets, cyber-attacks on government servers, or meddling in the US Presidential election - are all the same side of a 🇷🇺 coin. https://t.co/3zYyJJumJi
George HW Bush was a great American who devoted his life to two noble causes: Public Service, as an 18 yr old enlisting, to the highest offices in the world; and building a loving, successful family who my family are proud to call friends. Condolences from Anne-Mette and I. https://t.co/Bgcd60YPED

Russia’s aggression in the Sea of #Azov must stop immediately: after ramming a Ukrainian ship, they have now opened fire.   Moscow’s illegal actions must be met with a robust international response.   Putin responds only to power.
Regardless, today is a sad day as we say goodbye to a fellow member; but we should also try to remember the optimism of 2002 and recognise that we have not lost a crucial NATO ally, a strong partner and a friend.
Mrs May of course has to sell the deal she has, and cannot talk about a plan B; but other options should be kept on the table if parliament refuses the deal - including ‘Norway for Now’. It has its sticking points and would need modifications, but could offer a staging post.
The immediate question is, whether through ideology or tactical considerations, British MPs will support the Withdrawal Agreement. Anything can happen, but as things stand, a majority isn’t forthcoming. I believe the only option that must be taken off the table is a brutal Brexit
Britain will not cease being our ally, neighbour and friend after Brexit - and it will continue to be a partner in protecting democratic values in the face of autocratic and protectionist headwinds.
@theresa_may has worked tirelessly to find an agreement that creates minimal disruption. More critically this deal enables us to move into the next stage and forge an ambitious partnership. The U.K. is an island, not a boat.
We are all smaller because of this divorce and my own country - 🇩🇰- will greatly miss the British perspective in the EU room.
16 years ago, I was proud to hold the EU rotating Presidency as we negotiated the bloc’s biggest enlargement at a time of untold optimism. The UK played a crucial role in that success, and in the development of today’s EU - from single market to open trade &amp; security cooperation.
5 years ago today, Ukrainians took to the streets to demand a better future. Five years on, Ukraine is closer to Europe than ever. There is more to do to fulfil the promise of #Maidan, but there can be no doubt that #Ukraine has a bright future if it stays the course. https://t.co/6RHoZVkO6l
Here’s a piece I wrote on the issue last year: https://t.co/yaRidH8DpN

We must stop focusing on divisions and focus on what unites us. Because if we fragment and descend into these self-defeating dynamics, there will be only two winners: Putin and Xi Jinping. #WSF2018
Seeing such a volatile world, I decided to do what I can as a citizen - so I formed the @AoDemocracies to unite the world’s democratic nations and work together to defend the values that we hold dear.
While 🇷🇺 sees the world as a chess board, and 🇨🇳 sees it as a game of Monopoly, many in the West continue to see it as a game of Scrabble – where words seem to count more than actions and interests. No wonder our responses are inadequate.  #WSF2018
In so many ways - global disease, poverty, connectivity - the 🌎 is a much better place today. But geopolitically, it is on fire. 🇺🇸 role as a global 👮‍♂️ has been challenged. Instead of rising to the challenge, it is going into retirement. #WSF2018
Poland’s history is full of heroes. They fought according to the motto taken up by the 🇵🇱 RAF squadrons - ‘for your freedom &amp; ours’. Those brave Battle of Britain pilots line up among the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising, the leaders of Solidarnosc and millions who opposed tyranny

I remember our meetings, his disarming humour, clarity about his beliefs, but a willingness to hear other arguments. He was never afraid to pick a fight or to put himself in harm’s way. But, above all, he loved his family. Our thoughts go out to Roberta, Cindy and his children.
John McCain will be remembered as a great American - a hero and maverick, who saw America as not just a country, but an infectious idea. His entire life was spent fighting for the cause of freedom and countless people live in greater liberty because of his life’s work. 1/2 https://t.co/D4QMexhBvN

(3/3) We should stop Moscow's aggression in Georgia and its invasion of Ukraine. Most Georgians –  &amp; Ukrainians – still hold the ambition to one day join NATO. NATO member states should uphold Bucharest Pledge to assist those looking to join the international rules-based order.

The creation of the world's largest open trade zone between 🇪🇺🇯🇵 shows that we are not sailing into protectionist and anti-democratic headwinds alone. Europe's relationship with Japan is based on shared values as well as shared interests.
Other reasons : - fomented war in Ukraine (10,000+ casualties) &amp; Illegally annexed Crimea - Interfered in votes across Atlantic - Bombed civilians in Syria to protect Assad - Used chemical agents on streets of NATO ally Relations will improve only when Russia's behaviour changes.
4 years ago 298 people were killed on flight #MH17 by a Russian missile. My thoughts go out to their families. To this day there is no sign of acceptance or remorse by Moscow - one of many reasons our relations with Russia degraded 1/2
We cannot turn back the 🕘 on democracy and lose our hard-fought freedoms. Advocates of democracy met last month at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit to #defenddemocracy. It’s time to make democracy great again! #CDS2018 https://t.co/MLntTm044h
Despite his unorthodox approach, @realDonaldTrump has a point. German taxpayers reluctant to pay for the southern Eurozone should understand why US taxpayers question paying more for Europe's defence, I've written in @SZ how Europe cannot go it alone. https://t.co/yIlYOz6dD0
Europeans need to spend more on defence. But to pretend the USA doesn’t gain from #NATO ignores 70 years of relative peace that enabled the USA to become the strongest, richest power on earth. It didn’t happen by accident but through American 🌎 leadership https://t.co/jrgjKCkvDC

We’re halfway through a day of stimulating discussion at #CDS2018. It is a pleasure to see this exciting summit unfold and to welcome both old and new friends to Copenhagen to #DefendDemocracy https://t.co/LEJrYfpXzM
Today’s the 1st meeting of the Transatlantic Commission on Electoral Integrity, an initiative I co-founded w Fmr 🇺🇸 Sec Homeland Security Michael Chertoff.   We’ll welcome leaders to discuss &amp; debate the future of free elections - follow the day @AoDemocracies #stopmeddling
Democracies are losing hearts &amp; minds of citizens, 🌎 largest study on trust in government finds.

We’re almost ready for the Copenhagen Democracy Summit hosted by @AoDemocracies 🇩🇰 Do you have a question about the future of democracy that you’re dying to ask our panelists?   @StephenSackur might read yours out on Friday - use #DefendDemocracy and ask away! https://t.co/QAKtREoilR
A busy week to #DefendDemocracy in Copenhagen.   Thursday: first meet of the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity (https://t.co/9zQQJPzwCr)   Friday: first Copenhagen Democracy Summit #CDS18. @JoeBiden and Tony Blair among many leaders speaking  https://t.co/ttYMURclEm
Positive progress being made to strengthen our screening of strategic investments in Europe. Investment is welcome but we must also protect strategic interests. Closer cooperation between Japan, EU and US on strategic investments is key. https://t.co/7FbK075kbv
G7 leaders agree to boost cooperation to prevent, thwart and respond to malign interference by foreign actors against democratic processes. The challenge to #stopmeddling faces the whole democratic world. We must unite in our response. Watch this space: https://t.co/9zQQJPzwCr
The adoption of the Anti Corruption Court in #Ukraine's @UA_parliament is a positive step forward and an important milestone. The Bill should be fully implemented without delay.
I’ve spent the morning in Berlin, talking to @business, taking part in @welt’s editorial meeting, and a web chat with Die Welt readers. Much concern about the state of the transatlantic alliance. Now heading to Utah for a US perspective. https://t.co/qzycNvvZW0
Writing in @politico Michael Chertoff and I explain why we’ve formed the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity to amplify work being carried out to #protectelections from meddling, and to fill gaps in our collective response. https://t.co/baGe6PaFJ0
Open markets and trade will be a key theme of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on 22nd June: https://t.co/ttYMURclEm
Apart from hitting jobs and industries, a transatlantic trade war makes both US and EU miss out on working together on the big economic threat ahead: China’s unfair trade practices and thirst for Western technology
President Trump has just levied a tax on American consumers. A trade war and a further transatlantic divide is a mistake we cannot afford in a turbulent world. I hope we can de-escalate this situation because free trade creates jobs; this action destroys them - on both sides.
This is a must-read for anyone standing for election, working on elections or seeking to protect the integrity of our democratic processes ⬇️ https://t.co/ElMjE6KHBQ
The JIT is clear: #MH17 and 298 innocent people on board were murdered by a Russian missile. Not to mention the 10,000+ people killed in the Donbas war fomented by Moscow. The West must not consider normalising relations until Russia changes its behaviour. https://t.co/ynbkrCKqBF
Anlässlich der Reise von Angela Merkel nach Peking habe ich in @welt meine Bedenken geäußert, warum sich Europa nicht blindlings in Chinas Arme begeben sollte, ohne sich zuvor ausreichend und gemeinsam vor Pekings geopolitischen Ambitionen zu wappnen. https://t.co/mURVFgsD5y
Other malign states will use Russia's playbook to interfere in our elections, unless our resilience on both sides of the Atlantic is significantly increased.   This is why we've formed the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity.  https://t.co/vngNoffMMK
Very worthwhile read by @TomTugendhat and @CommonsForeign on how the U.K. needs a comprehensive strategy on Russian malign influence, including in The City. Lessons here for across Europe. https://t.co/PuGTI4qLH2

The Kerch bridge between Russia and Crimea, opened by Putin today, cements Russia’s violation of international law and impedes access to Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea. #crimeaisukraine and so are the waters around it.
Last weekend I had the privilege of meeting these Danish trainee Air Force pilots. They were unimpressed that I was not yet on Instagram. So I’ve started an account - go to https://t.co/6L2mVxp3Z0 to follow me. https://t.co/mnp0q9GVlq
Today we announced the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity. Go to https://t.co/9zQQJPzwCr and follow Members @JoeBiden @FelipeCalderon @nick_clegg @EileenDonahoe @JeanineHennis @IlvesToomas @njaresko @tanit @JeanneMeserve @PinchukFund @MarietjeSchaake @joannashields https://t.co/mcXE7zzM9v
Michael Chertoff and I are announcing the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity at the National Press Club in DC https://t.co/9zQQJPzwCr https://t.co/HEkwlFGWRa
This is a transatlantic challenge and it needs transatlantic solutions. https://t.co/aTWKvhWLhP
I'm extremely grateful to @JoeBiden @FelipeCalderon @nick_clegg @EileenDonahoe @JeanineHennis @IlvesToomas @njaresko @tanit @JeanneMeserve @PinchukFund @MarietjeSchaake @joannashields who have agreed to join the Commission. Each member brings a unique perspective and experience https://t.co/3bcybRtBnY
We have taken unprecedented collective steps to protect ourselves from conventional attacks – especially in eastern Europe – but these efforts have not been matched by vital protections to our democratic processes. That needs to change.
The Commission will fill a void in transatlantic coordination, identifying and plugging gaps and raising awareness from governments to citizens; and it will look into the level of risk exposure across Western countries and ask how technology can address the problem.
Former US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and I are bringing together a group of leaders in politics, tech, media &amp; business to launch a transatlantic, bipartisan commission on election integrity to identify our weaknesses and propose solutions.
With over 20 major Western elections by 2020, the opportunities for external meddling and interference are immense, and our defences are lacking. We need to work across the Atlantic to tackle this common challenge.
Great to meet 20 ambitious pilot aspirants at the Danish Flying School in Karup. We need those dedicated young people for the Royal Danish Airforce and for NATO. @forsvaretdk #NATO https://t.co/bRGKsPmXEQ
Thank you to everyone who alerted me that this account was hacked yesterday alongside other European politicians'. I'm now back in control. We're working to find out what happened and to prevent a repeat - but the work to promote freedom and democracy continues.

Barbara Bush was a great American whose life embodied American values of family, service and volunteerism. My and Anne-Mette's thoughts today go out to Presidents Bush 41 and 43, and the entire Bush family. https://t.co/W6SqciYBkI
Important day for trade as Japan and Singapore trade deals to be agreed by the EU.   With Japan especially, we send a signal that two of the world’s largest economies will defend freedom and rules-based open trade. Well done @jyrkikatainen @MalmstromEU!   https://t.co/3LtalgBMZg
The US, UK and France have taken necessary action. These limited, targeted strikes against Assad’s ability to wage chemical warfare send a strong deterrent signal. What’s needed now is a Western strategy for Syria, Assad and the region.
Once again Russia has sided with Assad in rejection of all norms of the rules-based order. The US and allies must send a strong signal to Assad, Putin and all other tyrants/autocrats. Action is always a tough decision, but we’ve seen the cost of inaction.
Important from Chancellor Merkel on Nord Stream 2, accepting it's not just "an economic issue but there are also political considerations".   NS2 is a platform for Russian coercion and a geopolitical mistake, especially in current climate. Time to stop it. https://t.co/83hl6PJ2F0
Concerted action from many EU and NATO allies has shown that an attack on one elicits a response from many, including the USA, Europe, Canada and Ukraine. If Russia continues to wage hybrid warfare on the West, the costs to Putin should increase further.
The steel trade dispute is a crisis, but it could be an opportunity. On @business I suggest the #EUCO leaders present a bolder option: offer deal-maker @realDonaldTrump a big free-trade bargain. https://t.co/SQGT8GYykl
Great to meet my good friend and @ALDEParty colleague Mark Rutte today in The Hague. His recent speech on EU reform is a must read: https://t.co/ZFkA543LA6 https://t.co/inpcK4HhRo
Great to catch up with @PavloKlimkin in Brussels. It’s time for the West to go beyond statements and start taking actions to defend ourselves from Russia’s hybrid warfare. We can start by providing more concrete support to #Ukraine. https://t.co/gVlFaaALJt
The democratic world’s fightback against Russia’s hybrid war on the West is long overdue. Britain can play a key role. My OpEd in @Telegraph today  https://t.co/cBSQW8ueMa

Great to be in Poland to discuss @ALDEParty 2019 manifesto.

Thanks @KLubnauer @Nowoczesna @EurLiberalForum   https://t.co/yAR0qZTt8R https://t.co/0JHsK6SLNV
Concerns about China’s trade and investment agenda are legitimate. But Europe and the USA must work together to defend the rules-based trade system. Triggering a transatlantic trade war would be a serious short-sighted mistake @realDonaldTrump
Great meeting with Senator @MarkWarner. Joining transatlantic forces to address Russia's meddling is critical. https://t.co/BVYiOQisBS
In recent days Gazprom has confirmed it is not a gas company but a platform for Russian coercion. How much more evidence do German politicians need to cancel Nord Stream 2?   https://t.co/kcaZirG4qJ
.@realDonaldTrump, a trade war will RISK American jobs. US steel-using industries employ 80 times more than the steel industry.   But it will also make all freedom-loving democracies poorer &amp; less free. If the US turns protectionist how long can Europe hold out? Last man standing https://t.co/yO78TJ48RX
The US has today authorised the sale of Javelin anti-tank defensive missiles to Ukraine. An important step that will help brave Ukrainians, like those I met on the contact line, to better defend themselves. https://t.co/ZMrhQeCYEB

Very good meeting with Romania’s defence minister Fifor, and caught up with good friend @JohnKerry https://t.co/GnDD6LkddJ
Agree with @theresa_may’s call for a security treaty, with pragmatism on both sides. But a treaty will take time to negotiate, and can only begin once the transition is agreed. The U.K. needs to set out its transition position in a matter of days to keep talks on track.

We must start work now on a UK-EU security deal. There's a WTO fall-back on trade, but not security.

#UNGA @poroshenko called for robust UN peacekeeping presence in #Donbas, with mandate to protect people across the region. Fully agree! https://t.co/SiTxRjo4xh
#UNGA @poroshenko is right to highlight that Russia, supposed guarantor of International security in UNSC is not a contributor, but a threat

Unclear if it's a serious proposal to save lives. Or Putin deflection tactic to legitimise Russian troops in Ukraine with blue helmets 3/4
Peacekeepers must cover the Ukr/Russia border not just the contact line. Protecting the OSCE is important but a wider mandate is needed 2/4

#Longgrayline has always stood firm. We must ensure #NATO's security longblueline stays firm too - protecting all Allies #transatlanticbond
For +60 yrs #American soldiers put their lives on the line to preserve security of entire #NATO #EuroAtlantic region #longgrayline
The security landscape has dramatically changed &amp; we have to adapt. At #NATOSummitWales we did exactly that
In #Europe a revanchist #Russia has rejected all the rules that have helped to keep peace since end of Cold War
In #Iraq #Syria we see rise of so-called #ISIS – a group of terrorists that have committed the most savage atrocities
We face security challenges that are more interconnected, more complex than ever before
#NATOSummitUK laid out way ahead for #Alliance – a fitter, faster &amp; more flexible #NATO
Pleased to be @WestPoint_USMA which has trained many exceptional leaders, commanders, including 12 #NATO SACEURS #longgrayline

At #NATOSummitWales we set out a clear course &amp; we need to pursue it urgently to reinforce rules-based int. order &amp; remain united
At this challenging time when our values and our will are being tested we must resist pressures to retrench &amp; remain resolute
We must strengthen our engagement in world security; stand up for our fundamental principles, values &amp; defend rules-based int. order
We must strengthen the global community of free societies devoted to democracy, rule of law, human rights, market economy
We must enhance our collective defence. #NATOSummitWales agreed on Readiness Plan to ensure firm, fast response to any threat
In this new age of unrest &amp; revisionism, #NATO &amp; the West must stand strong, united as force for freedom
I strongly condemn outrageous murders of US journalists &amp; British aid worker. #NATO allies stand united vs scourge of terrorism
To the South ISIS in #Iraq #Syria committing horrific atrocities. ISIS risks exporting terrorism to our nations,fuels sectarianism in region
To the East #Russia has rejected #NATO efforts to engage. Russia has trampled all rules, commitments that kept peace since end of Cold War
Speaking at @Carnegie_Europe about the arc of crises we’re facing. Keeping #NATO strong could not be more important
Wishing all participants of @InvictusLondon Games every success. We @NATO are inspired by your courage, proud of your achievements #IAM

Thank you @David_Cameron for hosting #NATOsummitUK. Thank you to the people of #Wales, thank you for your warm hospitality: Diolch yn fawr
Together, we’ve shaped #NATO of tomorrow. An Alliance that is ready, robust &amp; resolute. I’m proud to have led NATO through this pivotal time
We reaffirm our continuing and unwavering commitment to defend our populations, territory, sovereignty and shared values
#NATOsummitUK strengthens transatlantic bond enhancing security &amp; ensures a more fair and balanced sharing of costs &amp; responsibilities
Our vision of Europe whole, free &amp; at peace in danger w/ #Russia’s aggressive actions in #Ukraine &amp; violence &amp; extremism on southern borders
At #NATOsummitUK we took historic decisions which WILL keep #NATO strong: #ReadinessActionPlan, improved capabilities &amp; coop w/ partners
I’ve known @jensstoltenberg for many years and I wish him every success once he takes on this challenging role on 1 October
#NATOsummitUK took necessary decisions to prepare #FutureNATO.  It’s my great pleasure to present @jensstoltenberg who’ll lead #NATO there
We will open intensified &amp; focused talks on #Montenegro’s candidacy &amp; will assess by end of 2015 at the latest if we invite Montenegro
Today we agreed on a substantive package of measures for #Georgia that will help it advance in its preparations towards #NATO membership
We reaffirm readiness to provide security capacity support to #Libya when conditions permit. We stand ready to assist #Iraq, if requested
Building on close coop &amp; by their requests, we agreed to extend Defence Capacity Building Initiative to Georgia, Jordan, and Moldova
Defence Capacity Building Initiative: reinforce commitment to partners &amp; help #NATO project stability without deploying large combat forces
We’ll offer #NATO partners more opportunities to work &amp; train w/ us - to remain effective when we deploy &amp; tackle challenges together
From now on #cyber defence is a #NATO core task of collective defence as cyber attacks harm our societies as much as conventional attacks
#ReadinessActionPlan is not aimed against any country but is meant to defend #NATO countries. It’s fully in line w/ our int’l commitments
Decision is clear: #NATO protects all Allies at all times. Clear message to any potential aggressor: attack 1 Ally &amp; face all Allies
We agreed to create #spearhead within Response Force – a very high readiness force able to deploy at very short notice #NATOsummitUK
#ReadinessActionPlan will allow #NATO to be prepared to undertake full range of missions &amp; defend Allies against the full range of threats
#NATO just agreed on a #ReadinessActionPlan to strengthen our collective defence. A demonstration of solidarity &amp; resolve #NATOsummitUK
I welcome #Poland’s decision to host the next #NATO Summit. It’s a strong signal of Poland’s leadership in #NATO
Independent, sovereign &amp; stable #Ukraine, firmly committed to democracy &amp; rule of law, is key to Euro-Atlantic security. That’s #NATO’s goal
We established package of measures so #Ukraine can better provide for own security. Allies agreed to assist w/ up to 15m Euro through #NATO
#Ukraine has stood by NATO. Now in these difficult times, #NATO stands by Ukraine. #NATOsummitUK
#Ukraine has been important &amp; distinctive #NATO partner for many years. We highly value Ukraine’s contributions to our ops &amp; Response Force
1st time since end #WW2 that 1 European country tried to grab another’s territory by force. Rule of strongest can’t replace rule of law
While talking about peace, #Russia hasn’t made 1 single step to make peace possible.  Instead of de-escalating, #Russia only deepened crisis
#Russia is now fighting against #Ukraine, IN Ukraine. Russian troops &amp; tanks are attacking Ukrainian forces
Just had an important meeting w/ Pres @poroshenko on the grave crisis in #Ukraine. #NATOsummitUK
We urge the rest of the int’l community to stay engaged &amp; support Afghanistan’s future stability. This is in all our interests #NATOsummitUK
Today, #NATOsummitUK renewed our financial commitments to support the sustainment of the Afghan forces
We call on presidential candidates to deliver an outcome acceptable to #Afghan people &amp; conclude necessary security agreements #NATOsummitUK
W/o #Afghan signature, there can’t be a mission. Although our military commanders have shown great flexibility in planning, time is short
#NATO &amp; partners are ready to launch a train, advise &amp; assist mission in #Afghanistan once the required legal framework is in place
With the end of #ISAF in December, we’ll change the nature &amp; scope of our involvement in Afghanistan. But our commitment will endure
The courage of those who served in #Afghanistan, their effort &amp; sacrifice have made all our nations safer and improved global security
Today we paid tribute to all those who have served #NATO in the Armed Forces, our partners and the Afghan Security Forces. #NATOsummitUK
#Georgia carried out remarkable democratic &amp; defence reforms. #NATO urges Georgia to continue w/ reforms, uphold rule of law
As one of the largest non-#NATO troop contributor to #ISAF in #Afghanistan, #Georgia demonstrated itself as a security exporter
Tomorrow we’ll also launch initiative to strengthen coop w/ partners &amp; permanent capability to help partners strengthen their forces &amp; MoDs
Tomorrow we’ll launch a new coop package to help strengthen #Georgia’s defence, prepare for membership. #NATOsummitUK
Had a good meeting w/ @MargvelashviliG. At #NATOsummitUK we’ll strengthen ties w/ #NATO partners, incl #Georgia. Our coop goes a long way
I welcome individual allies support to stop so-called #IslamicState. If #Iraq would request #NATO support, we would consider that seriously
We welcome all genuine efforts to find peaceful solution to Crisis In #Ukraine. But what counts is what is happening on the ground
We’ll enhance coop w/ #Ukraine and other partners and open a new chapter in our partnership with #Afghanistan. #NATOsummitUK
#NATOsummitUK will take important steps to counter threats and strengthen defence of #NATO
At #NATOsummitUK we will also strengthen our partnerships, improve ability to work together to tackle commen challenges
#NATOsummitUK is also a key opportunity to reverse decline of defence budgets and share security responsibilities more equally across #NATO
#NATOsummitUK will adopt a Readiness Action Plan to make forces faster, fitter &amp; more flexible. Ready to address ANY challenge
#NATOsummitUK is a critical summit at a critical time. Today and tomorrow we will forge a stronger #NATO for a more complex, chaotic world
#NATO stood firm in face of Russian challenge by suspending co-op w/ #Russia, boosting co-op w/ #Ukraine &amp; strengthening collective defence
#Russia’s aggression against #Ukraine is a wake-up call. It reminds us that our freedom, security &amp; prosperity can’t be taken for granted
In good shape for #NATOSummitUK - 1 of most important in #NATO history. At the Future Leaders Summit now. #FutureNATO @YoungAtlantic
Just finalised preps for #NATOsummitUK w/ @David_Cameron. We're on track to take impt decisions to make #NATO faster, fitter &amp; more flexible

#NATO #ForMin have just discussed the situation in #Afghanistan where the people made their choice clear. They want democracy
Suspended co-op w/ #Russia in April, keeping diplomatic channels open. #NATO maintains susp until Russia back in line w/ int’l obligations
#ForMin agreed #NATO will provide support to partners more systematically &amp; swiftly by creating deployable pool of civ &amp; military experts

Absolutely shocking shootings at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims
#NATO’s  door is open. I call on all political leaders to promote democratic dialogue:  best guarantee of stable &amp; prosperous future
Integration into #NATO is a free choice, but requires continued reforms, tough decisions and courageous leadership
#NATO is committed to future of Western Balkans as a natural part of Euro-Atlantic family. Your security, stability &amp; future matters to us
Discussed w/ @GruevskiNikola excellent co-op. #NATO highly values contributions to #ISAF and support for #KFOR
The fact that PM @GruevskiNikola came to #NATO so recently, and my visit to Skopje show the importance we attach to our relationship
Just landed in Skopje. About to meet with PM @GruevskiNikola, MFA @NikolaPoposki
Leaving Podgorica after a busy day – next stop Skopje
#Russia must live up to its international commitments, especially as #Ukraine prepares important elections
Any meaningful, comprehensive and verifiable withdrawal would be a first step from #Russia into the right direction
Most of previously deployed Russian force remains near the Ukrainian border. We see continued Russian exercises
It is too early to say what this means, but I hope this is the start of a full and genuine withdrawal
We’ve seen limited #Russian troop activity vicinity of #Ukraine border that MAY suggest that some of these forces are preparing to withdraw
I encourage #Montenegro to continue efforts in reinforcing rule of law, security sector reforms &amp; fighting corruption &amp; organized crime
We’ve seen a lot of efforts, and a lot of achievements  in #Montenegro. But substantial reforms are still needed
#NATO’s door remains open to all European democracies willing &amp; able to assume responsibilities. But requires significant efforts &amp; reforms
#Montenegro has played a positive role in the Western Balkans and in contributing to international security in #Afghanistan
Just concluded good meeting with PM Đukanović. We discussed our important partnership and #Montenegro’s aspirations to join #NATO
Just landed in Podgorica, Montenegro, to meet Pres Vujanović, Speaker Krivokapic, PM Đukanović, MoD Pejanovic-Djurisic &amp; MFA Lukšić

#NATO is committed to the future of the Western Balkans. Your security, your stability and your future matter to us
#NATO is in close contact with the EU. We stand ready to help - the whole Euro-Atlantic family stands beside you in this difficult time
#NATO’s disaster response coordination centre received request for helicopters and boats. Allies and partners are responding to this crisis
Just met the #BiH Presidency. We discussed flood relief efforts. My thoughts are with the families and communities affected
Arrived in Sarajevo on a long-planned visit to meet pol leaders. I offer my sincerest condolences for the lives lost in the terrible floods
Rest assured we have all plans in place to ensure effective protection of all allies including the Baltic's and means to do it
We haven't seen any evidence of #Russian withdrawal of troops and I regret that
#NATO is based on solidarity: all for one, and one for all. NATO keeps every Ally safe. Every Ally must play full part in shared security
A credible defence &amp; deterrence need credible capabilities &amp; capabilities cost money. But our security is the foundation for our prosperity
6000 troops from across #NATO in significant exercise Steadfast Javelin in #Estonia. Good example of steps to bolster our forces &amp; readiness
We’ve taken immediate measures &amp; considering a readiness action plan to strengthen ability of our #NATO Response Force to respond quickly
We see a completely new security situation in Europe, less predictable &amp; more dangerous. This has implications now &amp; for the future
Ukraine’s presidential elex on May 25 in line w/ int’l law &amp; standards. This is the vote that counts for #Ukraine and the int’l community
We cannot take what we’ve achieved for granted. #Russia's aggression against #Ukraine has challenged right of states to chose own path
I’ve recently visited Allies in C-E Europe marking anniversaries of #NATO membership. Our shared goal: Europe whole, free &amp; at peace
Press conference today at 14.00 - I will focus on the crisis in #Ukraine and #Russia and #NATO’s readiness
Now more than ever, it's clear that defence matters. Strong bond between Europe &amp; N. America remains strong foundation for our security
We’ve strengthened presence in the air, on the ground &amp; at sea from the Black Sea to the Baltic. We'll continue to take all necessary steps
Discussed  #Ukraine crisis w/ President Băsescu and @Victor_Ponta. #Romania doesn’t stand alone as it’s part of #NATO
#Romania plays exceptional role in #Afghanistan active in multinat’ programmes to improve capabilities &amp; reversing decline in defence budget

#Ukraine crisis shows that defence matters &amp; that we have to invest in defence to preserve our security.  It’s not easy but it’s essential
#NATO’s core task is clear: defend &amp; protect Allies. We’ve already taken measures in the air, at sea and on the ground
#Russia aggression against #Ukraine undermines principles #NATO’s security &amp; prosperity was built on:  nations are free to make own choices

#Russia's aggression agst #Ukraine has raised understandable concerns. #NATO has taken immediate steps, won't hesitate to take further steps
I'm in #Estonia to congratulate you on 10 years of #NATO membership. Estonia is a staunch Ally &amp; a role model
Just landed in Tallinn. I will meet PM @TaaviRoivas and FM @Urmaspaet shortly
About to take off for #Estonia. Looking forward to meeting w/ Estonian leadership, to discuss #NATO collective, cyber defence
If we saw visible signs of a meaningful pullback by #Russia troops I'd be the first one to welcome it
I have very good vision but while we've noted #Russia’s statement so far we haven't seen any - any - indication of troops pulling back
Let me assure you that, as a member of #NATO, #Poland is safe. Anybody who would try to test Allied solidarity will fail
Crisis makes our work more urgent. We must strengthen #NATO capabilities, through stronger investment &amp; co-op. Sooner rather than later
Crisis in #Ukraine shows defence matters, that collective defence matters &amp; transatlantic co-op is best way to keep ourselves secure
#Poland knows it’s important #NATO shows solidarity, resolve, leadership to meet challenge of #Ukraine crisis. @premiertusk
Just discussed #Russia’s aggression against #Ukraine w/ @premiertusk.  #Poland knows importance of solidarity in the face of oppression
At #NATOSummitUK we’ll decide what steps we need to take to adjust our collective defence to new realities
#NATO’s response to #Russia’s actions is part of broad int’l efforts to de-escalate crisis and find a political solution
#Russia claims our actions are provocative accompanied by hostile rhetoric. This is not true and frankly, it’s absurd
#NATO stands together. Our commitment to collective defence is rock solid
Just had valuable discussion w/ #Poland President Komorowski on #Ukraine crisis &amp; implications for security in Europe and beyond
Good to be in #Poland as it celebrates 15yrs of #NATO membership. We are grateful for Polish contributions, support to Alliance
#Russia should live up to its intl commitments, stop separatist support &amp; scale back troops from #Ukraine border, seek political solutions
We haven't seen any signs that #Russia is withdrawing its troops from #Ukraine's borders
#NATO sent #Russia unmistakable message: your behaviour doesn’t belong in 21st century &amp; your rhetoric draws on outdated clichés of Cold War
Allied ships, planes, exercises show vigilance &amp; resolve from Baltic to the Black Sea. We’ll keep reinforcing #NATO security
Landed in Warsaw. About to meet @sikorskiradek &amp; @TomaszSiemoniak. My clear message: #NATO will defend every part of Allied territory
#Ukraine crisis has changed Europe’s security landscape. #NATO is responding
On my way to #Poland for a timely visit. Looking forward to meeting President Komorowski, @premiertusk, @sikorskiradek , @TomaszSiemoniak
I praise #Japan for determination to contribute to international efforts towards global peace and stability
#Russia’s actions created gravest crisis since Cold War, so dialogue w/ partners like #Japan key to deal w/ global security challenges
#NATO-#Japan partnership is based upon shared values, shared commitment to int’l peace &amp; security&amp; the principles of @UN and int’l law
#NATO is grateful for vital #Japan assistance for #Afghanistan over last 10yrs &amp; welcomes Japan’s intention to continue support beyond 2014
#Japan’s PM Abe and I signed agreement bringing practical co-op to new level incl. counter piracy, disaster relief, humanitarian assistance
Had a very good meeting w/ #Japan’s PM Abe at #NATO Council. Shows how highly we value our partnership
My statement on further #NATO measures to strengthen collective defence in wake of #Ukraine crisis: http://t.co/jaGO3JgogP
We are discussing a package of measures providing all allies with the security they need, in the air, at sea, and on land
#Russia’s aggression against #Ukraine shows that we cannot take our security for granted
#NATO keeps us all secure. We should all invest to keep NATO strong. Financially &amp; politically in building strong &amp; effective partnerships
#Luxembourg contributes in #Kosovo and #Afghanistan and supports projects to develop cutting-edge capabilities such as surveillance drones
Just had an important meeting with PM @Xavier_Bettel in #Luxembourg - steadfast member of NATO since the start
I would like to see greater readiness, and greater coordination - for example between the #NATO Response Force and the #EU Battlegroups
Crisis is a wake-up call for all in Europe. We can no longer take security for granted. We have to invest in it, if we want to preserve it
#Russia should stop being part of the problem, and start being part of the solution
Deeply concerned by sit in Ukraine. Continued violence by small groups of separatists &amp; #Russia’s military pressure on #Ukraine’s border
Read my statement on Ukraine: http://t.co/0pQ5Pg1AVN
Steps are entirely in line with our international commitments &amp; agreements w/ #Russia which Russia itself continues to blatantly breach
#NATO has taken legitimate steps to reinforce our support to Allies from the Baltic to the Black Sea
#NATO’s core task is collective defence and our commitment to collective defence is unwavering
We see a grave challenge to the values and the principles that we uphold and that underpin Euro-Atlantic security #Ukraine
I thank #Bulgaria for significant contribution to #NATO as we mark the 10th anniversary of accession to #NATO

#NATO is taking legitimate steps to deal w/ instability created by #Russia in line w/ @NATO’s fundamental purpose
#Russia: take concrete steps to regain trust of int'l community. Pull back troops. Enter sincere dialogue respecting #Ukraine's sovereignty
#Russia's attempts to draw new dividing lines, limit sovereignty of Ukraine &amp; recreate new sphere of influence run contrary to int’l norms
#Bulgaria Pres Plevneliev &amp; I agree: vision of Europe whole, free &amp; at peace called into question by #Russia’s aggression against #Ukraine
Just had warm &amp; fruitful meeting w/ Bulgarian President Plevneliev
Very honored to receive St George Order at MoD. Stands for courage of the Bulgarian forces, demonstrated in #NATO operations

New video blog: “Call on #Russia to step back” http://t.co/TFjDdQsovS
#NATO’s commitment to collective defence unwavering. We r taking legitimate steps to deal w/instability created by #Russia's illegit acts
If #Russia is serious about a dialogue, the first step should be to pull back its troops
40,000 Russian troops along #Ukraine’s borders, not training, ready for combat. #Russia is stirring tensions &amp; provoking unrest in E Ukraine
#Russia's propaganda:designed to subvert Ukrainian govt, pervert truth &amp; divert attention from #Russia’s illegal/illegitimate actions
#Russia trying to justify its actions by accusing #Ukraine of oppressing Russian speakers &amp; #NATO of a Cold War mentality. Pure propaganda
1st time since countries like #Czech Republic won freedom that one state is trying to grab part of another’s territory at gunpoint
I discussed #Russia’s illegal aggression against #Ukraine with Czech PM Sobotka
I just arrived in Prague, a city which knows importance of standing up for freedom, resisting illegal aggression, and living in truth

In #NATO-#Russia Founding Act, Russia pledged to respect territorial integrity, sovgnty &amp; pol. independence of others. Now in blatant breach

#Russia is violating every principle &amp; int'l commitment, 1st &amp; foremost commitment not to invade other countries
I'm surprised that #Russia FM Lavrov claims #NATO has violated its agreement w/ Russia. This is just propaganda &amp; disinformation
#Estonia, like every @NATO member can count on Allied solidarity at all times &amp; against any threat
Despite economic crisis, #Estonia is spending 2% of GDP on defence. If Estonia can do it, other #NATO Allies can do it
#Estonia learnt tough lessons on #cyber defence &amp; is now making a significant contribution to strengthen #NATO efforts in this vital domain
Over the years, brave and professional #Estonia troops have made a substantial contribution to #NATO challenging mission in #Afghanistan

Vision agreed in 2010 in #Lisbon remains right one: true strategic #NATO &amp; #Russia partnership. But on key areas, still too far apart #MSC50
Facing clear #NATO-#Russia relations choice: accept cold co-op OR aim 4 constr. engagement &amp; move forward twrds strategic partnship. #MSC50
Of all NATO’s partner relations, no partnership holds greater potential than #NATO-#Russia relations – but potential not fully met. #MSC50

#NATO partnerships helped build a Europe whole and free, and fostered peace and security in our neighbourhood. #ForMin
At #NATOSummitUK we must strengthen our engagement with partners, which will be increasingly important to our success. #ForMin
We’ll meet MFA Panjikidze at #NATO-#Georgia Commission to enhance co-op after successful elections. @MFAgovge #ForMin
At #NATO-#Russia Council I expect initiation of project on destruction of old &amp; dangerous ammunition in Kaliningrad. #ForMin
It’s my firm hope &amp; intention to continue our efforts to support #Afghanistan, once these agreements are concluded
Legal framework must be in place for #NATO-led post-2014 #Afghanistan mission. If not: no deployment &amp; planned assistance at risk. #ForMin

Just had constructive talks with @OSCE SG Ambassador Zannier on #Afghanistan, #Kosovo http://t.co/wM6DTflb8p
I offer my sincere condolences to the victims, the families affected by the tragedy in #Riga, #Latvia. My thoughts are with you
Europe needs to be smart: coordinate, not duplicate. Cooperate, not compete. Complement, rather than waste money, resources and efforts
Europe needs to develop capabilities not bureaucracies, to invest in security in those areas where we all need more capabilities
#EU needs to show political will: invest in defence to defend our interests &amp; values. And so Europe can be strong partner for N. America
Next month the #EU will hold its first summit on defence &amp; security issues since Lisbon Treaty: an important opportunity for Europeans
On my way to participate in #EU defence ministerial, important step towards EU defence summit in December
Just had a meeting w/ Swedish DefMin Karin Enström on very valued #NATO- #Sweden partnership http://t.co/pYLf7Z1hOU

Great meeting with old friend @premiertusk on #SteadfastJazz, defence investment, #EU/#NATO http://t.co/E9Fgte6SoW
#SteadfastJazz is also about building security together w/ valued @NATO partners: #Finland, #Sweden, #Ukraine
Connected Forces Initiative goes beyond #NATO: just as important to work w/ partners - countries which share commitment to security
#SteadfastJazz: an important test for our future capabilities to keep our forces strong &amp; connected
We have seen ground troops, ships and planes in action. Key capabilities that #NATO can call on to defend any Ally. #SteadfastJazz
Would like to thank @prezydentpl Komorowski, and the people of #Poland for their strong commitment to @NATO
With Andris Bērziņš, Pres of #Latvia on our way to #Poland for the live exercise of #SteadfastJazz http://t.co/O4C1EJryAG
Great pleasure to be back in #Poland. Many thanks to Poland for hosting #SteadfastJazz together w/ #Latvia
#NATOSummitUK will shape @NATO of the future: Alliance equipped to deal with the full range of modern threats, engaged w/ partners
#Latvia making valuable contribs #SmartDef though multinational projects like Alliance Ground Surveillance. #NATO #AGS
#Latvia is a strong &amp; reliable #NATO member. Latvian troops are making an important contribution to #Afghanistan‘s stability. @VDombrovskis
#SteadfastJazz: making sure that the @NATO Response Force remains able to defend any Ally and deal with any threat - all at short notice
Thank you to #Latvia PM @VDombrovskis &amp; #Poland for hosting #SteadfastJazz, #NATO’s most significant exercise in nearly a decade
I don't expect #Russia to have any intention to attack #NATO Allies, so #SteadfastJazz is a signal "to whom it may concern"
Press asks is #SteadfastJazz against #Russia? It's a signal of determination to defend our #NATO allies
I really admire the determination of the Latvian people and their strong commitment to Euro-Atlantic security
I'm very honoured to have received the Latvian Cross of Recognition. http://t.co/Bb3BxPCI44
Just arrived in #Latvia. Looking forward to seeing @NATO’s Response Force in action during #SteadfastJazz exercise
#SteadfastJazz tests @NATO’s Response Force: Over 6000 troops from across #NATO and several partners working as single, seamless team
Commanding complex multinational forces at short notice is vital part of NATO’s overall capabilities. #SteadfastJazz
The air, sea and land HQs commanding different parts of NATO Response Force have already been tested. #SteadfastJazz is final test together
In 2 days I will travel w/ all #NATO ambassadors to #Latvia &amp; #Poland, to observe #SteadfastJazz
#Kosovo elections important element in normalisation Belgrade &amp; Pristina relations. @NATO will remain vigilant at this key moment
#KFOR deployed quick reaction force on @EULEXKosovo request to ensure free movement of election ballot material to counting centre
I strongly condemn attacks on polling stations in north Mitrovica #Kosovo. Violence &amp; intimidation cannot be tolerated
I welcome @No10gov announcement: #NATOSummitUK 2014 will be in South Wales. Looking forward to a successful summit next year. #Cymru2014
#DefMin reviewed #UNSC Res 1325 implementation &amp; related resolutions. Important to us all, as made clear at Chicago #NATOSummit last year
#DefMin discussed #Afghanistan elections. Expect elections to be held on time &amp; to be transparent/inclusive/credible
We still have work to do including agreeing legal framework w/ Afghan government on the status of our forces. #DefMin #Afghanistan
We are moving ahead in our planning for a mission to train, advise and assist #Afghanistan forces after 2014. #DefMin
#NATO #DefMin had good discussion on #Afghanistan w/ Defence Minister Mohammadi and our #ISAF partners
No secret #NATO-#Russia hasn’t found way to co-op on #MissileDefence, but #DefMin discussions are valuable in addressing existing concerns
#NATO-#Russia Council discussed military exercise transparency. Vital that exercises are conducted w/ maximum transparency. #DefMin
I see untapped potential in #NATO-#Russia Council. #DefMin also discussed disposal excess/unsafe ammunition in Russia. #DefMin
#NATO-#Russia continue to cooperate on #Afghanistan to build security and stability in the region. #DefMin
We now have proven joint capacity to respond to hijacking of civilian aircraft. This showed effectiveness of #NATO-#Russia Council. #DefMin
Last month pilots conducted a flight exercise over #Poland, #Russia and #Turkey under @NATO-Russia Council Cooperative. #DefMin
#NATO-#Russia also step forward w/ real-life condition testing STANDEX project: detecting explosives in public spaces. #DefMin
#DefMin condemned terrorist attack on a bus in #Volgograd. We expressed our condolences to the victims, their families &amp; loved ones
#DefMin just had productive #NATO-#Russia Council. We’re doing more together than ever before. Counter-#terrorism is centre-piece of co-op
We agree #NATO can &amp; should facilitate #cyber defence efforts. Eg by sharing expertise/info amongst Allies. #DefMin
On #cyber defence #NATO’s first priority is, of course, to defend our own networks. #DefMin
#NATO’s experts will now work on #CFI as a matter of priority, ahead of #NATOSummit 2014 in the #UK. #NATO2014. #DefMin
#CFI is key in reaching goal of #NATO Forces 2020: modern, tightly connected, equipped, trained, exercised, and commanded. #DefMin
#NATO #DefMin finished two very productive meetings. We have taken a significant step forward in our Connected Forces Initiative #CFI
Great meeting w/ #SecDef Hagel on #NATO agenda for the future: #cyber, missile defence, #Afghanistan. #NATOSummit #NATO2014
Good meeting w/ Albania FM Mimi Kodhili before #NATO #DefMin. She handed me a painting by PM Rama which I’ll treasure http://t.co/DLTuRyzh30
#NATO agreed to respond positively to Libya’s request for defence institution building advice. We’ll set up a small advisory team. #DefMin
At #DefMin we set about delivering goal of #NATO Forces 2020 &amp; an Alliance that is ready &amp; able to address twenty-first century challenges
With #DefMin we will take our agenda forward as we prepare #NATOSummit 2014 in the #UK. #NATO2014
#NATO values #Montenegro’s active contrib. to co-op and security in W. Balkans. NATO remains fully committed to the region
#NATO is grateful for #Montenegro’s significant contrib. to #ISAF and pledging to support new mission in #Afghanistan after 2014
I encourage #Montenegro to continue working on reinforcing rule of law, fighting corruption, finding resources to modernise armed forces

New video blog “Defence Matters” - http://t.co/MlEANWA6eD #NATO
If we want to continue to reap security benefits, we need to continue to invest:  politically, militarily &amp; financially in defence &amp; #NATO
What’s the cost of NO defence? Billions – eg piracy &amp; terrorism. But financial cost nothing compared to human cost #NATO
4- Europeans and N.Americans generally value #NATO. Increasing number of N.Americans question return of investment in our Alliance #NATO
3- Defence industries viewed as positive contributors to economy, but coloured by perceptions of wasteful spending, transparency lack #NATO
2- Public understands freedom &amp; prosperity depends on security. No understanding: how we invest, use of investments &amp; role of forces #NATO
1- wide-spread respect for forces/broad support for def. investment. Majority believes we should maintain or increase defence spending #NATO
#NATO worked w/ prominent research institutes from 8 #NATO members talking to civ. Reps and public opinion polls– 4 findings stand out:
Financial crisis led to defence cuts in many #NATO countries &amp; raised question: how much does our defence really matter #NATO
#NATOSummit 2014 will shape future #NATO: deal w/ modern threats, engage w/ partners, based on peace, freedom &amp; Euro-Atlantic bond
#Croatia shares experience &amp; expertise with other W. Balkan nations to help them move closer to @NATO
Giving a press conference w/ President @ivojosipovic. #Croatia understands the value of security and co-op
#NATO's door remains open but aspirant W. Balkan countries need to make efforts/reforms walk in. #Croatia can play exemplary role
I told FM @vpusic #Croatia has set an example for Western Balkans region. #NATO's door remains open
I just met #Croatia’s FM @vpusic on margins NPA. We had interesting exchange on Western Balkans and #Afghanistan
Security is the basis of our prosperity, the foundation of our future. It’s the best guarantee of our freedom and way of life #NATO
#NATO Parliamentary Assembly meets in Dubrovnik today to discuss importance of sufficient investment in defence &amp; security
I thanked Josip Leko, Speaker of #Croatia’s Parliament for his countries strong &amp; consistent support to #NATO
Congratulations to @OPCW for winning #NobelPeacePrize! OPCW doing difficult but essential work in eliminating #WMD #CW in #Syria
#NATOSummit 2014: reaffirm transatlantic bond, enhance partnerships, review #Afghanistan progress and prepare post-2014 mission
Pleasure to meet PM @samaras_antonis. #Greece will play full role in #NATOSummit 2014 in #UK
We must work together: developing modern military capabilities, training, consulting. And be determined to stay ahead of threats #NATO

#NATO #DefMin later this month will chart path towards #NATOSummit 2014 shaping future NATO
Just had very good meeting w/ DefMin Avramopoulo on #Greece’s valuable contributions to @NATO ops
The international community has responsibility to help #Libya build its security sector in response to the country's request

Defence #EuCo in Dec. opport. to create stronger #Europe. #Greece as next #EU presidency: major role turning commitments into capabilities
Best way to deal w/ increasing security threats w/ defence budgets under pressure is cooperation. #NATO
I thanked #Greece FM @EVenizelos for enduring @NATO support despite tough economic choices
Just landed in #Greece. Meetings with president Papoulias, PM @samaras_antonis, DefMin Avramopoulo and FM @EVenizelos

Upcoming #Afghan elections will be fully Afghan-led &amp; managed. It will be the most advanced election in modern Afghan history. #SGMonthly
Changes in #Afghanistan are remarkable. Investments in lives/resources are unprecedented. Nobody can deny that &amp; effort should be respected
Thanks to immense #ISAF efforts and troops/civilian sacrifices, #Afghanistan has come a long way in the past decade. #SGMonthly
#NATOSummit 2014 will be an opportunity to review progress made in #Afghanistan
#NATO warmly welcomes #UK hosting #NATOSummit 2014. Opportunity to look at future NATO. #SGMonthly
If It’s confirmed that #Libya PM Zeidan has been abducted, I call for PMs immediate release. Stability&amp; rule of law are critically important
It’s important that the situation in #Libya is clarified as soon as possible
I’m following developments in #Libya very closely &amp; w/ great concern

We’re looking @ request to advise in development of #Libya security forces. Think others in region can benefit from #NATO expertise too
Projecting stability without need to project forces - that’s good for our #NATO partners &amp; its good for our Allies too. @Carnegie_Europe
NATO should explre ways 2 help nations like #Libya build security capacity. #NATO = unique expertise/experience. @Carnegie_Europe #AskAnders
I expect December #EUCO on security/defence to demonstrate strong political commitment. Its opportunity not to be missed. @Carnegie_Europe
Strong Europe requires strong political will, increased defence spending, longterm investment progs &amp; assume more security responsibilities
Euro Allies need more drones 4 surveillance, more large transport &amp; air2air refuelling aircraft &amp; more upgraded radars on ships for #BMD
To be frank, some of the capabilities we have, we don't need. And some of the capabilities we need, we don't have
A strong #NATO needs a strong Europe w/ strong capabilities, strong defence industries &amp; strong political commitment #EU
3 prtys to ensure #NATO is ready for next challenge: robust defence/deterrence, reaffirm transatlantic bond, bolster global partnerships
#NATO Allies form unique community of values. We must ensure we have military capabilities to protect those values &amp; political will to do so
In world of transition &amp; often turbulent times so we need something strong, stable, secure - that pillar of strength is #NATO
LIVE NOW -  Addressing #NATO’s future: how to keep it Ready, Robust, Rebalanced. @Carnegie_Europe #defence #EU http://t.co/btKdKfymti

I’m confident #NATO &amp; #Kyrgyzstan can be more ambitious in co-op in disaster response, logistics &amp; defence reform. NATO is ready to assist
Challenges remain in #Afghanistan e.g. drug-flow. That’s why #NATO helps provide counter-narcotic training for Afghanistan &amp; region
#Kyrgyzstan helps building security in #Afghanistan by facilitating equipment transit. By end 2014, Afgh. security will have Afghan face
I encourage Pres Atambayev to strengthen democratic institutions &amp; ensure protection of minorities and human rights in #Kyrgyzstan
#NATO #Kyrgyzstan partnership based on shared values &amp; democratic principles. It’s the essence of Partnership for Peace
I welcomed President Almazbek Atambayev on his first visit to #NATO HQ. #Kyrgyzstan is a valued partner, committed to dialogue and co-op
At time of tough economic decisions, #NATO nations we need to work even more closely together to get needed capabilities. #SmartDefence
Discussed preparation for non-combat mission in #Afghanistan w/ @ediramaal to train, assist and advice Afghan forces
#Albania's co-op w/ neighbours is valuable contribution to security. This is a time to build for the future, not look at the past
#Albania makes valuable contributions to #NATO operations in #Kosovo and #Afghanistan. @ediramaal
Welcomed #Albania PM @ediramaal to #NATO. The fact that he came at start of his mandate shows personal commitment to Alliance
Important de poursuivre initiatives pour la stabilité politique/sécuritaire de la Somalie. Causes de la piraterie : pas en mer mais à terre
We agree on importance of efforts to stabilise #Somalia from political/security perspective. Roots of piracy are not on sea, but on land
On examine de nouvelles opportunités de co-op. On se rapproche d'un accord sur l'ouverture  bureau de liaison de l'#OTAN à #Djibouti
#NATO &amp; #Djibouti to explore further co-op. We’re moving closer to agreement on opening a NATO liaison office in Djibouti
+1 an: 0 actes de piraterie réussie montre l'efficacité co-op intl. Mais on ne peut pas se permettre de baisser la garde 
Zero successful pirate attacks over a year show effective international co-op. We agree we can’t afford to be complacent
J'ai salué le président Ismaïl Omar Guelleh de #Djibouti à #OTAN. Djibouti: grand contributeur à la réduction de la menace de la piraterie

"Fulfilling Europe's potential" Read my speech on #NATO-#EU: http://t.co/whBMxjxWs9
#EuCo needs to make strategic choice in December. We should build capabilities, not bureaucracies and do it together
Our security isn’t optional. It’s vital. Europeans need to invest in strong #Europe and strong partnership bwtn @NATO and #EU
If we Europeans want to tackle the challenges we’ll face in the future, we must raise the level of our ambition. #EU
Over the last 4yrs, most European Allies have reduced defence spending. Some by more than 20% – the emerging world is increasing quickly
Speaking as proud European: If we don’t invest enough in defence &amp; security we will not speak of our influence but of others over our world
Addressing inter-parlmntry conference on common foreign and security policy in #Lithuania  on how to fulfil Europe’s potential. #NATO #EU
Just took part in an excellent discussion at #EU #DefMin. Strong support for EU-NATO cooperation, not duplication ahead of December #euco
To media at #EU defmin on #Syria #CW: Not to act would also be to act. Not to act would send dangerous signal to dictators they can use WMD

Landed in #Lithuania  to attend #EU Defence Ministerial &amp; open @NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence w/ @Grybauskaite_LT
December #EC will address defence &amp; security. In our unpredictable world, it’s an opportunity not to be missed
At  #EU #DefMin in #Lithuania this week I’ll address defence co-op between #NATO &amp; EU. Strong Europe = strong NATO
#Syria demonstrates we continue to face significant security challenges and it’s vital we’re prepared to meet them
I fully support decisions of individual allies. #NATO is alliance of democracies. Democracy doesn’t weaken us but is source of our strength
#NATO plays its part. Close consultations w/ Allies continues. We continue to protect #Turkey &amp; south-eastern border
There’s a reason why #CW are banned across civilized world. These horrific &amp; barbaric arms have no place in 21st century
#NATO’s position on #Syria is clear. #CW attacks that claimed lives of 100s of men, women &amp; children cannot be ignored
Press conf at 14 CET - I intend to speak about #Syria and also European defence. Follow live: http://t.co/1FykJTZFzY
Always looked forward to interviews with  #davidfrost - tough questions, with a smile. My thoughts are with his family
Watch my statement on #Syria #CW here http://t.co/xVBCUKdN8i
#NATO Allies will continue to consult/ keep situation in #Syria under close review/ continue to assist #Turkey
#NATO Allies consider use of #CW in #Syria as threat to regional, intl peace &amp; security
#Syria #CW: clear breach of intl norms &amp; practice. Unacceptable &amp; cannot go unanswered. Those responsible must be held accountable
#NATO Allies fully support #UN #CW investigation &amp; deplore that #Syria regime failed to provide immediate &amp; secure access
#NATO Allies discussed #Syria, condemn in strongest possible terms outrageous #CW attacks around Damascus
#Egypt an imp't #NATO Mediterranean Dialogue partner. All sides shd refrain frm violence, restore political process
I’m deeply concerned by situation in #Egypt, continuing reports of bloodshed. I deplore the loss of life

Just addressed nearly 2000 at historic Afgh milestone ceremony: Afghan &amp; #ISAF troops, cadets, officials, MPs, diplomats. Moving ceremony
Proud 2be in #Afghanistan on proud day for Afghans. Important milestone security transition. #Karzai announced Afghan forces will take lead
#NATO #Patriots will ensure effective protection of #Turkey against any #Syria missile attack, chemical or not
I welcome clear #US statement. Urgent that #Syria regime should let #UN investigate all reports of chemical weapons use
Responded to journalist on #US statement: int. community made clear: use #Syria chemical weapons completely unacceptable, breach of int. law
EU summit in December should deliver a strong #Europe. What we don't need are more bureaucracies. What we need are more capabilities. #EUCO
#Europe has to be clear about what it wants. Do we want to act? Or do we want to watch?
Economic difficulties are forcing European #NATO members to cut in defence. #Europe risks to become a simple spectator on global stage
#Europe should have confidence, conviction, #capabilities to play its part in shaping 21st century, #Poland can help show the way
I thank Polish soldiers, serving w/ courage in @NATO operation in #Afghanistan and #Kosovo, making #Poland, #Europe and Allies safer
#Poland plays key role in #NATO missile defence. System on track. No change in coverage for NATO Europe against a growing threat.
I expressed the hope #Poland will be able to contribute to future NATO mission to train Afghan forces post-2014
I thanked ForMin Sikorski and DefMin Simoniak for #Poland 's strong commitment to NATO, and significant contribution to operations.
My latest video blog: #Poland - a staunch Ally http://t.co/cuN0LE6VLe

#NATO encourages #Georgia to continue w/ reforms and have free &amp; fair presidential elections in 2014. #DefMin
#NATO #DefMin made clear they are ready to support and assist #Georgia as it moves ahead w/ reforms
At #NATO/#Georgia meeting, #DefMin expressed appreciation to Georgia for support to #ISAF + future #ResoluteSupport mission
#ResoluteSupport will focus on national institutions: eg security ministries and corps level of army and police in #Afghanistan. #DefMin
#ResoluteSupport mission based on limited regional approach in Kabul and N, W, S &amp; E #Afghanistan. #DefMin
Endorsed #ResoluteSupport concept non-combat mission #Afghanistan to guide military planners in next months. #NATO #DefMin
We are planning a new mission in Afghanistan to train/advise/assist Afghan forces called #ResoluteSupport #NATO #DefMin
2014 will mark end of #ISAF combat mission in #Afghanistan, but it’s also a new beginning. #DefMin
#Afghanistan security transition advanced. Progress clear to see. Still challenges ahead, much work to do. #DefMin
I expect we’ll endorse Concept of Operations of new mission in #Afghanistan and then initiate detailed work Operations Plan. #DefMin
#NATO &amp; partners have been planning new train/advice/assist #Afghanistan mission. Non-combat and smaller than current mission. #DefMin
Important milestone in #Afghanistan in few weeks w/ Afghan taking lead for security across country. #ISAF shifts to support role. #DefMin
Some European nations increasing spending despite crisis. #DefMin expressed interest in multinational projects to fill gaps. #SmartDef
Defence budget falling while cost capabilities rise. Imbalance in burdens carried by Allies. #NATO #DefMin
#DefMin agreed that we will discuss how to support and assist Allies under #cyber attack in October on basis of detailed report
Cyber attacks get more common, complex &amp; dangerous. We agreed how #NATO can move forward on #cyber defence. #DefMin
We must consider what #NATO can do to help nations requesting assistance in case of #cyber attacks. #DefMin
Increased multinational cooperation using limited resources more efficiently/effectively is #SmartDef. #DefMin
Defence should not take disproportionate share in cuts. Not investing in capabilities can put mil capacity/pol credibility at risk. #DefMin
#NATO’s purpose: defend &amp; protect our territory and populations. Need right capabilities to do the job. Must fill in the gaps. #DefMin
#NATO experts to report on finding of #Libya request by end June. @NATO will then decide on way ahead. #DefMin
#Libya requested #NATO security advice. Allies decided to send experts to learn details of request/identify areas we can add value. #DefMin
#DefMin will have first dedicated discussion on #cyber. We protect our own networks, I believe we can do more to assist #NATO allies
#NATO #DefMin will discuss #capabilities needed for challenges we face and looking at shortfalls and imbalances

My latest video blog: #NATO 's door remains open http://t.co/uw6CB7mO4U
We will keep #NATO 's door open, but countries aspiring to membership must also keep up their reforms

On my way to Bucharest University where I'll give a speech on why #NATO 's door should remain open
#Romania is active participant in #NATO #SmartDefence projects, ensuring security at a price we can afford
I’m in #Romania, a committed #NATO ally. Determination &amp; dedication of Romanian forces is displayed daily in #Afghanistan/#Kosovo

Our thoughts at this terrible time are with the victim's family and friends. #Woolwich
I strongly condemn the #Woolwich attack. A shocking and barbaric crime. Such attacks can never be justified.
My speech “#Afghanistan – worth the cost” at #NATO Parliamentary Assembly is online: http://t.co/II9VdM7OMT
With #Luxembourg PM Juncker http://t.co/c8XeMHHOEe
Sacrifices made by our brave troops in #Afghanistan have not been in vain. They made Afghanistan more secure and #NATO stronger
Security transition in #Afghanistan well advanced, but continued progress on economic, political transition key to sustaining gains
#UN report shows #Afghanistan achieved fastest growth in S Asia in health, education, living standards
With our support #Afghanistan has come long way. Different country from what it was during dark days of #Taliban
#Afghanistan forces have lead security for 87% of population and lead 95% of operations. Afghans getting stronger, and ready for more
In 2001 #Afghanistan was used as launching pad for #terrorism. That launching pad is no more. Threat to our nations is reduced
Addressing #NATO Parliamentary Assembly: were efforts in #Afghanistan worth the cost? Short answer: yes. Long answer: absolutely yes!
About to get to #Luxembourg to give speech on #Afghanistan at #NATO Parliamentary Assembly and meet PM Juncker
Congratulations on democratic elections to ppl of #Pakistan, an important partner for #NATO http://t.co/EejVQWfG3f

VIDEO BLOG from Oslo:  Liberation Day in #Norway -   http://t.co/4Ge9yIXvlN
Urge int. comm.: find political solution. Concerned regional spill over &amp; use of chemical weapons. Stressed need for unified UNSC. #Syria
Stressed that @NATO has no plans to intervene in #Syria. Our focus - to defend #Turkey. Right way forward is political solution
Discussed how to maintain operational capabilities learned in ops. Glad to receive #Norway support on Connected forces Initiative #CFI
Discussed challenges ahead: #Cyber, #Missiledefence. At this time of austerity we must spend our resources better. #SmartDefence
All in all #Norway is a staunch ally with firm contributions to our #NATO alliance

Just landed in Bodø, Norway w/ the 28 #NATO ambassadors. Tomorrow I’ll attend the Annual National Conference on Europe
December #EUCO should show Europe able &amp; willing to act &amp; encourage #EU/#NATO to do more together. See my remarks at http://t.co/fQB5sRnN9p
Without hard capabilities to back up diplomacy, #Europe will lack credibility and influence on the global stage
If #EU nations don’t firmly commit to security/defence, all talk about strengthened European defence/security policy will be just be hot air
Speaking at #EP: I’m fully committed to a strong, open Europe. Pleased that there will be #EUCO on security and defence in December
#NATO’s cmit to support impt #Kosovo agreement remains key for success. Hope it will soon translate into further improvements on the ground
Europe’s security depends on efforts of #NATO &amp; #EU. We can only be effective if we coordinate efforts, as we do in #Kosovo
Press conf. now, before going to #EP. 1 of my priorities: strengthen #NATO #EU coop. Europe to be powerful global actor not global spectator
Visited #USCYBERCOM, extremely valuable insights from gen Alexander &amp; team. No border to #Cyber threats. Must be prepared to deal w/ them

We must invest sufficiently in defence. If we cant protect against cyber, piracy, energy cut-offs, terrorist attacks, it will cost billions
There is growing transatlantic gap in defence spending. We cant take US engagement in Europe for granted, we have to address burdensharing

#Afghanistan forces can do the job. We must make sure they can keep on doing it: training, leadership, skills
During recent #Afghan visit to Helmand I saw a significant shift. Afghans conducting nearly all security operations. ISAF: training,advising
Women play key role in #Afghanistan, #NATO ops. I met inspiring, determined young women leaders in Kabul. Shaping their country’s future

At the security conference in Munich to take part in panel on Building a Euro-Atlantic Security Community #MSC
We are delivering on commitments and learning lessons from our operations
Way ahead for Alliance Ground Surveillance system as agreed in Lisbon. Libya operation showed its importance.
We need to maintain current presence in #Kosovo - will reduce it only when time is right. @ KFOR_Kosovo
2011 challenging for #KFOR in #Kosovo, but our troops acted firmly, carefully and impartially in accordance with UN mandate
Transition in #Afghanistan in close coordination between #NATO/partners/Afghan authorities leading to Afghans in charge of security
Goal for #Afghanistan: full Afghan responsibility for security by end 2014. Goal stands for every single one of us.
At the #NATO summit in Chicago we will take decisions on how to implement transition form that point until the end of 2014
Shift in ISAF presence/role during transition will take place in close consultation/coordination ISAF Allies/partners/Afghan authorities
#ISAF’s role will gradually change from combat to support based on security and realities with combat ops during transition period
Transition started last year and will continue. Expect Afghan Forces to have taken full responsibility by end of 2014
In Lisbon we outlined roadmap for gradual transition security responsibility to Afghan security forces. Decision and roadmap still stand
Expect start transition last group #Afghan districts and provinces mid-2013. Complete transition to full security responsibility by end 2014
#NATO decisions in Lisbon remain bedrock of our strategy in #Afghanistan. Alliance will stick to agreed Lisbon target
#Nato defence ministers will discuss transition in #Afghanistan and future capabilities

New video blog: "Baltic Allies: Real Security Providers" - http://t.co/592JndRK #NATO
I am pleased that Baltics are supporters of the #SmartDefence: ensuring better spending to get the capabilities we need. #NATO #Summit2012
Innovation will be at the heart of how #NATO tackles security challenges in today’s difficult economic environment
We have same goal: an #Afghanistan responsible for own security. We all remain committed to helping Afghans achieve that goal. @ISAFmedia
Incidents like today terrible but isolated. 130000 ISAF troops from 50 nations fight and train with +300000 Afghans. @ISAFmedia
I express my condolences to the families of the 4 French soldiers and to the French people. All my sympathy to the wounded. #Afghanistan
A very sad day for our troops in #Afghanistan. I pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of all our soldiers in Afghanistan. @ISAFmedia
Discussed Air Policing with Latvian president Bērziņš - we seek a long term solution on Baltic Air Policing at the summit in Chicago in May
Today Latvia contributes substantially to #NATO's operation in #Afghanistan - I thanked the president for Latvias commitment
I pay tribute to those Latvians who gave their lives for freedom 21 years ago today. Latvians know freedom does not come for free. #NATO
I am visiting Latvia and I just met president Bērziņš to reaffirm #NATO's commitment to #Latvia
I value the Estonian Government’s decision to increase its defence spending to 2% of GDP this year
#Summit2012 goal: #SmartDefence as guiding principle for our Alliance.  #Baltic Allies can take considerable credit for having shown the way
#Baltic Allies show if nations cannot spend more, they can spend better. Working together = sharing capabilities. #NATO
#NATO’s #Baltic Allies are living proof small countries can achieve great things –  outstanding contribution in #Afghanistan
US review fully consistent w/ Strategic Concept & #SmartDefence, which I expect to be established as guiding principle for #NATO at Summit
#US will continue investing in #NATO because the Alliance demonstrated repeatedly - most recently in #Libya- that it is a force multiplier
The #US' affirmation that our transatlantic partnership remains indispensable to the security of all Allies is key
I welcome Pres. Obama's defence strategic review emphasising importance of modern capabilities, greater flexibility, effective partnerships
Video message - "Thank you to our soldiers" - http://t.co/mtnPGI86 #NATO @ISAFmedia @KFOR_Kosovo
Vaclav #Havel will be remembered as a great writer, a visionary and a leader who helped to reunite Europe after half a century of division
I offer my sincere condolences to the people and governments of Czech Republic and Slovakia on the death of former president Vaclav #Havel
#NATO-#Iraq training successful, contributing to security capacity. Good base for future cooperation. It has strengthened our relationship.
Since 2004 #NATO trained over 5000 military and over 10000 police in #Iraq and provided over 115 million Euro worth of military equipment
#NATO decided to withdraw the Training Mission from #Iraq by 31/12/2011 when current mandate expires
At #Summit2012 we will agree on package of concrete assistance measures for #Afghanistan when the transition progress is completed.
Transition is on track. #Afghan forces growing in strength. Our role will progressively evolve to training/support. @ISAFmedia
We already see promising evidence of progress in first group of provinces and districts that were transitioned in #Afghanistan. @ISAFmedia
Today #ISAF nations made clear our determination to support #Afghan security through transition and beyond. @ISAFmedia
No secret that differences remain on missile defence between #NATO and #Russia. We are committed to finding a way forward
We just had a good all-weather-forum at the #NATO - #Russia council
Tomorrow #NATO talks to #Russia MFO #Lavrov on Missile Defence. Dialogue is vital. Both our defences more effective through cooperation
Partnership #NATO #Russia of fundamental importance. We already cooperate in many areas. Great potential to work together more closely
Recent positive agreements #Serbia/#Kosovo removing first road blocks. More needs to be done to restore full freedom of movement
#KFOR ensures freedom of movement, safe/secure env. in #Kosovo. Restricting this freedom unacceptable. So are attacks against int missions
#NATO Council w/ foreign ministers discussed situation in #Kosovo and cooperation w/ #Russia
Foreign Affairs meeting today and tomorrow at #NATO. Important meeting, preps for #Summit2012. Focus today on #Afghanistan and #Kosovo.
Missile defense cooperation can change the way #NATO and #Russia look at each other. Confrontation not a choice. Only choice is cooperation
We have made it clear that our missile defense system is not directed at #Russia. It is designed to protect European nations. #NATO
Missile threat is grave. Over 30 states have or working on advanced technology. Some of our territory already within range.
#NATO - #Russia cooperation remains of strategic importance. Since Lisbon we have come a long way tackling new threats with new thinking
#NATO and #Russia Can Defend Together http://t.co/co0rjMNS
Transition firmly on track, driven by the determination of Afghan people, sustained by courage of Afghan Security Forces and ISAF @ISAFmedia
I congratulate #Afghan gov. and people. Afghan security forces taking over lead for security in new areas. Significant step forward. #NATO
President #Karzai confirmed second group of 18 Afghan areas to make the #transition to #Afghan security lead for 50% ppl. #NATO @ISAFmedia
#NATO strongly committed to work w/ #Pakistan to improve cooperation. We have joint interest in fighting cross-border terrorism @ISAFmedia
#ISAF is investigating to determine what happened at Afghan-Pakistan border. Lessons will be drawn to avoid such tragedies. @ISAFmedia
Wrote Prime Minister of #Pakistan - deaths of Pakistani personnel are as unacceptable as the deaths of #Afghan and int. personnel @ISAFmedia
Deepest condolences to Pakistani families, government and people following regrettable incident at border. @ISAFmedia #NATO
Cooperation on #MissileDefence would show #NATO and #Russia can build security together. Cooperation, not confrontation, is the way ahead.
I welcome President Medvedev's willingness not to close door on continued dialogue with #NATO and #US on #MissileDefence. #Russia
#NATO's missile defence system designed to defend against threats from outside Europe. Not designed to alter balance of deterrence.
President Medvedev's suggestion to deploy missiles in areas neighbouring #NATO as response to #NATO’s system is very disappointing. #Russia
#Summit2012 goal: #SmartDefence as guiding principle for our Alliance.  #Baltic Allies can take considerable credit for having shown the way
#Baltic Allies show if nations cannot spend more, they can spend better. Working together = increased capabilities. #NATO #SmartDefence
#NATO’s #Baltic Allies are living proof small countries can achieve great things – outstanding contribution in #Afghanistan
Giampaolo was my principal military advisor for 3 yrs – essential expertise, invaluable support for #NATO reforms, great diplomatic skills

Way forward is not spending more, but spending better: multinational solutions to common problems. #SmartDefence #NATO #Summit2012
#NATO operations in #Kosovo #Libya #Afghanistan are reminder that modern security challenges do not stop at our borders.
I expect Afghans to take lead for #Afghan security by end 2014. Next step transition to be announced soon. @ISAFmedia #ISAF #NATO
Fully complying w/ #UN mandate helped Libyans start their journey from dictatorship to #democracy. #NATO
#NATO’s most important mission is defence of its territory and protection of its 900 million citizens.
Protecting people and principles requires soft power to save, to preserve and to build. Hard power to protect civilians from hostile actors.
Principles of #freedom, #democracy, #HumanRights and the #RuleOfLaw lie at the heart of #NATO
Today I'm giving a speech in #Berlin on the Principles and Power that give #NATO its legitimacy.
#Tunisia is a valued partner in #NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue and I look forward to enhancing our #partnership.

Some missiles can already reach parts of @NATO territory. And #Russia also faces a missile threat.  We share same threat.
Over 30 states already have, or are developing, missile technology. Payload and range is increasing. @NATO #Russia
@NATO and #Russia can do more through missile defence. Partnership can move forward faster and further than ever before.

@NATO and the @OSCE have a shared past in making Europe more stable and secure. Our job now, is to make tomorrow even more secure
@NATO and @OSCE could consider joint training before deploying staffs and reinforce our combined efforts on security sector reform
@NATO and @OSCE cooperate today, but I believe we can develop greater practical cooperation on a broad range of issues
@NATO and @OSCE share the aim of building a free, democratic, common and indivisible security community from Vancouver to Vladivostok
On my first visit to the @OSCE in Vienna as Secretary General. The OSCE is a crucial part of Europe’s security architecture next to @NATO.
It is up to political leaders across the Western Balkans to demonstrate the courage and determination to create a better future.
@NATO’s vision for the Western Balkans region is clear:  Euro-Atlantic integration is the best guarantee for peace, progress and prosperity.
The Western Balkans has made great progress too.  But the region is yet to reach its full potential of a Europe whole, free and at peace.
Montenegro is a full and active participant in @NATO's Membership Action Plan. And it has come a lot closer to the Euro-Atlantic community.
In Montenegro giving a speech on @NATO and the Western Balkan. Montenegro has set an excellent example.

#NATO and #Russia could set up joint centre to coordinate defence responses, allowing best and most appropriate response.
Missile Defence makes sense politically, practically and militarily. #NATO is not a threat to #Russia. We will not attack Russia.
#Russia faces missile threat too. #NATO is convinced that cooperating with Russia on missile defence is both our interests
Missile Defence achieves economies of scale - perfectly illustrates benefits of “Smart Defence”. More security for less money. #Russia #NATO
US and European Allies in cooperation to protect European territory through a shared missile defence systems. #NATO
Over 30 states have or are developing missile technology. We cannot ignore these trends. We cannot afford to have even one of our cities hit
Missile Defence is important, and it can fundamentally change how #NATO works with nations to build lasting security and stability
Today I am giving a speech at @RUSI_org in London on #NATO's Missile Defence - and on cooperation's with #Russia

Reforms will deliver an Alliance which is fit for the future – defending us against the threats of today, and of tomorrow
These reforms will make #NATO more affordable, more effective – focusing on the capabilities and command systems we need
Reforms streamline agencies and re-shape #NATO’s command structure, making it more efficient, more deployable, and more compact
#NATO approves reforms to meet the challenges of tomorrow. NATO leaner, more flexible, and better able to deal with future challenges
Transcript of the Monthly press conference - http://goo.gl/MpH0x - #Libya #NATO
#Qadhafi's regime still poses a threat. Attacks against cities such as Zintan. We started this mission. We will complete it. #Libya #NATO
Growing number of people in #Libya can return to normal life. Aid can flow from north, east and west. People can begin to plan. #NATO
Around 10.000 sorties destroyed or damaged almost 500 tanks, armoured personnel carriers, rocket launchers and over 700 ammo stores #Libya
Around 10.000 sorties destroyed or damaged almost 1800 legitimate military targets, around 100 command and control sites. #Libya #NATO
We made considerable progress in #Lybia by seriously degrading the regimes ability to attack civilians and by relieving pressure on cities.
on my blog: "NATO and the Arab Spring" - http://goo.gl/c6cmL - #Libya #NATO
Arab Spring inspired us all. Shown tremendous potential waiting to be unlocked. #NATO is ready, willing, and able to help to unlock it.
Arab Spring underlines need to elevate our dialogue and partnerships to a new level. #NATO
We are prepared to engage with @UN, EU, Arab League, African Union and others to plan for the day after #Qadhafi. #NATO
#NATO will not stay a day longer than is necessary. Neither disengage prematurely.  Transition in #Libya needs to be seamless.
Arab Spring shows need to  elevate our dialogue and partnerships to a new level.  A democratic #Libya would be welcome new partner. #NATO
New #Libya needs modern, democratic security forces that don't attack the people, but protect them. #NATO has unique experience. We can help
Giving speech in Brussels: #NATO and the Arab Spring. Good timing – a new wave of freedom is spreading across the region.
I can assure that today #NATO is a friend of the Serbian people. You shouldn't suffer from mistakes made in the past.
Clear message to Serbian people: your future lies within a positive and fruitful cooperation with the #EU and #NATO.
I'd like to see a strengthened relationship between Serbia and #NATO
Arrest of Mladic removed a stumbling block on Serbia's road towards the #EU and #NATO.
The recent arrest of Mladic is very important. It’s a very clear message that war crimes will eventually be punished. #NATO
Encourage Bulgaria and other countries to broaden efforts on multinational cooperation
Way forward is Smart Defence where NATO countries and partners buy and maintain together
Cut in European defence budgets is a matter of concerns. Risk of degrading capabilities.
Important  Bulgarian contribution to Afghanistan mission, highly valued. #NATO

It is a terrible earthquake and tsunami that happened earlier this morning in the Pacific.

Leaving Kiev very encouraged about future NATO-Ukraine cooperations after good talk with Pres Yanukovych

Most of todays challenges go beyond national borders. Many are inter-related. And no country can tackle them on its own
Ukraine clearly belongs to the family of European nations
In Kyiv: we recognize the sovereign right of each nation to freely coose its security arrangements
Met by protesters in Kiev. What a priviledge we live in societies where people freely can express their views. That's what we stand for.
Speaking at Tara Shevchenko National University tomorrow - named after the man who spoke out for Ukrainian independence. Right place to be
Will visit Ukraine next two days - a highly valued partner. My first visit to Kiev as NATO secretary General.

My question is: how can we afford not to protect 900m people from missile attacks? The cost is less than 200 mill euro. #NATO
We need soldiers who are not stuck in barracks, but who can be deployed abroad! #NATO
We need a security dialogue with India and China. The time for such dialogue has come. #NATO
It's not time to give the #Taliban the false idea that we can be driven out or waited out! #NATO #ISAF
Things are moving in the right direction. It's not the time to waver. #NATO #ISAF
If we finish the job we started, #terrorism will find no home, no safe haven and no inspiration in #Afghanistan anymore. #NATO #ISAF
