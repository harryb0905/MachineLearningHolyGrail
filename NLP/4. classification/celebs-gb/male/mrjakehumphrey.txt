Delighted for you Osi. So proud to of you and the whole @WhisperFilmsUK team 👏👏👏 https://t.co/BO4I9QOYjT
Almost the entire capacity of Stamford Bridge has voted in this poll👇👇👇  We all know players don’t get sacked...but it’s clear what people make of it... https://t.co/ozheClCJqL
@Braithy99 There is literally nothing about me in that tweet. Are you aware are I’m not Olivia Coleman, and I’m not my wife? 😂🤣😂🤣😂
So, @WhisperFilmsUK (the UK’s fastest growing production company!) are us for MORE awards tonight. Beyond proud of the team, the company...and fact we’ve only just begun 😜 https://t.co/sXRjTJoPc1
On the school run I drove past my wife’s old school...which is also Olivia Coleman’s old school!  What an inspiration for all the girls spilling out of there today, knowing they walk in the footsteps of an Oscar winner!! Bottle that &amp; go do great things ladies!!! #NorfolkIsProud
@PWhite09 @sean_brom ‘Sacking seems to be the only answer’   It’s a poll, Paul. With three options...the final one being ‘sack no-one’...
Who would you like to see sacked for what happened today?!?
Feel for Kepa. Takes over as Chelsea manager and almost immediately loses his first game in charge...
Less than 24 hours and reports are Puel is gone. @themichaelowen called it.   He has a home-game win percentage of just 33% in all his PL games.   Has lost 4 successive home games.   Right decision? Right timing?    https://t.co/x70oP7thUm
Puel sacked...
Leicester fans. We’re discussing your team next LIVE on #PLTonight.   Puel in or out?   Why are results and performances so at odds?   What needs to happen?   Get in touch NOW and you may well be on the TV...👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 @btsport
Norwich just casually doing Norwich things again today ...💥💥💥💥 https://t.co/dZIdD8sJAU
Sorry I’m late wishing you happy birthday @ChrisMoyles ❤️❤️😂 https://t.co/6JHy1Vnd8Y
Pochettino far from happy. Lots of people mentioning VAR in relation to the game. Just a note, next season VAR will be in the PL, but wouldn’t be used for corners...so in this instance it has no impact. Huge blow for Spurs.
We are live at Leicester today. And we will pause to remember...and celebbrate... https://t.co/dJnWEf0Xrt
I couldn’t love Daniel Farke any more. Asked about the 25k fine for the brawl v Ipswich...   “My feeling is, it’s too much. It’s even more than we paid for Pukki” 👏👏 https://t.co/MPuf5kiImK
After the ‘handball goal’ tonight, I’m ignoring the VAR naysayers even more. I’ll take a bit of confusion, a wait of a few minutes and at times a dilution of drama...if we get the correct decisions...which VAR tends to deliver...
When you pop out to buy guide pig food and end up as an RSPA ambassador 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/wEweHfVstB
This makes me happy.   Can’t wait to have the legend back doing a game with us soon...something tells me it’ll be a Spurs game &amp; the reaction will be incredible ⚽️🙌🙏🏻 https://t.co/tpTlcID4it

That was moving. The ‘missing man formation’, flown by modern planes, with the names of the 10 who died at Endcliffe Park. Well done Tony!!

Off to Chelsea. Talk to me...  How bad actually is it? Point off top 4, Lge Cup Final, last 16 of the Europa League(probably).   What’s frustrating you more Blues fans? Style of play, substitutions, managers perceived stubbornness, Kante’s position,
I’ve come to the conclusion we don’t need to worry about VAR taking away debate from football...  Morning.
@wilf_toon 👍🏻
@kennybird81 👍🏻
Absolutely agree. I was merely trying to point out how the players had a unanimous and different opinion.   However, I can see how it sounded and I apologised to Peter afterwards who was fine &amp; understood. My bad.  Par for the course sometimes on live TV...for me!! 👍🏻 https://t.co/XbcfTgFuyV

VAR isn’t ruling this one out... https://t.co/qEnG5HXKbb
City have won it!!!!!!!!!
VAR goal disallowed in Athletico v Juve game.
Wow. The pitchside screen wasn’t working for the referee tonight. He wanted to see the pen decision, but couldn’t. Is it then ok for the him to award the penalty? Is the technology really ready? Messy.
No. The UEFA directive is that VAR is there to advise on subjective decisions, but the ref must retain the authority...he should have gone to the screen... https://t.co/TegxStii0T
My issue with that VAR decision is that the ref never looked at it. It was a subjective decision...taken away from the field of play. Regardless of right or wrong call...the referee should be the one to make it using the pitchside screen...

Have a read of the replies @UEFAcom.   You can’t do this without us hearing/seeing the referee and the VAR officials talking(just like cricket and rugby). It’s essential.   Blank faces in the stadium too.   It works, we need it, but hearing communication is the key now... https://t.co/ScCqDs5zLz
Carrow Road? https://t.co/de331cacjq
@tats180 @ChrisMoyles Won’t be long...
Point of note. When it comes to offside(the same as goal line tech), clear &amp; obvious is irrelevant. UEFA have the most advanced 3D mapping available &amp; it only becomes about getting the right call...NOT whether it’s a clear &amp; obvious error. 👍🏻
@GHaynes93 @desert_storm12 @ChampionsLeague He did watch the video....
Good mate. 2nd in the league, wage bill trimmed, young players featuring, a free transfer with 20 goals, an owner who cares, fans who believe, and promotion a possibility. 👍🏻😜 https://t.co/kxmBwKCNBz

An historic first serious use of VAR in the @ChampionsLeague.  -We weren’t too sure what was happening as no ref mic. -It took almost 3 minutes.  -However, a correct off-side decision.  Emotionally it feels weird...and I’m an advocate. Your thoughts??   https://t.co/rCkiKIMxZL
Ajax playing brilliantly. Could be 2 goals up. However, an historic first use of VAR in the @ChampionsLeague denies Ajax the lead...correctly. Welcome to the new-look football.

You said your 1 year old son could tackle a former professional female footballer Liam. Would you call that ‘questioning the level they have played at’. You can’t spout utter crap on here and think it doesn’t impact people. https://t.co/2XrytPTktG
Wow @liamkeane88. Looking at your replies to people I’d love you to watch the show tonight. If you have a daughter you should believe, and make her believe there are no boundaries...
The sexism that spews out on social media whenever a female pundit appears on TV is a disgrace. Tonight on #PLTonight, with @rach_brown1 we call it out.

We are a club with a plan, owned by a fan...and topping the table. We are literally the antithesis of everything people criticise modern football for, and we should be celebrated for it.
Why be negative about NCFC?  Promoting youth talent &amp; putting huge focus on the academy. Playing a first XI whose wages will be small compared to rivals.

Why should the player wait? People are paying to watch KDB, not the ref. Let these brilliant players express themselves, allow speed of thought and brilliance of foot...don’t punish it.   I agree, the ref asked him to wait...but that kills the game. https://t.co/wBqsNXqSMX
Yellow card for Kevin De Bruyne for showing creativity, talent &amp; speed of thought. Do we want that punished?!?!?

@DeanChapman07 @stmartinsnfk Or how about using twitter to share the work of a great charity, make people aware its a problem we can all help with, use Twitter for something positive...rather than sit there chucking around negativity &amp; criticism?🤔
Charities like @stmartinsnfk are helping lower the number of homeless people in Norwich.  However, Flo &amp; I met Dylan &amp; others today who slept rough in -7 degrees last night.   So sad, totally unacceptable, &amp; we can ALL do something. Sometimes just stopping, talking &amp; caring.  ❤️ https://t.co/4u6pbL4Xqk
Currently heading into Norwich. Thinking of anyone who slept rough in our city last night.   If you are homeless, or know anyone who is, I’d love to buy a hot breakfast, if you can get to St Andrew’s Car Park let’s meet there now  and I’ll sort it. ❤️❤️

@Markstanhope1 Top man Mark. You guys do great work. Thanks for coming to our rescue and enjoy the game on Saturday
@adsleeder @lincspolice @FCR_Lincs They were amazing.
Rather eventful journey home from Blackburn last night.

Thanks for your company. Good game &amp; enjoyed the insight from the lads on #FACupTonight. I also spent time outside ahead of the game, meeting Blackpool fans &amp; educating myself on the clubs plight. I hope for all concerned that smiles &amp; stability return to #Blackpool. Great club.

These two have been released without charge, with the gentleman’s friends saying he was at work throughout the drone disruption.  So how is a headline like this - and others - allowed?

The last time Manchester United scored 5 in a Premier League game, Sir Alex Ferguson was the boss.
Over a year since United last scored 3 goals before half-time away from home. Impact.
Man United have been out run in EVERY game this season...they are currently out-running Cardiff...
Manchester United just scored a Manchester United goal. Absolute belter...
No Pukki no party!!!! Yesssss!!!!!
So, @WayneRooney is with us making another debut today. This time on @btsport for Cardiff v Man Utd. He’ll also join us #PLTonight too, so in the spirit of the show, what’s the one thing about his football career you’ve always wanted to ask &amp; we may do it for you...👍

@HC15OnTour Opinions like this are part of the problem. Things need to change. What was acceptable no longer is.

King Of The Transfer Window AND King Of The Jungle!!!!!!!! 👏👏👏 https://t.co/atYYXPJYJG
So pleased everyone’s seen what we’ve known for a few years since he joined @btsport - that @Redknapp is a caring, funny, ordinary guy who loves his family, football...&amp; roly poly pudding. 😂. Whoever wins this deserves it as @JohnBarrowman and @EmAtack have been great fun too❤️
How wrong he was. Well done Harry. Already the king for me!!  👏👏👏👏 #imaceleb2018  #Harry #Sandra https://t.co/3yIfL4RRi2

History unfolding on @btsport. Sarri about to beat Pep for the very first time? Chelsea leading at the Bridge...Liverpool leading the @premierleague 👀
Hi @matthewsyed. Just been speaking to the production team. The footage is all over social media &amp; we’ll make sure the relevant people are sent the footage directly from us. If indeed it is proved to be racist abuse then I hope it’s a lifetime ban. No place for it in this world.
Madness. All Man City...and Chelsea lead!!!!!
Shall I share the text you sent me when we signed him 😜😜 https://t.co/qEi99q8tEl
Well it’s a start... https://t.co/FJA80cdBY1
Today it’s @ChelseaFC v @ManCity - without a single striker starting the game. Welcome to the modern Premier League...this will be fascinating come 5pm ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Exceptional from Salah. 👏👏👏
@ffsGeorge2 Absolutely.
Begovic should have done better, but Liverpool’s opener was offside. #VAR
See you live at 5...👏👏 #buzzing https://t.co/ThF0n2qsKR

Arsenal &amp; Spurs top for distance covered.  Liverpool &amp; Man City top for sprints. So 4 of top 5 doing one or the other.  Top 5 for sprints are 5 of the 7 teams above United in the table.  You can win playing a different way, but it isn’t working and you can’t argue otherwise 👍🏻 https://t.co/UKpL2urLNl

Hi Gem, we did say how well you’ve done, praise Ben Foster and show the great chance for Troy...however, you have been restricted to 28% of the ball and 2 shots on target so praise for City is hardly wide of the mark... https://t.co/oW4lQGj5Em

@Sam_MUFC21 Bet I would.
Disagree. This kind of emotional reaction is precisely what football, &amp; all sports need.   Look at the iconic Fergie knee slide, Mourinho’s touchline sprint, David Pleat’s jig. Moments of passion that encapsulate the emotion of sport... https://t.co/dZVKzJi9MR
Tyson is my Sports Personality Of The Year.  Not just for heart, desire, talent &amp; bravery of this fight...but for what he’s done for everyone struggling with their mental health.  He’s shown you CAN battle back from depression, you CAN be suicidal and recover. A true inspiration.

This so much more than mutual appreciation. It’s a deep connection growing between the supporters, THEIR club, THEIR players, THEIR manager. I’m so proud to support a club owned by a fan, and owned by the fans. #ncfc #proud https://t.co/h37nvsyOMu

Europa League gets plenty of stick, but tonight it’s brilliant for #Arsenal. 12 of the 20 in the travelling squad are home grown, 4 teenagers starting a European game...and 3-0 up after 40 minutes with the youngsters central to it. Future looks bright. 👏👏👏
Tyreece John-Jules on the Arsenal bench tonight. Apparently he has cat-like reflexes.
@stuafc71 @lynseyhipgrave1 @btsportfootball Done.
Is this just a game to some? A chance for a little self-promotion? A photo on stage with a smile on your face? Shameful.   Meanwhile we’ll all be picking up the pieces. https://t.co/lelPmEs3p4
Yep you are confused Ravi. It’s all about head to head and as Spurs scores away at Inter they have better head to head buddy. Therefore either just win, or just match Inter’s result &amp; they are through 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/gjNgkJswmA
Isn’t he. Top guy. https://t.co/KUyua1BTlY
@KatieRainbird @RyanMason @btsportfootball @SpursOfficial 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Contrary to your tweet I think winning with a clean sheet would be to ‘win well’. Head-to-head is key in CL and that’s the only 1-goal win that moves them above Inter... https://t.co/aPpkVoTm4q

Fulham are rock bottom, goal difference -20, (only 1 team has conceded more at this stage in PL history), 7 defeats on the bounce...I think it’s a fair question Mark. https://t.co/j4Pwtbs5Gu
#Fulham fans...what do you think? 7th successive defeat today...time for a change of manager or waitand see what happens v Southampton?

@paulieJ87 I saw your tweet, and did mention it to the team who had already spotted it. However, if they hadn’t you would have been responsible!! Good work 👍🏻😜
What Darrin?! We clearly showed Salah was onside. We covered every single point, in detail, in about 2 minutes. https://t.co/8qlgKMuRBM
Join us right now...we actually think Fulham goal WAS offside, however, the ball was rolling when Alisson took the free kick...perhaps it should still be 0-0?!?!? All the half-time analysis right NOW on @btsport...
Another brilliant day for VAR. it’s looking more embarrassing every passing week that it’s not in the @premierleague. Onside goal denied Fulham...and Liverpool score moments later...

Well, that went as well as expected.

I don’t mind this from Jose actually.  Football would be a less interesting place without all this kind of stuff...  Big week, big win...👏👏👏 https://t.co/9Q1U0ii1vG

It’s may well transpire that the  professionalism, preparation, knowledge and skill of that crew prevented an even larger accident. What heroes.   May all on board rest in peace and their families and @LCFC now find their path in the darkness. ❤️❤️❤️
and fans still filtering out. Hundreds of people in the area. The crew found almost the only safe spot they could...a small square of car park, fenced off from the hive of activity elsewhere.
and were acutely aware of its severity. A number of them also mentioned immediately that they believed the crew, Eric &amp; Izabela, saves many more lives. At that time the area the helicopter came down had a full TV compound producing the live game coverage, stadium staff, police,

@NateGuildea Never known a day like it. To suddenly be broadcasting live about the helicopter was surreal, painful and very very sad. ❤️
After the hardest of days from start to finish all my thoughts are with Glenn and his family, and also everyone here at Leicester City Football Club.
BREAKING: The Leicester City helicopter just crashed in the club car park...no other news
@welsh_lucy Horrible, horrible day. All thoughts with Glenn...

Paul Lambert is the new Ipswich boss. A tough job for him, a good move by them.  I may be in the minority in Norfolk but I don’t want Ipswich in L1. I enjoy playing against them too much...us and them in the PL would suit me nicely...

Arsenal started slowly and look shaky at the back. They’ll probably win 3-0 in the second half judging by the the way the season has gone...

Wembley Stadium is 95 years old. The FA have only owned it for 10 of those 95 years. Obsessing over who owns it is less important than the investment our grassroots desperately needs  It’s a missed opportunity, but grassroots investment now NEEDS to stay on the agenda.

Yesterday was humbling as much as it was enlightening. Despite the focus being on the game, being strapped into a chair made me feel so powerless &amp; vulnerable. And I was crap!

The notion Rashford needs to leave United for the sake of his career is a strange one. The stats back Jose on that one.  However, the same can’t be said for a huge raft of young English players...&amp; we’ll debate it with Rio, Tom Cleverley, &amp; Keown on #PLtonight  Join the debate...

He’s doing so well to stay on his feet...  As are the 2 guys casually strolling behind him 👀  https://t.co/o1PSsxHeF3
Will it be 5 Watford wins on the bounce by Saturday night??
I’ve been to plenty of training grounds over the years, but this one felt right up there in terms of confidence, belief and positivity. Underpinned by extreme fitness, inspired by Gracia, and buoyed by 4 wins on the spin...
CONFIDENCE. As we finished, I wished them well for the game on @btsport on Saturday evening, especially against United’s centre-backs. Troy turned around, huge grin...’I think I’ll enjoy this one’ he beamed.
NUTRITION. Lots has been made of Troy’s weight-loss, but the whole squad now have a new nutrition plan. No more help-yourself buffets, each player has pre-plated, nutritionally targeted food...Troy names and shames Andre Gray as someone who used to enjoy the breakfast buffet 😂
FITNESSS. Both Troy and Christian told me that pre-season was horrible. Javi puts huge emphasis on fitness, and before Troy arrived Kaba glances across to him &amp; said ‘we’re so fit, he’s playing like a 22 year old’
COMPETITIVITY. The fact @T_Deeney staerted our interview with a swollen cheek was testament to the aggression with which they work. He took an elbow from Success. They were moving the ball so fast, and from the moment training started it was clear the staff want max attack
INTENSITY. I was wrong about ditching Silva. Javi Gracia was central to everything, and he was super-demanding. In the middle of the pitch he was constantly shouting ‘faster’, ‘quicker’, push, push’. Then high-fiving players constantly if they did something well.
ATMOSPHERE. It was unreal, everyone walking around with a smile &amp; a bounce. Mid interview Capoue covered Troy, Kabasele &amp; me in water...the thing that usually happens after cup finals! They are buzzing(excuse pun)
Hugely impressed by my visit to Watford this week...here follows a thread for Hornets fans about what I saw... @WatfordFC

A video from @F1 of @Charles_Leclerc most likely having his life saved by the halo. 👏  Heart-stopping stuff.🙌  https://t.co/h4lWLYM7kP
Fascinating. https://t.co/LBl5fzqRji
99.9% have been able to see the positives Charlie, and are full of praise for his honesty. No other show delivers this kind of thing, it is breaking down barriers...and must be supported &amp; encouraged unless we want stars to just act like robots in front of the media for ever👍🏻 https://t.co/EqzYz0mMc4
@burngold Thanks bud 👍🏻
@MarkEglinton I think so 👍🏻
@burngold Which is completely irrelevant to my point - if it’s crap people won’t watch...free or not...
Almost 1.5m views in under 24 hours...says a lot when our chats get such huge numbers. People will only watch stuff on social media if it is compelling &amp; different as it’s a conscious choice to click the link on your phone/computer etc.  #MichaelOwen #PLtonight https://t.co/VZQF2pFXaf
Just make the decision to bring in VAR now @premierleague. We all know it’ll be here for next season, we all know the tech is ready...let’s get the refs trained up and do it. More decisions today that VAR would likely have sorted. 👍🏻⚽️
👍🏻 https://t.co/skyffTSqa2
@sal_lfc Appreciate it 👍🏻
@matthewsyed @themichaelowen Thanks Matthew. #PLtonight is a dream show to present. The guests have really bought into the concept, and it offers something you simply don’t get anywhere else...👍🏻👍🏻
Love my job.
Overwhelming reaction to this interview. Thanks to @themichaelowen for his disarming honesty tonight. Give this 9 minutes of your evening and a share. Thanks🙌  https://t.co/uzVT1y1Em4

You could have said the same for goalline technology, 3 points for a win, 7 subs on the bench. Football has to evolve and I guarantee you it will be in the PL next season... https://t.co/ISD7WDKxWo
Handball goal from Wolves. VAR would have sorted it.   The decision to not bring VAR into the PL this season is ridiculous...the game needs it...
I’m giving away a signed programme from today’s game. Just follow me on Instagram &amp; the winner is picked at random 10pm tonight 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Me too. See you from 5. Big plans today... https://t.co/AZXv3AvMMx

Found it strange this week, I was watching the new Amazon doc...and ended up watching Pep, watching us on #PLtonight. 👀  It was a very honest chat about @ManCity &amp; his reaction was interesting. 🤔  We’re back this Saturday at 8pm after Liverpool v Brighton ⚽️ https://t.co/pWsTox2usr

Thoughts on @NorwichCityFC  Fans were class last night considering quality for 80 mins.  Win was key &amp; although we weren’t great we were better than Preston who almost made last season play-offs.  The key is we are now scoring goals. Lack of pace my biggest concern. #OTBC

My kids are buzzing that @DrRanj is doing strictly. They’re obsessed with him on CBeebies...lots of later Saturday nights for Flo this year...
You probably haven’t seen #PLtonight, or given it a go. You really should tho. I basically sit &amp; listen as players take us into dressing rooms, pull back the veil,  rake over old ground, re-open fresh wounds. It’s compelling, fascinating &amp; unique.   Try it next Saturday.  👍🏻 https://t.co/acrvsbGrUP
Shout out to @limobikelondon. On Saturday I was stuck on the A1 - &amp; without the skill and flexibility of Ceri &amp; his team, I wouldn’t have got to work.

Robert Wickens broke both legs, &amp; his right arm in this #IndyCar crash yesterday. Sending him strength.   2 things - this crash kills him a few years ago but it’s also a reminder once more that we can’t get blasé about safety in motorsport.  https://t.co/NQi45J8fXD
My timeline packed with negative comments about @ManUtd who look in a total mess. However, I’ll take a different angle.   Bravo Brighton!! Brilliant spirit, a famous win, well done CH. impressed, but not surprised👏👏

@fred_fre 👍🏻
We were lucky to watch F1 in an era where Fernando was behind the wheel. A supreme competitor, a complex character, a demanding driver, but a brilliant champion. Fernando - all the best with the next chapter 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
on a different planet. He opened his eyes a few seconds later, he laughed, I laughed...and he went on his way, being a global superstar, and I went home to Norwich. He probably can’t recall it, but I’ve never forgotten it.
That is how talented he was, that is how in control he was, that is how prepared he was, that is how well he knew the track, that is how confident he was...and he drove it perfectly. Now, im not recommending you try it at home...but it’s a raw example that these guys are
My protest that it was only a passengers instinctive reaction fell on deaf ears. He said “this is how safe you are”...and the drove the next set of corners at full-pelt, max attack...WITH HIS EYES SHUT!!!!!   Yep - he drive a complex circuit, in a super car. With his eyes shut.
“What are you doing!? You don’t feel safe with me” he shouted...whilst still keeping his foot planted, the back stepping out, the tyres squeeling. I tried my best to explain that of course I did, it was an immense pleasure to see his God given talent so close.
At this point I made the grave mistake of grabbing the seat of the car for extra support. It was purely instinct, however, Fernando isn’t the kind of guy to not notice, or let it pass without comment...
As you would expect, his car control was breathtaking...he knew the car and the circuit like the back of his hand. By then he would have driven thousands of laps. Mind you, it’s still impossible not to feel slightly petrified when barrelling into a corner at full pelt...
I loved these snatched moments away from the track, without the pressure of the races, without cameras, when the guys were off-duty. A short while later, after a long pasta lunch...it was time to  get into the road car and film...
“Amazing ah?” Said a voice behind me. It was Fernando. He had literally stepped straight off the massage table. All he was wearing was a towel, and a grin, and we proceeded to chat about the pictures and his life at Ferrari.
His office is still there, unchanged from the time Enzo ran the famous old team. I went upstairs to a kind of boardroom, where the walls were adorned with pictures of team bosses, high-powered meetings, different Ferrari’s...an amazing collection of photos. Suddenly...
We arrived mid-morning, and the film crew set about fixing the go-pro cameras to the inside of a 458 Italia(I think) that he would drive me in. I was directed into the former house of the great Enzo Ferrari’s that sits right beside the track...
As Fernando Alonso retires from F1. Let me share this brief story about his supreme talent behind the wheel.   It was the summer of 2011 and I travelled to Maranello(the home of Ferrari) for a day of filming with Fernando where he would drive me around the Fiorano test track...

Phil Foden set up Sergio Aguero for his 200th Man City goal.   He was 11 when Aguero scored his first for City.
Phil Foden looks 100% ready. Causing Chelsea all kinds of problems, penetrating, probing, breaking lines and causing mischief. Brilliant to see.   Hudson-Odoi also had some bright moment. Love it. #EnglishYouth

People on here raging that “VAR gave a goal”. Nonsense. It was, and always is, the refs call.   VAR is simply like a doctor looking at a scan before giving his prognosis. If he gets it wrong, you can’t blame the scan!   VAR has been a great WC addition &amp; is here to stay. 👍🏻

On the train to London so I’m going to pass the time with a Q&amp;A using the new feature on Instagram Stories. Head across to my Insta and get involved xxxxx
England missing a creative midfielder you say..? https://t.co/ZPGBSzutHF
@byronf1 Thanks friend 👍🏻👍🏻
Jordan Pickford mentioned post-game the importance of the support players have had. Others are now tweeting similar sentiments.  In the multi-million pound Premier League era, you may feel the fans are less important. Wheras, in our new social media world...the opposite is true.
This. https://t.co/TkvqU5Mzyi

For so many years England have returned from major tournaments carrying the psychological damage of negative campaigns. Not this time. Tonight is disappointing...this team nothing but exciting...thanks Gareth 👍🏻 https://t.co/OT9PTRxN8e
Nothing but proud and grateful. They’ll come home to a winners welcome. Goodnight x

A timely reminder after that race that a British GP at Silverstone genuinely hangs in the balance. No games or politics, as things stand it’s been unviable for Silverstone. Feel free to message @F1 and @SilverstoneUK and make it clear what a British GP means to us all... 🏎🏎🏎

Croatia and Russia both so scared of England that neither want to win this. Standard.   On a serious note, extra-time is hugely good news for us...
It feels like 2012 all over again doesn’t it? It any country needed a unifying force, in this post-Brexit world, it was us.   Whatever happens from here, the power of football has been laid bare in the past few weeks.   It’s summer, it’s sunny, we’re WC semi-finalists. Savour it.

It’s bloody well coming sodding home!!!!!!!!!! COME ON!!!!!!!!
I’m going to faint.
Kick-off is over 2 hours away still and I’m really struggling. It’s not the game itself that is spinning me out, it’s the opportunity that is before us...how are you feeling??
@Bobby_Seagull Yep! 👀
It’s not really about the football.   More a heady mix of recent tournament struggles, a team that carries little expectation, a group of young, diverse, relatable players that accurately reflect England in 2018, a manager that knows what we want to hear &amp; hugely...social media. https://t.co/MyWt96jJf4
Remember the story I told you about Gareth Southgate a decade ago. Well it seems Newsround have dug out the clip.   Sorry about the necklace...🙈🙈🙈 https://t.co/8RHJryBfzJ

To be drunk(and sleepy) by 8.30 at the @BroadcastDigi awards and texting my wife messages from the toilets about how much I miss my kids, is indicative of how little I get out.   When did this happen to me?!?
@PJM_83 @BroadcastAwards @btsport The lovely @greateranglia staff always let the kids do a cheeky wave bye 👋
@stufard85 😂😂
@Mkbw50 @BroadcastAwards @btsport PR man😂😂. You’ve got me all wrong. My wife took the snap...I was flattered!

@mishcamucka Amazing. Send them all my best and I hope they’re celebrating!!!
The highlight of this for me has been the number of replies from people who’ve had similar experiences with Gareth, and lots of other football interviewees...👍🏻🙌 https://t.co/9K1yGK368R
@simon_proctor @Sinead_Rocks You’re still one of my favourites!!! How are you??
You and the team will be great Pougers. Savour it 👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/Uj6RyEoUzG
Not exactly a life-changing story, but hopefully a little life-affirming. To Gareth and every player pulling on the jersey tonight...we are a nation who believe, and nation who have your backs  GOOD LUCK!!! 👍🏻⚽️ 🦁🦁🦁
And 10 yrs later he leads his country into our biggest game in a decade. I’m so pleased a good guy is getting what he deserves, &amp; from what I’ve seen of his press conferences, his relationship with the media, &amp; how open his players have been, he has stayed true to his principles
We were then asked what WE wanted to do. Which players WE wanted to speak to, whether WE wanted to stick around for the whole of training. Nothing was too much trouble. At the end of training, and our filming, he was the one shaking hands, thanking us for coming, seeing us out.
Straight away he said ‘come and meet the players’ and took us right into the centre of the training pitch, stopped the players working, and told them about us and how crucial he believed sport was on children’s TV to inspire the next generation
10 minutes after we were due to chat to Gareth he came running down the small hill from the training complex to the pitch where we were standing, apologising profusely that he got held up in a meeting. He immediately knew my name...and the name of all the crew I was working with!
Some of the stories you wouldn’t believe!! I didn’t mind it, no worries, it was part of the job, and a kids TV show is hardly the top of everyone’s list!! However, our trip to @Boro about a decade ago couldn’t have been more different.
I quickly got used to being kept waiting 2-3 hours past the time the interview should happen, interviews being cancelled at the last moment, or doing interviews in nondescript rooms to keep us away from seeing training or interrupting players.
Short Gareth Southgate story ahead of the biggest game of his management career tonight...  Back in 2007 I was working on Sportsround on CBBC. I spent my time interviewing all kinds of sports people, plenty of whom were footballers.
@JuliaSnowdonMUA 🙈😂😂
My aim for next season is to walk around football grounds like Caroline Flack walks into the villa...
Twitter awash with Martinez criticism at 2-0 down. Derision when he brings on Fellaini and Chadli.   And when his subs change the game... https://t.co/45TdQ417F8
In case you’re not watching the TV, don’t worry, you’re not missing anything. This game between Japan and Belgium is just like most other matches at this tournament.

People make a lot about footballers wages. I’ve always said they have a long way to rise still.   Dwarfed by NBA, NFL, F1, Golf etc etc.   Football generates huge money, and who should get that money if it isn’t the stars of the game?? https://t.co/MFeoKeqVkp

@kdkilbane77 @BBCSport @BBCMOTD Good job Kevin. You and the whole team 👍🏻
It’s a play-off quality kit at the very least...possibly even top 2... 👍🏻🙌 https://t.co/RBvbC5plS6
Imagine having to beat Colombia then either Sweden or Switzerland and Croatia/Denmark or Russia to make a World Cup Final.   Coming second in our group has worked. Well played Gareth 😉
Spain are OUT. WHAT A GAME.   WHAT A WORLD CUP
Mbappe getting lots of ❤️❤️ for donating his match fees to charity.   It might not fit some people’s agendas, but England players having been doing that for over a decade 👍🏻
Certainly not rich Arthur. Mum was a teacher, Dad a charity worker, went to the local school.  No history of anyone TV in my family, and I lived in a small village in the countryside where NO-ONE worked in media.  I guess I was born lucky...and with a work ethic. 👍🏻🙌⚽️ https://t.co/CMT5PmfYnv

And now we play Japan by winning the group, the whole ‘don’t win the group’ argument is dead. Thankfully. https://t.co/eAOwnAagZj
Fair Play is a crap way to decide groups at an otherwise outstanding World Cup. What would you prefer??
Nonsense to think about anything but winning the game for England tonight.   Do you really think any player won’t be doing all they can to impress Gareth &amp; start next match?   Win, keep momentum, maintain belief...&amp; perhaps avoid teams who have form rather than fame.⚽️👍🏻💪🏻
Morning... https://t.co/N4xErTY1Wg
Nope. I’ve never complained about VAR. I have complained about the way it’s interpreted by officials. How can you ever complain about access to more evidence to make the right call, rather than less? https://t.co/H6Q2rNFvHD

@ca51bee Hi Cassie, thanks for the note. As@I’ve explained to the excellent team at break, who I am sure would have passed on the info, the GP is not for another month, and tickets are usually sent out 2/3 weeks before. Thanks, Jake x

@Charles57Rane No intention of either having a coffe with you, or giving you my number Charles. Not sharing emotions, or speaking up about how you feel KILLS men every week. And tweets like yours add to the stigma.  There is no shame in sharing, talking, expressing, and being vulnerable.

Jack Ross the new Sunderland boss? I imagine coming from a small club in Scotland there will be the usual derision, but this guy has worked miracles at St Mirren - his team also score bagfuls. Hope it works out &amp; great to see clubs looking beyond usual suspects 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

I assume the negativity towards Emery is ignorance?  Want an experienced winner? 5 major trophies in 3 years at PSG.  3 European trophies in the last 4 years(afc won 2 in 50 yrs).  Want youth? He’s 46. Same as Pochettino &amp; Dyche. Younger than Pep, Klopp, Conte, Jose.   #Arsenal

@sav4efc 😂😂😂👍🏻
Sam did a good job regarding results Brian - they needed points and he delivered. However, some fans at Goodison, and seemingly the owners, wanted something else, as they are entitled to. https://t.co/2XXRQ3wnMG
It’s not easy at Everton...starved of success so long, &amp; watching Liverpool play so well just across the park.   However, I love that some fans wanted more than just 3 points. They wanted lifting from their seats, escapism, drama, excitement...that’s what the game must be about.
8th for Everton tells part of the story, not all of it. Sam got and always gets results, &amp; will get other jobs.   But football must be fun, not just functional.   At Everton the manager embodies the fans ideals and in his time there even Swansea had more shots on target...

@Chris_Stark We got engaged there. Harriet’s initial response was to say “as if”...knock the ring out my hand and walk away(I now know, out of shock). As she exited, an old lady came round the corner, saw the ring on the floor, me on one knee, and no partner. 🙈
For those of you who don’t know my wife, the sentence she uttered this morning is all you need to know...  “I’m worried I haven’t worried about it enough”                Harriet Humphrey - 2018

#BAFTA2018 was a bit strange wasn’t it? However, among the oddness, @rioferdy5’s speech was exceptional. What he’s done and who he’s inspired has transcended sport like few have managed. He’s a hero, and not just to United fans...🙌🙌

#ThanksMotty https://t.co/KDKmph9Tnq
8. Motty has impacted so many lives, has brought such joy and captured seminal sporting moments perfectly. For me, he has also directly impacted how I live my life. So, thanks Motty. From me, my kids...and everyone you’ve made smile...
7. However, I now know exactly what he was talking about. Every time I get in from a game at 3am, rather than plumping for a night in a hotel, it’s thanks to John. Every time I ‘over-prep’ for a game, and make notes I never get round to using...its thanks to John.
6. I then asked him his one mistake. “Not enough time with my family and son” he said. At the time I had no kids and the significance of that comment didn’t dawn on me for another 5 years.
5. There was no resting on his laurels. He was preparing for that game as if it was his first. Eye-opening, fascinating, grounding, chastening, and hugely important for this 29 year old keen to be the next Des Lynahm...
4. He went solely to get a days notice of what the view was like from the pitch. He then proceeded to show me his notes, his planning, his prep. It was like nothing I’d ever seen. John would have been 63 at the time, yet wasn’t even remotely relying on his ability &amp; experience
3. He then proceeded to tell me that, despite being at umpteen tournaments and covering hundreds of games, he’d just visited the stadium where he’d commentate on a game the following evening.
2. He was immediately interested in me, my career, and what I wanted to do. I then asked him his one piece of advice. “Work harder than you ever think you need to” be said.
1. A brief story about John Motson as he signs off.  I’ll never forget being a wet behind the ears, and rather nervous reporter for BBC Sport at the Euros in Vienna in 2008. One evening I found myself in the bar with Motty. He bought me a drink and we took a seat in the corner.

Hold on. Built for 798 million. According to reports it may be sold for 500 million but The FA will keep games &amp; income at Wembley worth about 300 million. If it works out that way it makes sense.  Should @FA’s job be running stadia? I don’t believe so... https://t.co/PV11HZPKYn
In the entire 130+ year history of the @FA, they’ve owned Wembley for 19 of those years. Private ownership not an issue, and IF the HUGE money generated is ring-fenced to be spent sensibly at grassroots level then I say...sell &amp; invest for the good of the game...

Simeone has lost the plot pitchside. Ranting and raving at the ref, now sent off too!!!! Crowd loving this...
Strong and brave decision from the ref to send off Vrsalko here. Correct call too. 10 mins in, 10 men for Atletico...big chance for an Arsenal aide who’ve started strongly. Live right now @btsport 👍🏻👍🏻
Huuuge night. Who wins it?

Already getting giddy at the thought of a Liverpool v Real Madrid Champions League Final. What a bloody game that would be...
Not sure. Perhaps an @EDP24 investigation and someone from the local press should ask the council why they would contravene the very policies they spent lots of their own time and effort to formulate? https://t.co/A1xHk7odEi
Narrow because it is absolutely the wrong place for such a development. Amazing that @SNorfolkCouncil can approve a development that directly opposes their own policies. Strange and disappointing. 👎🏻 https://t.co/KrnuDeEoKo
Really feel for @Alex_OxChambo - playing really well and now out of the World Cup. For all that football gives players, nothing can replace missing out on the big tournaments. A real blow for Liverpool &amp; England...
Once again I’m hosting the Drivers Lounge at the #BritishGP in July. Best views, food, entertainment with a few F1 stars thrown into the mix. A few tickets available if you fancy it! 🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎 https://t.co/l28eEzqWYn
An amazing night. In 60 seconds. You’re welcome.  https://t.co/0ahb4yDsqO
What a game. Football is bloody brilliant, and the knockout stages of this seasons Champions League has been stunning. I still think we see Liverpool in the final.
No need for panic, it’s not as if Roma have form in scoring 3 second leg goals against the odds to qualify...👀
Once a red... https://t.co/Klm3DZQo9n
Who else...
Good luck to @GaryLineker leading the brilliant team, in the teeming rain...at Anfield. Huge night... 🙌🙌 2-1 to Liverpool.  @btsport
@simonsmarathon Incredible. Huge congrats and now what’s next...!!!😂👍🏻

Regardless of your thoughts on @piersmorgan, and at the risk of more ego inflation - it’s hard to deny he doesn’t make @GMB an interesting &amp; compelling watch. Well researched, salient questions, doesn’t accept BS answers. Not everyone’s flavour...but at least he is a flavour...
Been awake since 4.30...shall I just get up and start the week!?!?
@FrannyBenali @btsportfootball @SouthamptonFC You were a brilliant addition to the team as usual. Saints are a great club, and if the worst happens you’ll be a loss to the PL...and you’ll also not be away for long🙌
@Wilsonfooty @BBCMOTD @ChelseaFC @ManUtd 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Decent debate among the team. I share the frustration of the #Saints fans. The rule is daft, the goal was fine.  However, Chelsea the better side, and what a final we have. Thanks for your company 👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/CI4OKuW7TL

Good call by Jose to go with Sanchez, and it worked...as did the public criticism of his players a week ago.   Whatever you think of his methods, and his approach...Jose Mourinho wins games when it matters...👍🏻 https://t.co/V3bE1yvJHS
“There are many poets in football. Poets don’t win things”                              Jose Mourinho. 2017
And er, here’s the goal... https://t.co/2XicS6qUUE
Herrera! 2-1!
Great game. Still calling 2-1 to United. Rashford. 83rd minute...
Predictions for the semi-final? I’m saying 2-1 United. You?

A little piece for the @theipaper about why, of all people, @GNev2 has been so great for @btsport. Others wanted to challenge him - and so it’s helped deliver us some of the greatest pundits the game has seen.   As the piece explains...you may disagree!! https://t.co/eajfgZFBV6

Rather an apt day to tell you about the latest @WhisperFilmsUK documentary. The Feud: Fergie v Wenger with more reflections on Arsene and arguably the greatest rivalry the Premier League has seen. Monday at 10pm on @channel5_tv. #Wenger #Fergie https://t.co/D9FY2eTB0h
Arsene Wenger has won 3.9% of ALL the league titles and FA Cups in English football history.  Another cracker from @oilysailor
I’ll miss these chats. https://t.co/MjCQKIzYtq
22 years, 10 major trophies and over 800 games. In a social media era where criticism and derision is tossed around like confetti, Arsene Wenger leaves with his head held high as a true Arsenal legend. We won’t see one man manage one club for over 2 decades ever again.👏👏

Good week to do it JN. Commentary is the hardest job in football broadcasting. No rehearsals, no second chance, no idea what is about to happen. We’re blessed with some great guys on the mic at @btsport - and PD is right up there. Also, absolutely lovely guy. No side, no agenda https://t.co/wDNRM7EVGs

The first day of the new school term!!!! Also the only day of the new school term we don’t rush in late, like an unorganised hurricane...😂
Our refs aren’t perfect John, and last night was soft. However, let’s deal in facts. Refs for the World Cup were picked 2 years ago and Mark Clattenburg was on that list. Then he retired and you can’t swap him for another English ref. https://t.co/P04mnJdEUV

Roma last night, Juve so close tonight, Ronaldo keeping his cool, Klopp out-doing Guardiola, City’s domestic dominance, Sean Dyche’s heroics, the PL relegation scrap, Ruben Neves’ brilliance, Fulham’s late surge...so much more...  ...and some people don’t like football.🤷🏻‍♂️
Of the teams left. Who wins this season Champions League??

GAME OFF.  Liverpool are all but in the semi finals!!!! City now need 4 in 34 minutes.   GAME ON.  Meanwhile...Roma have TWO and are just a goal behind Barca. 👀
Pep has history with this ref - he complained about him being appointed at the weekend. He awarded Napoli 2 penalties in the group stages v City this season, and reffed the 5-3 Monaco game last season...
Imagine refereeing the best team in England football, against one of the most famous clubs in the world...in a game that means so much...and want it to all be about you....👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
No. Yes. https://t.co/FGonjhjGFP

It’s McManaman. And here is the thing Samuel...  Steve is as magnanimous, and generous as anyone you will meet.

Today I will be talking with Steve McManaman, @martinkeown5 and @rioferdy5 about bogey grounds. Get in touch with us on #pltonight about the ground your team just cannot get a win at.
Fascinating in the studio. Rio and Martin trying to work out how on earth you set up to stop this City team...  Half-time chat will be interesting... https://t.co/aSNuQdBESS
Three players have reached double figures for assists in the Premier League this season:  Kevin De Bruyne (15) Leroy Sane (11) David Silva (10)  All three play for one team.
Everton all over the place. So, so easy for Man City this...   2-0. Could be 5. https://t.co/AWg7gtEl6K

Everton are the only current PL team Pep hasn’t beaten. Does he complete the set today???
And regardless of when Big Sam got his job, Twitter would be numbingly predictable... https://t.co/XmJ3Qb27Bd
Everton would be 6th if the PL season had started the day Big Sam was appointed...

In reality...very few single tickets remain, it is ‘Sold Out’ on the MCFC website, and the only reason it took a while to be sold out is due to the way MCFC allocate tickets for sale, not due to lack of interest. As you were. 👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/khG8M1gecz

I agree Shane. I’m not sharing an opinion on VAR, just simply pointing out that officials from the Bundesliga have (rightly or wrongly) naturally progressed from clear &amp; obvious... https://t.co/swmCV1l1WH
For a bit of context, they’ve been using it a great deal in Germany, and the refs have slowly used it less for ‘clear and obvious’ and just use it to simply make sure their decision is correct, which tonight it was. Less experienced VAR refs will not be so clinical... https://t.co/SrYSpp69fJ
Not going to sit here and stress about VAR. I watched my mate @SimonThomasSky’s little lad Ethan lead out the team...with a lump in my throat. That puts penalty decisions somewhat into perspective...🙌 https://t.co/5rIXTCr36b

VK is right. As is often the case.   TV companies get a lot of heat about the modern game. However, your club decides how they splash the cash we give them. Affordable tickets, subsidised food, free away travel, huge community programmes should all be on the agenda... https://t.co/lqqXsg4qJQ
@RichARowley Hope it helps pal. At the very worst you can use it as a doorstop. Good luck with it all 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Can’t say decision is wrong, but timing is daft. 1 win in 17, it’s looked for weeks like he isn’t going to sort it out, but who can realistically get to know the players and turn it around with 8 games to go? Who do you want in Saints fans? Many saying Marco Silva... https://t.co/GDjVDAMMiQ

VAR was always going to be here to stay. And now it is. However, with not every nation using it domestically, will we have a situation at the World Cup where a ref is using VAR for the first time.
It’s ruining the flow of press conferences, and I’m not sure the audience are sure what’s going on...
Apparently the VAR press conference in Zurich has been slightly delayed. How very apt...

Thank you - to each and every one of you ❤️❤️
Thanks for the kind comments, but I don’t deserve praise for heading out in a warm car to help people the last 2 days. My brother-in-law who works for the NHS, was walking to work. He, &amp; the rest of the great @NNUH staff have been amazing...as have all our emergency services 🙌

True. However, look at Otamendi, Stones, Raheem and others. Don’t be blinded by the money...he’s doing so much more than just writing cheques... https://t.co/usKW1bY18Y
For all the money spent at city, the 3 goalscorers today being pre-Guardiola act as a reminder he is also busy improving what he inherited - and that shouldn’t be overlooked.
Brilliant from Kompany. Poise and power...
So weak from Mustafi. Sums up so much about Arsenal.

To come into a league he knew little about, to lose huge experience from the changing room, to blend an almost entirely new squad, &amp; be a few points shy of the play-offs is remarkable by Daniel Farke. I now know what my club is, and where it is going...&amp; I’m with them 👍🏻 #ncfc

How has your team fared today? Send in your three word match reports now! #PLTonight
Aubameyang STARTS!!!!! 5.30KO @Arsenal @Everton @btsport https://t.co/b79B1lsovG
@vivajakers @AshChapman94 Not for the team or today’s result, but for the experience, confidence and understanding the young player gains. It also sends a message to the academy. Read your reply out before hitting send...😉
@JCrookz @TMillo You promote tour best youth player. They do t need to play but the message getting the call does to him &amp; the whole youth set-up would be invaluable...
@AshChapman94 They wouldn’t need to play!!! He’s no worse off with 7...and the 7th purely there for the experience. To get the call does the opposite of damage confidence...
@FPL_Ted Wouldn’t be a waste...it would be a invaluable...
So they can’t join the 1st team today? Hear his team talk, be part of the warm-up, experience it first hand and spend 90 minutes on the bench? Do me a favour... https://t.co/kTmFTfoUdp
Pep Guardiola is a genius, he’s shown up the rest of the league this season and done it with style. However, to name 6 subs &amp; claim he doesn’t have anyone else available shows him up. It is tosh. Promote a youth team play for the experience...
Emotional day at Carrow Road.  Raise the roof on 52 minutes for a Canary fan taken too soon.  And before kick-off, make the coolest dude Ethan feel special - which he is...thanks!!  👍🏻👍🏻.  https://t.co/nue6j6m4aL
I wrote some words in my room about an hour before, but as I don’t use an Autocue, what came out was quite different...and just what we were all feeling. https://t.co/dbZqWiJYEY
The @btsport coverage of the 2017 Europa League final has been nominated for ‘best live broadcast’ in the @SportSJA Awards.  A night when a game of football became so insignificant yet so very symbolic.   https://t.co/DEVqnPTKyC
That didn’t take long... https://t.co/ybIzytQezo
And what a signing he’s been for us 👏👏👏👏 https://t.co/hEqgMSZ9s8
If you read and share one thread today, make this thread it. But don’t stop there...take the advice onboard...👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇 https://t.co/LxcTC1AIsa
It’s a proud old club, and the pride spills down from the SJP terraces every home game. It’s our absolute pleasure to feature you on @btsport - good luck for the remaining games 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 https://t.co/G4QpPlDSvI
@Swampmonster9 @worflags Done 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
As someone said today. A classic bit of Geordie attitude. The love for the club shines through in this... #nufc https://t.co/kARTWUzWK3
Which three words sum up the January transfer window for your club? Myself and @RioFerdy5 will be reading out the best on #PLTonight
2-0 down. An hour gone. United need something badly here.   Fellaini coming on for Pogba.
Exact timing for Eriksen’s goal was 10.5 seconds. 0.6s slowed than Ledley King’s record...   Live on @btsport right now ⚽️⚽️⚽️
Get your #DeadlineDay questions in for @rioferdy5, Frank Lampard &amp; Harry Redknapp. We're live with #PLTonight until 11pm. https://t.co/rw2P6KUuZX
Wembley. Live. Ahead of Spurs v United... https://t.co/DxZzitFVym
Going to be fun tonight. Spurs v Man U from 7.15pm and live until 11pm as the transfer window closes... https://t.co/na3CaVr7QX

Batman would be proud to drive this new @FIAFormulaE car. Take note #F1... https://t.co/qIDv027Zti
Still can’t believe that Jurgen Klopp ludicrously even thought to suggest that broadcasters can influence added-on time in a football game...😳 https://t.co/a7rHodoCn0
Great day...till I missed my train back to Norwich by 8 seconds 😖😖😖 https://t.co/DYJYTmfygx
Here we go then...2 mins to the 5th round draw...! #FACup
My One Show wave... https://t.co/LWfFL3AlAf
Text from my wife....❤️❤️ https://t.co/SMMYWX8Ldq
Just did the draw rehearsal for the 5th round of the #FACup... https://t.co/jsDuCrZ05L
Laughable. Not only would we accept any amount of injury time, we had no need to rush of air...it’s also impossible for us to influence such a decision. https://t.co/hQ4Cj43L7m
Train-life.  Heading to London...hosting the draw for the #FACup 5th round on the One Show tonight at 7pm...who do you want???? https://t.co/AfwhtCMuvS
Incredible bit of writing from @SimonThomasSky. The most remarkable part is that the one thing this kind of honesty and openess takes in incredible strength that Simon doesn’t even know he has... ❤️❤️ https://t.co/yyX1N65rMH
Wife, mother-in-law and @BrendanCole....it’s the dream trio...😉 https://t.co/Y71ajMqGOW
Looking forward to catching up with @BrendanCole in #Norwich tonight. Last time we got together it was 30 degrees in Mallorca...slightly different setting this time around 😂🕺🏻🕺🏻
He is bloody brilliant. Hate to think where we’d be without James this season... https://t.co/FFL23I5eQN
10pm - live TV in Liverpool 10am - live bouncing...in Norwich  #DadLife https://t.co/0eh8bq7e7w
@paulorowso I literally thought there were 26 hours in a day I’m so tired...!
Photo reflective of my brain function right now. My 6am alarm call feels like about 21 hours ago...  THATS BECAUSE IT WAS!!!!!! 😣😣 https://t.co/wVprpQvOlX
“Rodriguez for England”  Gerrard has his say... https://t.co/SfkMvNrdG2
I’m an advocate of VAR...as I think correct decisions trump all else. However, got to be quicker...!!!
And people thought VAR would put an end to debates... 👀
Really Martin?   Both decisions were correct, VAR working perfectly. Fans in stadium need to know what’s happening, players need to behave better and s reeen between dugouts not a great idea...but the tech works. https://t.co/K8PcOQrGfB
And there was me wondering how we would follow the Newport game...
Amazing how quickly players and fans have started asking for VAR. 23 minutes in and 3 goals scored, one goal disallowed from VAR...and now a pen awarded with VAR...all kicking off...
He was smiling. 2-1 https://t.co/Kc1SdEAlZr
And West Brom LEAD!!! https://t.co/YeePOrsMfi
Liverpool led for 68 seconds... https://t.co/vSjK4bnexg
Wow. 7 minutes in and 1-1 here at Anfield. Love the #FACup 🙌🙌
Newport may feel frustrated that they held Spurs for 80 minutes but didn’t get the win...but they shouldn’t. They deserved the draw, and they and their brilliant fans deserve their day out at WEMBLEY!! Bravo @NewportCounty 👏👏👏👏
20 minutes to play. Still no Spurs shot on goal... https://t.co/9kj1RG0JKf
Newport impressive from minute one. Effort, desire, ambition, and an excellent goal. Also fully deserved - Tottenham without a shot on target in the first half...
@DCKimTaylor Worth the journey!!!
The classic long throw approach catching out Spurs... https://t.co/potxwr0OLc
