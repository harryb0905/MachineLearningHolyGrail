I have no problem with that. My problem is them calling me at home &amp; threatening and warning me. Very aggressive language. https://t.co/zOnnWpn8Do
I can see why now. Didn’t expect @Uber to call me at home and threaten me or give me “warnings”. Am sure @Lyft won’t do that. https://t.co/TlDDnMsvqM
Just be aware. @Uber_Support a representative from Uber called me and said this is a warning that my account will be suspended if I ever allow my 17 yr old daughter to use it unassisted. His exact words “take this as a warning”. Must open account with Lyft.
I think you are very confused in regards to what your issue is. Sad. Have you sought help? https://t.co/Nu532G13HF

I see you are judge and jury and have decided that “companies” are all guilty Have a great happy life with that thought https://t.co/ym0b1nyCH9

Nobody knew who the guy was until it was RT’d by the Power of twitter RT’s. It cannot negatively impact investigation It is not a jury trial. Anyway it is not in U.K. as all of us following and taking care to ensure he is brought to justice are aware. https://t.co/Ufh4PmXmm9
You are absolutely and totally wrong. The sharing of the video has led to a warrant being put out for the arrest of the dog killer. His name is now on the warrant  and he is in hiding. He will be caught and brought to justice. No thanks to you https://t.co/5ebpqxCQdV

Stupid is as stupid does.  Anyway let’s get back to the important and serious issue of Brexit  How do you think it is going?
No of course not, what a silly question. You stupid man 😂😂😂 https://t.co/9t8mdtj8fB
Wonderful news. https://t.co/fEw5D47NID
That is easy.  You tell her what she is saying is stupid. https://t.co/rqoIWo9orq
So your answer is? https://t.co/YWHXillHqi
Just a thought.                                         If a man called Theresa May a wonderful, intelligent and caring woman would that be sexist?
Yeah but my deaf friend says woman and he is bigger than your dead friend. So there 😛😛 https://t.co/qSS2slqNMP

I have no idea how you managed to come to that conclusion The perpetrator was sentenced to nine months https://t.co/zUKm9ArbID
Nope. The young lad never threatened anyone. You made that up https://t.co/rKcAY7Udrl
Nope but I don’t see why we should allow an American to slag off our country by making it something it isn’t. He said we are lawless, the perpetrators were caught and dealt with weeks ago. https://t.co/3Sb8xYzrwp

I think is her claim but I don’t believe her https://t.co/UMQCEi3bdh

Where you work, where you play, where you visit, where you live if someone requires a defib you must, must, must dial 999. A defib will bring someone back to life but they still need to go to hospital. In an ambulance. Dial 999 https://t.co/HSfCCdD54p

Why are you so heavily focussed on what you call “celebrities” when 99% of the public that “chastised” the bully were not, are not, and don’t claim to be “celebrities”  Why are you “up in arms” about the general public? The decent normal ordinary people? https://t.co/OPUTYmN9d6

I was on the show for 4 weeks and nobody ever told me when to shower ever.  Well there was that one time when I started to smell a bit. (Ok a lot) https://t.co/tdSka75oKs
Yes of course. And Scotland will have no problem creating a border with either Ireland or England or Wales, will it?  https://t.co/dTI8EWwURd
@CandiceCannes @imacelebrity Yes. Keep calm, laugh everything off &amp; do as many trials as you can But, you get paid the same no matter how long u are in so maybe just refuse to do anything &amp; get back to his lovely wife early.  ❤️❤️

Show me your best  drawing of a non gender person please 😂😂 https://t.co/sOZnnrHVcA
I would agree. But some women are saying that by putting that point forward you insult women. And now a man ( who might well be a single father) says the situation discriminated against him. 😩 https://t.co/PoVkyXNwy4
Yes. That would work for me. https://t.co/2W1koDEKiX
I disagree, I think the child looks non sexual. https://t.co/tSSbygKVkF
Apparently it does to some people. https://t.co/xtEtLv9oNY
Actually. I think the man that complained has a point. Why not make the parents silhouette non sex just like the child is? https://t.co/Jg32gUwNEo
Glad to see the @DailyMailUK outing Karen Brady as a ‘hypocrite’ as that is what I have felt she is for some time now A woman that will slag off a hard working single mother that she has not met cannot be seen as a ‘champion’ of women

Due to my dyslexia I did not receive a proper education and left school at 15. I really don’t give a damn about your bullying. https://t.co/Xk00UjBlOr

Well if you sent me one I would give it a try.  But my back pain is controlled by Iyengar Yoga. https://t.co/zASfh67w0a

I think you will find I actually inferred that there is no solution to requirement to have a border in Ireland  So I didn’t profess to have a solution but rather I professed not to have a solution. https://t.co/FnfHxtBXro
Hardly “spouted” but let’s hear your solution without you making personal comments please https://t.co/YFgUfWVX53
Really. The scenario you put forward suggest committing 4 offences then crying about it. I would never put myself in that position https://t.co/8alZwpawHt
Really? Would what you call “an average man” be able to afford the expensive lawyer I was referring to? https://t.co/IjSuegeTn9

I was referring to a proposed law that 1 would say that. https://t.co/63NUnfx9pb
I can assure you that young girls do not use the men’s changing rooms https://t.co/4Pac19NBhJ
Untrue. You have not read my view properly https://t.co/JNSeeFfSTs
I agree in regard to the future. But we live in today. https://t.co/C3uQp8lytU
I have no problem with that but in the U.K. there are many premises that don’t have 3 changing rooms or room to adapt. https://t.co/HHd1ZRL2dp
BTW I have not banned anyone so why would you ask that? https://t.co/AD737zU7Yy
As far as I am aware all gay men use the gents changing rooms and the ladies with children in the ladies changing room are happy with that arrangement. https://t.co/AD737zU7Yy
I am supporting no one other than the women and children in my changing rooms https://t.co/RsRTam9rDx

Agreed.  But we must stop it in order to protect women and children. https://t.co/jTl6NhbfsN
You say this you appear to advocate for a law that allows a person with a fully functioning manhood to use ladies changing facilities? Even with young girls changing in them? https://t.co/M1GWb4hOCB
Really. You think he looked more feminine with a fully functioning penis?  You don’t believe women have the right to separate accommodation from this? https://t.co/mkfLbE2FTA
Fantastic.  Well done. Was honoured to be there. https://t.co/1TLqfss0cs

I think it is important that we discuss proposed new laws before they are imposed on us https://t.co/HzvU9THlEE
Exactly. https://t.co/Lmjvad5TA8
Nope. The conversation is about a proposed law that allows any man to declare he now represents as a woman and requires to use female chsniging rooms. https://t.co/qUcQbju13l
Fisherperson? https://t.co/XZ9KjZu9hC
It is always someone else’s fault with Mourinho Isn’t it?                          https://t.co/thqCLaignd
I agree.  But the law might not. https://t.co/THcltzX1EE
The proposed law change that was being discussed in my tweet line is a law that would allow any man at any time to declare he represents himself as a woman and therefore must be allowed to use ladies changing room https://t.co/MSPVZQWW0T
The problem is that if a man can just choose to be a woman and demand access to female changing rooms and toilets it will be abused https://t.co/k1qJ0L83su
He has not been sentenced yet has he? https://t.co/bEOnctkilh

@BBArtiste hi. I have been following you for a few days now and did not get the piece of art promised?
If it is then he still gains from the money raised. Also he has a better chance of winning if review goes in his favor. https://t.co/K5AE3p034y

If the review goes in his favor won’t that give him a greater chance f winning a civil court case? https://t.co/EnukfV47yh
Do it https://t.co/a5d4qr2ojZ
If one raises money by crowdfunding, goes to court &amp; wins a substantial payout. Who gets the payout? The funders ? The claimant? A charity? #justasking https://t.co/C5eP0OPZuJ
Little trip to Sandbanks Miami Beach https://t.co/mh1nhGGAZB
Please sort @Bannatyne. https://t.co/QUKjoyOfKe
Done https://t.co/i52Hb3XKnY
Whether there were “gatekeepers” or not we are currently living in Miami so it is a long way to come. Also your link requires my Facebook password to open it and I won’t do that. But thank you anyway. https://t.co/0KFGFljxaf
You miss the point of the conversation. Which is. The government is collecting huge amounts of tax in different forms but it is not being properly used to support our poor and needy. https://t.co/fu8ACNf2R4
Well you know very little about service business that is consumer facing. Biggest expense is staff employment costs. Somebody has to pay VAT to Customer &amp; Excise or it would be a pointless tax https://t.co/CKptNimr41
That represents about 20% of my expenses https://t.co/CKptNimr41
1 you would not this if none of your customers were VAT registered. 2 it is not a fully competitive market https://t.co/xjv3mU8JqT
Don’t forget that is a tiny amount https://t.co/QUlDBOxV2V
Rubbish https://t.co/NlcziE4VTA

Don’t forget my £20m per year VAT payments. https://t.co/VjmvWFpfIX
It might or might not be small change. But imagine if could cut 100 “small change costs” imagine if some millionaires resented paying tax because we treated the tax they paid with utter contempt &amp; that caused them to find ways of paying less. Just imagine. https://t.co/MwqGQfk8fB
About 3,500. https://t.co/VjmvWFpfIX
Ok do that as well as but not instead of. https://t.co/PgcBphutyB
Yep. https://t.co/enO8NpDCHc
I think it might be £350 now but glad you agree. https://t.co/P7Jzk91G99
Tell me how giving those MP’s a subsidised bar in London, many miles from there constituency helps those constituents please https://t.co/e4GAQWH6Gc
Nope.  If you cut our government in half it will still be large government. If you take out the subsidised bar in House of Commons or monitor MP’s expenses it will still be a large government If you monitor foreign Aid it will still be a large government. https://t.co/pNLWSpbjtz
Too many people use the “millionaires got a tax cut” line. Better to concentrate on reduducing costs of operating the country. EG reduce number of MP’s, expenses of the MP’s left, Lords &amp; Ladies, foreign aid, grace &amp; favour houses, ex ministers security costs &amp; someRoyalty costs. https://t.co/0jScHm3Ip0

I watched the film “The Shape of Water” on flight to Miami. What a brilliant, amazing film it is. If anyone had told me what it was about I don’t think I would have watched it so don’t ask just watch it.

@PugMuth It is very noticeable that you did not ask what food or drink I cut out. You just want to believe it is a fad.
You can tell them to stuff there bodies with gluten all you like but I know different https://t.co/LRBkL4JWvQ
Rubbish. https://t.co/7fLX238XlX
Yes but I never buy products labelled “gluten free”. I mean why I do that? https://t.co/kcNxJmFSuo

I went into a restaurant recently, told them I was Gluten free. Ordered baked fish. Chef said he had to charge more for Gluten free fish. I said why?

I don’t run leisure centres https://t.co/NCzDWnDS9o
Thank you. If the council pool had to pay VAT at 20% that would be £5.70. Our membership is £42 per month so that is 2 swims per week at less than £5.70 a swim.  An absolute bargain https://t.co/1nyGRdmDV2

Of course. Any industry funded by the deep pockets of the tax payer can do it different. And council leisure centres don’t pay VAT to HMRC. https://t.co/o4LDajjFWW
Not true https://t.co/3i8O4RgYdP
@leebandoni Exactly
Exactly the question we would be asked if we did swim only membership. Then, can you do a classes only membership or spinning only membership or swimming plus classes only or gym and pool with no classes membership. #cantwin https://t.co/ObTRtWASGI

I don’t have a stance https://t.co/fgEywKz9dx

Does @jeremycorbyn know his MP blocks Duncan from Scotland for asking a polite question? https://t.co/TcrBxs2eFk
I have no particular connection to any political party at this time but I asked this Labour MP a perfectly sensible and polite question and she blocked me What is she so afraid of?  Her shadow? Democracy? @dianajohnsonmp. ???? https://t.co/YsjazIjGzZ
The MP Dianna Johnson just blocked me for asking her this perfectly sensible and polite question.  What is she so afraid of? Democracy? https://t.co/3tFrmFIGKm
@MichelleDewbs Hey. Dianna Johnstone just blocked me for who she considered would know what they were talking about on Gender Pay Gap.  #unbelievable
Diana. Would you like to explain who you think knows what they are talking about in relation to gender pay gap? A nice little list would be very helpful. https://t.co/XVsMS7t1P2
I am sure most housebreakers agree with your stance https://t.co/H2uNo3m9zC
I am very happy to hear that Richard Osborn-Brooks has been released and I sincerely hope there are no charges pending against him in relation to his defence of his home
Rubbish. He was being threatened with a weapon and The second burglar was on his way upstairs where his wife was asleep. He acted in defence of his wife and his home. I would have done same thing https://t.co/zwXO96nfNI
Now quote The criminal Law (defence and dwelling) Act https://t.co/2q4NnqAGbx
clearly you have not studied law and you should stop giving incorrect advice on legal matters https://t.co/NShjCeGVNt
Agreed https://t.co/yV2hHFQPRx
And I am confident that is exactly what the 78 year old man did https://t.co/rlTlTuvrp0
So at the age of 78 faced with a young fit burglar armed with a screwdriver you will defend yourself how exactly? https://t.co/8kkacsro8b
You can legally kill someone in self defence https://t.co/zxv04f3GGq
Where did you see that. All I have read is that he has been arrested on suspicion of murder. https://t.co/8QyD9BL7Zw
Is it you Rylan? 😂😂 https://t.co/jiw9Rs8Vx8
I doubt very much that it was a murder https://t.co/QTusBIUgvS
Surely it could be murder but I doubt it very much. Surely it could be manslaughter but I doubt that. Surely it could be self defence? https://t.co/P6bY0GBcBd
Very dishonest of you to say I requested a medal for someone killing someone. What I said was A 78 yr old man faced with a burglar carrying a screwdriver defended his home and he deserves a medal. The fact that the burglar got killed with his own weapon is his fault. https://t.co/VG1MUbNJU3
Nope https://t.co/u8zwTyCgdB
In defence of the screwdriver I have to say there is no evidence that is was f***ing anybody or anything https://t.co/Gh2cOkdABn
Well the short answer is that you could kill someone  by stabbing them with a screwdriver once https://t.co/2Wwjjm00Ej
The burglar had the screwdriver when the fight started. The 78 yr old man is a hero in my book. I am in. https://t.co/2LsyOtUQaQ
Well if arrival is true we know two were attempting to rob a 78 yr old man One of them was armed with a screwdriver The 78 yr old man defended his property https://t.co/Yjk47pNcaX
No but for defending his home at 78 yrs old against two men one of whom was armed he is a hero https://t.co/tdr7q68dSq
Arrested?  He should get a medal https://t.co/KD7H2T0W8q

Yep. https://t.co/COfy9oCUu2
You are 100% correct https://t.co/WQ6XpSgVY5
No we are all saying we should. https://t.co/4PA2YnTMsC
My point is @jeremycorbyn said he will make them pay more tax. I just asked him how he would do that. I didn’t get an answer. https://t.co/KJxKbjwDQO
Ok. How would you collect that tax from a company registered in California which is protected by the tax laws of USA please https://t.co/u4hgsZeZXs
I agree.  I just asked @jeremycorbyn how he would ensure that happened https://t.co/EPs7A6eZdh
Yes but I assume you live in U.K. so are liable for U.K. tax. I don’t think Google, Amazon, Uber, AirB&amp;B and etc are https://t.co/worDFQh5Ne

If what you just said in your last two sentences is true then nobody smokes in cars with passengers. Yet this thread started with a pic of someone smoking with kids in back seat of a car. https://t.co/GD7yycZ89Q
It is only pointless if think everybody will ignore the law. If you do that must mean you think everybody is crooked? https://t.co/RWaRz6iXKH

Where did you get the £50m figure from? Make it up? https://t.co/JbLHEZoVet
If hypothetically the U.K. bid was £100m lower you would still support the French bid https://t.co/GrYSUWTldE
Did you make up that figure of £100m? https://t.co/j3e3BzSbxr
U.K. passports made in bloody France.  No more to be said.  MADNESS https://t.co/9ox15FZ0oh
@piersmorgan Absolutely so true. Idiots.
No it isn’t. More work produces more jobs, more tax and reduces benefits. https://t.co/QQyEAAS2MR
Some U.K. companies were not given opportunity to bid https://t.co/Y7kMp4VYpB
No it is not. Companies in U.K. did not get opportunity to tender on U.K. passports and France does not allow U.K. to tender on French Passports https://t.co/v8OhZOtLaP

It is not “the governments life” it is enshrined in the law that a life sentence means a period in jail then the rest of the persons life on licence. You need to advocate to change that law not blame a government https://t.co/FZSgA98Us3

Exactly. I taught all my kids to swim and thoroughly enjoyed doing so. https://t.co/yByWVZFeCp
I never said they could be more helpful https://t.co/67VO7KTlQC
Hi. Are you a member of one of our clubs? https://t.co/dUOIgVUmP6
Exactly my point. We don’t charge £6 We charge £5. And we collect £1 got VAT office. https://t.co/h92uYNQ1Dt
Thank you https://t.co/1FvNkMTA2X
@championi You can sit at home with your bottle. Pore it yourself and have no overheads. Enjoy.
Thank you. Best wishes, have a great Christmas. https://t.co/hCwN2SJQ6s
You forgot about the VAT, staff costs, heating, rates etc etc etc https://t.co/zmZ0QiF18p
Thank you Deb. I think £6 in a 4 star hotel is reasonable. https://t.co/0xBvqgWwnz
May I ask how old you are? https://t.co/F0JUdIKwNu
Really? You think £6 for a G&amp;T is expensive. I wish I could get one for that in London https://t.co/WoQ7Py2xZT
Oh dear. I can assure you that I meant no offence by pointing out the year that went to school https://t.co/lxUbLLH6Mh
@KellyK22 Great to hear. Keep up the good work in overcoming the issue.
What? I was agreeing with you but explaining to you that the case was different 63 yrs ago than it is now. I assumed you were much younger than me &amp; didn’t know what schools were like 63 yrs ago. I don’t see how that is patronising??? https://t.co/HH9bTdgRef
Thank you https://t.co/fAPjVwg0pY
Nope. It has never even affected me let alone stopped me Some of the education mafia snobs come across are very sad and a bit bitter sometimes , don’t you think? https://t.co/4a1RG9V18T
Yes I understand. Not sure if that is called number dyslexia or if there is another name for it but I was opppsite with numbers so I concentrated on that. https://t.co/gWKjiZBl9z
Thank you. I fully understand and agree. https://t.co/xoayoBSwjd
Correction. It was 63 yrs ago when I first went to school not 53. I am usually a bit better with numbers. 1954 by the way. https://t.co/QxHgwSXM4J
Not 53 yrs ago they didn’t. Not with over 30 in a class and no teachers with an understanding of dyslexia. Some were more interested in trying to force us to write with the right hand Very unhelpful. https://t.co/QxHgwSXM4J
@Tenner_Huey It is very difficult to learn after reaching the age of 46 which is the yr I was first diagnosed as suffering from Dyslexia. Anyway, the issue is that bullying dyslexics causes great despair to young sufferers Not all issues can be solved with money
It is ok to be educated and brag to those that were not fortunate enough to receive an education if it makes you feel good and you don’t give a damn about anybody except yourself. You were born that way. https://t.co/cQJE6UdZvD
As you suggested. Throw the odd half billion away. It is nothing https://t.co/3SMg1guuDo
@iainlee @samaritans Well done on your time in the jungle. 😃😃
Ok Kim. You were educated and I wasn’t. Rub it in like a bullying show off I can take it https://t.co/zkX5EdibRy
Ok then just ignore the odd half billion here and there if it means nothing to you. https://t.co/FOBMyE0qCc
Yes.  They do that anyway I believe. https://t.co/rFMa5AgnM0
I would suggest closer to £500m https://t.co/JDaoFGtlfi
Why don’t they put it on there manifesto then? https://t.co/R3iC8hsJNV
No an annual wealth charge is not stamp duty. https://t.co/IMGnamMiuy
Is there a government that you believe will implement it? https://t.co/QKH5d0oXfy
Fair enough https://t.co/XjjBQyUNw7
I agree many do but think 90% is a bit high https://t.co/rw9bNp9De7
I think a wealth tax on all residential properties worth over £5m and not occupied by U.K. tax payers would be a good start https://t.co/QYnOriLMdv
You didn’t mention houses owned by offshore corporations left empty for years and years https://t.co/HfixsqJx5R
It is open https://t.co/hCT6jU1e4T
Nobody should ever vote against making homes fit for human habitation, regardless of party https://t.co/yw8q5HprFC

Put them in jail for fraud and make them pay back all misbegotten expenses It is only way to stop it. https://t.co/apklt8E4cM
I am puzzled as to why Lord Bassam is not being charged with criminal fraud.  Why not I ask?
Well said Suzi. https://t.co/tNe7UlSWij

I think you need to see a good therapist https://t.co/iZm3uYsfgG
@NickHackett2 @IanNaihslaw @withorpe The law in U.K. clearly states that you can only go to jail for committing  a criminal offence. Do you advocate changing that law?
@Zeshanforever1 DM me
Well it is not fastest in U.K. and we only have car parks with chargers in U.K. so he is being rather disingenuous. https://t.co/mJsJhHIwC0
I didn’t. You did. You said we excluded Europe’s fastest selling EV. but as we only operate in U.K. your point was pointless https://t.co/ESsgaF0cRw
And what is Europe’s fastest selling EV? And what is U.K. fastest selling EV? https://t.co/54BiOVEvla
Exactly Unfortunately Ian from Darlington believes in dictatorial defence of all that he perceived as perfect with no possibility of question https://t.co/XLxkF1xLl1
Nope. We live in same world and nobody blamed NHS. You done more to damage NHS than most people though. https://t.co/KQaYwaIFnp
The word NHS has not been removed nor have I altered my tweet in any way. Don’t make things up to look clever. You aren’t https://t.co/weACn1U85v
I disagree and I am very happy that your accusation that anyone would needlessly blame the NHS has been found to be completely untrue &amp; without foundation https://t.co/Wie1geE8IY
A bit of an over reaction there. Calm down. I merely asked in order to get opinions. Nobody has suggested the NHS is to blame. https://t.co/2ebdaz1bKw
Who is mostly to blame here?  The NHS? Branson? Our existing government? Either way this is crazy https://t.co/hxZdBTXibT

How can he be a Muslim Migrant to a country if he was born in that country? https://t.co/l9A5qBmyDX
@Bladerunner954 @SirMustard There is evidence that at least one is not Muslim related but only the open minded reasonable people will want to see that
The fact that someone has a different opinion to you does not mean they think that you don’t count.  Silly boy. https://t.co/w3FnxujeS1
Sir. It is really the time for you to resign and go back to being a big time tough talking TV celebrity. When you do that the producers will be able to cover up your many mistakes and silly comments. Or maybe you could just stop tweeting? 🎥 https://t.co/ygTxpQUala
Great to hear that donations to @marysmeals are being doubled, up to £1.9m. With #DoubleTheLove your cash will provide even more meals for hungry children in school: https://t.co/KEAxOFq60y

One of my favourite charities, @marysmeals, is running a fantastic match-funding campaign: https://t.co/KEAxOFq60y Just saying!
That is so far from the point I was making. Which is this. If we give someone a jail sentence &amp; he or she serves that sentence &amp; is freed we should not go back yrs later &amp; say we are going to increase the sentence &amp; put them back in jail https://t.co/x1gIk7gIfw
To be fair it appears Robert Thompson has been rehabilitated and should therefore keep the anonymity that was promised to him if he stayed on the right side of the law. Jon Venables however is a different kettle of fish https://t.co/aQSb5nTGVr

This is a man supporting all MP's need got 2offices 5 staff and unlimited expenses. No wonder UK is bankrupt. https://t.co/dNXiMnfx7g
No I am suggesting every MP does not need 2 offices 5 workers and a Chaufer driven car https://t.co/OMdgz338gP
I don't think they need 2 offices each and 5 members of staff. https://t.co/kuFMBeT7dL
No MP needs £250,000 in expenses and 5 members of staff If all MP's did that what would it cost? https://t.co/oE1TTh57Fg
Well if every MP needs 2 offices and loads of staff that will be OK then won't it? NOT https://t.co/ctegq0bSnf

@sammon_james They should really be called family and disabled changing rooms.
I have double checked and there is a disabled loo and changing area in family change area. Really sorry you were not informed about it. https://t.co/PyqdvDSYkO
@sammon_james @Bannatyne @wnigora_nigora Let me just check the layout. It might have been built before we started adding family changing
@sammon_james @Bannatyne @wnigora_nigora Well I think you will find the disabled loo in family changing area. Do you use family changing area to shower/dress?
@sammon_james @Bannatyne @wnigora_nigora Are you a member?
@sammon_james @Bannatyne @wnigora_nigora I am sure there is.

It is not a crime to buy acid and carry it home on your moped. Which defence has been used https://t.co/gTwIHtwEAt
I agree. I hope they make an example of him and give him 30 years minimum. https://t.co/tMw2wdVO7m
Usually when someone blocks me it says "you are blocked from reading this account" This looks different. https://t.co/ALm2yIGjt0
I think it started when thugs discovered that carrying acid did was not a crime whereas carrying a knife, for example was. Also they could throw acid from back of mopeds to deter anyone trying apprehend them. https://t.co/8aJG0JaG9x
Has the person I was talking too just deleted their twitter account? https://t.co/4ssrddQMel
Her attacker is still in jail. (and may he rot there for another few decades) What do you think should have been done exactly? https://t.co/K1AMrdzwYP
I don't see your issue. Are you complaining that newspapers have not written about you? Or if not then what exactly is your problem? https://t.co/8bE0zOTV0c
Oh ok let's not bother now then 🙈 https://t.co/fSPBK6WRN3
Of course it is newsworthy as it gets the crime talked about. Why blame BBC though? Every TV network &amp; newspaper had reporters either in or outside court https://t.co/GYckwmeJPo
Of course it is worthy of breaking news status. There are acid attacks in our country almost every week and stackers must receive long sentences in prison if they are to be stopped. https://t.co/1SA1UFrM3p
