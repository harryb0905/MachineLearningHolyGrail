POEM#11‚Ä¶If it's out in space or in the back of my head‚Ä¶are we better off not knowing it!?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..THE END‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
POEM#11‚Ä¶It's not my fault it's just the way of the world, Said the Universe that knows that we're not here alone...
POEM#11‚Ä¶If you listen enough you can hear us all S.C.R.E.A.M, S.cience C.an R.elate E.quate A.nd M.ake you think?‚Ä¶.
POEM#11‚Ä¶It seems so simple that it's hard to believe, Said the planet to the vast amount of everything...
POEM#11‚Ä¶The twinkle of stars is the glint in your eye, As you make a creation to the masterpiece...
POEM#11‚Ä¶From womb to the tomb it's your own legacy, A belief is a secret of dishonesty...
POEM#11‚Ä¶It's better than luck that we're here till we die, As we float on this rock of holy alibis.
POEM#11‚Ä¶So tilt up your head and look up to the skies, There's more than a privilege behind our eyes.
POEM#11‚Ä¶If its in my face or in the back of my head, I'm better off not knowing it.
POEM#11...It's not my fault it's just the way of the world, Said the futuristic robotic neanderthal...
POEM#11...If you're pretty enough you can take all the C.R.E.A.M...C.ash R.ules E.verything A.round M.e...
POEM#11...It seems so simple that it's hard to believe, Said the microchip who downloaded it all for free...
POEM#11...A hundred beliefs but not one who believes, That your heart is a part of this technology.
POEM#11...Distract your attention with another ad, Another invention you can't live without...
POEM#11...The blade of the knife is the one thing you see, As they cut all the prices of your honesty.
POEM#11...It comes at a price but that's the novelty, Financial advice for dirty laundry...
POEM#11...It's not my fault it's just the way of the world, As the price goes up on the talentless souls...
POEM#11...If you're pretty enough you can take all the C.R.E.A.M...C.ash R.ules E.verything A.round M.e...
POEM#11...It seems so simple that it's hard to believe, Said the pages of your dirty rotten magazines...
POEM#11...A hundred beliefs but not one who believes, That the glimmering lights are blinding everything...
POEM#11...You can grab some attention if you shake your hips, A digression of ancient minds to luscious lips...
POEM#11...Is that a star in your eye or are you misunderstood, Will you be taking yourself off to Hollywood...
POEM#11...The gravity pulls as you take a bow, The talk of the town as you please the crowd...
POEM#11...If it's in my face or in the back of my head, I'm better off not knowing it.
POEM#11...It's not my fault it's just the way of the world, Said the scientist who tried his best to break the mould...
POEM#11...If you're pretty enough you can take all the C.R.E.A.M...C.ash R.ules E.verything A.round M.e...
POEM#11...It seems so simple that it's hard to believe, Said the astronaut that thought that space and time were free...
POEM#11...A hundred beliefs but not one who believes, When we look to the stars and the galaxies...
POEM#11...It's in your head but it's not in your heart, Because in the end there's a better start...
POEM#11...When clarity fuels all that you can deceive, When you look to the future it's embarrassing...
POEM#11...It's new and improved and a sign of the times, You can replace and remove all your 'laughter' lines!...
POEM#11...If it's in my face or in the back of my head, I'm better off not knowing it...
POEM#11...It's not my fault it's just the way of the world, Said the priest to the cynic and the animals...
POEM#11...If you're pretty enough you can take all the C.R.E.A.M...C.ash R.ules E.verything A.round M.e...
POEM#11...It seems so simple that it's hard to believe, Said the 'poet' to the 'know it' all that laughed at me...
POEM#11...A hundred beliefs but not one who believes, You're calling it 'faith'...I call it 'anarchy'...
POEM#11...A miracle mind or the evil truth? A spiritual home for the damaged youth...
POEM#11.....The Way Of the World (Climb Aboard)

POEM#10...Your decisions and opinions are just so hard to take, When they come from the hand that i'd never shake!...
POEM#10...Our Soules protect us from the shit Arse Holes dish out, They're asleep, Did they make their mark? Were they ever awake?...

POEM#10.. (Chorus) These are all the things that make the world go round, Even if the Devil wants us dead...
POEM#10..Here's a simple observation that i'd like you to know, We're all living in the middle of a FREAK SHOW!...
POEM#10..When a sentimental Presidential war of the worlds, Is like an independent rent a friend you never could own...

POEM#9......It takes a man to make machines!....(THE END)
POEM#9..Yeah why don't you just listen? As you prey down on your knees, It takes a finger to push the button...
POEM#9..Then why can't you just listen? Said the man to the machine, If you're a saint or a magician you've got a few tricks up your sleeve!
POEM#9..If you're living high and mighty or just a player in the show, If you're from this solid world or from a broken home..
POEM#9..It just seems so unlikely that we're out here on our own, To be up for the fight is not the problem solved..
POEM#9..A local anti social mistaken identity, A panic as we battle to find air to breathe..
POEM#9..A Holy Book a Dirty Look, the filthy and the clean, A tragic intervention means that we're the Enemy..
POEM#9...'So Why don't we just listen'? said the Man to the Machine, If you're a Saint or a Magician you've got a few tricks up your sleeve!
POEM#9...A Hocus Pocus Joke as we all point up to the sky, The Guns are ringing out!...as we all live then die!...
POEM#9...From Cyanide to London Pride we'll burn the city streets, A Cloak and Danger knife attack as great minds meet...

POEM#8..We're the Kids of this City, The Kids of these Streets, Gonna be in it to win it if you know what I mean...
POEM#8..Whose got the Tunes and who's that snorting the Gear? And who the F#@K invited you around here!!!...
POEM#8..Adam brought the Smokes (although he gave up last year), While Crispy and Beano talk about the Future...
POEM#8..Peggers brought the Bottle and you know that it's time, It's 6.00 in the morning so lets open the Wine...

POEM#8..We're The Kids of the City, The Kids of these Streets, Gotta be in it to win it if you know what I mean..
POEM#8..We sleep through the Day and we come out when it's Dark, The Children of this Town are on the War Path..
POEM#8..We've all shed a Tear and we've all had a Laugh, And we've all got the Fear as the Sun's coming up!...
POEM#8..If the World is our Stage then we've all played our Parts, We've killed a few Brain Cells and we've broken some Hearts..
POEM#8..Yeah we're the Kids of this City...The Kids of these Streets!..
POEM#8..(Chorus) We're the Kids of the City, The Kids of these Streets, Gotta be in it to win it if you know what I mean..
POEM#8..And then Morning Despair as the Alarm starts to ring, Help! What did I do? And who the F##k was I with??..
POEM#8..Then a 'Sniff' of the weekend and the grinding of teeth, And the talking of Shit to all the people we meet..
POEM#8..So I walk in the park and then I drink on the hill, As we toast the High Times that are just making us ill..
POEM#8..There's Pranksters and Gangsters and Rude Boys and Theives, And that Knife in your hand could take the Shoes off my feet...
POEM#8..So Batten Down the Hatches as we all 'Scream and SHOUT! The Kids of this City are all out and about!..
POEM#8..It's a Freaky Display with so much money to loose, Or a Trendy Affair for all the blaggers and fools...
POEM#8..It's about who you are it's not about what you do, So don't let this city come and swallow you..
POEM#8..If you're trapped in the Crack or you're just choking on Smoke, If you're from Foreign Lands or you're a local Hero..
POEM#8...So this is a 'Shout out' to the people we know, Cemented in the walls of this concrete jungle..

LYRIC#7...(And it goes) You're Money or your Life? Well that's up to you, but I hope you know 'The Jokes on You!'...
LYRIC#7...To all you Holiday Makers and Asylum Seekers...YEAH THIS IS OUR ISLAND IN THE SUN!!!!!...
LYRIC#7...Competition Winners and all you Two Bit Singers...Just smile and be happy that you got this far...
LYRIC#7...Cashing in a wasted dream, We'll do it all for charity...You've won a 'New Life' and a 'Brand New Car'...
LYRIC#7...Paparazzi Tragedy, a 'Has Been' to 'Her Majesty', The Sun is Mirrored Daily in a Star!...
LYRIC#7...Anorexics with Facelifts, Are you on the Guestlist??...This towns not big enough for the both of us!...
LYRIC#7...To all the Health Kicks and Addicts, Religious Fanatics... A Suspect package then a Broken Heart!...
LYRIC#7...To all the Misfits and Rich Kids, To Fame and to Showbiz...yeah you don&#39;t know how funny you are!...
LYRIC#7...Who's teaching the preaching and political thinking?...Well you don't know how funny you are!...
LYRIC#7...And i'll cut you with a knife if you don't make some noise, It's 'The Ballad of the Tragic Toys'...
LYRIC#7. And it goes...You're money or your life? Well that's up to you, But I hope you know the 'Jokes on you!'...
LYRIC#7...If there's a puchline to a joke then really i'm not fussed, Coz the only thought I know is that we think too much...
LYRIC#7...The difference in the beliefs that we all learn to trust, To the equality of our bones as we turn to dust...
LYRIC#7...And i'll cut you with a knife if you don't make some noise, It's The Ballad of the Tragic Toys!...
LYRIC#7. (Chorus) And it goes...Your money or your life? Well that's up to you, but I hope you know the Jokes on you!...
LYRIC#7...And in the ever changing way that we all ask for help, A tragic ending to a game? Or just a playful joke?...
LYRIC#7...We carry on and try to pick up on our mental health, Coz we only seem to play the cards that we've never been dealt...
LYRIC#7...And in the ever changing world that we don't understand, We all try to laugh it up so that we don't break down...
LYRIC#7...So here's a little song that I wrote, It's made of melodies and memories of words that i've spoke...
LYRIC#7...'The Ballad of the Tragic Toys'
LYRIC#6...You're the Answer, I'm Paranoid, Yeah you're the thing...I must Destroy!...... (THE END)
LYRIC#6...You're the Extreme, i'm the Rage, You're the Reason I Misbehave...
LYRIC#6...You're the Ying and i'm the You, You're the Thing that i'm Into...
LYRIC#6...You're the Anarchist, i'm the Pretend, You're the Addict, I'm on the mend...
LYRIC#6...You're the Accident, i'm the Fraud, You're Innocent, i'm the Bored...
LYRIC#6...You're the Love i'm the Liar, You're the Fever, I'm the desire...
Lyric#6...The cry came from a poet who was lying in the dirt, And although you'll never know...well this is what he heard...He said...
Check out my musc TRAGIC TOYS first article in W Magazine...http://t.co/Zx53PhQ
LYRIC#6...He asked for the Almighty to give a holy sign, But as he stood there waiting he just heard a distant cry...
LYRIC#6...His thoughts were getting clearer which made him more afraid, Was he a true believer of any kind of faith?...
LYRIC#6...(Chorus) This is how it feels when you feel so small, And the world outside your window isn't what you thought it was...
LYRIC#6...A panic took him over but he never lost his cool, A mind that isn't sober is just unforgettable...
LYRIC#6...He slowly started thinking as the knife went to his throat, Was this the way the world ends or was this just a joke?...
LYRIC#6...The little tiny thinker went outside into the rain, To wash away the shit of all the things that they explain...
LYRIC#6 (CHORUS)... This is how it feels when you feel so small and the world outside your window isn't what you thought it was...
LYRIC#6...He couldn't stop the laughter though he wasn't so amused, He read the daily paper but he didn't like the news...
LYRIC#6...He quickly gathered up himself and then fell apart again, He tried to turn his head 'on' but ended up just 'off' his head...
LYRIC#6...A simple situation can look you in the eye, But not if all the knowledge is a question in disguise...
LYRIC#6...A little tiny thinker didn't know quite what to do, When pieces of his mind gave him no stable point of view.
LYRIC#6.....'Big Thoughts Little Thinker'.....(Tragic Toys)

Showreel done...http://www.lamediaworks.com/jimsturgess/
LYRIC#5....Call on the Loon     (THE END)
LYRIC#5. And i'll ask a lot of questions, the answer's in the clue. To impress the very best just simply...
LYRIC#5. So i'll go into hiding, it's what I always do. As i'm constantly reminding myself to be more like you...
LYRIC#5.....The Call of the Loon....
LYRIC#5. And when you can't tell yourself 'it's just the way of the world', They're calling and they're coming for you...
LYRIC#5. (Chorus) When the voices in your head can be heard, It's never easy when you're so disturbed...
LYRIC#5. A slice of self expression? Or an honest piece of truth? Or just an artistic impression of the foolishness...in you!
LYRIC#5. So i'll ask you all to listen because i'm not here to amuse, But you seem so fascinated in the screw that's coming loose...
LYRIC#5. So who's the schizophrenic when i'm every part of it? I'm the man who sold the world and i'm the boy who lives in shit...
LYRIC#5. So now i'm contemplating my selfish point of view, From the scripted words that I learn to the characters I choose...
LYRIC#5...The Call of the Loon.
LYRIC#5. And when you can't tell yourself its just the way of the world, They're calling and they're coming for you...
LYRIC#5. (Chorus) When the voices in your head can be heard, It's never easy when you're so disturbed...
LYRIC#5. Yeah I believe in lovers and I believe in friends but the test of self belief is what you count on in the end...
LYRIC#5. A wave of paranoia is washing over me as I reflectively inquire all the things that I believe...
LYRIC#5. A self inflicted outburst, a retreat into shame. A loathing sense of myself then a repeat of the same...
LYRIC#5....The Call of the Loon!...
LYRIC#5. And i'll dazzle you with madness that you'll all buy into. It's that sick and twisted feeling gonna come for you...
LYRIC#5. So I find myself a reason to justify myself, It's the only phony way I know to stabilize my helath...
LYRIC#5. A manic indecision, Why can't I just agree, that these problematic difficulties all come down to me...
LYRIC#5. Coz I am HALF of nothing, You're just FULL of the same. I point the finger at myself when there's no one else to blame...
LYRIC#5...'Call of the Loon'......(Tragic Toys)
POEM#4 COMPLETE!!!!! To read the full poem go to the beginning of my profile and read your way up!!!!
POEM#4...I guess we all need someone to look down on!
POEM#4...A Geek is all freaked where as I'm in control. Makes me feel special, lucky and strong....
POEM#4...So 'The Geek'...a man with no soul?? Makes me feel good..but then..i'm an arsehole!...
POEM#4...It was nice for a while to dream of being cool, but really it's fake...The fact that i'm a Geek I just can't escape!...
POEM#4...Maybe it's best I remain a Geek!...
POEM#4...My head they'll kick and my face they'll beat as i'm left there to die naked on the street!!!!...
POEM#4...I'll get bullied like before, tied naked to a post...
POEM#4...If I don't they'll work it out, they'll see that i'm weak! They'll see i'm not like them, they'll see... i'm a GEEK!!!...
POEM#4...Listen to Electronic Beats!...Sorry!...the word is 'Techno'...better get myself in there with the lingo!...
POEM#4...I'll start off by getting myself into drugs! Dress hip and trendy and hang out with thugs!...
POEM#4...I mean all that SHIT just drives me Insane!!!...It's time to reform...it's time...for a 'CHANGE!'...
POEM#4...I'm tired of talking about cars and planes, The latest computer and the fastest train...
POEM#4...I'll do anything me, I'm like that you know. I'm a Geek with Passion, i'm a Geek with soul. I'm ready for a bit of get up and go!..
POEM#4...I'm crazy!!! I'm wild!!! Better stop me now before I do something that wont make you proud!...
POEM#4...I'm mean surely you can't say that now I am boring, With an interesting factor like THAT to my story!...
POEM#4...Do you think that means we pass the test? Do you think that means we're like the rest?...
POEM#4...We're crazy infact, wouldn't you say? Shagging each other when we're not even gay!...
POEM4. We got a bit drunk and felt a bit randy, The girls wouldn't have us because we're Geeks so we took it on ourselves to be a bit Unique
POEM#4...WE F**ked each other!!!!! Plain and simply!!!!.....
POEM#4...WE!!!...
POEM#4...I shouldn't really tell but it's such a great story, WE....
POEM#4...Me and Phillip went out to a party, Drank on some beers...AND THEN WE!!!!...
POEM#4...I shouldn't really tell.....BUT!!!!.....
POEM#4...Both of them probably as bored as the other, So....how's your mother??...You're looking well...how was your weekend??....
POEM#4...To sit there with another Geek and talk about nothing! As they ask questions about the others week...
POEM#4...I wonder what it's like to be a Geek??...
POEM#4...                GEEK OR UNIQUE??
POEM#3...I can guarantee it will all end in tears, When you pick up that razor and shave your first beard!   (THE END)
POEM#3...So the lesson to all you fellas out there is 'beware of signs of facial hair'...
POEM#3...There are some who survive and there are some who don't, Whether the hair's on the chin or round by the throat...
POEM#3...You see every Boy has to shave his first whisker, And turn that whisker into a blister...
POEM#3...And as you lie on the floor looking up at the ceiling, You realise this moment is full of deep meaning...
POEM#3...Pretty soon you've lost about a gallon of blood, As you hit the floor passing out with a thud!...
POEM#3...You wash your face but it just keeps on flowing, As the panic inside you keeps growing and growing...
POEM#3...You scream for help but there's no one to save ya, As the blood starts to drip from the edge of your Razor...
POEM#3...So shocked at the sight of your own reflection, You're in serious need of some medical attention...
POEM#3...It's then you notice as you look in the mirror, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' staring back at ya'...
POEM#3...The blood starts to flow and the puss starts to burst, As you scream in pain now your face starts to hurt...
POEM#3...But somehow it doesn't seem that simple, When your Fifteen years old and covered in pimples!...
POEM#3...So with Razor in hand you start to begin, To glide that blade right over your skin...
POEM#3...You've seen the AD'S. How hard can it be? It looks easy enough...well that's what it seems!...
POEM#3...But pretty soon you're bought your first shaving kit..."Gillette The Best A Man Can Get"...
POEM#3...So proud you'll be of that small strip of Fuzz that under no circumstances will you shave it off...
POEM#3...You can wash your face with some soap and a flannel, But you'll never remove that six o clock shadow...
POEM#3...But that strip of dirt that sits under your lip is, infact the start of it!...
POEM#3...It starts when you're about 15, When your face just seems to look unclean...
POEM#3...Osama Bin Laden back to Francis Drake, The Beard is in there's no mistake...
POEM#3...From Abraham Lincoln to Fidel Castro, The Beard makes a man look strong and macho...
POEM#3...It's that thing that makes a boy a man, It's that thing you stroke when you have a plan...
POEM#3...This is a poem about a beard. It's that thing you grow to impress your peers...
POEM#3                           A POEM ABOUT A BEARD

JUST PUT ON OLD DEMO 'FIND THE CHIEF' UP ON MY MYSPACE x
POEM#2...I'm laughing coz it's funny!................It's as simple as that!    (THE END)
POEM#2..."He's laughing coz he's angry and he wants to get back!"....what?? I'm laughing coz it's funny you stupid old TWAT!...
POEM#2..."He's crying like a baby who is missing the womb"...eh?? I'm crying coz i'm sad and I know you cry too...
POEM#2...Don't turn my emotions into statistics for your theory, I'm angry because I hate him!...and sad because I am teary...
POEM#2...I know why we're here! It's to naturally laugh and to naturally cry...it's not to always analyse why...
POEM#2...You see we dream to get away from people like you! You're no one, you're nothing, you haven't got a clue!...
POEM#2...CU CU...SSSSsscientist!!!...I'm gonna give you my own analysis...
POEM#2...I LOVE YOU I said, It replied with a GRUNT, We got married, had kids who I taught how to HUNT...now analyse that you stupid old CU
POEM#2...But the creature I had fallen for wasn't quite a lady...It was 8ft tall, all smelly and hairy!!!...
POEM#2...And as I swung through the trees minding my own business, I turned to see a creature of such pure sweetness...
POEM#2...I dreamt I was in a jungle bare to the skin...(except for these leopard skin pants I was in!!!)...
POEM#2...An illusion of hope that can never be attained...that's a bit like a dream that I had one day...
POEM#2...Even a dream's not a dream in days like these, It's a 'Sub conscience reaction to your insecurities'...or...
POEM#2...There's an answer to everything it's all such a bore, No one has space to dream anymore...
POEM#2...Always on the rampage to find a conclusion to a question they've asked...it just causes confusion...
POEM#2...I think there's too much knowledge about, Some are so clever it's all spilling out...
