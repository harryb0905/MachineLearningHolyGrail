@apriliaken @LabourWomensNet @ayeshahazarika @angelaeagle @DawnButlerBrent I was agreeing with her - and you. it was the other tweets that followed that wandered off track
7) nicely put. #fightingsexism https://t.co/bpq3ysqcG3
6) this is a choice bit of trolling - misses the point of the conference, but impressed that time was taken to consider the issue if not entirely getting the point #fightingsexism https://t.co/RltGWozgVk
5) shame to just go for the insults #fightingsexism https://t.co/a6ZoYSZwci
4) Being FOR women is not about being ANTI men - this is just silly #fightingsexism https://t.co/XlEY3xbstX
3) Seriously! I think every political party is working hard to promote talented women so that they have the same opportunities as the men - no bashing needed #fightingsexism https://t.co/W8Ydm5ps5H
2) let's think about how many all maie panels there are and the disproportionate advantage this gives men everyday #fightingsexism https://t.co/v8f5zPYUJF

10) Every child deserves the chance to go to school and plan for a better future - and children caught up in conflict need it most. Join us on the journey to unlock their world in 2018 and sign the #SafeSchools petition today 📝: https://t.co/7PAmh2tnSA
9) In 2018 I also want to see #SafeSchools for girls. All over the world, girls are denied education due to risks to their safety – for some just the journey to school puts them at risk. 2018 should be the year every child can go to school safely.
8) I’m excited to celebrate the achievements of remarkable women from the UK and around the world on #IWD in March – a great opportunity to share ideas and actions to progress the journey to gender equality. 💪
7) Last year, @GBCEducation launched the Youth Skills and Innovation Initiative to help young people be ready for the jobs of the future. In 2018 they’ll release important recommendations for businesses to implement - with youth at the centre.
6) It will also be two years since international leaders made the promise to get every Syrian refugee child into school. This April’s Brussels conference is an opportunity to deliver a brighter future for the 500,000 children in need of schooling. #YouPromised https://t.co/6hg6q7XVJk
5) 2018 is the year of Argentina’s G20 presidency 🇦🇷 They will be taking forward the commitment of G20 leaders to #IFFEd - a new funding initiative that we believe will make the mission of getting every child in education by 2030 a reality 👏
4) Action is needed in 2018 to make schools safer for children. @theirworld is calling on the four permanent members of the UN Security Council - the UK, US, China &amp; Russia - who haven’t signed the #SafeSchoolsDeclaration to show leadership by joining the 71 nations who have. https://t.co/p5i36vUjwv
3) Humanitarian crises dominated headlines in 2017 but education’s share of aid in emergencies is still less than 2%. #EducationCannotWait can address this but needs to be fully funded in 2018 to continue its work &amp; expand to other affected countries.
2) This year I want to see real commitments to funding for #earlyyears ed from international leaders as a result of the #5for5 campaign. Their first chance to improve the lives of the world's youngest children? The annual Spring meetings of the World Bank &amp; IMF. #watchthisspace https://t.co/1CQJE10EVY
1) On February 2, @GPforEducation will hold a major funding conference - a chance for both donor &amp; developing countries to increase commitments to #FundEducation 📚
