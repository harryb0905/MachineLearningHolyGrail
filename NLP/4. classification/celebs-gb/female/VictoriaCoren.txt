@mccaffepj @BBCTwo Lol
@EmiliePW What a nice offer! But no dice, I never get any time off #caged
@MrsP1001 @BBCTwo Let’s just say we’ve not heard from the lion either.
@Soulstorm99 I like “butterknives”
@LeesonAntony @BBCTwo !!
@stuber @BBCTwo The word “usurper” is too little used in general.
@corkdancer @OnlyConnectQuiz Very impressive!
@AbigailBurdess @BBCTwo Thanks very much! The designer describes it as “carbon emissions grey”. xxx
Are you enjoying this lovely weather, or too frightened it heralds something daunting and apocalyptic? Ooh, speaking of daunting and apocalyptic, Only Connect is on tonight! 8pm, @BBCTwo.
@DGH_V3 Please. I have enough trouble keeping up as it is.
@headinabook22 I think she’s terrific in it!
@dfugallo One day, one day....
!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/j10Q2qKaRt
You know what should have been among the Best Picture nominees? Mamma Mia 2! That’s a really wonderful film. Where is it?!
@sarahpilates Haha they’re all your cats...
@caroldecker *Desperately*. I can promise it wasn’t for my own pleasure.
@FolkyJob A EUPHEMISM?! What would be worse?
I’ve just spent 20 minutes trimming the matted fur around a cat’s bum. It’s not even my cat. “That’s my good deed for the day!” I thought. Then my husband reminded me he needs a lift to Oxford.
@JamesHarkin @KomnataLondon Good to escape the foul weather, eh
@TheScottishMike .... and you’re considering the future of the relationship?
@StevenFGalloway @Bobbie_Print Excellent use of time.
@Stapes This is starting to read like the plot of A Star Is Born.
@JimFraserRae @bleavey1 YES IT IS.
@pipneed1 I think it raised about £7000, which is great, and we might do it again next year but no plans at the moment.
@agentmulder2016 @AdyRowdy @OnlyConnectQuiz - in the former case, well of course if you have eight clues remaining and put four of them in a group, by extension you are putting the other four in a different group.
@agentmulder2016 @AdyRowdy @OnlyConnectQuiz Well that’s if they solve the whole wall. I think/thought he meant in the situation where the wall resolves itself because they *don’t* solve it.
@Limberine If you can’t see it, I can’t explain.
@AdyRowdy @agentmulder2016 @OnlyConnectQuiz They get a point if they can say what the connection is, but not the point for finding the group.
@CathDavison64 @OnlyConnectQuiz @uni_challenge The big three.
@Dyson4Tea Well, quite.
@executiverocker What a beautiful world that would be.
This is my kind of tweet. https://t.co/EeBcoj9HGY
@HylandsHypno @NWmwaypolice They’re devoted public servants though. Perhaps in the case of really SEVERE middle-hogging anywhere in Britain, they head down in two cars and gently shepherd the miscreant aside like when airforce jets are scrambled round a hijacked 747.
@HylandsHypno @NWmwaypolice Haha are you actually reporting me to the police for middle lane hogging?! I’ve probably done that in my time, but this particular picture was not taken from my car. I *think* you must mean it as a joke though?; perhaps Northwest motorway police are friends of yours.
@sueknox66 Well you can see his point. They’re both terrifying.
@davidsheraton @leejackson196 Yes. Una Stubbs was watching open-mouthed.
@MichyHell @Karencamm1 @OnlyConnectQuiz Well I didn’t watch it... did it start with ten? If so, and it’s a sequence going forwards, the numbers you mention have already happened..
@TheMagistrate3 @lukerigg I’ve enjoyed this exchange tremendously.
@leejackson196 No no it’s not my line, it’s from I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue, the world’s greatest radio show! Probably written by the inimitable Ian Pattinson.
@1ordinarydad I can see you...
@EilidhScotland I THINK I CAN EVEN PRONOUNCE IT! But let's not go mad.
@robertd1981 @OnlyConnectQuiz No, it's a team game. When we have fully blind contestants they use a braille wall and screen. With colour blindness, we assume their team-mates will tell them.
@Karencamm1 @OnlyConnectQuiz Don't ask me, I don't understand any of it.
@kateweb Thankyou.. odd how some *want* to assume I took that photo myself, so they can be cross about it. Like there's not enough to be cross about in the world! Is that the obvious assumption? I wonder why they think I didn't tweet it at the time. I mean, once I had the phone out.
@andre_lefevre @EilidhScotland I think/hope Eilidh's message was being ironic!
@David_Flett I didn’t say I took the picture. But it’s never too soon to judge, is it?
This was the view over the M3 today. I was driving along thinking about Jeremy Hardy. RIP. https://t.co/gapTnLird6
@GreenishMumStA Well, thank you. I’m really glad you liked the book. It’s probably the thing I’m proudest of.
@jodi__duncan ! I don’t know where I got the things I’m wearing NOW.
@JonVincent1 @hugorifkind Fear not! I am chilled. Many people are making the same point/joke; it disturbs my Spock-like devotion to logic.
@JonVincent1 @hugorifkind Well... how realistic? I mean.. they *don’t* strike in favour of global warming, do they? And it would mean a day off school. So, no they wouldn’t!
@hugorifkind I like “self-important”. They’re children! Are they UN-important?
@williamalamble Ooh, that *is* good...
@JLasker3 I know... but I’m afraid I think not, there was some kind of unaffordable cost implication.
@Rishi_Rai_Photo @OnlyConnectQuiz !!! I definitely would have accepted that. @quizquizquiz
(I mean, that's six minutes more than I could do, but still.)
Very much looking forward to watching @claudiawinkle do this. I would have bet she could manage six minutes. We'll see. https://t.co/0rSRFXAIib
@ImogenEJ @BBCTwo Bingo
All the milk... All the orange juice... All Daddy’s beer... but what comes next? Find out on Only Connect, on @BBCTwo in half an hour!
@bet72 Well, quite.
@molesworth_1 That’s a pretty good rule of thumb.
Why are the washing symbols on clothes labels so tiny? I seem to spend my life peering at them angrily. Do most people sort their laundry using some sort of JEWELLER’S EYEGLASS? #AllrightGrandma
@ZitahM @PavlovsTortoise No great mystery there: I need glasses to read the autocue which is quite far away, but I need to take them off to read the note cards on the desk which are very near!
@ZitahM Nice wood burner.
@tomhallett22 Not at all! I’m sorry we didn’t have more to offer - bad timing, long days at the writing table! - but maybe in the future, in the meantime good luck with all your adventures.
@jamesvogl I would NEVER HAVE GOT THAT. Well played x
@GwilliamIan Well the second line is certainly fair.
@RicardoHCAFC @Tuckineddy @LizzieBGFrance @OnlyConnectQuiz Thank you for your attention to detail! I like him *every way there is*.
@balrogz @mrdavidjays @OnlyConnectQuiz Very good opener.
@JonandRoGilbert Congratulations!!
@DofE My pleasure! What an impressive group of youngsters, it was a delight to meet them.
@mrdavidjays @OnlyConnectQuiz Thank you, I like that summary tremendously.
@AislingCaffrey Thank you very much; it’s absolutely not my loss, it’s the loss of his wife and his daughter, his sister and family and his best friend. But I was very lucky to know him and like millions of people I feel heartbroken.
Jeremy Hardy was so special and brilliant and mischievous, a miracle of a person. I loved him a lot. He was so kind when my father died. My dad admired him enormously. It’s so sad.
@jane_kjane No, it’s because they invariably start with a T (The History of King Henry the Eighth, or The Life of etc)
@philricegrubb Don’t bet too much.
@ZBayatti @peteshallcross Stop it STOP IT
@TheFluffyDillo Pretty much everything I ever do is intended as a homage to that show.
@peteshallcross Don’t have nightmares...
@cr37053880 No, it’s not called Henry the Eighth, it’s called The Life of King Henry the Eighth!
@debskiandmonkey If only that trend had begun tonight.
@rajoca23 @9Teen60 @EternalNomad That is truly brilliant yet horrific.
@aphidman !! No, it’s there.
@Jools_Orca @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo Don’t give them ideas.
@EternalNomad That’s nice! I am married, which might make me non-ideal. But with those two hashtags, you can surely take your pick.
@weestretch She’s on sabbatical. Or, as some people call it, safari.
@hurricanehorton @BBCTwo That wasn’t me, that’s @OnlyConnectQuiz ! They just use a picture of me. I mean, we are almost as one but not quite...
@InThruTheWindow In my dream world I’d do it about 6pm but it seemed such a miracle to remember at all...
@ArabellaOlwyn ! We were in different rooms.
My goodness, what is that icy blast? Why, it’s the onset of Only Connect, tonight at 8pm on @BBCTwo ! Expect the shivers.
@artyfuckwit @JonnyDonahoe @OnlyConnectQuiz Would you sleep? So many adventures ahead! Literally everything that happens is a mind blowing new experience! He can’t be wasting time asleep! Don’t worry about missing TV, it’s all boring and pointless. Have fun, good luck, enjoy the crazed miracle.
@JonnyDonahoe @OnlyConnectQuiz THAT ALL SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL
@david_stainer @richardosman @sumudutweets That was uncalled for.
@Gackets Good question!
@BirraneMichael I did, I saw a lot of him. Very much missed.
@EEnderinWales You’re very kind
@pearcetrainings @HollyJWAuthour I'm sorry you've had a sad week. I hope you have a good weekend.
@1966FFC @BBCTwo I'm afraid the difficulty builds over the course of the series...
@Helen84729793 It would be a fruitless game. We'd all marry all of them.
@HollyJWAuthour Is that a real show? I didn’t see that! Was he helping them get wood?
@Bri_Puff ooh post-it notes, good idea.
@ajwillshire It cropped up in the last series *ahem*
@KarenBat1969 Wait, let me think...
@Kerry_Hayward24 @BBCTwo ...as I’m so frequently exclaiming.
Yes, that might have been the place to say something... Thank you for not blaming us; Only Connect covers a lot of ground, and when we recorded this episode, we couldn’t know that a new adaptation of a 150-year-old book would be on at the same time! https://t.co/lWGTfEVFBN
@KnellerAngela 😎
@will_anglais Oh just reassure him that no Brits do either.
What links "Fracture: Scottish Fantasy" and "Ostrich: Electra"? If you need more clues (and God knows the teams did) watch Only Connect, tonight at 8pm on @BBCTwo.
@bilsland_chris Delightful.
@JoashTaylor From five series ago? I don't remember what I just ate for lunch.
@ThisCranDell That’s nice! Thank you very much.
@BrexitPimpernel @moretalesfrom @tommykl96 @tomscott @onezeroronny I do not.
@jordlp46 Thank you, I enjoyed that.
@JVTomlinson @OnlyConnectQuiz I think they reconsider it literally every time I appear.
@moretalesfrom @tommykl96 @tomscott @onezeroronny But who could possibly do a better job than the people in charge at the moment?
@MrDean1863 !! She’s great.
https://t.co/mZYUjyjP94
https://t.co/UqxEf8xsG7
(Oddly, no speculation on whether Princess Diana arranged it).
This is magnificent in the Mail: *how Prince Philip might have looked at the scene*. https://t.co/Tj5BTaEI6Y
@MikeFlynn19 It’s supposed to be a challenging show! Nothing comes easy.
@Staffy_Beard I always am.
@artschoolwank Many feel the same.
@Handreijka HELLO
@bakerpictures I think fast. Ask my poker opponents.
@peter3day I think that’s a different thing?
@Allymcpook @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo I’m sure we will get round to it eventually!
@Stoo1701 @BBCTwo And yet this suggests you frequently, regularly, repeatedly, keep watching until the end of the programme. Although the questions have finished. There’s nothing left but my closing words. But you can’t switch off. In a way, it’s your favourite bit of the show. I’m delighted.
@madame_jo_jo @BBCTwo Congratulations
@609Ellie @BBCTwo Too obvious.
Tonight's Only Connect features a reference to the village of Ytterby, one of the all-time great quiz villages! And a phenomenal music sequence, well done everybody! 8pm, @BBCTwo
@tantramancan Ahh I wish I was...
@lizzyf101 Yes, the recipe came out very well!
@pfrr That looks very good - although this tin was 400ml which was exactly what I needed!
@NoIsco_NoDisco @Shiskine It’s a sort of vegan dauphinois thing. We’ll see.
@richardosman That is certainly the best cookery tip I’ve had so far.
Excellent! Thank you, Question answered. There are enough replies to qualify as a consensus. Very grateful x
@chrisoliversyd Is it? Why?
I don’t know why I said that’s dumb. Should I be expected to know all about tinned coconut milk? What am I, a PROFESSIONAL VEGAN CHEF?
Dumb question alert: I’m about to cook something using tinned coconut milk. This is new to me. Would you expect to open the tin and find a lot of cream at the top, so it has to be mixed back together (like cow’s milk sometimes does) or does that mean something’s wrong with it?!
@chris_c_johnson @dan_c_warren @cjyork96 @OnlyConnectQuiz It doesn’t work like that; a team of people submit questions months earlier, then edited/collated by question editors. Those people aren’t in the studio, there are no writers at all in that sense! The contestant stuff is of course not invented anyway. They’re biographical facts!
@chris_c_johnson @dan_c_warren @cjyork96 @OnlyConnectQuiz What writers?
@Acadarchist Thank you very much!
@diana11debbie I think it will be! At any rate there'll be cake and quiz questions, what more is there?
@onepau Well how nice. If you mean to help you navigate my book, is there not a glossary at the back...?
@david_stainer Thank you! Happy new year.
@david_stainer Haha you absolutely mustn’t! Too cruel to the regular punters. We’ll have a more challenging one another time ..... 😎
The charity pub quiz sold out yesterday, but apparently they were able to put one more table on sale this morning, so anyone who missed out last night you might get it now!
@IanMDunnett @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo Ooh, I think you’re right - and it is!
@matfrankland1 @SimonBaker23 Ah, sorry! Have a great trip.
@SimonBaker23 @matfrankland1 Is Matt Frankland a quizzer? I had no idea!
@car0linensis Sure of course! I like the sound of them.
Wealthy London triv fans! I'm hosting this charity pub quiz on February 7th. It's small, bespoke and expensive (£50 per person/ £300 for a quiz team) but if you enjoy quizzes and you have spare cash, it's a BRILLIANT charity and I think will be fun. https://t.co/tVkR6LvHq8
@portlysmum I thought they disappeared years ago! I don't know, sorry... try @onlyconnectquiz?
@CJABradbury Me? I struggle to pass a pair of eights.
@cambridgerider WE ARE NEVER ON LISTS. THIS IS SUBVERSIVE QUIZZING.
@MUTiser2 Lovely!
@eleanor_ayres You should ask if they’ve considered putting them in the SAME CUPBOARD. Imagine the efficiency!
@AndGarth You’re telling me.
@RufusHound Oh lord. My own jokes as well! You understand it’s the *terrible contrivance* I’m laughing at, there’s nothing self congratulatory in it. Having said that, a friend told me tonight MP is in Alaska, and I had a magnificent idea for his new series on moose hunting. That’s... xx
@loobeyloobey @exitthelemming These modern kids, they think they INVENTED “interactive”.... https://t.co/cY7jZvCYVi
@exitthelemming You’re very kind ... x
@exitthelemming https://t.co/3cY79lxkFy
@Shillibier They’re baffled enough.
@hyenalounge Low risk. They’re never invited anywhere except here.
@mattwildin I completely understand.
@nickovdw I mean basically yes.
Two of the players in my Tuesday poker game have swapped seats after many years in this configuration. Now they’re all over the place. Too hot, too cold (“It’s draughty down here!”), betting out of turn, forgetting where the action is. God help them after Brexit.
@Ben_Broadribb Nobody listens ... nobody listens ...
@worthycab @ChrisPhilpot Oh that rings a bell! Yes exactly - that's a much more intricate connection. If someone had guessed W or H (for weir/heir), in a lenient mood I'd have asked them why that particular word, to see if they could give me a brilliant rationale... but otherwise no, much too random.
@ChrisPhilpot No.. I mean.. just a random four-letter word spelt backwards would not be enough to make it in as a question to the programme, it would have to at least spell QUIZ or something like that. But was this a question in the show? What was the answer?!
@fogarelli1 *sigh*, can’t believe I got that wrang.
@fogarelli1 You’re nae rang.
@robbiemitch2 I’m afraid I didn’t watch it so have NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. I didn’t even remember it was on!
Oh hang on.... Only Connect was on wasn’t it....? damn, I remembered to tweet about all of them all through Christmas! And it was on practically EVERY DAY! Oh well. If you missed it and that’s down to me, then if you’ve got any sense you’ll be grateful anyway.
@MattofWalker @karenmayt @OnlyConnectQuiz I wonder how many times I'd have to watch them through before I scored 100%. I suspect it would be in triple figures.
@karenmayt @OnlyConnectQuiz Well, sure! I mean, it’s all for the audience at home’s benefit! It’s a TV show!
@hermalern Happy birthday!
@HyggeJem @OnlyConnectQuiz I’m sorry about this. A few others have mentioned it – the blonde thing – I haven’t had this confirmed yet, but from the tweets I think we might have shown the wrong picture and I do apologise!
@JayneCallan I’m always hungry.
@Vanblerkisms @TweetMRS Yes, that would be a terrible thing to put in the advertising. Much better keep it as a surprise on the night.
@TweetMRS Oh that’s a relief, thanks for replying! Yes great if you could amend the wording in that flyer.
@TweetMRS Hello... I’m a bit confused by this, I don’t think I’m due to be a keynote speaker anywhere! Is this the event where I’m coming to be interviewed? I’m a bit worried this leads people to expect a speech, which I won’t be giving!
@NerdSStockin Well, no good deed goes unpunished! Hope your mum feels better soon.
@RevLMD I didn't say it was over. I said it was *basically* over. I know a lot of people use that word (like "literally") as a sort of invisible placeholder that means nothing at all, but I'm not one of them. It's like saying "At 19, your teens are basically over". Not the same as over.
@radioruderham But it just needed to be any group with five siblings in it. There were still five siblings in The Jacksons!
@SScaddan @Quiconque Yes.. people have been troubled by that tweet! But the "basically" was supposed to mean, from January it *feels* over, even though it isn't. Certainly still being celebrated with gusto (and decorations and food) in this house...
@b8sey @DrKateWhittaker That’s not one of the six!
@edburrows That was your first dance?! Aw... it sounds like a happy story, I’m glad!
@ShaunJClarkson @Psephizo IT DEFINITELY SHOULD  Hurry up, I think applications are nearly closed! @OnlyConnectQuiz
@DrKateWhittaker - But isn’t that the one whose first chapter contains the line “Catherine began to curl her hair and long for balls” ? I certainly found that memorable at school.
@DrKateWhittaker It’s the obvious one to forget.
@ElaineGreen17 🍾
@wallie17 Me too!
@tweetierach Me....?
@just_jesshere Happy birthday!
@Audere2010 I live in hope.
@barryghodgson And that means he doesn’t share their surname?! Cruel adopters...
@RichRance I’m assuming you’re at, you know, the South Pole.
@kouya I mean, it’s the key to the whole programme.
@sorrento_gina Oh, I expect so. I don’t remember specifically but it was, as so often, online for about eighteen quid.
@DocCrom Well, I suppose it depends what effect you’re looking for.
@DaveChallender I mean that is definitely a health drink.
@allisonpearson A mystery! But it may be the reassuring nature of print. Delighted to hear that was his present, by the way. https://t.co/SS0FoGPf8d
@PhotoPaul67 Oh both. It’s a holiday.
@JuneSchofield2 It’s not! This is Tuesday! We’re usually on Mondays! It’s all topsy turvy!
@MrsGibson QUITE
@james_findlater But that’s what “basically” meant. It isn’t actually over. It just starts to feel like it.
Christmas is basically over. Dry January has begun. A cold snap is coming. And to cap it all, Only Connect is on tonight.
@Lou_Bookmarks @BBCTwo Careful what you wish for! There’s more OC this very night...
@CJABradbury @OnlyConnectQuiz Thank you! Sorry about the film. It otherwise sounds wonderful...
@bobbyjones007 @BBCTwo No, we were never on tonight! If something’s been replaced, it was a film.
@AndrewSpiers I’m not allowed within 200 metres.
@keiththecamel You too xx
@_Bleam Well I guess you would take the cork out during the opening credits, and start drinking.
No Only Connect tonight, although it’s technically Monday. I think, given the date, they feared driving people to *too much* drink.  Our normal series continues TOMORROW at 8pm on @BBCTwo, and then I think we’re back to Mondays from next week.
@joeheenan @fabulucy @GlennyRodge @bazlyons @ItsAndyRyan @ChrisHewitt @AndieDelicacy @mand_brun @QuebecTango @ThenJoSaid @johnnycandon @JaneyGodley @TheCheish @Simon_Pegg @rickburin @Yippieeeeee https://t.co/Cu4KCrQ6yF
@77wonder No, we were never meant to be on tonight!
@ringoroses Surely not! There are enough difficult questions at a wedding already...
@Darcy_221B @RealDMitchell You’re not kidding.
@jane_kjane But why century? Why not, say, decade?
@Ben_Broadribb @ParasolMedia @OnlyConnectQuiz Well that’s very nice to read! Thank you, lovely to meet you all.
@Amandamoo1973 @EmmingEmma Merry Christmas!
@JasonSweby @OnlyConnectQuiz !! Merry Christmas.
@Rylan @OnlyConnectQuiz Hurray! Consider all future episodes addressed DIRECTLY TO YOU.
@sarahrogers8855 @BBCTwo I think it’s here   https://t.co/Nhn1bEpmAm
@Gavhuds Lol
@57glasgowgrant @BBCTwo Thank you very much! Merry Christmas.
@BbCrumble It’s not mine, the production bought one, sorry!
@tweetierach They won’t mind! It’s Christmas!
@eileenrogan19 @BBCTwo Thank you!
@mariamcerlane @BBCTwo Isn’t she though? Unless you mean the film ET, which also is. Merry Christmas!
@MartGray @OnlyConnectQuiz But why is that a sequence....?
@Sathnam Oh that’s nice! Thank you, merry Christmas x
@branch_tracey @BBCTwo Thank you! Yes she was.
@Cathvallely The production got one!
@DavidDag5 Oh dear! Sorry about that...
@Corabal @BBCTwo Oh that’s a shame! Must be rugby....
@bobbyjones007 Yup, it really got me.
@bobbyjones007 Not sure if you mean the documentary or the film, but they’re both from about five years ago.
@genecowan @BBCTwo Nearly!
@kriswhoosh @BBCTwo Oh lord no. It’s Boxing Day.
At 1.30pm today, @BBCTwo is showing a documentary I made about PL Travers, author of Mary Poppins, followed by the film Saving Mr Banks in which Emma Thompson plays Travers and Tom Hanks is Walt Disney. It’s a very good film, I think. And I’ll be flying in the documentary... ☂️
@Morgan_T_Brown @chrissieranson Actually no. I must take after the other side.
@Steve_J_I @BBCTwo Sorry! Too late!
Merry Christmas!  I notice Strictly Come Dancing is on BBC1 today at 5.35pm. So if you like to see clumsiness, embarrassment and real physical pain, why not turn over to BBC2 for Only Connect?  #OnlyConnect #QuizSpecial 5.35pm, @BBCTwo
@clumsy1974 I bet! That’s very impressive.
@FloellaBenjamin Oh that looks brilliant! Merry Christmas! xxxxxxx
@SheenaLeith That sounds magnificent.
@CraneMultimedia 👁
@chrissieranson My grandma was Hungarian. She spoke *very* like Yoda.
@IdRatherBeAtT I don’t remember anyway! It wasn’t meant to be festive, it was the summer!
@jenlion @OnlyConnectQuiz Merry Christmas!
That's it! Done for the night; Only Connect is back tomorrow at 5.35pm on BBC Two with a "Quiz Special", which sees a couple of favourite teams returning for a very jolly show.
@cgma_ciara @OnlyConnectQuiz A lot of people are telling me this! Sorry... I don't know where the picture came from!
@just3nita I think it was a joke...
@JAJRobertson Ooh... I'm outside my comfort zone there I'm afraid...
@pdcawley Thank you!
There she is! Well done everybody who got this earlier today when I only gave you two clues.
@HairThief 😉
@lushattic Isn't it? We've got a special on tomorrow and that's not Christmas themed either. #Contrary
@kevinkingradio 🍾
@L3GSV @keithwrjones Would she not even accept that I've given them Christmas off? Am I SCROOGE?
@keithwrjones @L3GSV WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? I NEED THEM
@Mr_RichB IT'S A GOOD OMEN
@HavTuf I mean.... 8 o'clock on any night...
It's exactly the kind of answer he'd invent, when talking about this frustrating programme.
Oh yes, I remember this question. I think it will make @mrmarksteel laugh.
... *before* they get befuddled by drink and chocolate? Please! It's 8 o'clock already!
@ClaraStKilda Cheers!
I think I might celebrate Christmas Eve by WATCHING Only Connect. Well, that and polishing off this bottle of Tia Maria. May I advise: they make an excellent combination.
@andrew_scobbie I wouldn’t have thought so.
@oliverschraylor Very hard to sum up in a tweet. I had mixed feelings!
@BuffaloGregNY @Sturdygirl0803 Or the unluckiest. I mean, all the ones with quads and straight flushes must have been really disappointed to lose.
@Sturdygirl0803 I wish I was at that game. They’re all clueless.
@glass_kites I’ve done ones where it feels like half an hour of them.
@martingerrard75 Round 2.
@TCKemp @BBCTwo See if you still think that after you’ve seen it.
@Sandals_ajw Yes: that I started drinking Tia Maria when I woke up this morning.
@Astrojg @BBCTwo Why 32?
@mcmwright @BBCTwo A sequence.
@blueshirtdistin Lol
@Samiieface It is not!
M17: Northern Ireland   That’s the second clue. Good luck!
M1: WALES  ....is the first clue in my favourite question from tonight’s Only Connect. There’s a special tomorrow at 5.35pm but tonight it’s the normal contest.  Well...  I say normal...  #OnlyConnect 8pm on @BBCTwo
@downtondreamer @sheIaghturnova Happy birthday!
@exitthelemming Well I’ve done yours.....
@ShazzBakes @MaddieMad_un @Midgetgems26 @sueperkins It's a drink made entirely from lawyers.
@photogfrog I hope Santa Claus is listening 😎🎄
@GrittyKit Oh good! HGD!
@kaulomengri Lovely! Thank you, I enjoyed that story.
@nidgescoot50 One neck is longer than the other.
One more Only Connect special this week: the lovely FAMILY special! Oh, it's awfully jolly and warm. A glittering array of Lasletts and Trimbles will gather to ponder, quiz and, if we're lucky, sing.....  ....at 7.30pm on BBC Two.
@greycowboy Can’t risk it - I am too!
@n1artisan Well that’s very nice of you.
@Gary_P_Jackson You’re not kidding.
@RabbiGlenLevy It SHOULD be...
@Gcuth1 But that’s nothing.
@jamesianosborne Give it time 😎
@EmTheSquarePeg Hahahaha
@dadwroteaporno @jondrytay Ooh excellent, thank you very much! Will listen later.
@necrofamicom Meh, I’m a gambler. I hang around with a lot of them.
@jondrytay But you have to send me some sort of link. It’s like your message is in CODE. I am NINETY. I can’t work a MICROWAVE.
@jondrytay @dadwroteaporno Really??? I want to hear it!
@bantam79 Good luck!
Actually it can’t have been more than 6 years ago because I’ve noticed the byline says Mitchell; I didn’t start using my husband’s name before we got married since, as the piece says, you don’t want to look too keen.
This is genuinely quite good sex advice, from about [7?] years ago which I’d forgotten I wrote. I agree with myself. https://t.co/BHRQavxhFa
@Samiieface Cleanse your palate with tonight’s lovely “family special” !
@lesleymack The perfect place to listen!
@nicolahunt987 👏👏👏
@TimDownie1 @FloellaBenjamin @RealDMitchell Aw
@festeringbaboon Yes! She is THOROUGHLY NICE!
@northoxford It’s not even me.
@molpole That’s very good.
@natjdavis @BBCTwo The whole show seems longer.
@a4alison11 There’s another tomorrow!
@Bennett1Rebecca Thank you! But it was easy, she’s so sweet and silvery to talk to.
@MaaikeMilligan Too good.
@Hillsangel OMG I have no advice for her at all
@NicholaJeans Thank you!
@LeyNathan @BriSmithy @BBC Good to hear! 🚲 🍾
@grahamtriggs You’re not wrong
@fardys Happy Christmas!
@SteveHyett Beautiful, isn’t it?
@Pheebs12 Wasn’t she!
Oh I'm such an idiot!! I remembered the Only Connect special and FORGOT last in the series of Women Talking About Cars! Our final guest was the wonderful Una Stubbs, who was sweet and surprising and hilarious - I massively recommend this show:  https://t.co/MprpcFZIBM
@deltoidpaul WELCOME
ANOTHER Only Connect special tonight! Will this gruelling week never end? It’s the sport special, 7.30pm on BBC Two! ⚽️🏀🏈🏸🏏🏑🥊
@GJamesduff It would sink so fast, you wouldn’t have time.
@sfw_angtft @SchrodiesCat It’s all technique.
@yasminwilde @FloellaBenjamin GENUINELY it’s about a sort of inner goodness. Lady B shines from the inside like a Christmas lantern.
@yasminwilde @FloellaBenjamin I was shouting that question in my sleep.
@deshouse227 That is excellent back-up information.
@bigmaddog1 @BBCTwo But that doesn't mean it isn't a song about a car. It just means it's *also* about something else.
@SchrodiesCat I usually decide. If I'm not sure what I think, I stop the recording and ask what others think. Occasionally, I'm sure but the exec or question editor thinks I'm completely wrong, in which case *they* stop the show, we have a quick arm-wrestle and the winner makes the ruling.
@FloellaBenjamin Thank you so much, we absolutely loved it xx
Lots of Only Connect specials on this week! But tonight, the normal contest continues to the *second chance saloon*, where two losing teams meet and only one can now survive. Metaphorically speaking. Nobody gets killed. I hope that’s not a spoiler. #OnlyConnect  8pm on @BBCTwo
@AdyRowdy Ooh, we’re going to have a LOVELY chat about a Fiat 500 on next week’s show...
@DerrySketcher @robdoylecouk It doesn’t really work that way. We’re not the BBC, we’re a production company in Cardiff, making *for* the BBC. UC is made by totally different people!
@frankcottrell_b @feistywomankent @jodiecomer I don't think LLP is on Twitter but yes she is wonderful, isn't she?
@RoyalBlueStuey That's incredibly nice of you, thanks very much.
@sehartsmith You're welcome! Merry Christmas!
@sehartsmith Excellent pedagogy!
@LuluFettes Oh that IS weird! The exact anniversary! @QuizQuizQuiz @OnlyConnectQuiz
@jpaul1981 @BBCRadio4 Yum yum.
Tonight on Women Talking About Cars, I’ll be discussing murder, motherhood and Rolls Royce Corniches with the fantastic Lynda LaPlante. 6.30pm on @BBCRadio4 https://t.co/lMITg8KLbv
@foneguy65 @jennyjustjenny Ah, I am in a constant state of reverence for the antidote you mention. The sun that shines on us all.
@greenheaddesign Most nights do.
@super_nic_ebob I do that every week.
@Markiswin Oh NICE hashtag.
@jennyjustjenny It's lovely of you to say so. I always appreciate tweets saying that; helps balance out the hundreds that say it's the worst bit....
@GillyGreenhill That's nice! Thank you. And I like the sound of the miniature heraldic knights enormously.
@joshgroban Neanderthal? While watching Only Connect and eating sticky toffee pudding? I can hardly picture a more civilised scene.
@michaelsville God no, not by a long chalk.
@JudithClare2 Arrghh! The plate!
@abbas_panjwani I’m haunted.
@AlanMac9 I make notes! Blimey! I don’t even remember my own door number.
@Pablito999 I mean, basically. But by mistake.
Tonight on Only Connect, look out for the question which starts with flowers and fruit, then see if you can figure out why I was relieved they didn’t guess after two clues! #filthy (8pm, BBC Two)
@KamilaKingstone Aw thank you for remembering! But no. Maybe next year.
Yes! It’s a ho-ho-honly Connect! https://t.co/dqrhSopNda
@stephbreakfast Aw thanks! Always have to be ready in case action breaks out 😎
@JudgeRoySnyder @OnlyConnectQuiz I think the music round is the hardest because - as well as identifying the pieces and finding the connection - you have to hold a lot in your head. A piece of music can’t stay up on screen like words and pictures!
@AntJarman @OnlyConnectQuiz Good luck! I hope to meet you anon...
@ringoroses Oh wow, that’s great! VERY cool card.
@beawalker123 @RealDMitchell In Peep Show he ate a dog.
@serenaDr00lz Ooh, nice nails
@SenseiChanning @Withnail160 @ferrifrump @BBCRadio4 Lol
@SJG99 I mean, you have to hope that 95% of people haven't.
Tonight on "Women Talking About Cars", the woman I'll be talking about cars with is the phenomenal @ferrifrump. That's 6.30pm on @BBCRadio4 !
@jamesaswilson1 If you want a really boring answer: we'd probably avoid having that category, because of precisely that problem. But, for the sake of settling your debate: no, I probably wouldn't.
@ThatCarterBlunt Ooh, it really could!
Aw.... who recognises this cute little feller? https://t.co/E8LBLmaJ8H
@denartha I don't think so, sorry...
@pammyd7 @OnlyConnectQuiz I don't need to find you one! You can apply by yourself and get matchmade!
@mufc44 @OnlyConnectQuiz It always feels like that in the early rounds of the series. Give it time.
@PaulT06645649 @OnlyConnectQuiz Aha! That's PRECISELY what I was referring to in my tweet earlier today. In fact we were only looking for the word "captain", but I yes I was expecting/hoping to see several viewers footnoting that Kirk himself was a captain of naval status. You're the first I've seen so far...
@david_armes Isn't she wonderful? I'm completely besotted.
@shr1k Oh maybe not. I'm thinking of a former contestant but there might be two!
@mags171124 @SenseiChanning Please. I wouldn't have had a penny on me.
@ashleysmith1982 Or you can always apply alone.........
@41below Well if that's your question, you might as well audition - it's kind of a free day out, and if they think you're an idiot I promise they won't put you on the programme!!
@F1tzy79 A true pedant could never have written the title like that.
@shr1k Is that you, Shri ?? I think it is..... but I'm not in charge of that, if it were up to me I'd say it's fine to come back if it was a brief visit, and perhaps not a whole returning team! email onlyconnect@parasolmedia.co.uk and they will know....
@CriticalAndroid Are You Being Served? It will always be a thing.
(Being neither of those things is not a pre-requisite for applying to the show. Star Trek fans and pedants are extremely welcome. But you could probably tell that).
If you're a Star Trek fan AND a pedant... well, I can only assume you watch Only Connect! And you may wish to point something out after tonight's show (8pm, BBC2). If you're neither of those things, but still spot the clarification I could have made, why not JOIN US NEXT YEAR? https://t.co/79YVGY0CCo
@CharlieNorfolk @FloellaBenjamin Oh, completely. She's utterly wonderful.
@Roselind46 @gilescoren The title was found by @ajohnduncan - it’s probably “I Blame The Dealers”, which is the penultimate piece in the compendium “Chocolate and Cuckoo Clocks”. But he might have used that device more than once!
@ajohnduncan @gilescoren @Roselind46 Oh well that will be it then!
@Roselind46 I’m afraid I don’t know! @gilescoren might know, he’s better at that than me, but there are just so many books.
@alanbretos Not such a beautiful image! But thank you. Proudly made in Splott, of course.
@Horseshoe0 You’re right! Thanks for sharing!
@oxygenthiefYEAH I’LL FIND IT
@Susannah_J @550LMS @melindiscott @rackandrule @MacchinaMedia @suzywolff Series 1? Dawn French is a car nut. Olivia Colman's a licensed rally driver. Germaine Greer drove a Holden alone across Australia. I don't know why you hate the show, but it really sounds like you haven't listened. Your right, of course! Sorry to annoy you. Have a good weekend.
@DaveW1701 @FloellaBenjamin IT'S IDEAL.
@Susannah_J @PtheP @melindiscott @rackandrule @MacchinaMedia I guess it was you saying "Features women being stereotypically useless" that made me think you were having a go at the guests. But perhaps you just haven't heard the programme! Try Jennifer Saunders next week. If you are into cars, I think you'll enjoy it.
@RugbyQuins @Granite_Beard I actually love cherry brandy.
@550LMS @Susannah_J @melindiscott @rackandrule @MacchinaMedia I couldn't fathom how Floella Benjamin, who was so intelligent and articulate on the programme, had come across as "stereotypically useless". It's certainly not about Floella's personality or performance. It's clearly about something else. I was just guessing!
@Susannah_J @melindiscott @rackandrule @MacchinaMedia Floella Benjamin is an extremely intelligent, informed and articulate woman who has a keen interest in cars and a hobby in motor racing. I do hope that isn't a bit of racism creeping in there from you.
@GIFTpeer_haven I never open the door. I live in there.
Here is the first episode of Women Talking About Cars (with wonderful @FloellaBenjamin) on the BBC iPlayer. Thank you for all your lovely messages about the programme.  https://t.co/hRE38hvNHd
@spcrawford80085 I'm afraid I think BBC rules make it UK-only. I don't know why! It's not like there are prizes! Let us know when you move here....
@SarahatSelf Thank you! Maybe I’ll try “fiction” again one day!
@isabellejpotts I don’t know about a podcast but it will be on BBC iPlayer or Radio 4 Listen Again.
@AmmennaTimelady @FloellaBenjamin Thank you too! Nice to hear from you  🍸
@Galaxandra79 Thank you very much! It was a lovely audience.
@Goldy73 @a4alison11 It’s actually called “I’ll Get This”.
@mistermoonchild @BBCRadio4 @FloellaBenjamin That’s incredibly nice of you to say.
@sdoddsy @Indiasign1216 That’s about the size of it. Plus, once all money is electronic, if and when they want to they can just switch yours off. You are trapped and powerless immediately.
@PhilippaHann @misssfitt @BBCRadio4 @FloellaBenjamin It is! Three more wonderful women to come: Jennifer Saunders, Una Stubbs and Lynda La Plante.
@RoyalBlueStuey @BBCRadio4 @FloellaBenjamin That's a really lovely thing to say, thank you.
@Nicklezard @FloellaBenjamin @BBCRadio4 Thank you very much! And I can only apologise for my ghastly suggestion.
@KiritPankhania Beautifully put!
@paulfcook It's a collaboration between @garethmammal, @pezzatronic and me. Made easy by Lady Benjamin's perfectly modulated speaking voice. it was a pleasure to do.
@Grow2Bee @BBCRadio4 Excellent work introducing that small person to Radio Four around the age I started listening myself. I hope it brings her a lifetime of treasure and pleasure.
@PhilippaHann @BBCRadio4 Hurray!
@Berkorichard @FloellaBenjamin We do, don't we? Thank you very much.
@bensutherland @BBCRadio4 @FloellaBenjamin Thank you! What a lovely message! I mean... I know it's Lady B you're talking to really, but I'm so happy to have been part of it.
@PM_BrianF That is very much the joke. Well done for getting it, even though you don't quite understand that you've got it.
The new series of *Women Talking About Cars* starts tonight at 6.30 on @BBCRadio4 with me, Sarah Hadland and fantastic first guest @FloellaBenjamin. Her story is amazing; it’s an episode I’m very proud of. https://t.co/fcztDsFueU
@RalfLittle @BuffaloGregNY Perhaps it was an audition!
@weirb4 I’LL TAKE IT!
@cheriebs THEY FIND US
@keiththecamel I mean, it’s time you got round to that anyway.
@keiththecamel Yes!!!!! Maybe you'll make an appearance? Which reminds me, I think you'll be cropping up on next week's Only Connect as well. In case I forget: 8pm, BBC2, Monday night!
@grumpitcol If only.
Here I am having dinner with Harry Redknapp, Martin Kemp, Joanna Scanlon and Rob Beckett as usual. This peculiar party will be broadcast on BBC2 tonight at 10pm. It was recorded a while ago: a starter for Harry, as it were, before the witchetty grubs. https://t.co/mXA18i19xA
@BuffaloGregNY Writers...? You may be misunderstanding the form.
@Utopia_Roxs If we made them up, that’s not what we’d say.
@alexpavlovic95 It is at any point.
@RogerMaybank It’s very difficult! You have to do at least three things!
@JRBatch I don’t know, I’m not watching! What?
@hurricanehorton I’ve actually just bought her one.
@tiffanyjbudd One day we will!
@whiteroserachel It wouldn’t! That would be brilliant! Bring them! Applications open now.
Tonight's Only Connect features a family team, one of whom is pregnant with twins! Is that a team of five? #OnlyConnect BBC Two, 8pm.
@every1000days - and you've found a nice photo from my 2015 pregnancy in which I am almost entirely cuboid!
@moseleymojo Wow, she really does look like me! Hope it goes well, sounds like a great campaign.
@ArtySmokesPS @GrindFromBehind Actually I gave my chips to someone else 😎 But it was a fun night, Old School Vic, very enjoyable.
@Brays_Cottage @richardosman Or Rain Men, Marcus Berkmann’s book about cricket! But what’s the category? If we had that clue on OC, it would be something quite specific like “Dustin Hoffman films” and then unlucky if you say Iron Man...
@LeoBennetto @CJT3 @IceStella77 @MrsRelli No, I think with the Kinder Joy, the packaging is egg shaped but only half is edible and the toy is in the other half, so the *contents* are not an egg (or egg shaped) and you would struggle to eat the toy by mistake. I may be wrong, but I think so and that’s what I meant.
@patanna @Tommoriarty16 God forbid.
@CJT3 No! That’s not an egg!
@zippygwr Sorry!! They get very over subscribed.
@DanNethercott Yes, she is a retired anaesthetist.
@madpaduk @ccbaxter We did annual specials for Comic Relief/Sport Relief and Children In Need, but haven’t done those for a couple of years. Some great, well-known quizzes took part.
@SenseiChanning Magnificent.
@jeffkimberpoker @keiththecamel What a game
@philoundering Oh, I expect so.
@JeffBeckFan I mean, quite.
@cellini13 @RevStu Very interesting! And fair play if it was first, it does seem to be, but for my money the Ronnies’ one is much better done.
@ManjKalar My pleasure. It’s like PG Wodehouse, almost impossible not to enjoy.
@Mand_J_Hunt MIX THE TWO
@TheEponymousBob You'll need more than that. ;-)
@GeorgieADuncan *clinks rum glasses*
@FortescueIIIN Quick before it closes! https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@onezeroronny @artschoolwank Aw shucks.
@joecollettcramp We've all told ourselves that.
@jhferguson @OnlyConnectQuiz I hope she wasn't shocked by the explanation.
@Airmail70 I'm not sure, but congratulations and good luck!
@DrewMorley1 IT IS FOR KIDS. You should see the grown-up one.
@viewaskew3804 ...and what about weeing on an expensive bill from nPower? Does that work?
If you're watching Only Connect and you've never seen this sketch, you'll want to. And if you have, you'll want to. Pure comic genius:  https://t.co/JMulwvOuex
It’s a lovely Only Connect tonight, including a great self-deprecating joke from one of the captains and a nice chat about my mum. 8pm, BBC Two.
@cardiffbites @crwbanod Cheers!
@Tiggylicious Thank you! It’s actually from a year ago, that piece, but thanks for the reminder - I was glad to read it again myself. Such an important topic at this time of year. Best wishes.
@martinisnotaspy @OnlyConnectQuiz Thank you! Not exactly; I always know the gist. Sometimes they’re properly written. Often I know broadly what I’m going to say but let the wording come out however it does.
@KelseyAPye Thank you, happy birthday!
@willhowells @exitthelemming WHAT IS THAT?
@andyeva01005343 I’ve played one poker tournament so far this year. I need them to bring back the London EPT!
@milopuss Very good round suggestion.
@Katie_Jew ! That’s five card draw. But sure, I see where you’re coming from...
@hotchocxlate !! Tell him he shouldn’t be disappointed. The team found our connection *and another one*; he should take delight in their mental dexterity. That’s the essence of the show!
Oops! Too late. https://t.co/OEEmJEJ4jH
@c_jackson_500 @RufusHound @ArtworkKing Very gracious! Thank you! I’m watching the show now and I’m confident it’s absolutely fine. Our fault for not spotting it before.
@HombreVerde7 @nicktozer1667 @JohnDowell4 I look forward to meeting you........ https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@RufusHound @Dougie29391334 lol
@MarkFinnigan79 @RufusHound @ArtworkKing He WAS in a team! For a charity special! He is an absolutely brilliant quizzer.
@RufusHound @ArtworkKing Half the beauty of Only Connect is that it's not an exact science. In a later match I might not have given it. But sometimes I have to go with my gut (and sometimes it takes some debate) and in this case I felt these new players had triumphed in the spirit of the game.
@RufusHound @ArtworkKing Italians worked for *three* (Caesar, Garibaldi, Margarita). +96 worked beautifully for the two; "volume up to 99" is debatable but in both cases not giving would've penalised their great brains for spotting something neat, niche and clever that we hadn't spotted. In a first heat!
@HombreVerde7 @nicktozer1667 @JohnDowell4 They would never be given it after 1 clue if it wasn't the answer we had. It's about connections. You can't make those with one.
@RufusHound Hurrah! That's very nice xxx
@SamStev46866209 Enjoy the show!
@beckyk25 @BBCTwo @OnlyConnectQuiz Don’t worry Becky, I don’t think that’s a real person! I don’t really understand about bots but definitely not worth engaging.
@SamStev46866209 Ah. You didn’t watch the programme then! But have another look at the question.
@VikramMookerjee @HombreVerde7 No, it isn’t like that. I think perhaps you misunderstand the nature of the show. They aren’t yes/no questions.
@SarahLouisaColl It’ll get harder... this is round one...
@Sandrine27Hk @BBCTwo @OnlyConnectQuiz But they aren’t wrong, you’re looking at it wrong. Only Connect questions aren’t like Mastermind questions. If they find a good enough connection, it can be right whether or not it’s the one we thought of.
@FNSinger No there have been a few others actually. You don’t remember the Cosmopolitans a couple of series ago, for example?
@EmmaKennedy THAT’S NOT THE ANSWER
@AdrianBavister I would never do such a thing. Let em drink.
@chrisoakley @OnlyConnectQuiz No. Many people have secretly hoped for a hole in a condom.
@HombreVerde7 You’ll have to remind me the question/answer..
@GeorgeOnToast @OnlyConnectQuiz It hasn’t happened yet. You imagined it.
@DavidAdamson2 Your gratitude is noted.
@AnverAnderson Rightly so!
@GeoffSlaughter @OnlyConnectQuiz ерунда
@nickmorrott @OnlyConnectQuiz Beyond my control!
What do contestants on Mastermind have in common with spectators at the US Masters? If you don't know, find out on Only Connect, tonight at 8pm on BBC Two. And if you *do* know, I'll see you next series! https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@beckyk25 @OnlyConnectQuiz Oh blimey! Thanks for the reminder...
@brianpskillings Oh dear, did you have tickets? I'm so sorry! *Completely* beyond anyone's control, luckily the sun is shining in London, I really hope you have a good day and I believe they will be in touch with the new date - make sure you get tickets that guarantee entry!
@jamesianosborne They will be; they haven't been on the radio yet.
@PMorlim Well, in a way, if there's a logistical problem it is only logical to postpone...
Meanwhile, free tickets for my live chat with the excellent UNA STUBBS, on a vaguely car-related theme (London, evening of 3rd December) are available here: https://t.co/INjAtaHHAL
Anyone who was coming to the recording I'm doing at lunchtime today, unfortunately that is POSTPONED for logistical reasons; sorry sorry and if you have tickets, someone from the BBC will be in touch about changing them!
@Sandrine27Hk @Charity_Case_ @BBCTwo @OnlyConnectQuiz Ok. But some teams use up the full time available for every question, others get them in a quarter of the time. How do you suggest filling the gaps? We tried getting the Spice Girls in, but it put us over budget.
@jakedownsmusic What’s going on with my arm in that picture?! It’s like a grotesque Halloween toy. I hope it won’t be an intrinsic part of your costume.
@RobbieRinder What a lovely thing you wrote! Thank you very much xxxxx
For the last recording of Women Talking About Cars (Radio Four), I'm excited to announce I will be meeting the legendary UNA STUBBS! 7.15pm on Monday 3rd December, in London - free tickets available here: https://t.co/INjAtaHHAL  (Note, these tickets tend to go quickly)
@TheGroundHoper @OnlyConnectQuiz @sianglloyd That's great! I love it! UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GONE PUBLIC!
@THEbitchiestgay I love an echidna
@THEbitchiestgay Does that mean I have to be some sort of horse?
@mh2eets @OnlyConnectQuiz If only there was a teleprompter...
@BarkerBridgeTD @HoustonMargaret But it would be unlikely for there to be two such clear options on a question. Are you sure the sequence wasn't going backwards?
@HoustonMargaret I don't remember it but if it WAS tinker, tailor, soldier then yes absolutely "sailor" would be an acceptable answer.
@Nigella_Lawson @Jemima_Khan What do you think poker was invented for?
@John1Houghton It was twenty years ago. I certainly wasn’t any kind of celebrity, even if I am now, which I’m not. I was a kid. I went to the football a lot then. I think you’re reading it a bit harshly.
@MartinJhowell Thank you, that's very nice.
@squidgybo Please tell your wife that's no bar to coming on the show! We've had many brilliant visually impaired quizzers, so if she's any good, remember Braille Walls R Us.....
@Garaoke1971 Ooh sparkly
@felicefan What? No!
@MrBeachHut Well that’s true, that is a plus.
@sweedie71 Thank you. That's very nice of you to say.
Scheduling is out of my control. I don't know exactly which introduction is coming up when, or I'd have asked them to cut it. It's not AWFUL but it's the wrong tone, it's a light joke and it feels disrespectful. Even if nobody else minds, I don't like it and I'm sorry.
I've just watched the start of the show. Hmm. When we recorded that introduction, I assumed it would be broadcast in August which is when the series usually starts! It feels absolutely wrong in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday, especially this year. I'm really sorry.
Whoa, only three weeks in and nearly forgot! Only Connect starts in five minutes on BBC Two, and then I think the extended #HIGNFY is later this evening on BBC One.
@EdMcB1973 @tracey_crouch @gondorffhenry There were two, https://t.co/PbppWYDgVu and then  https://t.co/Z6HY3zz3ve
@ozzyc8osboy @Mac_TheMouth It wouldn't.
@qikipedia I found a small metal plaque in mine, engraved: “Ahead lies disappointment and failure”. What do you think it signifies?
@YeduhinMeheddin @floozette @LewesBonfire Is that true? If so, excellent. I think the Pyromaniacs are also on Only Connect on Monday! I was always confused by the name, though. Somebody told me it was a joke about pies, but then why not the Pieromaniacs?
@kbear58 @JaneyGodley @RobbieRinder @BBCOne @OFalafel I just read out the suggestion, but I enjoyed it very much!
@BeyondSimian @AdrianDurham_ @HIGNFY_official I think  1) if you sent actual spam to a vegan or Muslim that would be disgusting 2) "freedom of action" is very different from freedom of speech and I'm not an anarchist 3) using that joke to discuss the ethics of posting ACTUAL spam is magnificently Monty Python. Happy weekend.
@fionaunwin You’re in Moulton? Seriously? I’ve been to lovely Moulton many times. Small world.
@fionaunwin That's very nice of you, thank you!
@NCFC_Paul I never bet on facts, but I think it *might* be a town.
@johnbond75babe Because there's no autocue to read. I'm just talking.
@DiscoDanB Don't let that get in the way. I'll give you your freedom.
@killerbee2605 @JaneyGodley @RobbieRinder @BBCOne And mine. That's why they're on and off so much.
@NCFC_Paul But Ely is a city, isn't it? And Wisbech isn't a city?
@BeyondSimian @HIGNFY_official Well, okay, but that was a pun on spam, not *actual* spam....
@flawleafclover @RealDMitchell I'm certainly pleased about it.
@RobbieRinder IT'S FIXABLE
@steveg01 Oh Dave Gorman's fantastic, have a lovely evening.
@TrumpGlasgow @pokeymon5 @gentlemanjack72 @JaneyGodley @RobbieRinder @BBCOne I expect so. I'm already baffled.
@JaneyGodley @RobbieRinder @BBCOne I can hardly wait...................x
I'm hosting Have I Got News For You tonight; on Ian's team is the hilarious @JaneyGodley and with Paul is the fabulous @RobbieRinder - that's at 9pm on @BBCOne.
@valentinelow Yum yum
@tinytiptoes NOTHING SCARES ME
@BowiePablo Probably, nothing will change. But I’m absolutely certain that it’s more likely to change because of Tracy Crouch’s resignation then if she stayed and fiddled about with the small print.
@Stapes @catehall Excellent, thank you xx
@catehall @Stapes (I mean, or I will, but I’m incredibly shortsighted and invariably drunk, so it may be more effective the other way round).
@catehall @Stapes This is all very beautifully expressed. Why don’t we know each other? If we’re ever in the same room, I hope you’ll come and say hello.
@BerrillNorman @tracey_crouch Good luck, I wish you success with the next adventure.
This is a wonderful thing to see, whatever you think (or don’t) about gambling and FOBTs. It’s a person, a Member of Parliament, acting entirely on principle and not at all on self-interest. She did it quickly, decisively and without looking back. Very well done. https://t.co/arsNlylYKp
@tracey_crouch Well done, that was a really brave and difficult thing to do. It will mean an awful lot to people.
@EssaysConcern @BBCNewsnight @gilescoren Thank you, that's really good and decent of you to offer them. I can see you didn't mean it.
@RebeccaOkeeffe5 Oh yes, whenever David has a cold. He hates it but I insist.
@wil_macaulay @georgiaEtennant I genuinely don't even know what's offended you about it. Happy Halloween, anyway.
@BethWasOnly Oh, always. And in my handbag: phone and keys.
@sallycochrane BUT OF COURSE. I am an excellent craftsperson.
@AdrianMole22 Well, that's not very different from delirium really.
@eridukid Ah, that reminds me of my dating days.
@EssaysConcern @BBCNewsnight @gilescoren What a horrible thing to say. My father was very proud of both of us.
@CJT3 thank you.
NURSE DELIRIUM WILL SEE YOU NOW. https://t.co/OBygdKP2rp
@tackgrant @benmrowe STOP THESE CODES. No doubt it relates to the film in some way. I'M NOT LISTENING.
@stephbreakfast This is an absolutely brilliant episode of Have I Got News For You. I know I’m watching late. You’re just being hilarious. Just brilliant.
@LessGrumpy @OnlyConnectQuiz FIND ME A BANK THAT'S OPEN
@andybsei @OnlyConnectQuiz GOOD EVENING   https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@elladickson @OnlyConnectQuiz Oh please. I can barely remember my own phone number.
@nickovdw I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.  https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@benmrowe I mean, you know, OR PART 1. None of them.
@Joanne48063505 @SDHappened Thanks for being a lovely audience!
@cc71 Hmmm. It's nice but the problem is, why THAT sequence? Why not 11 / 27 / 311, if you see what I mean? We'd be jumping too many numbers. Do you agree @quizquizquiz? Meh, if I'd just had a large meal I might give it to you. But I think I shouldn't.
@onezeroronny @RiggerTheGeek Hahaha I'd have been delighted to arm-wrestle you for it.
As if things weren’t spooky enough this week, Only Connect is on tonight - 8pm on BBC2! Let’s just say it’s a very *leonine* episode...
@JamieRichmond16 Yes, that’s excellent.
@keirshiels *shiver*. Have a lovely night. (Perhaps singing “schadenfreude evening” to the tune of that song from South Pacific).
@SusanDianeGill ...between which there is also little difference...
@kjcmcd Surely both? What kind of parent ARE you?
@margotuden That’s fine, but you still have to notice when it’s happening!
Do the clocks go back tonight? This isn’t talked about enough. It’s an oddly furtive thing. How many arrangements do you think go wrong in Britain on that Sunday every year? I say 78%.
@notCursedE @BBCTwo *tips hat gratefully*
@joecollettcramp @BBCTwo It’s a strong candidate for the renaming the actual show.
@RogerBoon1960 That is a very nice piece, I was very touched.
@aswinsek They never used to be, that’s for certain.
@brucegaryevans @guybranum But I saw you.
@ThatCarterBlunt @FieldPat @Rylan That was a very great achievement. It very nearly justifies the assumption.
@Atrss Next week!
@Kitty_B_Good Ah, you might not have GOT the answer, but you did KNOW the answer...
@guybranum I’m sure you will. I’m always hanging about.
@mrskelloggs @OnlyConnectQuiz I don’t remember the question but I’d be surprised.... @QuizQuizQuiz ?
@AlexJCall Of course not!
@richardahunt @FloellaBenjamin Yes. The answer to that is the whole theme of the programme, really.
@Horseshoe0 @BBCRadio4 It wouldn't work.
@Crosso88 Here!  https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@JudgeRoySnyder @niggi Aw, you're too kind
@smithp573 I have not.
@thegaryshow A magnificent image.
@GladKent They look like an excellent purchase. Happy stomping.
@liziaqua88 @FloellaBenjamin The series starts in a few weeks, it broadcasts very nicely in the run up to Christmas.
@herstrangefate @audible_com I'm not sure; @garethmammal may know about this... There are CDs of series 1 as well, but not series 2?
@MattLoxham @sjohndavey @janetrohear We spent the first night of our honeymoon in Preston. Had I known it was such a quizzers' nest, it would have been *even sexier*.
@opento @MattLoxham No, Matt's right, after one clue there is ALWAYS an alternative sequence. Nobody could devise a sequence that's unique after one clue! I'd usually only give points for an alternative if it worked for all three clues - though I have sometimes done it on two in exceptional cases.
@ReynoldsMD @VDavey3 @maidment_jeremy @TaraWardBooks @OnlyConnectQuiz ...such are my social skills.
@opento Oh I see. Very nice lateral thinking - but if you came in after just one clue I couldn’t give it. After one clue, there are always alternative sequences!
@JoRoseSings @morleyalice GOOD CATEGORIES
@lambingtales @OnlyConnectQuiz I'm afraid our question setters aren't allowed anywhere near sheep. Not again.
@double_canister @FloellaBenjamin It's insane isn't it! Nearly 70 years old, looking literally half that.
Thanks to everyone in our live audience tonight; the series will start going out on @BBCRadio4 in a few weeks' time.
Here I am with Sarah Hadland, welcoming our guest for the first recording of Women Talking About Cars series 3: the incredible @FloellaBenjamin. What an honour to meet that great lady, who seems to sparkle with joy and magic. https://t.co/PX5R9QOpI3
@rowec1 No, no, I'll get to it ...
@jordandias Look! You already can! https://t.co/Hk6nT6HH9k
@tommykl96 @stanleywanguk @LifeofBrian92 What an excellent line up.
@htccarrr They basically ARE emojis...
@LydiaMizon I'd forgotten that we did once have a team called the pyromaniacs... but I might have known.
@opento You'll have to remind me what the question was, I'm afraid I didn't watch..
Like smallpox, it was bound to come back eventually: Only Connect returns to our screens, tonight at 8pm on BBC Two.
@McLeanAmy I hope you enjoy it!
@Raoul74 I’m delighted he thinks there’s nobody in the world who simply hasn’t heard of the show! I don’t think he means his remarks to be a compliment, but he makes us sound like the Super Bowl.
@Alphagoat007 I found it a big struggle myself. As an example of love, they’re just inspiring. It’s so great he’s written this.
Just watched the first episode of There She Goes by Shaun Pye. I’ve been friends with Shaun for 25 years, he’s done so many brilliant things but this is a different level. It’s funny and true and devastating and an incredible achievement.  https://t.co/jevp3BIH0s
@joseppi97 Please... too easy, we did that as a sequence question *in pictures*
@triplesilk @RealDMitchell You need to mix it up a little...
@jealnicola LANGUAGE
@jealnicola I mean seriously. What a special edition. Robert Crampton could take our mother.
@jealnicola @TimesMagazine @Sathnam is taking @caitlinmoran's mother on holiday?
@SenseiChanning @MattStoutPoker Never come across that. But on first glance I’d say it would surely be more fun with no qualifier and a declare. Otherwise how do you scoop? It’s a down side of Archie for me, but in this you couldn’t even make a wheel?
@Harriet_ms @exitthelemming That’s a very lovely tale.
@exitthelemming I don’t have much trouble teaching my daughter to question authority. How to get her to stop bloody questioning it...
@vonniha @Sassyb74 @rickedwards1 That’s kind! The very reason many people would vote against!
@VenerusLee It starts on Monday!
@JonnyGeller Now you tell me.
@Pmarber @phelpsiesarah  “To have peace, war is required”. Is that definitely the case?
@winklepin @Bobby_Seagull Sorry to hear that. But we had to return eventually.
@richardosman Well....
@richardosman They were always a lay to go, weren’t they? Sigh.
@DammitTracy It’s series 3!! https://t.co/bbnlafeY4k
@VanessaHeron @DigiVictorian @MimiMatthewsEsq This is the kind of thing that, if @qikipedia don’t tell me about it, I never know. Pull your fingers out, elves.
@janinegibson @LissaKEvans @frankcottrell_b @cazroz Sorry... for a moment I thought that said “Scrabble drama”.
@misterjaydee @qikipedia Gosh that QI seems so long ago, never mind the poker game.
@FrankieNeary I enjoyed that.
@qikipedia Aaarrggghhh!
@davemarcus2018 Either way it’s a great weekend.
@Gillian_Emm Everyone’s a critic.
@DavidartyL I talk of little else.
@charitablemark @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo No, we will be! Mondays at 8 or 8.30, I think they haven’t swapped the order back
@GhostWifeDenton Nobody hates hares.
@penguinland8 No thank you, I'm not hungry.
@Marchad1 Did it suggest you switch her off and on again?
@Unnamedinsider I love everybody in that story.
@Mycatlola Hahahahaha
@ThatCarterBlunt I must seem obsessed.
Why would predictive text turn "hares" into "hated" ? That preference reveals everything that is currently wrong with the world.
@FrizFrizzle The main problem is, I rarely get a question right even when watching an episode I already attended.
@Kitty_B_Good @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo That's a shame. You seem like someone I'd like to have met.
@nsbarstow I think about six months. But it will seem longer.
@DVDSmith @4randomwords I'm not sure of the answer to this - Mike might - if not, @OnlyConnectQuiz could be your people...
@ShazzBakes No space here to explain all the complexities of that exchange, and I think comments on a comedy show shouldn't need explanatory notes. But I'm not a mainstream person; I'm the host of a strange cultish quiz that's on BBC Two by mistake. Trust me, I always mean 8 things at once.
@ShazzBakes @lydiaenigma @NeilImperator @WingsScotland You're moving the goalposts! I meant you misremember the wording of the exchange, and I think you may have misjudged the tone. But JR-M aside, generally it's dark waters to say that other people's attractions are "weird". Why shouldn't they be? People are weird. God bless that!
@Fradvatar No no! It's only about the abusive ones. I don't reply to many of those anyway (inexplicably, I don't actually GET many of those, + I only see about half the tweets I get) but it was explained to me last night that the combination of abuse + 20 followers is a bot 80% of the time.
@houseminion @Good_omens179 @daraobriain @Kathbum @Baddiel @seannwalsh ! You wouldn't be ignored because of that! But someone who sent random abuse, that seemed designed to get a reaction, THEY might be ignored because of that! It's not the numbers, it's the combination of numbers and strangely twisted messages.....
@ArabianShark @daraobriain @Kathbum @Baddiel @seannwalsh Yes. Good. I'm getting a whiteboard and pens.
@Andyh1302 @daraobriain @Kathbum @Baddiel @seannwalsh Ah but the equation has to include tweets that are like sharp sticks prodded at people with lots of followers. I mean, I've only just learned this and I doubt it's a 100% failsafe analysis programme, but it broadly works.
@Baddiel @daraobriain @Kathbum @seannwalsh Well you might have known, if you'd just looked at my numbers a bit more closely before throwing your accusations around.
@ShazzBakes @NeilImperator @WingsScotland @Jacob_Rees_Mogg I think you may be misremembering the encounter.
@daraobriain @Kathbum @Baddiel @seannwalsh ...and as a result will broadly avoid replying to people with those sorts of numbers, for the fun of knowing the silence must be frustrating.
@daraobriain @Kathbum @Baddiel @seannwalsh Hey Dara. Someone explained to me last night: if you look at that person's numbers (450 tweets, 40 followers) - they're likely a "bot" (a human one) trying to annoy people with lots of followers, get responses, boost their own numbers and monetise later. I enjoyed hearing that!
@AdrianGibb2 Look at that little ticket to the past! A nice start to a London Thursday. Thank you very much for sending.
@Arm_of_Scrounge I am a fan. I met him doing a Great British Bake Off for Sport Relief, I thought he was lovely.
@webbiewanderers Of course!!!! I don’t mean anything like that at all. Just that my memory of this joyous image is a little altered.
@keiththecamel Welcome.
I can’t be the only person who’s looking back on this in a different light. https://t.co/8iRPBwiqYj
@McLeanAmy Lovely! Perhaps you’ll join in on the night and we’ll get to say hello.
@Mgwjambo No I think that’s right. But these days you never know until it’s actually on and you hear yourself talking.
@RebeccaOkeeffe5 Oh lord. I’d better watch it and find out what I said.
@AdrianGibb2 Oh thank you! I loved making that programme. Absolutely please do send the images, if that's allowed.
@freetrog77 @sanditoksvig You're very kind!
@Shaunicus13 aw shucks
@GarryVaux @FloellaBenjamin I'm very excited about it! I'm a huge admirer of Lady Benjamin, there are so many things to talk to her about. I think we're going to have a really warm, fun evening. Free tickets available here: https://t.co/lHj0GjS8Ac
@PensionsSimon I’m actually being quite rubbish in a poker game.
@angelotdr @sanditoksvig https://t.co/KzlWhHDeE4
@4randomwords OMG I *love* the thought of being someone’s boss. Get me! Sell sell sell! Coffee please Miss Phipps!
@blue_windmill Ah that's good, thank you, very helpful!
@Rusalka343 @IanTyrrell69 I agree, but that's because we're dealing with an unprecedented amount of sugar added to everything. I'm happy for my daughter to have all the same rubbish I did as a child, but when I was a child there wasn't so much sugar in.. you know.. in All Bran and orange juice and BREAD!
@blue_windmill That one's confusing because it gives the sugar content including the milk... it says 7.3g compared to Weetabix 1.7g! But presumably 5 or 6g of that is the milk and Weetabix don't include the milk on theirs? #confusing
@fimunn Who wouldn’t?
@brogansden Well I’m not a dietician .. but I would say that breakfast sounds pretty sugary too! Less of a big deal if you’re a grown up though, I mean, we’re ruined already.
@StephenKightley Yes, it’s a about a quarter shorter
@HollysmumT21 @Danford2013 @groomo My engagement ring is actually made from that.
@RimothyTadford @sainsburys That sounds good, thank you
@oldohu Well sure, it’s full of sugar!
@florilegia That’s one of the weirdest facts I’ve heard in a long time.
@IanTyrrell69 Oh there’s no problem with Weetabix, it tastes nice and is low sugar and gets eaten happily. Just would be nice to have a few options!
@theznayt Thank you...
@Bumble_London They play off a grown up fear that stuff without salt or sugar “doesn’t taste of anything”, when of course that isn’t true for little ones at all. It’s cruel, it exploits the most well-meaning intentions.
@alicemeallan Amazing isn’t it, shredded wheat (difficult for very small ones to eat) is so much better than most “special baby cereals for 6 month olds” !
@jamesvogl It has about half the sugar of Frosties. But nearly the same as Coco Pops.
@suzyrobSoprano Coconut Nectar is actually my stripper name.
@isoshepherd !!! Very good point.
@SeanPeppercorn But that isn’t true. Cornflakes are delicious with half that sugar.
@keiththecamel I know I am.
@Mattjohnsons I mean quite. Not since Disney did that surprising deal to put Dumbo on heroin.
It just doesn’t make sense that you can have weetabix and ready brek with almost no sugar and then special toddler cereal - for much more delicate little palates, needing far less sensation - which is massively sweeter! And then SELL it like a health product! Grrr.
Why would you make this cereal, especially for children, clearly marketed as healthy, and then include nearly twice as much sugar as you’d find in a bowl of cornflakes? Three times as much as Weetabix? Ok it’s not “refined” sugar. But I still feel tricked. https://t.co/4ihRovwTUS
@lizamconway Oh I see. Well I’m afraid I’m not an expert - we’ll discuss electric cars if a guest has ever had one - but it does seem like they’re the future......
@SeaFriend Very much so.
@lizamconway No, it’s not really about cars in that way. The episodes are separated by guest.
@SeaFriend Too late for this series! But you could audition again for the next one!
@shardadean Oh shame (about being away, not the excellent result of the purchase!). We will definitely record a couple more this year, watch this space.
@NaomiLWood I don't know how to do that, but if you click on the link in the earlier tweet then it tells you how and it's free.
@NaomiLWood @bbcshowstours Come to one of the shows! You're just the kind of audience member we like to hear from!
We're going to make a new series of 'Women Talking About Cars' for Radio 4! These recordings are always very good fun. Tickets for the first two (October 22nd and 29th in London) are available here: https://t.co/lHj0GjS8Ac @bbcshowstours
@Lettybird !!!!! https://t.co/4AVlWTatN8
@KevinConnelly8 High praise indeed.
@Bobby_Seagull Thank you! Hope you've enjoyed being in my slot. Please do not quote out of context.
Still no Only Connect for two more weeks! But if you're yearning to hear my anxious croak on a Monday night, I'll be on next week's QI at 10pm. And the ghastlier quiz hops back into place on October 22nd. I think. https://t.co/iuBXfgvQH7
@thegaryshow l_foulkes I think it starts in about three weeks!
@LouiseB555 @sagedonkey The amount I eat, I need a lot of kitchens.
@CJABradbury Good luck! Have a great evening
He was so brilliant, fearless and funny on stage. And these were days when the club promoter told me: “One night when I arrived, the queue went so far down the block I assumed it was a bomb scare”.
@Saund65 Thanks, I think I’ve updated it but I’m kind of a techno moron
I saw @PatricKielty perform at the Empire in Belfast when we were both basically children. It was only just after the ceasefire but he was doing jokes about the Troubles before that anyway. It seems like a hundred years ago but - from that thread - suddenly very close as well.
I’ve felt pretty bamboozled by politics myself for the past couple of years, but this 20-part thread by @PatricKielty is brilliantly written and very illuminating. https://t.co/RLUKTNR4EI
He was so brilliant, fearless and funny on stage. And these were days when the club promoter told me: “One night when I arrived, the queue went so far down the block I assumed it was a bomb scare”.
@AdamEngberg @thewhippetbeans Well perhaps it was.
I would very much like to see that play. https://t.co/j7R0YlqlOe
@TessabellePixie My 3 year old does not do that...
@EstherStanhope1 @SimmonsLLP That’s nice! Thank you, I thought it was a lovely evening.
@the_one_Mick_P @FraserNelson You’re very kind! Not in a million years.
@underseamonkey @runitup247 Sadly, I expect so.
@andrewhunterm @JohnLittledyke @JamesHarkin @OnlyConnectQuiz I *think* it will be on during the week between Christmas and New Year. With scheduling, you never quite know til the fat lady sings - and I haven’t sung, so it might change, but that is their current plan.
@andyhen @MightyBij I think it starts in mid October
Very much enjoyed The Bodyguard last night. https://t.co/gFSoMN2SRc
@HelenLloyd28 Oh that’s nice! I hope the beer takes the edge off.
@onslaughtstreak No bluffing
@helcatwill @_seashelleyes_ @mpaulawebb That’s a nice thing to read. I like it when people come round again. It’s a bit ‘Our Friends In The North’, makes everything feel sort of cyclical and safe. Like it hasn’t been such a journey after all.
@victoria_frith I like the sound of you enormously.
@dollyalderton @exitthelemming @mariellaf1 It’s great isn’t it? A perfect column. FWIW I married my absolute soulmate, which could never have happened if I’d panic-settled at some ludicrously young age like 37.
@scleary4 @ScurrilousMay @padraigpoker @SenseiChanning @duvalljeff Very glad to hear it! I will, I will.
@JDBakewell I know I know! Very late this year. It starts October 22nd. Lovely to see you too xx
@JenniferTilly @joebeevers @melissalvla @ScurrilousMay @padraigpoker @SenseiChanning @duvalljeff They give me mixed feelings! I feel about a hundred years old.
@joebeevers @melissalvla @ScurrilousMay @padraigpoker @SenseiChanning @duvalljeff https://t.co/7caa5QnhsM
@joebeevers @melissalvla @ScurrilousMay @padraigpoker @SenseiChanning @duvalljeff https://t.co/kPiMzH3yTr
@SenseiChanning @kpnuts134 @duvalljeff @ScurrilousMay @padraigpoker And yet.... I’m STILL nostalgic. Ridiculous.
@johnpayne92 I’m trying to work out how much I’d pay to hear that conversation. It’s not an insignificant sum.
@johnpayne92 That’s my kind of holiday.
@MarkTommostuff @Kristbjorg_Una @BBCTwo @OnlyConnectQuiz My lord. It would be CARNAGE.
@Kristbjorg_Una @BBCTwo @OnlyConnectQuiz It’s all recorded and on ice! Current plan is late October, but we’ll know more nearer the time.
@sammyflyinghigh Well played!
@Babygoestooblog Well, each hieroglyph denotes a particular question. They aren’t related to the image, but they are pre-assigned. Getting the teams to choose their own questions (blind) ensures it’s a random draw.
@they0rkiebarkid @8Outof10Cats @jimmycarr @kevinbridges86 @gillinghamjoe @amateuradam @susie_dent @RachelRileyRR @Channel4 I hope chocolate. I’m a romantic.
@DocCrom @LydiaMizon Ah yes.. in the later stages I sometimes give a departing team one of their actual “intro cards” - but Lydia you were never on a departing team! You got the trophy instead! (No disrespect Rob.. there wasn’t much in it..)
@Bobby_Seagull @glorafin @BBCTwo No, it’s the other way round! The BBC wanted a shorter series so we changed the structure! Perhaps we’re better suited to the cold blast of November, though.
@alfiemoore @z0e_davies @SarahMillican75 My broad world view is that if everyone always tried to do the kind thing, we’d be basically fine. So if you think what you’re doing (eg walking behind in the dark, or anything else) might frighten or spook someone, of course the kind thing is to not do it.
@deYook Then you’re unlucky we never got to Skype. Check your DMs! xx
@deYook https://t.co/pSSaLuGj5Y
@wh1974 @missa_clegg I think it’s October. I don’t know why!
@bs7909 Those words may come back to haunt you.
@dulcieSTBAM Oh that’s nice to hear! Happy holidays.
@nigewelly @GylesB1 Not to know? Who said that? I’d be interested to know where that came from!
@bs7909 I can’t do anything electrical. I literally once failed to wire a plug.
@BradAllenNFL @SimUKCricket @SenseiChanning I said that? 😎
@BradAllenNFL - and thank you.
@BradAllenNFL !! Unlucky.
@Barryarrows That’s very kind, but it wouldn’t be the same.
@andi1235 @jackwc @OnlyConnectQuiz It really brings out the visual sparkle of the show, I feel. When it comes to production values, our motto is very much that of Cubby Broccoli: put the money on the screen.
@jackandice Can’t believe I forgot!
@TOMMEAD1987 @IAmTheMusicCat ALL OUR TEAMS ARE BRILLIANT
@tycoeden @MAMAPUFF @MagsTheObscure @LYNNMILDNER The media, for example.
@JonathanMarkUK Riding waves? Or horses? I’m guessing the latter! He was strangely good at that. If he was a keen surfer as well, we never heard about it... thank you for your nice message.
@CTWarriorMonkey You’d be surprised. People either give things away or they don’t, with sunglasses or without.
@sam1178 I won a trophy for best cake at the Clacton Festival 2009. One of my proudest moments.
@iamtbw Well it was, until... until...
@davidwetton Let’s be realistic, it’s too late to be a vet now.
@charlietabloid @LydiaMizon ... yet secretly, we treasure our weirdness, wrapping it round us like the medieval cloak we wear on weekends.
@MSpring149 No risk of that with my husband. He doesn’t have a car.
@the_real_gart @multikev You’ve got some beautiful irony going on in your tweet there, Gart.
@MaryJoanna Ooh, a riddle of quizzers, I like it. Course, it’s bound to be a collective noun for something else already. @QuizQuizQuiz?
@ahrweymouth @Penteana I’m a big fan of Gyles Brandreth! Very clever and interesting fellow.
@jamesrudge1982 No!
@GylesB1 Hurrah! It starts in October. There’s a terrific all-female team I know you’ll love.. Great quizzing stars Emma Laslett and Gail Trimble return for a special... as well as exciting new players and plenty of brilliant men, of course. It’s a vintage year.
@osymandus It’s not my brother, it’s Gyles Brandreth!
@KrisBrown017 Well, congratulations!
@AlexWLeighton Give me a minute
@KrisBrown017 Unless Gyles Brandreth has a sister I don’t know about.
@KrisBrown017 What? It’s Gyles Brandreth! Not.. not..
Mind you, all this “Women can’t do X”, “Women don’t like Y”... always nonsense. I’ve heard it about comedy, about poker, about quizzing... sometimes I feel like Jack Lemmon in the last frame of Some Like It Hot.
Oh Gyles! You don’t watch Only Connect! I am HEARTBROKEN. If you did, you’d know it was riddled with brilliant women quizzers, *riddled*. https://t.co/WyUJJLJv6F
@LydiaMizon I gave them a quote. The gist was much as you’re saying: the year of the all-male UC final, our final was *predominantly* female, but nobody mentioned it. They tell the story they want to tell. Ironically, I don’t think that quote got used. 🙄
@barnyboatman @JohnnyDuthie Ooh, can I come?
@HedgeNewby I guess we all are.
@DC_tweetiepie I enjoyed that image tremendously.
@MylesWalsh10 It seriously could be that.
@toria970 That’s nice! I think! If not, I’m sorry...
@BethWasOnly I can imagine that very clearly.
@NicolaFry1980 The original sounds great.
@sarahcluscombe That’s lovely
@SargeCraig667 Oh no, there certainly wasn’t chocolate on the counter.
@SStokes81 Maybe you’ll dream about it tonight.
@FabienTempest ! I don’t think so.
@Tupperwarepanda It IS, isn’t it?
@neverbeenonTV I like the sound of your wife.
@waggers5 That’s nice to know, thank you.
@gamecounsel Well, technically I’d have to find needles and cotton, wouldn’t I?
@Philippa_Perry ... I am now doing that, by the way. Just muttering quietly...
@Philippa_Perry Do you know, when I wrote the second one (“It definitely isn’t about something else”), I nearly just wrote that as a message to you. But then I decided you might be asleep.
IT DEFINITELY ISN’T ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
Last night I dreamt about a footstool we had in the house when I was a child. It had a navy fabric top and you could lift the lid and it was full of needles and cotton. Haven’t thought of that thing in 20 years, but I woke up crying. I really miss that footstool. Is that unusual?
@juliangr1 Very sensible approach.
@MsAverage Late October, I think. I might have forgotten my own name by then.
@JohnnyDuthie I don’t really understand that, but if you’re ever doing a big live event in London please tell me! In, like, a text. Something old fashioned like that xx
@thomasbeckett @sallyjwatson Looks like the bathroom is coming along nicely.
@unpaidgenius Oh I never had any booze tolerance. If you mean *taste*... that bounced back pretty fast.
@richardosman @phddandy You have prize money?
@sparkysaintsean !!! Wow that is ... wrong.
@BrianMaudling Ah. I'm afraid I saw this too late to save you.
@AlexBoyt3 Good spot.
@chattychooks @susie_dent @RachelRileyRR They are both infinitely cleverer than I am.
@Kanixtant It is pretty difficult.
@Kodanshi @jimmycarr @Channel4 @TheSeanLock @kevinbridges86 @gillinghamjoe @amateuradam But how can you see it when I'm so small in the photo?
@clarebalding If I watch it go out, I'll have to drink a couple of margaritas first to make sure I don't annoy myself by seeing better words at home.
I'm on 8 Out Of 10 Cats tonight on Channel 4 at 9pm. Here I am nestling in a man's armpit. https://t.co/xObyirxE4d
@underseamonkey @runitup247 @J_Hartigan @Stapes I hope I won.
@BunkanMerguson Happy anniversary!
@greglestrudels Yup, back later in the year.
@kkcomms @CointreauUK Thank you!
@KarenBorder @JDBakewell Define "helpful".
@Ped143 I'm uninsurable.
@Auntie_CarolG @squelchuk It is basically a health food.
@kkcomms @CointreauUK Oh that's very kind, thank you for the offer, but I'm happy to buy my own! As I discovered when I first started going on dates, free booze is a dangerous game.
@MrBrackstone Nice hands!
@JDBakewell Well of course.
@jondrytay Ohhh if only Stubbing a fag out in the yolk of a fried egg. #classy
@KatyGulliver Well we have those things. We’re not savages.
@jezzeralexander I am not. I have a lot of conditions, but that’s not one of them.
Shhh now I can’t talk any more we’re having some soup  Gin soup   No that was a joke it’s normal soup  With drinks
@PameDixon Oh! Really? Hello! Congratulations on your excellent offering# No, offspring
@Philippa_Perry When you do it at home you can add SO MUCH SALT
@max_silver I screwed up sorctacylsrylyb. Totally didn’t realise Barcelona was doable. Now it isn’t of course. Next year! I think my next spin is Vic in November. It’s pitiful. Come there and let’s plan a trip further afield WITH CHILDREN  let’s do it there are two few casino crèches
@David_Hicks It involves margaritas
@oldnicodemus IF ONLY THERE WERE SHOPS
@jondrytay Thank you xxx
@jondrytay No no there’s no need to make a big you know thank you xxxxxx just quietly but what do you mean, a margarita kit, that’s all I need
@Dickie_B Cointreau IS triple sec
@g1lennon RIGHTLY
@David_Hicks O I’ve got tomorrow all figured out don’t you worry about that
@squelchuk YES A plastic bag of limes  He is a genius
@max_silver It’s an excellent present
@max_silver Hello! How are you! You don’t understand, I’m quite drunk FULL OF AFFECTION AND NOSTALGIA. We never play poker any more! We must do that more!
@timthegambler SO I CAN HAVE TWO AT ONCE
For my birthday my husband bought me a cocktail shaker, two glasses, a bottle of Cointreau and a bottle of tequila. This is a f***ing disaster. I’ll never be sober again.
@DalyHugh Sshhhhhhh
@jonathancoe Do you know, I always thought there was nothing to astrology, but now I see that the stars align for me, Christian Slater *and* g-dragon....
@carolinel0uise @FOElliotM Happy birthday! Mine was yesterday.
@RevArun Thank you very much!
@warly1 @RealDMitchell Let's just say one of us does.
@hassledme I can’t in all honesty remember if there IS one about rhinos, but what better thing to study?
@DJNipsyIOW That would be a lovely fit! We could be the cheese and pineapple hedgehog in the middle of your birthday buffet.
@BeccaIndigo It’s only a matter of time, surely.
@natashadaniels @OnlyConnectQuiz Yes yes it’s only the paperback version of the book! There’s only one book!
@Seckabat @seanokeating Well that’s your prerogative, but it’s coming from you not them! The singing’s not a joke to me. I think it’s joyful. It’s not taking the piss; it’s silly but it’s full of love and humanity and glee.
Many people expressing sorrow that the broadcast of the new Only Connect series is so delayed. But remember, you can still cast a pall over your otherwise jolly summer with THIS:  https://t.co/S59p6Dfyxd
@seanokeating You won't be disappointed.
@deffo55 My foul language.
@hassledme I think there might be one about rhinos. See how much you can find out about them before October.
@G8YPE_Chris We did make some specials! I thought they might crop up every so often in advance of the series, but they haven't yet. Current plan is apparently to put them on in the middle of the series ahem.
@CP_diff @mattygroves I think there was once a day, about eight series ago, when they wanted to choose what I wear. That conversation didn’t happen twice 😵
@scottvivian No! It usually starts in August. But those decisions are out of our hands.
@odoherty1991 I know!!
The new Only Connect series is recorded, just not broadcast yet! We’ve been told it might start October 22nd or 29th. I’m hoping it goes on before too many of the facts change 😎 https://t.co/qGBbF50hHJ
@PeriwinkleCott1 It’s not soon! I don’t know exactly but I think it’s another couple of months!
@rockintheburbs I can’t think of better circumstances for it.
@stansturg Haha I don’t know. But good luck turning those pecan pies sour with frustration and defeat!
@GadgetGav @alexjhuang In poker, you don’t play against the house.
@sapphonica @PaulRobertsNHS It is Welsh.
@adhawkinsgh I expect so. Everything seems to be... I haven’t got one.
@Temolee Safe travels!
@killer_cob Later in the autumn. You’ll notice everything feels suddenly dark and cold.
@joshspero @jburnmurdoch @mkonnikova I certainly used to. It changed a bit because I was playing a lot with people who knew who I was, so they had different preconceptions, but not *massively* different. Certainly, exploiting others’ expectations is a useful part of the game.
@RachelVennard @JoanneVennard Good idea! There’s nothing to see there.
@djbloxham That’s what it says on my business card.
@muckyfellrunner Sadly not, but it will certainly help if you provide your own.
Ooh, look what’s come out in paperback just in time to ruin a family holiday!  https://t.co/MXLsKzw9Fd https://t.co/TFfHQlVL3G
@SenseiChanning @BullenRoss Hahahahaha
@simonkaston @onlyconnect Good.
We need to up our game @OnlyConnect https://t.co/l4i8GAApEW
@olparker1 @simonkaston Oh that’s nice! We saw it again last night. It’s properly brilliant. Obviously delightful, fun, moving, all that, but it’s also sort of *huge*. It says a lot about a lot. Very special film. I really love it. Well done everybody.
@paddyjim ALL our fans would prefer to watch Bob Mortimer fishing. As would I. We're only human.
@Doorstep_London @Ocado What a nice positive message xxx
@the0500 @darkmuse @Widnesiac @christt Also just to be clear, it wasn’t the charity’s funds, of course not! I wouldn’t go shopping with other people’s money!
@Doverliz @Ocado The reason was a power cut, I believe. These things happen. It would be good to have more back-up in case of problems, less pressure on driver numbers and for everyone in customer service to be as good as the best person.
@Brinderjit @qikipedia Hello! Nice to meet you too. Hope you didn’t get vertigo from the height of that hot air balloon 😎
@the0500 @darkmuse @Widnesiac @christt @Ocado I’ve used Ocado mainly because they do a one-hour delivery slot when others do 2 hours. That’s why it’s key to hit that window. It wasn’t about price because it was holiday treats for the children. It’s good to shop around of course. But when they turn up, Ocado are very good!
@keiththecamel @BSCREWDRIVER It’s awkward isn’t it? Obviously I wanted to let people know that it’s now fixed, and to say thank you. But at the same time, it’s been v upsetting and I think they might have only fixed it because of the fuss (I told them the purpose of the delivery this morning). So.. delicate.
Thanks Twitter for the back-up: @ocado has now made the delivery after all, and I spoke to a very nice woman in head office. I hope if anyone explained similar circumstances, they would do the same. Not a great day for them, but good trouble-shooting, thank you.
Very useful, noted. https://t.co/apbx4cwlK2
Good to know, thank you. https://t.co/DkiTaKy8Vv
@HughesyRhi @Ocado @AsdaServiceTeam That’s really good to know, thank you
They haven’t cancelled all their orders. They tell me the vans and drivers they use for rescheduling are all “busy”. I guess they just have a lot of customers that are more important than homeless children. Thanks @Ocado. Happy holidays.
So much for the power of Twitter! I tweeted @Ocado to say the order that’s “running late” is a delivery for a homeless families’ charity and could they please do their best to get there as soon as possible. They just replied to say they’ve cancelled it completely.
@Ocado Have done that. Please please please make sure the delivery gets there safely and not too late. This is the beginning of the school holidays, the families are excited have some treats coming, it would just be too awful if they didn’t arrive.
@Ocado This seems to be happening more and more, but I can never get through on the phone! I’m sure everyone affected is really frustrated but this is a particularly tricky case; I have no back-up. Can you give me a phone number of someone who will answer and can look it up?
@Ocado I booked a large delivery to go to a homeless families’ charity this morning. The website now says airily it will be several hours late. I’ve been ringing and ringing to tell someone this really matters and must get there before they close, but I can’t get through. Help?
@ChristoCAC Ooh.. I’ll have a look but that might be a bit beyond me.. if so, I’m sure it wouldn’t hurt to skip one!
@Neelima__ @sannewman I mean... it is a bit, isn’t it? More like it than most things are.
@BeingBoycie @RoddenTiree Do! It would cheer anyone up!  Mind you, I say that, I cried through most of it. You won’t have that risk with Jurassic World.
@SenseiChanning Ooh, I’d forgotten the MCC.
@mezosaurus @OnlyConnectQuiz How nice! Thank you!
@immy_wonderland I would have watched it again straight away, if it had been an earlier screening.
@matthewhwood Hahaha. It’s not that kind of prequel.
@PaddyWilliamson @taskmaster No dice! I never do signed photos, and if I did I wouldn’t charge. So you wouldn’t have ‘bought’ it. Why not get him an ink-and-stamp kit? Or a Mike Yarwood DVD? Two options for a workable joke there.
@MiltonGreen Lol. But I didn’t say I couldn’t recall a greater cinematic moment, I said I couldn’t immediately think of something I’d *liked more*. Very different!
@causon_heather Oh no. Even if you think, during the first 20 minutes, that you *might* be disappointed, stick with it. It’s really great.
@petergibbons481 Oh not just at the end. From about 15 minutes in, I think..
@MrsAMinett Yes exactly. Some people think if there’s colour and fun and laughter, it must be trivial. But not at all. Sometimes it’s the best way to say the biggest things.
@stevecastle Ok yes fine. That is the best film ever.
@GylesB1 A terrific film! But doesn’t touch it. DOESN’T TOUCH IT.
Mamma Mia 2 is genuinely one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen. In this moment, having just seen it, I can’t immediately think of anything I’ve liked more.
@SpaceyO2 I’m afraid not...
@teenyrainbow It’s actually got simpler! Thank the lord!
Lots of people asking where Only Connect is, now University Challenge is back on. The answer is: our series is a bit shorter this year and will start in the autumn! October I think.
@simonhall446 Yes, probably.
@gillez1 That’s a question for the BBC, not me! They must feel you can have too much of a good thing 😎
@garethtl @OnlyConnectQuiz No, there is more! But not til October.
@ColletteR ! Happy birthday. Nice is lovely.
@Philippa_Perry God help her if you don’t.
@TimDownie1 How many accents come into play during the sex scene? I think the perfect answer would be three, with the third one quite late on.
@Bobby_Seagull @FrankMPaul @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo Not til October, I think.
@andy_hennessy @UKChristmasTV They promised it will definitely be Mondays! But it's a shorter series than usual, so I think won't start till October.
@Si_Culley They’re really lovely! I mean, I only know them from the show but they were great.
@cbjames1214 I see you’ve remembered your password, Mum.
@JoeBazooooka No, it’s just the spellcheck thinking it’s being clever.
Dojovich and Nadal must be so tired, but they’re so good. Even now, if I stepped onto the court against either of them, I don’t think I could win more than a few points.
@Constituent_X That’s nice! Thank you! I think that show is good news in so many ways.
@PercyPants In the autumn!
Tonight on Channel 4 I'll be watching a man do football tricks and flirting with Big Narstie as usual. https://t.co/EjyRhmJvi9
@theAliceRoberts The level of sporting technicality in this conversation is already blowing my mind.
Ah well. Nice try.
@neveoliver Those don’t need to be two different things.
@Banjobetty3 A stronger tribute hath no man.
Come along then. How hard can it be?
@Helen_V100 I don’t think he has. I think divers rushing to help from all over the world, and the sacrifice of one of them, is a massive part of it. It’s the best of humanity.
Meanwhile the papers have all splashed on Brexit wrangling. LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY.
It’s weird the newspapers’ front pages today aren’t all about the Thai children’s rescue. I think they’ve taken our temperature wrong. The whole world was praying for that and a miracle came off. It’s just huge.
@AnnElizabeth4 I don’t have influence with my own three year old. Lovely to hear you liked the book though!
@_Tobeeornot_ Not at all! Have a lovely Sunday!
I find this extremely erotic. https://t.co/j9KMgkrS96
@_Tobeeornot_ I think you dreamt that one, but I’m delighted you did!
@JohnnyDuthie That’s definitely true. It’s incredibly well done.
@joebeevers @keiththecamel Ah, well now. I believe “bock”/“bok” is not in the official dictionary, it only has spoken usage among gamblers, so there is no “correct“. I choose to spell it like most of the words that rhyme with it (clock, knock etc). but a shortening of “springbok“ is just as likely!
@TheBigG77 Very good
I don’t want to see sobbing Swedes! Stop making it all sad!
Not to bock it, of course. This certainly may be England’s last game of the series.
I’m meant to be doing a TV show on Wednesday night! I feel a headache coming on. #professional
https://t.co/slIZcZKqTJ
@timbillington That’s why I mostly play Holdem. My tiny claws really struggle with 6 Card Omaha.
@Markgatiss Not one of the newspaper headlines. Not one.
@beanyuk @RyanRiess1 Many variants of poker don’t exist until we event them. Round here, there’s a new one every Tuesday.
@Adastra10 @kingtiatto Yes. That’s why he went out.
@RyanRiess1 Aw thanks Ryan! It was only my weekly home game. I lost a medium sized sum as usual, this week playing "Badugi-ha” - the pot split between the best Omaha hand (with flop) and the best Badugi. If there isn’t a WSOP tournament of it, I don’t know why not.
@GetItQuietly From the Sweep it still does
Ok, let’s play poker.
This is not enjoyable
Getting heated round my TV now. For a group of sedentary poker players, these boys are very quick to shout advice.
Was that chewing gum in Jamie Vardy’s mouth?! This is no time to be giving up smoking.
@SecretSam999 You’re very kind. They feel differently.
@kingtiatto My husband’s gone to one. I’m concerned for it.
I’m now worried about Britain’s pubs. Is there enough CO2 for extra time?
@Richshaugh It’s not that posh.
@GetItQuietly Ha! That’s very much the choice we’re facing.
@jonathansmout That’s bock, by the way. Nothing worse. I like a clean game.
@jonathansmout Tilbury dock
Of course the commentator said “This is a good result away from home” before the whistle blew, what an absolute Tilbury
One more shove and I won’t let them watch it.
I must say, these Colombian opponents are a very bad example to my poker players. Wouldn’t want this sort of thing breaking out during the Omaha hi-lo round.
@TucoBenedict You’re wrong
@GKMcCabe He embraces the misery and relentlessness of a poker tournament *on his birthday*? Best wishes indeed!
The Tuesday poker players are coming early to watch the football. Most irregular. They even hint that if the match isn’t finished, we’ll start late. We haven’t started late in twenty years! On *Tuesday September 11th, 2001* we started on time! I’m concerned they might be ill.
@gordiestirling No no, I’ll go back sooner or later! I hope!
@PaulDiamond3 Happy birthday Paul x
@MQenna It’s coming back! Just later than usual - October/November I think.
@BadMovieBible Aw, it’s sweet
@SargeCraig667 @AberJohnny I remember @barnyboatman asking for a cup of tea at the Bellagio and the waitress saying, “A Heineken?”
@Rusalka343 I know. You could get a real mouse for that.
It’s not your English. We’ve all been there. https://t.co/1sOlE5IIrJ
@k8_rox @DadOfCrazyTwins In the autumn! I think October.
@david_morton7 @duvalljeff @SenseiChanning I don’t think Jeff even *has* cheese. Neil definitely doesn’t. Any gout is a massive tribute to their port consumption.
@duvalljeff @SenseiChanning *sigh*. This is giving me gout envy.
@millyjohnson I hope it went well! Philosophy A-Level would be a brilliant one to do, I wish my school had offered it.
@JulesAttard @AMFrankenberger Yup, I get that question a lot. Closely followed by “She actually looks a bit like you, but thinner”.
@AMFrankenberger You forget “Doesn’t the house always win?” “Show me your poker face” “What’s your nickname?” “Have you ever put your car keys in?”
@leeavy That’s incredibly nice of you, thank you very much.
@bs7909 That sounds like a perfect reaction..
@jondrytay @mollykh @jukevox So you sort of edge nervously along, looking at your feet? I don’t think I’ve ever walked into a party any other way.
@brainychat @RobJFH Oh I disagree. That is very much the best bit.
@paul_mclaughlin So am I.
@bs7909 Delighted to be of service. Ahem.
@staffdb66 Good. You must be in advertising.
@dodofrost Or, now I come to think of it, “a reliable lettings agent”. That also works.
@dodofrost Ooh, you’re right. I didn’t think of that one.
But how rarely the answer would be yes. https://t.co/cNwUC9sKQO
Nope. No good. It only works with beer.
If only this brilliantly sophisticated advertising concept were adaptable to other products. https://t.co/7VzbKcanBK
@paulcarden That’s lovely to hear, thank you.
Thank goodness for the explanatory note. https://t.co/keUZKtoyC8

@Jane_Burrows @OnlyConnectQuiz I like the sound of Emily a great deal.
@Kevmath @victorramdin GG Victor, it’s a beautiful world out here. Time for the next adventure.
@SionelTweet @tomedwardfoster @PhilB1965 Lol. Thanks Steve &amp; Phil. Don’t you worry about me, T Foster, I’m not skint yet 😎
@Rory_Cunningham @andrewdjamieso1  It’s the bit under the headline but above the actual story.
@MarkMurphy66 @ukslim @jondrytay @markfearnley47 That’s brilliant subbing. Of COURSE both those changes should be made.
@ukslim @jondrytay @markfearnley47 Lol. Yes I see. Well how confusing of the sub to mention that blow in the same headline but not *as* a blow.
@NunayaBizniz @Tom_Weir Wrong! The Bale goal is *also* a blow to the Kop because, I discovered, Bale plays for the other team.
@jondrytay @markfearnley47 YES. Otherwise the blow is the worldie by Bale &amp; Salah.
@Tom_Weir Because it’s two things. It’s not one blow. It’s a goal and an injury. I initially understood the “worldie by Bale &amp; Salah” to be the blow.
...and Liverpool is being referred to as “Kop” even though the game was played in Ukraine.
@Argus_JoelA @RealDMitchell Fair point. A bank holiday special!
@twist0161 Where were you an hour ago? This is all very helpful.
@stevenmorrish @jondrytay Well.....
Key information required: a “worldie” is a world-class goal; Salah is injured; Bale and Salah play for different teams; “hits” should be “hit” because these are two different things.
@stevenmorrish @jondrytay It appears again on the next page! In a story about Katie Price’s love life! Does it mean the same thing??? https://t.co/is2CKg5kUF
I don’t think a true football fan could ever understand how baffling this standfirst is for me. Sorry, WHAT happened?! We had to work it out like a cryptic crossword clue. https://t.co/NwhzxXPoiE
(I know it would not be called a “video” by anyone under 75. But I’ve considered various alternatives, and I have a feeling they’re all wrong too.)
Thanks to @roberthudson for sending us this video, which is totally brilliant. And has really got me in the mood for breakfast.  https://t.co/XeqqLR39On
@Tintin75843982 You’re MORE than welcome!! xxx
@richfordbecklow No, but that is an excellent hat.
@MichaelGrantBks Nice hand!
@rtrac3y Well they’re all *that*.
@GrimbisterO Still, that’s excellent critique.
Thank you to @tintin75843982 from Cafe 36 in London NW3, who are not just brilliant bakers but kind, charitable, neighbourly people who are happy to help in a crisis. If everyone was like them, there would be no problems in the world.
@jane_kjane @Tintin75843982 Yes, and it's the second time they've helped - last time it was to arrange a treat for some homeless children. Kristine is just a good, kind, lovely person.
@joshspero “Welcome to the family”? It’s simultaneously the title of a romantic comedy, a class satire, a historical drama and a horror film. I love it.
@Sathnam It’s doing a few things at once, like the cover after Trump’s election (not to compare the two things!). Very *scriptible*; there’s someone great in the Times splash department.
@rowec1 Lol
Hurray! I really hope this all works out and they’re happy for ever. 🎉🎊🌞🌞🌞
@joshspero I think you might’ve missed some levels here? It’s a great cover, I think. A lot is going on.
My husband thinks I should have mentioned that she’s two. It would be less cute if she were, you know, 30.
Commentator: “A lot of stripped-back fashion, a lot of block colour and statement pieces.” My daughter: “That lady has a carroty hat! A rabbit would like it.” A salutary lesson.
@TweeTeWoo How rude! He would never buy anything of the kind.
Excellent. The 2008 (our launch year?) is a ruffle though. In 2008, that would not have been an anagram of my name. I was simple “Carrot Invoice” back then. https://t.co/QJzNotDQoy
@Daneeka @RealDMitchell @BAFTA I really have to learn where the camera bit is on these phones.
@jonronson @iamchrism He told someone who interviewed him in prison. He really liked a series I made about the dictionary. ‘Interesting’, I heard myself think, ‘so he’s not all bad.’
@jonronson He was a big fan of mine. I genuinely have mixed feelings.
@lobster_1 That’s nice, thank you!
@MeMeMe05244837 That’s very nearly as lavish as the real set.
@ollieastokes It’ll be back later in the year!
@SpaceToffee I think they’re different. I know these days you’d rarely find two older women represented at once, but they were more forward-thinking in the early media forms!
@n1colas_cage That might be one for a champions’ special.
@grizzlefur @Spunky_Backpack @1stofthegang @Mr_Egregious That’s what they sent? “If you’re writing to request an application form the next series of Only Connect” ? That can’t be them! Such grammatical infelicities would never slip through! It must be a fraud!
@PhiSmal @OnlyConnectQuiz But but but it’s 2018. That makes my eye twitch
@FrankMPaul @lydmizz I hope you watched Gogglebox. It was very funny.
@job1uk @BrianW189 @thejudijames Thank you!
@BrianW189 @thejudijames No. That wasn’t me. You’re confusing your episodes and people. Please be more careful in future.
@thejudijames @BrianW189 I have no idea what this is about! I haven’t said anything like this. Have you confused me with someone else?
@Mickylurve I’m literally standing and applauding.
@keiththecamel I want to ask him immediately.
Please God they don’t do this with Only Connect. https://t.co/KkJShlwb4l
@Juicius_Maximus WELCOME
@barnyboatman 😳😳😳
@barnyach Yum
@ThatCarterBlunt A persistent thermostat adjuster... that really made me laugh out loud. Just sneakily adjusting it again.
@Nicko147 Ahhhhhhh
@mfharkin Oh that’s lovely.
@petegaley I like that read.
@tommykinda A definite possible.
What is this painting (on a restaurant wall)? My best guess is a smartly dressed lobster adjusting a clock.  But why is it doing that? Why is it all gussied up, fiddling with the time? It’s extremely sinister. I wouldn’t want to be on a date with that lobster. https://t.co/wz6wPYE6cx
@judy_slippers @PhiSmal @QuizQuizQuiz That video does bear a repeat viewing, doesn’t it?
@nkeadon What an excellent young man.
@WhiteHeartTower 💰💰💰
@FrizFrizzle I like the sound of him
@hpstubbs @grizzlefur Great name.
@MrBenGP @grizzlefur Sadly not. Merci tout de meme!
@FrizFrizzle What do you mean? The man outwitted you, pure and simple. There are many ways to win.
@KeithT3103 @grizzlefur Oh nothing like that many. It’s an occasional treat.
@PickleEllie @FrankMPaul LET’S NOT GO MAD
@quickstiles @benmrowe @mslhthomas @PoxonSally @OnlyConnectQuiz @lydmizz @PhiSmal 💖
@lydmizz That would be genuinely brilliant.
@dchassocks Because if we just put the final out without the previous 36 episodes, it would confuse people.
@ChrisBestTwit @benmrowe @OnlyConnectQuiz Haha I love them all. Very nearly 100%.
@benmrowe @OnlyConnectQuiz ..and you’d also have to be watching it like a sort of soap, where the end result is the whole point of the thing, which it isn’t at all. Not even slightly.   I think your negativity is a bit misplaced here, I have to say.
@benmrowe @OnlyConnectQuiz The whole thing was ruined?! You’d have to remember that from December, you’d have to be looking for a code, and then you’d have to think I meant Frank rather than one of the MANY OTHERS I repeatedly lauded in the series - including Phil Small who was also in the final!
@dannyglenn Oh, I did.
@Clare875 I wasn’t even the smartest person on that show.
@richardosman HOW DID YOU GET ON?
@Itsallaboutcake It’s not, but you should still congratulate him for doing it.
@mackenziesboy 18.5 hours
@Mgwjambo @OnlyConnectQuiz GIVE IT A GO
@The_Strovinator @OnlyConnectQuiz What a lovely thing to hear! Thankyou!
@MargaretBeagle1 Me too.
@MikeMcK1980 Prolly not.
@SirArthurIndeed You won’t be disappointed.
20 minutes into the 2k side event and I’m desperate for a shot clock. I take it all back. Get on with it already!
@iamezekiel1_14 @lukeredpath No I can have anything, but the BB should not be beating the SB here, that’s his problem. Nobody made a terrible mistake though, it’s just the cards didn’t go according to statistics.
@WhitearBruce Basically yes.
@leahdan1 @BettingJury Haha I DO take it as a compliment, I’m grateful for what I can get, but also BettingJury is right, they COULD NOT BE less interested. We’re all too driven by greed and gamble.
Ah well. I think I can fairly say I didn’t make a mistake.... that’s gambling.
Interesting. With blinds 1k-2k it was a straightforward move all-in for me with 25k and AA. The small blind had 15k and called with 22. The big blind had plenty and felt he should call behind with A6. What a lovely spot! Except it came 66.  That’s the kind of thing I don’t miss.
@barnyboatman @BennyG444 If you’re in the 1 seat or the 9 seat, there’s one stack you can’t see BECAUSE of the shot clock!
@RyanRiess1 🎻
Grrr. There was no avoiding getting it all in with a fairly short-stacked Ryan Riess when he had AA and I had JJ... or if there was avoiding it, I didn’t. An annoyingly costly skirmish.
Anyway. 296 left of 661 original players. Let’s see how fast the “shot clock” can make this...
Some people (especially non English speakers) will have hands mucked today for reasons they don’t understand. They’ll feel like it’s an injustice. Those are exactly the people you need to keep happy and enjoying themselves for the good of poker. There. That’s my two-pennorth.
It also feels like it benefits the young professional players more than the confused, older, recreational players (like me 😎). Whether it does or not, FEELING like it does is bad for the game.
Hmm. From day 2, this tournament has a “shot clock” so every decision has to be made in 30 seconds. I’m a quick player myself but I don’t like this for a main event. Poker is a slow, crafty game; a cricket for the mind. This bends too much to the impatience of the iPhone world.
@Philippa_Perry That's basically what poker is anyway.
@andrew_scobbie Neither is at all important.
@Shillibier I doubt it. It’s hard enough to get a cup of tea.
@Josh_More Not sure if you mean Only Connect or poker tournaments - but in both cases, both. You go round and round, sometimes bafflingly, and at some point get knocked out. But if everyone else gets knocked out before you, you’ve won.
I’ll be going back to the poker tournament in an hour or so - but it’s only Day 2. Unlike the Escapologists and the Belgophiles, I haven’t MADE THE FINAL!  (8pm on BBC Two) https://t.co/U4kDpjOxbS
@lydmizz @OnlyConnectQuiz It’s lovely she thought you’d be disappointed. For most people, that brief window of delight is soon to be shattered.
@Shillibier Aw thank you!
@MCarruthersWatt Fair point.
@Elizabe86553130 It does if you play poker.
@kalkers That's nice! Thank you.
@mmize79 ...from the screaming.
@RobbieF83 Lol. I'm definitely going to say "your go.. your go" whenever the action's on somebody else.
@mini_zerk123 Um.... a boxing trainer?
@kevinlyons67 I mean, quite.
@HollinsHolly She’s a chip off the old... no wait, that’s not an appropriate joke.
@seanrostron Well he’s got the whole of the REST of the day (hopefully) to worry about...
@Banjobetty3 Excellent point.
@EleanorDacq9 That’s the real game.
Of course, what I DON’T know is what percentage of the field will be woken up in about five hours’ time by a merry two-year-old in the cot next to their bed, expecting breakfast and 28 rounds of “penguin pairs”.   I suppose it’ll be obvious when I look round the room tomorrow.
@hammerharp No idea. Too early to think about that sort of thing!
Whee, through to day 2! I think about half the field have gone through? Something like that. Average chips 73k, I have 96k. Luckily some of the rules have remained the same 😎
@hkh_uk Oh thank you! That’s lovely to hear. Well, it’s all much the same but I’m happier these days...
@madginger92 Ooh good point
@cacklingjamble I’m horrifying myself. But there’s still half an hour to sort things out.
@alanmcguinn WHAT IS THAT PLACE? IT SOUNDS AMAZING
@Stapes Aw, ty x
I’ve had a bit of a rally on my new table, now up to 70k in chips (average 66k). 45 minutes left of play tonight. I’m in two minds, as Day 2 starts at midday and we’d identified a really nice place to have lunch. #priorities
@nick1austin @alexinpaca Beautifully summarised.
@Matchtalk @Jeremy_Nicholas @ISIHAClue Of course it is!
Ah, the international language of poker overheard on the dinner break! “River kommt koenig...” “Ich habe quads gefloppt...” Unmistakeable.
@AlibonRichard Not that one. Somerset Maugham.
@jimgrim747 Tricky in this field. Nobody’s over 25.
@SenseiChanning Today in a restaurant, some people were friendly and welcoming to us! Just goes to show, hope is always alive.
(If you don’t know the story of the appointment in Samarra, do look it up. It’s only about two paragraphs long and it’s great.)
Well this is different from yesterday, in the sense that I’ve had a couple of big hands, aces and kings. But it’s the same, in the sense that they’ve both lost. Sometimes a tournament can be like the Appointment in Samarra.  But let’s see.
@jimineuropa I’m drinking a cup right now as it goes.
@exitthelemming Genius
@janinegibson You didn’t win ANY of them?
@selfmadeheroes Nah
Hmm. Two jacks not as good a hand as it was when I last played. Luckily they’ve split the old buy-in price into two parts so you get to have another go. I think I will! Maybe tomorrow though.
@StartPlayer @Frenzies I think people give more action when they’ve put in an ante and can see a pile of them there.
@Frenzies @Glinner @sezlilbet Well it’s not a blind - the ante part of it is dead. I assume the idea is to speed the action up, so you get the same amount in the pot without the dealer having to hassle every player to remember the ante. But actually I think it’s bad for the game.
@sezlilbet @Glinner Me neither
@Glinner It means, in theory each player pays (eg. 25) each as an ante, per hand, but in practice the big blind pays 200. So you pay the same amount per round but it only applies on one hand.
@Glinner Meh, this and that. Early antes but the big blind pays for everybody. And a re-entry! Different approach required.
@jonathansmout I will if I win it lol.
Well, they changed the blinds anyway. Still, it’ll be fun to give em a spin. I’ll remember the hang of it. But I suspect, for the first couple of events, I might be the value. https://t.co/hSFYabI6Mu
I’m playing a POKER TOURNAMENT! How retro is that? My first in nearly a year. “Remind me of the rules!” I quipped as I sat down. Turns out they literally have changed the rules.
@AndyLukas @OnlyConnectQuiz No, it’s on Monday!
@Craft_Workshops Ok yes that’s actually more frightening. I thought that was impossible.
@davidphw There was no car park? How was anybody supposed to get there?
@m_volestrangler That’s an optimistic read.
And who fancies going for a stroll in the garden by night...? https://t.co/8E4rTVXpdg
@QuizQuizQuiz @joeisgraham @lydmizz @GemmaKimbo My intention is never to penalise people for not knowing how to pronounce words, though with certain missing vowel clues this is indistinguishable from just getting it wrong. If you said “Eaves” instead of “Eavis” here, I think we would have to deduct a point.
@finnlawrence Oh dear. God forbid a buyer gets those two confused.
@RedVRover @OnlyConnectQuiz We never do more than one take. We can barely afford chairs.
@simoninthelakes @Banjobetty3 Ah, that one was Humph era.
@SallyEBrien Sadly, the resemblance doesn’t end there.
@TitusRadio Thank you! My hero 💋
@Trumpetmike @ISIHAClue Well played!
@lydmizz @aidybidd @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBC ...and me watching.
@lydmizz @aidybidd @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBC I mean, let’s be clear: there were six brilliant people on the show tonight.
@aidybidd @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBC I really like the way you mean “joke” as a compliment, I’m going to use that in future. @FrankMPaul
@WirralSpur1882 @ClulessChris Well if you’re going to be pedantic, I think you’ll find it’s Roy Scheider not Schneider...
Also on Only Connect tonight, as well as blue artistic blood [cerulean...?]: spot the quote from I’m Sorry I Haven’t A Clue, the quiz before which we’ll always kneel.
@JudgeRoySnyder Well that’s because the more remarkable thing about Emma Laslett is her AMAZING QUIZ SKILLS. She’ll be back next series for a “family special” so let’s see if she’s as brilliant as ever...
The second Only Connect semi-final is at 8pm on BBC Two! It features the return of Frank Paul, whom viewers will remember fondly from previous episodes. Here’s an interesting fact about Frank that we never got round to mentioning in the opening remarks:  https://t.co/oUncUk5k6t
@packagingman What do you mean? I'm celebrating her two fingers to the ad agency.
@The_Steph_ Perhaps that's them being satirical...
@cat_people Do you mean JK Galbraith? It’s a weird one - easy if you don’t think of the economist JK Galbraith, but nearly impossible if you do!
@AndyB2007 I wish I’d seen it now.
Delighted to see the woman in this advert has ignored its ridiculous message. https://t.co/TYJn8qxXwR
@GamblingComp Thank you for having me, I had a lovely time!
@e2_edward @AngelaBarnes I mean, it really is.
@theAliceRoberts @Adastra10 @_JamesReid_ Lol
@TriWidow @GamblingComp Oh thank you!! It was lovely to meet you tonight.
@drsas27 @miran_mufc @OnlyConnectQuiz Well compared to that, surgical exams are a breeze! Good luck with both.
@Jimlad3 There will be another one starting in a few months!
@NickEd82 I didn’t understand why anyone said it was easy, but then a friend said he had never heard of JK Galbraith. So it wasn’t a red herring! If you’re thinking of the actual JK Galbraith it’s nigh impossible not to take a second clue..
@CopleyHill @ScorpioSting72 @jaxd38 @FionnaidhH365 @RealDMitchell @DavidLammy This is a lovely exchange.
@StBustier @FranS199 @valmcdermid @richardosman I never get involved in this sort of thing but you should tweet @Cynical_Dreemer and tell him that! It’s not where I bought it but he seems nice and wanted to know for his partner.
@philchappell We don't even award a prize for winning the series.
@Clive__Horn In the early stages of the tournament I'd get a few. At this stage, I'd be very happy with one or two! I'm good at the missing vowels though.
@alanmcguinn Well done indeed.
So, one Only Connect semi final is completed! If you’d prefer me to ask easier questions (like “Is this World War 3?”), try Have I Got A Bit More News For You at 10.45pm on BBC One.
@hwallop No apology necessary!
@mummikins No, that was the connection: real first name, pseudonymous surname. It applied to all the clues, not just “Emily Bell”!
@WalkTheLinesLDN @hwallop Good work there, Mark!
OH LOOK! NOT MY FAULT! NOT MY FAULT! https://t.co/uPPxqC371V
@Boringscience ...but enough about my hair.
Let me just get in early to say I have no idea why I pronounced Beaconsfield like that. A moment of madness.
@TrevorMLambert @OnlyConnectQuiz Yes, I don't know where that came from.
@DocCrom @OnlyConnectQuiz Happy Easter!
@preservation76 DON'T
@Banjobetty3 No, they correctly said it began with the real name and finished with the pseudonym. They just hadn't mentioned the gender aspect.
@JamesDrapper SHE HAS MY FULL SUPPORT
@AmySeaker @DavidLammy Well, both of ours!
This is just brilliant and heartfelt rhetoric from @DavidLammy. My grandparents came here too. If we’re not British, I don’t know what we are.    https://t.co/SxnEMJIqh3
@Tringonometry @AnonymousBill2 Lol
@tcmoon THANK YOU
@jsklfc @OnlyConnectQuiz No! It’s joyful! Come out from under the duvet and toast the brilliance, vulnerability and pluck of the human condition!
@Tringonometry @AnonymousBill2 I didn’t say slutty. I just said librarian in a porn film. The character may be a chaste voyeur or innocent passer-by! I never specified.
@pieist @jamesvogl Do people do that...?
My friend @jamesvogl is planning a London club for people interested in ideas - it's not launching yet but they're having a festival day of talks, games, classes and social events to give a flavour. Tickets here (but I get in free because I'm taking part!) https://t.co/2pycVGjHKy
@TerryWhenman That’s a very touching message. Thank you very much for your kind words.
@derdriui @valmcdermid @richardosman There was more and worse about Boris Johnson. You have selective hearing.
@LeeFergusson Thank you!
@RosieCheeksB Well, thank you. I've deleted my message.
@downtondreamer @mainlykirby That's nice! When I was at school, I used to watch Dynasty while talking to my friend Joanna on a land line. THAT'S HOW OLD I AM.
@keiththecamel Thank you! x
@richardosman @The_Indexer @indexers @valmcdermid Lol
@katiephipps @NikitaCatSpeaks @Jeremysquire Thank you!
@Lateralus_51 I know I know, I'm sorry.
@The_Indexer @indexers @richardosman @valmcdermid I never thought it was up to me! I assumed publishers decide that kind of thing. I'll know next time!
@NikitaCatSpeaks @katiephipps @Jeremysquire I need them to read things that are far away.
@Jeremysquire @NikitaCatSpeaks No, there isn't an autocue on Only Connect at all. I'm just talking. That's why I don't need glasses!
@indexers @The_Indexer @richardosman @valmcdermid Mine don't! #travesty
@gracelizabeth3 Aw, that's nice
@mint_i_am @Billo20Four7 Tell her to be careful! That's not where I got it from and I paid about £30.
@mariamcerlane THANK you xxx
@indexellis @PC_Bain @The_Indexer @indexers Me? I love Indexers! Absolutely my kind of guys.
@rdasroni If you take things that seriously, I’m not sure comedy panel shows are the best genre for you anyway!
@EmmaKennedy @Andrew_Holt @valmcdermid @richardosman @realDonaldTrump I do 😎
@Gary_P_Jackson @valmcdermid @richardosman ...but enough about the show.
@pauliopool @valmcdermid @richardosman Paul Merton?
Despite the imminence of World War Three, I think it'll be a surprisingly JOLLY episode of #HaveIGotNewsForYou tonight. I'm the guest host, alongside lovely guest contestants @valmcdermid and @richardosman. 9.30pm on BBC One.
@EdinJag @valmcdermid What happens if we interrupt each other?
@garybrightside @DjBrightside1 Clearly one glass wasn’t enough.
@Lgbt_lawyer @OnlyConnectQuiz Happy birthday!
@noodleflute @OnlyConnectQuiz @mlg1611 For all I know, that might be part of the official structure.
@JD_MacGill That’s very nice of you! Thank you!
@_Miss_Spelled Yes! Burning a card is part of the action, whatever you do with the deck.
@dj85ftm I'm afraid not, and it was before!
@MargaretBeagle1 @stackers91 I'm chuffed when I remember the name of the programme.
@stackers91 It’s impossible to over-estimate how much pride you should take in that!
@Jasonm25870 Truth is I don’t really do autographs anyway - I feel they’re for proper stars, you know, film stars and singers. Sorry! Thanks anyway.
@gladtobeblake I’m not involved at that level of editing but I don’t think so!
@littledragonboy Oh goodness, I’d love to help but that’s nigh impossible - it totally depends on the 18 year old! And the best reason to read is for pleasure. I guess: if they/you haven’t read The Catcher In The Rye, try that.
@jeckythump @shangadge @OnlyConnectQuiz @lydmizz @tomrowell8 @FrankMPaul I’m nervous to comment for fear of leading people to spoilers (spoiler avoiders: don’t check thread!) but you’re all brilliant, well played.
@Jasonm25870 This photo of me at 8 months pregnant? Thank you but I wish people would stop using it, it was three years ago and feels a bit weird!
@LifeBeautyLens @OnlyConnectQuiz Aw thank you!
@mistymaria We discuss it sometimes. We might do it one day!
@alicemurphypyle I WOULD
@TonyCerff Thank you! If you start next series at the beginning, it’s a bit more gettable. Not much. But a bit.
@Fankle That is basically going to happen next year.
@sparkeja In a very real sense, nobody.
@keirshiels !! That’s incredibly nice of you. Then I saw your biog says “four parts gin”. It all falls into place.
T-30 for the last quarter final. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. https://t.co/GzXHzmPOJO
@mainlykirby It’s like looking in a mirror.
@nicolahunt987 I’ve seen one. I promise it wouldn’t help.
Last quarter final of Only Connect is on tonight at 8pm on BBC Two. So it’s a last chance to make the semi finals! Or escape them.
@fundfuriosa @OnlyConnectQuiz The production manager thought much the same thing about me during series 11.
@ChristGod @andybryant1 @CharlieMawer @aphlex Excellent tenacity.
@ChristGod @andybryant1 @CharlieMawer @aphlex Is that from this week? Or an old one?
@TRJHobart We couldn’t risk awakening the wrath of the powerful Crossworders.
@hannahbird I mean, why DON’T we have a birthday card segment? That would be brilliant. Hope it’s a lovely day.
@millyjohnson Bon appetit!
@Chris_Iddon97 @AJMartinSky @HatTrickProd Thanks for tweeting that link - I’d forgotten I wrote that but I must say I agree with myself!
@rightsmartdan @taylofabi #SoToSpeak
@Ian_Hislam I think he was talking about politicians, wasn’t he? It’s being misquoted a bit.
@DOUGIETHOMPSON @allisonpearson Didn’t I say they owned both (like Northcliffe and Mail)? I meant to!
@dancinteddie 🍾
@srw647 WE DON’T SPEAK.
@taylofabi That’s nice! Thank you very much.
@jeckythump @shangadge Don’t do it! I don’t want to be responsible for any more pain!
@Miss_F_Rosler 🍾🍾🍾
@hurricanehorton @LiamPR87 @OnlyConnectQuiz I'm not.
@Glloyd1965 Well that's obviously the best film ever made, so you can't be faulted.
@sloughtownrebel So you should be.
@lukerigg He's lovely too. THEY'RE ALL LOVELY.
@DeanoB24 I'M NOT TELLING YOU.
Oh I do love Mick Lee. Truly, madly, Mick Lee.
@CrooksClare Oh I’m sorry! Get well soon!
Easter Monday is a happy, celebratory, family occasion. Nevertheless, Only Connect is on. (8pm, BBC Two).
@sarah_barnett68 @RealDMitchell I’ll remember today. I’ve put notes all round the house.
@thefuffa Happy Easter!
@LupeBrown91 @OnlyConnectQuiz I think that literally every time a music question starts. What a compilation! No idea if it exists; not officially, certainly.
@alexinpaca But you don’t have to understand things to accept them. Did you read the interview? These two people were unhappy and lost, now they’re happy and found. That seems all good to me.
@emilycelebrant Your Twitter photo [avatar?] is lovely!
@Muttistopheles No - I mean, I read it in the actual printed newspaper, then found a link. I never really read papers online.
@BinTwoPadstow Yes, the part about the commanding officer was incredibly moving, I found.
@chinmj Ooh “, good clarification.
@PlcFred Well, I suppose they will have felt lonely and frightened as children because they didn’t see anyone like themselves, so they’re trying to make a less lonely world. I don’t know them personally but I’d bet money on it being a kindly, generous instinct rather than a bad one!
@sue_simmonds Me too, I got terribly snivelly.
@chinmj I’ve never understood that one.
(Nb. I say “No point preaching to the converted” on the eve of Easter Sunday, when I’m delighted to note that vicars will be doing that everywhere! It’s one of those rare phrases that’s only useful metaphorically.)
This couple threw the dice when they chose the Mail for their interview but it’s a really lovely, moving, gently-written piece. A good return on their bravery: no point preaching to the converted, this is the kind of gamble that can change the world.  https://t.co/8c3czcHTQG
@MardySnowflake @alexlumaga Are people saying it’s unfair? I didn’t take it as serious theological analysis, I just think it’s a funny bit of dialogue.
@exitthelemming Amaretto?
@exitthelemming Ahhhhhh... thank you for that x
@janelinley42 @OnlyConnectQuiz She sounds *wonderful*. I can’t wait to meet her in 20 years’ time.
@rolyatyug @DougPolkPoker It’s very kind of you to remember - I miss those days (and money...) so I’m glad some people do! But, to be fair, some people just aren’t trouble-makers. If everyone was as stubborn and opinionated as me, the world wouldn’t be a better place ;-)
@WGSfilms That’s an excellent limerick.
@Hedgeees There are many question writers - you’ll find the chief ones and editors at @QuizQuizQuiz - but the answer is that K represents the king in chess notation, so the knight gets N.
@The_Strovinator That’s nice to hear! I’m glad it didn’t drive you over the edge.
@ichigo84 Your relationship sounds excellent.
@sue6point7nl That’s definitely justified!
@BurnleyFanzine @MelMelwing12 There is no audience! I like my jokes to be met with silence; it’s what I’m used to.
@DoctorT1992 @1980Worldchamp That’s a question for @QuizQuizQuiz ...
@AlexJCall That’s nice! Thank you very much! I was very impressed by Frank in that moment, I must say. (And in general!)
@Lgbt_lawyer @OnlyConnectQuiz I don’t know, I think there used to be one, not sure what happened with it.
@1980Worldchamp IT IS A BELL
@nickdork65 It was absolutely sterling work from Ben, a moment of valiance that I *vigorously* salute.
@Sturdygirl0803 SEE YOU NEXT YEAR
@PhiSmal Phil, you're a hero.
@MelMelwing12 I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU
@PoxonSally NO COMMENT.
@EmmaKennedy I mean, one day we WILL make that episode.
Thanks to all the people who guessed it was me with the hangover... but actually, for once, it’s someone else! https://t.co/rYAEuBacsT
What links The Krankies and The White Stripes? Tonight on Only Connect (8pm on BBC Two), six brilliant quizzers attempt to work it out.  See if you can spot from the opening shots which one of them is very hungover.
@dtheherring Thanks very much.. maybe one day!
@Katt_Hx Was it June Brown?
@HandsomeMollyUK Excellent work.
@samuel_pollen @felicefan Oops
@felicefan I'm glad you didn't copy him in. If he's anything like me, that would have caused a really unhappy, sleepless night.
I don't know this guy, but I strongly approve of the way he spends his time. https://t.co/8VszeBlOgk
@mauddykins @Harry_M_Orme @OnlyConnectQuiz YES I DO
@GeorgetheHall Haha not embarrassing at all. Will you be there again tomorrow? If so, do say hello!
@trurocabbie Well, that is what I meant by dinner.
Lots of messages about this... Yup, the wrong one was played and it’s UNDER REVIEW. Not my fault though: I always spend the music question thinking about my dinner. (Mind you, that also applies to all the other questions.) https://t.co/jRIy1lIwRU
@ramilles It will never end.
@StefanMichal Both.
@LindeanLad That’s nice! Thank you.
@smilinglaura @DavidAntCooper @YorkshireYank Me too.
@voodoobluesman Yes! That is why!
@jnrsoccercoach @ClareStacey73 I didn’t see it, so I don’t remember what it was! But thank you!
@helenbennett87 Oh that is impressive. I think it was after.
@djfelix It would be the highlight of my year. I’m not sure I’ve EVER got one...
Two lovely and brilliant teams on Only Connect tonight, Vikings v Inquisitors - and look out for a VERY funny remark at the wall from Luke of The Inquisitors. I've been laughing about it ever since the recording. (8pm, BBC Two)
@reginalddhunter @SummerDormouse Yes, obviously it's no good if we ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT POKER zzzz but as long as that bit was brief and we talked about other stuff, it would be great! Tiny snippets of life....
@SummerDormouse @reginalddhunter That’s actually an amazing idea for a show. Ten-minute episodes. Let’s do it Reg x
@LucyLucifer82 YES but you have to make them yourselves out of foil.
@alfiemoore You must feel so used.
@AidanSproat @thelazycreative Oh good! I wondered if you’d see that tweet. But of course; everyone’s better at the internet than I am.
@Williams_James @OnlyConnectQuiz Sorry... we do try to avoid spoilers, but I think we assumed that children of Butterfly-Lion-reading age aren’t also Only Connect viewers... it’s the price you pay for a prodigy!
@MrShaneReaction Oh, good picture
@NickLW Well done!
@garry_crew @OnlyConnectQuiz I like the sound of her.
@thedjnana1968 I know, I know.
What might you do when you're angry? Find out in round 4 of a VERY TENSE EPISODE of Only Connect - starting in ten minutes on BBC Two.
Is this good? https://t.co/fNdwMsNLIo
@JamieJampot @8Outof10Cats @C4Countdown @OnlyConnectQuiz Lol I hope not. Thanks for the nice comments though!
@sylviabellini Truth is, I admire them. But I’ll never be one of them.
@Argentologist That tweet is like a great, tiny short story. Probably by Graham Greene.
@radioheadjen Ah, mothers in law... she sounds amazing. Mine, thank God, sees the world in much the same way I do.
“Between washes, vacuum curtains once a week from top to bottom using the upholstery tool on your vacuum cleaner”.  Hahahahahahahaha
@Peterkin You don’t need to. My washing machine’s been going fine for about 15 years and I’ve never done that. Just wipe the filter every few months when you remember.
@mrandyreynolds That’s not my husband.
The Times: “Wash your apron after every use, at 60C.” I mean, please. https://t.co/0bjqKZgCuW
I mean, if that were really necessary then we’d all be suffering from bacterial poisoning all the time. Have you ever been made ill by an unwashed cloth? I think I might keep on gambling.
Today’s Times says that hand towels, kitchen cloths and aprons should be washed every day. EVERY DAY! Does anybody do that? Literally anyone at all?
@GWRHelp Thanks Lewis. I wish I’d known this a fortnight ago, I’d have made other plans completely. Oh well. Hopefully we’re nearly there. My dream is, by Monday, to have a ticket and a seat...
@shufgy @GWRHelp I know... I’m sorry... Of course, Only Connect fans will tell you that watching me do almost anything is painful.
@GWRHelp Wow. I'm phoning again to have another go and today the 13.37 has disappeared! It was available last night and it's gone again now! Now all the trains all day are 3 and a half hours. Do you know if it's going to change again? This is madness!
@GWRHelp Thanks Rachel. But I phoned an hour ago and tried to book a seat (actually on the 13.37) and Tom on the phone said seats could not be booked. Ah well! I’ll try again tomorrow! At least I didn’t buy a ticket last Friday for the 12.37 that they promised was definitely running....
@GWRHelp Hi Andy! Just tried phoning. Tom at GWR told me the 12.37 (the train many previous operatives have offered to sell me a ticket for, without a seat reservation) is now not running at all. I could buy a ticket for 11.35 or 13.37 but no seat reservations are available. *sigh* ???
@duke_nicola @OnlyConnectQuiz We know that! It’s N in chess notation, because K is reserved for the king.
@herne_kzn HUNDREDS OF THEM. That's ok. I'm here to explain!
@peterclemit @ChrisPalmer001 @mischawatson Aw, I do think the original tweeter was just having a laugh.
@GWRHelp Grrr well thanks very much for your help (again!). I've said another goodbye to the GWR phone team and I'll try again on Friday. Hopefully it will be up by then. I'm sure you feel the same...
@Mattjohnsons @GWRHelp Lol
@GWRHelp OK thank you - last question - you don't have any idea when it will be uploaded?
@GWRHelp He also says they CAN'T CONFIRM that there won't be a replacement bus service! He says "we won't know till nearer the time" !! ??? Is he right or are you right?
@GWRHelp Ah - hello - I'm literally on the phone to GWR now, to David, who's very nice but he is telling me reservations will NOT become available! He says the National Rail Enquiries website tells him that there will be engineering works and they won't be releasing tickets.
@GWRHelp Hello Andy. This (above) was your advice on February 23rd but it seems reservations still haven't been released. Do you know why this is, or what's the best thing to do?
@GWRhelp Hello again. I'm now being told seats will NEVER BECOME AVAILABLE on London-Cardiff trains on the weekend of March 24th/25th. For three weeks they've been saying "try again next Friday", but they now say trains will run without seats being bookable at all. Is that right?
@peterclemit @OnlyConnectQuiz !! We know that. It's N in chess notation, because K is reserved for the king.
@TheOtherTracyM @johnpayne92 We couldn't do that! They're ALL my favourites! Having said that, we've got a good selection coming back for some specials next year.
@n1colas_cage @johnpayne92 Haha I can imagine you've had a few messages too.
@johnpayne92 Also, congratulations on inspiring an *unprecedented* level of drooling. It’s like you’re catnip to men. Don’t get me wrong, you’re handsome and charming, I shouldn’t be surprised - but we’ve had lots of gorgeous quizzers and I haven’t seen anything like this in ten years. ♥️
@johnpayne92 What a lovely series of messages! I’d retweet them but they’d be spoilers for late viewers.. thanks for being a lovely contestant.
@Suziet77 Oh dear, sorry for being confusing!
@Red_Hattie Oh, you know which one it would be.........
Lots of comments still flooding in about an Only Connect question where N represented a chess knight... not an error; they do this in chess notation because K stands for the king!
@MikeH252 In chess notation, it’s N. K is used for the king.
@ianb66 @OnlyConnectQuiz But so does king. Hence, N represents the knights.
@LoveSpanner Oh probably.
Are you having a lovely day? Well put that out of your mind, Only Connect is on at 8pm on BBC Two.
@TomAngst Don’t play online blackjack.
@KaraOTR Well let me know if you're ever passing through and fancy lunch xxx
@KaraOTR Oh wow, I may have missed some earlier news - that’s totally brilliant, I’m so happy for you xxx and not just about the coffee part
@bernardlhughes @OnlyConnectQuiz Ohh! I thought you meant in this week’s episode! Not TEN YEARS AGO. Yes, a different world in many ways...
@bernardlhughes @OnlyConnectQuiz Et tu, Bernard! I NEVER give a point in that round if they get it wrong!
@58Cymru IN SPIRIT.
Happy St David’s Day! They’re under there somewhere...... https://t.co/g68fU0Kp3k
@MustafaMirza14 Probably, but it's not till April - I've got to do a TV thing first.
@mslhthomas @rafanapa They showed me one once. It just made things worse.
@ultrachef1 Oh no
@faywil37 WHY WOULDN’T YOU?
@DocCrom AN UNPRECEDENTED TURN OF EVENTS. Anyone would be surprised.
@super_matt2 The AI version is better at it.
@Stephen__Hillis @OnlyConnectQuiz Well I was.
@CRiedlinger77 Is that a euphemism?
@rafanapa It may never end.
@rayscorep No! Of course not!
@janinegibson  https://t.co/vTCgv8QZZr
I ENJOYED THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION ENORMOUSLY.  Good background facts, @jackwc
@a_real_gent You didn't rewind and look at his face, did you?
@timpaa @EmilyWeeble Haha don't take it too seriously. IMAGINE what that plot summary would sound like to someone who hadn't read it!
@a_real_gent Rewind and look at Rob Cromarty's face. IT SPEAKS FOR MILLIONS, I'm sure!
@spicersgot1 lol
@VanessaSteer1 @DocCrom Yes, come on Rob Cromarty!
Ooh, it's the one where two married couples play against each other! I like that one. I think I'll watch. (Starting now on BBC2).
@kingof__fools Lol
@MagicalLorna It would be too cruel to inflict Only Connect on someone in their moment of weakness. Please send him my best wishes for a speedy recovery and a return to the horrors of the quiz!
@footexplain They say so! Yay!
@toimhseachan A guy reminded me. I'm very grateful.
If you thought today wasn't cold enough already, the icy chill of ONLY CONNECT is coming your way. 8pm on BBC Two.
@okitlogo Dammit! Thank you! I'll tweet now!
@nickdork65 I'm afraid there's no such thing as tickets for Only Connect. Members of the public aren't allowed that near me, for fear of the truth emerging.
@JzBun @__fullflush1__ That wasn’t me.
@__fullflush1__ How am I not in this list? #sexism
@mikewallis11 @Eluned_Parrott Nope, you can't. I just phoned GWR. The times still aren't confirmed, the seats still can't be booked, the trains still might change completely.
@david_mitchell @BanterMachtFrei @BeeBoggle ! Hello. I didn’t know you were on Twitter; amazing it doesn’t happen more often. In real life, it’s *very* frequent....
@Eluned_Parrott Sadly it’s not that simple. You still can’t reserve a seat on any of those trains, which the sales people tell me means they aren’t guaranteed to be running at all. It’s a kind of maybe.
@jpaulhunter Well that’s great! Congratulations!
@Eryn_Turner7 I found Kipling’s poem If a pretty handy guide. And then, if the bad beats/exits upset you for too long afterwards, poker may not be for you..
@Zingfoyle Lol
@chaterfranks LOVELY
@GWRHelp Ok thanks Andy. Someone else on the phone said there might be a bus between Swindon and Gloucester. I understand this isn't GWR's fault as they don't control the track but hopefully some pressure is being exerted, people all over the country are needing to make plans!
@GWRHelp Thanks but when will it be confirmed? These tickets are for someone who can't get on and off replacement buses, and other arrangements have to be made for further transport - we might not even be able to go on that date, depending on timetable - when will we be able to plan?!
How can the railways not know if trains are running between London and Cardiff on the weekend of March 24th? That's only a month away! These are two capital cities! When will they decide? And how? Is it a coin toss? Can I bet on it?
@GWRHelp Hello again. I'm being told that GWR STILL don't know whether trains are running between London and Cardiff on March 24th and 25th. It's only a month away! People have to plan things! When will we know?!
@brightaliking That’s great! Good luck.
@Mattjohnsons DELICIOUS. And the tea looks nice ;-)
@keiththecamel I did mean that. This all goes very well with your avatar.
@zippygwr I seriously can’t be that orange. The colour balance must be off on someone’s TV.
@steve_dinneen ! It certainly isn’t.
@keiththecamel Oh dear.......... xx
@keiththecamel WHY SO MISERLY WITH THE DETAILS.....?
@kat_lawrenson IT MAKES A MARVELLOUS COASTER
@RowanTheQuiz I've started to wonder if anyone will ever be knocked out again.
@doccynzl I can’t really tell from that article and the little film doesn’t show the whole hand. It sounds like a good call, though it doesn’t sound like the ‘ballsiest call of all time’ !
@texspex No, it's on the other side of the room!
@evilniamh @FrankMPaul (ironic that the second one would be "stori telling" when the first is "spelling it like it is". I mean.................)
@evilniamh MORE THAN ONE? Tori Spelling?! I have to copy @FrankMPaul into that too, now. If she can bang out two more, we've got a sequence question.
@PhoebeJoy19 Yay! Happy Monday!
@CravenConsLtd I'm always moonlighting. Just not as a beauty therapist...
@texspex What? They each have a screen to look at with the clues on, that's what they're looking at.
@evilniamh Ooh, that's not nearly as good. Should've consulted @FrankMPaul
@Tonionio You're very kind.
Hmm. I like that intro but, at time of recording, I didn't quite mean it to follow the Winter Olympics!
@AngelKneale I should hope so! Nobody should ever watch Only Connect on their birthday. It's like the opposite of a balloon. I hope you both have a lovely festive evening.
@mikeyohara85 I didn't, but people do suggest it from time to time.... we may well do this at some point!
@Brumstevieboy1 That was my pitch for the programme title. I was overruled.
@PoeticJustice23 If you have, then you are.
@smallprintsays If I could explain it, I would, I promise. I think next series it will be easier for me to understand.
@lydmizz Thank you! Luckily, the reminders have come in this week...
On tonight's Only Connect, there's an awkward moment for a maths teacher...... But not for me, because I remembered it's on! 8 o'clock, BBC Two!
@LozTaylor @staceybruce89 Well, however you define it, I am definitely a gambler ;-)
@tom7778882 Of course not. It would be pointless if we made them up!
@QueerGiraffe Ah no, sadly I won't get to that one.
@keiththecamel Oh not for ages - we discussed it already! You said you might play too........ But that's after some filming. It makes for a long break from writing columns.
No Observer column from me today! I’m having a break for a few weeks to do a couple of other projects and play a poker tournament. Wheee it feels like the school holidays.
@SeanVsInternet DO IT!
@Eierdopj3 Yes I think I was there then - but not in the MGM!
@TheRebelTreble @ArfMeasures @wildethingy Close enough.
@GWRHelp Oh well that would be fine! Thank you - you seem to know MASSIVELY more than the people on the phone! But last thing, if it’s still a direct train why can’t I reserve a seat? Do you think I’d be able to in a week’s time? I don’t want to leave it too long because the prices go up!
@dabe1971 @GWRHelp Thank you very much. But the person on the phone said there’d be bus replacement services, they just didn’t know where or what! If it’s still just one train, how come I can’t book a seat?!
@McLeanAmy No no it’s fine! It’s not a secret! I had a lucid dream last night, funnily enough.
@GWRHelp 2/2 Also, will it still be a direct train or will it involve other trains or buses? I need an arrival time AND journey details before I can book it! How do I know if it's the right train to get otherwise?! And do you know why I can't book a seat? It's so confusing!
@GWRHelp Hi Rachel - but only add *what* to the journey time?! Phone operatives at GWR are selling tickets for the 12.37 saying it will arrive at 14.58, is that right? - if it'll be different by more than 20 minutes, they shouldn't really be selling them on that basis! 1/2
@GWRhelp 2/2 ... when I push it on the phone, two managers have said there IS no direct train that day due to engineering works, it'll be replacement buses, but can't give me any details of the replacement journey or arrival time. It's only a month away! Why is it such a muddle?!
@GWRhelp Can anyone tell me what's happening between London and Cardiff on March 25th? On the phone, GWR keep saying they can sell me a ticket but not reserve a seat, though they ASSURE me (as does National Rail website) that the train timetable is running as normal. BUT ... 1/2
@McLeanAmy How did you know that?! I didn’t think I’d talked about it. But yes I sometimes do and it certainly wasn’t training, just happens by itself sometimes and has done ever since I was a teenager.
@daminotaur Oh! Well, I like Bob Dylan. Despite seeing him live. But I’d have been more excited if a British poet had won...
@daminotaur What?
@boorman_david YRVRY WLCM !
@SamBurke44 One more episode and you'll find it turns to a terrible nausea.
@Grimeandreason Oh that would be a GREAT question!
@deYook OH THERE YOU ARE. I’ve emailed, I’ve texted.......
@MusicAsArt I try to be nice to everyone!
@caroc54 Ooh it’s a good film though, isn’t it?
@jamesvogl I feel like that would kill something that I can’t quite put my finger on. Something to do with the authenticity of this massive live chat.
@Stephen_Jacobs I wasn’t, but I am now!
@RachelCarnac It’s a lovely one, isn’t it?
@Monsieur_Torres !! Perhaps you're thinking of Simon Spiro. They're all dreamy to me. But yes, @johnpayne92 is lovely in person too.
@boatracecarlo @SenseiChanning Ha thank you - although I've never done voiceover commercials. There must just be a lot of people who do them who sound like me.
@frustrated_slug I'm afraid I don't think I can do much about this, but I guess console yourself that it's such a BIZARRE story, at least you'll be able to tell it for years.....
@BPTC_Lecturer Oh I'm sorry to hear you didn't make it! I'm glad the auditions are fun, I always here they are. Better luck next time......
@myddelton Truth is, it's a great name. It sounds so ancient, like one of the Merry Men.
@srw647 Thank you!
@landladycheryl @RonJichardson @robbeckettcomic In my experience, of course, there is no other way to eat a sandwich on a train.
@rightsmartdan Is that true? @quizquizquiz ? It's an amazing fact if so.
@rawry_hatcher @frucool @davetv @RonJichardson @robbeckettcomic I'm very sorry to hear that. Not down to me - I didn't bring any guests!
@IDuckmanton @UniversityChal I can't criticise you for that.
@smiffy2701 Always.
Ah, ok, you got me, I forgot. But I’ve had a good run! I’ve tweeted Only Connect for THREE WEEKS, albeit last week with minutes to spare. So I was owed one. You didn’t miss much. Questions, questions.
@mihotep @JHolmesSheff I’m fine with all of it! Do what you like! I said in the piece you didn’t read: I’m not anti smoking or anti vaping. I just don’t think the NHS should pay for vapes. Ok you disagree; I’m fine with that too, you’re the one ranting at me. You’re not such a libertarian, I guess 🙄
@HotwaxAngie @Uberfailjimmy @cfcjohn49 @cfctaxi @tony4625 @scampo999 @rockne46 @westendtaxi @kimbarrett It wasn’t him! A foul-mouthed lookalike! He never drove such a car and he *never* swore at women!
@cfcjohn49 @cfctaxi @tony4625 @scampo999 @Uberfailjimmy @rockne46 @westendtaxi @kimbarrett I’VE LITERALLY NEVER BEEN IN AN UBER I’m sorry to hear they’re now operating again, I thought they lost their licence. Hmm.
@mihotep Ah, I see. You didn’t actually read the piece. So often the way! Enjoy the rest of the weekend.
@NigelBarrett6 @OnlyConnectQuiz !! She definitely knows. She was being kind...
@mihotep You seem nice.
@soozaphone @JamesEdmondston @SLSingh ! No I meant that spelling is common. Though I guess some people must think it’s the same person, in the same way my husband is often congratulated for Cloud Atlas.
@soozaphone @JamesEdmondston @SLSingh Don’t worry, it’s a very common mistake!
@allencarr I wish you very good luck blocking that out. I’m fairly resilient to most online shrieking, it bounces off me. But that’s not easily done, many are beaten into silence. Keep up the life-saving work!
@PlcFred No of course. I still yearn for them now, a few times a week. But it’s mental not physical.
@Wirralo @thehalfboy *Chances are* they’re less bad. But for me that’s - speaking purely analogously - like the state saying “Don’t hit your children, hit the cat!”. It’s not dealing with the main problem people have.
@52tartanrose @KrisSaunders24 My dad was usually doing both at the same time.
@PeteDeveson @soozaphone I mean... very well put. That’s exactly what I’m trying to talk about: who is motivated to encourage what, and why?
@sortmyspine The best of many nice things about this tweet is that, if you’d never sent it, I would never have seen the ‘scoliosis correction muffins’, which may be the greatest muffins I’ve ever seen.
@LindaBauld @JHolmesSheff That’s something I could definitely get behind.
@JamesEdmondston @soozaphone @SLSingh Yes, we need to be clear the much-loved comedian has made no claims to help with addiction!
@tricmak Thank you!
@mrlozmoore @KatrinaBruni @allencarr 🍾🍾🍾
@ThatJimmyAdams I agree, but it’s a dependence that’s very easily broken. It’s not like heroin. The physical ‘need’ is an irritating itch that’s gone in about two days. It’s the mental link that needs breaking.
@Jennife10651535 @sonnlich Well it really makes sense that it could be. Wherever there’s big money, there’s a risk.
@JonJHilton Also, risk or no risk, they just don't need it! As Allen Carr would say: you might as well stick the thing in your ear for all the pleasure it really gives you. Far more pleasure in going on holiday without being terrified of a no-smoking plane, a no-smoking hotel etc. Freedom!
@StarshipFight3r Ok - but you DON'T need a nicotine fix! I promise! You just think you do! Give your body two days without, and the need is gone. It's all mental, not physical, and you can think your way through it. You can!
@sonnlich Yes, some incredibly insightful people can suddenly see the logic on their own. For the rest of us, Allen Carr puts it so clearly and well.
@WesleyRiot People are always angry in the comments. I've long stopped looking!
@sparkysaintsean @allencarr I never ever ever thought I could stop. That was fine when I didn't WANT to stop, but really frightening when I did want to. For some people, it feels like the most incredible miracle.
@BellaJanella That's a very happy story. Well done.
In today's Observer: I think there are better uses for NHS funds than giving them to British American Tobacco.  https://t.co/P5cINqJvlA
@allencarr What a lovely thing to say. Obviously my own gratitude to Allen Carr is immense; this kind of piece is fuelled by anger when I think about how he was ignored by officialdom. I hope he knew that others would keep banging the drum on his behalf.
@joseppi97 There is a flow chart somewhere. I refuse to look at it a second time.
@Eryn_Turner7 Ha! No it’s very nice, thank you.
@mrschristine I look like Mr Spock, don’t I?
@mbywater @neilhimself Were you even friends with Terry Pratchett? I don’t even know why I think that, apart from maybe the hats and.. I don’t know.. it seems like you should have been friends.
@mbywater @neilhimself What? Is that ACTUALLY Bywater or a pretend one? What are you doing here? Why do I never see you? How long have you been on Twitter? What’s HAPPENING???? xx
@GoldmanEleanor Oh dear! I’m sorry!
@Muddyfudster Oh lord don’t ask me, I can barely work the toaster.
@CribbageNorwich @steve_lamacq @Lissimore @deYook @hornofplentypub I’m too rusty for competitive cribbage! One day...
@andrew_scobbie I’m always hearing bells
@stew_francis @SimonGr41594862 @onlyconnect Yes, with an anecdote like that it's a great shame not to have you on the show...
@badpenny1931 @Twinkle_too Well, now I'm a mother I figure I have to drink in secret.
@boringfileclerk Ah yes - I was tweeting about this at the time, but I think you're an episode behind... thanks very much, very glad you like it!
@vickybrown1980 She sounds great! I'm sorry for any saucy asides...
@DannyReeves11 Probably.
@ColonelBlimp @Baddiel The first one’s Jesse James, who robbed banks with his brother Frank. I’m leaving the Colonel copied in as he’ll be so tickled to know they’re friends of ours. Both Jews, of course, the Jameses.
@docshellington @cutpricethen @Baddiel Tell her THAT’S THE PATRIARCHY
@Baddiel Good question, isn’t it? Really hard to spot, then really neat.
@elismatthews I must be a witch
@Baddiel It’s a really nice hidden one...
@JJOBuse @OnlyConnectQuiz Nevertheless...
@gumbleinthewabe Ooh, you deserve that satisfaction.
@adelms8 Doctor!
@elismatthews I just assume it’s a match that’s constantly happening.
@Banjobetty3 @Baddiel Oh the Baddiel one is a VERY good one to get.
@jo23316074 That is its main downside.
@bolloxski I check my cards a lot.
@joepevans It’s been said before.
@kevintheobald I know, I know
Oh! I remembered! It’s now isn’t it? On BBC Two. Only Connect, starting now, I’m fairly sure.
@CribbageNorwich @deYook Unfortunately @deYook is abroad. We may have to play postally.
@Mustard655 I'm delighted to hear you're wearing a hat at all.
@markmccaughrean Sorry - I think that was the original tweet that had the wrong headline in! I had a second go. Thanks very much for being nice about the piece.
@itsaoibhinn I don't consider anything a serious sport.
@lizzyf101 You’ve Been Framed?!
@kemp_harper Ah but how long are they there doing that? Only until everyone’s figured out how it works!
@itsaoibhinn Thing is, I don’t have an opinion on pole dancing. I just think it would be funny to have it in the Olympics. But that wouldn’t add much to a documentary. Hope it goes well, good luck with it.
@garry_crew Lol
@AndyKinch1 That's good to hear. Happy recovery!
@StevieParle Well that certainly seems uncomplicatedly good.
@leehotmess @StevieParle BON APPETIT
@DatabaseSponge That's an excellent story. Merci.
@adrianbowyer Do they want to carve it in themselves, just to be on the safe side?
My Observer column today is attempting to be happy about robots! (Not that sort of robot... not that happy...)  https://t.co/ODsQgSECFO
@lenfinsbury NEVER RENAME A BOAT
@Talbie That is a very good idea for a show.
@tesswilloughby WE’LL BE THERE
@lydmizz @davidkirkland02 Oh yes. We sort the sheep from the goats, DON’T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
@ColletteR I’m very pleased to hear it.
@nlodge67 Oh yes
@jamesteggin Lol
@atkins_trevor @Vansbm That’s nice 🍾
AND I had a tweet from Anthony Costa about the intro. A memorable night! https://t.co/p2DHaMdCTv
@sidchristos No I know, I meant was the question about Petra or petros. Never mind, all ‘hydro’ under the bridge... (But I’m afraid I don’t have an autocue, it’s just me.)
@NettyH Lol
@leilapeekachoo No! They are uninventable.
@lydmizz @JimJamGin @OnlyConnectQuiz QUITE RIGHT!!
@dulcieSTBAM THAT’S NOTHING TO BE SAD ABOUT
@rockintheburbs I SHOULD THINK SO TOO. Congratulations.
@AntonyCosta @baabaa89 This is genuinely shaping up to be a good question.
@sidchristos Of course Greek. Did I say it wasn't ?? Petra or petros? I don't even remember the question and I just watched it.
@bbutterw2 WE LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU
@deaddawg64 @paul_critchlow Well, thank God there's one of you still out there.
@PugzuThesaurus When I'm on screen, there'll always be a few.
@TrueAnonyman They didn't need to! I knew anyway, but it's nice to see so many of them there.
@cezbongard I can't right now, thank you.
@paul_critchlow QUITE RIGHT
@nigelstreet It was a good response, wasn't it?
Yes, vice presidents, vice presidents. I didn't tweet because I thought, "Well, who will care?". But I'm pleasantly surprised to find so many... so many... let's just say so many LIKE MINDS in my timeline.
@MaraudingWinger Yes, yes, vice presidents. Quite right. I was going to tweet a minute ago, but then suddenly thought: will anyone notice anyway? So far it's just us...
@BudgenRupert What? What did I destroy?
@baabaa89 @AntonyCosta Of course he didn't!!
@BananeJen I'm afraid I don't even really know what those words mean. Isn't that a sort of small coat? I'm not wearing one!
Ok, well, they're not The Meeples, but for me the musical performances are all about BEING GAME. That's what I applaud.
I think I might watch this Only Connect (which is starting now). I remember it being a VERY TENSE FINISH.
What causes Frank to admit, "I've had more civil interactions"? What disappointed Oscar about best-selling novel The Island? Find out on Only Connect, tonight at 8pm! Some favourite quizzers are in excellent form.
@keiththecamel Have you read the thread? The tragedy is, this uncle sounds like a phenomenal guest. Just maybe not at a funeral.
@SenseiChanning @Kevish47 If that’s the kind of thing they talk about, I’m not playing the f***ing ME and that’s that
@DavidJBodycombe Lol
@graemeferguson7 Well at least you know where you left them.
@pfon73 They didn’t say a hundred lines, they said “a hundred lions”.
@valr0460 I DEFINITELY DIDN’T THROW MINE OUT
@sarahlovelyshop No, not really
@litllibrarian It's only a day to go!
@rodneylace TRIED THAT
@joycesutcliffe Terrible terrible. I hope you find it. If not, you know... it's your gift to the world.
@mobily_uk No, I was joking. The only way I'd win a point off Boris Becker is if something fell on him during the game.
My Observer column today is about Boris Becker and loss.  https://t.co/ktu5L623qa
@rhwilson83 What else is there to think about?
@MulberryCoates That’s my kind of 9 year old.
@Millinexec @rosieatlarge Ohhh I like it
@RufusHound ssssssssssssssss
Quickly think of a good name for a titled billionaire’s lover....  No, this is better. https://t.co/dFda1uIoHE
@badgerbod I’m not trying to suppress it at all! It’s not competitive against the other players though.. it’s more a determination to beat the tricksy letters/numbers.
@Dave_The_Daddy The boss? I’d throw it.
@idavo66 VERY SERIOUSLY
@GLawrieEDT Really? It should definitely be a word!
@BigBirdRuns Oh good, I hope you enjoy it!
@MrSnowgarden It was literally my pleasure.
@mrmarksteel You watch other quizzes??????
@Snizzbut @stephenfry @GBRJ_Official HE ALWAYS LOOKS MAGNIFICENT
@spruce_steven Lol
@deYook Have you resisted the temptation to google Jonathan Cheban? For me, he could still be anything from the heir to the Nepalese throne to a member of 5ive.
@deYook I like the desperation with which they call the COMPOUND famous.
@radioheadjen That must have been terrifying.
@jamesovegan @sanditoksvig Well that’s nice! Thank you very much
@SimonJBurrows85 I’m afraid your confidence is misplaced.
@Xsathrie @allsorts100 It’s good isn’t it?
@rickoshea @RTEGold But that’s perfectly in tune with OC. If I make a joke that only one person gets, which is true of many of my jokes, I call it a victory.
@CRiedlinger77 No that’s quite brilliant.
@beatstalk_uk Oh good! Happy travelling
@Philippa_Perry I mean, I *have* spent the afternoon trying to say it without sounding like Sean Connery, obviously...
@Philippa_Perry No! People think I’m joking! It’s a real programme!
@LangersD I admire how contrived that is. Good work.
I bet you can’t say “Game, Schett and Mats” without sounding like you’re doing an impression of Sean Connery.
@jondrytay Well imagine how Philippa Live-On-Eurosport must feel.
Did Eurosport hire Mats Wilander and Barbara Schett for tennis commentary SOLELY so they could call the programme “Game, Schett and Mats”?  If so, I strongly approve.
@puffedtweet No they do! It’s real!
@BusStationZebra I like the sound of her tremendously.
@kelly_shenton I like the sound of your house.
@noelmcgrath72 @hungoverdrawn @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo Yes, I heard “a hundred lions” and then worried later that WOULD count as a punishment, to the ancient Romans.
@ianblwalker @QuizQuizQuiz Sigh, you’re not the only one to say that. I think there was a printing error in a little batch of them. I believe Jack has made sure they know, and you can swap your book for a proper one....?
@teacupboats Haha, thank you very much
@akv2013 I don’t think it counts if the death was unconnected to the job.
@timames1 Sometimes four. Or five. It’s mood dependent.
@TORI_WINEDEVA That sounds like a lovely evening.
@RogerBoon1960 Yay!
@SharonLSlater @NextMrsClooney It is not.
@TimJones15 He is wonderful.
@kareng7630 I do love them all!
@AndrewzCooper @tomhbatty Well... I can be something of a contrarian...
@johnbond75babe @OnlyConnectQuiz Ahem. Have you seen the show before?
@exitthelemming I really was! xx
@dearg86 Aw thanks!
@conchwillow They said "a hundred lions" ! My concern watching it back is, could that have counted as a punishment in Roman days...?
@benedictwsmith Well nobody, obviously.
I just don't want either of these wonderful teams to go home.
@tommykl96 We look forward to it.
@AHappyHiveling She's just wonderful in every respect.
@domestic_tech RIGHTLY
@Puddle575 I love all six of them intensely.
@jon_brettell @suzywoozy13 Awwwwwwwwww
@newton_nj It certainly is.
OH COME ON! You just don't GET that on Mastermind!
@MelPetspalace ANY POINTS = A TRIUMPH
@andrew8912 Good work!
@Nick_LCFC_fan_1 It's an American film!
@RogerBoon1960 VICTORY LAP OF THE ROOM!
@SimonJHadley I wouldn't dream of it.
@ayeoot And it wasn't one of Silent Witness's funny bits? I'm so sorry.
@denisesouthard I'm sorry... I hate the clash...
@dominic_mcg Close. Good guess.
What job has a fatality rate of one in eleven? Find out on ONLY CONNECT, starting in ten minutes on BBC Two. #OohIRememberedItWasOn
@vickie72603201 I'm just looking now - I only see a fraction of my tweets, I'm afraid, I miss most of them. I'm very sorry to hear about your friend and certainly I wish him all luck and strength for a good recovery. And to his family.
@brightaliking Don't be ridiculous.
@findmethewords Oh, Black Beauty is HARROWING.
@PjrFoto Well I think it's always brilliant. But if you don't USUALLY like it, you might enjoy tonight's.
@Sofa_sound Surely you mean "MH" ... ;-)
Tonight's Only Connect (8pm on BBC2) is one of my favourite episodes of the series. Two wonderful teams, good questions and great singing. As in, PROPERLY great.
@findmethewords They're among the greatest children's books ever, aren't they?
@RobertLingard @MattHancock I think you've taken my tweet a bit seriously.
@CarpetFitterFr I was just trying to trick the British into being careful ;-)
@charlesarthur @MattHancock Oh I’m sure he knows. He’s quite knowledgeable about gambling, I think.
@RobertLingard @MattHancock Maybe it’ll go the other way and he’ll make a *draconian* move so people won’t think there’s underhandedness at Newmarket! £2 would be very severe.
@lizconlan ?!
@davidbower_ Yo ho ho
@overyourhead @OnlyConnectQuiz I shall draw my husband's attention to this remark.
@manlyartichokes I love Barry as well. We played poker together many years ago now.
@manlyartichokes Sure, of course, I saw Eddie Hearn a lot, I liked him. I think he's more involved with darts now.
@Flandyke Yes, that is.... It's very special.
@bingethinking What a pleasingly Dutch phrase.
@Nshallice @pestononsunday Tonic water? •bleurgh* I'm poisoned
In today's Observer: ambassadors or foreign news? Glasses or leopards? I'm playing an exciting new game! https://t.co/6EuuMVY17K
@pestononsunday TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING
@Harmaxia You would - if we had ANY PRIZES OF ANY KIND.
@john25389 My favourite is Shut Up And Deal by @ScurrilousMay - although that one is (I suspect quite lightly) fictionalised.
@DatabaseSponge But 4 of 7 #tepidcakes
@Kirstend100K I need hardly say, the thought of someone buying it for their dad means an awful lot to me.
@Morganised Well thank you for the support!!
@SenseiChanning Yes good luck finding one of those, never mind the book...
@AnnaMacbo Well, if she’s a fan of those things then even I can risk saying she might enjoy it...!
@ELawrenson86 I hope you have a video record of it.
@john25389 Well that’s very nice, thank you
@Viola_Bosun Once More With Feeling is, of course, a more challenging public read...
@cath__mack You could try harassing @QuizQuizQuiz ..
I didn't manage to include a link, of course. Look, here's one: https://t.co/4AVlWTatN8 - but it turns out there are only seven copies for sale anyway. Marvellous.
That's very nice. I'm going to re-tweet it, because seven years after publication sounds about right for me to manage a plug. Maybe it's one for Molly Bloom fans! https://t.co/d6lJp5lVHx
@JSN00K Yes, fair enough. But (joke in previous tweet aside) my point was that people particularly look different when they're pregnant so that's a weird picture to keep using.
@bj3656 @BBCRadio4 I hope you enjoy it!  https://t.co/4AVlWTatN8
Now, @BBCRadio4, it's very nice of you to promote this repeat but could you stop using that photo where I was 8 months pregnant?  (I was also three years younger. I now look thinner and much worse.) https://t.co/HIslxa14CT
@parsl You need the satnav I've got. Unerring ability to find the traffic jams.
@WendyGledall Lovely!
@nicolasimcock1 I'm just thinking about writing the first line now.
@housetoastonish Oh that’s good
@TARDIScabinets Perfect
@ditocap Yes but that doesn’t mean I can’t write a thriller.
@friendlydragon Meh, they’re not all that.
@ruth_lampard Oh yes of course. She definitely would be.
Just enjoying a box of “Waitrose Ultimate Chocolate Collection”. If I ever write a thriller, this is what the detective will be called. https://t.co/3S1dklU9pk
@boringfileclerk I haven’t had any!
@RichardHilburn Is grain a unit of weight? I thought that was mass?
@Fankle I'm afraid it won't make sense whatever order you watch it in.
@citydoc56 If you ever get anything you should be proud of yourself. I rarely do, and I've already read all the questions in advance.
@maryameliarobbo What? That’s a SNOOKER joke. It doesn’t work for either of them!
@newton_nj Lol
@GetItQuietly The winners can laugh
No, but escapologists don't try to avoid getting CAUGHT, they try to avoid getting TRAPPED. So it only works one way. https://t.co/dcBKMlKprD
Oh come on, this one is quality material. https://t.co/xsnCdFdZow
@DaveCurran99 I was reminded by one of the Cricketers...
Is this a 'Howzat' pun? I really like it but I'm worried I'm not getting it properly. https://t.co/39f4y1mefH
I don't know anything about cricket but I BET that's better. https://t.co/R2VNVYaUna
Only Connect is on tonight! At 8 o'clock on BBC Two, the Escapologists will try to wriggle past the Cricketers' stumps. (Does that work? It sort of works.)
@NeilClarke1975 @OnlyConnectQuiz Ooh good reminder. I HAD forgotten. I'll tweet it now.
@pedg You're right! I'm so familiar with it ("taking a rake", or percentage of the pot, is what makes a game illegal when it's not on licensed premises - as opposed to friends playing at home and nobody profiting from running it) that it never occurred to me, but that wasn't explained.
@guyacampbell @dvarets ;-)
@chazzer Yes, fair enough, maybe a bit of time is meant to have passed. And we're just skipping to the important bit...!
In today's Observer: I loved Molly's Game, but... bang, thud, ow, zzzzz. https://t.co/fIHxRr7h5J
@AFrenchAuthor Thanks very much! You too.
@ThatLiamAnthony @philiplickley Lol
@tomrigby @Les_Dubh @OnlyConnectQuiz @bbc2 !! I love that theory
@JJOBuse Yes, I can’t help liking that
@Les_Dubh @OnlyConnectQuiz @bbc2 Yup, it’s gone back to Monday nights.
@DCampbellGodwin It moved back to Mondays...
@rob_homer @LeeMack I was on it once, about seven years ago. MAYBE I WAS JUST TOO GOOD AT IT. #pokerface
@PolygoniaSpec @OnlyConnectQuiz No doubt I'll forget again.
@DragonbubZee Ha! That’s very flattering.
@MGlobey That sounds like a Monday game to me.
@LostCertainties It’s almost compulsory
@RachelCarnac I'm not sure.
@Chrisrich25 It’s great how many people watched the 1967 race on YouTube after the programme..
@Steve_Parrett Ha! Thank you
@CRiedlinger77 Yes, that sounds petrifying.
@NickTreby I’m very glad you did! I’m interested in that sort of thing. Awesome, eh? NOTED.
@deYook @CribbageNorwich Magnificent
@RealPickle1 It’s like looking in a mirror.
@NickTreby 8pm?! That’s a late Brownies.
Only Connect is on TV tonight, on its usual (and therefore unusual) day - but at an unusual, therefore usual, therefore unusual time: 8pm, BBC Two!
@DoctorT1992 @MrPaulRobinson NONE TAKEN.
@fifiglover I'm in! As long as I don't have to tell any anecdotes. I'm terrible at anecdotes.
@DGH_V3 Everybody in the world has a hinterland.
@CribbageNorwich It depends on the availability of my long-term cribponent @deYook. If he’s around, I definitely will.
@VickiHeadPhoto @NTGunbyHall They’re great!
@loopygoose Oh, well, I’d guess that means there’s a different word for it in a different card game?
@loopygoose Do you mean a Grand Slam? That would be the name for winning all the tricks in a hand of bridge.
@mikeyohara85 Happy new year!
@CribbageNorwich If you remind me that week I’ll definitely tweet it!
@VickiHeadPhoto She’s great too. Post the other ones!
@VickiHeadPhoto Oh that’s a great Professor Plum.
@PeteBlow They do that as soon as I walk in.
@jimineuropa @JP2796 @RealDMitchell Ooh, that rings my bell.
@JP2796 Happy new year...
@davhop72 Yes, it was very familiar territory to me. I might try and write something about it this week.
@Chris_Downs_ Yes. Luck will always be one of the factors. But in a good slow tournament it can be overcome a lot of the time.
@wildigital @homomofo I remember that feeling. Do it.
@timcarppy I did once! A long time ago.
@bobbyllew @elonmusk I think @what3words is a beautiful and brilliant idea. As you’d expect from @jackwc
@lydmizz @FrankMPaul So many comments I couldn’t make... so many...
@JacquiGeddes2 @rickygervais @JasonManford @elonmusk @antanddec I mean, you’ve gone for the obvious five there. I feel I can pinpoint Ian’s taste very precisely. Happy birthday! 🎈🎈🎈
@tanjastweets If I ever make these, that’ll be the only size I do them in.
@gilliansix @OnlyConnectQuiz @YorkshireLawMan Happy new year!
@QuizQuizQuiz @mungohenning @Graftern @OnlyConnectQuiz But we might have taken [eg] 14 as well, if you gave that quick, clear rationale. I’ll sometimes accept alternative answers if I like them!
@Graftern @OnlyConnectQuiz Ooh, nice alternative sequence @QuizQuizQuiz
@Oc7ober Don't worry, that wasn't an answer...
@charlietabloid I'm sorry, you're quite right, it was the first round. I NEVER WANT ANYBODY TO GO HOME.
@JeffNBrown Ha! They'll find team mates for you. But I think the cut-off for 2018 series was just before Christmas, so you might not be able to audition till next year...
I think I'd better close the internet. Thank you if you joined us for our return to the start of the week, happy New Year, #HappyMondays.
@Tweety_DaveIII Well, quite.
Bruce Dickinson! Don't get me wrong, I think Only Connect is the best quiz of all time, but they have BRUCE DICKINSON. That's pretty impressive.
Meanwhile, no spoilers, but I'm very sorry to say goodbye to that team and its excellent captain. The competition has reached the stage where I really hate to lose anyone.
ooh, the continuity announcer just said it would be 8.30 next week! I'm very pleased.
Chemical elements and US states with the same abbreviation! I mean, HAPPY NEW YEAR.
@6_tailed_comet It was! Good Coren triv. (Not that I used that name when I submitted it.)
@JeffNBrown We accept single applications! Have done for a couple of series now. And then we matchmake...
@dplaister Not after the first half hour.
@evilniamh *clinks glasses*
@Johntum64 I feel like a proud parent! OR GRANDPARENT.
@super_matt2 Go you indeed. How have you JUST missed the cut-off to apply for the new series?
(I don't often watch it, but I'm celebrating the return to Mondays. Aren't these people brilliant? THEY ARE BRILLIANT.)
I may be a couple of glasses down, but I do LOVE the people who come to play Only Connect. They're so funny and clever.
@limeandyoda @OnlyConnectQuiz 🍾🍾🍾
@tiffanyjbudd Well, he's in the majority there. Happy new year!
@Gruffsdad They have said it is! Hurray!
@ourChloePup @CloonfourMegan @mrsdog @alfnme TOO LATE
@LucyLucifer82 Well that's nice! I think! Happy New Year.
Please note: in a break from tradition, Only Connect is at 8pm, with University Challenge on *afterwards*. https://t.co/pQgVIfqjXr
In 20 minutes' time on BBC Two: a clue about a car inspires a quizzer to reveal he has no sense of purpose. Yes, it's a happy new year with Only Connect.
@christinesavil1 I’m not sure, by “we”, you’re including the show itself? (A Welsh show, of course). Certainly we hope it’ll be shown everywhere at once...!
@lewisismyname1 No! Of course not!
Only Connect returns to Mondays tonight, at the surprising time of 8pm on BBC Two! It's on BEFORE University Challenge!  My eye will be twitching for a fortnight.
@anothergirl157 Thank you very much! But... Emancipation? Is he locked in the cellar?
@EmBoulton Well capitalised!
@CH0L0K Oh but you can.
@AlexJCall Ah, well now, that is not quite so straightforward ...
No Only Connect tonight - we’re moving back to Mondays, starting on New Year’s Day 🍾
@Bobbie_Print @BBC No no, it’s good news! We’re moving back to Mondays, starting on Monday!
@neiloboy @NicolaMostyn ! If I had one, I’m sure I would.
@NicolaMostyn That’s lovely to hear! Thank you
@loopygoose The comma really bears a little burden in that tweet, doesn’t it? Like an ant.
@theJeremyVine @rickedwards1 @jakdeschner @ObsNewReview @Nick_Hewer @susie_dent @QuizMistress That’s nice! We should all go out for lunch - except, if the waiter asked “Are there any questions?”, the answer might trigger a breakdown.
@alice11638 Ah, that takes me right back to 2009.
@OhNoItsSara 🎅🎅🎅
@rickedwards1 @jakdeschner @ObsNewReview @Nick_Hewer @susie_dent @theJeremyVine @QuizMistress Well *I* enjoyed your interview enormously! Merry Christmas! 🎄🎄🎄
@EmmaAmmenna Yes; I had considered marrying him, but my name would have just been too ridiculous.
@Kenflaw @moogal Only thing is, often the latter gets in the way of the former.
@sampie_pants @Andy_Brock1986 That is literally better than anything that’s ever been won on the actual show.
@rta_scales That’s a LVLY nscrptn! What nice parents. I’m really touched to see that, thank you. Merry Christmas.
@AMWizzo @OnlyConnectQuiz What? Really? Are you sure it doesn’t just FEEL REPETITIVE? I haven’t heard of that elsewhere - sorry - hope you can change it soon.
@BakerThompsonAL Happy Christmas!
@kirstypalf26 @OnlyConnectQuiz 🎄🎄🎄
@clare_molyneaux @Nigella_Lawson @SarahMillican75 What a merry trio
@political_moo @ObsNewReview @Nick_Hewer @rickedwards1 @susie_dent @theJeremyVine @QuizMistress My dad was very good like that. I’m sorry to hear that sad news about your mum. Best wishes for Christmas.
@Martin1966 That’s a lovely message. Thank you for sending it on. It really was my pleasure, absolutely no trouble at all. Warmest wishes to you all.
@Martin1966 @alfiemoore @RealDMitchell Very best wishes to all of you, and merry Christmas.
@SianAitken Well done that detective.
@cfcblairzo Of course! What could we do? It was the given answer. https://t.co/KpYIk9UsJM
@thomaswilliams @SimonKoppel EVEN MORE ADMIRABLE. I’ll be grateful for ever!
@twriley1 Impossible. I’d never get her out of it.
@MamieSylviaG You too!
@Trumpetmike Ah, that does remind me of my single days.
@DonaldOgg2 That’s very kind. Sadly, it doesn’t end there.
@thomaswilliams Ha! Merry Christmas.
@susie_dent Thank you for your lovely comments about Only Connect in the paper today! I wish you a blithesome, Saturnalian Christmas.
@BeccaMeriel Thank you! Happy Christmas! May your stockings be stuffed with nuts.
It's worth reading it in order, to appreciate quite how significantly I misjudged the tone. Everyone else answered properly. Especially the one about giving and receiving. Oh dear. https://t.co/oPi5NFG45n
Merry Christmas! I haven't written a column in the Observer this week, but I did take part in this festive GRILLING OF THE QUIZ SHOW HOSTS.  https://t.co/FuowoIRIPt
@Hazel_Ann77 @richardosman I’M DELIGHTED YOU SHARED THIS WITH RICHARD OSMAN
@JocelineBury I love the singing.
@RazorPP Oh that’s nice! We’re only on series 13 though. UNLUCKY FOR SOME. (Especially those who hoped it would be cancelled after two).
@johnlbirch @OnlyConnectQuiz I like the sound of those children.
@speedmaster100 I think it’s going to be the other way round. But maybe only for one week. Or it might be a misprint in the Radio Times #unheardof
@mrsnodes Took the words right out of my mouth.
@SamanthaCropper I’m afraid not. Maybe next year.
@MrsCourtyard Yum yum
@WilkieTong I’m afraid to tell you they might be on in the wrong order. I don’t know why. I’m hoping it’s just for New Year.
@SenseiChanning Ummmmmmm.... April?
@suequinn46 I wish I could say the same about mine.
@lyndamac_62 Well done that man!
Starting on BBC2: the last Only Connect on a Friday! After this, it’s back to Mondays (starting New Year’s Day). That’s why I’ve remembered.
@tanja__eder @PugzuThesaurus That's revealed in most Only Connect episodes as well, to be honest.
@Stephenjdonohoe No, it would be inappropriate at this happy and loving time of year.
@LrdBlackAdder My baubles are always on display.
@DoinItAllWrong Don't worry, I've just remembered the show is on Fridays, in time for us to NEVER BE ON FRIDAYS AGAIN. We move back in January.
@Mickrick @ALifeOnAChain @OnlyConnectQuiz The bell's gone, so we only hear a buzzer. It's perfectly logical.
@Fankle Never.
On tonight's Only Connect, a contestant reveals a witch in the family and there's a really *lovely* music sequence. I promise! 8.30pm, BBC Two.
@brightaliking Happy birthday!
@AWordNerdWrites Happy birthday! 🎈🎈🎈
@jasonwestall @grosvenorcasino Come on the over 35s! Lol
@leftybearcub Merry Christmas!
@Super_Cilium @Kathbum @SarahMillican75 That sounds like an excellent show.
@thatsmithwoman Well, thank you. It made me very sad to read it back.
@abbeysuekos NICE SEAL
@alan_mackie That’s between me and my conscience.
@SKiiZZ Hurray!
@Pipistrelle_xyz That’s very nice of you! Thank you very much, merry Christmas.
In today's Observer, I've got all your Christmas gift problems sorted. https://t.co/0fdlWLLwzc
@MoolchanN No
Oh Debbie McGee is pretty amazing, isn’t she?
@steve66myers All three. Am I too late?
@LizHannah25 Sent?
Well, I know what MY answer to that question would be. https://t.co/YnIcHiMMBE
@Hedgeees I’m the wrong person to ask. I will NEVER understand it. I can’t tell the time at all. @QuizQuizQuiz
An extra hidden connection is unveiled in tonight’s Only Connect! Those who have paid close attention will be rewarded, at 8.30pm on BBC2...
@puppywalker1 Happy birthmas!
@skepticosaurus Oh! I thought you'd made that picture. That's the one I did? Wow. [It'll be  "great grandma" next time.)
@skepticosaurus You must be approximately 368 years younger than I am.
@CorinnaHarrod She sounds like my kind of girl. Apart from the pushing the food around.
@jackcullenuk That made me very happy.
@mrgb63 Lol. It might be, but we've never had so much as a free bread roll there. I'm happy to pay! I just like it!
@revolve456 I can only hope, for your sake, that it's not for yourself.
@DarrellRivers That's beautifully put.
@NiclasNp It's hard to put my finger on it exactly. Temperature, atmosphere, colour scheme, number of hot pies?
@cathpearce Is there any other kind?
@cinglisboyd That is excellent etymology. I hope it's true!
@alan_mackie Well I do that before every episode anyway.
(That would be funnier if I could make a picture of the actual page come up under the words, like it does when posting an Observer column, but I can't make that happen. I'm giving up. I feel 400 years old.)
Stuck for gift ideas? Why not ruin a loved one's festive season with THIS demoralising experience? Merry Christmas! https://t.co/01T7N1giRJ
@fatboyliving Happy birthday!
@clarkeky Oh HELLO.
@KMackie248 After a few.
@ianrgalloway You haven’t met my friends.
@chauffeur20021 A giant Christmas pudding costume. ALLURING....?
@kiely85 Oh you’ll have a GREAT time.
@jayrayner1 I DISAGREE WITH IT
@leftybearcub IT’S LIKE A MIRROR.
@Dunkcanio Unusually, not necessary.
@Gillyfizzy We think quite differently about food.
@marcrisby Oh yes.
@jayrayner1 There may be literally no point in having any other restaurants at all.
@MMaureen01 Sshhhh
@Fankle Yes.
@madebyjake Yes! We went there in the summer. That was lovely too.
@Ryanpshill No, the margaritas.
@PhilHurst911 Come over here and say that.
@iAmeriCaRR Well quite. MERRY. CHRISTMAS.
@jane_kjane It’s in Maiden Lane in London. It’s so TWINKLY. It’s like eating inside a Christmas tree.
I think Rules in Covent Garden might be the nicest and Christmassiest restaurant in the world, and if you say it isn’t I’ll fight you.
@pietrosperoni Ha! Yes, that would be me and @deYook, but I'm afraid not. We couldn't do that.
@gilescoren @Nicklezard @mirauer Just for clarity: I think my brother is saying we both co wrote all of it! Not...
@JacobOrin I can’t tell you you’re wrong. It’s certainly a “typo” that many, many, many people have made.
@tinytiptoes I hope your wishes come true!
@wagonmastergene @OnlyConnectQuiz May tomorrow go better for you!
@Jrharve @1StevieKilner It's "seedless easy peelers"......... Merry Christmas...
@SpainInTheArse lol
@Zeus84uk That’s a nice message! Thank you.
@ErinTheWorld I think that’s a very common feeling...
@LadySakai I've got one but can't really manage to make it work.
@Charliecondou You too! I'm literally having margaritas for breakfast.
@lucyjoannah "braver" is one word for it.
@bobdebilde It's whether and how much to say the "l" that troubles me.
@martinusher77 That's nice, thank you!
@Kitty4006 No, it's the Observer but that newspaper's articles are put up on the Guardian website. They should probably put "Observer" on those pages as well, it would be a bit clearer!
@jjohndrobertson Thank you! Your kind words carry weight!
@rhepstein1 @sarahchurchwell He's quite the snazzy fellow.
In today's Observer, I'm an idiot.  Not for the first time.  But today I'm admitting it.  https://t.co/vmUOEcJQ22
The spelling error is down! That was a bit of fun on a snowy morning. So, let's start again...
@brightaliking It's fine it's fine, my boss at the paper just called and apologised - they didn't need to, it happens, I'm just laughing at the irony!
@ajohnduncan Because I managed to delete it by accident. Idiot.
@KevGeo2011 Wrongly.
@lisaom28 @guardian Bloody hell. If so, it's you and me both... Thanks for pointing it out! Problem with the particular mistake is, I wish I could be 100% sure it's nothing but a simple typing error.
My name's Coren. Not Cohen, Coren.  I've been writing for the Observer (now published on the Guardian website) for EIGHTEEN YEARS.  My actual column this week is about celebrating the incompetence of our professional colleagues. I think the universe is testing my sense of irony. https://t.co/dKeuT4Xj0t
Congratulations on making your century, my favourite gambling twins @SenseiChanning and @joebeevers  xxx
@mattom2cv I mean, it isn’t.
@grassangel It’s a great game.
@joirving Ooh that DOES sound like a good evening.
@mistymoo23 Everyone’s a critic.
@STOFMGS They’re all special.
@AngelWil1980 FW: Interested in applying for the next series of Only Connect? The CLOSING DATE is ONE WEEK AWAY!!! Email onlyconnect@parasolmedia.co.uk...
@KamphuisHA The answer to that is somewhere in the mists of time.
@takklondon My hands are tied, my lips are sealed, I feel your pain!
@Littlun007 I dance to the music in my head.
@jdjtahi @OnlyConnectQuiz I think you need to email the address on the form to get that - good luck!
@braces1953 Well the BBC have promised us that, I can only pass that on!
@jwaterworth Ahhh... that’s one for the MOST DEVOTED viewers.. you’d have to have a perfect memory and to have never missed an episode..
We’re on tonight aren’t we? It’s halfway through isn’t it? But it’s not my fault this time! We’ve been off so often I forgot! Sorry!
@man5city Sure. But if your confidence is well placed, you might not get on.
@Welsh_Lion @OnlyConnectQuiz Oh I assume it would be a bit longer than that.. good luck!
@Wirral_Retiree There may be no better way to spend time.
@benmrowe They say they are...............
@pietrosperoni Ah, too late I’m afraid. It hasn’t been on sale for a few years now.
@radioheadjen Oh, I would think so
@woohookitty ! I think we’re on a break from snooker...
@Trifleking There are always a few. You can definitely apply solo!
@paulaw32 You can enter by yourself! Check the small print: if you get in, they’ll find you a team!
I mean, come on, what’s the best adventure you’ve got planned for next year so far?  Really, just that? Again? Mix it up a little.. https://t.co/oz0SL0wiyb
@polkadotfun @OnlyConnectQuiz That already looks more high-tech than we are.
@shajedakhanom @OnlyConnectQuiz So do I
@wodman2000 @OnlyConnectQuiz Friday!
@chriscarter1969 @OnlyConnectQuiz I don’t think so, I’m afraid. But the adults can apply and they’ll find you a team mate?
@Samiieface @OnlyConnectQuiz I’M SURE WE CAN SORT SOMETHING OUT
@volvogirl974 What do you mean? It is a thing! I saw it in a shop!
@Beegrrrl That was NOT a waste of time. Collecting things is brilliant.
Well, who wouldn’t want that? https://t.co/FOLngyd4Xg
@Stevec4117 A seasoned something.
On BBC2 at 8.30pm: things get muddy as The Wiganites take on the ferocious ingenuity of The Fylders. But Only Connect returns next week.
@mocy1983 @Sabrina45X @MartiniComedian @OnlyConnectQuiz I like that one. It’s sort of almost a group.
@MacrolensMn I think it’s back next week. Next Friday.. I think..
@Fritsey @MartiniComedian @OnlyConnectQuiz Well, I’ve never had it myself
@Aurelius I did not. I’m delighted to hear it.
@Pipistrelle_xyz That’s nice! I can’t think of a more desirable review.
That’s right! If YOU’d like to feel bad about yourself this Christmas, the Only Connect book is available in all good bookshops. https://t.co/5Lwp6fUTE5
@lionjethro Bad news, I’m afraid I only remember that quite vaguely myself. It was to do with one of the questions... I forget... sorry
@Jomkelly @_celizabethh @BBCTwo Happy birthday!
@radioheadjen @GabrielaDow Oh WELL avoided.
@SirRyanR Yes, that is PRECISELY in keeping. There may be no more erotic words than “gently smoking wok”.
@elwookster I didn’t. What a pleasing addendum.
@GabrielaDow I was thinking about that horrible film just today. I’m very glad that piece is still findable, thank you! We’re not alone!
@mocy1983 @geofftech @norwegiancheese @garybrannan That’s nice! Thanks very much.
@bermuda_onion @Pablito999 No! It’s spelt scone and pronounced scone!
@ell_jay_bee I think it was off because of the football...
@Pablito999 Nonsense. It’s pronounced “scone”.
@AngelKneale Yes I’m sure. @onlyconnectquiz would confirm, but if single people can enter then why not duos?
@doogleQ I admit, when I saw the page this morning it felt like a glimpse into a parallel universe.
@ruthie147 That’s a nice thing to say
@pauledwarddenne One for each contestant.
@neilhimself @terryandrob I’ll definitely get that. Thanks so much - it’s just been the 10th anniversary since he died, I’ve enjoyed this exchange a lot.
@neilhimself Really? I wish my dad was here to know that! I don’t know if they knew each other but it feels like they must have met.
@BunkanMerguson @iamxadoc @JazzyJon You’ll find all those in my dressing room.
@christianjbdev Thank you!
@iamxadoc @BunkanMerguson @JazzyJon Well, I mean, if they’re REALLY impressive, we wouldn’t even know.
@DrippyHippy Bloody hell! That’s like something from a horror film. Whoever’s head is on there.
@jamesvogl Hahaha no it’s NOT like that. Different sort of fondness! I love it that you remain haunted by that.
@N23434 Well if I met you at a party I’d be really pleased. I think you sound brilliant.
@N23434 The real challenge is sneaking a look at it without anyone noticing.
@Myfullsuitcase Ha! Sorry...
@volvogirl974 Thank you! Though I genuinely believe that certain complaints are also a compliment anyway.
@thesauceagain Ooh you’re right. I think I can get away with using the phrase figuratively, though?
@srw647 I mean, he looks right up my street there.
In today's Observer: the news reminds me of an old affection for Michael Gove... https://t.co/cWoyQOXlwD
@neilhimself Hurray! (But imagine how I feel...)  You know they shared a great mutual friend in Michael Bywater. Perhaps he inspired them both?
@neilhimself Oh that's very lovely to hear! There's not much nicer you could have said, really. Thank you so much.
@minglish8 @jessibow Meh, we can find you one
@Aurelius Well that’s a team I’m looking forward to.
@chairleg1980 🍾🍾🍾
@Vamp_Blackrose @Braincapers @iantunnacliffe @neilhimself Sorry about that - I can’t remember, but it might have been cut in the edit if the show ran long, because it isn’t part of the connection..
@lozdoz1 @OnlyConnectQuiz Ha! We should go for a drink.
@HamHayley HAND IT IN
@gilescoren Well, of course he does!
@ntwamley @RightSaidDredd @Bruno_Di_Gradi In Ireland, you say........ so near and yet so far...
Some of you are asking whether tonight's Only Connect is the Children In Need special. No! We didn't make one of those this year, and we didn't know we were going to be on a Friday! So.. um.. sorry, CiN.. Anyone who watches our show PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER MAKING A DONATION!
@RightSaidDredd @Bruno_Di_Gradi @ntwamley @ChrisFrean Well that's just ridiculous.
@mcintoshpaul Oh, you don't know our question setters. That would NEVER be the answer.
@Philipcarman Good luck!
@weaselpopper Define "is"............
@RightSaidDredd @Bruno_Di_Gradi @ntwamley Do you all live in Ireland? If not, YOU'RE OUR KIND OF THREESOME. I think you have to be UK based though. Hope to see you next year......... https://t.co/RyUo8WrUv2
@FrizFrizzle Saucy.
And if you wouldn't be surprised because you just know that sort of thing, why not come along and play on the next series??????  Solo quizzers or teams of two and three, apply as follows: https://t.co/z9nDd3As7M
WHICH CONTINENT CONTAINS THE MOST COUNTRIES? You might be surprised.. we'll discuss it at some length on Only Connect, 8.30 tonight on BBC Two.
@clare1608 Of course she was! @QuizQuizQuiz
Ooh, a book of poker-themed short stories! How wintry and tempting. Very much looking forward to reading them, especially @barnyboatman’s. https://t.co/cX5BqccM59
@jondrytay @thejimsmith @simonblackwell I don't trust myself to type an answer...
@99jangles Not "a few fireworks in the garden with the kids". A *fireworks party*. Dozens of people, huge garden, extended semi-professional display. If that's a nurse who's just knocked off after a 72-hour shift I'll give you £100.
@buddhabder It's good to keep the rage alive.
@nimmyou Lol
@MathsWithoutMis “Nah, I prefer the extra words” ? 🤗
@grahamjohnson1 Yes. I had a Cadbury’s mini-chocolate fruit machine as a child and look how I turned out.
@sisteredna1 ...as usual.
@HolliePocket20 @RealDMitchell @ArtHouse43 @JazzyJaney Please.. Michelle Pfeiffer and that guy out of The Colbys? What more do you want from an ill-advised remake?
@RFFH I’m glad you quote-tweeted. You’re as annoyed by jokes about JC as the other guy was by the lack of them! So the show got the balance right.
@jlup1980 @YoungBrokePhil Well, it was funnier. Can’t be all doom and gloom.
@hants_bluepants Ha! Hopefully they’ll ask me again next series.
But I’m watching The Boy With The Topknot on BBC Two. @Sathnam this is great. Trying to work out who’s who in the Times office ;-)
@Ian42Kay YES, you’re 100% right. 130% right.
I don't like being able to fit that much information into a Tweet. I used to like the challenge of the editing process. A tiny art form dies.
The extended Have I Got News For You is on BBC1 tonight at 10.45 with Ian &amp; Paul, me, Sara Pascoe, Henry Blofeld and a lot of excellent puns. (As if there were any other kind.)
@megs_smithy That's really lovely to hear, thank you!
@RealDMitchell Let’s start by having one in every room.
@Daniel190597 Water.....?
@GeoDunn81 TOO LATE
@Alb_Ee They really don’t! The computer connects each hieroglyph to a specific question.
@drnjshelton @BBCOne Sorry to butt in but there were no jokes about Eric Pickles or “fatness” on HIGNFY last night.
@Karen_L_Hughes I didn’t know her, but was terribly sad to read about it.
@ChellieBot Very good. If you buzzed in before clue 4, I’d give it to you.
@mmaabel It’s not our value system!! We have done some charity episodes with brilliant writers and broadcasters, but it’s been a while.
@nataliejbeaty @dollyalderton @jimsyjampots There is literally no such thing as a 7-year-old that isn’t beautiful.
@_davidtaylor_ I think you might have read a piece I wrote a year ago and thought it was recent? My last newspaper article was about the police.
@cjmcgoo @_NatashaDevon Aww that's even nicer xx. I've subsequently learned that (especially in the place we were) most teenagers are too busy drowning in their own confidence crises to notice anyone else's...
@DaveChallender @mrmarksteel Hasn't everything?
@AliCatterall Well, I saw it. And I enjoyed it enormously. You can't imagine how much. Happy reading.
@RobertDick I bet it's BRILLIANT.
@SmoneyCarbs @nospaceformilk ...but enough about your social life 😎
@KieranRawley That’s true. Oil painters being mischievous, @QuizQuizQuiz ?
@_NatashaDevon That’s a nice thing to see on a Saturday morning! Thanks very much.
@Fankle I always keep a spare underneath, like Superman.
@BrendanMcW @blowersh Thank you but no credit here, he’s always wonderful!
@dean197 Thank you very much
@nospaceformilk You’ve got quite the Saturday afternoon ahead.
@DavePressland @Oneshowywoman YES I WOULD
@mariamcerlane A STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION. x
@MacklinTony I didn't think so, but now I see the pictures...
@elise_emmerson It's a heartbreaking story. I do hope that justice is restored and she comes home.
@Oh_My_Croft Ooh so it is.
@MrShaneReaction LOVELY.
@Chrisfs59 It looks so different in the studio.
@DiogenesHeir @haveigotnews @paulcocks96 you two should talk...!
@paulcocks96 @haveigotnews @sarapascoe @blowersh @BBCOne I don't know what you mean. I had LOADS of jokes at his expense! His historical knowledge.. his defence strategy.. public spending.. watch it again!
@hitmanharman Damn. You're right.
@Somewhataldente @shaunwkeaveny @blowersh He is, isn't he?
@Nigella_Lawson xxx how dare he knock your egg technique. Sparta indeed!
@das_spacepope Paul made that point at the recording. But I don't see why the two are mutually exclusive!
@Louli04 I'M GLAD SOMEONE DID.
@Jomo1966 @OnlyConnectQuiz @BBCTwo Nonsense. You just need more sleep.
@mrmarksteel I can actually hear you laughing at the explanation of the Enid Blyton question.
@Caulfield501 @sarapascoe @blowersh Imagine being married to me.
@Johnphi91540519 BORROW THE LAWNMOWER AND NEVER GIVE IT BACK.
@MoolchanN IT IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD SIGN.
Guests on tonight's HIGNFY are @sarapascoe and @blowersh - both wonderful, in such incredibly different ways.
@PhiSmal Yes, I'm sorry about that. But I do love a tall man ;-)
@matthew_maddock Yes, but I think tonight if you have BBC 2 HD.
@fireballman Just about.
And if you JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH of my croaky voice and special orange TV face, I'm also hosting @haveigotnews straight after that, 9pm on BBC One.
There are married couples and siblings on Only Connect tonight. Let battle commence at 8.30 on BBC Two! (or, in some areas, BBC2 HD).
@GeoffBraterman @Joannechocolat No no, I'm not having a pop, I wrote that a year ago. It is my deeply-felt view, but it isn't a response!!!
@MacFloozy @JennyFlintoft So am I. Good luck with that excellent adventure!
@isabenfica51 I'm so very sorry to hear it. I expect you're a brave and brilliant and beautiful person; perhaps she knew that in her heart, but no doubt had her own problems. Warmest wishes.
@SenseiChanning lol
@rhiannonev @katbrown That's very nice of you both! I think I might pop out for tea and buns. ;-)
@Bigg_les1 I’d love to do that!!
@VCM36 Ha, you too
@JKuechel Very vaguely.. I think I know the one you mean. I like weird TV.
@RedLlwynog Yes, usually the night before.
@themounts No they’re absolutely great. If you’re hosting, there’s a v funny script but you can play with it as much as you want. Best of both worlds.
@alfaulk You’re not wrong
@letthewolfin That’s very nice, thank you!
@newton_nj Yes  I let nothing interfere with my typing  Also predictive text helps
@CRiedlinger77 a) you will look beautiful  B) this however is a problem
@MarkMurphy66 I think perhaps only on Saturday? So nuts. Wales is the most important place frankly.
@escapehere Me too
Then again, it’s a good week to watch HIGNFY. So much news! If I wasn’t on it, I’d definitely watch. I’ll be quiet now.
Also, confusingly, I’m hosting HIGNFY tomorrow, but you might want to space them out a bit or, you know, SHH NOW VCM enough already
Only Connect is on tomorrow night! I’ve remembered early while slightly tipsy, but I usually don’t remember at all so I thought I’d mention.
@ABaillie64 But you’d be alone, that’s the problem
@LLKShep What a lovely thing to say, thAnk you
@CharlieRivers @PumfreyRichard Not if you put in several chips, double or more of the previous bet. That’s a raise.
@CharlieRivers It’s a game that’s very easily - if not BEST - played in total silence! Let the chips do the talking.
@Ian_Hislam Friday...
@bluesman74 But Christmas/Boxing Day isn’t a loud public activity affecting the entire neighbourhood. Not til the rows kick off, anyway.
@Ian_Hislam I did worry about that. But I was HET UP!!!
@glosnow Ohhhhhhh poor little creature. I wish you a peaceful 7th November.
@janettice If you worked every night the week before, and all weekend, then you missed it. Unlucky.
@philrange @CovertPseudonym Lol
@Welshnain It would take them too long to answer. It changes every week. From January it should be simpler...
@mocy1983 I MEAN QUITE.
Okay, I mean, if November 5th is a Thursday, whatever, people do it at the weekend. But MONDAY NOVEMBER 6th? That's taking the absolute grrr
What kind of wankers have a fireworks party on MONDAY NOVEMBER 6TH? I coped with a nervous sleepless toddler LAST night, but....?? WTF?
@alfiemoore @Humberbeat Yes so they said in the paper, Humberside Police
@Stueybig35 Happy retirement!
@SalBWMP @guardian It's incredibly heartening to see so many tweets like this from police officers. Just so many good guys.
@UnseenOrg @MSHelpline Not at all, good luck.
@PeterBradshaw1 @BBCRadio4 @danielmays That's nice! Thank you for saying so.
@alfiemoore @Humberbeat Ooh, do you know DS John Burrell? He said something after a case last year that made me think, I really like the cut of his jib.
@Westeros_Kanye If you're a cop, magician and singer, that really is excellent range. You're like an Only Connector.
@davidebrady @guardian You didn't read it, did you?
@JuJuJulesJules ! That's a great reply.
In today's Observer, I'm delighted by police officers in Halloween masks and nail varnish. https://t.co/oQeWxQlOBj
@alfiemoore I thought of you when I was writing it!
@ChSuptPMain Thank you! I feel all shy and pink being tweeted by senior police officers - like when the teacher says you can use her first name.
@philius_gooders That's great isn't it? Absolute proof of the pudding.
@ThickBlueLine Thank you for writing!
JANUARY! 💐⭐️🌞🍾🍾🍾 https://t.co/gxvojdv8xz
I've remembered to tweet about Only Connect! That's because it's not on tonight. Off for the football. We're back next Friday, they claim.
@allen_inger Thank you! That's a lovely thing to hear.
@Goatboy667 @CillizzaCNN I've long stopped paying attention.
@PhiSmal Thank God you said that. I thought I'd imagined it.
@SScaddan @GiantGnomes This is a delightful exchange.
@jimmycarr No, yes, ok, that’s brilliant.
@EmmaBullimore That’s very nice of you, thank you!
@Chrisrich25 Well I hope you’re having a lovely day 🎈
@NeilClarke1975 @QuizQuizQuiz @OnlyConnectQuiz Lovely to see you too Neil!
@keiththecamel NO COMMENT
OC quizzers in the OS live audience: sorry not to meet afterwards! We seemed to get herded different ways. Lovely to see you from afar xxx
@BozWallace They make you sign a form promising not to.
@keeleytweet It was behind the sofa
@MarkLister1969 Well, I do ramble.
@Grizzlefur @OnlyConnectQuiz It may have been cruel of me to deconstruct the premise of the question.
@iPhonie That’s nice
@hollyriversshow Ha! Thank you. I weird most people out.
@kingof__fools I MAKE NO COMMENT.
@Gmackematix EXCELLENT WORK, GERARD. I’m saying nothing.
Hmm, live TV. I always wait with interest to hear if I shout something terrible. https://t.co/KXd1Yml6jt
@johnpayne92 But I haven’t got my glasses!
@SScaddan That's great! I admire your commitment if you wore that for a whole night.
@trequartbeasta @Bunney_91 Awwww happy Halloween
Nothing complicated this year. Just your standard Zombie Country Girl. https://t.co/HcolZInOUh
@TheWaster Aw thank you!
@Withnail160 @duvalljeff Well that’s just stupid.
@duvalljeff @Withnail160 Can they do that?? Dear oh dear. That’s horrible.
@PokerStretch83 That’s nice of you! It is true I play a fraction of what pro players do, I’ve basically never been a proper pro, but that’s an advantage.
@SethGillman But “They contain almonds” - the four clues all do. Whether one each or several, *they* contain almonds.
@jeffkimberpoker Lol
@marcclancy1 @paddy_arkwright *certain* return......?
@CamillaLongden EXTREMELY. Applications are open for the next series, see you there.......?
@NigelLindsay1 And, you know, I love Crockfords but...
@roger_witte I guess the difference is, the baby isn't trying to take your money.
@jamesvogl Well, he might have made a good deal on that. Maybe not. But my point was, it might not be just about the money...
@JedFrancis3 ...is very much what the casino was asking itself, I imagine.
In today's Observer: does Phil Ivey ever really lose...? I'm thinking it through like a poker hand. https://t.co/eg9g37QlsY
@richardahunt Lol
Very much looking forward to this TV programme, I'm a big fan. https://t.co/YAYA6PFYq4
@Bobby_Seagull @LouiseLeaver @qikipedia @HedgeNewby @OnlyConnectQuiz Well, I think they might be casting now for the next series.. Is that right @OnlyConnectQuiz ?
@mikekemp60 @_L_M_C_ He’s no Lansbury.
I see the crowd is entranced. https://t.co/DMSxpOWTcu
@arranjambo Oh, get him a nice tie and some crystallised fruits. Lovely.
@dabe1971 Ha! I’ll be there.
Ohhh it’s Friday, isn’t it? Only Connect was on, wasn’t it? Duh! Ah well. It’s now off air til Friday 10th, just to keep me on my toes.
@Vicky_Doorstep xxxx
@Peter_Cubbin Almost mandatory, these days.
@Phoebetron I was just looking at that today! xx
@Stevec4117 @gailatkinson BEAUTIFULLY PUT.... !
@alexanderwoolf That's nice! Thank you very much.
@ChristophPC OH YES.
@DTL @amazingMeagen Not at all, thanks so much for coming.
@gailatkinson Thank you! It was a lovely audience.
@Trudi_Rose Lol. I may keep it on for a week.
@amazingMeagen @DTL Thank you!
@seepyhyde @Mattjohnsons Ha! He’s good news, isn’t he?
@JonnyWooUK YOU TEMPTRESS. Email me! x
@uglybloke4 That’s lovely to hear! Happy Monday!
...I love poker. At times, I think it saved my life. But I don't mind if others worry that it shouldn't be in the Olympics! Best wishes.
I won’t be online today, but to the annoyed pole fans: I'm sorry. I'm truly glad you've found something you love. All I can say is...   1/2
@bobdebilde Lol
@strukkaz I know it is. I did try to cover that in the piece - I'm an old feminist from a different generation, that's all I can say really. Sorry.
In today's Observer, an ageing feminist embraces a new Olympics. EMBRACES it.   https://t.co/rqdwzV3oVa
@louisecoatz Sadly (or happily, God knows) I have to go offline now. Please take those horrible lies down and don't repeat them. It's AWFUL.
@phizzog11 @louisecoatz Thank you, that's exactly right. Though to be clear: I think it IS black and white whether rapists should be prosecuted and YES THEY SHOULD!
@louisecoatz YOUR article doesn't make me anything. You can't just slap lies on people and make them true. That is abuse too. Please, please stop.
@louisecoatz @drchriscarson .. I’m sorry that you’re so inexplicably angry with me but I CANNOT let these evil lies stand and you must stop stop, it’s really wrong.
@louisecoatz @drchriscarson The piece did not say that because I DON’T THINK THAT. I really would love to leave this alone, I don’t generally rise to abuse and..
@louisecoatz @jondrytay @gilescoren No I didn’t
@louisecoatz @drchriscarson No I didn’t
@thateddguy @louisecoatz That’s exactly what I said. Thank you. NEVER that he shouldn’t face justice. These lies are terribly damaging and dangerous and wrong.
@drchriscarson @louisecoatz It’s very difficult. I hate the idea of that, it’s so extreme. But I think probably yes. “Child rape apologist”?!! That can’t stand.
@jondrytay @louisecoatz I believe with all my heart that everyone should be free to say what they think and feel, however dreadful, but not to lie about others.
@jondrytay @louisecoatz Thanks Jon. Louise, I’m serious. You are lying and it’s very very wrong. I really cannot allow this evil misrepresentation. You must delete.
@louisecoatz This is a disgusting slander and I’d like you to delete it immediately. You really must. It’s a terrible, terrible lie. Take it down.
@louisecoatz @gilescoren That is NOT the same as saying he shouldn’t go to prison, and it’s dangerous and stupid and wrong to say that it is. Just stop it.
@louisecoatz @gilescoren 3 years ago I wrote that I wanted to assault Polanski for his vile crimes but, reading about his terrible childhood, violence wouldn’t help.
@louisecoatz @gilescoren Louise, I don’t know why you’re spitting this poison all over your twitter feed but it’s utter bullshit and you should shut up.
@CJackHunt Lovely.
@scarahstarer SO YOUNG.
@boykettle_dave I only listen very occasionally. I love the people on it now, but even the theme music chokes me up a bit.
@JuliaPitman Looking at your three messages, I would say we think the same thing.
@JuliaPitman Oh I absolutely didn't say (or think) he should escape punishment. Only "punishment with violence" which (I wrote) was my first instinct.
@spbeanses Yeah, mine’s lovely too. There are plenty of gentle ones, thank God. Night night.
@brigidichka Of COURSE it isn’t, I mean Christ, #metoo, who hasn’t? That has GOT TO STOP. But I truly don’t think G meant it was harmless, that’s all.
@spbeanses I do like it! Exactly! Ignore that grumpy old man, it was a LOVELY tweet about your sister and just what a nice person WOULD think.
@hugorifkind Lol
@spbeanses I MEAN QUITE! Thank you for that.
@RichRance Lol
@Moppettshow @Keawyeds No no, I think @Keawyeds *changed his mind* - a rare ability, these days, and much to be treasured!
@seabisquick Ach, I always need a hug! Thank you.
@jonathanshainin @Keawyeds And that’s it, I can’t comment on this any more! I’m not my brother’s keeper etc. But, for me, this piece had its heart in the right place.
@jonathanshainin I’m with @Keawyeds, it wasn’t cricket to quote that short bit. At least let the whole piece speak for itself.
@Keawyeds @jonathanshainin I don’t really want to get involved, but you and I read the piece differently. I found it quite thoughtful, sad and well intentioned. And..
@Keawyeds @jonathanshainin Thank you! It certainly seems ironic for the “editor of long reads” to tweet such a short, decontextualised extract. Ah well. Not my fight..
@Keawyeds @jonathanshainin But why do people keep tweeting that paragraph without the next line - “And rightly” - which is the point of the piece?!
@welshbooky Thank you, I appreciate that.
@AllsGood6 lol. I probably make it worse.
@MikeFlynn19 Cherish them!
@JamesHinnigan @keefymc That’s a nice thing to say, thank you
@barnyboatman Lol
@keefymc @gilescoren I thought it was very nicely written and it made me feel sad. I'm not one of the people who are angry about one decontextualised paragraph.
Lovely Mick Lee is on tonight! His visible enjoyment of the questions are a real highlight of the series for me. #OnlyConnect, BBC2 at 8.30.
@welshbooky @gilescoren Well no you wouldn't, because I *am* her and he's my brother and I think he's great and I'm proud of him. No need to copy me in next time.
@Benphilipps Thanks Ben x
@Liberty_GB Are those cheese puns? I've heard better.
@mrmarksteel (If you know that already then the tweet is even more genius. If not, text me your address).
@mrmarksteel Have the publishers sent you the Only Connect book yet? It refers to an incomplete set, which THIS VERY TWEET would complete.
One of tonight's contestants is a qualified cheesemonger.  Only Connect, 8.30pm on BBC Two.
@Caroh28 I remember your name! Very sorry for your loss, warmest wishes.
@Simonwardell1 !! Wow, that really is a likeness. I'm copying in @gilescoren
@steverobinson46 It is cruel. I wish you strength and comfort.
@LadyDanni1 ! You have a very good way of looking at life.
@orkneybell That's nice. Those days seem so long ago now.
@jenwen12 @CaraCooper1 Ah, now, you see, I think you *will* hear their voice again. Perhaps not yet, and perhaps in a different way than before, but it's there.
@GladKent Don't resist! Your mum was clearly making the world a brighter and more cheerful place... I'm a fan myself...
@sambadgirl1981 Well that's heartbreaking, I'm really terribly sorry. I wish you strength at this very sad time. Many messages of loss; you're not alone.
@oiyouandy My lord that memory is very "him", in so many ways. Thank you!
@dinoshapes You will find yourself again. For now.. you know, there are millions of us, and I know how you feel.
@themounts I promise it'll be okay. But this bit is f***ing awful. Good luck and best wishes.
@NainnaLeader Of course you were. That happens a lot. I could hear "Old Man River" 8000 times and it would still happen. Good luck on the journey x
@Judyastley Ha! Wasn't that helpful! Thank you.
@Kate_NW11 Why would I mind that?! The yahrzeit light is burning as we speak. Thank you very much.
Thanks for your lovely messages xx
@jayrayner1 Thanks Jay.
@jewell_martin I can imagine.
@iwm21 He looks lovely.
@simonlambert50 That's pretty much it, isn't it? I'm sorry, it must be desperately sad and frustrating, my thoughts are with you.
@stevedyson Thank you! And what a great picture.
@Su55Mc I EXPECT IT LOOKED MAGNIFICENT.
@Groovydaz39 Oh goodness, best wishes to you too.
@r3dsmansour Of course it's nice! It's lovely.
@BelsizeLibrary xxxxx
@jenwen12 You must be struggling awfully. Yes you'll adjust, recover and life will be happy again, but what a heartbreaking time. My warmest wishes.
@PortnallRob Gosh, that's going back!
@cloomahara That's such a lovely thing to hear, I can't tell you.
@PaulRutterford1 That's a nice thing to say.
@SewellRobert He must have been in a particularly good mood, he loved it there! Thank you.
@Nigella_Lawson xxxxxxxx
@simonblackwell xxx he was a bespoke dad... never took me fishing.
@RachelVMartin ..and gratitude that they were ever there at all. You're at the really tough bit. But it will be okay. Good luck x
@RachelVMartin For ever it remains unbearable SOMETIMES, but most of the time, by some magic, you just start remembering with happiness and warmth...
@RachelVMartin Oh I'm so sorry. People will tell you it gets easier and you won't believe them, you'll think it's different for you, but it *does*.
@JeremyJHardy xxxx
It’s ten years today since my father died. I miss him. https://t.co/iv2MQtLxJv
@Kezly I don't know what you mean. You must be imagining it 👻
@TessabellePixie @OnlyConnectQuiz Yeah, mine too.
@Petergurney @JonathanLittle Thank you, that's very kind of you!
@LucyFaulkes I'm afraid I was not. I mean, I was in the audience of several million at home, but not in the studio.
@sybilvane_74 Ah, I'm sorry. Is it a geography thing? Move here!
@JonandRoGilbert I like a lovely question!
@AdamPreston06 I'm glad. It was a slow burner.
@AHappyHiveling Ha! Thank you.
@sunsettide @qikipedia That's very pretty.
@superkrispydj REMAIN ON THAT HIGH
@superkrispydj No the clue was just for the word "Christmas", not the whole line
@DLombari Season's greetings!
@ellejack1824 @RealDMitchell I've never wanted me more.
@mslhthomas Happy new year!
@peterbates49 ! I suppose that must be next week's.
@NickLister9 Ooh you're good. Literally nobody else has asked that question.
@Geoff_McGivern It'll make sense to those who stick with it til the end ;-)
@Craig_Higgins Stay tuned and you'll see ....
Tonight at 8.30 on BBC2: the Only Connect Christmas special!  Ho ho ho 🎄🎄🎄🎅🎅🎅
@coshgirl Ah but surely that's not about driving, it's about *cars*, driverless or otherwise. Getting rid of cars completely is a different argument.
@Eliot_Finch Oh thank you! That's very cheering.
@CHAIRRDRF ..what I'm saying as "drivel", I think we're too far apart to debate this in Twitter-length messages. Thanks anyway and best wishes.
@CHAIRRDRF If you mean "others", I covered that point in the article. That isn't a counter argument to what I was saying. But since you dismissed..
@rayjb1963 Sure. He can thinks what he likes too. I have no problem with him expressing his opinion, only his eagerness to denigrate and edit mine.
@heatherrhian Yes, that's totally stupid and terrible.
@shlokes Do you know how unusual it is, in this day and age, to have a changeable mind? Very cool.
@PaulDiamond3 I'M SORRY I MISSED IT.
@CHAIRRDRF Sorry, but it's not for you - a man - to sound off about what "control" means to me or the women of Saudi Arabia. I'll think what I like.
@NickiKelly ..drive otherwise for reasons of physical impairment will be a wonderful thing. But if we lose driving completely, I'd be very sad about it.
@NickiKelly ...about a guide dog in the footwell of a Mini. She missed driving hugely too. Yes, I would say driverless cars for people who couldn't...
@NickiKelly That's a very interesting angle. We talked to a blind woman in the first series of Women Talking About Cars, she told a hilarious story...
In today's Observer, I've written about why I'll be sorry to see driverless cars. https://t.co/4M3DACkM9W
@roscogordon !! You're looking in the wrong places.
@BigGreig1 @TheLastLeg I genuinely don't understand the question
@emma__j__w @TheLastLeg @bbcstrictly I NEVER WILL 💃💃💃
@TheLastLeg Go Peacock! Shake those tail feathers!
@SidneyOSParsons @JimHearson @itvstudios IT IS SO FULL OF THOSE THINGS
@CaveFord Well, she pre-dates standardised spelling, so perhaps you weren't wrong!
@danjewellmedia That's nice! Thank you very much.
@a7f15ade6c3a494 @oscarTFpowell Yes
@PABadrinath It's actually quite cunning to avoid specifics. That would be my secret tip, if I ever gave any. @charlietabloid
@rosiefreckle THAT'S A LOVELY IMAGE
@Kildimo62 For me, he's got a lot of competition.
@welsh_in_london Really? In the pub? That makes me feel very proud! (No doubt it was an ad break in some kind of sports match on the other side...)
@JimHearson @itvstudios I don't trust anyone
@SongoftheOss @TheLastLeg A tiny crocodile
@ElizabethBower I HAVE IT IN THE BATH
@TheRealOzzMan68 Thank you! I love America, but I try not to pretend I understand anything about anyone...
@VickySBrewster !! That's like life before Google
@exitthelemming There is a team I think you'll like tonight.........
What comes next:   Jane Seymour Catherine of Aragon Anne Boleyn...  ?  Find out on Only Connect! Tonight at 8.30 (or thereabouts) on BBC2.
@GrahamofBushey He is a great quiz master!
@klplant1 Well that's nice! Thank you very much!
@sarahearlyyears !!!
Oh, good work. https://t.co/PwQka2NKkU
@AndyRHamilton Well thank you very much!
@BelindaBG @OnlyConnectQuiz Ha! Good idea.
@RebeccaAshton68 @IAMRoadSmart @racfoundation @Pirelli Thank you! That was fun, and nice to meet you all
@SnikkyB @TheLastLeg @arobertwebb @Channel4 @OpenMike_TV I mean... you know we've met before, right?
@gilescoren Everyone struggles with Only Connect...
@ribbyrib Thank you very much
@gilescoren I mean, I wouldn't want that quoted out of context.
@Nick_Holland_ @peopleofyorks @FelixhuddsCat @WoodsieGirl No, that's a lovely thing to say! Thank you!
@CThomsonGold Perfect.
@paulaustin123 Thank you, that's very kind of you.
@profdwh Thank you very much!
@JudgeRoySnyder @OnlyConnectQuiz Sit tight, my friend...
I must say, there are some lovely pictures on the #grandpics thread where I didn't post. This is my current favourite. https://t.co/Dv1QuS5qMZ
In today's Observer, you won't find a photo of my grandparents. But I have tried to draw them. https://t.co/xmFDOdTuSB #grandpics
@ShootTheSinger You must be a healthy person. Ours "makes us" plates of chips...
@Itsgillibb @guardiannews Thank you, that's very nice of you to say
@tinytiptoes @OnlyConnectQuiz SEE YOU NEXT SERIES
@tinknevertalks That's very sweet.
@NeilClarke1975 @FalkirkBairn01 Please...
@snodkins That's terrifying
@ThomMannish @Homebase_uk Wrong way round. I go to Homebase quite often, but I'm not doing their voiceover!
@twittwootwiggy Lol Just about.
@FalkirkBairn01 We'd never steer you wrong
@squelchuk @OnlyConnectQuiz GOOD LUCK
@a7f15ade6c3a494 @oscarTFpowell DON'T ANSWER THAT
@Philippa_Perry That's pretty much it, I guess.
@BugattiTrust Oh thank you! Very glad you liked it.
@QuizQuizQuiz HAVE A LOVELY TIME xxxxx
@spjwhitwell In a way.
(One of the quizzers is Oscar Powell, of University Challenge fame....)
The teams on tonight's Only Connect are like the two different sides of my personality. It was really odd watching them battle. BBC2, 8.30pm
@TheVoidTLMB Thank you!
@liddlelamzy !! Uber have literally just lost their licence because of insufficient background checks.
Last in the series of Women Talking About Cars, featuring Claudia Winkleman and Morwenna Banks, is now online: https://t.co/4unwfG6uHC
@Suethorogood21 Thank you!
@TheVoidTLMB I do.
@sonnlich @BBCRadio4 @ClaudiaWinkle You are correct.
@larkingrumple Truly magnificent.
@TurtonSam All hail Prince Christopher!
@AndrewReadan1 What you ought to have said is that MY FATHER WAS ALSO ON RADIO 4. That's a much better argument.
@AndrewReadan1 What if it's not that way round? What if I met him because we both work in TV, and it helps to have a best friend who does the same job?!
@Breathwick Thank you!!
@JoodiG @DottydeBono @BBCRadio4 Aw that's nice, but that lady was brilliant and wonderful all by herself, no thanks to me.
@fatgazbo @ClaudiaWinkle @BBCRadio4 YES BEST. BEST BEST.
@Fankle Yes, we have a 2-year-old. But for future reference, I know you mean it nicely but that's probably not a question you should ask people!
@otterking Yes!!!
@michjperry Yes! One of my favourite things about the series is finding so many wonderful people in the audience.
@taxation_theft9 Ha! My pleasure.
@dannyh197 That's a nice coincidence! I'm glad you were listening!
@Fankle I was! This is an old show!
@J5V @HoratioMortimer Everything always ends in a funeral.
@findochtywifie @MumBot2000 I know, I know...
@HoratioMortimer Really? The poker book? I hope they weren't on the funeral section.
@keiththecamel I've replied to this as a "quote tweet", not sure if that means you get alerted or not!
It's actually on Amazon - and may be free if you're trialling something.. you know I never understand these things.. https://t.co/OIIgiKCN1L https://t.co/zwV1J1n8qK
@Harmaxia @BBCRadio4 @ClaudiaWinkle Thank you very much!
Last in the series of #WomenTalkingAboutCars on @BBCRadio4 tonight at 6.30, with one of my favourite people in the world: @ClaudiaWinkle
@twriley1 @pixelatedboat I think it is actually a parody. But not long before Mr T is beyond it, not long.
@zippygwr Sorry! Mind you, it might be terrible. If not, we'll make a series and then it'll be a lot easier to get in!
@SeanSeankirwan @pixelatedboat What?
@MumBot2000 Oh, thank you very much, but it's not really news - that's a repeat of a series from three years ago!
Looking at the pictures, I have no idea how I persuaded myself that "nobody could guess" I was pregnant.. https://t.co/YuDLaVIHr5 https://t.co/m2T00yCXBk
@deathfistkilla @mcintoi1 The lot, as usual.
@mcintoi1 @cathynewman  https://t.co/qeVQDVW3sd
@cathynewman Have written x
@cathynewman Hello - I'm so sorry, I only just saw this. But I couldn't have done it anyway; Tuesday is poker night. I've got 6 hungry degenerates here.
@andre_lefevre It may well be neither.
@Cyfenw1 Who's "we"?! It's a Welsh show and proud of it, I was chatting in Welsh with a Welsh person. You're a lone voice of rage. Chill out. Bye!
@defsdoor @ClaudiaWinkle You'll have a clue this Thursday at 6.30 on Radio Four...
@redwellyfeats TIME WILL TELL.
A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE. I mean, literally, God love him. #ColesToBlackpool
"What an entrance" ?! Seriously?! #ColesToBlackpool
Let me be clear: yes I watched my brother's show. Now, it's all about @revrichardcoles. Priorities. #ColesToBlackpool
GO RICHARD
@MacrolensMn Lol
@Ollie_WHU Ha! Happy Christmas.
@moggyroe Me; on that show, it's rarely an exact science so I have to call it - but they will shout in my ear if they think I'm completely wrong.
@fiflippy @gilescoren That's not on yet.
@philburns I love it as a viewer, but it's not for me.
Do they all dance on Strictly tonight, or is it one of those ones where half of them do and half or next week?
@Sud_Pri I'm wondering what to have for tea.
@OztBeach Oh, I expect so.
@merimaat Depends how it goes!
On 25th Oct, I'm making a pilot for a new TV show! Click here if you'd like free tickets to watch an experiment:   https://t.co/irVBoGYCNh
@MuntBmunt @David_Suchet If you mean it was pronounced Ariad-ney, yes it was. But people pronounce names differently, and she's a fictional character.
@Cyfenw1 I think you get cross too easily, my friend.
@KatharineAbrey @MuntBmunt Interesting question. Depends whether you mean the book or TV version...
@MidWalesRefSoc @BBCScrumV @BBCTwo @OnlyConnectQuiz That's nice
@PygmyLoris Grrrrrrr
@Marie_Donn @jesusluvsdagays @MuntBmunt Quite.
@LeighPontypridd @stetho @OnlyConnectQuiz I wasn't watching and I don't remember (it was a while ago), but from your tweet I'd guess croeso cynnes?
@dan_lepard HAVE A NICE WEEKEND
@stetho @OnlyConnectQuiz Lol
@ksuttonibt_kate YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
@MuntBmunt You pronounce it "Arriane"! In that name, the d is supposed to be silent!
@dwmal1 @NickTreby @ednl I love you all. Very deeply.
@m8ricks Thank you! That'll be three years ago, in fact... November 2014 I happen to remember.
Here is last night's episode of Women Talking About Cars, with the brilliant and very funny Esther Rantzen: https://t.co/gxONDBW9gZ
There are some great questions on tonight's Only Connect, and some very lovely quizzers. BBC2 at 8.30pm in most areas, maybe 9.30 in Wales?
@chaoticfarming @ottoparts7 Yes yes you too.... 🍰🍰🍰
@EarlGreyDecaf @Fortnums I prefer my gin on the cornflakes.
@MosheLeibSol I was literally talking about you THIS EVENING! Amazing. (Tweeting at 8pm?! I've never understood liberals...) Warmest wishes, VCM
@ottoparts7 Happy birthday! It's early, but I believe in celebrating for at least a week.
@gonzalas50 @BBCRadio4 This is the second series. Please send it to Age UK, 0800 169 87878 or https://t.co/Mi82YpUhz4
Tonight on #womentalkingaboutcars (@bbcradio4, 6.30pm) I'm talking to Esther Rantzen! A very clever, funny, often underestimated person.
@incognitoUK Hi Howard, I'm a bit useless on email, just too much to juggle so it doesn't get done. Sorry! Best wishes, VCM
@RicardoWensley @74matt @richardosman God knows mine doesn't.
@richardosman That's such an incredibly pleasing joke.
@JamesBowmanPwC Hmm. It's a bit straightforward for them.
@Baddiel @guardian Ooh that's a good snippet.
@AledThomas99 @OnlyConnectQuiz You're half right. The clue was in episode 1. But you're miles ahead, most people haven't noticed at all.
@mrmarksteel Thank you! And yes, so annoying. As if there isn't currently anything to ACTUALLY GET WORRIED ABOUT.
@ThomasAtcheson @quizquizquiz Seriously, we're one short? It's beautiful otherwise. Time to start insisting the crab apple be referred to as "the greenoid".
@rocstar_77 Well... he had a swastika armband. That's pretty Nazi.
I'm sorry said I didn't remember 'Allo 'Allo being that funny. I think I may have been wrong there. https://t.co/vwMQGdRzv3
@PascalLTH @RupertMyers Well, I think the opposite is the case.
@PowerfulTux I'm sorry about that. I'm not saying it wasn't, only that I don't remember it! I'm probably completely wrong.
@DrMatthewSweet @BriW74 lol
@itsa_me_gameboy Aw, that's nice of you, thank you
In today's Observer, I think it's fine for Paul Hollywood to dress up as a Nazi.   https://t.co/pdZJdmdOnr
@ianb74 It's in the Observer!!! On the Guardian website...
@ddayhistorian Thank you very much
@buteosam Thank you very much!
@reallylolo @jenshearman @sanjoysen100 @wildigital @johnpayne92 You're misreading it! Jennifer's saying she has no idea who won! From which you can deduce only that it *might not* have been her team...
THAT'S NICE https://t.co/HHB34ECJj0
@john_melfyn @ukslim No, it's genuinely fascinating! Except you made up the name Probert. What about Pdavid?
@bevismusson @mssygngrbrd @sheepsheed1 @Brays_Cottage @AlexJCall @reallylolo @radioheadjen @charlania He seems like a man who's always prepared for anything.
@SooziPye You're in safe hands.
@kropotkinderegg Of course, they may only have had one copy.
@ukslim TIDY.
@helholds @johnpayne92 Ah, now, if that's what you like in a contestant, hang on for Mick Lee.
@mssygngrbrd @bevismusson @sheepsheed1 @Brays_Cottage @AlexJCall @reallylolo @radioheadjen @charlania See previous tweet - he's on Twitter!
@reelbigdawson !!!!!!!
Right-minded people always fall for our wonderful quizzers on Only Connect, but I've never seen as much love as there is for @johnpayne92
@stuartprovan Cheers!
@benmrowe High, of course, in so many ways. This is a big top 3.
@sanjoysen100 @johnpayne92 There he is on Twitter! A lot of love in my timeline for you, John. (You're wonderful too Sanjoy, but - like me - slower to sing...)
@lydmizz @QuizQuizQuiz I mean... SOMETIMES COMES TO PARTIES DRESSED AS EMILY DICKINSON? Impossible not to love.
@HamHayley SEE YOU NEXT SERIES
@gronya Not at all. I'm very proud to hear you make that connection. These things really matter.
@Whitterz67 Yes! Not vegan...
@MrsCartlidge HE SHOULD AND HE WILL.
@gronya I'm glad he loved the show and it makes you think of him. Thank you! My dad loved Countdown.
@QuizQuizQuiz There is. I love James Manson too. Truth is there may be 20 people in my top three.
@StarrOutlook Too late.
@Cage93 Not oddly. Straightforwardly.
@reelbigdawson HD !
@mijath There's more to come.....
@kropotkinderegg There's more to come IN THIS VERY SHOW.
I like John Payne ENORMOUSLY. He's in my top 3 favourite quizzers this series. #onlyconnect
@sosamuk @MrBoom Because the Welsh have better things to do.
It's never accidental. https://t.co/J1U1Cfh7O4
@Smiff68 I mean, of course.
@Cfpercy Lol
WELSH TIMING AS BELOW. @MrBoom clearly mingles with different Welsh folk than I do... https://t.co/SAnld8T2xE
Warning re tonight's Only Connect: you will need your wits about you RIGHT FROM THE OFF...
@1WorldOfStupid Ach, I wish I knew.
AND IT'S ON AGAIN TONIGHT!!!! 8.30pm, BBC Two. https://t.co/ylNZsCOAnl
@PhilB1965 Oh that's nice! Thank you very much.
@IckleAndy Ah yes, thank you.
@keiththecamel ! A JIGSAW. That's a lovely image.
@PaulGre72698446 Excellent compliment, thank you!
@twirlynoodle That was me. I'm the writers. YOU'RE WELCOME TO THEM ugh ugh ugh
@newberryfruits1 !! It may be a common story...
Here's the full line-up for tonight’s Women Talking About Cars on @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm: Morwenna Banks, Jo Brand and me. https://t.co/YAByiLy5Je
Ohhhhhhh yes. https://t.co/Ab1ZcwUehc
Tonight on Women Talking About Cars (@BBCRadio4, 6.30pm) my guest is the wonderful @iamjobrand https://t.co/7rBOp5gMPz
@incognitoUK Hi - not sure who this is from but no it doesn't, that's from a very long time ago!
@67Snowy @RadioTimes @stevedyson Well, I hope you're right. Truth is I think you probably are.
@JackFleet37 Oh that's nice! I'm really glad people are watching that again.
@PortoonArt @DavidCleghorn Ha! That could be worth as much as £8 one day.
@annaframe @HayDove @arobertwebb I was really sorry not to see you there! Hope all going well up north.
@DavidCleghorn With unfortunate timing, I was about six months pregnant when we made that series so I had to fake it.
@HayDove @arobertwebb Oh thank you very much!
@RevRichardColes If that's a euphemism, I salute you.
@Geoff_McGivern @BebeNeuwirth !!! RIGHTLY. On both counts.
@marky249 WATER
@TooaPenny @Bestival @OnlyConnectQuiz CHEERS
@davidbrider @arobertwebb I'm not signing things tomorrow, it's not my book!! I'm just the hack interviewer.
@Philippa_Perry It's good isn't it? This one even better, I think.
@Geoff_McGivern Ha! The other one would never be in that slot...
@4randomwords My natural time.
Well let's not go overboard. I mean *perfect*.... https://t.co/upFeGypbpg
(In my opinion, by the way, it's a *brilliant* series. By many leagues the second best thing that could be on.)
Tonight at 8.30pm on BBC Two, after University Challenge............      ......a new series of Upstart Crow!   Oh yes.  THAT I remember.
@Jontwothreefour @arobertwebb No. We're both too frightened of the answer.
@iceymonkey If anything, the usual uncomfortable silence on Mondays at 8.30 will be replaced, thankfully, by noise.
Tomorrow I'm interviewing @arobertwebb in London about his new book. Tickets available here in exchange for money: https://t.co/PtOCntMzyn
@RoyWilliam Your original question was whether there were multiple takes and no, there's one take.
@RoyWilliam They know what will be said! They've told us us the facts in advance! We haven't had them investigated by private detectives.
@smbelsare Thank you very much! Nearly ten years have passed, but I'm still as proud of that reverse scam as pretty much anything I've ever done.
@nickovdw IMPRESSIVE
@just_jesshere Aw, happy birthday!
@RoyWilliam I don't know, and no we don't!
@jenna_rater I don't really know what that is, I'm afraid!
@DontFollowLee There's an extremely complicated series of further qualifying factors.
@NeilClarke1975 @OnlyConnectQuiz Cheers!
@paulgibson1 @bengoldacre It could certainly re-invigorate things. Let's discuss @QuizQuizQuiz @OnlyConnectQuiz
@keiththecamel Tell him I make it all up.
@NeilClarke1975 @OnlyConnectQuiz That's really great!!!
Excellent work here, from the offspring of the Cricketers' captain. https://t.co/DVxvXIOAGB
@PatFairlea @philburns @Herring1967 Halfpenny-worth, sure, but I assumed the question was about why that's "daft". Maybe it's just literal: you're daft and not worth much!
@keiththecamel 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
@MrBillByrne I don't remember the question but from what you say, yes!
@zetadoc Well, you know, you've got to give everyone a chance...
@philburns @Herring1967 I don't know! We didn't do that one!
@wallaceme @joshspero @lpf20 @AlanOl4 Well done everyone.
@Littlun007 Well done! 🦁 💦
@althamaltham @littlebroad84 Lol
@littlebroad84 I think in English it's a much milder sense of irritation and embarrassment, rather than grief
@lpf20 @AlanOl4 It was simply a knowledgeable discussion of agricultural varieties. @joshspero
@DaveCurran99 I worry myself sometimes.
@NeonatalMatron @OnlyConnectQuiz OF COURSE
@mpettitt Don't get me started
@RedLlwynog @Gwaredd28 ffyslyd ffyslyd...
@AndreaSJones Hurry back there at once!
@cowper_anne You're preaching to the converted here... I think you might have misread my tweet.
@AlanOl4 @lpf20 Apples! Delicious tasting Jonathans.. all apples!
@EBDramatherapy FIGHT THROUGH IT
@geekychappy Ha! Well done. Episode one contained the clue...
@LCGiblin DRINK FROM THE BOTTLE
@LappinGraham I assume you've been eating a lot of fish.
@KateBridle1 Ahh, the old "Gladys Knight And The Pips" manoeuvre. I miss it too.
@Soulstorm99 @aechambersnove1 Thank you, yes exactly, it is DEFINITELY more than half the time.
@travistest RIGHTLY 🍾🍾🍾
@littlebroad84 It's a term for words that mean something different in their original language than they come to mean in English.
@NotTallorRich Well that's VERY NICE OF YOU.
@obisnoozey 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
Only Connect beginning now IF YOU'RE NOT IN WALES (in which case, my sympathies) https://t.co/1GR0izb5fr
@IanHallard It's going! In just four short months....
@literarywhore Not this week. But soon enough...
@RedLlwynog Let's be honest, there is one main storyline.
@iam_alix Thank you!
@HoggRob No I haven't! I just don't see all the tweets I get, it's hit and miss!
Also, here is the first episode of Women Talking About Cars, with wonderful, funny and moving Sheila Hancock: https://t.co/kbBMEygCKX
Thanks very much to the tweeter who reminded me: ONLY CONNECT IS ON TONIGHT! Yay! 8.30pm, BBC Two, in at least some places!
@GrahamRickman Oh! Of course! WELL DONE, thank you!!
@helenavis2 @BBCRadio4 Well done him, being man enough to admit it...
@molejunior Happy birthday!
@jpharraw @BBCRadio4 I won't I won't I won't
@mollypotter66 See you there!
@TelscombeGarden @NigelSlater @BBCRadio4 Thank you very much!
@MsHMTanner @BBCRadio4 Oh, I'm not good at that sort of thing. I may unearth one in the next few days.
@inge_lala @BBCRadio4 That makes me VERY HAPPY TO READ.
@tweetierach @BBCRadio4 That's nice! There are three more episodes in the series - all amazing women.
@F1Ruaraidh @BBCRadio4 WELCOME TO WTAC.
@ozymandias57 All things considered, that is a heartwarming image.
@kathycaton Thank you! I admire her massively.
@SuzannaWood @BBCRadio4 Oh that's very kind! Thank you.
@RachelCarnac @BBCRadio4 Happy driving!
@pjmolineaux I know, she's just so wonderful.
@DuncsMcMillan Thank you very much!
@NigelSlater @BBCRadio4 Hurray!
@MrsCupcake79 Lol. More careful while car shopping...?
@beeeze That's never very cheering, is it?
The new series of Women Talking About Cars starts in 15 minutes on @BBCRadio4. I'm very proud of the series, I really hope people enjoy it.
@johnlbirch Happy anniversary!
Tonight, Women Talking About Cars returns to @BBCRadio4 at 6.30pm! First guest Sheila Hancock is just *great*. https://t.co/yshbI617fr
@Geoff_McGivern @RareNeilPearson Yes, good work indeed. (And good work you too last night, Geoff! You were brilliant as always, in a brilliant show).
@RareNeilPearson PLEASE. Among Only Connect stalwarts, it's the first thing we turn to. #oohlovelyelegantsolution
@MickBlizz @18 I am DETERMINED not to forget!
@Kaibanator We've had a few poker players! Not ones I already knew though.
@BarryMeps Not as far as I know! You should be safe to continue shopping there.
@whomobilejay I know, I know...
@SimonMonger @lisapantelli I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU
@sodiumlights No, you're not. But I don't mind it.
@JasonKingHQ If only. I LOVE Ruth Madoc.
@RugbyDiscipline @steviepattisond (Or, as we say on Only Connect, Ll)
@RugbyDiscipline @steviepattisond Lol
@blickbuster That's a question for @QuizQuizQuiz and @OnlyConnectQuiz - good luck!
@GilliansDeco Are you saying this isn't?
@HannahKettle @Lawreate I mean, you say "fun"...
@CubaDrive_Vinny Nothing like a bit of roughage.
@Acelliott79 You can try...
@themanicflea SNT VRY THN G ?
The Only Connect book is published this week! Look, here it is all shiny and hieroglyphy.   https://t.co/E6ydZX2WG1
@howtoacademy Flawless! Although I rather like it both ways. (Please do not quote out of context).
I think it's How *Not* To Be A Boy... Although, in a way, @arobertwebb's message is ALSO "How now to be..." https://t.co/h5sq4fwQZz
@DeanMcMackin Thank you!
@tvmeband @OnlyConnectQuiz Nothing about them is ever what you'd expect.
I COULDN'T BE PROUDER. https://t.co/Jr7eKpbXHN
@sheep_not Pinching my what?
@gilescoren GRRRR #dementors  👻 👻 👻 see you soon xxx
@ajohnduncan @gilescoren YES. Oh, you mean him.
@gilescoren I think that is UNMITIGATED NONSENSE! You're confusing populist with popular. Her witty, creative books are widely loved, RIGHTLY.
@gilescoren WHY WOULD YOU TWEET THAT? JK Rowling is a great, popular writer and a brave, kind, heroic person! You are SUCH a muggle.
@agathatorrance @redtoothpoker Good luck!
@paddy_arkwright @samwires @onlyconnect Demand now qualifies as "overwhelming".
@lycrabiker @PrivateEyeNews I didn't, but not surprised they're on the case
@dmf500 @onlyconnectuk !! You must be including the invisible Q
@gadget37 Very interesting, thank you! I imagine you're also strong in the field of voice recognition software ;-)
@mathsmalin Fair enough; not just allowed, it's often NECESSARY
@steve_arbor NEVER
@samwires There are no box sets. Your tweet literally constitutes the demand.
@dbbas I like those cards enormously.
@mrgb63 Lol
@SaffPowell I'm sure he's got more important things to think about, but I certainly send best wishes and hope it went very well!
@Kirky1701 Tonic?
@JonnyBWoode So people say. I still watch films on VHS.
@QuizQuizQuiz I think the BBC have a standard guide for saying almost everything, I'm just not sure where they keep it! Possibly somewhere in 1987.
@JohnFarrar Too late
@mickmuldoon Yes...
@QuizQuizQuiz @Teresa_ETC !!! Had a crack at it? I said what you told me to say!
Lots of tweets about this. Sorry! I didn't know that one; I asked the team for a pronunciation guide and pronounced it how they told me. https://t.co/l37IXNXUs8
Ohhh. It's Friday, isn't it? Only Connect was on? I give up! I'll never remember! I'll tweet it regularly again when we go back to Mondays!
@Itsallaboutcake @Pani_Bufetowa Minced! Minced oaths!
@QuizQuizQuiz @Bobby_Seagull (Mr Waley-Cohen's own Christmas list becomes clear...) 🎄🎄🎄
@shaneehickey !! No, I've just got a lot of makeup on, there's strong lighting and they've chosen the nicest one from about 50.
@Spencertipster Thanks very much!
@TimJones15 I can certainly see why you thought of me
@SenseiChanning @keiththecamel Lol
@TheGraspGroup I'm sorry to hear it - though if you've escaped the demons, you haven't lost the future. You're free to build one. Good luck.
@MonkeyFacedGod Very much so
@keiththecamel Hope you're all well! It's been too long x
@keiththecamel ..with all the other sorts of shop. But other sorts aren't kept afloat with these ghastly zombie machines! Bookies shouldn't be either.
@keiththecamel ..of several in a row in one shopping street. But I'd be sad if there were NO high street bookies and it was only online, just as I would..
@keiththecamel Yes absolutely - I hope I made that point v clearly in the original column the week before. Definitely don't like these grim stretches...
@Henrypercy5 It does sound brilliant
@jamesvogl That's really kind, thanks very much James!
@nickpwarner No, because that was his title not his surname!
@PaulaMHarvey No no, I'd be terrible. But thank you.
@grahamjohnson1 Well I'm proud to hear it. Leave them alone. Be free!
@bobbarrowman Everyone was lovely! Thank you, nice to meet you too.
@gumbleinthewabe @PFCAaronRMartin Aw. I'd have given you the points.
@PFCAaronRMartin WELCOME
@wondermouse No doubt her strength is the wall round.
@jdthndr Well, a lot less. I mean, you can't chase your losses so madly with a cap, even within the one shop never mind several!
@cpwernham I don't believe it.
@TheMickWeston That makes me feel wistful. That could easily return, just maybe in fewer shops.
@SufferingVillan That's very nice of you to say.
@PeterPallin @ThePhoenicSoul Also, if you go £100 behind and know it would take 20 or 30 spins to win it back (rather than one), you're less like to chase desperately.
@slepkane Oh thank you very much!
@Mr_Andy_Johnson Ha! That's very kind of you. I'm not a proper journalist at all - and there are some bad ones, but there are some great heroic ones.
@acbowles80 Yes, to people in gambling it kind of reads like that too ..
@jezzeralexander Thanks very much
There was a lot of correspondence after last week's Observer column on FOBTs. So, this week, I've done a Q &amp; A. https://t.co/GwbVQ2V8qU
@CalBritEsq I'm afraid, on our quiz, it's all about "technically"...
@deathfistkilla Thanks very much
@jdh561 Ha! Look forward to carousing.
@Hibbycol @RJDonachy @ishikawadan @OnlyConnectQuiz Yes, for the purposes of the question we weren't counting titles as surnames.
@Jonty_Beard @TinkyDoodah To be fair, when I went on the Sport Relief Bake-Off I put vodka in the muffins. THEY WERE DELICIOUS.
@marijeangordon I generally just use my own accent for proper names - same way I'd say "Paris" rather than "Par-eee" as its residents would.
@Puddle575 I can't promise I won't.
@Wonderlight1 Almost certainly. His twelve fingers are in every pie.
@ptessabee @OnlyConnectQuiz Good work all round.
@stevie_huge Very cool of you to man up there! Thankyou; ACCEPTED.
@daisygoodwinuk At the risk of sounding like an utter wanker, surely Palmerston's *surname* was Temple... I know I know, I despise me too.
@Jonty_Beard Not officially. But I say, SLOSH IT IN.
@collgwynfa I know, but I tend to put proper names into my own accent. You should see the letters I get when Don Quixote comes up.
@TwtrMinstrel No, you've got cleverer.
@PenguinUKBooks @BBCBooks Excellent. On duty at 9:45pm, I APPROVE. All sorted now though, thanks very much!
@owl1867 @OnlyConnectQuiz Yes, that will always help. Especially if you take it upon yourself to do the scoring.
@Daniel190597 @TonyIMoore @quizquizquiz agrees with you. I say it's amazing enough they let us miss out vowels on the cover. LET'S NOT GO MAD.
@Linked2Memories @Quizbritain What? Are you and I married? If so, I may have committed a small faux pas...
@QuizQuizQuiz @boojess Sometimes it barely needs to be a correct answer. Sometimes correct+full reasoning still gets 0. It's all a case of how recently I've eaten.
@earthdyedred Yes, it had been a while.
Speaking of Only Connect, LOOK WHAT JUST ARRIVED! Hot off the press - due in bookshops September 7th. https://t.co/juWPZ5qt3j
@stevie_huge It was a plural. Taoiseach is the singular.
@BBCBooks @PenguinUKbooks Is there any way I can contact anyone there? Nobody's answering the phone, I have an urgent question!!
Only Connect! I remembered! It's on tonight! 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
@IanHallard *sadly puts hat in bin*
@ShopManager2 I'll be returning to the subject this Sunday, thanks very much for being in touch with your thoughts.
@ShopManager2 ..the industry and I'm glad you keep an eye on people, but I do think the norm for staff as well as punters is that it's got much worse...
@ShopManager2 ..turned miserable, with longer hours and fewer staff in shops full of angrier, sadder customers. I'm very glad there are people like you in
@ShopManager2 ..your experience is unusual. EVERY other betting shop worker who's contacted me since Sunday has talked about how a once-cheerful job has..
@ShopManager2 Hello. You sound very intelligent, reasonable and thoughtful on the issue - thanks for your series of tweets. But I must say...
@theinvisiblegor Staggering natural wonder.
This eclipse is spectacular https://t.co/1RS6lzW32v
@chrisclough @thinkingpoker Oh that's nice! Thank you very much.
@Taylor000 @leninsovercoat If this was a sitcom, I know what the next scene would look like.
@adoRED19 If it were up to me, I wouldn't ban any of them. I'd just be careful where I put them. Isn't that the idea?
@BenGoldsmith Thanks very much
@rpmarshallarts For me, it's more about whether you get any kind of experience or fun in return. Whether you're buying anything OTHER than fast, grim loss.
@johnaitken69 Well that's very nice of you, thank you.
@ConMurphySport Oh! Well please give him my love immediately!
@mrmarksteel Well then thank you xxx Edinburgh is like Vegas for me now... I dream of getting back there one day... #TenMoreYears ??
@AJ_pennypacker1 @DailyMailUK If anything, the fact that right and left are united on this makes it even more weird and wrong that nothing is done.
@joebeevers Thank you xxx
@mattzarb @forgetcape Thanks very much
@ConMurphySport I didn't know they were banned there. What a clever country it is.
@AJ_pennypacker1 That's not true, actually - I know Twitter doesn't love them, but the @DailyMailUK has done great work breaking stories/protest.
@alfaulk If you like, you can read this blog I wrote when I quit a lucrative endorsement contract in 2014: https://t.co/HqWkGFrcEY
@simonwilson2304 @Lagtard What an absolute web of sadness and ruin for both families involved.
@Morton_Pork @timalmond @cjsnowdon It came from a ministerial/Gambling Commission review, showing £1.8billion lost on FOBTs over the year. https://t.co/KJkzg3gP4L
@craigmelson Sure. Of course. And I imagine a crack pipe makes you feel AMAZING. Unfortunately...
@billyinafield @guardian Lol
@Dav_88 If you climbed out of the hole, well done and good luck and that's a brilliant achievement: every day after that is a blessing.
@mrmarksteel A friend said he thinks that's for me, but I don't like to assume.. I'd be very happy if it is! If not SCREW YOU I DON'T NEED YOUR APPROVAL.
@seanmcmanus24 ...and close at 10pm! It's hiding in plain view.
@JimGeeGB I know. I know this happens. It's heartbreaking.
@SenseiChanning @mattzarb @fairergambling The blank space troubles me. You didn't like it? Or you just pressed the wrong button?!
@PolygoniaSpec Oh, there's no consistency to that at all. I'm usually daydreaming.
@rahman_nazneen Thanks very much. I think the mini biog on your Twitter page is probably the coolest one I've ever seen.
@rickybissex If you're playing two, it can actually be £600. Not sure that distinction changes the point, I must say.
@alicemeallan Thank you, that's really kind.
@JagerbombsORtea Of course - it was quite a cheery, sociable job once (though always a bit of grumpiness). Awful, awful work now.
@DavidLammy Thanks D. I know you'll say something if you get the chance. As if you don't have enough to shout about in that place already...
@grahamjohnson1 I wish you a lot of luck. The "escape" and comfort is illusory - you'd be freer, stronger and happier without. But that's so tough, I know.
@BexHunter83 If he's staying off them and you're staying by him, then you're both amazing.
@leninsovercoat Careful.
@flybymouth Well, the argument I'm making in the article I was linking to is that they don't.
@baronmad79 Well, as I say, if you're a libertarian - if you'd also decriminalise all drug use, for example - that's a legitimate counter-argument.
@KJPoulton @iamezekiel1_14 I think it's still revivable, but needs help.
@scepticalian I am.
@Terrymisterton2 Thank you. Well done for liberating yourself.
@Lagtard Thank you!
@brandartillery Lol. Thank you.
@almostconverge Well, quite.
@Orrible_Ives I don't really understand your point. Never mind.
@FOBtie That's nice of you to say, thank you! I'd love to think it might make a difference but I don't expect it will.
@chups333 Have they? Banned online poker? I hadn't heard that. Christ, the hypocrisy.
@FacileTalk I have been a professional gambler for 15 years.
@mattpyle Looking and smiling.
Yes you're right, £300 not £500. (Although a lot of people play two machines at once.) Either way, you can do your brains quick enough. https://t.co/YfFSn8L08f
@iamezekiel1_14 It wouldn't cripple them! They'd just need to close the extra outlets they opened purely to house these new beasts.
@PeteMez Well, live casinos (and bookies) existed for many years before FOBTs. The introduction of them has put losses up by over a billion pounds.
@PJKeay @Majority_Voice2 Many sophisticated measures are in place to keep people playing. They've got it all worked out.
@Tommygun016 @Dominic_Field I wonder if you think smack should be legalised and seatbelts abolished. If so, fine, you're libertarian. If not, your logic is just wrong.
@gavmassingham Thank you very much!
@lizzyf101 Well that's a whole extra thing isn't it - the misery shop workers now have to witness, the massive escalation of anger and abuse. Awful.
@jack0512 Well done if you've escaped. I could get sick on them very very easily. I played one last week "for research" and was itchy for hours.
@Jedihamster Yes but they do use them. And public money is being wasted not made. I'm talking about the government's economic argument, not the bookies.
@Majority_Voice2 Thank you - but that's not what I'm saying. It isn't about responsibility, I'm talking about the false idea that "we" make money from it.
@Mikephird I don't blame bookmakers for making profits either.
@SenseiChanning Happy Sunday x https://t.co/wdeQ16eEdA
There's a bit of swearing in my Observer column today. I don't usually do that. But I was very angry. https://t.co/wdeQ16eEdA
@BozzerHogshead It's never been right.
@OneClairePrice Excellent. The first of many! Xxx
@RevRichardColes Ooh yes
@philburns Regularly. It's their excuse for a drink.
@lopsock Well played!
@OneClairePrice Hope everything was all nice and calm xx
@jondrytay It is! [was]! Thank you xxx
@jeckythump @OnlyConnectQuiz Good luck!
@darrenjf7 @OnlyConnectQuiz It is if you like tequila.
@cgma_ciara Thanks very much!
@RevRichardColes Thank you! Very excited about your new adventure 💃💃💃
Oh lord. I forgot again, didn't I? In my defence, it *was* my birthday. #OnlyConnect
@KirbyPurple Thanks very much!
@Daily_Clerihew Yes, I'm sorry about the Mitchell bit - I was hard enough to rhyme already...
@lauradavies24 Interesting. I wonder what he'll make of my Observer column this Sunday... #responsiblegambling
@bigdogpckt5s Have a look at my website, that'll tell you!
How quickly they forget... https://t.co/RXlmYSqlk0
@Hyden_E What doesn't?
This programme sounds absolutely amazing. Where can I get a copy?  https://t.co/6xPFZSk2WI
@MrShaneReaction You can't. You can't imagine it.
@ElizaMow @GeraintThomas86 Unknowable.
@ChrisArulrajah That's absolutely wonderful to read!
@Oc7ober THEY'RE VERY GOOD.
@paulstanworth New? New? I can barely see it through the cobwebs.
@Oc7ober It's worth waiting for, I promise.
@GazeOfTheAbyss Luckily, that's 90% of the questions.
@The_Strovinator You drank more.
@GeraintThomas86 RIGHTLY
@SenseiChanning These days, they probably do
@SenseiChanning Oh you can tweet but you can't text eh, WHAT AN UNUSUAL FINGER CONDITION x
@im_patman_ Quit while you're ahead!
@JonandRoGilbert @danielpeake @caffeinemonkey Yes, that was an excellent question.
@DavidJBodycombe @danielpeake I NEVER FORGET *waves, with what now seems like meagre number of fingers*
@VanessaSelbst Aw thank you.... have a great Barcelona! Wish I was there... see you somewhere soon x
@eleonorasfalcon Language!
@MrShaneReaction I can't think of a more appropriate state for watching it.
@QuizQuizQuiz @gunsmgee And he's long forgotten.
@EmmaGarfit You're not kidding. That and the colours of the rainbow.
@danielpeake Yeah, but it's like dog years. Happy 63rd.
@becc_ys Ask @Onlyconnectquiz - quick, before you sober up
@GoBrophie I'm embarrassed for them. But then, I always am.
@tjwtyler @OnlyConnectQuiz TWO anniversaries! @myorangecrush and her husband tell me it's their 10th. So glad you all know how to spend it...
@Jonty_Beard Ooooooohhhhh @QuizQuizQuiz
@Zander1967 @vikramvasu Haha! I hope ALL our contestants are unnerving. This isn't for your bog-standard everyday numpties.
@LordRorthorn @alanmcguinn TRY HARDER
@Tea_Faerie It should be banned.
@myorangecrush @OnlyConnectQuiz @Doctor_Potts HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
@Boringscience I did love that one.
@life_academic Nothing interrupts Tuesdays.
@HKDalgsson Sorry! Sshhhh...
Well at least I got to week three before I forgot... Only Connect! Starting ten minutes ago on BBC Two!
@jacquiS21 @SlowSlownews Well, in a way...
@utahan15 Chesney Hawks.
@ThomasJohnMurch Ooh, I like the sound of that.
@gilescoren @HenryDimbleby Stop it! Is this your first day on Twitter? People will think that's REAL and it ACTUALLY HAPPENS! #pukkaleftwing
Or has someone in casting just looked at the plot and gone, "Trust me here guys. I don't know why but two names are really coming to mind."
I'm sure Maudie is a great film, but I'm troubled that Ethan Hawke is playing a hawker opposite Sally Hawkins. Is this the result of a bet?
@SteveBread @OnlyConnectQuiz Is it One Direction?
@HenryDimbleby @gilescoren Coming men? At our age? We look like two of the Rolling Stones and we haven't even done Strictly.
@Gwyrdd_Dyn @gilescoren Hurrah!
@gilescoren How did I get dragged into that? I'm just doing the same strange quiz I've been doing for nine years! "Rise of the Corens", marvellous...
@low_low I think maybe they say it differently outside Wales? BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THEM? 🌼🌼🌼
@Gary_Orford I hope it was at least during last week's episode.
They used to be better. https://t.co/VuhiHSkG4X
@HanElske @YouHadOneJ0B Magnificent.
This is just so lovely and kind and inspiring. This is what the world should be like!  https://t.co/Sdtv6h9vUt
@AntiProfessor !! FYI I wrote that five years ago..
@Bonairebondy @OnlyConnectQuiz I don't remember the question! So that's one for @QuizQuizQuiz ...
@barry_reynolds1 Lol
@ian262 I know what you mean. But we still have a fair few.
@Jay_Pee_Dunlop I enjoyed the capitals! I find his writing voice very likeable and memorable, and quite funny.
@Geoff_McGivern @jones123456789 Thankyou! *I reply nervously*. It's like alcoholism: all I can say is, I haven't smoked for two years and I intend not to smoke today...
@jones123456789 At the moment I'm not a smoker. And don't believe in ecigs/patches etc - I'm a devotee of Allen Carr's method, viz: we don't need any of it.
My Observer column today is STARING IN THROUGH YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW. Honestly, stop doing that. https://t.co/cukgCLGJr5
@ClaireMcThatter It really is high time we did a dog special. Don't quote me out of context.
@_wyn_wyn Sounds like it.
@JimJamGin @OnlyConnectQuiz We're back to Mondays in January!
@budgetjett You're too kind!
@uberlily ALWAYS PROUD.
@OriginalBigBri I bring my own vodka.
@monkeyshed It IS confusing. Wikipedia spells it (the chimp's name) Cheeta. But I think it was spelt Cheetah. Maybe it had variants, like Shakespeare.
@Soulstorm99 @HanElske POST A VIDEO
@Sidtheswan Nope. YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.
@CharlesVerrier There is an audience. They're all insensible with liquor.
@suzieee Worry not, no spoiler fears! You could just as well read that piece before the programme as after. We are back to Mondays in January!
@Irishcol66 Welcome back.
@lowriann66 And what better way to celebrate? Thank you for coming!
@emerspoon I honestly don't know. But probably?
@nlodge67 I don't know, can you...?
@Soulstorm99 It's an original score! By @dawsonsabatini
@iainjclark ACCEPTED GRATEFULLY.
If you watched tonight's Only Connect and are sceptical about my Cheetah claim: look, LOOK! Dates and everything! https://t.co/4ttqw8g8MD
@Esperera_Jones IT CAN'T LAST
@Crazylegsuk Well, quite.
@raymierussell It'll wear off.
@petermadden That is chosen much more often than water.
Enjoying the holidays? Well, snap out of it: Only Connect is on tonight. BBC Two, 8.30pm.
@fabuloushoes Yes. Everyone gets "free" stuff - it's only a case of how much...
@PaulDiamond3 @gilescoren The Rat &amp; Cockle was very much a "mind palace", I think. And there was always a man at the bar in a QPR scarf.
@oldmansteptoe @fabuloushoes Thanks for noticing 😎😎😎
@RuAzev Thank you! I'm sorry it had been so long...
@FinH69 Lovely.
@slythowlet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really? I mean, classy.
@fabuloushoes Ohhhh yes, I certainly have.
@yermoungder There are quite a few now! The groundbreaker, surely: majestic Anne Robinson.
@mellotronworker The squid that swam around the boats?
@PaulPfj Excellent reference
This display in a high street cinema, I think, really brings home the poignancy and scale of the events. https://t.co/ocpGsK86Gw
@Synthon61 I'm not sure, it does sometimes seem like that doesn't it? Pure shame, maybe.
@pluskavec It's all from love!
@PeterLyster @WordsAboutBooks I DIDN'T TOUCH THE SHOES
@DeltaNC Well you can certainly READ about it. https://t.co/5hpp18hBLn
@sodapops41 Hurray, there's no reaction I like more.
@alstewitn Oh that's nice! Thank you very much.
@RichNick73 Thank God for the limited word count ;-)
A blow-up doll, a robot and a professor go into a bar. Which is sexiest? Let's have a mass debate! https://t.co/PXWppsXbzZ
@LeePMarshall @SaRAWRcool Mmmm
@TuiteDaniel @OnlyConnectQuiz Thanks very much!
@firewasp TIME TO APPLY TO BE ON THE SHOW!
@asifkjc @Trudi_Rose After all, it's like football in so many other ways.
@jamesianosborne @Trudi_Rose Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.
@kingjim1982 Really? You should be thinking about applying for the next series...
@MattBecker82 @erlinggarriock @FJMScott Yes.
Ooh, if we could only have it moved to South Wales. https://t.co/15Hxk0fjD9
@mrapps It'll certainly seem long.
@sampie_pants @beckiharding94 Happy birthday!
@Lotty_8 @OnlyConnectQuiz Oh we'll find something............. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.
@1969jdr Of course they're true! Of COURSE.
@Lawreate Ooh, nice rhyme.
@UngleMaa THAT'S THE NICEST COMPLIMENT EVER! I was just writing about Humphrey Lyttelton today, in a SECRET BOOK I CAN'T TALK ABOUT YET.
@ShrnThomson That sounds like a really great Friday night. (Apart from the Only Connect bit.)
@bigcheeser Thanks very much!
@RyPamplemousse @beepersprout @OnlyConnectQuiz Speak for yourself. I have NEVER had a dull evening in Bournemouth.
@miaseven Heavens, no.
@erlinggarriock @FJMScott I think an oversight, but we would have had to accept Nine, of course. Good spot.
@jjman920 Imagine how I feel.
@Irishcol66 Well played! Don't worry, that's just to lull you into a false sense of security for greater misery and self-loathing later in the series.
@P_K_Tips January!
@Viola_Bosun I ACCEPT
@Trudi_Rose I'm used to it.
@merimaat Not at all.
@The_Strovinator BON APPETIT
@Daxyla I can only apologise. We are basically there to sap the joy from people's lives.
@RossMc11 @OnlyConnectQuiz Ooh, good journey.
@bigmc375 @sawdoctors Congratulations! That is very much an achievement.
@AndyMcH Thank you!
@FJMScott I wasn't watching.. what was the category?
@frogplate Excellent tweet.
@WiresFeatherBoa Well, quite.
@kfindlay Race home, grab remote, feet in a mustard bath, READY.
@g_rosser One of my favourite sorts of people!
@PhilJonesSirFon Yes of course!
New series starts at 8.30pm on BBC Two, hope you enjoy it, it's lovely to be back. #OnlyConnect
Biggest news of the night: I think Only Connect is on tonight in Wales AT THE SAME TIME AS EVERYWHERE ELSE! Hwre!
@dragonlovingLFC xxx
@helen__phillips Ohhhh you must miss him terribly. Let's just say that the teams may not take your mind off cubs entirely.... but let us distract you anyway.
@captainbeaky IT'S ALL A DRINKING GAME
@Stevec4117 @Soulstorm99 If they're anything like my family, I'm very sympathetic.
@grahamh941 @slackermanbo BON APPETIT
@TimRich91924536 I'll be exactly the same as I always am. I recommend you watch something else. There's a nice repeat of Still Open All Hours on BBC One.
@dunnsda The syllables are in the eye of the beholder.
@JubalBarca SWIVEL ROUND DOING BOTH, LIKE AN OWL
@BBCAnyQuestions @Le_ExpertPro Please. WE DON'T NEED TO BEG. Go ahead, watch Any Questions, SEE IF WE CARE.
@RaphaelSBriand GOOD PRIORITIES
THE FLAX IS TWISTING
EYE OF HORUS
@toothlessgibbon No! There's one more sleep!
@DavidMcCabe144 #sinister
@wildigital @Stapes @MexHeadroom My friend Charlie and I wanted to write a sitcom about a man called Mike Egyptian who had an artefacts shop.
@erichindle That one I like.
@jamadu76 @Stapes @MexHeadroom On him being a what?
@Stapes @MexHeadroom they made up his name. So why Brittas? It might just as well have been British. Gordon British. Might as bloody well.
@Stapes @MexHeadroom Did you ever see the sitcom "The Brittas Empire" ? It was about a man called Gordon Brittas. The title was a pun on British Empire. But...
@Stapes Is that a thing? INFURIATING.
@BDO_New_Energy Really? Does it? That's absurd.
@mazgasko @Daniel190597 @CapitanoPimPim I mean, quite. WHICH IS IT? If you can't be sure, it doesn't work.
@MonicaSpoor An intriguing prospect.
@grahamh941 That would have been better.
Gah, this is like Oat So Simple all over again.
People are saying it's a pun on "lands of plenty". But that's not a phrase! Land of plenty, maybe.
This is an annoying headline. Why not Lanza-LOTTY? https://t.co/fxINpUaKyG
@squelchuk Well played!
@frustrated_slug And yet so many wear hats.
@MarkApRodger Is it? I don't know. To bamboozle children, maybe.
@danro_art Ha! It's a curse that would seem very effective. I ignore 85% of tweets through sheer inability to understand how or where to see them.
@thewarrenhouse @RealDMitchell I wasn't asleep.
@ZeeBCrew @AlanSharpComedy "Beseech" is a very good word.
@ian262 Next year! It goes back next year!
@too_teddy Very gallant of him to look horrified rather than delighted.
@DramaturgPc That really made me laugh.
@hurricanehorton TRUE
@gm_eleanor !!! I bet the driver was delighted.
@chrisphin @stoneflowerjane That's very sweet
@brodders_be Lol
Some magnificent responses this morning to my uncool motherhood/casino anecdote from last night. Favourites to follow.
@HKW1981 Magnificent
@jenziew That's an amazing anecdote.
@Omilburn Depends whose they were I guess. Nice to keep active.
@AlanSharpComedy Awww
@Geoff_McGivern I wish they did!
@Savage_Vince Excellent
@MoiraSinclair1 @exitthelemming That's brilliant
@GetItQuietly IT'S CRUNCH TIME.
I HAVE AN EPT TOURNAMENT RECORD THAT WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. Now there is nothing but yawns, grease and a trail of tiny snacks wherever I go.
The young chap next to me asks, "What is Mr Noisy?". I'm like, "You'll find out."
Motherhood = playing your first Vic cash game in months, reaching for your wallet and pulling out a packet of tiny breadsticks and Mr Noisy.
@Baddiel There's something I really love about the "Whereas". Very History Today.
@Pseudorandom71 @Andyjryder No no, I've played duplicate many times! That was just an especially memorable one ☺️
@NeilClarke1975 Aw
@TimelordMr I'm a gambler
@keiththecamel Oh yes he is, that would be a nice story
@keiththecamel Oh, is he having a good run? I'm glad, I really like Kenny Hallaert. Very nice guy.
@jordandias THAT'S THE SPIRIT
@Esperera_Jones I know, I KNOW. Our ENTIRE CREW is in Wales. They will be reunited with the opportunity to watch the show at a regular time in January!
@v8aholic @RealDMitchell I mean, WHAT a Christmas special.
@Philippa_Perry No no - I shall be mating with an American on Dover beach. That is CLEARLY the message.
@DaveCurran99 Ooh, nice gif
@jamesianosborne You won't be disappointed.
@hathcrow Ha! 2008.
@PygmyLoris You sound like our kind of viewer. HELLO AGAIN.
@ajlarge Well, what time have you scheduled the traditional "first quiz" ?
We're on Fridays at 8.30 (in England and Scotland; Wales &amp; NI may vary) until Christmas, then back to Mondays in the New Year. https://t.co/B05nPdI7Aq
Yes, the THIRTEENTH series of Only Connect starts on Friday July 28th, 8.30pm on BBC2. Lovely to see such a drumroll around the new series. https://t.co/iwE3tT7BaJ
@sallyjwatson We were JUST discussing that! It's basically this all over again  https://t.co/DVEgwCH5DX
@manlyartichokes @BritishComedy @RealDMitchell @iamjohnoliver @worldofdes @RichardAyoade Indistinguishable
@keiththecamel IT'S 110 DEGREES! How, HOW?!
@xanabe Good luck! It's an amazing adventure.
@radiocode I will soon.
@keiththecamel How did you DO that with J at this age? I feel a genuine awe about that now.
@ElizaMow I shouldn't wonder.
@SenseiChanning Anyway, I'm going to sleep. Glgl, have a great time, take me with you next time ffs xx
@Dark_God @RealDMitchell Well.. it's not something *I* find difficult to imagine.
@SenseiChanning What does the weekend hold? Secret Gardens and Mon Ami Gabi I bet. Aarrgghh!!!
@SenseiChanning GIQ. It was your tweets that STARTED this wistful train of thought.
But don't get me wrong, the new life is great! GN, GL in Vegas.
1.30am in London: husband asleep, baby asleep and I feel such an itch for the Amazon room. The old life whispering from across the Atlantic.
It's so weird, feels like the WSOP is happening in a parallel universe. I'll be back there one day! Maybe next year...
@ebeewrites WHAT MAGNIFICENT SHOES
@MulberryCoates Oh yes. That's what the casino floor is for.
@glorafin @OnlyConnectQuiz July 28th start! Fridays at 8.30 in England and Scotland, Wales &amp; NI might be a bit upside down, back to normal Mondays in January.
@OllieMont Nope, I'm on the wrong side of the Atlantic.
@Esperera_Jones You're preaching to the converted there. Every episode for months of the last series got two separate tweets from me, zzz.
@Adam__Furness @jrawson About 15 years. It's good to live in hope.
@phil_grimwade @theJeremyVine Lol
@jabbso @woodg31 Ha! That was a long time ago.
@NeilClarke1975 ALL HEROES
@jonnyhaldane I have played it, three or four times. I'll play it again one day.
@CRiedlinger77 I look forward to meeting him on the show in 13 years' time!
@snookerfanatic Like a brightly wrapped box of coal.
@jimgrim747 A unicorn.
@MarkBensonMark Quite an ascetic form of binging, but go for it.
@JohnnyDuthie Sadly, the resemblance doesn't end there.
OC starts 28th July! (That's a Friday, moving back to Mondays in 2018) https://t.co/YMM9NkNoOP
@Quickblood It will! We're recording it now.
@michaelegan76 That's very nice of you to say.
@kwhitestone Have a nice evening!
@kimmorganuk Also, it eats nothing but strawberries. Picky picky.
@Rach_the_Pach Thanks very much!
@Everytimeref Yum
@Everytimeref Truth is, I like it when men open jars. (a) it's sexy and (b) I'm then closer to the jam.
@TheMattBarker @ebroglio8 Or "I think the greatest player in the world is Roger Federer." Or whoever he thinks. No need for the imaginary 700-person direct contest!
@exitthelemming @joonloons Ah.. no, that's already unticked. Sadly, I think it just has a mind of its own.
@BoneyMem Well if so, he phrased it really badly to sound like the opposite! But I think he's just happy to have some controversy around his new book.
@StuartBJBSmith Oh you must try not to be so upset and cross. I'm sorry if you've had bad experiences but it's never too late to hope for better. Good luck.
@OrangSoul Lol. And they REALLY MIND! It really upsets them to see the logic dissected a bit! Like it MATTERS TERRIBLY!
@FrancisWheen @normanovwingate Bottoms up!
@joonloons @exitthelemming I'll have a look! It didn't offer that option before...
@WhatTheBearSays What can I tell you? That's what newspaper columns are. Luckily, they're easily avoided for those who don't enjoy them!
@InThruTheWindow FOREVER UNCHALLENGED!
@RealJamesBoston Hurray! Thanks very much.
@Terminus_Stop @DT_NerdyGeek He'd be faster than some and slower than others, wouldn't he? But we might not bother holding the imaginary race.
@Terminus_Stop @DT_NerdyGeek I wouldn't bother speculating. Where would you put Usain Bolt v dogs? In speed terms? 8000th? 8,000,000th? 10th?
@danTHFCuk @VivGroskop Yes, it takes some effort.
@StuartBJBSmith There's something sort of beautiful about the knot you've got yourself tied in there.
@ScurrilousMay Thank you! Xx
@SaintBiffy @HAYLEYBARRETT5 I know; good old McEnroe, never old enough to know better.
@bulltwittingman Quite. Very much the point I was trying to make.
@lauradavies24 @RogerDavies24 That's my kind of package.
@timt501 It's just science.
@HAYLEYBARRETT5 @SaintBiffy Not necessarily a stupid question, it's quite a cunning question. It was a trap and he fell right into it. So many other, better answers.
@MartinJohnFrost Yours sounds excellent.
@Everytimeref PROVE IT!!!
@Richshaugh Well it's a delight to see some people who grasped the meaning of it! Thankyou
@exitthelemming How? HOW?!
Anyway chaps, as I said about McEnroe and certain poker players: if it makes you that happy to say it, then enjoy yourselves! I'm off out.
So many men on my timeline eager to shriek that women are worse at tennis than men! I almost wish for them that tennis was more important.
@DT_NerdyGeek @RealDMitchell Well, as I've said in my article, I think this is missing the point.
@YeomansJohn Oh yes. Almost everything is.
@reynolj He can say whatever he likes in response to whatever he likes! And now I've said something in response! It's all very healthy.
@SpacemanSpiffo Well, we're all constrained by our biology, aren't we? That's not a peculiarly female thing.
@jayuu47 Observer articles appear on the Guardian website. I'm not sure why they can't have both names on those pages, but they seem not to!
@exitthelemming !!! Only just seen this. Twitter lists things oddly now so I only see half my messages. It's brilliant. Yes, excellent &amp; pithy lit crit.
@F1Bert86 It's actually the other way round. I was very amused by his comment, and he isn't right.
@londonkro @guardian Lol. I accept that final score.
@thfc_cockerel @guardian Is it? It's not a section I see much of!
I see @guardian have listed it under "sport". I would say it's not sport, it's opinion as usual! But I never understand these things.
In today's Observer, I'm discussing the various ways in which John McEnroe is talking balls. https://t.co/09JGZ7grok
@tangaer Thanks very much! Have a lovely weekend - not too much rice.
@bluepepperaudio @4oD I'm afraid I have no idea! I never understand that stuff.
@_DanSchofield What a lovely thing to say, thank you.
@_wyn_wyn Thanks very much!
They look like nice guys. https://t.co/DYt1C830ew
@SilverFoxZone NICE CLOCK!
@normanovwingate No no, it's back on July 28th
@Oh_My_Croft Very
@keiththecamel I can only hope he tuned in halfway through
@InThruTheWindow @ThePokerRoomUK BON APPE-TEA
@JJOBuse I take my own.
(Jimmy Carr, Jon Richardson, Jonathan Ross, Lee Mack and Jessie Cave being funny while I obsessively add, subtract, spell and mutter.)
It was my childhood dream to go on Countdown but I'd never be good enough. Hurray for "Cats Does Countdown" (tonight at 9 on Channel 4) !
@dancinteddie @theMsJDH @OnlyConnectQuiz No, the tournament structure is incomprehensible. But I know there are 37 episodes.
@theMsJDH @OnlyConnectQuiz I must tell you it'll still be on Fridays for the first six months.. moves to Mondays in January
@4randomwords @PhilRacing 28th, I think!
@Jonfromncl That's really lovely to hear, thank you
@brightaliking Well that's a very nice thing to say, thank you
@Rev_BJohnson A VISION
@LauraGaribbo Hmm. There's something about that I like.
@alfaulk That one you can get away with.
@sonnlich @grahamh941 Yes I agree - I think the form may be to not have vinegar at at all, but I (surely the arbiter of style?) would always go Sarsons then salt.
@Owls2k Lol

@LutonGentPoker @helenalankey Excellent.
@DJay6000 Thank you!
@Snugglyduvet @DarrenHurley07 I'm afraid it will be on Fridays. BUT it will be moving to Mondays in the new year.
@DarrenHurley07 I think it's at the end of July.
@Jax_Hooker I'M GOING TO BUY ONE
@Hookawoolly Honestly, I really shouldn't bother if I were you.
@miblo_ @OnlyConnectQuiz I don't even understand the tweet, never mind the rest of it!
@king_geo333 @emmadentcoad She specifically talks about her involvement with the council before she was an MP!
Well done and good luck, @emmadentcoad. I think maybe nothing matters except this.  https://t.co/5ADLhuqSsS
@NaomiLWood I don't know, but I certainly haven't heard of one...
@NaomiLWood No need to apologise! Not your fault and I'm pretty indifferent to trolls. High trollerance, as it were.
@rewboss @ConnorBhoy1995 It was just a present. I've had worse presents.
@khimjiano Always good to have something to look forward to... ;-)
@The_Strovinator That's great.
@everdundas Excellent.
@janeskinner2 I don't know if I'd find it so exciting if it was ceramic.
@ConnorBhoy1995 Well that's good and quirky.
@nwnman Oh thank you! It was a lovely audience.
@Glengirly Why choose? Go at low tide!
@jonathanhope Happy Sunday to you too
@oldnicodemus @DavidWoodhead26 Ah yes, now I see what he thought he meant. But there is no other link. I'd have been "looking" for years...
@mermhart Penguins were on my long list! Not falling over but racing eagerly towards water and then stopping, suddenly nervous, on the edge.
@oldnicodemus @DavidWoodhead26 I know! It was his OP that didn't make sense. My tweets weren't contradictory.
@FreddietheFoxHx No it didn't.
@hederaLC Enjoy them quickly! They're in trouble.
@DavidWoodhead26 @oldnicodemus Is it? I don't quite understand what it means. What did I write that I should have read?
@Sylvia_Davies @skomer_island @WTSWW @mermhart MAGNIFICENT.
@RuralGurn That's really lovely.
@McLuckieJames That's very nice to hear, thank you
@snathe BEAUTIFUL
@ms_molly_vog Straight in at number 3.
@rawktacular @Nigella_Lawson You haven't tried my schnitzel.
@brightaliking It's a very good way to spend the day! (Making your own list, OR a duvet on the sofa...)
