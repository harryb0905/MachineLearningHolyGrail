@CoLBBSC hi ! I’m trying to identify some mushrooms I saw down at Burnham Beeches the other day... Can you help? https://t.co/Tw2bDWWjwG
what's the best email service provider to use ????? so over gmail
@seggan It should get to you soon!!!
@Nutristrength Oh I’d love to try! Thank you!
@Mialovescurry Also cooking with herbs &amp; spices. smoked paprika ! Bay leaves ... chili! All kinds of hot sauces. Garlic...chipotle....turmeric...ginger....mmmm. If you make smoothies get a vegan protein like pea protein to add for an extra boost  xxx
@Mialovescurry Oh also a lot of nuts/seeds/granola/oats! chickpeas are a great source of protein. I mix up my pasta, like I’ll get spelt, then brown rice, then chick pea pasta to make sure I’m having variety. Falafel obvs. Hummus a staple....beans! Damn I’m hungry now.
@Mialovescurry I think making sure you’re getting a good variety of colour on your plate is super important. And the more you learn about it he more you get into it. I hope any of this helps!! Maybe I should do a lil live post about this
@Mialovescurry And Vietnamese I eat a lot of too. Make sure you get a good b12 and multivitamin too. I was a bit scared of missing cheese but then cheese is actually addictive so once you get rid of that craving it really goes.
@Mialovescurry I switch between almond/coconut/oat &amp; hazelnut milk because I like to mix it up. I also just got into baking, making something like banana bread is so easy and a great breakfast/mid morning/afternoon snack. I could literally eat it all day. Curries are amazing for vegan diet
@Mialovescurry Quinoa/rice/some kind of grain you like, and then I use a lot of tahini &amp; tobasco on my food. Or you can do the same with pasta, roast the veg and then make a Passata sauce, tomato, basil, salt &amp; pepper. These are 2 really was meals I eat ALL THE TIME!
@Mialovescurry My absolute favourite thing to cook is veggie bowls, so I just pick a different Flavour or cuisine and adapt it to that. I usually roast a bunch of veg, like sweet potato, greens of choice, i love kale &amp; courgette,  tomatoes, mushrooms, cauliflower, broccoli... and then choose
@Mialovescurry Yes! so my first few months we’re bit difficult because it was a switch of mindset, getting used to checking the ingredients of things &amp; also really learning how to cook &amp; getting everything I need. I can recommend oh she glows for recipes ! https://t.co/CB2Fpv0qDe
And shit if you still eat meat, sort your life out mate.
If you’re interested in going vegan then pls tweet me. I can give you tips, it’s actually not that hard a transition from vegetarian to vegan, everyone’s like ‘but cheese’ but I haven’t missed it once. I feel healthier &amp; stronger than ever as well.
We’re such a weird, disconnected, ego maniac species sometimes.
Literally can’t deal w humans. It’s so disillusioned to think that this is humane, perhaps it makes the person killing the lobster feel better?Hands up if you would feel more chill about getting sliced in half or boiled to death if you were high? #govegan 🌱 https://t.co/yjSJS45Ujn

@No1LilyAllenFan I love you
It will all have been sent out by the end of August which is great! And I’m starting to see people’s pledges arrive which makes me so happy! 🐶😊 Srsly love you and am workin our arses off no doubt 🧗‍♀️🧗🏻‍♂️
We had a problem with the vinyl that slowed us down and I really wanted to make the actual product good quality! So that was my priority, making sure what you get is 💯 I love you guys and can’t thank you enough for your patience. We’re working on it everyday this month!
Not gonna lie it’s frustrating for me too, I had def wanted to have everything out by now, truth is we initally had more help and I have to keep working alongside so I’m not always available to be there to post the packages &amp; then it’s just Joey!
We’re doing everything we can to get everything out to you as quickly as possible! It’s quite a complicated system and we’re working hard on it, just the 2 of us &amp; my sister is joining us next wk to help.
Anyone that has any questions regarding kickstarter orders please email KateNashKickstarter@gmail.com ✨ We’re doing our best to get everything out as fast as we can! Thanks for your patience!
@_hayleyhbomb Hey yes! Email KateNashKickstarter@gmail.com We’re doing our best to get everything out as soon as we can! X
@sarah1986 Wow. Fucking insane. You’re powerful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
@Shananigans Thank you for sharing this 💘💘💘💘💘
@caseygwilliam 💘💘💘💘💘 I believe in you and you’re beautiful so 🤷‍♀️
@OldFlameRecords 💘💘💘
Spend time on those who love you, who elevate you, who make you feel positive. And don’t waste time on trying to please the ones that don’t. K bye! 🧚🏻‍♀️🐕 https://t.co/wJ0WiX4CGL
I always loved these replacements lyrics “The ones, love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest And visit their graves on holidays at best The ones, love us least are the ones we'll die to please If it's any consolation, I don't begin to understand them”
Look yourself in the mirror everyday and tell yourself you’re a badass bitch from hell and no one can fuck with you. Then don’t let anybody fuck with you. Be loud &amp; proud. Love to my haters 🤣❤️😂
I hope sharing this helps anyone who has been or is currently being bullied. Bullies &amp; negativity do not define you, they can influence you &amp; you can turn that bad stuff into drive, ambition &amp; a force for yourself. 🙏‼️ Have a beautiful day &amp; always remember to...
I’ve had Twitter hate campaigns started against me. Instead of getting caught up in that, I use the internet to try and spread positivity and self confidence. We can have control of what we engage in. Surround yourself with positivity as much as possible! 🧚🏻‍♀️💘✨
Words are very powerful and they can hurt us, but the words we use on ourselves can be the harshest and most damaging. I look in the mirror everyday and force myself to like and love myself. We have to re train our brains.
I made a zine about all the worst things that have been said about me online &amp; have pretty much made it my number one agenda to stand up for the outsiders, freaky people, those of us that don’t fit in and to empower girls as much as possible. Warts n all we are beautiful 💪
I’ve been bullied by the media, called fat and ‘too ugly to be a pop star’. I’ve also received death/rape threats online. I’ve been called a stale sip of beer &amp; everything that’s wrong with music distilled into one slag 🤷‍♀️
I absolutely nailed my final performance so shout out to all the girls that locked me in the cupboard for the inspiration to push myself
I sat in there and thought ‘I’m gonna be the best actress in the year, I’m gonna work my arse off and do really well &amp; I don’t need to succumb to this bullshit’ I actually felt really calm and just though situation was dumb.
I really remember being locked in a cupboard at school and a bunch of girls laughing on the other side of the door ensuring I would be late to an after school club I really wanted to go to.
It’s an anti-bullying kind of day. Share your personal experiences with bullying to help show the negative impact it can have on your self esteem &amp; share how you overcame this to show that we can persevere 🙌
@aisfornala They’re all being sent out this wk or next! 🙏 https://t.co/KA6S0zAbHy

Recording a new song today ✨ https://t.co/y14H43h6NP
I watched a lot about how these apps we’re addicted to are designed and created by the people that create slot machines in Vegas. I was so shocked to hear it but kind of relieved to know it has been designed this way and that I have a choice to take control of my usage
2. Phones banned from the dinner table! It made me sad how normalized that is when I actually think it is so rude. And having a rule has been surprisingly easy to implement ✨
Here’s my new rules i implemented this wk! 1. Phones banned from the bedroom! I got an alarm clock and it is amazing not to have my phone be the first thing I see when i wake up and last thing I see before sleeping!
Anyone wanna talk about how addicted they are to their phone and what they are doing to implement changes? I think we need to help each other get off our phones 📱

This shit doesn’t even seem real anymore https://t.co/AThsj6r89v
@RICKERSRG And secondly I think letting things slip for so long &amp; refusing to learn and grow is how we have gotten to this point. Anyway I hope we can progress from this &amp; I hope you can consider these points
@RICKERSRG I actually think the opposite. Firstly I do believe this is a big deal...Alan Sugar is the 95th richest person in the UK, classed as a lord. He is a powerful person and not holding people in positions of power accountable is dangerous
@RICKERSRG Yes that is true! As a white woman I do have to check my privilege!! And learn and grow from &amp; apologize for my mistakes when I make them.
We are all mere mortals &amp; make the mistake of pre judging/stereotyping peope on a daily basis. But there is a line, there has to be. There’s children in fucking cages right now because of racism. So let’s raise the bar &amp; change our dumb brains.
And @RICKERSRG I genuinely hope you can come to see this important difference &amp; help us move forward. We must call a spade a spade, or a racist joke a racist joke! And hold people in positions of power accountable for their blindness &amp; ignorance
If @RICKERSRG we insert “ALAN SUGAR’S JOKE HERE” we have a different scenario. A racist joke. So very blatantly. This is not about us having a difference of opinion. It was a racist joke. An example of harmful &amp; offensive “stereotyping” aka racism.
Of course @RICKERSRG we know not ALL Irish people are friendly but when we go there we have such positive interactions, we generalise! I could agree with you there is no harm done from all stereotypes. HOWEVER...
Secondly @RICKERSRG There is a difference between non hurtful stereotypes and racism. For example you could say, “Irish people are so friendly” Not 100% fact, but stereotype by definition “a widely held, oversimplified idea of a person/thing/place”
Ok. Let’s break this down...for the sake of growth &amp; change not because I can be bothered. Firstly it’s important you learn &amp; recognize it’s absolutely not your place as a white man to tell people of colour that they ‘took’ something racist the wrong way. https://t.co/xO5yq9SRCi
Kill the Patriarchy 🔪❤️ https://t.co/rnR7ea2oGV
Thank youuuu!!! https://t.co/Q7dhb42cay
No. Denied. the issue is racism. https://t.co/NyMpE4c4Wa
I agree with @DawnButlerBrent re #AlanSugar Move over racist, out of touch men. Give space to diversity! Give space to good people. Hold those in power responsible &amp; accountable for their actions. Time is up on this old fashioned &amp; offensive behaviour
I’ve been in an emotionally abusive relationship before &amp; wish I could have known how to spot the signs earlier &amp; leave sooner! Never worth it to stay with someone who makes you unhappy. You are worth so much more than being with an abuser 💘💖💘 https://t.co/IluXK0TwH2
@AVIDdetention hello, I’d love to talk to you, if you could DM me thank you

Honestly I’m sort of speechless &amp; my words feel jumbled up. But I’ll post the copy of my letters so you can copy &amp; paste. Please send letters &amp; emails expressing your horror to the companies involved... General Dynamics, MVM, GeoGroup, TRAILBOSS inc
Currently writing letters &amp; emails to all the companies involved in profiting from children being torn from their parents at the border...right now...current day...and being kept in cages, yes cages...in 2018.

NEW KICKSARTER UPDATE!!
Omgomgomgomgomg
Today is #TimetoTalk day! So often we make excuses &amp; avoid talking about our feelings because we think it’s not the right time. It’s always the right time to make time for your mental health! 💕❤️
@yekim_mikey It can take so long but it’s all part of the “process” I’ve been shocked at myself before, how long I’ve kept negativity in my life but really that’s us resisting to self love
So self love pledge this month. Wanna join me?
I’ve really begun to realise how much I avoid it and how important self care and love is. I like to talk about those things but it’s different actually getting around to doing it
Which I obviously like most want to avoid. 😇😬
But! We have to do this on our own! I really recommend reading https://t.co/5knkuCYECp it helps me spend some time each month on focusing on myself
Wouldn’t it be amazing if we were taught emotional education as we grew up?
I was writing yesterday and thinking about the word ‘processing’, how much we use it, avoid it, try to do it, and the fact we are not educated about this at all during our schooling years
Thinking about ‘processing traumatic events’ during this super full blood blue super moon lunar eclipse in Leo January. How do you know when you’ve processed something?
Omg obsessed https://t.co/DiFGQHeFyU

@emmy_the_great Lol!
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews Everyone goes through dark times/bullying/being screwed over/losing. Never give up on yourself, you are way stronger than u think ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews And if you’re someone that is close to the edge/giving up on yourself then I hope you can find comfort in the knowledge that pretty much
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews I’ll happily talk to anyone about failures &amp; struggles with the industry w no shame. I’m proud of my work &amp; how I’ve handled my challenges
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews I’m very lucky and I don’t take this subject lightly as I’ve come so close to giving up on art before, which would have destroyed me.
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews But it needs to be addressed how unsupported &amp; screwed over so many musicians are. I’ve seen people’s careers destroyed by shady business.
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews I don’t know why this really effected me this morning cause I see shit like this all the time &amp; genuinely don’t care.
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews It’s ok that people aren’t in the limelight the whole time, or that things go sideways for ANYONE in ANY JOB. I just can’t stand bullying
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews There’s all this stigma that we’re not allowed to talk about struggling or failure because it’s so embarrassing. But fuck that.
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews And during a shitty time something like this could have seriously crushed me. And maybe someone else on that list is having a shitty time.
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews But I am and there have been many times over the past 10 years when I haven’t been ok. Mentally, financially, emotionally, physically.
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews Also the reason I can’t let this slide is because I happen to be in a great, happy place in my life. Which is difficult for anyone 2 achieve
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews Keep on keepin on! ☄️🔥
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews To all the other independent/smaller artists out there wearing ‘baggy jumpers &amp; DM’s’ I admire u. This sleazy industry doesn’t make it easy
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews Boy bye https://t.co/f741e8JJG0
@BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews I still exist u twat, alongside all the other artists in this list. 🖕#notdeadtillimdead
@BuzzFeed So fuck you for making fun of independent artists @BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews wow. Sorry but it’s not a joke to me.
@BuzzFeed Struggling to be able to continue and many do have to give up &amp; ‘wear baggy jumpers and DM’s’ &amp; that is sad because art fucking matters
@BuzzFeed I think is important. But not to just take the piss out of artists that got dropped or aren’t in the charts anymore. Most artists I know are
@BuzzFeed Also I have huge problems with how the industry disposed of artists, it’s a difficult career to maintain so this is actually a discussion
@BuzzFeed Politically &amp; environmentally u should really get a grip &amp; hold yourselves accountable for the positive change we all want to see @BuzzFeed
From @BuzzFeed or from any other media outlet is helpful or interesting. It could hurt unstable people &amp; with what is going on in the world
With all the talk of mental health recently &amp; the amount of mental health issues within the artist community I don’t think this contribution
Plus even if I was just wearing baggy jumpers and DM’s what is wrong with that? What do these people value? I have no idea
rude, it doesn’t reflect the truth and seems irrelevant and out of touch. The media really need to get a grip https://t.co/GXgt8XcylH
Nor. my career. I just think this media tone is actually very dangerous. The media keep telling us what the facts are. Not only is it https://t.co/GXgt8XcylH
It says a lot about what people are being told to value. But it’s v old fashioned. Plus it is not a real reflection of how millennials think https://t.co/GXgt8XcylH
The media have talked about me this way my entire career, since I was 20 years old. I think this media tone needs to end. https://t.co/GXgt8WUXu9

first time i have thought seriously about the practical dependency to our smart phones and what that means in an emergency situation. https://t.co/Nq2BP9TqKC
@HOLYCHILD our music, our library, our photos, memories, art collection
@HOLYCHILD interesting
@HOLYCHILD yeah you rely on it in an emergency situation and don't have a back up plan
@itsmybusyseason it's huge, you should be proud of it. because this stuff is designed to keep us engaged and addicted.
@fazerovocalize if we are stuck somewhere on our own and we need help we use our phone for everything
@fazerovocalize and then if you are out somewhere stranded, or if you need help at an airport/in an emergency situation/proof of identity/direction,
@fazerovocalize i'll notice that i'm carrying it in my hand as i walk down the street, it's on my dinner table, in my bed. it's insane really
@fazerovocalize a phone is always on you. constant scrolling, it has an addictive nature, being handheld i'm less conscious about how much i use it.
@HOLYCHILD yesterday i was literally stuck &amp; crying without it. i felt totally helpless and so stupid. it was insane. i need to act on making changes
i'm going to attempt to write an essay on this
what is connectivity? what makes you feel connected to your friends/family/lovers? what makes you feel isolated/lonely?
another thing i notice is how much i want to say "ugh this is so dumb 2 talk about". it's not, we can't write if off as trivial anymore.
i'm going to try and implement changes to my life to make this healthier for myself &amp; also to become more independent from my smart phone
@HOLYCHILD yea it's so crazy. it's been such an interesting wk without a phone. mind blowing how much it has changed
there's pros that we should healthily be able to enjoy which is great. but for so many of us it becomes a negative and we become dependent
i'm tweeting about it because i think it is a social issue that we need to raise awareness of. but we can only make the changes ourself
i'm going to strive to use these things in a much healthier way and also to be able to rely on myself when i'm stranded or in an emergency
i think this is a serious issue too. both the social and practical problem. and you can only as an individual make changes to your routine
i agree https://t.co/zRsLX9Zo8W
but i was shocked at the practicality/necessity elements of my iphone usage that i hadn't realised were a daily thing now
so like taking a break from social media and only accessing it from my laptop felt so much healthier and monitored.
selling us on this whole 'connectivity' thing is actually bullshit. it doesn't feel good to be that connected to curated thought and imagery
and i'm talking practicality too. not just addiction to social media. because that was a huge relief.
@fatbury but it's just interesting how practically we need them too
there were moments where i was genuinely stuck without it and i hated that feeling, it felt so stupid.
can't decide if it has dumbed me down/made me lazy or if i am just going with the natural order of progression &amp; the technological evolution
it's such a simple thing, and should be a luxury not a necessity. it's made me question a lot of what has become my normal/everyday
it's really made me think and i feel like i need to implement some serious changes
there were moments where you are really stuck without it, we have put absolutely everything into these smart phones
So crazy how having an iphone is such a huge part of our lives now. i realised this wk how much we rely on them and it freaked me out.

@No1LilyAllenFan I've seen similar stats from other sources too. BUT that is so great to hear and I hope they are all wrong and the youth take over
@No1LilyAllenFan *himself
@No1LilyAllenFan Jeremy Corbyn himsel slipped into my DM's and told me this
@Greeny_original But u r registered?
@itsmybusyseason Yes exactly, unfortunately yes
Use your head and use your vote, there is nothing u could say to convince me u shouldn't be registered https://t.co/Krbcdr5ChE
@Greeny_original Fine by me. At least u did something
I can't think of other reasons u would willingly choose to take away your right to voice your opinion. It's like computer says no 2 me
If your reasons for not registering are you can't be arsed and duno how to, it takes 5 mins, all u need is ur national insurance number
If your reasons for not registering are they're all shitbags, you gotta pick the shit bag u think u can hold the most accountable
If your reasons for not registering are you are confused...then just register, you can spend the next few weeks figuring out what you think
Give yourself a chance to have a say in what your future looks like
You don't have a lot of time left to register to vote! Deadline is tomorrow! Please do it if you haven't already https://t.co/Krbcdr5ChE
@RadioX @rossy Nice one!! 💓💖💓
