@MaajidNawaz Can’t see your name here, why are you lying ? And then playing the victim ?

“No problem there” https://t.co/WiJtdpze0r
But, I’m not embroiled in a battle with him. and, it’s  not his research. As a side note I don’t think having sold upwards of 5 million albums, currently having a bestselling book and traveling the world playing concerts every night can be considered failure. https://t.co/bROk2oCRlL
I’ve not attacked you or anyone else at Quilliam,there is really no need for you to take this tone Quite a lot of people have a problem with your study, perhaps a measured response TO THE MANY (QUALIFIED) PEOPLE CHALLENGING IT might be more effective than one sided slanging match https://t.co/Hdp9SHnuUN
Look, some dude threw up your research to prove a point and I’d just read 3 articlessaying it wasn’t worth the paper it was written on. I re-posted them, I’ve never said anything about you personally, so what all this pop princess, white savior stuff is about I’m not sure. https://t.co/Hdp9SHnuUN
It’s not my research, I’m not a scientist, but I have read the report,and I don’t see how you could have taken reporting (as in, to the police) bias and conviction bias into your research, I would think both are vital when providing this kind of study. https://t.co/Ka9vffan8W
Who called you self hating ? I most certainly, didn’t, not sure why you’re being so defensive. https://t.co/Ka9vffan8W
How so, pls elaborate. https://t.co/lmoEcVjJhH
I certainly never said anything personal about @maajidnawaz, which is why I blocked him when he decided to attack me, my job and my character for calling it out. No need or time for that kind of chat tbh. https://t.co/j4fcpasAMo
I honestly didn’t set out to rattle anyone, just reposted a couple of articles that refuted the research, which is cited over and over again by Tommy Robinson and his lot. That figure crops up all the time On here and if it’s inacurate, they should correct it. It’s dangerous https://t.co/j4fcpasAMo

Accountability applies only to the marginalized.
It’s becoming more and more obvious that our legal system is completely flawed. Money buys silence and the lawyers always win in the end.
The first issue I’m not so sure about, BUT the second, many people go the civil route because it’s so hard to get the police to take notice, not because they want paying off. I don’t think one should be able to add and NDA to a settlement for this sort of crime. https://t.co/drEW5agnlP

@Rockster001 Yes I do
Because you published your presumptions about my intentions without consulting me, you slandered and shamed me. https://t.co/btPi4K4ZHE
@martian_munk @Bruce35dc This says more about you than me, I’m TELLING you what happened, clearly and concisely, and you accuse me of lying based on what ? Do you know me ?
Do you go around constantly making a mental note of everything you’re wearing at any given time ? And New Orleans House of Blues is not a paparazzi hotspot. Take your judgement elsewhere. Thanks https://t.co/WJtU9rXh8x
@martian_munk @Bruce35dc I didn’t, the picture was taken when I was walking from the concert venue in New Orleans (where I’d just dosed up on attention thanks) to my tourbus, id forgotten I wasn’t wearing a bra (this top actually performs the same job) and I wasn’t expecting to see any paparazzi. So no.

Fine, then print the picture, just allow the patronising accusatory blurb. The media need to change the way they talk about wimmins. Breasts are not little secret fun bags, to be kept hidden until Man wishes to discover them for himself. Fuck that. https://t.co/vkm7n8lCmo
Firstly this is a picture of a field, secondly, please get over yourselves, there is nothing outrageous about breasts. Lots of people have them, they were originally made for feeding small humans with, they’re not rude sex bits. This rhetoric is so dangerous. Please STOP https://t.co/aRpcIbTaL5

Steve Bannon never says what he thinks, he says what he knows will provoke and gain traction. Im sure his pollsters are poised to give us that percentage when the time is right. https://t.co/5pUKO4ygw1

No. This is believable, the accounts being deleted are obviously the automated ones designed to attack and harass those with a platform and a conscience. In my opinion the bought inactive ones, to boost follower counts still exist. https://t.co/RGmxItTPDi

@YidRaven @WEP_UK @paladinservice Goodbye Daniel.
@YidRaven @WEP_UK @paladinservice No no, what YOU did is called spin sweetheart. Now run along
@unbeatabletipex @WEP_UK @paladinservice Tommy Robinson has been arrested and been sent to jail before. I haven’t, so if your going to hold peoples past actions against them why not start with him.
@YidRaven @WEP_UK @paladinservice I can’t see “oh well she'd have been raped by a white bloke anyway" anywhere in there
@YidRaven @WEP_UK @paladinservice Please link to the quote
@YidRaven @WEP_UK @paladinservice No, although that is how what I did say was reported. It’s called spin.
I teamed up with the @WEP_UK party and @paladinservice to highlight the problems with the police and their  attitudes towards women when reporting violent crime. Amongst other things. What have you done ? https://t.co/2yhm8LuZsl
To the people clogging up my timeline with Tommy Robinson Free Speech related outrage, he was in contempt of court, these kids are just expressing themselves through music. Save your outrage for them. https://t.co/XWdK49irLC

@hasief Obviously I couldn’t talk, or direct the driver so my assistant instructed the occupant of the car behind to “follow that cab” I believe the occupant was @chattyman , I have no idea what happened next.
@hasief Well, actually they put me into an empty taxi, and then the paps caught wind, so my assistant shouted “go go go” .

So disappointed in this government, but no longer surprised by them and their disregard for human life both at home and abroad.Air strikes in Syria without parliamentary approval should be cause for concern for everyone. Our ambivalence is the strongest weapon in the artillery.

June 8th , the interview is from October 2017. Your guess as to why this story ran today is as good as mine. https://t.co/ZoWiLcToh3
Police routinely ignore victims of abuse.I know this from talking to victims and from my own experience, as do the Mail. I am as outraged and upset by the treatment of the victims in Rotherham as everybody else, that’s why Mail want to suggest otherwise. Divide and rule tactics. https://t.co/4i7kNKs0rw
Oh , it’s because of this story. To give  some contrast and to remind Mail readers that it’s not abuse unless the perpetrator is brown. I see you and your woman hating tactics Mail Online. And I stand with any victim of abuse, contrary to what the Mail would have you believe. https://t.co/PzMt1eEkC4
Oh that’s strange, this is from an interview I did in October last year. @mrjamesob why are they printing this today ? https://t.co/tI7sZzT9uf https://t.co/zDlZ8fU2ko
Get it @KALIUCHIS https://t.co/t88c4Ed2i3
@alexander_olly @rejjiesnow @guardian Really loved this interview
@paul_sweb @DylanStrain @IamalrightJack I think a lot of these parties are actually covers for ‘meetings’ that if we’re logged as such in any official capacity, would raise eyebrows and prompt serious questions. It’s hiding in plain sight. See also charity galas and fundraisers.
@paul_sweb @DylanStrain @IamalrightJack I think she had started at radio 4 already. There was no placement, this lot chose to sit together. It was very cosy, I felt like I was invited to throw off a scent, which is why I posted the video.
