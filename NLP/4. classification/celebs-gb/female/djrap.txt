@BestBuySupport Ive already explored this to the fullest and explained myself over. There is no resolve unless you want to replace data. Knowing you won't do that, I ask you now to leave the matter. If only I had had this much concern when I actually had the issue. Amazing what a tweet can do.
@ias0na @aerielist I did not forget, there was a printing error on the labels, but I thought this was a nice way to amend that as I felt bad for him. By making sure the world knew on another record. Stuff happens, what you gonna do? The right thing.

@BestBuySupport The problem with both stores is a lack of real knowledge by staff both in store and online to fully inform the customer. And a lack of care when on the phone seeking support. Im sure that is not what you want, so I hope you try to change that. Thanks for the reply.
@BestBuySupport Yes I did. No support whatsoever. I was told to contact Seagate. Same with Frys, no warranty when you buy online. Useful info to have had before purchase.
@TaylaVinny @Seagate @BestBuy I use only G drives now for everything, stand alone and portable, they are amazing.
@Seagate I contacted them, was told they would replace drive. Not helpful to me when data is lost and drive is 5 months old, how about  about replacing data for customers when drives fail. There's an idea.

@DwnTwnWill @SpiritAirlines To be fair, they offered a partial refund as I booked with Priceline, so the cost was not shown. still, put me off flying with them again.
@DropWeirdSci @SpiritAirlines They were kind enough 2 respond and to offer a partial refund because of their error. But I won't fly them again. It's the principle The end
@DropWeirdSci @SpiritAirlines Look, it was not. They admitted that if you book through Priceline or another 3rd party the info is not there/which is not cool. End of.
@DropWeirdSci @SpiritAirlines No, it was booked on Priceline so that information is not there. But it should be, right? I mean how is the customer supposed to know?
@DropWeirdSci @SpiritAirlines No actually, they don't.
