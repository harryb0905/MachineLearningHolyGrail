@NimkoAli You are a warrior, and hell of a woman. It seemed to me yesterday that across the political spectrum, people were disgusted with Chope's actions, especially as his "principles" are so elastic. This is a setback, but not the end.

@caramaka wonderful job as Nimrod Jordan. Great to see you crushing it on screen. 👊🏾xxx
@CarlySimoneXo @chizzyakudolu So sorry you face that. A friend of mine was (prob still is) asked constantly if she was/is the nanny of her children esp the youngest, because his skin is very light. Her clever clap-backs never erased the pain inside.
@catbateson So far this series is great, the book is a much harder-to-stomach read because it details so much ugly truth. You should certainly read it.
Love this! Yes Yasmin! Xxx🙌🏾 https://t.co/DvLMbXmAJd
@whowatme @OtimTheGreat Thank you! Just a small note, I was a school kid in the 80s, perhaps you meant 90s? I didn’t start my music until ‘94. Xx
@Maenllwyd @BBCOne Thank you. Xxxx
@mrsnickih @DigitalDan85 @BBCOne That’s fair enough.  I was so taken by the fact that so much of the story was rooted in ugly truth. As I was reading I was thinking, did my ancestors go through this? Did they endure that? Xx
@OtimTheGreat No worries. As it goes on you see the whole colourism nastiness come to the fore (again, if it follows the book). I was devastating in parts reading it, cringing. Let’s see what part 2 brings. Xx
@PaaWOWW @BBC TOTALLY see your point, especially as we have all witnessed some “interesting” casting in the past with people of colour..! Xx
@JHawxwell @BBCOne Sometimes the truth is ugly, brutal and raw. Yet we must still face it and learn from it.
@RAINBOWBLAK @angielemar @clareanyiamo @LennyHenry @AmmaAsante I have seen a few “oh this is race-baiting stuff” type tweets. 🙄Some bloke suggested Sir Len has a chip on his shoulder... as opposed to simply portraying a (small) truth of the heinous nature of slavery and its effects.
@PaaWOWW @BBC I read the book. The casting is deliberate. July is taken for “full negro” because of her skin/nose/hair despite white overseer Tam Dewar being her biological father. Much is made of her appearance as the story unfolds. Hope this helps. X
@OtimTheGreat Hi Otim. The casting is accurate in that they followed the book. The character July in telling her life story explains how she was indeed mixed race but dark skinned, and as this regarded as “full negro” to quote the book.
@MahaliaBelo You too are glorious, thank you so much for this. Xxxxx
@annie12888 I was saying to another Twitterer that the accents are most likely softened so no one can fail to understand the plot. I guarantee the actors would have “gone in” harder if they were given that freedom. Xx
@chizzyakudolu Girl, that scene.... the #colourism was and sadly still is so strong...😔
Thank you to this beautiful cast for bringing #AndreaLevy’s brilliance to life on the screen. Also the Beeb for making it prime time viewing. Xxx https://t.co/L1KIGTO9Wn
YES for the outro music for #TheLongSong  “Hill an’ gully”! Mum sang that to me all the time as a child! #Joy #memories #Jamaicanheritage xxxx

@NanaRaine Yes a few are using that tired reasoning, as though it’s some kind of an excuse. He was not ill. He was angry his “demand” was not adhered to and that’s when his racist core came to the surface. As for Ryanair...their response sickens me.
@NanaRaine I know Nana! He should have been removed and arrested, instead #Delsie was moved! So wrong.
How could I let the day come to a close without sending condolences to the victims of the gunman at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Beautiful souls just cut down like that.This is truly a dreadful day for news.

Ryanair: Apologise to &amp; compensate Delsie Gayle for racist abuse on your flight - Sign the Petition! https://t.co/D5dh5BIdVd via @UKChange
@PJSoul Beautiful in theory...❤️ only of course @Ryanair do not have a first class cabin. In fact after seeing they way they have handled this entirely disgusting affair, I would say they have zero class.
@hitenvora01 @Ryanair So wrong and awful. 🤬🤬🤬🤬
@richardodurrant @Ryanair I know. I was mad as all hell.
@Gez2wo9ine @therealredman @TheDoppelgangaz @marcopolobeats @SONNYJIM01 @Scorzayzee My pleasure. Xxx
@sarahloustanley @Ryanair Totally agree with you. Xxx
@Gez2wo9ine @therealredman @TheDoppelgangaz @marcopolobeats @SONNYJIM01 @Scorzayzee Thank you, appreciate the love. Xxx
@richardodurrant @georgeous427 @cassidyjanson @enriqueiglesias @StagesFest 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
@MiddxMinxx @sourmanarti @Ryanair I feel nothing but disgust at this man. My position is that of Tee, I’d rather know the state of mind of the abused lady. Hope she’s ok, no doubt shaken and angry.
@DionDublinsDube @Ryanair Mi dear! I was so vexed! 🤬🤬🤬
@NorwichB01 @Ryanair Honey never be ashamed to be who you are. That moron doesn’t represent you. Xxx
@richardodurrant @georgeous427 @cassidyjanson @enriqueiglesias @StagesFest That’s not how it works... let’s just breath ok?
@scarlettbrown89 You relax as much as poss. Xxxx❤️
@sourmanarti @Ryanair 1) harsh?! I haven’t even begun... 2) His mental state does not change the fact that he committed a crime, (whatever happens next).  3)The “mentally ill loner” is another tired trope when it comes to racial abuse. No, nope and hell no.
@BridieStearn @Ryanair @DjMunro and I just said the same thing. Trying to be kind here...maybe folk initially failed to understand what was happening? (God knows how though..?)
@Kevin_Paycare @Jane_Stevenson_ @Ryanair Exactly correct. Xxxx
@sourmanarti @Ryanair Have a look, won’t take long... https://t.co/C97P5sNaD9
@BridieStearn @Ryanair I was fuming when I saw this B.
@Jane_Stevenson_ @Ryanair Just sickens me to my core. Police are now involved... after the outcry of course..and the tardiness in reporting this to the police is on Ryanair.
@hammer100 @Ryanair Yup..I can totally believe that. Xxx
@Dogearedtatty @Ryanair Thank you. I mean that. ❤️ When you say silent you are complicit. Xx
@SaraMenitra @Ryanair Sickening situation.
@NeilBaker8 @NonswMas @Ryanair Asking that lady to move was weak. He absolutely should have been marched off the flight by police, who should have been alerted by crew.
@ChinaraEvents @Ryanair Sadly yes, as we see and hear the “they are naturally aggressive” trope over and over again, so action would have been swift. ALL racial abuse I happen to witness from ANYONE gets shut down by me.
@hammer100 @Ryanair I’m positive the crew were being pressed to leave on time. However all bets are off when someone commits a criminal act on board a flight. That surely becomes the priority? Is that not policy? If not it SHOULD be with immediate effect. Xxx
@ppvernon @Change @BARACUK @DavidLammy @HackneyAbbott @LennyHenry @Bonn1eGreer @malorieblackman @DavidHarewood @kwamekweiarmah @HelenGrantMP Signed. Chipped in. Xxxx
My god. @Ryanair this is a criminal act. Instead of reasoning with that man, he should have been removed and police called. If that was my mum, not even Jesus could’ve saved that scumbag from me. https://t.co/tsFbRjoFvj

@MarkSyder @davidebrady I did too, in the 2nd year at senior school but sadly our teacher left and was not replaced....
@LeGateauChoc Something like that. Her opinion of me as an artist is one thing. The rank stupidity in the “she wasn’t even born” comment is what tickled me! People like @simon_schama @akalamusic @Lucy_Worsley @Bonn1eGreer better find new careers! 🤣
@LeGateauChoc No idea my luv, as the saying goes, “there’s nowt as queer as folk”. Xxx
@fatboyfidget Oh absolutely. Tbh it was the wry humour I found in the “she wasn’t even born” comment that I couldn’t resist. 🤦🏾‍♀️
@MarkFranklin123 I am my luv, hope you are too. Incredibly sad couple of days but WONDERFUL to see the outpouring of love for #QueenAretha xxxx❤️
@lockie1981 It was sis, I got the news at 4pm, and it was a tough one to do. It’s always a joy to speak of your heroes but so hard when their physical presence has just left. Luckily for us her spirit lives on and always will. Xxx
@masato_jones @BBC @lauramvula She will never leave us. She is immortal. Xxxxx❤️
I’m 45. I grew up listening to The Queen like every soul artist, so a fair bit as it goes... I guess according to your logic, we should bin all historical learning once it’s beyond living memory, I mean, who will be qualified to teach it eh? 🙄 https://t.co/QTxuZGlZQO

@MMCORE1 It’s disgraceful to have someone with the world’s biggest platform tell the world that our hospitals have blood all over the floors, when it’s an untruth, made me mad! That’s not politics as such, just correcting #FakeNews ❤️xx
@BridieStearn 😂😂😂😂exactly B! Xxxx
Trump spoke of a once prestigious Central London hospital with blood all over the floors. You state he is quoting Dr Griffiths. Can you therefore point to that line in the statement you yourself provided?  #FactsMatter https://t.co/2D66HMzto6

@Thomma66 @Channel4News In addition, the British Nationality act of 1981 removed my right to be classed as English. Legally I/folk like me cannot call ourselves English, because we don’t have English parents/heritage.
@Thomma66 @Channel4News No, we are British.. Roots elsewhere, but very much British. That is, until the stroke of a pen in the name of legislation says otherwise.

@AskAmexUK Hello team, I have a quick question re my account, can you DM so I can explain? Thanks so much!
Listening to @KISSTORYUK on the motorway, moaning about the weather/stationary traffic and @mjcole’s “Be Sincere” comes on feat my girl @ElisabethTroy1.. heaven. Contentment restored. ❤️ xxx
@GeriMcPFitness Ah..! Thank you for the info my luv. Officious fools hounded him out them, poor man. So glad he has another job where he can be himself and spread his warmth. Xxx
@HeatherEmbrey1 Yes for Colin Spencer in Stockport ! ☺️Now hoping it prevails for Bryan Broom in Humberside poor man... xxxx
@BridieStearn Exactly correct B. I am hoping Humberside council see sense as Stockport have, and give this kindly man his job back. Xxx
@lockie1981 I know that ban was lifted luv, it’s the one in my video I mean. The gent from Humberside. Xxxx
Anyone know the latest on this? Stockport council just reversed their STUPID ban on Colin Spencer high-fiving kids.. probably because they got humiliated by the media into doing it... https://t.co/CRkZ7zSGQ3
Wish I could have seen his work onstage, and not just onscreen. So many people talking about how awesome it was. Xxx https://t.co/NJbaYXeG8F

@DanielleDASH You absolutely nail it. Top to bottom re -education is in urgent need. I am so glad your voice is able to ring loud and clear as a survivor. Xxxx
@DanielleDASH This breaks my heart. I visited a refuge for women who escaped domestic abuse, in Wolves. The stories of cruelty and control were breathtaking. As you say D, she everything she could, and still was murdered.
Arrested for protesting against the law that banned women from voting. 100years ago today, the first phase of #suffrage for #UKWomen came to pass. Wealthy, landing owning women over 30 were first up. Ten years later it rolled out to all who were 21 and over. #Vote100 👊🏾 https://t.co/8Ujy8y3Ohl
@scarlettbrown89 Many good folk out there providing reason more eloquently than  me. ❤️Millions of us are baffled as to why that man is still there. He needs to stop talking utter rubbish about the #NHS though. Xx
@Kerrys2Cents Yup... good point...!
@MarkSyder @realDonaldTrump EXACTLY RIGHT! Xxxx
Ummm... no. People marched to protest the cuts in the budget. One of the UK’s greatest achievements was  the creation of the NHS. They marched because it is loved!  God, why did the US vote this bloke in?!🤦🏾‍♀️ #NHS70 https://t.co/Y7BWL1ZUme
@lozziedora @rubyturnersoul @MsAmberPRiley @cassidyjanson Fabulous! Thank you! Xxx
@michellegayle1 HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL LADY! 🎂❤️xxxx

This father’s child was one of Nassar’s victims. I am hoping he was not charged with contempt of court. The bright side is no one in jail goes easy on a nonce. Especially a prolific one. https://t.co/W7L8LkZ9LI

I echo everything Laurie has said. Cyrille and his legacy transcends club rivalries, all of which was parked outside the Hawthorns today. He unified us all. @WBA def did him proud. @CoventryCityFC @astonvilla (&amp; my) @Wolves ❤️xxx https://t.co/CethIqnk8W

@MaryIsokariari You are kidding me?! That is awful. What possible benefit is there in creating such a group?
Watching a news report on the avoidance of smear tests by women too embarrassed to attend. Lowest attendance in 20 years. Cervical cancer is no joke. Don’t blank your appointment. #SmearForSmear

Are the rumours true? That #MauriceWhite, founder of the greatest ever R&amp;B band, will not be honoured in song at the #Grammys? #gutted
