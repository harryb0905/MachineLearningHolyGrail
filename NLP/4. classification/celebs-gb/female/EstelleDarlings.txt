I understand the brevity of this year’s voting.   I love our freedoms.  Here and around the world.  I’d like to keep them.  I’m voting.  You should too. https://t.co/oNGNpt3cjD
having sung in countless rooms and supporting many people we wish were now running the country but not being able to actually cast a ballot in their names - I’m glad to say this year, one of the most IMPORTANT years - Im grateful I can vote.
(We dedicated American Boy to him at the EMA’s) and after living through our great President @BarackObama and First Lady @MichelleObama ‘s presidency and supporting @HillaryClinton in the last campaign...
My African, West Indian and British heritage has taken me around the world more times than I can count and yet I landed here in this time, at this point in life. I arrived to the US a year before you beautifully elected the 44th President of the US.
I’ve been living here in the US for 11 years. I’ve been blessed to be a part of, support and help push along the idea of a real democracy in my music, lifestyle and choices. When I moved here I came with a clear identity about who I am and where I am from. https://t.co/6CWFhlG5EE

The pinned tweet top of my page .... and link in the bio on IG or search Estelle and it will come up.    And look When a bih do get engaged ... i mean I’ll let ya’ll know at some point. #privacyLawsofEstelle 🤷🏾‍♀️
And forget the sibs...) but it’s true. All 8 of them are so bomb. I’m happy to rep alongside them.   #ganggangitsnotagame  But... back to the point - i would like all you folks who liked the proposal pic to go stream the video and watch the story of Mike &amp; Deen on YouTube. It’s
Has been a North Star. The freedom with this album is that it’s taken time to actually manifest in my life what my mum said to me while ago...”Go.  Live. Were good.” My sisters and brothers played a huge role in allowing me this freedom too. ( artists always shout out the rents..
Like “thanks for the well wishes did you see the video?” We laughed abt it but then i thought abt the fact that I’m so glad to be their kid, grown ass daughter, baby. My parents support through my entire career (good and real “what is that? Explain it to me again?! Me: 🙈😩)
Not that i hated the volume of likes the business woman in me said “yay” i think what annoyed me is, some were just looking at the pic and scrolling ( if course - IG )some we ain’t spoke in YEARS, you’re never on my page... I’m def looking at you folks crazy, when i see you next,
Was talking to my parents earlier abt the fact that people liked the crap outta a STILL from my vid of me getting proposed to by one of the wonderful lead guys in my video, without reading the caption... people who def didn’t check out the album out, had so many congrats to give,
...Sitting at my parents house. Eating a bowl of “midnight” chicken &amp; Jollof and drinking sasparilla #RealOnesKnow  Thinking abt what to give you guys next...a book or tv series?

@LiansManSNW I Said what i said - in an “A+ B” tweet related to My African &amp; West Indian heritage. C your way to your timeline w that trolling ass BS... Faaaaaaanx. 🤗
@Lenathejoyful @solomonmissouri ...Preciate the compliment. I love yellow!
@Lenathejoyful @solomonmissouri ...ok. Assuming you’re from the US ( also if you’re not..) “Chile!” isn’t “native”, it’s African American slang. In this case  day it in similar  context as “Girl!” Or an excited “Friend!!!” (It’s totally fine to say black or African American when speaking about the culture) 🤗

It’s a lot energetically happening right abt now. Everyone is affected one way or another. Have to take a moment. Just pull back off it all for a min.
Tryna do that right now. This is helping: https://t.co/gN81rYBki3
My friend @RosesGabor said to me the other day.. “sometimes not a reaction, sometimes sit with it. Listen. Mull it over. See all sides. Think abt it.” Probably the most poignant piece of advice I’ve gotten this week...

Still something resonates in these plastically bending chords and Stevie’s voice singing our pain.
My personal faith stays unwavered.
Nothing weirder than listening to Stevie sing “Heaven is 10 zillion light years away” on a warped piece of vinyl that i won’t trash, as i open Twitter and see this Starbucks fckry.... #Morethingschangemoretheystaythesame #SteviewasaProphet #SameStruggle 😔
