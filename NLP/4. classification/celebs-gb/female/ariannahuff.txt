How much of tonight’s “bipartisanship” will he take back tomorrow morning on Twitter? #SOTU
It’s almost as if there was a wall, or a steel slat barrier, between Pence and Pelosi.#SOTU
And he failed to boast about his longest-ever shutdown — the one achievement in which he truly is number one. #SOTU
Among the many ominous messages in that speech, this might be the worst: the connection of peace with the cessation of congressional oversight. #SOTU
And we're supposed to reject “the politics of resistance"? That’s pretty much what America was founded on.
Trump applauds getting rid of the ACA mandate and yet then says he wants to protect coverage of those with pre-existing conditions — has no clue how the two are connected.  https://t.co/OfwMlCUIBC

He says “I will get it built.” But he’s notably more silent than he used to be on who will pay for it. The woman behind him with the gavel has some say.
I guess he couldn’t find a cringy rhyme for “oversight."
Great seeing the large group of women lawmakers wearing white to honor the suffragettes. #SOTU
Maybe Trump will be more honest tonight — that he thinks there’s a racial emergency. There isn’t of course, any more than there’s a national emergency, but we all  know what he means by national emergency.
