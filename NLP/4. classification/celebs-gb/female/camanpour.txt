A void in Syria at this time will leave the field to Russia, Iran, Assad, ISIS remnants, Al Nusra, and more. Not America’s friends. Long term planning may have to begin now to meet the blowback down the line.
Important to recall the harsh criticism President Obama received for pulling out of Iraq too early, and then having to send back full US force when ISIS filled the void. It took 4 years to push them out of Mosul.
NATO and US allies praise Secretary Mattis and lament his departure. He is considered a steady and highly experienced pair of hands.

@David_Cameron Cameron also tells me that he supports Theresa May’s decision to strike Syria: "This is not about regime change in Syria, although God knows we need it. It's not about intervening in the civil war. It is about making a point that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable" [6/6]
@David_Cameron But: "I don't think you can belong to these organizations and see their powers grow and treaty after treaty and power after power going from Westminster to Brussels and never asking the people whether they're happy governed in that way." [5/6]
@David_Cameron On Brexit, @David_Cameron tells me he doesn't regret calling the referendum, but wishes the result had gone the other way. Still thinks UK has "taken the wrong course" by leaving the EU. https://t.co/MFTZtNPqtT [4/6]
@David_Cameron "We've got to be realistic," he said. "Sometimes we look at a country like Somalia… and the international community almost says, 'Right, we've got this great plan to turn you into Denmark, this model of democracy, in a very short period of time.' It's totally unrealistic." [3/6]
@David_Cameron "You may find you get one person, one vote -- but it might be one person, one vote, once," Cameron says. It could override the system "and you don't get the genuine democracy." [2/6]
In his first major broadcast interview since stepping down as UK prime minister, @David_Cameron tells me that for fragile states to go straight to an election after civil strife isn’t always the right thing, and could undermine democracy. https://t.co/MFTZtNPqtT [1/6]

@andersoncooper @AC360 @arwaCNN Cat Colvin: "I really thought Marie's death would be sort of a watershed event, and the world would take notice, or the US government would find the targeting and murder of an American citizen intolerable. But none of that happened."
@andersoncooper @AC360 @arwaCNN The Syrian government did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the case, but has previously denied targeting journalists.
@andersoncooper @AC360 Lawyer Scott Glimore: "What [the defector] revealed was really that from the moment that Marie, Paul Conroy and other journalists -- @arwaCNN, Paul Wood from the BBC -- as they were arriving in Lebanon, there were intelligence sources tracking their movements."
@andersoncooper @AC360 According to unsealed court documents, a former Syrian agent turned defector says that the Assad regime "regularly monitored" TV broadcasts. A top intel official "wanted to learn their location and take the necessary measures to stop them from reporting," the defector said.
@andersoncooper @AC360 "If I could throw Assad in prison, that's what I would do," Cat Colvin told me. Short of that, she said, "I think that every penny I can get out of the Assad regime is less that they can spend on barrel bombs and chemical weapons."
The day before she was killed, the journalist Marie Colvin told @andersoncooper/@AC360 that the Syrian war was "the worst" conflict she had ever covered.

@GenMhayden @nytimes 5/ “CIA officers feel a genuine sense of betrayal as to what happened to them as we changed administrations in this country.”
@GenMhayden @nytimes 4/ Hayden says that despite President Trump’s professed belief that the US should “fight fire with fire” and that torture “absolutely” works, there is no chance the CIA would once again use the techniques.
@GenMhayden @nytimes 3/ CIA officers, Hayden says, “asked the appropriate organs of government whether this was constitutional, lawful, and consistent with American treaty obligations. They were given yes answers to each of those. They did their duty.”
@GenMhayden 2/ The @nytimes reports that while running a CIA prison in Thailand, Pres. Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, Gina Haspel, oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects and her name was on a cable giving instructions to destroy video evidence documenting their interrogations.

4/ But the "greatest risk," she said, is "that the President and his team give this an effort, but because they don't get every single thing that they want that they say it's hopeless, and really create the prerequisite for war."
3/ Sherman said that while she did not believe Kim is "in any rush to denuclearize," she was glad the US is entering into talks, even if it just starts with a meeting. "Talk is certainly better than war."
2/ Sherman, who served as special adviser to President Clinton on North Korea, traveled to the country with then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2000. She was the chief US nuclear negotiator with Iran under President Obama.
Kim Jong-un has "already achieved a major objective, from his perspective," fmr top US negotiator Wendy Sherman tells me. "He has been able to get the President of the United States -- the most powerful leader in the world -- to sit in the same room as him as if he is an equal."
