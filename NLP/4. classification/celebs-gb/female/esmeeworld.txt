I am a terrible liar and incredibly honest you can tell what I'm thinking just by the look on my face.
My heart is breaking from watching what is going on in the world today.
There are always two sides to a story, and more often than not somewhere in the middle is where you will find the truth.
So we keep waiting Waiting on the world to change
We see everything that's going wrong with the world and those who lead it feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it.
@luka_OSA Aaw thanks darling! x
