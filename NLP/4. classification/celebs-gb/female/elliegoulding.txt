@brown_graeme If I did it was absolutely not my intention. I loved my time playing in an orchestra! I have made an entire classical album (last year) that I have had to put on hold. I think people forget how much my interviews are tinged with nerves and awkwardness
'Do You Remember' from the movie @FightingWMyFam is out everywhere. You can watch the lyric video on YouTube. https://t.co/7IB9znAikE https://t.co/R1AhSFBB2m
