@southernelecPD power to the people! #Hoorbloodyray!!!!!!!!!!
@southernelecPD so how come it takes 12 hours to fix. You are lying to us. There is no one solving this problem.
@southernelecPD you need to tweet a picture of the people trying to fix this as I am VERY sceptical . Only way to save face
I'm listening to White Christmas by Irving Berlin on @classicfm http://t.co/8lpChrc9n3 #nowplaying
@southernelecPD sarah what is going on , we still have no power. That means no water too. Have very elderly relatives and small babies
@alicepowell update at 8pm after saying it would be on at 6pm
@JohnskinXx no power still nearly 35 hours in total
@alicepowell us too. 45 minutes on hold
@southernelec  @southernelecPD what is going on, still no power why can't I speak to an actual human being? What am I paying for?
@southernelec @southernelecPD no power,no water Have babies,94 year old as well as working farm,neighbours etc.why can't  i spk to human
@amandakyme nope bloody awful but candles lit and fire,Aperol in hand
@britton_mike I am talking for everyone merry bloody Xmas
@southernelecPD phew we'll if there is any left after this trying day-you can come round for a sherry if you succeed
@southernelecPD also been told no one working as Xmas eve,surely this cannot be trueyou wasn't leave your customers in dire straits at Xmas?
@southernelecPD we have no power therefore no water, livestock suffering and kids in tears Why are we getting no information or help
Let's shame them into helping us. Neighbours in despair. Working farms desperate and children in tears!!!!!!
Where is Chipping Norton nearest supply as that is where the problem is! I want to drive there and make sure someone is working on it!
Is Southern Elec doing anythin to restore power in villages nr Chipping Norton!No water even! All in despair here! #notpayingthismonthsbill!
