Every time I turn on shower I hear fantom sounds of my baby crying . Is it just me ? #MummyDiaries
@WhitneyCummings just text me  “you know you’ve made it when you don’t know what country you are in “  when i told her I’m in Germany tho I arrived in UK today - really it’s just that I’m that tired
I guess I’m really good at make up . Just did my first show after having a baby . And somehow the bags under my eyes from not sleeping for nights on end didn’t show up on camera #goodproducts or #goodlighting
It’s 2.44 . Baby is finally asleep . Jet lag win baby is no joke. I had to push him round the hotel in stroller for ages .
I haven’t mastered juggling mornings yet - caring for his needs while still having time for any kind of selfcare routine of my own. Would be interested to know what your morning ritual is mamas? Teach me your ways !
Motherhood has some tough moments. Was just so exhausted last night . And then I feel guilty to say that because he’s such a peaceful happy baby .
My baby has huge feet ! 😱🤣👶🏻 #TGIF 📷: @jonasmyrin https://t.co/aDL89Sysrb

I loved that @Adele broke her Grammy and gave half to @beyonce that is so honouring . Truly makes me happy. When artists lift each other up
Gold was definitley the Colour of the #grammys2017 . I'm all for it
When one truly shines, their light falls on everyone. Some try to stop other's shining cos they are afraid of what the light will reveal
She did great! @ladygaga . it's a beautiful thing to see one of your girls' shine that bright . So pleased for you ... keep shining ! https://t.co/UVwUO2aKGI

What does love look like ? #lovelookslike
Listening with respect and fascination does not mean u hav to agree . But be open to learn at  least to understand
Understanding another perspective makes you wiser . So travel outside your country ; outside your friend group, inside another's head
It's easy to only hear opinions the same as yours .Harder to be open. But it's worth it.  Some one who knows everything knows nothing
I sometimes like to repost thought provoking articles on fb. It's good for people to hear opinions different from our own.
A very somber change over . Don't know how to put my feelings to words https://t.co/1PIwxjN65p
Being creative, writing songs , living love , love u btw

@Ms_KathyJ I had braces too at one point. Doesn't go well with eating in public :) worth it in the end tho.
@Rialucette good point... you want to be told but just don't yell it really loud for everyone to notice
@IAmCatalisst tru!
Would you rather someone told you if you had lettuce in your teeth? or does that embarrass you?
@natashabdnfield @NatyTrickyAngel Sometimes the truth just hurts too much tho. Is it kinder not to point out someones flaws for example?
@natashabdnfield @NatyTrickyAngel it depends though. I'd rather know the truth about injustices in the world even if it shakes mine up.
@NatyTrickyAngel REally good question. I'd like to say that its better to know the truth but you've got to be ready to handle it.
