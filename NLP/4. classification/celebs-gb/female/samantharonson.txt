@MofDP thank you!
hopefully more people like @ava and her documentary 13th and @UncleRUSH and @MichaelSkolnik continue to spread this knowledge and open eyes. https://t.co/WlnvIU7nHf
hopefully we see more and more artists and anyone with a platform speaking up for each other and telling the stories that need to be told. https://t.co/WlnvIU7nHf
we need to see addicts and non-violent drug offenders as human beings who need help. not dangerous criminals. this only comes with education https://t.co/bbHsYyvXwO
Each work at #DrugPolicyMuseum tells a different story. Art can heal &amp; give hope, ultimately humanizing people's conditions. https://t.co/bbHsYyvXwO
@Toure coz it's fucking absurd.
we need "boots on the ground" but for those who aren't ready to show up, music and art can seep into the subconscious and plant seeds. https://t.co/riZHS0bGuu
a song like "what's going on" by marvin gaye continues to resonate long after the marches dispersed. but also we need the masses to show up. https://t.co/riZHS0bGuu
but i believe that if you have a platform then it is somewhat your duty as a citizen of the world to share knowledge and educate where u can https://t.co/GHGgWDjkh7
i think, sometimes, as artists we can just be here to provide an escape. a place to dance, laugh, refuel and forget for a moment. https://t.co/GHGgWDjkh7
merging the arts with activism, in my opinion, can be like following medicine with a spoonful of sugar, only better! https://t.co/HZQbn3tBBQ
