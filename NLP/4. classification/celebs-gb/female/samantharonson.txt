hopefully we see more and more artists and anyone with a platform speaking up for each other and telling the stories that need to be told. https://t.co/WlnvIU7nHf
we need to see addicts and non-violent drug offenders as human beings who need help. not dangerous criminals. this only comes with education https://t.co/bbHsYyvXwO
