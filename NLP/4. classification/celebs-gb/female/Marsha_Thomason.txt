4, If you live in ME, TN, AK, GA, UT, NC, WY, LA, KS, SC, or KY, for the sake of a generation of children...
3, DeVos is uninterested in separating church &amp; state. She wants to implement a voucher program that has already been proven disastrous...
2, DeVos is unqualified &amp; discriminatory. She wants to funnel public education funding toward private religious schools...
1, We are 3 votes short of blocking Betsy DeVosfrom becoming Secretary of Education...

@Speak_ECee Milk and Granola are neither a species or a race. It's all about perception I guess. #myopinion
Why is Mel the Milk &amp;Granola bar so upset to be mixed? He tells his parents"you didn't think what life wld be like for me" Then sighs sadly.
Am I the only person disturbed by the connotations of the Kraft milk bites ad "Parents". As a bi racial woman, I'm not     amused. At all!
