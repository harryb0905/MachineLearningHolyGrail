@taylor_cassita Jeff beck asked me to learn Moon River in soundcheck. I paced dressing room @RoyalAlbertHall attaching words to objects.
@garethfrysound @BroadwayGirlNYC @HPPlayNYC actually, I believe it was @stevenhoggett who chose the song, which I mangled for the moment

Hello @iAmShakka - I LOVE this song SOOOOOO much. Just heard it on @seanibremix @1Xtra - it speeeeAAAks to me
I don't know why I love this so much!!!!!! Wow! Listen to Heart the Weekend - Single by Shakka  https://t.co/9oeND21snZ
Just heard the best track/almost had an accident driving the car coz I needed to dance so bad! @seanibremix 'who said I ain't got no money?'
Well that was fun! My @SFHUK lot of a lunch with me at home raised a nice bit of money for their awesome work! Really enjoyed the night too
This is also a birthday present to myself - work in progress but looking FINE! Oh my oh my https://t.co/o9kKQzfY1l
@me_the_machine my birthday present to myself is printing out 100s of mock up 'creative passports' for everyone at an event the day before!
The blanket of night descends upon this old house, while the studio and I go down long vocal rabbit holes together on this song.
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic I stand by my words. If you'd like to interpret it differently for some reason that's your choice.
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic tone of voice, context, heat of the moment, all also part of whatever I said, omitted here.
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic coz that's ridiculous but e.g. to know roughly where in the world fans are would help me plan tours
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic meanwhile about to exchange the £28k left from selling 200 copies to pay toward the Mycelia tour
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic so yes, I did read it and considered a lengthy reply as you were miles off but turned into a sigh
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic actual story on Sony/DRM: I remember screaming /crying in anger at Sony A&amp;R on discovering that!
@davidgerard @herzmeisterderw @Buzzsonic the point wasn't to sell copies (was given away for free too), it was to spark discussion/a change
@rufuswainwright would love to invite you to a special thing, can we DM? Xx hope you're well my love xx
For my local hospice @SFHUK i'm giving a lunch for two with me at my home for their online auction! Interested? Xx https://t.co/ZubwyjWnZk

@jordjitsuboi definitely taking photos xx
@rahrahmaybe oh yes, lots of cellos, even a piccolo snuck in there!
@adumfoley yes, most likely you will, earlyish next year xx we all want it to happen!
Who's excited about recording an orchestra tomorrow in a fantastic studio in Berlin?!   Er MEEEEEEE
ProTools session on laptop, with full score in lap probably wasn't so much fun for the guy sat next to me in his equally small seat!
@dangerous_tiny @TeamAriana one day, in the not so very distant future (within a year) they will be cheaper! @mimu_gloves
@OlafurArnalds oh wow! That would have been awesome but I have to head off 9am flight :/ p.s. Did you get my event invite? Xx
Off to Berlin tomorrow to record a string ensemble for the new song! It's been a while, will be studying the score on the plane over! Xx
A much younger version of me, a different person, is reaching out in time tonight to say #MeToo

In other news, my @Viberate_com profile has prodded me to get onto my socials a bit more! Facebook engagement = Poor, Twitter = average :/
@MametownsAmelia yes! Well relatively... Next year sept 2018- sept 2019. More madness soon.
P.s @Myspacetom... I know you're not doing that anymore, which is an added reason for my wanting to reach out + grab an hour with you? Xx

Just read how inappropriate my last two tweets look against the one prior to them. Need a deeper sensitivity between topics on a timeline
Ah, well as of 2.5 years, I don't have management, so that would explain that @Viberate_com. Would love to chat further + share what's next
Just discovered @Viberate_com. Fantastic! Linking the live music scene up and soon enabling tokens/crypto side = great news! @mycelia4music

@flight404 @_vade music deserves better, as do those who love to work and play with it xx
@flight404 @_vade it's so fragmented and disconnected.
@flight404 @_vade the way our music industry operates is an embarrassment.
@flight404 @_vade this is one reason I need some of @mycelia4music to exist. So people can work, play, collaborate easily with no risk.
@flight404 @_vade really? That is not cool at all. Was it an content ID automatic takedown thing?
@MrChrisEllis only just hearing of your situation now. Anything I can do at all to help Chris?
Thanks yeah great article :) loved to hear about Encore for musicians to connect with event bookers! Xx https://t.co/ifYTNpigRx

@DavidJayB @Lordofprog absolutely. 100% publishing royalty. Needs to be registered correctly. Xx
@Lordofprog however to be double safe, check with Imagem Publishers in the UK
@Lordofprog good lord what has the world come to
@Lordofprog I think legally anyone can cover H&amp;S without permission if song isn't altered and recording isn't sampled. Just credit? Xx
@SpazzCardigan hello. Whizzed through previews. Nice buzzy production! I'm in awe of anyone able to finish a record non stop :) xx good luck

Aw thank you @eliistender10 ! Have just bought #LittleBell&amp;TheMoon as scout was asking for girl book (and she loves the moon!) :) xx
Whaaaaaat??? Oh goodness... They were good times! @leviweaver @wallyjay @jezwiles @kidbeyond
@RichardWalters aww! Maybe coz I should sing slide descending rather than ascending and it upsets the natural order??
Ha! Glad to hear it's doing the trick... Though apologise if it gets annoying!! @RichardWalters xx
@ET_123 @IrishTimesBiz thanks for the interview @ChasTaylor ! Anyway to correct the misquote would be appreciated. Many thanks for the voice
@ET_123 @IrishTimesBiz @ChasTaylor ah! To clarify, I didn't mention piracy being an issue as I believe the issues are music industry side.
@czzpr @unbounders even more reason then! xx
I want to read this, pledging now... https://t.co/pmEAOuaobt also because @czzpr was one of #TheHappySong scientist/collaborators!
Yay! #TheHappySong is No.1 @myst3ry84 thanks for the good news!
So, I know it's a silly thing but #TheHappySong in now at no.2 in the UK @iTunes children's song chart. It's a happy day for UK babies :)
Scout and I went out to look for the moon this evening but it wasn't there, because 'Moon at School'. Ahh treasured times in the making
So #TheHappySong flies in at no.5 on UK @iTunes children's music chart, just behind 'Hakuna Matata' which Scout also likes (but not as much)
Loved working with you too @czzpr ! What a lovely project :) here's to happiness and beyond xx
P.s. You can download it #TheHappySong   https://t.co/DgWSii1DzO  And here's the making of film https://t.co/KEYQpwG8KS  Enjoy!! Xx
@adumfoley she loves it! Wrote it with me, inspired by and for her really! Xx

Yay!!! @krishalpin @SupaPass that is so lovely to hear! Xx
@Olaf_HB good! Working for adults :) wonder if it's working for those at the start of life?
@itsshaqii ahh sweet :) xx
@KnowltAII @sntnvmbr maybe I should have directed that to @IntricateInd xx what do you think? An A/B old school single?
Mmm! Maybe @KnowltAII  what you reckon @sntnvmbr ? Worth the risk?? Xx
The release of #TheHappySong and #TinyHuman to DSPs is tomorrow! One song about and one song for Babies :) would've made a sweet A/B side!
@_grammar_ you are so right... Doing it now!
On another plane! This time Oslo bound for @OsloIW to speak about @Mycelia4Music + a spot of @mimu_gloves waving.
@OliverJeffers We LOVE your books! Thank you so much. Scout asks for the Crayons book currently...almost 2 years old now :) x
@nadinebongaerts :) brilliant! Xx see you soon xx
@nadinebongaerts @hellotmrc looks awesome! Anyone got some curtains to hang up so I can sample my voice without sounding like I'm in a cave?
Hopefully next year July onwards ish @Johnl2001 @mimu_gloves not announced/planned or anything yet... Just hoping to pull it together
Prepping for @hellotmrc In Paris. So fun to have an hour just messing with my @mimu_gloves ! Can't wait to get stuck in for the tour :) xx
@Apagnanelli @mimu_gloves thank you! Xx really enjoyed it toooo. I may get in touch with your dad about glove WIFI if that's ok! Xx
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music we both agree on not selling out. I don't want to disrupt but pull us together toward a common goal
Goodnight all! sleeeeeeep much needed. All is looking good for 17th October to release 'the happy song'. Munchkins, prepare to be delighted
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music look forward to catch up with you another time Simon and less publicly over a coffee in town! X
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music I appreciate your honesty, pointy though it is. We'll both see over time if I understand or not.
@bittunes @amuse_io @SimonEdhouse @mycelia4music Lesson learned, sorry guys! I will endeavour to explain what I mean in a longer blog format
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music but yes that tweet on its own, as it stands, it's not the future but we are working towards it
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music bit by bit massaging this fragmented clunky music industry into something that makes sense for all
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music its thing for the artist/musicians. I feel working with people like @amuse.io we could get closer
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music portal idea.. One nice easy stop to upload a song once and be done with it... And trust it's doing
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music you're right Simon. Out of context and in a tweet it's not but you know I keep banging on about this
Hey @amuse_io @SimonEdhouse ... Could we look at getting @bittunes into that list of services please? @mycelia4music
@SimonEdhouse @amuse_io @mycelia4music saved me money and time having one portal to send out track info to major outlets. It's a good start
Good to see positive feedback on Frink Frink - Marble :) was a really fun crazy project. Also loved spending time in manchester's North 1/4
on a jet plane! Only other time I've seen mid air internet was with @PaulGAllen late 90's! Rather head of the tech curve that guy! (hello)
We used the free awesome new distribution service for artists called @amuse_io !! The future is now :) @mycelia4music
Will blog about the process. We did good to have it written, produced, performed live + up everywhere within a week @BrighterSound

@aisfornala I didn't recognise it (but still could have been a famous song)... But it was him, his voice, my mood and general craziness!

@wowitsjoey oh yeah... Forgot about the Katy perry song... Well Scout wasn't born still when that song came out, so she can be forgiven ;)
This song's working title is 'roar!' It's scout's fault  But don't worry a song for adults is next up for my calendar starting Monday!

@MrHodgesbeats @jeremyCowart @kickstarter I think it's a great alternative for 1,000s of musicians who'd pay for hotels in Nashville anyway
@chrisd1974 @jeremyCowart @kickstarter yes, that is true...but if you have to stay in a hotel anyway... it's a nice option!
LOVE this hotel idea from by @JeremyCowart. I just bought a night's stay in the Purpose hotel :) @Kickstarter https://t.co/zhCvBcy844
@jeremycowart @thepurposehotel pleasure! I think it's one of the best ideas I've heard EVER! go go go you guys! hope it goes global!
@bonersniper @rahrahmaybe @mycelia4music they are a little tentative! If there's one thing I don't lack, it's connections though :)
@rahrahmaybe @mycelia4music to be ironed out in all directions but it's gonna be awesome I can feel it in my bones!
I am so ridiculously excited!!!! It involves a new model for artists to tour and connects deeply with @mycelia4music. Bring it on!! 2017&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@michaellebor @HendrikFaller @NetflixUK @AmazonStudios The model for @mycelia4music could definitely work for film too I think! x
@NOTMYFIRSTIDEA @SupaPass WOW! amazing! I had no idea! Well then Heapsters it is! xx @julianameyer
Do they? Do you? @Supapass Would one (if one were to) call themselves a Heapster? Part of Imogenation? ones I've heard in the past.
I'm speaking w/ @JulianaMeyer from @SupaPass going through set up for my channel and asked if my fans have a collective name for themselves?

@Stevewal63 @Rumersongs @SangeetaHaindl I believe so too... With the help of uber linked data and some nifty curation tools!
@Rumersongs @Stevewal63 @SangeetaHaindl which is really what you should be able to do as an artist + be confident it's all in hand. One day!
@minilyra very glad you liked the music! I dare say eventually there'll be some form of soundtrack at some point but not for a while xx
@ZenfulDance not bad for 5 mins ;) thanks! If EB fancied sponsoring our @mycelia4music think and do weekend coffee ... We wouldn't say no!

@AlexHawkPhoto Definitely can't claim first wearable instrument to record, play and perform!! https://t.co/fZD6X553yT @mimu_gloves
@AlexHawkPhoto @mimu_gloves detect postures on top of this (big factor!) and I can play the piano/guitar/mbira without triggering stuff!

@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse music industry for a change! This year things really are going to shake up for the better.
@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse our efforts all the time. To be much more than just the sum of our parts. So enjoying being positive about our
@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse I don't want to create a platform. I want to find solutions and help us all work together so we aren't doubling
@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse everyone has done it for us. It's time to let us artists have a little play too with people to find answers
@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse be spending more time making music in the comfort knowing that those I'm doing business with a doing it fairly
@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse I don't have the answers of course. Merely a perspective of ideally what as an artist I'd love to help me...
@Jorj_X_McKie @SimonEdhouse hello guys! I'm happy to ride on my coat-tails if it means we all get together and figure stuff out.

Great, thanks Rhian @JonesJourno @MusicAlly. I've just replied in the comments section on a few details that are maybe not quite correct xx
Brilliant @benjamesbell! thanks for writing your thoughts. I've just written you a reply! Much love #Mycelia! xx @mus
A blog for those who wanted to know why I want us all to sign @DotMusic's bid for the .Music extension https://t.co/5HVapablDQ #Mycelia
@MimAbbyMason @dotmusic AND... It's open data! That's key when it comes to the database ... All copywrite/licensing info etc.
@MimAbbyMason @dotmusic or anyone else's for that matter. AND they have a majorly good plan on how to create a global music database!
@MimAbbyMason @dotmusic basically, imogenheap.music can be my identity as a musician online rather than Amazon's or Google's.
I just Q&amp;Ad Constantine @DotMusic for 2hrs. WE have to win the .Music TLD over the others https://t.co/cxXBRNXpa6 https://t.co/isGMn9SAwh
FOR THE LOVE OF MUSIC, EVERYONE needs to sign this! https://t.co/cxXBRNXpa6 It's IMPORTANT! Trust me! @DotMusic #Mycelia #FairTradeMusic
@dotmusic will do all I can. Believe TLD .Music could be the big kickstart to FairTradeMusic. Time to pool our resources!
Goodness gracious me I hope I can sleep. The @DotMusic idea has got my Heap brain a whirring! Time to re-energize. #HugsThePlanet
@marcusodair yup! Monday was tops! Am really revved about what we could work on together. Lots of love x Woop! x
Hey @DotMusic, Constantine Roussos. Is it decided? Can we talk? #Mycelia needs you! Can I have 10 mins to explain? https://t.co/3iuIQSIRGf

In the #TinyHuman video where i sing 'at 05:08 you break me apart again'...I'm the wheels, smoke and direction of that train. X
Scout, when she sleeps, is to me like a steam train, carving through a big country landscape on a peaceful calm night.
@GaryZero hello! Sorry had to race off. Would have been good to chat! Will keep in touch. Loved your panel :) exciting times
@sophie_goossens hello! I think either you or I missed out the crucial 'de' from the start of central. So much to explain in a short time. X

@cre8d thx xx I rather like it too. Crazy mad wonderful world this motherhood thing! Xx
@CapnKumo nothing planned sadly. One day, maybe someone will help get it on the market. Needs funding to get to next stage :/ xx
@PVBaikun actually... Ariana bought a pair from us that she has been using on her stadium tour, so that's why! X
You holstered it well @taylorswift13! Loved our crazy creative 9 hours together. Nice one on becoming part of the @GRAMMYPro clan! Xx
Why am I not in bed? Go to bed Scout's mum! I panic if I'm not in bed by 11pm these days. zzz
Also, if you haven't seen it, @SonicCouture have done a really nice job of explaining what #BoxOfTricks is all about http://t.co/JnlndGokrn
@rahrahmaybe not really sure... need to catch up on all things #Mycelia when other things calm down end of this week. Need to assess! x
also.. in other 'mother' news... Scout is SUCH a cutie... we had a mega long bath this evening and life is just the bees knees with her. x
@TEDxCERN my absolute pleasure x

Massive thanks to the incredible musicians in my 'band'. Chris, Ros, Ellie, Oli + Ben. You're all awesome + it's been a total pleasure. X

@mattiryan really??? @radiusmusic @thelongdrop. We totally missed that then. Please give details!
@thealexandra_a @facebook Maybe they make bots too? What a weird world we live in! Fascinating! #SecretLifeOfBots.
@Funderballz @facebook aye! also... seems like emailing them, or contacting them via @Facebook itself has the same non effect!
Sorry to everyone who's getting these rather out of character posts from my @Facebook account. Dear hacker... one question...Why?
Dear @Facebook. I'm going to bed now but hopefully long before I wake up you'll have resolved my hacked account issues! Thanks!
Dear @Facebook. Seems Heap has been Hacked and all the admins are kicking us out. Help please! X
Thanks for the tweet alerts. Correct indeed, those Facebook posts aren't official. This is however ;) https://t.co/NOyJ1KWsje xx
@LloydDavis @leashless ha! Dyb dyb!
@leashless @LloydDavis it's the #tuttles of this world that help me sleep a little sounder at night! Xx
@leashless @LloydDavis Indeed! I like the idea that ratings for e.g. creativity, efficiency, clarity on our future 'profiles' could help.
@leashless @LloydDavis @shevski @redecentralize @ODIHQ @agentGav Great great great. Xx let me know if I can help. X
@LloydDavis @leashless oooooh I see sorry! Getting my wires crossed in the excitement (and no sleep). Looks like @leashless has an idea.
Rephrase! Does anyone have a London venue for this #Tuttle gathering on #Mycelia + more?   http://t.co/NONexzLt1o @LloydDavis @leashless
@leashless @LloydDavis Brilliant news!I'm there!  Does anyone in my twitter circle have a venue for this gathering? #tuttle #Mycelia
@M3metic @ChangeTip @TonySwish what a bizarre thing! To send me money to follow someone. I'd be rich if that happened everytime I did! X
@leithaus @Synereo thank you for getting in touch. I'll send you a DM about an event we'd love to have you involved in, if that's ok? X

Also been beavering away on Mycelia related things. #TinyHuman is set to have an interesting beginning online! Look forward to sharing more.
Rehearsing w/string players for the @Sennheiser_UK gig today in the barn. Gonna be some lovely arrangements of old favourites!! x
@buddymunro @Channel4 wonderful! I think @michaelLebor might hold you to that! I can play the panpipes while you work. Xx
Dearest @buddymunro! How are you still alive? Come and relax in our little village and soothe those aches + pains! @Channel4 #experimental

@frenchbloke yay thanks x Feels so good to air out the idea! You're reminding me I haven't got back to you about the #darkoutside!

But it's gonna be ok coz Scout's eating the socks from her feet when she's meant to be breastfeeding and that's funny
@ET_123 like the song doesn't snug for the box and the box won't wait.
Momentarily (about two days) lost my mojo. Wish I could have a mojito!   Mini winge at awkwardness of current project v family life
Grrr and double grrr

Yesterday @musicandsound + I visited my old boarding school in Saffron Walden to judge their music completion! Was awesome! Loved it! Xx
Busy mum /no time to shop for new clothes? Cut up too small baby socks for gloves and add 'cot toucan' (or similar)! http://t.co/LTPhDQ3H52
@rahrahmaybe @MiMu_Gloves definitely dabbling .. Mainly with vocal messings.
@fossto actually one of the pieces of this puzzle is it must have a string quartet for at least the intro (tying in with a live performance)
@AznBanjoPlaya Yes that usually does the trick for me too but unfortunately one is looming and so is a right old mess!
I am not finding songwriting easy :/ far too many options! Need to put my producer hat on and tell ms Heap to stop faffing about and choose
@amandapalmer ooh it's a hard initiation and once you're in you'll be broken and put back together 10x a day but boy the love gets bigger! X
Hello @amandapalmer @neilhimself !! So exciting you two wonderful peeps have a bump! Gorgeous photo Neil took too oooh la la! Beautiful Xx

Go team @MiMu_Gloves who are out there in Missouri for the Honeymoon tour! Thinking of you guys. Wishing I could be there too. @ArianaGrande

Off to bed as Scout's asleep but when she wakes us in a few hours @ArianaGrande will have debuted the @MiMu_Gloves on an arena stage! Woop!

@ShadupJoe @showballot yup... Micro heap at least one year old I think.... Crazy to think I was seriously gonna tour 6 months in!
@FinlyClean1214 arghhhhh help and Awww, she's adorable.
@energyUK Thing is the most counts get in... So it doesn't really work that well for lesser known songs :/ but it has been played live x
Hello twitter. I am alive. Currently watching Scout sleep learning my lessons of not to intervene when she wakes up fussing.
Actually @showballot. Almost every concert I've played over the last 10 years has had the setlist voted for by the audience in advance!
We had a visit from @Dezeen to our @MiMu_Gloves collaborator workshop weekend. Here's their sweet piece about it. http://t.co/7zsa2r0sFS
Nice piece on #SparksBoxset w/ @TheLongDrop. He's currently in LA in case we win @TheGRAMMYs for it! http://t.co/2gwSoSxlsa @KeyProduction
I guess it was a given, the first recording in the studio since Scout was born, would be her voice! Xx http://t.co/d94fcc51NC
hello! - Got confirmation from @avidprotools my desk is still supported. Anyone fancy it?  Clear The Desk - http://t.co/1cxr9roMx2

@GG1935 sure thing! I'll bring Scout too so she can see where her old ma got up to no good! Xx
I guess @ET_123 it's because @AvidProTools would like us to buy the new one? I would think twice if in 5 years it's obsolete!
Hey @AvidProTools I want to buy a new desk but I can't sell this ICON because you don't support it anymore. I'm £20k down! Ideas please!
@customversace @MiMu_Gloves that would be amazing if we could manage it. Need to figure out a plan! Feels like the time has come. Xx
@rahrahmaybe scout HAS a pair of @MiMu_Gloves ... More mimu_Mittens though :) courtesy of glove team for mamas birthday!

I hope Mr colic keeps at bay long enough for me to prepare + record my end of year blog! I've got a good one up my glove ended sleeve ;)
Skipped sleep to flick through lots of Scout photos. She's so cute (when not crying unless it's her adorable 'quivery lip' cry)!
Florence is most popular...  Ok... Now for last name! C - Florence Scout Rosie Lebor-Heap  D - Florence Scout Rosie Heap-Lebor  ??
B (Florence) is in the lead....  Baby daddy and me call her Scout but everyone who hears her name seems disappointed! Mmm
A - Scout Florence Rosie  B - Florence Scout Rosie A or B? Sitting in the registry office about to be called in! X http://t.co/U0ynvsRyL5

@eddyTM ooh! Glad you like it :) xx
@jpurdom amazing! Can't believe it's so poplar. Is a fab name ;) Maybe next time I visit the US, peeps'll know how to pronounce my name ;)
I find myself singing 'so lonely' by The Police, replacing it with 'so bloated' quite often after food these days. #BabyInBelly
Before I head back to some music making, I'd like to express the joy + comfort I experience from a hot cup of marmite, with a splash of milk
@TheHideawayTeam actually I was showing @TheLongDrop your site just today and we're gonna be in touch! Love it! Xxx
@emkappel thank you! can't wait to get started in there. Toilets, shower, electrics, floor paint, blackout blinds and kettle in 3 weeks :)

The barn is getting there! Should be ready for production rehearsals for #Reverb2014 @RoundhouseLDN in 3 weeks :) http://t.co/2zb9ePcS2Y
@MattLange probably mine too but not going to remake the song for radio. If people like it, they can hear again online + get a nice surprise
Radio stations can play the 4.5 min version if they're brave or if listeners complain! Xx
@me_the_machine I hear ya but it's not possible to reach new tempo/time sig feel in 3.5mins without it sounding clunky. Needs the build.
Was about to spend a long time on a clever #Run-Time radio edit but decided life's too short! 'Wish you well' bit will be a nice surprise! x
@PowJamie cool! Love it! Please forward to @thelongdrop as I'd love to link/add to my new website when the time comes :) xx
Going through a few old writing books, sticking post it notes for @eduardofitch to photograph pages… http://t.co/XEJ7dKXJpY

@MikeySignals I haven't I'm afraid. It's been quite mad. Barely time to sleep at the moment! Will do when I can
Also!! It's EXACTLY 3 years to the day I started #Sparks at 6am in my studio gathering sound seeds online with many of you! Woop!! X
About to get on a plane to visit the Pozzoli manufacturing plant near Milan to oversee the boxing up of #SparksDeluxe! Xx
Oh @marcusfairs! Was so lovely to have you over at the house :) Can't wait to see what you put together. See you at the Launch party! Xx

Today, ran 17.5miles, saw #DanceroomSpectroscopy @BarbicanCentre then donned my summing cossie for #WetSounds (concert in a swimming pool)!
You know that feeling... The one where your other half is soon to return from what seems like forever ago? I got it. 24 hours to completion.
Congrats to all @Limewharf on your 1st #FirstSaturdays! Great vibes + @Hackneychef cooking up a storm as always. Here's to more! Xx
@Hackneychef @jmfagerstrom @e2wharfkitchen @LimeWharf looking forward to hot salt beef and crocheted daffodils today! Xx

I'm bagging an early night. Sleep tight when it's your turn. *carries 3 hot water bottles + a mug of 'snore and peace' tea up the stairs* x
@MikeySignals sure... That'd be interesting to explore more. Can I do it in a bit? A little stretched at the moment. Info@imogenheap.com. Xx
@benfo cool! It's such a beautiful beast. You'll love it! See you at mine then? Xx
@stuball999 @musicinhospital oh wow stu! Email just came in from @Justgiving! Amazing and generous. Thank you! I'll run my socks off :) x
@ClefWolf I have thought about that as i'd rather 'give it away' than have it 'taken for free'. Xx
Always feels uncomfortable to sell my music but It is part of my job. Other musicians feel the same? Odd dilemma!
I find it much easier to ask you to sponsor me for @musicinhospital http://t.co/RbITQaVLsn than to ask you to buy/promote my album! X
It's become quite the norm to be running between meetings all around London as I fit in @LondonMarathon training! Crazy days! Xx
@AvecSans aw... You shoulda come said hello :) xx
Ooh! Just heard @Coldplay's Midnight after seeing the tweets. It's beautiful with a gorgeous video! Nice one @Jon_Hopkins_, Chris + gang!

Btw, that was the longest I've ever run in my life! 2.5hrs. @JulesHeap what are you doing to us??!! https://t.co/kMwHXuRvQc
Ran 17miles in glorious sunshine along the river w/ mountains as a backdrop. 'The hills are alive, with the sound of panting!' I &lt;3 Bern :)
@Ueney ahh... Which one comes first? To truly live to be able to truly love or love to live? Both in tandem... Inching forward together?
I've decided (for now) that the most precious thing in life is to be inspired by someone/something. Warm bursts of courage to truly live.
Thanx @mostlynoise for tuning me onto 'A winged victory for the sullen'. Perfect soundtrack for this train journey x http://t.co/P6anrryc0m
@energyUK I suppose yes... Exactly half! But actually all the songs are now spruced up and fiddled with a bit and work nicely as an album :)
I believe the same regarding my music being complete when you (the listener) experiences it. Dying to release #Sparks http://t.co/NlWzoi20CT

@clockworkniron no, I wasn't... Not for the death of a loved one. Was written accompanied by a feeling of emptiness or loss in another way.
@clockworkniron sorry to hear you lost him xx lovely to know the songs are giving you warmth. Xx thank you xx
Phew! That was a looong day. Making of docs of all songs are now complete thanks to Alex Goodman of Robur.tv! Sleepy time xx #SparksDeluxe

@BMB656 so true. Precious and fragile.
In a cafe in Seattle. Homeless guys pass the window. The contrast so stark between those that have + those that don't. Life can be so cruel

Kept hearing random clicks on the track i'm working on in the studio... couldn't figure it out... Then realised it's my darned watch!! Doh

Absolutely loving the new @Acehotel in London. 1st time since 17 I don't have a pad in London + feel an occasional 2nd home likely here :) x

@shiprara maybe I need to get out the house more! xx
@shiprara why... you think I get laid often? haha
@Talal_Chainsaw most people do anyway without asking. Generally fine unless there's money involved + someone's earning off me when I'm not!
can't wait for my new website to be up + running. Going to be an amazing community space for us all to share our creative works. x
Thanks everyone for the NY pic response. I think @thelongdrop and I are going with @Grismar's pic http://t.co/H8F8MbsXs2. Really works well!
@Grismar @thelongdrop amazing thank you! Have followed you so you can send me a DM x
@Grismar @thelongdrop can you zip the raw file? will the CRT work in Camera raw?
@Grismar @thelongdrop says 'the webpage is just listing the code rather than showing the picture'... can you upload a tiff or PSD?
@Grismar @imgur he says 'its the Jpegging that's the problem' not the resolution.
@Grismar @imgur this one is really working great! Do you have the original i.e. not heavily compressed? @thelongdrop and I really like it x
@LukasChase i do, yes. x
@jacqjacq88 @thelongdrop Do you have a high res of this?
@jacqjacq88 @thelongdrop not if we crop it out :) Nice colours... giving it a go.
@samklincoln nop sorry... thank you though. We need a bit of free floor space in the foreground to slot me into the picture. x
@DaynaR that's amazing, LOVE that you did that! GO Dayna! Trying this one. Was it super high res per chance? @thelongdrop needs to crop in.
@DaynaR ok... yup .. got that. Was this the only one? or are there more? Did you literally just whizz out and take this shot?!
@Grismar @imgur @thelongdrop says it's got potential... hang fire!
@JosephBayot not far off... only black and white... looking for colour... but it's a good angle... @thelongdrop will have a go and see now
@DaynaR can't see that for some reason....maybe it's uploading?
@Grismar @imgur k... cool. trying that quickly too.. xx
@Grismar @imgur lovely pic! Unfortunately the people in the foreground won't work with a 'glassy' me superimposed on it... Any more?
@instant_kitten cool :) @thelongdrop and I on skype at the moment... looking at this... he's giving it a go to see if it works in context :)
@behere_now for what we need.. it's not quite right. Lovely shot again though! xx
@behere_now lovely pics! We are looking for a colour pic we think and the other one you sent doesn't have enough 'floor' for me to stand on
Got a pic of New York streets from this angle? 300 dpi/ A4 print size. In the next 15 minutes? Free #SparksDeluxe!! http://t.co/NxI2v06seV

@mikesamillion94 you can still buy it and still meet me (special ticket gets you into a soundcheck).... So don't jump off just yet! Xx
Was listening to @majaratkje today. Wow! What a set of beautifully twisted pipes! The london underground became an adventure park :)

@jeffreymalott the version you have bought has everything and more but in different packaging xx

@ArianaGrande hello you. Thank you for the love. Xx
I'm off to go have a wee tipple with some nice folks now. A big relief to have #Sparks news finally in motion. PHEW! xx Love to you all! xx
Deluxe is expensive but not for what it is. I don't break even before 1800 sold. If I sell less than that, I lose money. #CrazyLady!
I was hoping it'd come out for my birthday (dec) but I went with team advice. EVERYONE thought it was suicide to release this side of xmas.
@aikimo have you seen the box set?? it's crazy! I still have a lot of work to do and don't want to release the album without the videos x
This should explain most things - http://t.co/c09xc6ACbC CAN NOT wait to get one of these babies in my hands. #LongTimeComing #Sparks!
#Sparks is the title of my new album. Release 3.3.14. Deluxe shipped 24.2.14. It's a monster! 100 early birds are coming to my house! WOO!
Lovely lunar enlightenments people xx It's magical here at Reid's Palace, Madeira. 100+ years of incredible stories. Xx decadence! xx

Re: mailing list announcement..We're double checking things. When you see what we are trying to do it'll make sense. It's quite complicated

Peaceful time @darkoutside. Ended up with @LesleyRankine aka Ruby, who's releasing another album after 12yrs! I heard one, sounded great :)
@sszdl @darkoutside So glad you heard it (and liked it)! Loving these ephemeral once-upon-a-time musical whispers in the trees. xx

#SoMuchSpam! Dr Oz get skinny quick tweets buzz off!

@ShadupJoe yes... 'a blip in the algorithm, a break in the cloud, soft circuits jumping' #MeTheMachine - new album, unreleased song :)
@kerrysharpe19 indeed! @Shazam are the underdog recording artist's friend :)
Today according to @twitter on my profile page I'm similar to @ryanSeacrest @JimmyFallon and @questlove. Curious algorithms!
@Lakester101 thank you :) and no... I didn't. What's the ESL exam? Xx
@rachee_lou @CASS_H0LE ha! gimme a break! I just finished an album! Last thing I want to do is go back into the studio. Xx
@rachee_lou definitely by the end of the year. I have a feeling it may be a 'special occasion day'... a gift to myself type thing ;) x
On train now back home from @SAM_Mastering. I'll return in a week with the final song + a running order and THEN I will be finished! Xx
@solobasssteve yes! I forget about the obvious sometimes! Aye... Could be wise :)
@energyUK nop! x
@Rammi maybe not... But it is still to me :) I'm not giving up now! Gotta be just right! There is a magic combination and I'll will find it!
I am literally fighting to stay awake though. U-turn from boundless adrenaline driven energy on overdrive last fortnight. May go for a jog!
The running order is such a delicate affair. It can conplete destroy/make the experience of the whole album. Attempt no.15!
So far so good! #MeTheMachine #Entanglement #ClimbToSakteng #CycleSong #XSK #NeglectedSpace #TheListeningChair + #YKWTFM all mastered :) xx
Loving it @SAM_Mastering! Tiredness from the crazy lead up to this has hit me hard. Feel like I've got jetlag! A wonderful tiredness though.
I'm eating a meal with other people and going to go to bed before the sun gets up. Definitely another phase! Xx
It's starting to dawn on me, that here begins the next phase of my life! Spongelike. I'm so ready to soak it up! To travel and be social :)
This is on my door here at Simon's! Apparently it's always there ;) xx http://t.co/7IBzp7l2DM
In great hands here at SuperAudioMastering with Simon Heyworth and his assistant Andy. So good to be… http://t.co/CsQY73IuVf
I've mixed every song apart from the end of #TheLlisteningChair (gonna take me a week to put that last 3sec line together from 634 samples!)
and he can slot it in later in the week.  Will do running order + spaces between songs. I've got a close 'rough' version of new song for ref
..... And also the 'new' song (track 14 :) as I felt it better to get everything else 100% done. Today will master everything but that...
Felt superhuman last night! Amazing flow in the studio!! Loved it loved it. The middle section in #MTM is now a completely different melody!
My car wouldn't start so Alex Goodman (filmmaker who was there filming my final moments last night) is driving us both down :) nearly there!
#TheListeningChair is now added to the DONE list :) Need to be at MAstering in Devon for 8am which is 10 hours from now and 4 hours drive! x
Have succumbed to sleep and have brought my head to rest on my pillow rather than where it was trying to rest, at the desk. Zzz for now x
@rahrahmaybe new ones :) x
@MimAbbyMason well... there are 600+ of these so will certainly take me a while as some are noisy too so will need to de-noise! x
@rahrahmaybe not quite yet! xx
well that was a slightly longer departure from mixing than I'd had in mind! All #WhoAmInow samples in computer + will cut up + sort later! x
Getting a spot of exercise in to give me energy for the next round of mixing while they're recording in :) http://t.co/48Ft2AW76c
how long do you think it takes 634 who am I now's to record into the computer? will let you know in a bit!
it's actually really amazing hearing them all strung together! Love that so many of you will be on this song :) x xx wooP!
634 who am i nows! Yowza, that's going to take me a weeee while to put together! ha... am now recording all the audio into my computer :) x
#MindsWithoutFear now has louder verse bass and additional kick/snare sound for definition. Somehow these 'little' things take hours! x
#Entanglement done :) I really love this song. Excited for you to hear when it finds your ears. Xx
Ok.... Just did a bounce of #YKWTFM with .5db on the vocals. Seems to be nice :) also... There was this weird 'clacky' sound in big section
@dec23k ha.. Weirdly you actually don't want to hear the kick.. When It was in, it slowed down the mix... The bounce is in the space left x
So I went completely overboard with #Lifeline's kick last night (this morning). I think I'd lost a little perspective perhaps! Back on track
@Garsh_its_Marsh actually it's still months away from being released but I will be finished in my studio with the mixes as of Monday. :/
Takes a while to wind down after mega mix session. Off for a helicopter ride (birthday present) in 5hrs! Find song order in the clouds? Zzz
Final #Lifeline mix. More kick and have doubled up the Marxophone part with @Soniccouture's extended piano so hear more note than rattle :)
Seems #Run-time was nowhere NEAR finished! New calmer middle section, simpler intro, de-essed + other bits and bobs. Made all the difference
All these 'who am I now' samples on @SoundCloud are AWESOME! Saturday night, I'll hit record to capture them one by one and have a wee cuppa
Very pro team of guys audio/visual guys here for @make stream. Kindly set up in a van so I could carry on working x http://t.co/GAMH1WRLFi
@StuHMusic ah thanks :) xx I'm nervous about #MeTheMachine. It's built up so much anticipation! Eek xx hope it 'delivers' xx
thanks so much everyone @make! Really enjoyed our session. Plus, always lovely to spend time in @ZoeCello's presence too :) 'til next time!
@googlescifair really enjoyed it :) p.s. Have not been nominated for an Emmy, I have won a Grammy and my nickname is immi xx
Argh! Unable to fit it. Massive wait to refund battery. 90 mins gone! Nightmare!
Amazing response on the soundcloud! You guys RAWK! Xx
Crazy day! Now at halfords getting new battery for car or else can't get to mastering Sunday night. Mental! Google gang at house prepping
@GeorgeBrooks3 ha! Awesome :)
I will use ALL the voices that get uploaded to soundcloud :) it is unlikely you'll actually 'hear' yours individually though! Xx
At the end of #TheListeningChair I say 'who am I now?', then voices echo them. Would love some more voices :) http://t.co/mRyYWTHdRh
@awjvail I've made it! Ha
3.5 hours sleep, 15mins mini trampoline, berry breakfast, add even more kick to #XSN (love the mix now, DONE!). Google gang here setting up!
Terrible timing on my part but I'm doing a google+ #makercamp session w/ @zoecello in about 12hrs but first, sleep!  https://t.co/Tlk69UKXv4
happy birthday dearest @backtednted! xx I wonder what delicious musical treats you've been cooking recently x will be in touch soon x
Last few days I've got glockenspiel melodica and OP1 into MeTheMachine. The Ax was used for some… http://t.co/5R7a7qfIHk
Bit disjointed for studio time today as outside world starts to creep back in. Hitting the Heap hay early for a head start tmw x night all x
@_Lovelight_ i'm still listening but I now have to really go to bed. it's great though. Have bookmarked :) x
@_Lovelight_ p.s. listening to you http://t.co/3ccIITWnQD enjoying. x
@_Lovelight_ touring next year... I come out often after. Come say hi x I have TWO of them!
Beginning of Me The Machine :) I never expected it to take me here but It's oddly machine dream perfect!  http://t.co/ZJrCTrtwCP
There's no song on the album yet that just comes in straight with the lyric....hmmmm.... gonna have a go...
a thought crossed my mind while eating my fruit salad. Perhaps #MeTheMachine needs its whole intro ditching + come in straight at the verse?
@Luke_Brown great :) well you're gonna love the new mix. Lots more bass in it :)
@AlanLorwhen ha! Damn you! ;) xx
@anuragshanker Everything I've musically been involved in past 2.5 years is connected to this album. It's by design, not an afterthought x
Ahh.. I don't know though actually... Erm... They all are like my babies. I feel bad having favourites. They change over time too. X
@GeorgeBrooks3 @DemeMeanie agreed! Bloody annoying!
Ahh lovin' it!! Thank you for the great feedback :) so happy it's a real mix of favourites! For me it's either #NS and #YKWTFM
The 7 songs are #Lifeline #PropellerSeeds #NeglectedSpace #MindsWithoutfear #XiziSheKnows #YouKnowWhereToFindMe #Telemiscommunications x
@bitbin hmmm... For me personally very important as a body of work but am all too aware maybe only 1% of people will listen as an album! X
Out of interest... What's your favourite out of the seven songs I've released already? Xx
I  am now going to go for a walk and form a new plan! Album won't be released now until November but you're gonna get an awesome extra song!
Decision is ... To spend a week extra on it then really enjoy this last stretch. Adding an extra song was a bit much so close to the end xx
Oh my GOD!!!!!! I've just slotted in some strings parts that Vince and Emma (aka geese, who toured with me) have recorded for me. Awesome!!
Oscillating between I'll manage it by Tuesday + needing another week! Another 24 hour day now sleep again for a few hours. Xx
So my plan is eat soup, sleep as long as possible, then go for a 59.5 minute long car ride to listen to mixes so far. Long album for me :) x
argh! ok... i didn't go to sleep but I did write the verse lyrics for the new song! ON A MEGA ROLL! xxx
Gonna take me a couple of days to follow its lead. Very surprising! Can't wait for you to hear! (if I keep it!) I really have to go to bed!
well... I never in a million years expected #meTheMachine to take me there! The chorus sounds like you've walked into a french cafe! xx
@wickwox actually not recently. It's a bit flat.... Maybe should switch back though these next few days to stop this happening x
@wickwox oh yeah! Not good :/  Should go down hopefully now I'm going to go to sleep. (at midday? Body clock screwed!) x
@MarkRosenbauer good point :) x
@wickwox what's that stand for?
A breakthrough with #MeTheMachine. Time to let the live version stay the live version (#theGloves) + studio version be the studio version!
My ankles are completely swollen from being in the same spot mixing/re-recording in a 12 hour marathon mix. Didn't even go to the loo!
If you're out there Jason, thank you for the beautiful bunch of flowers and note! Awkwardly just found it wasn't from my gardener Jason! x
I didn't to bed, I got excited about some last minute string parts for #CycleSong + the 'new' one. This is madness of course! 4 days to go!
Got 2.5hrs sleep last 'night' (11.30-2pm). Getting to bed a bit earlier now at 9am! alarm set for 1pm. Let's see if I can get out of bed x
Here's the latest todo list. 3 big ones left. #MeTheMachine, some strings for #CycleSong and a 'new' song! ;) x http://t.co/nk8noY68AI
Spent the whole day mixing #TheClimb. Am using a new EQ. Thanks to Tommy @WavesAudioLtd help centre for suggesting it :) #RS56 = amazing!!
My to do list has more 'done!'s on it now which is deeply satisfying! Am going to get some breakfast now before bed. http://t.co/z1j1aOdLtU
Goodness me! 11 hours straight in the mix! #XiziSheKnows sounds bloody brilliant now and #Run-time too. #Entanglement tweaked also...
Bedtime! My to do list has so many little bits to fix. Want to get all but the last two done by wed afternoon. Eek! http://t.co/7PjNkuTumW
Well that was unexpected... Thought #NeglectedSpace was a quick fix but it appears not! Feels much more dynamic now to me... Yay! x
#Lifeline sounds way better but maybe even a tad more bass + piano. Currently beefing up #NeglectedSpace + resinging 'Stop in the...' vocal
@thebigmushroom likely yes :) x t'was I! X
Off to bed for me xx love to you all. Sleep good and tight when you get there and that our brains fix the day during the night.
@dmarklein I'm a terrible friend! I'm lucky to have any at all. I don't see them for months or years at a time!
#XiziSheKnows #Entanglement + #ClimbToSakteng are to be tested in car stereo tmw. Thx for all sweet messages re: split. It comes in waves x
@DavidJayB ha! Slivers! Do I not say that? Doh! Was going to redo small bit but problems recalling that mix. Old plug-ins...will attend to!
#propellerSeeds Tick, and #xiziSheKnows sounds TONS better now. It's got drums and bass you can actually here and the guitar is up x
@CarlCaspersen pair of Focal twin6 Be x
@Saheer_D well done...
@energyUK I think it may just be the very few that will notice the difference... But yes... Little things here and there am tweaking.
@ImJonnyPrice yup... sure do
@Saheer_D hello? Er ... Yes
Back to #propellerSeeds... I went a bit overboard on the new kick drum in chorus 2 on remix... But otherwise good :)
@solobasssteve I hand draw in every ss, f, t, ch! Anal or what?!
#Lifeline now has some kick drum in it! What was I thinking? Also failed to de-ess original mix successfully. Airier in m8 section.
Had a listen to all mixes so far in the car. Lots of work to be done! Gonna catch an early night after a spot of #miniTrampoliningB4bed xx
Everything's fine and we're still friends. Just particularly today it hit home for me. So there we go! Heap is single xx back to the mix xxx
Last mix on #PropellerSeeds. Seems like a good time to mention that Thomas and I broke up 2 moths ago. Wasn't quite ready to tell peeps then
#MeTheMachine to finish by this saturday but it's Sleep for Heap now. Sleep well when it finds you x love x
@rahrahmaybe I'm going to take it with me on a little trip and spend some quality time with it :) x good news on the online version! Fab &lt;3
@Jashuan ha! Yeah, that probably wouldn't have been so good! Xx :)
@rahrahmaybe @sntnvmbr exciting! Looks great :) can't wait to get mine. Xx
@LukeHollandd ha, thanks :) more soon! Can't waaaait to have it finished! Yaaaa... Just saw your bittersweet @elliegoulding drum mix. Sweet!
Now heading into town, wearing a lovely summer dress with no sleep under my belt but it feels like an adventure :) closer, closer every day!
Argh! The 'other' track for @HappiestFilm sound amazing! So bloody exiting! Result from 20hr through the night marathon studio session!! :D
@Forthaven1 so great to hear Julian! Xx congrats x
@billmason @MimAbbyMason thanks guys. Literally life changing. Had no idea. Thought I was just always gonna feel tired! Xx
3 to 4 hours a night will eventually catch up with me, especially as its daytime sleeping from long nights in the studio. Sleeeeep take me!
I'm waking up much earlier than my 8 hour alarm, feeling oddly refreshed.  Turns out I was anaemic/now taking iron syrup/what a difference!!
On a roll!! The second piece of music that's going on my new album from the Bhutan trip + @happiestfilm is strangely rocking! #result!
@rahrahmaybe @streemliner yes :)
@lextaylor907 exactly ;) x
@cmilette there are 11 songs + 2 non lyrical pieces. There is gonna be the most amazing deluxe version. More on that soon xx
@lextaylor907 possibly... But I haven't really thought about it. I like 'spark' x
have finished #Climbing (working title/connected to the Bhutan film) and another tmw. These'll both work as nice segways in the album x :)
Studio break 4 fish supper, hopped on http://t.co/a3nZzDepPP, stumbled on @TomThummer's WICKED talk! Check it!! Lovin' the UK heatwave too!
I'm back off into the dungeon to continue working! Wish me luck! Countdown! arghhhhhhhhhh!!
@GIJoeCake I hope it or another song doesn't have to do it again x Stay up! x
oh yeah.... And there's vinyl in it too! Sooooooo exciting!
and (last and) that's why I had my chef's hat on. More soon on what's been cooking. Meantime, slinky! http://t.co/M7xmKHk2BR
And... if you're wondering how the hell all that is going to fit into one CD, it's not! That's why I'm making a Deluxe album box set :)
and I'll be taking @roburtv (who never tweet!) with me to film it. Then all music vids, artwork, making ofs + packaging. mid Sept deadline!
I've booked my album mastering session for 6th August for with Simon Heyworth. Full steam ahead to finish now!  http://t.co/pdO6GXmQcE
@Colorsfm Hello! Great to hear you're playing me on the radio over there! I look forward to coming back. Hello to any Heap fans listening x
In Bristol for #HelloLampPost launch, I enojoyed talking to a postbox + a lamppost. http://t.co/dFPMI8GaeM Give it a go if you're in town x
@whereishawkins ha! No time for that.... Yet ;) x
Hello all xx for those asking. Release date will be announced next week. Also something else special I've been working on for 2.5 yrs :) x
@jherekbischoff lovely to meet you too and thankyou for the album. Haven't managed to listen to it yet but looking forward to. Xx
@djBraniac thankyou! I loved that and hadn't seen it before. Beautiful! Xx
@matty0828 what comes after is one of my favourite bits on the whole album :) xx
@Lakester101 yes I have, it's great! Xx
@mySpacecraft I know all about it! Question is.. Which option to get? :) I will be getting one though! Seb and I were talking about it. X
Red bull soap box race!! Awesome!!!' xxx wanted to come to this for years :) xx https://t.co/pSZzJBt8Xr
Run-time bits... There's lots of others :) L.O.V.E this song!! https://t.co/BM3800nWGc
+ that was the most creative, hilarious retort I have ever witnessed! @AmandaPalmer, I salute you! C U Sunday :) http://t.co/86F9wtPbT0
Wow @AmandaPalmer! beautiful, funny, candid. Last night a triumph. Loved lyric 'low res copies' from the penultimate new song in context.
@0xjf mmm, that would be weird to have my daughter called imogen not to mention saying yes to a total stranger but it's nice to be asked :)
@0xjf i hope its a girl! xx
Ha! Imogen is no.1 US girl's name from not ever being in the top 1000? It's pronounced i-mo-gin (i also as in gin ;) http://t.co/fiSPxLRFnD
Euphoric @TimExile as @Jamie_Lidell jams brilliantly w/ #TheMachine! Can't wait to get my mitts on one Tim! Amazing! http://t.co/FFK3Zk6rpS
A bit of insight on that #ChefHeap pic I posted! http://t.co/svOFYKOpNw   http://t.co/Cb08fX9JoF p.s. still writing that article!
Went to turn off the light before sleep but turned it on instead. I'd have to turn off the sun to have the expected outcome in drowsy state
@rahrahmaybe nop... That was something entirely different! All will be revealed/served up #chefheap xx
I don't want to jinx it until i get the green light but am very excited about the whole thing! So enjoyed swatting up. Want to do more x zzz
I feel like I'm back at school researching + writing (my first commissioned article :) all through the day + night. Sleep time 4 fresh eyes!
@SirClownish nice!
@cajunjoel ah yes! http://t.co/qTjyxYEXCg indeed inspired this one! x
Me, having a moment while I was 'working' the other day. Captions welcome! #ChefHeap http://t.co/y547Fvrp6c
“@johncrossley01: 5.1 ambisonic mix of Imogen Heap's 'You know where to find me' very well received at #soundsinspace” great!! Xx :)
.@twitter really needs to sort its spambots out. Dr Oz, garcinia, Kim kardashan's new dress? Why? A strange world we live in sometimes.
Now't like a bit of @SirKenRobinson to start your week off positively @RSAEvents. Education boiled down to its essence. My mind is buzzing
I've a full day of Monday meetings. Starting first one in 5 hours so had better get some sleep! It looks to be another fine day ahead :D Zzz
Yeeeeeeeesssss! #Run-time is ready for its final mix. That was a marathon song! Feels like the start of the new me finishing writing that ..
Argh!!! That is all (testing if venting frustration amplified via twitter has more effect.... will report back). #DAWmeltdown
#hellolamppost is going live 15th July, Bristol. I'm looking forward to chatting with a lampost :)  http://t.co/CldV7gCb3H @PlayableCity
Dear @Mostlynoise (part of glove team) + his fab @rumourcubes have a @kickstarter. I got granular synthesis workshop http://t.co/pVit1piDDb
keeping in theme with lots of voices, have been reminded how good this cover of #HideAndSeek is! So much work! https://t.co/nGFviJKOfK
Much enjoyment was had last night @voicesnow @RoundhouseLDN. Congrats to all for putting on a great show + thx to those who came to watch us
Beautiful @Zoecello concert tonight in St Giles' church. Almost home when 9 horses and a police car in hot pursuit took the road before me!
Bat + fly now out of my bedroom. Need my beauty sleep as I'm spending the day with @GuySigsworth tmw for a photo shoot in Dungeness :D Zzz x
@AshRatcliffe_92 I wouldn't have let him go so easy!
@AlexaKido No windows were open before it got dark. Odd...Now there's a fly in room! I won't need the hat for that
There was a bat in my bedroom, frantically flapping around! I put on a bowler hat (i've had one fly in my eye before) to open the window..
Yup @jowhiley, come next six months I'm making an app with @RJDJ on a jogging app that changes with the pace of your run.
Thx @fLip_uk. Yup @jowhiley, I'm making a running app with @RJDJ. Here's a short video explaining what it will be http://t.co/6hsCAAkeuS xx
Today listened to your 'Closing In' cover for approval @thisisBURNS only to find you'd already put it up! Why ask? http://t.co/k18d33Gw7u
Ok, enough Frankie time, time for #Run-time! I feel a @vineapp addiction coming on. Xx Love to you all... Back to the dungeon for me! X
Lalala la ... Wait! I smell... PEANUTS! https://t.co/21ep0MyAb4
I am a singing fox and my name is Frankie https://t.co/WUC37kHDeq
p.s. first signing appearance in a while for @VoicesNow next Sunday @RoundhouseLDN. I'll be the singing narrator! http://t.co/Tz04NsNOj9
@simondh @BurmanBears boom boom! I think perhaps very very distant relation...
@simondh no he's OK...just transfixed currently by nearby needle and thread. Maybe they remind him early days with @BurmanBears?
My new pal Frankie the fox, keeps me company as I make a little card for Dad. Xx http://t.co/VTZSsvM9Fe
Went to see the wonder that is @Jon_Hopkins_ play tonight. You simply must all go and buy his new album Immunity or you lose! X
Hello :) Lots been happening at Heap central! Just wrapped up the video shoot for #TheListeningChair song. Can't wait for you to see! Xx
@argiemj Jogging app probably not until next year. Album hopefully October time x
@Sinj1 I have plenty! Xx Today is heading in the 'on' direction x
@LJAfrica I hope I'm right too! Am going through my own Heap! Yeesh. Xx we can do it! X
I am currently dancing around my studio (When no-one's looking at you type dancing) to #Run-time which is turning out to be a corker! Xx
I must remember to listen to music more often, as the mayflies in my garden dance to @apparatofficial's 'A Violent Sky' on this fine day xx
@syriahbailey @RoundhouseLDN Can't wait to see what you guys come up with! xx #RHPuffball xx
@alexwtw  Agreed! Was a lovely evening! Good to meet you + your better half. I feel well at truly like part of the @RoundhouseLDN family :)
Goodnight all xx hope you sleep good when you get there x
@gordonabishop but you will have option to come and pick up from me direct and or come to a soundcheck so could sign then? Xx
@gordonabishop :/ not sure I'll have the energy to sign all of them! Limited 2,500 of these babies :) they are extremely special though! Xx
In 8hrs, team comes to film me describing the rather amazing deluxe album box set that'll be up for pre-order soon :) #beautysleep!
#entanglement pretty much finished now :) Then straight into figuring out #Run-time chorus (I came back down to switch the computer off!) x
Had the most incredible 90 mins with @AlanMartyn @musicandsound and @laurencegreed in a big empty basement. Voices, brooms, hand dryer etc
@kellysnook I do...or at least I did...
#Entanglement is coming along nicely. Turns out I just needed an all nighter to get stuck into more orchestration for the mid section. Zzzz
@AshRatcliffe_92 @thomyorke agreed! That would be something xx
@AlquaQ you can see all of what we're doing if you go to our website http://t.co/bRSDqkNWuR xx tons of documents and designs x good luck!
@sntnvmbr can I have a couple please? ;) Xx Very excited to have Speak For Yourself on vinyl! Thanks so much!!
Anyone in London fancy a LOT of choir action on 23rd June? I'm the singing narrator (and part moon?) for this. http://t.co/USvdASIP34
Burning a CD of 12 #Heapsongs to listen in car + drive to a nice park on this beautiful sunny day :) Some songs more finished than others.
Am off to bed. Night all. Sweet dreams when it's your turn. Speaking of dreams, I saw 'Brazil' for the 1st time last night. #Amazing! &lt;3d it
@rahrahmaybe nop! Had managed to completely put it out of my mind. The time is fast approaching to need it though.... Domino effect. Xx
@M_D_Witt a wee nudge here and there. At one point there's 10 tracks of mbira so needed quite anal timing x
@chuckrogersjedi at some point this year... Toward September... But to be taken with a large pinch of salt. X
Ooh that chord led to many places including a rabbit hole. Was a fun trip! #MeTheMachine = 99% done. Sneaked some mbira in among machines.
@adriansutton @guysigsworth @jon_hopkins @jamieliddell ooh! I am in good company there. All these guys make me do that too! #NoNailsHeap
@matty0828 so answer is unlikely before the album xx
@matty0828 I need to make the video first and that ain't gonna be easy. Connecting gloves up to 3D visuals :) Will be the start of tour rig.
Been beavering away on what I thought was final mix day for #MeTheMachine when this total curveball chord came in and got me all excited! x
@budhammers I am having similar thoughts. Amazing really! I've been one version of me for so long. Am ready to unlock some other ones ...
IMy mostly trusty @Jawbone #UPband thinks playing the piano for 3 hours amounts to 5,034 steps! Xx Wandering for the mind....
Had a mad 3 hr session jamming on piano making weird noises with my voice. Not often I get the house to myself :) Good thoughts came from it
I would absolutely indeed, love to @zachbraff xx
I just noticed how extremely hungry I am! Time to get cosy with a spoon and some peanut butter before bed. Night all xxx
while I was 'in the zone' our behind the scenes for #Telemiscommunications video got uploaded :) http://t.co/pl1LPkH3Z6 Enjoy! @Deadmau5
Yay to @zachbraff's next movie WISH I WAS HERE on @Kickstarter http://t.co/rXbyilQmUD - I got a Toronto screening ticket. Can't wait! x
Hello...  I've been beavering away in my wee studio this week on #MeTheMachine and getting some walks in the sunshine. Daffodils aplenty x
@SchumacherAaron you can. We are going to be making 300 pairs for kickstarter campaign before the end of the year. Look forward to hearing x
Ok.. I think I've put #TheListeningChair 'to bed'. 4 to go! #MeTheMachine #Entanglement #Run-Time and the instrumental piece from Bhutan. Xx
@rahrahmaybe family time... :) more travel and study x
Mixing #TheListeningChair is rather tedious! So many vocals = lots of gremlins like mouth clicks, pops and tons of delicate de-easing! Xx
@LupeFiasco well then! Xx Let's keep in touch :) xx
I meant to mention, online searching my lyrics, I found my name in a @LupeFiasco song. My first shoutout! thank you :) #FormFollowsFunction
Hope you all had/are having a lovely day. #Run-Time + #TheListeningChair coming along nicely and I'm getting to bed before 9am! Woo! x
@rahrahmaybe Yup. definitely need list of songs/lyrics on there. I was thinking of 'Bite sized lifeboats, I'll fix your smashed up head' x
@ProjectAIP that's not true actually. I wrote songs as early as 5 but being bullied at boarding school certainly helped my songwriting!
Searching If I'd used 'quick fix' in a song b4/ not to repeat myself. So many incorrect lyrics everywhere! e.g. http://t.co/RrGMDmigcL :/
8.30am. Back in the small hours for music in the studio. Been on a bit of a lyrical (and singing 'em in) roll. I'm liking #Run-time. Xx
@CCOMCREATION @3DiCD is now called @streemliner aka Andy Carne. Xx
@JonathanAngwin am currently asking myself that question. Should i leave as is, or tweak a bit (namely redo some vox/sort bass) for album? X
@hausofdavid not now... But soon xx
@M_D_Witt read that wrong.. It won't be released before the album I don't think as I can't find the cash to make the video I want. X
@M_D_Witt had a listen to that too today and decided the studio version's not all that bad :) another few days it'll be ready for the album.
Finished #TheListeningChair lyric today. Was never quite happy with the final section. A few months break from it was just the thing :)
@Tim_Hilberts Hello. Just heard your Half Life cover. It's lovely Tim and fuelled me for another day in the studio Xx love and thanks xx
I LOvE my UP band. I've slept 7-8 hours every night for the past 3 weeks (unheard of) and walked EVeRywhere. Nice work @jawbone! Top tech!
Incredible mind blowing night thanks to @GuySigworth and Ryoji Ikeda's #Superposition @BarbicanCentre. Again again! Xx
Went to see #DannyBoyle's #trance tonight with my sis @julesheap at the Barbican. Wow! Loved it loved it. Dark, sexy, twisted, great story.
I forgot how much I love people watching and reconnecting with dear old friends. I should do both more often.
@afoundsound @rbma_r7l @rbstudioslondon Loved jamming! thanks so much @timexile. Always happy to tweet while you tweak ;) see you soon xx
@balleyne nop. Never heard it before but still. Time for another line.
@Guy_Garvey Thanks! Will do xx
@Paulhitsheet that was weird. I'd recorded that way before I heard the 'other' one. must have been in the ether. We plucked it out
@Guy_Garvey ha! hmmm... this is the last song on the record, I thought I had it covered! Maybe deep down it could have been better anyway
@Guy_Garvey ha! What did you do? Keep it/ ditch it?
@Artylad yes, it does on this occasion I fear.
boo! The moment when you find another song featuring a set of almost identical words you'd just written for a chorus! #DrawingBoard&lt;=
So enjoyed piano noodling for those of you who tuned in. It's up now on @Ustream http://t.co/CCuACYRoHU   #EarthHour2013 g'night all x

@HaifaaMansour @birdseyeviewff yes yes yes! Xx and you too... Loved to hear you talk about it on stage. Congrats.

@tommayye we are planning to do a kickstarter this year sometime. Will keep you posted. Maybe sign up at http://t.co/bRSDqkNWuR for news? X
Spent my #IWD13 eve @BIrdsEyeViewFF + saw Wadjda by Haiffa Al-Mansour. 1st Saudi Arabian film by a woman! Insightful, touching, a wonder :)

yes! I heard about @amandapalmer amazing TEDtalk but haven't watched yet. Looking forward to it!!  http://t.co/ioQ8NRQltK @MimAbbyMason :)
Hello! Am back in the land of tweet. Landed fresh from Hangzhou now to Hackney. Was a really great week. What did I miss? hope all's well x
but first... I forgot! Sleep. I need to sleeeeeep a wee bit. xx I am so excited to go back and see everyone. xx
Finished #XiziSheKnows Mandarin version, tested mobile studio, found pics for exhibition, now to pack clothes for Hangzhou trip no.2! :D
bedtime. Favourite lyric today is 'I say that I'm working but I'm searching on youtube, for an emergency guru' #Run-Time possible lyric
@Nylons ...leading to more words we didn't know... leading to more words we didn't know! argh!
@Nylons my dear dad's dear dad. Involved reading the newspaper (which i also fear) + looking up words we didn't know...
That idea blossomed while jamming video ideas with  Rod Temperton (the guy who wrote Thriller, it wasn't MJ), which is pretty cool :)
@rahrahmaybe yup, maybe to prove I can do it? Articulate myself on some level at least. I don't say 'er' in songs :) (maybe I should once..)
I wanted make a crowd sourced video of people dancing to my version of #Thriller with what they fear on the screen in text. #Still may do.
force fed the dictionary put the fear of words into me : came out during scribbling. it's one of the reasons I write songs I think
Indeed! Been waiting to! #ifihadglass I'd hook them up w/my gloves to help me navigate music making in 3D http://t.co/gjbkaDXumH @vincentgr
Oh wonderful, thanks for the tip @ianshepherd! http://t.co/AGSrBwXFnW @NeilGaiman I'm now going to Make Good Art! *scuttles over to piano*
@solobasssteve too true. Perhaps the final song with nudge me to ask it more often outside of music. Easy to lose track.
@ianshepherd @laurawasylyshen @neilhimself not yet! Will check it out. Thank you x
@solobasssteve well said. Which is probably why I find myself asking it today again. To bottle into a song feels like a good challenge :)
@ianshepherd hmmmm... Interesting idea... Mulling over
@ImJonnyPrice I've kind of got my work cut out for me already. Soz! X
@LauraWasylyshen like you said also...it leads to happiness. Though perhaps easy to depend on it too much for happiness?
@LauraWasylyshen yes, art but the behind that? To connect, to be loved, to share a truth, to break oneself again + again? All of the above?
After many pages of scribbling i've come to ask 'Why do I really do half the things I do during my #Run-Time. My life. What's at your core?
Album needs a plain'n'simple song but #Run-time is multiple tempos! Perhaps a combo of 6/8 + boost feel? Thoughts? http://t.co/i9CFy1pF
Scribbling away with coffee and hubbub accompaniment... In the distance llamas are necking each other in the Essex countryside.
@jgrasett @alejodorowsky i haven't seen it yet no. I know, i know. I will soon.
Hello all! Found myself watching a ton of @alejodorowsky videos these past few hours, setting me up nicely to begin final album song lyrics!

@timexile steady Tim! A most pleasurable and inspiring evening spent with you my dear and for sure..fond words spoken for @Beardyman xx
@FroyaMusic hmmm... We went through a few iterations. First one was almost a different song. Does it really not work you think?
#XiziSheKnows it's not getting any easier! Here's where i got to w/fixes some of you suggested :) http://t.co/HZD8IHWX Sleep for Heap xx
@ShowmetheHue Have changed :) thank you x Chorus coming up soon x
@adepated you're right! Thank you x have changed them :)
@jeanhollywood great! Thank you and to your stepmum xx :) x
@MisisipJns Ooh, love how it translates back! Pang Wei is a poet from Hangzhou who translated it for me after some long discussions. xx
@MelLynnR I didn't realise I hadn't! That's good! It means something at least can come as a surprise :) soz... Gonna make you wait ;) x
@maripaiz good point! Xx not an easy one! Xx

The school I went to was The BRIT in Croydon from 15-17yrs old. The song I was talking about is 'Missing You'. It's on YouTube somewhere x
@jordylass ha! I think I did once have a purse like when i was about 22 that but I didn't go to SummerHill. Not sure where that is. Odd! Xx
Going 'old school' on the piano practicing a song I wrote/recorded at 16 for a talk/Q&amp;A later with current students of school I went to. Xx

@Palomadawkins hello there. I will see if I can find him. He's likely up in the highlands looking for rabbits! Xx
Exciting! So many of you have requested #SpeakForYourself + instrumentals. Here y'are! Lossless + artwork http://t.co/zGHHefKY

@alexamelines phew! that was a close shave!
@Gurwic what's it like on the other side? Same? Lights still on?
I forgot about the world ending tomorrow. I guess I don't need to wash my hair. Is that 21/12/12 GMT or have I got a few hours still?
For those who'd rather not watch #JoggingApp video via facebook here is direct link. https://t.co/9aKpkWjA
@keithpp https://t.co/9aKpkWjA You can also watch it here (and Earth day on my website). I do what I can when I can x
@keithpp agreed. I don't really like it either. It's tough to make your way in this music game. I'm sure you can imagine what I mean.
Another #joggingApp vBlog. http://t.co/hMcHh0ai Some little beginning sounds from my studio + trying stuff out with @DizzyBanjo @RJDJ #intel
#joggingApp song is now officially called #Run-time :) xx
Btw... Excited to announce I'm curating Reverb festival Aug2014. Heap head on the loose! Trust me, put in diary/pencil in a trip to London!
Here @roundhouseLDN checking out view from the rafters, lightly bouncing on the springy mesh. #Reverb2014  http://t.co/1KfrwyQ6
morning! A little time lag on these vblogs but here's another re: #joggingApp from @DizzyBanjo + I. #intel. #ultrabook https://t.co/HhAQZaBn
I need to sleeeeep as Angela (my PT) is coming to kick my butt in 4 hours and my butt still hurts from last training session! x
cracked it! #joggingApp currently at 120/160bpm (will be variable either side) with 6/8 segways. @DizzyBanjo can't wait for you to hear!
Yes @jake_tweet - It has chords also written in. #YKWTFM
@RaphaelSacha p.s. nice mini array mbira! xx
@RaphaelSacha Wow, that was fast! You're right! Drat! It doesn't even exist on the keyboard I played it in with so doubly annoying!
Re: #YKWTFM sheet music. If you get it/play it, let me know thoughts. Also, I should have mentioned it's for voice + solo piano.
Selling my 1st ever sheet music! I arranged it for one piano (not 20 as on recording!) http://t.co/gvWutG2a #YouKnowWhereToFindMe
@asgriffith digital. I forgot to tweet about it! Xx
deeply liberating to think that eventually this 'piece' wiinterior in multiple tempos. @dizzyBanjo will need many a cup o'coffee for this!
Ooh! May be chewing off a bit much as wide variable tempo is of course a can of worms! It's a very different piece of music at 155bpm. Hmmm
.@M_D_Lewis You'll be happy to know, we're on it! :) xx
.@scandifox Exactly! @DizzyBanjo worked on the inception app which is who I'm doing this with. He/they are fab. I'm a fan! @RJDJ
.@lizzie_hudson that's the plan. You change the bpm. Tricky to write music with a variable tempo!
I like to hear my breathing/sounds around. @DizzyBanjo + I are experimenting with the mic input being effected/turned into music.
@Hanna_Preston not sure to be honest. I don't listen to my own music but this piece will change on every listen/jog so perhaps?
@live1052 I do that often. :) half the time, I 'fix' musical problems in the studio during a jog! X
@rahrahmaybe nop! Strangely I rarely listen to music full stop.
I love jogging + music but I can't listen to music when I run, which is why I like the challenge of making a #JoggingMusicApp x
Joggers/runners. If you listen to music while exercising, do you tend to run on the beat or not. Does your jog change speed with the tempo?
That was very helpful! 118 - 172bpm roughly. Fave tempos around 120-150. Hmm... food for thought! #JoggingApp @RJDJ @DizzyBanjo
out of interest everyone... if you do jog... what's your favourite jogging tune? #JoggingApp @rjdj @dizzyBanjo
Wow! Cool! Tons of great cheering on the @soundcloud page :) http://t.co/8ZZMGAzV Thanks all! Perfect! Exactly what I need xx
Choosing animation choices with @waltorangeboy for #Telemiscommunications video. We hope to be getting in touch today with people! Xx
Look! @DizzyBanjo is being Klonged :)  http://t.co/epGyw8O0
@HarrisonWeber @tnw sounds good! Info@imogenheap.com :)
Anyone have any questions/thoughts for me on the jogging app? Will film some responses for next weeks vblog xx
+ Really enjoyed meeting Gawain from @Sensum. An emotionally interactive + reactive music project for me soon I think! :) #1thing@atimeHeap
S'been a good day. Time for some shut eye. Men with cameras in the AM to film @DizzyBanjo + I on #JoggingApp progress. Which is substantial!
p.s. You're not cheering me on specifically as you'll be helping others keep going on their jog too! xx #joggingApp
Thanks for #joggingApp cheering samples (solo or crowd is good). Still need a few more. Anyone else? http://t.co/ETOmT3Ag x
Would love samples of different people cheering for the #JoggingApp. Can anyone record 5secs of for me? http://t.co/ETOmT3Ag :) xx
@PBalent cool! :)
Fancy sending me sounds of you cheering? Each 1k/mile jogged, the app will congratulate you. Need many different ones! http://t.co/a0QDxiPh

@DisneyVidder a couple... Not set on any though x Time enough still.
Feels good with over 1/2 the album released now! #Lifeline #PropellerSeeds #NeglectedSpace #MWF #XiziSheKnows #Telemiscommunications #YKWTFM

@deEscalate if played on a pianoforte :) mostly a piano piano for this pianoforte number. X
Who'd have thought 'the piano track' on the album would be such a pain! #YKWTFM now has yet another section/change. Running out of dayZzzz
@themusicalbrain looks good :) thanks for the heads up. Maybe see you there xx
@ruthmoog loved it! Xx I was all in a raced muddle before the show (as you found me) and was transformed post show! X
Last night I saw #DESH @Sadlers_Wells. Stunning, otherworldly. Am floating from it still. Beautiful work @AkramKahnLive xx
Today I had lunch at 10.30pm and am now going to bed (8am). Slightly skewy work schedule. I ripped apart #YKWTFM once again. Zzz
Hoping to release #YKWTFM Oct 15th (a little later than planned). I should plan in plans, that plans often happen later than planned. Zzzz
Just played #YKWTFM 5 times in a row really loud in my studio which means, I like it (A LOT. In a delirious 6.30am all nighter kinda way)! x

I'm so rubbish! Also just realised now coming online that I just missed the paralympic games closing ceremony.
@JamesSweeneyy @deadmau5 maybe he will :)? I'd love that.
@MisterManny SOUND quality is amazing and people are totally loving it, even if he is 'pressing play'. Love that he tells it like it is too.
I should BEEEEEE there not in my studio!! I need to get my priorities in order! 1 day @Deadmau5 you + me on stage #telemiscommunications
OK, I admit, I'm now not ripping up piano tracks but watching @Deadmau5. Looks amazing online! So awesome on my big studio speakers too!
Watching a bit of @Deadmau5 rip it up at #iTunesFestival online from my studio while I rip up endless piano tracks. Go Joel!
However, It was absolutely lovely to meet everyone and have the memory and stories of each person/piano connected to #YKW2FM.
Recording #TKW2FM on a dozen different pianos/in a hurry/song unfinished may not have been my brightest idea! Editing = nightmare. Argh!
Gorgeous! RT @GuySigsworth I just posted this piece of clavichord pr0n http://t.co/inxhMktY

Delirious. Sleepy time. btw.. I have a rather badly infected foot. Another trip to the doctor's as it's still twice the size of the other!

I forgot! Message for Australian's! By a TV now? My playlist for @rageabc is on. Lots of love went into that, hope it goes down well :)
@wilfulblindness More variety the better! Please send email to piano@imogenheap.com with location and pic of piano in room. Cheers :)
@erinevenight nice! I didn't think I'd see them there! Good words to carry you through life's battles though :) xx
Any more Edinburgh homes/locations w/ pianos in for me to sing #YouKnowWhereToFindMe - 30/6/12? email piano@imogenheap.com
Happy, busy here with #TheListeningChair #TheGloves and prepping for #TEDGlobal. Small threads of sunshine at last, that was a lot of rain!
@cherade9 that was a bit of a hasty reply. On second reading I assume 'lovely piano' is a real one xx hope to hear from you x
@cherade9 great :) please tell me it's an acoustic piano? If so... Email piano@imogenheap.com woop! Xx
Any more ideas for me to play my new song 'you know where to find me' 30.6.12 in Edinburgh? Just need a piano! piano@imogenheap.com xx
@UlyssesJonesUK I may well do! Please email piano @imogenheap.com to let me know details :) thanks. Will likely see you soon! Xx
On 30/6/12 i'll be singing #Heapsong7 on pianos in Edinburgh. Public/private spaces. Can be your home! Ideas? piano@imogenheap.com xx
Smoke everywhere (forgot about the chicken soup I was making) and chicken carcass burnt to a crisp! Fire alarm not working then :/
Goodnight xx
Tonight 23.32 BST there's an interview/piece about my time in China and #XiziSheknows xx http://t.co/vYYqIQ3Q @bbcworldservice
@AlfonsEd not for a while, sorry. Possibly July now but not certain. Might wait for the album x
..a mole hunt.' haha, made me laugh. Taken from an article in the Independent. I missed out on all the Jubileeations this weekend.
If there's one thing the Queen can't stand it's a blubber. On subsequent visits by her daughter-in-law the Queen would jovially suggest...
'the queen's relationship with Diana spencer got off to a bad start when the future princess cried after one of the corgis caught a mole...
Goodnight all. Loved my break in the Blue Mountains. Walking, reading, daydreaming. Feeling much better. Ready for 24 hour journey home tmw!
Den Fenella lookout point. Cloud covers a great valley hidden beyond the tree. Birdsong and waterfalls filled the void. http://t.co/dQrfkaD8
Really enjoying 'this is not the end of the book;'. Bought in Sydney's MCA gift shop after Christian Marclay's 'The Clock' (3.10-3.45pm) x

Hello! Here at #SongSummit with #TheListeningChair! Some really great song thoughts already :) http://t.co/z4uKIBw7 Exciting! xx
I recommend @dan__black's album Un. It's really f'Un good but not doing a good job of calming me to sleep! xx
@rglover702 wow! *blushes*
Ah thank you @rglover702. Very much enjoyed meeting you for our amuse bouche discussion! Really looking forward to more on Saturday. xx
@rahrahmaybe i'll let you know when I give it a go!
Anyone fancy hearing the 6 songs so far from the album played on piano to their relevant videos this Tuesday? http://t.co/PFHTrjYU
Phew! That took bleedin' ages! Making a 63 video playlist for RAGE TV in Australia. I forgot how good @Dan__Black is! Love your lyrics!
@rglover702 see you soon. Will be a bit fried from travel but looking forward to getting stuck in. Xx
Anyone got any questions for @rglover702 to throw at me on live radio session at 3.15pm tomorrow (Thursday) xx
Heading to Sydney! Xx flight about to take off. Looking forward to reuniting with #TheListeningChair :) and some sun perhaps? Xx
Here at #Googlezeitgeist with incredible minds all around. Was invited to sing a song in exchange for brain and heart food. Bargain!
Why I love @termacora #2407 = his piece for @livingarchitect's series 'from sustainable to evolvable' http://t.co/RJUKY6Wd @arupthoughts
@william_nish actually #heapsong9 will be scored to Bhutanese footage from october Himalayan trek last year! Xx
p.s. #TheListeningChair is a physical chair. You can listen to songs from my album so far but it also listens to ideas for final song xx
Ideally, need the tablet in London this week for integration before I + #TheListeningChair head for Sydney. x
You never know? Anyone got contacts with Acer? Looking at the Iconia A700 Android tablet for #TheListeningChair. Need quickly! x
@patternsplastic not anytime soon. When it feels right, we will do more am sure. Xx
p.s. A glorious day in Essex! I'm gonna do few hours studio time on #MeTheMachine then out for a jog. What's your plan for today? Xx
Tidying up (aka procrastination) before heading into studio found some scribblings re: @rjdj app for #Heapsong8  http://t.co/ow0h6NFO
This is PD - http://t.co/5yvht79V xx woop!
WOW! really exciting day we had with Rob + Joe from @RJDJ looking at generative musical instruments they've made in PD. So many ideas! x
Help for a film? @leviweaver who many people saw and loved as an opening artist on my 2006 tour is making a film. http://t.co/pAfXf9O1
My mate @shlomo is auditioning vocalists to join The Vocal Orchestra during Edinburgh Fest Fringe 2012. http://t.co/bezl8eaS :) Anyone? x
@tonyfransen that would be telling ;)
Almost finished but pause on releasing #MeTheMachine because no time before June to film video. I don't want to release it without one :/
@fsmvpggru @RachelFreire and Becky Stewart from @Codasign :)
@Truett he's also worked with @moritzwaldemeyer who made #Twitterdress and now #TheListeningChair with me :) x http://t.co/CatTgVVA
@casinclair ha! Good luck xx
@tarren_hartland tour ideas in a few people's heads/not ready for the outside yet. Album mid September. 5 songs already released :) xx
@rahrahmaybe cool tree is a heavy and expensive tree! It's In a box feeling rejected in storage right now :( nice plate! X
It'll be flexible and light (ish) and modified to stage size as it comes in pieces:) More soon hopefully xx
A quick scribble for sculpture on stage. Idea is for it to ebb and flow in white light to the level of my voice :) http://t.co/kdbncAMv
After wrestling for 2 days with plug in compatibility/searching for the right 'sound', I worked 'til 8am and decided it's better without!
Tired... Heading into town for full day of meetings about album deluxe fancy packaging/touring/ #TheListeningChair and #MeTheMachine pics.
@Niederquell doesn't solve how I'm gonna do it yet live but we are working on that solution! I don't want to not be able to do effect live.
@Niederquell combo of 4 Orange Vocoders and some various trickery. @kellysnook played in midi notes of my vocal line 4 me while I slept some
Thank you to all for ideas on Vocoder/Synth/audio/frequency to MIDI. I'm finally getting somewhere I think now with my machine voice :) xx
@MickeyRye perfect but it needs to be for Mac and it's only PC. Any Mac software you know of?
@IjhraelNoor does this output midi note data?
@kass_one yup, but needs to be for mac.
@TheInception is there a way to receive the output as midi notes? Can't see way to do that.
Hello! Anyone know of a plugin (mac/RTAS/VST/TDM) that will pitch track audio to midi in real time for live performance? e.g. Kantos
I'd hoped to match the wonder of #TheGloves with their 1st song. Thankfully #MeTheMachine is now shaping up to be a beauty, in my mind. :)
Now #TheGloves are out of my head and in the real world, there's lots of programming + practice to get to the next episode of the dream.
#TheGloves for writing, live + now in studio are taking me new places in creativity which is a real success! #MeTheMachine
Today I found an in with #MTM. My Earth Day performance was a bit of a let down + with all the team and excitement gone, I've had the blues!
The house is quiet apart from my basement :) back to late night tricks with a good stretch of studio time for #MeTheMachine - lovin' it!
Artwork for #MeTheMachine @3DiCD starting to take shape also. I will blog/tweet to see if anyone wants to submit pics for it. More soon x
Today meetings and interviews. Such exciting things for #TheGloves #TheListeningChair and now an app with @RJDJ for #Heapsong8 :) xx
@keithpp @loveeathfilm oh i seeee... ok. Will look into it. x thanks!
@keithpp I take it you weren't referring to @loveeathfilm but rather the Gloves portion of the event as LTE film is on Vimeo for free.
@keithpp FaNetwork and I put a load of cash into the event and we want to earn it back! Will see about not just Facebook though. Agreed!
Hoping to get #MeTheMachine recorded  ready for download for next Monday. Also thinking to release the LTE soundtrack too same time. xx
The @loveearthfilm crowd sourced nature film complete with my first orchestral soundtrack is up for free! http://t.co/s7DLd8nb Enjoy!
Fun times with #TheGloves team last night. Am slightly fuzzy around the edges! Chipping away at emails/ planning next moves #MeTheMachine
