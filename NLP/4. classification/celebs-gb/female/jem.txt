@TheWalkingDead @NicoleTubiola @SMVcrew @SarahKSilverman look what your shark did..! Have an amazing Season 5 guys :)
@TheWalkingDead @NicoleTubiola Ha, oh no! Shamed! &amp; my friends @SMVcrew do the music! I was saving for tour [&amp; wasn't sure if super gory...]
@TheRealGSmith Often actually, in my experience you have to make a move even when you don't know the best next step. It'll lead somewhere..
@NicoleTubiola Hey you! I've not even seen @TheWalkingDead yet so double weird! Interesting to be a conscious zombie for the experience ;)
Putting one foot forward every day towards your goal is the main difference between people who 'make it' and people who don't. Take the step
@SarahKSilverman Right?! I dreamt I was a zombie and was trying really hard not to go near live people (plus I really needed the bathroom)..
Is there a Founders app / alarm to remind you when to walk around, eat, drink water, sleep etc? Music &amp; tech are oddly similar..
@heinapurola do you mean the song? I'm thinking Mothers Day for that one but it's March in the UK &amp; May in US, what about where you are?
Might be the 1st to work "squash court" into a pretty song lyric..! It was tricky. For my Mum who's world champion, gotta give props! #Momma

If anyone knew the blood sweat &amp; tears, days months years that go into making an album they'd never be so thoughtless &amp; cruel as to leak it.
Me: Why does iMessage underline shit?!!! [So annoying] @toddburke : So you can add it to your calendar. #Oh.. #EducatingTheWelsh

Ok enough of that but worth knowing what's in these products! Next time eat ur placenta, u'll look like Heidi Klum & baby will be happy 2 ;)
Foreskin face cream anyone! http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/weblog/comments/1457/
The placenta, which supplies the fetus with oxygen & food during pregnancy :) RT @jos_90 eating what?
Is this it then, as an example? http://www.emkplacental.com/products/facial-cream.php
Allegedly...  Humans are all crazy!!!
Isn't that crazy though, if it's true.. It's made out 2 be gross/weird when it's v good 4 u & being rubbed into other peoples faces 4 $'s!!!
Apparently eating the placenta (you can get it in pill form now, not quite so bluhhghh!) is one of the best things for mother and child
The reason woman arn't allowed to keep their placenta's to eat is because the hospitals sell them to high end face cream companies..!!!!!
Here's a good story to investigate - @simonworrall and this might sound gross to some people but that's not the point, ready :

Have an amazing day then & here's to feeling as light as a feather :) x
My song 'Just a Ride' is dedicated to & inspired by Bill incase you didn't know :) Check him out, warning - not for the easily offended!
The mind's fiercely protective of its 'story' it has a lot invested.As Bill Hicks used 2 say "look at my furrows of worry, it must be real!"
The answer is often so simple, your mind (the control freak) will trash these kind of thoughts & negate them, making life more complicated..
'Get out of your own way & enjoy life' Friday ;) now that makes me feel happy & relaxed, you? Gonna take a walk & enjoy the free goods :)
STOP THE CHASE! Let yourself off the hook. Life isn't supposed to be this serious, let's stop planning our every move...
Get up, strive to 'do' something, to 'be' someone. We are all crazy, we are perfect perfect entities right now as we are...what a relief!
:) RT jos_90 you know, this song is simply lovely. When i hear it i can smile and walk with positive thoughts.

I LOVE FAURE! We sang a lot of John Rutter in our choir too, beautiful :) RT @Xyalon I can still sing Cantique de Jean Racine by heart.
Put up a new blog on my facebook about a wonderful cab driver who's showing the way :) http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jem/10140649953
I know right! @lestermendez and RACH also ripped off Muse! What about Chopin pilfering from Manilow! Who do these Europeans think they are?!
Me 2, when I was 21, juxtaposed choir & promoting drum&bass nights! RT @jos_90 you like classic music, right? :) i sang in a church choir :D
Might sound a bit lazy but for me it's one of my most creative places to write, that and walking by the sea, both great for contemplation :)
So happy ur enjoying the music, I love that song, I wrote the lyrics whilst sitting in bed in Detroit :) RT @mahmoudbusati #keep on walking
That's right! ;) RT @simonworrall I agree! Heather SHOULD adore me ! :)
http://twitpic.com/odyrt - I was given the Shrek Gingerbread Man head to try on after Justin Timberlake had body popped in it! @theellenshow

How random, I dreamt I was at Ellen DeGeneres' 4 Thanksgiving & she was making us do all the work while she took press pics with her lady..!

Every1 deserves 2 b adored by the 1 they love & visa versa :) It's the main criteria, people would be a lot happier if they didn't settle...

Now on to the 'Shine' soundtrack, could it get any better?! ;)

If there's anyone out there who's married or in a serious relationship who hasn't said "I LOVE YOU" for over a week...I'll say no more..!
Tell me if you do anything!!! What a good mood I'm in just from anticipating all the joy & possible surprises you might bring about today :)
It's often the little things, my Dentist got more out of the card than the flowers, the words...a little note perhaps, words are free :)
If you can't afford flowers, you cld wash/tidy up without being asked, or mow the lawn, or offer to do something sweet like a foot massage..
Esp when it's unexpected. Surprise someone today-buy/send flowers for no reason other than to make them smile & feel loved & cared about :)
Giving & doing nice, thoughtful, things makes you feel GREAT :) the reward of seeing someone beam with happiness is PRICELESS!
Just got the SWEETEST message from my dentist! I sent her flowers as a surprise as she's so amazing & deserves wonderful surprises like that
Pretty cool ;) Happy Wednesday y'all, smile smile smile smile smile, even if you don't feel like it force it and eventually you'll laugh :)
'This is Wayne Dyer, and I want to feel good! If your message is intended to do anything other than that, then you've got the wrong number."

Happy Monday y'all :) Hope you had a lovely weekend, here's to a fantastic week & for doing lots of nice things for other people & ourselves
Let's catch up in weekend :) @heatherdune

Last night was a 'mini GATE' incase u wondered what the connection was ;) GATE stands for Global Alliance for Transformational Entertainment
From GATE 1 - check this out, one of the highlights, brilliant! http://bit.ly/3S9U5y
I attended a GATE event this summer hosted by Jim Carrey & Eckhart Tolle & am hoping to get more involved as it is right up my street! :)
If u watch/listen to anything on his site, like I said, clear some time otherwise it will belittle the message & possibly make no sense! :)
I will say it's not the kind of thing you can dib in and out of whilst checking emails & twitter. If you get a chance to see him talk, GO!!!
This may not resonate with everyone, which is ok as everything comes to you when it's meant to, I just wanted to share my enthusiasm here :)
Jeff's site - http://www.lifewithoutacentre.com/index.html he blew my mind :)
I haven't checked out the audio/video on his site yet but I can't wait for last nights talk to be posted online,I'll let you know when it is
Ok so words cannot be used to explain the knowledge that was imparted last night at a talk at CAA no less, by Jeff Foster.
John, last night was AMAZING!!! Going to tweet about it now, thank you, thank you, thank you...still trying to process it all @visioneering1
Chlo! Nice to hear from you :) Send my love to your Mum and everyone and tell Chris to get on here! RT @chloemartinxx
Adios for today folks, have a great one, I've made a commitment to get off this thing by noon, the world awaits :)
It's very easy to think you need other people, they will help you but you need to start
...you can do it, and hopefully you will :) Beautiful & very self-empowering.
help you feel better etc, is the person who is looking, is YOU, you can help, you can help yourself do anything, you know the answers...
I feel it means, the person you're looking for, for whatever reason, to help you get somewhere, help you solve something,
Finally, in answer to this - RT @KarmicCycle Are we looking to find someone, or to be found ourselves?
Will do my best & as my parents used to say, as long as u've done ur best it's ok. BIG LOVE TO YOU ALL ON THIS SPLENDID DAY, DON'T WASTE IT!
HUGE thanks in advance for all your tweets, mentions & big ups! I'll defo be reading but fear if I try & respond to all I might collapse..!

Anyway, I got a bit sidetracked this summer but the music is all pretty much done now & I just need to get the vocals down

That's my mic and stand btw..!
Watching my bro's video for "wild place" on myspace, pretty nifty, who's that sexy girl in the bikini?
