Utter bullshit. My marriage is wonderful and also perfectly normal which involves the odd argument. The actual article I wrote in RED magazine does not include this ‘quote’  For my step children who are old enough to read magazines this is confusing. https://t.co/Do70UkZa3K

Yet these days I’m much better at speeding up the time wasted ruminating on it all. I’m glad that I can talk myself out of these mindsets and get back to knowing that I am ok.
I found myself in one of my usual cycles today. A diverse and interesting day of work left me feeling full of self doubt even though nothing went wrong. I couldn’t relax into contentment with my effort and instead fell in to picking holes in my performance

Essentially if you write something honest which depicts the light and shade we all experience in life, the bit people will subsequently write about is exclusively the dark bit. I’m looking at the light bit.
Not surprising how my articles in RED magazine get twisted online and in the press. @JesseWood are very happily married and more in love than ever. For my actual take on marriage just read the column that I wrote in the magazine itself ❤️

@sgfmann @richardosman True story!
One particular line in the documentary really stood out. Cary Grants thoughts on mental health.  ‘In life there is no end to getting well’. So often I think we subconsciously aim for an end result or far off utopia but really we have just keep learning.
I so loved watching this. What a life. https://t.co/PcEJwUsRhn

@richcw90 That’s so sad and unnecessary
@itschrissmith @dannywallace Heavenly
@mrjakehumphrey Its misguided frustration. I feel sorry for this guy last night that his view of the world is so narrow and his vision of the world revolves around him. And also Jakey... I always love you! You’re the best on that telly box!
@mrjakehumphrey So down for this! I do not get it! Rudeness is a waste of time.
I think we both found some solace in each other’s stories of rudeness from another. Also we did laugh as the customer who was rushing her produced about 30 vouchers she wanted marking off before leaving! Errr thought you were in a rush love?
Always so shocked when people are like this. Also at the supermarket today one of the cashiers was being treated badly by a customer and again I felt shocked. I ended up having a great chat with the cashier about this subject....

Oh maybe it’s not world book day but at Rex’s school it’s literacy week so it’s dress up day...or was supposed to be 😬
I would love to be able to post a cute photo of my son all dressed up for World Book Day but unfortunately Rex has kicked off and refuses to wear his costume I spent 3 hours sewing. Pre school dramas.
The kids and I have taken to listening exclusively to Justin Timberlake at bath time. Lots of off key singing and mum dancing 💃🏼
