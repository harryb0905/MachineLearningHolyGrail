Never thought I'd be writing about a Hysterosalpingography... but, it's where the story is going so it's where I'm going.
What surprises me about young athletes is how they equate any planning for life after sports to letting failure rent space in their head. False. The strong-minded athlete knows planning for life after their career ends it not the same as creating a plan to end their career.

If you want players to handle failure &amp; loss better through life, teach them that handling failure properly is processing complex emotions, NOT correlating complex emotions wt weakness. If some of my colleagues felt more comfortable being *weak*, they may still be alive today...
@BrianFosterLHU Don't minimize complex emotions associated wt anxiety, failure, and anger through reinforced value statements like, "be a man," "suck it up," "don't be a  p**sy," "keep it simple stupid," "no crying in baseball," etc. Life is complex. Sport is a life tool, not a blunt instrument.
@BrianFosterLHU I do. Many in fact. And the failure is not rooted in the point where the game ends and beyond, but in the life of the active player, which starts very young, goes through development, and well into adulthood.
You're a tree struck by lighting. The flash. The Intensity. The odds of it so close. Then it passes and the tallest branches die. You cut them off. Burn them up. And the only time someone talks about the lightning is when they ask "What made the tree grow so crooked?"
Leaving baseball was/is like coming off a drug. Cold. You think you're strong, that you can handle it. But then withdraw hits. And keeps hitting. And the days drag by. You try other drugs to get the fix back, to distract you, to help you "move on." But you don't. Not really...
@get_stoke_d Isn't that pretty much what Trump does now, just in Twitter form?

Thank you, all, for your kind words on my writing. It's inspiring, and it's helped me realize why I should keep doing it. I will. 2019 will be my return to the medium. I'll share stories and articles here... and maybe bigger in 2020. Thanks again.
I don't know why I ever stopped writing. I guess I believed, in error, that I wasn't really, truly very good at it without being backstopped by baseball or famous friends. Now, as I look back, I see how much joy it brought me, and in pursuing that joy, satisfaction.
@RealMattGingras No... opportunity wasted on her part.
So, about that hiring manager that emailed me to call me names about not taking the job. I apologized to her about any confusion I may have caused. Complimented her company. Wished her luck on the search. Offered to connect her to other applicants I knew.   No response...
Nailed it. https://t.co/qg6shUwsV3

He really did love the Garfoose concept. And knowing that I, as a rookie who couldn't make the roster out of camp, had done something to make Roy Halladay, the paragon of focus and intensity, crack a smile and laugh...ü•∫ I'll cherish that memory forerver.
I presented the sculpt to another vet who took it into Roy‚Äîin the training room working out‚Äî and said, "Doc, did you see this F'n thing?" Roy looked it over and said, "How did we not know about this before?!" Most I'd ever heard him talk at the time‚Äîand it made me "The Garfoose."
In Spring Training in 2009, he and some other vets heard about the Garfoose thing I drew with my autograph as a gag. They made it my nickname. They asked me to draw it, for a chuckle. Instead, I leaned into it and bought clay, sculpted, and baked this: https://t.co/ovzA3ApxoZ
Roy signed it for me when I was with the team in 2009. As a rookie, I was terrified to ask him but he was always very kind. He signed that jersey for me to keep, and 12 baseballs that my wife @GroovyGarfoose auctioned for a special needs music summer camp so no kids had to pay.
My wife had this framed for me for Christmas.   I cried. https://t.co/oN83AWGHvy

@GhostRunnrOn3rd That's just it: rowing uses your legs, back, core, and lightly uses the shoulders (if you form is correct) similar to most of the post-start back/shoulder excercises pitchers are required to do anyway. Plus it builds strength, and is lower impact on joints. The ++ seems obvious?
I could see a strong rowing program, on a machine like @concept2 makes, doing wonders for staminia, recovery, strength, and overall injury pervention for pitchers. So many "break" muscles involved, and the work similarities to throwing seems uncanny.
I started rowing instead of running recently. Never rowed before. Now, as I look back, I wonder why rowing isn't the mandatory cardio requirement of all pitchers the day after their starts? It strikes me as much more valuable with respect to the sport/position.
@nkalamb Sure. Hit me up.

I don't think that's the same Cpt. A, from the same timeline. I think there will be another reality/dimension play before it's all done. I also think Thanos will suffer some self-inflicted defeat/crisis from being fused to the stones. The only person that beats Thanos is Thanos.

@literateartist Heartbroken. Devastated. He needed me.
I mean, I worshipped Trevor Hoffman, dreamed of meeting him, but there was no scenario in my mind wherein our first conversation was him sitting down next to me and saying, "Your mom wrote me. She said you're really horny and fighting a battle with keeping it in your pants..."
She said he's a big fan. Okay. But if I write this young man, it would just be so he could, in turn, contact his Mom and have that awkward "MOM! üò≥ü§¨üò°ü§Ø I can't believe you told him that!" moment. How else could that go?!?

If you've been writing to me at TheGarfoose@gmail.com; sorry, I've not checked the account in years. I used to have those emails forwarded to other accounts...  I thought people just stopped writing to me, honestly. Turns out I was really wrong.
@kenkliu Wow. Thanks, Ken. I hope your book is a smashing success!
@RobsonLinda Hey Linda! How are you?! Sure, please do. We're all part of the Kent family now, right :-). I miss your classes, they were great!
Okay, so, let's just say that, hypothetically speaking, @Scott48Richmond and I could have our own radio/live-stream show covering (mostly) baseball... Would anyone want to listen to that?
Don't mistake making noise for making a difference.
@TripleH I remember breaking this news once before... Thanks for not killing me. And thanks for taking the time to chat with me about life in wrestling. Honestly one of the most fascinating conversations I've ever had. Godspeed on your recovery!
Hmmm... I don't think Trump played the same video games I did, because, as I recall, the fortified troops with guns were very different than roaming tribes with rocks.
@weberwildcat71 @VincentAbnett Thank you! That's very kind of you.
I really love "Dan" @VincentAbnett's writting. Was trying to give him some well earned praise and I accidently praised every person named "Dan" in al of Twitter.   Meh, I stand by it.   Great job, all Dans everywhere, we couldn't have done it without you.
@VincentAbnett,   Thanks for all your incrdible writting. You've created some of my favorite worlds (and galaxies, and universes, and realities..). I'm in awe of (and thankful for) your ability to craft engaging work over and over and over again.   Cheers!

I guess I just miss playing it.   And then, when it was over, not thinking about what it meant beyond how much running and icing I had coming before I got to play it again.
@frang4u I think we have different definitions of "trashing."
@VegasVooDoo99 Hey, Mark. I love playing the game‚Äîbut I don't like the industry of it, ya dig? I miss when it was just playing a fun game... feels like forever ago.
@milksy25 I think it would, actually.
The Game is still great. But, for me, it's gas around it that makes it flavorless. An album on repeat. New age vs Old school. Skill vs Luck. Franchise vs Flop. An avalanche of numbers. And, the worst sin of them all, "is he playing the game the right way?"   Dunno. Is there one?
Why take time away for the game? It gets predictable. Every pre-season: a wave of hype crashing against the shoals of underwhelmance. Panic over of a star's slow start. The incessant chirping of the "it's early" birds. Projections. Prophecy. Narratives born of randomness...
@Mattyb74_ I really like the way he carries himself. Real leader out there. A Bulldog. Doesn't matter who he's facing. You think he's thinking about stats, not at all. He's doing it for the love of the game....
@perryareid False. You won a game!
Tonight is the first time I've looked at the MLB standings in 6 months...  .... Sweet Jesus, Baltimore. What happened?
I didn't watch a single baseball game this season. Not one.   No news. No apps. No fantasy... Nothing.   So, basically, if someone put me on the radio right now to talk about baseball, I'd sound just as informed as I did all the years I got paid to do it.
When you're chewing on life's gristle,  don't grumble‚Äîgive a whistle!  And this'll  help things turn out for the behhhhh-st.   Oooooooo.... {you sing}

Real personal change is difficult. Painful. Like culling old growth to make way for new, or splitting hard earth for fresh cultivation. It should not be promised lightly, and is never delivered in the same conversation by which its need is recognized.
The most important thing you'll ever learn to manage in business is your ego.
Minor league players are not interns. They are not seasonal workers. They do everything a big leaguer does, aside from enjoy the union power and league status. Denying them minimum wage via pork bill stuffing is insulting and a gross use of legislative power.

I simply cannot express to you, in any medium, how much I respected Roy Halladay. I'm still reeling from his loss. He was a hero to me, even if I never got to tell him that directly; he was a hero and an inspiration, and I'm so incredible sad he's gone...
Beyond gifted, but never spoke of it. Inspired with action, not words.  Never compromised, backed down, or judged.  Always respectful.  Ever-kind.  Genuinely humble.  Quiet. Honest. Sincere. Caring.  A Timeless example.  I knew greatness. I knew Roy Halladay.
...Just as my generation asked when it learnd of all that which history has proven foolish &amp; myopic, yet stubbornly held as fundamental.

The hard part of dealing with personal issues in public venues‚ÄîYou get, "I don't come here to hear you whine, I come for entertainment."
You know, when I wrote Bigger Than the Game (anxiety/depression in bb) biggest critique was "not what I want to hear about from athletes."
Stigmatizing mental issues in pro-sports has lessened. It used to brand you a "head case," damaged goods. The unfixable injury...
That "Lost" feeling. That moment when your emotions don't work like the used to. Who am I? What's wrong with me? I don't belong here...
Osuna has went through something a lot of us (I wrote a book about it) have went through in baseball. Don't mistake his openness as weakness
@broshuis @jonahkeri @glenesimard @euqubud Yeah, thanks, I mean, I didn't write a book about it or anything... ;-)
Having an issue you don't understand is hard enough. Having one no one else understands or actively trivializes, is hell.
If you deal with it in a "tough" "no-whining" "no mental weakness" environment, it can feel like a defect, failing, or, at worst, prison.
If you don't deal with anxiety and depression, It will sound like an irrational/illogical sense of panic, sadness or discomfort.

@neilbearse Thanks, Neil. I will! Always nice to have friends. We're having issues getting the Forms to track as events - Using gravity forms, FYI.
And, for you managers out there, I told them I'd pay for all the learning, when needed, do it on my own time, and not pull them off task.
I committed for 3 months. So, I learn. They get me cheap. I work hard. And if it blossoms, great. If not, no damage and I keep the knowledge
I'd encourage other job seekers to (if you can) offer their time for cheap/free. No substitute for real experience, no matter how it comes.
You know, I'm happy. Probably the most happy I've been since before I retired. Feels good to take on new challenges and test myself.
Anyway, this is a really cool opportunity for me. I have no ego about the position. I just want to learn new and valuable skills.
My goal is to develop a working, real world set of useful skills, and then reassess. I'll still be on TSN and covering the Jays.
Lawyers apparently won't let you work for free. Didn't see that coming. So, I'm a paid intern, and I get to work on some cool stuff.
Actually, it was my idea. I actually proposed to work for free in exchange for a chance to learn the business + top stack web dev.
I know you're all interested to hear that I took an entry level position making $10 an hour at a marketing company. #Jealous
Trying learn Google Tag Manager. Feels like if should be easier than it is.
@larryfleisher @brodskyme If not, It makes excellent toilet paper.
@larryfleisher @brodskyme Cant decide if that's an insult or a compliment.
@bluebirdbanter Who said I was going to?
Sadly, it's more compelling watching Apple's home automation device advertising than watching a Bay directed Transformers film.
@c_perry I stopped going after #2. But bc I grew up loving the toys, I feel obligated to watch them as rentals at some point.
The scripts are so bad. I mean, even for cartoon source material, they're bad. B movie, farcical, blunt force brain trauma, bad.
Walked out of the theater on Transformers #2. Fell asleep during #4. I fully expect #5 to epic suck. My inner 80's child hates Micheal Bay.
I saw @CarlinsCorner today. It was magical. https://t.co/ZntesMfpEU
@rappsy14 Saying a job track is unfair and very difficult for little reward is not discouragement. It's honesty. And we're an adaptable species.
People say, "I have a passion for this!" Great. And you'll have many such passions in your life. Some of them may actually support you.
@NotYourProfAnge My ears a burning.
@dan_labbe I cry especially hard over you. But that's for other reasons...   Beat any good fish lately?
Diversify. Chase but know you can make a good living elsewhere. Don't short suit yourself.   ‚Äî&gt; Same advice I give to wannabe Pro athletes.
Except that the ability to write about sports is a lower barrier of entry skill. I would say to those people who want to be sports writers:
The earnings cap is low to start and few of the many ever become relevant enough to pull down top $. Its not unlike the sports they cover.
It's a consistently exploited job. The employer knows you love sports; that a way more than needed # people want to work in sports...
When people tell me they want to be sports reporters/writers/commentators, I weep for them.
@astrit125 For a guy who did nothing with his, you sure do too.
@TylerKepner Yeah, and he was the last boss of several Mortal Kombat games.
Told her I grew up in Heartland = can't hunt. Also, if Heartland supplies all goods, that ruins her "everything comes from China" rant.
She says big city folks don't realize the Heartland makes all their food and supplies all their goods. She tells me they're out of touch...
Talked to my mom today. She tells me that people on coasts/in big cities have no practical, midlander skills, like hunting and fishing.
"This was supposed to be a vigil, but now it's a protest... what's happening here?" Uh, I dunno, how about not letting ppl die for nothing.
Cable news = crap, on that we agree, but acting shocked at ppl remembering vics of gun related tragedy by speaking out o/guns... Really Fox?
Josh Donaldson's ears on soooo burning. https://t.co/lDjwwd4YhB
@msbviper You're right. We should give drugs to everyone, too. Make it balanced.
So, if GOOD ppl can't get guns bc guns went away, BAD people would STILL get guns, bc = they bad. So guns must remain to balance the Force?ü§î
So, if GOOD ppl have guns they stop BAD ppl's guns, bc, u know, BAD ppl will get guns anyway, bc = they bad. So GOOD ppl wt guns will cya ü§î
@craigcalcaterra Yeah, the old "I've got stuff" routine. False friends all over again, Slappy. False friends...
@jessespector Yeah, but, bc good persons also had a guns they were able to draxx them terry's sklounz before their bad guns could do more damage, right?
@craigcalcaterra want to meet up at Origins?
About to leave San Fran. It's amazing. Just amazing. Why do I not live in it?
Gotta say, if you're registered sex offender, in a biz built from a kid's game, what your clubhouse thinks is the least of your problems.
As an analyst, I never expected to be asked "what does it mean to have a registered sex offender in your clubhouse?"
Prices at this San Francisco airport bar are so high they need a mortgage department. Scotch comes in 12yr, 18yr, and 30yr fixed.
@ihavearashmadan I think future clubhouses are the least of his concern.

Sitting in the airport. Flight delayed. Should have booked through Aviato. Air traffic control totally caked its pants.
Anyone going to their local stadium for a Comey testimony watch party? Apparently some bars are open early for that very thing...
@jessespector You know what irks me about that is, I know male sideline reporters who've been fired in order to get a female on field for camera time...
@jessespector If this happened the other way round, could you imagine the blow back?
@jessespector Uncool.
@FlyerRapJayPat .It's not an issue unless you make it one. Learning to communicate does not mean one side learns the other's language or [consequences]...
An unexamined truth is not truth. And when we stop examining truth because the result may make us uncomfortable, we're already living a lie.
FTR, neither baseball great referenced had any inkling/intention to be racist. They wanted to speak "baseball truth." Which is my point...
Sadly, This "play/speak our way = right way," blended wt blue color values makes racism feel more nostalgic instead of suffocating.
If you want a league with the best possible talent, you have to make it accessible for all people. This is not unique to baseball.
And, "Spanish speakers can't team cores because language barriers," oddly sounds like, "there is only one accepted team language. Mine."
"No translators. Speak baseball language!" said by one who talks baseball in English sounds a lot like, "Learn English or don't play here."

All of these movies give me the feeling that Vin Diesel will be cast as Darkseid and Michael Bay will direct.

When asked what was going through is head during the brawl, Buster Posey's response: https://t.co/mrjMmQUlaw
Luv listening to the Nats fans say "Posey let Strick get attacked bc he deserved it!" Right after they say "throwing at batters is assault!"
The theory of "let him charge so we can fight," is such an San Francisco thing. Basically what the did when Godzilla last attacked.
It's like that episode of the Office where Michael falls into the fountain pool and Jim is just standing there, letting it happen...
I'm still trying to figure out what Buster Posey was doing, standing there until the first punch was thrown...

I'd just like to point out that, in my first MLB at bat, I made it to third base. So I can talk trash about making it to third, mmmkay.
@PJManning Hey, I made it to third base on my first big league AB!
Does this mean the Jays now fire-sale trade Kevin Pillar, ala Yunel Escobar? E tu, tu ere, Kevin Pillar?
Tonight, Luke Maile will text his parents about making it to third base...
Oh, someone's playing a prank here... they let him on base... there had better be a pie and hidden camera coming..
Does Luke Maile even need to come up to the plate or can he just shout "you got me!" from the dugout, and chill?
The minute I go and write an article about how good I think they are... they give up 6 runs in the first inning.   Hire me, Braves.
@philfparkinson Yeah, but they have Davus Prismon.
Jays made major trades at the deadline in 15, and had prospects to do it. Jbau and Marin hot, EE still a Jay. Then Price, JD, Tulo, et al...
I've read all these takes on how the Blue Jays had the same record in 15 that they have now, but they weren't the same clubs. Not even close
@JonathanEHoover It's OOP

Deltron 3030 and I are currently discussing the future of the Blue Jays...
Damn heptipods, spraying their space graffiti all over my windows.
Thing is, I like @coolmini_or_not's games, and their art, and their minis... but damn... now you tell me "sometime in Q2." Uuug.
I KickStarter-ed an expansion to Arcadia Quest nearly 2 years ago now and still have not gotten it. @coolmini_or_not This vexes me.
I do a really good imitation of Dave Chapelle's imitation of a white guy.   So i got that going for me, which is nice.
@CSEGames @moltenink @darylmandrews @JayAhre Wait, I thought wizards all agree that "you shall not pass?"
May the 4th be with you!  Except you....   You know who you are.
@hankschulman Yeah, but that coffee is like 7 dollars and that's not include the whipped cream.
Thank you for Tweeting. All of our representatives are busy right now, but your issue is very important to us...   I'm dead inside.

@TSNResearch You can't even remember what you had for dinner yesterday, Kevin.
@TheTimZiegler He got thrown at BC f those homers. Your wrong Tim, here Tim. There is strong social precedent.
@TheTimZiegler Oh? Ask the Rangers fanbase if Bautista deserved anything he got after that 2015 playoffs.
Yes, clearly I'm advocating for evil to persist in our world because it always has. That's exactly the metaphor I was going for here.
They hit my favorite player! That's assault! Someone should do something!  Oh, look, they hit that guy I don't like. Heh.. he deserved it.
We decry assault when what we've been too lazy to change happens again. Might as well say thoughts and prayers, Manny, thoughts and prayers.
@HumandChuck Say it or unfollow.
All for progress here, and Machado has EVERY RIGHT to be upset, but there are ways to get where you want to be without the gushing F-bombs.
If you want it changed, speak up to the union and the commissioners office. Hard slides are changed, game clock changed, hazing changed...
OMG, this happens every year. Good player gets thrown at an we scream assault, villainy, no justice! Only been happening SINCE ALWAYS.
@mbalducciUF @JCarr110 But the other examples? They work for you?
@JCarr110 It's assault now? Now that it happens to Machado? Now that he had his rant? Checks in Hockey? Sacking the QB. Sliding in hard?
@ursus_arctos59 Cry me a river, bear. (get it!). Seriously, he's mad. I get it. But this is a public game. Composure helps more than it hurts.
@davieskyle Different rhetoric, sure, but that level of angry ranting stupid doesn't get results anywhere.
I'm sorry, I don't care if you get thrown at. If you're mad, don't go on a expletive rant to the media. Hurts you more than it helps you.
Just goes to show that the game has changed, we've changed, and that thoughtful communication still, and will always, have incredible power.
Trying to think when any player has ever said anything critical of the Boston fanbase and made it out a live, let alone ovated.
10 years later, Adam Jones can justly criticize the behaviors of fans with measured, thoughtful words, and be heard, and feel strong...
If they said something, they'd just get it worst. Speaking up would let folks know it bothered them, and it was better for all to keep quiet
I remember when I played, and my black teammates would say they were getting slurred, and it was BS, but they had to keep quiet bc...
@iamphiltee Woooot! Hope you like this one. It's my darkest season yet, Morty. I finally get that Mulan dipping sauce.

@BarryDavis_ They're already there.
@Tjrohr Think harder
I can't imagine the amount of head swimming this Jays team is doing now. They must be exhausted from self examination and self loathing.
Managers try to put players in situations to achieve. After that, the rest is out of their control, and all results are the players' to own.
When players get paid an avg. of 20X what a manager--who didn't draft/sign them-- makes, you can't blame him as soul reason for failure.
@black_bile But they just talk about players. I got them to call the station and yell back‚Äîwhich is exciting!!
It's fun watching the Jays find new and creative ways to lose games...And by "fun" I mean O MY FREAKING GAWD WHY YOU NO WIN NO MORE?!?!
Anyone else have to punch their microwave to make it work?
So...today I learned how to jackhammer out a basement floor and re-run a drainage line.   I can't wait to update my Wikipedia page.
It's not glamorous, or quick, or anything HGTV. it's a slog, with days lost from depression at the sheer volume of work I've yet to do.
...Sunk a lot of man hours and dollars into it. Had waterproofers come do my basement. 3 hours in they shatter my drain stack. üò£üò±
Re-plumbed it, new electrical, new HVAC runs, new windows, new open kitchen, lights, added a bath, paint, landscaping...
I've been flipping a property for the last 3 months now. Doing it all myself, with some help here and there... century home... lot of work.

If Jeb Bush and Jeter announced themselves as a presidential ticket, at this point I wouldn't bat an eye. Buying the Marlins seems tame.
Favorite part of Stroman's hit: when he says, "I'm always in the cage..." Fun! Right up til u get hurt doing stuff they don't pay u to do.
I remember practicing the normal slide in spring training. I do not remember practicing the catcher-leap into Ninja-roll.   I was cheated.

@jakelarsen Yes, sorry. I get my Universes confused.
@jakelarsen Yeah. No depth. Frustrates me as well. Interested to see what this "child reincarnation of Majn But" turns into, though.
@jakelarsen @JoshuaHowsam No. Never watched that one. Big fan of One Punch Man, though.
@jakelarsen I hope he gets to visit his homeward in universe 8. I also hope he and female Broli get a to fight it out in ToP.
@jakelarsen @JoshuaHowsam When he fights in the tournament of power, he'd better go the distance and not get cheap-shotted off. I'll be disappointed.

I said: "Excuse me? Did you have more?"  Gym cop: "it's just rude and *mumble mumble...."  "Got it." I said.  That was it.

Linkedin tells me my profile has had a 169% increase in views by mystery people I don't know and may never... Life changing stuff.
I thought a guy with a Celtic cross, a crucifix, an infinity symbol, and strings of Chinese &amp; Hebrew word tats would be more understanding.
It's silly, I know, but I used to work out as part of an occupation. Now I'm getting policed by a tatted-up Bro-ham in a "shame-free" gym.
He says, "bro, you don't gotta hit the floor with your weights. It's not cool for everyone else here. It's disrespectful and sh*t."
I'm reluctant to say I go to Planet Fitness, where enjoying or pushing yourself too hard is punishable by public shaming... but I do.
I did not drop them, or grunt, or throw them. I don't wear a weightlifter's T (more skin than shirt)... but I do sometimes bump the floor.
There is always one guy at a gym who acts like the gym police. Today he yelled at me for letting my weight hit the floor while doing twists.
@EGVroom When do I get to come up and spend two weeks with you at our own private coding bootcamp?

@EGVroom Shane, lets be honest, I suck so badly people don't even ask me to sign my own baseball card for fear for devaluing the cardboard.
Feeling a little off today. Only have five hundred people telling me I suck instead of my usual thousand. Gotta step up my game.
@AMScarr People ask me not to sign mine because my name devalues the product.

@thejdcampbell Level difference is clear. No debate there. But 3 Big League studs should be able to out hit a rookie PR stunt, even if that rook's in Low A
@thejdcampbell You misunderstand. Tebow = supposed to be bad, and is, bc no Xp in baseball AT ALL. But as bad as he is, his production is better than 3 J's
@thejdcampbell OMG I HAD NO IDEA!
Why would I be ashamed or feel stupid for highlighting an oddball stat the clearly shows Tebow is the next Mike Trout? Calm down, people.
@ronawsumb Baseball is a part of culture. Culture is the *great* here. The game is a tool for cultural value transmission. That's my point.
Clearly I believe the low level minors are the same as the Bigs and want Tebow to replace Bautista ASAP. I won't rest until this happens!
@JMcGuireMLB You misunderstand. A PR stunt with no Pro/exp is doing better at his level after not playing for 10 yrs than the MLB vets are theirs.
@Giants55 @ScottyMacThinks And if Tebow had played all his life, without a 10+ year break from the game, he might too.
@Kara_Wagland Both look over matched, but the PR stunt that has never played pro ball is doing better than the MLB vets, despite exp/level differences.
@ronawsumb The *great game* does not get embarrassed. Also, it's not that great, and It's just a game, and by game I mostly mean business.
@yyzsportsmedia Trade all of them for Mulan Szechwan McNugget Sauce.
@yyzsportsmedia Bring back Ice Tea Gatorade.
Both look over matched, but the publicity stunt who has played zero years at his level is doing better than the veterans playing at theirs.
You have some of baseball's best hitters struggling so badly at the majors they look like the best effort of Tebow in the minors.
FWIW, the "YOU IDIOT! TEBOW IS IN THE LOW MINORS!" response was expected. But the comparison highlights the two group's unique struggles.
Tebow is, indeed, in the minors.... and hasn't played baseball since high school, and is facing the top developing talent on the planet.
@kmthomp29 And hasn't played baseball in over a decade, and his highest experience level before this was High School... so...
You might say "but one is in the low minors. The others are in the Bigs." My response, "one never played baseball beyond high school."
Tim Tebow has a better batting average than 3 regular Blue Jays, more RBIs than the 3 combine, And more HR's than Bautista @ScottyMacThinks
@MichaelBryenton @SportsCentre @BlueJays @A_Sanch41 I've had that several times in my career. I had to pitch through it, and it bleed on the baseball. Luckily, I rarely ever pitched!
@ScottyMacThinks You'll never lose me, Scotty.  ...Unless you cross me. Then you'll lose everything. EVERYTHING!
@GiantsNirvana Awesome! Thanks for letting me know. Favorite part?
Totally unrelated, but, I really hope Celine Dion learns that the word LOVE does not include a U or an R. DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR LUURRRVE!
Later, in a interview with reporters, Martin had this to say: "When you question me, for a simple answer, I don't know what to say. No..."
&lt;Cont&gt;" ...Don't give up on your faith. Wins come to those who believe it. And that's the way it is."
Martin: "Guys, When you want it the most, there's no easy way out. When you're ready to go, and your heart's left in doubt..."
Nice win today by the Jays. I have it good authority that, before the game, Russell Martin gave the team a pep talk about their situation...
Pedro's analysis of "panic a bit" seems, well... How does one panic *a bit*? It's an all or nothing act. Concern? Sure. Panic? Not yet.
Bruce also doesn't fix Martin, Bautista, and Travis sharing rights to 2 RBI's. Only answer for now is to wait and see if they turn it on.
Jay Bruce doesn't fix the 4 regulars hitting .212 or less on the Jays lineup. He's not the droid you're looking for.

Thank you everyone, for your kind and encouraging words today. I have kind followers.
@craigruderman My dad... that's what he deals with.
@lzqjjn No idea
1-8 and a potentially hurt rain bringer is not a great start. Higher chance of seeing a unicorn than a timely Jays hit right now.
While I know many would say that's okay, it doesn't *feel* okay. It doesn't mean I, or those like me, will let ourselves feel better...
Like all public facing people, I have a general fear of looking weak or confused. But I am, a lot more than I'd like to admit. And...
I fear expressing this stuff on Twitter. I'm a public(ish) figure. I'm job hunting. I need to look safe/strong. But I have my struggles...
Some people say my relentless self abuse made me a competitor/successful. Now I find that it just makes me unrealistic and tortured.
Seems that the worst things in life are the ones you have to beg yourself to stop doing, even when you don't know why you started.
Today I had a panic attack so intense that I curled up on the floor and beat my head into it, begging myself to stop...

@BeachByWall The people buying properties and the trusts that invest in them are probably aware of the internet's impact on B&amp;M commercial stores.
@BeachByWall Not all REITs are composed of commercial. Many are health/hopsital or residential,  or a combination.
@BeachByWall They're a great investment vehicle in a diversified portfolio. Not brave, just smart.

Okay, okay. Sell your TO house and buy a submarine. Then live in the underground secret city in Lake Ontario. Excellent schools, low crime.

Now I can't flee Trump's Hunger Games because I can't afford a house in TO... Thanks a lot, you guys.
Interestingly, the recent jump in TO house prices/availability correlates well with the US election and the VISA/Immigration issues ü§î
Just ask yourself: would your house sell *you* for 1.6 million dollars?
@linguinidimare Make sure the rent deal pays you top dollar, guaraunteed, through the crash. Now all you have to do is perfectly predict the crash üò¨
@cgarber8 @ronawsumb Well, if a 1.3 million dollar house is now with 1.6, you'd have enough there to cover it if your annual Div was near 4-7%.
@IanConway @LongLiveBrad Done.
@LongLiveBrad @IanConway Brad, there is no Alpha city status. Land locked cities face a bigger issues. 33% price ST deviation is alarming. We're done here.
@linguinidimare Don't buy it when the market crashes as your asset will have crashed too.
@LongLiveBrad @IanConway The massive jump in prices in the last 6 months screams correction. I'd sell high, cash in, buy a rental for myself and a rental to let out.
@LongLiveBrad @IanConway It's a bell weather. The lack of new housing and in affordability of housing for new workforce entrants is dangerous for econ growth.
@linguinidimare I like that strategy too.
@maguire1166 Oh, yeah, right, pay a dollar so you can deduct 12 cents.
@LongLiveBrad @IanConway Manhatten is an Island. Toronto is not. It's a city with bad infrastructure inflating houses costs.
@The_Road_Guy But does your home like you?
High interest funds: VYM, HYHG, any selection of REITs, Ford, Coke, Pepsi, GE, JnJ, BP, Energy stocks, Utility stocks...
@Scottshaw21 @ronawsumb ETF's? You can easily pull down 4% of better on Divs alone, depending on your asset mix.
@ronawsumb Buy Coke. Buy Ford. Buy GE. Buy JNJ. Buy VYM. Buy NLY. Buy and REIT fun... BUY THEM ALL.
@kevinbull666 Rent.
@IanConway Rent.
Sell your single detached home and take the windfall of profit, put it in a high interest fund, and let that interest pay rent for you.
If I owned a home in Toronto, I would sell it now. The housing prices are ridiculous. Bubble ridiculous.
@andrewsheehy228 @RGriffinStar @ScottyMacThinks Stop.
"Told him he needs to hide the ball better. I suggested taking a shrub out to the mound and pitching out of it. A conifer, if possible."
I'll let you decide who made those quotes in my alternative reality post game interviews.
"When me hit ball, me hit ball good. Me know it. Ball go out. Me know it....You done or need more words? Me hungry."
"The gloves were fresh, with the that new glove boquet. I was so into the smell that I forgot pine tar, even after I flung the first bat."
"'Soon as I let it go and knew the throw was online, I was like, 'oh, hell yea, I'm gonna score tonight.' And I mean in the Biblical sense."
"Well, Trumbo's a large man. Huge and stuff. Like a barge. Ball got scared and just flew away, right out over the fence."
There's no way to know what the tiger is thinking, we don't have the technology.

Kevin Pillar is awesome.
Gausman was successful today because he threw the ball sideways off a rain soaked precipice... Also, good breaking ball.
*sorry RE: SP* You can't say one specific pitcher is good because, "He throws down hill." Like all pitchers aren't standing on a hill...
"This guy's a good pitcher bc he throws the ball out of a 4 foot pit he digs before the start of each inning... umpires curiously silent."
@SQUEEZEMEEZ Yes. Yes he does. Thank you for noticing; actually brought up the "overwhelming amount of words per comment" thing to their producer once.

Healthy Mets would be amazing to watch all year. Sadly, 'bout as likely as dolphins pirating submarines and using guns to enslave humans.
Could the Indians win 100? Yes. I'd be disappointed if they didn't threaten it. They're my favorite AL team over all.
Most Curious Jay: Martin. Contract + age. Bat may be Mendoza-esque this season, but who cares if he keeps Liri looking like he has in ST.
My most interesting ALE team: Yankees. Lot of really interesting position prospects playing in a small park with media saturated fanbase.
Paper Prophecies for 2017: Jays 2nd in the ALE. Really, It's Boston's division to lose. Sox, Jays, Yanks, Baltimore, Rays, resp.
@JoshuaHowsam Okay then *clears throat* : The Jays have players in their organization talented enough to make it to the Bigs this year.   Pay me.
@JoshuaHowsam This is why, if I had it all to do over again, I'd become a "futures and prospects" analyst‚Äîbecause you can say basically whatever you want.
@PaddockMark Yeah, you know, like pills and stuff...
@michael_schlact Wait, what? That's how I got to the Big Leagues! That's how *every* minor leaguer gets to the Big Leagues!
I can see the Jays pulling off 85+ wins again this season, with pitching &amp; speed bridging pure power production gaps. But does that = PO's?
Folks say Segura is the next A-Rod (defensively). High praise, but also a hell of model to live up to‚ÄîHe'd have to start juicing *now*.
As for the J's‚Äîlove the fab five, but it's a long gap from 5 to 6. Also, that end of June through July stretch is not the time to get hurt.
Asked about the M's PO chances today. Gosh, just so much riding on Cano, Cruz, and Seager. Where does the rest of the production come from?

@RayeJenny Isn't that the platform his father-in-law was elected on?
I like the Jays rotation better than soooo many of the "better" Fangraphs suggested power rankings. Are they banking on regression/injury?
Jared Kushner will fix 0% of the things.
@MikeCormack I appreciate you calling me prominent.
Which, I guess, makes Jose Bautista Walter?
JP was probably one of the most easy going, positive vibes guy I've known in baseball. Was like playing on the same team as The Dude.
JP Howell is one of my favorite former teammates. No one made you feel like you have something to be proud of/feel confident in, like JP.

When any baseball player spends their off season bending rebar, hanging sheetrock, and putting overtime in at the mill, we'll talk, Dan.
I hate when sports talk mutates into projections of reliability. "That guy making in a single night what I earn in a lifetime 'gets it.'"
Duquette: Bautista not "blue collar." Not relatable. ü§î Because Davis, making 21 mill to hit balls real far is quintessential blue color Joe?
Even so, Gibbons has earned it, in so far as managers can earn anything: Handled media + team egos + youth + new front office well, and won.
Managers have virtually no control over what players do once put on the field. They win - extension deals. They lose - FIRE HIM NOW!

In fact, one could argue that a player controlling what he can control and not worrying about what he can't is the best thing he can do.
Established players are getting work in, new players are showing goods, edge players are competing... W/L are a byproduct, not a focus.
I wouldn't worry (in case you were) about the Jays ST W/L's. We discuss this every year: ST about evaluating talent, not W accumulation.

An injury in ST that prevents steady AB's from live MLB pitchers can set a hitter's optimal production quotient back at season start.
A pitcher can throw to 1/2 hitters, pitch low leverage innings from the pen, but a hitter has to get steady Big League AB's to calibrate.
He's at the greatest disadvantage as his opportunity to get his timing for live pitching in meaningless practice games is the weakest link.
Remember that today's MLB player comes into camp in shape. They don't go there to get in shape. That said, when a hitter has a ST injury...
@trevwolff Thanks! Glad you like it.
@bwill_13 You're right, it's actually a steal. I was amazing for like 5 minutes.

@JustBaseball25 False: Work atmosphere studies are numerous and conclusive: Getting a long with coworkers is key to productivity.
Latos: I fear Jays would pay for results that have changed dramatically from years ago, and a personality that hasn't changed much at all.

@achanssin I can predict 20 out of the last 5 recessions.
It was not like that when I was a kid. Algebra and fractions are bland compared to Calculus and Physics. I feel like I missed out...
Math is still not easy for me, but there is so much cool stuff on the other side of it, I don't care about the difficulty of learning it.
I was bad at math early on. So, naturally, I thought "I'm just not a math person" and avoided it. I missed A LOT of cool, interesting stuff.
Don't get me wrong, it's not *easy*, but it's not incomprehensible. I get it. I get what's happening. I like it.

@MailleMaam That's confirmation bias.
Availability bias: The tendency to take wrong info over no info. Or, worse, take wrong info over right info if too much effort required.
@TheKateGentile Read foreign news. Read financial news. Listen to the other side. Make an informed conclusion without getting angry.
Saying is not ur job to pursue truth, but responsibility of ur chosen cable venue to supply "the right facts" will always make you a pawn.
Shouting you can't trust one news site's slant while you rely on another's blend of spoonfed bullshit is not a defense for polarized sloth.
One tweets me, "But CNN!" The other, "But FOX!" But nothing. YOU. Do your homework. Compare stories. Compare facts. Be proactive.
This cannot persist in democracy that wishes to be "great". Suppression of news is not "giving power back to the people." it's the opposite.
Regardless of who's in power, news professionals/outlets cannot be dismissed as fake simply because they're critical of those in power.
One requires the listener/reader to be discerning and engaged. The other requires the listener/reader to hear/read only what interests them.
Yes, there is fake news. But there's a difference between fabricated lies for page clicks and reporters debating the establishment's facts.
@robneyer Nice picture of the crowd at Trump's inauguration.

Politics aside, Trump's first press conference was one of the worst examples of communication I've ever witnessed at any level of power.
@DrewGROF A solid point. And they would. And he would send their jobs abroad.
If you expect Trump to make logical sense commensurate to his powerful position‚Äîno matter what side you're on‚Äîyou're fooling yourself.
I dawns on me that the man we elected president, would not‚Äîafter having his online presence evaluated by HR‚Äîbe considered a safe hire.

@transscribe Awesome. Thanks for the consultation offer ;-) And thanks for not telling me to go to hell for writing that article.
@ihavearashmadan i'm starting to think SPXS is looking juicy to hedge with, so is NUGT. Utilities are looking cheaper....
@ihavearashmadan I think I'm a member of that shadow stat list :-)
@ihavearashmadan Also, inflation was near 15% upon his entrance to power, and the country was crippled by Carter's stagflation.
@ihavearashmadan At that time, derivatives trading and financial markets didn't account for this large a portion of the GNP.
I worry we're setting the stage for more financial power plays and income inequality, screaming "CHINA!" to get folks to look the other way?
Deregulating the industry that makes up nearly 30% of our GNP off leveraged derivatives doesn't seem like a recipe for blue collar jobs?
So far I don't see how Trump's appointments could help blue collar interests. I do see how they could help banks and income stratification.
@heelsonthefield I know mine is not the popular take, and I own that. I also own I'm in no position to tell people what to take offense to.

@simmonssteve I don't see those two things as directly correlated, or indicative of future results. But interesting none the less.
@MilcoxS I'm sorry you felt that way.
@MilcoxS Does Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, Bosom Buddies or any other gender juxtaposition make you feel the same? Honestly curious.
@MilcoxS I'd be less upset by men in dresses than women in Hooters outfits. One is a joke, the other is a serious job?
The "Jackie Robinson's sport" argument feels unfair/false correlarly since dress up day and nationwide segregation aren't on the same scale.
Thing is, I just don't see the offense factor. But I also don't see how new rules propels the MLB to the front of inclusion or anti bullying

But the biggest farce is, next year, when I don't show an MLB/Book/TV swing in earnings, I can get the loan because then I'm safe (!?!?)
So bad that a loan officer for Wells Fargo (go figure) advised me to lie on my current P&amp;L to get passed this automated screening hurdle.
Not bragging. I've been been both broke and well to do. I'm just citing a fact that screening on reported earnings swings is a bad bias.
The loan screening system does not help independent contractors who see massive swings in income year to year, but save effectively.
The irony: I have an excellent credit score and enough cash to buy the house clear (for my parents) yet I can't be qualified for a 50k loan.
In 2014, I made book and television contract money. Since then, I'v made average worker money. Banks see the drop and refuse to lend.
You may or may not find this humorous/pathetic, but, I can't get a loan... Because I made too much money in 2014.

I guess if you're an MLB team, you're worried I'd write about the experience or something... which is valid: I probably would.

I'd coach or work for a baseball team. Would love to help MiLB players get the most of their talent and lives no matter the end result.
I admit, I get a little jealous when former players get hired to front office roles based mostly on MLB exp and not education.

@black_bile Damn... so am I. #opportunitywasted.
Optimal scenario: use him as Zobrist styler rover. Jays can later replace a salary hog with him in coming seasons. More moves like this, plz
@creosports Yeah, but his main skill set is infielder. And it's easier to put power/platoon in an outfield spot.
The plot twist is, when Lourdes Gurriel Jr. is big league ready in 17 or 18, he replaces who? Donaldson, Tulo, or Travis?
@creosports You'd have to find a spot for him as he's Infielder behind Tulo, Donaldson and Travis. Most likely spot starts during DL time.
@jessespector @Mets Sign us both for a package deal ;-)
Lourdes Gurriel Jr. is a great get for the #Jays. Creates a replacement pipeline for other infielders and addresses depth mandate.
@ScottyMacThinks @TSN1050Radio Uh, I'm shocked you didn't ask me!?
Enough. I hope your side won for all the right reasons, my side lost but was not unheard, and that soon we stop talking in terms of sides.
@YeahVeets no it's not, you know how many people feel that way here right now? Unless he doesn't get sworn in it won't stop.

@LottOnBaseball Then, respectfully, go on and shove the "imaginary" commentary up your ass while we remaining souls sort this shit out.
@TophervonEsh @JessicaValenti I understand the frustrations that got him here, but my god did that come with some heavy trades...
@LottOnBaseball John, I didn't elect the guy. I didn't  support him, and I'm horrified. You have friends down here, or at least you did.
@TophervonEsh @JessicaValenti You need not tell me what to be. I will be as I choose.
@lamgary @SRowntreeNews No. I think most of them can figure that out.
@LottOnBaseball Thanks, John. Good to know you have our backs.
@TophervonEsh @JessicaValenti I do. I really do. But it's part of the package of Trump. If Hillary won, you'd say we supported a liar, etc..

I need to chill &amp; respect your views. We vote for a reason. I should have listened to the other side more and maybe I wouldn't be so shocked
Sorry, all. I'm generalizing. I'm frustrated. I'm not respecting the thoughts and views and vote motivations of all my followers.
@sgtkelley absolutely. Politics shouldn't divide, even thought they so often do.
@sgtkelley you think other countries and their people can make that distinction?
I was really hoping we'd be a leader in a wolrd that has become more isolationist. But, damn, it sure doesn't feel that's our desire.
@rx7outkast Oh, don't limit it to just those options.
@rx7outkast I hope so.
Electing trump is like screaming to the world  we're a country full of scared, xenophobic, racists, not brave, accepting democracy lovers.
@rx7outkast @KenTremendous you think this guy can help you? His election will mark the recession that unemploys you
@desodes it won't be the end of the world. The market will recover. But the damage will be intense local and globallly.

This is what happens when you assume, America.
@tdub_28 yes, but it's what's really happening. So easy with the sexists accusations.
@therealfoz Yes. But you can't tell morons they're morons...
I think it's pretty telling how disliked the candidates are when you make an antichrist joke and no one is sure who you were referencing.
@tdub_28 They're seriously doing this. Why is this sexist?
Literally waiting to see if America just elected the Antichrist and my wife and her besties are nattering about facial cream over zinfandel

@DSzymborski Ah, yes, the baseball. I remember it from dusty old manuscripts detailing it's arcane traditions...
But would you bat with a hockey stick, a bat, or something new? And would the pitcher just slap shot the ball at you...
@Rojodi This must happen. Add robots in someplace and I would die of an overdose on this.
Canada needs to play more baseball on ice. Baseballcapades, or something. Then we'd have the best of both worlds. #marketinggenius

I was able to snag some video from the Cubs locker room celebration: https://t.co/n9dg9hb6TD
Bill Murray only wants to hang out with me during the good times. But when I need him around to help fix a sink, he ditches me.
Do not ask for whom the goat bleats.  It bleats for thee.
Few hours ago I was celebrating the Cubs curse breaker with Bill Murray on field. Now I'm fixing the sink in my kitchen... Bill is not here.
I talked with the goat today about the enormity of the Cubs win, he said "this is our ti-i-i-i-i-me!" Then he ate my notepad.
I have to fight back the tears when I think of how many proud Chicago goat owners can finally walk their goats, shame free, in the city.
Just getting home from the game, and what a game it was! So happy for the Cubs. So happy for Zozo. Magical night I Was blessed to be part of
Heyward just swung at a 40 ft curveball. Twice. At this point, one wonders if they should just blindfold him and yell swing from the bench.
Ben Zobrist, perennially clutch.
I'm sorry, but, what the hell was that, Baez? What the hell was that!? YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE A STAR AND YOU (BLEW A)  BUNT!??
Just contemplating how many newborns will be named Rajai this coming year, should the Indians pull this off.
Stage is now set for a hero. The best of baseball is happening right before our eyes. Who will pull the sword from the stone first?
The journalists now ice the "curse breaker" narrative and switch back to the "Maddon loses game 7 in game 6" script...
JR Smith will now take his shirt off at all Indians games.
And just like that, Rajai Davis becomes a household name. Touch em all, Rajai...
Cody Allen now throwing baseballs at a catcher in a bullpen. #moreanalysis
Miller is... mortal?!?
Not a fan of Lester relieving before it happened, so not a fan of it now. Just because you have a toy doesn't mean you have to use it.
the Baseball Reaper is asking for a price check on an Indian's foam finger in the gift shop.
Kluber: 57 pitches, 36 strikes... no Strikeouts. Miller will most assuredly change that, but is it to late now?
That's the net effect of short rest. His composure is still Terminator-esque, but his stuff is now lift-able, and the Cubs are very familiar
In the first inning, Steve Phillips and I both agreed Kluber's arm a little lower than usual, and his stuff is floating a touch more.
@undergroundtex @bruce_arthur No, Madison sure didn't.
@BaseballRuben From shallow left? No, that's gutsy.
That is a gutsy send. Wow. I'll bet Maddon's stock portfolio is breathtaking.
@nollmatt You're speaking my language.
You kinda have to get Lester‚Äîif you do it‚Äî in early because if you don't, you're begging for a short game train wreck late.
@nollmatt I'd say hello but I'm in the media section doing "work" (free ice cream up here).
John Lester is throwing baseballs at a catcher in the visitor's bullpen. #Analysis
@nollmatt We weren't in the same class, though ;-)
@jeffguy10 @Indians @Cubs Yes, Kluber's arm action a little low. Cubs lift a lot.
Might be cheaper to come to Cleveland, get scalped tickets, stay the night, and watch game 7 then buy tickets and try to park in Chicago...
So many Cubs fans here that it feels like they out number Cleveland fans. Actually, if you think about the price power parity...
@kzesz It changed my life forever.
@robneyer Your mother deserves a signed copy!
That made me laugh. But it's true. They're fine people. I told them they raised possibly the most genuine man ever to play the game.
Met Zobrist's parents last night. Knew me as "the guy who wrote that book. It says Gospels on the cover, but it's not a book for mother."
@BootMcGoop Thanks, Kyle!
@j_ryan66 Doesn't help him.
@HOVG Sounds fun. Love to. Hope I can live up to the shows high quality.
Was really great to catch up with @TylerKepner @RGriffinStar @thehazelmae @TBTimes_Rays and meet @JuliannaZobrist 's in-laws.
@j_ryan66 Depends on the lead size. If Kluber beats to the heart of the Cubs order twice, he'll be a hero in Cleveland forever
I'm very lucky, and sometimes my body chemistry doesn't let me realize how lucky I am. If you're in that boat, you're not alone.
@robneyer Thanks Rob. You're a real genuine gentleman and I wish I let you know that more.
I hope i can share tomorrow with all of you, and I hope we can all enjoy it together.
I don't understand why depression works the way it does. It doesn't care about your dream moments. I just wanted to share that...
It's amazing. A real dream to reality. Got to do that all today and, honestly, I was so depressed and anxious I almost didn't go...
I get to go to game 7 of the WS. Enjoy best seats. Go into locker rooms. Meet with players. Talk with family. Walk on field. Do television.

@ScottyMacThinks Yes, but Tomlin can hit... for a pitcher... which is a thing.
@benzobrist18 Good luck in the WS! Living vicariously through you: no pressure ;-) Hope you and the fam enjoy the town/moment/ride.
@CLETalkingHeads Thanks guys, always love coming on with you. I promise I'll let you talk next time ;-)
Trying to think of a time in recorded history when a husband has offered his wife a back rub and been answered, "no."
Why don't toilets have garbage disposals built in?
@ScottyMacThinks They're just cleaning up the remains of Trevor Bauer.
So torn. Friends with Maddon and Zobrist‚Äîtwo of my all time fav baseball people. But, I live in CLEV OH area, and victory helps the town.
The chainsaw runs on fuel, and that fuel is love, honey.
Currently, I'm trying to convince my wife that the game Doom is like a chick-flick, but in video game form.
Funny how people interpret the phrase "learn the market value of an asset" as "definitely should trade whilst cackling maniacally."
@The_Road_Guy said shop, not trade.

@MikeBeauvais I Read that! I subscribe!
As a tweep points out, US isn't the only place that is shifting to a protectionist stance on economic policy. I hope US doesn't follow suit.
@MikeyJ_79 That's true. And it's frightening.
A global economy is a reality.  We'll have to work with other counties, and they us to keep it stable now. Pointing fingers fixes nothing.
If you want to help American workers, help them pivot faster. Reduce education costs, increase training initiatives for advanced jobs.
My economic plan: manufacturing jobs won't came back, especially if min wages go up. We're a developed economy. We'll automate or export.
.@ddcoletti Sadly, yes.
Trumps economic ideas don't reflect the nature of the global economy, and his comparisons are to economies at different development stages.
@TroyNo1 Justin Trudeau‚Äîlooks like Joel Osteen

@scottandrewb oh, always.
Want to give a shout out to those Canadians who made sure I was registered to vote and greatly cared about me doing so. #respect.
@Garrestotle Fries, gravy, cheese, and pulled pork‚Äî Silly name but, come one, that's crack for an American.
@Thornbury55 @tsnmikehogan Our craft beer lineup is soooo much deeper.
@tsnmikehogan Done and done.
No, seriously, thanks for having me, Canada. It's always a treat to visit and cover my former team.   Also, if Trump wins, can I move here?
This 2016 postseason coverage was great. Never had so much fun getting mercilessly ravaged for my opinions by strangers on the internet.
"Fred, look what you've done..."  Given the debaters, I'm not sure Fred knows how to take that.
Now for the main event: the 3rd US presidential debate. I'm confident we'll see more slugging in this match than the ALCS final.
Cheer up, Toronto, the Argos could still beat the Browns.
@stevehut @6Troyers The team record was set in 2002. They weren't even the most in baseball this season. Try again.
Oh, baseball, you're are so damn cruel sometimes.
@stevehut @6Troyers Sorry, you're right: because the Jays once struggled in other games, Miller is terrible.
@stevehut @6Troyers No. Miller is devastating. 11 batters faced. 8 K's and a 1 pitch double play.
Slay the beast or go home.
@JefferyMay13 @ODogandNoodles Why are you talking crap to me?
10th grounded into a double play of the postseason... At least they're consistent.
Coco's brother Tuco took a very different career path...
@twennyaits Your baseball? Ha. Hahahahaha....
Ryan "Skinny, younger Mark Buehrle" Merritt.
Lindorable. #Jays
Merritt's arms have got to be tired after a full game of stretching his hands over his head, over and over and over and over...
@ODogandNoodles I love your work, too.
.@ODogandNoodles No, he should have accused the MLB for being a puppet of the Hillary Clinton political machine.
Merritt's boots look pretty unshaken to me. #Jays

@jdemo67 They do not. Cleveland gets more runners and has scored more.
Blue Jays have grounded into the most DP's in 2016 at 153, and, not surprisingly, the most in the postseason at 9.
@JPogubila @TSN1050Radio Assumes Sanchez is back frequently, pitching for post season squads.
@JPogubila @TSN1050Radio I don't think so. It's too early to tell, he's not on a normal routine, and he's a rookie. Also...
Miller is in, so... See everybody back here at 4pm tomorrow?
Bauer: "Wearing blue tonight, boys. That way if I start gushing blood out of my throwing hand, I can mask it my uniform."
@Pringles519 @BlueJaysUmp Clearly the jays are losing because of that pitch...
@JefferyMay13 yup.
Watch your fingers, y'all, because Ryan Goins *is an RBI machine!
The seal has been broken!
@ABabip Drone ain't no country I ever heard of.
@curby1980 Struggle with your command to the point holding the runner is irrelevant.

Jays VS Otero https://t.co/wYo4uhu6ps
https://t.co/UiRNccExKg
That's a lot of blood... Curt Schilling, eat your heart out.
Bauer surprisingly not feeling lightheaded...
@dougdirt24 Not online, no.
Has Trevor Bauer been asked any questions about a possible SkyNet connection?
After getting the benefit of that swinging strike‚Äîwhich was a clear strike‚ÄîI really don't want to hear any more inferences from Joey Bats.
@Harvey75410 You were saying?
I only bring up the Stroman thing because of long layoff‚Äîtakes you out of your routine, makes the adrenaline feel more intense.
@gecomm Slow down, deep breaths, let the adrenaline dissipate.
X Factors to watch early: Stroman too amped up and his control suffering. Watch for signs of a rushed delivery. Hopefully a none-issue.
@bjcoombs @SportsCentre First, I doubt that. Second, I wonder if it has anything to do with him saying umpires are bias and unfair?
@LZone To be fair, after this many sequels, that actually might be a viable option.
.@ScottyMacThinks I assume you mean the guys in the outfield who are pretending to converse to avoid picking up that ball? #probablypitchers
@Tyemazing123 Much like life has already, I too would embarrass you.
Talking with @Kara_Wagland about "cheating" to beat Andrew Miller https://t.co/UirSxfXkr7
All I'm saying is: https://t.co/RfNEKZbts0
@Pringles519 Oh, the data says the Blue Jays clearly should have won?
I'd avoid such an insinuation and instead focus on what I can control, knowing that I've also benefited from the phenomena in my career.
True: strikes zone's move and we don't have robot umpires. But saying the game is rigged in favor the Indians descredits their hardwork.
@zachrymer It sure the hell is.
@davieskyle Should be, but I don't necc trust pitch tracker. Catchers frame pitchers, context, arm slot... Adaptable teams win.
@fakeBobbyDuff In the post season, anything that works I approve.
@zachrymer Oh man, this just made my night.
@HardballFacts Yes, but I do not count the Indian's pitching as an accomplice in their scheme.
I recommend that Jays hitters pray to Crom before their coming at bats, and if he does not listen, then to hell with him.
The "gap" in called strikes is a fact of baseball life. Happens every game for one side or another. Is no basis on which to justify failure.
I agree with the @Indians social media account on this front. Less implying, more hitting, Jays. https://t.co/wmgnMVU2wJ
@SirForensic By the way, I highly respect your profession. That's a tough field. I sucked at accounting in my MBA, for whatever reason.
@SirForensic I want them to win. I get paid when they do! But they must figure out Miller if they want to win‚Äîthey'll see him again soon.
@SirForensic I think it's difficult to criticize a team when they're the monopoly‚Äîespecially form a former employee. It's not personal...
@SirForensic 10 Batters faced = 8 K's. You're an accountant, follow the numbers.
Putting Andrew Miller in perspective:  https://t.co/xZpbOwBXSh
@olferrt Please, like you need an excuse to do that.
@CapNwhiskey Hairoids.
@JosephKimmons @KateBeirness I picked the Jays to win the series. When you make Josh Tomlin look like Cy Young, you earn criticism.
Live by the home run, die by the home run.
If you're going to make Josh Tomlin look like Roy Halladay circa 2010, then you might as well not even come to the plate against Miller.
Andrew Miller could tell the Blue Jays what he's going to throw at this point and they'd still strike out and blame the umpire.
Brandon Guyer: former teammate, great dude. I would wave a towel for him.
SO MUCH TOWEL WAVING! IT'S WORKING! I'M MAKING THE TEAM WIN BY WAVING THIS TOWEL! TOWEL-TOWEL-TOWEL-TOWEL! DON'T FORGET TO BRING A TOWEL!
Miller, despite donating half of his torso to science, is still an amazing pitcher.
In his defense, Bauer probably has a really bad-ass drone, you guys.
@_timHatt_ Years of building up immunity. We start with small doses of Iocane powder...
Any time a hitter bunts to beat the shift, no matter where you are, you can hear someone scream, "SEE, WHY THEY DON'T DO DAT MOAR!"
@JustmeElc @SportsCentre @BlueJays Buster Posey is one of the best. Jose Molina (any Molina) is the best. But Martin is very good.
Apologies. Here is the catching framing link. We could only scratch the surface... https://t.co/GkkFVgtnuO
@BenBadler You need a vacation. Well done!
@jaysbandwagon You want to say I'm a bad analyst, you're wrong. You want to say I'm a bad prophet, fine, I'll take it.
@jaysbandwagon I didn't. I picked based on the poor finish the Jays had. Worst September of all contenders, terrible RISP + Rangers strength
@jaysbandwagon You're saying I should base my picks on fan sentiment, and not the 162 games worth of data driven results?
@jaysbandwagon I think you're mistaking prophecy and analytics. Most analysts had Texas in the WS.
@brendankennedy_ And you should apologize.
@brendankennedy_  No. He went into the Minors for the Jays. Made his MLB debut as a Jay‚Äîtherefore, he is a product of their system's dev.
@SportsCentre @BlueJays @Indians Trying to figure out why that tweet had #TSNHockey on it?
@GouldenJonah @SportsCentre @BlueJays @Indians Who do I make the check payable to?
@JefferyMay13 @CLETalkingHeads @Radiodotcom Tito has more tools. Gibbon's gut has got him this far. Coaching edge is a function of results.
@altev1 3.68 since the break. That's great. 5 before, in 1st half. Will pitch on 10 days rest... Potentially 15 if rotation resets. Goodbye.
@stevesbigtwits noted.
They also don't realize this is the first step in Canada's invasion. Cleveland offers a strategic foothold to the US's soft, gooey center.
They don't realize I do this professionally. Aside from a past (small) history wt the club, I am unbiased, and only hope for good baseball.
I keep getting lovely messages from my friends/family/aquaintences in Ohio telling me that "my" Jays are going to lose hard to the Indians.

Tin Cup Whisky: BC Nothing says manhood like getting loaded and climbing up the side of a treacherous cliff face with your blitzed friends.
Mountain climbing and drinking whiskey... wtf?
@JustmeElc Thanks!
@UDevilBlueDevil Safer, because he felt there was a good chance I'd run the wrong direction and include a double or triple play.
@UDevilBlueDevil Correct. Barry Zito took one look at me and decided it was safer to put me on base...
@mhstone32 @gregorMLB If facing Boston, I like Sanchez. If facing the Indians, I like Stroman.
@BIGZinTO @BlueJays @Indians @RedSox Cleveland would be my choice just because days off cooling a team down is a real thing.
Well, the Red Sox are off to a real Hayhurst of a start...
At the TSN studio watching the Red Sox/Indians game. Pulling for the Indians (I'm from northern Ohio), but I don't want Oritz to retire...
@Craigers88 Thanks. I appreciate your taking the time to say something positive.
@SavageGilles @AustonPowers34 I Think you mean, when I do get promoted for being so awesome even the people who hate me, tweet me.
@AustonPowers34 Never said that. Said he was tough and K's lots of batters. Specifically said he's not invincible.
@DSzymborski Clearly you've not been mountain climbing. The Mountain King will not allow you to summit unless you pass his whiskey test.
@cresswell88 Sure. It's nice to have a buffer.
....comes true yet again.
That old saying about lead off walks coming 'round to score...
Factoid: Last 2 times the Rangers lost by a 9 run margin in the post they've come back to win the next contest. I'm sure Happ is terrified.

Like watching Marco Estrada make hitters look silly? Here is your zen: https://t.co/cCA6XKpFuq https://t.co/t2RQrSzbGg
@ZachLev Interesting....
Total class for Estrada to say it doesn't matter‚Äî&amp; it really doesn't in the face of a win‚Äîbut, dang, you know he'd love to have finished it.
Spare me the "bad back, so take him out"... at 98 pitches and a 9 run lead? Could have taken him out in the 7th if that's your argument...
Estrada showing more emotion now on the bench then he did the entire game...
Unreal. If I was Estrada, I'd be FURIOUS. No Blue Jay's pitcher has thrown a complete game all year... What a way to break that trend.
I predict Trump to *win* the US presidential election.   You're welcome, Earth.
At this point, just tell me who you want to lose and I'll predict them to win.
At this point, If a Rangers player got crushed by a stray anvil, I'd not bat an eye.
Man, Hamels really Hayhurst'ed the crap out of that 3rd inning...
... and also, barbecue.
They're in Texas, so Pillar is out... and Jose Bautista is also out. #Jays #Rangers #ALDS
*They're* not saying boo, They're saying booo-urns. #jays #rangers #ALDS2016
Gosh, I wonder who Dennis Eckersly is rooting for...
As predicted, all the broadcasting media wants, right out of the gate in pregame, is: who is going to fight who first? #Jays
Forgot I'll be getting two Thanksgivings again this year! Thanks, Jays. Canadian Thanksgiving pairs well with post season baseball.
Changing up the game: https://t.co/5dC4gr2Bii
@TorontoDGE It's a great rotation matchup, not doubt, but bullpen/bench is usually the decider and edge in depth goes to Rangers.
@TorontoDGE I try not to.
@JakeWoodburn @NickMann_ I would have shown the ERA, it's worse.
@_jaythompson I took it down because it was selling like, one copy a year... more expensive to have on iTunes than not!
Them: "YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU PROJECTED, HAYHURST, YOU PATHETIC, NO TALENT LOSER"  Me: "People read my stuff!!! High five!"
@McGuire_Mike God, why buy that in the first place.
Have some respect, Toronto fans! Beer purchased at stadium prices is too expensive to waste.
@hellojohnhere He was backing up 3rd in spirit.
Trumbo. Doing that thing he does.
Kevin Pillar. Doing that thing he does.
@bobloblah1980 No.
Storman, I give you full permission to keep proving me wrong. He's locked in now... but, the line up is about to turn over.
Bautista telling all off-season suiters, "Show me the money!"
If Harold Reynolds *were* here... "Turf! The Jays play on Turf. Turf-turf-turf-turf-turf, Tom, Turf-turf-turf. Canadians also play hockey."
I can't watch Jays post season baseball without Harold Reynolds. It's just not the same...
@ArthurBignell @Todd___Smith @jgalls23 @SportsCentre I'm actually hoping for a chorus of "IN YOUR FACE, HAYHURST!" tweets.
No fruit cup issues today. But the omelette line.... it was pure carnage.
Still scratching my head about Stroman starting. Here's why: https://t.co/S7At0q5le4
Well, shucks. I hope it works. I like covering my old team on television... I'd like to make a month of it. Go get'em, Stro.
A contact RHP vs a RHP mashing, power skewed team in a single game death match? Groundballs are still balls in play (assuming sinker sinks)
A free swinging O's club that struggles against lefties versus a K heavy LHP with WC experience throwing to his AStar making catcher....?
I like Stroman. I want him to win. I just don't get the logic here. Liriano is the "path of least resistance" start for potential success.
@LJ_Rader @TSN_Sports All pitchers save for Sanchez will most likely be on call in the pen.
@UDevilBlueDevil Nothing is scared to me.
People are afraid of me now, afraid I'll snatch their food away. They eat like prison inmates, hovering defensively over their plates...
I've no answer. Only shame. Guilt is my buffet. Destroyed, I turn back to my table with my ill-gotten cup of mostly hard, unripped melon...
I explain that I probably won't eat the fruit cup; that she should take it back, it's hers. "Then why did you steal it!?" She demands.
I stand an island of disgrace in a sea of hungry, irritated, alarm prank victims... I don't even like most of what's in the fruit cup.
She looks hard at me and shakes her head in disgust. At some point during the 6 ft between the buffet &amp; my table, I've ruined it...
I offer to return the fruit cup. I've not touched it. The fruit is pristine. I carry it back, apologizing as I go. She looks the cup over...
A tiny, "passionate" woman is screaming at me for stealing her fruit cup. She made it. I stole it. People are staring...
And I assume it's a premade cup, for early risers, It was so perfect. I put on a plate, take it back to table. Moments later...
At the morning breakfast buffet, I go to make my fruit cup and see there is one already made. It's early (see fire alarm tweet)...
Got lucky this morning. The jerk who pulled the [prank] fire alarm at the hotel waited until 6am instead 3am. Very considerate.
@layner04 Probably the later. Canada really only watches baseball when the Jays play, statistically speaking...
@Tony71263 Sure, but the 10% who aren't... they are my treasures.
I would love to switch Gibby with Lord Grantham and see how both scenarios played out... "Edith is a little snake bit, but she's a grinder."
@layner04 @TSN_Sports Actually, statistically speaking, a larger % enjoy it, but the slice that doesn't is more vocal ;-)
Fair warning, @NabilKarimTSN: I'm a hugger.
Though some could argue that Hugh Bonneville would manage his bullpen better...

Such a loss for baseball, the Marlins, and all who loved passionate, genuine, exceedingly talented athletes. Rest peacefully, Jose Fernandez

@ssfaulkenberry You mean defeat an ideology that feeds of western aggression by being more aggressive so US born legals can sleep better?
@alan_keiper I really think we'll look back at this time in our history and be embarrassed.
@ssfaulkenberry I hear you. But I believe our nation is strong enough to save war-torn lives and offer sanctuary, and still remain safe.
@Brainsonwall Wait, when I did I say you need to convert and die for my beliefs? I'm sorry, I think you're exploding in wrong direction.
@ssfaulkenberry I can defend my beliefs, which are mine, not a party's, but you're s-typing me into a group u clearly dislike.
@ssfaulkenberry I'm sorry? Roughly 85% of refugees are women and children. And even then the vetting process is incredibly stringent.
Uhg. Tweeting about politics reminds me why no one should ever tweet about politics...
@ssfaulkenberry Whatever you say, dude.
@Brainsonwall Oh, man, someone's feelings are hurt. Have some Skittles, they'll cheer you right up. #tastetherainbow
@dwbudd True, it's not. It's a diverse nation that has lived under the mantra of courageous right to freedom. Sad to see it so fearful.
Excuse my Christian bent here, but, loving/helping others at the possible expense of your life has always been a bedrock of the faith.
@dwbudd I'm fine with that.
shutting our doors, turning our backs, and painting with broad, discriminatory brushes makes us something far worse.
we perpetuated aid, humanitarianism, saving lives, acceptance, and freedom. Our acceptance makes us vulnerable, that's true, but...
The thing about the Skittles analogy question, to me, is, yes, I believe I live in an America that would take a handful, if it meant...
@ssfaulkenberry You think that the Skittles analogy is accurate?
OK, Mr. Trump Jr., but if I told you the chances of you dying in a car crash were 1 in 171, would you still let your chauffeur drive you?

I usually wait until mid product cycle to purchase a gaming platform (IE: PS4, Xbox). So, MGS 5 has been out for a while b4 I could play it.

@rytypey89 Interesting twitter handle, Singer.
Honestly, all fan sentiment aside, at the current caliber of Jays play, do you see them:
Get all the bad luck, bad mojo, ugly play, out tonight. All of it. That's the only silver lining, if it's even real at all.
Stop losing....
Stop losing, Jays.
I've now seen Hell's Bells both live in person and played as Trevor Hoffman's intro when I was a member of his bullpen. Both are special.
Turns out Axl wasn't so bad. I mean, singing for ACDC doesn't exactly require world class vocalist training... Still, Angus IS the show.
Actually, if there was a contest for most flaccid, saggy white people, this concert might give the RNC a run for its money.
At AC/DC concert. Same place as RNC. Opening act almost done. Just caught my first whiff of pot. Pretty sure the RNC had more by this point.
Have to admit. Axl sounds terrible sining AC/DC so... oh well. Free tickets.
Going to see AC/DC tonight in concert. So many locker room/batting practice songs, so few chords. #aintnoisepolution.
In my expert opinion, the Blue Jays should stop losing. #thatswhytheypaymethemediocrebucks

Some hitter somewhere needs to come up to bat to the Stranger Things intro theme.
@jootsyfruit43 @kyleclarke_014 Sanchez to start Aug 31 versus O's. Then skip a start later in September with goal of starting in playoffs.
@FraserPxP doubtful.
Dickey won't pitch in playoffs, so Thole won't catch/hit. Navarro is a switch hitter, solid back up catcher, with club/staff exp. +3

@dherbert8 Please, any monkey could play the outfield  ;-)
@dherbert8 Hey, when he sends his pitchers to the outfield instead of taking them out of the game, you have to have a little respect.
I want my cookie now. ALL OF THEM.
@RobertSpence_ all of them
It's the best choice the team has, will help Estrada's back, Stroman's (exact same situation as Sanchez) arm, and Sanchez. It's a triple win
Hands down, rest and controlled schedules keep pitchers healthier longer. This helps ALL Jays rotation arms, especially Stroman.
Cool: I pushed for a 6 man rotation 3 months ago for Jays/Sanchez as best option for health upside and overall production value.

@joeymwilson @TSN_Sports @BlueJays lol.
@joeymwilson @TSN_Sports @BlueJays I know that you might want to get that lump checked. Also, your diet is low in Omega 3's.
@joeymwilson @TSN_Sports @BlueJays many things, actually.
@CMB1979 Yes it would.
@stevemaich Thanks, Scuba! Miss you, pal!
@MattPmpm You mean the Cubs? Gladly, I would.
Look at what just came in the mail! https://t.co/TIAssuBBFm
I'm just saying, if you're betting on scenery change to reinvigorate strugglers, who has the better upside?
@Thornbury55 I dunno. Numbers are both bad. One's got a 5 ERA and the other a 6. M's could get lucky on Storen's bounce back.
@Pucks99 Because JB needs to be in the middle of the order, not the top. BJ's a worse hitter, but a better lead off or 9 hole.
Jays: Hey M's, wanna put different uniforms on a pair of struggling duds and call it "trying" M's: Squeeeee! My favorite kind of trade!
In studio, ready to tape my wisdom (rambling nonsense) about the Upton trade. https://t.co/95tdMHNa5v
Actually, since Padres brought fences in in 2014 (13?) Petco has played offensively neutral. So, that offensive bump is little misleading.
Plus, Jays get a humbled former ALE star, and the late game power upside ain't bad either. But... A pitcher would be sooo much better.
Also. Best base stealing threat now. He's. Role player. Gap filler. Could shift Bautista to DH, EE first, Smoak PH. Or late inning speed/d+
Sorry all, we lumped Pillar into the outfield upgrade category. Upton clearly not better than Pillar. But 2nd best def outfielder now.
@dorgal Thanks for both.
@moxxjason Thanks. Either way, I'll write about it.

You know, back when Cleveland was originally tabbed for the RNC, I worried Cleveland wouldn't be "good enough"... Now it's the opposite.

Yes, given that it's almost an auto-plunking, it should be an auto-ejection. May be worth it to Rangers. Or, they wait 'till play in TX.

Somewhere, Goose Gossage is angrily pecking out a scathing email on his Windows 98 machine about MLB's new slide rules...
Should baseball now expect soccer style theatrics at 2nd base every time there is contact of any kind? Should SS/2B run into the runner?
I think interpreting slide rule to this degree over reaches what it was meant to do, indeed, what Bautista COULD HAVE done in a close game.
Bautista did "grab" at 4sythes back foot. Not intentionally/maliciously. But new slide rule parameters met. So who did new rule "protect?"

@bydanielvictor @jessespector You make 9 cents?! *tsk*... Lucky...
@ErikSherman You. I know how the other guy does it. I want to know how writer write about other stuff with success.
@ErikSherman Hey Erik. How did you grow your writing career into something that was sustainable and conducive to your lifestyle?
@theTOguy I'm the PR Director for a software company. But I also do TSN analyst work as a PTJ. Finishing my MBA right now.
@JustinVanDaele 10 minutes? Man, you must really suck at using the internet.
@dfera81 @FredToucher Thanks, David!
I need some PR goals for my little company. Right now I feel like i'm just a content marketing mill. Looking for a little inspiration...
@FredToucher You're welcome. Thanks for having me on!
@DWillisET @Toucherandrich Thanks, David.  I appreciate it.
@Bkosta13 Thanks, Brian.
@iamjoshfowler @Toucherandrich Thanks, all.
@EvanDrellich Congrats, dude.
@ChrisDeLuca my pleasure.
I'll check her contract.  https://t.co/qMirPSr1z1
One of my coworkers #LaRoched her kid to work today.
@brodskyme I'll take any inroads I can get!
How does one let the world know he is looking for a college coaching job? Or did I just do it?
@IAmTheRealGus yes and no. Yes, you're supposed to be in playing shape/but you can't enforce it. So, no, a player doesn't have to work out.
@IAmTheRealGus all year, and not sure I understand your 2nd question.
@frang4u uh? So you're telling me I have to get you a book?
@MikeKappel No problem
Dear God, another day of the "Drake Laroche #neverforget." Movement. I crush this here: https://t.co/9FDlTsYF5T

@davetung This is the internet. Sports entertainment. Opinion is the currency here. So, cut the pious BS and lecture elsewhere, meat.
@davetung Adult like? Even if you simply said "adult" it would still be a nebulous term  rooted in your biased definition.
@davetung Sorry, you're right: 14 year olds are fully functional adults that need no supervision.
Has anyone asked for Goose Gossage's take on this? #laroche.
@jeremylatzke Phenomenally stupid.
@BonzoBeckett Clearly.
let me see if I've got this straight:  1) Employer makes reasonable request about work/family boundaries...  2) WORLD ENDS   #LaRoche
I wrote a piece on it, but I write a lot of pieces. Gotta say, I'm really amazed at what an issue this total non issue has become. #laroche
@BonzoBeckett Suggestion: you could stop worrying about what I think.
@corey_wargo Do you really list yourself as a former D1 catcher... *sigh*.... Do you have dreams of being Drake Laroche?
@BonzoBeckett @BWheelerglobe Uh, lots of people fault her. I'm faulting her. I don't see. Not the same work structure, and not at all sexist
I agree. It's a good one.  https://t.co/H3QrVmymys
@BonzoBeckett @BWheelerglo If bitching is the equalizer here, then, well, consider this me calling BS on the CEO of Yahoo as well. We good?
@BonzoBeckett @BWheelerglobe Yahoo CEO mandates no work from home policy, builds private nursery in office, deny's privilege to employees...
@largeandbearded @LaurenceWHolmes Thanks!
Or is that just one of those things you agree to knowing no one takes their kid to 100% of the games. Kids have lives and school, right?
This whole "Laroche had an agreement" bit means nothing to me. He signed a contract with all his teammates? They all agreed to babysit?
Sorry, Adam, a Major League locker room is not a daycare. https://t.co/XXUsfoSApv

@THEstrome1 Thanks Dave!
I wish I was really good at baseball so I could get old and accuse it of devolving into a sham run by nerds &amp; sissies. Alas, I sucked...
So, what I'm hearing is: Batflip = Disgraceful.   Profanity laced tirade in national media venue = Playing the game the right way.  Got it.
If Jose Bautista's bat flip embarrasses  Latin players? Does Gossage's angry, swear riddled tirade embarrass white players?
I'd like to speak at this years national college baseball coaches convention. 1) How do I do that? 2) Is there such a thing?
@AmyVernon No problem. Kick its butt! We can talk later.
@AmyVernon You are my hero. I'd call you right now if that wasn't so absolutely creepy!
@AmyVernon I have a greyhound. All he does is sleep. I still take plenty of pictures though. I'm a sucker for dogs.
@AmyVernon *shucks* Well, sports end for all of us at some point... I like hearing how smart people do what they do. I thought I'd ask.
@AmyVernon Hey Amy. Huge, ridiculous question: How do I change my career into yours? Love your dog, btw--&gt; Huskies are such camera hogs.

@johnmanuelba Alrighty then. When do I interview?
@johnmanuelba Lol! Well, I have an MBA, MLB exp, a PMP, writing chops, video/camera savvy, and I currently do PR... would it be fun?
@johnmanuelba Really? I've been looking for a reason to move back to Durham, and I know a little something about writing and baseball ;-)
@johnmanuelba I see you're looking for an assistant editor at BA. Should I send my resume?
@jparencibia9 I'm a hypocrite for making your life in sports harder. I've been where u were and it sucks. I respect u and wish you the best.
@jparencibia9 I'm sorry my words hurt you the way they did. I'm glad you got help and are in a better place. You're a strong, talented man.
@the_r_tanner Yes, caution. There are things that can end/make your career difficult there if you're not prudent.

You'll never guess: The Thundercats just went into the blackhole, and there is a computer in there, and its keeping the sword...
Oh man, he just did it! He just tossed the Sword of Omens into the blackhole... Well, it was a good run, Thundercats...
Blackhole is also red and glowing. Mum-Rah is about about to toss the Sword of Omens into the blackhole, Interstellar style.

@jeffweir2 yes, mobile and streaming content, which is easier to monetize now. Did it go that route because of $ or did $ cause that route?
@EvanDrellich Lots of new faces in camp this year, what's the game plan to assimilate the new culture in with the old, winning culture?
I wonder how long it will be before baseball stops pretending to be the common man's sport and starts being the rich man's...

Hey all, thanks for the insightful tweets RE: my dog. Today he's doing much better. I suspect anesthesia reaction. Seems to have dissipated.
My dog is healthy, 8 years old, went to vet for teeth cleaning. Was sedated. Now, periodically acts confused, disoriented.
Can't understand what's wrong with my dog. No visible ear damage. No blindness. But obviously there is something wrong? Any ideas?
My greyhound to vet 3 days ago. Now, sporadically, wanders the house as if hearing something that isn't there, confused and disoriented?
@kelliefriery Just let me know when.
@kelliefriery Hey Kellie, Nice to tweet you. @LZone will tell you who I am. We should chat about your magical IR powers.

@germanphile Yeah, its no fun. You know you shouldn't feel it but there it is and you have to face it. It looks so abnormal from the outside
@NUHF Onwards and upwards! Or something like that. I hope this opens other doors.
@germanphile It takes the taste and point out of things. You can't feel engaged in life. It's like being lost in your own reality.
When we talk about these issues openly, they become less taboo and divisive. They become relatable; less "them", more "us". #BellLetsTalk

Thanks for the help, all! I appreciate it. FYI, I still cover baseball so, if that's what you're here for, plz excuse these last tweets ;-)
I have a lot to learn, and believe me, I want to learn it, but, unlike baseball, feedback doesn't come the instant you let the ball fly.
I feel lost a lot. Shell shocked. I imagine a lot of athletes go through this when it finally hits home. Stellar yet brutal learning exp.

You guys, they said they'd put a Garfoose in the game if they got enough funding! https://t.co/pRFfUOzvML
@CSEGames @sportslogosnet @Count2Baseball This needs to happen!
@smallbiztrends hello SBizT, would you be so kind as to help me learn how to submit for your site?
@TechCocktail what's the best way to submit or pitch guest material to your site?
@Wilnerness590 ...You don't mind sharing the link in your twitter feed. You know how I like my odd baseball games. #fantasyfantasybaseball
Hey @Wilnerness590 Interested in a Fantasy Baseball board game made by a fellow Canadian? https://t.co/pRFfUOR7bl I'll get you a copy if...
@darylmandrews @CSEGames Well, I personally think @craigcalcaterra and @robneyer would love a free fantasy baseball board game.
@Minor_Leaguer @BKennedyStar But seriously, what a great guy. Just a great, great guy.
@Minor_Leaguer @BKennedyStar A natural mascot. He dresses up as a baseball player when he's at the Rogers Centre.
@dan_labbe I need to speak with you, my fellow newsy. What's a good time or number?
Here is a link to the game. Cool concept, great price, lots of KS only goodies. Made by Jays fans: https://t.co/pRFfUOzvML
Morning, tweeps. Before you get settled in for work, you might want to kickstart this cool #fantasyfantasybaseball board game by @CSEGames
@JayAhre @Rangers @darylmandrews @CSEGames That's true. Do you plan on having a Sam Dyson mummy in the game?
@boardsalive @darylmandrews @Linsaebear I appreciate your follow. And, yes, tonight I just played Quantum with friends. We should play!
.@boardsalive @darylmandrews Actually, I've known of it. I'm part of a board game group that meets weekly. I'm an alpha nerd‚Äîask David Price
@girlincode Awesome! I'm just a fan of the game idea, not the maker, but it's exciting for me, none the less.
Pardon me, Mr. @keithlaw, but I thought you might get a kick(starter) out of this:  https://t.co/pRFfUOR7bl #fantasyfantasybaseball
Jays fan makes well reviewed board game with a Ghoul doing Bautista's infamous bat-flip... it MUST be funded. https://t.co/hLLBVry1PO
@black_bile lol. I took my shot, and I missed.
@dmann1471 I blame Philadelphia plumbing...
@boardsalive @darylmandrews Thank you! Great Podcast, BTW!
Fantasy Fantasy Baseball! A great idea. I can't imagine it will be anything but awesome- check it out https://t.co/pRFfUOR7bl
@darylmandrews Thanks! I actually made an app mock baseball video game about steroids called Bush League-- your game is right up my alley!
@darylmandrews @CSEGames Consider the tweeting done. I'll start tomorrow and remind folks for the rest of your campaign. Happy to help!
@dmann1471 Sorry, dude. I have to keep some things secret ;-)
@darylmandrews I particularly like the Jose Bautista inspired Ghoul bat toss. I see what you did there...
@darylmandrews Daryl! When you want Fantasy Fantasy Baseball tweeted about, reviewed, or turned into an iPhone App, let me know! Good luck!
MT: Having trouble deciding who aged worse in SWTFA, Darth Vader or *Carrie* Fisher... The raspy voice is strong in the Vader family.
@BlakeCousins God I hope so.
Star Wars Review: Lots of nostalgia. Weak Plot. Weak villain. New heroes are awesome. BB8 is cute. Things exploded. Light Sabers. Wookies.
I think it's enjoyable. I just don't think it did enough new. Which may make you really happy or really "meh." I'm a very "meh," person.
I watched it all the way to the end before I walked out... That was to inform you that I just saw it, not that I stormed out disappointed.
@MOAB1972 Yes, actually.
Just walked out of Star Wars. Never been a huge fan of it.... Still not. I'm glad I saw it in theaters but I don't need to see it again.

@frang4u The key words here are, From the Bullpen Gospels....

@WesPhillips I'm sad you didn't invite me.
@taxgirl I genuinely have a respect for people who can write about dry subjects with voice and punch. Its a gift.
@taxgirl I rarely get that response ;-)  That Five Hot Tax issues blog you did = nailed it. Where are you, Corporate Tax Reform...?
@taxgirl as weird as it may sound coming from me, I love your stuff.
Frenchy, from the Bullpen Gospels, just signed with the Jays. Awesome. Him and Pickles, reunited!
I'm going to log that in our project tracker, next to my request for cherry dinosaur Jello Jigglers, and see if it gets done.
During a Co. meeting about a web page today, I said, "It's good, but needs more ninjas doing back flips on motorcycles with fireworks."

One of these IRS forms tells you how to write off Cy Youngs whose arm explodes year one of their contract, right? https://t.co/E1cXzKKsqD
My company wants me to put together a Crisis Mgt Plan. I asked if they want 1 chapter for Arencibia, Buchholz, and Price, or each their own?
@WesPhillips Still waiting for that job offer, Wes... ;-)
@TheGarfoose Thanks for Liking my tweets, I'm flattered. But you're an international superstar bombshell, and I'm a dork, so I'm suspicious?
Every time you click on one of my Patriot Software links, my co-workers freak out like I'm some internet wizard... pretty funny, actually.
@DMcWriterboy @AndrewStoeten Yeah, and if the Interest rate goes up and more dollars come out of circulation into savings.... gets worse.
@AndrewStoeten Until baseball pundits make habit of dragging team operations treasurers up onto the press podium, we'll never really know.
@infoblatt @BPbrewing Ohio isn't exactly known for it's spicy food and drink. Please send me some! I'm happy to pay.

@SmallBizLady can you teach me how to use my small biz to rule the world? At least a small island? I'd settle for my backyard, honestly...

Polarizing, fear-mongering, radicalizing and dehumanizing rhetoric... ISIS? Nope. Donald Trump. Bigotry does not equal a "strong America."
@Tsikbalichmaya @Bill_Veeck @TripleH Lol! That's awesome.
But Mark, Monsanto has a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to kill all of us. #Merica
@ZipRecruiter Oh, my company just likes it a lot! We would have hired the folks who did it--but it turns out that's you!
Those big name pitchers are coming off the market quickly. Considering the history, if Cueto went to the Jays, would you be happy or mad?
Vetting marketing companies has taught me more about marketing than an entire month of masters level classwork on the subject.
Have fun at winter meetings you guys... I'll be here... in my cubicle... living the dream....*lowers head, weeps*
@Stern1954 I have, twice now.
@Stuology101 No
@ddohertyjr I have no idea what I do either.
@JenmarkDigital yes. first part of the contract
@ddohertyjr Yup. What can you offer?
@Chris_Dimos They are great, how are you?
They offered "not cut into my baseball revenue stream" as part of the work agreement. Cool, huh? I walk outside and scream at radio hosts...
The place I work for is cool enough to let me keep doing radio, television, and writing for sports venues. That's pretty cool/rare.
Ross Atkins = non-factor for current players with guaranteed pay. For player dev, international scouting, and pres/GM relations, he's a +

@doug_yoder Awesome! Thanks. I'll follow you and you can DM all you want.
@TinaSturdevant Love to work with you again. Was on a contract. Then went to pitch based.
Sup, #techpint right down the road, in Canton, we're hiring dev's. Good culture. Good Benefits. Check us out:https://t.co/JPmhlvQxgA
@doug_yoder I would if I could. Can you give me deets?
@doug_yoder We're hungry and hiring. Full time, well paying, dev work.
@TinaSturdevant And, ironically, if you need talent... uh... I'm here ;-)
@TinaSturdevant Thanks!
@_GeoffYoung Thanks, though I wish I found something far from it during this time of year (and almost every other time of year, too).
If you're an available software developer, in the northeast Ohio area, I'm your new best friend. Tweet me, or your friend who is.

@CPritch71 No, worked against me. I'm getting my MBA and got my PMP and offered to start in low. It's a sacrifice.
@steelymatt Still exploring them, but it's a hard world to explore.
@mrmikedorval Please do.
@RobbScottArt dhayhurst@patriotsoftware.com
@CPritch71 Told the truth.
@CPritch71 did the link not work?
@jbennett2027 I would start a website and cover national stuff with an original voice, then try to catch on at a website.
@KoniHowie 26 million guaranteed dollars happy.

@coopersam Yeah, it can be a hard knocks town for young millionaires who don't perform.
More on why they Jays don't need to feel bad about Price's departure to Boston. https://t.co/6jSpkqeiZP
I have this odd hunch that David Price's media sensibilities will not do well in Boston... #Jays #RedSox
@jonahkeri Me too.
@gecomm The big guns!
@gecomm We have a team of copy writers that put articles into all of these and address industry wide concerns across multiple sites.
@gecomm We already do that, ha!
@robneyer this feels like something that should have a "safety word"
@mattlindner So, can I write for you now ;-)
@mattlindner So, yeah, if you want something like that, like this wild, humorous, frank, big potential, brave new world article, I got it.
@mattlindner the kind of stuff baseball players want, even if they don't know they want it when they're playing but fearful of the future.
@mattlindner but true, and they are eccentric. Not monocle eccentric, but close. Wild experience for me. Small, big growth = a thrill.
@mattlindner because we're not a startup. We're profitable, scalable, INVESTABLE. Met more Billionaires in last 5 days then in my life.
@JayRic77 Still am, yes.
@Stern1954 Are any of your peeps free to talk about some ad campaigning? I just dropped you a line on your website.
@mattlindner Yeah, we're a month from A+Reg fundraising and it's crazy exciting here and I'm not sure what separates us
@Costa_Tempus Thanks, dude! I;m hoping to get some connections/inroads for some coverage at biz media sites that cover my startup.
I'm trying to get more sites to write about my company now. After all these yeas of baseball, I'm a little lost on where to start?
@mattlindner So, in your expert opinion, how would I get my IPO into more business sites? Any advice on angles and hooks?
@mattlindner Sounds like a crazy transition. I'm just having trouble getting used to the dang 9-5 schedule! No more late nights...
@TouchEmAllJoe29 Follow or have connections with?
@Retro_Fresh_Tee No, no. But a mans' gotta provide, ya know.
@mattlindner We should talk, my friend. We should talk. How has that writing been going?
@stewrocksthemic I have my reservations in that league, again, but we knew if he made some pitch selection adjustment, he could improve.
I'm looking to make some biz media connections/friends/tweeps. Could use some of your voices in my new life. Anyone feeling merciful?
So, I'm already in the sports media pool. Now I want to swim in the business media pool. How many of my followers are swimming there?
@TheTimWheaton Well, your team just got a whoooole lot worse. =)
He's good. But he's not THAT good.  https://t.co/EtHoDUTmQ6
Finally, all the pitchers I like to anger the internet by criticizing, all in one place!
@LZone Cool. You up for doing a presentation on your offerings to my mgmt team? We'll be here when you're ready.
@wrike They're good stuff. You've got a great program. Thanks for getting back to me.
@wrike Hello, Wrike. Who did your wonderful video ads?
@aub40 Rather give them up when you are close to winning something rather than the off season, with nothing on the line.
@LZone Great chat! Thanks for your time and help! Hopefully more to follow.
@LZone I'd love to chat with you about what Dix and Eaton has to offer and if it's a good fit.
@LZone Basically we're looking for a PR/comm/Ad campaign house to help us post IPO (early next year) build our brand, market, and expertise.
@LZone @LovinTheTribe Awesome. I just contacted your company via the website!
@RobsonLinda for a REAL company. Patriot Software (I was just hired there as the Director of Media Relations).
@creosports Could totally, but he can always go to the pen. Think of how a lack of an experienced lefty hurt the Jays this season.
@RobsonLinda Cool! Thanks. I'm vetting some now and I'm a little under-equipped.You get an A in tweeting.
If they stay competitive and payroll flexible, they can wheel-and-deal into an upgrade mid-season like they did last year.
Also, the signing of Happ (I've not forgotten baseball) is meh, but the offense is so potent, the pitching just has to be dependably average
Get/got any good ideas, tweet me. Or track me down at @PatriotSoftware We're always around.
Okay, so ad scope: It's for https://t.co/CKUT884Ln4, brand building and market growing. Small to start. Measures important. Then we blossom.
@RobsonLinda Woa, You are forbidden to tweet at me. Only people who've never given me a grade may tweet at me.

@DuluthTradingCo My CEO loves your branding style and marketing, made me tweet you to find out who does it? Or if it's all in house. Thanks!
@PatriotSoftware Hey! I know you!
@ZipRecruiter.Hey Zip, was wondering who your marketing and branding style connections were, or if it's all done in house? thanks!
@Grasshopper Hello, Grasshopper. Was wonder, who does your marketing and branding? You are a firm? Can you name them?
Morning! My previous work commute was from my bedroom to my kitchen table at 10am. This 545 wake up with an hour commute thing... is... yah.
@brianpmangan In college, yes. Lots. But in pro ball, nah. You don't really get to build anything. In college, you build tradition.
@JNesbitt10 I have to build a Crisis Plan for the company. Any tips?
The Dodgers probable new manager, Dave Roberts... yeah, I walked him on 5 pitches. Hahaha‚Äîtake that, Roberts: one whole strike!
@JNesbitt10 Yes I am! I just tweeted that link to my Profile. I welcome your connection.
@GregMcIsaac @rob_duffy @reneerouse I will! They're the best!
It takes a digital village of internet savvy, social media connected, good samartweeps to raise an ex-basbeall playing child into a PR man.

@ALLIN4AUSTON When you get to draft extra players in the first round, for years, you get to select the prospects everyone else would.
My thoughts on the AA departure: https://t.co/oGjzwQ6S0e #jays
@MikeCormack Wow. This is how you know today is a dark, dark day, huh? :-)
John Gibbons, you are now on the clock. #Jays
Shapiro may have criticized AA in a vacuum. Different market, different variables. Retooling the farm system will be a major priority. #jays
AA did spend lots of prospects to get Jays where they are. But, Beeston's 5 year contract cap makes wooing FA's in off season tough #jays
@dcanvin Best post season ERA on the team!

Not sure there could have been a more hittable pitch for Donaldson..... to strike out on. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
First Joe Buck talks Price walking into free agency with innings left to play, then a WS graphic showing the Mets - Royals. Stay hot, Fox.
The 7th inning is, apparently, the witching hour for the Blue Jays in Kauffman. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
GIBBONS BETTER START TAPPING HIS ARM IMMEDIATELY.
@mpalm7 @dandakich Damn right! And bought beer for the bus afterwards!
Price's use of the curve is setting up his fastball kill shots well. He's using it more like a change, &amp; smartly stealing early x's with it.
Damn. Ball scorched by Donaldson... right into a mitt. That's a tough break. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
Oh... my... God... Moving runners. Bunting. Have to strike now before that bullpen gets hot.  #Jays #TSN #ALCS
Okay, so, bottom of the order will get a run in, I predict, as THEY usually manufacture. #Jays #TSN #ALCS

I'm not about bean-balling, but David Price *NEEDS* to spin some KC hitters out of the box and get his plate back. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
Hard to make a successful slugging team think situational baseball when they have so many reasons to justify why they shouldn't. #Jays #TSN
Well, good thing the Jays got that lead off double in... Makes that homer by Zobrist hurt less. #ohwait #Jays #ALCS #TSN

Working on a VICE article 'bout Mattingly, the lack of leadership in baseball, its heroin like addiction to metrics, and robot managers.
@therealp25 I didn't say it did. I said i had him swinging and the article offered insight. Correlated but separate positions.
Jose Bautista K'd last night VS Volquez. I had him swinging, even if the pitch wasn't a in zone. Insight here: https://t.co/0dtUm9eqCc
@craigcalcaterra The Marlins. The answer to questions like that is always, The Marlins.
Jose Bautista thinks your tears taste delicious, Derek Holland https://t.co/c1PeDKlMAI
No more Rick and Morty episodes this season... Life's lightbulb just got a little dimmer for me.
The standing ovation Estrada just got must have felt pretty cool. The gratuitous piles of money coming this off season will feel cool, too.
Get Price into tonight. Stroman takes game 6... Line's up Pennington for game 7.
Can't pimp a homer if it's not a homer. #Jays #TSN

Jay's Bullpen is up... 0 outs, first inning. #Jays #TSN
KC up 2-0 in 4 pitches.... #Jays #TSN #ALCS
The Kansas City manufacturing company is already back in action. #Jays #ALCS #TSN
Reynolds blames The Turf.  Bautista blames Goins.  Cueto &amp; Volquez blame The Man in White. I blame... https://t.co/k5TaDb65LL #TSN #JAYS
@yyzsportsmedia Sorry. Probably misunderstood something you tweeted me a while ago.
Not many shimmy-shakes for Johnny Cueto tonight:  2IP, 7 runs, 6 hits, 4BB. #TSN #Jays #ALCS
@MichaelPercy29 Yeah, I work for ESPN, TSN, and VICE. I don't feel cheated.
@cooksville10 Could be. But most likely he's just hiding it from the batter and first base runner who could go on a curve ball...
Seriously, I love that @AROD is doing analysis. One of my favorite players and stories, and he's full of concise and useful information.
Harold Reynolds blames that hit on the turf. Bautista blames that hit on Ryan Goins... #Jays #TSN #ALCS
@LeighMayo @AROD LOL! I do it all the time. A-rod is awesome. One of my favorite players. Seriously.
@LeighMayo @AROD *too* intelligent. But, no, I appreciate a good pun like anyone else.
At least one thing is clear, he's finally found a post season role in which he can perform! #OhSnap.
I'm mesmerized by A-rod as an analyst. Cant decide if I'm watching because of his good analysis, or the off chance he may eat a baby.
Here's my look at what HFA numbers for Jays vs KC. Region locked though‚Äîit's Canadian top secret. http://t.co/n7XgCAMR3m #Jays #TSN #ALCS
@djfriedman24 @KeithOlbermann Nope.
Well, I know what I'm playing tonight, http://t.co/JMpLZ2Zur2
@pantherblood147 @Bobamurf @ShiDavidi I think this has gotten away from its silly-sarcastic and harmless roots. I'm out.
@mike_petriello @based_ball Thanks!
@based_ball I see the depressed slugging home field advantage and am wondering if Jays have HFA respective to KC UZR.
Hey @based_ball anyway we can re-run this http://t.co/xHn8GEQwD7 and see if Jays have a home field advantaged over KC now?
@hockeyesque @ShiDavidi I feel like there is a false correlation taking place here... ;-)
@Bobamurf @ShiDavidi of course; we're more interesting ;-)
@SugarPiies That was the plan.
@ggosnell @businesshoursjp @ShiDavidi That's the point of making funny of cliche' - you play into it.
@hockeyesque @ShiDavidi You sure about that? ;-) http://t.co/7YFaJAxl5J
One day, when we all drive our sled dogs to the gun store, united as one people. One fine day #Cometogether @businesshoursjp @ShiDavidi
@ShiDavidi Canadians talking about Americans... also pretty funny.
@Mitch99Williams I think he'll be great, and I'm pretty confident he'll be less polarizing in the booth than he is on the field.
@Mitch99Williams Of course it's comical; my entire career is a joke‚Äîbut I've found a way to make a living off the punchline. ;-)
@craigcalcaterra strategic plan to make Reynolds sound more likeable?
Hey @Mitch99Williams what do you think about A-rod doing #ALCS coverage? insightful or frightful?
@Mitch99Williams easy old man, at your age your heart is as unpredictable as your fastball command.
@JsXtm @Mitch99Williams Soft opening for now, but that's the plan
Baseball great @Mitch99Williams and I collide to bring you an old vs new school baseball podcast. Soft opening here: https://t.co/weKSm8rc73
@vftb I don't do the uploading, sadly. I'll let my producer know.
@gojones71 he actually brings that up in the podcast. But we're friends.
@gojones71  Starting with the Soundcloud soft opening to gauge appeal. This is a joint venture with VICE. More to come, I'm sure.
@TroysRun @Mitch99Williams  soft opening to gauge appeal. This is a joint venture with VICE. More to come, I'm sure.
@vftb Starting with the Soundcloud soft opening to gauge appeal. This is a joint venture with VICE. More to come, I'm sure.

@Mitch99Williams Listen to me argue with Wild Thing on our Wild Pitch podcast. https://t.co/R05z7yJ3TM
Don't worry, Bautista gets punched out on that. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
Drip, drip, drip... BABIP'd to death. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
Some one get David Price's post season narrative a live chicken... #TSN #JAYS #ALCS
Zone hasn't changed. Always been low. But the low and inside kill pitch hasn't been there and probably won't be there against a catcher....
Not sure Price should still be in this game. #Jays #TSN #ALCS
Royals doing what they do. Slap, Slash, Slap, Slash. They're a manufacturing company in a baseball team's body. #ALCS #JAYS #TSN
#ALDS
I got it! I got it! I got it! You got! #Jays #ALDS #TSN
@michael_schlact Clearly you don't understand outfielder fashion and accessorizing.
Tulohthankgod.
@ShiDavidi I wasn't at the game?
What.  Are.  You.  Watching, Tulo?  #Jays #TSN
Jose just #powned some Royals fans with a fake ball toss. #Jays #TSN. He will bat flip the world.
Alex Rios is 75% legs.
Jose's not mad. He always looks like that. #scowl #Jays
Volquez isn't ready, Harold... just admit you can't count past 5.
@stevemaich Donaldson's pretty good, Steve. Sleep on it, maybe?
@frang4u Not on the roster.
Chin music is Volquez's favorite tune. At least against the Jays. Here is why: http://t.co/GY2aNVq5G8
@streak1991 The Blue Jays are almost unanimously pick to win the World Series by several analysts across many media companies
@craigcalcaterra see you there
If ever there was a time for a bat flip, it was Bautista's last night. Flip em' all, Jose. You've never hit a bigger home run in your life.
I'm about to join CTV's Canada AM to talk Jays. Tune in, if you're awake. #Jays
@Keip666666 The true story of baseball's origin is in England, where it was called Rounders and Cricket. Lets not lose our minds, here.
@Keip666666 Sure.
Banister's comments on he off-the-bat rule play, "we keep our heads up and stay focused" - 'cept for that inning where team made 3 errors...
@mirtle @Bryguy78 Can't blame Jays fans: team was an offensive juggernaut. But Texas upgraded, got hot, and had all the tools to go far.
@Nick_C_C Great at the time. Who knew he'd become this.
@mirtle Thanks. Two good teams. One great result.
CONGRATULATIONS BLUE JAYS! WHAT A COMEBACK! #TSN #JAYS #ALCS!
@DCLORDS Doesn't matter. Rule trumps the incorrect call. We're done here.
Home run by Bautista = a stake in the heart of the Rangers. They had this series locked up, now they are on life support. #Jays #TSN
You will be talking about this game 22 years from now, Canada. And that conversation will end with THAT swing by Bautista. #Jays #TSN
My god... This #Jays #Rangers game is nuts. #TSN
Pretty sure the recipe for losing in the post season starts with 3 straight errors... #Jays #TSN
However, if I have to make a judgment here, the call.... appears correct, and will probably stand. #Jays #TSN More when we know it.
Time/Dead called after the ball was already off Choo's bat. Play is in motion. And, did the ump apply it correctly? So much unclear. #TSN
Please, TO fans, stop throwing stuff on field! #Jays #TSN
No intent by Choo to obstruct the return throw, therefore it seems the ball is live and this run‚Äîas absolutely insane as it is‚Äîcounts. #TSN
clearly this rule can only be decided by manager vs manager battle to the death... #TSN #Jays
Un.  Frickin'.  Believable.  #Jays #ALDS #TSN
EDWING!!!! #Jays #ALDS #TSN!
When going in on @JoeyBats19, you have to get it IN. He loves mistakes on the inner half. #Doubles #Dingers #jays #TSN
Yeah, I realize he got a low call in his favor, but he lost a high call. It all evens out, you just don't get to choose when... #Jays #TSN
Cole Hamels executes.  That is all.
#Sinker = K #jays #TSN
Rangers up 1-0. #Jays Damn, that was quick.
HAR-OLD-REY-NOLDS! *clap* *clap* *clap-clap-clap* #Jays #TSN HAR-OLD-REY-NOLDS! *clap* *clap* *clap-clap-clap*  -- Make it happen!!!
@likelys Already did Estrada's Change up.
@Baseball123Bats TSN has to do that for me. I don't control the content access.
Here is a non geo-locked version of my explanation of how a sinking fastball works, and how to hide it. http://t.co/FRsdl9zWEE #TSN #Jays
@NukeLalooch @TSN1050Radio thanks!
@HypnotistDave @BtBScore blog sites make errors. I've made errors. It happens. I can't read all of everything generated each day.
@HypnotistDave @BtBScore I haven't read it, but their stuff is usually solid.
@jessespector then we're finally intellectual equals!
@jessespector we should grab a poutine, talk about why Canadian youth can't catch, and how Rogers Centre turf/lights make it death trap.
@jessespector got you passport?
Expressed my sentiments exactly! "@robneyer: My guesses for why @RADickey43 didn't get a W, but @DAVIDprice14 did: http://t.co/groxSML7Xw‚Ä¶"
@mikemac2112 Yes
@astles9 price
@33Wakefield yep. And I was wrong.
Important thing now is, Jays have a game 5 and, if they win it, Dickey has a chance to get pulled early in the championship series, too ;-)
I'm all for team W's, and it's a shame this "safe over sorry" move came when it did, but I had confidence Dickey makes it through 5.
He wasn't struggling and had been just as, if not more effective than Price vs the Rangers. Now he's burnt for game 5, according to Jays.
Glad Jays won, and not saying Dickey should put his stats above the team, but not convinced Price was needed or necessary to finish the 5th.
... Gonna be a looooooong time before they get Hayhurst up... but I'm available if needed. #Jays
... Then Hutch, then Kawasaki, then Jamie Campbell... #Jays
Gibby is just trolling Twitter right now. After Stroman, I'm pretty sure he'll get Mark Buehrle up as well. #Jays #TSN
Honestly, if I'm Dickey, I'm pissed. Needed one out to get a post season W &amp; up by 6. He can't say that, of course, but damn... #TSN #Jays.
Truly, it all makes "sense" in that a day of rest can have Estrada &amp; Price back and available. But Dickey out right there... curious. #TSN
Pardon me. On his own #Wednesday. No, don't think so. Day off goes a long way if Price used correctly. Hopefully just 6-8 batters tops.
@streak1991 @RGriffinStar Runner on 2nd AND Beltre' is 4 feet off the bag...
Jays saved up all their offense from the first two games for today. Lead 7-0 in the 3rd. #Jays #TSN Jays bats are barreling everything.
Price up in the first while Jays have 2 outs. That's what a SUPER short leash looks like, but Dickey escapes to pitch another inning. #TSN
Holy Rasmus for Vice President! #ALDS
Holy Correa for president! #ALDS
A little insight into the Knuckle Ball and what RA DIckey needs to do today against the Rangers: http://t.co/CFr8vFH2P2 #TSN #Jays
Word has it Harold Reynolds will be apologizing today for his comments yesterday, and he's even offered to do it in Canadian. #Tsn #jays
I argued that he had all the mechanical grace of an exorcism and that most of what made him healthy was luck 'cuz it sure wasn't form.
Just met AND argued with Mitch Williams about pitching mechanics. He (of course) thinks players break now because they don't throw enough.
@jimfurlong4 ?
God I hate that song... @TSN1040
Joining @TSN1040 now to talk #jays, Price, and, the most popular topic of this 2015 MLB post season, Harold Reynolds.
@SteveTSN @SportsCentre Thanks!
It's about time. #Jays #TSN
"This guy, I can't remember his name right now, has been crucial for the Rangers bullpen." ‚Äî Harold Reynolds.
There is a reason that Utley slide "looks" dirty, Harold. It WAS dirty. #Jays #TSN
@charlesadler @joe_warmington @sladurantaye @kinsellawarren Meh, we'd give it to you.
I mean, how on earth does Russell Martin catch all those baseballs? #Jays #TSN
Wonder if Reynolds can catch a puck? Wonder how many Canadians would like to see him try right now? #Jays #TSN
Reynolds commentary about how Canadians don't grow up playing baseball so they aren't used to catching things... *face palm* #Jays #TSN
@jeffhysen @TBSNetwork sorry! I'd happily be.
@LFBrewery I'm in!
@stephenwmartin Didn't feel like it yesterday, huh? http://t.co/BViLAJublS has a good tool to measure umps' missed calls. Check there.
I'll be in Canada on Canadian Thanksgiving. No place to celebrate it, though... Any suggestions? #Jays #TSN
I mean, have you see the THE SIZE of some of those vacuums....
To be fair, most of those vacuums were juicing. No testing in the 1950's. @JATayler @hangingsliders
The supremely talent @Kara_Wagland and I made some damn good @SportsCentre today. #tsn
Stroman settling down, getting his two-seam to sink instead of flat &amp; drifting. Backing off its velo. Sometimes less is more #TSN #Jays
Martin should keep putting down the "have them hit it to Colabello" finger. #TSN #Jays
Mission Impossible 6: Concussion Protocol. #Jays #TSN
Errors are the story of the game today, on the field and in the broadcast booth ;-) #Jays #TSN I blame the turf‚Äîalways the turf.
*Beltre' shakes head in disappointment* #TSN #Jays
"Nothing stinky about his play... " Costas, I have higher expectation for you...
Great heads up baseball by Odor reading the out of position Jays infielders. #TSN #Jays
Donaldson's head = feeling better. #TSN
Oh, Costas, your dulcet tones are welcome here in Canada. Speaking of Canada, thank you for revoking Harold Renoylds' worker permit. #TSN
For my Canadian region followers, here is my TSN breakdown and win prediction on Stroman VS Hamels http://t.co/JeeUPkExF3 #TSN #ALDS
@JonHeymanCBS Did they mention my name? I'm available.
Stroman 1-0 career vs TEX, 0.00 ERA. Hamels 0-2 in 4 career starts vs TOR 6.97 ERA. #Jays #TSN #ALDS2015
Low lights... turf... To Reynolds, The Rogers Centre is a death trap. #Jays #TSN
Both 3rd Basemen are out of Jays/Rangers game. Donaldson down and out... #Jays #TSN
Jays making the adjustment, going opposite field on Gallardo's consistent down-and-away approach. Bottom of order better suited for that.
I think we get the point that Harold Reynolds does not like turf. #Jays
Rangers lose Beltre. Out of the game. Serious blow for their offensive production. All eyes on Gallardo now for a shut down inning.
So far, the astroturf is the Jays' best player.
Join me and @NabilKarimTSN on TSN 2 post #Jays game for complete game break down and analysis @TSN !!!
Arrieta could throw a ball over the backstop and it would get called a strike right now.
@SimonDingleyCBC thanks, Simon!
Dude, @ChrisArcher42 is killing it. Solid analysis. Great insights. My hero.
@rcamcole Nope. I'm watching the real game!
Watch Tanaka K10+ and Keuchel go 5 innings. For all the hubbub about Keuchel, it's going to come down to bullpens. That's my prediction.
Watching the Astro's/Yankee's game from TSN mother ship in Toronto. In a vacuum, Houston has a clear edge, but Yankee's are going to grind.
I loved seeing Chris @ChrisArcher42 on ESPN tonight. He's a natural. And he's one step closer to playing Jaden Smith's twin in a movie.
@Shokdiesel Or Dirk HAYHURSTs... ;-)
7 years ago today my amazing wife; the love of my life, @GroovyGarfoose were married. Happy #7, dear, you are my all. üíûüíûüíçüíûüíû
On one hand I feel bad for Buehrle. On the other, his absence from the play off roster just got that much easier to rationalize.
Packing up for my trip to Canada. I be there, on TSN television and radio, covering the #Jays until they win it all or die trying.
@YakyuNightOwl @jorgearangure @VocalMinoritySD shucks
@lundinbridge I dont nec. like Norris' comments. I think they were very consistent of a mentality I've seen too much of in my playing days.
@lundinbridge Says the featured columnist for bleacher report ;-)
