We were diverted to Canada for 2 weeks
Some of the crew took the plane tho. My prayers go out to their families
It was so surreal. Thank God for the tour bus.
Next thing we kno, the plane that we were suppose to be on was on the news.
I chose the bus bc I wanted to play my video games (lol)....
I was in Boston on tour with the Backstreet Boys. We had a choice of riding the tour bus or flying to the next city.
I was suppose to be on the flight that hit the Towers
Y'all r gonna trip when I tell u my 9/11 story
Where were u on 9/11/01?
My prayers go out to the families, friends, and victims of the 9/11.
