@CR93306942 How sad for the parents of the Parkland students who were killed to have to listen to someone bring up The Wall at hearing about gun violence. A wall does not equal gun safety. That's the point I was making.
@AdamWisconsin @DarthMelissa No worries. It was all there in the post. I was just commenting on it as, this was over three years ago when the force awakens was going to be coming out.
@AdamWisconsin @DarthMelissa Never said it shouldn't have been made. Maybe the past 3 1/2 years made you think that. I was bummed that it was only Leia toy in the star wars row, "in the boy section" of the store. And my 4 year old daughter was disappointed that was the only Leia toy they had
@AdamWisconsin @DarthMelissa Why would I be offended by that?
@NHLhistorygirl @mikecommito That's when Tik ended up a ranger?! Wow
@mikecommito @NHLhistorygirl Just a nickname my we gave him. I thought it fit his playing style perfectly.
Also, didn't remember that when Johnny Huff &amp; Puff was traded from the Isles to the Flames, that the teams played later that day.  Hey @mikecommito, @NHLhistorygirl any other trades go down like that?
It‚Äôs 9:25am, here is what I‚Äôve learned so far today: John Tonelli signed with the @lakings BEFORE Gretzky was traded, he finished his career with Quebec, and despite what we called him in our house, his nickname was NOT "Johnny Huff &amp; Puff"

@ReidLJ I totally understand how angry he was. I would be too. But I would demand an investigation. Something he did not do. He's getting one now though. We will see what happens.
@Am0ebaa @JasonWestRayner @DeborahAKizziah @michaelrosenbum we lost David Nutter as a director cause he went off to direct the Smallville pilot (as well as countless other pilots that became big shows) As for the cancellation, can't say. Alex had already been killed off

@Libertarian310 Hey man, I'm trying to make sense of this messy, personal, political nightmare just like everyone else.
@TheRightDuff Damnit Colin! Read before pressing send!
@kerlickTexas If I had the truth on my side? Absolutely.
@Libertarian310 You're right. That's unreasonable. You would think that a person would adamantly DEMAND an investigation to clear his name. But that's not he's calling for is he? Instead he just bitterly complains how unfair this all is.
@PFTompkins @bryan_onymous @nanglish Go. On!!!!
Simple put, the way #Kavenaugh handled himself today he shouldn't even reside over the Peoples Court much less The Supreme Court of The Unites States.

@MPiccolo99 @Viqueen44 So, if he's been wrongly advised, let's take the time to right this falsehood. Right? Or should we just "plow right thru"? It's only lifetime position after all.
@MeechonMeech So that dead senator also did horrible things...is that what you're saying? What's your point? Cause I may wrong but I don't believe Teddy is up for the Supreme Court at the moment.

There is a scene in The Duece between Maggie Gyllenhaal and @methodman that I still think about months after I first saw it. The two of them are amazing together but there is just something about Meth's performance that floors me.

Really cannot begin to stress how smart, enlightening, and insanely funny "The Good Place" is. Everything about it from the Writing, performances and plots twists are a damn delight. Cannot wait for the third season.

Not familiar with these Club or dub remixes? https://t.co/2eI8K5RLdf
@1UrbanEarring @darinhenderson Dont deny that but those concept albums are very different from Joshua tree. Only one of the first three on dark side is a structured song
@toddweberguitar True
@luke3vans Don't think it counts when you didn't write the third song
@toddweberguitar And you got the same problem on that third song... Not one of the greatest hits
@CheeseDog2015 Said the same thing
@1UrbanEarring Was wondering about these. Not quite the same. Feel like these are a totally different beast
@toddweberguitar I'd argue that third track wouldn't make a greatest hits album
Long story short, too late, those first three songs play like they're the first three of a greatest hits album. That's insanely rare
I'd argue that this one seems to almost come closer than some of the others. https://t.co/MurzKRSDCa
