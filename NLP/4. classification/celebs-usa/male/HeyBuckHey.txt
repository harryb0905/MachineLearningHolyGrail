Spider-Man Into the Spidey-Vers was the best picture of the year. #OSCARS https://t.co/2juB4l503J
I really did not love Bohemian Rhapsody. I thought it was a fine movie but I am shocked by any acclaim. But to be just an average movie with a great lead performance.  #OSCARS
@PattiMurin I know you love him. Haha 🤗❤️
Let’s be honest. Black women give the very best speeches. Always. #Oscars https://t.co/pbFFvyvCAa
Chris Evans has on more makeup than Jennifer Lopez. I ain’t mad. #OSCARS

I love when people change their Grindr photos and I don’t realize I’ve spoken to them many times prior. We get to have awkward conversations all over again. Sup? 😈
@OtotheBeirne True. And I shouldn’t comment on warmth but it’s subjective sport so I’m subjective. Haha I’d be pissed for 9.925 too. 🙏
@hharden85 @OtotheBeirne @GymCastic I’d be most qualified to talk in great detail about the 1988 to 1996 Olympics. Haha. 🥳
I did that with Ally McBeal once. https://t.co/wBqN35c6kC
@OtotheBeirne I died.
@OtotheBeirne Also agree. 😍
@ChalkItUpBlog I love her outfit today. So chic!
@OtotheBeirne I love that too!!!
The only thing about Women’s Collegiate Gymnastics that drives me crazy is those silly beam dismounts. And some of the scoring.  But mostly those simple circa 1970 dismounts. 🤪 #NCAAGym

@austmcdermott @megs2ugb @MSkinner2016 @GymCastic Legs apart on pre flight and toes pretty flat in the air. It’s a beautiful landing but not necessarily a beautiful vault. But I understand her frustration in scoring in general. But there are plenty of form breaks in the vault to warrant a deduction.
I scored a goal in ⚽️ tonight. I just felt the need to document all my athleticism. Thank you.

The best part of this video is that I say I have no opinion and then have many opinions! HA!
Jussie Smollett is apparently lying about his attack. I’ve been cringe following the whole thing and not wanting to chime in until now. Here are my thoughts. https://t.co/5BnImBI7c8  Thanks for watching. ❤️ https://t.co/3CyYqsvECP

@koreykuhl I thought of you! LOL I struggled with it but appreciate the sentiment! LOL
I am sure it was a tribute to Dolly but it was odd as she looked like KATY PERRY BEFORE! And she really UNDER sang and then Katy Perry went and OVER sang so it was just visually and vocally odd. #GRAMMYs https://t.co/nuosgoCLil
Has Kacey Musgraves joined the some vocal protection program? Was that wig meant as a tribute to Dolly or was she hoping no one would recognize her? #GRAMMYs 🙈🙉

The key to enjoying a made for TV musical is to to just watch it as it’s own unique experience. It’s not a Broadway show. Not a motion picture. It’s it’s own thing. So I’m watching it clean brained as possible. 💁🤪🙏 #Rent
Without You is as lovely as always. That song and scene truly stand up and would be moving in any production. Lovely. #Rent

@annmjensen 🤪🤪🤪🤪
@BarbaraStans @JonathanBeyer81 Such an iconic moment.  She did later clarify before the 93 pro am and then skated even worse. A dark period. And yet Tonya’s thugs thought they had to take that out!? https://t.co/ahMa4DzbKF
@lenatheplug @VIXEN Ps you look phenomenal. ❤️
@lenatheplug I’ll take one. ❤️💕
@JonathanBeyer81 I just want to die. Oh my god. 🤣🤪

@nytimes holy crap!
@rockerskating I love you! Thank you for your coverage!
@BarbaraStans @AshWagner2010 She is super impressive as a commentator! Her voice is very pleasing as well!
@AshWagner2010 "those are my tricks" landing on two feet. 🤣🤣🤣
@rockerskating elegant. simple. sophisticated.  available at Macy's this fall.
@lurkingkingof I always thought she was acting or being funny to be a good tv persona but nope. Haha
Every time I think she can't be as horrible as she seems, she finds a new way to be horrible. Plain and simple. https://t.co/1zp7WaPzoI
I enjoyed #USChamps19 last night! I really thought the ladies looked great! I cried when Alysa Liu cried! TWO TRIPLE AXELS! 🙏 Tennell and Bell are much improved overall. I really liked Cui and Harrell. And then I made the gays watch @MichelleWKwan skate to Fields of Gold.

And honestly I think a lot of you saw the made for TV movie with Mark Harmon playing Ted Bundy and thought Bundy was better looking than he actually was. 💅 https://t.co/Z3GtxkKfbG
I watched the #TedBundyTapes in one sitting. It was fine. There was nothing new really. It remains shocking he had escaped from jail for all those days.  Also how nuts he was at the trial and generally unwell he seemed yet people were still taken by his “charm”.
@realDonaldTrump morning sunshine. 🥳
@JonathanBeyer81 @kwanette You are ❤️
@capecodenver Haha. It’s good. I know this whole story though so it’s very familiar. 🙈
@NickMcCarvel Totally. She looked like a different skater tonight. ❤️❤️❤️
Watching #TedBundyTapes before bed. I didn’t want to sleep tonight anyways. 🙈🙈🙈
@USFigureSkating @bradie_tennell @MariahSk8rBell @AmberGlenn_ Loved it. You all skated great. ❤️
Loved watching the pairs. I know all the top teams so was super excited to watch and cheer. #USChamps19
@LoisElfman OH! I WOULD HAVE! HAHA!
Watching #USChamps19. One pair skated to Bette Midler. Next pair skated to Barbra Streisand. Thank you for giving the gays what we want. ❤️🙌🌈
@mirai_nagasu doing a great job on the Ice Desk!! @USFigureSkating!  Great job @NickMcCarvel ❤️
@Pup_Amp and i love YOU!

If I am going to be a YouTuber again, I really need to maybe look in a mirror before I start filming. I am shocked how zero regard I seem to have for my appearance before I hit record. https://t.co/OivR9FXQSU
I read the book "The Stranger Beside Me" multiple times as a teenager. I watched the movie. I would go to the library and read anything I could about Ted Bundy.  I am both excited and terrified to sit down and watch this. https://t.co/gcmzECWEw0

Gays. People who didn't see The Wife, I saw A Star is Born 4 times. I love Gaga. I adore her performance. I would never come on twitter &amp; say Gaga was robbed. It might get your RT's &amp; it's an easy opinion to have. But - again - YOU DIDN'T SEE THE WIFE. IT IS GLENN CLOSE! https://t.co/BC0u8xyKrn

@ChrisCrocker they were MAD and the same people who were happy Kelly joined a cult and got shot. When Luke and Jenny made out in the pool that scene, I could have masturbated, it was so hot.
@ChrisCrocker Picture it! Me at the school basketball game - winter of 1992. I was a senior - just like Kelly and the gang. I showed up with a sign of what was HOT and what was NOT. Kelly was on the Hot side. Brenda was on the not side. I was spreading this truth in real time!
@ChrisCrocker I love you! Can we talk about this all the time?
I’m like who is that bearded dreamboat who just scored two soccer goals? Oh. It’s me bitch. 😂⚽️🥇 https://t.co/iYy5jh9U6i

@Lafond66 Sorry. Just DM me next time.

@Cyn190 I totally get it! XO
@Cyn190 No one would disagree with you. This was proven in a court of law. He is dead. He has taken his own life. You are allowed to be judgmental of him. You are allowed to be compassionate of him. It has nothing to do with his actions but rather the type of person YOU wish to be. xo
@nymphacissa I handled it fine thank you. I handle all news fine. :-) xo
I cannot imagine what planet you live on where you would wish a human being to burn in hell. I will pray for you as well unless you are so perfect you have never done anything wrong? I will at least pray you know the difference between piece and "peace". Love &amp; Compassion, Buck https://t.co/Gn2uEMyR0R

@mametown we went around the table at dinner last night and my 10 year old nephew made us name our favorite YouTuber. The children all named people I do not know. I said "The person who uploads bootleg episodes of Designing Women, the person who uploads 1980's gymnastics and Mametown". 😍
@Simone_Biles thank you for the re-tweet and for being magnificent you!
@jpmetz you got this! allow the urge but do not eat it. LOL Honor the commitment you made to yourself. XO
@derekeb OMG! HA!
The "Fierce Five" &amp; The "Final Five gymnastics nicknames have taken on a more powerful meaning today. 2012 are indeed Fierce and brave survivors. 2016 is indeed the Final group to have to suffer through all of this abuse. Let's all go and do "magnificent things in the world".

@FeliciaRicci Yes! HAHA! Many years ago! :-) But we will properly meet one of these years! :-)
@FeliciaRicci I saw you in something at Yale......might have been A Little Night Music? Side Show? Something!?  And then I saw you on the train and made small talk with you as you were going in for an audition. I think I am not making this up but I might be! HA!
@booshoe37 @meekakitty @JesseCale I DROVE RIGHT THROUGH THERE!
@FeliciaRicci wait! I think i did meet you once on the train to New York from New Haven. I might be making this up.

We tell kids "not everyone is going to like you".  We should tell them "not everyone is SUPPOSED to like you".  That one word can really shift a lifetime of trying to "get" people to like you which never works. BOOM!

Typo. Haha *of not or. 😉😉😆😆😆
And make sure they are believable.  You can't go from I hate myself to I love myself. Your brain will not buy such a leap of self talk. So make your affirmations believable or use bridge thoughts. "I am open to the idea or loving myself.". 😍😍😍 https://t.co/LmdafCkDLa

@WillGravesAP @MagsGotSwag12 right! If anyone was going to be "A" it had to be Maggie! &lt;3
HERE IS THE LATEST LIVESTREAM! https://t.co/qs5hOe2bSM Someone struggles with "Why Wasn't It Me" and I explain there are WAY BETTER QUESTIONS to ask yourself instead. Hope you take a listen!  Happy Tuesday! May it be as magical as your greatest weekend ever! Why not? Come On!
@MagsGotSwag12 we hear you. we support you. we love you. thank you for being so brave!!!!!
Wow. Maggie was gymnast "A". She is the one who got the ball rolling against Nassar. She is an amazing young woman. Thank you for being so brave! https://t.co/hPxuW35Mzb
@Advil same!
Forgiveness is never about the other person. We forgive others for OURSELF. You also do not have to "forget".  You simply have to stop giving away your emotional power to other people. "Problem" solved. ;-) xo https://t.co/VA5J7LFGal
NEW VIDEO! I commented on the #GoldenGlobes and the #USChamps18! Because I know you wanted me too! Yay!  https://t.co/wkD1Q4Vwuy Thanks for watching!

@Pup_Amp Haha!!!
I love when people mention things they want in their online profiles and they list "hygiene". 🤣🤣🤣  I also love when people list themselves as "sane" or say "don't be crazy". https://t.co/UsI6MCRLSy
@Adaripp @rossminer Agree!!!!! So nice. Such an awesome guy and skater.
I just woke my dog up to kiss him. I asked him how I got so lucky to have such a wonderful companion in life.  He didn't answer. But still.   I felt compelled to tell him I love him.
@thatgirlonline Agree!
Get Out was a comedy/musical? #GoldenGlobes https://t.co/hG9L8GHQj1

Oh an I just uploaded a new video on @YouTube! Go watch it if you want to see someone living their best most contributing to the world life!  https://t.co/WPU6wRz5aY And yes since you asked about LP, I said something....
How dare you all think Logan Paul or some algorithm has "ruined" YouTube. This must feel very disempowering.  I suggest you do some internal work on this and stop looking for external solutions to your "problems". Love you!
@a_rae_rizzi you are kind!
When you argue with reality, you lose every time.
The "good old days"is such a silly/non helpful place to spend your time. Live in the present. I promise you are missing out on a wonderful world and a wonderful YouTube if you are stuck living in the past.  Create your amazing experience! Thank you and Good Night! https://t.co/aKzKD23SeY
@BarbaraStans @USFigureSkating GOTCHA!

@therobnfw oh hi!
I am going to film a Q &amp; A! Right now!  Tweet me as many questions as you want! Anything! Go!
Oh you know sobbing reading a Facebook update how someone's companion dog died and how beautifully she served the owner.  I love Facebook.

Did you see my video about my tattoo with two mistakes on it?  I think I handled it pretty well! ;-)  https://t.co/smJ3fQTN9F https://t.co/rehDXFPT1q
@nishatnguyen @hankgreen CUTE! BIG HAIR DON'T CARE!
@Holobrine @Quasica @hankgreen You never ever have to explain more. You never explain or defend yourself. You show up in the world and you allow others to think what they like about you. Always. Period.
@JackHoward @hankgreen It is a really good one! Keep it handy on a post it! ;-)  It is life/game changing. I walk away from all interactions so peaceful.
@hankgreen Thanks Hank! Takes a bit to get used to that but it is so powerful. I think of all the times we try to convince someone that we are something different than what they think. They will think what the want about us REGARDLESS of us. xx
One more! HA! https://t.co/AEFcoBqPKp
@JennineMatthias and when you do it - separate out the facts from the thought drama and notice what you is s a fact and what is just a thought. After you do that write some intentional thoughts that you would like to choose to think :-) Have fun!
@JennineMatthias Love that - I do that every day! It is a thought download to clear your mind!  AMAZING!!
@dianeyounge @michaelaranda I am your mom! ;-)
@LinzDeFranco @Twitter @TwitterSupport Haha! My friend who is verified did change his and it stayed verified
@jacksfilms I didn't realize how badly I needed this apology.  You are the only reason there is still a You in YouTube. Bless your content.
@BrizzyVoices @itsamemarion @getinkbox oh i love it!!!
Anyone I know work at @Twitter who can help me change my twitter handle and not lose my verification? Thanks! Cc @TwitterSupport
@StephanieGould @ITonyaMovie Oh I recall. Haha!!!!
@StephanieGould @ITonyaMovie im going next week! DYING!!
@michaelaranda I am having an amazing 2018. AND just got 5 new pairs of underwear in the mail! Fun! Focus on creating an amazing year for yourself regardless of the circumstances you listed! Yay! xx
@9NEWS I live in Denver now. Do you need me to come down and report on Olympics? ;-)
This week I will tweet about nationals from my long forgotten second account set up to tweet such ramblings! HAHA! Ladies short tonight! BOOM! https://t.co/DLyv943lGj
@JaclynGlenn @AceNichols33 Isn't it amazing??? Existing is enough!
THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF RESILIENCE. You do not get confidence from accomplishments, You gain confidence because of obstacles &amp; setbacks you overcome. This is all internal work she has done on herself that will set her up beautifully for nationals &amp; the rest of her life! https://t.co/mtM2Sg39tk
@KalelKitten I totally get the need to vent! HAHA!! Miss you too! HUGS!!!
@KalelKitten In 2011 I had 1 million subscribers and could get anywhere around 10k to 100k views. This is not new. :-)
@KalelKitten I am laughing because i also remember emailing Lisa Nova and asking her to pose for titty thumbs for me! HILARIOUS AND TRAGIC TO TYPE!!  OMG!! HAHAHHAHHA!
@KalelKitten I feel your pain! But YouTubers thinking YouTube owes them anything is not helpful for the platform or the creators moving forward. YouTube has always done EXACTLY what YouTube wanted to do. It is a website. We as human beings just need to focus on what WE can do :-) Onward!
@TheView @blackishabc @grownish @YaraShahidi THIS YOUNG WOMAN WAS A DELIGHT!! SO SMART!!! SO WELL SPOKEN! I was dumbfounded when @MeghanMcCain pointed out she was 17!!!
@DeniseVlogs ROFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!  crying!!!!
@booshoe37 @JamieTLD @TeamYouTube OMG MATTHEW!!! HAHA!
I mean. Many of us were using "titty" thumbs in 2007-2010. That was screaming pretty loud. I think YouTube was always like this but yes "only a matter of time" before the titty thumbs became a dead body. Do not be sad about YouTube. You focus on creating amazing content! Hugs! &lt;3 https://t.co/o4SRJExjIb
NEW VIDEO! I got a tattoo and it has TWO TYPOS!!!! TWO! (2)!!!! https://t.co/smJ3fQTN9F Did I mention it has not one but TWO typos???????
HAHA!! I love that you tweeted this you bitch. She looks great! You go girl! You work that new face! LOL
You are asking us to comment on a woman's face following a accident? Does this seem like not a great use of air time in 2018? LOL Asking for a friend. https://t.co/alC5bqIarJ
I think the world has chimed in enough about him. I talked a bit about it on my last @YouNow - more so the reaction rather than the actual video he made.  It is nice to not feel compelled to offer my opinion on such things on twitter or the youtube dot com. HAHA! Hugs! https://t.co/W5b4J1YMeK
Yay and thank you Sabrina!!  https://t.co/DXbZZXDfR9
@JeremyJahns HAHA! Yeah I have zero interest on chiming in! HAHA! The world has said enough.

@FreddyAmazin this is beautiful.
This is one of the most powerful tools you can use. People spend so many energy "defending" themselves to others or wanting to "prove" somehow they are not what someone else thinks. Pointless. Time/Energy suck. LET PEOPLE BE WRONG ABOUT YOU. (write this down) https://t.co/rUDhwgq9S3

@amycat728 no i wrote to all the top fans! HA!
@chrissyteigen @ijustine "honestly my fault for even trying to hold conversation on a platform not meant for it." Twitter in a nutshell! Even with 240 characters! You are both lovely. :-) https://t.co/6kK1RweI9m
@bryanlanning exactly. ;-)
@jamescharles I promise you do not need to engage in this conversation. Let people be wrong about you. They will think whatever they like REGARDLESS of what you tweet. Hugs!
Your mind is the only thing that can overcome obstacles and your mind is what makes something an obstacle. Life is much easier once you realize this truth.
@MusicalMash HAHA! https://t.co/i9nmoJxVAw
@ChrisCrocker my timeline is amazing and lovely! HAHA! Happy New Year!
@KEEMSTAR @LoganPaul I saw so many 10 year old kids with Logan Paul shirts on tonight. It is weird they told me they love him but they think he is an idiot.

@Strawburry17 ps - do this with any thoughts you have an no longer want as well ;-) xx
@Strawburry17 Throw all your clothes on the floor in a pile - look at each item - touch it and ask yourself: IS IT SERVING YOU? DO YOU WANT IT? IS IT OUTDATED? Keep only the clothes you wear often and bring you joy and thank the items that you once loved and no longer need and donate them.
@thescranline I love not looking much! I look at a few replies but i don't get my news here anymore!
@helenmarie95 @JeremyJahns He reminds me of me! but funny and handsome! ;-)
