5) yet because my assessment of POTUS doesn‚Äôt fit the leftist and Anti-Trump narrative, my first hand (and willing on the record) information never makes it into those hit pieces.  Sad state of affairs in American J.  ETB
4) The President was in a perfectly matter of fact mood. Demeanor was the same as it has been with me in numerous other one-on-one meetings (not on-air interviews).  He spoke and listened.  I saw zero evidence of the hot tempered CIC portrayed in so many articles lately...
3) I just sat down with @realDonaldTrump for 30 minutes in the Oval and spent more time with he and @flotus at an event the next evening. He was engaged in the news of the day: Wall funding, Govt shutdown and an upcoming D majority in the house.  He was....

Question:  If the caravan is filled with people seeking asylum *why isn‚Äôt Mexico providing that? (Clearly the best solution to this ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù crisis).  Answer:  Because its likely not really about political asylum, it‚Äôs about migration to the US. Illegally, I might add.

Wrong- Alex Jones and I agreed to interview each other. You may have missed that.. in fact, I clarified that in the first two minutes. https://t.co/se5lQagXgq
I‚Äôve done many thousands of hours of television.. I can say that my Alex Jones hour was one of the most volatile I‚Äôve ever hosted. We were two men (who disagree on just about everything) clashing.  Yet finding common ground on one topic-&gt;  Free speech. üá∫üá∏ AMericA üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/F7e0K4mCBF

I want to thank you all who came out and offered words of support after that awful person tweeted something incredibly brutal about my son Eric Chase. The silver lining is the love I feel from all of you.  It far exceeds the massive amount of hate she delivered in a 7 word tweet.

Exactly what I‚Äôve been preaching!  @nytimes  ‚Ä¢ Mr. Trump‚Äôs threat to impose tariffs has sent other leaders scrambling. The European Union made a significant concession on Thursday, saying it would cut its existing penalties on automobiles to zero, provided the U.S. did the same.
Watch! Last week while debating MX Pres Vincente Fox I predicted Mexico WILL agree to renegotiate NAFTA. And Canada would come to the table soon after. This week Mexico agreed to a renegotiated NAFTA and today Canada is expected to come to the table.  #BOOM #WeMeanBusiness #maga https://t.co/1PcCicKd3U

Have we become so partisan in America that we politicize the way our adversaries comment on the death of a war hero and long time Senator?  Please friends, families deserve time to grieve, let‚Äôs not take that away from the McCain‚Äôs nor any for that matter. Politics can wait.
This needs to be further explored as the potential motive. https://t.co/97oB3FxSsX

Mark, you fell into the same fact trap as others here.  Obama averaged &lt; 1.5% GDP for 8 years. @realDonaldTrump is averaging 2.7% GDP for 6 Quarters.  Fact!

This House Judiciary hearing... a total  waste of time and our tax dollars.   Allow me to conclude:: FBI Agent Strzok was and is biased and was derelict in his duty to conduct a fair and UNBIASED investigation of both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton personally.   #SWAMP
Anyone else watching the Democrats on the House Judiciary making a joke of the FBI Agent Peter Strzok hearing.  Strzok should be held in contempt and Rep Nadler should be disciplined.
The sole reason @NATO is recognized, respected and feared (a good thing) is America‚Äôs $650,000,000,000.00 commitment to a safer globe.  Without that, who knows what the global map would look like. Certainly not like it does now.
.@NATO Member countries are bound by agreement to spend a MINIMUM of 2% of their respective GDP on their own military. USA spends about 3.5% or $650 Billion. Germany about 1% or a mere $40 billion. Yet Germany and other NATO members benefit from our spending. Get it now? üá∫üá∏

Wait, anyone can walk into your home  and take up residence?  Use your resources? Call me skeptical Adventuregirl.. I‚Äôm not buying that!

Political asylum?  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but isn‚Äôt political asylum granted to those in fear of their lives from tyrannical governments? Or are you suggesting it should extend to those seeking a better economic situation.  Because that would be catastrophic https://t.co/m3VKpKEZKs

No I‚Äôm suggesting it was an unconstitutional surveillance of Trump. To accept your theory, we would have to believe @fbi was targeting Carter Page (not Trump) by planting ‚Äúspies‚Äù in Trump Campaign. &lt;- ludicrous https://t.co/RyjZjlLn0T
However counselor, we Constitutional Conservatives prefer rule of law which states that, in order to surveil an American, a FISA warrant is required... and that warrant should be based on evidence, not a shady oppo research ‚Äúdossier‚Äù paid for by the subjects political opponent. https://t.co/08q56w5YR1

Dear @USPS  You ‚Äúmock‚Äù @realDonaldTrump saying you‚Äôre NOT taxpayer ‚Äúfunded‚Äù Yet your pensions are ‚Äúbacked‚Äù by us, operate at a loss on every package delivered, operate at net loss/ accrued debt Think average citizens‚Äô business get that deal?   Think again, Eric Bolling, Taxpayer

I‚Äôd work for a single US $1 to help drain the swamp, plug the leaks, build the wall with Pesos, lower taxes, build infrastructure, protect #2A and save some parents from the scourge of opioids.  But that would mean working directly with POTUS, not near him. https://t.co/g8QvJt4J2L
Noted.. and that‚Äôs likely the reason for the leaks.  Coming to DC without the following of a career politico, Trump had to fill hundreds of material positions with anti-Trump GOP *seat fillers*. https://t.co/Je05Z6juDW
Exactly. ‚ÄúPoliticians‚Äù.  That‚Äôs what @realDonaldTrump was elected on, in no small part (certainly why I‚Äôve supported him from day 1) being a non-politician DC Swamp outsider.  So get started Mr Trump- plug the leaks, drain the swamp. Full stop. https://t.co/ygEum4dkoq
Disagree... wholeheartedly. https://t.co/K98ECudCWb
The $1.6 budget item for the start of a border wall irks me. I've mentioned several ways to build the wall AND have Mexico pay for it.   @realDonaldTrump please have your next US Ambassador to MX contact me. I look forward to assisting you on fulfilling another campaign promise

6 months ago today I lost my college sophomore, my only child, my son, my best friend.   To parents: ‚ÄúNot my child‚Äù syndrome is dangerous and deadly  To kids: ‚ÄúOne pill can kill‚Äù.   #opioidcrisis
Final word on ‚Äúfree trade agreements‚Äù.  FTAs always benefit smaller entity. The US, by definition, is the bigger player. Why would we agree to FTAs? We are in the best economic position without restrictive ‚Äúagreements‚Äù.  This isn‚Äôt global charity, IT‚ÄôS BUSINESS! @realDonaldTrump
...&gt; POTUS can threaten tariffs and even employ a tariff until the other side drops their tariff against the US. Then drop tariff and trade is not only freer it is fair as well. That‚Äôs how to use a tariff to free up trade. @realDonaldTrump understands that, cable newsers do not.
Please hold our media accountable. They are all misrepresenting ‚ÄúFree Trade‚Äù Free trade agreements are BARRIERS to the free flow of trade. They are restrictive and anti free market.   So are tariffs ... BUT, if used properly, tariffs can open trade avenues. Here‚Äôs how-&gt;
Please appoint an Economic Advisor who shares your and our vision of ‚ÄúAmerica üá∫üá∏ First‚Äù.   @realDonaldTrump your ‚ÄúAmerica üá∫üá∏ First‚Äù is a winning strategy. And we aren‚Äôt sick of winning yet!! üëç https://t.co/60sAKjEAsm

I served on a Board of Directors with Gary Cohn. Smart guy but I never agreed with his globalist view for America. I hope @realDonaldTrump appoints a Senior Economic Advisor replacement with his/our "America First" agenda.      üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

Great #SOTU Address .@realDonaldTrump  #1) I predicted this  #2) I weathered attack after attack but stood my ground (to liberals and Never Trumpers). I knew the "RIGHT" businessman as president would prevail  #3) Will re-enter the debate as the (grieving) process allows  #MAGA
Good night friends (and others, lol). My greatest hope is to continue to assist in the most urgent issue in the world to me- the opioid crisis.  Lives can be saved.  Let‚Äôs do this.

70,000 Americans will die from the #OpioidCrisis.  That is a factor in our declining life expectancy in the US. We can do better and will. I vow to do EVERYTHING in my power to help that cause. @SenSanders
Before @SenSanders and the ‚ÄúBernie Bro‚Äôs‚Äù get up in a huff... I‚Äôve advocated for years on Fox for a ‚Äúquasi-govt‚Äù solution. Non-mandated govt sponsored competition to the free market health care system. The added competition would pull prices lower. https://t.co/vKJSVpL8hW

The senate term vacated by Sen Jeff Sessions (Attorney General) will be a Dem (Doug Jones) seat until 2020 when it was set to expire. GOP May want to prepare now for the opportunity to bring that normally strong R seat back.
Now the GOPe needs to drop the politics and get behind the @realDonaldTrump agenda or they will, essentially, be handing over the majority to the D‚Äôs.
AP calls AL Senate seat for D Doug Jones.
AL Senate race has become very tight. Moore leads but heavy D (likely leaning Jones) counties still haven‚Äôt fully reported.
Some very big breaking news happening... FBI text messages show some alarming political bias BEFORE election. Reason it matters: Was the @realDonaldTrump Russian dossier funded or aided by FBI?
With the AL Senate race still being tallied. I can say with üíØ% certainty that Sen Shelby‚Äôs write-in vote did not have an effect. Lol.
Polls just closed in key AL Senate race..  Networks going with "Too close to call" for now, internally, Roy Moore camp is "confident".

*While 40+% of households pay no federal income tax.. the tax reform plan INCREASES those households tax relief (think about that)... yet some still claim it‚Äôs not enough of a tax on the wealthy (who already pay the vast majority of taxes collected).
