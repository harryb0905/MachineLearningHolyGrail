5) yet because my assessment of POTUS doesn’t fit the leftist and Anti-Trump narrative, my first hand (and willing on the record) information never makes it into those hit pieces.  Sad state of affairs in American J.  ETB
4) The President was in a perfectly matter of fact mood. Demeanor was the same as it has been with me in numerous other one-on-one meetings (not on-air interviews).  He spoke and listened.  I saw zero evidence of the hot tempered CIC portrayed in so many articles lately...
3) I just sat down with @realDonaldTrump for 30 minutes in the Oval and spent more time with he and @flotus at an event the next evening. He was engaged in the news of the day: Wall funding, Govt shutdown and an upcoming D majority in the house.  He was....
2) However, you must stop writing hit pieces on @realDonaldTrump using anaymous sources, aides with an agenda who leak and former associates looking to cut prison time deals with prosecutors...  For Trump, ‘a War Every Day,’ Waged Increasingly Alone   https://t.co/il6d0LVsIV
1) For the record I think @maggieNYT and @peterbakernyt are two of the finest reporters anywhere. And I am not one who believes @nytimes to be “Fake News”. In fact I’m a subscriber and daily reader.

NOT TIRED OF WINNING:   House passes a CR funding bill that includes $5b wall money.  Now do the right thing Senators. Do what we elected you to do and pass the house bill not your Democrat-like version.   @realDonaldTrump  #PromisesMade #PromisesKept
This is a MUST SEE.  We spend billions on benefits for illegal aliens and our Veterans are homeless, missing and some without teeth.. Unbelievable.   WATCH-&gt; https://t.co/PM3xqYBJke
One of the very few mistakes that man made in a stellar Presidency.  But very important to point out that there will be no better opportunity to fund the wall then right now.   That is, unless @realDonaldTrump exercises Obama-like Executive Order and do it in ... say in 2020 😜! https://t.co/9ZDVemxIG6

No law suggesting a sitting President can legally be indicted either Matt. How can a Commander In Chief (who presides over the DOJ) indict and investigate himself?

To those accusing me of “conspiracy”. -In FL a D district is moving in the D direction.  -In NM an R district is moving in the D direction  -In AZ an (?) district is moving in the D direction.   Not a conspiracy. Just a statistical anomaly worth looking into. For the republic🇺🇸.

WOW! @SRuhle...record job growth (again) record low unemployment, wages moving up for the first time in a decade. Rather than credit @realDonaldTrump low tax, low reg business environment, you opine about raising interest rates? Partisan much?  #DareToDebateMe? (Crickets) @MSNBC
250,000 jobs created last month per the Labor dept. A record for October jobs creation. *US unemployment remains at a 50 (fifty) year low.  If this doesn’t sway undecide/independent voters in the mid terms, these people should come clean and admit they’re partisan “Anti-Trumpers”
There’s reporting @statedeptspox #HeatherNauert was offered the UN Ambassador position. Heather was a colleague of mine for 11 years. She is one of the smartest and most prepared people I’ve ever shared a camera with. FULL STOP. She will serve America🇺🇸 and @realDonaldTrump well.

Question:  If the caravan is filled with people seeking asylum *why isn’t Mexico providing that? (Clearly the best solution to this “humanitarian” crisis).  Answer:  Because its likely not really about political asylum, it’s about migration to the US. Illegally, I might add.
Agree OD- But “presenting yourself” is the operative term in your comment.  Lawful processing and vetting is far different from busting down border barriers as this group has been doing. https://t.co/lVFBasoR2C

The 7,000+ and growing ”group” approaching the US from Central America through Mexico is:
Allow me to add that I do see there are families fleeing within the caravan. But there may likely be a bad element mixed in. We just can’t allow 1,000’s in unvetted! Mostly asking this question: “What do Democrats think we should do?”   Dems choose to ignore this huge story. Why?
*WHERE THE HELL ARE DEMOCRATS ON THE MOB HEADED TO OUR BORDER?  They’re NOT “migrants” they ARE a mob (breaking borders/laws) who may  be carrying drugs, weapons and guns within their ranks.  The massive “caravan” of unknowns should scare every law abiding American to the polls. https://t.co/RTvNmm9IOI

Exactly what I’ve been preaching!  @nytimes  • Mr. Trump’s threat to impose tariffs has sent other leaders scrambling. The European Union made a significant concession on Thursday, saying it would cut its existing penalties on automobiles to zero, provided the U.S. did the same.
Watch! Last week while debating MX Pres Vincente Fox I predicted Mexico WILL agree to renegotiate NAFTA. And Canada would come to the table soon after. This week Mexico agreed to a renegotiated NAFTA and today Canada is expected to come to the table.  #BOOM #WeMeanBusiness #maga https://t.co/1PcCicKd3U

Have we become so partisan in America that we politicize the way our adversaries comment on the death of a war hero and long time Senator?  Please friends, families deserve time to grieve, let’s not take that away from the McCain’s nor any for that matter. Politics can wait.
This needs to be further explored as the potential motive. https://t.co/97oB3FxSsX

Ok @ChrisCuomo I asked you a simple question about #antifa, you deflected with a Manafort and Cohen accusation.  I answered your accisations with cogent responses. Still no response so I offered you a segment on “AMericA”. Crickets 🦗  Open invite...  #NotHoldingMyBreath  #MSM

Manafort was found guilty of actions dating back to pre-Trump.  Cohen pled out and saved his own skin from addition time behind bars.

This is a critical moment for conservatism.  Do we: *A) blaze a new trail forward toward America First.. or *B) revert back to decades old and stale (and frankly tried and failed) policy?

President @realDonaldTrump standing next to Prime Minister Theresa May.. confidently and unapologetically delivers “America First” agenda from England.. the British and left leaning (I’m being generous) US press freaks out in 3...2...1.   #Maga #America
https://t.co/GUpW1DLSKW  @CLewandowski_ https://t.co/kW5b4A6OwH
This House Judiciary hearing... a total  waste of time and our tax dollars.   Allow me to conclude:: FBI Agent Strzok was and is biased and was derelict in his duty to conduct a fair and UNBIASED investigation of both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton personally.   #SWAMP
Anyone else watching the Democrats on the House Judiciary making a joke of the FBI Agent Peter Strzok hearing.  Strzok should be held in contempt and Rep Nadler should be disciplined.
The sole reason @NATO is recognized, respected and feared (a good thing) is America’s $650,000,000,000.00 commitment to a safer globe.  Without that, who knows what the global map would look like. Certainly not like it does now.
.@NATO Member countries are bound by agreement to spend a MINIMUM of 2% of their respective GDP on their own military. USA spends about 3.5% or $650 Billion. Germany about 1% or a mere $40 billion. Yet Germany and other NATO members benefit from our spending. Get it now? 🇺🇸
#LayerLisaPage https://t.co/tbeMz8oBq3
IT’s ABOUT DAMN TIME!   @realDonaldTrump holds dead-beat @NATO members accountable and the US left cries foul? We’ve been supporting these countries for too long. Hey @GermanyNATO et al: You want USA protections.... pay up- the amount you’ve already agreed to pay!   #MAGA AMericA

FACTS- .@realDonaldTrump Travel moratorium:  92% Muslim’s will unaffected  8% from terror states or failed governments will be.  8 Muslim majority &amp; non-Muslim majority nations on list. All have ties to terrorism.  Any can get OFF list if they meet criteria.  #maga #AMericA🇺🇸

My tweet threat this am-&gt; I exposed how the MSM media stacks the deck. While “appearing” to have a balanced debate on @realDonaldTrump policies, they (like most) stack the guesting with either Democrats or Anti-Trumpers. That’s shady! @ThisWeekABC  @GStephanopoulos   #AMericA🇺🇸

.@iamfonda This rhetoric exposes you as a vile, hate filled provocateur, nothing more. If you honestly care about the children/separation issue, offer solutions that both sides may agree upon. Not just pick fights.  Note to my friends, don’t engage this moron.  #AMERICA🇺🇸 https://t.co/zxtFlYKeDl
What the hell is wrong with you?  Solving this crisis will take negotiating on both sides of the political wall. This asinine rhetoric only divides us further.   * Liberals, you need to speak up and discourage clowns like this from spreading this disgusting hate.   #AMERICA🇺🇸 https://t.co/s8uF0uZWXt
Marilee, as I get caught up in the politics of the day, it’s tweets like this that stop me in my tracks. I am so much more than an ideologue since our loss. Thank you for reminding me.  God 🙏Bless your family for your loss. We may never have a simple day again. Praying for you. https://t.co/AIROxMdMUb
Wait, anyone can walk into your home  and take up residence?  Use your resources? Call me skeptical Adventuregirl.. I’m not buying that!    That said, unlike many hardliners, for years, I have recommended substantial increases in legal immigration.  Up to triple current levels. https://t.co/x24fgY6uQO
Let’s have a smart discussion of the most pressing issue facing America today- our southern border. Hardline right and hardline left won’t be acceptable this time. A sensible rule of law AND humanitarian solution can and should be arrived at.  I have ideas!   AMERICA🇺🇸 https://t.co/Ef7YtkAwls
Political asylum?  Correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t political asylum granted to those in fear of their lives from tyrannical governments? Or are you suggesting it should extend to those seeking a better economic situation.  Because that would be catastrophic https://t.co/m3VKpKEZKs
My solution:  - Strict border security - Increase legal immigration 3 fold - Document, not deport all illegals.  #BigWallBigGate  #America🇺🇸 https://t.co/qPHkW6rI6O
Oh and John, why does your property have a wall around it?  Asking for a friend.   #AMERICA🇺🇸 https://t.co/qPHkW6rI6O
No F-you John.  Lemme guess, you don’t leave your front door open for strangers to walk in and take what they need/want. If a family did and camped out in your basement.. you’d DEF NOT call the police, right John??  I say stop bitching and do something productive.  #AMERICA🇺🇸 https://t.co/II1JecuN0d
*EXACTLY!! https://t.co/7ri4GxUXw0
Thank you Linda. We launch on the Fourth of July because.... AmERICa🇺🇸 https://t.co/Pv2kd9KQ18
No “negotiate” as in compromise to solve a problem.  Heads up liberal- The weaker hand always has to give more- &gt; a fact of politics/business/life. https://t.co/UW8xBnS7u2
Negotiate!  You’re in the minority party in both chambers and 1600.  Get some concessions- if not, it’s your problem for electing incompetent representatives.  Or... just continue to bit@h about everything, fixing nothing.  #AmERICa https://t.co/w1VTLtu1H4
Immigration is headlining all media and policy debates across America.   Both parties are to blame for a fragmented and inconsistently administered policy. Republicans AND DEMOCRATS need to quit the bs blame games and solve the problem now. It’s not rocket science!!  #AmERICa🇺🇸

Is this somehow problematic Asawin? Is it bad to have a friend in the White House? And frankly, President Trump was more of a friend to Adrienne and me when we lost Our son than people I’ve know longer &amp; people I used to work with. I’m blessed to count @realDonaldTrump a friend. https://t.co/yxcomV7XkO

Our founders protected the unabridged freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the #FirstAmendment. Those freedoms are being attacked around the world (see Britain v Robinson). Central to who we are, #1A, we need to stop that virus from spreading to our shores.  #AMERICA🇺🇸

Really @netflix?  *“It’s not The Obama Network,” Sarandos said last week. “There’s no political slate to the programming” - The Obama Show - Michelle Wolf Show - Chelsea Handler Show (cxl)  How about some balance-&gt; “AMericA🇺🇸”   #What’veYouGotToLose?  * https://t.co/cx5sT8cJO5
“Obama’s” @netflix vs “AMericA🇺🇸” @crtv.com/eric   @johnbonazzo 1- I’ve never condoned boycotts (Netflix/others) https://t.co/cx5sT8cJO5  2- I stand by my conservative viewers-We’ll out rate the lopsided volume of progressive content on #NETFLIX platform  #What’veTheyGotToLose?

Yesterday- @realDonaldTrump announced trade sanctions to strengthen US businesses   Last night- Anti-Trump media slam the policy, warns of global trade war  This am- Jobs report shows record high US employment, Black employment, women employed..   Today- Media deflated, sad faces
How convenient....!  @GeraldoRivera no interest in my charitable wager?  I can’t say I blame you- @StephenCurry30, KD, at al.   Have a great #2018NBAFinals all!!!
Thank y’all...  From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate each and every one of our group! The best and most loyal team in media. Social and otherwise. 🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸 https://t.co/C38R2ZkeO2

It’s just inconsistent and hard to believe.
Eric Chase had barely turned 19. He still felt like our little boy. You have no idea how much we miss him. God bless your son. Pray he stays clean friend. https://t.co/VVc2dNPelF
Question: We’re expected to believe @fbi placed an undercover “informant” inside @realDonaldTrump 2016 campaign to ”protect” it from Russians..  Further, they believed Russia was trying to undermine @HillaryClinton campaign *but did NOT place an “informant” in hers?  #AMericA🇺🇸
Hey “Captain” @GeraldoRivera..   You up for some “action”?  I’ll take @StephenCurry30 and GSW.  You got @KingJames and CLV.  For charity- (TBD).  You don’t *win championships with “inspired sidekicks”   You *win with @KDTrey5 and @KlayThompson. https://t.co/hOsOqAzX99
Lost in the Roseanne kerfuffle yesterday: 144 Americans died of drug (predominantly opioid) overdoses.  Sadly today, tomorrow, everyday the number is the same (on average).  Have the difficult conversation with kids, friends, co-workers.  “One Pill Can Kill” “Not My Kid” Syndrome
@therealroseanne’s “joke” WAS racist. And not funny. That said, she has every right to say it. And @ABC has every right to cancel her show. This is how the free market works. The show was a hit. Bob Iger didn’t make an ideological decision, he made a business decision.
Opioids see no color, no age, no religion. They kill indiscriminately.  LISTEN TO ME- I’m fighting for all races creeds, classes, genders.  Please join me. We can use all hands on deck. We are losing the war. I hate losing 🇺🇸 https://t.co/Q4W9MXkHOI
“Druggies”. That’s how you describe 60,000 dead Americans last year?  As some are “addicts” they need help. Others die accidentally.  These families need help, NOT stigmatization...  Find your soul please. https://t.co/YJEfRk56Iq
There are many reasons overdoses (overwhelmingly opioids) kill more Americans than guns, cars, even breast cancer: - Illegal fake pills - over production/availability  - stigma for addicted and families “not my child” syndrome - lack of education to dangers: “one pill can kill”
Losing a child is the worst hell imaginable. I’m sorry for your loss. Overprescribing is one of many deadly tentacles on the opioid octopus. https://t.co/LMGc2ppoJF
This Big Pharma “knew” their opioid drug OxyContin was being abused (crushed and snorted) yet aggressively marketed it anyway. Story via: @nytimes   https://t.co/ZCYvmuES2W
Hey @netflix we don’t bite...  You have ample content from the political “progressive” POV.... how about some content from we “conservatives”? (Pssst.. we represent the other 1/2 of America- 160 million or so!)  #NetflixAMericAChallenge  RT widely —^  #AMericA🇺🇸 https://t.co/ZWOjqqND3c

#TheObamasVsAMericA https://t.co/mgF4yJny0U
.@netflix You have and had plenty of progressive content: Chelsea Handler Show, The Obamas, et al.  How about trying out conservative content?  “AMericA” I guarantee a highly engaged audience.  Calling on our conservative base.. tell @netflix we want to go toe-to-toe with Obamas!
My son was twice the man you are. God save you evil soul. https://t.co/IbjRClczYx
“The Obamas” vs “AMericA” on @Netflix  How about it Friends, #ViewCrew, @realDonaldTrump supporters. Get behind this deal. Make @Netflix an offer they can’t refuse!
.@netflix  I, like @realDonaldTrump, love to make deals.  How about this deal...  @netflix picks up “AMericA🇺🇸”   You release the two shows “Obama’s Show” and “AMericA” side-by -side.  Our conservative viewers vs your liberal viewers.   @netflix.. you up for the challenge?
No one has ever tweeted for me... keep drinking the liberal Kool-aid.  AMericA🇺🇸 is steeped in authentic Americana. https://t.co/XloszeNgqc
There IS another pro-AMericAN alternative to The Obama’s on @netflix...   We will celebrate this great country and our Super-successful President @realDonaldTrump   *Join the growing movement.   “AMericA”🇺🇸... on @crtv.com/eric https://t.co/q3WVVUpGfT

I have some very sensible ideas on immigration.  1) Triple legal immigration.  AMericA🇺🇸can and should welcome those who qualify.  2) Document all illegals (states) via DMV-like stations. They pay taxes.  3) Build the Wall, protect the borders.  #HugeWallBigGates #AMericA🇺🇸 https://t.co/v1nqOLT6uI

I’m pretty sure @realDonaldTrump won’t lose any sleep over it. After all, an overpriced under delivered place littered with c-list celebrities and Fat Cat bankers doesn’t sound very appetizing, does it? https://t.co/CIxCWsn9rR
Wage growth declined under Bush 43. And was stagnant under Obama. Get your own facts straight pal https://t.co/5sxz8Q0fY3
No offense intended Sheila. Please take an Econ 101 course. Business profitability raises wages as companies compete for labor to support growth.  Wages were stagnant under Bush and Obama but now, finally improving. https://t.co/AkVfpvFTUX
Daily I read &amp; watch a ton of mostly political material.  I spend time on biz sites also It blows me away how many Anti- @realDonaldTrump “journalists” are rooting for an economic downturn  Real business leaders love Trump -lower tax -deregulation -China trade  #AMericA🇺🇸 #maga
When @realDonaldTrump canceled the NoKo Summit , a ton of mud was slung by the anti-Trump media. Thing is, Trump knows how to cut a deal. Case in point-&gt; Look who now wants to reopen the negotiations-  https://t.co/2DmG6ywGPI  Guess who holds the cards now?  #maga #AMericA🇺🇸

I suggest we stop policing the world for others. Here, the “Brit living in Sweden” has a problem with the way Trump is dealing with psychotic Kim Jung Un Meanwhile this Brit’s beloved Europe has the firepower to stand up to Kim, just lacking the *guts* to do so!  * see WWII🇺🇸 https://t.co/enhJEgvjNt
Your bio says you’re a “Brit living in Sweden”. Why don’t you take your grievances up with your own government(s)?   Millions of us.. real conservatives.. choose to support @realDonaldTrump   He is: AMericA First and personally, I live it and love it! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  #MAGAmate https://t.co/dzrRay1M7L

You asked “worst case”. Worst case is illegal use of FISA, illegal evidence, placing of spies on Americans versus “informants”.  “Read a book?” Quit being a damn hypocrite. Read your own tweet, clown. https://t.co/ntNsdRwwLi
#4A https://t.co/wwVsmxJOsr
No I’m suggesting it was an unconstitutional surveillance of Trump. To accept your theory, we would have to believe @fbi was targeting Carter Page (not Trump) by planting “spies” in Trump Campaign. &lt;- ludicrous https://t.co/RyjZjlLn0T
However counselor, we Constitutional Conservatives prefer rule of law which states that, in order to surveil an American, a FISA warrant is required... and that warrant should be based on evidence, not a shady oppo research “dossier” paid for by the subjects political opponent. https://t.co/08q56w5YR1
This Strassel thread succinctly sums up the constitutional argument. https://t.co/TPRF2QnmAu
Has anyone seen Jeff Sessions?  Has he been rendered incapacitated? Has he been devoured by the Swamp?  Asking because a real AG would have stepped in and shut down this circus by now.  Worried about him... poor guy.

Allow me to explain the huge ramifications if there was a “spy” placed inside @realDonaldTrump campaign.   To do so, @FBI is required to get a FISA court warrant.. if that warrant was granted BASED ON THE SHADY “Steele Dossier”....*Wow*  #ConstitutionalCrisis  #AMericA🇺🇸
Which show will become must-see tv for political junkies both elected and electorate?

Yeah , I “got it”?  Do you? There are 300 million firearms in the US. Nobody knows what “%” that represents worldwide. Those firearms are used to protect Americans from bad people.

No Will, I believe the anti-Trump media intentionally obscured what the President is saying to fit their narrative.  If you listen to the full comment he clearly references MS-13.

Chris: To some, a drug-dealing gang member (MS-13) is an “animal” whether he/she is black, white, hispanic or any other race. “Animal” is a metaphor for one doing harm to others.

Happy Finally Friday Folks!!  On a 4/6/8 no less.  🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸
Yesterday Main Stream Media talking heads were falling over themselves blaming @realDonaldTrump for the Amazon stock drop  @amazon stock up big today....  Those same Talking Heads now.?... “🦗🦗🦗(Crickets) “
“Trade” was my business.  Prior to tv, I spent 15 years trading oil and gas globally. I am a free trade advocate.  There IS a way to use tariffs as a negotiating tool. I highly recommend @realDonaldTrump and @larry_kudlow use tariffs this way and NOT as a permanent solution🇺🇸
Don’t get my tweets today wrong.... I am NOT anti- @amazon    I love their innovation and success. What I am against is anti-feee market, government (and therefore, by definition, taxpayer) “backed” entities. Without Amazon, @usps would owe us a ton more $$ than they already do.
Here’s a @wsj piece outlining the “Amazon $1.46 loss per package analysis.   https://t.co/td7sYLIIQA
Econ101 when operating *expenses exceed revenues.   * before y’all flip out- for “apples-to-apples” analysis, don’t forget to add back the “would-be” cost of taxpayer backed “sweetheart” pension &amp; debt service deals  Econ 202 you can’t stay afloat charging below market rates https://t.co/MHPB0unTe7
.@USPS Here’s a novel idea. How about letting the free market work. Charge “market rate” for services   Yes, prices may rise amid economic growth, fall during contraction.  Then taxpayers aren’t on the hook for your liabilities.   Ps: sell some of your vast real estate holdings?
Dear @USPS  You “mock” @realDonaldTrump saying you’re NOT taxpayer “funded” Yet your pensions are “backed” by us, operate at a loss on every package delivered, operate at net loss/ accrued debt Think average citizens’ business get that deal?   Think again, Eric Bolling, Taxpayer
Big Banana: Cable newsers claim “none of that is true” (@realDonaldTrump re: Amazon use of USPS)  An Apple: 1) The US Postal Service is, in fact, taxpayer “backed” An Apple: 2) USPS loses $1.46 each Amazon package it delivers  *Big Apple TrumpDerangementSyndrome thrives in media

Andy. There is a time for politics (and it’s  divisiveness) and a time to help humanity. Opioids know no political affiliation. You’ve been a good friend to the cause. Thank you. Let’s get Ellen on board! https://t.co/zNVqHlClSR

C’mon Washington Examiner.. Don’t spread any more fake news than is already being shoveled out there. https://t.co/PuCKQSZ7gs
I’ve received a bunch of requests to “explain” my ideas on how to get Mexico to pay for the southern border wall. If you’d like to hear the ideas that @realDonaldTrump should use, tune in to Breitbart on SiriusXM tonight at 9pET. (Sirius Ch. 125)
I’d work for a single US $1 to help drain the swamp, plug the leaks, build the wall with Pesos, lower taxes, build infrastructure, protect #2A and save some parents from the scourge of opioids.  But that would mean working directly with POTUS, not near him. https://t.co/g8QvJt4J2L
Noted.. and that’s likely the reason for the leaks.  Coming to DC without the following of a career politico, Trump had to fill hundreds of material positions with anti-Trump GOP *seat fillers*. https://t.co/Je05Z6juDW
Exactly. “Politicians”.  That’s what @realDonaldTrump was elected on, in no small part (certainly why I’ve supported him from day 1) being a non-politician DC Swamp outsider.  So get started Mr Trump- plug the leaks, drain the swamp. Full stop. https://t.co/ygEum4dkoq
Disagree... wholeheartedly. https://t.co/K98ECudCWb
The $1.6 budget item for the start of a border wall irks me. I've mentioned several ways to build the wall AND have Mexico pay for it.   @realDonaldTrump please have your next US Ambassador to MX contact me. I look forward to assisting you on fulfilling another campaign promise
When every discussion, policy idea, private conversation is leaked to the press, the country suffers immeasurable damage as does your presidency.   -Plug the White House leaks -Publicly fire the leakers -Hire people you can trust  I would make this priority #1  @realDonaldTrump

Nor’easter 4 has arrived. Bundle up folks. https://t.co/diC31aCd1d
I have a couple suggestions for @realDonaldTrump on the dangerous leaks coming from the White House:  1) Publicly fire and “perp-walk” all leakers on the spot 2) Find true Trump supporters to fill open positions. NOT Establishment, Anti-Trump or globalists 3) Resume #maga
.@realDonaldTrump deserves better from his inner-circle. The leak about prepared remarks from the Putin call is a material national security risk. The leaker should go to prison.  #PlugTheLeaks #DrainTheSwamp  #JailTheLeakers

6 months ago today I lost my college sophomore, my only child, my son, my best friend.   To parents: “Not my child” syndrome is dangerous and deadly  To kids: “One pill can kill”.   #opioidcrisis
Final word on “free trade agreements”.  FTAs always benefit smaller entity. The US, by definition, is the bigger player. Why would we agree to FTAs? We are in the best economic position without restrictive “agreements”.  This isn’t global charity, IT’S BUSINESS! @realDonaldTrump
...&gt; POTUS can threaten tariffs and even employ a tariff until the other side drops their tariff against the US. Then drop tariff and trade is not only freer it is fair as well. That’s how to use a tariff to free up trade. @realDonaldTrump understands that, cable newsers do not.
Please hold our media accountable. They are all misrepresenting “Free Trade” Free trade agreements are BARRIERS to the free flow of trade. They are restrictive and anti free market.   So are tariffs ... BUT, if used properly, tariffs can open trade avenues. Here’s how-&gt;
Please appoint an Economic Advisor who shares your and our vision of “America 🇺🇸 First”.   @realDonaldTrump your “America 🇺🇸 First” is a winning strategy. And we aren’t sick of winning yet!! 👍 https://t.co/60sAKjEAsm
I’m watching cable newsers butcher the ramifications of Gary Cohn’s departure .. hint: America will prosper with him gone. Cohn (and Goldman Sachs) have always been globalists. @realDonaldTrump was elected to put America 🇺🇸 First. “Free trade agreements” aren’t free trade
I served on a Board of Directors with Gary Cohn. Smart guy but I never agreed with his globalist view for America. I hope @realDonaldTrump appoints a Senior Economic Advisor replacement with his/our "America First" agenda.      🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Weekend has arrived. Not a bad time to take the opportunity to talk to your kids about the dangers of opioids. They may not know what’s in these street drugs. Fentanyl can kill in hours/minutes.
I can’t imagine how sorry your life must be to say something like this. https://t.co/PyfiK7yhnx

How the hell did the FISA court grant a warrant to surveil an American based on a purchased and partially debunked information (dossier).  Who are the judges at FISA?   Who appoints them?  We 🇺🇸want answers.   #keepdigging
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 How on God’s green Earth does a FISA Court NOT ask about the source of the Dossier???   Or did they?  @realDonaldTrump keep tugging at this thread. The whole sweater is about to unravel.
Whoa!!!! Memo says (among other things) FISA warrant was wholly dependent on the sketchy “dossier”.   Think about that for a minute...  anti-trump parties, in essence, paid to have Trump wiretapped. That’s a MASSIVE violation of American’s constitutional rights.  #ReleaseTheMemo

Why the “memo” matters: It may expose Obama Admin used FBI to spy on an American citizens (@realDonaldTrump &amp; others). If they surveilled Trump, they needed FISA warrant. If the got warrant, evidence used is VERY important. A dossier..paid for by ______? &lt;—Memo may fill in blank
.@realDonaldTrump used the word “America” 80 times in his #sotu speech. For me, that was both presidential and patriotic. For the ACLU (AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union) it was problematic.  #NotKidding   https://t.co/gHsVoxuUGk
No truer words ever. We both lost our only child. I haven’t fully wrapped my mind around that yet tbh. They say in time, things become more clear. Not easier, just better understood.

Good night friends (and others, lol). My greatest hope is to continue to assist in the most urgent issue in the world to me- the opioid crisis.  Lives can be saved.  Let’s do this.

Before @SenSanders and the “Bernie Bro’s” get up in a huff... I’ve advocated for years on Fox for a “quasi-govt” solution. Non-mandated govt sponsored competition to the free market health care system. The added competition would pull prices lower. https://t.co/vKJSVpL8hW

The senate term vacated by Sen Jeff Sessions (Attorney General) will be a Dem (Doug Jones) seat until 2020 when it was set to expire. GOP May want to prepare now for the opportunity to bring that normally strong R seat back.
Now the GOPe needs to drop the politics and get behind the @realDonaldTrump agenda or they will, essentially, be handing over the majority to the D’s.
AP calls AL Senate seat for D Doug Jones.
AL Senate race has become very tight. Moore leads but heavy D (likely leaning Jones) counties still haven’t fully reported.
Some very big breaking news happening... FBI text messages show some alarming political bias BEFORE election. Reason it matters: Was the @realDonaldTrump Russian dossier funded or aided by FBI?
With the AL Senate race still being tallied. I can say with 💯% certainty that Sen Shelby’s write-in vote did not have an effect. Lol.
Polls just closed in key AL Senate race..  Networks going with "Too close to call" for now, internally, Roy Moore camp is "confident".

dizzylizzy.. under your tax theory- if you earn, you pay. Earn more, pay more... That would ALSO mean: earn less, pay less.  Right now, many HH’s earn but pay nothing or get refunds. So your theory is very “regressive”. https://t.co/jxhDZjK3ZT
*While 40+% of households pay no federal income tax.. the tax reform plan INCREASES those households tax relief (think about that)... yet some still claim it’s not enough of a tax on the wealthy (who already pay the vast majority of taxes collected).

Admittedly, higher earners receive a larger tax break.. but let’s remember- top 1% pay almost 1/2 all taxes, bottom 80% account for only15%

Flight WAS overbooked. They offered $200 then $300 (plus room). Then they asked for carry on volunteers. https://t.co/06QfaS8CvI
This is kinda crazy- @united charges $200+ fee if you change your departure. And starts at only $200 when they "overbook" #CustomerService?
(2 of 2)  Free advice to @united: Ease back on the algorithm and "underbook" for awhile.  Profits may take a small hit but the PR's worth it https://t.co/Eqergl7oyv
Update- apparent seat sit handled, @united now asking for volunteers to check carry on bags. (1 of 2)-&gt; https://t.co/rzCvxKWJ4T
Update- @united gate agent "still looking for volunteers".  Up the offer to $300 and a room. (Have they learned nothing??) https://t.co/i7pSrPojyo
Uh oh... @united gate agent just informed us flight from Denver to NY is in an "oversold situation". (Oversold by *15*) $200 and a room. https://t.co/T0nYngSpjS
