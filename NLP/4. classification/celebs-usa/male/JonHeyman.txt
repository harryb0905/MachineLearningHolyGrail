Aaron Hicks and Yankees agree to 70M, 7 year extension. @JackCurryYES 1st
@CaptainCarbomb No
@mr_rodgers_phl I’ve said there are many still in that is correct I know u want your team to get him and they still have a good chance. Don’t take it on me that there r indeed teams in
@DavePaglione @RLSandack Crap? By saying there are other teams? Hilarious logic by you
@Infante54 @JesseSanchezMLB Eggs?
@RLSandack I’ve said there are others teams in and been ripped for that cause some were assuming the phillies had won now I’m being ripped for saying the Phils appeared to have a good chance? Lol now I’ve heard of everything. Fortunately I will be the only one with the ridiculous thought
Dodgers look like big threat at moment since it is well known Harper loves a big stage. Plus, they wisely reset their tax last year. Still, it’s a surprise in terms of positional needs and recent M.O., which has included staying away from big ticket items.
@Mike0leary @shamus_clancy Because I’ve suggested there are still other teams in? Funny logic by you.
Dodgers’ late Harper involvement is quite a surprise. Their presence in Vegas (via @JesseSanchezMLB) suggests they are serious tho there was no hint of this earlier. Uncertain if it was triggered by Padres’ splash, #SFGIants involvement  or something else. But it’s quite a twist.
The revelation via @JesseSanchezMLB that the Dodgers are now in on Harper is an interesting twist to say the least. Have heard there are 5 teams in at moment, though the situation is fluid. https://t.co/XhdnZqCbCK
@shamus_clancy Tell me what I’ve written that’s wrong. I said your team may get him but there r other teams involved. How do you look st yourself after saying mean things to someone You know nothing about?
@Louis_Cav Clever. But maybe pay closer attention instead of being blinded by team colors as I said your team may get him but other teams r involved
@TruMark_ES Pay closer attention
@MomMomKalnin True or faker no one believes me is my favorite sense. So I am writing true things and the mob doesn’t believe me? And that’s my fault? I hope you don’t teach your children to puke on snd treat someone poorly who is doing his job.
@MomMomKalnin I know you want your team to get him and as ive said they may but there are other teams involved so I feel I need to hedge. Your team may get him but You are jumping to conclusions and saying nasty things about someone you don’t know.
@geo7195 Go team
@mr_rodgers_phl I know you want the phillies to get him. But all I’ve said is there are other teams involved. Not sure why that should end my career. If you don’t think there are other teams involved you know little
@Stuperbowl I know you want the phillies to get him and they may. But nsmecalling is uncalled for.
@GaryPhilly I know you want the Phillies to get him but your name calling is childish Yoy have no idea you are just repeating nasty stuff about someone you don’t know anything about
Best to Ben, who carries on a great sports legacy https://t.co/pWYN0Axl7c
Not to say the Phillies aren’t logical or favored but there are said to be more teams for Team Bryce to meet with in Las Vegas. Philly has plenty going for them: improving team, engaged fan base, positive meetings, relationship with Middleton, dumb $. But derby continues.
@KenCageRepo @PhilliesMike I along with every other reporter with one exception hedge because u never know how these things turn out. Cano pujols Arod Greinke manny all went to the surprise team. I have said your phillies r the favorite many times. Understand u r a fan but childish name calling is a Nono
Great idea. Nick was the best. https://t.co/V7md3YRUGc
Hanley Ramirez has minors deal with Indians, pending physical. @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
Middleton is now on his way back east, reports @JSalisburyNBCS this was the expectation yesterday. Middleton was not expected to close the deal in this meeting https://t.co/laztc3Emsc
While Phillies are seen as the favorite (and may well be), team Harper has been negotiating in Vegas with two teams who were there to see Bryce today, “with more to follow”
Agree. Kimbrel is inarguably one of the greatest closers ever, and relievers are allegedly more important than ever. If he can’t find good offers, something’s wrong. https://t.co/LLtMZaWMMH
Harper asking price is said by some involved teams to be in 350/360M range. The case is that while Harper and Machado may be comparable on field and similar age, Harper has real value off field due to cachet/fame. Some owners concede this tho some claim it’s “hard to quantify”
White Sox final offer to Machado was 250M over 8 years plus 9th and 10th year vesting options at 35M apiece based on plate appearances and 30M more in incentives/escalators that could have taken it to 350M. @Ken_Rosenthal had most/all of this.
While White Sox see asking price for Harper as beyond their comfort level, they remain in touch, in case. At his visit to Chicago, an MJ statue was adorned with Chisox Harper jersey. They have many excellent OF prospects coming (Eloy, Robert, Rutherford) but are thin in OF now.
While it’s been mentioned here and elsewhere that Philly may not be Harper’s favorite city (he loves big stage so NYY, Bos, Cubs would be among top choices had they been in) but in current field Philly the city is no detriment; he likes the Northeast and sports-crazed atmosphere
Honesty. Love it https://t.co/y0bh8wkoj7
Outfield market has been a beast but market is picking up for Denard Span. 2 win player last year, 112 OPS plus. Possible teams include: Det Mets Mia Clev CWS
@AnthonyDiComo Re-pete after me, it’s Pete
Jose Martinez gets 3.25M, 2 years. Plus incentives. Would have been 1st time arb next year.
Heard again Philly is among teams that could be a possible landing spot for Keuchel. Padres apparently are not. They are looking at adding a starter but don’t see a fit.
Reds have a deal with Jose Iglesias. Another nice move for them to get such a terrific ss to agree to backup role. @ctrent with the good sleuth work as he found a locker for Jose in Goodyear.
@tdaddy1016 I’ve said phillies are favored in almost every tweet! Is there any chance the agent would want me to say that assuming it’s right of course? No chance. As for wash I have conceded it seems unlikely but he said the Fiore open a crack
@Folesylvania @JoeG4133 He also said the door is open a crack, and I don’t like to assume. Agreed as I’ve said they seem less likely than the other known teams. I’ve said phillies are favored!!!! Many times
@JoeG4133 Everyone knows he’s going to phillies? Only 1 media person has come close to suggesting he’s surely going. I’ve said they r the favorite. But hedging is appropriate. Mystery team got camp pujols Arod manny
@McHarnish I’ve said philly is the favorite many tines. Why would he want me to say that. It is appropriate to hedge surprise team got manny pujols camp ariod. You are a shallow thinker who’s letting Faron override logic and also a rude person
@PhilaFanInMD Be upset then. But don’t blame the messenger. Mystery team got Cliff Lee manny cano pujols. It is appropriate to hedge are to hedge but I’ve said phillie is favored
@FISHTOWNJACK I hedged with Cliff Lee and with manny and was right to do so. I’ve said they are the favorite. Why would the agent want me to say that? He wouldn’t
@whoseon3rd It is appropriate to hedge as i did with manny. And guess what a surprise team got him.
@MarkusSnarkus I know surprise teams can win as one did with manny. I know it is appropriate to hedge. Thanks for your nature analysis tho
@andy_schreiber If it is going to be phillie would he want me saying constantly that they seem like the favorite? Which I have done many times. Of course there are other teams. I believe it’s appropriate to hedge as I did with manny . You are just repeating what you’ve seen upset/nervous fanssay
Phillies fans should be last ones upset by mention of potential surprise teams. Possible 1st mention of “mystery team” term appeared on this feed when everyone assumed Cliff Lee derby was between Yankees and Rangers. Not only was there mystery team, but Philly actually got him.
Phillie fans have been into it and enthusiastic about this potential signing like I’ve never seen. As suggested here and elsewhere they do seem like favorite. And for good reason (park, team, $) but even mention of other teams in bidding sets off some. Why assume they’re alone?

@NatsAndCats He said the doors open a crack also. I would agree their chances don’t look great but I don’t like to rule anyone completely out unless I feel it’s 100 percent.
@CarlDBradley Thanks for the nice word
@CarlDBradley Thanks for the nice words
@Feinsand @jareddiamond I’d steer clear of McGwire if I’m you tho
While Nats owner Mark Lerner, in saying they’re “moving on,” left door open “a crack,” father Ted is a wild card and Nats people would prefer Harper go anywhere but Philly, it feels now like SF, SD and maybe even the dreaded mystery team r bigger threats to favored Phils.
Chisox wouldn’t hang up if Harper were to call but they are not in aggressive pursuit. They made a sincere try for Machado but believe the numbers are getting too high for Harper. Saw MM, who also would have played 3B for them, as better positional and $ fit.
While Philly appears to be in strong position, word is there is no deal yet with Bryce, and no expectation he will be returning east with Phillies owner John Middleton. “Just a meeting,” is the official word. SF, SD, Wash, maybe 1 more still in the game to varying degrees.
Phillies owner John Middleton appears to be flying solo (or at least he’s at the Bryce Vegas meeting w/o MacPhail/Klentak). Phils have long felt like favorite, thanks to great park (esp for lefty sluggers), improving team and of course “stupid $.” JM obvs hoping to close deal.

hard as it is to believe, the padres have not ruled out signing bryce harper, too. ownership will meet tomorrow to see if they can make it 2 for 2 on this winter's mega stars. not seen as a likelihood, but apparently not out of the question, either.
a wonderful read on a wonderful man https://t.co/GSDtW0uZD3
the padres have a chance to have among the best defensive teams in baseball, with machado, hosmer, hedges and more.
Manny Machado has agreed to play 3B from the start for the padres, which is a treat for all. also leaves SS open for when phenom Fernando Tatis Jr. is ready.

If the #SFGiants got the meeting and are still in, they surely showed a willingness to go long and aren’t adhering to that short-term theory. It’s a great city and great org, but they are “in transition” and Oracle is the toughest in MLB for a lefty slugger.  Those are hurdles.

While Phillies seem like favorite for Bryce (and may well be), incumbent Nats shouldn’t be discounted. While Nats have spent good $ (Corbin, Dozier, Suzuki, etc.) and once seemed ready to move on, they love BH, and final call will be Ted Lerner’s, who signed Scherzer in surprise.

Phillies' total focus right now is on bryce harper. after harper signs (either with them or elsewhere), philly will consider dallas keuchel and/or craig kimbrel. one person thought keuchel's more likely since the pen is solid with robertson is aboard, but it could be either guy.

Josh Harrison gets MLB deal with tigers @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
Goin on @SteinyAndGuru on @957thegame in 15 minutes. More talk about a certain free agent outfielder I suspect!
The #SFGiants are telling people they are trying hard for Harper (this likely debunks the short-term theory for them, as it’s known Harper isn’t signing short-term deal). However, people who have spoken to SF brass said they aren’t necessarily overly optimistic.
Bryce Harper is believed to have turned down multiple offers over 300M in recent weeks. at least 5 teams are believed still in contact, tho Philly, SF and perhaps Wash appear to have more chance than SD (just gave 300M to Manny) and CWS (seemed more focused on MM)
no evidence NYY ever made official offer to Machado, but word is that at their dinner dec. 19 at Morini on Madison he was given the idea he could get in $220M-$240M range from them. while belief was he wanted to be in NY, ultimately he preferred to go for $. &amp; obvs he got the $.
Tyler Clippard goes to Indians. minors deal for $1.75M in majors plus $1M incentives
ChiSox gave a sincere effort for Manny, bidding 250M for 8 plus 2 vesting options that could have made it 320M late Monday. Their people seemed very disappointed not to get him. Philly, which appeared to prefer Harper anyway, had a certain valuation for MM and stuck to it.
Tulo is unusual in that he got a full no-trade on a contract for the minimum but didn’t have one on his 140M contract (thus the trade to Toronto) https://t.co/VUm9Jynpjm
Very good column on a great and under appreciated man https://t.co/o9bNiFAeGV
Machado told other teams that 1 thing he didn’t like about the Dodgers was being on the West Coast. Again, nothing wrong with selecting the team based on the deal — and 300M is a big deal — but hopefully he likes it better this time.
Mariners are among teams interested in Martin Maldonado, one of many major league free agents still out there

Pecota was a better ballplayer than projector. The Cubs won’t finish last. https://t.co/O0KpSsGAut
Chisox were working hard and in the bidding until late last night. Potential 350M (with lower taxes) plus brother in law plus best friend sounds pretty good. But in the end all MM and agent ever wanted was the biggest guarantee, which is of course within their right. https://t.co/Vi5MIS1nds
Padres are pulling off one surprise (once Manny’s finalized) but here’s another shocker : they aren’t ruling out Bryce Harper, too. 110M payroll (with MM) is still lower than most.
Good point by Hank https://t.co/X30leT4mcV
As the Machado decision proves once again: Blood may be thicker than water, but money is a lot thicker than both of them.
Not only has Machado not passed the physical yet but one hasn’t even been set up yet. Padres people clearly weren’t ready to announce anything. But hard to see it falling apart now. Both sides seem pleased.
Manny/SD deal really isn’t done yet. But, said a person involved: “Do I expect it to get done, yeah, I do.” The 300M is agreed to. So is breakdown, in general terms (flat across the board — about 30M each year) and opt-out after 5 yrs. But no-trade clause and more: not finalized.
Big winners today: the residents of California. With a 13.3 percent tax rate on highest earners, Manny Machado will pay the state $39.9M over the next 10 years.
Bryce Harper seems like a long shot for the Chisox then. Little doubt he’s going over 300M now. https://t.co/RKn4sbeOwi
So I got at least one contract prediction right - yes, exactly right. https://t.co/nP5bH7t2WX
Machado — like most free agents — took the best financial deal. Can’t blame him for that. SD isn’t such a bad place, either. (Though most Miamians don’t like to go west of the Everglades.)
Machado’s deal once finalized is the biggest for a free agent in baseball history. But that record may only last a matter of days— if that.
Padres owners are telling people there’s no deal done finalized. But obviously someone thinks it’s done, as the figures have been reported and other interested teams have heard SD is the choice. https://t.co/eqvTAnOARy

One interesting dynamic to the Harper/Machado market: 3 prime teams have shown interest in both stars — the Phillies, Padres and White Sox. Phillies have been confident they’ll land 1 of the stars, but at least 1 of these teams will be shut out.
More defense than I expected at nba all-star game. 95-82 at the half.
While the Phillies have made progress and are seen as the favorite for Harper, especially with the self-proclaimed stupid money, several teams are said to still involved, including both the Giants and Padres.
Perhaps they upped the bid? (High Cali tax and deferrals could factor in as well, tho) #padres https://t.co/mqamaIreJG
Padres aren’t kidding around and are said to have made serious offers for both Machado and Harper. Their bid for Machado is believed to be for about $250M (and about 8 years) tho there is the Cali tax and possibly deferrals. Bid for Harper believed to be for more than that.
As things intensify, Bryce Harper has multiple long-term offers for more than 30M a year. Philly is viewed as the favorite, as said here, but it is also said to an “evolving” market.
Word is Machado will go for the “best deal” (ie most money), but if he’s willing to do something short term — very short term — he should try calling back the Yankees. It’s a long shot, but under those circumstances, word is they might consider Manny.
Following their postseason run and the realization of the obvious fit, Moose’s string preference was to stay in Milwaukee. There’s word he had a multiyear offer elsewhere. Brewers want to maintain infield spot for top prospect Keaton Hiura however.
There was a belief Machado preferred to be east and especially not be on the West Coast. However recent word in Miami circles has been that he’s going to take whatever the best deal is. #padres
Padres remain hopeful to land one of the two big fish (Manny seems more likely, with Harper/Phillies heating up). Chisox plus mystery teams the main competition assuming Phils get their top target.
Moose quickly was beloved in clubhouse and among Milwaukee fans. This was a great fit. Team player that he is, Travis Shaw will move to 2B.
Moustakas deal with brewers will be for $10M and will likely include mutual option @BNightengale on the 10M
Moustakas close to returning to brewers. Said to be about 9M for 1. @Ken_Rosenthal and @JeffPassan 1st. Also had interest from angels or could have possibly waited for a manny runner up (ie padres or chisox).
Harper talks with Phillies appear to be intensifying, but no word anything’s done and to this point it seems other interested teams haven’t been told they are out. That includes Padres, Nats, Giants, Chisox, multiple mystery teams.
Aaron Loup: 1.2M in 2019 with 800K games incentives. 2M option in 2020 with 200K buyout with 800K incentives. So he gets 1.4M on team and maxes out at 4.8M. #padres
Not so “stupid” after all https://t.co/qZrT03ws8E
As things heat up, hear Harper is talking to other teams beyond Philly, and Philly is still talking to both Harper and Machado. Feels like Philly-Harper is the most likely match at this point tho.
Things are heating up with Harper. Intensified is the word I heard. Phillies are the favorite, but word remains that nothing’s done yet. Will be a long-term deal.

Think the #SFGiants are doing well with their opportunistic approach this winter. They’ve enhanced their depth at minimal cost. Big question is how aggressive they will be with Harper, but like what they’re doing so far.

Severino extension will be pending physical @Joelsherman1 1st
Severino and Yankees will have a deal. Expected to be 4 years plus option, about 40M. Arb hearing was postponed to finish agreement.
Heard in Miami circles: It’s about the deal, he’s disappointed with the offers so far and Machado is willing to wait for what he think he’s worth (said to be about $300M). There is some strategy to this, as his market may improve if Harper goes off board first.

MLB players will wear MLB 150 patches this year. That signifies the sport’s anniversary, not the number of free agents remaining.
Have heard reported offer of 250M for 8 yrs for Machado by White Sox isn’t right. May or may not be close, but guess would be that at least today it’s a bit lower. Higher than 175 but lower than 250. At least at moment. (So yes, we still don’t have facts, just educated guesses.)
Despite rumored offers/wishes of teams, word is Bryce Harper is not signing — or even considering — short-term deals.
Brett Anderson is back again with the A’s. It’s a 1 year MLB deal. @susanslusser and @JaneMLB are on it
Verlander speaks from experience. He signed for 28M year and has been worth every penny (and more) https://t.co/fW3P5sVFFM
Machado posted a chisox item (baby shoes) on his Instagram. But I’m not sure how to interpret this. They are No. 17, which is brother in law Yonder Alonso’s number. Plus, Machado followed YES Network weeks ago, and that appears to have been only for fun. https://t.co/TTC6jOmBY5
One clarification regarding Realmuto talks: while Marlins sought two key pieces to headline the package for JT, once the dodgers declined to include Bellinger, Miami wanted 3 big prospects from LA, not just 2 since they were all minor leaguers: Lux plus May plus 1 of Ruiz/Smith

Realmuto’s ask of Marlins — about the Posey deal — likely reflected his reluctance to stay long-term with rebuilding team and doesn’t necessarily mean he’d ask exactly that of the Phillies should they try to sign him long-term.
Realmuto and Marlins were about $100M apart in contract negotiations early this winter. Marlins started at about $60M for 5 yrs plus option (comps for 16M in the 3 free agent years were Martin, McCann deals) while Realmuto camp sought about Posey money (Posey deal was 167M).
Most others in on Realmuto were willing to surrender 1 big piece but not a 2nd big piece. Marlins sought 2 of May, Lux, Ruiz and Smith from LA (after it was clear Bellinger was going nowhere) and 2 of Riley, Pache and a big pitching prospect (ie Wright, Wilson, Anderson) from ATL
In the end, the other teams in on Realmuto offered 1 big piece but not 2. The phillies were the ones that stepped up, adding sixto to Alfaro. And marlins like the 3rd piece, will Stewart, too. Unlike some others, They viewed him as Phils’ top righty prospect.
Realmuto acquisition can’t hurt Phillies’ case for Harper (their top FA target). And Phillies people did recall that Harper was upset his Nats were beaten by JT in a July game after failing to trade for him. Harper then: “If that guy was on our side that wouldn’t have happened.”

while Realmuto wasn’t anxious to do an extension with the rebuilding Marlins, he is generally thought to be open to talking about one. He and Marlins had brief long term contract talks st some point but they were miles apart since a trade was preferred by the player.
Miami preferred not to trade Realmuto within the division, but in the end, it’s not surprising a team that saw him most also appreciated him most
Catching up on credit: @Ken_Rosenthal @jonmorosi @Joelsherman1 @JimBowdenGM @JeffPassan  on Realmuto deal
Baseball great Frank Robinson — a superstar player and a trailblazer— has passed away
Deal agreed to. Stewart and international $ go with Alfaro and Sixto to Miami for Realmuto.

Thanks friends https://t.co/uixshC2iGi
Early word is that the big new proposed rules changes — DH in the NL, 3-batter minimum — are very unlikely to be implemented anytime soon.
Looks like Miami is going to come out well, assuming philly deal is completed. Sixto is very highly regarded, Alfaro is talented, and there will be 1 or 2 more pieces. #Realmuto
Luis Garcia hit .369 in gulf coast league at 17 (he just turned 18) and is a plus defender. Presumably phillies want to hold onto him.
Shortstop Luis Garcia (he is a ss! Not to be confused with the other Luis Garcia) and righty Spencer Howard could be in Realmuto mix
Blevins gets 1.5M plus incentives on a’s deal
Phillies are likely reluctant to include Haseley or Bohm in package with Sixto and Alfaro. Pitchers Luis Garcia and Spencer Howard have also come up as third piece possibilities for a realmuto.
Phillies are in the lead in Realmuto derby. Sixto and Alfaro are agreed upon but working on the rest. Marlins seek Bohm, Haseley, Moniak or Medina. Phillies want to limit the number going south. @jonmorosi and @Joelsherman1 r on top of it

Blue Jays are among teams in on Sergio Romo as he moves close to a deal
Carlos Correa was represented at his winning arb hearing by both GSE and Genske. It isn’t known whether Correa will stay with Genske or hire a new agent.
The Legacy’s baseball division was bought by Gatemore and will operate under GSE (Gatemore Sports and Entertainment). GSE baseball will be led by Peter Greenberg. Greg Genske is no longer with company. The union recently affirmed Genske’s license and he could operate on his own.
Harper and Giants were first linked by @RandyJMiller

@SethBurn Their old school stats are very similar. Since Berkman played the field with close hitting stats I think this is an example of war not being perfect. According to war Lou Whitaker is comparable to Derek jeter. War is imperfect
@panicatciti Lou Whitaker has a comparable war to Derek jeter. That’s a real lol
@AndrewBucholtz There are a lot of similarities. Playing a position, even if you are considered average or slightly below, should carry a value. That someone plays a position but gets a 0 war for it and is thus deemed of equal value defensively to a dh is a flaw in the system.
I agree with Berkman. They had similar lifetime stats. Tho Edgar had a higher ops plus it was close (147 to 144), and Berkman had many more mvp votes, a bigger postseason moment (and a ring) and played the field his whole career (except for his short stay in the Bronx). https://t.co/VGFifWgy8Q

Phillies have made progress in Realmuto talks, as @TBrownYahoo said. But there’s no word anything’s agreed to, and others (reds, dodgers, padres, rays, braves) remain in mix. Mia prefers to trade out of division but philly has good pieces (sixto, Medina, Romero, Alfaro, etc.)
Correa gets 5M (Astros had submitted 4.25), and Pham gets 4.1M (Rays had suggested 3.5). Big win for GSE, which just acquired the Legacy baseball division.
Correa and Pham win arb cases

Hear at least 8 teams are still checking in on Harper, though at least a couple/few of them are likely thinking short-term

Book recommendation: “They Said It Couldn’t Be Done.” Esteemed former Daily News wordsmith Wayne Coffey digs up plenty of great new details to make the story of the Miracle Mets of 1969 seem very fresh. Bravo!
The Reds’ position on 3B prospect Jonathan India, No. 5 overall pick in 2018 draft, is that while they like him very much, he’s behind their big 3 (Senzel, Greene and Trammell). They deny he’s being shopped; he’s only been on table in talks for Kluber, Bauer and now Realmuto.
Padres ownership is said to view Bryce Harper as a business/marketing opportunity and despite the positional need at 3B may now lean toward Harper over Machado (also Manny not want to go west). Question now is whether San Diego could outbid a team with stupid $ (plus others).

#SFGiants are pursuing multiple players and looking to make offers. Looking mostly at position players to fill depth and OF needs. Agents would call them lowball buds, the team might put it this way: they are looking for “opportunities” in a tough market.
Teams still seeking a starter: padres, Chisox, giants, reds, presumably orioles and possibly yankees, mets, phillies.
Here’s how Correa case (5M vs. 4.25M) could turn: Is he more like Baez ($5.2 m), Story ($5 m) or injured Seager ($4M)? If he had not gotren hurt, Correa is arguing Lindor and Betts (mid $10s). Crazy to think he is worth half of those guys, but injuries are big deal in arb.
Carlos Correa arbitration hearing was yesterday but the result is being held until Tuesday, ap reports. Results are sometimes held so as not to affect other upcoming hearings. Could be Tommy Pham in this case.

Folks around the game suspect the Braves are lying in the weeds for superstar closer Craig Kimbrel. Other possibilities include Phillies, Nats, Red Sox, Twins, and of course, a mystery team.
Free agent Bud Norris has switched agencies at an interesting time, less than 2 weeks before spring training. He has hired the Ballengee group.
Rockies are smart to settle with Arenado, who is a free agent after this year. They obvs hope to keep him long-term, tho it’s very hard to see him signing before free agency.
Arenado settles for arb record 26M. He’d asked for 30M, team proposed 24M. Tops Donaldson’s 22M. @Ken_Rosenthal 1st

Wade Miley goes to astros. 4.5M plus 500K incentives
Machado hoped to “top Stanton” (unlikely) and land with Yankees (also unlikely now — tho he had a chance when they met Dec.19), so it’s no surprise there are whispers of dissatisfaction with how this has gone. It appears to be 3 of same teams for him: Chisox, philly and padres.
@BleacherNation I don’t think that will happen
Harper goes into his meeting with Padres higherups tonight with at least 4 teams in realistic play: phillies, nats, chisox and pads. Several other teams are showing interest but most of those are believed interested in shorter term deals.
The A’s are among teams considering Matt Wieters. They pursued Jonathan Lucroy earlier, before he went to the Angels.
Twins great Joe Nathan will suit up and be a celebrity instructor at #MNTwins camp in spring. (Spring training must sound good to Minnesotans today — Minus 12 degrees in Twin Cities at moment)
Zach Neal, who signed with Seibu, will be in their rotation. Salary is up to 850K.
Twins are looking to add a reliever. Ryan Madson, vet who still throws hard, is among considerations.
Reds, Padres, Braves, Rays remain in running for Realmuto. Dodgers not out of it but not as engaged as frontrunning foursome.
Rockies are interested in bringing CarGo back again and are among teams in on him
Harper is meeting with padres brass tomorrow in Las Vegas, as @Ken_Rosenthal reported. Phils, Nats and ChiSox are others known in on BH https://t.co/OTbUiyYSXI

And hello to you my South Florida neighbor https://t.co/RsHMg0PTun

Galvis gets $5M guarantee on jays deal @Feinsand 1st
It seems Reds are pretty adamant about keeping Nick Senzel who’s big-League ready and can play multiple positions (he’s even decent in the OF). However, Reds are well stocked with prospects (Trammell, India, etc.) so they remain in Realmuto hunt.
We’ll see what happens, but give the Padres, ChiSox, Reds and of course Phillies credit for trying to improve and to move forward their target dates to contend. Too many other teams are OK with losing.
While Padres have an eye on Manny Machado, they are also considering Mike Moustakas, who may be a more realistic target. No surprise, Eric Hosmer is said to have highly recommended Moose.
Progress yesterday but Marlins, Reds still apart on prospects that would go to Miami in potential Realmuto deal. Padres trying, with LA still in and logical. Braves, Astros, Rays among other possibilities.
New spot for Kimbrel? https://t.co/g5a9hQRNMm

Shawn Kelley zeroing in on deal with Rangers
Merrifield: 4year- $16.25M guaranteed  +2M in salary escalators +1.6M in potential bonuses.19.85MM achievable in the 4 year guarantee. 5th year option $10.5M with $750k buyout  +1M in salary escalators  +400k in potential bonuses  $11.9M achievable in option year $31.75M possible
Jonathan India, 3B from Coral Springs, Fla. and U of Fla., the 5th overall pick in 2018 draft, is another Reds prospect who may be of interest to the Marlins in Realmuto talks.
Junichi Tazawa: 800K base If in majors with chance to make 2M. #cubs
Reds are making progress. In Realmuto talks, but there’s word of caution: not at finish line yet.
Reds are indeed very much in Realmuto mix. Cincy prospects Hunter Greene, Nick Senzel and Taylor Trammell are thought of interest to Miami, though Reds likely prefer not to include any of those 3. Possibility vet catcher Tucker Barnhart could be included in potential deal as well
Dodgers and Padres have been at the forefront of the Realmuto talks in recent days. However, word now is that a 3rd team — believed to be the Reds — is also making a push.
There’s no no-trade provision in Merrifield deal. However it’s pretty clear how much the #Royals love him. It’s also understandable why a late riser like Merrifield did this deal.
Hunter Strickland: 1.3M base, incentives for games and games finished. Could be #mariners closer. @GregJohnsMLB on it
Magowan was a terrific gentleman, one of the very best https://t.co/cIoqKoWEYl

Realmuto talks are said to be gaining momentum, with the Dodgers and Padres believed most prominent in discussions at moment. LA has the need and the young players to trade (Verdugo, etc.) and is logical. Reds, Braves, Astros among others with interest.
barring Machado falling into their lap (not that likely), the Yankees are just about done. the one thing left on their list is a possible starter to bolster their rotation depth.

A strong case can be made that the three greatest men’s tennis players of alltime are currently playing. Not sure that’s ever happened before in any sport. #roger #rafa #novak
After signing Markakis, Braves have very solid team and no obvious flaws but still have some money to spend. They will be opportunistic, and while they can’t be considered favorites for Kimbrel, Keuchel, Harper or Machado, they haven’t ruled out signing one of the big stars.
Reliever market is popping. Sergio Romo, Shawn Kelley, Ryan Madson are among veteran pen guys who are being heavily pursued.
Best wishes to the great Frank Robinson, who is ailing. Robinson, 83, is the only man to win MVP in both leagues and was the first black manager. When he retired he ranked 4th alltime with 586 HR. He managed into his 70s and currently works as an adviser to Commissioner Manfred.
Great job by #marlins to hire Juan Pierre as outfield instructor. Terrific and very positive link to their championship season of 2003.
Adam Ottavino is official. 8M 2019, 2020, 2021. 3M signing bonus to be paid later. 27M. #yankees

absolutely. Berkman's career was very similar to Edgar Martinez's career (147 ops plus to 144). plus, Berkman played the field, had many more MVP vote totals and helped team win a World Series with key hit. bad job by us! 5% rule needs to go! https://t.co/ClPwdKyS4U

A great comeback story. Two actually. https://t.co/mNCGQ5WVaG
sanmartin actually went from the yankees to the reds. still a good move for yanks to get two top picks. https://t.co/xbqniRvSQJ
Yankees did well to acquire 36th pick in this year’s draft plus OF josh stowers (54th pick last year) plus lefty reiver sanmartin for sonny gray off the year he had. Very smart to deal with the team that sought an extension for sonny.
Sonny Gray flew to Goodyear, Ariz. and was examined by Reds doctor at 7 a.m. in case there was deal. He’s on way home to Nashville a Red w/ 3 more guaranteed years and great friend Derek Johnson his new pitching coach. The locale/security might help him get back to being himself.
Wonderful story: Danny Farquhar is signing a minors deal with Yankees. Farquhar has recovered from life threatening brain hemorrhage suffered early last season while with the White Sox. Great response saved him. Now he is ready to go.
To Amazin’ Mets Fans: Thank u for your support over the years. I am blessed to have shared so many great experiences w/all of u and I am grateful for (the) friendships ... I will cherish them and all of you ... I look forward to meeting my (Dbacks) teammates and fans. — Wilmer F.
Wilmer Flores: 3.75M in 2019, 6M option with 500K buyout in 2020. 250K incentives. 4.25M guarantee. #dbacks
There are no legs to the Pirates rumors today. They are not trading Starling Marte to the Dodgers, and they are NOT the mystery team for Manny Machado (yes, that is apparently an actual twitter rumor).
There are many escalators in Sonny’s new deal, but if Sonny doesn't make any of them (but does get the 4th year option picked up), then the extension total is worth $42.5M over 4. When adding in 2019, that makes if exactly $50M over 5. #reds
Sonny now has 38M guaranteed for 4
Sonny gets additional 30.5M
Sonny gets 3 years added plus 4th year option
Sonny has indeed reached extension agreement with reds
Sonny Gray to Reds is happening @JeffPassan and @Ken_Rosenthal on it

One of best characters in game @MeLlamoTrevor is on #Intentionaltalk now @MLBNetwork #pirates
Rangers have been in contact with Clay Buchholz but there's no word whether any deal is close
No deal done yet but there seems to be some optimism the Reds will be able to extend Sonny Gray and get this long-running trade completed. If not, Yanks may look elsewhere for deal.
With slow moving market, Braves are in good position to fill their corner outfield opening. Markakis, who had big year for them in 2018, remains most logical, but they’ve checked on a Joc Pederson trade, and free agents Adam Jones, CarGo and Parra (and others) are still out there

Here’s why there’s still good reason to believe Reds will get extension w/ Sonny: 1. Reds like Sonny very much 2. Sonny has said players want to play where they’re wanted 3. Reds pitching coach Derek Johnson was Sonny’s coach at Vanderbilt 4. Cincy is close to his Tennessee home.
Gray’s agent Bo McKinnis and Reds don’t have extension yet and have until day’s end Monday to get one done. There’s reason to believe there’s still a very good chance to extend him. But if not, NYY could possibly look at a deal w/SF, OAK, MILW, ATL, etc. or keep him.
@Lynn_Henning Congrats Lynn. I will miss your tweets.
Dodgers, Giants, Angels, Phillies and Rays are among teams in on Josh Harrison, a great and versatile defender
Reds are among about 10 teams that have shown interest in Shawn Kelley, one of the best relievers remaining on market
Cody Allen deal with #LAAngels is official. 8.5M plus 2.5M incentives.
Is this chisox cap a clue, or is Manny trolling us? (Machado also has started following Tim Anderson and Nicky Delmonico on twitter) https://t.co/ob934SvQc3
Reds, Yankees already have agreed on the package going for Gray, believed to include 2B prospect Shed Long and a sandwich pick. But it isn’t known how the package might be reconfigured on the chance Gray says no to the extension offer. Reds r likely confident he’ll say yes tho.
Reds are trying to extend Sonny Gray now, before deal is finalized. Reds know it’s hard to get pitchers to come to Great America but believe Gray, with close connection to new pitching coach Derek Johnson from Vanderbilt, will be receptive. @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned possibility.

All you wanted to know about Shed #yanks #reds https://t.co/xXNB8pfsa7
This could be why NY is buzzing about Nolan Arenado today. Agree with Andy that Yanks likely have an eye on Arenado (but for later, not now) https://t.co/sWvNyPyQpW
Also two of the best guys in the game #Brooklyn https://t.co/m0hmWPyPut
Just to clear up something that’s getting a lot of play in NY today: Yankees and Rockies are not talking about an Arenado trade, and Yankees wouldn’t send Miguel Andujar in package for Arenado. That said, have heard NYY loves Arenado, a free agent after ‘19 (what’s not to love?)
Yankees, Reds are finalizing the Sonny Gray trade. infield prospect Shed Long and a draft pick are expected to go to NY, and possibly a 3rd lesser piece. Long is an excellent hitter, fair defender. Just need to cross t’s, dot i’s (ie medicals, 40-man considerations, etc.)
Phillies have interest in Mike Moustakas. A Move for Moose likely depends on how Machado pursuit works out for them, though.
Brewers have interest in bringing Wade Miley back. Had terrific year for crew. @AdamMcCalvy mentioned
Mets were in on Martin Perez before he agreed to Twins deal. Mets saw him as a depth piece but he was looking to be a rotation piece.
Outfield is a Dodgers priority, and as @Ken_Rosenthal said, they are targeting AJ Pollock. As a right handed hitter who plays center, he fits.
Martin Perez deal with #MNTwins is for about $3.5M. @Ken_Rosenthal 1st on team
Word going around is, #SFGiants have been gauging trade interest in Evan Longoria. Rivals believe it would take big bucks to offset his contract to move him. Has $72.5M to go through 2022 plus $2M assignment bonus if traded (Tampa Bay chipped in $14.5M to trade him last year).
#Reds want to hold catching prospect Tyler Stephenson out of a potential Sonny Gray deal. Now discussions center around 2B prospect Shed Long, a draft choice (sandwich pick) and a 2nd minor leaguer. There’s some optimism but no word it’s done yet.
@BizballMaury Lol. Never!
Yankees and #Reds are getting closer on a Sonny Gray trade. Teams are talking about two prospects and a draft pick going for Sonny. One of 2B prospect Shed Long and C prospect Tyler Stephenson may go. #SFGiants, Braves, Brewers are on periphery. A deal should happen this weekend.
@tjbronxbomber Thank you
Have heard there is indeed a mystery team in Manny derby, and also recently heard that team had the high bid (impression also was that the surprise team wasn’t necessarily his preferred landing spot but maybe $ will decide) https://t.co/Im9JgVyPWQ
Avisail Garcia: 3.5M. Plus 250k for 350 pa, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600. 1M for 650 pa. 6M possible #rays
In Sonny Gray talks, Yankees have shown interest in 2B prospect Shed Long and C prospect Tyler Stephenson from Reds, among others, who have a nice prospect list. A draft pick could also factor into a potential Sonny deal.
Reds, a favorite all along, are still trying for sonny gray, as @Ken_Rosenthal said. Teams are talking about prospects and possibly a draft choice. NYY hoping to complete a deal soon.
Pretty amazing https://t.co/lehEtMyseR
@Adams_Steve What about Nica on 84th near 1st?
Yankees talked concepts with Manny but since the sides were very far apart the only official offer they made was paying his dinner at Ristorante Morini on Madison and 85th (and that was before Tulo and LeMahieu). As for the dodgers, they have not made an offer for him this winter https://t.co/GesvKFxXt6
Not sure why the cubs year after year have to be beholden to the luxury tax threshold. They’ve been great at staying under, so their tax would be pennies. With new TV network they’ll be printing money. And right now, they might be 3rd best in tough division. https://t.co/tiyge3QmMA

@hankschulman I’ll defer to you and the timing hank.
#SFGiants interesting new entrant in Sonny sweepstakes. It does make sense; Giants prez Farhan Zaidi, who knows Sonny from A’s days, is said to be fan. It appears some other linked teams — A’s, Brewers, Braves, M’s, Pads, Reds — don’t appear to be at forefront of talks at moment
Yankees are indeed close to trading Sonny Gray. Teams are also asking about Tommy Kahnle and Jonathan Holder.
Catching up on credit: 1st with news Ottavino was going to yanks were @ByRobertMurray @Ken_Rosenthal and @JeffPassan
Yankees are working hard now on a trade for Sonny Gray. Appears to be getting more serious. Teams involved have included: reds, giants, brewers, a’s, padres, braves, mariners.

Nice story about the bond between Manny Machado, Yonder Alonso and Jon Jay #305 https://t.co/lxrciQ9woX
@MLBBruceLevine No idea what you’re talking about. The agent issued a statement that was pretty clear.
@william_oak2455 @monaco_nick @LastSingleDigit ok im happily blocked
@monaco_nick @LastSingleDigit he blocked me years ago. which is just as well.i don't do well with prisoners. what did it say?
hear that the rumor of a chisox 175M offer for 7 years for manny machado is not correct. am told it is "way off," though not sure exactly how off. I'd say offer has to be higher and almost surely begins with a 2.
phillies, nats and chisox are the only 3 teams known to be in on bryce harper. but fwiw, word is, several teams are said to be waiting in the wings. the word "waiting" suggests this may yet take awhile.
Wilmer Flores will indeed have a deal with the backs, as suggested @JeffPassan 1st said agreement
Mark Rzepczynski’s showcase yesterday went well and was attended by 14 teams #scrabble
wilmer flores is moving closer to a deal. the #dbacks are one of the teams that's been talking to him. @pedrogomezESPN 1st suggested an nl west team could be the leading spot #friends
If Chisox offer to Machado really is 175M, that’s 150M-plus less than asking price. Multiple sources say his agent at different times has asked teams to “top Stanton.” Giancarlo deal was 325M. Quite a gap.
If true Chisox offer to Manny is only 175M for 7 (via @Buster_ESPN), Machado may have erred not making deal with #yankees back on dec. 19 when yanks dined w/MM and NYY was ready to talk turkey. Machado wasn’t talking $ yet but NYY would have paid more than 175. Back then anyway.
Yankees attitude on Manny Machado is that while you never say never, it’s unlikely at this point. They are stacked on infield, and that’s before Didi returns (likely in 2nd half).
While the Yankees are still shopping Sonny Gray, they are also looking around for a starting pitcher. Relief is on their radar as well. Talking to Ottavino, others.
Adrian Gonzalez has a showcase in LA scheduled for Friday
Word is, Harper and Kapler really hit it off during the Las Vegas meeting, which could be another factor in Phillies’ thinking. Easy to see that: both quite intense
Phillies could still go either way on the 2 FA mega stars. But here’s why they may be leaning Harper now: 1) acquisition of ss Segura 2) Harper cachet, success at philly  3) great meeting w/Harper 4) competition for Harper comes from nl east rival nats, who beat phils for Corbin
Regardless who they sign this winter, phillies will make a big play for mike trout in 2 years — provided he hasn’t signed an extension, of course. #LAAngels will try to extend Trout this winter, but while he likes it there, the whispers are that an extension now is unlikely.
Felt like Machado was Phils’ top choice at one time. Now it seems like it’s even or maybe a lean toward Harper. That 4/5 hour, 2 video meeting in Las Vegas sounds like it went great for Harper and the Phillies, who are expected to make offer to him soon, if they haven’t by now.
Philly is in excellent position to sign one or the other of the free agent mega stars — Harper or Machado. Signing both though is said to remain pretty unlikely. But after they secure 1, Phils may take a closer look at other top free agents (ie Keuchel, Kimbrel, Pollock)
Inquiring about the rumor that the Braves were signing Marwin Gonzalez, heard that Atlanta has no offers out to any free agents (including Marwin) and in fact is not currently in talks with any free agents. So I’d guess they are either focusing on trades or waiting out market.
Am hearing Chisox have not changed their number original 7 year offer as of now. @scottmerkin and @BNightengale said this as well but earlier
Great choices. Congrats all! https://t.co/7dQrFcp5gn
this public debate over whether the chisox offer to machado is 7 years or 8 years isn't helping his cause to "top Stanton." of course offers can change, and another team (or 2 or more)) could top CWS bid, but the 7/8 offers being mentioned are surely nowhere near $325M record.
Technically, the Grandal option is a mutual option, not a club option. So more likely to not be exercised since both sides need to agree. More likely just a way to defer a bit of the money.
Avisail: 3.5M guarantee. 2.5M incentives. Pending physical. #rays @Feinsand had the guarantee
Grandal: $16M - 2019. Club option 2020 for $16M or $2.25M buyout. $100,000 for MVP ($75,000-2nd; $50,000-3rd) $50,000 for Comeback Player of the Year $50,000 for All Star $50,000 for Silver Slugger $50,000 for Aaron $25,000 for Gold Glove $25,000 for LCS/MVP $50,000 for WS/MVP
Avisail deal being finalized with rays (should have included the team)
with bonuses, Avisail Garcia will be able to earn about $6M on deal being finalized @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
As expected ... remember, this is mostly procedural, and baseball isn’t out if the picture (yet) https://t.co/jtkSlCDZFk
The A’s are allowed by rules to give Murray an MLB deal for much more than his $4.66M signing bonus if he opts for baseball but Sunday’s meeting, which also included MLB marketing chief Barbara McHugh, only regarded the A’s belief in his baseball potential. No $ were discussed.
QB/CF Kyler Murray is expected by those involved to declare for the NFL draft tonight’s deadline. If he doesn’t, it would be a shocker. Declaring for the draft is really only procedure and allows him to keep his options open. He could still opt to play baseball ultimately.
Mel Stottlemyre, RIP. Excellent pitcher and pitching coach, very nice man.
Derek Holland is signed and official. 6.5M in 2019. 6.5M option in 2020, 500K buyout. 2019 base increases to 7M with 24 games started, 7.5M for 28 gs, 8.5M for 32 gs #sfgiants
Blake Parker signs with Twins. 1.8M. plus 500k for 130 days on the active roster, 400K for 140 days, 250K for 150/160. 3.2M possible.
Belated Congratulations to Collin McHugh and Jake Odorizzi for settling their cases as  both finish undefeated in arbitration (2-0). Who says wins do not matter? (btw Kyle Lohse is also 2-0 and Trevor Bauer has a chance to join the trio if he wins his case.)
Derek Holland returning to the #SFGiants 1 year. 7M. @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
Mark Rzepczynski is holding a showcase for MLB teams tomorrow #scrabble
Things said to “ramp up” in Sonny Gray trade talks since CC Sabathia was given clearance to pitch. At least 6 teams said to be involved. Reds are one. Padres, Brewers, A’s, Padres, Mariners, Braves among others linked to Sonny.
Another great hire by Cubs. Craig Breslow was named director of strategic initiatives.
Barbara McHugh, MLB marketing chief, joined top A’s execs Billy Beane and David Forst in Dallas for meeting with Kyler Murray in attempt to get him to play baseball. Murray has to file for the NFL draft by 12 tonight. @susanslusser 1st reported involvement of a marketing exec.

Andy Murray stays alive! To the 4th set. (Worth getting up at 4:30 for) #AustralianOpen2019
Murray has put himself in fantastic position. One way the A’s can convince him to keep playing baseball, of course, would be to give him another deal. (ie money)
Top A’s execs are in Dallas meeting with Kyler Murray to try to convince him to stick with baseball. The Heisman trophy winner has until tomorrow to declare for NFL draft. Oakland gave him 4.6M bonus after making him a 1st rounder in MLB draft. Scouts love his bat and foot speed.

Nola 6.75, Phillies $4.5 m, $ 5.625 midpoint — Severino $5.25 m, Yankees $4.4 m. $4.825 m midpoint.
Carlos Correa asked for $5M, Astros submitted $4.25M. $4.625 is midpoint.
Sonny Gray settled st $7.5M. Important for the reds and other potentially interested teams to know. #yankees #reds #others

@hiphopguru8282 Who
Machado camp is telling some folks there’s a mystery team in addition to Chisox, Phils. Validity is unknown.
This is rude and not true. Also not especially funny https://t.co/uAsP5cvVt4
Good call by Betances https://t.co/OscyJqEnDH
Dellin Betances is going to settle with yankees this time. #yankees
Amazingly there’s been a 4.35M ceiling since Dontrelle for first year arb starters (excepting Keuchel, who’d won Cy Young). Would benefit players/union if Nola/Severino went to hearing and topped that. The 2 teams could try to prevent that with 2 year deals though.
Nolan Arenado and Rockies don’t have a deal yet. Performance suggests he tops Donaldson’s 23M arb record. Hard to imagine team taking superstar to a hearing, not if they want to enhance (probably slim) chances to re-sign him before free agency next winter.
Good story. Great guy. https://t.co/CTxZxU7kYg
Young aces Severino and Nola don’t have deals yet. Could go to trials.
Javier Baez settles at 5.2M #cubs
DeGrom 17M deal is a record raise in arbitration and record for 3rd time arb eligible pitcher #mets
DeGrom 17M
Dodgers get Russell Martin, ex dodger who’s returning. Dodgers are still in on realmuto.
DJ LeMahieu was originally drafted into the cubs organization when current yankees exec Jim Hendry was cubs gm
Khris Davis 16.5M settled
Realmuto 5.9M settlement
yanks execs were always said to be "mixed" on machado. hard to go to 300M, or even close, if you are sorta enthusiastic.
Thor gets $6M #mets
With LeMahieu, Torres, Tulo and Andujar (plus whoever plays 1B), the yankees have an extra infielder as is. chisox, philly chances improve further on Manny.
LeMahieu $24M, 2-year deal makes Manny even more unlikely for yanks. will be a major surprise if anyone but white sox or Phillies get Manny now.
LeMahieu indeed has a deal with the yankees. 2 years.
Yanks talking to a LeMahieu as @JackCurryYES reported. Would seem to close door Manny for them.
Mookie Betts’ 20M settlement is a record for a player in his 2nd year of arbitration
Mookie obvs! 20M!
Moose Betts has 20M settlement with Red Sox
yes, yes, yes! https://t.co/3jEwvcSVkY

personal news: I am returning for a 12th year at @WFAN660. happy to be back with Joe and @EvanRobertsWFAN. will be on tomorrow. (hopefully Joe can recover from jets coaching news)
Reds still among teams with interest in Sonny Gray. He has close connection with Reds pitching coach Derek Johnson. Yankees believed interested in multiple pitching prospects -- good ones in the category of Santillan, Gutierrez and Mella. upper level guys with a chance.
Dodgers have looked at LeMahieu, and have interest. But they could also give Taylor and/or Kike' a shot. Austin Barnes can also play 2B.
With recent run on 2B, LeMahieu is drawing interest. Rays, #SFGiants among interested teams. #Brewers, Dodgers, others could also fit. excellent defender. @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned SF.
Wilmer Flores is drawing interest from several teams. Kills lefties. But here’s a surprising stat. Most walkoffs since 2014: Flores 10, Donaldson 7, Pujols 6, Harper 6, Trumbo 5.
@KeithOlbermann You seem very angry
Lowrie is a great fit for Mets since they may need help at 1B and 3B and he can also spell Rosario at SS. Switch hitter whose best two offensive seasons were his last two. Mets are having among best winters in baseball.
Lowrie Mets deal is for precisely $20M over 2 years
Lowrie gets in the 20M range on mets deal. Mets showing they are willing to spend.
Sources: Mers agree to two-year deal with Jed Lowrie.
Agree https://t.co/s5IlqZ8qCt
Chisox continue to try hard on Manny Machado. Not a surprise following the pickups they’ve already made. Appear to have at least given themselves a real chance.
On MLBNow now @MLBNetwork
Very sad to hear. Rick was a gem. was hitting coach for yanks, mets, dodgers, red sox, angels and orioles. terrific guy. dodgers should have hired him to manage at one point. https://t.co/PLLgy0YNAR
Some $ are deferred in Dozier deal, as Nats are wont to do. No incentives. @Ken_Rosenthal and @JeffPassan 1st on main info

Grandal agrees to Brewers deal. @Ken_Rosenthal reports it’s for 1 year.
Can’t confirm Yankees are out (there’s no word they’ve been told this at least), but as said, they haven’t engaged in negotiations lately or made an official offer. They aren’t meeting the believed 325M-plus target, or even 300. Or even coming especially close. https://t.co/pTjdkPLjSP

Rangers agree to deal with Shelby Miller @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
More specifically, Machado camp still believed seeking something “north of Stanton.” (325M plus). Great player, very young for a free agent (26) and doesn’t hurt to ask. Still, very hard to see him getting there (or even close) on non-deferred, true-value deal at this point.
@jt_teran @GMBVW Slim
Word is, Machado camp still seeking 300M plus. ChiSox, Phillies not believed to be close to that ask (though exact current offers aren’t known, and can change). Meanwhile, Yanks, believed to be preferred destination, have yet to make official offer. Still no word of mystery team.
Congrats Pete. Looks tasty https://t.co/qNKlh88DU4
Mets did make an offer to Grandal as the LA Times reported, but official bid is believed to have been for less than the 60M first suggested. Love Ramos though so set at catcher now.
Mets are among teams to have talks regarding Brian Dozier lately, tho Nats, Rox and others seem like more logical fits. Market for him starting to warm.
Phillies already have had a very productive winter (Cutch, Segura, Robertson, etc.). But considering expectations, some fans will be disappointed if there isn’t more to come. And in some cases, perhaps if they don’t start spending stupid money.
Sources: Phillies contingent is making the trek to Las Vegas this coming weekend to visit with Bryce Harper. They are still among known trio on Machado as well. Signing both hasn’t been ruled out but seen as unlikely. If get neither, will re-evaluate (Keuchel? Kimbrel? Pollock?)
Good news for CC. He underwent a follow up stress test today, and has been cleared to begin working out, team announces. #yankees
Another who went the clean route. Admirable. https://t.co/4vi5dIy48R

@VinceSamperio Thanks for your unbiased opinion from scully avenue
@MWHagans79 Albies is not a crazy ask imo either tho I understand atl not doing it too
@maseifried They didn’t get them either
Folks have complained Marlins ask is too high for Realmuto. But 2 uninvolved execs point out he’s game’s best catcher; say they’d even give up Bellinger for him. Get why LA prefers to keep Bellinger and why prospects make sense for Miami but Bellinger not a crazy request.
Catching up on credit: @JeffPassan and @TBrownYahoo 1st on some Btitton details @BNightengale 1st on chisox offer to manny
@Feinsand @enosarris If britton opts out after two that means he has another big deal waiting for him. Opting out means he knows he will do better than 39/3 guarantee, possibly much better. Britton may get 53 on this deal — 30M more. Robertson did well for a player but not worth the meager savings
@JonnyDubs88 lol
@enosarris agree. 16M more. player opt out. chance for 30M more. assignment bonus. but he saved 1.15M!
Gil Hodges should be in the hall of fame for his amazing baseball life https://t.co/mQnVSZEone
Deal agreed to. Britton guarantee is 39M for 3. Can opt out after 26 and 2 years. And yanks can “opt in” at that time to make the 4 snd 53. #yankees
Britton deal can reach 53M for 4 years
Britton opt-out will be after two years. Once finalized, Yankees will likely have an “opt in” after two that could extend deal to four. But as said, 3 years is the guarantee.
Even with Yankees about to add Britton (finalizing) they are continuing to pursue Ottavino @Ken_Rosenthal 1st on Britton being close
Yanks are close to a Britton deal. Will be 3 guaranteed but include opt out for Britton and opt in for Yankees that could make it 4 years.
Tulo gets full no-trade with Yankees along with 555K minimum salary (from them). 16 teams were interested following his workout so he had leverage. Original trade from Rockies upset him as he had belief he’d have a say in trade (he didn’t); now he has control over that
Rymer Liriano: 600K in majors, outs for Japan, Korea, camp invite (majors) #mets
Francisco Pena will make 675K if in majors #STLCards
Rangers are a semi surprise entry at the top of the bullpen market. They are considering at least Adam Ottavino and Zach Britton and could be a legit challenge to yanks and others linked to those 2 pen stars.
Things are starting to heat up for Brian Dozier. Great bounce back candidate. Gold glove a year ago, 40-plus HR in 2016.
Yankees are working on pen as they await word on Machado. Chisox and Phillies also waiting. No team is believed at 300M. If all are in 200-250 range and that’s possible (perhaps philly is a little higher, tho that is unknown), fwiw most around game still believe Machado picks NYY
Met acquire Keon Broxton
Yankees sign Billy Burns. Minor league deal.
Well this settles it https://t.co/lXV53unA1h
Goin on #MLBNow with @MrBrianKenny @TheDaveSimsShow and Dan O’Dowd talkin Phils, Mariners, other stuff @MLBNetwork
phillies are in process of setting up a face to face meeting with bryce harper, as @JSalisburyNBCS 1st reported. rival nats are obviously interested in retaining harper. chisox seem like a long shot for harper at moment, but mystery team(s) always possible.
Mike Napoli was a candidate for a cubs coaching job, and even interviewed with the team before their recent hires. but ultimately, after retiring just a few weeks ago, he doesn't mind having a little time off. would make a great coach somewhere when ready.
Agree on Robertson. And Philly got him for reasonable money, not at all stupid money. Remember Miller off injury year got vesting option. Phils got Robertson on 3rd year team option. https://t.co/KLSIPWTH4X
@Rush95_ Thank you

Phils have acquired mccutchen, segura and robertson so far. not bad at all! focus now is mostly on machado/harper. they have yet to spend stupid money. trying.
Robertson: $10M 2019. $11M 2020. Club option 2021 for $12M or $2M buyout. Plus: 50K for All Star, Gold Glove, LCS/MVP, Silver Slugger (unlikely), 100K for WS MVP, Cy Young (50K 2nd; 25K-3rd) Player donates 1% of salary to club charity. (nice touch). @Feinsand first with $. #phils
“Saved.” Very likely cost himself much more than that. He is a smart guy but not a trained agent. And he probably understands this isn’t a do-it-yourself project. Last time, with a qualifying offer (and an agent), he got exactly twice as much. https://t.co/kg4mkH6vx7
yankees seem focused on Zach Britton for the pen. he is believed to have multiple offers. but nyy wants to bring him back.

Incumbent Nats shouldn’t be counted out of Harper derby. Of course they shouldn’t. Club owner Ted Lerner fairly recently met with Harper (sometime after the winter meetings). It is thought to have been a good meeting, too, fwiw. @chelsea_janes 1st mentioned meeting

‘’Twas a bad holiday for Machado’s leverage with Ysnkees: first he follows (then quickly unfollows) YES Network on instagram, now Yanks sign the only other free agent shortstop with as many (or more) all-star selections, mvp votes and gold gloves as him. #Tulo
Tulo is said to have looked very good at workout. He always wanted to be a Yankee, and tried to get there years before. Deal gives NYY another possible SS option, and also can’t hurt their leverage with Manny Machado, who also is believed to prefer Yanks, all things being equal.
Tulo does indeed have a deal for the minimum pay for 2019 with the Yankees @JeffPassan 1st

everything you always wanted to know about Kikuchi but were afraid to ask #mariners https://t.co/hbawu7sIkA
Kikuchi: 4 years guaranteed. 14M year aav. Opt out after 3 years at 43M. club can extend to 109M/7. If club doesn’t elect on 4 year extension at 16.5M per player has option for additional year at 13M. #mariners
Kikuchi has an unusual deal. Has initial 4 year guarantee (3 years plus 2022 player option) but 4th year player option can be replaced by an additional 4 year guarantee for a total of 7 years by the #Mariners
No doubt @coachfitz51 is the best! #GoCats! https://t.co/8JNPrfHM9d
Fwiw (maybe not much), Manny Machado has now unfollowed Yes Network on instagram. Doesn’t want to lose leverage with Yankees? Changed his mind? Or just having fun? #yanks #phils #chisox
Sources: Yusei Kikuchi has a deal with Mariners
Deadline for Kikuchi signing is Wednesday at 5 pm. So actually 40 hours away. But still heading toward finish. #mariners working on it.
Mariners are among teams to make big play for Kikuchi. They are serious bidders but others are still involved and deal isn’t finalized with them yet. Deadline for deal is in less than 20 hours. @TBrownYahoo 1st mentioned M’s are progressing.
@TKREFRESH22 thanks for the pep talk tom. happy new year to you too!

Just to put this into context, I was ONLY answering a question about which of THESE 2 big market teams that may be lurking — dodgers or cubs — is more likely to sign harper. I suggested maybe cubs more likely than LA mostly based on the 2 teams’ recent history w/ big free agents https://t.co/Q1WLpqBrGZ

regarding yesterday's blockbuster, loved that the reds made their team much more exciting and interesting. with their 2nd proven starting pitcher added (Alex wood and tanner roark), their rotation is much improved, too.
Graveman's agreement with the cubs is for an MLB deal
first to link graveman and the cubs was @ESPNChiCubs
A’s are close to re-signing Mike Fiers. @jonmorosi 1st
Kendall Graveman is going to the Cubs. Good bounce back candidate.

Dodgers are saving about $14M for CBT purposes. So that opens some possibilities. (Side note: dodgers originally gave Kemp 160M contract but oddly enough have now made 3 good trades involving him since, all to save $/payroll space, 1 where he returned, 2 where he left)

One NL scout on new Dodger prospect: “Jeter Downs a stud....don’t care what he is ranked...future all-star.”
with big savings for 2019, dodgers can take closer look at big tickets like Corey Kluber/Trevor Bauer (if Tribe does trade 1 of them) and yes, possibly Bryce Harper. JT Realmuto is another star they've been talking about.
have heard only good things about new dodgers infield prospect Jeter Downs, and it's more than just the name. Can hit.
complete trade: kemp, Puig, wood, farmer and 7M for Bailey, gray and downs
Kyle Farmer also in trade to reds
Trade is puig, kemp, wood and at least another player(s) plus cash for bailey, Gray and downs
Reds will receive $ in trade
As @JeffPassan 1st reported reds and dodgers have a big deal. Kemp, puig, wood and homer bailey all have been extensively discussed for weeks between these two teams
Puig is in trade and will go to reds
Manny Machado has conveyed to the three known interested teams — White Sox, Yankees and Phillies — that his decision will come after the new year.

Descalso deal with cubs for $5M over two years is done and official. Announcement coming. They very much liked La Stella but see Descalso as added power and defense. @Ken_Rosenthal had the figure 1st
Phillies met with agent scott boras regarding bryce harper at gm and winter meetings, and manny machado will travel to meet with Phillies Thursday. they and chisox are the 2 teams known to be interested in both mega stars. though the chances of 1 team signing both seems remote.
Lance Lynn: $4,000,000 signing bonus, $8,000,000 in 2019, $10,000,000 in 2020, $8,000,000 in 2021. awards bonuses.  Plus: $100,000 if traded to LAA, LAD, AZ, CO, SD, OAK, SF SEA. (One time). #rangers

What’s the deal with the Bryce and Manny markets? Takin a look at chisox, phils, yanks, dodgers and “others” https://t.co/fHJ7yvg4Ma
mets have accomplished 4 of their main goals, with only CF and a lefty reliever to go. CF is their next target. they like pollock but are said to have a couple mystery options, as well
mets met with both Ramos (at winter meetings) and Grandal (before Winter Meetings) and decided they liked Ramos' bat -- and also 2 years (Grandal obviously seeks more) and no draft choice/int'l $ attachment
#mets would have had to give up at least 1 of rosario, conform and nimmo in a package with prospects for Realmuto and decided they would prefer not to create a hole(s)
Hear Mets were Ramos’ 1st choice. Has now played with 3 NL East teams. $19M for 2 seems like good deal fir him, too. Making up for one of the worst timed injuries ever a few years back.
Mets ultimately decided they didn’t want to create another hole (ie SS, OF)  so out on Realmuto @DaniAlvarez_16 1st with agreement
Ramos gets 19M
Mets are said to be out of Realmuto derby after Ramos agreement
Wilson Ramos agrees to mets deal, pending physical
@SCasten17 @Phillies @whitesox No
Phillies also have decent chance on Machado. They are obviously serious, and he knows and likes the phillies execs he knew from the orioles (MacPhail, Klentak,  etc.)
@Ksmizzle219 Phils have good chance
@ToHomePlate Philly has a decent chance I just don’t know when that meeting is
@bergerharry Not at all
@KareemRon33 Not to him. Your opinion isn’t relevant
@von_tann Could be
@MyRickIsLong He likes it tho. It’s not your choice
@ryanjacoblyle Better pizza! But manny likes ny better
@Behavioristt No didn’t say that just don’t know when their meeting is
@jimmybycicle Nope
@John_Ranieri Phils have a real chance
Machado also expected to meet with chisox next week, likely early in week. At least philly is in too. In a yanks vs chisox battle, here are the edges: yanks: team, tradition, location, position (SS vs likely 3B for chisox); chisox: $, years, brother in law.
Machado meeting with Yanks scheduled for Wednesday as @GeorgeAKingIII said. Exact timing may be dependent on funeral arrangements for Joan Steinbrenner, mother of Yankees managing partner Hal. RIP.

Due to bad typing on my I phone while sending to my editor ( believable, right!) my notes incorrectly had a one liner that they mets are interested in Nelson Cruz. That should have been in the Astros notes. Houston had interest in Cruz. The mets are looking at C and CF, not 1B

Quietly, the Indians have had a terrific offseason. Have saved enough $ with deals of Edwin, yonder and yan that they can keep kluber and Bauer, brought back Carlos Santana who they loved and got a major bargain with 37.5M, 3-year Cookie deal
@Britt_Ghiroli Somehow I don’t think that would be quite as embarrassing :)
After trading Edwin, Yonder and Gomes, word is Indians won’t be as “motivated” by financial concerns now. Translation: Kluber and Bauer more likely to stay.

Cubs are one of the teams that has at least been in contact with Tulo, and they will send a scout to a workout. There are others though, so they aren’t necessarily the favorite. His agent told @susanslusser there are 6 teams and they will narrow field soon.

@Ry_Bass Thanks friend
@EvanRomano I’m sorry I really don’t care what else he may have done. I know him to be intractable and quite nasty when it comes to his baseball opinions.
@Crawford_MILB That’s a very fair opinion. I wouldn’t call it networking though in this case. At least not by baines. He’s never said two words at s time. I’m being picky but I’d say favoritism is closer. Anyway your major point is very fair
@KeithOlbermann Lol. Understand your point. But you know jack is honest. There are plenty of guys he doesn’t think belong who are considered borderline. yes he’s in a tough position to go on the record about those players and wouldn’t do it. But He truly saw baines as a hall of famer.
@AdamtheBullFAN Why would you accuse them of being biased? They are not personal friends of baines. And both told me players they aren’t so sure about to make the positive point about baines.
Scott is a very wise and kind person. The piling on of Baines is unfair and rude and frankly reflects poorly on those doing it https://t.co/sdAvLZbikB
This guy once wrote 3,000 words about why I was an idiot for not thinking Hanley should be mvp 1 year. His reasoning: it had to be Hanley, he had the best VORP! If he read this he’d know I didn’t vote for Baines, I just think the destroying of Baines is unwarranted and rude https://t.co/fo5gBBKGOk

Rays, reportedly Rangers among several teams hopeful on Charlie Morton, the 2017 World Series hero who transformed his career last couple years in Houston.
Great causes @JRFoundation and Negro Leagues Museum https://t.co/Zz4o0iFzVO
Mets inquired on Andrew McCutchen before he went to Philly. Weren’t going to be in the 50M ballpark, however.
Mets haven’t given up on Realmuto but haven’t made progress on that front last 24 hours and are looking into alternative plans at the moment. Preference at catcher is to get a strong defender.
Yankees are making strong progress on JA Happ deal. @Ken_Rosenthal reported it’s agreed to.
Catching up on credit: @jcrasnick 1st said Chris Hermann was going to Oakland
Mets are to lose a bit of confidence in realmuto talks, and are starting to think about the value of acquiring a defensive catcher — they met on Maldonado Tuesday — and bulking up the bullpen instead.
The holdup with the dodgers on realmuto has been their unwillingness to include Cody Bellinger.
To this point, the mets have seemed to be the most aggressive team on realmuto. The braves and yankees are in (though the yankees might just be to flip him elsewhere). The phillies, astros, padres and dodgers are in the next tier.
Jordan Lyles will get $2.05M on Pirates deal #bucs #bucks @Joelsherman1 1st linked pirates to Lyles
Wilson Ramos has met with the Brewers, A’s and Mets while in Las Vegas, but he’s still here so there could be more meetings
Rays, Twins, Chisox and a couple others (Astros were linked earlier) are in on Nelson Cruz, who leads MLB with 338 HR over last decade and is the only player with at least 35 HR each of the last 5 years.
Impression from a rival about the Dodgers: “Any of their guys are in play except Buehler and Bellinger.” (My add: we’ll assume Kershaw, Turner, Seager and Jansen probably aren’t going anywhere either).
#STLCards and #Phillies are among several teams pursuing Zach Britton @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned Philly earlier. And their execs all know Britton from time in Baltimore together.
Brandon Hyde was offered the Orioles managing job @Joelsherman1 and @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
Eight teams have shown interest in Wilmer Flores. Rakes vs. lefties. #Friends
Rockies indeed are looking at first basemen. Santana, Abreu, Encarnacion, Myers available. All would hit a lot of homers at Coors. Myers has a lot of $ left (too much, I hear). @JimBowdenGM on the case
Catching up on credit: @Joelsherman1 1st to link Lyles and pirates, @Ken_Rosenthal 1st on reds-dodgers talks
Dodgers and Reds are discussing deals, some of which include Yasiel Puig. If it happens Puig would be reunited with hitting coach Turner Ward for more kisses. #puigyourfriend
Wisdom plus wisdom https://t.co/I2yTHmCXCc
Danny Santana, Inf-Of previously with twins and braves, agreed to minors deal with rangers
McCutchen option for 2022 is 15M with $3M buyout #phillies
Carlos Asuaje is drawing interest from Japan. But for today Rangers, who just claimed him, hold his rights. Texas would likely need to be paid to release him to Japan.
Mets met with Wilson Ramos, who’s here in Vegas, today. Realmuto remains top catching option but Ramos of interest.
Brantley is out as a Phillies option since McCutchen deal, but door is still open for Harper (and of course Machado)
Adrian Gonzalez is willing to hit or work out for any interested team. @BNightengale first mentioned interest in return
Billy Hamilton: 4M in 2019, 7.5M club option in 2020 (1M buyout). Plus 1M incentives. 5M total guarantee. #royals
Corbin deferral devalued contract by tiny amount, about 500K. Union appraisal of deal: $139,433,962 #nats
Patrick Corbin: 2.5M signing bonus, 12.5m in 2019, 19M in 2020, 24M in 2021, 23M in 2022, 24m in 2023, 35M in 2024 (10M deferred w/o interest). 140m total. #nats
Chris Herrmann signs with A’s. $1M plus incentives.
Yanks, White Sox and Phillies are 3 teams that will meet with Manny Machado. The 3 alleged mystery teams remain so.
McCutchen’s deal was healthy at 50M but I wouldn’t consider that stupid money. Still time this winter however to make good on that promise. #philly
Chisox, Braves, Phillies have been 3 of the teams on Michael Brantley. With Cutch in fold with Phils, and Harper still possible there, philly would seem less likely for now.
Mets said “very aggressive” on Realmuto. Debate in room now about whether to give up coveted SS Rosario in package or top SP Syndergaard. Mets didn’t want to open SS hole but that hasn’t been ruled out. Plus, while NYY thing is less a hurdle now, 3 way deals are still complicated
Tulo released, Jays announce. 34M, 2 years to go.
McCutchen deal also includes club option. @MattGelb 1st with the signing.
Cutch gets 50M for 3
Phils, Andrew McCutchen are in agreement on deal
Jordan Lyles agrees to pirates deal pending physical
Being told Folty, Inciarte and Swanson are all “staying put.” At least that’s the plan. Braves are looking to add, not subtract, off their nice year. #braves
Pirates got Yordi Rosario in Nova deal. Plus 500K in int’l $
Rockies and Rangers were teams looking to get in on Realmuto but fit isn’t perfect. They are behind mets, yanks, phils, braves, dodgers, padres, etc.)
Angels, Dodgers, A’s and Rockies among others (along with Mets) looking to upgrade catching situation. Plus the other teams in on Realmuto Will consider (Phillies, Astros, Braves).
Mets like both Conforto and Nimmo but Conforto appears to be the more untouchable of the two
Mets are “kicking tires” on AJ Pollock but would need complement for Lagares if they don’t get him. Concerned about Juan’s ability to maintain health
Realmuto is the clear top catching target for mets but backup backstop plans include Ramos, Grandal and Maldonado
Mets are discussing many exciting things but nothing ultra big seems close at moment. Lots of balls in air but word at this second is: “impossible to describe anything as promising”
@martinonyc Reason banks too I’m sure
Orioles are looking for a SS (and other things). Manager the priority at moment though
Pirates to get young pitcher and international slot $ for Nova. Dealt from rotation strength.
White Sox acquire Ivan Nova @ByRobertMurray 1st
Mets are working both angles to get Realmuto, straight with Miami or via the Yankees (with Noah going). What’s unclear is which scenario, if either, is likely. What’s clear is how much Mets want Realmuto.
Good primer on the ins and outs of potential Syndergaard-realmuto blockbuster (with lots of thoughts about how the executive personalities/relationships) could affect a deal https://t.co/fDOVEe7GxA
Can’t top this. I only had 12K steps Monday.  A rout! Wondering if this competitive nut (I mean “great guy”) has found a way to rig his phone? https://t.co/NDkNpTtVPc
Congrats to Josh Rawiitch of the D-Backs, this years Bob Fishel award (for public relations) winner. Well deserved!
Rockies would love to lock up superstar Arenado but there’s little impetus for a deal now on his part. Nothing to do with Harper/Machado but no reason for him to rush into anything. Folks involved see quick mega extension as highly unlikely/improbable.
Mets weren’t anxious to trade Walker or Duda to the Yankees as rentals (and ultimately didn’t do it). Would be quite a sea change if they’d send Syndergaard to Mets (with 3 years of control!).
Pedro Martinez on Thor (and his feeling about trading him after Thor-Realmuto reports surfaced): “He’s got what it takes. He could be the best.”
Tom Gordon was a finalist for mets bullpen job. He’s available for hire and will be great wherever he lands. A winner. @Joelsherman1 mentioned 1st
Adam Jones, looking for a job for the first time, was spotted here in Las Vegas. Good for any clubhouse. Hoping to play 4-5 more years.
Dodgers have a plethora of good outfielders, and Bellinger is the one most coveted. But of course he’s the 1 Dodgers most want to keep. Puig, Peterson, Taylor, even Verdugo more available. Dodgers. match up well with both marlins and indians.
Fair point from Florida. Fish need to get something great if giving up best catcher in game. https://t.co/xLWHWzUn28
More on potential seemingly fanciful NY-NY blockbuster https://t.co/q6WTG0nQp3
There has indeed at least been talk of 3-way where Realmuto goes to Mets, Syndergaard to yanks. Not sure how likely this is. Seems like quite a gamble  for mets — though there are more star rotation options out there than star catching options.
This explains how the yankees are one of seven teams most involved in Realmuto talks. As suggested, they’d be conduit. Syndergaard-Realmuto would be quite a blockbuster, and quite a switch in mets thinking if they were to agree to a deal where a star of theirs goes crosstown. https://t.co/XzR2x200be
Bryce Harper Las Vegas rundown: He’s met with several teams here off site in his hometown. And has a few more to go. Also, a “mystery owner” has flown in to visit with him.
Yankees do like Gary Sanchez very much, as they’ve said, so not sure how Realmuto deal would work for them. It’s been suggested Yankees involvement could be 3-way situation with them being the conduit.
As of this moment the teams with the best chance to land Realmuto are these 7 — dodgers, mets, padres, astros, phillies, yankees and braves. A couple notably deny being too involved but they are all apparently involved enough to be in the top 7.
Yankees are pursuing Machado but they have other infield options — Marwin Gonzalez, Josh Harrison and possibly even Scooter Gennett to name 3
Hamilton deal with Royals is agreed to
Second this. While I didn’t vote for Baines, he had 2,800 plus hits, 1,600 plus RBI, played every day, made 6 All-Star teams. Fantastic career. https://t.co/FFUGEFqcor
Justin Masterson is retired and doing missionary work, agent Randy Rowley said
Sources: Orioles 6th managerial candidate is Manny Acta, former Nationals/Indians manager
Braves are an under the radar team on J.A. Happ. Uncertain of their chances but they appear to be still in a field that’s been narrowed from a dozen or more.
Kimbrel at least initially was said to be seeeking 6 years, meaning sides were at least 2 years apart https://t.co/UxOCE4dPAm
Heard Yankees, Reds had a little talk on Scooter Gennett. Not sure how much there is to it. NYY does need a middle infielder. Machado, Marwin, Harrison others on their radar.
Reds have gauged interest in Scooter Gennett. However a 2B market that’s flush with 2B may mean the timing isn’t great.
Alex Verdugo is a very good talent but the Dodgers seem willing to include him in a big deal, surely Realmuto and probably Kluber or Bauer. Verdugo would fit the Marlins or Indians, who both need an OF
Brewers have financial constraints. Would like a starting pitcher and to figure out 2B.
Tyson Ross: 5.75M plus 100K if on opening roster, 100K if on May 1 roster, 100K if on June 1 roster. #tigers
Tyson Ross gets $5.75M plus easy bonuses to take him to $6M on tigers deal @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
Nats even after signing Patrick Corbin are looking to add another starter. Wish list: 1 SP, 1 RP, 2B
#MNTwins are a new team in the mix for Nelson Cruz. The Goldy trade may have helped clarify things. Astros, Rays also in. White Sox possibly.
There’s been a sighting of a serious free agent here in Las Vegas. Wilson Ramos is on the premises. Great hitter, terrific guy.
Colby Rasmus is “done and enjoying life,” says a friend. So consider him retired.
This outsized anger over Baines making Hall is silly. Someone wrote that McGwire was “a hundred times better hitter than Baines was, steroids or not.” Me: how do you know? McGwire went from Buhner to Babe in his 30s by cheating. I didn’t vote for Baines but he’s more deserving.
D-Backs could have a couple more pieces to trade. Nick Ahmed is one who could draw interest.
David Robertson, who is serving as his own agent, says he is helping family after his brother in law recently had a baby and won’t make it to Las Vegas. He said he will handle negotiations by phone.
Randy Levine on the rumors: “No one’s talked to me about being White House chief of staff. I respect the president, but I’m very happy being president of the Yankees.”
Braves are also one of many to have checked in on Happ and a trade for Indians starters Kluber and Bauer. Keuchel is on their radar and they’d love him, though they are not currently engaged with him as they are value hunting and presumably figure he will cost (and take awhile).
KC, Billy Hamilton have agreed on base pay and are finalizing deal with performance bonuses. Expected to be close to 5M total. Royals need speed in center.
Funny that Marlins have said they’d prefer to trade Realmuto out of the division, and they just can’t chase those teams out. They know him best. Mets and Phils r involved, Braves not completely out. Nats, who chased hardest over last year, are the 1 nl east team not in.
Braves, Reds and the Phillies are three prime teams on Keuchel. But what if Yankees lose out on Happ. Might they pounce?
Nats are looking closely at 2B. LeMahieu, Marwin, Harrison all in play.
Royals are working toward an agreement with Billy Hamilton. @Ken_Rosenthal 1st
Manny Machado was reputed to have three mystery teams interested (beyond known yankees, phils, chisox), and he may well have. But no one seems to know who they are (that’s why they are a mystery?!) there are skeptics. One exec opined: “He’ll get paid but the market is limited.”
Joel Sherman and I discovered our phones track the number of steps we take daily. The slightly competitive @Joelsherman1 noted multiple times (and I mean like 15 times) that the only reason I won winter meetings day one, 24K to 19k, is that he was on plane 6 hours.
JP Ricciardi may not officially be a SFGiant front office employee but he’s here working with/for them. So we can assume he is one. Former Jays GM, mets exec.
Greinke’s 15-team no-trade list is seen as major impediment to deal. Greinke smartly included Phils, cards, dodgers - almost any big-market team. 2 teams that have shown interest in past not on are HOU and WASH, tho nats already got Corbin. Hou talked ZG last year. @ZHBuchanan
Miguel Montero, who earlier told @nickpiecoro “I’m pretty much retired,” as a player, just now upgraded that to “I’m done,” adding that he hasn’t been training. Montero is at Vegas building his agent business ZT Sports.
Group of baseball connected people celebrates Chanukah in the lobby of the Las Vegas hotel where the winter meetings are being held. That’s Michael Jackson hovering over them. https://t.co/H0SdWrczfn
Braves seem to have Keuchel atop their wish list. Seek 1 starter, 1 reliever and 1 outfielder.
Boras on Kyler Murray: We negotiated a baseball contract provision allowing him to play COLLEGE football for 1 year...He is grateful &amp; will honor agreement w/A’s &amp; wants to be great MLB player. While every player would like to do both he understands why he’s focusing on baseball.
Results of the Today’s Game Era Ballot (12 votes needed for election): Lee Smith (16 votes, 100%); Harold Baines (12 votes, 75 percent); Lou Piniella (11 votes, 68.8%); Albert Belle, Joe Carter, Will Clark, Orel Hershiser, Davey Johnson, Charlie Manuel and George Steinbrenner &lt; 5
Congratulations to the newest members of the hall of fame — Lee Smith and Harold Baines
Yankees also plan to meet with Bryce Harper, though st least publicly they seem to question whether there’s a fit there considering their outfield strength/glut. @JeffPassan and @TBrownYahoo 1st mentioned meeting would occur
Yankees like Manny Machado and will meet with Machado but source says they will not pay $300M for Machado. Phillies, Chisox and mystery teams(?) seen as main competitors.
Today’s question: If George Steinbrenner, who was suspended twice by MLB, gets into the Hall of Fame, does that mean we need to think more seriously about Manny Ramirez as a Cooperstown candidate?
Robertson and Ottavino are believed high on Red Sox list of back-end relief targets. Of course they’d like to have Kimbrel and Kelly back but they are free agents too. Deep pen market also includes Britton, Miller, Familia, more.
Padres, the most rumored team for a Syndergaard trade, as of this moment “don’t look like a great fit.” Mets want 2019 impact so it’s no surprise they seek Fernando Tatis Jr.; SD has made him untouchable.
Tony La Russa was a little down about the Patriots’ last-second defeat. I told him “Yeah, Belichick made a big mistake.” La Russa responded: “Bill doesn’t make mistakes.”
The results of the 10-man veteran ballot for the Hall of Fame that includes Steinbrenner, Piniella and Belle will be announced at 5:15 Las Vegas time. Steinbrenner is an interesting case anyway, but Joe Torre being on the committee is an intriguing side note.
Jose Canseco has been spotted near the winter meetings, but it appears he’s just trying his hand at poker.
Dayán Viciedo, ex of the white sox, signed a 3-year deal with chunichi of the Japan League. Believed to be for $10M.
Just saw all the phillies people check in. It appeared they had not one but two suitcases full of stupid money
Interesting to note that Zach Weber and Noah Syndergaard tweets have the same number of retweets (and Zach has more likes!)
Yanks are said to be one of several teams still in pursuit of JA Happ, their own free agent
First to mention chuck Hernandez as a possibility for mets bullpen coach was @Joelsherman1
Mets are about to name Chili Davis hitting coach, Chuck Hernandez bullpen coach and Luis Rojas Quality Control coach. Rojas was the Mets’ double-a manager last year.
Nobody seems to think a Syndergaard trade is very likely. But the Mets are intending to listen while here in Vegas. Will take something eye opening.
Big acquisition: mets hired Zach Weber away from brewers for their p.r dept.
@keithlaw @KenTremendous Well it’s better than coward, booger hole or bald head
Not sure what the Marlins precise trade request is from Mets for Realmuto. But heard Mets do not want to do Conforto-Nimmo combo, and they don’t want to trade Rosario at all.
In astros talks for Goldy, JB Bukauskas and Cionel Perez were in play. D-Backs took the surer bet and more diversified package from #STLCards instead.
Nate Eovaldi is coming to Las Vegas for the announcement that he’s back with the Bosox. Press conference tomorrow.

With Corbin off the board, Phillies will consider Dallas Keuchel. Seek 1 starter, preferably a lefty
Marlins heard from 14 teams regarding star C JT Realmuto this winter, including 3 in division (all but Nats, who tried hardest last year). From Mets, top 2 targets would be Brandon Nimmo and Amed Rosario. Braves less likely since have Flowers/McCann, r targeting an OF, pitchers.
to this point the braves and marlins have had no serious trade discussions this winter regarding jt realmuto (at least not to the point where the marlins gave asking price). Atlanta signed McCann to go with flowers under the belief Miami wants to deal Realmuto out of the division
Robinson chorines is close to a deal with the Astros, as @Ken_Rosenthal reported
nats have basically replaced salaries of wieters (11M), gio (12M) and madson (8M) with Corbin (23M) and Gomes (8M). so while other teams are wondering whether Corbin signing means they are out on Harper, the belief is that they are not necessarily out.
Phillies, like yankees, offered 5-year deal for Corbin
nats wad first mentioned as winning team for Corbin by @chelsea_janes (tho it was almost a 4-way photo finish!)
Yankees offer for Corbin was $100M for 5 years. had they been the choice, of course it's possible they might have gone a little bit higher, but not to 6 years.
the Corbin deal with Nats does include deferrals, as @Ken_Rosenthal said. #nats
sources: Corbin gets $140M over 6
Nats and Corbin have the deal. 6 years. north of $125M.
Yanks didn't want to go 6 years for Corbin, so that was why he went elsewhere. will look at Eovaldi and Happ now.
sources: Corbin will sign a 6-year deal for about yu darvish $, pending physical. team is not known yet, however.
matt moore deal with tigers is for $2.5M plus incentives
Manny Machado's last 24 hours: team that knows him well and promises to spend "stupid money," traded for a different SS (phillies, segura) &amp; his most recent team is courting his main free agent competition (dodgers, harper, via @JeffPassan and @TBrownYahoo)
@thatguyjp1 @Ken_Rosenthal Please seek help
Yeah, that ain’t gonna get it done. Realmuto real interest is in winning anyway but word is when he did name a price it was close to “buster posey money,” which woulda put them about 100M apart. JT isn’t claiming he’s Posey but he’s 2 yrs closer to free agency than when BP signed https://t.co/eSvYUH2VKX
kyler murray  is said to be a co-favorite for the heisman trophy. but his baseball dream remains. his baseball agent scott boras says: "he will be in spring training with the a's."
Patrick Corbin decision is expected to come soon. yankees, phillies and nats are all serious, in the game with strong bids and have to be considered the favorites, though a couple others have been looking at ways to try to pull an upset.

I'll be careful hear since Swarzak is not in the deal, but I am hearing Juan nicasio is under discussion and may go to the Phillies in the segura deal.

@SDES17 U ever make s mistake
@MLoera17 @jaysonst Grow up
Now hearing Swarzak is not in the deal with philly
Now hearing Swarzak may not be in Segura deal, as @jaysonst said
Anthony Swarzak will go to Philly in Segura trade once completed as @BNightengale suggested
Medicals, Segura approval still need as part of finishing touches on Segura deal. Tho Segura is productive, trade market was said to be fairly limited.
Carlos Santana and JP Crawford are going to mariners in the Segura deal. More player(s) involved as well.
Mariners prez Kevin Mather last July 6: “Our major league club is not only better than when we started, we are younger and more athletic with a window of opportunity that is just opening. We are expecting to compete every year for a playoff spot and to win the World Series.”
Segura’s agent Nez Balelo differed from the person outside Segura’s camp who said JS “wanted out worse than anyone.” Nez says: “If a deal makes sense to Jean then he will consider and there are a lot of variables to consider in order to waive his full no trade and move on ...”
A recap: On July 11, Seattle (58-35, .624 win %) had fourth-best record in MLB. M’s went 31-38 rest of way. And now tearing down the house.
One involved person’s opinion regarding Segura’s willingness to waive no-trade clause (not from his camp, so it’s just an opinion):  “Segura will gladly waive no trade clause ... he wants out worse than anyone.”
It has been suggested a Segura deal wouldn’t preclude Machado for Philly (theoretically, one could play SS, the other 3B) but Phils are thought likely to focus on one free agent mega star at a time and most believe their first focus will be on Bryce, not Manny.
I might need to start following Trent booty https://t.co/8sx6MzjdGV
As of this moment no word that Segura has agreed to waive his full no-trade yet. Mariners have been in talks with Philly about Segura and @BNightengale says they have agreement on players.
There’s been talk of Carlos Santana being included with prospects in Philly’s talks with Seattle for Jean Segura to balance the $ but Mariners may be resistant to that. J.P. Crawford is among prospects discussed as @JSalisburyNBCS said
@lou_rabito Thank u Lou
@LukeMeals @AlbaneseLaura @RiverAveBlues U r blocked luke
@LukeMeals @AlbaneseLaura @RiverAveBlues I didn’t say they seek to trade Sanchez. I said there was no deal to be made because the yankees aren’t enthused about giving a big package including Sanchez. Read more carefully.
@FireNFury789 I didn’t say they want to move him

First to say it was down to physicals @TenchyRodEspn 1st to say $20M ballpark @JeffPassan
Complete deal is Cano, Diaz plus $20M for Bruce, Swarzak, Kelenic, Dunn and Bautista
Mariners send $20M to mets to complete deal

Nick Goody, Indians settle at 675K
Matt Davidson, who wants to pitch some more, was also nontendered #chisox
Tim Beckham and Caleb Joseph also nontendered #orioles
Avisail Garcia also non-tendered. #chisox
Some pretty good players nontendered: Schoop, Hamilton, fiers, s. Miller, bour, boxberger, graveman, solarte, shoemaker, Flores, Mccann, b. Parker, torreyes, avilan, a. Wilson, g. Hernandez, m. Bush. Free agent list growing.
Panik actually gets $3.85M, a bit better. Deal is guaranteed #SFGisnts
Sam Dyson, giants settle at $5M
Joe Panik, giants settle st $3.8M
Here’s the whole deal https://t.co/UpL1oPfKNZ
Stearns also told @Haudricourt and @AdamMcCalvy the Schoop trade was “on me.” Of course the trades for moustakas, Gio, soria, grandy, etc. all worked. Those were on his ledger too.

Sammy solis, nats settle at 850K
Danny Salazar, indians settle at $4.5M
Yan Gomes is being acquired by the #Nats. Gives them a nice catching combo with Suzuki. Minor League RF Daniel Johnson going the other way to #Indians . (sorry if you saw earlier that mentioned Michael Taylor; he's not involved)

Memorably, Wilmer Flores didn’t take it well the last time he almost left the Mets but he has a positive outlook this time. Agent Jim Mcnamara said, “We are excited for a new opportunity.”
Hearing Wilmer Flores will be non tendered by mets
Here’s why a MadBum deal may not solve things. Later, I heard the #SFGiants do plan to keep him. (Also: why a summer trade could make sense) https://t.co/8ISARRrzk2
as suggested earlier, there'sl a little work to do to work out the $ part of the Cano deal, but the players have remained the same: cano &amp; Diaz (plus $) for bruce, Swarzak, Dunn, Kelenic and bautista. it is "not derailed" and expectation is it gets done, probably early next week.
what Addison Russell did was horrible. his statement is appropriately strong. he apologized to his former wife Melissa (and others), took responsibility for his actions, admitted he is in the early stage of a process to become a better person and committed himself to doing that. https://t.co/nQtMYJKgq7
Phils do have interest in jean segura. that wouldn't necessarily preclude machado. but both surely prefer to play ss, and segura has full no-trade. phillies could put 1 or other at 3B but would either player agree? Phils-mariners have good rapport; klentak worked for dipoto in la

From last night’s record @Fancred show (for viewership), thoughts on Patrick Corbin and the tour teams https://t.co/dwWtnd8q4j
West Cosst bias? Market strong for lefty Yusei Kikuchi, with dodgers, padres, giants and mariners among those believed in. Sea and SF would be interesting, as one is tearing down the other thought to be considering retooling.
Hearing there’s still some work to do, tho players appear pretty set (cano/Diaz for bruce/Swarzak/dunn/Kelenic/Bautista. Suggestion is issue involves the $, presumably the precise amount coming to mets. Unknown if cano will be asked to defer $/rework big deal.
Cano deal is thought to be close, but at this point the Mets/Mariners are not expected to announce anything today.
There is cash in Cano/Diaz deal coming to Mets. Pieces appear to be in place and trade expected to be finalized soon, presuming approvals (Cano and commish) and medicals are approved. Cano, Diaz, $ to mets, Bruce. Swarzak, Kelenic, Dunn, possibly 1 more prospect to Mariners.
Sides are optimistic cano and Diaz trade for package including Bruce, Swarzak, dunn and Kelenic will be completed soon @Joelsherman1 said similar
A nice goodbye by a class act https://t.co/yJydNvG3wH
Reasons this could be the quickest waiving of a no-trade in history: 1. Cano loves NY 2. He wants to play 2B (in Seattle he might play 1B) 3. He’d work for his former agent Brodie Van Wagenen 4. He’d leave a turmoil ridden team that recently was accused of anti-Latin bias
Inside Baseball notes: phils who could hit block, nick back to braves? 2 teams that tried for Donaldson, tribe trade talk, greinke/goldy, Noah fits, legacy has buyer, astros big targets, Joe Maddon, ottavino, Grandal, Schoop, Chavez, segura, Clark, dipoto. https://t.co/4BlI6abben
To update: mets, #SFGiants are among others to check in on realmuto in recent weeks (preference is to trade JT out of division but it’s not quite an absolute) https://t.co/yv9DFZ21mk
Jay Bruce is in the Cano/Diaz deal currently on the table. And as said, so is Swarzak.
Mets deal for Cano and Diaz is close. Different combinations discussed but most recent one has Bruce and Swarzak going to Seattle to offset some money. Some combo of Kelenic, Dunn and McNeil in that one go to Seattle. @Ken_Rosenthal on it
Technically, Volquez agreed to that contract when he signed 2 year deal last spring. It became official when he was added to major league roster last week. #rangers
No surprise here. Cano confidant: “Canó isn’t going to take a lot of convincing to go back to a city that he loves.” (But no he hasn’t been asked quite yet)
Jesse Hahn agrees with kc for 800K. Cheslor cuthbert for 850
Volquez also has $5M in incentives in rangers deal
Edinson Volquez signs $2M deal with rangers, plus many incentives
Mariners. Mets talks r intense. Cano and Diaz would go to Mets in proposed deals. Combo of Bruce/Swarzak, Kelenic/Dunn to mariners. Still working on $ and players. But since Cano has full no trade, wants NY, and as said NYY not involved, would be surprise if didn’t happen to NYM.

Mets and mariners are having many talks on Cano. Word is, no deal is imminent. However, deal makes too much sense. M’s want to unload Cano. Mets want 2B, they like Cano and would love Diaz. Plus, Cano has full no trade and surely prefers NY.

On #MLBNow right now with @RonDarlingJr @aybaybader and @roflo talkin ball
dan o'dowd on @MLBNetwork yesterday suggested padres send paddack, lucchesi and hedges for syndergaard. there are other combinations that could work as well for SD. rays, rockies and others could make sense. but not many teams have 3 impact pieces at SP, 2B, C and CF to trade.
padres have made Tatis jr., Gore and likely Arias off limits but they still have the makings of a potential trade for Noah Syndergaard. SD has young pitchers Paddack, Allen, Quantrill, Nix and Lucchesi, catchers Hedges and Mejia and a young OF or 2. might be best match.
Mets hire Allard Baird as VP player development/scouting. Very well respected around the game. Van Wagenen remaking front office.
White Sox hire Frank Menechino for aaa hitting coach
there are the cano rumors, but @DannyKnobler has another suggestion -- yes, that the mets should follow through on their mostly under-the-radar discussion of a run at Bryce harper https://t.co/wicZX3Xrvn

Adam Guttridge indeed has been hired by mets as assistant GM of systematic development
Mets interviewed Adam Guttridge, an analytics expert who currently works as a consultant for MLB teams, for a front office position. Possible new assistant GM.
Yankees have insurance policy on Ellsbury, which turned out very wise, but that presumably still stands in the event of a trade.
Mariners, Yanks talked about a Cano return to the Bronx. Ellsbury would have been going to Seattle in proposalbut Mariners didn’t want to eat extra $ at time. Cano has $120M left, Ellsbury $48M. Ellsbury May be more open to waiving no-trade, and good chance Canó might accept NY.

mets have checked in on big free agent pitchers, including ja haap, which may show how serious they are about the Syndergaard talks. doesn't mean they will trade Noah of course, as they need mlb ready impact back at multiple spots. c, cf and 2b would be the areas of interest

Nice to see Bill Evers added to Twins coaching staff. Longtime Rays coach has Baldelli link. Fine gentleman.
prevalent baseball exec opinion: Harper &amp; Machado wind up with NY &amp; Philly, 1 to each. but which one goes to which team? philly seems most aggressive, yanks have admitted interest in machado but downplayed interest in harper (they have had internal and external BH talks however)

hear at least half-dozen teams are believed to be real players for Noah Syndergaard. mets are seriously considering deals for him if they could fill multiple holes with real impact. will be one of the big winter meetings storylines.
Mariners have talked to multiple teams about Leake, and with full no-trade, it’s up to him. One thing to keep in mind: as @MarkAselstine pointed out, he is from San Diego.
@BengieMolina1 That’s great bengie. Best wishes to your family.

@NormOrnstein Maybe a backup. Plan is for Suzuki to start a majority of games
Justin Lawrence has been added to the rockies roster
Phillies also are thought to be a player for the big pitchers, Corbin, Keuchel etc.
nats focus now appears to be on the rotation. Corbin, Keuchel, Eovaldi, Morton all potential fits. could also look for 1 more in pen, maybe 2B. then later comes the big question: do they need Harper?

MLB owners are expected to vote to extend commissioner Rob Manfred’s contract today
Elias is an interesting call. Ben Cherington, Ned Colletti were in the mix with proven track records and strong resumes. Orioles ownership, which never funded analytics, is sending a message about their belief in them with this hire.
sources: Astros assistant GM Mike Elias is indeed the choice of the Orioles to run their baseball ops department. @BNightengale was on top of this way ahead

Things looked positive a week ago in Dave Roberts/Dodgers multiyear talks. But things are at a standstill at the moment with the sides still apart. By picking up the option, LA has a year to work it out. So there’s that.
@BabyBiird Thanks for your unbiased opinion
@s_hoelzli83 Maybe if we were big Yankee fans like you we’d be more objective

This sounds like what’s precisely going on there. Good job by @PJ_Mooney https://t.co/Ddki8S0C4h
Pollock declined the QO
Yankees (and others) want Corbin https://t.co/NmrGJoJRjY
Corbin didn’t have much of a decision there. With his credentials and year could get a nine-figure deal ($100M plus)
Patrick Corbin of course is rejecting the qualifying offer
Not a humblebrag, just a straight brag. Already 2 for 2 predicting exactly right (cc and ryu). Harper, Machado and the rest will be harder. https://t.co/nP5bH7t2WX
everyone but ryu is expected to decline the qualifying offer
dodgers top priorities appear to be bullpen (back-end help for Jansen would be preferable) and catcher (though grandal may not be so likely since they may prefer short term guy with great catching prospects ruiz &amp; smith on horizon)
dodgers do not expect yasmani grandal to take the qualifying offer. would be surprised if he did. putting aside the postseason, he was one of the better catchers in the game last 3 years.
ryu had terrific numbers last year (except for the 101 IP). so qualifying offer of $17.9M makes sense for him
sources: hyun-jin ryu will take the qualifying offer.
Ibwaa (internet baseball writers) sected ohtani and Acuna as their top rookies, andujar and Soto 2nd, buehler and Torres 3rd

Ten observations from the GM meetings https://t.co/79kCZsTp2Y
Congrats to Joe Mauer who announced his retirement today with a personal letter to Twins fans
ramos and maldonado are among catchers of interest for the mets. but they are expected to investigate realmuto. again. he is repped by van wagenen's old agency. but the issue there is: would the mets trade the prospects to make such a mega deal? price tag is understandably huge!
mets are not seen as a player for machado. of course $ are always a consideration, but the sense is that they don't see him as the right player to spend big on. that doesn't mean they won't make a splash. they are looking at catcher, bullpen and infield.
jp Ricciardi, mets agree to part ways, team announces
MLB owners meeting next week in Atlanta: commissioner Rob Manfred is expected to unanimously be awarded an extension, likely for 5 years (@BNightengale and Ron Blum 1st), plus discussion of fox tv deal and ways to get more action/offense on the field (shifts, pitch clocks, etc.)

I'm in Carlsbad at the GM meetings, and I'll be live with @JennyDell_ On-Air @Fancred App at 7 pm EST taking all your questions on #Harper, Machado, free agent pitching and all the latest rumors out here. Tune in and ask your ? on the App.  https://t.co/tS0OK5V0xg
Mets are one of almost all who’ve shown interest in Marwin Gonzalez
Mets checked in on Wilson Ramos and Martin Maldonado in catching search. Other catchers who are free agents: Grandal, Chirinos, Lucroy, Suzuki, Wieters. Via trade maybe Realmuto, Gomes/Perez
Welke was a great one #Harvardman Don used to joke that deserved respect cause he’s a Harvard man. He was from Harvard, Ill. And went to Harvard High. In truth, he deserved it cause he was a great scout and even better person. https://t.co/ImKtTZvKIs
Versatility is in: nats, yanks, reds among many interested in Josh Harrison. Marwin’s market? “Everyone but one team.”
They’ve extended two 17.9M qualifying offers, so if both accept, it could get sticky (though teams can trade players who accept the QO). Ryu is thought to be thinking about it, Grandal is seen as a bit less likely (but off his postseason, he probably should consider it) https://t.co/gwwEHEGxP7
Inside Baseball notes: will goldy go? Greinke? Braves needs, o’s search, Cruz players, can’t spell Seattle without sale, tribe need, marwin market, yanks/mets targets, Harrison teams, Arenado, realmuto, rays as movers/shakers, team for Sonny? Cards targets https://t.co/nvGSaR4M8P
The Mets are asking about catchers so it appears they don’t believe they have their starting catcher on the current roster
One other reason Harper didnt take the Nats offer of about 300M for 10 years is that it did not include a no-trade clause, which is usually a certainty in mega deals. The offer is being viewed as “preliminary,” though for the moment both the nats and Harper are shopping elsewhere
Kang got 3M guarantee plus 2.5M incentives #Pirates
Goin on with joe and @EvanRobertsWFAN now to talk ball for regular gig @WFAN660
Inside Baseball: 10 observations from the MLB GM meetings https://t.co/79kCZsBNEo
Pirates sign jung ho kang back. 1 year deal. @adamdberry 1st
Paul Goldschmidt is drawing significant interest (understandably) but not from Yankees. Maybe they really will give Luke Voit a shot.
Yankees plan is said to be: pitching, pitching, pitching, and maybe Machado (or a lesser infielder)
mariners are close to trading mike zunino and guillermo heredia to the rays for mallex smith. @RyanDivish and @Ken_Rosenthal are on top of it
while the nats' offer to bryce harper of about 300M over 10 years is technically "off the table" now, they would welcome him to return to talk about it, &amp; that holds until they've spent the $ (or a large chunk of it) elsewhere. harper is busy looking around at this time however.
Farhan Zaidi, new Giants President of Baseball ops, is expected to arrive at the gm meetings tonight and to hit the ground running
Dave Roberts’ 1.1M option was picked up by dodgers but as a vehicle to continue talking. Expectation remains they’ll do a 4-year deal.
Jim Riggleman will interview in person for mets bench coaching job next week
Boras points out that LSU out-drew the Miami Marlins and how bad that looks for the marlins and MLB. Boras: “The fans of Florida have certainly brought the MIA to Miami.”
Folks see Ryu as possibility to take 17.9M qualifying offer. Grandal, Pollock seen as not as likely. Harper, Kimbrel, Keuchel, Corbin will decline QO.
Boras won’t name the asking price for Bryce Harper, but it’s pretty clear it’s much higher than $300M (explanation is in here) https://t.co/tSw3aTkDZJ
some possibilities for farhan zaidi's new front office in SF might include: billy owens, dan kantrovitz, dan feinstein (via @Feinsand) and sam geaney
Yanks still seek 2 starting pitchers even with CC back. Corbin, Happ, Kluber, Carrasco, Paxton all in play
Regarding report braves made “strong” offer for realmuto, source says braves have yet to make any offer for realmuto. They do make some sense as they seek a catcher and have big prospects, but no legs to this story now.
My expert’s Harper prediction is looking better and better following @chelsea_janes revelation that about 300M was offered by nats. His other calls are famously good, too. Icymi the 1st 7 times https://t.co/nP5bH7KDOv
thoughts: 1. it's likely now harper will beat stanton's $325M record. 2. it's a nice try, but the nats had to believe it was a long shot to prevent a superstar from filing for free agency with days to go. 3. hard to imagine he can't just go back &amp; take it/negotiate off it. https://t.co/d6DGOZPXUj
Goin on @mullyhaugh at 840 ct talkin Chicago Baseball @670TheScore

Folks with Dodgers seem genuinely disappointed Farhan has left for Giants. But give the team this; allowing him to better himself was right thing to do. not all teams do the right thing; recall that the Orioles wouldn’t let gm Dan Duquette interview for president job in Toronto)
The Indians won’t announce or confirm deal or no deal but it’s believed GM Mike Chernoff has been extended. Chernoff wouldn’t say and only offered only 3 words: “I love Cleveland.”
Zaidi's title is President of Baseball Operations #SFGiants
Farhan Zaidi has indeed taken the job to run  #SFGiants baseball operations @hankschulman 1st
Dodger moves up the coast as the Giants get their man https://t.co/zorFujvV9y
Sabathia 8M deal has no incentives. Pending physical. #yankees
It isn’t known whether #SFGiants have set deadline, but folks expect Farhan Zaidi to decide very soon whether to take SF offer to run their baseball ops. Generally speaking (and nothing to go with Zaidi whose team played til end) SF has been frustrated by process length/turndowns
Nats made multiyear contract offer to Bryce Harper on dsy of final home game Sept. 26. Needless to say, he did not accept that offer, but Nats remain interested. Details unknown.
First to say CC was close to going back to tanks was @Joelsherman1 first saying deal is 8M were @Joelsherman1 and @Ken_Rosenthal
Roberts and Dodgers will have deal. Believed to be completed by tomorrow for 4 years.
Sources: CC signs back with yankees
Teams on Nelson Cruz: astros, white sox, rays, more
Rough break for talented young pitcher https://t.co/zO9yN7FYQO
Mr. October showed up at the GM meetings to assist the Yankees. Also pictured: Yankees exec Jim Hendry https://t.co/RFIF25teOw
Farhan Zaidi is said to be the choice of the #SFGiants to lead their baseball department, and the Dodgers appear prepared to sign off on the move. “The ball’s in Farhan’s Court,” is the way one rival exec put it. Another way to put it: It’s up to him.
Riggleman fits mets as bench coach and appears to have excellent chance. 1) he’s team player who’d embrace the job even though he’s managed in 5 places 2) 4 of 5 teams he’s managed were NL teams. (No hire likely this week tho as Mickey is away)
Rays need a catcher and will have to acquire one. They have big list of names, including zunino
Good slogan. But you have a day job https://t.co/0jFmUoTwqp
There is indeed progress on Dave Roberts extension talks now, as @Ken_Rosenthal said
Catching up on credit: @JeffPassan 1st mentioned mariners possible selloff this week
Dodgers and Dave Roberts have been talking about an extension for several days. Still don’t have a deal though. There’s hope but if they don’t get it done now, one option would be for team to pick up his $1.1M option for 2019.
Reason Mariners will keep Haniger, Diaz and Gonzales is due to service time, cost (and of course talent). Anyone else could go.
Sounds now like Mariners intend to hold onto Haniger, Diaz and Gonzalez. Word is: “Everyone else is up for grabs.”
Edwin Diaz is an interesting Mariner who could be dealt. He won Rivera award but if team rebuilds a great closer is not as essential. FA market is strong in pen already: Kimbrel, Britton, Ottavino, Robertson, Kelly, Miller, Allen, Familia, Brach, Herrera, Holland, Romo, Norris
Indians want to pare 145M payroll (high for them). Kluber as very late bloomer signed reasonable contract, but high $4M Cy Young escalators raise what started as $13.5M average salary over next/last 3 years (last 2 years are team options)
Yankees have interest in Kluber, Carrasco and Paxton in addition to free agent targets Corbin, Happ and CC. NYY meeting with at least Indians today.
Dodgers gm Farhan Zaidi is indeed a target of #SFGiants for top front office job.  Teams aren’t obligated to allow execs under contract to go, but they often do for higher job (herehe’d be No. 1 baseball exec, not No. 2). Interesting since it’s LA and SF. @Joelsherman1 on it
Nice hire! Congrats Keegs https://t.co/bPE5TS3ZKU
More agent news: Jay Alou has gone out on his own. Reps at least 2 free agents this winter: Ervin Santana and Jose Bautista
Agent Dave Meter has a fairly straightforward pitch on client Craig Kimbrel. Points out Meter: He’s the best alltime, not just recently but alltime. Lowest ERA, lowest batting average against, lowest OPS against. Also points out he saved all his chances even this postseason.
D-backs are willing to listen on anyone, including stars Goldy and Greinke. One rival suggested he thought Goldschmidt trade was remote. Another said he thought Az might have to pay about one-third of Greinke’s 34M salary to deal him. Don’t rule it out, tho.
It’s been 13 years since the White Sox won the World Series in a sweep, and they are telling people they need to take a step forward now. They are said to have $, and aren’t ruling anything out, including Harper or Machado. @jonmorosi mentioned chisox as possible player for big 2
Player movement but from agent to agent is a big story early this winter https://t.co/23FirEeXtm
Jim Riggleman, said to be on mets radar for bench coach job, will be among those interviewed
Jose Reyes aims to play next year. Still only 35.
Jim RIggleman is a consideration for Mets bench coach, among others. Would be good veteran voice.
Indians are willing to listen on almost anyone (presumably not Lindor or Ramirez but probably anyone else)
Given the opportunity to shoot down rumors they could go for both Harper and Machado, a Philly person did not do it. Everything’s on the table it seems. They clearly aim to win. #phillies
Charlie Morton ruminated earlier this year about maybe hangin em up after 2019, or possibly even 2018. But after his excellent year he’s seeking a multiyear deal. The lack of s qualifying offer won’t hurt. Rich Hill, who got 48M for 3 a couple years back, is a nice per-year comp.
Longtime agents Brian Peters and Kenny Felder are said to be moving from Legacy to Excel. Likely means George Springer and others go to Excel, too.
Awards finalists r announced. Al mvp: betts, Ramirez, trout; nl mvp: Arenado, Baez, yelich; al Cy: kluber, snell, Verlander; nl cy: deGrom, Nola, scherzer.

Derek Shelton, a runnerup for twins and rangers manager jobs, will remain bench coach in Minnesota
Free agent OF Michael Brantley has moved and will be repped by Excel
Yusei Kikuchi, 27, is 73-46 lifetime with a 2.77 era. Seibu’s decision to post allows him to move to majors. BorasCorp to rep. Dodgers, padres, phillies among interested teams.
Yusei Kikuchi, lhp being posted by the Seibu Lions, will be repped by the Scott Boras company
Arenado has only a year to go before free agency but Rockies would love to do something long term. “Absolutely, there’s hope,” GM Jeff Bridich said. Arenado had to like Rox progress in ‘18 but could wait to see team’s direction. In meantime he should set arb mark (Donaldson $23M)
Jays are looking for pitching. Have plenty of positional depth. Just need pitchers. Also need coaches.
Mike Matheny is a candidate for advisory role with the royals. @dgoold 1st mentioned
Keep hearing Ben Cherington’s name as one of interest to the Orioles for gm. Bigger question is whether he’d be interested. He didn’t pursue mets, hasn’t pursued giants. Said to like current job in front office with jays.
I’d like to see about 6 of them get in, tho that’s not possible (and no, not Joey belle!) https://t.co/SUN2XiVMis

Have heard David Chadd’s name connected as candidate for Orioles gm job. The Tigers assistant gm was known for drafting top prospects for tigers, and before that Red Sox. Drafted Porcello, Pedroia and other key pieces to championships.
Mets two big areas of interest: bullpen and offense. It’s not as bad as it may seem: they are strong and probably set in rotation, and there are many, many good pen options on the market. Offense is a bigger puzzle. Could look at catcher, 2B, possibly 3B, 1B and/or CF.
Nobody helped their free agency case more than Eovaldi this postseason. Stuff, guts both fantastic. Naturally, Red Sox would like to have him back.
After a couple years mostly sitting out free agency, reds finally have some $ to spend. Starting pitching is the priority. Will consider top of market (Corbin, Keuchel). They liked Harvey, too. Tough to get pitchers to Great America. Also will consider adding an outfielder.
@jeffromcclellan I’m guessing you know more about baseball than art too
Quick response to my sculpture remark from Marlins just came in (they obviously see the tweets): “Sculpture is literally moving right outside the building, about 200 feet from current location - everyone can enjoy it every day.”
The previous “temporary tenants” aren’t too happy about this move. My take: the sculpture was distinctive, interesting and fit Miami. A mistake. https://t.co/quTvakPrni
Congrats to Corey Dickerson for winning a gold glove. He was once viewed as a dh type but put in the work to become a plus defender.
@DABorja Not my first choice
Interesting, too, that Javier Baez has never won a gold glove
Many great defenders are snubbed in gold glove awards: Jason heyward, Lorenzo Cain, kolten Wong and Brandon Crawford all snubbed in the nl alone
Yankees will look into Machado, and it will depend on the price. Pitching is the priority though (and as said here, with Corbin and Happ top the list)
Good advice here miami dade https://t.co/ySZALXtZJ8
@billcolrus Thank you. I feel (a little) bad about that
@TurnerSportsNet The folks who do they probably go 4 for 130
@Doug_Adams2 The $ is what really counts
Funny that 2 teams head to the GM meetings without a GM. Good job by the Mets for making their hire in a timely manner.
Hot Stove gets going Monday in San Diego. Here were my expert’s predictions for his top 131 free agents. Someone got 34 times 11 (from him). Icymi https://t.co/nP5bH7t2WX
Top 131 free agents, ranked by projected contracts (the expert’s projection and my guess). Icymi https://t.co/nP5bH7t2WX

Haines, who comes to Milwaukee from the cubs, was a longtime marlins organizational hitting coach https://t.co/QGHAb5M1YP
Andy Haines was hired by brewers as hitting coach
The Dodgers properly did not over-react to one or two moves, or one game. Big picture: Roberts has done a fabulous job three straight years.
With Kershaw deal done, the Dodgers have started extension talks with manager Dave Roberts. The team holds option for 2019 but now there’s hope something longer could get done within a few days, possibly this weekend.
Rangers are hiring Chris Woodward as manager, confirmed @BNightengale 1st

It’s amazing, I think Kevin Millar has hit on Manny’s very issue @fancred  with ⁦@JennyDell_⁩ https://t.co/7kdU0wsHY3
So 7 received the $17.9M qualifying offer: Corbin, Grandal, Harper, Keuchel, Kimbrel, Pollock, Ryu. (Remembered: traded players like Machado and Eovaldi cant get one, and neither can players who’ve had them before like Nelson Cruz)
Kevin Millar, who was great last night on the show, answered the bloody sock question @fancred with ⁦@JennyDell_⁩ https://t.co/nGRu35tNNm
Marwin did not receive a qualifying offer #astros
Ryu received qualifying offer. Interesting call for him. #dodgers
No qualifying offer for Charlie Morton. Could benefit him should he want to go multiyear deal. #astros
It’s only right Dodgers and Kershaw stay together. @TBrownYahoo 1st on deal @Ken_Rosenthal 1st on $
Kimbrel gets the qualifying offer. No chance he accepts, as he’ll get offers for long deals.
Kershaw and Dodgers have deal for 93M over 3 years
Inside Baseball: Expert predictions on 131 free agents, and mine too (I am already looking way wrong on Grandal) https://t.co/nP5bH7t2WX
There is indeed optimism Kershaw and Dodgers are working it out today. @JeffPassan 1st to say
Red Sox will, of course, extend a qualifying offer to Craig kimbrel
D-backs intend to extend the qualifying offer to aj pollock as well as Patrick Corbin
Angels new hitting coach is Jeremy Reed
Grandal should take it imo https://t.co/cmC3bsX9v9
Yankees biggest pitching targets are Corbin and Happ. Many good ones on market including Keuchel, Eovaldi, Ryu, Morton, Gio, Miley, CC even if Kershaw stays in LA as expected. Yes, lots of lefties on list.
This explains why smyly was traded to the rangers specifically (my take: Hamels is a bargain at the $20M option price) https://t.co/WRVpw7eKGY
Cubs traded smyly to rangers to clear a little financial room and pick up Hamels $20M option @jcrasnick 1st
Catching up on credit: @Joelsherman1 1st with freese deal done @jorgecastillo 1st with $
Predictions for the dollars and years for the top 131 free agents. By my expert (who is realty good) and me (not as good) https://t.co/nP5bH7t2WX
freese was bought out for 500K, then agreed to 4.5M deal. so 5M. #dodgers
freese gets 5M on dodgers deal
Orioles have let go Director of Pro Scouting/Special Projects Patrick Di Gregory. Was instrumental in deadline trades including Machado trade, plus Renato Nunez waiver claim and acquisition of Miguel Castro
So Marco Gonzales, to clarify, agreed to drop his grievance and the potential for more service time in exchange for a bigger deal now, one that guarantees a 2nd year and is about 700-800K more than a 0-2 player would normally get over 2 years #mariners
A lot of folks were shocked by how high the Marco Gonzales deal is since he is not arbitration eligible until after 2020. Via club sources, the 1.9K figure is partly explainable by Gonzales having a previous grievance pending over the timing of a demotion while with the cardinals

Mariners agree to deal with Marco Gonzales. 2 years, $1.9M. Interesting deal for player who isn’t yet arb eligible, seems quite good for Marco.

@jdh124 @RiverAveBlues They did not.
Dodgers have momentum toward a deal with David Freese. No word yet on Kershaw but the extension of deadline to Friday aft could be seen as a positive sign

kershaw and freese option deadlines were both extended last night to Friday at 4 p.m. et (1 pm in LA). Kershaw has opt out with 65M and 2 years to go, dodgers have 6M option on freese with 500K buyout #dodgers
Dodgers, Kershaw have agreed to extend deadline til tomorrow ar 4 pm et. Seems to be a decent sign for figuring it out. They want to stay together, it seems.
@baseballfor_all @masnSteve @southernpearlkt Awesome!

A’s exercise 4.25m option on Rodney
Gardner returns to yanks for 7.5M 1-year deal (plus $2M buyout so 9.5M) @Feinsand 1st
David price never was going to opt out over the money, not with $127M and 4 years left. the opt out was put in there mostly just in case things weren't going well with the Red Sox. well, things are going pretty good.
catching up on credit: @BNightengale 1st said nats were finalizing Rosenthal deal @Joelsherman1 1st with structure, approximate $. (also, they got the name right)
don't know if Kershaw is gong to opt out by tonight but don't see a lot of risk in him doing so. doesn't mean he's expecting to leave. in fact, he may just want to stay longer. and LA always wanted him to be a "dodger for life." could extending deal at slightly lower aaa work?
Just to clear that up it is Rosenthal who gets 7M for 1 year guarantee and can make close to 30M over 2. 6M salary plus 1M buyout. Can earn up to 14M with appearance incentives. Option for 2020 vests for 14M at 50 games or 30 games finished.
Rosenthal can make 14M in 2019 with appearance incentives, and up to 40M total. #nats
Of course I meant Rosenthal not holland.
Holland gets 6M for 1m plus 1m buyout. Vesting option is worth 15m. Vests at 50 games or 30 games finished #nats
Holland gets 7M guarantee in nats deal but with vesting option. Can earn close to 30M.

Elvis Andrus will not use an opt-out and leave the rangers and the $58M and four years left after his 1 injury-plagued year. He has another opt-out next year however.
Dave Roberts hasn’t heard on $1.1M team option yet. From here, he’s one of MLB’s best. There was brief discussion about an extension earlier, and he deserves it. 1 iffy game shouldn’t determine fate, not when he  has been to 2 straight WS and lost to team that won 16 more games.
Red Sox main winter focus: bolster/remake pen. Top free agents are kimbrel, eovaldi, kelly, pearce
Eduardo Nunez plans to pick up his $5M option and stay with the World Champion Red Sox. (Player options are a good thing)
Stubby Clapp was hired by cardinals as 1B coach. Jeff Albert will be STL hitting coach.
All 3 clearly have TWTW https://t.co/X0FQaP2qCH
Mets new GM Brodie Van Wagenen makes his transition to the team tomorrow. Working at CAA today, press conference tomorrow.
David Price should have been co-MVP, at least. #WorldSeries
One GM estimate of the Manny Machado contract to come: $225M-$230M. That’s just 1 estimate, and it’s from a management person. (But it sounds like $100M less than earlier estimates, meaning before this postseason)
Never to early to ask about a team’s offseason focus. For Boston it can be summed up in one word: relievers. Kimberly and Krlly are the top free agents (along with World Series mvp Steve Pearce)
Justin Turner didn’t even like hearing the question about Roberts. Asked, “As players do you want Dave back?” JT responded, “that’s the end of the interview. Come on man. That’s stupid.” (My take: Ok to ask, but suggesting his job should be in jeopardy is stupid!)
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts received a lot of criticism for game 4 (including here). But kenley Jansen said, “to me it’s not fair.  Doc did a tremendous job this year.”
Manny Machado was asked about possibly coming back to dodgers and said, “we just lost. I can’t think about that.” (My take: can’t see any way he’s re-signed. He was just filling in for injured star Corey seager. Also, he’s believed to prefer east coast, especially the yankees.)
Never was there a more deserving champion. 14 reasons that made the Red Sox great https://t.co/ZvG0bJ3wcA
Steve Pearce is MVP
World Series winners: David Price, Steve Pearce, Nate Eovaldi, Alex Cora. World Series losers: Johnny Hustle and a couple others.
Congrats to the Boston Red Sox, a worthy winner if there ever was one. World Champs!
and the World Series ends at Chavez Ravine for the second straight year, with the visitor as champion
Chris sale induces 2 strikeouts on 2 of the worst swings ever. now Johnny hustle up for the potential final out.
Spiritual leader and alleged belly button ring aficionado Chris Sale in to close it out
Yankees suck chant breaks out. Presumably led by Red Sox fans (but dodgers fans probably aren’t arguing)
Major cheers for David Price as he exits with a 5-1 lead. Big Boston contingent here. He appeared to tip his cap (either that or he wiped his brow).
Steve Pearce is unstoppable. Two home runs today after a homer and 3-run double last night. 5-1 Boston.
JD Martinez joins the Boston party with a homer to dead center off Kershaw. 4-1 Sawx.
Mookie Betts finally strikes. You knew it was s matter of time for the AL MVP. HR off Kershaw makes it 3-1 Boston.

A deep dive into all the pitching moves gone awry, redone with Dave Roberts’ thoughts on hill, madson, devers and trump @Fancred @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/JjW3uRJPFA
Everyone should love Dave Roberts, but even considering his depleted pen he had a few head scratchers in Game 4. Here are four or so https://t.co/JjW3uRJPFA
He's a great manager, but Dave Roberts left plenty of room to question his moves in Game 4. My take from Los Angeles @Fancred   https://t.co/JjW3uRseO2
Parade of Red Sox fans are marching through the concourse. Their chant? “Let’s go Red Sox. Yankees suck!”
Pinch hitter Devers gives the red sox the lead with hit off Floro with s base open. Which means that the criticism will turn away from Cora, and go to Roberts instead.
Steve Pearce HR off Jansen in 8th  ties it. Dave Roberts will be hit for going away from the Baez for one, Jansen for one formula. Jansen for two has not worked two straight days.
Mitch Moreland 3-run bomb cuts LA’s lead to 4-3, Huge home run to match Puig’s shot. But there was less emotion for the combatants with this one. Moreland less demonstrative than Puig( big surprise there). And, unlike E-Rod, Maddon didn’t whip his glove to the ground.
Thunderous ovation for Rich Hill (aka Dick Mountain) as he leaves. I like to think it’s cause he hustled his ass off down to first but it’s probably because he threw a spectacular game: he leaves allowing 1 hit and no runs.
Cora is taking hits for leaving e-rod in the game to face. but Puig strangely enough has hit righties much better than lefties all year (100 points better), which is why he sometimes sat vs. lefties.
Puig your friend's 3-run home run sends dodger stadium into delirium. suddenly 4-0 dodgers.

there is optimism the extensions for the a's leading trio of billy beane, david forst and bob melvin will be completed soon. @JulianMack105 and @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned progress in talks. the gm forst turned down chances to interview with the mets, and crosstown with the giants.
@AmyTrask Ok thanks! I believe that’s free in the press box. Even better!
Nice touch: Dennis Eckersley throws out first ball to Kirk Gibson. Looked like a backdoor slider, too
Strange but true about dodger stadium concessions: the New England clam chowder is good, the nachos are gross. (You’d think it’d be the opposite)
Chaim Bloom remains 1 of 3 known candidates for #SFGiants gm job, along with Amiel Sawdaye and Jason McLeod. Giants tried for interviews with already established GMs Stearns, Forst and Chernoff but they are all staying in their current jobs.
The narrative that Fred Wilpon badly wanted an old scout running the Mets proved untrue. Of the final 10-12 candidates only 1 is known to fit that description. The top 3 candidates were all fine to enthused with analytics, which is necessary today
Brodie Van Wagenen’ title will be General Manager once deal is finalized. The outside the box candidate was Jeff Wilpon’s idea, but was obviously approved in the end by Fred.
Van Wagenen and Mets have a deal in principle for him to be the new gm. Just finalizing. (This time without autocorrect.)
Brodie Van Wagenen and the Mets are in agreement on the main parts of the deal to make him the new GM. Only crossing Ty’s and fitting I’d to go. @Joelsherman1 1st
Dodgers prevail in historic, must-win game to give themselves a fighting chance in World Series. But for them, a lot of work yet to be done. https://t.co/gAriYU3AWT
Nate Eovaldi doesn't deserve the loss. He deserves a Purple Heart,
Max Muncy wins it. finally. thank you, Max Muncy!
yes, someone is smoking weed in the press box. not to generalize, but I suspect the LA writers more than the boston guys https://t.co/azYG7BYO0I
Nathan Eovaldi is the savior for boston. has now pitched 6 innings in game 3 after pitching in game 1 and 2 (and has yet to allow an earned run). Logan White, who drafted him for the dodgers, has summed him up in 1 word: "gamer"
Clayton Kershaw is pinch hitting here in the 17th. didn't think I'd write that sentence.
after review, Puig has to stay on 1B. but more importantly, dodgers not dead yet. 2-all in 13th.
Nunez, injured, flies into the stands for the catch. like his old friend Jeter!
nate eovaldi, tomorrow's starter, enters for boston. at least he was supposed to be tomorrow's starter.
dodgers have 4 right-handed hitters still batting .000 in this World Series. this has been a problem.
was she mocking Craig kimbrel's pitching stance? not sure. that's what @HeidiWatney suggested, and it's as good a theory as any https://t.co/laMt7fk1Wt
@DWadeBsFan he is a better player. he does not have more raw power. nor does he have a stronger arm.
in terms of strategy, not sure we've ever seen any first-year manager as good as Alex Cora. ever.
@JGlatts1 I am ashamed you are from Long Island.
@brycekrisp that may be true. he does not have the arm strength of bellinger. check with any scout
@Ken_Saunders you should maybe ask someone who really follows the game. you must not
@Ted_Guglielmo @LightsOut_Nate didn't say he was better than mookie. he does have more raw power than rookie. and probably a stronger arm (tho not more accurate).
@Atmcbride trout doesn't have bellringer's arm. tho I wouldn't expect a casual fan to know that, you did just see that throw right?
@tomsa592 you are obvs an AL fan. and a rude one
@Finnereaux bellinger has more speed than judge anymore raw power than betts. u must be an AL fan
@JoanOfSnarque I will repeat. not all 3. (unless maybe u count octane's arm for pitching)
@edflynn thank you. didn't say he was better than mookie. bellinger has more. raw power tho
@LightsOut_Nate doesn't have bellinger's raw power.
there isn't a player in the game that can match bellinger for arm, speed and power -- not all 3 #tools
bellringer with a gun from medium center saves the dodgers' day. pinch runner kinsler out trying to tag, and not close.

No final decion for mets yet but focus appears on Brodie Van Wagenen. Negotiations have begun (but it’s possible they’ve started with Bloom too). Considering his major client list, BVW presumably would be among better paid GMs, assuming they work it out.

Girardi surprised reds by pulling out Friday. He had a chance to win job at that point but they never got to point of talking money with him. He also pulled out of rangers derby. Industry speculation: he’s waiting a year on Chicago

Orioles have indeed sought to interview Kim Ng. She's now been connected to all 3 open GM jobs.
Tom "Flash" Gordon, 22-year MLB pitcher, will be named director of community relations &amp; special advisor to the president of Perfect Game, the company that stages amateur baseball events for the top prospects. 11,000 MLB draftees, including 600 1st rounders, played in PG events.
Interesting that Orioles interviewed ex-Dodgers GM Ned Colletti this year and are looking closely at Kim Ng for GM. They were together in Dodgers front office. Could they be hired as combo?
Orioles GM search has been quiet to date but one name that’s just surfaced is Kim Ng. There is definite interest on O’s part.

Is the bullpenning grand experiment showing cracks for the @Brewers? After Game 2 late-inning letdown against @Dodgers, it's fair to ask.  @Fancred  https://t.co/4bEWA0wDjx
Yelich vs. Jansen, the way it should be, for the game
Justin Turner, Mr. October, makes amends for a rare rough day in Game 1 with 2-run homer that puts the dodgers up, 4-3. Jeffress finally breaks.
I'm not sure about this. but it certainly was weird ... and a very bad idea. sliding feet-first into 1st is absurd. not sure where he got that idea, but ne needs to lose it. https://t.co/x78wKukjsY
Jeremy Jeffress bends but he doesn't break. DP grounder by grandal keeps it at 3-2 crew.
brewers starter wade miley exits to a roar after 5 2/3 innings of 2-hit ball. that's equal to a complete game by brewers standards. crew leads 2-0.
Manny Machado should really try sprinting when he hits the ball in the ss hole. teams are watching.
Justin Verlander says he's ready for the 2nd half of his career. if that's true, he will be pitching til he's 48. and if it goes as well as the 1st half, have 408 wins.
@JamesBeach45 she was a terrible owner. do you that's political? you think she was good? and why would that be?
what she is recalled for: 1. being married to perhaps the worst owner in baseball history 2. making ridiculous and egotistical comments 3. giving up her stake in the dodgers for pennies on the dollar 4. "size zero" (h/t tj simers, who gave her the nickname) https://t.co/c9lYPnBg5Q

Brewers hang on to win 6-5. That’s 12 straight. Hamburgers for all.
OK, BK was right about everything: the opener, bullpenning, robo umps.  I give. @MrBrianKenny
dodgers half-game summary: they've committed 3 errors and have 2 passed balls, Kershaw was knocked out after 3-plus innings, they have 1 hit and have whiffed 7 times. #blue
Craig Counsell pinch hits for Babe Woodruff, and Domingo Santana lines a two-run hit to knock out Kershaw. the crew can do no wrong!
dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal is off to a rough start: 2 passed balls, a catcher's interference that erased a brilliant catch by david freese and another error. not so grand.

@Tedfulton52 Nice
chernoff has not yet interviewed for the mets job and the mets are unsure if he's coming in. potential coup but also potential complications, like he already has a gm job he likes. seems to be a possibility tho.
indians gm mike chernoff is said to be "getting hot" as a name that interests the mets. unclear if he'd go. already has a good job. but as mentioned here a couple months ago, he's from NJ. @martinonyc mentioned earlier today
@GRod1287 Sorry that your team’s defeat has put you in a bad mood
@BruceIsOnline it's in my head that he is. get back to me if im wrong (tho I did just say likely, which is a good word)
mookie betts, the likely al mvp, has moved with agents steve veltman and ed cerullo, who'd been at legacy but are forming their own agency. so betts will no longer be with legacy, either.
Talented reliever. Struggled at times in 2nd half https://t.co/14y0Em3ftb
Brad Ziegler retired with a twitter posting. Good reliever, better person!
angel hernandez did ok calling balls and strikes in game 4. but good thing he wasn't at first base or they would have had to end the game by overturning a wrong safe call. that might not have gone over well at yankee stadium.
Congrats to the Red Sox, who go to the ALCS. Quite a finish to beat Yanks in NY. 111 wins. Much respect.
not against hiring an inexperienced manager (Cora has been damn good). one thing I don't get is hiring an inexperienced manager, then giving him a bench coach that also never managed in the majors. like the yankees and mets both did. Cora got ron roenicke. better idea!
they need challenges on balls/strikes when angel's behind the plate
@YankeesCorazon didn't understand your first sentence. the second one was nasty, that I got. you're the 1 who knows apparently.
it seems a little odd the manager is being blamed when the yankees have been outscored 20-1 over a game and a half. sure, he should have gone to the pen a bit earlier at least last night. easy to criticize the skipper, but the real story may just be that the Red Sox are better.
Kevin Cash received deserved extension through 2024. Great job by him this year. Would be manager of year in normal year but Melvin and Cora were crazy good.
Dodgers take of business (like usual), but they’ll have to play to their potential to beat the brew crew https://t.co/tStpVBlwN8
great job by the braves to win the NL East. I never thought they'd do it this year. very bright future.
congrats to dodgers, who go to the NLCS. dodgers-brewers should be fantastic. great rotation vs. great pen. two amazingly deep teams.

@LordBobbyConner I laughed
ok, enough chopping. I don't mean this game. I mean ever. thank you.
Upon review, the review system needs work
Machado 3-run homer gives dodgers some breathing room. Finally. 6-2 LA.
David Freese, no relation to The Freeze (who won his race moments ago; big surprise), gives dodgers 3-2 lead with two-run hit.
very sedate celebration by Astros after beating tribe &amp; moving on to ALCS. they are champs. they are pros.
Marlins have let go pitching coach Juan Nieves plus 3 more coaches — Perry Hill (one of the better infield coaches) plus Frank Menechino and Ty Hill. @JoeFrisaro 1st

acuna becomes the youngest to hit a slam in postseason play. previous record holder: mickey mantle, 1953 World Series
Acuna delivers grand slam. braves have life. 5-0 lead early in game 3.
the braves have scored a run. 1-0. bases loaded 4-pitch walk to pitcher Sean Newcomb brings in the run. (I'd have pinch hit for Newcomb, shows you what I know). tomahawk choppers happy.

crowd going nuts as replay doesn't change out call on arcia. replay officials now 1 for 2. call "stands." why? because there was apparently a 1 percent chance the original call was right. silly.
replay shows arcia is safe at 1st. crowd erupts. lets see if replay officials get it right.
rockies tied it at 2 on 3 singles, an error and a sac fly. story up with 2 on and 2 out in 9th.
Blackmon pulls rockies within one, 2-1, with Colorado's 3rd straight hit in 9th off Jeffress. still none out.
replay saves brewers there. Blackmon's would-be game-tying double is overturned and ruled foul. looked 2 inches foul. so they got it right (on replay)
orlando arcia, starting for his fantastic defense -- he made a gem earlier from the hole -- lines a hit to right. brewers threatening with 1st and 3rd and 1 out, still lead 2-zip
Yelich, the likely mvp, drills homer to left center. rare to see someone this hot. crew leads, 2-0.
agents steve veltman and ed cerulo are starting their own agency. they recently left legacy, as @ByRobertMurray reported. clients they took with them 2 1/2 years ago from ISE to legacy: rookie betts, MadBum, many others

sources say Joe Maddon will be back for a 5th season as cubs manager next year. there is no discussion of an extension. neither side has broached the matter, so likelihood he enters 2019 as a lame duck (albeit a high-priced lame duck).

when it matters, the #SFgiants are fantastic. 3 World Series titles, all as an underdog. but as a spoiler, they are pretty pathetic. 14-0 dodgers.

Inside Baseball: 57 great manager candidates (icymi) https://t.co/Ex0LWKG9xc
of the 4 teams tied atop their division, cubs have the toughest assignment. st. louis is the best of the 4 would-be spoiler teams and their starter jack flaherty is really good. plus, word is the cards don't necessarily like the cubs.
nice ovation for pence in SF. pence and adam jones could be playing their last games for the giants and orioles, respectively. mauer and beltre are among stars who could be playing their last games in MLB.
christian yelich can win the triple crown. batting title all but locked up, he's tied for HR lead with matt carpenter in a tight race (others at 34 and 35)  and 2 behind Javier Baez for rbi title. (extra game could help too, though baez would play in that one, too, if necessary)
great day in baseball! cubs-brewers and dodgers-rockies battles go to game 162 today all tied. strong chance for a game 163 (or 2) tomorrow. 4 games to (maybe) decide things start now.
Notes, notes and more notes: callaway fate, Britton role, is it Kapler? Sale velo, Witt jr., snell’s big year, good fish deal, taillon, lorenzen the first? Scioscia, snitker, Mauer, beltre, happ, royals great pick, trout, Mookie, Verlander, much more. https://t.co/hBWxI5WUz8
brewers and cubs are now tied at the top of the nl central going into game 162 tomorrow. if rockies don't comeback (they are down 6-2 to the nats), they will be tied with the dodgers at the top of the nl west. should be some kind of finish tomorrow!
Better link fir my story on 57 great managerial candidates . Sorry! https://t.co/R7qYqtj9Fp
Clubhouse issues may not have helped mariners cause, and the Gordon/segura fight exemplified them https://t.co/AhLeeQgc7w

@BenAdamsO_O It’s not gambling the race is over
@jonbecker_ Plus the $1 originally wagered. $1.33
Those 1-3 odds bovada says it’s laying on degrom winning the Cy Young are ridiculous. If they are really willing to pay 33 percent on a degrom bet — and they assure me it’s real online — everyone who has an account there should bet on degrom. The race is over. He’s won.

goin on @JoeandEvan at noon for regular gig to discussing yanks, deGrom, wright and anything else they want to talk about @EvanRobertsWFAN
@BravesNY @Braves So absurd
the mariners have informed pat listach, their triple-a manager, and mike micucci, their director of minor-league operations, that their contracts will not be renewed
the braves let go Luis Salazar, 62, the longtime coach/manager who was managing the class-a Florida fire frogs, and some others as well. Salazar is the former big league player who lost an eye when he was struck by a foul ball seven years ago.
matt carpenter was called out on a pitch that looked about 8 feet outside, then got tossed by the umpire who made the worst strike call I've seen all year
things are getting dicey for the cardinals again. rockies have only home games left, and they look really good (of course most teams do while playing the Phillies)
@VinBonaccorso @Ken_Rosenthal Yes
Bases-loaded triple by Yelich makes it 6-0 over the cardinals and is yet another mvp statement. #brew #crew

Another great import coming from japan (icymi) https://t.co/LKJfXBWwQW

A late look at how close each of the 6 main awards are (but 1 of them is close to settled now!) https://t.co/WwyTa50EVS
Congrats to the braves, NL East champs. Terrific job. Played hard every day, didn’t waste opportunities. 26-9 vs. the mets and marlins.
Two observations: Raisel Iglesias is a very happy guy and it’s not an early-arriving crowd for reds-marlins https://t.co/hwWdkUxcFC
Adrian Beltre, with 1,703 rbi, just passed Reggie Jackson to move into 25th place all-time. also higher on the list than Schmidt, Brett and Chipper Jones.
Ender Inciarte is a winning player. Fantastic in center and on the bases.
One person outside the mets organization wonders if the gm hire might “set the organization back 25  years” if they go really old school, as rumored. Mets say, no worries, analytics will be considered https://t.co/oJ9CskkFOm

@MikeSchaefer298 lol. thanks for your unbiased opinion
@RicBracman96 down the stretch? he was a major factor when it mattered for Boston. these games don't matter for them
@campbell8212 @TonyC_34 his start today was only 3 innings. I said "even if" which only means if he comes up just short. I'd guess he gets to 162 but going to be close.
@BabeGhostof is that English?
if anyone deserves a salute, it's Jay https://t.co/7S58VOQvHk
@YourTimesUp94 How is this wrong? It is 200 percent correct. Perhaps You’d get the award if anyone saw your tweets
@StevePhillipsGM For the player to say the sides were not close, that shows he knew what the jays were willing to pay. That’s really the point. They did talk money and he had a chance to stay.
@StevePhillipsGM Point is, the player was told he could sign for about 75/3 or a little more. An offer doesn’t have to be formal or even in writing. To say otherwise is to rely on semantics which is silly and misleading. Sides discussed where they stood over days.
@SportTepidTakes Offered 64m, agent wanted st least 70. So no you must not have read carefully
How close did the O’s come to locking up Manny Machado? (Pretty darned close; the offer and the request are in here) icymi https://t.co/Jdhhe0WpXa

@JaredStillman No he won’t. You are right.
Of course the jays and Donaldson did talk money last winter, they did negotiate and they did know where each other stood, so the agent’s response about us was merely an attempt to obfuscate the reality https://t.co/IzsqPJAkhw

Bad umpire Carlos Ramos owes Serena an apology. And also all the fans who came to watch (me and my family included).
Naomi Osaka deserved it. She was the better player today. That said, I never want to hear that baseball umpires have egos that are too big. The umpire for this tennis match should retire ... permanently.
That’s a joke. Serena got robbed. #joke

@CouchCoaches21 @msargeant29 @KevinMcCune if anyone took this as an Attack on Ohio state they need reading lessons.  You r right it was only 1 person who read that as an attack. And why is that? Because it clearly was not.
@PorkchopTBP Instead of getting upset maybe suggest they change it? Could have been Oklahoma state. It’s not clear to some casual fans like myself. Just a suggestion. Why use acronyms for some and not others when there’s space to spell it out? Just a thought.
@holdenb75 @KevinMcCune He must be a REALLY big fan. I guess
@tmw930 @espn Why couldn’t some read that as Oklahoma state? 1B has only 2 meaning.
@brent_sactown1 Exactly!
@JVachon21 He’s fantastic
@msargeant29 @KevinMcCune Amazing right! How he saw that as an attacking on Ohio State is beyond me
@KevinMcCune Thankfully most of the rest of America can read. Just to clue u in: it was s light comment about ESPN. That’s it,
@KevinMcCune Go team
@KevinMcCune You may need to re-evaluate your life/priorities if you see everything in terms of: is it pro/con OSU (Ohio).

Thought I’d check college football scores on ESPN. The first one confused me for a second: OSU 77, Oregon St. 31 ... Isn’t Oregon State also an OSU? If you can fit Oregon St. why not use Ohio St.?

Just to make it clearer for all you wiseacres out there: the freeze has not been traded. He is still in Atlanta.
Dodgers infield looks rather crowded, having acquired Machado, Dozier and now David Freese. Freese brings another righty bat who hits lefties: .300 lifetime vs. southpaws
Pirates’ goal in these trades is to open spots for the kids — Kevin Newman and others
Hechavarria goes to yankees
Jesus Manuel Valdez, 20, who goes to pirates for Freese, is known for his athleticism and defensive versatility.
Pirates get Valdez for Freese
Freese to dodgers
Hard to remember now that Josh Donaldson has been traded for a ptbnl, he finished 1st, 4th and 22nd in mvp voting the previous 3 seasons. Reality: Gio was apparently worth more on this market, and mccutchen much more.
Brewers had also liked Ryan madson, but due to their respective records, dodgers got the claim. Brewers did a lot as is.
Granderson is traded to brewers for class a prospect
Yankees, cardinals and braves were among other teams that inquired about josh Donaldson before he went to indians
It is Harrison and Lara going to nats, as suggested earlier, for Gio
kJ Harrison, catcher and former Third rounder from Oregon state, is going to nats in Gio deal, confirmed. Not sure on rest of deal.
The Donaldson Derby 22 days ago. I should have re-read my prediction earlier today! https://t.co/HwWxowcgFz
Indians needed to lengthen lineup. If and when Donaldson is ready, they can move Ramirez to 2B and utilize kipnis in OF
Indians get Donaldson @JeffPassan 1st
Scouts like #SFGiants take for Cutch. De Paula is young (20) with a “big arm,” Avelino is a possible MLB starting infielder. And “at worst quality utility man”
KJ Harrison, a catcher, and Gilbert Lara, an infielder, were late scratches from minors game tonight, and are believed to be going to nats in the agreed-upon Gio trade with brewers. Kyle lobner mentioned the lineup change 1st
One reason jays have to trade Donaldson: they really can’t give him a qualifying offer. Off this year, he’d have to take it. And they can’t chance that. Vladimir Guerrero jr. will be their 3B at some point next year.
@MikePMoffatt Fair point
Several people in game have heard rumor Josh Donaldson prefers not to be traded. Probably won’t affect/ curtail interest but it’s something to think about, assuming it’s true (it should be treated as a rumor but has yet to be denied by anyone). Bottom line: he has no trade veto
Donaldson is the one obvious game changer out there ... if he’s healthy. Just a supreme talent. However, hasn’t played in big-league game since late May
Sources: Yankees are among teams talking to jays about josh Donaldson. Toronto would have to pay down the 4M to go by at least half. Yanks will absolutely not go over threshold. (They are thought about 2.8M under)
Brewers get their starter, Gio Gonzalez. Trade done.
Brewers are talking about Gio Gonzalez and Curtis Granderson, among others. @Ken_Rosenthal mentioned. Both cleared. Neither having best year but would provide veteran leadership. Gio may be best SP out there, too.
Just arrived in LA. Seeing the sights. https://t.co/32w6NeF0fp
Andrew Istler, a rhp who opened some eyes in spring of 2017 and has a 2.37 era in minors this year, including 5 2/3 scoreless at okc, goes to nats in deal. Duke product. @Joelsherman1 1st on AI
There are no active trade discussions involving future Hall of famer Adrian beltre. He hasn’t seemed anxious to leave, and has full no trade.
Madson is going to dodgers. Nats get a prospect. @Ken_Rosenthal  1st
Sources: josh Donaldson has cleared waivers and is eligible to be traded to any of 29 teams
Yanks are still about $3M under the $197M threshold, in case there’s anything else out there they’d like
@Enterprise pls follow for DM
#STLCards were interested in Donaldson in winter, they’ve been aggressive this summer (and r obvs in the thick of the race now) and 3B Jedd Gyorko is on the dl til sept. 8. Others teams like JD too tho. And stl isn’t desperate. With Matt Adams now, possible carpenter can play 3B
#SFGiants were already under the $197M threshold and are a little more under now (cutch trade saves them a bit over a mil)
Even after adding Ramos, Cabrera and Bour, the phillies are said to be looking at bats

DePaula is the other prospect going to SF, @JimBowdenGM 1st
Giants sent half the $ remaining on cutch deal to yanks to complete deal
Done deal: sfgiants get two prospects including avelino for cutch. There’s some money involved.

josh donaldson came through last night's game fine and is going on trade waivers today so he can be traded on Friday's waiver deadline. #STLCards and #Indians seem like logical spots, but sources suggest there are other teams showing some interest.
#STLCards apparently have quite a pipeline of managers in the minors. #stubby https://t.co/XuZdu7Z385
Josh Donaldson is playing/showcasing in Dunedin tonight, just in time for a possible trade. Still has 4M plus to go but upside obviously huge. Scouts will be there.
Mike Shildt deserves to be retained. @dgoold reports it’s a three-year extension, which is very fair. Mike Matheny still had 2 1/2 years and $5M-plus  to go when let go. @BNightengale also on Shildt story.
Disappointing news from mets. Alonso deserves a promotion https://t.co/gvQHbjLO7N
Braves extend Tyler flowers @fancred https://t.co/hvex93i9rj
Flowers wanted to stay with braves, and they love him on team. Extension doesn’t preclude braves from trying for Realmuto, a possible target
Flowers will receive a $4M base salary in 2019, and will have a $6 million option for 2020 with $2M buyout. so $6M guaranteed. #braves
Tyler Flowers has agreed to an extension for one year and a club option with #braves.
Jose Bautista talk said to be progressing between mets and Phillies. seems like a good sign since there's only minutes to go.
Happy 38th birthday Ryan https://t.co/6Rl8SVes5y
Josh Harrison, who’s day to day with a hamstring, has cleared waivers. Unpredictable pirates, more buyer than seller at the first deadline, could do some selling this time (maybe)
mets are telling Phillies that Jose Bautista isn't just a giveaway, that they won't let him go for nothing and they'll want a prospect back for him. understandable since his mets salary is the pro-rated minimum. @Ken_Rosenthal 1st reported that Phils got the claim on joey bats,

Sergio Romo, who could help a lot of teams, is said "not going anywhere." he was believed to have been on waivers earlier, so it seems likely he was claimed and pulled back.
yet another defining moment for Aaron Nola, who whiffs Harper with 2 on and 2 out in the 8th to preserve 2-0 lead. the year Nola's having isn't getting the attention it deserves.

@RichSm1978 I said what they did was expected. So not sure your point.
Trade for Billy Hamilton off his waiver claim is said to be “unlikely.” Makes sense since he is not a free agent after the year. As @ByRobertMurray said, BH was claimed by unknown team.
@KiethMessinger Yep
@michael_falanga Meyer
@jongrant30 Right
@ohio_sports18 Thanks for your unbiased opinion
@mattrph23 Go team
@nascarkenny Nice ad hominem argument. He was suspended 3 games so obviously Ohio state found wrongdoing. It is no longer an accusation to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention without blinders on.

Matt Harvey was indeed claimed on waivers by an unknown team. Doesn’t mean he will be moved. Unclear if the claiming team was doing it to block. @ByRobertMurray 1st

@Concur_21 Thank u
The Nats have underachieved so badly this year I am starting to wonder if in subsequent years we will be referring to the Curse of Dusty. I know this: no managerial firing ever was less deserved.
First with the news that the dodgers had won claim for dodgers was @granthpaulsen before he was pulled back by nats
Dodgers could have used Harper to replace a struggling Matt kemp and apparently would have been able to stay slightly below the 197M threshold w/Harper (they also blocked all their main competitors with the claim). No indications nats ever seriously considered dealing Bryce tho.
@FredKerber Congrats Fred! A job well done.
Give Dave his bag back! https://t.co/ctnP31l0hG
sources: waivers have expired on Bryce harper. he is staying with nats.
sources: nats get infielder Andruw Monasterio and cash or ptbnl for Murphy
source: Adams goes to cards for cash considerations
prospect Andruw monasterio is going to nats for murphy
matt Adams is going to cardinals @JeffPassan 1st
Daniel murphy is going to cubs in trade. @CraigMish and @ByRobertMurray were on it.
cardinals are in on matt Adams. could be deal with nats.

#STLCards, amazingly enough, can move into playoff position with a win today. There’s a justice to them and the A’s doing great, as those two teams pulled off one of the only trades in MLB history — the Piscotty deal — that was borne entirely out of kindness.

Jays hope is to start Josh Donaldson’s rehab next week, put him on trade waivers when he’s ready to play in majors and find a trade partner.

@GMorrisNE @aehardy80 @WokeZilla95 yes. for going along with trump. that's politics!
@LinNichols5 He seems to be doing ok
@TylerrSaid @jzenk42 I’m bored with this already. Hating the president is allowed. Funny that some of you don’t think so
@MoRings42 He’s anti trump which is protected free speech
@GreggHenglein @tanner_james16 @bmarinnns I think he did an excellent job, was very entertaining and insightful, not bland like many are. I find it funny that you’d guess (wrong I may add) at my motivation when you apparently are in the media.
@Boomers12 I don’t. I think Keith was excellent. How is that politics?
@PMikePollack You are talking about interactive squabbles? Lol. Who cares? Olbermanns public comments are protected by the constitution. Schilling  makes comments about whole groups of people.
@FanofKahne @Sodjacket That’s allowed
@PMikePollack Olbermann should not be compared to schilling. Olbermann only hates one person. Schilling hates whole groups.

@Sodjacket Yes he hates our president. That’s allowed hating groups of people is something else
@tpodoll1 @Wolfey13 Criticizing the president is protected by the constitution. I assumed everyone learned that in high school
@shawn_melvin He criticizes trump. That is not hate speech. That is speech protected by the constitution, even if it is hard and profane
@tanner_james16 You think olbermann’s dumb? That’s a funny take.

@crownroyal64 That too

@StayClassy1979 @Wolfey13 You are a very shallow thinker

@008_ocho @npthree lol. ok, while I agree, that's a little harsh.  but I agree!
@jruben702 Well that tops my silly mariners tweet. Oy that’s bad!
@greg_wren @jhr017 I didn’t say they weren’t dedicated. I said they are not competent. Anyway I do admire you sticking up for your friends. But as I said not one person disagreed and said they were good. Or even ok. They just said I shouldn’t criticize them.
@npthree @greg_wren @jhr017 The games I saw the catchers were great, the umps terrible. And if you think they were terrible due to fear of the catcher missing a pitch then that is truly laughable
@npthree @greg_wren Man now I feel bad. Cause the result is these kids gave to endure unfair rulings throughout the game. Maybe if there was pay on top of just expenses for the llws games and some oversight the umpiring would improve.
@greg_wren @jhr017 The catchers had no problem catching the pitches. The catchers were fantastic. There was nothing wrong with their physical ability as you suggest. As I said the issue was the umps. They were not good. And no one has disputed that.
@greg_wren They review it after the game. I didn’t say otherwise. I think there’s something noble sticking up for your friends. But here’s something you didn’t say ( nor did anyone else who responded): that these games were well umpired
@greg_wren I am getting that they are paid salary during the season but only expenses during the llws? Or r you saying they making zero pay umpiring and do it all year? I’ve always known umps to be paid by the league they work. But u seem to be an expert.
@greg_wren Are you saying these guys make no $ as umps? The umps I saw are not helping the game or the kids. Not sure what you mean by the benefit of the pitch tracker — the tv tracker is for the tv viewer, it doesn’t not benefit umpires. In fact it enables fans to keep score on the umps.
@RogueUmpire @dehrsam9 @SimplyAJ22 @fRITZ_crackers_ @Smarz26 That I agree with
@jhr017 Lol. That’s funny but the reality is the Umps in MLB games are on a whole other level. They r also judging 100 mph pitches and 90 mph breaking balls.
@greg_wren @npthree I am sure your hearts in the right place sticking up for your friends. I am also sure no ones getting rich umpiring amateur games. I am just concerned for the kids who must notice how terrible the umpiring is and wonder what’s going on.

@purcilly4 Any job is worth doing well, no matter how high the pay. The umpiring is so terrible there’s no justice for the kids.
@npthree I am concerned for the kids. They gave yo wonder why nearly every call is wrong. They should pick them based on ability if that’s the problem. As I said impossible to each kids not getting any justice.
@npthree Pretty clear they aren’t selected based on ability. They aren’t helping anyone by getting every call wrong. They’ve got to find better than this. Not fair to the kids!

Strange but true: New Albany wins, and New Albany loses. In quite a coincidence and one of the more confusing games on record, the teams that represented Indiana and Ohio in the LLWS are both from towns called New Albany. To clarify, Indiana beat Ohio.

There are advantages to moving players at the trade deadline: It gives teams a chance to see what younger talent can do. @BengieMolina1 told me @Fancred that's what @Cardinals just accomplished:  https://t.co/yjqzCHowH2
Nats didn’t learn from last October’s pickoff at 1B by Contreras. Soto now caught twice in one game. He’s amazing, but there are reminders: he is 19.
Contreras was not in the running lane. Ump made the right call, didn’t deserve that abuse he took. #nats, #cubs
Soto, Schwarber and Harper have all tried bunting vs. shift and with wind blowing in at Wrigley today. Love the idea, tho only Soto successful.

Josh Donaldson is to begin sprinting this week. The former mvp is an interesting August trade candidate. #jays
@cmgdrama @MrBrianKenny @DannyKnobler Agree
@MaxBabylon @Ken_Rosenthal @big_veee @MLBNetwork The idea that you know as well as Ken what’s going on because you watch angels games is, frankly, hilarious.
@MaxBabylon @Ken_Rosenthal @big_veee @MLBNetwork Ken had sources saying Scioscia is expected to step down. He worked the story and obviously spoke to people in the know. I’m not sure why anyone who can read thinks that’s just speculation. Perhaps you need to work on your reading skills.
@MaxBabylon @Ken_Rosenthal @big_veee @MLBNetwork It was a fine article by Ken. What you know about journalism couldn’t fill a thimble.

That last-pitch “strike” to Anthony Rizzo wasn’t even close. That’s the kind of call that could lead to robo umps. #angel
Goin on for regular spot with @mullyhaugh on @670TheScore in Chicago at 6:40 ct. cubs, Eloy, etc.
Greg Holland now in agreement on deal with Nats. @chelsea_janes 1st said in talks.
Eloy Jimrnez is putting a lot of pressure on Chisox to be called up. Hitting .376 in triple a. Looks like huge talent.
I like this picture. Also, this fellow is doing a helluva job. https://t.co/Wcgk6FhB26
Edwin Diaz is good
AJ Hinch may be the best manager going. So I’m not sure I get this talk of him being a coveted free agent this winter. If the astros don’t pick up the team option they hold on him for 2019 (or extend him), that would be the worst kind of malpractice.
Nats Just “lost” 2 good relievers. So they are working on this. https://t.co/83ibtjVI9Z
Don’t disagree Osuna deserves 2nd chance and to keep his livelihood. Disagree that WS champs should have traded 3 viable pitchers to give him chance with baseball’s 2nd best team. The talk of due diligence/information gathering is getting tiresome too. He accepted 75 game ban. https://t.co/SQ09NQoXLv
@JulianMack105 It’s much improved.

Nothing better than meeting with Bobby V at Bobby V’s. Come to Stamford — best sports bar on the East Coast. @DannyKnobler @Larry_Rocca @BobbyValentine https://t.co/h5JiiAbFOc
Here's why the Dodgers were the biggest winners at this year's trade deadline (it's more than Machado) on @Fancred:  https://t.co/k12o3GS7YR
In case you missed my take on this, the Astros can't say they have zero tolerance for domestic abuse if they took Roberto Osuna in trade. And they could have traded for someone else. I'm still stunned.  https://t.co/gNNk9FC3o7
Here's one for Cubs fans. @JennyDell_ and I had @miggymont26 on Inside Baseball on @Fancred last night. That 2016 team? "It was special"  https://t.co/N0rmjSDOXV
He had a pretty good game last night (so did most of the Red Sox), and an even better catch earlier this week. Is @JackieBradleyJr the best defensive CF in baseball? Here's my case from Inside Baseball @Fancred:   https://t.co/3YV28wSn4f
Last night on Inside Baseball on @Fancred, I asked Scott Boras whether @Bharper3407 could give Nationals fans optimism he'll be there next season. Here's what he said:   https://t.co/VUF0u9jCcf

Are you counting the fact that Reyes balked on every single pitch when runners were on but umpires obviously took pity on him? Close call! https://t.co/75CBWudOvU
Johnny Cueto’s Tommy John surgery is said to have gone well. No word on whether there’s any possibility he could be back very late next year, but 2020 for sure.

Inside Baseball: how the teams did at the deadline, 1 to 30 https://t.co/o4uXaba6RK
the mets need a little work on their defense
Catching up on credit missed: @jcrasnick 1st on Diekman @ByRobertMurray on Leonys @JimBowdenGM on meadows/Glasnow @Ken_Rosenthal on dozier and other stuff. Apologies to others missed
Nice marlins story: up to replace Cameron Maybin is Isaac Galloway, who is in his 11th year in pro ball, all in the marlins organization.
The Pirates are the surprising big movers on this trade deadline day. From @Fancred (you can follow and chat with me on the Fancred App, too)  https://t.co/dl1ACh5dKD
O’s saved $35M with the deals. That’s a lot of money
the O's also get $2.5M international bonus bucks in big deal with braves
O's get Jonathan villar and jean carmona with Luis Ortiz for schoop
marlins are all done. ziegler and maybin went, bour and Dietrich stayed.
Jonathan schoop goes to brewers
tigers had no further moves. so fires and others stay.
source: Matt Harvey was not traded
mets kept their 4 vaunted starters
rays get meadows, Glasgow and ptbnl (player of real value) for archer. pirates addd a big piece.
Axford goes to dodgers for Copping
Jake diekman goes to the dbacks @jcrasnick 1st
remember, Chris archer has that great contract, with 2 team options, for 2020 and '21 https://t.co/fVsT5ParJJ
orioles have been talking about Jonathan schoop in deals. still working.
pirates now have a deal for Chris archer. big move by them!
forsythe , raley and smeltzer go to twins for dozier
dozier goes to dodgers, as @Ken_Rosenthal and @TheAthleticLA reported. they have quite the infield.
sources: braves have deal for gausman
sources: #SFGiants have entered the fray for matt Harvey
sources: pirates are moving closer to a deal for Chris Archer
as things stand now: braves may lead on gausman, pirates on archer (h/t @Joelsherman1). that could Harvey could wind up with brewers.
braves determined to add a starter, have been working hard on many fronts, including Kevin Gausman. would be a good get for them. rockies and brewers are among others involved.
sources: wilson ramos' deal to the Phillies is close
mariners get Cameron maybin for a prospect and international $. @ryandivish 1st
teams are showing signs of getting serious about Kevin gausman. rockies, braves, brewers are among teams interested.
a trade for zack wheeler seems to be increasingly unlikely. mets not hearing what they want to hear. market limited for joey bats, nonexistent for mesoraco. #mets
ziegler, for family reasons, was hoping to go to the midwest. but he was a d-back 2011-16 and has great relationships there, including with head guys derrick hall and ken kendrick. a friend said "as good as he could have had in the West"
pirates (full of surprises) are said to be heavy on archer. braves, brewers, maybe dodgers others in mix, as @Joelsherman1 and @Ken_Rosenthal said
sources: brewers and cubs are among main teams in mix for matt Harvey. (not likely braves, I am told).
told that, at this moment, talks regarding Realmuto are "nonexistent" #marlins
marlins aren't done, and are talking to teams about dietrich and bour
pitching prospect tommy eveld goes to Miami for ziegler @nickpiecoro 1st
Phillies are talking about Wilson Ramos from the Rays, as @JeffPassan said
guys on the desk are right. keeping bryce harper may be a "tell" that they badly want to keep him. @MLBNetwork
