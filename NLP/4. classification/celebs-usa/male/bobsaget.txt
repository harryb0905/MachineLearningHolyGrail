I’m so embarrassed – I don’t know how, but I got my penis stuck in the shower drain of the hotel I’m in. Never underestimate the power of shower gel. #freedom
I got a flu shot yesterday and it really works.  I have the flu today.
At the end of a long hard day it’s really nice to have a short soft night.

Does anyone know of a master class online where they teach you to play the piccolo with your butt?
I don’t wanna brag but my butt has perfect pitch.
What I care about most is the health of myself, my wife, and my children. I also care about the health of all of the good human beings on this earth. Oh, and I’m really into birds.
My penis has never told me his political party, but he’s always seemed to lean to the left.
My wife just taught me that it’s okay NOT to talk during sex.
“We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now.” ~ Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
One thing I’m really not happy about is how much I complain.
My midlife crisis is sixty years long.
When it comes down to it, having the people in your life that you love healthy— Well, it’s just the whole damn thing.
I always feel like I say the wrong think.

Dave, loved being your’s and David‘s Uber driver last night and thank you for the five stars. I think you were right, I’m a Livertarian. Just trying to protect my liver. https://t.co/G31ZpsliTr
Yeah, we are still hanging out at @FullerHouse #Season4, currently running @Netflix - Glad so many people love the show. https://t.co/5Nk5sV5QyW
@AlbertBrooks My deepest sympathies to you and Bob’s entire family. I loved your brother and had some truly fun and hilarious times with him. So sorry for your loss of the wonderful Bob Einstein.
Sending you all lots of positive wishes – – Cut out the negative – – And here’s to a happy and healthy New Year for us all. Except liars and people who don’t clean up their dog’s poop.
One of my new year’s resolutions is to become more PC and stop the dick jokes. I will concentrate on more penis and wiener jokes so as not to offend anyone, especially someone who goes by the name Dick. Apologies to all the Dicks out there.
I’m so happy to be having some private time with my wife, offline, just me and her, sharing our privacy with no one. Whew.
We should treat each other every day like we do on Christmas Day. We should expect presents and huge amounts of food to overeat and then ask our drunk cousin Larry to leave.
Maybe it’s the season, but I’m feeling that through all the negativity of 2018 will come positive. Sending love to all those hurting. Happy Holidays everyone.
Oh wait, if the government is shut down, can I still buy stamps?
With sex… If you come in second you’re the winner.
So happy to hear people are loving #Season4 of @FullerHouse - This is one talented group of peeps. And by “peeps” I don’t mean those yellow marsh-mellow little chicks candies. I mean these actors and friends I’ve had four of for like 30 years. @Netflix https://t.co/9zSUvIQ9rN

There’s always room for flan.
Be good to someone today. Even if you’re married to them.
It doesn’t matter what people think of you. It only matters what you think of yourself. That is of course as long as you’re a good person and not a slimeball.
Ahhh, fun memories with my brothers. And a lot more to come… @DaveCoulier and the ageless @JohnStamos 🚶🏻‍♂️🚶🏼‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/bnmyV8bL9E

It’s too late to be tweeting, so I’m gonna wait till 3 AM so I can make some real sense.
It’s hard out there for a pimp. But it’s harder for the people who have to work for the pimp.
When someone you love is hurting, the best thing you can do to help them is to stop insulting them.
We need to end the division and multiply the positive and subtract the negative and just get rid of square roots altogether.

This daylight savings time is awesome! It took me the hour I gained to reset all my clocks. Woohoo!
Don’t ever stay at a hotel called the “Slip It Inn.” Just sayin’.
Before the show tonight a couple guys in their 20’s told me I was the GOAT. I thought that was so nice I head butted them.
“I got, I got, I got, I got Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA.”
I am so proud of my daughters. (The TV ones, sure) But in life- my three amazing brilliant young women that I’m so proud to be the father of. That’s what I’m thinkin’ about today instead of the state of the world— ‘cause they are its future.
Had so much fun tonight with my brilliant friend @EricIdle talking about life and his new NY Times best-selling book “Always Look On #TheBrightSide “ at #FrostAuditorium in Culver City, CA. You’ve got to read this if you love comedy, Python, and Eric. https://t.co/d7WPGgxdlo
Had a great time guesting on @SHO_Shameless which airs this Sunday the 14th at 9pm @Showtime with @stevehowey &amp; @shanolahampton and @WilliamHMacy -My part btw was also shameless. https://t.co/9N7rTsXT3Z

It’s great to be back on Twitter after a much needed break. It was only for an hour, but I’m completely refreshed. I appreciate you all so much more now. Have a great day and don’t step in poo.
After a lot of thought, I’ve decided to take a well-needed and I’m sure somewhat appreciated break from Twitter. See you guys when next we tweet...
It’s gotten to the point where I’m afraid to tweet anything that could offend some negative lying wart covered hideous gnome who lives in a tree stump. #vote
I just landed in Paris and I can’t wait to oui oui.
I just ordered a pepperoni panini at an airport in Sicily and I think he misunderstood me cause I just spent a half hour with the guy in the men’s room. 🤥

Loved being a talk show host suspected of murder on Ep 6 of #TheGoodCop —A great new show that just premiered Season 1 @Netflix starring my super-talented friend @JoshGroban &amp; the legendary @TonyDanza - The EP I’m in is- “Did the TV Star Do It?” Impossible. https://t.co/hg19qdConh
Deep thanks to the amazing audience @lsqtheatre last night for welcoming me so graciously to my first time performing in London. And to the hilarious brilliant friends who kindly vouched for me: @EricIdle @jimmycarr @billburr @jimjefferies @RealMattLucas https://t.co/dvHdtGu8Ws
Don’t miss #TheGoodCop a wonderful new TV show that premieres today @Netflix starring my friend @JoshGroban &amp; @TonyDanza &amp; written by AndyBreckman. All Season one’s ten EPs are great, and FYI- I guest in Episode 6 as a suspect in “Did the TV Star Do It?”
Loved having lunch with my friend @jimmycarr while in London the day before my show @lsqtheatre - What a sweet, smart, talented man he is. I want to be like him when I grow up. https://t.co/dv6kmrkT4P
Had fun doin’ the podcast of my pal @itsJoshPeck - Hope you enjoy.  https://t.co/qLfIMd9l9S

My mind state feel like the crime  in the summertime Higher than average Lot of cabbage. ~ J. Cole
I think Siri is out to get me.
I would never want an edible strain of pot named after me. I don’t want people I don’t know eatin’ me. I got a woman -nobody else should be doing that stuff.
I’m not a weed smoker, but there are numerous strains of “Bob Saget  Sativa.” Do I try to sell it as merch at my shows? Better yet, give portions of the proceeds to charities supporting rehab centers? Or just be honored I have pot named after me? 🤔
Everyone we ask always knows exactly where they were September 11th, 2001. We will never forget it, our hearts will always hurt for the victims and their loved ones, and it must never happen again.
Fun night last night presenting at Creative Arts #Emmys @TelevisionAcad with Mi televisión Familia from @fullerhouse @NetflixUK @MSTheater 30 years of lovin’ these peeps. @JohnStamos @andreabarber @candacecbure @LoriLoughlin https://t.co/OPf17HxM0e
I don’t mean to brag but I have seven toilets in my house. Every night I play Game of Thrones.
Hope you all are having a good Labor Day. I wonder if anyone is in actual labor right right now, and if you are, I trust it’s an easy delivery and you took the drugs.
Your friendship and loved ones are only as good as your Instagram feed.
You should never have sex with someone’s ear. You could give them hearing aids.
It’s a good day to hug someone you really love. Preferably, they know you.
Senator John McCain. Rest In Peace.

Can’t wait to watch this show @Netflix with my super talented friend @joshgroban and the legendary @TonyDanza Created by the wonderful Andy Breckman creator, producer, and writer of #MONK https://t.co/h9OVeA2F2H
I ate dinner the other night in a rough neighborhood. Ordered a Caesar salad and the waitress asked me if I’d like some fresh ground pepper spray on it.
So upset by the news and the state of the world, I’ve been binge-watching shows to take my mind off the negativity— A Handmaid’s Tale, Westworld, Stranger Things... I sleep so much better now.
Been researching octopuses. Found out they only have 6 tentacles, and the other 2 are actually legs. With further research I found out those legs are actually testicles. So they walk on the balls of their feet if you will. #funfact
I’ve lost two sisters, so on this Sunday night I’m just saying if you’re lucky enough to have siblings you love, let them know, and spend as much time with them as you can.
If you plant your boogers, do noses grow?
Be cautious of anybody who tells you they’re a really good person all the time, as it might not be the case. BTW, I’m a really good person.

Thinking about Robin Williams today as a lot of us are. I always wonder why we have to lose so many good people too soon and other crawdads are walkin’ around pooping up the world. Maybe one day it’ll make sense.
FUN last night w/ @fullerhouse family directed by @DaveCoulier -Love these people. @candacecbure @JodieSweetin @andreabarber @LoriLoughlin @juanpablodipace @EliasHarger @_michaelcampion @HagenB00 @Soni_NicoleB Help, I woke up today thinking I’m Danny Tanner. https://t.co/pPzHJwghCy
I had a dream last night and all of you were in it.
My internet was just out for 24 hours- so I had no cell phone, no television, no smart house. Turned out to be an especially romantic evening. And my fianceé was there too!
Laughter can heal. It’s true! My friend Dave Coulier had a hemorrhoid and I laughed into his ass and he’s totally fine now.
The promoter from my London show @lsqtheatre asked me if my new standup was political. I told him “no.” but I talk about my penis a lot and he leans to the left.  https://t.co/RYgrkyNdPS

When people make you feel shitty just consider the source… They’re bitter caramel apples and you are a lovely sweet fresh peach. 🍑
It was 115° today. I gotta start taking my temperature orally.

I don’t understand why many don’t know that people are just people. We are all like M&amp;Ms. We may all be different colors but you can eat all of us.
Are people who always say “My heart goes out to...” ultimately heartless? My heart goes out to them.
Part Two or Part One, however you look at it, of my @AuntyDonnaBoys Interview podcast. Had fun with these talented gents.... https://t.co/rAzx4G9TkQ
My fiancée has a crush on Chris Hemsworth. I gotta be honest, I’m a little bit thor about it.
Life’s a big bowl of cherries. That includes the pits.
Happy Father’s Day everybody! I’m so lucky to have all of you as my kids. It’s true. Ask your mothers.
We have to care about all human beings. And while we’re at it, maybe care about some animals… Oh and some trees…
I turned off the news early last night. If I want to hear that much yelling before I go to sleep, I’ll just open my window and listen to the neighbors.
Here’s that podcast with @AuntyDonnaBoys I was talkin’ about... https://t.co/n8dFVUkV32

Dammit, I missed National Sex Day yesterday. Now I have to wait to have sex till next year. 😫
My butt has perfect pitch.
Sometimes I still wonder... What ever happened to predictability? The milk man, the paper boy, the evening TV? How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me please This old world's confusing me.
I am feeling very presidential today. I just passed wind and I pardoned myself.
So happy to be directing this documentary about one my idols, the brilliant comedian, musician actor, and through it all, amazing artist, Martin Mull. All thanks to our Producer and friend, Kevin Bright aka: @kbrightELA https://t.co/7NQoUFGB3q
I just witnessed a woman say to her son “Put your phone away” and he’s three years old. Maybe he was calling his dealer. Kids grow up so fast these days.
Back on the couch with these wonderful people who I love. Here comes @FullerHouse Season 4. Get excited. @netflix @netflixuk @Netflix_CA and every other #Netflix https://t.co/3vefpjA4em
There just is not enough love in this world. However, I hear there is a lot of love around Uranus.
The size of your penis is not important. The size of MY penis is extremely important.
When you have those you truly love in your life there’s no need to pay attention to those who aren’t even capable of love. Names to follow...
I’m so ashamed. I had a three-way with Siri and Alexa last night.
We all need to laugh. But there’s less to laugh at with so much pain and injustice in the world. So people resort to cruel comedy- which can shine a light on truth. But I prefer comedy mixed with love. Like hugging someone and simultaneously your pants drop.
Enjoying this Sunday just lying on the couch all day. And people are so nice here at this Pottery Barn, they haven’t asked me to leave yet.
I just wanna entertain people on here. It’s so frustrating to be misunderstooled.
On the flipside of things, I can’t wait to see Meghan Markle’s dress. I’m sure it will give me ideas of what I should wear to my wedding.
My deep sympathies to the students and their families and friends at Santa Fe High School. We must do something NOW to protect our kids. We are years late.
Thank you all so much for your incredibly kind and loving birthday wishes. Sending them right back to you all. My dearest came from my youngest daughter who told me I was a “treasure.” I hope I’m not kidnapped by pirates tonight.
What does it mean if instead of hearing “Laurel” or “Yanny” all you hear is the word “penis?”
So many things are trending now and everybody has opposed opinions— I don’t know whether my doorbell is going ding-dong or dong-ding.
It’s a new week! Let’s crush this week and and and teach this week a lesson and... save the environment and help those in need!! 😳 Oh crap I just lost some of you. Well, in any case, wishing everyone well even though things are tough for a lotta people.
My attitude towards life is my blood type. B positive.
Missing you @DonRickles so much on your birthday today. Funniest, sweetest most loving friend. https://t.co/yrtX6k7fdm
Treasure all people. Even if they have done you wrong. And by “treasure” I mean, put them in a chest and drop them to bottom of the ocean.
I am pretty upset thinking about chickens today. What the hell kind of soup do they eat when they get sick?

I can’t decide whether to order in North or South Korean food tonight.
Man, it’s really hard to say anything without people arguing over it these days. Can’t we all just agree it’s wrong to BBQ your Grandma?
I’ve decided to cancel my family trip to Westworld this summer ‘til they get things back to normal.
Happy Earth Day. It was created in 1970 to help raise consciousness and start to clean up the earth’s environment. I wonder if someone will pass a bill to discontinue celebrating it, because obviously the environment has never been better. 😳
A few years back @SnoopDogg sent me this on his app. Happy 420 everybody. https://t.co/msOgQRq3E0
Maybe the problem is- We are all called the “human race” -like we are competing against “other humans.” Maybe none of this dissension would exist on earth if we were all just “humans” with no “race” involved. Just pitching.

I just figured out after thirty years why Full House was so popular. It had a lot of love in it. And still does with Fuller House. And man, as Burt Bacharach and Hal David said, “What the world needs now is love sweet love...”

Our new history books are going to have a lot of *asterisks* in them.

First New Year’s resolution: Try not to be difficult first thing in the morning, then in the evening, and, oh yeah, most of the day. Happy new year good people.
Wishing everyone a very Happy New Year! And as a father, I want you all in bed by 11:55.
As a year ends, we all share the feeling that comes upon us, of who matters in our lives. You know who you are. And thank you.

It’s a good time of year to forgive and forget. Two of the three F’s. I’m trusting in 2018 we can forget about the things we’ve had to forgive. And respectfully F all the negative stuff and move Forward. Yay. There’s four F’s! #forward
What I learned on tour this year is—There’s a lot of good people out there. So I guess what I’m saying is, if you like my stand-up, you’re a really good person.

People need to laugh and I need to enable that.
Sorry if I occasionally offend anyone with my tweets, but sometimes they get misconscrewed.

Made the mistake of flying into LaGuardia and my car couldn’t pick me up so I’m in a cab with a nice couple. She’s a 3rd grade teacher &amp; he’s in advertising. His favorite movie is “Dirty Work,” so now I got new besties. #sharingiscaring
We all need to work on surrounding ourselves with good positive people. Out with the negative and in with the positive. Unless you’re charging your car battery in which case be sure you got the right clamps connected. ⚡️
Thanks to the great audience and people of Calgary last night. My show was so much fun @GreyEagleResort Event Center. Should’ve worn my white hat/key to the city I got years back from the Mayor. https://t.co/P8fRikMisY

I must believe that those who spread negative, hurtfulness to this world will slowly diminish and the kind and loving will band together as one.

My girlfriend just made me the best home cooked chili. Hope she doesn’t mind getting a whiff of it at 2 AM.  👃🏼💨
A really good friend is one you talk to on the toilet.
Fear is contagious. Don’t let scared people spread it to you.
I woke up today with an overwhelming feeling of positivity. Then, as I went off to work, I kissed my girlfriend goodbye and told her to protect our borders.

I just looked in the mirror and said to myself, “No more negativity.” And then I also said, “And you gotta stop talking to yourself in the mirror.” Baby steps.

Life is so excruciatingly hard for so many. We must stop the hatred. Stop the negative. Sending love and healing to Vegas and everywhere.

Soon as OJ gets out he should go straight to the White House and do what he does best – Help mend racial and NFL tensions.
It’s pretty tough respecting a dude who eats a Big Mac a day and tweets negative stuff at 3am on the crapper. But enough about me.
Motivational thought for the day – – Be nice to everyone you come in contact with. Unless they purposely fart and then creepily demand eye contact afterward, or worse, during.
Hugh Hefner’s definition of obscenity: “Racism, war, bigotry, but sex itself, no. What a sad cold world this would be if we weren’t sexual beings...I mean, that’s the heart of who we are.”

My Amazon orders arrived this morning. I think I've thrown my back out. Cases of baked beans are heavy.
My heart is with everybody in Florida. All my relatives, all my friends ...everybody.
In the future, all major government officials should be required to have been on a reality show. 2020 should be the year of Honey Boo Boo.
When people call me out and say I make "goofy dad comments" I'm flattered. So much better than abusive dad comments which come from meanies.
Even when things seem impossible or tough, we have to somehow not just hope, but trust. Vote no on negativity.

You can't always get what you want  You can't always get what you want  But if you try sometimes you just might find  You get what you need.
It's so wonderful waking up in the morning next to someone you're crazy about. The bummer is when they have a restraining order against you.

Anyone who care about humanity knows it doesn't matter what language you speak. All that matters is the size of your penis.

It's very difficult to get a coyote to stand still to get his urine to throw at a raccoon in your yard. Thank you all tho for the feedback
...now the raccoons in my yard are acting out a scene from 'eyes wide shut'...   The coyote urine is not working...
i have a bunch of raccoons in my yard. they were made to look like theyre always doing something wrong. theyre rolling my lawn like a blunt.
@JohnStamos my birdie's excited for you. You're taking over for Dick Van Dyke. An honor, and the best three part name in showbusiness.
