@MattOswaltVA They seem to miss a lot. Was Stanley Donen in there?
Looking forward to this. Welcome. #WithRefugees https://t.co/3WEBckgvOR
#StanleyDonen directed some of the most iconic, classic films of the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs...#OnTheTown, #SinginInTheRain,#Charade #TwoForTheRoad.  What an important director in the history of American movies. #RIP

@bern_hogan I‚Äôll take it under consideration! Thank you!
@bobhardt @bern_hogan I think anyway to bring these issues up is important, even having random celebs :) While I‚Äôve been in the refugee area with UNHCR &amp; education in Haiti, I took an interest in the turning of the state house and congress during election due to our current administration‚Äôs policies.
@bobhardt @bern_hogan Can‚Äôt a New Yorker support a voting rights bill? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs semi  random at all.
@bern_hogan I was there to support the bill as a New Yorker, which Andrew Gounardes helped pass and ran on as part of his platform, who I canvassed for and supported in the election.
@ZackFinkNews @NYGovCuomo It‚Äôs just too powerful. Wouldn‚Äôt be prudent.

@CetaceanFreedom @SHOLtdSeries @PattyArquette @MrEricLange @IAmMikeBeasley Good question. It was just that the new CO was from another prison and he was more by the book, not as lax as previous COs. Tilly was always dressed inappropriately but never called out on it.
He would switch to red in areas where the light might leak or be seen. This came from talkijgvwith Sweat himself.   #EscapeAtDannemora https://t.co/E2P7xWY4yV

I‚Äôll add we never put in anything that wasn‚Äôt based on a real occurrence. Almost every other detail in 3 is real, including sweat breaking  through 2 brick walls, the methods of cutting through cells at rec time and Lyle confronting Matt in the tailor shop.
Good question. No. Matt actually traded porn to help cell mate move. But inmates who knew him told us he was feared and had done other things like this. We wanted to show his menace, which was real, and this type of ‚Äú burn out‚Äù was a real prison occurrence.#EscapeAtDannemora https://t.co/c4jGmvI0VT

@rpharl awesome "?"
@rpharl is that a "pivot"? Alright I guess we'll see what happens...
@Matchpack ok. I'll just keep my fingers crossed he doesn't follow through with any of his campaign promises...
@rpharl so we just have to trust the guy who won't release his tax returns?
@rpharl ok. Then what... he stops talking to his kids?
@rpharl all for the positive but the legality of it is what is disconcerting. He even joked about it not being blind in a debate. Tough one
@adrigxo sure tweet @katiepruitt she'll handle it!
Watching @maddow breakdown how clearly a "blind trust" cannot be run by your children. Especially if they're on the transition team. #uhy

This could be my favorite thing ever. #Hooper #Respect https://t.co/9JakjJMoCA
@KLomangino My message is that over treatment and early detection are not mutually exclusive. One should discuss the test with their doctor.
@KLomangino You might note the PSA test never killed a person and all the negative side affects come from over treatment or other tests. üëç
This is awesome. #DayoftheGirl https://t.co/4SdVRmFjMd

@CaulfieldTim The takeaway message to discuss options with your doctor? Why is that not a good thing? I'll stop now. All the best!
@KLomangino Understood. But as a patient it is a different perspective. We need to be more proactive to learn options. Complicated issue.
@HealthNewsRevu Please read my piece again. I urge patients to discuss the test with their doctor and learn about it. Then make a choice.
@KLomangino @CaulfieldTim @VinayPrasad82 @HealthNewsRevu Sorry you disagree. Cancer screening should be a patients informed choice.
@picardonhealth  Hi Andre. My advice is ask your doctor about the test and make your decision. It's a patient's responsibility. And choice.
@DrRichardBesser Thanks for discussing on the air. The piece I wrote on https://t.co/gp6p96d7tc gives a fuller picture than the sound bitesüòä

Mugatu is named after a Star Trek creature. Hansel is named after a young German boy who hunts witches.
We actually shot this in New Jersey which is why it is placed there.
Scrappy and Luke Zoolander seem like they should have their own movie.
Notice the bone on Maury's desk for no other reason than to be there for the 2001 moment later.
My wife is the voice of the women Maury tushy squeezes... which is weird.
Will going "mm-mm" makes me laugh
Funeral scene... first day of shooting!
To make it less graphic...
Originally we showed the models burning in agony for a while but people were grossed out... and then we added the frappucino...
Guy reading the magazine is Herbie Lieberz a great Teamster legend!!
Gas station shot in Tribeca...now a building there... #AskZoolander
Probably Drake Sather. He wrote the original Zoolander sketches and invented the character. https://t.co/IcFs1oBGVN
Hansel is the original Victoria's Secret angel
Also we shot these scenes during commercial breaks of the live  awards..
Not my father's actual chest hair.
@somejerrystahl interviewing Derek about Hansel...
We were banned in Malaysia for this film.
My Mom egging Mugatu!!
@McConaughey got his "Alright Alright" from Hansel. Fun fact.
Stole these interviews at VH 1 Awards...
@pattonoswalt photobombing...
Nora Dunn in the Wintour-esque wig...
The opening scene was a reshoot after we finished the movie because no one knew what was going on in the movie when we screened it...
