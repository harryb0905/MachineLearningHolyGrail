So many bright colors, which one is your favorite? #NandJByDesign
Now I‚ÄôM crying...so thankful &amp; grateful for my family. #NandJByDesign
Those dance moves say it all #NandJByDesign
Why do I always have to deliver the plot twist, @JeremiahBrent? #NandJByDesign
Carrie Bradshaw meets The Jetsons... she loves it! #NandJByDesign
Sherry loves color ‚Äì so we‚Äôre going to learn to love it too! #NandJByDesign
Feels like a good start...hope we can finish the rest of the house #NandJByDesign
@JeremiahBrent‚Äôs enthusiasm gives me life üí• #NandJByDesign
Alright, it‚Äôs $40K - let‚Äôs see what we can do! #NandJByDesign
It‚Äôs time for us to take care of Sherry. #NandJByDesign
Minimal color is our typical style - this is going to be a challenge for both of us. #NandJByDesign
I love how Sherry wants to honor her childhood home #NandJByDesign
@JeremiahBrent cool your jets, we‚Äôve been surprising people all season! #NandJByDesign
We are so thrilled to be able to help Sherry &amp; give her back the house she grew up in. #NandJByDesign

Not going a penny over budget was a miracle #NAndJByDesign
We are LIVING for this moment! #NAndJByDesign
This is just the start of happier memories for the Saeedy family. #NAndJByDesign
Turning nothing into everything. Now that‚Äôs special. #NAndJByDesign
Absolutely priceless. So happy to see this reaction from Azadeh &amp; Mohsen! #NAndJByDesign
My nerves were an 8/10 on this reveal day. How do you think it went? #NAndJByDesign
Our goal was to create a space that the whole family could thrive in once again. #NAndJByDesign
And now for my favorite part... REVEAL DAY! #NAndJByDesign
The hunt for the leopard print pillow continues! #NAndJByDesign
That leopard print... feels like a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with @JeremiahBrent #NAndJByDesign
Dinner parties in the master bathroom? Oy, no. #NAndJByDesign
Design tip: save money and go for ceramic tile. Gorgeous &amp; affordable. #NAndJByDesign
I really hope they like what we‚Äôve done...stay tuned! #NAndJByDesign
STRESS FACE #NAndJByDesign
SURPRISE! We‚Äôre doing their entire house! #NAndJByDesign
Successful design meeting ‚úîÔ∏è #NAndJByDesign
What do you picture for the Saeedys‚Äô ‚ÄúNew Traditionalist‚Äù style? #NAndJByDesign
Toddlers have the best timing. Really. #NAndJByDesign
Design meeting? Pretty party? Whatever you want to call it, we can‚Äôt wait to get a better sense of their decor style. #NAndJByDesign
Warm, livable, functional, and comfortable... We‚Äôve got this! #NAndJByDesign
You read my mind @JeremiahBrent... I love a good bookcase. #NAndJByDesign
I believe a home is a vessel for stories &amp; memories. #NAndJByDesign
Bare bones is fine with us, it means we have tons of creative freedom #NandJByDesign
We can‚Äôt wait to help Azadeh &amp; Mohsen! #NAndJByDesign
Our mission: making this house a home again. #NAndJByDesign
And, we‚Äôre on! #NAndJByDesign

The ring is back &amp; the house is done... so, we‚Äôre out! #NAndJByDesign
BEST NEWS: we were under budget by $15K! Take that extra dough and celebrate! #NAndJByDesign
Yep, we definitely got it right ‚Äì those amazed and slightly dazed looks prove it. #NAndJByDesign
You know what time it is... reveal time! #NAndJByDesign
Maybe @JeremiahBrent and I should stick to picking out furniture, not assembling it. #NAndJByDesign
How does a giant piece of a sectional sofa go missing?! #NAndJByDesign
Coming up... my nightmare becomes a reality. #NAndJByDesign
We‚Äôve said it 95 times but it‚Äôs worth saying again: IT‚ÄôS TOTALLY FINE TO MIX METALS. #NAndJByDesign
I don‚Äôt know Tom‚Äôs grandmother, but she must be very chic if she likes mirrored furniture. #GLAMMA #NAndJByDesign
This girl has got ‚Äúno‚Äù down... #NandJByDesign
This scene is making @JeremiahBrent and me very nostalgic #NAndJByDesign
Bucket List item #36 ‚úîÔ∏è #NAndJByDesign
My only thought: I hope my pants don‚Äôt rip. #NAndJByDesign
This paint color is bringing Alex &amp; Tom‚Äôs house back to life! #NAndJByDesign
Who doesn‚Äôt love a good Happy Hour? (We‚Äôll find margaritas in the budget for sure) #NAndJByDesign
My gut is telling me to reinvent the existing fireplace. What would you do? #NAndJByDesign
@JeremiahBrent, I like where your head is at! Fun, colorful, outgoing ‚Äì just like Alex &amp; Tom. #NAndJByDesign
Did I just hear Alex say they have $100K to spend!? YES! #NAndJByDesign
Oy, they‚Äôre already arguing about WHAT they argue about... #NAndJByDesign
Those faces are priceless! My adrenaline is rushing! #NAndJByDesign
Ooh, the resentment is real, and I can‚Äôt blame them. #NAndJByDesign
Uncle Vinnie left quite a mess for Alex &amp; Tom, yikes! #NAndJByDesign
#NAndJByDesign is on NOW!
30 minutes until the new episode of #NAndJByDesign airs! Who will be watching with us?!
Tag that special someone who fights you over the remote...even though you‚Äôre both watching the same thing. #NAndJByDesign @JeremiahBrent https://t.co/72ylycxAxs
Treat your mother to a beautiful Mother's Day Brunch! Look how easy it is to set up a stunning table for the entire family to enjoy. https://t.co/FBddn7d7Bh
One of my favorite transformations this season on #NAndJByDesign! I think it's safe to say we accomplished East Coast meets West Coast. https://t.co/ULTOo5ujpL
Super proud to be included in this esteemed and talented group of designers on the #EDAlist, thank you @ELLEDECOR @MichaelBoodro https://t.co/YX6bgrnHmf

Hey Greg, your kitchen is real. #NAndJByDesign
Open your eyes Rochelle! We‚Äôre dying to know what you think of your new kitchen! #NAndJByDesign
Do you think we will pull off the ‚ÄúEast Coast meets West Coast‚Äù design? #NAndJByDesign
Oh goodness is right! Check out your new home Rochelle &amp; Greg! #NandJByDesign
Install day = BEST day #NAndJByDesign
Will Rochelle &amp; Greg love the reveal of their new home? We‚Äôll find out after the break! #NAndJByDesign
The cat is out of the bag. You‚Äôre getting brand new appliances thanks to @LGUSA! #LGSTUDIO #NAndJByDesign
In sync with that backsplash, go team #NandJByDesign
We‚Äôve been so invested in this project, feels like I sort of live here too #ForgotToKnock #NAndJByDesign
You don‚Äôt have to use Carrera marble to create an upscale space. Engineered surfaces can do the job too. #NAndJByDesign
Loving the yard sale enthusiasm @JeremiahBrent! #NAndJByDesign
Guess who I got to come with me to the yard sale üòè¬†#NAndJByDesign
Apparently I‚Äôm a messy eater? Thanks @JeremiahBrent ... I had no idea. #NAndJByDesign
Design Tip: With young families, outdoor fabric gives extra durability to indoor upholstery. #NAndJByDesign
As you can see, our daughter has some of the best manners in town. #NAndJByDesign
Will Rochelle come through with hosting the yard sale? We shall see after the break... #NAndJByDesign
Catch that look, @JeremiahBrent? #NAndJByDesign
As relatively new transplants to LA ourselves, we know exactly what Rochelle &amp; Greg have in mind for this NYC inspired design #NAndJByDesign
We‚Äôll use every last nickel. #NAndJByDesign
Couples who survive a renovation, can survive almost anything. #NAndJByDesign
This is so much more than just a kitchen remodel. #NAndJByDesign
Agreed, @JeremiahBrent, two smaller floating islands will open up the kitchen very nicely. #NAndJByDesign
Rochelle‚Äôs Requests: no black, no wallpaper, no rustic, and no off white. Basically, everything we love. #NAndJByDesign
We have $30K to spend on this renovation, let the budgeting begin! #NAndJByDesign
Potential career change for @JeremiahBrent and me: mimes. Good idea, right? #NAndJByDesign
Will Rochelle &amp; Greg be open to clearing out their home? Find out after the break. #NAndJByDesign
Now we know, if we need anything for Poppy we can shop at Rochelle &amp; Greg‚Äôs! #NAndJByDesign
OId Hollywood and Harlem Renaissance? No problem...#NAndJByDesign
SHH! They have no idea what‚Äôs ‚Äì or who‚Äôs - coming. #NAndJByDesign

Mission complete! Meg &amp; Chris‚Äôs home is officially ‚ÄúModern Southern Charmed‚Äù. #NAndJByDesign
In a tight budget bind? Shiplapping a room is cost effective and gorgeous! #NAndJByDesign
I think I‚Äôll use Meg‚Äôs phrase from now on, ‚ÄúSensory Overload‚Äù. #NAndJByDesign
CHRIS LIKES THE CHAISE! üëç #NandJByDesign
Seeing Meg's &amp; Chris's faces light up when they walk into their new home is truly an amazing moment for me and @JeremiahBrent #NAndJByDesign
Did we give Chris his bakery sign back? Find out after the break! #NAndJByDesign
It‚Äôs reveal day! How do you think we were able to make Meg &amp; Chris‚Äôs space work? #NAndJByDesign
We aren‚Äôt thrilled about the way the room is turning out. Now what.... #NAndJByDesign
It‚Äôs 1 day before the reveal and stakes are high. Can‚Äôt wait to see it all unfold. #NAndJByDesign
We have a decision... the chaise chair is coming home! #NAndJByDesign
Choosing a piece with a strong pattern can be tricky. Avoid having the patterned piece as the focal point of a space. #NAndJByDesign
We feel terrible that Chris &amp; Meg are living out of the garage during the renovation. Soon they‚Äôll have their new home! #NAndJByDesign
Coming up next... decision time. #NAndJByDesign
White washed bricks takes me right into the South, with that beautiful patina and charm. #NAndJByDesign
YES! We got furniture! #NAndJByDesign
‚ÄùDon‚Äôt pick up a sledgehammer unless you have a plan‚Äù is basically a metaphor for life. #NandJByDesign
Done &amp; done, it has been decided. Modern Southern Charm, here we go! #NAndJByDesign
Uh oh, the word rustic is banned from our vocabulary now. #NAndJByDesign
Meg, we know you‚Äôre nervous. But you have to trust us! We‚Äôre design ninjas! #NAndJByDesign
If you don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money on renovating, try reusing and restyling what you already have. #NandJByDesign
Phew. @JeremiahBrent and I agree on this one. #NAndJByDesign
Smart choice! Let‚Äôs redo the interior! #NAndJByDesign
Chris wants to paint the exterior, Meg wants to re-do the interior of the house. What will they decide? Stay tuned... #NAndJByDesign
Chris, back away from the sledgehammer. #NAndJByDesign
Agreed, @JeremiahBrent, a good decorator is a good listener. #NAndJByDesign
What‚Äôs Modern Nostalgic? Having some history but the style is mainly derived from the present. #NAndJByDesign
I think @JeremiahBrent might divorce me if I sit in this recliner for much longer... #NAndJByDesign
Sorry Chris... the Bakery sign has GOT TO GO. #NAndJByDesign
Meg &amp; Chris‚Äôs home is the ultimate time capsule from the 80‚Äôs. Any ideas on how we are going to revamp their home? #NAndJByDesign
We are design ninjas! @JeremiahBrent #NAndJByDesign
IT‚ÄôS GO TIME! Can‚Äôt wait to see Meg &amp; Chris‚Äôs faces when they see who has arrived. #NandJByDesign
Designer tip 101: Not all home projects are DIY, sometimes you have to bite the bullet and hire a professional. #NAndJByDesign
50 shades of brown &lt; 50 shades of any other color. #NandJByDesign
Let‚Äôs prevent a money pit Meg &amp; Chris! #NAndJByDesign
This house was built right around when I had my Bar Mitzvah... #NAndJByDesign
Now THAT‚Äôs a description: the ‚Äúmullet of design‚Äù #NAndJByDesign

Tensions are high! Stay tuned! #NAndJByDesign
What design elements say American Classic to you? #NAndJByDesign

I don‚Äôt blame Alan for being nervous, but we‚Äôre trustworthy! #NAndJByDesign
Yeah... I think I‚Äôm right #NAndJByDesign
Love when clients empower us like this! Yes! #NAndJByDesign
Uh oh, now we have to talk about money. #NAndJByDesign
What we need to create here is a master bedroom retreat like we‚Äôve never done before. #NAndJByDesign
Gathering at the family table means a lot in our home too. #NAndJByDesign
Vintage faucets - Janelle, you‚Äôre speaking my language! #NAndJByDesign
Yup Janelle, this is real life, we‚Äôre here for you. #NAndJByDesign

When designers disagree, we‚Äôll see... #NAndJByDesign
Poppy‚Äôs answered it, they‚Äôve got to have 2 bathrooms! #NAndJByDesign
Jason &amp; Kelly, your beachy inspiration is our Global Coast #NAndJByDesign

A6: Take time to personalize your space. Pay attention to the details #ModernMonday
A6: Changing out appliances can be easy...but you'll have them for a long time, so invest wisely #ModernMonday
A6: Painting cabinets can be a weekend process. Shop for antiques - vintage light fixtures or kitchen stools #ModernMonday
A6: Know you can tackle a kitchen renovation piecemeal. Own the process and believe you can do it! #MondernMonday
A5: The simplest upgrade for a family kitchen? Get organized. Corral mess in baskets, clear up the clutter #ModernMonday
A5: Features like a door-in-door fridge where snacks are easily accessible for the kids; a water dispenser that fits a pitcher #ModernMonday
A5: Your kitchen is the hardest working space in your home. It‚Äôs all about the details that help a family live better! #ModernMonday
A4: That their kitchens aren't hardworking enough, or pretty enough. Your kitchen should be in step with your lifestyle #ModernMonday
A3: Love the modern kitchen that I designed with @LGUS for @DwellonDesign this year #ModernMonday #LGStudio #vintage http://t.co/hTAkpacvrC
A3: A mix of what feels both contemporary and classic‚Ä¶a truly signature kitchen is functional &amp; also feels very personal #ModernMonday
Yes, @iconicornot - an island will always be a practical addition to the kitchen. It provides so many extras! #modernmonday
A2: Vintage flooring is also worth the splurge‚Ä¶save on new cabinetry by painting the existing ones #ModernMonday  https://t.co/cbZRPhG8uJ
I'm Artistic Advisor at @LGUS Studio. I can tell you hardworking appliances are worth every cent! #ModernMonday https://t.co/cbZRPhG8uJ
A2: Splurge on appliances. Premium stainless steel always looks good. Buy the best you can afford! #ModernMonday https://t.co/cbZRPhG8uJ
A2: Splurge on a well-made marble counter top. It‚Äôs durable &amp; will up the luxe factor of any kitchen #ModernMonday  https://t.co/cbZRPhG8uJ
A1: Things like subway tile, Carrara marble, butcher block, painted-wood cabinets. Think timeless #ModernMonday https://t.co/VL1T4MtFfa
A1: My best advice is to go with what is classic &amp; what has stood the test of time. #ModernMonday https://t.co/VL1T4MtFfa
A1: It means seeing through fleeting trends, and reaching for what you will love now‚Ä¶and 10 years from now.  https://t.co/VL1T4MtFfa
