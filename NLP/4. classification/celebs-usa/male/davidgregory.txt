“Lawless” state of our southern border...this is a moral issue, Trump says....
First 30 mins - give the president his due, this is a normal speech hitting bipartisanship, highlighting good guests, and Trump sounding like someone with broader appeal. And now comes the border “crisis”........
So is that a threat - if you keep investigating me I won’t sign legislation? What happened to no politics of revenge?
Mike Pence couldn’t be prouder.
A plea for unity, rejection of revenge politics and celebration of a strong economy. I would quite right now.
President Trump advocates rejecting politics of revenge. That’s rich.

@BillSimmons thank you for the rewatchables episode on proof of life. I was early in on that movie. The Godfather edition was also essential. It’s time to watch it w my kids.
Fascinating NYT interview w Trump. As related by the Daily podcast, the president desperately wants the paper to celebrate him (at least one) and cast him as legitimate. He may not like coverage but false charges of fake news undercut him.
He was classy, and a real pro. I woke up to him every day growing up. RIP https://t.co/CjajSGqyuO

Trump says about last night: “I thought it was very close to complete victory....”
Wow https://t.co/xA07zBPVJt
Unsurprisingly, the morning after the midterms the President has claimed victory, denigrated fellow republicans who rebuffed his help, and threatened to cut off Democrats if they investigate him.
President Trump: “Mia Love showed me no love, and lost” Classy.
Trump says GOP voters “rebuked” Senate Dems for handling of Kavanaugh. Hard to dispute this. The hearing created GOP energy across the party, not just hardcore Trump supporters.
So far, the president has described himself as the difference maker where GOP made gains. As for GOP losses, retirements seem to be the culprit.
And the message will be..... I’m listening to the voters? I had a big night? I want to work more closely w Dems? Let’s solve immigration once and for all? I’m really an amazing campaigner “if you wanna know the truth...” https://t.co/Z5h4yamgkP

Hard not to see Trump’s gun safety meeting in the context of WH in disarray. Seemed like he wanted the praise that comes w a show of bipartisanship. We saw this come and go on DACA. Will he really challenge the NRA in an election year?

Happy to debate merit congressman - let's start with credibility and undermining our institutions. Enough merit for you? https://t.co/7MQdBEPRtm
This is unfortunate. Good for @jonkarl for pressing the point. https://t.co/LH86IhEWH1
President wants credibility at the FBI. That's important. Comey damaged himself. Who will restore credibility at the White House ?
Trump press advisers can go after WH reporters and their "process stories" but they can't hide from their false statements and evasions
Sucks when people do that doesn't it? https://t.co/AZAotsbOSe
Listening to Roger Stone now on @NewDay makes clear Trump felt Comey was ignoring WH priority: leaks about Russia.
Roger Stone: "There is no Karl Rove in this administration."
When White House officials lose credibility our democracy is undermined. Thankfully the news media is doing its job. https://t.co/5PuWGzxUTm
Didn't anyone say to him, it's just not going to look right for you to do this now in the middle of this Russia investigation..../3
But the timing ..... why didnt he do it after the election or right before he took office? /2
I keep trying to see this from the President's point of view. He had a basis to fire Comey. There was bipartisan agreement on this. /1
President's supporters assert that Comey lost faith of rank and file at FBI. I don't think that's accurate and certainly not a uniform view
Very important. https://t.co/CQUrnKOHVN

Hey Doug can I back to the press briefing tomorrow? Just this once ? https://t.co/m9YYeUiHQX
Hmmmm did he mention this to President when he suggested firing him??!! https://t.co/apPPl8skOI
I agree w this. Or Trump should have fired him right after the election. https://t.co/C0q25gph9V
Look at this headline ... does anyone believe the "citing Clinton email part" anyone ? https://t.co/28Fub1XuKr
Yep that was me. I covered the first low speed chase. https://t.co/DH7oSWYmq2
Wonder if he ever questioned why he was asked to investigate Comey's actions when DOJ inspector gen was already doing that very probe. Used? https://t.co/hmjSyNt2cX
If liking your tweet is wrong I don't want to be right. https://t.co/u9JQ2lYINv
Joining @AC360 right now to talk Comey.
You could think Comey should be fired and still think this is wrong. Trump could have done this earlier and you can't fire the guy probing
His reputation for political independence is on the line. Will he stand up to the WH like say Jim Comey did in 2004? https://t.co/BOpB86bo8l
It's clear the president was not happy w Yates getting more news attention yesterday. He went big today.
Disagree - you can't fire the guy when he's investigating you that's never going to be appropriate. https://t.co/muyNLZoP1j
Quite true - Trump is obsessed w Russia investigation. He fired the guy leading it. As my daughter might say, purge much? https://t.co/moJsumLUo3
Trump timeline: "lock her up" "I'm going to put you in jail" "Comey mistreated Hillary I will fire him". Hmmmm
At moments like this it's important that everyone listen to @JeffreyToobin @CNN
Rough letter https://t.co/VYvSBMOJdo
At the same time, it's true, Comey has undermined his leadership by his handing of Clinton.
How can you possibly do that without the appearance of abuse of power ?
Can I just ask the obvious: how is it okay to fire the man leading an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded w Russia? 1/2
So many questions about why Trump would fire Comey. Is he doing it BC of the Russia inquiry? He can't be doing it in support of HRC
Very good point. https://t.co/CZcLtALiCj

What troubles me is that some strong natl sec minds on his team aren't talking today. But Haley was very strong. Maybe she's the f-p voice https://t.co/aoaCh6oDLt
I do! Seriously though why do you think Haley is bashing Russia and Trump hasn't yet. Do you think that's by design? https://t.co/uyzSodzujH
Congress has shirked its responsibility to take up the AUMF for years. https://t.co/bZjOBYIY3M
Haley was also far more forceful and thorough in her remarks than the President. Is that the WH intent?
Amb Haley at the UN also just said the US is prepared to do more militarily in Syria. Showdown set w Russia. What now?
Amb Haley is doing a serious takedown of Russia and its role propping up Assad and facilitating its chem weapons program.
Given all the sh*t happening about Russia at the time how do you overlook that detail? https://t.co/29qKsQMQ25

Worth noting Trump's nat sec team is critical of Russia. @SenJohnMcCain said tdy he's voting for Tillerson and has confidence in Trump team
I agree media should be held accountable by govt and public, but what did Prez  mean when he said media "will pay a tremendous price?"
Trump aides say "watch what he does," but they have no defense 4 why he and his press sec failed 2 tell truth about small issue of crowd.
It's time 4 President Trump to lead and solve problems. His war on media and obsession with issues like crowd size don't make America great.

So far I think Trump is losing. His areas of strength: econ, trade, change message and critique of foreign policy. Can he build on those?
Trump had a good retort about Prez Clinton meeting with AG - that was incredibly bad judgment
Clinton may seem programmed but this is why prep matters: she's again here on "rigged" election severely hurting Trump
Trump says "I will keep you in suspense" about whether he will accept election results. This is dangerous.
On his accusers, Russia, the media, rigged election charges, Trump is again hurting himself badly. This is more of the same
Trump is now unraveling ...again.
Stories of women accusing Trump have been "debunked." By whom?
Trump thought bubble, "That Wallace is one tough hombre" He clearly likes his questions for Clinton.
Trump just referred to Obama's "regime" -- that's tyrant talk hombre.
Trump seems to admire Putin for "outsmarting" Clinton and lacking respect for our Secy of State and President.
HRC puppet line is a serious blow to Trump who is seen as unqualified for the job by a majority of Americans.
This is an incredible moment - A GOP nominee refuses to distance himself from Putin + condemn a Russian leader trying to influence a US elex
Trump says Russia has no respect for "her" or President Obama. Doesn't condemn Putin.
Let them talk and engage each other!
Big league
HRC says DT "choked" when visiting Mexico. Take that hombre.
Debating the wall seems so retro.
"We have some bad hombres here and we are going to get them out." I'm getting that t-shirt made now.
Oy, I know.  https://t.co/TQqkskagI9
Interesting on first two issues there is a strong ideological divide. Conservatives likely happy with how he handled those issues.
Trump has said womb twice now. Its 9:19
It appears that Wallace is much better prepared than Trump to challenge Clinton on these policy areas. I'd like to see these two mix it up
Would be great if they actually debated each other
DT for abortion litmus test; HRC not saying whether she would stick by Judge Garland.
Trump simply wants a mic that will stand up
Wait, issues? Topics?
Last chance 4 Trump to make a wider appeal to voters as race has tilted in Clinton's favor. No handshakes tonight. Prediction, Mr T? "Pain"
Can HRC land a knockout blow tonight ? What to expect - my preview on the live debate blog https://t.co/M04GSf8WiO

If you are up early tune in! We are talking politics on @NewDay with post debate analysis
interesting 2 hear Trump +pol commentators say others would be in jail if they'd done what HRC did. - didn't FBI dir say NO, not even close?
Will debate change minds? Trump has been slipping and now there is tape incident and GOP revolt. A draw is fine for HRC if its that
Pence is helpful to Trump with the GOP base. He vouches for him in among cons GOP and tonight Trump threw him under the bus.
Trump doubling down on "locker room talk" is going to hurt him...and team HRC will be using that.
If voters judge this to be a strong night for Trump, he still has to deal with the damage he's done to himself over the tape.
Graceful note at the end by DT
Just to underline this, Trump said HRC would be in jail if he were president.
For some he may be exposing her weaknesses, but is he shoring up his own?
I agree w those who say DT core supporters will love his performance tonight, but is he adding support beyond base?
Trump has to be at 10k steps tonight. See, he does work out.
Does DT think Assad hasn't killed civilians? What is he reading?
Trump disagrees with Pence on Syria and Russia. They haven't spoken about it.
Yep, and still is a good attack on her judgement.  https://t.co/dw6m15a6l1
DT's attack on HRC judgment channeling Sanders could be effective. He's much better prepared tonight.
Trump concedes he uses tax laws to avoid paying personal federal income tax
DT very strong on taxes and making the 30 year argument v HRC is DT at his best
"I know nothing about Russia." "I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia." - DT
Good follow up by AC - BC getting tagged on hc comments and for meeting with AG on tarmac
DT speaking to Clinton haters tonight, but who is he adding? Remember majorities think he's neither fit not qualified to be Prez. Helping?
No kids, it doesn't have to be like this ... and it isn't always like this. This is an unfortunate year
DT going after everyone.
"Big diversion...."
Shame and jail ... this sounds a lot like the RNC
Whatever you think of the content, DT has done all he can do - turn this on her and put her on defensive.
Its a good thing that Rudy and Christie got Trump ready to look more presidential.
DT  has concluded this is the only shot he has left.
Shouldn't he have tried to defend himself on fitness for office charge rather than promise to make life better in the inner cities?
DT should be appealing to GOP right now not minorities...they aren't going to vote for him
Clear she's going in for kill early - fitness for office is the message tonight from HRC
WOW this is happening
Trump slogan: grabbing xxx and killing ISIS
"Locker room talk" ... sniffling .. "medieval times" all in one sentence.
Weak from both candidates...what kind of campaign are they waging in front of our children?
HRC passing up her first shot to go after DT on the tape comments
HRC didn't answer the q
No handshake and a frostier vibe between them for sure.

Lester was unflappable throughout. Had the fact checking balance right I thought. Night was not about him https://t.co/uxFFGOYCGs
Last night's debate better bc no crowd. Trump fed off crowd in primary  debates. Last night he seemed too hot and riled up for the room.
Key difference last night: Trump took the bait she dangled out there; she did not. Emails = good example. She let some of his attacks go.
WP calls HRC "flawed, but knowledgeable, confident and even tempered."  https://t.co/T6GjAtHx3K
DT needs college + whites; she needs more enthusiasm from Obama coalition. Does debate move the needle?  https://t.co/4ASyIpQPtm
I'll join the conversation on @NewDay starting at 5am et. See you then!
Here's another bottom line in my view: Trump certainly represents change, but she appears more presidential.
I disagree. I think she was happy to have him go on the way he did. https://t.co/jzpmhVFaVn
@davidaxelrod makes good point, HRC could have personalized stories about people she's met.
She was composed, prepared, unflappable. Her night, but we'll see if it changes the race. I agree he took bait 2much https://t.co/0hdUesU94s
I think the big HRC follow up tomorrow is that Trump appeared to concede he doesn't pay income tax.
I think back half of debate hurts Trump...birther issue, Rosie O'Donnell, his taxes, women, focus on Sidney Blumenthal.
After debate Trump says he's proud he forced Obama to release his birth certificate. He's doubling down on one of his big weaknesses.
My scorecard: DT good on trade, establishment pols, econ writ large, bad on his taxes, women, Iraq, national security, birther issue.
HRC was able to bait DT on women and he was at his worst in response..
Voters will tell us soon whether this debate changed any minds. I don't know.
In the end Trump articulated the outsider message well, she showed she was better prepared and exposed his weaknesses.
Last few minutes were some of Trump's shakiest.
DT undermines strengths tonight with lines like she doesn't have stamina.  Strong response from HRC
HRC line about being baited by tweet is still solid...
Perhaps strongest moment for HRC right here about DT and national security
I think Lester Holt is doing a very good job.
Uh...I think the Iraq war had a lot to do with Iran becoming a major power.
Trump really weak tonight on releasing his taxes and birther nonsense.
Those of you with entrenched views on twitter tonight, you are not a persuadable voter...look at these two with that in mind.
Trump may lose on points and in fact checking and that's important. But HRC has yet to disqualify him in this debate.
One hour in... DT exceeding expectations. He's prepared, disciplined and serious. She is well prepared commanding as expected.
DT strong on police issues... Stills looks bad on birther issues....
A GOP friend watching ..no fan of Trump...says DT articulating well what people dislike about DC and pols...he adds she's more rational.
Clinton running through her attack playbook methodically...Trump is counterpunching.
HRC argument ... Trump sticks it to the little guy like her father...several references to him ...
Trump is losing on this tax release issue. Sounds defensive
Trump, "We've become a third world country."
HRC "Something he's hiding" But she deleted 30k emails.
HRC strong on taxes ???? This is what happens when you don't release taxes....raises questions.
Trump is too wound up ... Clinton under control. But's put her on the defensive ....
Would be better to duel him rather than point to the website....
Strong exchange on trade ... Trump has her on defensive ... but she's not rattled....
Early attack on Trump about being out of touch rich guy...typical attack against GOP re taxes and debt.
The DT sniffle is gonna become a thing...no?
DT didn't take the bait...showing signs of a different Donald tonight.
14 m borrowed from his father?   HRC going to a sore spot for DT ... his wealth...
First blow over taxes ... trumped up trickle down...not about DT temperment
Two quick nods to DT by HRC .. a hearty hello .. and now .. a "good to be with you" ... she's determined to be a steel magnolia tonight.
Clinton lays it out there...the threshold q tonight: who can handle the job of president. Trump's big weakness.
Don't know about you but I'm exhausted by all the things I have to expect and look for tonight

Re Trump and Russia I'd be curious to read analysis of how Putin exploited closer ties to Bush post 9-11 cc @peterbakernyt David Remnick
Also striking about Trump re Russia was Pence's attempt to treat matter more seriously afterward via statement. Would that be Pence's role?

Let's also remember that Trump trashed Cruz's father and wife during the primary.
Cruz must be counting on Trump losing but what about wrath of Trump supporters ? Trump family sat on hands
Cruz giving a speech for 2020 campaign. Sees himself as leader of conservatives.
Trump walks into hall after his main rival refuses to endorse him. Stunning. Crowd boos. Incredible moment. Huge blow to party unity
Cruz defies chants of "we want Trump" - won't endorse. Boos greet the end of his speech!!!
Cruz losing crowd for failing to endorse trump
I was thinking the same thing.  https://t.co/NbLUiyGXKQ

Seems obvious, but Trump speaking about #Brexit like a business guy, not a potential world leader. Q is that refreshing or dangerous?
Could be, but still you want to address off the top of your remarks. Even to be cautious.  https://t.co/1i1y7QYubT
What does today say about his capacity as a world leader? How will swing voters react to his analysis ? https://t.co/MLgvCgOYBO
Trump predicts Brexit will be a good thing, maybe not in the short term, but overall.
Top of presser I mean
Trump speaking about Brexit now when asked. Perhaps he wanted to avoid weighing in, but still seems obvious to address it off top of pressed
what is Trump doing? He had a chance to immediately seize on the Bexit vote to link it to his campaign and he's talking about new greens
Forget Brexit, isn't it amazing that there are suites in the Trump lighthouse in Scotland?
It's a very sound of music look as Trump approaches the mic in Scotland
Anxiety over national id, immigration, economic stress and distrust of large institutions - all parallels between #Brexit and US politics

Is Democratic unity possible? A preview of my interview this week with @davidaxelrod https://t.co/vlL3jKqdwg https://t.co/IYKeaRFajP
If the judge's bias is so obvious then why didn't Trump's lawyers seek to remove him? Oh right they don't think that https://t.co/y0OLoSv8IW
What do you like about him? https://t.co/LrEHXwtmjZ
What's true is that none of us predicted his success thus far. Either way, I don't see a landslide.  https://t.co/kNvIehdDB6

@NewDay right now. Let's talk politics !
Don't worry. I'm not driving. It's a parking lot. I could tweet the federalist papers in this traffic.  https://t.co/vFYkQwQht8
DC gridlock takes on new meaning. I never want to drive again.
Hard to be unfair when your report the man's own words.  https://t.co/eJj9Gi6gpc
Sorry but Trump made this an issue by attacking the judge and spending ten minutes on the case during a speech  https://t.co/XJG3mLxjiD
Trump statement says judge has been unfair but he kicked the case till after election and Trump's lawyer says judge is "doing his job"
Wow name calling and a baseless charge while ignoring issue at hand. Is this homeroom?  https://t.co/YgxEoWbqWz
Why is race or ethnicity a conflict? And if they believe that then why haven't lawyers tried to get him recused? https://t.co/pQPQHzRiRo
This is powerful.  https://t.co/JyOqhepCDr
Trump spox on @CNN re judge comments: no answer to ? Why haven't Trump lawyers tried to rescue him? Why? BC they admit, "He's doing his job"
Yes thank you. Question is would he ignore ....? https://t.co/NE2cKLKEZ6
It's good to stop and remember: "To be spiritual is to be amazed." https://t.co/VlYr0xiuDK
Is Trump ignoring his highly respected lawyer? Would be ignore WH counsel as president ?  https://t.co/wWSRkKWy1z
Despite what Trump SAYS his lawyer has NOT filed motion to recuse judge. Why not use law to back up his attack? 1/2 https://t.co/wWSRkKWy1z
@NewDay !! https://t.co/SOkkgAlucV

@SamHarrisOrg is my guest on the DG show. He warns of the danger of radical Islam + the failure of liberals. https://t.co/OLFY8Hg9KR
Liked the NYT piece on Rhodes except for the baseless smear against @JeffreyGoldberg - amazing how some reporters can misrepresent isn't it?

Well a president w 50 percent approval can turn  out the vote.  https://t.co/CRs0H0lVFM
Kara is straight talking for sure. Tells it like it is. That's all the rage now  https://t.co/eUrvyrefEI
Yes it's avail wherever you get podcasts. Thanks for allowing me to clarify https://t.co/7Tgwvn0fXd
What advice would be seek about the presidency and from whom? Would he ask President Obama for advice?  https://t.co/dgk6vvJfHT
What role will @POTUS play for Clinton this Fall especially since he has a near 50 % approval rating ?
@RonBrownstein breaks down the data behind Trump's rise. https://t.co/OKqVzUryvT
Hillary says Trump rivals didn't have experience and weren't willing to take him on substantively. #CNN
Hillary says America can't take a risk on a "loose cannon" like Trump for President. Repeated cannon line twice or three times #CNN
They might need a religion correspondent  https://t.co/VQiL5iTCx7

ICYMI - talking Trump, the nominee on @NewDay https://t.co/OsKmOE75d0
Joining @NewDay now after Trump win: can he unite the GOP? If so, how?
Something Sanders and supporters can use to keep competing.  https://t.co/YH9MFR5lAq
? now is how Trump tries to appeal to the never, ever Trump voices. Is there any way for them to come over to him? @EWErickson @RichLowry
Cruz support was always too narrow, as you have said for months.  https://t.co/zIsmFIZOfz
Can Trump say something to Republicans like Senator Graham tonight? https://t.co/yGQ0lLAQnf
Your point is an important one. Exit poll show so many GOP voters feel betrayed by their leadership  https://t.co/YyedECmFKI
Could be. High negatives. Has not united party. But he's unpredictable. So is his impact.  https://t.co/TkScryr1UO
I have different view. Governors, future stars of party. It was pretty strong.  https://t.co/CexCN8kNBH
Cruz made ideological case v Trump in Indiana: social issues, argued he was a liberal like Clinton, even picked a VP + no Kasich! And lost.
@DavidChalian makes strong point based on exits Trump Econ message (anti trade, and companies sending jobs to Mexico) is working for him.
Trump has taken over the GOP, blown away good competition and has shown his support cuts across the GOP coalition.
Trump wins Indiana. Cruz called the state his firewall. Don't see where the stop Trump movement goes from here.
Yeah but that was a long time ago.  https://t.co/scMovb9fn7

you are in a rush to be offensive, but I didn't say he couldn't win, just long odds. I may absolutely be wrong.  https://t.co/2LoEJRVamR
Sometimes observation is enough https://t.co/xQqOsZzNTl
I agree I think Trump faces long odds based on history  and demographics.  https://t.co/V6J3AyFIGv
Smart. A lot of Trump folks may not agree w/everything but feel he'll shake up DC which they think can't hurt. https://t.co/XiNp5R4jnG
Yes I was trying to be funny w the cylinder line  https://t.co/tqHVvyvEsV
To be fair he was probably being very specific to the ring itself, but should have known to call it a cylinder. https://t.co/pcKUm5aOFH

Yes I do. Nothing for Cruz tonight, nothing for Kasich. And they are going to stop Trump? https://t.co/1brHzMonHX

Great to be back and thank you! https://t.co/XsNqDXfAoQ
@JackNRSA Thanks Jack ... Glad you are tuning in
It's an early start to @NewDay. I'm on set joining the conversation about the big results for Clinton, Trump and Kasich from Super Tuesday
Trump on Rubio - tough smart and has a great future. "Little Marco"
Kasich win impressive. His speech is uplifting. But conservatives I'm talking to don't think he can be nominee and they fret he hurts Cruz
The game done changed.  https://t.co/N58dQLQhtv
Kasich wins among those concerned most about the economy. Striking given Trump's strength in this issue.
Fair point.  https://t.co/r4CkDAPaA8
Significant to me that majority of GOP favor a pathway to citizenship illegal immigrants.  https://t.co/jL0xCnabfY
A fabulous lane.  https://t.co/pbhfxZAnAP
Rubio says this is not the year for a hopeful and optimistic vision for America. Great.
Rubio speaks of riding a tea party wave into office and now was just crushed by it or whatever the Trump wave is.
How do we define the Trump lane? https://t.co/sO3tFr6Iq5
What is a winning coalition for Trump in the Fall?  https://t.co/zumiWAzf6E
I remember when Rubio was the one Clinton people feared. Strange year.
A big day in politics. The end of the fight or just the beginning of a new phase? Send your thoughts

Which is why there is a President's Club made of of men who understand and appreciate that reality
Still reading @JeffreyGoldberg piece about Obama FP. One note: presidential decision-making infinitely more complex than campaign rhetoric.
It's early in the @NewDay and I'll join the conversation with post debate analysis at a special time 5aET
Rubio made strong case for himself tonight - less Interested in contrast w Trump.
Trump tired to take focus off him saying to GOP establishment there are millions behind me - join me. Smart politics.
Phew, back to the polls.
Two man race yet?
Wow, Trump advocates bucking GOP rules. Whoever has most delegates should win.
It's interesting to hear these candidates on stage talking about the social context for why people resort to violence at Trump events.
Crowd size matters.
I think debate tonight has more sober tone which is good for GOP brand. Cruz has drawn most contrast with Trump.
Trump might find the book Red Notice about Putin's Russia interesting
Putin has been a strong leader for Russia - Trump. That sounds like admiration for a tyrant.
Trump has not mentioned a poll once tonight. A huge difference from other debates
I have a hankering for a steak right now
This is really good work by @jaketapper and team tonight. #GOPDebate
And then US has no role post ISIS in region? Is that a real policy?
Trump - knock out ISIS fast and then come home. What happens in the region next? And how do you knock them out without ground troops?
Cruz has compared Trump to Hillary twice tonight.
Trump loves Israel like he loves New Hampshire and the poorly educated.
Parading for Israel.
Cruz has shown great skill in issuing a litany against Trump. Not just tonight.
Trump's anti Muslim views could explain some of his support among evangelicals, many of whom condemn basic tenets of Islam as violent v West
Strong answer from Rubio on Muslims who serve our military
"I mean a lot of them...." Trump on how many Muslims hate the US
Forty minutes in, Rubio and Cruz seem afraid to challenge Trump. He, Trump, is as quiet and measured as I've ever seen him. Tick tock.
Cruz making a strong case about impact of tariffs on average consumers. Contrast with Trump fuming about China "behaving."
Cruz advancing the Bush proposal on SS personal accounts for younger workers. But is taking gutsy move of calling for raising retirement age
Talking about waste, fraud and abuse re SS instead of raising taxes or cutting benefits is a cop out.
Btw, by this point in the last debate Trump had already spoken extensively about his man parts.
On foreign policy, I'd like to know specifically what these candidates think the leadership lesson of the Iraq war is.
Trump's interested in staying above fray. He's playing out the clock. But others have a need to take the fight to the front runner, no?
Disney and Carson endorsing Trump.
Really smart points from @RonBrownstein - Trump is on the brink of nomination but is only plurality frontrunner w big probs in general @CNN
@Mingcat @NewDay @RonBrownstein thank you Francine. Really, it's the company I'm keeping.
@AnnElaineNY @CNN thanks Ann!
We are ready for our @NewDay to discuss the dem debate and tonight's GOP showdown here in Miami. @RonBrownstein https://t.co/IoFVnydybv
Who is more prepared for television this morning ? @NewDay @ChrisCuomo https://t.co/JPMpzVZtEX
Confusing - if HRC were a more natural politician, she would be trusted more?
Sanders says that Trump has resorted to racism, bigotry and xenophobia....calls deportation plan, "vulgar."
Clinton calls Trump wall a "fantasy." We have done a good job securing the border so now let's do immigration reform says Clinton
Clinton - "We have the most secure border we have ever had...the Republicans no longer have an argument." #don'tgobuildingborderwalls
Clinton giving a lot more context on the auto bailout issue....to attack Sanders...after this backfired in Mi.
Tough exchange ... Sanders swings back hard about auto bailout bill....accuses her of misrepresenting the issue....
They have both said DAPA and DACA like people know what those are
Hispandering
Clinton says case can be made v Trump without calling him names - guess she noticed it didn't help Rubio. Attacks by HRC would help Trump
Clinton says Trumps "traffics in prejudice" but declines to call him a racist.
@IAMQUEENLATIFAH Queen L, can I get a follow? I have a request for you. Thanks.
Trump - "I am a uniter, but I have to finish off the project...." Predicts debate tomorrow will be "softer" @NewDay
Trump calls for unity but WSJ poll finds that 2/3 of voters say they couldn't see themselves supporting him. 43% of GOP view negatively
Trump - "I would love to see the party come together and unify." @NewDay
Trump touting his relationship to Fla where he has major real estate holdings - and winning so strong in South suggests good things in N. Fl
Trump tells @ChrisCuomo attacks against him were "horrible false." @NewDay
Big night in politics and a @NewDay - I'll join the conversation starting at 530et. @CNN
I thought auto bailout answer by HRC was a knockout to Sanders. May have backfired in fact.
What does that say to you Ron? https://t.co/Ab47MkPI89
Excellent Godfather reference. Well played. CC @jpodhoretz  https://t.co/ryMlvY8o0n
Trump reminds me of the DeNiro character in "Heat" -- has to settle every score, every slight against him.
That's just funny on numerous levels.  https://t.co/2Na46GAtzZ
I'm waiting patiently with an open mind !!!   https://t.co/GekU6IREUz
Every GOP candidate getting their moment .... Except Rubio.
Good for you! So well deserved.   https://t.co/WHoylPEve7

The point is learning where God is for our public figures. Even if the answer is no where we still learn something  https://t.co/q9NJMDYrX5
I really appreciate these questions about faith. The answers are revealing not divisive.
2/2 She made it clear that she feels teachers are scapegoated and she is endorsed by biggest unions.
Given answer on teachers should voters worry that Clinton would be less likely to pressure teachers on accountability and merit pay? 1/2
Aren't there severe limits to what a President can do to fix local schools?
Clinton says not enough money for education but Obama admin directed an historic amount to education and still we have all these probs.
Coming up at 11a et I'll join @brianstelter on @CNNReliable to discuss presidential debates and the GOP race.
Thanks Howard, I appreciate that  https://t.co/Gep2NkaoIw

Would it be a stronger signal to potential supporters to say he would not back Trump even if the nominee?  https://t.co/CFscJ74OIj
Good morning, how did you feel about last night's GOP debate? I'll join @NewDay on CNN to offer some of my take aways at 6a et.
Yep, good point. Didn't think of that. And he could help Trump in Congress.  https://t.co/08XYiGV1gi
Kasich shouldn't have dodged a very good q on Putin since underestimating Putin has been a huge problem for two presidents.
The breathing and yoga sequence was funny.
Me too, but I don't know how to do that  https://t.co/hGMYs0uSSq
It's clear that Trump believes in CNN
Have Cruz and Rubio exchanged a cross word? Don't think I've heard it.
Is Trump's flexibility refreshing, evidence of shooting from the hip, or a sign he has no core beliefs?
@NewDay with a big role during debate!
My son to me just now, "Daddy, I'll know when it's time to go to bed, BELLLLIEEEEVE ME." #trumpeffect
Very good question @BretBaier about torture and if military refuses
I have to say this audience is particularly unruly. It detracts from debate and they are mugging for camera. Why do we need an audience?
I think Cruz is having a very good night so far. He's making a crisp and specific case against Trump as insincere.
@tomguarriello it was auto correct, honest
True - I think Rubio is getting under his skin more.  https://t.co/Ky3Wtjzdxc
I agree with that. It's simply a matter of pressing him on whether he's flexible on deportation. Sounds like he is. https://t.co/BfNpd8A8Y8
Trump suggests he's flexible on deportation, what I meant to say is - the follow up is whether deportation of 11m up for negotiation or not?
Trump on off record meeting with Times, re immigration, "there always has to be some tug and pull and deal...."
Cruz is much more effective in his litany than Rubio sniping at Trump and talking over him.
This feels more like a Red Wings game.
Two consecutive presidents have promised to bring Washington together Gov. Kasich.
It's 9:15 pm + Trump has already said something none of us would want our children to hear. Might even his supporters question his decency?
Follow up for Trump on race - why does he think he has attracted so much support from white supremacists including David Duke?
New dynamic tonight, just four candidates. How will Trump handle the onslaught tonight? I'm sure he'll be pressed on specifics.
On a cold DC night like this I'm thankful for @MarthasTableorg and Mckenna's Wagon providing a meal for the neediest in our community.
This may explain why Romney doesn't want to endorse anyone.  https://t.co/DI9aClf3hq
Answer is in https://t.co/njUTd1nSoV
Trump, "Police are abused...." "One bad incident...."
This is gonna big a big debate tonight. If only Romney would join ...  https://t.co/NjABfiP072
Trump has said he gets audited every year because he's a Christian cc @ChrisCuomo
I'm learning a lot about constructing a building.
Third protestor disrupts Trump event....
I'm sorry, that was an error in judgement on my part! https://t.co/u8CpIBzhHH
Correction to earlier tweet, should have said Jobs said there weren't enough engineers.
Trump insulting Romney, but has yet to answer any of the substance raised by Romney. We'll see if he does.
Trump saying Romney should have won and "he let us down.." Speaks to the betrayal  GOP voters feel toward GOP establishment
Trump says Romney "demeaned 47 percent of country"
Trump says Romney would have dropped to his knees for his endorsement in 2012.
Trump wants to see iPhones made in US not in China. Jobs told Obama they're weren't enough highly trained engineered in US to do so.
One effect of Romney today: Trump getting his entire stump speech in Maine covered live....I haven't seen Rubio or Cruz today.
Another protestor disrupts ... Trump says he's trying to sound less harsh by saying "Please get them out"
@virgalleg @CNN Thank you very much
Trump, "This is not a plateau, we have a movement going on."
@atwaldrop You are very kind, thank you
Trump now talking about buying a farm in Iowa, land in Maine and a little something in NH as well.
Trump, "I told my people, I have to go to Maine."
Trump just now: "Get him out," after protestor disrupts top of his event. "What are they doing...?"
I think it would have been effective for Romney to have addressed this in his remarks today. https://t.co/lYPhj8yO8S
To be clear, the headgear is in support of the Kennedy Center hosting the opera! https://t.co/1pkMpKaFNM
I'll be on @CNNnewsroom at the top of the hour to discuss Romney v Trump. Oh wait, Romney is not running for anything.
I think there are many who would agree w you  https://t.co/NSm78JtRxv
Romney speaking out against Trump now but accepted his endorsement in 2012
I wonder what impact Romney has. It's a strong speech but does it make Rubio and Cruz look smaller? Does it only strengthen Trump?
I love my tie to Oklahoma. Honored by it.  https://t.co/qEyH8mMGNY
@MittRomney saying either Cruz or Rubio should be nominee.
"He inherited his business he did not build it." @MittRomney on Trump
This is the case against Trump I think @MittRomney wished Rubio would have made by now.
Exit polls showed majorities weren't comfortable with him as nominee.  https://t.co/1bl1BtUQyy

This is an important point to show why a big field helps Trump every day it stays this way  https://t.co/z6hcglH1PO
Excellent piece. See Reagan quote. Is Trump's refusal to disavow Duke about courting racist supporters today? https://t.co/WfvMq7n7jz
@jdkelley Thanks a lot Dave. Happy to be contributing.
So why did he fumble answer on CNN yesterday? https://t.co/UhHD9s4Ftr
Don't disagree it's been overkill, but also reveals who he really is. He hasn't shied away from interviews.  https://t.co/IeUd6ypZ2O
But Rubio team insists this campaign has a long way to go https://t.co/q8AYwpFt4e
I never thought in the age of ISIS, massacre in Syria, economic anxiety that PERSPIRATION would dominate the political debate.
Truth https://t.co/hNaqlFOLld
Yep what was Christie's line - "Just ask him (Trump) how..." How he accomplishes what he says he will.  https://t.co/lczh76YYvC
That would be correct  https://t.co/8ZB0hUDgbm
Yep could be if it comes to that. Clear the Christie is willing to get in early and abandon GOP ranks worried re T https://t.co/Pt6mE1wkh8
Christie is a more establishment pol who reinforces the Trump brand. Still, it's surprising.
Chris Christie endorses Trump. First big endorsement. Possible veep? First reaction is that he ll be good attack dog for Trump.
Thanks Joel https://t.co/yFZL5bETvw
Wrong - I'm including Trump in that critique.  https://t.co/moSjJQ5pYH
Presidential politics 2016: candidate reads insults on Twitter and responds with ridicule and insults. Great.
New lines from Rubio today on Trump: "we unmasked him last night." "Friends don't let friends vote for Trump."
Rubio channeling @KimStrassel on the stump talking about how Trump has been sticking it to "the little guy."
Coming up at the top of the hour on @CNN to discuss last night's debate and road to Tuesday. Will con artist attack work by Rubio?
Agreed  https://t.co/SkJbBUDhO5
I think the Rubio attack on Trump that he's a con artist could be effective. Rather than target ideology try idea that he's not real. Thots?
Who won the debate? Who did it benefit most? And was it a new low for political discourse in 2016? I'll join the conversation on @NewDay 7a
Trump to @ChrisCuomo suggests he gets audited because he's a "strong Christian."
trump: "we have to have someone one who doesn't sweat"
I wondered what label Trump would give Rubio - it's "choke artist"
Trump to @ChrisCuomo "I've dealt w a lot tougher." Found debate "exciting"
I'll be part of the team analyzing tonight's debate tomorrow at 7a et on @NewDay @CNN
Carson wants America to elect his hands.
To be fair the debate belongs to candidates they are talking over each other and calling each other names  https://t.co/2sq6hOnvFV
I'm glad my kids are not awake for this.
Yay, someone said "Ben Carson"
Trump answers attacks w "choke artist" and "liar" "ratings" "polls" and "deals"
Carson - "can someone attack me?" Great line. But the answer is no.
Correction: Nielsen.
Strong debate tonight - persistent, substantive q's and candidates finally willing to engage hard (ridiculous name calling aside)
Cruz-Rubio combo has gotten under Trump's skin but who benefits more ?
First commercial break after one hour plus in...good for @CNN
Attack on Trump: unelectable, thin on details, hypocrite, not conservative. Except, he's the front runner.
Polls versus substance
Trump on Hillary, "I haven't even started on her."
Does Trump ever miss an opportunity to offend someone personally? Is that what American voters want?
If Trump doesn't win, he should be President of Nielson.
Trump: "You don't learn anything from a tax return."
Trump appears mighty thin on policy detail
So far an effective hit by Rubio on Trump for lack of details on health care and shifting immigration views. Where has this Rubio been?
Homeroom
Lines are beautiful. Can someone tweet clarification on this?
Did Kasich just suggest that gays and lesbians should "change their behavior?"
Trump: "millions and millions of women are helped by planned parenthood...." But he would defund it.
Has Ben Carson come on the stage yet? He was called right?
Rubio: "We are the party of diversity, not the Democrats."
Good news for Rubio tonight .. It already feels like a one on one debate
Rubio just discovered Google tonight....dropping tons of oppo on Trump
Rubio - will Trump use Polish workers to build the wall?
Trump not eating Oreos because of Mexico
Trump dissecting use of f-word. #diplomacy
Kasich "Massive deportations aren't practical and don't reflect America"
Kasich called on ... My son says, "finally"
Where have Rubio and Cruz been while Trump was winning everywhere?
Rubio already on Trump - said he supported pathway to citizenship and faulted Romney for self deportation
Don't mess with Texas
I knew staring into the abyss was bad. Heading off it, wow.

@AnnMcbro @kbt278 @CNN So glad you are watching, thank you.
When Trump labels his rivals it hurts. Jeb, "low energy," Cruz, "liar" -- what label has he or will he give to Rubio?
@kbt278 @CNN thank you Karen!
Keys now for GOP race - tomorrow night's debate. How does Rubio seek to disqualify Trump? Does electability work when Rubio hasn't yet won?
Listening to Rubio supporters make argument that Rubio owns the 2nd place the position. Does it matter with Cruz + Kasich still in? @NewDay
TUNE IN: at 30 past the hour we look at the delegate count and the calendar. When could Trump and Clinton seal the deal? On @NewDay @CNN
Donald Trump in victory, "I love the poorly educated!" Trump wins across the board in Nevada.

Good morning Twitter friends. I'll be on @NewDay at the top of the hour to discuss Pope/Trump and the @CNN town hall.
Strong piece about how Trump's public discourse is not something we accept in our private lives. https://t.co/OrhkeUCzXp
Trump on Iraq -  "By the time the war started, I was against it." By the way, he wasn't a politician then.
Except for the time he said we should.  https://t.co/FHKNO54p8c
But Trump has backed away from calling Bush a liar. And now there's his Howard Stern interview when Trump said he would invade Iraq in 02
The GOP front runner just blamed George W Bush for just about everything that's wrong in the world. Our politics have changed a bit, no?
Trump: "We don't have time to be politically correct in this country."
"My numbers are fantastic."
Trump adds he would meet with Pope anytime so the Holy Father can learn more about immigration probs on US side.
Trump: I have a lot of respect for the Pope. He's doing a good job. He has a lot of energy.
Trump suggests Mexican government influenced Pope's statement about him
@andersoncooper has done a very good job engaging the candidates in real conversation. It's revealing.
Jeb: "People of my generation are more like Bill Clinton, they emote."
Jeb: "In public life you don't put faith in a lock box"
"How has your faith changed you?" Jeb Bush asked.
But Michael, isn't the Pope's message about welcoming the stranger something we elevate as well?  https://t.co/fTUugnuaIp
One thing to say for Trump, he will never use that phony line, "I don't pay attention to polls" https://t.co/knT4RYZ0aA
Fair enough. And the Pope was clear that he's not telling people who to vote for, nor should he. https://t.co/JzhDfCVvqm
This is a wonderful book. As a Jew, I wanted to learn more about Jesus. Father Martin teaches + shares his journey https://t.co/2ldHdKyjzT
How far Trumpism (and others who agree in GOP race) is from Bush in 2000: "Family values don't end at the Rio Grande."
This is a stunning rebuke by the Pope whose ministry of mercy for the poor and call 4 an attitude "conversion" tow. migrants has met new GOP
Thanks, as do you John. https://t.co/7W57VjDikS
Republicans Are Campaigning to Lose https://t.co/Tp51UL4Ns9
It's a @NewDay friends and I'll join the political conversation on the program (the town halls, SC )@ the top of the hour. @CNN @ChrisCuomo
I love that Rubio is brave enough to say he prefers West Coast rap over East Coast. #real
A good look at Marco Rubio's faith https://t.co/hfylLMgvvf
Rubio is good in this format. Seems like he's pressing less, more conversational.
Correction: I meant Rubio.
Cruz on Apple/encryption was honest and balanced. Admits it's going to take work and partnership to work this out with tech companies.
Now President Obama going to Cuba https://t.co/8ZqkoxZRqh
So true. I've never heard anyone say, "Don't touch my waste, fraud and abuse!" https://t.co/dhIQkHyNoV

+ for Jeb, brother issues rebuke of Trump. - for Jeb, Trump forcing review of Iraq. What r the leadership lessons ?  https://t.co/FLp8cAAO8y
Morning Twitter friends. I'll be on @NewDay at the top of the hour discussing President Bush in SC. Will he make a difference? @CNN
Thanks Josh! https://t.co/hWKDDJ3fEJ
But Jeb is taking him on and Cruz has launched a strong ideological hit on him.  https://t.co/x7b0pwjll8
Bush43 also speaks of Jeb's faith - his humility.... in a veiled jab at Trump's name calling.
President Bush backs brother with veiled jabs at Trump. Notably cautions against a leader who inflames anger rather than resolves it.
"Send me someone very smart.... Send me Elena Kagan." Interesting story about Scalia's advice to Obama WH https://t.co/KygyRN8dhI
Hey Los Angeles friends (that includes you Mom) I'm coming up on @KNX1070 to talk about the coming political fight after passing of Scalia
@LennyGreenblatt Thanks Lenny. I really enjoy joining the conversation on @NewDay - classy and smart program
Debate rips open GOP wounds, and party risks tearing itself apart https://t.co/IrOhKtEkyz https://t.co/kOTrvPR8wt
Agreed. Least of all Jeb. And yet legacy of Iraq is important for ISIS debate.  https://t.co/k8OSPnIZOm
This is great. Friendship, respect, love are bigger than ideological differences  https://t.co/mCV4hCPocE
Seems that Jeb has gotten under Trump's skin. Does this line v Bush specifically about Iraq help?  https://t.co/Zcd4TWVTOd
Coming up now on @NewDay to discuss Scalia politics
Death, the Prosperity Gospel and Me, via @nytimes https://t.co/ZkjjvlO1PC
Morning friends. It's a @NewDay + I'll be on this morn talking Scalia, SCOTUS politics, debate reaction and Bush 43 campaigning in SC @CNN
@LarryGustison1 Thank you Larry. I appreciate that.

A recess appt? To fill the Scalia seat on SCOTUS https://t.co/JR7EmQO9B6
WATCH @FoxNewsSunday this morning: interviews w Rubio and Sanders. And I join the round table to talk debate, Scalia and SC.
Def possible. And if Obama gets nominee thru GOP base will be similarly engaged in the Fall. Court future = big deal https://t.co/ZHP7FFWe2L
How many republican politicians have talked about nominating a justice in the mold of Scalia? Huge impact.
@JeffreyToobin points out that if Obama gets nominee thru senate tilts 5-4 majority to liberals @CNN
Makes the argument of who can win in Fall more imp in GOP race. Look for that in debate. Can Obama get candidate thru GOP senate?
@JeffreyToobin points out there will be heat on Senate to vote on an Obama nominee lest court be short handed for a year. @CNN
Big impact on the trail now. Will drive base of both parties and underline the stakes of the Court.  https://t.co/ajV736ZC44

Talking politics w the great @FrankBruni like we were on Bush campaign in 2000 https://t.co/0qh7opCas0
@newtgingrich 2/2 what effect does President Bush have in SC? Should he make the case against Trump?
@newtgingrich can you lay out how you see SC going given your win there in 2012? National security, appeals to evangelicals? And .... 1/2
He's very popular in the GOP and in the South.  https://t.co/2UFuiFd4P9
Aww, your nice. Trust me, I knew the news about me first ;) https://t.co/VdzrVo1Grz
Yep. I'm guessing he didn't realize in that moment that was a bad moment.  https://t.co/HzkMGrAZMk
Yeah? How's that going so far? You worried Trump isn't getting enough air time ? https://t.co/oLgjZNLMS8
It's true. Who is more likely to nuke Denmark ?  https://t.co/yq9RBnpboa
Well said Senator  https://t.co/rvXA9MjOjf
So Ari - does President Bush make a case against Trump in SC? I think that's the big question.  https://t.co/kwBwqrNvlP
Agree and he said off camera if he cratered in NH he was done.  https://t.co/XOcY6SBUtn
I do think Jeb deserves credit for his. He took on Rubio and Trump.  https://t.co/VojuCHMQb8
I get the irony - where does he win? And can be shake the caricature that he's created ? He also sees 2 be pressing  https://t.co/ouIXVXGgCh
David Gergen makes interesting point this morning: @HillaryClinton has to go to red states to get her campaign back on track.
Question for @JebBush - your brother will campaign for you for first im time in SC. What is the President Bush effect on this race? @NewDay
That's a great question. He doesn't rank as a second choice for most voters.  https://t.co/UAdZuJDOXj
Look Jeb to run a hard right ideological campaign in SC. Just like his brother in 2000 to beat McCain https://t.co/gkC9yXGCoE
Right. Trumps rivals haven't pressed him on specifics. He has faced those questions in debates. And on Twitter.  https://t.co/zaJKosIt2U
Nor will arguments suggesting his policies are fantasy https://t.co/b7e6RvK0Jg
@NTFLA_Politics @NewDay thank you Jim

Excuse me, Rubio running 5th, yikes.
What a GOP mainstream muddle. Rubio 3 in Ia, 3 in NH and little hope of winning SC in such a big field. Trump and Cruz are driving here
Is Bernie giving a State of the Union address?
Um, maybe, yeah.  https://t.co/5CIe9qwzNK
To @davidaxelrod s point - Sanders msg really is about voters, not himself. About those left behind in our system.
HRC takes the loss- and highlights her progressive side to take the race South. "I have work to do with young people."
HRC promises to reign in Wall St because "I KNOW HOW TO DO IT"
"I will work harder than anyone to make changes" - HRC
How will Hillary address/spin this loss?

Paging @RonBrownstein how indicative are NH indie voters of indie voters nationwide?
Huge news for Trump and Sanders. Now what happens to the GOP establishment tonight? Waiting ....
Fear is not strength.  https://t.co/bDlx5YV43Q
Also true: team Clinton underestimated Obama in 2008 and  Sanders in 2016. He's strong and getting stronger.
Trump wins NH. Strong 2 in Iowa. He's real. Clear front runner. And if field stays big it only helps him.
@CNN projects Trump and Sanders win NH. 2016 is not your father's campaign.

Whether debate attack on Rubio helps him, Christie camp believes he changed the GOP race

Strong second half for Rubio - made strong stands on life, Clinton, fighting ISIS.  https://t.co/w0rodYQH0K
Good point made @jonkarl that Kasich is making good pitch to Indy voters w positive message tonight.
Don't disagree actually about demeanor just think he hasn't been visible tonight.  https://t.co/yCew2aqAyB
Kasich less visible tonight not good for him so close to the vote.
Rubio wants to put prisoners back into Gitmo not empty it. #ABCDebate
Cruz: targeted carpet bombing.
Rubio refuses to engage Christie training his fire on President. Calculation is he can ignore him but Christie is scoring points.
Jeb and Christie coming up big so far. Trump up and down. Telling Bush "be quiet" finger to lips is a new low in a presidential debate
Rubio weak when making a process argument on immigration. Christie strong when underlining what a leader does. #ABCDebate
I think we've established that Christie will be harder on Rubio than North Korea #ABCDebate
I think Trump missed the irony of the Rubio "Obama knows what he's doing" line repeated 3 x
Yeesh  https://t.co/2O7DVmgk1M
I'm not clear Senator Rubio, does the President know what he's doing? #ABCDebate
Rubio has to take his opposition down not try to play big right now #ABCDebate
