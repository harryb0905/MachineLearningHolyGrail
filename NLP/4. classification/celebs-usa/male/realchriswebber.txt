Oooooooooooooh...“@bighouse1990: @realchriswebber DWade goes home to Chicago now?”
Breaking News- after hearing leBron's back Bone Thugs and harmony- men at large and the O'Jays, are in the studio recording new albums.
I still say the @HoustonRockets should not sign Bosh- I don't feel he's a good fit -unless it's to bring a experience to locker room.
True brah! “@davidranier: Dan Gilbert is still a jerk for what he said about Lebron. This does not change that for me”
I'm happy for @KingJames and his family.....as long as THEY are happy.. #livenow
Not talking about anyone- state of reporting -journalism- ass kissing to get next interview- loud character assassination - silent apologies
Who me:) Haaaaaaaa“@downwithdetroit: @realchriswebber you know all too well about character assassination. Keep 'em in check CWebb!”
Funny -when fake experts -observers -flip flop ...AFTER- character assassination- I'm watching-this is funny-
Ive taken note of those who said @KingJames would be stupid / not a leader- if he left- one of his bashers is on TV now saying good move
What's funny is watching "fake insiders" change their tone!
What do you think about the Cavs and the king now?
