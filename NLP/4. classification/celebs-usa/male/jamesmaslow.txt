Today I’m taking a page out of my boy @MikeOHearn ‘s book and searching for my “why”. Ya I’m heading to the gym and have a full day of work set up but that’s routein for me. I need to find the reason why I’m going to step it all up even further. Start looking for yours too 💪🏼😎
Just looked through some comments of a photo I posted with my girlfriend and I’m super disappointed in all the hate. Also sad. Not for me, for those people who are so sad or angry or bored that they try and bring other people down. Hope you guys find happiness one day #spreadlove
@AviiGmz U rock. I owe u 2 cupcakes now ;)

@Moniquikiki Right?! Life...
@Miri_Rusher Happy bday!!
Just being 28 over here with a pimple that’s been here for a month. Cool
@brimoniq @ChrystalMaslow @Maslover72 Nah just annoyed today at all the skinny leg comments haha. I do have skinny calves but it’s ok. My legs are strong and I work them out all the time. I used to want to be in shape IN SPITE of people bullying me but now it is very much DESPITE that. I train for me. My goals. 👍🏼
@_nadine4 I agree. Weight varies-different for different people and “healthy” is a spectrum. But a lot of people just aren’t educated on what to do in order to attain their health/fitness goals. I think I want to join a chairlift-especially one focusing on kids to encourage healthy habits
@wdwcastaway Yeahhhhhh 😎
@kendallsfunfair Amen
@CrzyKendallGrl Agreed. BE NICE is the key here. Kindness is contagious in the best of ways 😁
@nikkilovescf I can only imagine. But my point is that we need to lift each other up. Encourage. Motivate. Fitness is one example but this should apply to everything. 😊 I sincerely hope you have an awesome day!
@blue4t Hell ya! Keep it up! Super proud of you
@Auslly12 Yes feel great and encourage others to do the same! Exercise is one of the best ways to do that 😄
@waffletoast215 By who’s standards? Clinical obesity in the US is an epidemic. We need to educate and support each other. Sad that people try and tear down the few of us that are putting in the work to be healthy and inspire

@spearsboi @cottonmouth251 Today I’m in MI filming my new action movie Wolf Hound. Yesterday I was in Mexico City filming my new comedy My Boyfriend’s Meds. Next LA then Miami then Vegas for music and TV 📺
@CzarneckiIi Love that keep it up!
@brimoniq Maybe...but I’d rather know love lost than never know love at all
@LeeWalker75 Money helps alleviate a lot of problems that cause stress-no question. But money alone doesn’t bring happiness. I know a lot of super rich super depressed people. Connection-friendship-passion/purpose. All more important than money. But let’s work hard for it all!
Haha love this! You both look great 😃 https://t.co/XzOfqV4d0f https://t.co/UK7YoZXkzQ
@rachelLlovee Ah too bad just met some fans at my boxing gym this morning!
@cottonmouth251 Haha ya it has been nuts I’m on set in MI today!
Happiness is a choice. One that takes work. It’s easy to feel sorry for yourself. It’s a lot harder to take accountability for the reasons why you aren’t happy and work to change them. But you should. I try daily. But again, nobody said being happy is easy. But it is worth it 😃
I fucking love Mexico! Thank you to all my crazy and amazing fans here and worldwide for supporting me. Y’all ain’t seen nothing yet. New music coming your way super soon 😉🎶🇲🇽 @ Camino… https://t.co/D4frvcOt8F

So James is a target for a back door nomination. #BBCeleb
Remember guys, while James is in the house, all social media is being run by #TeamMaslow
I’d say James is more than just eye candy. #BBCeleb
We all know what happened to the pie #BBCeleb
Everyone needs to be bags in! #BBCeleb
And let’s be real, James loves the gym. #BBCeleb
Anyone catch those sweet dance moves?  #BBCeleb
Let’s just go with #Celebrators #BBCeleb
Chuck + James = #TeamLidLow #BBCeleb
Not knowing what is in the gift bag till nominations... this smells like trouble. #BBCeleb

Hey #TeamMaslow , let’s remember to keep things in the positive. Not everyone has to like everyone but there is no need for hate or personal attack just because of someone’s opinion of someone else.
@LizzyMaslow_ the only place for livestreams is on CBS all access.
Once we get more information we will share it. Right now that is all the info we can share.

@SaadePussparej 😁😁😁
@Maslover231015 It’s out of my control now so I don’t know but it’s in the system and should be very soon!
The #HowILikeItRemix is uploaded it’s just being slow to show up! Sorry guys, but I promise it will be there soon! Until then check my IG story for another sneak peak 🤘🏼
@kendallsfunfair Sometimes the upload is early or late but it should be soon! 😬
@MelmelMaslow16 Sometimes certain platforms take longer...always annoying sorry! I’m as anxious as you guys!
@zjmsxhmidt Thanks pops!

I sing in the kitchen sitting on my kitchen island. I sing in the shower. I sing in my car. On occasion I sing in the studio or on stage but this is really my bread and butter...also I don’t eat a lot of bread and butter so I’m not sure this is the best saying for this? https://t.co/Hh8WDM7HY3

@AndreaLomeliFra Oh no Sam is much more talkative haha
@MaslowxPuth Sam is a punk. Street brawler and petty thief who tries to take on a job way over his head. But he’s smart...you’ll never see the twist in this movie coming
@Miri_Rusher Haha kind of love this
What a weekend. #themovieHEART is going to be epic. Will share the “trailer/scene” we shot once it’s ready. I think you’ll all agree that these characters need to be on the big screen!
@JMSupport_27 So it’s a proof of concept. Yes that’s the name but this weekend of filming is to sell it, get a lot more money and then go and do it for real! Such a rad script-kind of like Snatch meets Smokin Aces
@eileen_frydberg So Rad. Plenty more coming soon 😁
@ChrystalMaslow Solid list
@MikeOHearn Not going to lie they weren’t horrible yesterday but they’re wrecked today!
Was up at 5, full day of filming something badass I’ll tell you about one day, now at the gym blasting Stevie Wonder, crushing legs and thinking about how awesome 2018 already is. Sorry if you’re hungover...I wouldn’t want to read this tweet if I was hungover

I truly love connecting to my fans on here but sometimes I need a little break from social media. To capture memories, not photos. To be social, without the media. But I’m alive and well and will be back on it all well, now. 😋

I’m lucky to have a lot of friends but the older I get the less I need that. I much prefer a handful of great ones and those people already know who they are. So 2018 is dedicated to more time with those who fully reciprocate that love. 🤙🏼

Texting a girl is like cat sitting for your buddy. Sometimes the cat is super attentive and loving and then all of a sudden you just can’t find the cat. Not under the couch, not in the hamper - shit did Fluffy get out? Totally not an outdoor cat...Billy is going to be pissed.

@BTR_Alice So rad. Fans like you inspire me to do more and be better. Let's go!
@Niklynn Killer choice in music ma friend
