@iKORNELIOS I would absolutely love that opportunity 🙏🏾
Has anyone else notice that Kyler Fackell has 10.5 sacks?
Was the grab before the top? Pi or no? #KCvsSEA
@WillBlackmon Bro he jumped that check down lol
Wow major push off wipe.
Touchdown
Keep your face mask out of your catch😀
@WillBlackmon I was all over that lol
https://t.co/pQqYzS2xYg
His front leg drag to outer bounds before the second touched down   #SAINTSVSSTEELERS
Sometimes you need to shake the tree to receive the fruit. Don’t give up don’t you ever give up🙏🏾 https://t.co/56d6LcjRBB
@Insanecane99 Great coach! Great friend! When one door closes god always opens another one. It was a absolute pleasure learning from one of the best.
Although I grew to hate AP when he was in Minneapolis with the Vikes you have to respect the man he is a beast!!! And still is
@noahsarkcrypto 🧐 mmmm
@super_mario_x True lol I respect Tyson because he got his butt up
@NFL @tae15adams I think he is too!!! It’s not a problem to know your worth if it’s accurate
If someone knocked you out twice in a fight do you feel you won even if you got more punches? #WildervsFury
Sorry #Showtime but Pauli is super off base for those comments!! To put Ggg vs Canleo in the same boat as this fight???? Really?????
The heavy weight division just got a rebirth!!
It’s incredible what you can accomplish with determination!! https://t.co/5lShBqfb6n
Sometimes you doubt yourself because you hit a hurdle but then you remember no one that has accomplished something great did with out overcoming an obstacle... don’t believe me research your fav successful person. #Truth 🧐
@cbakerswaggy Bro keep working you about to get yours again!!! You are a baller and great teammate
Phil with the win 😳 https://t.co/Ui0WC8sMdb
Things just got serious on the back 9  #TheMatch https://t.co/kH8b4U7ZcW
Phil very accurate off the tee box today #TheMatch https://t.co/HqzjB5cBdT
Side sauce #TheMatch https://t.co/bTxIJDeZ7b
Phil scared to bet #TheMatch https://t.co/eYES8bwKm0
Watching #TigerVSPhil  betting all this money got me like... https://t.co/UC8Q1j7BNK
@Insanecane99 I was very impressed of the work ethic and the ablitity to stay true to who he is as a player but yet add from the great coaching I watched first hand this off season, that not only he learned but me as well!!!
@Insanecane99 Bro that’s right out of gods mouth!!! The truth!!!!
@BradyPoppinga Thanks brother love you hope the fam is good!!!

Not going to lie I feel so bad for Dez Bryant..... I hope he has some good people in his corner
Just seen 3 fighter jets land in GreenBay going to be a sick flyover Tom!!! God bless our armed forces
@Dbeaumonte06 @SouthwestAir If anyone every disrespect you let me know I will ride because you are one of the best people I know?!!
We still are in the first couple games of a new coordinator but the energy need to be aggressive and angry
Speed anit speed without going north and south!!! Make them go easy and west
Speed kills but I know a guy by the name of Al Harris who could cover a guy faster then him you know how bump and run!!! Patience
See what happens when Fitz has time to throw it.....
Offense can stiff arm you right to your face jarring your neck so violently but defense can’t even gently tackle a QB?
All for one one for all??? Or naw lol lol
@PrideOCucamonga Like this is very puzzling to me.... it actually looks a lil thirsty
So... would Hall of Fame players still be Hall of Fame with out their teammates?
@StevieJohnson13 That portrait filter lol
That’s what I like to see!!! My boy @NickTheGreat8 had his brother @ClayMatthews52 back!!!! That’s how the LBs do in the BAY!!!! But y’all had me stressed out in the box thou lol....

Lake Tahoe is beautiful can’t believe how clear the water is. 👌🏾 https://t.co/L20v3vq9lK
Don’t be a dam on your own water source, you know happens when you do that? You become thirsty! 🧐
@FimsTreez13 No that’s why I was asking the question.
We be so worried about the misdirection we forget where the ball carrier is!!! Center your life focus on the right
So Urban Meyer is being suspended because he didn’t know about someone else’s life?
@shawnemerriman 100!!!
I don’t know if y’all been watching or not but those Packers OLBs are playing with a sense of urgency!!! https://t.co/LaZcIo3ecZ
Another weak heavy wieghg fight in the ufc 😣
Last couple days hanging with Greenbay greats has been awesome #PackersHalloffame #Packers
Has been absolute blast coaching the last two days. The young guys are coming along fine much work still ahead but the guys seem up to the task!
@ajwilliams23 Man there’s still snow coming down now!!
@cbakerswaggy Don’t brother I seen you work!! On the field and off the field you are a beast!!! Keep doing you!
I sure miss having built in friends while playing in the NFL. Once you don’t play anymore the majority of your good teammates disappear. 🤷🏽‍♂️😫
Fly eagles fly!!!! Congrats Dougie!!! Once a packer always a packer!!!
If you want your linebackers to play like relentless robots that attack ball carriers then hire one to coach them... I'm free 😳😂
@MyFavePacker He's defensive mind is versatile. He can run 4-3 defense 3-4 defense he has been in the coaching tree of some of the most successful schemes
Would love to see Winston Moss as the next defensive coordinator in Greenbay
Man I am so jealous of the NBAs players only deal... man how awesome would it be for the #NFL to have a players only channel 🙏🏽
So biggest Packer off-season move? And Biggest Buffalo move?
@_dough21 @oscarsinger Correction 😀
1738 😳
@jasonjwilde Nick Barnett from his couch in Carlsbad 🙋🏽‍♂️
No fans at this bowl game in Hawaii. People wonder why they moved the probowl from there. 🤷🏽‍♂️
I am sorry but the playoffs are not the same with out the Packers. It just anit right 💁🏽‍♂️
Wow did Addidas just directly go at Big baller brand? Interesting
@AaronNagler That whole coaching staff put in some major work!
Two over time wins 💪🏽 Packers got something going boy #Magic

Don't Sabotage your personal growth!
Nice week of football Packers and Bills won 💪🏽
These white unis are sick!!!
People are mad because people are asking for equality? Ummmm ok
@AlexTallitsch I don't think so!
@RapSheet Prob the worst defensive game as well lol
@BradyPoppinga Drugs? Sniffing glue? Lol be careful with that are they will start saying pain killers cause CTE instead of all the concussions lol
Prob the most entertaining but suspect NFL Thursday game I have ever seen.
Some of y'all need to stop faking your someone else on social media how bout being yourself stop the false advertisement! We anit buying!
@RobYarber I just hit 692 series yesterday you got me getting serious now lol
@RobYarber You anit about that life lol
I don't know if it's protection or coverage but something anit right. #Packers
What a come back!! Great win for the Pac-12 Bruins....
So many issues to comment about but I think I'll just sit over here with my pinky up lol 💁🏽‍♂️☕️
@kristenmckinn3y Or in other words be a hoe lol 😀
Put some perm on your attitude you need to relax 💁🏽‍♂️😂
@kristenmckinn3y lol
@LibbyLu30 another hater 😂
Maybe next year 💛💚
You know what would have been awesome if I could have announced the packers 29th pick since I was the 29th pick 😀😒
You can go head a make having fun a habit for your kid! I on the other hand will try to make winning a habit for mine! Have a good day
The worst weakness is the weakness to realize you have a weakness
Gratefulness is lost
Did finding Tom Brady's jersey save lives or prevent terror attacks?
Things aren't looking good on both sides of the table right now.  We need to get it together. All around left side right side and all around
@PTTF_Brian @CUREHDSAORG that's great to here. I bet there's another 10K out of work as well..  there's a lot more that can be down here
@kelgamel thanks for the heads up
@kelgamel the packer symbol?
@jakoppel did I say I needed a job? 🤑
@TrevorKurak is it a American company?
@CUREHDSAORG they certainly would up there on that list.
Less fortunate 👇🏽
Starbucks talking about they will hire 100k refugees. How bout they hire some of our less unfortunate Americans 🤓
I think it is very awesome how everyone is coming together to protest trumps decisions. But where was everyone on Election Day?

@miguellem90 @Jon__Bradley I agree but still got that ass whooped!
@miguellem90 I Judo is one thing. Getting punched in your face is another 😀. Good night buddy sorry for your heroes lost!
This is how my pockets feel after paying close to 80 dollars to watch this fight good night enjoy!! Come back 🐸☕️ https://t.co/4UwV4L5tlB
@miguellem90  that's all great and all... but no matter what she was over rated from day 1 she may have built it base on looks not skill. ✊🏽
My Moma would have whooped Rousey!! No lie!! Lol
@Dajones19 I didn't kill her she killed her own career!! 😂 I wouldn't go so hard if she would have made it to 1 min lol
So... y'all watching come back part 2 or naw??? Lol 💣
@DuJuan_Harris it look like she has never thrown or avoided a punch ever in her in entire life!! Lol but hey come back part 2???
@tsmithND she didn't even know how to avoid one punch!! Who the hell is this coach??? Lol
@DuJuan_Harris or 3!!
All those great training videos lol get out of here!! You are not about that life!! She had the nerve to call out Floyd Money May really ?
Maybe it was PTSD. It look like she had a flash back of the Holly fight!! Lol
@muehlberg85 she needs to figure something out because that looked like she had no clue at all about what she was doing or where she was
UFC talking about the come back!! What?? Come back to reality!! Someone needs to get that girl some milk
@Tfont bro I know strippers that would have whooped her ass
@muehlberg85 I don't think I could've help her lol
@KristiJohnson5 who ever it was that need to work on defense
That girl need to get checked for CTE she got pounded out... that's real talk 🚑
@miguellem90 yea I thought that after the first fight she lost but after that last fight she need to get checked for CTE
Ronda is done!! That was worst performance I have ever seen from such a highly regarded fighter!! Wow wow wow

No surprise there!!! They been running that ball up the middle every time!!!
Dropped balls out a stop to that drive followed by missed kick... miss opportunities are starting to pile up for the Pack.. #snf
Wow wind must be really bad cause that was horrible🌬🌬💨#SNF
😂😂😂😂
That wouldn't have been called if it was Cam Newton
@am6517 yes #48 was getting beasted as well
@klabel12 😳lol
Lbs need to get off blocks and make plays!!
Right thru the heart of the defense!!
Cousin missing his check downs very consistently right now
Well besides all the other stuff great job by Rodgers hanging in there and finding Jordy after having his helmet almost ripped off #GBvsWAS
Was that a catch?
🙄
😑
@COFFEECOWal @nxthan @ChorleyBucs real baller right there!!!
A real back and forth 1st quarter. Not sure if both defenses are playing extremely good or both offenses are starting pretty slow #SNF #GB
@kristenmckinn3y whoa??
@CrawDoggy maybe.. just don't remember her making racist comments that's all
@SayHelloToAndy I would have no issue with it if she didn't use a picture of a castration device
When you voted for Trump you had to know if he won it would divide the country in some aspect.
@YoungJebrey it was a form of punishment to slaves. With everything going on it's hard not to feel some kind of way.
@YoungJebrey maybe... lol
@KeithBM true lol
@KeithBM easy to say when it's not your history right?
@YoungJebrey yea I thought so... just remember reading about slaves being put thru that same device so it maybe touch me differently
@SayHelloToAndy it's crazy that wasn't made into a big deal thou.. lol if Sherman posted something like that in reverse😱

It was a pretty good weekend of packer family kids and football!! @JermichaelF88 @Bostick11 @Wellefast https://t.co/nD0a4bf5o5
End result: parents wrong, zoo wrong and gorilla dies! No one wins! Blame who you may won't bring him back so let's fix both sides
@thenickdenunzio fair enough, it's all good till its your kid that escapes your gaze for two seconds and decides to play with lions lol
The number 1 responsibility of a zoo is to keep the animal safe, or to keep the people coming to see the animals safe?
Who are the main attendees to the zoo? I'll take a guess maybe I am not right but .... KIDS???
@klevernapkin make it harder for a 4 year old to climb into a gorilla cage lol
@klevernapkin #commonsense would be don't make a way to climb into to a dangerous animals cage! So on both sides I agree
How many adults watched that kid climb and didn't do shit!!! It takes a village people!!!
If you take your kids to the zoo you expect it to be kid friendly correct?
@klevernapkin really? 98% percent of parents I know have lost there kids for 5 mins are more.. Grocery store or whatever
@sjilzian80 no parent in America can say they never lost there kid for 5 mins!!
The parents should be looking in to sueing the zoo!!! There should be no way for a kid to get in to a dangerous animals cage
Talking all this about should they or shouldn't they have shot the gorilla.. First of all maybe the zoo should fixed how the kid got in
@GBPackers1v that's fake
@PackQueen @jaricadavis lol
@BUrlacher54 I see you bro!! Best investment is in yourself and family 😀

Can't go wrong with a good O-Line pick...
Exactly my point!! They could have got Josh Norman talent for a fraction of the cost! Good for the Jags! https://t.co/VnrViN8iqY
Well in my book corner is more valuable then a running back in today's game... #justsaying
@naildiggs exactly way to many needs missed with that pick! #justsaying
I like Bosa as a player but not this high. Not a knock on him but just think that's a high pick for him.

So you say it exist in every race? So is the racism equal then? Equal between whites black Hispanics Asians etc?
@bjohnson613 well yes, do you think it is equal to every race??
@HollywoodAdrian I just find it funny when people really believe that it doesn't exist!! I am mixed and have seen numerous times
I really wanna know do you guys believe there is still racism or do you think we are all treated the same? Really?

Wow
Wow the protection is looking incredible right now.. The out of pocket magic is making a come back
Another crossing route 👀👍🏽
Agree that last play was great protection  https://t.co/z3l3Gm5ttG
Crossing route? 😀
We have a lil momentum going into this 4th quarter. I would like to see some deep crossing routes. Attack Newman
When Rodgers scrambles he just doesn't have the same magic right now. Need to find that quick

That's a lil bad technique and lil lack of aggression 😱 https://t.co/bcRIORxNIw
🤐📞☎️📟 https://t.co/fvpWJHzkwz
At least the o-line got something out of that play because that gave Rodgers a century of time back there!
💀 whoa megaton is back 🤖 #GBvsDET
Good thing because right now defense is not playing well!! I seen to coverage assignments blown on that drive alone https://t.co/w7cGJIj0it

Brett still looks like he can play!!! Absolute Best QB I played with!! Still love Rodgers thou !!! #ThanksFavre
Special teams to the rescue!!! #GBvsCHI
Big mishap!! Raining not the cause of that fumble. It got a lil too far away from his body. Defense time to earn the pay check #GBvsCHI
Such hate from a Bear lol!! https://t.co/EYqAUOJ5IS

That's exactly what they did not want to happen!!! Don't wanna let them score before the half! #BUFvsNE
Stay tuned folks this game has the making of a Game of the year!!! #BUFvsNE
Wow huge missed opportunity but wow what a throw by  T squared #BillsMafia
Buffalo Defense is playing to their potential!! #BillsMafia
@robertjmartin6 I loved to play against certain players. Dominic Riola was one of them for the lions
@pwojahn34 @bdei80 what I am saying is I am willing to bet my salary that I would be better then 86 percent of Lbs on the field now 💯
@bdei80 I think if a team puts me on the roster they would want me on the field. I def couldn't play special teams at this point
That's a good question for the NFL teams. 😀 still got the speed strength knowledge, so:..  https://t.co/NqGyuOWDFw
The #Packer defense made me proud they played with purpose and aggression reminded me of myself #GoPackGo https://t.co/o8oAiYK4VY
Off to Kids baseball practice I got the game recording I'll holla later my evaluation 🤓
Packers are pounding the ball! 1,2 punch Eddie Lacey and Starks
With the Lions beating the Raiders makes me feel a lil better about the state of the Packers. #PackerThought
Good things happen when you try to stretch the field. It's like having good 3 point shooters in basketball.
No time for Rodgers... Everyone on the line was beat in some fashion on that play
The swarm is in full effect today!!! That's how you play Defense!! #GoPackGo
That's the Griminess I was talking about!! #GbvsMin
Rumbling tumbling Eddie Lacy looks like Eddie Lacy!! #GBvsMIN
Lady's and gentleman we have a sighting of pressure !!! #GoPackGo
Well that would work too!! Anger!! Physicality.. Aggression... Etc etc  https://t.co/INIqG7nO6t
I know sometimes fans don't like it but I would like to see a lil more "griminess" in this Packer Defense.
Miscommunication Miscommunication and more Miscommunication #GbvsMin
It was until he misjudge ball undercut with out being in position to make solid tackle if he missed  https://t.co/nihGZFWaLz
Battle royal 💪🏽 https://t.co/DnQjTIAKtz
Bad decision and poor technique   https://t.co/wHI0MjtRpe
Maintain your running gaps.. Don't get nosey or AD with take advantage.
Nice drive. Was lil worried about the 3-1 play call. Seem to be a lil too slow developing play for my taste. #GBvsMIN
@GBPackers_Diva that just might make the difference 😝
It's almost game time!!!! Man it's bout to go down!!
Shooting a Q&amp;A after today's packers games please send video questions to gbfivesix@gmail.com
Defense has to play today for them to even have chance  https://t.co/fs6fY5s6Sr

@King_Kongbo yea your home awaits you 😀
People ask me all the time why you go so hard! I tell them everyday it's a different reason. Today.... Was about missing being on the field

Lots of plays looking like they need flags 👀🕵 #GBsvCAR
Big play for the Packers defense if call is upheld !! #GoPackGo could have even been pass intervene on offense
@Brussjr at home on madden 😉
Bad feet at the line lead the WR to get inside position. #technique
That was more of a flop then a flag #Packers
Bills looking good right now with TT back!! #BillsMafia
Sure could use @JermichaelF88 right now thou !! #GoPackGo
Bout time Cobb !! #GoPackGo
The blitz package must be really good or the O-line is sleep right now #Packers
Packers in a major struggle right now. Hopefully they go in locker room and come out ready to play next half. Defense especially

Thomas is getting off early!! Shields out right now it's not looking good.. Might need to double him 👀
Rare boot by Peyton got Em #GBvsDEN

I think Scott Chandler likes being in this NE Patriots offense.. Making plays out there. #NEvsNYJ
Huge stop by Buffalo after that major turnover
No communication in headset seems to work better for EJ..
Goal line stop here is huge!! Confidence and momentum builder now can that offense get off the goal line without a safety? #BUFvsJAX
Big mistake by Nigel.. Must stay in coverage
Well at this moment I can't but he still has time to redeem himself in the 2nd half. With no replacement has to!! https://t.co/3ndeujkcYn
Buffalo offense is starting to look a bit better, that's not saying much given how it start #bills #JAXinUK

That's was a good battle! Packers have been tested the last two weeks and came out on top. Wasn't pretty but got the job done! 👏🏾
James Jones has been absolute clutch for the Packers really great to see him back.. My turn?? Lol 😂
This will be a major blow if Allen can't finish this! Looks like something happened with his HipFlexor!
We have a real game on our hands folks!! #Packers #Chargers If the packers want to win they will need to stop Allen!! Just a thought 🙇🏿🙇🏽🙇🏻
Never mind 😀.. Short
I think that might be a Touchdown... Allen is having one hell of a drive..
Wow outstanding two plays by Allen! Good defense both plays just better effort by Allen #Packers #Chargers #NFL

@matthewcgeorge well hey looks like you might know it all.. How come I have never heard of you before? 😉
@matthewcgeorge only one season with over 100 tackles!? False Twitter beef? 4th and 26? Ha Your a joke dude

With all that said great play by Kam! Period!!
The ball was batted forward not backwards  https://t.co/2ftmKpU0j6
Any thing in the End zone should be reviewed! Just like all scoring plays.. Wait didn't they review where the fumble occurred?
I agree but I knew it!! Refs are paid high dollar to know it!!  https://t.co/2mIcDTBwfi
I can't really say it was Seattle cheating but man there is always some home cooking going on there!! 🍳🍳
Yes true but it seems the refs always mess up there lol  https://t.co/dODuyQ2ujD

@yt2dope I think what played a bigger part in slowing Lebron down! Was no Irving and no love. Just my opinion!
No Curry no win, no iggy still Possiable to win series. That's all am saying congrats to the Warriors thou!! California Champs!!
@p_lib @andre love him! And agree he was a difference maker in this finals but I still think Curry on the court made the major difference
@yt2dope if it was on defense then Darymond Green was in the running???
@miguellem90 did you not see the constant trap on curry!!!?? He occupied two every time he touched the ball!! Did you missed that???
26 points per game in finals with constant double team and no M.V.P no discredited Iggys contribution but really!!??

@PatskriegDotCom maybe... But I believe cheating is cheating.. People risking there health for a fair shot at winning the game.. #notfair
It wouldn't have been a thing if they weren't already caught cheating in the past #SpyGate  https://t.co/XEb2c5K8gM
@Crptmuncher I said if he is guilty go back and read thru!
@GregBousnakis they were also found cheating on couple of those games correct 😜 #spygate
Ok am done on the topic!! Until further review lol ...
@GregBousnakis when you cheat this game you disrespect everyone who ever wore the shield! That's just #MyOpinion
@Crptmuncher doesn't matter.. If you cheat you need to be punished if your caught and they were... Lol
Bounty gate by far.. Hurting people for money is by far a worst offense #MyOpinion  https://t.co/8AuP07eeLq
@PatskriegDotCom he was suspended correct?
👀 yea right lol https://t.co/DZ14qDDeqY
I feel like if this was any other player besides Tom Brady discipline would have already be handed out! #MyOpinion
@Crptmuncher I didn't say it had anything to do with blow out but sure it made Tom feel better throwing!! Also it's cheating!
@Crptmuncher did colts deflate the ball?
@TheDomValenti Pitchers in Mlb are fined suspended for messing with the baseballs correct? What's different here???
@TheDomValenti by the NFL and that is the government that governs Players!! Using performance enhancing drugs is cheating! So is deflating
@TheDomValenti cheating is illegal as well!! 😉
@nutgoat they have punished players for less!
@TheDomValenti so your saying he should not be punished for cheating??? Really???
If Tom Brady guilty then he should face the same consequences as someone on performances enhancing drugs!!! 4 game suspension for cheating
@jonj04 really ? Cast no stone?

Feels a lil like 2007 NFC championship game!
I bet they wish they had those red zone touchdowns instead of field goals. That fake field goal didn't help either.. Wow so close!!
This year ex special teams coach Morton moved to Seattle. I wonder if he had something to do with that fake there 👀
Rain coming down hard now thinking its time to get back to running the ball? Or naw???
The only 12th man I see effecting the game is the man that is wearing number 12! Great job By the Packers coming into a hostile environment
Great three points be still must score touchdown in redzone..
Flags are flying today!! Lack of discipline on that Seattle defense so far!!
“@IAMANITABAKER: Need that pass rush... Mr Rodgers got enough time to make Pancakes”--Even Ms Baker knows what's up lol
“@TonyDungy: GB is playing bump and run M-M defense and the Seahawks receivers are not getting open.” -They came to Play
Good job by 29 flipping his hips in that coverage..
Turnt up here!!! Lol http://t.co/OrDne6b0cn
Real balanced offense they got going right!!! 11runs 12 pass...
That's the way to run the ball !!! Eddie out there lacing them up!!
Would be a great time to get that run going on offense for Packers. I wonder if they rotate the backs this drive ? 👀
Looks like that Packer defense came to play today!!
Need to score in the red zone.. Miss two big opportunities there. Great Stops by Seahawks D.

Crosby does have experience kicking wet soggy balls 👀 it's good
Get the field goal going into the half... How big was that missed field goal? Now let's make sure it's not a soggy kick here !!
Nice spin move by the young kid!
@Crob4452 still ready
That was even worst then before!!! It's hard kicking a frozen soggy ball!!! #ThatsWhatSheSaid lol
You guessed it!!! I was right!!! Lol
I don't if that yellow line was wrong on my tv but that didn't look like a correct spot 👀 #NFLPlayoffs
@CP308 I did miss opening drive lol
@JasonHoward1983 yes I did miss opening drive lol
My opinion right now but I like the way Starks has been running this game can we go with hot hand?
Starks looks motivated today!! Run hard but hold on to ball!!
I think Rodgers held that looking for a deeper opportunity after he saw flag... Heads up football..

Packers moving on all cylinders but have to capitalize when they get down there in the redzone.. But keeping Brady off field 👌
Here comes hard count
That's good defense! Can't front #revis
Nice way to get Cobb on a miss match! Hide him in the back field
Clay can't take that back side gap vs counter.. Unless you make the play.. Leaves the front side LB on island
That looks like a stinger!
Adams may have a big day! #yathink?
@Berzirk maybe still looking to play one more year maybe two lol
Big body on big body with Browner Vs Nelson should be a match up to watch
Looks like @Akeem_Ayers has found a nice new home!! Regardless of penalty good speed and finish on that play
NE using motion when Clay is at the inside lb position hoping to get him thinking more then just playing.

Don't be tweeting me deep tweets when your avatar is your Butt!!! What!!?? 🐴
@NickUDurhamite So your saying that no athletes are Brave?
Football safety is very important! We need to protect each other by protecting ourselves..   Rip Damon Janes
Ok well that was fun guys have a good night and GOD bless!! Remember it's just football Smile!!! 😬
“@tjiacono: @NickBarnett you're kidding right? Its football.”--That's what I been trying to say all day!
Why is NFL special?? Not everyone can do it! It's a "Dangerous Sport Played By Dangerous or Brave Individuals With extraordinary Talent!"
We still allow stiff arms to the face. In my opinion that's dangerous to both head and Neck.
“@Berzirk: @NickBarnett The stiff-arm to the head needs to be eliminated. Unfair, one-sided, &amp; dangerous. It's a penalty if defense does it”
My point of bringing all this up was for you to put your self in these players shoes...
I have had both before I can tell you that both equally are not fun!!! ACL- Concussion... With everything great there are risk!
I wish I had solution. I don't. I do think @nflcommish is doing a good job trying to protect both the game and players.. Much to be done
@Shakehitch only if we could make it for 30 years
“@powerbombme: @NickBarnett two wrongs don't make a right”-- Well said!!
“@KevinTreichel: @NickBarnett brains &gt; legs”--- it seems logical but ask players they rather have a concussion then ACL 🙇
@JJ_Levesque Not every player makes millions! The majority don't
@tonymission Maybe not now but down the line that money prob could have helped my kids, mother, brother or someone in need
So many issues with player safety! Don't hit up high. But yet you let 310 plus lineman dive at my legs while my focus is on ball? 🙇
The money you make is suppose to carry you thru the rest of your life.. So actually one week could actually mean 15 years!!! 👀
I understand rules are rules and players safety comes first.. A NFL career averages 3 years...
How would you feel if you lost a weeks pay for trying to do your job to the best of your ability?
People are so gun Ho about having someone lose there week of pay really!!?? Would you like to lose yours!!!??? #ThinkAboutIt
@thecooleyzone Gross!!!! Taco johns yuk lol

@CaptOTM I haven't been to stadium in a awhile ill call the guys wants I get back in the states
The biggest problem tonight was rush lanes.. With a running QB you wanna keep him inside the pocket mix in pressure..
@mwkraut ok dummy what did I say?

As far as coaching search I am a fan of all the candidates.. Def like Lovie Smith..
Wish we were playing tonight!! #Bills With @RussBrandon in charge we will be next year!! #kissingmybossbutt lol
By any account great half by the Packers.
This half has made a great case for the value of Ponder for Vikes.. Or is Pack D that much better with Charles Woodson
A lil bit of a push off there #justbeinghonest
Important drive to end this half.. Especially with the Pack getting the ball starting second half. Score vs Make sure your opponent does not
“@TheMind_ofDK: @NickBarnett Shut your bitch ass up.  #Traitor #BillsMafiaMyAss”--- Where did this come from?? #Internettoughguy
