Not a bad way to start night one of @NBCTheVoice. I’d say I’m getting the hang of it, wouldn’t you agree @adamlevine @blakeshelton @kelly_clarkson? #VoicePremiere
.@kelly_clarkson sure sure 😒 #VoicePremiere
Well, well, well… my first artist on @NBCTheVoice and it’s the 1st Four Chair of the season. The other coaches may be feeling threatened, but I’m feeling pretty good. Maelyn is magic. #VoicePremiere

Thank you, @KeishaBottoms, for your efforts in Atlanta to reduce incarceration, and for informing me about this community-driven process to #closethejailatl. We encourage you to include the formerly incarcerated in deciding what the space becomes next! https://t.co/N1ckooztZr

@awkwafina It took me a while to figure out the spelling. I never processed the first w.  And I refused to Google it
@MarkObbie @NYTmag "...Remedies for mass incarceration shouldn’t be considered crazy. It should be considered crazy that we have mass incarceration in the first place."
@MarkObbie @NYTmag I agree with that, basically.  "I don’t believe that what I think is radical. We’re the most incarcerated country in the world. That should be considered radical. Police are allowed to shoot unarmed black men in the street. That’s radical..."
It was an honor to share the stage at #MBKRising with Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin; Reverend Wanda Johnson, mother of Oscar Grant, and Congresswoman Lucy McBath, mother of Jordan Davis.  Thank you for your powerful, inspiring stories. https://t.co/1AJDOPcD1i

@showstopper816 definitely not Trump's fault.  This problem predates his political career, by far.  Citizens United decision by the John Roberts court made it worse (during Obama administration, but Obama opposed the decision).

@Jdruc00 I think they will win more votes and small dollar donations if they make it clear that they can't be bought by big corporations, etc
@tjhansen Make the case to the American people and rely on smaller donations
@tjhansen That's great. But this bill won't pass the GOP Senate and Trump wont sign. How about Dems unilaterally vow to voluntarily follow a certain anti-corruption code even if it's not the law of the land.
@jDorai Both parties should. You're right. But the Democrats claim to be the party of the people. GOP makes it clear their main goal is lowering taxes for the rich and deregulating corporations.  Democrats should back up their brand with actions that make it clear who they stand with
Democrats should make it their policy to truly drain the swamp. Show that you can't be bought.  Show that you are making policy with no ulterior motives.  Make that a core part of the brand
Everybody's retweeting this. But it really is great. This is what the People's House needs. https://t.co/pmqenfaybh

@tariqnasheed No one asked me to be in a Harvey doc. I'm friends with the #SurvivingRKelly director and several protestors in the #MuteRKelly movement so I had a personal connection and agreed to appear. I don't just go around interviewing for every exposé. This is dumb
@tariqnasheed I'm glad you agree with me that R deserves the Weinstein treatment. Believe the victims, expose the rampant predatory behavior, career destruction and indictment with convictions hopefully in the future.
@DreMicheals1 Weinstein has been exposed. His career is destroyed, he's ostracized from the business  and will never make a movie again.  He's charged with sexual assault and is awaiting trial. If you want the same for R, then great!  Me too.
@BluBell17 We have never collabed. Ever.
@BluBell17 Please show me the songs I made with him. Google really hard. They don't exist.
If y'all wanna cape for R and discount all these women's stories, just say it. Don't bring up some old pics of me and somebody else. https://t.co/2wus2P7vNm
I took a photo with and worked with Harvey on several occasions before his abuse was known to me and the rest of the world.  Since his being exposed, his company and career have rightfully been destroyed and he's been indicted. Sounds like something that should happen to R Kelly https://t.co/LgIOQpEnsP
@dh_simba7 @JT_theQB4th Congratulations on a phenomenal season!  On to the next challenge!
@mason_patty Love you back!  Just believe that pundits' opinions should represent a wider range of the diversity of the populace. And likability depends on perspective and we should be getting a range of perspectives
"Dada's shoulders" https://t.co/SKbs9JcuWM
And this goes to who has the authority to write about likability in our major publications and opine on tv. Disporportionately it's a white dude. https://t.co/LlLaUjNJG2
@danpfeiffer *fails
@danpfeiffer I agree with the writer that all candidates are judged on their likability. But I think he falls to acknowledge that women have much less room to maneuver in that likability matrix. They can't be too tough or too joyous or too anything and it turns out there's nearly nothing left
@voguemagazine One small correction: that was a Google pixel 3. Hence the photo that captured the full brilliance and beauty of my wife and her outfit.

In @NYGovCuomo’s speech on 12/17, he restated commitment made at @GlblCtzn to #EndMoneyBail in 2019. But we know it will take this &amp; more to end mass jailing in NY. I support the bail demands delivered to Cuomo by 135+ groups: https://t.co/h4XtAbao1a #FREEnewyork

Also I'm happy to support the work of people like my friends at @ALongWalkHome who have been speaking out on behalf of the survivors for a long time.
To everyone telling me how courageous I am for appearing in the doc, it didn't feel risky at all. I believe these women and don't give a fuck about protecting a serial child rapist. Easy decision.
We should all thank my friend @dreamhampton for her very necessary work to create #SurvivingRKelly.  These survivors deserved to be lifted up and heard. I hope it gets them closer to some kind of justice.

@jaywillis @GQMagazine haha thanks!  Great article!
@chrissyteigen @GQMagazine the people will decide!!
@GQMagazine Unfortunately, it is political, in that it affects our politics and can manifest itself in government decisions.  But I agree with the article that it shouldn't be treated as an equal side in a respectable political debate.
@mattsnavely @eromiclord @mmfa @NateSilver538 I literally said none of that.  I didn't equate speech with terrorism and I didn't propose any government action.  I spoke about consumers' and advertisers' choices in response to speech.
I love you, Seattle!  We had so much fun tonight!  Thank you!!  #ALegendaryChristmas https://t.co/Vq21L3ZZpP
@Nole4life02 @NateSilver538 Yup. We good. Thanks
@NateSilver538 People of good conscience are right to alert the public about it and we can make our purchasing decisions accordingly
@NateSilver538 Far right extremism is the biggest terrorist threat in America. It is, in part, fueled by the rhetoric of demagogues who scare people about brown people and Jews. Some of those demagogues are on prime time on Fox News, getting ad dollars from mainstream corps
@NateSilver538 The logical endpoint of anything moderate could be something extreme. A silly reason to not do that moderate thing.
@NateSilver538 Slippery slope arguments are too easy. Executives can make decisions about what kind of speech goes too far and shouldn't be supported by ad dollars. I would submit that white supremacists should not receive corporate ad dollars

@prisonculture Exactly. Our kids don't get to be kids
Our show was pretty gif-tastic.  The gif that keeps on giving?  I quit. #ALegendaryChristmas https://t.co/hP1qq1wXxU
It's Chrissy's birthday!  I love you, my Queen! https://t.co/ihMpExGybC
The holidays can be difficult for both children &amp; parents who cannot be with their loved ones. @buildabear has donated bears to @girlscouts Beyond Bars, @still_she_rises, @AllofUsorNone, and the @WACorrections Center for Women to bring joy to families impacted by incarceration. https://t.co/9sEtIUIXLh
@NBCTheVoice No way!  John Legend can never be a coach on the Voice!  I will boycott!
I went ahead and recorded songs for all the holidays. https://t.co/gq1ZFUWmtP

"It Don't Have to Change" appeared on my album #GetLifted and really does feature the entire Stephens family - so happy they were able to fly in and sing with me again. #ALegendaryChristmas
Is this @ArthurPBS joke old yet? #ALegendaryChristmas
This was rigged. #smacdown #ALegendaryChristmas
Asking @NealBrennan for his opinion was just a courtesy, I know mine's better. #smacdown #ALegendaryChristmas
@Joey2196 @EspeSpalding It's called an homage my friend
#BringMeLove is one of my favorite songs off my album and I co-wrote it with my friend @Meghan_Trainor. #ALegendaryChristmas

Fun fact: I wasn't supposed to eat this. but I ate it. EVERY. SINGLE. TAKE. #ALegendaryChristmas
Don't worry @officialkenan, Luna only hangs up on people she loves. #ALegendaryChristmas
Mine's better. #smacdown #ALegendaryChristmas
Also, I really do have a @soundcloud with my album on it. https://t.co/j9JRmyxKOH #ALegendaryChristmas
Thanks to everyone who let us celebrate Christmas in October to make this happen! They truly didn't know we were coming. But they were prepped that they would be filmed and it was Christmas-related. #ALegendaryChristmas
Thanks to my friend and mentor @StevieWonder for playing the harmonica and being on #ALegendaryChristmas the TV special and my new album! Fun Fact:  Stevie always writes his own blind jokes.

@girlapproved_US They are not mobs.  They're asylum seekers traveling together. The president calls them mobs to dehumanize them so it's easier to harm them when the time comes.  The administration continues to act with hate and malice towards these people.
We had so much fun in Boston tonight!  A beautiful night at a beautiful venue.  Thank you!!! #ALegendaryChristmas https://t.co/5T8cTcBisM
@chrissyteigen @POPSUGAR My favorite!  You posted this to punish me for being on the road, didn't you.
@CathyItaliano Yes. He's evil. Period

@chrissyteigen @stuholden @KaralynWest @ClemsonTigers @OhioStateFB Yes we do!
@lcrx5 Every singer there was promoting something, my friend. That's exactly why we do tv performances.
@cmschiavone Same age as Luna!  She loves dancing to it too!
@MeetThePress @mmurraypolitics Why would you tweet this when it's obviously false?
It's "It Don't Have to Change" from Get Lifted. We're gonna sing it on #ALegendaryChristmas With John &amp; Chrissy on NBC Wednesday at 10pm!  I flew the whole family in from Ohio! https://t.co/cecixT94oL

@NinasCherry You will never find it because I never have
@lp_bruce Indeed they did.
We play most of the new Christmas album plus plenty of non-Christmas songs from my catalog. All of Me just might be one of them. (it is) https://t.co/b47VK2eIPe
@lp_bruce Fun suggestion: relax
Sometimes I'll really like a song but it doesn't fit with any of the other songs on the album. Maybe one day I'll just put those random ones out. https://t.co/pO3R29W0tK
@Busiswa Richard Bona, Angelique Kidjo
I've written in Nashville a bit. You could say it was country, but country and soul are pretty similar songwriting styles, just presented differently.  And I've written with and for rappers, of course https://t.co/tE05FEdfST
I don't throw anything away. But I imagine some of them will never be finished or released. I always write too many songs for every album so I can only use my favorites. https://t.co/JYdJ5c4rIN

@ingridmusic Happy Happy Christmas is my favorite so far. So good
@zenith5478 Happy holidays!  You seem to be in a bad mood. I hope things improve!
@EndP8riarchy Yep!  She kept sneaking bites before we served it!
@ingridmusic Thank you, Ingrid!! About to jam to yours on my flight back east!
@DCclone To replace the skim
My recipe is on Martha Stewart's site.  https://t.co/CHkeN0JWYp. but double the seasoning and use whole milk. They made it healthier than I do.
My only job for Thanksgiving dinner was this Mac &amp; cheese.  I won't say how good it was (it was dope tho) but it disappeared fast. https://t.co/MLZ0BPwAJD
@macantone @chrissyteigen Happy Thanksgiving Mario! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
@jmc598 @chrissyteigen That looks exquisite!
@caseypatterson Because I was robbed of the title on a certain television program!
@KamalaHarris Happy Thanksgiving, Senator!!
@eveewing @AnikaNoniRose Happy Thanksgiving!!
I had no idea the OSU band was there but I was waving at all the buckeye fans in the crowd.  Honestly I was wondering why so many were in NYC but now it all makes sense. https://t.co/ETbKEQP55D
Seriously. It's like they were holding on to that screenshot, plotting the shade for 4 years. https://t.co/aFjQ3J0LKX
I sang exactly as I would've if you could hear me. I figure that's the only way to believably do it. But I'm not an expert in these matters. https://t.co/jBj37kOPwj
True, but... I actually convinced Soul Train to let me sing live when I was on there back in the Get Lifted days. https://t.co/eCbuEQ0cwL
@chrissyteigen Savage. Respect the social media team at @Macys
Hahahahaha perfect https://t.co/PhmCaiAFxE
Fun fact. We all have to lip sync on this parade because the floats don't have the capacity to handle the sound requirements for a live performance. Hope y'all enjoyed it anyway. Know that if you come to my shows, the vocals are 100% live! https://t.co/C2bGj63AF6
Happy Thanksgiving! I’m on the @buildabear float at the #MacysParade and very soon I’ll be performing #MerryLittleChristmas from my new album #ALegendaryChristmas - tune in now on @nbc! https://t.co/nsihSSA58T
I pre-taped my Rockefeller Tree Lighting performance last night on a frigid rooftop. This #ALegendaryChristmas marketing plan looked a lot better on paper https://t.co/TXj3Geo7q8
Of course I chose the coldest day in Macy's Thanksgiving Parade history for my first ever performance there!
@DawneDeverell looks delicious!  Happy Thanksgiving!

If you're curious why this guy was picked for Acting AG.  Oh, and POTUS picked a Supreme Ct Justice who thinks Presidents are above the law. https://t.co/NqUtTjBSbg
The president is a fucking embarrassment.
@freewimin Listen to the podcast because things actually changed with Obama when it came to racial attitudes influencing party affiliation.
Definitely worth your time if you want to understand what's driving political trends since Obama was elected. https://t.co/Py67lgnC5m
@ericripert @LeBernardinNY @MichelinGuideNY Amazing!  Congratulations!
Flipping the house despite all the gerrymandering was no small feat.  Despite it being expected by the polls, this is still a BFD. The House has so much power to hold the president accountable. I look forward to some real oversight
People worked so hard around the country. Many voted who had never voted in the midterms. That was due to organizing and tenacity.  I'm grateful for everyone's sacrifice.
Excited about this too!  Thanks to all who organized and fought for this in Louisiana https://t.co/nKgk2fUXLx
This wasn't a red vs blue question. It was about doing the right thing by allowing people who've paid their debt to society to participate in the elections that affect them and everyone else.
I spent some time in Florida campaigning for this amendment. I was inspired by the grass roots efforts and the beautiful bipartisan coalition that worked for its passage. I'm so happy this amendment passed.
This is wonderful news and will affect Florida and national elections in perpetuity https://t.co/E3d2mTekA9

Ohio, did you know that EVERY SINGLE state House seat (99 total!) is up for election this year? These positions are crucial for redistricting. Let’s show up for the Democratic candidates running for the OH House! https://t.co/jImG6u6vJQ
Great to be back in my home state of Ohio supporting amazing Democrats running for office this year. If you live in Ohio, be sure to vote @SherrodBrown for Senate, @RichCordray for Gov, yes on Issue 1 and Dem up and down the ticket!

Don't "some critics say" or "both sides" this story. Everyone knows what's happening and why.

@Henrygda The bipartisan support in Congress was veto-proof, but continue
@ramen_girl__ I didn't watch the sideshow today. Not interested
@GlennGardner8 The industry groups just had to get together and reconcile their differences. The streaming era means we had to modernize the rules that were written for a different time w/ different technology. Their unity and hard work took time to come together.  POTUS had next to no impact
I'm happy Trump signed this necessary bill. I'm grateful to all those who worked to write and pass it. The Recording Academy and other industry groups worked very hard. Secured bipartisan congressional support and got it through both houses. Trump signed his name. https://t.co/DfXQJzrBy4

@secupp He doesn't have a right to be one of 9 on the supreme Court. That is a position of high honor and extreme privilege. He has the right to not be criminally convicted and locked up without convincing evidence. It's a different standard.
@Yi_Dav2016 @secupp Well, you could understand him lying about, say, sexually assualting someone. But lying about getting very drunk is ridiculous and unnecessary.  All these beers and underage drinking and you never went too far?  Obvious bullshit.
@mikedaitch @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp My belief that the government shouldn't have power over a woman's uterus is very much a moral issue. My belief that a supreme Court Justice shouldn't be a liar and sexual assualter: also moral
@TallManShort @US395 @secupp Dr Ford is not absurd and her accusations clearly weren't. Did you watch her testimony?
@liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp These are the sorts of details the FBI investigates to help flesh out the facts and assess the credibility of the accusations.  GOP doesn't want the investigation because they're afraid of the truth.
@liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford came forward before Kavanaugh was even picked, when he was on a short list. That timeline is critical. It shows the party wasn't paying or inciting her to come forward. She knew he had integrity issues and didn't want him to be picked from the shortlist.
@MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp The rape question goes to his credibility, integrity, temperament. It's not a criminal case. There is no beyond a reasonable doubt standard.
@MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp It is not a criminal prosecution of a rape claim. This is not a rape case. It's a job interview to decide whether or not Kavanaugh should get a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. A position that gives him power over all of our lives
@US395 @secupp Trump promised he would pick judges that would overturn RvW. He said women should be punished.  And the federalist society is committed to overturning as well.  So are we supposed to believe that Kavanaugh was picked and won't carry out their plan?
@liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp We dont know the extent of the evidence because the claims haven't been investigated. They should be investigated
@DestructiveChem @secupp Real, actual, sentient human beings have said they were victims of Kavanaugh and his cronies. The Democratic party didn't make this up. If you want to call the women liars, just say it.
@DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford accused him with clarity and credibility. The Democratic party didn't.
@DestructiveChem @secupp Are you calling Dr Ford a liar?  Did she make all of this up?
@JustMaintain @secupp It's about all of it
@secupp And the fact that this person who made all of these "boys will be boys" mistakes as a teenager can now have the power to force a teenage girl to carry a pregnancy to term is downright terrifying.
@secupp I hate his politics. But I'm also resigned to the fact that a conservative without integrity issues will make it to the court, just like Gorsuch did. Kavanaugh is a terrible choice even among conservatives I clearly disagree with
@secupp And I don't think we've ever seen a court nominee display such disdain for the other political party. He obviously can't be even remotely impartial.
@secupp He lied about his involvement in Bush policy decisions and judge nomination campaigns. He most likely lied about the extent of his drinking and other things he could have admitted to. He's not to be trusted.
@secupp The biggest problem with him is that he's lied multiple times before the senate, sometimes about things he needn't lie about.
@JasonBrandon8 So we pick based on who's most qualified now? What does that even mean really
Raise your hand if you believe there's even a tiny chance Kavanaugh has never had so much to drink that he didn't remember some of the night's events.  He's obviously a liar.
People keep saying it's not in the Constitution. That's why we have amendments.  The Constitution can change.  The founding fathers weren't divine.
@raythemaverick I'm saying the Constitution is wrong on this point. I know what it says. I know that it's completely ridiculous in the real world too
@Aftermath8 The founding fathers aren't divine. They fucked up on this one, among other things
And obviously the senate needs to be dramatically changed.  California's representation vs Wyoming is a travesty
I haven't workshopped this but it ain't crazy. It's like best actor and best actress categories.
We should have a man and a woman representing each district and state to guarantee 50/50 representation.
I believe Dr Ford. Thank you for your courage
Who coached him to sound like a complete asshole?

@Pixielele As soon as we pick a name!
I recently realized my bio is a lie. I have two relatives named Arthur. Both chose to be called by their middle names, but their first names were indeed Arthur. I apologize to all those I've hurt.  I'm still not related to THAT Arthur
@BrooklynDecker We were watching it in the labor and delivery room haha. Too funny and too real.
A whole lot of Americans' ancestors brutally enslaved, beat, lynched and raped my ancestors. A lot of the same folks quick to call other folks animals.  What does that make you?  The answer is that we're all human. And some humans do really fucked up things. https://t.co/XBiyHNhUQR
@elliottpatsy1 Some are education related charities, some that deal with criminal justice reform, some that deal with feeding the poor.
@OluwaSirdam When did I support evil?  If we want to prevent evil we need to at least confront the realities that led to it. People don't commit crimes because liberals are too soft to call them animals.
@OluwaSirdam We are the product of a bunch of decisions, including plenty of our own.  But we all have parents, neighborhoods, governments, etc. whose decisions help shape our future too.
@Beard__Chase no, I'm saying some innocent children grow up to be gang members.  do you dispute this obvious fact?
@KentBrockman13 nope.  but they're human. nazis were humans.  kkk members human.  the people who do the absolute worst things are still human.  calling them animals may make us feel better.  doesn't make it true.
Dehumanizing large groups of people is the demagogue's precursor to visiting violence and pain upon them. It makes it easier to destroy their families and much worse.
And we should particularly interrogate the role of American policy in helping to make MS-13 the organization it is now.
But it's much more honest and challenging to realize they were all babies once and think about what in society, their home life, etc took them from baby to violent gang member. And then to think about collective action we could take to mitigate these conditions
Even human beings who commit heinous acts are the same species as us, not "animals". I'm in the hospital with our new son. Any of these babies here could end up committing terrible crimes in the future. It's easy, once they've done so, to distance ourselves from their humanity

@JessieJaneDuff @lionsmds @theglobaluniter @NRA @kanyewest @chrissyteigen Thank you!
You can show me all the individuals you want. I'm sure they are wonderful people. The NRA's agenda is to sell more guns and stop any meaningful gun safety measures. You are a danger to America. You are a danger to law enforcement. https://t.co/yIAbotNU8i

We discussed the infamous text exchange, why policy matters, why black people tend to vote for Democrats, the history behind our party loyalty (hint:  we ain't slaves), and how we can remember our history and still be fly.
Had an excellent conversation with my brother @ebrointheAM!  Listen to all of it here!  https://t.co/WxCZ5bGEBm
@BernardKerik @majority4_trump @NRA Police in nations without our addiction to guns almost never have to worry about being shot. And they rarely resort to shooting civilians. The NRA's only mission is to sell more guns. They are dangerous to police.

Just like Trump to slap his name on something someone else built and take credit for it.
I know fact free thought is a major pillar of maga but here's a little chart showing how black unemployment went down dramatically under Obama (after Dubya's financial meltdown) and has continued going down a little under Trump. So we do thank our President Obama for this! https://t.co/Nl0ySJkUt4
Based on the flood of maga in my mentions, they think Trump saved America's economy. And that black folks, in particular, should be grateful to our racist president for our low unemployment rate

Anyway, y'all need to come to Montgomery and see this memorial
The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy.  He made it clear every time he spoke. Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with &gt;1% of anyone's thoughts though
I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth.
They see the statistics about black applications for real estate or loans or employment being turned away because their name was Jamal and not James
They know their family was destroyed by deportation or incarceration. They know their loved one was denied safe harbor because of their religion. They know their son or daughter was shot because their skin color evoked fear
Far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist.
I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences. However...

@Brandenbee @BarackObama The assault weapons ban lapsed under GW Bush
I’d probably assume he/she would become President. They’ve seen their current President do much worse on a debate stage. Including bragging about his dick size. https://t.co/q2EnCA6wYo
#JesusChristSuperstar 4/1/18 @nbc https://t.co/FIDc0ggs1D
Data on the effect of the assault weapons ban. The ban is designed to prevent massacres, not gun violence writ large. It’s only a small portion of the solution to our gun violence problem. But it’s an important step toward ending the American epidemic of mass shooting https://t.co/2ced5P2Vrm
@jimmy_molestina Did you hear of the armed stewardesses force?  No.  That would be the proper analogy to teachers being armed.
Arms dealers love arms races.
You’ll note that all NRA-sponsored politicians suggest gun violence solutions that involve more guns being bought and sold. I wonder why that is 🤔
@jennsue8277 A disturbed shooter doesn’t care if the school is private or public. AR-15 bullets don’t discriminate between rich and poor.
The fact this is up for discussion is totally absurd. But this is a good thread to hopefully obliterate the COMPLETELY LUDICROUS idea that arming teachers is the solution to school shootings. https://t.co/yf4jHfpCOR
We don’t pay our teachers enough to TEACH. Now these fools want them to double as armed security.  Meanwhile our kids are the active shooter drill generation.

@secupp Like i said, lax state gun laws correlate with higher gun deaths.  This is not refutable.
@secupp Please see this chart. Most deaths by firearm per capita, all red states with lax gun laws. Illinois not even near the top 10. https://t.co/0onKlCyPOI.
@DannyBritton256 Chicago is not a state.
@secupp Chicago is a stone’s throw from Indiana. DC from Virginia. Surely you know this.
@SethMacFarlane Annnnd deaths by car have gone down significantly since we started better regulation of auto safety. Seems like better regulation might be a remedy for gun deaths too
@secupp @RonaldKlain And our rate of gun massacres like this is beyond incomparable.
@secupp @RonaldKlain Gun deaths are also more prevalent in states with lax gun laws. And America is by far the most gun owning major country and our deaths by gun reflect that, regardless of the decline since the 90s (which corresponds with overall decline in crime)
@HardballChris People of high character and ability don’t want to work for someone like him. He’s disloyal, dishonest, corrupt, racist, misogynist, has no intellectual curiosity and can’t focus. Terrible boss.
@youngsinick Jeff Secessionist has to be one of your better nicknames. I will never call him Sessions again.
The Obamas so cool and graceful. Their successor defending spousal abusers. So stark.
@deray I co-write songs on it. It’s perfect for that.

@CillizzaCNN You too!
@CillizzaCNN I agree that your piece does not make Trump and Weinstein equal.  The one tweet you wrote implied that and I was responding to that tweet
@CillizzaCNN Donors and bundlers are replaceable, and the Democratic Party doesn't need a disgraced movie exec to raise money.
@CillizzaCNN This is true, but in no way mirrors the fact that GOP nominated an admitted sexual abuser to be POTUS.
@CillizzaCNN Furthermore, which prominent liberals are defending Weinstein, nominating him for POTUS, etc.?  Come on.
@CillizzaCNN My point is that putting them on the same plane is ridiculous. If Trump were just a reality show host and exec producer, then it makes sense
@CillizzaCNN Holding a movie exec and the leader of the free world to the same standard is ludicrous.
@CillizzaCNN Sure, we should condemn him.  And neither of them should be President of the United States.

Trump is only consistently loyal to white supremacists and Putin
Trump is the opposite of a patriot
The White House is again urging the firing of people who exercise free speech to fight for equality and justice. Shameful.
We have to show him that we can bring a multiracial coalition together for justice and equality for all.  Let's unite around that.
Trump thrives on division and chaos.  He wants to pit us against each other because he thinks his side can win (w/voter suppression, etc.)
Perhaps it's not a great honor while your stench is there. https://t.co/sgX8Mv54DS

Trump calls them rapists and murderers. Sessions calls them aliens. It's all meant to justify violent, racist policies that destroy families
Dehumanizing language has been used to justify and soften all sorts of bigotry. To minimize cognitive dissonance. Don't be fooled.
Quit calling human beings "illegal aliens".  They're people.  They're our friends, neighbors and co-workers.  They're dreamers &amp; lovers
Thank you, President Obama https://t.co/r3c5NMpQG4
@Sashamae14 @luv2Bmyvette That's a lie.
@carynjenks Did you read my tweets? That casting call was not for my video and didn't come from my production team
Oh, and both sides of the political spectrum have their share of Americans of all shapes and sizes!
I am shooting a video tomorrow w/ a political scene in it but that casting notice wasn't from our production at all. More on my video soon!
I still think Trump is awful and whoever voted for him did a disservice to the country. But I didn't issue this casting call.
There's a casting call out there claiming to represent me looking for "out of shape" Trump supporters. This didn't come from me or my team

@MattCappel @swoolvers @Dlc40458 He tried to destroy America.  As did Robert E Lee.  He was responsible for a few thousand deaths.  Lee a lot more. Both villains.
The Confederacy was the villain.  Get their statues out of our parks.  They deserve no honor or reverence.
Preserving history doesn't require us glorifying the villain.
Think of how absurd and repugnant it would be to erect a memorial to Bin Laden in the middle of Ground Zero to "preserve history"
Modern-day Germans could teach us a lot about remembering and denouncing our shameful past.
Robert E Lee tried to destroy this country to preserve slavery.  He doesn't deserve a statue anywhere.

It's still hard for me to believe so many people voted for this idiot. This is your fault too.

@fleeroff Sure. But the press has a responsibility to modify these "populists" appropriately if their populism is defined by racism/xenophobia
Populists should represent the interests of ordinary people. If people are excluded because of their race or religion, it's not populism
I would like the media to stop using "populist" as a synonym or euphemism for white nationalist or racist. They're not the same thing.

@PassionatelyPam Obamacare not perfect. Trumpcare is dramatically worse.
@mckaycoppins The policy is gonna be felt deeply in their districts if it passes. If not, will at least make for some tough ads
@mckaycoppins The process is the least of their worries.

@jbarro Sort of. But advance could easily be inflated and he won't have to pay it back

The bag was taken because it was left unattended. The airport police caught the person who took it (on video) and retrieved my bag.

@Sonialand @PureManhattan I agree that we should make health care more affordable for more people in the middle class. Trump does opposite
@Sonialand @PureManhattan the out of state options aren't in this bill. Will supposedly be in "phase 3" assuming this phase is passed
@matslav I know, man.  I really wish people understood how taxes and government are supposed to work.  The concept is so simple, really.
myth = lie in this case. https://t.co/kZkpA9vi26
@Ann53165262 I agree that's not affordable for a lot of Americans. The answer is to make it more so. Trumpcare does the opposite.
Hmm. What they don't have in common with healthcare:  You need healthcare to survive https://t.co/oIvzuialR0
Exactly. We all have "access" to private jumbo jets and 5th ave penthouses. https://t.co/HiD280wbZ4
@PureManhattan so let's improve ACA to extend coverage. Trumpcare does the exact opposite.
@Heymynameisbenn exactly
@PureManhattan these are not opinions. Bill phases out Medicaid extension and cuts taxes for rich people whose taxes were raised for ACA
If only there was an organization that pooled all our tax money and redistributed it to help cover those in need. Someone should invent this https://t.co/U0zwRuIeTu
Trumpcare gives billions in taxes back to people like me. Takes healthcare from millions of ordinary Americans. This is terrible.
That's what taxes are for. Trump/Ryan plan lowers my taxes so they can take health care from poor/working class. https://t.co/tJQ15uDjIb
Yes, Democrats shld explain what we need to do to cover even more people at more affordable prices (what Trump promised in the campaign btw) https://t.co/kxUuS3a5bt

@rolandsmartin @SHO_Homeland so wild. Excellent episode
@Pudnite when have you seen me critique his appearance?
@PhilArzola he specifically said they were failing and losing subscribers.  But the opposite is true.
My hacker's assessment of my endowment was confusing.  Big in the tweet about Hillary.  Small in the bio.  Make up your mind, hacker.
I did call him Liar-In-Chief.  Then my hacker took over to do the Angrier John version of it all.
I wouldn't call him a Cheeto because I enjoy Cheetos.
I would never threaten violence to the President.  No matter how much I wish he would go away.
I'm back.  My hacker was vulgar and kinda hilarious.  I'll try to be funnier from now on so he won't feel the need to ghost write for me.
Someone just hacked my account.
Quick fact check on the Liar-In-Chief:  These particular news outlets are doing extremely well right now. https://t.co/uZW2TFyCw5

@JoshEOliver @yashar @ScottFeinberg oh, we're united. He's done a great job of galvanizing his opposition.
@K2rd @mlcalderone @POLITICOMag you tell them that the shooter wouldn't have been covered by this ban.
@K2rd @mlcalderone @POLITICOMag Don't know, but if it was a lot, that means the vetting system in place already was effective. No ban needed

@dbuns12 our new president is doing some egregious things. A lot of people are rightfully worried and we're talking about it.
@dbuns12 without twitter, you can pretty much ignore my politics and focus on what you enjoy about my music

@FairConsistent @thenewjimcrow absolutely!  Great book!
@Trauberstar it had been reauthorized almost unanimously for years. Then Obama won...
@Trauberstar @POTUS44 and I promise you GOP wouldn't write these laws if affected their voters more
@Trauberstar @POTUS44 most Americans of all colors have the right ID. The laws just affect the margins which only matter in closer elections
@Trauberstar @POTUS44 yes, it was
@Trauberstar and we need to reinstate all of the Voting Rights Act so that the fed gov can check states for discrimination
@Trauberstar both parties should commit to making it convenient to register and vote. And they should maximize the franchise as much as poss
@Trauberstar again, they don't necessarily hate young people, but they're more likely to win if college students don't vote
@Trauberstar they also try to limit student voting whenever they can. Also, because they vote Dem.
@Trauberstar it's not because they necessarily hate minorities. It's because they know they vote Dem and want less Dem votes.
@Trauberstar minorities are more likely to not have the required ID. GOP lawmakers know this and use it to lower Dem turnout
@Trauberstar that is immoral. I'm taking your word for it because I don't know about that example
@Trauberstar of course there are felons of all colors. But lawmakers knew it would hurt POC more and that was a reason for doing it.
@Trauberstar yes and has always been aimed at black voters. When they were originally written, the legislators said that.
@Trauberstar both are self-serving but one is most definitely less righteous.
@Trauberstar dems want to maximize the the legal vote. GOP, the opposite. Not morally equivalent, in my opinion.
@Trauberstar @POTUS he's either delusional or intentionally lying. And he undermines credibility in our democracy
@Trauberstar @POTUS it's not like it's even plausible. He just needs to say and/or believe it to feel legitimate and demonize "illegals"
@Trauberstar formerly incarcerated deserve the right to vote after they've paid their debt to society. They have to pay taxes. Shld vote too
@OCSBRom are you aware of the history of America?  pretty much everything in America was anti-black until recently
@Trauberstar again, he does it for personal gain (possibly millions of $). What gain from voting illegally?
@Trauberstar millions of illegal voters is an outright lie. Myth is probably to gentle of a term
@Trauberstar for it to swing an election, it would have to be organized by large groups of voters.
@Trauberstar but what would you gain from taking the risk of getting caught. 1 vote?  I guess you could do it for fun and to tell the story
@Trauberstar ID laws sounds so innocent, but those laws are targeted toward poor POC likely to vote for Dems. The lawmakers are well aware
@Trauberstar and the Brennan center article gives the numbers for % chance of voter impersonation. Extremely low. Minuscule. Near 0
@Trauberstar please google the NC case. It's exemplary of other cases nationwide
@Trauberstar it is literally a lie intended to target potential democratic voters, particularly black and brown ones. It is pretty clear
@Trauberstar it is indeed. Courts in NC actually said the legislature made a "surgical" effort to identify ways to suppress black votes.
@Trauberstar we all know why it's even discussed. Only to justify suppression and, in DJT's case, to make him feel better about pop vote
@Trauberstar if by nuance you mean 0.000007 % or something, yes I agree
@tomrogers1995 Read it again.
@Trauberstar criminals usually think they'll gain something from their crime. What's the incentive to vote 2x?  Or vote once illegally?
@ginaderosa exactly. Just another excuse for Trump to demonize brown people
Voting LEGALLY is inconvenient and worth only one vote among millions. Why would anyone go through that AND risk jail. Voter fraud is a myth

@cjnkira @brianrayguitar @StevenSinger3 I'm on the board of a public charter school. I receive no compensation from the school
@cjnkira @brianrayguitar @StevenSinger3 I most definitely don't support her and I don't make money off of any schools at all.
@no_i_natale @thehill exactly. Obama is a brilliant writer but also used speech writers. No need to lie about it. It's all good!
@davidaxelrod yes, and he continues to make it clear he will lie about ANYTHING, big or small, even when photos are there for all to see.
@politico you guys should practice saying "he lied" in the mirror. I have a feeling this will come in very handy
if you're offended by the last retweet, I hope you didn't vote for the guy who talked about his dick size on the GOP debate stage.

@MikeSingap happy anniversary!
@virginiadf36 please tell me what I've said or done that was bigoted.
@TheJudahMethod I'm fine with that. All I care about is people getting the coverage they need.
@Lyannaaa128 you clearly didn't read my tweets about wanting the country to succeed
@Lyannaaa128 so I assume you were always rooting for Obama?
He railed against Goldman Sachs, now his administration has its own Goldman alumni chapter.
He already took the time to make middle class's mortgage more expensive today. He made sure he got to that before he took the weekend off
Trump is most definitely gonna lower my taxes. That's a guarantee. What's he gonna do for the working class/poor?  That's the question.
@kwilk75 wait til you see this mythical "replacement".
@chrissyteigen @lydiabasiorka well alright now https://t.co/adVD7aoUAv
I've done the exact opposite of wasting my talent. https://t.co/vKynYCtUFG
@lydiabasiorka he's definitely gonna lower my taxes. What is he going to do for the working class?
@lydiabasiorka now let's see if he actually does anything to help the working class. One of his first acts made your mortgage more expensive
@daniellan192 @JKacherski96 he hates on Mexicans, muslims, disabled people, former POWs. He is the most terrific hater in politics
@daniellan192 @JKacherski96 Trump is the hater in chief. He spent most of Obama's term harassing him over this fake birther story.
@MeshellShannon I wish we didn't just elect a racist president.
@lydiabasiorka I didn't lose anything. What did you win?
@Sandrahammond20 exactly why I said I want him and the country to succeed
@JKacherski96 @daniellan192 if he's awesome at being president, he will be popular and supported. He won't have to worry about haters
@daniellan192 cooperate with what?
@lydiabasiorka I'll respect him like he respected Obama
@BmgForever then you just do whatever you get paid to do and stop tweeting me
@daniellan192 nope. He's in charge. It's on him to do the right thing.
Prove us "haters" wrong, Mr Trump
I believe Trump to be a lying narcissist bigot who is completely unfit to be president. For our country's sake, I'd love to be wrong.
If success means denying millions health care, building more walls and rolling back civil rights progress, I want him to fail miserably
I want America to succeed. Success means we're more prosperous, peaceful, and just. If that's Trump's definition of success, great.
@thisbloodsaves those polls correctly predicted that Hillary would win the popular vote by 2-3 points. State polls were off but not national
@chrissyteigen tenure, ten-year.  I get it!
@kreativ8 or he's just pretty unpopular. I think that's what it is.
@CMCNICK I hope the country succeeds under his tenure
@CMCNICK @realDonaldTrump I. Didn't. Lose. My taxes are about to go down.  Trump loves the 1%. Working class, not so much.
@MikeSingap I told you I would do it after my meeting.  Have a wonderful night
@LongLongo5 I didn't lose. America lost.  I pray that I'm wrong.
#ThankYouObamas!  Unemployment so low no one had time to go to the inauguration. https://t.co/s2SkErYK2f
@crusher04 it was freezing for both Obama inaugurations. Could it be that Trump has the lowest favorability of any modern incoming POTUS?
Sad! https://t.co/Rjf80dvqX8
@ShanCholak @realDonaldTrump if only it were a game. I'm very worried for our country. I hope he proves me wrong
@ConnorMcHurdle true. Unemployment is much lower since Obama took office. #ThankYouObamas
@ShanCholak @realDonaldTrump wishing for Trump to be graceful is like wishing for snow in Abu Dhabi
The last 2 inaugurations were very crowded. This one is so... roomy
#ThankYouObamas. I'm proud to know you. Proud to have supported you. Thank you for your wisdom, grace and service to your country.

@Dindoo_Nuffin odd you say that. Obama had absolutely no whiff of personal scandal. Trump admitted sexual assault and infidelity.

@Susancnw please send me the link
@Susancnw asking black lives matter movement to be condemn every crime committed by black people is ridiculous.
@Susancnw people protest police shootings because it is particularly bad when the state kills people and almost never faces justice
@Susancnw color doesn't matter but you're asking me to condemn it because the perpetrators were black and I am too?
@Susancnw of course it was despicable and I'm glad they were arrested and will face justice.
@genericmetsfan @Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine yep and I voted for Gore, Kerry and Hillary because they're black too
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine who said 5% was a tragedy for anyone?  10+% in 2009 is what we're recovering from
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine and they never are unless they begin looking for work. This isn't new under obama. It's always done this way
@austinhutchison @CoachJim4UM @Usher @UMichFootball I spoke to Coach Harbaugh yesterday. We bonded over him being from Ohio.
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine this article explains unemployment rate and labor participation rate. https://t.co/H6g3hX9QLj
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine but some of those who gave up are finally trying again because job market is improving.
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine some of reduced labor participation is aging baby boomers. Some is people who gave up
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine they're the same people that calculate labor participation which isn't as favorable to obama.
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine no one cooked the numbers.The independent non-partisan bureau calculates them the same way for every president
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine and Obama still had the most consecutive months of job growth (75 in a row) in decades
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine obama also tried to pass a big jobs/infrastructure bill to increase construction jobs but was denied by GOP
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine we have to make sure our workforce is prepared for the jobs of the future. They may not look like the past
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine and yes we need more jobs in the Midwest but we have to be prepared that jobs will change with technology
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine yes, that's why I was so pleased when Obama bailed out the auto industry several years ago, saving many jobs
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine my father was an auto worker in Ohio for 30 years. I haven't forgotten where I come from.
@skipgodfrey dec 2016 is 156K. 15M+ is 2010-2016 since the recovery began. Entire term counting bottom of crisis in 09 = 11M net jobs gained
@TomHiter @universeman13 @hugetinymistake no one has seen his taxes. This is not verifiable at all.
@PR1CCC It was terrible. I'm glad they got arrested and will hopefully pay for their crimes.
Thank you, President Obama https://t.co/tEoMKbLgr3
@TomHiter good luck moving to this tax free paradise you speak of.
@listentolee so let's ask the GOP to increase subsidies so that the middle class can have access too.
@coppervase I pay my fair share. Tell that to your tax-avoiding president-elect
@kortgable @Kokobunga8 agreed.So let's ask the GOP to expand the subsidy or somehow make good coverage cheaper. I fear they will do opposite
This is good. And there's a good point about where Obamacare doesn't work as well:  middle class people who make too much for subsidies https://t.co/KikmvctEQy
@kortgable @Kokobunga8 the alternative should not be to allow families to opt out because it's so expensive then die when they get sick
@kortgable @Kokobunga8 my fear is that reform will be to the left of Obamacare and untenable for GOP base
@kortgable @Kokobunga8 those who make too much for subsidy but still can't afford the coverage they need
@kortgable @Kokobunga8 I think we agree that the GOP standard for improving the system will be making it more affordable for mid class
@megan_roundtree it's up to us to pressure him to do the right thing. We should set the bar high for whatever he does to improve/replace ACA
Improvement should mean more coverage for more people at a more affordable price. I'm afraid GOP will go in opposite direction.
Obamacare was the free market conservative compromise modeled after Romneycare. It was bound to be imperfect. But millions were helped by it
To be clear, I wish US had truly universal health coverage, something to the left of Obamacare. But going backwards will literally kill ppl
@IanMcGimsey so let's improve it to make it even more affordable!
That's literally what I'm doing when I pay taxes. This is how redistribution works. I'm happy to do it for a good cause like health care https://t.co/ggfYZmlQqD
"Hollywood celebrities need to shut up!"  Oh ok. Who did you vote for?  "the reality show star. And Reagan was the greatest president ever!"

Tony, you're sounding downright deplorable. Why so angry? https://t.co/ebFK6PCMcK
@kortgable let's hope the GOP replacement makes it more affordable. I'm afraid it will go in the opposite direction.
Oh, silly Mike. Come see me when you have something substantive to say https://t.co/XMbnJa5nQ4
@sasmanic then the fixes to Obamacare should improve it to make it even more affordable. I'm afraid they will go in the opposite direction
@kortgable I encourage you to investigate the available plans. Most aren't nearly that expensive. And subsidies make it much cheaper
@CarltonFoster4 people don't buy Obamacare. It's just a regulated exchange for private insurance plans. I have insurance through my union.
@missmagen23 it's all messy. Obamacare is actually the "happy" medium. We either go to less coverage/more instability or universal coverage
@willjackrob subsidies/Medicaid cover those in poverty and middle class above poverty line (unless red state won't accept it)
@missmagen23 reinstating the pre-existing conditions restrictions and lifetime benefit limits would truly bankrupt you if you get sick
@natelaplume73 I'd prefer true universal care/single payer.  So I'd be happy for us to go left of Obamacare.
@Oli_W49 @chancetherapper we can do more than hope. Speak up when the replacement they offer is inadequate. More than likely it will be
Call me a Hollywood elitist, but I think it's unconscionable that the richest country in the world would go back to bankrupting the sick
@Oli_W49 I hope the GOP replacement is an improvement for you and the country. I sincerely doubt it though.
@AntiWestboro I wish you the best under the new regime. I hope the GOP will find a way to make sure you have more affordable care
@HAMbonian @LOLGOP trust me, if I'm being selfish, I don't need any government help and repeal would lower my taxes. This isn't for me
@Link0292 that would be too easy and sensible. America has to make the most convoluted work-around, of course
I sincerely hope working class Trump voters speak out about what it will mean for them to lose their coverage. Call your congressperson
Governing is not a game. It's all fun when you can pass 70 repeal bills that get vetoed. Now actual lives are at stake.
Obamacare replacement plan is currently delay, delay, delay and try to blame it on someone else when it all collapses https://t.co/e7cUqcp7gt

@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze how can both be true?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze you're certain that millions voted illegally. Also certain that there's no tangible proof
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze millions is a lot of people. Surely there is some proof that led you to this number
@Awake_Today @theblaze that hoax is terrible. But the truth of hate crimes spike is verified and very real.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze if you can't believe any govt stat, what's the point in discussing it?  Goodnight
@Awake_Today @theblaze examples?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze why wouldn't we be brilliant enough to cheat in the swing states?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze how do you know that it's millions if there's no paper trail?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze so you can just make unproven claims as though they are facts?  Why the certainty?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze thank god trump is here to save us!
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze look at all the data on GDP, unemployment, stock market, incomes. All improved since 2008
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze there are people suffering. Far fewer than 2008/09. Thank you to Obama
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze if Dems were so brilliant at cheating, why would we have wasted it on CA and not MI/PA/WI
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze ok. I need you to show me proof of these millions of illegal voters. I'll wait
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze do you not recall how bad things were in 2008?  so much better now.  Indisputable
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze incomes have gone up, GDP growth at 3+% recently. Where is this devastation he caused?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze the unemployment rate is calculated the same way under every president.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze haha. This is hilarious. Yet sad. What you're saying is just ridiculous and unproven
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze you have no proof. It's completely false and defies common sense
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze proof please.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze the devastation happened in 2008. Obama rescued us from it. The facts are clear
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze unemployment in 2009 over 10%. Now under 5%. Stock market grew. Auto industry saved
@Awake_Today @theblaze the rise in hate crimes is a fact. The false, hate-inciting statements he made are on the record. This isn't opinion
@Awake_Today @theblaze but when someone in leadership (the future POTUS) is spreading dangerous lies, it fuels hate and violence
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze especially in places like California where the outcome is already guaranteed to be blue
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze it's already an inconvenience to vote. Why would you wait in line and risk arrest?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze think about how stupid it would be for a person to vote illegally
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze they don't count. There is no proof that millions of illegal voters voted.
@Awake_Today @theblaze if you think thousands of muslims, were dancing on a rooftop on 9/11, I don't know what to tell you
@Awake_Today @theblaze if you're still holding on to the birther lie, there's no hope for you. Let it go, my friend. Let it go
@Awake_Today @theblaze are they though?  They've been subjected to a rise in hate crimes and suspicion because of his false statements
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze I'm not arguing whether or not he is the legal PEOTUS. I'm saying she won working class
@Awake_Today @theblaze Joe arpaio is a clown. Luckily the people of Arizona voted him out.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze minorities' votes still count. I'm sorry for the inconvenience
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze Hillary won the working class. If you exclude minorities, Trump won the working class
@Awake_Today @theblaze does it get tiring defending him?  You know what I'm saying is factual, right?
@Awake_Today @theblaze I respect that you're so committed to defending him that you'll keep going back and forth with me.
@Awake_Today @theblaze he literally said it would be a temporary ban on all muslims. How is that not a ban?
@Awake_Today @theblaze he's a lying, bigoted clown. Keep defending him though.
@Awake_Today @theblaze and claimed credit for forcing him to show his birth cert and never apologized for the whole ridiculous charade
@Awake_Today @theblaze refugees are always extensively vetted in America, by the way.
@Awake_Today @theblaze it's unconstitutional to ban entire religious group from America. Think if he said the same about Jews or Catholics
@Awake_Today @theblaze *birther
@Awake_Today @theblaze he disavowed Duke. He has never apologized for his own bigoted pronouncements. Not even the obvious birthed lie
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze she won among all people for that matter. But who cares about the popular vote, right?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze the fact is she won among people making 50k or less.  Check the data.
@Awake_Today @theblaze that's fine. Trump is the one proposing a Muslim ban. That's the definition of painting everyone with a broad brush
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze Hillary won the majority of those making under 50k. She won the working class.
@Awake_Today @theblaze he has never apologized for his own bigoted statements, the reasons why Duke supports him in the first place
@Awake_Today @theblaze it's literally made life more dangerous for my Muslim friends when lies like this are spread
@Awake_Today @theblaze he did it to question the loyalty of muslims. This subjects them to more suspicion and hate crimes
@Awake_Today @theblaze it is completely false. It was a bullshit rumor that a candidate for president shouldn't be saying.
@Awake_Today @theblaze he never renounced or apologized for his own bigoted statements. He had to be pressed to denounce Duke too.
@Awake_Today @theblaze if you support him despite these things, just say that. Don't deny they happened when they're on the record
@Awake_Today @theblaze has he apologized for his false statements about Mexican immigrants being esp prone to rape and murder? Of course not
@Awake_Today @theblaze are you saying that trump has renounced any of his racist/bigoted statements?  You know that's not true
@Awake_Today @theblaze he has neither renounced nor apologized for anything. He said a lot of this stuff in the last 12 months.
@Awake_Today @theblaze why did he lie about thousands of muslims celebrating 9/11 in jersey?  Why the Muslim ban? He's a lying bigot
@Awake_Today @theblaze trump is loved and celebrated by current, proud white nationalists, kkk and neo nazis
@Awake_Today @theblaze Byrd sought redemption and profusely apologized for and renounced his kkk past
@Awake_Today @theblaze Is it worse to befriend a guy who renounced the kkk or be supported and celebrated by current kkk/neo-nazis?
@Awake_Today @theblaze that statement is literally the opposite of true.
@Awake_Today @theblaze please re-read the meme you sent to me. It shows him with black people and said he was never accused of racism
@Awake_Today @theblaze sad that these memes circulate and they're the opposite of true. I hope you learn the truth
@Awake_Today @theblaze he was literally sued for racism in the 70's and settled.  He avoided renting to blacks and marked their applications
@Awake_Today @CarolynG1014 @theblaze check the job creation records of Dems vs GOP presidents. Numbers don't lie.
@Awake_Today @CarolynG1014 @theblaze cool story. Trickle down economics. GOP has done a good job selling that one
@Awake_Today @theblaze I'm done arguing with you because you've chosen what you want to believe. I hope he does a good job for the country
@Awake_Today @theblaze haha. This is a joke. She did say superpredators once though.
@Awake_Today @theblaze yes, he picked mike pence as his running mate, the poster boy for LGBTQ tolerance.
@Awake_Today @CarolynG1014 @theblaze the VAST majority of tax savings under trump will go to rich people. We don't need it
@Awake_Today @theblaze he does say bigoted things. That's not an opinion. It's a fact. If you agree with him, fine.
@CarolynG1014 @Awake_Today @theblaze trump is going to cut our taxes. "Elites" voting selfishly had plenty of reason to vote for him.
@GotKidsNoPeace sadly, I've listened to far too many of his incoherent ramblings.
@Awake_Today @theblaze I think you're very confused about me. I'm from a blue collar family in Ohio. No producer tells me what to say.
@jwaters142 @carrieksada this is the literal definition of islamophobia. Your fear of sharia law and muslims is irrational
@jwaters142 @carrieksada so you're imagining some transformation of america so radical that rape will become legal because of muslims???
@theblaze odd tweet when I never actually said that. Why don't you just quote what I said?

@DanOHerrin @realAngeloGomez @MeOnAJourney Fake. News. Completely false statements with no proof.
@Lyl79 @realAngeloGomez if you remove the games they lost, the Browns would be undefeated
@glorod3 @thetomzone yes and yes
@realAngeloGomez His electoral college win was one of the narrowest in history. And you can't ignore 1/8 of the country (CA) in pop vote
@_ToddJMcCarthy_ so you're delusional too?
Psychologists, how does this work?  Does he believe his own lies? For instance, does he really believe he won in an electoral landslide?
@motty_86 @CJones275 touche
@motty_86 @CJones275 i assume you want santa claus and a unicorn too
@CJones275 @motty_86 Trump is the most dishonest American presidential candidate they've ever fact checked.  Hillary one of most honest.
I don't think we've ever seen such a brazen, pathological liar ascend to such prominence in political life.  This is fascinating and scary.
We'll get the names of these celebrities he turned down along with his tax returns and his announcement that he's divested his businesses. https://t.co/ZYsmQa7dpy

@TheLeadCNN @maggieNYT @CNNPolitics if only someone would have thought to do that, say, 30 or 40 years ago. Genius!!
@JoeNBC and, as you know, GOP uses this lie win or lose. Whenever they win state election, they enact voter suppression to solidify majority
@JoeNBC most potently, it's a lie used by GOP to disenfranchise poor, elderly, minority and student voters who are more likely to vote dem
@Pipalicious1 I wish our president elect was better than conducting sensitive foreign policy on Twitter. We should all be concerned

@ClaudeKelly thank you brother

@DanielGriffith1 @realDonaldTrump I hope he proves me wrong!  I don't want the country to be less prosperous, healthy or just.
Excited to return to Essence! https://t.co/eQwg0On9Pi
@That___WhiteBoy I agree!
@DanielGriffith1 @msj5005 he only passed anything significant in the first 2 years with Ds controlling the house and senate.
@Ringneck85 I think you mean Wright. And Obama addressed this head-on in a major speech. I didn't need to hold him accountable
@RadSand @chrissyteigen haha. Y'all digging through google images now. Any shirt will do. I stand by this one.
@chrissyteigen that dummy's shirt is corny as hell
@DanielGriffith1 first of all, he was treated with the same disrespect or worse. The Tea Party, birthers, "you lie!" at SOTU, and worse.
@casidyjo323 yes, Kanye and Melania will form an anti-bullying coalition. First target:  the new President.
@DanielGriffith1 where did I say anything about hating someone?  Disagreement is not hatred
@Christaluvsu if only we could be confident that the trump disagreed with West on this. Evidence suggests not so much
@DanielGriffith1 no, it disappoints me that he said he would have voted for him, implying he agrees with him

@CindyLester9 @LuLuWhoLu @Politichick71 thank you!
@john_jjsjr @HleloN @Politichick71 the PEOPLE should decide. Not small or large states.
@bekkassso I hope you're right. I would love for him to prove me wrong.
@borababe1 peace, love, joy, positive, beauty, laugh!!!!!
@LuLuWhoLu @Politichick71 California and New York help support a lot of red states with our tax money. You're welcome.
@RowlandViki @kanyewest @realDonaldTrump @CNNPolitics Kanye's music is awesome. I agree on that!
@Politichick71 we're so used to this blue-red paradigm that we talk about votes in terms of states when we should talk in terms of people
@Politichick71 no, the voters would decide. Wherever they are, they would count equally. Their state of residence would be irrelevant.
@Politichick71 one person, one vote would be the fairest, most representative system. Clearly
@Politichick71 but they get credit for their 2 senators also. The same as big states. So it proportionally adds more weight to small states
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard by my logic, a farmer in Iowa would literally have the exact same vote as an elitist liberal singer in LA :)
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard and swing state voters get more impact than solid red or blue state voters, which is also unfair
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard the only way all votes count equally is to use the popular vote. Elec college weighs small state voters more
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard yes he won a lot more counties. This is the correct # though. And she won millions more votes (actual people)
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard https://t.co/oMuT7Ms7du
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard odd that you think people's votes should count more in sparsely populated areas. Why?
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard the counties argument is irrelevant anyway. But these are not the facts. I'm sorry.
@lgothard agreed on the nobody's perfect comment!  God bless America!
@SeanSea120 @PhinsDiehard My father worked in a factory everyday for 30 years and never made over $50K/yr.  He is a working man.
@SeanSea120 @PhinsDiehard There are a lot of people working very hard to make 25, 35, 45k/yr.  It's said you're so disdainful of them.
@PhinsDiehard I am fully aware of the electoral college and the rules of the election.  He will be president.  Enjoy.
@PhinsDiehard this is a completely false statement.  It's sad that so many false facts are floating around.  Believe what you like though.
@Annalou321 ummm, Hillary won lower-income voters (under $50K) and got the most votes overall.  These are facts.
