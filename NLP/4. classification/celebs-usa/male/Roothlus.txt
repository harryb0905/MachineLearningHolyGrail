@BenbaLamb @JonathanDepa @DarryllFish onions are min top 3
@mbradycf @JoeyWeissman The texture and utility of it are the worst of all the veggies
@Marshall_LR @security_spike @bmkibler Phew close call 😂
@DarryllFish good call but I honestly like most veggies except for peas and asparagus. so yeah those
It's inexplicable to me how much worse peas are than any other vegetable.

@onceharby Yes. Fortnite will keep the casual gamers but this will be the bar for competitive gaming for the next year
@JonAguiar Booked
@JonAguiar https://t.co/aNMi7IR9i0
@JonAguiar @dwpoker @Wretchy @herberheezy @Matthew_Waxman lol booked
@dwpoker @Wretchy @herberheezy @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar hah. nah, i'm good but we're booked 🤑
@dwpoker @Wretchy @herberheezy @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar my max wager is $100 per person. winning $100 from 4 people is way more fun than winning $400 from 1
@dwpoker @herberheezy @Wretchy @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar https://t.co/vcNPFqV9qp
@herberheezy @dwpoker @Wretchy @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar ill take $100 from both of you guys and Jon
@Wretchy @dwpoker @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar I'm fine with June 3rd-5th (Mon-Wed) to minimize randomness
@Wretchy @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar @dwpoker whatever's fair but twitch is the litmus test for popularity. could use mixer and another streaming app. and fortnite has almost a year on "total users" so that doesn't seem fair
@Wretchy @Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar @dwpoker Sure. $100 that Apex is beating Fortnite in avg concurrent viewers over a 72 hour period by April. So whatever April 1st-April 3rd average is.
@Matthew_Waxman @JonAguiar @dwpoker Place your bets
@dwpoker @herberheezy @JonAguiar No doubt. Fortnite is unreal for what it is. Just saying, Apex is the next big competitive game and will be more popular on Twitch than Fortnite by sayyy April 1st, whatever metric seems fairest.  Happily bet that
@JonAguiar @dwpoker No doubt. That concert was a brilliant integration. Just saying 100 mil downloads in FOUR days.
@dwpoker @JonAguiar Fortnite will still do fine. But it's peaked and will find it's niche as the casual game, not the esport it thought maybe it could be.
@JonAguiar have you or @dwpoker played Apex yet? The game is 🔥🔥🔥
@dwpoker @GinoGallizzi get back to me in a month
@dwpoker @GinoGallizzi didn't know that but NAH.

@NuckleDuDang @BrandonReese24
The dust has settled from the PSPC/PCA and it's safe to say Poker Stars is still the industry standard. Still good to see Party Poker making things competitive. Feel good about the current state of poker and looking forward to more massive guarantees down the road.

@dDeoxyribo @stapes @J_Hartigan hand deoxy was talking about. hand never gets old😂 https://t.co/Wf0LeTk3gT
Two weeks into the year and I've already seen VR mentioned a lot. On socials, in shows, at friends' houses and it's mostly Beat Saber. That game seems awesome. With esports breaking through in 2018, VR blowing up in 2019 just makes sense.
@Stapes Yeah. Three hour immersive seminar where I teach you aerials, demos, and how to juggle for the low, low price of $999. Act now!!

Got 56th, gg, back to the US, see yaaa
Was supposed to fly home yesterday but got player party fomo, hopped in the $1k 30min levels, bagged, partied and now we’re back for day 2 itm with 30bigs and a dream 💪💪💪
@MissGallo @InfatuationLA @schmooey Animal if you haven't been yet for brunch,
@PokerStars thanks! got in a quick mincash then ran into Aces. #cantcomplain
Took 2nd in the $109 @PokerStars Mini Super Tuesday for $12.9k last night. Only reason I grinded online was bc of making day 3 in that silly PSPC 😂💪 https://t.co/7H0QWjQsh2
@AppstOnSome @PokerStars awesome
Poker is comedy. Dude just started open ripping 30 bigs on the @PokerStars live stream then goes all in blind for last 7 bigs from bb. Hope someone clipped that. 🤯🤯🤯
@JoeyWeissman Thought you were talking about not giving 1 space when 3 stalls. But nah, this is actually one of the few places where I haven't left my Hydroflask😂
@Stapes Yeah but your social media promotional game is way stronger. Point, Stapes.
@ChubbyCrypto All that matters is she didn’t say call, all in, or fold. Most of these players know to wait for an action and/or confirmation from the dealer anyways. Also, it’s edited down so there may have been some other words said prior.
@ChubbyCrypto Nope, they don’t, and yes
This is definitely the most anticipated Bahamian comedy event of 2019!! https://t.co/ppwzenhEpD
This was the fold I was astonished by yesterday. She doesn't even react after being shown Aces. What a savage!! https://t.co/En4YN5bfER
@MeganVyvlecka @DarryllFish (Not so) lazy river indeed
the hand is replaying rn on twitch https://t.co/XhCPgGkk5C
@Stapes capers and olives are two of the worst foods on the planet. i'm with you ✊🏽
@KingAlikMJ23 Wasn’t reported but simplest way would be if AQ called a 3bet all the way to the river, raised and got shoved on
@CarJamPark That’s pretty much all of us
Take a casual stroll through the tournament area, decide to watch one hand with cameras filming it, see AQ fold face-up on AQQ7K board for heaps and get shown Aces. Wow. Above the rim poker being played out there.
Side note: did not realize this was actually a FIVE DAY TOURNEY like the PSPC . Just virtual bagged into day 3 after 3 hours of play. Now I understand why even @Moorman1, the grinder of all grinders, said he wouldn't reg it. Not even itm!! #fml 😂
@JonAguiar enticing but can't. others should definitely attend
@MichaelJosem @cardplayerlife @PokerStars biggest non-SHR event**. I don't really count those
@JasonMercier lol i highly doubt it
Big thanks to @PokerStars for making this event happen! Biggest prize pool ever outside of the WSOP Main.
Geeg $25k PSPC. Silver lining: timed it perfectly to max late reg day 2 of the mini PSPC $25 #grinder

Didn’t make a hand better than one pair or pick up Kings or Aces all day so  pretty stoked to bag 75k into 1200bb tomorrow. 💪💪💪
Table is 8.5/10 toughness but 9/10 chats so it’s a tradeoff. 70k from 60k starting four hours in.

Will be in #airplanemode all day 1 of the $25k minus the breaks to practice for National 🚫 Internet Day (April 4th) obviously 😝

@mtgworth @dwpoker amazing.  I don't mind hearing stories like that since you know there's more to it, like that TJ Cloutier story where the dude mucked 10s and those outs somehow got shuffled back in the deck to beat him.
@Lance_Bradley @PokerStarsLIVE i meant give Lance the pass 🙃
@PokerStarsLIVE Jason Koon. I deserve a Platinum Pass now!
@PittPoker borderline a good beat. could have definitely just finished 5th with internet completely fine :D. internet outage is the worst thing that can happen to a grinder
@Derms17 wow owned. that's definitely my phone case. wracking my brain trying to remember but drawing a blank😂
@RyanTYFL Can’t just noise cancel your way out of a convo not at the table lol
@KingAlikMJ23 Sometimes I ask recs innocently to make convos forgetting that’s how the convo will go
I’ve listened to so many bad beat stories at this point that I can no longer even fake care about your Aces getting cracked

1. @SolomunMusic for Cercle @ Theatre Antique d'Orange in Vaucluse, FR  https://t.co/lzrO7hqhN6  @CercleMusic does it again convincing one of the best DJs in the world to play in an ancient Roman amphitheater. Naturally, this set was a masterpiece.🙌😍🤯  HMU with your favorites!
2. @HONEYDIJON for Sugar Mountain in Melbourne, AU https://t.co/PvcbV2dUgy  I really like the way this stage is set up. Honey Dijon surrounded by the warmth and energy of the crowd while delivering a perfect hour-long set. Get goosebumps watching it every time.
3. @BillyKennyMusic Truth in Johannesburg, SA https://t.co/l3GtCm1St3  I've never heard a crowd so hype. Multiple times the crowd starts chanting loudly over the music and Billy eats it up playing a phenomenal set, even giving heartfelt praise of the crowd at the very end.
4. @FatBoySlim for Cercle @ the i360 in Brighton, UK https://t.co/oseA5tTgnt  Cercle managed to get Fat Boy Slim to play a set in the i360, a moving observational tower in the heart of Brighton. Love how into it he gets.

@theczar19 @ShannonShorr Thought maybe my taste buds would change like they did for mushrooms but nah olives still suck
@YegorMo This food nightmare includes but is not limited to asparagus, stuffed cabbage and grapefruits
@ShannonShorr The smell, the taste, basically everything
My worst nightmare includes being trapped in the olive bar area of Whole Foods
Honestly think since I voted the algorithms are like oh we know he went to a polling station so we’ll chill on all that. Thanks Big Brother 🙌🙃
Stop thinking in terms of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's all a construct. I rarely have 3 meals anymore. Think in terms of putting fuel into the machine that is your body and if it needs more or less. Don't just eat to eat (even though I am definitely guilty of this too).

@SteveRuddock @jesswelman Can we agree that eggs, avocadoes and coffee for breakfast is healthier than the above one? Obviously there are outliers with the way each of our bodies react but overall I’d think certain foods are very clearly healthier than others. Saying it’s complicated seems like a cop out.
@jesswelman @SteveRuddock Depends on how you look at it. Just let there still be Nashville hot chicken in that future 🙏🏻🤤
@jesswelman @r0llingame Dry flavored Eggos are where it’s at tbh
@SteveRuddock @jesswelman In ten years it will all be solved and food might just be a pill that has all the nutrients needed for your body type. There’s no way we will regress in ten years.
@jesswelman I completely agree there. It can be overwhelming figuring it all out.
@jesswelman Growing up we all thought a nutritious breakfast included cereal, milk, toast and orange juice as per all cereal boxes and I doubt many people think that now so clearly we must have collectively figured out something.
Yeah health and nutrition is far more complicated than we ever thought but think about what the average person knew about it two years ago and what that person knows now. A lot of progress being made in a short time after many years of misdirection and misinformation.
@Charnizard I like to think this period of stagnation will lead to an explosion of new great music from artists you’ve never heard of and OGs who saw this coming and started experimenting (Boys Noize, A-Trak, etc)

@Charnizard @MikeyLion_ @DesertHearts in
@Daniel_Blum not entirely fair. I stated I welcomed opinions so that I could watch more. the whole purpose of posting arbitrary rankings is to generate conversation about the topic, not be told yeah i'm right. where's the fun in that? also, ain't nobody got time to watch every heist movie.
@EthanGreene1 no but looks great. WIll watch
Top Three Takeaways from #HeistGate 1. I need to fucking see Heat in it's entirety. That seems unanimous.  2. Pumped how many good heist movies there are that I haven't seen. 3. People take rankings way too seriously and it's hilarious.
@jesswelman haha no worries :). just all in good fun.
Humbling but kinda enjoyable when the internet tells you how wrong you are
@jesswelman @SteveRuddock top five is so clearly a "my favorites list" lol. no one's going to make a list of things they haven't tried, thus it's their favorites. #semantics and it's better for making people engage

Onto day 4 with  211k @ 10k big. Had QQ&lt;KK for a bit and lost some other big pots so happy to still be fighting. 48 left. #FIGHT ✊

82k at first break. Two hands after the break, got 210k @ 4k BB🕺🕺🕺. #letsgo
@efropoker I got 120 million reasons why he doesn’t care
Made it to day 3 of @WPT Gardens with 144k into 3kbb. 120 left, 73 pay. It may not be this event, it may not be this WPT season, but I look forward to winning one of these at some point. Gonna happen.

@jdolbeer Also if it’s pho, it’s trash **ducks** 😂
Imagine a pho place without a pun 🤯
@RJA87 Been busy 🤓
Fantasy football season begins NOW
@steveodwyer @tritonpoker Stickler Steve! So is WPT at Hawaiian Gardens but the point is it won’t command as much attention. And if there ever was an off-season it would begin now.
Poker off-season begins now. Return to your regularly scheduled timelines.
Fat finger typos🤷🏻‍♂️. Whatevah
Congrats @JustinBonomo!!! Hope it feels good ebingnthe number one end boss in the world now! 👏🏆🎉
@TWKftw This is starting to get pretty meta. Deal with dealing with it!
@TWKftw It’s just endless whining about it. We get it, people don’t like Hellmuth. Would we rather have Ali &amp; Nick? Yes. Is there anything that can be done? No. Deal with it.
POKER PLAYERS STOP BITCHING ABOUT COMMENTARY AND GO GET SOME ICE CREAM🤬🙄
@no_limit_gg @CrownUpGuy @WushuTM @JoeyWeissman 👀
@TWKftw @MigTheTig @DanSmithHolla @Ali_Nejad @NickSchulman Deleted? Was funny #justajoke
@YakshaNZ damn. i asked a friend and he said it works. cant trust 'em!
The respective poker community thanks David Einhorn for bubbling
@bmkibler @GEICOGaming congrats! get Shiro into a Geico commercial pls 🙏.
@plenopads @EmpireMaker2 Canadian guy who was grinding Borgata tourneys three years ago and apparently now plays cash games in Macau. Confusing tbh. Prob met some billionaires 🤷🏻‍♂️
@RemkoRinkema @WSOP All of the above. Insane summer
@PhilGalfond @phil_hellmuth This has the makings of a sitcom that I’d totally watch
@EmpireMaker2 “Recreational player” 🧐
@subiime @msalsberg @ShaneSchleger @WillieMcFML @BJNemeth Need chicken wing updates por favor
@subiime 🧐🧐🧐
Last night was a battle for the ages. John Cynn truly earned his victory to become the world champ. Tony Miles with the bluff of a lifetime. What a night to remember!
@zbeg Regarding mentality**
@zbeg And I agree with most of it tbh
🥊🥊🥊 https://t.co/VYEpTNW4rV
That hand was sososo awesome. Both players playing great ball. We’re in for a helluva battle now!!
Unreal move Tony Miles!!! #heart
Pound for pound the best poker player around https://t.co/wkp55kmhgD
@JustinBonomo @Protentialmn @DarrenElias “Playing perfectly” is shorthand for saying they thought they played to the best of their ability, not to the best of anyone’s ability. That said, they probably still didn’t play perfectly 😂
Whoa. Real talk https://t.co/WEO1zdZbMr
@Stapes I’m glad you are finally being up front about this dark secret
@PhilGalfond You present a good point. It really doesn’t take much in such a massive pot but it’s a complicated spot on the biggest stage of his life so now may not be a good time to decide to bluff.
@PhilGalfond Fair but I legitimately think he’s never betting the river there
@NormanChad if you’d like to attend @EDC_LasVegas to listen to EDM next year I’ll happily be your festival guide 😂🕺
@Stapes @espn Poker!!
@real_leftynow @Stapes i'm on it!!
@jamesharhi his hoodie is sweet
Zobian needs to win so everyone thinks poker players are the coolest and actually know how to dress
Luck is sweet
Coolness rankings: 1. Zobian
@theejimharrison @PokerGO It’s not on tsn?
Also Artem Metalidi (artem205) deserves some love. Been playing for years on the EPT/online grind. Had 60k (6k bb)to start day 4 at my table, turned that into 450k when table broke 30min in—never looked back.
@DiMoDoMo @cada99 That would also be an unreal feat!
If you are looking for someone to root for at the final table, root for Tony Miles! Played with him day 4 and had great vibes. Also a fellow Floridian!
https://t.co/lW7ElVagGu
No spoilers but just make sure you are watching the Main Event stream in 20minutes. Trust me.
You can hate or love him but you gotta respect him @phil_hellmuth. 15 bracelets is no joke. Well done 👏
Whack. GG @Stoyven. #goodjobgoodeffort
It’s @Stoyven vs the evil empire. Let’s gooo!! Bracelet no. 3 por favor
So true 👌 https://t.co/85p2EwY6p3
Let’s gooo @Stoyven!! Please beat Phil heads up🤞🏼 https://t.co/M8ttv5TwJL
@Jeff_Trudeau @PokerNews Way to rep Florida. Great run 🙌
Two days since busting out so now I can be a fan of the game again instead of hate sweating everyone that I played with 😂.

@thinkingpoker Yeah, just wasn't the same :D
Fun interview https://t.co/MeyGtKewPs
Lost a 2.4mil chip pot with A♣️Q♥️vs A♠️7♠️ all in on A♥️Q♠️8♠️5♥️board 😭😭😭.   182nd for $42k.   This tournament was so much fun. Battled incredibly hard for 5 days. Thanks to everyone who was rooting me on!
8-way raised pot at my table and I’m the idiot who folded 😂
Reunited! Day 1, 2, and 5 tablemates. #prettycool https://t.co/fKbP2BAR7O
990k 30k bb after 99&lt;1010 for 20bigs. ~200 left, guaranteed $49k. #beenherebefore
All the chip counts were wrong, I’m actually at 1.4mil 🚀🚀🚀🙃
Whenever I swap in a tournament I think that’s what Wu Tang Financial would do https://t.co/jHf1H9Bk4T
At the end of the day our table took a we-just-made-day-5 pic. That’s what this is all about!! Also, money. Lots of it.
Heading to day 5 with 470k with an hour left in 20k bb, 300 left. Definitely was a tough day but still breathing!!
@DarwynsTheory Got emmm
Whatever happens from here on out I talked a guy into 3bet folding getting 2.3:1 after I cold 4bet all in for 19bbs so there’s that. Had AJdd. Creating fold equity is sweet.   540k with 1 hour left of 20k bb to be played in the day #livepoker
Got twenty bigs and a dream 🤞🏼🚀🔥. 1.5 levels left in the day. 440 players left. Guaranteed ~$30k
275k into 12k bb on dinner break. Minimal things go right but no one said this would be easy. Time to spin up!!
630k on break. Swingy level. Played a lot of pots, lost most of them 😋. 10k bb next.
🚀🚀🚀MILLY ALERT🚀🚀🚀1.05 @ 8k bb
Day 3 ahead of schedule, 680k directly itm.
@theczar19 Awesome 👌
Coming back from dinner break at 5k bb, have 480k. Last level left in the day, ~105 from the $$$. #finishstrong
New table, first orbit three-way hand on board of Ah8h2h9c action is bet, 30k, raise to 300k, all in for 320k, fold, fold.   Same guy THREE HANDS LATER gets it in for 1.5mil pot Aces vs Kings. Thinks river Jack is a King then realizes it’s not. 😂🤷🏻‍♂️🔥🤯
370k after Aces&gt;Kings. Play as skillful as you want, but sometimes it just doesn’t matter.
@PokercastAdam Unsure. Couldn’t really ask in the midst of all the drama. Was table over but provided me with a good laugh.
@Matt_B_Walton Couldn’t figure it out exactly
Played live poker for a long time and just witnessed a dealer get white hot mad at a player. Floor comes by and cools it down. Two minutes later dealer gets even more mad and storms off flailing his arms in disgust. Never seen this before. Can’t help but laugh. Getting tense!
238k @ 3kbb. Under 2k people left.
325k
@Rotonda Yeah dude we got this! 😂
First break, day 3, 2400bb. Had a crazy level where I went from 117k to 160k to 37k to 190k. #peaking
Appreciate @WSOP adjusting the dinner break from 60min to 75min today👏
oh god https://t.co/fsLzFNPsN9
Had no idea Marcelo was so damn good. Unreal game. This World Cup has been 🔥🔥🔥
Uh oh. We got a game!! Shoutout to the Telemundo announcer for the 20 second GOOOOAL every time
Onto day 3 with 114k. Day off tomorrow, back at it Saturday.
87k on linner break. 500/1k when we return. Peak, 110k, valley 54k, feels good to have it 87.
@palmbeachr Nice 😉
@esportslaw @iamshinerk Otherworldly
@iamshinerk Cool find! @esportslaw
@Lance_Bradley Gulp
@Gags30poker Down to grind
Also poker is going through a resurgence and I love it.
Whoa. Lost a 55k pot with 30 min left but still battled back to finish with 96.7k. Day2B Thursday. This tournament is so much fun. Shoutout Bobby The Bus @Daniel_Blum 🚌
🚨🚨SIX FIGURE ALERT🚨🚨105k at 500bb. 50min left in the day. #finishstrong
Come to think of it #sorrynotsorry is the perfect embodiment of what a poker player feels after busting an opponent. Feeling of I care a little bit about that bad beat/cooler/whatever I put on you but also thanks for the chipsss ✌🏻
Break 2, have 70k from 50k. Probably played smallest all in and a call thus far in entire tourney (10bigs total Q9&gt;66). Busted a nice guy’s hopes and dreams from Jacksonville. #sorrynotsorry
@Rotonda @WSOP Hahaha nice
Playing Day 1B of the @WSOP Main today. Here’s the plan for the tournament. Airplane mode now, ✌🏻 https://t.co/cOulIidxXc
@Bearw8 probably but understandable
@Kevmath @WSOP  https://t.co/bwEqbWO8Iw
@grossblue Nope! Unreal perfect storm of things happened in that hand
Yeah, so the Main Event low-key starts today. Just real low-key the biggest, baddest poker tournament with by far the largest prize pool in the world starts today and finishes...NEXT WEEK (if you're lucky)😂. It's a test of endurance, mental stamina, and sheer focus. GET PUMPED!!
Whoa congrats on the bracelet @BrokeLivingJRB! $5k 6-max one of the tougher tournaments, well done👏. Also this 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/uf41IhOtjy
@cmenke1 i was planning on it this month but found myself wanting to work on my game more and it's been really helpful doing that instead. definitely WCOOP though

@TreMomey This is a new revelation for me so definitely at some point I could try again and test it out but I’d be willing to bet 12-tabling/grinding tons is just not optimal for me anymore, maybe never was.
@Lara_Miller only there for one more week then Vegas baby 🕺
Wrote an article on taking a deep dive back into poker and how to fix old bad habits. Read here: https://t.co/GLc7RjOYCH
@KrukPoker You are right that a lot of is variance but there is no doubt that a good mindset, approach, framework to poker can make up for not being able to put your best foot forward day in, day out. Also, not everyone may necessarily need to do that.
@Joeingram1 you playing the main?? have you ever played the main???🧐

@Pantaleooo @PokerStars Been the plan all along 😉. Can’t miss the main!
@themouthmatusow wasn't about that. just trying to develop a good routine so i can perform my best
So I won the Double Deuce and the $16.50 Deepstacks PSKO on @PokerStars for $20k total. The money’s great but it’s not about that. It immediately validated my decision to study, grind online, and work on my mental game over playing WSOP events. Feels good. 🙌#respecttheprocess

@RadaWilinofsky @BrianWSOP @DarryllFish @olivierbusquet That’s cool Rada 🙌
@Daniel_Blum So basically someone winning a poker tournament early in their career haha
@RadaWilinofsky @DarryllFish Poker isn’t tech—it’s a game. Why are we comparing it to writing or technology?That’s incredibly broad and seems like an easy way to give you an upper hand here. From my own two eyes you should just trust me as well as Fish on being right and move on. Experience over theory.
@olivierbusquet @DarryllFish @RadaWilinofsky @ING You started this dumb convo, can’t bail now
@DarryllFish @RadaWilinofsky @olivierbusquet The Main Event had 111 countries represented last year. As a game/sport goes that’s pretty diverse. Poker is not only upper middle class—just go to your local casino to figure that one out. All walks of life converging at the table over a game. That’s fucking cool!
@VonStroke Uhhhh @OnTheBusCast
Sounds lovely! https://t.co/XEPzI1Vqc4
@Daniel_Blum What is irrationality? Is it nonsense or is it thinking too emotionally? Maybe the rational take input from the emotional but not the irrational? 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️🙃

@Anton_Wigg @DarryllFish @plenopads @ElleSriracha @bpnutrition While Bulletproof started the craze, they branded it as though you NEEDED Bulletproof coffee beans in order to make it but that is false.

@MoveTiMe99 @DickieUtz @plenopads Ya swing and a miss. Should have been #TeamHellmuth. #jokeanalysis
@jesswelman Resources no longer an issue if travel and lodging is paid for by WPT. Also maybe they spruce up the prize pool a little bit accounting for their time? 🧐 #justspitballinghere
@_tizzle I think you are underestimating what it may be like in the stands for the fans especially if they start cheering for their players and how crowds can create a vibe. Down to discuss over dinner for sure!
@_tizzle I like this as a longer convo actually because I don’t think it’s an easy answer when you couple in online poker with it

@ImAllInNow @Liv_Boeree Well, I'm a man so I'm making a parallel. On the internet it can be hard to figure out the tone of a tweet. Female empowerment? An efficiency thing? Regardless, makeup seems like a great way for people to get around a physical insecurity they may have by covering it up.
@Liv_Boeree I'm thrown off by the purpose of this tweet. Egyptian women created makeup around 4000 B.C. to appease the gods. Also while men do take less time to shave, would you rather men never shave or trim?
@MiamiErikC LOL wut 😂
@Lara_Miller Appreciate it. Playing poker again and enjoying it 👨🏻‍💻

@adamkorth @DougPolkPoker There’s a lot. People will go there over yelp for example to find hot spots for food, music, etc. If snap adds alerts or a search button they can give you hot spots as you walk past or businesses can put discounts on the map to drive biz and pay snap to be on there.

@jesswelman When you see Bitconnect take people for one of the biggest exit scams in history, you start to change your tune. Privacy is cool but the tech behind it is more important.
@jesswelman Saying this "does not sound great" is misleading. This seems like veiled good news and something that makes sense in terms of states protecting their citizens and one step (of the many) towards regulation.

@sbrounder @DougPolkPoker he didn't blatantly lie. If it was blatant he would have had an answer ready immediately. he was clearly flustered and chose to not go down that rabit hole. would you want to air your family's dirty laundry?
Thoroughly enjoyed this podcast. Lots of good insight! https://t.co/4r8okyZCp6
@DougPolkPoker seems like this is something he didn't want to get into and was thrown off by the question. then was just like yeah poker. do you want to tell 1mill viewers that your dad was involved in some shady dealings? probably not.

@DarryllFish @ikepoker @DanOBrienPoker @TuckonSports We have very clearly thrown caring about nutrition out the window for this convo. Also cheesy gordita  crunch is a creative masterpiece and so is the McGriddle.

@realcharder30 Then you’ve never had good roti but also you like grapefruit and I despise it sooo 🤷🏻‍♂️

@Mandy22Baker @Joeingram1 I’m definitely going to find a GameCube and play it again. Nostalgic about Super Mario Kart convincing my dad to get it first night it came out.
@KidLiquid hell yes!
@Joeingram1 yeah maybe some but don't underestimate gamers. I think I've played every single Mario Kart at least once including the DS ones. Only other one up for discussion seemed to be Double Dash which was def an oversight in my poll.
Landslide victory for N64 but no surprise there. Side note: does anyone have a couple spare N64s, 4 controllers, and Mario Kart in the LA area?? 👀
@matzahball3r Well played. Always Other!
@ChannelFireball Squadron Hawk and cross fingers
@Elibrownbeats @mant @SolamusicUK @solardomusic Uhhh @iamTchami &amp; @Malaamusic def dropped it around 35min of their Ultra set.

@KidLiquid I'm starting to see the errors of my ways 😂
@AnjonRoy damn, haven't played this one in a decade. need to do that asap
Best Mario Kart
@JosephLiberta yeah them too. They seem aight
@MiamiErikC @Andrewbadecker yeah he's probably the reason Russ stayed tbh
@youcantsaythat They feel like an incomplete team to me this year, especially with the big trade. Rather see Utah who seem like a budding squad annoy Houston. Hopefully LAC makes good moves in the offseason
@MiamiErikC yeah at least he'll have a series prior to western finals to get back in rhythm
@Andrewbadecker if Roberson was healthy I'd say it's not a done deal but yeah, no shot now. I'm an OKC truther
@DarwynsTheory @diplo just downloaded it tonight 🕺🏻
Looking at the NBA standings makes me realize this year's playoffs is going to be the sickest ever. Mouthwatering first round matchups (OKC/MIN) and lots of fiery, young squads (MIL/UTA/NO). And then hopefully HOU/GSW?!🤞🤤

@callingallfats Day is made! 🤤
@stoffmakers They are crunchy, salty, sweet, and a little spicy iirc. It’s been a while. Had them for first time at Ike’s in SF. Also can get it in New Orleans
@aletz99 Ruffles Verdes sounds tasty
@OMGNima Unsure. Think they’re #6.
@Protentialmn Love dill, pickle ehhh
@paulgees81 These look legit. Will try them if I ever see them
@msalsberg 😭spirit crushed. Whatever, it’s staying. There’s like eighty ingredients in Doritos, maybe potato is one of them 🤷🏻‍♂️

@audavidb @RealKidPoker @Gags30poker @DBuzgon @TabDuchateau @ARIAPoker I do think the "chip and a chair" mentality is a great aspect to the game of NL and it makes everyone feel like even though they are down, they are not out. I can see how BB ante would take away from this and if Cary has thought of an alternative to that, I'm for it.
@RealKidPoker @Gags30poker @DBuzgon @TabDuchateau @ARIAPoker 🤦🏻‍♂️ should have read whole thread. I just saw it seeming like you were opposed to the BB ante rule and I was like oh hell nah. Carry on.
@RealKidPoker @Gags30poker @DBuzgon @TabDuchateau @ARIAPoker Dealer's job is more stressful telling players time and time again to ante. It has to get frustrating at some point and decrease efficiency on their end. This helps players AND dealers. There are very small downsides to this change and businessmen being sad isn't one of them.
This is too good😂😂😂 https://t.co/VttjJl3ftj
@RealKidPoker @Gags30poker @DBuzgon @TabDuchateau @ARIAPoker Okay, so let's not change the rule for the random rich fish, got it.

@zedmaster84 Obviously there are sooo many types but it’s hard to narrow it down to be brief in a tweet to get the point across. Tech house(124-126bpm) is where I reside
@jeremysleon @Stapes Always. #zoomout
@jeremysleon @Stapes I agree. Sometimes on Twitter you have to embellish a little to really get your point across otherwise it falls flat. Just reiterating that it’s no longer a fad and bigger than you think. Good chats though
@dreaaathomas @TLentz53 @ABC @adamlevitan Unreal 😂
@jeremysleon @Stapes Semantics! That’s just fun to exclaim but movement is social, political OR artistic. So yeah def a movement. The 1000+ electronic music focused festivals around the world should be evident of that. Was the Woodstock era not a movement either?
@Stapes I feel sorry for your ears 😞
@dwpoker @Marshall_LR Awww you’re cute David 😘
@NTellier85 @MovementDetroit Yeah. One of these days! https://t.co/FpPQCuE3wu
I’ve come to the conclusion electronic music (house music, techno, even dubstep) is a movement. It is not a genre and you cannot escape it. And that makes me so fucking happy. 🕺🕺🕺
@mtgworth @Marshall_LR @DougPolkPoker It’s a hard thing to balance. Some RTs just to get info out there, some for friends/projects you want to help to spread the word about, then just funny shit

At its core, poker is a beautiful fucking game. Battle against eight opponents while constantly battling with your own psyche and fitness to keep yourself as sharp as possible. And even then still that might not be enough because there’s this thing called luck!
@Charnizard Moon Boots, Bonobo, Four Tet, Lane 8, Caribou solid start. Think you’re on to something
The support for this has been incredible. @ARizzo44 @Matthew_Waxman #MSDStrong https://t.co/DAiB1yCuAx
@HighkeyItsMykey Been saying this for a minute! LA house scene is unreal. Either this or the next CRSSD!
Wow. Pendulum, Boys Noize, Prydz/Cirez D. Best lineup since 2014 https://t.co/O335fPesxU
@mtgworth Thanks Worth. Appreciate it
Fuck. This is literally hitting close to home. Graduated from Stoneman Douglas High School. Parkland considered one of the safest areas in south Florida.😔
@BillyKennyMusic So good 👌

@PatrickDarmody @joerogan @duncantrussell @overwatchleague @JamieVernon I am not but still a fun game to be terrible at
Watching the @JoeRogan pod with @DuncanTrussell and they’re talking about having their own @Overwatchleague on Twitch. Make it happen @JamieVernon!

@Joeingram1 @DougPolkPoker Papi Does MTTs coming this WSOP
I wonder if he hasn’t updated his phone to 280 or he just communicates like he’s on AIM normally. Good vibes though. https://t.co/afWlCI7sx0
@DetlefMusic hahaha amazing. I was legit like wtf is going on rn lolol
@DetlefMusic yo dude. was watching an old ep of Parks &amp; Recreation where Detlef Schrempf was in it and then "Turn My Swag On" came on and Tom Haverford started jamming out to it. Is this all a coincidence?? 🤔 https://t.co/L2ssErA9Sl
@elonmusk yeah but what about Russell Westbrook owning the Warriors right now
@Lance_Bradley @PokerGO @ikepoker @PokerCentral @ARIAPoker 102!
@PokerGO @ikepoker @PokerCentral @ARIAPoker Lets go Stevie! Fun fact: Stevie once won 100 WSOP ME seats playing Steps on Stars one year
@misterashmoney booked🙃
@zbeg yeah it's hard when in order to practice you need to have access to equipment and/or have people around to give you feedback. prob worth buying cheap decks just to screw around if you want to do it though
have always respected djs but after doing it on level 0 and seeing how tough that was, it's even more impressive watching the best do it.
DJ'ed my first set this weekend. Yeah so what if it was an unplanned RV set at our camp site and yeah so what if I had no clue how to beat match. Amazing feeling when you get people reacting positively to the tracks you are picking on the fly.
@BrittanyFurlan it's how I discovered Daft Punk. Always had the best vids on there. Never called in though.
@RadaWilinofsky Yup agreed. Helps carry the convo along
@RadaWilinofsky Sometimes there’s nothing that can be said to improve upon the original tweet.
@zbeg And in more modern times, so was Wing Dings
Awesome! https://t.co/jXq8PnYtJx
@claytoncomic Took three classes of improv but nah. Would try an open mic st some point though. Just a good metaphor for life
If you don’t ever bomb, you’re not taking enough risks.
@jvfricke yeah I knew there was some sort of joke there but also knew I could completely bomb so nitted it up like I always do 😂

Wish the Lefty Anarchists of America (LAA) would actually do something. Let’s all walk on the left side of the sidewalk one day!
@RadaWilinofsky I'm not seeing it. Think he's the best of the bunch. Has many quirks but never gives into any social pressures regarding them. Personality shines through all of that like when he gets on the cooking show https://t.co/iJ4F0D0Pzg

@CaryCrypto @Joeingram1 This would be amazing actually
@Marshall_LR @CCalcano I played Calcano once. It was a swift and painless L which is probably what it’s like for most of his opponents. #thelegendofcalcano
And then blockchain was mentioned by someone at the bar. Five minutes later SkyNet was brought up. Confirmed in the future
@THAY3R @Joeingram1 Seems like the ultimate bet. Biggest proponent of four cards being forced to play with only two. Also he hates it with a passion. On the flip he’s got some sick willpower.
Currently eating at a breakfast bar at 11PM on a Friday night. THE FUTURE IS HERE!!! #nighthawk
@Joeingram1 No clue. Just think it would be a sweet bet for CryptoPapi
@KrukPoker @Joeingram1 I think you should make a bet where you play NL tournaments for a year
@Charnizard You got this Charnimono!!🕺🕺🕺

@nick_colletti in there
Finally @DarryllFish walks away with a @WPT title!!! Couldn't have happened to a better dude! #imamped 🏆🎉
@gostatego3 it's when the most money is at stake. can't be that big of a deal when heads up is usually going to take a while anyways
Oh also action clock extensions should refill heads up with maybe one or two 2-minute extensions. Watching Jake Schindler/Vogelsang play heads up in the $300k with no time extensions seemed unfair.
So @DarryllFish currently heads up for his first @WPT title and the last two Florida Hard Rock WPTs he placed 2nd and 3rd. Needs more praise!! #homefeltadvantage
@DougPolkPoker @apestyles 👀
@shortbuspoker complicated answer that's above my paygrade but think the short-term negatives seem worse than the long-term positives. Also, this is a global issue in a burgeoning industry. It would stunt too many businesses at a critical point in their development process.
@BlakeBvP Exactly! Which is why this 30% tariff is even more ridiculous
@jordancormack47 @MasonMaynard Also to LA!

I’m perplexed by this new Justin Timberlake track. On one hand the beat is legitimately “Filthy” and considering it’s a Timbaland beat I’m pumped for him to come back. That said it doesn’t fit the song. Love that it’s got some wobble to it though. 🧐🤷🏻‍♂️🤔
@NeerajKA Comment is perfect 😂😂😂 https://t.co/YZBxnNP08T
@MattGlantz also why poker is great. ego cements quickly and takes a while for one to realize that initial win wasn't skill but mostly luck. some never do
replace trade with tournament win and this is completely true for poker as well https://t.co/DBlTu8hCqm
@germanotes shoutout @djsnake!
@catehall I like seeing tweets like this. For years I didn’t listen bc of this but he’s toned it down over recently and gets into thought-provoking convos with some fascinating people. Lawrence Krauss, Bret Weinstein, Rhonda Patrick to name a few

@cuntycakes123 wug KickICO
@VanessaSelbst @jvfricke I misspoke. Was having this dumb fight while shopping at Whole Foods. Not binary but only answers are white and black, not 14 options
@VanessaSelbst @jvfricke I'm not seeing it really. There's not going to be 14 diff answers like there could be with the gender spectrum--it's binary.
@VanessaSelbst @jvfricke All good. Didn't feel like you were attacking me and generally I want to keep things light and this really wasn't.
@VanessaSelbst @jvfricke I unretweeted, that wasn't my intent. Thought it was making light of a real 2017 situation. Have you listened to Jordan Peterson before?
@VanessaSelbst @jvfricke I just saw it, chuckled, thought it was deliberately made terribly, and rted.
@VanessaSelbst Have you ever played Guess Who? You have to ask if it's a man or a woman
@martymath @DarryllFish @ElloviSkin Sure but every other one is an absolute threat, whereas AI it's a worst case scenario. Will have plenty of benefits before we are enslaved 🙃
@Charnizard Pizzeria Mozza duhhh

Almost went back to back at #FYB HOU yesterday but lost in top 4. As usual thanks @mgcthetraveling. These are great events! @wizards_magic
@dreaaathomas @KevinRobMartin 🤷🏻‍♂️
@KevinRobMartin lose lose lose😭😭😭WINNN!!!🕺🏻🔥🎉#daysavers
@Joeingram1 @FarazJaka @plenopads @partypoker @joaosimaobh Agreed 👌
@FarazJaka @plenopads @partypoker @joaosimaobh Seemed like no ill will behind that part of it but publicly attacking Assassinato was def #OOL. Let @Joeingram1 be the judge
@plenopads @FarazJaka @partypoker @joaosimaobh Lol cmon Faraz. Clearly a joke. Poker is all about generalizations anyways. It's not even derogatory
@plenopads This just seems catty on your end
@deray it's the truth. allows your body to run like the machine that it is. it's def complicated though. cc: @Daniel_Blum
@LindseyPelas do most of the work for them. "Which is better this or that?"

@JoeyWeissman @Daniel_Blum More time investment, larger network, people give themselves more reasons to live. Feels like more is lost
@barbagger @quitti33 @Kevmath Suspend some disbelief. It's still a movie
@JoeyWeissman Exactly. This is what I mean. Thanks for the reminder. 👌
Social media is so important and yet so irrelevant. Put your phone down, live your life. But also, nahhh
@AwesomeANTJAY Hayyy 👋
@Charnizard "Be humble, sit down" 😂
@barbagger @quitti33 @Kevmath Not kidding. Amazing movie. Best action movie I've seen in years
@Charnizard @BillyKennyMusic Billy Kenny, Camelphat, Solardo, Skream, Tchami, Kink, Lane 8, Prydz, Maceo, Gorgon
@Kevmath If you haven't seen Baby Driver yet, it will be a good refresher course of Atlanta. Also see it because it's awesome
@iliza Amazing song. Elias my fave from them 👌

@Sofia_Lovgren @888poker omg heard so many great things about Swedish summer. Looks amazing!
Pretty impressive @CrownUpGuy somehow finds a way into the winners circle without even playing the event 😂
@VanessaSelbst @RealKidPoker agree. massive pot, think it through. still, i think blumstein was 3betting entire range there so more suited clubs than normal
These guys are wasting no time. I love it. Impossible call here though.
SO MUCH HEART
Amazing 😂 https://t.co/PKUBmtDYdO

@pressST4RT SOOO ORGANIC
Love it or hate it, the WSOP Main Event was fucking lit tonight 🔥🔥🔥
@smokrokflock Q10o
Def a triple range merge here
BUMP
@3kingme3 @haralabob Card distribution isn't really a thing with 40% of chips in play and 2x second. Def needs more VPIP but can't fault the man for making $$$
@robenyce @haralabob It's literally a troll from a Beth Shak hand circa 2007
@haralabob What the hell are you talking about?
Ott would have won! Lol
Omg Bry with the Beth Shak #dead😂😂😂😂
What the shit is this hand 😂
I love the way Bry flicks his cards over at showdown. #sosmooth

@pratyushbuddiga One of my all-time fave desserts
Always funny going to your crew's meeting spot every break of the Main and seeing it dwindle one by one like a Back To The Future picture.
Now that Mickey Craft is leaving the feature table can we please get Mickey Craft to the feature table.

18 players from the money, playing until then. Have 215k at 3k/6k. Been quite an unreal swingy day. Just happy to still be here.

I think cymbal guy just busted on a bad beat
45k into 2k/4K on dinner break 😭😭😭. Gonna need a lotta heat.
🤔 https://t.co/hRBOxQVQij
@AllAmericanDave classic breakfast off of @youngseth4 meal plan. Sub sweet pot hash, extra hot sauce packet. Table gold 45, seat 9, adam.
Had the under boat in a six-way pot. Luckily that was at my peak. 300k, first break.
@Michael_Laake @Lance_Bradley Yeah it's imprinted in my DNA pretty much at this point
Always great getting interviewed by one of the best, @Lance_Bradley. Note to self: stop saying like so much 😂 https://t.co/yPqhOJFMlB
Thought it was only 7 stacks over 200k+ but the 22k stack forgot a 0  so it's actually 8. I think avg is like 150 lol. Should be an 👆&amp;👇day.
@PokerNews @AuntyChardonnay should totally try doing the peanut butter baby vine
@indydunn78 @davidtuthill @LindseyPelas Yessss. I've gotten a few retweets/faves once or twice from her. We're all thirsty af. Guys, girls, cats, dogs
Goal for the day was 300k and won last pot to get to 301,200 💪💪💪
@davidtuthill Now you get to see all the girls your friends are thirsting for firsthand
@_tizzle Kept seeing it and then @DarryllFish said it was a TT rec
@AStern5 @RIVERIKK @espn @WSOP @livehighbry Yuppp talk to @livehighbry
250k @ 600/1200. Slow and steady thus far. Sparrow and Wolf for dinner break. Great spot. Good call @_tizzle
@Lance_Bradley Orange 183
220k to start the day, 213k 1st break, 215k this break. #chillin

@dwpoker @mtgworth Damn that's slick af. What's your DM coaching hourly rate? 😂
Asked how they met. Tinder, Bumble?? Girl was like eww no gross. Then said they met through IG DMs which apparently isn't gross lol
Sat next to a clear first date at breakfast where they got into a heated J Cole/Kendrick debate. They got past it--think it's gonna work.
Amazing 😂 https://t.co/hsFLKnSyr5
@Kevmath @WPT the most maximum security poker tournament i've ever played
@pokershares 8 days ago, never got the rate.
@Joeingram1 @onceharby lol 3.1k retweets
@Stapes Seriously!
@bebe_chien @RunGoodRussell @berkey11 @WSOP That's with all working urinals. And I counted 5 not working and then the break 2 debacle. So 3000/23=130. (130*45)/60=97. 17min added!
@bebe_chien @RunGoodRussell @berkey11 @WSOP Yeah let's do the math. 3000 dudes/28 urinals=107 rounds. Avg 45 secs per pee. 107*45=4815 seconds 4815/60 = 80 min for all men to pee.
@therugglesclub have 221k in he Main after day one ayyyyeee
Finished with 221k. Hit a lot of sets and got paid. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️Day 2 Wednesday.
