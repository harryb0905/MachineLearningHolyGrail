@lhochsteinmd do you feel that police target aa yes or no.
@lhochsteinmd I agree that's why I tell you All cops are not bad. Just the ass hole cops. It's a small number of assholes that f it up.
@lhochsteinmd I'm not shocked at all it's way more white people. It's not that the cops hurt them. It's that the cops don't get in trouble.
@lhochsteinmd I personally think it goes back way before that. But yes you are correct. Clinton voted it in. He also publicly apologized
@lhochsteinmd have you heard of mass incarceration of AA. Does it bother you that AA makeup 7% of Americans and 50% of the prison pop.
@lhochsteinmd I haven't seen any videos of cops doing the things to whites people like I do to black peoples.
@lhochsteinmd that's not true at all. I don't know hate cops. I dislike crooked cops who hate black people.

@BigBabyJonathan my teammates
@joshSD619 @Judson1360 I haven't had a drink in a year.
@eddie_619 in my mind I was happy to support the charges since I live in La I thought people route for the team not the city
@bigyettisd you mad bro. My address is A-105, Beverly Connection, 100 N La Cienega Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90048
@AndrewBrecken @SDDOUG1990 so that means you have a price.
@MJ54 thanks MJ

@kikotaitague23 It's my page I'm retired I can say what I want. If someone is mad they don't have to follow.
@KeepChargers if it's not hate don't use the word.
@juniorschargers he's my friend but I wasn't happy. I wasn't happy with myself either.
@DylanJohnSeaton what is
@DannyMedina85 you should look up my stats when he left maybe you will understand
@DurrikNurrisPls lol that was funny
@gileric the same voice I have now. You think I couldn't get a job.
@bigyettisd I'm the loser but you are following me and putting negativity on my page lol fat boy
@joshSD619 @Judson1360 yea right I don't owe anyone anything.
@MJ54 @ShareeceWright preach
@robbie_charles no thanks I only know how to count.
@MJ54 I support the chargers what else should I do.
@NickLee51 I can say what I want it's my page.
@alliieee26 exactly just because they are not in LA they are still the chargers.
@tristan_farida respect and support is earned.  I put my life on the line for the team and city how much more can I do.
@KeepChargers @Judson1360 so you think I asked to go to Denver.
@Jim1360 you are tough and amazing.
Maybe I'm not being clear I love SD charger fans,team,and city. I'm excited that they are coming to LA so now I can go support them again.
@RobScanlan I'm not bashing anyone if someone talks shit to you what do you do.
@joshSD619 sounding like me kicking them down and kicking them Down are different.
@KeepChargers what has LA done to you. If you have hate in your heart I feel so sorry for you.
@thekeptfaith I'm confused
@kikotaitague23 I would never I'm a big fan of SD
@m_wigi02 but I'm the bad guy
@Zach_Wolfe I love you
@Wardinski619 @Judson1360 why would I look for a job. I never have to work again.
@joshSD619 @Judson1360 I was paid well for a water boy.
@bigyettisd dad bod did I spell that correct.
@gileric I'm not a free agent I'm retired it's different
@bigyettisd I can count that's what's most important.
@kevin_tugg @drewstork he's not my daddy but spelling isn't my strong subject but I have others.
@KrHarmon @RealZakDarman I enjoy having fun with people that just like attention. It's 5 min of laughs for me.

@KeepChargers @Judson1360 yes I am washed up that's why I retired. What did you want me to keep playing until I couldn't walk
@TeeOhEmm why would I grow up I like being a kid.
@JohnnySilva619 if you want some attention fine I will give you some undergrad PUrdue and grad school university of Miami what about you
@num1_chargerfan no one said you were ignorant I said people are ignorant.
Wtf is the problem I love SD and the fans. I said I'm supporting the La chargers and now I'm a bad guy.
@tristan_farida I don't dislike SD in any way. How could I hate SD it's an amazing place why would you think I didn't.
@joshSD619 I'm not putting SD fans down. I'm just defending myself because people are mad because I said I like the La chargers. I love SD
@SocalKody @kikotaitague23 I thought I chose to retire after 11 years. And decided to finish my masters. My life is good

@kikotaitague23 I wouldn't want to. That's your job
@KHooper8 thanks.
@sely858 well don't follow me.
People are so ignorant I say I'm an LA charger fan they get mad. I'm a charger fan first to bad your city couldn't keep the team it's not me
@drewstork considering I'm second all time. I must have done a lot of cleaning up. I'm a charger fan dummy no matter wear.

Back on grind mood homework all day until Monday night football comes on. I need to find some time to hit the gym.
Man I like that safety from Clemson he's 65" and aggressive.
How could a person not love football. In not sure what I like more the violence of the game or the competition.
I'm sure most of you have vision boards already,if you don't I highly recommend that you start one now. Hopefully I just inspired one of you
Goodnight people for some reason I feel like watching home improvement. Tim the tool man Taylor was the man.
It pisses me off when parents are fighting at a youth football game. Give it up bro your hoop dreams are over. Don't live through ur kids.
People watching in the airport has to be one of the most interesting things in the world. It's characters everywhere.
I hate when people message me while I'm at the nail salon. They always ask what I'm doing,but I never wanna say getting my nails done.
It's amazing g to see woman drive and put on make up. You do know it's ok to wake up 10 min early.
Finally able to come up for air,I been in the lab all day. Managerial accounting has consumed my life. MBA coming soon.
@DAButler56 I remember when were friends.
@zanelackey how are you.
@UTKevinAcee I know a guy they can call
Should I watch furious 7 or the imitation game?
Lately I feel that I have so much love to give, with the exception of a few ugly people.  But I'm turning over a new leaf and loving more.
I feel like ugly people always have the the most to say.
@luxelabs what's the problem
@AydaKash I can help
