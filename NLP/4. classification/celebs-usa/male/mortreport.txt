@CaptJamesee The Combine is a vital platform, event and resource for all 32 teams, more-so than it is for players. And the on-field drills and testing is just a portion of the process.
@Robert_Freeman_ If I thought it was truly for punitive reasons, that would be one thing and then there‚Äôs still a discussion. The motive is PR no  matter how they spin it.
@ryanjennings305 See my reply below
@Robert_Freeman_ They‚Äôre not employed yet. It‚Äôs an interview - a gathering of information, a pretty confrontational process to answer tough questions, psychological testing, medical exams, drug testing. These players aren‚Äôt treated to a banquet. They don‚Äôt sleep much.  Teams will do work anyway.
Pretty difficult to find anybody in personnel or coaching who think  NFL‚Äôs policy to ban players w off-field history from Scouting Combine has any logic. NFL acts like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù to get invite. Do homework. It‚Äôs a massive, intense job interview. Nothing but a PR move.
Joe Flacco has been the underrated available QB this off-season, IMO, with this caveat: Durability. That's a fairly significant caveat. Compensation will be interesting. https://t.co/T9H0lqPpvX

Complications? We will discuss on @SportsCenter shortly and later on NFL Live. Remember this: Judgment calls currently not reviewable. Non-calls on judgment plays are dicey. There are no coaching challenges in final two minutes of each half and OT....and more issues.

@DaveyRohan Yes, obviously it's just one metric. Good evaluators look at everything and still project. QBs still need the physical gifts, the football aptitude, ability to process, mental toughness to go through the bumps that always come. Sam Darnold and Josh Allen are going to succeed.
Below 1,200 college snaps:  EJ Manuel   1,195 Mike Glennon 1,181 Blake Bortles  1,088 Ryan Tannehill  1,067 CJ Beathard  1,006 Jameis Winston 996 Sam Darnold  983 DeShone Kizer  961 Josh Allen  889 Brock Osweiler  817 Mitchell Trubisky 693
Between 1,200 and 1,500 college snaps:  Paxton Lynch 1,494 (not on NFL roster) Teddy Bridgewater 1,368 Josh Rosen 1,279 Andrew Luck 1,229 Johnny Manziel  1,209
@WolfpackCasey The list is "recent" QBs
For comparison sake, college starter snaps, above 1,500 club: Russell Wilson: 1,934 Baker Mayfield: 1,902 Derek Carr: 1,780 Jared Goff: 1,741 Lamar Jackson: 1,741 Dak Prescott: 1,710 Patrick Mahomes: 1,648 Deshaun Watson: 1,642 Carson Wentz: 1,555 Marcus Mariota: 1,506
Now the evaluations will begin in earnest. Haskins has lot of the goods. Early assessment is that he's not necessarily a plug and play - just one full year of starting at Ohio State and 917 career snaps but, yes, probably top-ranked QB of this year's NFL draft class. https://t.co/C2GdFy7eEv

Jaguars not trading for QB, which includes Eli, as much love as EVP Tom Coughlin has for him. Jags believe debut of Carlos Hyde, eventual return of Fournette, gives them "hammer" RBs they need for QBs, defense and injury-riddled O-line, which still needs somewhat mobile QB.
From @dallascowboys high-ranking source on Amari Cooper: "He's a younger veteran receiver - only 24 tears old - who can do lot of things in our offense and we don't have to wait for him to learn how to play in NFL."
When I mentioned Derek Carr, Gruden was quick and to the point: "We're not trading anyone else. We're trying to stay competitive and figure out a way to compete this next game (against the Colts." #Raiders
Jon Gruden on Amari Cooper deal: ""I hate to see good players go.. I was on the practice field when Reggie came to me and said Cowboys would do this for a No. 1 and I said let's do it. We now have five No. 1 picks in the next two years so I'm excited about that."

What a success story @thejaylonsmith has turned out to be for Cowboys. Lot of teams wouldn't even him touch him because of the catastrophic bowl game dislocated knee injury. Credit many. One is Cowboys head physician Dr. Dan Cooper who advised Smith would eventually heal.
Beckham did slip in "it's all of us" on assessing Giants offense but that's what it felt like, a slip-in. The Giants aren't the Rams. Who is right now? The O-line isn't close to the Rams and Panthers' front 7 can be a force.
As far OBJ telling @JosinaAnderson he's not getting 20 targets like other guys, only two players in NFL have had 20 targets in a game since 2016 - Beckham (once) and Alvin Kamara (once). His tone and body language wasn't bad but words won't look good in print.
Odell Beckham Jr. says he's "not a fan of the cold," mentions L.A. (who doesn't?). Our HOF WR @RandyMoss calls OBJ's words "bad," especially after getting the big bucks.
@ZigFracassi Again, the "playing time refernce" needs to be clarified. If there's an injury, the backup plays. Nobody wants to see Josh Allen hurt but he's a physical QB who's been hit plenty in their offense.

The man, @johnelway, recovering from that shoulder surgery https://t.co/8jr0tWCQW7
The @Ravens not only welcome back top draft pick TE Hayden Hurst, they have 4 TEs active today. More creativity for offense and occasional help with @Browns DE Myles Garrett
Cool move: @Ravens DC Don "Wink" Martindale said he won't be the guy to break CB Brandon Carr ("The Iron Man") starting streak of 164 games, despite Jimmy Smith's return. So Carr will start for sure, whether it's at Smith's start or part of nickel package to open game.
Patrick Mahomes doesn't play much under center. where some fumbles happen at snap in rain. Mahomes had just four snaps under center at Texas Tech (1,344 out of 1,348). For KC, only 43 of 249 snaps under center but only 10 pass attempts on those 43, per our @EpKap
There's hardly a test Patrick Mahomes hasn't passed in his five career starts, four this season but if the forecast remains true for a downpour of rain, That's another test for the young QB - some inclement weather teams worried about the ol' hand size pre-draft 2017
A little more on Derek Anderson as a forthcoming backup to Allen https://t.co/406BKAUGmJ
To clarify, "playing time" is not to be ruled out in case of injury. If you're eventually the backup, you have to be ready to play. https://t.co/hZmhYgLQYL
Derek Anderson was sitting out but the Bills have been among a handful of teams kicking tires on quarterbacks , including Landry Jones and Paxton Lynch. The experience and familiarity with coach and GM has tilted in favor of Anderson.
Veteran QB Derek Anderson, who served a backup and mentor during Cam Newton's first seven years in the NFL, now expects to sign with the @Bills within 24 hours to provide rookie Josh Allen in a similar role, perhaps even with playing time, per sources.

Thomas' unhappiness is simple: Seahawks have taken hard-line stance on new deal since Feb. The franchise has prioritized contracts for DE Frank Clark &amp; WR/KR Tyler Lockett (done). Thomas in last season of 4-year $40 million deal, his second contract since he was a 1st rd pick.
The Seahawks are considering a significant fine to Earl Thomas for conduct detrimental for twice missing practice. No final decision made. He's expected to play vs. Cowboys AND the Chiefs have emerged as a possible trade partner if Thomas is dealt this year, per sources.

The Falcons absence of LB Deion Jones and S Keanu Neal hurts - Jones especially did a great job in space for a team that faces dual RB threats Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara twice in NFC South, not to mention maybe Le'Veon Bell in week 5 and Saquon Barkley in week 7
I wanted to clarify with Tyreek Hill that indeed he is "Ty" to family and friends but his PREFERRED name is the fastest animal in God's creation, the cheetah, thus his Twitter handle @cheetah. Who's to argue with the fastest man in the NFL?
The man behind @CaptAndrewLuck, one of the great follows on Twitter https://t.co/TP2B0nG9cI
With Josh Gordon out of Browns offense, there's Jarvis Landry and TE David Njoku as primary targets for Tyrod Taylor BUT another under-the-radar rookie WR is Damion Ratley, a 6th-round pick from Texas A&amp;M. Active today.
LeSean McCoy, one of Allen's most vocal supporters, will be center of @Bills offense but OC Brian Daboll figures use Allen's unique athleticism to help create more space for Shady.
Josh Allen has great admiration for Phillip Rivers but fact he wears jersey no. 17 is "just a coincidence." Another fact: Bills players are excited Allen is QB even w rough spots. He will miss fellow rookie, WR Ray-Ray McCloud, for a week due to injury. Good chemistry there.
Is this Nick Foles' last start? Carson Wentz is on track to return next Sunday vs. Colts but still awaits medical clearance, as @AdamSchefter just reported on Sunday NFL Countdown #espn
With Darren Sproles inactive, Wendell Smallwood gets a role with but plan always has been for Jay Ajayi to get more of a load and Corey Clement with some touches, too, vs. Bucs
Aaron Rodgers is active for Packers, helps that Davante Adams is active...and Marcus Mariota is active for Titans
Jadeveon Clowney is not playing today after pre-game workout, as reported by NFL media, because of a strain on side of torso that had him listed as questionable - not serious but no-go today for @HoustonTexans .
Jaguars would play Fournette if it was final game of year but they play Titans next week, a team that beat them twice last year in AFC South.
Jaguars RB Leonard Fournette remains unlikely to play but he'll test hamstring around noon ET. He hit 17-to-18 mph running this week but did feel a little grab in hamstring. If he feels it again in workout, he'll be out, as expected.
Josh Gordon's pending release is inclusive or present and past issues, a team official said. He reported to team facility this morning  w/ hamstring issue after practicing all week. Trust and other mitigating factors were cited. There is no convenience for anyone on this action

Wednesday's top stories checklist : Aaron Rodgers' knee Nick Foles, one more start - once Eagles coach Doug Pederson announces Bills' rookie QB Josh Allen gets first start (awaiting Sean McDermott) Joey Bosa's second opinion on foot injury Le'Veon Bell's continued absence
A year ago, heard lot of coaches and personnel people say the Bears didn't have a single receiver that would make most rosters. GM Ryan Pace has given his new coach and his QB all the toys they need. O-line already was solid.
For all the understandable attention on return and health of @Texans defenders JJ Watt, Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus, under-the-radar player to watch is new Texans' S Tyrann Matthieu. Where will DC Romeo Crennel deploy Honey Badger vs. @Patriots?
Royce Freeman is first rookie to start at RB for @Broncos since future HOF'er Terrell Davis in 1995. The team believes his "comparable" may be KC's Kareem Hunt, another 3rd round pick from last year who led NFL in rushing. Davis was a 6th rd pick in '95.
James Conner is not Le'Veon Bell but he has converted 11 percent of his body fat to lean muscle (remember he's less than 3 years removed from cancer) and he has grown mentally in passing game enough that he has earned Big Ben's trust. #Steelers
Brandon Marshall, 34, expected to be active today in Denver, where he started career. He's had six 100-catch seasons but now he has specialty role to give Russell Wilson some of those move-the-chain &amp; red zone targets that went to Jimmy Graham.
The plan for Browns WR Josh Gordon has been roughly 20 snaps, give or take, but enough to do damage.
There is much more optimism inside Eagles organization that Carson Wentz's return is coming sooner than later. Not ruled out this week but week 3 sounds more realistic. His GPS data has hit a vital threshold - ability to protect himself. Only a setback would cool optimism.
As we talked about on Sunday NFL Countdown, Lamar Jackson will be the active No. 2 QB behind Joe Flacco for Ravens with a package of QB plays. Robert Griffin III not expected to be active but he is the safety net for 2018 if Flacco is lost for any stretch.
Great TD throw, @JalenHurts

Carson Wentz has been given the green light to resume 11-on-11 team work when the @Eagles return to practice Sunday. Not a surprising but encouraging development.

And Matthews' contract got done this morning, as @AdamSchefter reported, with a 5-year $75 million deal.
The Falcons' consider this salary-cap neutral adjustment and can stick w/ plans to work on new deals for LT Jake Matthews and DT Grady Jarrett.
The Falcons' assurance to hold good-faith negotiations on a new contract in 2019 also was a catalyst to putting aside Jones' plans to sit out. https://t.co/Qvo06w9tRn
Julio Jones' revised deal will net him an additional $2.9 million in '18. He received a $4.4 million signing bonus and lowered his base salary from $10.5 million to $9 million, per sources Bottom line: Jones will make $13.4 million instead of $10.5 million this season.
Saints coaches Sean Payton, Dennis Allen &amp; Dan Campbell who have worked with Tony Sparano are among those in NFL that have personally called time out from training camp to make the trip for Sparano's memorial services this afternoon. Many others coming in.
It may sound corny to some but Falcons owner Arthur Blank preaches the ‚ÄúBrotherhood‚Äù theme for resolving differences. Let‚Äôs see if it happens. https://t.co/7v5sjf7STE
Julio Jones &amp; the Falcons are working intensively to resolve their contract differences, hoping to avoid Jones‚Äô planned training camp holdout. The sides are focused on creatively addressing Jones‚Äô ability to earn more than his $10.5 milllion base in ‚Äò18. Hopeful but not done yet

Eagles have other PUP candidates but not Wentz. That‚Äôs been the case for awhile and nothing has changed https://t.co/bbMDfXW1rA
The Eagles plan for Carson Wentz from day 1 of camp is for him to do individual and 7 on 7 drills, monitor progress and determine later with medical staff when it‚Äôs appropriate to do full team work. You can‚Äôt do any of that on PUP.
üôè https://t.co/PX88Lr43df
Actually, the Falcons position is they will negotiate an extension until Julio has 2 years left. He has 3 years left but both sides still want to resolve the gap in some creative way. https://t.co/UcPayqBpjA
Josh Allen has signed his contract with the @buffalobills, according to sources.
The obvious reaction on @RamsNFL ' contract agreement with Todd Gurley and Brandin Cooks before that is what about Aaron Donald? Fair reaction but Donald's deal will be in different stratosphere in real money and guarantees.
Nick Saban joins us next on NFL Live to discuss some of his former players, including Julio Jones and, yes, @LouisRiddick... as well as @AlabamaFTBL ... plus more from @SandoESPN on QB rankings
A few minutes away from NFL Live with @LRiddickESPN @tthasselbeck @WendiNix_ESPN with discussion re: @SandoESPN's in-depth QB rankings based on poll of 50 NFL GMs/coaches...and some news on @ESPNNFL
Julio Jones' $47 million in guarantees was paid out in first three years of his extension at a fair market value of almost $16m per year. He has three years left at $10.5m, $12.5m and $11.4m but annual salary not guaranteed until week 1 as vested veteran. https://t.co/v0asTdPzw1
Julio Jones does not plan to report to Falcons on schedule Thursday without an adjustment to his contract, which has three years remaining, per league sources. He is set to make $10.5 million in 2018. The team is aware of his mindset at this time.

@ClevelandBro_ns I‚Äôd be a hypocrite to really answer. I do believe that Browns have a core group of excellent personnel men, GM John Dorsey worked butt off to build consensus and he has signed his name to it.

Browns consultant Scot McCloughan was SEA Sr. personnel ecxec when they drafted R. Wilson. @SethWickersham article- Wilson report read- "Obviously we are really interested in passers with better height, but this guy may just be the exception to the rule. He has the 'it' factor."
While evaluating Mayfield and all the Oklahoma talent, NFL evaluators thoroughly praised the creativity of Head Coach/Play Caller Lincoln Riley. Oklahoma has become one of the top destinations for NFL coaches to learn from. Nearly all 32 teams have come through Norman to learn.
@igglesnut I believe he probably felt reaching a consensus and having that unity was important in light of recent years where it appeared dysfunction and disagreement reigned.
Just to clarify and correct, while Browns GM John Dorsey has known who he would pick about 6 weeks ago, he still wanted an al-inclusive process for organizational unity. He didn't formally reveal it with owners Jimmy &amp; Dee Haslam until this week, per team sources.

@pizzamon1 Even majority of tackles need help vs. elite edge rushers. Many top defensive linemen in NFL today are interior (think Aaron Donald, Fletcher Cox among a slew of others). QBs hate pocket collapses, not to mention impact on run game. Nelson is different dude.
Don't know a coach who doesn't want Quenton Nelson on their team. Only one gets him. https://t.co/uzA0A8D3GB
@thetylerconti I hope you're right, with the exception of the "clowns" part üòÇ
All of a sudden, it feels like Alabama's Minkah Fitzpatrick is most underrated DB in NFL draft. Hopefully, that's a misread on my part. He is one of three or four best players. One proven evaluator not picking in top 10: Barkley, Nelson, Fitzpatrick and Chubb are the best.
@beardingfordays @billbarnwell Not at all. Kamara was/is great. Dalvin Cook was pretty good too before injury.
Of all the GM pre-draft pressers I have seen, Giants' Dave Gettleman was most entertaining and probably most transparent.
@billbarnwell Winning that award and being the best is not necessarily the measuring stick and is subjective. Kareem Hunt was NFL rushing leader. RGIII was Offensive ROY but most everyone knew a (healthy) Andrew Luck was better.
@billbarnwell But Kamara had Mark Ingram as lead complementary RB, Drew Brees as QB and Sean Payton as the play-caller, so not clear-cut on comparison to Fournette
Credit @ByKimberleyA for first reporting Marshall's release, which led to the confirmation during Gettleman's presser
Gettleman confirms team is releasing Brandon Marshall with "failed physical" designation
Gettleman on the idea that he has to take a QB with second pick because (theoretically) he'll never be there again: "Hogwash."
@themicknartin No way he would go to 2 to 12. Not his style to trade.
Giants GM Dave Gettleman on Saquon Barkley: "He's one of those guys my mother could have scouted."
It's what former Giants/Colts GM Ernie Accorsi has told me often and most recently @SI_PeterKing on his podcast - with QBs, don't grade on a curve. Don't make a "B" quarterback an "A." But, there are some really good evaluators who legitimately like some you may not. https://t.co/SwG1Y3puDj

@geoffschwartz Shurmur is solid with Eli Manning if there is a transition at some point. He attended Manning Passing Academy in June and got better acquainted w/ Eli and early glimpse at lot of college QBs who were there, including his son Kyle, the Vanderbilt QB.
Together again...best NFL highlights team ever! https://t.co/cZso1lni4I
They all do it. It's funny. https://t.co/sQU4fMw80h
@WINDOCTORRX The one thing you learn about Shurmur is he has worked in many environments and the experience under Zimmer is invaluable. Shurmur has a underrated presence. Let's say this: Zimmer sincerely does not want to lose him. That speaks volumes for teams.
No question Vikings OC Pat Shurmur checks a lot of boxes for Giants, as does Josh McDaniels. Shurmur has great pedigree, worked for Andy Reid, not too proud to grab a couple Chip Kelly concepts, has experienced demands of Mike Zimmer and never flinches with injuries/surprises.
Sam Bradford has his left knee cleaned out and a bone spur shaved on Nov. 7 by Dr. James Andrews. The knee has remained structurally sound but the pain is not nearly has acute as it was pre-surgery and post MNF season opener vs. Saints. But it's Case Keenum's game.
Unless something happens in pregame, Sam Bradford expected to be the No. 2 QB behind Case Keenum. Mike Zimmer has never had 3 QBs active so Teddy Bridgewater is aware of possibility he could be inactive.

Russ Ball, Packers VP of football administration, player personnel director Brian Gutenkunst and possibly director of football ops Eliot Wolf are expected to have re-defined duties as Thompson moves to another role, per sources.
Ted Thompson will not return as the GM of the Green Bay Packers but will remain with the team. The front office will go through a reorganization with team president Mark Murphy defining new roles for current members of front office, per league and team sources.

When Andrew Luck returns from from his European treatments soon, he will resume a throwing regimen that will ultimately determine whether he needs corrective surgery to his biceps tendon, per multiple sources.

@kvoy8 @AdamSchefter Never
@CplSimba_Gaming @metsfansince02 @YoungGodBilly @JonnyGG12 @ratsflanker @AdamSchefter Were you getting ready to play pro football?
@emcee8t Again, Dr. Andrews was not speaking specifically about Carson Wentz...and, yes, 9 months is the low end but careful on expectations that he will be absolutely ready for start of season. That's actually what I was thinking before Dr. Andrews cautioned me about misleading people
@Manny3322 9-to-12 months... 9 months still give Wentz a chance for start of 2018 but the point is to not rush it. He's a true franchise QB. Don't play until he's 100 percent ready.
Finally, Dr. Andrews said the danger of returning to football too early from ACL surgery is higher odds of tearing the graft repair; also places the healthy knee in jeopardy until rehab and healing are thoroughly accomplished.
Dr. Andrews said he's encountered too many football players w/ torn ACLs who have unrealistic expectation, citing Adrian Peterson's remarkable recovery from ACL/MCL repair in Dec '12 to play by Sept '13. Dr. Andrews reminded Peterson was genetically unique. Exception to rule
Dr. James Andrews, noted orthopedic specialist, was not speaking specifically to Wentz but he told me a short while ago that expectation should be tempered for a player with an ACL surgery to return by start of '18 season. He says ACL repairs need 9-to-12 months.
Carson Wentz will have his ACL surgery with "a couple of days," per a team source.
Aaron Rodgers had scans this morning but Mike McCarthy said evaluation is ongoing and no clear decision yet

Andy Reid giving up play-calling isn't a first. He's done it in the past on occasions with Brad Childress in Philadelphia and Doug Pederson in KC. As someone noted, the key is to see what happens after the first 15 scripted plays.
Alex Smith has had Reid's support all week but his performance against the Jets also will determine how short his leash gets with rookie Patrick Mahomes in waiting, the sources also say.
Chiefs coach Andy Reid is benching....himself. He has has planned to hand over play calling to OC Matt Nagy for today's game vs. Jets although Reid will continue to have oversight, per team sources.

Not surprised Packers coach Mike McCarthy is resolute on commitment to Brett Hundley and Joe Callahan as Aaron Rodgers undergoes surgery
Just to clarify: Bridgewater will practice Wed without coming off PUP but still has max 3 wk window to go on active roster or IR or release.
Obviously, Case Keenum will remain starter for at least this week and I suspect beyond...long time since Teddy B has played. This is process
Vikings will in fact take Teddy Bridgewater off PUP and plan for him to practice Wednesday.
No official comment yet from Vikings. Once Bridgewater is taken off PUP,  team has to decide after 3 weeks to make him active or go on IR.
Dr, Dan Cooper gave @teddyb_h2o the clearance this morning. Vikings now decide whether to take QB off PUP list which opens three-week window
Vikings QB Teddy Bridgewater has been cleared to practice by doctor who performed the surgery on his dislocated knee, according to source
This is cool https://t.co/UYAZdnlggl

Jones emphasized NFL game ops manual several times and then this: "You know who reminded me about the game ops policy? Donald Trump."
Jones didn't say that meant the two players would be disciplined (Garrett said they won't). JJ just wants clarity for them going forward.
Moore &amp; Irving were serving suspensions. Jones said he's giving thought to their actions because "they were cutting it close" post-anthem
When asked about Demontre Moore &amp; David Irving raising a fists after anthem ended Sunday, Jones noted they weren't in AZ when issue was hot
Jones: "My job is the Dallas Cowboys. It's in the best interests of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL and the players ...to honor the flag."
Jones adamant the policy is in best interest of players, who "need consequences" to stand up to peer pressure
Jones: "I've always had our players' backs on issues I've been criticized for"- understands social concerns but no compromise on anthem
Jones said VP Pence's actions and statement in Indianapolis Sunday generated new questions that he decided to answer post-game.
Jones said he thought controversy would "go away" after MNF in AZ when team knelt "in unity" before anthem and then stood locked arm in arm
Jones said the policy is not new; made Jason Garrett aware last year after observing some players on other teams sit or kneel during anthem
Jerry Jones: There will be no exceptions to workplace policy he expressed Sunday evening - disrespect anthem &amp; flag and players won't play.
Jerry Jones cited this in phone conversation short time ago...will post more of his thoughts https://t.co/qbAEbjOsAH

John Fox very involved in #Bears draft process w Mitch Trubisky. Decision crystallized for GM R. Pace as scenarios played out early eve.
Not to overkill the point but never witnessed a scene at the #NFLDraft2017 like here https://t.co/DJ23yFPFwJ
Steelers gotta be thinking about those Kevin Greene days.
Texans are a QB away from being championship team, young nucleus and now @DeshaunWatson4 to eventually lead them. #NFLDraft2017 https://t.co/Dqrqh4dALp
DeShaun Watson's last visit w Texans. Looked Bill O'Brien in eye, said knows most important piece to championship team is HC-QB relationship
Patrick Mahomes has drawn comparison to Brett Favre. Andy Reid was in GB as was Chiefs GM John Dorsey when Favre was a young stallion.
Chiefs have traded their 1 and 3 and 1 next year for the Bills 10 spot #NFLDraft2017
Last time Coughlin took a RB in top 10 was Fred Taylor, who became Jaguars' all-time rushing leader. #NFLDraft2017
Tom Coughlin wanted to help Blake Bortles with run game, play-action for explosive pass plays, improve team toughness. #NFLDraft2017

Historical pre-draft cliche on dynamic defensive linemen is "takes plays off." GM: "Such BS. In an era of 90-100 plays, even bigger BS."

,@C_hermz Everyone understands concept of increasing odds with more picks, but it's still something Browns must prove in player  selection
Browns' stockpiling draft picks compared to models used by Jimmy Johnson &amp; Bill Belichick but do they similar talent evaluators?

Money talks: Calais Campbell expected to take Jaguars deal with average of just under $15 million after seriously thinking Broncos at $13m
Now getting some backpedal on Siemian/Jets/Bromcos talk. But Romo as a trade rather than release is still alive.
Jets would like to deal for Siemian but will look hard at Jay Cutler if no trade with Denver.
Cowboys now expect to trade Tony Romo to Broncos or Texans, sources say. Broncos talking with Jets about Trevor Siemian.
Calais Campbell could take less money ($13 million per year) to go "home" to Denver; Jaguars offering more than $14m. Interesting decision.
Kirk Cousins appealed personally to owner Dan Snyder for a trade but was basically told not to get his hopes up, per sources.
Sean Payton said it will take a lot to get Brandin Cooks. Sources say they still want quality defensive starter, plus draft picks over 2 yrs
As expected, Eagles announce they have released Connor Barwin
With an additional $2.5 million injury guarantee in first year, @awhitworth77 will make $15 million with @RamsNFL in 2017.
Whitworth will get $12.5 guaranteed in first year on 3-year, $33 million deal to become Jared Goff's blindside protector, per source. https://t.co/sIqyR00TtO
Here we go again... https://t.co/cGnP09HyRg
Joe Mixon may be most talked-about player in this draft, especially as it draws near. https://t.co/ZAfvNO7CD1
That's 5 rings each (NFL &amp; college)....and to think the Browns had 'em both at one time. #sorry #cheapshot https://t.co/JBKEExIc5x
Down OT draft increases leverage for veteran UFAs. Wagner will get his. Interesting one is LT Andrew Whitworth, 35 but still going strong. https://t.co/9XHy8hQ5qt
Garcon will be 31 in August but logical fit for Kyle Shanahan, OC during best yr in '13 (113 for 1,346 yds); physical, blocks in run game.
When Pierre Garcon finalizes deal with 49ers, as expected, league sources believe he will make $16 million in first year.
Wise move by Gresham, considering veteran TE market and quality/depth of the draft at the position. https://t.co/k24LwpZOHq
D.J. Fluker (@djthewarrior76) may not have lived up to lofty first-round draft status but his largesse includes big heart. Great team guy.
Surprise for some, not for others - Glennon has some strong support within NFL, from coaches to players as we near free agency. https://t.co/z5exYwPHSM

After running 4.51 and 4.52  in the 40, Leonard Fournette has no need to run at LSU Pro Day, even without "water weight" of 240. #GameOver
Fournette's first 40 is an unofficial 4.51. That's pretty good at 240.
Yes on McCoy but he ran 4.48 &amp; had excellent 20-yd shuttle and 60-yd cone drill at Pro Day. Fournette's tape is still his best resume, yes. https://t.co/sKDj2H2DRm
He's great! üòÇ https://t.co/7eDIfDfymi
He wasn't terrible when healthy and fully engaged - just makes one wonder what's going on with Fournette. https://t.co/xLh8AjSC6h
Leonard Fournette showing up at 240 lbs, then having a weak 28.5 inch vertical jump are more red flags after a season with injuries.
I've heard Jonathan Allen was special even beyond football. This is good. https://t.co/GTk1oBZ0Au
Good note/reminder from @MoveTheSticks  - Florida OT David Sharpe was late off snap of ball because he was legally blind in right eye

Eagles working out QBs - such as Tebow - should never be connected to Bradford rumors. Matt Barkley can be had for late draft pick, though.

DeMarco Murray should now be in Philly. Still wants to visit before physical then sign new deal.
Murray's obstacle with the Eagles would remain obvious; as Kelly noted in press conference, he's not going to overpay anyone.
DeMarco Murray renewed Eagles' interest w personal call to Chip Kelly; not just spread offense ran at Oklahoma; Sam Bradford's roommate, too

@johnelway says he did tell Peyton the Broncos definitely  want him back but to take time, like 4 or 5 weeks, and they can touch base again.
As Jack Del Rio interviews in Oakland today, many Raiders still strongly support Tony Sparano after experiencing his leadership
RT @warriorsgbb: Any chance the Seahawks lose Tom Cable? &gt;&gt; Cable has interviewed outstanding. Seahawks believe he is unjustly ignored.

Rick Smith will handle Dan Quinn negotiations, not Mike Tannenbaum. Jets say they never complained to NFL about potential conflict #ok.  .
Jim Schwartz could become one of the highly-valued free agent defensive coordinators if Bills let him out. May not be a match between them.
Mike Tannebaum assumes 'Fins VP of FB Ops job on Feb. 1 - Super Bowl Sunday. Quinn very well could be coaching that day.
Jets voiced concerns to NFL re: Seahawks DC Dan Quinn still repped by former GM Mike Tannenbaum, recently named Dolphins VP of FB Ops
Falcons once offered HC job to Jason Garrett, who will be free agent when Dallas season ends. Multiple Cowboys asst coach contracts also up.
If Doug Marrone does not land a head coach job, sources say he will have an offer to join close friend Bill O'Brien as a Texans consultant

Asked about how long he will play, Manning said he liked Tom Brady's answer yesterday about playing "until he sucks" Good laugh.
Manning says he can't say he was shocked about Welker's suspension because he had an idea of what was going on.
Peyton Manning says "a lot of people" have to step up to compensate for Welker's absence, including himself and DeMarcus Ware, not just WRs
,@all_biz When to the #warroomleague power rankings go public? My team has to be in top 16.
Oh, Texans made it an even $100 million with $51.8 million guaranteed for JJ Watt, who was set to make $1.9 million this year, per source
Watt becomes NFL's highest paid def player, surpassing 6-year, $96-mill Bills gave ex-Texan Mario Williams, who got $50 mill guaranteed
JJ Watt's new extension in range of jersey number plus zeroes - $99 million over 6 years, including $51 million guaranteed, per sources

Rams 11 draft picks. Used late 7th on Sam; felt most undrafted FA would be reluctant to sign. Yet undrafted FA Ethan Westbrooks beat him out
Fisher said cutting Sam was not a difficult decision. Cited roster strength; noted a 6th rounder &amp; all four 7th rounders did not make cut
Fisher says there are no challenges if Sam gets a second opportunity somewhere else. "He just kept his head down and work." Praised "motor."
Fisher: "I was pulling for him. It just didn't work out."
Listening to Jeff Fisher, I would say Michael Sam is not guaranteed a practice squad spot because of other position needs.

Aldon Smith's 9 game suspension was unique combination of substance abuse and personal conduct policies. Can return to team Nov 10
Yes, league has officially announced.
Aldon Smith suspended nine games on personal conduct policy, per sources
Don't be surprised if you see or hear Peyton Manning is throwing passes to Wes Welker before Dallas game. They did pitch-and-catch Wed.
Officially Manning's taunting fine is $8,268, per league's fine schedule for unsportsmanlike conduct. #moneywellspent.
Peyton Manning notified by NFL he is fined $8,200 for taunting of DJ Swearinger. No appeal. Peyton: "I accept it. Money well spent."

Under NFL fine sked, Jimmy Graham facing $33,075 for 2 dunks - his dunk vs. Atl caused 23 minute goalpost delay in '13 #JimmyGrahamRule
Asked Jaguars staff before Thurs night game if there was a legit rookie sleeper. Yes, WR Allen Hurns, (undrafted, Miami), 4 for 74 yards.
Sources: Manziel tardiness handled internally http://t.co/XYaQGhVvXD via @espnnfl
‚Äú@Nick_Gapinski: who do you think did the best out of Bortles, Bridgewater or Manziel?‚Äù &gt; Same order as draft: Bortles, Manziel, Bridgewater
Manziel did learn sliding head first is not such a good idea but his 16 yard scramble with traditional slide was ideal. Solid first outing
Saw @AntonioPierce impressed w @JManziel2; says Manziel could teach QBs on how to slide. Manziel played baseball. Padres drafted in 28th rd
Hoyer was better than 6-of-14 passing stats, especially on 3rd drive. Two big drops. Protection was great. #Browns
, @grinder881 Yes, Falcons-Lions kickoff on Oct 26 is 9:30 am ET or 1:30 pm in London, site of game

‚Äú@FortWorthJoe:  Hoyer is the Orton to Manziel's Tebow. He has no chance with the fans.‚Äù &gt;&gt; True but Manziel QB skills are superior than TT
,@Rob41207 I don't think Manziel would say I've been a supporter. I've called him reckless on/off field but it's evident he's made progress
Hoyer manages huddle &amp; clock better but he should; Manziel had TD dropped; another TD ruled inco would've been reversed on replay. #browns
‚Äú@browne66:  Did u watch the same scrimmage @TonyGrossi was tweeting about?‚Äù &gt;&gt; I have talked to people in loop, too.
‚Äú@BCIZsports:  How'd you like the University of Akron?‚Äù &gt;&gt; excellent facility for Zips. Good to see Coach @TerryBowden #brownsscrimmage
Watched Browns scrimmage today. Just a scrimmage but easy to see Manziel is closing gap &amp; will start getting some one reps next week.
‚Äú@AdamSchefter: Just got this text from Rams' practice: "Aaron Donald is unreal."‚Äù &gt;&gt; Got a feeling many teams will regret passing on him
, @ChadGutzman I thought that could happen (adjusted contract). I don't think there's a chance of that now. #Lyncholdout
,@craigjackson422 Team garnishes wages when season begins on pro-rated basis until full amount satisfied. Yes, that has happened
That calculation, per CBA, based on $30,000 daily fine &amp; penalty equal to weekly base salary of $294,117 for each missed preseason game
That's not counting what Lynch would lose if he misses first 11 camp days and preseason opener Aug. 7 - tab a whopping $624,117...(c'td)
If Seahawks take hard line - I believe they will - and Lynch misses first 6 camp days, portion of $6 mill sign bonus in jeopardy...(c'td)

Priceless segments now with Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine &amp; John Smoltz on @LeBatardShow on ESPN radio
,@FatManZan Suh entered NFL under old rookie pool. Franchise tender factors salary cap number; Lions restuctures kept pushing $ to back end
Ray Rice's additional game check fine docked from 2013 base salary of $1 million, not 2014 base of $4 million. That's $58,823 vs. $235,294
If Lions can't get Suh signed, his franchise tender would be $26.7 million in 2015 - or he becomes a unrestricted free agent in his prime
Lions are not optimistic about signing Ndamukong Suh to a new contract. He enters camp counting 22,412,500 against sal cap.

Eric Ebron #DETPick Multiple front office/coaches said it was Ebron &amp; the rest of the field at TE. Fits well in Joe Lombardi's system
Anthony Barr #MINPick Converted from RB. 23.5 sacks 9 FF past two years. Vikings 32nd in scoring defense last year. Lost J. Allen in FA
Justin Gilbert #CLEPick Draft plan was to get CB with ball skills to pair up opposite of Joe Haden. Ended up with that plus 2015 1st &amp; 4th
Mike Evans #TBPick worked with HOF WR James Lofton pre-combine. Lofton raved about Evans' work ethic, physical ability and coachabiity
#ATLPick Texas A&amp;M 2010 recruiting class. OT Luke Joeckel (2013 #2 overall) &amp; OT Jake Matthews (2014 #6 overall)
Jake Matthews #ATLPick Sr. Captain. Fits Dimitroff criteria 41 of 46 picks seniors. 23/46 captains. Matt Ryan sacked 44 times (career high)
Jaguars OC Jedd Fisch on Bortles- 'Strong, physical, big arm, can hang in there and take a hit! Prototype size &amp; can move pocket.
Buffalo LB Khalil Mack #OAKPick From two scholarship offers (Buffalo &amp; Liberty) to a top 5 pick. NCCA record 16 Forced Fumbles.
Reaction to Watkins coming to Buffalo RT @EJManuel3  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bills trade up to the  #4 pick. Selecting Sammy Watkins #BUFPick One GM I spoke to thoroughly believed he was the best player in this draft
People around the league saw an immense improvement in his mechanics at his pro day and in private workouts. Pre-Draft work with @JwPalms
Blake Bortles #JAXPick From 5 college offers (2 for TE) to the number 3 pick overall. First purchase is covering Brothers Ole Miss tuition
O-Line coach Paul Boudreau believes Robinson is the best O-Line prospect he's evaluated since Willie Roaf. (Was on 1993 Saints staff)
Greg Robinson #STLpick Rams Staff was very impressed with his private workout last Thursday. More impressed with classroom work.
Jadeveon Clowney to Houston. Flashback to the 2013 Outback Bowl for his #SCtop10 hit on Vincent Smith http://t.co/fyhuqKfGtJ
Falcons not trading to first pick. They moved on before draft commenced.
NFL Insiders with @AdamSchefter, @MelKiperESPN, @SuzyNFL32 from Radio City Music Hall at 3 ET, ESPN and WatchESPN
‚Äú@Rich_Campbell: Cutler on McCown: "My only regret is I wish I would have met him earlier in life." #Bears‚Äù &gt;&gt; high praise for Josh McCown
Would Chip Kelly would take Johnny Manziel if available? Mark me down for a "no" on that, not just because Eagles already have Nick Foles
If you're thinking Ottis Anderson w Parcells &amp; Giants, Anderson was 1st rd pick of Cardinals; Giants acquired for late-round picks
What Parcells didn't say on @MikeAndMike - he's never been real big on 1st round RBs. Curtis Martin &amp; Marion Barber among his 3rd rd picks
Another "surprise" QB team to watch: Bengals, even though there are needs at CB &amp; DL. Teddy Bridgewater is in discussion as fallback option
‚Äú@NFLDraftTalk365: they're without a 2nd this year‚Äù &gt;&gt; not if they trade back or they could stay at 23 &amp; take him, pending who's there
Count Chiefs as sleeper QB team, depending how 1st round falls. Andy Reid history, even if it's 2nd or 3rd rd. Carr among QBs linked.
Rams are working out numerous players now that visits to team facility are over.  Notre Dame, Ohio St, Tennessee  are among team's stops
Rams will work out a trio Texas A&amp;M players, including Johnny Manziel, Jake Matthews &amp; Mike Evans. Rams have 2 &amp; 13 picks in 1st rd.
Dr. Jack Ramsay died in his sleep at 89, according to family, via @MikeAndMike. Sad news. Great coach. Greater man. RIP.
NFL Insiders talk about 49ers, QBs, draft, LSU, Manning, etc., with @suzykolber @MarkdominikESPN &amp; the unstoppable @MelKiperESPN 3:30 ET
NFL Insiders with @SuzyNFL32 @McShay13 and @FieldYates on ESPN2 at 3:30 ET. Again, ESPN2
Significant flaw in CBA needs fixing for players' sake &gt;&gt; John Harbaugh not a fan of offseason rules http://t.co/9jVUTMQ4IZ
Redskins make official they have signed QB Colt McCoy
Miami OT Seantrel Henderson didn't help himself today  - "quit" his Pro Day workout halfway through it. No explanation yet. Disappointing.
Johnny Manziel will work out for the Browns in 2-3 weeks
Browns' busy QB workout docket this wk: Carr, Bridgewater, Bortles, Garoppolo (Eastern Illinois), Savage (Pitt) &amp; Wenning (Ball St)
On same day of @JManziel2 impressive NFL workout, the full hour of Manziel at Gruden's QB Camp is about to debut at 7 ET on ESPN.
MT ‚Äú@AkitaKid: any franchise whose decisions are swayed by a pro day is not a good franchise.‚Äù &gt; true but you don't ignore it.
Browns so tricky they bypassed another Pro Day at Texas A&amp;M. Ignoring every possible evaluation tool in a year of their most critical draft
, @samhlock Russell Wilson tremendous at self-preservation in-game, college and pro. Can Manziel really transform that way? Legit question
No question @JManziel2 aced Pro Day. He's coachable on fundamentals. Even 6-3 QBs must find passing windows. Can he play 20 games a year?
Johnny Manziel plans provide a little twist to his Pro Day for NFL eyes: He will wear helmet and shoulder pads when he throws.
‚Äú@ryanwaid: why only 5 ft? Is that enough?‚Äù &gt;&gt; they actually did engineering research for even lengthier extension but results not favorable
Extension of goal posts by 5 feet is one proposal that is expected to pass this morning before NFL owners meetings conclude
Our prayers remain fervent for Jim Kelly &amp; family @HJKforever, across country, across NFL, in the church.  John 14:27 #PrayersForJK
With compensatory picks in, 2014 NFL draft - Seven-round order http://t.co/tbkGK5kZ0s via @espnnfl
Broncos coach John Fox did say on ESPN Insiders the team has not closed door on return by Knowshon Moreno. Price must be right, obviously
Sanchez has been throwing &amp; is about "80 percent" recovered from his labrum surgery. Eagles will do their own medical eval before signing
Sanchez "failed physical" termination w Jets was protocol. Won't affect next step - signing with Eagles. He's on good recovery from surgery
NFL Insiders now on ESPN (and ESPN Watch) at 3:30 ET from league meetings with @AdamSchefter, @SuzyNFL32 &amp; Bill Polian.
Sanchez contract actually terminates at 4 pm ET.. Then he's free. No waivers.
Handicapping Sanchez landing spot once he clears waivers: Eagles, Rams &amp; Browns. Chip Kelly could go all Pac10/12 on QBs,w Foles &amp; Barkley
Matt Schaub officially a Raider after passing his physical. 6th round pick in May to Texans
Contrary to anyone's interpetation, Merril Hoge did NOT say he would take Michael Sam over Jadeveon Clowney.
Texans privately met this am for hour w Bridgewater. That's their protocol around Pro Days; Bortles next; extends beyond perceived top 3 QBs
‚Äú@Nebkreb: when does the NFL announce the compensatory picks for the 2014 draft?‚Äù &gt;&gt; coming up at NFL owners meeting early next week
Bridgewater did indeed underwhelm at Pro Day. Tried throwing w/o glove. It's not "numbers" on Pro Day; it's how ball comes out of QB's hand
they're not my words and consensus doesn't mean unanimous ‚Äú@DAT_IS_CRAY: get ready to eat those words mort‚Äù
A handful of evaluators have greater confidence re: Buffalo LB Khalil Mack than Jadeveon Clowney. Mack's skills, consistency &amp; versatility
NFL dirty little secret during salary cap era: Teams use "cap" as alibi to cut many players they want to let go anyway #free agency
NFL Insiders rocking iit on ESPN
Saints slapped @TheJimmyGraham w NON-exclusive tag, creating more drama. Any team can sign Graham for 2 1st picks or Saints can match
Clowney runs a 4.47 unofficial in the 40. #wow
@RJJC_LU thank you!
QB Combine eve, Dave Fales throwing w Jimmy Garoppolo, supervised by pre-draft tutor Jordan Palmer @JwPalms #gymrats http://t.co/U0YMvwXItY
Browns did indeed make a run at Jim Harbaugh that reached a serious stage, sources confirm substance of  @ProFootballTalk report.
Johnny Manziel's hand size just short of 10 inches (9 7/8) very much a positive. All-weather size. Can control ball, throwing &amp; handling
Joe Philbin's decision to address media at 9:45 this morning here in Indy will rank among best-attended pressers with Sam, Manziel, Clowney
Hey, @Espngreeny Brett Favre is not 6-5 but he is the tallest 6-2 guy I've met in the NFL.
Dolphins make it official that O-line coach Jim Turner also has been fired, along w head trainer Kevin O'Neill, as earlier reported
O'Neill only 5th NFL Head Athletics Trainer to win prestigious Tim Kerin Award in '13 by NATA, representing service, dedication &amp; integrity
Kevin O'Neill, now out as Dolphins trainer, came into NFL with Cowboys in 1990 and Jimmy Johnson, then moved on to Miami.
Dolphins have fired longtime head athletics trainer Kevin O'Neill, per league sources. O'Neill was named in the Ted Wells report.

Inspirational story of Mendota HS football on @OTLonESPN Sunday. From California agricultural fields to FB fields http://t.co/qU6lcoCob7
Personnel men say biggest struggle is to project Sam at 6-1 1/2 260 who has played as 4-3 DE w hand on ground. For now, 3rd-5th rd estimates
@Iron4Horse Te'o comparison was used as a point teams felt he was weary by all the attention before &amp; during Combine because of his story
Sam's reps, Cameron Weiss &amp; Joe Barkett, are working w league to find amicable solution for demands at Combine so he can focus on testing
One concern from GMs was wisdom of Sam revealing publicly he is gay before Combine. Felt Te'o was "drained" for '13 Combine testing
GMs and experienced personnel men I spoke with say they were either aware Michael Sam is gay or heard scouts talking about it.
