30 years ago today, fixing bugs  #princeofpersia #journal https://t.co/JRDGMSOCtl
Today I had an urge to re-read one of the 2,500 books I donated a couple of years ago in a @MarieKondo decluttering, and found that it's selling for $800 used on Amazon. I now think it actually DID spark joy on that day and my joy-sparking detector was on the blink.
@tha_rami Reminds me of the Julio Cort√°zar story "We Love Glenda So Much." But then, so do a lot of things these days.
@ryannelson As much as I'd love to set foot in a VR recreation of the 1914 Orient Express, I personally prefer shorter VR experiences (like, 15 minutes max). So my thinking gets stuck at that point.
@tha_rami Amazing! Oh yeah, of course, the Dutch masters were Dutch...
@derekhaas We're gonna die
@tha_rami I know what you mean. He IS our president. That's reality whether we like it or not.. disowning it because "I didn't vote for him" is like sticking our heads in the sand.
@SoundInterest Done :)
@ibjade Wow, it's like a high school reunion!

@HIGHzurrer Hey, my very first screenplay, IN THE DARK back in 1987 looked just like that! Pink cover, brads, and everything. I doubt that's it, though. I don't think I got a Nichol fellowship.
@anulman @pettycommajared Thanks, I'm so glad!
@pettycommajared It was all regular hi-res except the title screen. I'm pretty sure we did a hi-res version of that too. But the only memory I'd be worried about is mine, after 30 years.
@GameDadVII @pettycommajared I didn't! Dan Gorlin did the Amiga port of PoP (very quickly too!)

@johnaugust After 2 years living in France with universal health care, the US private insurance system just seems insane. The uninsured are screwed, while those who can afford it spend a fortune and endless hassle just to have what in Europe is considered a basic human right.
@pettycommajared Yeah, the Apple II was getting a little long in the tooth when I started making the game in 1986. I should probably have switched platforms then but I didn't think it would take me three years.
@KBABZonTV @pettycommajared I was just trying to be logical about it. It's not like a timer running out in a different room of the palace would kill you on the spot.
@clmazin Saturday and Live?
@vale20213 Thanks for asking! I promise if there's news to share, I'll post it here.
@MuratCsmecioglu Thank you!
.@sallyrooney's first two books are so amazingly good, I can't believe they're someone's first two books. And the second one is even better than the first. No pressure though.
@toadmeister Amazing story!
@johnaugust @JonKasdan I like them as a reader. I often read too fast, so when a character speaks twice with no (CONT'D), I sometimes think at first it's the other character replying before I figure it out. My own fault, but it's still a bump.
@jeffcannata Wow!! Go Danny!

Great advice. That was the mindset flip that let me reduce my beloved book library by 90% a few years ago (down from 3,000 tomes). I figured 300 is plenty for one person to own. If I ever want one of the other 2,700 back, there's libraries and bookstores. https://t.co/aqosd55jkr

@clmazin @Massawyrm @alrodz Craig.. PERFECT. Now at the end of Act II you can read the books, realize everything you thought you knew about screenwriting was wrong, follow their advice and write your best screenplay yet. That's called a "Character Arc" as the books will explain.
@johnaugust *sigh* Okay, but if we do that, then can we go back to using it again in 2020?

@octopusjig @reidrac @elmcklain Robert Cook (Gumball, D/Generation) did the C64 and Atari 400/800 ports of Karateka. By the time PoP came out 5 years later, those platforms were too old for Broderbund to support. Dan Gorlin (Choplifter) ported PoP to Amiga.

@RobGMacfarlane The ancient Sumerian myth of Inanna and Ereshkigal is pretty cool.
@CheekyCrissy Highland uses Fountain markup language. It's light, exportable and flexible. You can easily switch to Fade in or FD once you get into actual production and need features like starred changes, locked pages, etc.

@UndercoverMoth2 @skacky Are you close to town, can you get inside somewhere warm for the night? If the car isn't in immediate danger you might consider leaving it where it is until conditions change. I think 112 is the number to call. Gens d'ici, dites-nous si vous avez d'autres id√©es.

@inversephase Of the ones that used my dad's original musical score, the PC port best reflects his intentions. He composed it on a Steinway, though, so the MIDI arrangement involved some compromise.

@garywhitta No argument. Jeez, I haven't seen Krull since it was in theaters. Wasn't it a kind of bladed Frisbee boomerang that only the true king could wield, or am I mixing up my 80s memories?

To be fair, some of these statistics leave room for interpretation. @snopes points out, for example, that the definition of "toddler" is controversial; it might be more accurate to say "pre-schooler." But otherwise, yeah, basically all true. Happy 2018! https://t.co/42LPilzxAC
@J_Guill @rianjohnson @starwars That's not the Jedi movie I was thinking of. But it's not your fault.
@CultTVGuy @rianjohnson @starwars I appreciate your point of view, and your respect. Respectful disagreement is one of the great pleasures of moviegoing, and life!
@J_Guill @rianjohnson @starwars :) It's when you help your actors find traces of human reality in certain moments, instead of just moving them around like talking props like sometimes happens in, uh, some movies

One of the best graphic novels I‚Äôve read this year is @bastienvives ¬´ Polina ¬ª from 2011.

I think @rianjohnson's The Last Jedi is respectful of @StarWars legacy and fans, while being a bold and sincere effort to make it relevant for 2017. With sly humor, technical mastery, and sensitive writing/directing. And yes I saw all the movies in theaters starting in 1977.

@taxalot Right, the form is for foreigners like me who don't have the card. If I showed up at a US doctor's office without ID, they wouldn't let me past reception.
Yep. As an American I had a similar feeling of "this can't be real" when I experienced France's universal free health care. Hilariously, French doctors are continually apologizing for what they call paperwork (a single form that takes 30 seconds). https://t.co/t8UQ6KbPr7

@Des_Roin @osamadorias @PlayOverwatch @Des_Roin, I can imagine how much it hurts you to hear people chanting death. My own family suffered from people demonizing all Jews. But that doesn't make it ok to demonize Muslims, it makes it even more important not to.

@MikeJMika Choplifter blew me away. Huge inspiration for Karateka
@MikeJMika Yeah, I'd agree with you. The Apple/Amiga animation is still the most fluid, in part because of the simple graphics.
@MikeJMika But the definitive port is the DOS version by Lance Groody. It was the slickest (VGA, digitized SFX, MIDI) and the most widely played.
@MikeJMika The Apple version is close to my heart cause it's the original, and the only one I programmed myself.
@MikeJMika The Amiga version was a very faithful port of the Apple version by Dan Gorlin. Same microprocessor, so could reuse most of the code.

@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA Done.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA sure. Email me for info at jordan at mechner dot com.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA Not true in this case. We called the carrier and they confirmed all info correct but could not help us.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA Your site says "Travelers with a KTN are MORE LIKELY to receive TSA Pre screening." We weren't told it was a lottery.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA JetBlue told us that even with a KTN (which she has) it's still a lottery.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA LAX does. The issue is we both paid for Pre but it only appeared on my pass, not hers, despite a call to the airline.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA Today, I won but my wife didn't, so we took the long line. Then she "won" a sales pitch for service she already bought.
@TSAmedia_RossF @TSA Our whole family registered and paid for TSAPre, but lottery is now individual so unless we ALL win, it's worthless.
Anyone out there considering @TSA Pre, don't waste your money. They've changed it to a worthless "lottery." http://t.co/37KF1DOPA6

@PitDocX I feel the evil when I read of long term impact &amp; recovery from injury. Repeating sensational, violent footage dulls empathy.
News images of carnage exploit victims, desensitize the public, reward perpetrators &amp; motivate imitators. Glorify first responders instead.
