Really looking forward to seeing Timothy Weah in the second half #Speed #USMNT #USAvPAR
My take after the first half  1) I’m very impressed with the improvement of Matt Miazga. His positioning and decision making have vastly improved.  2) Tyler Adams continues to impress me after each time I see him play. His movement and vision put him in great spots.  #USMNT #USA
It’s my first time with the twins alone for two nights. Warning to the people in New England, If you see flares in the sky that’s just my distress call. #ZoneDefense #Twins

GERMANY WINS THE WORLD CUP!!!! Unbelievable performances from the Germans. They deserve it. #Germany #WorldCup
Love the Per Mertesacker substitution.  The great 1 minute appearance. #supersub #Arsenal #Germany #WorldCupFinal
GOOOOAAAAALLL!!!! Mario Goetze! Beautiful goal. Showed great technique with that finish. 1-0 Germany in extra time. #WorldCupFinal #GERvsARG
Germany needs to get Sami Khedira into the game. They need his physical presence in the midfield. #WorldCup2014 #GERvsARG #WorldCupFinal
Argentina win!!!! On to the finals vs Germany. Will be a great final! Can Messi lead his country to a World Cup victory?#Vamos #WorldCup2014
And of course he misses the first penalty kick..... #NEDvsARG #WorldCup2014
On to PENALTIES!!! Ron Vlaar is the player of the match. Has been stellar in the back for the Dutch. Rock solid and won every challenge.
Who steps up today, Messi or Robben? That will be the difference today. #WorldCup2014 #Argentina #Netherlands
I'm not believing my eyes.... 5-0 Germany over BRAZIL. Clinical and unselfish finishing from the Germans. #BRAvsGER #WorldCup2014 #GameOver
4-0 Germany now. Kroos with the 3rd and 4th goal. Brazil have just fallen apart. This match is all but over. So Disappointing #BRAvsGER
2-0 Germany over Brazil. All hats off to Klose for breaking Ronaldo's World Cup scoring record! 16 goals in WC competition. #BRAvsGER #Klose
Netherlands win! The dream is over for Costa Rica. They can leave with their heads held high. Great World Cup for the Ticos.#Ticos #CONCACAF
Costa Rica have held the Dutch! Now to PENALTY KICKS!!! Brilliant job by the Costa Ricans. Vamos #Ticos #NEDvsCRC #WorldCup2014 #CONCACAF
Another great World Cup match! Brazil holds off Colombia 2-1 to advance to the semifinals. Thiago Silva misses semis. #Brazil #WorldCup2014
PENALTY FOR COLOMBIA!!!! James Rodriguez makes it 2-1!!' It will be an interesting finish to this game. #BRAvsCOL #WorldCup2014
Unbelievable GOAL!!!! David Luiz with a blast. 2-0 Brazil! #BRAvsCOL #WorldCup2014
Halftime. Fernadinho has been absolutely brilliant for Brazil. Winning tackles and breaking up plays. #BRAvsCOL #WorldCup2014 #Brazil
Too many bad passes and not enough quality from Colombia. Sanchez and Zapata have been very poor. They need to make some changes at half!
Who makes the difference today? James Rodriguez? Neymar? Oscar? Cuadrado? Ospina? #BRAvsCOL #WorldCup2014 #Vamos
Germany wins 1-0 and on to their 4th consecutive World Cup semi-finals! France did to little to late. #FRAvsGER #WorldCup2014
Halftime 1-0 Germany. France needs Benzema to be more involved. Should be a good 2nd half. #FRAvsGER #AllezLesBleus #WorldCup2014
1-0 Germany! It's Hummels with the header on the set piece. #WorldCup2014 #FRAvsGER
Happy 4th of July!!!! Enjoy the day and be safe! #USA
We never gave up! Battled to the final whistle. Great to see Julian Green get his first goal for the United States. Proud of the boys! #USA
Extra time. Tim Howard has been brilliant!!! Proving he is one of the best in the world. We have to finish our chances.... #USAvsBEL #USA
USA!!!! I believe! Can't wait for this one. #USA #USAvsBEL #WorldCup2014

I’ll be at the new @DICK’s Sporting Goods in Seabrook, NH at 700 Lafayette Rd. from 3:00-4:30 pm today. Stop by and see me!
1-1 Alexis Sanchez ties it up!!! Chile is very strong and Brazil should be worried. #BRAvsCHI #WC2014 #Chile
“@SI_BenReiter: I watched #USA #GER with the man who wasn't there: who's optimistic while embracing his own reality. http://t.co/ooV6Ec8Vik”

GOAL for Croatia! My former teammate at Sochaux, Ivan Perisic, makes it 3-1. #CROvsMEX
3-0!!!! Chicharito finally scores for Mexico! Wow they can finish top of the group with one more goal! #CONCACAF #CROvsMEX #WC2014
GOOOLLLLL! Guardado with a nice left footed finish and it looks like Croatia is falling apart. Vamos Mexico! #CONCACAF
GOLASOOOOOO! Vamos Mexico!!! Marquez with the header off a corner. 1-0 #CONCACAF #CROvsMEX #WorldCup2014 #Mexico
In the end the World's Best Player @Cristiano found a way to impact the game. That assist could be the thing to get him going #CR7 #Portugal
Wow! What a game! The US deserved the win &amp; 3 points but we are still in a great position to advance. Big game next Thursday vs Germany #USA
DEMPSEY!!!!!! Who else!? 2-1 USA! Yedlin has been a great spark off the bench! @clint_dempsey #USAvsPOR #USA #IBelieveThatWeWillWin
GOOOOAAALLLLLLLL! Jermaine Jones!!!! 1-1. A screamer into the side netting. Jones has been outstanding! #USAvsPOR #USA #USMNT #GroupOfDeath
Much better with possession against Portugal then we did vs Ghana.Clint had a great 1st half. Very confident we will get the equalizer!#USA

My New England Revolution teammate Jerry Bengston so close with the go ahead goal. 1-1 Honduras v Ecuador #Honduras #CONCACAF #WC2014
Benzema is a beast! 4-0 France. Allez! France is making a statement. Putting on a clinic vs the Swiss. #WorldCup2014 #SUIvsFRA
Allez le Bleu!!! 3-0 France.
Blaise Matuidi makes in 2-0 and the Swiss are unraveling. The French are serious contenders. #France #Ligue1 #WorldCup2014
Oliver Giroud!!!! 1-0 France! The man can score goals! #Arsenal #France #WC2014
Costa Rica advances out of their group with this win!!!! Vamos Ticos! They shock the Italians &amp; the world! #CONCACAF #WorldCup2014 #ITAvsCRC
Halftime! Extremely impressed with the Costa Ricans. Going toe to toe with the European giants. Vamos! #ticos #CONCACAF #WorldCup2014
Vamos!!!!!! Golaso!! What a goal! Upset Alert! 1-0 Costa Rica over Italy. Wow!!! Playing superbly
Campbell needs to have a big game for Costa Rica today. #CONCACAF #Arsenal #Ticos #WorldCup2014
What are everyone's thoughts on the Italy vs Costa Rica match today? Italy are the favorites but CR showed vs Uruguay they are capable
Suarez and Uruguay get it done. What a game!! Rooney gets the monkey off his back with his 1st WC goal but it wasn't enough. #URUvsENG
Halftime. 1-0 Uruguay. Rooney had England's best chance. They need to make some changes. Will be an entertaining 2nd half. #URUvsENG
Luis Suarez!!!! 1-0 Uruguay. Great ball from Cavani. The danger man is back and the questions surrounding his fitness are gone. #URUvsENG
ROONEY of the bar!!! Still 0-0. #URUvsENG
England have to do better with their set pieces. #URUvsENG #WorldCup2014
Suarez is so dangerous. England have to be aware of him at all times. #Uruguay #URUvsENG
After this loss I think Ivory Coast has realized they must have Didier Drogba on the pitch from the start. #legend #WorldCup2014 #IvoryCoast
Match of the day coming up. England v Uruguay. Go on England! Would love to see them finally break through in the World Cup #England #WC14
Great win tonight in the US Open Cup. Next match is Wednesday vs Rochester.  Looking forward to it and thanks for the support! #NERevs #MLS
Now to focus on our US Open Cup match tonight vs Richmond. Thanks for ll the support! #NERevs #MLS
Spain are OUT! They have been outplayed in this World Cup and it is time for a change. David De Gea's time to shine. #EndOfAnEra
Chile are just having their way with Spain.  Spain are in shambles
Alexis Sanchez will be a hot commodity this summer. What a buy he will be. Fantastic player. Arsene he is your man. #Arsenal #Chile
2-0 Chile!!!!! Iker Casillas with another costly mistake in goal and I believe that is game over. #WorldCup2014
If you're Spain Xabi Alonso must come off at Half. You put on the likes of Santi Carzola, David Villa or Fernando Torres.
CHILE!!!!!! GOLASO!!!! 1-0 Chile.  What composure on that finish.  Spain in a lot of trouble. #WorldCup2014 #SpainvsChile
@an1310 Mark Geiger has done an outstanding job officiating in the World Cup thus far. Representing the United States &amp; @MLS #WorldCup2014
Predictions for the Spain vs Chile game? I think Spain come out flying &amp; make this a statement game. No room for complacency #WorldCup2014
The Netherlands did what they had to in the end to get the 3 points.  They underestimated the Aussies and the Aussies had a great performace
Fortunes can change so quick in this beautiful game. Australia had the chance to take the lead then the Netherlands punish Australia. 3-2
RVP!!! 2-2.  Van Persie was not missing from there. The Dutch are coming alive. #WorldCup2014 #NetherlandsvsAustralia
GOAAAAAL!!!! Australia takes the lead! 2-1. #Socceroos #WorldCup2014
PENALTY!!!!!! Australia can take the lead......
@JuanPaGalavis the golaso was divino jaja
Australia playing some exciting football right now. Going toe to toe with the Netherlands. Getting quality chances #Socceroos #WorldCup2014
Tim Cahill with the goal of the tournament thus far? I think so....
WOW! Robben with a goal of individual brilliance and then Cahill with a beautiful volley to tie things up. WOW #WorldCup2014
Tune into @espn for the Netherlands v Australia match.  I hope to see many goals in this one. #WorldCup2014 #RVP #Robben
1-1. Russia with the equalizer. A very opportunistic goal.
The usually dependable Akinfeev with a costly mistake. South Korea 1 - Russia 0. #WorldCup2014
Clint Dempsey is a solider. Playing with a broken nose. Putting his country ahead of pain. #OneNationOneTeam #usmnt #pride @clint_dempsey
Just landed in Richmond, Virginia for our US Open Cup game tomorrow night. Excited to get going again!
Mexico v Brazil! Will be in the air for the first 60 minutes. Bummed. Vamos Mexico. Love a good upset. #CONCACAF #WorldCup2014
Belgium stepped up when they had to. Subs came in and changed the game. A good lesson for the Belgium team.
Belgium did not come out to play this far. They must take it to the next gear. Algeria is playing with confidence &amp; defending with passion
3 points and we are in a great position to advance. Portugal is ready for the taking. #IBelieveThatWeWillWin #USMNT #groupofdeath
GOAAAALLLLLL!!!!!! John Brooks #usa #USAvsGhana #WorldCup2014
Absolutely gutted for Jozy. Prayers he will be able to return in this tournament. @JozyAltidore #USMNT
Yes Clint!!!!!! 1-0 USA! Couldn't of had a better start. #USA #USAvGHA #WorldCup2014
Worst case scenario happened for Portugal today. When the US take care of business tonight vs Ghana, we will be in prime position to advance
“@LeeNguyen24: Beachin' http://t.co/uVRzuJr06O”&gt; Great weekend
Germany are just too strong and with Pepe's costly mistake it could prove to be detrimental for Portugal in goal differential. #WorldCup2014
Will Cristiano show up today? I'm excited for this one! #portugalvsgermany #worldcup2014
Wishing the USMNT the best of luck today! Big things ahead for ussoccer #WorldCup2014 #USMNT #USA http://t.co/UyAmIvKh8g
Drogba = instant offense #legend #IvoryCoastvsJapan #WorldCup2014
Italy just had too much experience. Played to their strengths and the best team when holding a lead. Fantastic football! #WorldCup2014
Super Mario!!!!! Balotelli finds a way. Arsene Wenger sign him up!!! #Arsenal
“@JuanPaGalavis: BEST first half of FUTBOL in this World Cup... England 1 Italy 1”&gt; Spain v Netherlands???? Come on
Sturridge! Game on!!!!!! 1-1 Italy v England. Gotta love it!! #WorldCup2014 #EnglandvsItaly
And there it is!!!!! Costa Rica 3 Uruguay 1. Vamos Ticos!!! #CONCACAF #WorldCup2014
Wowwwww. Campbell and Costa Rica representing Concacaf well! Upset alert...... #WorldCup2014
England v Italy is match of the day. What are your predictions? I think England starts off the tournament strong with a big win.
Colombia is an exciting team. It is 2-0 and they still have an extra gear
5 goals dropped on Spain!!!??! Who would of thought. Van Persie and Robben have been brilliant.
Are the Netherlands early World Cup favorites after this win??? #RVP #NetherlandsVsSpain #WorldCup2014
Robin Van Persie with a dream finish. The run, the vision and the goal. #topclass #NetherlandsVsSpain #WorldCup
That's how you start a World Cup! Croatia were unlucky. Can't wait to see tomorrow's Spain v Netherlands match. Who you got?

Now I'm really excited for Arsenal v Man City and then later NFL playoffs Patriots v Texans. #Sundays
Sir Alex up off the bench now..... Liverpool is starting to put a lot of pressure on United.
Sturridge!!! 2-1. Game on
RVP is too good! I don't think Man Utd will have trouble getting a result in this one.
I'm fighting the jet lag to try and watch this. I think i'll be lucky to get to halftime.  #heavyeyelids
Have to love NFL playoff games. Funny how games can change so quickly. Ravens up 14-7 after starting down 7-0.

And Man Utd makes the statement with the 3-2 win.
RVP!!!!!
How things can change in a game of football.....2-2 89th min. Man City going for the winner
MAN UTD is too strong. Really playing well as a team and deserve to be up 2-0 at halftime.

Good luck to my DC boys tonight vs NYRB!!
@ThaRealTMart The chicken cheese steak in the lower dining hall @BostonCollege for sure.
Now it game over with Wilshire being sent off. Arsenal can't compete for a title with the likes of Man Utd, Man City &amp; Chelsea.  Sad truth..
Sir Alex was smart to take Cleverly off
The ref could have easily given Cleverly a second yellow there
Wow!! Rooney misses penalty....
Arsenal need Walcott on the field ASAP
I haven't ever seen Arsenal give the ball away so cheaply. Combined with awful defending
Arsenal look shocking
Unreal start to this game.... RVP
Interested to see how the Arsenal fans react to RVP. Do you think he will score against his former team?
Man Utd vs Arsenal! Come on you gunners!
Excited to see how the MLS Playoffs play out.  Hoping my boys in DC take care of business.

RT: @TonyValente24: @CharlieDavies9 who would u want to be your CAM? Ronaldinho, Riquelme, Kaka, or Sneijder?&lt; Riquelme is a beast.
then Maradona and Zidane (Zizou)
I would choose Ronaldo (R9), who is my favorite player of all time, and Messi.  Pelé in a close 3rd.
Ronaldo(R9), Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Pelè, Romario, Thierry Henry or Gerd Muller???? @JozyAltidore @AleBedoya17  @SachaKljestan Pick 2!
Time to make things tougher. Ronaldinho, Zidane, Maradona, Van Basten, Johan Cruyff or Michel Platini??? Pick 2
I'd go with Henry
Raúl or Gabriel Batistuta or Patrick Kluivert or Thierry Henry??? This one is not so easy.
So far I'm going with Zidane, Bergkamp, Lothar and Rivaldo.
Hristo Stoichkov or Rivaldo or Fernando Redondo?
Lothar Matthäus or Dunga or Edgar Davids in their prime?
Dennis Bergkamp or Luis Figo or Roberto Baggio? In their prime which player would you choose?
Debate is over lol. Zidane it is. My point exactly.
Oliver and I are having some serious debates. Xavi or Zidane in their prime? Who are you taking first?

Great to see El Niño coming back strong for Spain. They are still the team to beat.
@tjschaefer3 Germany is very good.
Tactics needed to be better from the Netherlands at the start. Too little too late tonight
2-1 Game on!
RVP!!!!
Huntelaar is most definitely coming on and I think Van der Vaart should as well.  Will be a good second half. Gomez has silenced his critics
Gomez again and it's 2-0
Gomez just scores goals! Flat out.  1-0 Germany
@stitchersammi I hope your mom is feeling better. Stay strong
Let's go RVP....close one
Everyone has good picks and predictions. Let's just hope for a game that had as much entertainment as Portugal v Denmark.
@Nick_Tait8 I'm going with RVP today.
So who do you think will be the game changer today? RVP? Robben? Sneijder? Afellay? or Gomez? Ozil? Muller? Podolski?
@AleBedoya17 You would...
@J1NKL3 Agreed
As you can see even one of the best players in the world, Cristiano, can miss the easiest of chances. He will rebound from this
Great game. Now this next game will be very entertaining. I'm going with Holland. Robin Van Persie will step up
@juanitoo22 What were you saying buddy?
Game over! Portugal wins
@psubuzz @ESPN hahaha my bad
@EuanHolden of course I would mate!
Portugal takes the lead 3-2. Varela comes on and smashes one in. Can they hold on??
GOALASSSOOO
2-2 Denmark has come back!! Bendtner with the brace
No wayyyyy
Wow....
Nani is a beast on that right side. Denmark having a tough time dealing with him.
Bendtner gets one back for Denmark. 2-1 now and Denmark is starting to get a little more confidence.
Portugal is finishing today
PEPE!!!!!
Cristiano needs to step it up now....
Let's keep it going USA! Up 1-0 at Halftime on a goal from my good friend @clint_dempsey.
Thanks everyone!
“@RVINCENTG: @CharlieDavies9 u must be bumping #CashinOut ..... Ridin round wit dat Nina!”&lt; hahaha

@Yagmito I thought my FC Sochaux teammate Damien Perquis has played well for Poland.
@EthanWhite15 @BMcDonald4 I'm on it.  What's uppp
What a strike!!! Can Poland pull it off?
Shevchenko's brace yesterday was the highlight of the Euro's so far. Great to see him still put the ball in the back of the net at his age.
I think Holland will put it together tomorrow.  Well see how it goes.
Really impressed with the Euros this summer.  Exciting matches and good soccer. Holland v Germany tomorrow. Should be an amazing match.
What has been your favorite game of the Euros thus far?
Sock game? Ummm check  http://t.co/NVTCPysR

I haven't been to Australia, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Bora Bora, Dubai or the Dominican. I don't think you can go wrong with those
If you had a one way ticket to anywhere in the world, where would you go and why? Caribbean? Hawaii? Australia? Africa? Asia?Remote Island?
So it's 70-30 in favor of Cam. I'd go with Cam too because he is a beast not only running but passing. Tebow is still a beast cuz he wins!
Ok if you had to pick between Tim Tebow and Cam Newton who are you taking and why as your franchise QB?
@RBauer813 Ok you're right about him having awful receivers. lol
@TaylorTwellman You got 6 years on me bro!!! LOL
We can all agree that Ryan Leaf, Jamarcus Russell and Painter are worse, but this rookie, Gabbert, has no upside
@TaylorTwellman Agreed but the guy can't complete a pass over 20 yards. Where is the upside?  It's Jones-Drew or bust
@RBauer813 Umm Have you seen Gabbert throw a ball??? His throws are awful and there is a stat that he has not completed a pass over 20yds!!!
I guess I can't argue with Curtis Painter hahaha. I haven't seen any Colts games this season so there you go
@Taylor851 Rookie!? That's not an excuse buddy. Have you seen CAM NEWTON??? ANDY DALTON???
Question..... Is the Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback the worst you have ever seen play the position as a starting QB?
I'm dead tired and it's only 5pm here in San Diego.  Any good movies out in theaters worth seeing?

@whereishawkins I forgot about Rowdy Roddy Piper!! That was a good one
LOL
Last one Non soccer question... Favorite WWF wrestler of all time? Rick Flair? Shawn Michaels? Undertaker? Brett Hart? The Rock? Stone Cold?
@Wynalda11 Agreed hahaha RVP Augero Drogba
@steverose6 stay strong and focus on being positive throughout your rehab. Wishing you the speediest of recoveries
@banga_c I appreciate fans like you that have had my back through thick and thin. Much love
@Carlos220x2 Best striker of all time for me is R9 the original Ronaldo el phenomeno
David Silva has been special this season too. Rooney had his run of good form as well
So most of you think RVP & Aguero. You can't really aruge with that.  So will RVP win player of the year in EPL? Has to right?
@CaptainJLez9 Appreciate it, Thanks!
Drogba & Aguero would be ridiculous too
Aguero & Van Persie is a good one.  Rooney & Suarez
You have Rooney, Van Persie, Suarez, Augero, Balotelli, Adebayor, Dzeko, Ba to choose from. Remember they have to have chemistry.
Ok, if you were a coach and had the choice to choose any two strikers in the EPL to play together who are you taking?
And will Man City win the league this season or will Utd finish strong?
@RonnyRealNice My man, I took a little Twitter vacation but now the kid is backkkk lol
I never thought RVP was an outright striker but after this season he has changed my mind.
@MattF15 I was thinking Carew
@Brendanukkah Nope I have that Jersey.
@Stephen_Scott14 hahaha
A lot of you think Aguero, but I think City rotates too much with Balotelli and Dzeko
You think Robin Van Persie will take the EPL Golden boot?
Wowwwww
NOOOOOOOO Come on Madrid!
Red card for sure lol
What a great half. What are you expecting in the 2nd half?
Class Goal
GOALLLLLLLLL!!!!
Madrid is home so I'm hoping they can finally get a good win..... legggo
I'm amped for this El Clasico. Real Madrid v Barcelona. Can Madrid win? Should be a great match either way
@robbierogers Ok well see bro
