But as far as pace of play. It will never go down with tv making you wait 2 min 45 between innings.
There are really only two ways to make the offense go up. Bring back juice for the cheaters are go to aluminum bats.
@jaysonst Can we just leave the game alone! Why do we always have to change things that‚Äôs not broken.
What if we trained starters to go deep into games. Then we wouldn‚Äôt have to change rules to speed up game pace! Wow wouldn‚Äôt that make sense!

@brianmctaggart @MLBNetwork ed - insurance against a prior out being undone on appeal. These fourth out situations are not the same as four strikeouts in an inning.
@brianmctaggart @MLBNetwork will supersede the apparent third out, thus becoming the recorded third out.[1] For statistical purposes, the apparent third out is "undone" and the fourth out's result is recorded instead. With the advent of video replay appeals, a new rationale for making extra out(s) has emerg
@brianmctaggart @MLBNetwork In baseball, the fourth out is a legal out made by the defense after three outs in a half-inning already have been made. According to the rules, the third out does not cause the ball to become dead; if the fielders make a subsequent out that prevents a run from scoring, this out

@jcderr @TylerKepner @brianmctaggart we are basing a mans career on a Mitchell report and the size of a man.
@jcderr @TylerKepner @brianmctaggart 90 percent is better then a guess
@TylerKepner The only way to get who deserves to be in the Hall of Fame is to make the nominees take a polygraph. Including the ones in.

Haters are like crickets. Crickets make a lot of noise, you hear it but you can't see them. Then right when you walk by them, they're quiet.
@tdurante2125 don't think that's me .
@MotivatedLiving :Champions either find a way, or they make one.
Your life is your message to the world. Make it inspiring!
@CarpenterWhitey happy birthday

Can't wait to get back up to philly ! I'll see you guys Saturday . Hope I can get the first pitch across the plate . :)
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.
High achievement always takes place in a framework of high expectation.
The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
Happy Easter !
Dang squirrels !!!!

To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.
A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.
Life begins as a quest of the child for the man, and ends as a journey by the man to rediscover the child.
When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would have no talent left, and I could say I used everything you gave me
