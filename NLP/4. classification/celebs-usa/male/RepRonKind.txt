Great to meet with student leaders from @UWEauClaire earlier this week. We talked about the important issues facing the next generation of Wisconsinites, and how we can help our students earn a better life by lowering student loan debt and increasing opportunity. https://t.co/D94i0xcxib
The President‚Äôs emergency declaration is distracting Congress from the important issues Wisconsinites care about, and is a gross overreach by one branch of our government. Plain and simple: this isn‚Äôt the way it should be done. https://t.co/QJ8ab98cGm
Great to stop by Lazy Monk Brewing in Eau Claire today to talk about a new bill I introduced last week that will give our small and craft brewers a fair shot. Cheers to Wisconsin beer! https://t.co/J9oIIWi2rk

Taking action on gun violence and being respectful about Second Amendment rights are not mutually exclusive. Only by working together on this can we prevent these mass shootings from happening. | 2/2
Today, we remember the lives lost in the horrific Parkland shooting.  Gun violence cannot be our new normal.  It's time to move forward on commonsense gun safety measures in this new Congress, and protect our children and families. | 1/2
This isn't sustainable, and this isn't fair to the next generation. Our kids and grandkids are going to be paying the price for Washington's fiscal irresponsibility for years to come. https://t.co/ZypKtA2BQW
Today, I introduced a bill that will help grow WI craft breweries by reducing tax burdens and restrictive regulations for our brewers.

John‚Äôs wise words stuck with me, and I‚Äôve passed his advice along as I mentor new Members here in the House. His wit and wisdom will be missed.
I‚Äôll never forget what John said: You have an important job, but you‚Äôre not an important person. The minute you think you are is the minute you cut corners.
When I first came to Congress, John Dingell was one of the first people I sought out for advice.
Tawni and I are saddened to hear about the passing of former Rep. John Dingell. John challenged all of us to come together to make life better for all Americans. His positive attitude will be missed. Our prayers go to Debbie, the Dingell family and our Michigan neighbors tonight.
Great to be on Central Time talking about the issues facing Wisconsinites in rural communities! Listen to the interview here: https://t.co/cCpqusecdH https://t.co/4qHO2X2Ys8
Proud to lead a bipartisan, bicameral team in introducing the Trade Security Act of 2019. It is long-past time for Congress to reassert its constitutionally-granted power in our Nation‚Äôs #trade policy and protect our export power. Read more here: https://t.co/lZiezr0V0s
We have a problem when it comes to retirement savings. I am proud to introduce the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, which l will help Wisconsinites grow savings accounts and help us avoid a retirement savings shortfall in the future. #RESA https://t.co/lwYkmdV7BD
3/3 I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to find common ground, and will fight to break down the hyper-partisanship in Congress to make life better for Wisconsinites. There is far more that brings us together than divides us.
2/3 We don‚Äôt need a Republican or Democratic agenda ‚Äì we need an American agenda. I was encouraged to hear bipartisan proposals in tonight‚Äôs #SOTU, including a commitment to lowering drug prices, rebuilding our failing infrastructure, and investing in cancer research.
1/3 We can all agree: America needs unity.
Wisconsinites like Ramon are the heart of our rural communities. It is an honor to invite him as a tribute to our first responders and volunteers who work tirelessly to lift our communities higher and move us forward.
I look forward to Ramon Knudtson joining me for the #SOTU. Ramon has dedicated his life to making Wisconsin stronger through his work with the Village of Melrose, the Wisconsin Rural Water Association, and the Melrose Fire Department.
Great to join Scott and Elizabeth at the @LaCrosseTribune for Tribcast, the Tribune's podcast. We talked about the State of the Union, what Washington is up to this week, and the path forward in the 116th Congress. Check it out here üëá https://t.co/SuNC8e74aF

Foxconn has a bad track record of breaking promises, and now it's clear that Wisconsin's taxpayers are the ones getting fleeced.  If the late, great Senator Bill Proxmire were still alive, the Foxconn project would take home his Golden Fleece Award. https://t.co/fCgQSWqnil

This shutdown cost us $3 Billion, and we'll never get it back. Shutdowns have consequences long after they end, and should NEVER be a negotiating tactic. https://t.co/0XHMRyvx22
2/2 Now it‚Äôs time to get in the same room and work together to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions that effectively fix our broken immigration system.
1/2 Reopening the government is the right first step to moving forward from this embarrassing shutdown - but this short-term compromise bill cannot lead to another shutdown.  The federal government and its workers should never be used by anyone as hostages for a policy goal.
Wisconsin farmers, workers and families can't afford more tariffs, and are suffering the consequences of this trade war. This bill - and the administration's bad trade policy - will hurt our rural economy and America's heartland. https://t.co/mNxSvKVjNo
Wilbur Ross, who spent a decade reporting a nearly $3 BILLION net worth, doesn't understand why Wisconsin's federal workers &amp; contractors, farmers, and families can't afford this shutdown. Talk about out of touch. https://t.co/FNPglrrxzE
In Case You Missed It: Yesterday, I unveiled my plan to reopen the federal government. Check it out here: https://t.co/fUA6YxH6EU
It‚Äôs time we create a pathway to citizenship that funds border modernization and stops the inflow of drugs into our country, while promoting the legal immigration that Wisconsin‚Äôs farmers, businesses and communities need. Read more here: https://t.co/4EHSSV1qrK
There is no question that our immigration system is broken and badly in need of repair. Instead of refusing to work together, I‚Äôm proposing a compromise: commonsense solutions to the problems that we face, and at no cost to Wisconsinites. https://t.co/qyg9fLzshX
Wisconsin's breweries contribute to our local economy and our state's culture. This shutdown is threatening the ability to sell our beer across state lines, and is hurting our businesses.   https://t.co/vsakyF3CYS
The shutdown is hurting Wisconsin farmers, businesses and families. Both sides need to get in the same room and have a meaningful discussion about how to move forward. Let‚Äôs reopen the government and get serious about 21st-century border security.

(2/3) The lawsuit threatens to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and it‚Äôs protections over 2.4 million Wisconsinites living with pre-existing conditions.
(1/3) Yesterday, I voted to protect Wisconsinites‚Äô healthcare by helping pass a resolution that strengthens Congress‚Äôs hand to intervene in Texas v. U.S., an appalling lawsuit previously led by Brad Schimel and Scott Walker.
Today is #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay. Thank you to the men &amp; women who put their lives on the line to protect us. As the brother of a police officer, I know firsthand the hard work &amp; dedication our Law Enforcement shows to our communities every day.  Thank you!

The longer we let this shutdown continue, the more it jeopardizes our national security and the economic growth that we need right now in this country. https://t.co/c6DfKb5I7L
A trade war, low commodity prices, major farm consolidation - and now a government shutdown. Wisconsin's family farmers shouldn't be used as pawns, and can't afford the chaos caused by this shutdown. This needs to end. https://t.co/BNECXXKzch
Today, we enter a new chapter in our representative democracy. Progress is only possible in a divided government if we put our differences aside and work together to move Wisconsin ‚Äì and America - forward. #116thCongress

(2/3) and in Chicago and San Francisco. It cuts $800 million from vital conservation programs, and does nothing to address the damage caused by the President‚Äôs trade war.
(1/3) This Farm Bill maintains a status quo that will drive more family farmers out of business. It fails to rein in wasteful subsidies and crop insurance programs that lead to overproduction by big Agribusiness, and sends taxpayer dollars to billionaires on Wall Street,

Wisconsinites working to rebuild their homes, farms &amp; businesses after severe storms deserve the same federal disaster assistance as those who caught the attention of the national media...but Wisconsin is excluded from the federal tax recovery package on the House floor tomorrow.

Today, I cosponsored the Opioid &amp; Heroin Abuse Crisis Investment Act, which will extend resources for drug abuse prevention grants for an additional 5 years. I'm proud to cosponsor this important bill so we can continue creating &amp; growing preventive programs that help protect WI.
We all agreed that prevention is key, yet many of our communities are facing limited or expiring deadlines for grants that help fund prevention programs.
Earlier this week, I met with healthcare professionals, law enforcement officials, and community leaders in Eau Claire to talk about Wisconsin's drug crisis.
Great to join The Morning Show on @WPR this a.m. We talked about the importance of protecting the Mississippi River, the status of the 2018 Farm Bill, and the negative impact of tariffs on Wisconsin farmers, workers and families. Listen here: https://t.co/xlX5oBGaoK

Combatting the drug epidemic in Wisconsin is an all-hands-on-deck moment. Now more than ever, it's clear that in order to break the cycle of addiction, we will need strong partnerships at the federal, state and local levels. https://t.co/sOT2TRabfK
Today, I met w/ Eau Claire-area community leaders that are working tirelessly to help break the cycle of addiction &amp; end the drug epidemic in WI. Thankful I had the opportunity to listen &amp; learn more about the epidemic, &amp; will continue the fight to protect &amp; heal WI communities. https://t.co/HLc9CrW5Q4
Clearly, this hurts an important part of Wisconsin's economy. It‚Äôs time that Washington stops this trade war and starts fighting for Wisconsin businesses and jobs.
According to the @beerinstitute, over 8,000 jobs are supported in Wisconsin‚Äôs Third Congressional District by the beer industry, with a total economic impact of over $1 Billion.
Our breweries are an important part of the Wisconsin heritage and economy. Today, I toured the La Crosse City Brewery, and discussed the impact of the President‚Äôs aluminum tariffs on industries and products Wisconsin is proud of, like beer. https://t.co/hsO7aFvnUq
The Mississippi River shapes our environment, culture and our local economy. We need to take proactive steps to protect the river for generations to come. https://t.co/JK7ezGd046

The irony of President Trump coming to Wisconsin to praise Foxconn - a Taiwanese company that has required billions of Wisconsin taxpayer incentives - while threatening to tax Wisconsin‚Äôs own Harley Davidson out of existence, is not lost on Wisconsinites. https://t.co/z7Kuo8V2DL

30 states still lack discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans, proving that the fight for equality is far from over. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, which will help move Wisconsin and America forward. #EqualityForward
Now more than ever, America needs to give respect and decency a shot. This week, try having a beer with a neighbor you don't usually agree with. It may not be the easy way, but it‚Äôs the Wisconsin way.
Five years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Today, I‚Äôm urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.
The Farm Bill that passed today lavishes millions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies on big agribusinesses &amp; cuts vital conservation programs at the expense of family farmers. We need a Farm Bill that will work for our family farmers in WI ‚Äì not for powerful special interests in DC
No question that our immigration system is broken &amp; in need of repair, but separating families is wrong. It has never been the policy of our Nation to use children as political pawns. I am proud to support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to stop this practice &amp; reunite families.
The keystone of our democracy is holding the power to choose our representatives - not the other way around. The U.S. Supreme Court's delayed decision on fair voting maps is disappointing, but not the end of the fight. https://t.co/CGPB5J8GMH

As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I know that one of the most important bills for growing our local economy and supporting small and family farms is the Farm Bill. Yesterday, I released my 2018 Farm Bill Priorities Report, which you can find on my website: https://t.co/uXgUc7eg2S https://t.co/QBRbG5neUh

These tariffs are a direct response to the President‚Äôs short-sighted trade decisions. It‚Äôs time that we stop treating our allies like our enemies, and set trade standards that support Wisconsin jobs. https://t.co/ScYjTFUKQ4
There are no winners in trade wars ‚Äî only losers. The impacts on American manufacturers and the retribution exacted upon American farmers and ranchers will be substantial, costing us more jobs than will be saved.  It's time for Congress to reclaim its powers over trade policies. https://t.co/Mc4IEJMPWy

@RepRonKind's statement on the 2018 Farm Bill: https://t.co/TgwZdJgO1t
I have never seen a worse Farm Bill than what‚Äôs being debated in the House today. This isn‚Äôt what our farmers need, and not how Washington should function.
This #FarmBill is our chance to fix what‚Äôs not working for our farmers, not funnel more giveaways to millionaires &amp; huge agribusiness. The Farm Bill in its current form will force our farmers to work harder just to get by. Unacceptable.
This week, the House Rules Committee voted to block my money-saving, bipartisan amendments to the Farm Bill. This is yet another example of Washington putting itself before hardworking Wisconsin farmers, workers, and families.
I have traveled across Wisconsin to meet with our farmers, and hear the same thing over and over: Now, more than ever, we need a bill that levels the playing field.
As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I know that one of the most important bills for growing our local economy &amp; supporting small &amp; family farms is the #FarmBill. I also know the crisis that our farmers face every day. Farms are closing, families are out of work, &amp; people feel betrayed.
On #IDAHOT -  and every day -  I'm proud to stand up against hate and celebrate diversity. https://t.co/opojz84yFp
We need to come together and demand a better Farm Bill that works for Wisconsin farmers, families, and communities. #FarmBill https://t.co/K1mARsipkX
Wisconsin small businesses, schools and families depend on a free and open internet. Senate Democrats are moving one step closer on a vote to #SaveTheInternet. Proud to support a similar #NetNeutrality bill here in the House.

Time to stop the blame game that is taking place and focus on passing a bipartisan full-year budget.
We must work together to pass a bipartisan year-long budget and reopen the government immediately.
Shameful and unacceptable that a nation as great as ours has failed in the basic task of funding our government for a full year.
With #shutdown hours away, I am calling on the POTUS to ensure that our military &amp; VA have the resources they need to continue to do their job and provide essential services.   https://t.co/oaB2o9qXVh
Embarrassing that a nation as great as ours has resorted to funding our government for only weeks at a time. This is not the way to support our troops, veterans, seniors, or farmers. We must work together to pass a bipartisan year-long budget.
It is shameful that our President chooses to act beneath the dignity and respect of his office by belittling those who make our country strong. The Bible reminds us that we are all made out of the likeness and image of God.

#GOPTaxPlan sticks our children and grandchildren with $1.7 Trillion in debt while giving tax breaks to powerful special interests and the wealthy.

#AHCA is expected to kill 46,000 Wisconsin jobs by 2019. Western/Central WI cant afford a healthcare bill that would hurt our local economy.
