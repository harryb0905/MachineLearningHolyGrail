Yeah buddy! Nice work River Radamus! World Junior GS gold! 🥇🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Fantastic @BanskoWorldCup GS! Hard fought battle with @H_Kristoffersen taking the W! That thing looked like a burner! Wish we could have skied the SG but onto the next in @WC_Kvitfjell one of my favorite stops
The 2019/20 @spyderactive X @usskiteam gear is already available at https://t.co/lPYUMeZGmz 5% of sales go directly back to the @usskiteam
@MitchGunnphotos He’s a photographer kind of looks like me and we share the same birthday
Congrats River Radamus on winning SG gold at World Juniors! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@twchabot Mine was fine. I’m not sure. Is it still that way?
Be the first to have the OFFICIAL @spyderactive x @usskiteam 2019 Collection! (I don’t even have this stuff yet!) 5% of the sales go to support the @usskiteam #SpyderXUSST https://t.co/48Om2BHSjv
@megansharrod @nrarmour @MikaelaShiffrin @Are2019 I like @MikaelaShiffrin performance better because she didn’t beat my Utah Jazz 😂
This slalom in @Are2019 is tough! Over a minute on the flats, constantly working the ski has to be so tiring!!!!
4x Consecutive Slalom World Champ 🙌🙌🙌 congrats @MikaelaShiffrin impressive 💪🇺🇸🇺🇸💪
That was a great race to watch! Tight to the end! Congrats to @H_Kristoffersen on the win! @Are2019
Let’s go @ibeTommyFord @tedligety #RCS and Brian McLaughlin!  It’s go time 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 men’s GS about to go down @Are2019
Wild and windy in @Are2019 for the women’s GS! But nice work @MikaelaShiffrin on squeezing out a medal!
@TinaMaze we got on a plane and my daughter keeps asking for Anuk!!! 😂😂 she made an impression on her 😊
Thought I was clever prepping for a pie to the face but the cream still got on my shirt. Thanks guys #HappyBirthdaytoMe and thank you for all the birthday wishes 🙏🎉 https://t.co/s0OdOmkaPE
All I want for my birthday is the @utahjazz to beat the @warriors ##letsgojazz
@PLaunois Agreed it wasn’t full length slalom and the snow deteriorated quickly but to make for a more competitive race from two different disciplines I believe switching the start order would create for a better show/race
@AlastairClayton @sluhm @AndyDPhillips @DrBuhlerAMIT Obviously hard work has to be made as well. But there is a balance to everything and there is a lot you can’t control from impact from other players, rolled ankles, regular wear and tear. But shoot Stock a message and he will swear by it. Listen to his retirement speech.
@JuliaMancuso @usskiteam And it’s sad we don’t have a men’s SL team...😳
@sluhm @AndyDPhillips The Jazz with John and Karl were the least injured oldest team in the league. Once J &amp;K left they became the youngest most injured team in the league. When they left they also got rid of their chiro @DrBuhlerAMIT he is the connection to the longevity #wizard
Allow the DH run winner to start 1 instead of 30.  It will make it much more exciting when the SL guys come down later and reduce the gap or not, instead of watching guys lose time you watch guys gain time. I believe it will even the gap and make the event more interesting.
I believe Super Combined shouldn’t be eliminated, it just needs to be revised. It currently heavily favors the SL skiers with the shortened DH and usually full length SL. I think they should determine start position via the DH run. So instead of the reverse 30 format they need to
Let’s gooooooo #RCS in men’s Super Combi! Sitting 2nd after the DH!
It’s cool to see people breaking barriers and forging their own path! Congrats Antoinette “Toni” Harris @TeamToyota @Toyota https://t.co/TefrUB8OrV

@mickdorff @peterfoleyusa @jeff_archibald_ So fired up for you all 👊🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@Lockedonsports Hopefully they stay stunningly bad because that means bad prep and lack of respect, which leads to more continued dominance by @rudygobert27 and more winning by the @utahjazz !!! But even with good prep Rudy continues to dominate.
In 2007 I competed at my first World Champs in @are_destination and now 12 years later I’m headed back to @are2019 ! I’m honored to once again represent the US! https://t.co/gbQAVVYIew

I see the pollution accumulation in the valleys of the mountains, I see it’s effects on the people. If you don’t believe in climate change why not support clean air? @ProtectWinters
I’m utterly confused on people resistance to climate change saying it’s a money making scam. This is so far from the truth of the organizations I work with. This is something I push because I see first hand the drastic changes that have occurred over my career in the mountains.

Congrats to @erikguay on the fantastic career! It was an honor to stand on some podiums with you my friend.
@wyo1661 @aldoradamus The point is you don’t need all that gear. I didn’t have it until I was 16. Functioned with one pair for a while then one of GS and SL. You just have to learn to take care of your gear.
This is the first of its kind! FREE, avalanche education.  If you're planning on going in the back country this winter, please give this a watch!   https://t.co/dtCKhmKFcC
@aldoradamus Agreed! Tough to do with such a gear intensive sport but I believe it can be done or at least costs can be cut immensely. I have thought a lot about this and have some ideas 💡

Such a fantastic story! Ester Ledeka comes through with the win! People are trying to find reasons why but I simply saw she out skied the others. She skied dynamic, without panic, and took risks. BRAVO! #Olympics2018
@MsStockford Even if it is a money making scam, which I don’t think it is, wouldn’t you want to fight for clean air? Have you been to Santiago, SLC, LA, any of the major valley cities during an inversion when your lungs burn just breathing in the air? I would fight for that.

@844y A lot, we all burn a lot. But I actually move to Europe all winter and rent a home so I don’t have to fly back and forth. What needs to change are policies from above to help influence change across the board. We have the technology and resources to accomplish it.

@usskiteam Olympics Games?
Super cool of my childhood mountain sundanceresort to cheer on #TeamUSA at the beginning of the… https://t.co/KjCi3apDo8
@RedMenace219 I would say Kvitfjell. The snow is relatively similar and the way it stair steps down the mountain is similar. Not a lot of extended steep sections, just a lot of short ones. Which means mistakes are costly because there’s not a lot of places to regain speed.
Good luck to my #TeamToyota teammates at the Olympics! Wish I could have been there along side you 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/ouKPLa1uwF
Best of luck to my @spyderactive teammate @Jared_Goldberg during the upcoming games! #dorks https://t.co/W9AFsH7mfb

@Atomicpunk714 And one more thing, as skiers we have to speak up because we are the ones living in the snow seeing the repercussions
@Atomicpunk714 those goals and that direction is taking a 180 degree turn and the direction is changing back in the wrong direction.
@Atomicpunk714 around them changes. And I think the best way to do that is to create regulations and goals into changing our system but
@Atomicpunk714 the problem is asking everyone to completely change the way they live is impossible. People wont change unless the system
@Atomicpunk714 there is no sense in quitting. There is sense in adapting, creating and influencing change for the better.
@Atomicpunk714 I can do that along with all other skiers like yourself. Or we can push for reform and change the way energy is accessed.

@aetnablue I'm pretty the goggle were attached to their helmets and Luke and Han wore theirs over their helmets
@randomduck nope the freeskiers, just looks uncomfortable
I still don't understand the under the helmet goggle thing?
Thanks for all the BDAy wishes! It was a good one!
Really enjoying the team event! But seriously @usskiteam that's the best team we could muster? 1 slalom skier out of the 4? It is slalom
That was an incredible race to watch! Tons of fun and interesting not just because @tedligety won.
