And you know what else? That last jamoke in the White House for eight years didn‚Äôt do SHIT. Where was all the change? Let your vote speak
Generally I've kept my opinions to myself on Twitter but the older I get the more fuck it I get it
Ill run in 2020. Ill legalize and tax tf out of marijuana and take them skools and roads to the next level. 2nd world countries take note
Hell maybe I hate the fucker. I just don‚Äôt like hearing the same opinion every day on my computer and TV. That‚Äôs my point.
I dont give af if Trump is beezelbub himself. Ill make my decision off what I observe objectively. Not what every outlet tells me to think
Let those angry tweets rip. All I said was let the people decide. Not the grossly over liberal media. I don‚Äôt support anyone...yet
