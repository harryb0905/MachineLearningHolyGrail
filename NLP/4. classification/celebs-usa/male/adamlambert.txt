@islandgirljams Very
@iMenageTrois Yup. 😍
@asiladam No you will hear my solo music first. Also the @playmobil song isnt a pop song written by me, it’s a hilarious character song written by the creators for Emperor Maximus in the film. :)
@SwtJenn Nope
@MamieCole If and when, I’d like to originate a role. :)
@fsabaileyy It was low key but fun.
@jennamattel That first tour: the black leather and gold studded Versace jacket. That look was fun. (I was also a lot leaner 😢)
@didilynn2 No I think I’m still on California time but in London
@IadoIce New music : Biz deal is finally done. This means songs are being fast tracked to being finished. (Mixing /mastering). Stay tuned for more details. I swear I’m pushing!

Tune into the Kennedy Center Honors - 8pm ET/PT (7pm CST) on CBS. Catch me singing to @cher and w @cyndilauper https://t.co/i9VRmz3UBZ
@cherishmisha Exactly.
@Chaska09 Rebellion is far more than doing something to piss people off. It’s standing your ground based on personal Integrity and moral compass. It’s going against the grain because of what u believe in. Making people angry is just a byproduct
@MonaGigi1 This isn’t Hetero VS homo. Nope. This is me asking un woke straight folks to recognize that being Queer is a lot more than just the act of sex itself. Surely u get that? There are actually members of the LGBTQ community that may need the same reminder. Lol.
@GTK54 Yessir. Hence me describing it as “a struggle” amongst other things.
@casious1964 Well if it’s used in a condescending, diminishing way.
Went holiday party hopping in LA tonight and met some wonderful new people and got nostalgic with dear friends of the past . Laughs, love and drinks for all and to all a goodnight. ☃️
https://t.co/4LCQaLkNcT
Interesting https://t.co/6ght6AzmfG
@jbird1264 Interesting. I always just considered it as the person being a dick. But maybe it’s clinical.
@puk1969 HHah no I don’t think I fall into this category. HA.
Question: Is toxic narcissism considered a mental health issue?

#GunReformNow
While I’m at it: anyone who doesn’t support EQUAL rights for Trans, Gay, Lesbian, Bi etc or Marriage Equality, you should also unfollow me. This isn’t political, it’s Human.
Also I’m not suggesting it’s possible to make all guns vanish. (Although in theory, that would be great) - I’m speaking about better CONTROL. More limitations, licensing, &amp; regulations.
Anyone that supports the NRA can unfollow me now. This is beyond politics, it’s about life and death.
I’ve noticed a foolish argument : “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” That’s bullshit. If the person doesn’t have a killing weapon, victims wouldn’t die. Why continue to make it as easy as it is to get a gun? So u can fight fire w fire?. Less guns= less killing. Logic.
Heartbroken hearing about the loss of life in Thousand Oaks. Innocent young people who were robbed of life by a disturbed man with a gun. Why shouldn’t we as a nation do everything we can to prevent this? Why? There’s no excuse - not when so many are being murdered.
Was a pleasure to present best documentary at the  Hollywood Film Awards. Congrats to @danreynolds and company. (Suit: @dolcegabbana ) https://t.co/K8yOXyzJBD
Woah. Was just fully emotionally gutted by @BoyErased. Incredible cast, screenplay, direction.... and the TRUTH of it all. Such a brave, important film. Blown away. Can’t say enough....

@shellstar79 The runway show JUST happened. That’s not possible. I’ll have to see what they end up producing and selling. (Usually months later)
@perryslambert No hahha. Typical American. Hahah
@OfficiallKatha Very much! I think he’s one of the best male artists on the scene. He’s got a really cool voice and I really like the style of his music - it’s organic and simple- it allows his heart to shine.
@niecey_E We are still figuring that out. The stage is obviously going to be adjusted- it’s a different kind of space- a theatre vs an arena.
@zdunbea I’m friendly w @SashaAllenMusic who sings with them!!
@majbertka Maybe someday. There are a handful of cities I love. Montreal, Amsterdam, Barcelona....
@AmyF67 No. Lol. I am not sure he would understand. Dogs are so smell oriented.
@allievenable Hahah I should. I don’t always wanna be on Camera. Hahhaha.
@original_td No Reggae. (So far)
@JessicaParineet She’s so good. I was proud of her. I remember saying to her when I met her that she would do so well on the show. And loooook
@PinkKinkStyles Barefoot. It’s warm here in Dublin
@TiffanyStarr23 At a store called HLNR in West Hollywood. Not quite sure of the brand but it’s a one of a kind.

#RIPAVICII @Avicii https://t.co/LgT5zZRklY
RIP Tim. You were a brilliant composer and a gentle spirit. Fond memories of creating music w @Avicii and @nilerodgers-  https://t.co/AfCVbXlhQh
Not only that, but it was a masterclass in musical arrangement - the references weaved in, the nods, the BAND/Drumline .... @Beyonce .... the hair, the face, the styling those BOOTS. I can’t. #Beycheclla #gagged
.......but your hand is trembling and u can’t type... so then u giggle thru the tears and start doing a lot of smile-sighs like when you’re Peaking.... aaaaand then: https://t.co/yUOgszNw7z
Fuuuuuuuuh.... @Beyonce KILT IT. I wasn’t even there... the Coachella YouTube live was madness. She makes one want to just forget everything they knew about live performance, sit down, and take notes.... and weep openly. #takeustoschoolB

.@AmericanIdol finale memories. 9 years ago!!! https://t.co/xsy5oJWCBS
I’m so excited that all u fans out there have come along for this continual ride. I’m loving all the projects I am lucky enough to be apart of, and can’t wait to share them with you!!
One of the most exciting things about being an artist is exploration.  I am not the same person I was 8 years ago. My experiences and relationships have allowed me to grow. So logically, my art doesn’t stay the same, it evolves alongside me.
Excited to start this book!!! @Jakeshears #BoysKeepSwinging https://t.co/QRYtvHbLtU

Yay Emma Stone !
Apple TV why are u censoring language?

“@goldandleather: @adamlambert IS THE TWITTER PARTY OVER ALREADY?” Until I get some better questions! Lol

“@turtle_butt_: @adamlambert what is your ear size gauge?” Zero. ;)

@mindtrappa good point!
Reading lots of varied and interesting opinions back. Thanks for your insight guys! Fascinating discussion. ;)
No shade. I just wanna hear about music! Not be teased on weather someone MIGHT be bi curious or gay or straight. Who cares?! Lol
Anyone find it interesting how straight male Pop stars r pandering to gay audiences lately!? Should we be  flattered? Progress or strategy?

K I'm off the soapbox. I love us all
As an out and proud Gay man, I see LGBT culture appropriated all over the place! Catch phrases and all! Am I upset? No- I think it's fab.
If anyone takes offense- I'm sorry. Not ever my intention. But when did we all get so damn sensitive!? Life's too short! Have fun, be free
I'm an Idealist though.... That's my slant. ;) and MY opinion. Everyone has one.
If we focus on all our differences, we stay segregated. Right?
It's why we are the artists. We love to reference things we find beautiful or badass. The creative impulse is actually very pure.
There are times I forget (or want to) that there r others that aren't as integrated or progressive. Our experience isn't everyone else's.
I am so lucky to be part of a circle of fellow artists who are so open and full of love for our respective backgrounds and cultures.
@Whoisjohnnyrice @lovemrspencer backstage at HAIR http://t.co/Gv8b3lmapy
This whole cultural appropriation debate is so 20 years ago. Our cultures r BLENDING. A new, open minded/hearted generation is on the rise.

Goodnight loves! ;)
Genre is irrelevant. "@Shantilux: @adamlambert post-modern pop? post-modern rock? post-modern funk??”
What I CAN say about the album is that is a completely post-modern affair. Very sonically diverse and very honest.
@EricaKay83 breathe. ;)
So so so so true! "@purpIegirll: @adamlambert Aquarius Aries combo you really cant help it lol”
It's still cookin girl, I can't tell u what ingredients I'm using- you'll just have to wait to taste it when it's good n ready @Kalebert_
I'm honest to a fault sometimes- but it's my default. @caviar_diva
Thank u! @forever_music3
I also wanted to say how much I loved being on @GLEEonFOX this season. I learned so much &amp; had so much fun. Thanks to the cast and fans.
It ain't a DISABILITY!! It's just a disposition ya'll. the only thing that makes it "hard to deal with" is when folks be ignant bout it. Ha
Agreed! It's going really really well! "@sandraAML: @adamlambert enough about orientation.. LETS TALK ABOUT THE NEW ALBUM?? IM SO EXCITED"
Hahaha exactly. Same difference. "@DavidWayneConn: @adamlambert You're gay, I'm gay. Doesn't that mean we should date then? Haha”
I love all of u who get it. Thank u for your continued support. This is gonna be a great year!!!
I will not be defined or victimized by my orientation. Hallelooooooo!
“@JustAFanAL: @adamlambert I'm ready for #postgaygeneration”. Me too!!!! They're upon us!
"Adam, take it as a compliment, that they like u that much" Well if they do, they should realize it's sorta indirectly offensive. #realtalk
U know whats sorta annoying? When fans write "it's so sad he's gay"Why?Cuz if I was St8, then we could date? Sad? I love bein gay #oxymorons
Nope-- those ain't my lyrics. I use my iPad to write mine. Cool handwriting though.

Ok it's midnight here in LA. Gotta get to bed- I'm shooting more @GLEEonFOX early in the mornin.
I just read thru a bunch of ur tweets. It's so inspiring 2 have these forums w u. I'm impressed w all the intelligence I just witnessed. ;)
@GlitterBitch98 you're a smart girl! ;)
@GlitterBitch98 good point Meaghan. I wasn't looking at it that way. This is why it's good to ask questions- we can learn more.
I can't keep up w all the double standards &amp; contradictions. But as I said, it's just entertainment -ain't THAT deep. K I'll stop ranting.
Sometimes I wonder if some people just want something to bitch about. Lol.
@Queenofsomthin ur right. I am making broad statements. I've just noticed so many cases of people being offended by entertainment lately.
Entertainment isn't heart surgery. Why do so many onlookers take it so literally? so seriously? It's as if they're  forgetting its purpose.
As a society, are we getting more and more hyper-sensitive to every little trivial thing? How are we so easily "offended" these days. #chill

;) tweeting my stream of consciousness after being on set all day... Gettin heady. Time for bed. ;) goodnight Glamberts! Love u!
That's 1 of the differences tween being an artist or entertainer. 1 is more concerned with what others think. Neither r wrong- Just 2 paths
I def see myself in this character. In critics eyes I've oft missed the mark, but in my own world, I've had a great time playing dress up.
He's trying way too hard w his lewk. Its tacky and doesn't fit well. I think that's part of his charm- he is SO committed, w so much drive.
Many of u are wondering about Starchild's look. Think in some ways it's kind of a parody of some of my past fashion (steps and MISsteps) lol
@ladygaga hey diva I hope I did u proud! Thanks for writing such a badass tune.
