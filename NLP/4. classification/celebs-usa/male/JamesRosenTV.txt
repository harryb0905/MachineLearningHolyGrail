.OK my answer, as @MarianeMatera guessed and @MrDPAQ @SharpestJim agreed: @pinkfloyd. Embarrassing b/c it eschews diversity - they recorded next door to each other @AbbeyRoad! - but Floyd were the greatest sound wizards after @thebeatles. After that? @ChuckBerry, @billie_holliday
@SharpestJim Because we have no recordings of that older music, only composed sheet music.
@MarianeMatera Bam.
@CynicalMike @thebeatles With the Belmonts, yes? (Love their 1972 @TheGarden reunion album.)
.Loving all the replies! Interesting, too, that so far no one has named the band I would name.
Apropos of #YesterdayMovie, I have long asked: If all music were catastrophically erased from memory EXCEPT @thebeatles and one artist whose canon of work you could magically preserve, whom would you choose? My answer embarrasses me. Will give after some respond.
@easalter @BartonBishoff @thebeatles So we needn’t introduce into our critiques of the film every real-life factor which would render its premise untenable; rather, like most of not all art, it is best appreciated on its own terms. A documentary it isn’t. Love you, Bart! (What’s with the Russian?)
@easalter @BartonBishoff @thebeatles Based on the trailer, which is all I’ve seen, the film is an exercise in imagination, much like the song “Imagine.” Lennon only asked us to imagine a world with no countries, religions, etc. — not necessarily to build one.
So @SenTedCruz has proposed the #ELCHAPOAct, which would steer the estimated $14 billion in assets of #ElChapo to fund the border wall that @realDonaldTrump seeks. But what does @POTUS himself think? Watch my story for @WeAreSinclair: https://t.co/O4sNB6U52g via @YouTube
@ImJohnOHurley Hope you are well, my friend.
I love how #YesterdayMovie will allow us to re-experience @thebeatles as if they were brand new — the effect the songs have when played for the “first” time — but the trailer was too effective for me in projecting us into a world where no Beatles are alive; I wept.

@ColleenDoran I have great respect for Aparo. But as he aged, the volume of his output notwithstanding, he seemed to take less care with anatomy, shading. The Aparo of 1986 and beyond doesn’t compare to the Aparo of 1975. I made no representations as to his personality, kind or otherwise.
@frogchildren @PatrickZircher Bless you! Thanks so much.
@frogchildren @PatrickZircher Thank you! Can you provide a citation for Cooke's comment?
@PatrickZircher Please follow me back so I can DM you.
@PatrickZircher In my mind the best of the imitators, for lack of a better term, were Aparo and Sienkiewicz. The latter evolved into a multifaceted artist of staggering talent and range, an influence in his own right; Aparo, as he aged, got lazier. Hitch brings a strong dose of Neal.
@PatrickZircher Great example there.
@PatrickZircher How do you see that influence, that widespread imitation of his work, having played out? In what ways was it noticeable?
@PatrickZircher Interesting. I have told folks, including Neal, that he ruined comics for me, because after being exposed to his work, I couldn’t accept anyone else’s (most especially the imitators).
@PatrickZircher You said you can see the point -- what is the point? What do you think was meant by the original comment (i.e., that Neal ruined comics)?
@PatrickZircher Do you have any idea where the quote about Neal having ruined comics can be found? Or who said it?

@audrawilliams (cont’d) shocking politicization, had once, long prior, as a member of Buffalo Springfield, written the line: “I was raised on the praise of a fan/who said I upset her.” Now he was the balm, the safe choice, for the artist who had upset the fans.
@audrawilliams (cont’d) the next performer to take the stage was @Neilyoung, who tore through an amazing version of “All Along the Watchtower.” The crowd roared with approval. At the time it struck me that Neil, welcomed here as the familiar and welcomed alternative to Sinead’s (cont’d)
@audrawilliams I attended that concert. If memory serves, Sinead angrily spat out, a cappella, a brief excerpt of a @bobmarley song — the only non-@bobdylan song performed that night. After Kristofferson gently eased her off the stage (cont’d)

Hey @DCComics / @Marvel  fans...do you own these vintage fanzines? “Heritage” # 1, “IBID” # 20, “Voice of Comicdom” # 14, “Wonderful World of Comics” # 3, or “Comic Media News” (UK) # 40? DM me if you are willing to sell your copy or make scans of particular contents. Thank you!

@Wadded_Panties Thanks! Have been checking eBay for these items for several weeks without success; thus my resort to crowdsourcing on Twitter.
@Wadded_Panties Thanks — appreciate you responding. I had seen that. Alas it is only an ad for the fanzine, not the fanzine itself.

Hey @thebeatles channel on @SiriusXM, please tell Peter Asher he does great shows on “From Me To You,” but from me to you, Peter, “A Day in the Life” is an “A” song, not a “D” song. (See also: “A World Without Love,” not “World Wihout Love.”) #withlove

@jeffro418 Yes — will post here when I find it. He loved it.
&lt;— #CharlesKrauthammer absolutely :::loved::: my Howard Cosell impersonation! Made me do it every time I saw him, which was several days a week. Somewhere I have a copy of the caricature I drew of him, as FDR, which he also loved, and I will post it here when I find it.
#CharlesKrauthammer was more than just a brilliant analytical mind and portrait in physical courage. He was great fun to be around. His dry humor, perhaps partly to conserve energy, often played on what was left unsaid.  —&gt;

@MoralNecessity @ReneeCarrollAZ .The quote is dated 1981 — which began twenty-three days after John Lennon was assassinated.

Tonight on #SpecialReport @BretBaier @ 6p: @WhiteHouse and @GOP lawmakers respond to revelations about a top @FBI investigator removed from the #MuellerProbe for having sent texts critical of @realDonaldTrump. His role in the @HillaryClinton case is now under review by the OIG.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @WattersWorld @krauthammer And I hope he rejoins us soon!
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @WattersWorld @krauthammer I don’t even belong in the same grouping as Charles. He is truly a towering intellect.
@SteveWest_68 @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse That’s the third time you have tweeted something like that. Time to stop.
Join me with @ShannonBream on @foxnewsnight at 11p ET for the latest on the @GenFlynn plea deal, and how it could affect @realDonaldTrump and senior @WhiteHouse aides.
@hawkfan0607 @IngrahamAngle It is just the beginning. We'll see what Flynn has to say going forward.
@ILSRico @edhenry Coming from a guy so proud of his own sartorial splendor that he uses a photo of Al Pacino as his Twitter avi...
@OfficialJLD @Jeopardy This is assuredly not a Jeopardy question about nothing. But shouldn't there be a comma after "comedy"?
Join me on #IngrahamAngle @IngrahamAngle at 10:15p ET to see me report on the guilty plea of @GenFlynn in the #RussiaProbe. We'll hear from the attorney for @realDonaldTrump.
@Auburn_Mike43 Flynn has discredited himself. Star witnesses who have admitted lying to authorities and then start cooperating in hopes of leniency are always portrayed by opposing counsel as untrustworthy in their testimony.
@Auburn_Mike43 I didn’t try, nicely or otherwise, to do anything but present the facts
@BuckyThunder @MikeEmanuelFox @edhenry Maybe just rushed, as we all seem to be these days. Thanks for your kind words.
I'm on #TheStory tonight at 7:30p ET (@MelissaAFrancis sitting in for @marthamaccallum), reporting from the @WhiteHouse on the guilty plea by @GenFlynn. How did #TyCobb, the lawyer for @realDonaldTrump, respond?
@DavidPaul119 Yes

@OnlineGod123 @FoxNews .In fact, appropriate respect is paid when, on first reference to the chief executive, we say "President So-and-So," and then, on second reference, we use "Mister So-and-So." It has always been so (-and-so).
@murmiles @SpecialReport I squat corrected.
EXCLUSIVE: Aides to @realDonaldTrump, citing terrorism concerns, release “explosive” figures on chain migration from 2005-15, including an unprecedented country-by-country breakdown. 80k from Iran. Tune in to #SpecialReport with @BretBaier NOW to see my report.

@CaseyPcasey2 @rockhall Fine by me
@PatriotWaze @rockhall I’d rather see either of those acts than RunDMC, which truly has no place in the @rockhall. Thy belong in the @raphall.
With the untimely death of #DavidCassidy it would be timely for the @rockhall to reconsider its exclusion of him. You can’t sell as many singles, albums, concert tickets, magazines, posters, T-shirts, and other rockabilia as #DavidCassidy did and not be in the @rockhall.
David Cassidy RIP
@RitaKurth1 @BretBaier @AmbDennisRoss Yes she is
Tonight on #SpecialReport @BretBaier: A look back at 40 years ago this week, when the president of #Egypt, Anwar el-Sadat, took huge risks for peace and visited #Israel. Classic footage plus @AmbDennisRoss speaks, along w/ diplomats from both countries. What's it mean for today?
@crockpics I believe that photo was actually taken in Germany in 1966
@PaulPuckett_com Peter Pan out
@rkylesmith @Rand_Simberg @edhenry @BillClinton He did respond; he said his lawyer’s statement conveyed his sentiments. What he hasn’t done is face sustained questioning about it.
Ten minutes is the new twenty minutes.
@Rand_Simberg @rkylesmith @edhenry .@BillClinton stated in a news conference on February 24, 1999: “[M]y counsel has made a statement...and I have nothing to add to it.” The counsel had previously denied the allegation. That should meet any editorial standard for reporting that Mr. Clinton denied the allegation.
On #TheStory at 7p ET (@edhenry filling in for @marthamaccallum): Ex-friend of the Clintons @SenGillibrand, who occupies the Senate seat held by @HillaryClinton, now says @BillClinton should have resigned in 1998. The one and only @PhilippeReines weighs in after my report.
@MichaelPMulhall @nealadamsdotcom @USChamber .14-2 in strike-shortened 1981. Plus he was the epitome of class, style, grace, intelligence, and professionalism in a Big Apple wracked by default, lawlessness, and defeatism, the "ungovernable city." https://t.co/e6Jzh3ibeV
On #SpecialReport @BretBaier @ 6p: @SenGillibrand now says @BillClinton should have resigned amid the @MonicaLewinsky scandal and #JuanitaBroaddrick allegations. Reaction from @PhilippeReines and @DouglasESchoen proves swift, furious.
@jswriter65 @nealadamsdotcom @USChamber Well said!

@wtjahn @Mbacich_flyaBo @realDonaldTrump Well, I gave the White House an opportunity to make that point.
@TruPatriot16 @BretBaier I said nine accusers had lodged sexual misconduct allegations against the judge “...in varying forms and degrees.”
@leshadc @Mbacich_flyaBo Actually, no one else had asked the question I asked.
@JacobHeilbrunn @Mbacich_flyaBo As in marked by temerity?
@TxsleuthUSA Laura: The next time you are genuinely deserving of an apology from someone, I can assure you that you will feel terribly unsatisfied if all you receive is language like that which I employed in my predicate today. With that: Good day.
@bluesteel711 No, was just filling in.

@HireMeImFunny Believe it's "whoa."
@Mbacich_flyaBo If that were really a concern of mine, would I have dared to ask the question at all?
@TxsleuthUSA No, clarifying. Surely you know what an apology sounds like, yes?
@TxsleuthUSA I offered no apology.
@bcrabbe03 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Depends on what gets asked before me.
Ferdie Pacheco was unique and admirable for quitting the entourage of #MuhammadAli by 1978, pleading w/ #TheGreatest to stop fighting due to slurred speech and other evidence of brain injury. On the day of the @LarryHolmes75 fight, @nypost headline read: DOC TO ALI: DON'T FIGHT.

@lucephus2 @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump @StateDept @BonnieGlaser They are one of the indispensable ingredients, though. There’s usually more to report after a question has been answered, even when the answer is non-responsive.
@forestparkdavid @JaiceHarmon @MarkLandler @nytimes .We can say with a certainty usually reserved for mathematics that the world in which the leader of China answers a question from an American reporter (let alone one of the caliber of @MarkLandler) is a better world than one in which the leader of China takes no questions at all.

@TrumpinTheShark @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump @StateDept @BonnieGlaser I did. We will cover that, too. Hey -- we can cover more than one subject in an hour-long show! Imagine that!
@JW_Duvall @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump @StateDept @BonnieGlaser Do you assume that mine is the only story in the show?

@TravisChingo @briankilmeade Best of all, I was actually in the ballpark as to its correct meaning. :-)
@MACHTink @BretBaier @DimitriSimes @michaelauslin Smart journalists seldom make sweeping, all-encompassing statements (even there: I didn't say "never"). One might argue that Vietnam has been relatively successful in the last two decades but I am not an expert on the subject.

@1shaunanelson @jeffersonmorley @TimNaftali @KaiserD2 @jimhougan I noted in the personnel file that Jeff posted that JWM had a brother! Is he alive?
@CurtCarlson9 @BretBaier @TheDemocrats My problem was the kind of inadvertent error caused by rhyming similarity between words, not a deficiency in performing arithmetic.
@1shaunanelson @jeffersonmorley @TimNaftali @KaiserD2 @jimhougan Do you have a link to an obituary or a death notice?
@jeffersonmorley @TimNaftali @KaiserD2 @jimhougan Is he still alive?
@jeffersonmorley @TimNaftali @KaiserD2 @jimhougan .Thanks! Fleshes out JWM’s intel career, shows he was technologically advanced, and thus knew LOS tap on LFOB would not work. #SecretAgenda

@AndrewKrieger @jaketapper @jneutron1969 @seanhannity @donlemon @maddow I'm narrowly focused because my job requires it. Whatever I'd say about this matter would likely not affect my employer's finances.
@gabeschoenfeld Funny, no one at @HudsonInstitute, where I was invited by the president to speak just the other day, expressed that view.
@Husky1987 @jneutron1969 @jaketapper @seanhannity Yeah, not sure where along the line I lost myself. Maybe in the produce aisle?
@AndrewKrieger @jaketapper @jneutron1969 @seanhannity @donlemon @maddow .Not really. I'm more interested in domestic policy, foreign affairs, national security, and campaigns and elections.
@jaketapper @jneutron1969 @seanhannity .As I say, I really haven't followed it. I also don't follow "controversies" involving @donlemon or @maddow. I'm in the #newfacts business.
@RickySpanish_ @jneutron1969 @jaketapper @seanhannity @CNN .Suffice to say @jaketapper is a friend who has my respect and affection even when we disagree about X or Y or one of my opinion colleagues.
@RickySpanish_ @jneutron1969 @jaketapper @seanhannity .Also @JakeTapper, as a host on @CNN, enjoyed in 2013 greater latitude for self-expression than I do as a reporter subject to assignment.
@jneutron1969 @jaketapper @seanhannity .There is a big difference between unprecedented official DOJ action and critical commentary by Sean Hannity. Frankly I haven't followed it.

@diogeron @BretBaier @PaulManafort @GeorgePapa19 @realDonaldTrump Listen again. I said they lobbied for Ukrainian interests from 2006-15 and added the indictment said tax fraud continued through February.
@Cenepk10 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Read the indictment.
I'm on #SpecialReport @BretBaier @ 6p w/ with indictment of @PaulManafort and @GeorgePapa19 guilty plea, and meaning for @realDonaldTrump.
@maybe_heather .Not newsworthy. When a campaign says no to a foreign trip -- anywhere -- they don't want to signal that that country is unimportant.
@calvindanielsll @brianstelter The next sentence wasn't nearly as newsworthy.

@BarkingBarister @fancy_full @SandraSmithFox @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer Now go get your shine box. JK The hound is a friend of mine.
@evansiegfried Dubious, dubious.
@foppishopine @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox But you are right, I should have been clearer.
@foppishopine @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox Read Peter Savodnik's "The Interloper." Oswald's life was marked by exceptional rootlessness.
@fancy_full @SandraSmithFox @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer We were reporting on the president's weekend tweet and its implications.
@1FM_USA @AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox An honest reporter would be in a better position to report the "did and done" on the #JFKFiles after the documents have been released, yes?
I’m on @AmericaNewsroom with @BillHemmer and @SandraSmithFox NOW to report on what might be hidden in the #JFKFiles.

@peterkrupa @JPetrides Your comments are offensive, Peter.
@Mediaite .The over-the-top reply @SenJohnMcCain unleashed on my respected @FoxNews colleague @pdoocy entirely validated the question Peter posed.
@PaulineGoUSA @PNWJae @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews I used to listen to Bob Grant every now and then as a kid.
@ChicagoCurt23 I'm not in the condoning or being-bullied businesses. I report the news. Did it under Obama, doing it now, too.
@g_breost @FoxNewsSunday @WhiteHouse @FaceTheNation @FoxNews I didn't feel scooped. We had an exclusive interview with the national security adviser. Good for John, good for us.
@mroffman1 @FoxNewsSunday @WhiteHouse The sanctions measure the president signed in August, I believe. OFAC sometimes takes MONTHS to produce the fine print  that gives teeth.

@RV30B @RandyEBarnett We arrogant #@**s gotta stick together!
@leopardtwo @johngizzi @POTUS You keep misrepresenting things. I didn’t say I was upset about it; I asked if POTUS and HRM see it as having a positive strategic impact.
@JNass I get trolled because I am on TV for a living.
@Ocitman @ChrisMurphyCT I didn’t specify what it does.
@DryHumorBabe @POTUS How would you know what I think? I was the one posing the questions, not answering them.
@buffalloid @JeffGoldst That is high praise, Coley. Deep thanks.
@foolforfreedom @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews Hoping to achieve greatness one of these days, David; for now, though, I’ll settle for pretty good-ness.
@LMBigSur @FoxNewsSunday @WhiteHouse That is high praise. Thank you, Sur.
@Pulalupu @POTUS @MikeNeedham @FoxNewsSunday You saw the real @JamesRosenTV: doing his best to ask fair and tough questions of both sides.
@brandonlk ...back on his rhetoric, though.
@brandonlk You at can correct that it would have made a worthy follow-up. It also would have gotten you sixty seconds of contrary legalese. I did push
@SallyTreadwell @dancie_roberts @FoxNewsSunday Too kind, Sally. Thank you.
@JeffGoldst Quite
@scottEweinberg @Playboy You don’t even know me. But if you are adamant on the point I will unfollow you.

@JupiterStation @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews There is an abundance of evidence to the contrary, starting with my being a human...But thank you.

@MikeTobinFox @FoxNewsSunday @WhiteHouse Thanks Mike. Very kind of you. You have been doing great work under tough circumstances lately, as usual.
Deep thanks to Chris Wallace and the whole @FoxNewsSunday team for having me fill in. It was an honor. Re-airing at 2p/6p ET on @FoxNews.
@leopardtwo @POTUS I don’t follow your point.
@leopardtwo @POTUS Maybe there will be reaction at the next State Department briefing.
@leopardtwo @FoxNewsSunday @POTUS A. He is a head of state. B. I was trying to pose a broader Q.
@rcpierri I followed up with General McMaster more than once. Sorry you felt poorly served.
@Garbest Time constraints make it impossible to follow up every question. But he one you propose would have been a good one.
@jnelson2004 I corrected that on all subsequent pronunciations.
Honored to sit in for Chris Wallace on @FoxNewsSunday @ 9a. Our exclusive guest: @WhiteHouse national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster.

@24hrTVMazi @BretBaier @realDonaldTrump You regard a reference to the American right as pejorative? Because William F. Buckley used the term without apology. #lightenupfrancis
On #SpecialReport @BretBaier @ 6p: The pressures on @realDonaldTrump over the Iran deal, from the intl. community and the American right.
@AhaYouSay My point was that asked and instructed (not told, btw) were, in this case, nearly indistinguishable. Accuracy wasn’t compromised.
@AhaYouSay If you’re president and I’m vice president and you ask me to do something, should I consider compliance optional?
@katis_sophia @MollyLineFNC @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SenBobCorker @VP @49ers I presented a balanced report. I also read verbatim from the VP’s statement. Did you hear that part? Sorry balanced reporting bothers you.
@katis_sophia @MollyLineFNC @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SenBobCorker @VP @49ers Flap my mouth? How rude. I reported accurately that some critics see VP’s trip to the game as costly to taxpayers (flights, security, etc).

@Mundtana A compilation of what?
@dabeard @thebeatles @NRO Love the new title you created. But when you thought of that, David, you had the “Let It Be...Naked” version in mind, right? 😅😅
@KngFish The irony is I had in my bag a low-numbered White Album CD he could have signed. Later got Paul to sign it.
@rwerhle I might be an authority on @thebeatles, surely not # 1; and surely not an authoritarian on them, or any subject, except authoritarianism.

@USAFirst55 @ReaganWorld @CNN @PaulManafort @realDonaldTrump @BretBaier There were reportedly two periods of wiretapping, one in 2014, the other purportedly in 2016-17.

@Sikhealth @FoxNews You call me an "idiot" but can't spell Manafort? You can do better, Kathleen. And I'm sure your mother taught you finer manners.
@AMcCorm77526975 The literal content of the tweets is not vindicated. But if we construe it less narrowly, he's closer to it, as I said. What's not fair?
Does @CNN reporting @PaulManafort was wiretapped in 2016-17 at all validate @realDonaldTrump's wiretap tweets? #SpecialReport @BretBaier 6p.

@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense That was related to me by a credible and highly placed source as one of the problems the program was experiencing in terms of mismanagement.
@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense So I'd be curious if you could tell me what was "fake" in the news I reported. But I doubt you will. Did you even read the article?
@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense Moreover, I credited MAVNI as having had many success stories, and cited independent testing that showed MAVNI recruits outperforming peers.
@Sgt_Jackson1 @DeptofDefense Nothing I reported was untrue.
@AlexHortonTX @JournoGeoffZ Alex, I reported utterly neutrally on your contretemps with @NRA. Here, unprovoked and unsolicited, you appoint yourself critic of my work.
@GilbertIOmollo @HouseCracka Agreed. Only had 2:15 (long for TV) &amp; the problems are where the news is. Even so, I noted its soldiers often outperform non-MAVNI soldiers.
VIDEO: @DeptofDefense investigators see "security risks" in immigrant recruit program; lawmakers fear "infiltration" https://t.co/9CgM4MNPeS
@GilbertIOmollo @HouseCracka The program was created in the final weeks of the Bush-Cheney era, which I explicitly stated in my online article. Your beef is w/ DOD OIG.
@AlexHortonTX Actually, I noted that one such immigrant had been named the Army's Soldier of the Year for 2012.

@jpodhoretz As @PaulMcCartney has averred about Picasso, even his "worst" works have something unmistakably Picassoesque about them, and thus appealing.
@jpodhoretz None "unalloyedly." But "Mr. Moonlight," "Wild Honey Pie," and "Oh Woman, Oh Why" grate, as does "most of Lennon's "Some Time in NYC" LP.
@jpodhoretz Agreed, but "Imagine" is so not one of them.
@jpodhoretz I love that song, too; but you are a bad man.
@JayAlver @dcastillo82 @jpodhoretz "Imagine" was not socialist; it did not advocate for "no religion," etc., only asked that such be imagined: a thought exercise. cc: @yokoono
@jpodhoretz Is your dislike of the song solely related to the lyrics? What about the melody, instrumentation and vocal performance -- any good?

@meNmy3guys @jeffzeleny So wrong: It's not up to reporters to prove such claims are false; it's up to the claimant to prove it's true.

@cody_marts @marklevinshow A wiretapping claim against a fellow president shouldn't rest on a radio segment.
@dubenezic They weren't comfortable chairs. 😀
@LauraSmithDC @BretBaier @VP William has excellent taste! Grateful you watched.
@dubenezic My mother-in-law commented that we seemed very comfortable with each other! First met him when he was in the House.
@blackfishbird @Mediaite Very serious allegations, regardless of who is making them, should only be issued with a firm basis for them; yes.
@Dougcash @marklevinshow So you judge my entire career by one remark you didn't like.
@kevinjean69 I didn't say anything like that. Please re-watch the story.
@sandrapatriot I think I was respectful and I think @VP thought I was, too. He left encouraging me to be in further touch with him.
@JillRyanMSP Wasn't swiping @marklevinshow. I've guested on his show and appreciate what he does. But is he enough for that kind of claim?
Tune into #SpecialReport @BretBaier NOW to see me ask @VP about wiretapping claims, the "deep state," the Russians, #Obamacare, debt &amp; more.

@Resist_N0W @MichaelSmithII @SebGorka That's chief Washington correspondent, my anonymous friend.
For some reason @MichaelSSmithII didn't post his (unsolicited) DMs to me professing his admiration for @FoxNews and me. cc: @SebGorka https://t.co/2P9Dnu2jga
@jdgreenfield @MichaelSSmithII @SebGorka True: I don't claim to know where Smith was when he secretly taped or what the laws would be there.
@TrumpWhispers Your commitment to your own privacy, "John Q. Public," seems clear enough; others not entitled, I guess.
.@JamieRJN Actually, @RyanLizza did essential reporting on my case - which is why he should know the Gorka call is hardly an abuse of power.
@JudgeElihu @MichaelSSmithII @SebGorka Disappointed you can recognize a sandbagging when you see one. He extended the call just to provoke.
