Here is a little bit of good news on such a sad day...what an amazing gesture of kindness! https://t.co/iOvXGIaHsH
@weekendracer13 @pkligerman Yes. Was probably from when 6 breakchecked 24 mid race. That would bend it up.
@carolynmanno Also I agree with @pkligerman there is a difference. Lifting tires on entry is just wrecking door slamming is really agressive but different
@carolynmanno Would love to see #victorylap go through all the bumping and wrecking at the end to evaluate the difference the analyst see if any...
I really hate that for @chaseelliott He drove a good race. The win will come soon I’m sure.
@nora_albright @carolynmanno @NBCSN I totally agree with you but as they say; live by sword, die by the sword...
@carolynmanno @NBCSN Curious what analyst think if what the 24 did to 2 was different than what 11 did to 24? #victorylap

@DaveSkiba19 what did I miss?
@lyndarprather thank you
@StrattonBrett88 I hope so some day.
@oilcanmikey If ur  already in next round- other than win- whats the point? To your point &amp; to compound mine- i was NOT in the all star race

Nearly 2/3rds gone of the 110 laps. Yellow is out. BV is P6. Many people are going to have to stop under this caution.
After a stop under the green and a stop under the yellow for tires and adjustments BV rides P18 at lap 39 tryin to pick them off 1 by 1

@foxsports Every time has been snowing in Charlotte, I have been swimming in the ocean, riding bikes or dinning outside in 85* weather!!!
@foxsports The US National White Water Center in Charlotte is my favorite. I love being in nature but u get so much more paddle time there.
@foxsports Of all the things I've done in life, having blood clots has been unquestionably the scariest things I have ever gone through.
@foxsports You can visit http://t.co/sG9vFTE32h Thx to @JanssenUS for supporting Blood Clot Awareness Month! http://t.co/fpRJnMwaXT
@foxsports My own would have been fun but I was invited. My best man's wedding would have to be it. I was racing and therefor not invited!
@foxsports My best is cracking the 70's. My favorite place is likely my home corse, Trump Intl in Palm Beach, Doral in Miami or Miami Beach!
@foxsports To be honest I have no idea but was just informed that it is at my office! Which is where it should be! Took a while to get back.
@foxsports Hard to say exactly as I just love to travel one of my favs has always been Jackson Hole but living in Miami isn't so bad either!

Lap 155. Yellow for debris. Going to stay out and take the wave around. P18
1/3 of the way through the race @LVMotorSpeedway - BV is P11. Good car and some good pit strategy. More stops coming up soon
Great work by all. Happy with the qualifying effort for Sunday. @MWRteam @AaronsSports @toyotaracing

@SahSports4883 @Redbull ebay.
If you'll be in Las Vegas early for race weekend- step away from the tables on Thursday! I have an appearance in the NEON garage @ 415PM
Checkers. P25. Had a good car just had the tire issue. On to Las Vegas for BV and the @MWRteam @AaronsSports @toyotaracing group.
Two thirds of the way through and after a few stops to repair damage - BV is still diggin in p26.
After being in the free pass position- the right front tire let go. Team is doing their best to repair the right side damage.
A third of the way through the event- Brian is p18. Still needs some more rear grip to help get the throttle down on exit
@MouseTheMighty they actually made those? wow. is there an expiration date on that?
@marcroberge @crazycaseycat @sportiqe @nascar I'm in buddy! I say we start with 55! Need some OAR time soon. Hope all is well back home.

Lap 166… After green flag stop- P22.
"I dont know what you did but the car has seemed to come to life- we just need some track position.." up to P18
Restart after a regroup… four tires, fuel, adjstments… P26 at lap 114.
no right rear grip. Lap 101.. P25
Lap 86. Yellow. Staying out.
Two tires. Two cans (of fuel)… adjustment.. Restarting P14. Lap 77.
Lap 67 P11… little loose.

Lap 390. A yellow for the 11. P7 after the four tire stop. 107 to go.
Lap 364. Four tires. Right rear adjustment. Cycled back to 12th.

Halfway. We have fresher tires.  P7 and rolling..
Kevin Harvick- thank you for the help. Very nice move not to hold up a faster car. P7
Had a tire get away. Restarted 13th. Lotta time left.
55 takes P1. And the yellow comes out two laps later.

@bigmilkguy tryin man. everyone knows I want to run full time. its just a matter of some things falling into right place etc.

@krazbch1201 no worries. just trying to answer many people at once.
@starlagirl08 absolutely yes.
@jsoupzzz nothing dumb. just asked a LOT. much like when people ask mark whats his next race. he finally changed his icon to the schedule
@TheLeftTurn goood question. Always enjoyed a former sponsor of mine with the soju. Hows that? and Lemonade too with the Green bottle
@jsoupzzz dont know. its a thursday. Mark is.
@eddiemoore2 totally understand and appreciate it all. If you look through the timeline of "@"s theres the same question numerous times.
@lainey4261 not; its just hard to sort through and reply to every single one.
To answer the two questions I have been asked 1000 times- 1. The next race for me is at Watkins Glen and 2. Still working on 2013.
@crystie_th indeed
@chuddles39 yes. we have done VIR and Nashville a few times
GOOD! RT “@dustinlong: #NASCAR #IndyCar #NHRA #UFC … BREAKING: Amendment to ban military sports sponsorship will NOT pass in a close vote.”

@dustincary our own BLV Motorsports Dodge. Still sitting in Thomasville.
yes you were! RT “@DLandryUSA: @BrianLVickers I agree. I was part of Team Vickers then. US Army. #NASCAR”
Congress's arguing over money to support military while they spent 3MIL on (not guilty verdict) w/ steroids in baseball. It Isnt their job!
@Bagman70 in theory it is. It helps create awareness for the programs as well.
@mcshane2448 theres numbers to support that there are growing number of fans coming back to the tracks that they can reach. + its promotion
As someome who helped bring Army to #NASCAR years ago- really hope this amendment does NOT pass. We are all huge supporters of military!!

@lildee119 yes. thats a debate we have. Race updates etc. It seems to be acceptabled by many.
@jasongarner we try to keep it authentic as possible. The videos obviously are done by someone else who filed etc, buyt i know your point
@joshfahey been there; done that. thanks for your reply.
@chuckzcc I guess you follow them for a reason- that being information- right?
@joshfahey agree'd. (on the mix that is)
@KarenScottRadar that might be against the terms of service agreement box you check when you sign up?
@chuckzcc got it. sometimes dont want to cross the line in terms of debates and politics etc. Had that a few weeks ago.
@AustenR33 got it; we try with some of the photos and videos. I use instagram to post what I am doing away from the track.
@joshfahey that was the first one. It was a discussion about how to connect in a common way with people who follow/interact.
@thomasengrav @MercedesAMG @TommyKendall11 that would be an awesome venue for sure to run at.
@rpmfan43 keeping all options open man. cant rule anything in, or our right now.
Topic of conversation last night- what types of things do people want to see more of on Social Media pages or less of? Just curious..
