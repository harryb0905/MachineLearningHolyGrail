And my baby @MariahSk8rBell. I am so proud of the skater you are and are becoming. You remind me why I love to watch skating. Every year and every skate, you create such special moments for those who get to watch you. I love you 💕
Alysa Liu’s reaction to all her skates and her scores is so pure. I hope she continues to improve and stay healthy so that she gets to show the world how incredible she is. @bradie_tennell is so strong and I know she’ll bounce back and have a great second half of her year.

I love my skating family so much and am so grateful to everyone I have met. I have been and can’t wait to continue to cheer for everyone ON AND OFF the ice! I love you, guys.

@TheGabbieShow A queen
@TuktikLiza THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT. This is awful and uncalled for. In 2018 this kind of talk is UNACCEPTABLE. Our skating family is small and when we stand up for each other, we are better. You’re a champion ON and OFF the ice.

@NIVEAMENUSA @DannyAmendola Wolf-whisperer has been my nickname for YEARS already
@RochelleSilmon Thank you, baby 😘
My favorite thing about @DannyAmendola is that he shaves his legs so that other players on the field won’t tackle him by pulling his leg hair. SMART GUY!💥Join me and Danny as we tear down shaving walls with @NIVEAMENUSA. #baringiscaring #ad https://t.co/9kjtMNZOK3

@msherman8or @unqualified Upset that there were no leotards and no rhinestones but did love your T-shirt 💁🏼‍♂️
@cavaticat They reached out to my agent right after the Olympics. I held off on donating it until I was able to do it in person. It should be on display sometime next year 🙆🏼‍♂️
I officially donated my Olympic costume to the @smithsonian today. Pretty cool to soon have something on display in the American History Museum. Now, I just need to convince someone that they need to be next to the ruby slippers. https://t.co/YIgkSBcyXv

September 11th is a day I’ll never forget. I was at the rink getting ready to go school and watched as the second tower was hit. The way I saw people come together in the days that followed will always make me proud to be American.
@Jordan_Fisher @EpicGames @FortniteGame I’m JordanFisher.. guess you’ll have to be JordanFisher1
I am only 4 major awards from also being an #EGOT.. crazy when you think about it that way. #GlassHalfFull
@BorderProducer HAHA! I have a “nice things for a nice thing” section. Never have worn any of it.
My favorite thing to pack on trips are all the clothes I never wear at home and then find fun, flirty, and exciting ways to not wear them while I’m away
@Dance10Jenna I feel a lot of good things coming your way.

To clarify: This was a conversation I had in LA and not in Iowa where I had been all weekend. The Midwest is a lot of things but it is not the origin of this ted talk I was given.
@kennishaents YOU STILL BELIEVE IN THE MOON?! So good.
@Cosmopolitan Awful job at proving she’s not a robot. Still not convinced in the slightest.
Yesterday night I was talking with someone who explained to me that they’ve done extensive research on how the earth is actually flat, the moon is translucent, and we’ve been lied to. I was so tired the only words I could muster up were “You don’t say!”
@Tyler_Mitchell_ @Beyonce @voguemagazine KEEP CRYING. Well earned tears. Stunning pictures ❤️❤️❤️
@ckfockler I hope tookie clothespin has a good day.
@kathygriffin It’s so beautiful

@Grant_Hochstein I’ll never forget your AWESOME free skate at 2016 Worlds. A lot of hard work, I got to see first hand, coming together. Congrats on an incredible competitive career, my friend.
@louisvirtel And Pooh replies, “I’m 47.”
@NewFriendGen @ISU_Figure BAHAHAHA. You are flawless.
@jazzmynejay Who am I to argue with lesbians from the Midwest?
@PensRyourDaddy CALLED OUT
People who back into parking spaces as a first preference are not mentally stable
@ISU_Figure Daisuke could skate to me talking on the phone to my mom and it would be a masterpiece. CANT WAIT to see what he has in store.
@MaddiePoppe @Proactiv A face turning into the Rocky Mountains is the visual I needed.
@Tom_Bergeron @nopenother @iamValC @Jordan_Fisher @frankiemuniz YAYYY!! Thank you, Tom!!
@Tami_Allen2 ME AF
When you buy a new planner to write your schedule in, do you write out your first two months and then throw it out OR do you write out the first two months, not write in it for 10 months, and THEN throw it out?
I lost a contact earlier today and now one of my eyes is purely decorative
@DWTSJuniors @frankiemuniz @Jordan_Fisher 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I started working out again and I forgot what it was like to live in constant pain. Its sick and twisted but I missed it, like I also miss being able to walk up and down the stairs effortlessly but you can’t have it all.
@scotthoying Form pink to ink, a tale of missteps and triumphs  - title of my book
When I was in first grade, I almost won the spelling bee because I correctly spelled “pink” and then about 2 minutes later, I misspelled the winning word, “ink” and it haunts me to this day.
It’s so good to take a few deep sighs of relief after hearing that she’s okay. If you or a friend are struggling with addiction or depression, reach out, ask for help, let someone know you are struggling. There so so many resources and people who are out there to help you.
Thinking of and sending love to @ddlovato. Addiction is very real.
@neiiiil 🍽❤️🙌🏻
@BkButterfli Happy birthday from us XOXO
@BenSPLATT I’m coming over
“I’m walking around with sun glasses on right now because I don’t need people coming up to me. Not today folks.” said my mom on the phone with me while she also complained about how the sweet potatoes were stacked at the grocery store because she knocked them all over.
@CharlieBHealy No, you are.
I was working for @GMA at the ESPY’s and got the chance to interview the athletes on the red carpet. Also, @ciara said she would adopt me. I can’t believe my mom is such a good singer and has a new single out. https://t.co/CraHJuupda
@emm_nicolee Cheers!
My skating friend, @Tenis_Den, passed away today. He was so kind to everyone and a huge inspiration to me and so many other people. Murdered in the streets of Kazakhstan. Denis, thank you for showing us how to be a champion. Your time with us was way too short. Love you forever.
@tuna6788 @Bratz Oh bitch, I wish. Those dolls don’t have the funds because we let this album tank.
Trump is taking the word of a lying dictator over the word of US Intelligence only after placing blame on the US for its poor relationship with Russia. Trump is Putin’s puppet. https://t.co/LVkxIw5mHS

https://t.co/sfWw01lSUu I’m not saying we failed as a nation, but we we can do better. 13 years later I’m doing what I can to shed light. Educate yourself.
https://t.co/u5RxaanQcG I don’t care. Apparently, neither did the American people. Shameful.
https://t.co/psgvvzOkPd We had the nerve to let this flop?
To have a platform is a responsibility. I want to use mine to bring important issues to life like, did you know that the @Bratz dolls had an album out in 2005 filled with bops and we sat and did NOTHING. Did you even know they could sing? Probably not.
@misanadry @brazt I won’t sleep on this issue again

@CaseyOakes Wasn’t going to say it but now reconsidering.
@SBecky88 You’re more annoying than I could ever be
Heading to the #GLAADawards and I’ve got Britney Spears Instagram fashion shows on my mind.
Join me as I raise a glass with @KetelOne and celebrate the achievements of the LGBTQ community tonight at the #GLAADAwards. #ad https://t.co/m4n16alDlU

@jasonbskates @starsonice Missing the fam already!
My sister just told me that it’s exhausting being from our small town because she’s “wearing heels and a beret at 8am and nobody seems to care”
@wreckedbias97 @BTS_twt LOLOL!!! Go off sis
@CudiCropTop @saurabspins Worth it
@hannahmeiwrites I accept it too baby
@Ingersizzle @TonyRobbins Completely agree. GET A CLUE.
@RainbowDragonP Totally agree that that is also not right and also has NOTHING to do with this Tony Robbins video.
This woman stands a lot taller than Tony Robbins does. The #MeToo movement is important and I can’t imagine the strength it takes to speak out against an abuser. Tony, you are wrong. https://t.co/FVOM51kNQ6
@lordandtyler But like what a great idea!
First @starsonice show of this post Olympic tour tonight in Fort Myers! Ready for Orlando and Fort Lauderdale this weekend! Come and have a good time with us 🙆🏼‍♂️ - I also texted this pic to my coach (we all have the same coach) and he’s so cute I could die. https://t.co/ECfVo2JMYJ
@kathygriffin @guskenworthy @outmagazine ❤️❤️❤️ love you!
@CydZeigler @guskenworthy @outmagazine XOXOXO!!! So great to be able to chat ❤️❤️

@AnnaKendrick47 @mattie_rogers Lips are sealed, baby 😘
@AnnaKendrick47 @mattie_rogers Me either. These are made up scenarios I tell to seem relatable.
@mattie_rogers “Where I would said” - obviously I’m still not in a great place.
@mattie_rogers I have had a COMPLETE mental breakdown less than 10 minutes before going on a call where I would said “I’ve never felt better” before an event LOLOL.
@CharlieaWhite @Katyskates THANK YOU FOR FACT CHECKING
Being me is telling everyone your body is turning to mush and then giving an interview 5 minutes later saying “I’m in the best shape of my life.” Life is a rollercoaster.

In honor of the first @starsonice show this Friday, I thought it’d be appropriate to share my humble beginnings. A grow and glow, if you will. Thank you, @ELLEmagazine for showing the world my potential. (Also!! Come see the show!) https://t.co/FcAoq7hiML

Is Easter about @kennedyddoftx rising from the dead after a long night of hooking?
@ikebarinholtz Didn’t need to hear from her 4-now or 4-ever.
My mom and I are filming together this morning and while shes getting her makeup done I’ve heard her say “I just want a natural look” &amp; quickly escalate to “can you make my eyes look bigger? you know how to do that right?” in case you were wondering where I get my dramatic flair

My hidden talent is talking to a stranger on the phone for 10 minutes and them to respond “thank you, ma’am”
A typical day for me is being 10 minutes late to everything, avoiding all my text messages, and singing the chorus to “Hey Big Spender” to myself over and over until I go home, go to bed, and do it all again the next day.
We want to hear from you!  Please send a short (~5 sec) video to @starsonice and tell us what you love most about the Olympics.  Your video could be selected and featured in this year’s Stars On Ice “The Olympic Celebration” Tour. 😘😘
@USFigureSkating @nathanwchen I am crying. Yes yes yes.
@Official_NielE I love it too babe
@sugg_erin Yeah probs would still be fun

@ikebarinholtz @davidstassen Disregard what I’m tweeting to David, Ike. He needs this. I have no intention of listening to his band.
@davidstassen @ikebarinholtz @StacyIgel I’ve spent 28 years ignoring everything he’s had to say, why would I start listening now
The kids taking part in the #NationalSchoolWalkout make me so proud. Doesn’t matter how old you are, you can always stand up for what you think is right! IM WITH YOU GUYS ❤️🙋🏼‍♂️
@davidstassen Hey David, what’re the chances of getting the band back together?
Trying to find new music to skate to and I’ve been so busy that I’m considering just skating to my voice mails because it’s the only way I’ll listen to them.

@kelsorp_costa @NBCOlympics @Olympics Dead @ your beauty
When you medal at the Olympics, the USOC presents you with the Order of Ikkos (a medal for you to present to your coach). I consider Rafael, Derrick, Vera, and Nadia my family. They couldn’t be at the presentation so I changed it up and got to award this medal to my mom ❤️ https://t.co/94PnLtRSOj

I love being on Team USA and representing our country.  My teammates were there for me during my events, and now I NEED to be there for them. I look forward to being with them, and I’m very excited for the rest of the competition. Go Team USA!!!
I am flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent for them here in PyeongChang. Doing this would require me to leave Team USA and move out of the Olympic Village.  I don't want to do that so I had to declined the opportunity.
@guskenworthy @MattWilkas Wow okay i just whimpered to myself “so beautiful” 😭
@ThePerezHilton @PerezHilton @cocoperez OMG ME
I could feel you on the ice with me @britneyspears. I now have an OVERWHELMING desire to post Instagram fashion shows, google stock imagines of corn, and paint on the balcony of my dorm in the Olympic village. Thank you for not being in denial, LOVE YOU ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/CfeyGNecM3

@davidstassen @ikebarinholtz @mindykaling Actually, they have no idea what theyve signed up for. I’m currently in fight with the government. It’s them who now have full hands.
@davidstassen @ikebarinholtz @mindykaling Good bye, Dave. No matter what anyone says, I will miss you a lot. I’m new Dave now.
@ikebarinholtz @mindykaling Was Dave ever really “in” tbh?

@zachbraff Not at all. I can’t wait to go with you when you have this done!
FUN FACT: Being true to who you are and not giving a shit about what others think about you is an awesome and liberating thing whether you are gay or not - Sometimes we the gays need to be reminded more often but, LIKE, EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT, FOR REAL. JUST DO IT.
@michellevisage This is what the people deserve.
@andrewlcohn LOLOL 😂😂😂
To all those who tweet at me saying that they “hope I fail”, I have failed many times many times in my life. But more importantly, I’ve learned from every setback, proudly own up to my mistakes, grown from disappointments, and now I’m a glamazon bitch ready for the runway.

It took a BUNCH of selfless people to help me get here. They believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. So, thanks mom, coaches, friends, and people I have met along the way, for helping me achieve one of my dreams; being an Olympian 😊
I remember telling myself that I would make it through and I would be stronger. I promised I would work my hardest everyday and I would always strive to be my best.
A little over 5 years ago, I moved to California. I was broke AF, to the point where the little money I did have, I used to join the gym. I would steal all the apples they had out for all the gym members because sometimes I wouldn’t have enough $$$ for groceries.

@govincentzhou Omg now I’m crying
I am now heading to the gym to workout before I start my training day on the ice. The Olympics are less than 3 weeks away, and baby, a boy’s got to train 💪🏻😽
The VP has had little effect on my own life. I didn’t speak up for myself, I spoke up because it’s important to give a voice to those who feel they don’t have one.
I personally have nothing to say to Mike Pence. Given the chance to talk after the Olympics, I would want to bring with me people who’s lives have been hurt by legislation he has championed.
I will let the VP’s words speak for themselves. You can very easily find these quotes and more online. His position and intentions are clear. https://t.co/XmH0v9pqua
The VP’s press secretary issued a statement that what I said to  @usatodaysports has “no basis in fact” and that my “accusations are totally false”. Luckily, I brought #TheReceipts 🐸🍵
@laprrincesaa I’ll take it
@MatteoLane It’s a coming of age moment in a man’s life when he takes the first pluck.
Also, we (mostly me) like to talk about my eyebrows now but we DONT want to talk about WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN. This is so important. In 2008 I thought this was acceptable but I am a better person now. A true comeback story. Thank you. https://t.co/3r10R4DQ3M
@kyry5 Honestly I’m a work in progress
@TanikaLeeRice Like, I kind of want to go and check it out tbh
@cayhannah Baby, it’s a gold rush
To be fair the tone you’re taking with me sounds like your brows might not be great https://t.co/T9OsOubVcb

@TarahKayne LOL
@emmasuwanski WOW THIS IS IMPORTANT
@caroline4pres NO ONE.
This is me a year ago. I had a broken foot and a goal to be healthy &amp; skating better than before. Kind of unreal and feel so lucky have worked with such amazing people on this journey. YOU GUYS: WE CAN DO ANYTHING IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT 💪🏻😊 https://t.co/VjE5GEDye8

@AbbyCop Thanks for the facts
@KalenDaUnicorn Thank you, baby. Being gay is just a fun bonus.
@mirai_nagasu BAHAHA. I love us 🐄
@alexa_knierim @ChrisKnierim Honestly, same
@alexa_knierim You embody the parts of religion that I love. You treat others with kindness, compassion, and are always grateful for the people and things in your life. You are also a very great friend to all those in your life. Keep being you, plzzzzz ❤️
@LSpear37 @NBCOlympicTalk I have no major sponsors and I also coach and do choreography on the side. I’ve been bringing it the past 3 years with the exception of one bad skate. I’m so excited and grateful to compete in the Games. Thanks for messaging, babe.
I did an interview today where at the end of the interview the interviewer told me to “get my jush” at the Olympics. This is the future that liberals want.
@DanielModelMgmt I’m sorry if you think I’m being bitchy. My sense of humor is something that has helped me get through a lot of rough times. My experience of coming out really helped me feel more authentic when I would go out and compete and that’s why it’s been important for me to share.

@JoeJohnsonIce 😭😭😭 I’m just a normal boy doing normal things. Love you, JJ.
@salvat_re We did it, BB 💪🏻 Thank you XO
@sweinsto22 Shook
@VoyseUvReezun My sexuality doesn’t define me just as being an Olympian doesn’t define me. It’s part of who I am. What defines me is my character: the way I treat those around me, the way I treat myself, and my work ethic.
While you may not be SHOCKED that I am gay (surprise💁🏼‍♂️), I hope it helps a young girl or boy who doesn’t feel like they belong (like I once did) and lets them know it’s awesome to be yourself. You can do ANYTHING if you work hard.
LBGTQ ppl are still targeted in hate crimes, sent to concentration camps, are asked about their “lifestyle”, and questioned about the bathroom they use. So, until that stops, it’s important to be “out” and visible.
I am so excited to be going to my first Olympics in a few weeks. Being the first out🏳️‍🌈 male selected to represent the 🇺🇸 at a Winter Olympic Games is awesome. https://t.co/HpSHUr4uvP

@rockerskating OMG Jackie! Why are you so smart?
@taiskates @SkatingLesson I AM ON YOUR SIDE, TAI. CLEAN YOUR DAMN BOOTS.
I was recently asked in an interview what its like to be a gay athlete in sports. I said that it’s exactly like being a straight athlete. Lots of hard work but usually done with better eye brows.
@BootlegSkating @LynnRutherford LOL AMAZE

This isn’t shade to the writer, but the article is shade to the athletes he’s written about.
@AshWagner2010 @JannyMedvedeva @espn 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻!!!
PS, This article is rough AF @espn
I think what makes ⛸ such an awesome sport is that the costumes are an expression of the ATHLETE wearing them. Whether simple or over the top, it’s all done while maintaining a heart rate of about 180bpm for 5 mins. https://t.co/SWp9CvgFLT
@AshWagner2010 @JannyMedvedeva @espn “Paul Lukas grew up next to a pond and loves to skate, although he does so with approximately zero artistry, personality or glamour.” - Couldn’t have said it better myself.
@ImAnAutumn Omg autumn gold would be a BEAUTIFUL paint color. Missed opportunity by your parents TBH.

I am so sad to hear about Yuzuru having to pull out of the competition tonight. Thinking of him and hope he has a speedy recovery.

@GraceEGold It takes a lot of courage to put yourself first. She is incredibly strong and this proves why she is and will always be successful.
@GraceEGold Gracie sharing her story gives voice to those who also struggle. She’s a role model to all who try and be the best versions of ourselves.
@GraceEGold In competitive sports, athletes are usually their own harshest critic. To take a step away from competition was surely a very hard decision.
@GraceEGold As hard as it is to deal with mental illness privately it takes great strength and bravery to share her struggles publicly

@JoeJohnsonIce https://t.co/68LmyhfInH
@JoeJohnsonIce and then a STAR was born
@ChronicPanes Thats why it's important to talk about. I agree that it shouldn't matter. But it sadly does.
@ChronicPanes Of course I shouldn't have to explain. But some people still will write to me and tell me I should kill myself bc I'm gay.
@ChronicPanes if there are other differences or social injustices you are passionate about, I would love to learn more
@ChronicPanes Being gay, I am obviously passionate about LGBT issues (which was the original intent of the thread)
@ChronicPanes Why not highlight certain ones?
@ChronicPanes bc I only had 140 characters to get a point across
@cousin_pj I KNOW BB.

@katherineisms @CharlieaWhite I am down for this ticket.
@bradyrippon @ravivullman Thanks bro. Love you
@gsfd57 @AuthenticChange I get it ALL from my mom ❤❤❤
@Cathysan No need apologize, boo. We cool ❤👫😎
Normalizing our differences will help us understand each other. It will help us to realized that we all aren't that different after all.
I say, expose your kids to as many different people as possible. Most people who are intolerant are that way bc "different" scares them.
When kids are exposed to ppl that are trans, gay, Muslim, Christian, you teach them that no matter the differences, they are just like them
Athletes, actors, or people with some celebrity "come out" because we want it to be NORMAL to just be who you authentically are.
It wasn't too long ago that people were uncomfortable seeing a white person kiss a black person.
When I got older, I was finally met other gay people and realized there was nothing weird about it. I was still "normal" and wasn't broken.
I felt being gay/kissing another boy would make other people so uncomfortable that I told myself those feeling would be my secret forever
Their reaction STUCK with me. I felt so uncomfortable that the people I had crushes on were boys. (hi Phil of the future, call me)
I remember the first time I saw 2 guys kissing on TV. I was shocked. Those I saw it with all said "Ew! 2 boys kissing is disgusting."
To all those parents out there that are so shook that @Disney aired its first gay kiss, I have something to say to you.
the future liberals want https://t.co/wNVSz1fWxO

@rossminer @caroline4pres AHHH SCREAMING LOOOL
I finished my season (no fainting) with Mike's Collectables (my teams name) and retired from baseball at 7 years old.
She told me I'd be in big trouble if I fainted. I thought it was rude 2be punished for a faux medical condition I have complete control over
I asked my mom "what do ppl look like when they faint" so I could "faint" in the outfield and not have to play baseball. https://t.co/x1mtJiINZS

But I love @lyft bc you can tip the driver after. Not on uber!! If I could give uber a tip now it would be: GET SMART. STOP TRIPPIN.
One night I order 3 Ubers in a row and then just got in a @lyft that one of my friends ordered. This led to my banishment.
To everyone deleting their @Uber account: I've been BANNED from uber for 2 years now. BUT IF I HAD IT, I WOULD DELETE IT AGAIN.
