Pick a fight, lose the fight, shoot and kill winner, walk. what am I missing?
Where do they really celebrate the running of the bulls other than Pamplona? Calgary, Alberta. Stampede week. #bizzaro
@Cakes506 Love to surf. May not be time because we are playing Pittsburgh the night before. :( maybe early Monday session
I was in northern Idaho and flew home to LA for flight to @3eb show in Calgary.....which was about 300 miles away. #drummers
Just found out what that tiny arrow next to the gas pump icon in dashboards refers to (sound of head exploding).
@RobertScelzo eh. No hard feelings. @lakers don't need to sign a new second or third best player.  need a top dog.
@Kryzreid @ifightthedead 🙊
@CoiaNY uhhhhh...no
@JaimeH825 @bazecraze Haha
@RobertScelzo and then he hits a three

@timseymour Signs signs everywhere there's signs. Haha
@WillOswald33 Look at this guy!
@RobertScelzo nooooo!  Beibs will cancel concerts!!
@ENC_KB @JimmyTraina Wait, who is Flo Rida then??
I'm a sucker for post game sportsmanship. Great series from Heat and Pacers
@RobertScelzo Not a beileber????
Was just coming around to accepting a Miami Heat victory when I see Beiber courtside with a Heat hat and covered in gold. 🙈
@SeaHulkNation bring the supersonics back and we are there.
@BrianKellyBK @GuyAdami haha. Obviously we can use the help :)
@akaTheBirdman tisk tisk

New Daft Punk is a straight up late 70's disco record including using same musicians. @nilerodgers #johnJRrobinson #imeanthatasacompliment
@maxthephotog it's probably wounded with combo of creativity and degree of difficulty.  Plus I always lover sneaking brushes on a track.

Sea urchin in the big toe. Ouch. soak in vinegar and baking powder or pee on it like the locals...#yourchoice

@RobertScelzo Blessing or a curse?
Coach_D_Antoni at least you have training camp next year to finally teach the @Lakers exactly the system they won't run. #countonfutility
@Ianaki doubt that, more for acoustic performance.  Its a gift from our biggest indonesian fan.
@aidenscott @SammyBaybeex3 depends what you are into. (I agree)
Thought the @Lakers might steal one in San Antonio last night. #untruestatement #lyingfornoreason
@NickDoIt it's some street party
@NickDoIt yes sir!
@Cheif__Keith Dubs. From Bay Area. Should be very entertaining basketball.

Luke Hancock is out of his mind.
Tiniest dude on floor is dominating. incredible.
About to start NCAA men's basketball championship game. Best sporting event on TV?
@Cwints they play nasty. Loved seeing @SkyDigg4 mutter "bitch" after someone tried to rip her face off. men wouldn't last 10 minutes.
@Cwints I do actually like watching the game be played largely on the floor.
@Ryan_Malloy21 yes.  Providence on the 19th of this month.
Shouldn't there be male cheerleaders for women's college basketball? #gobears

Ohhhh to watch the sucky sucky @lakers or not....
@TheIronistIX it's tough.  have you ever walked a trapeze wire between tall buildings?
JT and Fallon get the credit for 'history of rap' skit but I bet @questlove is the #mastermind
@JasonHydra @HydraMelody I didn't. How'd it go?
NCAA basketball announcer informs that "shooting will be key to the game".  #enlightening

@RobertScelzo I have no idea. kobe's a generational player. Jordan will always be best in that comparison.
@ESPNChrisPalmer MJ's 6 finals MVP's vs Kobe's 2 or possibly 3.  MJ more dominant champion. Indisputable and I am huge Laker fan.
@TrishSue1 no food pics but great meal last night
@Shimmarify Indonesia as well and others. Hope to play there again soon!
