3/3 What is the message athletes are sending? The same one veterans made when they protested during the Vietnam War. Not that they don‚Äôt love their country, but that the country needs to be reminded to live up to their promises of equality for all.  https://t.co/Fi4vnJ0if4
2/3 NFL owners are within their rights to require players to stand. That‚Äôs what makes taking a knee such a powerful statement: the player doing so believes the message is worth the risk of punishment.
1/3 NFL owners meeting to discuss, in part, whether players should be forced to stand during the national anthem. NY Giants owner John McNair says the games are ‚Äúnot the place for political statements.‚Äù Playing the national anthem is in itself a political statement.

When I look at Emma Gonzalez (@Emma4Change) and her fellow Parkland social justice warriors, I feel the spirit of Dr. King, Medgar Evers, Rosa Parks, and all the others who stood bravely for what was right in the face of so many who want to continue what is wrong.
2/2   The only relevant issue in the Stormy Daniels case is whether there was an illegal campaign contribution in paying her hush money. So many lessons they should have learned from history, particularly Watergate: it‚Äôs never the crime that gets you, it‚Äôs the cover-up.
1/2   The Stormy Daniels affair is about consensual sex. Our moral outrage should focus on the women who didn‚Äôt give consent. The first makes him a lying philanderer. The second makes him a lying criminal.

2 of 2:  Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Panadive addressed the depleted fans, saying he supported peaceful protest and vowed to work hard within the community to prevent this from happening again. Great example of sports leadership. NFL take note.  https://t.co/h36MLeOiuP
1 of 2: Unarmed black man Stehon Clark shot 20 times by Sacramento police. Protesters delaying the start of the Kings-Hawks game sends a powerful message that Americans will not be distracted from this injustice. Where‚Äôs the outrage from national politicians?
@randle_chase1 Hey Randy, it‚Äôs the Cap. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: Last night sure made history. Villanova showed their experience playing great on both ends.  They put ‚ÄòBama on their heels. #ad
@BloodyHoof Hey Tom, it‚Äôs The Cap. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed. The 2nd round is underway. Nova‚Äôs looking cold from beyond the arc, but still up by 3. Bama's definitely got something to prove, so they gotta stay sharp. #ad
@los_mets Hey, it's Kareem. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: 13th seed Marshall shocks Wichita St. 81-75. Texas is up double digits over Nevada - possible upset brewing? Every team is playing their heart out. Tough to pick a favorite. #ad
@Haydonstewart Hey Haydon, it‚Äôs the Cap. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: It‚Äôs been an exciting start. No. 13 Buffalo upset ‚ÄòZona. Loyola-Chicago won on a 3PT buzzer beater. And Marshall upset Wichita St with grinding defense and good foul shooting. #ad
@Dchiocca Hey, Cap here. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: Marshall is hanging tough. Down 3 in the 2nd. NC down 5 early. We'll see how long that lasts. And Cincy is getting after it on the offensive boards and making second chance shots. 39-32 Cincy. #ad
@Faith_Kalisa Hey Faith, of course. I‚Äôm here with @Verizon to fill you in: Cincy‚Äôs on fire - up by 5 at the half. They‚Äôre hitting outside shots and looking tough on D. Georgia St. won't keep up if they can't hit shots in the paint. #ad
@RYDER Hey, it‚Äôs The Cap. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: Purdue is closing out a big win. Wichita St. has regained the lead. And Cincy is looking good, playing tough D and hitting the 3. #ad
@at_H2O_15 @verizon I learned as a player never to look too far ahead. One game at a time!
@dcwizkids Hey Laurence, it‚Äôs Kareem. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: A&amp;M is ready to put this one away. Marshall is hanging tough with Wichita State. And Georgia State is off to a hot start against Cincy. #ad
@at_H2O_15 Hey Hayden, it‚Äôs Kareem. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: CSUF can‚Äôt deal with Purdue‚Äôs size. Marshall is trying to end Wichita St's run. And it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess who will win this Providence/Texas A&amp;M game. #ad
@Like_Mike_72 Hey, it‚Äôs The Cap. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: Providence and Texas A&amp;M might come down to the wire. I‚Äôm expecting Purdue to win this, they‚Äôre getting good defensive plays and creating turnovers. And Marshall has upset fever. #ad
@AlexLorenz Hey Alex, it‚Äôs The Cap. @Verizon asked me to fill you in on what you missed: Purdue is dominating in the paint. Fullerton needs to hit the outside shots if they want to stay in it. Both games are neck-and-neck, which will make for an exciting 2nd half. #ad
@iQ_Dylan @ATT Hey, it‚Äôs Kareem. @Verizon has asked me to fill you in on what you missed: Day 2 is officially underway in Charlotte. After A&amp;M went 0/12, things are heating up. The first team to get hot will run with it.
@ChanoBuentello @sprint Hey, it‚Äôs Kareem. @Verizon has asked me to fill you in on what you missed: There‚Äôs a bad case of nerves in Charlotte. A&amp;M started off going 0/12. Score is 18-15. It‚Äôs a close one!

My thoughts about Dwight Howard http://t.co/24zbGHYbOi
Howard is an example of the fact that potential-has-a-shelf-life. Laker fans, be patient, allow Mitch &amp; Co. to work the free agent market.
Who's been watching the @Dodgers ... Puig is awesome. He has a special energy &amp; brings fresh new talent.
Recalling all those summer time pickup games where I spent many hrs of my summers playing ball in the parks and school grounds in NY.
@LAClippers made a great move getting Doc... Now we will see who got the better deal.
Thank you @UCLABaseball for giving me the baseball fix I needed!!! Congrats on a heartfelt win! #Bruins #UCLA
Read "Little Green" by #WalterMosely set in LA at the time I attended UCLA, the settings (W. Hollywood hippie scene) brought back memories.
Now that basketball season is over, what sports/teams will you be watching? For me, I will be keeping up with the @Dodgers
Congrats @MiamiHEAT &amp; well deserved. U depended as much on ur heart &amp; resilience than talent &amp; athleticism to win it. Enjoy the celebration.

Its always a pleasure 2 C someone whose had 2 deal with alot of criticism, handle it in a classy way, and come out on top. Congrats Lebron!
Miami's maturity &amp; teamwork were too much for the Thunder. I am sure The Thunder will be back next year but this was Miami's year.
Lebron James matured into the leader that the Heat needed to go all the way and I tip my hat to Lebron ! His critics have nothing left 2 say

Gotta run but will talk to you all on CNN tomorrow @ 9:30 AM PST and you'll hear my insights on the #NBA Lockout.
I know better than try to explain Ron Artest to anyone. I just think its great he is channeling his energy in such a positive way !
@niickyrozay 9:30 AM PST which means LA Time
I found out something hilarious last night that surprised me. Ron Artest is going to be at the Improv in Hollywood on July 8th and 9th.
Tomorrow @ 9:30 AM on CNN I am going to talk about what the players and owners need to do in order to do to reach a reasonable compromise.
@PapoBasquete Brazil has great basketball fans and they are starting to send very capable players to the NBA
@Pablobrackins the Lockout might prove to be something that kills the season - theres no telling
@Jose_LL_00 Being able to C the other sides valid points makes compromise possible. So we'll see how sincere the people involved really are.
@owen_then Love you fans Asia your the best thanks for following me !
@PapoBasquete I am pretty sure this will end up on the web because I have some interesting insights
@MacMane_SSO No I didn't we never had any cause to go the brink of either lockout or a strike. Back then we always worked it out
Will be talking in-depth about the NBA Lockout tomorrow morning on CNN @ 9:30 AM PST - tune in to hear some of my insights. @KAJ33
I think the Lockouts a classic example of people arguing how 2 split up a wonderful pie.Its very difficult for either side not to get greedy
@rjzapanta24 Hey what's up Rjzapanta24... thanks for following me on Twitter
Will be going on @CNN tomorrow @ 9:30 AM to speak about the #NBA Lockout - You might want to tune in. #KAJ33
Here is my thought for today. I think Obama took a principle stand by challenging the Republican Congressional leaders & I agree wtih Obama.

Thanks for hanging gotta go 4 now. Make sure you check out my film On the Shoulders of Giants - watch it instantly on Netflix and comment
@dabigjoker No - to the contrary I think this will make them work harder for their paycheck and earn their raises
I don't want to say the players names who I think are overpaid but you fans know who they are ... because they consistently disapoint
@addicusbrown Well you know by now I only really talk when I have something important to say and I def have opinions
@dabigjoker I think the solution will probably be shorter term contracts 2-3 years
@brownebrowne15 Nobody wants the lockout but somethings gotta change
@bondosf loved Bonarroo got to go on stage w Bootsy Collins you should check out the pics I posted from the stage
@robbie_law I think players should get paid for their performance level like most jobs in America
@dabigjoker Free market of course but every job should have standards or else slackers rule.
@OGCirrobb 1985 in The "Gahden" against the Celtics of course
I am just speaking common sense about the lockout. I am not on either side but there are some issues that are obvious.
@Heatspeare I don't want to step in that pile. :)
Champions have always shown their greatness in every era. www.kareemabduljabbar.com/championshipseason
My opinion:Marginal players don't rate multi-million dollar salaries. There should be a standard performance level for the big bucks. #KAJ33
I think that some players are overpaid - like many guys that just ride the bench and contribute very little. #KAJ33
@allaboutfigures Jerry West is one for the ages ! He could play in any place - anytime. #KAJ33
I think the issue for the owners is revenue sharing because the small market franchises are all losing money- that's an owners issue
Regarding the potential NBA lockout what do you think the issues are that are most important ? KAJ33
Do you think today's players are worth the money they make? Find out what Bill Russell & Jerry Reinsdorf have to say. http://t.co/sgFWqhi

Shaq had a hell of a run. In his prime he was damn near unguardable. I wish him success & I'm sure we will c him on the tube soon! #KAJ33
@FoxxFiles If any organization feels that Shaq should get a statue so be it. Most people will agree that Shaq has been a dominant player.

I will be on ESPNs Mike & Mike in the Morning tomorrow AM talking about this issue. Tune in if you want more details. #KAJ33
Its not about a getting a statue because I'm over it - its about RESPECT!  Lakers have given me the absolute minimum of respect. #KAJ33
@EverythingLaker Should we mention the straw that broke the camels back ?
Lakers Fans are top shelf and I thank you for remembering my contributions as a player and as a coach. I love you all! #KAJ33
@heyAndrew What prompted me has been a steady diet of disrespect from the supposedly wonderful Laker family. see Sporting News for the story
@MovieViral A slight is a slight. There is no bitterness. Laker fans have always let me know that they appreciated me. That is sufficient.
@Doc_aka_UNBorn who knows when or if that day will come in my lifetime.
@lukehagfors No tears just an oppty to state how I feel about the way things are. Justice deferred is justice denied. #KAJ33
@heyAndrew No one hacked my account Andrew these are my feelings and they should be known. #KAJ33

@sabres916  Your right but there is principal involved so I can't ignore the situation any longer. #KAJ33
The only reason I endure is because of all the support I get from Laker fans everywhere I go. Thanks to all for your appreciation.  #KAJ33
Rumor has it that I will be getting a statue.  A caveat for all my fans-don't hold your breath. Lakers don't care about me. #KAJ33
Bill Russell is getting his statue after 40 years. Laker immortal Jerry West waited 37 years for his statue. My wait has only been 22 yrs.

This kind of game is the most emotional to experience. Amazing finish!
This will be a devastating event for the loser of this game
The concept of Killer instinct is still not something the Lakers have grasped yet
Defensive lapses are a killer
Laker fans must be disgusted when they watch their guys give up uncontested 3pt shots
Lakers have done a better job against the Suns bench this game.

Things are going the Lakers way .All they have to do is maintain their attitude.
Once you start kicking ass  you don't stop till the game is over.
This series may help the Lakers learn what "killer instinct" is all about.

The Suns will try to regroup and come back tough in the 2nd half.
The Lakers want to make the Suns play "catch up"
Too much Kobe!
It seems that the fans have arrived
This is the time for the Lakers to take over the game
The Lakers are starting to make a game of it.
The Lakers will have to play a very focused game. The Suns are ready.
The seats weren't full at tip off. What's up with that?
The Lakers don't have to force the physical play. No need to be over agressive
The Lakers lockerroom was quiet before game time. Could be a good sign.

@babyboomerbev huh? don't get it
@csungrad Your right about Fish, he's a class act. I used 2 hear things wrapped raound the N word from losers when we'd be on the road
Somebody in Utah will re-write Damn Yankees and name it Damn Lakers!
When I played against the Jazz they took us to 7 games in '88 but we won so I'm glad to see them still trailing behind the Lakers ..lol
Fish just got fouled - if he puts down his free throws it will be right in the face of all the cheap shot Jazz fans
thanks everyone for telling me about Twitvid.. I will be trying it out this week
re tweet:The Lakers have to keep the crowd out of the game. A 4 to 8 point run will quiet them  & stomp on the neck of the Jazz
The Lakers have to keep the crowd out of the game because a 4 to 8 point run will quiet them down & put a foot on the neck of the Jazz team
@kalalwan I think its inevitable. The Palestinians & Israelis have to find a way to communicate & live in peace.
@Kelvaan I think Dwight had a go to move that didn't require him dunking it would save him alot of wear & tear

I just saw Charles Barkley answer a fan live on tv - does anyone know how to do that on Twitter? I thought it was quite entertaining.
@TheBlender23 I think Phoenix will have the same problem as the Jazz in that they can't match the Lakers size in the paint
Everybody that has family members in the military are part of the glue that keeps our nation together. Hats off to all of them.
@TylerDurton Showtime vs. The Current Squad: Kobe gives any team a shot but the Showtime Team & Bench were superlative.. My vote is Showtime
@FritzPingol the low lifes in the stands that made reference to Dereks daughter's eye have about as much class as snot on a doornob!
how many military families do we have out there tonight? I've been thinking of you all how much you have given for us all.
@jacenallen my health is doing good. I am in remission and glad to still be here....
Jazz can't guard Pau in the post and Kobe on the outside simultaneously. The crowd looks like they are watching a funeral.
glad to see my Twitter fans are watching the game with me
Shannon Brown has played very good off of the bench along w the rest of the Lakers bench players
its the best Andrew can do playing hurt
Andrew is coming in for short periods of time & having a positive effect
The longer this round goes on the greater advantage the Lakers will have
Utah does not have the horses to get it done tonight. They are turning over the ball to much. I doubt they can take 4 straight
Lakers were very well prepared for this game -they are having a great defensive effort & their bench is doing a great job so far
Its Cap and I'm back to give you some play by plays tonight's game during the second half. I'll start a few off during the 2nd Quarter ..
I would expect the Lakers to win the first round. But they won't be able to put Oklahoma away until they start using their smarts..
The Lakers can succeed if they use their smarts & experience to overcome Oklahomas youth & enthusiasm
as he tries to overcome being double & tripled teamed. Oklahoma is focusing their defensive game on keeping the ball away from Pau & Andrew
Last nights game shows what happens when the Lakers revert to bad habits. The team does not do well when they stand around & watch Kobe

If you want to watch some of my favorite movies with me I will be hosting TCM Monday night 3/22 @ 8 pm - i picked 4 of my favorites
http://www.paniniamerica.net/videos.cfm?vid=181 I guess Kobe got one of my cards in his pack!
& this can translate into a team commitment to put their best effort on the court every night.Andrew Bynum has been putting up great numbers
The Lakers can fortunately gain their championship stride in a relatively easy manner. Each player must re-dedicate himself as an individual
that its a long season (82) games and its difficult to maintain the Championship focus for many players.
I'm sure that fans that follow the Lakers are concerned about the inconsistency's in their performances. This is probably due to the fact...
I will always think of Peter G when I repeat the lines "We have clearance, Clarence".  I send my condolences to his family & friends. KAJ33
http://twitpic.com/16pzwr - Ebony Magazine March 2010
need to split to catch a flight....Lakers came back to win this one tonight but their going to need to be consistent to win the Playoffs
Smith just shot the Nuggets out of the game
@JeffAntoine we all know that the refs don't always get it right but that doesn't take away from Artest doing a great job
Ron Artests defensive pressure finally got to Mello. Good job Ron!
@DJBiggcheeez Pau plays the game in a way that make sense to Pau & it has been very effective so I don't criticize him
@ChrisNOLADC point very well made
@KI6BJV true but in the context of the NBA there seems to be a correlation
@Ballerstweets I visited Chile in the early 1990's & the people there are very gracious & hospitable & I hope they recover soon
I think people w macho tattoos are trying to make a statement. Its not like everyone in the NBA has been in the Navy..
@NubianSage no need to apologize but whose winning the hockey game anyway?
@Belliwi Lakers vs. Denver right now
I think Pau not having tattoos is an expression of his confidence in his game in that he doesn't need 2 affirm his dominance w macho tattoos
@chuckiebtoo The Defense makes the difference
Nice drive by Lamar!
@_SJD_  I wish I had that opportunity b:c I have done it in the past
Mellos poor shooting is a direct result of Ron Artests defensive efforts in this game
@soulz2003 He might have a chance but we have to wait to see how the end of the season plays out
@pixxie13a I'm watching basketball today
Lakers have closed the gap by creating turnovers this quarter. If they can continue to defend this well they will have a great chance to win
@JayDel32 whoever is open on the Lakers has to have the confidence to take the shot - Kobe is getting doubled teamed
Lakers D is making a difference -
Carmelo looks like a sharp shooter
Artest is having a great defensive game guarding Mello
The Lakers need to be patient & work the ball inside where there size will make a difference
The Lakers are making good defensive plays these past couple of times down the court
What I just said was simple but knowing it and executing it are two different things.
Lakers need to get a good shot everytime down court & then play  tough defense at the other end
@fivepizme just needed a break for a while as I was dealing lots of other stuff
@Scootch1 Coach Donohue was a very serious Celtics fan & he always challenged us to have the ball find the open man when I was in HS
@lizzfilms I just spoke at the Cleveland Public Library  today. I;m heading to New Orleans next
Bynum needs to pay attention to what's going on. The challenge for him is to understand what is happening on all parts of the court
Carmelo  Anthony is one of the most consistent scorers in todays game & I enjoy watching him rise to the challenge every night
Ron Artests high school was La Salle Academy, which was my high schools rival
@marinevesms  beating the Boston Celtics June 1985
@kingrizza I def feel accomplished but there are other goals for me to attain
@Bake24 There were more tough guys in the league when I played bc the guys that were older than me had 2 grow up during the Depression & WW2
@rammerjammer74 my thought is that its too early to know what the post season will look like
@GAVETH23 Bynums health is more a question of him staying in shape & staying away from those awkward situations where he has gotten injured
@Ktwit23 right now I am trying to focus on making my documentary
@JoshWidmer When the Lakers don't have Kobe they are not as predictable as they r w/Kobe. That makes it more difficult 2 defend against them
@DaveAkaSuper Denver, San Antonio & Portland all have very good teams & they all would like to beat the Lakers
@theesweet23 I think Lakers have the  talent 2 beat the Nuggets. But the Nuggets are hungry & determined & that determination can overcome
@CYNTHIA_KENNER Ive been working very hard working on my documentary based on my book On the Shoulders of Giants
@nerditry I would recommend someone who wants 2 learn the disclipine of meditation learn yoga. I have never practiced transc. meditation
If the Lakers focus & commitment rises to the level of their talent they have a very good chance of doing very well in the post season.
The Lakers may b still thinking of last years success rather than focusing on their goals for this year.
@Vujachick the Lakers do not seem to play w a killer instinct on a steady basis.
Andrew Bynum is doing well and he has worked hard to learn to what he needs to learn to contribute to his team.
I'm doing well thanks for asking.
I'll be flipping between the Lakers game and the Olympics
Looks like Denver is giving the Lakers a real challenge today.. what would my fans like to ask me about today?
Its great to see a public library work so hard to make books & learning available to the community that it serves. Go Cleveland!

It really disheartened me to see the violence at Fort Hood. Muslims are not taught to behave like this.  #KAJ33

@mojave44 very well said - all the best to you!
Congrats to #Lamar Odom and Ms. #Kardashian on their pending nuptials!
@JackWIII my point is THAT Limbaugh is incorrect. He injected race into this
The reason I am speaking out against #Limbaugh is because concerned Americans should confront racist demagoguery from any source. KAJ33
@JackWIII dont get your point its incoherent
@Mutineer07 thats a hell of a statement!
@JonnySoul90210 I would love to go on DWTS but they tell me I'm the wrong size -
Its hard to imagine #Kathy Ireland losing any contest & I thought she looked great on the dance floor & I look forward to seeing her again!
Mr. Limbaugh has nostalgia for a time when whites would win every encounter with non-whites. The laws that made possible no longer exist.
I'm filming On the Shoulders @ the Armory in NYC .  I'll be out of pocket till tonight but then I will be back with more comments.
We all agree the incident was ugly but it had no racial context. There was no chorus of black voices saying right on.. as Limbaugh stated
http://bit.ly/2FPWxX
Why do you think Mr. Limbaugh has to blame this incident on issues of race? Lets start a discussion on this. I need to understand this.
Racial animosity was not the cause of the incident and I resent Mr. Limbaugh's laying the blame on President Obama.
Mr. Limbaugh feels that white kids are getting beat up because Obama is President & made the statement that this is Barack Obama's America
Due 2 the fact that the aggressor was black & the other kid seemed 2 have no skill in defending himself Rush Limbaugh makes an absurd remark
It's unfortunate to see two young people throwing blows on a school bus. American kids should be focused on learning not fighting. KAJ33
I was very disturbed when I became aware of #Rush Limbaugh's comments regarding a video of a violent incident between 2 kids on a school bus

@Wesley_Kaminsky It was a very fantastical view of WWII. Something I would expect from Quentin Tarantino.
@JohnWayneBro I said he's keeping his jumper as sharp as high E not E sharp
Today I was on #Rev. Al Sharpton's radio show. The Rev is a good man and is trying to keep the consciousness for social change alive @KAJ33
Wynton keeps his J (jumpshot) as sharp as his high E ! It was a pleasant & informing afternoon. We talked & shot hoops and a little jazz
I had a wonderful chat with my friend Wynton Marsalis who I interviewed for my documentary on jazz & basketball. Wynton has an excellent J!
If people want to find out what I am sitting on in terms of basketball knowledge maybe I'll get a shot at a head coaching position. @KAJ33
I would do a good job as a head coach if given the chance.  I'm absolutely sure of that. @KAJ33
I think my fans know that I am usually quiet unless I have something to say so I'm saying it.
@hnic1971 Now that's a statement I agree with.
I have not been given an opportunity as as a head coach so maybe a groundswell of support from my fans could open a door for me! @KAJ33
My experience in coaching has not allowed me 2 be a front runner but if someone would have the faith in me I am sure I could deliver. @KAJ33
I just read the ESPN story on who will replace Phil & I c that alot of u think I would be a good choice. I would have to agree with my fans
@SnertDog didn't catch this can you send me the link
Its really a crucial piece of legislation & Republicans seem determined 2 oppose it just because they resent Obama's approach to politics.
I am annoyed by the lies & distortion that people are using to oppose President Obamas' health care reform plan.
I'm in NYC shooting my documentary On the Shoulders of Giants. You may see me around town.
Vicks really seems to have learned his lesson and he has alot of talent & it would be a shame to completely remove football from his life.
I'm glad to see that Michael Vicks got the oppty to pay football again even though he was involved in a deplorable situation.
I think MLB needs 2 have a coherent public relations program 2 put this issue 2 rest so that the public knows whats up & who the culprits R.
@OptimusE24 People who appreciate combat sports enjoy the way that MMA pits components against each other. It requires versatility & skill

Ariza wanted "star money" now but he's only 23 &  hasn't shown consistency year in and year out.
If #Artest can handle his emotional issues he will be a great addition to the team.
I thought #Ariza was quick & stealthy and did amazing things & I'll miss him on the team
Artest is a formidable front line player but he is emotionally erratic so we'll see what happens.
Ariza was trying 2 get more money because this was his first outstanding year. Artest was willing to sign for the money Ariza turned down
my summer reading:The Biography of Satchel Paige- its very intstng because he pitched during the Harlem Renaissance & became a star athlete
Signing #Artest was a thumb in the eye of Trevor Ariza because Artest signed for the same amount of money that they offered to #Ariza.

#Phil Jackson has made his mark with class. KAJ33
#Pau is the "Maestro" because he can play the game in different styles.
#Laker fans get your #Skyhook Tshirts ready for the parade!  Available Exclusively @ www.kareemabduljabbar.com
If it keeps going like this, the #Magic can start getting their tennis racquets strung.
#Magic is dying by turnovers and missed freethrows
#Ariza is coming of age and proving himself to be a 'gamer'
@bumblebeenie #Skyhook Tshirts are available exclusively at  www.kareemabduljabbar.com
@RayBeckerman don't kid yourself, I'm a company man all the way
A little killer instinct doesn't hurt at all does it..!
the #Lakers are ba-ack! KAJ33
#Lamar Odom is a like a swiss army knife that just keeps unfolding KAJ33
# Lamar Odom is making layups in Dr. J style!
It is Lakers tradition to win crucial games sooner than later
Bynum hits hook on the baseline-that's my boy!
I'm impressed with Magics determination while trailing 3-1
Magic has had their run how will they do for the rest of the game?
Lakers are not that far off the pace ,they've taken Magics best effort.
Magic is excited Lakers are flat.Hopefully they have not begun to fight.
I think Lakers will rise to the occasion.
Will Lakers be too confident and take the victory for granted?
Will Magic be out of the game mentally & unable to compete?
Tonights issue: How will either team be affected by Friday's game?
Here is tonight's KTG: LA needs to rotate on ORL shooters tonight because they will be firing away or it will be loong night.
I just launched my new website: hope my fans will check it out www.kareemabduljabbar.com

@deanaontheradio see if you can resend it with the type not cutt off
@AnthonyCekay I have many favorite jazz heroes - I have them listed under Heroes on my website www.kareemabduljabbar.com
@HiCpunch I must take a moment on this. Please spell Bill Russell's name correctly he deserves the respect!
@lakandiwa Thanks so much for sending this I had not seen it! Wynton is one of my favorite people as well as one of my favorite musicians
My favorite player of all time is Bill Russell. I learned a lot from watching him. From the current lot, I enjoy watching Dwayne Wade play.
@PuertoRockin Milwaukee is always in my heart. Two of my top five Playoff memories were in Milwaukee.
Hope you fans will be joining me @ Hoopfest in Spokane, WA details at www.spokanehoopfest.net  or  http://twitpic.com/734n0

Congrats Derek on demonstrating the meaning of team effort!  You are very much the heart & soul of the Lakers. #@KAJ33
#Kareem Abdul-Jabbar giving props to Derek Fisher for  bringing it on game four!
Derek Fishers heroics made all us old timers smile!
It really made me feel good 2 c  Fisher redeem himself & prove his value 2 the team when people were talking about him being too old.
Don't forget  Fathers Day! the perfect gift- Skyhook Tshirt. www.kareemabduljabbar.com
Magic loses! In the words of the immortal Fat Domino  "Ain't that a Shame" http://bit.ly/19tA35
Fisher just proved that old school is cool
Lakers beat 8!!!
ka-PAU!!  Follow the bouncing ball!
Talk about daggers! That was one for the ages. Fisher was outstanding!
My song for tonight.. Could this be (Laker) "Magic?"
Refs have made it impossible to get a break
Pietrus is tonights X-factor
It seems that Magic can't foul!
Which team will give in to the pressure?
Pressure breaks pipes!
Lakers look like they've come to take one this evening.
An auspicious start!
What a turnaround...I think the Magic just got twitterpated!
What a turnaround!
Run Lakers,run!
Ariza & Bynum put up 15 of Lakers last 21 points..
Has the worm turned?
Lakers were down a dozen now up by one.. the "Dirty Dozen"  allow the Lakers to play better with a lead. I don't see the Magic joking now...
The Lakers are catching some breaks,it's making a difference.
Lakers are back in this one.
We'll see if the Lakers can focus for a complete half.
I've tried to work on Mbenga's offensive game, to smooth it out.
If they can't get moving it'll be a long night.
Laker offense is not getting it done.
Lakers are letting their emotions get the best of them.
Magic turnovers keeping Lakers in the game- Kobe has to take over
This has the feeling of a game that will go down to the wire.
Magic is not quite as hot as they were on Tuesday
@ggsexy21m LAL 15-  ORL 20
Lakers are committing too many unnecessary fouls
Mbenga will be able to give Lakers some quality relief minutes
Alston is shooting much better at home
Kobe must set the tone & be aggressive
Lakers continue to play  Defense effectively
Peitrus is in the game early to give Magic more offense.
Laker Defense is tough out of the gate.
A great defensive game by Lakers would end Magics hopes to take the series.
Do you think the Magic will continue to shoot like they did last game?
Tonights game will determine the length of this series. A Laker victory will mean a short series. A Magic victory will mean a 6 or 7 series

tonights KTG: Lakers frontline must not get outrebounded again
I was specifically drawing attention to what I felt Howard needed to learn so that his offense would be on the same level as his D.
I made statements about Dwight Howard when a reporter asked me 2 specifically critique his offensive game. It was not a put down!
"I can do more than stuff a ball through a hoop; my greatest asset  is my mind."  We can talk b-ball or we can talk about more...  KAJ33

Howard was able to get some good opportunities to score in the 2nd half
104 Lakers - 106 ORL
A musical thoughts for Laker fans "Turn out the lights, the party's over"
Magic looking for first Finals win (O-7)
Magic has not been able to put the game away
We can  tie the game with these free throws-go figure!
The Magic is having a special night shooting from the field.

shout out to Kathy Ireland @kathyireland- we've been great friends for a long time.
@heykim I never saw a tweet from Kathy
It's a miracle that the game is still this close
Lakers must get a better defensive effort this half
Magic is shooting 75%- Lakers can't let that continue
The ref just ignored a foul by Farmar on the break
@borbay Hey Coach Borbet Happy Retirement after 38 years...
@borbay Whats his name and retirement from where ? How long did he work at his job?
I just told Bynum to stay out of foul trouble
A very well played 1st quarter
The numbers don't lie.. then or now
At this pace Kobe could go for 60!!
Kobe is scoring at an unreal pace!!!
Both teams are playing well & executing their game plans.
@King_Zor why do you think I am the all-time leading scorer
the Magic aren't shoot well from the line
FYI..Spoke to Steve Nash for his Letterman gig before game
@King_Zor No one ever gave me a problem
Lakers are moving the ball effectively, a good sign!
The Lakers are in the game and not distracted!
I'm looking for Andrew to have a great game and quiet the crowd
of course I am at the game - do you think I would sit this one out
@The_Real_J definitely going to be at Hoopfest June 26-28 www.spokanehoopfest.net

Theme song for tonights game: "Taking Care of Business"
Like I said "Slippin in the back door!"
Who will be left standing?
My most memorable OT for me was Game 6 1974 vs Boston
If the Lakers win this one it will be "Slipping in the back door"
Magic has acheived their goal and made this a close contest.
Can Lakers pull ahead and stay ahead?
Tonites musical theme: Are the Lakers " Slipping into darkness?" War
Foul Trouble is no  good for the Lakers
This game will probably go down to the wire!

My top 5 Playoff Memories http://www.nba.com/2009/playoffs2009/06/06/kareem.memories/index.html
Keep smiling ! Fans r noticing that u look happy
Lakers have fouled too much this quarter
Magic is apparently unable to maintain the pace
Magic will be in trouble if the game turns into the Kobe show
Alston is doing Lakers a favor every time he shoots
@Justo1186 Skyhook is a shot while made while moving laterally, Jump Hook is a shot made while standing still on two legs. KAJ33
@ArmandoSez my best year was when I turned 40. I was playing my best ball that year

My top 5 Playoff Memories http://www.nba.com/2009/playoffs2009/06/06/kareem.memories/index.html
Here he goes again (Kobe)
Bynum will have to be careful on the defense. He gets called for cheap fouls
did you guys see my (KTG) Keys to the Game earlier?
Bynum is not shooting a Skyhook he is shooting a jump hook
@ItsGasolGood iPhone is what I use to Twitter
Andrew Bynum can take advantage in the paint
Lamar is looking good early in this game.
This game will be much closer than the last one.
Both teams are playing smart defense. It will much more difficult to take charge of this game.
Magic is playing well but Laker defense is meeting that challenge.
A B got caught reaching in on D.
Laker fans smell blood.
Lakers want to replay Fridays game.
Tonite we'll see how Magic responds to Fridays loss. What adjustments will they make.
Later I will let you know my top 5 Playoff memories
4th KTG: Lakers bigs take it to Dwight Again 5th KTG: Kobe getting teammates involved before taking over
3rd  KTG: Magic need to push the ball. Zero fastbreak pts in Game 1
Here's my 2nd KTG: Get Dwight Howard involved offensively
Keys to the Game: Tonights KTG: Magic must defend Lakers pick & roll better

AF 447 on Pietrus shoes is a nice touch in honor of airline victims
Lakers have kept Howard from dominating the  game
Magic will have to regroup after this loss
When I played I was of a mind that I wouldn't let my team lose...this is how Kobe is playing tonight.
Kobe's layup reminds me of me vs. the Celtics
that was the look of a champion
Kobe will not be denied tonight!
Orlando shooting 31 percent
Its that "Same Old Song" but a different meaning since you've been gone!
Pow..... Pau! The Lakers offense running on all cylinders....
Lakers passing is superb!
@THEGODofPOKER not only can I reply to you but I challenge you to compete with & against me....www.sportslegendschallenge.com
without inside game 3 pt shooters can't get off
Magic needs balanced scoring to take control of the game
Lakers are making Howard earn it at the free throw line
Big block by Bynum!
points in the paint are making the difference for the Lakers
@Catbird55 Obamas' speech was right on the money
@steeleaj  he has been taught
Lamar continues to pick  up where he left off in the  last series... X-factor
A. B. got his 3rd foul by reaching in.
Magic is having a hard time containing Kobe.
It will be a see-saw battle
Lamar this ones for you..... http://bit.ly/1RwRqS

Good sportsmanship should always be a part of your approach to the game. This is something every competitor should remember. KAJ33
@InsideHoops I'd probably have to say Bruce Lee. Hanging in Hong Kong with Bruce was awesome & a memory I will never forget. KAJ33
These are important lessons for someone who cannot avoid the glaring spotlight of leadership. Watch 4 my Keys to the Game on Thursday (KTG)
Sometimes its hard 2 understand your own shortcomings when all the media in the world tell u that you u r  royalty & u can walk on water.
I'm sure LeBron has learned an important lesson about sportsmanship from his teams loss in the Eastern Conference Finals. KAJ33
Youngsters should learn about sportsmanship as well as spectacular athletic ability when they watch LeBron play. KAJ33
LeBron probably is the most dominant player in the NBA.  However, his visibility means he has 2 handle disappointments w/more grace.

Tonights Quiz: Is Birdman an Eagle or  Turkey?
Denver is not showing much class
Kobe deserves an Oscar for his  performance !
Another dagger from #24!
Kobe & friends have an answer to every Nugget challenge!
Lakers are in the game at both ends of the court.
Now Playing: The Invisible Man - starring Carmelo Anthony
Walton strikes again!
Lakers are moving the ball like champs!
Denver  seems to be shooting itself in the foot
Re Martins last foul: "Stupid is as stupid does" Forrest Gump
Denver looks like they are in the "Land of the Lost"
Lakers will be hard to catch in the 4th quarter
Lakers defense continues to dominate  -the wagon is doing a great job off the bench - Walton x-factor in the 3rd
I think they should post a sign: Beach closed. Shark attack
Is George Karl like Robert Shaws character in Jaws or Quint who gets eaten @ end of movie?
Gasol is having another well balanced steady game
Bynum is pressing to much
Trevor needs to get under control & be patient
Sharks in the water. Denver "your going to need a bigger boat" do you fans know what movie that line was from?
A rare air ball from Kobe!
Does LA smell blood? Kobe looks like an alpha wolf leading the pack for a kill- Now is the time!
Lakers are in the drivers seat going into the 2nd half
@chavez_ws I'm happy that you recall them- they were great days
great stat: Lakers 29 final appearance - Nuggets 0
Only chance Denver has is Anthony or Billups to take over this game. Mello is only 3 of 10 - not looking good
Lakers offense was most dominating performance of the series if their defense can match this offense look out
Denver is starting to fade they will have to get it together at the half if they hope to get back in the game in the 2nd half
Kobe is El Fuego!
Nuggets are searching for answers. Lakers shooting 63%
Kobe is getting hot!!
Kobe is having a great night as a playmaker & leader
The Lakers have to instill doubt & cause the Nuggets to tighten up. Billups is the only player that has playoff experience
this part of the game is the part that Denver should use to make their move
10 different Lakers have scored tonight! Spreading the wealth!
Odom is being effective
The pace of this game will be a factor. Who will benefit from it?.
Denver will be at a disadvantage if they have to play "catch-up."
@ItsMeDStarr LA 25 Denver 20 2nd Q
LA is looking good, Denver must adjust to stop Ariza.
Denver must deal with him or he will break the game open
Ariza on fire!
Ariza is creating good situations for LA
Tough call
LA is playing a smart patient game
Anthony will have 2 be a factor for Denver 2 win.
LA is looking good out of the blocks!
L A is getting good looks at the hoop
Lakers have started out playing good defense in the paint
Which team will take control of the style & tempo of this game?
I'm sure the nuggets are primed 4 this one!.
Will the Lakers be able 2 be at their best in Denver?
@yhope143 I don't expect the Cav's are going to make it-@ this point  the Magic is in the drivers seat & I expect them to win @ home 2morrow

The Lakers playoff loss in Denver Monday night was only the 2nd time in franchise history. When was the 1st time the Lakers lost in Denver?
I did an interview on what is my favorite place is in the world - If you want to find out more:  www.myfavoriteplacenatgeo.com
It's about time they found Pau.
Kobe is ready!
On this occasion Lamar Odom has risen like "yeast"
Neither team has shot well in the 2nd half.
Lamar strikes again with his 4th block
We were not protecting the ball & taking good shots.
Great pass from Gasol & his 5th block
Kobe can't continue to try to dribble through a zone.
Lamar is making a great display of talent & heart.
No AB?
Denver is in the bonus from here on. It will affect their Defense
Lakers are  getting diverse scoring, a key 4 them.
This game will be won by the most efficient team from here on . Free throws will be big.
Lamar Odom is everywhere in the 2nd half!
It's the Lamar O show.
Here is where the Lakers can take over the game.
Odom makes things happen but Pau is our most efficient player. He needs to touch the ball moe oten.
It looks like another chiller and thriller! Game tied @ each quarter
Defense will do it every time.
That's my boy Shannon Brown!
Denver must not get 2nd shots!
We cant allow Nuggets to get offensive rebounds!
Lakes must limit Denver to 1 shot per possession.
Kobe is warming up...
If Carmelo gets going it will be a long nite 4 the Lakers.
Lakers will make them pay 4 every mistake like they did at the end of the half.
Lakers are getting points in the paint but Denver is making their shots from the outside
The second half is going to be a great contest!
Gasol & Kobe have not had to do all the work tonight they are getting good contributions from the team
Fish is a factor tonight - 1st time in 3 games
Lakers have missed some good opportunities. Billups in early foul trouble - we have to take advantage of miss matches
Lakers have kept the Nuggets off the offensive boards  Lakers:42  Nuggets: 44
Kobe will be fresh in the 2nd half and thats bad news for the Nuggets!
Kobe 4pts - Andrew 9pts so far I'd say this is promising
Bynum is having a good game so far
I think the refs have been doing a good so far
Sasha needs to stay calm and make his shots
Anthony has not been much of a factor so far.
Diverse scoring gives Denver problems. They can't focus on Kobe.
Bynum is doing his job so far.
Lakers won't get into foul trouble that way
Nuggets have not been able to get to the the free throw line like they did last game..
They will need to increase the intensity and focus throughout the game.
Lakers have gotten off to a good start.
I wanted to wish Jerry West a Happy Birthday tomorrow!  Jerry is known as "Mr. Clutch" to his  Laker fans.
I asked the fans who would you want taking the last shot in a game-  Kobe or LeBron?  Kobe won by a landslide.
Who do you think will be the NBA champs this year: Your answer was the Lakers by a landslide!

Who do you think will be the NBA champs this year? Cast your vote @ www.kareemabduljabbar.com
All I can say to Denver is.. See You Later Alligator  (Bill Haley & the Comets)
JR Smith has worn out the Lakers with skills & desire
Nuggets aggression on offense has kept Lakers from making game changing defensive plays.
Tell me who you think will be the NBA champs this year-vote at www.kareemabduljabbar.com
Denver has been successful in shutting down  the Laker role players.
Lakers haven't been able to make the shots on defensive plays to take over this game
this is like watching a train wreck....
Denvers hustle & desire are making the difference in this game
Odom has to find a way to get more involved in this game
Bynum is going to have to step up his effort to get more minutes
the reason Bynum is not a factor in this game is because he is not familiar with playoff intensity
A comeback is not out of the question but they will have to get a more balanced effort
Bynum is not being a factor in this game
Mello is having a tough shooting performance
Lakers need this kind of help from Odom
The Lakers are a smart team and if they can keep within striking range without getting frantic they can win
Lakers can't seem to get any players other than Kobe & Pau involved in their offense
Correction on my previous trivia question 2day-U fans were right! 34 years ago today,GS swept Bullets 4 the NBA title.
At a 4 point differential the Lakers are back in this one.
Lakers must start off strong to get back into this game
I don't think Birdman is as radical as Rodman. He is just very flamboyant a la Rodman
John Barry of ESPN is correct about how the Lakers fall flat with Kobe out of the game.
Tell me who you would want  take the last shot in a game? - cast your vote @ www.kareemabduljabbar.com
@Anthony_Carter Nets had the rights from the ABA. Bucks had the rights from the NBA. Bucks made the better offer.
The Lakers have been in Denver long enough to adjust to the altitude
The  bench is responsible for the Nugget lead
The Nuggets bench has stepped up big time
5. sticking to your game plan
Here r 5 my aspects of the game 1. Team cohesion on defense 2. Effort 3. Ability 2 execute your offense 4. Patience @ both ends of the floor
Who do you guys think will be the NBA champs? Cast your vote @ www.kareemabduljabbar.com
@Anthony_Carter if you win I will DM you.. if you don't get DM learn to be faster
Lakers are losing the "effort" aspect of the game
Birdman is a committed role player & has charged up his team
we had our winner 10 min ago.. @RareSportsVids  It was 34 years ago & featured two african american head coaches
The Nuggets have made this run with Anthony on the bench..
The Nuggets are doing with pure energy at this point
@jessegl25 it was significant because it was the 1st time 2 African American coaches faced each during a championship
@RareSportsVids we have a winner. it was the 1st time 2 African American coaches faced each other in a playoff: Al Attles vs. K.C.Jones
@andrecota your close on this but not quite yet
1st one w/ right answer wins a skyhook tshirt:  24 years ago today, GS swept Bullets for NBA title. What was hist. signifigance of series?
I think Phil Jackson was wise to use Brown. He has fresh legs
the low score indicates fatigue on the part of both teams
@Lakers Re - Magic picking Denver to win - I have 2 agree w/ Michael Cooper who expects Magic to have more faith in the Lakers. KAJ33
Gasol is making it look easy
@Austinsmart94 How old are you Austin?
The height factor can be a big plus for the Lakers
@_ado Fisher is on the floor because of his experience & leadership qualities
Good shooters are missing shots for both teams
Both teams looks kind of tired
2nd shots are hurting the Lakers
the missed free throws will be a factor as the game wears on
I like the fact that Kobe is aggressive @ the start of the game
We will see if the Lakers can take control & take the Nuggets out of the game early
Lakers will have to play consistently for all 4 quarters tonight
Denver may have been hurt by the disappointment of Saturday's loss
@24Lakers7 I am disappointed that Magic didn't take the time to let these Lakers show their stuff. They were the best road team this year.
Re - Magic picking Denver to win - I have 2 agree w/ Michael Cooper who expects Magic to have more faith in the Lakers. KAJ33

The Lakers experience was crucial down the home stretch. Nuggets are probably reeling right now..
This loss can affect the Nuggets for the next game if they aren't careful!
Kobe is strong he doesn't care about fatigue in these situations
I'm sure Anthony is kicking himself for not being on the court.
A great turn of events for the Lakers!
Kobe is showing everyone the degree of his killer instinct.
if the Lakers lose it will be due to missed free throws
@award562 last team I coached as head coach was the Oklahoma Storm and we won the championship
The truth hurts!
I think that experience is crucial in games like this so I say play  the vets
Looks like Lakers are taking control
@M_B_N_T  it's tai kwon do...

Lakers have a chance to win this one!

Andrew is trying to put pressure on the Nuggets in the paint
Kobe is not the latest flavor but he is still the leader of the Lakers & the best closer you can think of. KAJ33
Kobe is at the stage where he is taken for granted.

@iverson01 imagine... it was alot rougher back then.  No chartered planes or 5 star travel....
Andrew is getting his chance to step up & deliver. He must keep his head in the game.
Lakers seem to be focused & determined.
Especially if they use the occasion to come together!
Sometimes being on the road aids a teams concentration
Lakers will stay in the game if they can defend the paint successfully
Anthony is making a statement in the Playoffs
It seems like Anthony is everywhere.
Lakers have dealt with the initial encounter & they're only down 2!

When I played the Nuggets the altitude was really tough on me
Andrew is starting so look 4 the Lakers to try 2 use their height advantage 2 dominate
hope you guys took my poll about MJ vs. King James @ www.kareemabduljabbar.com - I want to know who u think was better at 24 years old
The altitude will  effect both teams for sure but 2 what extent?
Because of their lack of consistent effort- the altitude may be a factor for them.
Will Lakers be able 2 play at their most efficient level for 48 minutes?
Do you think altitude will be a factor tonight?
