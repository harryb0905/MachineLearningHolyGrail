@Randy1116 Very nice of Erik to recommend my book, The Industries of the Future. If you give it a read please let me know what you think!
@marcolino72 @CageJulia Merci beaucoup d'avoir choisi mon livre! J'esp√®re que vous le trouverez agr√©able et instructif.
@MariaUmar @PayPal I do not think the non-presence of PayPal is the "biggest problem". I think that among the larger problems are:  1. Lack of access to opportunities for women, 50% of the population 2. Lack of access to venture capital 3. Much of the technological talent leaves Pakistan for work
@ethanjweiss It means you have the right combination of head and heart.

@mjtarjamo 3. Not doing enough to take advantage of the R&amp;D at Indian Head and the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Incubating businesses coming out of the research there presents a great opportunity 4. Universal computer science education in the K-12 schools. SoMD doesn't have what others do
@mjtarjamo I've spent lots of time in SoMD and love it. Couple quick priorities: 1. Increasing the transportation infrastructure. Traffic has gotten worse and SoMD has been overlooked 2. Apprenticeship programs in the high schools + College of Southern Maryland. Untapped potential

We could have gotten a ‚Äúcrash pad‚Äù in DC to be closer to work and make the long hours at the State Department easier, but it was important to Felicity and I that we live in Maryland, raise our kids in Maryland, and vote in Maryland.
I spent 13 years commuting from Baltimore to DC via MARC. It was 90 minutes each way, and it meant leaving the house at 6am and often getting home after the kids went to bed. Too many Marylanders are stuck with the same soul-crushing commutes

@epiphanyinbmore I appreciated the question you asked last night. Your cynicism is justified.   I wanted to share more specifics/depth regarding my education plan. Please check out https://t.co/RzUbk2hNvB
If you want to strengthen Maryland‚Äôs schools, send a teacher as your next Governor. That's why the Baltimore Sun called my education plan the ‚Äúmost comprehensive‚Äù in the Democratic field.  https://t.co/G603fSs18v https://t.co/fjHR9yJPGJ
Last night, I joined @TheRealNews to discuss an issue of personal importance: education. I came to Baltimore 24 years ago to teach in Baltimore City, and since leaving the classroom, our schools continue to be marginalized &amp; underserved. That needs to change. https://t.co/rB5fBmiTSu
Early vote begins tomorrow! Polls are open 10am-8pm. Look up your early votes site here:   https://t.co/3koPuGbzMu
@morganshowalter It was good to meet you, Morgan. Thank you for all you are doing inside and outside the classroom for our students.
Looking forward to a productive discussion this evening!  Join the conversation &amp; listen in ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/cR2QAfnFOX
Joined @JulieVerratti &amp; @MDBrewers in Baltimore County this morning for their monthly meeting. Our small businesses, especially craft breweries, are overregulated. We need leaders who understand what it takes to operate a business in order to help strengthen our economy. https://t.co/Ipt0iYH7JA
Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not.  We need to make sure that every Marylander in every zip code has the same access to opportunity.   https://t.co/UgpVU9Lh65 https://t.co/zaPSdtk2vz
Julie Verratti: 1 Great track record in govt Her responsibilities @SBAgov included "Boots to Business" program for returning service members   2 Small business owner. She, her wife &amp; brother-in-law run @DenizensBrewing   3 Great person. Kindness incarnate  https://t.co/QZUbrbE4hd
Spent afternoon with the student leaders of #MarchForOurLives Baltimore &amp; my friend The Reverend Alvin C. Hathaway, Sr. of Union Baptist Church to talk about how we can keep the focus on gun safety and not lose the momentum we have begun to build to make America less gun-crazed. https://t.co/hMfEBuElyS
Here is what a Baltimore Sun Editorial said about that education plan  https://t.co/G603fSs18v https://t.co/erZjYazPbS
Started the day at the Shri Mangal Mandir &amp; Gujarati Samaj Carnival.  Biggest topic of discussion was education. Folks unhappy with the back-sliding of Maryland's public schools.  Here's my plan to restore Maryland to having America's best public schools: https://t.co/OwoBkYpqcd https://t.co/hHAi4Q75yw
I‚Äôm going to do things differently as Governor. We‚Äôll get to the core of a problem, dig a little deeper, and get us outside of the old establishment mindset of running our state.  https://t.co/UgpVU9Lh65 https://t.co/Z8qStXVmtS
There is a moral and legal basis for Governors to protect the rights of families and not see them ripped apart.  What is taking place is unAmerican and inhuman. #Resist   https://t.co/VoW1w8BYno
@Dave_Rapids Yes!
While some of my opponents are scared to stand up to @realDonaldTrump and ICE, we‚Äôll continue to do the right thing and protect the rights of all Marylanders and our guests. https://t.co/r5f7Cft9ke
7/ While we're talking about laws though, let's talk about @KrishForMD's campaign. She's trying to skirt campaign finance laws and she's misleading voters claiming she's eligible to run.    That's a "lack of understanding.‚Äù  https://t.co/C3QD1ZKq22   https://t.co/lcX94bza6N
6/ In Maryland we respect the Office of President but we do not bend the knee &amp; he is not a king. ¬†When he orders unlawful, immoral acts I will resist and use the full force of the office to protect people inside our borders be them from MD, VA, Mexico, Canada, or anywhere else.
5/ This is not all that controversial. Local law enforcement are absolutely within the right to arrest federal agents when they violate state or local laws. See the 10th amendment. https://t.co/Ydx48JzhY9
@KrishForMD 4/ Sometimes being an executive requires grappling with tough situations. While it might make people uncomfortable it doesn‚Äôt remove the obligation to do what is right and lawful.
3/ I would think @KrishForMD would remember, as I do from my time at the State Department, that federal employees including LEOs are required to comply with state law at all times.¬†If you think federal employees are above the law then you are running in the wrong primary.
2/ @KrishForMD says this is a lack of understanding of the law, but that‚Äôs just wrong. It doesn‚Äôt take a Yale Law degree to know that we need someone who will stand up to ICE to protect Marylanders and our guests. Being a federal agent does not mean you are above the law.
1/ I‚Äôve said this since the beginning of my campaign: Donald Trump has let ICE "off the leash", and as governor, I will protect the rights of MDers and our guests. If necessary, I will order the State Troopers to intervene and protect the rights of MDers. https://t.co/bzULalGZtf
@Neweralive2018 Which issues or attributes for a Governor are most important to you?
@DavidPontious If anything I was insulting pigs
@C_Broome @The_Woodcock_ Uh, no. I‚Äôm specifically referencing the Caprio murder.
Here‚Äôs a challenge for viewers during the debate:  Count how often the candidates say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only one‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one‚Äù, ‚Äúas the one who‚Äù, ‚Äúonly I can‚Äù, ‚ÄúI led‚Äù, ‚ÄúI did‚Äù, etc.  So much ‚Äúme‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù. This is why people don‚Äôt like politics. It‚Äôs the vanity of career politicians.
Debate time! Tune in now on @wjz channel 13 or online at https://t.co/qMtocK8Iqb
Anybody who takes the time to actively engage our Muslim communities in America would understand their contributions- to business, to education, to culture. To America.  Go to an Iftar as a guest. Listen. Learn. You‚Äôll find it as rewarding as I always do &amp; leave with new friends.
It was a beautiful evening yesterday in Anne Arundel County where I was able to participate at an iftar dinner at the Makkar Learning Center - a place where Muslims from 46 countries come together to worship and find community. https://t.co/Ud0rzzYOZ8
We need to make sure that every high schooler graduates prepared for college or a career. That means making massive investments in apprenticeships and the skilled-trades so that every Marylander is prepared for the industries of the future.  https://t.co/TobOUWJ4Tm https://t.co/pA2PMoSaQD

@paulschwartzman Those polls are OLD :)  Only poll that matters in the primary is on June 26th. I‚Äôm sure Anthony Brown and Hillary Clinton would agree
‚ÄúMr. Ross is not unique in his focus on apprenticeships and vocational training, but his vision for the role they can play in creating a 21st century workforce is the most thoroughly developed.‚Äù  https://t.co/G603fSs18v

@RyanRMiner @SenJohnMcCain I had extensive interactions with @SenJohnMcCain when he was chairing the Senate Armed Forces Committee and I worked @StateDept and he was indeed the anti-Trump. Country first. Open-minded. Principled.
@aajryan YES!
@planetesh I refuse to call it a "rain tax". It was a stormwater management fee to help manage the effects of severe weather. Weather made more common by climate change.  We're living with the consequences of Hogan being good at politics and bad at governing.

As Governor, a priority of mine will be to ensure that any gun bought, sold or imported into MD has a biometric Smart Grip so that only the licensed owner can shoot it.  No grip. No gun. No sale.  Read more about my plan to reduce gun violence: https://t.co/CucWIEmP2G
Today, I #WearOrange as a @MomsDemand gun sense candidate and proud recipient of an ‚ÄúF‚Äù from the @NRA.  Meaningful efforts have been taken to reduce gun violence in Maryland, but we can, and should, do better. https://t.co/8uyS7ukQoF

@sasschristina @Andela_Kenya OMG!
@jeffzrebiecsun Wait, what?
@onlinesavant You're right re job training and preparation. Here's my plan https://t.co/hWudi4TmmA
A software engineer in Baltimore has a real adjusted salary of $77,322.   Baltimore has the third highest demand for software engineers.  We should be creating educational pathways for Marylanders to get these jobs! https://t.co/kFOynfyP5M
The NRA employs some sick people.   I'm proud of my "F" from the NRA (which by my scoring stands for "Fantastic") and proud to be a @MomsDemand candidate.  https://t.co/QA8KQmFrv7
For 13 years I rode the MARC train between Baltimore and Washington. I saw the system's strengths and short-comings. We need to fully implement the MARC plan and prioritize funding for more rail service.  We need better coordination between state &amp; city on transit &amp; land use  3/3
My priority as Governor on transit issues would be to encourage mode shift - to move us to the extent possible from being a state dominated by single passenger cars to transit and biking.  This is good economic development. Good for public health. Enhances quality of life  2/3
"An advanced society is not one where the poor drive cars, but where the rich ride transit."  I share this view of @JSadikKhan and I opened the @TransitChoices @CMTAlliance @1000FriendsofMD @moretrnstequity @bikemorebmore @BmoreCPHA @GlobalShapers Forum with her quote.  1/3
.@ValerieErvin is right. She should be on the ballot. Period. This is America. I‚Äôm told we can do big things. Hopefully reprinting ballots doesn‚Äôt define our limitations. https://t.co/KXN1zU6zjT
Too many Marylanders lack the access to reliable mass-transit or suffer the anguish of soul-crushing commutes.  Road widening &amp; toll-slashing won‚Äôt deliver the 21st century transportation infrastructure needed to grow our economy @LarryHogan.  Join the discussion now ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/NeZInSQbz0
@RemoteClancy No no - I didn't take it as rude at all! I thought it was a totally valid observation which is why I responded! (I ignore the rude ones)
@RemoteClancy Appreciated on all this...
@RemoteClancy You should have been on our email list earlier LOL. Here is a round-up of policy positions https://t.co/kpumPs1YnV  Is there an issue or two that stand out as most important to you?
@HoldingOn2Stars That‚Äôs the long-term approach. The short-term approach is to heavily invest in rebuilding the community in partnership with its citizens and small businesses
We‚Äôll fix this on day 1! The local school districts should be able to set their own calendars. https://t.co/R6nIqVMl3u
The idea that Larry Hogan is good for business is factually inaccurate.  Maryland can do better than this. We can imagine and invent a much better economic future that reaches all of our communities.  https://t.co/N0wBTygZgU
I taught too many students who ended up dead or in jail. We failed them.  My comments yesterday at the Gubernatorial Debate about the need to break the school-to-prison pipeline as reported in the Baltimore Sun: https://t.co/5ts5qEYJEr
10 minutes until debate #2! Tune in on News Channel 8 in Washington area and on CW54 in the Baltimore region.
@hunterwalk @CBarlerin You and I both married our betters!
For every @WarbyParker or @harrys that manages to break into a concentrated market, there are hundreds of companies that either can't get started or fail because of oligopoly and monopoly power.  For many, success means survival, and survival means selling out to the monopoly
The concentration of corporate power continues.   Oligopolies and monopolies that dominate supply chains make it near-impossible to be a small business owner.  We need elected officials who recognize this is a problem and have the will to take action.  https://t.co/gTTqNvBpZ9
@MackStrangle Purchase across state lines and bring into Maryland.
@wyattcp @AdamParkhomenko Thank you and yes, thank you.
Yes, doing anything responsible related to guns is hard and I get threats all the time.   The way I score it, my ‚ÄúF‚Äù from NRA stands for ‚ÄúFantastic‚Äù.  Also: ‚ÄúF‚Äù the NRA  https://t.co/Awel81OCGU
As Governor a priority of mine will be to ensure that any gun bought, sold or imported into Maryland has a biometric Smart Grip so that only the licensed owner can shoot it.   No grip. No sale. No gun.  https://t.co/J76lexxuBk

@DanaGrayson @WUBRG I love Frederick! Great city. I especially love how the citizens and small business owners seem to be building a Frederick that would have been unimaginable 15 years ago
A common refrain I heard from Democrats all weekend is that the Democratic Party needs a re-boot. We need new faces and new ideas. https://t.co/QGSr26HPeN
Spent the weekend visiting small businesses across the state. People just now tuning into the Governor's race.  I consistently heard hope expressed for a Governor with "Democratic Values and Business Sense", a combination that @JulieVerratti and I are trying to bring. https://t.co/fACY0Karlf

I spent time yesterday with an ATF agent with 20+ years of experience  He agreed that "Smart Gun" technology preventing firearms from being fired by anyone other than their owners works and is a good solution.   Said the NRA is discouraging manufacturers.  https://t.co/fF4oDgIGPU
A common refrain throughout the day: small businesses that buy and hire local compete at a systematic disadvantage against global conglomerates.  The concentration of corporate power and their control over pricing &amp; distribution creates unfair advantages against small businesses
The team @LYONDISTILLING helped bring distilling back to Maryland.  Another female-powered enterprise.  In addition to owning and running her business, Jaime Windon also serves her community by serving on her town's board of commissioners https://t.co/mcQSz1XfgL

Lots of pearl clutching when I said we needed to protect citizens and guests from ICE.  Looks more than ever like ICE is chock-a-block with bullies and racists. Just like their president: the vulgar, demented pig demon Donald Trump.  https://t.co/WpLKnr2phW https://t.co/nptbgp50Bz
Hey @DanRodricks remember our conversation last October about ICE?  The public is now seeing what I saw then. ICE officers "off the leash" to use Trump's expression produces massive violations of rights and behavior that is downright UnAmerican.  https://t.co/Rt9aOhBQ0R

@pete_apps Hi Pete!
My thoughts are with the colleagues and loved ones of the brave @BACOPoliceFire officer killed in the line of duty. Our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day and I am grateful for the work they do and the sacrifices they make to keep our communities safe.
@GhstofStateCrcl Let's concede one thing: you and I are both thoughtful people who do not arrive at our conclusions casually

I‚Äôve been a public school teacher, an entrepreneur, a janitor, a non-profit executive, a senior official in the Obama Administration, and I wrote a book about our economic future. I‚Äôm a husband and a father of three.  My name is Alec Ross and I hope to be your next Governor.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.  I‚Äôm frustrated. I reject the idea that we cannot do better.  We are the home to the NSA, NIH, the Goddard Space Center, and world-class universities.  MD is a place where we are inventing the future. A place where we can be optimistic and hopeful.
Too many families have someone who is battling mental health or substance abuse.  We sit in soul-crushing commutes.  To many of the kids I grew up with in coal country and too many of the 6th graders I taught in Baltimore are either dead or in jail.
And yet, we also have some of the worst schools in America. Some of our schools don‚Äôt have heat or air conditioning.  Out of 50 states, Maryland is the only one whose economy is projected to go down in 2018.
I love Maryland. I‚Äôve lived in Baltimore for 25 years, and I‚Äôm proud to be raising my family here.  We have 3.9% unemployment. We have the highest median household income in the US. We have some of the best schools in America.
Ready for the first debate! Tune in tonight on @wbaltv11 or @mptnews https://t.co/46HC8etNRN
I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but based on reporting from @BethesdaBeat &amp; @washingtonpost, it‚Äôs very confusing to me how @KrishForMD is allowed on the ballot but @ValerieErvin is not.  We need integrity and accuracy in our elections in Maryland.  https://t.co/uyKP73JDCk

It was a good discussion and a great day to be on the water.   5/5 https://t.co/2IIbr6Gdyz
He thinks it's hilarious (and wrong) that most people in fancy restaurants or bars eat oysters by slurping little oysters.   He says the bigger the oyster the better and "my mother taught me to chew my food".   4/5 https://t.co/cpC3Gby5Ue
Ed runs a 7 man crew and his goal is to pull in about 6,000 bushels a year  Ed shared that for every $3/oyster we eat on the half-shell at a fancy restaurant, the oysterman gets about 25 cents.   (We returned these oysters to the Bay where we pulled them out)  3/5 https://t.co/ENXoGMMwrN
When Ed started oystering, he says there were 8,000 oystermen working the Bay. That fell to as few as 600 and is now around 800.  He said many oystermen left the water permanently when the supply of oysters plummeted and they found more stable jobs working as prison guards.  2/5
Being "pro business" or "pro environment" is a false choice. What's good for the environment is good for business.  To listen to the perspective of watermen, I spent the day on the water on a Skipjack with Ed, who has been an oysterman on the Chesapeake Bay for 46 years.  1/5 https://t.co/X5c5S4UIxV

School superintendents going to jail in one county, unauthorized pay raises in another, former cabinet secretaries and donors getting $70mil contracts.   Clearly something is wrong with the old way of doing things.  Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs time for change in Maryland?

6. The Trump Administration has given the green light to corporate polluters, and unlike our current Governor, I will stand up to unethical companies who trade clean and accessible water for short-term corporate profits.
5. We need to toughen up our environmental standards. That means Renewable Portfolio Standard goals of 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2040.
4. We‚Äôll make sure Maryland has the most electric vehicle charging stations per capita. We want to make sure anyone who wants to get an EV doesn‚Äôt have to worry about range anxiety.
3. Build the Country‚Äôs premier Clean Job Pipeline through our high schools, community colleges, and universities. We‚Äôll triple the number of certificates earned and apprenticeship positions filled in Maryland‚Äôs clean energy sector.
2. Renew our commitment to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. If it‚Äôs not clean enough to let our kids swim in it, it‚Äôs not clean enough.
The full plan is online (https://t.co/WcMOQrHdRV), but here are some of the highlights:  1. Create a green bank to help small biz, homeowners, and families take advantage of successful, established clean energy technologies like solar panels and energy efficiency improvements.

Thank you to the students, educators, advocates, and volunteers from @StrongSchoolsMD for the postcards! I wanted to take a minute to respond to some of them here. https://t.co/zQmTQEDdax
@s_saqib_ali @JHUAPL @tom_heffner One Economy. It‚Äôs on my website (https://t.co/SsV5N8zfJY), my LinkedIn (https://t.co/iKNNaYcCYo) and I talk about it on the trail all the time.
Thank you to @HoCoYoungDems for having Julie and I at your monthly meeting to talk about our campaign and the importance of fresh faces, ideas &amp; leadership in governance for the future of MD. https://t.co/H4CW31adWZ
Had a great time in Laurel last night talking about my plans to make Maryland an incubator for startups &amp; small businesses. As the home of @JHUAPL, Laurel is primed to be a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship! Thanks to @tom_heffner for hosting us! https://t.co/EssOwoK6aj
About time. https://t.co/KEmgvQJNZb
Thanks to my friend @MartinOMalley for joining us in Silver Spring last night.   Under Gov. O'Malley, MD consistently had the #1 schools in the country.   Under @LarryHogan, our schools have continued to decline. We can't afford another 4 years of his failed education policies. https://t.co/3ZYLhpz4ac
.@citizenmoc joined me and we had a great conversation about bringing broadband to Western MD and the continued renaissance of cities like Frederick. https://t.co/eaL1YPfVBj

One way we can make it easier for people to stay in their local communities: universal high speed internet across Maryland. The internet is the backbone of the industries of the present and future and we need to make sure everyone has the infrastructure to succeed.
I grew up in coal country, and I know that folks in Western Maryland don‚Äôt want to be told that they have to move closer to DC or Baltimore to get a job. We need to do more to bring opportunity to all of our communities in Maryland.

@gymkay1 Thank you!
This needs to stop now, and if our leaders won't fix it, let's vote them out of office and elect someone who will.
Meanwhile, @LarryHogan has been focused on keeping his A- rating from the @NRA. We need a governor that will lead, not bow to the gun lobby.
@NRA These are just a few steps we can take to make MD the #1 state in the country for gun safety. Until these bills are signed into law, we must continue to apply pressure on the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in Annapolis.
5. Kick the @NRA off of the Maryland Handgun Roster Board. This isn‚Äôt complicated: the NRA has no right to a spot on Maryland‚Äôs main handgun regulatory board.
4. Ban bump stocks.
3. Give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to ensure they can remove firearms from those legally prohibited from having them.
2. Allow our cities, towns, and counties to regulate firearms above the state levels. Our local communities know what is best for their safety.
@MartinOMalley 1. Close the loophole that allows people who have been convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor to purchase a gun.
Maryland made tremendous progress under @MartinOMalley, but there are some steps to take to finish his legacy and make MD the number one state in the country for gun safety. Here are a few:
We know this: It‚Äôs too easy to get a gun, and it‚Äôs too hard to get help.
Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, and other supporters of gun safety reform will march in Washington and around the country. Their strong voices have already changed the national debate.
A key point of discussion at the Eastport Democratic Club today was about how seniors suffer the most when public transportation is unsafe, unreliable and too often non-existent . https://t.co/Gkmfy6fzUt

One barrier that stood out in my discussions with the students is transportation. The lack of in-school access to educational &amp; technology resources can mean hours added to the day on lousy public transit to get to far-away after-school programs like this one.    3/4 https://t.co/ZmDM8HjDQq
Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not.   I saw genius @DHFBaltimore. Programs like theirs should exist state-wide.

@traceygaughran @BaltCitySchools The students at Poly are such great kids. My wife and I are really pleased to be Poly parents.  Some of the schools and districts promised suspensions for students who walked out. These protests are civics in action. I'm hopeful city schools continue to support peaceful protests.
I woke up this morning invigorated by the experience of joining my son Colton and his classmates yesterday at Poly High School @BaltCitySchools for #NationalWalkoutDay  These young people are leading where adults and career politicians have failed. https://t.co/7XgUzT59EY

What would make Baltimore more safe in 10 years, hiring 1,000 teachers and counselors or 1,000 police officers?  I think Baltimore would be a safer, healthier place if we hired the 1,000 teachers.  And to the question of cost, pay now or pay later.  https://t.co/fxGTsegu6J

@morganshowalter I‚Äôm in violent agreement with you. No one thing is entirely deterministic of future well-being but education is the closest. Hard to thrive after a bad education and a great education doesn‚Äôt guarantee future well-being but it goes a long way.

I‚Äôm running with @JulieVerratti because we believe that our government needs new faces and new ideas. We‚Äôre going to bring opportunity to every zip code by investing in education, in mass transit, in Maryland.
2018 is not just about the top of the ticket. It‚Äôs about the school board candidates and the house of delegate candidates and the PTA parents. We need to take back our state, and then we need to take back our country.
@JacobTook I don‚Äôt do tweet-sized policy! Check it out: https://t.co/JduBOPEl8k
I‚Äôm in favor of the full legalization, regulation and taxation of recreational marijuana. Then we need to have a proactive plan to expunge the records of anyone with an offense.  My team and I hashed all out the details. Read our plan to make this happen: https://t.co/JduBOPEl8k
What will make Baltimore safer in 10 years? If you give me a choice between 1000 new teachers and counselors or 1000 new police officers, I‚Äôm going to bet on the teachers. We need to invest in education not incarceration.
We were told the gas tax would be invested in mass transit, and then our leaders in Annapolis directed the money to road building and highway widening. It‚Äôs time for a governor who will keep promises and invest in mass transit across our state.
I‚Äôm going to be undiplomatic here: we don‚Äôt have a red line because African American voters didn‚Äôt vote for @LarryHogan. We need to stop electing the same-old same-old politicians who put politics before people. #BlueMaryland

@staceypawson I think our failure to put real gun safety measures in place = insane. We make it easier for a teenager to buy an assault weapon than to drive a car.
@AynRandPaulRyan Holly, please know how very, very much I appreciate your support. Big thank you!!
This is why we have to prepare Maryland for the industries of the future now. I understand that the future is a bit scary, but I know that with an innovative vision we can make sure every Marylander has the chance to succeed in tomorrow's economy. https://t.co/AJt6br3gGz
@realDonaldTrump Lock up Trump!
That's why we released an election reform plan last fall. We should make Maryland the national leader on election security and voting rights, and here's how we can do it: https://t.co/W8UgyCrBB3
It's estimated that Russian hackers tried to infiltrate election systems in as many as 39 states in 2016, but still this fall, 41 states plan to use voting machines that are over 10 years old. We need a plan now to secure our democracy and elections. https://t.co/FXCrmAVMoT
Congrats to @ChefCindyWolf and Tony Conte of @pizzeriainferno on being named semifinalists for the James @BeardFoundation award! Proud to have you both representing Maryland's incredible food culture. https://t.co/KWXx52xac5
Pray for those who don't act because they seek power offered by merchants of death (@NRA). Let us use our God-given sense to hold them to account at the ballot box before they're judged by God. May we act to save lives in honor of the 13k Americans killed with guns annually. /2
My prayer after #Parkland:  Let us use our God-given gifts of judgment and wisdom to govern in a way that doesn't lead to our slaughter. Let us acknowledge the data that shows access to guns leads to more violence, including the 400+ people shot in schools since Sandy Hook. /1
This op-ed from @clewishalpern of @AllStarCode is spot-on. We need to make sure people of color and women are no longer underrepresented in tech. Universal computer science education in Maryland would go a long way in helping close the achievement gap. https://t.co/ZTp6hLFAt4
Our kids deserve fully funded schools every year, not just election years. https://t.co/Uo5rQJsLi4
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre deflecting blame that you and your fellow Republicans have for enabling easy access to weapons like the AR 15 used in this shooting.
@rlbrown1791 Hi Becca, I'm on the record with a number of specific proposals but it boils down to the obvious (but impossible, for Republicans and too many Democrats) conclusion that owning and using a gun should be done with equivalent standards we put into owning and using an automobile.
@rlbrown1791 @LarryHogan He is doing nothing
A suggestion:  Once you're done praying, call on your fellow Republicans who control the White House, the Congress, the Supreme Court and 33 State Houses and say it's time to own up to your complicity in the violence.  https://t.co/1vfRNVHblB
Members of Congress who refuse to take action on gun safety are co-conspirators in the murder of these 17 students and the more than 40,000 Americans killed with guns in the last three years.
Four of the ten most diverse cities in the country are in Montgomery County. When we think of Montgomery County, we think of it as a prosperous place to live and raise a family. This is no coincidence. Their diversity is their strength. https://t.co/Cf2SjbZflt

@mlawless9 Baltimore needs 21st century infrastructure - that means world-class mass transit that connects our communities and people to one affordably, equitably and fast. That‚Äôs not happening. Time for change.
@spirilis @peterfranchot Really pleased to hear that, Eric. The Comptroller has done a good job of getting the word out and we need to make sure that everyone in the General Assembly understands the importance of supporting our Maryland-based craft brewers.
This isn't just about beer though. Maryland's small and medium-sized businesses shouldn't be at a disadvantage to multinational businesses with massive lobbying budgets. https://t.co/vkIFtaftcz
I spoke to @NaptownPint about my support for our craft brewers and what I think we need to do to empower them. Here's what I said: https://t.co/34uVNZSTfS
This bill would be a step backward. Annapolis should make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to succeed by passing @PeterFranchot's Reform on Tap Act. It would remove these arbitrary limits and help Maryland breweries thrive. #MDGA18 https://t.co/qSb43dSn53

Treat the opioid crisis as a public health crisis, not a law enforcement issue. Allow opioid users who seek help to receive care without fear of arrest. Train more people to administer Naloxone in the case of overdose. Push people to rehab centers rather than prisons. /2
Congress has no plan to adequately fund or address the opioid crisis, and @LarryHogan says "I don't know what we can be doing differently." We must commit to this in the same way that we did for the HIV/AIDS crisis. Here are a few ideas to get started. /1 https://t.co/JBNRh58LS0
@Corey_Johns @brentdanley Thanks, @Corey_Johns! Hope to meet you at an event soon too. DM me your email, and I'll make sure you get the details for upcoming events.

Thank you for inviting me to testify on your computer science education bill, @ArunaMiller. I am proud to support this important legislation to help kids across Maryland. #MDGA18 https://t.co/DCTkZSAJq6
In the future, either machines will tell workers what to do or workers will tell machines what to do. In Maryland, we need to make sure that our children are telling the machines what to do. The place to start meeting this challenge is the classroom. #MDGA18
This bill mirrors what I have advocated for as well ‚Äî setting requirements for all schools to offer computer science courses, creating funding sources to help meet this goal, and putting special focus on advancing girls and communities of color that have been previously left out.
Teachers understand the urgency to deliver CS education, even if they haven‚Äôt gotten all the support they need from the state. We need to build on their good work ‚Äî such as the CE21 programs hosted by UMBC &amp; UMCP &amp; the CS classes offered in local schools like those in Charles Co.
60% of MD schools don‚Äôt offer CS courses. Meanwhile, 20k+ cyber-security jobs requiring computing skills were left unfilled in MD in 2016 because employers couldn‚Äôt find qualified applicants. Most troubling, women &amp; people of color are underrepresented among grads w/ CS training.
I am delighted to support HB 281‚Äî which represents the leadership we need in Annapolis.  Tech is transforming our economy, and code powers that change. This is a major economic shift, and we aren‚Äôt ready for it. #MDGA18 https://t.co/H4qhPONdc1
I could talk all day about the industries of the future, how technology is changing our economy, &amp; how to modernize gov't w/ technical innovation. But it all starts in the classroom. That‚Äôs why my first policy proposal was a detailed plan for CS education. https://t.co/RlE2W3PYAx
I started my career as a 6th-grade teacher at Booker T. Washington Middle School in Baltimore. That‚Äôs where I met my wife, who is still an educator with @BaltCitySchools. All of my kids are in @BaltCitySchools. This isn't politics for me. This is my life. #MDGA18
I have spoken with thousands of Marylanders since I launched my campaign for governor last spring. Education tops the list of concerns held by our citizens. #MDGA18

I'm headed down to Annapolis today to testify in support of @ArunaMiller's computer science education bill. Tune in on Facebook Live later to hear my remarks about this important legislation that will help prepare our kids for tomorrow's economy. #MDGA18 https://t.co/PiRAgNtIuT
Beyond investing more, I think we also need to do more. Maryland should get ahead of the curve and make sure our kids are the ones telling machines what to do in the future. We can make that the reality by passing universal computer science education. https://t.co/RlE2W3PYAx
My vision for education is the exact opposite. As a former @BaltCitySchools teacher with an understanding of where our economy is going, I know what it'll take to prepare kids in every zip code for the industries of the future. Here's where I would start: https://t.co/P9iQHVrFWV
While billionaire @BetsyDeVos gets a tax cut she can use to buy a couple more homes, she brags about undermining public education. With the way technology is transforming our economy, we need to invest more in public education now more than ever. https://t.co/yr0Y5b449L

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."  Why wouldn't we want to reduce emergency room visits and save money for our state? That makes no sense unless punishing poor people is the motive. https://t.co/V4b2PNrkGx
This is exactly what 10-year-old me thought it would be like to live in the future, and it is exactly the future I want to help build. With assets like @NASAGoddard, Maryland can shape and create the future. We just need a leader who has the vision. https://t.co/PRcnBbtsio
It's 2018, and it takes someone putting up a webcam to see what is going on during session. The lack of transparency in Annapolis is ridiculous. I worked on open government and transparency for @BarackObama, and I know Maryland has a lot of work to do. https://t.co/xSULXFJwku
@JuliaIsWriting In a word: yes. It's INSANE. My wife is an educator in Baltimore City Public Schools. My 3 kids in Baltimore City Public Schools. Local jurisdictions should be making these decisions.

Our 9-1-1 system is vulnerable to cyber attacks, which could take our emergency response system offline. That's why I'm supporting Sen. @CherylKagan's 9-1-1 bill (SB285). It will bring together experts to improve our current system ‚Äî including a focus on cybersecurity. #MDGA18

@dalgoso Much less risky than charging child care to a credit card which is what is happening now. The amount paid back varies depending on earnings so the downside risk is bounded.  The inspiration came from working moms who told me they're charging to credit cards or leaving work
@dalgoso Quality of care would flows from existing certification program. Not building anything new.  Re the financing mechanism, it's based on the ISA model that has proven to work in lieu of student loans. Would have to be closely monitored, but real recipe disaster = no access to care.
The cost of a quality, accredited child care center is twice the average tuition at a state school in Maryland, but we're doing even less to address these enormous costs. We need drastic change that puts the needs of working families first. https://t.co/2KVuPw2Zsm https://t.co/ddO9FxEltG
Under our current system, 78% of eligible kids in Maryland don't actually get the help they need. Rather than an election year band-aid, we need a new system: https://t.co/sJNv5Kzm6A
Affordable child care is one of the most important, least discussed issues for working families. I put out a bold plan last July because I know it is a fundamental economic issue today. https://t.co/a5kJXnermM https://t.co/1GYoP7JYfI
@scovillb Big, big thank you!
@baltimoresun Since @LarryHogan took office, the max household income to receive a child care subsidy has dropped from $30,000 to $23,000. That's cruel.  Here's my plan to address this: https://t.co/2KVuPw2Zsm

What I hope with the #MeToo movement is that we seize on this moment to make sure that there is no tolerance for harassment anywhere. Period. We cannot ease up on those who must be punished for their transgressions. #GoucherYVF
People who tell you that raising the minimum wage to $15 is bad for business are just wrong. Corporate profits are at an all-time high, but wages have been stagnate for decades. #GoucherYVF
We also need to re-examine our own policies in Maryland. We‚Äôre not as progressive on the environment as we sometimes think we are. For example, our agricultural policies related to chicken farms and the resulting pollution in the Chesapeake Bay are a major problem. #GoucherYVF
The first step to protect MD‚Äôs environment is to fully fund and staff @BrianFrosh‚Äôs office. He needs to have the authority and resources to take Donald Trump to court any time his administration attacks Maryland‚Äôs environment. #GoucherYVF https://t.co/0OYIDX8bnn
Question from @GoucherCollege student Jessica: How do we protect Maryland‚Äôs environment, especially with federal funding at risk under the Trump Administration? #GoucherYVF

@LarryHogan Montgomery County made the final cut because Ike Leggett and the @MoCoCouncilMD were already doing this work. They made smart investments in their community, and now it's paying off.

Some Kirwan Commission findings:  - 15th most regressive funding system for K-12 education - Shortage of STEM teachers - "Great decline" in interest in teaching  We're not giving our teachers the proper respect ‚Äî starting at the top with @LarryHogan. https://t.co/0XZPmnQ9nH
@JohnDediePolSci Certainly possible! DM me your email and details
Becky the Barbarian wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way. #ThanksMom https://t.co/gqU3bdeDCK
We make it too hard for small businesses and innovators to get ahead. We see it in the struggle between international beer conglomerates and MD's craft brewers. My interview with @NaptownPint talks about how government should break down these barriers. https://t.co/qBDMkyBMZW
@tomangell Hi Tom, Here is my plan to legalize and regulate the adult use of marijuana https://t.co/3PPCqGOAEj  Prohibition does not work. As Governor, I would end prohibition AND do expungement of criminal records of minor, non-violent marijuana-related offenses.
@glennjr1975 Hi Glenn (and Tom!), Here is my plan to legalize and regulate the adult use of marijuana https://t.co/3PPCqGOAEj  Prohibition does not work. As Governor, I would end prohibition AND do expungement of criminal records of minor, non-violent marijuana-related offenses.
@LarryHogan Then you ought to be thinking about leaving the Republican Party each and every day.

It was an example of something my old bosses @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton often reminded us: Americans are good, decent people at heart and government can innovate in powerful ways.
I called the big mobile companies and got them to waive their fees so that donations had a greater impact. We expected it to raise a few hundred thousand dollars, but people stepped up and gave more than $40M at a cost of $0 to taxpayers.
We worked through the night and launched a pioneering text-to-give program. By texting HAITI to 90999, people could send $10 directly to the relief efforts.
A team of our hard-charging diplomats led by three strong women ‚Äî Katie, Katie, and Caitlyn ‚Äî jumped into action.
Shortly after the earthquake hit, we knew it was bad ‚Äî hundreds of thousands of people would die. @HillaryClinton called us and challenged us to figure out how to immediately engage the American people in relief efforts by the next morning.
8 years ago to the minute, at 4:53 PM ET, a devastating earthquake hit Haiti. I was working @StateDept and saw firsthand how government can be a force for good, something easily forgotten today.  [Thread]
This is a win for Maryland's families. @LarryHogan's veto last year pushed our state in the wrong direction. This will help employees, companies and our state do better, and we need a governor who recognizes that. https://t.co/A3NWVnrend

@matthewstoller Main two points from this  https://t.co/34uVNZSTfS https://t.co/Oh81KJ11lI
@matthewstoller At the state level, the international beer conglomerates have perfected the science of screwing over local brewers through the laws governing local distribution networks of alcohol. Pretty rampant across country. My uncensored two cents here https://t.co/34uVNZSTfS

Senator Oaks should resign immediately. If he cannot recognize that Baltimore deserves a new leader in Annapolis, then Democrats must act swiftly to replace him with someone honest and effective.
@Vannoy_Jim @ErinatTheSun @lukebroadwater He should resign. I‚Äôm going to contribute to his opponent. It‚Äôs an embarrassment for Baltimore. Enough already.
If we want to give every Marylander the chance to succeed, then we need to improve education and find people better jobs in Maryland. I chatted with @WashInformer about how I plan to do just that. https://t.co/9hARa9sKx8
Finger-in-the-wind @LarryHogan is back at it ‚Äî doing enough to get a press release and a headline without actually solving the problem. https://t.co/yGkNhdkXAO
We shouldn't label policies as "women's issues." Success for women is success for Maryland. We all have a stake in it. Our approach to policymaking and leadership must be intersectional. It's the future. It's the right thing to do. It helps everyone. https://t.co/hxyGBdWHH0
The cruelty of this administration never ceases. Thousands of El Salvadorans call Maryland home, and Marylanders know them as our neighbors. They built families here and are a core part of our communities. https://t.co/0pjR3pYx23 https://t.co/4ml41O6aaV
Thank you to the women leading the #TIMESUP movement &amp; pushing all of us to do better. This is a moment of reckoning, &amp; it cannot be just about fixing Hollywood &amp; boardrooms. We must protect people of every gender identity, race &amp; class in every zip code. https://t.co/OPOkpYy6UW

Small businesses like craft breweries are the backbone of our economy. It shouldn't require an army of lobbyists, lawyers and accountants to succeed, but right now that's what's required with the regulations we have imposed. It's government's job to level the playing field. https://t.co/SU8KyxtXtu
Too often, we see politicians stacking the deck for the biggest businesses. Just look at the craft beer industry in Maryland, and it's easy to see how the government just gets in the way of innovation. https://t.co/34uVNZSTfS https://t.co/Aa1upLuVDy
Hey @JeffSessions. Mellow out. Seriously. https://t.co/JduBOPEl8k
@jlogic @BaltCitySchools They put in 19% of the $ and get 11% out of it
@davidstein65 I agree. I've been outspoken about this. The perception and reality of MoCo are two different things. 30% of students speak English as 2nd language. 55,000 students on free lunch, nearly as many as Baltimore City. MoCo is getting screwed right now. Read:  https://t.co/6sDjhfH0Oa
If we can't fix @BaltCitySchools' problems now, then inequity in education funding will persist. Places like Montgomery Co. are getting screwed‚Äî putting more money in than they get out.  As governor, I will reorder our budget to get us to equity in funding within 4 years. Period.
This infrastructure issue is about more than just @BaltCitySchools in the winter. During the summer months, east Baltimore County students are sweltering in buildings that lack A/C.
Baltimore City is the biggest city in the wealthiest state. The money to solve this once and for all exists. It's a lack of will and innovative spirit in our current leadership.
This isn't a new issue either. This was happening 23 years ago when I was teaching. Enough is enough. We need a multi-year, multi-billion dollar plan to fix school infrastructure across Maryland.
This issue is personal to me. Felicity is a @BaltCitySchools educator, and our three kids are BCPS students. It's absurd that they cannot go to school because our infrastructure is crumbling.
4. Use money from the state‚Äôs rainy day fund for emergency repairs to boilers and to buy heaters and blankets to supplement while repairs are in progress.
3. We need to make sure the kids who depend on free and reduced lunches still get fed. So let's open the Baltimore Armory as a staging location to prepare breakfast and lunch.
2. Make sure our kids can get there safely by increasing the bus schedule to ensure kids aren't waiting for too long in the freezing cold.
1. Local universities haven't started back yet. Let's call @JohnsHopkins, @LoyolaMaryland, @EubieBee, and @CoppinStateUniv and ask them to open up their classrooms for our students in the interim. https://t.co/N2JAMgr5iA
Now that all of the photo ops in front of @BaltCitySchools with no heat are over, it's time to stop pointing fingers and start finding solutions.  Here are a few ideas to get us started @LarryHogan, @MayorPugh50 and @SonjaSantelises:
The only Kush Jeff Sessions should worry about is Jared‚Äôs meeting with the Russians.  Leave the weed policy to those of us who don't think of 1950s Alabama as an ideal to return to. https://t.co/JduBOPEl8k
@matthewstoller @tomangell @repblumenauer My 10 pages on what I would do as Governor re marijuana legalization &amp; regulation https://t.co/QsiiXNXkeM
When I‚Äôm governor, we will legalize pot, and Jeff Sessions can explain to me why Maryland should hand millions in revenues over to the drug cartels. https://t.co/OuByyoDL9J
If Baltimore City were predominantly white and had voted for @LarryHogan, you can bet there would be plenty of state money to fix these furnaces. https://t.co/3G2hess7Em
@karesf 2. I taught at Booker T Washington Middle School and saw the inequity first hand. My kids see it every day. Here's a 10 page white paper with some of my very specific ideas for education in Maryland https://t.co/RzUbk2hNvB
@karesf 1. Karen, I'm running to put our kids first! By way of quick background, I'm a former 6th grade teacher @BaltCitySchools. Married the math teacher across the hall who 23 years later still an educator in city schools. 3 kids in BCPS. I'm running as Maryland Education candidate
@SocialWorkItOut @HarCoDemocrats @ydmwc @TU_Democrats @runforsomething @AllisonForAll Really fired up for you, Allison! I just made a contribution to your campaign. We need more people with your combination of head and heart running for office!!

Net neutrality has broad bipartisan support, and Congress should do their job and stop these rules from taking effect. But if we've learned anything about Republicans in Congress, we know they probably won't.
.@AjitPaiFCC is trying to stop that. The end of net neutrality could fundamentally change the internet as we know it and create a tiered internet. Pay more and go faster; pay less and go slow.
In 2007, I was on the phone with @lessig and @superwuster drafting what would become @POTUS44‚Äôs net neutrality policy. We focused on net neutrality because it was clear that the internet must be an open place that fosters entrepreneurship and innovation.
Last week, the FCC put the future of the internet at stake by undoing Obama-era net neutrality rules. This is an issue that I've worked on for a long time.

Of course, not everyone needs to be a developer, but it's increasingly important for kids to understand code. Our kids need to be ready for the industries of the future, and a strong computer science education must be part of that foundation. https://t.co/E58dmYHV5M /3
If you haven't already, take the time to try an #HourOfCode. It'll change the way you think about your computer. Code shouldn't be scary. In fact, it's the alphabet much of the future will be written in. Looking for where to start? Check out: https://t.co/r4bxFvJkTV /2
I know for a lot of people learning to code sounds intimidating, and it can be hard to know where to start. That's why #CSEdWeek is so important. It opens the door for people to get a sense of what computer science is all about. /1
It's not enough to legalize marijuana and say thousands are now eligible for expungement. We need to go a step further in providing justice by reaching out to everyone who was arrested or convicted in Maryland and support them through the process. https://t.co/kepYnaHyt4
Thankfully, she persisted. Now, she's a promising developer ready to change the industry from the inside. Last summer, she landed a top-tier internship at Facebook. She inspires me. Hear her story in this FB Live chat we did at @CodeintheSchool: https://t.co/UaseTOQkuo #CSEdWeek
In August, I heard from a young woman of color who told me that her high school computer science teacher discouraged her from learning to code. He told her that she "wasn't smart enough" to take the class and that it would be "a waste of her time." #CSEdWeek
@Adrian_UX Thank you! Honored.
Shout out to the fantastic chefs and entrepreneurs supporting this fight. Particularly happy to see my friend @ChefJoseAndres, fellow Baltimorean @DuffGoldman and the top-notch Maryland brewers of @DenizensBrewing standing up for equality.

Had a great chat on @Cooper4MD's podcast, included a discussion of the thousands of unfilled, good-paying job in Maryland for people who can code. Tune in and see why we need computer science education in our K-12 curriculum ‚Äî not just a #CSEdWeek. https://t.co/ioqLcKU0ai
It's great to see students and teachers excited about #CSEdWeek, but learning computer science shouldn't be isolated to a few days. We need K-12 students in every zip code to have access to computer science classes. Here's how we can do that in Maryland: https://t.co/E58dmYHV5M

What we should prioritize: Creative ways to increase tax revenue Reversing injustices Building safer communities  Here‚Äôs an idea that does all three: legalize marijuana. https://t.co/kepYnaHyt4
7/ To be blunt, this can‚Äôt be another instance of white men dominating a market (like we‚Äôve seen with medical marijuana in MD). Legalization must include a plan for building an inclusive market with proactive outreach to underrepresented entrepreneurs. https://t.co/4mpt0tT71t
6/ We know that many people are already using marijuana anyway. Creating a regulated market would make it safer for everyone. We can follow best practices on confronting public safety threats while also removing unsafe products from our state.
5/ We can reallocate millions of dollars spent on enforcement of antiquated laws to focus on serious threats. Instead of going after some college kids with a little pot on them, we should focus on building safer communities.
4/ But we can‚Äôt assume people will hear they‚Äôre eligible. When the government has every record, that's unacceptable. I'm calling for stronger expungement measures than any current legislation in Annapolis. We must proactively reach out and help those eligible through the process.
3/ Arrests and convictions for marijuana possession disproportionately harm people of color. Legalization will reverse many of our system‚Äôs injustices by making thousands more eligible to have their records cleared ‚Äî making it easier to get a job and participate in society. https://t.co/OL0thm1jFk
2/ Right now, there‚Äôs an estimated $800 million spent on marijuana in Maryland via the black market. Legalize, regulate and tax it, and we have a new revenue source that puts more money into our state and creates jobs. https://t.co/4mUvrL6VV1
Maryland needs a new, bold leader who fights to provide justice for all.  That's why today I'm pushing us to legalize marijuana because it is the right thing to do. It provides joint benefits ‚Äî social justice and economic opportunity. https://t.co/JduBOPEl8k

A few ways Republicans want to fund their tax giveaway to wealthy donors: -Eliminate individual mandate -Remove deduction to help teachers buy school supplies -Cut the deduction that helps people pay off student loans https://t.co/S7wIzR0ScR
We must tear down barriers to voting for people. Here's how we can secure and expand voting rights in Maryland: https://t.co/W8UgyCrBB3 https://t.co/QaUGX3dsYI
We can hope for a Democratic wave, or we can put in the hard work of organizing in every jurisdiction in Maryland and campaigning on the issues that matter most to Marylanders.  Our campaign is focused on the latter. Join us if you agree: https://t.co/SHy58HGcIV https://t.co/VxR6p1Utjn
As a teacher, I often used my savings to buy supplies for my students, and Felicity continues to do this today. Now Republicans want to eliminate a tax break for teachers buying school supplies to help pay for their tax giveaway. Morally bankrupt is right. https://t.co/2qFE8VZVMD
Well done, @RocklandsFarm. Neo-Nazis have no place in Maryland. https://t.co/zsK8bMNjZ2
Things felt bleak after last year's election. But @BarackObama's speech in January fired me up again. It was time to stop waiting for change and time to run for office myself. https://t.co/x4QHmpgc4b
This reform is long overdue. Maryland government is getting in the way and making it harder for these entrepreneurs to grow their businesses right now. https://t.co/JlD6rJlORL
@BT4u2c Striving. TBD whether it can get there
@jamie_love One word answer: yes.
Hope my staff is ready to eat tonight! I‚Äôm making rigatoni and meatballs, and Tehle is working on an apple pie for our Team Alec dinner. https://t.co/McH1xk9w9v
If you only remember two things from today: 1) I‚Äôve been a laborer, so I understand the issues you‚Äôre facing and will fight for you. 2) I'll bring a new face &amp; fresh ideas to Annapolis and use my experience working in the Obama administration to pass a progressive agenda for MD.
Thank you brothers and sisters of the Maryland @AFLCIO. It‚Äôs been an honor to spend the afternoon with you.
Let‚Äôs settle this once and for all ‚Äî our next governor must ensure that infrastructure deals always include project labor agreements.
I worked for minimum wage for 6 years, so I know what that‚Äôs like. It‚Äôs time for a statewide $15 minimum wage. Period.
Here are my top 3 priorities: 1. Bring back the red line. 2. Build the purple line. 3. Bring back the study to look at building a Second Bay Bridge to invigorate the Lower Shore's economy.
.@LarryHogan‚Äôs transportation plan wasn‚Äôt a plan ‚Äî it was a press release.
I don‚Äôt need a minute (or 280 characters) to answer this: I‚Äôm 110% against privatizing public services.
This is not a hypothetical based on a theoretical based on a maybe. I taught 6th grade in @BaltCitySchools. My wife is still an educator in @BaltCitySchools, and my three kids are @BaltCitySchools students. I see these issues every day.
I‚Äôm running because of the massive inequities in our schools. The quality of your education shouldn‚Äôt depend on the zip code you grow up in.
Excited to be at the Maryland @AFLCIO gubernatorial forum today. I think it‚Äôs time we open the doors for everyone and that starts with our laborers. https://t.co/jhFmZ6tO51
Loved seeing BTU members and Booker T. Washington alumni before the AFL-CIO forum in Pikesville. https://t.co/XrtVcazie5
Thanks to the innovators and entrepreneurs who joined me for our conversation at @Betamore.  Check out our full discussion here: https://t.co/EaGqD4bOH4 https://t.co/Qm1AQOlamB
We need to focus on solutions to the issues facing entrepreneurs and solutions that also help us build a more inclusive economy. Too many Marylanders are being left out and left behind right now.
Great idea: when you register your business in Maryland, you should get connected with a concierge-like service to help you connect with our state‚Äôs amazing resources.  Tune in to hear more like this: https://t.co/EaGqD4bOH4
And this isn‚Äôt just about helping the flashy tech companies. Small businesses need these resources even more.
Even our leading entrepreneurs don‚Äôt know about every services or opportunity available in Maryland. Why aren‚Äôt we providing a central hub with all of this information?
Our state does a bad job of listening to leaders like @JulieVerratti. As she said, Maryland needs to be focused on ‚Äúmore carrots and fewer sticks‚Äù for small businesses.
I completely agree with @arobinson55 of @innovate4bmore. We have old regulations getting in the way because they weren‚Äôt written with tomorrow‚Äôs economy in mind.
What should government do to better support our craft brewers?  ‚ÄúGet out of the way.‚Äù ‚Äî@JulieVerratti of @DenizensBrewing

My sincerest sympathies to Detective Suiter's family and the entire @BaltimorePolice Department. Thank you for continuing to put your lives on the line every day. We must come together as a community to build a safer, stronger Baltimore.
Closing for religious holidays or spring break is a choice @MCPS shouldn't have had to make. We need to give our local districts complete control over their school calendar again. https://t.co/QOJ2sQkRCv

Our efforts can still help us land industry giants like Amazon, but it will also build stronger communities where small businesses and startups can start and grow. By working together, others will notice and decide to relocate here. /5
What's happening in College Park should serve as an example to the rest of the state and country. We must make smarter investments that support growth across our community to build a more inclusive economy. /4
Ken and his team also realize that creating a vibrant community goes beyond just investing in business; they have worked with local partners to strengthen public transit, education and quality of life throughout the community. /3
They've been highly intentional about where they develop, who they recruit as key partners &amp; how they allocate resources. A quick look at what they are doing is proof that economic development requires a plan beyond throwing out tax cuts &amp; incentives to attract big companies. /2
You have to check out what's happening in College Park. I got a tour from @KenUlman last week, and it is almost unrecognizable compared to a few years ago. We discussed economic development and how they are working to turn the area into a major hub for entrepreneurs. /1 https://t.co/sm30w34Hid

@mddems We‚Äôll do this while running in all 24 jurisdictions. We can‚Äôt just focus on the I-95 corridor. We can‚Äôt take our voters for granted.
@mddems We can‚Äôt do this with tweet sized policy. We need to talk about the big picture but ground it in real world specific solutions.
@mddems We can‚Äôt ignore people who don‚Äôt go to college. We need to make sure MD is not a state where you go to college or you work for minimum wage.
@mddems My #1 priority is strengthening public education. Fully funding k-12 education, making college affordable, &amp; apprenticeships/tech education.
Great to be with the @mddems this morning! Democrats are fired up for 2018! https://t.co/lA7K2UC0No
Imagine what we could accomplish if government worked as hard to support local business as it did to win #AmazonHQ2. https://t.co/vkIFtaftcz https://t.co/GrOhXTnz89
6/ Attracting #AmazonHQ2 would be huge, but if we support our entrepreneurs &amp; small biz owners, we could find the next Amazon already here.
5/ Growth and investment opportunities can create an inclusive economy that supports underserved people ‚Äî incl. women, POC, and immigrants.
4/ Between our universities and NIH and NSA, we have a huge pool of knowledge workers. They could be founding and funding Maryland startups.
3/ MD put in 6 bids for #AmazonHQ2. I bet we could accomplish even more if we put that effort into helping entrepreneurs &amp; small biz owners.
2/I know because I experienced it. From founding One Economy to advising startups today, I've seen how gov't fails to support entrepreneurs.
1/ Government focuses too much on just luring big businesses and not enough on growing Maryland-based businesses. https://t.co/vkIFtaftcz

4. The opioid crisis is hitting hard here. This ties back to the lack of economic opportunity ‚Äî fueling hopelessness and drug abuse.
3. One woman's daughter asked to live with a relative in Queen Anne‚Äôs County instead because she knew the schools were in better shape.
@calicobayfarm Awful to hear that. I'm committed to paying attention to overlooked communities that have lacked investment and caring.
2. Lansdowne &amp; Patapsco High Schools are rundown and overcrowded. They said students and teachers struggle with these classroom conditions.
1. People are frustrated and angry here. They told me that Dundalk has been left behind and forgotten by @BaltCoGov and @StateMaryland.
Great to chat with folks at the Boulevard Diner in Dundalk today. Some of my takeaways from our conversation: https://t.co/PCBS0EPn5g
This must be our next governor's top priority. As a former teacher, championing public education will be at the core of my administration.
It is a big part of why I'm running for governor. We need equitable funding to ensure every student is prepared for tomorrow's economy.
While I'm disappointed, we must get this right. This is a once-every-15-year chance to reset how we fund education. https://t.co/yYKqcALxLN

I don't do tweet-sized policy. Check out our issues page to see all of the ideas we've already proposed. https://t.co/ZrD5adhzCr
We should also create more professional paths for teachers that help them stay in the classroom instead of having to consider new careers.
One way to help solve this is to hire more support staff ‚Äî including counselors, teacher aides, social workers, psychologists, and nurses.
We hire our teachers to teach, yet we cut the support they need to help them focus on educating our kids. https://t.co/hb9BD2fuGa

Have a question about my election reform plan? Don't forget to submit it before my Facebook Live Q&amp;A tomorrow! https://t.co/UeCoYurw9O
5/ Marylanders deserve a fair vote, but the system is rigged to limit their voices &amp; choices. My plan changes that. https://t.co/o2DFO3jPP6
4/Closed primaries limit voices &amp; reduce the competition of ideas outside the establishment. We need a process to re-evaluate our primaries.
3/ We also need to rethink our primaries. Independents deserve a say in the process. Right now, too few voters are choosing our nominees. https://t.co/jU2tdtptJt
2/ Gerrymandering is part of this. It is unfair, unjust and anti-democratic. We need an independent commission to draw districts.
1/Our politics have become too polarized. Voters are turned off by a broken and rigged system. Too many people feel their vote won't matter.
For those asking why I want to restore voting rights to the incarcerated, check this out for my explanation: https://t.co/AJ7o4gPJRb
6/ My plan ensures government actively works to make voting easier. See for yourself to dig into the policy weeds. https://t.co/o2DFO3jPP6
5/ 15,000 Marylanders are disenfranchised in the criminal justice system. Let's restore their right to vote. They deserve to have a voice.
4/ It's far too difficult for college students to vote. We should let them vote where they live for most of the year, on campus.
3/ Why aren't we more proactive with online tools? We should provide email and SMS alerts about registration status and key voting dates.
2/ We must remove barriers to voting ‚Äî starting with expanded early voting, automatic voter registration &amp; a universal vote-by-mail option.
1/ When it comes to voting, we can't keep relying on @MarcEElias for a good defense. We need to play offense and expand the right to vote.
Keep those affected by this tragedy and the first responders in mind today as we continue to learn more. https://t.co/ix32wrcGEt

We're changing the conversation about voting. My election reform plan puts us on offense in expanding voting rights. https://t.co/AJ7o4gPJRb
@MileahKromer I'd prefer to coordinate with other states but if that's not possible then yes, Maryland should still lead the way
5/ If you want to dig into the weeds, check out my full plan to defend, secure and expand voting rights in Maryland. https://t.co/BUKgs5aFaQ
4/ We should also explore online voting. It can be done securely while massively reducing the barrier for participation.
3/ We need secure technology, risk-limiting security procedures, and rigorous audits that are the same for every vote cast in Maryland.
2/ Maryland's election system was among the 21 states targeted by Russian hackers. While we have a strong foundation, we must go further.
1/ We saw unprecedented attacks on our democracy in 2016. Making our ballot boxes and campaigns secure is a matter of national security.
@MileahKromer BTW, if you want to really geek out there's more content here https://t.co/BUKgs5aFaQ    Geeky white paper here https://t.co/USelAd61SX
It is not enough for it to be easier to vote. My election reform plan makes it hard NOT to vote in Maryland. https://t.co/BUKgs5aFaQ
@DaveLandymore Thanks, Dave. I'm not following any formula. Running a different kind of campaign. That's what will win and it's what is right...

2. I'll make public education my top priority. 3. We'll campaign in all 24 jurisdictions of Maryland 4. I'll beat @LarryHogan.
Here are my promises if you nominate me: 1. I won't do tweet-sized policy. I'll be thorough &amp; focus on the details. https://t.co/ZrD5adhzCr
If we re-elect @LarryHogan, he will continue the "Betsy DeVos-ization" of public education. We can't let that happen. #BlueMaryland
Maryland has never had a governor whose top priority is education. If you elect me, I promise that it will be my number one issue.
Thanks @RushernBaker. I wish we were both as funny as @LarryHogan‚Äôs transportation plan.
@LarryHogan Are we the kind of state that has rich people roads and poor people roads? We can‚Äôt solve congestion with toll roads.
(I love my interns though, and they are better than @LarryHogan‚Äôs).
Larry Hogan‚Äôs transportation plan is like a plan written by the interns that morning.
Until we have universal health care where a child‚Äôs life doesn‚Äôt depend on his parent‚Äôs health insurance, we aren‚Äôt the country we can be.

It's embarrassing that we don't have universal health care in America. The ACA was a critical step, but we need universal coverage.
If Democrats continue to denigrate those who don‚Äôt go to college and ignore their real needs, we‚Äôll continue to lose voters.
Without broadband connectivity, our businesses lack the basic infrastructure they need to succeed.
If we want to help the Eastern Shore move forward, here are two steps: 1. Broadband internet 2. Training in the skilled trades #BlueMaryland
üëã @bluelivesmtr and @Veteran4Trump https://t.co/9JesWfy4yV
We need to protect all Marylanders. It's time to stop ICE's overreach in our communities. Immigrants make us stronger. #BlueMaryland
Please remember the hurricane victims that are still in need right now. If you can, help support the relief efforts. https://t.co/TiQ4xOWMGW
After the Haiti earthquake, I worked with my @StateDept team to raise over $40 million with a text to give program. https://t.co/9paTsKppL7
The @United4Maryland Forum is starting! Excited to join everyone and share my ideas to solve the issues facing our state. #BlueMaryland https://t.co/FzWErUJhsO
@teachlandrews See you soon!
@United4Maryland I‚Äôve been to 3 towns this AM &amp; one thing that resonates w/ everybody is the need for investing in technical education &amp; apprenticeships.
Next stop is the Kensington Farmers market to meet with market-goers and get a quick bite to eat before the @United4Maryland forum. https://t.co/1kwCDifcdk
Excited to start the day at Getty Park in Silver Spring to talk about my campaign (and visit the farmers market!). https://t.co/PPUNtamP57
Trump is trying to sabotage health insurance and hurt families. Grateful @BrianFrosh is fighting for Marylanders. https://t.co/5Eg0L7mMXj
@ctcabin I was pleased to be a sponsor (the only gubernatorial candidate) of their event last night where they raised $100,000. Love them
@ctcabin One thing I believe we should do is support Emerge Maryland, which I am pleased to have done. Thanks for engaging on this important issue!
Thank you to @SenatorBarb for always fighting for Marylanders. It was a privilege to help honor her at tonight's @EmergeMaryland event. https://t.co/El5bzR2U1D
Had a great time with Progressive Neighbors on Monday. Looking forward to @United4Maryland Forum Saturday. Join me: https://t.co/Bwrsqv22i2 https://t.co/kRRzQfthOY
@realDonaldTrump You're expanding Obamacare?!
I absolutely would join the Climate Alliance as governor. If @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans won't step up, we will.
We absolutely need to elect more women. That's why I'm sponsoring @EmergeMaryland's event and hope to see you there: https://t.co/IDVR69NKhs
We need to invest more in mass transit in Maryland. We need to build the Purple Line and find a solution to the Red Line.
How will I beat @LarryHogan? It starts with running in all 24 jurisdictions. The same old won't work ‚Äî that's why I'm bringing new ideas.
As a former teacher, I know the importance of education. Learn more about my plans here: https://t.co/P9iQHVrFWV
We need to create more pathways forward. For too long, Democrats have said: ‚ÄúYou go to college, you‚Äôre a winner. You don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre a loser.‚Äù
I was lucky to go to college because of a woman named Becky the Barbarian (hi mom!).
I‚Äôll be rolling out my election reform platform on Thursday. Sign up now to be the first to see it. https://t.co/YUOXEgvGCq
I'm in favor of public financing for campaigns, but we need to go farther. We need to get corporate money out of politics as well.
We need a $15/hr minimum wage in Maryland. I worked for minimum wage to help put myself through college, and I know workers need a raise.
We need universal health care coverage in Maryland ‚Äî that means we need to stop playing just defense and go on offense in Annapolis.
Excited to be in Silver Spring tonight with Progressive Neighbors talkings about the important issues impacting Maryland. https://t.co/j1ddIhr8HP

Happy birthday, Colton! Wonderful evening celebrating with family. I can't believe I have a 15-year-old now. https://t.co/0h2sjyE4wM
@RyanRMiner Commonsense gun regulations. Magazine size restrictions. Ammunition sales restrictions. Background checks. No fly/no buy.
4/ We can't wait. We deserve action on commonsense gun reform now before more people die.
3/ Gun violence isn't just mass shootings. Baltimore is on pace for over 300 murders in 2017. 93 people die per day from guns in the US.
2/ People always say we'll debate the issue "later." When is later? In 16 months, we've seen the two deadliest shootings in US history.
1/ The victims of the Las Vegas shooting are in our thoughts and prayers. But what about the people who will die in the next tragedy?
This is heartbreaking. My condolences to the victims and their loved ones, and thank you to the first responders who handled the situation. https://t.co/3DsThN2FL7

5/ Call your senator today and every day until this bill dies. I know we are not a country that plays games with people's lives.
4/ We have to fight harder now. We cannot get complacent or let Republicans think we've stopped watching.
3/ Graham-Cassidy is somehow worse than their proposal in July, but they somehow seem even closer to passing it.
2/ That's why I shared my son's story in July ‚Äî the first time we had to have this fight. And here we are again. https://t.co/CPLSMqSnRP
1/ So often in this health care debate, we forget or ignore the voices of the people that would be affected.
@robbrulinski Just wrong. Now you can see why I'm running.
I couldn't run for governor without my family's support. I'm grateful Felicity shared this letter about our journey. https://t.co/0aI3yfohry
L‚ÄôShana Tovah to all who are celebrating the new year throughout Maryland and the United States.
1. My 10 year-old son Sawyer is alive today because we have health insurance. If we didn't he might have died.   https://t.co/NrgUy4lEjq
2. Privileged members of Congress trading others' health coverage for their tax breaks is disgusting #GrahamCassidy  https://t.co/NrgUy4lEjq
Thanks for hosting me tonight, @BaltCoDemParty! Loved the engaging dialogue and hearing your ideas to build a stronger Maryland. https://t.co/FXjAghGfwo
Doctors swear an oath to "do no harm." The same standard should apply to Republicans and their attempts to take away our health care.
Agreed, boss. We can make universal CS education a reality. Here's how: https://t.co/RlE2W3PYAx https://t.co/fk61qqBfo1
This is not a game. Do not stop calling until this bill is dead: (202) 224-3121 https://t.co/UB1xdOM7cs
Get all of the details at https://t.co/1nlCVp5eda, and reply here to let me know which courses you think our students need. https://t.co/kURDRsS4bu
I proposed the Maryland Online Academy to do this. With this program, kids across MD can take advanced courses ‚Äî no matter their school.
Regardless of their ZIP code, Maryland's high school students deserve access to a broad set of AP, foreign language, and STEM courses.
This campaign is about making sure every Marylander has an opportunity to succeed, but I can't do it alone. Join me: https://t.co/YUOXEgvGCq https://t.co/1eTJcxxCTS
Marylanders shouldn't have to worry that Trump will take away their health care. We need universal health care and lower premiums now.
Nobody should be making less than $15 an hour in the state of Maryland.
Thank you to @unitehere Local 7 for hosting tonight's forum. Excited to answer your questions and talk about real solutions for Marylanders. https://t.co/reD5PkkCSn
Democrats won't win with slogans. People want new ideas that help them succeed. My education platform does that: https://t.co/lIcMayBviE
@tatr Thank you for your resistance to Betsy DeVos. I support the @EubieBee students, alum &amp; faculty who say #NeverDeVos.
@jaisalnoor See DM
@jaisalnoor Good meeting you today. Never hesitate to get in touch!
I agree that the University has a right to promote intellectual diversity, but inviting her to speak at graduation is an insult to students. https://t.co/K1YaQhTJkl
I'm joining @EubieBee students in solidarity to ask the University to rescind its invitation to Betsy DeVos to be the commencement speaker. https://t.co/OCC4HuHolo
Still in awe of the first responders' bravery 16 years ago. Let's remember that, no matter our divisions, we're all Americans. #NeverForget
My wife just spoke with a 1st year teacher @BaltCitySchools with 43 students in one class, 45 in another.   Horrendous inequity. #MDpolitics
We need to keep Betsy DeVos out of public education in Maryland. Tell @EubieBee to find a new commencement speaker: https://t.co/deHcV9aznB https://t.co/mgJQKc4pW1
Betsy DeVos has spent her career trying to destroy public education. The University of Baltimore's decision is an insult to their students. https://t.co/i0tFQpKD5E
I have PLENTY of thoughts on @BetsyDeVos being invited to speak at the @EubieBee. Here are a few:  https://t.co/xNYF9HFrie
Either @LarryHogan is blind to importance of @WMATA to MD‚Äôs economy or he doesn't care. I'm guessing the latter.   https://t.co/NGhPXR4jBd

@Chim_27 DM me?
As governor, I will dig into policy and listen to educators because when it‚Äôs your kid‚Äôs future, the details matter. https://t.co/1nlCVp5eda
.@LarryHogan ignores research and passes policy that hurts students because he thinks the beach is more important.¬†https://t.co/VbehZN3Tf6
From investing in pre-K to college affordability, we have a lot of work. We need big ideas and a leader who brings everyone to the table.
We need fresh ideas and a new vision to fix our system's inequities. So that's what I'm proposing. https://t.co/1nlCVp5eda

Fantastic afternoon at the @HoCoDemParty's Labor Day picnic. Can definitely feel the grassroots energy. They're ready to take back Maryland! https://t.co/ggOVgdPaOJ
As we celebrate #LaborDay, let's remember that the federal minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009. Just $7.25/hr.   Time to #FightFor15.
I‚Äôve seen the value of unions from my time as a midnight janitor to working on a beer truck to being a public school teacher. https://t.co/E6XP0KLYrH
Happy Labor Day! Enjoying a day off or a barbecue with friends and family? Thank the US labor movement for years of fighting for workers.
Ending DACA is breaking the promise we made to 800k DREAMers. America is their home. They deserve to feel safe here. https://t.co/Qa2WI6qMgP https://t.co/3C7I0gvGbp

@maisyannadams Thank you!!
Who Would Be Impacted By Massive Medicaid Cuts in a Republican #HealthcareBill? https://t.co/MuRjtOu7kP
@Kaffe_Takk Thank you
8/ In the next elections voters need to END the careers of Republicans trading poor and working class' #healthcare for tax cuts for the rich
7/ That a group of privileged members of Congress are trading other people's health insurance for tax breaks is a sign of a damaged America.
6/ The inequity: you have $ and insurance, your 10 year-old son lives. You don't have $ and insurance your 10 year-old son dies. #Healthcare
5/ Stunning to me that our son is only alive because he was born to privileged parents who can afford quality health insurance in America.
4/ This is only because we had health insurance. If we didn't, no great primary care doctor, genetic test, plan of care and surgery.
3/ Because of our health insurance and my wife's advocacy, our son got world-class care and had successful surgery. He's alive and well.
2/ The results of the tests were not good. A genetic mutation that meant there was a high % his tumors were malignant &amp; life-threatening
1/ Earlier this year, my 10 year-old son's doctor found tumors in his thyroid. Because we have good health insurance, he quickly got testing
Pretty sick that members of Congress voting to strip millions of Americans of health insurance all get taxpayer funded insurance themselves https://t.co/oUhf41gHTP

Average Annual Cost in Maryland:   Public College Tuition $9,163 Childcare $14,726  My childcare plan:  https://t.co/JRQbVYiw9j  #MDpolitics
@mcbyrne No other candidate is talking about this issue or within miles of where I am in terms of public investment
@mcbyrne In addition to that, I propose putting 10s of millions a year into increasing subsidies for lower income families.
@mcbyrne So in what I propose the "debt" is gone in a fixed # amount of time, does not have compounding interest and goes away even if income gone.
@mcbyrne Agree re UPK but child care problems don't stop when kids are off to kindergarten. Need solutions for kids aged 5-14, too. Hence my policy.
@MsShade So you are saying that any proposal other than 100% universal, 100% free is bad?
@BeauInMaryland Headline wrong. It's not a loan. It's a subsidy for low income households then an income share agreement. Check out https://t.co/sZsV9vZG29
@MsShade It's tens of millions of additional dollars going into child care grants plus resources for slightly higher earners that don't now exist
@MsShade My proposal massively increases child care subsidies for low income families and an income share program for working class earners
Expect more of this from me: feminism + innovation to help working women and their children.  https://t.co/qJ01HtR5iE
At the core of my Child Care Policy is an "Income Share Agreement", where working Moms pay back a fixed % of income vs accumulating debt. https://t.co/azOKYxLpwC
9. Thank you and please read my childcare plan here https://t.co/JRQbVYiw9j https://t.co/LK7NDu2I6S
8. We need to increase the availability, affordability, and quality of childcare in Maryland and I have an innovative plan to do it.
7. These working Moms &amp; Dads (mostly moms) having to solve this don't have lobbyists in Annapolis. As Governor, I will be their champion.
6. 90%+ of child care centers are unaffordable for working families, forcing kids into low quality facilities or parents out of work force.
5. Since @LarryHogan became Governor, household income max to receive a child care subsidy has DROPPED from $30,000 to $23,000. That's cruel
4. Average Annual Public College Tuition in Maryland: $9,163.   Average Annual Cost of Child Care: $14,726 https://t.co/9fAJBrp7kR

@BaltCitySchools More crime. More teen pregnancy. Less readiness for jobs. The cycle of poverty continues. Pay now (for teachers &amp; counselors) or pay later.
@BaltCitySchools When we don't adequately fund public education and we fire outstanding counselors like Ms. Bookman, what you get in the future is more crime
@BaltCitySchools But here's the thing: my outrage isn't @BaltCitySchools district. Current senior leadership is strong. The fault is in systemic $ inequity
@BaltCitySchools Ms. Bookman is 1 of 15 counselors, and 1 of @BaltCitySchools staff who were terminated because of budget cuts.
@BaltCitySchools Ms. Bookman also established a high-impact mentoring program for girls that has proven to be game-changing in their lives.
@BaltCitySchools Ms. Bookman is young but experienced (5 years counseling). A force for equity &amp; inclusion. Attended Johns Hopkins. She guided my oldest son https://t.co/7lrqTUSLFS

@MoCoWomen1 @RISE_stronger @LarryHogan @RogerManno Trump's budget is cruel. Disgusting. I'm waiting to hear @LarryHogan condemn it. He needs to. Again my values and those of Maryland.
Today only 40% of #Maryland schools have Computer Science courses. As Governor, I‚Äôll raise that to 100%. https://t.co/tncjPLBLem #CS4MD

To bring #CS4All in MD we need a self-sustaining pipeline of CS educators. Read more here: https://t.co/tncjPLBLem #CS4MD https://t.co/77pMvS6QDq

Only 25% of computing jobs are held by women &amp; only 25% of all AP Comp Sci students in MD are female. To change this we need #CS4All in MD

Today's #Trumpcare101: Under TrumpCare, the elderly can be charged 5x more than younger Americans.
Connor from Pasadena wants to protect Maryland's Medicaid expansion. What do you think? https://t.co/jaJZrjvPiy #IdeasforMD
üëèüëèüëè https://t.co/btUCDqsk6f
It's been one week since #Trumpcare and we still haven't heard anything from @LarryHogan. Shameful, but not surprising. #WheresLarry
#Trumpcare101: Victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse could be denied access to affordable care while their attackers receive it.
This is just the first step towards ripping health care from hundreds of thousands of Marylanders.
He's scared to say it, but this shows that @LarryHogan is fine with @realDonaldTrump's extreme tactics and won‚Äôt stand up for Maryland.
Rather than standing up for MDers, @LarryHogan has named a right wing ideologue to chair MD‚Äôs healthcare commission.¬†https://t.co/znPQUiJYqu
We've finally heard from @LarryHogan on healthcare.
Today‚Äôs #Trumpcare101: TrumpCare guts 100s of billions of dollars from Medicaid &amp; Medicare so that Republicans can cut taxes for the rich
So while all the pretty ribbons are being cut and backs-slapped, I'm going to keep asking #WheresLarry?
But here's the thing: governing = more than ribbon cutting. In Maryland with #Trumpcare it means 300,000+ people losing healthcare.
.@LarryHogan has strengths. NOBODY does more ribbon cuttings. If he has callouses on his hands, it's from cutting all those pretty ribbons
How did @LarryHogan respond to a health care bill that could affect millions of Marylanders? ¬† ***CRICKETS*** ¬† So I'm asking #WhereIsLarry?
Other Republican Governors aren't scared to stand up for what is right:¬†https://t.co/Rcki4DXE4h
I live in Maryland and am running for Governor against incumbent Republican @LarryHogan and on #Trumpcare he won't say a word about it.
Serious question: what is the point of being a Governor if you aren't going to engage on the really big, consequential policy issues?
3/ Under Trumpcare, lifetime caps on coverage can be reinstated, including for babies and children born with health issues. #TrumpCare101
2/ everyday I am going to tweet one of the countless horrors contained within this so-called healthcare bill. Let's call it #TrumpCare101
1/ Since @realDonaldTrump is definitely too clueless to know what's in #Trumpcare, and @LarryHogan doesn't seem to care...
It is difficult for me to understand the mindset of the men - and it was all men - who created a bill so vicious to women. https://t.co/baDoWZbZUr
Maryland deserves a governor that will stand up to @realDonaldTrump, yet @LarryHogan remains silent as they threaten healthcare for millions https://t.co/206ZgqwzDY
@jjmccool @BaltCitySchools I don't disagree with you but simple, sad, sick fact = the students I taught at Booker T had real problems. That's who I'm speaking out for.
@jjmccool @BaltCitySchools The kids I taught had challenges and problems. I taught these kids. Not going to sugarcoat it. That's why I'm speaking out.
1 I taught 6th graders @BaltCitySchools designated for special education services. They were often lead-poisoned &amp; had other severe problems
2. These young people need our help. Without it, they are vulnerable to the worse possible futures imaginable.   https://t.co/RAeDfiVAep
3. The cuts proposed in #Trumpcare for Medicaid-eligible students would be devastating to disabled students in Maryland and their families.
4 I know this is geeky/wonky stuff, but we need to care about it, and care about these children. Read this @nytimes: https://t.co/RAeDfiVAep
.@LarryHogan 3. @LarryHogan must immediately condemn his fellow Republicans actions on Trumpcare. Anything less is shameful.   #WheresLarry
.@LarryHogan 2. About 313,000 Marylanders will lose health coverage under Trumpcare. Since the taxpayers pay for @LarryHogan's health coverage, he won't
1. Governor @LarryHogan has high-quality health insurance compliments of Maryland's taxpayers. That's good. He deserves it.
Trumpcare: Rape is a pre-existing condition. Domestic abuse is irrelevant.  @LarryHogan: **crickets**  #WheresLarry
Under Trumpcare, 2.5 million Marylanders (incl. 320k kids) with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage. #WheresLarry
Under Trumpcare, Maryland families could see their costs increase by $3788 per year in 2020. #WheresLarry¬†https://t.co/eUUlH4tvcb
While @realDonaldTrump and republicans try to take healthcare from millions of Americans, @LarryHogan remains silent. #WheresLarry

@jaamidor thank you. Will read.
@aseaborne Look, we aren't going to change anything if we can't persuade more people (who are persuadable) to support us. Way elections work
@aseaborne Trump lost by millions. Congressional Republicans did not
@aseaborne Check your math
@aseaborne sorry to say this but Congress is run by the democratically elected majority party. Simple fact.
@aseaborne and where was Jim Crow most effectively protested?? In the south, not San Francisco. Cradle of Jim Crow
@aseaborne as long as these folks keep winning elections the policies will just get worse.
@aseaborne public pressure on elected officials. And the likes of LBJ ELECTED over Goldwater. JFK over Nixon
@aseaborne because in a democracy you have to win elections to change policies. Jim Crow ended by people elected to Congress

@michaelstanton1 trust me, Trump's indelicate straight talk is part of his appeal where I'm from
@michaelstanton1 yeah, but delicate overly-parsed language = more "talking down" than straight talk. These are my people
@michaelstanton1 Except that those of us who are from Wal-Mart country think that speaking too delicately = part of why not connecting
@aoindependence It's not a putdown. It's factually accurate. I was born and raised in West Virginia. I know what I'm talking about.
@aoindependence - exactly. If progressives think people in the White House are sweating the protests, they're wrong  https://t.co/25cr55ABLE
@RonWechsler That's right. The movement toward more closed societies is an innovation and growth killer. Thanks for the good words re book.

@JasonKapler I'm hearing plenty of surprise. But hey, troll away big fella
@JasonKapler anybody who is "surprised" was either not paying attention or naive
@JasonKapler I'm not missing the point. There is a difference in meaning between "alarm" and "surprise".
I'm surprised by how many people are surprised by Trump's #MuslimBan.  He said he would do this. Elections have consequences. More to come.

@dan_munz The sickness is the gazillion $ of taxpayer dollars flushed down toilet &amp; inefficient government services @digiphile @pahlkadot

@dan_munz And I'm not convinced IT regs/regulators are really in the business of preventing corruption anymore. @digiphile @pahlkadot
@dan_munz I'll happily de-regulate and give away current level of oversight. Wasting countless billions.  @digiphile @pahlkadot
@ski The corruption, if that's the right word, is the mass misuse of taxpayer dollars because of these regs. @digiphile @pahlkadot
