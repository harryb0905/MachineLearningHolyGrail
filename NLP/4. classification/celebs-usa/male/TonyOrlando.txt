Hey you guys! I'm at American Idol!
Enjoying LA with my family! Going to the American Idol finale on Wednesday! Who's gonna win? Lee or Crystal?

Big Mike, you were my favorite of the night! And Lee and Crystal!
Just got done watching American Idol!
@TheEllenShow, the B3 bugged me too! It did get in the way of Lee's opening of "That's Life."
Great run of shows in Laughlin this weekend! Vegas next!
"To Be With You" by David Archuleta...Not only an incredible performance by him, but one of the greatest songs I've heard in a long time!
I was just listening to Kara DioGuardi's body of work in music and writing. This is not only a serious judge on Idol, but a serious talent!
I think it's time for the judges on American Idol to be judged for once!
Why is it called 7-11? Shouldn't they change it to 24- 7 since it's open 24 hours?
Thank you all for the birthday wishes! I love you all!
