@GavinNewsom By the way, my big examination of the Kevin Cooper case, arguing that he was probably framed, is here: https://t.co/ePBMaU4JEq
@GavinNewsom We also need to think institutionally. We now have two governors in a row who have, within two months, ordered DNA testing in the case--but only after 35 years. Journalists can't champion every case. One lesson is we need easier access in appeals to DNA testing generally.
@GavinNewsom Gov Jerry Brown had ordered limited DNA testing in the case before he left office, but neglected crucial evidence (such as the hairs found clutched in the victims' hands). Newsom's new executive order rectifies that. A step for justice for a man who has spent 35 years in prison.

The world should bet on Saudi Arabia's future, not on MBS's: The future of the country is more represented by Loujain al-Hathloul, the imprisoned women's rights activist, than by her torturer. The royal family will decide when the king dies, and Trump shouldn't protect MBS.
Yes, the crown prince talks a good game about economic reform. But I'm skeptical that he will deliver, for his vision doesn't seem practical. In the meantime his war on Yemen and torture of women's rights activists is devastating to Saudi Arabia's reputation.
The crown prince repeatedly has shown himself reckless and a source of instability in the region: his war in Yemen, feud with Qatar, kidnapping of Lebanon's PM, and murder of Khashoggi. Why does Pres Trump continue to embrace a crown prince who breaks everything he touches?

This is representative of the factual rigor of Trump's #SOTU: He said wages were rising the fastest "in decades." In fact, adjusted for inflation, they are rising at the fastest rate since August 2016. https://t.co/DsaiWSc0wK
Here's my quick take on Trump's #SOTU in a Facebook Live: https://t.co/enUamIjw6T
You‚Äôre right. I was wrong. I‚Äôll delete that tweet. https://t.co/NcuMBmyabM
I noticed that too. I think it's reflective of someone of Trump's generation trying to reach for a period of greatness. But President Franklin Roosevelt was an internationalist who tried to help ordinary workers; he was the opposite of Trump. https://t.co/huRHSYOuko
Exactly. Some people hate Jews. Some people hate Muslims. Some people hate refugees. Any kind of hatred and bigotry should be denounced. https://t.co/jgKoMDCN1C
President Trump is right that Iran is an oppressive, untrustworthy regime. But he meanwhile embraces another oppressive, untrustworthy regime--Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have also created the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Mr. President, how about a word about Yemen?
I'm surprised that Trump sounds so trusting of the Taliban. I agree that we should try to negotiate a peace and a withdrawal, but the Taliban is not monolithic and we should verify more than trust. #SOTU
It's sad to see the Venezuela issue so polarized. Trump is right that Maduro has been a catastrophe for Venezuela, and that Guaido would be much better. Democrats should appreciate that. But Trump administration talk about military options is crazy and just helps Maduro.
It's true that North Korea hasn't conducted a nuclear test or missile test, and that's good. But North Korea is still producing nuclear materials and still making nuclear weapons, and it's also apparently ramping up its biological weapons program.
This is ridiculous: Trump claims that if he had not been elected we'd be in a major war with North Korea. Zero evidence. Trump was the one who terrified the Pentagon leadership with his talk of attacking North Korea. #sotu
Good to hear Trump talk about paid family leave. The US lags behind the rest of the industrialized world on parental leave. But I'm skeptical that the Trump plan, if it's anything like what he has talked about before, will do much on this.
Trump manipulates humanitarians' data on sex trafficking to justify anti-humanitarian policies. #SOTU https://t.co/kgRdyqNlGG
A welcome Trump call to try to eliminate Aids in the US within 10 years. Bravo. But to do that we need to expand Medicaid and health care coverage, even as Trump and the GOP have tried to do the opposite. Without expanding health coverage, we can't beat Aids.
I agree with Trump's call to address drug prices. But figuring out how to do so is complicated. It was a huge mistake for Congress to bar Medicare from negotiating with drug companies on pricing for part D; that was a gift to drug companies of about $50 billion a year.
Here's another thing Trump is right about: The need for a new infrastructure bill. Instead of spending money on tax cuts for the rich, we should have spent it on desperately needed infrastructure.
Trump says that any China trade deal will have to include "real, structural change" in China, as well as reduce the US trade deficit.
Trump is noting that there are more women than ever in Congress. Hmm. Well, in some sense that is a national achievement that Trump is partly responsible for.
Remember that a full wall would cost $22 billion.  If we want to improve American wellbeing, how about using that sum for child care, for parental leave, for drug treatment, for job training, rather than for a wall?
It's so hypocritical for Trump to talk about sex trafficking as a motivation for the wall. I've interviewed those girls who were trafficked in Honduras--and Trump insists on sending those girls applying for asylum back to the Honduran traffickers.
Now Trump is presenting undocumented immigrants as murderers who want to slaughter us in our beds. Actually, researchers find undocumented workers commit crime at lower rates than native Americans.
I spent 25 years reporting on sex trafficking, which indeed a huge issue. But It's offensive when Pres. Trump tries to use this issue to justify his wall; a wall won't help. If he wants to go after sex traffickers, his Justice Department should prosecute pimps more aggressively.
"This is a moral issue," Trump says of immigration. Look, the real moral issue is that the Trump administration separated children from immigrant parents at the border, lost track of who was who, and now insists that it doesn't need to try to find the kids it lost.
Oh, no, Trump is talking again about the "onslaught" from caravans of immigrants. This is of course preposterous. There is no threat to American well-being from some hungry hikers in Honduras trying to flee gang violence by going north.
Pres. Trump says he wants to put drug traffickers and human traffickers out of business. So why not spend the $5.7 billion on means to address this, such as searches of the trucks that carry drugs across at official crossing points?
One thing Trump is right to claim credit for: criminal justice reform. That was a genuine bipartisan achievement. Mass incarceration was one of the worst mistakes America made, and I hope we can continue with the criminal justice reforms (like change the bail system). #SOTU
It's not "hatred": it's "accountability." That's what happens in a democracy. Presidents get fact-checked. https://t.co/MLcCrmByNa
Trump boasts about cutting back on regulations. This is a genuine achievement, along with appointments of conservative judges. But some of the regulations make it easier for companies to sell dangerous chemicals, such as chlorpyrifos, which damages children's brains. #SOTU
Trump is boasting of cutting back on Obamacare. The upshot is that the surge in the number of people becoming insured has ended. And for every 800 people who lack health insurance, about one dies each year. #SOTU Lack of health coverage is lethal.
Here's a full text of the #SOTU: https://t.co/H1E8ZOLb9Y
It‚Äôs true that the economy is strong. Unfortunately, this was financed by borrowing (partly from China) to give a tax cut to the rich. We now have roughly a $1 trillion deficit that our kids will have to pay back.
A bit incongruous to hear Pres Trump in #SOTU  call for bipartisan cooperation and putting country first. Oh, yes, today it‚Äôs TelePrompTer Trump. His Twitter twin is in a secure location.

@iambhutia it's unclear

@GuthrieGF Yeah, I've thought about writing about liberal evangelicalism. I think there is a really interesting generational divide within evangelicalism, with young people much more progressive. Two of t he interviews were with mild progressives, but no one yet on religious left.
I see these annual interviews as a way to create a civil conversation across the God Gulf, and for that it's important to reach out to people with more conservative religious views. About a quarter of Americans are evangelical, and I'm trying to understand their views better. https://t.co/rUDD6TgwG8
One element of the Saudi crown prince's continuing duplicity is his refusal to say where Jamal Khashoggi's body is and to allow burial of the remains. That's a ongoing insult to Jamal and his family, yet President Trump continues to embrace MBS, Mr. Bone Saw.

And the toll of guns has increased since Sandy Hook, not decreased. Almost 40,000 Americans now die annually from guns, including suicides, murders and accidents. We can't eliminate those deaths, but a serious effort could perhaps reduce gun deaths by 10,000 a year. Let's try. https://t.co/ArGbE9WGkQ

This is an excellent essay reminding us that Saudi Arabia's worsening human rights problem goes far beyond the murder of Khashoggi but also includes the detention of some 2,600 dissidents.

U.S. to stop refueling Saudi-coalition planes in Yemen, officials say. A hint of progress. But the US and UK are still complicit in Saudi/UAE war crimes in Yemen because of their weapons sales. We should suspend all weapons sales to Saudi/UAE.  https://t.co/qM5q5LKkgF
Isn't it odd that Trumpies call liberals "snowflakes" when it's President Trump himself who is so frightened of journalistic questioning that he bars a correspondent from the White House? I've covered lots of dictators who are fearful like that. They eventually melt and go away.
I think it's appalling that protesters threatened Tucker Carlson's family. Also that Christine Blasey Ford is being threatened and has had to move four times. And that Pres Trump sets a thuggish tone and calls journalists "enemies of the people." Violence is bad on all sides. https://t.co/t0ocmAM6aq

.@aliShihabi If MBS genuinely is innocent, then he should share the videotape that the team undoubtedly took of the "fistfight," call on the Turks to release the audio, and support an international investigation under UN auspices to clear him. https://t.co/eVPlcO3rhr
I agree with @RichardHaass. Saudi apologists say that this is one incident. But MBS is reckless and breaks everything he touches: His confrontation with Qatar, the kidnapping of the Lebanon prime minister, the war with Yemen. What happens if he triggers a war with Iran? https://t.co/coiAJcVmlF
@davidakaye @djrothkopf Yes indeed. I've linked to your excellent op-ed in my own calls for an international investigation.
Saudi propagandists are denouncing my column about Jamal's murder. So ask Turkey to release the tape! Also, Saudis typically video an operation like this, so release the video! But stop claiming that a journalist with no fingers left picked a fist fight: https://t.co/SWNweW4cwP

This is pathetic. We are collaborating in the cover-up. https://t.co/4dI23FcGly
Saudi intelligence would normally videotape an operation like the Khashoggi one. So, Mr. Mad Prince, show us your video of this "fist fight"!       The lies are sickening. I hope some country exercises universal jurisdiction and prosecutes those Saudis responsible.
The Saudi cover-up begins. The aim is to obfuscate and protect the Mad Prince by pinning this murder on fall guys. Will Trump join the cover-up? We will soon find out. https://t.co/1LyNuk6dEA

Trump and King Salman are mounting an investigation that reminds me of O.J. Simpson's search for the real killers. The Trump response to Jamal's murder simultaneously mocks human rights and insults our intelligence.
Ah, the story line has shifted. First, it was that Jamal had left the Saudi consulate after 20 minutes. Now something "took place in their Turkish Consulate." No doubt the culprits are those 15 "rogue" actors who invaded the consulate and consul's home with a bone saw? https://t.co/C41f68m5IU

Trump Says ‚ÄòRogue Killers‚Äô May Be Involved in Saudi Journalist Case https://t.co/SojAOpntUh Oh, right. Probably also "rogue kidnappers" who detained Lebanon's prime minister. And "rogue bombers" killing Yemeni children. There is indeed a rogue, but he's a prince.
ICYMI, my Sunday column argues that the US &amp; NATO allies should expel Saudi ambassadors and suspend weapons sales; businesses should skip the Riyadh conference. We should also advise the Saudi royal family that a murderer should not be crown prince:  https://t.co/GA3GvnhkQ2 https://t.co/qr3N1y8vL8
@BBassem7 Bassem, I've written repeatedly about the slaughter and starvation of Yemenis, most recently in my column yesterday. Not to mention in my last tweet.
Saudi Arabia has faced no consequences for kidnapping Lebanon's prime minister, for starving 8 million Yemenis, for imprisoning women's rights advocates, for funding extremist madrassas abroad--so it thought it could get away with murder as well. It's time for consequences.
Trump is sending Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to meet King Salman to discuss Jamal Khashoggi: https://t.co/SojAOpntUh Pompeo should make clear that unless Jamal promptly reappears, Saudi Arabia needs to find a new crown prince. There have to be consequences for murder.
.@LesleyRStahl did an excellent job in her Trump interview, and I recommend reading the transcript: https://t.co/nOImt42WgH Note that Trump still denies climate change, and that he acknowledges what his administration denied, that he split immigrant families to deter them.

@RogerPielkeJr @RyanMaue yes, in fairness it probably should. Although i do think that Emanuel knows more about hurricane intensity than just about anybody ever. But your point is taken.
@RogerPielkeJr Roger, i think your point is about frequency of hurricanes, rather than intensity, right? I didn't address the frequency issue (or stalling from blockages) partly because that is uncertain, while there's much more consensus on intensity, on higher seas, on more moist air. Right?

Some people feel sorry for Cosby, but we simply must end the impunity for sexual violence. It's great to try to change mores, but what really gets people's attention is the fear that they will end up in a jail cell. Fear molds behavior more than sensitivity training classes. https://t.co/uC0Cy59VUX
The sight of UN delegates laughing at Trump is garnering the most attention, and that's understandable. But an elevated risk of a war with Iran--perhaps being dragged in by Saudi Arabia and UAE--is no laughing matter.
I was almost deeply uneasy about the virulence of Trump's attacks on Iran, seeing it as the root of all evil. Yes, Iran badly violates human rights, as do our allies Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. But demonizing a country increases the risk of a war, and that's the last thing we need. https://t.co/R2z3KNpuiZ

It would have been nice if President Trump had denounced the political abuse of justice in Myanmar, against two reporters uncovering genocide, instead of calling for the political abuse of justice at home. https://t.co/LFX3rcV1kW
Whoa! President Trump is apparently saying that his Justice Department should time prosecutions (or avoid them) to benefit the Republican Party. Machiavelli would blush. https://t.co/LFX3rcV1kW
China in the past has protected others guilty of genocide, from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia to Sudan's Omar Bashir in Darfur. Will China again shield a genocide, this time by Myanmar against the Rohingya?
Myanmar's military and Suu Kyi argue that any killing of Rohingya was incidental by rogue troops or villagers. But by sending the two journalists to prison, they show the hand of the state in trying to suppress truth. This was a state operation from beginning to end.
It's unfortunate that Suu Kyi's Nobel Peace Prize can't be withdrawn and awarded instead to U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo for trying to blow the whistle on a likely genocide.
This is a good time to reread the extraordinary report by the two imprisoned reporters, U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo: https://t.co/2alGrO4lf3 It's a model of outstanding and courageous journalism, the kind that should win prizes, not prison cells.
Shame on Myanmar and Aung San Suu Kyi for sentencing two @Reuters journalists to seven years in prison for committing journalism and investigating their military's genocide against the Rohingya: https://t.co/LIadCml8lH They are political prisoners, just as Suu Kyi once was.

Hmm, Nikki Haley should examine poverty in America.

No, I don't favor open borders. And yes, immigration policy is hard, with difficult tradeoffs--but that doesn't excuse truly evil behavior like seizing babies from mothers' arms. https://t.co/uFeDQvkX11

Yup, the Trump administration is paying $775 per child per night after having ripped them from their parents' arms. I discuss in today's newsletter: https://t.co/1VlMfpu6xJ Follow the link in it for more. Trump won't fund other child programs, but he funds child abuse. https://t.co/aFeSCSOI8b

@DGreenbaum Oh, yes, I agree that conditions are utterly different, and I made that point in the column; I had relatives who died at Auschwitz. Nor is this the same as slavery. But the point is that each epoch has its apologists but that eventually these hr violations are just seen as evil.

But "zero tolerance" is inconsistent with ending family separation. If a parent is jailed for the misdemeanor of crossing the border (typically for about three days) then the parent can't take the child to jail. Ergo, they are separated. https://t.co/1rlSEVOp5Y

@joshtpm Trump himself probably didn‚Äôt know about CVID. But his aides didn‚Äôt expect anywhere anytime inspections. No one did. The authors of the Senate letter acknowledged privately that it was pissing on Trump diplomacy the way Rs had pissed on Iran deal.
@joshtpm But it insisted on anywhere anytime inspections, which everybody knew were impossible‚Äîand which were precisely the weapon republicans used to bash the Iran deal. No deal could ever pass muster.
@joshtpm What I objected to was Senate Democrats setting hurdles that could never be met, like anywhere anytime inspections. That meant that no deal would pass muster.

@ginsengity @JenGranholm I tweeted several times about Schneiderman, the night the story came out.
In the aftermath of the Eric Schneiderman revelations, read this important piece by @zoegberg about how women trying to flee abusive husbands sometimes face great difficulties getting a divorce. https://t.co/SpVNpvxcCa

At Sean Hannity properties in low-income areas, an aggressive approach to rent collection and eviction https://t.co/Y1vGXhEufP Not much sign of compassionate conservatism here.
Hope so. https://t.co/67b34Hz6Eb
This is very true. Guns are perceived by many of their owners, especially men, as a part of their identity, as a source of self-esteem as they become warrior-protectors of family and society, as icons of manhood at a time when many working class men are otherwise struggling. https://t.co/ZFa5nVJYMU
@iyad_elbaghdadi @ReaderAdrift @n_izzah @anwaribrahim Anwar is also a statesman with a vision in a world that needs both.
@iyad_elbaghdadi @n_izzah If @anwaribrahim is released and leads Malaysia, that's good for the entire world. A grown-up leading a major country.
It's great to see the three American detainees back from North Korea. But did President Trump really have to thank Kim Jong-un for being "really excellent" to them, when he was the one who imprisoned them?
Wow. George Will absolutely flays Mike Pence, as the new "worst person in government" https://t.co/6gi9QuyGxf
@aylajean @sree @perryhewitt @shanesnow @leshinton @jimrosenberg That's what the problem was with my ears! Enjoy @sree's workshop!

Let's also remember the Japanese abducted by North Korea, like Megumi Yokota while walking home from school. We should insist that North Korea account for them. https://t.co/b3hUEEBV0H
Incredible news from Malaysia. The 92-year-old former prime minister has returned to politics and won an upset victory over the corrupt incumbent. Hope this paves way for a revived Malaysia  https://t.co/S4uFqWt1mG

This is fake news about real news. The Times never said that Pompeo was AWOL. It said he was  flying to North Korea and that Europeans were concerned that they could not reach him while the Iran deal was being blown up. If Trump were a reporter, he'd be fired for inaccuracy. https://t.co/5ZPfxFSlPA

Pres Trump proposes taking away journalist credentials. Not sure just what he means, and I doubt he knows either. But at their best, journalists stand up to thugs, warlords and tyrants. In the end, we will write Trump's obituary, not the other way around. #FreePress https://t.co/0Dbr4rDPN1
