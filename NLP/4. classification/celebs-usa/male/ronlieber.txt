@RebeccaTownsend @FAFSA I don't think it's right to say that it did not change any of the requirements when there are now "additional conditions" that apply. Please, the info you provide just has to be clear as day. Lack of clarity is how we got into this mess.

@__BOST__ Hang in there. Save every statement. Print them, or grab screen shots. Record every phone call with FedLoan. Etc.
@austindraws If you pay on time, you build a credit history. The longer that history extends and you pay on time, the more your credit score goes up. At least that's how it's supposed to work...
@austindraws @dealbook I think it can get a credit history started for people who do not have one, so maybe that is a positive.
@joelwinston @RedTapeChron They could not explain it -- or would not. Or could not or would not by my deadline. I should keep at it. I doubt this is the last time it will happen.

My email lines remain open. Clearly, I'm going to be at this for years to come. But it is just so sad that all the good intentions behind the public service loan forgiveness program have ended in such a freaking mess. I'm tired. Send optimism. 6/6
Meanwhile, my mailbag overflows with suffering &amp; occasional success. This week came a note from an Iowa social worker who got forgiveness after a multi-year fight featuring a mere several dozen calls, many formal complaints &amp; a complexifying deferment that he never asked for. 5/6
So was his wrecked credit sabotage? He wondered. In my darker moments, I did too. FedLoan said it was a "timing issue involving an automated adjustment process." Let's hope so, and let's hope it's fixed. But add "wrecked credit" to the list of things to worry about with PSLF. 4/6
Jed was thrilled when his story helped inspire Congress to hand over what was eventually up to $1 billion for a public service loan forgiveness fixit fund, TEPSLF. But he also worried in this 2018 column about whether it might put a target on his back. 3/6 https://t.co/KwfciSJg0u
With a few emails, I was able to get it fixed. FedLoan couldn't bear to have another hit of bad press after what the Education Department's own inspector general did to it last week. Here's my colleague @StacyCowley with the lowdown on that. 2/6 https://t.co/YKVUNKbmcI
There is a sort of bureaucratic violence being committed against our public servants. Remember Jed Shafer? I hoped 3 columns would solve his loan problems. But after he got forgiveness, his servicer wrecked his credit, undeservedly. So here's a fourth. 1/6 https://t.co/y9dpWRL66l

And now I'll go spend another several hours figuring out whether I'm a pass-through before checking to see whether my FSA debit card is still having auto-substantiation challenges and then answering Mom's Medicare donut-hole question that she's spent 15 hours on already. 7/7
So can we please agree on one thing? Any big policy fix that hits us in the pocketbook from here on out ought to make things simpler, not more complicated. A middle school student should be able to read and (write) the federal regs. 6/7
But consider personal finance as it is: An alphabetical avalanche of 401ks, FSAs, FAFSAs, 529s, DCAs, TRAs, 403bs, SEPs, HSAs, IRAs, ESAs, 457s and Cobra (it bites). If you've got enough money to access them all, lucky you. But the sum of them all is confusion and exhaustion. 5/7
Not all simple ideas are instant winners. Free college for all helps people who could afford to pay and perhaps should pay, while Medicare for All would be extremely costly. 4/7
And here is @LamarAlexander specifically calling out complexity in the way that we pay for college. He's got a bunch of ideas -- and real legislative proposals -- for fixing this. Every one would make things simpler. 3/7 https://t.co/ni9coMaCIe

I've seen some critiques/suggestions of critiques of Rent (not #RentLive but the show as written) in the past 24 hours, from @gabydunn &amp; @lostblackboy among others. Is there a good longform take/thread in this vein?
@CarolBlymire Last time I saw it, it did feel like a period piece...
Finally, I thought and think about the Larson family. Sure, we all lost a lot not finding out what he'd do for 50 more years. But my heart goes out to them. I'm so glad they get to at least revel yet again in how much he moved so many of us. His memory is a blessing.
Hamilton came close to moving me in the same way but it was almost too good for live consumption: That one is built for deep, repeated listening, and I still discover new things on like the 100th listen. Rent was more of an instant gut punch. But a great one. (Not a contest tho!)
I remember thinking that I'd never before felt such an incredible range of emotions from any cultural experience: A riot of laughter, intense grief, sympathy, empathy, flashbacks, being tossed in 1,000 directions by the sheer musicianship and hook-fulness of the music.
As we count down to #RentLive I'm thinking about what I was thinking about when I saw it for the first time. What were you thinking about? Here's what I remember:
@pareene I worked there for a year and kept waiting to be invited for some yachting. Once time, there was a party on his floor. (He has his own floor.) Everyone in the building was invited. He didn't come.

@Emma_Marris Aside from extreme reportorial self-discipline, it requires really excellent managers. Great editors are not always great managers. Great managers are sometimes lousy editors. And so it can fall to pieces in a large handful of ways. I've seen it up close, alas. But it can work...

6 days, not 5! #math
Publishing Twitter: Corrections welcome if I've exaggerated or missed stuff, but having lived this myself and seen others go through it, it's not clear why it makes sense to do a preorder campaign with anyone but Amazon.
I don't know how to solve for this. I wish we could work together to figure it out. I contacted your elected president about it once and never heard back again. One place to start? Put business-minded authors on your preorder panels.
Moreover, if you're trying to make the list, you want your preorders rung up in week one when publicity is also hopefully hitting -- really 5 days if you have a Tuesday pub. You can miss those week 1 sales if people have to pick up (and ring up) a preorder in person at an indie.
Here's the problem: Amazon sells a high % of books. And the Amazon algo picks up on early preorders &amp; seems to base last pre-pub warehouse order on momentum. Stuffing their preorder pipeline helps keep em from going out of stock on pub date. Which happens. And boy does it suck.
Hi @ABAbook nice to see you address preorders on a panel &amp; bummed to see it not include authors who are trying to manage a campaign without publisher assistance. (Most authors, as you know.) https://t.co/mAGsTnB6ZG

@BrooklynSpoke @NYC_DOT But there should definitely not be ANY tickets written for church double parking that causes traffic on avenues to bob and weave and screech and brake. No. Way. Ever.

A WSJ editorial we can all agree with: "Jack Bogle was a capitalist for the common man." https://t.co/pkjYVFtacD
Every time I'm back in that spare bedroom in Granada Hills as I was a few weeks ago, I still think about it and brace for another one. I worry too about that long-predicted big one coming to NYC. If it ever happens, I hope I'll be as lucky as I was last time. Good night!
I did not make it to Santa Barbara. We cleaned up as best we could and headed over the hill to LA to sleep at my cousins' house. There, I woke up every 30 minutes or so from aftershocks. A day or two later, I left town. How did they get LAX open so fast? Beats me.
One particularly creepy thing about the aftershocks: The cars bounced up and down a foot or two without actually leaving the ground, as if they were possessed. Shock absorbers -- or whatever it was that was helping them move with the earth -- are really something.
We went outside. There weren't big cracks in the foundation. My uncle went looking for water at one point, but there was a wall of fire across the nearest major street from the downed power lines. He turned back.
The most amazing thing about the family room of the house that night once we got there was that the upright piano had moved several feet from the wall out into the center of the room. That's how powerful this thing was. So would the house survive the aftershocks?
Covering the pillow were large shards of glass from the broken pictures. Had I stayed asleep or not pulled up to a sitting position, my face would have been sliced to ribbons. Would the glass have cut my throat? I don't know. I'm glad I didn't find out.
At some point, I think they threw me a flashlight, or maybe some light came in from the moon. I found clothes and shoes under the pile of books on the floor. My glasses were there somewhere too. Then, I looked where my head had been.
I don't know how long it went on. 20 seconds? 30? It eventually stopped, and my aunt and uncle remembered that I was there for the night. "Ronnie?" they called. "Was that a bad one?" I replied. (I had no idea, literally. Were they all like that?!) "The worst," my Aunt Fran said.
I put a pillow over my head and my head between my legs as I sensed every shelf &amp; picture coming off the walls and flying everywhere. It was dark, but I could tell the standing bookshelves were toppling into the room's center. There was no way to run for the door. I was trapped.
In the middle of the night, I jolted awake to the world basically ending. It's hard to describe if you haven't experienced it, but what I remember most was the sound. It was just so, freaking loud. What were the mechanics of the natural phenomenon that could make that noise??
I was staying at my aunt and uncle's house while reporting my first book, which was about people who had taken gap years and what we all could learn from them. I was supposed to drive to UC Santa Barbara for an interview the next morning.
25 years ago tonight I experienced my first earthquake. It was a big one. The big one. Northridge. And I was just a few miles from the epicenter.

"In addition, we will work with customers who do not have direct deposit or are not receiving an automatic fee reversal on an individual basis to assist them."
From Wells: "We now are planning to automatically reverse monthly service and overdraft/non-sufficient fund fees for a customer who is an employee of an affected federal government agency and whose payroll check was direct deposited into the customer‚Äôs account in November 2018."
BREAKING: Wells decided to improve their offering, 90 minutes or so after this column went up. Fee waivers will be automatic for many now, if it comes to that. Updated text shortly. https://t.co/sdIUjvSkBF

Please no more news alerts for stock market swings of less than 2%. Please put percentage movements in the alert headlines and not contextless hundreds of points hoohah. (Yes, I imagine the NYT is guilty of this too sometimes. Who do I lobby about that anyway?!)

Wow: "In Utah, the independent agency that handles health coverage for state workers is offering to pay for workers to travel to Mexico to fill prescriptions for certain medications that are far cheaper south of the border." https://t.co/LfINduynQ4
@patortman But there's no way to know that it didn't, either, especially from the unknown breaches! Do you think 1 year is sufficient? You make a fair point but I don't think they get let off on "well the data is everywhere so we will be stingy" argument. Especially for something this big.
Here's the truth: Companies that let our data loose offer limited coverage because they can. Because everybody else does it. Because nobody calls them out. Yeah, they feel victimized too. But they have insurance. Would it kill them to protect us for just a little bit longer? END
After all, our dates of birth won't change in a year. Nor will our names in most instances. Passport numbers last a decade generally. All that's still out there on day 366. And yet Marriott's coverage is 1 year. And you know what they said? Nothing. No comment. No answer. Zippo.
Now comes Marriott. I had higher hopes for how they would deal with this, and in fact, their PR operation does run circles around that of Equifax. So all day Friday and yesterday I asked and asked and asked: Why just one year on the Web Watcher coverage? Why not forever?
So we would get a year's coverage. Because, you know, the stolen data just, like, evaporates after a year, right? Poof. No longer usable! (In all seriousness, many thieves put their stolen data on ice until, you guessed it, the year of monitoring/generalized vigilance wears off.)
Somewhere along the way, a decade or so ago, someone thought it would be nice to add credit monitoring when customers' data come loose. Better than getting sued or pummeled in the press, right? We should be grateful! (It's a nice business for Equifax, too. Sigh.
Can I just add a bit more here about how Marriott and other companies handle breaches? THREAD https://t.co/nboc5Oh9HA

@TheFinanceBuff Agreed. So much so that I asked the CFP (F as in Frank) board whether they thought there was some kind of trademark issue with CE (as in Edwin) P. They hadn't considered it before and sort of let it be.
@TimHerrera Blushing and thanks and also raising hand to help people who (like me) could not afford unpaid internships.

@DavidRaeCFP Nope. I had to squint hard to make sure it was not CFP. Deliberate? I asked the CFP board if they had a trademark or other problem with it, and they said no. Seems like there is a not incidental test for the CEP.

@Darla_Mercado Thanks. Had hoped to go there with him but... he said during dinner that he makes money "from the profits of the insurance company." Artful. No mention of dreaded C word, let alone that it's likely 6% plus.
@buffoalaton But we do not need a fiduciary rule fer shur
@kramericancap Wait til you see the food-related followup I have planned. Look for it in a few months.
@adamtirapelle Thanks. We went back and forth on how far down the compensation road to go and left it out for space. Glad you pointed this out.
@matthague1 @kramericancap I hear you. I think you could argue that there are people who are fearful of losses &amp; yet know they need to at least try to beat inflation (there may be guaranteed minimum) via some "safe" market exposure that will probably not be negative over 10 yrs &amp; then... you end up here.
@EricTorbenson @RetireMeASAP Thanks, yeah, we went back and forth about how far to go with the product itself and compensation given the desire not to scare readers off given the already long length and... I'll come back to it.
@kramericancap Aha, that's how it works?!
@kramericancap No. Sigh.

An update. After I inquired with Marriott HQ about our readers' confusion, they've added some language to the Kroll page to make it clear that Kroll owns Web Watcher. Hopefully the will fix their first/landing page today too. https://t.co/eEdOjqwZS3
@LaurenZHaynes Not a good one alas
I'm reasonably sure that WebWatcher is better than nothing, but Marriott should offer it for life, not for one year. And, of course, you should have a credit freeze. Do you? If not, now would be a good time. They're free now. END https://t.co/onw7JacYxs
Then, off you go to a Kroll branded page -- not the WebWatcher service you've been promised. Worry not, Kroll owns WebWatcher it seems. Fill out the form. Once you've signed up, then you'll get some WebWatcher branding.
On the middle right of that landing page, click the box next to "I believe I am affected by the Starwood Reservation Database security incident." Then click "Enroll Now."
Start by clicking the name of your country (this only works for US, UK and Canada alas) at the bottom of the first page. It will then look like you've been sent in a circle back to the page you started at, but some new info will appear over on the middle right. Look at it.
First of all, they don't tell you that the site they are sending you to has Kroll's name in the url. Don't worry about this. Go there anyway.

@feeonlyplanner Just guessing but given that this is Starwood only, I wonder if it happened during merger integration. So many vendors and systems changes.

@patagonia @LLBean These pants did not live in the back seat, though I'll admit to maybe never having washed them. Was that the issue here?
@patagonia Thanks so much. Was not aware of the washing thing. Could it be a pure age thing too? Also, does all waterproof everything have an interior "lining/coating" like this that can cause this to happen? Or if I spend more, can I avoid this?
@LLBean (&amp; @patagonia too -- this has happened with your jackets): Why does the inside of my rain pants disintegrate in rain like this? And when is waterproof really, truly waterproof?

@RichBGoldberg We just got the email announcing the armed guard.
@dansinker I needed that laugh today.
@nahgemishere @adambonin True, and sometimes they are outside, during services, especially on the high holidays. It is not clear whether that was the case today, or whether the officers who were shot were first responders who did not arrive until several minutes after the shooting began.
@mravitch My head hurts. But we may have to talk about it. Will there come a point where your shul insurance premiums quadruple if you lack armed guards?
There at least some US synagogues that have armed guards. Seems more in Europe do. No idea what we'll do at our temple. And for Trump to bring it up here, as if it's somehow their fault for not having armed guards -- that that should be normal... https://t.co/mIIQkQXp0d
@bossymaggoo Thanks, yes, I know it goes on for HH. Curious whether some do it all the time now -- ie whether people really believe/do what Trump just said.

@anya1anya @FreshDirect I don't use the public platform here to seek anything for myself personally, lest people think I'm using the NYT affiliation inappropriately. But going public generally might help this from happening to all next year (in Jerusalem...). One can hope. And pray! Have an easy fast...

@JustinSoffer @OpenTable Serious question for @OpenTable: Who would choose not to collect points? Was there a clamor of survey responses saying "No more points!" If there was, did it happen after you made the points so hard to redeem?
@JustinSoffer @OpenTable Damn. @stephanielieber mentioned this too. You have to click a button every time? When did this start? I got points without clicking 4 weeks ago. They might as well kill the program at this point, no?

@erinarvedlund Some Raj Chetty data that was reproduced in a slide in someone's presentation.
@IraStoll Age 35 I believe, compared with top earner among two parents if both were working. Touche on expenses, of which there are likely much more now. But I haven't seen good research on that.
@amyzipkin I think Raj Chetty et al will keep tracking it if they have ongoing access to IRS data (gulp, note political climate...), which has been rare in the past.
One of the things I am tracking in "What to Pay for College" is how much this chart scares parents and impacts their choices. Does it scare you? Or not matter at all? (We are kicking it around right now at #AIRForum2018) https://t.co/chwrotvWNa

@stevelonn @lpblake1 I kind of hate income as a metric in this conversation, at least for my readers. But it's one of the "best" (ie highest volume of data, even absent non borrowers) or arguably only good universally comparable data on outcomes. Please make more data!
@stevelonn @lpblake1 Fair enough. I want a big set for my readers, not a small set. But that can't compete with (or replace) visits, conversation, research -- especially given that this is one of the biggest checks that any of us will ever write. But more good data would help a lot.
@stevelonn @lpblake1 100% agree It is one of many things people care about and think they are paying for (or at least should be thinking/caring about), not merely the one thing. But it's not unimportant either.
@stevelonn And what do we have that applicant families would absolutely love to see...
@stevelonn @lpblake1 OK, so who does it best? Or just spends the most time trying to figure it out? This is one of the great mysteries of my reporting for "What to Pay for College." Applicant families want data on how much smarter kids will get, however schools want to define it, quant/qual/whatever.
From @lpblake1 at #airforum2018: What does it mean to work on a team as a student? I can't just send out a survey, like "How's that team going? Disagree? Strongly disagree?! (Room cracks up.) We'd like it better if you could just see it in action, but we're trying to measure it.
Ok one of the best parts of #airforum2018 so far was definitely the crowd reaction when US News college rankings guru @Bob_Morse got up to ask a question.
@tapsdo I'm curious about the applicants though -- if I'm being asked to pony up $300,000 if I get in and matriculate, how much access ought I to have to your data - all of it - before I agree to come and pay that much?
@tapsdo Different but related question that is at the center of my research: What should be made available to applicant families? What should those famiies feel entitled to, in fact?
@stevelonn That's a great point, thanks, had forgotten that everyone is everyone else's social science thesis experiment.

Dear higher ed twitter (and #airforum2018): True or False: Undergraduates are wildly over-surveyed and thus have survey fatigue.
Hi #airforum2018 one thing that is fascinating here is how many times I've heard about college faculty being defensive when institutional research does survey/assessment work. Many of these folks have jobs for life, so what accounts for these feelings about your work? Seems odd.

@RFrailich New America has written a lot about it... maybe start here but there are other posts/papers. https://t.co/AwDKRkvAvK
@RFrailich No change to the student loan program has ever been done retroactively. So presumably any cap/cut/kill is for all new loans after date of implementation of new rule.
@RFrailich The $350m is for folks in the wrong repayment plan unwittingly/due to bad advice. If he's been doing it right all along, then he will not tap the $350 million.
@RFrailich It is just so bad. Even scarier: Of the 500k or so folks who had filled out an ECF about half had ZERO qualifying payments as of 2016. In the 24-month cohort after the 139 crew there are under 2,000 people. Literally nobody knew about this thing or was doing it right for 5 years.

@cblesz Go back and read my writing on government pensions. You literally have no idea what you're talking about. I wish we could have sane conversations about important issues. It bums me out. Instead, you throw around insults and false assumptions in public.
@cblesz I'm glad you do. You deserve more credit for doing so -- and a tax break that amounts to a larger number of dollars per socioeconomic demographic than what wealthier people get who would save the same amount anyway.
@cblesz @nytimes A number of times -- thanks for noticing! Because those are the people who derive the majority of the benefits. If we're going to extend the use of this tax break at a time of increasing deficits, we should consider doing so for the people who need the help the most.
@cblesz @nytimes Also, look at what you've just written there. If you're using the tax break, you're relying on the government. No shame in that, by the way - no sin in responding to useful incentives. Way to go on that front! But you might want to consider not tossing that around as a trope.
@cblesz @nytimes And you come in with your biases about the NYTimes and who I am. Read it again and think about the implications. If we capped tax break/use for the wealthy, then middle class/early savers could have *more* benefit. The distribution of the benefits here is disproportionate.

@jasongay @WSJPR I want an answer. I share because I love the stories, and I think others who love the stories would share more often if they could know for sure when their followers/friends would hit the paywall. You and me kicking it around over email doesn't solve the larger confusion.
Hi @WSJPR please create a guide to sharing your stories via social? It is never clear on FB especially whether my followers will be able to read what I share. And is it still always paywall-free if I email using your tool? This makes it more confusing: https://t.co/znMn2zwjwR

@JetBlue 325. Please have JFK ops ask GAs why they boarded so early w no warning. We just wanna know what to expect. (On that note, would it kill the pilots to tell us where we are in the takeoff queue each flight? A little info goes a long way.)
@JetBlue Also, the door is still open and it's now been nearly... 15 minutes since the last person boarded! Funny how that works sometimes, JFK/PA/ATC/FAA and all.
@JetBlue Nope. Flight boarded 15 mins early. I just want truth-in-boarding-passes, you know? I like getting out ontime/early too, but just have the boarding pass say what you intend to do so I don't have to toss things in bag &amp; make a run for it to have my bags within 15 rows of bulkhead.
@JetBlue Should we all just assume that boarding may happen 15 minutes before the time listed on the boarding pass at/on any random moment/flight? And without any notice being pushed to the app/boarding pass? Very @AmericanAir of you! And makes it hard to play bag derby.

@morganhousel @jasonzweigwsj That's what I'd say if I was them. But many investors have a brand preference that transcends a basis point or two savings. I might too, almost on principle: "We should invest with the company that made low prices possible in the first place, not the reluctant follower."

@TomAuchterlonie I totally missed the video but agree that at-home care could indeed save a ton in many instances and create a lot more happiness at end of life. Also plus-oneing offing all the cats and mice.
@JonBoeckenstedt Yeah, even so, with all the noise about massive state cutbacks and their need to refill the coffers with Long Island and Winnetka money, I would have thought that it would be bigger.
@TomAuchterlonie Ah, yes, good for overall system efficiency and simplicity and fairness. Now that you mention it, I do know of one effort that I may write about in 6 weeks or so. Stay tuned...
@TomAuchterlonie Pricey. But I think what we all miss is that many people default to treating Medicaid like a LTC entitlement. Almost 2/3 of people in nursing homes are ALREADY using Medicaid to pay at least some of the bill. It's been stealth creep on that stat for some time...
@JonBoeckenstedt Probably would have guessed more UC schools higher, but that trend may have started even earlier? Or perhaps it's just that the out of staters are divided among so many UC campuses.

@swdea7 Meanwhile Twitter bombast and shaming does nothing for civil discourse. I am easy to find if you want to pick up the conversation via email. I bet we have more in common than you think.
@swdea7 Does it not make sense to consider limiting the tax break to the very lower &amp; middle income people you cite who could use it most - maybe even giving them a bigger one? We know what happened w 529s. It will be worse here.

@Rich_Hershman Hi @NY529Direct. I plan on taking $5 out on 1/2/18 and sending it to my kid's private school. You gonna come after me?
@Rich_Hershman Or parents can put money from 529 in their bank account (allowable in NY albeit by defying notice on w/d form), write a check to private school and let the state and the feds fight it out! I'm gonna do this just to see what happens. Stay tuned. lieber @ nytimes dot com for more.
@Rich_Hershman It's messy. Those states are going to be under the most pressure on the income tax side &amp; their residents may try to make up for some of their "losses" on income tax side by piling into new 529s. Would the states then take away that break, thus doubly screwing folks? @529Source
@Rich_Hershman Or will they just suck it up and change any statutes/regs that are now in conflict?
@Rich_Hershman Or would they try to segregate funds in accounts (two for each beneficiary) and only release $$ that has gotten deduction on way in from the "college" account? Would they really bother to operationalize that? Or would it just be easier to kill the deduction/credit? (Gulp.)
@Rich_Hershman Thanks going to be interesting to watch. How would this happen in practice? They can't refuse to release $$ for K-12, can they? Or would they pick a fight and sue?

@steveniweiss I think you can be 100% sure it will be usable but some people will wanna wait to withdraw until there is clear guidance. But we already know how the rules work -- they'll work same way they do for 529 w/d for college.
@hinesalmy Can't see. Let me guess, higher prices?!
@steveniweiss No guidance yet, but I have to think that if you pull money that is there 1/1 and use it for private school on 1/2 that whatever rules arrive in March will cover what you did.

@Amerika_second @RichardRubinDC @JesseDrucker Oh, I've got it -- all those people who live on a boat and sail around the world homeschooling. YOU CAN USE THE 529 FOR THE FREAKING YACHT. Sailing/engineering of the boat is part of the "curriculum," right? So it is a "material."
So @tarasbernard and I are trying to get every last bit of consumer-facing tax bill info (including rumored/attempted changes that did not happen) into one plain-spoken article. We're about 90% there with this: https://t.co/34wy3JKunm
@staceyNYCDC @thegarance Indeed thanks. They need to read my story. Will they be able to extract $30k in savings in no-longer-paid capital gains taxes the way the 1% will? Or deposit 200k at birth? They'd get more benefit if this was income-capped.
@Amerika_second @RichardRubinDC @JesseDrucker I bet someone will try. Doubt you could pay for plane tickets but a tutor in Rome for sure. "(1) curriculum and  curricular materials; (4) tuition for tutoring or educational classes  outside of the home (but  only if the tutor or  instructor is not related to the  student);"
@chasewillsey @indie_tx True. But 1% will almost certainly get soooooo much more. I hope you get a lot too though...
@harryh @Noahpinion Read the story -- 30k per family is totally possible.
@Fdr1942 @Noahpinion I would indeed like to see the code giving a bigger tax break to those who can least afford to save. Could have lived with the tax break being capped at 10k if those savings went to people who need tax breaks more.
@harryh @Noahpinion Exactly. Lots of tweets from middle class folks and again, the shorter period the money grows the less in cap gains in theory. Wealthy w big deposits at birth will likely get most benefit here, esp if they wait until mid/high school for w/d.
@chasewillsey @indie_tx Thanks. But at the expense of college savings? More tax benefit comes from letting money run longer. (Or maybe your kids are not going to college?) I still believe that 1% will get vast majority of $$ benefit &amp; that you/mclass would have had bigger one if this had an income cap.
@ChippingClapham @nytimes We are in heated agreement. If the point (your point!) is for people who never get a break to get a break, we can give them a *bigger* break by limiting breaks for those at the top of the income stream. Then there is *more* $$ left for breaks for people who never get a break.
@ChippingClapham @nytimes I resemble that remark! But I just don't think that making this unlimited/without cap reflects the purported/stated big idea behind the plan. It should phase out somehow, somewhere...
@ChippingClapham @nytimes Agreed again! But capping it at say 250k for couple filing jointly would keep this from being a plaything for the 1%.
@ChippingClapham @nytimes Agreed. But if point is to help middle class or help them most, then this break should have an income cap so the benefits go where we theoretically want them to go. Without the cap, the benefits will almost certainly go disproportionately to the 1%, which wasn't the larger goal.
@indie_tx Which is why mostly the folks with LOTS of money will likely be able to take advantage -- ie who can save enough for both K-12 and college. Or maybe some will use it for kids who are not going to college.
@ktart6 @nytimes If grandparents gift tho, it can work..,
@ktart6 @nytimes Would you have been able to save enough w 4 kids to get and wait for capital gains large enough that this would have saved you real money tho? Most middle class folks could not - this is mostly a break for the patient, esp if your state has no 529 tax break.
@RichardRubinDC @JesseDrucker Maybe - there is that mysterious use of the word "public" in this section. I had wondered what loophole it might open.
@pbenter No that stays the same.
@RichardRubinDC @JesseDrucker For homeschoolers? There is a list in there. For general K-12 computers might be looped in as they are for college. Prolly room and board for Andover too come to think of it..

@barbarasoderlin oh, i see -- you think people will contribute more to 529s now thus leading to lost revenue for states? interesting. hadn't thot of that. we'll see.
@barbarasoderlin Not that I know of - some states do have capital gains taxes but not clear whether they may try to tax capital gains from 529s taken out for private K-12 school or whether they could.
@TomAuchterlonie But aren't many new condos (no J51) in NYC sky-high on taxes, much more so than houses of same value in city? That's my recollection.
@TomAuchterlonie Interesting read. Property taxes vary wildly in city I find -- some condo people paying a ton while some brownstone people paying much less. Have never understood it, seems based on age of property or something.
This is actually happening folks. Didn't think it would. No income caps. With some goodies thrown in for the homeschooling crowd. https://t.co/s3O5OZSb7F

@TheOriginal44_ @lynn_spruill If this is indeed a middle class tax plan, we could just say that you can't use 529s for private school unless you have under, say, 150k in income (and everyone can still use for college, as before). Lots of caps elsewhere in code for various breaks. Could do it here too.
@TheOriginal44_ @lynn_spruill I think the most appropriate question is this: If we're going to give tax breaks and only have so many to give, should we give ones where it is very likely that most of them will accrue to the most affluent among us?
@TheOriginal44_ @lynn_spruill Only if they can save enough -- and long enough --for the foregone capital gains to add up to anything. Seems like a lot to shoot for if they are also saving for retirement and college and are truly middle class.

@LFremdenheim @TheOnion @HuffPost @BuzzFeed We will get that about 20 years after the rest of the world, the way things always work, right?
People like @LizBowmanEPA have been trying all year to keep us from doing our jobs. They're failing. @EricLiptonNYT https://t.co/iVNrwU1jSM
@nickgieschen @Experian_US I'm willing to bet that they won't respond here either. I hope I'm wrong.
@jdruotolo Yes!!

@RichardConniff Loved your NYT oped. And I'm willing to bet that my pals at @rjjulia would send you books. And I know @Powells would.
@nathwice @CUNY @Hunter_College You are right. Thanks for pointing it out. I should have paid more attention to what we chose here.

@ALTSadvisor @MichaelKitces Interesting. How do you define subsidized -- any tax incentive? Which ones that touch consumers are utterly unsubsidized/lacking distortion?

@katerh24 @DanielGershburg nobody.

@MRansom324 @lizweston @Equifax Call 866.349.5191 -- this is supposedly the place where they can get you the PIN.
@TJR In olden times, this was how it was done. Now you can do it by automated phone line or online. In theory.
@andrewkueneman Never. Yay America!
@JosefBlumenfeld @jodikantor Can you get to back to school night for us tonight? We are having trouble.
@DanielGershburg At some point they have to care. If only Amex and Chase would call them and say "We can't process applications, wtaf?!"
Still waiting for a response from Equifax on this. Here's hoping nobody's mortgage is shut down. https://t.co/a4j83HDPVn

@straighttalk44 Can't be true. Freeze but not alert.
@bjstef So many people have suggested this, and I hate that I am starting to believe it. I've asked.
@ID_Theft_Lawyer My experience has always been that protection &gt; hassle by a long way, but now that Equifax's systems are melting I'm wavering.

@St_George_of_Va Yup.
@St_George_of_Va Ah yes, the one that announces "Security Freeze" in the return spot, so mail thieves know that your PIN is inside? That one?
Nearly 2.5 hrs since I first queried Equifax (after it said last week this wasn't a real problem) and... silence. https://t.co/a4j83HDPVn
Yup, snail mail. Isn't good for them either or car dealers or mortgage lenders. The company is fundamentally broken. https://t.co/giRoK7LODX
You've told me for days that you can't lift Equifax freeze by phone or online. Same true for me. Speechless. Am demanding a response now.

Hey you guys -- Equifax's website appears to be... WORKING! (And yes, you have to do all 3 freezes separately.) https://t.co/Vj6iBhEyWN
@amazingdancing Great to hear! You're lucky. They will not inform other two (that is only for fraud alerts). You gotta freeze the other two separately.
