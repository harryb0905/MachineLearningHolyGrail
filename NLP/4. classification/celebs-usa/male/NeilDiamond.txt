Thank you Brian! ‚Äú@BrianWilsonLive: I listened to @NeilDiamond 's new album this week and it blew me away. Check it out - ‚Äù
.@lesearcher it's me.
Thanks for all the great questions. I'm going to watch the World Series now. Good night all, tweet ya later! https://t.co/3yuqcWcZtz
.@strestan Sleep-in, have breakfast, New York Times, see my grandkids.
@samswinnerton not really.
.@OnlyTheAwesome All the time. I just figure if I want a good one, I write it myself.
.@Archiecrat I like biographies / autobiographies.
.@calindy59 I sure did. Hope you're feeling better.
.@judecloversaid Thank you. My wife tells me that all the time.
.@agentcesd Melody and Bluebelle
.@rustykup Is she talking about twerking? Try #mileycyrus
.@emP332  Not weird. Sounds right to me.
.@Denise8462 Hi!
.@ThatDamJonGuy In-ears were recommended to me by Sir Tom Jones and Cliff Richard. I think they saved my voice bc I no longer have to shout.
.@NeilGnR  Tried it at my last show at the Greek Theater in 2012.
.@MasterCylinder0  It's a calling, not a job. He'll know when to put it away or keep going.
.@shauna9800 The glass beaded stage shirts are a thing of the past but I've saved them all.
.@Ramen8uout I remind myself, "It's rock &amp; roll, it's not brain surgery. No one will die if I mess up." That keeps things in perspective.
.@Ohpompeo I Am, I Said.  At least that one took the longest.
.@SuperiorDanW Right on, Gabe!
.@MAMentoring OK.
.@jbaldini The legal pad is a necessity for me, I can write, crossout and change faster than a computer and doesn't require electricity.
.@saramctweets Is that a thing? I think I love it! I hope I get invited.
.@zoegillespie My designer Margi Kent makes them.
.@watchnut33 Will definitely try! That's one of my favorites to sing.
.@CouchPotatoCop The parachute jump on the boardwalk at Coney Island (even though it's not operating)
.@LadyZales Depends on who's serving it up.
.@CssCbs Not gonna lie... I get some weird stuff.
.@NeilGnR What's brown and sticky?   A stick!!
.@kenminersr Jimmy and Seongah are my brother and sister-in-law.  Jimmy is my wife (Katie's) brother and their story is true.
.@PhillyCatMom02 Jacknife Lee, co-producer on the new album gave me a neon sign that says it and it hung the studio during the recording.
.@wrigley6 Good question. Not doing anything different.
.@MichaelSalamone All the time.
.@Johnmarc I don't know exactly why, I think it's all about the songs.
.@PapaBear7652 Nobody can restrain Jack Black. The man is a force of nature.
.@rwmckenna It was about 35 years ago, I don't exactly remember how but I'm glad it happened.
.@JS_Foundation They were rescue pups from the shelter. My wife and I adopted two of them and the rest have all been adopted!
.@londonjustin I thought it was hilarious. I love Will Ferrell.
.@kade6767 It's been a long time but I'm going to try it this Friday in NYC at Barnes and Noble on 5th Ave. Is this a question a plant?
.@Clife2014 My favorite song on the new album is "Seongah and Jimmy".
.@odapup She loves them all (at least that's what she tells me.)
.@sgejim No I haven't, but I'm dying to try it.
.@brenskin2 Thank you so much, it's already one of my favorites.
.@annaOkayy Duh! I'm forever in bluejeans!
.@felcraw Sadly, Clampy the scallop is gone. *burp*  My dogs love to celebrate Halloween.
.@Archiecrat My mother thought I would be a comedian because I could always make her laugh, but music won out. Thank goodness.
.@thirty3anda3rd Hi Brittany.  I'm most nostalgic for the 50's when the Dodgers were still in Brooklyn.
.@cmcc09 The tour will have both classics and new songs from Melody Road. Any suggestions?
.@Archiecrat Call a professional!
.@toddinwichita My team didn't make it in so I'm just cheering for a good, competitive series.
.@anditrocks UB40s "Red, Red Wine" and Sinatra's "Sweet Caroline" are two of my favorites
.@AmbuLance the recording took about 4 months and I connect with every song on this album.
.@sws1965 Maybe someday, right now I tell my stories in songs.
.@dcmcdonough I go to the quietest, least distracting place I can find to write music.
