@sharonmatt20194 yes but i guess i was referring more to conservatives from all parties  Just as progressive ideas have been supported by various parties at various times. Like Republican anti-slavery at the time of Lincoln.
i assume the. you’ve felt that way about past claims, such as Obama’s birth certificate &amp; clinton foundation rumors, etc ? https://t.co/x8oQJsAQxR

#PresidentReagan had been a 2 term gov of calif. tons of experience. i voted 4 him. i was happy about some things but ultimately realized that trickle down economics had been lousy 4 the mid-class and others even tho my own tax bill went down. we all lost as economy fizzled https://t.co/zYv29zvbZX
bad idea! motion picture directors are required to be some form of a dictator. some are benign and kind, some are harsh and unreasonable but none are not trained to work through a democratic system to get things done. Corp CEOs might have the same problems  what do i think! https://t.co/Pks3sNinsg

I’m glad there was an apology. However, If @RonPaul has an aid who thinks it appeals to constituents to publish a bigoted cartoon it suggests something I find repugnant and divisive within @RonPaul ‘s office. https://t.co/klpifpwni6
Shameful @RonPaul &amp; for Americans of Irish, Italian, Jewish, German or E.European descent who agree even a little with in this cartoon, know that just decades back those faces would have looked like your ancestors who suffered from the age-old propaganda of bigotry &amp; bullshit. https://t.co/IVbAvrtz8X

I’m obviously all for celebs voicing opinions &amp; supporting candidates &amp; causes...it’s when they are invited to speak at a political convention that I wince. It’s not supposed to be pop entertainment - it’s a representation of what policies the party supports and leaders’ vision https://t.co/NCSLZ4ZdF1
Religious leaders certainly have the right to voice opinions, of course!  It’s when they are included by a party in a political convention that I feel it’s inappropriate. It suggests a holy war of sorts. BTW, not happy about celebs making speeches at the big conventions either https://t.co/8cloXHRDKX
@b00haha I hear you. Many thanks for the compliment!

Going to the press, especially after resigning, is entirely appropriate in my mind. There is likely no one in the administration who would act on his concern, given its nature. That’s an important reason why we have freedom of the press and free speech. https://t.co/SXcMtm8OeS
Me...I guess   Actually, my father in law used to call my wife Cheryl “daughter” now that I think of it. I guess I got it from him :-) https://t.co/f3e5aNtvw7
It’s an accusation worth reporting and exploring given the subject has been a dutiful servant who says he resigned over the pressure to lie to fraudulently attack an elected official...wouldn’t you agree. If you heard this about Obama, wouldn’t you want it explored further? https://t.co/lzBGR4xV9H
It’s the requested lie from his superiors that bothers me most. What do you think of this request to lie to fraudulently attack an elected office holder because they oppose POTUS ‘ position?  Inexcusable from any party in power wouldn’t you agree? https://t.co/poCy1eEMea
Yeah - this guy looks to me like he is telling the truth, too. https://t.co/skr5RP7vgG

I’m not saying I personally view post ww2 period as our greatest. I’m projecting that maga supporters look to period of economic dominance as the thing they are nostalgic for. Personally, I don’t look back.  I look ahead. Let’s get better! https://t.co/TSpBDzzXNS
I always assume that, too. A time when most other economies were in a shattered state, so our dominance was clear and there was little global market competition. Taxes were high (90% top bracket) so there was infrastructure money to work with and the war economy continued. https://t.co/EIWGJo80Nc
Honest question to #MAGA minders. When was America at its greatest? Can you tell me an era that reflects the “Again” that you hope we return to?
