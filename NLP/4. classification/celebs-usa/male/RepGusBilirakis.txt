I was proud to help secure $100,000 in federal funding for Pasco County Schools' School Based Health Center.  The funds will be used to improve the physical and mental health of students and families in Holiday. When kids' primary needs are met, they are better able to learn.
This week’s ruling in federal court regarding Blue Water Navy Veterans is an important step forward, as it recognizes it was never the intent of Congress to exclude these Veterans.  The VA shouldn't prolong the suffering of these heroes by appealing. https://t.co/FDcSFkpUwK

@Maria61187273 Thank YOU for your advocacy and passion for such a great cause!  Keep up the great work.  Together we will make a difference.
ICYMI- I am grateful for the Superintendent and Board's input, which helps me know where to direct my efforts as we work to ensure that all children are kept safe at school. https://t.co/m6QEBUTs6S
ICYMI- I recently joined a bi-partisan group of lawmakers to introduce legislation that expands Veterans’ access to community health centers, which provide comprehensive health care services (including primary care, dental and mental health).   https://t.co/cxprSkj83j
Today, I was honored to meet with my good friends from Hillsborough Community College.  They do a wonderful job preparing students for meeting the demands of our local workforce, and I look forward to working with them and continuing to support that mission. https://t.co/ntbrfYKlLI
It was an honor to be invited to speak to our future leaders at Westlake Christian School in Palm Harbor this morning.  These bright young children had a terrific grasp of their civic responsibility.  It is obvious their teachers and parents are doing a great job! https://t.co/eqG6bCjcCx
ICYMI- I was proud to have 2 important bills to help seniors and one bill to preserve high quality healthcare for over 25 million Americans signed into law last week.  https://t.co/QPbDddNihb
My initiative to permanently eliminate the annual limit on per patient therapy expenditures in Medicare became law.  Previously services such as physical, occupational or speech therapy were capped at $2,010 per year.  I delivered on my promise to fight for seniors.
This morning, bi-partisan language I sponsored to crack down on fraud in Medicare and Medicaid became law
The VA has finally awarded the contract to expand and renovate patient care areas of James A. Haley Veteran Hospital, which marks the culmination of my seven year battle to secure state-of-the-art, private rooms for Veterans in Pasco and Hillsborough. https://t.co/V1mrU0pbB2
Due to media stories, just wanted to confirm that myself and the GOP conference are traveling on a train that has been involved in an accident. While I am fine, some people have sustained injuries. First responders are on scene and I am praying for everyone’s quick recovery.
Congratulations to Dr. Rao Musunuru, a tireless public servant, generous philanthropist and longtime advocate for post secondary education on his recent reappointment to the Board of Directors for Pasco Hernando State College.
It was great to speak at the National Federation for the Blind’s annual conference last night about legislative initiatives to ensure visually impaired Americans are able to fully participate in all aspects of society. https://t.co/Rf87EwIUUh
Here is another great story about how the pro-growth economic policies we passed as part of the new tax law are already helping American workers.  Despite the naysayers, its hard to argue with results!   https://t.co/NuxvP3y6VE
ICYMI- My colleagues and I remain united and vigilant in the fight to protect Florida's environment and economy. Click below to read the joint letter from a bipartisan group of Florida's delegation members.  https://t.co/jLLn2pslvO
ICYMI- I'm proud to help my constituents impacted by flooding. https://t.co/FWgySEq2Yd
I think its unconscionable that Members of Congress still receive their regular pay checks during a government shut down. This weekend, I sent a letter to the Chief House Administrative Officer directing him to withhold my pay until normal government operations resume.
ICYMI-https://t.co/E41Ta4rHDz
I am proud to have helped secure millions of federal dollars to fix flooding problems in Pasco County.  These funds will help improve the lives of my constituents. https://t.co/Dqeyg1zZpi
Florida has 374,884 children who stand to lose their health insurance if the Senate votes to shut down the government today. I hope my colleagues will do the right thing. This drama is senseless and unnecessary!
The bill provides essential funding for the continuation, and extension for 6 years, of health care for 9 million low income children through CHIP, ensures the availability of affordable flood ins. through the NFIP and staves off the job-killing medical manufacturing device tax.
The American people expect us to work together, to put the needs of our country above petty partisanship and above all else—to govern.  While I don’t love the use of Continuing Resolutions—I certainly prefer Regular Order- it is the unfortunate position we are in.
I introduced  SIT-REP Act, to protect Veterans using GI bill from any penalties that their school may impose due to potential delays in the processing of their tuition payments.
The American people expect us to work together, to put the needs of our country above petty partisanship and above all else—to govern.  I have confidence that my colleagues in the Senate will do the right thing for our children, our troops and our country.

I met with Dr. Pat Arola, the VA Undersecretary, to discuss my pending legislation to expand dental services for Veterans.  I shared my vision and my well-researched opinion that providing preventative dental care lowers the cost of treating chronic medical conditions.
ICYMI- I am fighting on behalf of Veterans exposed to toxins in burn pits during their service.  They can’t afford to wait for medical treatment and benefits.   https://t.co/FoA6DEmqx7
I'm glad the Administration listened to the voices of Floridians and will not be drilling off the coast of Florida; however, we must ensure safety standards remain in place.  https://t.co/MVk0POlviM

Today, I secured my first legislative victory of the year with passage of my SAFE TECH bill out of the House.  This bill will improve the safety of air travel. https://t.co/ijFwNM6Fx6
Heroism is the unfaltering desire to serve others. There are those among us that answer the call to protect and serve our community each and every day;  and their continued willingness to put themselves in harm’s way to ensure public safety is nothing short of heroic.  Thank you! https://t.co/d8ibFNO7za

It is nice to see a factual article about the work we are doing to ensure health care for children.  This issue is too important to be the subject of partisanship and misinformation.     https://t.co/q5G1nbqeYr
Because our hard working teachers spend so much of their own money to provide daily necessities for their students,  I coauthored a letter to the members of the Tax Reform Conference Committee asking that they not only preserve, but expand the teacher supply deduction.
@ermizmo1 I'm continuing to work on this.  It is a high priority to me.  While I'll push in Congress, I also believe that the VA can do this immediately, based upon court rulings.  I've sent a letter asking the Sec. to do it.
This week, I was pleased the House passed a bill I co-sponsored, H. Res. 407, which condemns the persecutions of Christians around the globe. As we celebrate International Human Rights month, we must be sure that the fundamental human right to worship freely is protected. https://t.co/kBkXwdSXGs

Erdogan’s renewed inflammatory rhetoric and lack of respect for long-standing international agreements causes serious concern and does nothing to advance regional interests, much less provide for stability and prosperity.  We must remain steadfast in our support of Greece.

Funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is too important to be used as a political bargaining tool. I urge my Senate colleagues to move forward this week by passing the House-approved bill to continue funding of this vital program.  https://t.co/1WoZhpTngv

Establishing a drug management program in Medicare will prevent at-risk beneficiaries from abusing controlled substances. #Cures2015
#Cures2015 would provide NIH grants, encouraging young scientists to pursue new medical discoveries.
#Cures2015 will help ~1.5 million Parkinson’s disease patients by creating a national data collection system for neurological diseases.
My legislation in #Cures2015 will force the FDA to finish overdue guidance on combination products - products with a drug and a device.
#Cures2015 establishes a structure to qualify new biomarkers to help accelerate approval for new drugs and treatments.
.@HouseCommerce included the “Innovation Fund” in #Cures2015 to invest in more resources for the discovery of new drugs and cures.
Greater clarity in the use of FDA’s Accelerated Approval will hasten treatments and cures for patients. #Cures2015
#Cures2015 increases funding $1.75 billion a year for NIH – all fully offset.
Modernizing clinical trials produces better, faster, and cheaper results for cures. #Cures2015 #ECCures
My OPEN ACT in @ECcures will incentivize companies to “repurpose” major market drugs for rare diseases and pediatric cancers. #Cures2015
