@cjane87 @ElasticHeron hoping to count this as my free writing exercise for today
@cjane87 “DEBATE ME,” he yells into the void of a starless night. Shattered watches and torn calendars litter the nearby grass.   A piece of paper, held aloft, folded and stuck through with a pencil, catches the wind and trembles.  “...debate me.”
@McFaul @jonivy Hey, I get what you’re saying- but to put it so is undignified.
https://t.co/YqjKjzTKEy
I just realized the first part of my tweet is kind of confusing. I didn’t mean that I want baby Charlie to say “that’s mere child’s play” about me winning the Olympics.   I just want him to say it about anything. Because he’s a baby. And I think it would be hilarious.
Today, success is defined by how soon I’ll be able to get my son to say, “Ha! That’s mere child’s play.” No luck so far.  Crazy, how time works. I’m really grateful that people were able to enjoy such a special moment along with us. Happy 5 year anniversary! https://t.co/lYJq6f1KhE

@fritzswanson We really only evolved to create a society which would allow wealth inequality to breed such bored billionaires that someone would bring back the dinosaurs the end. What a strange Rube Goldberg machine reality this sim is turning out to be.

@ianbremmer That a question could be asked with literal intent but understood only ironically is a problem of language
@ianbremmer This seems more like a kind of critique on the subtle ways language can break down language and fail to serve the reality it is used to define, rather than our current political situation
@jared_sed Finish it and report back
@ejnsofi Wow this might be the saddest response. I’m sorry that was a thing!
@Secretoriginz Maybe it will be assigned to unprepared highschoolers one day!
@PamelaChelin I wasn’t emotionally prepared to read the wiki plot synopsis just now
I’m not sure I was emotionally prepared to read “Flowers for Algernon” in high school. And the fact that I’m thinking about that right now for no specific reason basically cements it as truth.  Comment with books you were not prepared for

In the end it’s revealed that all efforts to halt proactive measures in the battle to reverse climate change have been directed by the same cold/flu companies seeking to capitalize on what will be an explosion in new strains of cold/flu with the rising global temperatures https://t.co/deZRpGbcH9
Our unwitting protagonist/dashing antihero dives into the seedy cold/flu pharmaceutical underworld to find they won’t allow airport general stores to sell face masks which would (too) effectively deter the spread of contagious airborne pathogens and thus cut into their profits
It’s really important to me that you read this whole article.  After you’ve finished, I think you will understand how a tweet or the headline simply cannot capture the absurdity that this administration represents as student safety and educational progress. https://t.co/2UGVPDxRbv
@AmyAndrewsFOX2 Yeah sir-up. But I’m not sure if I’ve just decided to say it like that, or I’ve always said it like that.   There’s a bit of a grimace that accompanies the “seer” in seer-up that makes me feel self-consciously midwestern. Lol...

@KristiMac2014 @rockerskating Pretty sure Patrick could have advertised that his choreography was done via consulting a ouija board and he still would have gotten good scores because his skating is just so good. Choreographer rep makes little difference.
@KristiMac2014 @rockerskating Mostly because it’s just really good music. The music itself just needs choreography to match its highlights, and boom, it’s effective. The story, or maturity, really only enters in with dance, I’d say.

Couples who have joint Facebook/Twitter/Instagram: How’s that going?   Do you use plural pronoun when communicating?   Are your posts really...a synthesis? Is it just not worth the time for 2 accounts when only one of you is committed to maintaining social media relationships?

@AccurateImpress Yes, he’s not the first president to do those things, thus he didn’t set the practice in motion. He’s part of the curve and continued it in his own way.
@AccurateImpress I don’t think you understand the initial tweet you to which responded
Diversity *is* a strength. Interacting with people you specifically have little in common with will give you practical insight into what it is to be human, and how to best exist in the world we share. We’re lucky to have differences and we’re lucky to be able to celebrate then.
Getting ready to film a @ClassroomChamps video on the importance of diversity, and this pops up. Sad to see the mental gymnastics people will go through to try to explain why it’s ok for them to feel comfortable with racism and xenophobia.

@Jennichu75 I mean yeah that’s why I tweeted it. There’s no room to maneuver this concept in a way that isn’t changing the argument to be about something else.
@Jennichu75 Why do the consequences have to be equal to show that it’s pretty hypocritical to hold the idea of anti-consequence over peoples’ heads?
@Jennichu75 My implication is that they’re both anti consequence
@Jennichu75 What’s the comparison?
@dittmar_melissa Oh ok

@nys1emt If you’re gonna say “same thing”, you should make it an actual comparison. So - could you refuse service or fire employees who had all worked at some point as the WH press secretary under Obama and had been caught in lie after lie to the american public? For sure you could!
(Sexual preference in this case)
Because that’s the implication of your tweet. Refusing service is a right most establishments keep. *Discriminating* against someone because of the color of their skin, their religious beliefs or sexual orientation is not the same thing.
Let’s say you own a shop. Outside stands a known liberal, who also happens to insult every person that walks by. If you refuse them service because they were being a terrible person right outside your door-is that the same thing as refusing a black person *because* they’re black?
Really? I think refusing service from someone because they consistently lie to the american public in a government job that requires honesty is very different from discriminating against someone because of their sexual orientation. https://t.co/QIcg3gxeIm
@peko3417 @albedobell @NumbersMuncher @Jakeweindling @PressSec Which means that you’d be fine with the reversal of political affiliations in this story. But because liberals are all thin-skinned, they can’t handle it?
@peko3417 @albedobell @NumbersMuncher @Jakeweindling @PressSec You don’t think it was innapropriate because the left conditioned society to allow this kind of behavior? Or it’s not innapropriate in a vacuum? I’m getting mixed messages.
@peko3417 @albedobell @NumbersMuncher @Jakeweindling @PressSec So, and tell me if I’m reading this wrong, it is the liberals fault that she acted inappropriately.
@allahpundit The “if I ignore it it’s not my problem” approach!   Convincing yourself “it’s not so bad” to own the libs!  Brave stuff
@albedobell @NumbersMuncher @Jakeweindling @PressSec So you’re saying you agree with me, but you want to make sure people blame liberals for her action?
@NumbersMuncher @Jakeweindling @PressSec What does anyone really “owe” anyone else? Ethical behavior isn’t much related to that thought process...

@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie You can be concerned about whatever you want, but you’ve said multiple things that simply aren’t true. You’re doing a disservice to your cause by undermining it with demonstrably false statements. You can’t make a legit point with fear mongering hypotheticals and call it a day.
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie Probably the fact that it hasn’t? I guess you can fear monger on the hypothetical, but it’s better to look at what’s really happening before you villainize illegal immigrants for something there’s no actual proof they’re guilty of.
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie That means you have at worst, potentially over 200 *individual* issues of voting fraud- a far cry from anything resembling even the potential for mass illegal immigrant voter fraud. And if was *easy* to commit, it would be easy to find more than a &lt; .1% effect on voting
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie  https://t.co/NtjsUbXXfn
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie Which counties are over inflated? What’s the margin of error there? Why are illegal immigrants necessarily be to blame for mistakes made by other groups of people?
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie It’s very easy? Where’s the study of how easy it is? Is there some tangible proof that it’s easy?

@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie Well you didn’t say *every*, you said *any*... https://t.co/uFIFLIVJBQ
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie “Historically poor record keepers” and “every illegal immigrant with a license is able to vote” are wildly different takes. One is unverifiable but potentially true, the other is undeniably false.
@courtneynhicks @etherealtb @ashtonbirdie Honestly it just takes 2 seconds to fact check https://t.co/Jql1ccl4Lq
@courtneynhicks @ashtonbirdie So you’re assuming it’s illegal immigrants rather than any other potential cause based on what?
@courtneynhicks @ashtonbirdie So you’re saying that even though there are separate processes for citizens and non-citizens to receive drivers licenses, they’re ignored? Or...? Just not sure where your getting this info from? https://t.co/1JqxEuFRpI
@ashtonbirdie You don’t get a ss# when you get a license...

@philipaklein @allahpundit I think the disconnect is that we’re not all coming up with arguments for better school safety. If the arguments are flawed, what’s the better solution? Why is preserving the life of students not seen as a higher priority than mocking their attempts to make radical changes?

@AmberSt83247855 Do you get paid per nonsense talking point? What’s that fee structure like?
@MaryRatzlaff1 @AutumnA17336504 It’s a shame online discourse has devolved, for sure. Like I said, should be fun explaining to my son how the POTUS, the most powerful man on the planet, was the worst offender.
@MaryRatzlaff1 @AutumnA17336504 I don’t know what you’re talking about.

@lucky4dog @AutumnA17336504 Oh for sure it’s a bot- but they’re talking points, when forced into the open, can only serve to unite and inspire. Their efforts should be less than futile.
Get your ignorant racism out of here. I’m actually sorry for you that you feel the need to put yourself above others to justify your own misconceived significance in the world, but it’s really just garbage. The less people think like you, the better off we’ll all be. https://t.co/4XuJzy5Teu

Online communication is actually impossible because everything is either  1) referencing some other internet thing that you’ve never heard of, or   2) it’s an intentionally ironic statement so far past the point of making sense that it wasn’t worth reading in the first place.
@lucialiljegren @walterolson So the school recognizes the necessity for its students to be present in order for them to be properly tested on their knowledge?
@lucialiljegren @walterolson So aren’t you being a smart teacher by making sure your students are understanding the material by giving them the test on a day they’re actually present?
@lucialiljegren @walterolson Isn’t the point of being a teacher to  make sure your students learn the material of your class?
@walterolson @davidharsanyi So, just like everything else a student does in school?

@dianakander cc: @TheDemocrats
@annmjensen The weight of the tiers and the discrepancy of the scores and the tiers I think worked out correctly for deciding who should be sent to the Olympics. And I say that with a lot of love in my heart for Ross, and what he accomplished at nationals.
@annmjensen And means different things to different people, probably even in the same committee, even when using a system set forth to be as fair as possible. Ultimately it’s true Ross had almost no chance compared to the others in contention based on his body of work.
@annmjensen So the next best thing inherently leaves it in the hands of people and their best method for weighting competitions over a period of time. This leads to issues in itself, and what a skater earns over two years vs what a skater earns in one night is very subjective.
@annmjensen Of course a written in stone mathematical formula would be best. But it’s hard to do that because what if your clear top skater has to miss nationals but would be fine for the Olympics. A 0.00 for a heavily weighted Nationals would take them out of contention.
@annmjensen I think you’re being vague to be polite. Better to be honest here. That way I can tell you what I know.
@annmjensen I’m not sure you can look at any man made system or organization which has achieved anything of note, and not see things which are unethical and disappointing. The world around us is teeming with man made horror, and yet we’re still living in the best time in human history.
@annmjensen I can definitely sympathize. But having said that, the selection process still does takes into account multiple performances. Still about actions.
@annmjensen I’m not sure what you’re referencing

I encourage others to share what positive lessons they take away from the Olympics. Let’s actually use it as a time of unity.   Here’s another one of mine: During the Olympics, you see clearer than ever that action is what defines a person, not their words.
The Olympic Games will be here soon, and wow does it feel like we need a refresher course on the importance of what the Olympics represent.   First- When the world comes together under the banner of integrity and perseverance, we see that personal success derives from unity. https://t.co/JpV9Wmu2yN

@lindsayschoon Words have power, and we need to be smart about how we use them. I want skating to be a place where strong opinions can be shared without trying to bring our interlocutors integrity into question as a way to make our “side” seem more favorable.
@lindsayschoon Questioning my integrity by saying I’m going to bat for Ashley’s PCS “because we’re friends” rather than that just actually being my opinion isn’t a good look.

Instead of proportional cuts, why not follow through on the promises that got these people elected and make a concerted effort to help the struggling middle and working class *more* than the rich?
@mikebuono6 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I think people are upset that the tax reform promised during campaigns to help the middle and working class disproportionately aids corporations and the wealthy. No one’s forcing you to be upset, but it’s not unreasonable that this be so unpopular. https://t.co/PuEl5MAJ1Q

@nreal_pro @CHSommers Is sexist and ignorant, not science.
@nreal_pro @CHSommers Everything is connected, yes. And since equality is a relatively new concept, it makes sense that it would take a concerted effort to make it possible. Making generalizations about the potential of a sex based on a combination of potential biology and the effects of society-
@nreal_pro @CHSommers Exactly, the amount which is biological and the amount which is from societal pressure isn’t measurable. You can’t say “accept that women can’t measure up biologically until society actually gives them a chance to do so.” That’s my opinion.
@nreal_pro @CHSommers Yo reread the thing. What he’s pointing out as generalized differences are not necessarily biological in nature, nor does he tout them as biological- but rather the causes of societal pressure and a culture which sets the mold which women deal with.
@nreal_pro @CHSommers Haha yeah to use as an excuse to discriminate... Kinda PC of you to purposefully misconstrue the point he was making, just to make it more palatable and your position more defensible. Own being a jerk if that’s your thing. Don’t give in.

@ComfortablySmug But he’s actually retiring. If he said   “I am *not* retiring, because what I’ve done doesn’t compare to the allegations against [insert Republican sexual predator here]. That’s the real crisis we should be dealing with right now.”   Well then you’d have a case.
Hahaha this is the best headline. Thanks to @IngrahamAngle and Fox News for proving it’s possible to *actually* be the devil’s advocate. https://t.co/YMCblqfcE9

@senatorshoshana It’s not hope, we demand perfection no matter how unreasonable that is, because thats how we fulfill part of our job as citizens to help our country improve. No one will ever be perfect, but they need to know we’re holding them accountable for even well intentioned mistakes.
@senatorshoshana Yeah you’re right.   These are the complicated ethical quandaries where we need our thoughtful leaders to do a better job in leading the way. He’s making a selfishly ethical correct choice... hahaha, life
@senatorshoshana Roger, as far as Ben is concerned- Isn’t the lesser of two evils is a thing worth fighting for? Esp when a lot of what we’re dealing with right now is the more devastating of two evils. Isn’t it negligent to pretend inaction is anything other than theoretically correct?
@senatorshoshana It’s a liberal position to vote for the opponent of a child molester?

@andevers Faux outrage is probably best way to prove you’re in the right.
@andevers @JohnnyGWeir Things are totally out of control, but is now the time to embrace sexism? I just don’t think so.
@andevers @JohnnyGWeir Yeah it’s super frickin weird, I agree!
@andevers I said *a* question, not *that* question. But you knew that.
@andevers @JohnnyGWeir Friday*
@andevers @JohnnyGWeir I’m skating with him tomorrow in NYC, come watch! I didn’t think I was grilling you, just asked 1 question...
@andevers Really edgy way to communicate. Most people just don’t respond if they don’t want to answer a question .
@andevers And what do you mean by that?
@andevers That’s an unusual response
@andevers @ryanbeckwith Why would that happen?
@Demboyz1960 @sberrios5171 There are also pretty separate levels of undignified behavior, the measure of which must be taken into account when leveling criticism. Some presidents make it obviously easier than others.

@GarrettHaake @kasie @lisamurkowski What’s that? The sound of goodwill being thrown away?
@theboone29 @SSideRebuild Yeah just be yourself, but then don’t be mad when people don’t like the person you are because the real you lacks dignity.   Seems hypocritical to expect people to act like they like you if you can say whatever you want, don’t you think?
@ComfortablySmug It’s exhausting that no one 100% agrees with my every gut instinct built on the minutiae of 30 years of RNG based personal experiences.
@AlexNBCNews @BresPolitico Obviously, right?   How is this not the most obvious thing?
@kmo_anywhere Haha, hypothetically, of course
Hypothetical-   If you have a president that brazenly supports anti-American ideologies, how could you in good conscience support him as leader of this country?
Trump continuing to drag our reputation through the mud.  Skating with the GOP because he’s presiding over the economy Obama built.  And Dems, while still the *only* alternative, seem like they’d rather not get their act together. https://t.co/q8Ttvfahxs

@brianstelter I miss the days where this is a more notable story...

@ella_soes Just because it’s aimed at one particular person means it isn’t offensive to the entire race? How does that make sense? Because you say so?
@ella_soes @CNN_News_Source @brithume @AbeSausageKing @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I mean... obviously yes.
@ella_soes @CNN_News_Source @brithume @AbeSausageKing @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Always good to be able to ignore racist quirks in the people you agree with ideologically

@KevinNR Just as the Creator intended us to treat one another...
@jpodhoretz If “lecturing” is three tweets and stats on the political leanings of scientists then you’re proving his point.

@DiamondCassi Ok... even if that were the case. Twitter is not my workplace- It’s a social media app.
@DiamondCassi Are you saying everyone should fear  being fired from their jobs for speaking their mind politically?
@DiamondCassi I’m sorry you feel people who have had success in their respective fields shouldn’t be allowed to express themselves as concerned citizens.
@DiamondCassi You don’t want people you disagree with to voice their opinions? That doesn’t seem like a healthy perspective.
@DiamondCassi Sorry, I️ don’t totally understand. The act of telling someone to thank you, and hoping they’ll thank you because you helped them, represent the same thing to you?
@DiamondCassi Do you think expecting to be thanked and vocalizing those expectations are different?
@SlackerAtWerk @tracyskate @realDonaldTrump What has he cleaned up?
@YourboyJacoby It’s not even my job to explain why you’re wrong, and yet here I️ am. Is it too little to ask that you thank me for taking the time and effort out of my day to do so? Or does it feel a bit patronizing?
@YourboyJacoby How can you will something if you don’t understand it?? I think most people would agree it’s necessary for parents to contextualize societal norms and explain their importance to children.
@YourboyJacoby Can’t believe his approval rating is so low since this is the best way to defend the job he’s doing.
@YourboyJacoby “Make America great again by demanding thanks for doing our job.” “Make America great again with unnecessary and petulant tweets.”

@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Think critically people. Consider that you could obviously misinterpret something she said because you *want* her to be wrong.
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Her husband ran against Hillary in the 2008 primary! Of course she's not for voting for a gender simply because you're also that gender.
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Michelle was asserting that Hillary more than Donald is concerned with "the voice" of women. Again. Obviously.
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe This is so dumb. Their own voice is represented by the candidate who works towards their ends, it's not because she's a woman.
@realdetective I can read the room

@LahavHarkov @karol I'm sure you've heard her speak before, she's obviously thoughtful in her rhetoric.
@LahavHarkov @karol Obama ran against Hillary in 2008 primary. How stupid and hypocritical would she be to at this point to say vote for women if you're a woman
@LahavHarkov @karol Not that because Clinton is a women you have to support her or you're betraying your gender. Michelle is a lot smarter than to assert that.
@LahavHarkov @karol It's in the context of the choices-how her voice compares to the other candidate. She's argues Clinton moreso than Trump advocates for women
@karol @LahavHarkov Do you understand context? She didn't mean *because* she's a woman. But ignorant hot takes can sound good if you're into that kind of thing.

@nustud2007 @FoxNews @WattersWorld So when I point out a divisive tweet from fox, your best effort in seeking resolution is to say "actually it's the left"?
@nustud2007 @FoxNews @WattersWorld So every time you point out when something is wrong you clarify that there are other parties making similar mistakes?
@nustud2007 @FoxNews @WattersWorld And you didn't condemn both sides either... have you just disagreed with yourself? Or is fox and all conservative media blame free?

@BruceTillotson @FoxNews @WattersWorld Drinking what koolaid?
@FoxNews @WattersWorld Ridiculous fear mongering. Stop dividing us.

@BrandonDillon75 I think we need a better response than this, Brandon.
@neontaster Your tweets are great. I don't agree often, but am very grateful for your thoughtfulness and consistency.
Since we must stand such ignorance for now, let us at least create a teaching moment for our impressionable children from it.

@Chase Thank you @Chase
@HLM915 Yeah that's what I said, just in a way that makes you more comfortable with it. Which... that's fine with me. You do you
@Brycejanderson @Tracinski @iowahawkblog @Tracinski Aren't you over-enforcing political correctness to say this is anything other than a (poor) joke?
@HLM915 @warrendad @caitlinzemma @politico So your final take away is that it's best to become a hypocrite because the people you disagree with are hypocrites?
@kmanguward @KatTimpf This is straightforward and seems newsworthy now as a contrast to actions of others in the administration, as opposed to a snarky hit job.
@HLM915 @warrendad @caitlinzemma @politico So because liberals are hypocrites you're not upset with Tom Price misusing tax payer dollars? You see why that doesn't make sense, right?
@iowahawkblog @Tracinski Where are liberals defending Kim Jong-Un?

@HLM915 @warrendad @caitlinzemma @politico So because you feel like the previous admin was wasteful, you've just now decided current wastefulness is not a big deal to you anymore?
@HLM915 @warrendad @caitlinzemma @politico Which is why you must find this pretty unethical https://t.co/V1UoPfUZkr
@HLM915 @caitlinzemma @politico It's the contrast to those in the admin wasting taxpayer dollars for travel that makes this noteworthy at all. Thus the low bar.

@JonahNRO @SethAMandel Yeah, everyone's a lot better off for this impeccably timed rebuttal of his work in the White House. Way to pick your battles, guys.

@4yankeedoodle @FoxNews @DLoesch Yes... that's exactly the point of a museum. Why fight to keep a monument to people who fought for slavery and hate in a public park?

@BluePopcan Normally I would totally agree with you, I just think Trump's past getting the benefit of the doubt on social issues.
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster Anything is possible, but that's a distinction I think you make if you care about the difference.
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster He said there were "very fine people on both sides"
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster I think both, actually
@Noremacam @BluePopcan @neontaster Yeah, that's why I said "implied"
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster Uh, the one who implies there are good nazis?
@ElectaWing @neontaster @SunBro100 @BluePopcan What happened to you when you learned about it?
@ditzkoff Wowwwwww
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster A politician stating the expectation that all political actors decry nazism isn't a political maneuver. It's a categorical imperative.
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster Stating your beliefs to be in line with the basic expectations of representing civil society cannot be construed as "opportunistic".
@BluePopcan @Noremacam @neontaster So it's politically opportunistic to not brag about sexually assaulting women too?
@neontaster @SunBro100 @BluePopcan What? Intl political gambits meant to insure safety for Americans can't reasonably be used as a barometer for nazi hate...
@Noremacam @BluePopcan @neontaster Political opportunism of being against nazis. How is it opportunistic if everyone sans Trump is in the same page?
@Noremacam @BluePopcan @neontaster How would it be more influential? What form does that take?
@BluePopcan @neontaster What's your takeaway? The past administration isn't allowed to justify their hate for nazis? What??
@neontaster Is there a point to this besides trying to make the people who hated the Obama administration feel a bit better about themselves for trump?
@statedeptspox So, I didn't think we had to ask, but: what's our stance on Nazis and racist groups around the world? You still condemn them, right?
@seabisquick Thanks Vicki! We're in it together.
@PopSci How many of us can you take up for real though?
@bmorris16 @realDonaldTrump The Presidents have, for all of recent history, taken a strong stand against white supremacists and neo-nazis-Why should Trump be different?
@realDonaldTrump "The bad people" are the ones who expect the President to make timely and appropriately damning responses to Nazi's killing innocents?
@MichiganDems @BrandonDillon75 Where can we look for hope if not in the efforts of those that would lead us out of these dark times? Let's go guys
@MichiganDems https://t.co/CfEAll8Lzb
@kwatkins205 You honestly think that by saying don't hit them, I support Nazis? What is wrong with you?
@kwatkins205 No, not even close- but I am saying you as a citizen act against the best interests of the country to use physical violence against Nazis.
@embeedub @OhNoSheTwitnt Is this what helping looks like?
@kwatkins205 So you're saying we're at war with a foreign power? Or you're saying the rules of civilization don't apply to your moral authority?
@chosenhorse2 That's arguable. But I never said we shouldn't have entered WW II, I'm saying we're not in WW II. There are no enemy combatants.
This isn't time to cosplay WWII. Killing people is the very thing we're looking to work against. You don't prove it wrong by calling for it.
We're not at war with a foreign power, we're in an ideological war with hate mongers. It's not justice to seek their deaths, it's harmful. https://t.co/YsCtnU9pU2
@jultz4norris If supporting violence when it's never going to change the root causes of hatred is what gets you feeling proud, rethink the point of it all
@jultz4norris Why do you suppose white supremacists are the way they are? Because they haven't been threatened with physical harm enough?
@jultz4norris Walking away from college with a degree is not the definition of educated. Obviously.
@jultz4norris Uh, I never said America shouldn't have fought German nazis in WW II. Don't put words in my mouth or make generalizations based on my race.
@jultz4norris So again, you think leave everything the way it is, and violence will be the ultimate solution? Yes, education is the answer.
@jultz4norris The fact that you would just rather punch someone than consider how your time could be spent thinking about better ways says a lot about you
@jultz4norris Yeah remember how we defeated German Nazis in WW II? It wasn't with hugs. We killed them. Millions. They're still around.
@jultz4norris Education and policy can enrich the lives of Americans through diversity. Or we leave everything the way it is and hope punching is enough?
@jultz4norris Consequences come in the form of how society reacts to their hatred. Do we work to create an atmosphere where ignorance is stamped out?
@jultz4norris How did you come to the conclusion that pepper spray is the appropriate harm?How is causing them physical harm making a positive difference?
@jultz4norris So... you recommend killing them? That's the antithesis of justice.
If you think violence is a legitimate answer to any of the issues our country faces, *your* legacy becomes one of ignorance and violence.
@FaithBased92 @FDRLST and abhor people who would incite violence using liberal ideaology as an excuse. Because I believe it to be antithetical.
@FaithBased92 @FDRLST Violence is not the answer. I would consider that an aspect of my liberal idealogy-
@FaithBased92 @FDRLST What are the elements on the left that are the same as neo-nazis?
@FaithBased92 @FDRLST No argument there
@FaithBased92 @FDRLST People that feel when there are people showing anti American hate, there be Americans brave enough to literally stand up to it. "Tribalism"

@JebandCorey @CathrynLopezRE @ses01 @joelpollak Oh yeah, sorry, you stopped making sense a while ago. I decided to let you sort through it alone. 👋
@CathrynLopezRE No one deserves to have the people they looked up to turn out to be frauds. Sorry that happened. Go Blue!
@JebandCorey @CathrynLopezRE @ses01 @joelpollak Doesn't seem like a traditionally manly thing to do.
@JebandCorey @CathrynLopezRE @ses01 @joelpollak You're saying your definition of a real man is one who serves in the marines? Does that also include "insults random women online?"
@JebandCorey @CathrynLopezRE @ses01 @joelpollak Your retort is another insult? Adults acting like children doesn't make me feel great, unsurprisingly.
@JebandCorey @CathrynLopezRE @ses01 @joelpollak You disagree with her beliefs but attack her personally. What a brave and righteous thing to do. Your parents teach you to act like that?
@ses01 @CathrynLopezRE @joelpollak Where's the botch?
@joelpollak You cater to base emotions and feed ignorance with glee. Good luck looking back on your "work" without any nagging doubts. It may haunt you.
@joelpollak What abuse would that be, exactly?Expecting a higher standard from our elected officials? Standing against fear mongering?Sorry that offends
@CathrynLopezRE @joelpollak He's sold himself to a movement that makes him feel important. His intellectual dishonesty allows for an unfortunately skewed moral compass.
@asher_lamar_wu @neontaster That doesn't make any sense. I figured to see that written out my intent was obvious. Not to be taken at face value.
@asher_lamar_wu @neontaster That's my pointing out how logically flawed the argument is in the first place. Racism led to PC which is the cause of racism?
@asher_lamar_wu @neontaster And is useless in actually gaining any understanding of how we arrived at this juncture if you act like there is no other historical context
@asher_lamar_wu @neontaster In which he says the detrimental effects of PC culture have lead to an explosion of radicalized racism, which is *at best* hyperbolic -
@khannaford @neontaster "The suppression of others beliefs" is unique to political correctness? Is that your final answer?
@mtracey @fredbauerblog And also sanctioned the crap out of Russia, and was vocally assertive in his stance on the issues he felt Russia needed to clean up.
@mtracey @fredbauerblog And then Putin became reckless, and Obama changed his treatment of him.
@mtracey @fredbauerblog That Trump doesn't makes him an obvious outlier. The factors that make a president an outlier is probably narrative worthy, don't you think?
@mtracey @fredbauerblog There's been ample cause in the last 2 years which would have reasonably led any past American president to vocally criticize Putin.
@jwoodin @neontaster Yeah it makes me sick that dems are constantly fighting for equality- well, when they're not busy keeping millions of Americans insured.
@mtracey @fredbauerblog How is that odd? Why would anyone expect that should get "the narrative treatment". It's already a norm of US foreign policy.
@asher_lamar_wu @neontaster I'm arguing it's not the obvious and simplistic societal process that he's presenting it as. The larger historical context *is* relevant.
A modern and civilized society has every right to be surprised when people embrace racism. Regardless of what ridiculous excuses they use. https://t.co/cn8aa5UL0J
@neontaster The deep-seeded racism that has been a part of our country since it started is to blame for XtremePC, which is in turn to blame for racism.
@neontaster We should empathize with racists who are radicalized by PC culture, but not those who feel everything should be PC because of what led to PC
@neontaster Right I'm asking you to identify what societal process led us to having a PC culture, and asking why that doesn't also deserve blame?
@neontaster What of the societal process that led us to a place where political correctness reigns? Just keep passing the buck down the line, right?
@neontaster Yeah don't blame the people throwing up nazi salutes. Blame society for telling them they're not allowed to.
@LauraLoomer @Mike84759412 Journalists don't create the narrative for the person they're interviewing. You literally told him to say he peacefully pushed that girl.

@senatorshoshana If he can go through the trouble of verification, then RT away. If that's an unreasonable ask, then don't bother. That would be my position.
@senatorshoshana We should expect that the President show the awareness to avoid the traps the world lays by those which do not have good intentions.
@senatorshoshana I don't see why anyone should care what it takes to bring credibility. If you can't assure it, don't do it.
@senatorshoshana He has a wealth of options at his fingertips to make smart decisions. He *chooses* not to.
@senatorshoshana Being the president *is* hard, every single aspect of it. So I don't feel bad holding the president to a higher standard.
@senatorshoshana I don't think due diligence is asking too much for the most powerful man on earth.
@senatorshoshana The president shouldn be expected to be cautionary and thoughtful with wth every message he sends. Whether on twitter or elsewhere.
@senatorshoshana The issue of credibility is something he constantly hammers on, and so when he proves he lacks it, his hypocrisy is damaging to the office
@senatorshoshana He's the President. I would say, respectfully, everything he does is a big deal. His ignorance on display is an especially big deal.
@senatorshoshana Serious question- Is his appeal a greater mystery than that of the Kardashians?

@lissainthezone @KatTimpf Wait- do you honestly think these very real and serious issues are the fault of our current senators?
@keri_1973 @KatTimpf @SenStabenow Seems like you're purposely avoiding answering my question.
@keri_1973 @KatTimpf What're your biggest issues with @SenStabenow ? I think she's done a wonderful job of helping Michigan.
@Acosta @RichLowry Calling yourself news is too self congratulatory, apparently.

Anyone watching this GONG SHOW masquerading as "working government" will never forgive nor forget the GOP betraying the citizens of the USA.
@Jamielee644 @JYSexton @cbeilinson 50 plus Pence
@chrislhayes @BenSasse Not hard to swing a gavel between some feel-good-small-town-extra-earnest tweeting. Well as long as millions lose their insurance in the end
@JYSexton @cbeilinson This is brutal
.@SenatorEnzi seemingly more concerned with his "satisfaction" than in giving out any information on a bill no one knows anything about.
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @Scaramucci @BarackObama The only skill that Scaramucci has shown on the job is his ability to agree with the President. Being crude doesn't = independently minded.
@anamariecox He said he's sorry (for helping put the finishing touches on the total destruction of our gov's credibility). Do we have to pile on? (Yes)
@BenSasse Sometimes you need to show how normal you are. Sometimes you need to work without comment until American lives are no longer in jeopardy.
Hate and discrimination reveal both weakness in ignorance, and power of the self-evident truth of one's right to be master of their identity https://t.co/rvI67v21xj
What kind of person would I be to not speak against injustice and the destruction of our country's ethical foundation?   I love the USA. https://t.co/fSgTqFB3gl
@TopherSpiro @BenSasse Gosh... unfortunately his hands are tied by his cowardice
@FDRLST @georgi_boorman the fact that you never consider the artistic implications of making a change to an artistic medium makes this simplistic
@morninggloria @AngryBlackLady Cc @danharmon
@mjohnston1512 Honestly, I wish I'd saved them
@McAllisterDen @Jhic709365 Why would anyone care? This is America. *Especially* those that would fight and die for you deserve the freedom to be themselves.
@McAllisterDen @Jhic709365 But I guess if you're looking for a reason to discriminate, you can still use money as the excuse
@McAllisterDen @Jhic709365 https://t.co/GgzrxaT8bj
@govincentzhou Well said
@joelpollak Unmatched rhetorical skills.  "Changing the subject is a really effective way to avoid talking about that subject"
@senatorshoshana @Tracinski How about let's be less stupid in real life, where real people's lives are affected by it? Since both are impossible, why not aim higher?
@clareswares Why do you think that?
@MatterGloria @AliBradleyTV @RealJamesWoods That's quite a rude thing to say. Would you say you feel empowered to be rude because of the way James Woods here acts?
@Sherry20680 @AliBradleyTV @RealJamesWoods @KatTimpf And also yes of course I love kittens.
@Sherry20680 @AliBradleyTV @RealJamesWoods @KatTimpf Not every conversation has to have a premise which is sure to be agreed upon for the people interacting to be agreeable and decent.
@patsphotos Which is what's really stupid, in my opinion.
@patsphotos Not just when it's hard, but especially when it's hard. Otherwise we're shooting ourselves in the foot and thinking we're better for it.
@patsphotos I know we're different and that makes it hard, but 95% of the people want this all to work out for the best. And for it, we have to be nice
@patsphotos One where you don't take potshots at other people because they're different from you. Like the tweet I'm responding to.
@AliBradleyTV @RealJamesWoods @KatTimpf True. &amp; Those of us with influence should use said influence to help create an atmosphere that can breed opportunities for actual dialogue.
@AliBradleyTV @RealJamesWoods @KatTimpf 👋 Asking the always tough and seemingly unanswerable question- Do we have to promote divisive rhetoric simply because we're different?
@ScienceNews I was just arguing about this with a friend. Glad it's settled.
@RealJamesWoods James, why do you care? Just to find something to insult people over?
Some positivity goes a long way. https://t.co/Uoxhpbwsms
@neontaster @grailsnail I think he means hypocrisy and hyperbole have masters on both ends of the spectrum. People only tend to point out everyone else's.
Thank goodness for Topher.  Thread https://t.co/nO0wXNEo7K
@juliamacfarlane Just because people are briefing him doesn't mean he's can be considered briefed. That would require a moment of focus and dedication.
@jonlovett @jpodhoretz You don't have to explain yourself to someone who's built his portrayal of a person on being glib and, more notably here, a huge hypocrite.
@MariManoogian It's not like the state dept is able to function anyway.
@ZekeJMiller I'm [now sure] this guy is undercover trolling the whole Trump administration
@ZekeJMiller @maggieNYT I'm honestly starting to believe this guy is undercover trolling the whole Trump administration
@SilverScarCat @neontaster No worries. I'm sorry we all have to deal with intentional ignorance because it does change us.
@SilverScarCat @neontaster You're supporting my argument, and also defining the slope we're referring to.
@gooseycheeks @neontaster Than you've cemented my initial point that Obama's policies were not the impetus for the slope which has given us Trump and his policies.
@SilverScarCat @neontaster Ok. How does this relate to what I said?
@acebb20 @neontaster Maybe pay attention to the conversations you're getting into before regurgitating what seems like the right thing to say.
@acebb20 @neontaster Notice I never said he was. I said he didn't get the ball rolling. The idea that this is his fault or he created this is my issue.
@acebb20 @neontaster But wait, there's more!  https://t.co/UvQzs9pFWn
One's actions, not their inner turmoil, define them. https://t.co/csmuhwl1wS
@JonahNRO  Nietzsche's herd morality as the highway to nihilism. So many relevant issues. https://t.co/YAEchKp4nY
@gooseycheeks @neontaster Which as I highlighted in the article you're using as your proof, explains that there was a shift under the Bush administration.
@gooseycheeks @neontaster You don't understand what a slope represents in terms of actions taken. An action, while the first of its kind, is related to the precedent.
@gooseycheeks @neontaster Yes the idea that Obama was an instigating force for a new slope vs a point on a slope that's already begun.
@gooseycheeks @neontaster This is from the article you're using to convince me... https://t.co/DsViLNpXCZ
@neontaster Things began to change...   We're still arguing what started the trends here right? Not that Obama was or wasn't perfect. https://t.co/Y7s7CCjJT2
@neontaster Obama did not set in motion targeting the media or expanding executive powers. He's just on the slope. Disingenuous to blame him.
@alweaver22 @Tracinski @hughhewitt Such clear and concise messaging...
@thehill Probably because he may have had to answer some actual questions.
@maggieNYT Does Trump even know?
@neontaster What precedents do you feel Obama set which have led to this?
@rjblaskiewicz @ditzkoff America wants its soul back, Bob. So I'm afraid we need to just get in line.
@city_food_prof @BrendanNyhan Good catch
@ditzkoff What's gonna happen to healthcare when 50% of the country has to be treated for stomach ulcers simultaneously? https://t.co/jwvD0ke1Nb
@JonahNRO Probably not, because I'm agreeing with you
@realDonaldTrump Here's your chance to set the record straight.   Or you can just keep acting like truth is the least of your concerns.
@matthewhoendorf @JonahNRO I agree with him, and what you're trying to complain about is the underlying point in the section I left in.
@JonahNRO  https://t.co/p8hISUihH3
@PopSci I did not see that coming
@WTheGroomer @BraddJaffy Not everything is fodder for you to complain about what could be. We're dealing with what is. Join us here in reality.
@WTheGroomer @BraddJaffy Really brave stand you're taking here. Trying to defend this behavior is morally reprehensible. Sometimes a terrible thing is just that.
@kernals12 @BraddJaffy The POTUS abusing his station to indoctrinate impressionable children? Yes that is worse in my book.
@jaroot99 @chrislhayes @BenSasse @SenSasse Noted
You know that burning anger that fills every breath and the world turns red?  Our children deserve better than this. https://t.co/HJ7FXaiDrd
@jaroot99 @chrislhayes @BenSasse @SenSasse Just because something is true doesn't mean it needs to be celebrated... He's a wasted talent
@BraddJaffy This is the most repulsive thing he's done. How dare he talk like this to children. Unbelievable.
@chrislhayes @BenSasse I take no pleasure is saying that @BenSasse is a hypocrite and coward.
In case you've been ignoring the necessity of this for over a month, it's never too late to be a good citizen! 👇 https://t.co/OKC5vZr1sZ
@21doublej @MadVoterInMN Here's an actual article that actually explains things. Enjoy. https://t.co/5joZk3XtjG
@MadVoterInMN @KidRock @SenStabenow That's so shortsighted and cliché-  I'm not sure you understand the implications of what you're asserting here.
@MadVoterInMN Oh ok, your proof is context free quotes chosen piecemeal to push a conspiracy theory. Roger that.
@MadVoterInMN @KidRock @SenStabenow What's your proof that it was designed to collapse the insurance market?
@MadVoterInMN @KidRock @SenStabenow And FYI insurers are leaving the markets because the GOP undermined and sabotaged the ACA.   https://t.co/emfvXsEWav
@MadVoterInMN @KidRock @SenStabenow That's an odd answer to my question... almost as if it's not an answer at all. Just saying things doesn't make them true.
@MadVoterInMN @KidRock @SenStabenow It was meant to destroy healthcare? Then why do so many millions people still have working healthcare?
People, call your senators and tell them you don't want them to vote on a bill which is not understood. Save healthcare for millions. https://t.co/Mrfd9OmroU
