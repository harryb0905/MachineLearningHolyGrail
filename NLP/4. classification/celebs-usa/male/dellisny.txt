Hey .@PSteely. We’re going to have to get that into the wind tunnel. I think we can probably speed you up.
@stevegillmor Where has the podcast gone? I can’t find it anymore on iTunes or elsewhere. I’ve heard every show since the very start. Help.
Great day with the @Ride_Argyle Brain Trust. It's going to be an exciting 2015! http://t.co/212zm1XCyO
@onenameio Verifying that +dellisny is my openname (my Bitcoin username). https://t.co/OEuy3TzvQV
I am now in possession of these bad boys! Thanks @millarmind  @fizik_ @argyle_panda. Let's see if they fit :) http://t.co/86UbHqPf0s
Fingers crossed for my friend @GinaForRI in the Rhode Island Governors race.
@holowesko 2 of my 3 favorite Marks together without me. Enjoy!
@KlierAndreas please stop distracting the pilot!
@Vaughters Why is JV wearing a tie on Sunday?
@Vaughters Enjoy, but save something for me.
@djetergirl2 @Yale_Football @YaleAthletics @YDNsports Any update on Rymiszewski?
@hblodget @kevinkrim There’s a water main break on Varick and Spring. These may be traffic reporting choppers.
I love the way @DanMartin86 took that final corner. What could have been in his mind?
@argyle_panda It was the Panda Within
Bumped into @JoeDombro at the @GoZwift launch today. Smart and talented kid. Look out!
@millarmind Casa Mingo.
Forget $BABA. I’m waiting for the $ABBA IPO! http://t.co/gtVw16l5Y5
Sorry @Vaughters, we’re going with this kit next year. http://t.co/zjxM2rU2uo
@Vaughters @millarmind Thank you. I’m going to miss you, Dave. At least I will always have your Vuelta @WWF shoes by @fizikofficial!
@ChrisRongey Came to Chicago for a game. Bought an AM radio so I could listen to Ed/Darrin. But there's a delay! Is this tradition over?
@holowesko It seemed to rise on Apple Payments and then fall on the watch.
I watched the final 5k of @ryder_hesjedal's win three times! What a great win and a great stage. http://t.co/AQV610AxN2
@argyle_panda @WWF @millarmind I can't bid against myself!
I just realized that a @Vaughters parody account would be indistinguishable from the real thing. It suggests a new kind of Turing Test.
@HawksiPad @ChrisRongey @Areed43 Why not? What am I missing? I loved his desire for the ball.
@HawksiPad @ChrisRongey Anyone else missing @Areed43? We’d be in like 1st place!
@Vaughters @Ride_Argyle Yes, 10 years. Not exactly today. I hope you saw the 2nd tweet including this metaphor http://t.co/5t21xGuuiK
2/2 I think this clip captures the tone, sobriety, and teamwork of our collaboration. http://t.co/5t21xGuuiK
1/2 On a more serious note, I’d like to celebrate the 10th anniversary of my partnership with @Vaughters at @Ride_Argyle.
I got about 100 retweets, so I did three jumps. I think this one came out best.  http://t.co/N7kNi8VhvD
@Sellebrity_UK @argyle_panda @WWF @millarmind Thank you. I’m on it.
If I get 50 retweets I will jump of the Jaws bridge with my trusty @garmin VIRB and post the video. http://t.co/Y1JTKNrG35
@VIIVOkey should add support for OSX tags. Dropbox maintains the tags, but Viivo doesn't, so they are lost. See code https://t.co/2ppe75lVwY
Question answered! Congrats @alex_howes  "Does anyone know what this kid is up to these days? http://t.co/1p38BwPglM"
Very proud of @tomdanielson's ride today. It showed a lot of character.
@argyle_panda @WWF @millarmind Is that auction up yet? I could not find it and I NEED those shoes.

Where was I?   Mount Talac, above Fallen Leaf Lake.  Lots of great responses.
@irwinmfletcher follow me so I can DM you.
@dnlbenson @philgaimon @Ride_Argyle @cervelo That's cheating, Dan.
Second close guess. Not close enough. RT @irwinmfletcher: @dellisny @Ride_Argyle @cervelo Tahoe?
First close guess. Not close enough. RT @siphev: @dellisny @Ride_Argyle @cervelo Living Room, above SLC?
@TheRaceRadio @Ride_Argyle @cervelo No. Never been there. Thanks for playing and thanks for everything else.

Tommy D! Congratulations @tomdanielson and the whole @Ride_Argyle crew!
I just came across one if those fancy @tinkoff_saxo bottle vests in the wild. Grabbed one for @Ride_Argyle http://t.co/EHo8Ht4rI8
@nealrogers So a double win for @holowesko who is behind both teams.
@BenKing89 Ben, can you please describe what I'm looking at?
@Dropbox you should add user-managed-key encryption (ala viivo). That would protect us more than any legal devices.
Hey @micacquarone, how's the running going? I just ran a quick 5km with some sponsors. http://t.co/j2om2nE3Cv

R. Hunter: I think coming to the Tour and dressing up in a funny costume is beneath me.   G. Brown: Didn't you do that for years?
@nealrogers Set 5km personal best making the connection in Frankfurt. Very grateful for last row middle seat home. #goodluck

@andrewtalansky @Ride_Argyle Great attitude, Andrew. And your 100% correct, especially I f the last two weeks resemble in any way the first.
Spent a great day with a bunch of @transalt leaders. If you don’t know them, they’re the ones making NY streets safe for cyclists.
Ypres claiming its due.
Very sad for @chrisfroome. We all wish he’d had more of a chance to defend.

@Ride_Argyle @holowesko 30 room boutique hotel. Sounds perfect for a training camp. How are the nearby climbs?
@andrewtalansky A fine day at the @Ride_Argyle office on the right front side of the peloton.
A little bit of Peloton Bushwhacking there by @ramunas88, clearing a safe path for @andrewtalansky
@ramunas88 Awesome ride today! Keep up the great work. I will see you in Pau.

@TheRaceRadio Am I going to see you in France? We can fight about this there.
5/5 @TheRaceRadio Or, use the MLB app to track each pitch.
4/5 But, baseball is still appealing if you can put your phone down and enter into the pitcher/batter duels.
3/5 @TheRaceRadio I think that explains some of the World Cup's increased popularity in the US this year. I'm watching every game!
2/5 @TheRaceRadio Soccer is the perfect second screen sport. You can be on Facebook and Twitter and still follow the action.
1/5 @TheRaceRadio To get the most out of baseball you need to focus on each pitch. You have to put your second screen down.
New World has to face overtime with just 10 men.
Old World ties it up at the last moment!
@krederRaymond @tomjelteslagter @DylanvanBaarle @sebaslangeveld @Ride_Argyle Good job, boys!

@TheRaceRadio I know this one. The cycling elite began fiercely debating the upcoming Cesar Garin vs. Lucien Pothier battle at the Tour.
Doesn’t he know he needs to zip up for the photos!  “@mattrabin: @Rockybucket typical Brit abroad… http://t.co/jueV5zvXmX”
@Ride_Argyle @joelindsey Good hint. And, he predates me in the history of our organization.
. @ProCyclingBiz @Bonnie_D_Ford @BicyclingMag @andrewtalansky @joelindsey Smart guess, but no.
. @Bonnie_D_Ford @BicyclingMag @andrewtalansky @joelindsey Full points if you can name the man he's hugging.
@holowesko what's it cost to get a Slipstream logo on that tent?
Winning with heart, style and humility. Congratulations to @andrewtalansky @ryder_hesjedal and all the @Ride_Argyle crew.
@nealrogers @velonews me too
@alex_howes La
@taylorphinney @Bonnie_D_Ford So, do we pencil you in for Talloires? #drafting #cliffdiving
@hblodget @fromedome He built DBKit at NeXT, before the acquisition. I recall a joke he told at a mtg in 1995. Knew then he was a winner.
@Vaughters Is that your resignation?

@holowesko @wesko How cool is that? Congratulations to Liam and the whole Holowesko clan.
@nyvelocity I have you on a list, but I guess that's not enough. Ok, now following.
@Ben_M_Berry Agreed

@micacquarone If you’re in NY, let’s grab a coffee.
Looking forward to @ChristianVDV's commentary at Tour of California.
How is it possible that @BisoBus is still awake and tweeting?
Just heard that @KoldoFernandez broke his clavicle in today's mayhem. Only in cycling does a guy with a broken bone get back in and finish!
Cycling Gods complete job left unfinished at Liege (or should I say Job?). I can’t wait to follow  the rise of @DanMartin86.
A devastatingly cruel mishap for @DanMartin86 today. I know he will surge back as will the @Ride_Argyle boys who remain in the race.
@NathanPeterHaas @wegelius Please ask him to use the hand sanitizer before getting on the bus.
“@Vaughters: Voy a beber Cinco Margaritas para celebrar Cinco de Mayo!”  What does it mean that he tweeted this while on the phone with me?
@BisoBus @CastelliCycling Yes! http://t.co/DaCVMWkIAQ
.@micacquarone Thanks for the inspiration to run here in cold, rainy NY. Had help from @CastelliCycling &amp; @Vaughters http://t.co/nvG2T9jKvJ
I’m very proud of @DanMartin86 and the whole @Ride_Argyle crew today. What courage and character in the face of disappointment!
@alexcone Somehow this doesn’t quite seem like you, Alex.

@PedalingthruOZ @run4b33r Thanks. If I use the footpod and GPS outdoors, does the watch auto-calibrate the pod?
@BrianLehrer I think your missing the point of S&amp;F as it relates to guns. It’s not to collect guns, it’s to deter people from carrying.
@hblodget Love your feed, but at times I find your inconsistent RT style confusing.  Maybe it’s just me. http://t.co/VlY237bITt
@JakesJournal Got a 620, which I love! I have multiple foot pods. Can I pair with more than one, or should I use one watch/pod combination.
@holowesko  Can we have an example?
@millarmind No, not true. The iPhone is great, but change is always difficult. Call me if you need tech support. I used to work for Apple.
@AmericaGovFr @Bonnie_D_Ford Look at the scoreboard.  I think he was actually celebrating the National Anthem performance by the @spizzwink

@inrng Understood. I didn’t mean to distract from your point, which is an important one.
@inrng I think 3 of your 4 numbers can be right, but not all four. It’s a math thing not anything about the amounts in CHF.
@inrng Something must be wrong with that math.

@jimacmcdermott Great news!
@Areed43 No. Buy a hatchet! I flew out to Chicago for Saturday’s game. It was a pleasure to see you close it out. Have a great off season.
@millarmind Can we get a prediction from the three of you?
@nealrogers What’s your prediction? Does it come back together?
It’s @Areed43 time! Come on, shut them down.
Wow. A couple of huge homers by Semien and Danks. #WhiteSox
@alex_howes As they used to say at the America’s Cup: “Yank it back!”
At tomorrow’s game I will watch probably-retiring Paul Konerko with definitely-retired @ChristianVDV.
On my way to US Cellular Field for @whitesox’s last night game.
@dmscott @gerardvroomen What, you need the more formal “Dear %Last Name%”?

@opencycle maybe @SignatureCycles?
@opencycle @gerardvroomen When are we going to have a dealer in NYC?
@SSbike No, please don’t get @nyvelocity started on goggles.
@Ride_Argyle @ChristianVDV Can I get that sign for my office, also known as, the NY @cervelo museum.
@DanMartin86 Glad to hear you’re ok, Dan. Give my best to the boys. Now get some sleep!

@gerardvroomen @philwhite007 @renovandael @Bocavista I would forego the video for the positional data that could drive an app.
@nyvelocity Ah, so A. Schleck isn’t the only one wearing a propeller hat
@gerardvroomen @renovandael With a handful of drones and a bunch of RFID chips you could actually know where every rider is on the road
@gerardvroomen @renovandael Time to start using drones instead.
@Vaughters Can somebody please get JV another copy of the company handbook.
Another flight, another kick ass result by @tomdanielson and @Ride_Argyle at @theTourofUtah. Maybe I need to buy a plane. Congrats!
Just got off a plane and caught up on @tomdanielson’s strong and smart ride at @theTourofUtah.  Nice job, Tommy D!
.@ChrisRongey If the @whitesox ever trade @Areed43, they will have to trade me.

@CyclismasEditor I think Orson Welles invented that approach.
Creating a win-at-all-costs atmosphere is a time-tested way of encouraging athletes to cheat.
@holowesko yes, but what about GDP divided by weight? Steady?
@TheRaceRadio @CyclismasEditor Anyone who can climb Alpe d’Huez in 55 minutes can enjoy as many falafels as he wants.

@Cyclocosm yes, but they didn’t include my 5th tip: please don’t throw urine.
@nyvelocity It looks like Tommy D has hacked your account again. Shut up!
@Cyclocosm Did you find a place in NYC to watch?
Who won this day last year?
@millarmind @MarkCavendish Dave, you missed:  5. No matter how fun it seems, please don’t throw urine.
@Vaughters @nealrogers I’d like to think we’ve met in the middle. With Neal’s help.
@nealrogers Just don’t clean the beer and then…
@DavidWalshST What do you mean by ‘another’? The same again, or a different reaction?
@TheRaceRadio @nealrogers My money is on the panda.

@icasso1 @DanMartin86 @Ride_Argyle We have the panda waiting near the summit.
@millarmind That looks like a page from the “Men of Cycling” calendar. Mr. July, perhaps.

@TheRaceRadio This slow drip of truth is deadly. The sport would benefit hugely from T&amp;R. Get it all out there once and for all.
@TheRaceRadio @nealrogers What’s funny is that I was staying at Bagni Nuovi in Bormio. The hot and cold baths got me started on recovery.
@nealrogers Hey Neal, me too. Rode up the Stelvio on Friday and then my back locked up. Get well soon.
@MuriloFischerMF I’m doing the Stelvio tomorrow.  Will I see you there?
@MuriloFischerMF Really?  I was in a tunnel of pain, so I didn’t see you. Sorry to miss the chance to say hello.
Morning in Arabba. http://t.co/Pq1OGlgLjC
My trusty @cervelo S3 served me well up and down Monte Bondone, but it can't help with the leg cramps. http://t.co/KwXyXbtJUn
@b_gulienetti I’m up in lovely Trento for some tough cycling.  It’s hot, but beautiful.
Just arrived in Italy for a week of riding. Good news: 6 guys, 8 @garmin Edge devices. Bad news: I’m tech support.
@mattrabin @GhostofRicco @RohanDennis That one is scary, Matt
@b_gulienetti We made 24. It took forever. There was frosting all over the kitchen! But, he got a lot of great attention walking to school.
@DanMartin86 You’re going to have to send me a few of those for batch testing.
@b_gulienetti Look what Anton and I cooked up! http://t.co/v3tFtsD1kh
End of year cupcakes. Harder than it looks. http://t.co/sSPbrnmW4I

@TheRaceRadio I think there may be gold flakes under the croutons.
@ChrisRongey Never mind.
@ChrisRongey I’m telling you, as the weather warms, the defense returns.
@billgifford @Vaughters @BW If it’s really true that “Cycling is the new Golf”, we’ll get him to accept this.
I think the @whitesox struggles with defense were due to the cold Spring. As the weather warmed, the defense came back. #WhiteSoxTalk
Get well soon @ryder_hesjedal http://t.co/pvinMSZwXM
@hblodget I remember him speaking at a NeXT DBKit training class I took in the 90’s. he was a star, then, too.
@hblodget @SAI it’s live on Apple TV. That’s cool.
@badbrainAJ @Vaughters OK.  It looks like the next time we rent out @BoulderTheater it’s going to be for a Star Wars marathon.
@Vaughters Just consider it as an opportunity to re-experience the movies.
@nyvelocity We didn’t give him a little ring.
I just completed my first ride on @CitibikeNYC.  Incredible!  What a fantastic way to move around the city.
Whoa! @gordonbeckham back in the lineup!  Welcome home. #WhiteSox
@BisoBus @KlierAndreas Full points.
@KlierAndreas It’s a no-brainer:  Mac.
@Vaughters Even marble burns.
@DanielCoyle Betting is a great way to up your interest in a sport you don’t care much about.  For me, that would be basketball.  For you…
@swissed78 Yes!  We can preload routes to nearest hospitals
Day one of NY Bike Share. Either the bikes have been stolen or it's working. http://t.co/jO7zLaLr8P
@dzabriskie I’m not touching that one.
@nyvelocity And, the bikes are in! http://t.co/QmoCHaBQo3
@gerardvroomen @nyvelocity Gerard, there was a typo. It was supposed to read “Blight future”
@mattrabin Where is @ramunas88?  I bet he’s up in the break.
@Emma_OReilly View from mine. http://t.co/9UiEd7ajp7
@b_gulienetti Sadly, no.  It’s been a crazy race with wild weather.
@b_gulienetti @RobertaPiga Here is mine.  Actually, I had some help from Anton! http://t.co/DbF6C6nvYZ
@ChrisRongey Why not just keep Axelrod in the game until he falters?  We are just outsmarting ourselves.
White Sox vs. Red Sox.  This is causing family tensions.
@ChrisRongey I enjoyed that article on framing.  Where do you think our boys stack up?
@badbrainAJ Maybe this bad boy. http://t.co/qPuOkR3ol0
I’m thinking of doing the @ChristianVDV Grand Fondo on 9/28. Maybe we’ll go to @whitesox  game that night vs. KC. http://t.co/W3mvwBvIBX
@inrng @Vaughters Make him purchase his copy.
@nealrogers Looks like we have a nice day for you here in NYC, Neal.
I’m sorry they had to remove the Sestriere from today’s stage. The long descent from the top into Pinerolo is my favorite ride in the world!
Nice to see Johan van Summeren featured in that NBC Sports ad.
@wesko I like the socks!
@dbrogan Exactly!
@ryder_hesjedal Get well soon

@Ben_M_Berry @CyclismasEditor @peddler54 @Ride_Argyle It was my birthday!
@pelotonfollower No. Not the Twins. Can we have a truce.
@CyclismasEditor @peddler54 @Ride_Argyle May 18, 2010. Giro &amp; ToC. Farrar and Zabriskie!
JV, great day for the boys around the world. The champagne is on me! @Vaughters @Ride_Argyle
@nealrogers And the White Sox won. That’s the official MLB team of @Ride_Argyle. So it’s 3!
Hell yeah. Tyler.
Here’s what happened the first time we tried to win a Giro stage @millarmind http://t.co/UNFKYwttun
Congratulations to @ramunas88!  We sure needed that!
@DavidWalshST The first time we were close to a Giro stage win we got that spectacular David Millar bike throw!
Eik, vyras, eikite!
It’s great to see @Ride_Argyle and BMC working well together at the front.  You don’t see that every day. #Giro
Lots of respect for @ryder_hesjedal and his response to difficulty.  http://t.co/1Kupmm2o1O
.@ChrisRongey  I’m getting tired of if all these blown calls in MLB.  The sport needs better technology review.

@TheRaceRadio Where are your seats, the space station?
@millarmind Get some sleep!  G’night.
@millarmind Did Dave just fall asleep in the middle of his list?
Phil says Thor never regained his form after his world champ win.  What about his three stage wins and 7 days in yellow at the Tour in 2011?
Who is in that Nibali group?  I can see a couple of Movistar and maybe a Liquigas.
Monsoon season continues here in NYC. http://t.co/u8qtM910nF
I wouldn’t mind a few more time splits, official or not, to better judge the race along the way.
Go @ryder_hesjedal
Watching Euro Sport and saw @wegelius describing the TT.  He is identified as Doug Ellis!
@garmin I want my Edge 810 to prompt me to eat/drink based on kilojoule expenditure or mileage.  It’s too easy to forget!
Smart riding by @ryder_hesjedal (now 3rd) and @tomdanielson (now 16th).  I’m glad they’re home safe! #Giro
@_thisistheone_ Looks safe in the chase, but it’s heavy rain and lost of crashing.  We will know more soon.
“Riders down” sound way too close to “Ryder’s down”
I love Citi Field. I got carded two days in a row. I’m like 50!
@ChrisRongey Robin throwing BP? http://t.co/VtA3Hc4nIV

I’m very proud of the ballsy riding by @ryder_hesjedal  and the @Ride_Argyle gang today. Dynamic, unpredictable racing is wonderful for fans
How many of our guys are still there? 8?
Good to see the OPQS boys using their trusted @Garmin devices
.@micacquarone Beautiful setting for the stage today.  Yet another place in Italy I must visit.
@michelkreder Great job, Michel. Congratulations!
@millarmind Nice product placement for VCRC bag!
@NathanPeterHaas Have a blast, Nathan!
Heee’s gone!  @2013WhiteSox win!
@ChristianVDV @julienpretotRTR I know. I froze my butt off last week, but got them on a 3 game streak. Sale pitched a great one last night.
@julienpretotRTR @ChristianVDV We had to leave him off the team because of the 140 character tweet limit.
@dellisny AND, Christain Vande Velde @ChristianVDV, of course!

@Digger_forum @nyvelocity @Ben_M_Berry And I - on twitter, don’t know about the forum - sincerely seconded the sentiment and added a joke.
@Digger_forum I will second that! (Except where you call Shen a woman)
@Vaughters As @JoshMalina once told me, “They say kissing a smoker is like licking an ashtray. That’s good to remember when you’re lonely”
@SC_Cycling @nealrogers Perhaps the bait isn’t intended for Froome.

Thanks to @stevevdz, I rode hill repeats of Alpine in Palisades Park.  What a great way to ride your bike in New York!
@SSbike good point.
@UCI_Overlord @SSbike The reaction on his face when asked if was surprised is pretty disheartening.
When I was a kid I was a Red Sox fan. The TV voice was Ken Harrelson. Now I’m a White Sox fan, It’s @WhiteSoxHawk Harrelson!  #reassuring
I still think when you get picked 2nd in the NFL draft, you get off your phone.  That’s how old I am.

No photo finish for @DanMartin86 today!  Huge win for him and the boys.  Now do you see why cycling is a team sport?
Rode a cold 80km up to Piermont today on my @cervelo R5CA. What a beautiful ride!
@whitesox Win!

@Larryvich Yum! See you there.
@swissed78 Thanks, Chris. That did the trick.
@Ben_M_Berry I haven’t tried mine yet. I’ve used all other models and loved them. I need turn-by-turn so I can get home after I get dropped!
@Garmin What’s the most detailed (topo?) map of Italy for my new Garmin 810?  I’m going on a riding trip and need an edge.
.@DanMartin86: http://t.co/SJ0N5wl0Gj Looks like a @newbalance ad. Have a good one!
@Garmin Help!  Predictably, I managed to lose one of the four screws on the back of my trusty FR70. What do I do now?
S&amp;P just bounced 5 points on news of @DanMartin86’s daring win at #voltacatalunya
@tomdanielson Welcome back, Tom!
@millarmind Why does Tyler look so happy?  Reminds me of him after that epic Strada Bianca Stage 7 of the 2010 Giro.
@CyclismasEditor  @tweetbot  is a delight on all platforms, Lesli
@nyvelocity @mmmaiko Agreed.  Love the Jörg Jaksche entry.  @jorgjaksche?
Lots of great offense from the ChiSox in spring training.  That and their strong rotation make them look pretty solid to me.
As usual, @holowesko’s thoughts on the business of cycling are right on target http://t.co/VtQpJK30GG.  Can we effect the changes we need?
@CyclismasEditor @Vaughters I tried to warn him about all those Skull and Bones jokes.
@CyclismasEditor @Vaughters I think he my be involved in a hazing ritual.
Very inspired by Long Now talk by @chr1sa  about the Maker Movement.  Might have to quit my job.  Wait, what job? http://t.co/pIDeIFTula

@UCI_Overlord @CyclismasEditor And heaven knows I’m miserable now.
@micacquarone @TheRaceRadio My error. I believed what I read online! I should have asked JV. Anyway, it looks to be a beautiful event.
@TheRaceRadio @micacquarone @Vaughters I was thinking CAS appeal, but that’s become trendy. Imagine, a bike race that finishes in The Forum!
@TheRaceRadio @micacquarone Agreed, but how could they leave us, @Ride_Argyle, out?  Rome is my home town!  Racing the Via Appia!  Epic!

.@Ben_M_Berry Yes.  I’m loving it.  Just went back and re-watched Beautiful Girls.  Vintage Emmerich!
@michaeljgreaves @Vaughters Augustine was also big on torturing heretics. Could come in handy during Truth and Reconciliation.
Just finished episode 2 of @TheAmericansFX. That 80’s era Cold War dynamic suddenly seems familiar and reassuring.

If funding Truth &amp; Reconciliation is really an issue, let’s put @nyvelocity and @UCI_Overlord to work. They killed it with @PaulKimmage
@CyclismasEditor @ChristianVDV I like CVV’s word
@nyvelocity I was referring to @badbrainAJ’s clear gloating about the superior beer situation in London.  Sorry, I’m hours behind.
@badbrainAJ @nyvelocity Stop gloating!

@Ben_M_Berry @UCI_Overlord Me, too. The argyle stands for Slipstream.
@UCI_Overlord Or, more succinctly: “He ain’t heavy, he’s my sponsor”.
@UCI_Overlord The é is sized correctly. It reflects the substantial investment these weapon-makers place in our program. We wear it proudly!

@dwuori @dzabriskie is a winner and a tremendous team member. Been through a lot and persevered.  He should be an inspiration to us all.
@wegelius No.  Just don’t give away our secrets.
@holowesko I think it was your idea in the first place.
@nealrogers yes. Especially if you use lists.
Just switched to tweetbot. Wow.
.@SSbike @holowesko Maybe it's time for a sponsor summit. If the people putting money into the sport demand change, there must be change.

@tomdanielson @cervelo Or, fill the downtube with Go-Gurt. Worked for us.
@DanMartin86 A couple of years ago I had a great bottle of Bordeaux confiscated. I begged them to drink it themselves, but they tossed it.
What a fantastic battle today at the Vuelta.
@dpamac @vaughters @nyvelocity @dwuori @inrng @uci_overlord Don't give up yet, I think I have one line left.
@dwuori @nyvelocity @inrng @UCI_Overlord Now might be a good time to revisit Truth and Reconciliation, before the supernova ignites.
@ChristianVDV The whiplash is vicious.
It would be interesting to see (# of tweets / # of followers) statistic for people. It's a huge range.
@Ride_Argyle @andrewtalansky Maybe picked up a place in the overall?
Great ride again by @andrewtalansky
@cycletard @inrng @UCI_Overlord Cav isn't changing teams as much as he's changing bikes. Follow the money. I bet on Specialized.

@holowesko Jealous if you saw George Michaels perform.  Seriously!
@Ride_Argyle how far to go and what's the route like?  I'm challenged for info.
Just saw the argyle on the US men's beach volleyball kit. @Vaughters, call the lawyers.
Looks like it might be a different double for Fabs this year. Hope not.
Can Cancellara pull off an Olympic double win?
@nyvelocity @vaughters Precisely. Ice fishing tomorrow 7am under the Veranzano, weather permitting.  Shirt fitting in the afternoon.
@nyvelocity I think you're going to need testing at the roller races this year.  Welcome to prime time!
@cervelo Thanks, Phil.  That was fun to follow.
@nyvelocity Wiggins got "turd"
Surely, it's now or never.
Where is Thibaut Pinot?  Can't tell.
@nyvelocity Looking forward to the roller racing this Fall.  It will be my "turd"
Tough, tough man, that @ghincapie
Great to see Dan Martin in the break and  feeling strong after mid-race illness
@Vaughters ok, rechecking my bags now.
@nyvelocity now you're the one giving away the secrets.
@nyvelocity that's what everyone feared in the team meeting.
@nyvelocity was the Millar break caught?
@nyvelocity: "Wiggins and Froome thanking Tejay under their breaths now.” &lt;&lt; I don't follow
“@millarmind: Ok, so this is a mad tribute: http://t.co/VdbO4iLY Thank you @CPbike.” &lt;&lt; What's next Vandeveldetime? Vansummerentime?

@SSbike Should just improve my French!
@SSbike thanks  I'm using http://t.co/PDpj5tuG which is good
@jdanton Thanks.  That works great.
I'm trying to find some live English audio for today's stage.  Any pointers?  I'm in France.
@RobbieHunter Sorry to see you go. I was looking forward to seeing you next week. Get well soon.
.@dzabriskie just said "Losing time is one thing, having your life is another."  Good perspective on a bad day.
Lots of respect for @tomdanielson for soldiering on despite the pain http://t.co/EyoJDqZE
.@millarmind, I just saw the great news http://t.co/Qij1DQH2.  Congrats.  It's been a long journey.
Nice to see @ChristianVDV taking good care of @DanMartin86
@argylearmada Two guys from my riding trip bumped into him (@iamtedking) on a summit yesterday. Small world.
“@millarmind: My book is released in the US today. It even has it's own website. Have a look if you like: http://t.co/D4ND0DLk” -- congrats
@holowesko A lot of that transportation # must be for food. If we ate more locally, that number could come way down.
@holowesko Or the people's expectations.

Anyone else worried we haven't heard from @Vaughters since he was wandering the Bowery, pursued by wildlife?
My friend Chad crashed today on our ride. Look at his shoulder. http://t.co/kU5eoLeL
@BisoBus it sounds beautiful. Say hello the Sean.
@BisoBus Where?
@Vaughters I know it's not your style, but you should try a beer garden while there.
Beautiful and provoking piece by good friend @JaneMendelsohn in NYT.  Take a look: http://t.co/gJC17JqT
A big Happy Birthday to my partner in crime, @Vaughters.  You sure do know how to stir it up!  Looking forward to an action packed summer.
@nealrogers Now I can't wait
@jeffreytlau I just saw that you won the contest. Congratulations and thank you for your support and kind words.
@JeffreyTLau Thank you for the kind words.
I'm speechless. What a win by @ryder_hesjedal, the team and the staff. Party tonight in Milan.
Great job by @ChristianVDV getting into the break.
I bet the price just went up on @ryder_hesjedal 's Maui-based winter camp.
Unbelievable!  Weight of a Nation
Watching the Euro Sport feed if the Giro now: http://t.co/2CdpstZG
@timmydugganJGH is a classy rider and an even classier guy
Loved seeing @ryder_hesjedal diligently stopping his Garmin as he crossed the line.    Would have been the last thing on my mind.
Fantastic ride by @ryder_hesjedal to steal back the jersey!
Brave attack by @ryder_hesjedal
@holowesko I'm jealous. Barolo is a great town and I love the wine.
Good to see  Haussler (13) back in the group after helping out Talansky
@Vaughters That was one hell of a day!
“@sarcastitom: @Ride_Argyle Nerd.” You have no idea.
@Pinkfully I don't understand the question, so I think no.
“@Ride_Argyle: . @robbiehunter stopped w/ @ryder_hesjedal to help. Now the chase! #Giro” &lt;&lt; Think that is Peter not Ryder
Really enjoyed @dnlbenson  article http://t.co/39dC4jNh on today's stage.  It brought it all back.

Then my Virtual Partner caught me, stared me down, gave me the finger, and dropped me. It was humiliating.
I had him beat by 20 seconds through to the Dutch Corner.

@stevegillmor I'd love to get an mp3 of the original Gillmor Gang theme song. Do you have that?
I agree with Gerard http://t.co/Nd5GP1y. What's more, Thor's sacrificial teamwork helped deliver the win. Bittersweet for him I'm sure.
