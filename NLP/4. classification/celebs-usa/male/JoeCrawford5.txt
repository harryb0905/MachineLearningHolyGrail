@WillieMac_Jr Trolling to the max!!!
@LifeWitDerek_ Nope
@Skillsspay 🙌🏿
@AdubbDaGawd Lmao
@G_W_85 True!!!
@Flight8 I remember that we was trippin after the game like that nigga jumped to high to dunk
@MGRADS @DWRIGHTWAY1 Locked in
@BaldJesusFareal I agree that’s exactly what I said but dudes be giving Bron a pass tho
They gotta learn to be deadly in their spots during the game and not Kyrie’s spots.
The Celtics can beat everybody in the east without Kyrie right now!! But they gotta learn to follow him to win a championship. Some of the guys are so talented that they want it to be their time now!! Which is understandable but is also the problem.
@BaldJesusFareal Yea they play better without him but they can win a championship with him. They just don’t wanna accepted their roles with him. Kyrie has to establish that leadership presence to get them in line.
@E3_EZ @G_W_85 Detroit had some hoopers
@BenJonesLive Bro u always been crazy

MELO coulda helped that load too if y’all wasn’t so quick to blame him.
The rockets are putting too much pressure on cp3 to create all season. Get him a scoring playmaking backup so he can be fresh for the playoffs.

@aechrapbrown 😂😂😂😂😂
@aechrapbrown Ur comparing the differences instead of comparing the similarities that make them great. Longevity and determination I’m done lol.
@aechrapbrown No bro cuz he already went from the free throw line. He’s doing something else now.
@aechrapbrown No it’s not from the free throw line but it’s special in its on way. And could be viewed as better depending on the circumstances. Lol
@aechrapbrown Lmao no bro that’s not the same. It’s like if Michael Jordan was to dunk right now and put it on the gram. Ppl are still going to go crazy bc of his legacy.
@aechrapbrown It’s more power behind the punches bc of that
@aechrapbrown He def got privilege but he earned that. He breathing rare air right now dog. He rappin and backin community
@aechrapbrown He’s then doing everything he rappin in that verse. Nobody in the game has done that and especially to level he’s doing it.
@aechrapbrown The time we are in right now for him to deliver that is crazy to me.
@aechrapbrown The timing of the verse has a lot to do with how good it is
@aechrapbrown Noooooo way
