@Jayblac1615 Naw but I thought it was a smaller event too. Sadly mistaken. Haha.
@Jayblac1615 I thought the point of banned legacy was to be surprised by the battles and match ups. Why is everybody revealing who battled and how it went

@NFL @RapSheet Good for you Joe!! 👏🏾👏🏾 You’ll do great there!!
Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus Philippians 2:2-5
@MickeyFactz We need Robin Williams. I’ll never in life disrespect Will. He’s arguably the GOAT. But because I was a kid when it came out Robin Williams would make it complete. Just like James Earl Jones being in Lion King makes it official.

4-3, 3-4, 5-2, Nose guard, 3-tech, DE, doesn’t matter. Either you can play football or you can’t. PERIOD!!
A lot of people resist transition and therefore never allow themselves to enjoy who they are. Embrace the change, no matter what it is; once you do, you can learn about the new world you're in and take advantage of it.

@The_TIMtations 👎🏾
@King_Learynidas Yea that’s false!!
@AYEVERB 👀
@mizzyszn I said nothing about the movie. 🤷🏾‍♂️
@King_Learynidas Yes, because the Justice League put fear in that man heart.
@AYEVERB Man I ain’t talking about the movie. I’m talking about the power the team possesses. Haha
@ChrisJustice False!! Carry on!!
@StephenVaughn13 Cleveland had Lebron, Bulls had Jordan, Lakers had Shaq. Who cares who the best player is. The team gets the credit!! 🤷🏾‍♂️ All about a mindset.
Idk if people understand how powerful the Justice League is. In the story WW told Batman she said the first time Steppenwolf showed up it took multiple Atlanteans, Amazons, Humans, Gods and Goddesses. And he had killed millions before. But these 6 heroes take him out. Sheesh!!
@codeezie45 @gregauman The post had nothing to do with that. It was to acknowledge a good play and a great person. Just stick with that. Miss me with the what we remember. I played in it. I know the result. But in a positive post like that why bring up negative. Absolutely pointless.
@gregauman Way to find negative in a positive post. And y’all wonder why we have issues talking to y’all. Pointless to point out negative in this situation.
@ScissorhandsOKC Hahahaha I already know that dogg.
@ScissorhandsOKC @Browns @OU_Football Tighten up Scissor!!
@louisptack Preciate it brotha
@gregauman The disrespect. 🤦🏾‍♂️
@DavisLauderdale https://t.co/1qkqK9ZwyZ
@JazTheRapper Yea it had some cold stuff but dang. The reaches were a little shaky but that didn’t matter. I just thought it was dope but to give him the rd off that alone? Naw!!
@JazTheRapper Come on lil sis y’all was bugging. I rewatched the battle again and you was OD over that Alcohol scheme. You and Tech was on one on Champion too. @Jayblac1615 reactions had me crying.

@1_900_ayersjr @Jroc5554 @clj94104 No I agree with you saying everything is so guard based. Hahahaha
@1_900_ayersjr @dnottingham1 @barrettwr87 @PapaLou702 @Buccaneers @getnickwright https://t.co/XQzve3suNO
@1_900_ayersjr @Jroc5554 @clj94104 The only thing we will probably EVER agree on. Hahaha
@1_900_ayersjr @clj94104 Hahahahahaha
@dnottingham1 @1_900_ayersjr @barrettwr87 @PapaLou702 @Buccaneers @getnickwright It says Volumes about the voters judging him by his off the court issues instead of his on court production. Not saying he was right. But I believe there was more to him not being voted in. Same with Shaq getting robbed while in MIA.
@1_900_ayersjr @clj94104 Hahahahahaha
@clj94104 @1_900_ayersjr I know how you meant it. But my point still remains. That’s not how you jump in a convo. You’re more than welcomed to make your point but that’s not how you start it. NOW............. Jordan is the GOAT. But that’s not the point here.
@dnottingham1 @1_900_ayersjr We really comparing Scottie to Kobe right now? Come on man. Stop!!
@clj94104 @1_900_ayersjr No let me help you. Never tell 2 grown men to shut up that you don’t know. That’s dangerous territory. Have a good day sir!!
@1_900_ayersjr @barrettwr87 @PapaLou702 @Buccaneers @getnickwright Don’t seem to see that stat here sir https://t.co/vtEO7scQyb

@dnottingham1 @1_900_ayersjr Daniel sir...... Why do you keep bringing up Lebron. We’re talking about Tim Duncan.
@1_900_ayersjr @Jachalp3 Hahahahaha
@mauger345 @1_900_ayersjr Because he’s talking about missing playoffs. Nobody wins by themselves. Supporting cast and coaching plays a huge part in making the playoffs. 🤷🏾‍♂️

@barrettwr87 @PapaLou702 @1_900_ayersjr @Buccaneers 👀🤷🏾‍♂️

@PapaLou702 @1_900_ayersjr Luis go away!! Hahaha
@1_900_ayersjr You ain’t bout to just discredit my dogg. You can’t argue a Kobe argument anyway because you’re bias. You find any way to hate on Kobe. Somebody say something bad about Kobe and this is you........ https://t.co/bIZfP40s5g
@1_900_ayersjr Rob don’t start. Timmy is GREAT. But he never played without Pop. He had David Robinson, Ginobli, Tony Parker, Bruce Bowen, Kawhi Leonard, Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott etc....... None of them are Shaq but come on don’t act like his teams were wack. Tim Duncan never not had a squad
@jetreid @dmorg91 Because I said she is!! 🤷🏾‍♂️

@vato1hunnit What about it?
@DJPRINCEDC @buc1CANE1ers Anybody can create a video with who they think will win. That’s my opinion. But if you say Black Panther you have a valid argument. I’ve seen videos where Batman won. Crossover of universes so I guess we’ll never know. 🤷🏾‍♂️
@Beau_Allen @Microsoft @Xbox Hahahahahaha right!!
@ppladow @jayRecher No sir. I have a little thing going on right now called training camp. It’s kinda important so I can’t miss it. Hahaha
@BruceMaduri @Buccaneers @SportsTalkFLA @newstalkflorida Gonna be a fun ride. I appreciate you helping me on this journey to complete my moms vision. We’re gonna change so many lives brotha.
@buc1CANE1ers @DJPRINCEDC Batman because of his preparation. And I love black panther but Batman is always overly prepared. He has the same level resources and gadgets. He’ll find vibranum somewhere trust me. He found Cryptonite when he fought Superman. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Find a way to be a blessing to somebody else today. Even if it’s just something as minimal as holding the door for somebody. You’d be surprised how something so small can be a blessing to somebody.
@jayRecher Thank you brotha!!

@AYEVERB You tried your hardest to not react too much to @ThekidJ_c bars vs KD because you was the host but that boy 2nd rd was too potent!! It’s ok man. He an alien. We all fall victim to his bs. Hahaha. Fall off a bridge for writing like that JC.

@streetstarnorbe Case in point: who calls a lion sexy? Boy when she wake and realize you’re a weirdo it’s gonna get ugly. Only thing saving you is that beautiful baby you made.
@streetstarnorbe Definitely built like an animal. Let’s take a wild guess which one........ 🤔
@streetstarnorbe Take what out? Hahaha. I can’t help reality. And reality is Amanda one day is gonna realize the truth.
@streetstarnorbe How long until Amanda realizes she made a mistake?
@thejessefresh @MikeEvans13_ Also how about you research a person before you try and tear them down. You obviously don’t know me or anything about me if you think what you said has any validity. This ain’t about me. This is about teaching you about how to approach anybody moving forward. Be good man!!
@thejessefresh @MikeEvans13_ See a lesser persons reaction would be to disrespect you back since you disrespected me and spoke on something you have 0 idea about. But I’m just gonna say this. Mike is a great man and very selfless. You can build him up without trying to tear somebody else down. God bless man

@Xclu21 My character. You don’t know me. How you know my character? You go off what an article says. The boy can ball. Bottom line. Who cares why he went where he went. I like how he plays basketball. Stop reaching man.
Hahahaha people really mad at me because I like KD. 🤷🏾‍♂️
@hey_hogan It’s never easy. It’s pro sports. I love my city and my team. I’ll pass. I’m a Buc until they kick me out.

@Xclu21 Hahahaha you got all that because I’m a fan of a player. Who I like as a player determines what goes on on my team. Boy y’all “fans” funny.
@RickyP6 What does that have to do with him going to a team with an established 2 time MVP and winning 2 back to back rings and finals MVP. He didn’t go in and take a back seat. He was at the forefront.
@hey_hogan Things change!!
@NavtasticHD False!!
KDDDDDDDDDDDD!!! Like I said, Hate all yall want. He went into their organization and took over!! KD bout all that!! Don’t really care about the team. I’m happy for KD!!

@TruBucfan22 And you claim you’re a true Bucs fan. True Bucs fans would know that’s not what I’m doing because I’ve never done it. Tighten up man!!
@TruBucfan22 Define undermining. Last I checked it would be to attack indirectly or in secret. Ive never publicly done that and never will to our GM or coach. I say what I want to whoever I want straight to their face. No need to be secretive about it. That’s what punks do. Stop with the bs.

@1acordero The movie is out on DVD. If you haven’t seen it at this point idk what to tell you.
@CstomMadeMenace Doesn’t matter. If you can harness lightning and it runs through your body without a problem. When you get shocked with a taser it shouldn’t phase you. As Thor said he used the biggest lightning strike of all time. So a tiny taser shouldn’t phase him
@dekodawatson57 #readyready
@JonLeeBrody He used em vs Hulk though
@CstomMadeMenace He used it on Hulk
🤔🤔🤔
Wait wait wait if Thor is the God of Thunder and Lightning...... How in Ragnarok were they keeping him captive with tasers and electrocuting him when he got out of order?
@fmassa88 @Starbucks No what you have is a problem!!

Baker making things happen. Great job keeping plays alive.
Please get to safety. No need to chance it. God bless you all!!

@LavonteDavid54 @WILL_GHOLSTON2 @NBA Dogg I seen your jumper in the locker room. Just keep running them sprints and be ready the 27th.
@Vada_Fly That's crazy!! I'd never wish that on anybody. But as a father myself if I was putting my kids in a situation as such I'd back off some.
@Vada_Fly I honestly don't think he's like that but I hope he develops into something we can use. Do I think he'll be a Kobe, KD, or even Steph... NO!
@Vada_Fly FACTS!! Ultimate market!! Also with his pops being extra all the time. He's a 🎯
@Vada_Fly FACT!! I'm a Lakers fan and I'm always optimistic. I don't like how his pops is but oh well. Has nothing to do with hoping he works out.
@Vada_Fly So was Kobe and Jordan when he first came into the league but 20 yrs later and their name is in the same sentence. Just saying...... 🤷🏾‍♂️

@NUJERZEYTWORK Your pen/showmanship/presence, jakk energy and performance, Ryda slick word play, and drugz aggression... People know its real No friends!
@NUJERZEYTWORK Rome just a little different man. But I mess with the Goonies as a whole. Y'all shaking the game up right now. A much needed movement!!
@benpayne_52 @Pln82658Nelson @SoonerThunder51 @What_A_Star5 @CoachThibbs Not arguing. Just think the analysis is hilarious!!

@kwon I see y'all are shopping at little mans wear house!! H&amp;M where big dudes are not allowed!!
@JakkBoyMaine Bet!! Haha
@RomeDMV Ok manager. I need a 1-on-1 for my boy Jack!! I already know what happened behind the scenes. I need a replacement battle. ITS TIME!!
@Vada_Fly @Jayblac1615 I think it's time for a Champion episode. Might need to break some stuff down!! Even if I have to call into the show.
@JakkBoyMaine Post the score afterwards. I want to see how successful you are.
@RomeDMV Last thing...... I never questioned your work ethic or your managing skills. Not even what I was talking about.
@RomeDMV Word of advice. Don't focus on outside opinion. In professional entertainment if you react to every outside opinion you'll go crazy.
@JakkBoyMaine Hahahahahaha who you playing with? And I bet you playing on rookie!!
@smac1885 @RomeDMV FYI Sean don't take me so serious. Battle rap is a hobby buddy. I don't really care what anybody does. Just all in fun!!
@smac1885 @RomeDMV FACTS- Without the great shows his "clients" put on his marketing skills mean 0. Im in professional entertainment. I know how this works.
@RomeDMV The entire group is dope!! I love what the Goonies bring to battle rap. But. YOU cant take credit for them being branded right.
@RomeDMV Are you doing it or is the fact that all of em are extremely talented doing it!?! I'm pretty sure with or without my guy they'd be dope
@RomeDMV @keithjr520 @Real_DealRaps Rome come on bruh? You a fire manager? Really? Please explain. Out of sheer amusement I'll entertain your answer.
@coachbpnc Yea coach!! Thanx man
@Real_DealRaps Twork makes em relevant in my opinion, but it's Twork, Jack boy, Ryda, Drugs and the lamest manager ever Rome DMV.
@DCYOUNGFLY FACTS!! Always been one of my motivators!!
@Heavybag201 @JohnJohnDaDon Battle rap needs a storyline at all times to stay relevant. That's URL's right now. The goonies are the new villains.
@KadenceOKC Hahahaha

@DreamsOfDoom I'm not hating. I think he's dominant. I was being funny. Boy sit down somewhere. Go be sensitive on somebody else timeline.
Lebron tired man!! You can just see it. He's pushing hisself but he's wearing down in my opinion. Golden State just have so much energy.
@ChrisHarrisJr He a bully. He literally has no handles. Just blow past people or push em out the way. And it's so affective. And he knows it. Its hilarious
@NANOSQDX Yea that's my guy.

@Fano_Kgops Verb and Hitman took out Ars. Verb took out Brizz. Hitman performance tops Brizz. Verb wittyness patterned with his disrespect. Nice try
@Fano_Kgops Showtime and Remix are 2 of the most influential moves in battle rap history. There is no other moves combined that can beat that. I'm sorry
@JazTheRapper  https://t.co/Z6U2eqg2EB

The thing I miss about Oklahoma on hot days like this are the snow cone stands on every corner!!
@isthismike_p Well you definitely have numerous moments on your resumé. And you're steady ascending. Keep up the grind. You have a fan in Tampa.
@isthismike_p My thinking is how did you know it to just rap it. But flow with it. Change the pace. Bc that wouldn't of hit the same just being rapped.
@RaiseHavoc LOVE IT!! Kinda would of loved to see him be the next Wolverine though.
@isthismike_p I just tried to say it like you and choked like 3 times. Haha.
@isthismike_p Dogg BARS!! This is crazy!! More so how you put it together than the lyrics. How you come up with the flow? Or decide how to rap it?

@UnbiasReview @Jayblac1615 One thing I think yall didnt mention is the lack of originality and moments. Too much cloning and not enough moments in battle rap anymore.
@UnbiasReview @Jayblac1615 If you're talking about the how battle rap has changed yea I watched that. I agree with a lot that was said.
@UnbiasReview @Jayblac1615 Exactly. Overtime there has to be a list of things we can name if done at the right time will cause an uproar. (Chess voice) Think about it
@Jayblac1615 @UnbiasReview Ex: Qleen took his jacket off and the crowd went crazy. Rex slam his hat and it takes the roof off the place
@Jayblac1615 @UnbiasReview One of you guys should do a blog on all the things battlers do in battles that hit almost like bar.

@CMathews2002 Yea this pic is extra dope!!
@streetstarnorbe I'm wit it
@streetstarnorbe Hahaha I hope so. It means he got drafted!!
@streetstarnorbe Yes sir it was
@streetstarnorbe That's what I was thinking too. Preciate it my brotha. You still built like a momma penguin!! Love you though. Haha
@streetstarnorbe Gotcha
@streetstarnorbe Do you lose the entire rd if you get it back though? Especially if your rd is crazy you just fumble a little bit
@UnbiasReview @Jayblac1615 @streetstarnorbe I still fell chess won 2nd rd even with choke. Bc he got it back and went bananas.
@UnbiasReview @Jayblac1615 @streetstarnorbe Well he explained why he did that. So I can't use that. How about Chess vs Dougy?
@Jayblac1615 @streetstarnorbe @UnbiasReview And go crazy you still can win that rd if the other persons isn't as good overall
@Jayblac1615 @streetstarnorbe @UnbiasReview Personally I feel if the choke isn't significant and you don't give up the rd, you get it back..
@Jayblac1615 @streetstarnorbe @UnbiasReview Question of the day. Does choking make you automatically lose the rd or do you just lose points?
What is going on with Thor? I need a teaser or something. Nothing!!

@WhoDat_Joness All good man. I don't take it personal my brotha!! Love fans of their teams. Keep screaming in the dome. Love playing there
@whitspen Bc it hurt me to my heart what happened to that man. Doesn't take away how I feel about what happened to both those men
@WhoDat_Joness What's so funny!?!
@WhoDat_Joness We beat you guys once last yr. Keep rooting for your team though. We'll see this yr. Be good my man. See you in the dome.
@ReggieAintSHIT My wife is black man. My parents are black. All my kids are black. My mindset is deeper. But I get what you guys are saying.
@Daron_Fleming I get what you guys are saying. I get it man. That's not my mind set it's deeper. But preciate it. I value your opinion.
@Hort116 I get that my man. I'm wit you. I would need more time to explain. But I understand my brotha
@xBriasInterlude Hahaha. Your daughter is beautiful sista. It's all good.
@Bolts4Life4 Agreed!!

Top of the morning to you. Have a blessed day guys!! Positivity today please. Holla!!
Is Kevin Love for Demarcus Cousins trade really going down?
@dmschwart Yea I get you but I'm looking at the big picture of it needs to stop in general. You have valid points though.
@dmschwart Him being black makes it worse bc it's been a recurring thing. But the issue of the law killing innocent people is the big issue
@dmschwart No it's not. Bc if it happened to another race I would feel the same way. ITS WRONG!!
Don't make this a race thing. Right is right. Wrong is wrong. Bottom line!! And that wasn't right.
Unbelievable man. Complete non sense. I have family who are cops and no way shape or form can they tell me that was necessary #altonsterling

The Ultimate edition of Batman v Superman has an extended batman fight scene. That's one of the best fight scenes ever!! So dope!!
@chris_r1027 Yes sir!! That's the one I've been watching!!
Their take and version of Lex Luthor is starting to grow on me. Maybe I just like Jesse Eisenberg as an actor.
Ive watched Batman V Superman like 3 times in the past 2 days and I'm starting to like it more and more. I don't see why y'all say it's bad.
At least everything is edged up!! @ludacris #nowthatsludicrous https://t.co/1zU2H0ZahT

@streetstarnorbe @Jayblac1615 Might want in on this. He has the same philosophy as me. Our bet is locked in!! But how confident are you?
@PewterReport @FanSided Best thing they could do is give the rights to Marvel!! It's a life changing decision.

@HitsonRyan I never mentioned playing for that team did I!?! I said why not us. My team. So no it wasn't a misunderstanding. It was stupid.
@HitsonRyan People like you ruin it for everybody. Use your head!!
@HitsonRyan Its stuff like that that gets you blocked!! Unnecessary negative comments. And thats why its hard to interact with people online
@HitsonRyan Was this a smart thing to say. Im trying to be positive about the season and you say this non sense. Who cares. Its not about me
Why not us!?! https://t.co/jbcCDR9HNp
I'm kidding guys. Just having fun. I really don't care!! Trust me. Preciate the words though. Don't miss the real message though!!
Never mind I don't do any of those things bc I forgot I don't work hard!! Hahahaha. Good day to you guys!!

@813Heat Idk
@813Heat Boy what are you talking about. I'm talking about a single act. How he's playing now. Where you get that from? Who said that?
He's playing like what makes him Lebron instead of what people say he should be. Ball my brotha!!
I said before this game started Lebron would go for at least 40. He gonna easily get that. He FINALLY got that look in his eyes!!
@ChrisATLprayer Actually not a bad idea

@Alvern_1 @LavonteDavid54 @1prince_adjei Absolutely!! I've been talking about it for 3 weeks. Haha

@MJF_Realtor Preciate it buddy!! Still pulling for you guys
@1prince_adjei @Alvern_1 https://t.co/0taHm7dGxv
Its seem like the Warriors are playing better TEAM basketball. The Cavs have all the tools but too much Iso. Not enough ball movement
Ninja Turtles was just ok!! Not enough fighting for me. A lot of action but the fight scenes are what make them. It was funny though!!

@HitmanHolla Don't lose your money dogg. Rethink that bet.
@Caliking831 Shaq was ridiculous!! But he wasn't Lebron. Shaq easily is the most dominant figure to ever step foot on a court though!!
@CraccKicks He is the ultimate athlete yes!! But he also wasn't 6'8 250-260 moving and jumping the way Lebron does!!
@Caliking831 Both ridiculous athletes but what separates him is his size. 6'8 250-260.
Man please stop tweeting me about who was better than Lebron. I said athlete. I don't care about his game. I'm talking about as an athlete.
@CoryBennett1911 @JerryschmidtOU Hahaha definitely!!
Lebron athleticism is unfair!! Pure specimen!! Something we've never seen before!!
@Jachalp3 @okcthunder Yes sir!!
@1prince_adjei Why he get his toes cut off in episode 2 bruh!?! Sheesh!! This show moving extra fast!!
@Real_DealRaps Not at all!! It's over now. We're gonna win it!!
