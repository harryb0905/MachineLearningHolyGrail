Here's the audio version of @mattkatz00's take on @ChrisChristie's new book. Your choice: listen for 5 minutes or read 432 pages of what Matt more or less sums up this way: "He’s angry. So angry." https://t.co/UNiUKLejG3
The reporter who wrote the book on @ChrisChristie - literally - read Chris Christie’s book on Chris Christie ... and found it wanting. @WNYC https://t.co/mjgWKWUlvU

Per @WNYC newsroom via @BrianLehrer: Flights being held on ground at LaGuardia due to air traffic control staffing shortages in Atlanta and DC.
@PaulRinaldi What can you tell us about the ATC shortages that are halting incoming flights at LaGuardia, Newark and Philadelphia? @WNYC @Gothamist
Per @BrianLehrer: flights halted into LaGuardia, Newark and Philadelphia. Per me: wonder if this is an organized slowdown?
@ericuman @NJTurnpike @WNYC @Gothamist Passenger. Recording and tweeting at @BrianLehrer live on @WNYC https://t.co/WD6BzWSp4U
Per @BrianLehrer: EWR and Philadelphia also affected by air traffic controller shortages. @WNYC

“We’ve always focused on what our rights are; what’s just as important is looking at the other side - what our responsibilities are.” -  @Simas44 (here with @ValerieJarrett  explaining the purpose of @ObamaFoundation #TribFest18 https://t.co/foSlU8djod

The recurring chorus of #TribFest18, just now from @LupeValdez: “Texas is not a red state. It’s a non-voting state.” Hey New York and New Jersey: you’re not much better. @WNYC https://t.co/nWB7TEnml0
“Voting is the whole deal. If women do not vote, things will not change.” - @CecileRichards, saying Samantha Bee told her this week that half of her viewers aren’t even registered. What?!? #tribfest18
She adds: “Do more than what you thought was possible.” @CecileRichards cites the example of Lori @HawkinsforWI, a first time candidate for state Senate in Wisconsin.
Top advice from @CecileRichards to women interested in getting involved in politics today: “Don’t wait to be asked.” #TribFest18 @WNYC #USofAnxiety
Listening to @CecileRichards at #TribFest18 makes me think of this chart and the powerful stories my @WNYC colleagues are telling about women &amp; power on #USofAnxiety this fall.  https://t.co/mumOnPZOAh https://t.co/sNEIN48VxU

“What’s a Republican when you’ve got Bush, Trump and the Freedom Caucus?” - @KarlRove #TribFest18 https://t.co/d2M0rXEsjw

Former 45 Education Secretary @MargaretEdu Spellings (now head of @UNC) describes Judge Kavanaugh as a “victim of the process.” #tribfest18
“I don’t care of you’re a democrat or republican. Our country is being trashed by this.” - @KarlRove #TribFest18   Panel punctuated by shouts of “Garland” from the audience.
Former 45 communications director Dan Bartlett asks “who’s going to put their hat into the ring” after #KavanaughHearings? Notes Kavanaugh is his dear friend. #TribFest18
At #TribFest18 @KarlRove says “no White House can prepare” for a senator like @DianneFeinstein who is “prepared to sabotage a process like she did.” https://t.co/0PssVTYEvj

@MichaelAvenatti @jheil Gotta give @evanasmith and the amazing @TexasTribune team props for clairvoyance. @MichaelAvenatti today, @JeffFlake tomorrow at #TribFest18.
@MichaelAvenatti @jheil Avenatti says he’s worried that Senate Republicans will push forward for a floor vote without the promised FBI investigation. #kavanaugh

Can’t wait to hear @JeffFlake explain himself in Austin tomorrow at #TribFest18. @MichaelAvenatti is here this afternoon. Hoo-boy. @TexasTribune https://t.co/AUtczN9Guw
@s_nessen @NYCMayor @WNYC Thanks. Good to have local reporters like @WNYC’s @s_nessen who know their beats.
Asked why he’s not using his leverage to drive down @MTA construction costs (h/t to great @NYTMetro reporting), @NYCMayor says his appointees will get tougher “if we don’t see reform.”
JUST IN: @NYCMayor DeBlasio says he knows NYC straphangers are “pissed off” because he rides the subway “all the time” and hears from them. Fact check, @WNYC @s_nessen?
The mayor now encourages cities across America to consider rent control. Any Texas economists want to ring in?
“My biggest frustration- I have to call it a failure - is around homelessness.” @NYCMayor says he wasn’t forthright in confronting how homelessness had evolved from street people to an affordable housing crisis for families. Good @brianmrosenthal @nytimes question. #TribFest18
Both DNC Chair @TomPerez and @NYCMayor DeBlasio in Austin this morning have called for voting reform in NY state. It’s like the political world is roughly 2 years behind @brigidbergin of @WNYC.
...while @ndhapple live tweets for @nypost inside.

@dollyli Daughter @ArielaSchachter is Baker 09. Son @schachter_ben is two days into being Baker 22. They both have asserted that Baker is the best college @RiceUniversity (and Ben got his mom to defame Will Rice during an O-Week punking late last night).

It includes terrific photography by @WNYC's @ryeh (like the photo above) and @sugarpond, like this one of two Coop City neighbors who both lost their sons in gang violence. https://t.co/vIdksx6HO8
What does policing look like in NYC today? @mirelaiverac of @WNYC took a year to examine the NYPD's strategies for extinguishing gang violence. Today @NYMag published an oral history version of her reporting. https://t.co/Wenz1mJQyl
The @TexasTribune version: https://t.co/IrS61i9Bzo
And here’s what @neenareports describes as “the project where I really learned about storytelling” - about child sex trafficking, where the Narrative power comes not just from a great character but from the account of what happens to her. https://t.co/ARGFcm0qpB

Her @PeabodyAwards winning story (with @ProPublica), “Hell and High Water.” https://t.co/I3vcSQxkMD

What’s success? According to @dollyli “the most important part to me in making social video is how the internet responds.” This series “immediately for people to talk about their internalized racism.”
(Oh, here’s @laurenjyoung617 speaking.) https://t.co/9E7HbOf44P
One part from her project: https://t.co/EL2grBGvNA
Next, @dollyli @Goldthread2 shared an @ajplus video series on Chinese in the America South. Her goal: “how to take people’s expectations of this community and take fact-based reporting and challenge people’s assumptions.” https://t.co/K4HkdV933V

@edwardwasserman @bbabbo1 @NYDailyNews @Gothamist @WNYC This is not a tragedy. Or a surprise. It’s capitalism of an especially ugly kind. @kdoctor has done a fine job of following the @tronc money - out of journalism and into executives’ pockets. It’s getting to be an old and tiresome story.
@Azi @PatBailey518 @facebook @instagram @Twitter And yet... people who get public radio like @WNYC for free support it because they value the service and want to be part of something bigger than themselves. Other media cut and cut and then are surprised when users don’t see the value in a transactional relationship.
@evanasmith Plus it’s a bit of a cliche: Austin, Portland... What’s next, the Park Slope Tribune?
@alisonstewart This is why it’s so great being on the radio. Fewer things to worry about. @WNYC

@MsSchachter That’s how I interpreted this. https://t.co/p9gYDk19UV
I miss all the good stuff at work. Happy all this stuff to my @WNYC colleagues! https://t.co/Z1ZJ6qDOpf
One last attempt for today to attract interest from #NAHJ2018 for job opportunities at @WNYC. Tweet at me and we will be in touch. https://t.co/xSyc7s7VPE
@ByClaireMartin This seems so generic. Can I retweet it when appropriate?
Also, when you’re a reporter @WNYC, sometimes your stories get published in the @nytimes. (Like this one by @mattkatz00.)  https://t.co/SvWRcVXill
@evanasmith It’s #PrimeDay - I’m 59! Thanks @evanasmith
If you are at #nahj #nahj2018 #nahj18, you might especially want to listen to/see the quality of @WNYC reporting on immigration/Family separation. Like this: https://t.co/o3q4Ft2PBx
We are looking for radio producers, writers to report on NYC news, an investigative reporter who wants to learn audio. Tweet at me and let’s meet today. #NAHJ2018 #nahj #NAHJ18 https://t.co/YW27xRx2p4
@bethfertig https://t.co/rly3lCrQXw
Hi #nahj2018. Come work with @tanzinavega and other courageous journalists at @WNYC and @Gothamist. See me Friday in the Public Media Village or email me at jschachter@WNYC.org. And check out our #Aftereffect podcast - a Florida story about America today. https://t.co/um43w7VaAa
@chancetherapper: this is the other news from @WNYC today. Congratulations on @Chicagoist ! https://t.co/JUgJulg7RB
“There's a pain in Prodigy's voice that when you think about what NY street hip hop sounds like, to me, that is Prodigy's voice.” That pain was deep in his bones. Find out why in @WNYC’s #TheRealness. https://t.co/SggHcdlOEt
Hello @RuPaul. Would you check out @WNYC's version of #TheRealness? Our journalists talked to his family and friends, doctors and creative partners, about his life ... and his death last year from #sicklecelldisease. We'd be honored if you listened. https://t.co/SggHcdlOEt

LUNCHTIME LISTEN: One year after Prodigy's death, @WNYC @WNYCStudios present #TheRealness, the story of his life. He may have been the voice of New York, but P couldn’t escape a single recessive gene. https://t.co/SggHcdlOEt
@andrewhaeg: My colleague @rhyne would urgently like to talk with you about @groundsource. Can you email me best way(s) to reach you? jschachter@wnyc.org
Looking forward to meeting folks on Friday at #NAHJ18. I want to meet people who want to be investigative reporters for @WNYC, people who want to write about NYC for @gothamist, people who want to produce our talk shows. DM me! https://t.co/e5NMFcGZ2g
Watch the comments on this tweet for people of the media attempting to pun their way to glory @WNYC
Today’s cool news about local news: @chancetherapper acquires @Chicagoist from @WNYC as part of our @Gothamist project. Really! https://t.co/nnTyaI2Rg5
#sorrytobotheryou, but you really must read @WNYC’s  @rebel19’s take and listen to her conversation with @bootsriley at @Gothamist. https://t.co/ViJsv4EZza
This seems to be a habit that @tanzinavega is falling into... https://t.co/ZNvimnmkiA
@PJVogt What’s your favorite 🚠, @PJVogt? I am a longtime fan of the Palm Springs 🚠.
Heading out of the launch party for The Realness, new @wnyc @WNYCStudios podcast about Prodigy. Thanks to his family and friends for helping tell the story. Preview here and subscribe now before Epi 1 drops on Thursday. https://t.co/SggHcdlOEt https://t.co/2OCnaHSu7q
As he left the studio, @JimGaffigan walked into @WNYC’s afternoon news meeting. He compared us to @TMZ - favorably, we think.
Just saw the extremely funny @JimGaffigan in the @WNYC green room, about to talk with the extremely serious @mattkatz00 on @WNYCMidday. Tune in now. https://t.co/0b0JPoygM8
FYI he said this on #AskGovMurphy, a live call-in show broadcast by @WNYC @whyy @WBGO https://t.co/Ma7acQGTV0
@electionland https://t.co/qjzeouRmSL
@jelani9 But isn’t it fair to assume Mueller has those tax returns?
Starting her @FoxNews show, @IngrahamAngle says @realDonaldTrump uses “the hammer and sickle behind the scenes.” Which I think is exactly what the #Treason camp is saying!
@robinmenikoff @ChrisChristie @WNYC @whyy @GovAndrewCuomo He shook my hand and said he would do it. Months ago...
@theintercept @KatrinaNation @RepBarbaraLee @RoKhanna If you’ve never listened  to @Radiolab’s @PeabodyAwards winning episode on @RepBarbaraLee, you should. @WNYC https://t.co/59Nr9S1cEJ
@PreetBharara Is “collusion” the sole - even the right -  standard? @RadioFreeTom argued otherwise this week on @onthemedia. https://t.co/R2VcwERjob
@robinmenikoff The state of NJ under @ChrisChristie  sold its public media. @WNYC and @whyy acquired the radio stations. Something like 1/3rd of @WNYC’s members live in New Jersey. We are New Jersey Public Radio. https://t.co/BHW75Hbfyz
@AmolSinha @GovMurphy @WNYC @WBGO @whyy Thank you for listening and sharing.
Best line so far - Phil from Middletown, an artisanal weed guy, has an #AskGovMurphy question for @GovMurphy about “the budding cannabis industry.” @WNYC
@WBGO’s @dougdoyle just poses your question to @GovMurphy. https://t.co/M83YsX5p3D

@robinmenikoff @WNYC This show is a co-production of @WBGO @whyy and @WNYC from BGO’s Newark studio. WNYC and our New Jersey Public Radio stations proudly serve North and Central NJ. Our host @NancySolomon2 lives in Maplewood and has covered NJ for 15 years.

@JillAbramson @nytimes Not clairvoyant @WNYC, but in this case (thanks to @BrigidBergin) we were in the right place at the right time, a year ago.

@RonBrownstein @nealkwatra Just over 27,000 of ~214,000 registered Democrats voted in #ny14. So organizing definitely counts. Similar weak turnout across NY - though we have a system designed to discourage voting. https://t.co/B1jSWk5HLD
And here’s the @WNYC video. https://t.co/BNxm4dWu8B
Listening to @Ocasio2018 on @MorningEdition with @NPRinskeep? Here’s deep background on how she beat @repjoecrowley from @WNYC.  https://t.co/8FMtuqaw8k
@nycjim Couple of points: @Ocasio2018 won, not @SenSanders. Hardly anyone voted - so organizing (and voting!) matter. And @repjoecrowley represented archaic machine politics, as @brigidbergin explains for @WNYC. https://t.co/8FMtuqaw8k
Another NY story tonight: @Columbia alum @BenJealous wins the Democratic nomination for Maryland governor. @WNYC https://t.co/Wh3XJeuzkJ
@jmichaelkell On @WNYC this morning, @johnroconnor said to watch turnout in these competitive NY races as a gauge of how blue wavy the fall might be. Not so much?

@ggreenwald @brigidbergin @WNYC Also worth noting: 2016 data counted 214,000 registered Democrats in #NY14. @Ocasio2018 is  winning with fewer than 14,000 votes. Turns out your vote does count.  @WNYC

Inexplicably - rather, unforgivably - insulin costs are skyrocketing, and diabetics are dying. #Sugarland from @WNYC. https://t.co/y2rNZH8Mz4
In this @WNYCMidday interview @ChrisHayesTV @MSNBC cites Sealgate as evidence of a “culture of lawlessness” in @realDonaldTrump’s White House. https://t.co/Wf8gqlIrLe
JOURNALISM WITH IMPACT: The Trump Organization WON’T use golf tee markers exploiting the Presidential Seal after all - following @WNYC @ProPublica expose. https://t.co/xs2gFcJasA
Thanks @BeyondType1 for helping @WNYC spread this important information.  It is amazing - and kind of scary - how much most of us don't know about what we don't know about #diabetes. https://t.co/4aBwRfgqKH
When I posted this story on @Facebook, a bot (I suspect) instantly posted a link to a pirated copy of the Black Panther movie. Is there a lot of that going on? https://t.co/NZg2vlFRQK
Spend lunch with our @WNYC @onlyhuman #diabetes comic. Food for thought. https://t.co/n8QpqicmGM
@evanasmith You wish!
@georgegustines Thanks @georgegustines. Not exactly Insulin Man but good stuff.
@georgegustines https://t.co/n8QpqicmGM
Attention Twitter: This audio includes cat sound effects - meowing, that kind of thing. Also something described as a "roar." (Also a giggling @MorningEdition host.) I believe it is destined to go viral. @jimog &amp; @RScottHake for @WNYC https://t.co/E2BlmDKUWN
We’ve published our first comic book - and it’s deadly serious, about an epidemic of misdiagnoses of diabetes. #sugarland from @WNYC’s @onlyhuman. Share with someone you care about. https://t.co/wlVsWKh17q

And our NJ editor @NancySolomon2 reports for @WNYC that #Bridgegate operative (and convicted felon) David Wildstein is back blogging about New Jersey politics. https://t.co/8202tgtcYH
Meanwhile, our @WNYC @onlyhuman health team launched a week-long project whose premise is: just about everything you know about #diabetes is wrong. It's called Sugarland. (And yes - there's a quiz where you can test your level of knowledge/ignoranace.) https://t.co/kdv39psAJw
Next, a scoop: @WNYC and @ProPublica asked listeners to our #trumpincpodcast for evidence of unethical business conduct by @realdonaldtrump's family business. A whistleblower brought us this: https://t.co/UjoCn991BV

@Fahrenthold @ProPublica @realDonaldTrump What @Fahrenthold told @WNYC and @ProPublica: understanding @realDonaldTrump’s debt is his “personal project for this year.”   In particular, he wonders: what do you know about Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC?

@therealjimrich @ShaunKing @bethfertig @WNYC Consistently great work like @ShaunKing's that you highlight builds on a body of relentless digging by reporters all over this city. We stand on one another's shoulders.
@therealjimrich @ShaunKing Welcome back, @therealjimrich. I agree with the sentiment. @bethfertig broke this story last September for @WNYC. "Most people are still going to court because the Brooklyn DA only throws out about one out of every five low-level marijuana arrests." https://t.co/conv1Lvpyd
Is Brownsville proof that an NYC neighborhood can transform without gentrifiers pushing out its people? @yasmeenkhan reports for @WNYC https://t.co/yAkpdF82nK
For all you sneezy procrastinators in NYC, @WNYC’s Danny Lewis has done your flu-shot homework for you. https://t.co/dFEUu1iyYw
@AlecMacGillis Presumably @ChrisChristie whispered that one in his ear.
@AnnCoulter MS-13 doesn’t count? Give the poor guy a break.
@ndhapple But he just perked up.
@ByClaireMartin Last year there was a @JerrySeinfeld  rerun.
@ndhapple Raul Castro is nodding off.
@KBone0 This is why the auto industry has moved toward automation.
@danpfeiffer Did you watch the #Grammys? (If so, can you tell me when they’re over?)
@NJFrandino Canadian Bacon left him just one remove from Kevin. (Or was that John Candy?)

Has Long Island? https://t.co/t15W9SSvQb
Curious @Danjanison: Does @realDonaldTrump think he can get enough votes on Long Island to win his home state? @WNYC
@MsSchachter Sorry, that would be a rubberworker.
For @WNYC @GonzalezSarahA has done exceptional reporting on the Trump MS-13 crackdown on Long Island. Like this. https://t.co/qGYK2cmfUS
@OKnox Are there specifics about anything? Not that there needs to be.
@arunNYC @katehinds @StephenKing @WNYCMidday But @Shteyngart is posting BBQ recommendations.

@katehinds @arunNYC @StephenKing Hey don’t #sheldonshame your colleague! https://t.co/bfMf6OCukL
Is anyone in the House chamber taking a knee? #sotu
@katehinds Lotsa @StephenKing books on those shelves, my prying eyes see.
@Shteyngart Hmm. Did you have a guest at Rendezvous ... or two entrees?
You knew @POTUS would say “the state of our union is strong.” Do you agree? @WNYC
So far lots of talk about guns and climate in #sotu.
@SpeakerRyan  almost said he had the high privilege “of preventing” @realDonaldTrump
@tomzellerjr Beat me to it!
Awful lot of white men at this #sotu.
Just now @JamilSmith mentioned @RepBonnie’s highlighting of Recy Taylor tonight. Rep Coleman will be on Morning Edition on @WNYC tomorrow, reacting to the #sotu https://t.co/EBraFS5AP4

@dontclaimmytime @HillaryClinton @WNYC @BrianLehrer @SykesCharlie @joanwalsh @JamilSmith Sec. Clinton has been known to call into The @BrianLehrer Show - at least when she was Sen. Clinton. Our screeners would probably let her through tonight.
In case you don't wake up this evening and discover that @HillaryClinton has been president for the last year, turn on @WNYC at 8 ET to hear @BrianLehrer's #SOTU prep show w/@SykesCharlie @joanwalsh @JamilSmith. Then go back to bed. https://t.co/Sb5M0P0bo1

@samdolnick @nytimes But that’s just a misspelling of “Beyoncé.”
@VVFriedman Seriously, the cultural conversation is taking a pause tonight. No speeches, conventional sexual imagery and roles. Yet it’s the same corporations behind music as are behind movies, TV and the rest of media. Why?

My 17-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter just ran out of the house to a forum for local congressional candidates. How great is that?

A refugee who settled in New Jersey - Albert Einstein - helped found @theIRC during WWII. Now the IRC is settling refugees like Andre Twendele in NJ. Hear that story today @WNYC.

What we learn in today’s episode of @WNYC’s #unsettledstory: - more refugees in the last decade have come from Dem Rep Congo than anywhere - the Congolese are Christians - Pres Trump’s policies inexplicably block their resettlement. https://t.co/CZpwUVMLKh
See you are tweeting this am, @NPRinskeep. Perhaps share this? #UnsettledStory @WNYC https://t.co/5OoorcYzEL

@jamifloyd @WNYC And if you weren’t, too!
@mattkatz00 @nytimes @WNYC One striking thing I learned: Andre lives on the same street in Elizabeth NJ where Jared Kushner’s grandparents first lived as refugees from Nazi Germany. For my mom, that street was Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. What about your family?
Have you seen @mattkatz00’s story about Andre and Lisette in The NY Times or on @nytimes dot com? Now listen to his incredible audio documentary version from @wnyc. Or just ... listen. #UnsettledStory https://t.co/CZpwUVMLKh
#unsettledstory is a love story about Andre and Lisette, refugees from Congo who now are separated by an ocean thanks to America's tangled refugee policies. @mattkatz00 traveled from Elizabeth NJ to Malawi to report it for @WNYC, @nytimes  and @NewsHour. https://t.co/umGrFzHIfh

@karaswisher When I was a reporter covering courts in Jacksonville and Kansas City, prisoners used to send me ALL CAPS-filled letters handwritten on legal pads claiming their innocence.
@lpolgreen @BretStephensNYT Pretty sure that Tarnogold, my mother’s parents’ shtetl in Poland, translates to “shithole.” Mom used to summer there as a child ... which is why she preferred Palm Springs and Laguna as an adult.

@brianstelter @WNYC @BrianLehrer On @TheTakeaway, @toddzwillich gave listeners a warning and then quoted the President's reported comment: https://t.co/1Y6Emg2cdO
@brianstelter @WNYC Working this way, my @WNYC colleagues have made sound judgments this morning. @BrianLehrer did not use the President's language: https://t.co/QbiUrD4JHx
@brianstelter @WNYC We’re deciding on a case by case, program by program basis, in consultation with our counsel.
@mikiebarb You probably weighed the second consideration in some form as you put together tomorrow’s podcast, @mikiebarb; you have the good fortune not to have to weigh the first.
@mikiebarb On another level, audio differs from text. People sit in their cars or at their breakfast or worktables, or with their buds in their ears, and unless we offer a warning, they don’t know what’s coming. You can’t scan live audio before it airs.
@mikiebarb There is a genuine debate. On one level, how concerned to be - as a licensed broadcaster - about using a derivative of the seven banned FCC words.
I’m thinking we’ll see Norwegian Wood in the tabs tomorrow. Can you confirm @brianstelter @TweetBenMax @mlcalderone?
@bethfertig I endorse @bethfertig’s entreaty, in all circumstances.
Is @TomWheelerFCC on @Twitter tonight? Or @AjitPaiFCC? https://t.co/zwvy2tEg9T
@Kyrouz @WNYC Ring the bell. 🛎 This is exactly the guidance I’ve provided the @WNYC staff.

So the question, possibly, is whether the city that never sleeps oughta give its subway a rest. @beenishfahmed for @wnyc. https://t.co/B6nq64XV2e

These guys know how to do Sunday. https://t.co/eM3vt77sbM
@KyleWMassey Just to say you can find all of @WNYC’s coverage of itself here. My respect for our journalists is enormous; they are doing a terrific job on a tough assignment.  https://t.co/9MotQNCnRQ
I’m asking for 50 minutes of your time. Listen to a special @onthemedia reported from #PuertoRico by @AlanaLlama. Like the best journalism it cuts through lies, distortions &amp; misperceptions to point toward important truths. https://t.co/BUNcP9WUde
Never expect @rebel19 to have a darth of feelings. Can’t wait! https://t.co/E3OOn6YjYU
Behind the scenes @onthemedia as @AlanaLlama and technical director Jen Munson put final touches on this week’s special hour on #PuertoRico. Listen a little later @WNYC  93.9 FM or here: https://t.co/Hxqy9UMmrs https://t.co/JDrOasaYV3
The new norm in #PuertoRico: resilience, or resignation? @AlanaLlama says the word people are using is acostumbrados. It’s not good, she reports for @wnyc. https://t.co/nA0wArVbjy

@marysdesk @audreyqq Obs. https://t.co/Gd8g5nnsCt
@cvaldaisnotbig @nytimes @FiveThirtyEight @Sulliview @verizon @Apple Yes, but... A table is very different from that gauge. Remember election night in 2016?
@Sulliview @nytimes @FiveThirtyEight Good for everyone's blood pressure, bad for sales of beta-blockers.
@marysdesk @audreyqq Gimme a break, @marysdesk !
@cvaldaisnotbig @nytimes @FiveThirtyEight @Sulliview If that's so, either my wifi or my MacBook Air is failing me. Shall we blame @verizon or @Apple? Or, by default, the patriarchy?

@rebel19 @realDonaldTrump 😜
@rebel19 Perhaps this is what @realDonaldTrump is up to in crushing blue states. I mean, everyone says the GOP tax plan going to lower housing prices in NYC.
@chreliot @ilyamarritz I suspect it may have been his hardest. And @ilyamarritz made everyone @WNYC proud. Me especially.
@ilyamarritz Except that the ads celebrate people like @BrianLehrer and the people of @WNYC who report and entertain and spur curiosity. New Yorkers are smart enough to differentiate.
And I’m grateful all these people brought @rararahima to @WNYC. https://t.co/zakGi7HKA4

@jeannem13610507 @BrianLehrer @KUNMnews @WNYC @lwalker I'm going to make a donation right now to @KUNMnews in your honor. I don't know what you gave @WNYC but I hope you'll accept this as a fair deal and keep listening to both stations.
@jeannem13610507 @BrianLehrer @KUNMnews @WNYC And thank you for supporting @WNYC. We are hard at work trying to merit your trust.
@jeannem13610507 @BrianLehrer @KUNMnews @WNYC It is not too late: https://t.co/0xDk8LS5rN
“I deeply regret that this happened on my watch and I take responsibility and I pledge that we will do better” - closing words from @lwalker to @BrianLehrer on @WNYC
“We have to do a better job of supporting people who come forward,” says @lwalker. Says she was a victim of sexual harassment and didn’t come forward.
“We need to do better” - @lwalker to @BrianLehrer on @WNYC
@WNYC will look to bring in more people of color in editorial leadership, in hosting of @TheTakeaway, @lwalker pledges.
When @BrianLehrer asks about the replacement of 3 African-American cohosts, @lwalker says she “regrets” their treatment, says @WNYC has and will continue to champion diversity.
Now @lwalker says she has apologized to the women who were harmed by John Hockenberry’s conduct - and does it again.
My respect for @BrianLehrer grows by the second. Imagine grilling your boss of 20 + years on live radio.
“Every single complaint we got we did an investigation and took action” - @lwalker
“We are revisiting everything,” @lwalker says in tense conversation with @WNYC’s @BrianLehrer.
She says this all “happened on my watch and I take responsibility” for what happened.
According to @lwalker she learned about some of the allegations for the first time from @TheCut reporting.
“I knew about some of the behavior...” including @sukisworld’s complaints. Which were investigated - and led to action by @WNYC
She says Hockenberry “was not fired for sexual misconduct. His contract was not renewed for a variety of reasons.”
First @lwalker says there are limits to what can be said about confidential personnel matters.
@WNYC @lwalker @BrianLehrer @TheTakeaway  https://t.co/rpH9dT5Yp6

Reporting by @WNYC’s @GonzalezSarahA about judges calling BS on law enforcement profiling of Latino teens is so good that @NPR shared it nationally on @MorningEdition. https://t.co/tywDCGurj4
@NirajC thank YOU.
As NYC decides what to do about historical statues, @WNYC’s @JenniferVanasco examines the history of all those tributes to Christopher Columbus. https://t.co/EeoQ1KBRr5

@NirajC: Please note that Rebecca Carroll's title at WNYC is "editor,  special projects." It is wrong on our website, right on LinkedIn. Hope you can fix it in your article. Email me if you have questions: jschachter@wnyc.org
@pritharaysircar Thank you. Lots of work to be done. Listening to one another, hearing from our audience, speaking plainly are all meaningful pieces of how we move ahead @WNYC.

@joanwalsh So, @joanwalsh’s worst: the “Republican judicial power grab.” Ironically, that’s the thing that Republicans point to (even holding their noses) as @realDonaldTrump’s greatest accomplishment.

So far tonight @WNYC gala: two shout-outs to MLK Jr., one each to @brigidbergin (for coverage of the Brooklyn voter purge) and #wethecommuters.
