‚Äú@espn: @espn Here is Mel's mock draft in full: http://t.co/XGe7wlOlpE‚Äù Are you serious Mel?
Just counted 17 inline skaters who have changed sports and qualified for the US Olympic Speedskating team on ice.  Incredible! #inlineracing
@jrmantia I guess I'll be living til 100 with a great personality!
Just my opinion but you put inline Speedskating in the Olympic eye and they wouldn't be able to take their eyes off of it. #inlineracing
God is great my friends!
Met my daughters teacher at her school. Here's what my daughter thinks I do for a living: #baller http://t.co/gDrDSSiaxP
@adri_alonso7 I'll do my best. All I can do is give back!  Thank you.
Perfect start to a great day. I think something special is about to happen!
God doesn't give us what we can't handle, He helps us handle what we are given.
@NotCoachOBrien Not with the first pick you won't!
@WeRollHard @ESPN_Colin Yes she did and she is an incredible athlete.
@ESPN_Colin That's the life of an Olympian. Train 4 yrs and in most cases your whole life for that 1 special moment. #chasedreams
@HeadStrongDoc love it!
Expected way more from @Jaboowins   (Jameis Winston) last night. Got the "W" though. That's all that counts at the end of the day
@BruceBeck4NY Bruce hope your new year is going well. Any ideas in the best way to get NFL Draft tickets for this May there in NYC?
@HeadStrongDoc Back atcha!  How are you?  Going to Sochi?  How's the family?
It's time we have an inline skate designed by a skater not a manufacturer. #HEDRICKSKATE #DOUBLEPUSH
First meeting on Friday to discuss starting my own skate brand. Pretty pumped that I have the chance to give back to my sport. #inlineracing
Wake up Seminoles.  This is getting nasty!
@Mschmidty99 don't shave it!
@marktuitert I feel so far away from the sport in just 4 shorts years. How's life away from the ice?  My little girls are 3 and 4 now.
@marktuitert Doing great Mark!  Started a new career in the oil and gas industry. Best of luck in Sochi #dutchspeedskating #Sochi2014
What's going on in Nederlands?  Who is skating well?  How was Olympic trials? #Sochi2014
@hlynnrichardson great job last weekend!  It's great to see all of you living your dreams.  #Sochi2014 #inlineracing
Good morning!  If you fathers out there haven't watched "Courageous" get it. What an eye opener. Every kid deserves a great dad!
@TheJessicaSmith Please support our Olympic hopeful so her family can see her live her dreams. #goingforgold
@TheJessicaSmith Congrats on a great weekend!  Keep it up!
@ChesterPitts Ready to make 2014 my best year yet!  You better be polishing up on your Speedskating skills! #chestercantskate lol
@AubreeKeck That's cool. I am officially old. That was 8 years ago next month. How are you? Tell your family hello!
@ChesterPitts What's up Chester?  Hope 2014 is treating you well so far.
@vicci_king the sport needs change and a breath of fresh air.  It's time to give back!  #chadisback inline racing
@jansentim skaters have been skating in skates designed by manufacturers rather than experts. Time for a change.
Skate brands have made changes each year without understanding the evolution of the sport or the right technique. #timeforchange
Skated on the modern day inline skate and I was very disappointed. May be time to design  my own skate soon. #inline #doublepush
@Mschmidty99 Joke. Hope you're having a great weekend!
@Mschmidty99 Buckees took it on the chin last night lol
@JJWatt Fresh start JJ!  Time to bounce back. Houston is behind you!
@sonofbum @AdamSchefter Nice job Wade!  You're a class act. I wish you all the best.

In Sacramento for the day to speak- praying now that my story today can impact a few lives here in Cali!
So grateful that God is allowing me to share my little story to inspire people one day at a time!

@ashleyQUIZ back atcha!
When it comes to dealing with people; always try your heartest.
Leaders are givers and takers: givers of credit and takers of responsibility and blame.
Few things feel as good as trying your absolute hardest at something worthy.
@RyanOBedford Good teams win the close ones. 10-1 now thanks to those Detroit Lions. Cashiers check will be fine!
http://t.co/XvqV79Rn
Check out the new leadership group I joined last month. http://t.co/XvqV79Rn.

@Mschmidty99 get used to it Obama is going to put plenty out of business. Hope your day gets better. See you soon bil!
@vicci_king hedrickchad@gmail.com
The problem with our country is we have too many followers and not enough leaders.
@vicci_king what's up?
We've lost sight of the Word Of God in this country. It's to learn and understand what "One Nation Under God" means again.
@sonofbum love it Wade!  Put Cutler on his butt!
You guys better watch Andrew Luck!  Remember when Peyton started 1-15 in  Indy rookie year?  Just sayin'
@espn a golf ball dropping in the hole!
@JJWatt I want to see Cutler on the ground on Sunday night!  I love the passion you have for the game and the city. You play the game right!
@idaveenstra Lets talk about it in 2016. Our economy is now a business and Romney is a proven business leader!
It's now up to all of us to be leaders for this country! We all know what to expect for the next 4 years. The same exact thing.
This country needs to be ran by a businessman now. Vote Mitt Romney and lets make a change now!
@dmorey I'd like to have the chance to meet you over lunch soon.  Do you have any time over the next few weeks?
Life is a gift from God- what a shame it would be to give it back unopened.

Looking forward to an exciting weekend with my little girls while my wife's out of town.  Movies, pizza, and ice cream.

Happy birthday Bum!  I hope to see you at a game this year!

@F_Wieringa nice one haha!!!!!
Good morning or afternoon depending on where you may live. I'm headed to the chiropractor after waking up with a stiff neck. Great start!!!
What good is it of you win all the money in the world, but forfeit your soul?
Ok guys I keep getting requests to see the kids. Here they are Hadley and Harper Hedrick! http://t.co/Be4gA6Fc
That's 500 I guess I'm coming to visit. Hope everyone had/ has a great weekend!
Great day of fishing with my boys!  Pics coming soon.
You Dutch love to tweet!  Maybe you're right 500 may be too easy. My wife and I can't wait to come visit all of you.
Heading out to bay fish at 5 am on my third cup of coffee already!  Pictures coming.
Thanks to the men and women who fight for our freedom!  Hope all of you enjoy this special day.  Go USA!!!!!
@Jeroen_Pouw what is the date?
Alright Holland we're getting close to 500. You're awesome!!! I miss all the special friendships I developed thre and of course the fans.
@roechama I'll be in my way soon!  We're almost to 500 in 1 day. Wow!!!!!
@JoostvDieren Patrick Quinn is my manager- qsports@yahoo.com. Contact him for me to visit.
@JoostvDieren I'd love to set up a tour of several churches when I come. I give my testimony often here in the states.
Good morning guys!  Big day today. 2 pm interview that could launch a new career for myself.  Exciting!!! Life is nothing without goals!
@AnnetteGerrit I feel so far away from the Speedskating world. Had a great experience but it was time to leave. How are you skating?
@JaminTony5 actually meeting got pushed to tomorrow at 2. Thanks for asking!
@AnnetteGerrit hello stranger!  How are you?  I come to Holland when 500 Dutch people ask me to. Why don't you post for them to follow me.
@RenskeWinters perfect!
@geertplender email Patrick Quinn at qsports@yahoo.com. He's my manager and would love set up a tour there in Holland. Thank you!
Beautiful day here in Texas 62 and sunny!  No offense to the places I've traveled, but winter without snow is great for this Texas boy!
@rinsekloek what is the name of your church?  I'd love to do a tour in Holland  visiting different churches giving my testimony. God bless!
@willemde3e I hope to see you soon. I'll come to visit the people not just to watch Speedskating.
Huge response from the Dutch. I guess I'll have to come across the Atlantic soon. Need 500 I need 300 more. Not bad in 3 hours.
@RenskeWinters what's your idea?
@Mschmidty99 it's going to get better who knows maybe Lady Gaga will be playing on the way home. Haha
Ok Dutch people. Here's the deal if I get a tweet from 500 of you before December my family and I come to Holland. In counting too!
@sportsagentCSEP how did it go last night?
@JThompsonhair  what's up Jake?  I hope your doing well bro. Lynsey and I are back in Houston raising the kids. I wish you the best!

Haircut before an interview tomorrow that could change my life!  Prayers welcome. Just following God's path.
@tonymuse you may be right!  Thanks for the wisdom!
@tonymuse I gotcha Tony!  So far in the corporate world the drive and desire we have to be the best is unmatched around me.
It's so tough for an athlete to find a new career that stimulates them the same way as their sport did.
My Houston Texans are getting a little momentum..... Just sayin!
That was a depressing footbal gamel. 9-6 is that even considered entertainment?
After a great night out last night I'm just hanging with my girls watching football. Texans game tomorrow with my wife!
Great day today!  Days like today make you realize how blessed I am and how important it is for people to help those less fortunate.

Following Gods path- can't wait to see what's in store for my family and I.
Full day today-  leaving for Berlin tomorrow.  Just getting the bags packed and then off to dinner and to watch an 80's cover band!  God bls
Training followed by 1 hour in front of the camera for Nike.  Maybe they'll have some new gear for me.
Great morning of training now I'm just trying to get ready for the trip- sometimes there's just not enough time to get everything done!
Heading off to Berlin, Amsterdam, and Oslo for the fall World Cups on Friday.  Gods blessings continue and I'm undeserving!
4 months until I'm back in Houston full time.  No more snow thank goodness!
Just getting the day started after sleeping late.  Off to the grocery store while washing clothes to get ready for the next trip on Friday!
Back in Utah without my girls!  Taking it easy tomorrow as I get ready to head to Europe on Friday!
I'm burnt out on skating I need to slide away for some personal "me" time.
I'm so lucky to have such great fans all across the world!!  I read every one of your messages!
Getting out of bed after a tough long week of racing.  Great racing and congrats to Shani, Trevor and the youngsters on a great week!
