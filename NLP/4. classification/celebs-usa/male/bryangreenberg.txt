@ANDREWTI Yo is that racist?
I don't want to hear that Rachel Mitchell failed as a cross examiner. When 11 republican men, who were too scared of the optics, hired her so they could cower behind her to question Dr Ford.
Even Fox News is saying Ford is believable.
It’s a shame the FBI didn’t investigate this allegation. But Ford appears to be credible and I thank her for her courage. She is a brave American.

I apologize for calling suicide a  “mistake” in my post. I understand that in dark days it feels like you don’t have a choice. Try and find the strength and know that things will get better. It’s ok to open up to someone about your feelings You don’t have to keep it inside❤️
It's crazy how the loss of someone you never met can hit you so hard.
Shocked to hear of @anthonybourdain passing. I never met him but shared the same spirit and adventure for traveling. What a huge loss. If you’re having suicidal thoughts don’t make the same mistake.

Not a fan of Comey. But he was investigating Trump and his ties to Russia. This makes Trump look even more suspect.

Getting off Twitter now before #GameofThrones is spoiled.
2017 @nyknicks is all that matters
Congrats to David Blatt and Varejao on their rings.
Much respect to Golden State. I don't care if they didn't win the championship. That regular season record still counts for a lot.
James Jones brought Cleveland a championship.
Lebron has nothing left to prove. Congrats Cleveland. #NBAFinals
Kyrie making up for sitting out last year. #nbafinals2016
Love Lebron and Steph talking shit. #NBAFinals
Warr-io-ors came out to pla-ay. #NBAFinals
Game 7. My prediction the refs won't call anything. Lebron can be a bully in the paint. Cavs win. But I dunno. Hope it's not a blowout.
Life is so random and sad sometimes. #RIPAntonYelchin
Just want to wish a special happy Father's Day to all of those Dads not on social media.
