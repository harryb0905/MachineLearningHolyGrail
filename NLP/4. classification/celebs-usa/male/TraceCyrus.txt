I kept quiet when they talked bad on me. But I can't put up with someone I know personally talking bad on my lil sis. Miley is a queen.
Be careful getting into the music industry. U will meet artists u look up to &amp; love then realize they aren't good people. They just fooled u
It makes me sad seeing bands I love and have supported for years talking bad about myself and my sister. Miley and myself only spread love
I listened to them since I was 15. First CD I bought when I moved to California.. They talked shit on me too.. Regardless I LOVE PATD music
Then they do an interview about their band and just talk shit about my little sister Miley????
Just like Panic at the Disco that I grew up loving! Inspired me to start a band and I toured with them! Thought it was all love
Sad how fake this industry is..

I've never felt jealousy towards another person. When I see others who are making a lot of money and being successful it inspires me!!
Most people want to be accepted and liked by everyone... I'm happy being an outcast. I wasn't made to be loved by everyone.

I'll do another contest next weekend and give out more free SMHP clothing
@MrsMxtro I'll get u also. DM address and shirt size
The correct answer is Danger Radio! A great band! if u haven't heard of them u should check them out
@emocobra666 yes!!!! Send address and shirt size to my DM
@Fordear_Jessica yup lol
None of u r even really close on first metro station tour. If someone doesn't guess it in next 5 minutes in going to just tell u guys
@EsteBangarang FTSK is close but there was a band we toured with for 2 weeks before that on the east coast!
@a_onlym that was the second! Close tho
Aright last contest of the day to win a free SMHP shirt. What was the first band Metro Station went on tour with? This is a tricky one
Alright guys someone won the first contest! The first Metro song was "The love that left u to die" that doesn't sound emo at all right? Lol
@knewbro u got it!!!! DM me your address and shirt size!
@MyDigitalMariah close! But that still wasn't the first! ♥️
@MichiganSMILER no but that is another classic and one of my favs!
@KellsiRae nope but good guess!
Who knows the name of the first Metro Station song Mason and I ever released? First right answer gets a free shirt from my clothing line!
