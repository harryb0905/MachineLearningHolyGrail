@rlytle SO sad and SO true.
How can the steelers run the ball with their 3rd and 4th string and we can't run it with two starters? Pathetic. Let's go! #WhoDey #Bengals
I don't know how you're supposed to tackle a WR over the middle anymore. What a joke! #Bengals #WhoDey
You can't ask AJ to carry this offense. We HAVE to be able to run the football. Come on #Bengals #WhoDey
Whodey, Whodey, #WhoDey think gonna beat them #Bengals
It's game day Cincy!! #WhoDey
On this date one year ago, I was blessed with the most beautiful baby girl any dad could dream of. Happy 1st Birthday Brooklyn!

@ArsenioHall .......Really?!!
@jillhite @EiferTy85 Touché! That had more to do withe ND thing than anything.
Loser has to post pic in the winner's jersey. #youin? https://t.co/PJeDlakR3b
@soldiernick09 Good, thanks, buddy'
@ArsenioHall Wanna bet?
Let's go #Bengals #WhoDey
@DreamerDawg Bengals!!!!!
On to something EVERY Ohioan can agree on.....BIG game tonight...Bengals/Browns. Let's get it done fellas!! #WhoDey #Bengals
Anyone who truly knows me knows my unconditional love for the state of Ohio. Disappointing to see some of you question that today.
@raditts well played.....
While I may not agree, the people of Ohio have spoken and that's the way it's supposed to work. Change takes time. #democracy #respect
Hope you’re heading to the polls this tomorrow! If you’re in #Ohio and want to end marijuana prohibition: #NoOn2 #YesOn3. @Yeson3Ohio
@Razor1579 fair enough....
Big win in Pitt for my #Bengals today!! Never an easy place to play. Congrats fellas!! #WhoDey #undefeated
@Learntobesafe So, you support the prohibition of alcohol too? That is the only way your arguement makes sense...... #YESon3
@Learntobesafe When they are 21, I trust them to make their own responsible decisions, just as I do with drinking. #YesOn3
@Learntobesafe It's a business venture, sure, but I would never put a dollar into something I didn't believe was right, especially in Ohio.
@Learntobesafe Keep reaching buddy. Just because things are legal doesn't mean you "allow" your kids to do them. Like alcohol, 21+ #YESon3
@DrPhelady @Learntobesafe Agreed! Completely inappropriate, but sadly predictable.
@katiedod Actually, the only reason I put money up is because I believe this is the best thing for Ohio. #YesOn3
@Learntobesafe Being a proponent of #issue3 does not make you a bad parent buddy. Alcohol is legal, would you let your kids drink? #YesOn3
Hope you’re heading to the polls this Tuesday! If you’re in #Ohio and want to end marijuana prohibition: #NoOn2 #YesOn3. @Yeson3Ohio
@Missjen325 @NBCTruthBeTold @VanessaLachey Bring it on!! #TruthBeTold
@sarahaines @Barbie @GMA Pretty sick! My only question, does Ken not have Twitter? No love from him?
Had a great time today playing Ken opposite the Barbie of @sarahaines #gmahalloween https://t.co/udwAcuxviQ
@NickFanatic_com when did you move to FL?
Heading to NYC to co host @GMA tomorrow morning for the big Halloween show. Can't wait to see what kind of costumes they come up with!
No matter what, so happy for @JohnnyCueto and his success! All the best my brother! #WorldSeries
Well, this is a hell of a way to kick off the #WorldSeries tonight!! There might not be any pitchers left. Great game!
What we didn't see in Colorado, with legalization in full swing https://t.co/6BfrxHh9XL via @enquirer
Can we go ahead and end this game at half? #trojans #FightOn
Looking for something fun to do tonight? #TruthBeTold you need to watch @nbc at 8:30ET, 7:30CT
@wmscogop Totally disagree with you and your math.....and that's fine. The beauty of democracy.
@wmscogop The taxation on legalized marijuana certainly benefit many more than just a few, including local governments.
@wmscogop I wouldn't attach my name to anything I didn't believe in, no matter how much money is involved. Sorry you don't agree.
Teamed up with @LAYS #DoUsAFlavor to announce #VoteBiscuits as the winner! https://t.co/FD1rnyG0lU
How 'bout them #Bengals ya'll? Another Sunday, another W! #WhoDey

@reaperpestmanag @nfl not a packers fan buddy....
@1965EPerez @nfl YES!! I'm not a Packer fan saying that, I'm a football fan. Both teams deserve the ball in OT..... #NFLPlayoffs
That said, no way Green Bay should EVER lose that game. Crazy, crazy, crazy..... #NFLPlayoffs
The @nfl has to change the overtime rules. With the SB on the line, Green Bay should at least have the chance to answer there. #NFLPlayoffs
@Chefbriduff @DrewLachey @LacheysBar @ShareThis @JottieB @JillsFork well done sir!!

@yrfanalways The only thing I'm hateful about are idiots on Twitter talking about things they can't possibly understand!! Yes, you....
@Glowboyd I think it's a terrible rule that should be changed, but the correct call based on that rule. Shame it came down to that....

Thanks to all who have been down to @LacheysBar so far. Sorry I haven't been there, but having a daughter trumps ALL!! #Lacheys
@Gaaangs yeah, I'm talking second half.
@Gaaangs how many times were they putting up bad shots as the shot clock hit :01?
Our #Bearcats have to find some kind of consistent offense. Tough to beat good teams with defense alone!
@pauldehnerjr @LacheysBar @rhinehausotr Party foul. Will never happen again!!!
Honor the memory of Chris Kyle, a true hero and friend, by attending a preview screening of #AmericanSniper on 1/14. http://t.co/Yknhk9285v

Bengal fans, if you need to drown your sorrows, may I suggest several cold ones at  @LacheysBar this afternoon. #groundhogday #Bengals
I hope @VanessaLachey can deliver better than the @Bengals offense is today!! #Bengals #WhoDey
@monicamariekenn Maybe....
Our offense makes the colts look like the '85 Bears. Come on!! #Bengals
@Lesnar5150 go Rainiers!!
@othgivesmehope happy birthday.
@codiki Here's hoping!!
@codiki gotta be aggressive and trust your Qb to not make a stupid play. Can't play scared.
There we go..... #WhoDey
@codiki it's the playoffs, we can't play scared. You have to be aggressive, no?
Why are the bengals not in a hurry up offense? Do we even want to win? #Bengals
It's now or never Bengals! Let's start a new chapter and bring home a big W from Indy. You gotta believe!! #WhoDey #Bengals
Sports fans everywhere should be mourning the passing of @StuartScott today. He was truly an undeniable, one of a kind presence. #RIP #ESPN
@IAmRobLewis @thedrewlachey Thank you brother!! You gotta come sometime....
@JenniferElm @LacheysBar Soon, you will be able to get them online.

Game time for the #Bearcats and what better place to watch it than at @LacheysBar with a cold one in your hand?! #Lacheys
@jmlinn25 @LacheysBar You never know......
This is why a college playoff is a must!! You never know until you play the game....4 seed beats a 1! Great way to kick off @LacheysBar
Is there a mercy rule in college football? Wow, this is rough! #RoseBowl
@ndm717 Does a bear sh*t in the woods? #Lacheys
What a comeback for Michigan State in the Cotton Bowl! Gotta love New Years Day college football.

What a game!! Congrats to #FSU on ending the SEC reign of terror over college football. Next year, it's time for playoffs!! #BCS
Who you guys got tonight, Auburn or FSU? Hoping for a great game either way, but feel like Auburn has destiny on their side!! #BCS
The #reds and #bengals feel like the same team to me anymore. So much talent and potential that ends in utter disappointment year after year
Well, that sucked!! As much as it pains me to say, congrats to the #chargers You won the one that counted.
You can't turn the ball over like this. Recipe for losing....... #WHODEY
