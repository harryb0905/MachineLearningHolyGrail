@themouthmatusow Young? He’s pushing 40. It’s not like he’s 14 and didn’t know any better. And the help he needs is in a prison cell. How much police time did he waste? I can’t get the police to my house when I’ve had 4 break ins. Fuck that idiot.
@Mattkadian @Samuraihonor As far as the muscles around the break I’m supposed to move around to avoid atrophy.

@realdavidkopp @Angry_Polak David it was a legal .38 special. The toxicology report makes no mention of alcohol. Just coke and pcp.
Another satisfied customer https://t.co/l8I96s0r1v
@Streeter6Lisa @Angry_Polak That’s what they claim.
@realdavidkopp @Angry_Polak David this isn’t really accurate but changes nothing of what I said. The Father was getting aggressive with the Mother. Marvin warned his Father then assaulted him. The Father shot the son several minutes later. Neither were drunk. Marvin had traces of coke and pcp in his system.
@JHOBBS1919 Dunno
@JHOBBS1919 I hope not
@DJFenton217 @burrrrrberry Ok ty
@Dark_Knight_17 @burrrrrberry Implying I shouldn’t be writing chapters in poker books?
@Angry_Polak Once it was removed his behavior returned to normal. Physiatrist deemed him harmless. Now does he stay in jail for life???
@Angry_Polak I read a book that specially dealt with this. Marvin Gay’s Father murdered him. He was evaluated and a cat scan was ordered because of his erratic behavior. A brain tumor was detected pressing on the amygdala, the area of the brain that controls anger and aggression...
@DJFenton217 @burrrrrberry Irony? Nice train of thought. The book is to help the person who bought the book. Not the one getting chastised. Nice try though. And yes u r probably the only one who couldn’t figure that out.
@burrrrrberry I preach this all the time. Seems like no one listens. I even closed my chapter in Super System 2 with this subject.
@JHOBBS1919 @TexDolly Ya he got banned and then probably made the other.
@Kevinmthoughts @RyanFeePoker @JayFarber @shaundeeb Thank you for imbited me
@ChasLeek @DC_Rob Did I say they weren’t? I guess ur too stupid to know.
@DarinWrisley @DC_Rob Interesting. Defiantly possible.

@mike_carreiro @realCarreiro @GarlandHammer And again. What version of events? Have u ever thought about buying something and decided not to? Or the price went up so you didn’t?
@mike_carreiro @realCarreiro @GarlandHammer Unsolicited?  And I already answered his lawyer told him to let him handle all the talking from that point forward.
@mike_carreiro @realCarreiro @GarlandHammer There is no side. He made a comment and the stock went up and came down. He didn’t buy or sell any stock. Neither did anyone close to him. What else is there?????
@mike_carreiro @realCarreiro @GarlandHammer What side?  What do u not understand?
@mike_carreiro @realCarreiro @GarlandHammer And?
@DougPolkPoker The Carlos memes never get old.
@realCarreiro @GarlandHammer That’s what u do when u have something to hide? Go against advice of your attorney? Ur a real idiot. What side? It’s a simple story. If u can see that then u r a simpleton. U don’t survive a full investigation from 2 Fed agencies if ur guilty. I’m done with u
@realCarreiro @GarlandHammer He went silent on advice from his attorneys. That’s what u do when under investigation
@Dolfan99_34 No. Most logical explanation I can come up with is it was a final good will gesture from Batista to a man who paid him millions.
@rackedUp1620 @RizzoPoker @phil_hellmuth @TexDolly You little bitch. I beg you to come say this to my face. But we both know you never will don’t we? You coward loser!!
@rackedUp1620 @ChasLeek @phil_hellmuth @TexDolly Are you too stupid to understand we have children in our Family that need to be supported as well??? Not to mention the other enormous medical bills he has to pay daily for members of our Family. But I guess u think u are owed this explanation?   Fuck you asshole! How bo dat?
And we’re off. Played @TheScottyNguyen chips while he went to the bathroom, won two racks. Gonna try and Get two for myself. https://t.co/YkLwD0rKav
@GarlandHammer Idiot
@GarlandHammer Stock scam? He didn’t buy or sell any stock. He went thru a complete investigation by the SEC and FBI who found no wrong doing. And who got hurt? You’re claiming ppl shorted the stock with their retirement account? They can’t do that. Try making sense before u slander someone.
@Dolfan99_34 Why would they need to take over a hospital. And those weren’t guerrillas, they were soldiers, ergo,  Batista’s men not Castro’s.

@sunryzen @ShipDontDie @steveblats @TwitchPoker You tell him he doesn’t know how to argue and in the very next sentence call him names and tell him not to procreate.

@cboddy2727 @sdaviespoker @JHOBBS1919 What?
@MissyCakePan @Angry_Polak Again he’s not an employee.
@MartyDerby @audavidb @WPTlive He can deny all he wants. What does that prove?
@Angry_Polak Is he an employee of Twitter???  This example makes no sense.
@boycottfunerals I teach poker classes and love helping ppl improve and want to play more of the game I love. I seriously doubt any of the ppl I have taught will ever play with me. And if they do? Oh well.
@MartyDerby @audavidb @WPTlive There is proof Marty.
@sdaviespoker @JHOBBS1919 Damn!!!!!!!
@boycottfunerals There weren’t learning tools around when all the players u just mentioned came up. If there were they would have used them. My dad sat at a table and dealt out thousands and thousands of hands to get a feel or figure out odds. He didn’t have a computer like the kids do today.
@Angry_Polak I can’t believe I’m reading this. And who is to be the judge of who gets to speak and who should be silenced?

I voted for the two I felt most deserved it.
So... the two people I voted for to go into the Poker Hall of Fame are: the two biggest assholes in the poker world. Reason being: this isn’t a popularity contest and I’m not just voting just for my friends. I’ve had a fist fight with one of the guys I’m voting for.
@EERoberts66 @RomaCoffeeLV1 One of them

As I have said time and again.  POKER IS STUPID
Third hand back from dinner I got my first big pair of the day and got all in preflop. ☠️☠️☠️☠️🤯🤯🤯🤬🤬😰
183k at dinner break. 545 players left.
I just snuck right in the VIP lounge and stole a lavazza espresso. Feel like I really pulled one over on them (Although I guess I’m really allowed in here anyways).  Now I know why @AllenKessler does what he does. #SodaTheif
I’m so tired Grandma. A Jap could be standing three feet in front of me and I couldn’t even incinerate his face. We get up at 9:30, fold all day, then go all in with crap. Tell the @YouStake investors.... Well, just tell them.     Todd

Ok. I guess we gotta lose 22 more faces. I have plenty of chips to min cash but I ain’t @AllenKessler aka. #SodaTheif.  #Go4TheWin
I guess they lost count of the players. They just threw us all out of the room. Lol
If u took a piece of me in the triple draw, razz or stud 8 (10’s) u have a freeroll of me in the main and I’m about to have some money for ur face. (God willing) 💰💰💰
We’re on the money bubble.
Back over 300 dimes
Jammed with pocket 88,99. Raise folded pocket 10’s. Then got pocket AA. Back up to 270k
Picked up pocket 8’s next hand and jammed on opener.  135k and rising
I just looked at Q9 off and almost shoved. Then I remembered my @YouStake investors. #ForTheTeam
Guy had to leave and abandon his big blind final hand. I was sb. Maniac raises button. I have J10 suited. Flop A106. He had an ace. Down to 114k. About 140 out of the money at break
@Certifyedfrench 160k
I think I’m the only survivor, but if anyone else is still alive and wants to go to Roma meet me at my car in the VIP lot.
Damn. Two ppl at my table just completely punted their medium stacks off like their mamas faces were on fire and they had to get home to put em out. 🔥🔥🔥
Crispy https://t.co/zaht1eJrsa
@MarkStehle28117 500 ante 2k-4K
Damn it. Just lost another one for 100k all in with a flush draw and over.     215k

@GuyWisconsin Yes
Welp just lost a 200k pot.  Down to 200k

Caught another kid last hand before break. Got 90% of his face.  Closing in on 300k
Just incinerated another kid that got cute.  Over 200k now
And we’re off https://t.co/naXM73azwT
@christryba Yes

@MarkJunennoonan @ITrepairsCork Hmmm I wonder where the name Brunson originated? 🇮🇪
And we’re off https://t.co/XyvWDRHnOt
Lost close to 100k pot last hand with a straight and flush draw. Finished with 141k.
These kids 🤷‍♂️.  Another one just tried to steal my blind so I flopped a set and burned off 1/3 of his face for him. Over 170 dimes. 🔥🔥🔥
Just shy of 150k going into the final break of the day
@Cernovich And we’re off. 200 ante will get things out of the mud. https://t.co/d6ngbJgsUq
140 dimes. Two more levels to go.   @shaundeeb   #BlowMe
I just got some kid all in on the flop. I only had a pair of 8’s but I was still over a 4-1 favorite. He is no longer with us. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
60k btw
In a little less than an hour the antes double.   #ChannelingMyInnerStuey
Defended my bb and flopped top pair. It was no good so I just hit runner runner to make a flush and partially incinerate this kids face for him. 🔥🔥🔥. Back over 50 dimes again
44k at “dinner”.  They’re trying real hard to give me the chips.
Just lost a 40k flip. AK vs Japs. Flopped an ace, turned a Jap.   45k left
On the break a dealer reaches over and grabs a handful of a players chips who’s away from the table and starts playing with them. Wtf?
I guess the guy I doubled thru is mad.  I raised with pocket JJ and he calls me with 82. Flop 852. Down to 52k
We will be open tomorrow from 8-8. @RomaCoffeeLV1   Located on the corner of Hualapai and Twain. https://t.co/tx26a6IHjX

@fkassela @HistoryNevada @RealKidPoker @MattGlantz Well they obviously both fit the description so I understand ur confusion.  But @MattGlantz is from Israel not Canada.
@HistoryNevada Back over 40k. Luckily this mongoloid moron doesn’t realize QQ’s beat 10’s. #Hurrah4Canada https://t.co/v45JW4tC3w
Wow. On  sixth street daniel has 3 low and hits bad, the other guy has 7’s with his 7’s open. When checked to me I bet. My board is 38J3. He calls and fills up.   What in the world did he think I bet with on sixth street???????  Like I was betting an 8 draw??  Amazing
Just ran it up over 100k straight thru their freakin faces. Then one kid called my 8’s down with 4’s no draw and beat me with two miserable baby pairs. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Still over 80k!!!
This moron raises me when he didn’t even have a pair. He had to call a masseuse to put his face out for him. 🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/KbUhA8TiXV

@coolbearcjs Yes
When I got knocked out of the tournament I had a bottle of kombucha that was 80% full. I didn’t wanna carry it around and I wondered what would happen if I slammed it like a beer. I did and now I know. Btw. Don’t ever slam kombucha.

@red_stagg Yes. That’s why we use spinners.
Thanks for all the support. These tournaments are so frustrating. Not like Lo sneaked into the money these last three tournaments, I had chips in all of them. Wasn’t gonna ante my way to the final table though. #ShootOnGoal

@Stroudrounder @YouStake Don’t remember
Finished 10th.  I think I started with the best hand every hand today. That’s hard to do in stud. Sigh....
Crap I just lost half my face when I jammed it with a straight and flush draw. 🔥🔥🔥
I just cashed right in this tournaments face. 🔥🔥🔥
Wow. We r on the bubble in the 10k stud. Guy gets all in with split aces ,an ace out, vs rolled up 10’s.   Boom!!!  We are still on the bubble
Just lost a hand to Ben yu that was just like the seiver hand yesterday. I had buried JJ vs buried 10 10. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥around 200k now
Seiver just got cute and called me down with deuces so I incinerated 3/4 of his face for him with aces up 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Got most of his face this time with a full boat. 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/quW1BdX3DV
I’m on the featured table. U can watch on twitch.
@themtlgeneral Cricket
@GinaMarieT111 @UFOUNDBOBO @WSOP @maxpescatori Ghey
The next against Jesse Martin: there were three Aces up. I had one of them with the case ace in the hole. Jesse called with the 89Q thinking I was weak. He made two pair and incinerated my face.
Had some questions about the hands. The first against Seiver: racener raised on my right with an A, I had a 7 up and JJ buried, I reraised, seiver was the low card with a 2, re raised again. I put him on a pair bigger than 7’s but probably smaller than JJ’s. I was right 10 10
@GinaMarieT111 @UFOUNDBOBO @WSOP I showed up and u were mia

@dpoole71 @aidankeuter Wasn’t more
@Cville300zxtt @AdamHendrix10 @bobby_brackets Lolololol. U think it doesn’t?. If I tip a pizza guy $3 he might egg my house
@PokerZomb All american Dave’s
@bobby_brackets @AdamHendrix10 That’s how every casino in the world does it.
@ZacharyFogle Ummm. Well u could but I dunno how.
@CaptWade13 He just made it on. 🔥🔥🔥
@AdamHendrix10 @bobby_brackets Really? Then why do they charge us way more?
@aidankeuter I tipped $25 for my lunch and it was right by the poker room.
His name is Abe Mosseri https://t.co/1HVMIXGarH
We are playing 400-800 at the Bellagio and this guy just tipped a girl $5 for a food delivery from the Rio. Now he’s arguing it was a good tip. https://t.co/LbMSwakTrj

@ricardoford9 Yes. Right after Labor Day
I sautéed some oil and garlic and then threw in broccoli, then some cheese. Followed by a garlic, lettuce, provolone, ham sandwich. https://t.co/SrJgaFsUFf
@PokerSasha @lyndaher @pokerkat To clarify: I told the floor, no, a Warning` will not suffice. He needs a penalty. Then he finally got one.
@ChrisSchueller Ya I know. He only got us to the Stanley cup our first year.
The nice thing about owning a restaurant is u can break in at 2 am after getting busted and make a sandwich and steal a soda. Tomorrow will be a fight over who left a mess. 😜 #SodaThief
Went from 10k back up to 40k without getting all in. Played a 85k pot all in pre with AAj67 double suited vs AJJ34. Flop 10 10 J.    Missed day two by 13 minutes.
Sorry. Badacey. I was a little steamed when I wrote that.   150k pot
Just got incinerated with a 5 badugi and 6 low in beduecey
Good start. Incinerated @elielezra1 face for him. Then some other kid got cute so I torched him as well. 🔥🔥🔥
And we’re off. 10k dealers choice https://t.co/s5vpNwyPc9
GG Washington.  Good season knights. One last time for a while. #GoKnightsGo
@PokerSasha @lyndaher Only time I remember anything like this. Like 10 years ago some guy refers to @pokerkat as a ‘cunt’. He had a heavy British accent so I wasn’t sure the first time. The second I told him he can’t say that and called the floor. Floor said Warning, I said no penalty. He got one.
@lyndaher @PokerSasha Ok and what do others at the table do? They just sit there and do nothing?  She says she was assaulted at the table and apparently no one intervened.
@Kevmath Ya that guy’s a bird.
@PokerSasha I seriously find this hard to believe. I have never once seen anything like this in 30 years of poker. What do the men at the table do when this happens? The dealers? The floor ppl? Security?
@_RichardPace @RomaDeliCafe Yes
And we’re off https://t.co/cBfyrxkqqO

@todd_dorsett The anti pasta
@NickNoche Kind of. My Dads uncle stayed in Hawaii after WW2 and married a Jap girl.
I have a ton of half Jap cousins. https://t.co/K7d2PEuxS7
@deweyandyaz Yes. Which is trips with ace king. Not a full house.
I sell small pieces so I know those ppl like updates. Updates include hand histories , and since I usually start with the best hand, when I lose it’s usually a bad beat. https://t.co/JW532AZ3r8
@BG0569 I asked “how is it racist?”   Not if I thought it was or not.
@any2willdo12 And isn’t the nhl exactly 100 years old?
@any2willdo12 That wasn’t the maple leafs. That team no longer exists.
@deweyandyaz It’s Omaha. U must play two cards out of ur hand.
@mitchhecht62 Because a full house beats trips
@marcwl U gotta play two cards out of ur hand in Omaha.
@fkassela @elielezra1 Good. I’ll block both ur sorry asses so u won’t use to listen to any more bad beat stories.
@BG0569 How is it racist ?
@trentum75 @any2willdo12 First of all: not what I said. And second. Do I think it counts if an expansion team is guaranteed a spot in the cup?
@any2willdo12 I think only the blues have done it and that doesn’t really count as that’s when an expansion team was guaranteed to go to the Stanley cup.
@StarwoodGLP Roma one
@PokerAthiest That’s cool. I never saw that. I was in @RealKidPoker b seats.
Just unreal. 5 bets preflop. Flop we're all in and I have AK34  vs QQA4. Flop K28 rainbow. We show our hands and another guy's says he folded the other QQ's. Turn 2, river 2. I'm out
How can this be random? 1,000 ppl in this tournament and they put this Jap next to me??? https://t.co/wfDC9oNdlI
And we’re off. First wsop event of 2018. https://t.co/3aj4n9VT4a
@pokerkat hey Kathy. Can u follow me so I can msg u?
Anyone doing a fantasy team for the wsop this year should probably avoid drafting me (unless u get me real cheap.) as I will be playing mostly cash Regis summer
And we’re off. Nose bleeds but at least I’m here to see history made!!!  #goknightsgo https://t.co/GVsEgXRnXK
I drafted the two most popular players right out of the gate.

@MaticKlaric @DougPolkPoker I started playing 1-2 yes
I say @DougPolkPoker got broke paying too much rake and this idiot is so stupid he thinks I’m serious. He needs to be sterilized.
@WattlesP @TheRealRayDavis @JHOBBS1919 @DougPolkPoker And dusting off???  Ya everyone knows I never win at poker right???  Keep living and hiding  in ur mamas basement loser. Maybe one day you will get the courage to actually post ur pic when u talk shit.

@GFW2GFW2 @hkawastaken So ur saying they came in to the poker room to arrest him in traffic charges and found drugs?
@tapis_volant_ @Nateag02 @JasonMercier @phil_hellmuth @ChrisFerg1963 @GoLeafsGoEh @SylvainLoosli @OneNessOnly @Nizmojiz @harrington25 Make ur own team and let’s see how they match up.
@Lilypad_41 We are Jaybird.
@GFW2GFW2 @hkawastaken But why was he arrested in the Wynn poker room?
That mf @AllenKessler will have his day (or years) behind bars soon enough. #SodaTheif https://t.co/bK0QpdbT7C
@podoc15 There’s more than one ice man. Richard kluklinski is another.
@TheRealRayDavis @JHOBBS1919 @DougPolkPoker That bird  is completely broke between rake and crypto crashing.

The design can be something else entirely as well. Also ‘since 1999’ incorporated if possible.
Anyone graphic designers out there wanna try and make our new logo for Roma coffee? Initial idea is the coliseum with handles like a coffee mug with steam coming from the top in red, white and green. Winner gets a $200 gift card and a chance to steal a soda! #Roma

@ScottM429 I don’t gamble.
So is @RealJamesWoods really dead in the Family Guy universe?
@TuckonSports @audavidb @HPTPoker Like I said, as long as the full amount is paid I don’t see the problem.
@SirToochAlot @audavidb @HPTPoker Don’t get too excited. It’s over rated.
@audavidb @HPTPoker I think it’s fine if all the buy ins are paid.
@audavidb @HPTPoker David are you crazy? Every chip in a tournament is supposed to be represented in the prize pool. Is that stated flat out? No, but it’s so obvious that it doesn’t need to be. Kind of like there’s no law against cannibalism. It’s just common sense.

@JJfuhreal I dunno. I just did it one time and it got a big response so I kept doing it. Helps me remember what time I start and buy in. The Jap was just born a jap.

@RiverRyan23 Just did.
@AwFlath @EmilyJillette @CStrable @RealKidPoker @GarryGates Who said it has to be a valuable organ? “to injure, disfigure, or make imperfect by removing or irreparably damaging parts:”.  And for the record, I do consider my penis a ‘valuable’ organ

@holdem5180 I had never played with him before that trip. I only knew he was the guy who laid down quads in the wsop and the day before he only played 2 hands in 8 hours.
@TyPo41 @RealKidPoker @phil_hellmuth @philivey @TexDolly U just sound like a typical sore loser bitch. What happened again? U got ace high beat???   Oh no. They must be cheating.  And u can’t beat these games?  Lolololol. 🐥🐥🐥🐥

@shaundeeb @YouStake The haters gotta hate hate hate hate hate
Interesting hand tonight. Blinds 500-1k 100 ante, Chip leader opens early to 2500 and gets one call. I’m in the sb with QJ off. I fold. Flop KQ10 two spades. Bet,call. Turn A spades. Check check. River K spades. Opener has AK I would have made a royal. 😱😱

I was once in a hand with @philivey and our hands were tabled in a 100+k pot. 30 second later Barry greenstien walks back in during the next hand and says why didn’t Phil win he back doored a flush. I gave Phil the whole pot. https://t.co/EzyXk1KCBE
If you were a UPS driver and you had 20 pounds of fresh fish to deliver to a business in a shopping center and ur 3 options were: message parlor, tattoo shop or a restaurant: could u figure out who ordered it? This idiot couldn’t
@ScottM429 @sephwest Come on guys. Both are obviously great cities.
@JeremyJoeAllen @DJL10000 @SavagePoker @TexDolly @DougPolkPoker @Joeingram1 @RealKidPoker @RonnieBardah @MattGlantz Cards always speak if the hand is tabled.
@sephwest @MattGlantz Where ur born and from aren’t necessarily the same thing. I was born in Ft Worth. My family moved when I was 3. Is that where I’m from? I don’t know anyone or anything from there.
@Top2pairmurf @SavagePoker @RomaDeliCafe I would like to.... but not going to.

@JHOBBS1919 I drink these
@Wretchy @STACKNupYOchips He won’t learn English in one month but even if he could, I can’t have a horrible waiter for 30 days
@JennHoffman If u call all that ‘far right’ I can’t imagine how far left u must be.
@JennHoffman Far right end? I supported bernie, I support gay rights, legalized pot, increased visas, increased immigration, increased taxes on wealthy..
@FBarnich Tried to buy this one
@Wretchy No that’s not the place. I demanded he be fired yesterday. He made three mistakes on our table. He needs to learn in a different job.
@JennHoffman Jews only have one school of thought? Hmm. Ok.
And they're off https://t.co/O5vweykEJH
@Wretchy I stand corrected and owe u an apology. I didn't know, and can't believe, this guy is a waiter. He's learning fast but shouldn't be a waiter
@JennHoffman Aren't you Jewish?  And far right? I guess the middle looks far right when ur far left.
@MikaelOlsson1 @RomaDeliCafe Ty
@MikaelOlsson1 @RomaDeliCafe Sure
@MikaelOlsson1 @RomaDeliCafe Nice
@MikaelOlsson1 @RomaDeliCafe I never got it.

@burrrrrberry @coinbase I'm in the same boat Melissa. What a joke.
@JasonSouthwell @AllenKessler No they would be nothing. He would steal all our soda from competitors.

@Rhbrideau Yes I know. That's not what he said.
@Leastbest @themouthmatusow Just because ur family farm is worth 10.5 mil doesn't mean u have 2.5 mil sitting around.
Health inspectors just left @RomaDeliCafe . Withall these recent horror stories they wanted 2 see what a clean restaurant looked like. #100%
@philariganello @LogicPainter @themouthmatusow I hear ya.
@gscottholloway @themouthmatusow I started to go into that but 120 and all. There should be a way for the Family to keep any business in the Family somehow.
@UKfan247 @DougPolkPoker Same with me. Ppl say there's no place for violence, I disagree. A lot of the young guys I see now would never act this way where I grew up.
@razi099 @themouthmatusow Hugh?
@DougPolkPoker Ya that guy's a bird.
@philariganello @themouthmatusow Unless u want national defense, police, hospitals, mail, firemen...
@LaceyJones Legos and soccer balls. Gender neutral.
@themouthmatusow Money is taxed almost every time it changes hands. The estate tax is no different. I do believe there should be exemptions for family farms.
@themouthmatusow So u get to keep more when you die???  🤔🤔🤔
@MarkBrining @themouthmatusow The government almost always taxes money every time it changes hands. The death tax is no different.

@TexDolly Well the next guy will know to rob u guys and not the cage.
The jap said he's lost all of those chips and rebought twice already.
They told him he had to go to the main cage to cash his chips. He didn't want to carry 8 racks across the casino so he played on...
The jap was playing 20-40 hold'em when the robbery occurred. Some guy was winning 3k and wanted to quit but the poker cage was closed...
@tzoutzourakis Hugh?
@beardedmiguel @Mace_WinJew Yup
@tzoutzourakis That's it.
@johnstrawa1 @kaptaintrips Yup
@melaexec Dunno
@JPlain75 No. The policy of casinos is to just give up the money.
That's a good question. The Bellagio needs to do an inventory on all their sodas asap !!!  #sodathief https://t.co/G56uVAjHJa
Lol. Can't buy chips in Bellagio poker cage cause it just got robbed.
If u try and give him a dollar in quarters to buy a soda he will insist on $1.25. 25% markup on every one of his transactions #sodathief https://t.co/cFOS0T3pEr
@RomaDeliCafe He then claims he thought the bottled sodas were free for some reason. Even after the waiter "almost tackled him" and told him to pay.
He comes in @RomaDeliCafe and drinks multiple sodas. Then he tries to run out and in his own words "Rge waiter almost tackled me!" ... https://t.co/JK26Kx5Ziv

@Prynce_Vynce @joosh1256 I never liked Obama. But I never disrespected him or rooted against him. He was my President.
@LBKKEKSRK @m5drummer @sportsbud23 GOP is obviously against him.  Who's the one asleep here? And u still didn't answer the question.
@Prynce_Vynce @joosh1256 Ya let's see. Trump got elected and there were literally riots. Obama got elected and got a Nobel prize for literally doing nothing. 🤦‍♂️

@REALJenHarman @Lizzy_Harrison @NevadaSPCA @PH_POKER Are they charging for drinks again at the "VIP" party?
@SavagePoker @LynnGilmartin Ok I just went thru all of mine and her tweets from oct third and still don't see anything. So I guess it just didn't go thru. But ok. 👍
@duckford10 @jlopes_44 @stealthmunk @TobyAFC1 This is true. But investigation is still ongoing. So we will have to wait and see what's released after.
@SavagePoker @LynnGilmartin Show me a screen shot of that and I donate $100
@duckford10 @jlopes_44 @stealthmunk @TobyAFC1 And no cameras were able to film any of this?

@LiberalChick U were winding up to smack @fkassela right in his face! 🤜
@FranklinCente15 Lol. U know how fast u can reload a clip?
@PaulZRad I know
@toppogr81 @jcrosby82 No I haven't seen video proving multiple shooters. I know what it sounds like but there are a lot of buildings and concrete on the strip.
@FranklinCente15 He had stacks and stacks of clips to reload.
@GuruofSpread It is "their". Ur theory doesn't hold water.
@GuruofSpread His brother said he didn't collect guns so unless he's lying this is not the case.
I carried that Jap one more time. https://t.co/Rp6uyRYTbn
And We're off https://t.co/VRRa0PwdE8
@JeppTx U still only need one gun for that. Maybe a back up or two. Not 25.
@bmooreman Exactly.
@npnthr What's odd is him bringing 25 as opposed to 2 increased his odds of detection 1000 fold. For little tactical benefit that I can see.
@Theintilect Well if they don't release it after the investigation? Then we raise hell. Til then? Let's give them a chance.
@jlopes_44 @stealthmunk Escaped in a UFO ?
@OldGavinSmith @themouthmatusow On the contrary, he has only been caught once.
@Brad_Laidman Apparently took them an hour and 15 minutes to breech the door.
@fkassela 👫 💣 ☄️ 🔥 😰 🤕 🚑 🤢 ❄️ ⚰️
@bmooreman That's possible but then he should have just brought more ammo, not guns. Also the same guns, same rounds.
@npnthr Of course. He rationally successfully carried out this task. Not like he was foaming at the mouth.
@real_diculous @KGOLD86 @_OFF_GRID Those tanks were hit and damaged. Airport confirmed this.
@Theintilect They can't see thru bags
@TurtlePoker That's where I do mine.
@TurtlePoker @themouthmatusow If ur waiting for a wire u should contact @Salomonpontecpa
@GuyWisconsin @themouthmatusow Oh mike thinks that? Then I guess it must be true. 👍
@TurtlePoker @themouthmatusow Oh get the hell out of here. Did Matusow make u tweet that?????
@Tobermoree Ummm. Well, good luck with that one.  Lol
@GuyWisconsin @themouthmatusow Hugh? I don't think he was a gun dealer.
@timber7112 Hopefully they will at the conclusion of the investigation.
@joedelucia @themouthmatusow Actually we have cameras inside and out.
@Tobermoree And if we didn't have guns 250 years ago we would still be a English colony.
@Tobermoree Why r ppl from other countries always telling the US what we need?
@TheBossman102 @_OFF_GRID @real_diculous Ok. I know all that and am disputing none of it.
@Theintilect Yup. That's why I said over 20 and not an exact number. It changes every time I hear a report.
@Brad_Laidman That's why I said two. Still wouldn't need over 20.
My thoughts exactly. https://t.co/9XdvxJ2saO
@CashinOutBugsy @TheBobKoch I have a theory. Let's wait and see
@real_diculous Still doesn't explain need for that many guns.
@RuthlessBrett Maybe, maybe not.
@Hoffyness I'm sure that will be released after the investigation is complete. Not before.
@themouthmatusow Mike, why would he pick a location like a casino with all the cameras and security and police to do an arms deal??? U do them at Starbucks.
@jcrosby82 I don't have a firm belief but am leaning heavily toward a single shooter.
@stealthmunk What could plan b entail that would require over 20 rifles? His odds of detection had to skyrocket getting all those to the room unnoticed.
@fold_preflop Ya I saw them. Guys obviously a nut job.
@fold_preflop I understand that. It's because there's an ongoing investigation. If there is a second shooter, they might not want him to know they know.
I have tons of questions that will hopefully be answered once the investigation is done. One big one: why over 20 rifles when only 2 needed? https://t.co/BahfcGBRb7
@Theintilect Yes, yes and yes

@melaexec @themouthmatusow @nolandalla No. His first mission was to find a new trade route to India. Had nothing to do with spreading the word.
@GoTTTTTa @themouthmatusow @nolandalla I just answered this question. My freshman year in high school in history class.
@melaexec @themouthmatusow @nolandalla Any native who didn't get enough gold got his hands cut off.
@melaexec @themouthmatusow @nolandalla The tribes he came into contact with were peaceful and helped rescue him and his men when the Santa Maria sank.
@GoTTTTTa @themouthmatusow @nolandalla Dude read excerpts from his own and best friends private journals. He admits to mass rape and murder and enslaving.
@fgcjr22 @mikeyt64 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla Wrong. He talks about how peaceful the natives he came into contact were and how easy it was going to be to subjugate them.
@melaexec @themouthmatusow @nolandalla You think they all did this?
@mikeyt64 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla You can revere whoever u want. I just said I agreed with Nolan. And there's plenty of history including his own personal journal 4 proof
@nolandalla @GoTTTTTa @themouthmatusow Wtf?????  That's my same answer I just gave!!!!!
@GoTTTTTa @themouthmatusow @nolandalla In my freshman year of high school.
@HarryDoyleESPN @RAB88 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla No.
@loconti69 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla To a certain extent, yes, many did.
@GABreakers @themouthmatusow @nolandalla Just change it to a real hero
@soyyokarim11 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla I'm not on a "reserves".
@mikeyt64 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla I don't believe they were accused of mass murder. So maybe we stop there?
@RAB88 @themouthmatusow @nolandalla The entire or close to the entire population of the islands he conquered. He never reached the main land so ob not all. Only 140 characters
@themouthmatusow Oh then it must be true. If only there were some way to easily research the topic....🤔🤔🤔🤔.  Oh ya.  Google
@themouthmatusow I gotta say I'm with @nolandalla on this one. He was given credit for something he didn't do, committed mass murder, enslaved entire race...
@DougDascenzo79 Ya u we're probably wrong so bye bye
@DougDascenzo79 Yes. Act like a feminist yet enable a sexual predator/rapist.  Sounds like someone else I can think of.
@DougDascenzo79 Really? Was she always 'Maryl Streep'? No. And this was the worst kept secret in Hollywood. And it's not just her.
@DougDascenzo79 She had to have known all about this and thanks him and hangs out with him, takes pics with him, all because it supports her career.
@DougDascenzo79 Actually u have completely lost me. Streep gets on her soap box during acceptance speeches and acts like a feminist and sjw. But in reality
@DougDascenzo79 Because the left wants to throw all kinds of mud til it's one of their own. Then they are strangely quite. Yes they do have a responsibility
@DougDascenzo79 I already hate who?
@DougDascenzo79 What?
@SONNYBILLFAN No because there are all different strands of hiv. When u r exposed to multiple strands it makes the disease progress faster.
@timgreenproject In montana, especially during my tournament, I play small stakes. 1-2 no limit.
@KaufmanPoker So how about if u knowingly had Ebola and donated blood?
@Streeter6Lisa So u can know u have hiv and still donate blood and it's no longer a felony.
@Streeter6Lisa You must not have read the bill or summation.
@KaufmanPoker Really?
Can anyone explain this to me? I'm not being sarcastic. It seems to me knowingly infecting others with a deadly disease is murder. https://t.co/YfV63kjiCK

@Penoyer79 Ppl r much more upset over this shooting. Believe me. They just show it in a different manner. There's no one to blame but the dead guy.
@LaPokertresse @apricotdale Not yet... biding my time.
@Gamblindude @TexDolly @themouthmatusow Sounds like a plan to me. Count me in!!
@Grand_Puba A mass shooting I guess.
@123arnie @ilieknachos Better pop it now In case he knocks out the power grid.
@Penoyer79 No motive? U think he just woke up and said "Wtf? I guess I'll go shoot 500 people today."  We just don't know his motive yet.
@ilieknachos @BKayZone I didn't say he did. The thought of WW3 does.
@LaPokertresse Ya but I didn't say anything bad about asians.

@LilSmyl @RealKidPoker @rushlimpcall @TexDolly @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Dunno if ur joking. Was I supposed to sit on hold more than an hour? Especially after waiting for 2.5 hours for them to show up.
@LilSmyl @RealKidPoker @rushlimpcall @TexDolly @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Yes. They put me on hold for a full hour at which time I gave up.
@Penoyer79 Machine guns have been illegal to the general public for 30 years (without a federal license)
@mikeyv213 @KevinHussey4 I didn't say either one of those things.  What r u talking about?
@Radpoker47 @RealKidPoker The fact that Obama allowed bump stocks to become legal is beyond me.
@marcal611 @ELYRAD @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Not true
@KevinHussey4 @mikeyv213 If income disparity isn't dealt with I believe it will eventually lead to a civil war.
@gowgslexx @clantro @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 So r they using it for something other than to kill something? Like you said ?
@LogicPainter No
@djmacjr Ewe. That's tmi
@djmacjr @shaundeeb Too soon
@djmacjr U r "A Gay". I'm glad I don't have to chose between you and guns.
@jamestmccue Fire away
Civil open debate/discussion is what makes this country great!!!
Guys I don't care if u disagree with me. Happy to have a civil debate. However, I am blocking ppl who r name calling or being rude in gen.
@J4S5W @TexDolly Then u chose very well. Both perfect for home defense. Get the .44 then. Like I said. One of the only handguns that will stop a bear.
The @SodaThief has an accomplice, meet #TriTipTheif. Aka @TheRealRayDavis https://t.co/VzqXfOFj6O
Interesting. https://t.co/4n7ADLp6Aa
@mitchhecht62 @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Sigh. Those were state of the art at the time.
@J4S5W @TexDolly Well depends what ur using it for. Home defense u don't need something as big as a .44. If ur hiking in the forrest u do.
@JJB1919 @RealKidPoker Ok. When I was about to get robbed and pulled out my gun before the guy got to my gf and I. And many times since then.
@sagichnicht123 @gangien @RealKidPoker @rushlimpcall @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 That argument is most likely true if he is armed as well. Doesn't trump every other argument though.
@sagichnicht123 @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 I never said that. I disagree with disarming civilians. That's the first step every tyrant takes. Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot...
@RealKidPoker @rushlimpcall @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Also the intruder I just had? I called 911. They said I was priority one. They never showed at all or even called.
@RealKidPoker @rushlimpcall @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Haven't I told u the story of my neighbor in Montana?He called the cops during a break in, they told him police response was an hour and 1/2
@gowgslexx @clantro @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Not true at all. Do the marksmen in the olympics kill anything?
@mikebadnewsbear @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 You picked a great argument. Typical lib.
@mikebadnewsbear @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 I can name and explain every single one.
@mikebadnewsbear @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 I majored in political science u freakin moron
@ThomasWHanes @TheRealRayDavis Great.
@RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 I'm addicted to the US constitution.
@RealRandyCohen @RealKidPoker @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 @TexDolly Then u r surmising incorrectly. We usually shoot pump or lever action .22's. No clip.
@HtownWiggy @angelo100 @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 One comparison? Heard of nice? 87 ppl killed by a truck last year. How about Vegas last year?
@angelo100 @HtownWiggy @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Careful or @RealKidPoker will tell you you've lost your mind too.
@williejack48 @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 While he really only needed one or two
@goatboy74 @angelo100 @HtownWiggy @RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Name one bigger
@ThomasWHanes @TheRealRayDavis Did u give my tri tip to Raymond?
@RealKidPoker @TexDolly @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 Ur right. Cars have never been used by terrorist. I am stupid and you know everything.

@fkassela @LynnGilmartin Was that the Jap?
@RiverRyan23 U will probably have to start at a bust in joint like the gold spike. At least for a bit
@RiverRyan23 How much experience do u have?
@Giuls_83 @RealKidPoker @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 @TexDolly That only helps with accidents. Not intentional murders like the nice France attack.
@KevoYerets @RealKidPoker @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 @TexDolly We were not talking about automatic rifles! Or semi auto for that matter. We were talking about pump action 22's I use to target shoot.
@StanJames1983 So yes. This conversation WAS all about me and my 3,000 rounds. Why I bought them, what I did with them, was it safe?  All about me.
@StanJames1983 We were talking about me specifically.
@kc_barnard Yes. I like long guns mostly
@KieftThijs @SONNYBILLFAN I'm sure it was a tongue in cheek type joke. I make them too. I never mean anything by them. I'm jealous of anyone who can go without meat.
@kc_barnard We go in montana. I haven't been here in a while.
@StanJames1983 I've been doing this since I was a little kid. So have many of my friends. I've never once known anyone to get injured.
5 of us can shoot off 200 rounds each in an hour or two pretty easily. https://t.co/5gPmZm9zId
@trentum75 @RealKidPoker @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 @TexDolly Let you know? There's have been tons of them. Try google.
@StanJames1983 @sbrounder And how is that?
@SklarGolf @LVMPD @FBI But that is two meals, two sodas and a large 1 liter bottle of water. I couldn't even eat all that.
Guys let's try and keep things civil please. We should be able to have a debate without name calling. https://t.co/PYLaLe8gaJ
@sbrounder I'm a big believer that certain ppl should be kept away from guns.
@sbrounder And there lies the problem.
@sbrounder @RealKidPoker @LilSmyl @CPFro3 @Co1tsfan1844 @TexDolly We aren't talking about assault weapons.
