@michaellarance @Mike_Mason81 @mattBISCEGLIA Hey michael? Who pays your bills? This is what this comes down to, is a sport of professionals. Shouldnt make a difference if it’s tobacco, sugar water, booze, or cbd. This is just a bunch of horse shit.
@bunch624 Because the industry is ran by a bunch of dinasaurs. Let’s hope they step away before the sport is gone.
Funny how @SupercrossLIVE can peddle sugar water to millions of people each year But something as healthy as CBD, which is a new opportunity for sponsorship to teams/riders, is now illegal to promote? Yep, that sounds like motocross🤦🏻‍♂️.
Total horse shit. But nothing new for the promoter and sanctioning body to chase away sponsors from teams, while doing event sponsorships with no kick backs to teams. And people are surprised that teams go away 🤦🏻‍♂️. https://t.co/T5KhJC3gJV

*shouldnt be raising
I grew up w/ Elmer chasing Bugs w/ a shotgun, and there was little issue w/ gun violence. Now “violence” in cartoons is a big deal. Maybe the tv should be raising your kids? Think maybe it’s time to look at parenting rather than “faults”? Just my 2 cents.
I miss @emig47 in the booth, but I think @RickyCarmichael is doing a great job. Bring on A2.
@DM66920320 Our township decided they would rather burn them than end up in a land fill. So the way I travel bothers you? Click that little unfollow button and my life won’t upset you anymore.
I get 3 gallon bottled water that comes in glass w/ a stainless steel base when I’m home. When I travel/go to the track I use @boxedwater . I don’t expect perfection out of anyone. I’m far from it, but if everyone was aware and just reduce by 50%, it would make a difference. https://t.co/NvSgrYGhSJ

@AlPetty232 @justbeckk Yeah wrong again. You should research before you type. But hey trump doesn’t either 👍

@AlPetty232 @justbeckk Man, you have a hard time reading? Go back and read the last sentence. And a good portion of the land that is on fire is federal land. So yes it is in his lap. Take the blinders off bud.

@ScameronScott @realDonaldTrump In this specific situation and specific tweet, you realize this fire is mostly on federal land? But he is blaming local. Can you process that?
@justbeckk But what he is saying is wrong. This is federal land that is burning and he is point the finger at local. And throwing a threat at local as well. Do you see that? Santa Monica mountains are federal.
@My2Cents8 @realDonaldTrump I agree 100%. But stay on topic. This particular situation falls on federal land. And it’s falls on his lap. Yet he makes threats locally? This is the problem!! He doesn’t even realize it’s his department.
@DanMcGranahan @realDonaldTrump You do realize that he is blaming local forest management? And his uneducated self on the matter  doesn’t realize this specific situation he is calling out is in his lap.
@ScameronScott @realDonaldTrump Ummm, as it relates to the tweet, I made a pretty logical comment. What are you talking about?
@mxnuts @realDonaldTrump I personally know 4 families as of now that have lost everything. They are sitting in hotels, watching their lives burn to the ground on the news. And this guy spews bullshit in the wake of their tragedy.
@mxnuts @realDonaldTrump But you just said it yourself. It’s federal land not local. Most of the area burning (santa Monica mountains) is federal. He is turning into a political Cal Dem situation. My only point is throw some compassion before rhetoric.
@My2Cents8 @realDonaldTrump Leave the man alone? How about a companionate tweet before me makes bullshit threats? If your house just burned to the ground you would feel different.
@jbiscoracing @realDonaldTrump What????
@KerriKenney I’m so sorry.
@DellaJCollins 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Peoples lives are in the process of burning to the ground or being lost, and you can’t offer a bit of compassion? Just your typical threats to divide people. Hey genius, most of this is federal land. that’s you buddy. https://t.co/LvM29JMQ08

@MissJenniD29 IMO, it’s parenting, mental health, and the fact that schools are soft targets.
@PartyCatOlivia I own one, but if they want away i wouldn’t lose sleep. I have other rifles i prefer. Not singling u out, but may responses are about gun measures. Don’t you think it’s time our tax dollar protect soft targets (schools)? And not arming teachers, but an extension of our military?
Watching the news this morning, my mind is blown. I really wish people were more down the middle, more logical. I’m pro 2A and completely support common sense gun laws. And i also demand that our government does its job and protects us with our tax dollars. Your thoughts?

@JimmyFNmac they all lie. That's the history of politicians. But let me make that choice, not some idiot anchor who inserts their opinion.
Anyone suggest a better option to CNN, fox, etc?
Our main stream media is a complete joke now. I want to hear interviews and make my own decisions, not listen to an anchor argue w/ a guest.
What happened to the days when new anchors just reported the news and kept their opinions to themselves? @ChrisCuomo keep your opinions.
