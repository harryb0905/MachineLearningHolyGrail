Watch my speech on the Senate floor exposing the Ryan budget's impact on middle-class families. http://t.co/TPn2QbC2 #RyanMath
Paul Ryan and his running mate offer the same old prescription: tax cuts for the rich and austerity for everyone else. #RyanMath
Who are we going to fight for?  Middle-class families or multi-millionaires?  #RyanMath http://t.co/uJ389qlQ
A budget isn’t just a collection of numbers—it’s an expression of principles and priorities. #RyanMath
Instead of helping seniors retire with dignity, the Ryan Budget gives seniors a voucher instead of guaranteed care. #Medicare
The Ryan budget could decimate govt investments in medical research and delay research on cancer, asthma &amp; diabetes. #RyanMath
The Ryan budget could cut education funding by $115 billion over the next decade. #RyanMath
Under the #Ryan budget, 200,000 preschool kids could be kicked off the Head Start rolls in 2014. #RyanMath
Take a look at the numbers in Paul Ryan’s budget—because numbers don’t lie, even if some politicians do. #RyanMath #LyinRyan
What does a candidate do when his vision for the country is good for few &amp; bad for many? In short, he disregards the truth.  #LyinRyan
The Ryan budget cuts taxes for the rich, raises taxes on the middle class &amp; abandons the sick, the poor &amp; our children.  #RyanMath
