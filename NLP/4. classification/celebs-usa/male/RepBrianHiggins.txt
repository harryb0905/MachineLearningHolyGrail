Great news for hometown newspapers in WNY and nationwide. We've urged the ITC and @CommerceGov from the beginning to reconsider these ill-advised and harmful tariffs. Our initial letter here: https://t.co/ad80Ymq4WC https://t.co/p1s6RBkHi5
Correcting the @BuffaloDiocese system of protecting predatory priests starts with acknowledging the severity of the problem &amp; taking decisive action that gives the Catholic &amp; larger community faith the Diocese will do the right thing. That is not happening under @BishopRJMalone.
.@theBuffaloNews writes: “Bishop Malone has lost his way, as well as his credibility, in his handling of abuse allegations against priests in the Diocese of Buffalo. It is time for him to step down.” I agree, @BishopRJMalone should resign.  https://t.co/CM1ijGBPXg

The news that the death toll from Hurricane Maria has reached nearly 3,000 shows us that the federal government's response to this tragedy was, and still is, disappointing and inadequate. We had a responsibility to the people of Puerto Rico and this Administration has failed them

The Buffalo @DeptVetAffairs move to kick our veterans out of a program that works well, providing rehab and camaraderie, and slam the doors shut swiftly on these fine men and women, some whom have no place to go, is a disgrace and a total disservice to our veterans. https://t.co/rVNkWNmNwv
Congrats to our friends, members of the Military Order of the Purple Heart Chapter 187, who were honored at the @buffalobills game on Sunday.  We are grateful for your service and sacrifices. https://t.co/OJybz65anf
This is the latest in over $43M in federal investments on Main Street in Downtown Buffalo.  With the return of cars, we’ve seen the return of economic activity on once desolate blocks, prompting business and residential investments &amp; opportunities from the @BNMC to @CanalsideBflo https://t.co/nnK4Bbp0Ex
Phase 4 of the Cars Sharing Main Street initiative is underway.  This $22.5M infrastructure investment includes $18M in federal transportation funding for work to return cars to lower Main Street from Exchange Street to Scott Street near @CanalsideBflo &amp; improve @NFTAmetro track https://t.co/6GRDJNhvkL

Remembering @SenJohnMcCain, who courageously defended this country and the institution of our democracy.  Brave until the end.
As a state lawmaker, I sponsored legislation in Albany to make priests and other clergy mandatory reporters of abuse (and was admonished by then-Bishop Mansell for my position). Incredibly, this still hasn't happened. Protecting clergy abuse victims needs to be a top priority. https://t.co/a2TxGOB2Cu
Overwhelming evidence recently released clearly shows that Bishop Malone has exhibited poor leadership and knew about children and others put in harm's way. He must resign.  @DAErieCountyNY Flynn &amp; @NewYorkStateAG Underwood must immediately launch a full investigation.

The Buffalo VA Adult Day Health Care Program provides a retreat for the strongest and bravest among us who want nothing more than to again stand - or sit - shoulder to shoulder with their brothers and sisters who served.  They fought for us and we will fight for them. https://t.co/rnh69weO0l
There is no good justification for ending the VA Adult Day Health Care Program, no immediate plans to demolish this building, and no evidence that the VA earnestly attempted to maintain the program at the existing site or an alternate location nearby. https://t.co/QQeZRU1fLK
We still don't have a clear explanation from the VA in it's decision to close the Adult Day Health Care Program, which provides occupational and physical therapy to veterans. Caring for our veterans is not a business- their best interest must always come first. https://t.co/Iuk6a62PPs

For over 240 years, US leaders have demonstrated the willingness to put politics aside when defending the U.S. against foreign threats; until today when the POTUS questioned the veracity of US law enforcement on foreign soil and refused every opportunity to stand up for America.
Who do you believe? We believe @TheJusticeDept. The President’s remarks in #Helsinki2018 to the contrary demonstrates a complete ignorance of the facts, a twisted focus on ego above national security, and a complete lacking of the fortitude needed to defend America democracy.

The #GOPtaxbill is a cruel American betrayal guised as reform that prioritizes getting anything done before doing real good for the American people and economy. https://t.co/uukqYRf7om
The #GOPtaxbill will hurt retirees on Social Security, cost seniors on Medicare &amp; abandon people with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to stay healthy &amp; independent.
This is just the beginning. The #GOPtaxbill will create a manufactured crisis as an excuse to raid the American people of their earned benefits…
The #GOPtaxbill giveaways provided to those who already have much will be paid for on the broken backs of those struggling to simply get a little ahead in life.
This is policy not motivated by bettering the lives of families, students and retirees…it is driven by greed &amp; corporate influencers in a callous move to please stockholders and increase the bottom line of big business.
This #GOPtaxbill provides a heartbreaking catapult to income inequality in America that will serve to grow the gaping wedge between hardworking Americans and wealthy corporate bosses.

We need less confrontation and more collaboration, fewer outbursts and more outcomes, and less heat and more light
These exhausting distractions tear us apart, preventing us from working together and making real progress.
Genuine leadership doesn’t embolden hate; instead, it should promote kindness and understanding.
Each of us bring our own strengths as individuals but we are wise to recognize we are significantly stronger together.
Each of us face our own struggles but they are better overcome when we are united rather than divided.
I am proud to call Bflo - the ‘City of Good Neighbors’ - my home.  As a country &amp; as humans we could all benefit from being more neighborly
This display of intolerance is hurtful to individuals and the noble principles that genuinely make our nation great.
We are witnessing a dangerous and dismissive attitude toward some people as less accepted and less valued than others
Words &amp; actions from those entrusted to lead have demonstrated disrespect for women, refugees, transgender svcmbers &amp; people based on race
