@damartelli @bgtennisnation Yes.  Tennis players have always needed to get organized. People in any space deserve what the market will pay. It might be insane in some cases, but you’re always worth what someone will pay ...... it does pay to organize and utilize leverage

@chrissyteigen @RachelZmusic @psychofan @LiezJKC @lsb @BrooklynDecker @serenawilliams @paramountnet @NewSchoolJazz @johnlegend @OmarHakimdrums It’s easier to point at an easygoing, fun, and innocent TV show as a reason to be angry/unlucky ....
@RachelZmusic @chrissyteigen @psychofan @LiezJKC @lsb @BrooklynDecker @serenawilliams @paramountnet @NewSchoolJazz @johnlegend If I could have made money playing musicians instead of actually getting my ass kicked by the best players on earth ........     is that offer still out there somewhere?  Anywhere? Please?  Maybe? ..... no?
@chrissyteigen @RachelZmusic @psychofan @LiezJKC @lsb @BrooklynDecker @serenawilliams @paramountnet @NewSchoolJazz @johnlegend Im also gonna need to clarify “took your job” .. my payment for @lsb was in the form of a donation to @theARFoundation which was much appreciated.

@_alexismarie24 @babolat Good luck!  I’m no longer on the roster either :)
@Olvy_C @PHShriver @christophclarey 9 hours of playing between two matches is the same regardless of who’s starts. The finish time is the same wether it’s a man or a woman. This cant be hard to understand. They’d be in that position by virtue of potentially having 5 sets to play
@Olvy_C @PHShriver @christophclarey The point is recovery time.  If a man or a woman finishes at 4 am, it hurts both as far as the next match. Start time less important than finish time
@PHShriver @christophclarey Finish time is the finish time.Not sure why the women should play first. Regardless of who starts first, the finish times would be the same. I’d punt my vote into moving courts if first match goes past a certain point. Men can just as easily be handicapped by a late finish right?

@TomVanArsdel Then mixed.He just needs to play any match for the goodbye he deserves.For what it’s worth, Andy wouldn’t have to move much in doubles.Not exactly a bad partner to have for a half court.They would have a real shot to win also. I could respectfully argue they’d have a better shot
Just thinking out loud here. He deserves his moment to say goodbye at Wimbledon. He’s too important to Great Britain and Wimbledon history to not have it..... Would be a pretty cool moment to play doubles w his bro at Wimby if he can’t play singles https://t.co/m7caeL2shX

@Ace_Tennis_Tips @cirseb @PeterKobelt Yes. I prefer to deal in averages and not most extreme circumstances possible .......
@Ace_Tennis_Tips @cirseb @PeterKobelt Well best of the best is a short list. So no. That’s a big stretch from anything I’ve said ......   but at the highest level events?  Well ..... yeah I think that would make sense
@Ace_Tennis_Tips @cirseb @PeterKobelt Yes.  I would confidently argue that. I understand your fascination w name value involved in this particular argument.  That doesn’t change their current rankings ....   also, the “what if” game is a never ending one. My opinion is clear. We can disagree. All good.
@Ace_Tennis_Tips @cirseb @PeterKobelt And I fully welcome you staying away from whatever you’d like .....  I don’t feel entitled to an agreement. I feel confident in the points I can make support my view
@PeterKobelt I just want us to stop using the word “chally”  ....   then we can figure out the rest :)
@Ace_Tennis_Tips @cirseb @PeterKobelt By your logic, do we not have any minor league events in tennis?
@Ace_Tennis_Tips @cirseb @PeterKobelt It’s not disrespectful at all ....  Obviously many talented people playing there. Pointing out that Ferrer dropped down and won a challenger right away after his  worst ATP season in 15 years is actually an argument for my side
@PeterKobelt I have zero issue w challengers having their own records. Would be cool ..... I just think ATP records should happen in actual ATP events.
@cirseb @PeterKobelt That’s offensive to local WCs everywhere I’m sure ..... It was qualies of a minor league event. I try to deal more w facts and less w emotion
@PeterKobelt Should we count matches won in challengers for an ATP W-L ? .....  Is there a line at all between the two ?
@PeterKobelt Yeah I understand where all of these happened. Doubling down on how often it might happen isn’t really making a point on why it should count against records broken at highest level of the sport.
Biggest stat is W-L record. Challenger wins don’t count for ATP W-L ..... not sure why other stats accumulated in challengers would https://t.co/RDKkKlXg2l
@sirdunno It’s still a minor league event.  Challenger wins don’t count for your all time ATP W-L record.  I’m not sure why other stats accumulated would count
@soro77 Sigh ..........   #hypothetical
@DavidLawTennis @bgtennisnation I’m saying it would’ve been an extreme jump for a week based on historical comps of his own ....
@cflekken70 This was 2nd round in a qualifying match apparently. Let’s look up how many points that’s worth :)
@PusherT7 @HernanJFC I would say paychecks from MLB teams on the line. Decent parallel
@sirdunno They’re not, but I consider “on tour” to be ..........   you know...... on tour.
@JRBlake You mean you don’t think someone can add 20 plus mph to their average in one week ?  Mysteriously it went back to normal the week after :)
@bgtennisnation It can’t be a record. Qualies of a minor league event is not an ATP record :)
Should ATP records be allowed to be broken in challengers? Would he have aced someone top 10 that many times in a row? Does a 600 ft home run in AAA break an MLB record?  And go ..... https://t.co/b9KlvmXYuA

@joesanders33 @tezza541 @DanaBerger1982 @UHCougarProud Yeah I agree w that. Situational awareness certainly matters. She certainly has blame to shoulder for opening it up to his discretion
@Laura_Bonetti @Calvbetton @tezza541 @DanaBerger1982 @UHCougarProud Yeah.  When you throw in terms like discretion, it’s kind of whatever he wants to do. There were a lot of ways he could’ve controlled the situation better. Not excusing Serena. She obviously left herself open to that ruling. It went about as badly as it could have
@Calvbetton @tezza541 @DanaBerger1982 @UHCougarProud People.   Please stop explaining to me how a warning, point, and game work.  I understand.  I still think a game penalty without cussing wasn’t warranted. Exceeded crime. I’m not asking you to agree w me. Just stating my opinion based on what I’ve seen for 20 years of pro tennis
@tezza541 @DanaBerger1982 @UHCougarProud Tough to know where the line is. Feels like it moves. Week 1 of US Open, guy got a pep talk for tanking (worse offense IMO) Week 2, she gets a game penalty in final for offending umpire without cussing. Some clarity would help everyone involved
That jacket though ...... https://t.co/ITGXK3tfdC
@Nickolition_ @TennGrand I think she was out of line.  She wasn’t innocent.  It’s my opinion that the the punishment didn’t match the crime
@TennGrand I appreciate the explanation......  what’s the next lesson? I’m so pumped to learn about tennis :)
@vishysblue @Nylahnana Yes and she was penalized for the coaching
This.  Congrats brotha! @johnlegend https://t.co/Czfodhw5fZ
@WomenCANIntl @DanaBerger1982 @UHCougarProud @JRBlake @serenawilliams No I won’t.  I’ve always supported her but she’s got way more money than me :)  I run the @theARFoundation and can find some kids who need it :)
+1 https://t.co/2H2bN36sDQ
@Mark_Edstrom @usta @serenawilliams The problem is that the line apparently moves based on an umpires mood. Different penalties for similar behaviors.  I don’t know where the line is.  Players don’t. Officials might not either
@thetracyaustin @usopen @Chase @jpmorgan I love when we get a chance to hang Tracy!  Safe travels home
@jonathandnyc That’s fine but the line should be clear and known by all parties. I think that’s actually the biggest point
@toohiowithlove Also I’m assuming you saw my follow up to my own tweet that you don’t like ........   it might be “better”.

@DanaBerger1982 @UHCougarProud I’ve regrettably said worse and I’ve never gotten a game penalty
@GlennMParrish I’m ok w disagreement. Too each his/her own.  Others seemingly feel entitled to an agreement
@samskariah @MissJLinda So I’ll only comment on the sport that I played professionally for 13 years ....  I’ve said worse and never got a game penalty in my entire career.  I don’t care how long he’s been a referee. Mistakes happen and I believe he made one. Serena certainly wasn’t perfect either.
@ljdulman @damianjbyrne @terokallioniemi @bgtennisnation Good take
@Grunge_Bob @jaiksahni True
@dalstondavid So you think she self sabotaged a US Open final?
@samskariah @MissJLinda Define responsibility.  I can’t share an opinion that I believe if you don’t agree?  Did I say something inappropriate or offensive?
@jaiksahni Yes. I assume she’d act differently. Still didn’t warrant a game in my opinion
@vishysblue Certainly wasn’t.
@Mark_Edstrom Yes.  I agree. Couldn’t be more impressed.
Yeah only thing is that this is my personal twitter account. I don’t get paid by any network to be objective or professional. Not sure how my opinions are different from ones you might share on your account in that regard. I’m not asking you to agree w my opinions https://t.co/POTirhZtCZ
@therealpiku88 There’s a world where he was coaching, and she didn’t actually see it. I didn’t see every movement from my box.  Let’s see how it shakes out. They could both be telling the truth
@steveappenowitz Yes I understand what happened. Appreciate the attempted translation
@therealpiku88 Also tough to tell how much of it Serena actually saw .....   you certainly don’t see every movement from your box. They could actually both be telling the truth

I’ve seen an umpire borderline coach a player up,and another dock a game for being called a thief in same tourney. There needs to be some continuity in the future https://t.co/T5oI1M0Cu7
Absolutely.  She was in position to win before the game penalty. Couldn’t be more impressed by her. https://t.co/QX0xvs3Ftz
Worst refereeing I’ve ever seen ......   the worst !!!

@JRBlake @briankoppelman @AsiaKateDillon Thank you Brian!   And never James........ never.   Ever
@JRBlake @briankoppelman @AsiaKateDillon What?!?!?  How?!?!?  You?!?!?  Why?!?!   I don’t understand any of this
It’s important to me to #EatWell and maintain my wellbeing while I’m on the road and so thanks @westingrandctrl for keeping it healthy!
Something about landing in NYC :)
The level of tennis at this years @usopen has been insane. Props to all the players for continuing to push their limits. I can’t wait to see how it all shakes out this weekend
This is funny https://t.co/XIke9y9mQM
@keithkreeger @NetJets No Keith ....... no
@keithkreeger @NetJets That sounds awesome
@DavidLawTennis Yeah ..... something like that
@barbarawilk52 I hope it was apparent that he was wrong overall. Me thinking he’s a good person doesn’t equal me thinking it was good judgement
@DavidLawTennis 100 percent. That’s what makes it wrong overall.  Was not the professional thing to do which is why it’s even a story
This was fun ...... https://t.co/wRjEI9RkhJ
So first off Layhani is a good man who genuinely cares about people.  I really like him as a human.....   he did something he shouldn’t have. This is behavior we should see more of these days.

@MardyFish It was glorious.  I should’ve gone w the Fish chunky ponytail look while I had it
@Tennisfan1963 @bgtennisnation Thanks BG!  Stay cool out there #bighat
Ultimate sign of respect is pointing at a guy and saying “that’s how I’d want my children to go about their job someday.” That’s @DavidFerrer87 for me. Absolutely brought it every single day. Congrats amigo!!

@roger1203 @pepsicocom Different scenario. Wimbledon has their rules/traditions. He chose to stay away. Fair enough. They didn’t move the goalposts in response to an outfit that he wore.
People who take the time to write a response? https://t.co/AMBBMobIx3
@RichmondHog @clarencehilljr You also get paid a salary. Her guaranteed income comes from Nike etc ... technically an independent contractor w the tour. Also “traditions” don’t normally have to move the goalposts mid game. Wimbledon has been consistent since beginning
@jad_s969 Google Anne White Wimbledon 1985 ...... I’ll be right here when you come back
@bradleyc27 Google Anne White Wimbledon 1985, and then I’ll let you retract your statement

@MardyFish Preach
@EFRIZZY I did
@MardyFish With what you’d change ..
@VantaggioTennis Different circumstance as tennis players are technically independent contractors. Guaranteed money would come in the form of a revenue share of some sort or negotiating higher overall percentage of prize money w tour/tournaments
@nolechick02 My mom was a teacher ......  all the best !
@nolechick02 Teachers are a different conversation completely.  You’re the best of it, and I will tip my cap to you forever.
@TheLeftyWizard Had to happen. Unfortunate but necessary.  They built it for situations like that.
@Maniacazza @unlimited_sport Not a celebrity ...... just someone that you choose to follow :)
@Tennis_Pusher Hahahahaha......   yes. Your tweet was extremely funny though
@stevegtennis Dictated by revenue. that’s why I’ve argued that players should focus on unionizing to address things like rev sharing w merchandising etc.Prize  money is the tip of the iceberg but gets 100% of focus. You can’t take away from players creating the $. Let’s find other rev streams
Thanks for explaining. I was completely lost ........  I’ve lost at every single stage of a grand slam tournament and won all the way through. I promise I understand all parts of the equation https://t.co/ZBfv6GIfWT
@IngeCommissaris @KrisSoutar I promise there is this crazy world out there where you can be extremely passionate about something, and also have a mind for business ......   you don’t automatically lose one by having both
@SpaceshipGuido That’s very different than your first response
@JRotsaert @NBA @NFL @NASCAR Agreed on that point
@SpaceshipGuido So the players who create the revenue should give it away to the players that haven’t created revenue ..   I played challengers also.  I didn’t expect to make money until I made it to tournaments that actually made money. There’s an equal opportunity for everyone to do the same
@joesanders33 They give a ton more on a week to week basis than tennis.  Also the max daily attendance at Merion for  example was about 25,000 for the day.  That’s one night session at US Open
I’m sure you love your job also.  I’m sure you also expect to be compensated at work......   it’s not one or the other. https://t.co/xwSbiv1MME
@JRotsaert It’s relative to your peers. Mediocrity as it pertains to a US Open as opposed to a city tourney is obviously different.....   I assumed that would be implied
I definitely like the escalating pay scale as you go, and hate rewarding mediocrity.....  I just think the difference for final versus a win is a bit ridiculous https://t.co/Ng3wYjeBE2
So if you make a final, you’d make more to win that one match than you’d make for winning 6 over the course of two weeks ...... Anyways, I guess it grabs a headline when you announce 3.8 million to the winner. I’m sure that’s not the goal though :)    Right? https://t.co/ey6dkLXH4V
And thank you @KAndersonATP for being an example of class and humility.  You’ve earned the success that has come your way. Enjoy finals Sunday big guy! https://t.co/DziWoHn7TL

@darrenrovell Lesson for everyone else also..... he’s ok w being criticized :)     He’s also ok w his return on Blaze. I think you overvalue how much he cares about the twitter keyboard warriors

@NickMcCarvel @hillbillytennis @ATPtennisradio @gigi_salmon I can’t do that.  I’d get too upset.
@hillbillytennis @ATPtennisradio @NickMcCarvel @gigi_salmon Not to mention, I used a towel after almost every point and was still one of the fastest paced players between points ever ....  I prefer the shot clock. How are you gonna tell someone they can’t wipe sweat off ? In a sport? Where your hands need to be dry ...... cause tennis
@hillbillytennis @ATPtennisradio @NickMcCarvel @gigi_salmon Would it suck if I made you use the worst possible version/quality of a microphone or camera at all times? Would that be insane? .......
@hillbillytennis @ATPtennisradio @NickMcCarvel @gigi_salmon Wait wait wait ..... @NickMcCarvel you’re gonna ban players from using towels?  For sweat? Like as in to keep it off of a grip which we need to be able to use. Preferably a dry one ........ cause it’s tennis... and sweat.... and holding the racket... and
The whole thing is a joke. The last minute and 15 is gold. Skip basically submits a 1st grade book report everyday on air. It’s laughable to anyone who’s ever actually done it. This was a heavyweight against a flyweight https://t.co/fJt9UoDJqN

@JRBlake @KAndersonATP Maybe I’m just an optimist James. I would’ve convinced myself I had a chance :)
@JRBlake @KAndersonATP Better question .....  what percentage of people would I have given that call to?
@chriswittenborn I’m not good enough to play it anymore. I haven’t played tennis in 6 months.  That matters hahahaha
@JRBlake @KAndersonATP Less.  Especially cause it looked like he actually had a play on it if we are talking about the same shot .......  you talk like a tournament director now
@JRBlake @KAndersonATP I would’ve said the call came and I stopped running. Based in fact hahahaha .....   sportsmanship awards are cute
@joesanders33 @JamieSlonis @DilfersDimes Well yeah.  I would hope so
@joesanders33 @JamieSlonis @DilfersDimes Way less severe but I get the point
@joesanders33 @JamieSlonis @DilfersDimes We were talking about that. Then you said it’s like saying a golfer could go play QB. One is way more likely.  I don’t think the PGA should grant exemptions to unqualified people either. Even though it was beneficial for the tourney
@JamieSlonis @joesanders33 Does that just mean he made the golf team there in his spare time?
@joesanders33 @JamieSlonis @DilfersDimes And 775 is a weak team. I’ve heard all about it, but was less than impressed last week. “We win here, we win there. Blah blah blah “....... and here’s a loss
@joesanders33 @JamieSlonis @DilfersDimes Ok but saying it’s apples to apples is incorrect. Only based on those facts you love :) .....   there is actual proof that a former athlete can become a pro golfer w time spent
@joesanders33 @JamieSlonis John Brodie won the 1970 NFL MVP.  He also won a senior PGA event. So there’s that .......

I had to start watching Homeland ASAP.  I had heard good things ...... https://t.co/JH6p88Ge7Z
If Roger wins two this year, his grand slam count can legally drink in America https://t.co/91srWEZCCR
I found this interesting. Makes sense that companies starting to value engagement more than an actual follower count when it comes to influencers https://t.co/TPxDdk6MdG
@JeremyPond No sarcasm .....  I am genuinely curious as it seems to be a common fallback
@JeremyPond Also everyone always mentions time as an excuse for a prediction gone wrong ..... what’s the proper expiration date on a twitter prediction?  Just so I know for future judgement
@JeremyPond Less about an opinion. More about  sarcastic verbiage like shocker and #fact ..  a condescending tone from the comfort of a keyboard directed at someone who had already been number 1 and was still around 23 years old felt like a stretch to me ...
Fair play :)   I withdraw my attitude towards the original tweet https://t.co/lReDbXcDkU
@Deuirej Would be logical to think he’s changed his mind about her winning a slam now :)
@plbHQ Not to mention a career match win percentage well over 70 percent. Super impressive
@plbHQ World number 1 a couple of times ..... close to 30 titles. Not all single slam winners are the same. I think an in depth look a total career accomplishment is important ..... She should be in. She’s been a top player for a decade. 600 ish total wins etc
@KamChan08 Maybe the way it’s done ..... doing things like #FACT when it’s not makes a difference.  Notice I didn’t say “having a discussion” or “sharing an opinion” ..... talking trash is different to me. The condescending nature of his statement was annoying
Easy to talk shit when you don’t actually have to go out and do it yourself. I love it when people prove themselves over the long run .... #FACT #keyboardwarrior #HOF https://t.co/whXG74GZaI
Couldn’t be happier for @CaroWozniacki !!  Enjoy your moment !!!   #HOF      I want that moment for @Simona_Halep . It’s coming ......

@StakknBenjamins @MardyFish @FrancaVillian I’m guessing he didn’t formally file retirement papers. He just stopped playing
@JueshaRawr @N1rla I almost wouldn’t know what to do :)  thanks for the note!!  Be well
@N1rla One was a choice.  The other just happened
@N1rla The way I play now? Maybe less than a twitter account hahahaha
@bernardofrg Bernardo that might make too much sense .....
@DavidLawTennis @rajeshworld @seriouspiff @TennisPodcast Nobody calls you that
@DavidLawTennis @rajeshworld @seriouspiff You’re David Law. You are very very tall. You are the media director at Queens Club. You get plenty of rest .....  can you hear me?
@DavidLawTennis @rajeshworld @seriouspiff David way to stand by him. He’s the only one who’s agreed w you :)
@PandaManV4 @darren_cahill No.  This is between me and Darren .........   in front of twitter
@darren_cahill Darren, I don’t care what Christian says......  I really really like you
@rajeshworld @DavidLawTennis @seriouspiff You don’t agree w which matches I found too have the toughest recovery turnaround?   I don’t even know what to do w that ......   they were my matches, so .........      ok cool
@DavidLawTennis @toddwoodbridge @jeffharbach True David. Accountability is tough :)
@toddwoodbridge Ill give you this ......  you’re correct. It’s tough to imitate 6ft 10inches
@alexjbantz @toddwoodbridge For clarity. You’re already happy to say Kyrgios is a better server than Isner, Karlovic, Krajicek, Rusedski, Goran, and Federer amongst others ?
@toddwoodbridge And you went w 2 Aussies.  I get it.
@jeffharbach @toddwoodbridge Factual @jeffharbach .... it was obviously for my shyness and sensitivity
Woah woah woah ....   Goran, Isner, Karlovic should be on this list    @toddwoodbridge  :) https://t.co/KRll1hYzkr
@JerryDo10082004 @lauriemac123 @Noleno1champ He’s won the Aussie Open 6 times. His coach won it 5 times. They don’t need my advice on anything Aussie Open related
@JerryDo10082004 @lauriemac123 @Noleno1champ Actually .......  yes
@RayBundell Yes. I understand heat and have played there when it felt like a hair dryer. Brutal for sure. ......  I really liked how my serve jumped w the roof open though :)
@JerryDo10082004 @lauriemac123 @Noleno1champ Tough to a hypothetical. The “could be” or “what if” game never ends ...... I promise :)
@DavidLawTennis @Noleno1champ First round Atlanta 2010 against Ram. I felt like I was standing in the sun ...... I also later found out I had mono as well. That probably didn’t help
@lauriemac123 @Noleno1champ I’m not the one to ask .... sounds like I’d be in the minority if people who wanted it left open. I’m fully aware this was completely self serving
@DavidLawTennis @Noleno1champ All of that ..... and gluten
@DavidLawTennis @Noleno1champ Very very impressive! Maybe the biggest example of turning a weakness into a strength is tennis history .....   and I don’t say that lightly
@DavidLawTennis @RayBundell @seriouspiff David it makes me uncomfortable that some media directors have to work all night, and you get to have dinner and recover every night during Queens .....  how do you plan to make amends for this disparity? Maybe a donation to those who work longer hours?
@pandsreid @RayBundell @DavidLawTennis @seriouspiff And it’s less about pandering to the players request... Marrying TV requests to the other factors dictates schedule w TV carrying by far the most weight
@RayBundell @DavidLawTennis @seriouspiff That’s why he’s the media director at a tourney that doesn’t have lights :)   Was all part of his master plan
@CodrutBaciu @Kamakshi_Tandon @DavidLawTennis Touché. Was looking for some context......  I also used to wear a visor. That was also a mistake
@Noleno1champ What exactly are we all upset about? It benefits Novak to play Gael in extreme conditions.....  not an outlier of an opinion from me
@Kamakshi_Tandon @DavidLawTennis Gotcha.....  was looking for context like a date, article, what its specificity was etc.
@Kamakshi_Tandon @DavidLawTennis I’ll be the first to raise my hand and say that take was a bit naive .....  I don’t have the tape from the last 18 years of your life so I’m at a bit of a disadvantage ....  seems unfair :)
@rajeshworld @DavidLawTennis @seriouspiff I played a lot of matches. Conditions always the same for both ... hot, cold, day, night, etc    always the same and nobody ever played a point for me or helped me between the lines.  Night matches were brutal because lack of recovery time. Toughest matches for the turnaround
@Kamakshi_Tandon @DavidLawTennis You can’t treat sports like a business?  Players are independent contractors who decide to play by these rules. We don’t pull salaries, and can step away at any time if we don’t see things as fair. You are also in the business of tennis by trade ....
@vamosanyone @amaxi @praveen_248 @ClaireyyM Surely respect can be applied all around right?  Or are you making me choose?
@WinningPretty_ I wouldn’t be alone ...
@WinningPretty_ I’m in awe of a lot of the guys playing now. Roger included ... I’m assuming you weren’t being snarky ....
@Nadir_Hassan @umairjav He also makes 20 million dollars a year in endorsements for the inconvenience :)
@DavidLawTennis @seriouspiff Your job needs the audience that certain players create also ......   your comfort level probably doesn’t factor into high level decision making :)   There’s always gonna be a tough decision that has to be made David.
@WinningPretty_ This isn’t about Roger or Novak. I’m not blinded by fandom. They’re both on short list of all time greats.  The dollar numbers in my arguments matter more to me than the names attached.  Ignorant to think there won’t be names attached though :)
@Nadir_Hassan The networks more often than not. People who pay the bills make the decisions....
@seriouspiff So would be better now if it hadn’t had a Tiger era? Or a Nicklaus era? Or an Arnold Palmer ....    all to protect from consumer disappointment when they’re not there?  There wouldn’t be any consumers without them
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever Super.  I would like this conversation to be over now
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever So narrow minded it’s frightening ..... you start at the answer. Fairness is your answer so you work backwards. I’ll take all the facts in, and then form an opinion based on all factors. Not just one....  be open to not starting at your answer
@alexvlah1 @atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever Yes
@CrawfCh I’m not a doctor so I might be talking from a place of ignorance..... I never wanted roof closed. I felt I was physically prepared and that had been worked for. Also court is more “alive” w roof open. Suited my game when ball was jumping around in the heat ....
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever There are 128 players on each side of the singles draws. More in doubles. All differing opinions of what’s “fair”.  Good luck finding your sweet spot.  One thing that is a commonality amongst all of them is that they enjoy playing for more money. That has to be created somehow
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever So ......  conditional fairness.....  sounds like a perfect fix. (Shakes Head)
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever You’re right.  I’m sure tennis would be much better off as a whole if they played Roger/Rafa/Serena/Novak/Maria out on court 13 just as often as everyone else ...... I feel like I’m taking crazy pills
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever I would say that tennis is the ultimate show of equality of opportunity. Every tournament, the last guy in has the same opportunity to win the ultimate prize as the greats!  Last I checked everyone had to win 7 matches .....  society would be lucky to have that system in place
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever That’s the point.  I got what I earned ....  it was completely fair, all things considered.
@ThenIdBeClever @atulkulkarni77 Fair isn’t a real thing in sports.  You’ll be on this search for a long time. Sometimes it’s easier to complain
@ThenIdBeClever @atulkulkarni77 I can’t tell you how many times at US based tournies I played second night match after Andre/Pete. Not the preferred time w recovery etc. I couldn’t possibly complain, as they built the tournaments and audiences I was gonna play for .... not fun starting at 11 at night, but fair
@ThenIdBeClever @atulkulkarni77 You can’t understand that Roger has had as much to do w the game growing financially as any man or woman in history ?   People take the checks and then complain all in the same breath ....   This can’t be impossible to grasp
@atulkulkarni77 @ThenIdBeClever Playing parts of draws on different days will ensure nothing is ever 100 percent fair. Of the 5 slam finals I played, 4 of them I had to play a semi the day before .... rain, scheduling, TV preferred matches etc. Fair is often an illusion. I always understood the reasoning
@praveen_248 @ClaireyyM He has a team full of people who would make that request for him. He could have made the request without the request coming directly from his mouth.  That’s how it works
@ClaireyyM @lookaug There are a lot of people in payroll who can make that request on his behalf :)
@ThenIdBeClever The same people who whine about fairness are also the ones who are pumped about the major bump in prize money over the last 5 years .....    having cake and eating it ....
@seriouspiff That’s an insane take. Golf was never healthier than when Tiger was thriving. Its success was in lockstep w his. Why not maximize while it’s a possibility?
@ClaireyyM I had actually heard that Novak wanted Monfils in the best and had requested it .....  I think it was as simple as Novak wanted to play day, Roger wanted to play. Everything is great, and we can all be happy :)
Let’s not pretend like this isn’t a business. The longer Roger is in an event, the more eyeballs are on screens, the more ad/sponsor money in etc .......   so yes, they will listen to what the stars have to say. It’s sensical https://t.co/3Nn4eeMjd5
Cool cool cool https://t.co/qpYP9CCVnh

@BirdCornish @button_linda @Tennis_Now Davydenko worked his ass off and earned every bit of what he has. Absolutely maximized what he had ..... Not close to the same.
@tennisandting My slump in form was never because of a lack of effort or indifference. That probably dictates public sentiment more than anything. Unfortunately, you sleep in the bed you make.
@DavidLawTennis Agreed.  Two options I suggest ..... work hard and count more....  stop playing the game you seemingly hate, and count all day in private. No problem if his motivation is financial. We all tick differently
Self inflicted ..... no sympathy here. I’m not upset for you defending anyone you want to. I just strongly disagree. Feel free to write what you want in your account ... I’ll handle mine https://t.co/czVPsVtEk5

@darrenrovell @crupicrupicrupi Fair .....   live nature of sports also tough to normal TV. You would think it wouldn’t be as drastically changed
@darrenrovell @crupicrupicrupi Playoffs will be telling.....  also important to compare all games as opposed to just highest rated on a given Cowboy night :)
@darrenrovell @crupicrupicrupi Bit of a misleading stat.  Important to separate seasons. An accurate gauge would be comparison of one season to the next. No question NFL has been a monster. Question is if it continues ....
@HogansBookLied @AN_Golf @TigerWoods Apparently I forgot to tailor my shirts ........  for sports.... who says twitter can’t add value?

When Rafa wins something, his fans start throwing darts at Fed. When Fed wins, darts at Rafa. Most annoying part about tennis fandom for me
Only because everyone else who got there is really good :). don't forget the loss in 09 also ..... thanks for the @   ....   cool cool cool https://t.co/v05PwEKNbf
@phil4321566 Yeah....  didn't even notice until someone pointed it out.....  oh well
True story.  I believe I told him he was getting carried away ..... turns out he was wrong ....  he sold him short :) https://t.co/kJ3tV0y0A2
Fact.  I never played a match for 4 days ... Rafa lost 35 games in an entire slam. Isner lost 68 in one set, and won that set https://t.co/HtzH86YVRz
Back?  Back would require them having left ..... https://t.co/8M2l5Wh3Qa
He lost 35 games in the entire tournament ......  I'm pretty sure I've lost my car keys 35 times this year .....
10 ...... 10 .......   10 ..... you can say it as much as you want. It's so not normal.  Huge respect for @RafaelNadal .. pleasure to watch
@EricEdmeades Happy to be wrong! Game is better when Rafa is playing great .....  great effort to get back to his highest level
I'm not Selena Gomez ... sorry.  Vote for @mrBobbyBones anyways https://t.co/S0KmzyfoVp

@RealPureLife @ATPWorldTour Ok .....   he was being sarcastic.  I thought that had to be a given right?
Yeah I got that .....   I speak sarcasm https://t.co/1eqfTzs32b
Kerr is so right on this. I can't tell you how many athletes have a hard time admitting this... It's ok pros. Doesn't mean you weren't great https://t.co/PuiT1jr9V8
@HockeyChick107 @MardyFish I don't think anyone who knows something about tennis ever questioned Roger about skipping the French ....

@RobbyM1 Currently yes ... I try to make a habit of switching around to different networks. Important to digest news in different way IMO
How many people/opinions are too many sitting around a news desk ?  I currently see 10 people talking ....
@D_Beilinson The what if game never ends, and it's a fruitless labor.....   it hurts my head too much to partake. Round and round w no end every in sight
@BrianKuscher I didn't break 600. I broke a lot of them ... not close to 600.  I'm trying not to let the truth get in the way of a good story

@_markpetchey @DavidLawTennis @Malcolm_McD @BenRothenberg @BillSimons1 They need her less so it's certainly not as obvious of a decision ...  people mad at Stuttgart tourney for granting WC are ridiculous
@_markpetchey @DavidLawTennis @Malcolm_McD @BenRothenberg @BillSimons1 This isn't a guilt or innocence issue for me. It's being smart enough to understand why tournaments would want Maria in the draw
@0try @DavidLawTennis @Malcolm_McD @BenRothenberg @BillSimons1 Absolutely some fault in not knowing ....  hence the suspension
@bellebumbles This is your first point I've agreed w. It's not a viable excuse ......   hence the suspension. She has admitted this much
@bellebumbles @triscoe @BenRothenberg @Malcolm_McD @BillSimons1 If you're in the small tournament business, and it adds an extreme amount of value which can create jobs, help city, tennis etc.. then yes.
@DavidLawTennis @Malcolm_McD @BenRothenberg @BillSimons1 Now that's a more interesting conversation. Comes down to if they believe that she didn't know banned list had changed, and she didn't know
@bellebumbles That would imply she knew it had been banned for the one tourney she played when it wasn't legal. I don't think she did.
Hurting yourself versus hurting other people should be viewed through a completely different lens. They shouldn't be treated the same https://t.co/hJabyvVJa5
@Malcolm_McD @BenRothenberg @BillSimons1 It's necessary.  If tennis doesn't work as a business first, we won't have anything to watch.
And by ballboy I meant he was yelling and running around where he wasn't supposed to be. Occasionally he would throw a tennis ball somewhere https://t.co/uyauLTgDP2

@teamtrent2  I'm sure a significant year plus (warranted IMO) suspension plays a part in making someone feel responsible for actions
@teamtrent2  not our decision to make.  If it means a tournament thriving and surviving another year, then I understand a business decision.

Catch me on @FoxBusiness tomorrow morning! Talking all things Fed/Nadal/Williams, tennis business, and @get_charly ! https://t.co/pVP7h2IvBw
@Vtennisfan you're making my point ... Fed/Nadal rested physically and mentally ... Djoker/Murray definitely had some scar tissue from '16
@idyllmind it would have made me view the decision through a bit of a different lens for sure.... Impossible to state anything w certainty
@AlanAvm1502  I've discovered recently that it's much easier to have all the answers from the couch ....
@AlanAvm1502   I guess you would know better than I would.  Cheers!
@AlanAvm1502  you understand that it's a scheduling issue right?They're not gonna pull out of world tour finals most years.Last week of year
@hockeysymposium @djgura   Correct
@AlanAvm1502   Good.  It looked like he needs it after dominating for 4 plus years. I'd say that validates a month off :)
@AlanAvm1502   Which is why they should play world tour finals in October and have all optional 250s afterwards.  Similar to golf schedule
@djgura @hockeysymposium  huge bonuses in most contracts for finishing as number 1 ...  not to mention it's huge historically as well
@AlanAvm1502  yes and I have no issue as it's a choice and not a requirement .....  not up to us or anyone else to decide
@j_haapiainen @wendydshaffer   Wrong. Tournaments pay appearance fees now. Would be their option to continue that practice to get sponsors
@absurdities  play tour finals in October... nothing but optional 250s afterwards. Playing late in season would be a choice not requirement
@_paulthomas_    Very very significant. Not sure of the rules on WTA. Smart enough to play their year end finals earlier than the men
@absurdities they would also benefit from legends being around.Similar to how everyone wins in golf from trickle down effect of having Tiger
@_paulthomas_   Would have definitely changed the way I thought about it ...
@_paulthomas_    It's fine .... I stopped when I was 30 :)
@Lasercat1975  means we'd be playing at about the same level these days :)
There are exemptions. Unfortunately, by the time people hit those exemptions, a lot of the damage has been done  https://t.co/rSJEqHFSuf
@big_ml  correct ... hence my point about having the long view of protecting your best assets for as long as possible
@rogerYOcheng   I promise I understand how it all works
The same people that represent the tournaments :)     Genius right?  https://t.co/VgRwzL6KFM
@big_ml  plenty of time for all of it if off-season was longer. One entity can't control another when we are "independent contractors"
So you would be ok paying money for the right to play less? To a tour that you have helped thrive??? .......  no  https://t.co/2idPMPSZ4m
Fines come from the tour. Confusing considering they would benefit the most from stars playing longer careers  https://t.co/oBTlGFG0lC
That would be great, but you actually get fined for not playing minimum number of tournaments...   https://t.co/YAj0GlEuxD
In order for them to have taken time, they would have had to not care about year end no. 1....   they were stuck  https://t.co/6LDpodGQDs
If Rafa and Roger didn't prove the benefits of a longer offseason, I don't know what will.Let's be smart w our players and promote longevity
It used to piss me off playing w these guys. Now it just makes me happy all the time.  @rogerfederer @RafaelNadal @andy_murray @DjokerNole
And to @RafaelNadal ...   one of the classiest champions I've ever known. Tennis is lucky for having you in it ... GRANDE
Everyone stop right now .. take 6 months off.  Come back.  Win .....  can't believe what I watched.  Congrats to my friend @rogerfederer
@WongOldMan @JackDaniel1806  why are in a rush to answer this question ... wouldn't it be easier when they've each finished a career?
@IvanaFedex  I definitely agree right now .... The lifetime stats are deceiving because he's been out there significantly longer .....
@pandsreid @LadyBellatrix   Not entirely but if Fed wins and gets to 18, I don't think that difference gets made up.....
@daverolfe  I think said last year saying my dog could coach Roger successfully. Not sure if any new info available between Fed and Rafa
@LadyBellatrix  fair ..... I think these guys making their runs brought it back :)      I do think the significance of it is massive
@LadyBellatrix  my most important comments started the GOAT conversation???   This conversation has been going on forever

@KMillar15 @joshbeckett @JoshBooty10 pleasure doing business as always... Appreciate your prompt payment :)
Check out my guy @mrBobbyBones out w his book #BareBones out today!
@1LondonPaul  or Lyft should see this as an opportunity to make a serious move on Uber and steal the market .....
@1LondonPaul   What does he do? Whatever it is, you could probably do it better ....
@1LondonPaul @ffarsenalfc  you were 20 years younger at one point. You weren't a footballer then either ....
Something to think about .......  If we could only find a sponsor ......  https://t.co/miiusfG4zh
Not this year unfortunately  https://t.co/r4A5ZUiKPV
@1LondonPaul @ffarsenalfc what I can't figure out is why they didn't offer Paul the deal. He actually deserves more cause he passes better

Not apples to apples. Giving credit to Rafa for winning 14 majors is a given. He's one of the best of all time ..... https://t.co/rYigo8fNZv
Not defending him ..... Won't let people claim superior football skills as compared to him from their couches  https://t.co/65afK9QmBa
Tell you what ... If/when he wins RG, then tweet me. Til then you're trying to disprove a statement too early  https://t.co/thMHCJB7cr
Ok ......   Never said he wouldn't win on clay again either.  You're points are ones I wouldn't have argued against  https://t.co/thMHCJB7cr
Saying he's been shit is one thing .... Saying Paul could be better at football is losing credibility of opinion  https://t.co/lMdwGJ4zL0
No ......  You couldn't.  https://t.co/NcJy0kGYEy
Awesome.  Good talk......  https://t.co/dJ0fMdgbGW

Conversation..... If you could have one person play a private party for you and your friends, who would it be???
@dm449   You wouldn't be able to judge, because I wouldn't be holding regular press conferences .....
And for the record, Ken Kratz is a massive piece of shit too ...... #makeamurderer
@laurarobson5    Fact
@EJohnsonMPLS   Not a requirement for anyone to talk to the media ...
I'm sick of Mike Halbach doing interviews and smirking .... #MakingAMurderer
I'm watching Making A Murderer ....   My jaw literally drops every 10 minutes.
@Ivan55k  1. I wouldn't care  2. I didn't call him a microwave. I called Wawrinka a microwave. He can get hot quickly. How's that offensive?
This just doesn't get old ..... https://t.co/kkV1bw94uC
She just cried at that one too ......   Holy shit. What is happening ?  https://t.co/jEkoDGqohs
That's the one ....  https://t.co/7G7ZePzbIM
I pointed and laughed ........   How'd I do?  https://t.co/eopay46RQa
My wife just broke down crying during a commercial ..........    It was for Olive Garden        @BrooklynDecker

You guys are awesome !  Thanks @CantSeeApparel @mrBobbyBones  https://t.co/vL8XnRuMVB
@PhoenixMaster95 @serenawilliams   Yeah ..... Either my influence or the 4 straight slams that she won .....
@nztennispodcast @MardyFish @TennisChannel @JRBlake    So at least Bopanna wasn't having an off day when he beat James 6-0 ... Encouraging
@MardyFish @TennisChannel @JRBlake    How many games did he win?

. @JRBlake  went from judging social media for years to making sure that we know what he had for breakfast ....  https://t.co/u4jeUg18fW
I would have loved to have played ....  https://t.co/r7paqYvcbs
. Correction ... It's actually itsjust_abigail who's the cheese wolf lady .......    Just kinda weird
At a dinner party and someone just described someone as looking like a "cheese wolf"... Quick. Help!  What the fuck does that mean?????
Hahaha.   Funny  https://t.co/Dl8JaS4RFj
Please tell them that you'd like to have me back .....   @bbctennis  https://t.co/25xlCohRd9
Read your bio and saw that you were on a first name basis w him ...... Figured I'd just follow the trend   https://t.co/PjG1ozoXXh
. @HashtagLosing I'm sure Ljubo is a great coach and has certainly been there.I also think he would tell you that his cat could coach Roger
@PSchrags @TheHerd @ColinCowherd   Go at him?  I didn't see Mason and Oakley defending many pull ups from 27 ft ........
@MRusselltennis @MardyFish   Like ........   Practice?
Shit.....  https://t.co/IUnC8gq14u
. @MardyFish I was gonna have a nice little hit around, and now I have to play a guy who was beating top 20 guys this Summer?    BS
. @BrooklynDecker  you're a really great singer..... really.... I'm not just saying that cause we're married and have a child together
That moment when you catch someone singing @BrooklynDecker https://t.co/619H8AMbfK
@seanfarmer  you da man Farmer !
@JordanSpieth  get me one when you go .....
Sure thing.... Consider them included  https://t.co/IQBE9QFyrT
@ryanharrison92 @SJohnson_89      That's actually a great point .....
@SJohnson_89  ... you should sue USC for only letting you play 4 years. It puts way too much pressure on people getting older... Insensitive
I'm gonna drink on the job and then sue you if/when you fire me .... #Merica
Excited to join @MariaSharapova &amp; Friends @UCLA Dec 12-13 to take on @KeiNishikori &amp; many others. Tix on sale at https://t.co/mgZVYEWXLD
Wow https://t.co/pTAZDf78CM
I love this .....    https://t.co/RmDPdI5yAF
@mrBobbyBones  you are so full of shit hahaha
@1LondonPaul @Starbucks    I might sell my stock .... You have to be responsible for a fair amount of net profits .....
. @JRBlake @MardyFish @JohnIsner @BassProShops     I get it.......   Cause you're tall ......
@Aaronk28  just to clarify. I'm not in the business of ranking the single all time best performance. Those were you words.   It's up there
@Aaronk28 @maryam_tennis    You would know best :)
@Aaronk28 @maryam_tennis  there is no script in sports ... You play who happens to be across from you that day. I'll choose positivity
@Aaronk28 @maryam_tennis  So 11-0 against Fed and Novak would have been more impressive? Thank God for new information .....
If you're shopping on Cyber Monday, go check out what my friends at @travismathew have going on..... https://t.co/TzdgNSKp4F
@maryam_tennis  It absolutely was. 8-0 in singles and 3-0 in dubs for Murray.  How was it not one of the best performances ever in D Cup?
Really impressive from @andy_murray. One of the best Davis Cup years in history ......
@JRBlake @BrooklynDecker @MardyFish    They don't teach that at Harvard     .....
@BrooklynDecker @MardyFish   Or that .......
@MardyFish @BrooklynDecker    I was making coffee when I saw her tweet .......   I tweeted back and then took her her coffee...... Duh
@BrooklynDecker    harmonizing is giving ourselves a bit of credit .....
@israelmartin @darrenrovell       That'd be a tough find ......
@darrenrovell  understood.You said that already.Point being his stance will remain the same just based on wanting to keep the insurance
@darrenrovell  that's fine, but he will retain the right to be paid while on the job search .....
@darrenrovell  on the record he will "want to come back" ..... About 15 million reasons why that will remain his stance publicly
@TopTennisCapper   More referring to your point that I was destroyed by Djoko.I have a winning record against him. Facts are facts ......
@TopTennisCapper @Tennis    I think they're both worthy. They didn't ask me to write about Djoko .....  And your tweet just isn't factual
@packersinsider @SInow @jon_wertheim fair point but I don't think that's corrected by looking over tennis again w two great candidates !
@ClayTravisBGID    End game is that they're seemingly done w him.  His talent needs to exceed potential headaches/attention.  It doesn't
@alex_ritter13 @areshello @richarddeitsch @SInow   I'm fairly certain I'm not on salary anywhere and am within rights to write my thoughts
@alex_ritter13 @areshello @richarddeitsch @SInow    And what job is that exactly?  I would counter that w saying I'm supposed to be honest
@AmerDelic @jon_wertheim  .... And barely that
@ClayTravisBGID  re Manziel.... You don't think it changes the situation if coach specifically asks you to tone it down on the off week ?
Videos can be old .... Except when the song in the background was released earlier this year .....
@crosscourt1     Glad to see the PC police out in force this morning .....
@pchristensen34  agreed that he is certainly deserving as well....   I put a lot of stock in the historical significance of Serena's year
@joshswanson1  that too
@BrainGameTennis @AmerDelic   If only there was time to to think about all of that while also playing a point, then everyone's a genius
@AmerDelic @BrainGameTennis  trust that the BH approach isn't a great option either. If only matches were won beforehand w pencil &amp; paper
That moment when you're waiting in line at the smoothie shop and you watch the same video of your kid 14 times in a row .....
Impressive googling Carl .....  https://t.co/1Od9GevdSc
@CarlBialik @richarddeitsch  the only reason I retired is that I knew I'd have a losing record against Djoko if I kept playing ......   :)
@TRAVISMATHEW @MardyFish @MPG    I will trade Mardy as a friend for MPG
This is heartbreaking to watch ....   Thoughts w Paris
@MardyFish @JRBlake   True. Otherwise we would have thought he was being serious. Much better when you explain the joke. (Sarcasm font)

I like how announcers at WS keep referencing booth replay in New York.Not to be confused w where they are playing the game of course ... NY
@ClayTravisBGID   I want to say something terrible to you re your Nebraska tweet. Instead I'm left w shaking my head and sighing ...
@Verly32 @JustinVerlander @MoRings42   Those times that you get heckled ...... And then you go through a profile and feel better
@Royschach51 much like this debate, people don't tune into tennis to see umpires ......
@tellmegreyseal  more of a reference to them interrupting an answer that hasn't gone over time to prove their own points .....
I didn't tune in tonight to hear the moderators talk over candidates ........
@TommyPaul1 @JRBlake @willblumberg   Nope .... It's scratch your head while being confidently confused
@TommyPaul1 @JRBlake @willblumberg   Nailed it .....
@sportsreiter  a little less for you #bandwagonRoyalsfan
@sportsreiter truth hurts my friend
This .....  https://t.co/Wy8ZSpZeZ9
. @sportsreiter    Good thing for you is now you can seamlessly jump to Royals bandwagon ...    Convenient

@GolfDigest regarding Pistorius... How does a murderous 18 handicap plan to cash in playing golf? Gotta think that's not a market ......
This.....  https://t.co/2l95Qj5S5v
. @ClaireyyM @ChampionsTennis   Good question.........
@bobbyatx @jay_jaffe  and they're also now out of the playoffs ......  Thanks for the attempted correction
. @chrissyteigen @johnlegend   Thank god!   I'm horrible at secrets hahaha......... Can't wait!
@joshswanson1 haha...... Not my sickness though.... It's my future sickness from the lady next to me on flight sneezing on me haha
@MRusselltennis I'm afraid that moment in time has passed haha ..... Good news is that to combat her cough she's crushing straight whiskey
Cough, sniffle, sneeze...... Cough cough sniffle sneeze twice......
Followed by that moment where it's all over and someone sits down there .............   And starts coughing ...... F*** !
That moment on a Southwest flight where the middle seat in your row is open and you are just willing people to walk on by .......
@IamTimCurry that sounded weird
Dear Fantasy Football Team,    Feel free to score a point today at any moment. Just one will work for now
@MardyFish  no
. @JRBlake welcome to TwitterJimmy Blake!  No better person to help w this issue ......
@1LondonPaul  and they almost spelled my name right!
Tirico is so good at his job ... Tennis one day, golf the next.  Let's throw in some Monday night football.  Always a seamless transition
I wrote that last tweet too soon. It got better.  If only everyone took him as seriously as he takes himself  https://t.co/j0FlW0NC5i
Hahahaha.   This isn't real right?   https://t.co/vlgoOMt05z
. @chrissyteigen You're lucky it's not 3 days. Games on Thursday and Monday nights too.  Not to mention college Saturday's..You sound lucky
I do too, and I'm pretty certain he does as well haha  https://t.co/dKEHEBv43A
@1LondonPaul @paulslittle   Finally ....... Getting some credit
@1LondonPaul  the moon doesn't get enough credit
@TheRule8618 @drewbrees @mrBobbyBones @ben_baer    Time will tell I guess.  Eligible soon enough.
This new extra point is awesome .....
Fiorina is like .... I'm Michael, you're Tito
I would like you all to be honest as long as it matches my opinion ....
I'm offended by people being so easily offended ......
Wow!  How cool was that?   Talk about walking off in style ....
@GabriellaQ76  also not happy haha
Incredible matches at the #USOpen today! @GreyGoose is celebrating the day's #WinningShot as only they could. http://t.co/YPmts2gKKa #ad
@_MarioBass @Oyama_Dyosiba @sledge13   And they shouldn't ....
I can't read Italian but I'm pretty sure I'm getting cussed out in it pretty frequently right now :)
@EleanorAlys  it does revolve around history and the pursuit of it. I'd feel the same way if it was someone from another country. Fun to see
Couldn't agree more....  https://t.co/8GBzNnFzai
@copenzo   Absolutely a fair comment.... I'm not gonna sit here and try to convince you it was great
. @sledge13  my point exactly... There was a ton of interest from outside of the tennis world which directly benefits the tennis world...
@CakeEater12  I think it'd be impossible not to feel it
It's possible to appreciate people for earning a place in the final,and at the same moment wonder how it will affect bottom line/interest..
@El_Chupacabron  no disrespect at all, but we are fooling ourselves if we are saying they bought them to see this matchup ...
Those people who bought women's finals tickets .......
" yes, bitch!!! ".  Hahhahahaha.  Did anyone else get that???
Keep an eye out for tomorrow’s #WinningShot to be a part of the @GreyGoose #USOpen private after party at http://t.co/IElpHMylRY #ad
@Favor_ATX   We have tried. Unfortunately you don't deliver to our area ....
. Dear @tacodeli ...  Why had we never met before today? What has been keeping us apart?  Let's be together forever from here on out
. @themightygwinn  wrong. The mistake was using excessive force when unnecessary. Given the chance, James would've cooperated .....
James is the most honest and straightforward guy I know. It's ridiculous what happened today......
Fun being on court in NY, celebrating what makes an extraordinary #WinningShot, past and present, with @GreyGoose http://t.co/7j0GUpolO8
@EJohnsonMPLS    Hahaha.... And then I clicked to see who was heckling me....
This is seriously high level stuff ....
@donannemitchell @AmerDelic  is that how it works?
You eat pieces of shit for breakfast? #shooter
Anyone else see Shooter Mcgavin behind Murray when he returns on ad side?   #Shooter
@BeautYdUde probably not .... Only cause in one case, we are talking about amateur athletics .....
@mrBobbyBones  I'm sure we can find some middle ground .... Nobody wants to hear me sing
@Y4LYFE @byuROC   Nailed it .... BYU is now the greatest of all time.....
@mrBobbyBones   Can we come?
Nice of you to say. Thanks for watching!  https://t.co/i6uLqV0o5B
I hope we kept the receipt .....
Paid a million dollars .....  To lose....  To BYU
We (Nebraska) paid BYU money for that ....
I love how D Young is using the NYC crowd to his advantage ....
That's an expensive shadow going across center court .....
@PSchrags   You love Fognini
@JohnIsner that's only your favorite memory because you won ......
@TheSharkDaymond @USTA_Foundation @charitybuzz    I'm gonna win this. I'm gonna pull a Cuban and swoop in at the end ...
@mrBobbyBones hahaha.  Touché...  I might have to call you tomorrow when I can't figure out how it works
I might need to try this periscope deal to talk to you all during some of the U.S. Open matches....
@Gee_Renee @StarJonesEsq @serenawilliams  ... Cause I didn't speak my mind when I was playing? Not true in the slightest...Uninformed
Mannarino can play as well as he wants.....  His legs are gonna get tested for the next couple hours.  Far from over
@ItsMikeHill  vindicated by a technicality ....
@KB_PhD @ComplexMag   She shouldn't .... If you broke something that you owned, could someone charge you for that?   :)
. @MardyFish only weird part is that it's still morning..... But besides that I'm w it.... Margarita time
This ...... http://t.co/n9lzoNGzqg
. @MardyFish  hell of an effort my friend... I couldn't be prouder ..... Time for that margarita #cheers
Looks like standing room only for this second match at night session
@neha_uberoi @si_now I'm proud of you for sharing your story. Saddlebrook seems like a lifetime ago. You're  always a winner Neha !!
@neha_uberoi Neha I read it two weeks ago and had been meaning to reach out.  I had no idea and I love the perspective you've gained ...
Murray is a stud.I hope people realize how massive his tennis IQ is when they are watching him..If I wanted a scouting report he'd be my guy
@ClukheadPope   HMD !!!!!!   Hope you are well brotha!
@richarddeitsch ... currently unemployed .....  You have any connections or leads for me?   :)
So much fun watching how simple and automatic @lleytonhewitt backhand is.. We tend to want flashy shots. I'll take function and reliability
@wayne_inc     No. He's done for the day. Don't see him getting rid of these
Why does nobody ever talk about how important diet can be when you're prone to cramping?  Hydration obviously huge factor .... Diet is also
@MiKaDiAnNe  a little itch and a comeback are two entirely different things haha ....
@usopen   No :)
Love seeing that effort from @Yimlife1313 !  Awesome.....
@joshswanson1  then I would definitely need the luck ....
That awkward moment when you're walking down the street in NYC and someone says "good luck in the tournament"
“@Coastal_CDD: @andyroddick Wish you were a commentator at the U.S. Open”  Maybe someday .....
Hell yeah Fishy! @MardyFish
“@darrenrovell: Sharapova out is bad for AMEX, but not as bad as 10 years ago when Andy Roddick "lost his mojo" in the 1st round” ... My bad
I could (do) watch @SharkTankABC for 10 hours a day .......
@ESPNTennis   Incorrect
Let's celebrate my birthday this week &amp; make a difference by donating to the @theARFoundation 15th year fund http://t.co/RbN4zRZBVp Thanks!
@fred_staebler  and you're sure I couldn't have tweeted that from the other side of the security line?
That guy who sneezes directly onto your back in the security line at the airport .....
That moment when friends you're very close to and have loved for a long time, tell you they bought a selfie stick on vacation ... #decisons
@danazilber @usopen   Im not ... We will see what happens in the future. I would need a network to reach out and make a deal first :)
You know you're getting older when your friend calls ... " I can't go on the boat today cause I'm waiting to pass a kidney stone "
So good  https://t.co/hKZgyvydCY
@4petehsake @sportsreiter Said a lot of things, but that wasn't the reason hahaha.   @FOXSports is first class. Was time to move on .....
@WhyWhitneyWhy @sportsreiter  my time at Fox has come to an end. I Had a blast and am thankful for opportunity. Future of pod up in air ...
@EricEdmeades  we view my responsibility differently.I view it as being honest and providing insight based on what I'm watching.
@NickGillen89   I probably said some things I shouldn't have.......  Not close to that though
@EricEdmeades   I should just lie instead??
@EricEdmeades  so by your logic, when I'm asked a direct question, instead of paying respects audibly first, and then giving my opinion ....
@EricEdmeades context is important.I would love to be wrong.I am a massive Rafa fan, and hope I'm wrong. I will always be honest w opinions
@BrooklynDecker   Shit......   Well played. #timetogeteven
@FTiafoe   Great job at The Zoo bud!  Keep it rolling!
@SWetzelND   Not sure.... Let me make a phone call to tennis.....

Watching this kid Zverev play in DC is as impressed as I've been w a young player in a long time ......
. @happyslamtennis  Thank you so much for this. I had a blast. It was a pleasure to share the court w my dear friend @MardyFish a last time
. @BBTatlantaopen   Can we get some towels on the practice courts?   Too hot .... Too much sweat .... Court 3 please
@LuRendy  very nice of you my friend!  You will always have won our biggest match :)        Continued success!!
. @TimShriver   You're a rockstar Tim. Been watching.  Inspiring and pure ...... Kudos !
@lynney62    And you're also taking away any credibility you might have by taking cheap shots at my pregnant wife.Sleep well....... I will
@lynney62  I would be the first to admit Rafa is great. Agree w all of your points ... Humor is also part of my DNA. All in good fun. Cheers
Goodell agrees w the decision Goodell made ..... People everywhere are shocked.... Let's break that down for the next 4 days       Awesome
@FTiafoe Enjoyed it bud!  Let's hit it around again soon ..... Good luck!

@redturn2 @KershsChallenge I'll be in Atlanta! You gotta give me more notice next time Turner.To practice, and to grow a weird looking beard

@1LondonPaul  to be fair, you can spit on a Waffle House from pretty much anywhere is Georgia. It's one of my favorite things ...
Congrats to @djokernole for sponsoring the Serbian team for Special Olympics ..... Classy classy move... Can't wait for these games!
@leighsaxon looking forward to playing ..... I'll be the guy that's sweating, tired, and trying not to cramp haha
@AustinElrod4  enjoyed it Austin. We will take a walk around BACC again soon!
Couldn't be happier for @ZachJohnsonPGA ...  One of the good ones

@KM_621 @ESPN_Colin @sportsreiter   Why supplanting?  You're making the gross assumption that I liked Bill at some point
. @ESPN_Colin  So am I now allowed to say you're my favorite guy on sports radio ?
Is this the part where Rafter isn't allowed to be negative?
Sports
@MillardPeter at which point he would put a tie on
@MillardPeter he wasn't in the Royal Box
Remember that one time that @JordanSpieth made a bad decision? .........    I don't either
@GaryLineker   Even when the invite says "please wear a jacket and tie?" ... This obnoxious American is ok w it.
@Barry487 tough one .......    How about "a picture" ?
I still think it's weird when grown men say "selfie"
Farewell London. Big thanks to @bbctennis for the opportunity!   Til I see you again @Wimbledon .....
I am horrible at tying a tie.  My apologies to classy people everywhere #Wimbledon #canttieatie
Finals day!   Shockingly I feel a little more relaxed than other finals Sundays I've participated in haha. Excited for the day ! @bbctennis
@MsMolly8 @Wimbledon @bbctennis @AndrewCastle63    Not nearly as confident after seeing Roger's performance yesterday
Will be an honor to call @Wimbledon final tomorrow @bbctennis. Looking forward to an afternoon w @AndrewCastle63, T Henman, and all of you!
@Manqondo3    Or both
An athlete can't be punished because they have made us expect it from them......    21 and counting.... @serenawilliams
If @serenawilliams didn't just lock up every major sports award for the year, I quit trying to understand the process.
“@serenawilliams: I hear @andyroddick said I'm already thinking about the U.S. Open 5 mins ago? Ummm Andy you are 20 mins late 😜”  Congrats!
@ChampionsTennis   Enjoyed myself last year for sure.  My invite for this year got lost in the mail I think .........
Sat down w @rogerfederer to get his thoughts on the final ahead @wimbledon. Keep watching @bbctennis  to see! http://t.co/DK20DtIYKM

@DickLongYo @BBCSportScot @darren_cahill    ....  Says the guy who spells it "grammer" when correcting my grammar .....
@jsoverend @bbc5live @BBCOne    Appreciate it but in all fairness I took the first 9 days of the tournament off haha
@ClaireyyM  Djoko match on radio .....  Murray/Fed on TV
@TommyPaul1   In all seriousness I really enjoyed it .. Thanks for waking up early to hit w an old man before your doubles
@TommyPaul1   "Yeah right".        Roddick -1 ......  Paul - 0
“@nbariver: Here’s Mark Cuban Challenging Chris Broussard To Produce Proof Of His Reports. http://t.co/tFFjnZmH8A”... This is hilarious
Apparently "pissed off" is considered cussing on TV here in London?      Who knew? I have no chance ........ Zero

Enjoyed my day @Wimbledon today w @bbctennis !   Now a couple of of segments for my bosses back across the pond @FOXSports1, then to bed...
Takeaway from Wimby ...  I thought match between @serenawilliams and @vika7 was the highest quality women's match I've seen in awhile
@DavidLawTennis @sportsreiter come on David.  Bill is an intimidating presence, but you can't pass up an opportunity to talk to him
@jamEYYoo @bbctennis @Wimbledon  looks like the Djoko/Cilic match

@Jwesto  those guys on Twitter who have it all figured out as long as they don't have to do it :)
“@1LondonPaul: Let's all give the #moon some credit.... http://t.co/DSfEOKDHoJ”   It never gets enough credit....... Sun this, sun that
You just can't make some stuff up
@honesgirl he should be fined.. My entire point wasn't a defense of his actions. More along the lines of betting that nobody changed channel
Will start w @bbctennis next Wednesday for those asking... Excited to cover quarters, semis, finals as well as studio and radio work !!
@scoobstennis @stevegtennis It will be there.... For better or worse :)
@phil4321566    Thanks pal ...  As you were
@phil4321566 which is a complete counter to where you started this conversation
@stevegtennis  Yes...... I am
@phil4321566 I wouldn't. It was wrong... You're still talking about it though... Was my only point. Wasn't defending it at all
@stevegtennis Not true in the slightest. I've seen them firsthand at power shares tour this year in every city....
“@phil4321566: @sirbenson3 @aussierules13 Freedom of speech...” From your timeline 33 minutes ago..... Like the wind blows
@phil4321566 @stevegtennis  ok so we are shaming everyone who has used the F word before ?   Stones and glass houses.
@stevegtennis   What I agree w people doing and what rates are different. Moral policing versus what is entertaining .... No defense.
New @FOXSportsLive pod w @sportsreiter   https://t.co/0s0JJk1AJq
@JennyRyan01  start next week. I will be on starting Wednesday
@Clare_109 @FOXSportsLive @sportsreiter literally recording one right now .....
@kayla_surfs ...  Either spelling will suffice. I got your back #spellingpolice http://t.co/HlS3ePscK2
All of my respect to @lleytonhewitt ... Enjoyed our battles. You did it the right way everyday ... #cmon
@Shayan86 next week
@KMillar15 could be worse.  You could be stuck between 2 dudes and not be wearing an awesome shirt ... @TRAVISMATHEW
. @ClayTravisBGID @JustinColeMoore    Remember that time when Clay got exactly the reaction he wanted?
@jonmorosi @sportsreiter @Ken_Rosenthal   And they can guarantee All Star selections also.... No other team can offer that #Infante
Hate this for DJ ....... Unreal theater to finish
Wow
Just insane how clutch that 3 wood was .... Unreal #speith
@jayham63 I promise I would
I just can't take the saying "tough walk" seriously
@loribrew636 @FOXSportsLive   If the players getting voted in by any fan base were hitting .204, I would feel the exact same
https://t.co/K1zVKz7wze new @FOXSportsLive pod where Bill and I talk Royal takeover of MLB All Star game!
@danieljpress @sportsreiter   Infante must be playing the best defense that's ever been played in the history of sports #mendozaline
@DominicMalnar @Royals   You're right.. Let me sit in front of my computer and click and re click .. That's how to determine who's deserving
@hulljacob yes I do....
. @VentWithVenton @sportsreiter    You're right .... Infante is worse
. @sportsreiter     I can't wait to not be watching when Alcides Escobar starts the All Star game. #byebyefanvote
@tennisntn @usta @MardyFish @BBTatlantaopen  he will.... Mostly because his backhand doesn't suck
@gators72 it doesn't
@souji5 didn't mean to ........ Fixed
@AnthonySantino @MardyFish @BBTatlantaopen only when I'm too out of shape and past my prime to play singles..... #now
... @sportsreiter  thoughts on 8 Royals currently projected to start MLB All Star game? It's gonna end up taking away fan vote ... Watch
@brianperkinstx @TimJen23 ..... Correct :)
Hit serves yesterday for first time in a month.Can't lift my arm today. Work to be done before @BBTatlantaopen next month! Haha @MardyFish
@bgtennisnation yes.  That's exactly what it is
@chute75llc  actually, worst case scenario, Lebron will have two rings at the end of these Finals ..... Hate to argue using facts
Lebron saying he's the best in the world is like Manziel saying he might have partied too much ..... We know this..... Man
Nobody likes Steph more than I do.. That being said, why exactly are we mad at Lebron for saying he's the best best player in the world?
Play of the game so far is Green not responding physically to that ridiculous play by Smith
. @rogerfederer @Wimbledon  Hopefully it will be easier to talk about you, than it was to play against you :)
@jason_tahir    I work for the other company.   @FOXSportsLive
@Jrrbfb @sportsreiter you're gonna have to learn to spell it correctly first ....
@_PinkPapillon_ @TennisChannel @ESPNTennis @espn   You forgot to add @BBCSport .....
@darrenrovell or the fact that it was actually a destination race.... I watched in a crowded bar. Would have never gone out for it normally
Well deserved .... Went out and beat him.  Wow
Stick save
Likes T here
Chance for Novak .... Again, first serves needed ...
Besides the second serve S and V, Novak did zero wrong that game ... Connors used to tell me "operation successful, patient died".
I hate the serve and volley on second there
Two backhand winners this game from Stan from well behind baseline.  One down line. One cross.  Pick your poison ....
Almost impossible to defend down the line if Stan is taking massive cuts and landing them ....
Clutch serving by Stan  ...    Impossible to keep Novak neutral if you're hitting too many second serves
Out of nowhere a couple of loose shots by Stan ....  He needs first serves to save these break points
It's amazing how hard these guys are hitting the ball without high amounts of errors.  It's like a guy batting 350 and hitting 60 homers
Wow
These two guys look like they're playing video games.  Unreal tennis. #frenchopen
https://t.co/h38PcGFRCK @foxsportslive pod w @sportsreiter and my father in law... Proceed w caution!!
Take a second and say it out loud.@RafaelNadal has won 9 French Opens.Cant take those away.Perfectly executed match by @DjokerNole. Props!
@Stevietennis and Steve J from two days ago!
Really impressive stuff from @JohnIsner and @JackSock !  Keep it rolling boys!
@BrettHaber @rolandgarros  I don't but I'm happy to give a percentage of whatever you can negotiate !
@BobbyBonesRay @FOXSportsLive ... Bae
So I got a little heated in new @FOXSportsLive pod w @sportsreiter  https://t.co/nfJByFIla7
Thanks to @OU_MTennis for a great season! I haven't missed many this year on livestream! Proud of the way you guys battled. #nextyear
@OU_MTennis Hell yes!! Survive and advance!
@LenKee_ @justingimelstob better than never having had one ...  #cheersgimel
@sportsreiter @vicfeelingyou Vic kind of looks like The Macho Man today #snapittoaslimjim
New @FOXSportsLive podcast w my friend "Judgement Mike" as he discusses athletes who want to destroy https://t.co/AEouNNBT2f
What have we learned today? Zero... Patriots deflated balls and Brady was most likely aware.... Did you hear we landed on the moon?
@jaredstoltzsays @sportspickle @The_Fermaniack  it could be worse.... I could be blogging
New @FOXSportsLive pod w @1LondonPaul !  https://t.co/atFAZlnZQo
@andy_murray @BrooklynDecker    ......   Murray ......   Hide
Who wins in a fight between @Keegan_Bradley and Jimenez??? .........   DITKA
. I wish @Keegan_Bradley would have laid him out. Bush league from Jimenez to question drop in a meaningless match @TRAVISMATHEW #teamTM
@CurryFormvp30 @MollyMcGrathFS1  its a good thing I took a screen grab of your old one..  #NeverForget http://t.co/LpHfY159TW
@CurryFormvp30 thanks for the follow :)
@CurryFormvp30 @MollyMcGrathFS1  priceless that your bio states your support for S. Curry MVP 2016...Nothing like planning ahead. #RollTide
. @MollyMcGrathFS1  I'm sure Stephen A would argue that they "provoked" him as well ..... This sounds familiar .....
@FriscoSquid @JustinVerlander  not used for anything like court etc, but would go a long way for a given persons public perception.
@PatWalkerWX @aaronnolannews @KARK4News      Persistent is the word I was thinking of .....
@aaronnolannews @PatWalkerWX @KARK4News .. to be fair it was during the interview ...... And post interview ......
@blessenv @iptl     would have loved to... I didn't get drafted
. @JackSock good work this week!  Keep it rolling
Had a blast watching @JordanSpieth this weekend !   Quality all around. Congrats!
Happy Birthday to my wonderful wife @BrooklynDecker ..... I love you!!
Proud to know Ben Crenshaw ... Classy in every way ... Austin's best !
When your Über driver goes "32 years old now? Weren't you way too young to retire?"
@aaronnolannews @jodymcd  ... No
@ClayTravisBGID @RyanFieldFS1  yeah!!   Football!!!   America!!!!!   ......      Rory is already a legend. He's 25.....

@MattyFresh61 @kellyinvegas @ToddFuhrman    Nobody calls you that
@MattyFresh61 @kellyinvegas @ToddFuhrman    Take it easy Fresh....  Can I call you Fresh?
@kellyinvegas I told you Kansas would dominate
Upset of the day.... @ClayTravisBGID just said "I'm officiating a wedding in Alabama"..He was serious......... Mind blown
@ClayTravisBGID @kellyinvegas good news is I'm pretty sure I've lost less money than Clay learning this very valuable lesson
@ClayTravisBGID @kellyinvegas   By the end of the day we could know two things as absolute certainty ... Gravity and Georgia never covering
@kellyinvegas @ClayTravisBGID it's funny cause Kelly was mad at me on air for "taking her pick" ....
Congrats @70jmoses for winning the http://t.co/GiqPQLAhns prize! I look forward to meeting you in LA soon!! Thanks to everyone who donated!

@andrewikesports my feelings are that he's a douchebag and I hate that he has a US flag next to his name when he's cheating. Good riddance
