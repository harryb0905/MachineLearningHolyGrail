Struggles are part of life, because in order to stand up, you have to know what falling down is like.
Always look forward, and never look back. When you're caught staring at the past you miss out on what the future holds.
Remember the past,  plan for the future,  but live for today,  because yesterday is gone  and tomorrow may never come.

✋RT @itsMissMORGAN: @DeJuan45 they can also remind why some ppl r best left in the past. Lol
Giving up doesn’t always mean you are weak; sometimes it means that you are strong enough to let go.
Look you don’t need a certain number of friends, just a number of friends you can be certain of.
Over thinking makes life harder.
80% of people remain quiet even when they really want to say something in order to avoid an argument with someone they care about.
Psychology says, pretending not to care only makes things worse. Avoiding something makes you think about it more.
Old text messages can often remind you of how things used to be.
✋✋✋RT @POP_Drizz: I NEVER HATED ON YALL
I don't have regrets &amp; wouldn't change a thing because it made me who I am today.
Forget what's gone. Appreciate what remains. Look forward to what's coming.

Don't strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
Never catch me trippin over what ain't mine.
I don't need that many people around me. I'm good by myself.
Pay attention to people's reactions when shit get real.
I don't chase after anyone anymore.
I was doing just fine before you came, I think I’ll be fine now that you’re gone.
Fake is the latest trend. Be different, be real.
I've learned that nobody really cares about your problems as much as they say they do.

What's real doesn't fade away.
What comes easy, won't always last, and what will last, won't always come easy.
Be the type of person you want to meet.
Everything is going to be alright, maybe not today, but eventually.

I'm not the person I used to be. I admit, a lot of shit got to me.
People immediately hate what they don't understand.
Something I learned about people... If they do it once, they'll do it again.
I never needed you, I wanted you, there's a difference.
Sometimes, what we want isn't what's best for us..

Can't make everybody happy I tried and that shyt DO NOT WORK!
No matter how good you are to people... there will always be people criticizing you.
This will be the best year yet.
Appreciate every moment you have now.
Don't look back... or you'll trip over what's infront of you.
It is, what it is...
We met for a reason. Either you were a blessing or a lesson!!
Trust few, Forget the rest.
I may not be perfect, but shyt at least I know who I am.
Never expect, assume, or demand. Let it be. If it's meant to be, it'll happen.
Surround yourself with people who make you better, not bitter.
MNothing ever comes easy.
Stop stressing over things u can't change! And start working towards things u can! Salute

@tashababygirlx I'm not talking bout them lol
U can't judge nobody!
It's easy to believe someone when they’re telling you exactly what you wanna hear.
Find someone who will change your life, not just your status.
I stay to myself ALOT!

Yup so hard to find smh RT @Porsche_Foxx: “@DeJuan45: Loyalty is rare... If you find it, keep it.🙌”
Same 2 u RT @BRILLZ062: @DeJuan45 hope all is well my brotha .
Money is the motivation 💸
Sometimes you have to let go of what's gone, appreciate what remains, and look forward to what's next.
Loyalty is rare... If you find it, keep it.🙌
I distance myself from people for a reason.
Never be afraid to start over.. it's a new chance to rebuild what you want.
Some people I'm kinda glad I'm not close to anymore.
Never trust somebody who deals  wit everybody...💯
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it.
Once I stop caring about you, good luck getting that back.
Just leave it alone, if it's meant to be, it will happen.
Maturity comes with experience, not age..
I over analyze too much sometimes...
Somebody out here don't like me! SO WAT THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM! Lol 😜💯
I remember when we didn't use our phones now these social sites got us good! ✋📖😂😂😂😜
Turn up!

"It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways."
Don't advertise a life you don't live on social networks.
Nobody wants to hear this, but sometimes…the person you want most is the person you're best without.
Pleasing people will not get you where you need to be in life. Listen go me!
Stop making life a competition. Becoming a better person than them do you no good if doesn't birth a better version of you.

Do what you have to do now so you can do what you want to do later.
Keep the Faith. The most amazing things in life tend to happen right at the moment you're about to give up hope.
Sometimes the best revenge is just a simple smile, to let them know you're doing good.
Dont let circumstances you cant control, control your happiness.
Live each day like it was your last. The past is gone and tomorrow isn't guaranteed. 💯
Put God first and you'll never be last.
Some people don't know what they have, and how lucky they are.  Goodmorning twittfam have a wonderful day!!✋📖💯

Lose the argument, not the person.
I don't trust words, I trust actions.
A problem is only as big as you make it.
Not everyone around you is your friend.
Be thankful for what you have.
There's "hell" in hello, "good" in goodbye, "lie" in believe, "over" in lover, "end" in friend, "ex" in "next", &amp; "if" in life.
This is what i live for.

Sometimes people don't change, their priorities do.
Only a few people care. The rest are just curious.
People haven't always been there for me, but basketball always has.
Stop worrying about what others want. Think about what you want
Dear God, thank you for this beautiful life, and forgive me for everything that I have done wrong..

Too many people in the world to let just ONE keep you down.
Loyalty isn't about those who act true to your face, it's about those who remain true behind your back.
People change, feelings fade, heart broken, friends leave, friends become enemies, lovers become strangers, you’ll be judged, life goes on.
