A little pre-show Hall and Oates backstage at the House of Blues. @311 https://t.co/u2sVzBNJHJ
@bradlyaolson @gibsonguitar That’s a sustainer pickup.  Like a built in EBow.  Makes for otherworldly sounds.
Uplift in Guadalajara https://t.co/HsedKEld1M
Happy travelers https://t.co/RkblhIr31N
@DarienSaiidifar That’s right!  Love that thing.  I use a Blue Box for the solo at the end of Too Much to Think.
In case you can’t tell I’m trying to get back into twitter after months of hibernation.  Here’s a pic of today’s guitar practice setup in my hotel room.  The travel guitar fits in my suitcase. https://t.co/WUUOYOp1Yd
I’ve had bad dreams where I got on stage and didn’t know the song.  Or forgot to put on pants.
That Fyre Fest doc gave me mad anxiety. To see those people show up and be so disappointed to the point of disbelief is the stuff of nightmares. I’m happy that we’ve thrown well over 20 special events and not a single disaster yet!
Today marks the first day of touring season in the new year. Happy to be getting out and about. Been in studio/home mode. First stop, Guadalajara!
@moose_jr378 @311 @TabernacleATL Thanks for sharing that! Made us happy. @pnut
@KellieCNN @alexbaker @311 @amandaelaine @pnut My condolences. 🙏🏼 I’m glad 311 brought her some solace.
SA getting down on the mic at my place. #311 https://t.co/9lA03mYrdh
Whoever made this, well done. https://t.co/bFw53ViCUf
@RySchwei88 I agree
@bbbprinting @owhmusicguy @DaveElsesser @OWHnews @311 @pnut And new Uplifter products available at a nearby dispensary!  If all goes as planned.  Announcement coming.
I just texted Scotch Ralston to see how it was going with Tim at the  Hive.  He sent me this vid and of them “doing guitars.”  😂 https://t.co/ikvhXJoulg
Warmest of holiday wishes to the entire 311 community. I’m so grateful for family, friends, and the creative life I get to live today. Enjoy today with your loved ones!
@jesserpearson @gibsonguitar Modification

@ericbobo Hey Bobo!!!
@beefarino The circular reasoning holds up
This video shows the perils of letting your kids listen to popular music. I suppose it’s payback for the curse words in 311 albums! 🤣 https://t.co/9MHCcCbVnF

@XFGxNova @mcreavis Right
Hi 👋🏼
It’s a beautiful night in south Florida for a concert on the beach! Let’s do this. 🏖
#Grateful Happy Thanksgiving!🦃🍽
@jamesbvalentine Thanks man! Super stoked for you guys. Rock on
Yo @jamesbvalentine enjoying your @ernieball special! I relate with so much of it.
@mcreavis Something about a torture technique
@TheezGoToEleven I didn’t know I was making a Simpsons reference but I believe it. Ingrained into my psyche.
So good to be home. The chickens were so thirsty they nearly gouged my eyes to drink my sweet eyeball fluid.  👀 5 days camping out at dad’s studio. It was a long evacuation. Thank you to the firefighters!
@omahabolt @butchwalker Thanks buddy
The Hexum family is safely evacuated from the fire zone. Waiting for the heroic firefighters to give us the all clear to return. Thank you 🙏🏼
@ronjohnson79 @311 @Cannabis_Voter @pnut Haha
Enjoyed voting today. Harlow went with me and was fascinated by the process. 🗳
@JonahsDad311 @311 @pnut Yes! ✌🏼
Happy Halloween! Here’s me and Scott Ian being fundads at the carnival. Have fun tonight! https://t.co/4AvDFzCKoC
@gregoryisrael Rad
The John Scofield show in LA a couple nights ago was transcendent. Still my fav guitarist. Check out A Go Go or Uberjam 1 and 2. So funky. Had a chance to tell him of 311’s appreciation for his work. 🙏🏼🎸
I am glad there are more running playlists springing up on the streaming services. So much more fun to run in time to a beat. Here’s three happy runners at the top of a mountain. https://t.co/AME5NoicQk
thank you for the suggestion.  the mountain lion sounds are working nicely.  not sure what they were doing when the clip was recorded but it sounded fun
@dvits14 done
Went running today and had an idea that I'm really excited to demo up.  I probably look weird stopping to sing into my phone but that's ok.  It's only mountain lions watching.
@cwil91 It’s the combo of a thrill plus being one with nature. Warning: it’s very addictive. 🌊
I upgraded from a soft board to fiberglass today. 🏄 May get to try it tomorrow. Waves were good today but it was so windy. 💨
To the construction worker who scraped the side of my brand new Tesla with your equipment, no worries. Stuff happens. Thanks for your honesty. ✌🏼
To the burglar who cleaned out my car while I was surfing, you suck. 🖕🏼
@STPRobertDeLeo really good show last night. Let’s do more!
Watching @deftones from side of stage
@gldnt_king @pnut Look at @pnut ‘s awesome chops.
@JonahsDad311 was gonna get a 8 ft Wavestorm from costco next!
Caught some waves early this morning in Malibu. Conditions were just right for me. Medium size waves and not crowded. Then the sun came out and it was so beautiful. #Inspiration https://t.co/hMwRaGdZ74
Had a really good band meeting yesterday where we decided on a path to continue the record. We’re super psyched! Not going to rush tho. Sorry that our earlier estimates were a bit too ambitious. Creativity and quality is top priority. Thanks for patience! #311 🎶
@RLGwood @pnut @311 🙏🏼
@mdeponte311 @pnut Didn’t end up getting sore surprisingly
@mdeponte311 @pnut Dope
Got back on the water today. First time surfing since July. My watch said I burned 1200 calories. My upper back is gonna be so sore from all the paddling. 10 good rides! 🏄 #Malibu
@lemanski311 @311 @pnut No comma.  Looks great!
It’s poker night with the other local dads! I should do okay after honing my skills with the @GymClassHeroes boys all summer! They were real good. @mattydookis ♦️ ♥️
@MattONeil_books @311 @pnut You have now adopted that stream. Please pick up trash monthly. Thanks.
Just a dude on a mountain bike riding the trails near Vail, CO on the last day of tour. Grateful to those who have supported our rock and roll dreams! 🙏🏼 https://t.co/vArCI4ZS3X
@winterwar78 I miss that shirt. I designed that one cuz I had stole a hazmat sign like that off a wall.  Which was not very nice.
@geauxjj48 W/vamp. Meaning we jam on it a while before I start singing 🎤

@ThaRealGrim @pnut I think it’s just us
I’m all over the place with who I root for in football, and all sports really.  I check the computer models and then go with my gut and place a small wager to make it more interesting. It should be legal.
@HWilliamsNFL At least half of us thank you!
🏈
@mnovots I would say it’s an artist rendering of a chaotic sun.
@Mr_AndrewHunt That one was somewhat inspired by the song Cherry oh baby
I get antsy around this time of night on days off.  Body says it’s time to move. I’ll go elliptical in time to some hard ass beats at the hotel gym. 🏃‍♂️
@NickolasYost @311 @pnut Thanks!
@amanda323232 @311 You’re with us in spirit!

@ColinHanks Did I ever tell you about the time I met Joe Strummer and he had a 311 sticker on his boom box?  I couldn’t believe it. Felt like a dream.
I'm watching the Joe Strummer doc The Future is Unwritten for the I don't know how many-eth time. While jamming along on guitar.
Thanks @TheGnudz for rocking the house nightly. Enjoy your break. See u in Hartford!

@MirrorKissesVA Thanks for coming to the show the other day.  I'm enjoying your music on my day off.
Note to self: attach propellors properly or they will fly off and land on top of the bus.  Lovely setting for a @311 show here in Syracuse. Notice the bird that swooped my drone to scare it away. https://t.co/bcTVgm18PH
@kayleemorris222 @311 @pnut 👍🏼👍🏼
@Hydroponic311h @311 @pnut It’s a true co headline bill so it’s a little different this year, set timing wise.  Hope you enjoyed tho

People of Reno, come rock with @311 and @FishboneSoldier tonight!
It’s nice to watch the cup final in 4k. Other sports, you’re late!
@MikeJudge more tales from the tour bus please. We love it!
@DaveStylee @Freakonomics My sister was in the band. We did 80s new wave. We just played in kids basements. Didn’t go very far. It was named after the Clash song just like Stephen J Dubner’s band.
@AmandaJLemaster 😀👍🏼
@Freakonomics here’s to the next few years. Wasn’t sure where you were going with that announcement. Love the show. The name of my first band was also The Right Profile.

@BabydazeMama He just needed a rhyme for funny
@BrianKurinsky I just thought it sounded super tasty. Golden buttered jam.
Well the working title was Off Beat because of the off beat guitar hits but then SA added a rap about how he and Chad had a war where they used to bare ass fart on eachother’s heads when they weren’t looking. We thought it was funny. https://t.co/tZd8aDHnzH
@kroq @kevinandbean @SHAQ @311 Nice find on the footage!
And in case anyone thinks I'm slacking by watching ball in the middle of the day, I was just taking a break from cutting a vocal cuz dude was blowing leaves outside! haha
Just watched last night’s @KingJames block and then buzzer beater. “Just give me the ball.” You gotta give props to a clutch move like that. 🏀 #NBAPlayoffs

The afterglow from #311Day is great.  Ahead of time, we’re thinking about all the stuff we have to remember to do 86 songs.  There’s excitement but also nerves.  After, it’s a lot of high fives. Thank you for all the nice feedback! The 311 Nation rules.

@KidStupendous @311 @pnut That gets funnier every time I read it. I concur
I’m still high on last night’s jam with 3 dudes from @FishboneSoldier. They laid down the “Sleng Teng” riddim to which I️ sang parts of Ring the Alarm, Armagideon Time, All Mixed Up, Under Mi Sleng Teng, and Extension. So fun!
@Loopadoopy Yep. I had a Bigsby put on my strat which is no easy task. Pretty rare. I just had one put on my Tele too!

Morrissey was fantastic. We were fourth row center at the Bowl.  Great acoustics. Could hear the instruments coming straight from the stage rather than through the mains. His voice sounded amazing. It was very moving. I heard he likes Amber but have never met him. One day.
@BrodelTrevor @pnut I️ still remember their song My Four Walls.  And their bass player giving me LSD infused wine
Suedehead and his cover of pretenders back on the chain gang were both stellar. #Morrissey

@AdamNMayer True
I guess it was because the blue album was all rockers. Even sweet and purpose had heavy riffs. Transistor was 50/50 chill/rock
That record was not well received at all at first but it grew on people
It was fun playing 9 Transistor songs tonight on the 20 year anniversary of that album.
Tonight after WWIT I said, "sorry about all the bad words, Mom. But then again… She curses more than me so it's all good!" 😂

Just visited the 9-11 Memorial. Thank you for your service @FDNY
@rymckmaneuver @311 @pnut How's it look? Decent recording?
Dear @ericandre , since you jabbed me in the balls while @311 was performing on your show, you owe me a favor. Follow me so I can DM you! 🍒
@ThePierOrg @311 One and the Same is particularly barn-burning.  If you like burning barns. 👽
That's crazy. Hadn't seen that. It's huge! Prolly more intended for keeping guys company than actually playing cards. 😂 https://t.co/zjNlbCiPak
@jherrick9 @pnut @311 That was awesome.
@ceelo311 Did last night
@MarcDecon Not sure. I do know I got in trouble for flying my drone.
@oneillbp311 Not really
@beachside311 Liftoff and So Glad You Made it, respectively
@joan8904 Not sure. I would guess it can call the elevator or press buttons. No humans were around.
@joan8904 Your phone rings. Pick it up and hear r2d2 noises and "your robot is at your door." I made up reasons to have him keep stopping by.

@AlexLeeDrums I set it to workout, other tonight
@KyleGAdema Not that I remember
But then again my Apple Watch said my average heart rate was 110 when I ran up the Empire State Bld. No way. I thought I might keel over.
It's fun to play a room that has had Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Led Zeppelin, and U2. So much history in Hampton.
My watch says I just burned 860 calories on stage

Thanks so much for all the feedback on Mosaic! Someone said, “Songs to rock out, smoke out, and make out to!”
The final episode of Long Strange Trip was super sad. We debuted Tribute the night Jerry died. 311 went to some of those final Dead shows.

Playing on the Monterey stage Sunday was way cool.  You could still see the singed spot where Hendrix burned his strat in '67.  Iconic.

Made my night to see people rocking out to 311 at the @LAKings game. So I did a stage dive
@LAKings thank you for playing @311 here at Staples! Go Kings!
To me, moshing is dance but crowd surfing is not. Just my opinion
“@LeftyJones3: @NickHexum biggest question. If lawsuits couldn't happen, would you still be doing it?” Probably not. It wasn't very musical.
“@johnoneal: @nickhexum you once elbowed me in the head during a stage dive. It was awesome.” That's the spirit! Haha
Browbeated? Not a word. How about this: I was successfully browbeaten into stopping by our lawyer.
I used to do those crazy stage dives nearly every night. Our lawyer successfully browbeat me into stopping.
@311est I hadn't seen those. Thanks!
@mike311_8 thanks!
@brianbowensmith my neck is super sore from rocking out that hard at yesterday's shoot

In other exciting news, cherry cider is delicious.
Mastering is where they put the final EQ, compression, song sequence, and spacing. Joe Gaswirt has mastered all but 2 of our albums.
The album is done being mixed and now it's being mastered.
@treyakridge not sure yet
@PassafireFamily yeah it gets confusing around the holidays for sure. My mom still calls me by my childhood name of Nicky
@Defiant311 that's always a great feeling
2 songs left to mix on the new album. Props to Chad and Scotch for kicking ass &amp; making all the deadlines to get the record out on 311 Day!
@Spacey311 yep!
@Andy311x yeah. Was a nickname. As in Hexy Perplexy
@TomDumontND thanks for the kind words. We have quite a history. I remember those days fondly! We helped each other for sure

@Spacey311 thanks!
Took the plunge and upgraded my Pro Tools to PT11.  Having to get all new AAX plug-ins but they are available for all the stuff I use.

My grandma was from Tennessee. She would either say hades or "H-E- double hockey sticks" when she wanted to cuss
“@Mammers311: @NickHexum sweet!! So excited!! Any rapping?” Yep
I put "hell" first but it seemed to braggy so I changed it to "hades" hehe #truestory
I'd tell you the title but Raspler would yell at me!  ;)
I just sang the hades out of this @311 song. My first vocal of the new album is done. It totally rocks.  Uptempo reggae that turns rocking

Ok, I'll stop now.  Much love.

@katluvs311 I like the name Jacks for your pup. I observed him dominating his brother so I think he will often rule the realm.
I pulled up at the meeting spot and saw a car with a huge 311 sticker. That must be them! :) @katluvs311 @step311
“@katluvs311: @NickHexum thank you for our new little man! He's fast asleep already and very loved @step311 http://t.co/hi03Xuwz” thank u2!
