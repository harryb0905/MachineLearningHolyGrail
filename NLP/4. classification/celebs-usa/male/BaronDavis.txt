Somebody get what I'm saying.   Small ball era should change the way the voting goes.  Guards and Forwards dominate the league. https://t.co/bCF3eb8l9X
No knock on Rudy I just think Gordon  has a bigger impact on the game for the Jazz.
When looking at players and impact they have on the game and team it's a different lense.  Stats support it but is not the deciding factor
@PointForwardPro not rolling??
Stats lie... impact don't
Rudy Gobert over Paul G and Gordon..they should pick the teams according to who is really nice and had a good year and not based on stats.
Why didn't I know about this ? @uclaanderson ... it's my fault.   I need to get back in school https://t.co/ut8s9N7Qaj

It would be a great game in all.  Really good match up... But u can't turn back the clock. I wish tho
16 Dubz are the truth tho.  And they won it last year.. They are even better this year!! Maybe summer charity game in the summer 😂😂😂
It would be a great game, this Dubs team is complete tho top to bottom.  Starting with Owners to last man ..Love my 07 squad to death tho.

What happen to the SB commercials where nobodies become somebody sheeeeesh... So long commercial actors...
Get the puppymonkeybaby in the game.
I have literally bite all my finger nails off. Out of boredom ... Hope this doesn't come down to the wire.   10 Nubs
No more commercials ... Attention all brands. Hire a new agency sheeeeesh 😷 ...
The energy at the super bowl reminds me of watching a 9ers game this year 😐
Turn on the beats pill on the bench.. Get Cam hype...
Where all the rappers that's been rocking with Carolina... Need y'all to freestyle to the team.

We need more projects in production that's the problem...  A lot of the black elite filmmakers ain't supporting the new wave of talent.
Need to give a chance to the next generation filmmakers of different races... Maybe hire me at a studio to green light some dope shit
Yes blacks need to have more opportunities in film I agree. We also have to do more to help each other.. Cant protest when it's convenient
Not rolling with boycotting the Oscars.  I'm going... If someone wants to invite me
