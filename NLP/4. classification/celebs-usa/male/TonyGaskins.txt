Interview with Tony Gaskins Jr. | "Make It Work" https://t.co/OUVE4xhBON via @YouTube
What He told you might not make sense to anyone but you. They can’t see your vision without your lenses.
Man has a plan and a way, but that may not be God’s way for you. Get connected with the plan for your life.
Trust Him in and out of season. It’s working in your favor when you least expect it.
@DrLeahGFrancis @GetUpErica @ImEricaCampbell @2TRILLION Thank you! I meant to say in this season of writing, I’m only reading the Holy Bible. Those 66 books contain more wisdom that we can digest in a lifetime so I’m still working on it. Bless you!
Thank you to all of you who have taken a course!! https://t.co/imj4tr8Esr

They are running a scam of the century @PalaceResorts on the membership side. Spent an hour on the phone and can’t speak to a supervisor. Just wanted to give you a heads up, if they market to you, please save your money!!!
Call @PalaceResorts all day and they have you on hold, can’t speak to a supervisor, can’t get anything booked.. after spending $30,000
I went to @PalaceResorts for some relaxation and it’s just been stress!
I’ve lost tens of thousands of dollars dealing with @PalaceResorts .. very nice resorts, but them memberships are a scam if I’ve ever seen one.
You might want to stay @PalaceResorts but DO NOT buy one of the memberships they offer. By far the worst vacation decision I’ve made in my life!! Horrible service. Lies at every turn. Stealing money. Selling information to scammers. It’s been wild.

@RadioGeisha @dominos @pizzahut Trust me on it. Pizza Hut changed their crust.. and with Dominos just make sure you request pan pizza.. it’s an extra charge, but it’s better now!

Hey @dominos pan pizza is actually better than @pizzahut now!! I don’t know why I realized that at 8:52am, but still, I had to share that.

Stand up for your sanity.. https://t.co/4PIJi9NwgA
Decisions have to be made and not everyone will understand. https://t.co/979tNhfio9
Don’t put all your trust in man. Know who holds all power. A way will be made regardless of who refuses to support you.
Trust His timing. You can’t rush it. You can’t force it. If it’s for you, it’ll come and be right on time.
First they ignore you, then they’ll need you. Circle of life!
When you have a Dream, there’s no difference between Monday and Friday.
Not Every Opinion Counts.. (from the eBook: CEO of Me) https://t.co/yderYfCEH8
Count your blessings, not your worries.
Self Love.. https://t.co/7B4MdmrzIT
@Regeanie Thank you very much! So great connecting with you!
Owe no man. The borrower becomes servant to the lender. Be careful what you accept. Snares are disguised as blessings and opportunities.
Separation before elevation.
Sometimes your cushion will be removed because there’s a greater lesson at rock bottom. Pay attention. The bounce-back will be televised.
Some people will only support you when it looks promising. The valley is necessary because that’s when you find out who’s really there for you. Embrace it and take notes. Everyone can’t go with you to the next level.
Check yourself. Pursue excellence in every area of life. Mediocrity isn’t acceptable.
This is a #SaturdaySermon . The Lord hit me with this as soon as I opened my eyes this morning and challenged my spirit. The truth will step on toes, but we have to evaluate ourselves… https://t.co/ku1mc1QrXg

You can’t control who likes you and who doesn’t. Be your best and those who don’t like it aren’t meant to be in your life.
Don’t stop dating your Wife. Keep doing what you did to make her fall in love.

Accept grace and live righteous going forward. If you take grace for granted, everything you’ve been granted will be taken.
Separation before elevation! https://t.co/np4m794k9Z
If you’re pursuing greatness, your presence will make some people uncomfortable because mediocrity is their norm. Be OK with not being in every circle.
You can’t expect people to understand your grind if God didn’t give them your vision.
Don’t try to be everything to others and lose your home. Take care of home first!
Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in faith, and in purity. -  1 Timothy 4:12
Dreams don’t help you sleep. Dreams wake you up!

Claim the day. Speak life. Keep your peace. Operate from love. Live life to the fullest.
Pick your battles wisely. What are you fighting? Why are you fighting? How are you fighting? Is it smart? Is it productive?
Abundance, joy, and success won’t come to those easily offended by others. Don’t give anyone control over your emotions.
I stop letting the thoughts and feelings someone else has about me affect the way I feel about myself. Love yourself and be your best!

Break the cycle and live to tell about it..
Sometimes we beg for relief when instead we should feel the pain and let it make us stronger. Don't run from it; run through it!
The adversary asked for permission to touch your life. The almighty allowed it because He knew it wouldn't kill you. Don't miss the lessons!
If you're going through and there's no escape, keep going. It's for your good. Don't miss the lessons.

Nothing teaches a person more than you doing for them what they wouldn't have done for you. Always operate from the right place.
Don't allow yourself to get upset with those who can't feel your pain. Soon you'll be given the opportunity to show them what support is.
When you're going through your trials in life it's hard to undertstsnd how the world continues to evolve around you.
Praying for those affected by these disasters happening around the world whether it's directly or indirectly. Painful to watch.
It'll get better! https://t.co/6MDTMTT6VP
Prayer is faith. Faith cannot be seen so the answers are often unrecognized. Prayer is why things aren't worse. God is God.
My prayers exceed my money. I pray without ceasing because I feel so much. People say prayer is useless but I know different.
Many don't feel pain anymore. We've become desensitized. If it's not knocking on their front door, many don't care.
These hurricanes. Wow. Keep praying because we won't have enough money to fix it all. A supernatural peace and understanding is needed.
You're being setup! https://t.co/mLLZbrsbxy
Keep pressing! Embrace every trial. Get the lesson. Appreciate the scars. It's working in your favor!
There's always a lesson before the blessing!
Don't put limits on yourself!
There will always be pain, chaos, and injustice all around you. What's most important is how you respond to it. Don't let it stop you!
Don't try to box me in until I'm going in the ground.

If you're reading this, you're blessed.
Not everyone can bear the pain of the promise. Your journey could destroy someone who isn't built for it.
Don't beg a human to believe in you. Trust God. If they turn their back on you before your breakthrough they weren't meant to go with you.
Don't overlook your blessings. They're all around you. Appreciate what you have instead of coveting what you don't.
Where are you operating from? Never operate from a place of fear, hate, anger or jealousy. Don't give the world control over your day.

You might not look like what you're going through. They can't see your pain. That's grace and mercy! Keep pressing and believing!

If you're breathing you're blessed. Count blessings not problems.
You'll be given a choice; breakdown or breakthrough. Choose wisely.
@GregWhite32 Thank you brother!!
While you're in the valley, learn. While you're in the climb, learn. When you're on top, learn. Another challenge is coming so be ready.
We don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds it. Your breakthrough could be when you least expect it.
Don't quit right before the breakthrough.
Priorities matter. Know what really matters and put those things first.

Know what matters and what doesn't. Not everything is worth your energy and attention.
You can have money and still be poor if you don't have a purpose bigger than making money. Whose life are you making better?
Don't chase money! Chase purpose and let the money chase you.
Don't lose yourself. Know who you are and be that.
You can force it, or you can attract it. Become who you need to be and what's for you will come to you.
Pray that it comes, but not a second before you're ready to receive it.
There is no competition if you're being yourself. Don't look left or right, look ahead.
Lessons then blessings. If you miss the lesson you'll miss your blessing!
We need more self love!
When you know it's time to let it go, listen!

First I wanted love. Then I wanted money. Then I got them both and I realized what matters most; LOVE!
Love yourself, then love someone else, then allow them to love you back. Love conquers all.
When a man loves the right woman whole heartedly, everything in his life changes for the better.
I learned that love shouldn't be a painful struggle. If it doesn't make you a better person, it's not love.
When the clock strikes midnight the Queen and I will begin celebrating 10 years of a happy marriage. God is good!

You can't please man. You'll never be good enough for a human because he's not good enough for himself. Ironically, pleasing God is easier.
Make moves with confidence and in silence. Appreciate the grind. You can build stumbling blocks or stepping stones, it's how you look at it.
Work from the inside-out. Do what makes sense to you. Follow purpose, not just dreams. Trust God and His process. Success is inevitable.
I've never had a mentor. Never had a full time staff or team. God, my Wife, and myself. But He is able.
I thank God He showed me a way.

Some people want you to be quiet about your blessings to accommodate their limited mindset. Let them know God is able.
Don't deny God His praise just because someone might get offended.

They see the shine, not the grind. They see the smile, not the struggle. They envy the success, but don't respect the process.
Some of the very people who have needed you or asked you to support them will turn their back when it's time to support you. Take notes.
When you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, the next persons success doesn't discourage you. You know yours is coming.
Some people can't stand to see others shine.. don't be one of them people.
A way will be made out of no way. In the last hour your breakthrough can still happen. Keep the faith!
Keep pressing! Don't depend on the help of others. Do what you can. If they help, great. If they don't, keep going!

The adversary asked for permission to touch your life. He can touch you but he can't destroy you. Pray thru it. Tough times don't last.
When man is silent during your time of need it's because God wants you to hear Him. Get the lessons then the blessings.
Don't worry yourself to death. Start counting blessings and know that it will work out just fine. You've made it through worse.

Every move must be the best move at that time. If it doesn't align with the end goal, don't make it.
It's harder to please humans than it is to please God. The irony of life.
Don't count your problems. Count your blessings. You're abundantly blessed!
Don't force a situation that should be let go. Know when it's over and be willing to move forward smarter and stronger.
God is still on the throne! You're taken care of in this very moment so know that you'll be ok tomorrow too!
You won't miss a beat. You'll go from favor to more favor. You weren't born to live a mediocre life.

Whatever you're going through, get a lesson from it!
Sometimes you have to experience what you thought you wanted, just to realize that's not what you need.
If they walk out of your life, it's for the best. Sometimes you have to let people go so you can grow.
One day at a time. Get every lesson. Don't rush the process. When you make it, you'll appreciate the journey more!

Some things you see as blessings are really snares. The enemy knows how to make a snare look like a blessing.

@michaelaadele blessings!
@michaelaadele the question we're all asking. Hopefully we figure it out.
@msonemic that's a scary thought but it's beginning to look that way.
@michaelaadele my money isn't money to this system. I'm not Oprah. You probably have more money than me.
@ShontiarMrs it definitely can't be justified.
@PURE_HEAVN I feel you!
It's almost like some cops are saying: Hey, they aren't giving out prison time so let me kill one too. It's painful out here.
A lack of understanding leads to fear and fear leads to hate. Hate then leads to murders. Then the cycle continues.
We need more understanding and there will be less fear. I understand #AltonSterling but the cops who killed him... Was it hate or fear?
We've protested, they killed another. We've rioted, they killed another. What's next? Is it a physical war? Is it a psychological war?
I battle with allowing myself to process the emotions. It's hard to see these murders happen and not be filled with anger.
If you let doubt set in, your mind will create your reality. Never lose hope that things will get better.
Don't be a rebound... https://t.co/DUbljG0Eza
You don't know how God will move, but just know that He will. Faith over everything!

No matter what the future holds, know who holds it. He won't put more on you than you can bear.
Faith and Work. That's the recipe. Keep believing. Keep working. You won't be denied!

I was insecure a couple days ago, but you told me that pain births purpose. Now I do what I want with confidence. ~My 9-yr old, TG III
Thankful to the @TheNBPA for inviting me to speak at the @Top100Camp
#PrayForTheWorld Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it. ~Helen Keller
God will open doors that were closed. He will baffle your spectators. Stay humble.
First you want money. Then you want love. Then you get them both and you realize which matters most.
We swam all day.. Then I had to teach Real Love University from 9-10pm.. I finish and come out… https://t.co/y7s8x77NWf
God does more than you expect. Your biggest blessings can't be forced. Just be prepared to receive.
You may not realize it now but your path is being made clear. Keep walking by faith.
@IAmSteveHarvey thank you! It was an honor!
Thankful to @IAmSteveHarvey for the work he is doing for our young men! It's beyond words!
#PrayForOrlando Horrible news.
God is good everyday. He's making a way and no one can block it. Stay focused and keep pressing!
As you learn you should teach. As you grow, help others grow as well.

Birth Your Book session tomorrow in ATL! -&gt; https://t.co/K5KXISj7U3
Step out on faith even if you have to walk alone. Not everyone can go where you're going and not everyone deserves to. Claim your blessings.
It will make sense when it's supposed to. Just because you don't understand it now doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense.
In due time everything falls into place. Keep the faith and keep working toward your goals. What's yours is yours and no one can stop that.
Have the thought. Speak the words. Do the work.
They want to call it "fluff" and "ra ra," but truthfully there is power in your words. Speak life. Speak success.
Marriage is easy. Business is easy. Because I chose to see it that way, it became just that, easy. Change your outlook.
It's what you say it is. Be careful how you label anything in your life. For me, life is easy and there is no failure. Bcuz I said so!
Have a vision and believe in it. You may be the only one who can see it, but that's enough. They'll catch on later.
You teach people how to treat you by what you allow, what you stop, and what you reinforce.
Those who doubted you will have to eat their words. Be consistent. Your time is coming!
Do what's best for you... (https://t.co/m7jKTn9F6Z) https://t.co/jDDzRRwrCb
Check your heart! https://t.co/OTaStgCZQ6
God is so good! If you don't know Him, His will, and His way, I urge you to get to know Him. His way changed my life.
Everyday you write a page of your story. Make sure it's worth reading.
I'm not focused on money or fame. I'm focused on legacy. Leave something to inspire people even after you're gone.
#MuhammadAli inspired me. I studied his strength and perseverance. Not many men are built like that today. #Greatness

Birth Your Book! Live session in ATL June 11th-&gt; https://t.co/K5KXISj7U3 https://t.co/WrDvOvtEC1
The best things in life take time. If you rush it, you'll ruin it.
When you start to go from good to Great, there's a process of elimination that must happen. Not everyone will make it.
You can't reach your peak carrying dead weight. Some people will have to be let go.
You have the greatest life and the most opportunities. Once you realize that, doors begin to open.
Count your blessings not your worries.
Everything is preparation for your moment. Enjoy the climb. When it's your time no one will be able to stop it.
A person playing a role will eventually forget their act. Be patient and watch closely.
Aspiring Authors! Meet me in Atlanta on June 11th! -&gt; https://t.co/K5KXISj7U3 https://t.co/lOIVhb9HeT
Patience is key. Don't settle for less right before your breakthrough. Be patient, you'll know what's for you when you see it.
If money is your only motivation, you'll always be lacking.
Do what's best for you! If you don't look out for yourself, who will?

If you're being obedient to His will then don't question the process. The plan has already been set in place.
Give your all. Better your best. The results will take care of themselves.
They may not realize your worth until it's too late; but as long as you know your worth you'll reach your rightful place!
It's coming! Be consistent. Be patient. But be ready!
Don't worry about the doubters. As long as you know your worth and where you're going in life, that's all that matters.
@StrongDLo @iAm_StatXII @AudenT_18 great meeting y'all fellas!
Do you have a book in you that you need to get out? Join me next month in ATL-&gt; https://t.co/SAaAvp86bu https://t.co/PNQmpcFIRp
I quit worrying. If it's meant to be, God has already worked it out. If it's not meant to be, there's better coming.
You teach people how to treat you by what you allow, what you stop, and what you reinforce.
Handle one day at a time. His grace is sufficient and it renews daily.
You can fulfill your dreams if you work towards it. Anything is possible if you believe it.
Real love. https://t.co/D2aGzlKKlP
@JurrellSmith thank you for being a part of it! Bless you on the journey!!

Don't let your insecurities confuse someone else's confidence for arrogance. Be confident!
@Joceeboo bless you sis!! Thank you!!
Separation before elevation. Not everyone can go where you're going.
Don't let anyone drive you crazy. Not family, not friends, not a spouse. Stand up for your sanity.
Be grateful for the life you have. It could always be worse. But things will only get better from here.
The pure hearted will always be taken care of. Stay the course.
God's positioning will baffle the minds of your spectators. Get aligned for your blessings!
In a world of takers, be a giver. In the end, we win.
Don't ever count yourself out! Most good things happen when you least expect them. Keep the faith, it will work out.

You have more than enough! Once you realize that, your potential is unlocked.
Push through! Someone is counting on you more than you're counting on yourself.
Some will doubt you. Some will count you out. But they don't have any say over your destiny. Your blessings are on the way!
It will work out in your favor. Everything comes full circle. You won't miss a blessing!
Those hoping you fail will have to watch you succeed. Give them a show.
If you're going to be in it, be positive about it. It could always be worse so be grateful.
There is no competition. You are your only competition. Better your best and you won't have to worry about the rest.
Make a plan. Then make a move. Don't talk about it, be about it!
Treat Your Relationship Like A House...  https://t.co/hA0SmFVPoS via @tonygaskins
Keep doing what you did to win their love if you want to keep their love. Love doesn't just fade; we stop working.
The truth won't change just because you got offended.
It may not happen when you want it to, but it'll happen when you're truly ready. Be patient for your blessings!
God's favor can't be explained.
It's hard to find honest people who work with integrity. Be a person of integrity and you will attract people like you!
Don't focus on their blessings. Open up and prepare for yours. They'll come if you're ready to receive them.
Some people won't like you because they don't like themselves. You can't take everything personal.
You can learn from anything, anywhere. There are lessons all around you. Pay attention.
@PhillipSmall thanks Coach!
Know that it will work out for your good no matter what it looks like right now.

Your gifts will make room for you. Operate in your gifts to the best of your ability and the results will follow.

@ellenpstebbins that's awesome!! Thank you for watching!
@YogiRoth thanks brother! Same to you!!
Be YOU. There's room for you if you're authentic to who you truly are.
Don't put limits on yourself. You can outgrow things that you once thought was bigger than you.
Peace, happiness, and prosperity is a journey. You'll never get there unless God is ordering your steps.
Trust God's plan for your life! You don't have to force it. It will happen in perfect timing.

Get in where you fit in for now. The last will be first. So don't worry about where you start, it's about where you finish.
Don't wait until it's too late before you realize who is really there to help you. Don't push away good people out of fear.
Keep a pure heart. Although many may not recognize right away, eventually it'll be undeniable.

Be patient! You haven't been forgotten. Everything you deserve is on the way. Your job is simply to prepare. Get ready!
Don't ever be someone's rebound. Give them time to heal their heart. If not, your heart will become a casualty in love and war.
Your breakthrough usually happens when your faith takes you beyond the point of giving up. Keep pressing forward!
Praying for our world! So much pain and hate, but I'm convinced that the good will win in the end.
If you've ever wondered who I do it for, it's Him. Growing up I told friends, I don't want to be… https://t.co/SGOVCABLbQ
Evil will always try to erase the good, but if you have a good heart don't change. In the end, we win!
You can't win in life if you're losing in your mind. Think VICTORY over defeat at all times.
Don't be desperate, be ready. If it's for you, it will find you.
If you're chasing the limelight, please know that it will shine on your flaws too.
You can't fail at being yourself.
They'll doubt you. They'll wonder how you did it. They'll ask why you. But stay consistent and every doubter will become a believer.
@CoachGower thanks a lot Coach! Much appreciated!
Speak life into your situation. Don't talk yourself out of your peace and happiness. Stay positive!
Be patient for your moment. It'll come when you need it the most.
What's for you is for you. Run your race and you'll get what's rightfully yours.
You'll know the real from the fake soon enough. Pay attention.
If your goals are behind you, you have a problem. Always strive to be better!
It will come when you least expect it. Know that you haven't been forgotten. You will be taken care of. Keep pressing!
If it's not worth breaking up over.. https://t.co/1reP4nyDCL
Just do the work and operate in your gifts. The blessings will come.
You will always be taken care of if you're doing it for the right reasons.
Your blessings may come after the moment you feel like there is no hope. Knowing that, never lose faith!
If you believe in yourself long enough, eventually everyone else will too. Keep working!
One day at a time. If you rush it, you'll ruin it. Let the natural occur.
There isn't always a quick fix. Sometimes you have to stay the course.
Trust the process of greatness. Great things take time to build.
My interview with Motivate U -&gt; https://t.co/CnCpGMFEWM
Let the results make the noise. Work in silence.
It's about your time. Stay faithful. Stay focused. You've come this far so keep going. The breakthrough is around the corner!
God will put you in positions that will baffle the minds of men. Own your space. You're destined for Greatness.
Set standards for your life and don't compromise. If you don't know your value, you'll never get what you're worth.
You are the CEO of your life! https://t.co/SCYxshrbYV
Evaluate the people in your life! Then promote, demote, or terminate. You are the CEO of your life!
@luzamukunda lol!
If people did half of what their Bio says they do, the world would be a better place.
When you pray, start preparing. If it's in His will, it will come and you have to be sure that you're ready to receive!
You can't cheat the grind. It knows how hard you've worked and you will only get out what you've put in.
Think beyond your current situation. Don't settle for what you have. Dream bigger!

Trust God when you can't see a way! Have an unshakable faith and it will work in your favor.
You won't meet many honest people who operate with integrity. Be that person!

Do your best to see the full vision before you start the mission. Don't do anything that doesn't align with the goals.
Others will respect you as much as you respect yourself. Even when they don't look out for you, you have to look out for you.
If you do you, there is no competition. God bless em, but they can't be you. Just focus on your work.

Let God work https://t.co/V1hWb1pNvn
There is room for everyone. You just have to be willing to put in the work to claim your spot.
You can't please everyone. Some people can't see your heart because of their hurt.
God will use the least-likely if you're willing to do the work.
If you don't believe it about yourself, it's not true. If you think you're a failure, that's what you will be. Speak life.
Success and failure start in the mind. Win the battle in your mind and you can win in life.

"I WON'T COMPLAIN"  REV.PAUL JONES  (Extended Version)  Praise Break https://t.co/bKtSyyI8qX
You can make excuses or you can make things happen!
Desire more so you can give more, not so you can have more, and you'll get more!
What you put into the world will come back to you. There's so much lack because we operate from a mindset of scarcity.
Bless somebody! Even if you have to give from your lack, give of yourself!
Don't sell your self-respect.
Staying with someone for financial security isn't a good enough reason. Money can't buy peace of mind.

Growth is a painful process but the rewards are priceless. If you want real success, it'll require real growth!
You can't have God's riches (peace, happiness, prosperity) without His righteousness.
There is belief and then there is doubt. The choice you make will determine if you become great or average.
You could make a change in the world but it starts with you.

When I'm done &amp; I go see the Father I want to be exhausted from my service to the world. I want to leave it all here.
A lot of people today want to be "famous" so they can stunt on haters. Having a positive impact on others isn't their goal.
You can't use people in the climb and then expect to have longevity at the top. You'll get what you give.
If you don't have patience, humility, and a heart of service, you aren't ready to be significant.
If you want to "make it" so you can be looked up to and look down on others, you won't last long.
True Greatness is rooted in genuine humility towards others and gratitude towards God for the gifts bestowed upon us.
. @MissyElliott has so much talent and she's done it all but she's humble as if she's done nothing.
I love @MissyElliott spirit! So humble and she doesn't have to be. She's taken out so much time to speak to young artist that I mentor.

We need God. We need more active parents. We need prayer in schools.

We do what we have to do. So make your dreams mandatory not optional, and you'll succeed.
