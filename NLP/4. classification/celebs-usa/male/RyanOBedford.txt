@C_da_Gent Show me a local black community that has elected a conservative...and I’ll show you progress. They’ve been scammed by the Dems for decades. We need new young black conservative leaders! Forget the national level politics, this is local.
@MDunston3 There hasn’t been any republicans running those communities. Dems have failed the local black communities. The black communities are waking up and realizing they need better representation.
Amen! Voting Dem for 60 years and nothing changes in their communities...You have a plan to get the black community out of that rut...when do you turn 35? Owens 2024? 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/BC2biBfVQ5

@beaudoin_patty @BenjaminSWatson @SenSanders She should have the right to terminate the pregnancy, but not terminate a life. Heartbeat = life. This eliminates the rape/assault cases because it’s weeks later. It’s common sense common ground policy on the issue.
@beaudoin_patty @BenjaminSWatson @SenSanders Murder is terminating a heartbeat. That gives rape/assault victims weeks to “choose”. It’s not a man vs woman issue, it’s a life issue.
@BenjaminSWatson @SenSanders Murder?!?

@inggvR The abundance of weapons have been around forever. To solve a problem, you have to understand the variables. That isn’t a variable, it’s been a constant. I’m asking why this isn’t being looked into.
@inggvR There’s a rampant abuse of violent games in the US. I’m not saying they aren’t sold in other countries, but kids in the US are sitting behind their TVs 8-14 hours a day. It’s numbing their minds to the murder.
@inggvR 👍🤛🏻
The difference between the 60s-mid 90s and mid 90s-now.... before: no armed officers in schools, guns were just as accessible, no security measures at schools...now: we have the opposite with VIDEO GAMES and cyber bullying.
I keep saying this...the single greatest commonality between all of these school shooting is VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES. It’s like a drug to these kids! It perverts their minds into an alter personality. @FoxNews #SantaFeHighSchool https://t.co/aUkQv5lWCh

@matth660 Regardless, we both know it’s politically motivated and with the polarization of politics in today’s age, some people literally assume it’s that easy to buy or rent an AR-15. They are using fear to contrude the facts. It is not art.
And this will be the cause of the next recession...if people can’t stop spending on lattes and amazon prime, how do we expect the Federal govt to stop spending? Personal and federal debt is at an all time high. It’s not about being rich, it’s about being smart. https://t.co/9rwL7WvkEK

@matth660 Well they’re literally suggesting getting an AR is as easy as renting a Bubler in MKE, and it’s simply not true...give it a try...And I’m only expressing how stupid of a comparable this is.
2 problems here. 1. You can’t rent an AR-15, so bad representation. Can’t even own in Chicago. 2. Actually giving those to the good guys in Chi town might do some good. Can’t get much worse than it is now. https://t.co/usflzsfF50

@Mo_Farah It's not a Muslim ban, read it. Look at Europe, America is next if we don't do something. https://t.co/60ofGCwnfJ
@Mo_Farah Gotta love Twitter!
@Mo_Farah no surprise, @realDonaldTrump said he'd execute temp ban if he won. People spoke. He's keeping promise. Proper vetting is a must.
@Sammar_23 @helloiamjunaid @scotsdave67 as soon as thousands of them come across our border and kill us. That's a different prob, don't mix
@helloiamjunaid @Mo_Farah Again, it's not a ban on just refugees. It's on all visas. Stop making it out like we are evil people.
@dextweets1 @Mo_Farah like I said...Ban them all. We should be figuring out a solution before opening the flood gates like BO.
@theonlywayisup @hudshaker @corinpearce @Mo_Farah hahaha I am my only sponsor now. I don't please anyone anymore. RT RT RT
@helloiamjunaid @scotsdave67 he should. But at least this is more than BO did to protect us. It's only a start.
@helloiamjunaid @scotsdave67 you're missing the point...temp ban until they figure out a valid vetting procedure. Quit jumping to conclusion
@scotsdave67 @helloiamjunaid @Mo_Farah ban em all. I don't care and don't take offense to it. Btw it's a temp ban until they figure it out
@hudshaker @corinpearce @Mo_Farah well if he's dumb enough to show his Somalia passport then they should think twice.
@helloiamjunaid @Mo_Farah the ban isn't just on "refugees". So don't make it sound like it's just women and children that are banned.
@corinpearce @Mo_Farah this ban doesn't affect him. He's British. Stop instigating something that isn't a problem.
Mad respect to @Mo_Farah, but today's world is different now. It's not about hate, it's about keeping Americans safe from terrorism.
@shroyer6 @realDonaldTrump I'm saying those fools out in the streets are being a bunch of whiny children. You have the wrong person.
@shroyer6 @realDonaldTrump I managed to make it 8 years without rioting, protesting, or burning flags because I disagreed w/ BO. Whiners?
In 8 days, @realDonaldTrump has done more than @BarackObama did in 8 years. Difference between a talker and a doer.

@chadhedrick because injuries are more prevalent. NFL gets bonuses, NBA doesnt. Less staff, more games, it makes sense, not saying it's fair
@chadhedrick $8.5B in revenue for NFL versus $5.1B for NBA. 32 teams in NFL, 30 in NBA. That's $5.1M per player in NFL and $11.3M in NBA
@chadhedrick No doubt! NBA bench players are getting paid more than the NFLs best players. Problem is 15 man roster vs 53 man roster

@AaronRodgers12 is finally playing like @AaronRodgers12!!! Discount Double Check! GOPACKGO
@J2K111 haha, those replacement refs were USS officials. Yellow cards, yellow flags, what's the difference?
@kipcarpenter about time. Call me sometime, when you aren't too busy.
As far as I'm concerned, teacher unions can go, but my kid can't grow up in a world with piss poor nfl refs. He won't learn right from wrong
#GOPACKGO going down boys!! @jrcelski @ApoloOhno
