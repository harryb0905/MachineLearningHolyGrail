NYTimes "TRUTH" ad on Oscar show tonight height of arrogance...Self proclaimed arbiter of truth.?
@Reince  did a great job representing @POTUS on @MeetThePress despite usual @chucktodd attack mode.
Democrats/Media have selective amnesia about Pres. Obama telling #2 Russian that after election he'd "have more flexibility "...
Watching @Morning_Joe and listening to their criticism of Pres Trump and judiciary...They seem to forget Pres Obama attack on SCOTUS.
Beside playing the best #SuperBowl ever, Tom Brady said something after the game that everyone should take to heart. https://t.co/yMUTP83eSV

No raise… No promotion… Summer vacation might be just the time to take stock of where you stand in your company. https://t.co/ivgsI2GBB5
Mrs Clinton on Fox Sunday said FBI Head Comey agreed that she had told truth.....How with a straight face can she say that??????
.@krauthammer said tonight.If Mrs Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails were all about yoga appointments and wedding plans?? No security issue😀
Med reports 61 Dem speeches last night and no mention of ISIS or ISIL.Meanwhile French priest beheaded.Happy talk not cure. Crazy!
Clinton campaign ignores CONTENT of DNC emails and goes immediately to RUSSIANS/TRUMP as COVERUP and MSM joins chorus.
Great wife ..too! https://t.co/ErvGMjDFvn
Any lingering doubt about MSM"in tank"for HRC erased by sycophantic interview questions raised in 60 Minutes interview tonight

Kim Strassel in Friday WSJ op-Ed outs the real Jim Comey..not a pretty picture.Just another political hack. Just more clever.
Sure hope R's behave in hearings today and recognize gift Comey has delivered to them.
Going all-in always wins -- don't sprinkle!  https://t.co/7a5V8dOfDT
R's PLEASE leave Comey alone on indictment. PLEASE focus on his  description of Clinton character. Not qualified to be POTUS
R's fortunate to have Comey cave in...She is most beatable D candidate.  Biden as replacement would have been tough to beat.
D's believe voters are stupid. Last week AG and former Pres meet.This aft. Pres and Mrs Clinton traveling.Comey cleanup before
No Racism and hate here...D's go there when nothing else to say..#SCOTUS https://t.co/dTDi5Il4UB

This debate confirms Reince Priebus is a complete disaster .How many elections must R's lose before this Man is removed.
Why would R's ever let wildly liberal Raddatz be part of R debate.Don't they watch Sun. if ABC insists on her...dump them
She got more votes than others on stage in Iowa ...only place where votes have been cast https://t.co/AhKffDqcno
Republicans must insist that ABC include Carly Fiorina     participate in Saturday night debate
Watching Democratic debate....Where do these 4 people on stage think jobs come from

Back to excruciatingly slow baseball night after crazy, wonderful BB and Hockey playoffs ...Go Red Sox!!
What a great series.....Hockey back!!!!
Bruins went into Defensive stance and forgot offense...they paid
C'mon Bruins.  5 more good minutes..  Stupid penalty at mid ice
What a great first period for Bruins...should have been up 2-3 more goals..Dangerous when one period goes all one way. Next?

Ginobili as bad tonight as good last game...but what a time to flame out...James just too good..2min left.
Duncan must play not rest...later!!!!!!!
Well so far Parker Ginobili having awful 3rd Q...not what Spurs need
Great Spurs run at half need big 2nd half from Ginobili and Parker ...you can be sure James will have   World class finish
Spurs better get Duncan back in game..he can rest next 6 months..Done w/o him
One of the best things about being back in Nantucket...get to watch @JohnDennisWEEI and @GerryCallahan rant about Doc Rivers.
Bruins looking so  good and  power play last chance for Hawks

Media bias???  Just imagine if George Bush traveled to Las Vegas the night of the Middle East tragedy.
RT @CEvans94 @jack_welch President should have addressed nation in Prime Time last night at the White House. Not at a Vegas fundraiser.
American Leadership today in Middle East is reminiscent of Carter in 1979...
Unbelievable seeing media caught ganging up on Romney when issue was Middle East policy and tragic death of Amb

Glad I'm no SanFran kick returner..Both defenses great..Harbaugh brothers had tough losses
Had to feel bad for Ravens and kicker..tough loss
Nice Brady move with ball
@Tedinho10 only one
Good pats stop
@gregeliteutah play action passes
Pats better do something when they get ball down 1!!!!!.. Defense back to pre playoff antics and offense too cautious
Love Patriots. Puzzled by their cautious calls. End of half and 3rd down on latest drive
Great Patriots drive. Hope Patriot defense doesn't revert to pre playoff form..fast Raven score not good omen
Jon Huntsman is a good guy but a terrible national political candidate..Utah is where he shines
@adj2411 agree with you on Celtics. Decline so rapid tough to figure out. Age?????or something else?
Harry Reid on MTP will say anything..unbelievable!!!  Ignores his own pro tem trick on Pres Bush.
The critics were right..Newt really will say and do anything to try to win ..such a sad flaw in an otherwise smart guy
@MayraMejiaBAMS Can't wait
@dlandry9 37/38 and 15 points Pretty big to me
@iceolation01 that is fair
@johnston_kelly nice 10 percent 4th or 5th!!!!

@McBlondeLand @beckyquickcnbc @SquawkCNBC Looked at Huntsman and found his leadership STYLE wanting
@Lazystocktrader @beckyquickcnbc Reagan was an actor and former GOV. as candidate.. Romney far more impressive at this stage
Tebow sure pulled the trigger...and John 3:16  ( and yards)!!!!! Sure a lot different than last week!!!
First playoff game a DUD..Hope 2nd better..Rep debate will require massive switching
Looking forward to energizing discussion on@squawkcnbc on Monday from 7-9 covering  global economy and politics

@markg0077 I like Trump..just not good for any candidates gravitas
@MarkHawkins7 that is a real issue

Republican candidates must avoid Trump moderated debate or be relegated to "reality show" status
@MJScanlon50 agree with you
Andrew Luck deserves Heisman both for his football and his exemplary character

Red Sox have to give contract to Big Papi sooner rather than later".he has earned at least 1 year
Nothing in baseball like Yankees/Red Sox Games. Sox left 16 on base last night ..Hope this aberration is over.
@ToddDayton Babson great school, particularly for entrepreneurship

Mitt Romney comes alive in Iowa rally taking on hecklers with strong arguments..Corporations are people and job creators.
@sheldonbk not at all. See my tweet. Trashing is a losing tactic but a human emotion
RT @FloridaJayhawk How about @CNBC trashing the rating agencies? @jack_welch @beckyquickcnbc Trashing rating agency is a loser.
Morning Joe doing great job highlighting just who is fighting war. This weekends tragic loss of life has to heat up war debate
Having dealt with Rating Agencies for years I'm certain that Administration trashing them for downgrade is a losing tactic
Rachel Maddow silly partisanship hurts real discussion on MTP. Equal to having Sean Hannity on Fox News Sunday
Silliness over. Real issue growth and cuts,,,missing first half of 2011 GDP more than offsets savings. fMedia asleep
Congrats to folks starting "Becoming a Leader" program today. Tons of great learning in 6 wks. Good luck! http://t.co/Y2l933G
Joe moved back to his roots this morning and made Morning Joe a great show for me this morning
@unclejunkmuses I just like Prince I am huge Patriots fan
Hope NY Giants and my friend Prince Amukamara come to contract agreement quickly..they need each other
Great Red Sox win today in Chicago..Pedroia awesome
@psorensen Was higher during WW2 and came down in 50's 60's as we had No foreign competition..2011 higher than any point in 60's
@psorensen No I was not as level to GDP was at levels we could handle..70% going to 100 is not!!
It's all about actual level of debt and the debate has to turn to LEVEL as we go through next 16 months of election chatter
pleased parties appear to have Debt ceiling under control..BUT!!! actual debt remains and needs real leadership plan
@Mayor_Matt agree. Brokaw always great
Meet the Press enhanced today by Idaho candor Congressman's challenges..So much more effective for show than President PR flack
Very impressive and candid Idaho Congressman on Meet The Press this am..challenged panelists
@JeremyHL I agree. Just doesn't feel right buying wins with these July trades
Lester great tonight. Big relief with current staff. Like the Hardin trade tonight. Cleveland wins lottery with Jiminez
Why does any form of "Balanced Budget" make Democrats crazy?.Every family works to get in this position every day
House passes Bill.. Now real negotiations start,,

Looks like Gang of 6/7 has a reasonable plan as long as they are sure they will really get cost out.BTW nice Red Sox win today
Hope Sox bring in Bard if they get ahead. Papelbon Charade as closer should end soon
Tonight's RedSox Rays game more important than usual..Beckett must be great! Can't afford another pitcher on DL
Tough loss for USA Woman's soccer. Last minute goals a killer
RT @Intexch @jack_welch great article on FoxNews on the 7 myths about the looming Debt Ceiling 'Disaster' : http://t.co/JtWrCoJ
Obama is a real spinmeister.Look at his latest budget this spring to get his true feelings on deficits and big Government
Red Sox could be in serious trouble if starting pitchers remain on DL. Becketts last two starts have been his weakest.
Red Sox escape disaster. If Lester out and Papelbon blew save would be worst night of year. 3-2 win soothes pain

@Travelanswerman Thanks for your generous words
Another break in the Global Warming  message.The NYT report on these e-mails just demands that we have a true national debate BEFORE acting.
Now we really going off the rails with bi-partisan efforts to get House of Rep into Monetary Policy. Look at their record on Fiscal side.

My wifes love of Red Sox and desire to see Yankees lose has given me a partner who rarely watches sports
Watching Pedro in Yankee Stadium is surreal. I want him to win almost as much as when he was a Red Sox.
The House health proposal is a fiction filled with cost savings that will never be realized.
@juliacarroll11 Thanks for nice words. Ron Paul has some good ideas but his anti Globalization stance turns me off
@ savitsky Amen!
How are Companies with pay limits going to hire new stars against those without. The uncertainty of "what's next" is a killer
White House fight with Fox on surface sure looks like a Big Loser. Will be interesting to watch play out.
Part2 Thanks to so many of you for helping me win my toughest battle yet. Your tweets, letters gave me strengh and reminded me howlucky I am
I am walkiing out of Col Pres Hosp in NY tom 92 days after arriv The drs and staff here were rermarkable, capable and kind. Real caregivers
I was surprised that my Yankee whining post didn't bring out  Red Sox attacks. Yankee fans must not be worried about Red Sox this year
Yankees get big break as Minn and Detroit have to shoot their best in playoff with winner playing rested Yankees
@BurtWilliamson Burt I always believed the leader should take the last swing for the order.Leader gets audienceand more often than not order
Chicago Olympic loss a big one. Pres Obama should not be criticized for going for it. Chicago is his city and he did the right thing!!!
BofA CEO Ken Lewis ouster is tragic. He was a strong bamk executive who didn't navigate Gvt relations well.
Sec. Gates sure looks uncomfortable discussing Afghan strategy. Left has WH  In corner over Afghan direction. Tough call
Gordon Brown looks like a failing businessperson on way out a-- "dead man walking". It is sad to watch self confidence ooze out of anyone
Red Sox loss is one thing. Losing Lester would be devastating. BTW middle relief has been huge weakness not strength predicted
The Iran nuclear processing facility, the crazy speeches, the old corruption-filled org(food for oil) just remind you---- UN useless!!!!
I've received many stories of successful staph infection battles from my Twitter friends Please keep them coming. I love reading them
Hi friends. I apolog for dropping out with  10 week trip to Col Pres Hosp in NY. My staph infect clearing and release in sight (3-4wks)
He had a huge impact on life in US. I didn't agree with him often but in every encounter over20 years he always kept his word. I liked him
Kennedy celebration of life was impressive
How about Ortiz. I never thought he would get his Home Run swing back this season. Congrats to mgt for hanging with him
What else can Pres Obama throw in the mix. Now the course reversal on the CIA and a 2 Trillion $ miss on LTdefict projection
Cision@Jasvjr Bernanke is his best decision.  I agree
Congratulations to Pres Obama on appointing Chairman Bernanke to Fed Res Chair
How will we be able to staff CIA with stars if we keep prosecuting them with Hindsight?  Politics are not pretty or inspiring
Beckett has had a brutal scary week----8 home runs!!!
Been following debate on shape of US recovery. My view: recovery will look better than it is and chances for another leg down are 50-50
Still in shock Tazawa beating Burnett. That may not mean much for Division but is something teams will think about in shorter playoff series
Sorry if I appeared too hard on Bowden. I was surprised by his delivery after all the hype I had heard
Hope Red Sox pitching tonight is not preview of Sept when Lester Beckett don't start. Bowden huge disappointment tonight

Had good day in hospital. Helped I'm sure by 3rd straight Red Sox win in Balt and 3rd str Yankee loss in Chicago.
Worst part of (still) being stuck in hospital is realization that only 2 news stories on TV involve a bizarre beer summit + MJ's last hours

Discussions on Sotomayer on morning talk shows repetitive and boring. She is qualified and will be seated! Lot of hot air will be expended
Mitt Romney on Fox News Sunday was at his best. Balanced and thoughtful on future of R party. Nice idea on spinning off Gvt. shares in GM.

Thanks to Twitter friends who helped us write this weeks BW col. on signs of "political green shoots" Cheney ideas and Calif. tax revolt
@deljonesNice story..we are writing one for BW this week on "why we Tweet"
@AIDSGUY "most"
@bjflanagan "most"
Supreme Court nominee being challenged sensibly so far..personal attacks minimum..Maybe    sanity returning to debate..Ideas not personality
Enjoyed Scarborough book party..Book is terrific..a thoughtful Republican's  inclusive "big tent" principals to get voice back
@stevebeste Steve..Thanks...lets let it go and start over..Be well
@BurghmanPitts She was there and everyone loves her   good inside and out
@stevebeste because you are a mean guy sometimes
@evshear  Scarborough...tough to pick one
Off to Morning Joe's new book party at Michaels...should be fun and a very big book
@TommyMills I agree..and thinkYouklis 3rd and Bay 4th is best lineup
Magic Cavs series one of best ever tough someone has to lose
@BurghmanPitts Obama won the election
@ENLIGN This is working pretty well..i do it myself and I want to do it right..i'll consider it as you and @suzywelch suggest
@PowerLunch ..Dennis thanks she loved it today with you guys
No surprise with Supreme choice. Republicans should grin and bear.  Fighting is a loser with well qualified Hispanic woman. Elections matter
N Korea continues to play US Administrations. No leader has been successful in reducing Nuclear threat. Need global sanctions incl China.
@jamesfarrar Why not..we want all views here
@ENLIGN amen
Finished the fried stuff. God save Lipitor
@anominy you were right. BUT
@Gearsy fun. We need one
@stevejpr agree
@DVBL love it. Thanks so much
Big treat today. Ride to Essex Mass with@suzywelch to eat best Fried Clams FF and onion Rings at Woodmans with cold draft. Summer is on.
@jamesfarrar loved the blog
Magic hanging on
@etcattlewoman milkngreat for Penske
@marceloasousa check out @suzywelch. Your suggestion almost got me stabbed:)
Magics have to win tonight. On TVin Toscana bar

@Philanthropic Pasta and salad
@suzywelch10-10-10 book #5 on NYT Bestsller List for 4th week in row. Celebrating with  wine at Toscana on Beacon Hill. Great casual food
@spiderhay I missed that good news. Hasn't he had over 200 starts on Tour? Nice job
Finished BW column. Time to play rest of Holiday
@fribeiro1 taking weekend off business although finishing BWweekly column on need for vigorous debate in bus and politics
@JLAssociatesLtd Roger is a friend. Not a fan
Red Sox must drop Ortiz down in batting order or rest with DL or bench. It is uncomfortable and wrong to see a past hero suffer publicly
Great news today "nice guys do finish first". Roger Penske wins another Indy 500. I am so happy for him
@BoomChuckalucca ill take 2of 3
@ValoremLamb agree
@davidgregory I think Gingrich Durbin debate was excellent. Liberal overstated perhaps but certainly left of center.  Nice closing remarks
MTP panel 3-1 liberal. Kills real discussion
@ peterek123 agree need new faces to carry same messages.
Clear that vast majority want to take Ortiz out of lineup and find dignified answer to his problem. DL list??
Great MTP debate coming up today. Two party stalwarts Durbin vs Gingrich go at it. At least it will be good discussion of policy
@mrezbiz at least you got one winner
@marcjean thanks for BW comment
@shaneharrishane me too but it was HR
Killer loss. Great Mets victory
Joe is old fashioned but will answer in his blog NYT.com/executivesuite Tues
In suite with NYT star business columnist Joe Nocera. He wrote about Ford  Today. Any questions for Joe
Not many response on Ortiz. Looking for real data
What would you do with Ortiz. We would love opinions
At Fenway Park with Luchinos down 1 but VERY optimistic tonight
Boy my lacrosse hopes got killed today Duke Virginia. Hope Red Sox do better against Mets tonight
Duke has goalie problem. Big one
Watchin great College Lacrosse semis on ESPN2. I'm for Duke and Virginia. My kids schools
Summary of24 hour sports tweet responses @jack_welch  Disagree with me on James shot--Jordan prefered  Agree on Lugo he bad  All sorry f ...
@literarystop last one always seems best but you may be right
What a finish to Cavs Magic game 2 great shots but James shot has to go down as "best ever"
@Gearsy cabrera You?
We have 2 real weak spots. Papi can no longer hit and Lugo is awful- no hit and No range
@mtangredi I'd like to see him traded. No hit No range
Lot of Mets fans here. Man can they holler. Lot more than Yankees do.
Papi doesn't look like Major leaguer. 2K's and DP. Hate to see it
Varitek Home run. Whata surprise. Poor Papi up now. Really sad to ser
@mrezbiz go Phillies
At Red Sox with @suzywelch and girls. Playing Mets and Santana. Toiugh game. Doubt if Papi has chance against Johan
@peterek123 Amen!!
@abhi_calling yes. Love him and have spent time with him over 20 years
@andrewminer I'll try but my tech skills are suspect
@NLindhardt certainly one side of issue
India national vote for Capitalism a huge deal in face of tough Gobal Economy

Check out how Minnesota is dealing with crazy runaway gvt spending vs NY and Calif approach
@stevebeste not in my view of world. Love 2 party system ...just not happy when D or R control everything
@stevebeste Demographics in Europe..birth rate low- pop.  Aging.  Politics not fav to Global econ battles
@cdsiebel very thoughtful response!!!
UK credit outlook downgrade  a Big Deal. Europe recovery will be longer and harder than US and LT outlook not promising. Demo and politics
@1MJRitter false? Where?
