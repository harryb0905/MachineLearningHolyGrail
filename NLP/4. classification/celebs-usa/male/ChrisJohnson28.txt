Yes he has potential to get there https://t.co/iMhUbLcJ1A

@Bryanakashima: @BenStancliff @TitanUpTalk @EddieGeorge2727 @ChrisJohnson28 @sportstakes_hot @dee_goodz @thereal_lendale @nwash85  @TitanTFup615 my bad he went for 1k but this was his 3rd year let’s ask the same question n a few more years cause I’m sure he will do great
My bad 1059 yards well even that number but don’t get me wrong I’m behind Henry I kno he gonna have a great career just to early for that comparison https://t.co/TWKqAAqWz8

@ecuathletics @ecupiratesfb great weekend https://t.co/gkloVskd5P
Went from a kid with one D1 offer to ECU hall of fame man it’s a blessing #GOD100 https://t.co/UzXlA9Cjdr
BIG THUGGIN https://t.co/nZ93Oh92KQ
Yes RT @antonior1986: @ChrisJohnson28 Are you retired yet?
The team should just do it player shouldn’t have to ask but don’t get me wrong it’s teams that do it!!! RT @the_real_stiner: @ChrisJohnson28 True. But it happens. Shouldnt be a 1 way street. You only hear about players wanting more $$$ when they outplay their contracts.
But y is it only accepted for the team to treat it like a bussiness instead of both sides RT @TitanTru00927: @ECUgrad05 @ChrisJohnson28 Do you think that the team is loyal when they cut or release a player? It's a business. Both sides should treat it as such.
Pay cut!!! But it’s so much stuff goes into underperforming RT @the_real_stiner: @ChrisJohnson28 If you underperform, gonna give some $$$ back??
🙌🙌🙌 RT @BuckelewCase: @ChrisJohnson28 And fans are guilty about expecting a player to be loyal to a team but not expecting the team to be loyal to the player
A organization loyalty is only measured by what they do with a player that don’t have no more guarantee on his contract
U can only measure the player loyalty once he have a chance to go where ever he wants and decide to stay because the team believed in the player and did what it took to put him and the team in the position to win even if he is not on the best team.
🙌🙌🙌🙌RT @ChafieFields: @ChrisJohnson28 The team will NEVER have loyalty to a player but players must learn to be loyal to each other! Sadly, I don’t see the level of loyalty that is necessary to make a difference in today’s game in the locker rooms or beyond.
So if a player don’t feel he is being treated right and out preforming his contract or the team not doing the right things to help the team win and that’s FA,Draft, etc. why stay loyal and not want a trade or leave when he have a opportunity too. Weigh in please
Ok my answer would be no from a nfl point of view. Because we don’t have guaranteed contracts so it’s so easy to cut players on the back end once all guaranteed is paid they can just release u and don’t care about loyalty!!!!
I’m gonna speak on this from a NFL point of view
So my boy JR SMITH POSTED THIS SO IM GONNA GIVE MY THOUGHTS https://t.co/z46ljuoKXZ
Ok I’m gonna start a new topic today let me think I will give my opinion then everybody else can response all answers is cool haters are allowed as well 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
I understand RT @LouCraneBlac: @ChrisJohnson28 Hope that cleared it up a bit. Much Respect Bro I'm a huge Titans fan!! What you did for that team was Legendary HOF
@LouCraneBlac Understood
And what is a black problem? RT @LouCraneBlac: @ChrisJohnson28 Sounds like a BLACK problem.

Smart idea RT @Leonard43070236: @ChrisJohnson28 You say whatever you want!! You have insight that most don’t. You should start a podcast!! I want to talk sports too!! From an average POC view point.
🙌🙌🙌 RT @WhittonAl: @ChrisJohnson28 Here’s to you 👍🏻 https://t.co/ekMirMfrTp
What’s wrong with speaking on a situation just like everybody else does it’s not accepted if your a former player or current player do I have to be on espn just to talk about things that’s going on around the NFL!!!!
Thx bro! Facts!!! RT @Mr_Farenheit_: @ChrisJohnson28 @JayCo5125 @dylawnb15 I still love CJ. He was a huge part of our '15 run and we kinda did him dirty toward the end. I can tell he is only speaking out cus he does care about the birdgang. Much respect for him still
I lost fans because I’m speaking facts and want better for a team that’s 1-5 RT @dylawnb15: @ChrisJohnson28 @JayCo5125 @Mr_Farenheit_ We loved you in AZ man, but you lost a lot of fans today. Maybe you should switch up the profile picture lol. Wish you the best
If IF WAS A 5th WE WOULD ALL BE DRUNK RT @JayCo5125: @ChrisJohnson28 @Mr_Farenheit_ @dylawnb15 You're obsessed with the Cardinals bro, if you weren't cut would they be good?
YELLOW TAPE THE LOT!!!!! BIG JRIP 📸 abstractvisuals_ https://t.co/Gqu4et3YZe
BIG JRIP https://t.co/amGZwAaGr7
U right bro 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ RT @chuckh3: @ChrisJohnson28 BA retired dude.  Your post is backwards.
Only speaking facts 1-5 speaks for itself RT @MrBenitezSr: @ChrisJohnson28 @AdamSchefter Youre talking a lot of shit about an organization who gave you a chance when no one else would. What have you done since then? Sell rims on IG? #youlostafan
U right no hate just speaking facts RT @ChasDad1: @ChrisJohnson28 Don't hate AZ, ur time was up in the NFL. Everyone has to retire or be retired.
He seem very healthy being a commentator every Sunday he will be back coaching just watch he wanted out of AZ just like everyone else
Right RT @Mr_Farenheit_: @ChrisJohnson28 @dylawnb15 They didn't put talent around him. You are right. They constantly neglected the oline(still do), they ignored WR issues, let their DBs go.
On GOD RT @Mathieu_Era: Come thru 5 @P2
Yes that’s what they want y’all to believe Az stressed BA out RT @dylawnb15: @ChrisJohnson28 He retired, genius
Then you let BA walk away. Shit is backwards over there
This speak alot about the organization and the front office when this guy no longer wants to be a part of it Az cardinals is not right u let go all ur top talent go RT @AdamSchefter: Cardinals continue to insist they’re not trading him - and Peterson continues to request a trade.
If u not gonna take it to overtime run D.henry on the 1

Yes just another example of low budget but smart move RT @Justbo1901: @ChrisJohnson28 You know the title is “Friday” not weekend. Day being the key word
And if u kno anything bout filming I️t takes 5-8 hours for a 30 sec commercial
I️t only took 20 days to shoot the whole movie
Low budget but ice cube wrote the movie so he the one really made all the money I️t was like a 50k budget
Criag and Smokey wore the same clothes the entire move
That’s the reason he didn’t do none of the other fridays RT @RMout29: @ChrisJohnson28 We would have went back to the table bih lol
Chris Tucker only made 5k for his part in Friday omg would have never guess that
