@julieannemery BBCA &amp; AMC are part of the same company so you should talk to PR for Preacher and let them know you NEED to be at Doctor Who "for work reasons"

@alexpardee Well played!
@jonhurwitz @stopit333 @ralphmacchio @WilliamZabka I mean, Alan, if we're being technical we waited 33 years for this series so one more year ain't a thang. ;)
@kristenschaaled And feathers in your butthole.
I just started watching Cobra Kai on YouTube and I legitimately love it. What an insanely cool take on the continuation of a movie I've seen probably 100 times. Nice work, @ralphmacchio &amp; @WilliamZabka!
I just assumed Angels drag their butts across clouds like a puppy on a rug https://t.co/cOjXrpwM1L
Unpopular Opinion: I think "Angel Soft" is a weird brand name for a toilet paper. I've never thought to myself, "Angels are such blissful, ethereal beings. I bet it would feel amazing to wipe my ass with one."
@jamileh @amazon @AmazonHelp I made a big purchase on Friday, but if that was the cause I don't understand the tactic of NEVER contacting me to verify the purchase, emailing a warning, giving me a different error upon sign in attempts other than "password failed". Such a strange way to treat customers.
@AmazonHelp Got it. Thank you! What do I do if I haven't been contacted within 12 hours? I'm tweeting at you because I wasn't contacted the last time cust serv said I would be. This whole process is baffling, though I do appreciate your responding!
@AmazonHelp ehhhhh....Thank you but I'm locked out of my account. I can't get to the secure link because I can't get into my account.
@AmazonHelp Good morning! Still no word from your company, still locked out of my account with no explanation. Please help?
@JTV42 @amazon @AmazonHelp No I found out because my account wouldn't let me in and told me that none of my sign in info was correct. I never got an email. I had to call to find out it was frozen. You'd think when signing in a simple "your account is frozen, here's what that means" message but nahhhhh.
Pffft. Everyone knows Daleks are 90% more likely to attack at Christmas time https://t.co/E77onAXJ1J
HEY @AmazonHelp PLEASE UNFREEZE MY ACCOUNT OR I‚ÄôM TELLIN YOUR DAD ON YOUUUUUU. #OooooooImTelliiiiiin https://t.co/8cycpuUdXF
I returned one thing last week, but it would be insane if their return policy was ‚Äúwe‚Äôll punish you for returning stuff, even if you buy way more stuff than you‚Äôve ever returned.‚Äù Seems like a dodgy business model. https://t.co/9tFMCeDLRh
Hey has anyone ever just had their @amazon account frozen for no reason? It's weird, the site said none of my info was correct so I called cust serv and they said, "Oh your account is frozen." "How come?" "I dunno. Someone will email you in 24 hrs." Weird. @AmazonHelp?
@joannacoggins83 Uhhhhh....3 weeks ago ;)

@buckchance But since it's on Wednesday this year will stretch into a 10 or 11 day holiday.
The entertainment business is hilarious. Monday's a holiday, so naturally the business shut down today, cuz ya know, Monday. Then some people even went as far as to take a half day Thursday, cuz ya know, Friday. Please allow me to shake my damn head lovingly but still... https://t.co/Ifdq7dYnUU

@NTBro I don't think they're doing much else with podcasts at the moment. I'm honestly not sure!
@NTBro Eh...I left Nerdist and took my podcast independent, which is why I changed the name. I'm not producing any other shows at the moment so I'm afraid I can't be of any help! Apologies....
Sorry to be negative, but it's a bummer that @instagram's glorious algorithm seems to be particularly crushing down charity posts.

@Rhett2Society @nerdist Thanks man! And congratulations!
IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING. We‚Äôre lining up some pretty fantastic guests which we‚Äôll announce soon.....I love doing this show. It has a chat show skin, but spiritually is a podcast with a comic con panel heart. Please watch it! https://t.co/cNoQqaHK2T

@PaoloMiguel74 What are you talking about??? Seriously. What is "not decent" about sharing someone's own gofundme page?
@rockabillygirl7 Nope! Not me.
@Jason_Hankins That's very nice of you! Thanks!
@riverguardian @scottgordonwi Look, there's no point in going back and forth about it, but it is an incredibly superior, belittling tone. He uses many words to say I'm boring, not really a stand-up, and a hack. The shows sold out a month ago. But I'm just a human being and it hurt my feelings. All fine now.
According to the @ToneMSN editor, David Wolinsky HAS seen me in the last couple of years so I am sorry for suggesting that he might not have and 100% support his right to hate my stand-up and express that in their publication. My sincere apologies to him &amp; Tone! Ok carry on! :) https://t.co/iPwwcAKBcc
@scottgordonwi David is 100% entitled to his opinion. Still, to be called "bland", "vapid", and basically a drooling moron for pop culture in addition to his framing of my work the way he did in a piece which shared the showtimes just bummed me out. Oh well. I'm sorry! Hope you have a good day.
@scottgordonwi I see it now. My apologies. But I still think he cherry picked a couple sillier bits and framed them in a way to make me look as empty and stupid as possible. The arc of that special was about my dad dying, which I think does hit "deeper", but that doesn't support his argument.
@riverguardian @scottgordonwi "Vapid", "bland", and suggesting that I'm too much a fanboy to form a real opnion. Also he cherry picked bits to ridicule them to make his point, but left out the entire arc of the special being about that "deeper" thing he claims I lack.
@scottgordonwi I'm not asking for anyone to kiss my ass. Just asking for fairness. And if you or your writers want to go at someone that hard &amp; mean--fine--but you should demand they have enough current experience w/ the thing they're going after to have an informed opinion. That's all!
@scottgordonwi PS - I invite you as well, Scott!
@scottgordonwi This is why I invited David to be my guest at a show. A responsbile journalist would take that challenge. If he hates it after that, then by all means dump on me. And if I'm wrong about his never seeing me live or anytime recently, I will happily publicly apologize.
@scottgordonwi But we evolve as performers. My last special was all about the death of my father, which you'd be hard pressed to call "bland". So that's why it reads fishy to me. Too many personal attacks and not anything about what it's like to see me live.
@scottgordonwi If you want to be in the ragebait buisness, that's fine, but you should also be prepared to be called out for it. See, other people get to form opnions about your opinions. Look, I'll be honest, I can't watch my first special. It makes my skin crawl. But it's almost a decade old.
@scottgordonwi It's clear that he hates my guts, and that's fine. Look, I would march in the streets to protect his right to expressing his opinion. I just highly doubt that he has enough information to form such an opinion to effectively try to tank my shows (which sold out a month ago).
@scottgordonwi Scott, it's clear from what he's referencing and the clip he posted that he formed this opinion 8 years ago. I'd say the vitriol of that piece was far worse than being suspicious of how current his opinion is. If he's never seen me live, you don't see that as a problem?
@ScottAukerman @ToneMSN Thanks man! It's just mean. And the guy is referencing an 8 year old special. I don't think he's even bothered to see anything as of late. Why even bother telling people about showtimes if you're just gonna eviscerate them? What a puzzling move.
@SethGoodtime Get better and heal up damn you! :D
This fella, @SethGoodtime, is a hashtag warrior of the highest order! He's healing up, but wanted to share his gofundme page. He had a really rough weekend, so I'm sharing in hopes that it gets better! https://t.co/FXlKEXdoh5

@michaelianblack He's one of those guys that you think, "Oh he can't ever die!" What a bummer.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I loved this guy even though I had never met him. Loved his comedy, his appearances on SNL (when they still had stand-ups), and Night Court is one of my all-time favorite sitcoms.

If I devoted 10 minutes to talking about it, that's different and would suck for fans who want to talk about Walking Dead, but otherwise it's just not that big of a deal.
@DarinSCampbell @susanStrode @AMCTalkingDead @StevenOgg @cserratos @GameOfThrones Eh...it was a fuggin joke, Darin. I don‚Äôt care that she mentioned GoT. I‚Äôve mentioned it before myself. It‚Äôs a great show!
@logosgnosis1 Oh I know you were making with the jokes! But we really do love doing this stuff!
So the plan is that tomorrow from 1-3p PT, @wilw &amp; I are doing a livestream to discuss the GIF/JIF topic and the Team Hard G/Team Soft G shirts we made. Gonna try to simulcast on my FB &amp; Insta (@hardwick) &amp; Twitch (.tv/id10t). JOIN THE RIGHT SIDE
@logosgnosis1 #1, I would never take money from someone else. Ya know, cuz I have dignity and stuff (I have a couple of pretty good jobs myself). Also Lyds has an AMAZING eye for I.D. and we enjoy doing it ourselves. But I know you were just being snarky :)
@verbalhamradio @HearstCastleSHM That might be a little TOO high end ;)
All right, google sleuths...I need help finding antique tile for a fireplace surround. Early 20th century or older, preferably Arts &amp; Crafts Style a la William Morris. Victorian is ok, or anything that just looks neato. And....GO! #HouseShit
@brubaker_joshua Because she said "shit" a couple of times and our TV rating doesn't allow that, so they dropped it out.
@moranclan @RamboDonkeyKong @AMCTalkingDead @SonsofAnarchy ‚ÄúStole‚Äù implies that any of us saw what you‚Äôre talking about and knowingly took the idea. I can assure you we didn‚Äôt. Steve was VERY eager not to have that thing anymore. :)
@dookiej78 When I don‚Äôt people complain. Truly. But thanks for proving that people complain no matter what ;)
@CoachTeachMrT @AMCTalkingDead We aired 20 episodes and we‚Äôre shooting 20 more for season 3 in the fall
@SaraTheBrown The other two were ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù and If ‚ÄúI Understood You Would I Have This Look On My Face‚Äù
@Rhahlene Next time, I would love to guest list you. I can tell you from experience that this WILL get easier. I promise you will be okay and I admire your strength for even leaving the house that soon. I have much respect for that and thank you for coming. More hugs!!!
@Rhahlene Oh no I‚Äôm so so sorry! That‚Äôs how lo lost my dad too. I have all the sympathy in the world for you and I send you hugs. My deepest apologies and condolences. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@tmack8001 No next week‚Äôs
@kaylamax Glad y‚Äôall had fun!
ICYMI @alanalda was so cool on the recent @id10t podcast. His latest book "If I Understood You Would I Have This Look On My Face" is all about communication, and how he used improv classes to help some scientists become better communicators. Thanks, Alan!  https://t.co/4iABq2ulHV
@peyton_mcbride @Apey @phirm Thanks for coming!
@kaylamax Ok you‚Äôre set for tonight just shoot a tweet if you have an issue.
@kaylamax You got it
@JayFralick Thank you!
@kaylamax How many of you?
@BabsGray @ComedyWorks Great set!!! Thanks for doing it!!
@kaylamax Sure early or late?
@kaylamax I‚Äôm so sorry! I‚Äôll make sure you get into any other show if you want!
@DenverBiscuitCo We‚Äôre going to the Broadway location! 10 min...
@chadbarnier I really did! I recommend it.
@ThunderLevin @TheWalkingDead @AMCTalkingDead @ScottMGimple They haven‚Äôt been in the apocalypse for 8 years. In fact, the last two seasons have only comprised maybe a month or two. WHAT SHOW ARE YOU WATCHING?? ;)
@DenverBiscuitCo I am coming for your delicious biscuits tomorrow. FYI.
Headed off to @ComedyWorks Denver today through Sat w/ @phirm &amp; @Apey!Also super excited to see @katemicucci‚Äôs work hanging at the airport before we took off!!! https://t.co/c2qFh50otr
@ThunderLevin @TheWalkingDead @AMCTalkingDead @ScottMGimple They've been in Virginia for quite a while now so maybe you should explain why you thought they were still in Atlanta ;)
@lance_switzer Soon!
@MattMira @id10t Only 3?
Yes! Nov 3 &amp; 4 at the Orange County Fairgrounds. Lineup announcing soonish! @id10t https://t.co/jq2PykpAry
@taddgood We're shooting it this fall! Then not long after that.
Whether you're a wrestling fan or not, @JohnCena was SPECATULAR on the podcast and worth a listen. He's a great dude with so much great insight into @WWE &amp; life in general. Also, #BlockersMovie is super fun and out Friday! https://t.co/4iABq2LWzt @BlockersMovie @id10t
@WWEFrontRow @JohnCena @jonahray @id10t @BlockersMovie Wasn‚Äôt he great?? Loved chatting with him.
@samanthamarie It will hit but that‚Äôs what the original plans were. It‚Äôs an old entry powder room ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@JesseThorn @almadrigal @wkamaubell @kasper_hauser I send you hugs posthaste, my talented friend! #SpicyPonyHead
@amcleod I mean from his point of view he‚Äôs just doing business with a bunch of backstabbing bar owners. (Great great gf)
@mland_19 So you can complain? ;)
@Shawna @AMCTalkingDead @RonFunches  https://t.co/GhftFnvaKB
Amazing /r/ObscureMedia find. @marcmaron in the 90s fielding angry @MST3K fan calls/compuserve emails w/ @ComedyCentral head of scheduling for changing timeslot from midnight to 8pm. Where is this whole video?? @jonahray don't change the @netflix timeslot. https://t.co/eYv10y1b3t
@emilynoel156 @annefrances @id10t @SchittsCreek Awwwwww yeah! @lydiahearst &amp; I love that show. And I just met @danjlevy at an event last month and he was a damn delight!
@DemonProtocol We'll add it to the watch list! @LydiaHearst
@Shawna @AMCTalkingDead @RonFunches RON IS LITERALLY THE BEST PERSON
@kevinasbell @midnight I miss it too! But I don't miss the schedule! Just the show and wiener jokes.
@kilmarnok1285 @kharypayton Pollyanna signed them and we gave them out to the audience ;)
@the6ixthsaint @spikeferesten Not yet!
@kevinasbell It's still the highest rated show on cable but I know you weren't asking to get a real answer. ;)
@dpartenio @AMCTalkingDead Yesssssssssss! GOOD EYE.
Tis blue! Or purple. Ah shit. I dunno. It‚Äôs another one of those dress argument thingies. https://t.co/14g7bOIaVz
One hour until @AMCTalkingDead! @PollyAMcIntosh &amp; a Surprise Cast Member PLUS I‚Äôll be reunited with POINTS Baron @RonFunches! Join us, won‚Äôt you?
@DavidPressman Talking Head heyooooooooooo
@BeardedMangus @edhelms I started the Japanese track on Rosetta and it‚Äôs immersive! I enjoyed it. It likely would have worked had I stuck with it.
We just watched a really cool sci-fi-esque thriller called Radius on the itunes if you're looking for one this weekend. Guy wakes up from a crash to discover that anyone who comes within 50 ft of him dies instantly (not a spoiler, it's the description). It's rad! @steeveleonard
@danicamckellar @HowardTKatz TOM LEHRER!!! https://t.co/4drPpHRKyi
@danicamckellar @StevenS757 That's exactly right, DM! Oooooooo it stings to swing and miss when you're trying to correct someone! ;) Anyway Steven, since you're not aware of what "e" is here's some info to expand your horizons: https://t.co/HIeL0foab5
@dwolfmeyer @NerdMelt heh I 100% could not buy it. it's not for sale and that space is insanely expensive on one of the busiest streets in the country. funny how many people have juust assumed this is a super easy option.
@X_TinaFey16 Lyds got them on ebay I think
So @edgarwright's video for @beck's Colors w/ @alisonbrie is FUCKING FANTASTIC. I already loved the song but video makes it even better. It's on Apple Music. BRAVO Y'ALL. #ImSouthern
It's so meaningful to me to have created and been a part of something that really grew into its own little ecosystem. I LOVE YOU @NERDMELT. Thanks @LAmag for putting together this tribute. https://t.co/BKonZT7CJX
Hey Denver! I'll be at @ComedyWorks downtown next weekend! of the 5 shows only 2 have tix left so grab em!! here's a link -&gt; https://t.co/63JxCMquMV
@Jbokse Ugh this again. I love the show. I truly do. But it doesn‚Äôt matter what I say, people who don‚Äôt agree will usually come up with a reason about how I‚Äôm lying because how could someone have an opinion that‚Äôs different from theirs? I‚Äôd pay money for THAT to stop.
Three point one four one five nine two six five three five eight...: https://t.co/YrGMHwOxbx
@Hubb4rd90 Thank you!
@H3r0Ty I think they still have my broom.
@Zuzyque123 The goo is a highly infectious substance. If you get cut with it it's the same as getting bitten. If you smear enough of it on your face and body it can get into your eyes, nose, mouth, cuts--some people might fall ill, some might get lucky. The same as any infectious agent. :)
@NotThatJoanna What kind of car?
@AmberTozer @cbisgard @marcmaron @mentalpod @RecoveryElev @ThisNakedMind @sarahhepola Let me echo this! CONGRATULATIONS!!!
@shadipetosky @serathegamble Now I can't stop singing in my head "Take me down to the Paradox City where the grass is green and the grass isn't green...Oh won't you please take me and not take me down yea eeee yeahhhhhh"
@AdminPopCultRev An all musical season would be pretty epic!! Is it covers or originals? Probably a mix of both.
@AdminPopCultRev Nope I haven't. If you're not watching the show you would have zero idea what this is referring to or even which season. Unless you were just going for a finger pointy rush of superiority, which is not uncommon on the internet. But in this case you are mistaken. Sorry! ;) https://t.co/YLFf0ZUuX5
@serathegamble annoying nerdy panel type question! ok...so does each timeline have its own underworld?? or does the underworld sort that out?? When 50 versions of someone dies, where do they all go? Asking for a friend who is me.
@marcosMN @AMCTalkingDead Hey I thought the same thing!!!
@timewalkyrwho Sadly, no. I was just there in Sept.
Comedy on State, end of April! #Wisconsin https://t.co/L4QMcnZlxO
@bribaker23 Yeah cuz who could have an opinion that wasn‚Äôt the same as yours right? https://t.co/LNbSWvwaTM
@MrRandall_ESPN @AMCTalkingDead HIGH FIVE
@snappy627 Not yet! Will get back into it soon.
@mrlumptastic Jambo House at animal kingdom! Loved it.
@snappy627 Me too!!!
Also I just mostly sledgehammered a shitty door for #HouseShit over on @instagram stories...feels good man (username: hardwick)
Hey I just started the ID10T @Twitch channel. It's fun to start from scratch! Streaming stuff coming soon -&gt; https://t.co/fTSVs6hnZw
@RobertKirkman CHEATING BASTARD
@timdrake THANK YOU for being a part of it!!!
@NPash22 Been available for a week! Not sure the issue. Don‚Äôt think anyone else is having it. Maybe @kt_money can help?
@Miketok471 Trying to get a couple things!
@SickGamingLive Dude! They're a huge store on one of the most expensive streets in America. Maybe they charged what they needed to to stay open. But way to bring some needlessly negative bullshit to a thing we're bummed about. Nice work today.
It's truly the end of an era. Meltdown was home to such a wonderful community and I am grateful to have been a part of it. Thank you, Gaston &amp; Co, and the wonderful team of interns, staff, &amp; performers who made it so special. üò¢ https://t.co/Jz5ZWCzi1A

@Jody_FMS_Carter @AMCTalkingDead Well that's a poop face if I've ever seen one. #NegansShittinPants
@jessica_hulk @midnight @midnight will always be with you...
@jprestera Let‚Äôs loop in @kt_money to trouble shoot!
@ZacCrampton Your grief is understandable. Forgiven! :)
@Jeremy_EF5 Yeesh! Ghastly!
@ZacCrampton Right but the world desperately needs multiple tweets about how you went to a comedy show https://t.co/n2ls8u29Ny
@CHRI5HA11 Being wounded and getting the blood in the wound is effectively the same as a bite, according to Negan‚Äôs hypothesis.
@walkingdeadnow_ @AMCTalkingDead How about a happy birthday tweet??
@julieredl @NerdistMom That‚Äôs what editors are supposed to catch!!! But in 60k words dumb mistakes do happen...
@AnthonyQuintano how do you think I knew they were trying to access it ;)
@CAHarrisMD @id10t Hi! I hear you and it's something I really am aware of. Just so you know, we do try to even out the numbers and get turned down...A LOT. So it's not a lack of effort, I promise! But we will continue to strive to do better, I promise! Ok have a great Saturday!! :)
Ah dang it someone‚Äôs trying to get my twitter password again. Just a heads up in case my account starts sending out batshit tweets all of a sudden! In the meantime let‚Äôs play a game. #BadTwitterPasswords for instance, password
@LyssaPearl Ooooooo interesting idea...do you think wood, brick, and tin is too much texture?
@andyseff @LydiaHearst We do.
I've been neck deep in #HouseShit but a couple years ago @LydiaHearst designed a vintage icebox facade for our refrigerator to pay homage to the iceboxes at Hearst Castle. She's got the goods. See below!!! https://t.co/btMH8UtEAK
@chasingcarly I agree, I hear you, and I do think about it! What you don't see is behind the scenes. Most people come on because they ask to. We try to even the gap but lots of people pass on doing the show. But we do try! And will continue to do so!! Thanks, Carly! :)
@ServoWHU42 @depechemode Thank you!
I've taken over @depechemode's FB page today! I'm Behind the Wheel so try Walking in My Shoes &amp; you Just Can't Get Enough of the World in My Eyes but if you don't Enjoy The Silence of My Stripped Strangelove it's just a Question of Time before it's over. https://t.co/MYSEgCV3rt

This week on @id10t podcast! @RobertKirkman &amp; @serafinowicz are up! Peter shares "A Full Day in the Life" (listen to find out). Grab Kirkman's "Oblivion Song" and watch Peter as "The Tick" on @amazon! Maybe watch #LookAroundYou again too.
@ThatTroyChriest Nope! Not in the slightest. We actually went up a bit.
@HalSparks True enough
Can any @apple folks or @ATTCares folks help @jonahray??? https://t.co/10bQjJJbO3
@chavonia I don't see anything yet in the inbox!

@chavonia Ah ok. I'm going to do some research on that. I remember being told when I was a kid that it's not a great idea to microwave empty dishware, mugs, glasses but I honestly can't remember who told me that or why. I'll dig around on that. In the meantime, please be careful!
@chavonia Absolutely understand and agree! I want people to be safe and happy! I'll keep investigating!! Please let me know if you figure anything out with it. Thank you, Tracie!
@chavonia Did you microwave it empty? It looks like there isn't anything in there.
@chavonia Ah jeez. Ok I'll let know you what else I find out. In the meantime please get me your mailing info so I can get you some other TD stuff if you want! Again, my apologies, Tracie! Email -&gt; stuff@nerdist.com
@chavonia I just microwaved mine for 3 minutes to where the water inside was boiling and it didn‚Äôt happen (I took video of it). What were you microwaving and for how long? I really do want to figure this out with you!
@chavonia Tracie I‚Äôm so so sorry! I checked with the manufacturer &amp; they assure me that everything about it is microwave safe. I‚Äôm having them dig deeper but so far you‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs reported an issue. But I‚Äôm still digging! Meantime may I send you a basket of TD stuff?
@CoulterX @nerdist @StarTrek @AshvsEvilDead Nerdist will always be a thing! Even though the podcast changed, the symbol of enjoying your burrito and embracing who you are is relevant. Or it could rep a specific time in your life. And if you don‚Äôt agree, the symbol is still a warning sign for an active laser in a lab! :D
@Nialls_Nandosx3 No we‚Äôre home now!
This guy seems to know what‚Äôs up! https://t.co/EGk6VSuMQB
@daveweigel Aha! Ours didn‚Äôt either flight. The blue WiFi light mocked me the entire time.
Hey just a consumer heads up! I think Delta‚Äôs internet is down. At least, it was for our flight Mon and again for another one today. Flight attendant said the airline was ‚Äúhaving issues‚Äù. Not sure if it‚Äôs all flights but just letting you know in case you were planning to do work!
@TheRealBigDoody @LydiaHearst Yes :(
@CheyTown331 not awkward at all! thanks for saying hi! hope you had a magical time! Lyds and I are EXHAUSTED from hitting the 4 parks.
@michaelham1967 @TWD @talking It‚Äôs about not texting while you are driving because people get injured that way :)
@TheNoblet @id10t @eliroth @ManMadeMoon Indeed!
I was working on the zombie show last night so I didn‚Äôt see any of the Oscars but just saw @TiffanyHaddish clip &amp; would like to cast my vote for her to host. Not sure a lowly tv guy‚Äôs vote counts but there it is! We were out late &amp; are on a plane now. What else did I miss??
@WhoKilledLaura1 Oh yeah! That was another house I renovated years ago. I sold it when Lydia and I moved into another place together.
@THE_NIIIIICK @WalkingDead_AMC Well then don‚Äôt watch it! Problem solved. And thanks! Safe travels! Excited for Disneyworld. We go to Disneyland all the time but haven‚Äôt been to the other one since I was a kid. Though I hear Epcot is great and the Avatar stuff at Animal Kingdom is worth seeing too.
@THE_NIIIIICK @WalkingDead_AMC Great so Pirates at noon then.
@CraigHaasis @WalkingDead_AMC @AMCTalkingDead It‚Äôs a wristband from a fancy party that I‚Äôm going back to
@Kbev02 Ha! It‚Äôs a wristband from the event I came from!
@HaaveYouMetBran When I don‚Äôt people think something is wrong! I‚Äôll try to remember not to do it though.
@THE_NIIIIICK @WalkingDead_AMC Good to know! Going to Disneyworld this week too, btw. Maybe we‚Äôll get to say hi!!
@StephStricklen @aweiss @Schnik @wilw @kateesackhoff @neilhimself @isaiahmustafa @Kiala Well not "drinks"...coffees maybe? In any case, congratulations on an AMAZING run. Truly. 10 years is a super accomplishment in TV!!! Thank you for letting me be a tiny part of it! :D
@TheDaneMen @thevlognerd Love your work! Hope you don't mind my sharing your piece! I credited and linked to you, of course. People loved it! Just donated to your kickstarter as a thank you.
@The_Dr_Defense Keep up the good work, Other Hardwick!

@Doener @verotruesocial PS I‚Äôm open to any other suggestions if you have them
@Doener @verotruesocial I was bitching about FB a couple weeks ago so someone recommended it and I tried it. I‚Äôm not sold on it yet. Just looking for alternatives.
@Doener @verotruesocial What? No! I would have to disclose that if I did! I don‚Äôt know these people at all. I just want to find an alternative to FB/Insta turning into ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù social networks. If people follow you they should be able to see your posts &amp; not have it go through a ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù filter.
@TheXxEnforcerXx THANK YOU MATT!!! :)
Congratulations @SteveMartinToGo! I saw this show live last year and it was fantastic! Everyone should watch this when it comes out. I mean it. EVERYONE. I will find you if you don't and monitor you while you watch it. AND NO BATHROOM BREAKS. Ok I'm glad we understand each other. https://t.co/U8lXhwRnBZ
@JasonK7878 I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, Jason. That is a very lovely sentiment and I thank you for sharing it with me!
@AlfredandPoe @id10t Oh it‚Äôs gonna happen! Probably in the next month or so.
@bfarthing83 @TheWalkingDead What would you like us to say about something which I have no information about? Greg and Chandler obviously know and can't talk about it and there's no guest to speculate with me so how exactly did you imagine that playing out? :)
@janew44 Nope! Not that I'm aware of!
@FallenSputnik @Lousroom @ijustine @YTCreators And I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre smart enough to understand that I mean they won‚Äôt use algorithms to prioritize your posts, forcing you to pay to boost them which is why people are flocking away from FB/Instagram. :)
@ijustine How so? Just got on. Have only just started playing with it. Would love some feedback.
Holy shit. @ThatKevinSmith seems to be okay but he almost wasn't. Kev is a wonderful force of good and humor in this world and I'm proud to be his friend. We are lucky we didn't lose him so PLEASE send him HUGS!!! https://t.co/TLYz1mrsh1

Any Latin teachers out there? I'm trying to get a close translation approximation to "We are all insignificant". Is "Omnes Nos Humilem" close? It was my high school language but that was in the 1900s.
@HaydenGrace @id10t @eliroth @ManMadeMoon Thank you!

@steffikuss It really did sound like an actual baby!
@jdoogie I always wondered that too. I might need to pose that question to the audience at my show tonight and see how they respond.
@jgold85 @phil_torres I've been randomly posing this question at my stand-up shows for the last couple of years and it sends the crowd into an UPROAR. People draw hard lines on this one. It's a more universal gif/jif debate! #HardG

@Nialls_Nandosx3 November!
ICYMI two fantastic guests this week on the @id10t podcast BOTH without twitter accounts but BOTH with movies you should see this weekend! Natalie Portman in @AnnihilationMov &amp; Jesse Plemons in #GameNight. Get out of your house and be communal, I say!
This is a really cool project, Shawn! https://t.co/1km6HztOTC
@gavinmorin97 @id10t @CW_Riverdale @colesprouse @lilireinhart @kj_apa @CamilaMendes Cole needs to come on and talk D&amp;D
When you see someone's name trending what's the first thing you think?
@RyanHoliday LOVED "Ego". Been recommending it. Next time you're in LA please come chat on my podcast! And just for fun, Orson Welles wasn't entirely without ego -&gt; https://t.co/U5ViFJFkLZ #TeamHearst
@NTBro Since you're in the club, let me recommend a book I just finished and LOVED. It's called "Ego Is the Enemy" by Ryan Holiday. And for the record, my mistake was letting your tweet get to me and respond sharply. So I'm sorry for THAT. We're even! :)
@NTBro Congratulations on your sobriety!!! That's a huge deal man. And don't sweat it. Literally everyone falls victim to the social media trap at one point or another. Mistakes are good. They remind us we're human and give us a chance to evolve and do better.
@NTBro I 100% accept your apology. This exchange is EXACTLY what I was talking about. Most people wouldn't have accepted a shred of responsibility. I applaud and thank you! You're way ahead of the game! :)
@NTBro @nerdist @id10t ID10T is all about "user error". Taking responsibility for one's own actions, an idea that is very important to me right now. It's what I believe is the secret sauce to growing up, and a VITAL piece of sobriety. Also sadly lacking in our culture. But It's not an arbitrary name.
@NTBro @nerdist @id10t And if you really want to talk about a freshman trying to sound like a creative writing big boy, look no further than "Intelligent Drivel‚Ñ¢ by the Internet's original men's wear vigilante." FYI. Since we're enjoying unsolicited honesty with each other.
@NTBro @nerdist @id10t Tell you what, don't listen. The negativity is unwelcome here. I explained why it changed. Nerdist isn't mine &amp; I had little choice. Sincerely, if you can't see past the appreciation of your own obnoxious snark that "soul" lies in pursuing passion then you REALLY don't get it. :)
Always loved the movie Dark City but watching the director‚Äôs cut for the first time. SO MUCH BETTER. It‚Äôs way less choppy and the story fits together in a more linear way. It‚Äôs one of those films you watch a lot and pick up something new each time. Highly recommended!
@KevinLaSean Thank you! I really do love the process so much!! :D

@swimmingeezer @ChrisGethard @colbertlateshow haaa! No but that's amazing. Gethard is hilarious!
@TXClaCla Yes! It's always been a scheduling issue. But he is one of the best stand-ups/writers working today.
@sacca Ha! So you were able to do it at least once! I am jealous.
The next couple of weeks we'll be posting bonus episodes of @id10t podcast! Today, Jesse Plemons, who is honestly one of my favorite actors working today -&gt; https://t.co/vXNWCBKetf
In the 2 decades I've been using USB connectors I don't think I have EVER put one in properly without having to flip it over. Not. One. Time.
@JennBig NICE!!! Congratulations!!!
@mattgatewood Should be in the next couple months! Sadly, it takes a long time to actually manufacture them.
Aw man! I did the same thing with Deadwood. Thanks for watching it! I miss that @midnight show. https://t.co/zABzuczZqf
@Cippyzero Ego Is The Enemy. Good book for keeping oneself in check! I loved it.
@brookenelson197 @chandlerriggs @DavidKHarbour @y I see it! Stay strong!!! Sending HUGS! :)
Welp, I‚Äôve gone full cat person. Last week I posted a pic of Anubis and folks seemed to enjoy its awkwardness, so now I‚Äôm doing an awkward cat photo contest at https://t.co/OX88l7ii01. You have until tomorrow night to post there, winner gets one of my @OriginalFunko toys signed! https://t.co/GUmStiAvQg
SEE YOU THERE https://t.co/ZtPj22lhXB
@marthalindout In any event, no ill will intended! Thank you for caring, listening, and having a constructive chat. Best of luck with school and all of your activities! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
@marthalindout None of those things make you entitled! That‚Äôs admirable work! But social media/algorithms/helicopter parents have conditioned SOME folks to think everything is about/focused on them and if not they flip TF out. But it‚Äôs silly of me to suggest that‚Äôs EVERYONE. It‚Äôs not!
@marthalindout Oh gosh did I say that? I‚Äôm sorry! I honestly forget what I say almost as soon as it‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs all short term memory! I rarely know what I repeat since some of these record weeks apart. But I understand that you hear them all together so it must sound repetitive sometimes.
@marthalindout Even telling me I am also tired of it because that‚Äôs how you feel...other people have different points of view. It‚Äôs ok to own your own opinion. But again, I SWEAR no disrespect meant! Just critiquing your critique! :D
@marthalindout To be fair, YOU have the most control  whether or not you hear it. And with all due respect, not liking something and expecting IT to change to suit YOUR exact prefs is ironically one of the very things we talk about. ;) Thank you and please don‚Äôt hate me!

He was Bruce in the comics. On TV, he was technically "David Bruce Banner" (according to his tombstone) but went by Dr. David Banner. Actually, he changed his last name every episode to conceal his identity because he was supposed to have died in a Hulk-related lab accident. https://t.co/wR6BQrPmmz
Btw, I've been re-watching the Incredible Hulk TV series and it's really fun particularly if you like crying during a superhero show. SADDEST. SHOW. EVER. (but I love it)
@NovasityR No, David. Because it was a reference to the TV show. I don't blame you for trying to correct me though! :D
Ahhhh Millennials. He was David on the Incredible Hulk tv show: https://t.co/PawZJyIsE6 #ImOld https://t.co/VzCePJ3kvY

@JonSchnepp @crmotwo I loved the creature so so much
@gregyusi @netflix The only boobs are the four protagonists...
@crmotwo Really? I loved the creature! Good creatures are hard to come by.
Hey if you‚Äôre looking for a good horror flick ‚ÄúThe Ritual‚Äù on @netflix is pretty rad
@entertainedmatt @mosseri @facebook @instagram heh heh well even if he was following me on facebook there's a better than average chance he'd never see it.
@thekevinryder @kevinandbean grrrrrrr! I'm mildly annoyed I tells ya!!
@FluffyBunnyAsh Civil idea exchanges are a dying art!!! We have to do whatever we can to keep them alive!!! Also, I don't think I know all that much, so I'm always open to learning! :)
@FluffyBunnyAsh @nerdwithus But look, you wouldn‚Äôt need a billion people for a new social network to succeed. So it‚Äôs not impossible, just harder now. And again, FB either tries to buy or copy their competitors‚Äô best features, effectively burying them. So that‚Äôs the other hurdle.
@FluffyBunnyAsh @nerdwithus They do but the data point you‚Äôre forgetting is that that was the dawn of social media. No one was too embedded in a platform yet since it was all new and the platforms themselves were not too deep so uprooting and starting over wasn‚Äôt as big a deal. Not so much the case anymore.
@FifthOf55 Oh damn!! That‚Äôs rad!! I‚Äôll DM you an address! Thank you!!
@krissylenz Hey if you and your husband come to the dressing room door I‚Äôll take a pic for sitting through TWO shows!
@FabGrandma Glad to hear that!
@FabGrandma from our honeymoon!
@lucyannebridge I can't say for sure because I haven't seen the episode but I don't think anyone is immune.
@FluffyBunnyAsh I absolutely agree! Your point is 100% valid. If attempting to get FB into a dialogue about the changes doesn't work that will be my next plan.
@FluffyBunnyAsh I know that seems like the simple answer but it isn't. Creators have no place else to go to reach their audiences since FB absorbed most of the internet traffic that used to go to websites and blogs. Just deleting would be devastating for people who can't afford to pay for reach.
I invite @mosseri or anyone else from @facebook &amp; @instagram to come on my podcast &amp; talk respectfully about the changes to FB/Insta. A lot of people are deeply affected &amp; we should have a dialogue. I'm sure there are things both sides are missing so let's talk! Meaningfully! :)
@styggian @ExpanseSYFY I've heard it's GREAT. Will get to it at some point for sure. @SYFY is making some really solid shows these days.
@seattlewebsites And I can think of several PEOPLE who aren't brands who are being destroyed because they can no longer reach their audience. We're just going to have to respectfully disagree on this because we're making different points. Have a nice day! :)
@seattlewebsites Wow is that a false equivalency. I‚Äôll give you a backpeddle pass on that one. It was a nice try, but...c‚Äômon. People‚Äôs livelihoods aren‚Äôt destroyed if the chicken recipe changes every month. If you want to debate AT LEAST bring a good argument to the table. Not rotten chicken. ;)
@seattlewebsites Because that was not the nature of the relationship when people were lured away. And I‚Äôm not talking about for me, since I can pay to boost if I need to. But for people who can‚Äôt afford to do that who are now screwed. They can‚Äôt go back to empty websites now, sadly.
@teamashen The neutrality point was meant to illustrate that this is how ISPs will operate eventually, so it‚Äôs a preview of what‚Äôs to come. NOT that the algorithm in this case is the result of non NN.
@MAGICvsSCIENCE Ha I first read that as ‚Äúmoney RULES!!!‚Äù
@SCORPDLM @standuplive Oh noooooo! If you come by before the show tomorrow I‚Äôll take a pic with you!
@LateGreatHenry Yup and then they changed the nature of the relationship based on rules that they won‚Äôt share. Now there‚Äôs not really anywhere else for a lot of people to go to reach their audiences.
@GIRLvsDUMB @DemonKingOda Well I think we‚Äôre just talking in circles here. Thank you for taking the time to chat respectfully! And I hope this social media stuff plays it positively for you! Have a great night! :)
@GIRLvsDUMB @DemonKingOda Again, I‚Äôm not saying what they‚Äôre doing should be illegal. I swear I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not sure why we‚Äôre back to that? It‚Äôs about the transparency. So people understand how their information is being controlled. The transparency. #transparency
@GIRLvsDUMB @DemonKingOda And if you want to know why there aren‚Äôt more options for social media, please just do a bit of research on what happens to competitors with superior tech. The larger companies either absorb them or in many cases, just flat out copy their innovation and bury them.
@GIRLvsDUMB @DemonKingOda Ok AGAIN...I‚Äôm not saying the paywall should be illegal. Can we agree on that? I‚Äôm not at all saying that. It‚Äôs the lack of transparency with the algorithm that shouldn‚Äôt be allowed when it controls so much commerce. Why do you keep thinking I‚Äôm saying they shouldn‚Äôt make money?
@GIRLvsDUMB @DemonKingOda In Europe, they‚Äôre experimenting with companies having to be transparent about how their algorithms work. That‚Äôs not fascism. That‚Äôs fair. Especially when so many people have to use it to keep their businesses alive.
@DemonKingOda @GIRLvsDUMB Imagine if Walmart ran every other business out of your town and then started dictating what you could and couldn‚Äôt buy. What do you do? Where else do you guy? ‚ÄúWell just stop eating and don‚Äôt buy food‚Äù isn‚Äôt a real option.
@DemonKingOda @GIRLvsDUMB And if you‚Äôre a creator...where else do you go? They absorbed most of the internet traffic and then changed the rules. People don‚Äôt go to websites/blogs much anymore so creators are screwed. If your livelihood doesn‚Äôt rely on reaching your audience, it‚Äôs hard to understand.
@DemonKingOda @GIRLvsDUMB Yes!!! That‚Äôs exactly what I meant. Not being transparent about how they‚Äôre throttling information to users who actually wanted to follow that information.
@GIRLvsDUMB @DemonKingOda If that‚Äôs what you took away from that, there‚Äôs a fundamentally misunderstanding of the issue. Determining which content people should be allowed to see unless creators pay them is the issue. Not just putting up ads. How did you get that takeaway? I‚Äôm curious...
@BradfordBenn I hear ya! The algorithm favors the users, not the creators, which is ironic considering the creators are very helpful for helping to post the content that draws in the users. Then once these companies have what they want, they shove the creators aside. They should service both!
@BradfordBenn Sorry but I disagree harder. What you fail to understand is that the big social media platforms effectively killed websites/blogs, so creators actually have a very hard time reaching their audiences any other way. Might want to get that myopia checked, sir! ;)
@hijinksensue At the end of the day, if people take the time to follow you, they should see your posts. End of story. They are so CONSUMER focused they forget that CREATORS make a lot of the stuff that brings the CONSUMERS in the first place, and they brush us aside. Every. Platform.
@jrbates81 Of course! But the few platforms people use are hobbling anything that seems to promotional (unless you want to pay for reach) and sadly, people don't go to websites/blogs the way they used to. If I had Amazon $ I'd start a social media platform myself but I don't!
@jrose0418 @standuplive ALWAYS
If you're in #Phoenix I'll be at @standuplive tonight-Sat! Come on out! Tix here for whomever actually sees this -&gt; https://t.co/LcMr3uWCin
@mosseri @AnthonyQuintano No disrespect meant, but the subtle arrogance of this statement is in the assumption that you know what‚Äôs important to people instead of letting them decide. Still totally game for that convo! Happy to be proven wrong!
@jrbates81 With all due respect, a lot of the avenues have been cut off due the absorption of a few social media platforms. And I‚Äôve been doing this longer. (No disrespect meant!)
@hijinksensue That‚Äôs INSANE Joel. You‚Äôd think if someone followed you, YOU‚ÄôD RELEVANT TO THEIR INTERESTS.
@D4nnyDeco @phirm I think you may have missed the Instagram algorithm shift a couple weeks ago :)
@breakingdavid My wife has discovered that things she talks about while her phone is nearby magically appear as ads in her Insta feed. Maybe it‚Äôs coincidence? ü§î
@meedeeums No not like you‚Äôd think. There are too many other things jammed in our faces at all times. It‚Äôs difficult to rise above the noise unless you‚Äôre at Beyonc√© level.
@breakingdavid And what do I need to be ‚Äúcareful‚Äù about?
@breakingdavid They‚Äôre not ‚Äúfree‚Äù if you‚Äôre any kind of creator. You have to now pay to reach the audience that is already following you.
@mosseri Let‚Äôs talk offline! Twitter is too tough for conversations. Email: stuff@nerdist.com
@mosseri @AnthonyQuintano Let's talk! I know it's not anyone's goal to destroy small businesses but that's what's happening. And they're being ransomed with "boost" to people who should already be able to see their stuff when they click "follow". Would love to talk/listen/understand.
@ryankindahl @id10t Yup. That's why I changed it.
@themorrancave It doesn't make the argument less true. And I'm not doing those spots anymore. But if you're just looking for holes to poke to distract from this current issue, have at it! I guess that's helpful? Somehow? ;)
@AnthonyQuintano @instagram @facebook @mosseri Always open to polite, constructive conversation! I offered to fly up to their HQ and bring a handful of creators to discuss openly. That offer still stands!
@rjwUS @DevaniAnjali There are unconfirmed rumors that if you are caught in a message pod they will shadow ban you
Last thing...talk about it. Let @facebook &amp; @instagram know how you feel. They're not bad people. They're just people trying to do their job who maybe have lost a bit of touch with the humans who populate their network. So remind them! (politely)
And go where exactly? Most people don't go to websites/blogs anymore. Social media all but eviscerated that. So how do people without money reach their audience now? Since you're so full of ideas. ;) https://t.co/TWua09mdh3
Consequences like this...I hope you're listening @instagram &amp; @facebook https://t.co/4vmmkvXpBi
Sorry I'm just ranting about FB/Insta this morning because it's been eating at me. But it really is a big deal with severe and far-reaching consequences not just for indie creators but for how information itself is shared. Ok I'll shut up now &amp; go back to my dumb wiener jokes.
@SethNiesen No I'm not anymore. But sweet swipe there!
100% understood, but as they collectively have almost half the planet as a userbase, there should be stricter rules for how they do business because of the sheer impact on society every whimsical Zuckerberg decision has. https://t.co/KWPoLK7trf
And btw, if you want to know what a world without net neutrality feels like, where information is priortized not by you but by companies who now can charge you for what you see thanks to the FCC, FB/Insta is the perfect case study in that right now. WE JUST CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS
Most of these tech companies fall prey to the algorithm. They spend so much time mapping human behavior that they forget how to make their platforms ACTUALLY human. I think the algorithm may be coaxing them into an AI apocalypse.
FB/Insta is basically the largest country in the world &amp; has become fascist. "Post how we want you to post or pay us to reach your audience." They also have been advising to "post meaningful things" but then keep their algorithm a closely guarded secret. It shouldn't be allowed.
Besides my own ego w/ having my reach on Instagram cut by 50-75%, there are artists, creators, small businesses whom FB/Insta lured away from blogs/websites who will literally be DESTROYED by this algorithm shift. Not reaching their audience is devastating to them. It's serious.
Anyone else feel like it's pointless to post on Instagram anymore since the algorithm is going to keep most of the people who are following you from seeing it anyway? And even if they do it might be a week later. What are they even doing over there? WHY DO THEY HATE US
@bassfrequencies Ahhhhhhhhh got it. Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss something!

Tonight at 8/7c is the season finale of @NBCTheWall, so if you're a casual viewer or haven't seen it yet, trust me when I say THIS IS THE EPISODE TO WATCH. It's a doozy! I'm bringing that word back. Doozy. #TwentyThreeSkadoo
@ManMadeMoon @gvader Oh this is WAY already gonna happen!
@mikeo119 NICE!
@tubefilter @nerdist So maybe I'll stay! Maybe I won't! I don't know at this point, but I don't have plans in either direction and that sentence is a tad misleading. Thanks! And sorry for the correction!
@tubefilter @nerdist Thanks! But "and he plans to step down from his role as Nerdist CEO once Legendary can onboard a replacement" isn't really true. I had said on the podcast that even though the contract technically expired, I'm going to work with the new Leg CEO to figure out what's next.
@N3L5ON_MD No, it was announced today that Equifax is going to face zero consequences for the massive user data breach on which they sat for months without telling anyone.
@toasterposter @jonahray @MattMira I've been hovering over that and might do it. The next few eps are recorded but I can start layering it in!
@xCrimsonGhostxx Shit I wish I had thought of that yesterday! We redid those. Maybe I can still squeak it in.
Ironically, I'll bet if Equifax ran its 3-in-1 score through Equifax it would have a difficult time buying a car for the next seven years.
@webjournalist Thank you for both of those things! :D
@CheshirePlays Considering they were following me on twitter it's possible they got the name idea from me since they launched around the time we had our ID10T Festival last year. They haven't posted since Nov so they may have wrapped it up. But I actually do own the rights to the name. ;)
@DylanMGraham Hugs, dude!
@RockstarSuicide No reset! Too confusing. I‚Äôll just pick it up where the last count left off.
@RealMysterie Ha! Your knuckles are the tombstones of my past! But seriously those are rad.

@nivrad I was filming on my dash parked. Is that okay? Or does that not meet your policing skills?
@NerdistMom @nerdist Ma, you should use whatever you want to use! I doubt Nerdist would have a problem with that.
@ScottAukerman A fellow would have to be CrAzY to do such a thing!
@jgscoble I personally reached out to them but they never responded. But there's not much to work out! I have the trademark on it and have had it for a while. Theirs launched in May (long after I announced ID10T as a thing with the festival) and they haven't posted since November.
@brewerbaking @LydiaHearst Excited to see it! I‚Äôve been to the house a couple times. I tried to get Helen Mirren on the podcast but wasn‚Äôt able to!
@nachokingp I reached out to them but they never responded! I‚Äôve had the trademark on it for a while. It‚Äôs been a lengthy process!
@kartekth @nerdist We‚Äôll still do cork board!
@RSpiver heh heh. A few years ago I almost went in that direction but worried it would require too much explanation!
@volks_22 @id10t Not particularly! We'll still have them, but just not more than usual.

Good question! No, it won't change at all. I'm sure they'll just bleep. But the radio version will be edited to fit a time format (probably an hour). That said, the regular podcast version will be available unedited and free in exactly the same way as now. https://t.co/Wl6n9tLT9W
@StuXU Nope! You won't have to re-subscribe. Just a name change.
@ballsinplay That's a great point! Thanks!

@ABAOProductions @SlappyJack @DaveYourFave @RedGiantNews @instagram What concerns me is that this idea that posts need to be "meaningful" to go out to everyone they should just go out to anyway (by virtue of the fact that people followed you) is murky. I fear that "meaningful" is actually going to mean "paid".
@eaterofworlds84 BIRTHDAY!
@CMPunk No no a thousand times no!!! (also hugs dude!)
No! And no one is pregnant (that seems to be a common guess so far). https://t.co/BrVp2zdwXz
Very very big Nerdist Podcast announcement tomorrow. Hostful going up in the am. It‚Äôs not ending! Just wanna take that off your emotional table. Big announcement though. Scary! But exciting!
@ShawnCoss @aliciawitty Well the best we can do is stick together as creators and support good content. I'm not sure how we solve this problem right away, but if any of us figure it out we should share that info! I will if I do!
@aliciawitty @ShawnCoss @instagram Yeah it's a mess right now. I hope they sort it out soon!
@ShawnCoss @aliciawitty @instagram I mean why on earth would instagram determine what your followers should see? If you follow someone, YOU WANT TO SEE THEIR STUFF. That's part of the "follow" agreement I thought. Maybe they don't fully understand how people actually use the platform?
@yitbosaz @instagram Same! And same for a lot of people.
@SlappyJack @DaveYourFave @instagram It‚Äôs 2018! People don‚Äôt go to websites that way anymore. It‚Äôs be nice if they did but they don‚Äôt. Social media usurped all of that!
@ShawnCoss @instagram Worse, it's going to even further turn social engagement into capiltalism, which is what contributed to FB &amp; YouTube's creative decline. It rewards the most EXTREME behavior, top-levels it, and that's where obnoxious assholes step in &amp; post loud attention-seeking garbage.
@ShawnCoss @instagram I've seen a sudden drop of 50-75% in engagement which would be fine if it were just my ego being bruised, but it's going to hobble things that I KNOW the audience following me would want to know about and stuff indie creators NEED them to know about. Such a bummer.
@mistimichellexo @instagram I mean what's the point of following someone if Instagram is deciding whether or not you should see their posts?? This kind of algorithm crap ruined youtube for creators.
@ShawnCoss @instagram A lot of times these tech companies scale and forget how important supporting the early adopters who helped attract users is. But they have like a billion users so it's not like they're really going to care if a handful of us start backing away from it. Sucks though.
@DaveYourFave @instagram Well the bummer part is that there's not really any place else to go.
@ShawnCoss @instagram That's what I have been afraid was happening. Super disappointing. They're obviously allowed to run their service however they want, but ransoming engagement all of a sudden is mafia-style tactics.
@DaveYourFave @instagram Engagement is down A LOT. Somewhere between 50-75%. I've noticed it not just on my feed but other folks as well. Yeah I think they're going to start ransoming engagement which is crappy for folks who rely on it to reach their audiences for work stuff.
Something‚Äôs up with @Instagram. It‚Äôs been weird the last couple weeks. It‚Äôs either glitching or they changed the algorithm. Anyone noticing anything off about it besides me? It could be just me.
@LydiaHearst @Susan__Jennifer @75hshovel @CNN Also, the scumbag who wrote the book and produced the doc used one of her mom‚Äôs KIDNAPPERS as his main source. It‚Äôs really disrespectful and heartbreaking.
BLOOD MOON!!!!!! Ah shit now I gotta kill those Bokoblins and Lizalfos AGAIN. brb
@BigKevP79 @midnight SCREW THAT NOISE
@BigKevP79 @midnight I honestly don't know! That's a comedy central thing but I haven't heard that it's possible. Sorry about that! Actually I didn't even know eps were available at all.
Black Panther was so FANTASTIC. Honestly the excitement I felt in Hall H last year was only elevated by seeing the whole film. The cheers in the theater throughout the movie were electric. Particularly, seeing @DanaiGurira on the big screen CRUSHING IT was my favorite. See it!!!
@JaredSchnabl @NBCTheWall Clancy Brown! He's a legend and great in everything.
hugs are the damn best! https://t.co/oYkE9qProU
Second to last episode this season of @NBCTheWall!! Tonight at 8/7c! This episode is amazing...HIGH FIVES! https://t.co/ah6KpNQcDe
@JuleighNguyen @ID10Tfest Yup! November at Orange County Fairgrounds!
@RevTerryRice Can't find them in the tree! But I'm sure they're in there somewhere.
@RevTerryRice What are their first names? I‚Äôll see if I have them on the https://t.co/cEgAvykSyC tree.
@gavviefarron @MarinaSRenee "Every day's a school day" should be on a shirt! Love it.
@gavviefarron I send back the same GIF to you! When Chandler first started on the show, he said his perfect zombie weapon would be a flamethrower with a bayonet. How do you feel about your snarky tweet now? ;)
@chandlerriggs Well you know you have to attach a bayonet to it
@JacksonDahl1 November!
@ctdocken @nerdist Welcome back!
@sign_for_panini Much appreciated! But we‚Äôre all set!
@andrew_coulomb @Variety Well it may never come out! Who knows? We submitted the pilot script to the network yesterday and soon they decide if we shoot it! Even if we do that they still have to decide if they pick it up, so we're a ways away. But fingers crossed! And thanks!
@andrew_coulomb @Variety Tonally it's really kind of like Newsradio or Night Court but in a museum, if that helps. I mean, if everyone is perfect it's not really a comedy! But no one is an idiot in the script we just turned in if that also helps!
@andrew_coulomb @Variety Considering you know nothing else about it, aren't you worried that forming a theory with any real data is not the way science is done ;)
@sign_for_panini Nope! Just us
My friend @toddglass has a new comedy special! I mean, yeah, Todd could play a little more music on his podcast, but he's super funny so please watch his special. https://t.co/M3abuhz1Jn
April, I believe! Comedy Works downtown. https://t.co/gkzpmXJFQz
This was so much fun. That Vince Gilligan is a wonderful genius. https://t.co/YFtPB6mAej
Yes please come to this! https://t.co/TBOiksoTc2
@LaurenEvansTV @nerdist That is an excellent point!
@DieselOnRadio @midnight I mean I know it's strange but...that IS kind of what I want for the galaxy. That and free Fun Dip‚Ñ¢. https://t.co/6GAxySXsY6
@DieselOnRadio @midnight nah mah prah brah
Holy shitpants CONGRATULATIONS to @JordanPeele, @emilyvgordon, &amp; @kumailn on their FUCKING OSCAR NOMS. Such good/talented/inspiring people who deserve all the success in the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è
CAN CONFIRM https://t.co/nJGrLXdciI
TONIGHT balls will DROP. @NBCTheWall is back with a new ep at 8/7c. I'm sorry this tweet reads like a promo. But it is! Ultimately, please watch the show so we can make more. Ok I love you.
@tweedandtales This is cool! The house is English Manor with Arts &amp; Crafts undertones so Victorian might clash a tad. Which is ironic since I love Victorian! Thank you!
@tweedandtales Still haven‚Äôt found one!
@JohnLegere @stephengillett @overwatchleague @SHAQ @ConanOBrien @RyanSeacrest @terrycrews I‚Äôm mean do we HAVE to use the word ‚Äúsenior‚Äù? How about ‚Äúworldly‚Äù? Although I must admit that calling it ‚ÄúOverhill‚Äù is pretty funny.
@ZenMonkeyStudio @ID10Tfest @MST3K @RickandMorty Announcements soon! But email me and I‚Äôll connect you with the gang. We‚Äôre doing it in November in Orange County this year.
@iaincarrie Ha! Yeah they made it for France!
Hey Phoenix! I'm coming to @standuplive Feb 8-10! Come to that! Tix herrrrre -&gt; https://t.co/lOXR0c6QFn
@SpencerParks @ABFalecbaldwin @matchgame Considering he blocked me on twitter for some reason, I doubt they'll ask!
@Malailama @nerdist Going up today!
@hockeysteph Oh actually I'm not doing the work myself. There's a professionally licensed team in place! And the house had been updated some in the early 2000s. I'm undoing a lot of that and putting it back in the period in which it was built. This isn't the first time I've done this! :)
I loved the first episode of #BlackLightning! @CressWilliams was also a wonderful podcast guest. I'll post it next week! And seriously you should watch the show.
@ssshortzzz @JerrySeinfeld @nerdist @cicgcshow I would do it as long as I can get decaf. Regular coffee gives me the shakes! True story.
@gingerninja2008 I know right??? It sneaks up on ya and BOOM. Waterworks.
@FonicOddity @bluntpants @NBCTheWall Ok ok! We‚Äôll get confetti back next season!! üéâ
@Deanna_APR @NBCTheWall Hahaha I‚Äôm not allowed to tell her where to play!!!
@Navygirl_13 Congratulations!!!
@BULLDOGFUNK ha where did that come from??
@AdamLeong5150 Depends on the joke! You keep tweaking until it works! Sometimes zero, once, or dozens. You just never know.
@chapeaurider @WaltDisneyWorld I can only tell you about Disneyland, which is in CA
@hankgreen I'm just trying to fit in with the kids and all of their crazy newel posts   (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)
Hey architecture nerds...any sites you like that might have antique wood carvings that would be placed atop a newel post? I've seen some old houses that have these as ceramic figures or statuettes as well. #CrazySaturdayNight
Hurray! Someone‚Äôs trying to access my twitter account again! Knock it off, wieners...
@CorgiKohmander @CSSully @YokoMcCann @camerondeuel @HilaryLGray @OriginalFunko It has to be Funkon! With a K! Also makes it sound like an evil robot‚Äôs name. #Funkon
@sdamadeo @AMC_TV Feb 25
@ErikDavis @THATJacqueline @emilyvgordon Ha! The weirdest picture of me ever captured. This was the ‚ÄúAHA! No one ate their tiny dinner sandwiches!!!‚Äù moment. Lovely to see you all! Hope you had fun!
@raynordavid Ken's Artisan Bakery!
@taradublinrocks @wwwbigbaldhead @JDMorgan @chandlerriggs @steveyeun @Cudlitz @MothersBistro @LydiaHearst Agreed on this! Yall should definitely check out @MothersBistro! Best breakfast/brunch food in Portland!
@GoneWithTheSin We‚Äôre making some other very similar ones for sdcc!
@DIYBailey Holy cats 4 years!!! Congratulations! That is wonderful! Nicely done!
@adamwgodfrey @funko Thanks Adam! Having been on the other side of that situation more than once I just wanted to make sure everyone felt supported!
@jpittwriter Excellent! Make that thing!
@LOTDPodcast Can I do the same but with tweets like this? ;)
Watch me unbox me https://t.co/Ovj0Umpn6b
Boy @instagram sure wants you to turn notifications on! They want it more than life itself. This overly friendly reminder is there every. Damn. Time. I will never turn them on! NEVARRRRRRRRRRR https://t.co/Wb0VW7hFv5
@Chainsaw4Real @heathercampbell @KenW420 Oh did we already tell you about it?
@heathercampbell @KenW420 "Knifey Stabbinfeld's Bloodsplosion Taxi"
Thank you to @camerondeuel &amp; @CSSully for an amazing tour of the @OriginalFunko offices yesterday! There's a whole mess o' fun pics on my instagram account but here's my favorite: https://t.co/H0GcW8wv5Z
1) Slip and hit your head while hanging a clock 2) have vision for Flux Capacitor 3) Put FC in DeLorean 4) trade pinball parts for plutonium 5) invite dopey teenager to mall parking lot in the middle of the night 6) set time circuits 7) get in car and drive 88mph https://t.co/DaskYOxaKk
@RevTerryRice oh probably so! I think all of the hardwicks are related, so hello, cousin!
@RevTerryRice already saw it!
@UncleJJ78 I'm disappointed in myself for NOT hearing that when I said it
@A_plUSAnd_mINUS haha THANK YOU ;)
@blerdwords In that case HAPPY DAY OF YOUR BIRTH, SIR!
Is it weird that https://t.co/WSMGOzKgUC is a regular sponsor of Investigation Discovery when 80% of the channel are couples who murder each other?
@ManMadeMoon @garywhitta It could be tricky...I imagine this ballroom is just full of squeaky balls and might, therefore, be too distracting for the sheepdog to dance properly. But it's worth a shot! Is it ok if I rename it "The Foxtrot and the Hound"??
@samanthalauzon @NBCTheWall Thank you! I love doing it!
Pogo-citement! https://t.co/4bzzT3NJZa
@crashontheway Hell yeah it is! That's a big one!! Give yourself the proper credit for that!
@phantomliger89 @feliciaday @LydiaHearst I'll take a swing at it heyoooooooooooooo
Oh btw, if you're watching @NBCTheWall tonight we're having a contest to guess how many times I utter the word "balls". You read correctly. Try it! Guesses must be submitted via Instagram/Twitter/FB using this hashtag: #TheWallBallsContest https://t.co/s9Xv3UJ2gn
Ok @LydiaHearst has been deep into Skyrim on Switch and trying to pull me back in. I gave 18 months to that game on Xbox! At the end I was just running around putting produce in my various houses. I dunno...Digging Splatoon 2 but the Dovahkiin might be shouting my name...
@CherryBombToys I'm sorry we left today! Otherwise I would have dropped by for sure! Thank you for the invite! Happy New Year
@lamanocomic @ID10Tfest There will be! It's moving to Southern California this year if that affects anything for you.
New episodes of The Wall start tonight! https://t.co/7sAPohNa2w
@mattiseman I'm glad we all recovered from our red nose day falls! Happy 2018, Matt!
@SteveMayne2 @itsdickenstime @kumailn @elonmusk I'd happy to do that. Or Elon and I could bowl for supremacy.
@PlourdeRenny Nope. Just not eating it most of the time.
@OKTetsujin Niiiiiice! Thank you!
We managed to get in to @ApizzaScholls tonight and it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. SOOOO GOOOOOOOD. Dammit. So good. #pdx https://t.co/XHOgJvtSw4
@pokpokpdx It was FANTASTIC. So so good. Thank you!
@sideshowsuzy Eh...no one is intentionally ignoring you...they have to sift through literally THOUSANDS of tweets. They can't possibly see and respond to every one. That said, thank you and happy Xmas!
@DanRobertsJr Thank you, Dan! Happy holidays!
Last question in freefall on @NBCTheWall a nice shoutout to the 901. HEY MEMPHIS HOW YOU BEEN
The @NBCTheWall is about to start on the west coast! Watch it now!
@1princemalcolm @NBCTheWall Hugs and happy holidays!!! :)
@chi4_energy @MothersBistro Been there! Really great.
Holy cats @MothersBistro has AMAZING biscuits &amp; gravy. I love this place! #pdx
@pasteljeffrey I'm gonna!
Hey there's a @NBCTheWall episode on tonight! I remember the episode well and the two guys who are on are the sweetest humans. Highly recommended viewing at 8/7c!
@RonFunches @pokpokpdx OK we'll hop in an Uber now and should be there Friday at 3am
@gcliles Nice work! Fwiw, I've never regretted my decision. Stay strong!!
@PRG919 They have the golden arcs!
Coming to America on VH1 right now is yet another gift this holiday season. #McDowells
@pokpokpdx Done! Thanks!
@pokpokpdx Ok we'll try again tomorrow! What's the number for reservations?
@stevenclucas @pokpokpdx Oh I've been to PSB. That place is magic.
@pokpokpdx Where is that one? The one on Division said no reservations for parties under 6! We're only 2. It's too dang cold to wait outside! We're climate-fragile Los Angelenos. ;)
@HigginsFOS @pokpokpdx @GroundKontrol ooooooooo GK expanded?? Ok we will definitely check that out. Thanks!!
Passing through Portland for a couple days. Was told to hit @pokpokpdx but they had 90 min wait at 5:40p so we skipped that noise! Where else is good?
@KyleClutch1 well okay. happy birthday a couple days late!
@PaulTheDesigner @LydiaHearst üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
@csmartinek I'll make sure you get one! It may take a bit for the email to get to you but don't worry! Thanks and happy holidays! :)
@csmartinek What email did you use? I'll see if I can have them locate it! But I think they're all out for the holiday.
@csmartinek Yes it went out yesterday!
@lhagan3 Phew! Thank you! Have a great holiday!
@tfanch08 @nerdist yes!
@MrsLegendary117 Sweet! Merry Xmas to you too!!!
@MrsLegendary117 Yup!
@KMarcusk73 Emails going out any second!
@elizaskinner @jonahray I think I got it from @captainsvintage! It's older than most of the people who yell at me on social media.
@whitneyweaver @jonahray @DrawFour @berkebreathed @bloomcounty I got it on a vintage site
I love this @jonahray fella as if he was my own giant brother. Thanks for knittin' a great sweater @DrawFour! (also shout out to @berkebreathed w/ the vintage @bloomcounty tee) https://t.co/h4giHEJBwu
@DixonBrother_ @wholelottacrzy @NerdistMom @OriginalFunko @tjwoolno @BEAZTmodeNY @reneenee652003 @kingfrosti1996 @planetpakua @JDMorgan @AMCTalkingDead @lmmtwd @ilove4paws @twdmemequeen Email going out today!
Points, @AndrewHusband! And thank you!!! I miss that dang show every day. #RIPAtMidnight https://t.co/3SXg1RzNiv
@_Legend_Has_It Thank YOU!
You were in line behind Popeye?? He‚Äôs WAY into both of those. Did he additionally ask for yams? Because he yam what he yam. Also it must have been weird to watch him turn on the heater and subsequently burn off his wiener. Don‚Äôt blame him! He lives in a garbage can. #TootToot https://t.co/ljEjYnMcah
@KenPlume @Disneyland Screw the tea cups. I wouldn‚Äôt last 3 seconds. You just win that one.
@RedRedRobyn You too! If you remember around what the date was I can dig through the photo app!
@Eryn_NotErin @midnight Sure! 25 Points!!!
@3rdshiftweirdo I get a lot of stuff from @vegalleries!
@ckylee3 @drkHMRpally @HHNguy365 @AMCTalkingDead @OriginalFunko Send a pic with them if you feel like it! I'm going to post some of them!
@HHNguy365 @AMCTalkingDead @OriginalFunko So glad you got one o' those!!! Happy Holidays!
@sassenachMona Hurray!!!! So glad you got him! And thank you!
@AndreyAtuchin I can't unless you follow me or maybe shoot me an email at stuff@nerdist.com. Thanks!
@OsteoF Thank you and my apologies!! (there might be some better news on that front this week) :D
@Frauenfelder amazing Trezor story! just read it. what did you do with all that stressy brainspace freed up??
@AndreyAtuchin hi! how can I contact you about a commission?
@iRobot charging error 6 right outta the box, eh? :/ https://t.co/oefYef52Ed
@ThatKidHines In any case thanks for wanting one in the first place and I hope you have wonderful holidays!
@ThatKidHines It took 4 days for the email to go out (not a week) because I was trying to see if a new order could be filled and didn‚Äôt want to email everyone without knowing what was happening. We should have news from the manufacturer (whom I don‚Äôt control) next week. :)
@ThatKidHines It took 90 minutes because it happened between 5am and 6:30am. It is 100% the truth. You are free to not like that truth, but the truth it is. Mistakes do happen, but I understand why you‚Äôre angry and I‚Äôm really sorry!
@ImTooBoring @OriginalFunko nice collection! Happy Xmas to you too!
@DoomJX Thank you!! Happy holidays!
@DoomJX @KMarcusk73 Yes, it SHOULD have been. But since this was my first time doing this, I had zero idea that scalpers would do that. Didn't even cross my mind once. Didn't even know anyone would want one of these! But in the future, we will limit per customer for sure.
Congratulations to @punyent &amp; @shadipetosky for making the @latimes best of 2017 TV w/ @dangerandeggs!!! https://t.co/qbKSqek62Z
@DoomJX @kuhnzombie I'm so sorry! It's a sucky situation but I promise I'll do what I can to fix it! Also, THANK YOU FOR WANTING ONE!!! :)
@marjarrpresents @OriginalFunko Hugs!!! Thank you! :)
@GrrNoise @midnight Thank you so much!!! I feel terrible about it but I think we'll have a decent solution soon!
@Zammwow I'm so sorry about that news! But how was your ride photo???
I love you @rianjohnson. I thought Last Jedi was INCREDIBLE. I *may* have had leaky eyes a few times during it. Thank you for making a wonderful @starwars film!!!
@StyggeUlven @nerdist looping in @RachelHeine who can check to see if there's a problem on the backend of the page!
@DoomJX As far as I know, they did ship this week!
Hey Georgie! Today's @nerdist podcast Bill Skarsg√•rd! üéà https://t.co/yLgImHUmIn
@samgilbey @nerdist So good!!!
This is tonight! In LA! For charity!! https://t.co/skMYZ4D0u9
@grossjason @nbc Yeah I need to write off that cave bear skeleton somehow!!!
Hey here‚Äôs a sitcom thing I‚Äôve been developing for @nbc! It is such a crazy honor to be writing with David X Cohen. I am a Futurama fan of the highest order! https://t.co/v2oagzXZLT
@erikkain @darinbunch @PaulTassi Tell you what! Feel free to shoot me an email: stuff@nerdist.com! Twitter is rough for conversations. I think all opinions are valid! But at some point you have to decide if something is causing you more grief than reward. And that is a very reasonable question to ask and answer.
@erikkain @darinbunch @PaulTassi I respect your right to hate the show now, but I'm a problem/solution person. What good does going on and on about it do? I'm totally open to listening to any alternative solutions you might have. Really, I am on your side. I'm just not sure what you want me to do about it.
@erikkain @darinbunch @PaulTassi But people now hate that idea because, as consumers, we're getting kind of entitled about stuff. "I'M MAD MAKE ME HAPPY." But it is literally impossible to make every single person happy. We're becoming conditioned to think everything has to suit us 100% or it's our enemy.
@erikkain @darinbunch @PaulTassi And what answer would satisfy you? If I grow to hate something, then YEAH. I stop watching. If something is so upsetting to me that I complain about it non-stop to the point where I'm tagging people who can do NOTHING about it. Yeah. I would stop.
@cox_jim different sizes and species. and truthfully I'm not 100% sure they were all actually squids, but in my dream there were.
@ChrisWarcraft And that would be the FINEST greenscreen CG Nautilus work the world has ever seen...
Last night I dreamt I was at a screening of a re-imagining of "Jaws" that starts with a giant Nautilus jumping out of the water to eat a fisherman's face. Then a helicopter kept dumping various squids in the water. There were zero sharks. Just needed to tell someone.
@darinbunch @erikkain @PaulTassi How about the "enough" gif for people who don't have to watch but do anyway JUST so they can complain about something? Is that something you learned how to do in that 50 years, Darin? ;)
You rule, @elizaskinner! https://t.co/GDCq1aQc6r
@elizaskinner @JKCorden You are brilliant and this was a FANTASTIC thing! Thanks, Eliza!
@teespring Hi! Please stop selling my ‚Äúdead live‚Äù shirt. We had to obtain a license for that! And we paid the artist for the design. It also compromises the quality and special nature it for the consumers. Your bootlegging it is uncool for everyone. Come on now. :)
@beensentoe Now that is a good idea. @wilw would approve!
@Blakely_Nate13 @NerdistMom @LydiaHearst Yes!!! She's the best.
@snozberries44 @1iota @AMCTalkingDead I'm not there yet but have requested assistance for you!
@snozberries44 @1iota @AMCTalkingDead @WalkingDead_AMC I'm sure if I asked @1iota nicely they'll help out for your birthday!
@NateD0gg115 @JackieBlood The important thing is, those people people really get to feel like accomplished something today. ;)
@anndroo @AMCTalkingDead Ok let‚Äôs just all drop everything we‚Äôre doing and change things for your specific vernacular then
@LamonteBall Seems like it‚Äôs winning just fine by all empirical data ;)
@JackieBlood Well this has been fun
Mid-season finale of @AMCTalkingDead TONIGHT! Join us!
@0bm @HeliumComedyPdx I don‚Äôt say it everyday anymore so I forget!
@krisco47 Where is that? What‚Äôs it called?
@mikevardy How's the weather this time of year? And is Orcas Island worth visiting for a day or two?
@LydiaHearst @throxian Don't waste 1a and 0s on this clueless dipshit, Lyds
We talked to Tarantino almost exactly TWO YEARS AGO on the @nerdist podcast about doing a Star Trek movie but somehow NOW it's "exclusive" news. üôÑ https://t.co/ZkN0s7EMcT
Thinking about going to Victoria, BC at some point. What are your favorite hotels there? And what‚Äôs good to see while there?
@OdioMagazine @nerdist @LtJoeKenda Next time!!
@chrisfairbanks Amazing!
@chrisfairbanks Whaaaaaaa!!! Josh never told me that! He might not have known that we know each other!
@heathercampbell @Atencio @DrewFromTV @sethmeyers @allanhaldeman @hendbaghdady HAC, it is a legitimate honor to work with you!!!
@emilyvgordon @NerdMelt Also, the wonderful community Nerdmelt Showroom became would never have existed without you!!! You were VERY LARGELY responsible for that happening. Words cannot properly express how grateful I am for you! Thank you x a million! :)
@emilyvgordon @NerdMelt It was because you're a DANG GENIUS. And besides being capable to the extent that I'm sure it can be annoying how much people drop responsibility on you, you're also mind-blowingly insightful and incredibly compassionate. Your success is so deserved! THE WORLD NEEDS MORE EMILYS.
@amelialynn727 @evernote Thank you! I just use iCal!
Hey look at me! I'm a sellout! (insert "you're tellin' me!" jokes) #PDX https://t.co/GYxWC1kZvN
@NosmoRex @HeliumComedyPdx @phirm Thanks John!! I‚Äôm glad we worked out our differences! ;)
@seanallen14 @AMCTalkingDead I actually own that very piece that was on the set, but it's the only one. Our show made it just for the set and it was never produced anywhere commercially. I'm sorry! Best of luck with the wedding!
@SierraDeeTv_ @TheWalkingDead Oh no! Please don't take that personally! You are not being ignored! Please just understand that with so many people sending messages on social media, things can sadly get lost in the shuffle. Apologies! And thank you for being a wonderful fan and reaction-maker! :)
The @nerdist podcast has the return of @LtJoeKenda! That man is riveting! Take a listen however you smoosh podcasts in your ears. #MyMyMy
@HeyDanKurtz @HeliumComedyPdx @phirm @flypdx points
@phantomliger89 @punyent Amazon
Woooooooooooooo!! We‚Äôre nominated alongside Archer, Bob‚Äôs Burgers, Bojack, Rick &amp; Morty, and The Simpsons so this is already an insane honor. Nice work @punyent!! https://t.co/vflrQbN5Yf
If you're in Portland, Oregon this weekend I'll get slinging jokes at @HeliumComedyPdx tomorrow through Saturday w/ my buddy @phirm! Grab those tix here-&gt; https://t.co/yZwrNy55uc Also RIP classic @flypdx carpet. https://t.co/LRV6lLC5tS
@wendysimp88 Who said it? It wasn‚Äôt me so I have no idea.
@Ricky_Genius If he does it will be just as much a surprise to me!
@R0ckyR0c0c0 Welcome to last year‚Äôs news. Also welcome to 100 year old news: https://t.co/Vnq1DmVBlE so what do you do with your time when you‚Äôre not finding out about stuff other people know?? ;)
@Ricky_Genius I have no idea what‚Äôs coming up and I did not get the sense that that was case. They‚Äôre very extra careful about guarding beans so we wouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to address it that way. So even though it‚Äôs fun to call out a ‚Äúmajor slip up‚Äù I don‚Äôt think that was the case.
@kevinoftl @TheWalkingDead @AMCTalkingDead I have wondered that as well
We made this shirt to celebrate the time Eugene "chomped on Dwight's chode" as he put it. I give you, THE NUTCRACKER (just in time for the holidays). It's available at https://t.co/qD84fEgMZd! https://t.co/MANw0Ebcqv
@tiptoptrev My guess is that you get the show on a different network in the UK so they're blurring out the AMC network bug in the corner. Cheers!

@ColtonSJAtkins I think it could represent that he's the angel on the inside who has the heart of an Alexandrian...
Come out to my shows this weekend! And I'll be paying you a visit, @BlueStarDonuts....#PDX https://t.co/Yrb4KAuZaz
@lizzygrujin @charltonbrooker @nerdist I would be 100% in favor of that occurrence.
@NerdistMom Ahhhhh good to know!
@HRottieMom My dad is from there! Mobile, I believe.
@SerAphMonkey  https://t.co/OI9xpsHT3w
@GlassSpiider What do you think the joke is? I‚Äôm curious...
@Nerdy_Angel I love Murfreesboro. I'm performed at Middle Tennesse State and I used to play in chess tournaments in that city when I was in grade school. Nice Woodbury tie in too!
@EnviroguyTy Thank you for all of that!
@Nerdy_Angel Ooooooh where? I'm from Memphis! Nephew lives in Maryville.
@HillJewell @renesperez Arkansas is a beautiful state! I'm from Memphis and lived in Jonesboro for a time.
Wow that Alabama Senate race is really redneck and neck
@p2peters If I can make it happen, I WILL! Great idea, Paul!
@tara_hale @kharypayton @smugorange @mcbridemelissa @WalkrStalkrCon @wwwbigbaldhead @YNB @JDMorgan @Illustratorsaus @DirIllustration @StevenOgg @chandlerriggs @austin_amelio So stunning Tara!!! Really beautiful work. THE KING WOULD BE PROUD
It just happened! @LtJoeKenda posts Tuesday!!! https://t.co/YQ1yDAPqZd
@Levtron12 @punyent Haha possibly but @shadipetosky can fix!
@ElizabethKGreen @GroovyBruce NUT LOGS!!! Those things always made me sick after one bite and I bought them every time anyway.
@travis_corzine @thekevinryder @kevinandbean @AndrewSiciliano They have no say. When a parent company comes in starts dictating rules and budgets, that‚Äôs beyond their control. Can you tell your boss how to spend money and what to do or not do? It‚Äôs a bad situation for everyone I think.
Hey here‚Äôs @punyent‚Äôs new show for @Netflix! As a reminder, this is my animation studio w/ the wonderful @shadipetosky. This @juliavickerman show will be fantastic and wonderful and I‚Äôm proud to be a part of it! https://t.co/YXF7hgnrnb
@travis_corzine Furthermore, refusing to come to work SERIOUSLY fucks the people under them who work on the show but have no power. So maybe they are also making sure THOSE employees are taken care of. Love how easy it is for people with no experience in a situation to call the shots on it. :/
@travis_corzine @thekevinryder @kevinandbean @AndrewSiciliano What do you expect them to do? Everyone else was barely not fired from what I hear, so threatening to not come to work 1) wouldn't do anything and 2) could get everyone sued by their company. What you should support is actual fact-finding instead of armchair criticism.
@ballsinplay for the podcast? No didn't get anyone from the movie. I'm missing the premiere sadly because I'll be performing out of town.
@rachelcw @midnight I DO I DO
@SIENNA1599 Wonderful! Thank you!
@CarolBlymire @Apple @AppleSupport Oh yeah always!
@KmikeFonagy @Apple @AppleSupport it's on 2 different units in the house.
Anyone else having an issue with @apple TV where all of your purchases are just gone? @AppleSupport any ideas? https://t.co/IBxUIcgy0j
@TomacKostolomac ...all watch how it all plays out and THEN decide how we feel about it? You came after me with assumptions and reading into things without any actual info. You‚Äôre clearly a nice fellow but please fight the urge to put emotion over empiricism. Ok, I hope you have a good night. :)
@TomacKostolomac Your #2 point is the huge assumption that is fueling your dissatisfaction. Just because you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt see it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt happen. I really sincerely don‚Äôt know but this opinion-as-fact thing the Internet is so notorious for is silly. What if‚Äîand this is crazy‚Äîwe just...
@DaveYourFave purchased!
@TomacKostolomac "Us guys"? I have no idea what's coming up on WD. And I didn't know what Lennie was going to say. So no. And what does that spoil exactly anyway? He's moving shows! What's the big thing you think you know that has ruined the whole series for you??
@feliciaday @LydiaHearst Well I did just buy this https://t.co/OeXOBzesNr
@TomacKostolomac @ScottMGimple HIDE WHAT????? I guess people just want to be upset even if it requires assumptions to stay so.
@TomacKostolomac @AMCTalkingDead WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NOT ONE THING HAS BEEN SPOILED. Jesus.
@whitneyavalon I‚Äôve never in my life said ‚Äúnitch‚Äù so there was never a conscious effort to sound like anything :)
@alejandrasoto_ But I guess you've explained that none of that was your intention so no worries! Thanks for the clarification and have a great night! :)
@alejandrasoto_ Well..."Too bad (equals "shame on") @hardwick ignored her (willfully ignoring someone is (a) rude, and (b) shutting them down) attempts at a good discussion (as opposed to the not good one we had?)." It's kind of hard to read this as any other way than antagonistic. (1/2)
@alejandrasoto_ @LisaEdelstein I moved on quickly because we are a live tv show that can't miss time to go to commercial breaks. I get 6ish minutes per segment and there is A LOT of material to cover. Your tweet to your followers suggested that I rudely shut her down, which I DID NOT. :)
@FlemilyEming @ABakerN7 @masterclass I thought I was until I did an event with Oprah recently. She blew me away. Levels of mastery I never even knew existed!
@kurralynn @chadwsz you nailed it! was it easier for you two??
@David_Brody @TheWalkingDead @FearTWD @TheTalkingJamie @Walkers_Talkers @iHeartRadio @iTunes Ahhh I see where you're coming from! But who even knows if they'll stay in the current Fear timeline. Abe might already be dead when they come back. Or if he isn't, who's to say they wouldn't still run into him? You never know with this show.
@brentartist @nerdist @LydiaHearst @kt_money Nice one! You banged that out pretty fast too!
@YNB üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üéÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è
@Joshua_Mikel @kevinsmith @AMCTalkingDead @WalkingDead_AMC It‚Äôs always the nicest people who play the meanest characters. Also you and Jesus need to have a hair battle!!!
@David_Brody @TheWalkingDead @FearTWD @TheTalkingJamie @Walkers_Talkers @iHeartRadio @iTunes Also, HUGS TO YOU AND EVERYONE ON THE SHOW!! I wish I could come back and break down some theories with you!
@David_Brody @TheWalkingDead @FearTWD @TheTalkingJamie @Walkers_Talkers @iHeartRadio @iTunes Haha how can it make no sense if you have literally no information about how it plays out?? What if‚Äîand I know this is crazy‚Äîyou waited to see what the story was and THEN judged how much sense it made? Lol the internet is so funny sometimes. But I do appreciate your passion! :D
Tonight on @AMCTalkingDead the @WalkingDead_AMC x @FearTWD crossover character will be announced and live on the show!! See you in a bit!!
@geekswhodrink Ha! Yes. Kay's husband Michael was my guitar teacher for a while.
@BennettLitwin @midnight I miss it too! Thanks Bennett!
@JRRDunlop Hey Josh! What if I wanted to commission something?? Are you open to that??
@Eric_of_Aragon Have a good night man! :)
@geekswhodrink @Burnside_Fan @SandraCJ1979 @ZacharyLevi @NathanFillion Well those are nice options! Ok then.
@Burnside_Fan @geekswhodrink @SandraCJ1979 @ZacharyLevi @NathanFillion But you do have to hang out in pubs, which I hate :)
@Eric_of_Aragon Truthfully, the way people treat each other online exhausts me. So entitled, rude, vitriolic and yet most people don't even know or have many of the facts they act like they're experts on. There's no more conversation. Just performance-based shouting. Bums me out.
@Eric_of_Aragon No we're processing it all. As a human, you really don't have recurring themes in your conversations with different people during certain time periods? I don't record these every day either. I don't remember what gets talked about when.
@geekswhodrink @SandraCJ1979 @ZacharyLevi @NathanFillion I don't drink. :)
@Eric_of_Aragon PS - it's a real problem whose long term effects are going to be far reaching, I believe. The de-humanizing and de-personalization. For instance, you probably wouldn't have asked me that in person.
@Eric_of_Aragon Serious answer - when you get shit on every day on it and everyone who comes on gets shit on every day on it it's kind of front of mind. So no. If you don't like it there are plenty of other shows that might make you happier.
@deadmau5 New prehistoric skeleton challenge...TITANOBOA https://t.co/7S7p2ZFL6N https://t.co/dcx1lTeXF9
@Livi_bites97 I accept your belated birthday wishes! Thanks!! :)
@dwagner4341 @WalkingDead_AMC @FearTWD @AMCTalkingDead Well you sure told me!! I‚Äôll bet you feel so much better now.
I know who it is! I know who it is!!! But I won't tell you until Sunday.... @WalkingDead_AMC @FearTWD @AMCTalkingDead https://t.co/CUd0I8V8uT
@GunnerGale Thank you thank you!! What a lovely birthday message. I hope your Thanksgiving was wonderful!
@Beards2589 Fanks!
@ErikaElyLewis @LydiaHearst Thank you, Erika!
@CarolBlymire thank you, Carol!!! that's awesome!!!
Hey it's @MST3K Turkey Day Marathon on @Twitch!!! How do they eat? How do they breathe? And other science facts??? I should really just relax. https://t.co/6j53us293g
@ChrisWarcraft Thank youuuuu! Happy Thanksgiving ü¶É
@DuvalMagic Hopefully next year we‚Äôll get 560!!! Happy Brosgiving Bro Bro Bro...Love, Vaughn
@TiffanysTweets Thanks Tiffany!! Happy Thanksgiving!!
@nickscom01 :)
IT'S MAH DAMN BERFDAY! People ask me what they can get me. I don't need "things"! I NEED people being nicer. Donate money or time to charity. Call someone &amp; tell them you care. Hug a friend. Have conversations instead of shout matches online. Kindness is my preferred present!! :)
@NatluvsMJ Or we can call it the 10,000th time I've had this conversation. ;) Happy Thanksgiving to you too!
@NatluvsMJ https://t.co/Vnq1DmVBlE
@DondeGroovily This tweet is counts as something! :)
@PattyMarvel Thanks Patty! Happy T Day!
@FamousBirthdays Thanks!
@NatluvsMJ It‚Äôs actually called pachinko, a very old and popular Japanese casino game. :)  #TheMoreYouKnow
@SpringHillEnt Not yet! Someday...
@sethteel @NBCTheWall @midnight Thank you and fuck you.
@ElizabethKGreen That's so nice!!! Happy T Day to both of you.
@MichaelBates72 It's so dumb. WD is rated TV-MA and we're TV-14. Who can watch gore and then be offended by an f-bomb??? Oh fuckin well! (my feed is rated TV-Fuck It)
@insanetty @latelateshow Noooooooo! That's one of my faves. You just have to pull yourself forward off of the backrest at the right times.
@LydiaHearst I‚Äôm all for it! We‚Äôre just currently out of space!
@HenleyFrey71 @HighHeatStats @sportcardbacks Are you suggesting that we don‚Äôt need no education?
@HenleyFrey71 @HighHeatStats @sportcardbacks Oh my you‚Äôd better go to work for the dictionary stat to correct them then!!! https://t.co/uqlXoiJznS
@HenleyFrey71 @HighHeatStats @sportcardbacks No but thanks for the super clever double imagery!
@HighHeatStats @HenleyFrey71 @sportcardbacks Well...something being ‚Äúparadoxical, unexpected, or coincidental‚Äù leaves a wide berth of interpretation. But I thank you for your other kind words!!
@ladyenigma @thankman360 @NBCTheWall @nbc @LydiaHearst What we don't 'need' are snarky people making assumptions that others are somehow less human and spreading unnecessary negativity. ;) I understood what you meant, Crys! Thanks and have a nice day! You too, Matthew!
@HighHeatStats @HenleyFrey71 @sportcardbacks I blame you for spreading false rumors. But I guess that makes you a normally functioning citizen of the internet so it's ok!
New pre-Thanksgiving ep of @NBCTheWall TONIGHT at 8/7c on @nbc! Take a one hour break from our country's toxic news cycles to catch a breath of humanity! https://t.co/Ke1tPmyLRY
@insanetty @latelateshow It's kind of dangerous! Matterhorn we always skip though. That one is 100% an injury sled.
@shadipetosky @dominickevans Thank you!!! That is a perfect and wonderful present!
Good times last night on the ol' @latelateshow! https://t.co/8365ojtr2e
@BrianReganComic Excited to watch your special this weekend!
@luke6stars @larainenewman @dan_aykroyd If you can smile with shit in your pants YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING. Go get em tiger!!
@luke6stars @larainenewman @dan_aykroyd it's hard to smile when you're shitting your pants. try it. see how you do.
@wayneadam No, it wouldn‚Äôt. It would feel too fast and you wouldn‚Äôt connect with the contestants as well. 30 min actually means 21 min. :)
@mighty_jeff @NBCTheWall haha well the show is about the contestants not me! so that's probably why.
Special airing of @NBCTheWall tomorrow night!!! Thanksgiving balls shall drop! https://t.co/Qq6xlhEVG7
@PaulTheDesigner @rickygervais @nerdist Funny to hear that when you consider that the old @rickygervais podcast was an inspiration to my show. Everything comes around! The entertainment snake is very much dining on his own tail! Hat tip to you, Ricky!
@james_jarrell The hell are you talking about
@michelemorrow @LydiaHearst @AMAs MY HAIR IS ALL REAL (heyooooooooooo)
@PhabulousPapa Thank you!!
@prestotom @LydiaHearst @AMAs She knows how to throw it too!
@laurendoesthis It‚Äôs such a great idea!!! Well done!!
@ForFansxFans Sweeeeeeet shoot me an email at stuff@nerdist.com
@melissabrownesq It was @PaulSmithDesign
@MrsDarylDixon10 @TaraLynnB08 @AMCTalkingDead She said she would!
@vwgn76 Nope it was all live! I raced across town to make it!
It was an absolute pleasure presenting at the #AMAs w/ @LeaMichele! Thank you, Lea!! Now racing across town to jump into the @AMCTalkingDead chair in a little more than an hour!
@knowgle High cholesterol. Had to radically change my diet.
@rhlutz @CriticalRole @nerdist YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
@botsnmonsters @LydiaHearst That's a murderable offense, right?
Yeah @LydiaHearst I better get a SEPARATE birthday turkey this year! ü¶ÉüéÇ https://t.co/MHzCky8JM8
@heathercampbell @LydiaHearst VR tends to make me a bit pukey anyway so I'd be one of those people. But I guess I could just pretend it's a shout? DOVAKHWARRRRRRRRF (ptoo...ptoo) rawrfffffffffff.
YESSSS @LydiaHearst bought me Skyrim for the Switch. I am excited to spend another year and a half shouting at dragons. Now if we could juuuuust get moving on porting Portal &amp; Bioshock over there I'LL BE SET FOR LIFE.
@AlanTudyk What rhymes with that though?

@jdeeezyy10 Actually I‚Äôve been sober for 14 years. Time to get that prescription checked, friend! :)
@Ninjamonkky Also works!
I also clumsily introduced myself to @Oprah. HI I'M CHRIS I AM ALSO PRESENTING AN AWARD HERE TONIGHT PLEASE LIKE ME. I didn't say the "please like me" part but it was gushing out of my pores. Anyway she's rad and I'm awkward.
I had the honor of inducting Joan Rivers (whom I deeply miss) into the @TelevisionAcad Hall of Fame last night and I took @NerdistMom. On the red carpet, she made this sportsy @univmiami hand gesture for her alma mater and, in her words, "For @TheRock". https://t.co/eK6ZvWvYv4
Sunday Sunday SUNDAYYYYYYYYYY (please read in Monster Truck commercial voice for full effect) https://t.co/bgVOzZsihh
@CaleyChase hey we just met at the TV Academy thing and my wife @LydiaHearst said she went to school with your sister! Small, small world. Nice meeting you all! #TheLawrencevilleSchool
@Quintaine I did bid against him for that! But glad it went to a good home.
@JMedic0608 Welcome to Twitter! Thank you both for enjoying the show!! #hugs
@davidhamilton83 It was a secret gem for folks like you!! #WhatACountry
@eatdrinkbeard Just a cold! Thanks man!!
@Hootie43 @AMCTalkingDead I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt know that
Very excited to see @TiffanyHaddish kill it hosting @nbcsnl tonight! She‚Äôs real deal hilarious. Always one of my @midnight fave comics.
@SammLevine @Gatzby42 @nerdist Oh well in THAT case, ok.
@LydiaHearst WE NEED ROOM FOR THE VINTAGE TAXIDERMY
@SammLevine @Gatzby42 @nerdist Well...ok then...
@SammLevine @Gatzby42 @nerdist Too many crushing defeats by your hands at DLM. It's...it's just too painful...YOU ARE TOO SMART WITH STUFF SAMM
@rboulding @nerdist @jonnybernthal @netflix It's helpful if you do. Just gives you a base background on Frank Castle.
The @nerdist podcast today has @jonnybernthal who is such a great dude. If you were a fan of his before, you will be a bigger one after you listen: https://t.co/w8r2AqRVI1
@ballsinplay technically they're all from Gremlins 2 ;)
@theteacherchris @jimandsamshow Thanks Chris! I appreciate that!
@MikeUSA86 I do love me some Starbucks! I‚Äôm gonna quit my jobs and go do that right now. Have a nice day, Li‚Äôl Pitbull! Keep making ‚ÄòMerica great again.

@MikeUSA86 How on EARTH did you get butthurt from that tweet?? I tell you what...I‚Äôll be more funny if you look like less of a movie douchebag. ;)
@MikeUSA86 Whoa with gold like like that it‚Äôs no wonder you‚Äôre such a success! Keep on winning, my friend!
@jonathancoulton @Ceasar209 This guy you know...does he live in a pineapple under the sea???

@deadmau5 At the very LEAST you should have this https://t.co/Pfz2f4E58W
@deadmau5 That would be amazing! How about bog people? Would that count??(smashcut to us with shovels, furiously digging up your entire back yard) https://t.co/2BnLZwrTdP
@deadmau5 Thanks!! Feels good man. Looks like we have a lot of the same stuff! Museum taxidermy, etc. but my wife also collects horror movie props. And we gots some sweet pinball! #nerdfolk
@deadmau5 Apparently we are supposed to be friends https://t.co/Z4LQqre4ym
@PaulSpratt @CarolinesonBway ok just hang back in the showroom after the show and tell them I agreed to sign your book. Ask them to come get me!
@PaulSpratt @CarolinesonBway hi! which show are you coming to? I'm sure we can figure it out!

@kidcadet IT WAS NO DREAM
@AviWisnia @midnight If it's not on comedy central's website, it might not be available anymore...Sorry about that!!
@DannyTRS Hahaha that would be cool
@kresnek @Apple Yup! It's real crappy!

Dear @Apple, I'm sorry I did this w/ your iPhone X Animoji. I'm stuck at LAX on a loooong flight delay, so WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE REALLY??? https://t.co/kWPIz58fve
@scrosb0711 ehhhhh....a few weeks ago? :)
NYC! I'll be at @CarolinesonBway Wed-Fri for @nycomedyfest! Get tix here quick! https://t.co/EW1ztmEbDi
@alexisohanian @midnight You tall, beautiful man you ‚ù§Ô∏è
@xenex11 @Charles_XII @AppleSupport IÔ∏è guess it DOES take a genius to see what that percentage is out of 3.3 million. I‚Äôll hold while you grab a cal-ca-later. :)
@ideirdre I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a running inside joke.
@BradyDarnell I'm sorry I don't remember, but whatever it was I respect your courage to apologize and happily accept! Thank you! :)
@mikemorhaime @michelemorrow @KazulGFox @Blizzard_Ent Mike, I had such an amazing time. The Blizzard community is wonderful and something to be proud of. Thank you for having me!!! :)
@KBartlez I loved it! I'd do it any year they ask and I'm in town.
@KBartlez OMG ARE YOU BAH RAM YOU FAN KEN??? Also, the level of cosplay is off the charts at Blizzcon. Such a great event.
@lucyannebridge @CarolinesonBway @nycomedyfest I would LOVE to do that! We'd have to do it at 3am your time though! (cuz it's live)
@erickgomez I did finally figure that out! Thank you though!
@wilw @AppleSupport Uh I'm pretty sure it's spelled JEENYUS
@AndreaButera @AppleSupport I have the X!
@KrackedKandy @AppleSupport I have it
@Charles_XII @AppleSupport Here's another one...don't make the same joke that 1000 other people make when I ask a question like that. ;)
So uh...this keeps popping up. Any @AppleSupport genii out there have any suggestions? Nothing is downloading that I know of... https://t.co/hGVHva0Eff
@pittsadelphia At least I'm not rude to other people whenever I get a bug up my ass about something I don't like. I just avoid the things that annoy me. :)
@Coffee4Dessert I loved being back!
@oogledorf Everyone in the show is GREAT but I do think that a lot of these 10 episode shows could just be 6 episode shows to move them along.
Fuckin A if @CameronBrittonH doesn't get an Emmy for Ed Kemper in @MINDHUNTER_ there is something not right.
@p_s_1 Don't know yet! Just got it last night. Charges fast though.
@simstephen Right??? I get a lot of punches on the ol' webz so sometimes it hard to tell who's kidding or not. Today, I made the error! Apologies!
@simstephen Oh! In THAT case, GOOF ON! And sorry for misinterpreting! #hugs
My last ‚ÄúI‚Äôll connect you‚Äù tweet was supposed to be a DM but I‚Äôm leaving it public just to see how people respond to it.
@pabloknows Yeah fuck us for liking a thing and expressing an polite opinion. Not more annoying than your overtly negative crap I promise.
IMHO if you‚Äôre having the ‚Äúis it worth it‚Äù thing w/ iPhone X, IT IS. Smaller, faster and Face ID is great. I already don‚Äôt miss the 7. FWIW.
Ok cool. I‚Äôll connect you this week!
@kvsmith @nerdist Wasn‚Äôt he great?? Laurence is rad. (PRW too)
@Sincados Thanks man!!

@ChaseWoodGrains @MattMira @jonahray it's under lock and key
@RoxItRoxIt I love it. It's basically a war movie right now.
Rip off? Maybe. Does that make it bad? Absolutely not! @RashisTVUgly is brilliant &amp; all good fan driven shows can benefit from an aftershow! https://t.co/paJMWEhFpI
@ciaomichaella @wwwbigbaldhead @AMCTalkingDead @1iota Yes! @1iota please hook her up! She‚Äôs a very nice and supportive fan!!

@SturdyHugh @WalkingDead_AMC Now that's just weird. "SASSY"???
@DrWho345 People are adorably clueless. It is INSANELY illegal to cheat on a game show. Like jail-able and ruin your life-able.
@PopsForPatients @TriStarComicCon I would be honored to donate a signed one!
@drty311 @AMCTalkingDead BECAUSE NO ONE CAN ANSWER THAT AND HE WASN'T ON THIS EPISODE. That's how. :)
@kilo_hjk @AMCTalkingDead Haha I know right??!
@DrawFour That would be AWESOME
@lobb_dustin Heh thank you! But kinda tied up at AMC. :)
@chris_ryall There's no real talking on the show, though. I just put a key in the guest's head and we open it &amp; look inside.
@KimBBurton @nerdist @MattMira @jonahray Hey yeah! In that case, HAPPY 10,000 EPISODES. They're best episodes. And the yugely smartest!
@KimBBurton @nerdist @MattMira @jonahray cool idea but I don't think we'll be quite to 1000 at ID10T!
@Heather_Horton @LydiaHearst YOUR WORK IS AMAZING
People really need to experience what it‚Äôs like to live in @phirm‚Äôs head https://t.co/CijVgEcRYw

@danharmon Duffer Man OOOO YEAHHHH! See you at Duffer Gardens.
TWO @nerdist podcasts this week! The Duffer Brothers talking Stranger Things and Greg Kinnear! Flood your ears with them.
@SparrowCosplay @HeyBigSteve13 Warcraft 1, 2, Starcraft, Diablo 1 &amp; 2, all the expansion packs...now some Overwatch. I rarely saw the light of day.
@michelemorrow @PlayOverwatch Ok but I want to play Winston. I love the idea of a gorilla going to the optometrist.
Very excited to come back to BlizzCon!!! The event is incredible and the folks were really nice to me last time. See you in a week! https://t.co/DUBjU3CAZx

@nclinch No, dork, real geeks use Linux based things. And they don‚Äôt make those claims because they don‚Äôt need to. Enjoy your Android viruses.
@JRegner what did it translate to?
@KenPlume can I go now?

Ahhhh so when you go in to get your next set of Invisalign trays they floss your teeth with a belt sander to make space. Good to know.
@traceylyno @TheWalkingDead @AMCTalkingDead It‚Äôs so dumb but our show is categorized as tv-14 so the different rating has different rules. :/
@PieterJKetelaar @NY_Comic_Con Jesus dude why. So rude. So so rude.
@g_holesak Well hello then!!
@CandyECane2 Thank you!!
@tomthedog I promise I won‚Äôt!!! If I ever got tix I‚Äôd give them to my mom who‚Äôs DYING to go!

@em29me In a world where people can be toxic to one another easily, it means a lot to me when they aren't. Have a great day! See you Sunday!!! :)
@em29me But again, I appreciate your fandom and understand where you're coming from, so thank you for being polite &amp; cool w/ your suggestion!!!
@em29me ...the guest is feeling, and guide the questioning from there. If I'm too rigid in what I want, it can be dissonant if they're not ready.
@em29me ...years of chat shows, interviews and podcast experience talking here so I hope you understand. I always feel it out and see how...
@em29me ...that sometimes the lighter questions EASE people in so they're more open &amp; comfortable getting into the heavier stuff. This is...
@em29me This is a fantastic suggestion! And also one that I have asked before S8. But definitely happy to do it again! But you have to understand...
@jjmfaraway Sure! stuff@nerdist.com
@jjmfaraway WOWWWWWWW I gotta post that
@clydetombaugh @kevinandbean I know right! That was back in the draconian days of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs  emotionally scar children for their own good‚Äù.
@renzoid1 @nerdist @TaranKillam THANK YOU
I‚Äôm so proud to stand by my @punyent partner @shadipetosky to support this!!! https://t.co/MHuIOAaYD6

@Kari_Nautique Good job! Stay strong!

@cruiserfilms Workin‚Äô on it!!
In the new @nerdist podcast @TaranKillam &amp; I talk about those fucked up Red Asphalt films they used to show at driver‚Äôs ed. Do they still??
@OwlMoonJC That‚Äôs encouraging actually!
@ShawnGarrett niiiiiiice
@ShawnGarrett Oh shit is that out or do you have a review copy?
@Dorianwallace nice work!
Ok Cuphead is STUNNING but daaaaaaaaaaamn is it hard. Reminds me of old school 3-strikes-and-yer-out arcade games.
@ChloeSullivanJ @rustyrockets This clean path will pay so many dividends, I promise. And you have taken the difficult first step. Stay strong! YOU CAN DO IT!! :)
@ChloeSullivanJ @rustyrockets First off, congratulations!! We all have ?? days but just focus on getting through one at a time. Get support, AA or whatever works.
@therealcp I haven‚Äôt been to a concert in ages! I never went to a lot of them.
@muk8 Nooooooooooooooooooo
@ChrisWarcraft That tracks
@BshowBrian That's comforting, thanks! It's been 24 hours so far.
How long can a light ringing in your ears last after a loud concert (even though you had ear plugs in)? Twitter=THE BEST medical advice

@lizacious @FearTWD Noooooo that's not this season.
@coryholland Ok nooooooo! I got it from @jewelrybyjohan
@JacobyIsMyName Try it! No matter how it goes if you want to get up and do it again as soon as possible then you‚Äôre doing the right thing!
@comicsbeerscifi 2 days ago!
@kevinpollak @TheWrap You know me! I‚Äôm a slacker.

@HavocNinja37 @LydiaHearst @jason_blum @blumhouse @DEADLINE That's why I gotta do it!
Hey! I'm gonna make horror movies w/ @jason_blum! It 100% happened DURING his @nerdist podcast. Here's the deets: https://t.co/gd9aDJt6n9
@MannOnFilm Interesting idea...........MWAHAHAHA
@joosh82 Yes I‚Äôve thought about it! My original idea was to put it out as an album for charity but that was too hard for legal reasons.
@RalphTW09 Mayyyyyybeeeeeeeee
Really fantastic @nerdist podcast today w/ @jason_blum talking horror. Loved chatting w/ him. And @jonahray sat in!! Just like olden times!

@hoodshee @TMZ from the files of Police Squad!
@EMcCutchan ...on AA myself, but for people who are lost or have few options it‚Äôs an excellent place to start. Hope that helps!
@EMcCutchan ...something of a control freak, it‚Äôs actually about surrendering control. I actually have a good therapist so I don‚Äôt rely heavily...
@EMcCutchan I am, but what you come to learn is that it doesn‚Äôt literally mean God. It can for some, but since alcoholism has a lot to do w/ being...

@Grey_Fenn No, you‚Äôre not. But consider yourself lucky that you don‚Äôt understand it. :)
@Mark_Sheppard @mary_1977 Cheers with a club soda! :)
@Grey_Fenn That‚Äôs a fundamental misunderstanding of addiction. Some of us CAN‚ÄôT do moderation. That‚Äôs the point. Good for you if you can!
@MadBroTweets Thanks!
@CalebDevine Therapy helps! So does AA. Both are a support structure that will help in complementary ways.
@JRid23 You have the strength yourself! You can do it. Congratulations on taking the first step!
@KillThisArtist Thank you!! Much appreciated! :)
@Jimmythehat1 @cyborgturkey @WalkingDead_AMC No I never was in the same room with it!

@clydetombaugh Thanks Bean! :)
@RS6_Schultz 4 is pretty damn fantastic! You should absolutely appreciate the value of that accomplishment.
Heyyy 14 years of sobriety today! If you're thinking about it, JUST DO IT. Now. Just stop. You can. Go to AA. We'll be sober bday siblings!

@alyssarpapa I hope you had a wonderful time at your wedding!! Congratulations to you both!
@PattyMarvel @MattGrandis Thanks for remembering!
@TheWiccanChick @midnight Points to that!
@Kiburi21 ...the best vantage point so this kind of dialogue is helpful &amp; appreciated to make sure I do the best job possible for the fans. So thanks!
@Kiburi21 ...because of passionate fans like you so it‚Äôs important to me to listen when someone has well-expressed concerns. I don‚Äôt always have...
@Kiburi21 You didn‚Äôt say anything block worthy! You expressed your critique thoughtfully and without insult. We are lucky enough to be at MSG...
@Kiburi21 I sincerely hope you have a better night! :)
@Kiburi21 ...these are some great insights to consider and I thank you for sharing them! My apologies that the panel wasn‚Äôt what you hoped for.
@Kiburi21 With all due respect that was one quick moment. All of the actors did get a chance to speak and they all discussed their characters. But...
@Kiburi21 And the audience questions are never vetted. All fan questions are welcome. :)
@Kiburi21 Sorry you felt that way! I guess this is your first panel! They CAN‚ÄôT discuss the new season. But thank you for coming! :)
@MrKurtLockwood @TheRealElvira @knottsscaryfarm Well thank you for that! Much appreciated re: dad. Twitter is tricky! I don‚Äôt always see everything. Hugs from the man child! :)

@Notorious_cec That's exactly what I did! Thankfully it worked.
@designbychrism Didn't read the whole tweet, huh? ;)

@sutherlandkaty I know it‚Äôs only because you‚Äôre a wonderful fan! Thank you for understanding!!
@sutherlandkaty But I do appreciate that you came! Sorry I couldn‚Äôt say hi afterwards. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm being a jerk. :)
@sutherlandkaty It‚Äôs b/c there isn‚Äôt enough time for the club to load the late show. And after the last show the staff would be here for 2 extra hours. :)
@alyssalambs But since we‚Äôre serious now I do think that their ‚Äúfame at all cost‚Äù M.O. is not a great example for young people.
@alyssalambs I think it‚Äôs always best to take a dumb joke as seriously as possible ;) if someone tweeted a joke like that at me I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at all.
@Laneit360 Thank you!!
@Steveokdwb Right after we fork?
@diegosaldivar Hahahaha points

@kingsven3598 @AcmeComedyCo Sadly no! It will be too late. Last time was after only one show but we wouldn‚Äôt get to glam doll‚Äôs until 1am. After 2 shows I‚Äôll be tired!
@nicklefangirl No, sadly we can't. It would keep the staff there hours after they are supposed to leave. In that case about 2am.
@daltoncochrane Oh yeah I haven‚Äôt been in there in AGES
@Vallture @HomeDepot Then you seriously need to get your eyes checked. You definitely need glasses!

@brandonthebuck haven't had any problems with mine so far!
@NinjitsuPrincss ok what show and how many tix?
@DrawFour @NinjitsuPrincss @AcmeComedyCo I'll get you tix to whatever show you want Bridget! Just let Michelle know.
@PeterTFellows Great! It's very addictive, even though it's calming.
@NinjitsuPrincss @DrawFour @AcmeComedyCo what day? I can bring it for a photo but it will be too hot to perform in!
@PeterTFellows It's called "Animal Crossing"

@Invisalign Haha ok ok I'll pay! I'll pay!!!
@TSciant Hm. I'm not sure what you listened to but within the show there were 2 plugs in 43 minutes &amp; they were fun. Sorry you hated it! :)
@TSciant It really wasn't a long ad. It was a completely separate story. But you gotta feel good about going out of your way to drop some negativity!

@AeonVoid1 I'll definitely reschedule!
@AeonVoid1 I accidentally scheduled the same weekend as New York comic con. It wa set up months ago, so I didn't know NYCC dates and I'm working there.
@Naters305 @trello Gonna give it a try!
@Cody_Belanger Hey my power move!!!
@MsShoegal @WalkrStalkrCon No they built their own! Or they're building it. It's possibly they used clips of our version in the meantime.
@trello Hello! I have some questions about which account solution might work best for me. Is there anyone I can talk to? Thanks!
@MsShoegal I think it might be. I wish they'd air our version! Then I could come tour Australia! Haven't been there since the 90s.
@MsShoegal Really?? When did it say it was on? That's neat! I thought Australia was making its own version.
@Jeffrey_Kieviet I appreciate you for that!
@HeadlyvonNoggin Walking Dead doesn't follow the comics exactly either. Awaiting snarky comeback in 3...2...
@Josefism I consulted an actual doctor. They're to balance out my system from the harsh antibiotics.
@HeadlyvonNoggin And the fact that it uses outrageous humor and hyper-reality as a storytelling device is a comparison you don't have to be a genius to see.
@HeadlyvonNoggin @preacher @SouthPark Yeah I did. Deal with it. Different people have different opinions. Learn it. Live it. Love it.

@TaraKalton Thanks!
#FrakeNews https://t.co/2OdYvMOm9J
@Ziptduda ENT said a big NO to that. When there's infection irrigating spears it around apparently. Neti pot is good for preventative! :)
@geepease Just to be safe, yeah maybe catch up first.
mare see https://t.co/ntmtdT0AaN
@AMFisch guess I could have just looked that up. STILL I'll bet people are sharply divided anyway! (and thank you)
Gahhh sinus infection! I have to get up to take probiotics 3 hrs before food/antibiotics. But the BIG question is...La Croix sparkling H20:
@thestevestrout Yeah this was totally my fault. I foolishly didn't check the dates for NYCC and found out I'm supposed to go out for WD stuff. I'm sorry!!!
Hey #Tacoma! I'm so sorry but I have to reschedule the Oct. dates, which I will do asap. I have to work at NYCC that weekend. My mistake!!!
@malcolmbarrett Hahahahaha
@Noobface You're kidding, right? This is a tough one to swallow but here goes...NOT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME OPINION AS YOU. I know. Take a moment.
@og_xvKiDvx @AndrewLincolnFP Except that that's not Andy's twitter account and Kirkman says the Z word all the time. So it's all okay! :)
@UltimateTaker @AMC_TV Oh all right I forgive you! Have a good night! :)
@mkeggers7 @donttrythis Time Bandits? Or Time After Time?
@awood1971 Thanks Adam!
@UltimateTaker @AMC_TV Well that's rude AF. FYI, NO ONE wants to hear that. No one. Ever. Good tip for future interactions with other humans!
Tonight! @AMCTalkingDead season 8 preview, followed by the RETURN of @FearTWD and then Talking Dead for THAT! #phew #SundayZombieSunday https://t.co/gkkYmHT5h8
@kurt_murphy I honestly don't know! I go in my dressing room &amp; take very deep breaths after each taping. Does it air there or are you watching online?
@TeiganJLedbury Well in that case HAPPY 20th BIRTHDAY!!!
@MannySalazar New drinking game: when someone does the "drinking game" bit.
@jennyzigrino awesome! yes please! you should do a drop in set!
@johntmhiggins you've got a good point there
Hey @ConManSeries w/ @NathanFillion &amp; @AlanTudyk is airing on @SYFY tonight at 10/9c and there's a contest for viewers of signed goods! https://t.co/8sZGpAYXrk
My friend @tomjdeters lost his dog Zen (pitbull mix) in Castaic, CA off I-5 past Magic Mountain. Please help! ANY info: tomjdeters@gmail.com https://t.co/0Ah4txCY2p
Conveniently, it could still be called "Talking Dead". Or if I can't get approval from AMC I'll go with "After Life". https://t.co/MHRg2Rbq76
@benjennys :)
@benjennys confirm that you can see the same pic everyone else can see and then you'll know ;)
Hugs to the Futurama cast for Radiorama! @phillamarr @MAURICELAMARCHE @KateySagal @TheJohnDiMaggio @TheBillyWest @LaurenTom9000 Dave Herman
@MAURICELAMARCHE And he loves you back ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE! A NEW episode of Futurama is coming to @nerdist in podcast form! (and I'm in it!) https://t.co/TJHGuBuSio #Radiorama https://t.co/eu4WCjgWG9
@JordanMueck @LydiaHearst That's so cool of you! Really nice meeting you, Jordan!!
@rhardesty12 Nope it's not!
@BustedTees Hey! I just ordered this in a medium but was curious if you had any hidden smalls left lyin' around? https://t.co/H4Vd2m4XDo
@c_s_anderson Yeah but I didn't have enough room in my tweet for that joke. Stupid 140 characters!
YESSS!! The British remake of Billy Madison...William Madison: "You know I like snack trifle WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ME A SNACK TRIFLE?!" https://t.co/MEKxb1Ak0T
Ah yes. OF COURSE it's a uniform. Hey @NerdistMom is it too late to send me to boarding school? I'll drop out as soon as I get the sweater!! https://t.co/8j2XRi5NL5
@scotthertzberg @talking üôåüèª
There's a @nerdist podcast HOSTFUL episode up today! Recorded in June at @ID10Tfest! Enjoy the majesty of @MattMira &amp; @jonahray!
@taddgood Yes! I need to see how the sound quality is on that one. That was the issue with some of them. It would annoy you MORE if it sounded bad!
@Ty_McNamara :)
@rissadee I would love to contact him and tell him I'm glad he's okay!! Also nice meeting you!
@LibrarySherpa @nerdist Ahhhhhhhh ok! Good catch!
@LiverightPub @talking @neiltyson WHAT IS THAT COVER STOCK??? It is the best.
Forthe Windsor #UnlikelyRoyalBabyNames
Ohhhh fun! A trending hashtag game! I remember these!!! Ok ok...THIRDLY WINDSOR #UnlikelyRoyalBabyNames
@ChrisWarcraft Not a bad idea at all!
@TeddyHiFive Hi Teddy. I'm a promotional bottle of sauce made in a limited quantity. I don't have a date stamped on me. Yes, I accept your apology.
Not opened, but it was promotional so there's no "use by" date stamped on it. https://t.co/aUZ2PG6ROa
Hey @McDonalds or anyone! This has been in my fridge unopened for at least 8 months. Is it still edible? DON'T LIE TO ME, INTERNET. https://t.co/nfypL39d1k
@Daveyou13 We shot it last week!
@Stan_Spooner Thank you Stan!
@Brad_Griswold Hey congratulations!!
@SharronLukens I think you know the answer to that ;)
@R_Scott_Taylor @ActuallyNPH if we do more than I will beg him to come on!
@seanxxxsmith @QueenSaviorXD @NeilDeGrTyson Naw you're not an asshole! Twitter's text only interface lends itself to misunderstandings. I extend a hearty handshake/hug to you, friend!
@seanxxxsmith @QueenSaviorXD @NeilDeGrTyson Neil Tyson is @neiltyson not @NeilDeGrTyson. #QED
@seanxxxsmith @QueenSaviorXD @NeilDeGrTyson No no no just teasing back!! Not shitting on you for real!! It's all fun and games!! I'm so sorry!!!
@seanxxxsmith @QueenSaviorXD @NeilDeGrTyson That is some real deal nerd cred there, Sir. I salute you!!
@seanxxxsmith @QueenSaviorXD @NeilDeGrTyson I don't think my wife or Molly would appreciate that! HEYOOOOOOOOOOOOO ok we're all friends here so hugs all round!!! :D
@seanxxxsmith @QueenSaviorXD @NeilDeGrTyson That's awesome to hear! But you totally missed a Hogwarts ref AND mistagged Neil's account so forgive me for assuming based on that info. ;)
@QueenSaviorXD But you are a fair and just Queen! Excellent Hufflepuff qualities. Thank you for playing along! :)
@QueenSaviorXD @seanxxxsmith @NeilDeGrTyson Ha!! It's always funny when normies accidentally stomp through the nerd garden.
@Ty_McNamara You mean like the one with Damon Lindelof a few weeks back?
@MidnightMorbius Wig!
@jlyons445 Daaaaaaamn that's pricey!!
@QueenSaviorXD OHHHHHHH never mind. Just saw that you're a Hufflepuff. That explains it. Here I'll give you this one -&gt; YES that's me #Ravenclaw4Life
@QueenSaviorXD I mean there'd be no way to acquire that information. You'd need all human knowledge easily accessible in some kind of "inter-network". ;)
@Choofabulous @nerdist @Cudlitz HA! Amazing.
@mradamscott @kagune_kun @Lin_Manuel @travismcelroy @JohnRossBowie @jamiedenbo @hallublin @fwong @MrDrewScott @MrSilverScott @MissyElliott You've been spoiled alphabetically, Adam
@TheTVGod Yes. Yes it was.
@AlmaWheat @JJWatt I did and I will!
@RocketBats It was the strongest one I had and an area where I felt I had he most to offer
@RocketBats Thanks! I would have stayed longer but the hotel needed to braak down the room sadly.
@emmcgoobz @nerdist It is! It's called Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues by @anamanaguchi
CONGRATULATIONS to my amazing wife @LydiaHearst!!! https://t.co/tl96NtFOeu
@renetetrault Ironic that your profile says "fuck be haters", isn't it ;)
@cmoore82LAM It's not super frequent but it does happen and I'm always delighted when it does. I loved working on that movie!
@realbadger @talking Ok! My misinterpretation. Apologies!
@A_Lucio_Galvan I'm great at riffing! Bad at structured improv games. Not far off on your assessment though!
@realbadger @talking Why the sarcastic quotes around "tonight"? Lots of shows are pre-taped. We do the best we can with the production schedule we're given.
@CataclysmGames @talking PS I got spoiler shit once from a podcast where we talked about The Godfather. No joke.
@CataclysmGames @talking OMG THANK YOU. It's the internet, ya know, and not everyone has a sense of humor about, well, anything. PHEW. Ok carry on!!
@CataclysmGames @talking you're shitting me right? you're going to call "spoiler" on a show that ENDED 7 YEARS AGO? this is a joke. this has to be a joke.
@RhysThom2 Really fantastic work on Comrade! So so good.
@run_emcd Sure!
Neil is always a phenomenal chat but PARTICULARLY phenomenal on this one. So stop reading this and go watch or listen, You! https://t.co/W9mgxO1DgB
@ShameOnBill ...you think the handful of times I've made fun of sports obsession, TRY to imagine how fucking annoying it is to hear about it all the time
@ShameOnBill Because literally EVERY person I encountered said "so ya here for be fight??? And launched into their thoughts on it. However annoying...
@BeccaDisney87 I heard it was there but didn't have time to stop by! Next time!
@ShameOnBill Zing! I'm sawry did I hurt your sports feelings?
@NEILMAHONEY @channingtatum Jonah told me you edited it! Neil, it's really is amazing! Nice work!!
@JessieAztlan I did! Enjoyed it! Was bummed they split the season at 6 &amp; 6. Makes sense for an hour long show but not as much for a 25 min show.
Holy shit Comrade Detective on Amazon is INCREDIBLE. So fucking funny &amp; original. Nice job @channingtatum! (also Brian Gatewood/Alex Tanaka)
@backermann @talking Thanks Bryan!
@AlanTudyk DANGERBOAT!!!
@Dvann562 And "pushes too much". ONE DAMN TWEET about an ACTUAL experience yesterday. SMDH.
@Dvann562 I'm just me. I'm allowed to have opinions. Of the HANDFUL of times I make jokes it PALES to how much our culture shoves sports in our faces.
It took every ounce of improv training I've ever had to fake my way through 900 conversations in Vegas about that damn MvM fight.
@SteveMartinToGo Lovely meeting you as well! The show was hilarious! Somewhere that hemp soaked audience guy is still figuring out how to pelvic thrust...
@JeffBabko Indeed it 'twas! Thanks man!
If you ever get a chance to see the  @SteveMartinToGo &amp; Martin Short live show YOU NEED TO DAMN WELL DO IT. It's fantastic!!!
@scorchingshark @Cudlitz @TheIsaJones @nerdist @WalkingDead_AMC No worries a'tall! :)
@scorchingshark @TheIsaJones The promotion aspect is about 1% of the shows but everyone's entitled to their opinion! They're still free flowing convos, fwiw. :)
@TheIsaJones @nerdist @Cudlitz @WalkingDead_AMC I'm not 100% sure what your complaint is here
The @nerdist podcast today is a GREAT chat w/ @Cudlitz. Take a listen! @WalkingDead_AMC
@alisonhaislip Nicely done
@Not_POTUS_17 @SteveMartinToGo @innoutburger @Whataburger Opinions are like assholes! Everyone else's are shitty.
UH HI HOW DO I GET TICKETS??? Do you have a blocka blocka set aside? https://t.co/x2B5Taqmm3
@brendonwalsh @NBCTheWall WHO'S WATCHING YOUR BABY
So there's a boxing bout in Vegas this weekend but I'm driving there to see @SteveMartinToGo &amp; Martin Short! But 1st, BARSTOW!! #luxury https://t.co/CKCTqr0s5w
@gooniesneverdie Sure! Happy Goddamn Birthday, Ashley!
@ScottWx_TWN Feels like forever ago weirdly! And thanks!
@kagalley @elonmusk Elon &amp; I have met! He agreed to do the podcast a while back but our schedules have never synced up. Someday!
@4evaWizzie27 those are the WORST! But everything's ok! :)
@tylershields Hopefully adding lasers soon!
Also thank you to @omaze and @MakeAWish for being a part of the @TheRealStanLee event!! It's was an incredible honor for me! :)
Thank you for celebrating @TheRealStanLee with us!! Sorry for all the mic issues!! Good news: they're working now! Bad news: show's over!
@mattybv I know right??? almost NONE of them worked!!
Hosting Extraordinary @TheRealStanLee TONIGHT at @SabanTheatre at 6p! Let us honor The Generalissimo! Info: https://t.co/LBkL33v5xv https://t.co/0F0Q8yIb6W
@gymmomcat @RumorsandRants @AlbertBreer Boy oh boy do you have the wrong guy!
During the eclipse I assume most people will turn into mutants or a pile of red dust a la Night of the Comet, right?
@NateHuzie2 @midnight #hugs
Saw Annabelle Creation for our anniversary date last night. FANTASTIC horror movie! Congrats @ponysmasher!! cc @annabellemovie @LydiaHearst
@EricCoomer @neiltyson We shot the episode over two months ago. TV usually doesn't happen when you're seeing it. ;)
@JobeR1313 Sadly comedy central doesn't have a deal with netflix so my specials aren't on there!
@WookieSummerFun Absolutely!
@totomon So great. Can we see this on the other background you sent? And do you have an instagram account? I want to credit you!
@totomon I have blue eyes. R&amp;M have generic black squiggle eyes as far as I can tell
@selloutfunerals @ID10Tfest Yes!
@RealMysterie @midnight BOOM. https://t.co/4ASozZheEK
@rhiannon_cates As a matter of fact, YES!!! We already taped it. She's awesome!
@adamloring1985 I love that part of the country. I will definitely be back with new jokes and yuk em ups!
@adamloring1985 Hey wasn't that Murfreesboro??
Congratulations @angelicahale! You were amazing on @AGT last night! I really do think you could win this whole thing! You rule.
@totomon So funny to get this! I've been on an R&amp;M drawing spree myself. Will post soon! Have you an instagram? Would love to post yours too.
@SpaceCampUSA I had these babies for years. My fave pair! A gift from Mariah Coxen. They met a tragic fate beneath my clumsy foot! https://t.co/FmA3jz8Tz6
@pepe_silva06 hey thank you!!!
@AntLeonard73 It really has been. Also the podcasts are recorded usually 1-3 weeks in advance so it's also logistically difficult to be current with it.
@cheezit That's as gouda as it gets!
@JessicaChobot @docktorphaust @nerdist HUGS FOR ALL
@adsmithld Haha no I didn't sleep much then either
@tburns100 @midnight Sure!
@AntLeonard73 Thank you for listening to the show and expressing your concern kindly though! I really do appreciate that!! More people should do that! :)
@AntLeonard73 Besides, there is no shortage of places that are talking about about all the messes so it should be easy to find what you need.
@AntLeonard73 I can appreciate where you're coming from! But that's not what the show is, and there is tremendous value in temporary distraction.
@WickedAnnalist Well TECHNICALLY it's Back to the Future Rick:Morty::Doc:Marty but yes!
@cheezit @amnewsboy I love you, Cheezit
@cheezit @amnewsboy !!!!!!!!!!
@docktorphaust @nerdist @JessicaChobot THREE?? In TWO WHOLE DAYS??? Are you ok?? Where are you?? WE'LL SEND HELP!!! I mean you can't just skip them or anything. I AM SO WORRIED
@DoubleDs76 Could just be the pills ;)
@Wufwuf1 @THX0785 It happened! https://t.co/lry4MDpGlp #AtMidday
@TheFknLizrdKing I can't decide until I see how Noob Noob reacts when Beth shoots him. But I'm guessing it'd just be "godDAMN". So maybe Noob Noob?
@pixelastronaut @danharmon So you're saying that Oliver Stone just needs a sesame dipping sauce?
@shep GOOD CALL
@danharmon @pixelastronaut We'll discuss this and more coming up live on Talking Radio!!! (library music guitar riff)
Yes. I can see that now. But creating that option for yourself solidifies the outside-the-box thinking of The Other Thingers! #Victory https://t.co/xIp7jdBoNH
@SilliestMonkey @pixelastronaut @danharmon I'VE GOT A MANGINA
@THX0785 You should trademark Chower‚Ñ¢ asap
@danharmon @pixelastronaut Since it's called "Talk Radio" I would argue that ANYTIME he is talking on the radio he is validating the premise and therefore SUCCEEDING https://t.co/429ySuF5Wc
@totomon Amazing! I took a pic with him at comic con and thought we'd be a good real life R&amp;M. Now this proves it!!! And I should post that pic.
Fun day so far: pled for social media civility, suggested new @cheezit shape, launched necessary poll, bought Marcus Aurelius's Meditations
@King_WFU So would @FatboySlim, whom I hear is fucking in heaven. Fucking in fucking in fucking in heaven.
@pixelastronaut @danharmon Pickle RIIIIIIIIIIICK
@RichTerry901 Orpheum! Not sure I could fill it but cool idea! I haven't been back since my dad died. Still a bit weird for me but I'll be back some day!
Incredibly important insomnia motivated poll:
@RichTerry901 Are there any comedy venues in Memphis?? I feel like they always open for a bit and then close! There must be SOMETHING there!
@Allie_Mo_Script @nerdist He was such a sweet guy! I enjoyed chatting with him.
@JuJuBeeGrrl I WILL come to Philly for sure! Early next year probably!
@THX0785 It'll never work!!! At least, not for more than four years.
@meghan_e Thank you, Meghan! And I gotta say, using "+" as a continuation is GENIUS. I may need to adopt that. Enjoy your burrito back!!! :)
@JobeR1313 I can certainly try! Or at least for the podcast!
@cmwdotme Nice set up!!
@AdamHPhillips Haha that's very true! And expectations can lead to disappointment. BUT DAMMIT I HAVE TO HOPE!! Also, yes to chess!  (saw your profile)
@amnewsboy @cheezit They'll never share them! Unless they pay us in Nesting Cheezits, which I'm open to.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Ultimately I do appreciate that you listen &amp; care about the show. PLEASE know that I'm always open for politely constructive discussions!
@totomon https://t.co/yxuTngvJoh
@cmwdotme No I didn't get that one but I've heard it's hard AF! I have Addam's Family &amp; Walking Dead. Wife wants South Park &amp; Twilight Zone.
@amnewsboy Nesting Cheezits? I like that idea! It's like the Inception of cracker snacks.
@totomon Was that you or...was that me?
@Singularity9117 I fell asleep too early so now my brain thinks it's morning. Stupid brain. :/
@amnewsboy Yes! What would you like to see done to them? Different shape? Like little cheese otters? Or the whole box is a solid cheezit brick?
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Ok I've jammed your feed enough with my blabbering. Have a good morning! :)
Ultimately I do appreciate that you listen &amp; care about the show. PLEASE know that I'm always open for politely constructive discussions!
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist I'm not trying to pick on you I just feel it's important to get folks to understand that it's ok to communicate civilly on social media! :)
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Just to sum up: Critiques, comments, questions: FINE; Orders, entitlement, name-calling, demands: NOT FINE. Does this make sense?
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Your intention does not justify your approach, so I repeatedly tried to make it clear that your attitude was my issue, NOT your commenting.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist No one likes to admit to themselves that they're rude, but you were. I can't see what's in your head, only what you wrote.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Here's an example: "Hey! Just curious why you did X? Thanks!" as opposed to "Do this my way or you suck". Do you see the difference?
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Why is it so hard for people like you to understand that there are ways to express ideas that are NOT talking down to people like crap?
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Typical internet. It's not about "no comment". YOU. WERE. RUDE. You ordered me to do what YOU wanted and called my show "cheap".
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist I'd say that if it bothers you I understand if you unsubscribe but I'm not going to change the way it's done. Hope you have a good night! :)
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Look, you're entitled to your opinion but I'm entitled to not agree with it. Just please don't order people around who give you stuff maybe?
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist And you still haven't addressed your entitled tone, which I still don't appreciate.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist It's a bonus episode each week not "instead of". Skip it if you hate it. How hard is that? Plus it helps let people know about the show.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist No. That's confusing. Then people see two podcasts that are very similar. It forced me to compete with myself and the audience.
@blindog143 April is one of my best friends. I love having her on. I'd prefer no more you listening to the podcast. How about that instead? Solved!
@BenMakesTV @mattwilstein @JesseThorn @maddow @Oprah I'd have done it if he'd have asked :)
@Markimoofan29 Ok Happy Birthdaaaaaaaaay!
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist PS the number of people who will talk to another person like shit over free content is staggering. Truly.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist Seek to understand instead of talking down to people as a first resort. Have a nice day.
@OperaNowPodcast @nerdist I don't make "cheap" choices just to piss you off, Michael. Remember that whatever sliver of info you have is NEVER the whole story.
@OperaNowPodcast They also didn't like the messiness of TWCH in the title. I try make everyone happy but it's just not possible. Learn how to communicate.
@OperaNowPodcast Instead of ordering me around like I'm an asshole, you could ask ONE question about WHY I changed it. OTHER people complained the other way.
@JasonJKnapp @wilw @midnight You're old enough. You should get it without any help. ;)
@adamsomes @Channel7 I believe every country is getting its own version!
@Bobollie Congratulations!!! That's huge! It'll be 500 days before you know it! Hang in there, my friend!
@WhiteMorph @AcmeComedyCo We get sucked into a black hole and the universe collapses
@tapruden @Fandango I just don't think pre-sobriety pics from 15 years ago are a good representation for such a wonderful event for Stan. It's lazy googling.
Very excited to be performing in MPLS Sept 28-30 @AcmeComedyCo! Shows are filling up so grab tix righty here: https://t.co/O83V7pOfiv
@tapruden what's the link?
@tapruden Hey @fandango please use a current picture! It's okay to just ask me for one instead of taking whatever is closest on the internet. :)
@StaffofSage Kinda doesn't matter anymore, does it? ;)

@MNevala9 @midnight Thank you, Matt!
@KatCorbett @MikeDeeJr Y107! Those days were so much fun. And Kat is the COOLEST!!! Hope to hang sometime Ms Corbett!

@reptarwilleatu It's such a fun ep! Maybe just a little at the end though... ;)
@whatrosasaid @midnight Such a nice post! And you will absolutely work again. You're super cool and funny and you're in the right business! Thank you for being you!

@TheErinAlthaus @midnight Oh shit don't do THAT!
@MovieMantz @GeekFilter @SaucetvAwesome @PatrickE34 @MFBfilmjudge @MattMira David Marcus would disagree with you on that last point
@ShogunSkilling @nerdist ah SHIT. Missed opportunity.

@GeekFilter @SaucetvAwesome @PatrickE34 @MFBfilmjudge @MovieMantz @MattMira What I'm sensing is a type of pit competition to determine the host. I BET ONE MILLION QUATLOOS ON @MATTMIRA
@PatrickE34 @GeekFilter @MFBfilmjudge @MovieMantz I don't want someone who's as big a Trekkie as me. I want someone who goes beyond that. @MattMira is the person w/ knowledge &amp; hostyness :)
@Daelenn Excellent recommendation! Thank you
@CaseyDon17 @midnight We absolutely talked about doing that!
@AnotherBacon Your stress is coming from the idea that you're going to make a wrong decision but there isn't one! Remove that pressure. You'll be okay! :)
@AnotherBacon Make a deal w/ yourself that if the 1 you pick wasn't satisfying, listen to the other. Or give yourself option of listening in the future!
@AnotherBacon Use it as an exercise to fight anxiety. Just pick one (either one will probably be enjoyable) and be proud of that decision!
@AnotherBacon Just shut your eyes, point to one and go with that one if you don't want to hear both. Or listen to both pretend it's a 2 hour show.
@MFBfilmjudge @PatrickE34 @GeekFilter @MovieMantz @jasonsegel @Official_MilaK I have nothing to do with this show whatsoever. But the MOST logical host choice is @MattMira IMO. :)
@blainecapatch This folds nicely into my Cybermen of the Cloth fanfic
@AnotherBacon Most guests come on during a PR cycle so we HAVE to agree to post on specific days or we don't get them. Sorry but it just is how it is!
@AnotherBacon So you skip BOTH? That just doesn't make any sense. No offense meant, but can you see how that would come off kind of entitled?
@Mr_N_Churchill @midnight Of course! I'm so glad I watched that special on how plumbuses are made.
@AnotherBacon @marcmaron Respectfully, no. Both shows are free &amp; not the same convo. Maybe stagger when you listen to each? Or, ya know, get over it. :)
@dabusdown @midnight points!
@bluemonkey318 @midnight I applaud you for having five foot ten inch pockets!!! That's pretty impressive. Also thanks for the ACTUAL pocket sized me!
YOU could hang out w/ Marvel legend Stan Lee at his tribute night in LA (I'm hosting)! LOOK HERE: https://t.co/z7Le0CB9U8 @omaze @MakeAWish https://t.co/XHzQW92gF1
@GuerrillaSmith Congratulations on 4 years!!! That's fantastic!
@theonowicki @midnight Oh wow I almost got Wick Rolled!
@Blacklightninja @maxbrooksauthor @nerdist As a matter for fact YES! We have another one recorded that's coming out soon!
@EbenZboch @midnight points
@hannah_culkin @midnight Thank you!
@scorchingshark @midnight E. All
@WiseSageBum @RealMysterie @midnight @nerdist No!
@TFGeekGirl YES
When do you brush your teeth?
@pepe_silva06 https://t.co/m7GWi1NraE
@Ed_Betts Good question! We do it that way so the other person has ample time to make their decision.
@RiepTide1999 @midnight Thank you!!
@RickGrimezsz @talking @AMC_TV @janemarielynch That's only 20 minutes, really. I'll be watching it too!
@vanderjames I am beyond delighted that Yoda has a true Padawan with him at all times!! Poor li'l guy was bored by my lack of training.
There's a new @talking episode tonight at 11/10c on @AMC_TV w/ @janemarielynch!! You can still watch that Throne thing &amp; make it in time.
@RealMysterie @midnight @nerdist holy shit that's fantastic!!!
@magicbulletrecs geek culture
@Boot8615 @midnight THE INTERNET: Making assumptions without knowledge since 1993 ;)
@Boot8615 @midnight Who said it was my decision to pass it on? I don't own the show man! That's a CC call. They want to focus on politics from 11-12.
@CorySeigel Got me on a technicality! But true.
@TheBrutal95 :D thanks!
@cardiotrekkie @midnight @its_pcb_ That's truly awful news. She was a bright light and very inspiring. I'm very lucky to have met her. She will be missed. #RIPNicole
@Harlan_Hawks Points!
@Harlan_Hawks Oh I probably saved it to my laptop for a bit but didn't know who took it. People post that at me whenever it airs. Sorry!!
@DavidSidoni Es una bomba muscular que mantiene circulaci√≥n
@blue_hens_chick @Starbucks https://t.co/oVuCbOV94O
@Harlan_Hawks I always credit! What was the pic???
@Whovian_BenK Not everyone who drinks has a problem! But it also depends on how you define success. And the long term effects are...not great.
@JtotheLtotheW @PTXftPotter Ugh definitely not. I hate that shit. "Sober" means "nothing". I do go to Starbucks twice a day though!
@hockeyfisch @midnight Ok points! No hauntings!!
@katebuesching @OctopusOwl @Starbucks It's really the best way! üôåüèª
@GidgetAnne AMEN TO THAT
@TotallyNatoli @yogi_barista @Starbucks I've tried it that way! It just tastes like watery chai. I think by "activates" they mean "saves us money on milk".
@MacDavis15 @aidybryant Thank you! Including @shadipetosky since she made it. Also, COOL WALL!!! That wood is amazing!
@ZakEden @Lin_Manuel @nerdist Lin is ALWAYS welcome to come on the podcast whenever he has time!!! He'd be a fantastic guest.
@BackpackingDad haha I heard it got ugly there after we left
@maulers86 @Starbucks normally yes! but the wife and I are going on a trip to a Starbucks-free location!
@nicklesbe Excellent point
@PTXftPotter @uublog Oh yes yes that one too
@Codeblind @midnight Thanks!
@LouisLaVenture1 I think I'm doing pretty well with it.
@realtomcee Drinking in and of itself doesn't mean you can't also achieve stuff! That's just how it is for some of us. :)
"Successful" https://t.co/OT4DR9aTj3
@Codeblind Some of us can't do that. :)
@realtomcee I'd rather have the focus to fulfill every dream I've ever had...but that's just me.
@TestGradeA @midnight Thank you!!
Another cure for hangovers is not drinking. :) #14Years https://t.co/KTNP8vCdOy
@OctopusOwl @Starbucks Chai lattes are made with milk. So, ya know, that's why. ;)
@sonicstopwatch @Starbucks But I already know which one I like. I hate the bagged kind! :)
@Dovil @Starbucks Solid plan!
@Nerdy_Angel The Nerdist guy is on The Wall! There are less inappropriate jokes on that one!
@yogi_barista @Starbucks NEVER water! Never. It ruins them!!! I always order without.
@STEVEN_CASIAS ok happy birthday!
THANK YOU. Also @Starbucks should stop adding water! They're way better old school style, no H20. That's how I order 'em. https://t.co/dKuViALaLs
Hey @Starbucks baristas...if I get your chai mix, how much do I put in a 12 oz cup with steamed milk?
@carriecoon @Pheramuse @midnight @_NicoTortorella Birthday birthday!
@rui @kylemooney @BrigsbyBear The producers are sending it to me. Can't wait to see it!
@OkieStotts No not really. It promotes that it's a joke with a recognizable word in a movie title. And I know. I covered them for Wired Science yrs ago.
@mikebaz Yes! Every ep is a full emotional rollercoaster! The hour that you watch takes about 2.5 to shoot so it's even more intense!
@OkieStotts Oh that. You're misinterpreting the joke. I'm not saying I literally hate them, it's a play on a movie title.
@mojomorno I support this!
@theRealCatSmith @midnight @ComedyCentral Points!
@OkieStotts I did??? What?? Did I say it or someone else?
@TheFilmConsumer @midnight Whoa TRIPLE points!
@garrettpowders @NerdistPodcast Here's the full song by @anamanaguchi! https://t.co/yNBvvW5mC0

Two excellent @nerdist podcast guests this week! @aidybryant &amp; Damon Lindelof! Stuff them in your ears for the weekend!
@GrandpaYeti @midnight :)
@GayLeftAtheist @midnight I'm on a couple other shows that hopefully also have erection-inducing performances! Thank you to you both for watching!!!
@Mndakotakid Lovely tattoo and happy to hear she's ok!
@smashlanta how about points?
@hellolanemoore @midnight Such a hilarious idea! Thank you!!
@dearestnature @NBCTheWall ha! well that was her husband so he was particularly invested!
TONIGHT! Two sisters try to squeeze $$ out of @NBCTheWall to take back to their farm in Iowa! Let's watch it together! I'll be there at 9/8c https://t.co/aa7LBru7Sq
@KimBBurton @nerdist 1920s
@KimBBurton @nerdist It's actually a 20s thing, as we pointed out on the show last night.
@AsherDavidson09 @midnight @JustinMcElroy @griffinmcelroy @ComedyCentral @TheDailyShow @iamjohnoliver But you should know that I don't seriously blame Millennials for anything. They're just dumb jokes. I make fun of my goofball gen too, man!
@TammerRamini @midnight Wow if you were willing to do THAT I'm sure @1iota can find a seat for you! Thanks!
@AsherDavidson09 @midnight @JustinMcElroy @griffinmcelroy @ComedyCentral @TheDailyShow @iamjohnoliver So I apologize that it bummed you out! That certainly wasn't the intention. I hope you have a better day, Asher! :)
@AsherDavidson09 @midnight @JustinMcElroy @griffinmcelroy @ComedyCentral @TheDailyShow @iamjohnoliver ...fair to laugh at comedy that lands near other people and the SECOND it lands near you go on a tweet storm. None of it is serious.
@AsherDavidson09 @midnight @JustinMcElroy @griffinmcelroy @ComedyCentral @TheDailyShow @iamjohnoliver That said, I'm sorry you thought we were seriously attacking millennials. We're not. We go after everyone playfully. It's not really...
@AsherDavidson09 @midnight Oh I don't take any of it seriously because it's a silly comedy show. Your reaction of taking YOURSELF so seriously validates some of it. ;)
@jenny_wade @cousino12 @nerdist Well you could make this one my birthday AND my xmas present??
@Rainearthimbue @midnight Points!
@jenny_wade @cousino12 @nerdist I thought that was part of our deal though???
@PitchAndDive @midnight In hindsight, thank you! ;)
@ShawnWildermuth like a 'lying down hug'? the kind married people do? OF COURSE!
@ShawnWildermuth Awwwww thank you Shawn. You're very sweet. Please give you wife a hug for me üòÅ
@ShawnWildermuth It's been on for a few months already and all the episodes are shot for the rest of the year (16). Sundays at 11p. Past eps on itunes.
@ShawnWildermuth Uh yeah...Lots and LOTS of things. The entirety of a story isn't just the tiny part you hear, my friend. :) YAY INTERNET AGE!!!!!!!!!
@SantiagovanVlix @telltalegames #brobrobro

@RowycoKustoms @midnight Ok points
@flakes_c @midnight Thank you for coming!
@BrewDude19 @papadiabolous @CarsonHull @midnight @travismcelroy @griffinmcelroy @JustinMcElroy ...dumbass thing you want! But then other people get to express themselves about what you said b/c they ALSO have free speech. Understand?
@BrewDude19 @papadiabolous @CarsonHull @JustinMcElroy Someone doesn't know how free speech works, huh? Free speech means the govt will not arrest you for expressing you opinion. Say whatever...
@ABakerN7 @midnight @thomaslennon @NikkiGlaser @NickSwardson Keep up the pleasant dreams!
The death throes of @midnight continue! Tonight the brilliant @thomaslennon @NikkiGlaser @NickSwardson say their goodbyes w/ wiener jokes!
@Brian_Eakins @midnight ok points!
@weedywet Fine. You're entitled to YOUR opinion but contrary to what you might believe it's not a universal. He mentioned it. Get over it.
@BrewDude19 @midnight @travismcelroy @griffinmcelroy @JustinMcElroy "You can laugh at things you don't agree with. It's called sophistication."  -Greg Proops
@weedywet Yeah people should only ever read things they're 100% going to agree with and never be challenged. Solid plan, guy. #AlgorithmGeneration
Hey! @RealRonHoward narrating Star Wars Arrested Development for @nerdist will start your day off in THE BEST way: https://t.co/KukDYVjPZ1
@SeeRedGo @midnight Heavens no! No matter what stay away from that news business. That shit is DEPRESSING!! I say My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic instead.
@shanecdotes_ @midnight @travismcelroy @griffinmcelroy @JustinMcElroy Oh no!!! The wound is still fresh on TFB!!! #Wipeout
@timmdkatrn Oh okay well when you're a guest judge you give it to whomever you like. #buddy
@CarolBlymire points!
Hey @midnight is leaving forever in 2 weeks so watch the show tonight maybe! See @travismcelroy @griffinmcelroy @JustinMcElroy &amp; ME.
@ND_Lynn65 @midnight #hugs
@ryan_a_jones Friday! It's almost always the Friday after the tv version airs.
@ecossefilmmaker @Eddie_At_Skaro Also, it warms my heart to have civil conversations on social media so thank you and have a lovely day!!! (3/2)
@ecossefilmmaker @Eddie_At_Skaro The new ones in because we're still attached to the old ones. But I believe the Doctor himself &amp; his ideals would appprove of this!! (2/2)
@ecossefilmmaker @Eddie_At_Skaro I think the beauty of the show (and subtext) is that things always change. Every time we get new characters it takes a beat to let (1/2)
@HungryHatter @Eddie_At_Skaro Yes! Thank you!! I wish more fans of things had your viewpoint. Judge solely based on someone's performance! AFTER you've seen it!
@real_timallen I actually couldn't see him from where I was standing. We were all in a straight line!
@Eddie_At_Skaro I have every excuse if one's ONLY gripe is gender. Yes. Yes I do. And I did!
@jbayha @DrawFour did!
@misslittle I'm shareable! ;)
@JSM_ATX @HallHLine Thank you! I admire your passion and hope you had a wonderful weekend!

@foofighterubu It's unedited ok iTunes or as a Nerdist podcast. I am who I am and talk how I talk! Not really sure that's a 12 yr old only thing.
@lelolai Points for the reference!
@JennyRenson Hope you had a great con! :)
@Grumpy_Oldmann @nerdist @NerdistMom I was! It smelled like Asgardian Spring
@vampire_xtine @nerdist Yes!!! Soon
@TheKennEdwards @talking They come out about a week after they air!
@RobertKirkman @talking ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@megaflyster yes it was quite an odd inclusion indeed. I guess the writer didn't feel much of a need to do any research? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@burgessm That explains a lot
@zakpenn Zak, thank you for my epitaph! Great meeting you and congratulations on the movie!!
Damon was a terrific guest. If you have time catch the @talking show at 11 on AMC or iTunes tomorrow. https://t.co/H2mGMJAwTY

@DrawFour @DoctorWho_BBCA If you didn't buy tix I'll make sure we give you some!
@SDclevergirl @nerdist Thank you!
@umlautilde @NBCTheWall "What number do you want to drop from?" "Why bother"
@DorkUnique Or did you just want to snap at someone without getting a response? ;)
@DorkUnique Not sure what panel you were at but I absolutely did. How much proof would you require? :)
@DrawFour @DoctorWho_BBCA I gave you a shout out on the panel!!! Thank you so much!!!
@NerdLadyAllie I did
Join us! I'm moderating! Room 24abc #SDCC17 https://t.co/brz6fnAqkw
@drsoos12 @KensArtisan Lemme know what you think
@lelolai Wonder no more. He doesn't! We were laughing after the panel.
@EnglishmanSDCC *hat tip* Hope you had a nice con!!
@Peter_the_Ellis @screenjunkies @midnight No shade at all! I sincerely loved it! And they were really great on the show.
@Cute_Data @number1met @midnight Points!
@SlyJanitor Thank you!
@1LaughingMan Bokay! Thanks for informing me!
@Mythicallaura @rhettmc @Joseph_Koivisto @nytimes @linklamont @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes I am also puzzled by my inclusion. I'm sober, married and work really hard. I'm enthusiastic but grown up, NOT in the troublemaker set.
@PattyMarvel It's @BlueStarDonuts!
@CantonDog Very close! "There is no artistry in perfection." But both work!
@apepelis @midnight Oh my FAVORITE! People see something once or twice and somehow turn it into EVERY episode. So great. Anyway this was fun.
@scorchingshark @midnight Lovely message! Thank you so much!!
@CovfefeTrump7 GOOD LUCK!!

@jakeduhjake @nerdist That was such a fun show!! Thanks for coming!
I'll be running around SDCC the next few days so here's where! Also flipping out that @nerdist is in Hall H today... https://t.co/f9Tq3V5xrD
@BoozyBadger @Serophous POINTS!!!

@tommy2824 @midnight @ComedyCentral Aw man! Here have some points!
@MCJonB @midnight Thank you!!! :)
@andrew_merica Haha I was about to call out @cnn for fake news but with @midnight going away they may actually be right! For now... &gt;:)
@Serophous @BoozyBadger @CarloCoyote no disrespect meant at all! Truly. But look our show is ending in 2 weeks anyway! So that's one less asshole on tv at night! :D
@shusune @BoozyBadger If you were actually watching, you'd notice we were poking fun at the bystander watching but we're not in an era of facts anymore. ;) #2017
@Serophous @BoozyBadger I've never said it's weird or bashed. It's playful! I make more jokes about the stuff I'm into so let's not all get dramatic. Friends? :)
@Syncos2 @midnight Thank you Mike
@JaredSchnabl @midnight @anthrocon Understood! We're cool!

My dear friend @maxbrooksauthor's new book "Minecraft: The Island" is out TODAY and you should get it because he's amazing.
@xtochie It is 100% not a spoiler. I'm not sure when he expected to find out but he's probably the last person on Earth who did. So it's all fine! :)
@xtochie What the hell??? It's been literally ALL OVER ENTERTAINMENT NEWS. I didn't break that story. BBC announced it in a big special SUNDAY. :/
@AndrewKruzel hehe nah I just like poking at hecklers is all. it's not for serious and it's cool with me that you hate my face. good night, sweetness! :)
OK WE CHECKED AND IT WAS LEFT IN SO YOU ACTUALLY WERE PROBABLY YELLING OVER ME SAYING IT LIKE I'M YELLING RIGHT NOW. #allcaps https://t.co/lalFa4nh1V
@AndrewKruzel Tell me about it! I wish YOU had a screen junkies group to make your bullshit enjoyable! Oh well. :)
I DID NOT. IT WAS A SEPARATE RANT THAT GOT CUT FOR TIME. I WILL POST THE CLIP AS SOON AS I CAN GET IT. https://t.co/lalFa4nh1V
@stargazer1682 I didn't. It was a separate rant they cut for time. TV shows are edited, you see...
You were all hilarious and fantastic! Thank you for Screen Junkie-ing @midnight! https://t.co/w7mM427wWN

@Dingodave67 I can't tell you actual numbers but I think there are more good people. The jerks DEFINITELY stand out though.
@FarberLee @phirm @_Brendonsmall Alas, the opera ran about as long as the movie did in theaters
@DinDizzy This inquiring mind wants to know why you haven't googled it since he has definitely been on ;)
@Twisphead Sure! I'll post something this week
@misscellophane That could totally happen IRL

@ManMadeMoon OHHHH LET'S MAKE A LOW BUDGE HORROR MOVIE
@DJBADDJ Bookmarked in yelp! Will def come back next time we're in town. Thanks!
@DJBADDJ Is that your place? We loved it!
@d_michas HAPPY BERFDAY!!! :D
@DubHeadGameWife Nice! The sweater is vintage and probably older than Alexis!
@ATTCares may I humbly request that you guys not screw my mom over? She had appt for a month, confirmed 2x, you didn't show and won't help.
@wiltwheel Uh not at all. Not sure I'm crazy about that question because it usually ends up with "why do you look like crap". ;)
@mrosenbaum711 @TheWallTF1 @thewall Thanks Michael!! It's a kick to the ol' heart nuts for sure...
@denizan22 @PokemonGoApp We shot that in November. Not all television is live. ;)
It's here! Our new @punyent animated kids' show @dangerandeggs on @amazon! Please watch it &amp; say nice things. https://t.co/bMz9XjBoQ7
@jamesleegilbert @Jeopardy @stephenfry @qikipedia I've been on! And I won! But it was 1996... https://t.co/NC5rs76B21
Is @Jeopardy on in the UK? And if so, is it our version? #RandomQs
@jessamack_ @nerdist It looks like this, but a little more gold and fuzzy in texture https://t.co/axWKrr72Ta
@GaragebandiOS Hey! Do you have ANY idea how to adjust portions of volume within a region? This crapbutt new version has moved that option.
@JaxonLewiz Eh we've been using GB since day 1 of the podcast but they just keep "improving" it.
Garage Band: Why would we change the interface just when you figured out the last one? Let's shake! Me: Ok! GB: TOO SLOW (changes interface)
@raspiras8 @welovefine Nope!
@welovefine ok what do I have to do to convince you to find one of these in my size https://t.co/aBQ6oDJ4fV
@celticorca @wilw good idea for next time!
@pacheco_kenny @midnight Uh...no.
@AnneWheaton @NBCTheWall consider them dropped!
@CBJ_Wookiee @Stranger_Things Appreciate that! It is a vintage sweater so that makes sense!
Hey! @NBCTheWall is on East Coast time! Watch that ball dropping madness!
@JSONDonnelly #TeamMystic
@bradsrehm @GeorgeTakei @neiltyson Hey hey points!!
Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow is out today on mobile!! I'm honored to be a head in a jar in game w/ @GeorgeTakei @neiltyson Stephen Hawking!
Because I'm all up in @nbc's mug tonight on @NBCGameNight &amp; then @NBCTheWall, I'm doing a FB Live chat at https://t.co/OX88l7ii01 at 1 PT! https://t.co/uilZyLFzKq
@ballsinplay @nerdist ALWAYS. The itch that never goes away.
@EOGamesInc_com @nerdist If you're a person launching something and not a massive corporation, @kt_money can add it to our community corkboard!
HAPPEE BERFDAY @MelBrooks!!! https://t.co/MojTS0VJGC
@lethomasjr Thanks!!
@kate_mccrea Ok! Happy bday!
@bbamok Oh no! Well send me the pic and I'll post it again and credit you! Sorry about that! It wasn't intentional.
@adamfgoldberg Ah crap! I knew it would go for more than estimated. The lot isn't up for a couple hours so it might go up even more.
@eric_england @edgarwright I never said what the movie was...üò¨ (no disrespect meant, I'd actually be interested to hear the process for a $50k movie)
This was so much fun! I met Luke Cage! And @janemarielynch is one of my favorite humans. https://t.co/YGNMQSjhxR
Fun week of bonus @nerdist podcasts! Mon: @edgarwright, Tues: Will Ferrell, Fri: Trey Parker #enjoyyourburrito
@jake_mcalvain @MeUndies Oh! HA! I just meant I bought some.
@Zakal @PozLang after the main stage from like 11-2am, but the Shoreline has a strict 11pm curfew. (2/2)
@Zakal @PozLang Oh and EDM and comedy have to either happen at different times or be MUCH further away from one another. Ideally, EDM would be (1/2)
@Zakal @PozLang Truthfully w/ 16 years of fest performance experience, removing the walls kills a comedy show. How bout BIGGER TENT! Next year! Thanks Zach!
@AngelaWheeless Good suggestions! We just had to do it once to figure out what people were into but we'll adjust accordingly for next year! Thanks so much!
@tresjoliaesthe Ha! I remember you! Thanks for coming! Love, Not Mark
@LilNinjaTaiger Ok so don't watch. It's your right as a consumer! Outside of that, I'm not really sure what I can do about it now...
@girltalk Sorry I missed you! We left right before the end to beat traffic but loved dancing on the stage! Thanks for doing it! #Shipmates
@natemartinsf We definitely need to figure out a better way to have all of it co-exist! We'll figure it out! Thanks man!! :)
@danharmon I love you, Dan Harmon!
@alcheyrep You're welcome. You gonna be okay? Or you just need to vent at me with sarcasm for a sec? Either way, thanks for watching!
@alucieer Thank you!
@ReflectivecogW @chrishardwick Slow your grrr dude. She always positions me exactly that same way so it's up to her.
@awalton @ID10Tfest Glad to hear that!! :)
@bigschembo üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
@mlfleisch @ID10Tfest I'm so glad you liked it!!
@JoaquinTall80 Firstieeeeeees
@jmkrisko üôåüèª
@T1nkC0nFaIrY @ID10Tfest Ok come to the back barrier at he comedy tent and I'll meet you there to sign your book
@humble_bones @ID10Tfest CHEESE SANDWICHES AND BUCKET SHITTERS FOR EVERYONE
@T1nkC0nFaIrY @ID10Tfest Shoot. Are you still around?
@dizneyjoy @VEGalleries I wasn't able to bid on this one because I'm working all day at my festival! I know I'm missing some good stuff!
@EmeraldCityChoc @AMCTalkingDead Ha! True
@CoolChemGal Haha sorry for the up-the-nose view! #boogs
@stitchvixen83 :)
@scottydilorenzo Thank you, Scott!
@kolbcm Hey no worries! It was cool if you to come back. Glad it worked out today!! :)
@philosophile Thank you! I have it right here!
@choptopmoseley @LydiaHearst @ID10Tfest @Weezer Yeah you were kind of a dick to me and @rainnwilson! Like you killed us and everything
@AnitaCoulter @ID10Tfest I agree! I'll try to find out why. It's hot outside!! Sorry about that! It could be a weird venue rule we didn't know about.
@stitchvixen83 I know! I'm so sorry! Whatever we couldn't fix today we will absolutely fix next year!
@AtomicAgeLoser Looping in @ID10Tfest to answer that! I'll also check on my end.
@hodgesart Thanks! See you next year!!
@FlyingTrilobite @ykarps @midnight Seconded! This month's theme: POINTS
@kat_films I was there not that long ago so it might not be until 2018! (if you mean Boston) Sorry about that!!
@ABranesample I appreciate you pointing that out though! I was able to fix that asap. Thanks!
@ABranesample @ID10Tfest You misunderstand...no one has to want in line for 3 hours. They just get a ticket &amp; return closer to showtime. I just clarified that! :)
You won't have to wait in line until the show once you have tix. Come back closer to your show time. The tix just guarantee a spot! (2/2)
Important note for comedy tent @ID10Tfest today: line up at 1:30 at the tent for tix for 4:30 show, and 2:30 for tix to 6:30 show (1 of 2)
@ABranesample @ID10Tfest What does exactly?
Also THANK YOU to everyone who came out yesterday! It was so beyond my wildest dreams &amp; hard not to feel joyfully emotional. See you today!
@cjmaravelias @midnight @talking Sleep? NEVARRRRRRRRR. And @1iota will hook up @midnight
@Ynigez @ID10Tfest Oh no! Happy to hook you up so you can come back tomorrow!
@THEjoeydavis @PoppySeedPlehzr Yeah you're right. Sorry about that! I'll see if we can do it for tomorrow but sorry it happened today!
@PozLang Bigger YES! We will. Removing the walls isn't great for the show just because it creates too much shuffling around.
@TaraBalle I performed in it too and agree! 1st day ya know ;) we'll fix it! Apologies!!!
@cosmonautDREW Tell me! The fire marshal forced the ticketing system last minute to control the numbers unfortunately. I am really sorry!
@kolbcm @ID10Tfest Just talked to producers. Fire Marshal forced us to do ticketing last min and cut number of seats. We're working on it. I'm genuinely sorry.
@kolbcm @ID10Tfest You know if you'd stop insulting me I'd try to figure out a way to make your experience better. Happy to give you your money back personally
Here's the line-up for @ID10Tfest this weekend at @ShorelineAmp! Tix at https://t.co/MUlPJQBf49. It's going to be amazing. JOIN. US. https://t.co/xYwDnfcuwc
Hey @midnight is off for 2 weeks! Have a pointsy 4th and we'll see you on 7/10!
@Jamesdeanvarner Bless you for this
Hey west coast! @NBCTheWall is on now! So, ya know, watch it.
Hey I'm on @JimmyKimmelLive tonight with this nice @AnthonyHopkins fellow! He is, quite literally, THE BEST. https://t.co/7ICHLppMzJ
Hey @RealRonHoward is directing @StarWars! They should call it Ron Solo. Or maybe that's Han's awkward brother who works in IT. #RonSolo
@paulandstorm @NBCTheWall Wait...so you HAVEN'T been?
Here's how @NBCTheWall works! Or you could watch it tonight when the new season premieres at 9/8c... #balls https://t.co/95LtpQEFL1
@LamontaeHoskins @NBCTheWall @KingJames Thank you!
@RecklessGamer88 @midnight I 100% said that but standards might have cut it out
@LaLondeJeremy Well now that makes sense
@Alonzo_Golden @MarvelStudios @chadwickboseman @Lupita_Nyongo @michaelb4jordan @DanaiGurira Agreed! The only bummer part is having to wait until 2018. I'm so excited to see it!
THIS WEEKEND #ID10TFest https://t.co/LhiVMSsKyO
@Forchy :D
Hey I'll direct the Han Solo movie! I have zero directing experience &amp; I'm VERY expensive. But I got TONS of Star Wars shirts! #StayOnTarget
@KenPlume I guess it could technically still be called Talking Dead? Just to stay on brand, you know.
@ShawnaKay2_14 @midnight Thanks! It's a company who takes dead stock fabric and makes a limited number of ties with them. That was 18 of 18!
@bradleyamyers @rubenblades @FearTWD @TheEmmys @WalkingDead_AMC AGREED 100%
@CHRISclassATF I gave it a shot!
@jandhobs @timminchin No no no. If that were the intent I'd have asked "Did you pull something pulling something?" Totally different. MY CONCERN IS REAL, JH
@phirm Hopefully the outer one too!
@jandhobs @timminchin Well thanks for the effort there. Did you pull anything? Are you okay??
IT'S HAPPENING https://t.co/UfUA2RlWqr
@Danielrockcity This is why their stocks are plummeting

@kuTTer_gaming zing!
Catch me with the #Futurama cast in a live streamed performance TOMORROW at 8pm PST right here on https://t.co/DrAUJ9qfhP #FuturamaLive
@yoda @Variety Damn! Good question! That's about a four hour answer I think.
Damn. 25 is a big number. Hey guys my career is a milliennial! It also has an ironic mustache and avoids eye contact. https://t.co/O3tOyam7ZF
@sidney9880 @Variety HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
@chironcentaur Nope! And it won't be called that.
@roybelly @TalkingDead_AMC @PatrickFabian Haha yeah spoiler everyone dies this episode
@iamerinnichol At least otters are COOL. I'd have been happy with that!
@KiyoshiParker Amen
@Jesse_McGuire High fives! Have a good night! :)
@Jesse_McGuire Also semantics, you're not using "semantics" properly there. It's about meaning not pronunciation ;)
@Jesse_McGuire Real life experience: he asked me personally to pronounce it the way I do but thanks :)
@wil17thril Ha! Did you make that? That's great
@Swolsie Haha maybe she needs glasses??
@KimAbridged @DionaReasonover @midnight Of course I noticed! She's hilarious!! And we will!
@neogreenlantern Never been in an attic, huh? ;)
And representing @CW_TheFlash! https://t.co/Fr0HX2IpjF
@jtalaiver @kumailn @emilyvgordon @nerdist It was a perfect Nerdist/Indoor Kids mashup!
@Miketok471 You got it! You don't need the booze. It's not going to make anything better at all. Then take the emotional win that you got through it! :)
@geekpinkhightop congratulations!!! :D
@Miketok471 My advice: JUST DON'T. And if it becomes too tempting, leave. Take a friend to get coffee or something. Stay strong man! You can do it! üí™üèª
Totally legit! https://t.co/e5xYFz0Rvo
@JacinB @NBCTheWall @AMCTalkingDead Thanks! :)
@rickygervais Whatever it is, please come on mine to promote it üò¨
@amygarcia @geoffkeighley @E3 Thank you for the kind and thoughtful input! Not everyone communicates on social media that way so I appreciate YOU! :)
@amygarcia @geoffkeighley @E3 I do TONS of these &amp; audience is usually one of the things I enjoy the most. It allows us to connect with people who took the time to attend
@amygarcia @geoffkeighley @E3 Audience questions are REALLY important because there are granular, more personal topics that the panel itself might not cover.
@TheNotoriousELB Portlandia? MST3k? Nerdist Podcast? Animaniacs? Weezer? Garfunkle &amp; Oates? Demetri Martin? Ok GO?
@DeannaRilling @marcellacomedy They were left over from the hit show MTV Crabz

@ijustine @neiltyson @JamesGunn @k_wolfkill @DuvalMagic Hey thanks! Nice seeing you there! Hope you have a great E3!!
@bobreinard I understand but it's all a learning experience. It's good to learn how to recover from crap like that that you can't control.
@PSangs16 @midnight One of my all time favorite guests on the show!!
@spartancsi Not bad! I like it.
I need to understand why I dreamt last night that I was wandering through a cave full of furniture with a Chinchilla named Butter
@bobreinard I don't think so!
@bismarchiavelli join us. joooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiin uuuuuuusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

@MarkBrehaut (I know I said that)
@JimKara2 ok thanks for the update
@DMJeske You'd have to call @alanalda and ask him to do it.
@DMJeske @alanalda I agree! It would be!
@JasonDStephens I'll heat up your meat real good!

@chelsea_davison Wait wait wait...what about Rupert...Rupert Pupkin!! Also works with Grint.
@chelsea_davison What about Fillory? Phil for short??
@chelsea_davison Maybe he's a Quentin or an Eliot? Or a Severus?
@emmafreud @RedNoseDayUSA Got it! Shooting all day! Will respond soon... :)
@bryce_risch @nerdist @nottjmiller No no no not YOU! You're #NiceBryce
@SnapTheJapanese @MagiciansSyfy @midnight @OliviaDudley @SummerBishil1 @hale_appleman They were fantastic! And lovely people as well!
Watch @MagiciansSyfy cast be hilarious on @midnight tonight AT MIDNIGHT https://t.co/1yTATBzqST @OliviaDudley @SummerBishil1 @hale_appleman
@emmafreud @RedNoseDayUSA I don't think I understood the gravity of the situation!
@FilthyDirtFox Of course! But it gets really tough to keep track of what's actually happening by the end. Great movie though!

@Thetruebrad CC discontinued the deal they had with them. None of their shows are on anymore, they're over at https://t.co/RLTFvtKpqh or the CC app
@netback @nerdist @AMC_TV Double up! The podcast  had more of the chat!!
ICYMI @waynecoyne of @theflaminglips is on the @nerdist podcast RIGHT NOW
@RealRonJeremy @Dantethecomic @LacomedyEnt Will do!
@RealRonJeremy Yes seriously! I will make it happen, my friend! DM some contact info and our folks will get into it tomorrow.
Ron, I'd like to personally invite you to come on our show! Wait...let me rephrase that... https://t.co/GMK0oPXNxX
@iamcorey1978 it is. see previous tweet

@sebastianbach @midnight @ComedyCentral Great job dude! It was a blast having you on!
@jakefogelnest @jonahray I know you did! But you're the only person I know who knows music stuff so I asked! Jonah forgets bands after other people hear of them!
@jonahray @jakefogelnest I know I know but he still knows music!
@ShawnGarrett @jonahray @jakefogelnest I haven't heard it recently. Just a song I can't get out of my head! If you heard even just the first few notes, you'd probably know it.
@jakefogelnest ok there's a song XMU plays sometimes. It's all piano, no vocals. Any idea what it is? Sorry I couldn't give you LESS info...
@fairpointpod Ok no worries man! Sorry to disappoint! But have a great day! :)
@LesserOf2Equals I don't! Sorry to disappoint!
@burkvest Actually the shirt said "Plinko &gt; The Wall" which is a BIGGER shot fired! Which I am fine with. I'm honored to even sort of appear on PIR!
@fairpointpod If you want to have the convo about why I approached it the way I did, that's fine! There are reasons. But please loosen the sharp tone. :)
@fairpointpod There are really bad things going on in the world that deserve your anger more, my friend. I guess you've been missing the news. Take care!
@fairpointpod We did, a little. But my feeling is that you can hear that in literally 10k other press junkets.
@elijahwood @nerdist Thank you! The second he sat down he wanted to get right into the big stuff!  It's fun when the folks you've never met exceed expectations.
@X_Factor65 :)
@X8Emily @wilw @midnight He's been on a ton and will be on again! Google it! He always kills ok the show.
@NerdistMom @Dodgers I did! I'll go back for sure.
@wilw @Dodgers wait...what has been called whozits now?
@wilw @Dodgers hmmm that doesn't sound right but whatever
@wilw @Dodgers Oh it's fine. Go to more games! I'll sure they'll put you on diamond board at some point.
@wilw @Dodgers Oh and correction...actually the FIRST time I was at a @dodgers game was 2012 when I threw out the first pitch. Doesn't everybody, though?? https://t.co/tWi0a96SSL
@wilw @Dodgers sooooooo that was a big deal then?
@jane2073 I'm honored!
@Jonny5658 Thanks!
@Roughriduz Well to be fair Comedy Central removed it from Hulu. Also, sorry! The shows are on the cc app or https://t.co/RLTFvtsO1H if that helps any!
@WargoBrian Thank you!
@stephkirchen @nbc @NerdistMom Thank you!!!
@DeborahForeman Also, seriously, how many times do people quote your Real Genius lines back at you??
@DeborahForeman hey my wife and I JUST watched April Fool's Day again the other night! Maybe this weekend will hit up Waxwork too.
@cfayard His producer asked me to come on and I said I would! So who knows? He was a solidly cool chap, that Bear.
@SteelRose75 Yeah. It was. That stage was like a slip n slide. Somehow I'm not tweaked today! Accidentally fun way to start the show though!
I'm Nearly Headless Wick! https://t.co/RG72Vnn3MB
@DrewMcWeeny Never fear mistakes, though! Often they can be the best part of a show because they're a unique, real experience you had with that audience.
@DrewMcWeeny I kind of wouldn't want to have started the show any other way. And luckily, no injuries!
@DrewMcWeeny @nbc @NerdistMom Thanks Drew! I was so careful during rehearsal so when the show started, I just ran out and my feet were up in the air before I knew it!
I did my best after it happened East Coast time to let you know 1) an accident occurred and 2) that I was okay! A nice lady caught my head. https://t.co/XByQNpDQpt
@dave_tvnyc @RedNoseDayUSA At this point it would feel weird to host something outside and have it NOT be raining!
Look I'm part of @nbc's fall lineup heyoooooooooo! I had an INCREDIBLE time hosting #RedNoseDay!!! (@NerdistMom I'm fine) https://t.co/KoW3gfCAvd
@ZephyrStone @nbc If you look closely some really nice audience member caught my head with both hands or it might not have gone too well!
@vinotamu I'm glad! It was an accidental but fun way to start the show.
@MsLauraQueen @nbc I was really tempted to run at a full slide but thought the better of it...
@JackNightmare3 Thank you!!!
@EnglishmanSDCC @SD_Comic_Con I'm doing a ton of panels at sdcc! I'm just not doing shows at night!!
@NickKitchens @CarsonDaly @RyanSeacrest ;)
@NickKitchens @CarsonDaly @RyanSeacrest Yeah mine. My generation has to listen to your generation bitch nonstop about the dumbest crap cuz you think everything has to be about you.
@ChrisWarcraft internally and externally!
#RedNoseDay! Tonight from 8-11 on @nbc! Watch me in the rain at 10! Because whenever I do a live broadcast outside I DEMAND it be raining! üî¥
@PaleZer0 @nerdist well it's not the most popular opinion but fighting should never be a first resort, IMO.
@MoonZappa heyyyyyyy! thanks for listening/watching that!
@thekevinryder @kroq Joqs when I was there: Boogerman (taught me the board), Tom Guide, Sluggo, Tami Heidi, Jed üêü, Kimmel, Carolla, Native Wayne, BLADE, Rodney
@kp3iron I enjoyed that chat! ME: kill em with kindness! BILL: kill em.
@daswickerman Points
@Omg_jess Well he's been on twice before, and it was Fassbender's first time so it skewed more towards him. I do the best I can with these ya know! :)
Hang out w/ Andrew Lincoln &amp; Keira Knightley for a "Love Actually" day in London! FOR CHARITY! https://t.co/U3zbyyaQJR #RedNoseDay
@Omg_jess I'm sorry! But I have no idea what you're talking about.
@witchywomin @paulandstorm I use short i. WHI-vern. But I'm sure @wilw will probably try to throw a soft g in there somewhere too. ;)
@ST_U2 I miss Minneapolis too! Especially now that the weather is getting warmer!

@LionsGuy1975 It didn't feel that way to me. But, you know, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Thanks for watching anyway!
@LionsGuy1975 Now please explain to me exactly what was in your head about how you expected me to respond to this. Seriously.
@MrDovahkiinSir @tatianamaslany I'm sorry I don't know! You'd have to google it!
@jdltr450 Thanks for your input and unsolicited judgment. I'll make sure an consult you on all future career decisions so you feel okay.
@cinderbella Sadly, he'll never do it. He's doesn't seem to enjoy doing press/chats/interviews.
@MrDovahkiinSir @tatianamaslany Yes! She was fantastic!
@Nicky_NormShine I would LOVE to!
@BrettGarwood @JennaMGarwood @Starbucks Will do! I will definitely be recharging on no foam, no water chai lattes all day!
@JoshPeckler @DanielMargolis I like both cities very much and hate all sports. Well, except for bowling. WHICH IS TOTALLY A SPORT. Good night gentlemen!
@DanielMargolis And now you know that @JoshPeckler is after your stuff so you have to keep an eye on him.
@DanielMargolis The highest of fives
@DanielMargolis Ohhhh I don't hate you!!! At all. I was hoping the ;) at the end would make it not so serious. We're good. All fine.
@DanielMargolis @jonahkeri I don't steal things from people. And CERTAINLY would I not do it to a friend of mine. A thievery accusation is hardly "love", my friend. ;)
@DanielMargolis @jonahkeri I can promise you 100% that it didn't come from that. It organically came out of the conversation in the 1st ep we shot so I kept doing it.
@DanielMargolis @jonahkeri I love Jonah but I have literally zero idea what you're talking about. So, ya know, pretty normal Internet exchange.
@PirateJenni13 Jenni, let's talk about you. When was your last eye exam? ;)
@ArthurHeath19 @idriselba @McConaughey @DarkTowerMovie I know I gotta. I tried! They weren't available.
Hey if you're going to @ID10Tfest in cosplay, tweet me a pic of you in said cosplay so I can post it alongside other attendees!
For your weekend podcast enjoyment: @nerdist podcasts w/ Danny McBride &amp; Michael Fassbender and the extended @talking w/ @JordanPeele! #hugs
@Dork_Power No, I have nothing to do with it. And they're not calling it that it turns out!
@SPeitsch It's actually going to Mountain View in Silicon Valley but I appreciate it!!
Hey! Come over to FB Live now why don't you? https://t.co/cogGHDay8w
@TxSonofLiberty I'll bet you're fun at parties.
@kylewsan79 Nope! I have nothing to do with it. They just "borrowed" our name.
@Mama_C_215 @midnight I dunno. He canceled. You'd have to ask him!
@mrchrishelms @MattMira I'm not gonna lie, it's a little strange. I'm all for more aftershows! They're great for fans! But....it doesn't make them look creative.
@mrchrishelms Nope!
YESSSSSSSSSSSS https://t.co/TFPG4dPKSU
@FlyingVGoddess @midnight Well hello! Have a nice day! :D
@FlyingVGoddess @midnight My thoughts are I'm tickled that people have been sending this to me for four years like they're the first ones to do it ;)
@Alexdrod Whachoo got?
@TerryGeil @midnight I remember that we've done 570 episodes and have always been open to non-comedians. No one ep represents ALL OF COMEDY. Nice try, kiddo!
@robfee CRAWL TO THE LIGHT! Shit these ghost babies don't know words yet.
@jeremyhoward Chumps have been sending me that bullcrap for years. I reject it.
@AlbasterDzaster üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Mr. @JordanPeele is an exceptional guest on @talking tonight at 11/10c on @AMC_TV!
@206geekTodd @nerdist But I'll tag @kt_money so she can make sure we pick it up in one of the upcoming eps
@206geekTodd @nerdist I'm guessing the reason is because we have thousands of requests besides just yours ;)
@Opolla Well you can watch the show that's on Sundays when WD isn't on! @talking, tonight, 11/10c on AMC
@stephanaghaagha Yeah that's what we all do. You sure got us there boy howdy. You're just too clever for our evil plans!!! ü§ñ
@mattdipanni NICE!
SURELY you'll let your dear husband borrow that sweet Sheikah Slate case, right? I'm pretty sure that was in our vows but don't check. https://t.co/kUQwRfItzz
@LadyCorax @StephenAtHome Well yeah cheesecake works. Any umbrage with a cracker crust is acceptable.
@LadyCorax @StephenAtHome No I'm sure it wasn't intentional. He's a brilliant super genius! There're only so many jokes so often it happens coincidentally. #NoUmbrage
It is very important to your happiness that you watch the instagram story by username: mphirm right now. cc: @phirm
@TheAdamWeston @DougBenson Not in the SLIGHTEST. I love that weed whacker!
@Sean_Gi You're not sorry at all or you wouldn't have said it. That's just something people say to justify not feeling guilty about being rude. ;)
@mycerebrallife I tried early on but failed. Gotta go back!
@ivanmario96 I did!
@dantelfer @Midnght @RonFunches @Yassir_Lester @SklarBrothers fucking agreed!
Watch our moms make inappropriate jokes on a Mother's Day ep of @midnght TONIGHT at midnight! @RonFunches @Yassir_Lester @SklarBrothers https://t.co/19oLtXyhJ9
@postalcowboy Thank you!
@Zoolander2301 NEVARRRRRRRRRR
@RobRoca25 So you just continue from your last save, right?
@ninafriel I did!
Soooooo I beat Calamity Ganon...now what?? I have 112/120 shrines. Do I complete them? What are you doing at this point? DLC? #ZeldaBotW
@finallydreaming Because he's never had time to! But I've tried. I've also tried to get him on @midnight. I'm a huge fan!
@jeaic2009 @midnight @Stixzadinia @Steel_Panther Not at all. The FCC doesn't oversee paid cable tv. All standards are self imposed by cable networks for advertisers.
@galaxyclue You too!
@galaxyclue I don't hate you at all! We are okay :)
@galaxyclue And lastly, respectfully, it's not your job to control my personality to your specifications. THAT is also narcissistic. FYI. #hugs
@galaxyclue Our show is a playground for ALL OF US, including me. Sometimes I will rant if I feel passionately about something and that's okay.
@galaxyclue "I'm going to force my unsolicited opinion on you and if you don't agree well then YOU ARE BROKEN." Sound familiar?
@galaxyclue @midnight But that's how the Internet works now! :D
@galaxyclue @midnight What worries me is that your thinking your opinion is law and that I'm flawed if I don't listen to you is, in fact, narcissism. ;)
@cowboychris66 üôåüèª thanks!
@cowboychris66 If you don't like that one we have 570 other panels for you not to complain about.
@JosephGNevin I know this auction! Mike emailed me about this lot but I haven't had time to go see it yet. That map might be out of my range by a bit. ;)
@galaxyclue @midnight So in other words you want me to shut up and get out of your way. BUT NO OFFENSE. ;)
@galaxyclue @midnight Yeah. It was very necessary for me or I wouldn't have done it. Thanks.
@Bhess But the point of people creating their own demons to fight?? COME ON. Are you that enlightened that you haven't done this?? I dunno...
@Bhess I adored talking with him. Much of it applies to stuff I'm experiencing in my life, and I guess those issues haven't or won't affect you.
@Bhess Why say that at all if you're sorry to say it? If I'm truly sorry to say something negative I ask myself what good it will do. So why do it?
@kriswernowsky @AshleyEsqueda @DrewMcWeeny FZzzzzzzzzzzzzzRrrrrrrguh wut. WUT. WHO'S THERE??? Eleanor? Is that you?
@kriswernowsky @AshleyEsqueda @DrewMcWeeny Can I make an elaborate vertical habitrail hideout in his sinus cavity &amp; call it "Nosevelt"? Also can I apologize for that joke immediately?
@AshleyEsqueda @DrewMcWeeny Am I the unkillable supervillain??? Because that would be AMAZING.
Guy Ritchie is a superb guest on the @nerdist podcast today! https://t.co/1IaEK69ByP
@elgolfo Thank you!!
@EnriqueEstorga he hates doing that stuff! HATES it.
@philchadwick I'm just so passionate about bulk powder tankers. Also, kudos for having the goto last name that people assign me when they mess up mine! :D
@maybby57 OH WOW AMAZING
@JediBabs @talking Thank YOU!
Join me! https://t.co/u54QpDPyPN
I wonder if @simonpegg remembers this https://t.co/trbS0OpTfC
@zany_1965 THANK YOU
Can I get a trophy or something for my MC Hammer moves? #NBCTheWall
I absolutely love that we had a Homey the Clown question on @NBCTheWall
Hey @NBCTheWall is showing a new episode in a few min after @NBCTheVoice (10/9c)! Watch them balls drop!
Less than 24 hours left to bid for Talking Dead tix w/ $ going to Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society LA! https://t.co/1XM91FYtad
@caitlinjgallo @InvestigationD5 RIGHT?!
@bazqwerts @JKCorden Thanks!!
@locobearsfan @MTV I mean listen, four shows isn't enough for the good folks at @mtv. I guess we had a bad breakup in the 1900s? ;)
@Ensign_Paul Professionally framed with non reflective museum glass!
@W3BGUY @midnight Aw that's first season material!
Charlie Hunnam is on @talking at 11/10c on @AMC_TV TONIGHT!!! You will enjoy him. https://t.co/dCeX8obmcL
@FanTheoryWorld Thank YOU and congratulations!
@Rickypeacock277 AGREED but I'm not sure BKV will ever allow it...
@Mow_Mauf @nerdist yes! usually they'll be bonus episodes a few days after the tv version airs.
@Davestewstew I really liked it! I'm not sure why it didn't do better but I thought it was a fun movie.
@trujillob10 @midnight @RollingStone Eh I never make those lists. OMG MAYBE THAT'S A SIGN. I better quit everything! Thank you, @RollingStone!!!
@MichaelBock1980 We actually had that joke in there but we cut it out for time. Most television gets edited, you see...
@ikatsume @jwcounts @Catbunny What town?? Where??
@michael0deon Thanks! üòÅ
@michael0deon This winky fella does not mean cross ;)
@jwcounts @Catbunny I was only able to kill one of those white ones with a libel bow and bomb arrows from FAR away
@michael0deon I love that you assumed I didn't google it first based on nothing ;)
@CatchAndSync I did and didn't find the answer.
Zelda BotW players, which Lynels drop guts? I've taken out a few and so far only horns. Gotta upgrade armor before Calamity Ganon fight!
If you're in the Bay Area stop in to your local comic shop and win tix to @ID10Tfest! #FREECOMICBOOKDAY https://t.co/2GCPfC0Yxl
What's a good comic book you'd like to see as a tv series?
@DeuceGort @nerdist Nice! Okay thanks and have a good night! :)
@DeuceGort @nerdist Don't feel bad. It's fine. You weren't mean about it at least. Thanks for liking most of the show ;)
@DeuceGort @nerdist The regular episode will be back next week. I was very sick last week and couldn't record one. Sorry.
@DeuceGort @nerdist I do the best I can putting out stuff every week so when people knock it down because they want a different free thing, it's disheartening.
@DeuceGort @nerdist Totally your right to not like it but I wouldn't have gotten James on otherwise and he was really great.
@DeuceGort @nerdist If you don't like something you haven't even listened to, fine, skip it. But why tell me? I mean who wins in that situation?
@Lazy_Eye_Acid For the love of...IT'S ONE WEEK WHERE I GOT SICK AND TOO BUSY. Why is this such a problem?
@DeuceGort @nerdist It just kinda comes off like "Hey! That free thing you work hard on? I don't like THAT kinda free thing. Gimme that other free thing! Now!"
@DeuceGort @nerdist Also I'm willing to bet you're not that sorry to say it or you wouldn't have. ;)
@DeuceGort @nerdist Why? They're exactly like the live shows. Are you honestly THAT picky? It's still a long chat with a great guest!
@ballzygonads @NBCTheWall @NBCTheVoice Doubtful! NBC owns a piece of Hulu.
Bid on 2 tix to @AMCTalkingDead with all of the money going to charity!!! https://t.co/1XM91FYtad
The next couple Mondays @NBCTheWall will show sneak peek NEW episodes from our new season right after @NBCTheVoice! So, ya know, watch it.
@DecafKauffee @midnight that's true
@JaredSchnabl @midnight Definitely take a comedy show seriously, that's what I always say
Such a fun Star Wars Day ep of @midnight tonight. We'll actually be on AT MIDNIGHT!! Crazy! https://t.co/MsdDv48oOh
@BurtDellinger @midnight Is that the medication that the doctor also prescribes a pound of Cool Ranch Doritos to go along with it?
@BurtDellinger @midnight Time to get that eye prescription strengthened
@adam_comic Yeah that does deserve points. Starring Hairy Manderson!
When I used Gern Blanston on @CriticalRole I was making a @SteveMartinToGo reference from "Comedy Is Not Pretty" -&gt; https://t.co/iasubMVASc https://t.co/Bsp4debchR
@Saxm13 @nerdist @brielarson Look, Animal Crossing is life. What more is there to know???
@Laurajo1959 Neat! What was the quote?
@ErikJRocha @andysignore @midnight @screenjunkies Uh...heh? I don't entirely know what you're talking about but if you want to do the show that's fine by me!
@fxl NO FUCK BOOKS!!! PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEEEEEEEE
@jessicaalba @midnight I told you &amp; @CashWarren I was going to say hi! :D
@Apey  https://t.co/U0AKmPXdQm
HAPPY BERFDAY @APEY. You missed your namesake month by a day.
@DarTheBucsFan Just the taping not the air day
@monsterzro_nyc Naw I don't think so
@Hank_Diggs @talking Well yeah he's CRAIG
@shazapp That's fantastic
@joeypadron @talking @JKCorden Thank you!
@ChrisHayner Heh heh it's not!
Watch @talking tonight! My guest is @JKCorden and you will love him more. 11/10c on @AMC_TV! https://t.co/RKvA0q5B2A
@NerdistMom I have! A couple of times. Google really works ;)
Thanks to @brianmonarch who gave me matzo ball soup @TheComedyStore cuz I wasn't feelin' great. Also, fun show!! https://t.co/ogSd5H2atB
@BillSchulz "I feel like" whatever I'm doing is working pretty well, Bill! So maybe I don't gotta. Hey maybe YOU should feel like more things. ;)
@Heatherrfmoore @midnight I'm sorry but what are you talking about?
I made a music/comedy/comic con festival thingie! Come to it! June 24 &amp; 25 in Northern California! Git yer tix at https://t.co/MUlPJQBf49 https://t.co/qUnvbe1afo
@RandyBReyes We've been doing casual Thursdays!
@TheRealBrittman it was trending! that's how I found out
@PandaGravy @NerdistPodcast Damn straight!
Sweet sweet @nbcagt guest judge action https://t.co/6JzSl5UOtM
@WKRPinCanada I HAVE GRAPH PAPER AND A RAPIDOGRAPH DON'T MAKE ME USE THEM
@WKRPinCanada You're always free to unfollow this food truck if you don't like the sandwiches it makes. CUZ THEY AIN'T CHANGIN'
@WKRPinCanada Don't make me shame you with a stat graph and the disparity between jokes about sports obsession vs. sports itself. ;)
@WKRPinCanada I guarantee you it still PALES in comparison for how much I have to hear about that shit. Pales. There are more POVs than just yours dude.
@WKRPinCanada I love that all day every day people yak sports ad nauseum and the HANDFUL of times someone pushes back a little, IT'S TOO MUCH. Rad. ;)
@WKRPinCanada Is it older than having to hear about fucking sports all the fucking time? Because I guarantee I'm WAY more tired of that than you are of me
@Kersimus @midnight Thursdays for now
Tonight! @midnight as @moshekasher @Jokoy &amp; @Char_mck! Join us AT MIDNIGHT for 100% GOOD TIMES
@LDYRAR87 @midnight @moshekasher @Jokoy @Char_mck you are correct! I messed up.
CORRECTION!!! @midnight is tonight at MIDNIGHT! Following @TonyAtamanuik's brand new The President Show!! I made a boo boo.
Hot crumbs! It's Sportsball Sorting Hat Day!!! I hope your preferred footballing squad acquires that guy you like.
The full chat w/ @JKCorden is Sunday night, 11p on @talking on @AMC_TV! #FullFrontal https://t.co/Vt7Psb1IE4
@jamesmagnus eaaaaaaasssssssssy there
@dbkimbro @jonahray @nerdist neer neer neer neer neer BERRRRRRRrrrrrrrr
@jonahray @nerdist well, yeah.
@beatsarebroken @nerdist @depechemode I hope he comes back on again at some point. I could have talked to him for hours! Solidly cool chap.
@jamesmagnus I'm glad you liked it!! He was really cool.
@missionmb @nerdist @depechemode I'm so glad you dug it!!!
Folks, I'm not gonna lie...Dave Gahan of @depechemode is one of my favorite @nerdist podcast guests EVER: https://t.co/jflXYOhWqy
@keithzd double points!
@keithzd I loved that! Thank you!
@SansKern Now that's a good challenge that would annoy everyone but WORTH IT
@idiot_girl @mholland85 @midnight @mrmattwalsh @timothycsimons Points!
@damianholbrook Honestly, even if you had said, "that Chris Hardwick is a sack of CRAP!!!" I'd have been like, "HEYYY!!! I'm in TV GUIDE!!!" :D
@damianholbrook Ha! I took it as a tongue-in-cheeky compliment! So thank you! :)
@damianholbrook What was it?? What'd I do?
@rclichter it almost happened but we couldn't get them all here to LA on a tape day with their schedule.
@michaelbyers @talking Thank you, Michael!!
@EllisMarkC Just start at ep 1 and roll through it!
@WillDriver93 @midnight Thanks, Will!
@WillDriver93 @da_nibbler @AMC_TV As far as I know, @talking is not in the UK and that SUCKS. I really want shows on there so I can come do stand-up and have people show up.
@Quiqoman yeah our writing staff did one of these and I gotta say...I'm kind of a hot lady
@OliviaDudley @hale_appleman Indeed! In that case we MUST do a @MagiciansSyfy panel and theme the episode around your show. We just need a third panelist!
SCIENCE!!! Hey @ThomasDolby remember when I marched into your house and boat studio in 2011?? https://t.co/3XOjz116db #marchforscience
@PhatteningPhilm it might be "maintenance". or "expansion".
Come to the show and bring some Q's for potential A's! https://t.co/CQybwzUXXn
I'm a cowboy. Furthermore, on a steel horse I ride. @ComedyCentral posted my Bon Jovi cover w @TheRealSambora: https://t.co/Ev5xt2T8cB #hair
@calichk77 @hale_appleman @shadipetosky @LydiaHearst @MagiciansSyfy @midnight @talking  I tried!
@hale_appleman @shadipetosky @LydiaHearst @MagiciansSyfy Hale, you should 100% come on @midnight
@hodgesart @midnight That's not true. I think it may have been within the first month. #FATHERRRRRRRRRRR
Mah wife @LydiaHearst saw @OliviaDudley at a party but was too nervous to tell her we're fans of @MagiciansSyfy. I'm outta town but HI ALICE
@_katadams @bigangrylaw OBJECTION!! (But thanks for being cool!)
@redban of course!!
Hey Austin, TX! I'm performing @MoontowerComedy tonight at the Paramount Theater at 7p! Come to that!
@djwtwo somehow you must find the strength to go on!
@ARDavidson79 they actually asked me to do it for that episode (truth) but I couldn't
@seankeane @marcellacomedy @midnight well she is!!!
@shinyfailure you certainly can!
@jimmybellamy Points!
@McLeprekraut I don't think I've said any of those names out loud in over a decade!
Incredible addition to @talking guests: the cast of @OITNB! Show tapes May 4th and tix are FREE! Bring your fandom! https://t.co/Fy3UUQu1qn
@MrSimonTaylor The Chronicles of Gern!
The @nerdist podcast today is @doree &amp; her husband @MattMira! Her book "Startup" is out next week! Also, IVF stories! And best ending ever.
@AnnaP53 @talking Ok! @1iota will help! Hope you feel better!!
@Advil ROCKETSHIP!!! Thanks for playing along man! And for listening to the podcast! Also, key snag on the username! üëçüèªüëçüèª
@dkordecay he had to cancel because of his work schedule
@erinjax @midnight :)
Hey if you'd like to be in the audience for @talking taping Thurs w/ @JordanPeele here's the link! Tix are FREE! https://t.co/fnuWEzZs8q
@wilw YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Very excited to add @janemarielynch to the upcoming guest roster on @talking!!! Next Sunday at 11/10c is Michelle @realmonaghan!
@AbbyZavos @nerdist haha I won't
@ThePerezHilton @midnight points!!
We're BACK on @midnight tonight! And @talking is on Sundays! That's FIVE whole nights a week of my pasty mug! https://t.co/CbvHIlDtmp
@Bahstine @talking oh no! were they on the coffee table???
@Bahstine @talking My coffee table my rules!! ;) #FeetsUp
@AndrewMcLemore1 solid plan!
@ArthurAllblack Dunmer named Jiene Wyldre (Gene Wilder)
@cmsquareds Thanks, Chris!
The boys of @SiliconHBO on our 2nd ep of @talking tonight at 11/10c on @AMC_TV! https://t.co/xY4BvXtdbZ @Middleditch @MartinStarr Zach Woods
@HamiltonPrime oh you got that snazzy armor!! I still need to complete the main quest for that.
@stokd high fives my friend!
@stokd @nerdist @talking @elijahwood What? No! How did you arrive at that assumption? They're just bonus episodes!
@gmanfan no I'm at work! All weekend!
@bingy_wingy love it! Thanks!
@Shawnforward13 we can't because that immediately dates all the shows and gives them an expiration date. BUT there's always @nerdist news!
@GJSwartz what's up is that I did an entire podcast with him about a few months ago :)
@WhoaOhRae thanks!
@medjesky both of your losses. Our wedding was fucking FANTASTIC. 10 min ceremony. Then dance party w/ zombies and droids.
@gabgabgarcia but if you're getting really granular, there's no "need" for ANYTHING on tv really. It's just fun entertainment. :)
@gabgabgarcia eh...yeah. We used to post 3 podcast eps a week. This allows to go back up to 2. And it's video. Complementary, not redundant.
@bobr2d2 @ThatKevinSmith @ATRietsch I know right? I have a vintage French Tron poster and it's real close! Movie still looks cool as shit though.
If you missed @talking premiere or don't have @AMC_TV IT'S ON THE @ITUNES https://t.co/vgDXfUzyGZ. We air Sun, it posts Mon #TalkingHardwick
@gerrymercer thank you Gerry!
HI @MST3K is on @netflix TODAY! I'm so proud of @jonahray. 1st ep has 1 of the BEST bits in MST history (song by @paulandstorm). #Reptilicus
@zebrahdh now that's just a fun sentence for multiple reasons
@Pat_JG @talking Ok I'll throw in that li'l reference on one of the upcoming eps!
@dylane9735 @MTV I mean LOOK @MTV broke up years ago and it hasn't recovered fully. (at least according to its ratings) HEYOOOOOOOOOOOO #SingledOut4Life
Hey HEY! Bonus @nerdist podcast today is unedited audio of 1st @talking ep w/ @elijahwood! Make sense? ME TOO. Hear: https://t.co/WuC1N1yidn
@lovinchico09 apparently impossible!
@K72heart let's leave the NES out of this!! It's an innocent bystander!! :)
@msw117r22 oh did they not air it?
@tyblinger oh yeah! I remember that now!!
@Nikki_0715 oh wait Nikki...WHO GOT CHEERS???
@tyblinger I dunno! Where and what is that?
@Nikki_0715 haha what magazine is that?? I might have to frame getting jeeers-ed.
@LogrusZed fair points
@LogrusZed fair point
@leverus @alonsomyers @MagiciansSyfy my wife @LydiaHearst &amp; I love the show almost sexually. Nice work!!
@tobyherman27 @NBCTheWall @TheEllenShow I miss your 90s band Toby! Tobi! Tobee!
In between @NBCTheWall tapings...about to go do @TheEllenShow for the 1st time. I'm kinda nervous! She's a comedy goddess! #deepbreaths
@HlywdStacy Breaking Bad for me...I was locked in ep 1 minute 1! See you at @ID10Tfest!! :)
@HlywdStacy @MagiciansSyfy Thank you! :) Remember that it took Buffy a season to lock in, though. Experientially I think the analogy is fair: this generation's Buffy.
@LARKtheARTIST But I DO I think she's one of the funniest people we've ever had on the show! Truly brilliant comedy mind. 0 replies 0 retweets 1 like
@HlywdStacy @MagiciansSyfy The humor, self awareness, references, the musical stuff--yeah, it is. Careful not to fall into "only stuff I saw as a kid is good" ;)
@elimental_merc @MagiciansSyfy Just get through season 1. Season 2 is worth it.
@LARKtheARTIST She wasn't "robbed". The other 2 buzzed in REALLY fast on the speed games and pulled ahead. I know. I was there for the whole unedited show.
I say this as a huge compliment: @MagiciansSyfy is the new Buffy
@LandenSanteramo the app in question is the phone's native phone app. It's saying I have a missed call or voicemail that I don't have.
@GaymerQueen I salute your patience!! I'm sure people are not their nicest when calling...
There is a phantom "1" on my Phone app and I need to dig it out with a spoon
My pal @ynb is hosting @CosplayMelee on @Syfy tonight! https://t.co/J6Ekbb0zIX

@dodgerfan1384 thanks Geoff!
@joeypadron thanks Joey!
@Maddox_32 :)
@Dorianwallace i mean who would say no to cookies??
@LukeSoroko the latter!
@PregnancyNewsMD you'd think swears were acceptable at this point! Sadly, no. F*****************CK
@Ender_worsham we should! Or a letter jacket. But seriously, my condolences and hugs to you Andrew.
@wolfc312 fwiw that's an awful thing to say to someone :)
@Jimmythehat1 @talking @AMC_TV @nerdist no, they're fan reactions/questions. And thank you!
@hambamjam say that's not very nice. We've never even met! :)
In 30 min @talking w/ ME premieres on @AMC_TV on the East Coast &amp; Central Time Zones. Please give it a shot! :D
@kpratt1973 nah I thought it was best to use the existing feed to let as many people know about it as possible
@kpratt1973 Nerdist! Old podcast
@sophomohric @midnight @Simpsons_tweets I'll end each episode with "you can really taste the goat"
@phoenixalpha @Po10472 HAPPY BIRTHDAY PAULINE!!! Have a wonderful day!
I love this pic w/ @elijahwood! Zoom into @adamjoseph86's shirt in the bg. @talking premieres tonight at 11 on @AMC! https://t.co/Xywtv46OrM
@bonehead237 I gotta give you points for not going for the obvious one!!
@doublerq thanks for coming! I hope you had fun!!!
@TFacente I need a good 70s skinny microphone!
@LunaSerenade @midnight I'm sure @1iota can help out with that!
@mmeller we'll do that on the new show I promise!!
@pwSociety ok I'll host that
@ThatRobDavidson that's EXACTLY what it means!
@marginal_error alllllllllmost üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥
@_cneurohr aw is that supposed to be an insult? That's adorable!! Keep at it, tiger. You'll get it right!! #hugs
@chxngao @midnight The audience picks. I don't pick.
It's true! I do! :D https://t.co/CILL0Vqs50
@tabbiewolf @midnight ah crap sorry! Ok good idea!
@AwesomeRoxyFree oh cool! I'll give it a listen! Thanks!

@PettySwap @katelynnacon Thank you but with all due respect, you don't know actually know me. Listen to my podcast and then get back to me on that *fail*. :)
@ShaftBoogie Yeah I have the armor and I stay crouched but he always spots me out of the log or when the wolf jumps out :/
@sss328 @TheSoup @midnight glad you had fun!! :)
@elpez3 unequipped!
@elpez3 both
I've played the Lost Pilgrimage quest 15 times so far and failed every time. I'm about to hit Oaki with a fire arrow. #ZeldaProbs
@sss328 @TheSoup @midnight heyOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@SarahKei12 that's hilarious! who made that??
@1iotaSupport @chris_hawk I bet we can do it now. :) Please make it happen.
@mediavandal "Calamity Brandon"...am I supposed to shoot you in the eye with an ancient arrow???

Bringing science to primetime! We're still in development @nbc but I'm very proud of this. https://t.co/AaZOrKvmbt
@darian_beharry haven't tried it yet!
@Steveharwell @midnight Steve, you're a good man! Thanks for playing along with us! We actually met several years ago at KROQ. You were nice then too! :)
@LydiaHearst hey why not there's nothing wrong with a little ass now and then heeHAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWpleasedontleaveme
@sweetgrlychck @AMCTalkingDead I did, in fact, mention Jadis and Rick. I guess "what the hell" is now back in your court. :)
@wilw Actually I got that wrong...my diddlecock is fine but I'm very concerned about my poppycrumbs! You better get over here immediat
@ManMadeMoon TWO DIVINE BEASTS DOWN #ZeldaBotW
@wilw Poppycock! Hogwash! Diddlecrumbs! H-why I'm as negative as a male pregnancy test I tells ya! #hrmph
@triciagardiner @AMCTalkingDead @WalkingDead_AMC HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUR SON!!! üéÇüéâüéÅ
@GuanoLad @PasteMagazine @talking @neiltyson the hell are you talking about?
@ManMadeMoon I hear ya! I just can't believe Zelda turns out to be a sled
@das_gras @16 That hurt my soul. I would have thought at least ONE person?!!
@ManMadeMoon I'm glad we're discussing that it's in the room. Just got through that this morning! I recommend stocking up on bomb arrows for boss battle.
@BobbiJo88 possibly but I don't know who it is yet. I won't know until Sunday!
@ManMadeMoon How far are you?
Your ability to juggle immersive games is impressive! I can only handle one at a time! #HylianLife https://t.co/Bk94UgCuTS
@MichaelChiklis @midnight @nerdist POINTS CHIKLIS!
@RealDougPryor That is actually a fantastic idea! But we're pre-taping them to fit in the schedule!
@CallerJen @BlueStarDonuts THE. BEST.
@clydetombaugh Join us in videogame land!!! It's nice! And distracting!!! :D
@wilw that drive sounds like anything but straight HEYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@DuvalMagic I got it finally! My problem was not finding a flat surface to summon on
that did it! thanks!!! Now to see what the Guardian amiibo brought to my life. https://t.co/nPGtycLDf4
@Mray901 tapping there and nothing happens
Anyone having trouble getting Switch to recognize amiibo in Zelda? I have amiibo rune turned on &amp; activated but tapping joycon does NOTHING
@SluggoDoug I GOT NAMECHECKED! I've always loved your work dating back to KROQ when I unsuccessfully tried to run the board as fast as you
@leftygoleft yes! which means you can only redeem them using a series of very difficult parameters and circumstances.
@Jjaybles a shirt mule would charge at least DOUBLE that
@leftygoleft hahahaha
@salFreeApps non-reflective museum glass
@ScottSkiba comedy. It's not serious. But hey maybe a comedy banner isn't for everyone, Scott! ;)
@Bat_Man_10_11 I am definitely NOT a licensed minister. Not sure where that idea came from?
@leftygoleft great pic! it's adorable that you think jeopardy invented that concept. ;)
@nerdist Elon Mush huh? Did he found Space Eggs? And Messla?
Our annual @midnight Tournament of Champions starts tonight w/ @moshekasher @mametown &amp; @RonFunches! Each night's winners will compete Thurs
@Ultimatej142 already got it! thanks! Bomb arrows to the eye FTW
@DrawFour @midnight I'll wear it the next time Jonah is on! I'll find out the date. Thank you! It's amazing.
@Bahstan nice!!
@stmedlock7 what's dm?
@KatKeg that was just you :)
@CameronThePuma I'm fine! I dunno. Just wasn't bouncing off the walls is all. Thanks for your concern!
Do you sell gems and luminous stones? Or is there a gear-crafting situation I should be saving them for? #ZeldaBotW
YOU ARE THE BEST RICHIE! Thank you!! And while my wick may be hard, sadly it is not a horse made of steel. Can I still be a cooowboyyyy-ah?? https://t.co/bLItJeCcRY
@wilw Now I'm sorry I didn't see this last night
@ParisLay a shop in Hateno Village I believe!
I found of these orange metal activator balls in the wild after killing a giant. What do I do with it?? #ZeldaBotW https://t.co/HQugHYhSCo
@GarretHeinrich @BrianDKarr it is very appropriate
So the blood moon is pretty much every fuggin night at this point. I see how it is, Zelda.
More Zelda questions! If you leave a registered horse out in the wild does it return to the stable by itself?
@heathercampbell I hear tell that you need a lot of hearts for a special thing later in the game
@dantelfer also, do your registered horses return to the stable if you leave them out in the wild?
@dantelfer what??
Ok Zelda BotW question: I have 5 hearts &amp; an upgrade coming. Do I go heart or stamina? Haven't upgraded the latter yet.
OMG @HamillHimself! How did I NEVER know you were Corey?? I'm getting a cel from this now. https://t.co/VyTyVIDWcT #YabbleDabble
@leowraith76 ironically we found that wig growing on a fence.
@wiggling1620 yeah. really. sometimes we fuck with words for emphasis. you gonna be okay? cuz there's NOTHING else going on in the world. ;)
@library_vixen nope! it's @TheMikeLawrence
@meganpeterscb @ComicBook thank you for correcting!!! legions of animation nerds greatly appreciate it!!! :)
@slightlykatie @sarahpreyes93 this is the first I'm hearing of this but I'm glad you let me know. That won't happen again and I'm sorry!!!
@sarahpreyes93 I also promise this kind of question engineering will never happen again!!!
@sarahpreyes93 I don't know who told you your question was too obscure but they're about to get a talking to. My deepest apologies!!!
@meganpeterscb https://t.co/ANn6UOi3fE
@meganpeterscb in the interest of truth in journalism would you please amend? This is sadly how misinformation germinates. Have a great day!
@meganpeterscb hey Megan! I tweeted @ComicBook to no avail. Friendly FYI: Bob Camp is NOT the creator of Ren &amp; Stimpy. It's @JohnKricfalusi1
@AnnaP53 @talking ok sure! @1iota can help set that up!
@ChloeKFlores the helmet is amazing!
@ThUrbanNinja @HyperTigerXT i gargled a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar
@micfriel so Dax Shepard then?
@rioswilli well yeah because I'm a cowboy.
Hey @ComicBook! Just a friendly correction...Bob Camp did not create Ren Stimpy. @JohnKricfalusi1 did. Please amend! https://t.co/ZJQuSZlnru
@silverandgreen @1iota of course you are!
@Kurdtlhorg my main question about that show is "what at all is happening".
@allexdaniels @GregProops @midnight I loved the jacket! Douglas Adams is a GOOD thing.
@RandyBReyes while not technically pajama jeans, they were pajama worthy!
@grlwholvd @kyleclarkisrad @midnight he was not!
@TheIBang Thank you!!!
@Heart_Songs_ you must have dreamt that! ;)

JUST ADDED to @ID10Tfest for 6/24, @TankandDaBangas! Their @NPR set was legendary: https://t.co/ggtO4eMB9b Tix at https://t.co/MUlPJQBf49
I would LOVE to have @rosariodawson either on the podcast or the new @talking show! https://t.co/7AJrrPtSzu
@dave_koons he's the second most used behind Daryl. Ok not to like him, but what ACTUALLY makes one look like a fool is false fact-using. :)
@JasonXtron I never said he went forward with the almanac. How much of the films do you want me to recite? :)
@StoneColdMAustn HAPPY BIRTHDAY MATT!!!
@TeriSpears @ComedyCentral @midnight Thank you, Teri!!! :)
@Shawna https://t.co/mAE5m8Bw7w
@119paulie he ended up being fine! It was a one time thing.
@Evil_Asshole I know right?!! What a tool I am!!!
@Shawna a reasonable concern! In my defense, free time is my sworn enemy. Look, just 45 more years and I PROMISE I'll retire!! Sound ok?
@Seanatonin I have that shirt!
Ok now the @midnight @instagram account has been hacked. What a fun day!!! #sharts
Someone hacked the @midnight account. You may ignore anything that it says until further notice. Maybe we turn it into a game on the show? https://t.co/OjfFZohMVO
@LBFF42 ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
Ok I just found out why the rain sucks in Breath of the Wild
@richnairn same name on instagram?
@richnairn i do love it! Can I repost one of those on instagram tomorrow?
@REGUL80R ah the cheese castle. and points for the pun!
@PierreTPelican no don't awaken the beast @KingCakeBaby!!! It's thirsty for human blood and sinew!!!
@PierreTPelican I mean I can't swallow souls or anything but I think I've got the voice down!
@prennie37 thanks, Paul!
@mrbnatural üíç
@DannyTRS we're still waiting for the Grudge to show up!
WUT. There's a Grudge vs The Ring movie on @shudder? I'm guessing I never heard of it b/c it's amazing right? Get ready @LydiaHearst! #7days
I think @LouieAnderson should get all the Emmys for Christine Baskets. I love this show so much.
Just in time for Summah... @NBCTheWall RETURNS!!! https://t.co/YdzQG9WCtI
@smn1331 @1iota @AMCTalkingDead  I'm sure they can help! Gang, let's get Stephanie some tix!

@MyNameisRazzle2 @wilw we may never know for sure
@wilw @AnneWheaton Which song? Give Talkin?
@GoStabby for SHAME. Gary Gnu was not a Muppet!!! He was on the Great Space Coaster.
https://t.co/02GxXM39im https://t.co/5jvOM0fvm2
@MyNameisRazzle2 @wilw if you're hearing magnets then it's time to put the tin foil hat back on, Razzle
@wilw It's not your fault! You were just trying to retrieve @AnneWheaton's watch. It's a Gucci, right? #hardG
@wilw but did you ever figure out how fuckin magnets work?
@wilw I'm sorry but I think you're confusing Gigolo and Juggalo
@maramoran uh huh. And I'm using your own argument about greek origins justifying pronunciation to prove my point. So thank you!!!
@maramoran yes our language is derived from many others. good point? over 50% from Latin, which used hard G.
@wilw That explains a lot. Your pronunciation skills are as backwards as the R in his temple.
@maramoran what's the storage capacity your phone then? And what's your band going to get paid to play at?
@wilw To your Jod?
@wilw your universal translator must be on the fritz! I only pronounce it the correct way.
@LiberalVeg VERY VERY
Being in NY for 11 hours and back home already definitely makes one feel all wibbly wobbly timey wimey. #SpaghettiBrain
Director Danny Boyle is on the latest @nerdist podcast and his passion/enthusiasm/kindness are infectious! Listen! https://t.co/MfOMdZMUdH
@Mike_DeRusha HARDWICK IS A #FAKENERD
@SuperSethPowers weird! Not me though!
@Dr_GeoFry well you and the Salinger can suck it. And why hashtag that word?? The Oscar Wilde in me declares that pretentious.
@KellyJoyceSr I'd say maybe just focus on your own life choices. How's that sound, Person I've Never Met? :)
@garrettyork @jk_rowling I would agree. Maybe he's the author of "Whale Tales: Conversations In Breach of Nature", stories told by whales?
@seanodaniels mayhaps!
@LaughingPickle Jordan!
@The_Dr_Defense HARDWICKS UNITE ON UNITED
@tonynic35 :)
@steve_cornett ha I know! Thank you!!

@realericfreeman @wardwick @Variety hahaha Wardwick
@TheShaunHarris they're mostly stepped and work more like a stairway. I love the simple ingenuity of it.
@vanya42nd BUT THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
Oh and a fish ladder is basically a stairway for fish. I've always been fascinated by them https://t.co/1zY6SHdqHR
@CrashAtMyPad thank you, Eric!!
Hey let's make some tv stuff! https://t.co/bzVva9Jb28
@CrashAtMyPad isn't he rad??
@KatReimer oh wow! nice! that's him!!!
@raiface @united I'm sorry to hear that! We didn't hear back either. I hope they figure out a better system for their passengers' sake.
@ColB @NightValeRadio @HighEdWeb I say I guess I need to take that bit out of my act now! Oh well. I still think it's a sandwich.
@vulpus_umbra how would I have seen that?? You didn't tag me in it! Even if you had, tens of THOUSANDS come through. Points I guess?
@fredonair @cristalmishel I remember that show. pfffft yeah I bet THAT guy never wound up doing anything!
@temujinbk @midnight I went more current https://t.co/C8J2YV3l6u

@Derek_Langston @midnight sweet!
HAPPY PI DAY ERRYBODY!!! https://t.co/erYTTQ0ju7 w/ @phirm dir by @keithscho
@AlanTudyk it was one of the most fun things I've ever gotten to do
@airsam49 it hasn't! not looking good at this point. thank you for asking though!
@janew44 oh I was just kidding. They just don't use the Z word on the show.
ü§ó https://t.co/G4RmRnVXEj
@davvves so do I. I'm a notorious creditor because it's the right thing to do. I don't know what happened but I wish he would've called me.
@davvves I don't run day to day operations but I'm more than happy to try to figure out what's going on. These blocks are automated I think.
@davvves I have no fucking idea! And WHY wouldn't Keith contact me since he has all my info?? I could have investigated &amp; fixed it!
@beercart yes. On that we agree.
@davvves I have never blocked ANYONE on YouTube. EVER. I don't know what happened. Consider asking a QUESTION before making accusations.
@beercart ...for EVERYONE not just people with large twitter accounts. My hope is that corp office sees and considers change (tho unlikely).
@beercart ...DID take responsibility. We didn't blame anyone else for the mistake of leaving it. They need better customer service...
@beercart ...being able to call a lost &amp; found dept. It's a laptop that even if we DO get back won't be for ages w/ this system. And we...
@beercart uh huh. We'll see how soapboxy you get when you forget something &amp; the only solution is to fill out a form instead of...
@RoelVeldhuyzen @united shrunken electronic space gator that's also a bag
@afflictionate I do! Which makes me appreciate the nice ones even more. Thank you! :)
@SuaveRob5 haha yeah he and I have SO MUCH in common. Come to think of it, I do have little hands...DAMMIT
@JoseMolinaTV no worries. another human moment! we all have them. have a good night!
@JoseMolinaTV ...filling out forms will likely not help. I love my wife and would do anything to help her so please don't shame me for that.
@JoseMolinaTV There are irreplaceable files from her deceased father and the backup is corrupt. Time is essential for lost items and...
@JoseMolinaTV it's not "immediately" jose. They don't have any plan for customers' lost items AT ALL other than forms.
Ok thankfully @united has agreed to help locate my dear wife's lost item!
@MrShakesbeer they do.
@shirleman their service should be better for people with 0 followers! Basically, for any customer who gives them money, ya know?
@TMBruzz1 you'll be fine! just make sure not to leave anything behind on the plane! flying is safer than driving. :)
@ObscuReference @Meretron BRINGING NICE PEOPLE TOGETHER SINCE 2017!
@writergeekrhw unfortunately the storm in NY is imminent, and @united has no way to contact a person to even ask if they have it.
@united ...your customers who made a simple mistake in the melee of travel. I'm sorry to say you've lost two of them tonight for good.
@united I'm sure you can understand that when something is left on a plane time is of the essence. A form into the void is unhelpful to...
@CassieBrimacomb HI BACK!!! :D
@dantelfer @united the crazy thing is that when something is left on a plane, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. We'll never fly them again.
@ObscuReference I can't believe you remember that!! :D
@IdealGasLaw well when your loved one loses something that's irreplaceable then see how snarky you are about the bad customer service
Gang, you better hope you never leave anything on a @united flight you need and hope to get it back quickly cuz they ain't helpin'. #forms https://t.co/cpupLhP2VA
@united hey United, there HAS to be a better way to get something back before it disappears forever. Especially if you need it asap.
@sciwriter thanks!
@sciwriter we thought the correct pronunciation was funnier because it make it clunky.
@timewalkyrwho I'M FANCY
@MikeClatterbuck we did that AGES ago. Ages!
@united hey! My wife left something on a plane and customer service has not been helpful at all. Do you have any suggestions??
@saintpiercing could have been Aaron Paul, Charlie Day or Matt Bellamy.
@saintpiercing nope! I've been at @midnight all day!
@sunset__sunday thank you :)
@PurlHalyk I'll see if I can track it down for you!
@Daviesman @AMCTalkingDead that would be AMAZING. I love the UK so much!
@shazzzzakhan I would apply the same gif to someone who doesn't have to watch it but complains about it anyway. ;)
@xxM0l0xx but going out of your way to insult another human being to feel superior about yourself is a-ok though, right Stephen? Nice! :)
@Daviesman hi! sadly, we can never be live in the UK because of the time difference. This show won't be live here either, though!
@eavoss hey! watched your Logan video! Dumb question...they only upgraded Laura's claws to adamantium and not her ENTIRE skeleton, right?
@EvilAngelVideo @Engine26Studios @midnight @adrianachechik I saw Dan's tweet first. This all makes a lot more sense after seeing the rest.
@TongueInCheekSF you should have just started giving wrong information and fake spoilers!
@SewellToronto I certainly don't hate you over a tweet. Be well. :)
@SewellToronto ...then I must respectfully disagree with you and say good day. Take care! :)
@SewellToronto but if you would rather double down on your statement than even TRY to see that it might have been a tad rude...
@SewellToronto and the supposition of your statement is that I am a liar, which is equally insulting and not true. That's the point, Adam.
@SewellToronto Telling someone what they are definitely thinking is NOT the same thing. If someone did that to you you'd HATE it.
@SewellToronto But I'll take your word that you didn't mean anything by it and wish you a better day. :)
@SewellToronto I mean I responded with the EXACT SAME TONE you sent out and you didn't like it. It's just not very nice, is all.
@SewellToronto hate the show, that's fine! It's your absolute right. But please don't pin your opinions in my head. You wouldn't like it.
@SewellToronto thank you but that doesn't justify the rudeness of acting like 1) you know what's in my head and 2) that I'm lying about it.
@SewellToronto it's painfully obvious you have no clue or real facts about me but want to talk like you do because hey, internet.
@lesliemp_ you're the best!
@RedbichLives @enarra how do you pronounce it? I just didn't want to mess it up!
@itsDevT82 Thank you!!
@Obi_Wan_Jakolby @WalkingDead_AMC DEFINITELY
@dbercegeay I mean seriously, Derick, what is the point of this kind of negativity?
@VegasFilmCritic thank you!! :D
@Chris_Donovan haha you know that's a GREAT question!
@baldwin_erik BDAY SHOUT OUT!!!
@SchuellerStacey oh you mean annoying, like, being rude to a complete stranger annoying? ;) and YOU RULE @PrincessHallee!!!
@CharleyA82 And I don't watch twitter to get complained at. I mean, since we're sharing our unsolicited motivations and everything. ;)
@PieterJKetelaar zing
@joeypadron @AMCTalkingDead Thanks!
@Corbyluv ;)
@Wasted84Youth people STILL ask about him when I'm out in the world!!
BOB FROM CHATTANOOGA. I love this day. @AMCTalkingDead
@PDBax I created this festival. I've been performing at music festivals for 15 years, sir.
@PDBax you don't know me AT ALL. Like at all. At all at all. But hey why be atypical for the internet right?
@_ZomBriii_ actually 45!!! But don't tell anyone!
@BHTilt I'd strip naked, find all the pudding in the kitchen &amp; gorge on handfuls of it while singing TV theme songs until my head blew up.
@Johnveith8 IT'S A PERSON!!!
@GregECP oh hey! btw @LydiaHearst &amp; I enjoyed Wolf Creek (movie and series)!!! Did you meet at @screamfest??
@skc177 @HardwickFC if you ever get tired of winning &amp; want to recruit a guy with zero experience who can't make practices, I'M YOUR MAN! :D
@BritishCPA @midnight cheers! Thank you!!
@wilw @Kwongerific truth!
@BritishCPA I'm hooked! But I think they get too caught up with cool high speed camera shots on colorful sets to let the audience in.
Last chance to get "Eugene Brings The Sex" shirt! Orders cut off tonight at 11p PT. Git over to https://t.co/3mjLFlo9CL asap! @JoshMcDermitt https://t.co/IZ3tODbMEL
@Kwongerific @wilw hm. good question. We'll take a short recess and reconvene.
@Kwongerific @wilw well, "dammit Wil" is an inside joke that predates "shut up Wesley" SO THE "DAMMIT WIL" STANDS!!!
@BritishCPA look I do like it! I just wish they would sacrifice a little of the snazzy style for a bit more linear storytelling.
@NerdistMom @Joieparent fantastic victory Joie! :)
Holy crumbs! Belko Experiment is INSANE. If you like violent, fucked up twisty movies you will LOVE it! Nice work @JamesGunn!!

@HannaFlint Agreed &amp; understood! If you ever do a story on podcasting let me know and we can properly chat! Thank you &amp; have a great day! :)
@HannaFlint but PLEASE do not take this as an insult or an attack on you or what you do. Journos like you HAVE to fight the good fight!
@HannaFlint and btw, I include myself in that group who's had bad experiences.
@HannaFlint You have to remember that to us, we're one person talking to them but to THEM, we're 1 of thousands who are not all great.
@HannaFlint ...can be exploited so they're protective. Not by real journalist folks like yourself, but a few bad apples spoil the barrel.
@HannaFlint almost every one of them has some bad experience where they were burned by someone trying to get a scoop. these folks...
@HannaFlint w/ all due respect, most of the people who come on don't like the word. The reason being that interviews usually have an agenda.
@HannaFlint my openly explaining my process to you isn't my crapping on anyone else. I'm just sharing what works for me b/c you asked. :)
@HannaFlint and I don't consider myself a journo not as an insult but b/c it's a skillset I don't have. I don't do research or have a plan.
@HannaFlint it's not narrow minded...it's my opinion. not crapping on journos. it's just how I do it and I'd have to say it works for me :)
@HannaFlint Ok thanks again! Have a nice day!!! :)
@HannaFlint ...you really get to know them a bit better than if they were reciting answers to a bullet point list of questions.
@HannaFlint PS: by "defensive" I mean "protective". Conversation's casual comfort level helps people lower their shields and open up so...
@HannaFlint ...start talking and I kind of just let it go where it does depending on their energy. Hope that helps! Thank you for listening!
@HannaFlint ...like you're meeting someone for coffee is a more relaxed setting. Also, they're never planned beforehand. We sit down...
@HannaFlint interviews are very one-way, and most people don't enjoy being questioned for an hour straight. A conversation that feels...
@HannaFlint Mainly because I'm not a journalist. And interviews create a more defensive, interrogation-like environment than conversations.

@DWSTwit @KevinKleinLIVE the band?
@kylevogt ha!
@scorchingshark thank you!
@KevinKleinLIVE I believe in you
@meskin84 ironic, huh?
@dantelfer It is funny that we're now in an age where, if someone doesn't know something, it's "useless" rather than outside their knowledge
@PasteMagazine (also I'd love to throw you some tix and have you as my guest)
Thx for the post! But ID10T isn't pronounced ID-(ten)-T for a "useless reason". It's a joke IT code for "user error". #TheMoreYouKnow :D https://t.co/Z5Z8Cb6Pz5
@JakeVincent37 you know it!
@bowenkerins @CAExtremeOrg awesome! shoot me an email: stuff@nerdist.com

@bpottz05 eh...not sure what show YOU were watching but I think your noticing skills may be off tonight. :)
@Ascension @NBCTheWall thank you!
In case you were wondering--yes! A spider CAN crawl in the sensor of a networked smoke detector and set them all off in your house at 3am.
@Hari718 thank you! Glad you dug it!
@hodgesart fanks!

@AKatz87 yes I will try to remember to do this!
@tweet_ski NICE
@4realchris thanks Chris!
@Deacon527 I totally would!
@lancewaste KIND of, but with more of a comic con panel structure.
@Clidebytor try it at home. It's at the corner of Sack and Taint.
@TheOnlySchmooy fellow Memphian, you'd be QUITE unhappy if someone pounded them flat over ANYTHING. #KeepBallsRound
@Hanakittyy :D
@Kadamaki_ definitely!!

About to do FB Live so come over to https://t.co/OX88l7ii01! Q&amp;A about Talking show (and whatever else)

@KevinRadloff @nerdist we do! Lyds and I love it!
The @nerdist podcast today is one of my absolute, all-time biggest comedy idols, Catherine O'Hara. She is FLAWLESS https://t.co/1L5ZmmdsoJ
Southern California! I'll be performing at the @TheIrvineImprov tomorrow and Sat, 2 shows each night. Get tix here: https://t.co/4SRzMaQJVG

@AubreyMD of course!
@tSqueeG yes! And the Mirror of Erised said I'm HEAD BOY
@Kairi091 neat
@KyaCloud well I mean you COULD just click over to https://t.co/RLTFvtsO1H. You can do it from the same place you would have watched hulu!
You know what you need in your life? A "Eugene Brings The Sex" shirt https://t.co/6HPd05UIdA @WalkingDead_AMC @AMCTalkingDead @JoshMcDermitt
I partnered w/ @zillow for a walkthru of our old timey house! Hidden stairways, vintage taxidermy &amp; GRIFFIN SCONCES: https://t.co/fKuIXbIBNK https://t.co/kIv59P4e8b
@TheJennieB I sympathize!
@BuzzardToombs well that seems harsh yet inaccurate. You ok, buddy??
@DevinDSheffield CLUB. SODA. I go through tons of it.
@_jsmnne phew I got off kinda easy on that one!
@willam :D
@NervousandNerdy mostly breathing and keeping heart rate down. It's difficult to be anxious if your heart isn't pounding really hard!!
@NervousandNerdy i did not! Early early on they gave me xanax, which I broke into 1/4 but stopped after a few times for fear of addiction.
Daaaaaaamn @WolverineMovie was reaaaaaaally goooood. SUPER dark too. Definitely see it. Standing O to @RealHughJackman &amp; @SirPatStew! #Logan
@GodHandGuts JAMES DELANEY IS A DANGEROUS MAN
@Darrenlegallo hey man great seeing you the other night! got a quick time sensitive question for you. shoot me a DM!
@BlowUpRadio civil conversation is always the best path! :)
@BlowUpRadio Ah I didn't see that. But thank you! And I'm sorry I misunderstood your intention. I get attacked a lot so it's hard to tell!
@BlowUpRadio and on top of all that, how am I really supposed to know if someone is on the level or not, ya know?
@BlowUpRadio but for you to report to people that I'm a jerk who blocked you out of hate is equally disappointing.
@BlowUpRadio yeah but I don't know you at all. So I don't always know what's a joke and what isn't. Usually it isn't.
@BlowUpRadio ...and insults me out of the blue, what am I supposed to think?
@BlowUpRadio thousands and thousands of people teeet at me. I don't know what's actually real or not, and when someone attacks...
@BlowUpRadio attack tactics are not okay. So you're actually supporting the opposite of what you claim. No hate from my end at all! :)
@BlowUpRadio I blocked because they flat out called me a trump puppet w/ a photoshop pic. Maybe don't insult people you want to help you?
@ryanevfischer üëçüèºüëçüèº
@HippoJuiceShaun Viacom's deal expired so lots of cc shows are not on Hulu anymore. They're over at https://t.co/RLTFvtsO1H now.
@Steevi93 sure! We'll make that happen!
@CaptainN31986 @Borderlands Thanks! It was so much fun to do!
@ZackPeercy @midnight haha that's a fair point
@josh_wick I think so! It's really touristy but I think worth seeing. Our guide told us not to spend too much time in that area though.
We're back on @midnight tonight!! Still at 11:30! Please join our shenanigans.
@RyanSeacrest ok no Negan beard yet. But it looks like it's creeping back in that direction! On the plus side Eugene's mullet is bulletproof
@SethCrichton Teen Titans Bro!
@ColeEdwardsCole nice work!
@ColeEdwardsCole ha! Did you design this??
@janedoeee1028 I tryyyyyyyyyy!
I'm sorry I can't do a Talking Oscars, everyone! You'll have to work this one out for yourselves!
@ThatHelena @1iota whoa hey! Congratulations!!!
@CCWalker060360 keep watching! I'm planning on referencing that in a bit...
@nategdunbar he says hi back!
@Rconway86 so I should die. Nice one dude. You seem great.
Screw the Oscars! Watch the Eugenies tonight on @AMCTalkingDead! We're on in 30 min w/ @JoshMcDermitt @austin_amelio &amp; @LilJon! #WHAT
@ZombiePrepKit @1iota they said 4:15 is the time to line up! Lemme know if you have any problems
@ZombiePrepKit ok you'll be on @1iota's list soon!
@ZombiePrepKit what's your name? I'll guest list you myself
@ZombiePrepKit did they get back to you?
@jasonryals414 and you're REALLY going to be the "um actually" guy THE DAY SOMEONE DIED?? Jesus dude. Learn how to human a little.
@jasonryals414 not in the fucking least. Line up every role. His performances were seamless.
NOOOO not Bill Paxton!!! That's awful! Truly one of the best actors. And sweet! He recited some Chet lines at @Comic_Con 2013. Made my year.
@ZombiePrepKit I'll get you in. @1iota please give them tix!
@chelsmark https://t.co/L6OcGiCXZn
@LibraMonkee eh...@pattonoswalt would DESTROY me. He is a nerd god among men. I'm more on the level of a nerd comptroller.
@Bromodrosis hahaha AGREED
@MeAndNintendo Right?? Such a great film with an original story. Jordan knocked it out of the park.
@jenna_champagne @shawn_champagne hey both o ya! Hope your disney day was fun too!!
@Super_Duper_Mo it was!
@daleatkinson push it with pride
@schizophobe don't bullschtime me!
@dizzyeyed and remember, so this because you're worth it. And go easy on yourself! We're supposed to be happy. Embrace it! #hugs
@dizzyeyed so I got help. Sober friends, a good therapist. AA works for a lot of people--you need a solid support structure.
@dizzyeyed ...and I decided that I wanted to try for something better. A life I could design and be in control of my decisions.
@dizzyeyed this is going to sound overly simplified, but it was largely that I knew exactly where a live w/ alcohol was going to lead me...
@t3chxsuprt what a nice gift. Is this your usual gig?
@SheepThings just ask @kt_money!
@saintpiercing fuck! nice one!
@ThatTroyChriest I'm not!
Mr. @JordanPeele has returned to the @nerdist podcast! He's a fantastic guest and his film "Get Out" is MUST SEE. https://t.co/WBzZKzThFG
@KasperBrandon yeah, people love to throw this one at me but I still say he's not a linguist. #HardG4Life
@DanielRusteau could I use the same gif to throw back at you for skipping the intro where we gave a spoiler warning but still complained?
@NicholeMaddox87 @midnight :)
@ChrisDoelle fans don't go out of their way to spew that kind of rude crap. so please go be a fan of someone else.
@omarg wait maybe I am? MAYBE I HAVE BEEN THIS WHOLE TIME
@JulieSHill66 I don't! I think they're different. Whisperers appear way later in the comics' story line.
Wuh oh. Unsolicited-by-me twitter password reset code just came through. That's not awesome. STOP TRYING TO HACK MY ACCOUNT @RYANSEACREST
@AComicNerd true, true. but I really did try to watch w/ just a fan's eye and I really did love it! Excited for other fans to see it!
With @MST3K, they managed to make it hilarious, totally fresh yet still respectful of the original. It's obvious they're all fans!
In the not too distant future...@MST3K is out April 14th on @netflix! Saw the 1st ep. @jonahray @JoelGHodgson &amp; crew did a PHENOMENAL job.

@Forchy I was so so on the 1st season of that show but it got really good in season 2!
@CrescendoCove Nope.
Watched Arrival and Pixels back to back and pretended it was all one movie. It oddly worked.
@RisnerJoey ok I'll do it!
@jaymz5329 I don't know what's goin' on out east! I only know about the west coast happenings!
@shazmtaz1 Thank you!
@Ceasar209 yeah that sounds about right
@Deanna_APR @NBCTheWall @GlassmanMedia @SpringHillEnt @KingJames HI DEANNA! Hope all is wonderful! #hugs
@wilw @NBCTheWall how dare you william #NBCTheWil
Fingers crossed! #AshleAndXandi @NBCTheWall
well ok. #NBCTheWallCall https://t.co/WI4b9ie8l8
Now that you all know what @NBCTheWall is, I won't have to explain the rules so in depth on the next wave of eps!
Whoa wait WHAT?? @WaltDisneyWorld is getting Pandora World??? Well we're getting Star Wars Land at @Disneyland next year!
MILLIONS on toppa MILLIONS on toppa MILLIONS on toppa MILLIONS!!! (it really is possible on @NBCTheWall! TAKE THAT, every other show)
10 min until the @NBCTheWall SEASON FINALE!!! (East Coast, of course)
@JustinTErickson yeah no more Hulu. They're over at https://t.co/RLTFvtsO1H now
@IllinoisActor oh nice! I'm performing at the Irvine improv march 3 &amp; 4
@pjaluthor OH THANK THE GODS. Cheers!
@pjaluthor serious #nerdfail YOU for not knowing that. ;)
@pjaluthor are you SERIOUSLY suggesting I don't know that? You DO NOT refer to film specific events w/ the blanket term Star Wars.
@IllinoisActor thanks! Are you in Chicago?
@jfield I know. I've lived in LA since 1988!
IRVINE, CA! Deep in the County called Orange! https://t.co/EnDh79CoOy
@Paganmom08 thank you!
@BSqueeze303 it's not airing on tv. we are probably going to do it on facebook live
Just announced! We're doing @midnight at @sxsw on 3/10! w/ @thomaslennon @WhitneyCummings @NickSwardson https://t.co/zXdlt306fC https://t.co/YeP4nmFbJG
@Mike_DeRusha haha well yeah that too
The process of hosting game shows in @THR: https://t.co/btOpazLUYh https://t.co/SdAaLqQgmz
@chaddenick sorry yours is malfunctioning!
@wishboneandvine haha ok we can split the diff
@wishboneandvine They didn't get pushed into the trash compactor to fight anything on purpose...RANCOR ALL THE WAY
@AdrielsTweets @NerdistPodcast Diesel! They make a bunch of different ones https://t.co/m7GWi1NraE
@WFLBC he was the COOLEST dog!!!!
@MikeCCecil yes. please see any of my comments on this in my timeline already. ;)
@wesleyladams13 yeah I get him, Matt Bellamy, Charlie Day and Aaron Paul mostly
@wesleyladams13 whatever follows "has anyone ever told you..." the answer is usually yes x 100,000. ;)
@CiscoShawn #fistpump
@CiscoShawn so you can say that something is part of SW or in its universe but you wouldn't refer to specific events in films that way
@CiscoShawn We're right! People forget that "A New Hope" wasn't the name of the first film until 1981. It was just "Star Wars" before that.
@bunnyhugger75 @marinavstweets @DavidKantrowitz @midnight good company with the Calvin &amp; Hobbes!
@runningontime he was born in rural TN and lived a good chunk of his life in rural Alabama.
@CiscoShawn I see...so if someone asked you which movie Jabba's pleasure barge was in, what would you say? :)
@jxmietate I don't! I just had say in how Rufus was designed.
@MarionGrey44 please go antagonize to feel better elsewhere. That is clearly your goal today. Take care! :)
@MarionGrey44 omg are you referring to a screw up from 5 years ago?? And I'm no expert on eps 1-3. I saw them all once and that was enough.
@MarionGrey44 it's just negativity for negativity's sake. And you may have noticed, but there is quite enough of that in the world right now
@MarionGrey44 and telling someone something is "unlistenable" isn't actionable at all. I don't know that person or his/her preferences.
