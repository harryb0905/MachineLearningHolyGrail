At 6:15 AM CST IÔ∏è will be joining @NBCDFW to talk about President Trump‚Äôs State of the Union address last night.
Great speech tonight from POTUS echoing our victories this year and reaffirming his commitment to making our nation safer and stronger. Read my full statement on #SOTU here: https://t.co/bssIPjOnpG
Proud to have a  Commander-in-Chief who recognizes the threat of ISIS and doesn't treat them like the "J.V. team." In one year, we  have liberated 98% of the territory held by these radical Islamic extremists.
Today I proudly supported for the third time legislation to fund our military for the full year. It is time for #SenateDemocrats to responsibly act and stop holding military funding hostage.
Border security is a critical component of any immigration reform. We must gain operational control of our borders.
This year I proudly supported legislation to take MS-13 gangs off of our streets and lock them up. I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect our families from this dangerous group of thugs.
I support the President in his effort to crack down on sanctuary cities, combat the infiltration of MS-13 gangs, and secure our communities.
We need to invest in our American workers so they can have the opportunities they need and deserve to reach their full potential.
Obama's regulatory red tape was strangling our economy. We have finally cut through these unnecessary regulations and unleashed the free enterprise system.
Republicans have delivered on our promises this year - we repealed the onerous individual mandate, cut taxes for job creators &amp; families, and created more opportunities for all hard working Americans.
Always great joining my friend on @TheWellsReport. Listen live now on @usaradiolive to hear my thoughts on the President‚Äôs State of the Union address tonight. https://t.co/MY8cS9XksA

This week we continued to provide tax relief for hard working Americans by delaying three of the most onerous Obamacare taxes: the health insurance tax, the ‚ÄúCadillac Tax,‚Äù and the medical device tax.
I'm looking forward to joining @WBAP247NEWS this morning to discuss the end of the unnecessary, and irresponsible #SchumerShutdown.
Just voted to reauthorize the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program for six years. I‚Äôm delighted that this critical bill is heading to the President‚Äôs desk to become law.
I‚Äôm on the @HouseFloor now to make sure we can expeditiously pass the Continuing resolution and reopen the government.
The Senate is voting again this afternoon. I strongly urge them to do the responsible thing and end this #SchumerShutdown
If you have questions about the status of federal agencies and services during the #SchumerShutdown, visit my website: https://t.co/fhlaKmjiwa
The #Schumershutdown will not keep me from serving the people of #TX32. Both of my offices in Dallas and Washington will be open and operating as normal.
I‚Äôm about to join @NBCDFW from my office in Washington to discuss the #SchumerShutdown.
House Republicans have voted 4 times to reauthorize and fund the Children's Health Insurance Program. This program is too important for Senate Democrats to hold hostage because of a manufactured crisis. Stop playing games and end this #SchumerShutdown. https://t.co/f6wb1Tyb9O
On the @HouseFloor now: @repgregwalden is setting the record straight on Democrats continued obstruction for #CHIP funding. Because of this, 7 states are about to run out of money and millions of children risk losing their health insurance.
We are trying to continue our Rules debate on the @HouseFloor but Democrats have decided they want to further obstruct our progress. It‚Äôs clear they have no intention of ending their #SchumerShutdown.
The @RulesReps was hard at work this morning to ensure the House has maximum flexibility to reopen the government. I‚Äôm managing the rule now. Watch live on @cspan https://t.co/Vr0KTh3an1
The @RulesReps is up and working this morning. We are meeting to put in place procedural tools so we can continue to work to reopen the govt and end this #SchumerShutdown.
Because of the #SchumerShutdown here is what Americans are waking up to this morning - More than 2 million members of our military won‚Äôt be paid, 100,000 national guardsmen will be sent home from training, and 9 million children on #CHIP could have their health insurance lapse
Democrats have made their choice - party politics over our men and women in uniform and children's healthcare.
Senate Democrats are inching closer and closer to forcing a govt shutdown over a completely unrelated policy matter. It's sad to see their complete and utter disregard for our nation's men and women in uniform and their willingness to let CHIP funding run dry.
I have proudly joined voted to reauthorize the CHIP program 4 times since November. It is time for Senate Democrats to stop playing politics with children's health insurance. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/z538QB1JSY
Tonight I proudly voted to keep the government open and ensure millions of children across the country have access to health care through the CHIP program. It's time Senate Democrats stop playing politics w/govt funding and this critical program.
Senate Democrats gleefully announced that they are willing to shutdown the government and let CHIP funding run dry. I look forward to voting yes on the Continuing Resolution to keep our doors open and ensure CHIP is reauthorized for 6 years.

We MUST take every possible measure to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists.
POLL: Do you believe the President‚Äôs lack of strategy against ISIS is jeopardizing our national security?
Lifting the oil export ban will create 1 million American jobs and add $179 billion annually to our GDP.
Thanks to House solutions in the year-end spending bill we are finally exporting #crudeoil #Yes2Energy #SOTU
Gas prices have fallen in large part because of increases in American energy production.#Yes2Energy #SOTU
@EPA's #CapAndTrade is based on assumptions, hurts US families &amp; understates real economic impacts #SOTU
#POTUS says he wants to cut through red tape when his Admin. has imposed $73 billion of regulatory burdens on American families &amp; businesses
POLL: Do you support my efforts to dismantle #ObamaCare?
I have voted more than 60 times to repeal #ObamaCare. It‚Äôs time for a free-market based solution to healthcare. #SOTU
Under #ObamaCare more than 5.6 million plans have been cancelled.
#ObamaCare has caused premiums to rise on average of 7.5% annually.
FACT: The number of Americans working is at its lowest level since 1978. #SOTU
GDP growth is hovering just above an anemic 2%, well below the 3% historical trend of real GDP growth. #SOTU
According to the @WSJ our economic expansion is the worst on record since WWII. https://t.co/nFjxtDOvkv
