Would seem surprising if Jets-Dolphins isn‚Äôt a nationally-televised game in first few weeks of 2019 NFL season.
I don‚Äôt know if Adam Gase will win big with Jets. But Gase will undoubtedly make a positive impact on Sam Darnold. Gase has a special connection with his starting QBs.
New York Jets head coach Adam Gase is scheduled to face the Dolphins, Patriots and Bills twice each in 2019, oh, and Jarvis Landry and Jay Ajayi (if he re-ups with Philly), too.
In three seasons under Adam Gase, the Dolphins were 31st, 25th and 31st in the NFL in first downs per game. The Jets were 27th, 29th and 30th.
This one clip is not really illustrative of the typical Gase experience. And do I think he will benefit greatly from the missteps he made in Miami. https://t.co/Cg1T8YF83w

New England projected by  Over The Cap to add a draft picks in 3rd (Solder), 3rd (Butler), 5th (Amendola) and 7th (Cameron Fleming). Miami not projected to add any.

Torry McTyer (concussion) out for Miami Dolphins. Reshad Jones (leg) is questionable. Miami goes with Bobby McCain, Minkah Fitzpatrick, Jalen Davis and Cornell Armstrong.
Ryan Tannehill caught a TD pass! Ryan Tannehill caught a TD pass! Tannehill from Kenny Stills! #MiamiDolphins
Yeah so Kenyan Drake just trucked a Bill. Because, you know, he shouldn't be touching the ball more.
DeVante Parker has gotten better at breaking up interceptions #MiamiDolphins
Miami Dolphins: 2 sacks, 2 turnovers, 2.7 yards per play, 1 penalty, 1-for-4 on third down
Nick O'Leary has had some poor pass pro blocks in the last three games. He's a good blocker and to be fair he's been matched with some good pass rushers. #MiamiDolphins

Ryan Tannehill has been sacked 5 times today. He's been sacked 12 times in his last three starts. Some on him. A lot on OL, too. #MiamiDolphins
Imagine you're Ryan Tannehill. "Protect the football. But I have to make a play. Make a good decision. But we need yards. Make the safe play. But they say I don't convert third downs on the road in the fourth quarter. Whoah! There's someone in my grill again!"
Kenny Stills does not have a catch. Ryan Tannehill, on the road, fourth quarter, 3rd down. Here it is...
The Dolphins defense, under Matt Burke, has settled down after an awful start. Interception, Punt, Punt, Field Goal, Punt. Vikings fans booing. All good after first quarter.
Credit Leonte Carroo for good effort in not giving up on long punt return by the Vikings
Vikings fans booing! WTH.
I love that Kalen Ballage was taken with the Jay Ajayi pick. Similar talent IMO.
Ryan Tannehill threw it to Nick O'Leary, the tight-lipped but rugged Palm Beacher, but he was rocked near the goal line and the ball popped out
Kenyan Drake is an explosive play-maker. I don't mind mixing in the talented Kalen Ballage. But let's see what Drake can do with workload.

Tom Brady and Ryan Tannehill are both throwing it really well today. On the way to a barn burner.

Matt Burke: ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve done a good job... there‚Äôs calls I regret... the feedback I worry about is Adam... I try to give him what he wants.‚Äù #MiamiDolphins
On scrutiny, Matt Burke says it‚Äôs a part of the job. What matters is the option of coach, owner and front office. #MiamiDolphins
Why was Charles Clay so open? ‚ÄúIt was such a long play,‚Äù Miami DC Matt Burke said. ‚ÄúHe was almost hiding in the back of the end zone. Couple people should have had a chance to get to him.‚Äù
Charles Harris should have blocked a punt vs. Bills, Darren Rizzi says. Shouldn‚Äôt have left his feet. Rizzi was not happy.
Walt Aikens has become a more vocal, tremendous leader the last two years. Emotional. Energy. Effort. Catalyst. All per Darren Rizzi. #MiamiDolphins

The most easily overlooked play in a wild Dolphins overtime victory on Sunday was T.J. McDonald's end zone interception, as Chicago was looking for a 28-13 lead in the fourth quarter.

Yes, it is my opinion that what MLB has created here with this bracket is both confusing and excessive, considering they play 162 games. https://t.co/CwXGbeB8EP
After 162 games, deciding a champion in a system that this year includes four one-game playoff games and then 5 game series and 7 game series is confusing and nonsensical, IMO. Not to mention games are always played way too late at night. https://t.co/bDvzUSk5yw
Looking at the 2018 MLB Playoff Bracket and have a headache. The Rockies play the Dodgers in one game and the Brewers play the Cubs in one game but the losers aren't even eliminated? I'm still trying to get used to the Astros in the AL Playoffs and the Brewers in the NL Playoffs.
The only NFL teams with a winning record but a negative point differential are the Miami Dolphins (3-1) and Denver Broncos (2-1).
Over the first four games of the season, the Dolphins defense has allowed half of third-downs to be converted. That's 30th in the NFL at the moment.
At the moment there are 36 NFL players with more rushing attempts and 48 with more rushing yards than Kenyan Drake. Somehow, anyhow, this has to change in the second quarter of the Miami Dolphins season.
In the second quarter of the Miami Dolphins season, their opponents are: 3-1 (@CIN), 3-1 (CHI), 1-3 (DET) and 1-3 (@HOU).

Dowell Loggains said Jesse Davis had a good game last week vs. Jets and Ted Larsen and Daniel Kilgore were solid. #MiamiDolphins
Mike Gesicki is working on escaping jams at the line of scrimmage. It's an area of focus for improvement per OC Dowell Loggains.
Charles Harris gets frustrated, DC Matt Burke says. The Dolphins have spoken with him about not pressing.
Raekwon McMillan had poor technique on the TD pass to Bilal Powell but Matt Burke says he didn't get help and he didn't put McMillan in the best position on that play
Xavien Howard knows what's happening more and more and so that allows him to play with more and more confidence, Matt Burke says #MiamiDolphins
Bobby McCain will bite your face off, defensive coordinator Matt Burke says. That's a nice thing to say (about a football player). #MiamiDolphins
Matt Burke said he wishes he'd gotten Jerome Baker in the game a bit more last week #MiamiDolphins
Bobby McCain should be fine. Not considered serious.
CB Cornell Armstrong graded out quite well on special teams last week and WR Tanner McEvoy has taken on a key role in punt protection and coverage, Darren Rizzi said. At some point he thinks RB Kalen Ballage will get his shot.
Matt Haack was a "weapon," Dolphins special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi said.

DEVELOPING: How DeVante Parker‚Äôs finger injury feels three days before Raiders game  #MiamiDolphins https://t.co/zaZktEhqyR https://t.co/e1Feo7TLCB
DeVante Parker has a small carbon fiber brace that goes over his two fingers and then gets wrapped with tape. Hasn‚Äôt been an issue, he says.
DeVante Parker has had a good 4 days, Adam Gase said. Parker wanted to make more plays in camp, Gase concedes.
Raekwon McMillan and Kiko Alonso have both been involved in pkaycalling this season, Adam Gase said
Raekwon McMillan is making strides, Adam Gase says. Game 2 was better than Game 1.
Adam Gase talks to Kalen Ballage almost every day. He‚Äôs doing a great job at practice. He‚Äôs ready to go if called upon.
Reshad Jones took a positive step today. If his body parts are working he‚Äôll do all he can to be on the field, Adam Gase says.
The Miami Dolphins are 6th in the NFL in yards per rush, 6th in rushing yards per game and 6th in rushing yards. https://t.co/Z1GOh4jIbE
Albert Wilson is 4th in the NFL in yards of separation (4.3) according to NFL Next Gen Stats.
No RB in the NFL spends less time behind the line of scrimmage than Frank Gore of the Miami Dolphins (NFL Next Gen) at 2.35 seconds. He sees the hole and hits it fast.
Ryan Tannehill (2.4 seconds) and Derek Carr (2.41 seconds) are second and fourth in the NFL in time to throw (NFL Next Gen). This should mean fewer sacks on Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium at 1 p.m.
Jakeem Grant ran 20.93 MPH on his 102-yard kickoff return this season. That's the 9th-fastest speed clocked on any run this season (NFL Next Gen)

Miami Dolphins players had been told to expect a restart at 730 pm. Guys had their cleats off, socks off, around 630, and they‚Äôre told to get to the field in 10 minutes.
How do you feel, 7 1/2 hours after kick, Adam Gase? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to go home,‚Äù he said
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve almost covered everything,‚Äù Adam Gase said.

Seven hours later, Miami Dolphins are 1-0, and really, that‚Äôs what matters most.
I asked Reshad Jones this week about what's driving him. "I always feel like I have something to prove," Jones said. "Being a late-round draft pick. This is a show-me league. You have to get it done each and every year." #MiamiDolphins #TWOINTs
Ryan Tannehill: 18-for-24, 213 yards, 2 TD, 112.0 rating #MiamiDolphins

Jakeem Grant told me this week his goal is to make the NFL Hall of Fame. https://t.co/Uu6NkKn0Lq https://t.co/tcqMUK83cI
Miami Dolphins using William Hayes at DT on third downs. Good move.
Walt Aikens and Senorise Perry did a nice job on that Jakeem Grant KOR TD #MiamiDolphins
Jakeem Grant 101 YARDS Kickoff Return Miami Dolphins!
The third quarter is over in Miami - 6 hours and 9 minutes after kickoff. Oh - and it's Dolphins 10, Titans 3.

Marcus Mariota's injury is elbow. Titans also going without OT Taylor Lewan (concussion). Miami must win. Titans w/o QB, LT, RT.

The second lightning delay was 2 hours, 2 minutes. The first lightning delay was 1 hour, 57 minutes. That's 3 hours, 59 minutes we won't eve get back. #MIAatTEN
In Episode 2 of Miami-Tennessee, 1) Reshad Jones intercepted Marcus Mariota 2) Malcolm Butler intercepted Ryan Tannehill on an end zone pass to Mike Gesicki 3 Lightning... Again. We're back for the exciting conclusion - in 10 minutes time.
Dolphins long snapper John Denney has taken the field at Hard Rock Stadium. It‚Äôs all going all right, folks. It‚Äôs all going to be all right.

Another lightning strike pauses the Miami Dolphins game, this time in the second half. Players not happy. Fans booing. I thought we got all the lightning strikes out of the way in 2017.
Ryan Tannehill intercepted, trying for Mike Gesicki on a 2nd-and-goal from the 4. Malcolm Butler read the play all the way. #MIAvsTEN
Rookie Mike Gesicki pumps his right arm and kicks a leg after his first NFL catch from Ryan Tannehill. Sets up a first-and-goal for Miami Dolphins.
There isn't a backup snapper listed on the Miami Dolphins depth chart.
Uh-Oh. Dolphins snapper John Denney has a shoulder injury. The backup snapper used to be Mike Hull but he's on IR.
Jordan Phillips and Bobby McCain were cited for taunting. Actually after the long delay, this place has totally woken up. Hard Rock is rocking.
Andre Branch took out Taylor Lewan at the end of at the end of an interception. Didn't look like the Titans were too happy about it. #MIAvsTEN
The Miami Dolphins fans are all fired up now. Bobby McCain was all fired up on the field. Jordan Phillips was waving his arms with no helmet on. Field covered in yellow flags. #MIAvsTEN

Reader e-mails to say stop writing about Kenny Stills‚Äô protest because ‚Äúhe wants to see his name in the paper.‚Äù Stills caught a TD in first half so I think he‚Äôd make it either way.
A reporter (I can't remember who) asked Gase about lighting delays on Friday. "You just try to keep guys loose and you try to organize. When you get a start time, then you start working backwards and just really get your warmup set," Gase said. Thanks, reporter I can't remember.
Miami Dolphins offense: 27 plays, 13 first downs, 7.0 yards per pass, 7.0 yards per rush. Not a bad first half.

Guys who get too caught up on looking at he depth chart and counting numbers in their room fail - Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase
Adam Gase says Jakeem Grant will have some type of role in this offense
It‚Äôs important to give everybody their fair shot to move up and work against the 1s, for example, Durham Smythe - Adam Gase
You have to prove yourself every single year, Adam Gase says.
MarQueis Gray is reacting, not thinking. Knowing what to do is helpful. He‚Äôs also one of or best special teams players. - Adam Gase
Adam Gase: Mike Gesicki at 5th string I wouldn‚Äôt look too deep into this depth chart.
Adam Gase: Starting RB depends on personnel grouping. They both deserve to play.
Adam Gase: We have 8 guys we can rotate in on that defensive line

Frank Gore is a legend. It's also true that last season he averaged 3.7 yards per carry. In his first two seasons, Kenyan Drake has averaged 5.0 yards per carry. Gore is an excellent addition. If Drake, 24, doesn't emerge as clear starter, that's not good for Miami Dolphins.

Miami Dolphins first 2018 depth chart. What jumps off the page https://t.co/n1oYtTXwVX
David Fales and Brock Osweiler are listed as OR behind Ryan Tannehill. This hot competition will last into and quite possibly through the preseason. https://t.co/n1oYtTXwVX https://t.co/w6xsl7ykoU
Drake is definitely on track to take the majority. But Miami feels Gore can contribute more than some expect. He's looked good. In PPR, though, no doubt Drake should have a lot of catches, too.  #MiamiDolphins #FantasyFootball https://t.co/GIGnM501kg

So far, Tory McTyer has been a top CB performer, Adam Gase says. Unless somebody else has a better day, he'll stay out there.
Adam Gase: Our offensive line should be a STRENGTH this season.
Ja'Wuan James needs to use his experience and really start maximizing what he knows, Adam Gase says.
Adam Gase: Ryan Tannehill is doing a better job of moving on from interceptions.
Adam Gase: DeVante Parker has to be strong. He has to fight off holds. He has to fight for the ball. He has the tools to do all that. He won one today. Didn't get one last time.
Mike Gesicki says he'll walk Ryan Tannehill's dog --&gt; https://t.co/ZyIu3CyieX
Adam Gase: I'm not worried about how much time William Hayes (hamstring) misses in the preseason.
Adam Gase: It's hard for me to say how the new rules will affect the game. There have been only a few plays in practice that would be penalties. See what you hit.
Adam Gase: I haven't told the players if we're live yet at the scrimmage.
Adam Gase: Our scrimmage tomorrow is a dress rehearsal for our preseason games.
Adam Gase: Mike Gesicki is developing chemistry with Ryan Tannehill in the red zone.
Mike Gesicki is going to be a red zone threat. TD corner of end zone from RT17. Gesicki May have 38 catches, but 8 TDs. #FantasyFootball #FantasyFocus #MiamoDolphins

Here‚Äôs what Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase said today https://t.co/t0zo65NS1R https://t.co/sH0yzi2XTx
Adam Gase: Frank Gore looks to me like he did 10 years ago. Gore is the last person I have ever doubted.

Adam Gase: We want to turn Albert Wilson touches into essentially punt returns
Adam Gase: Our DL are going to play less snaps this season.
Adam Gase: Charles Harris work so hard, the sacks will come.
Adam Gase: We know a team we face twice a year (Patriots) uses a three-safety look. Our third safeties can help in run game.
Adam Gase: Jordan Phillips does some things athletically a man of that size can‚Äôt usually do.
Adam Gase: Only thing we need to see from Raekwon McMillan now is what he does on the field. He‚Äôs really smart and an excellent leader.
