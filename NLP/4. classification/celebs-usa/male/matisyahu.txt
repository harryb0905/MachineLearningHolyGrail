Our friend Kekoa Alama, Maui coffee shop bruddah, Will be joining us to sing "One Day" with us on the 08.12 in LA https://t.co/DGFVE2Wyvt
Check out the "Storm Tossed" music video and get the track on iTunes and Spotify today. https://t.co/gyq0Vozfrx
Walked into coffee shop where kid was singing my song and joined him https://t.co/GyjyVPMmlu
https://t.co/NELwGpMlYx
It means too much to me
If I catch myself doing what I'm "supposed" to do,I step back, listen, wait patiently till something real happens.I simply can't fake music
@taryn_hai thank you. I really struggled tonight to catch a vibe. There were a couple cool moments for me but mainly I was searching.
Going to see my princess in a couple days. https://t.co/ojWC4TCGvH

Get your tickets and come out for a great show.  Big thanks to Jeff Crespi for a great picture. https://t.co/8ouAOvKgC8
@TimmyMKE no it doesn't. We play old songs, new songs, hits, improvs. All of it. Just not every night. Played youth like 5 times this tour
@blackknoll haha. Love you bro. We need to make more music soon
Took me a minute to figure that one out. Less is more. depth over everything. Greed comes in many forms. Quality over Quantity.
I'd rather play for 500 people who appreciate and love the music I want to make then 5000 drunk meatheads who want me to be what I'm not
Who cares how many people pay to see your shows if they put pressure on you to be who you aren't. #chopmdown
"Shaving" excess Cultivate the fan base. Not about gaining more fans but about gaining the type of fans I would actually hang with off stage
https://t.co/r6MmMJGcg7
The day I put my business before my  art is the day I make the love of my life a 9 to 5. I don't clock in and out. This my life fo life

I told my kids today that 80% of the people at airports are morons. Is that bad Parenting? Am I being to nice. Should I be more honest?
@kamutsche and I love that you love it. It means you're prob someone i'd actually enjoy hanging out with.
Anyway I'm done with my public therapy session. Thanks for listening. I feel better. Taking a 10 day break before we start up again on east
I'm pretty convinced that over 50% of people that go out to see live music don't really love music they're just looking for something to do.
I love those popular songs as well but there's more there. #keeplistening.
All that being said when I look out and see people singing along to the Less popular songs It strengthens me to continue making #REALMUSIC
These two things literally happened multiple times at everyone of the shows I just played on tour. Honestly I'd rather not take your money.
Ohhh wait this is even better. How about when you play King with out a crown and then 2 songs later someone yells Play King with out a crown
There is nothing more annoying then baring your soul and then having someone yell 'ONEDAY' as if that's the only reason they came to see you
This way I'll actually have fans at my show not just fans of one song. #culitvateyourfanbase
I am thinking about taking one day off the set list. Maybe just play it a couple times a year at special occasions.
@JericaHawkins I have other songs as well. You're the let down.
@Katie_Rose_92 @Giants I'm also a Giant fan!
@jewlicious yes I have. At least twice.
@FutbolDarmian beat it!
@FutbolDarmian take your head out of your ass. #Ignorant

@LegInsurrection thanks for support and bringing this to my attention. Hopefully they're "protest" will only attract more people to the show

Little fun with some of my @Dreampatron "fan club" members. Join today https://t.co/gPQVWubxj3 https://t.co/lwJVxWAsg1
I still love you Bill!!!!
Ok. #RockTheKasbah is officially the third movie I've ever walked out of. I only stayed this long cause I was having fun tweeting.
@kelvinmonoxide everything
@originalYoni never heard of it.
Bill Murray even in the worst movie of all time is still managing to teach me a lesson."We're all human"even your idols make shit sometimes.
It's kind of fun to hang by yourself in a movie theater. No one can bother you while you tweet.
Who's out there? Let's chat? What super hero or villain is each member of the band?
The movie just got even worse. Hahahah. I can't believe how bad it is.It's almost unbelievable. It's so bad it's making me happy! Brilliant!
I wana be QuickSilver for Halloween.Stu should be Night Crawler.@aarondugan is Thor.Tim is Hulk and @robmarscher is Super Man.Weneedcostumes
Thank God there's no one in this theater so I can tweet instead of watching this movie. https://t.co/dMq7t8jzhj
@Lauriefanelli @NSCPAS @axs thanks for the great review of last nights show.
@psugator02 exactly. It's sooooooo bad.
@LehmanCg6lehman I loved life-aquatic. Master piece.
Every time I think this movie can't get any worse it does. 5 more min. Then it goes on the list of three movies I've walked out on.
Only one in the theater. #RockTheKasbah. Soooooooo bad. I never thought it would be possible to not like Bill Murray.

@VidaDeFortuna books have been written saying less then some tweets.
@VidaDeFortuna no you got it backwards. So much can be said in 140
"Anyone can be a drunk. Nah takes special talent. Endurance. Endurance is greater then truth."
"What was all that about? Miss directed animosity"
"That's was nothing but dumb luck mothafucka. ...yeah but that counts too!"
Gonna tweet all the golden gems of this movie I'm watching
@clockworkelf1 @DBolelli was gonna ask you the same question.
@asvpxspency @Drake sure. Let him know.
"Who are you? Ahhh the eternal question. And the eternal answer. I don't know." Bar stool 1987. Good TV on at this hour.
@VidaDeFortuna ok you start.
@tomasson57 it's about to be that time for me too.
@originalYoni go to karlin in borough park or toldos Aaron in Williamsburg.
@originalYoni 100% serious.
@YourPaidRequest you know it!
Your tweets are doing the trick. Thanks. Haha
@YourPaidRequest sounds sketchy
@originalYoni go to a super chassidish Shul where they scream at God. That should work.

I just want to say I don't know what happened to @TrueDetective this season. What happened? @RayDonovan_SHO is my new hero
@lilianatamayo_ seriously?
@davidgross_man how did you like the Akeda record? That record is my heart and soul.
@davidgross_man wish I would have been less into the sandwich and more into you during our interview. Perhaps we can chat again sometime
@davidgross_man anyway David regardless I still enjoyed your article and the perspective of a modern orthodox intellectual kid on matisyahu
Interesting to me that you and some couldn't find the spiritual content in those songs. Funny how people equate Pop music with shallowness
@davidgross_man are you aware that the entire spark seeker album is based on bal Shem tov chassidut and Light was based on nachmans 7begers?
@davidgross_man just read your article you wrote on me in tablet as it was mentioned in a google alert for an upcoming show.

@maxolivares3 I remember the recording session. It was right around when my son laivy was born. It reminds me of my youth.
@MISTERMORT YOU! How's my NYC?
@shuaros I really feel that on small stages especially. It feels like there is a microscope up to your insides and everyone is looking in.
The search for real joy, truth and the still small voice continues tonight in Hungry! More bass!
Thanks ya'll. It's always the dicks that are the most outspoken.  I needed the love. I'm hugging you all now. Tonight in Hungry!
@MarkDelaney89 done!

@LehmanCg6lehman I'm sensitive dude. You chill.
@shuaros I like that.
@C_Rayz_Walz what up G? Don't let me slip on releasing that track we did together for AKEDA. SOON COME!
@TheVulcanator hahahaha. You guys are making me feel better lol.
@AmyEnduring hell yes. I had 50 kids up on stage. It almost collapsed.
@MarkDelaney89 that's a valid complaint.
Downs of life and then expressing those full range of emotions through music then I want you at my concert. We can lift each other.
If you want to special guests and fake smiles don't come to a Matisyahu show. If you want to see a real person going through the ups and ...
Authenticity. Don't try and pretend to feel when you don't. I never fake it. This way when we feel it, we feel it together.
My number one goal during a show is authenticity. I approach each show where I am. Then I try and let the music ignite me.
Someone just complained that I didn't say hello enough to the audience at my concert in Munich. That i didn't have any special guests.
4:30 am in Vienna. Can't sleep and my wifi is working. Hello out there.

@shuaros @RedScareBot @SidKaas @UofPurim hahaha
@SidKaas @shuaros @UofPurim very communist of you.
@paulanoelmacfie yep
@rachypeachy I can only imagine
@shuaros I guess I should know that. I walked dogs on 72nd st and Brdwy all through college.
@shuaros @UofPurim it's all good brother. My Torah is much stronger in my music then if I were to try and teach.
@rachypeachy I don't support any one organization. I deal more with people on the individual basis. I support people not groups.
@shuaros @UofPurim what's UWS?
@EsTherTjj_ not bad. Heading to Ghent soon.
@rachypeachy financially?
@go2Leib happy birthday to the one and only!!!!
@go2Leib though I don't think he was going for the "hair" cut I am.
@go2Leib ahhhhh. Yes. Seeee my neshama is holding.
@shuaros @UofPurim where is that?
@go2Leib huh?
@Kryssy_With_a_Y I have plans to come back to everywhere I have been.
@JoshSShamrock no problem. I'm a confused 35 year old trying to find myself. We are in it together.
@GiantRobot494 fat bob with a 2 in 1 Vance and Hines pipe and a ton of dope ass engine work!!!
@Tyler_Tzadok well this was a written freestyle. Kind of a cross blend
@JoshSShamrock sometimes you gotta let go of something in order to have it for real. Its a process. You have your whole life to live it.
@paulanoelmacfie so many things
@GiantRobot494 someone stole mine! Arghhhh!
@mujernica777 sure. Hi
@JoshSShamrock I don't believe faith is something one should or shouldn't have. It's nice if you have it but it's not a ? Of right or wrong
@JoshSShamrock its good to be unsure. One should be unsure of everything especially the things they tell you, you should be sure of.
@YoeyTurkel @phish let me come up and sing avenu malkenu.
@PhillthyG Ahhh. That makes sense but not an easy one to give up.
@JoshSShamrock mainly listen and then just do it.
@shuaros @phish I really wanted to go to the bend shows and take my daughter to her first show but I got a gig. Gotta make the donuts
@ReichardLuis they're awesome! Thanks
And sorry for blowing up your twitter feed but I haven't tweeted in a minute so I figured I have some leeway.
The sun is now up so the late night banter is currently early morning banter. Just clarifying.

@shinjorocks @AshCohn @herringaide Ahhh yes. Haven't has that particular struggle.
@HeebrewHammer exactly
@SFOLHR it's not always that way. Sometimes I get restless. Are you a flight attendant?
@shinjorocks how much?
@slimkailz what do you mean? It sucks.
@kandknowles we can go through this day together. We'll make it!
@w_vern no sill. getting rid of hicups

@Shmuelb gut Yom Tov
@Katheren8 I watched all of the current @LouieFX season in one sitting. He's one of the hidden 36 rightous men of our generation.
@mawanji13 @clangCLong89 not sure but I'm sure it's more enjoyable with a friend.
@Tyler_Tzadok one can do whatever they please. There are no rules like that anymore.
@The_Jaybird love that
@SFOLHR you know, I got my status! literally slept from take off to touch down.
@Tyler_Tzadok you want bars, I got more bars then a mitzvah. More bars then shvitz in the armpits of college kids on frat row in IBIza
It worked! IT REALLY WORKED. MY HICUPS ARE GONE
@KahloCohenFM I like your tweets
@Krol_Pichardo not sure
@Shmuelb looks like Amsterdam. Of course.
@Spensersbomb forgiven
@IanSaysSo I'll never forget warrior vs hulk. I was in 4th grade I think. Pay per view!
@ReichardLuis RANGERS ALL THE WAY BABY
@ldwarka this breath swallow thing seems to be working. I love social media.

@Spensersbomb tried calling. Your phone went straight to voicemail. WTF?! Thanks for playing. Good day.
@matisyahu you're getting close. Do not give up in the final moments. My final hint. Feliz cumplea√±os
@Spensersbomb wonka bar... I like the sea you're swimming in. But remember, when trekking up north don't disturb the wombat
@Spensersbomb damnit Spenser, you are being to literal. Remember, the visionary mystic is on the purple hill, not in the creme brulee.
@originalYoni #boomisdead  Next boom gets blocked. I'm not fuckin' around.
@Spensersbomb I haven't given up on you yet Spense! It may or may not rhyme with apple sauce, and shares similar essential qualities
@Spensersbomb look Spencer, you're completely off track. You're out if control. Pull it together bro!
@madeforthelove @Jessy6618 embrace the inner squeal.
@matisyahu the password has six syllables...
@originalYoni warmer
@Spensersbomb I meant what I said
@Spensersbomb sorry. Not Greek.
@Spensersbomb sorry to lead you astray, it has nothing to do with fruit of any kind. This is bigger than fruit.
@Spensersbomb what kind?
@madeforthelove I'm glad you like the song... Not a password...please try again

Due to some crazy thunder we had to stop early but fear not We are aiming to start at ten @ the boot
Shittiest travel day of all time? Quite possibly. Happy to be at Tarmac in NYC.
Spent 3 days in my hotel. Finally about to leave to head to festy. Starting to feel a little wacky. Hahaha #visionquest
Getting nostalgic watching old you tube clips. Like summerfest 2008.
@PebblesnRox thank you. That lyric resonates strong.
@taylordeupree @blackknoll this is awesome. Thank you
@jonbellion nice work homey!
@Arq_be not anymore. Hello to you.
@JERICOENT god no
@zoharrm you would make a great politician I'm sure. Enjoy that.
@zoharrm STOP.
@Mclem25 sucks for you!
@zoharrm you are annoying
@Tyler_Tzadok say a prayer for yourself homey. It'll prob work better.
@zoharrm okeey dokey
@Tyler_Tzadok good luck. You can run but you can't hide
@zoharrm you're depressing me.
@zoharrm ok. Whatever you say babe.
@ghittsum maybe god wants to be more casual. Maybe he's sick of being held in reverence and just wants to be treated normal. Like a friend.
@ghittsum blah blah blah.
@Tyler_Tzadok enjoy the maze
@Bridgeeeex3 ok. But only cause you say so.
@Mclem25 maybe he is more humble and prefers god. Its amazing how we project onto him. Who knows what he wants? Only him. I am what I am
@Mclem25 who cares? Capitalize don't capitalize. You think he cares whether you capitalized his English name on twitter. Grow up. Lol
@shimblum you are a fool. Thank you for the entertainment and now you are officially blocked. Jerk.
@shimblum thanks for pointing out what I did as if I didn't know being that I DID IT.  One more comment from you and you're going to timeout
@Mclem25 whatever. You get the point.
@Tyler_Tzadok its abkut to. Leaving the solitude of my room to enjoy a fruit plate with @officialdubtrio and David Serber.
@shimblum everything you say is in the form of telling me what to do. Even this last one. Do you know the term pedantic? Look it up.
@zoharrm the worst thing in the world is when someone asks you, "is everything ok". Is everything supposed to be ok?
@shimblum why are you stating back what I already stated as if I didn't know it already. Argh. Annoying.
@KerBearSays so are you for even mentioning that shit. Who said anything abkut that. Beat it!
@shimblum I hate when people tell me what to do. Find yours!
Moments I live for: when I'm on stage singing to god about how real the darkness feels and then poof, it releases. Fuck all the bullshit
Sometimes my moods get soooo heavy. Peace to all the bi polar people out there. I sing for the struggling and broken hearted.
@KerBearSays you're the winner of saying the first stupid thing since I got on twitter ten minutes ago. Congrats!
He was in the form of an Asian woman and he said, a little bit of beauty dispels a lot if ugliness.
Once I had a dream about the rebbe where we took a taxi into manhattan together from 770...
Just had a dream I was singing tzama l'col nafshi and it got super cosmic. Happy Yud Alef Nissan.
What should I do in Guatemala City tonight for Yud Aleph Nissan?
@EddieEriksson3 dope
Just got down here to Guatemala City for the #EmpireMusicFestival #EMF2015
@ActionBronson is my new twitter hero. I love how he handles fools. Damn I miss NYC!
I am currently somewhere in New Hampshire. I think I used to wash dishes at summer camp near here.
My fav part of @ActionBronson perf on letterman is when Dave says his name at the end and he goes, "that's me"!
Listening to @ActionBronson on plane to NY via @stanipcus. Good looks my man. Lovin it!
My boys are having a spitball fight at the kosher restaraunt: Roll and float, roll and float, roll and float. My new mantra for life.
At swimming class with son. He was freaking out and then they did "roll and float" and all was good. I'm gonna remember that one for life!
@SonLittleMusic haha. You're a legend bro. The ep is in full rotation! Respect! Get at me!
@La_Evanlution nope. I am 100% sober for almost 3 months now. Just plain old sober tweets. That's what makes them awesome.
Them out, it brings me much joy. As did that quesadilla.
Isn't so bad, then I overpayed the babysitter cause I had no change. Oh well. I've started to say Namaste to people instead of cursing
A parking lot, then I drove home with my favorite dude David and processed, then I realized that I am missing two things in my life. Which
@M_Simpson8 I went to see @WidespreadPanic @LAOrpheum, then I lost my temper with a tripping idiot, then I had a quesadilla, then I peed in
@SonLittleMusic I was just thinking the same about you. Was gonna give you a couple more days first though. Great fucking music though!
Good eeeeevening. I say that with a Count Dracula drawl.
Make a wish
Up early. Gotta get back to LA for my boys hockey games. Laivy playing goalie today! Shalom is a beast! Ironic.
@DrewGarner2 thanks man
@hillaryannedant you're welcome!
Listening to @Mavado_Gully before I go on. Shit gets me pumped.
Reviewing lyrics side stage. Been a minute. #deathtosetlists
Bout to hit the stage in mobile Alabama. Wires making some funky noises.
@8452262557 happy birthday babe.
There must be some kind if spiritual connection though. Some reason why they're linked beyond chance.
@amaditalks ahhhh. Thanks
@YACSydney definately you should do more then one good deed. You can do better my friend.
@amaditalks is that where the term fucking like rabbits comes from?
@ohmygodfrey32 my original Hebrew name is fivish Hershel which can be translated as bright deer. And yes we are on nickname basis.
@Snshn4u hahaha. That's funny. Well played sir.
I have ?  What do bunnies and eggs have to do with Jesus' death. Just curious.
@Snshn4u from now on I will tweet you and only you every single time I need to pee. Starting with right now.
Ahhh. That was wonderful. Its 2am. Good night.
Just gonna pee first and then check my tweets when I get back and then go to bed.
Really going to bed now. I promise. See you in my dreams.
@Spensersbomb you are sincerely welcome
@Neftali_Marley if you don't like it then don't do it.
@daniwulfbassman don't tell me to stay working. Blessed love
@cmclame don't ask simple questions.
@koshadillz @Nas @BustaRhymes prob not. Hip hop shows usually bore me. I can't remember the last one I saw that didn't.
@Lohem you have renewed my faith in twitter for the time being. And to everyone else I love you anyway. Good night moon.
@Lohem you didn't ask me about tour dates or my beard or a ? that a bad reporter would ask. Thanks. I knew one of you existed.
@Lohem you weren't antagonizing or kissing my ass. You didn't speak just hear yourself or ask me an obvious ?
@Lohem you are the winner! Mazel Tov! Can we be friends?
@ladyofhero thanks. I hope so.
@Yishai613 I plugged in.
@koshadillz you do enough "mobbing out" for us all.
@cmclame it ain't that simple duuuuude.
@Neftali_Marley music genres can not be defined. They are always changing and are made of combinations of different genres to begin with.
@Neftali_Marley you mean the shake off the dust version? Reggae means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
@nickrice23 yes I realize. Thanks for clearing things up. I wasn't going to able to sleep.
1%.
@ed_schwab you must be one of the nine people who has bought tickets so far. I'm basically coming for you.
@GetRevelator what does that mean?
@Serena_Isaac oh I thought it was a Halloween costume or something.
@nickrice23 well hanging out with your parole officer isn't what's gonna do it.
@skoolboy32 nope
@pud not yet dad. I still have 3%. Maybe you should get to sleep.
@pisilota its better not to know what to think. It makes you smarter.
@Spensersbomb when will fools stop asking about it? There are a lot of unknowns out there. Get used to it.
@Mr_Stoloro when I get paid to fly a long fucking way from home. Long plane rides suck.
@Neftali_Marley I don't think you've heard the original version. Only a few people have. It exists on one cd that only I own.
@Lohem hahahaha. You're funny. They should put a ban on those fucking things.
@LaDY_DaWN hollllllllllla
@CrackedWombat blow me. How's that for light. Hahaha
@PSNztstyle boring! You can do better.
@nickrice23 Moshe held the flame cause he 'was drawn from the water' greatness only sticks to the humble.
@linagato @rosemaryjane09 I already told you. Fund that shit yourself. Record company never payed me back for the videos I made already.
@Kyle__Riker yes
@isaurral11 I love that your screenshot is you looking spiritually over a mountain. Hahja hahahaha
@isaurral11 you're 12?
@isaurral11 thank you. Gays are the best!
@Serena_Isaac why is your friend so pale?
@nickrice23 weird but awesome. I'll pass.
@jack_chinchilla blessed love.
@jonktheexplorer Mazel Tov!
@musicjnkie what's that?
@alvarorugby good day sir
@KackieJenney 11%
@Spensersbomb it comes back all the time.
@Zipcut @blakemharris why in gods name would you think that. Are you projecting?
@cmclame I post tour dates. This is not for that. This is for schmoozing.
@daniwulfbassman you're not a sad fool. You are a wise fool. Think hard about that one, then spin around 30 times, and drink some juice
@CrackedWombat who cares? Besides you that is?
@pisilota I rarely understand your tweets.
@nickrice23 who said that. Not me. He is not a great Jew just a good rapper. Very different. In my humble opinion.
@Spensersbomb ok. Maybe.
@Lohem yeah fuck travel toothbrushes. I'm done with m'. Back to my real heavy duty electric shit. This was just an experiment.
@Spensersbomb I'm pretty sure I remember that moment.
@rosemaryjane09 bout to go shoot another video in a couple weeks for reservoir. I still want to shoot one for sick for so long.That's my fav
@Zipcut @blakemharris you know this man.
@settledownkayla nice. I'm glad to hear you've grown up. I've got 4 kids and i haven't grown up yet. Be careful! Don't grow up just grow!
@KackieJenney haaaaaaayyyyy
@quipsandqueries Xoxox
@Boringgirlstory nothing. I don't tweet and listen at the same time.
@Reluctant_H3RO I don't know and it doesn't matter cause that will never be the case. #Whywasteimeonthinkingaboutthingsthatwillneverhappen
@blakemharris @aarondugan @officialdubtrio @robmarscher
@ladyofhero nice. Do it!
@settledownkayla don't be so sure. Lol
@PSNztstyle pass
@blakemharris I'm a fan of some sports like hockey, football, and lacrosse.
This travel toothbrush is pissing me off! http://t.co/r6zSgCWjFk

@saboner91 Mazel Tov!
@kanesnextmove I just did. Psycho telepathically. Happy birthday home girl.
If you don't like my music then don't listen to it. It's not like you paid for it anyway.
I'm cultivating my fan base right now. Weeding out the dip shits. Blessed love to the non judgemental.
@CrackedWombat we'll do it together bro. Blessed love.
@AlexandreRighi because you don't know your ass from your elbow. Take a hike.
@yezzayahu yes. Yes it was. I still love you.
@Murray21234 and yes I'll be back. Haven't I played in Milwaukee every year since 2004. That's 16 years why would this year be different?
@Murray21234 not this again. I played for over an hour. It wasn't cut short the moniters failed at the begining of the show.
@jeffvolkmer why would you be sorry to hear that I am 58 days sober. Your supposed to say congratulations! Wait don't answer.
@__MarrrciaH happy birthday!

@AyOHmusic what do you know about street cred? Just listened to your music. Its fuckin wack!
By the way I've decided not to hold back on twitter anymore. When people ask me dumb things I'm gonna speak my mind. Starting with This dude
@AyOHmusic I just finished touring with them in dec. We did about 60shows in 63 days. Where were you?Why are you asking me stupid questions?
@Wil120mm @reddit that's a dumb question. Because I fucking love Israel. If you don't then go suck on a lemon. Hahaha. I crack myself up
I took more selfies today with fans then... Then I don't know what.
@RachelBrynien1 today I am 58 days 100% sober. Thank you for your concern and support.
@DanZaitsev1 no cow bells a the staples center and the @LAKings have plenty of stars but they still play hockey not feed the star
@DanZaitsev1 looked more like a basketball game then a hockey game. And the guy in front of me with his damn cow bell almost made me deaf
@DanZaitsev1 he doesn't pass the puck. I saw him take like 7 shots in a row and miss them all. And the rest of his team just feeds him...
Spent whole ride from Baltimore airport to DC unfollowing. Its fun like cleaning for pesach.
I realized that I never check my twitter feed cause there's so many messages I'm overwelmed. I now follow like 4 people.
Anyone who tweeted about @justinbieber 's birthday today I stopped following. #trimmingthefat and that's like more then half

Last quote was from #mikeeigan
One way that faith goes beyond belief is by enabling unknown transformations thatopenreality,transformationswemay sensebutareunabletopinDown
"Faith is deeper then belief. Belief often functions as premature organization, closure if faith.

It is heartbreaking to read the news that the bodies of Eyal, Gilad and Naftali were found today. There are no words to describe the
heartache, and no emotion big enough to comfort their families and loved ones. May their memories be a blessing, may they rest in peace,
and may we all try to give a bit more love, kindness, and positivity today to overcome the hole left by there absence.

Ladies and gents, here is the first track I want to share with you from my new record, #Akeda https://t.co/tabAMk8rt2
Thank you
To you my core fans. I wanted to start with a direct message to the ones I knew would be listening closely. The ones who keep me going...
Just as a heads up. This first song is not one day or sunshine. It is a deeply personal song that I specifically choose to release first...
Am
Song goes up at 9:30pacific
@swedmau5 tell me if you find out. The answer is the question.
@mysan2010 it is a prayer we say to God for allowing us to reach a new occasion. This is my version of that prayer.
@stanipcus YES! My main man Stan is tuned in!
And @robmarscher who played keys with me for several years.
It features @aarondugan my long time friend and original guitar player from live at Stubbs.
Erev Shabbes, Parsha Para is quite appropriate.
It speaks directly to God, my brothers and sisters, my fans and anti/fans. It is a prayer. My Shehechianu.
So excited I couldn't sleep! This first song means sooo much to me.
@mightymous100 hahaha
It's the intro song to the record, called "reservoir". More coming soon...  Very soon.
Releasing the first song off Akeda in a couple hours. Enjoy!
