Breakfast with @latimesfarmer this AM, been a friend since his first day in LA, and an awesome sportswriter on all things NFL!
Reading Deloitte annual review of football (soccer), the kaka and ronaldo xfers render this outdated, but a great read, kudos to dan jones.

@lauren2go Welcome to the Twitter bandwagon!  It's about time...
Crazy that Balsille can't get a team...tried to buy 3, 2 of whom are in serious trouble...isn't he the kind of owner every league wants?
Tons of chatter from last tweet, NBC folks, my cynicism didn't sit well...my apologies to Ebersol, I admire him too much to offend him.
NBC buys rights to PFT content...seems like a convenient way for them to be able to sensor what gets published and be nice to the NFL.
@PlatinumFitness No drains yet, but the night is young!!!
50 miles, big climbs...@platinumfitness might have gotten his heartrate to 100, me on the otherhand, redlined the whole way!
New climb today, yerba buena here we come...and odd to read the papers in the AM and realize you read it all the nite before on web, free!
@richeisen Saw it last night, I so agree...I need to see it again!
Moussavi has to get 75% of real vote to have chance of winning this election against Ahmadinejad, hard to steal that many votes for anyone.
Game 7's in any sport are so great to watch...I get a strange feeling the Pens are going to win this one.
St. Jude (formely Stanford) Classic PGA event this week, fascinating article  on the Stanford swindle in Vanity Fair...what does the SEC do?
http://bit.ly/wk343  And you thought European soccer was confusing...this is a good explanation of how Brazilian soccer works.
Would be ironic if Iranian people got rid of Ahmadinejad by voting when US and Israel thought the military was the only way
Just got word my Kindle DX shipped, I am sure all the newspaper publishers are breathing a sigh of relief...or not.
@PlatinumFitness Looking forward to it!
@PlatinumFitness Awesome workout today, I can take it, keep bringing it...
I love all the people talking about the economy getting better, if they are so smart why didn't they see how bad it was going to get...

Kindergarten graduation, not sure there is anything cuter in the whole world!!!
