In San Diego last night @pennjillette and I were tickled by a backstage visit from wonderful music-makers @RealTocaRivera and @jason_mraz. https://t.co/wZwb3Nq7le
I feel like I'm in two places at once.  Even as we start to shoot the new season, last season is making another round. https://t.co/lOZw0HdzB7
You might know clue 58 across in the February 20th New York Times crossword puzzle.
My recently acquired-then-rapidly-married-off daughter @bigbangtheory @missmayim came to the @riolasvegas show and visited backstage with her family (including 2 very astute sons). https://t.co/BzNvuzxFzN
Hey, we're the punch line. https://t.co/xWzQUsPvBl
"Bullshit" fans:  Here's a cool resource, a complete listing of everything BS that @pennjillette and I did.  https://t.co/LXf7QZ1cql
Magic fans might enjoy knowing about @wkalush, the key person in one of the outstanding magic resources in the world.  https://t.co/Si8Q0jbYNu
@suade99 @ClubbingTimes3 Perhaps it was:  when I had just completed one of my first shows there, and was about to go into my collecting-money-from-the-audience bit, when a troop of bagpipers marched directly through (and dissipated) my crowd. @pennjillette laughed so hard....
I've kind of got chills going up my spine.  A longstanding fan named his son Teller.  He's now 11 and I met him with his dad for the first time after the show tonight.  What a total honor and joy.  Now I have to live up to my name.  Here we are:  Teller and Teller. https://t.co/aQl1grNh6J

@WendyBirdOZ @pennjillette Thanks, Wendy!
@SirOwenDisney @pennjillette @hardrockliveorl We do our post show stuff separately to allow more flexibility and individual contact.  Otherwise it gets too stiff and stilted -- I dislike lines and step-and-repeat formalities.  But if you strike exactly the same pose with each, you could photoshop the two pictures together...
@ClubbingTimes3 Wow.  Honored to be on your person.
@esq_rr @pennjillette It's not really graciousness.  We just love doing it.  I wonder why more performers don't.  Perhaps it's just that we have exceptionally wonderful fans.
@SirOwenDisney @hardrockliveorl @pennjillette @shecky71 would know.  But if you don't hear from him, I'd bring cash.
Your place (https://t.co/oTqV7oyrqz) is amazing -- like a natural history museum where guests can buy the exhibits. I'm using something cool I got there onstage in a new bit called, "Glass Portrait."  @pennjillette paid half. https://t.co/jWRqWYLX03
Aargh.  So sorry.  Be assured that we cancel shows only when absolutely necessary, and we try and notify folks as best we can.  We'll try and be there for you next time. https://t.co/8TveNEiS1V
When we arrive at FLA airports five guys show up in Baggage Claim with 20-30 photos for us to sign. They have the pictures all neatly laid out for signature and fresh markers to sign with. I imagine they're autograph dealers, but who cares?  I'm honored somebody wants 'em.
My friend @_Projectonelife, he of the dancing-with-people-around-the-world video, just released this little story of Chicago in nicer weather.  https://t.co/q8VaGlL2j5

@RioVegas and @CaesarsEnt presented @pennjillette and me with another amazing anniversary cake for 18 years at the P&amp;T Theater.  Note that the neckties on the cake match our ties and that the little bits on top of the chained chest are chopped up carrots and fingers. https://t.co/0La19twxdg
@amateurrun @pennjillette Depends on the show.  I often hang and chat for a little while.  But I never go out after shows.  That’s for a different era of my life.
Denny has been a great asset to magic and magicians.  And a kind and generous man.  Time for us to give back. https://t.co/W5WSc3NPcj
Haha!  Who knows? https://t.co/WDIiNjNH3x
Tomorrow, Saturday, January 5th will mark 18 years of @pennjillette and me at @RioVegas.  Vegas and @CaesarsEnt has been very kind to us and our fans from all over the world, even kinder.  I'm planning on at least another 18.  Love to all.
In spite of the critical praise it is getting, and in spite of its cultural sensitivity and “slice of life” structure, and in spite of its stunning cinematography, ROMA is a damn fine flick.
No argument from me, I assure you. https://t.co/Ui89LAdOMd
@BigLou_22 @pennjillette Excellent!!!  I am noticing more and more young women embracing magic and it makes me very happy.
@mertonfreij @pennjillette @GeneseeTheatre Gosh, we'd better be good!
@TheZackKennedy @ROYALMagicBrand @pennjillette Au contraire!  USE one of the tricks, but come up with a variation with a new ending.  That way we smugly watch, expecting not to be fooled, then you turn our expectations inside out.  That's what fools us most of the time.
@martinw17 @pennjillette A good age to start in on magic, I'd say.  Robert-Houdin was just under 40 when he began doing his famous shows in Paris.
Last night brought @tim_cook and his family and friends to the P&amp;T show.  We were a little irked that CellFish (the phone in the fish) wasn't in this lineup, so that Tim could see a P&amp;T placement of Apple products. https://t.co/NlphKDKblN

@WendyBirdOZ I don't think we'll be able to.  Most of the cast is Chicago based.  Incidentally, we actually originated THE TEMPEST in Vegas, then later took it to Boston, CA, and Chicago.
See anything that @mischiefcomedy makes.  It's all wonderful. https://t.co/mgu1UELi1v
Chicago is a great theater city.  We're so grateful for the recognition.  A lot of great creative and technical people poured their hearts into this show and the audience understood and loved the show. https://t.co/YAoXo4yE69
@WendyBirdOZ @jgp700 @pennjillette Ah, he will in a new bit we're prepping for next season.
@kristianleth I sure would love that.  He's a wonder with a style all his own.  I'd be confident he'd fool me.
@sieler Sure.  I don't think this will be a big part of our stage repertoire, but always eager to learn.  Send them to autographrequests@penn-teller.com.  Thank you.

@pennjillette sent me this, about one of the first women who had her own show as a major star.  Yes, she started as Alexander Herrmann's co-star, but when he died, she took the helm -- with no compromises.   https://t.co/NUfjDfbAzD
As much fun as that Big Bang was, when I walked in the door of the P&amp;T theater at the Rio, I was so happy to be where I really belong, getting ready to go onstage with @pennjillette, doing the things that matter to us.
Just got back from Warner Bros. Studios.  Spent the last two days playing Amy's father, Larry Fowler, opposite Kathy Bates as Amy's mother @bigbangtheory.  The love and care they put into 22 minutes of comedy is amazing.  "They polish it like a diamond," Kathy said.

@lvarado_m Hahaha.  Yup.  No mistakes.  Hey, it's our show.  So I guess whatever we do is right.  Hahahaha.
Also, the next time you come to the Rio, you'll see how @shecky71 got the whole place really handsomely trimmed out.  It really looks like our home, with spiffy signage, extra nice lobby features, and a stage picture that is really harmonious.
Thanks for all the good wishes.  I have to thank here Burt Boyette and our amazing crew for the incredible rehearsal today.  It was orchestrated to perfection.  Every crew member not working backstage was out in the theater playing the roles of audience participants.
Today's rehearsal went very well, but I'm sure glad we did it.  I forgot a few things here and there, but my savvy crew caught every mistake.  By the way, without a back brace the whole show is a lot more fun for me.
We haven't done a show in almost two months.  So in preparation for re-opening on Saturday, we're doing a full run-through with tech tomorrow (Friday) afternoon.  Should be interesting to see how much we remember -- and how much the doves remember, too. https://t.co/iiksbtXXVP
This is a key phenomenon in Tim Jenison's argument that the human eye is not an accurate light meter. https://t.co/VjsFfcXtTw

@LewisKelly25 Yup.  Oops, I spoke.  Well, typed.
@jspafford @CW11Seattle @pennjillette Better eyes than mine, @jspafford!  Gotta keep in mind that the show seats us at a viewing angle &amp; distance designed to maximize the guy's chance to fool us.  It was a legit fool.  And I really, really enjoyed it.  Heck, we get fooled infrequently enough.  Let me enjoy it!
My pal Latin teacher pal Penny Cipolone sent this short but inspiring article about a cop who gets through to suspects by doing card tricks for them.  What a crazy psychological phenomenon:  https://t.co/Y85QUyWGJ4
Just letting you all know, my back surgery was an even bigger success than I'd expected.  Ten days later, I'm taking walks in the neighborhood, exercising lightly, and having -- well -- maybe the most relaxing vacation I've had in a decade.  Love from the neon desert!

By the way, yesterday when I arrived with Laura at the front door of the hospital at 6 a.m.(yipes), my brilliant stage manager, Burt, greeted me stunning in a summer dress and radiant smile, and after the surgery presented me with Great Tomsoni get-well bear, complete with doves! https://t.co/pj6dpBbfN3
@idahands @pennjillette I'll give thanks directly to Dr. Derek Duke -- @drspinez -- whose ingenuity, art and hands did the work in the operating room.  So fortunate to have him and his brilliant team here in Las Vegas.  Duke's got only one twitter post, but you might want to send him a fan note.
@WendyBirdOZ @YouTube @pennjillette @questlove -- in addition to being one of the best musicians on earth -- is about the most delightful audience a person could want for a bit of trickery.

@LunaWheaton How did you find out?  Nobody was supposed to tell...!
Funny, those back problems started around 16 years ago...I wonder.... https://t.co/6xtyaOyAqm
Seven hours after the surgery, the physical therapy people had me take a lovely walk up and down the hall.  No problem at all.  I dined on glazed carrots, salad, and parmesan crusted tilapia. No phones in it, alas.
Surgery all done.  Went perfectly. I’m groggy but happy.  Penn is here and and gave me a  beautiful watch, sweetly inscribed. Glenn, too  and Laura. Hurray!
While I'm lounging in a recuperative bed, I guess I'll also be having fun watching foolers trying to fool us again!  Will they do it?  Watch and find out. https://t.co/27tVeJM5Wv
Lovely article about our friend @derek_del's quest to have magic serve larger ideas.  It's a quest that we share.  We used to call magic "the m-word," and we denied we did a magic show.  But nowadays, people know what we're up to.  So we don't sweat it.   https://t.co/ILbyrw5pWn
@GTPeach @pennjillette You're all so very kind. Thanks for understanding.  We'll be back with a spring in our step on August 18th.  Oh, and there's a ton of cool new material going in very soon after we pick up again.
In our entire prior career, I think we've had to cancel only four shows on short notice.  So I (and much of our crew) feel disoriented and befuddled -- as if we're in one of those showbiz nightmares where you can't find your way back to the stage in time for the next cue.
My sincere apologies to our fans in Biloxi and folks who were planning on seeing the Vegas show. Last night during the show my back firmly ordered me to cut the crap and get it fixed. So I'm stopping work from today till August 18th and getting my back surgery pronto.  Love -T.

"But 'tis strange: And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths, Win us with honest trifles, to betray's In deepest consequence."  I think of this quote from MACBETH whenever I vote.
@EEFWW What stunning photos of the pigeons!
@ElizabethAWhite @tannensmagic Oh, yes, it was a fun place.  Similar, but more strange and colorful was the Flosso-Hornmann company, run by the Coney Island magician Al Flosso and later his son Jackie.  A mad mishmash of props that the merry proprietors would dig through.  Once met Dunninger there.
I'm always amazed and flattered to hear @pennjillette and me mentioned in other shows.  Thanks, Laura, for this heads-up. https://t.co/Sd36ELc7y0

My friend Dr. Ricardo Rosenkrantz invited me to speak to his medical students who are interested in magic.  Even first year students encounter anti-vaxers (yipes!). Rosenkranz is also about to open a medicine-themed new magic show:  https://t.co/OCmZyA9Ouq

It's always nice to be on a 10-best list with @pennjillette. https://t.co/zknE5gIJOv
@gambit201 My brain's a bit occupied for picking just now, but, the central trait of magic is the theatrical collision of what you believe you see with what believe you know.  There are many other elements, but without that, it's not magic.
@magicalmarc I'd love to have more time to travel.  But it may end up being a smaller part of my life than I'd anticipated, because I had the amazing good luck to get the joy -- and responsibility -- of doing all this crazy showbiz stuff.
@WendyBirdOZ Thanks to you, I just did.  Windy and in competition with the Vegas strip, but glittering like bits of mica.
@crash_lo Very flattered to hear it!
Forgive my presumption, but I believe if you're a fan of jazz or P&amp;T, you'll absolutely love this.  It's @pennjillette's and @Jonesjazz's new album of the jazz set they play before the P&amp;T show in Vegas (with my loving liner notes).  https://t.co/9iBTwRVyqH https://t.co/83kHRG7mwy
The producers of “Fool Us” out on the town for some recreation on a rainy night.  But they just can’t shake us. https://t.co/GoiN8CqwkL
The quality of the magic we're seeing on "Fool Us" is simply breathtaking.  With more original effects, more methods we're never seen the like of (ut-oh), and more brilliant female magicians who are coming from all over the world..

If you're coming to @pennjillette and @MrTeller tonight, strap on your seat belts!  We'll be doing 3 new tricks - 2 never seen before ("Street Magic" and "Trust"), and one ("Misdirection") with a nutty new staging.
@RockeyClayton @pennjillette A lot to tell in a mere 4.5 hours.  Maybe a series...
@SteveWalkerJr82 @pennjillette - My favorite is always the newest thing we’ve birthed.  It makes the other tricks jealous.
@RussCeccola @EmilyJillette @RioVegas @pennjillette — Yum.
@kajunklown @RioVegas @pennjillette — That’s just Vegas.  We’ve beein working together for 42+ years.
@Deborahlyon13  - I’m so honored.  That’s a very goodlooking horse.
@AllanJTaylor — Sorry, I’m way behind in my reading.

I'm sorry to report that the great Omaha magician and magic historian Walter B. Graham, (who rediscovered the lost mysteries of David P. Abbott), has died.  A close friend of mine for 40 years, he lived a joyful life through magic, even to his 90s.
The fab Kristin Chenoweth came to the @pennjillette and Teller show tonight.  I saw her in concert @SmithCenterLV last night and was awed by her voice, heart, and wit.

A dreadful shooting incident took place tonight in Vegas.  All of us with the P&amp;T show are healthy and unharmed.
@DanCollins4103 @pennjillette He's wonderful. Very devious.  And (if he hadn't already taken me aside and explained his method), he would have fooled me again!!

If you're in Vegas and there's a seat left for @MelBrooks tonight at the Wynn, go. A joyful man telling stories.  That's real theater.

@TravLane1105 @pennjillette - Good on ya.  Now the challenge will be to keep the routine filled with surprises.
@TravLane1105 @pennjillette - Electricity scares me.  I shy away from tricks with it.  In magic, all risks should be fake.
What a great picture. https://t.co/4lnlFSYpob
@Gabnetradio - Hello, my friend!
@afunnyjewishguy @pennjillette - Don't know the location yet, but if you look around, you'll see us.
@afunnyjewishguy @pennjillette - Always!  It's one of our favorite parts of doing the show.

@iraglass Did you get my DM?
Our good buddy @M_Carbonaro on  @TODAYshow show with some cute pets who served @pennjillette and me well in bygone times.
@charbrowmitch - An adventure.
@hogmanay79 @pennjillette - I'm thinking we should use that as ad copy: "Better than being stranded at the Grand Canyon Food Court!"
@queenrissa @pennjillette -- Nah, BS specialized in malarky that had an element of plausibility
@PamelaCash11 - and Harpo's a croquet maniac.  More reason to love 'em.
@iraglass @LasVegasMag @pennjillette - Thanks, Ira.  I'm a massive fan.
@EEFWW Thanks.  I downloaded it.
Arriving in Chicago (not Paris, as the picture might suggest) to cast for Aaron's and my 2018 production of MACBETH. So fair and foul... https://t.co/e7sjN3kJ1r
I love Harry Frankfurt's definition of bullshitting:  It isn't lying.  It's talking without caring whether what you say is true or false.
@Tellers_Alpaca - Yes, of course.
@MrAmericanMike - Of course.  Brilliantly poetic.
@XavierMortimer created a brilliant, original illusion.  And he's the only person on the planet with the chops to execute it.  Bravo! https://t.co/Mb0Vjwr4Fc
That's pretty amazing.  Thanks for posting it.  Great eye and great graphic character.   I love it being done on lined notebook paper, too. https://t.co/4RtM65R2lJ

@Sophia_Sorenson - Congrats, kiddo!
@EEFWW - You're most welcome.
@EEFWW - Did you thank me for the book, or just make jokes about its inadequacy?
@EEFWW - But that would be spelling it wrong in American, now wouldn't it?
Happy New Year!  Tonight we skip the show, avoid unruly crowds, watch movies (2002 NICHOLAS NICKLEBY) and laugh at home with good friends.
@AmandaHilden @WendyBirdOZ @bird2brain - You know my deadly addiction.
@baconboy628 Poe still slays me.
@mexime1t @pennjillette @rchlwll Ah, the best dressed audience members in the crowd that night.  Beyond dapper to glamorous.
@PittAtheist @pennjillette Honored to be compared to the Jets!
@krisnavymom Haha!  You did!
@WendyBirdOZ @pennjillette -- even a few hours late, it worked!  New stuff went smoothly and seems very promising indeed.
Tonight, supported by the relentless work our brilliant crew &amp; Johnny Thompson, @pennjillette and I put in 15 minutes of hard new material.

We are on a pre-holiday break between December 11 &amp; December 22nd. Our last show before will be this Saturday, and we'll resume Dec 23rd,
I bragged too soon.  No new material till after the holiday break.  We encountered a safety issue, which always supersedes our impatience.
@baconboy628 Hay?

@EEFWW @okgo - It's close kin to William Blake's poem which starts, "To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower."
@EEFWW -- Oops, I forgot.  Shakespeare wrote under patronage, too, didn't he.  So he was just pandering to his patrons.  Such crap he wrote.
@EEFWW - Hm.  Smoke and explosions, just like Méliès. Couldn't be anything uplifting in that. Ever notice any violent images in Shakespeare?
@EEFWW @okgo - If you don't approve of art created under patronage, you'll have to throw out Shakespeare, too.
@EEFWW -- I missed the "peddling." This looks to me like art on an uplifting theme, funded by a sponsor.  I find that admirable.
@EEFWW @okgo - And the Sistine Chapel is a commercial for Catholicism and the St. Matt Passion for Lutheranism.  Therefore bad art?
@okgo are to our media what Georges Méliès was to the cinema of the 1890s.  https://t.co/B76YRheHSX

@WendyBirdOZ Nice!  I want to see that!
@ShazamMagic If you bring a complex question to the post-show festivities, maybe hang back till I've greeted fans with simpler agendas.
@ShazamMagic - But if I suggest a question, it will be predictable, so I'm afraid that won't help.

@ChristoHypnose @pennjillette Danke schoen.
@KidAceMagic @vinnygrosso - A pleasure to hang with the both of you.

@VG98_ @pennjillette - Nope.  We focus on cards in a later release.
@JJBrent @pennjillette - Obvious to you now, but I was too close and too focused on the glasses to see it.
Saw @RealJerryLewis's sweet, wistful, gently funny new movie #maxrose.  Lewis's acting seems so effortless and his star quality shines out.
@tim_forte - Johnson as two-term governor of New Mexico has as much experience as Jefferson, Roosevelt, Reagan, W. Clinton, and GW Bush.
@SJActress - You could also model it off Virgil's "Ne credite equo, Teucri." (Don't trust the horse, Trojans!) &amp; say:  Ne arcana ostendite!
@SJActress - NE ARCANA (or OCCULTA) OSTENDAMUS (let us not show secrets) or NOLI ARCANA OSTENDERE! (do not show secrets!) would do it.
@tim_forte - Nope.  A candidate with fewer, and less significant, problems than Clinton or Trump.  Fit, sane, and honest, for starters.
@zajako @pennjillette - Y'all know we already have an app?  It's a wonderful trick I do for people all the time.  https://t.co/Y7ATd8mS7v

Tonight at @RioVegas the world premiere of two new bits in the @pennjillette and @MrTeller show:  Dracula and Circle Stop.

@CardSpencer That is the strangest place I've ever been in my life.  Nothing compares.  Utterly surreal.  And so cold...
@Jasonwalker95 @pennjillette - We'll be watching back.  It's the nature of theater.

I like when a movie draws you in deliberately, confidently, not desperately. #SullyMovie.  I don't like movies frantic for my attention.
It's just nice to see a movie without cartoon violence and cuts ever 1.5 seconds.   #SullyMovie. @tomhanks is always convincing and complex.
#SullyMovie is well written, produced, and acted. It's not a documentary, so naturally they've heightened the conflict. That's fine by me.

Was greeted by this happy balloon sculpture representing "Shadows" at the hotel at Utah Shakespeare Festival. Wow. https://t.co/V7fMg6wux0
Watched #TheManWhoKnewInfinity last night, thanks to @stephenfry.  A new angle on intuition &amp; talent.  Such acting! https://t.co/3VzOVR6oGG
I'd never seen this very fine interview before.  It's not new information, but very well put with great zest. https://t.co/GXqbHO4IFA
Whole bunch of nominations for "The Tempest" in Chicago, including Nate Dendy for Ariel, Johnny Thompson for magic: https://t.co/58H5jdcrj2
@jkyle2k19 - Many times.  I enjoy it.  Especially when they recite poems I made them memorize.
My good friend and Latinist Penny Cipolone (with her son) supporting a couple of unknown candidates. https://t.co/NQH0q2DcUW
Oh, that's wonderful. https://t.co/Tyx71r7Q2Z
@WendyBirdOZ @JKCorden @pennjillette @latelateshow -  It's CBS from the US.
@bobabrahams @pennjillette When Penn does that bit after the Water Tank in the live show, I dry off, put on new clothes, and go for a pee.
@sassyscoopics @MacKingShow -Go to @MacKingShow in Vegas.  You will be deliciously fooled.
@MyJolieH @JKCorden @latelateshow He's genteel to the highest degree but in performance, he hits you like a hurricane of comic joy.
@DagnyTaggart78 Merci!
@clintnovak Yes, with half an hour to spare!
@JKCorden -  Your  kindness + volcanic comic energy affects everybody.  When I praise your staff, they say, "It comes from the top down."
I love that picture.  At first I thought it was full of shotgun holes, then I realized it was the lobby lights. https://t.co/AtPRzMYVnn
I'm just pretending.  @JKCorden's tie is perfect at @latelateshow. What a joyful environment he creates on the set. https://t.co/ejCVVNFDZ3

Man, that's elegant.  Wow. https://t.co/Po0PFbVbyS
Penn asks Trump to say something more concrete than listing the problems and boasting he will solve them. https://t.co/4BvJtaPaBv
Very nice picture1  The "litter" on the floor is the markings the crew uses to place props properly. https://t.co/2zjfEu0TKi
@samwallace84 @AFANLV @pennjillette -- damn, saw this too late, but it's a fine idea.
@magicianofcomed @pennjillette Thanks.  I'm still very proud of that book.  We did much nobody'd ever done before in quite that way.
@WendyBirdOZ @SJActress It's a souvenir you don't have to pack in your luggage. It fades about the same moment others are mislaying theirs.
It's a gem.  So THAT"s how you did that restoration on "Fool Us." https://t.co/VKef6pEjgA
That @MWilsonNYT story reminds me of "The Monsters Have Come To Maple Street" from Twilight Zone.  It must make terrorists feel very smug.
Here's the website of @REHandCrafted, who made that beautiful custom card clip:  https://t.co/2OqiBtOl6O.  Amazing work.
Wow, great pic.  We are honored. https://t.co/qJPHCt4Uw8

@GlassesAndSass - I once sneaked in &amp; hung a piece of chewed salt water taffy in a minimalist art show. The vortex has to be a gag, too, no?

@Tessersnacks -- Yes, and I've been unable to locate that documentary (the basis for HITCHCOCK/TRUFFAUT). Where did you see/find it, please?
@karansinghmagic Just don't ask for my shoes next time.
Very nice bit of insane portraiture.  Bravo. https://t.co/hdCj7S07XZ
@shoutsatcows @Channel4 @pennjillette - I loved that show, too, but it's property of Channel 4 in Britain.  I have no control.
@corbin2point0 @pennjillette - We'd love to.  Book us.
@SelfPossessed @pennjillette - My calendar says the Rio.
A nice kids' magic lesson without words.  And a fine trick I did as a child.  The guy has kind of a scary stare. https://t.co/3LABt3fgVh

@musicman613 @pennjillette - What's that newspaper article.  Do you have a link on it?
@CammysMagic1 @pennjillette Our producers say:  Email to Fooluscasting@gmail.com.
@CammysMagic1 @pennjillette - Try for next season.  But you'll need more than a good double lift to fool us.
@DeeAnn3141592 - We always do that joke to keep the bit from being too sugary, and give that spectator our own giant cards and big hugs.

@gemmadodd @pennjillette - "Tonight Show" had to reschedule us.  So terribly sorry. We're on Tue. and Sat., if that helps at all.
The new @Jonesjazz album ROARIN' is now shipping.  It's a thing of wit and beauty.  https://t.co/rpVZIXsEHW or https://t.co/2pCuXJbaMN.
Woody, we are very grateful to you for "Love Ritual."  It's so much fun helping zillions of people find love. https://t.co/SYFI9VsIqU
@dudeitsjesse @pennjillette Generally, when they fool us, they do rush up to us afterwards, eager to explain how they did it.
So glad you're still enjoying it.  Joe would be pleased. https://t.co/xI1kvegskM
Penn, Ringo, Teller, and Joe Walsh at the Rio show tonight.  Peace. https://t.co/iFkMKro7V1

@CrisTurman I just use mine a lot and try not to slam them in doors.  What do you use yours for?
I'm at @SmithCenterLV seeing the new show IDAHO.  A feast of songs about sex with farm animals. https://t.co/EC4N13LEKD
@CrisTurman If you're just driving locally, yes.  I plug it in at night and it's got 236 miles of charge.  A full day of driving in Vegas.
Penn pointed out to me this very sweet article about THE TEMPEST in Vegas having an impact on the theater scene.  https://t.co/pRuftGUQGT
@cracksh0t This is my fave.  More an expose than a history.  https://t.co/vmgdMPTJyc.
@AustinLukeAdams @pennjillette -- Sorry!  We got a call from Jimmy Fallon asking us to fly to NY and be on his show that night. Back Wed.

Not only elegant, but flattering! https://t.co/qjqDVnoV0V
At the Canadian conference, I learned that people were using stacked decks as early as 1490.  Devious bastards could have fooled Columbus.
I spent the afternoon studying up on the history of magic sets for an article I'm writing.  The earliest one I've found: Germany, 1805.
Thursday and Friday I was in Toronto at @sharingwonder's "31 Faces North" a conference of pro magicians, honoring Johnny Thompson.
Very nicely done! https://t.co/DesFwdRpJC
Great story. We came so close to losing it all, save for a husband's thoughtfulness and a magician's determination. https://t.co/a2XISgkAOK
@despair - They're auditioning to be on "Doveshit!"
Tonight during my pre-show training session with the doves, the star dove shat on my shirt not once, but twice.  The tinsel, the glamor.
Johnny Thompson on the recent cascades of awards:  "I'm out of space.  If I hang one more thing on the wall, the house will fall down."

@eric_ralph  An excellent trick and a promising young feller.
@B_riet - Used to be but we sold out the edition.  Totally.  I don't even have spares for gifts for dear friends.
My favorite new CD release.  https://t.co/ji5pjP7MtY by @davidbg - It's so beautiful, it makes me smile and cry at the same time.
@catkthompson - It was my honor.
@Sophia_Sorenson - That's glorious.
@EEFWW - Is it some fantasy language?  I googled it and it translates "for the greater good," which it is not in Latin.
@Mike_Horney @jimmyfallon @GovGaryJohnson @pennjillette - Good idea.  Book it.
Just got home from 1st time in Venice.  A mysterious museum people actually live in.  EPCOY:  Experimental Prototype Community of Yesterday.
@LordPachelbel @pennjillette -- Send us a practical method and I'll make the dive.
@EEFWW @derek_del Sometimes rules are rules, you know?
@EEFWW @derek_del - I am not permitted to be part of the booking process.  Against the rules.
The magic tricks that @derek_del does in IN AND OF ITSELF are not the main thrust of the show, but they fooled the hell out of me.
I just saw @derek_del doing IN AND OF ITSELF.  https://t.co/kqIN9C0fJq It is daring, weird, touching, amazing, truthful, and inspiring..
"Mononymous".  Hm.  I guess it's better than "unimonikered."  But it's nice to be mentioned.   https://t.co/lM3yMYh9yG
@itsdavidmckay @RoyalMagicBrand - Easiest if you bring it to the show.
Solo fun in Vancouver:  Skytrain to @bluewatercafe.  Mei Ling served me great sushi, sablefish, and carrot soup.  Then I saw MONEY MONSTER.
@WendyBirdOZ - Grazie!
On the way to Vancouver I watched THE MAN FROM UNCLE on the plane. It's arch.  And arch is harder than the filmmakers thought it was.
Had a blast onstage at the Rio shooting additional video instructions for #FoolEveryoneMagic @RoyalMagicBrand. https://t.co/qxi1gZt3I7

Backstage with @HumanNatureLive before the show.  These lads sure can sing. https://t.co/BB06WRu2Or
Saw @HumanNatureLive last night.  Massive fun. They make fun of their old days as a boy band, then blow you away with superb musicianship.
We consulted for #BrosTakeBroadway  @mrsilverscott @mrdrewscott @realgilbert  https://t.co/u0F2ZtTujH.  Sometimes it's hard to be tactful.
I love it.  Google searches for Gary Johnson increased by 5000% after Cruz dropped out.
@pguyton -- Yes.  It seems straightforward:  Don't be a cynic.  Don't assume we'll get the lesser of two evils.  Vote for the good.
I support Gary Johnson.  When Cruz dropped out, the phone bank at the Johnson campaign went nuts.  We should vote FOR somebody, not against.
@WendyBirdOZ Wow.  I'm expecting the Four Horsemen to emerge from that!
@kellyhair Flatterer!
Wow.  To be mentioned in this gives me hot and cold running chills.  https://t.co/SnxqrHuwTb

There is a tiny drop of dove excrement on my shirt.  It's from practicing with the doves.  I'm doing the show in that shirt.  Who'll notice?
This is a wonderful, funny horror movie.  I just became a "fan," which means I gave them $3 to view the film.  https://t.co/XiMKJytCQk
@EEFWW I stand corrected; I believe Sanders is honest.  But he favors a larger role for government in our lives than I can support.
The answer to the election is very straightforward.  Vote for the one candidate who is actually honest.  https://t.co/KZsS5KbMMM
https://t.co/KUbVbHne3X  At 27:30, watch it land.  Just like in the cartoons.  You will gasp and cheer.
@thecoreymc - I'll show that to Phyllis.  I'm guessing she didn't embroider that.
"Your grandchildren are you reward for not killing your teenagers."  -- Phyllis Bond, makeup department, "Fool Us."
@chichibop I had the same dream.  Delightful conversation.  You're thinking of the five of diamonds.

@AKA_DERBY @pennjillette - To follow Houdini's lead, the first improvement would be to do the tomb escape, but leave the stone in place.

@EEFWW - Ars longa.  Vita brevis.
@pennjillette and I on yet another showbiz list:  https://t.co/pVkGeA64M7
@DeValsspeler - Yes, the biggest influx of new live show material for a long time.  Some of it is re-vamped from the Refrigerator Tour.
@DeValsspeler - Saw it recently?  Animal traps?  Snake?  Chipper?  Elephant? Domestication of Animals?  Fire for 2?  Barrel?
@DeValsspeler There are shows every night thru Wednesday.  Perhaps you can make it another night.
Unbelievably flattering and well done.  Thank you! https://t.co/kVXBLTwR73

Got dilated today at my ophthalmologist's office.  Everything has a halo. Doc stared into my eyes through a lens.  He says they're perfect.
May I add: @pennjillette and I have the greatest crew in the world.  They've been working their asses off to get all that new/old stuff in.
@pennjillette and I (and crew) are planning to put Chipper, Snake, Barrel and Fire For Two, nto the Rio show for a while.  Seen 'em?
@Dena_Marina @pennjillette You mean ELEPHANT.  I forgive you.  It's a smallish elephant.

Whenever ambulances goes by on the nearby highway, all the coyotes on my property howl and screech like tortured souls in hell.  I love it.
Our FOOL EVERYONE magic set debuts today at the Toy Fair in NY today.  We designed it with  @royalmagicbrand.  All our favorite kids tricks!
I like to pretend that all the people who are having sex today are doing it to celebrate my birthday.
Thanks for all the lovely birthday wishes.  I'm a very lucky guy.
A phantom envelope with pages from "The King in Yellow" and cryptic prose in nested envelopes appeared without postmarks in my mail. Hm....

An article about the end of Jubilee by @Mikeweatherford.  https://t.co/h2UHtvx9wf
Was taken to "Jubilee" on its last night by friends as a pre-birthday celebration.  Farewell, Titanic, Samson, and so many perfect breasts.
@pennjillette sent me this.  https://t.co/73Ytpqx8hH -- Really, who need magicians when we have @okgo?
@WendyBirdOZ @MakePennBad Flatterer!
@terryteachout @jessesheidlower @TheAtlantic -- oops, just sent this redundantly.  Problem with reading top to bottom on the list of tweets.
@terryteachout @jessesheidlower -  Right you are.  Have you ever read my little Soames piece?  https://t.co/GoaiyBziFW

@EEFWW - I don't think so.  He seems to have been trying something quite new.
My wonderful co-director on THE TEMPEST and MACBETH just did a great new MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM in DC:  https://t.co/96igHKIi5p

Shortly after 1:10, this rapper uses @pennjillette and me as his shorthand for magic.  https://t.co/5PE5joB3UZ  Very flattering!
@subblaw @AmherstCollege - They've invited me many times, but they never pick a day I have off from the show.
We hit stride with KING OF ANIMAL TRAPS tonight and it thrilled me from head to toe.

@davidwogan I'm wondering if it suits small screens better than big ones.
@ProfessorSnack To my mind, unexcelled in any Bond films.
@ProAudioLabs Thanks.  It's a big ball, though.
@ProAudioLabs Long sold out.  Copies in auctions and sometimes on the Internet.
And even if you hated it, you gotta admit that the "Jaws" gag was good, and the dialog about M and C was pretty slick.
I watched the much-maligned SPECTRE on TV at home. Sure, it's an exercise in genre.  But done with such glamor and charm.  I kinda loved it.
I meant "and I."   I'm so selfless...

I'll be on @TheTodayShow on behalf of @pennjillette &amp; me tomorrow (Thursday) at 10:22 a.m.  A couple of sweet items from my old street show.
I watched the film "Speed" again last night.  Amazing, solid, witty structure full of twists and surprises. Keanu and Sandra vs. Dennis.
Just saw "Lady in the Van," and liked it enormously.  What a labor of love and amazing adaptation.  https://t.co/d77A7x2Hxk
@EEFWW - Blackwood's story, "The Willows," is one of the most chilling ever. Other Blackwood stuff less so. He has a great name, doesn't he?
This has to be one of the creepiest trailers of all time, for @pennjillette's "Director's Cut."  I love it.   https://t.co/rlPGwcRzgK

@AmandaHilden @EEFWW - Ah, Pepper's Ghost lives on!
@EEFWW Nope.
@bluedino666 @MrTeller TARBELL COURSE IN MAGIC, any books about Germain, Al Baker, or by Jim Steinmeyer or Henry Hay.
@robDIOYY - I'm working my ass off, but there is SO much nuance to learn before it begins to get properly funny/amazing.
@kungfupower - I am unworthy of such an excellent teacher.  But I love it.
@SDezzles @pennjillette - The rising rope is the simple part.   What about the lad who vanishes at the top?  Not to mention dismemberment...
@bluedino666 - Assume your audience is smarter than you.  Do every show you get offered.  Read old magic books.  You'll know all the rest.
@PhegitPolice - They're called "scleral shells" and I tell the tale of how they were made in CRUEL TRICKS FOR DEAR FRIENDS.
@austinmatthew -  Nope, onstage at the Rio in Vegas.  My evil twin...
Personally instructed by Johnny Thompson, this afternoon I transformed a white dove into a white silk hanky in mid-air. I'm a bit giddy.
@johnnykats @pennjillette @RioVegas - Good to see you, maestro.
@SDezzles @pennjillette The Indian Rope trick wasn't really ever done.  It's an amalgam of legend and misremembering.  Cool pic, though.
@SamTektzby - ....
@PplsAtheist @pennjillette - No worries.  We'll be here for you next time.
Thanks! https://t.co/SojAyon7Qd
@chicagoshakes - and thanks, CST, for the most amazing support imaginable on this show.
@ElizabethAWhite @fyrebear @pennjillette Just a rough night with the Red Ball trick.
@apanzerj Any more of these rarities in your collection, Adam?
@EEFWW - The artist is https://t.co/NgZiIiE1eN. Ariel is shown not as the speaker but as a symbol of magic (Prospero works via spirits.)

@ErdnaseinTO @pennjillette @pennjillette How did you get hold of the designs for our new suits?  That was all confidential...
@hunter_lite -- We based one of the stunts in HOW TO PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD (fancy-schmancy restaurant trick) on that practice.
@JeckelJake @pennjillette - She looks formidable indeed.  My favorite childhood Christmas present was my Mysto Magic set.  Good luck!
@PeterCawdron @EEFWW - No, no, you're doing it fine.  I'll fly down and play you a few rounds.  Maybe a friendly wager....?
@EEFWW @fritztheyodeler @RioVegas @pennjillette - who knows, maybe next year.
@fritztheyodeler @RioVegas @pennjillette - Yup.  But you should get online and buy them soon.  These holiday shows will sell out.
@NBCLeeAnn @pennjillette @eatateds - We left our prints in the cement, but I do not recall burying anything (other than that nasty plumber).
@fritztheyodeler @RioVegas @pennjillette - 9 p.m. every night between tonight and December 30th, then back on the usual schedule.
Saw "A Christmas Carol" at Nevada Conservatory Theatre this afternoon. Very solid, polished and affecting work. Nice fresh take on Scrooge.

Oh, there was a followup note describing the armor:  "It's about at the level of ash can lids."  Ash cans, in the stone age?  Dream logic!
On the way to Hollywood for the big Christmas parade today.  Please wave back.
"Nothing could surpass the lameness of the efforts of the stone-age armorers."  Words from a dream I had last night, recorded bedside.

@themagikbeans   That's a threat I can't ignore.
@sassyscoopics @KostyaMagician @pennjillette @HardRockOrlando - I have never liked the notion of opening acts. Seems like bait and switch.
The Albuquerque audience was very warm and kind.  I'd come back soon.
We are headed away from the Route 66 Casino show.  I put on the Nelson Riddle theme from the old Route 66 TV show. It's a great tune.

@Tellers_Alpaca @pennjillette Last I heard, possibly 2016.
@EEFWW @PeterCawdron - No current plans for New Zealand or Australia.  The distance, cost, and time of the travel are big challenges.
@Tellers_Alpaca, I'm told there are plans for 2016.
THE TEMPEST @chicagoshakes is so thrilling and funny, now that the cast has had a chance to work on it without those meddling directors.
I'm on a plane to @chicagoshakes to see THE TEMPEST tomorrow night, just for the hell of it.  I left my director's notebook at home.

Tomorrow at 8 a.m. @CBSThisMorning we're being interviewed by really nice and bright hosts.  They seemed pleased to be fooled.
I so love being fooled.  Thinking my hardest and still being mystified.  Failure as success. https://t.co/fRaDi1Q0Ky

Saw two shows and walked miles. https://t.co/zgBxIaWvuk
@EEFWW Absolutely.  It gave me a very clear view of another approach.  It's more traditional but much of it was surprisingly successful.

If I go out in Vegas, it's usually to:  Table 34, Strip View Cafe, Hash House, or Bachi Burger.
@tinytims - When I'm not working I steer clear of the Strip. At @RioVegas I like Buzio's and the All American Bar &amp; Grill. KJ Dim Sum, too.
I eat at lots of expensive restaurants. They drive me nuts. Evie's is inexpensive, has spectacular food, and happy, unpretentious service.
Evie's (now run by Evie's daughter, Diana) is my favorite Mexican food anywhere.  I had Carnitas (roast pork) and left with a rage to live.
I can't come to this part of the world without picking up 3 dozen tamales at Evie's in Detroit. http://t.co/e2twLMyVzV

@deadlypizza @YouTube @Jarek120- I did do silent street magic but wasn't a lot like that nice wholesome fellow. Though I can do a cartwheel.
@JenaCampo - Still working on it.  But it developed at the beginning over the course of a year or two.  I started easy - with razor blades

@EEFWW Yes.  I wore it yesterday and got good laughs.
@EEFWW - We grant wishes as often as Jehovah does.
@EEFWW Votive candles.
@richiej1985 @pennjillette - Not this year, but doubtless soon.
@EEFWW - I've read it.  The spy stuff is pretty speculative, but entertaining.
@ksteiner325 - You know, I've never seen a production done that way, and I'm mighty interested.  I hear it's highly effective.
@SammonSez I should check the archives.  I wonder if it's just vanished.

@craig_schaefer - Oh, yeah!  "Artisanal" is one of those bloated and simpering menu terms.
@nitroatomicus - Oh, good point on "foodie."  What a lame term.  I'm striking it from my vocabulary.  Thank you.
@oldyoungsoul1 The pleasure is mine.
I"m ready for the foodie term "indulgence" to fall out of fashion, as "decadent" did a decade or so ago.

@RascalPittman @pennjillette Can you palm a card?
@pabosher @chicagoshakes - Doubtless.
@modernminn @chicagoshakes - Have patience.
@chicagoshakes will be using Chicago actors.  I miss my old cast from Vegas/ART/SouthCoast, but the new cast is exciting, too.
@chicgoshakes also treats their guest artists like royalty.
The artistic, technical, and administrative folks at @chicagoshakes are SO ballsy and daring. if you have a cool idea, they just say "Yes!"
@chicagoshakes is beyond world class.  Perfect sight lines.  Flawless acoustics.  Even the marquee of is gorgeous. http://t.co/Qg9BOtougL

@zorabike @pennjillette -- It worked!!!
@kylamoffatt -- It's TJ!
Well, hot damn!  Rabbit from the Hat worked better than a charm.  Our furry friend appeared on cue and the audience, aptly, adored her.
Tonight on our stage, @pennjillette and I premiere the Rabbit From the Hat.
@NarsGlinley @pennjillette - Oh, that must be when we're shooting the next season of "Fool Us!"
@AutumnInBuffalo @ActuallyNPH - @pennjillette suggested that if Bullshit had won an Emmy, they'd have to say, "And the winner is Bullshit!"
@FabKiwi06 @pennjillette - Hey, give the man a break.  He did a much better "Hedwig" than I could have done.
@DavidWildsmith @pennjillette -Heck, we've been in the Jumble cartoons twice.  My father loved those, so it makes me very proud.
@NarsGlinley @pennjillette - Or you were trying for a Thursday or Friday night, when we are off.
@AndrewSViers @pennjillette - That gives you a 1 in 1000 chance.
@AndrewSViers @pennjillette -  Good luck!  I'm avoiding studying your photo so that you remain a stranger.  We never use people we know.
I love that Prof. Robert Greenberg, who does the Bach lectures I'm listening to, calls Bach's Leipzig collegium musician his "bar gig."

@magicdomico @pennjillette - You're right.  Some of the finest magicians delight, but don't fool us. That's a major point of the show.
@EEFWW @pennjillette - No, Eleanor.  Penn always does this on Ash Wednesday.
I'm afraid I didn't care for it.  I felt the journalist was amusingly skimming a topic whose actual depth eluded him.
Old "Piss and Vinegar" Bach took a couple months off to walk 400+ kilometers to hear Buxtehude play.  Bach's employers were a bit nettled.
I would not have argued over a parking space with Bach.  He'd have kicked my ass down the cobblestones.

@anthonyqkiernan - Working on it.
@bvisconti - If enough folks watch this time round, there will be new episodes.  We love doing this show.  Help us along, please.
Thank you all for watching FOOL US!  We had 1.76 million viewers and were the CW’s second most watched summer series premiere ever.
@JenaCampo @pennjillette - We call it the Forty Year trick, because literally uses skills we’ve been working on for 40 years.
@samrussellnz @RioVegas @pennjillette @CW_network - If folks like you watch regularly, a new season will follow pronto.
@ricjoh - Teller.  Think of it as you would Beyoncé or Prince.
@NoahLevine @tannensmagic - Thanks, but am waiting for my plane at Newark Airport.
@tongodeon @pennjillette - We ran into him once at Hollywood Magic.  I liked him.
@MagicNews_lol - Yup.  Next time I will send the tablecloth to those in need — in coach.
@adesmar123 - I really should learn to snatch the tablecloth out rapidly without disturbing the tray.
Great fun for @pennjillette and me to do our new card trick for @alroker and his TODAY show pals.  Known him forever. http://t.co/PDCi7Ww7K8
On a plane, whenever they put a tablecloth on your tray table, then put a tray on top of it, I feel they've lost their sense of purpose.
@AngieAndera — I did.  The story about it in one of our books is called “Magic for Mike Red Dog.”
@davidteasdaleme @pennjillette - Those marionettes look pretty beautiful and gigantic.
@exquisitejade - It’s a trick.
@FavoriteBooks27 FAR OFF THINGS and THINGS NEAR AND FAR by Arthur Machen.
@TJCMagic - The ball thanks you.  He is working hard on his acting.
@DonPinsent @ebongo91 @pennjillette - …if tiny is 5’9” and 180 pounds.
@BlakeReagan2 - Thanks so much!
@Nuvious @pennjillette - Use a first surface mirror (silvering on front, not behind ⅛” of glass.
@Ezekiel_Rage @pennjillette - Sometimes we share sources.  I often retweet Penn.

@DonPinsent @pennjillette - That’s superb, Don.  Conjoined twins who share virtually no characteristics -  pretty damn good description.
@evie_gallagher - We were editing while shooting, but the major part of the editing happened during the last of the five years it took.
@Dantheman2080 - I believe some of the un-aired ones are in there.

@EEFWW @ChrisRandall702 - Nope.  We may have shot TV there some time, but not real street performing.
@Boursin — I hear the CW is considering new episodes if this round does well for them.  I sure hope so.  I love doing that show.

@MyHandmade101 - It’s coming back from the UK with the show stuff on a boat.
@ChrisRandall702 - We never did street performing in NY.  Philadelphia (Newmarket) and a zillion Renaissance festivals.
@MagicScribe - Never be timid.  If I’m too pressed for time, I’ll always say so.
Laura in the P&amp;T office is a travel genius. Plane to LA was running too late.  1 phone call to Laura and I was on a new flight 2 gates away.
@EEFWW @Tessersnacks - a bronze bear dominates the courtyard and the house is full of skulls.  It's also utilitarian and shy on frou-frou.

@sackofcatfood - Active, vigorous verbs.  Concrete nouns.  Really, that’s all I ask.
@KnightLifePics @pennjillette - Alas, you’re dreaming.
@theneilkelso - I’m not good at reviewing rules for reviewers.
@MyJolieH - An academic sent me a summary of something I had said, but had translated it into that kind of prose.  It creeped me out.
Watched TALES OF HOFFMANN, the Powell/Pressburger opera film that inspired young George Romero’s romance with cinema.  Rampant ingenuity.
I loathe academic prose:  ugly piles of abstractions cobbled into wobbling overlong sentences.

@JenaCampo - My favorite is always the newest one, because it’s still the hardest.  So, currently:  “The Atheist Deck of Cards.”
@WelshMagician - email to autographrequests@penn-teller.com.  I’ve alerted them you’ll be writing.

@MyJolieH - Yes, there are.
@GlennPortman - It’s there.  I saw it there today.  Download and blu-ray.
@mries27 @pennjillette - I don’t have any info about that.  I’m guessing yes, once they stop rerunning episodes.
@Jenjolrai - I'm betting it will show up when all the props get back to Vegas.

@JenaCampo - The answer:  5 years.
@dpa0312 - I declined to allow them to use it because I didn’t want the full routine on TV.
@Jenjolrai @pennjillette - I saw only two letters while I was in the UK, one from a longtime fan we know and one from a pair of brothers.
@AmberHorne1 - I love a nice Earl Grey, but find that for my health I need to stay away from caffeine.  So my default is fresh mint.

@benyeo85 - that’s the P&amp;T theme song, music by Gary Stockdale, lyrics by me, that we wrote for the barehanded blood production routine.
@Sinclair1182 @India_Crone @pennjillette I wonder if that’s the show we did the “hyrdrostatic glass of blood” on…

@EEFWW, I recommend THE ADVENTURE OF ENGLISH by Melvyn Bragg.  Really entertaining history of the language.
http://t.co/gqNg8xst1m
@JenaCampo - Yes.
Great thanks to our friend Nick Einhorn, FOOL US winner, who hooked us up to the Windsor gig.  He was wowing the cocktailers with closeup.
@tommyelektrik @pennjillette - Actually the gravy was very tasty.  I wonder if Wellington ever dined there on his own beef.
I would not want to live in a castle.  The only air conditioning is opening the window.
We dined in the Waterloo Chamber, which is not to be confused with Water Closet.  It’s full of portraits of the Brits who beat Napoleon.
Royal dinner food:  Goat cheese, asparagus, artichokes; Beef Wellington, taters and veg; but no dessert for us; we had to go prep the show.
@etiennepradier, whom we met on Fool Us, co-billed with us on the Prince’s show.  Velvety, suave, French, and adored by the upper crust.
@The_MMfA_Cat @pennjillette @EricIdle He was there, so were they all.  Watched Cleese do a pants drop three times.  Joy!

@AdamSydneyBloom - On those rare occsions when we have an obstreporous patron, the security staff ushers her/him out.
@DarkRomeo88 - Howard Hawks said it was good to hurt somebody in the first few minutes of a movie, so the audience would take you seriously.

Oops, I mean Greeley.
The theater in Greely is outstanding.  Quite beautiful, intelligently  designed, and (most important to me) sold out.
Greely seems like a very nice place.  Clean and when I stepped out of the way of two skateboarders, one called out, “Thank you, sir.”
@Muggstar - Sorry to hear about that.  He was a gloriously funny and good person.
@DisneyKnitter @pennjillette - Hey, thanks.  Right back at you.
