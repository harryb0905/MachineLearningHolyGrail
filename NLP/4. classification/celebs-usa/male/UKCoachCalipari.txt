A belated happy birthday to a special man and a special friend, Phil Knight. The impact he’s had on not only his field but on people is immeasurable. He’s a good man. He’s a competitor, but he has a great heart and will continue to have an impact on people like me. Happy bday!
Proud of @TerrenceJones1! Refused to give up on his dream and grinded his way back. https://t.co/SC1pTqi1gt
It’s @USAmbCanada’s birthday today. She’s been nominated to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. What an honor on her special day. I’m happy for you, my friend!!!
Two boys relaxing at the office! https://t.co/Usk5jFBIMv
We honored UK nursing student Brandon King before the game today as an Everyday Hero.   Brandon saved the life of one of our campus police officers! https://t.co/GiFaEzCVhV
Great team win today and I was so happy to see my friends Lori, Lulu and Patrick Harrington after the game! https://t.co/olRsPFg40g
Happy birthday @BeMore27! So proud of all that you’ve accomplished on the floor and the man you are off of it!! https://t.co/0enMFsmYZZ
What a special moment for our team today to meet the 1958 national champions. So proud of our athletic department for bringing folks back home. #LaFamilia https://t.co/ecZN8k3lRS
Today is my baby sister's birthday. She's a great daughter, sister, mother and wife. Happy birthday, Lea! Proud of you!
The first time Brandon ever gave CPR, it was to save the life of one of our campus police officers. He’s another example of the special people we have on our campus and I am looking forward to having him join us at Rupp on Saturday! https://t.co/63OHweNtc7
We hope Reid will be ready for around the conference tournament or maybe even a little bit before, but I’m happy for him that we’re going to get him back.
I just feel so good that it was more of a sprain than anything else because you just get worried about that stuff when you see someone go down. We are going to be very conservative with this so he may be out a couple weeks. https://t.co/II2eeNHwNI
#BBN, you're going to want to watch this. Don't know if you'll be able to sleep after watching it though. LOL! https://t.co/JDFtPpFvMH
This one with Erin was when I was hired at UMass. https://t.co/cQEPX6loh2
Erin always had to be first ... just like her mom! LOL!  Love you, Erin. Hope you have a great birthday. https://t.co/g0xaA1svFz
It’s @TheErinCalipari’s birthday! She has grown into a very talented, driven young woman who I’m so proud of. I can still remember her climbing the drawers in the kitchen, running and talking all day, then putting herself to bed. She would be sleeping in two minutes!!! https://t.co/RqyxzICnMd
Had to go see my high school teammate Tommy Hill, who is fighting ALS. A kind soul and a great person who was my protector!! Praying for you daily, my brother. https://t.co/HuOkyf5LL1
Moon High school teammates Paul Ellington, Jim Gracey and Mark Miller in town! https://t.co/30bybRFJRH
Not romantic? How bout the rose?  Spoiling the princess!! https://t.co/Ot8VT7i97c
I’m proud of my wife and how she is stepping outside her comfort zone.   She is a great mother, wife and roommate!   Happy Valentine’s Day, Smellen. (My secret nickname)  Who’s funny now??
I know I’m not romantic and truly do nothing in my home, but I did take my wife to a Valentine’s dinner. She also got a very, very thoughtful card with chocolates.  The dog got ahold of the card though so it’s very nice, but beat up.
Let's do it again, #BBN! I hear @CollegeGameDay has some special things planned. Our team is looking forward to being a part of it. https://t.co/0zPGqiayq1
I always tell our players that our legacies should be about more than just basketball and I love seeing young people who serve those in need.  I’m so proud of Jessica for her servant leadership and I’m looking forward to having her as a guest at our game on Saturday! https://t.co/CWBEDDzzzr
https://t.co/jquwfzHMiQ
The players surprised me tonight at dinnner and they all wore shirts with my face on it. They think they’re funny!  I’ve heard from so many friends and former players today and I really appreciate it, but what’s all this 60 stuff?? I don’t know what anyone’s talking about! https://t.co/ib94LD8OdZ
Getting better but we’ve got a tough stretch ahead.  https://t.co/PiUP1E0ECC
Ellen and I are proud of @TheErinCalipari. She’s trying to bring light to a serious problem in our country. She’s on a great path to having an impact to improve lives. I’M JEALOUS!! https://t.co/kKZOPdGPzl
Today is the day! Tune in to @BravoTopChef at 8pm to see the power of #BBN on full display. They’ve done a great job all season showcasing what makes our state great and tonight we celebrate UK basketball.   And I learned there’s more to food than just eating it!! https://t.co/sK9clTpZQ6
Wow!!! #BBN is going to have fun next weekend, I know that. Glad to see @KevKnox get added to the Rising Stars Game and to see three more guys in the skills portion. Congrats to all of our guys. https://t.co/o17yAXZZxw
Really sad day. Phil Martelli’s father and Win Rainey passed away this morning. Phil’s father was a loyal soldier to his son and family. Win was an unbelievable husband to Johnanna and was the president of the Rebounders Club. Praying for both their families. https://t.co/RPvECIcPMk
I know I'm asking for a lot of prayers lately but this one we really need your help with, #BBN. @AlexTheGreat22's sister is giving one of her kidneys to her mother today. The ultimate sacrifice! Thinking about Alex and his family today.
I’m sick. Just heard about @JohnWall’s Achilles injury. Haven’t talked to him yet but I heard it was a freak accident at his house. I’m with you, John. You will get through this. #BBN, let’s lift him up.
Want to wish @PJWashington’s dad well as he has knee replacement surgery today. #BBN, keep him in your thoughts today.
GK is one of Memphis’ finest. He has been an unbelievable ambassador for the city, for Graceland, for Elvis Presley and his family. He is a special guy. I had communion for him this morning and lit a candle for him. Praying for you, buddy.
Before every game when I was at Memphis, GK would come in and sit down with me before the game and then he would come in after the game and we’d talk. He was one of the biggest supporters I had in the city. He absolutely loved the run we went on.
I’ve been back to see GK a couple different times recently. He was a well-known DJ and also a part of SiriusXM Radio. The stories he has of Elvis are amazing, and not just about concerts but about how he was to people he cared about.
George Klein, my loyal friend from Memphis who was a part of the Memphis Mafia, Elvis Presley’s crew, is having a tough time and could use our prayers.
Really proud of the way our guys responded in the second half Saturday.  https://t.co/svNAZah37v
.@raf_tyler made 95 3-pointers in the five-minute shooting drill today!!!!  Crazy. By the way, @bradcalipari made 50 in a row. Chip off the old block!!   LOL!
Happy birthday to Dajuan Wagner!!! To this day no player in college has ever scored more for me in a single season. Jim McCoy scored a bunch in my first years at UMass and @BeMore27, @AhmadMonk and @Goodknight11 all made a run at him but he’s still No. 1. Happy birthday! https://t.co/N9BxV1xXnJ
Happy birthday to @AhmadMonk, who is playing really well. Double figures in four straight games! Keep it up, Malik! https://t.co/K5OWtOX1tK
That’s what 86 candles look like! Dad loving his day yesterday! https://t.co/ULe9nkPfzz
Had some special people in practice yesterday: Neil Chatterjee and @Dodgers pitcher @buehlersdayoff! https://t.co/TaQsFWjjQf
Congrats to @UKDeWaynePeevy who’s been w/me since the day I got to UK. He still doesn’t know anything about bball but he’s become an unbelievable friend &amp; part of the foundation of this program. And only kidding about the bball thing. You’ve picked up a thing or two from me. LOL! https://t.co/Scn0ehCbPF
When my mom got sick and he had to take care of her 24 hours a day the last six months of her life, he did it with no complaints. He told me, “I would have gladly done 10 more years”. That was his finest hour. Thanks, Dad. I love you.
He was a gatherer who would make friends with all plus would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it more than him. He was also my sixth grade basketball coach and let me shoot all the balls! @bradcalipari would be jealous!!
My dad’s birthday is today. His impact on me is immeasurable. The ultimate grinder who would work double shifts and come home and cut the grass. Work never scared him. I think he loved it! https://t.co/bURse7SCOP
Sooo happy for both @KarlTowns and @AntDavis23 for making the All-Star team. Both well deserved!  And can’t wait to watch @shaiglalex and @swipathefox in the Rising Stars game!
If someone in your community is putting others first, showing compassion to people in need or doing anything to make a difference in the lives of others, we want to congratulate and THANK them.  Send your nominations to coach@coachcal.com.
Servant leadership is at the core of what we teach and I am constantly inspired by stories of fans who are touching lives in their own communities. And I want to celebrate them.  I’m happy to announce the launch of “John Calipari’s Everyday Heroes”, with the support of @Jockey.
One of the best TEAMMATES to play any sport! Was hard on himself but never his team. Would take a back seat to let someone shine but would always put himself on the line to win!!  Love you, @drose! https://t.co/hOCH9OzJq8
It’s @joejoepalumbo’s birthday today. Have a great day, my friend!!! https://t.co/AWhLX5M6jc
My college teammate Jeff Szumigale has our guys out to dinner tonight. Wish I could have been two places at once! https://t.co/frtpuOX09H
I was in Nashville at the @dunkindonuts and the line was long, so I tried to order coffee on the app.   Obviously, I don’t know what I’m doing because there’s a coffee with one cream and one Splenda at the Dunkin Donuts on Main Street in Philly waiting to be picked up.
Our guys are building their own confidence. https://t.co/xlY3mnCceR
Two special people from my Western Pennsylvania days were in town for the Kansas game, Bob Maher and his daughter Mary Lynn! https://t.co/wAEHCGU6eB

#BBN, we need you at your best tomorrow. Let's pull our guys through this one. https://t.co/fQhgyRmBsL
#BBN, we need you for this game, starting with @espn @CollegeGameDay tomorrow morning! Let’s show the nation why nobody does it better than we do. I’ll be down after our shootaround to check out the show. And I hear there’s going to be free ice cream    ➡️ https://t.co/5OQBeTc6Yd https://t.co/UwTIaUXrYO
Happy for you, @TyreseMaxey. Can’t wait to coach you! https://t.co/QiZzWrk1dO
The Lexington ATF is struggling during this time yet found time to do this for us. How kind is that!!! https://t.co/2kfluICg5w
Everything we’ve done through grants is not being asked to be paid back when this is over. We are asking them to pay it forward. We are hoping this shutdown ends soon but we are prepared to help if we need to.
Met w/the last group of federal workers today, which means we’ve connected w/nearly 500 families who aren’t being paid through this shutdown period. Ellen &amp; I have taken great joy w/the opportunity to help others. It’s maybe meant more to us than even the people we are serving.
Gretchen Morrow, a good woman who helped raise me, passed away last night. Her children Brenda, Jimmy, John and Mary were neighbors and our friends. Please include them in your prayers.
These are tremendous. Hope the #BBN joins these behind-the-scenes looks. https://t.co/SExM5uNwB3
Come on, #BBN. Still plenty of time left tonight to get those votes in. We've got so many guys playing well right now. https://t.co/QmtVHmIEpT
Glad my good friends Steve and Kevin Trager could stop by today. https://t.co/QajqPv7D3A
The funds will go to the 2019 Emergency Shutdown Government Relief program administered by REACH Inc., a Lexington nonprofit organization.  The program assists federal government employees who work in the Lexington area and meet eligibility guidelines established by REACH.
#BBN, many of our friends and neighbors are hurting right now because of this government shutdown. I'm asking you to please consider helping federal workers in our community.  You can text "GIVE" to 859-955-8173 or visit https://t.co/xPlwgFcV9i https://t.co/7R2hOCGE9H

Spent some time this morning thinking about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. He passed away at the age of only 39. Think about all the lives he touched in such a short amount of time.   Wanted to share some of my favorite quotes of his on #MartinLutherKingJrDay ...
My friend John Chaney turned 87 today. I know everyone still remembers when I tried to choke him — or wait, did he try to choke me? I can’t remember. LOL. A true Hall of Fame basketball coach but even better at developing young men. I miss our battles. Happy birthday, Coach!
Happy belated birthday to @JenNimePalumbo!. How did I forget??

All of you fantasy campers should be jealous! We had Ken and Benji Brakebill at the game tonight. Great getting a win with our Fantasy Camp family in Rupp Arena! https://t.co/hGOuHshMQh
My focus is continuing to “build” this team and program and @Bullard1898 is showing their support by providing hard hats to fans at Rupp tomorrow.  During halftime, @GWR will be on hand to see if BBN can set a world record! https://t.co/m88cNBR1WN
Had a great dinner at Dudley’s last night with Coach Xu and Coach Li. It’s been a pleasure having them with us this week! https://t.co/SbXhRxdYep

I want to wish my man @TerrenceJones1 a happy birthday!! So proud of you and all that you have accomplished!! https://t.co/x39Ed9dNvS

You know I like to mourn for at least 24 hours after a loss so I didn't get a chance to wish @tulis3 and @IsaacHumphries7 a happy birthday yesterday. Hope you guys had a great day yesterday!
.@KevKnox!!! He was built for this!!! https://t.co/HjsRKvVRZ2
They could have easily sat out the game but they chose not to. What’s great is each player’s stock rose by playing and performing. I’m not saying that’s the right thing in every case, but it did show why this team won. They were truly about each other this entire season.
For @benny_snell, @JoshAllen41_, @M__Edwards7, @cjconrad1 and others – all of who are going to get drafted – deciding to play for their TEAM, their coaches, their university, their state and most importantly for each other tells me the tale of why this football team won.
If you know me, you know I follow all of the sports here pretty closely. I’ve got great relationships with all the coaches, but I have to single out some individual players on our @UKFootball team and what they did in Tuesday’s bowl game …
I look forward to having him on our campus a lot more now!
I just talked to @dontaieallen11. He is gonna have surgery on his knee. Feel bad because he was having a monster year but like I told him, there are always bumps in the road. Adversity is a part of sport, especially basketball. You come out stronger by dealing with it head on!!!!
GREAT ending to a historic season for @UKFootball. Come-from-behind wins. Unbelievable defensive play making. Opportune offensive plays. Great coaching. And the best fan base in the country that deserved this. What a finish to the season! Congrats to @UKCoachStoops and his team!
Player-driven practices are enjoyable for players and coaches. Stay in the moment! Conquer yourself each day and watch what happens. #HappyNewYear!!! 🎊
Just left the guys. Three sessions today. Man, they are dialed in. My job is to make them uncomfortable. Their job is to be comfortable when it is uncomfortable!
Wow!!! #BBN, you will enjoy this.  https://t.co/2q9kfWx0zR
Louie Dampier stopped by to watch practice today. One of the best shooters to ever play the game! Coach Hall came by practice as well!!! https://t.co/wNkYN7SBlo
I tell our players to try to touch the lives of others and I hope the spirit of this holiday season will inspire you to do the same. There are a lot of people hurting, people who feel they have no hope. Let’s challenge ourselves to be the light in their lives.  Buon Natale, #BBN!
Merry Christmas, BBN! This is a special time of the year and I hope that you all are able to spend it with your loved ones. Do not take those moments for granted!!
#BBN, an early Christmas present.    https://t.co/9HTdVivDbZ
It’s how do I help these guys get better and what is the best way for us to play. What roles do I have to put these guys in to make us the best team? We are still trying to figure this out but we are getting closer, as you can see.   Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, #BBN.
This is a process and has always been. Every year it’s been that way. My focus today is no different than it was two weeks ago.
But it’s hard to be a player-driven team. They have to hold each other accountable. They have to practice the way they want to play, and it can’t be because a coach is riding you.
I usually don’t do this, but I’m going to share the text I sent the players a little bit ago. If one or two guys play lackadaisical, this team cannot win. This is a team that’s going to have to fight every possession for 40 minutes. If we do that, we’re going to have a fun year. https://t.co/OKjen16Fur
Yesterday we played harder than we’ve played all year and we played unselfish. We had a lot of guys play well. That’s why we won.
#BBN, I’ve got to tell you now after yesterday’s game: Don’t go crazy! Don’t lose your mind over one game. As I’ve said all along, it’s a process. We win or we learn. Nothing has changed no matter the results (although I should mention that Seton Hall won at Maryland yesterday!).
Happy birthday, @HarrisRob3! https://t.co/VSKVAWZars
Happy birthday to @swipathefox! What a season he’s having. One of the brightest young stars in the game! https://t.co/SVeaWUPWfS

Every year, we engage with our community during the holidays to try to brighten people’s spirits and @kentuckybranded always partners with us to provide clothes. We appreciate their generosity and I hope #BBN will shop there for everyone on their list!!

Thank you to Johnny Moran, Kyle Burns, Taylor Berryman, Alford Harris, Robert Vent, Randy Gregory, Michael Boorman, Kevin Gallagher and Vince Manna. Barrett Bouska and Sam Whitaker couldn’t make it because of finals but they’re a part of the team!
Managers appreciation Christmas dinner at Lexington Country Club. Great people who make a difference!Success is in their future. Thanks for all you do for the players, staff and the program!!! https://t.co/XpSZK1RAfe
Quade has my full support with this decision. We haven’t had many kids leave, but when we do, we always support them and, in just about every case, stay in touch with each other. I hope that will be the case with Quade.
I met with @Q_Green1 yesterday and we talked through a lot of different things. The thing that struck me most is what a great kid Quade is. He felt like he was in a position that he couldn’t overcome and he had the maturity to come in and sit down and talk through it with me. https://t.co/MlvqBpzPMe
Happy birthday to @EBled2! Hope you’ve had a great day! https://t.co/cGkOs8OAQc
I grieve for 24 hours after a loss so I have a few more hours to go but I went to mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral this morning and lit a row of candles for the #BBN around the world.

It's also Joe B. Hall's 90th birthday today! I can't think of a better man, friend and mentor than Coach Hall, who has been unbelievable to me during my time here. Love looking over at practice and seeing him in the gym. We'll get that 1-3-1 zone in there one day, Coach! https://t.co/asTpL5nGwN
It’s Ellen’s birthday today! Even after 32 years of marriage you’ve never changed from the sweet and caring, loving mother and wife you are. I love you and I hope you have a great day. https://t.co/8Hay7OcJao
Big day today. Happy birthday, guys! But only current players get birthday brownies so @iamnickrichards wins out today. Unless of course @UKCoachJustus sneaks a few away for himself. https://t.co/k5WnuGomW0
He coached his son and prepared many for successful lives. Man am I gonna miss him. Please include him in your prayers.
Joe Bayno passed away this morning. His son Bill was on our UMass staff in the 90s. He was a great father and friend to our entire staff.  He was a loving person. Joe was a terrific high school basketball coach and teacher in Goshen.

I’m gonna spend two days out on the road recruiting but before I left we had individual work and a film session. I’m encouraged. These kids understand what’s between us and doing something special. Today they really brought it. I like my team. I really like my team.

I will say she was MUCH sweeter at school than she was at home, but living with @TheErinCalipari will do that to you!!  Love you, Meg!  Dad
Today is @MeganteCalipari’s 29th birthday.  She was born on Thanksgiving in Massachusetts during a crazy snow storm and we were pulled over by the police on the way to hospital!  I am so proud of the woman she has become. She juggles many responsibilities, yet stays who she is. https://t.co/FxiS2DEgai
We have so much to be thankful for, and this is always one of my favorite days of the year when our players can make an impact and serve at the @salvationarmyuk. #HappyThanksgiving, #BBN! https://t.co/CyEtImfXjR
Only by the grace of God are we — my family and my team — in the position we are in. What do you with it? How do you serve others? If our players learn nothing else when they leave here, I hope it’s how to be a good steward and serve others. https://t.co/eV4BcI2VFV
Anthony Davis just scored his 10,000th career point in the NBA.  My brain: Don’t say it  Don’t say it  Don’t say it  Don’t say it  Don’t say it  Don’t say it  Don’t say it  Me:  “He took the fourth-most shots on our team!”  Congrats @AntDavis23!! Love you, kid!!
We need you supporting these kids. Help pack, @Rupp_Arena #BBN. https://t.co/Ez9sm5avLi
My next read! https://t.co/XwXmWMJvzE
As I said tonight to our media, I'm glad it's just November. We've got a ways to go. But how about the November our @KentuckyVB and @UKMensSoccer teams are having?! Another @SEC championship for @UKCoachSkinner and his team while Johan and his guys are on to the Sweet 16!
How about @hamidoudiallo getting the start tonight for OKC!!! Proud of him. Playing well.
My UMass team in 1990 was proof of that. Don helped our team get into postseason for the first time since 1977 because he knew we deserved it.  There aren’t many people willing to help others, especially when they’re competitors. There aren’t many like Don. Congratulations!
One of the great guys in our profession, @SJUHawks athletic director Don DiJulia, retired recently and I want to congratulate him on a great career. Don is one of the best in all of athletics and cared about everyone – not just his own kids and coaches at St. Joe’s.
I’m always excited anytime there’s a player from our state who can come in and help this program and have an impact. Dontaie does all that for us.
.@dontaieallen11 is one of Kentucky’s finest. I love Dontaie’s ability to score the ball in different ways. He’s got a lot of skills with the ball in his hands and athleticism to play above the rim. https://t.co/7eCGE3ciCM
My longtime friend Paul Procopio. https://t.co/b2RxUHm6rM
Friends from my UMass days! https://t.co/ucmEApjMt4
Wait, you're telling me @KarlTowns is only 23 years old today?! Wow!!! Actually, now that I look at this pic, are we sure he's not younger?   Just kidding, Karl. Love you, kid. Happy birthday! https://t.co/gi4LpsUPEi
In all the time I’ve watched Tyrese play, rarely does he make the wrong play. He may not make every shot, but he almost always make the right play. You can tell that he’s a coach’s son. Physically he is going to be able compete with the best in the country.
.@TyreseMaxey has unbelievable competitive spirit. I love Tyrese’s basketball savvy. He has an elite ability to score the ball, yet he creates shots for his teammates, he defends and he rebounds. https://t.co/UxQWHV76U5
Happy birthday to @TwanyBeckham11, who I hear also released a book today! So proud of Twany and how driven he is. #BBN, check out his new book, "PRESSURE."   https://t.co/jAitzicOsO https://t.co/pnnWZxbXsQ
Hall of Famer Chris McCarron. One of the best, who’s won them all!! https://t.co/1Q5FYk7TKo
Two big babies, Erin and Brad. https://t.co/p4Fs79KZ9t
Just came across a few photos of @bradcalipari and our first Shepherd, Shelby.  Happy birthday, Brad!!! https://t.co/Oi2pJ4q1AV
Today, on #VeteransDay, let’s all reflect and give thanks to all those who make this the greatest country in the world. Thank you to everyone who demonstrates the ultimate act of servant leadership by putting their lives on the line to protect our freedoms. THANK YOU!!!
Johan and the guys get it done again!!! Wow!!!  #WeAreUK https://t.co/5jw1uQmDDN
Happy birthday to @bradcalipari, who is everything I would want in a son. He's driven and competitive, yet has a kind heart. It's been a great experience for me to coach him and watch him grow as both a person and a player. Love you, son! https://t.co/HCoOyApzy1
My boys from Moon High School! Robert Tipper wasn’t in the picture from earlier today but made it in for this one! https://t.co/c4GdmCmNeb
Some of my high school buddies are in for the game. Scott Morgan, Tom Broskey, Mike Bartels, Bill Mazar, Tim Miller, Gill Goodrich, Pat Hughes and Pat’s son, Jarrett. https://t.co/6D5laBHibX
Better enjoy! Happy birthday, @JonnyDavid! https://t.co/tRTT1sz638
When players try to establish themselves, that kind of game is usually what you get. One unit, one heartbeat, and it’s always a process.
I can assure you this has humbled our team and our staff. I can also assure you that I wouldn’t trade this team for anyone and I can’t wait until we start clicking collectively.
I’ve been in early season games like this one and been on both sides. Duke deserves a lot of the credit. They were outstanding. Having said that, we weren’t prepared physically or mentally as I thought we would be, and that’s on me.
It's a big day today! You want to know why? Because it's @DLamb20's birthday today!!! Happy birthday, Doron! https://t.co/NkVnoTb985
He will continue to be a part of our team this year and will still practice and travel with us. However, he will not play in any of our games.
My son, @bradcalipari, came to me about a month ago and asked me to redshirt this year. He’s graduating in three years with plans to go to grad school for two years here at Kentucky. This will give basketball eligibility during those two years of grad school.
I can’t remember if we won that game or not...
Team bus has ESPN and they’re showing UMass vs UNC from ‘93.  Wow!! https://t.co/Mf94u7jICL
Happy birthday to @TreyLyles, who is off to a great start this season in Denver! https://t.co/SnpQh0D9ZM
Had to vote before I left today!  Tuesday is a big day!!!! https://t.co/USmrdJXLYD
Wow, what a season for Johan and @UKMensSoccer. Keep it going into the postseason! https://t.co/4o5RqoTTpb
There a few people in my life that make me feel like I’m a little out of my league when I talk to them. My daughter @TheErinCalipari is one of them, but so is @dillonpulliam30. Everyone has a genius! Dillon IS a genius. Look at him in the @nytimes!   https://t.co/D4Ymi9Wve4
First career triple-double for @swipathefox and the youngest player to ever have go for 30+ points, 10+ rebounds and 15+ assists. Couldn’t be more proud! https://t.co/YBILTa8McB
.@drose goes for 50 in a Minnesota win. He also got the game-winning block! But the act that showed the most to me was his team’s response.  He is one of the best TEAMMATES I’ve ever coached. Proud of you, DRose, and love you! https://t.co/7kLEzmMJEC
Wow!!! @UKCoachSkinner and @KentuckyVB are getting it done! https://t.co/gS6BI1e2yf
So proud of how @swipathefox and @THEwillieCS15 are doing with the @SacramentoKings.   Are we looking at two all-stars?
The No. 1 job of every parent is to embarrass their children. #HappyHalloween https://t.co/xSa20WCOgd
John Montanez and my former AD at UMass, Bob Marcum! https://t.co/yEtXiG54TG
Happy birthday to Brenda Montanez, who is now a grandmother!!!
Wow, what a slate! #BBN, this is a special week. https://t.co/wrwrSNGMfr
The patriarch of a special family from Memphis, Marvin Ballin has passed away. A big loss in many ways. His son, Leslie, is a great and loyal friend. Ellen and I send thoughts and prayers to the family.  https://t.co/DkHPJlRCBy
Only 22 years old and he's already scored 70 points in a game and won the NBA 3-Point Contest. But he didn't start for us! Maybe he should have. What do you think, @DevinBook? Happy birthday, kid! Yes, you're still that young! https://t.co/adUn4esZU5
A dear friend, mentor and confidant of mine is having a big birthday today. Bob Marcum helped build not only our basketball program at UMass, but the entire athletic department. We’ve remained close and, not to make RC or Mitch mad, he may be one of the best ADs ever. Happy bday!
You women are crazy!!! https://t.co/ClPYo35Fnw
Also want to thank the Tulip Bistro &amp; Bar, AP Suggins Bar &amp; Grill, @MalibuJacksLEX, @adelelexington, @AJsCasuals, @bodystructureky, @cycleyou_lex, @ebf_kentucky, @Hourglasslex and the @weeklyjuicery for providing door prizes for our #WomensClinic attendees.
And finally, want to thank @MariaTaylor and @sportsiren for being our special guests. They were the stars of tonight’s clinic. I think they took more pictures with our attendees than even our players did. They’re the best. https://t.co/ER6gYz7Esn
The neat thing for me tonight is that we got to make a $10,000 donation to @UKMarkey to go towards breast cancer research.
Thank you to all of our sponsors for making this the best one yet. A special thanks to @CocaCola, @UK_HealthCare and @ALLSPORTSLEX for making tonight happen.
Another unbelievable #WomensClinic. Nearly 700 women came on a Sunday night and had a blast. I don’t know what it is about this team but I can’t tell you how many women came up to me and said what a great group we have. https://t.co/OdeQedvvg9
I couldn’t be happier for Mark and his team. And believe me, we are watching and learning from it.
Every year my goal is to have an empowered team where they understand it’s their team, not mine. @UKCoachStoops officially became empowered when @H_Huncho said, “Let me run back this punt.” Coach Stoops trusted him enough to say go for it. The rest, as we like to say, is history.
Double dose of birthdays today. Happy birthday to @DrewRoc5 and @AaronICE2! https://t.co/QHRWlf3bXc
This is our program for tomorrow’s Women’s Clinic. Ellen showing off! https://t.co/ujoofPajlv

Loved that we could honor C.M. Newton tonight. He was a giant in our game and his legacy will be felt for a long time. So much of C.M. in his son, Martin! https://t.co/xVA0XWnebg
After two days with me, Dr. Rotella is going to go lay down for a bit and then see a psychiatrist. https://t.co/ltleSIwfrI
Fantasy camper Rex McClanahan will be on our bench tonight! Bob Rotella is also in town helping me and the guys get our minds right. Our guys are excited to get on the floor tonight. https://t.co/2EPnrYobJm
Forgot to mention that we'll be making a donation from some of the proceeds to breast cancer research at UK Hospital!
Just received word that @IamHunterLisle of @AMLexington is going to provide vouchers for 3 free dance classes to EVERY attendee of the Women’s Clinic!! That’s just one of many prizes from local vendors we’ll be giving away at our all-new clinic! https://t.co/kV7AuGlV52
Remember, those that sign up can also attend the @KentuckyVB match at 1:30 p.m. After it's over, our vendors, which will include everything from food to massages to healthcare tests, will open up during check-in. Ellen and I may even have to bust out the snow cone machine!!! https://t.co/BaLjE3lYEK
Getting excited for our all-new Women's Clinic on Sunday. It just got even better with the additions of @MariaTaylor and @sportsiren! Let's show them the power of the #BBN!   Still time to register at https://t.co/5uRxKZHq31 https://t.co/9iZbdPXgke

We still have a few spots left in our all-new women’s clinic. We’ll have all the basketball stuff people love, plus local vendors and a chance to take photos with me and the real stars of our family - Ellen and the dogs!! https://t.co/wqzGwBKJxw
Sign up for yourself and then share the password with your staff, so they can watch and take notes too!   This isn’t about money, it’s about helping coaches and young players!   https://t.co/SntHIwIa2r
Coaches, due to overwhelmingly positive feedback and requests, we are going to extend the availability of our clinic video stream. It will now be available on https://t.co/tpnVeuv8BO until Thursday at midnight! https://t.co/A0VgAD02Lt
Stopped for soup and salad at Zoup on Fourth Street after the Greater Louisville Alumni Tip-Off Luncheon. The owner’s kids, Hayden and Hanna Gillis, are sophomores at UK. Really good!
Ellen and I are really happy for our two #BlueWhite scholarship winners, Kyle Brubaker from Richmond and Leann Calhoun from Grayson. Put it to good use!!! https://t.co/v5US4FlPrO
This is what it’s about and I’m so glad to already be hearing from coaches about how valuable today’s clinic was for them. I hope live-streaming is a way to keep connecting us all.  Let’s grow our game and help coaches at all levels to be better teachers!! https://t.co/qdRlhjHCKR
Unbelievable coaches clinic today!  Very excited and confident about our future clinics being streamed. Instead of coaches coming to us, we bring basketball to them!  Minimal cost vs. traveling to a site for coaches or fans.  And I t’s available for 72 hours!!   WHATS NEXT?
My college coach, Joe DeGregorio, stopped by practice with his wife, Emmy, and 6 family members.  His grandsons are students with us!! https://t.co/qRKtfmIIEX
Really proud of @ZayBriscoe, who made his debut last night for the @OrlandoMagic w/10 points &amp; 3 assists. I watched him this summer. He has improved so much and still has the same fight on defense that he had for us. Wasn’t an easy path but he absolutely deserves this opportunity
We have over 200 coaches signed up!! Coaches from 30 states and 6 from other countries!!  It’s not too late to sign up:  https://t.co/OMwEtlVDma https://t.co/F53ZsSsPj3
Tickets are available at https://t.co/QBhq2Fruj6 or by calling 800.745.3000. When you get to the game Sunday, use the BBN Rewards app to check in and you'll be eligible to win one of the scholarships. Plus, great chance to see what we've been working on in practice.
Calling all #BBN students: Ellen and I will be offering two scholarships for the 2019 spring semester for students who attend our #BlueWhite Game on Sunday. Tickets are just $5. Won't find better odds than this to win tuition!  https://t.co/8MRNFACuBm https://t.co/4NYdP4D9UF
We now have coaches from Norway and Canada signed up!!!  Join us for the global coaches clinic livestream:  https://t.co/OMwEtlVDma https://t.co/eEtVVKKVzu

Every morning, I’m greeted with a list of last night’s performances by our guys.   The NBA has started! https://t.co/DNnYqhNy5B
A very special woman and a high school classmate, Denise Current Criste, passed away suddenly last week.  A beautiful person with a beautiful voice. Sad. My prayers are with her family.    https://t.co/SwDFQnlExa
Half the states are signed up for our clinic. To encourage the other half, we’re adding Andy Kennedy, who is doing our Blue-White Game that evening, to teach his 1-3-1 defense. The way he coached it at Ole Miss is unique and I think people will enjoy it.   https://t.co/OMwEtlVDma https://t.co/z6gBBwiHY5
Just got off a plane and saw we have coaches now signed up from Texas, Georgia and North Carolina!!  Coaches, you don’t want to miss out on the first-ever global clinic livestream!  https://t.co/OMwEtlVDma https://t.co/DI2IDDRxoL
Good luck to all of our guys (including @drose and @TyrekeEvans) as they begin the 2018-19 year! Looking forward to seeing that sheet every morning of how our guys are doing. Two-thirds of the league has our guys on it! https://t.co/J2MWOoVnJB
We’ve got a coach from North Dakota!!!  Come on, South Dakota!!!   Montana is already in too!!  https://t.co/OMwEtlVDma https://t.co/URSV1cW6Bp

Patrick Baumann, the head of FIBA, passed away suddenly at age 51. A big loss for international basketball.  Keep him and his family in your prayers, #BBN.
What a special evening celebrating 50 years of the Urban League of Lexington-Fayette County and the wonderful work they do in our community.  And my friend, P.G. Peeples, has been there for almost all 50 years! https://t.co/Y6tpqOXRsa
We’ve only had the registration active for a few hours and we already have coaches signed up from 7 states too! Looking forward to making this a home run for everyone!
The coaches are already signing up for the coaches clinic livestream and I’m proud to say the first coach to sign up was from Australia!  Coaches, you can register here:  https://t.co/OMwEtlVDma https://t.co/TXHX5RdcrY
Fellow @Hoophall member, Rhodes Scholar &amp; three-term U.S. Senator Bill Bradley is coming to campus tomorrow. His topic for the 3:30 p.m. Wendell Ford Lecture will focus on when sports and politics intersect. It’s in the Gatton Student Center. Admission is free and all are welcome
I'm always looking for ways to reach out and connect with as many coaches and basketball fans as I can, from podcasts to social media to speaking engagements across the country. This is the next step. I think this is going to be a home run for everybody.
The livestream will also be available for 72 hours afterward to both those who sign up for the livestream and those who come in person. Livestream participants will be allowed to submit questions to @CoachCalDotCom on Twitter for us to answer throughout the clinic.
Got some exciting news for our Coaches' Clinic on Sunday. For those who can't make it in person, we will now be offering a livestream option. We are trying to create the biggest and the best worldwide clinic in the history of basketball. Be a part of it: https://t.co/gRGJOmRslZ https://t.co/6WSgqV8X7D
Had to try Gus’s World Famous Fried Chicken with Ellen tonight. Opened in Memphis when we were there and nothing has changed. Outstanding!
... They now know it doesn’t matter how they feel coming into a game or practice; they control their effort and intensity. I love it. Second practice starts at 4. (2/2)
This is why I like this team. We practiced this morning, the first of two practices. The anxiety and excitement from last night drained my team so they started slow but ended up having a great practice. ...  (1/2)
My good friend and great Kentucky supporter, Joe Craft, has a birthday today!!!  Have a great day, Joe!!
#LaFamilia https://t.co/tl9IjdCGM8
Wow, what a night!!! Thank you to all of our staff that put on this show, including @NathanSchwake and his team and all of the folks at @KYwildcatsTV. They put a lot of thought into this for the #BBN. It gets bigger and better every year. https://t.co/QrDO7m81q9
What did you think, #BBN? Can you believe this is the 10th season?! #BBM18 https://t.co/yFKcXO4se0

Happy birthday to Keldon! Turns 19 years old today. Love his spirit and his fight! https://t.co/qV1LRK1stu
#BBN, important information for you to review for this season. Please pay close attention!!! https://t.co/eUUebdOydl
Steve Rosenberry of the Atlanta Hawks lost his wife, Kathi, after over 30 years of marriage. They were truly made for each other and were one. A true basketball lifer, who has done so much for the game. I’ll be praying for both families. #BBN please join me. https://t.co/TUpQfyASee
We’ve had two big losses in our basketball family.  Bert Hammel was the coach at Merrimack College for 36 years and was a great coach and a great person. A real basketball Benny! Bert loved the game and what he did. https://t.co/TDd6MQHTDb

Lots of talk about entering my 10th season at UK, so I wanted to share the notes I took to my first press conference.   Putting players first, striving for titles, holding players accountable and making #BBN proud has never changed and it's created the culture we have now! https://t.co/wRU7a6NZ2Q
My mentor and friend Ken Bennett stopped in for the NBA combine!! https://t.co/kdhVWPXTZZ
Our combine ended today and all 30 NBA teams attended.  Keldon wanted to play, but I gave him the day off.   Among the guests, we had my first-ever recruit, Milt Newton from Kansas, who is now with Milwaukee. Also two of Kentucky’s own, Chuck Hayes and Tayshaun Prince! https://t.co/6TtD1epRV6
By the way, Keldon tweaked his ankle at the end but he should be OK.
I love how this team competes and battles, yet off the court they’re as close as any team I’ve coached.
I know you watched their competitive spirit and it makes you feel like, “Wow, are we really going to be good in a month.” That’s a good thought, but we’re not there yet.
Hope our fans enjoyed #UKProDay. I don’t want anyone to get too crazy. We still have a long way to go.
Ladies of the #BBN, we're moving our Women's Clinic back to Memorial this year so we can add a few new things. This year we'll have vendors for you on the concourse and an opportunity for you to watch the @KentuckyVB match earlier in the day. Sign up now! https://t.co/F3cJrLQLDK
Happy 30th birthday @drose! So proud to watch you grow into a man who cares about his family and others more than you do yourself! https://t.co/JcAMSGx8hT
Also we had a great poster for that season, which included Coach Rupp, who played at Kansas. https://t.co/GCuHS4UKie
I used to pound @CoachTadBoyle and @CoachTurgeon playing one-on-one!  You too Jeff Dishman!  Calvin, Carl, Ronny and the guys got theirs too.  Lol https://t.co/P5451rv5Ih
Wow!  Just got this program from Bob Turgeon.  Seems like yesterday. Cathy Gertler along with Mark Summers, Bob Hill, Ed Manning, RC Buford and some long haired guy.  Coach Brown’s staff. Great memories!   It’s where I met Ellen, who worked in the KU Athletic Dept. https://t.co/cqOPBDPlIa
Thank you @DoubleDogsLEX for bringing lunch by the office today for the staff!  The food is great and the staff is happy!!
Congratulations to @UKMensSoccer! I’m sorry I couldn’t be at the great win tonight. We had a late practice. Excellence is something hard to attain but this team is on the cusp of great things! https://t.co/4eDYvAKGHw
At the end we did a six-minute conditioning drill, and after it was over they all looked at me and said, “What’s next?” Could this be who we are daily? If it is ...
Really proud of this team I’m coaching. They fight and battle on every possession on that court, yet off the court they are about each other. Today was two-and-a-half hours of brutal hand-to-hand, hard-nosed scrimmaging, half-court defense, a lot of shooting and we went non-stop.
Let's pack @Rupp_Arena all season long! I know the #BBN will! https://t.co/hVGRvYruCS
Late night in the office with the boys. Nothing better than hearing balls bouncing in the gym!!!  There’s no magic wand.  You take what you want and you earn what you get!!!!! https://t.co/FM5zcQVmpT
Ambassador Kelly Craft in the Rose Garden today! https://t.co/NWypoomx4t
He was a supporter of many charities for the underprivileged, particularly Big Brothers/Sisters, H.O.P.E. Farm, Sisters of Nazareth, his church and many more. He lived a truly great life. #BBN lost a great one.
He was the author of the family-oriented book, Grounders, a touching recollection of a cross-country trip he took with his grandsons and a couple friends to visit various MLB baseball games, which demonstrated both his love of family and his character.
He developed Touchstone Communications, a worldwide system and was an adjunct professor at the University of North Texas. He was the founder of a charitable 501c3 organization, Little Big Shot, that involved groups of 10 shooting three-point shots as a fundraiser.
Tom was a Hoosier from Clark County but was a long time multiple season ticket holder who rarely missed a crucial UK game, though he and his wife, Fran, lived in the Fort Worth, Texas area.
Tom Slone died last night. I was just with him Wednesday. UK lost one of its best-ever fans and many, many people lost a great friend, employer, leader, teacher, and Christian brother who was a great family man.
#BBN, let's pack #TheBell on Wednesday! We've got another team rolling this fall! https://t.co/Erp9qNIZpg
So happy for Marvin and the @Bengals! Our team watched the end of the game before our second practice. We all went nuts as @H23Ash and @E_Montomery cried!   Happy for the Bengals. Now let’s go @steelers, who play at 8:30!
Kevin Massey and his family stopped by and surprised us at practice. He just finished up an internship and is on to the next step. He’s been a truly blessing for me and our program. https://t.co/vRT4HqiKG7
Great to have my friends from Wilmington, North Carolina, Jason Byrd, Berkeley Reed, Ryan Mahan, J.P. Blevins, Chip Mahan, Tyreece Hughes and Jimmy Mahan join us for practice today. https://t.co/ckIbt60g9n
My friend Phil Trenary was shot and killed today in Memphis. My heart and prayers go out to his family!  Just senseless.
Thought a lot about the Madden family today. I’ve had the privilege of becoming good friends w/Pat Madden during my time here and know what they mean to this community and what the community means to them. There will never be another like Anita Madden. She will be greatly missed.
#BBN, our annual Coaches' Clinic has been set for Oct. 21 at 10 a.m. We'll have a full day of instruction, Q and A, tour of the facilities, etc., PLUS you'll get tickets to our Blue-White Game later that night.   Register now at https://t.co/kiL01qGh4r https://t.co/4z86E2vX2Y
Stopped by the #BBM18 campout this morning after getting in to town and saw @McDonalds delivering food to our campers. Thank you to McDonald’s, @PapaJohnsUK, @ChickfilA, @CocaCola and Kentucky Strong BBQ for keeping our campers fed while they wait for tickets. https://t.co/PJM0bLg8GQ
Saying a prayer this morning for Wayde and the @LSUBasketball family. Very tough news to hear we've lost a young man just getting started. My condolences to his family, friends and teammates. https://t.co/K2yvrqfpbB
#BBN, I hate that I’m going to miss the #TentCity Live show tonight. I was on the road recruiting all day yesterday, I was at league meetings all day today and I’m going to a fund-raiser tonight for the Mike Slive Foundation. I hope to stop by and see everyone tomorrow though!
Happy birthday to @MKG14, one of the absolute greatest kids to put on that uniform for us!

#BBN does it again. A little rain isn't going to stop our fan base. #BBM18 #TentCity https://t.co/GAxOPE0kfk
Happy 88th birthday to Neil Riley, one of the queens of the #BBN! https://t.co/STMIBf3Gh4
In @mossteaksmke and saw this framed tablecloth on the wall. @LarryBrownSMU, @TomCrean and I were drawing up plays awhile back!! I still use some of those! https://t.co/kgewpJGY68
Had our friends from USC and Spendthrift Farm at practice today. Pictured from left to right: Al Cowlings, B. Wayne Hughes, Bill Lyons &amp; Eric Gustavson. Also met Mr. Hughes and his wife, Patricia, at our football game. They were still talking about how good we looked on Saturday. https://t.co/A4FU3YBCwx
Who popped into practice today?  @swipathefox , Joe Craft and @USAmbCanada.  Also my friend Jeff Lignelli, who’s not pictured. https://t.co/UFD45Ii2m3
So proud of our @UKFootball team, @UKCoachStoops and his staff. They believe in each other!! No doubt!!!
Just got off phone with @KarlTowns. So happy for him and his family on the new deal! Chase greatness!!!!
At the football game and ran into @GovMattBevin along with @USAmbCanada. Everyone is going crazy for @ukfootball! #WeAreUK https://t.co/d68veHNxRM
Anthony’s grandma sent this to me!  Wow. Look at what this job does to you. https://t.co/l7dFES8uUd
Last night it was @AntDavis23. Today it’s @Bam1of1 and @swipathefox. Love seeing my sons back in town. #LaFamilia https://t.co/5j7BDjHFnO
Anyone who has given to this country his entire life — from the Navy to our government — to make our country better, I respect. Party is irrelevant to me and I’m glad my team got to meet @JohnKerry today. https://t.co/vRNSWLH4EJ
Our 68th United States Secretary of State, @JohnKerry, is in town and going to watch our practice today. Loved his message to our team. https://t.co/V12NLIF7yP
Great speech by @AntDavis23. As he’s always done, Anthony made it about others. That’s what makes him special. Congrats to Anthony and his family on the special night. https://t.co/cPr71wQ0va
.@AntDavis23 is about to officially be inducted into our Hall of Fame! This moment is just as much about his family and friends as it is about him. Unbelievable support system. Congratulations to AD and his family. Proud of him! https://t.co/xW4C6XZdik
Happy birthday to Mark. He's the best in the business. Our kids love him and I lean on him for a lot more than just equipment. Bright mind and great person. Happy birthday, Mark! https://t.co/H3q2nuiCh5
I’m presenting @AntDavis23 at tonight’s UK Athletics Hall of Fame ceremony and I’m trying to get into the right mindset for my speech. Almost there. https://t.co/sg4D4E0Ven
Thank you @Pacers for sending me this jersey.  Couldn’t be more happy for @TyrekeEvans. What a great situation for him to shine! https://t.co/NpsIkAl7Ju
Must be a sign. Out for a walk and I saw my lucky number! https://t.co/x40rZ0xFbL
Had to make a pit stop to see the Yanks and Sox!!!  With two special people and friends, Lexington’s Brian Cashman and @mroctober. https://t.co/HZl7EssZJc
Happy 99th birthday Irene Keys, a big UK fan! https://t.co/YXpkJILti5
@KentuckyMBB @UKCoachStoops @PJWashington @JoshAllen41_ Tight end or rushing the quarterback?
Had to share a @CocaCola with my guy @UKCoachStoops!!    #BBN, let’s pack Kroger Field on Saturday and get behind this @UKFootball team!! https://t.co/m6eKcI7AN1
Great to reconnect with a true superstar tonight. I’ve known @jtimberlake for a long time and he’s never changed who he is or what he’s about. Great guy, great heart.  Unbelievable performance tonight! Ellen and I, along with some friends, had an incredible time at Rupp!! https://t.co/jAfCDjKOnJ
Quick pit stop after landing from recruiting. I’m the only person in the building dressed like a recruiter! https://t.co/t9IiBzwaJM
Always two of my favorite events. Details and registration coming soon! Got some exciting new additions to offer this year. https://t.co/VQFbsYz4R4
As you know, I’m not into eating (lol) but I stopped by @kitchencrayEmp in Lanham, Maryland.  Ridiculous!!!   Hats off to Chef Robinson. Joel had chicken and waffles.  I went light with shrimp and grits!!! https://t.co/DuiBe5ZCvr
Attention, #BBN ... https://t.co/DZsM2GPg2P
Looking forward to discussing leadership and team building with @VUCoachJWright and ESPN’s @MariaTaylor7 at #MedTechCon September 26 in Philadelphia. Thanks for the invitation @ScottWMedTech.
Heard about the passing of a family friend, Laura Rotella. She was a wonderful woman, who was a great wife to Guido and a loving mother to Dr. Bob, who has spoken to my teams for over 20 years. I will be praying for their family and I hope #BBN will do the same.
With a true champion, Bob Baffert. https://t.co/FRvpLo9Sq9
A really fun group. Hope you're enjoying these kids, #BBN. https://t.co/xCbj9csj2P
Another view of Mt. Rainier!! https://t.co/9TuYELBK9d
From day one, @AntDavis23 was committed to being a great teammate. Sharing that with EJ speaks to his character and shows how much our players care about our program AFTER they leave!  It’s about leaving the program better than you found it. It’s about building “up” the culture. https://t.co/QqPu2E15Xo
Nice view of Mt. Rainier!! https://t.co/VW1hYo4pfl
On my way out of town, I had to stop by George Klein’s!  GK is the best!!!  Miss having him in the locker room before games!!! https://t.co/O1qdayfCIG
Had to make a quick stop at @GibsonsDonuts to see the crew!  Minus my friend Glenda Stewart!!! https://t.co/yvb1bNPAre
Toasting Bud Chittom with friends at @BluesCityCafe. We already miss our friend!! https://t.co/OZ6KmoTuul
Happy birthday to @E_Montomery!  #BBN, you know what to do! https://t.co/NxnJLGvtmu
God bless this great country and all those who defend our country and all those who risked their lives to save others on that day 17 years ago. #NeverForget
The ability of our country to come together in times like those, to not give in to terrorists, shows there is nothing we cannot do when we come together.
Been traveling all day. Just got to my hotel room and looked at the date. Thinking back on 9/11, which changed not only our country but the entire world, I think of all the people who lost their lives and how their families were affected. My guess is their pain continues today.
Talked with both @DevinBook and his father about Devin’s hand surgery to let them know the prayers of myself and all of #BBN are with him in surgery and recovery. He’s got the right mindset to come back stronger than ever from this and I can’t wait to see him back on the court!
My good friend from Memphis, Bud Chittom, passed away. He was one of the best Beale Street operators EVER!  Also a kind man. He will be in my prayers.
Or maybe it should be “Karl of Duty”.  What do you think, @KarlTowns?
Erin, I was so good that they might rename it “Cal of Duty”.  And get back to work. We need you finding cures and answers, not following me on Twitter!  :-) https://t.co/h4ePbpeLSb
Thanks to our friends at @CallofDuty and @karltowns for letting us be the first college basketball team to check out #BlackOps4! https://t.co/25jzJlUSJu
This gets me more excited about our season and this team!! https://t.co/mk6FX1cKfM
How about that @UKFootball win!!  Love the fight that this team has!! Congrats to @UKCoachStoops, his staff and players. There are good things happening with that program!!
I got a gift in the mail today from @AntDavis23.  But, Anthony, you forgot something!! https://t.co/tNoXLAcMyP
Let me thank the @MGMSpringfield for helping us celebrate Jim Host last night. The hotel casino has only been open a couple weeks and the people involved did a fabulous job hosting. I want to give a special thanks to Stephanie for setting everything up.
Had a chance to read an advanced copy of "Gridiron Genius" by Michael Lombardi. Anytime you can write about what you learned from Bill Walsh, Al Davis and Bill Belichick, it's worth reading. Lot of good nuggets I took from the book.   https://t.co/r4Ss0imWDx https://t.co/AsyzprIpsS
Always fun to spend time with great friends.  With Chris Woolard, JoAnn Scott and Danny Gavitt. https://t.co/nvnpd2B4SZ
Had a great time last night celebrating Jim Host receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from the @Hoophall.  Jim was a game-changer for college athletics!! https://t.co/lWSnalIsoX
Spent some time tonight talking with James P. Naismith and his wife, Beverly.  James is the grandson of Dr. James Naismith!! https://t.co/nkpNLvKeLo
With @jjbareapr and family!! https://t.co/2EeO0uBIFe
Had a great time tonight honoring UK grad Jim Host, who received the John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award from the @Hoophall.  Jim has done some much for our game and it was great sharing stories with him and with fellow Hall of Famer Tom Jernstedt. https://t.co/7wuExCQ48g
Great time catching up with friends tonight at the @Hoophall!! https://t.co/eVMR7MIYwB
Made a trip to Springfield, Mass. for the @Hoophall festivities and ran into a pair of Kentucky legends!!  These guys put a lot of smiles on our fans’ faces!! https://t.co/FeSeoScEh9
Happy birthday to two of the greatest kids to come through our program here, @JohnWall and @AlexTheGreat22! https://t.co/lWcIupWGXE
Thanks to House of Cue in Irvine for bringing lunch by the office for our staff. Great food!!
Thanks again to the Pittsburgh Basketball Club for including me in their Silver Anniversary Hall of Fame class.  It was a real honor to be among so many Western Pennsylvania legends and to be honored in a place that means so much to me!! https://t.co/5EDfmxRNe9
I’m looking forward to seeing how he can grow this role to take our recruiting efforts to the next level.
.@BradyKennedy_ has been with us for a while now in various roles and has always stood out for his hard work and versatility. When he came to me with some ideas of some ways we can do things more efficiently, I was all for it.
Ultimately we get who we are supposed to get and they come here because of the success we’ve had with our players on and off the court, but we are always looking for ways to improve the consistency of our message and managing how we are delivering it to potential future players.
Recruiting will always serve as the lifeblood of our program. I think our success in getting &amp; developing kids over our time here speaks for itself, but as our game continues to change, we wanted to have someone who would oversee what we’re doing from an organizational standpoint https://t.co/IoAzqvgZlQ
Saw this and it reminded me of @TheErinCalipari and @MeganteCalipari. https://t.co/dCHmOvoYgi
Congratulations to my longtime friend Marilyn Masterson on winning a world championship!! She and her husband, Ken, have been great friends of ours for years. https://t.co/euYVR8LCxb
Here is the press release on Erin’s paper.  So proud of you, @TheErinCalipari!!     https://t.co/PAHlZPSN1L
I am so proud of @TheErinCalipari and the work that she is doing!! https://t.co/vO4f5yzaLT
With CA Smith for my annual stop at Smith’s in Collins, Missouri. It’s just outside of Osceola and if you are driving down highway 54, it’s a must stop!!! https://t.co/XWqIvf5WKy
Congratulations to @DakariJohnson for earning an invitation to @usabasketball’s training camp for the World Cup Qualifying Team. I’m so proud of how hard Dakari continues to work and I know his best basketball is still ahead of him. Go earn that spot, Dakari!
In the end, I hope that is what we’ve done for the families we’ve crossed paths with. That’s changing our little corner of the world and I’m so appreciative of Kentucky for allowing me the platform to do it.
It’s hard to change the world as a basketball coach, but you can change the direction and opportunity of the lives you touch.
For me, I feel less worthy. I hit the lottery by being born in the family I was born into and the country I was born in, at the time I was born.
Talent combined with a strong sense of responsibility guided their lives. Both spoke truth to power in their own way, while neither were afraid to take a position that wasn’t popular. Think of the lives changed because of them! That’s what both funerals screamed to me!!
I watched many hours of the funerals of Aretha Franklin and John McCain. As we move farther away from those celebrations of life, my mind shifts to who’s next in those fields to pick up their mantle?
At my brother in law Mike’s 60th birthday. Decided to bring out old reliable!! No @TheErinCalipari or @MeganteCalipari to serve though!! https://t.co/nvMr1e2ZZD
Debbie Wise (Fryz) and her kids. Her brother Joe was my big brother in high school. https://t.co/X8sJqyo9Dr

Got to spend time today with Dap Porter, Micky Martin and Kirk Bruce.  They were all stars at Pitt. https://t.co/IVekdRxwnb
Uncle Jim, Aunt Carol, Aunt Linda and Aunt Alice, who turns 91 on 9-1!  Had lunch at Harold’s with Aunt JoAnn and Aunt Julie but no pics!   Love the family!! https://t.co/YSVli9XHkU
Had to walk The Point this morning. Here are four pictures that give you the views.   Gotta love Pittsburgh!!! https://t.co/FOYMlEkqhL
Much of who I am as a coach and person is because of my upbringing and the relationships that were formed on the basketball courts throughout Pittsburgh and the surrounding communities. Being recognized, along with so many other Western Pennsylvania greats, is truly an honor. https://t.co/w7CgSXVxZO
Tommy Broskey, my friend and classmate from high school. Great competitor. https://t.co/zKZUaMXxt2

You can register online for the Dv8k until 7pm tomorrow night.  You can also register in-person at @DV8Kitchen on Friday from 3-7pm, or at Keeneland on Saturday morning from 6:30-8am.
My friend Rob Perez is doing wonderful work with his restaurant, @DV8Kitchen.  I’m so happy for him.  They’re hosting the Dv8k Life Changing Run on Saturday at Keeneland.  For more information, visit https://t.co/UYgkhigDCa.
Wanted to wish @CodySiciliano a happy birthday again. We celebrated last week but today is his actual birthday. https://t.co/tIz68Q8L8q
Congratulations to @DickieV, Jim Nantz, Bob Costas and all of the inductees of the 2018 Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Thank you for all you do for athletics.   https://t.co/n0p2qRMCls

Wanted to wish @UKMitchBarnhart a happy belated birthday. Mitch celebrated on Monday. What he's done for our department and our student-athletes during his tenure has been incredible. https://t.co/V3pNlmEAya
We visited the #OceanResort Casino in Atlantic City. Heard great things and we weren’t disappointed!!! Great place! Good job, Bruce! https://t.co/tq2D78ns5i
It’s not too late for the Big Blue Nation to pack Kroger Field for next Saturday. Mark’s got a special group this year. Don’t let those kids down! https://t.co/wZ19NmTJJf
@MeganteCalipari That wasn't supposed to be seen!  Neither one of us are old enough to go in public in those shirts!
Ralph and Donna Peterson are celebrating their 38th wedding anniversary today. Way to go you two!
Our goal in creating a schedule is to test our team while creating opportunities to learn and grow. This one will have more than its fair share of challenges, but my hope is that be season's end, we are prepared to play anyone and face anything a team tries to throw at us.
This could be the most difficult schedule we've played in my time here. The only teams we left off were the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers. I will say this: For as tough as our schedule is going to be, I believe we have the type of team and kids to play it. https://t.co/oFo2yd4j5T
Happy birthday to @PJWashington. Will be a little late on the birthday brownies but Ellen and I will get them to you when we get back to Lexington! https://t.co/EIsZ7LBpqW
Happy birthday @CodySiciliano!!! https://t.co/15FOQr8s9d
Staying at @Colonnade, as always.    Rooftop pool and hanging with family.  What’s better than that??
We had dinner and celebrated @CodySiciliano's birthday a little early... I think. https://t.co/o1uACWPrXc
Having dinner in Boston and looking at my lucky number - 888. https://t.co/5UWafTgMXE
Made a stop to see @MeganteCalipari and @mcotton88.  We went to Boston Commons and Megan fed the squirrels. I'm having dinner with them and @CodySiciliano tonight.   Players come back to campus this week. Can’t wait to get restarted with this group! https://t.co/ixxjpKr4Qk
Mark Scalf was a student with us and is now the UNC Wilmington baseball coach with 910 wins. Wow!!! https://t.co/0xdvsId1uH
At dinner for the Wilmington reunion. Great group of guys. Forty years later and we still stay in touch. https://t.co/IiCT2Nie03

It’s @THEwillieCS15 birthday today. Happy birthday to Willie!
Happy birthday to @A1Laflare10! #BBN, please join me in wishing him a happy birthday!
I know this has been a tough week for @realjamesyoung and his family but I hope he has a chance to enjoy his birthday today. Happy birthday, James. Continuing to think and pray for you and your family.
Happy four-year anniversary to @TheErinCalipari and her husband, @CodySiciliano. Proud of you both!
So proud of our medical team! https://t.co/U2j3RMZH18
I’m heartbroken to hear @realjamesyoung’s grandmother has passed away. I know how close James was with her. Sending condolences to James’ family and saying a prayer for them today.
Got to my office tonight and got worried because I noticed that, for the first time all summer, I didn't hear balls bouncing in the gym.  Then I realized all my guys went home to see their families.   I'm so proud of how hard they've worked and the way they played in the Bahamas.
Ric Elias hit two free throws to win the championship and was one of several award winners from Team @AriaLV.  Overall MVP - Jason Streeter  Assistant Coach of the Camp - Don Harmon  Tourney MVP - Lorenzo Clark  Top Executive - Ric Elias   Top Defensive Player - Jason Streeter
Congratulations to our champions, Team @AriaLV, coached by Jerry Wainwright.    Asst. coaches:  Marie Dzuris, Don Harmon, Woodford Webb, @H23Ash and @2ReidTravis2.  Players:  Stephen McFayden, John Sutton, Jason Streeter, Tom Galloway, Lorenzo Clark, Brad Berger, Ric Elias.
This year's fantasy camp in the Bahamas was just that - a fantasy. Great week for everyone involved and it was truly a family affair this year as wives and children enjoyed the experience. One camper - Brad Berger - had 14 family members with him! Thank you to everyone involved.
Congratulations to Jerry Wainwright for winning Coach of the Year at fantasy camp.  Two up-and-comers, @dandakich and @franfraschilla, showed some promise...but @SethOnHoops is on the hot seat after two years of going 0-3!
I want to give a shout out to the traveling #BBN. All of you who made the trip to the #BigBlueBahamas to support this team made it a week to remember. My hope is that it was as good of a trip for you as it was for the team and all of us. THANK YOU!!! https://t.co/vYutVVv1UH
Happy birthday to @boogiecousins! Can't wait to see him back on the court!
I love how well we are playing, especially bc it’s only August, but I’m not intoxicated by this. It’s a great starting point, but that’s all it is. My advice to our fans is to enjoy this and stay in the moment. Let’s finish out the trip strong vs. Team Toronto. #BigBlueBahamas
The third thing is we wanted to figure out where we are at this point after 10 practices. We are probably a little further ahead than what I thought, but make no mistake, #BBN, we still have a long ways to go.
The second thing is we needed to see some strengths and weakness, both individually and as a team, and what would work and what wouldn’t. We’ve definitely found some of that out.
We did this trip to bring this group of players together – and they have done just that. Part of that is because they are so into basketball that they are comfortable in their own skin, which makes it easy to be about other guys.
Congratulations to my friend Craig Silver on completing the Pan Mass Challenge, a two-day, 165-mile ride that raises money for Dana Farber Cancer Institute. More than $50 million was raised during the weekend. Tremendous cause!  https://t.co/gvyCjSpgXE
This is a way for us to raise more money for charity and include #BBN.
We are doing this to thank all of the people who traveled with us and on their own and sacrificed to be here. If you want to be involved, great. If you don’t, we understand. Tickets are donated and all proceeds are going to charity.
As you come to the arena tonight, there will be signage to buy the raffle tickets. And even if you aren’t coming to the game tonight and are in the #BigBlueBahamas, you can still come to the box office and purchase one.
There will be two separate winners for games against top-10 and maybe even top-five teams. We will announce the winners at halftime of Sunday’s game.
Raffle tickets will be $50 and will be limited to the folks in the #BigBlueBahamas, many of who don’t have tickets in Rupp Arena (and if they do, don’t have courtside seats). Fans can purchase as many raffle tickets as they would like until we run out.
As a thank you to our fans who made the #BigBlueBahamas trip and an opportunity to play a part in our foundation work, we are going to raffle two courtside tickets (plus parking) for both the Tennessee and Auburn games tonight at the box office before, during and after our game.
Our fantasy camp and foundation have generated $10 million over the last seven years. We are hoping to increase that number again this year. https://t.co/efZYf3rCrR
Had a lot of fun spending time with Walt Lunsford, Jacob Yunker, Tom Kirk, Michael Hawk, Larry England, Jamie Laviola, Ryan Shrout, Stephen McFayden, Ken Brakebill, Doug Wilson, Caden Laviola and Donna Kirk.
Our fantasy camp is off to a great start here in the #BigBlueBahamas. Had coffee with the Captain’s Club this morning, all of whom have made a major impact on our camp and foundation. We talked basketball and the future of our game. I had a ball! https://t.co/Vz6LGAHvTO
Happy belated birthday to all three. Glad Tony and Robes could get out on the golf course yesterday and enjoy the off day! https://t.co/uQ1xxpiBcy
Happy birthday to @KevKnox!!! Mrs. Cal would make some birthday brownies and send them your way but no way to do so from the #BigBlueBahamas! LOL! #BBN, let’s wish Kevin a great day.
Love how much fun our guys were having yesterday. This is a really fun group to be around.  #BigBlueBahamas https://t.co/4fODc5th3h
Had an unbelievable time with the guys this morning out on the sea with some of the #BBN in the #BigBlueBahamas. There’s no crying on the yacht!!! (Thank you to @DrMikeUK for the photo!) https://t.co/zEf32rhjFK

Congratulations to @MarkKrebsJr and @ClareBilasKrebs on the birth of their second son!  Welcome to #LaFamilia, Vance Krebs!
With Mark Lyons, who has taken on the task of carrying on a great tradition at @Alltech that his father, Pearse Lyons, built. Pearse built Alltech out of nothing into a multi-billion dollar company. I’m so happy Mark and his staff could be here. https://t.co/q5nXUWHRco
And players come to Kentucky to learn about SERVANT LEADERSHIP and what true joy is. https://t.co/oiGGumBmvT
Players come to Kentucky because of our FAMILY. https://t.co/BrIW62qx4p
This is one of the reasons you come to Kentucky – to play on the biggest STAGE across the world. https://t.co/lScrA41yTb
I'm really enjoying spending time with our fans down in the Bahamas.  Got to hang out with Baron Crum and Kinzer Crum, who are down here with their parents.  They're having a blast! https://t.co/EFkfGYK1mY
I hope our guys learned today that fame that impacting others and making lives better makes life truly joyful. https://t.co/nJ45TkswWF
To wash the feet and put shoes on someone who may not have any with @Samaritans_Feet today was the ultimate lesson in servant leadership for our guys. How do you make a difference in other people's lives and bring true joy? Incredibly powerful morning. #ShoesOfHope #CountToZero https://t.co/a5Qz1Fvt28
A big part of why this trip is important is because it's an opportunity for us to grow closer as a team and to understand what it means to wear "Kentucky" on your chest.  I am seeing some really good things so far. https://t.co/RUzyOjvtmn
Big congrats to Joe Fredrick and his son Joey Fredrick on his marriage to Lexington's Laura Hayes. Joey lived in the Lodge while at UK. Check out the best groomsman dance ever ! https://t.co/Prtu8WAqUM

Enjoyed meeting a family full of UMass alums this morning. The DiGiammarino family has 13 family members who have all gone to UMass. Here are some of them: Robin ‘76, Peg ‘75, Peter ‘75, Frank ‘92, Frank Sr. ‘55, Catherine ‘22, Carol ‘92 and Paul ‘76. https://t.co/yuQC67vWdE
I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.    And don't be like @TheErinCalipari and say "TLDR💩"  I know it's long.  Read it!
The summer days I spent competing on the courts at Moon High, Blackhawk High and Beaver Falls High taught me about more than just basketball and shaped how I interact with others and see the world.  It's why I love this game.
I received this today from my friend Clint Hurdle and wanted to share it with you.  People often ask me how I fell in love with the game of basketball and this piece, written by John Leone, sums it up much better than I ever could.   https://t.co/gY58Zouzls
Congratulations to @derek_willis33 and @keelypotts_, who are getting married this evening. Wish I could have been there tonight but getting the team ready for the Bahamas. Still remember Derek going to one knee on Senior Night!
I know our fans who are there are going to be there. Should be fun! https://t.co/veWbmeSZmh
I love that our guys are having fun and that BBN is getting to see their personalities, but this better never happen again!!! https://t.co/sTnYL3upTL
I want to send a special thanks to Penny Cox and James Frazier, who work in our president's office, for helping us make this camp FREE for family members of UK staff.  I hope the children and grandchildren of our staff know how important their families are to all of us.
We had an unbelievable couple of days with our Draft Academy camp!  Nearly 400 kids took advantage of a chance to be with @shaiglalex, @KevKnox, @hamidoudiallo, @WenyenGabriel, @JVando and @ZayBriscoe.  It was a great camp where most of the attendees were family of UK staff.
I know everyone likes to talk about Tyler's ability to make shots, but he's shown a great commitment to being a complete player already.  Very excited to watch him grow this year. https://t.co/CbRGyfiFNp
I could go on and list every guy I've coached who is doing great things in his community, but it would go on for so long that you would send me the same thing that @TheErinCalipari does - "TLDR 💩".
So proud of @drose for doing this.  One of the great teammates and servant leaders that I’ve coached.  This scholarship shows me that our guys are listening when we teach them that making it about others is what makes your life the most fulfilling. https://t.co/flgcxEmLRY
Love seeing our guys back for camp. What I love most about the next two days is we can reward the employees of this university who make it so special by letting their kids in. We want to show them how much we appreciate all they do to make UK the gold standard. #LaFamilia https://t.co/OuxFbdVzoY
So proud of @WenyenGabriel. He took advantage of his opportunity and will do the same with this. Happy that all five of our guys who went to the pros this year signed deals. Plus @ZayBriscoe going to Orlando and @derek_willis33 going overseas! https://t.co/lrPTHyo26e
Happy birthday to @hamidoudiallo, who is one of the greatest kids I've ever coached and has a bright future ahead of him.  Hami is in town this week for our camp, so we'll have to get him some brownies! https://t.co/7l8hk7r05H
I can't wait for my guys to get in town and work with the campers and meet our new team. It's going to be a great couple of days.  And we still have 10 spots left in camp! If your child hasn't joined us at a camp this summer, don't miss out!  Register: https://t.co/DYD7zEFBfo https://t.co/AVQkUeEZsM
An extra special thank you to Kenny Troutt and Elliott Walden at @WinStarFarm. They had Jack Mullkin host our fantasy camp golfers after a great day of golf. WinStar Farm is beautiful and Kenny and Elliott are the best! Glad to call them friends!
The Marksbury family has been great supporters of UK. Lee and his wife, Stacie, helped sponsor our fantasy golf tournament again this year. Thank you! They even brought their baby boy, Griffin, to @WinStarFarm tonight. https://t.co/zPEdJP77Je
My dear friend Chris Arington with his daughters Sarah and Jessica. Chris helped sponsor our golf tournament. Once again comes through. He is a true blessing to many as is the Arington family. https://t.co/PacBmCCi66
With Jude Thompson, Brian Hart, Laura Wince and Jeremy Poston. Jude is starting a new company called Game On. Excited for him and his team. Great things ahead! https://t.co/MmUPApbQQE
Thanks to Chef Alan, Bruce Drake and Brian McCarty from the Bluegrass Hospitality Group. They provided a fantastic meal for us at beautiful @WinStarFarm after our fantasy camp golf outing, which is a part of next week’s fantasy camp in the #BigBlueBahamas. https://t.co/upFeNMTmOU
Loving what I’m seeing out of this group. Also, just got the uniforms in for the #BigBlueBahamas. What do you think, #BBN? https://t.co/NtdWg4k6nI
Got a lot done in two hours, including defense for the first time this summer. If we are going to be special, defense and rebounding will be the key. Lots of experimenting and lots of fun.
Had our first of 10 days of practice yesterday before the Bahamas. I continue to be impressed with this group’s toughness and work capacity.
Look who is back in town: @IsaacHumphries7!!! What an awesome kid who had a great first season in Australia. Love that he’s going to be around for the next week. https://t.co/ariwav8nt2
My good friend Mike Gottfried stopped by today on the way to Morehead State with Team Focus. https://t.co/gTgOd5I59P
I want to wish @EricLindsey7 a happy birthday.  Eric has been a very valuable member of our staff for several years and he always does what is best for our players and our program.  Happy birthday!
Ashton made a decision to reclassify and join our team this year because he wanted to compete with the best every day in practice.  That's just who he is.  He's a great teammate and I can't wait to watch him grow as a player this season. https://t.co/YrVCUBhBSd
#BBN, there is still time to register for our Draft Academy camp next week, Aug. 1 and 2. @hamidoudiallo, @WenyenGabriel, @shaiglalex, @KevKnox and @JVando will all be back for the camp.   Sign up now at https://t.co/cd7lpBjzUH. https://t.co/nuDOREXNZB
Two boys born into the Long family! Keith and Michelle welcomed Dylan George Long and Travis and Kim had Kaden Daniel Long. Amazing that they were born within 12 hours of each other. Congrats!
I love that the interest in our sport is what it is today. They’re all learning how to be coached, how to work, how to win and how to handle losing. As a coach, what more can you ask for? Love it!
Was in the gym in Orlando today in a terrific facility with countless gyms and thousands of kids. Even though we aren’t recruiting most of the kids, my whole thought today was how much all of the kids care about the game. They want to get better.
My first point guard at UMass, Cary Herer. Tough as nails! Worked as hard as anyone! https://t.co/b420RtTo05
.@hamidoudiallo has signed a three-year deal with the @okcthunder!!! I'm telling you, perfect spot for Hami. Couldn't be happier for one of the greatest kids!
.@BrianLong32, who played on the 2012 national championship team, was recently promoted at his job with Aerotech. Proud of you!
Two special parents who raised a special young man in @karltowns! https://t.co/ZYGGabocQX
Congratulations to @JalenRose and @MollyQerim! Wishing you both a lifetime of happiness. https://t.co/5I0TYDhQyH
So impressed with the turnout for @BarbasolChampKY today! The Bluegrass now has another signature event on the calendar to showcase Central Kentucky to the world. And Saturday is @universityofky See Blue Day so #BBN go out to Champions at Keene Trace and wear blue!
Happy birthday to the “Big Chill,” Ed Schilling, a Butler basketball Hall of Famer and Five Star legend. Hope you’ve had a great day my friend!
Our best teams are shaped by competition in practice.  Keldon has been bringing it every day and has helped set a tone for how we compete. https://t.co/gRKTb9ErPh
Happy birthday to Kathy Duggan!  From my UMass days!
Want to wish @Bam1of1 a happy birthday!  He is a great young man who continues to represent all that we teach our players to be on and off the court. Happy birthday! https://t.co/tVst7uQUNF
Stopping by Christ the King Church to pay last respects to John Palumbo.  Everyone who has ever met him is going to miss him.   https://t.co/cxPggS5Iq7
Joe Palumbo’s grandfather, John Palumbo, passed away today. A good man who built a great life for him and his family in Lexington. He was a WWII veteran and a successful businessman. I drive on Palumbo Dr. on the way to Hamburg. Thinking about the Palumbos today. https://t.co/NWEzqdrLS0
In New York and guess who pops in the gym? @hamidoudiallo! @okcthunder got a gem. Watch! https://t.co/EZ9cSUisqW
I love hearing from all the coaches at Peaxh Jam about @ZayBriscoe and his 4-year deal with @OrlandoMagic. These coaches know how important he was to our team and Orlando is getting a winner. Every player is on his own path. Isaiah took advantage of his.
Remember, dependents of non-salary UK employees can attend this camp for FREE. Just need to sign up! https://t.co/IXqKhyG6j1
.@shaiglalex’s birthday today! Have a great day, Shai. No brownies in Vegas! https://t.co/XNXXS1vTf5
We demand a lot of our point guards and Immanuel has already shown a commitment to being a great teammate.  Excited to see him on the court this year. https://t.co/BnAI5nsBaA
So happy for @JVando. He only played 14 games but he showed he has an NBA motor. As he gets healthy, people are going to say, wow! Just like they did with @BeMore27, the @nuggets made a GREAT pick. https://t.co/AVS4KxRR3Q
Really happy for Chad Sanders, who is being promoted to general manager of the Toronto Raptors' G-League team. Chad got his start with us as a graduate assistant and then played a vital role in the rise of the Dominican Republic national team. One of the hardest workers around.
Who wants to go to the Bahamas!? ☀️🏖️🍕Enter the @PapaJohnsLex Basketball in Paradise Sweepstakes for your chance at a trip to the @atlantisbahamas Resort with my Basketball Fantasy Experience. For complete details and how to enter, visit https://t.co/1vqIW3wLAX. https://t.co/pLfhO92bTd

Slice had a son!!! Rowan Sean Rohrssen was born 2:45 p.m. Congratulations to Slice and Kerry!
No-shows will not to be eligible for future scholarships!
If you’re a UK employee considering signing your child up, we ask that you please honor the commitment because other children could use this scholarship. There are a limited number we can offer and they will come on a first-come, first-served basis.
This camp is open to everyone, but I’m really excited to be able to offer this camp to our UK family. This is a great opportunity for some of the folks that make this campus what it is to provide something special for their children before school starts back up. https://t.co/IXqKhyovrt
Just heard we've lost one of the best to ever put on a Kentucky uniform. Frank Ramsey was one of the all-time greats and the original Sixth Man in the NBA. #BBN, please keep him and his family in your thoughts and prayers. https://t.co/AFOr4dsm0C
My mother-in-law Sue Higgins of Osceola, Missouri, has a birthday today. Have a great day, Sue!
Happy birthday, @H23Ash! Birthday brownies are on the way when Mrs. Cal gets back in town. https://t.co/HX8AOqWM9O
The speed with which we have to learn and adapt is hard. It’s all hard, but it’s what ties us all together and make/ it rewarding for everyone involved, including ME! Thanks, guys!!!! #LaFamilia
Only players who have been through this truly understand how hard it is to play at Kentucky. The grind is hard. Sacrificing is hard. Dealing with the NOISE is hard. Trusting the process is hard. Everyone is on their own path and timetable, which makes it hard.
Happy for @ZayBriscoe, one of the toughest fighters we’ve ever had, getting a multiple-year contract in Orlando. He will will himself and his team into something special. Lots of games to watch in the next few days!
Sitting with some of the vets brought back great memories. I’m really excited to see the young players play and show what they’ve got.
#LaFamilia! Having dinner with all the guys, what stood out with some of the them who I hadn’t see in a while is how great they look physically. They understand what it means to be a professional. https://t.co/svUuIl77G5
By the way, I let our current guys go home for the weekend to spend some time with their families. Most of our guys have been on campus for a month and have been GREAT.
I’m watching 13 summer league games in the next two days. Will see about 12-13 at dinner tonight. Looking fwd to seeing all of our guys!!! I’m excited to see everyone and have them tell me I held them all back and subbed them on every missed shot!! Oh, and that I yelled? Really??
Couldn’t be more happy for the @KevKnox family! https://t.co/fGrawSou99
We strive to bring young men into our program who are great basketball players and also great people.  EJ definitely fits that mold. https://t.co/wTokopzUuE
I want to wish everyone in the #BBN a happy #4thofJuly. I hope everyone has a chance to celebrate our country’s birthday with family and friends. And please be safe today!
We also wish @UTCoachFlo well at Texas. Edrick took our track program to places we never dreamed of and he will be missed as a colleague and a friend.
Congrats to our new track coach, @rolando_greene. Ellen and I welcome Lonnie and LaTayna to the Kentucky family. #WeAreUK
Normally I don’t do this but I’m going to the NBA Summer League to watch a few of our guys. After 30 of our guys played in the regular season last year, we’ll have 14 in the summer league.
DeMarcus isn’t the only one of our guys getting new starts. @NerlensNoel3 to OKC, @J30_RANDLE to New Orleans to play alongside @AntDavis23, which gives them a heck of a 1-2 punch and keeps them on the path they're on, and @RajonRondo to LA. Can’t way to see where @tulis3 ends up.
What an opportunity for @boogiecousins. I love the idea behind why he did what he did: He wants to win a championship. He did it to be able to play with really good players. He did it here at Kentucky and he did it with the Olympic team. One of Ellen’s favorites.
Johnny Palumbo’s 12th birthday. Happy birthday, Johnny! https://t.co/2IP7W88bxZ
It’s my son-in-law @mcotton88's birthday. He’s been a great husband to @MeganteCalipari and son to Ellen and me.

Ray Mills at our Wayne County High School Satellite Camp! Ray played for Coach Rupp from 1954-57. https://t.co/Udj2CHaW1u
Weeks like this week are what get me up in the morning. Love being on that court with young people and that basketball. Nothing better! https://t.co/SEf1G86jlP
Shout out to Jodi Black on her birthday today!! Have a great day!!  You too, Hank!!
GK, you are on my daily prayer list, my friend. Miss you!
Just got off the phone with a dear friend George Klein from Memphis. Most know GK as part of Elvis Presley’s Memphis mafia. I know him as a basketball junkie who helped me coach my team. His Sirius radio show was the best Elvis show with the best insight and personal touch.
Our staff also had a chance to spend time with Tom Arington, founder and chairman of @PrascoAGs. Great man and a big UK supporter! https://t.co/5BdvcHL1lT
They tell me their pro, @Anewell28, is pretty good!
My coaching staff supporting the @PrascoAG’s Charity Championship today in its pro-am event! https://t.co/gq3ZPDMKcS
Rising star! DeWayne has earned everything he has coming for him. Happy to call him a friend. https://t.co/fb7eBNZAmP
Sitting here thinking about just having 30 dogs run through my office. Please, no one say I hate elephants.
Seriously though, if you know my family, you know we love animals.  I'm proud to be a supporter of @lexingtonhumane and the work they do.  5,000 adoptions every year! https://t.co/6w86qwYit2
You see what happens when McGruff and Palmer get mad at me?  I had visitors waiting for me in my office today!  Thank you, @TODAYshow and Louisville fans! https://t.co/RPy8PYmzgw
Had a really great first practice with the team today.  I've challenged them to be like the 2014-15 team and not have a bad practice all season.   I hope they're ready to go tomorrow! https://t.co/hOxYZB2zOj
Just finished our first practice of the year with our team.  We have a long way to go, but we have an unbelievable group. https://t.co/9sCHNsig0i
Just talked to one of the toughest and most competitive players I’ve ever coached, @ZayBriscoe!  He is with the Orlando Magic working to make their club. I’m getting great reports!
Did I hear it's @Dhawk_25's birthday? #BBN, join me in wishing him a happy one. Dom had a great start to his professional career overseas. He knows what it takes! Grinder and great kid!
Just stopped in my office. @Q_Green1 was working out in a full sweat. And this shows up from @BravoTopChef Nice!! https://t.co/yFsRYBH5Mk
And if you didn't know, Rick is one of the best in our business.  He's won nearly 800 games as a head coach!
10 years ago today, I had the privilege of sitting in the green room as @drose was taken #1 overall in the NBA Draft. He was outstanding for our program, but remains an even better person.  He was joined by @JohnWall, @AntDavis23 and @KarlTowns as #1 picks, but Derrick was first! https://t.co/p2EL41mI4E
Spent some time with @BelmontMBB head coach Rick Byrd and his assistant, @THolloway4, talking movement, spacing and cutting.  Really got me thinking.  Can't wait to meet with my staff and talk about our team.
We're coming to Wayne County High School on Saturday for our Satellite Camp. This is the final opportunity of the camp season to attend one of our Satellite Camps. We've still got some spots left. Sign up at https://t.co/9j5MUdXFF7. https://t.co/rirDOFQQ1U
Nothing a Louisville fan has EVER said to me has ever bothered me but this one got to me a little bit. McGruff and Palmer were so mad that they came to my office to ask me about it. https://t.co/EE0BlqtKxD
I’m so proud of @AntDavis23. Only 25 years old and a finalist for the league’s best player. Incredible. I can remember when @drose won it at such a young age. You know what I love? Anthony was in town last week and HAS NOT CHANGED ONE BIT. https://t.co/3MjClyE4fh
I was so happy to see two of Rick Corman’s daughters yesterday, April and Shawna.
I want to thank Ed Quinn, president and CEO of R. J. Corman, once again for helping make it happen. Thank you to Brian Miller for all of his help with the logistics. And thank you to Jerry Lundergan for putting up tents in Midway and Lexington.
Woke up this morning blown away by the support we had from the #BBN. I’m sure folks will get upset when I say this, but tell me another school and fan base that could do that in the offseason. #BBN, you are crazy! https://t.co/0hMaYnvl11
I want to thank this group of officers for their help at Midway and Lexington. And of course, a huge thank you to everyone at R. J. Corman for making today happen. https://t.co/n5UeOdqKr1
You know what I love most? Most of the people who waited in line for 2-3 hours don’t get a chance to get in @Rupp_Arena. It’s those people and their passion that separates us from other fan bases. #BBN is the best.
What a day. The turnout for the #BigBlueCaravan was unbelievable. More than 500 people in Frankfort, Midway (maybe 1,000 there) and Lexington each. https://t.co/EttS4zYS7l
We just got done with our Satellite Camp in Frankfort in front of about 500 people when you include all the parents that stayed. (LOL!) We stopped at the capitol building afterwards to remind the guys who we’re playing for: the Commonwealth of Kentucky. #BigBlueCaravan https://t.co/PT9NO9pSQQ
I want to thank Ed Quinn, president and CEO of R. J. Corman, for making today’s #BigBlueCaravan happen. Happy to take a pic with his family: Olivia, Finley, Edward, Ed and Brandy. https://t.co/psv5m38s5F
We’re headed off for Frankfort for our Satellite Camp! Looking forward to seeing the #BBN on our way back. #BigBlueCaravan https://t.co/Tv6spzWSoe
Getting ready to hop aboard our #BigBlueCaravan ride for the day. Can’t thank R. J. Corman enough for making this happen. We will be back here to sign autographs and take pictures at this spot in Lexington at 7 p.m. We will be in Midway at 5:30 p.m. https://t.co/x9PrDtYMZr
Can’t wait to see the #BBN tomorrow! https://t.co/USelMOti3X
Congratulations to @HoopsWeiss!!! Well deserved. One of the best! https://t.co/NJEPzL0tTD
#BBN, we'll be going rain or shine! Hope to see you in Midway and Lexington tomorrow for autographs and pictures. https://t.co/L9t7N8ioLg
Want to wish @tjbeisner, our new editor of @CoachCalDotCom, a happy birthday. TJ has done an unbelievable job in the two months he's been with us already. Love his ideas and his approach to always be thinking about what's next.
Few moments as special for me then hugging each kid and their mom and dad. Happy for all of our guys. https://t.co/BpXjUQPOCA
We'll be out there to greet fans, sign autographs and take pictures at both spots. Complimentary posters will also be available to fans while supplies last. Hope to see everyone out there.
We'll be coming back on an R. J. Corman train and will make a stop in Midway (Darlin Jean's, 2014 N. Gratz St.) at approximately 5:30 p.m., and then in Lexington at the Central Kentucky Line outside of Rupp Arena (133 Buchanan St.) at approximately 7 p.m.
#BBN, I want to invite all of our fans to meet our team on Sunday as make a couple of pit-stops on the way back from our Satellite Camp in Frankfort!   https://t.co/OaLHcvybNV https://t.co/Q4i9mPYwSu
Dajuan Wagner, my first 20-point scorer and first player to go in the draft after one year and be a lottery pick! He and his son are attending our final #FatherSon Camp this weekend. https://t.co/qKmcCQ0UdJ
Could you imagine if we could keep kids for three years what this program would look like? Oh my gosh! But I’m always happy for the kids when they reach their dreams.
Now my work begins on next year’s team. With the added hours, I’m going to spend more time in the summer than I normally do trying to create something special. This team is as hungry as any team as I’ve coached, individually and collectively. They inspire me to want to do more.
I can look back at @Dreliggs34 and @DrewRoc5 and know that the draft doesn’t define your dreams. Everybody’s path is different.
I’m disappointed @WenyenGabriel's work to get on a team is not done yet, but I always tell every player that I coach when we go through this process, ‘It may not go perfectly, but if it’s your dream, you’ll make it.’ And I know our guys are made for this.
Graduation day is over. Last night was both exciting and disappointing, as it always is. I’m excited for the four players who got drafted. I’m excited for @KevKnox, @shaiglalex, @JVando and @hamidoudiallo because they are all in good places.
Congratulations, @hamidoudiallo!  I know you are going to give it everything you have! https://t.co/RamB2xpeL6
Happy for you, @JVando.  Can't wait for everyone to see what you're capable of doing. https://t.co/HleucQ0l3G
So happy for you and your family, @shaiglalex. https://t.co/7rvEqUJp6n
Congratulations @KevKnox!  Proud of you! https://t.co/wInjgrlzqY
Had a chance to see legendary and longtime Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett, and my good friend Brian Cashman. https://t.co/xUQUcntpyw
You know I had to stop by the @Yankees game before tonight’s #NBADraft. Former @UKBaseball pitcher James Paxton is pitching. Gotta be a good sign for tonight, right?! https://t.co/HVl4WfCZvo
Great time yesterday speaking to WinFieldUnited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Land O’ Lakes. Spent some time /their leadership team. Special group!

I always love rubbing up against the coach that won the national title. Hopefully it rubs off on us! Had a great time on @getupespn! What a studio! https://t.co/Xx4Ruthi1n
I lit five candles this morning at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Who do you think they were for? https://t.co/YaH6BeogsR
Our fans know when it comes to talent and experience, I’m always picking talent, but Reid gives us both. And what a great kid! #BBN, you are going to love him. Really looking forward to coaching him.
You’re talking about a two-time all-conference player who could have very well entered the NBA Draft with what he’s done in his career. He was one of the best big men in the Pac-12 last season, if not the country.
I felt good about where we stood with next year’s team, but when I found out how much @2ReidTravis2 wanted to be here, I had to take a look and say, OK, can he help us? Can he help our team become even more potent and can we help him reach his dreams? The answers were absolutely. https://t.co/zv8deNfN80
My good friend Pace Cooper came to campus and brought his friend Gaines Sturdivant. Had a great time reminiscing and showing them the facilities. Always good to see an old friend. https://t.co/vIyOZifHVo
If you all remember “Jersey Red” Ford from the 90s, this is Greg Ford, his son, and his family. Red’s grandson Ethan is in our camp this week. https://t.co/JKXvCYF38C
Really happy for @AntDavis23, a Hall of Fame player and person. Loved seeing him this weekend and can't wait to celebrate him in the fall. We've had a number of HOF-worthy guys over our last nine years. @JohnWall and @AntDavis23 are the first to get in but I know we'll have more. https://t.co/VnYf4lgzhr
Had a chance this morning be in every gym and watching stations, games and the college practice of the older guys at our overnight camp. Seeing all the smiling faces has reminded me why I do what I do. The best part of my day is being in the gym with a basketball and young people https://t.co/34MsREWfNI
Had a chance to meet Teresa, Brian and Maddox Cope while on the #BigBlueCaravan tour today at Marshall County HS. Their son and brother, Preston, was a victim of the shooting in January. #BBN, I’m asking all of us to continue to pray for everyone at Marshall County. https://t.co/bB5XyYnEl6
Having a blast with camp season both home and away. Our final two satellite camps will be June 24 in Franklin and Monticello on June 30. Let's finish the camp season strong. Sign up at https://t.co/9j5MUdXFF7. https://t.co/GqRBRdJeRc
I love how involved our players have been. Everyone, including @H23Ash, who just got to campus today, was really working.
Really good first day of Overnight Camp today. The Anthony Davis NBA group went through a college-like practice and played games. Really good stuff. Turning into an elite camp. The middle group really focused on moving without the ball. Can’t wait to see the young kids tomorrow. https://t.co/3YoeoWhIwK
He can do a little bit of everything, but what separates him from his peers is his playmaking ability and leadership. You’re talking about someone who other people want to play with. I’m looking forward to seeing him get to work with the rest of our guys.
Ashton wanted this so much that he worked extremely hard in the classroom these last few months to finish up his high school requirements and graduate this past week. Now he comes here just a couple of weeks after the rest of our guys and is ready to join this group.
.@H23Ash wanted to be at Kentucky all along. When I found out how badly he wanted this and had a chance to see him play, I told our staff what a great fit he would be whether he chose to come to school this season or next. https://t.co/7qnBq2ivXQ
The best thing Dad did for me and my sisters was take care of Mom when she got sick.  It was a 24-7 job.  Love you, Dad.  Happy Father's Day.
My own father worked 2-3 shifts to make our lives as comfortable as possible.  He was an absolute grinder and taught us the value of hard work.
Happy Father's Day to all of the fathers out there who have made their lives about their family!
Happy birthday to @IQ_GodSon! Getting his first batch of Mrs. Cal’s birthday brownies today. They’re on the way! https://t.co/vf4Q3buXsp

Darius Miller was a joy to coach and I'm so proud of what he's accomplished as a basketball player, but this gives you a glimpse of what an unbelievable person he is too. https://t.co/P6ZrbApwQK
Can’t wait to see the #BBN there! https://t.co/ziVjtNFflk
Had a great time with @AntDavis23 and his family and friends.  Anthony was and continues to be the ultimate team player.  Young players can learn a lot from his servant leadership on and off the court! https://t.co/8X2paFlLc3
Happy birthday to @UKDeWaynePeevy, who has been by my side since I got to Lexington. We've been through a lot together. He still doesn't know anything about basketball (LOL!) but he's been an unbelievable friend to me and one of the driving forces behind our program. https://t.co/sTFXA6mSUY
Two things always happen when I get with our players: One, they embellish, and two, they ask to see Mrs. Cal so they can get brownies. LOL
Had to take @AntDavis23 past Royce Pulliam’s new barbershop, @Floyds99, to show him this. Glad I got to spend time yesterday with Anthony, his friends and his family, including his newborn, Nala, and her mother, Marlen. https://t.co/mFWejciymZ
Look who is in town! @AntDavis23, Big Anthony, Garrett Partman, Sherman Mussatto, Marvell Scott and Ayden Scott swung by the office today. https://t.co/LdUjltimSN

Just got back from C.M. Newton's funeral. Unbelievably moving and touching to see all the friends, former players and colleagues from all walks of his life be there for his wife, Nancy, his children, Martin, Deborah and Tracy, and all of his family. So many people loved C.M.
I've really enjoyed our Father's Day series this week, but reading this from @TheErinCalipari today was a real joy.  I am very blessed.  Can't wait to see what @MeganteCalipari has in store! https://t.co/dhfSCOxfW2

It was great meeting @PadmaLakshmi and spending time with the @BravoTopChef crew today.  I finally learned there's more to food than just eating! https://t.co/uyUovPVwzD
I wanted to make sure we everyone got a chance to come to this camp. We've had such a positive response to it that we just had to add more. https://t.co/Zr4tgPmRCF
Looking back through some old photos and saw this today. Happened about a year ago at this time. Still just as proud today. @MarcusCamby23 had a long NBA career and came back to get his degree. My hope is all of our players reach their dreams and get their degree. https://t.co/93tapIkISM
Happy birthday, @jemarlbakerjr! Birthday brownies coming right up! https://t.co/bplr9pNU6Q
Julius Mays is a great young man and I am so proud of how committed he is to his family.  I hope the Father's Day stories this week remind BBN of just how special the people are who come through our program. https://t.co/tCtgai1f01

I’m not sure who is having more fun at our #FatherSon Camp, the kids or their dads. https://t.co/TUBlpk60UP

An hour or so ago, C.M. Newton passed away. Please keep him and his family in your prayers. During one of the most trying times of our athletic department, he came to the rescue and put us on the path we are today. May you rest in peace, my friend. https://t.co/InGk58yQzB

It's almost time for our camp season to kick off and I can't wait to see everyone at our camps.  If you haven't signed up yet, there are still a few spots available:  https://t.co/R9Hd5vOIJt https://t.co/0Hg4Eny28e
I'm excited for what PJ can do for himself and our team this year and I support Wenyen and Jarred as they pursue their dreams. https://t.co/Wle2nhEGHK
#BBN, I am asking that you please keep my dear friend C.M. Newton in your prayers.      https://t.co/ZwDgjbciQl
As I said before, we've only seen a small part of Jarred's game because of the adversity he faced this season, but he's got the motor and skill set that will serve him well at the next level.
On the other hand, he's seen how quickly this can be taken away. I completely understand and support his decision to get healthy and pursue his dreams now.
.@JVando had a difficult decision to make. I know he has been pulled in two different directions. On one hand he wants to show our fans what he can do in a full season and compete for a championship. I know he feels like he got that taken away from him this year. https://t.co/k57KPxDH7w
#BBN, let's show him our support. @JVando went through a lot this season and can't wait to see what he is going to do when he gets on the court for an extended period of time! https://t.co/dWaQXVLySr
This greeted me in my office on returning from the #SECSpringMeetings. A good man and a good woman. We miss you, Commissioner Slive! https://t.co/zlcyklKMlu
Wenyen grew so much from his freshman season to his sophomore year. If he continues to make those same strides, he’s going to carve himself a role with a team. He and I have talked and he knows he’s going to have to work hard to get there, but I’m confident he can.
.@WenyenGabriel's game is where the league continues to trend towards. He’s a position-less big man who can shoot, guard multiple positions and is willing to do what it takes to win. https://t.co/y90eUl1Sl6
Go do your thing! You've got our full support. https://t.co/sMcVqeRNIV
What I love most about this decision is why PJ is doing it. He told me he wants to come back to be a leader, to grow and to drag his teammates with him as we try to do something special.
I know how good of a player he is and think he showed it at times last season, but I’m looking forward to seeing him grow and build on it.
Whatever PJ decided we were going to support, but I’m really happy with the decision he’s come to because I really want to coach PJ for another season.
This is what the NBA Draft rules are in place for. @PJWashington was able to test the waters and get all the information that was available to him to make the best decision for him and his family. https://t.co/z02G8mvpUp
Happy for you, kid. Let's go chase something special. https://t.co/33D0gVIbLM

Another big game for @bradcalipari overseas. Went for 17 points and six assists in his final game today! Looking forward to hearing all about it when he gets back.
Another big game for @bradcalipari! He scored 14 points, had eight assists and was 4 of 5 from 3. Proud of him.
True servant leaders care more for their brothers, their teammates and their units more than themselves. Today, on #MemorialDay, let’s all reflect and give thanks to all those who put their lives on the line for all of us.
I saw an older veteran being interviewed today about the fear of going into battle and his comment struck me. He said, “Yeah, we were fearful of our lives, but we were more fearful we would do something stupid and cost one of our brothers’ lives.” That’s servant leadership.
As I’m watching war movies today, from Patton to Casualties of War and others, I’m reminded of how blessed we are to live in the land of opportunity &amp; freedom. My family, which immigrated to this country, owes so much to those that fought &amp; died for the opportunities we now have.
.@bradcalipari is overseas this week playing on a basketball tour with Global Sports Academy. He had 17 points and 11 assists and was 3 for 7 from 3 in their last game, a win.
Every player is on their own path. When you think about what Isaiah accomplished in two years here and Dom accomplished in four, I can’t wait to see where their career takes them.
Couldn’t be more proud of @AntDavis23 being the third-leading vote-getter behind @KingJames and @JHarden13. He just continues to get better and amazes all of us right before our eyes. And young @KarlTowns made his first All-NBA Team with many, many more to come. Proud of both! https://t.co/URSlGECGLu
Happy to see @ZayBriscoe and @Dhawk_25 enjoying success overseas. I know those two will grind to make their dreams come true. https://t.co/rIh9OzrvtT
I think our fans are really going to enjoy these upgrades. @Rupp_Arena has long been the gold standard in college basketball and this is another step in making sure it stays that way. I may even make my way to the upper level and try out the new chair-backs. LOL. https://t.co/gV9NPvILEh
How about @TwanyBeckham11? Happy for him! https://t.co/BKmTfP88a5
One of the most gratifying times of my coaching career has been watching Brad grow and develop to the man he is today, and I'm so happy Kenny and Zan get that experience now. It will be fun to watch.
Like his dad, he's got a fighter's mentality and there is no doubt in my mind he's going to scratch and claw his way to a role on this team once he get his knee healthy.
We've always been an option for him, but we wanted Zan to make this decision on his own. I'm so happy he's decided to stay at home with us because he's an underrated talent who is going to bring a lot of depth to our team.
Every conversation Kenny and I have had about @young_payne2321 has been about what's best for Zan. I wanted Kenny to take the same approach with Zan that I had with @bradcalipari. Let the kid do what's best for him and be there to support them. https://t.co/A5zBCVPqNi
#BBN, we've added a stop to our Satellite Camp tour, which begins in just a couple weeks. We'll be headed to Boyle County High School on June 14.   You can sign up for one of our six Satellite Camp stops at https://t.co/h5g3wD5FtH. https://t.co/TDCRaUAGo9

By the way, no golf for me. Still recuperating. Back to resting for 10 days after this trip.

I’m happy @taiwynyard decided on Santa Clara. Coach Herb Sendek is a friend from Pittsburgh. He was an assistant at Kentucky in the 90s. I’m looking forward to watching and rooting for them!
Sad to hear that Bret Bearup passed away suddenly. A former Kentucky player for Coach Hall, I’ve known Bret since my days at UMass. He was always a loyal and good-hearted person who loved the game of basketball. He’s going to be missed. Prayers for him and his family.
Good luck to @UKCoachLawson and the @UKsoftball team tomorrow. Incredible job that Coach Lawson does every year. They're always in the hunt! #BBN, let's show them support this weekend. https://t.co/xKzK8GjILO
Utah gives us a great opponent for our fans at home next season, &amp; then in 2019, our fans can spend a week with us at one of our favorite stops over the last few years. I still get people who come up to me and tell me about how much fun they had in 16 when we played UNC in Vegas.
I promised you some schedule news. One of the things I hear most about from our fans is they enjoy traveling w/us &amp; staying at a destination location for multiple games. That was our goal in scheduling this game with @UtahMBB in Vegans in addition to our game with @OhioStateHoops https://t.co/NpAZ8cmz8v
Wow! Congrats to Coach Craig and the guys. Looks like I know who to call to help me with my game. https://t.co/kYecgQ1Gkv
I am devastated tonight over the passing of my friend and mentor, Mike Slive.  I knew Mike was not feeling great and, earlier this week, I wrote about his impact on my life.  I shared this with Mike earlier today and wanted to share it with you, as well.  https://t.co/yqiKZLjUQe https://t.co/x6QhXVhS40
If they decide to pursue their genius and play professional basketball, they know they have lifetime scholarships so they can come back and finish their degree. Whether they leave early or stay here, they're in good academic standing and on schedule to graduate.
Our kids are committed to learning and take care of business in the classroom. We teach growth in all areas. It's well documented what our players learn about giving back that they carry with them for the rest of their lives.
For some kids that's playing professionally. For others it's outside of basketball. Whatever they decide to do – whatever their 'genius' is in – it's our job to make sure they're prepared when they leave here. W/18 who have graduated over nine years, I believe we've done that.
Proud of this and happy for our guys, @UKMichaelStone and our CATS staff. Our whole mindset is preparing our kids for the rest of their lives. It's about taking that next step to what they are going to do once they leave Kentucky. https://t.co/LokFH4gzqL
The first time I heard it I thought I heard five star. The second time I listened to it, it without question says Laurel. https://t.co/RCyWmQxm2M
A great kid headed to play for a great coach, a great program and a great school. I wish @SKJ all the best. https://t.co/lNsWgfUZlx
What I love about him is he models his game after @AntDavis23, one of the best we’ve ever had, but wants to be his own player and carve out his legacy.
EJ is the type of position-less player the game is moving towards. He can play just about anywhere and make plays on the perimeter with his skills and versatility, yet he’s got the length and the ability to finish in the post as well as anyone in this class.
I hope our fans understand just how good @E_Montomery is and how excited we are to have him. You’re talking about a skilled big man who can affect the game in a number of ways. https://t.co/ALQ9pUe0A7
Been out it recovering but just got caught up on a great weekend. Heard @GoSydGo &amp; @JCamachoQuinn got gold at SECs, Sydney set an NCAA record, &amp; our @KentuckyTrack 4x400 relay won gold. Plus @UKsoftball is hosting NCAAs &amp; @UKBaseball may have given #TheCliff one more weekend. Wow
I want to congratulate @JustMarcusLee on graduating this weekend. Even though Marcus didn’t finish with us, I’m just as proud of what he’s been able to do with getting a college degree. https://t.co/auWNlZujwp
I am also thinking of all of you who are spending today without your mothers.  My mom, Donna, passed away on November 28, 2010 and I think of her daily.  We cannot tell our mothers "thank you" enough.
I want to wish #BBN a happy Mother's Day - especially my wife, Ellen.  She's done an amazing job raising our three kids and loves all of the players we welcome into our family.  She is big part of why our players feel at home in Lexington.
Happy birthday to @Q_Green1. Birthday brownies will be waiting for you when you get back in June. https://t.co/rekVHVAugV

Guido Rotella, Bob Rotella’s father, turns 99 today. Wow!!! As you all know, Bob has been a great mentor for me and someone who I bounce ideas off of every season.
Here's our list of stops. Hope to see the #BBN out in full force.   🔵 June 4 - Bardstown 🔵 June 4 - Elizabethtown 🔵 June 5 - London 🔵 June 6 - Louisville 🔵 June 7 - Union
After hearing from so many of you, we've decided to bring the Satellite Camps back. From June 4-7, we'll be making five stops throughout the state. We've already got one that's nearly sold out and the others are quickly filling up.   ➡️ https://t.co/Jf6sXY4nvO https://t.co/k0n4UFQG8g
Happy birthday to @timasher. We ask Tim and his crew to turn around a lot of video during the season and they're always on top of it. https://t.co/w3EpO2lHQb
TJ has some big ideas for us that will take some time, but looking forward to showing them soon.  You can read about what TJ is going to bring to the table at https://t.co/0fMXnPTJOY.
As our fans know, I like to use my website and social media to give the #BBN a transparent look into our program. TJ’s ideas for content for the site align with what I hope to deliver to our fans every day.
Excited to announce we've found our new editor for my website in @tjbeisner. TJ comes to us highly regarded for his work ethic, his out-of-the-box thinking, and his past relationships with our student-athletes and staff.
Happy birthday to my good friend Luther Deaton! Hope you're having a great day, Luther!
Hey #BBN, we’re working on playing two regular-season games against Power Five teams at a destination spot for our fans in 2019-20. Hope to have details soon.

I really haven’t had time to look at the commission’s recommendations yet. I had a minor surgery yesterday that’s going to keep me in the hospital for a couple days. I’m probably going to miss recruiting this weekend, but all is good!
The great thing about this time around is the games will be on site, making this even easier than the last trip. I can't wait to get down there. Head to https://t.co/iAWn1Xmcu5 to book your hotel and get tickets. Hope to see the #BBN in full force! #BigBlueBahamas
I still have some of our fans come up to me and tell me about how much fun they had in 2014 when we went to the Bahamas. This is a chance to see our team in an unbelievable setting, get up close with our kids and stay at the best vacation resort I've ever been to. https://t.co/YZzVX9HoZS

He has the type of skills and talent that NBA teams love; now we have to figure out if now is the time or if he needs another season. Either way, Jarred's best days are ahead of him and I can't wait to see him back on the court.
We would certainly welcome Jarred back with open arms and I would love the opportunity to coach him for a full season, but I know he needs to go through this process and see where he's at.
What we did see was a player with an unbelievable motor who will grab every ball, get his teammates involved and fight like heck.
.@JVando is in a unique situation because of the time he missed on the court this season. I truly believe we only saw a small part of Jarred's game because he had to figure out how to play with us and we had to figure out how to play with him. https://t.co/s5ZVNdAmWH

If he needs to return to school, we will continue to push him to be the best version of himself as we try to chase a championship next season. It's a win-win for him, and he has my full support.
If it's his time and he can continue on the path that he went on this year, he becomes a valuable asset for a team because of his energy, his willingness to do anything to win and his ability to stretch the floor.
.@WenyenGabriel knows how much I would like to coach him another year, but I also understand the situation he’s in and his desire to pursue his dreams. The great part about this process is Wenyen will know firsthand where he stands with the NBA. https://t.co/XLDBOfuVc1

I wish I had the opportunity to coach him another year but I understand and support his decision.
I am so proud of his growth from beginning to end. He’s prepared to succeed and will succeed. He’s the best athlete in the draft who’s continued to improve his shooting. He’s only touched his true talent.
Hami got better in all areas of his game. True growth happens when you get knocked down to the point of questioning yourself. We already knew how talented of a player Hami was physically &amp; athletically, but we all learned about Hami’s toughness, his character &amp; his desire to win.
Last year he wanted to come back to put on that Kentucky jersey in a game for the first time, compete for a championship and improve his game. He did all three this season.
I remember going through this process with @hamidoudiallo last year. In both cases, our conversations were about what was best for Hami. https://t.co/LiGUZqo3kn

I'm just as happy for Dillon as I am for our other guys who go on to pursue their genius in other areas, whether it be in the NBA or in the business world. My guess is Dillon will be in the middle of a program to put people on Mars before it's all said and done. Proud of him.
I've been stopped by professors who ask me, 'Do you know how smart he is?' Being from Pittsburgh, I know what it means to be accepted into Carnegie Mellon. I also know my application wouldn't have even made it to anyone's desk.
.@dillonpulliam30 was a great teammate and an important part of what we do in practice every day. He earned a partial scholarship at different points because of his contributions. Suffice it to say, he was a great student. https://t.co/DPv1CFWsEl

He’s done this because he’s put in the work, and it’s that attitude and mindset that will ensure his success at the next level. I couldn’t be more proud of him and I know that whatever team gets him is going to get a young man that will bring a winning mentality.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I’ve never met a kid who is undisciplined off the court be disciplined on it. Shai’s entire life is disciplined, and it’s not forced by others around him.
@shaiglalex You’re talking about a kid who had the physical tools and had the potential to be in this position, but he elevated his game because he woke up at 7 a.m. every day to work out, was the best in the weight room, watched film and never missed class.
.@shaiglalex’s development is a story I’ll tell our players for the rest of my career. When we talk about building your own confidence and conquering yourself, Shai is the perfect example. https://t.co/OJECZyNkf4
With that said, when a kid comes to me &amp; believes what’s best for him is somewhere else, they always have my full support. We want what’s best for these kids and will always do whatever we can to make sure they can pursue their dreams. Our staff wishes Sacha nothing but the best.
I truly believe Sacha was just starting to find out who he is and that his best days are ahead of him. I still believe that whether he’s here or someone else.
It’s never easy for me seeing a player go, especially when it’s someone you’ve seen grow as much as @SKJ has and someone you want to continue to coach. https://t.co/d8Ii0TNK0N
Congratulations to @UKCoachGarrison and the @UKGymnastics team! Doing things that have never been done before. Keep it going! https://t.co/0xJF9E1IJy
.@CoachTonyBarbee, Coach David, Doug Brown and Don Deweese at Gibson’s Donuts in Memphis. Last night saw @DrewRoc5 and @THEwillieCS15 after the game and had dinner with @swipathefox and @OneBigHaitian. Love seeing family! #LaFamilia https://t.co/qGe6u67FPs
If you ask me, we should have had one more or two more guys invited as well. Hopefully still happens! Congrats to @DevinBook, @boogiecousins, @AntDavis23 and @JohnWall. My boys are all grown up! https://t.co/vvNYAGousr
Congratulations to @KeldonJohnson10! Looking forward to seeing Keldon and @raf_tyler in the @JordanClassic this weekend. Keldon and @IQ_GodSon made some winning plays at last week’s @McDAAG. https://t.co/uKlJKHtU2q
Great, now @KarlTowns is going to tell me I held him back. https://t.co/N2KGd3768Y
All of that will bode well as he moves on to the pro ranks. His scoring ability and his 6-9 frame make him a positionless player that the entire league is looking for. I can’t wait to see what the next step is for him.
Kevin is one of the greatest kids I’ve coached. He was a great teammate, a great student and a great player. He is mature and responsible well beyond his years.
His defense and rebounding improved throughout the year, which is a big reason why we were able to go on a run at the end of the season.
He improved in every area of his game, became an efficient scorer like some of the best players I’ve coached here and could score all types of ways, including runners, pull-ups, 3-pointers, post-ups and in pick-and-roll offense.
.@KevKnox came in as one of the youngest freshmen in the country and adapted as well as any player I have ever coached. https://t.co/0QzD80GZaf
Like all these kids, I would like to continue to coach PJ, but I’m going to support him as he goes through this process.
PJ has improved physically and mentally. His ability to play winning basketball isn’t even close to where it was at the beginning of the season. I’ve seen a tremendous growth in all those areas.
.@PJWashington and I met and talked this week about his future and the process that he would be able to go through if he chose to. I think it’s very important that each kid understands where he stands at this point in the eyes of professionals. https://t.co/OjQyHdDYz1
Happy birthday to @JVando! Been through a lot this season but love Jarred’s attitude and fight through it all. Birthday brownies are on their way. https://t.co/54hiqAUjpA
We are sad to see him go, but he has our full support and we will do whatever we can to make sure he can continue to pursue his dreams. That’s what this is all about here at Kentucky.
To come to a new country in the middle of the season and try to carve out a role was difficult, but I’m proud of Tai for the person he’s grown into. I know this decision wasn’t easy for him because he is just now starting to learn who he is and how he can contribute to a team.
We haven’t had a lot of players transfer, but when a player comes to me and asks for a fresh start, I will always support them. We talk all the time about this being a new experience for our players, but I believe it was even tougher for Tai because of where he came from. https://t.co/ik0MJQOdrX
Hall of Famer Lefty Driesell and his wife, Joyce. Lefty has been elected to the @Hoophall. So deserving!! By the way, he had on his Kentucky Invitational Tourney watch on! I had to ask him if he won and he said no one ever won other than Kentucky. https://t.co/22qNdZgnCj
Wow! When do I get to see @GoSydGo run in person? She’s in the right hands with @TrackKentucky. #FloKnows
To see the joy our guys had at the end of the season, the respect they had for one another and the exhilaration they experienced when they saw the growth from all their hard work — like I’ve said, this was one of the most rewarding seasons of my career.  https://t.co/jO1y9cfv5W
Even though I don’t coach football, this captured my feelings at the end of a season that came too soon but was very rewarding. This was sent to me by my good friend Jason Shrinsky. https://t.co/e2FoTuZaMf
Don was a builder of hope and he and his wife, Mira, who served on the UK board of trustees, gave so much of their time to helping others. My prayers go out to the Ball family.
Thinking and praying for the Ball family today. Don Ball passed away last week. Don and his family have done so much for our city and our state, including this university.
Happy birthday @WenyenGabriel! I know Mrs. Cal is at home baking your birthday brownies today. https://t.co/dbrwimRs1X
Very happy for @1CMatthews for being named the West Region’s most outstanding player and making the Final Four. A terrific player and a great young man.
As a coach and as a fan, all you can ask is that they give their very best and that they do it as a team. This team tried to do that all year. Losing stinks, but I’m proud of each and every one of them.
It’s hard for us to see the forest through the trees right now, but each of these kids gave everything they had, including in a game last night when we weren’t playing at our best. And we still had a chance to win!
What they accomplished this year can never be taken away. To play like they played all year – coming together, battling through adversity, continuing to work every day and representing all of us the way they did – is truly amazing.
I woke up this morning feeling as sick as I did last night after that game. This is going to hurt for a while for all of us. The players took it as hard as any team I’ve had when it ends.
We’re in #Catlanta on @DmillerKY’s birthday. Darius loved playing in this city. Won the SEC Tournament MVP here in 2011 and had some big games during our 2012 stop here on the way to the championship. Happy birthday, Darius!
#BBN, please join me in wishing @UKMR_Deb in our sports information department a happy birthday today. Happy birthday, Deb!
Nebraska Wesleyan won the DIII championship this past weekend. Head coach Dale Wellman was Kentucky born and raised! Congratulations to Dale and his team!
Forget the seeds. Everybody is 0-0 that’s moving forward and it's not about seeding; it's about who is playing the best. We are in a tough region. I'm looking forward to seeing @JVando today to see how far he's come along.
So happy for @hamidoudiallo. This is what it's all about. https://t.co/iRT9QpMCHV
#BBN, let’s bring the WHOLE band to #Catlanta! Let’s paint the city blue like we’ve always done. https://t.co/ZDcSQlww93
Had to go back to DK's after mass. Wanted to confirm that the donuts are that good. Confirmed!! I was wrong about their hours. They’re open 4 a.m. to 9 p.m. With Angkearot Long. https://t.co/Twwcwdefpp
#BBN, it’s @pdpatt’s birthday! Please join me in wishing him a happy one.
A major shoutout to Charlie Brock and his Springfield college basketball team for going to the DIII Final Four for the first time in school history!! Our game was invented by James Naismith 126 years ago on that campus. Great job!!!
Just found a donut shop in Boise that compares to Gibson’s! DK’s on 13th and State Street. It's more about coffee with Ellen and me BUT these donuts are crazy!
Our national championship coach Harry Mullins! Loves his kids and loves to coach. The pic of him doing the confetti angel was hysterical. https://t.co/iICLTpzr51
Had to get my driver’s license renewed in between tapes. Took five mins and the ladies at Keithshire Way were terrific. Check the expiration on your license!!!
I’ve figured it out, #BBN. This foot of snow was all to discourage you from going to Boise, a great city and a great basketball town. Don’t let it. Let’s pack that town and paint it blue.
I realize that the selection committee is very intentional, but how did they get a foot of snow to blanket Lexington? They are good. LOL!
Watching MIRACLE. Bunch of young kids come together to do the impossible. Seeing a young team come together through adversity and feel joy for each other is priceless!!
It’s the kid with the one eyebrow’s birthday today. Happy birthday, @AntDavis23!
Wow, just catching up to the big day in @UKAthletics because we’ve been preparing for tomorrow. A team and individual national championship for @ukrifle and Henrik Larsen, Tim Duckworth from @KentuckyTrack wins a national title and a big day for @UKBaseball! Unbelievable!
Excited to be a part of the SGFam! Go check out @stringguardsusa. A portion of all proceeds will go towards supporting a special project with The Calipari Foundation. #stringguards #sgfam21 #BBN https://t.co/id8BifrwDu

Shoutout to @LIUBasketball and @CoachKellogg. Big-time win on the road to get in the NCAA Tournament. It’s that time of the year! Gotta love it!
Happy for @KevKnox and @shaiglalex. They've gotten so much better as the season has gone on. To do what they've done with the youngest team in the country, I'm proud of them. I think you'll see more of our guys get honored as we get into the postseason. https://t.co/0eG2YHkEKS
The girls set up a great hospitality room at the game. https://t.co/cZvdVeIK3C
Earlier today I asked for prayers for my dear friend Dr. @PearseLyons. I want to tell you a little bit more about him and all that he's done for people and this state.  https://t.co/xGXZB1MOrR https://t.co/9COhhs0OIK
@PearseLyons He's a battler but it's going to take more. If it's in God's will, don't be afraid to pray for miracles. What he's done in this town and this state and what he's done for people has been unbelievable. Let's do our part and pray for him now.
Asking for all the prayers we can get for Dr. @PearseLyons. He needs all of us. Visited him this morning at UK Hospital w/his wife, Deidre, &amp; son, Mark. He's had complications from open heart surgery. You're talking about a man who has the biggest heart of anyone I've ever met.
Prayers answered!! Tyris is out of the hospital! Thanks, #BBN!
The long kid with one eyebrow wins Western Conference Player of the Month! Congrats, @AntDavis23! https://t.co/X6v5reF1MQ
#BBN, join me in praying for Tyris Hamilton of Alabama. I took communion for him at mass this morning. Tough news yesterday but he's in good hands!
I hope our guys are starting to get the respect they deserve. We've got a bunch of great kids who have put in an unbelievable amount of work this season. Proud of not just these two, but all of our guys. https://t.co/bNVzys9k8u
@DevinBook @KarlTowns @J30_RANDLE @AntDavis23 .@THEwillieCS15, @OneBigHaitian, @swipathefox, @pdpatt, @Enes_Kanter and @DrewRoc5 also scored in double figures, plus @AaronICE2 led @usabasketball in scoring. GREAT NIGHT GUYS!
Four of ours had double-doubles last night. @DevinBook had 40-10. @KarlTowns 26-17. @J30_RANDLE 19-10. And @AntDavis23 53-18, which makes him only second player in history to get at least 50-15. https://t.co/ZQ36Na1usz
.@IsaacHumphries7 wins NBL Rookie of the Year in the Australian professional league! Couldn't be more happy. He worked hard while he was here and really helped our program. Congrats, Isaac! https://t.co/UcDU4ahvfo
Had to get a quick bite before my radio show at OBC Kitchen. You've got to try the shrimp and grits and the brisket tacos. The best I've ever had. If you're into bourbon it's heaven. And even if you're not, the food is so good you have to try it.

Quan Claitt, a family friend, was named OVC Male Field Athlete of the Week. He was the Co-Indoor Field Athlete of the Year (first from EKU ever). Now he just won gold at the indoor meet in Illinois with a jump of 7-3. That makes him 11th in the country. Congrats!
A day late but wanted to wish @BeMore27 a happy birthday! I know wherever Jamal is, he's probably smiling. That's what he does!

@boogiecousins @JohnWall @AntDavis23 @KarlTowns Happy for all of our guys playing at NBA All-Star weekend - @DevinBook, @BeMore27, @swipathefox,@TerrenceJones1 and @AaronICE2. #LaFamilia
I’m so happy for both these families and proud of their sons. Wish @boogiecousins and @JohnWall could play tomorrow with @AntDavis23 and @KarlTowns. https://t.co/s0jGtBJH1S
Watching @DevinBook make that many shots reminds me of the run he had here. As good of a shooter as I’ve ever coached. Congrats, Devin! https://t.co/SpQtJubsrA
Our good luck charm today. We needed that one and @Bam1of1’s mom helped us!!! https://t.co/YZVEjAJ8M3
The great thing is the crew can do that while being of no distraction to our team and our goals. They're around, but they're a fly on the wall. We get to open the doors to our team in a way we've never done before while I coach my team and these kids learn. https://t.co/NXbO8cFOqm
We get approached all the time to do all-access shows. The one question I always have is, what is our why? Why are we doing this? What I liked about this it's about showing the type of kids we have here and the family atmosphere we've created. https://t.co/vc0nmIQegD

Happy birthday to @AhmadMonk! I remember this time last year he really started to elevate his game. Hope you have a great day, Malik!
To our students, let's pack the place. We need your help. Student tickets are still available by going to the UK ticket office starting at 9 a.m. on Monday.
We need you Tuesday to be at your best from the tip to the finish. If we’re going good, ride it and push us to make the lead unbearable. If we’re struggling some, encourage us and bring us back. The last eight minutes of the game, do not sit down! We need you more than ever now!
These are good kids who are just understanding how bad they need each other. They’re just so young, but we’re going to get this.
#BBN, I’m trying to do everything in my power to help this young team come together. I'll be honest, after being in the office last night and again this morning watching tape, we played well enough defensively to win that game forcing 20 turnovers.
All with one eyebrow. Congratulations, @AntDavis23! https://t.co/y8vVcBPS3o

.@CoachHuggs continues to use his position to make a difference. He drew 2,000 to a fish fry to raise money for a fund named after his mother, Norma Mae, the night before our game. He told me I was helping. He never asks LOL. Good job, my friend. Enjoyed being a part of it. https://t.co/ra9GXEmilj

Still can’t get over the high school shooting in Marshall Co. that led to the deaths of two 15-year-olds &amp; also ruined the life of the shooter, another 15-year-old. As I said last night, something has to change. I prayed at mass this morning &amp; lit a candle for everyone involved.
Wow! Four guys in the @NBAAllStar Game! Not half yet but we’re on our way there. I hear it’s tied for the most ever. Congratulations to @KarlTowns, @JohnWall, @AntDavis23 and @boogiecousins.
.@MarcusCamby23 was honored today at the @UMassBasketball game. Wish Ellen and I could have been there. He took a good program to No. 1 and was a great teammate to all. Proud that he graduated too!!!

Did I hear it’s @raf_tyler’s birthday today? Happy birthday, Tyler! Just wait until this time next year — you’ll get some of Mrs. Cal’s birthday brownies.
@boogiecousins @AntDavis23 I wish we had more as starters and hope to see several more of our guys added as reserves. I’m not giving up on my wish to have half the players in the game one year.

Jo Jo had a competitive fierceness and toughness to him that was second to none. He was still competing and playing competitively into his 40s. I will be praying for Jo Jo and his wife, Deborah.
Jo Jo White of @KUHoops and @celtics fame passed away yesterday. I became friends with Jo Jo while we were on staff at Kansas under Ted Owens back in the 80s. I was blessed to both call him a friend and to go into the @Hoophall with him together in 2015.
Congratulations to Keldon Johnson and @IQ_GodSon on making the @McDAAG! They join a long list of talented guys we’ve had play in that game. Disappointed @raf_tyler wasn’t selected. He’s certainly deserving, especially with the last year he’s had. I know he will use this as fuel! https://t.co/5d1fqXwJNR

“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” - MLK
I’m happy our player realize he was a servant leader. Martin Luther King Jr. lived his life for others despite always having danger and death looking over his shoulder. He never wavered that justice and truth should reign supreme.
They realize MLK pushed our country in a way it needed to go and he did it in a nonviolent way, to help create legislation for civil rights and voting rights for all Americans of any race. He changed our country and its direction forever.
The players realized how intelligent MLK was when they found out he skipped both the 9th and 11th grades to enroll early in college. When they learned he enrolled at Morehouse College at age 15 they said, “What?”
He opposed the Vietnam War not only morally, but also because he thought poor kids and minorities were the ones fighting it.
Then we proceeded to talk about his life and many accomplishments - all in the name of justice and fairness. We talked about his courage with all the death threats, along with opposing a war, which at the time was popular.
I put on the board today a quote from MLK’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech: “I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”

He had traveled with our team with his wife, Sandy. We had spoken, but I regret not spending more time in conversation before he passed away. Such a good man taken way too early.
I just left the visitation for Brad Bell. The sad thing is, all of us seem to learn more about people after they pass. I didn’t know Brad was in the service, didn’t know he loved to drive Harleys and didn’t know he was a marketing executive for IBM.

You only know if you’re going to win or lose when you win or lose, so why create any anxiety and look ahead? If you start thinking, 'What if this happens, what if that happens,' catch yourself and stop. Stay in the moment. Enjoy today.
Just finished our walkthrough this morning. Let’s show the world that we are the classiest fans in the country. Be Loud, Be Proud and Wear Blue.
Couldn’t be more proud of @AlexTheGreat22 and his competitive spirit and fight. He’s fought his way into the league just like @DakariJohnson, @DrewRoc5 and others. That’s what I love about the G-League. It gives players that opportunity to find themselves — or prove themselves. https://t.co/ccYKyUQxaj
We will return after Christmas and get back to work. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
#BBN, Ellen and I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas. We hope your next couple of days are spent with family and friends. I think it’s always important for our guys to be with loved ones during this time of the year so our players and staff are home for the holidays.
Being a WWII buff, I thought it was important to take the guys to the National WWII Museum after practice. We spent an hour there. I could have stayed six. I talked to them about the Tuskegee Airmen, who they did know. I think they enjoyed it. https://t.co/Or7sQzz4kk
Lit candles today for Dick Enberg and some close friends at Saint Louis Cathedral. https://t.co/zcO4ulTvVZ
So saddened to hear we lost Dick Enberg. I just did a podcast with him two months ago. We were supposed to talk for 30 minutes but ended up talking an hour because we were having so much fun. He was as sharp as ever. That voice of his: legendary. Praying for him and his family.
Our team doctor at UMass, Dr. James Ralph, passed away today. He and his wife, Edie, were a part of our family.  He looked after our family and team. Ellen and I are saddened by the news. He and his family will be in our daily prayers.
New digs for the kids are coming together! https://t.co/qmPcohyUmH
Thrilled as a coach that our players understand what it means to give back. https://t.co/RspO5xtMBo
I want to thank Jerry and Vanessa Haffey, @Kroger, @LundysCatering, Tempur Sealy, @SleepOutfitters, @FanOutfitters, and Oneness for all of their support in making tonight happen. Servant leadership from some great companies in our city.
And to see the looks on the faces of some of those families – it’s what this time of the year is all about.
What was special to me was to be able to see our guys bring joy to some families’ lives. What a great lesson and opportunity for them to see what they can do for others with their position they’re in.
Special night tonight. We were able to give Christmas gifts to 10 local families The guys really enjoyed singing Christmas carols, handing out gifts and serving food. https://t.co/PRZlvDOlmc
Who’s that behind the sunglasses? https://t.co/nKjmdiHV2h
#BBN, please join me in wishing @HarrisRob3 a happy birthday today. Rob has been unbelievable with our guys. They absolutely love him!
WHEN SUCCESS TURNS YOUR HEAD, YOU FACE FAILURE! - Coach Wooden  We are getting ready to play a good, well-coached UCLA team in New Orleans and was thinking about the one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time.
Happy birthday, @swipathefox! https://t.co/oDAIGqWZgH
Proud of @UKCoachStoops and @UKFootball for the type of kids they have and are bringing to the @universityofky
I see a lot of basketball talent in this class 🤔 #BlueGrassBound18
Three times today + dinner. Is that four-a-days? Tomorrow will be only three-a-days. It’s our time to get better, both individually and collectively.
My good friend Geno Auriemma is going for 1,000th win. He’s as good as it gets at any level.
In honor of Quade and how well he played with the sunglasses on Saturday, we’ve decided we’re going to practice the same way. We’re going to petition the NCAA to protect our eyes! https://t.co/BEcsWXnc6j
He was one of the kindest, most honorable men I’ve ever met. He remained a mentor throughout my career, and he and his brother came to Lexington a few times for practice. He will be in my thoughts and prayers.
One of the best basketball coaches I’ve come in contact with passed away last week. I just found out about it. Ron Galbreath coached at Westminster College in Western PA for nearly 30 years.
Holiday dinner with managers and staff. They clean up nice! Austin, Kevin, Vince, Randy, Robert, Barrett, Brady, Andrew, Hank, Jessie, Mike, Trey, Brian and Johnny. https://t.co/9yQQhQNDvz
Congratulations to Gerald Fitch and @danielserik! Our guys are ALWAYS welcome back. https://t.co/0uyGkpErDO
A miracle and a blessing. Congratulations, Kevin! So proud of you! https://t.co/RzRu66uG2C
.@KarlTowns had 30 points, 14 rebounds, five assists and five blocks in a win last night. First player for the T’wolves to do that since KG in ‘03! #NBACats
The only thing I can say I helped with was encouraging Kevin when I saw him. John was there like a family member. Could anything be more rewarding? Great job, Robes.
I try to surround myself with people who have caring hearts and are about others. John Robic’s role in helping Kevin Massey can’t be understated.
Kevin has been an unbelievable inspiration to us all. John Robic has become like a father to him. It’s been a joy to watch that relationship, to watch Kevin grow and to see him graduate this weekend. Proud of you, Kevin! https://t.co/3xi5HLlWHQ
Andrew Harrison started and scored a season-high 16 points Monday for the Grizzlies. Aaron Harrison had 32 last night for Reno and is averaging 20.1 points! He’s going to have his opportunity!
Career-high 25 points, five rebounds and five 3-pointers for @TreyLyles last night! Just needed an opportunity and now he’s taking advantage. #NBACats
Thanks to @DavidYurman for this timeless piece. #DavidYurmanMen #CitiHoopsClassic https://t.co/FvFdyM7GYG
At Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. Had the honor to hear Cardinal Dolan. His message: IN GOD’S DUE TIME. Something I needed to hear! https://t.co/5TtcooEb1Q
It was @EBled2’s birthday yesterday! So happy for Eric and what’s he’s doing in Milwaukee. Happy birthday, Eric!
Great seeing Max Kellogg, Jackson Connors and Logan Duwors. Three future Wildcats? https://t.co/lDSUAMCXEH

Had a great practice at Baruch College. Want to thank John Alesi for letting us use their gym. Afterwards I stopped by @TheNBPA &amp; met w/two friends, Michele Roberts, the executive director of the NBAPA, and Chrysa Chin, the executive VP of strategy and development. Great people! https://t.co/qzEfg1KYLQ
Who is that guarding Steph?? https://t.co/oPCfPSAXDV
I’ve done two podcasts, one with Jim Harbaugh and here’s the latest with Geno Auriemma, both guests on my podcast a year ago. Man, I kinda miss doing them. Maybe I should start doing them again. https://t.co/HKl2UxMBaZ
His company is trying to change the storyline of athletes after their playing days are over by aiding and encouraging athletes to plan for the future. I hope you’ll check out DCTG Media Agency.
Life takes many turns and self-evaluation and self-discovery are among the most important turns you can make. As Supreme, as CDR goes by now, is on this journey, he’s trying to help others, which in my mind is admirable.
Chris Douglas-Roberts, one of my former players at Memphis who played professionally for several years, is now on another journey. He’s changed his name, has a great family and now is the CEO of a new company, DCTG Media Agency!
Happy birthday to @Goodknight11! Just 26 years old! Amazing. He's going to come back stronger than ever. Looking forward to seeing him back on the court.
.@EBled2 plays big in win for Bucks!  25 pts and 4 asst. Love it! #NBACats
.@UKDeWaynePeevy and I took the birthday girls out for dinner tonight. Yep, not only was it Ellen’s birthday today, it was also @allisonpeevy1’s! I put DeWayne in charge of making sure we don’t forget every year. LOL. Happy birthday  to our better halves! https://t.co/CK1flKPIYx
It’s Coach Hall’s birthday today!!! I’m so happy that he came to our practice on his birthday. He looked great!!
Let’s get behind them, #BBN. @UKCoachSkinner has his team playing at such a high level. Pack Memorial! https://t.co/GTNMH3WLIj
.@kwiltj sent me a text this morning wishing Mrs. Cal a happy birthday. He said he’d make her some brownies but he’s in Greece and they may get held up in customs!
My goddaughter Paxton Ford turns 9 today! Happy birthday! https://t.co/lESDT5jzk6

Wanted to share a few pics of the birthday girl! https://t.co/BtZTl2TQKF
It’s my wife, Ellen’s, birthday. Breakfast in bed today, my dear! She has always put everyone else first. Great mother to our children and the players we coached. Her coach’s wife mentality has made our success possible. ❤️ you, Ellen!
Bam! How about a career-high 19 points for @Bam1of1. Never missed a shot last night, 7-7. #NBACats
Happy birthday to @iamnickrichards, @J30_RANDLE and @UKCoachJustus!  Nick is getting better with each and every practice, Julius is grinding in the NBA as a positionless BEAST and Joel has been instrumental in our recruiting efforts.
And he’s doing all this with one eyebrow! #NBACats https://t.co/FczPb4LjOJ
For more on Kevin and his story, watch this video. So proud of him. https://t.co/bEEKtaNF3f

The Thanksgiving birthday girl, @MeganteCalipari, and @TheErinCalipari! https://t.co/FaUlzWJDfa
It’s my Thanksgiving baby’s birthday! I can still remember the day @MeganteCalipari was born on Thanksgiving day in Northampton, Massachusetts. She was a beautiful big-headed baby. LOL! My little girl is 28 today. Happy birthday, Megan!
.@KarlTowns gets Player of the Week! Not only is he having another strong season, his team is winning its division. Keep it up, KAT! #NBACats https://t.co/xcWkfmmMnz
Buzz was a true gentleman and his wife, Betty, was one of original coaches' wives. I'm so happy Betsy and her family are in town.
Betsy's father, Buzz Ridl, was one of the great innovator coaches back in the 50s, 60s and 70s. He coached at both Westminster College and Pitt and led Pitt to the Elite Eight. He and Fran Webster came up with the Amoeba Defense that Jerry Tarkanian adopted.
So glad John Palumbo, Julian Hensel and Ava Ridl, and Betsy Ridl Baun could watch our practice today. https://t.co/7DP67M6epU
I'm excited about what our university and our athletic department are doing for our players. Let me remind you, this is a very small part of a $2.4B rebuild of our campus. #StudentsFirst https://t.co/9qR3qghPHf
.@MikeAndMike, two ultimate professionals, non-agenda guys who spoke their opinions and were always fair for 18 years. What an incredible run by two good people. As they go forward I’ll always be watching and rooting for both. #MMSayThanks
Happy to see @MKG14 back and playing well for Charlotte. Go do your thing Michael!
I know #BBN is going to want to know everything about our new guys. We've got a full breakdown of them at https://t.co/Q7RW2VsQqZ
All three are driven and wired the way you have to be to be successful here. They’re going to add to what we do. We can't wait to get them on campus!
They didn’t need to be begged; they wanted to be here. All three are guards, all three are tough, and all three have a fight and a skill about them. All three of them are gym rats – the kind of guys who come here and do well. https://t.co/n29F1lU9zp
#BBN, please welcome @IQ_GodSon, Keldon Johnson and @raf_tyler to our family. We’ve signed three really good players, really good kids who had a burning desire to be at Kentucky, which tells you they’ve got a toughness to them!   https://t.co/j4Wyp68GrS
I’m proud of how we fought, especially when we got down in both halves. Time to continue to grow and keep trending up.
18 turnovers – six too many. Most of them we tried to make the hardest play.  Lastly, I have to teach them how to finish games and play winning basketball with four minutes to go. That’s on me, not them.
There’s no reason we shouldn’t be a great rebounding team. Need to demand it.  Third, when we get double-teamed in the post we have to do a better job of teaching how we play. It took PJ out of the game. Not fair to him.
After watching the tape and understanding this will be a process with this young team, a few things came to mind:  First of all, 50/50 balls. We have to demand we’re fighting for those.
You know I can’t go without wishing @KarlTowns a happy birthday. Wouldn’t want Karl to get mad at me. LOL. Happy birthday!
Another game-winner by one of ours. @DmillerKY scored a career-high 21 for the @PelicansNBA AND hit the game-winning shot. Proud of you, Darius!
#LaFamilia https://t.co/zn8sS5PWDx
And how about @DakariJohnson! Dakari made his first start last night for the Thunder, scored nine points and OKC got the W. So proud of all his hard work. #NBACats
A new start for @EBled2. Couldn’t be happier for him. 13 points, 4 rebounds and 7 assists in a win last night.
Mark Pope sent this over to me prior to the game last night and I thanked him. This company was started by a Utah Valley student, which is a pretty neat thing. Let me congratulate Mark and his team on a well-played game last night. https://t.co/DAhIAYYETt
Today is Brad’s birthday. I couldn’t be more proud of his growth as a person and what he’s becoming both on and off the court. And yes, he also gets birthday brownies.
It's Veterans Day today, #BBN. We should all send up a prayer for our veterans. We live in freedom because many have fought and risked their lives to protect it. Let's pause at some point in the day to remember that.
Julius is controlling what he can control, which is his play. And you know what, he’s playing as well as he’s played in his life. That’s why I’m proud of him. Can’t wait to see how this unfolds for his family. My guess is better than he even imagined. Proud of you, Julius.
.@J30_RANDLE, who had a dble-dble last night, has shown me something about his character, integrity, and just as importantly, his professionalism. The Lakers chose not to extend his contract, which is their right, but he hasn’t responded negatively - by statements or actions.
It’s hard for me to ever be more proud of one player over another, but when adversity hits, a player’s response says a lot about who he is, how he’s trained, his parents, his coaches and us here at UK.
Another one of my sons had a big week. @J30_RANDLE has surpassed 2,000 points!
Attention #BBN, big basketball weekend in Lexington which includes the Premiere of BOUNCE: The Basketball Opera by my friend @emccorvey. Check it out! https://t.co/voUGAeYEq4
Enjoyed my time w/ the GMs &amp; leadership team @bhgrestaurants. Love their culture. High value of their people = low turnover. People first. https://t.co/FqUcSWfHuC
.@jdavid010, happy birthday! You know how it works at this point, birthday brownies on the way!
Look at what @DakariJohnson and @DrewRoc5 did. They fought. They went for it. To all of our guys, keep grinding!!!
.@AlexTheGreat22 is doing his thing in Indy. What I love is our guys are willing to fight to get NBA contracts.
But I also want to congratulate @derek_willis33 on hitting a game-winner the other night and @MychalMulder getting his first action.
Only players to do it at a younger age than Devin were LeBron, Durant and Carmelo Anthony. Crazy!!!
Congratulations to @DevinBook on becoming the fourth-youngest player to score 3,000 career points in NBA history!
#BBN, it’s one of your favorites’ birthdays today. Join me in wishing @DLamb20 a happy birthday!
My good friend @coachdinogaudio is new to Twitter. #BBN, Coach Gaudio has been good to us! Let’s give him a follow.
Got to visit with Tom Lewis while he was in town for the Lewis Honors College dedication this morning. It was great to meet his family. https://t.co/OCMqcUcml0
Lot of guys played last night. Proud of all of them. And @BeMore27 is starting to make shots! Congrats to @boogiecousins on an NBA first! https://t.co/CGpjZArXF4
Our main focus at this point is getting @_jeyb3 healthy for the rest of his career.
We were hopeful he'd provide immediate shooting, but now it’s like getting a midyear guy who can provide us a lift in the heart of our year.
The good news is, with this surgery we’re going to get this thing right and get @_jeyb3 back during league play. https://t.co/ebkPYaNFM4
Three of our guys with @TreyLyles’ mom. Proud of all of them. https://t.co/zqMOjD7cts

And if you didn't get a chance to donate to @TeamRubicon and still want to, you can text KYCARES to 87872.
We talk about servant leadership w/our guys. I'm grateful they got a firsthand lesson into what it means. Thank you to everyone who helped.
The #BBN has been unbelievable w/its generosity. Between last night &amp; our Teaming Up for Texas telethon, you've helped a lot of ppl in need.
I want to thank everyone who bought tickets to the #KyCaresClassic. When it's all said and done, we'll have raised $500k for disaster relief https://t.co/Z7GL9IjSy7
From Ellen and I both, you ALL are crazy.
Let me thank the nearly 1,000 women from across our state, country and even one from Sweden for making the #UKWomensClinic a success.
Seth Barnett, who has passed, was a HUGE UK fan who D-Fox had befriended. It was great having his mother, Carol, at the #UKWomensClinic! https://t.co/WInKrd9BvR

Normally if a big doesn’t get 40/20 or 35/15 I won’t tweet, but I know how sensitive @KarlTowns is. He got 33pts &amp; 19rbs. Pretty impressive.
Great meetings with Dr. Bob Rotella. Gotta coach BODY, MIND, SPIRIT!!! https://t.co/PPowUKH1I2
It’s @AaronICE2's birthday today. You know what that means?! It’s also @DrewRoc5 birthday today. LOL! https://t.co/HLGVzjoktJ
Happy to announce we’ve given out all 2K student tickets for the KY Cares Classic. All funds going to @TeamRubicon for disaster relief.
Cousins with 41 pts, 23 rbs in a win. Last 3 to do it are @boogiecousins, @AntDavis23 and @KarlTowns. #NBACats
This is what greets me every morning. Love it! It’s the end result of what we are about! https://t.co/25RTuV852q

Donations will go to @TeamRubicon that will directly impact disaster relief. No donation is too small.
I've had a few people tell me they can't make it to our games vs. Morehead State but want to still donate. You can text KYCARES to 87872. https://t.co/k4YCuHtspn
Thank you to the @Pacers for sending this. So proud of @AlexTheGreat22! https://t.co/cyBRXPRLvN

I have so much work to do with this team at the start of the season that I just don’t have time to add anything to my plate.
Last year I did a podcast and I had a ball doing it. With that said, this is a different year. https://t.co/3JbWnPhnl3

All you’ve got to do to be eligible for the scholarship is buy a ticket, use the BBN Rewards app and stay for the entire game.
I'm looking forward to rewarding two UK students with free in-state tuition again for the spring semester! https://t.co/Nu2EA25Wuw

I want to wish all of our guys luck as the NBA season begins. My guess is you will see that number rise as the season goes on. https://t.co/WoAA4a8phs
And if we have talent that has experience, we’re trying to win them all.
I’ll make another statement to you: If it’s between experience and talent, I’m picking talent every time.
Just walked off the floor. I love what I do. I love coaching young players who want to be coached, but boy do we have a long ways to go.
When I announced the news to the team they all went crazy. You go girls!
Just got off the phone with @UKCoachSkinner. @KentuckyVB beat the No. 1 team in the country on the road!

Whether it was through our telethon, another fundraiser or private donations, Kentuckians showed their character.
Couldn’t be more proud of Kentuckians and the #BBN for making donations to Hurricane Harvey, Irma and Maria relief efforts.

With the motor and worth ethic I’ve seen from Jarred, I have no doubt he’s going to be better than ever when he returns.
Right now that’s taking care of this injury and making sure he doesn’t have to worry about it again.
We’ll miss him on the court, but I want what’s best for him and his family.
As I told Jarred, my concern for him is getting this thing right and getting him healthy for the rest of his career.
I’m disappointed for Jarred, but only b/c I know how badly he wanted to get this year started. I’m OK b/c I know this is what’s best for him https://t.co/6eY3WpQsZb

There are all kinds of ways that you can and may have already helped those who have been affected by Hurricane Irma. ...
What disappointed me was I thought they were going to make me up as an old person but they told me, “No, you look old enough.” LOL!
If you were wondering why I was on the set of Uncle Drew last night, it’s because I have a scene in the movie. It’s hilarious!

I'd be remiss if I didn't thank the Red Cross staff for their help throughout the telethon, &amp; our players for answering phones for 3 hours.
Chris, Robert Thomas &amp; Pope Cudd rounded up their teams &amp; put on such a great show. From news, to weather to sports, everything ran smoothly

I enjoyed coaching each one of them. They've all got promising futures.
I'm disappointed we didn't reach our goal but I'm so proud of these kids and how they responded today vs. Spain.
We just had one off night against a good team that made us pay. It's on me that we couldn't do anything to adjust and slow Canada down.
What hurt the most is these are a bunch of good kids who came together in a short period of time and worked hard for three weeks.
Yesterday was tough for our team. Representing our country these past few weeks has been an honor, and to fall short of our goal hurt.

Excited to see @ZayBriscoe, @Dhawk_25, @IsaacHumphries7, @MychalMulder and @derek_willis33 all in NBA camps this summer.
I’ve always enjoyed doing their show and I’m really going to miss those two.
Just went on with @MikeAndMike. One of my favorite shows to go on. All I can tell you is two great guys.
Passing over the Nile River. https://t.co/2lx532r8XZ
Camel races. I won! https://t.co/RHQxquzsQR
Love that I get to share this experience with our guys from Kentucky. @Diallo1Hamidou, @pjwashington_25 and Dr. Mair are having a blast. https://t.co/3fbtgDysEz
Wow, incredible experience at the pyramids with the @usabasketball team!! https://t.co/J7edIcQAau
Off to go see the pyramids in a bit. And by the way, I like my team. And my @usabasketball team too!
Even in Egypt I can’t escape the rumors. Are you kidding me?! It’s 5 in the morning here and this is what I wake up to?
NO ONE has contacted the Knicks on my behalf. I am the coach at Kentucky and will be for a long time!
Saw @WynyardTai today. He looks great!!! Can't wait to watch him play this week.
SSgt. Mohamed Sesay, Sgt. John Bention, Sgt. Chris Hart, Col. Ethan Allen, LCpl. Arnold Rivera and LCpl. Robert Silver from Stanton, Ky.

Should have also mentioned @Dhawk_25, @IsaacHumphries7, @derek_willis33 &amp; @MychalMulder, who we're all hoping to hear their names called too https://t.co/lbIcgnqrCi
In my interview on ESPN, I mentioned @ZayBriscoe basically because teams have been calling me about him.
This is why I love coaching. These mothers' lives are about to change! https://t.co/z5M2HLmNIv
Three lottery picks right here!!! https://t.co/hGrW7yPKml

Still got time to spare to wish @derek_willis33 a happy birthday today. Hope you had a great day, Derek!
Can't wait for tomorrow to see these two plus @AhmadMonk. I have been fielding calls for days! https://t.co/9ByjPDmF6G
But he was great this week at @usabasketball training camp. Proud of him.
My suggestion was that he go back to Lexington to rest it and focus on class, which he is.
He's too important to our season to push it and aggravate it more.
.@kevin_knox23 is going to be fine with some rest, but he and I talked and thought it was in his best interest not to push it.
.@kevin_knox23, who really performed well this week, tweaked his hamstring.
Let me thank all the participants for their time and effort. It was a bunch of great kids.
By the way, when Blake Griffin was in the same situation, he didn’t advance. He’s obviously gone on to great things.
@usabasketball It was hard b/c there were only 3 days. For those that did not make it, we told them to use this as fuel to motivate you to the next level.
On behalf of the entire coaching staff, let me congratulate the @usabasketball committee on the selection of the finalists for the U19 team.

I'm so happy for Kelly Knight Craft and this opportunity for her and Joe Craft as she gets set to become the American ambassador to Canada.
Happy birthday to @UKDeWaynePeevy, a great friend and one of the engines running our athletic department and our @KentuckyMBB program!
I also want to commend the bravery of the other Capitol Police officer who was injured today: Crystal Griner. Unbelievable courage and hero.
#BBN, make sure our prayers are with all those who were injured today in the shooting.
David was hit in the ankle as he charged the gunman. What a hero and what courage. I told him he’s gotta come to a game and do the Y.
Just got off the phone with David Bailey of Capitol Police, one of two police officers who saved a lot of lives today.
Go to the "Father/Son Camp Contest" bucket list on my TimeSet profile for full details!
#BBN, I'm going to be choosing a father and son to attend our third Father/Son Camp (June 30-July 1) for free. Want to come?

Getting great feedback from our players at NBA workouts, especially on @ZayBriscoe. I'm not surprised at all. Keeping doing your thing, Zay!
I want this to be an experience that is impactful for these young players.
I can’t wait to have an opportunity to teach and coach some of the best young talent in our country.
And then to be able to do it w/Danny Manning &amp; Tad Boyle, who I coached at Kansas and have great respect for, will be an amazing experience.
To be able to coach a team that represents the United States is a true blessing.
I wanted to take a moment to reiterate how excited I am to be a part of @usabasketball. I'm excited about the opportunity on a lot of fronts
This schedule is going to be a challenge for us, but my hope is it sets us up for a run at the end of the season.
When you look at who we will play, you’re talking about experienced teams that were in the postseason a year ago and bring back their core.
I think we’ve done that with this schedule.
How do we prepare our guys to be at our best at the end of the season while also putting them in a position to grow and succeed?
We are going to have the youngest team in the history of college bball. We had to take that into account when building this year’s schedule. https://t.co/hjCIY3m18r
You know I'm a history buff. 73 years ago today John Palumbo stormed Omaha Beach on D-Day and was wounded. He just turned 96 a few days ago. https://t.co/u8aVhayvrZ

President John F. Kennedy would have turned 100 today. He encouraged many to a life of service of others, which is why his legacy lives on.

I love the fact that @Diallo1Hamidou wants to put himself in a better position and help lead this new team to a championship.
I’m really proud of @Diallo1Hamidou. He took in all the information, asked a lot of questions, including questions to the NBA teams. https://t.co/UVI9TCaxSE

#BBN, just updated my 2017-18 schedule bucket list on @timesetapp. Check it out now to see the latest update on who we'll play next season.
Here's how you can download TimeSet ...  iOS: https://t.co/9T9DlmcOZ7  Android: https://t.co/XVS4zizlvr
We'll announce a new game for our 2017-18 schedule this afternoon on TimeSet. Download the app and subscribe to the bucket list to find out.
This video can do a much better job of explaining TimeSet than me! Watch this: https://t.co/5aVMQGYx4r
Download TimeSet for iOS here: https://t.co/vIBvXvJNyv  And on Android here: https://t.co/ToiU5LQIbh
The difference: I’ll also use it to show where we want to go and you’ll be able to show me how you follow our team. https://t.co/WhC1tGhLgS
I’ll use TimeSet in much the same way I use my other social media platforms, and that’s to give you an inside look at what we’re all about.
Unlike other social media platforms, TimeSet looks to the future in addition to the present and the past. https://t.co/WhC1tGhLgS
That’s why I want to talk to you about TimeSet, a new social media app we’re going to use in our everyday communications with you.
#BBN, as you know, I’m always looking for what’s next and how we can be the first and the best in everything we do. https://t.co/WhC1tGhLgS

Whatever Hami ultimately chooses to do, he’s gotten so much better in his four months with us and he’s only going to continue to get better.
You’re talking about an athletic guard with great ball skills, an unbelievable finisher and a terrific defender.
It’s in Hami’s best interests to evaluate if now is his time or if he would be better served returning to school.
With the info that will be available to Hami and the feedback he will receive by going through this process, I fully support his decision https://t.co/mXpiHYt0S3

.@IsaacHumphries7 My belief is what you saw of Isaac at the end of this season is just the beginning of his pro career.
.@IsaacHumphries7 Everyone forgets how young Isaac is and how much he’s going to continue to grow and develop. He’s only going to get better and better.
.@IsaacHumphries7 He’s also just 19 years old, the youngest sophomore in the country this past season.
.@IsaacHumphries7 You’re talking about a 7-footer who can shoot and can rebound. That has value anywhere in the world.
.@IsaacHumphries7 I absolutely understand and fully support Isaac's decision and I will do whatever I can to help his dreams come true.
.@IsaacHumphries7 Isaac has gotten so much better in his two seasons here and I believe he’s only begun to scratch the surface of his true potential.
This was a difficult decision for @IsaacHumphries7 but one that he and his mom put a lot of thought into. https://t.co/mDRPyfEhWP
Congrats to Tequan Claitt, who is a friend of Brad's, on posting the top high jump in the country! https://t.co/t3YRgQ5Y4G
To watch four of my guys in the same game last night was special for me. @TyrekeEvans led us to the league title and NCAA tourney run in 09. https://t.co/anufpbymSH
.@J30_RANDLE with 25 points last night in the Lakers' win! So proud to see him living out his dream in LA. https://t.co/tZMS5ke0Ys
Wow, how about how well these two are playing. Their growth has been unbelievable. The future in Sacramento! @THEwillieCS15 @OneBigHaitian https://t.co/5kALDSKHBe
Proud of @AhmadMonk. Won the Jerry West Award tonight as the best SG in the country. Happy I could be here in person to watch him get it. https://t.co/4jF0P4Xssf
.@ZayBriscoe I am so proud of Isaiah's improvement over his time here and am looking forward to seeing his continued growth at the next level.
.@ZayBriscoe Isaiah defends, he rebounds and he creates shots for others. Physically and mentally he’s a pit bull with skills with the ball.
.@ZayBriscoe We averaged nearly 30 wins a season over the last two years and Isaiah played a big part in all of them.
I'm so happy for @ZayBriscoe. He's a fighter, and more importantly, he's a winner. https://t.co/X9w2mciKiz
.@Bam1of1 Every organization needs character and Bam is a high-character kid who only cares about winning.
.@Bam1of1 Bam is a great kid with a ton of upside. Should he decide to stay in the draft, he will be an outstanding four man in the NBA.
.@Bam1of1 Bam has more perimeter skills than people know and is someone with size and a physique that immediately translates to that league.
.@Bam1of1 You’re talking about a player who can guard all five positions.
Whatever @Bam1of1 decides to do, he's got a great future ahead of him. He was our hardest worker this season. https://t.co/I769pVJ6H1
.@AhmadMonk Malik became an efficient player who I believe will make an immediate impact at the next level. Go do your thing, kid!
.@AhmadMonk What I love about Malik is that, as the season went on, he learned how to help our team win by doing more than just score.
.@AhmadMonk With Malik you’re talking about a superior athlete with skills and an ability to score that make him truly unique.
What a great kid and a special talent. I'm so happy for @AhmadMonk and his family. https://t.co/kUvoxhD9jv
.@Swipathef0x What you saw from De’Aaron over the last month and a half of the season I think is what NBA teams will get for the future.
.@Swipathef0x De’Aaron came in here focused from day one, and to see his improvement from the beginning of the season to the end was special.
.@Swipathef0x De’Aaron’s speed, length and ability to pick up defensively from 94 feet set him apart from his peers.
I'm so happy for @Swipathef0x. He's going to be great at the next level. https://t.co/246DZOkyZR
My good friend Mike Rose passed away yesterday. He left us knowing the impact he had on many. Thoughts and prayers are w/him and his family.

.@DevinBook @tulis3 I was so proud of their fight. What they did statistically was impressive, but I was more impressed with their competitive spirit!
Walking around PHX &amp; thinking about @DevinBook &amp; @tulis3's games last night. Devin had 33 &amp; Tyler went for 16 &amp; 13 but it was more than that

Just got out of 3-hr practice. It was 90% D. Carried each other off floor. Nobody puked. Well, may have in locker room but not on the floor.
This is part of that climb to an NBA roster for them. Just the next step in the process.
Congrats to @DakariJohnson and @AlexTheGreat22 on making the NBA D-League All-Star Game. I’m proud of how hard they’ve worked.

Want to thank the team at ServPro of Lexington and @servprosmith for their great work in the Wildcat Coal Lodge on short notice!
He invited me to the Supreme Court to come to his office. What are the chances I take him up on that? (High.)
When he walked in the office, I had the TV on. He and I watched as President Trump nominated the new Supreme Court justice.

I always come back to what you demand is what you get. Today was a great practice.
Just got done with practice. Really focused on us. The guys were really moving the ball and playing today. Gets me excited!!!
New podcast with @Drake is out! He talked about things you haven't heard anywhere else. Now headed into practice!   https://t.co/z8h8rCEowx

Saturday is going to be a tough one against one of the best teams in the country. We will need the #BBN Saturday at Rupp.
The kids had today to take care of their academics and then we are back at it tomorrow with film, practice and meetings.
But I will say this again: These are good kids. I hate to lose, but it’s January. We aren’t where we want to be, but we have time.
If our kids are playing a certain way, it’s because I’ve allowed them to play that way. I’ve been accepting that.
I like my team. We’ve got good kids and a good team. Tennessee was simply better than us last night, and that’s on me.
#BBN, you know how I handle a loss. Been a day of grieving for me, but it’s time for us to move forward.
By the way, Eric Bledsoe had 40 points and 13 assists yesterday. And by the way way, Karl Towns had 32 points and 12 boards. #NBACats
So proud of Terrence Jones. Big night against the Cavs: 36 points and 11 rebounds in a win for the Pelicans. #NBACats

Terrence Jones had 24 points and 12 rebounds last night. Tyreke Evans had 29 points. Julius Randle had 22 points, six boards, five assists.
Get to my desk this AM and look at our NBA player stats. @DevinBook: 39 points, 28 in 4Q alone. @Suns record. Man, I held him back. #NBAVOTE
So proud of our guys. We practiced before class this AM so I can watch @pjwashington_25 and a few young guys play. One of our best practices
The run that Geno Auriemma is on: UNBELIEVABLE. And he's done it twice!!! Had him on my Cal Cast to talk about it.   https://t.co/z8h8rCEowx
Big-time player and scorer for me, Dajuan Wagner. Malik is chasing his numbers!! https://t.co/He4GNWWXBC
This wasn’t expected, but I’m so happy for Hamidou that it’s played out this way where he can come in and focus on getting better.
Hamidou is going to challenge our guys on a daily basis, which is great for our team, and he'll be challenged right back.
Hamidou has a 6-5, 6-6 wing who is an unbelievable defender, athletic, has great ball skills and is a terrific finisher.
It gives him an unbelievable head start on next year, and as I told him, he’s being put in a position to lead next season.
What excited me was that Hamidou wanted more than anything else to train with our guys and to practice. https://t.co/i6VBALgmtP

It's always been a process here because we are always young. We will learn from this and get better.
We have a great group of kids who want to do right, who want to be coached. Now I've got to do my job.
I've got a responsibility to every one of these players, to this program, to this university and all of you. I'm going to take this one on.
I've got another 10 hours to cry in my soup and then we will be back at it.
You know I grieve for 24 hours after a loss but I wanted everyone to know I'm still alive.

New Cal Cast is up! Had Coach K on to talk about his impact w/USA Basketball, what he's done for my players &amp; more.  https://t.co/z8h8rCEowx
I also want to thank @fanoutfitters and @CalipariFund, w/ the help of Jerry Haffey from Ambrosia, for gifts for all members of each family.
Thanks to Jerry Lundergan for the dinner given to the families for Xmas last night, and Kroger for giving each family food for the holidays.
Yep, we’re in camp. Three sessions today, but my hope is the players ask for a fourth. What are the chances Christmas comes early for me?
Three more sessions with the guys today, the first at 11 a.m.
The players had a Christmas meal and gave gifts to nearly 80 people today from our community in the lodge. They also sang some carols. https://t.co/uHUWv1lXpL
Wow!!!! https://t.co/lqFQC8rFga
Time to learn and build from that game. We will have THREE sessions today - at 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and a third session at 7:30 p.m. LET’S GO!!!
It looked like we had won the game, then it looked like we had lost the game, and then our guys figured out how to win the game.
Really happy for the guys because of their will to win. They fought against a terrific opponent.
First thing I saw this morning in Las Vegas. https://t.co/Lu9lD8XzRS
Just landed in Vegas. Heard the sad news about Craig Sager. He was talented, yet kind and even more courageous. RIP.
Want to thank Chuck Osbourn and his staff at Versailles Kroger for hosting me tonight. Great (last) signing. https://t.co/sBFhHcxgxl
Tonight at 6:30 at the Kroger in Versailles (212 Kroger Way) is the last book signing I'm doing. #BBN, this is your last chance to come out.
Long flight tomorrow which means more time to watch film.
We will practice tomorrow morning before we leave for Las Vegas and then practice again while we are out there before Saturday's game.
They took care of finals and now are focused in on getting ready for the weeks ahead with Camp Cal.
Just got done with a great practice. The guys have been really good this week.

It will only be 30 minutes per week from my house. Ellen had to approve because it was her time. First one coming up this week.
When I was told it was another chance to separate our program, be about more than bball &amp; have conversations w/ good friends, I said yes.
I was approached to do a podcast. My answer was, “What’s that?”
I’m always looking for what’s next and how we can be first. It happened with Twitter, Facebook and having a world-class website.
I did ask @Lj_era8, "Do you have to come back another year?!"
I know some of the #BBN is going to be mad I took this, but what a great kid. And he's the Heisman Trophy winner!! https://t.co/m1EFBTfAnf
No more off days for any of us. Camp Cal! Stay tuned.
I’ll be on the @dpshow, @TheHerd, @MadDogUnleashed, @MSNBC and @oreillyfactor to talk about UK, the book and college basketball.
As the guys go into finals and have an off-day today, I stayed in New York to do some media.

Am I the only old person who knows what a mimeograph is?! And don't Google it either.
Talking to my guys about getting a copy of a speech I made. I told them I didn't want a mimeograph either. They both said, "No such word."

Also, how about @J30_RANDLE going for 13 points and 20 rebounds and @JohnWall having 15 points and 15 assists. Wow.

When I walk into each game at Rupp, I first look to see if Ellen is there yet, and my second look is to see if Coach Hall is in his seat.
Happy birthday to Coach Hall! I love walking into practice and seeing him on the sideline.
Happy birthday to my wife, Ellen. After 30 years of marriage she still looks great.
Happy birthday, @J30_RANDLE! Playing great ball in LA. Bright future!

Great experience for our guys yesterday. Learned a lot about servant leadership. https://t.co/qIL1ibv3Ul

#BBN, new season means new episodes of The Mailbag. Got a question? Go to my Facebook page to ask it to me and I may answer it on the show.
#LaFamilia https://t.co/iliqbv1hEL
The 2017 class is starting to shape up. We’re not done yet bc we’re going to lose three seniors &amp; four or five underclassmen from this team.
They understand they’re coming here because they want to be the best version of themselves.
They’re sharers. They’re going to be servant leaders to each other. They’re going to be great teammates.
I’m excited about these kids. Each one of them, just like the guys on this current team, they’re great kids.
#BBN please join me in welcoming Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Quade Green, Nick Richards @ P.J. Washington. GREAT kids!  https://t.co/NKbEBZbrg0

Just landed in NYC. Already missing Garf. No doubt we would have had a great meal and talked 5 Star lore tonight. I miss my friend!
One last thing on the book that's coming out tomorrow. If you pre-order now you can receive a signed bookplate. https://t.co/FzMILxqNpI https://t.co/HKDn3S88lY
My focus is on Tuesday's game. I'll focus on Wednesday when it gets here.
The book is about coaching young, extreme talent. The process and the challenges. I think it's a good read, but that's just me.
As I'm in the middle of my preparation with Michigan State, I was reminded I have a book coming out Tuesday. https://t.co/EtQ2VJHjyF
Only life &amp; death is life &amp; death, &amp; our military faces that every day. Proud to be an American. God bless our military. Happy Veterans Day.
My wife watched Hacksaw Ridge two days ago. It reinforces the sacrifice our military has made to protect us and our freedoms.
Happy birthday to my baby boy @bradcalipari! https://t.co/OitqTGo4rh

I love that we shared the ball, but we gotta execute better on both ends. Nine 3s in a conference game will lead to an L.
For our first exhibition game I'm proud of the guys. BUT we have a long way to go, especially defensively.
These guys have been with me since the start. My high school coach, Bill Saaco, my college coach, Joe DeGregio, and Skip Tatala! https://t.co/d9OCTpZZs2
How about Dr. Greg White, our honorary assistant coach of the game tonight. He called the first offensive play ... and we scored! https://t.co/IYmoieLzqE

For the fourth year we'll pay for one semester of in-state tuition for two lucky students at the Blue-White Game. https://t.co/JTxhrrqawZ https://t.co/k7hVZEraSd
It proves my point that if you want to be significant, it's about selflessness. Think about what they gained by playing at Kentucky.
They also picked @DevinBook for the breakout player of the year in 2016-17.
Just heard the NBA GMs said that if they could start an NBA franchise with any player it would be @KarlTowns. Last year it was @AntDavis23.
Thanks to Kimmye Bohannon, owner of @weeklyjuicery, for dropping off the blue superfood smoothies today. The staff loved them. https://t.co/iOyZG7gBI7

Red Ventures clinic this morning. Great people. Lots of fun and all for charity! https://t.co/LOLTJ59mF9
Now at dinner with two of my other sons. Who picks up the tab? https://t.co/ad8cL97Bpe
He hasn't changed a bit. https://t.co/GYtTqpNyvZ
My dear friend Willard Sparks would have been 80 today. Man I miss him!
With Luis Da Silva! https://t.co/0fhYDokegQ
And here's the third! I hear he's pretty good. https://t.co/ogbKNIDkwh
Here's two of the three I came to see tonight. https://t.co/Yf9ehu7sIL
I'm going to see three of my children play tonight. Who might they be?
But we’re in the business of making the impossible possible. #LoveMyTeam
Becoming the best defensive team in the country is going to take a lot of work and is very difficult for young players.
Their support and enthusiasm for one another was amazing. Now the real work begins.
For two days our players played in front of all 30 NBA teams. I couldn’t be more proud. Every player helped themselves.
The Krebs Effect! Happy birthday, @MarkKrebsJr! https://t.co/9HHyT8UDqM
Our guys are going through the preseason grind, but they're bringing it and getting better. #SuccessIsTheOnlyOption https://t.co/Oy9gGMFBpK https://t.co/vOYTjc6vkW
And here are the other three panels: https://t.co/mXJdLQwG7A
The shoes feature six panels with all 30 guys on them. Here are the first three: https://t.co/7c6d3bneOZ
I may auction them off for charity. I may not. Pretty special shoes. I'll let the #BBN know.
Got a special pair of shoes I'm wearing tonight. First names of all 30 guys who've gone to the NBA over the last seven years are on them. https://t.co/ywSWnjvAMw
You can watch tonight's practice at 7 p.m. on ESPNU or online at https://t.co/lf3dfLzAti.
What’s really great is most of the teams will stay and watch practice tomorrow and see what we do every day to prepare these kids.
It's so great for them to experience what’s in their future.
I’m so excited for our players to be able to perform tonight in front of all 30 teams and 90 NBA staff members.
Big Blue Madness is Friday night, but you can get your first glimpse of our guys at practice tonight at 7 on @ESPNU. #BBN https://t.co/Wk6FptqGvv
Enjoyed speaking with Gray Construction. Had a chance to speak with this group three years ago. Excited to see their growth and success! https://t.co/xgd2TCqwEy
#BBN, still time to register to attend our Coaches' Clinic at the end of the month. HOFer Larry Brown will be there! https://t.co/PsKARt6s9d https://t.co/cKVtqQh9HJ
Stopped at Melissa's Cottage for desserts. Wow. Ellen stopped to pick up stuff at 5 Seasons Gift Gallery. Great morning in Versailles.

Enjoyed getting to speak to members of the Louisville police today before the Wildcat Tipoff Luncheon. https://t.co/4WKfcoJU0W
Wow!!!! #BBN comes through again! https://t.co/Iolf3CaKTJ
I feel I have the best staff in the country. I’m excited to see how this new structure improves our ability to help kids reach their dreams.
Joel went out in June &amp; July and did great. It was eye-opening to me to watch him evaluate and form relationships. https://t.co/ESKdxjHyjQ
Joel’s been with us for two years and has brought a lot to UK. Seeing him recruiting showed me we need to give him a chance to do his thing.
Robes is the best in the business at preparing for an opponent, and I can’t think of anyone else filling that role. https://t.co/ESKdxjHyjQ
Robes has been and will continue to be my closest confidant. In this role he will continue to help me prep for games, as he’s always done.
I want to explain why we’re making the move, how we got to this point, and why I believe it’s best for all parties. https://t.co/ESKdxjHyjQ
Joel will join Kenny and Tony as an assistant coach. John will take over Joel’s role as a special assistant to me. https://t.co/ESKdxjHyjQ
This wasn’t planned, but after watching Joel work and knowing John’s strengths, which are many, I’ve decided to make this change permanent.
This summer we put Joel Justus on the road recruiting while we gave John Robic time to be w/ his family after the sudden passing of his dad.
Our focus is OUR team and our PLAYERS. Plays and schemes change each year. Our approach does not! #PlayersFirst!
The beginning of another season starts this weekend. We start the journey to find the BEST VERSION of us!
I also want to thank everyone at the #BBMcampout for your support. Nothing like this week. Best fans in the world.
And of course, can't thank Amy Nicholson, Bernie Fussenegger &amp; everyone at @PapaJohns for their help with the Louisiana flood relief efforts https://t.co/BlncRBMb2n
I want to thank Dave Rhodes, Bobby Sageser and @PapaJohns for providing the #BBMcampout with food tonight. #BBN loved it. https://t.co/tyxFrBIb0i
With Sophie Robic at UAB. Having fun playing softball! https://t.co/St9oF9BaXF
#BBN, won't get back from recruiting in time to make it out to the #BBMcampout tonight but I will be there tomorrow for #TentCity.
I’ll be out recruiting today but I’ll be back tonight &amp; hope to see everyone and then I’ll be back again on Thursday for the Tent City show.
The good news is there is still room to camp out if you want to come out. This lot is still open. https://t.co/OTn5Xyuc49
W/the construction happening on campus, this year’s #BBMcampout became a little more of a challenge. I appreciate everyone’s understanding.
HOFer Larry Brown will be at our Coaches’ Clinic Oct. 29 &amp; attendees will learn valuable coaching lessons. Register: https://t.co/PsKARt6s9d https://t.co/6fZ5xKlwjF
This is an amazing picture. Five guys from one school!!! LOL. Maybe another first. Proud of all of them. https://t.co/Q7WlAwsNSj
Happy birthday to one of the hardest workers I've ever coached, @MKG14. Can't wait to see you on the court again!
Good luck to all the NBA players, esp. our 30 guys reporting to NBA training camp Monday. It’s an exciting time of year for all. Go for it.
Sad day for golfers and golf fans worldwide, but especially those from western PA, icon Arnold Palmer passed away. RIP

Sad to hear Charles Hurt, former @KentuckyMBB player and KY state champ out of Shelby County, passed away today. Prayers for his family.

I want to wish Dr. Karpf and his wife nothing but the best as they take on the next challenge.
Dr. Karpf, a good friend who has done so much for university and the medical school, is retiring.

Happy 46th birthday to @MrJoshHopkins! Was great having him at the softball game a couple weeks ago.
You’ve done your homework. Trust yourself. You know what’s true and what’s not. #PlayersFirst
It’s not about opinions. It’s about real numbers. They carry the day.
I don’t take the opportunity to hear their stories and dreams lightly. We want to chase their dreams with them.
I’ve been in nine states and 12 cities to build relationships with young people and their families.
Nothing excites me more than what I’ve done the last few days.
Chris Simmons bday today. Been with me over 10 years! The best at what he does!
Remembering the lives of those we lost 15 years ago. Praying for their families &amp; the brave ppl who helped so many that day. #NeverForget
My big man from years past Chris Massie turns 40 today. He's still playing professionally! Happy birthday!

May we honor hard work and opportunity on this Labor Day!
Our family began the American Dream through the coal mines in Clarksburg, WV. Learning to GRIND has been passed down through generations.
This nation was built by people driven to perfect their task, to continually learn and to bring people together so all benefit.
Hats off to all those who have worked and toiled to make a better life for their family – both blue and white collar.
What a day. Lunch w/ George Cates. Practice w/ my team. Dinner w/ Giddel Padilla &amp; Butch Lee. OL in between. NICE! https://t.co/cIT122GNxR

Great to see Tayshaun back in our gym continuing to work on his game. He embraces the grind. https://t.co/94e0r4FaLX

That doesn't count what Papa John's is going to do, which should bring in even more.
We partnered with the Red Cross to donate more than $300k for Louisiana flood relief.
Unbelievably successful weekend capped off by a softball game that was a ball. The players enjoyed it. The fans enjoyed it. I had a blast.

My hope is this book might resonate with other leaders in similar positions. https://t.co/fqzm8g5OFn
This book is about how we get the most out of elite talent, create a culture of brotherhood and form a team with such talented individuals.
I’m always asked, ‘How in the world do you get such talented kids to come together and play for one another?’ This new book is that story.

Exactly right. The “how” changes year to year. “How” we achieve our “why” can change, but why we do this never does. https://t.co/vsBMxUSpbL
If I asked the #BBN what our “why” is – why do we do what we do – what would your answer be?
If u walk in a gym and you’re by far the most talented, wrong gym. If u walk in &amp; say, “Wow, what talent,” that's the right gym. That’s UK.
I talked to a kid who has great aspirations and wants to play with other great players.

When you combine the teams we’re playing with the travel we have, this might be the toughest schedule we’ve ever attempted.
Building a schedule to challenge our players is not an easy task, and sometimes we go too far. Hopefully this isn’t one of those years.
We also try to prepare them for that March run, which is what this program has been built on.
What we try to do with our schedule every year is challenge our players with the best teams in the country.
Our 2016-17 nonconference schedule is out. What do you think, #BBN? https://t.co/XqIuZrnRaY https://t.co/DodNdGpLj2

I don't care how we looked, it's never a bad day when I get a chance to work with our guys.
There's nothing better than being on that court with my team. https://t.co/7yIgAbbTSW
You want scoring to go up? Automatic foul if the shooter is touched before his feet hit the floor. This my next mission.
It's obvious we are teaching this. There should be NO CONTACT TO THE BODY THROUGHOUT THE SHOT. Elbow, wrist tap, stomach tap, etc.
Everything in our game trickles down. Watching games this weekend and see that every close out to a jump shooter results in a foul.
So happy for @DrewRoc5. He's worked so hard to earn his new deal with the Grizzlies. He'll be in the league for a long time.
I heard @DevinBook and @tulis3 had it going just like old times. Devin w/28 pts, 8 rebs, 6 assts. Tyler had 11 pts, 7 assts 5 rebs. Amazing!
How about @DrewRoc5 tonight?! 23 points, four rebounds and four assists. Floor general who deserves an opportunity in the league.
I don’t think this is the end for him, but no matter what he chooses to do, I’m confident he’ll have success. https://t.co/X7cPhIrPSE
Coach Brown is one of the great coaches of all-time and has helped start many careers, including my own. https://t.co/X7cPhIrPSE
There’s no doubt in my mind Coach Brown still has gas left in the tank. He’s one of the most self-disciplined and driven people I’ve met.
As I'm sure you've heard, Larry Brown – a mentor to me, a friend, a supporter and confidant – is stepping away. https://t.co/X7cPhIrPSE
We’re always looking for players who want to do a little bit more and aren’t afraid of this challenge. #HelpingFamilies

I’m ready to bust some new stuff out. I may have some thoughts for the #BBN in the coming days.
After 17 hours in an airplane and five hours in a car getting back and forth to games, I’ve had my first quality time to think in a while.
#BBN, @KarlTowns is gonna be back on campus Aug. 3 to work with our campers. Don’t miss this opportunity! Register: https://t.co/XofJBecH2k
Would there be a WNBA without her influence? Rest in peace, Pat. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
HOFer Pat Summitt, a true ambassador for our sport, has also passed away. She championed women everywhere &amp; created opportunities for them.
Thoughts and prayers are with Buddy and his family.
I’ve always had great respect for Buddy and his sons, especially Rex, who talked to our 2014-15 team after we won the SEC Tournament.
Buddy Ryan, who after an illustrious NFL coaching career retired to Kentucky and had been in our practices a few times, has passed away.
Flight back from Barcelona was pretty uneventful. Gotta give a shoutout to Delta, esp. our purser Jackie Wynne, who treated us like royalty.

Walking in Barcelona &amp; run into Alex Gross, Houston Lichtefeld &amp; Adam Lucas, UK students interning here this summer https://t.co/INUbF4SVnz
Music wise I'll be listening to Train and might throw some Drake in there. Taking off now!
And no one got all the movies AND the music. I'm going to watch the Godfather, Patton and a Bronx Tale.
I asked if I would get it back.   Sweating I went to the Sky Club with half of Atlanta! I love this!!!  Off to Barcelona!!
They laughed! Told me I had something in my pocket. I said I didn't have anything but two twenties. They said that goes through the screener
Went to security. Wrong line, They asked me to take my belt off. Pants fell down. Made me take my shoes off which showed the hole in my sock
At the airport and about to head to Spain. Went to the wrong line three times. Had no chance with the self check. Felt like I was at Kroger.
If you can guess all three movies, the one band, and the era it's from, I'll send you a signed UK shirt. You have to get all of them right.
Later today I'm jumping on a 12-hour flight to Spain to watch a couple games. I've got three movies and some music downloaded on my iPad.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Herky’s family. #BBN, please join us.
He was immensely proud and honored that his father was one of the great coaches of all time. He’ll be missed.
Herky always had great stories to tell and he would always set the record straight.
He was a great supporter of not only our basketball program, but myself and my family. I loved being in his company.
Herky Rupp passed away this week. He was the only son of Adolph, the husband of Linda and the father of Chip and Farren.
I’m so proud of each of our kids, and I am so excited to watch them as their careers continue to grow. https://t.co/o4JX154rTj
But at the end of the day, every one of our kids has an opportunity to reach their dreams, and that’s what we’re in the business of doing.
I want the best for our kids and I want them to be drafted in the best position. I’d like all of my guys to be drafted in the top 10 picks.
This morning, as I looked back on the NBA Draft, I tried to put things in the right perspective. https://t.co/o4JX154rTj
It was a long day for me and I started to fade, but I made it. I toughed it out! Time to get to bed.
They’ve all earned this and have chased their dreams. I know they’ll all be ready for more.
At the end of the day, it was still a life-changing draft for several of our players and their families. I’m just so proud of the guys.
I’m confident Alex will get a contract just like Aaron Harrison last season.
Although Alex didn’t get drafted, I’m proud of the position he’s put himself in after what he went through a year a half ago.
I always wish the guys were drafted in better positions, but we got three in the league and all with good organizations.
It was another nerve-wracking night waiting for draft picks to be made.
These are my guests at the draft. Let's do this! https://t.co/fCnM39KX9l
My brother Chris Arington is doing much better. Prayers answered! Keep them coming.

They both understood the grind to make a better life for all their children. I hope I've measured up to their bar with my own children.
My dad, Vince, and father-in-law, Ray, are both terrific role models and hard workers.
To all the dads and grandfathers, happy Father's Day. Hope you're w/ loved ones &amp; have an opportunity to be appreciated and pampered today.
Loved getting to share @MKG14's story with the campers today. He gets embarrassed by it, but it's true!

On behalf of all the coal miners in Kentucky, our foundation is making a donation to Moose International. Once again, thank you.
They’ve cont’d to help communities across USA. As you know, my family started the American Dream in the coal mines of Clarksburg, W.Va.
I became more interested the more I learned. The org. started 100 yrs ago to help families of coal miners who were injured/killed in mines.

Brad knows he’s walking into a program with really good players and that he’s going to have to strive to be his best.
Brad chose to go to prep school on his own and it ended up being a great decision. It was also his decision to be a part of this team.

You could even have the winner's bracket on one court and the loser's bracket on the other court.
You could play the games where fans can go from side to side and watch multiple games.
Why don't we play the games in the football stadium in Atlanta and set up two courts with stands split down the middle?
I'm sure you've heard about my crazy idea for the SEC Tournament being played before the season. Got another crazy idea while I was driving.

I fully expect Isaiah to come back and be a leader on and off the court for this young team. I’m excited to have him back.
Without Isaiah's impact and competitive spirit, last year’s team would not have been nearly as successful.
Isaiah shot the ball well at the NBA workouts but will look to continue to improve that to take the next step in his career.
All the teams were impressed w/Zay physically, defensively, his rebounding ability, his strength, his ball-handling ability &amp; his bball IQ.
Zay used the new rules by working out for NBA teams to get a true barometer on where he stands at this point. https://t.co/DfipHL5KMV

Keep those prayers for Chris Arington coming!!! The most powerful tool we have, #BBN.
Posted this last week before I went to the hospital to see him. I told him then &amp; I’ll say it again: Love you, Garf. https://t.co/CJO3QT7VS0
My career, and many others, were started by him in the Five-Star Basketball Camp.
A really sad day for all of basketball. Howard Garfinkel, an icon who changed the game in many ways, passed away today.

In part one, we’re looking back at what I said in my first press conf. here. As you can see, there’s #NoFlipFlop. https://t.co/Fev9dHatEW

I told you yesterday a weight-training video was coming today. Here it is, #BBN: https://t.co/dCpEkBBtJF
I love you, Garf. https://t.co/CJO3QT7VS0
Without him, I’m not the coach at Kentucky. The things that have happened in my life you can trace back all the way to Five-Star.
Age is beginning to get the better of Garf, but he still has the same twinkle in his eye, the same devious smile and the same caring heart.
If you were helping players improve, and you could coach and teach the game, you didn’t have a bigger supporter than Howard Garfinkel.
Garf, among many other things, started the Five-Star Basketball Camp with Will Klein. https://t.co/CJO3QT7VS0
I’ve been so blessed to have “bumped” into people who have helped my career – none more so than Howard Garfinkel. https://t.co/CJO3QT7VS0
Saw @1CMatthews today. He’s starting to work his way back. Can’t wait to see him in summer workouts.
Congrats on the championship, DeAndre! Keep fighting and keep competing.
Getting back at it. Time to get back in shape. Weight-training video will be tomorrow!  https://t.co/76kiQ5SXJJ
He was at the center of a movement that made life better for many, and he will be missed.
He was on the balcony at the Lorraine Motel when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.
Rev. Kyles was a great leader and a great motivator, but more importantly he was a person who moved people to do right.
A friend and mentor, Rev. Billy Kyles passed away Tuesday in Memphis.
Look who's back in town for #CATSPYS2016! Great to see @TreyMambaLyles. https://t.co/iHAqhiXkiL
They were all proud fathers watching our young staff try to figure out our profession. #BBN, please keep John Robic's family in your prayers
At UMass, my dad, Billy Bayno's dad, John's dad, and Bruser Flint's dad, who passed away more than a decade ago, would all be at our games.
John Robic's father, John, passed away this weekend. I've known Mr. Robic since I was 15. Good man who was actively involved w/his children.
Happy birthday to @DPull32! Dillon, your birthday brownies will be at the office later this week. #BBN, do your thing.

Also, I'll be on @foxandfriends with @edhenry at 6:30 a.m. tomorrow. It’s early, but you know I’ll figure out how to throw in our UK stuff.
Also, our No. 1 recruit had nine points on three 3-pointers at the Derby Classic.
Malik and De’Aaron named co-MVPs of the @JordanClassic. I’m so happy for those two, but I’m just as happy with how Bam and Wenyen played.
Congrats to Michael Stone and the CATS staff for the tremendous support they offer our kids. They continue to be the best in the country.
This APR honor is based on the last four seasons &amp; shows our kids are loyal to themselves, their families, this program and this university.
If you look over our time, we’ve done it each and every season and continue to improve in all areas.
The challenges our guys have as student-athletes in our program are not for everybody.
This APR award shouldn’t be a surprise to the student body at UK because they are classmates with the kids in our program.
7 years ago I said we'd recruit the best &amp; the brightest that would excel on the court, in class &amp; in the community. https://t.co/Yql46vIrxE
It's @ZayBriscoe's birthday! Mrs. Cal will be in Monday with your brownies. Happy birthday, Isaiah!
Seth and his family are from Kentucky. Seth had an incredible passion for @KentuckyMBB. #BBN, please keep Seth &amp; his family in your prayers.
Terribly saddened to hear we’ve lost Seth Barnett. I met Seth when I visited with @Swipathef0x and his family. https://t.co/Gf0dsC0IGE

One of the best EVER! https://t.co/9upCeG0su5
Couldn't be happier for Tyler and his family. I've had a lot of really good PGs, but never had a Cousy Award winner. https://t.co/uJBwIzgf8i
.@MarthaStewart and my baby girl @MeganteCalipari in blue. https://t.co/57h9xvHy3n
I’m going to miss him dearly because now it appears that all the coaching will fall back on my lap. LOL!
After two years, at his size, projected as a middle first-rounder – it’s truly an amazing story in itself.
I still remember the comments when we signed Tyler: ‘Cal finally got himself a four-year point guard!’
On the offensive end, not only was Tyler efficient, he accounted for 17.3 points and 7.0 assists per game.
Tyler did it on both ends of the floor. Being named the defensive POY in the SEC is quite an honor if you look at the past award winners.
Tyler coached the team this season as much as I did, and I’m proud to say that.
What I loved is he grew into that position. You couldn’t speed him up and you couldn’t slow him down unless he wanted to.
I’ve coached a lot of great leaders and great PGs in all my years of coaching. Tyler Ulis is the best floor general that I’ve ever coached.
This is what it's about! So happy for Tyler and his family. https://t.co/OsmhZod8uX
Skal's future is out ahead of him &amp; I think in time he will be in the same breath as all of our big guys who have performed well in the NBA.
but Skal's improvement over the year is why he is in this position to put his name in the draft &amp; be projected in the middle of the lottery.
On the basketball court, it took him and our staff a while to figure out how to best utilize him ...
Skal is one of the greatest kids I’ve ever coached.
He was a great student, a great teammate and I’m so proud of the way he handled himself in the community.
I couldn’t be more proud of a player and the way Skal handled himself on our campus this season. https://t.co/EqIeQcNGgi
Can you all name these basketball legends? https://t.co/yXgmilL9AC
With Denny Crum and his wife, Susan. Coach Crum received the Naismith Outstanding Contributor award. Well-deserved! https://t.co/mYGvm8wzxU
With Tyler and his dad. A @NaismithTrophy finalist! He had an unbelievable season. Proud of you, kid. https://t.co/jJfsUL4Tky
What I love about Jamal is he's a great teammate who has a smile on his face every day. I'm going to really miss coaching him.
He grew into a true winner and one of the most efficient scorers.
The improvement Jamal showed over the course of the season may be unmatched by anyone I've ever coached.
What a great moment for Jamal &amp; his dad. Wish I could have been there in person. Jamal is one of the greatest kids. https://t.co/0PirR0ekfX
My new recruit isn't a bad shooter. LOL. https://t.co/ySFEC07TQE

DeAndre Liggins is 28?! Has it really been that long since I coached him?? Happy birthday, DeAndre. Hope you have a great one.
Tyler Ulis is a consensus first-team All-American. First player since 1958 at his size (Don Hennon). Incredible!!!   https://t.co/sdzdzP9jax
I'll say it again: What this group did this season was incredible. Every player got way better. GREAT video.   https://t.co/lSktIddUbl
Happy Easter to all the #BBN across the country. Please remember how blessed we've all been and pass those blessings along to others.
Had dinner with @TerrenceJones1 and now watching a game with one of my favorites, Julius Mays. https://t.co/trzqEuqJLj
And how about @J30_RANDLE with his first triple-double? 13 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists!
Great night for @THEwillieCS15, who had a career-high 26 points, six rebounds, three steals and two blocks last night.
To get your tickets for tomorrow's @UKHoopCats game, head to https://t.co/L7ZQDa9V6C
Calling all of the #BBN: We need you to pack @Rupp_Arena tomorrow for @UKCoachMitchell and the @UKHoopCats. https://t.co/TVaKedg1xz
As I said, it's a win-win for the student athletes. I like the rule.
Players not invited to the combine know what that means. Players invited to the combine and told to to back to school know that that means.
Just so you know, having every kid put their name in the draft is about all players getting the right information.
It's a true win-win for the student-athlete.
The new rule states they can submit their name a total of three times. If they choose to withdraw, they have until 10 days after the combine
... in hopes of being invited to the combine in May.
With that being said, every player who is eligible for the draft, including our walk-ons, will submit their names for the NBA Draft ...
When the season’s over, it’s about each individual player and what’s right for them and their families.
Met with our team today. Told them that during the season it’s about the team and sacrificing for each other – which they did this year.
Happy birthday, EJ!!! Let's wish him a happy one, #BBN!  https://t.co/HQTbpJpoz5
Congratulations to @UKCoachMitchell and the @UKHoopCats on the big win tonight. Let's pack @Rupp_Arena on Friday.  https://t.co/4sNURZAMoh

The last five minutes, I'm asking that everyone watching today's game stand and help us finish this out.
Just got off the treadmill. Thinking about this game today, it's going to be a war. Going to need the #BBN in a big way.

We’re getting better. Now we have to figure out, if Derek can’t play, how do we play?
They fought and put us in a position to win and things happened out of their control. Can’t be mad at that.
It’s really simple: I feel really good about the game because our kids fought.
Players couldn’t understand why I wasn’t mad about the loss yesterday. They’ve never seen me this way after a game like that.
Took communion this morning for the oldest active Committee of 101 member and huge UK fan John Walters. Keep him in your prayers, #BBN.
It's @TheErinCalipari's bday! I remember racing Ellen to Magee hospital in Pitt 29 years ago! She came into this world walking and talking!

Reggie Warford &amp; his wife, Marisa, came by to watch practice today. Reggie was on staff with me when I was at Pitt. https://t.co/DvgClgQiQB

Michael Kidd-Gilchrist 2nd game back goes for 19 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists. A healthy MKG = all-star. Btw, another D/D by KAT. Crazy.
Happy birthday to my dad, Vince. Still going strong. Always a grinder, always a gatherer. Love you, Dad.
Started to go in but too many students. It all brings back great memories. Over 30 years ago. Where did the time go?
Was driving around campus last night with John Robic, who also started his career at Kansas. We drove by the Wheel in honor of Dr. Woo.
From Iowa St, to KU, to S. Carolina, to UMass, to Marshall, his alma mater. Bob made it happen for young people and coaches at every stop.
One of the great ADs of all-time, Bob Marcum. https://t.co/NwUqftb8S7
Every building we go to is a T-shirt night. Whiteout. Blackout. You name it. Tomorrow may be the first time we'll have multiple colors.
Max Falkenstien was the longtime radio guy for Kansas. He was here when I was 30 years ago! https://t.co/RQvq1Vkfjh
Landing in Topeka, Kan., home of Mark Turgeon. A great coach and one of my favorites!
I bet Kansas is happy this guy's not coaching tomorrow. He was 12-1 against them! Amazing stuff. https://t.co/ChCWcHjTcx
#BBN, I filmed a new episode of The Mailbag on some of the pleasant surprises from the first half of the season. https://t.co/goMkCfZAKS

I wish Winston was alive today so I could ask him: "What about the dogs chasing you? Can you throw rocks at them?" LOL!!!
Wow, great advice for coaching at Kentucky!!! https://t.co/PYYm6fBPjp
Putting players in the right positions is a part of this. I'm still trying to figure this team out, be patient with me.
Talked with @DickieV. He was very impressed with our defense, pace of game and teamwork.
D-Cuz 48 points?! Really, KAT? Ballin. Archie Goodwin 20-plus in two straight, plus the game-winner last night. I'll stop there ...
So good to see Tom Brown, my high school coach from my sophomore year. https://t.co/JzbKK3Zy0x

I'm a few days late on this but wanted to wish @thekevin_massey a belated happy birthday. What a blessing he's been to all of us.
1. Big-picture thinking. 2. Creative thinking. 3. Reflective thinking. All change you mentally and change your mood. It has helped me!
My good friend John Maxwell said there three ways to change your thinking, especially when it's stinkin' thinkin'!! ...
Eddie Sutton, a longtime friend and a great coach. Glad I got to spend time with him after the game. https://t.co/0Nr2IQrZpV
We’ve come a long way and still have a ways to go, but with the right mentality we can continue to make progress. https://t.co/CzuTboaePH
I tell my team they should feel a sense of responsibility for all those before them who risked their lives to make the world a better place.
It’s late, but I’ve been thinking about Martin Luther King, Jr. and his impact, and wanted to share some thoughts. https://t.co/CzuTboaePH

I am not negotiating with ANYBODY. My total focus is on this team and winning the next game.
You may have heard me say this before: I absolutely have the best coaching job in sports and I plan on being at Kentucky for a long time.
Just ran into Ted Garber from my Umass days. His father was a UMass legend coaching lacrosse. The good ole days!
Jersey Red kept us all smiling yet looked after his friends. #BBN, please pray for him and his family.
Jersey Red passed today. A character who's time at Kentucky is well documented. He lived life his way!
Two of my biggest supporters and friends! https://t.co/DWG5dd25S3
SEC play is always a grind. This week in The Mailbag I talk about what our focus is in league play: https://t.co/psXuBjwAYC
I believe in this team of players. We have to work toward empowering them. THAT'S ON ME! It's a process. https://t.co/gvmcxTHmwl
Players have to trust, and the coach has to create a culture of what's acceptable and what isn't, and then the team moves forward.
#BBN, my job as a coach is to transform and move a team toward its best version. https://t.co/gvmcxTHmwl
What's better than one birthday? Two! Happy birthday to Tyler and Isaac, our shortest and tallest players. Brownies waiting for you in Lex.
#BBN say a prayer 4 longtime friend of the program Bobby Flynn who took a spill today. Ellen &amp; I plan to visit him in the hospital tomorrow

Pope Francis said if you create opportunities for others you create opportunities for yourself. Let's all commit to that mindset!
Happy New Year, #BBN!  My hope is that the past year was rewarding and this year a true blessing for you and yours!
Took a break from Camp Cal to answer a couple questions from The Mailbag on Dom and Tyler. Check it out: https://t.co/yWUDiTgp2H
We had two hard practices today. I'm getting soft though. Giving them OFF tonight. Tomorrow back at it!!
Two good sessions today. Off to see Bam play De'Aaron in NC. KP and Robes have the evening session. Keep grinding! Love it!
Happy belated birthday to John Y. Brown, Jr. our former governor and a great friend to me, the program and university.
Off to the radio show after our second practice today and dinner. Then it's on to number three.
Evaluating guys is one thing, personal attacks are another. These are young kids and they deserve better.
Ultimately they've got to do it, but if anyone wants to attack one of my kids personally, they won't be welcomed here.
Kids grow at their own pace &amp; shouldn't be judged by anyone else's timetable. We're here to serve these kids &amp; help them reach their dreams.
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Every one of my players is on their own timetable.
I told you we weren't very good! LOL. Merry Christmas! https://t.co/RWll6iKjh5
We are back at it tonight at 8.
The players gave out gifts &amp; sang carols. They weren't very good but it was really funny. Any guesses who Santa is? https://t.co/tIdHdgOr7J
Had a spirited practice this afternoon. Afterwards we had dinner with 10 families from the Lexington area.
My friend &amp; UK fan from the 90s Ken "Jersey Red" Ford is in the hospital struggling. Let's send out powerful #BBN prayers to him &amp; family!
Time to get back to basics, and all that in the face of playing a really good Louisville team. These are challenges that excite me.
We've got to teach them winning time/situational basketball and the role that grit plays in this. It's a process, and you can't skip steps.
Now the question becomes, how do we start moving forward? This is a good basketball team that will have a chance in every game we play.
I asked myself, if we would have closed out that game and won, would I have felt differently? No, because our challenges haven't changed.
Getting away from my team the last two days gave me a chance to really think.
A new episode of The Mailbag is on the site. This week I answer Qs about Christmas and how I keep negativity out: https://t.co/CsHDsj0MLg
#BBN, let's all send out prayers to @ashlyles as she undergoes brain surgery today. Positive thoughts, Ashley!

The original design was by my good friend John Gilmore. Looks great!
I just want to tell you how appreciative I am that UMass would bring back the uniforms from that great time. https://t.co/TargtuFxyF
If you think in terms of a year, it's WIN; if in terms of 10 years, it's the PROGRAM; if in terms of 100 years, it's about the PLAYERS.
Players first. People first. It's our legacy! https://t.co/cOg76XV4ER
Great way to spend some time with family during the holidays. Let's #PackTheHouse, #BBN  https://t.co/LrsE3Ghgje
No one steals the joy of that time!
I was so blessed to be at UMass at an early stage in my career as we built a foundation focused on family, excellence and players first.
It's not about me or individual players - it's about that era. I can't wait to get there.
I'm really proud and honored to being going back to UMass this week as they honor an era.

Thanks again to the great folks at Wagon Bones for providing lunch to the staff today. Love that BBQ and mac ‘n cheese!
#BBN, there's a new Mailbag episode up on staying motivated and our team spending time together as a family. Watch: https://t.co/ct1AJtt1aC
By the way, Merton spent time at St. Bonaventure in New York. I plan on visiting his steps there.
You’ll read about peace, race relations &amp; bringing religions together. All the things we’re dealing with today, he dealt with in the 1960s.
I have visited the monastery a couple times, and if you want to read about an amazing life, Google Thomas Merton.
Learned at Mass this morning that it’s the anniversary of Thomas Merton’s death. Thomas was a monk from Gethsemani near Bardstown, Ky.

You win or you learn. WE LEARNED. Time to get back to work. Time to get better. Let's figure this out!
My good friend Jerry Schilling, he and GK, were two of Elvis' best friend. https://t.co/X3x9IunxKd
LOL, by the way, neither one of us like needles.
There is no doubt in my mind @drose is getting closer and closer to being 100 percent. That spells trouble for the rest of the league.
I can’t imagine Chicago has a player that works harder than @drose. He's grown so much since the first time I saw him play.
I talked to @drose this morning for a while. What a great person. What a great basketball player. What a hard worker.
We're on Pacific Time out here in LA so it's not too late to wish @Goodknight11 a happy birthday. Happy birthday, B-Knight!
Tyler practiced today but was limited. His elbow's still a little tender. He looked OK but he's still day to day. We'll see about tomorrow.
Now time for practice. Time to get better.
Got a chance to catch up with Shannon Sharpe before we left. Looks like he could still play. https://t.co/PodrYNmmy8
Had a good time at the @FS1 studios. Same studio where we shot "The Best Damn Sports Show Period" back in the day https://t.co/gNDrMR4FNa

Ellen also agreed to do the Y for her birthday. She's gone from Mrs. No to  Mrs. Yes, I'll do whatever you ask me. https://t.co/FtsRXErrmo
Appreciate the players taking brownies to Ellen on her bday. That's her gift to every guy who's been in the program https://t.co/gVfpLZhGAj
We're going to hold Tyler out tonight. He'll be fine but want to make sure he's 100 percent before he goes back out there. He wants to play.
I also want to wish Coach Hall and @allisonpeevy1 a happy birthday today. Special day for birthdays.
It's my wife's birthday today!  She's getting better with age. A great wife and great mother to my children and sons!
Congratulations to @UKCoachMitchell on his 200th victory at Kentucky. Getting it done! https://t.co/7Z9Xuyhm33
#BBN, join me in wishing @UKCoachJustus happy bday. Joel has been an unbelievable addition to our staff. Doing great things for our program.
It's @J30_RANDLE's 21st bday. OMG. I'm having red velvet cake in his honor and his mom, Carolyn.

It's Kenny Payne's birthday! Great coach, teacher and mentor with a big heart! Players sang to him on bus!
As a player, as a coach and as an executive, Pat Riley will go down as the best-ever to do all three. https://t.co/nqgLK2jC1B
To a friend, to a mentor, to one of my presenters at the HOF, I thank you. The message Pat Riley gave for our team today was amazing.
After a HOF career, Alonzo Mourning has added to his legacy by making an impact on kids' lives at the @OYCMiami. https://t.co/WFQHQEa0x0
Unbelievable time at the Overtown Youth Center. What a rewarding experience for our guys to be able to give back. https://t.co/bQiaEfzT4n
Hey #BBN, how about @DevinBook getting the start for the @Suns tonight!
Saw Sacha today, saw Wenyen scrimmage last week and Bam play Saturday. Oh, and I've been listening to this album. https://t.co/9MZxDbZ6yi
Sacha was at practice today. It was great to see him again. https://t.co/QYgGjnzR4C

Love you, @MeganteCalipari!
My baby girl's bday. Remember going into practice after leaving hospital &amp; saying there's nothing u can do to make me mad! @MeganteCalipari
Today is Jerry Colangelo's birthday. His accomplishments in our game are unparalleled. A good man whose friendship I appreciate.
They’re all different and they’re all concerned with being the best version of themselves. As we bring this all together, I’m excited.
Every player in this class is different. They all have their own strengths. They all bring something to the table.
This recruiting wasn’t just coming from me and my staff; this whole group wanted to play together &amp; wants to be one of the best groups ever.
One of the things I loved about this group is they all want to play together.
#BBN, welcome our newest group of Wildcats. You are going to love this group! https://t.co/uGp986vBKR https://t.co/XHnkdTltoC
One of the great teammates of all time, @drose. His son is 3. If I'm still coaching in 14 years, that's my PG. https://t.co/jEULduNOy3
.@Goodknight11 with his first career triple-double last night! He and @EBled2 are playing like all-stars for the Suns!
Rob Gilmore, long-time friend. His father, John, and I were like brothers. https://t.co/Pw4zAffH4v
Then I move on with the work at hand. Wouldn't want to know how your son did if you couldn't make it to the game?
If you wonder how I stay up w/ all our NBA guys, first thing I look at every morning is a summary on how our guys did &amp; how their teams did.
109 points and 32 rebounds for @boogiecousins in the last three games. Are you kidding me?! Those are MVP numbers if the Kings keep winning.
.@_JustCharles_ birthday today and also @KarlTowns. No brownies for you, Karl, but in another year you’ll be 21. Happy birthday to both!
So happy Megan Thacker and Chris Rogers could come by shootaround and come to the game tonight. Megan is a fighter! https://t.co/XNCcmd4ifu
#BBN, Isaiah is out for tonight's game with a bruised knee. We hope to get him back for tomorrow.
And so @KarlTowns doesn't pout, I better tell you he had ANOTHER double-double last night! LOL
.@TreyMambaLyles got his first NBA start last night. Yeah! @EBled2 went for 29-10-9 while @Goodknight11 had 37 points. Crazy!
With Ed Allin, who played for Coach Rupp in the 1940s. Wow!!! https://t.co/EhLkCxZrqX
