Grammar error, "writes a letter";). Mistakes=life,character building. Adaptation to change is necessary. DMG=some good, enjoy racing again.
and racing. JRP, u will get huge respect for the change from everyone and alls good w the past. Now let's promote our amazing sport positive
Slept on it and & had this thought. JRP rights a letter to Al(apologizing for the set up) as Al has to JRP already. Be serious on the track
The racing has been great lately, right to the checkered. Thanks to the riders watching for blue flags, appreciated by all. Sorry to ramble
I was his friend & helped him every wkend,knew what he was up to.even Just cares about his reality show. Fine. Then, utube publicity stunt.
The antics have been seen too many times and DMG finally addressed it. He acts so innocent, so why the hidden cameras all the time?
It's a safety issue and many times changes the outcome of the race or the battle to the finish. This would not be allowed in another sport.
Problem is, this is our job and when a guy pulls into the pits and back out in front of the leaders to get tv time it changes the game.
Thanks 4 the Q's on Jrp. Only seeing a few minutes, missing the hour he prodded Al to get a rise for his video. Then playing mr innocent.
The sunset over the continental divide never gets old, always tweaking it's look.  http://yfrog.com/867hbj
Al Ludington is passionate for our sport,concerned for rider safety and the best technical inspector the sport has had. Thanks JRP.
@jjx Yeah I know, but JRP set up a good person probably costing him his job(he has wife&2 kids). Just to gain press anyway he can.
@jjx U made a mistake on the Professional rider list, u included JRP(not professional in any form!) But, Chaz, Lavertys, etc are also on.

Hey, several of us are doing silverman event in November.  Any takers?? http://www.silvermannv.com/
Test at T-Hill was gnarly!  Eyes bleeding from dry 100 deg air.  My balls are too small for that track.  JH and TQ beat me up pretty bad.
@AnastasiaNas I like the way u think;). Now that u mention it, all that standing saved both rims;).
@WickedWahine88 Yes, Jacks snoring is legendary. I actually feel sorry for the campers next us when he sleeps on his back or side.
Like any sport, Jacks competition is always looking to take his title;).  http://yfrog.com/5ins0fj
This is Jack's look 23 hrs a day. A face only a mother could love:-) http://yfrog.com/085kzj
Oh yeah. Double flat w/tubs =$200 buckeroos. Why am I hauling a 18lb travel pack with a sub 14lb bike? Ignoramus!
Double effing flat today! Rode 15 miles to the camper standing up leaning on the bars to save my rim. Lesson=do not run a heavy rear pack;(.
The lesson here is, if your gonna ride on tubbies with 60mm rims...why carry only a 50mm tire? Hm=25miles http://yfrog.com/04c58ij
