The Game will continue the change and morph.. I don’t make the Game. I just try and break it down for you...
FYI: On Spotify an artist makes about .007 cents a play... MFs figured out a way to break down a penny! Cold Jack!
Albums where great because you had to commit to listening to at least one full side of project at a time. The same with cassettes. CDs made it easy to skip.. ITunes allowed you to get ONE song from an Album.... Now here we are... Streaming which is basically pay radio. https://t.co/coyMZc69xw
I honestly would say an EP nowadays...  A few solid songs is always the way to start. Full album once you establish a fan base. Honestly you gotta get a Hot SINGLE to even intrest people in your EP.. One step at a time.... https://t.co/iQ9Wvehk5c

I’ve always looked for an empty lane.. Even when I started Rapping there where less than 20 big artist.. When I started acting there where less that 20 named black actors and less Rappers turned actors.. My Rock band is Unique.. Choose the lane with the least Traffic..
