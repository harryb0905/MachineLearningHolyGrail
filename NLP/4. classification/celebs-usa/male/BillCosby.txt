Now that you’re grown, prove to me that you learned something - pass it on. RT @ilvemy3cats I loved watching the @BillCosby show growing up!
Didn’t intend to do that. Just wanted to make people laugh. I love laughing.  It’s good medicine.  /@kimmiblack1
RT @kimmiblack1: @BillCosby, thank you for your contribution to humanity!
@MikeDiStasio Just tried to get a car in or out of what.  I laughed so hard.
@MikeDiStasio Yeah.  Did you pay attention to Buster Keaton in that film.  Never said a word.
@bfkoontz Thank you.  That’s what we intended to do.  Mom’s and daughters together sharing laughter.
Woww. Let’s start a Brazilian contingency. You’re #2 after Sonia Braga. RT @lhms68 Hi @BillCosby Im your Brazilian admire. Have a nice week!
Chocolate pudding! :)  #OBKB RT @NitroHotFire: Hey @BillCosby, what's your favorite flavor of Jell-O?
Maybe you needed that additional 10yrs of maturity. Are you a parent now? Or what? RT @johnrozier GHOST DAD is on! Classic @BillCosby movie!
Yes, thank you thank you thank you. Sidney Poitier did a wonderful job. RT @reneeburchett: Just watched Ghost Dad on GMC, I love that movie!
@Antebellumgal Yeah, that is a big problem. Especially when you aren’t looking & you feel it in your ear.

@theweeshow who didn’t twitter when you tweeted.  That’s not how I tweat people.  If I didn’t tweet, then I hit the wrong button.  #OBKB!
I am. And I love it when I look at Mrs. Cosby & see that she is younger than I. RT @AshliMarie_: @BillCosby should be forever young!
I think we have some ringtones... http://t.co/Lp0V4rE RT @spencersteele1 I find myself wanting to have the voice of @BillCosby more & more!
@theweeshow It is not funny for families of drunks.
@theweeshow Back then, drunks viewed as funny people.  We now know it is an illness.  Alcohol does change how people think.
@TriniTwin2 Not really. That’s what’s kept me in the charts. There are great similarities regardless of year of birth, race, gender or creed
@IanGertler I don’t think so.  I don’t know how old you are.  You better watch out for your pancreas and gall bladder.
Words like this, make us feel very very wonderful.  Thank you. RT @kalaiimckenna: @BillCosby family, love & respect... PRICELESS TREASURES!
@5uperman_ Mrs. Cosby still does not find that routine funny.  She lives and relives it as if that just happened.  She’s mean to me.
Listen, you’re busy & cannot be everywhere. I forgive you. RT @urbanpar: Why didn't I know my mentor in a sweater, @BillCosby is on Twitter?
@Beresh Thank you.  And I think that is one of the great words along with commitment.
How about fixing the rabbit ears? ;) RT @JWynt_1: I've watched & learned from you since I could pull the knob on our b/w 15inch. Thank You!

Yes, however, have you got the facial expressions down? RT @thenewjulie I can lipsync "night time is the right time" like nobody's business!
@starfoxblog We’re going have to find a place to hide.  Mrs. Cosby is coming to snatch those hoagies.
Well, I don’t recall the “ain’t”.  Yupppp. RT @awesomeness_jen: "A word to the wise ain't necessary, it's the stupid ones who need advice."
@The_Shley  It’s “SD” for Sammy Davis.  He had passed away.
She was very hip.  She drove a Corvette all around Brooklyn & Harlem. RT @SouthStanderRSM: Sorry about the passing of your "TV mom".

To see the rest of my statement, visit my Facebook page.
I agree with President Carter that racism is playing a role in recent outbursts against President Obama.
For some people, this president will always be damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.
The people who hold up the signs, "Give me back my country," should put down their signs and learn something about our country.
This has been falsely attributed to me.
I did not write or have anything to do with the "Bill Cosby's Platform" circulating on the Internet.
My comments yesterday were specifically written to address the Write-in for President Platform, which is a hoax.
False Bill Cosby statements are not funny nor fun and sometimes mean-spirited.
Whatever I say is on my Twitter, Facebook or billcosby.com.
How much is eight times $75?
Just a plain old, raggedy, $75-an-hour electrician.
Not every student wants to be a doctor or lawyer. What about a physical therapist or an electrician?
We’ve got to speak to parents--in a way they can understand--that the prison system is smiling, waiting for your child, the dropout.
Mrs. X:  "They are repairing the roads to make jobs for the unemployed thereby making the employed late for their jobs."
Mr. Cosby to Mrs. X:  "Why are you late for work this morning?"
I'm not only speaking about a leader to fill his Senate seat, but a leader who has the same commitment, activism, and service to the public.
The void left by his passing must be filled carefully, thoughtfully and most importantly with integrity.
Ted Kennedy set the tone for the people defined by what he has done.
Dr. Poussaint also says to read to your children daily.
Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. says to give your child a hug today.
Why would we want to take money from a success story and pull back on it so that they can enter prison?
It takes less than $5,000 a year to educate a young person, but $33,000 a year to incarcerate someone.
No more cuts for Penn's students.  They're moving on a course that is very favorable.
Always end the name of your child with a vowel, so that when you yell, the name will carry.
Montreal Gazette Review, Tireless Cosby shows how it's done: http://bit.ly/Z48oy
Hello.  Hello.  Can we get back to health care reform?  Thank you.
Race relations in this United States of America needs a huge dose of honesty and tolerance.  Thank you.
My response is the following: I wasn’t there.
I have been asked by several journalists to comment on the situation between Officer Crowley and Professor Gates.
So I tell them I'm going to work--with 6000 of my closest friends.
I think about retirement until I'm at home and nobody wants to listen to me.
African Americans have no excuse to get bad grades or cut class, there is no 21st workforce if we all aren't educated.
Michelle Bernard, Stephen A. Smith and Chris Matthews on Hardball on Obama's NAACP speech:
If you want more Bill Cosby, just fly over and land at my official website, www.billcosby.com!
We've got to get our people to believe in themselves again, to value themselves and stop waiting for Jesse Jackson & Al Sharpton to fix it.
If something bad is happening in the community, why do we just keep on talking about it?
Our children deserve better.
In the name of God, or anyone else you believe in, 420 students need more than one counselor.
We've got to get people into the system who want to teach.  We need principals who want to train teachers.
I also said at the Essence Music Festival that our children need us.
If this is true, with school starting in September, then there would be no one left to teach by July.
At the Essence Music Festival on July 4, I was informed that 7000 children drop out of school per day.
Have a tweet time and I will write tweet nothings in your ear.
I have now officially joined the world of Twittering.  To read my tweets come here!  Any Bill Cosby tweet elsewhere is not my Twitter.
