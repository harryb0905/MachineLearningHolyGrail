The #NFL commissioner selects the members of the Competition Committee, which currently consists of owners, presidents, general managers and head coaches. Needs some ex players away from the game on there too. Starting with me!
Will the #NFL refs be fined/suspended for bad officiating? 🤔

@BillyFletch @hawks_bears Trump owned and dominated the narrative then completely stopped. The media covered it as they should since it was a “crisis”. The bottom line was that it wasn’t a caravan crisis where tons of people were coming in. That’s just simply not true.
@BillyFletch @hawks_bears Media narrative? Lol. The president was tweeting about the “crisis” non stop before midterms and then literally stopped. Tijuana has always been a city of migrants. No one is just getting across.
@BillyFletch @hawks_bears It was “the biggest crisis facing Americans” then it went silent! Please explain.
@BillyFletch @hawks_bears Billy - Focus! I said what happened to the original big caravan??

@mickflipdigets Defenders don't have to pull up. I can whip right past you without making contact. That's not a foul.
@mickflipdigets Yes there is something else. He didn't hit him! There was Incidental contact made from his feet because he avoided hitting him.
Kiko Alonso comes in hot at a QB slidding late, misses hitting him, gets ejected and everyone calls him a scumbag 🤷🏾‍♂️ #NFL

@VMayz @hardknocks916 The game we were bread to play has changed. There are rules in place that has changed the style of play. That is very simple see. My main issue is player safety. If it's truly an area of concern then protect all players! The NFL fails at that.
"Only if the DB would turn around". Like it's just so simple defending a guy that you can't touch and putting yourself in position to look back at a ball that's not thrown to you. So simple. #MNF
The automatic 1st down on defensive holding is something the league needs to get rid of. #MNFxESPN
@CamWorrell there is no way that tweet is real. Nope. I don’t believe it. Nope. https://t.co/8hyJss30F2

Pretty good #MNF game going on right now.
@GodPackers I would say they favor and care more about the safety of offensive players than defensive
@bystanderone He was in a defenseless posture by rule and received an unnecessary forcible hit to the head/neck area. Welcome to the new NFL.
@AlecYanke Exactly right. Unnecessary and that’s why the flags came out.
@evetSAnderson 2 things. Player is in a defenseless posture by rule (similar to a wr trying to make a catch). 2 Forcible and unnecessary contact to the head and neck area. In todays NFL it is an illegal hit that’s why every ref threw their flag.
I hope you are enjoying your Victory Monday!! #BearDown
@KenMaren @PackerReport I read that too. Yes the player was in defenseless posture with what you just described and yes unnecessary forceful contact to the neck area was made. Dude left the game with a head injury. The flag was correct.
@KenMaren @PackerReport Ken I didn’t write the rule but I’m telling you what it is! That hit is illegal in today’s NFL. Kind of like the BS body weight rule. It is what it is.
@KenMaren @PackerReport I understand your point but it’s the new NFL and different game. The new word Defenseless goes both ways. Offense and Defense. The kill shot has been taken out the game.
Well damn, this didn't age well! https://t.co/LH2qhkD21d

@ChiBearBearDown 3. Every illegal blindside block I’ve seen resulted in the defender leaving the game. It’s a very dangerous hit. This isn’t the old NFL.
@ChiBearBearDown 1. He is a defenseless defender. 2. If the initial force of the contact by a blocker's helmet, forearm, or shoulder is to the head or neck area of an opponent when the blocker is moving toward his own endline and approaches his opponent from behind or from the side.
Lol!! https://t.co/CbRvVrgggA
@ChiBearBearDown So that’s your answer? Why did every ref at that stadium throw a flag?
@ChiBearBearDown In the NFL of new, please tell me what was clean about that hit?
Glad to see him walk off after that vicious hit. Get well sir. https://t.co/ILXG1yoDGC

@olin_kreutz I could have sworn Butler was Hawaiian too. No? Lol
Illegal use of the hands (hands to the face) on the defense but a stiff arm to the face is perfectly legal. Player safety is what the league is preaching 🤷🏾‍♂️ #MNF #NFL
The BS call was made. Then the officials huddled up and talked about the BS. And then they all agreed to let that BS stand! What a shame! #MNF
Mariota is 6’4 225 and gets more contact protection than 5’11 180 Malcom Butler in a full contact sport. #NFL #MNF
QBs have to slide and give themselves up way earlier. This is getting way out of control!!! Dude did everything possible to avoid contact while running full speed at his target. Terrible!!! #NFL #MNF
It’s Victory Monday!! Go treat yo’self today!! 🐻⬇️

Rushed home from a bday dinner to see #TNF . Sees score!! Now rushing back to the bday dinner!!
@CamWorrell Cheers Good Sir. Keep up the Great Work!!
@CamWorrell You are correct. To add to that point the top tier power ranked teams run the ball effectively in the red zone for TDs.
@CamWorrell I can see your point. I think the value of a stud running back and a strong running attack is coming back fast. Check the top teams on the power rankings.
@AngiTaylorKISS @KINDSnacks @JasonPrinzo The obvious thing to do next would be for all of us to star as @KINDSnacks wrapper crunchers in the next commercial/campaign! 😎
@CamWorrell Rule number one. Stop the run.
@tedgruber I just have a problem accepting throwing at a batter deliberately to hit him in retaliation. To me, that's Bush Leauge.
@tedgruber I hear you but if Aguilar moves his foot off the bag which I've seen so many 1st basemen do in the playoffs we wouldn't be talking about it. Whats really bush league to me is how many are expecting a fastball to be thrown at Machados head.
@tedgruber Interesting. I would think you would want to get your foot off the bag quickly after an out to avoid any situation in which you could get clipped.
@tedgruber So you just left your foot on the bag for an extended period of time after the runner was thrown out?
Is it not taught that a 1st baseman should move his foot quickly off the bag after a runner gets thrown out at 1st? Asking for a friend.
This!!!!! https://t.co/SAVuezqL7l
Bigger. Stronger. Faster WRs and you can’t put a finger on them after 5 yards. Add that to all the other new rules against the defense. #DeathOfDefense #NFL https://t.co/8ESL31lWm8

Defender was taken out the game after that hit. Player safety?? Not when it comes to defensive players! Shame on you #NFL https://t.co/z02f4Gyf3W

@PatrickMahomes5 is pretty damn good!
@CamWorrell Literally asked Twitter about this earlier!! @NFLOfficiating @nflcommish @nfl can you please explain?? https://t.co/z86DiPz7Jl
I was always told that if you can’t stop the run you can’t win!! #MNF
@Steven_Thelen Agreed!!
Running backs are not part of the new #NFL rule that says that players cannot lower their heads to initiate and make contact with opponents correct? ie. Hunt #AFAF

@olin_kreutz Would like to see the @nflcommish suit up and demonstrate on video at full speed the proper way to hit. Or lay off a hit.
So laying off the QB is now roughing the passer too? Wowowowow!!! #NFL #MNF
But hands to the face is a penalty in the #NFL except..... #MNF
Ugh Chris Conte!! #MNF
Overheard: Jimmy G blew his knee out while getting chased by defenders? Bet the #NFL will make a new rule for next season outlawing chasing QBs.

#Bears Defense making plays. 🐻⬇️
The whole referee helping the QB off the ground bothers me! #NFL
Never understood the hands to the face penalty? Is it called for player safety? If so what about a stiff arm? How is that not called hands to the face??? I need answers #NFL

Someone asked me who I would give the #NFL MVP to after the first game. This is very very simple for me. #MACK #ChicagoBears !!
#NeverForget
Illegal by definition. But it’s the offense so....... https://t.co/H0rEIfiFqB
@dsanderson1976 Exactly which leads me to believe that the league isn’t really concerned with “player safety”.
Cook lowers his head and strikes the defender in the head and neck area with the crown of his helmet. Thought they were trying to get that out of football? 🤔
It annoys me when announcers say “all the DB has to do is turn around” as if it is that simple! 🙄.
Overheard: After all these damn years Oakland still hasn’t figured out how to grass up the baseball diamond for football games? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Pure Gold!! 😂 https://t.co/SPQQNdYm6E
These unnecessary roughness calls are getting out of hand. Too much emphasis on defensive players changing they way they play but never the offense.
😂 https://t.co/V1wvbbW0DZ
Look at those #Jets #NFL
Im impressed with how the #Jets have responded after Darnold's first throw! #NFL
Im still not sure what a catch is in the #NFL
I was feeling bad about the #Bears loss last night. Im just glad im not feeling like Darnold on his very first NFL throw / pic 6. Welcome to the #NFL on Monday Night!!

@CoreyWootton Defensive players need to be Vocal about these hitting rules and being fined outrageous amounts. Don’t leave it all up to the league office.
Totally understand Nagys decision to sit his starters. Longest preseason ever!! #Bears
@greggabe The league didn’t get that guy during the week. Everyone saw it and everyone missed it. This is why I say the league isn’t interested in truly making this game safer. No accountability on the offensive end.
Defensive players are the only ones that get these insane fine amounts. Band together and speak up!! Or just continue to pay those crazy fines. https://t.co/1znxGtyfYx
