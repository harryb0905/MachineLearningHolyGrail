10 (last one) / #Woodward notes after he said similar on @FoxNewsSunday Jan 15 2017 @realDonaldTrump tweeted re #dossier ‚Äî ‚ÄúThank you to Bob Woodward who said, ‚ÄòThat is a garbage document ... it never should have been presented‚Äù (same Woodward WH now trying to discredit)
9/ #Woodward writes ‚Äú..as if I had reported &amp; written one of the most serious, complex stories for WashPost that I had ever done ‚Äî and then provided an appendix of unverified allegations. Oh, by the way, here is a to-do list for further reporting and we‚Äôre publishing it‚Äù @comey
8/ #Woodward ‚Äî ‚Äú..dossier is the sort of stuff that a reporter or the FBI might more than reasonably follow up on.. But including it, even in scaled-down form, in one of the most important briefings the intel chiefs might ever present to a president-elect made little sense to me‚Äù
7/ #Woodward ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey wanted the formal assessment to be believed by the president-elect. Why pollute it w the dossier summary? They knew enough about Trump to know it would rile him up .. would have riled anyone up. Why would they accompany their most serious work‚Äù w dossier
6/ #Woodward credits intel chiefs for important report on meddling but goes in on @Comey again: ‚ÄúAnd then, almost as an afterthought, Comey had introduced the dossier as if to say, btw, here is this scurrilous, unverified, unsupported footnote w some of the ugliest allegations‚Äù
5/ Then interestingly #Woodward takes @Comey to task for adding sellacious #dossier material to Jan 6 brief: ‚ÄúI was surprised, not at the allegations, which might be true, but that the intelligence chiefs, particularly the FBI director, would present any of this to Trump.‚Äù
4/ #WoodwardBook adds new nugget: ‚ÄúThis has also not been previously reported: The CIA believed they had at least six human sources supporting this finding [on meddling]. One person w access to the full top secret report later told me he believed that only two were solid‚Äù
3/ #WoodwardBook adds of #clapper brief Trump Tower Jan62017: Trump ‚Äúa ‚Äòclear preference‚Äô [of Russia] &amp; the effort was aimed very much at ‚Äòdiscrediting‚Äô &amp; ‚Äòundermining‚Äô Clinton. There was no suggestion that Trump or his associates had colluded or coordinated w the Russian effort‚Äù
2/ #WoodwardBook adds despite dossier being potentially suspect @JohnBrennan ‚Äúsaid the information was in line with their own sources [at CIA], in which he had great confidence‚Äù
1/ re #WoodwardBook if WH reads they‚Äôll see #Woodward actually raises sharp Q‚Äôs about #dossier ‚Äî reports ‚Äúthe sources that Steele used for his dossier had not been polygraphed, which made their information uncorroborated, and potentially suspect‚Äù

Sort of the point Brit originally made -- his own Sec of State gave a diplomatic or non-committal answer https://t.co/cT8dE1QHPZ
Imagine that -- a viewer who independently listens to the words spoken w no political filter https://t.co/mStqkORtPK
Right. Sec of State doesnt defend the President after a straight Q on a news program -- and that's creating drama. https://t.co/iCOBBkMB2u
Right. A direct quote is "out of context" -- check tape ans full context and get back to me. Thanks https://t.co/zgS8N3VoS2
Sec of State could say the President speaks for him bc they share the same values? https://t.co/oZbBzxfwqw
But it was the President who PICKED the Sec of State? ... https://t.co/cmQffE4XrV
You mean quoting the President's own Sec of State? Check facts get back to me. https://t.co/OEJPQ3Ngrq

Gorka told me he called Gen. Kelly today to say resigning &amp; wanted to come to office Mon to give letter to POTUS -- Kelly basically said no
Sebastian Gorka called to say in terms of his vacation, Gen. Kelly "never mentioned it for a millisecond" in call
Vacation https://t.co/NuwtJNLSI8
Gorka tells me "liberating" to resign; others say was fired. I'm told exit after VERY tense call where Gen Kelly pressed him re long vaca

Cavs by a mile https://t.co/6obwqrIAxu
right. i gave the President credit for admitting he had changed his mind, but oddly some of his allies can't admit he flip flopped. https://t.co/Z0oPzedw2N
He repeatedly said during campaign he'd pull out of Afghanistan -- you probably just missed that https://t.co/5NimayU4TS

I hear ya. and I know what he said. but you don't think parents sending kids to war don't deserve more details about how this will change? https://t.co/8b2z2CTa4x
grown up response. so what is the clear mission? https://t.co/hsnPrLmBHk
Obama in '09 said Pakistan army "has gone on its largest offensive"; President Trump holding them accountable. More 11pm ET @TheFive
I mean the President said there is a "clear mission" -- but not detailing to American people what that is https://t.co/kj0XAOrGSU
President showed leadership by admitting he was flip-flopping on promise, now wants "honorable" end -- but not explaining "clear mission"
President Obama started '09 speech saying he wanted to discuss "our effort" in Afghanistan"; President Trump talks of "winning" but how?
Hopefully you will reflect on the lives lost in #Afghanistan and adjust tweet. https://t.co/FkZ0rttibR
President talks of giving the military the tools to "fight and win" #Afghanistan
President opens w attempt to "heal" nation:"When one part of America hurts, we all hurt .. one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer"

WH talking points end w/leaders ‚Äúshould join the president in trying to unite and heal our country rather than incite more division‚Äù
More WH talking points: President a ‚Äúvoice for unity and calm‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúcondemned ‚Äì with no ambiguity ‚Äì the hate groups fueled by bigotry"
WH circulating talking points that say President ‚Äúentirely correct ‚Äì both sides of the violence in Charlottesville acted inappropriately‚Äù
