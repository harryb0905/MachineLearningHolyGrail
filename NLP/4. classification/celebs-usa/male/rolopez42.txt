Selma is a great flick. Unless you're related to Lyndon B. Johnson.

@AminESPN @NiBeau79 haha. I did love Dances With Wolves so I guess he has a point......
@AminESPN @NiBeau79 I'm sure that's exactly what happened too
I think it's endearing how he switches between accents in Robin Hood "@NiBeau79: @rolopez42 I notice you didn't include Costner...,"
Really does steal any scene he's in. But so does Sean... "@RyanLounsbury: @rolopez42 the only answer in any movie with DeNiro is DeNiro"

Been jamming to some #Disney music at the apartment...is Poor Unfortunate Souls the best villain song or just the best song? Discuss.
p.s. please cut down or improve upon on the graphics in your otherwise fine periodical @USATODAYsports   Thank you,  @rolopez42
For comparison's sake @USATODAYsports , I provide you with an example of "Steamrolling": http://t.co/9UtkkYHXvv
Dear @USATODAYsports  While being a ferocious dunk, not sure "Steamrolled" is an apt description, as it implies contact. Perhaps "Evaded."
