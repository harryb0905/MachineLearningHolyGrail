We're holding a #JohnnySánchez Job Fair on Thursday for NOLA! Spread the word plz! https://t.co/eQISYZgpG2
Loved meeting both owners - passionate people. We made decision based on flavor + growth potential. Thx for watching y'all! #HungryInvestors
Decision time - who do you think deserves our investment? #HungryInvestors
You have to be able to turn tables to increase business. If Jay + Lloyd can figure it out they could have a great business. #HungryInvestors
@spiketv Nope… I'm married! ;)
“@Nanc723: @chefjohnbesh Yup.  Even a home kitchen!” For sure!
To be a successful operator you have to understand your #'s.  It takes way more than just making great food! #HungryInvestors
Cleanliness is crucial to the success of any kitchen! #HungryInvestors
Our first invest test at Hero King is going pretty smooth so far - can they keep up the quality? #hungryinvestors
No bread = no bueno! Hopefully Hero King can bring it for the Invest Test. #HungryInvestors
Next up: Hero King in Newark, a business that's been voted the best hero in Newark in the past, does the honor still stand? #HungryInvestors
Now this is some pastrami - we could have something to work with here. That's why I come to a Jewish deli! #hungryinvestors
First up - Jay and Lloyd's Kosher Deli in Brooklyn. These guys are such characters. Let's see how good their pastrami is. #hungryinvestors

This was one of the toughest decisions yet. Both Serio's (Mike/Mickey) + Juneau's (Nina/Chad) represented NOLA well! #HungryInvestors
Final decision time on #hungryinvestors! Who do you think deserves it?
@melnola11 Thanks for the kind words and support!
Invest Test - you're up, Juneau's, with some new equipment and recipe help from @masterchefTD. I believe in Nina &amp; Chad! #HungryInvestors
Time for the Invest Test at Serio's. We added the new Mickey sandwich, a new bar - let's see how it goes! #HungryInvestors
That Mickey po'boy with roasted pork is crazy good y'all!! #HungryInvestors
A great batter is the key to tasty fried foods! #HungryInvestors
“@goatheadjp: I'd have to say Juneau's. My parents ate there as kids, been going my whole life. Love Nina &amp; Chad” Wonderful people!!
@melnola11 That's a good one for sure!
@cdenise21 Yeah you right!
Who do you think deserves our investment so far? It's basically great location vs. great food at this point. #HungryInvestors
“@SuperAmazingDad: @SpikeTV @chefjohnbesh I don't like any seafood. What kind of po'boy would you recommend for me?” Roast Beef for sure!
Off to our next spot - Juneau's. We're encountering issues herewith food costs - the key to managing a restaurant budget. #HungryInvestors
Our orders are in at Serio's and we're ready to eat. That bar might be the smallest one in New Orleans! #HungryInvestors
The po' boy was invented in 1929 - have you had one? What's your favorite?? #hungryinvestors
On tonights episode of #HungryInvestors we're back in my hometown of New Orleans + looking for a great po' boy shop... 9/8c on @SpikeTV.
@gaskinbiz Thanks brother!  Appreciate you watching!
“@vegasjey: @jontaffer @chefjohnbesh Just discovered #HungryInvestors on @HuluPlus I'm watching every episode available non-stop😂!” Love it!
Fired up to open #JohnnySánchez tonight @HorseshoeBmore with my friend and partner @Chef_Aaron. http://t.co/tCv7xzsPNi
Tough to choose when nice, passionate people are involved. Was rooting for both owners, but had to go with most potential. #HungryInvestors
@president_jl @jontaffer @mastercheftd Thanks for watching!
@literateartist It varies each episode… really depends on how close it is btw the owners/restaurants. Sometimes hours. #HungryInvestors
“@mmacesich: @chefjohnbesh I just know I wanna eat #PizzaLino's pie. #HungryInvestors” Amen brother!
Decision time - who do you think has shown the most promise and deserves our investment? #HungryInvestors
That pork from Emily's Pork Store in Brooklyn was awesome! Always best to buy local! #HungryInvestors
Time for the next invest test @evilolivebar. We're working with higher quality ingredients, which means a higher check. #HungryInvestors
Invest test #1! We're putting this World Champion Pizza Tosser on display! And…the competition is here! #hungryinvestors
Pizza tossing is a skill, but it takes way more than that to be successful. Thankfully Joe also makes a great pie! #HungryInvestors
@literateartist @jontaffer @mastercheftd No doubt!
@kylecelt33 It's been a while, but there are some great pies and slices up there for sure! #HungryInvestors
@tlynn629 They def can and that's what we're going to try and help them do! #HungryInvestors
We're at Pizzalino's in Bayonne, a neighborhood joint. Talk about pizza showmanship! But the numbers here do not bode well. #hungryinvestors
“@jontaffer: @chefjohnbesh @AlonShaya Domenca is the best I've ever had John!” Thx brother!
My partner @jontaffer has good taste in pizza! We're proud of our pies at Domenca! @AlonShaya
Tonight's episode of #hungryinvestors starts now. My partners + I are looking for a pizza joint to invest. @jontaffer @MasterChefTD @SpikeTV

I had so much fun hosting @MasterChefTD &amp; @jontaffer in my home town. Proud of both owners and how they represented #NOLA. #HungryInvestors
“@MVPenergy: @chefjohnbesh I prefer the quail and margaritas at Luke #SanAntonio #nomnom” Cant be mad at that!
So who do you think deserves our investment?  Neyow's or Orleans Bistro?  #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
@chef_st @jontaffer is one of my best friends, but our passions come through when deciding on who to invest in. This is a serious decision.
@brianburns77 Thx brother!
Was great to bring the chefs down to Borgne to learn a little from my partner and seafood maestro @chefbrianlandry #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
Shucking oysters is tough, but once you get the hang of it you can crank em out. At Lüke we shuck almost 2000 a day! #HungryInvestors
Making a great roux is the heart of most New Orleans kitchens! #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
That's the NOLA spirit to get that kitchen clean and ready to go. Owner's of Neyow's clearly want it. @SpikeTV #HungryInvestors
@erikawithak1971 @mastercheftd Who dat!
@darrelleclark yeah you right!
@dukeblucamcrazi @mastercheftd @jontaffer Appreciate you!
@las177 @jontaffer @mastercheftd Thx for watching!
@tlynn629 Well thank you.
1 of the things that makes New Orleans so special is everybody's got their favorite version of the classic dishes @SpikeTV #HungryInvestors
“@Chef_Aaron: 5 mins until new episode of #HungryInvestors - @chefjohnbesh + co hit New Orleans. #WhoDat @SpikeTV” Yeah you right!
“@andrewzimmern: Hey world: DONT MISS Hungry Investors @ 9/8c tonight on @SpikeTV @chefjohnbesh new show is GREAT.” Thanks brother!!!
@Narf442 that looks awesome! Great job &amp; good call on the newspaper.
In next week's episode on @SpikeTV, @jontaffer, @MasterChefTD &amp; I head to my hometown! Can't wait. #NOLA #HungryInvestors
If you were in the boardroom with @MasterChefTD and @jontaffer, who would you chose? #HungryInvestors
Communication is absolutely essential in kitchens and, for that matter, in everything we do, right @MasterChefTD? #HungryInvestors
I think @MasterChefTD liked the changes to the cheeseburger! What's your favorite way to cook a burger? #HungryInvestors
We're back on @SpikeTV! If you had to chose a restaurant to invest in right now, which one would you chose? #HungryInvestors

@mommaoftaylor @spiketv Thanks Renee!
I've got to give Paul credit… He handled our critiques well and showed his humble side after a rocky start. #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
I love cooking sous vide. It's the perfect technique for busy kitchens that require heavy prep. #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
@killerkekevin @spiketv Thanks brother.
“@MasterChefTD: Here comes Dr. Besh @chefjohnbesh @SpikeTV #HungryInvestors!” Yeah you right.
@tlynn629 @spiketv Haa… No ma'am.
Well that escalated quickly. Incredible he would lose it like that when he's asking us to invest in his business. #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
Here we go… #HungryInvestors Vegas starting now!  @SpikeTV @jontaffer @MasterChefTD
@mastercheftd Yeah you right… Love you Tiff!
@tlynn629 @spiketv It took some patience and deep breaths to deal with this cat.
@999ben23 @spiketv Thx brother.
@bigbadchef @erccompanies Haaa!  JC!
.@cazcaric @jontaffer @SpikeTV Thanks for watching.  Let us know what you think of tonight's episode.
@mattywill5774 @mastercheftd Always.  It's all love.
Tonight we encounter a Vegas owner w/ anger issues. Watch him get in my face here: http://t.co/Zx7bCSeSb0. #HungryInvestors 9/8c @SpikeTV
Congrats to our next @chefsmove recipients Susana and Ronald! I can't wait to see what you do! http://t.co/TvAHoYEw9X
“@LucasDay2: By far the best #hungryinvestors yet @chefjohnbesh” Thx brother. It was an interesting few days for sure.
“@MasterChefTD: Haha my people Mr. Besh!!!:-) your crazy!! @chefjohnbesh #HungryInvestors” Those WERE your people... Until they bailed! ;)
“@mattywill5774: @jontaffer @chefjohnbesh @MasterChefTD @SpikeTV man what done happened now” It was one thing after another this episode!
@RealRyanFisher @jontaffer @MasterChefTD Thx Ryan!
Miss Tiffany showed em how to make a proper teriyaki. Question is can these guys execute it once the restaurant gets busy? #HungryInvestors
“@NotFakeRichardH: Not a good first impression by either place. #HungryInvestors @jontaffer @chefjohnbesh @MasterChefTD @SpikeTV” Nope!
@Kev_is_410 @MasterChefTD You said it.
@FarmhouseChic Mortified is an understatement. We were close to walking out right then. #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
Needless to say chefs @ Mr. Sushi made a bad 1st impression. Shame because the food was tasty. Can they redeem themselves? #HungryInvestors
We're looking for a sushi restaurant to invest in. One of the chefs indulges in too much sake + hurts his owners chances. #HungryInvestors
@ceciortigosa Thx Cecilia!
“@NinjaNole: Looking forward to new episode of #HungryInvestors 2nite! @jontaffer @chefjohnbesh @MasterChefTD @SpikeTV” Starting in 5 mins!
“@getfitwithwendy: @chefjohnbesh getting ready for a new episode of #HungryInvestors! Sake to me!!!” Thx for watching! @SpikeTV

@strock_bobbie @MasterChefTD @jontaffer @SpikeTV Thx for watching!
@mattywill5774 @strock_bobbie @MasterChefTD @jontaffer Didn't give up... Charlie won.
@icenycbx @MasterChefTD @jontaffer Charlie stepped up big time. The Invest Tests are tough and are meant to push the owners to the limit.
“@DJBuckhalter: @SpikeTV Hell yes. @chefjohnbesh @MasterChefTD and @jontaffer made the right choice. #TAMALEMAN!!” Charlie def deserved it!
Love Sky's passion, but her kitchen totally fell apart during the Invest Test. #HungryInvestors @jontaffer @MasterChefTD @SpikeTV
The tamales at Tamale Man were truly some of the best I've ever had. Rest of the food didn't match up. #HungryInvestors
@subydooby Thanks so much!!!  Hope you enjoy them both!!
New episode of #HungryInvestors starting now - heres a behind the scenes pic of my partners @jontaffer  @MasterChefTD http://t.co/DQm4GHOUtx
Always fun hanging with my co-star + partner in #HungryInvestors Miss Tiffany Derry @MasterChefTD @SpikeTV http://t.co/vHampCApHl
“@dgonfox13: @chefjohnbesh Love this place. 3 times in 3 days. Chocolate dipped beignets #AWESOME http://t.co/qNKoDMFsE6” We appreciate it!!
Tonight we decide btw a Tamale and Taco joint... Which of these traditional Mexican foods do u prefer? #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV @jontaffer
“@mattywill5774: @SpikeTV @jontaffer @chefjohnbesh the show ain't bad. The show ain't bad. The show ain't bad.but the beef was” Nice!
@mcbride1976 @PecheNOLA @cochonbutcher @AtchafalayaFood @herbsaintdining @CochonDining looks like you done good!!

@MadmanPro210 Lüke on Houston &amp; the River.
@tlynn629 @jontaffer respect and friendship and a love for helping people!
@jontaffer @dtonzojr Friends/partners can/should have healthy debates + consider each other's opinions when making important decisions.
@jesus__moreno1 @jontaffer @dtonzojr Thanks Jesus!
@Bill_Finn @chefspike tough when this is one week crammed into 40 minute or so. Both had issues but only one was all about their guests.
@Bill_Finn @chefspike not with an owner who wasn't about his clients... Big up hill battle!
@speedyatups @SpikeTV you'd be surprised at what we find everyday, sometimes a wake up call is needed and in this case they fixed it fast!
@chefspike @dtonzojr Ha, it's all in the editing.. Both were great! But Hawkins showed a willingness to adapt &amp; improve! I do love both!
@Bill_Finn @dtonzojr @chefspike NO, both great burgers but only one with 70 yrs of make guests happy type of experience behind them.
@dtonzojr @jontaffer we love each other, however we come to our decisions from two completely different ways!
Cynthia deserved it. Love her passion and willingness to make the changes necessary to run a successful business. #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
@dtonzojr @chefspike but Hawkins &amp; 70 yrs of history make it a cornerstone in its community!! I love people who love people!
So who do you think deserves our investment… Hawkins or Outlaws? #HungryInvestors @chefspike
@wikiwiki2 Thanks Will. Having systems in place are crucial to every kitchen's success. #HungryInvestors
@Ken_Laas @jontaffer @MasterChefTD that's a Taffer classic!
What type of burger do you like... thick or thin patty? #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
“@MasterChefTD: U gotta be large and in charge -@chefjohnbesh” Yeah you right Miss Tiffany!
@anon99percenter we are investing in people as much as a restaurant!
@Top2Chef @SpikeTV @jontaffer @MasterChefTD too many!!! It's crazy

“@DenaeDArcy: @chefjohnbesh Your mother's gumbo recipe - fantastic!Love your show on @CreateTVchannel.” Thx for watching! We love making it!
@MsTrixieDelight how special!!!
“@AugieTNB: @SpikeTV @jontaffer @chefjohnbesh @MasterChefTD Dead serious, the show is outstanding!!! Love it! #HungryInvestors” Thx brother!
Morris can cook + understands importance of using great ingredients. Just needed to be re-energized + be more contemporary. #HungryInvestors
For the record... Rena is an awesome person + the prime rib at Mac's is crazy good! #HungryInvestors
So now that each owner made their pitch, who do you think we should invest in... Rena or Morris? #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
“@EdoEiv10: @anguzza @chefjohnbesh @Joeym1216 pretty sure this is common knowledge, right?” you'd think so, but not everyone knows.
Always (generously) season your steaks before they go on the grill... and use high heat to create a nice crust. #HungryInvestors @SpikeTV
“@SpikeTV: Don't forget, #HungryInvestors is coming up next. Be sure to set your DVR.” here we go!!

Fun night watching #HungryInvesters premiere with @MasterChefTD, friends + family @spiketv http://t.co/Gq8h6sEs8m
@Lizardonlyqueen @SpikeTV we pick restaurants for different reasons. I was clearly pushing for Billy. Please keep watching, we get it right.
Hope you'll tune in again next week - Sunday 10pm ET on @spiketv #HungryInvestors
“@Jadzia3: Made a point of going to August when I was in NOLA &amp; the food was even better than my (very high) expectations. Yum!” Thx y'all!
Things getting heated at the table!!! Almost decision time. #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
Down to our final meeting. Have Bllly and Clarence convinced you? Who do you think should win the investment?  #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
Do you think Billy made it?? #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
This bbq pit @oakacresbbq is seriously a shrine!! Truly the best pork butt ever. Craving it again right now!!  #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
Now its time to really jump into action, looking forward to working w Billy in the kitchen + helping him work on efficiency #hungryinvestors
The people have spoken, looks like Clarence might change his "the beef is not bad" tune! He's opening up to some advice. #hungryinvestors
Time for the first invest test. Cmon Clarence &amp; Billy! Clarence, the personality, vs Billy, the bbq master. #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
“@th3urgy: @chefjohnbesh riskiest investment that paid off the biggest?” My first restaurant, August.
“@TomMattaBigBand: @chefjohnbesh Chef, any of your restos get deep into BBQ?” We mix it in at some of them for sure. Cochon de Lait y'all!
“@abam0116: @SpikeTV Does location take preference during selection?” It def factors in to our decision, but its so does the food + owner.
“@jesus__moreno1: @chefjohnbesh which brisket did you like better #HungryInvestors” Billy's for sure.
The kitchen is slammed - I've had nights like this on the line, it's a lot to handle. I believe in him! #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
Loved Billy's brisket at @oakacresbbq - really delicious, perfectly cooked. #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV
Loved meeting Clarence @babybackshak- a real character with great enthusiasm. #hungryinvestors @SpikeTV

@jfkramer love it!! That's not easy!
So much fun chatting with y'all! This talk is EXACTLY what inspired My Family Table. #superchefkids thx @Crissy @bounty @childrensplace
A chef's nights in the kitchen can run late so I get my time with the boys in the morning over a big family breakfast.  #superchefkids
Traditions are so important in my family, but the best part is having the time around the table with my boys. #superchefkids
Love the @Chef_Aaron version of pesto. Cotija cheese, pepitas... genius. Check out episode one to see the #superchefkids recreate it!
I was super impressed by the #superchefkids knowledge of ingredients. How do you teach your kids about what you are cooking with?
.@carissarogers I don't encourage food fights, BUT I want my boys to have fun cooking. A little mess is worth it sometimes! #SuperchefKids
Just loved filming #superchefkids Their enthusiasm, respect for each other and love for the kitchen were awe-inspiring.
Enjoyed the heck out of making @superchefkids with @chef_aaron http://t.co/9L4s6qsx Amazing kids and some fun competitions!

@buddhalite we can be the many, and when the many demand it the market will follow.
btw, L'Shana Tova Y'all! Bless you all and good night!
@ediblearia I won't change your mind tonight, must tend to my work, please call your representatives and let them know what you expect.
@ediblearia it's my impression that the market should demand. We demand and they deliver! Both from our officials and food suppliers!
@ediblearia well we don't elect corporations but we do elect government. For that matter we could collectively never eat another Mcnuggat
@ediblearia but through the legislative process we could effect change as well as speaking with the farmers directly, no?
@la_newbiefoodie soon it'll be gumbo weather...
@ediblearia no you're really talking about our government, aren't you? What if we all got involved in this next farm bill?
@ediblearia yeah but casting vast dispersions over the many just to catch the few soils the catch. This is why I signed up. We must demand
@BethBader have a slew of chickens and a few pain in the butt roosters that'll soon be coq au vin
@ediblearia my family has been farming since they came here, they aren't foxes, they're conflicted yes. We need to shape the dialogue
Sorry y'all, just passionate about solutions. I can't grow enough food to support my ventures, I need a dialogue to help shape tomorrow
Look, food is that common thread that links all 350,000,000 or so of us together, we've got to figure this out by us coming to the table.
@ediblearia you are passionate, we all should be. I urge you to participate in the discussion. All we can do is make a positive impact!
If we the market demand it the suppliers will be forced to deliver.
@ediblearia right and what are we going to do about communicating such? We have to participate in a discussion, otherwise what?
@ediblearia I'd also love a world where we didn't need any of those and on my farm we don't use them! As a people we can demand better, no?
@ediblearia please follow our food dialogues, because that's precisely where the conversation started!
@ediblearia what if I told you all living animals have hormones? Perhaps we don't want added hormones, I'd agree
@Stefanie0412 now we find ourselves as a people in a very precarious position yet we still don't participate, just complain and tweet
@ediblearia look up USFRA and tell me This is all about communicating with the farmers and ranchers directly about what we the people want.
@ptwajackie silly people who yap at the heels of people who take a risk at making a difference.
@yolihugg oyster dressing, none of that up there in Little Rock, come on down!
We say we want change yet won't speak with the other side? When we do venture out into a world that doesn't see it our way, we tweet?
@yolihugg too funny, who dat!
I think it time that America hardens up instead of hiding behind political agendas, when will we be able to speak freely and make changes?
@ediblearia nice try but at the very least disclose that even UCBerkley had a role in the discussion. How about the dialogue? Is it worth it
@ediblearia not exactly but nice try, At the very least disclose that many from Berkley were present and give the stage!
Remember when dumb people just said stuff, how I miss those days...god bless us all!
@conesone direct message me and I'll talk real figures, till then learn your facts before tweeting nonsense
@SuperGlueMom @momables you are so wonderful always out there fighting the fight!
@conesone where are you now? If you want to support small guys then see what you can do with our local dairy guys, dropping like flies.
@conesone btw, they are not all all farmers. From large to small, this is about a dialogue from producer to cook, I welcome you to join us
@conesone the key is what are we doing to make a difference? Are we using our talents to shape a new future? We all need to be part of this
@conesone if I leave my restaurants for anything you must either pay a rate or make a large donation, just like Claire Shipman, standard.
@conesone hey Kenny, follow me so I can direct message you! Too funny, remember you by misspelling French, remember?
@intercitykitty @jaunt1junkie thanks so much y'all! Hope ya have a great time in this wonderful city!

@Appetite4Profit @cowartandmore agree totally with that as well. That's a discussion there. We spoke for hours and only scratched at it!
@agchat @kansfarmer it is a bit impersonal, you're right! I don't think of my guests or clients as customers or cover counts.
@RayLinDairy speaking about there are many more of those that don't pay attention to the la les than do. I'm a proponent for responsibility
@farmerhaley yes, we need to get back to our roots of farming, cooking and eating responsibly

All you @Official_Saints fans, The American Sector will show tonights game on the big screen! #NOLA #whodat #NOLA
@FoodRepub it will be a heck of a game though! Love both quarterbacks
@FoodRepub is there even any competition between Saints food and Packer food? Really?
@YourBishop @richardblais @chef_keller @chefchiarello what you have in your neck of the woods? thinking build arnd figs & sweet corn
@krys930 @charliep331 now that sounds incredibly good!!
@opmorningbreeze this week our first micro loan to farmers and Scholarship winner headed to NYC in Nov. Very exciting!

Speaking of chili, I'm helping with the FBI chili cook-off today. Needless to say, I ate no breakfast & worked out for 2 hrs. I'm starving!
@PaulMcRambles personally a rockachaw (stanislaus) but son is linebacker for Jesuit.
@chris_selk much emotion after Katrina anniversary and now our guys feeding Tx fire victims, pretty cool hearing how it helps
@EricMahlzeit how refreshing!
Yeah, in NOLA we talk dinner at breakfast. I'm saving Jambalaya and gumbo for the Jesuit vs Holy Cross game Friday! Thinking thick beef ribs
Can't believe Saints football is back, looking forward to a great game. What are y'all cooking tonight?
@dkinbluz I hear ya!
@TerrelBailey wow, I've been there myself, too many times. Powerful!
@angiestandridge will do better than that, I'll send a book for a baby. Where 2?
@yolihugg who dat!
When I speak of one of our chefs doing good acts through food it's not about Besh, but it's about what we can all do each day. That's change
Too often food is now only something we "rate" as opposed to something we enjoy. That's what I love about NOLA, we not only enjoy, we love!
Food is that one common thread that brings us all together, imagine that we could make the world a better one through food.
@JB002 @foodnetwork @cookingchannel would love to however not up to me..

@JustinNystrom very jealous
@MyCookingCorner lord have mercy, sounds delicious!

@HPS_TrulyYours I couldn't have said it better!
@tommymcdowell I love all! This year will be even better!
@mandyamato have fun at the beach!
@tommymcdowell sounds great, what'll we cook?
@nolanolegal @duris @chefmarysonnier @nworlnconcierge congratulations! I love being a father.
@mandyamato after firing up the grill I'll throw a few extra things on like chicken for a quick Vietnamese chicken salad in lettuce wraps
@mandyamato grilled corn salad, roasted jalepeno shrimp ceviche, fried plantains and mango salsa. What about a white sangria?
@mandyamato beach is for fun and light eaten by hand. Grilled grouper tacos with heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado, cilantro Dressing
@duris @chefmarysonnier @nworlnconcierge crazy.
@ChefMarySonnier yeah, Jared Tees is doing a magical job on the menu!
@SchefMarcus go to our website and shoot us an e mail!
@badfaery well, just saying when I do or when I dream of a cocktail it's on a Sunday afternoon, my day off, after a small feast.
@sportsJC16 yeah you right! Can't wait for the season to begin, don't know how much of our boys we'll see tonight with pre-season. Who Dat!
@sportsJC16 no experience with them. I love high school football, it's all about the young men and coaches, parents stay out of it.
Don't you think certain cocktails belong to Sunday days whereas late afternoons & evenings belong to wine? 2 more games left.
@NwOrlnConcierge @chefmarysonnier too funny... Really it's these folks that are so into every move these kids make as they sit screaming
@NwOrlnConcierge @chefmarysonnier too funny.. Really o  N
@ChefMarySonnier no joke, there's a big fat redneck with a dirty mouth, that I'm trying to avoid, before I lose it...
@JustinNystrom no, I need something stronger like a triple Pimms Cup from the Napoleon House, do they deliver??
Totally reminds me of the movie Kicking and Screaming. I love sports and children, it's the parents that are warped..
Really could write a book about this insanity of parents living through their children. What ever happened to Sundays??
At the soccer fields today Besh boys playing against each other, nothing nice! Not sure if it's just me but travel sports are for the birds
@CreativCulinary @bakingblog it's all relative and a out us being responsible in the way that we live and eat. Still love white truffles too
@surnostables it was so much fun to meet y'all as well as share the positive energy of people coming together for the sake of good!
@skinnygirleats @nanciemac right Tomatoes are more of a jambalaya controversy and okra or no okra is a gumbo dilemma.
@EveningChef @neworleansfoody my house on Monday night! Other than that, Dooky Chase for Monday lunch. I love Miss Leah!!
@israeliwine @lisamattsonwine I miss you Israel waiting for new shipment of Yarden wines. Planning next trip now! Shalom y'all

@andrewzimmern Q1. It takes 140 characters for me just to say hello! #FRchat
@lindsaybaish @FoodRepub Q1. I think facebook allows for more content and an in depth look into a subject but it's not as immediate #FRchat
@YoonkiPark1 that's a definite red flag! Might want to rethink this one! #FRchat
@FoodRepub Q1. 140 characters won't let me engage fully with a topic. It's hard to convey passion and love in a soundbite #FRChat

@ali4pres I'm no fan of thick and gloopy étouffée so I generally let the sauce reduce and thicken in the pan prior to adding the shellfish.

@nofster58 too many young chefs don't take their own palettes seriously, by leaving work and eating garbage. To be a chef takes commitment.
@nofster58 don't wastes your time eating anything that isn't incredible. If it's pizza make it the best same applies to burgers and caviar!
