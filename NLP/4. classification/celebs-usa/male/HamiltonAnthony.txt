Even in our anger, disappointment and pain we must exercise patience and wisdom. They wanna send arm forces in on us. Don't stoop low people
I urge my people to stand down and stop looting because that ain't helping nobody. All they will do is tax us and steal that money back.
I've just seen too much of the same shit! We don't wanna be pacified and we don't wanna be distracted with media bull! We want y'all to feel
My kids want experience slavery except for when I teach them true history and allow them to see what we had to go through. On all I Love!!!
