@CTFxCanswers That‚Äôs crazy!
Is there a reason why the keys on a keyboard are all random? I‚Äôve always wondered https://t.co/UK0ZQHGsNq
I feel it would be hilarious to finally get around to reading ‚Äúmean comments‚Äù - if you see any in the videos  (going for cleverly mean) If you find some - screen shot them and reply to this tweet. I think it'd be fun and long overdue! Let's find the funny ones hahah
@makemebad35 @YouTube Hahaha
@makemebad35 @YouTube Lol
Finally got today‚Äôs video up and it‚Äôs awesome. I was able to go back to see what‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt on January 10th of the last 8 years! It‚Äôs crazy I am able to do that! https://t.co/Fa6PSeyr4k check it out!
wow‚Ä¶ THIRD TIME! Gee, thanks @youtube - crazy to think what is cool on the site and what is not‚Ä¶ good to know for the future üòí https://t.co/i0ydM5Fd96

Holy shit‚Ä¶ seriously‚Ä¶ last night was the worst ever‚Ä¶ video uploading now and you‚Äôll see (its the net is slow here)
One state down! Three to go! Operation find snow!! https://t.co/zsuFN4HdMa
Sorry, should‚Äôve clarified. More in the areas of North/south Carolina, northern Georgia and Virginia
@MarioDiPlacido Where?
@nascarmamma63 You think it‚Äôs going to be snowing for the next couple days? Or at least snow on the ground?
@alyssahasalife On the ground? Enough to where it be there for the next couple days?
Apparently, there‚Äôs not much snow in the next couple weeks on the East Coast of the United States. Trying to find some places that have snow or will have snow in the next week and Northern Georgia or North Carolina. Thoughts?
@mirandafox78 I believe I did, but alright
@bensnacks Love you bro
I‚Äôm done with this Logan thing. Those who defend these actions I‚Äôm embarrassed for all of us on YouTube. For those other people, keep being awesome. I‚Äôve said my peace. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@GeorgeBruhh_ Cool story bro.
@sayhi2kimberly I mean this politely, but you‚Äôve got to me messing with me right now?! üò≥
On a more positive thing. What was your favorite moment(s) from the CTFxC vlogs THIS YEAR Only!
Hope you like it!! RT @LuRosexoxo: @CharlesTrippy @AllieWes ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/xvZsRajXeV
@PapeMagic Laughing is a human reaction. I have awkward laughs too but I would never film and then edit and upload a video like this. There isn‚Äôt any excuses that could justify this. Also. Thank you for watching so long!! Means a lot!
@jessiben77 22 is an adult. Don‚Äôt defend it please. A mistake isnt filming a suicide victim for YouTube. That‚Äôs a travosty.
I do, but that means we as a community have a world record together!! RT @ThisislikeBuffy: Charles holds the world record for vlogging daily btw https://t.co/PPFHXkEZzU
The WORST part is seeing all these "smaller" channels being hit for way less! Its a hypocritical time on YouTube sadly. I hope that they use him &amp; this situation as an example and stand by their "rules" they hold EVERYONE else to! They probably won't though which is disheartening https://t.co/b18pyZhG2X
@M_Caitlin_ DeSoto dog beach
@TriforceRay Wrist are you even talking about? I have watched it. It‚Äôs disgusting.
@sophiehellyer Will do! Hah, the idea of a diary calendar sounds hilariously awesome
@sophiehellyer Totally agree with you! For sure! you doing well? I think We The Kings has a couple shows in England maybe. If so, bring everyone you know! ü§üüèº
@BestlerGrace @duranduranceci That isn‚Äôt the point and I‚Äôm going to give up on this with you because you are fading to see the point. You have contradicted yourself too much now. I respect you and I hope you see the light here.
@sophiehellyer You read that apology right? The same one? People do make mistakes, I‚Äôm guilty of that, but this is pretty hard to just forgive with just an apology. Think if you experienced a horrific situation like that ‚Ä¶would you accept that apology that he half assed.
@kinghorne01 It‚Äôs a very interesting forest, there‚Äôs really no denying it. I don‚Äôt think going to the forest is the wrong thing. The good thing is that other people wouldn‚Äôt show that, but you‚Äôre smart you get it!
@sampottorff We can get through it, only 364 days left until 2019!
@BestlerGrace No one should ever know what to do in that situation. I think people are missing the point here.
@Mssky @DonLoBau @LoganPaul Of course and if they uploaded the same content. I would say the same thing about them. Going to the forest isn‚Äôt the issue here. I love ghost stories and everything. Also, you proved my point with your last 7 words.
@BestlerGrace @disturbedfanma1 Annnd we circle back again‚Ä¶. üò≥üòï
@Hoopla151 Gotcha, however, those examples (while I get where you‚Äôre coming from) are no where close to this situation. I think this conversion is happening within the community because it‚Äôs disgusting.
@Mssky @LoganPaul That‚Äôs amazing and I‚Äôm honored you‚Äôve watched that long, however, I‚Äôm not necessary judging him‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm more ashamed this is even a conversation.
@duranduranceci @BestlerGrace What she said üëèüèº
@Hoopla151 Curious how my tweet found its way into your timeline since you don‚Äôt follow it?  As long as you are aware it‚Äôs disgraceful and we are on that same page about that. I‚Äôll agree with you.
@Mssky @LoganPaul Of course I have, you think that‚Äôs on any level remotely close? üò≥
@Hoopla151 I respect your opinion, I‚Äôm all ears - so please justify why what he did (even if he added a mention of suicide prevention) was warrented.
@BestlerGrace Gracie, he could of talked about that very important subject easily without showing a man who actually committed the act. If he talked about it as a subject I would have praised him, I‚Äôm embarrassed this was even on YouTube.
@BestlerGrace Don‚Äôt justify it. His reaction is appropriate, it‚Äôs a human reaction. Uploading it to the internet is not. There are lines and they are so far gone on this subject is not even close.
@EllaT2003 Probably the only thing appropriate about that video. I think you can still send that important message WITHOUT showing a man who hung themself.
@Hoopla151 Read what I wrote, it wasn‚Äôt hate.
What Logan Paul did is inexcusable, disgusting, disgraceful &amp; just sad. I hope we all learn something from this &amp; just become better people since this turd is apparently not able to do so. Dont encourage this behavior Youtube. It‚Äôs now your call, make us believe again. üòï

Turtle beach RT @Lakotawarrior60: @CharlesTrippy What kind of headset
Trying to play an Xbox game and I have headphones on. The only issue is that there is more sound on the right ear than the left. Is there a way to balance the audio between both the headphones so it‚Äôs even? Stupid question I know. I‚Äôm a noob LOL

@StephVdl3 @box_art 40mph+ vs 5mph so quite a lot. destinations/highways vs around the block with my pups.
That was my last bit of "independence" of doing things without people's help too. Genuinely upset about it. I know it sounds dumb.

Time to shut up and fly home. Done ranting but seriously, fuck that guy. üòÇ
Anyway, both Allie and I are in middle seats in random spots on the plane so it's not like we're in first class.
@NabilaZaira @_kelly_gibson_ I don't think they mean nor do I the action of kicking the seat but the courtesy of helping someone.
@Beatiinx Ive done it before so Im not saying anything I wouldnt do. &amp; Ive flown hundreds of thousands of miles &amp; I'd do it in a heartbeat.
@a_gooze they're not kicking the dude off the plane. Just switching seats to sit next to his 10month old.
I'm literally in 41e so yes.  RT @jamilhendrix: @CharlesTrippy why? Easy to say from your position huh?
This isn't about Allie &amp; I. I'm just witnessing it in front of me. I plan on kicking his seat the whole damn time if he doesn't switch. Oops
I could go on forever about this. I'll just leave it at: you are an asshole. I've switched to middle seats for families so many times
If u have a seat next to a family w/ a kid &amp; one of the parents ask you to switch. Just be a good human and switch regardless of the seat.
We love you  RT @PlaylistLive: Love these two :) @CharlesTrippy @AllieWes https://t.co/HpeoB1ELfW
Actually. I think it may work out so I will be at the meet and greet really quick before our flight! üëçüèº
