Zarya &amp; Unity had never been in the same hemisphere on Earth, but they fit together perfectly‚Äìand so began the International Space Station.
Zarya was followed a few weeks later by the node Unity, the first U.S. segment, carried by Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-88.
It was on Nov. 20, 1998, that a Russian Proton rocket lifted the first ISS module, Zarya, into space.
This week, we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the beginning of the International Space Station. Happy Birthday ISS!

Gravity story for which I was interviewed in USA Today: http://t.co/4LhhVlTSpA
Seeing SNL live was unbelievable, two space skits, Katie Perry, and a Weekend Update reference to my friend @neiltyson, great experience!
Going to be in the audience for Saturday Night Live tonight, watching it since 1975 on TV will see it in person for the first time
I have discovered that successful people are not those who never failed, but rather those who never let failure stop them from trying
I hope young people are inspired by #Gravity as I was inspired by The Right Stuff, follow up by studying something you are passionate about
You can checkout the podcast of my conversation with @nerdist  - http://t.co/16ndJ14l5L - I love those guys!
Here is my interview from CNN's #NewDay http://t.co/AzSGRGVhzX
I suggest that people use #Gravity for inspiration and use it as motivation to learn  about what is really going on in space #ISS
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay Grazie, Paisano!
@MichaelaCNN @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @KateBolduan You bet!
Was on CNN's @NewDay this morning, the anchors made me feel like one of the family - thanks @ChrisCuomo, @KateBolduan, @MichaelaCNN
My favorite space movie documentary is still IMAX Hubble 3D, I am so proud that my Hubble crew mates and I contributed to that film
#Gravity shows accurate space equipment, awesome views of the Earth, and that space exploration can be a dangerous business
Just as I was inspired by the movie "The Right Stuff" 30 years ago, I hope young people today will be inspired by #Gravity
We should remember that #Gravity is a movie, not a documentary, it is entertaining while also bringing the wonder of space to the big screen
.@nowthisnews mobile social news, great bunch of young people reporting the news in a new way http://t.co/rWwOzx38tK
https://t.co/GjVVpM8wz1 These are some my favorite space films
@SomethingNewED Not quite that cold, but we only touch an exposed airlock with our spacesuits on, it warms up after the spacewalk
@ntabrizy @nowthisnews Temperatures can get as cold as -200 degrees F, and as warm as +200 F, but the spacesuit keeps us comfy
@CyrusVJ @nowthisnews When the engines lit and we started moving I thought "maybe this wasn't such a good idea," then just enjoy the ride
@nowthised @nowthisnews What they wear underneath their spacesuits is a lot more flattering that what we wear during real spacewalks
@mayatee @nowthisnews From Hubble altitude (350 miles) can see Earth as a huge round globe, for spacewalking water is a great simulation
@cboals @nowthisnews On the shuttle we brought it back to Earth, on the Space Station it gets packed and burns up in the atmosphere
@qkatie @nowthisnews breakfast before a spacewalk: peanut butter on a tortilla, blueberry yogurt, energy bar, water
@DailyDanMilano about 45 minutes normally, emergency can be quicker, never want the door to blow open
@msladyfrost @nowthisnews not really, we train and practice for just about everything and we learn to work with our team -creates confidence
Another segment featuring more of my interview with @DavidMuir and @abcnews about #Gravity: http://t.co/Fk5aw2Dibo
My ABC News Person of the Week segment with @DavidMuir  has been posted, I talk about my experiences and #Gravity: http://t.co/IMLxTEcH2X
In #Gravity I saw an exact replica of our space shuttle from my last spaceflight including the IMAX camera we used to film IMAX Hubble 3D
During the first ten minutes of #Gravity I was inspecting the accuracy of the shuttle and Hubble in the set more than watching the actors
@neiltyson My wife described watching my real spacewalks like "watching grass grow and then poof something exciting happens"
My good friend @neiltyson has some interesting observations about #Gravity, I am following his tweets
In #Gravity I saw our #8 Powertool floating behind Sandra Bullock's head,I nicknamed that tool "Yogi Berra" who wore #8 in his baseball days
In #Gravity I saw an exact replica of the Hubble Space Telescope, space suits, and the tools we used on our mission with incredible detail
Now the #Gravity is out, I hope it inspires people to think more about what is going on in space on the International Space Station
The ABC World News Person of the Week segment I did with @DavidMuir is now online http://t.co/2G6CKoQKyH
I had an absolute blast talking with @DavidMuir from @ABCWorldNews, I was impressed with his preparation and knowledge of the space program
