@halladayfan32 I’m great, work is fun, I’m dealing with an injury from jiujitsu, but I’ll be fine. How are you?
@halladayfan32 Hey Matt!
Final day of the book cover challenge. This one is about my cousins. #bookchallenge #leftovermonkeyshit https://t.co/iXMDBv5FA9
@Patrick_Wyman Cmon pat, you love his rakish hat and want to partake in the maximum amount of boot.
I’m so happy to sit in traffic when I have a @CitationsPod lined up to listen to! All in on this #whataboutism
@MiddleEasy @bryan_barberena He is the modern day Chris Lytle and the easiest fighter in MMA to root for. Guarantee I buy the PPV if he’s on it. I’d love to bring him out to @Cubs spring training if he’s interested. I think he’s an AZ guy. @bryan_barberena let me know.

@dscntpapabear @TP_Grant I will proselytize.  Anyone that is interested in grappling should, start today.  Even as I sit here, unable to train for the next 3-5 weeks because of a hamstring tear, I think many can benefit from any grappling Art. Sambo - Wrestling - BJJ - Judo
@TP_Grant - I’ll rely on your expertise, where would you send a beginner to start jiujitsu in Chicago?  I’ve heard great things about Redzovic and also Valko. But never trained there.  I go to Copa right by Wrigley when I’m there. https://t.co/BIsUPuC2Dp

@halladayfan32 Hey Matt!
I need to amend the last one. That roll to heel hook is the #RyanHall roll as to my naive grappling eyes it differs slightly from the imanari roll
The Imanari Roll to heel hook @ryanhall5050 hit on BJ was a work of martial art.   @chadmendes and @alexvolkanovski lit up the cage with violence.  Most entertaining card I’ve seen in a while.
Shout out to @fryerbuckwild for hosting #UFC232 last night - we started with @plinytheelder finished with @ProperWhiskey - hangs with @edmayart &amp; @willbakermusic   @JonnyBones and @Amanda_Leoa are the two greatest MMA fighters of all time. The @ufc finished 2018 strong. 🙏

@MiddleEasy I’m rooting for Jon Jones too.
@HustonStreet I miss you. Your athletic ability was surpassed only by Jason Marquis

@tgibson62 Also @bakadesuyo has a great website and offers insight on self-compassion.   @RyanHoliday books on stoicism: The Obstacle is the Way. The Daily Stoic and Ego is the Enemy.

@tgibson62 Impossible to coach someone during the moment.  Young players must learn competitive resilience.  Self-compassion + returning to the present moment = resilience in competition.   So what. Now what?   Training that is a long process.

@halladayfan32 I’m good Matt, you? Tough to watch baseball right now. What did you think about the play at first base with Machado and Aguilar?

He’s trying to break his left arm. Savage
This is amazing. Super hard to watch for some reason. Probably because it’s so one-sided.
Rd 1: Grappling works
My nightmare is this is Silva/Sonnen-like in the way it plays out.   Of course that implies a miracle triangle, which I’m also into.   #UFC229
@dmoschet Yeah about that championship...
Khabib walking in second is also weird. It’s been a weird night.   Weird in all the right ways.
I’m not mad at Duke Roufus. More of that should happen.

@geoffreywoo Yes and...reading is a basic mindfulness exercise. Focusing on what one is reading, noticing the mind wandering when we don’t process a page or sentence or paragraph and then reorienting our attention back to the object: the words.

@norcalbbgm @harrypav Keep teaching the kids to practice hitting line drives in the middle of the field. Every trend sees a regression to the mean eventually, make sure your guys play a complete game like they always have. Your system is great for the game!
@NorCalbbgm here is the reason for more homers. I don’t know how much average launch angle has changed, but my man @harrypav and friends breaks it down here  https://t.co/AFfxQLxumn
@BelieveOrleave Somewhere in the ether. Come this year 7/21 we will celebrate. All proceeds going to a family that experienced a very trying time. Fanny packs for all. More details soon.

@chilidawgz Nope. I’m out on those.  1. not a fanny pack.  2. I only wear my @VIVOBAREFOOT sandals. #TotalEclipse
@drivelinebases Ricky Nolasco tore his Meniscus tying his shoe after a bullpen once, so yeah, I know what you mean.
@drivelinebases If you can’t jog or walk onto the field without getting injured no cart should be able to save you.

@norcalbbgm @ARizzo44 @MLB It’s about balancing the 3 true outcome style of hitting with playing a more college style game. You have to be able to win multiple ways. Including beating the new defensive alignments.
@norcalbbgm @ARizzo44 The best chance to get a hit at any exit velocity is a line drive in the middle of the field.   At the @MLB level it isn’t about learning HOW, to hit the ball to beat a shift, they know how, it’s knowing WHEN to attempt it.
If you can go to this conference, go, you won’t regret your time there. https://t.co/OoHwyXQcQe

@theaceofspaeder Super weird

@theaceofspaeder Likely 3rd baseman back and base hit turns the line-up over. Albies leads off an inning and Mcarthy has a chance to accidentally knock in a run.   Also, 0-1 pitchers count.   2 outs right? What was the pitching match-up?
@CherylAlanna @Walgreens I understand. But what about when I’m standing right there. And my scrip was called in before I got there, and they knew I was coming.

@Max_thePower Honestly, one of the more annoying behaviors I see, occasionally, in professional sports are the people like me, in the support system, that try and take credit for the performance of the performers.

@rolmeda No, the offended were being idiots, it was like 2003 and if you put a swastika on something at a baseball field you obviously don’t know what it means. No matter where you’re from. And when you learn, you take it off.

@rolmeda We did. Immediately. The question I was asked was what is the weirdest thing I ever saw in baseball.
@rolmeda Franklin Gomez was not an idiot. He was from The DR and was shot and killed there. He was uneducated and didn’t know what that symbol meant. When we explained it to him he was horrified. Save it.

Google is letting me down, I need #BaseballTwitter to help me out. Are there any left handed hitters that were noticeably better against left handed pitchers than right handed pitchers, for their careers?
1) this is crazy 2) Barbosa was so befuddled by the new born deer feint that he walked his hips right into a double leg. 3) This fight was very brutal, and despite losing, Barbosa is ALL HEART. https://t.co/VkChDNtJUB

@Kingsbu I begrudgingly took it off, only to put it right back on. I felt naked, alone and afraid for a brief moment in time on the jetway.

@andyhnilo @TrueDarkZone What blue light? https://t.co/m4iwANyUTJ
Big fan of this style of play. Single, pitcher bunt, 2 strike base hit the other way. Base hit, first to third, sac fly into wind, both guys tag, 2 out rbi single, HBP, 2 out RBIs...look out. #LetsGo

@theaceofspaeder *This guy sucks  That isn’t mean enough for philly.
@ufcfightpass I buy nearly every fight, I paused the main event before it started to put a kid back to bed and when I hit play it skipped to the post fight interview. How do I get a reimbursement? Couldn’t even rewind. $65!
Pause the f’ing @UFC while Iaquinta is walking in (on the Apple TV app) to help my kid go back to bed. Come back, hit play, it skips to post fight interview with Khabib. I can’t rewind. I want my $ back. This is garbage.
Amazing fight. @joannamma @rosenamajunas
0 points for that takedown.
These two fighters are so good. #ufc223 #comainevent #WomensMMA
Love Joe but so far this isn’t the blow out he’s calling out. Seems close to me. 🤷‍♂️ #ufc223
When Rose moves around the octagon it reminds me of how Jon Jones moves. Anyone else see that?
@NakedGambling Stop the fight - the body is done. Cut it off
@halladayfan32 So fun. You should go there and try it.
@DadFailed They already do. I don’t know if there is a limit. Everyone scouts everyone else, it’s like spy vs spy.
I signed a permission slip in Milwaukee once. I then slid down the Bernie Brewer slide at least 50 times before the game that day. Best slide I’ve ever been on.

@drudown1414 If you know that I care about your success, you will be more likely to trust my sign.   Catchers, develop a servant mentality, the W, and the pitchers numbers are more important than your hitting stats. Period.
@drudown1414 The pitching/catching/PC relationships are invaluable. Consistent execution is more easily attainable when trust and compassion are the underlying themes of the interactions.
@drudown1414 Or you can just be a robot, trust that I’m putting down the right fingers, and execute. 🤔😉😎

@TimBong1 Psychological exam? What accepted standard test will we use?   This problem doesn’t seem to have any feasible answers.   But there has to be one. There has to. We should all think about it.
@andrew_cuda @azshadowwalker @robneyer How do we get better without comparing ourselves to our past?
@intrepidlw Because he liked shooting guns?
@TimBong1 It would be harder to kill people though.
@andrew_cuda @azshadowwalker @robneyer How violent are we as a society? Has violence decreased over time?
@thitchner @AndrewWryly Well, for one, they HAVE GUNS.
@BMcCarthy32 @robneyer So what do we do? Lots of hunters in baseball, maybe it’s time for some of those people to use their platform and speak up.
@LucasCShaffer None. AR-15s are made and designed to kill humans.
@AndrewWryly Yeah, people with guns consenting to random Federal government inspection seems likely...
@Ed_Stade_IV From who? Are you suggesting I patrol the block around my kids school or something?   Or were you joking?
@DALLASBRADEN209 @robneyer While we are worried about cutters, hit and runs and bunt plays people are out there making money off all this death, sadness and destruction like vampires. Gross.
@TheSteve_Slater @ameliacubs12 @NRA Then what? What are you going to go get all the guns from people?
Also, I’ve got a bunch of friends that are hunters, so I also see instances and know people that are responsible and use the gun to go get food, and I’m trying to figure out how that fits in.
@Gordon1938 It’s definitely about guns. That’s not the only thing it is about, but it’s like, most of what it’s about. But yes, it’s also about mental illness.
@robneyer Now you’ve got me going.  Balance this.   It is legal to take opiates, have a cocktail or six and possess a gun.  AND, we’ve locked people up for possessing a little cannabis.   How does that POSSIBLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO ANY THINKING PERSON?
@robneyer Business is booming in the prison game. Disgusting as well.
@garyrockrose Ok. Great. What do they do?
@BrianCubs2016 Then what? There are lots of guns everywhere, they are cheap and easy to acquire.
@Cottonword Want to hear something scary? When I was playing in Florida I got a concealed carry permit and became a lifetime member of the NRA for insurance purposes.  It is something I regret daily. Guns are locked up, haven’t been fired in years.
Also, what countries could we use as a model? Someone is doing this better than us. Australia has a gun ban right? https://t.co/g2MD1efoV6
Couple Q’s in light of recent events FLA   1) what are we going to do about all of the school shootings?   2) how can I possibly help? I don’t know the first thing about gun laws or regulation, or what I can even do.

@swankmotron Resplendent is a word I just had to look up.
#DoSimpleBetter https://t.co/rPhCj4igh5
@GreekGodOfHops Are we training to get a hit? Or are we practicing a swing to produce a certain measurable outcome? Are we doing both?   This isn’t either/or.  However when it comes to a 7 year old, if you’re filling his head with physics oriented outcomes he can’t comprehend? C’mon son.
@GreekGodOfHops In their head that they are swinging down on the ball, coming from ‘on top’ - like they are trying to hit the ball on the ground?   Yes, launch angle/exit velocity ideas are correct, how think to get there varies between each individual.
@GreekGodOfHops Let’s get complicated.   Batting average &amp; slugging are very high when when exit velocity reaches a certain threshold and the launch angle falls between a certain range. I don’t know the exact #s.   But. What if. To produce that result in the game, the hitter, (gasp) thinks...
#DuckDuck https://t.co/4EVVaY3xgP
Funny watching former successful big leaguers arguing with amateur coaches about hitting, launch angle, approach, exit velocity etc.  Stop it all of you. This isn’t some sort of 2 sided issue that can be debated. It isn’t that simple.

Savannah or Bengal? I’m allergic and I’ve only had dogs.

@cameron954 @TeamKhabib I thought Cyborg/Holm was great. First time Cyborg has had a competitive fight. I still had it 50-45 Cyborg.
@FurysFightPicks I don’t know much, but I’m pretty sure that was 50-45 Cyborg and it wasn’t that difficult to score. I was really surprised when they read the scores.
To make it fair it needs to be @TeamKhabib against at least 2 other humans in consecutive fights. That was so scary to watch. #UFC219

@willmenaker Why did you make me see that? It cannot be unseen. It’s also the Verrit follower list.
Best part about this RV trip is that the auto-leveler won’t work so we have been stuck in @fryerbuckwild driveway for 3 days. At least it got us here.

@DALLASBRADEN209 One an inning is too much. Explains a lot about you.
@BrodieNBCS @DALLASBRADEN209 How is that a story? Weight lifters, hockey, baseball, football. Maybe find Sports where they don’t use it?
@Kelly_greenivy @jordanbpeterson I heard it, rewound and listened to it over and over. I can do better. We all can.
@NakedGambling John Lineker is the champion under these rules.
@jordanbpeterson I’ve got a lot to work on, to change and to improve. Reminds me of the quote from Gandhi, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” Starts with me and no one else.
“How many things are you doing that you know are wrong, that you could fix, that you aren’t fixing?” @jordanbpeterson
@LiveYesAnd @lifrakattack Awesome Travis!

@NakedGambling That is the greatest clip in the history of MMA.
@jessespector I’m guilty of being the neutral observer here for sure.
He pitched yesterday, today and to-Morrow   🤷‍♂️🤐
@unlikelyfanatic Lol I love the poor performance = doesn’t care line of broken logic.
Geez Morrow the real participation MVP of this thing. 7/7! Crazy.
No one has called me to ask, so, nope. https://t.co/12V0uCqHh8
Welp  Seems like the Astros are trying to suck the drama out of this game. (How selfish)   From now on I’m rooting for whoever is losing to tie it up.
Hitterish swing from McCullers. Wow.
No contact play there? Chopper? Pitcher up next? I know Mac is slow, but he may have scored.
I think the closest thing I saw to McCullers CB was prime Brad Lidge. That slider was nasty too, but this may be a new level.
@PeterMoylan It’s GROSS
If Joc does something here and the Doyers win he’s the MVP.
#RIP Rick Hader I saw him on a AAA travel day once at Dallas-Love. We recognized each other and he bought me a coffee. Great guy and entertainer. https://t.co/LX7WW60HcD
Man that breaking ball McCullers is flat out DISGUSTING.
@GianSanity Man, I loved that guy. Time to wet my eyebrows and dance to prince in his honor.
@GianSanity What? Really?
@JennyWesterkamp I didn’t see that in the presentation!

@bretthayes12 Lol! You were ROBBED!
@DCameronFG Game comes on and my 6 year old instinctively presses mute. She knows how I feel about Baseball interrupted by nonsense.
@DCameronFG Tough for me to hear the commentary with the volume on mute.

Last year I was drinking beer with Luke Gregerson at the WS at Wrigley, this year I get to have a beer in his honor and watch him pitch. So cool, also, he was rooting for the @Cubs
@Picklenose1 Luke has balls of steel, you could grease the ball and he'd still want to pitch. He is all about competing, not an excuse maker.
@RaymondLoretto @theaceofspaeder also, completely different view, face is right behind the glove, whereas when you are hitting your head is in a totally different place.
@RaymondLoretto @theaceofspaeder Because it is hard to hit even if you know/are pretty sure what is coming. That is how hard hitting is
@Picklenose1 well, Luke has always thrown nearly all sliders, so...more coming
@TommyToeHold you can do it
I bet Luke throws some sliders...
@SethSamuelson would be awful for everyone right? totally ruining baseball with these boring gams...😜
Super clutch pick by Bellinger. Such a boring World Series this year, no drama at all...

I can definitely see a walk a bloop and a 3 run homer walk-off. After the last few innings nothing would surprise me.
@mjd1735 I played baseball as a visitor in Philly and New York, my feelings are really difficult to hurt now.
@ityazbec That person literally had to find me on the internet to ask me who I am...
Wow
@itr_TonyLadde It’s like they think I actually care who wins this game. Once the @Cubs lost I became general population baseball fan.
@court1079 Right? It’s like anything you write people can find away to turn it into a personal insult which was clearly directed at them.

@RandallJSanders Not at all although someone called me names and tried to hurt my feelings. Lol
@LuiC13 Why?
@stephaninimarie I retired in 2015. When I say retired I mean, no one gave me an opportunity to play anymore, so I’m not playing against anyone. How about you?

Amazing! Marwin sounds like the name of a wizard, and he probably is because that was magic!
@sporer If you’re a hitter that pitch is NSFWar
@snidog I like the Dodgers too. Both of these teams are so good.
@TheHerosJourney For sure great game. But Prince of Persia was most frustrating game ever

@Adam_PHN I don’t know anymore. I’m watching people drop knees on back picks at second and that isn’t a problem
@JDomski5 Yeah I agree, a split second before he had the ball, which was moving in the direction where his leg was moving, it (his leg) was blocking home plate. For sure.
@JDomski5 Good luck with that. You’ll find a lot of similar plays with different interpretations.
@PaulHHusch @Cubs 🙌
@JDomski5 How many plays have we had overturned at home plate for blocking the plate since 2014?
I’m also totally biased for the @Cubs so take all my analysis with a margarita rim of salt.
By the way, let me be clear that I absolutely respect the intention of the rule. I’m all for keeping people safe. That instance, however, I don’t like.
@JDomski5 Different situation, running to second and sliding is proactive, catching a ball off a bounce and trying to tag the runner/protect the plate/protect yourself is reactive.
@snidog You think it happened consciously?
@JDomski5 Great analysis. We’ll work on that next spring.
@KevinMcGann1 @yankeefancanada @robneyer He did catch it, and tag the runner out. Question is if he started his slide before Willson moved his leg in front of HP.
I love the “you’ve had four years to change” like what we have to change to is so obvious.   Watch the play in real-time. Not in slow motion. Happens so fast.
@JDomski5 How should we practice it? We stand in front of the plate and try to catch the ball while moving toward where the guy might be sliding. Very scientific
@DanOClock The runner had the right to not slide and run him over.
@robneyer Yes, and...they haven’t changed the way the play is practiced because most of baseball is unsure on what to do. Still.  I’d feel exactly the same if teams were reversed.
Exactly what he did is how we’ve all practiced for years. https://t.co/BgyXbcvd8q
@mike_petriello He couldn’t have put his leg in anymore danger than he did there.
He could have done that according to the rules. https://t.co/TLaGzQWxXO
Great plays by @WContreras40 and @kschwarb12 even when they don’t get credit for it.   Rule 713 can save it. #Out

@DavidCharles99 Probably, pretty sure he wasn't trying to throw it in the bleachers.
Congrats to Vuc!! https://t.co/owKEyaDiZg
@DavidCharles99 Pitching is about execution more so than hitter weakness.
@jeans_david I'd have to hit it twice with a metal bat to get it to that spot.
Phew. Atta boy CJ.
@bachlaw Grichuk is up too which is always scary for me
@bachlaw It's horrible
Wtf https://t.co/jtzyFVrn3b
Oh yes Oppo tacos are delicious and #KyleSchWoba likes to eat.
@Todorofflaw @dannyrube @AlanJouban I didn't
I'm still annoyed at the Adelaide Byrd scorecard for #GGG vs #Canelo  I need to chill
One game too many. https://t.co/gUNFQHKWl1
Usman can beat anyone in the weight class. Including Woodley/RDA/Masvidal/Cerrone/Maia.  170 #1 contender fight should be Covington/Usman.
@LukeRockhold has nasty jiujitsu.
Someone coach Rockhold on the mic.
@rileymusic Mayweather is done. GGG/Canelo 2...or GGG/Ward let's go
@EdLatimore school me about the 118-110 Bird score card?
Draw? Shoot me. Brutal. That was #GGG all day. Save it Bird.
Adelaide bird is drunk
Great fight. I got #GGG Please rematch or convince Andre Ward to cut some weight and fight the winner.
@diablobrandgi @DunkelSide I just got a black eye thinking about rolling with Matt!
Same https://t.co/urr95O6xyB
This fight is AWESOME. #CanelovsGolovkin  3-2 GGG
I got it 2-2 after that round. #CaneloGolovkin  But I don't know s**t about boxing scoring so take that with a sea full of salt.
@DunkelSide as a model?!? I need one of these. I'm texting you. https://t.co/adte5ksEOT

@RyanQDavis It's good! Thank you!
Everyone read this, thanks as always Harry! https://t.co/0wSWfFfhPe
@harrypav @mmmattlin12 @oldstyle81 That's not exactly a technique that he tries to employ on a frequent basis. What is the general umpire accuracy %?
@RandallJSanders 🖖
@mmmattlin12 @oldstyle81 I didn't watch that closely, how many pitches did he miss total? Cause I feel like they are generally about 90% accurate.... @harrypav ?
I get it. https://t.co/575t1DXUeF

@TheHerosJourney Taylor Davis got crossed up and like hit in the chest the game before and it was called a strike.
If you're a baseball player and you don't occasionally get red-line angry over something you can't control, then you're not doing it right.
@DavidCharles99 will say that I always worked well with Jordan and I still have respect for him. Umpiring is hard and they only get attention for screw ups
@crawlyscubs You know I love a good #umpshow so this still doesn't change my opinion. No robot umps until the tech is waaaay better.
@crawlyscubs I think competitive athletes are sometimes fueled by emotion and it's a normal thing to be frustrated. They want to win the World Series.
Rules have nothing to do with how it is caught. https://t.co/KeqvOpTHbZ

Re: #GGGCanelo - I'd make a pick in this fight but I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to boxing.   #KnowYourWeakness
Who is watching #GGG vs #Canelo tonight?
@lastcartridge @bpnutrition I don't know. Maybe @bpnutrition has an answer.

How about this, if I'm TC I play the infield in here.
Good to see Kyle running like that. Looking like a linebacker again.
@WindyCityFunk @TheCubsFeed @CarrieMuskat 5-4 bad guys
I'm strapping in for like 5 hours and 11-14 innings.
Kyle bunting, Tony stealing, Tseng hitting, foul balls, swinging bunts...Mets pitcher is diving everywhere. Wow. Baseball.
This might be the most compelling game I've watched since game 7.

@itstaiki Can you think of a better first pitch? The other good ones are outtakes and nutshots. So I guess they are patriotic in a different way.
@jjruns seriously, he could not have done it better. Best 1st pitch of all time?
@itstaiki So cool, thanks for reminding me with this post!
