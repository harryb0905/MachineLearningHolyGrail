@hseprofesional jan 5th. Should be a doozy
@JosHill75 exactly!
@Mr_Ogasm nice!!! Keep it going bro
@kawiracing bingo. If someone else would've saw it, they would've said the same thing. I just thought it was strange that's all. All good
@JosHill75 don't agree with me, they will give you hate also lol. I love it
@pulpmx @chuckt644 still doesn't explain why it only happen one time. Oh we'll that's why I don't talk Steve lol
I don't buy into the Monster put the event on so the monster riders gate fell first. Yea I'm sure they really wanted to pay that mill.
@pulpmx slower only n that race. Even after they fixed it the 1st race the gates fell at the same time. Every race except 4 the 2nd was fine
@thall767 if that was the case then it would've happen every race. It only happens once. Not saying it was fixed, but it's def strange
No both gates dropped. Just the one on the bottom dropped later then the one on the top. It was the first race that one gate didn't drop.
Back on the plane to Ca. Hopefully there isn't any Halloween ghost up here flying my jet. Could get weird!
I laughed at KG's cold shoulder to Ray Allen. Weren't the boys last season lol? Sports will make you hate your best friend &amp; love your enemy
@MF746 what upset you worse? Wishing u could be me or knowing that you'll never be me? Focus on your own life... If you have one! #doubtit
NBA baby! Between FBS, NFL &amp; NBA it's a lot happening on Tv now.
@theyoungjayy working on something for you guys
@spence_hill11 that was a fun race
@RichardFla22 wouldn't consider it a break but like the song says... I'm going back to Cali
@B3autifulDzastR it's like going to work everyday. Most jobs won't allow you to bring them to work. Just need 2 enjoy the time u do see them
Feels good to be home. Even if its only for 2 days.
@pulpmx while in the USA 0. While in Canada 10 bc they won't have sports on tv. All they do is show hockey up there. Serious Blackout
USC must be thinking Why Reggie? K-State I want to believe but wins over TX, WV? OSU vs Penn state= the battle of the ineligibles.
Norte Dame is 4real. Oregon is the most exciting team 2 watch. Bama can beat half the NFL teams. Anyone except Bama can lose in the SEC.
Happy Bday little brother. @Mookie_37
Where's the best spot to chill at in brazil? Always wanted to go
Had an off day after a busy week of riding, so played golf with my homies @J_Malott &amp; @jrado1. Good time http://t.co/IPsKgqxQ

That was good stuff! Can't wait to mix it up with these guys. Congrats J.B
Now it gets interesting!
@steventate017 no trouble at all. I trust that they wouldn't let that happen.
@pulpmx that's why you don't give pops a headset!
@pulpmx watching it on Tv so it looks cool from here lol. Cool concept tho
That was exciting.
The kids on the minis are killing it!
Was that the joker lane lol? Talking about getting the nerves up for nothing. I thought the my tv froze up.
@Crayz75 love Vegas. Just not even close to being healthy yet. Otherwise I'll be there battling it out. But I will be soon! #13sxmx

Watching Chargers vs Broncos &amp; not gonna lie, I thought Denver would be better then they are. Still along ways to go. Got faith in Peyton
Doesn't look like I'll be at MC. Not going to rush it. Have a goal &amp; a plan &amp; we're sticking to it. A goal without a plan is just a wish!

Man the eagles gotta get Vick some protection in the pocket. Oh and he needs to hold onto the ball.
@CMA671 well atleast they went out playing a ranked team. FSU lost to a good but not great team. Well they might be great now lol
@merc365 very good helmet. I designed that thing from ground up
Wow FSU just blew it.
Doing more studying. Damn that bike was working good that 2nd moto. There's not a day that goes by that I do http://t.co/fXc6Vk84
Looks like that FSU vs FU game will be huge this year if they both stay undefeated til then.
Lsu vs Uf= a typical SEC defensive  game.

Congrats to AC, Kroc &amp; JH for great performances. US did their best but Europe had plenty of motivation this year. Congrats Germany &amp; Co
I do believe that Antonio Cairoli is the fastest guy over there now. If he shows up, its a wrap! But then again that's why we race the race
We might not win a moto but like I said before I don't believe we need to, we have a good team. All 2's is all we need to retain our trophy.
Everyone is worried that U.S wont win the mxdn, but the race is based on a team event. We have the best TEAM, so with that i think we'll win
Watching avengers for the first time. I hope it's good otherwise goodnight lol
I've learned that ppl will forget what u said, ppl will forget what u did, but ppl will never forget how u made them feel. Let's Stay Classy

Been a long week with labor day on Monday. PGA, football &amp; add that along with 2/4 wheel racing, this weekend is setting up to be a classic!
Happy Labor day everyone.
Sec is strong as always but maybe USC or Oregon can step up and play them tough. All I know is the Ducks kill it with their uniforms
@YZGeorge119 they just got slaughtered by Bama. But it's the beginning so maybe they can recover.

It's better to be hated for what you are then to be loved for what you're not. Do what's right &amp; heck with the popularity contest!
Even a mistake may turn out to be the one thing necessary to a worthwhile achievement.
People can be more forgiving than you can imagine. But you have to forgive yourself. Let go of what's bitter and move on. Bc

Watched Act of Valor again. I want to go on aircraft carrier &amp; meet those guys. Always been honored to meet some of these guys 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
My prediction will be wrong with OKC in 6 but can't say I'm mad. Heat brought it tonight.
Now this is a game!
I know the movie immortals has been around awhile but I just finished watching it again. Those who have seen it, did you like it?
Don't some of u realize that there are enough people to hate in the world already without u putting in so much effort to give us more?
@nano_galarza ummm this sat? Must be a real die hard follower to the series. Macaroni
Who you got? OKC or Heat. Big game for OKC so I'm going with them for a win tonight.
@kparnell_ haha I know those are the good ones
@OrigStella1999 haha I bet. I've heard stories
Ok folks it's almost game time, I'll leave u with these words 4 now. Never do anything that you wouldn't want to explain to the paramedics.
@927bailey Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain.
Nice! About 75% got it right. Throw it up in the air.

It's not what we wanted but after 6 laps of the 1st moto I knew I was in trouble when I was trying to hang on with one arm. That's no fun
But at the end I just couldn't do it anymore. I really wanna thank my team &amp; fans for being there thru these couple of weeks.
Gave it all I had 2day but I couldn't hold on anymore. I'm actually surprise I made it thru the 1st moto but I had to try. I tried my best..

“@StayReckLess25: @js7 Don't Even Worry About It You Have True Fans Behind You! Your MY Hero&lt;3” thank you!! As far as that other clown. 😝✊
@mx49dad @jasonweigandt I agree with the track layouts. Go back 2 the late 90's & early 2000 tracks. More jumps but slower tracks
Feld & Dirtworks will do about anything we ask them, so it has to be up to us to let them know what needs to be changed for the better
@JasonWeigandt it's not anyone's fault, we just need to make it safer for the guy who wins & the guy who gets last. We're all 1 big family
@JasonWeigandt exactly! Its like any safety instruments on a airplane. Someone had 2 crash in order 2 make it safer for the nxt 1 inline
Fellow rider Trey & Ryan get landed on in La said Hey I got the holeshot so I'm good it doesn't matter? If U race, U kno that feeling of OMG
Some of U are Saying i need to pull the holeshot & not worry about it. Ur rite I should but U don't think any rider that watched thier.....
I Feel 4 the safety of riders, if the triple is within the 1st 3 lanes of the start, it should be mandatory 2 roll the 1st lap! Remember LA?
Has anyone seen the Atlanta Track map? Well that Triple out the 2nd corner looks so fun especially mid-pack off the start. #Nogood
@RickyCarmichael is it watts lol. Young man, pls go back to America haha

For some reason when it rains in Ca it seems like the world is shut down. Well especially when ur only out here to ride lol
Can you name a movie where Cuba Gooding Jr hasn't cried in? Every movie he's ever played in, he's cried in it also. Guy knows how to act lol

@Jwillz44  100% correct!
But again thx for the support! Means alot everyone. Talk to you guys tmrw. Night!
Dude got lucky bc my dad rather watch his son race then punch dude in the face bc he's dumb. Also he couldn't get 2 him bc where he was lol
I understand everyone has their favorite riders but seriously to spit on someone is the worst thing you can do to someone. It's degrading!
Thx everyone & I'll tell pops what you guys said. What happen in southwick to my mom & this has been probably the lowest points of my career
Besides that I count my blessing bc that crash was a bad one & it could've been alot worse. Thx to the team & all the fans 4 the love today.
Say want about me but when u put my family in harm bc u are a loser, well ur messing with the wrong person. Karma sucks & it'll find U!
This idiot is lucky he was in a high spot to where we couldn't get to him really quick then this punk ran off. I mean seriously, Spitting?
Also I had some bad things done to me & said 2 my family but some Ass in the stands took it to another level 2nite. This guy spit on my dad!

Ok im going to brainstorm some ideals on the jerseys but I need your help. So far dressing up is the leader for the jersey give-away.
@JredX122 oooo now that's worth 2 jerseys
@jamesecox50 now that would def get you a jersey.
@danny_sim86 I like it but Rossi my boy so I don't wanna steal his ideal.
@Jordan_Adams21 I'll prob hit them then I'll be pissed at myself hahaha
“@DaniFrench: @js7 thank you for taking the time to say that you brought a smile to my sons face #goodluckfornextseason” No Problem
@RUN__BMC now that's a good ideal!!!
@jezaniah4  @63chill I feel like with T shirts, you'll be competing against to many people since its easier to make besides banners?
@BenKurtz240 yea that's why we should come up with something new. Ideals?
@Leemorgan32 hahaha
I feel like besides the dinners I'm doing, I still want 2 connect with my biggest fans so the banner ideal was awesome but hard 4 u to bring
Last year we had a prob with security not letting the JS banners in at each SX. Any ideals on what we could do 4 2012 instead of banners?
@mx_phreek absolutely
@JesusTheCarp @hodgieracing amen to that
“@DaniFrench: @js7 hope you don't have our bad luck we woke this morning to find our bikes had been stolen #brokenhearted14yearold” so sorry
@jacobkavanagh 2 stroke is cheaper on the wallet when it breaks but a 4 stroke is a better racing motorcycle. But heck what do I kno lol
I would give a u a look but it's not completely done yet. I've been around motorcycles my whole life and even I will stand proud nxt week...
