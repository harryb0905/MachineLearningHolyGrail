@janewiedlin @spookperson It improved my day by 92%!
As I said before, I'm at https://t.co/KyYRI0iYzf and https://t.co/OJ6k9iMrtu as wilw. I'm itswilwheaton at Instagram and Facebook, and wilwheaton at Tumblr. I'm still around, if you care about that. I just won't be here. Thanks for listening, and be kind to each other. üôÇ 6/end
I am not under any false impressions about this effort. It probably won't make a difference at all. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying, and it doesn't mean that our lives won't be improved by removing this toxicity from our lives, even if it's just temporary. 5/
I don't want to be part of what Twitter has become. I hope that if enough of us deactivate, whoever is leading Twitter (it sure as hell isn't Jack) will take meaningful steps to address and curtail the abuse, misinformation, and harassment that are currently its primary use. 4/
Early on, people like me helped Twitter grow and flourish. I'm proud of that, and I don't regret it. But Twitter has lost its way, because it has terrible leadership that tolerates and encourages bigotry, abuse, harassment, and the deliberate  spreading of misinformation. 3/
As I said yesterday: no judgment. If you're not into this effort, that's totally cool. Live your best life, and spend time here if it makes you happy. It doesn't make me happy, and I feel that Twitter, right now, does more harm than good. 2/
I've been here since the very beginning. Tomorrow, I'm deactivating my Twitter. I invite you to join me, for a day, a week, a month, whatever works for you, because you deserve better than the toxic, hateful, abusive environment @jack has encouraged Twitter to become. 1/ https://t.co/i4B2fSlDwW

Us: Please enforce your TOS, and kick the Nazis off Twitter. Twitter: We hear you. Now, HOW ABOUT ... we force you to see people you don't want to see in your timeline, instead?! WON'T THAT BE GREAT! Us: No. Twitter: ROUNDED CORNERS! LOOK AT THEM!! EH?! EH?!
@MEPFuller His hands are, like, really tied. He just feels awful about it, and it's deeply troubling that he just can't do anything, because if he could, he TOTALLY would. That's what's so troubling about it.
@MEPFuller And he's really, really, super duper, totally troubled. It's really important that you know how troubled he is. Shucks, he's so troubled, he just doesn't know what to do with himself. on account of how troubled he is.

@AlexPlayerofgam This is awesome, and it's illustrative of how great Twitter *can* be, *should* be, and *would* be, if it had real leadership.
I feel like it's implied, but just to be clear: live your best life! If #DeactiDay isn't your jam, that's cool! No judgment! Do what makes you happy! I think most of you get that, but some replies are ... well, sort of supporting my reasons for leaving this network. So. Yeah.
Twitter is broken. You deserve better than an app that tolerates and welcomes the spreading of abuse and misinformation. Being part of this is not doing us any good.

@lammey_jen When I took Twitter off my phone several months ago, I reminded myself that if anything *truly* important happens, I'll get a news alert from a trusted source. It took away a lot of that anxiety I had.

@Greyson2020 @shannoncoulter He's a despicable person who does despicable things, using Twitter to attack and harm people. He consistently breaks Twitter's TOS. If he wasn't making Twitter money, they would have banned him by now. I won't be part of a site that lets him spew his hate and lies.
Such incredibly great company you keep, @jack. https://t.co/cfQmOlPrBy

@alpzazca Oh hey I just did, and it doesn't say anything about private businesses enforcing its TOS consistently and evenly. It's pretty clear about government, though. Give it a look! It's really well-written.
@Greyson2020 @shannoncoulter Spectacular job missing the point, sir.
Thanks for listening. If you just can't live without my dumb jokes, #Resistance posts, and pictures of my pets, I'll still be at Instagram and Facebook (itswilwheaton) , at https://t.co/KyYRI0iYzf (wilw), https://t.co/kxEvsmmhX6 and, of course, https://t.co/Z9r5LiKE0U.  8/end https://t.co/8U0jUObUsO
So a bunch of us are hoping that Twitter will take Alex Jones' hate and cruelty and flaunting of Twitter's own TOS seriously, and ban him. If you want to join us, @shannoncoulter has made it really easy to take some action: https://t.co/qNlEXMkDFG 7/
Twitter used to be fun. It was a potential force for good in the world, but it's become the social network equivalent of that cool punk club that was taken over by skinheads, and I don't want to be part of it any more. 6/
Twitter is a private business and can decide who and what it promotes and enables. There are certain things that just should be outside the bounds of civil society. Attacking parents whose children were murdered should be one of those things. 5/
I'm just posting this here for the few of you who care: I'm planning to sign out and stay signed out unless and until Twitter follows the leadership of other social networks, and says enough is enough to Alex Jones and people like him. 4/
The Alex Jones thing is the last straw for me. Every other social network has rightfully removed that awful man's ability to use their platform to spew his hate, to attack and hurt people like the Sandy Hook parents, except Twitter. Why? I believe it's a failure of leadership. 3/
It's a real shame that Twitter's leadership doesn't seem to care about the hateful people it empowers, and enforces its own TOS so unevenly, giving preferential treatment to high profile people like Alex Jones, who have *clearly* broken that same TOS. 2/
Logged out on Friday, and spent the whole weekend being present with my family, creating art I care about, pretending to be an adult, and not having the angry hate machine buzzing in my pocket. My small experiment says life is better without Twitter. 1/
@UnburntWitch Sign me up!
I have not looked at Twitter since ... Sunday? Maybe early Monday morning? And I had a *great* week. Twitter has become terrible, and my life is better without it. Maybe yours will be, too. Try cutting it out, entirely, just for the weekend. We'll talk about it Monday.

This really brought out the screeching idiocy of the stupidsphere. Gosh, I wonder why.
It's pretty simple: Republican-controlled states require ID to vote, narrow the acceptable forms of ID, then prevent voters who live in largely-minority and low-income areas from getting that ID. VOILA! Democratic votes are suppressed!
Voter ID is not fundamental to election security. Requiring ID to vote only achieves voter suppression, almost exclusively poor people and people of color, which is exactly why the GOP votes down money to *really* secure elections, while supporting voter ID.
@BadAstronomer Take your goddamn trophy and get out.
Republicans continue to vote against protecting the integrity of our elections, and it's only logical to presume that they are counting on election interference to help them win elections they would otherwise lose.
@JohnRossBowie I know you're out of the country being a fancy TV star and everything, so you may have missed the news that the Mets lost 25-4 yesterday. As your friend, I have a responsibility to make sure you know that, and the Mets are now 44-60 on the year.

Dog: LET ME GO OUTSIDE. Me: It's over 100 out. You don't want to be out there. Dog: OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR. Me: You have a dog door. Dog: *blank look* Me: *sighs* *opens door* Dog: UGH TOO HOT. Me: I tried to tell you. Dog: OPEN THE DOOR SO I CAN GO OUTSIDE.
I miss when Twitter was stuff like this. https://t.co/KpFuGe3kza
#SaveMagnoliaPark because it's the heart and soul of Burbank. We don't need to add even more %$#@ing big box and chain stores, especially at the expense of indie stores that are owned by people who actually live in our community. https://t.co/6P28JeHTOE

@fly72 This may be peak whataboutism.
@billprady If SAG-AFTRA and WGA can actually get their shit together long enough to work on a common cause, I will have the biggest party in the history of life.

Shoutout to everyone braving #SDCC this weekend. I sincerely hope y'all are having as much fun being there as I am having staying home. If you see any of my friends, tell them I said hi!

Good night, nerds. https://t.co/d21VYvZMdo
@AnneWheaton I feel like you're subtweeting Arthur, just because he does what he pleases.
There is so much whataboutism in my mentions, rather than reply to them all, I'm just going to say: I need you to take your whataboutism, and shove it way way way way up inside your butthole. Just shove it right in there. Good job! Thank you so much!
@karajanae @DoorDash Maybe they don't understand the concept of "dash" the way we do.
@alanbnogueira This is literally the definition of whataboutism.
@Stonekettle @AnneWheaton Goddammit.
@alanbnogueira Take your whataboutism someplace else.
The fact that the President of the United States made secret agreements with Putin, and refuses to tell the citizens of this country and other elected officials what they are, should end his presidency immediately. We are not Trump's subjects. This is not a monarchy. https://t.co/fb9zaAAOlN
@ChuckWendig Thank you, sir. Your musings on writing were very helpful to me while I did this. Now the TERRIBLE CRUSHING FEAR THAT IT IS TERRIBLE will set up shop in my brainmeats for a little while, and that's gonna be FUUUUUNNNNN.
@ChuckWendig It doesn't feel finished, is the thing.
Remember, if the Electoral College functioned as it was intended to by the people who created it (and not the modern day Republicans who have corrupted and exploited it to subvert the popular vote), none of this would be happening right now. #NationalPopularVoteNow
@MaryRobinette Thank you! And thank you for your help you gave me with your first draft notes!
@Spacekatgal Your'e so kind. I will absolutely be doing the audiobook!
@TeenTitansMovie @tarastrong OMG I THINK I SEE AQUALAD BEHIND RAVEN!!!
@laurenlapkus burn it all down
@ogw_iii It simultaneously feels like it is, and it isn't.
@acarboni I'll strike out one word from the copy I give you, but I'm leaving @jayzombies' copy intact.
@pdxposhy @xeni It's true and you know it.
I just turned in the final draft of my novel, All We Ever Wanted Was Everything, to my editor. Final word count of the draft is 78504. I feel like I should be celebrating, but I know that there's still a ways to go before it's ready to be published.
@xeni Also, young children are absolute shit at making honey.
@wilw_ebooks Live your best life, bot.
@mimi78 @AnneWheaton NO.
@JApker Are ... are you being serious right now? You're doing a bit, right? Like a parody of a MAGA troll, right?

The wishes of their constituents are extremely clear, yet Collins and Murkowski have *always* made noises and furrowed their brows about protecting women's rights, before they *consistently* vote against them. We have receipts, y'all. https://t.co/QqgxDhMxGd
Good night, nerds. https://t.co/3enauQjzP5
I have to say, though, that it's refreshing to see some banal stupidity, instead of the virulent racism and misogyny that most of the MAGA crowd vomits up at me.
This controversial opinion (OMG governments should work for their citizens and not be used as a tool to make rich people even richer at the expense of the majority!) really brought out the stupid in some people. Keep fucking that chicken, you guys!
@MerlinTW OMG you are serious. So I'm gonna need you to take your whataboutism and shove it way way way up inside your butthole. Thanks so much!
@MerlinTW are ... are you serious?
@deannhaugen @AnneWheaton NO.
@UnburntWitch Get hooked up with @feliciaday. She knows where all the fun stuff is happening. And because it's your first: be prepared for it to take 4x as long as you think to get anywhere.
Say it with me: if the United States can afford to give a billion dollars in tax breaks to corporations who just buy back their own stock and enrich their executives, the United States can provide fully-funded health care for veterans (and all Americans). https://t.co/FU3iHSmSPl
@LydiaHearst @SYFY @znation @KellitaSmith1 @KeithAllanDuh @hodgmahal @TheOnlyDJQualls CONGRATULATIONS!!! I know how much you love this show, and how long you've wanted to be part of it. I'm so excited for you!!

@bonniegrrl @AnneWheaton I can't believe I was ever as fat as I am in this gif. Dang, now I'm actually proud of the work I've done to get into shape.
@Yorkshireman01 You could try not insulting someone who is having fun and enjoying their downtime between jobs.
@joe_j42 After over 130 hours in the wasteland, I have concluded that it is not possible to even wound, much less kill, a Deathclaw.
@JesseHeinig Thank you for your advice! I chose NV because I really wanted the RP experience more than anything else. And thank you for your work! I've been a fan since Fallout 2 on an ancient PC in the 90s.
My character is named Marlowe, and she loves to blow your head off with her shotgun. Geckos tremble before her, and Radscorpions whisper her name to Bloatflies to scare their children on dark nights.
I have been following the dudes who shot me, I've made mortal enemies of the Powder Gangers, put NCR in charge of Primm (because the sheriff went hostile on me and I had to shoot him), and am heading into Novac.
For those of you who need closure: I ended up doing New Vegas. I played for SIX HOURS last night because I'm an adult. I'm following the main story as best as I can, and already met NPCs I never met before, in over 100 hours of play.
Has anyone checked in with Hari Seldon today?

Two days ago, a Nazi propagandist called for his followers to murder journalists. For two years, the president has repeatedly attacked the press as an enemy of the people. Today, a gunman murdered five people in a newsroom. These events are all connected.

So would you kindly fuck off, you self-appointed arbiters of "civility", and may the people you're comforting never have a single moment's peace in their lives, for enabling and supporting the most despicable, wannabe autocrat this country has ever vomited up onto the earth.
"Oh no! Someone was MEAN to me! In a RESTAURANT! Now I'll have to go to a different restaurant and think about what new fancy lies I'll tell tomorrow, in service of a racist, misogynist, globally-despised wannabe autocrat." Fuck off.
And, honestly, if the worst consequence a rich and powerful person gets for enabling Fascists and normalizing Nazis is that they can't peacefully dine out in a restaurant while others suffer because of them? They're getting off REALLY FUCKING EASY.
Shut the fuck up with your handwringing and pearl-clutching about civility. You don't get to take a shit in the middle of my living room and then complain that I'm a bad host when I throw you out of my house.
@Mike_Eagle Okay, I've thought about this way too much, and I've decided that it has to be an art installation that is commentary on the ridiculousness of social media influencer culture. In that context, I love it. But if I'm wrong, burn the world down.
@OraclesDoExist @Mike_Eagle Add in some hookers and blackjack, and you'll have something.

@BigJoeRossi69 @jimmykimmel These families have fled violence and war in their home countries. They are seeking asylum in America, which is NOT CRIMINAL YOU STUPID FUCK. Your stunning lack of empathy and compassion is sickening.
@MFairbanksImage "It started under Obama" is a lie. The Obama administration did not separate families, and it certainly didn't kidnap children after deporting their parents.
@ThomasWestbro @SHammondTodd Keep lying to yourself and believing that you have a "huge heart" while you have no empathy or compassion for your fellow humans who have come to America to escape violence in their home countries. I hope you can get the help you need to overcome your selfishness.

@cdnbeer @BhanLiz Well, I'd tell you, but it's not the end of the world.
@warlock12uk @Theremina I was just at a con, and Steranko was there, but I was so busy I never got to meet him. It's one of the great missed connections of my life.
@chrislhayes YA THINK
@ChelseaClinton It happened again! I'm gonna catch 'em all!
@ChelseaClinton It finally happened! Someone who was terrible to you was already blocked by me! I feel like I caught the worst Pokemon of all.
@pattonoswalt Not with that attitude, mister.
And he is taking down an entire nation with him, enabled and encouraged by a corrupt and rotten congressional majority that puts their temporary power and ambitions ahead of their oaths of office. None of this is possible if congress does its constitutional duty. https://t.co/7wliLYyCeQ

@Dreakon @danadearmond We're friends, so we have a special shorthand that only we understand.
@vitor_tonini Tumblr has a more seamless interface for sharing and resharing things. It has a simple UI and it doesn't try to be another blogging platform the way Medium does. It's good for quick things, pictures, and quotes. WordPress powers my blog.
@amahnke Washing our clothes used to take an entire day, but now we can do our entire wardrobe in a few hours.   For some people, though, it isn't as simple or as safe as it should be. For some people, washing clothes is deliciously dangerous.   I'm Wil Wheaton, and this ... is Lore.

@veg_ragabash @steve_shives @Twitter They've been polluting my timeline all day.
@Jaegersmomma I'm sure he has. But to act like his party has suddenly just begun appealing to racism, the Confederacy, and white nationalism is just utterly disingenuous.
@hops_and_smoke I have one. It's weird because I use Cloudflare. I'll talk to Mysterious Kevin about helping me make sure it's all up to date.
@amahnke I am so into this.

@OzOlvera I quit drinking two years ago, and haven't brewed since then. I still have all my gear, in case I change my mind, or if a friend wants to make something together, but I mostly make sourdough bread now, with the same skills I learned from homebrewing.
@HolbertNeil I had one bag of that brand about a year ago, and I have never gone back to any other so-called gummy bears. Black Forest FTW.
@amahnke This world does not deserve you.
@wilw_ebooks You and me both, bot.

@Jay_White0509 I can not eat gummy bears without thinking of this scene.
UPDATE: I have eaten the rest of the bag of gummy bears. They all had the appropriate gummy bear flavours in them. I REGRET NOTHING.
@jay_clementi OMG that's so clever. I love it.
@NoraReed @AmarandAgasi I'm totally willing to get a list of transpeople who were inadvertently added to my list, and go through by hand to remove and unblock them all. I am not antitrans at all, and I feel terrible that I unintentionally spread that mass blocking.

@BhanLiz It's Canadian, and I'm practicing for when I flee North and request asylum from Nazi America.
@AmarandAgasi @NoraReed That's correct. I've been trying ever since to clean up the list, but I don't know how to find a master list of unfairly blocked accounts to remove. That's why I stopped sharing my list.
According to my tastebuds, this gummy bear I talked myself out of and then back into eating is the new, improved, dish soap flavour. And before you ask: I'm still not sharing my gummy bears with anyone.
@Stacemonger Thank you!
@Dean_burrito83 My grandmothers have both been dead for decades.
@NoraReed @AmarandAgasi This is a fair criticism. I've done my best to clean up the false positives on my list that happened as a result, and stopped sharing my list until I could do that. ANy suggestions to correct that mistake would be welcomed.
@PHedgehog Fair.
@WildWiredWeasel @waltshaub You've created a false choice. Trump got nothing and gave Kim everything. NK has made this promise for decades and always breaks it. The NK people live in a national gulag, and Trump did not discuss human rights, at all. Can't end evil when you don't discuss evil.
regarding blocklists, trolls, twitter's systemic inaction, and the responsibility of wielding great power https://t.co/teTmJaXrlb https://t.co/XD9RijNL9f
@bdgrabinski He wants us to believe that his dick is big enough for him to keep stepping on it.
@polipi17 @Icyrice43 @CherryAnnWilli4 @mehdirhasan Also, Electoral College was established to give outsized representation and power to slave-owning states. It's not only anti-democratic, it's fundamentally racist.
@Phoebe_Is_Bored @AndyDoppler When that person is the CEO of Twitter, yes. Yes, I do believe it is appropriate to blame him for doing nothing in his position of leadership to address the systemic and rampant abuse and toxicity on the platform he is supposed to manage.
@Kronk3r I can do whatever I want and need to do. Nobody is entitled to my time and attention. This is my social media account, and I get to decide what that means.
@brianjayjones You're very kind. I like this perspective, and it makes me feel like I should do my best to do something awesome with the privilege I have.
@AndyDoppler I do! I've been on Twitter so long, I remember when it wasn't a trash fire and we could actually have meaningful and fun communications here. It's a hard habit to break, even if it's a really terrible platform under Jack's failure of leadership.
So maybe we can try to remember that Twitter is fickle, with great power comes great responsibility, and it's probably a good idea to remember that there are real people on the other side of your screen. Try not to be a dick to them (I do not always succeed in that effort).
My Twitter experience last week: Thank you for sharing your experiences living with mental illness. You saved my life. My Twitter experience this week: LOL WHY U BLOK THIS YOUTUBER YOU FAGGOT GO KILL YOURSELF MEME MEME MEME. 2018 is a real rollercoaster.
@iCeleste_14 @lainaamiller @DanniRyn @LordMinion777 @Jack_Septic_Eye Months ago, a toxic youtube personality with a large following attacked me. They probably follow him and got caught up in a mass block I had to use to detoxify my timeline. Again, it's laughably easy to reach out to me privately to ask what's up. This all could have been avoided.
In just ten tweets, @waltshaub breaks down the destruction Trump and his enablers have wrought on what was, until January 2017, the greatest country in the world, which drew the best and brightest, as well as the most vulnerable, from across the globe to live and prosper here. https://t.co/ou6RmcZxU2
@iCeleste_14 @lainaamiller @DanniRyn @LordMinion777 @Jack_Septic_Eye That's fair. We are not responsible for everyone who follows us. Allow me an observation: Right now, in 2018, on Twitter, I don't know how they could sincerely be surprised by what they ended up instigating. With great power, as the saying goes, and all that.
@YuriLowenthal ENCHANTMENT!

@lainaamiller @DanniRyn @LordMinion777 @Jack_Septic_Eye Well, based on this experience I've had today, the actions of their followers/fans do not reflect well on them, at all. They may want to ask themselves why they attracted so many people they would be embarrassed to be associated with.
@stevenspohn I believe you, and we can't be held accountable for everyone who follow us. The thing is, it would have been painfully easy to reach out to me directly and ask if it was intentional. Instead, he unleashed a mob on me.
@cammyhenryy I've talked about this extensively. The short answer is: because Twitter is a garbage fire and I have to use blunt and clumsy tools to make up for the lack of official action to keep shitty people out of my timeline. And nobody is entitled to my time and attention.
@SallyDeal4 @IndivisibleVent Done and done. Sorry about that. I have to use big, clumsy, blunt instruments in an effort to make Twitter usable, and false positives happen.
@JamesGunn Well, I know what I'm watching tonight.
@SamiMiniCosplay @bigbangtheory @IndyPopCon Your cosplay and your joyful roller skating made my convention so much better! Don't forget to be awesome!!
Nothing makes me think "I didn't mean to block this person, but I'm glad I did" quite like that person trying to flood my mentions with their followers calling me names and demanding that I unblock them. Grow up.

@aussiastronomer Credit for that perfect point goes to @hardwick. I just reposted his insights on my Instagram, because he said everything I wanted to say.
I didn't know Bourdain, and I hadn't watched much of his work. I liked what I saw when I did, but I didn't go out of my way to see his shows. Still, his death is hitting me really, really hard for some reason. Depression doesn't care who it hurts. Please take care of yourselves.

@hijinksensue @RobDenBleyker The rights holders to the name SEXWORLD approve all of these titles, and continue to insist on all caps.
@amahnke @DanaSchwartzzz @ChuckWendig @bonniegrrl Me too. And I started the damn thing.
@hijinksensue @RobDenBleyker Please ensure that the new, approved title is always presented in all caps. This is very important. Thank you for your kind attention.
@hijinksensue @RobDenBleyker I'm afraid that Sexworld is an actual 1970s porno movie, and as the self-appointed legal representative of the rights holders, I insist you change the name of your podcast to SEXTOWN: MUSINGS ON THE VARIOUS ROBO-HUMPINGS OF DIGITAL COWBOYS AND REGULAR BOYS (AND GIRLS!) ALIKE.
@danidoodles8 @amandatheshark Not only will I never forget, I will always be reminded of how legit Amanda's DM screen is when I look at my own, dumb, boring, off-the-shelf "official" DM screen.
So go do the thing, my fellow creators! It doesn't have to be perfect when we start it (and it probably won't be unless you're @neilhimself !) but we can work on it until it's as good as we can make it, and then ... BAM! You made a thing where there wasn't a thing before.
As bad as it feels to sit there in the dog fart of Impostor Syndrome, it feels even better to get to the end of a day's work, and feel that excitement to get back to work the next day, because you want to tell more of the story. It's awesome, because you earned it.
I'm just adding this for my fellow Impostor Syndromers (hi @bonniegrrl !), to remind us all that when we feel like we can't do the thing, and when we feel like Carrie's mom is screaming "THEY'RE ALL GONNA LAUGH AT YOU," it's our dumb brains fucking with us. We can do the thing!
Today was one of those days where I felt like a big dumb imposter a lot of the time, but I refused to give up, pushed through it, and got a lot of stuff written that I don't hate. Most importantly, I'm SUPER excited to get back to work on this tomorrow.

@acarboni Sounds like ... WE NEED TO DO A PODCAST ABOUT IT! QUICK! TO THE PODCASTOMOBILE!!!
@DFTBArecords @hankgreen Hard pass.
@AJ_Jones_Author @acarboni I agree. We have to stop giving toxic men rhetorical cover by using the blanket term "fans", because it lets the toxic men off the hook and perpetuates a culture that needs to change.
2783 words (70309 total) on the rewrite of All We Ever Wanted Was Everything. I wrote a new opening scene, based on feedback from early readers, to frame the narrative more clearly. It was really challenging to find the words, but I did, and I‚Äôm happy with what I came up with.
@taopauly @PeachesNovel I was like "It's 6/6" and then I looked at the clock and felt dumb.
@acarboni I say this respectfully and with tremendous affection for you, Anthony: it isn't "a portion of the Star Wars fandom" it's "toxic men who claim ownership of Star Wars for themselves to the exclusion of everyone else."

@TheRensie @lunabubbalou No doubt.

@lunabubbalou They are PHENOMENALLY talented, but the NHL structured the draft in a way that pretty much guaranteed the team would be this strong. That's never happened in an expansion draft before, and it's grossly unfair to the rest of the league. (also, go kings)
@BeanieJedi33 I'm an anybody-but-Vegas fan.

@Grow_a_Perry @SanbornMark This is not true. You have been lied to and you do not have your facts straight, at all. Family separation at the border is a new policy that was instituted by Trump and Sessions.
@SedanTaboos Take your whataboutism someplace else.
I'll use small words so you can follow along: taking children away from their parents, who have come to America in an effort to escape violence, is morally wrong. If you can't understand that, you're either quite stupid or not even trying. In either case, please find a brick wall https://t.co/fApJQr9NXp

@NoPaint_NoGaint Yeah, obviously. Punch all the Nazis.
Be kind. Like, make an honest and concerted effort to be kind, and not just to me. Be kind whenever you have the opportunity. Small acts of kindness have HUGE effects on people, and they spread like ripples in a pond. Kindness inspires kindness. https://t.co/dCVbPd9KgB
This sort of thing (and I'm highlighting these examples as a teachable moment) is like saying to a person "You deserve cancer" or "You deserve diabetes". It's so needlessly cruel, and though I can shrug it off, it can really hurt a person who is in crisis. Don't do this. https://t.co/OKcovj8hDc

This is the sort of thing a shitty person says to someone who lives with mental illness. Saying shitty things like this just helps perpetuate the stigma against folks with Depression, and can have real consequences that hurt people. Don't be a shitty person like this guy. https://t.co/7VPH3FkI0m

@chrislhayes 90% of Canadians live within 100 miles of our border, Chris. If that's not a potential invasion force, I don't know what is.
@shownotfound @mikeyface What if we watched an old terrible TV show and then talked about it?
@mikeyface I was killed by Tanks many times today while I was trying to save your dumb ass that kept trying to walk LITERALLY RIGHT INTO A HULK.
@BadAstronomer @jessphoenix2018 Phil! Mind your manners! Be gneiss.
@BadAstronomer No way. Cosby's a person of color, and if Trump is consistent about one thing, it's hating people of color.
@jeff_stacey @DDWRTNetworking That was my first thought, but my hardware isn't supported.
"Yeah, I have a question. Why did the last human family in Robotron go to the one place that's literally swarming with robots trying to kill them? Like, there wasn't a SINGLE other place for them to go?"  "I meant did you have any questions about our menu, sir."
@JessicaChobot The fuck.
Yes, and before you ask, I also rerouted power from nonessential systems to emit an inverse neutrino pulse through the router's primary induction matrix. THIS IS NOT MY FIRST RODEO, PEOPLE. https://t.co/wUMOIcqMI7
Y'all are like "did you reverse the polarity" like that isn't the FIRST thing I do when I run into a hardware problem.
@BGencarelle I have old hardware that needs b/g to see the SSID. I can switch it back to mixed after. It's incredibly stupid in every respect.
@evanmauerbach Sadly, it is not. That was my first thought for a fix.
Oh I ran out of characters to also say thank you to those of you who offered tech support suggestions and help. I'm also grateful that I can spend an entire Friday on something dumb like this, because I have an obnoxiously privileged life.
UPDATE: I have wasted nearly an entire day trying to get this dumb router to let me do a simple thing. I could have hit my face with a fish and it would have been as useful. Now to waste the rest of the day researching replacement hardware.

@AmarandAgasi It seems like a good match for someone who wants to turn it on and forget about it. I usually like doing things that way, but I need the option to open it up and access more granular settings. It's frustrating that Linksys won't let me.
@fanemerald @Linksys This seems like a really good idea.
@claybar57 @Linksys A+++ work. Extra points for the comma usage.
@plaidomatic Yeah I'm trying to connect a device that can only see the SSID if it's b/g only. I need to temporarily switch from mixed to b/g, and I can't find a way to do that. It's super frustrating.
@SturmB @wirecutter This is a great resource. Thank you.
Oops. I'm a dummy. I meant change from mixed to only b/g. I've tried the CA thing, turning off password entirely, and yelling at the router. Nothing works. So what's a good home mesh wifi solution that isn't crippled garbage like this one?
@kennet__ @Linksys I tried that, and it didn't give me access. It's so frustrating when a company decides that they're going to limit hardware functionality because they know best.
@DAmunrud @Linksys Maybe it's b/g? I need to change it to attach an older device to my network.
Dumb tech support question: I need to change the wireless mode on my @Linksys #velop from mixed to only a/b. The app and web interface only allow me to select mixed. Has anyone solved this stupid crippling of the device? Am I missing something?
@AnneWheaton I love you so much. It hurts my heart when random people who know nothing about you are cruel to you. I know you know this, but I'm saying it again, and in public: I am a whole person because you are in my life. You are my favorite human in all the universes.

@jayrosen_nyu @ddale8 That's fair. Appreciate everything you do, Jay.
A fan, at a Vegas concession stand: can I have a fork? Server: there were no forks in medieval times, so there are no forks AT Medieval Times.
@jayrosen_nyu @ddale8 That gives Trump the benefit of the doubt, which he continues to not earn.
Though I suspect that when you have to wait one whole season before you make it to the #StanleyCup finals, you want to make that pregame show memorable.

@bdgrabinski They don't know and they don't care. It's sickening.

@avatastic I stopped using it, because I didn't feel it was responsible to share my personal list, which is very large and very aggressive, and which I know has false positives.
Finally, yes, I am aware that people who need to see this may already be on the block list so it's an even bigger waste of my time. Thanks for listening. Try to make Twitter less shitty, because it's up to us to be the change we wish to see in the world. /end
I hate that I have to waste time writing this, but my patience is incredibly thin these days, and unless and until Twitter and Jack take the issue of bots and neonazis and shitty dickheads deliberately wrecking the signal to noise ratio, this is how it'll be. 7/x
If you wree blocked by accident, and it genuinely bothers you, there are easy ways to reach out to me to talk about it like adults do. If you have a big public tantrum? Now you're blocked intentionally, and so are your followers, because I don't have time for your bullshit. 6/x
Some of the time, it's some shitty pepe dickweed who is trying to troll and encourage their idiot followers to harass me. When that happens, I autoblock all their followers. See the above note about my time and attention. 5/x
Most of the time, when someone has a tantrum and their followers dogpile on me, it's a YouTuber who lives in a world where they're the center of their universe and they think this is a great way to get attention and views. That's ... kind of dumb. 4/x
First of all, nobody is entitled to my time or attention on this service. Try to be an adult about that. Second, Twitter is shitty enough without people having big public tantrums at me about something that I wasn't even aware of. 3/x
Because these tools are imperfect, they occasionally ensnare people who shouldn't be blocked or muted. Some folks email and ask me about it. I usually apologize and unblock them. Other people have big public tantrums about it and their followers dogpile on me. 2/x
I've said this a lot of times, and I'll say it again: Because Twitter refuses to take abuse and harassment seriously, I have to use a lot of imperfect, blunt instruments to make Twitter usable for me. 1/x

@AnneWheaton That's weird. Anyway, they were just online looking at little bow ties for puppies. They found some really great ones.
@AnneWheaton Seamus says he's looking forward to snuggling with us on the couch, while Marlowe and Rudy play in the yard.
@AnneWheaton Marlowe says she's going to show Rudy the optimal path around the patio and yard for maximum zoomies.
@AnneWheaton I went ahead and got Rudy a BarkBox subscription, as a welcome home gift.
@AnneWheaton We decided that his name is Rudy.
@AnneWheaton I talked it over with Seamus and Marlowe and we all agree that he needs to come live with us.
You can effortlessly change the lyrics of Stiff Little Fingers' "Alternative Ulster" to "Harry the Monster" and now I need to get some Muppets to help me make a music video.

@hewittthefool Do you know that "I was following directions" was what the Nazi war criminals said at the Hague? It was not a defence then, and it is not a defence now.
@RichardHinson There are plenty of qualified professionals who did not oversee a black site and who did not personally torture anyone.
@MATHCOUNTS It was an honor and a privilege to be part of your amazing event. I am so inspired by all the #mathletes and so proud of them!

The only place Gina Haspel belongs is in prison for crimes against humanity and gross human rights violations. It's appalling that anyone, but especially Democrats who supposedly stand for human rights, may confirm her to run the CIA. https://t.co/oFnFgfUfBz
@HeatherAntos Thank you for being kind to me. We are not alone in our battle with mental illness, and I think it's really important that we stick together to push back against the stigma that keeps so many of our fellow travelers in pain. I'm grateful to know I helped a little bit.

Somewhere, deep down in their psyches, even if they won't admit it, the WHCA is embarrassed that @michelleisawolf spoke truth to power, and did their job better than they do, because they're preoccupied with access to power. It is known. https://t.co/7EUQyHxsca
@joshtpm Josh, he's having a real hard time being mocked by the Elites, a group which he is TOTALLY NOT PART OF. Give the guy a break.
@OfficialJonZal @EricBoehlert @StephenAtHome @michelleisawolf Oh he most certainly did.
It's all part of the Kabuki dance they do to protect their access. Meanwhile, the DOJ removed "need for a free press" from their official guidelines, and I hope members of the press will spill half as much ink over that, because it actually matters. 2/2
My takeaway from the #WHCD is that many members of the Correspondent's Association are clutching their pearls and dragging out their fainting couches in an effort to suck up to the people they are supposed to cover, because @michelleisawolf spoke truth to power last night. 1/2

There are about 3 million of you following my dumb tweets. This still astonishes me. But here's the thing: over the last 18ish hours, thousands and thousands of you have reached out to share a kind thought with me. You di5n't have to do that, but you did (1/x)

@TimeyWimeyRiver The only reason to be concerned is the language (which all kids have heard by the time they're 11). If we made it today, it'd be PG-13, so consider that, maybe? I showed it to my boys when they were 10 and 8.
@jonfavs The hottest of takes.
@budgie This simulation just uses so much redundant code...
Just remember that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell own this disaster of a presidency as much as Trump does. They have enabled and coddled him every single step of the way. None of this would be a dire as it is, if they honored their oaths of office.
Imagine the right wing reaction if *any* Democratic president had a lawyer who was raided by the FBI. Now imagine that this president called the raid *of their personal attorney* "an attack on our country". Just keep that in mind for the next 24 hours or so.

@grep_harder Straight up Deb. Running 9.4 Stable.
@BPGPhoenix I'm finally going to take a look at The Stanley Parable, SOMA, and This War of Mine. (And try not to spend too much time in Civ VI or Papers, Please.)
[SOLVED] I couldn't get Steam to install on Debian, because it needed 32-bit libraries. It was *unbelievably* hard to find a solution, so I'm sharing it here, to hopefully help others: sudo apt-get install libgl1-nvidia-glx:i386 takes care of the libs you're missing.
@robspodcastmug @DavidCornDC @Isikoff This is so much better, and so much *more* than Fire and Fury. It's not sensationalized at all, and it's just truly outstanding journalism.
I'm about 100 pages into @DavidCornDC and @Isikoff 's #RussianRouletteBOOK. I expected the *how*, but I didn't expect the *why*. The history lesson we get about Trump's ambitions in Moscow and what lead to Russia's election interference is upsetting, compelling, and profound.

2109 words (48546 total) on All We Ever Wanted Was Everything. Wrote a scene today that should have happened ~10K words ago, so I can write the scene that needs to happen around the 49K word mark. #wordmetrics
YET ANOTHER UPDATE: 48ish hours later, my back has decided that if I attempt to do strenuous things, like standing up or bending to pet my dog, it will go into spasms that drop me to the ground. Being middle-aged is THE FUCKING BEST.

And to provide the closure that none of you knew you needed: I soaked in the tub for an hour last night, took some anti-inflammatory meds, and woke up today with only some light bruising and tenderness in my back. I'm okay, and it could have been so much worse.

@dndgirl @JeanneB1962 @lanika hahahahaha
@janelleb @paperhaus Well at least we know that there's another Peter Murphy fan out there in the world, right?
@JeanneB1962 @lanika When someone calls me "Mr. Crusher", they are attempting to infantilize me. Almost without exception, it comes from a person who is trying to tell me to shut up and sing. It's incredibly stupid, and so are they.
Maine deserves so much better than Susan Collins, who sold out the entire state when she had the opportunity to protect its most vulnerable citizens from the sabotage of the ACA. Talk is cheap, Senator. Actions actually matter. https://t.co/dHwPWFvgK4

Attacking the author of a book, because you got yourself worked up over the unreleased film adaptation, is childish, embarrassing, and just plain stupid.   It is taking all of my self control to keep this a subtweet, and not a call for a public apology.

@joshtpm um
Last night, just before the con was closed down for the day, I was waiting for Anne in the green room ... and Billie Piper walked in. SHE REMEMBERED ME FROM WHEN WE MET BEFORE AND WE TALKED LIKE PEOPLE WHO KNOW EACH OTHER and I totally held it together, like an adult would.
Billie Piper and David Tennant just walked into the Green room at #ECCC and I'm just over here trying and failing to not freak out.

@ParkerGames My people will be in touch.
@PlanetStomper We thought that maybe we were, but we checked with all the people around us and they confirmed that we were not being loud.
@ParkerGames please send rates and sizes
@felicitykate Boomer white woman. I know. I'm as shocked -- shocked -- as you are.
@BlondeChick80 Fuckin' Land Snorks, AMIRITE.
@poppingpenguin No joke: Mike and I seriously considered that maybe she was from Santa Barbara and was, like, REALLY into that fact.
@par995 I'm 99% confident that she was. She carried herself with the appropriate levels of entitlement, resentment, and rage.
Well, I feel somewhat better now, like I let go of some of the confusion, anger, insult, helplessness to respond, and sadness this woman made me feel. I hope that, if you've read this far, you'll be inspired to be kind, and take care of each other. Thanks for listening. (12/12)
I feel like Twitter's gonna make me the villain in this story, so: part of me wishes I had a picture of this woman to show 3 million people, in the hopes that she feels some shame and accountability for her actions. I know that's petty, but I'm going to own it. (11/x)
Because we do a thing on the #JoCoCruise that I dream about in the real world that is currently a dumpster fire and a giant bummer: We take care of each other, on purpose. Like, we make an effort to care for each other. That's what I love about the cruise every year. (10/x)
I want to just let it go and get on with my life, but it's unresolved in me, because I don't understand *why* this woman was such an asshole. I don't know what we did. I asked everyone around us and got shrugs in response. I also want every day to be like a #JoCoCruise day (9/x)
She got off the train in Irvine, which as someone who grew up in Southern California didn't surprise me at all (#NotAllIrviners). But here's the thing: If I needed a stark and powerful reminder about how special and wonderful the #JoCoCruise is, she gave it to me. (8/x)
I did a combination of most of those, butshe was a total coward who walked away and ignored me. I mean, if you're gonna get up in someone's face -- particularly someone who is in crippling pain -- at least have the courage to stand up and face them, right? (7/x)
I've played all the possible scenarios: I tell her she's an asshole. I call her the C word. I stand up (which I couldn't do at the time because my back was in spasms and I was in excruciating pain) and say "...the fuck did you just say?". I laugh in her face. (6/x)
Anne was furious, and told the conductor. The conductor didn't do anything but tell this woman to leave us alone. I was disappointed that she didn't experience any meaningful consequences for her actions, but, you know: White privilege is a hell of a drug. (5/x)
I really want to forgive her, and I genuinely feel sad for someone who is so angry and hateful that they would treat another person -- who isn't even doing anything -- the way she treated me and one of my friends. (4/x)
I'm still shaken up by it. I'm used to people being hateful bawbags to me on Twitter, but I haven't experienced this sort of thing in person since I was in high school. This woman was a Boomer, at least in her 60s. (3/x)
I honestly don't know why this woman was so angry and hateful. I didn't say a single thing about rich white women who treat everyone else in business class on the train don't belong there, because they are beneath her. I was literally reviewing train snacks for Instagram. (2/x)
Just two hours after I got off of #JoCoCruise yesterday, a hateful woman got right up in my face and spat out hateful bile at me. I think it's because I was making a video about train snacks. It shocked me, then made me angry, and now I'm just sad and confused. (1/x)
OMG @JonathanCoulton just announced that THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS are performing on next year's #JoCoCruise!

@ShutUpAmanda @bessbell oh yes
@GTP2017 @danpfeiffer @Mikel_Jollett Well, you are certainly an authority on a special kind of stupid.
@SzZeif @sonia__harris I have been thinking about you and your brother all day, and I am so angry and sad that you all had to go through this. I don't know you, and we'll probably never meet, but I am so relieved that you both made it safely out of there.
Maybe if there were just more guns. Maybe if schools were made out of guns.  Maybe if students and teachers were guns. Maybe if people were guns.  Maybe if guns shot out smaller guns. Maybe if everything that wasn't a gun was replaced with a gun.
@danpfeiffer @Mikel_Jollett It is further worth noting that the Russians exploited fertile ground in R voters by exploiting fears and lies perpetrated by Fox News and talk radio. It is also worth noting that Russia used and amplified GOP voter suppression tactics.

Remember this, whenever you hear Pam Bondi or Rick Scott talk about how gosh darn upset they are that there just isn't anything that could have been done differently to prevent yesterday's mass murder. #ThrowThemOut https://t.co/9Ufe3T51gC
@thatdlh @billpeek89 @ruebenslaw @jessphoenix2018 It isn't. Someone in the higher echelons of the Stupidsphere decided that this was the lie they'd be using as their talking point today, and the Stupidsphere has run with it.

@redidbull Oh I know the answer to this! It's because the NRA has bought and completely controls the Attorney General in Florida, the Governor of Florida, and both of Florida's senators.
@jb33z When you're done trying to deflect, ask the armed police who were already at the school and see what they say.
@jennschiffer @NoraReed Or the center of the Sun.
Marco Rubio should go meet with every single parent who lost a child in yesterday's terrorist mass murder, and tell them to their faces that there's nothing that could have been done to prevent their child's murder. Then he should show them his receipts from the NRA and hug them. https://t.co/f1M3TjEWbL

We have to remember that none of this would be possible without enthusiastic and craven enabling from Vichy GOP leaders like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. They own this disaster as much as Trump and his cabinet do, and they must be held accountable.
Trump's total capture of the Republican party and its base fits a pattern. Just like he has done for decades, Trump took a garbage thing and put his name on it, sold it to rubes, and is collecting as much money as he can from it, before he declares bankruptcy and discards it.

It's that time of year when Bell brings awareness for and raises money to support mental health issues. There are 3.22 million of you seeing this, and if you all RT #BellLetsTalk , we can raise over 150K, and encourage people to talk about mental health issues! Let's do this!

This is a weird, longshot question, but I can't find the answer on my own: does anyone know what the Pantone values are for the three basic uniform colors on TNG?
@wilw_ebooks Good advice, bot. Thanks for the reminder.
@MaryRobinette @IreneGallo Amazing cover.

@JoshuaIan610 The closest thing to a central entity in this case are the main AAA publishers, and the majority of gaming publications that cater almost exclusively to men. You and I are dudes, so it's easy for us to not notice these things.
Gaming should be for everyone who wants to play, without regard to gender. It's so disappointing that the industry largely views women as somehow less than men, simply because they are women. And too many male gamers treat female gamers poorly as a result. Be better.
I am so disappointed in the leaders in the gaming world who have allowed this to happen. https://t.co/FI5RLvORic
@bryanbroyles Yeah, and that's totally fair. But to suggest that, if you had to choose between her and Trump?! That's just nuts.

@WildBillWellman Oh wait. I misread the link. I'm referring to this from today's Politico: https://t.co/QOyLwdKwwK My point was about this guy.
@WildBillWellman Yeah I'm not going to put a lot of faith in a guy who is anti-choice, pro-gun, and doesn't push back when a constituent is racist about Muslims. That guy knows that he's gonna be replaced in a progressive wave, so he's floating trial balloons before he switches parties.
@TBow82C He's a very stupid person because he asked a very stupid question, intended to prop up a very stupid premise.

@Boogie2988 @_Pytheas Not that it matters, but a lot of them are racist and homophobic, if the scores of tweets I got from them are any indication of their behavior. I don't know if you are cool with that, but it's something to think about.
@dexbonus @PeanutButterGmr @JKCompletesIt @Boogie2988 Sorry, Dodger! It was a mistake.
@_Pytheas @Boogie2988 It was a mistake, but based on about 90% of the mentions I'm getting from his followers, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea. I've unblocked him, because it was an honest mistake, but WOW the racism, bigotry, and homophobia coming at me from his followers is reprehensible.
