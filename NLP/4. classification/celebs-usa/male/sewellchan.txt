@brittanyhite C‚Äômon, compared to NY and IN this winter is nothing
@jaclyncosgrove @skarlamangla Confession: This is my first winter in L.A., and I've been really happy. I like cool, crisp air and temperatures in the 40s/50s, with low humidity. Is it so bad? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Another exciting day at @latimes! Welcome to these new hires:   @AliceShort3, deputy Column One editor @brittanyhite, newsroom project manager @JRcorp, video journalist  @DCteachild and @Adriana_Lacy, audience engagement editors @MarkPuente, LAPD reporter

@GustavoArellano @latimes @hbecerraLATimes @shelbygrad @StevePadilla2 I first learned about this from ‚ÄúPrivileged Son,‚Äù Dennis McDougal‚Äôs 2001 biography of Otis Chandler. I wonder if it connected with its intended audience.

@PekingMike His Cultural Revolution class was one of my favorite experiences in college. He was a brilliant scholar and a decent man. RIP.
@mariabustillos So glad to hear this. As a newcomer, I am inspired by @latimes veterans like @marialaganga @suhorton @RJLosAngeles @AliceShort3 @margotroosevelt @AmyTheHub @hookjan @DoyleMcManus, who have returned to help the place get back on its feet.
The @latimes newsroom, though still significantly smaller than three years ago, has grown by more than 25% since @DrPatSoonShiong acquired the company last June. We‚Äôre all proud to be part of the revival of this vital institution.
But wait, there‚Äôs more!   @MarkPuente joins us to cover the LAPD  @AliceShort3 rejoins us as deputy editor for Column One   Richard Read joins us as Seattle correspondent, Paul Feldman as an assistant foreign/national editor and Michael Ordo√±a as an entertainment reporter

@JonRMcClure Thanks! Sadly, I don‚Äôt know any of these languages.  But I learn every day from @bgerst @palewire @standyro @clintfisher @jperezlatimes. We need more, many more, technologists to join them.

Overheard in the @latimes newsroom: Will the Los Angeles teachers' strike be called off on account of the rain?
Especially strong is her reporting on the rise of Buzzfeed; on Vice's treatment of women; and on legacy-media errors (the WP missed a chance to invest in Facebook; NYT passed up a chance to invest in Google). If you care about journalism's future, read this book. /EOM
Only a fraction of the book is about Jill's tenure @nytimes. She's introspective about her record as a manager, and about the role gender might have played in her firing. (For the record: I worked at Op-Ed, not the newsroom, the whole time Jill was executive editor.)
Jill argues that editors have had to become more commercially minded (sometimes in  troubling ways) as the Internet‚Äîand then social media‚Äîwrecked old business models. But the book is narration, not polemic. It's a worthy successor to David Halberstam's "Powers That Be" (1979).
The book has been unfairly maligned. Only a few pages even mention Trump. The assessment of @nytimes ‚Äî where @JillAbramson worked from 1997 until 2014 ‚Äî is judicious and introspective. This is not a book of petty score-settling or name-dropping. Quite the opposite.
I just finished "Merchants of Truth" by @JillAbramson. It's a masterful work of reportage and analysis, chronicling the era of news media disruption through the prism of four companies: @nytimes @washingtonpost @BuzzFeed and @VICE.  https://t.co/Ma5NYdhSAr

@mattdpearce LOL! ‚Äú ‚ÄòYou had to be interesting.‚Äô What pressure.‚Äù
@CShalby @latguild @latimes Happy work anniversary! I‚Äôm very grateful to be your colleague.
@joshtpm @GreatDismal I am struck that Clinton, W. and Trump were all born between June and August 1946. It‚Äôs kind of astonishing, the impact this cohort of 72-year-olds has had on our nation.
And @baratunde gives a shout-out to @RevDrBarber @ThisIsZeroHour and the Green New Deal. It‚Äôs a wrap!
Blight on the future: ‚ÄúWatch our political parties, and our institutions. If they disintegrate, we disintegrate.‚Äù
Blight: ‚ÄúWe have been here before.‚Äù Trump sui generis in some ways, but  crisis in institutions predated him. Revolutions inspire counterrevolution. Douglass was the rarest of reformers: He saw his cause win, then lived 30+ more years to see the Jim Crow backlash.
In the 1850s, Douglass moved from abolitionist moral suasion toward  political resistance. He learned a political pragmatism that gave him hope for a collision that might allow America to remake itself.
Blight on Douglass: ‚ÄúWhen he came back from England, he was a very angry young black man: ‚ÄòI have no country, I have no patriotism.‚Äô Even Wendell Phillips told him to tone it down. ‚Ä¶ However, Douglass never stopped believing in the principles.‚Äù
Blight on Douglass: ‚ÄúHe lived and hated America‚Ä¶ He loved the creed. He loved the natural-rights tradition‚Ä¶rights that we are born with, like precious ore from the earth‚Ä¶ But hypocrisy became his subject: the way America has built itself on creeds and then violated them.‚Äù
Blight calls Douglass‚Äôs speech ‚ÄúWhat to the Slave Is the 4th of July?‚Äù a rhetorical masterpiece, a symphony in three movements.  https://t.co/t0jIfgPEt2
Blight: Douglass was the ultimate ironist. In his youth, he responded to racism with rage; in old age, with humor. How else to react to the absurdity of racism?
This is L.A: A packed house on a rainy Thursday night, listening to @baratunde interview the historian Davis W. Blight, author of a new book on Frederick Douglass. Bravo to @ThePublicSquare @ASU for convening us! https://t.co/utyrpp1Cef

Hersh: "Anytime my government says to me we have high confidence that Russia hacked, that Saddam has WMD, I worry."
Hersh on Trump: "You think you're going to run him out," but in fact, the press may be helping him stay in power. "We're in 76 wars right now, about which you don't know much‚Ä¶ many of them in Africa."
Hersh wants stories on Yemen, consumer product safety, deregulation. "The way to him is to focus on them." The Democrats "are running against him‚Äîeverything is about him." He says they're risking a repeat of Hillary's mistakes.
Hersh thinks media is over-covering Trump: "The constant beating of Trump‚Äîi just watched the polls, he's going up and up. We're underestimating him in a way. The Democrats in particular‚Äîthere's nothing he can do right."
Sy Hersh on the new CIA director, Gina Haspel: "Everything I hear is that she's straight."
Hersh: "You've got to read before you write." Reads voraciously in preparation for any interview.
Hersh on finding sources: "You've got to find those people‚Äîand they're all over the place‚Äîwho've taken the oath of office to the Constitution and mean it."  #IRE18
Seymour Hersh, talking with @mattapuzzo at #IRE18, recounts John Mitchell's post-conviction advice, scribbled on the back of a credit-card receipt: "Next time, take the Fifth."
Baquet: "Biggest crisis in journalism is demise of local newspapers." Baron: "Financial challenges for local and regional news organizations are far greater" than for WP/NYT. Both think hard-hitting investigative reporting is KEY to business model, central to what readers want.
Baquet doesn't think NYT has too much Trump coverage, but "we have to be really careful to make sure we're covering the rest of the world‚Äîand we do." News orgs are still struggling to show breadth of coverage on mobile screens.
Baquet: "We're not in an era when anyone can know what journalism will look like, other than broad principles, 10 years from now." Baron also emphasizes modesty, sense of accountability. And Baquet emphasizes empathy, true open inquiry, independent thought.
What Dean Baquet looks for in a reporter: "deep curiosity, independent-mindedness, thick skin, flexibility, the ability to learn‚ÄîI'm always thrown off by reporters who sound like they know everything, because nobody knows everything."
Baquet: "I do not want for powerful people to love journalism. I want them to love the principle of journalism‚Ä¶ It does not bother me if powerful people do not love our institution."
Baquet: "We do not want to be the opposition party‚Ä¶That's an extraordinarily important principle‚Ä¶ that will outlast this president and other presidents." Baron "totally" agreed. "Our job is to hold powerful institutions and individuals to account," no matter which party.
Baron: "Fake news"/"enemy of the people" attacks have eroded public's trust in the press. Says WaPost has gotten used to it‚Äîit's part of the background noise. Baquet, still, calls it a "remarkable effort" to discredit institutions.
McFadden: "Do prizes matter?" Baron: Matters in terms of public image, acknowledgment of staff's hard work. But what matters most is the underlying work. "Frankly there's a lot of great work that hasn't won a prize and that has over time proved to be incredibly important."
On anonymous sources. Baquet: "We historically have not been very transparent, and that has not helped us. In the era when we depended on advertising rather than readers, we were less transparent, we weren't thinking about the reader as much."
Baquet: The term "lie" should be used "very sparingly" (it causes people to focus on the word "lie," not the story); NYT has used the word to describe Trump's birther lie. It's merited if the lie is "constant and flagrant."
Baquet: relentless attacks on the press, casting is as "enemy of the people," the "obfuscations and lies"‚Äîthat's very different. "All presidents, to some degree or another, lie.‚Ä¶ This is different. These are accounts of daily events that are odds with the truth."
Baron, comparing administrations: This one is far more aggressive, always on the attack, constantly trying to disqualify the press as an arbiter of truth.
Baquet: "editor-driven" shouldn't mean pushing down ideas from the top, but being actively engaged, making sure great ideas bubble up. Says all his time is spent in the newsroom or at home anyway, so any of his ideas would be "derivative." (Too modest imho.)
Baquet on Weinstein stories: "I think that story took hold because it involved movie stars." Stories on Trump and women hadn't connected as strongly. The fact that Weinstein's victims were movie stars was "transformational."
Baquet: "Yes we're competitive, we're deadly competitive, we want to beat the other‚Äîbut we're in a moment when there are so many attacks on the press, and on our institutions in particular, that there are things we need to stand together on."
Baquet: Downside of a big I-team: loss of ability to move fast on a tip. Altogether, NYT probably has 30-35 investigative reporters; it's trying to rebuild a Metro investigative unit and to create an international one
NYT newsroom staff ~1,400; WPost, 825. How many are investigative reporters? Baron: "I hope all of them," says ~35 focus on investigations. Baquet defends value of having centralized group of investigative reporters "not beholden to the daily story."
Baquet speaks warmly of WPost but says there are things only NYT can do, if only because of its size and breadth; Baron: "I like being the underdog," says he's "glad Jeff Bezos doesn't treat us as a charity"
