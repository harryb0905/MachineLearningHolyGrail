missing @thedailyshow is just killing me. here's hoping there's a resolution soon...
@haigtweets @WSOP i'm not sure what the reasoning was.  my guess is some rights issue with espn, etc...
Obv goes without saying but if both of the ladies at the @wsop final table bubble...what a heartbreaker.

well, @atlanta_hawks are gone embarrassingly so it's on to rooting for the nuggets and the clippers...
so appropriate that @atlanta_hawks season may end with josh smith taking a comically terrible shot.  sickening.

@TheTmay he's the real deal. went to same high school. bunch of us old school PA bballers have been chatting about it. great, great stuff.
you can usually gauge if someone has musical taste by whether or not they think adele is amazing. #yes
@irishdolly22 i didn't catch the yelled portion.  what did he say that was announced over?
@JoeBlutenKat think it depends on what era of radiohead you are talking about, but i see your point.
lead singer of foster the people always looks absolutely terrified to me.  ha.
that's what i'm saying, the fact that the foo fighters are even in a category with coldplay and radiohead is asinine.
personally miss the red hair, but is rihanna even serious being as hot as she is?  this tune is probably best song on coldplay's new album.
who woulda thought that when the foos first started they would turn into what they have? current album best since 'colour'...
grammy's worth watching for performances but always a bummer that they stopped being musically relevant or accurate since when i was a kid.
@GameShow2Go wow, man! Awesomest face cake ever! Happy bday.

@SaraUnderwood i do the exact same thing and try to figure out what's wrong with me every time. Maybe we like drama.
two biggest musical losses that make me the most sad: Shannon Hoon and Jeff Buckley. hard to imagine what we missed out on...
@StroudRounder @atlanta_hawks met dominique when i was a kid at a warriors game.  forever cursed.  ha.
@runwicked all of my teams are perennial underachievers.  always.
@RossEldridge met dominique at a warriors game when i was a kid.  forever cursed.  ;)
if my @atlanta_hawks had just an ounce each of smarts and heart they could be a top three team in the league. drives me nuts to watch.
loved the cubs teams that got us believing (2000's) + i'll never forget those players, but nice to see theo is serious. http://t.co/Q8qqvaBv

@WriterJen explain or solve things.  in that way it reminded me of actual life, which i think i liked. frustrating tho.  ;)
@WriterJen yep, def.  ToL more evokes a feeling and suggests things, but never ties it up.  touches on frustrations and pain, but doesn't...
@WriterJen really amazing movie, but def not for everyone.  it's more like a piece of art than a film, i think...
@YeeGone yeah, that was a serious ass trouncing. you guys are real seriously good, cuz we are too, and you beat us down. drinks on me! lots!
@YeeGone was there a game tonight? I don't think anyone played...

@JeffMadsenobv dude, you slid, huh?? i did the same thing this summer on a play.  that field tears up knees...
@KeK442 i guess there is some issue about moving up in money, but other than that i would never fold, and still then never personally...
@SrslySirius feeling is mutual.  good times and great conversations. i'm sure i'll see you out there again soon...

@Poff yes! Time for a vacation for you...
@JessicAdKincaid @MandaLeatherman I'm sorrrrrry!
@lonmceachern need to grab a bite while we're both here. Apologies for the quick hello yesterday...
Made my way through the first day of the @HPTPokerTour day 1. Now for some mountain hiking before day 2 on sunday. Let's do it!
Playing @hptpokertour main event here in Black Hawk, CO. Chatting it up with good peoples. Always good peeps in Colorado...
@HPTGreg the usual then for the family? Pop tarts and chicken mcnuggets?
Unbelievable. @Kevmath was just given the nickname "renegade". So jealous and so satiated simultaneously.
@JessicAdKincaid in one word: yes. Enjoy!
@HPTJen it hurts when people lie about you. I warned. Pandora's box. Opened.
In Black Hawk, Colorado for some @hptpokertour poker. Already loving this little mountain city. Need a drink tho!
@HPTFred @Kevmath landed in denver. @hptpokertour, big fred, AND kevmath?! It's an embarrasment of riches here!
this espn special on the #cubs and steve bartman is making me sick. my stomach is twisted and my eyes watering. i'll never forget that year.

@niftyatfifty50 not sure. prolly paint a bunch + make them community bikes next year. still, people shouldn't be leaving them. not right. :(
Man, really disappointing. :( "@danger_ranger: Post-burn abundance: 2,000 bicycles left on the playa. http://t.co/tpqILga"

@Kellcast I was just thinking the same thing the other day. We never go there. We should more.
november nine is pretty stacked with great players this year.  more so than past years...?  congrats to all you sickos...  ;)
@mcleankarr @PhelpsTheFish @Tattytats that will be sick. i remember her mentioning that to me actually. have fun, root on a gold! gogogo.
@mcleankarr yessir. so great there. incredible place. how long you guys in town for? gonna make it down to the beach at all?
@BJNemeth @SavagePoker if you have the time hit jackson hole for a bit, and the tetons. my favorite mtn range in the country. awesome.
@BJNemeth @SavagePoker yellowstone is absolutely amazing. best thing to do is just wander around, get lost, go on long hikes. bj's def right
57 left going into today's @WSOP main event. reminds me of my finish in 56th, few years ago. incredible experience. luck to all still in...
@bemadthen @DreFrench @LArunr @spectorjosh i blew it!  no excuse!  hope you had a great time in paradise tho.  :)
@ErinBoll @deanrandy @mattpalmer11 always a spot in the sand for each of you...
@ErinBoll @DeanRandy @mattpalmer11 do dearly miss vegas + all of you cats...but gotta say, it's pretty f*cking nice at the beach today.  :)
@DeanRandy how you doing back in vegas??  you guys need to make an LA pilgrimmage!
@CourtHarrington sorry to hear, bud.  back to great life on the lake tho as a consolation...
well hello, hermosa beach. nice to see you again. i'm back. :)
@GamingCounsel no worries. Def accept rain check.
@jesswelman exactly. People make more and worse mistakes.
@GamingCounsel sorry I missed you in vegas. Hope you had agreat trip. :)
@jesswelman good players should want it announced continually as it has a negative effect on weaker players. I don't get the complaining.
Out of WSOP main event with AK vs. 99. Got lucky in two pots before to have a chance at getting back to 25k though. GL to everyone still in.
AQ no good vs. AK in a battle of the blinds. Down to 4k. Looking bleak. Try to get lucky though.
WSOP main event, day two. Starting out with 40k. Go time.
@jessiestacks tyty!  :)
@Tattytats finished with about 40k.  crush 'em today!
@laurenkling time to get it going!  you got this... :)
@Tattytats gl tomorrow! Go get 'em.
Bah. Finished up w/40k. Beat everyone at the table but lost about 50k to the same guy. Stoked to still be kicking tho. See you at day 2...
@TommyVedes always have faith in the lucky green chips...
Pretty sick. Only hands I've lost of any consequence are trip 7's, trip Q's, QQ, and QQ, but for about 55k! Sitting on only 26k now.
@MattKeikoan I'm much underneath that list, but you can add me on there too. Played my first live hands at LC.
@DeanRandy incredible match today. Caught it before I came in. WOW.
@Bearw8 man, I know. You ran pure awful, in every hand. Rough day.
Lost 40k pot right before dinner...but then won a 40k pot 5 hands later. Steady at 65k still.
@YeeGone my aces always hold up. ;)
WSOP main event, my day one. 65k through first two levels from 30k starting stack.
@JCahlik great meeting you, bud. Thnx for the love!
@AlCantHang @taopauly man, one of my absolute favorite all time bands...
@jkesseldesign hope yours was great back east!  :)
Officially my hero: @Poff
Anyone at the Tropicana?!
@YeeGone I keep mine to myself  you're welcome. :)
@YeeGone what are you playing? Did you have to hear aces stories after thaaaaaat one?
food poisoning: the gift that keeps on giving.
i think i am officially the king of late night day one WSOP busts in '11. getting pretty incredible at outlasting 70%-80% of the field tho.
@YeeGone bob + weave. Must find those who will not tell them. They are few and far between, but they exist. ;)
Congrats to @aakkari on his first bracelet. Couldn't happen to a better guy! Brasilsilsilsilsil.
@Jason haha. Famous last words...
Anyone happen to know if @randallin bluffs big or value bets big??
Was listening to "Totally 80's" to honor @laurenkling's outfit today, but @kristygazes has inspired me to switch over to Guns 'N Roses.
@JonV we epect 100%! You are Vuonger!
@tristancre8ive send in the specialists!  haha...
@change100 happy birthday! in a sense, they did get paper that year. you're a writer...
@GriffinArnoldAA you know, i have heard that a few times.  also i get edward norton a lot. i don't see it, but i often hear it. ha.
@thegroupie barefoot like a dumb slut?! That actually made me el oh el.
Pretty great to watch @_Fabsoul_ receive his #WSOP bracelet. Nice to see that kind of positivity + support in the poker community.
@SDbrwnidgirl trust me, you are already much cooler than me. :)
@ERICSCOTPHOTO but of course!  and thank you!  :)
@sandypantalones played in about 10 so far. only 1 small cash. saving up my good run for the main event tho... ;)
Friday night rager... http://yfrog.com/kjjpfclj
new york.  proud of you.  great job.
huge congratulations to an old friend, @_Fabsoul_ , on taking down the bracelet today. one of the originals from when i came onto the scene.
rooting for one of the good guys, eddy sabat, to take down the 2500 bracelet tonight. get it going, young man...
107 degrees, vegas?  seems a little excessive...
@oskargarcia go bears, today...
@JasonMercier excellent, as always, my friend. great win.
@KimberlyLansing know what you mean. feel like people in sf are more "real" sort of nyc style. la seem happier + want to be. make any sense?
By any reasonable account, I should really be drinking heavily by now.
The last several years, albeit on a much smaller schedule, have really made me appreciate how well I ran at the beginning of my career.
@jdnewitt @chipjett if out of the tournament. What time you guys playing?
@WriterJen @BJNemeth thank you!
Album of the day, Braddigan/"Watchfires"

@merchdawg @Tattytats haha, that was good.  kudos, friend... :)
if you're looking for a team to root for at the college world series, look no further: http://t.co/gixGhg1 Go Bears!
@jodom25 incredible story, huh?!  gotta root for the bears this year!  Go Bears!
Out third for @barrygreenstein. Thought we had this one in the bag once he built up a stack. Wasn't to be tho...
Hanging tough at the 10k limit hold'em final table. @barrygreenstein on a rush and is 2nd in chips, with 4 players left.
@DanOBrienPoker now is your time, buddy. Smash.
@rruuxx hanging tough. Above average. 7 players left, I believe.
Sweating the old man, @barrygreenstein, at the 10k limit hold'em final table. Bring home that bracelet...
Very important,: poker fans: Follow @danobrienpoker. Best kept secret in tournament poker. Deep in a WSOP event as we speak #FF
@WSOPRGUY every day, great news.  when we gonna grab a beer?
@barrygreenstein hey, senior's event started at noon.  hope you got some sleep last night...
@DanOBrienPoker yeah, buddy! That's what we like to see!
@TommyVedes happy to help.  :)  had a good time playing with you today, buddy.  mash it up tomorrow...
limped into day 2 of the $1500 no-limit. lost big pot late to come back tomorrow w/only 10k in chips. at least chips went to a nice guy...
@taopauly I still wanna tag along to a show sometime...
@taopauly don't hate.
Gonna steal time from the faulty plan...
@michelle_lau heya. Welcome home! Yep, I'm playing at noon. Come holler.
@UFOUNDBOBO not tonight, but I definitely want to go soon.
@JonV gogogogo!
what's worse than making a game 7 win guarantee?  backing off of it after.  that is just so weak.
"...if you believe in yourself, you will know how to ride a bike! if you don't, then you just keep practicing..!"
@DeanRandy cuuuuuuubs.  ship the sweep payment soon!
@michelle_lau glad to hear this.  :)
@thegroupie haha. Good point. :)
@Indigoae actually that would seem full of points and meanings. Just all bad ones. Ha.
Is there anything more pointless at a poker table than transparent sunglasses?
@MikeMcDonald89 very interested to see how the milk shake making portion + baby snatching goes...
Hard to imagine playing a tournament worse than I just played in that limit 6-max one. Yikes. Pretty embarrassing
They got me. AK v AQ. Out.
In the money in the pot limit hold'em event. First cash of the '11 WS0P out of the way now. Set sites on the bracelet...
@chazbeaner mmmmmm, mama d's.  so brutal.
hardest part about being in Vegas for the @WSOP is missing my afternoons at @Catalina_Coffee back in Hermosa...
@3Bullits any kind of payments seems like it must be a good sign.
BaileyBok Dog, today... http://yfrog.com/5pgo4ej
@TeamDrawingDead who strikes out in softball?  i mean, really.  thnx for the invite.  good times...
@bwpoker definitely.  :)  be sure to come up and say hi when you're here in vegas, my friend...
@veeRob glad to see you put those chips to use asshat.
@jdnewitt I shall be there.
@goldman above and beyond what any reasonable person could expect.
@caitycaity @PokerVixen @BJNemeth @melissalvla @jvfricke wow! That's great. I'll have to bring her down then...
@BJNemeth absolutely. We'll figure something out tho.
@BJNemeth we'll set it up whenever.  shame i can't bring bailey into the rio.  :(
@BJNemeth i knew you would buckle eventually.  ;)
mr @jeffmadsenobv is a littttttle bit better than me at racquetball, & it blows. can't quite make up those 5 inches of height he has on me.
@DeanRandy daaaaamn, you're right.  all jeep praise due to the master himself...  :)
Took the top + doors off my jeep this morning. Feels like I am riding a roller coaster in a wind tunnel on Vegas freeways.
@BluffMagEric i'll get you next time, fa sho...
@JASON_BARNHART ran super well through dinner as one of the CL, but wheels came off after eats. back at it soon tho...
@BluffMagEric heath bar.  yupyup.
Dairy Queen Blizzard. That's right. I'm raging this Friday. WHA?!
Gross. Complete collapse post dinner. Out. Opponents turn set of 8's and river set of 4's against my overpairs to get the rest.
Was flying high in $1500 limit event, with 29k at dinner, but fallen on tough times post eats. Only 9k now.
@Tattytats @mcleankarr @Kevmath 1500. Big Mclean at my table, making everyone smile. 10k doesn't start till 5.
@AmirTalai ty, sir!  appreciate the love!  :)
@Tattytats i feel the crotian (london?  spanish?) love!  :)  when you in town?
@AlCantHang @tattytats @SavagePoker excellent, excellent stuff.  :)
Hello WSOP. My first event tomorrow...
Hermosa --&gt; Las Vegas
@sandypantalones saddest story ever: joined 1st week of existence, but accidentally let it lapse 4 years later. Had to resign up then. Doh!
@brunocr thnx, bruno!  miss you, sir.  hope all is well with you...
@lance_bradley @Roothlus 1 just not self-serving + indulgent enough tho.
big first day at the 2011 wsop. i really hope it's encore won't be me getting murdered once i get there tomorrow. :)  #halfjokes
@VipNino unfortunately no one cares if i boycott the wsop for ub players. it would just be me trying to win some fans/support.
@allin41505 unfortunately no. may do some one-off shows however. just no funds to do it regularly anymore...
@DreFrench sounds great! we'll keep the city warm for you!
@BstandsforBite no. poker will be back bigger and better than ever.  may just take some years tho...
People's complete inability to read between the lines never ceases to amaze me.
@basebaldy @MaryMphoto congrats.  :)  great way to start the summer...
@DawgRounder more than happy to.  glad you have a blast!
@DreFrench you can count on that.  ;)  when we going to see you back down in these parts?
@MarlonShirley well done, friend. great way to start the summer...
see ya'll on the beach today...
@TheBaubShow @fightchick17 honestly, it's very good, but it's not like any film in a conventional way that we know it.

@michelle_lau ok, let me know when you are.  and i'll try, but sadly, you  know it's what i do best.  ;)
@michelle_lau so happy to hear/see you're doing better. See you next week?
love walking the dog at 1 or 2 in the morning.  everything is so quiet.  just the wind and the waves.  oh, and the peeing, of course...
hangover 2: exactly as advertised.  hilarious, and a run over of the first film, but you don't really mind...
@DeanRandy agreed BRAH! See you in vegas soon?
wow.  just wow.  dallas.  miami.  it's like they just waited till the last five minutes knowing that thunder/bulls would wilt under pressure

@melissalvla thank you. (bashful smile)
@JeffMadsenobv the hawks did better than the lakers this playoffs.  that should shame you, my friend.  :)  it's all love...
stay classy, big guy.  RT @SignatureSounds @xxxBiBiJones I'm in your area & want to fuck!
@JeffMadsenobv is now a bad time to talk about how great it is to not have the lakers in playoffs? don't mean to kick when you're down. ;)
@SignatureSounds you're a clown in your grammar.  apostrophes are your friends.  learn to use them correctly.
young teams just don't win championships in the nba.  just doesn't happen.  #poise

@richbelsky @SavagePoker sounds great.  i'm in.
@Karak2p2 i'll pass. ty tho. i can't anyway, but know i wouldn't get a fair shake even if i did. i can't win in that community. ty tho.
@owenlaukkanen congrats, my friend.  you guys deserved it tonight.  awesome game.
@Karak2p2 i'll pass.  i appreciate all of your efforts in community, but you can't treat people like shit and expect them to engage with you
amazing game. canucks played just a little better, little tougher, little faster. love my @NHLBlackhawks tho. van deserved the win. congrats
@Karak2p2 clearly i'm not going to come on a show where you guys crack up about videos about me and mock me, sir. wouldn't that be obv?
@Karak2p2 unfortunately i am unable to, for obv legal reasons. i apologize. isn't your show always mocking me as well?
@NHLBlackhawks feeling seabrook #overtimehero
i think i can feel the city of vancouver's heart beating out of it's chest.  this is gonna be fun.  gooooo @NHLBlackhawks!  OT!
@scott_seiver @owenlaukkanen incredible game. crawford is just magnificent tonight. van playing so well. just a sick game seven. wow. ot.
oooooooh noooooooo! GOAL!  @NHLBlackhawks.  wow.  speechless.  this game is just insane.  completely insane.
incredible game. Canucks playing out of their skulls. Crawford keeping us in it, on everything. wow. 5 min. let's get that goal to tie!
@owenlaukkanen agreed. that's what makes it so fun tonight tho. rogers is electric right now. i'll tell you that much...  #gohawks
pretty clear the @atlanta_hawks aren't going to be pulling this one out.  mentally turning to the real deal tonight, let's go @NHLBlackhawks
@davidtuthill unfortunately i'm not legally able to do much. you calling me a scumbag doesn't change that. i'd like to help more. i can't.
@dscottreid both.  lucky that they are on after each other.  not a bad night of sports...
hoping hawks of all sorts win tonight. especially @NHLBlackhawks tho. let's break those canuck hearts. they might not recover from this one.
some old college friends of mine started their own winery (!) up in sonoma. give them a look... http://www.vaughnduffywines.com
@chicagocards1 solid point. met dominique wilkins when i was a kid. the sports gods have a sense of humor. chicago for every other sport...
this sunday is an embarrassment of sports riches: @atlanta_hawks win, @NHLBlackhawks force a game seven AND @Lakers lose?! not too shabby...
wonder how all the Canucks fans are feeling now? game seven...and look who's right there. @NHLBlackhawks. ghosts of hockey playoffs past?
@RealMikeWilbon this one feels like a game seven. i think the canucks feel like they'll lose if it actually goes seven. tense, tense, tense.
@jkesseldesign thnx jesy.  same to you, as always. :)
@2p2Pokercast can't you just feel it? if chi gets a win here today, winning in game seven is a forgone conclusion. you can just feel it...
Whew, one Hawks win locked up. Way to hold @atlanta_hawks. Now let's get another. Go @NHLBlackhawks. Make those Canucks hear footsteps...
This @atlanta_hawks series is bizarre. Outcomes have nothing to do w/Orl. If we swing the ball + less isos, we sweep, win by 15 every game.

@KatherineKenned more than welcome. ready the dc house! haha.
@WSOPTD congrats, jack.  happy to hear, friend...
@ShaneSchleger gl with everything shane. i remember when we were friends. wish you the best...i really do.
@ShaneSchleger your prerogative. would have spoken w/ him, had he called me. prolly even apologized if he took initial message as menacing.
@ShaneSchleger diluting yourself if you think JA actually felt threatened. hate me for ub, that's fine, but understand the situation here.
@looshle totally agree.
@olegsmith glgl. do this thing now.
@JonAguiar everything actually. ty. other than that, call me if you wanna talk. don't expect an apology tho. you won't get one.
@JonAguiar just curious why you didn't post our entire convo? might make things not so insidious + create context? maybe give that a try.
@steveodwyer can't say i'm surprised. Obv why he wants a public war. He can win that. I'd be embarrassed now if i were Jon. Be a man, dude.
@steveodwyer well, we all make incorrect assumptions. Had he called me, 3 days ago, when i sent him my # we coulda talked about it.
@JonAguiar i feel sorry for you. I really do. Didn't threaten you. Grow up. Come talk to me like a man, but we both know that won't happen.
Having lunch in the Bay Area with @leahcowan. It's cultastic! http://yfrog.com/h0b7ogoj

"...and if the magic of the adventure overcomes, we won't cry because it could be fun..."
@Mark_Gahagan is what it is. i'm sure you made the forum crowd happy.

@scottbhuff hey, do you remember what the board was in our game of 'one card no limit show' when we both had kings??
this day is really starting to piss me off.
bad beat jackpot is beyond ridiculous on @UB.  is nearing $1 million dollars.  sweet monkey lips, get on and play for your piece, man...
this oscar pre-game coverage is pretty over-the-top cheeseball.  do they have to be this much? just act like normal human beings. jeez. ha.

@Tattytats seems like it really takes a lot of effort to get on that list, man.
what do you say @melyssagrace?  do you like my boy @DeanRandy?  busted tournament today, but can pick you up at commerce for him tmrw if so.
officially depressed about being out of la wpt. was having a blast playing and playing pretty well today. bummer.
Last hand is eating at me. Out w QQ in 3 way pot. Action was substantial and interesting. Been talking it w/ @PrahladFriedman and @Roothlus
Tale of two half-days. Won every pot first half, then lost every pot second half, culminating in getting trapped badly on my bust hand. Out.
An Ace on the river and up to 73k after busting a very angry young man. Thank you @barrygreenstein, not for raising me, but your book title.
@Tattytats i can't even be considered?!
Queen on the river and i'm up to 66k.
@JasonMercier dude, obv. Just busting on you. Gonna get out to hermosa for some rball while in town?
@ScottBHuff @barrygreenstein par for the course. At least he wrote it, usually he would just think it. ;)
Sitting on about 44k from starting of 30k. Hit a few hands.
1st level over at Commerce. Already surpassed last WPT, Bellagio, where I busted in 40 min. I know, I know, but hold your applause, pls. ;)

@WPTSEUSS all good, brotha.  ;)
@Josht53 haha.  at least it's a good problem to have, friend!
@OnlyPolly yessss!  glad to hear.  :)
@TheTmay always welcome.  baller italian spot in mountain view too, not too far from bay 101, when we up there.
@WPTSEUSS @UB this is what gets me frustrated. i have literally answered this question 50 times.  'yes'.
@mattteed they just are who they are.  see what they want to see. hypocrites in every way. they attack others morals and have none. gross.
@renrad2332 love it, brother!  keep on it!
@mattteed i would go on any show other than theirs.  let's see what next week or so holds tho. won't be a debate tho, just him educating me.
@RichTRyan agreed.  just concerned for baron's well-being.  hope they have a suicide-watch outside his door.
@renrad2332 no, ub is all good, friend. no problems withdrawing etc that i am aware of.  travis stuff is old news. hope it all comes out tho
@acerman01 i will happily sit down with travis on ANY media show that isn't theirs. won't be a debate tho. just be travis educating me.
@OnlyPolly when we going to some shows?!
@mattteed i desperately hope that travis comes forward with everything he has. we need that info out there.
@mattteed interestingly, not as much as you would think. very little new to me. media twists it in diff ways, but hasn't changed much.
@mattteed no worries.  ;)
@mattteed Brad was refunded. They can check against their HH's. Brad is a friend and I am dealing with him directly, friend.

@JuJu_ATF gl brother!  always sending juju some love!  you know this!
@kbinferno 1010 v 99, 9 on the river...flush draw on the turn, but i had his suits covered... funny thing is i misclicked call initially!
ouch, just got two-outed on @UB in my sniper tournament tonight on the river for a 65k stack.  still in with about 23k.
@pokerCK still early, bud!  ;)
@BUSTERU86 they gotta hit the "rotate" button!
blog from Paul Leggett from @UB on current Travis Makar developments: http://blog.ub.com/2011/02/temp-title/ hoping Travis releases all info
@Lara_Miller wow.  really??  that is surprising, my dear...
@Run2SaveLives put me down for $100, chris.  :)
@Williams0909 just once.  warriors game again.  was too young and didn't go much to nba in 90's.  i shoulda!  ha.
@Williams0909 yep, met him at a hawks/warriors game in oakland, prolly like '88ish.
@Williams0909 atlanta hawks. met 'nique when i was a kid, plus was always smallest player on my teams so had kinship for spud webb. haha.
@Williams0909 for sure.  no argument there on duncan...
i don't know why i dislike the spurs so much.  i just do.  they are impossible to root for unless you are already a fan.
@RweAsleep @bryanmicon @donkdown what's to hate? these guys chase pictures of dicks for a living. feel bad for, maybe, but hate? no way.
@FrankGiaramita you don't get it. that is a small piece of info. everything else is much bigger. names, hh's, cheats. we want that out.
@Tyresias blog forthcoming.
@stryker1313 haha, i feel you brotha.  ahhhhh, the good old days.  ;)
@Mark_Gahagan gets old when people see 1 thing & think they know whole story. shit is insanely layerd. things aren't always what they appear
@Mark_Gahagan why? you think they never spoke? no one ever said anything like that. i believe the email is real personally.
@gobbomom more than one side to this story.  i'm pretty proud of what we've accomplished since i signed actually.
@JonAguiar blog forthcoming.
@Mark_Gahagan that was excapsa. they have been/in process of totally being shed.
i don't think people quite understand always. current UB ownership WANTS this information out. we don't have it. we want it released.
Travis Makar, if reading this, please release ALL information that you have.  We want this information out in the open for all to see.
hectic day ya'll.  comments/blogs, etc. forthcoming on the recent Travis Makar developments.

@Casy151 @dirtydw people like dirty just continually undermine the cause, christy. go read some of his page. they hurt the truth and make...
@Jason good luck this week in the bay area my friend.  hope all kicks ass...

@WriterJen @lance_bradley great for you.  good stuff.  ;)

album of the day, Yeah Yeah Yeahs/"Fever To Tell"
@Casy151 ty brotha. is interesting travis surfaced all of a sudden. we tried to get in touch with him to no avail before.
@Casy151 agree with a lot of what you're saying, believe me. i will never lie and as info comes out, it will def be attended to.
@Casy151 i agree. i feel you. if anything comes out, it will be addressed. believed me. is always someone saying they have stuff is all.
@Casy151 the same as it's been. someone says they have stuff. if it ever materializes, it will be commented on. been going on for yrs now.
@Casy151 not ignoring anything. nothing new if you've been following everything. when something concrete comes out it'll be commented on.
i think i've developed my super power this weekend.  it seems like it's the ability to not get hung over. is coming in handy today.  ;)

Question: what is the guitar/keyboard instrument called from the 80's?! Don't act like you don't know what i'm talking about. Little help!

@DeanRandy @mattpalmer11 true dat! ;)
Gross. @mattpalmer11 just said i am just like Peter Klaven from "I Love You Man". Made me angry. We are taking votes. Yeay or nay?

Mmmmmm. Tacos are good for the soul...
"indecent proposal" is on. whole vegas scene at the beginning is so brutal.  the desperation. the losing. man, seen that in some eyes before

@Angeleenie equally as awesome.  touche.  ;)
album of the day, Modest Mouse/"Good News For People Who Love Bad News"
i want to get an iced mocha from catalina coffee, but in truth, i am scared to do so.
@veeRob was at commerce earlier. Not cool of you to not be there when i am, man.
Having fun at @CommerceCasino, hanging with @jesswelman, @SavagePoker, and @jdnewitt. Feels like 2007 all over again.
@Sootie2012 absolutely. :) no worries... Gl out there!
@therealJboog @PrahladFriedman @UB sickkkkkk!  happy to have you on board, brotha... :)
@Hollywood_Dave @UB i hate you.  but it is true.  i did something reallllllly bad in a past life.

@brunocr nooooo.  has to get better then, right?!

@AngelCityBeer i actually didn't drink ANY on sunday.  def sushi dinner.  for sure.  :)  maybe this weekend?
@bobbitto funny, thats is EXACTLY what we did compensate him with.  ;)
@AngelCityBeer ahhhhh, now i got it.  ;)  yumyum...
i obviously emptied my @UB account to him to keep things quiet. let's see how it goes.  haha.  #HEYO
some dude just sent me photo-shopped pic of suited aces on @UB. fake, and not even a great one. wants "compensation". haha. love my job.  ;)
@Scott_Ian @UB boom goes the dynamite, to the master of sng's himself!

@ScottBHuff Wavy Gravy quote?

@IDFC1 pleasure to play with you, bud...

@jesswelman dude, when we gonna see you round hermosa way?
grinding some 45-player sng's on @UB. come and get in the action. you will dominate. i NEVER cash in these.  like ever. ;)
@JasonMercier @DanOBrienPoker i believe this is a challenge of some sort.  rball courts in hermosa during lapc. a block away from the pad...
@ZenX1 dark towers are right after IT. So incredible...
Just picked up 'IT' by S King. Probably my 2nd fave book ever. Fired up to read it again. I remember cowering when i was 13, the first time.
"...will there be someone to save your truth for you..?"
@UFOUNDBOBO unbelievable.  you know what to do with that one.  i told you she was nothing but trouble.  ;)
@runwicked stop lying.  that's clearly not a tv.  i remember that little guy from the bar scene in 'star wars'.
you know what sucks? running out of red velvet cookies, going to the store to get more and them being out of said cookies. that sucks...
@EricMizrachi @UB @TrishelleC well, get in there, e!
playing 45-player sng's on @UB with ms @TrishelleC.  she is taking my chips and laughing at me.  it hurts.
@runwicked your twitter hacked?  i got a DM from you, but don't want to click it.  seems hacked...
awesome sesh of racquetball with @wickedbecool.  got out A LOT of aggression that was abrewing...
they gave the key to dallas to mike vick? god, that's asinine. appreciate he's changed + rehabilitated, but come on, don't honor him. #dumb
i have to say that i am super pumped for Aaron Rodgers today. class act at Cal, class act in the pros. dude deserves every bit of this....
@chazbeaner so pumped for you, dude.  you're gonna have such a crazy sick amazing time...
album of the day, Ted Leo & the Pharmacists/"Shake The Sheets"
@ericnewby agreed.  ted leo it is.
I am terrifyingly full of grub. I think SB now dwarfs Thanksgiving in terms of my food consumption. Need a wheel barrow.
Headed over to @ScottBHuff's place for a little super bowl pre-party. Instead it's a directv phone party as his tv is down. #SBfail
Today i will begrudgingly root for the Packers, for my @calathletics boy Aaron Rodgers. It stings as a Bears fan though...
album of the day, Pearl Jam/"Vs."
just finished 'social network' for the many-eth time. incredible movie. such a microcosm/synopsis for our times and how we live in them.
Ugh @calathletics losing in triple overtime to Arizona by 2. Man, brutal one, boys... Ouch, Bears.
i forget often, but i am so thankful for all i have in my life; the friction and the calm, the madness and the sanity. it's all worth it.
Closing time on Saturday... http://yfrog.com/h8nkolej
random nutball quotient is going up exponentially today!  it's impressive.  ;)
Morning racquetball session with @wickedbecool, followed up by a little lunch at Catalina Coffee.
I'm watching "Cloverfield". Yes, i'm one of the few people who thought this was an interesting movie. I dig it. So what? Ha. :)
Lol paciugaments.

poker players, don't forget about the #UBOC championship $1milly guaranteed tomorrow on @UB.  gonna be a fun one.  see ya there...
@AlCantHang @Scott_Ian i will be there for sure, unless i am still hungover, which is a definite possibility, friends...
drinking 3 bottles of wine and playing online poker all night is not advisable, for those of you out there.  ugggggh, my head is death.
@mlindsley no worries!  super fun time.  hope you're crushing it!
min-cashed my tourney on @UB tonight.  i'm disappointed after all the wine i have drank.  :(
"...you gotta live my life to get boots like these..."
@Poff that sounds amazing!  i like it.
@DeanRandy in and in.  maybe we can watch @mattpalmer11 disintegrate again?!  ;)
@mattteed ballers are out tearing up the night.  i am drinking wine and chillin on @UB.  someone just told me to get aids.  seems bad.
@DeanRandy you deserve one!  haha.  when we hanging again?
@DeanRandy i'll work on it.  let me see what i can pull together.  ;)
@DeanRandy i knew you were one of the good guys.  i knew it.
@DeanRandy homie!  where you at?  conspicuously little trash talk after your Packer win...appreciated...
9.15pm, friday night.  what to do?  grocery store run or drink wine and play on @UB?  yep, that's right, my life is bangin'.
Quote of the day, from @wickedbecool, "hey, have you ever seen a successful hater?" Zing! Awesome!
@kristincool you were just barely late...like a day.  :(  @wickedbecool scooped it, but i think you know him, so maybe can get a cup or two?
@DeeSanchez @jvfricke @SavagePoker easy.  there are two that i know, "naked fish" and "sen of japan" that i know of...
@Willing2Die @MattCWaldron just made me el oh el with this one.
@pokerkat @joeseebok except on the correct spelling of my name.
@BJNemeth @mattcwaldron agreed. just pointing out it skews things, that's all.
@MattCWaldron or it would be like tom brady pulled out of the pats, signed with nike, and they got to insert him into EVERY super bowl.
@MattCWaldron wrong. it would be like if nike had a rookie they supported so they kept putting him in the super bowl.
@MattCWaldron great example. would be if tom brady got invited to those AND they counted in his lifetime stats. would be unfair, yes?
@MattCWaldron dude, your logic isn't right here. we'll agree to disagree. let's chat about in at lapc.
@MattCWaldron you're acting like pro sponsorships/appearances affect win/loss and championships in pro sports. they don't.
@MattCWaldron you're confusing stats with $ opps. in poker all we have are wins and total $ won. that's it. you are bleeding the two.
@MattCWaldron i gotta disagree, homie. poker events aren't really picked by ability sadly, simply by who has the money to spend.
@MattCWaldron dude, no it doesn't.  the yankees/heat, etc don't play more games and get to pad their stats. what are you talking about?
@MattCWaldron hey, i'm not shirking those poker players. they are great! just saying, the numbers are irrevocably skewed.
@MattCWaldron they do? they get to play in games other players do not?  where are those? all star games?  playoffs? those #'s don't count.
@MattCWaldron terrible analogy. football and baseball players all have the same opportunities. our "sport" isn't like that.
@MattCWaldron not saying abolish it. just saying the leaders will continue to be in a select group is all & they will continue to pull away.
@MattCWaldron agreed.  no perfect system.  but at least they have to beat out a legit field where anyone can buy-in.
@ScottBHuff i ride my bike around hermosa.  wanna fight?
ok, irrelevant isn't the correct word. skewed? tainted? obv all great players. just tough to break into that club regularly.
@MattCWaldron it's an exclusive club is all i'm saying. hard to break way in regularly w/o a stars or tilt after your name.
anyone else think these super high roller events in poker have made the "all-time money" lists totally and completely irrelevant?
@TiffnyMichelle well, why wouldn't it be all done up like that.  i mean, dying IS awesome!  right?  right?
@JasonMercier get it on out to the beach for some hangtime in hermosa and rball.  let's rally @DanOBrienPoker
it really is good to be @JasonMercier, isn't it?  when we gonna see you out LA way?
well, hello friday.  nice to see you.  album of the day, Ben Harper & Relentless 7/"White Lies For Dark Times"

anybody know what's up with the @STS9 shows being canceled in LA?
@Scott_Ian basically the same thing.
@Scott_Ian dude?!  where's the next show? looks like another planet?!  ;)
really not into this whole 10 films being nominated for 'best picture' thing.  keep it tight at 5, me thinks...

@runwicked @ScottBHuff huff could be the other side of my "couple", but i don't see that happening really...
said it before & i'll say it again. LOVE getting random twitter hate & then writer's page is ALL hate to everyone. enjoy life, guy. ;) ha.
@runwicked @ScottBHuff would love to go, but it's a couples trip this year and @Dyelly13 can't swing it in '11.  :(
@danaworkman you'll find something to get into.  weirdly i was supposed to leave for london tomorrow, but trip was canceled.
@danaworkman clearly not looking hard enough.  it's london, dude...
unless jay cutler has AIDS of the knee, he is going to have some explaining to do.  i'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now tho...
hell of a 4th quarter run, bears.  this kid hanie has heart.  love the bears.  congrats pack...
FIRST DOWN BEARS
4th & 1 for a shot.  just need a shot!  #chibears
wow.  here we go!  let's do this chicago! #chibears
hmmmmm...impressive drive...let's hold the phone for a second...
well, that's gonna about do it.  bummer bears couldn't put up more of a fight.  have to wait to hear story on cutler.  congrats pack fans...
@genebromberg agreed.  no future for him in chicago if he doesn't need a leg replacement.
touchdown!  is this even possible?  with the dynamics of this game and how bad the bears have played, we are only down 7...
wow, jay cutler.  wow.  nfc championship game.  watching in spanish so i can't hear a thing, but that injury should have to be pretty bad.
was just typing that if bears can score before halftime that could be a game-changing pick. then cutler threw his.  sigh... #comeback
not sure if i'm playing @PrahladFriedman's 2k tourney later on @UB tho.  gonna wait and see how the Bears game is going...
also, rooting the @NHLBlackhawks in to a comeback victory as well.  good memories seeing them play the Flyers today... #stanleycup
playing a mess of #uboc tournaments on @UB today and rooting the @chicagobearscom to a win and berth in the super bowl! #gobears

@oskargarcia i would think it would have to to include big names and well known tv pros.
@Kevmath @Balsbaugh i would think so, yes, kevmath. most big names would have to not make the cut with a recent success formula.

@wphsu no argument.
not a great #uboc day for me on day 1. built up some stacks on @UB, but lost the really large, critical pots to get crippled. onto the next!
definitely got what i wanted today: 1) a bears win, 2) solid @UB action in #uboc and, 3) a good game between jets/pats.  great sunday.
lotta falcons, ravens, and seahawks fans! RT @basebaldy This #UBOC 3 is perfect for Sunday tilt. 3 minute levels with $100k prize pool gtd!
hate that call by the jets.  not gonna win by being conservative.  no chance.
bring on the packers!  so pumped for next weekend now!  #chicagobears
@eggjuggler don't you still owe me from our last wager, game 1 this year?
@amak316 wow. incredible game next week.  gonna be a war.  pumped for it!
man, cutler really is scary when he's playing well. being utilized correctly now, and he's reigned himself in. could be a great qb...
@PokerRoadNews that word should be misspelled, it's "stanfurd", just fyi...
haha, sorry hasselback, you don't get a pass interference on EVERY play...
@Djskippy22 @checkeater. how's that rooting for the seahawks thing working out for you cats?
@martyfree love chicago sports!  lived in illinois until i was about 8 or so.  grew up rooting for bears, cubs, illini, etc...
@mattteed yep, there are minis as well.  get in some!
@runwicked @Dyelly13 oooooooh, such a tease.
@99problemsPR pack looked great last night.  i was rooting for them...
@DeanRandy @basebaldy things are shaping up very interestingly...

@amak316 yep, we been talking about it.  let's get through next week hopefully and revisit though...
@DeanRandy costa rica for next two weeks, sir.  rough life, i know...
@DeanRandy i would be massively massively interested.
@eggjuggler true, it was humiliating when you barely won last week in a game that meant nothing to us in your house. pls win next week.
@DeanRandy let's both win next week and get this thing ON for the nfc!
@amak316 maybe we'll get lucky and get a rematch for the nfc this year.  wow, that game would be sick, sick, sick fun.
knew we shoulda knocked out the stupid packers when we had the chance last week.#chicagobears
@AlCantHang that would be a definite yes, my friend...

@AndrewWiggins let me give you one back then. worth it for the jersey alone. ;)
Just bet @runwicked $50 to eat 5 whole jalapeno slices. He's physically crying now. Money well spent.
taco tuesday, i lean on yee.
@mattteed you're telling me. is the bane of my existence.  ha. couldn't possibly suck more. don't think that would sway people tho, honestly
@mattteed the problem is that he is so biased. peeps biased for or against to that level are basically useless. that's on either side.
@mattteed i actually don't know that cat. Seems to be somewhat knowledgable tho. Obv we disagree on many points tho.
@RatPackPoker @TrishelleC @_absolutepoker @UB of course.  the answer is no. see my blogs for last 18 months regarding it pls.
@LArunr of course.  no worries... beyond hilarious movie.
@LArunr wow.  incredible.  i have it.  but way down here, bud.
the south bay racquetball triumvirate is complete.  carnage will ensue regularly, @grahamburford @wickedbecool
@BUSTERU86 i do not agree with him, obv.  check my blogs for specifics.  UB is doing just fine.  you have nothing to worry about, sir.
@pokrdan new ownership. pls go read some of my blogs and research a bit, homie. i've already said this countless times.
@pokrdan @mattteed the concerns are def valid. how could this be proven? we've invited people down to visit, etc. hasn't been taken up on.
@mattteed sure.  np.  just send me an email and i will look into it for you.  just include the situation in it.
@mattteed no problem at all. i will ALWAYS sit down with anyone who is reasonable and talk about ANY of these issues.
@mattteed i choose to not comment on things i don't know anything about, but many others do not. people like to be led, even if it's wrong.
@mattteed unless one is in the company, close to the company, or done tireless research (haley, etc) they are just mouthing off usually.
@mattteed it really is mob mentality at it's best. the truth is that almost no one has any clue what they are talking about with all of this
@mattteed i get out as much as i can. only can try and keep improving things. company, understandably, doesn't always release bizness info.
@SaraUnderwood i like the misspelling better actually.  we spell it 'stanfurd'.  have fun...
@mattteed i understand people's feeling towards UB, i really do, but it doesn't make true what they want to be true. it just doesn't.
@mattteed hating a company that made a lot of mistakes is very understandable, but it doesn't make the old regime still in power.
@mattteed if they are, why can't someone show me something? seems fishy. seems much more likely some people just hate UB, which i get too.
@mattteed if someone can indicate that they are still there, i wish they would send it to me. been begging for it for about 18 months.
@mattteed see countless blogs/interviews i have done. everything i have seen/been told indicates they are out. i believe they are out.

@NoahSD ok, you can email me. we already explained what happened.  don't think anyone lost much on that, to be honest with you. we refunded
@LeoWolpert hey man, i wish i had a stranglehold on the industry the way the forums seem to.  trust me.  happy ny!
@NoahSD shoot me an email and i will look into it personally for you.
@LeoWolpert was giving you guys a compliment, dude.  relax.  ;)
@NoahSD did you email me, bud?
i will say one thing about the poker forums: a tiny minority has managed to somewhat stranglehold an entire industry & that is impressive.

@DJstuckIN215 definitley is a shitty answer, but what if it's the truth? blows, but if it's true, it's true...
@AlCantHang you and i should roll in each year in human sized bottles of jaeger.
@DJstuckIN215 absolutely. all i can do is improve the company as much as i can tho. if i thought they were lying to me, i would leave
@mattteed ha, i feel you.  you'll be just fine.  big announcement next week.  stay tuned!  pretty exciting...
@DJstuckIN215 former owners are no longer there and haven't been for long time. current regime made mistakes, no doubt, but no cheating.
@mattteed definitely not.  we are healthy and doing just fine.
wishing both @annieduke and @phil_hellmuth the best of luck with everything in the future.  pleasure working with both...

@mattteed no.  i'm saying that the kgc conducted the investigation and contacted authorities. i don't have that information.

@wwants i appreciate your point tho.  just can't roll on that site, it's just all my gf this and my dad that and f*ck joe sebok, yada, yada.
@wwants unfortunately i have been down that road and it is just a beat down for me.  if i could actually participate i would have long ago.
@Brooke_Ives hell yes!  that is awesome!  just send me a pic!  i'm super flattered.  :)
@Haley_Hintze i hear you, haley.  as usual if anything was ever proven to me, it would be a different situation, obv.
@wwants haha.  touche.  ;)  trying to fix all that, but i certainly feel your discouragement...
@wwants consider adam + mike friends, but they'd be hard pressed to deny that you have to sift through the bullshit over there to find gold
@wwants totally agree with that. love the reasonable, intelligent people at 2+2, they just make up less than 5%, which both adam + mike know
@wwants problem is that people want ridiculous things. to come in and audit whole company, which no privately owned company would EVER do.
@wwants no, i think they want to, but is a difficult road because of past mistakes. just having me here speaks to that, imo.
@ilMaKeUfAmOuS agreed. has to be impartial group is all. no one that wants to PROVE or DISPROVE anything. gotta be neutral & just want truth
@vibhu  @veerob ty for the tech help. hopefully we can simply get a third party in soon to confirm findings. much appreciated tho, vibhu
@wwants definitely gets very convoluted. working on a third party being allowed access so we can simply lock down the facts...

@JeffMadsenobv agreed.  definitely. youthful BEHAVIOR, but just not youth. that can't be felt again. ever. close, but not the same, i think.
@runwicked @lara_miller it's that feeling of true discovery. genuinely not knowing what's ever next & discovering EVERYTHING for first time.
@runwicked @lara_miller ultimately wouldn't be as magical if we could recreate it. if we got more than 1 shot, would lose so much.
@runwicked @lara_miller it's beautiful, but not the same as childhood. adult adventures are incredible, but don't have the wonderment.

@dirtydw however i go on many shows and do many interviews and debates. i don't dodge questions or inquiries. i'm sure you can catch those.
@dirtydw i've talked to him on several occasions. unfortunately i won't be on their show again and they won't be on PRR for other reasons.
Even that can be hard sometimes though. I am in awe of so many who go through so much and still come out fighting. My life is so easy...
Life is crazy. Crazy & beautiful. So many things happen you can't control. All you can often do is do the best with what you've got.
It is just insane how much shit goes on in our country, and the world, at any given time. It can be mind boggling...
