It looked like people chose The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather as the greatest movies over all. What about the greatest comedy?
That pic was way too old to be using it.
Some of my favs r Devil's Advocate, Gladiator, Malcolm X, Coming to America, Usual Suspects & The Hurt Locker.
#harrypotter killed the box office this past weekend. Since I'm on the subject.. What's the greatest movie of all time?
Got some good work in today! Making my next move for the day.

What's all the fuss about this morning? I woke up to a ton of emails, texts and missed calls.
Good night everyone! There's still a lot on my mind. Hopefully something to help me will come in my dreams one of these nights....
Today is a GREAT day!
The days are passing by a lot quicker now. It's always like that when you have to make a BIG decision.
Having a blast with the fam for long weekend. Going to see my grandmother. 92 yrs young! I'm sure she's gonna treat me like a little kid.
Going to bbq #2! Happy 4th everyone!
Got the chance to clear my mind today. Church and Sunday dinner with the fam was awesome!
Finally back in my environment. #freeagency has been a whirlwind. This decision is not going to be easy...
I'm done with my visits... For now at least. I need some rest.
Chicago's next. This is the last of the day.
I finally get a break to have a late lunch. It's madness outside.
Finished with the Knicks. Another impressive one. I'm starving!
I'm up and at 'em! My shirt is starched and I'm ready for more business. NY Knicks are next
I don't film my meetings. I am a professional. Having control of your own media is a distraction, but when other networks do it, it's not?

The time is finally here. Thank you for all the support. I'm nervous, but I'm excited and READY! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!!!!!
I've been watching this clock and it won't speed up!
My cousin wants me to go to a certain team. I won't name the team he said, but it's funny how I can't get away. Lol
Only 120 mins till this thing kicks off. I wonder if anything is going happen after 12:01...
Bout to hang out and have dinner with my family. I'm sure free agency will be a big topic of discussion at some point.
The day has been moving extremely slowly. It's always like that when something important is coming up!

Congrats to the NBA Champion Lakers. The last game game of the season was the best one.
Wow! This is crazy!
Now the Lakers are playing great defense
Missed free throws can come back and bite you at the end
You can feel the tension building. Anybody think it's going down to the last shot?
This game has been at Boston's pace. They wanna slow the game down and force the Lakers to play against their set defense.
The Lakers seem like they're the nervous team. Kobe and Pau have to have to get into it offensively to win.
Celtics off to a good start. Their defense impregnable defense in on right now.
Seems like they're gonna let them play tonight. It's going to be very physical
Ready for this Game 7! It's going to be a historical night.
Sittin with my boys from high school and talkin about old time. I forgot all about some of the stories I'm hearing right now. Lol!

I know I'm late, but I never tweeted it. R.I.P. John Wooden. A basketball legend. I am proud to say I had the pleasure of meeting him.
Is that oil spill still going? Seriously... How long has it been now?
Just finished working out with my boy Pops Mensah-Bonsu. He's fresh off the plane from Moscow.
Would everyone follow "Turtle" if he was on twitter? I'm trying to convince him to get on... Pause
I'll try to manage. I'll be better in a week
Another great game in the books. Big Baby was ballin' tonight. Pivitol Game 5 next. That's going to intense
I gotta hurry up and get back so I can catch Game 4.
Might do dinner at another steakhouse again tonight.
Headed back today. Its been a great trip!
Life is awesome!
Afternoon! Had a great lunch earlier. Going back to the Entourage set today to hangout.
Man! This is tense! Nothing like a game that goes down to the last possession. This is why I love basketball!
Leonardo DiCaprio is the most hype guy watching the game in here. He truly loves ball.
Strong defense on both sides. This is going down to the wire.
Lakers still doing well. I'm sure it'll get closer when Ray Allen works himself in the game.
The Lakers look focused.
Bout to watch the game with my buddy Doug Ellin. Should be a good one.
On set at Entourage. Can't wait for the new season. Brushing up my acting skills.
Just left the @treyarch studios and saw a few levels of Call of Duty Black Ops. It looks sick! Thanks @JD_2020for the tour.

Starting another cool day. Meeting with funny or die in a few.
The premire was great! The Karate Kid is a great movie. It made me feel like a kid again.
Hung out with some cool people last night, but I won't name drop. On our way to the Karate Kid premier.
The piano guy in this resturant is doing a jazz version of Love in this Club. Funny thing is that it sounds good.
The Celtics played well. Great game.
Enjoying the game. Much better in person.
Is this a little too much? #lifeblogging http://j.mp/ccZ7tv

Sittin here watchin the game. I'm gonna have to make sure I schedule my vacation a lot later next year.
@mopete24 what up bro? How's summer going?
Reading a book called "Secrets of Mental Math" #stillanerd
Still on vacay having a blast. Big decisions to make very soon.  Sorry for the short absence, but my mind has been everywhere.
Orlando is still fighting. That was a long game.
Finally arrived to my destination. I'm about to get a cold drink and chill out
Bout to head outta here for vacay. I hope no one asks me where I'm going next yr. It'd be nice to get away for a while.
Having a poolside BBQ. I love the summer
Boston is still rollin
Saw some kids on their way to prom. That brought back some memories. I wonder where my prom pics are.
Shopping for some swimming trunks. We're taking a vacation soon.

@DeMar_DeRozan I've never seen you in a suit, rook.
I didn't know the lottery rules were that complicated.
The NBA draft lottery is about to come on. I forgot all about it.
Why is listening to the radio so hard to do? It's either the same songs or a lot of commercials
Waiting for the arrival... Has nothing to do with basketball in case you're wondering.
Late night dominoes!
Kobe is on fire right now
Had a great nap. Up just in time for the game.
Man! I am truly and honestly out of shape. Lol
Morning! I'm feeling pretty good today. I'm gonna make some breakfast and go work out today.

Great game. This is going to be a classic series.
Man! This is a physical game. Boston is playing them well.
Boston's comin' out swinging!
Chillin at the house. Game time in an hour or so. I'm starved to basketball right now!

That was a surprising series. Boston and Orlando next. That'll be another great one.
Man! Celtics are rollin! Tough to stop good team ball
It looks like its loud in Boston
I think I'll try cooking. I have some time. Game doesn't come on for another couple hours.

Orlando ran away with it. They're looking pretty good.
Just to be clear. I never said that I'm not considering staying in Toronto.
Sitting, waiting and reading. I might get to see some family today.
Thinking about getting an ipad. Anyone out there have one? What do you think about it?
Getting ready to watch the game. I have some decent seats.
Sitting here watching the games wishing I was playing. I wonder if that MVP trophy is heavy?
My first time making ESPN or ABC this year! Thank you Mr. Wilbon and Mr. James.
Ok... Let me rephrase the question. Should I stay or should I go?
Been wanting to ask. Where should I go next season and why?
What's up everyone?
About to watch the game soon. Fingers are crossed.
