@ethank Highlander 2 is terrible. This is purely “meh”.
@ethank I thought it was fine. But by all accounts it should have been terrible! Or never released!
I’m:  a) happy the film editing category didn’t get cut   b) glad the ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ guy won. No matter what you think of the film, the fact that it was even coherent even though the director got fired halfway though is maybe the most derserving editing award ever. #Oscars
That was inevitable. Field was too wide open. “Safest” choice wins. #Oscars

Still, they are in a position of power here with a pre-installed app/service. Now they’ll undoubtedly look to gain leverage with the roll-out with or without everyone on board.
Warning: lot of “seems” ahead: But this *seemed* like a straightforward one, given the Texture buy. But Apple always *seems* to come in too aggressive, which doesn’t *seem* to work as well post-Jobs era.
But really, the song remains the same with Apple. They fail to garner full support for an offering at launch, so they’ll go ahead and try to force everyone else’s hand. Sometimes this works (iTunes), sometimes it does not (remember TV passes?).

So while Apple may have thought they were moving towards her strengths in fashion and retail, turns out someone from Nike (where Cook is on the board, remember) may have ultimately been a more seamless fit. Still seems like she had good success in her time, though!

@MattRosoff @CaseyNewton Right, nothing. (Anytime soon.) Hence, “too extreme here” but the key point is around leading/lagging indicators. Today’s numbers are meaningless in that regard. And such numbers will be for a year or more.   Anyway, the answer to the question is Instagram 😝

@rabois @CaseyNewton For sure. Those other services will now very quietly slink their way over to TestFlight...
@rabois @CaseyNewton And their extremely disingenuous statements — once again — just exacerbate all of this — once again. WTF is going on over there?!
@rabois @CaseyNewton And fine, they can disagree with the rules, or say they’re anti-competitive or something. But in the situation Facebook has found itself in this past year, it’s absolutely inexcusable to do something like this. It’s also just stupid from a business-perspective, ultimately.
@rabois The tracking issue is a red herring (assuming people opted in, which is questionable with children involved per @CaseyNewton), the issue is Facebook once again doing something shady — something they know to be shady — rather than following the rules.
@rabois And what if the local authorities told you that you were no longer allowed to do that, and banned such people from coming in the front door, so instead you set up operations around back of the Starbucks?
@stevecheney @dannytwetes Yeah. If they shut off TestFlight access (which would be a first, I assume!) that would be a pretty bold statement by Apple. Obviously they can’t shut off App Store access. Well, they can! But would they dare! We will see!
@stevecheney Oddly (we’ll, not oddly) they distribute Instagram betas through TestFlight. Just like everyone else not trying to hoover up other app usage data...
@romaindillet God forbid Facebook be subject to that 😜
@nbashaw I generally agree. But it’s all about platform norms. Mobile device much more personal than TV (private messages, etc). Facebook just violated those in a major way.
@nbashaw @round Well I think Apple’s move to block (before Facebook “pulled”) says all we need to know...
@nbashaw Not necessarily, of course. But they had to know what they were doing was in violation of Apple’s terms. Which is shady.
@romaindillet Can you not distribute VPN apps via TestFlight?
In other words, they tried to re-create Onavo in a subtle, quiet way after they knew such an app would no longer be allowed by Apple for “regular” distribution. At least, that’s certainly how it looks!
And I’m honestly not sure about the non-nefarious stuff here. Because if they were using it to log other apps on the device (which TestFlight distribution presumably limits access to), that’s really, really bad.
@stevekovach Right, exactly. I assume their excuse would be user number limitations. But regardless, they knew this was a no-no for Apple. It’s why Apple bought and relaunched TestFlight, to serve this purpose (beta distributions).
So yeah, those statements by FB seem pretty disingenuous once again. They had to know this was a no-no in Apple’s book. And were doing it anyway. One would hope ultimately for non-nefarious reasons. But regardless, it just looks really bad. Again!
As has been reported, the enterprise distibution method allows the ent (in this case, Facebook) to basically own a device and everything on it. Not just within that app (which is the point of TestFlight for “regular” beta testing with outside users).
The most damning thing about this latest Facebook fiasco is using Apple’s enterprise distribution system. Companies used to do that to side load before Apple relaunched TestFlight. Was it to get around the user number limits? Regardless, it looks shady! https://t.co/XOQKWW8d7h

“There are many mentions of ‘bundle subscription’ in this beta, which makes us believe this can be a part of Apple’s plan to release an all-in-one media subscription which will include Apple Music, TV shows and magazines.”  ‘Apple Prime’ step one. 🧐 https://t.co/8UCC5dJ8ad

@justincox Think so, but obviously lots of ads on FB that don’t move over (most of them). Same data behind it, but IG format/concept works much better for this (but there will be backlash to this eventually too).
@justincox I think Instagram is a different (and brilliant) beast.
@mcken Well yes and no. “Relevant” here implies something you want to see, which implies something you want to buy.
It’s easy to say that people want more relevant ads versus less relevant ones. Seems obvious. But I’m just not sure it’s that black-and-white. I think a large number of people just don’t care. They absolutely care about ‘free’, relevancy seems more of a ‘whatever, if you must’.
I obviously don’t know the actual answer to this. But gut instinct — and the fact that I’ve clicked on *a lot* of these GDPR boxes while traveling — lead me to believe many folks are clicking just to dismiss, or don’t give a shit. Everyone quickly became numb to this stuff.
Overall, the Zuck op-ed seems fine. Pretty vanilla. “People like free stuff. This is how we give them free stuff.” But this strikes me as potentially disingenuous — is that *really* why the “vast majority” clicked, or were they just clicking-to-dismiss? https://t.co/tSnroJBHWG https://t.co/UibREnrwKG

@tomwarren I don’t know. But this is a great idea!
@mcwm @BenBajarin Wallet bust or bust. But it does suggest size matters! But rather than replace XR with iPhone Mini, perhaps they replace XS with mini. And “R” now stands for “Regular Size”.
@BenBajarin The other standout there is also poorly the XS is selling (relatively speaking)?
@kcoleman @pandemona I like the idea of Twitter having different “skins”. Like the crappy drawing skin. Like Winamp &amp; co back in the day. Also, while we’re at it: Hot Dog Stand theme, please.
@johnnie @gaberivera We watched one episode, @msquinn *hated* it (she’s basically like this already). I found it amusing, mainly in the family reactions to the ridiculousness. Also so I could start making the “spark joy” joke in good faith, unlike Gabe.
@rstephens @JasonHirschhorn https://t.co/wKG5hwiiEK
@gaberivera Does Twitter spark joy for you, Gabe? If not, say “thank you” and throw it away. Then you can fill that time with the Marie Kondo show. Problem solved. Joy sparked.
@stuartdenton Yep, far better than as a QB 😜
@JasonHirschhorn I know, I can just never get them to actually sync reliably. For like 4 years in a row now.
@CaseyNewton If the goal is to obscure the tweet to the point where you can’t actually tell what the content is, they’re doing a pretty good job. De facto “never tweet” - clever.

@davepell #toosoon
@ParkerOrtolani I also wonder if Apple wouldn’t do something like making the color options available for the “regular” to help differentiate the “boring middle”. And keep the Max more “Pro” like with just white/black/gold (for China). Mini colors would be a wild card in that scenario...

When you understand the trade-offs with editing tweets but at the exact same time, edit a Slack message and then get really angry about not being able to edit on Twitter. Maybe just allow for less than 10 character edits? A nice call back to constraints too?
Will never happen, of course. “Republicans buy sneaker too.” Again, we’re beyond that, and I’d play to take a stand and be on the right side of history. “Movies are an escape.” Sure. But silly award shows don’t have to be.  Make it meaningful.
Free idea for what is clearly going to be a pretty disastrous Oscars. Lin-Manuel Miranda hosting the entire thing as a not-so-subtle rebuke of Trump. “Hollywood our-of-touch.” “Shut up and act.” Yadda yadda. Go the other way. Use the podium. History will smile upon it.

@EricNewcomer Yeah for sure. Though I do think the water cooler effect is an interesting element they’ve captured when they effectively killed that in the past. We both watched it to be able to know what others are talking about.
@EricNewcomer The cost has gone from money (because you’re paying Netflix regardless) to time. At some point we may be pissed about that too (after too many turkeys) but not more than about money!
@EricNewcomer I agree. And — no joke — this is the actual brilliance of what Netflix did here. You and I watched this. Because others watched this. It’s not great. It would be killed in theater by Rotten Tomatoes and not being a tentpole. But on Netflix, it worked brilliantly.

@thesaddestview @paymonfarazi @stevesi @MikeIsaac Still holding out hope :)
@a_r_j_u_n_e @stevesi I know. But they’re... not really doing it? And to call it out again clearly seemed to be a note to Wall Street...
@kayvz 💯
@jshieber Correct. And they have been over time already — nice dividend. It’s just gonna be a slightly rocky transition from growth to full blue chip — especially when the company still wants to have a growth mindset (as all do — but few have $100B+ in cash to try to keep it going!)
@chriswb Haha yes! Was going to do yesterday. Now tomorrow :)
@stevesi @MikeIsaac Anyway that’s nothing new — the Braeburn stuff has been going on for years in the shadows. But I do suspect we see Apple start to change its M&amp;A philosophy, maybe even this year...
@stevesi @MikeIsaac People seem pissed about the continual stock buy backs (which I think was mostly debt anyway?) because we can’t see where else it’s going. Clearly somewhere! But been years at this point without enough obvious tangible things. And again, still too much cash in bank!
@stevesi @MikeIsaac There was one part I didn’t get to: which was Cook’s throwaway line about the cash and the plan to run it down. It almost reads as if he’s saying “we’re going to take a more Amazon-like approach now” to make Wall Street happy — but they just have SO much 💰.
@stevesi @MikeIsaac For sure. And Apple will set a new high mark for this, continually making what, $50B - $100B in *profit* a year? At the same time, as the most-owned stock, there will be immense pressure for big top line growth. And that era is over for now. “Dead” and loving it? :)

@jyarow Of course, two of the other four didn’t *exist* until the 90s.
Apple, now the 4th most valuable company in the world. 😳😬📉
@reneritchie I already have 2k words written on all this. But I have baby-brain, it’s a jumble, so will require about 10x the editing as usual. Tempted to stick to Twitter these days...
@reneritchie Sure seems like #2 but that seems like much bigger issue: phones are now “good enough” for most owners and just want better batteries... And so to combat, Apple is going to push more iPhone-as-a-Service plans. The whole thing is somewhere between bonkers and brilliant.
@gruber Definitely the strangest part of the whole note. It’s like: okay guys, looks good, let’s go with it — no, I think we need one more rationale — okay, just pick a random one.
@rjonesy I obviously largely agree but Wall Street won’t let them do that. As the most-owned stock... there will be immense pressure in the coming quarters/years.
@ethank @CaseyNewton I agree and again, that’s why “Priming” it is key. Mix good with mediocre in one package. As few options as possible (as Apple likes), maybe Music/TV are offered standalone to get more scale, but everything else should be bundled.
@grantgoodstein @CaseyNewton Yeah and I think that’s at least somewhat the plan eventually. The problem is to keep it simple it’s going to be *really* expensive. But, that’s Apple!
@seldo Apple running the entire thing (versus Citizens Bank or whatever) and bundling in Music, TV, iCloud, etc.
@CaseyNewton ...good things obfuscate the bad. And ultimately it’s iPaaS — iPhone as a Service, with all this stuff baked in ;)
@CaseyNewton I largely agree. I think they’ve done well with Apple Music (after stumbling at first), the iCloud prices are a joke, this new news thing clearly isn’t going to work at any meaningful scale (at the very least, not to Apple), etc. That’s why I think a “Prime” offering is key...
Lastly, don’t sleep on Apple Pay. The car is too far away. The glasses won’t be big enough any time soon (again, relative to iPhone). So Apple can either try to become an oil company, or a bank... 🍎💰 https://t.co/t0azfG2wpr
Fifth, I am bullish on the “Apple Prime” concept because the company has such loyal users (and great, unique products) but this will not be an easy strategy to execute upon. https://t.co/xxacksilR4
Fourth, did you catch the bit about trying to get more customers paying for and upgrading iPhones on a regular basis? This is “Apple Prime”. And it is coming. And given the above, I’d bet on sooner rather than later. https://t.co/rMS0y2tPNh
Third, did you hear Tim Cook say “services”? Because I did about 50 times. While growth there is awesome, the problem is that it’s still not the iPhone business (nothing is), which is ultimately what matters for the business and will for a loooonnng time. https://t.co/005X4mHfen
Second, again they try to chalk it all up to China, but it’s clear (albeit buried) that they’re having larger iPhone growth issues all over. This is the law of large numbers at work and was always inevitable. And it’s a big problem (relatively) going forward.
First, when is the last time Apple had to revise estimates? I can’t recall. After years of sandbagging, they’ve gotten more realistic in recent years. But they keep saying in the letter that they knew it would be a challenging quarter, but still missed badly. Not good.
Apple wants you to have two takeaways from this letter:   1) China 2) iPhone (particularly in China)  But there’s a bunch of other things buried in there... https://t.co/H2gHrQ1J5Z

@magicsilicon @benthompson @stevecheney @semil @DonaldRichard Right. That’s why I’m not a reporter anymore :) Any writing about startups is now usually just some high level thoughts about say, why one would invest. Leaving out perhaps why one would not ;)
@benthompson @stevecheney @semil @DonaldRichard Anyway, there’s just obviously a lot of downside and little upside for information holders. And if it’s a barter situation, still likely biased, etc.   And now here I am tweetstorming in another tweet storm thread. Even I’m lost. Will write about it someday ;)
@benthompson @stevecheney @semil @DonaldRichard And so what’s the benefit to the trusted information holders to share the full truth? Correct the public record? The greater good? Maybe in the case of something like Theranos, but that’s obviously an extreme.
@benthompson @stevecheney @semil @DonaldRichard That’s not to knock on reporters — that’s the job, and it’s hard — but it’s just seems impossible to report on such full information without obtaining said information and you can’t really do that without full trust. And round and round we go...
@benthompson @stevecheney @semil @DonaldRichard In a nutshell, this is 100% my experience moving from reporting to VC. Very, very few stories about startups paint a full picture. Or even close to one. It’s honestly usually a feat just to be directionally accurate. But neither reporters or the public often realize this!

@nrose @neilcybart @stevekovach Because there’s a far bigger game afoot! HomePod is competing in a space Sonos already lost but doesn’t know it yet. Apple bought Beats for the streaming service, the headphones were just icing on the cake. Branded icing, mind you.
@neilcybart @stevekovach I’ve made this case myself. (There’s always a post.) I’m no zealot here, my only aim is to be correct. https://t.co/yX1INs6VkP
@neilcybart @stevekovach Yes, it’s just a huge hit, clearly. Eagerly awaiting the press release. Or even the mention by anyone, anywhere. Any day now.
@JJDick1013 @neilcybart @stevekovach I don’t think they should have a cheap streaming stick, but I do think they dropped the ball in a major way with Apple TV as well.   1) https://t.co/vMSOhAczSI  2) https://t.co/pKMuijE0UQ
@neilcybart @stevekovach This product doesn’t move the needle. So what’s the point? Padding revenue in a tiny way? This is fine if it’s strategic. My core argument is that it’s not. They dropped the ball there...
@neilcybart @stevekovach Yeah, yeah even if that’s true, it’s a tired argument. As the (formerly) most valuable company in the world, Apple IS held to a higher standard. At the very least, they should hold themselves at such a place.
@neilcybart @stevekovach It’s not really an argument; the device is a flop. As was fairly easily predicatable since before day one. A cheaper one will come next year but that won’t ultimately matter if they don’t have the right mindset here. Which won’t be fully clear for a decade or so.
@neilcybart @stevekovach And yet, look at where Apple’s music-focused speaker is... Which you likely can’t. Because you likely can’t find one in the wild.
@neilcybart @stevekovach Sure, but Amazon and Google were interchangeable in that post. They both have roughly the same (correct) strategy for the space. Apple does not. Everything in there is more true today, with the HomePod in market. And yes, points to the strategy shift on (major) display this week.

@tvaziri A few weeks ago, you probably underestimated how many times i reference this film...
@frankba If I had known you knew the truth, I would have told the truth, you liar!
They’re basically now bragging that they didn’t get caught in a lie. WHEN THE TRUTH WAS TRYING TO GIFT A PENTHOUSE TO PUTIN.
Of course, they have no choice but to take this approach. The alternative was to lie in sworn testimony. So the “better” (read: only) option is to admit that they tried to broker a deal to give Putin a penthouse. Overplay to try to downplay. It’s insanity! 🤯
This is insane. This is the scene in ‘Clear and Present Danger’ where the President ducks the bad PR by saying he was “lifelong friends” with the drug runner. Except in the real world version, our President was on the boat with the dead drug runner. https://t.co/xwOl5FZ48T https://t.co/5F5xTbvPmm
@DILIPtheCHERIAN Oh yeah, no chance he goes quietly. But at some point it will flip on him and he’ll just make it worse on himself.

@harryh For sure. And until after the answers were submitted. Trump’s team is undoubtedly convinced they’ve played him, when they’ve been getting played the whole time. Like a fiddle. Because they’re fucking idiots.
On one hand, it continues to suck that we’ve had to live with the embarrassment of Trump for this long.   On the other, as Mueller’s methodical masterstroke is revealed, he has clearly used time to his advantage. A rush job could have left too many outs. This will be a burial.

I just feel like if the wait is going to be over say 20 minutes, conjure up some stairs and let people get off the plane the old school way. Or turn the plane around and fly to Oakland where they miraculously don’t seem to have such issues.
Update: it was an hour. And given that this has happened two of the last three times I’ve landed here, I assume @flySFO is the culprit. But entirely plausible that the blame is with @AlaskaAir in their continued ineptitude in managing the @VirginAmerica fleet they took over...
The joys of landing 15 minutes early, the agony of subsequently waiting on the plane for 45 minutes for a gate to open up.   SFO is such a shitshow.

@AlexRayTweets @jeffweiner Was a massive upgrade over last year. I like him, makes things happen. But McCaffrey &amp; Joe Milton are waiting and exciting for different reasons...
@bradsilverberg @jeffweiner He’ll be fine. This year was above expectations given that schedule. Beat MSU on road. Dominated WISC. Next year, that flips. And he’ll be *expected* to win 10-11 — and yes, OSU at home.
@jeffweiner Seems like a potential weakness of having no offensive coordinator. Play calling has been suspect for weeks. Patterson has largely hid it because he’s good at improvising.
OSU found the hole in the D early and exploited it. Their O-line looked great. Michigan was flat out out-coached and out-played. But the team will be better next year. Clearly need an offensive coordinator. Hope Patterson comes back. #GoBlue 🏈〽️
Ohio State played its best game and Michigan, its worst. Not sure any more nuance is needed than that. OSU had a far better gameplan and play-calling. #GoBlue 〽️🏈

@gruber I should say that I like Apple’s iPad  keyboards well enough but they’re too cumbersome. Especially the new one with wrap-around case... (only a week or so in, of course). Keys-to-Go works with iPhone too, of course...

Odd because they highlighted it earlier on screen as one of the “affordable” iPads... Implies it’s not dead. So maybe quiet spec update? 🤞 #AppleEvent

They seemed to imply that not many people were using the giant 12.9” iPad Pro. Which makes sense, it was comically large. Now same screen size in a much smaller package. #AppleEvent
No more Apple Pencil impaling-when-charging!! #AppleEvent
Apple has essentially pivoted the Mac Mini into a “Mac Mini Pro” as they should have. But impressive that it starts at $799. Makes sense why you get this versus the (forthcoming) Mac Pro, iMac Pro, etc. #AppleEvent
New Air looks great. Exactly what people want. Not entirely clear where it stands vs. the (still lighter, but more expensive) MacBook. Weird branding. Mild disappointment it doesn’t start at $999. #AppleEvent
Maybe they’ll rename the MacBook to the MacBook Helium? 😜 #AppleEvent
So the new MacBook Air is heavier than the MacBook 🤔 #AppleEvent
This is the keyboard I wish we could get on the Pro. TouchID without TouchBar! #AppleEvent

@rynfrz Again, yes the O line is awful. But at least half of those sacks he could have easily avoided. He wilts like a flower so quickly for no reason! Can’t seem to throw it away. Etc. Just so many intangible things he does poorly, numbers aside.
@rynfrz This is a case where the numbers deceive. Did you watch that game yesterday? He’s hands-down the reason they lost. Had two other easy picks dropped. Beckham made two of the most insane catches you’ll ever see. And Barkley is a beast despite no line. The weakness so behind clear.
https://t.co/lVO2dYJWob
@rsobers Which means Barkley is the best RB of all time?
I realize we live in the Bay Area, but you really don’t have to show the 49ers/Cardinals game, Fox. No one needs to see this.
@ryanspoon Two wrongs...
@ryanspoon Yeah I mean I’m more shocked that Jameis Winston is, just given his off the field nonsense. But sure looks like he won’t be after today. Then all that spotlight is back on Eli... I’d be shocked if he lasts another week as starter.
It’s unbelievable just how bad Eli Manning now is. But even more unbelievable how bad he would be without Beckham and Barkley.

Not to be a sore winner... atually, be to a sore winner — Michigan State looked awful. Badly overmatched. Michigan dominated that game on the road. The only reason it wasn’t 40-0 was Michigan’s own mistakes with a hat tip to the weather. #GoBlue 〽️🏈💪
@danbixby Exactly. 💪
@matthewjtucker Some mixture of McElwain, Hamilton, and... Harbaugh?
Do not run a fucking running play there, Michigan. Obviously. Obviously. Obviously. Can they fire the OC mid-game? #GoBlue 〽️🏈
The silver-lining of that fumble/TD was that it hopefully wakes Michigan up. They’ve dominated this game, but purely awful, awful play calling has them with 7 points instead of 20+. Lots of time. #GoBlue 〽️🏈

Shea Patterson is great. I have nothing bad to say about Shea Patterson. He’s just a really good QB. Michigan’s play calling still sucks at times, but he’s solid. I can’t recall the last time I could say this with a Michigan QB. #GoBlue 〽️🏈

@JoshConstine Oh yeah, I wasn’t talking about him in this case. Just others we’ve seen such a pledge from. That always goes away eventually. Because deals are literally made to be broken. Otherwise they wouldn’t even need to be stated. It’s both cynical and true! Such is big company life.

(Not to mention potential payback for the utter disgrace of what McConnell did to Merrick Garland. Who should be on the bench right now. This remains the most insanely disgraceful political maneuver of our era. Which is saying a ton given the current President.)
This is insane. The Republicans are going to try to rush through someone who clearly should not be appointed let alone rushed through. Because they know if they don’t, they’re screwed before the election. Great litmus test for scumbags!
@JackJNYC 💯 the weird thing is that unlike with the Plus, Apple didn’t seem to push devs to tweak this time? I mean you can do a lot with that space! I’d much rather slightly more content than slightly bigger content!
@JackJNYC Yeah good point on pockets. And yes, the “downgrade” is always more jarring. What is this mini phone?! But now I feel like I may like X size better. Need to give it more time, of course.
@andrewnhong It’s nice. But not a game-changer. I need to read on it more to see if it really matters at least in that regard.
My few days old, lukewarm take: the iPhone XS Max doesn’t *feel* that much different than the X, size-wise. I can’t tell if this is because I previously used a ‘Plus’ device for two years before “downsizing” to the X. But I just recall the Plus (from regular) being a bigger jump.
@gruber Ouch. That’s execution almost as poor as the Cowboys today.
@erickbarto @UPS 100% disagree. Price isn’t the issue, it’s doing your stated service. Should you get better service if your item cost more?! Of course not. And I’m actually far more annoyed about a package that went missing (per original tweet) which was a personal item that cost nothing.
@erickbarto By the desire to get what you paid for?
0-3 Old Dominion, a 4 TD underdog versus 2-0 13th ranked Virginia Tech is... crushing them. Wow.

@kessler Yeah never doing this again. Will happily wait in line for an hour versus at home literally *all day* for naught.
Perhaps they mean “by End of Days” as in, the apocalypse. My Apple Watch will be here before the world ends. This also makes their odd capitalization usage make at least some sense...
7 minutes to “end of day” in my book. But genuinely curious what @UPS considers it to be... (this has been the status since 9am this morning) https://t.co/9y2zQGCQ0b
I usually pre-order and head to an Apple Store and everyone says “just get it delivered, super quick and seamless.” Nothing about it was quick nor seamless. At best, UPS takes forever. At worst, thing are lost. Their tracking software sucks. Their customer support is worse.
Rooting for Amazon to crush UPS at this point. Two lost packages in the past month. Then today, an iPhone that shows up at 6pm and an Apple Watch that is... still out for delivery, according to their site. I would love for UPS person to ring doorbell at 2am...

@kennethn Like the sentence you originally shared makes absolutely no sense. “From the standpoint of water”?!We’re looking at the hurricane from water’s vantage point? Is this a surrealist poem or a statement to the American people from a sitting president?
@kennethn It’s like now I’m getting angry because someone should be forced to edit that buffoonery to try to make it at least somewhat respectful.
@kennethn It’s obviously a sad, very real situation. But I’m watching this video and am certain this is satire. There are like a half dozen things in there that no actual human being would ever say. Let alone in public. Let alone the president.

It won’t matter, of course. But it’s just so ridiculously gauche and incredibly inelegant, especially for a premium product. This thing is going to cost $1,200. Max, indeed.
There are many, many jokes. Including this one. But if we really get an ‘iPhone Xs Max’, I think we’re no longer allowed to make fun of Microsoft for naming schemes...

@jyarow I really like the new Nintendo controller...
@gruber I’m totally putting off purchasing my fifth pair until then. The other four will have to suffice for now.
@zackkatz I’m slowly but surely catching up :)
@steven_odb @jpohhhh @gruber Lol. Does anyone besides The Verge complain or even talk about this at all anymore? The headphone situation is SO much better with AirPods versus the wired EarPods. I would never want to go back.
@angelday Yep un-RT’d when I saw that...
@chudson Unclear. But I think it was fine (fumble aside) just time management was so poor...
I mean, nice. But Michigan should have done that taking at least 2-3 less minutes off the clock... #GoBlue 〽️

@Lessien It’s like we all keep thinking, okay *now* they have enough. And they keep building the case. Methodically. It’s insanely impressive.
@panzer @stevesi @pandemona @naval Yep, to pile on: that’s a different feature/content type. Would also help not clog up timeline that way...
@pandemona I’m guessing it might help with the notion of feeling”live” (and maybe cut down on some vitriol), but it also adds a weird pressure...
@pandemona (i.e. rather than the bar thing, which I still think is conceptually weird, what if they’re just indented subservient tweets? Maybe you show in feed just like that too — if you follow someone responding show a silver of their response below main tweet.)
@pandemona Conceptually interesting, don’t love the UI (flat tops?). I wouldn’t go down the presence path, but I think I understand the thinking... One thing I think I like: the notion of @ replies always being under main tweet of conversation. Unless it’s a general @ (not a response)...

What is with the EXAGGERATED app closings in recent iOS 12 betas? It’s like yo-yo-ing with app icons.
@stakwild @theloop @jdalrymple True. Though I imagine a lot of consumers would hear 6.6” iPhone versus 7.9” iPad and think the latter is completely superfluous in their lives (as that probably happened with the first iPhone Pluses...). But I hear you, and that’s precisely why I don’t want it going away!
@davemark That’s why I called it an “iPhone Pro” versus “iPhone X” — that name wasn’t known yet :)

@jakek Thank you for appreciating my complete and utter lack of topical focus. 🙏

@bham44 @reneritchie Okay, but I’m telling you I didn’t. Or if there was such a slight bump that I didn’t even notice, it shouldn’t cause the screen to pop out like that. I’m guessing that happened *after* the screen was off and twisting in the wind for god knows how long...
@reneritchie Thx. As noted, I hate to be “that guy” but it just seems like something is amiss here. And the Twitter responses (and subsequent responses) make it clear these aren’t just isolated incidences...
@TomWinzig @tapbot_paul Yeah seems like it could have happened after. Like when it was dangling like a Slinky for god knows how long...
@spencerhadley Nah. I’ve been in this game too long and have seen too many of those...
@kayvz And I know you know this, but it’s sort of insane watching Twitter make the same mistakes over and over again, just with new people in place. We’ve literally seen this same thing play out 3 or 4 times now over the past 10 years. Kill APIs, reverse course, then kill again...
@kayvz Not to be a (total) dick, but it would seem to me that actually making important policy calls to ban (or not ban, for that matter) accounts like Alex Jones would likely help with focus far more than killing off some APIs...

@downloadcue @CaseyNewton I miss it every day. New Tweetbot is good (though about to be neutered) but OG Twitter for Mac (Tweetie) was the best Twitter experience (with real time streams). That Twitter doesn’t understand this (no matter how many users) is baffling. It was the best product!
@JasonHirschhorn Exactly. The Republicans are upset about the image of the White House on fire ...when they’re the ones that set the White House on fire...

@steverequiem @AppleSupport I know! And I already talked to them after first tweet. They sent me to Apple Store which gave me the swollen battery diagnosis (but had to send in to fix). I do wonder how many folks this has happened to...
@tapbot_paul https://t.co/inlTAZNF6g
@darth WatchGate is on!
I should note, they sent me the “forensic evidence” of an impact that caused the break. The only problem such an impact did not happen. I would absolutely own up to it if it did. It did not. I wear this thing like 90% of the time (except when charging). It did this spontaneously.
@jgobble I’m mostly having fun but there is a zero percent chance I pay to fix this device I didn’t break. And I do wonder how many other people they’re charging for this...
@jgobble https://t.co/txNsB1z0tv
@chriswb That’s what they said in store when I dropped it off. In the lab they disagreed.
@kessler That’s what they told me in the store. Then they sent it in and said that I did something to pop the screen out (I did not).
@alexrkonrad @stevesi The hardware store for ANTS!
Update: Apple is now saying this was in some way my fault. Like perhaps I took a little drill and drilled out the screen on my Apple Watch so it would spontaneously pop out?   And would like me to pay nearly full price to fix. WTF.
@louisgray @CaseyNewton This is 100% accurate.
@CaseyNewton Looks decent. Unfortunately I have 7 different accounts forwarding to 5 different numbers on 3 different phones at this point. So it’s unusable.
In the end, Saudi angle was always the Occam’s razor one.  But the better plays still would have been either to say that he misspoke and meant to say “funding NOT secured”, to make fun of Trump. Or that he omitted a “?”, to make fun of the inability to edit tweets.

Is anyone else having issues with clicking on links in tweets when the tweets are selected? They seem to work in stream but drilling into a tweet makes them unclickable. Been like this for days. Could be an iOS 12 thing but I don’t think so...

@kayvz @CaseyNewton Interesting question. I’d probably be okay with it just being tweets (versus replies). But then what about the replies to my tweets that archive?   Does the visibility of the whole chain go as the parent goes (archived versus not)?
@CaseyNewton @kayvz Yeah I generally prefer archive versus delete. But that just means I’m old.   But in all seriousness, I do think an auto-archive option is compelling.
@CaseyNewton @kayvz What about an option to auto-archive? (This was you could retweet/respawn your old tweets to prove you were right about something. And do nothing when you were wrong about something.)

@GordonMckenzie Shaq. But really, if the sides are just for that, they don’t need to be that size/shaped that way. Again, on MacBook they’re situated perfectly for charging. So either that was a coincidence or Apple made an inadvertent mistake releasing that one first!
@DangThatJoe Maybe. But then they made a mistake in starting with the MacBook one where not only can you charge it in the sleeve, many people (myself included), do. And it sure seems like the cut outs are perfectly situation for that purpose!
@DangThatJoe https://t.co/c1mueuNLx6
@GordonMckenzie I have the MacBook one. I never take it out by the sides. And those are perfectly cut to make room for... charging...
I’m guessing Apple doesn’t want you charging it in the sleeve (it gets hot in there) but then why have those cut outs which seem to indicate they’re to expose the ports for charging (as they do on the MacBook case)?

@micahjarrett I bet it drives Apple even more crazy!
@jeffbarnosky Yeah the need to often “hack” sites to load the “real” web is very, very annoying...
@navkumar_ @reneritchie Yeah, exactly. It’s bigger than the pop-ups, they’re just the most in-your-face and obvious example. All sorts of JS actions are borked with touch, sadly. I have to assume Apple assumed they’d bend towards their will. Been years now...
@reneritchie And yeah, Medium has an app that let’s you do most of it. But not quite all of it (for various good reasons, I might add — there are trade offs). It’s why I write on iPad but still edit and publish on a Mac...
@reneritchie Medium &amp; Review to name two. A lot of content-based sites, sadly. Basically anything that has a pop-up overlay...
@beeso I have one. For that reason! But it’s not like people who grew up on touch can do all this stuff. They just probably don’t quite know *why* they can’t...
Yeah, it’s not even the tech — the iPad browser is great! — it’s just the interaction model. Apple needs to acknowledge that they need some sort of point-and-click option beyond touch. Trackpad in newfangled iPad keyboard? Hopefully the “Marzipan” stuff is a bridge there... https://t.co/OsRKYk2cxw
@Poughkeepsie125 Any website that has any sort of pop-over (Medium, Revue, etc), for one.
@Jas Heh, yeah, I like that this article acknowledges my correct take there in hindsight :)
Of course, I have this sneaking suspicion Apple is going to remedy some of this later this year. Based on nothing other than a gut feeling. Maybe it’s just pure hope...
(Sent from my iPad Pro, by the way. Which is still my preferred machine for 99% of things. But that one pesky percent...)
I would totally try this. Looks nice and would seem to solve the one last major issue I have with the iPad — you still can’t use the “full” web because a lot of the web is still based around point-and-click, for better or worse. https://t.co/4nn5dVgzYM

@TruckChudmore Just cause of the change from old way? The old way was always weird to me... Especially if you switch between an iPhone X and iPad regularly...
(Yes, rather than update to 11.4.1, I just jumped right to 12 public beta — if I was gonna have to download and restart anyway... Plus, felt very stable and fast on iPhone. Same on iPad.)
New iPad gestures for iOS 12 make a lot more sense than they used to, though obviously a learning curve for those of us who spent years with the old way.   Still humorous for Apple to so obviously indicate what’s coming in future hardware (iPad without home button) this way.

@brianmcc The problem, of course, is that none of those business can leverage the economies of scale. So they have to be okay with just being “nice businesses” — not, well, Amazon.
@brianmcc Yeah the key to all of this, is the more boutique and targeted, the better. Like the independent bookstore resurgence. Big brands are screwed. For now, at least.

@kdzeja Which is a clever thing to say but isn’t actually true. Lack of inaction on certain things proves nothing. He is a stupid person. Plenty of stupid people decide to do nothing!
@billychasen Oh for sure. I just hope Twitter is around then 😉
Which is all just a long-winded way of saying that this is how and why Trump has enablers. https://t.co/6N1tjjSfYq
It’s the deference to him because they don’t want to — or can’t — believe this person can be *that* stupid. So they constantly back down to let someone else be the one to be made to look foolish. Not realizing that time will make them all look foolish...
The worst part about Trump being as stupid as he clearly is, is how many people assume he can’t be this dumb. That he must be playing 6-dimensional chess. Otherwise, how could he get to where he is? When the answer is contained in this tweet.  It’s... those... people...

...and we now cut live to San Antonio where Kawhi Leonard has agreed to pay the salary of LeBron James next year in order to join the Lakers. He’ll be paid negative $35M on the year...
@kennethn I would honestly do even less than that. And yes! Some fun tournament at beginning, middle and end for seeding and bragging rights.
@ltm True. Those are the pre-season warm up games. 😂
Maybe this is the NBA’s clever way to shorten the schedule. In fact, let’s cancel all 82 games and cut right to the second round of the playoffs...
As the NBA has just started to talk up expansion again, I think they just contracted into 4 or 5 teams.   This is nuts. 🏀🏀🏀
Warriors vs. Lakers is now almost literally West All-Stars vs. East All Stars...
Have the Lakers signed Michael Jordan yet? Have the Warriors signed Larry Bird?

@stevesi I know, but I had much higher hopes since they did so well doing the end-run-around SMS with iMessage in the first place... That was a masterstroke in both idea and execution...
@rajatsuri Sounds like ads coming soon though ;)
I gave up using FB Messenger because they kept shoving non core messaging things in your face. First ‘Stories’, but ads were the last straw. But there’s no question that their UI/UX for most of this is 100x superior.
@holgr Exactly. What a nightmare.
Continue to be amazed by just how poorly thought out and implemented the “app” potion of iMessage is. I thought iOS 12 might alleviate some of it. I think it’s actually a little worse now.
Looks like we won’t get a ‘Warriors v. Cavs V’ — no real surprise after ‘IV’ disappointed at the box office.   Rumor is they’re trying to reboot ‘Lakers v. Celtics’ tho....
Thank you @KingJames for:  1) Bringing a championship to Cleveland.   2) Making this a quick decision and not an excruciating ‘Decision’.   Good luck in LA, will be fun to watch. 👑👑👑🏀🏀🏀
He’s going to the Lakers. https://t.co/TjqpsSKmie
@jeremyderrick True. But in the East.
Anyway, it’s gonna be nuts. Even with that “Big 3” the road still goes through the Warriors. The question is: is that Lakers team better than the Rockets? I think so, but the Rockets took the Warriors to 7!
@sbatwater No doubt.
So next year would like the pre-season, or auditions for the LeBron Lake Show. See who of the young guys can cut it. Of course, he’s not getting any younger himself...
But maybe that’s the key to the 4 year deal... Cede next year to Warriors. They probably have to part ways with one of core after that. Maybe even two. Sign Kawhi then...
Without that, there’s basically no realistic shot of taking down the Warriors next year. Even *with* all 3 of those, it’s probably a long shot... Which is nuts. 🏀🏀🏀
Now safe to assume Lakers will get either Kawhi or Boogie. But is there any chance (obviously with trades) that they can get *both*?
@davidjoelhall No doubt. We’ll see who else the Lakers bring in. At least one more top 10 guy. Maybe two... And it *still* probably won’t be enough.

I’m being nice. That is an awful movie. One of the worst I’ve seen in theaters in some time. But a pretty great encapsulation of what is wrong with Hollywood these days.

@dominocollege That’s a pretty bold statement. So here’s a bold retort: there is no chance Apple makes this move if it’s just “tech community” and “tech Twitter” with major issues here.
@mutle @CodyBrown I’m actually with you — I *like* typing on the new one, but the issue is the inexcusably high break rate, which sort of negates the joys of typing. I was hopeful a second iteration would fix such issues, but clearly it did not. Just seems flawed...

@mutle @CodyBrown I think he meant the “old” one 😉
@mutle Famous last words. I was in that camp for 18 months or so. Then BOOM.
But hey, at least we got the TouchBar out of this. https://t.co/iBQMzs8qYO
@evan Yeah, it will be nuts if they revert — because as you note, the entire machine is built around that slimness of the keyboard/form factor. So do they revert to the old (bulkier) shells too? But that seems faster than re-thinking the entire thing?
Given the keyboard has already gone through at least a couple iterations, this seems to be more of a fundamental flaw versus an easy fix. Might require rethinking the entire mechanism. Or reverting to the old one?
I wonder what they’re going to do with the next iteration of the MacBooks and Pros. Do they already have some fix in place for 2018 models? Are there going to be no 2018 models as a direct result of this?
Apple of course says this is about a “small percentage” of machines, but that always means nothing. They can slice the data as they want. Anecdotally, nearly everyone I know who has had one of these devices for long enough has had this issue. I’ve had it on two different machines
What a disaster for Apple. More a PR one than a monetary one, of course. But as we’re seeing, that PR one can have real monetary effects if people hear about this and decide not to buy a new MacBook as a result... https://t.co/suZLdMsJLA

Only if you’re starting from scratch though (weren’t logged in to Twitter before). The log in screen is just borked. And again, has been for two weeks. I think the workaround is to reinstall iOS 11, log in to Twitter, then reinstall iOS 12. 😂🤣
@mattpuczko Yeah, only if you need to log in though, not if you upgraded a device already logged in.
Pretty sure no one has been able to log in to Twitter from iOS 12 since it rolled out a couple weeks ago. I know it’s the dev build, but still. Probably a high overlap between Twitter users and iOS beta users...

@BryFitz A very good point/idea...
I also just think the ambient ads — around the field and on the jerseys — is better for brand recognition anyway. You *have* to see them. And they might be tied to a moment you’ll remember.
The (slight) downside is that it sometimes takes a long time to show a replay.   I’ll take that 100% of the time.

@tomwarren I don’t get it. There seems to be no one who thinks it looks good. And it’s getting worse with age. What were they thinking? Function over form? Cleverness over beauty? Did they just skip the mock up portion?
To add to it: by far the best of this cluster, The Gherkin, is now almost completely hidden.   On the plus side, at least the BT Tower isn’t a part of this group as one final middle finger (or lightsaber) to the sky...

@reneritchie ‘Apple News’ on Apple TV could be pretty compelling as a newfangled news show with video curation from several publishers... totally different product than iPhone/iPad version, but branding would work just as well...
@reneritchie Speaking of, does anyone use Apple Maps on the Mac? I’m genuinely curious...
@reneritchie Yeah good point on strategic value. Makes more sense on Apple TV to me (for video, obviously) for sure. The desktop web usually covers the other stuff well in a way the mobile web doesn’t (when speed/page load times, etc matters more).
Also, Apple News on Mac may be the best *finally* joke yet. I can think of at least four dozen other things that probably should have gotten priority over that...

@john_chou Ha. Fair. But even I had the score *right in front of me* and I’m watching him and thinking: is the score on the screen wrong?
@john_chou Right, but I could see someone fouling in the chaos not realizing what he was doing...
I’m still too mad about the first (no way do you overturn that charge call) and dumbfounded by the second (I’m almost more shocked the Warriors didn’t do something silly to stop clock not realizing that Smith really just didn’t know what he was doing) to come up with good names.
Cleveland was so overdue for their next ‘The’ moment (‘The Drive’, ‘The Shot’, ‘The Fumble’, etc) that they managed to get two in the span of a few minutes of the same game. ‘The Overturn’ and ‘The No Shot’...
What an overall unfortunate end to an otherwise great game. Never seen a team lose like that. #NBAfinals
That’s not quite a Chris Webber mistake. But it’s almost as bad. Wow.
@sriramk It was pretty close but it’s insane that they overturned it. Just like football they should side with call on field unless it’s obviously the other way.

@catinthefurnace Yes Boston shooting has kept it close. But Cavs have missed at least 5 wide open 3 off LeBron assists already,..
@harryh Every single NBA game isn’t a Game 7 on the road. Swung it from a tied game to a 4 point deficit at halftime. You cannot miss that call.
@harryh And I mean, in no way was he set. In a game like this, it was an awful, awful mouthful of bullshit. Cavs can’t win this game (shooting as they are) avoiding that nonsense, if that’s what the refs are gonna call...
@harryh It was this, but far less close. https://t.co/rMFtOHntGj
Well that will go down as the ultimate flop of all time...
@schlaf Yeah yeah. The thing is, I’m not sure they are. We’ll see next year but I wouldn’t be shocked if there “better” like this without one of those guys. Probably Kyrie...
@ryanspoon @ThufirHawat Yeah...
This is like watching the end of ‘300’. But I keep hoping it’s more like the ‘Battle of the Bastards’...
@catinthefurnace Well, yes.
@ryanspoon Yeah sadly, Korver is really off so far. Unclear if Smith even traveled to Boston...
In all seriousness, Cavs are really, really missing Kevin Love right now. They’re going to have to shoot an insanely high percentage from here out to have a shot...
The Cavs main problem, thus far, is that they’re forced to play other players who are not LeBron James.

My only tweak to his thoughts is that I think the “power users” should get another product too. TweetDeck-ish but more like how Twitter for Mac (Tweetie) was originally. All dead now.
But the correct business model (or tech) isn’t in place for that. Which is why the third-party apps keep getting killed over and over again. Sadly.
I almost 100% agree with his thoughts on Twitter. To cross the chasm there needs to be other, tangential products built on top of it. Unfortunately, that would have been *a lot* easier to do years ago, through third-party apps. But could still do it now!

@delbius Thanks. FWIW this is at least a couple weeks old. I noticed it, assumed it was a bug. Then turned the filter back on a few days later. The filtering has gotten even worse.
Maybe, just maybe, deactivate the pushes *before* deactivating being able to see the tweets in stream. Otherwise your users are going to think they’re going insane. More so than they already do, I mean. 🤦‍♂️
The reason I even realized this is because Twitter still sends *push notifications* for these tweets. Then we you go to your replies area, they’re not there. I mean if they really believe I shouldn’t see that stuff, why *push* them at me?! Oh, Twitter. 🤦‍♂️
@Medvidekpu Yeah I’ve had it on for a while. The weird thing is that I get push notifications for people replying (verified) and then can’t see them. Because Twitter has hiding them in the reply stream. I should be surprised by this. But I’m not.
@macinjay Oh yeah this was filtered. It just came up in my “people who are wrong” list 😜
