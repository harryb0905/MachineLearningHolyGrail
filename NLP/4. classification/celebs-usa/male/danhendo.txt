Here's a quick recap of last weekend's fight night in case you missed it it. https://t.co/4OxVJhPSY9
Injuries are tough to come back from, but I‚Äôm sure we will see her in the Octagon soon. https://t.co/zD6O1YDbti
This is a lot of weight to cut in a week. Especially for someone that doesn't know how to cut weight. https://t.co/1iUyGQJOFv
The UFC pays their stars so I'm sure they will work it out. https://t.co/LPrijHvQIb
Everyone wants to be on the MSG card but I think Cowboy would be a good pick. https://t.co/KcolHPzlHf
Looking forward to UFC 203. Let me hear your picks. https://t.co/SOwMWZoboF
I have to agree with Ronda. MMA is a great outlet to take out some built up aggression. Everyone should try it! https://t.co/RG8QnUuTbU
I‚Äôm pretty sure I could take Captain America, with or without the shield. https://t.co/OodE3j2ZMN
A fighter should always be able to have his corner with him on fight days. https://t.co/MWpHqbziiQ
Do you want to see Tito v Fedor? And why is Tito so worried about the weight? I fought him at HW. https://t.co/NVCQCkr7i4
I didn‚Äôt think he would be back so quickly after that injury. https://t.co/m6ItiHnwaD
This weekend is full of great fights, but I decided to take a look at how I see the main event going down. https://t.co/10YoZu6LD0
Though I also don‚Äôt know what to make of CM Punk, I‚Äôm with Alistair in wishing him luck in his fight. https://t.co/l6nrl5A3zQ
You guys may have liked 202 but UFC 204 is going to be even better. https://t.co/VAQCyKCeu8

#Bellator134 but Kongo hits hard and Mo doesn't have the best chin.  So flip a coin.
Tough call.  Mo will prob just hump him for 3 rounds. And Mo will get the takedown.  RT @Steel3553: Hendo, Kongo or Mo? @danhendo
