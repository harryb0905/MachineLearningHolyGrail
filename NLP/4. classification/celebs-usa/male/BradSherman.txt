It was great to meet with the Director of Advocacy for @jworldwatch, Ms. Ann Strimov Durbin. This is a great organization that assists survivors of mass atrocities around the globe and seeks to inspire people of all faiths and cultures to join the fight against genocide. https://t.co/94fhb0UHwO
I was pleased to meet with Mr. Kentaro Sonoura, Member of the Japanese Parliament. We discussed burden sharing, trade deficit, and U.S.-Japanese relations. https://t.co/OevXhFEU86
The hearing will preview the upcoming #TrumpKimSummit. I look forward to hearing from Governor Richardson and other witnesses on how we can begin to see tangible progress in our negotiations with North Korea. For more details, click here: https://t.co/lDKtEYA0ZE
Pleased to announce that @GovRichardson, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Governor of New Mexico, will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia tomorrow, February 26th, at 10:15 AM EST.
The Art of the #Capitulation   https://t.co/85B10iU8N9
I will be appearing on @OutFrontCNN on @CNN at 4:30 PM PST (7:30 EST) to discuss the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. #TrumpKimSummit
(3) MBS has stated point blank that he wants the option to develop a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow this to happen, and only the highest Congressional scrutiny will ensure that. I commend @RepCummings and the Oversight and Reform Committee for bringing attention to this issue.
(2) That needs to change. Next week, I will be reintroducing legislation [https://t.co/PuH8bLmpih] with @marcorubio and @SenMarkey to require a vote in both houses to approve any nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia.
(1) New report sheds disturbing light on US efforts to push Saudi nuclear program. https://t.co/A922niKBZa. Right now, a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia could go into force without Congressional approval.
We do have a national emergency: It's Donald Trump. #FakeTrumpEmergency
The murder of Sindhi activist Irshad Ranjhani in Karachi is heartbreaking and unacceptable. Arresting Rahim Shah is a good start, but I call on Pakistan to conduct a full and fair investigation so Ranjhani’s family receives the justice they deserve.
Hey @JeffBezos, @amazon ’s still welcome in LA   https://t.co/Xyo1oPemKw
Glad to meet with M.R. Rangaswami and Sanjeev Joshipura of @IndiasporaForum, today. I learned that the Indian-American community has provided $1.2 billion to American institutions of higher learning over the past 18 years (only counting the largest contributions). https://t.co/rRe1X5GxSt
Pleased to join so many of my Democratic colleagues to co-sponsor the #GreenNewDeal. Global climate change is real, and it's time to address the issue in a serious way.
(3) We advanced this bill through the Judiciary Committee last night and will fight to bring this bill to the Floor in honor of the victims and families of #Parkland and every community devastated by gun violence.
(2) I was proud to co-sponsor the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019: bipartisan, commonsense legislation that represents the will of the American people.
(1) One year ago today, 14 children died in the #Parkland shooting. Since then, nearly 1,200 more children have lost their lives due to guns. We must follow the example set by the students of Parkland and turn our grief into action until all our children and communities are safe.
The group claiming responsibility for this attack, JeM, is based in Pakistan. Islamabad must do more to reign in terrorists groups that it harbors and (in some cases) supports.
My thoughts are with the victims of today’s terrorist attack in Jammu &amp; Kashmir. I strongly condemn this egregious act of terrorism. The US stands by India in confronting and defeating terrorism. #KashmirTerrorAttack #PulwamaAttack
I was honored to join the Michigan delegation in remembering my old friend John Dingell on the House floor tonight. https://t.co/FtJHnp4fs5
It was a pleasure to welcome Ambassador Santiago Cabanas Ansorena of Spain to Washington D.C. today to discuss the importance of U.S.-Spanish relations. https://t.co/cj0r287liD
All Democrats voted for Motion to Recommit. Two Republicans voted “present.” 100 percent of anti-Israel votes cast by Republicans.
It was a pleasure meeting with Speaker Moon Hee-Sang and other members of the South Korean National Assembly. We discussed holding reunions between Americans and their family members in North Korea and the second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. https://t.co/kz7vPQcoam
Last week, @seanhannity invited me on his show for tonight. We confirmed the appearance in writing. They had to cancel. Hope we can reschedule.
We lost another great congressman in Walter Jones. We remember the respect he showed his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, his efforts on behalf of veterans and military families, and the spirit of bipartisanship he embodied in his service to his constituents and country.
What Rep. Omar said was wrong. So is the cynical attempt by those claiming to be pro-Israel to say Rep. Omar speaks for the Democratic Party.
Israel’s worst enemies and its so-called “best friends” (like the Republican Jewish Coalition) are both trying to say “you can’t be a progressive Democrat and be pro-Israel.”
...Congress and the American people are pro-Israel because Israel deserves our support. I've been pro-Israel my entire life. I gave money to @AIPAC before I ran for office. They do great work and I look forward to speaking at their annual conference next month, for the 23rd time
I agree with Chairman @RepEliotEngel that “Anti-Semitism in any form is unacceptable, and it’s shocking to hear a Member of Congress invoke the anti-Semitic trope of ‘Jewish Money’”. Rep. Omar claims that Congress is pro-Israel because of AIPAC and contributions...
We lost a great and honorable man, former Representative John David Dingell Jr., who served in Congress for nearly six decades. John served this country with honor in wartime and with distinction as a legislator. May John's legacy guide us forward and serve as an inspiration.
In this era of the 10-minute news cycle, good politics "requires" immediate decisions. But good legislating has always required study and hard work --- and that can take a few days.
The #GreenNewDeal (H. Res. 109) may be the most wide-ranging and consequential measure put before the Congress in recent years. I look forward to analyzing it this weekend.
I met with Dr. Al-Issa, who heads the Muslim World League. I urged him to use his influence in the Muslim World to at least eliminate capital punishment for adultery, blasphemy, apostasy, or being in the LGBT community. The response was not as encouraging as you would like. https://t.co/SC9X2OPbCk

(Still waiting on @TuckerCarlson who promised to discuss Trump’s tax bill as soon as it was proposed)
I’ll be on @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews a bit after 9 pm PST to share my thoughts on the #StateOfTheUnion. I believe it is important for Democrats to appear on Fox, even though they rarely invite me and often cancel.
First #SOTU in history when a President began by demanding that Congress not investigate him.
.@WorldBank has lent $7.8 billion to China since 2016. If @realDonaldTrump wants to save money, he can end this practice. At a hearing in December, I questioned David Malpass, Trump’s nominee for World Bank President, who made good points. https://t.co/jeG8ERnCgb
I was proud to join my colleagues on a letter sent to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan demanding he stop the implementation of #Trump’s ban on transgender patriots who wish to serve our country through military service. We must #ProtectTransTroops.
This month, we celebrate the contributions made by African-Americans that shape the beliefs and values of all people. #BlackHistoryMonth
My Rabbi was right. There wouldn’t be a Shofar without the Rams. Go L.A. #SuperBowl @RamsNFL
Appears the #President is misinformed when he claims on @FaceTheNation that we have 40,000 troops in South Korea. It's under 30,000.
My letter, found here https://t.co/BcwVTE0XFO, lays out all the reasons. This is actually a win for the Russians, and we take the blame for killing yet another agreement.
#Trump’s decision to pull out of the INF now is another ill-advised decision by his administration. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee with jurisdiction over nonproliferation, I oppose this move and urged the administration not to take it.
I'm pleased to announce that a 15 day extension to register for assistance from @fema has been granted for those affected by the #WoolseyFire. Please follow this link for more information:   https://t.co/Bx65OKiQed
.@RepGwenMoore exemplified bravery and grace. Her story is just one example of why we must not relent in our fight to ensure that all Americans have coverage for preexisting conditions and have access to affordable and quality healthcare. https://t.co/nyOn78W2YR
I also spoke at length with @HEBobiWine about the importance of democracy, respect for human rights and ensuring stability, not just in Uganda, but in the region as a whole. #PeoplePower https://t.co/yCr9pnhJBU
It was a pleasure to greet my friend @HEBobiWine and discuss pressing issues facing #Uganda and the greater region. We exchanged our concerns over Uganda’s role in military transfers to South Sudan and Uganda’s possible involvement in the DRC.

It was a pleasure to meet with @SEC_News Chairman Clayton today. We discussed protecting investors. I laid out the many reasons, both legal and policy, why the SEC should not change its policy on shareholder class action lawsuits. https://t.co/YpUIi4j3MP
I strongly support the state of New York's efforts to call upon corporations to ensure their workforce is inclusive of people with disabilities. I met today with @CalPERS and discussed the importance of disability inclusion in their investments. https://t.co/RzAJX9Aat3
It was a pleasure to meet with the @VEDC_business to discuss strategies for providing support to small businesses in the Valley. https://t.co/dauBYZ2P7m
These incidents constitute a violation of the federal hate-crime statues and I will urge the @FBI to investigate and for federal prosecutors to prosecute to the full extent of the law.
I strongly condemn this hateful act of vandalism. It is particularly cruel to those whose family members died in the Armenian Genocide.
I have been informed that Turkish flags have been posted outside and inside of the Holy Martyrs Ferrahian High School, and other Armenian schools and churches in Southern California.
I hope to welcome Ambassador @HarshShringla to the Valley soon.
As the incoming co-chair of the India Caucus, it was great to meet with the new Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Mr. @HarshShringla. I’ve had the opportunity to meet with every Indian Ambassador during this century and have hosted 3 of the Ambassadors in the San Fernando Valley. https://t.co/MqeUf4GJIy
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we honor and remember the 6 million Jews who were murdered and commit ourselves to continuing the fight against bigotry, anti-semitism, and intolerance. #WeRemember
#Trump allows the government to open for 3 weeks. Let’s keep it open. And let’s pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform: border security and permanent relief for #Dreamers and millions of long-term U.S. residents who have not committed violent crimes.
It will be similar to the bill I introduced last Congress with @SenMarkey and @marcorubio.   https://t.co/ITjXUEfD4U
That is why I will soon be introducing legislation to ensure Congress votes on any nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia. The bill will deter Saudi Arabia from developing a nuclear weapon.
Saudi Arabia appears to have secretly built a ballistic missile production facility. This once again underscores the need to get strident restrictions on its proposed nuclear program.   https://t.co/PkCyr8IPAx
.@TSA announced that they have found funding to provide employees with transit and parking benefits. @TSA employees deserve to be compensated with more than a consolation prize. Trump must stop jeopardizing our national security by holding federal wages hostage. #EndtheShutdown
The only one of the two bills that will reach Trump’s desk is the one to open government till February 8.  Will he dare veto it after it garners support of Senate Republicans? Not sure Mitch is making White House happy. Not sure he cares. https://t.co/wRVOac3H9D
Good news! And a nod to mediator @MayorOfLA Eric Garcetti. https://t.co/c4flKjTe7A
As a senior member of @FSCDems, I will be introducing legislation to prevent credit rating agencies from lowering the credit scores of federal employees and contractors if they can’t make payments during a government #shutdown and 60 days after the shutdown ends.
In Singapore, Trump capitulated to Kim Jong Un – handing North Korea a propaganda coup in exchange for empty words. During a second summit, he must deliver concrete, verifiable commitments from Pyongyang. https://t.co/8xFHLF2Lsv
While we don't know what evidence supports Buzzfeed's charges, we do have sworn testimony from a highly credible witness on the record of impeachable offenses committed in the first 5 months that #trump was in office.  See my analysis below. https://t.co/x9ud1LcxtT
If the reports in @BuzzFeed are true @realDonaldTrump should resign or be impeached.
#Trump prepares to cave. https://t.co/ZHV0KmTrnC
The Administration has claimed that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census is part of Trump’s Latino Empowerment Program. The only people who believe that are those who also believe that #Trump has been faithful to all three of his wives.https://t.co/xvL7agb9xl

Malicious and illegal efforts to punish fire victims simply because @realDonaldTrump can't win elections in California. https://t.co/egUDFiP9h6
Losing hope that we will get comprehensive immigration reform.  A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.
Soon, Trump will claim authority under the NEA to divert money from military housing to his Wall. Court fight to follow. If Trump wins, military housing is defunded.
#TrumpSpeech won't cause Congress to fund the Wall. His real reason for the speech and his upcoming border visit is to claim there's a crisis which he will use to invoke the National Emergencies Act.
Met with Erik Mandt and Martin Ramirez of the @NATCA. Discussed the effects of the #shutdown, working without pay, the need for more air traffic controllers, and airport noise and flight patterns over southern San Fernando Valley. https://t.co/bCOiaxj864

All bills introduced and not passed in 2017 and 2018 expired today at noon.  So filing Articles is necessary to avoid taking a step backward.
I believe that Obstruction of Justice is the clearest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump.  Read my analysis published in the Huffington Post here. https://t.co/x9ud1LcxtT
Today, I reintroduced Articles of #Impeachment against @realDonaldTrump with @RepAlGreen.  I have not changed the text from the Articles I first introduced in July 2017. https://t.co/LUkI6pyWiX

Since 1998, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act has saved 67 million acres of rainforest. Today, the House passed a bill I introduced with @RepSteveChabot &amp; @SenRobPortman to reauthorize this program, which has already passed the Senate. It now awaits the President’s signature.
I introduced the Uighur Intervention and Global Humanitarian Unified Response (UIGHUR) Act with @RepTedYoho. Will be reintroducing this bill next year.  Read my press release here: https://t.co/tXKciCZRu3 #UighurMuslims
As I've said, a government that cannot be trusted with a bone saw, should not be trusted with a nuclear weapon. Thanks to @SenMarkey, @SenRubioPress, and @RepLukeMesser for joining me in introducing my bill, the No Nuclear Weapons for #SaudiArabia Act. https://t.co/eFoeK3IzXZ
Pleased to meet with @EriasLukwago, the Lord Mayor of Kampala. It was a good chance to discuss human rights and democracy in #Uganda https://t.co/g4ynWvnuLj

Earlier this year I met with @HEBobiWine after he was brutally beaten and detained by Ugandan security forces for speaking out against corruption. Today they have reportedly surrounded him and his team. The Ugandan govt must commit to the essential principle of freedom of speech. https://t.co/ddb5WpKbSF

Recently, I joined with @RepSteveChabot and other colleagues in introducing H.Res. 1091 declaring that the Burmese military has violated this Convention. The @IntlCriminalCourt must secure justice for the victims.
U.S. recognition of the #Rohingya genocide is long overdue. Today is the 70th anniversary of the @UN Convention against Genocide.
Pleasure to meet today with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. We discussed defending Ukrainian democracy. That includes its territorial integrity and its elections. https://t.co/v71UEvkbxn
At the same time, Trump has refused to impose sanctions on major Chinese banks that work with North Korea. He cancelled military exercises. We got little or nothing — so far.
Our highest priority must be to get North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile capabilities in return for some U.S. concessions, as part of a phased process of denuclearization, action-for-action.
The result of President Trump’s dithering on North Korea after the Singapore Summit is that Pyongyang is expanding its nuclear and missile capabilities, as revealed by @MIIS https://t.co/GkmKjyhp2X

#TrumpCaves. The object of Trump’s “plan” was to force China to buy more from the USA. Now he claims victory because #China will resume agricultural purchases, perhaps as much as they were buying before #Trump.
Today, the nation is mourning the loss of our beloved President George Herbert Walker Bush. We will forever remember his compassion, sacrifice, commitment and patriotism. The life and legacy of President Bush will forever remain. My prayers are with the Bush family.

I just voted no on the Outrageous Republican Rule. It undercuts the War Powers Act.
This will make California eligible for rebuilding assistance and provide tax relief for victims. #WoolseyFire
Good news: @JerryBrownGov had requested that the fire ravaged areas of California be declared a Federal Disaster Area. I joined with @JuliaBrownley26 and @RepTedLieu in support of that request, which has just been approved by the administration.
He has yet to approve request submitted by @JerryBrownGov, @JuliaBrownley26, @RepTedLieu, and myself for a disaster declaration which would allow individuals and businesses impacted by the #WoolseyFire to apply for federal assistance in rebuilding.
#Trump has approved CA's request for an emergency declaration which helps first respondents save lives and property.
.@JuliaBrownley26 , @TedLieu and I are working together to ensure our community has the resources it needs to fight the #Woolsey fire. We sent a letter to #Trump urging him to approve @JerryBrownGov's request for an expedited major disaster declaration for California. https://t.co/T26bJZeGok

Protecting Robert #Mueller’s ongoing investigation is paramount and we must do everything in our power to stop @realDonaldTrump from stopping him. That’s why I cosponsored the Special Counsel Independence Protection Act last February. #ProtectMueller
Officials have confirmed that the #ThousandOaks shooter used a high-capacity magazine that Californians voted to ban in 2016. The @NRA filed a lawsuit to block the law. It's time for California to uphold the will of the voters, enforce the law, and for the country to follow suit.
This morning we awoke to another mass shooting in America, this time in a neighboring community. My thoughts are with the victims and first responders in #ThousandOaks, including the family of Sgt. Ron Helus who ran towards the danger and died a hero. #BorderLineShooting
This will cause irreparable harm to the University’s reputation. @UCLA should cancel the @NationalSJP conference before more damage is done.

Trump’s tax returns from a few years ago are no longer under audit. Why won’t he release them?
.@realDonaldTrump lies at today’s press conference. As a tax attorney and CPA, I know there is no disadvantage to releasing tax returns under audit.  In an audit, your adversary is the IRS, and they already have the returns. For Trump, the adversary is the American people.
Today I met with officials from the FAA to discuss proposed aviation procedures that will have a direct impact on communities in the San Fernando Valley.

This morning I will join our Jewish community in Valley Village and address Congregation Shaarey Zedek.  I hope that many of you will worship in peace and #ShowUpForShabbat.
We also passed legislation that will require the FAA to consider diverging flight paths and adjusting departure procedures to address community concerns over noise. Although more work needs to be done, I will continue to fight for quieter skies over the San Fernando Valley.
I will also meet with the Acting @FAANews Administrator on Election Day in order to demonstrate the impact these changes have on our community and identify ways to reduce aviation noise.
I have been working to combat the plague of airplane noise in the Valley. On October 18, I addressed the Hollywood Burbank Airport Meeting and expressed my strong opposition to their proposed changes to flight routes that would increase noise over the San Fernando Valley.
SJP has declared its support for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - which glorifies the murder of Jewish civilians, and which the Obama State Department listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
Within a month after the most deadly anti-Semitic murders in America, UCLA will host the national conference of SJP, an anti-Semitic organization. Sadly, UCLA will provide its facilities at the subsidized “student organization” rate.
I send my deepest sympathies to the families of the victims of the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue and the entire community in Pittsburgh. We will stand together against Saturday morning’s violence, anti-Semitism, and hate. https://t.co/VgpvNu2xnh.

3/ The populist reaction would have occurred even if everyone in Congress had fallen into line and voted as Wall Street expected. The populist reaction intensified with the job losses in '09-'11. It would have been even more intense if we had lost the $700 billion.
2/ Instead, we forced them to abandon the plan and buy preferred stock, and we got back virtually all the taxpayers’ money.
1/ Interesting article. For the record, I never said anything about a depression. What I did say is that we would have lost the lion’s share of $700 billion if they had been able to stick with their plan and just buy toxic assets. https://t.co/8gaH4ZutZ4

.@rushlimbaugh is an idiot. In yesterday's radio show, he focused on my appearance on @FoxNews with @HARRISFAULKNER where I called for vote tabulation security.

SCOTUS ignored a simple fact: This is a “Muslim Ban” precisely because @realDonaldTrump called it a #MuslimBan. #NoMuslimBanEver
Today, #SCOTUS set a historic and shameful precedent of sanctioning discrimination. Discrimination based on one’s religion is contrary to our nation’s founding values and the Court’s decision puts the religious liberty of all Americans at risk.

#TheArtoftheCapitulation: Make major concessions.  Accept vague platitudes.  Announce you’ve negotiated the Best Deal Ever.
#TheArtoftheCapitulation. We stop military exercises needed to defend South Korea.  We give green light to China to ease sanctions.

Who worked harder to prepare for the #SingaporeSummit : @realDonaldTrump or @dennisrodman? It worries me that this is even a serious question.

Two points: the U.S. and allies must maintain pressure on the North, and on the other hand must be ready to agree to only interim steps in the near term.  A nuclear-free North Korea will not happen overnight.
The meeting between Kim and President Moon was promising, and we hope for progress towards the goal of denuclearization.

Only two members of the House voted against sanctioning #Iran for human rights violations and taking Americans hostage.  Both members are Republicans.

That said, the Administration should have provided Congress with a classified briefing to show us how strong his proof is that al-Assad was behind the recent chemical attack.
It was good that in 2014 we forced al-Assad to turn over 2.8 million pounds of highly toxic chemical weapons. We need to show that those who violate the Chemical Weapon Conventions will be punished.
This Saturday at 2 PM tune into @gurveysLaw on @KABCRadio where I'll be discussing the latest on China and trade, North Korea, the Census, and the tax law.
Reviving TPP will further increase the trade deficit—look at the trade deal w/ South Korea. None of the countries involved are going to alter their policies toward China, it will not address any of our trade problems with China, and will not change the security situation in Asia.
The Trump Administration is reviving the TPP.  The idea that the TPP is a counter to China is nonsense.  It benefits and was in large part written by, multinational corporations seeking to ease outsourcing.

In 2016, @realDonaldTrump promised to eliminate the debt in eight years. Instead, @USCBO says that laws passed since he took office, including the #GOPTaxScam, will add $2.7 trillion more to deficits over the next ten years. Looks like President Trump really is the #KingofDebt.
@HouseForeign needs a classified briefing on the chemical attack in #Douma. If this crime was indeed committed by Assad, then we must move to destroy his air force.

Vilifying all immigrants is factually wrong, and causes fear which undermines the census and many other government functions. We need an accurate #2020 Census.
Authorities should focus on arresting criminals. Not breaking up families, deporting hard working people who are part of the fabric of the community.
@IngrahamAngle attacks California for suing #Trump administration. Fails to mention that California usually wins, because #Trump violates law again and again.
Since she can’t change the Constitution, she and others on the #Trump right want to prevent census from being accurate by depressing participation.
She admits the object of citizenship question on Census is to undercount immigrants, because she disagrees with clear words of Constitution- the enumeration must include “all persons”
Thread: Went on @IngrahamAngle tonight. She tries to prove that #Trump was right to say Mexican Immigrants are typically rapists and murderers, by showing pictures of half dozen terrible criminals. Her crack staff could easily find a dozen terrible crimes committed by blonde guys
Today, I stand with those marching across the world to #EndGunViolence and I remain committed to working in Congress to end this epidemic. Today, we  #MarchForOurLives, but every day moving forward we will fight to say #NeverAgain.
#Trump’s assault on our servicemen and women is cowardly and disgusting. His #TransMilitaryBan is bad for the military and bad for our country. No one with the strength and bravery to serve in the U.S. military should be turned away because of who they are. #ProtectTransTroops
At least #Trump isn’t ignoring the #China trade deficit. But does he have a plan to deal with China's response? And was it wise to go after U.S. allies on metals just days before?

#NunesMemo is irrelevant to Trump, Mueller, and collusion. Slightly relevant to whether FISA court protects our privacy. So why is #NunesMemo touted by GOP members who have always voted against privacy?
#NunesMemo irrelevant to the credibility of Mueller and investigation of Trump collusion says Ryan “This memo is not an indictment of the FBI, of the Department of Justice. It does not impugn Mueller’s Russia investigation or the deputy attorney general.”
#NunesMemo tries to prove that the FBI, under James Comey, made a small mistake regarding an advisor Trump had already fired. Desperate attempt to use an irrelevancy to discredit Mueller—who wasn’t in government at the time.
#NunesMemo is a biased political diatribe masquerading as Intel. FBI, under Trump-appointed McCabe, says “we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” Schiff memo is accurate, balanced &amp; fills-in the “material omissions.”
Our thoughts and prayers are with those injured in the recent accident involving the train carrying our Republican colleagues to their retreat.
Long speech with few policy proposals.  Very few that will have bipartisan support. #SOTU
Trump talks tough on North Korea. But he's unwilling to pressure China sufficiently.  In 2017, North Korea made more progress toward being able to nuke American cities than any prior year. #SOTU
The original deal was Dreamers for border security.  Now Trump wants border security, a Wall, end family reunification, cancel the diversity visa, slash Legal immigration.  And our firstborn. #SOTU
Now he’s implying immigrants are disproportionately engaged in violent crime. That is false. #AlternativeFacts  #SOTU
He claims he will deliver better trade policy.  But he’s delivered nothing in last year. And see our China trade deficit since he took over. https://t.co/cAnBIGgryU
Almost thirty minutes into this speech and not one policy proposal.  Are we engaged in governing here? #SOTU
The President just said that the economy has added 2.4M jobs since the election–that includes 3 months during Obama's presidency. In the first 11 months of #Trump’s presidency, 1.8M jobs were created, compared with 2.1M jobs in the 11 months before his inauguration.  #SOTU
Praising Americans who have done heroic things will get bipartisan applause.  But hope to hear policy proposals that get bipartisan applause. #SOTU
Unlike most #SOTU, copies of speech text not available on Floor.
#Trump has called the @BLS_gov unemployment statistics “fake” 19 times. Tonight he will cite those same @BLS_gov statistics. Truth is that President Obama cut the unemployment rate in half. #ThanksObama. And we had slower job growth in 2017, than any of the prior 5 years. #SOTU
Tune in to @KFIAM640 at 3:00 PM to hear my thoughts on tonight's #SOTU on the @johnandkenshow.
At his 1974 #SOTU Nixon said Watergate investigation should terminate. Six months later, the Judiciary Committee voted that Nixon Obstructed Justice, and he resigned. Tonight, Trump will say “No Collusion” “Fake News”. #ObstructionofJustice
The law only deterred because some people were afraid it would be implemented. That fear is now gone. Not to mention the Trump Administration's decision is on its face illegal. Laws must be enforced--even if #Trump thinks they’re unnecessary, or even if Trump fears Kompromat.
.@StateDept says it does not need to sanction anyone for doing business with Russian defense or intelligence sectors. They say that some big transactions have been canceled, so the law is achieving its purpose. Wrong.
Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Stephanie Yellin-Mednick, a school nurse with the L.A. Unified School District and a member of the @schoolnurses (National Association of School Nurses), to discuss children's health and school nurse staffing issues. https://t.co/xgeMRN0xbG

Just heard Orr Yakobi has been released from @ICEgov custody!  Thanks to everyone who got involved.  I hope this solves his unique problem--but #Trump still plans to end #DACA for everyone on March 5. #FreeOrr
On October 26 @TuckerCarlson said he'd have me back "when we have a #TaxBill" (https://t.co/bQnXqrSk6e).  The #TaxScam is signed into law and he still can't defend it.  That's why I called him out today (https://t.co/E8m7GRKRWF).

Very concerned about the news that #WellsFargo forced unnecessary insurance on auto loan customers. I urge the @USOCC to investigate fully.
(3/3)But we need to be ready to talk too, and ready to accept a freeze, something far less than denuclearization for the foreseeable future.
(2/3) China cannot have it both ways; it cannot do business as usual with both the U.S. and while subsidizing North Korea…

(2/2) Pass my bill the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act with @SherrodBrown to give 3.5M victims their day in court. https://t.co/qnKHujdip6
(1/2) #WellsFargo may have opened 1.4 M more fraudulent accounts than they admitted. https://t.co/8jahhcy0TK
(4/4) Of course I know #Trump announced China deal to distract from firing Comey. But China deal is so bad it could be the other way around.
(3/4) Also means higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, while lowering costs for Chinese manufacturers...
(2/4) Now we will sell natural gas to #China. That means higher utility bills for U.S. consumers...
(1/4)Did #Trump fire Comey to distract from trade capitulation to China? Refuses to label them currency manipulator or demand balanced trade
Some applauded as US Intel secrets are published. Now health systems in UK etc. shut down. Innocent people will die https://t.co/ENRcDzynnz
This morning’s rant from #TweeterInChief #Trump is all the proof we need for a #SpecialCounsel. No more spin. #FollowTheFacts https://t.co/cJafVACjJF
Acting FBI Director McCabe said Comey had “broad support” of FBI. While Trump says he was going to fire him regardless. #WhatIsTrumpHiding?
#Trump’s purported reason for firing Comey: He wasn’t nice or fair enough to HRC. What’s the real reason? #WhatIsTrumpHiding #SpecialCounsel
On Tuesday the House reconvenes &amp; I will introduce legislation compelling the AG to appoint special counsel on #RussianHacking #ComeyFiring.
#Comey error slight.  Emails got to Weiner laptop via “back-up of devices” rather than “forwarding of email.” What’s real reason for firing?
#Trump fired #Comey. Nixon fired Cox, Richardson, and Ruckelshaus. Didn’t work then, won’t work now. #SpecialCounsel
#Trump fires #Comey. No reason given. What’s Trump trying to hide? More than ever, need #SpecialCounsel to investigate Trump and #Russia.
(3/3)Feb 13 Flynn fired not while subject to blackmail, only when Trump embarrassed. Trump: no concern for Nat. Sec. Only cares about image.
(2/3) February 9 @WashingtonPost published that Flynn talked to Russia about sanctions. With facts out Flynn no longer subject to blackmail.
(1/3) On January 26 #Trump learned that Gen. Flynn could be blackmailed by Russia from Sally Yates. Flynn was not fired.
Unfortunately my appearance on Tucker Carlson was cancelled, he doesn't believe the Sally Yates hearing was newsworthy.
Tonight I’ll be on @TuckerCarlson at 8 PM ET/5 PM PT discussing testimony from Former DAG Sally Yates and Gen. Clapper on #Russia and #Flynn

#Trump inviting Rodrigo Duterte to the White House undermines American credibility on #HumanRights. Rookie mistake. https://t.co/q5g8eZ3G9L
.@GOP's #AHCA failed again. Who knew removing essential health benefits would be a bad idea? Maybe they don’t want to #MakeAmericaSickAgain
#100DaysofTrump &amp; 470 positions don’t even have nominees, over 100 @StateDept alone. Having no one probably better than those he’d appoint.
Trump thought presidency would be easier than his previous life. He played golf 16 times &amp; spent 20 days @ Mar-a-Lago. Sounds rough #100Days
(2/2)Guess whose business empire consists of partnerships and LLCs? With 100 entities earning profits abroad. Let’s see Trump’s tax returns.
(1/2) #Trump’s tax plan cuts rate to 15% or more for partnerships and LLCs. 0% if profits earned abroad.
Today #Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at expanding off shore drilling. Bad for California. Good for Big Oil. #100DaysOfTrump

Trump will pressure China only slightly, no tariffs. Wallstreet wins. China will take only token steps against N. Korea. Kim Jong-un wins.
At classified briefing @VP urged members to "convey the Administration's level of resolve to confront N. Korea." That resolve is weak, phony

#Trump has legal authority to put tariffs on #China now. But Wall Street says no and Trump wimps out #JointSession
Trump laments our near $800 billion trade deficit in goods. But it's likely to be worse under his policies. #JointSession
Russia won't be able to hire trump aides as lobbyists. Not sure they need lobbyists #Jointsession
#Trump takes credit for every private sector investment. Takes no responsibility for the huge trade deficit of last 30 days. #Jointsession
#Trump promises new infrastructure. But proposes no money to pay for it. #JointSession
Republicans are cheering for #Trump more loudly than they did for George W. Bush 16 years ago. #JointSession
Excerpts from #Trump's speech just released. Big promises. No practical plans. Giant deficits likely. #JointSession
Guess Trump’s proposed cut of $18.5 billion to diplomacy necessitates an increase of more than $50 billion to defense #TalkIsCheaperThanWar
