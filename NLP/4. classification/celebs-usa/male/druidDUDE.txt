Whaaaaaaaaat was that?
censorship isn‚Äôt always overt. For example, the gov't could've said that if they released it, they‚Äôd make it very hard for it to be seen (small theaters, no advertising, etc). That's still censorship, it‚Äôs just not obvious, but it‚Äôs even more dangerous because people dont notice.
@Linda_Grace74 @kupkasimone67 @BoyErased 100% The studio doesn't want to piss off the government.
If a studio won't say it so they don't get in trouble, then we have to.
Also, Bolsonaro doesn't have to personally make the decision, but because of the anti-lgbtq environment he's created and cultivated, that will translate into decisions like this. Moreover, it's being investigated.
Contrary to popular belief, this is not "fake news." We know what type of people use that phrase. The studio didn't give a specific reason for pulling the movie, but when you have a release date and a contract and it suddenly gets pulled...This is what censorship looks like.
@ROGERSMYCAP @BoyErased it's ok, I can only see tweets from people who follow me and you know none of them do haha
@bradleysattler @TrejosTacos of course!
Well hellooooo Postmates delivery man!
@janemarielynch @yashar @scooterbraun Jane, will you get me one plz??? I need it!
And so it begins, @BoyErased was just banned in Brazil. Bolsonaro is dangerous and a threat to the LGBTQ+ community in Brazil. Censoring a movie about the dangers of conversion therapy is just the beginning.

Our tax dollars and politicians should all be used to implement policies that best achieve these ends. It seems like simple concept but I think many Americans would disagree.
Is this not our moral imperative to take care of one another? To treat all with dignity? In the wealthiest country in human history, healthcare, education &amp; earning a livable wage should not be a privilege but a right for all.

Listen to these parent's, friends and family talk about their loved ones they lost so you know who we must fight for. No place is safe. We can't let this be for nothing. I'm fucking angry. There is no excuse!!
I'm so sad. I'm devasted and appalled and horrified and I'm angry. A dozen innocent people died last night. They join an already unfathomably long list of those lost or injured in the past year alone from mass shootings. Yet, NOTHING has been done to try to help.

.@RandPaul's comments commending Trump for taking the Putin meeting, after having seen what Trump said are inexcusable and dangerous. We have not gone "over the top with this thing." You are enabling and complicit in Russia's interference.
side note: Putin overdid it with the filler this last go-around.
Elected officials, GOP &amp; Dems: If you don't publicly denounce this President after today and do nothing to hold him accountable, WE ARE VOTING YOU OUT.  Everyone else: YOU MUST VOTE IN NOVEMBER. This midterm could very easily be the most important election of our lifetime.
President Traitor. President Complicit. President Puppet. President Putin. Take your pick. They all apply.
Trump is weak, pathetic, idiotic and his incompetence is quite literally  ruining the American democracy. Russia committed an act of war - ACT LIKE IT. We are under attack and our president is too dumb and scared to even realize it.

I meannnnnn... https://t.co/RgybEf8pcA
Also, it feels good to complain about something like this because the US is on fire and idek where to start with any of that.
This also wouldn‚Äôt have happened had they changed the final set rules to allow tie-breaks after that 11hr Isner match in 2010. IT‚ÄôS 2018, WIMBLEDON.
I love #Wimbledon so much, but delaying the women‚Äôs FINAL because the men haven‚Äôt finished is exactly what we‚Äôve all been marching in the streets about. It‚Äôs sexist, disrespectful and offensive to the 2 finalists that worked to get there. They deserve a set start time. Bullshit.

Dear POC, asylum seekers, any non-white person in the U.S., the United States is Racist. Our political leaders are racist. The people that voted for them are racist. A lot of these people don't even realize they're racist.

@milscarf This policy started in April of this year. You can pick and choose conspiracies you‚Äôd like to believe but it doesn‚Äôt make it true &amp; it doesn‚Äôt help the children who are without their parents in a warehouse tonight. You have no humanity, if you think this is ok. Disgusting.
THE GOV'T SAYS YOU CAN ONLY SEEK ASYLUM IF YOU ENTER THROUGH PORTS OF ENTRY, BUT CONCURRENTLY THEY'VE ALSO CLOSED ALL OF THOSE PORTS OF ENTRY ON THE (AT LEAST) TX/MEX BORDER, LEAVING THE ASYLUM SEEKERS WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.THIS IS HAPPENING. 2300+ KIDS HAVE BEEN TAKEN SINCE APRIL
IT'S ALSO NOT ILLEGAL OR A CRIMINAL ACT TO SEEK ASYLUM IN OUR COUNTRY. SO WHEN A CHILD IS  TAKEN AWAY FORM THEIR PARENT, THAT'S BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOOSING TO DO SO WHEN IT'S NOT LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO.
THE US IS COMMITTING CHILD ABUSE AS A STRATEGY. A POLITICAL STRATEGY AND AS A DETERRENT FOR IMMIGRANTS. YOUR CHRISTIANITY, VALUES, HUMANITY &amp; MORALITY ARE FAKE. THERE IS NOTHING "PRO-LIFE" ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

Yet this article is completely absent from your homepage, @CNN. THIS is the story of the year. WE let Puerto Rico down. What did our government do to try to save our brothers and sisters? 4,645 lives gone and the government said it was 66 and then let them die. https://t.co/9MESDcu14Q
@ProbzTexas That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, they have/are being looked at (which is great), and we have results. However the CDC has been blocked from studying gun violence by the NRA for decades. That‚Äôs what we should also be studying. That‚Äôll show responsible gun owners don‚Äôt shoot up schools too.
@ProbzTexas Just because she ‚Äúfeels‚Äù like it might be right doesn‚Äôt mean it. There are countless studies upon studies showing how that‚Äôs wholly inaccurate logic and factually incorrect. The numbers speak for themselves.
@ProbzTexas Where did I say there aren‚Äôt responsible gun owners in my tweet? Reading comprehension.
@aiherbalist Can‚Äôt pick and choose your facts either
Well, @DianeBlackTN, as someone who has watched a bit (üëÄ) of porn and a lot of violent movies and video games - I‚Äôve had exactly 0% inclination to go shoot up a school or shoot anything anywhere. Also, things called ‚Äústudies‚Äù with ‚Äúfacts‚Äù also say there‚Äôs no correlation. https://t.co/5J8dU3Qb0w

@ioweegian Which is, btw, what I‚Äôve always done. Furthermore, a tweet about how I feel about an Ariana Grande song is hardly a ‚Äúcoming out.‚Äù I said a comment that I would‚Äôve said (and actually did) to my friends. So, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúplaying‚Äù at anything. Everyone should do what feels right to them
@ioweegian Well, sure, according to your definition of being ‚Äúout,‚Äù which seems to consist of making some public declaration to people I do not know. Shouldn‚Äôt me, living my personal life openly and not being defined or classified by what I post of social media to strangers count for more?
@chuanyucchan So that short video was cut down from about an hour of us talking a lot about boys. Just because u didn‚Äôt see it doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen and also doesn‚Äôt mean my 1 bad date story was in fact with a girl.

the CDC isn't even allowed to STUDY gun violence. How is this possible in 2018!? We are void of humanity.
Ok, well you can get hung up on the verbiage all you want, but that doesn't negate what a semi-automatic rifle just killed 17 people today and 50+ in Vegas. Call it whatever name you want...people can't do that with the bare hands. Mental health + gun control. https://t.co/FhBWzcJTAa
@alli_pop22 it's not a "one or the other" situation. It's both. Someone who's mentally ill can't just walk into a school and kill 16+ people without a high powered weapon.
