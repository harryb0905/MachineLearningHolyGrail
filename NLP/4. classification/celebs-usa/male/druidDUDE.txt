At gun point, I’m forced to eat a bunch of Big Macs that I share with locals just barely on the US side of the US/Mexico border, whilst Donald Trump, also at gun point, has to watch through the slats of the “wall” on the Mexican side and he’s not allowed to re-enter.

Thankfully, it might’ve been a false alarm. I’m happy everyone’s ok but sad that this is a situation that’s possible every day and for those who were locked down for hours not knowing how it’d all turn out.
My bro is currently on lockdown because there’s an active shooter at the university where he’s a professor. Fuck this fuck this fuck this. Only in America. Plz everyone stay safe and barricaded in place.

Whaaaaaaaaat was that?
censorship isn’t always overt. For example, the gov't could've said that if they released it, they’d make it very hard for it to be seen (small theaters, no advertising, etc). That's still censorship, it’s just not obvious, but it’s even more dangerous because people dont notice.
@Linda_Grace74 @kupkasimone67 @BoyErased 100% The studio doesn't want to piss off the government.
If a studio won't say it so they don't get in trouble, then we have to.
Also, Bolsonaro doesn't have to personally make the decision, but because of the anti-lgbtq environment he's created and cultivated, that will translate into decisions like this. Moreover, it's being investigated.
Contrary to popular belief, this is not "fake news." We know what type of people use that phrase. The studio didn't give a specific reason for pulling the movie, but when you have a release date and a contract and it suddenly gets pulled...This is what censorship looks like.
@ROGERSMYCAP @BoyErased it's ok, I can only see tweets from people who follow me and you know none of them do haha
@bradleysattler @TrejosTacos of course!
Well hellooooo Postmates delivery man!
@janemarielynch @yashar @scooterbraun Jane, will you get me one plz??? I need it!
And so it begins, @BoyErased was just banned in Brazil. Bolsonaro is dangerous and a threat to the LGBTQ+ community in Brazil. Censoring a movie about the dangers of conversion therapy is just the beginning.

Our tax dollars and politicians should all be used to implement policies that best achieve these ends. It seems like simple concept but I think many Americans would disagree.
Is this not our moral imperative to take care of one another? To treat all with dignity? In the wealthiest country in human history, healthcare, education &amp; earning a livable wage should not be a privilege but a right for all.

@AprilLyn03 You're conflating 2 very different things. No one said one is more important than the other. Sure, accidents happen every day and are horrible. However, this situation is not accidental and is a direct result of horrible political policy.
@AprilLyn03 An innocent child died on Christmas because of something political. That's a fact. So, it's definitely allowed. You can't pick and choose what's actually happening in the world just because it's a holiday.
Merry Christmas to everyone but the people who support this administration and its quite literal lethal policies. No family deserves to go through what this little boy's family is currently going through. https://t.co/vwAyCsljqJ

And now he’s talking on the phone...on speaker phone. In public. In a restaurant. But because it’s outside and loud, he’s shouting into the phone.

Never not embarrassed by Trump, but never more proud to have lived 1/2 my life in California (the worlds 5th largest economy).
Maybeeeee, Putin moved up the meeting and Trump didn't want to upset Daddy. Double win to get out of the rain! Can visit those dead soldiers another time! Right!?
This is how it’s done. 👏👏👏 https://t.co/QWoogA98Ll
Dear veterans and all current military who support Trump, just know that your boy doesn’t even have the balls to step outside in some drizzle to honor your fallen brothers &amp; sisters. So what makes you think he cares about you? He will never know courage or respect like you do.

It's amazing the fear drummed up over a harmless caravan of asylum-seekers, but god forbid we address the actual violence problem at home concerning white male citizens slaughtering 100's and injuring 1000's each year...
@ira @KaraRBrown @louisvirtel can I stand on stage and bring u water when u need it?
Listen to these parent's, friends and family talk about their loved ones they lost so you know who we must fight for. No place is safe. We can't let this be for nothing. I'm fucking angry. There is no excuse!!
I'm so sad. I'm devasted and appalled and horrified and I'm angry. A dozen innocent people died last night. They join an already unfathomably long list of those lost or injured in the past year alone from mass shootings. Yet, NOTHING has been done to try to help.

While Trump &amp; his followers fear monger about how dangerous brown people are, it's still and always has been the white male who's marching into schools, places of worship and entertainment and mowing innocents down. Always. Domestic terrorists look like me, not someone of color.
I'm dumbfounded. @aprivatewar is the best movie I've seen all year. It's brutal. It's unimaginably important and Rosamund Pike deserves all the awards. All of them. wowowow.

It starts at the top. Trump repeatedly and intentionally preys on those who are easily manipulated into taking his word as truth and adopting his hateful rhetoric as their own. He has the audience, what he says matters. VOTE THEM OUT. VOTE THEM OUT. VOTE THEM OUT.

@SAMGREIS I'm sorry! He was in love, what as I to do!?
Had a dream about Shawn M. last night. We were at a concert and he was...flirting with me....in front of my bf and even kissed my hand (I let him). Then I ran away like, "Can you believe the audacity!?"

HE SHOULDNT HAVE TO BE TOLD HE WAS WRONG. HE TOLD US HIS TRUTH 24HRS AGO. BELIEVE HIM.
Dear rest of the world, we’re used to Trumps antics and insane, dangerous rhetoric. This week you’ve now gotten a taste of what goes on here daily. We’ve let you down, but know a majority of Americans did not choose this monster. HELP US BY SHOWING HIM WHAT REAL LEADERSHIP IS.
This needs to be applied to the nation. https://t.co/91LBLlsmam
.@RandPaul's comments commending Trump for taking the Putin meeting, after having seen what Trump said are inexcusable and dangerous. We have not gone "over the top with this thing." You are enabling and complicit in Russia's interference.
side note: Putin overdid it with the filler this last go-around.
Elected officials, GOP &amp; Dems: If you don't publicly denounce this President after today and do nothing to hold him accountable, WE ARE VOTING YOU OUT.  Everyone else: YOU MUST VOTE IN NOVEMBER. This midterm could very easily be the most important election of our lifetime.
President Traitor. President Complicit. President Puppet. President Putin. Take your pick. They all apply.
Trump is weak, pathetic, idiotic and his incompetence is quite literally  ruining the American democracy. Russia committed an act of war - ACT LIKE IT. We are under attack and our president is too dumb and scared to even realize it.

Also, it feels good to complain about something like this because the US is on fire and idek where to start with any of that.
This also wouldn’t have happened had they changed the final set rules to allow tie-breaks after that 11hr Isner match in 2010. IT’S 2018, WIMBLEDON.
I love #Wimbledon so much, but delaying the women’s FINAL because the men haven’t finished is exactly what we’ve all been marching in the streets about. It’s sexist, disrespectful and offensive to the 2 finalists that worked to get there. They deserve a set start time. Bullshit.

Fear is one helluva motivator. Convince enough white people that their place in society is being threatened, diminished or that they need to take responsibility for the unbalanced privilege they’ve inherited &amp; you get Trump’s America. Irrational fears can’t sustain a country. 👌
Like bitch, no one cares about your whiteness, only you do!
All the old angry white republicans in my mentions again hahaha. I don’t understand how white people can feel like their whiteness is under attack, but I do understand that they feel like this current gov’t is supporting that idiotic ideology. Tribalism at its finest. Read books.
@arnoldp63 That’s the dumbest shit haha tf does that even mean?
This is no longer a viable excuse. Everyone needs to educate themselves because your non-vote is impacting the rest of the country. https://t.co/NtaQHXLTVU
Hey hey, fuck off everyone who voted for Trump or didn’t vote at all. The SCOTUS is going to be a dumpster fire and it’s your fault and we’re going to have to live with that for the rest of our lives. 👏👏👏👏

@JSullivanCoach Different Kevin McHale
But to be fair you are safe to assume I’m no longer religious.
@phattonez U didn’t get it. Point taken.
@Qhcarey02 Nah, that’s just a Brazilian thing. Not religious.
You’re assuming I’m not Christian, but furthermore you think only Christians can understand and interpret the biggest selling book of all time? I’m not a wizard, but I still love the Harry Potter series! Tfyt!  And for your records I was raised and confirmed Catholic. https://t.co/J34pWpxXGf
I don’t mind it! I’m enjoying the blaring hypocrisy of it all! 😘
A lot of old angry white “Christians” in my mentions this am. Putting “Jesus” in your bio and then calling me all kinds of names makes it clear you don’t understand your politics AND your religion.
@FearTheUnread NBA Kevin McHale was at the rally. However, this Kevin McHale was not.

Dear POC, asylum seekers, any non-white person in the U.S., the United States is Racist. Our political leaders are racist. The people that voted for them are racist. A lot of these people don't even realize they're racist.

VOTE. THEM. THE FUCK. OUT.
@milscarf This policy started in April of this year. You can pick and choose conspiracies you’d like to believe but it doesn’t make it true &amp; it doesn’t help the children who are without their parents in a warehouse tonight. You have no humanity, if you think this is ok. Disgusting.
THE GOV'T SAYS YOU CAN ONLY SEEK ASYLUM IF YOU ENTER THROUGH PORTS OF ENTRY, BUT CONCURRENTLY THEY'VE ALSO CLOSED ALL OF THOSE PORTS OF ENTRY ON THE (AT LEAST) TX/MEX BORDER, LEAVING THE ASYLUM SEEKERS WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.THIS IS HAPPENING. 2300+ KIDS HAVE BEEN TAKEN SINCE APRIL
IT'S ALSO NOT ILLEGAL OR A CRIMINAL ACT TO SEEK ASYLUM IN OUR COUNTRY. SO WHEN A CHILD IS  TAKEN AWAY FORM THEIR PARENT, THAT'S BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS CHOOSING TO DO SO WHEN IT'S NOT LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO.
THE US IS COMMITTING CHILD ABUSE AS A STRATEGY. A POLITICAL STRATEGY AND AS A DETERRENT FOR IMMIGRANTS. YOUR CHRISTIANITY, VALUES, HUMANITY &amp; MORALITY ARE FAKE. THERE IS NOTHING "PRO-LIFE" ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

Talking about illegal immigrants with my 99 yr old super conservative grandmother is hilarious. She just laughs and puts her head in her hands and says, “I still love you!” After I completely disagree with her.

@ProbzTexas That’s what I’m saying, they have/are being looked at (which is great), and we have results. However the CDC has been blocked from studying gun violence by the NRA for decades. That’s what we should also be studying. That’ll show responsible gun owners don’t shoot up schools too.
@ProbzTexas Just because she “feels” like it might be right doesn’t mean it. There are countless studies upon studies showing how that’s wholly inaccurate logic and factually incorrect. The numbers speak for themselves.
@ProbzTexas Where did I say there aren’t responsible gun owners in my tweet? Reading comprehension.
@aiherbalist Can’t pick and choose your facts either
Well, @DianeBlackTN, as someone who has watched a bit (👀) of porn and a lot of violent movies and video games - I’ve had exactly 0% inclination to go shoot up a school or shoot anything anywhere. Also, things called “studies” with “facts” also say there’s no correlation. https://t.co/5J8dU3Qb0w

@SAMGREIS Because we don’t have any gay pop stars as big as Brandy and Monica at the time! Sooooon, surely it has to be soon. Wait, we have Sam Smith. We need 1 more.

Furthermore, #Screwed  is the most accurate, beautiful, therapeutic song I’ve heard about the state of the world and simultaneously makes me get tf down!

@vidalporter @billyeichner @djkhaled Eatin’ booty isn’t exclusive to homos
@anaserhall 👏👏👏
@billyeichner @djkhaled Furthermore, has anyone really lived if they don’t?
It is really wild that, in 2018 US, there’s a network like Fox News that is just blatant state propaganda. Like, they don’t HAVE to do that, but yet they’re choosing to further distort the truth for millions of Americans every day, by breathing oxygen into their fire of hysteria.
This is the realest shit you’ve ever said. https://t.co/nw2sLwGf1P

I love catching someone sneaking a pic of me whilst I shovel food into my mouth and really committing to the death glare right down the barrel of the camera just a lil too long to make sure they got it.
I’ve been up for 2 hrs and I’m ready to go back to bed.
@JustinThorneMe That’s an open relationship with a secrecy kink.
@JustinThorneMe That’s just an open relationship

@samisblond EXCUSE ME SAM?
@AspireWriter21 I can’t drink coffee
@SareyGamp well my assertion that this was an educational problem was wrong and problematic within itself. Kanye is educated and has no excuse. I was conflating different issues which doesn't help.
@nikkiLynette beautifully said.
this was dumb. imma delete it because it's wrong and I don't agree with it.
@nikkiLynette you're right.
@JoeHWolff You’re right. Hence why I shouldn’t be anywhere near making the big decisions haha.
@chrisbaker2121 Couldn’t be further...
@TrippyyyyJ You’re right.

@ddahobachir well yeah, they are!
correction* I am mad. because saying those wholly inaccurate statements is dangerous. What I meant to say is that maybe this can be used to publicly show someone how wrong they are and how to get them tf back on track.
@m0m0bryan Well yeah, that's exactly what I said. I 100% agree with you.
AMEN https://t.co/LFXLBDlagv
@KainaRaimundo And dangerous
@_D_o_r_y_A_n_n_ 100% agree. Furthermore, what he’s doing is dangerous. That’s why what @VanLathan said was really what every one needs to hear.
Well, when you say slavery was a "choice," which to me is akin to being a holocaust denier, I think you lose people with that argument because that's not an opinion. That's just 100% WRONG. And beyond disrespectful and hurtful to generations affected by slavery. https://t.co/ZzLft1ZqHN
@Mochamarguerite I'm not giving him a pass and 100% agree with everything you just said. All I mean to say is, why did we expect anything more?
@rosedud5555 Agreed.
@LINY850 @kanyewest who tf said he's right? He's not even in the ballpark of being right.
@conscious_sis enough to elect a president. I mean they're dead wrong about this shit, but someone needs to tell them wtf is up.

@RyanVickers10 At the same time, what NK is doing can still be wrong and horrific whilst simultaneously not forgiving America’s past. They coexist.
@RyanVickers10 Well, they are facts. I don’t implore fake news sites. Here’s where I agree with you: yes, there are people starving and it’s unforgivable; yes, the criminal justice system needs extensive reform; yes, we did and I can’t even begin to imagine the horrors it caused.

@exfairy_ really well said :) it has definitely been an enlightening experience for me as well! Glad to have someone like you under the flag 🏳️‍🌈
@JordanUhl this is fucking unreal.
@ioweegian Well, also fortunately, it’s not ever my concern about what other people may think about my personal life. I’m happy and content and that’s all I can control. :)
@ioweegian Which is, btw, what I’ve always done. Furthermore, a tweet about how I feel about an Ariana Grande song is hardly a “coming out.” I said a comment that I would’ve said (and actually did) to my friends. So, I’m not “playing” at anything. Everyone should do what feels right to them
@ioweegian Well, sure, according to your definition of being “out,” which seems to consist of making some public declaration to people I do not know. Shouldn’t me, living my personal life openly and not being defined or classified by what I post of social media to strangers count for more?
@chuanyucchan So that short video was cut down from about an hour of us talking a lot about boys. Just because u didn’t see it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen and also doesn’t mean my 1 bad date story was in fact with a girl.
@itsflawless19 by no means comparing myself to Jodie Foster (because I'm an irrelevant has-been) but the point still stands: https://t.co/f48ykqOInU

Going to sleep thinking of the families who lost someone today and how none of the GOP have any dignity and respect for their fellow citizens as they continue to not do a single thing to prevent this from happening to more children and families. You should all be ashamed.
the CDC isn't even allowed to STUDY gun violence. How is this possible in 2018!? We are void of humanity.
Ok, well you can get hung up on the verbiage all you want, but that doesn't negate what a semi-automatic rifle just killed 17 people today and 50+ in Vegas. Call it whatever name you want...people can't do that with the bare hands. Mental health + gun control. https://t.co/FhBWzcJTAa
@alli_pop22 it's not a "one or the other" situation. It's both. Someone who's mentally ill can't just walk into a school and kill 16+ people without a high powered weapon.
