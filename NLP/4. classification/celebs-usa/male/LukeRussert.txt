This is a true story. Clinton looked at me and said, “Is that a computer or something?” My parents laughed quite hard. The 90s were so fun.

@Sugarcubedog No. Hillary is part of the conversation because the eventual Dem nominee will not want to repeat the same errors she made.
Obvious point here but it's an important one. Harris is very comfortable in her own skin. Seems at home and very relatable talking about issues in front of a large audience. The opposite of Hillary and a good counter balance to a bombastic Trump.

Also—there’s a dorm on campus that used to house the pages that is unoccupied. If you’re that cheap, go there and pay Uncle Sam hostel rates.
1. You make $174k a year w full benefits, if the $32k a year staffer can find housing so can you. 2. It’s gross. 3.

@JeremyWGR “Thank you Mr. Pegula. I’ll love you forever.”

@funnydanny As a season ticket holder since 1997, it’s apparent that the Wall &amp; Beal window has closed. Not going to beat BOS, TOR, MIL, PHL in a 7 game series. Time to burn it all down. Clean house. Fire the ball boy. (Unless somehow KD comes next yr which is a pipe dream.)

@SopanDeb Actually thought about this—Tailgating Caucus—each weekend you visit a different member’s alma-mater. You know how hard those SEC &amp; BIG10 alums would work to one up their colleagues? Tie in the liquor &amp; meat lobby. Pure gold.

I know cynicism pervades all talk re politics and I’ll be mocked for being a softy—but at its core it’s so sad that 800,000 hard working folks, many of them dedicated to the spirit of public service have to suffer because of an extreme right wing talking point.

@bgpowelll When you buy a NFL team for $60 it’s not that hard.
Sadly, my team owner suggestion a few years ago of trading Rodgers to the #Bills for a 5th round draft pick never materialized.
As a #Packers team owner I support this, mainly so that the #Bills can hire him in any position. https://t.co/4W3EhnNrvD

Hey @granthpaulsen &amp; @funnydanny I’m going to call in tomorrow and say based on RG3 completing a pass today, it’s clear the Skins made a massive error getting rid of him. Cc @BrendanDarr
@maxplaysmusic I’m for that but in order for this to work you have the keep the bowl cartel satisfied. God forbid you took their gate profit and pumped it back into the schools actually playing. I think gate from Bama hosting a playoff game would fund a season of Olympic sports.
Lastly, if any of the college presidents, bowl executives or NCAA officials say we can’t have an 8 team playoff due to final exams in December...they deserve to be vanquished to Siberia for hypocrisy against humanity.
@MattDSchubert 🐺
This also increases regional diversity. The west coast and Midwest should be represented in the playoffs every year.
This year- Bama, Clemson, OU, Udub, Ohio St automatic. ND, UCF and Georgia at large.  Bama vs UCF Clemson vs UDub ND vs Ohio St OU vs Georgia It makes too much sense it’ll never happen.
@McDeereUSA It’s so absurd. What’s it like 40 days on average?
It’s not hard. 8 team playoff. Power 5 winners guaranteed. Three at-large picks, one of those has to be non power 5. It would make the fat cats so much 💰&amp; fans would love it. https://t.co/UqG7tMUYAq

@bcatleagle Again—this is THE eternal Q re BC. Do you settle for a persistent 7-5 “character guy” or role the dice with an upstart that will win you an ACC title and leave you for a USC or Michigan. I want the upstart. Our AD has proven the upstart route is better.
Reminded of this gem of a 2004 quote from @JamesCarville in SI, “Put the NE Patriots in Michigan uniforms and they'd lose 2 out of 3 to Ohio State &amp; 2 out of 3 Rose Bowls. Michigan plays dull, uninspired, gutless football, year in and year out. Other than that, I like them fine."

We’ve long looked the other way on Saudi. As FDR once said re Nicaraguan dictator General Somoza, “He may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch.” IE weapons deals, oil, “ally in the region” and now Trump hotel stays.
I wish we had the same concern about Saudi Arabia’s decades long exportation of Wahhabism and grotesque human rights record as we do over a single murdered dissident. This behavior shouldn’t be surprising if you’ve read one book re 9/11 &amp; Middle East.

I’ve always wondered about this #TheMoreYouKnow https://t.co/AqJHwvYdWL

@JoshSchwerin Sup.
@Mikdel2 Many countries take care of their own citizens better than the USA. As for veteran care, the USA does the best for having such a large veteran population compared to other Western democracies. That being said, we fail our vets considerably.
@JoelDReports I’m all for that. I’m also for showing victims of school shootings. There will be no change till people see and feel the pain. A good friend lost his sister to opioids and that was my own wake up call re the power of personal feeling.
In a better country, this would garner more attention and create more outrage than somebody taking a knee. Alas, that is not our country. https://t.co/CSNH72tOEY

@pkcapitol @AlecMacGillis Yeah but his rain delay speech won them the World Series. No analytical value for that. It’s also priceless.
@ThisShowStinks @JasonLaCanfora @richardjustice Fair warning- @CillizzaCNN and I are in studio. So all those drinking the haterade, it’s a beautiful day in DC for a bike ride. Be sure to wear white.
@billsdaily Not a chance. Reid is best QB coach in the league.
I just watched the Mahomes left handed throw for the 10th time on the DVR. Beyond Favre-ian.
@RealBryanWatson Yup and he’s probably our best player.
@seungminkim @frankthorp I spy my fat head!
Lots of #Bills fans/analysts come up in my feed reminding us that the Bills traded the Chiefs the pick used for Mahomes. Remember, Mahomes has Andy Reid-best QB coach in the NFL &amp; a 💯 supporting cast. Mahomes doesn’t do this in Buffalo.
@lifewithmikey52 And you know what-it makes for a more relaxing October.
These game 163s make me so happy inside. It’s baseball catnip. I’m going to read every single article about the pitching strategies for the division losers as they head into the Wild Card tomorrow. So many decisions!!!
@craigcalcaterra Yup. Folks are forgetting that the SCOTUS is special- these aren't normal standards, they're supposed to be extraordinary ones. I want dull untainted brilliantly smart people. Personality of an airline pilot with a brain of a surgeon. There's enough out there.
@jvzanghi If you got rid of conferences that would be fantastic. That could happen in the future as we move to a league based on betting.
@grizzlyblair @JasonLaCanfora I did a legit spit take when I heard that. “The kids are watching...” 🤨
@hughhewitt @Browns Totally absurd. Coddling the QB to the extreme. Curse of Lake Erie.
@gunnerhal @stretchdogg @awfulannouncing @AndrewSiciliano It’s remarkable Sunday Ticket still isn’t on cable.
@nf_sabres_fan Hey...less than 5 years now where that is still a thing!
@JordanPThen That makes too much sense.
@nf_sabres_fan He had an affinity for the Miami rivalry. Liked the idea of the Fins coming to Buffalo in cold weather. I don’t begrudge him that, also liked the Bills as the only team with a NY stadium playing the ✈️.
It probably won’t happen but I hope to live to see the day the #Bills move to the AFC North and the #Ravens go to the AFC East. Imagine a fully drivable AFC North? Would be so great. Pitt &amp; Cle rivalries so natural.
@ScottHanson You’re the best Scott! Thanks for the explainer 👊🏽
@stretchdogg @awfulannouncing @AndrewSiciliano I’m sure SNF has some exclusivity tie in. It’s moronic in 2018 when the stupid stiffs like me are paying for RedZone and all the kids are streaming for free with some fire stick I can’t operate. Let me see the end!
@awfulannouncing That’s the dumbest rule still around. My goodness, stay on another 15 minutes.
@DougHeye @BresPolitico @pkcapitol @mikeviqueira @michael_steel Do you still have the matchbox bus? That was wild.
@pkcapitol @mikeviqueira @michael_steel Fiscal cliff New Years was crazy too.

Kavanaugh basically just called Whitehouse a nerd. That was peak PREP.
I'm waiting for Kavanaugh to say he was ALL-IAC and should have been ALL-MET.
If a woman or minority had an opening statement like that, they would be labeled hysterical and deranged. If you cannot see that as a white man--God love ya.

The emotion is certainly a better tone, good of him to defend his honor &amp; promote his pro women in the workplace ideology BUT BUT BUT the start of this was screaming about a liberal hit job by the Clintons &amp; "what goes around comes around." SCOTUS justices don't talk like that
@MikeMadden White Flint to be honest.
Oh boy-Kavanaugh is going full angry belittled marginalized white man. Tough sell for today.
I’m terrified of small prop planes. I’d rather 8 hours on a 787 than 8 minutes on a Cessna. I’ve flown them when I’ve had to though I avoid them when I can. That has no bearing on my ability to tell the truth.
Really dumb thing to say in Iowa and probably lost him the election but Bruce Braley looking pretty smart right now- https://t.co/1EgCVnvKak

Rachel Mitchell with some empathy there after Grassley went right into bumbling process jargon after a woman relived the most painful moment of her life in front of the entire world.
@LDCDee Absolutely. Of course I’d be content with a Congress of 100% women. Male ego games are a big part of the problem in Congress.
Many high profile law firms make their partners retire by 65-70. We got two 85 year olds in charge of the Judiciary Comt. I believe in senior wisdom but there’s a better way.
Watching these opening statements from octogenarians about an issue that aligns so much more strongly with younger generations makes me believe senators should be limited to four terms. Twenty-four years is enough time on the Hill.
@bone_dry_cuffs Thank God we're not in the playoff race. Ending the season with a 3 game set in a different time zone against a Rockies team fighting for their life.
Ok. Maybe they don’t call this game. 90% of the fans are leaving. So it’s over for most us.
And the Harper era ends on a called 3rd strike due to a☔️ shortened game. #Natitude
@JAMES_BASE_ATP @rolandsmartin Fair point. I just feel claiming racism re the trial does two unfortunate things- 1. Reinforces the terrible stereotype in much of white America that AAs play race card over everything. 2. Undermines the victims, especially AA women who have long been marginalized by society.
@rolandsmartin Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t Cosby criticized as a sellout to the race for the “Pound Cake” speech?

@MacWtheCheese I suppose it is. Always thought it was more common with the MVP but Cy Young has similar rate.
@BrendanSala5 Oh yeah you're right. Finished 3 back in the wild card that year.
@berniemike4 This 300 milestone will make it a heck of race. I'm partial to Max. Ultimate analytics vs "the gut."

@HousefromDC When you eat for free at Capital One Arena you can take the risk of putting against the Bills.
@MomNyack True-just more pronounced this time around. Perhaps Josh Gordon is the savior.
Pats are always good with BB. Pats now have the same record as the #Bills. Brady looks uninterested, senile and angry. Has nothing around him. Reminds me of Kobe in the Byron Scott years.
@Vanhonker I’m all for due process. It’s overrated in SCOTUS. All SCOTUS judges should be squeaky clean Eagle Scouts. Congress and the WH can have the problem children.
@Adam__Wagner They have plenty of time. McConnell doesn’t care about process.
It’s just odd. McConnell is the Belichick of politics and in this case there are plenty of viable free agents that know the system and can plug the hole. No need to deal with this drama.
@mwgarb Correct. There are plenty of 💯 conservative judges who aren’t accused of sexual crimes.
@MikeSacksEsq @burgessev They sidelined Miers and moved to Alito fine. Seems like a lot of spilled blood for nothing. #OwnTheLibs #FakeNews !!!
@tickerguy 1. That’s a reach. 2. There’s plenty of qualified conservative women to have two female nominees and or they’re already the most qualified.
Maybe I’ve been out of the game too long but why go to the mat so hard for Kavanaugh? Wouldn’t sidelining him and picking 46 year old Amy Coney Barrett be easier at this point? There’s enough white dudes from Prep on the SCOTUS.
@NicholasMendola @springsteen “Lemme just sing it.”
And condolences to all the survivor leagues that folded in week 3 because of today’s result. Usually can make it to the MLB playoffs.
On behalf of #BillsMafia I’d like to thank Las Vegas. A 16-17 point spread on a group of 53 grown ass professional men fighting for a pay check in week 3 is a helluva motivator. #NotDeadYet #GodSpeedVontae #AllenNotRosen #LetsGoBuffalo

Anybody else notice how quiet the arena was on that last possession by GSW? Impending feeling of doom that totally materialized.

We can all agree that officiating was garbage and that the league should make it up for it in game 2. Stop protecting Durant, call 100% of the hand-checks on LeBron. No double bonus for GS. We need this tied at 1-1.
@BradCromes @cavs Very true. Bad call.
What was worse?
JR’s goof shouldn’t overshadow LeBron setting up George freaking Hill for the game winner.

My grandpa, 2 &amp; 3 generations removed from Irish and German immigrants seeking economic opportunity, didn’t finish high school bc of that WWII thing. So only could get work as a garbage man &amp; truck driver. Raised 4 kids, including one who got a law degree &amp; became a journalist.

@TedLeonsis This is fantastic. Can’t wait.
@JoeLATrib @SnowElfPaladin I’m out of journalism but if I ever go back rest assured I’ll never shut up about this.
@SnowElfPaladin Think because of the energy and intensity of the Tea Party and how hardcore they were re spending in ‘11, ‘12, ‘13 etc that it was more real this time. But you’re right, it was all a lie.
And now full Trumpanomics- deficit inducing tax cut + higher defense &amp; domestic spending. Seen this movie before. Onward.
167 House #GOP supported this bill. Many of them had knives out for Boehner when he was trying to do the bare minimum with divided government. Frauds.
It’s pretty remarkable that everything I covered on the Hill from 2011-2016 re spending &amp; budgets was completely meaningless. Leadership has totally gutted the Boehner spending reforms. Never get tricked again, #GOP only cares about deficits, debt &amp; spending when a D is POTUS. https://t.co/qo3R7fjchh

@matthewstoller Give Newt credit for one thing, his reforms in ‘94 allowed the House GOP to change with the times really quickly really fast. Look at what the new members have done to them since 2010. That would never happen with Ds pushing left. Leadership won’t allow.
@matthewstoller Look at the House Dem Caucus, that should be a breeding ground of new “radical” ideas (see House Rs 2010-&gt;) the top 3 have been in place since 2003. Seniority rules all, machine politics, new ideas go nowhere

@DaveRowlen @EWErickson He’s a smart guy. He was tapped into the populist sentiment way before it was mainstream.
@EWErickson Where did Dems attack peaceful transfer of power?Mueller was appointed by a GOP DOJ after Sessions was comprised and Nunes of House Intel was compromised. It has led to former NSA advisor pleading guilty &amp; campaign chairman being charged. It should stop?
@EWErickson Erick you’re smarter than that. HRC conceded Weds AM. Obama had Trump into the Oval on Thurs. Never once did either say it was rigged or fraudulent something Trump has alluded to in the past for popular vote loss.
Reading about this bogus Roy Moore challenge, my biggest fear is that in 2020 a losing Trump actively attacks &amp; delegitimizes the peaceful transfer of power, the most positive and fragile enduring aspect of our democracy.

@Tjada @MickStrongin Go through the countries, read the investment risk, governance and economic reports. It’s not pretty.
@Tjada @MickStrongin I’ve seen it with my own eyes, so many wonderfully educated people who can’t get jobs bc they don’t know the right person in govt.
@Tjada @MickStrongin I’m sorry it’s not a generalization, continent is full of autocratic strongmen who employ a corrupt patronage system.
Lastly, if these “big game” hunters want to hunt lions, I’m cool with the importation if they hunted only w a knife. Then they deserve it.

The photo of Emmett Till’s disfigured body, killed at the hands of white supremacists helped a nation to realize the laws weren’t working

#Bills had a bad game. Yes. It happens. They could’ve easily been 7-0 or 3-4 heading into this game. They’re solid. Breath.

@SopanDeb Way better. But aside from the game 6 Celtics shot last year, people don’t remember.  And he just missed that one...
I love John Wall. He’s the best pure PG in the league. His jumper is still mediocre. That’s why he doesn’t get the Kyrie style adoration.
What’s the chess analogy for Beal canceling out Green? Bishop for a rook? #Wizards
@SopanDeb Any dude who wears a messenger bag to a NBA game deserves to be docked an automatic personal foul.

So in conclusion, know who our "friends" are and hope that American kids don't die in Iran or North Korea bc leaders need to be "tough."
BTW: I seemed to have missed the results of the last Saudi Arabia presidential elections...
Iran's last elections showed a sincere desire to moderate, disarm and continue dialogue with the West. ENEMY!
Our "friend" Saudi Arabia bred 15/19 9/11 hijackers, exports radical Wahhabism that led to ISIS and has an atrocious human rights record.
So we're back to Iran being the Great Satan and Saudi Arabia being our good natured well meaning friend. Forty more years of the same BS!

@JBabsSportsChic Game 2. Game 3 Hawks just beat down a listless squad.
@MattHelms1 It's just so inconsistent.
Story of this game is refs calling absurd fouls that are rarely called in reg season. I don't recall seeing so much foul trouble in NBA.
#Wizards play bad defense to begin with, way refs are calling this game has caused them to be even more passive. ATL uncontested 3s all day

UNPRECEDENTED use of parliamentary procedure that won the #GOP two midterm elections and a SCOTUS seat. McConnell---brilliant tactician.
So today, think of what Obama could have done with 51 Senate voters 2009-2015. #GOP will nuke the filibuster for all bills eventually
Trump wins, chooses Gorsuch. Dems filibuster. McConnell laughs, he's been playing this game for yrs-He uses Dems '13 option to nuke current
Again, McConnell is Bill Belichick and incredible master of exploiting every possible outcome in order to win.
McConnell wisely stops the pick because he knows #GOP apprehensive towards Trump will pull the lever for him w a SCOTUS seat in the balance
Obama's pick Garland, can't even get a hearing. UNPRECEDENTED never seen in #USA history https://t.co/nqAt3U3WRM
So Scalia dies in Feb of '16, roughly a year left in Obama's term and McConnell says b4 Scalia's body is even cold that Obama make pic
The #GOP and Mitch McConnell are 1000% more hardcore than #Dems they bring AR-15s to dodgeball. They knew this gave them huge opening.
The #GOP was thrilled Reid went nuclear because it gave them the tools to do it in the future- l said in 2013 https://t.co/KpEOrQ9ZQD https://t.co/rFYd7q7gL9
Reid and others grow sick of this so they decide to "go nuclear" to push Obama's federal judges in 2013. They had no choice they say.
This then causes Obama and Dems to look inept at times and greatly helps GOP win 2010 midterms by casting Dems as dysfunctional
What's the approach? Use a parliamentary procedure known as the filibuster in a way that totally breaks from historic precedent
Obama comes into office in 2009, McConnell, the Bill Belichick of politics comes up with a novel way to stop him: https://t.co/p1ttL9kEfL

@LukeRussert 6. This is very dangerous. I have trouble seeing somebody like Mike Rogers doing this. Intel Chairmen don't act like this.
@LukeRussert 5. Nunes acting on a "source" seems to have used his extremely important position to give Trump light cover on a manic tweet.
@LukeRussert Nunes, briefs Ryan, then runs to the WH to brief Trump. Then speaks to reporters without briefing the Intel Comt!?!?!?
@LukeRussert 3. So Nunes, gets a call from a "source" that claims intel agencies got "incidentally" picked up some stuff on Trump campaign?
@LukeRussert 2. So Trump WH looks terrible because he lied and implied his predecessor committed a crime.
@LukeRussert 1. This week every intel agency worth a damn has told Congress that Obama absolutely did NOT spy/tap Trump's phone

8. So it's unlikely to change unless those who control cable/network/local TV &amp; FB can get past the car wreck bait. Not gonna happen
7. TV is a profit business not built to properly deal with the current reality. Twitter is really just an echo chamber for fellow believers

Biden should call a mtg, get Brown, Casey, Baldwin, Stabenow &amp; Peters in a room. Go county by county, precinct by precinct. What happened?
Last night proved disruption is the new status quo, so no Dem should be thinking about "waiting their turn."
In the House, look at dynamic members like Jeffries, Kennedy, Gallego, Moulton &amp; Gabbard. Can they have a seat at the table?
#Dems to watch Brown, Warren, Booker, Murphy &amp; Klobuchar. Look at Masto in NV. Then what did Roy Cooper do right in NC?
Dem I really respect told me this AM, party is too close to Wall St, focused on social issues at expense of poverty &amp; not dynamic on Hill
Where do #Dems go now? They killed off Blue Dogs for a law that hurt them for 4 elexs. Obama coalition only there for O.
Do House Democrats return Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn to their Leadership posts? Or do #Dems young guns make their move?

Boston College football just won their first #ACC game since 2014. I'm off to buy a 24oz Modelo &amp; a lotto ticket. #BCEagles
@Les_East agreed. 4 in a row is actually more impressive than winning one but people will never get that.

"I don't know. Maybe? Who knows?" Trump's first public comments on whether to go to Iraq according to Donald Trump.
If Lester had said, "Yeah but you only opened your club because the WASPs at the Everglades Club found you unbearable?" #PalmBeach
I'm a racial healer because I opened up an inclusive club in Palm Beach.
Trump actively taking credit for trying to delegitimize America's first black president
"Take advantage of the laws of a nation." Donald J. Trump
Trump is a champion of infrastructure, Congressional #GOP views infrastructure spending as "boondoggles." So yeah no new airports.
"That makes me smart." Trump on not paying federal income taxes.
This would be shut down by the ESPN trade simulator because it's too good for HRC--33k emails for Trump's tax returns.

Digesting the Ted Cruz endorsement news and even by the standards of Washington it's pathetic, personification of why people hate pols.

4. I was at plenty of press conferences where the #GOP Leadership never took the issue head on, never said unequivocally "Obama is American"
3. Romney in 2012 admits that Trump and birtherism is wrong but he needs the votes for 50.1% https://t.co/ikHohPZR08
2. Trump was carnival barker re birtherism but in fact the entire #GOP was behind it by staying silent and letting belief grow among base

House of Cards season 5 opening scene 👉🏽 https://t.co/mHTNeOdCxl
Ryan says the mtg with Trump was positive, good for members to get access. More comfortable with Trump post mtg w House #GOP Conf.
Speaker Ryan: "I'm not going to get into tweet talk." Re Star of David Trump tweet controversy.
Ryan says House flr is last place where Rs &amp; Ds can get to know each other, if it turns into partisan war zone, w protests, bad precedent
That being said, Pelosi vigorously defended HRC, said #GOP was attacking Comey for political gain &amp; HRC is "the best."
Pelosi, Intel Comt member, tells me re HRC classified emails on personal server, "Out of 30k, about 100, too many, there shouldn't be one."
At 10:38am I tweeted #GOP would make this an attack ad-- https://t.co/sc2zATujPq at 10:54am they did! https://t.co/WlwEWhBNOc

On his comfort level with Trump, Leader McCarthy, "I'm always looking for constant improvement." #GOP
McCarthy tells me House Ds floor protest was "not a behavior becoming of the U.S. Congress" says #GOP Leadership won't tolerate it in future
Leader McCarthy calls FBI report on HRC email usage, "very troubling" "terrible judgment" worried that bar is set now for others to violate
What's remarkable after that Comey presser, is that the #GOP nominated the only person that can't make "judgment" a campaign issue.
With the Clintons it always comes down to judgment. 4 days of news-Bill meets w AG Lynch on a plane, FBI director excoriates her email usage
Shorter Comey: HRC knowingly used personal email for classified info,alarmingly careless &amp; reckless, used terrible judgement. BUT no charges
Comey: Our judgment, "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case" against HRC re emails.
Comey: It is possible hostile actors gained access to HRC email account
Shorter Comey: A Secretary of State should not have been this careless and reckless.
Comey: HRC &amp; team "extremely careless" in their handling of classified information
Comey: No evidence work related emails were intentionally deleted
Comey: 110 personal emails in 52 chains classified. 8 top secret. 36 secret. 8 confidential.

Here ends the reading.
10) Lastly, this has ALWAYS been political. From its formation (Boehner red meat to base) to it's release (19 days b4 #GOP convention).
9) Did it prove Hillary was in anyway responsible for 4 American deaths in Benghazi? Absolutely not. Nobody directly was. Fault all around
8) So yes Benghazi Comt did do something for the #GOP, it exposed Hillary's private email server, if there's a "smoking gun" that was it
7) All the questions about trust re Hillary, re shady practices at STATE, all goes back to that private email account.
6) BUT, what #Benghazi did was give the #GOP a fighting chance in this general, and if it wasn't for Trump, maybe an edge.
5) SO, you can re-litigate #Benghazi 10x over, Lord knows now 8 comts have tried. People will believe what their political interests are
4) So essentially Boehner ordering the investigation is what shed light on Clinton's email and her highly questionable setup
3) Nevertheless, if there is no #Benghazi Comt it's unclear if Hillary Clinton's private email setup ever comes to light.
2) Boehner relented after some new WH emails surfaced but in actuality he had to throw red meat to the base who were calling for his head
1) Boehner was reluctant to name it bc he thought it cld turn into a witch hunt and backfire, also 7 other comts had not found "smoking gun"
A few musings on #Benghazi Comt----
Gowdy won't publicly offer opinion on Hillary's leadership during #Benghazi, Pompeo says it was "morally reprehensible." #GOP divide on msg

Now GOP says Szubin is acting in the role already so not having a formal confirmation isn't a big deal. However, it's undermining to world

Szubin has been waiting over 200 days to be formally approved to the vital role. Was passed out of comt 14-8. So why hasnt he been approved?

The Obama Adm had through an order, barred federal contractors from discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Catholic schools don't screen for religion. Many schools gives discount to local parishioners in order to up enrollment/be community based.

Father Kasich, "When we help somebody else rise, it opens us up."
I believe so yes. Can't underestimate how well #GOP drew those districts. They OWN state houses post CitizensU https://t.co/buf3ptsQ98
@LPDonovan I meant Trump defeating demo odds. Cruz is fine. Per my read even if Mitch wanted to off him in a primary--hard. Ds cant W off yr
15. Lastly, if Trump got in and went full Warren Harding, when does a Rubio, a Kasich, anybody on #GOP side try to knock him off in primary?
14. Also on many occasions Ryan would have to say, "What President Trump meant...." What a position to be in!
13. Ryan would also have to move Trump's domestic policy through the Freedom Caucus. That won't be easy. Also a bill to build a wall
12. Now let's say Trump defies the odds &amp; pulls out a w. Speaker Ryan instantly becomes the most powerful person in DC. He is Trump's brain
@LukeRussert meant '17-'19 here. Wish there was an edit button...
@LPDonovan He won't lose his Speakership. He'll either retire to run for POTUS or he'll stay on the job.
Clarification on tweetstorm (7)  I meant '17-'19 not '13-'15. They all run together in politics.
11. So after an elex w Sanders and Trump showing people REALLY want to break up status quo. HRC w Speaker Ryan &amp; Leader Schumer = gridlock
10. He doesn't want to bring the party into another civil war, he punts.
9. Ryan could make a move on immigration, if he does not want to run for POTUS. He honestly wants to put issue behind the GOP. OR.....
8. I suspect Ryan blocks her. So therefore you will have '13-'15 be total trench warfare on the Hill and NOTHING will get done.
7. So from '13'-'15 Does Ryan cut a deal with President HRC? Or does he block her at every turn to preserve his conservative brand?
6. You can't be Speaker and run for POTUS. Too hard. Too much parliamentary responsibility.
5. Paul Ryan is the more interesting case. Does he want to run for POTUS? If he does want to run for POTUS, he needs to resign post 2018
4. Nevertheless, he will be a thorn in the side to Speaker Ryan, McConnell and even Trump if he somehow defeats the demographics odds.
3. However, if he stays in the Senate till 2020 he will have amassed a 8 year voting record which could hurt him in some capacity.
2. I think he would like to stay in the Senate because it gives him a position of power and a pulpit from which to whack the Establishment
1. There is absolutely no doubt that Cruz will run for POTUS again in 2020 if HRC wins, maybe even if Trump wins. Q is does he run for Sen?
