@billsdaily Not a chance. Reid is best QB coach in the league.
I just watched the Mahomes left handed throw for the 10th time on the DVR. Beyond Favre-ian.
@RealBryanWatson Yup and he‚Äôs probably our best player.
@seungminkim @frankthorp I spy my fat head!
Lots of #Bills fans/analysts come up in my feed reminding us that the Bills traded the Chiefs the pick used for Mahomes. Remember, Mahomes has Andy Reid-best QB coach in the NFL &amp; a üíØ supporting cast. Mahomes doesn‚Äôt do this in Buffalo.
@lifewithmikey52 And you know what-it makes for a more relaxing October.
These game 163s make me so happy inside. It‚Äôs baseball catnip. I‚Äôm going to read every single article about the pitching strategies for the division losers as they head into the Wild Card tomorrow. So many decisions!!!
@craigcalcaterra Yup. Folks are forgetting that the SCOTUS is special- these aren't normal standards, they're supposed to be extraordinary ones. I want dull untainted brilliantly smart people. Personality of an airline pilot with a brain of a surgeon. There's enough out there.

@nf_sabres_fan He had an affinity for the Miami rivalry. Liked the idea of the Fins coming to Buffalo in cold weather. I don‚Äôt begrudge him that, also liked the Bills as the only team with a NY stadium playing the ‚úàÔ∏è.
It probably won‚Äôt happen but I hope to live to see the day the #Bills move to the AFC North and the #Ravens go to the AFC East. Imagine a fully drivable AFC North? Would be so great. Pitt &amp; Cle rivalries so natural.

@MikeMadden White Flint to be honest.
Oh boy-Kavanaugh is going full angry belittled marginalized white man. Tough sell for today.
I‚Äôm terrified of small prop planes. I‚Äôd rather 8 hours on a 787 than 8 minutes on a Cessna. I‚Äôve flown them when I‚Äôve had to though I avoid them when I can. That has no bearing on my ability to tell the truth.

@LDCDee Absolutely. Of course I‚Äôd be content with a Congress of 100% women. Male ego games are a big part of the problem in Congress.
Many high profile law firms make their partners retire by 65-70. We got two 85 year olds in charge of the Judiciary Comt. I believe in senior wisdom but there‚Äôs a better way.
Watching these opening statements from octogenarians about an issue that aligns so much more strongly with younger generations makes me believe senators should be limited to four terms. Twenty-four years is enough time on the Hill.
@bone_dry_cuffs Thank God we're not in the playoff race. Ending the season with a 3 game set in a different time zone against a Rockies team fighting for their life.
Ok. Maybe they don‚Äôt call this game. 90% of the fans are leaving. So it‚Äôs over for most us.

@JAMES_BASE_ATP @rolandsmartin Fair point. I just feel claiming racism re the trial does two unfortunate things- 1. Reinforces the terrible stereotype in much of white America that AAs play race card over everything. 2. Undermines the victims, especially AA women who have long been marginalized by society.
@rolandsmartin Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but wasn‚Äôt Cosby criticized as a sellout to the race for the ‚ÄúPound Cake‚Äù speech?

@MomNyack True-just more pronounced this time around. Perhaps Josh Gordon is the savior.
Pats are always good with BB. Pats now have the same record as the #Bills. Brady looks uninterested, senile and angry. Has nothing around him. Reminds me of Kobe in the Byron Scott years.
@Vanhonker I‚Äôm all for due process. It‚Äôs overrated in SCOTUS. All SCOTUS judges should be squeaky clean Eagle Scouts. Congress and the WH can have the problem children.
@Adam__Wagner They have plenty of time. McConnell doesn‚Äôt care about process.
It‚Äôs just odd. McConnell is the Belichick of politics and in this case there are plenty of viable free agents that know the system and can plug the hole. No need to deal with this drama.
@mwgarb Correct. There are plenty of üíØ conservative judges who aren‚Äôt accused of sexual crimes.
@MikeSacksEsq @burgessev They sidelined Miers and moved to Alito fine. Seems like a lot of spilled blood for nothing. #OwnTheLibs #FakeNews !!!
@tickerguy 1. That‚Äôs a reach. 2. There‚Äôs plenty of qualified conservative women to have two female nominees and or they‚Äôre already the most qualified.
Maybe I‚Äôve been out of the game too long but why go to the mat so hard for Kavanaugh? Wouldn‚Äôt sidelining him and picking 46 year old Amy Coney Barrett be easier at this point? There‚Äôs enough white dudes from Prep on the SCOTUS.

Aside from devaluing real work, Kelly is also forgetting that for his cherished white immigrants, it often took 4-5 generations to get to the top, even in the ethnic strongholds of NYC-BOS-BAL-CHI-BUF-CLE-PITT etc. Please read a history book.
My grandpa, 2 &amp; 3 generations removed from Irish and German immigrants seeking economic opportunity, didn‚Äôt finish high school bc of that WWII thing. So only could get work as a garbage man &amp; truck driver. Raised 4 kids, including one who got a law degree &amp; became a journalist.

@JoeLATrib @SnowElfPaladin I‚Äôm out of journalism but if I ever go back rest assured I‚Äôll never shut up about this.
@SnowElfPaladin Think because of the energy and intensity of the Tea Party and how hardcore they were re spending in ‚Äò11, ‚Äò12, ‚Äò13 etc that it was more real this time. But you‚Äôre right, it was all a lie.
And now full Trumpanomics- deficit inducing tax cut + higher defense &amp; domestic spending. Seen this movie before. Onward.
167 House #GOP supported this bill. Many of them had knives out for Boehner when he was trying to do the bare minimum with divided government. Frauds.
It‚Äôs pretty remarkable that everything I covered on the Hill from 2011-2016 re spending &amp; budgets was completely meaningless. Leadership has totally gutted the Boehner spending reforms. Never get tricked again, #GOP only cares about deficits, debt &amp; spending when a D is POTUS. https://t.co/qo3R7fjchh

@DaveRowlen @EWErickson He‚Äôs a smart guy. He was tapped into the populist sentiment way before it was mainstream.
@EWErickson Where did Dems attack peaceful transfer of power?Mueller was appointed by a GOP DOJ after Sessions was comprised and Nunes of House Intel was compromised. It has led to former NSA advisor pleading guilty &amp; campaign chairman being charged. It should stop?
@EWErickson Erick you‚Äôre smarter than that. HRC conceded Weds AM. Obama had Trump into the Oval on Thurs. Never once did either say it was rigged or fraudulent something Trump has alluded to in the past for popular vote loss.
Reading about this bogus Roy Moore challenge, my biggest fear is that in 2020 a losing Trump actively attacks &amp; delegitimizes the peaceful transfer of power, the most positive and fragile enduring aspect of our democracy.

Our "friend" Saudi Arabia bred 15/19 9/11 hijackers, exports radical Wahhabism that led to ISIS and has an atrocious human rights record.
So we're back to Iran being the Great Satan and Saudi Arabia being our good natured well meaning friend. Forty more years of the same BS!

UNPRECEDENTED use of parliamentary procedure that won the #GOP two midterm elections and a SCOTUS seat. McConnell---brilliant tactician.
So today, think of what Obama could have done with 51 Senate voters 2009-2015. #GOP will nuke the filibuster for all bills eventually
Trump wins, chooses Gorsuch. Dems filibuster. McConnell laughs, he's been playing this game for yrs-He uses Dems '13 option to nuke current
Again, McConnell is Bill Belichick and incredible master of exploiting every possible outcome in order to win.
McConnell wisely stops the pick because he knows #GOP apprehensive towards Trump will pull the lever for him w a SCOTUS seat in the balance
Obama's pick Garland, can't even get a hearing. UNPRECEDENTED never seen in #USA history https://t.co/nqAt3U3WRM
So Scalia dies in Feb of '16, roughly a year left in Obama's term and McConnell says b4 Scalia's body is even cold that Obama make pic
The #GOP and Mitch McConnell are 1000% more hardcore than #Dems they bring AR-15s to dodgeball. They knew this gave them huge opening.
The #GOP was thrilled Reid went nuclear because it gave them the tools to do it in the future- l said in 2013 https://t.co/KpEOrQ9ZQD https://t.co/rFYd7q7gL9
Reid and others grow sick of this so they decide to "go nuclear" to push Obama's federal judges in 2013. They had no choice they say.
This then causes Obama and Dems to look inept at times and greatly helps GOP win 2010 midterms by casting Dems as dysfunctional
What's the approach? Use a parliamentary procedure known as the filibuster in a way that totally breaks from historic precedent
Obama comes into office in 2009, McConnell, the Bill Belichick of politics comes up with a novel way to stop him: https://t.co/p1ttL9kEfL

As trust further erodes in media due to the great equalization brought by tech, historians will point to speech as O calling it threat it is
Not a political speech at all. That was Obama's Ike Military Industrial Complex. Warning about "end of expertise" &amp; how it can end democracy
10. Don't know best way to combat this, but it sure as hell is not decrying every little thing on Twitter to the likeminded. See ya in '17
9. This is great news for elites &amp; for those who want to push an unchallenged agenda. Wool gets pulled further, only the military is trusted
8. So it's unlikely to change unless those who control cable/network/local TV &amp; FB can get past the car wreck bait. Not gonna happen
7. TV is a profit business not built to properly deal with the current reality. Twitter is really just an echo chamber for fellow believers
6. Absurdity has become normal and the more absurd, the more normal. In essence, reward comes to those who push the hyper absurd.
5. Kanye will get through because it cuts across racial, gender, age etc. Too easy for clicks, cable &amp; local news. Brilliant Trump.
4. I deleted Twitter App from my phone and it was greatest decision I ever made. For a month Ive see what actually gets through USA/World
3. TV programmers/producers can't say no to the easy low hanging fruit right in front of them. So out goes DT biz conflict, in comes Kanye
2. Now many smart journos have caught onto the scam, plead with their readers not to be hypnotized by the flashing lights. But it won't work
1. Remember, in media, "we're better than this" doesn't exist. Trump masterfully exploits this so Kanye happens on rough headline day for DT

Biden should call a mtg, get Brown, Casey, Baldwin, Stabenow &amp; Peters in a room. Go county by county, precinct by precinct. What happened?
Last night proved disruption is the new status quo, so no Dem should be thinking about "waiting their turn."
In the House, look at dynamic members like Jeffries, Kennedy, Gallego, Moulton &amp; Gabbard. Can they have a seat at the table?
#Dems to watch Brown, Warren, Booker, Murphy &amp; Klobuchar. Look at Masto in NV. Then what did Roy Cooper do right in NC?
Dem I really respect told me this AM, party is too close to Wall St, focused on social issues at expense of poverty &amp; not dynamic on Hill
Where do #Dems go now? They killed off Blue Dogs for a law that hurt them for 4 elexs. Obama coalition only there for O.
Do House Democrats return Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn to their Leadership posts? Or do #Dems young guns make their move?

McCarthy tells me House Ds floor protest was "not a behavior becoming of the U.S. Congress" says #GOP Leadership won't tolerate it in future
Leader McCarthy calls FBI report on HRC email usage, "very troubling" "terrible judgment" worried that bar is set now for others to violate
What's remarkable after that Comey presser, is that the #GOP nominated the only person that can't make "judgment" a campaign issue.
With the Clintons it always comes down to judgment. 4 days of news-Bill meets w AG Lynch on a plane, FBI director excoriates her email usage
Shorter Comey: HRC knowingly used personal email for classified info,alarmingly careless &amp; reckless, used terrible judgement. BUT no charges
Comey: Our judgment, "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case" against HRC re emails.
Comey: It is possible hostile actors gained access to HRC email account
Shorter Comey: A Secretary of State should not have been this careless and reckless.
Comey: HRC &amp; team "extremely careless" in their handling of classified information
Comey: No evidence work related emails were intentionally deleted
Comey: 110 personal emails in 52 chains classified. 8 top secret. 36 secret. 8 confidential.

Here ends the reading.
10) Lastly, this has ALWAYS been political. From its formation (Boehner red meat to base) to it's release (19 days b4 #GOP convention).
9) Did it prove Hillary was in anyway responsible for 4 American deaths in Benghazi? Absolutely not. Nobody directly was. Fault all around
8) So yes Benghazi Comt did do something for the #GOP, it exposed Hillary's private email server, if there's a "smoking gun" that was it
7) All the questions about trust re Hillary, re shady practices at STATE, all goes back to that private email account.
6) BUT, what #Benghazi did was give the #GOP a fighting chance in this general, and if it wasn't for Trump, maybe an edge.
5) SO, you can re-litigate #Benghazi 10x over, Lord knows now 8 comts have tried. People will believe what their political interests are
4) So essentially Boehner ordering the investigation is what shed light on Clinton's email and her highly questionable setup
3) Nevertheless, if there is no #Benghazi Comt it's unclear if Hillary Clinton's private email setup ever comes to light.
2) Boehner relented after some new WH emails surfaced but in actuality he had to throw red meat to the base who were calling for his head
1) Boehner was reluctant to name it bc he thought it cld turn into a witch hunt and backfire, also 7 other comts had not found "smoking gun"

@jbarro @mmurraypolitics #Dems bench is very strong in MA. They should win the seat, no Coakley problem. Big bet though.
I used to think Warren was more valuable in Senate, but think it's worth risk of Senate seat. Got to think Deval, JK3, Moulton can win MA
If u believe u win w your base turning out, then there really is no other option for #Dems than Warren as VP. Most energy at HRC rally ever

Szubin has been waiting over 200 days to be formally approved to the vital role. Was passed out of comt 14-8. So why hasnt he been approved?

As they understand it, Ryan has concerns regarding Trump's view of the executive branch, wants Trump to know Congress is equal partner

Catholic schools historically have been open, many of the oldest continue serve mainly non-Catholic communities in impoverished areas.
If you've followed Catholic education recently, the problem has been school closings, especially in economically distressed areas.
Catholic schools don't screen for religion. Many schools gives discount to local parishioners in order to up enrollment/be community based.

@LPDonovan I meant Trump defeating demo odds. Cruz is fine. Per my read even if Mitch wanted to off him in a primary--hard. Ds cant W off yr
15. Lastly, if Trump got in and went full Warren Harding, when does a Rubio, a Kasich, anybody on #GOP side try to knock him off in primary?
14. Also on many occasions Ryan would have to say, "What President Trump meant...." What a position to be in!
13. Ryan would also have to move Trump's domestic policy through the Freedom Caucus. That won't be easy. Also a bill to build a wall
12. Now let's say Trump defies the odds &amp; pulls out a w. Speaker Ryan instantly becomes the most powerful person in DC. He is Trump's brain
@LukeRussert meant '17-'19 here. Wish there was an edit button...
@LPDonovan He won't lose his Speakership. He'll either retire to run for POTUS or he'll stay on the job.
Clarification on tweetstorm (7)  I meant '17-'19 not '13-'15. They all run together in politics.
11. So after an elex w Sanders and Trump showing people REALLY want to break up status quo. HRC w Speaker Ryan &amp; Leader Schumer = gridlock
10. He doesn't want to bring the party into another civil war, he punts.
9. Ryan could make a move on immigration, if he does not want to run for POTUS. He honestly wants to put issue behind the GOP. OR.....
8. I suspect Ryan blocks her. So therefore you will have '13-'15 be total trench warfare on the Hill and NOTHING will get done.
7. So from '13'-'15 Does Ryan cut a deal with President HRC? Or does he block her at every turn to preserve his conservative brand?
6. You can't be Speaker and run for POTUS. Too hard. Too much parliamentary responsibility.
5. Paul Ryan is the more interesting case. Does he want to run for POTUS? If he does want to run for POTUS, he needs to resign post 2018
4. Nevertheless, he will be a thorn in the side to Speaker Ryan, McConnell and even Trump if he somehow defeats the demographics odds.
3. However, if he stays in the Senate till 2020 he will have amassed a 8 year voting record which could hurt him in some capacity.
2. I think he would like to stay in the Senate because it gives him a position of power and a pulpit from which to whack the Establishment
1. There is absolutely no doubt that Cruz will run for POTUS again in 2020 if HRC wins, maybe even if Trump wins. Q is does he run for Sen?

More great Boehner nuggets---Kasich is a needy friend, he texts with Trump, would vote for him but never for Cruz https://t.co/D0TTCGSilk
Boehner calls Cruz, "Lucifer in the flesh" &amp; "I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life" https://t.co/D0TTCGSilk

@jennifercarolyn I think he's a wonderful personality and the clubhouse mood has never been better but this deeply concerns me.
Third game in a row Dusty is leaving his starter in game post 100 pitches and starter getting into a jam. #Nats
Bobby Knight says that historians will equate Trump voters with the Founding Fathers.
Bobby Knight puts Harry Truman in top 3 presidents of all time-----------that's a stretch
"You folks are looking at the most prepared man in history to be President of the United States." Bobby Knight on Donald Trump

Hey @THEREALSWIZZZ can you remix this? https://t.co/KSgmYeWuwx
So per Carly, Ted Cruz likes to gamble on sports.
I hope Trump sings at his next event

Always loved this pic, RFK then the hatchet man for JFK, saying through his expression "win us the South &amp; shut up" https://t.co/Naob4CoZgE
@DeMathaCatholic It's St. Albans---no apostrophe.
Reminder that Ted Cruz's VP pick dropped the most insane political ad of all time back in 2010 https://t.co/q1s95hqSsf üòàüêë #DemonSheep
Gtown student asks Ryan if #GOP's eventual healthcare plan will protect people w preexisting conditions? Ryan says gov shld fund risk pools
@shundle long long long answer about why America needs to have competitive corporate tax rates
Ryan says he won't move on immigration with Obama due to "executive amnesty." Opportunity will have to wait till next president.
Gtown student asks Ryan why he should vote #GOP when AZ &amp; KS are run on all of Ryan's ideas and are having significant problems-- #RyanAtGU
Ryan re 2016-- #GOP loses personality contests all the time, we always do, but we can win an ideas contest. #RyanAtGU
Ryan's answer---"Look at the policies, not the person." #GOP 2016
Great Q to Ryan from Gtown #GOP student---I don't like Cruz or Trump---why should I be excited about this election? #RyanAtGU
Ryan tells Gtown students he was wrong to use terms, "makers and takers." Says best to "own up" to mistakes. #RyanAtGU
Ryan says he supports removing Mississippi flag from Capitol hallway, supports Haley removing Confederate flag from SC Capitol
Hmmm-Ryan gets a Q from Gtown student about Northern #GOP's "reconstruction" of the South re removing Mississippi flag from Capitol hallway
Speaker Ryan: instead of locking people up, why don't we unlock their potential? --re #USA incarceration rate #RyanAtGU
Speaker Ryan: The Democrats we battle with every day, are good people who love our country. #RyanAtGU
@FoxReports Justin Trudeau made the ski bum to politics jump quite successfully
Ryan's mom talked him out of it, said he a ski bum till 30. So he chose politics. #RyanAtGU
Speaker Ryan tells Georgetown student that he originally planned to be a mountain climber/ski patrol guy in Colorado after college.
Ryan's opening line at @GUPolitics town hall, "Why support Republicans?" Crowd politely laughs. #RyanAtGU https://t.co/tv3NjCbN1e
"We have to learn to disagree with each other in ways that allow us to work for the common good,‚Äù Jenkins said. https://t.co/aOkB5hsaLZ
The Knight endorsement of Trump got me thinking---how good would a @JFeinsteinBooks "Campaign on the Brink" re Trump be?!?
What could be difficult optics for Ryan, Senate #GOP passes standalone #ZikaVirus bill that WH supports and it lingers in House.
Speaker Ryan tells me "no options have been foreclosed upon" re #ZikaVirus --Senate seems ready to move stand alone legislation to combat
Within reach.  https://t.co/HSibDIZe6W

In other news, why did Dusty let Scherzer pitch the 6th and why's he still in the game!? #Nats
@JWGOP right, you'd think it spur movement on behalf of your guy or at least restructuring of the doctrine where JK isn't considered a RINO.
What do Reince, Ryan &amp; McConnell think---a guy overwhelmingly won NH, MA, CT, RI, NY &amp; AL, MS, SC, FL running totally against their #GOP
Trump's W in CT not unexpected but what a statement. A wealthier and more educated state. Far from the "I love the poorly educated" post NV
I'm skeptical of the lineup behind Cruz idea. Per my convos w R members, so many took so much incoming due to Cruz in '13, grudge lives
Covering Congress I can tell u Cruz is a uniter, his colleagues both R and D are united in their dislike of him. https://t.co/yNLCAyjqCD
Per that answer, WH keeps door open to sending military forces in an advisory role to Libya/other parts of Africa to combat ISIS
The @PressSec tells me he's not aware of "any geographic limitations" on sending a force of advisors, like 250 sent to Syria to combat ISIS
So the vulnerable Toomey seems more comfortable with Cruz at the top of the ticket in PA. Interesting. https://t.co/UeL3i0heNs
