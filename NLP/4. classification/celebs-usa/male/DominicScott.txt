@Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess The issue I had was with it being stated as a fact to the shutdown. Also the parks, from what I read were not affected with destruction from previous shutdowns. Seems it's a coincidence or just people being terrible.
@apurelightx @Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess Having any affect doesn't disregard what I said. What I said is the truth. You can't base what one person saw as a fact to the shutdown when they don't even know.
@Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess I’ll wait until there’s a report based on crime during this shutdown. I don’t negate that there could be crime but I have an issue with people making what they saw as a literal fact to the shutdown. There’s no proof and they have no clue. It’s hearsay.
@saintdeyves @tribecalledess Because it’s a problem when people base what they saw as fact when it’s not fact. This is harmful in many situations.
@supermariobruhh @tribecalledess I’m pretty sure none of these are afffected by the shutdown as of yet.
@RavenK_ @Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess It does but the issue I have is this person is clarifying that the “thefts they saw” are based on the government being shut down when this is most likely not true.
@Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess These are not based on the shut down.
@cuckoo_for_coco @Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess Yes, she’s using her experience to blame the shut down without any proof. It’s a problem. If you’re going to make accusations you need proof to back it up.
@Zeroeshima Then what’s the point of this tweet?
@Melljoee @TrinityforHire @tribecalledess It’s a literal exaggeration until it’s statistically proven which this will never be because y’all love to exaggerate. 😌

@BADf3minist @sbstryker @rjh1290 The white does not jump out considering y’all white gays attack any POC you possibly can. Sad.
@BADf3minist @sbstryker @rjh1290 I said I don’t care if he apologized you fucking imbecile.
@BADf3minist @sbstryker @rjh1290 Are you drunk?
@BADf3minist @sbstryker @rjh1290 Lol bitch. These issues are from years ago and hold no barring now. The real issues are in front of your face and you’re lacking enough intelligence to realize it. 😂😌
@sbstryker @rjh1290 Imagine if people made this much noise about people dying in Chechnya. Y’all care about the wrong shit. Wake up.
@sbstryker @rjh1290 Quite frankly I don’t care if someone apologizes for something they said years ago. It makes no difference. It literally does nothing. There is no impact.
@_TheCoalTiger @sbstryker wait lmfao https://t.co/5gF24Zta4H
@sbstryker Also while you’re at it maybe add some diversity to your Instagram. Looks like you’re another white gay offended and attacking a POC for ....do I really need to say it? https://t.co/faaC97Oy5b
@sbstryker Acting like you’re offended is hilarious. You’re not. You’re using it as an excuse to attack someone who made comments how long ago? And is also a comedian? Go rant about issues that actually matter in the community. This does not.
@sbstryker Grow the hell up and realize people grow with age. Knowledge isn’t something you’re born with and the fact that you’re holding someone to a higher standard than yourself is fucking sad. Great way to go into 2019!
@sbstryker The funny thing is you’re not actually offended. You’re using it as a scapegoat to take down somebody for something they said YEARS ago. Who the fuck cares if he apologized or not? It’s not going to make you feel any different than you do in this very instant. It’s sad.

@AskeBay Thanks. Will send info to her.
@AskeBay Yes, so I asked how she can contact you and you sent a general number which was talked to 10x and was no literal help.
@AskeBay This freaking link you sent is the same thing we've done a million times. Talked to your outsourced resolution team with zero lack of intelligence.
@AskeBay An appeal may not be determined and she has to be pay shipping because you guys are biased to the buyer. Even though the item works and they claimed it was defective? Because that's the entire conversation I had with your resolution team.
@AskeBay Only way she has to contact you is by calling &amp; we get the same people in resolutions. What's the number she can call? How can the item be defective if there's a serial # on it and we can provide a video with the serial showing it working? Your team couldn't comprehend that.
@AskeBay Every person she talks to on the phone is a fucking idiot. They said since the buyer said it was defective that it is defective and video proof is nothing and that you guys always side with the BUYER. It's outrageous.
@AskeBay @ebay What the hell? My mom sold an iPod on your service and it WORKS, you guys auto approved a return and she gets it back and it STILL WORKS. Even though they said it didn't. You guys won't refund the shipping/return shipping &amp; say here's a coupon. No. Fix this.

@BestInTheGalaxy @ElliWalden @THR The article was updated and @THR for whatever reason doesn't include revisions. Here's the cached google version. https://t.co/zy5X2IElf7
@ElliWalden @THR If my response about next of kin not being notified is in relation to a Hollywood Reporter article and the tweet was in response to that AND that's something you can't comprehend, go back to school.
@ElliWalden @THR I read the fucking article you dimwit.
dear gay twitter,  if justin timberlake doesn't bring out janet we're rioting and causing havoc on the straights. spread the word
@ElliWalden @THR How about read the article next time before opening your mouth? The article states they have not been notified hence my comment.
@ElliWalden @THR There's a difference. You act like I'm giving sympathy to him.
@PeeWeeInATeePee @mriaframirez @THR No one is victimizing the innocent.
@Im_Vinnie @THR Learn to read, honey!
@mriaframirez @THR I wouldn't too, but any sane person has compassion for their son/brother regardless of what anyone wants to admit. Finding out someone died via media is a shitty feeling for them. It doesn't affect him because he's literally dead. I don't care about this fool.
@AngstAttack @THR That's why I said it shouldn't be posted until next of kin has been notified. One every so often still isn't okay.
@Im_Vinnie @THR Never said I felt sorry for him, but thanks for putting the words in my mouth!
@AngstAttack @THR Did you bother to read the article?
@THR Imagine being the family and finding out your son/brother has died via the internet/tv. Media outlets should at least have the respect to wait until next of kin have been notified, regardless of how shitty the person is. It affects family, not him.

@NONAMERlO I'm tired of people like you clogging the $ltc as if you have any knowledge whatsoever. Just do us a favor and shut up.
@NONAMERlO I wouldn't understand, lol? You compared $300 to $1,000 and said it was over. You're stupid, shut up.
@NONAMERlO Your logic is stupid.
@MailChimp Thanks! #3171681

@lemur_catta Other people's business becomes mine when it clogs my feed. Constant need to report to people about what they're doing, especially in a romantic standpoint is insecure. I don't want to see it.
I just watched 8 Instagram stories where people are videoing their date night tonight. Why are you videoing your date night instead of being in the moment with the person you apparently love/into? Why are you seeking validation from the Internet by posting this shit?

@KylieJenner ur not terror jr????? im pissed
@watormelon wait omg i forgot about this show
@AskeBay The post office keeps saying no updates so I'm literally screwed. The tracking hasn't been updated since 10/27. The guy did a dispute WHILE the package said out for delivery and at the end of the day, it changed to unavailable. Something is fishy.
I HATE WHEN NETFLIX PUTS CANCELLED SHOWS ON THEIR SERVICE AND THEN I BINGE WATCH THEM AND GO TO GOOGLE SEASON TWO AND FIND OUT ITS CANCELLED AND ILL NEVER KNOW WTF HAPPENS AFTER THE CLIFFHANGER AND HOW I JUST EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED MYSELF TO A SHOW FOR 12 HOURS https://t.co/v7CWRWRh6s
@BofA_Help Yes. I’ll dm info.
@AskeBay Keep communication through eBay? The guy won’t respond on eBay so I asked you guys to step in and you automatically put the dispute in his favor.
men are literally so needy and clingy
@kingsleyyy i'm gonna leak the demo i have of u singing on my computer unless u bring me in n out rn
@AskeBay @AskPayPal He hasn't responded to one message nor in the dispute. eBay closed the dispute and refunded him the money and now he has the camera. eBay said to file a police report. I don't want to do that, but will if necessary. Is it possible to get my funds other than doing that? (2/2)
@AskeBay @AskPayPal A guy opened a dispute on eBay saying he didn't get a camera I sold him. He emailed me confirming he received it but won't respond on eBay. Tracking weirdly stopped updating so it doesn't say delivered, it says unavailable. (1/2)

@Clt_VoyagesSncf @SNCF Yeah your freaking site has NO USA option for global pass. I had to put I live in fucking Italy to get a damn ticket
it's not even noon and I've already screamed at 10 people for stopping in front of me instead of MOVING TO THE FUCKING SIDE
@SNCF I have a global pass but for some reason your website is ridiculously impossible to use. Your app has no reservation options either
@SNCF NO ONE is picking up your phones and why can't I make a seat reservation on your website? Where's the US country selection in billing?
@raileurope your website is fucking crap

Adding excuse to why a person treats you like shit makes it okay. They continue doing it because YOU made it okay. Don't add to the problem.
Don't accept less than what you're worth. And you are worth a lot.
This is bullshit. YOU don't HAVE to do anything. Don't make it okay for a guy to treat you like shit. Don't accept it. Don't wait on it. https://t.co/3oAUe9BkP0

@HPSupport Y'all couldn't tell me anything other than take it to a service provider where I have to pay to have it fixed although it's a common issue.
@IzBAWLZ lol no.
this generation is gonna be 80 years old crying over a stupid boy because they went on a date and thought they were in a relationship
if y'all went on two dates, ur not dating. ur not in a relationship. y'all went on two dates. same with three dates. understand that.
apparently a lot of people don't understand the difference between dating and in a relationship &amp; that's why they're whining on social media
there's a squirrel sitting outside my window taunting my cat and honestly that's my petty ass being reincarnated into a squirrel

@katyslights @jordeloc @jermlikespie No she didn't. Focus was scrapped from DW and only included on Japan. And it was released Oct '15 and Dangerous Woman was March '16.
@Purposefulp0p @matruelov @jordeloc @jermlikespie Someone said it may be a tour announcement and not a song, which would make sense. They don't drop songs on Monday's anymore.
@Purposefulp0p @matruelov @jordeloc @jermlikespie I frankly dgaf if they're a promo single or not. But her team is fucking her stuff up. I love Katy but she needs a new team.
@Purposefulp0p @matruelov @jordeloc @jermlikespie Doesn't mean it's a promo single. Rihanna's songs weren't promo singles even tho they were a year from Anti and not included. Same thing.
@KevinKerry69 @katyperry T H A N K Y O U. I like the song but it's not the correct time.
@Purposefulp0p @matruelov @jordeloc @jermlikespie Where's this at?
@matruelov @jordeloc @jermlikespie I HOPE it is.
@itstheweezy @katyperry Not rude. It's the truth. She needs a new camp because they're doing her wrong.
@jordeloc @jermlikespie Whoops FourFive wasn't a promo, but they weren't released right after each other.
@jordeloc @jermlikespie What? Lmfao. Chained was Feb. FourFiveSeonds was a promo in Jan. BBHMM was March.
@jermlikespie Didn't know anyone did. I only see half of my replies unless I search my name.
@jordeloc @jermlikespie If she did say it's a promo single, they're lying to cover their ass.
@jordeloc @jermlikespie As if. You don't drop a promo video for a promo single and then drop the official song a business day later. It confuses the GP.
@jermlikespie Agreed.
@jermlikespie Witness is probably only a promo single, but to release it basically a day after the official singles video drop is weird.
@jermlikespie Roar was Aug, Unconditionally Oct, Dark Horse Dec. This era is already a mess. #JusticeForDoubleRainbow
@katyperry Are you seriously rush releasing a leaked song because the other flopped? This won't work. Get a new camp.

my moisturizer is lost in the mail and I'm literally getting uglier by the second 😭
@kristiemacris Considering the companion ticket is only $99 😂
@kristiemacris Help your poor soul.
@kristiemacris The Alaska card IS literally crap rewards. Like stop. You look so stupid.
@kristiemacris I use the rewards. I don't like lounges. I don't use the companion code because I have hundreds of thousands of points. 🙄
@kristiemacris I was informing/show you facts rather than trying to argue with you. Because in retrospect, Virgin IS better than Alaska.
@kristiemacris No point. I'm literally just comparing international/available cities. Alaska's card in reality is crap. Barclay is the best.
@kristiemacris A reward based system will never compete with an actual dollar amount. Doesn't matter where. It's common knowledge.
@kristiemacris I compared Alaska's miles for a flight to JFK and also Virgin. Virgin was half off. Like stop.
@kristiemacris First class for 120k points for two people to Paris from Seattle is also a joke. Not true.
@kristiemacris The reality of 20k international flights on America is laughable. It's not even remotely true.
@kristiemacris You completely disregarded where I said Virgin and Barclay use dollar value rather than the reward value. And then you threw out false info.
@kristiemacris I'm not at all. It's you saying other reward systems have better point values. That's all. They don't.
@kristiemacris Probably forgot.
@kristiemacris Wanna go back to the tweets where you claim the rewards are better via other airlines or did you magically forget that?
@kristiemacris I was nice until you were consistently ignorant as hell. 😘
@kristiemacris 😂 god I feel bad for the person who marries your stupid ass.
@kristiemacris Which is why I mentioned Barclay Elite because you can use it with any airline and it's the only one I know with dollar value + 10% back
@kristiemacris I explained countless times the rewards are far superior. But you're too stubborn to realize.
@USPSHelp pls check direct message
@kristiemacris I mentioned Barclay a dozen times? Obviously I mention Virgin because it's their card. I didn't mention Comenity until you did.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir + seats aren't comfy unless you're in first class, which I'd never waste points on and a clean bathroom is expected.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir Eh, lot of meaning. Hence why I know which airline gets you the most bang for your buck. Don't be so stubborn, won't get you far.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir BTW - look at Alaska up-charging for the same flight, same day. @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir https://t.co/ASGitOO7ce
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir Don't come at me with fake facts like a Trump supporter. https://t.co/FbobyjUEPC
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir Each way. https://t.co/ZPsmtCL1ai
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir Why don't you actually look up the flights? Plus when I go to that list and click US to Europe it automatically redirects me to booking.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir And once again, they use an outdated old school reward system where your miles aren't dollar value. They're reward value.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir .........American? Said no one ever. They're one of the most expensive. I even just looked and it's 47.5k each way for a ticket to Germany.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir The only card I've found similar to Virgins is the Barclay which you can use any airline + 10% miles back upon redemption
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir 34k points + standard fees on Virgin or 65k + fees up to 300 each way on Alaska
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @AlaskaAir It's a general statement. But LAX to Germany on Alaska is still 65k + looks like more expensive fees. LAX to JFK is 12-14k if you time right
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch Amex shut off my card and demanded to "know where my money is coming from" so I stopped with them. https://t.co/MJRDsipTjz
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @askcomenity I use the reward points like no other. I don't use lounges (too pretentious imo) or companion because I always have miles.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @askcomenity Also I've been with the Virgin Card since they were at Barclay 🤔 - always been automatic for me.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @askcomenity It should always be automatic and if it's not then you need to look into a class action lawsuit. I've never had an issue with any of this.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @askcomenity No it doesn't because I'm logged in on my tablet, phone and laptop all the time. lol.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica @askcomenity Mine always comes, just got it actually - but I never use it. ¯\(ツ)/¯
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica First class? Girl, no. I've looked at Alaska's schedule by month and the cheapest is 27.5k one way on coach.
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica That's 60k each lol.
@essayareayaitch @kristiemacris @VirginAmerica @askcomenity I mean honestly, I wouldn't be pissed at a card company over a luggage fee. There's bigger issues to get pissed about imo.
@essayareayaitch @kristiemacris @VirginAmerica @askcomenity You're initially charged and then they usually credit your card end of statement or next statement.
@ChristineLai604 @USPS It's the only one I like! Highly recommend
@essayareayaitch @kristiemacris @VirginAmerica @askcomenity Yeah, literally never had an issue and I like to complain. 😂
@essayareayaitch @kristiemacris @VirginAmerica Using an old school rewards system is outdated, @AlaskaAir. If you want a good card, Barclay World Elite it is.
@essayareayaitch @kristiemacris @VirginAmerica I've never had an issue. Virgin is a 149 companion vs. Alaska's 99. Round trip NYC to Germany is 20k pts. Alaska is 65k. 😂
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica can charge you whatever the hell they want while Virgin charges by the actual dollar of the flight. FYI
@kristiemacris @essayareayaitch @VirginAmerica The cards actually 100x worse. Alaska uses reward tiers for their points while Virgin uses actual dollar amounts. Basically Alaska

@CorSomething yeah, because not speaking about something does something.
The sad thing is these grown adults with daughters voted for a man who said you can sexually assault anyone if you're rich/famous.
If I wanna rant for the next four fucking years, I'm gonna rant for the next four fucking years. Unfollow me if you don't wanna hear it.
Curiosity didn't kill the cat. Oblivion did.
When you live in your own fairytale world, reality is hard to fathom. Which basically means most rich privileged white people are morons.
There's a reason Donald Trump chose Pence aka one the most hateful and disgusting humans.
Trump supporters use the excuse that Hillary supporters teach hate. But Trump's entire campaign was based off hate. That's the irony.

is paris hilton old enough to become president? can california break off? fuck. make california fabulous and let us peace out.
@EnEmKay__ he's a fucking moron.
AMERICA 2016 = RAPE CULTURE, MISOGYNY, HOMOPHOBIA, RACISM, POLICE BRUTALITY
The SAME people that blame Hillary for Bill cheating are ALSO the same people who say, "well... she was wearing a short skirt!"
People blame Hillary for Bill Clinton cheating on her. That seriously drives me wild. You're blaming a woman... for her HUSBANDS ACTIONS?
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK OUT OF HERE. You don't blame a woman for FORGIVING their HUSBAND. Stop victim blaming you piece of fucking shit! https://t.co/f0r9u1h0yh
Everyone's going to look back on this election 100 years from now and y'all Trump supporters are gonna look like Nazis. You are Nazis.
OF COURSE gay conversion therapy isn't going to happen, but the fact that people voted for someone who WANTS it to happen.
14% of Donald's votes were apparently LGBT. Might as well let me strap you into that chair and let me electrocute your stupid ass.
i'm sitting here on my couch just thinking of all these women that support trump and i laugh. i literally laugh. because it's insane. lol.
LGBT 4 Trump is INSANE. Donald Trump is not going to do A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G for trans rights.
you women that support trump are literally bat shit fucking insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!
there's an actual recording of donald trump saying, "grab em by the pussy. you can do anything" and these WOMEN don't care. that is CRAZY!
it blows my mind that people are so fucking stupid to see facts.
another reason politics end friendships is because a person votes for a misogynistic racist who thinks they can sexually assault women
reason politics end friendships is usually because, you know, one person votes for a candidate who has a vp who wants to electrocute gays
@ChrisAStewart_ @TehBhav it's real. https://t.co/5xeWFhnFRm
@Timmacdawg @realDonaldTrump actually hillary had the most votes so the people want hillary. trump won electoral.

@masterkeight yup
Straight privileged white men all over the US think tax cuts = happiness.
The tax cuts don't even matter to LGBTQ because it's not like Pence is gonna allow us to use that money to adopt anyway.

people don't care about emails. they don't want a woman president. they want a racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic president.
the sad thing is people voted for a man who's endorsed by the kkk and republicans just bitched about some emails.
well. at least. like. you know. things. could. be. worse? maybe? like who needs rights anyway?

@Mirrrr_ https://t.co/82aSI1YiHY

@domarotti @PokemonGoApp oh, give it time.
@NickRepairsPCs @PokemonGoApp that's not how running a company works. Hence why their rating went from 4 to 1.

@JonathanWong15 @TheFifthLegend you can add Nexon and Riot to that as well.
@sylschinco aware, but should have been hired far before the game came out.
@Seiyorah @TheFifthLegend even Britney Spears mobile game offered compensation. 🙄
@TheFifthLegend @CoreyLay you obviously don't play video games.
@TheFifthLegend LOL what video game company doesn't? @CoreyLay
@TheFifthLegend @PokemonGoApp any other company would have responded within 24 hours and given compensation or at least an apology.
@KisskerVenwrath @PokemonGoApp true. or could just read Reddit. https://t.co/muoNjNIJkp
@PolarToffee @PokemonGoApp agreed.
@Tsheevrit @PokemonGoApp I am. But it's still a shit show.
@Karim_1400 @PolarToffee @PokemonGoApp incorrect.
@PolarToffee @PokemonGoApp takes 2 mins to construct a 140 tweet acknowledging a bug. They obviously weren't experienced enough to handle.
@PolarToffee @PokemonGoApp Regardless, should have been hired before than now. Numerous other bugs they haven't even commented on.
@PolarToffee @PokemonGoApp and the current CM tweeted that they hadn't hired an individual person for Go. So shut the fuck up.
@PolarToffee @PokemonGoApp everyone knew about them the day the game was updated which was almost a week ago? If not over?
@PokemonGoApp this has been going on for how long and you're just now commenting on it? pay for a community team rather than ads.

Excuse you? BLM have done NOTHING wrong. There is no justice. This is what happens when THERE IS NO JUSTICE. https://t.co/znrJN0NXt6
If you are JUSTIFYING these cops, YOU. ARE. THE. FUCKING. PROBLEM.
I am upset, outraged and appalled that people are justifying cops actions for killing these people who did absolutely nothing to deserve it.
These ignorant fucks love to talk "statistics" but when actual statistics are thrown in their face they run away like cowards.
@Briandite no cunt you're just ignorant AF
@tizzod2 elaborate
Stop living in your pretty white world and come to reality. We need action for what the fuck is going on in this sick twisted world.
@Briandite The population of black people is 13% percent if YOU REALLY want to talk statistics.

@MorgannRenae @TylerTrieber you guys should stop being so fucking ignorant living in your pretty white world.
@MorgannRenae @TylerTrieber the ONLY reason the media is reporting the last few cases is because there's VIDEO
@MorgannRenae @TylerTrieber HOW?
@TylerTrieber she got pulled over for a tail light and they KILLED her and said she committed suicide
@TylerTrieber look up Sandra bland case. it's FUCKED
@TylerTrieber plus there's valid proof of these people doing NOTHING to deserve death and NOTHING is being done about it
@TylerTrieber when the black population is 13% and the rates of unarmed black killings by cops is 37% that doesn't make sense.
@TylerTrieber racist ass white people are sitting here saying all lives matter which is TRUE. but it doesn't matter right now.
@TylerTrieber no. you're dismissing the facts. of course there SHOULDNT be race but it's prevalent and exists.
It is IGNORANT and RACIST to bring up black on black crime in response to a white cop murdering a black man for sitting in his damn car.
@kittygalore6 more important if people don't own one. want self defense? go to boxing.
@kittygalore6 and most people who own a gun don't even know how to use it properly.

@kittygalore6 wtf. no?
@kittygalore6 FALSE.

@TylerTrieber 🙄
@TylerTrieber it's not even about politics. did you even watch the videos?! 🙄
these people preaching about how they need guns is so beyond. chances are you don't own a gun &amp; if you do, you haven't used it nor know how.
you're disgusting  https://t.co/NrHzky9Eab

@johnewalsh @Lowes because they can't even understand the difference between a washer and a dryer (even though I said washer 15 times).
@Lowes especially since the fuck up is internally with your employees.
@Lowes ridiculous. At least Home Depot can get shit done in seconds if there's a fuck up.
@Lowes so what's going to happen? This is a waste of my time. And my money.
@Lowes I wasted 30 mins of my time and you can clearly listen to the recording with the specialist where I say washer about 15 times.
@Lowes are you guys going to fix this and get me someone out today? My contractor is waiting.
@Lowes and now no one can come fix my washer today and I've been on the phone for almost 30 mins again aka you guys wasting my time?
@Lowes I was on the phone w/ service yesterday for 30 mins to have someone come fix my broken washer &amp; apparently u put down the dryer?

@tarv28 yes, agreed.
@The__Unbeliever no it won't. It'll dramatically increase costs of most things &amp; then ppl will need more $. It'll also bankrupt small biz's
raising min wage to $15 an hour will increase costs across the entire US aka not really solving anything.
