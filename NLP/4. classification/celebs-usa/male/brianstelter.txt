I just spoke with Univision's @jczamora. He said Maduro "stopped the interview" with @JorgeRamosNews this evening. "Jorge managed to call us" while the crew was being detained, "and in the middle of the call, they took his phone away," Zamora said.

@soledadobrien i'm not trying to offer a "take." i'm trying to report on the hiring and the controversy, which is what i think twitter needs more of -- reporting!
@marybschneider @CNNPR please see my earlier tweet. she will have one of many seats at the table, reporting up to the political director.

@alexapagliuca i respect your POV but i'm not an "analyst" or a defender, i'm a reporter. so i'm reporting. don't you want more of that in the world?
@Pschlarm just checking, am i the "waterlogged bologna sculpture?" i get the waterlogged part, but what is a "bologna structure?"
@Smartypants60 You have views, so do your colleagues, it all informs the coverage... as you know! Here's the example I always cite: My mentor used to say that because he and I went to state schools, we brought a different viewpoint to the Ivy-grad-heavy NYT newsroom.
"GOP operative joins CNN" is getting a LOT of criticism, especially from Dems. But love it or hate it, political insiders have been joining newsrooms for decades. The more viewpoints represented in newsrooms, the better. As for the critiques, @CNNPR declined to comment.
I asked @CNNPR for more details on this. @WhigNewtons will report to political director @DavidChalian. She's joining a group of several political editors who coordinate coverage, which entails managing teams in the field / sending out news alerts internally / etc. https://t.co/UQ94b3nUMM

@ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN arthur, did you actually watch our coverage last night? i brought up smollett's "MAGA" allegation in the first 3 minutes of our breaking news coverage. i've been doing live shots again this morning and talking about it some more.

Heather Nauert is not expected to return to her State Dept spokesman job, a source tells @jamiegangel.
@RonColeman Did you watch the video? I didn't say anything close to what he's claiming.
@bradcooney1 @Harlan I hear you, but I think you left out a few words. "The media" is a term containing everything from TMZ to Foreign Affairs to "Empire" to your favorite radio station. "Some in the media," mostly low quality outlets and partisan/celebrity figures, rushed to judgment in this case.
@Harlan Harlan, I didn't say anything about "blame" or "conservatives." I never even used those words. I think Hollywood activists, among others, "weaponized" the allegations. Why are you spreading B.S. to your followers?
Heather Nauert has withdrawn from consideration as UN ambassador: "The past two months have been grueling for my family and therefore it is in the best interest of my family that I withdraw my name..."
@kmele @tomselliott I think it was. You're welcome to disagree! I think celebrity activist types weaponized the story, for instance
@tomselliott That's not what i said. I said it was weaponized in many different ways. I didn't specify which ways.
@GayPatriot We started our live coverage around 6:45. It's continuing now

Do a pair of ATVs cost $8,980 or $5,438 or $7,254? The crowd kept telling Brandy to change her answer. She had it right ($5,438!) but she gave into peer pressure and went with $8,980. Life lesson: Trust your gut.

Spinning the wheel! Heather spun, got a 10, spun again, got a 20. Doesn't get any worse than that. Ieecha spun, got a 50, decided NOT to spin again. Risky. I think I would have spun again. Robert spun and won with a 90.

@carenbWoke yes-- senators introduced a new bill yesterday

Free press advocates gathered by the White House today to call attention to a looming deadline related to the Khashoggi case. Here's our story with the details... https://t.co/TUfKkmF2y8
Former Fox reporter Lea Gabrielle "is expected to be appointed to lead the State Department agency in charge of efforts to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation," @kylieatwood @MichLKosinski @jmhansler report https://t.co/UTH8u4ya3W

Spotify and The New York Times have some things in common... https://t.co/aQYPdwfFSA
In October, Corker and Menendez triggered the Magnitsky Act, giving Trump 120 days to say whether MbS "is responsible for Mr. Khashoggi's murder." The deadline is tomorrow. There are doubts that the W.H. will respond, so advocates are holding a presser to pressure the admin.

@GOminiFab @MarkDavis @realDonaldTrump Yes. I wrote it. But the comparable speech for Trump's third such speech is Obama's third speech, which was in 2011...

@EJZ206 @realDonaldTrump Hmm. In 2010 Obama's speech had 48 million viewers.
Final #'s for the #SOTU are in, and @realDonaldTrump should be pleased: His speech averaged 46.8 million viewers, topping Obama's comparable speech from 2011. Here's my full story https://t.co/I8yk0Mm7Y1

Competing realities after the speech... here are some of the examples https://t.co/bntx8eUKGk
"This is a big big moment for the president," @mschlapp said on Fox tonight, calling #SOTU a chance for Trump to reach beyond his base. But Trump's past speeches haven't swayed public opinion...
On a live "Daily Show" after #SOTU, @TrevorNoah mock-applauded Trump's reading abilities: "I don't know if he's ready for a second term, but he's definitely ready for the second grade." https://t.co/lX69NuG50e
After the Trump and Abrams speeches: @AOC was interviewed live on NBC... @CoryBooker was on CBS... @AdamSchiff was on CNN... @AmyKlobuchar was on MSNBC... https://t.co/Z7e1d7HUTO
Per CNN's poll of #SOTU viewers, "the audience had the largest partisan tilt measured in any CNN instant poll following a presidential address to Congress dating back to 2001..." https://t.co/B1VVmPKmGt
LATE OF THE UNION: Tuesday night / Wednesday morning's @ReliableSources digest is out https://t.co/csBqwNK8lx
Dozens of CNNers are contributing to this detailed fact-check of the #SOTU https://t.co/n37U31wB33
"This was not a particularly good speech," @StephenAtHome says on a live "Late Show." But "what it lacked in quality, it made up in length. This speech was like watching paint lie."
Hey, @EricTrump and @SeanHannity are in agreement: This was the "best speech he's ever given."
@DonLDay ha, exactly
This is valuable context, but I don't think it's a "fact check" https://t.co/RvnxRxZy3W
And now Hannity is giving his own State of the Union speech https://t.co/o4VvOdGJOr
CBS offered a brief "reality check" of SOTU, but didn't address Trump's most egregious misstatements. Have you seen other fact-checking on air? https://t.co/LYMTfRYm6z
@katzish you got it
Here's the @VanJones68 review: "A psychotically incoherent speech, with cookies and dog poop."
"He spent more time on the wall than any other single issue tonight," @GStephanopoulos says.  "Despite the fact that 60% of Americans do not actually want this wall," @CeciliaVega adds.
He never mentioned the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which just ended 10 days ago.
https://t.co/klNnQ9GJpQ
&gt;&gt; @alexburnsNYT in the NYT live chat: "It‚Äôs worth stepping back and letting it sink in that we have a Republican president defending, at length, direct negotiations with North Korea and the Taliban."
"You weren't supposed to do that!"
Some of Trump's ad-libs are v. significant.  The prepared text: "I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally."  What he said: "I want people to come into our country, IN THE LARGEST NUMBERS EVER, but they have to come in legally."
And there's the "caravan" reference I expected. "As we speak, large organized caravans are on the march." Fox News has been hyping this new "caravan" for a full week. Details here... https://t.co/7Crt4NPm6Y
From @anniekarni in the NYT's live chat: Pelosi "is reading a copy of the president‚Äôs speech that he handed to her, per spokesman." https://t.co/r5xpVbyNsy

Every morning for the past week, "Fox &amp; Friends" hosts have been talking about a new "caravan" threat... and the migrants arrived at the border just in time for tonight's SOTU https://t.co/tLwMUaQnrn
If you haven't been watching Fox or reading right-wing websites, you probably haven't heard about the new "caravan." But President Trump has heard a LOT about it from his Fox friends. Here's my new story https://t.co/tLwMUaQnrn
Breakthrough parenting moment: @SunnyStelter now knows how to say "Google." @JamieStelter gets credit for saying "Hey Google" so often
A month ago, in his prime time address, Trump urged "every citizen" to "CALL CONGRESS and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border." I never heard anything about a surge of calls, did you?
&gt;&gt; @DLind: "The more symbolically important Trump‚Äôs border fight gets, the more desperately he needs to build a literal wall." https://t.co/oR6DbOjGtS
Watching this "Fox &amp; Friends" interview with @EricTrump. He says things like the president "hasn't left the White House in five weeks" -- knowing Trump just got back from Mar-a-Lago -- and the hosts don't blink. Don't even bother to correct him. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø https://t.co/pnqTW4IlFB

@mabbott83 @RichBTIG @CNN just got it. the total "TV" viewership, per Nielsen's current definition of "TV," which includes CBS All Access: 98.2 mil. That's the closest thing to an apples to apples comp to last year's 103.4 mil. Take the 98.2 mil, add all other streams, and espanol, and it's 100.7 mil.
Super Bowl LIII averaged 100.7 million viewers across several channels and streaming outlets, according to Nielsen. Even counting streaming, this is the lowest total for a Super Bowl match-up since 2009. Full story here https://t.co/71XRAfvVd9
@RichBTIG @CNN Yes, but... CBS is including EVERYTHING in the 100.7 mil #, including streaming, so it's not apples to apples to prior years. Updating my story here now https://t.co/71XRAfvVd9
@JKDAnthony10 i care about a lot of things, but i'm a media reporter, so today i'm tweeting about a huge media event. i really think you're looking for an immigration or politics or crime reporter...

Record high-scoring season for the NFL, and game ratings were up 5% on average.  Record low-scoring Super Bowl, and it was down 5% year-over-year. https://t.co/bTairhyZKW
@stuartitter nah, a 5-minute interview at 3:30 really has no bearing on the ratings starting at 6:30
Preliminary #'s for Sunday night's #SuperBowl show a 5% decline from last year's game. With almost everyone except Patriots fans calling the low-scoring game a snooze, it's a wonder that the ratings weren't even lower... Here's my take https://t.co/8fDexFXDlT

@dbongino Dan, I don't care enough about you to take cheap shots at you. Ask your new bosses about the demo.
@dbongino Dan, I said the "demo." That's what the entire business runs on. Not "total viewers." Like I said, all the cable news nets are doing well. That's why your weird attacks against me don't make sense. I really hope you feel better soon.

@tmitch4040 @ReliableSources @donlemon yes. that's possible. that's why i brought it up. but it's incredibly unlikely, given that the marist # was an outlier. i showed 4 other recent polls that had him between 25 and 35% support among latinos.

To Fox's credit, the @FoxAndFriends are showing skepticism about the WH's claims that "rank and file Dems" are ready to make a deal. "They want to work with us!" Gidley says. @PeteHegseth is betting him that they're not. Banner: "WILL DEMS NEGOTIATE ON BORDER SECURITY?"
Fox's alternative reality:  @KatiePavlich: "Did the president cave on this issue?"   @hogangidley45: "100% no. The president stood up for the American people. He opened the government..."
These are some of the questions W.H. reporters shouted as Trump wrapped up his speech today:  "Mr. President, was this a waste?"  "Why did you cave?"  "Were you aware Roger Stone was updating your campaign on WikiLeaks?"
&gt; @ChuckTodd: "I talked to somebody very close to the president two days ago who said to me, for some reason, he's convinced himself this is his 'read my lips' promise -- the wall."
Six-column headline in Saturday's NYT https://t.co/BFSyGPXcty
@vplus @AlexKoppelman Yep, Porter House was jumping tonight. Wish I could tell you who it was!
Stone takes credit for coining the "build the wall" slogan. It became a key part of Trump's presidency. Trump forced shutdown over wall funding. That's why the FBI agents who arrested Stone today were working without pay. https://t.co/fRLR0QTZvw https://t.co/g92pewHWu6

@AaronBlake Breathtaking in its shamelessness.
Millions of people are being sold cheap lies about journalism today, and millions are being told the truth. The difference is stark and sad.

welcome to Thursday! here's the latest edition of my media newsletter. dozens of stories from the past 24 hours... https://t.co/hVllmi32wf
BuzzFeed, @SeanHannity, Cond√©, @TamronHall, @zengerle, Sinclair, @SAGawards, and much more in tonight's media digest: https://t.co/ho2pYRPV5j
There are two covers of @TIME this week: One showing Albertina Contreras, and the other showing her daughter Yaquelin. They were separated at the U.S. border for nearly 6 weeks... https://t.co/b9VjppuvVG
Big hat tip to @fmanjoo in tonight's newsletter. I agree with his new column: "It's time we journalists all considered disengaging from the daily rhythms of Twitter." https://t.co/ho2pYRPV5j
In tonight's @ReliableSources: Trump v. Pelosi... Sinclair's balancing act... layoffs at BuzzFeed and Verizon... changes at Hulu... and much more... https://t.co/ho2pYRPV5j
Mueller "is stuck between pressure from those who want his team to keep discussing news stories, and a desire to maintain silence..." https://t.co/Y7wrruqfwc
@joeleverone @bennyjohnson amen.
@bennyjohnson shame on you. i hope you man up, someday, and apologize for this sick post.
My educated guess: No. It'll just be a "speech during the govt shutdown," without wall to wall coverage. Broadcast nets continue to have a high bar for interrupting prime time. https://t.co/98tDLWLUZ1
"This is going to be a tough week," EIC @BuzzFeedBen wrote to staffers tonight. BuzzFeed News will be affected by layoffs like the rest of the company. Details still to come. https://t.co/I7lUDVQLhl
BuzzFeed staffers have been bracing for bad news for days. But this is particularly bad. About 220 of the company's 1,450 employees will be out. https://t.co/I7lUDVQLhl
BuzzFeed is preparing to announce a significant round of layoffs ‚Äî 15% across the company ‚Äî according to sources familiar with the matter. https://t.co/I7lUDVQLhl
@rvalentwit You're not engaging with my point, which is that it's not "all about the ratings," but okay, have a good day!
@rvalentwit Busy news cycles, in general, drive viewership and thus revenue. But airing Trump speeches typically means forgoing ads, so I think the "ratings" explanation doesn't add up.
Yet more layoffs at Gannett-owned papers across the country. Awful. https://t.co/KCx8CuRG9L
@rvalentwit How is it all about the ratings when these events air commercial free?!
Predictable attack, but hey thanks for picking a decent photo of me at least! https://t.co/wcxUo8qLqm
This scroll on @BrookeBCNN's show tells the shutdown story so well -- it lists all of the damage that's being done https://t.co/UvivQzZoK8
A reporter just asked Pelosi: What happens if Trump still shows up for SOTU on 1/29? Well, he'd have to speak outside. A reminder from @CSPAN: The House speaker "controls the video and audio from the House chamber. If the House is not in session, there's no video feed to show."
Update: Pelosi says "cancelled." https://t.co/qwXm0kTItM
Trump's previous speeches about the border and the shutdown have not swayed public opinion in his favor -- why would a SOTU speech be any different? https://t.co/XSVjUPJEnL
New Lanny Davis statement says the Feb. 7 Michael Cohen hearing is off: "Due to ongoing threats against his family" from Trump and Giuliani, as well as Cohen's "continued cooperation with ongoing investigations," his appearance "will be postponed to a later date."
@CJamesDixon1 Nice try, but no. Pelosi controls the House, so she controls whether Trump speaks in the House chamber.
In "Apprentice" language: Trump wants his show -- SOTU -- to go on. Pelosi has the power to cancel it. https://t.co/RcwJdM1VMx
Agreed. Just made this point on @CNN. Last year 46 million people watched ‚Äì in a country of 300+ million https://t.co/b7kE3DjBkd

Get caught up: Here's a Twitter moment all about my BuzzFeed interview https://t.co/mn5wA3x6Oi
BuzzFeed says Trump told Cohen to lie. How, exactly? Did Trump use mob-like language? "We don't know," @a_cormier_ told me. "We're trying to get the exact language that was used." But he reiterated: Last Thursday's story is "accurate." https://t.co/eHX266GIe6
@Salem_Solomon @VOANews Agreed. Those staffers told me they could not be quoted by name. I would love more quotes on the record!
@KayBrannigan Thank you very much
@DanRobinsonDC @USAGMgov I meant in their news coverage. And I'm curious for any tips you can share re: that broader topic.

@RaheemKassam You have this backwards. It's incumbent on the White House to back up the president's assertions, it's not your job or my job.
When Trump says stuff like this, and THEN says the drug problem "would be quickly and greatly reduced" with a wall, it's a total distortion of the truth https://t.co/Y6XGfddtkH
In a speech about border wall $$, Trump tried out a new stat: He said drugs "cost our society in excess of $700 billion" a year. The NIH's most recent # is $740 billion, but that includes tobacco use, alcohol, etc. Not just drugs smuggled from Mexico. https://t.co/mcrEb91z3N https://t.co/Z2Wue6SVtp
@Equanimous_1 @AnaCabrera That's what i sought to do. I agree, that's what viewers need!
@tanguay_carol üòâ
@5OhHellNo I did during the tv segment. For example, in a speech about border wall money trump said drugs cost the country $700 bil a year, but most of that awful cost has nothing to do with Mexico. It's alcohol, tobacco use, etc
@RaheemKassam this is the government's most up to date data. by all means, pressure them for more! but the president used the figure to give people a complete misimpression.
@DavidWohl last week "reliable sources" out-rated Fox and MSNBC in its time slot in the most important demo, 25-54. so much for a "shrinking pool." thanks for the chance to share that stat!
Part one of Trump's speech was a repeat of his recent prime time address, complete with many of the same misleading claims. Part two was a shutdown message. https://t.co/etWNZDKPOU
After Trump's speech, @AnaCabrera asks, "Did this get us any closer to ending the government shutdown?" @PrestonCNN: "Absolutely not."

@creynoldsnc @SRuhle Could be. But in this case, I think there were many other factors. Tlaib was on tape -- story happened instantly. King was quoted in print -- it's been more of a slow build -- partly due to the reactions or LACK of reactions from other political leaders.
The FBI "would have had to possess strong evidence that Trump posed a national security threat to meet the threshold for opening such an investigation. But the more important Q now is not how or why the case was OPENED, but whether it was ever CLOSED." https://t.co/VxhzlPpWAg

@mialynneb @jonfavs turn on the TV -- the King coverage has been extensive yesterday and today on CNN and MSNBC.
@TylerDinucci @jonfavs I watch a lot of cable news, and King is being covered practically every hour on CNN
@ParkerMolloy @jonfavs i'm citing Fox's lack of King coverage, not talking about Tlaib. Re: Tlaib, you're welcome to believe that it was a "non-story." I think it WAS a story, and obviously most American newsrooms agreed! I said on air that I thought the story was mostly about impeachment, NOT cursing.
@jonfavs agreed, but i think that if MM does another count in, let's say, a month, it'll find more King coverage overall. (Although that depends on whether Fox takes the issue seriously.)

@PHIrociousApe @jonfavs Did you watch yesterday? There were so many King segments that I lost count. Including in prime time.
@jonfavs some thoughts: 1) there should be more coverage of King. 2) there WAS a lot more, on friday. 3) Tlaib was on cam, King in print. 4) MFer was day 1 of new Congress. 5) Tlaib cursing segments were also about Dems calling for impeachment. 6) Fox is mostly ignoring the King story.

Hot take: The accumulation of daily deceptions and fear-mongering matters a LOT more than a single speech. But this episode has sparked some smart discussions about the media's Trump coverage.
@TonyMaciulis @LifespanOfAFact Still need to see that!!
@fxshaw Hello from Jaleo! @chefjoseandres for the win, always
I'm listening to Trump's speech at a busy restaurant in Las Vegas ‚Äî the only one paying attention ‚Äî a reminder that most folks never tune in these addresses, no matter the president or topic. They hear bits and pieces later, if at all.

@Max_Lederman i do see it, and that's why i reflected it in my story and in my newsletter
@_Zeets people also remember that virtually all of Obama's addresses WERE carried live, just like clinton's, bush's, etc...
Most Americans see right through Trump's tricks. Poll after poll shows that most Americans do not trust him. That's why I'm skeptical that any prime time address will change minds. Whether it will intensify support/opposition is another Q...

CNN's @BLowryonTV: "Trump seldom experiences clear admonition for regularly spouting falsehoods. Denying him live, unfiltered access without some sort of screening or vetting doesn't seem like an unreasonable condition to impose under the circumstances..." https://t.co/L6nn8b7GAa
According to a network source, it seems likely that the broadcasters will agree to the Dem request, but "they haven't yet because they need more information first. Who is going to speak? For how long?" Standard Q's in a situation like this. https://t.co/OSUDzJeXTD
One of the powers of the presidency is the prime time Oval Office address to the nation. President Trump has decided to use this power to discuss his demands for border wall funding. Will he change ANY minds? https://t.co/L6nn8b7GAa

@alliegoldenpen It was a busy TV time of year, 6 years into a presidency, the WH never officially asked for the air time, the news climate was very different, etc. I'm not defending it, I'm offering up some of the potential reasons.
@Tkaynoel There's decades of precedent for carrying presidential addresses to the nation live.
@ParkerMolloy Relevant facts: It was a busy TV time of year, 6 years into a presidency, the WH never officially asked for time, the news climate was different, etc.
@DustinGiebel @Throwsshade Yep, that too
@Dsquared75 Almost all of Obama's prime time addresses were carried live, just like every other prez.
@Throwsshade CNN did. You'd have to ask the broadcast networks. It was a busy TV time of year, 6 years into a Presidency, the WH never officially asked for time, the news climate was different, etc. I'm not defending it, I'm offering up some of the potential reasons.
One of the flaws in this argument: Trump's speech actually cuts into ad time. If anything, the speech will shave a bit off network viewership. https://t.co/As87nQ1pgP
@RyanHillMI This time is different. Shutdown, etc. Also, thwt carried most of Obama's prime time addresses live.
@RyanHillMI They carried most of Obama's prime time addresses live.
For network execs, tradition and news judgment ‚Äî "a presidential address from the Oval Office" ‚Äî outweighed concerns about a speech filled with falsehoods. https://t.co/JLHsrkdRQz
Update to the update: NBC, ABC, and CBS will all carry Trump's address Tuesday night. Wall to wall coverage of his pro-wall speech. Hopefully surrounded by fact-checking. https://t.co/ttRKY7xVWG
Five hours since Trump announced his prime time address, and CBS is the only broadcaster that has committed to carrying it. The others are still deliberating. Updated story here https://t.co/ttRKY7xVWG
My thought exactly: https://t.co/pqv62hilEf
@craignewman In that case, they'll stick with regular programming
Thanks for the plug -- here's part 1 of the interview, on Trump https://t.co/S8vthbCTKV and part 2, on war coverage https://t.co/AQZ2NmHzGS https://t.co/zyMim4GuvS
TV exec texts: "He calls us fake news all the time, but needs access to airwaves‚Ä¶ If we give him the time, he'll deliver a fact-free screed without rebuttal. And if we don't give him the time, he'll call every network partisan. So we are damned if we do and damned if we don't."
This just in from a network source: "Time has been requested tomorrow night for 9p. Networks are deliberating."
I'm waiting to hear back from ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox broadcast about whether they will carry Trump's prime time address tomorrow night. The networks don't automatically say yes when a president asks for airtime.

This is how @FoxAndFriends tricks viewers: @Kilmeade said @AOC "wants people taxed as high as 80, 90% if you make $10 million or more." Huh? She said "60 or 70%" on "your 10 millionth dollar."
The "wall" funding fight is also a fight over facts. Trump is lying and stoking fear about immigration. His aides are sharing misleading statistics. And his media allies are echoing the falsehoods... https://t.co/G3SJE4dKAV

Q from @oliverdarcy: "Should news outlets immediately air Trump's pool sprays in full?" https://t.co/H0fhJHE8xS https://t.co/hoFRQtijDc
@TomWJones @JillAbramson thanks. this was striking: "The depth and intensity of the coverage was masterful. On most days it outshone the Post's. The news report as a whole had never been stronger." p.s. the book is up on GOOGLE BOOKS already ;-) https://t.co/h8Djzp1Crd
--&gt; @CostaReports: "An ongoing government shutdown, volatile financial markets, the special counsel probe, right-wing discontent over Trump‚Äôs failure to secure funding for a border wall, and empowered House Democrats all loom before the president..." https://t.co/bN3O4D46A0

&gt;&gt; @CillizzaCNN: "Tomorrow is the day Donald Trump's presidency totally changes" https://t.co/RoWNIlI1NT
This is a remarkable farewell memo by William Arkin -- describing his time at NBC News as "gratifying" -- but clearly frustrated by the "Trump circus" and the state of TV news https://t.co/2ipGHFGzrt
Romney to Tapper: "I don't intend to be a daily commentator" about Trump but "if there's a matter of great significance, I'll speak out on that."

Some of @geoffreyfowler's 2019 predictions: "Sheryl Sandberg will leave Facebook as its woes continue." Trump will get "into a big fight with an ever-bigger Amazon." And "Apple is going to squeeze more money from you" via "subscriptions for news and video" https://t.co/HI2SetUrrY

Bongino screaming about Romney on @FoxAndFriends: "YOU BIG PHONY FRAUD FAKE. You should have never taken that endorsement, if this is how you felt. This guy's a disgrace. He's an embarrassment." On Trump: "What's the character problem here?" (Re-read the op-ed, Dan)
Romney's first live interview since his "Trump's character falls short" op-ed will be on @TheLeadCNN with @JakeTapper this afternoon üì∫

@TKNNPolJungle @JaniceDean i feel genuinely bad for all the angry people on this platform. it's new years day!
@peterjhasson if by "standard," you mean "my light-hearted tweet about fox's tendency to criticize Dems," sure, go wild. but i can think of 100,000 better ways to spend 2019!
@kap_chan i watched all the shows and enjoyed all the shows -- CNN's, Fox's, ABC's, NBC's, etc. i hope you have a merry 2019 and stop assuming the worst about people.
@arsenalsdove my fault for doing it by myself that day! d'oh. thanks for watching anyway.
@dbongino I was being light-hearted. I really hope you have a better 2019 than this.
@MaxB1ack hey, yep, my fault for doing it myself :) happy new year!

@bstnboy @FoxNews @MSNBC thanks for the note. i mentioned that fox's ratings sometimes get soft when there's bad news for trump. but it's usually temporary. msnbc is doing well, and so is fox. re: advertisers, we've written several stories about that.
@Silvanabfer @JamieStelter @SunnyStelter thanks, same to you!

President Trump is ringing in the new year with his friends at Fox News ‚Äî literally. He is wrapping up 2018 with a phone interview on Fox's NYE show. Here's my new story about the pair https://t.co/E33Kppfn0N

Reporters in Times Square need something to say all day. So: Tons of "heightened security" talk. Threats come from many directions, yes, but news coverage should note this: "The Islamic State is weakened, &amp; the jihadist threat to the U.S. has diminished." https://t.co/P6DNSn7yuJ
Shoutout to some others celebrating a 12/31 birthday like @JamieStelter: Diane von Furstenberg, @JeffFlake, @DonaldJTrumpJr, @PeteSouza, @JoelAchenbach, Val Kilmer, @HawleyMO, @gabrielledoug!
@DonLDay congratulations!!!
Notice Elizabeth Warren never says Trump's name... but uses Fox as a stand-in... she decries "an echo chamber of fear and hatred" while Hannity, Carlson and Ingraham appear. Plus clips of Conway, Bannon, Miller. https://t.co/mlAO5KdoOF
Hegseth's chat with Trump tonight will be... drumroll please... the president's 41st interview with Fox. Here's my end-of-the-year look at the Trump-Fox union https://t.co/6V0ZiXarNo
Trump will be talking to @PeteHegseth on the @FoxNews New Year's special tonight... it's reminiscent of 2015, when Trump rang in 2016 live from Mar-a-Lago... this year, Trump is at the White House https://t.co/htxxWt4xeZ https://t.co/FNFGjLtCSU

@JChapuran You haven't read it, so how would you know?
A big part of my annual self-evaluation is trimming my total # of stories into a list of what was "memorable." This year: "Shithole." Books about Trump. Brief briefings. Bans. Oprah. Sinclair. CBS. "Catch and kill." Bourdain. Capital Gazette. AT&amp;T. https://t.co/AwnYn6Ccf7
Every December, for more than a decade, I've compiled a list of every story I wrote that year. The 2018 total: 400 stories. If you're a reporter, I highly recommend this list-making exercise... https://t.co/kA45CAXN06
@talk2manuel I said "lies" in that segment.

"It was always very clear to me that this wasn't about Harvey Weinstein. It wasn't even about Hollywood. This was about SYSTEMS deployed by very powerful, very wealthy people to suppress these kinds of allegations" --@RonanFarrow on @ReliableSources https://t.co/teo9miebaM
"News fatigue" doesn't just effect the audience:   Editors have to "make sure that our journalists are able to handle that pace too" while "keeping up our standards," @SallyBuzbee says https://t.co/U7XRSu7u3n
@Fara1 @kathleencarrll @ReliableSources That's right, it was Kathleen! ‚úÖ
@nycsouthpaw @AdamBlickstein @mattyglesias Agreed!
That's a wrap on this week's -- and this year's -- show. Feedback welcome!
@AdamBlickstein @mattyglesias She said it's a concern a lot of people have. I don't think it's controversial to say that many people have a hard time keeping up with the daily twists and turns of the investigations. I think that's reality. Team Trump TRIES to make it confusing.
@mattyglesias Right -- that's the "truly very serious" part.
@bluesboy23 @dannagal @ReliableSources Not today! It's quiet
Thanks! All credit to the guests -- @KathleenCarrll, @MurrayMatt, @SallyBuzbee. They're back with 2019 predictions later this hour https://t.co/3dYri8JxL4
Up next on @ReliableSources: Three rival reporters who exposed misconduct at CBS. @Irin, @RonanFarrow and @RachelAbramsNY
@Readman @ReliableSources thanks for the feedback. millions of people under 30 do consume cable news. the data is pretty clear about that. some of the consumption happens via TV, but also via web video, social media, etc.
@dannagal @ReliableSources i appreciate the feedback... i thought of it as a handy way to cover numerous media stories in just a few minutes
@ptj13031 @CNN thanks for the feedback. can you be specific about a "lie?"
@EsteDiaz332 @ReliableSources @CNN @SallyBuzbee @murraymatt @kathleencarrll @POTUS my apologies for the typo.
AP editor @SallyBuzbee: The Trump-Russia probes have "gone on so long that it's difficult to be able to assess what in this investigation is truly very serious and what is not as serious. So that is one thing that journalists struggle with a little bit..."
@robinwarshaw I don't think I'm making it a "game." I see lots of issue coverage.
&gt;&gt; @KathleenCarrll on "Reliable:" "It's easier to demonize a profession when you don't know how it works... Explaining HOW you know what you know is really, really important."
Showtime! @ReliableSources is on @CNN now... we're talking about news fatigue, media biz models, Big Tech, threats to press freedom, and more... panelists: @SallyBuzBee, @MurrayMatt and @KathleenCarrll üì∫

Sometimes Trump's tweets are even more shocking when read out loud. @RyanNobles on @CNN: "The president says Democrats are to blame when children die at the border. That's not reading between the lines or interpreting something out of context, those are his words directly."
