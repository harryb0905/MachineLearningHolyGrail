No, but this morning it was heavy on my mind and heart! Just really assessing some of these people I call friends or associates and what exactly they are or aren’t bringing to the table?

I’m starting to realize as I grow older I have less patience for BS and wasting my time on things or people that aren’t helping me grow! I even find myself ignoring phone calls of friends or people that I know well but I already know the phone call is going to waste my time! 🤷🏾‍♂️

A dark place can be a place of guilt, shame, regret, depression, illness, loneliness, etc. Whenever you are going through a dark place it doesn’t mean God has left you! MLK, Malcom X, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali went through it...a dark place is a prerequisite for greatness!
Your tougher than you think you are. You can handle more than you think you can. Look how far you have come. Look what you have been through. Yes you may not be where you want to be in life but thank god you are not where you use to be! God was always there, he never left! 🙌🏾

Food for thought as we enter into the post season: there have been zero $100M QB’s to win a super bowl in the last 15 years so you think this year will be the first? That would mean Andrew Luck and the Colts get in...🤔

I see yall wasn’t as passionate when I brought up Priests sexually assaulting kids, which has been happening longer then I been alive, yet when I said Bill Cosby you jumped, when I mentioned Trump and Kavanaugh you were quick to defend! 🤔 Your silence is deafening SMH!
Let’s have a REAL CONVERSATION! These people are leading CHURCH and assaluting KIDS! KIDS! Come on fam! Are these Priest in prison? Are they on at least on trial? 🤔 Go ahead hit me with your excuses today I got time! Ready, set, go... https://t.co/2LKb0nRnKX

They have ways to protect fields it’s 2018. They can cover it with plastic rain tarps, they have machines and built in systems that can dry fields quicker, etc. I’ll let you in on a little secret, the issue is $$$ it cost more money to maintain grass fields period! https://t.co/2eJvjGmgav

Man we needed that turnover gave us some life need to capitalize now
Targeting shouldn't be an automatic disqualification should be a penalty and warning second time then disqualified.
They need to review that one too
Another terrible call
That was clutch! #SamDarnold
Lots of big plays on both sides this game is living up to the hype!
I like this kid Sam Darnold a lot! Aggressive mentality, eyes always down the field, accurate, poised, can scramble if needed, leader, ✌🏾
Damn! That was nice even I have to admit SMH
Man they need this in the league
Ref blew that call bad 😡
Terrible call
