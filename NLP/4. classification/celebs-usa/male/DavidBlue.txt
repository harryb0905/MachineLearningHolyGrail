Pilot Season is like speed dating, except everyone is crawling over each other for the only, single person at the bar, but you aren’t what that person “had in mind” and also you just got a ticket and it’s snowing and the bar is on fire.

...speak up. You will be heard. You deserve help. Bad shit happens in the world &amp; we’ve gotta be there for each other. Yeah, some people lie, some people are douchecanoes. But as long as humans have ears, you’ll find someone who will listen. You are not alone. (7/7)
...I don’t know Jussie. I don’t know of and can’t comment on his situation. We shouldn’t, none of us, until all the facts are known. But to all victims out there, to any who have had something happen or, God-bless, will... (6/7)
...until the burden of proof. That’s their job. It’s self-preservation and the only way to investigate something thoroughly - avoiding bias. I hated not feeling believed, even vaguely. But in the end, I’m glad they cared enough to even report it at all... (5/7)
...as much as I still remember how it felt to hear that headline, the day after wondering if we’d even survive the mugging, I also remember having to let it go. Reporters, police, &amp; the general public are allowed to maintain healthy skepticism... (4/7)
...until it had been thoroughly investigated, the reporters were doing their job - reporting what they could, but careful to confirm or deny anything officially until the facts were all known... (3/7)
...I mean, here I had just had a gun shoved in my face and I woke up to what felt like distrust, disbelief and lack of empathy. But my (now ex) reminded me that this was just good reporting... (2/7)
THREAD: When I got mugged leaving the #UglyBetty wrap party over a decade ago, I woke up to news outlets headlining “what Ugly Betty actor claims to have been mugged?” ...the word ‘claimed’ immediately bothered me. It went right under my skin... (1/7)

Oh FFS, people. Stop hating on something you haven’t even seen yet. Or a person you don’t know. Or a concept you don’t yet understand. That’s judging before experience. “Pre-judging,” if you will. Prejudice. Hmmmm... that word sounds familiar. 🤔 https://t.co/bcAV280mPm

Workout Pro Tip: Track your progress by taking a photo of yourself once a week. But set “photo day” the day AFTER your weekly cheat meal. That way you’re tracking real progress. Not just when your brain thinks you’re “skinny.”
“Other” does not mean “bad.”

@vilybebe @mikamckinnon @SGFansUnited @dhewlett That’s a huge mistake. 1) the creators cared and protected both science and plot. That’s why @mikamckinnon was so invaluable. 2) Young treated Eli because of his instincts and they had been working together. It wasn’t a comment on McKay’s abilities. It was about trust.

I dunno, man. The number of people who seemed cool and then we find out, years later, that they’re terrible people now. It’s almost like, I dunno... maybe we shouldn’t judge people until they’re done? Like, maybe at the end of their life or something. Just spitballin’.
@dajuanjohnson @SchittsCreek, #Speechless or #TheGoodPlace are my go-to’s for that.

We go on social media and complaint about the state of the world. Or post how we relate to the latest terrible thing. And that’s it. Our catharsis complete by yelling into the void... I wonder, if we didn’t have social media, if we’d instead be spurred to action?

Go you, America. A country where it’s not about 100% winning or losing. But about everyone fighting for what they believe is right. We fuck up. We fail. We try harder. We fail again. But son of a B, we try. And as long as we’re trying, there’s hope.
Just discovered the brilliance that is @Speechless_ABC. I’m sad that it has taken me so long to watch it. That being said, I have devoured all three seasons in a week. I love this show. Amazing writing, fantastic acting &amp; brilliant blend of comedy and heart.

TRUE COSTUME STORY: I decided to have a little fun once &amp; went to a costume party with a cardboard goatee + my SGU costume = “Darkest Timeline Eli.” The very 1st person I ran into said: “awww, can’t let it go?” Aaaaand I spent the rest of the night with my hoodie zipped up.
It’s everyone’s favorite game: “WHICH OF DAVID’S PAST COSTUMES IS HE GOING TO LAZILY RECYCLE THIS YEAR!?”
@maudegarrett Yesssssssss
@levarburton Break legs!
@EmmeRylan ❤️
@LouDPhillips Or a beet. Turnip the beet.
Another Halloween where intense &amp; disciplined pre-planning has led to a wildly creative costume of “guy who waited too long so is dressed as whatever he could find.”
A fun thing to do for a moment today is willingly forget it is Halloween and look around in wonder at how silly human beings can be.
@JeffGreenbergCD Gah!

@netk Setting the bar low for the seeming bulk of voices these days, who aim for any opinion whatsoever, despite a total lack of intelligence or research. But thanks for taking the time to contradict my message! Totally worth it.

No matter how often it tries to convince me otherwise, I believe humans can be good. CAN be. But like much in life, it will take hard work, humility, empathy and a commitment. We’re sliding backwards right now. But we can still course correct.

Humans have been around for a while now. Can we stop being surprised when a kid looks like their parents?
Don’t ever be surprised when it turns out that somebody driving like an asshole has vanity plates. I mean, it’s right there in the name.
@AstroKatie Yup
@aaronsagers Nope.
It’s confusing. It’s overwhelming. It’s intimidating. Do it anyway. It doesn’t take all that long. And it doesn’t matter if we agree. We may intrinsically want different things. Fine. VOTE. Because you can. And because it matters, even when it feels like it doesn’t. https://t.co/GZizWXhqJf

There’s a lightning storm in L.A. right now. Earth has gone cray-cray.
We’re at the point now that if I read news that our government repealed the American Revolution, I wouldn’t even be surprised.
@AnneWheaton To be fair, I did the same thing while living in Vancouver. So you’re less a “tourist” and more “a person who appreciates beautiful things.” :)

...Don’t ever look down on someone working hard to build the life they want or need. Lift them up. Support them. Cheer them on. We have a limited amount of time on this spinning rock, use it to raise others. Not bury them. (7/7) 🌈#TheMoreYouKnow
...A young father working three jobs to support his family is admirable. A student working a few gigs to get by is amazing. Hell, a Doctor driving Lyft on weekends to surprise her husband with an anniversary present is cool as hell. (6/7)
...Hell, I STILL teach acting &amp; audition coach on the side. Sure, I do it to help others (and because it’s fun), but you better believe the extra money is welcome! 😜  Let’s even take the entertainment industry out of the equation for a moment. (5/7)
...The businesspeople are chasing name recognition &amp; “guaranteed pre-sales” (though that business model is a Möbius strip of failure, but I’ll save that discussion for another time.) I’ve had many side gigs over the years. From waiter to editor to temp work. (4/7)
...Especially these days. The entertainment industry is tougher than ever. A lot of amazing writers, actors &amp; directors I know are struggling. While there is more content, opportunities are surprisingly more limited. (3/7)
...Real talk: as artists, there is no such thing as “job security.” There can be long stretches of inactivity between gigs, IF you’re lucky enough to work again, that is. As talented as someone might be, the stars very much have to align for an artist to get a paid job. ...(2/7)
Let’s chat. That recent twitter post criticism of Geoffrey Owens for having a day-job is ludicrous. Don’t ever shame a person for making a living. These days, it’s tough for ANYONE to get by and survival is a respectable pursuit.  ... (THREAD 1/7)

@SGFansUnited ...also, you deleted your other tweet, so I can’t reply to it, but: as I don’t follow you, a private DM is not possible. But appreciate the fandom. We all do. ;)
@SGFansUnited @StargateDaily @StargateZone @GateWorld @BaronDestructo @loudstranger @StargateNow @bradtravelers @Stargate_4ever @stargatecommand No worries. I actually thought this one may be @barondestructo’s. But I just wanted to remind ya to credit the original poster when possible. :) ❤️
@SGFansUnited @StargateDaily @StargateZone @GateWorld @BaronDestructo @loudstranger @StargateNow @bradtravelers @Stargate_4ever @stargatecommand Dude. Internet etiquette 101: link to someone’s photo if you want to repost it. Or, at the very least, credit them in your post.
@shewalksaway @SGFansUnited @StargateDaily @StargateZone @GateWorld @BaronDestructo @loudstranger @StargateNow @bradtravelers @Stargate_4ever @stargatecommand I have a bunch.

Hey girl, is your name Thanos? ‘cause awwwwww snap.
I don’t know, guys, I’m starting to feel like maybe dictators don’t keep their promises.
@Shiner_833 @FANEXPODallas @imcorinnemec @AlainaHuffman I’d love to come. (If invited.) @AlainaHuffman &amp; I would paint the town.
Running at the new week like... https://t.co/icHco7BPAP
@JewelStaite Teach me your ways, Obi-Wan.
Okey doke, we’re supposedly boarding now. (Though an employee just said the pilots are in a dispute with @FlyFrontier, so I’ll believe it when I see it.) But thanks for the Q’s and hope you enjoyed my A’s. Search #BlueandA for all the responses. :)
@WolfeShade Vancouver for SGU. Fell in love with the city. #BlueandA
@jslicer So far? Rome. #BlueandA
@KartesChris Click the link in my bio. Always the best way to know. #BlueandA
@JamesMuchowicz I think any of us would love to play again. #BlueandA
@jonhunnings Already made? Any role in Three Amigos, Neo in Matrix (the first one), Ewan’s in Moulin Rouge and Stiller in Secret Life of Walter Mitty for the travel &amp; adventure. #BlueandA
@blairherter Yeah, someone else bought my ticket. But after this experience, I’m pretty sure @FlyFrontier is the Geocities of airlines.
@dianamoher @dave1884 Hah. It was just for fun, to test my newly burgeoning writing skills. And also took place when I wrote it, between seasons one and two. It dealt with the discovery of Stargate seed ships and weirdly malfunctioning technology. #BlueandA
@RTPGiants Yes. Those ARE two words. #BlueandA
@ChrisWDay1983 I would’ve said Shazam but @ZacharyLevi is killing it. So, I’m gonna say Nightwing. Sign me up.
@mammaleelee Daniel Jackson. He got to be a nerd AND a superhero. #BlueandA @MichaelShanks
@OhanaMine @FlyFrontier I think Cthulhu is the pilot, actually. Would explain how they keep losing planes.
@RealMichaelW Nice. Give him a wasssup from me.
@OhanaMine I’m stuck in the hell that is @FlyFrontier purgatory. #BlueandA
@dave1884 I liked our cast, our scripts and our level of action. I was, and still remain, very proud of #SGU. It was a good show that suffered because of bad press release timing, bad production company timing and rash prejudgement by some members of fandom. #BlueandA
@RealMichaelW To be in? Little Shop. To see? Butterfinger’s Angel. With you? I was too inebriated to remember. :) #BlueandA
@dave1884 I actually wrote a two part episode just for fun between seasons 1 and 2. Sent it to my lawyer and rep just to show them. It was my first episodic script. #BlueandA
@Michealfinane You were dreaming. I was a child. #BlueandA
@dave1884 I have always enjoyed being active and was starting to feel lethargic and gross. Also, I wanted to play different kinds of roles. The SGU producers were totally on board.  #BlueandA
@FaithMDAmato Remains to be seen. #BlueandA
My flight has been delayed for hours. Good a time as any to answer some of your questions. Tweet them at me with the hashtag #BlueandA

“The Homeless Problem” - there are two types of people in this world: those that think it refers to the homeless and those that think it refers to the fact that people ARE homeless.

@photosbyroberth Yo. You gotta work on your reading comprehension, bud. Give it another looksie.
...for some reason, we just don’t want to.
It’s not. The only reason we think that is because we’ve allowed ourselves to think of white (usually men) as default. This makes no sense. We are all equal. All human. All beings. Break free of the mold. It only holds us back. Let’s all evolve. Humanity can be better than this.
A friend came on my podcast &amp; made a great point: when writers have to make up a placeholder name that can be any ethnicity in their script, it’s usually “Bob.” Or “John.” But if you write “Sanjay,” people assume it’s the writer declaring a character MUST BE. (Thread)
@photosbyroberth The only person who said it would be men is you.
@Shakeyp Bwahahahahaha. Yay tiny greys.
A gender-less grey biped. (Though being bipedal is in essence a human assumption.) Again, this is the problem. The majority assumes themselves default. That’s just ignorance or shortsightedness. https://t.co/kL3Qt3jGZv
@Jill_Up_Hill 🙌 Then we can be friends. :)
Hence the problem. What you consider default is not default. And the people who think so close their minds to their fellow beings. https://t.co/tGL0QKBglW
Thanos snaps his fingers and turns everyone the same color, sexuality, race &amp; gender. . . . . . . (*if you just pictured everyone as straight, white, human men, you’re part of the problem.)

@BrianLeeOkert Many current consumers of art feel entitled. A movie must be made for them, following guidelines they want. That is not art. Art is subjective. You can hear critique. You can take critique. But an artist creates art. They do not owe anyone the art they feel they deserve.

It makes sense to consider perfection when creating art. Because it’s a piece of you, from you. But stop expecting perfection when CONSUMING art. Connect with it or not. They appreciate you. But the artist does not owe you anything.

Not everyone has the luxury of a good home life. (And your 99% statistic is hyperbole.) Regardless, plenty of people struggle to overcome &amp; become good people.

#TBT to a few Ren Faires ago. This will be my zombie apocalypse survival team… https://t.co/uckcHnPVGA
Love this movie. And as this is one of my go-to karaoke songs, lemme just say: woot. https://t.co/0G1W3pmGSO
I’d love that, @paulagarces1 - here’s to hoping they get you on the show! :) https://t.co/iEV37frVTf
This was funbarassing. :) I had a blast talking with my buds over at @LegionofLeia yesterday - we chatted all sorts of crazy stuff. Including dating &amp; @Drunken__Gaming. And probably more than I should have. 😂 https://t.co/suHAe7w1I4
@KeahuKahuanui 😜
Woot! :) https://t.co/nOVHrXrJmp
@jumblejim @AloHuester Pretty sure I was patient zero in Chicago a couple years back. Oops. Come get my autograph and a cough.
@Yo_AdrienneW Aw. Yay. Thanks, love.
Family reunion with the one and only derpydoggoluna. Whose tongue has its own… https://t.co/ymAzEZSNYf
@AlainaHuffman That’s just a daily activity regardless.
@jedimasta @Drunken__Gaming @KellyHu @OsricChau @coconerdgirl @Vududaddy Oops. Hahahaha. Similar name to my friend. Sorry! But hey, support the show and come play with us! 😂
Rush hour in L.A goes from approximately 5 am until you’re dead.
@CollinsChadM @OsricChau @jedimasta @coconerdgirl @KellyHu @Vududaddy @kickstarter Thanks, brother!!!!!!!
@tvdvdguy @LegionofLeia Not even in the least. There’s a disclaimer before the show, not encouraging any sort of overdoing it, and not made for teens. Also, it’s table top games, not video games. And doesn’t say to follow our lead forever and not live your life. In general, just no.
About to go on the @LegionofLeia podcast to talk all things @cmdthemovie, SGU, our shiny Kickstarter (https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z) &amp; whatever else they ask me. Stay tuned!
@jessiepridemore @OsricChau @jedimasta @coconerdgirl @KellyHu @Vududaddy ONLY 7 MORE DAYS LEFT TO JOIN OUR SHOW! This is it, this is the endgame. If everybody doesn’t pitch in, Thanos wins.

@BadAstronomer I don’t think so. But I am turning a lovely shade of grey. 😐

TODAY’S REALISTIC HOROSCOPE: Something you read on your phone will be eerily accurate.
Yes, autocorrect, of course the word I was aiming for was “ablution”...  because I use that word so much. You know me so well. 🙄
@maudegarrett Best. Life.
Happy birthday to the great and powerful @AstroKatie! Make sure to wish her a truly wonderful one. She deserves it!
Here’s the beginning of @Drunken__Gaming! If @kellyhu’s laugh doesn’t make you smile, nothing will. We had a blast &amp; can’t wait to make more! Future eps will be available free - with your help! Brought to you by @osricchau, @jedimasta, @coconerdgirl, @kellyhu, @vududaddy &amp; me! https://t.co/9vRRXRGeMl
@RuthieConnell @jlg823 @AlainaHuffman 😜
ALL. OF. THE. YES. 🙌 Hot damn. @Lin_Manuel 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 https://t.co/Wisky4kjDX
@MalindaAltman I love them both. But as I’m partially allergic to cats, mostly dogs. #BlueAndA
@AZBastard I actually want one. So I’ll wait until I get it to tell ya. ;) #BlueAndA
@MorganWalker09 That’s a tough one. Handmaid’s Tale. Westworld. Shameless. Silicon Valley. Game of Thrones. Supernatural. You? #BlueAndA
@Juliemcniven @kimrhodes4real @jlg823 @AlainaHuffman @RuthieConnell I clearly know way too many people on this show. 😂 But in my defense, you, @Juliemcniven, are my favorite “stores food at my house and creates cool worlds with me” partner. #BlueAndA
@beachton Both! I’ve always loved board games. But they are definitely a nice distraction. And, unlike Minecraft, have an end. #BlueAndA
@kimrhodes4real @jlg823 @AlainaHuffman @RuthieConnell 😁 #BlueAndA
@SheilaColley @AlainaHuffman Healthy? Ground turkey tacos with a little bit of hot sauce. Not healthy? There’s a twitter character limit. Hehehehe. #BlueAndA
@kimrhodes4real @jlg823 @AlainaHuffman @RuthieConnell 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 because you’re my favorite star of Wayward Sisters. 😉
@jlg823 Old Fashioned. Or bourbon. But if we get @Drunken__Gaming funded, I’m assuming I will take a break. #BlueAndA
@reactionfaye I’m good. Stressed. A bit down. But good for the most part. You? #BlueAndA
@SheilaColley Best? Math. Favorite? Anything but math. #BlueAndA
@jlg823 Hmmmmm. Sam. Dean. Castiel. Abaddon (because, c’mon, @AlainaHuffman). And I always smile when @RuthieConnell is on screen. #BlueAndA
@Shortie9412 Sometimes. But I’ve learned to use my nerves as part of my audition. Something I teach, actually. :) #BlueAndA
🙌 🙌 https://t.co/yRk8fCBgvt
I’m bored and avoiding life. Sounds like the perfect time for a Q&amp;A! Ask me anything. (Use the hashtag #BlueAndA in your tweet)
@AlainaHuffman How dare you. No. Because I wasn’t thinking about that until now. Feel free to bring some over. 😬
Whoever acquires the most calories wins, right? RIGHT?!
@AlainaHuffman @AloHuester @OfficialBrianaB Save me a slice. And by “slice,” I mean my own whole pizza.
@this1wierdgirl Word spreading is appreciated.
@HangTheTJ With. And spikes.
Who plays @WordsWFriends? Let’s game together! The next 10 donations to @Drunken__Gaming of over $75 get a follow AND a game started... with me. Game on! :) https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z https://t.co/6KL5KjVW6G
@jessiepridemore @Drunken__Gaming @WordsWFriends Balls. Thanks. Fixing.
@kimrhodes4real 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌😜
@PeterKelamis Woo!
@BadAstronomer This is my spirit animal.
@aishatyler Badass powerhouse right there.
@SchmoopyWoopy Let’s hope!
@AmyBiancolli Twinsies
@AlainaHuffman Sure. Come over.
So far today I’ve gotten a laser pointer to the eye, had casting forget to hit record during an audition &amp; realized I have two left shoes at the gym. Forget “retrograde,” is Mercury HIGH? https://t.co/riti8nnMBj
If anyone knows the douchenozzle in LA who drives a grey/silver car with license plate 6YOB738 - He’s driving recklessly and shining a green laser pointer into driver’s eyes. I hope Thanos punches him in the taint.
@theyearofelan @Jaime_King @RealAdamRose 😂
@alisonhaislip You &amp; my hair fight crime together in their sleep.
Do you like gaming? Laughing? How about both?! Now add in a night of free-flowing spirits, and BOOM, this is for you! https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z https://t.co/cNGoK0nZYB
@pinkluna That was always the release platform goal, but the question was about people who pledged via Kickstarter being willing to donate again on another platform. And the show will always be the way it is now, so no kiddies.
@ellegant26 Nah. I loved that show!
@DoctorFrenchie 🙌🙌 you are awesome.
Thanos is just pissed off we wrote that song “Purple People Eater” about him.
Walking in NY, I side-stepped a man carrying something heavy to his car. It was @AlanCumming https://t.co/2qtzfRS0PH
Previous tweet notwithstanding, the goal is to fully fund this @Kickstarter. Don’t give up! Tell your friends, post about it and donate if you can. Let’s get the show made, TOGETHER! @Drunken__Gaming  https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z https://t.co/2pDuKkN63j
[walks into therapist’s office] DR: And what is wrong today? ME: I looked at twitter... [Doctor signals an air drop of anti-depressant prescriptions to fall on my face and puppies and also a balloon for some reason]
@julieannemery @EarleyKevin 🙌
Mayhaps. Hopefully we reach the goal in 10 days. But if not, those of you who have already donated — thoughts? https://t.co/fCGxyFOQtN
@AloHuester Found it! Thanks. :) Consider yourself followed!!!!
@JewelStaite 😂😂😂
@AloHuester And the donation amount?
@AloHuester Would you mind telling me the date and amount? So I can check it, and if it didn’t go through, alert Kickstarter? There are a few “Guest” donations not listed as names and I’d love to find out which one may be you!
[Sam Beckett leaps into 2018] SAM: Al? AL?! Why am I here? What went wrong that I have to put right? [Hologram Al looks at his display] AL: According to Ziggy ...everything.
@bergopolis OH BOY.
@Amandalexander Love seeing good people come together. :)
@candymit @KellyHu @Vududaddy @coconerdgirl Thanks! Sadly, the way @Kickstarter works, we ONLY receive the donated money if we fully reach our goal. So, if we don’t hut that goal, we get nothing. That’s why we need your help!
@AloHuester I’m looking at the backer report and don’t see your name listed. Are you sure you donated? When, and how much?
@KellyHu @erniereyesjr @UndeadGuy SURF NINJAS!!!!
@AmberSaysShine @themakingofCMD @jkeats @America_Young @zaki000 @taliatabin yay!!
@TeagWall 😂
A little post-filming love fest when we wrapped the pilot episode of #DrunkenGaming - we want you to see it! The link in my bio that leads to our KS, where you can come play with us. IF we reach our goal in 11 days. Spread the word!!!!  (@KellyHu @Vududaddy @coconerdgirl) https://t.co/EoHLHnJ7kF
@AloHuester For when??
Current mood. https://t.co/k25chUKqdd
@cpbinder I think you taught me in kindergarten.
It’s International Tabletop Day! What better way to celebrate than by helping your favorite peeps play table games &amp; mess up (a lot) so you can laugh along with them! Show your love! Only 11 days left!!!  https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z https://t.co/YIp5Kb0fpF
Should I just add a perk that I’ll follow you? That seems the most popular. 😂   https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z
@LouDPhillips I remember that guy!!!! You look the same. :)
Actual #OldHeadshotDay photo on my Instagram. Not my #FirstHeadshot, but it’s an old one for sure. Oh, and btw, donate to my Kickstarter! — https://t.co/PAWMgJeZxh
Non-spoiler “Avengers: Infinity War” review: FRACK. YES.
@Ladydchaos Indeed.
@karinagw I do Skype coaching as well. Email me the site!
@DanHistoryGuy Exactly.
@GodDamnItChelsi Why?
For those who don’t know, I’m an acting teacher / audition coach as well. I love helping others improve their craft. And I’ve got some spots in one of my classes! Get at me. :)  https://t.co/foSPeUD6Yb https://t.co/VtvaXT9HgH
We created a world where it’s more important to share what you’re doing at any given moment than it is to be aware of what’s going on in the world at any given moment.
Look forward to hanging with you all later this year. Come laugh with us. https://t.co/LNVIgRh6EI
Whenever I’m on the lot, I always wait an extra few minutes underneath to see if they’ll pop out. #YWDFoLife https://t.co/iXDcpwStmB
@AlainaHuffman Indeed. Tell Birmingham I said sup.
@PaulyMcGillion ALL. OF. THE. YES.
For those of you new to Kickstarter: you do not get charged until the project is funded! And the project is only funded once it reaches its goal. So don’t wait to support @Drunken__Gaming - https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z 😇 https://t.co/yurFuYna5m
NOW FOLLOWING @PBMom, @dan_boi91 &amp; @pd_langford for their awesome contributions to @Drunken__Gaming! Appreciate your belief in the project &amp; help in getting it made! Keep it coming, let’s reach that goal! — https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z https://t.co/flj3wjQt15
@PBMom ❤️❤️❤️
I kid, I kid. #FirstHeadshot 😜 (Link in my bio!) https://t.co/wONh0CDryX
@PLoker Thank you!!!
@PBMom @Drunken__Gaming If you don’t want the perk, that’s okay. We appreciate the donation. And I’m happy to follow you for the additional $100!!! Lemme know. :)
@Buttercuperica @bonniegrrl There’s a perk for you to come play regardless. Check it out. ;)
@bonniegrrl @Buttercuperica It can happen! We just have to get fully funded. Spread the word and tell everyone you’ve ever met (and some you haven’t) 😜
@par995 @wilw Now THERE’s an idea, @wilw. You need to be on @Drunken__Gaming.
@alexfromfareast @CW_TheFlash @grantgust IIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNMN
Yeah. @HandmaidsTaleOnHulu. Great show. Not great before bed for dreams. 😕
#TBT - a photo I sent my rep when we first heard about @CW_TheFlash pilot and wanted to audition for it. 😁 Sometimes you gotta fight for what you want! That being said, I think @grantgust is A-MAZING on it. https://t.co/CTFmbz3aAl
It’s Thursday! That means #SGU #TBT over on my Instagram. :) Chickity-check it: https://t.co/yrnLMYPof5

Oooooo, what say you @TabletopDay? I’d love for you to be involved! ❤️ https://t.co/DVd5dgCH9S
@pd_langford @Drunken__Gaming Yay! Just to confirm - how much did you donate? I want to make sure I’m checking the record correctly! :)
@dan_boi91 @Drunken__Gaming Sorry, Dan, it doesn’t list your donation! What name did you donate under?
Opening this up to everyone now! The next 8 who contribute $100 or more get followed! And also the fun perk. And gratitude. And maybe also bacon. 😁 https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z @Drunken__Gaming https://t.co/qkGhMqFlKl
Oh hey there UK &amp; other time zones. This one’s for you! The next 10 people who donate $100 or more to @Drunken__Gaming will get a new follower. He’s nerdy. And funny. And... it’s me. I’LL follow you. 😜 —&gt; https://t.co/hqTopBwR9Z https://t.co/esDf5U2EHY
@reallycoolalias @Drunken__Gaming @America_Young says it’s in the works!
