@kayloveRays @michele617_ since we are still here,slower traffic(read going below the speed limit)move over. If you're going 10 over, don't.
Do FL drivers just make up "passing lane" rules? Why would the highway waste a lane for only passing?
What? There isn't a "passing lane" on the highway.  https://t.co/lCBric19o1
Sorry people, with kids in the car I'm 10/2 and not going any faster!
I don't understand why when driving on the highway at 75 mph in the left lane I'm getting dirty looks &amp; head shakes!I'm already lawbreaking!
Really fun to watch @Giancarlo818 launch last night. No surprise he made hitting the ball 500ft look easy! #createAplayer
@TBRaysTwins you guys do know that Wil isn't a Ray anymore, right?
Well, 2 things we know, @terrycrews is yoked and he can't hit a softball! Wait one more thing, he'd flatten me.

@TheVelvetFro but you're right. Service starts as you walk in. Parking...eh sometimes you can't help that.
@TheVelvetFro in some ways you are correct. I was using that as a crude example of some of the things Yelp reviewers dock pts for.
@ScottHoke1 solid show. This is a great lineup. Can't wait for Saturday! @mecum
Is there anything worse than a perpetual 3 star reviewer on Yelp? The one that always finds the hostess cause for deduction? #howsthefood

@jake_s_albright  @tim_cook well there you have it. #ApplePay is brilliant Mr.Cook and so are you.
Just used #ApplePay for the first time. Prob the coolest thing ever! @AppIeOfflciaI
This whole video post thing is KILLING me. Sorry people
Walk up high tee. Work to keep hands above and think get the foot down before the swing starts http://t.co/K0PWYsb7pf
@TBRaysTwins @DuckysTampa yea you should!
@jonjontza @newbalance @cncpts heard that! Silver 3M croc is so on point.
Btw everyone waiting on hitting videos, I am technically challenged and can't upload them for some reason. I'm using Echofon. Any ideas?
How do you NB? @newbalance x @cncpts 997 Rose. http://t.co/rlVdLEStDl
@Colding31 they won't be pearls but good baseballs that I hope will help out.
@Colding31 yes. Give me an address and I will send some.
@mstewy59_mark @DP813 thank you
@lakerb123 wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully I had a positive impact on him and your family.
@KMillar15 haha I'm just jealous that's all
@NoleLauren @DuckysTampa @GiioCRuuzz we have all of that!!
@DP813 if I see you there don't be afraid to remind me! I'll do that for you no prob
Who's making this weekend an @DuckysTampa weekend? What can we do to have you share a night with us? @GiioCRuuzz #duckieselfies
Do you ever work?? RT @KMillar15: 186 yrd par 3 http://t.co/5sP9Z33bhG

Hope all my "Reading with the Rays" kids are gearing up for their summer reading program with me. I've done my winter reading.
@CoachCliman @TBLightning @Geraldini93 @KKiermaier39 that's right let's go bolts! Bring that cup back home
@_jessiw for Kevin
@_jessiw @KKiermaier39 Camon Kevin! Make it happen. She will be your fan for life.
Josh Gordon...smh. So talented!
@88_Coconut prob
Sorry all that are waiting on these videos. My phone is terrible. Time to upgrade to iPhone6!
@WallyRasmussen follow @SKLZ and look for our Get Baseball Strong series with EXOS founder Mark Verstegen
@DBullsclubbie done that drill for my daughter a few times!
@dwftigers93 no fielding sorry. But gotta use your legs to get yourself in position. Keep feet moving
I'll have to post a series of requested videos once I finish. Service not too good out here
@_JL6 just posted a tee video. It's loading
If you have a solo drill you'd like to see me do, now is your chance.
@Dmy53 agreed. We will all have to wonder now what could have been if #BeastMode got the rock 3 times. Prob putting ring #2 on.
@BrianJBuckley I still don't think that THAT was the point though.
@Ken_carson57 hahaha, you just never know!
@coachmalone13 hey man I hear ya! Just trying to shed light and be unbiased.
@therealjwebz not after he just ripped off a solid gain the previous play. He runs too hard!
If he completes the pick slant it's genius bc they are expecting the run. Success to the most well prepared is always resounding.
I should recant my tweet about running w Lynch there seeing as I'm an armchair QB too. Just sucks when it doesn't work.
What a finish
What!!!!! Pass when you have #BeastMode???
This is too much!
Glad we get to watch a meaningful second half of the Super Bowl this year.
@buddiesuoftsg @StuPercy5 @gmckegg14 nice!!!
Wow. It looks genius now! #stones

@tyler_venegas that's nice of him
Semi-ironic/pretty comical that behind Brady and Belichick "deflategate" interviews there is a Gillette sign w #flexball. üòè
@AlotHello yes sorry. A LOT! I see that is your sole purpose on this Earth, correcting alots to a lots. Seems worthwhile.
@OldSchoolBYU @Skiffer09 @rakoto10 correct. A swing that can be repeated is so important
@BrianSpoto biggest thing is not to pressure the kids to do something they aren't passionate about. Hopefully Nash loves baseball one day.
Dedication! RT @craveyjohnny: @Evan3Longoria @RealCJ10 and when you don't have half of one improvise http://t.co/LrqYGXg1Aa
@TugCowart will make his start to use his hands and hips not his legs and feet
@TugCowart start in the middle and work the tee around. Make sure he keeps the same foot pos, load and stride even when the tee is moved.
@Skiffer09 @rakoto10 consistently barrel the ball with backspin, hit the ball on a line not in the air, stay inside and behind ball...
@THISisKROD13 agree, need 2 people for that though
@Colding31 awesome! We gotta get them graduated to that next level @SKLZ tee!
@tonysimpsonpga lol hitting heaters is good too
Youth baseball players do yourselves a favor, hit off the tee...ALOT! There is no end to the benefits.
How will you reach your personal peak today? @redbullTPA @DuckysTampa Make forever start now. #Forevernow http://t.co/h8VhjSeW3c

@ShadyStevePoker great picture my man! Money is dirty you know.
@Scuba200ft @Kurtcorndog very cool!
Happy Birthday @MatthewBerryTMR. These days should be celebrated, no matter what the age! #cakeandicecream
Shout to @MatthewBerryTMR,  @Stephania_ESPN,Nate and Secret Squirrel.06010 can be proud they helped take another team to fantasy excellence!
@Whiskey_Hank @OBJ_3 @DezBryant he also played every game of the season.
@Whiskey_Hank @OBJ_3 and if you'd like my opinion, yes, I think Dez is better. Way better is a stretch. More physical for sure.
@Whiskey_Hank @OBJ_3 that has nothing to do with anything I said
@clundqui great player too.
Is @OBJ_3 the truth or what?! This man catches everything thrown his way.
@tonysimpsonpga really cool

@BigDwashko sick!! That pumped me up!
@jbb1003 I suppose you were a slightly below average player and that's why we don't have a chance to compete against each other anymore?
@jbb1003 @RaysBaseball haha oh thank you. I do worry about mine, apparently not at much as you worry about it tho!
Thank you to each and every @RaysBaseball fan for your support this yr. A bitter end will serve as motivation in 2015.

@3_Antonio_3 position player can't win a Cy, why should a pitcher be able to win both?
@3_Antonio_3 kershaw is amazing, Cy Young all day but I firmly believe that MVP should be reserved for position player.
@hockeyfan319 award isn't names most valuable playoff player
@LedApron my personal opinion, MVP should be reserved for everyday player. Cy Young is the MVP award for pitchers

@metsonmymind Don't be mad, I don't care if the guy is the president, just like watching soundless political apologies..thats all.

@thatdude_george man there u are! There is always one on the group! I'm glad you showed
I mean the guy is slouched all over the podium! And he may be in the running for the 2016 Presidency???
@MerrittKlein813 lol he switched parties?! I'm not political at all I just think it's great to watch!
Watching political TV, namely Gov Christie, without sound is the best! You can actually almost see the lies in his face.
