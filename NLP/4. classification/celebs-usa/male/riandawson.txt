@williamcparks your band is good! Just listened for a while on your soundcloud. Right on!!
@SalmanShaffi I hear you. I'd seen that before when it first started. No hate or bad feelings, fair debate. Goodnight mr salman.
@SalmanShaffi  I'm not ignoring anything, I am certainly aware. Once again, helping another charity doesn't negate that. I'm done with this
@SalmanShaffi disgusting and deplorable, there's no doubt. But helping another charity doesn't mean you're sleeping on other world issues.
@SalmanShaffi this will not make a difference. same thing happened in LA a few months ago, there will always be an excuse.
@SalmanShaffi @datmangolas how the hell is it being ignored? Most talked about news story this week. Tell me a tangible way to help
@williamcparks good point. The most popular things are the most hated.
@SalmanShaffi @datmangolas They've raised 13million this year, 1.2 million last year. It's been 3 weeks. Proof of awareness.
@datmangolas @SalmanShaffi yeah so what? It's still raising awareness, more so than these people complaining about it on twitter.
@Jaxinhall saw a tweet "it'd be nice if people stopped pouring ice and started paying attention to ferguson" how does one reflect the other?
Just because people are helping one cause, does not mean they don't care about another. they are not mutually exclusive.
So sick of people talking shit on the ice bucket challenge. I get it, it's goofy. But it's also helped raise OVER $13million for charity.

@alltimelowftagb no need for an apology.I just don't want to see people telling me to "shut the fick up". No hard feelings, just preference
@dontfgkngpanic @TheIronyOfJalex saying "shut the fuck up Rian" has nothing to do with liking/disliking any band. Disrespectful is all.
@alltimelowftagb 'why don't you shut the fuck up' is not an opinion. And if you're so done with our bullshit, why do you still follow us?
Happy boy. http://t.co/pnI9qgxkuv
Now! Let's have a great time playing some music at damn Comic Con!
Man. Shame on any of you who give one damn what another person likes musically. I love all sorts of music, and am proud of all of it.
