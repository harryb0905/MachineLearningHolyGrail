@MemphisAAF @TheShipyardSD is a lawsuit a source?
Exhibit in lawsuit shows that AAF originally planned to use XFL name &amp; purchase assets from WWE &amp; NBC for $50M.  AAF met with Vince McMahon and he decided to start league on his own.
In lawsuit against AAF and Charlie Ebersol, Robert Vanech -- who believed he had a "handshake agreement with Ebersol" said much of what he founded about the league was later credited to partner Bill Polian.
JUST IN: Charlie Ebersol and the new football league, the AAF, have been sued by Robert Vanech, who said it was his idea to come up with league and was entitled to 50% ownership.   Vanech says agreement with Ebersol was ignored, seeks $$ and wants his name part of its history.

@JBMcAdams 1. It was a press release, 2. I called the AAF on Saturday with Dundon. They didn‚Äôt respond.
BREAKING: After week one, the new football league, the AAF, essentially sold off the entire league to Carolina Hurricanes owner Tom Dundon. Dundon puts in $250 million.

@DonHarris4 Those guys I have. Tons of others.
@TyedUpAt24 San Antonio-San Diego?
If the quality of play continues for the AAF, they are going to have to move more of these games away from the planned streaming and onto CBS.
The NFL said they would cut down commercial time. It wasn‚Äôt a real effort. The money the TV networks make didn‚Äôt allow them much flexibility. You can tell what a real effort is tonight with these quick strike 30 second spots that then return to AAF broadcast.
Me Yesterday: I‚Äôll watch the first half and then give up for good on @TheAAF.   Me Tonight: Great first half. Be right back.
As a big college football fan, the amount of names that I‚Äôm hearing for the first time on this AAF game is astounding.
@AyeBernie @PeriwinkleRip I‚Äôm not speculating anything. He has major conflicts.
The key insight that @TheAAF had, which other failed leagues haven‚Äôt had, is that big names won‚Äôt matter if the quality of the game is better than the quality of the names.
Impressed that San Antonio @TheAAF team already has its owned canned beer in the stadium https://t.co/MC4vGakfaz
First quarter of the first @TheAAF game. Better than the first quarter of Super Bowl LIII.

@79befe4511f14a4 But LeBron isn‚Äôt anyone. He has attachments that makes his appearance and conversations at a college game more complicated.
@GuudNight_Moon He was already retired and he was tied to an agency.
@robinlundberg Bother me? This is exactly what I cover. The NBA has been interested in the relationship with LeBron and Klutch over the last couple weeks with the Anthony Davis talks.
@robinlundberg He‚Äôs #1. Potentially the greatest conflict of interest out there.
@jsdeckard @PRButcher Let‚Äôs go! @MattBarkley has my mouth watering.
@Prime_LeBron @robinlundberg Making ridiculous stretches like this is more harmful than helpful to the racial discussion in America today.
@robinlundberg It all depends on what the setup is with LeBron and that agency. There isn‚Äôt an NBA player closer to his agency than LeBron is.
@robinlundberg He can, but is he talking to Zion before or after?
Fine line between LeBron showing up at a Duke game and potentially recruiting for agency he is associated with Klutch. But Players Association, which regulates agents, would never say anything because James is #2 ranking player executive in union. https://t.co/dZr6M16Dyl

Here‚Äôs my math on Twitter premium services, @Jack. I believe this is conservative based on 16% of monthly active users paying small fees for premium services. Companies will pay way more than this to manage social more efficiently. It‚Äôs an extra $2.5 BILLION. https://t.co/eQsHueAWEK
So @jack, 16 percent say they would pay some money for Twitter premium services. At a very minimum, based on 321M Action users, this is worth more than $2 billion a year. You made a total of $3 billion in fiscal 2018! https://t.co/4N2U41J8Ls

Rams running back Todd Gurley has four pending trademark applications to "GURLEYWOOD."  He says he intends to sell merchandise using the name from jewelry to fanny packs to thongs &amp; g-strings.  First reported by @JoshGerben.
One sports book that had 1:50 on Gladys Knight National Anthem said her first brave ended at 1:49.5, but graded both sides a winner.
The Patriots filed for the trademark "Blitz For Six" two days after they won their 5th title in 2017.  They hope it doesn't mimic the jinx of 2008, when they filed for "Perfect Season" two weeks before losing to the Giants.  They still went through &amp; got the trademark. https://t.co/tze8X7QhkT
@ByTimReynolds Yes.

Bill Belichick's 1st NFL job was with the Colts in 1975 as coach's assistant. Made $25 a week, lived for free at a Howard Johnson's hotel.  Here's the 1975 team photo with coaching aide Billy Belichick in the white shirt in second row, first person on far left. https://t.co/KQcWUxSVM1
@LukeAllenFS I don't get paid to watch the game.
This would not be the first time there has been a controversy over the national anthem scoring.   Christina Aguilera also said "brave" twice.  It's now scored after the first "brave" ends.
JUST IN: There's controversy over the Gladys Knight national anthem.   One sportsbook graded the OVER as a win and then took it back.  Apparently, she might have said "BRAVE" twice.  First brave would have made it the UNDER. End of second brave would have made it the OVER.
It's almost as if these companies are TRYING to waste $5.4 million.
In 1992, Jared Goff's father Jerry was the backup catcher for the Montreal Expos.  He wasn't a star.   Three years later, the Expos drafted a catcher in the 18th round.  His name? Tom Brady. https://t.co/029lxNuKSh
@barryjanoff yes paid out 70/1.
The first public mention of "Super Bowl" came in the Kansas City Star in July 1966 from Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, whose kids played with the popular "Super Ball."  The name for the game wasn't trademarked until 1969 and wasn't fully adopted until 1970. https://t.co/DV6G5UFFgK
Aside from being tonight's referee John Parry makes additional cash being a motivational speaker.
Lesson: You can't bet on someone's national anthem time when the only good one from a singer is from 1991.
Unofficial National Anthem time on Gladys Knight is 2:01. Over wins.  Props that also paid off were WEARING A DRESS &amp; NO MIC STAND.
@austin_truex I think you'd better at setting those odds.

@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy What‚Äôs your real name? Where do you live? What do you do? Tell me about your perfect life.
@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy I‚Äôm so happy, bro. I use my real name. I use my real picture. People know where to find me. I stand by everything I say and do. You use you a fake name. A fake picture (or of one of your ancestors) and you hide behind it to try to generate fake outrage. It couldn‚Äôt be more clear.
@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy And I assume that‚Äôs the knockout blow?
@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy The greatest hypocrisy of all comes from a guy who is a keyboard warrior without a name attached to his handle with a picture of person (not him) talking about credibility.
@HLinsight My colleagues do plenty of that. You realize props in the last 3 years have become a huge business with $2,000 limits. 60% of Caesars money for this Super Bowl is on props. Oh you didn‚Äôt hear that?
@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy Your bio says you are ‚Äúcalling out hacks left and right.‚Äù I‚Äôd much prefer my life to be defined by how I‚Äôve lived it than by the way you define your sorry life. You‚Äôre nothing more than a know nothing troll who makes huge assumptions all to try to make a name.
@BigEasyLofton @_JalenJR Pretty great, right Big Easy?!
@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy You are so lost here dude. You‚Äôve never heard me present in front of people. How i change lives. I cover the business side for a gambling company that doesn‚Äôt even take bets.
Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that you can‚Äôt. That it‚Äôs not for you. That you have limitations. That it‚Äôs not the right way. Just believe. (üì∑ by @_JalenJR) https://t.co/4pWPEh28EE

@sumting16 @AllALittleCrazy How many days did you devote this year to getting in front of people to talk about mental health? I got at least 14. You, @sumting16?
@nicktwining Imagine being the guy who got blocked by me like Dikembe Mutombo. Oh wait....
Love what the #BellLetsTalk hashtag does once a year that we all tweet about paying attention to the conversation around mental health. Not enough. Until we realize that everyone is affected by mental health, designated days like this are just that #samehere @AllALittleCrazy.

@SteveBoyntonVT Why? Because I have my own confidence rankings that you aren‚Äôt aware of and I use units differently?
@HowTheProsDo If you truly wanted me to get something done, you would provide me with facts and treat me as a partner as so many have done over my 18 year career. But you troll me and taunt me and I honestly don‚Äôt feel like I want to deal with someone like that. Good luck.
@HowTheProsDo So this is our last conversation likely ever between us because you continue to troll. I didn‚Äôt disappear. The first one I‚Äôve been looking into. No one has been found the brothers guilty to the conclusion you suggest. 2. I covered the DraftKings one and it‚Äôs not over.
@jbach14 @HowTheProsDo Calling out is one thing. Many of these message board jockeys don‚Äôt finish the job. And sometimes there isn‚Äôt a job to be finished.
@HowTheProsDo Nope. You are asking me for accountability in front of my masses. I‚Äôm asking you for some accountability. See how that works?
@HowTheProsDo Also come out of the shadows and use your real name. That will also come a long way. You can say anything you want as HowTheProsDo. You can‚Äôt when you are a real person.
@HowTheProsDo So provide facts without daring people to report on them. Without trolling them. Without insulting them. Some of these facts like the DFS Brothers you mentioned have not seen the conclusion that you tell everyone has been reached.
@HowTheProsDo See this your problem. You provide information with a slant and an attitude. I publicly said on twitter if you can prove it I will do something about it. I‚Äôm an owner of this company. I care about this.
@HowTheProsDo Not true at all. Since you are an insider you are not understanding that inside baseball often isn‚Äôt interesting to the mainstream. You can‚Äôt understand that?
@HowTheProsDo What‚Äôs the point? You are accusing our people of deleting their picks and entering after the fact. The point is, if you had evidence, it‚Äôs a massive allegation, I would put an end to it.
@HowTheProsDo Yes believe it or not, yes. I have two responsibilities. One to cover journalism and one to cover things that people want to read. They aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.
@HowTheProsDo Give me examples please.
@HowTheProsDo I haven‚Äôt buried it. It hasn‚Äôt been my priority because others stories are worth more of my time. You‚Äôve decided that‚Äôs what I should cover. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.
@HowTheProsDo And did the New York Times discuss the controversy, finish it off and conclude it was fraud? And was DraftKings nailed on it? Because I didn‚Äôt see that story.
@al_terrific I have no idea what you are talking about.
@HowTheProsDo Actually that‚Äôs a fun narrative but it‚Äôs not true. I had the first statement from DraftKings.
@HowTheProsDo I‚Äôm a shill after I covered it the DraftKings debacle and FanDuel going down? You realize the ‚Äúcheating DFS Brothers‚Äù is a theory right? You realize what it takes to finish out that story responsibly? Oh. You actually don‚Äôt. Have a good day, bro.
@al_terrific @ActionNetworkHQ Huh? https://t.co/wOP8dmV8T4
@HowTheProsDo How are you a troll? Look at your timeline dude when you mention me. You are the very definition of it. You have provided me with tips, but it‚Äôs all baiting me, saying I‚Äôm not going to cover it. Now you call me a fraud because of my ‚Äúpicks.‚Äù Gotta bone up on your dictionary.
@ThaGreatZambino I‚Äôm not a tout. I don‚Äôt put out my picks. But they are easy to see in our app.
@HowTheProsDo 1. I use units as how confident I am. 2. I‚Äôm 21-21-2 on my bets. 3. I‚Äôm admittedly not a big time bettor nor to a claim to be. 4. I wasn‚Äôt hired for my gambling prowess. 5. You are massive troll. That‚Äôs the only obvious part of this dialogue.

One of biggest bets is a bettor who plunked down $500,000 at an @MGMRaceSports book on the over of 57 points for Saints-Rams. With 23 points in the first half, @ActionNetworkHQ app predicts that bet has less than a 35% chance of cashing.

@KEC913 @intothefray86 This is exactly why I put it out as soon as I could. The closer to the injury this is talked about the more effect it has on people.
A bettor had $210,000 on the Cowboys at a @MGMRaceSports book.   His $110,000 on Cowboys (-2) pushed.   His $100,000 on Cowboys (-2.5) lost.
A bettor at William Hill sports book at Monmouth Park bet $275,000 on the Cowboys.  He bet $110,000 on Dallas (-1.5) and won $100,000 on that.  He bet $110,000 on Dallas (-2) and pushed.  He bet $55,000 on Dallas (-2.5) and lost his $55,000.  So the $275K bet won him $45K.

Big development in New York as the Oneida tribe has struck a deal with Caesars to run their sportsbooks at their 3 casinos (including Turning Stone) in NY when sports gambling in the state is legal. Tribal gaming is considered a major impediment to sports betting in many states.
@JDell1981 he says yes. and it was the right decision at the time.
This Day in 1977: Apple incorporates.   Steve Jobs &amp; Steve Wozniak are without their 3rd founder, Ronald Wayne, who sold out for $2,300 265 days before incorporation.  Wayne, 84, who would have been among the world's richest, lives in a mobile home &amp; collects social security. https://t.co/kfjR3nehmu
JUST IN: Caesars signs on as first ever official casino sponsor of the NFL. Since the NFL is still against sports gambling under current law which allows states to make their own decisions and legislation, deal does not include sports betting, daily fantasy or any data rights.

Ohio State against the spread was the most lopsided bet of the bowl season, according to @johnewing.   85% of the money at FanDuel was on Ohio State. 87% of the money at William Hill on the Buckeyes.  Opened as low as 4, but most money was lost as OSU wins by 5.
Best winning percentages, college football coaches (UPDATED):   1. Knute Rockne, ND, .881  2. Frank Leahy, ND &amp; BC, .864  3. Doyt Perry, Bowling Green, .855  4. Urban Meyer, Bowling Green, Utah, Florida, Ohio State, .854
Major money on the line here. Bettors had Washington as in between 5 and 7 point underdogs. As 5 points came late, a TD will wipe out most who took Ohio State to cover.

Two $1 million bonuses on the line over the next 30 minutes. Eric Weddle gets $1M if the Ravens win (Up 6 with 13:45 to go). Nick Foles gets $1M if he plays 33% of team‚Äôs plays on season and they get in playoffs. Injury has put that % in doubt.

@davidbix Do you think someone who was really marketable would have an endorsement deal outside of TEN Spring Water?
@davidbix @XavierSeabass @sigtauez188 She doesn‚Äôt have a single endorsement deal that she has promoted. Not one, David. Paige VanZant has 3, Joanna J has 5+. Just stop.
@XavierSeabass @davidbix @sigtauez188 Read Amanda‚Äôs comments about her own lack of marketability in her FloCombat story 13 months ago. Not much has changed.
@davidbix @sigtauez188 Because the UFC knows she isn‚Äôt marketable. When she fought Ronda the casual fan didn‚Äôt even know who Ronda was fighting!
@ActionNetworkHQ @BlackjackFletch @chadmillman tell my guy to put on a damn shirt.

@MMARising I never said it was her fault.  It what follows is the truth.
@DevonESawa Nope. She‚Äôs has enough fights. Isn‚Äôt worth a draw
@1114cole @cotillionaire I‚Äôve been covering the business of UFC since 2001.
@TombstoneStint Sorry the truth made you upset.
@robertjresq @PeteJolicoeur @Amanda_Leoa Yes, she‚Äôs not close to either of them
@cotillionaire Address the painful truth.
@PeteJolicoeur she's not in the ballpark of the others.
@JaydenDat no, Cyborg win more valuable than a rematch.
Between Rousey and Cyborg, Amanda Nunes has singlehandedly killed the most valuable women in the sport.  Brutally damaging to UFC.  Nunes  isn't in the same marketing ballpark as either of those two.
With tonight's win, Nick Saban becomes the first college coach to make $9 million ($9,025,000) in a season.  $7.5 million salary  $800,000 new contract incentive  $75,000 for SEC title game  $50,000 for winning title  $400,000 for CFP semifinal  $200,000 for tonight's win
There it is. Knees kill the potential over (80.5) and the cover (-15).

In the least competitive bowl season in history, we've now had:  12 games with a margin of victory of greater than 3 TD's.  6 of those games have been wins of more than 30 points.  2 of those games have been wins with a margin of victory of at least 40.
@MuggsyNoges No today was the first day they ever faced each other on the football field

@Recc40 @ActionNetworkHQ the question is, if your girlfriend's cat could have tweeted it, did it? I rest my case.
So much money came in on Notre Dame, to cover as an 11.5 point dog &amp; to win this game.  In fact, at the more 100 US sports books operated by William Hill, 79 percent of the money was on the Fighting Irish to cover.
Annual value of shoe &amp; apparel contract:  Notre Dame -- $10 million, Under Armour  Clemson -- $5.8 million, Nike

For as much pressure as being a college football coach is, and you can see it in a lot of guys, Dabo Swinney always look like he's "just having fun."

@MarkhamDown @stormb0401 Yeah, that‚Äôs extremely offensive.

@Chase52414202 @DonnieH52 Ok. Here‚Äôs your response. I‚Äôm the HEAD of the influencer alliance for @AllALittleCrazy, and have done eight presentations on mental health on college campuses in the last four months alone ü§îü§îü§î
@theREALbenORR Mental health isn‚Äôt a disease?
@thematthinrichs Hire? I gave hundreds of hours of my time. I wasn‚Äôt hired you buffoon.
@thematthinrichs So how do you explain that in November 2017, i became head of the influencer alliance for a mental health organization?
@sagesteele Problem is in many cases, addiction and mental health struggles are inextricable. They can‚Äôt be unlinked. By blaming addiction, he‚Äôs dismissing mental health connection. This is very complex, not to be described in a sound byte.
@thematthinrichs @sagesteele Before I started working with @AllALittleCrazy and mental health.
@markbrown1959 @Interpolyester You don‚Äôt choose to suffer from mental illness either.
@cwebb33 Mental health is brought on yourself? That‚Äôs an awful argument
@sagesteele Addiction and mental health go hand and hand. Not always but very often. Saying mental health isn‚Äôt cancer or Alzheimer‚Äôs is exactly the reason why people who are affected by mental health are scared to get help and why they turn to cope with things they get addicted to.
@Interpolyester Wow, you are digging yourself into a bad hole here dude
I did eight presentations across the country on mental health in the last four months with @AllALittleCrazy, plan on doing many more. Issue is you can‚Äôt capture mental health discussion in a sound byte or on Twitter. It‚Äôs going to be out of context because there‚Äôs so far to go. https://t.co/uIKsFq5TVW
@AJ_ThompsonJr Glad you can diagnosis what Josh Gordon has. How many times have you seen him, doc?
@cwebb33 He says that and then says it‚Äôs not cancer or Alzheimer‚Äôs. Mental health is exactly on par with that and can be just as threatening to one‚Äôs life.
@Interpolyester @sagesteele What? Why can‚Äôt his addiction be a coping mechanism to his mental health issues like millions of others.
@web After working with mental health, I now feel guilty about what i said about TO. I would not say the same things today.
@sagesteele I get accountability for your actions, but to dismiss mental illness as not being a disease is a rough take.

@HowTheProsDo @JaySam1k @chipotleaddict1 I just told you that I was willing to write a full story. But you say you have the goods and now you say you need help from others. Which is it?
@HowTheProsDo @JaySam1k @chipotleaddict1 Show me your full investigation and how this was proven. And I would be glad to expose it. Short of this, it‚Äôs just an allegation.
@HowTheProsDo @JaySam1k @chipotleaddict1 Ok. Do they enforce it with you and not with them. Rules get passed over all the time
@Zazmania Ok first ‚Äî sure it‚Äôs a tax write off. But the money is real. Secondly, are you saying that DK stops others and not them? Just saying it‚Äôs against the rules isn‚Äôt good enough.
@shanefromsd @B_Hammy84 @HowTheProsDo @JaySam1k @chipotleaddict1 So are you saying they stop other people? Because if they don‚Äôt what‚Äôs to stop everyone else from doing this?
@HowTheProsDo @JaySam1k @chipotleaddict1 Tell me the rules he breaks.
@Zazmania So you are saying he isn‚Äôt donating the money? What are you looking for then, his tax returns?

That‚Äôs the sum owed if they fired him without cause, which they would have to after investigation suspended him but absolved him of language that could terminate him https://t.co/8qap3y9AHc

Show me a scout who said in 2000 that this kid would run for 1,000 yards in the NFL and I‚Äôll call you a liar https://t.co/D3KfQlaKDK
@cfrelund @lil_eastbay Aw thanks. So proud of you!!!!
In what is most likely the most lopsided amount of money on any team at any sports book this season...  99 percent of the money at @superbookusa was on the Colts (to win by 3.5 to 4.5, depending on when you got it).  It wasn't as sure as bettors thought.  https://t.co/bx9jQj80E5
NFL rules committee next year should consider taking off a point if your TD celebration is particularly horrible.

@jewish_buddha No, it‚Äôs incredibly impressive. But it does not mean you won a championship
@Stuckey2 üòÇüëç
@Stuckey2 Thanks my brother. In the few hours since I‚Äôve been hired, I quickly found out from the Action Nation on the street that you are the dude with all the juice. Can‚Äôt wait to collaborate.
@MSemianczuk @Joey_Nedland Being undefeated doesn‚Äôt mean you are the national champion.
@Joey_Nedland Well they aren‚Äôt real national champions as defined by how the system works. That‚Äôs not of debate. That‚Äôs a fact. You can have a problem with the system, but you can dispute the result as long as the system is in place.
@bryan_nguyen Who said you aren‚Äôt going to claim a national title?
@Joey_Nedland They are Chris Farley air quotes meaning fake.
@BrunoGarrett1 They played an outstanding second half but did not win the game. Not satisfied, but extremely proud.
Pat Riley undoubtedly crossing his fingers for next year. Maybe UCF can Three-Peat its ‚ÄúNational Championship‚Äù and he can get the royalties. https://t.co/GcxWiYEntx
