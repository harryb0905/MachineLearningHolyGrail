Steve Jobs in 2007 introducing the iPhone: "Boy, have we patented it."   The jury said, "yes, you did."
Pretty devastating against Samsung.  The jury found that Samsung infringed on 6 of 7 patents.  #appsung
Still waiting on the jury.  #appsung
Judge: it's going to take awhile to read this verdict form. #appsung
Judge has entered the courtroom.  #appsung
the key question is whether the patents are valid--- question #11. #appsung
I thought it would be next week.  Good thing we kept our crew and satellite truck in place.  #appsung

Apple designer can't remember who makes the Playbook.
"We've been ripped off. It's plain to see." Apple designer, Christopher Stringer  "We were offended."
On original iphone:   It was the most beautiful of our designs. Sometimes don't realize it instantly.
History lesson on the iPhone. Many many prototypes.
Apple design team is very culturally diverse. That's on purpose to bring different cultural perspectives to their products.
Apple designers literally work around a kitchen table, according to Stringer.
Apple designer Christopher Stringer on the stand. Apple has 16 designers total. Samsung has a 1000 or more.
Samsung---showing an iPhone emailing photos. "That is cool technology. I admit it.  Samsung invented it."
Lawyers for both sides are the best of the best.  Both sides doing an excellent job.
Samsung: Nothing wrong with being inspired by someone else's design. Apple was inspired by Sony.
samsung--- company provides 20% of the iphone components
samsung says the whole industry was changing to flat,rectangular phones.
Samsung: Not infringment-- it's competition
"Samsung decided to simply copy every element of the iphone."
internal Samsung document--- according to apple lawyer:  "Hardware portion is easy to copy."
"It's easier to copy than innovate."
Lawyer:  Apple protected each of these inventions with patents
Apple lawyer: The phone that has changed phones forever.
apple attorney shows Samsung phones in 2006 and 2010.  "How did Samsung move from this to this?"

@stacy_lynnf all suffer because consumers don't want multiple boxes.
@stacy_lynnf Most consumers want fewer devices that can multi-task.  Less clutter and ultimately less $$$$.  Google TV/Apple TV/Roku/TIVO
@stacy_lynnf But would you buy a new one today or upgrade the ones you currently have?  My hunch is the answer is no.
@stacy_lynnf Few consumers buy TIVO's anymore.  As soon as DVR's became embedded in cable boxes, you didn't need to get one.
Flip Cam went the way of the TIVO.   Technology moves fast.  Standalone GPS units are the next units headed for the graveyard.
