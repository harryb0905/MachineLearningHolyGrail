@LukeDonald You should come on the @memberguest podcast with me and @Brendan_Steele and Mark and discuss with us! 😜
@LukeDonald In order to discuss the “issues,” I think we’d first want to discuss the “goals.” Is the goal to “grow the game?” If so, why? Is it to see more inclusion universally across age, race, sex, economic status? Are there other reasons?

Yep. Also very bizarre... it would be like a special player coming off the bench at the end of a soccer match to throw a ball through some unrelated shape to decide who wins the game. https://t.co/TUV3my7Hxl
Is there a more bizarre position in all of sports than being a kicker on an American football team? #honestquestion
@HunterMahan Review it
Hey @nfl ... maybe don’t even have refs on the field and just review everything... you’re welcome.

“Here’s my penalty for France dance... whoopty whoop!” -6yr old (She’s not really cheering for France, she’s just embracing rhyming)
@rogbennett That’s a move my kids do when they score left footed...
After Croatia goal, “Does he get 2 points for scoring with his left foot?” (Note: that’s a family rule that we play)
Immediately before the French goal... “Great chance (for) France.”
Some great quotes are coming out of my kids while watching #FRACRO ... “Hairdo Giroud”

To clarify, this is what the album means to me, not what it "means..." But I'm sure you already knew that. 🙏🏽
OML is my favorite creative endeavor I've ever been able to participate in. I'm excited for you to hear it. I hope it means something to you
To this day, I haven't been able to listen through the entire album without breaking down at least a little bit... (5 of ?)
It's simultaneously about my relationship with my daughters, and with struggling to deal with the passing of my mom (4 of ?)
For me, it reflects a lot in my life that is very meaningful, and close to my heart. (3 of ?)
Some will love it, some will hate it. For some it will be a joyful album, some will find it sad. Some will find both. (2 of ?)
My predictions for the album, "One More Light-"    It will mean different things to different people. (1 of ?)
My favorite is "One More Light." https://t.co/kLxOsIr1yZ

A mic rose out of the stage for Travolta to speak into, but Urban/Underwood's production consists of an early 2000's screen saver backdrop

@thehybridthings I'm hard to impress if someone is trying to impress me, but otherwise probably fairly easily. 👍🏽
@luciferandpuppy @therosko lots of assumptions being taken for granted in that answer
@JiishaaN haven't seen it yet, but I'm loving watching Martial. He seems to be the real deal
@therosko the same question addressed in many ways i.e. "What is the meaning of life," can be approached scientifically and philosophically
@therosko depends on your definition of "proven."
@therosko why do you assume that scientific and philosophical questions cannot be the same?
@therosko why is the universe so big

@JasonSobelESPN I already miss the "comments" section from TGC. I don't know what to do with all this positive feedback to your writing!
@aaronpauley @philipmanansala travel safely amigos. See you when you're back home!
Kindness is often misperceived as weakness. I think it probably has a lot more to do with confidence and strength.

Anyone else wondering how differently this game may have gone if Brazil had Neymar and Thiago Silva available?

2nd half... Would love to see Brazil bang in a couple quick goals and see what happens. They did it against the US a couple years ago!

Anyone who's just corrected 'dog' with 'hound,' do your research... Both names are used in the book and the show.

Last point of clarification: if you are on London time, it's 830PM tonight, and @zanelowe will play it.
Please tell @mikeshinoda that you already know what he's going to tweet if you follow me, because I'm always a few minutes ahead of him.
To clarify, that's 8:30PM tomorrow London time only if you are currently on LA time.

“@lpfmfan: lol, I'm watching a show called celebrity oops and if you were more famous you'd def make the show lmao.”  I would be a fixture.
Sometimes people assume that the word "sometimes" means "always."

I find it interesting when people have pics of musicians/actors/etc as their profile pics.

“@stephrc79: @phoenixlp Psh! All posers. I've been a fan of Ljnkjn Park since they were called Zero.”  They were called Zejo. Poser.
“@JessVinchi: @phoenixlp I'm a Ljnkjn Park fan!! you're a member of that band, is that right?”  You're thinking of Ljnkjn Prk, from Belgium.
“@MattHaronian: @phoenixlp @juliatownsend Their bassist is pretty cool.”  Their bass is all synth, and they don't have any nü-metal guitars.
“@JuliaTownsend: @phoenixlp what about Ljmkjm Pank? I heard they take things to a whole new level of bad”  They're actually pretty good.
“@caroleeone: @phoenixlp that totally explains it I would've done it too Linkjn Park sucks”  Ljnkjn Park sucks even more.
“@Jaz_Zombie: @phoenixlp Haha now question is was this person a Linkin Park fan?”  A member of Linkjn Park.

... So, no. I can't wish you a Happy Birthday. It just wouldn't be fair.
... That would be 236.11 hours of time spent sending out Birthday tweets. At 8hrs/day, that would be approximately 29.5 days of work...

Brazil beat the US 4-1... Looks like we (my mime troop) owe Brazil a show.
“@Fel_Linkin: @phoenixlp USA 0 X 3 Brazil.”  USA 15 - Brazil 1
If Brazil wins, we will come play a show in Brazil... If the US wins, Brazil has to come play a show for us.
“@lhaion: @phoenixlp but say something for brazilian fans...”  For Brazilian fans: you're going down. #probablynot
@hysterics30_LP not our show, not our rules.
“@murphyDR: USA x Brazil man!!! It´s going to start!!!”  Don't give me any updates... I'm watching it tomorrow. Brazil is going down!

“@sovanesa_: @phoenixlp Chester will be very angry with you if you keep talking like that about Mike”  Chester is my capstone.
“@Marcos_robb: @phoenixlp You should work more instead of talking bullshits on your twitter!”  Technically, this could be considered work.
“@loreehx: @phoenixlp You say it because mike, right?”  Mike is why I say everything... And anything. He is the wind beneath my wings.

“@jackhammer505: @phoenixlp Hey, you said bassists are smart!”  I guess it's all relative.
Having a twitter convo with @heydudeimadam through text reply and not realizing it's posting to everyone while #LIESGREEDMISERY premieres.
I might not be as smart as I look (interpret however you want!)
Like I would risk not having their 3D special on my computer/phone/iPad! DVDs scratch!
Almost. I'm a bit later. See you in Lisbon!

@TedStryker did you love my typo in being a smart ass about your typo? "likes" was not on purpose.
“@TedStryker: I think I'm the only one who likes the #KROQParytLine”  Stryker, no one likes to "paryt" likes you and me.

“@Marslaeufer: about 72 times, it's round about 75 seconds long... :D But u can do some remix and stuff + hook &amp; new verses :D”  Perfect.
“@m_shinoda: Also: "Pay Yo Respektz."”  Math wizards: how long is "Pay Yo Respektz," how many times do we need to play it for a 90 min show?
“@m_shinoda: Also: "Pay Yo Respektz."”  We should do a show where that's all we play. Who's up for that? Brazil?
“@LPAssociation: @phoenixlp Pay Yo Respektz. #LP2012”  An interesting idea...
@TalindaB hadn't thought of that handy use for the jacarzzi, but it's definitely another selling point!
“@sharni7X: @phoenixlp Rehearse 'Bubbles' from the LPU8 CD :)”  Winner!

Not only are you not blocked, I'm now following you @TedStryker
“@m_shinoda: Do you realize people can see your profile picture?”  Crap. That kinda sucks.

I'm not as passionate about leap year as those last few tweets might make me sound.
Leap year is not a "phenomenon," it's the result of an archaic calendar established before precise astronomical data was obtainable.
That's 360 extra minutes per year... Instead of leap year, I propose we add 1 minute to every day except 5 and get rid of February 29th.
The Earth takes 365.25 days to orbit the sun.

Happy birthday to @LinkinParkFans_  and the approximately 144 others of you whose birthday is today.

Just spelled upholstery correctly on first try. #whosaystwitterupdatesareboring
“@GiLb3r: why do famous people only answer other famous people on twitter?”- If I don't answer, does that make me famous, or you famous?
“@phenix1149: @phoenixlp how many hours do you practice in a day ??? :)”-Anywhere between 0-4 hours. 3 question marks and a happy face...
“@JtDalysSword: @phoenixlp *insert witty tweet that will make you want to reply here*” -nicely done...
@m_shinoda looks like Silver Lake.
I think 50% of the time maybe half of my twitter followers don't understand 100% of what I've written.
If I didn't already know I liked it, there's no way I'd want to eat something named "sour cream."

Looks like the stock market is having a pretty good sale.

@KandiMahan the next bachelor needs to be Ames... No question.
Studio pic of the day... Mike after decim8. http://t.co/UiY9aQd
What would everyone like to see a picture of from the studio today?
Just got decim8 at @infectionhum 's suggestion... Awesome app!
I need some good new apps... Suggestions?
A little taste... http://t.co/Iwiz6Oa

Loving the new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm... Larry David never disappoints.
So far, this is where my Angry Birds protest has taken me...  http://t.co/dJ5oyhF
In protest to Angry Birds, I bought the Boob Job app, which you can use to "enhance" photos...
I don't know why, but it upset me today that Angry Birds is still #1 in the app store...
And no, I'm not sharing.  http://instagr.am/p/IJIvN/

Incredible win for Japan in women's World Cup... Very classy, solid possession soccer.

The house Mike Shrine looking very artsy.  http://instagr.am/p/HrAcP/
France looked to be the better team for much of the first 80 minutes... Not so much in the last 10.
“@eduardolk: unfortunately the USA is champion .. as Brazil was the strongest! haha”- Brazil was skilled, but out of shape... Not prepared.
France better be ready! US vs France starting now...
“@Jswindon: @phoenixlp you are my hero! Greatest ginger alive!” - thank you sir.
Grillin'!!! http://instagr.am/p/HimGH/

Currently been awake for 27 hours straight and feel totally fine. #sleepisoverrated
@HunterMahan pics shot using the instagram app... You need to get it.
Did I mention that I watched @justinbieber 's movie on the flight home? @m_shinoda may have caught BieberFever just by sitting next to me.
@m_shinoda I swear I was just going to post the exact same pic.
@GiLb3r yes
“@slashstradlin: @m_shinoda when r u touring mars?”// If I were you, I would have asked about Uranus... Just a cooler planet... Literally.
“@GeriCyber: @phoenixlp Hey Phoenix &lt;3! VenezuelaWantsLinkinPark”// You should be addressing @m_shinoda  about that.
Just kidding... All "Tour here!" requests should be directed to @m_shinoda
Please kindly direct all "Hey, tour here!" mentions to @linkinpark. Contrary to popular (twitter) belief, I don't route tours.

Very cool pics! http://t.co/WhGE0IO
At Death Cab For Cutie show in Berlin... @m_shinoda and I are pumped!

“@aninhalp_: @phoenixlp You're going bald too!”// Hair is totally overrated.
“@LPUer4life: I think I saw some grey hair on @phoenixlp . lol It's OK Phi.”// It's supposed to make me look that much more distinguished!
"I got them something off their registry," and "I got them something on their registry," mean the same thing. #funwithenglishambiguity
“@mooniecow: @phoenixlp Can I pick you (for US Open)?”// I had to withdraw because of our touring schedule.
US Open starts today... I picked @HunterMahan, @westwoodlee, and Martin Kaymer... Good picks?
“@fffen: @phoenixlp you're not older than 2?”// I guess it's actually the last 2 rules I don't follow.
“@ichabourdonLPUX: @phoenixlp Phoenix! Come to Jakarta with @linkinpark ! I bet you won't go home! XD”// Threat?
Great set of rules I found posted at a playground in Paris. I never follow the last rule.  http://t.co/IfBUKOi

Looks like @m_shinoda is helping the cause! #unfollowphoenixlp
I'm done abusing twitter for today... If I were you I'd totally #unfollowphoenixlp
Final Secret: @m_shinoda wears a beard-wig.
Secret 2: @m_shinoda plans on writing a song for his 250,000th follower.
Secret 1: @m_shinoda has a blog. It's mikeshinoda.com! Don't tell ANYONE I told you it was his.
And I finally got @m_shinoda to stop following me... now I can tell you all his crazy secrets without him knowing.
44,420 now... that's kind of a funny number at least.
Now at 44,438... I'd be happy at 44,404.  34, and only 34 people, please unfollow.
Uh oh, too many unfollows, now at 44,441... this is harder than I thought it would be.
But now, someone needs to unfollow me please.
Congrats to @Denbudhisant... I think you are the 44,445th!
Just noticed I have 44,444 followers... Such a cool number, no new followers please!
@JasonSobelGC I love that people are attacking you personally for your TW article... I agree with the article, and I think TW would too.
Local high-schooler qualifies for the US Open... Best of luck Beau! http://t.co/63BKKCo
@m_shinoda Amazing. And, you have too much time on your hands!
Just finished our rehearsals for our next tour... Who's coming?
@Coach_Davies no time soon unfortunately... Heading to Europe next week for tour. Tell Foley I miss him.
“@mrsshellk: @phoenixlp Its football :)” PX- The word "soccer" comes from the british to distinguish from rugby. We learned it from you!
Messi is amazing. Soccer is not supposed to be a game that can be dominated by 1 player.
@JasonSobelGC I heard "Jason Sobel" was Italian for "putting yips."
@cqrlos chicharito!
“@naalinna: @phoenixlp what's your choice? MU or BARCA” PX- Pulling for ManU. #letthetrashtalkbegin
Seems to be some confusion in twitland... We are lucky to have Brad Delson using email (on occasion), he does not use twitter.
Loved it (but wish I hadn't seen so many of the jokes in the promos). #Hangover2
Hangover 2 tonight... Expecting greatness!
Little video of my Haiti trip with @MusicForRelief and @unfoundation 15 months after the earthquake. Watch now http://t.co/CRIczxv
@HunterMahan I'm seeing it tonight... You in?
Totally didn't get raptured today.
“@HunterMahan: All music sounds better on record players! Even bass players sound better on vinyl!” PX- You're growing wiser with age.
Preliminary suspect was the Rottweiler. After final autopsy, I believe the victim broke his tooth and bled to death from mouth. #rataccident
Today's first task: clean up dead bloody rat in garage. Shaping up to be an awesome Wednesday.  http://t.co/MEd2EKH
“@JessiCack78: @phoenixlp do you pick the q's you answer based on how clever you think ur answer makes you sound?” PX- But of course.
“@Milica_Shinoda: @phoenixlp how many people have you blocked till now?” PX- I've blocked all of Gaga's 10 million followers.
“@Coookiess: @phoenixlp what do you hope to gain from your Q&A?” PX- an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment and well-being.
3. Rampage Jackson is fighting in 2 weeks and is apparently working out at the 24-Hour Fitness by my house... That can't be good.
2. Bob's Burgers is a great new show... If you think it's funny, then we'd probably get along just fine.
Couple things for you: 1. We listened through a ton of our new music today (in rough form), and I'm very excited about it.
“@grayLP: @phoenixlp Am I late for your Q&A?” PX- No... I just pause for hours at a time.
“@Tessa_lp: @phoenixlp What's wrong with you?” PX- Currently?
“@betty_108: @phoenixlp How's bejeweled coming along? You still kicking ass?” I'm on Bookworm now... 23 mill and counting.
“@BenMcCaslin: @phoenixlp How do you handle high pressure (high heart rate) situations on the golf course?!” Read the book (out soon)!
“@tz_ink: @phoenixlp Nice avatar. Whoever made that must have been really amazing. And good looking. And smart.” Agreed
“@MissAssembled: @phoenixlp I'd love to know your thoughts on your Haiti visit.” Haiti is an awesome place that needs a lot of love.
I haven't done a Q&A in a while... (warning: you might get singled out/made fun of/pwned)
Paul Simon was great on Saturday Night Live this weekend... Quirky, but cool! http://t.co/bCYnOgb
@JasonSobelGC @justinrose99 that looks so disappointingly low tech. Jason, is that your cubicle with duct tape?
@tz_ink we're working on it!
“@Demonliberty: @phoenixlp hey how can I get your autograph?" PX- you could probably find it on eBay for less than $1... Or a meet and greet
Instantly realized that my last tweet makes it sound like I knew him... I didn't. Just watching Hypnotize video, and he's awesome.
I miss Notorious B.I.G.
“@ChesterBe: Rajon Rondo has officially made my lifetime MVP award! Inspiring!!” px- Go Celtics!
How come no one is tweeting about the Lakers @m_shinoda  @HunterMahan ?
@HunterMahan I'm fighting with the wedge-shanks... Can I get a RT?
@mpaulafarfan si, como no.
“@RSheartGOP: @phoenixlp good grasp on why you make $!   Doushe” PX- good grasp on spelling
Me: "You're blocked."
Twitter follower: "I'm going to tweet you 30+ times asking for you to reply to me and I'm going to number all the tweets successively."
AT&T: "Signal strength and phone service is deteriorating, but at least data speeds seem to be slowing down." #wishtheyhada10yearcontract
My favorite thing about AT&T service is how it progressively gets worse and worse. #goingbackwardsiscool
Dear @gasprices, you're way too high right now.
If only I could tweet with a British accent, then whatever I wrote would sound (read) classy.
Sometimes I wish I could talk trash on certain musics/bands and still be classy.
“@HamiltonPorter1 im gonna get me some ping irons, all because of @HunterMahan 's commercial” PX- last year's commercial made me buy hotdogs
“@JiggerJay: @phoenixlp who you calling for the fight?” GSP is my guy, but I think he'll have his hands full with Shields...
HUGE fight week... Couldn't be more excited for GSP vs Shields. @danawhite
7. Seven-eleven, seven-eleven, seven even backdoor little Joe.
6. I like abusing twitter on occasion.
5. I had a turkey burger for dinner
4. I need a haircut
3. Digiorno now has frozen pizzas that also come with frozen cookies... Haven't decided if that's awesome or disgusting... Prob both.
2. Lindsay Lohan is well on her way to having more prison-cred.
Updates: 1. Fuse has a top-20 best video countdown where they only play approx 1 minute of each song... At least they're playing videos
@ApolisGlobal are you over there solo? The pics have been awesome!
Tonight: Mumford and Sons at the Santa Barbara Bowl... Loudest girl EVER can't stop screaming "Whoooooooooo Mumford!"

Pictures (and video) from Haiti trip coming soon... Must sleep first!
Ongoing relief efforts in Haiti... Please  check out downloadtodonate.org or musicforrelief.org today!
Just landed in LA after a great (albeit quick!) trip to Haiti... Cannot emphasize enough how amazing the Haitians were to be around!
Little slice of heaven... Nice airport restaurant with this kind of coffee selection!  http://t.co/J72hl65
@Verddinhu thanks! You can help too...
Leaving for Haiti tomorrow... Very excited to see the work MusicForRelief has done in conjunction with the UN and Habitat for Humanity.
362 days until the Masters!
@m_shinoda What's worse... "#fail," or this guy :b with this written next to it... "pfffft?" Someone hit me with one of those!
#fail is the twitter equivalent of the 2 Legit 2 Quit hand-sign dance. #hammertime
“@autumn_93: @phoenixlp jeezus. so blunt about that Phoenix. haha. but I still use #fail and I'M still #cool. sooo :p”--- #nope
If you're still using #fail to seem #cool you are a #wanker. #truth
@mkenno33 better chance for the Aussies with Appleby
“@NephthysPhoenix: @phoenixlp I rather hear your thoughts on UFC at the end of april.” GSP is the obvious pick.
Masters starts tomorrow... Who's excited?  Predictions?
Remind me to never buy stock in Delta.
Some SERIOUS magic in the studio today brought in by @joehahnlp!
Huge thanks to @huntermahan and @kandimahan for the hookup! http://t.co/ujBlf9t
The best sports week of the year begins today. #masters
@JasonSobel I'll be there tomorrow night... when are we hanging?
When I get to 1,000,000 followers I'm going to give away a ton of @m_shinoda 's stuff! RT to win...
If you don't want me to like your children, dress them in USC gear.
Today, I will answer everyone's questions, wish happy birthday to anyone who asks, and play a show in everyone's home country.
1 week until the Masters. Get excited. And if you don't know, now you know.
If my hair went on tour, would you come? http://t.co/X7aufti
Test drove the tesla roadster yesterday... Fully electric car, 0-60 in 3.6 seconds, 300 mile range... The future!
“@JennyJohnsonHi5: Fox News is like Yo Gabba Gabba! for old white people.” So true!
@HunterMahan all my bass lines will be about you
Back in the studio today... Very exciting.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
My friend @huntermahan just said if you follow him and he gets over 50k followers soon, he'll give you a car (or something like that).
@HunterMahan A car?
The people of Japan have demonstrated that respect, honor, and civility can survive in the face of disaster... Very inspiring.
@SethMacFarlane Nicholas Cage?
Arco gas stations still don't accept credit cards? #its2011
“@m_shinoda: MFR T-Shirts To Benefit Japan http://t.co/ptGCbDo” Please check it out!
Saddened to wake up to the earthquake/tsunami that has hit Japan... Praying for those affected.
I just watched 30 seconds of Fox News at 10... That was plenty.
“@FuriousMantis: @phoenixlp You should follow me instead, I'm way cooler” Ok. Following you now, don't let me down!
Officially, completely, and utterly bored with the @charliesheen. #unfollowed
@BenMcCaslin just saw your message... I tried the hat on the course 2 days after we played and only made it through 2 shots... Too big!
Something inside me tells me it's not a good idea to buy a groupon for a flight lesson.
@danawhite I want to see Nick Diaz v GSP
@Coach_Davies you should have let me borrow yours.
I wore the tie for you in Dallas... Couldn't pull off any chaps in time for Houston, but the hat came together! @HunterMahan
Cowboy Up Houston! http://t.co/yU7hnrS
#Winsday nights show in Dallas will be brought to you by #tigersblood and #warlocktime... And, of course,  @charliesheen
Now following @charliesheen... Easiest decision I've made all week.
Watching "Minute to Win It" makes me feel like I'm getting dumber. That show now joins Carrot Top on my naughty list.
I was going to correct my math to be  -34%, but I'm too tired.
“@ClarkedyClarke: It's been decided: @phoenixlp is my favourite. He looks badass 134% of the time.” What about the other -66%?
Great day doing the town hall meeting today with facebook and the UN discussing Haiti. Get involved! downloadtodonate.org musicforrelief.org
@JasonSobel Tell Sean that I told you to ask him about hip-hop and see what happens
The name "Cheesecake Factory" is gross enough. But their Bistro Shrimp Pasta is obscene! 2,720 cals, 78g saturated fat, 1737mg sodium.
Check your listings for tonight! #LinkinParkOnFuse Trend it por favor
1.  Is that really necessary? 2.  If I do try it, does that disclaimer really indemnify them from anything?
...the whole time, it says in small writing, "professional driver, do not attempt."
I just saw a commercial where a high tech helicopter flys up and harpoon-suction cups a driving car, then flies off with it...
I need suggestions for a good book. #noteenvampires
Confession time... I finally finished watching the Grammy's, and all it did was make me wish I had more Bachelor on DVR.
John Mayer will henceforth only answer to Captain Jack Sparrow.
@HunterMahan definitely.
And Gwenyth.
Cee lo was great too...
Mumford and Sons just saved the Grammy's for me.
@JasonSobel at some point you HAVE to make fun of the Ricky Barnes/Wilson commercial... It's killing me.
... And yes, I'm in NYC and it's 4:30 AM.
Two huge things need to happen today... 1. @chesterbe needs to start feeling better, and 2. @m_Shinoda needs to have a great birthday!
It's amazing how bad AT&T is in NYC... borderline unbearable.
Thank you for all the birthday wishes. In honor of this special day you are all granted permission to leave work/school early today. Enjoy.
@brianonghomes what is that profile pic?
Just checked the weather at home (77 degrees)... Currently hating all my friends/family who are there while I'm not.
@JasonSobel prob only because you don't have a 3D TV.

@debbiepharris what up Deb? Say hi to Pat for me!
A huge thank you to everyone who's been reminding me that my birthday is approaching... What would I do without you!?!
Ummm... this is awesome. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1STxCE8uj3U&feature=player_embedded
@HunterMahan where's my golden putter?
“@SethMacFarlane: Why would someone put “Life Coach” on his business card when “Tool” takes so much less space?”--- PX: amazing
“@HunterMahan: @phoenixlp no chance” Care to make a friendly wager?
Who cares about the review... The picture is of the bass player! (cont) http://tl.gd/8gdion
Didn't make it, but a solid effort... 2 miles in 12:40... I'll break through the 12 soon.
Going old school on the workout today... Going to see if I can run a "Cooper." (2 miles in under 12 minutes$
Wisdom for today: a Snuggie is a backwards bathrobe.
If you have no idea what I'm talking about, consider yourself lucky... Among other "services," you can get your doll's hair did for $20.
I'm in the American Girl doll store for the first time... I never knew this world existed.
@slipknotaddict8 glad you liked it.
“@DenzelRequiem: @phoenixlp hello phoenix!! Can you reply this mention???” PX-nope
According to Bookworm, "nope" is not a word... Really?
Lots of curiosity from you guys about the eggs... Scrambled egg whites with tabasco, turkey bacon, fruit bowl, coffee. Very paleo (HA!)
4.  I had eggs for breakfast.
3. Tiger Woods is now 3rd in the official world golf rankings... Just thought that was newsworthy.
2. (cont'd) it'd have to be a big shoebox, but you get the idea!
2. Lots of new music being worked on. Yesterday, @m_Shinoda and I are writing on a new recording rig that could fit in a shoebox!
Update anyone?... 1.  US tour is off to a great start, and I love the bands touring with us (Does it Offend You Yeah, and Pendulum)...
@JasonSobel If a fan catches me making a mistake on bass, I don't get paid that night... Musicians and golfers totally have that in common!
...but I was serious about the back and sleep thing.
#tryingtofeellocalinflorida
I just can't read street sign like I used too...
My arthritis is starting to flare...
Out of all the crazy/stupid things I do in life, it's sleeping that makes my back hurt the most...
@GiulianaRancic Nice flying and talking with you this evening!
This is not supposed to be a @RVCA or @Tabasco ad, it's an ad for my new iPhone kickstand. http://yfrog.com/gzfrytj
“@plainwendyjane: @phoenixlp I think the real question is who ISNT @linkinpark?”-- Or, what does "who" mean?
“@LPcatitoRJA: @phoenixlp isn't that the band with the bald bass player?”-- No, that's Daughtry
Who really is @linkinpark?
I'm bummed that they don't show the girls ages anymore on the Bachelor... Is that weird?
Can't decide whether I love the shirt, or if I should make fun of it...
Just saw a guy at the airport wearing a shirt that says "I'm right 97% of the time. Who cares about the other 4%."
Congrats @kandimahan and @huntermahan... Fantastic wedding!
“@fallenaddict: @phoenixlp  Please RT I NEED OF 2 TICKETS FOR YOUR SHOW AT  THE  MADISON SQUARE GARDEN” PX- this person apparently needs tix
“@GiLb3r: @m_shinoda you sound like @phoenixlp on ur last two tweets :P”-PX- You mean Mike sounded like a genius?!?
TGIFF
Contrary to the opinion of some, Orange County USC fans don't cheer for Oregon because of PAC-10 ties... It's because they're frontrunners.
3. A bit of a winter cold with congestion makes diaper changing more pleasant.
2. Former Orange County die-hard USC fans are now apparently die-hard flag flying Oregon fans
A couple quick updates... 1. Non-dairy chocolate chips taste the same as regular.
@HunterMahan We should both just do handle bar mustaches.
“@florencebelo: best bass players in the world @phoenixlp and @estebantavares”-- I'm a lot less pixellated than him
“@araphaxdeep: @phoenixlp I'm using one of your twitter quotes in my company Jan. newsletter, hope that's ok.”--Quote away!
Finally! RT @JasonSobel: Very cool news to report: EA Sports & Augusta to include the course in the next edition of Tiger Woods' video game.

2010 is for pansies.
2010 is sooooo last year.
@m_shinoda So THAT'S why every time I see Usher at your house he tells me he's "just hanging at the club."
According to Usher's lyrics, he is spending a TON of time dancing in the club... I call B.S. On that.
My rank in Bookworm is now "Bookworm." 1 million points and counting...
Saw The Fighter tonight... Great movie! But why no Marky Mark & Funky Bunch in the soundtrack?... Would have fit the time period perfectly!
“@Loganpat97: @phoenixlp yeah @HunterMahan responds to every question kinda like you do huh?”--- Yes
And he LOVES questions about bass, bass playing, bass strings, bass fishing, etc. @huntermahan
He also told me that he responds to every question tweeted to him... @huntermahan
This guy plays golf a bit better than me... Follow my friend @huntermahan
