The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is what I imagine limbo feels like
Whoever made today #NationalCakeDay doesn't know I'm still full from #Thanksgiving
There are 2 types of people who celebrate #CyberMondays: The ones who shop the best deals online, and those who spend the day deleting promo emails.

There are two types of #Thanksgiving dinners – one that starts in the afternoon, and one that starts at normal dinner time. Which one are you?
We often times forget that we have so much to be thankful for. Happy #Thanksgiving everyone! Hope you are spending today surrounded by people you love :)
Being solo on #Thanksgiving doesn’t have to be tough. Tomorrow when  relatives ask, just say you’re happily single but will gladly accept holiday presents for 2.
