you are correct. https://t.co/KCRfYqdulh

I don't want to see our first line of defense weakened over politics...which is largely has. At some point it needs to stop. More coming on this as I get it.
It has to do with our military and what our men and women are asked to do and Monday morning quarterbacking isn't the way to ensure success. This collision between war and Main Street where most people have no idea of the sacrifice and danger...is one I fear. https://t.co/Zbw6ZYqwFj
Kill, capture, or disrupt....this is going to be an important narrative in the coming days. Stay tuned.
@ChelseaFC at home against ManU in the #FACup so let’s go Blues!! @CFCInAmerica @LAChelseaBlues

@texasgal100 LOL
Thank you. I truly am an issue guy and have no horse in the game. Just want us to use common sense, critical thinking and get better https://t.co/m0fTMAGBLf
Just finished cooking an amazing salmon dinner and a bottle of @ChMontelena Chard   Aaaaaaaaah
Hahahahahahahahaha https://t.co/PQ3p62JPfJ
And it’s not the opinion shows...they e been in primtime for years, it’s the loss of all the other news and news hours https://t.co/iLXwUFkWx3

LOL and I’ll tell Tam hey :) https://t.co/iigTG2n7TC
Thank you https://t.co/VKNQgCOz0b
I truly just wish we could have honest debate and not make our opposition our enemy. Somehow, some way...we gotta get back to that. https://t.co/fkMaoiaaCq
Thanks :) https://t.co/ZYdZAlC4pq
We were all over #Nicaragua and had the first and exclusive interview with Daniel Ortega...I worked on that one for 5 months...the saw the amazing work being done by the DEA. This is how I remember the remote islands off of Bluefields https://t.co/uBVgj6Cgp8
Watching @ChasingMonsters in Nicaragua and reminded of our amazing trip there working with the DEA as they hunted drug running. Miss when news as a whole was proactive. By the way, kids love the show and Nicaragua was gorgeous.
Crotical thinking and truly disconnecting from party. That’s what’s needed.
I took that step 5 months ago. Let freedom ring. :) https://t.co/4eeyRqnSN8
LOL https://t.co/iKWv4JaDNp
To a much better life https://t.co/4hVzVVKe4c
We answered all that in the exclusive report I presented. No doubt a flyover was easily attainable without midair. Also...again...nobody was repositioned with any likelihood of response. We didn’t know this was going to be over in 13 hours until it ended. https://t.co/0TVf63fb4N
I think some truths will still come out, but will anyone care? They should. https://t.co/EkbRl1puyC
Yep. Theories and strong ideas https://t.co/7dOphZiCAg
As a reminder I also reported that our special ops tracked down at least 20 main suspects and yet only one has been prosecuted and he was “low hanging fruit”. Why wasn’t anyone hunted down and held accountable?
And the fact that we didn’t know when this would end and units weren’t staged and an extraction plan was never in place. https://t.co/ofOLzoov1n
Bingo https://t.co/3sI9OYwPVW
Not at all https://t.co/R16ozUxASS
I never argued anything you’ve just said. Look at my reporting on all of it if you get the chance. What I said was we did nothing. We could have done some things, that isn’t even debatable. https://t.co/W07LxMF4ef
Bingo. It was before Trump ever ran. https://t.co/cXnHJPwqCw
The airmen who interviewed exclusively and the House Intell never found will tell you they were in plane and ready within 45 mins of attack and sat there for hours and hours. https://t.co/IUpqKQt0PN
You are correct. We are talking snout two completely different things. Those guys take time. But what could have been done wasn’t. And nose guys weren’t even positioned. This was a multiple F up. Period. https://t.co/uKCWbsPGEA
@mark35806 I reported what I could.
And they weren’t the only ones https://t.co/G50oyTHB6O
I never said CIF you took. I said we had jets in position that could respond and were ready for hours and after 23 hours we didn’t put one body or plane on the ground to rescue or extract. To say we couldn’t do either...is complete bull crap and I know it https://t.co/N6XDNnY1Dl
Your dismissal of facts isn’t magic, but clear indication of your bias and insincerity. Go troll somewhere else. #donewithyourcrap https://t.co/Mal5h4lLTh
So you’ve already gone back on your first argument. Now realize that we didn’t even pull anyone out. The Libyans...LOL...we relied on the Libyans and a rented jet to get our people out. If you did any research, then you’d already know that. https://t.co/h4BfAm9Aep
@rgajr13 @amafera @CoachTimHall Never shown one of my baseball cards ever on TV.
Because I reported it https://t.co/l0GUORRnT1
Not a bad idea! https://t.co/8jVE1Pzbev
It’s simple really. On the shores of the Med. I have interviews with pilots and others who were there, unlike you, and they tell me otherwise. Including tactics and times. Sooooo keep your head in the sand, that solves everything https://t.co/r4kT6S1Vec
Gowdy didn’t do it right either https://t.co/qzC3tQXWQw
It’s a good group...clearly https://t.co/JO2CR5PzS3

Lol. Keep avoiding the truth and live in your partisan world https://t.co/w0Z0Rbj3ha
Imagine if they had done it correctly once and actually did more than aim for just Hillary. https://t.co/1E1vI7iprh
Yep. Too many politicians on both sides have turned this into a lifelong job and thus lost touch. Term limits at all levels are a necessity https://t.co/jQ0WZWximQ
Thank you. I don’t know. If we and enough of we demand it...then yes. https://t.co/FhbJLsN2LE
Oil https://t.co/ooRYlQuDWJ
Remind them to talk to me. Im fair. Honest. Have no horse in this game. Just want us as a country and society to get better and succeed. We are the best hope. Not perfect by any stretch. https://t.co/36qivwX7Fy
No conservatives got lucky. Look at how they’ve handled their own. Johnson in Wisconsin for example and how McConnell bailed on him thinking he was going to lose. https://t.co/PNB5iqGf7i
Always https://t.co/69c5W3IClT
It’s like we don’t want to know unless it benefits us. That’s sad.
For example...Libya..still nobody has done any meaningful background. Why did we oust a dictator after he came in line? Makes no sense. Ended ul@with Benghazi. I’m sorry you’re telling me we can’t get anyone on the ground in 13 hours?! Yep...makes no sense.
We’ve also lost our sensibility and just our sense. Many or so quick to judge and blame that they fail to look at the common sense of things. I’ve always been told 99% of everything can be answered by who benefits most
More of my notes on all this coming soon. I was seriously discussing a new wine blend when all this got me annoyed. So much not being reported and missed for a variety of reasons. Politics. Ignorance. Laziness. Indifference.
You must all realize this corruption and ignorance, cause it’s both, encompasses both parties. Not being a centrist, just saying the right has a ton of issues as well
and the media primarily only cares about stoking the fire. We don't show good news. We aren't proactive. We don't truly care. I'm clearly generalizing, but it's the truth and all of you know it. Now back to making wine.
But we don't care about details. All we care about is finding the info that is going to bolster our side. Whatever that side may be. That must change. It should bother you that we have both parties who've completely lost touch.
I'm told Mike Flynn got into their crosshairs not because he chanted "lock her up!" but because he stuck up for a damn good female agent who internally targeted I believe back in 2012. Again...just a little research would find these details
This was waaaaaay before Trump. Investigative people out there, which nowadays is all of us...need to ask the questions. Find the people. Hear about the agents who did amazing work, but got messed over when they didn't "fall in line"
Yes he knew stuff was going on, but his #1 was usually image. Then the folks below him like McCabe ran the show the way they wanted. If you didn't play their game and do it their way, they took you out. Bankrupted you.
So it ran like this. Comey was called a "bag carrier" meaning for years he carried the bags for FBI leadership. So once he got his shot to run the place and for someone else to carry the bags he took it..he was all about image and all about the Bureau and himself looking good. https://t.co/3vF9gqrqX1
Nothing...I'm just clarifying my position. I am here to report fact and truth, not to take one side or another and then find fact or truth to bolster that side. https://t.co/Z4SMZIk34y
And they have gotten no support from elected folks on both sides of the aisle. It's simple...nobody in DC cares unless its a quick easy headline. https://t.co/AukPKaMHfq
We lost a number of good men and women who were helping our country become safer. https://t.co/dvNxCVSdL4
And she speaks the truth https://t.co/AdB1J98KtU
Bingo. https://t.co/2cxKrqXB7O
He didn't know about all their meetings. He knew some stuff, but he also was purposely kept out of the loop. He defended them, but he was #1 about his image. I was told "James finally got the spotlight after always carrying everyone else's bags" Meaning other Directors https://t.co/iIl29jV8rx
Yep https://t.co/ydXQy69kxz
Yep. https://t.co/1k1M4wYOGg
@covfefe_u Nope....it’s called complete clarification because many on twitter have their eyes covered with froth from their insensibilities over any topic that’s controversial.
My horse in this race is our country. Truth and decency. I’ve signed on to no man or woman. Like many corporations, there are power plays and cliques. This one happened to be in an agency that ruined some people’s lives
Because everyone who cares is so divided and the media is at the very least ignorant, nobody is asking the deeper questions. Did 60 Mins ask how long these meetings had gone on?
What I am saying is that this was a power and control issue, kinda like unmasking. You didn’t play with them, you were targeted. Period. Agents know and they’ve seen how those who spoke out were treated and bankrupted
This group of people met without the Director knowing I am told and passed off the meetings as BBQ’s...when they were meetings all about control. Again, this started a while ago and targeted other agents who didn’t play their game
As everyone on my feed debates the McCabe interview. One reminder. I reported the FBI internal issues began well before Trump ran and McCabe had issues with agents who didn’t play his game. Not defending Trump, just saying there’s a ton more to this story.
Thank you 🙏 https://t.co/rIIYqqxsSv
And has she ever set foot in Venezuela? Has she ever spoken to people who have fled? Has she attempted to reach out to those still under the current brutality? I suspect not. Call it what it is. Maduro &amp;Chavez before him, shut down the media and jailed opposition #dictatorship https://t.co/5y62l5fc44

Like the commercials did https://t.co/kCeqNNtqXJ
For some elected folks in DC it isn’t that simple...which is pretty sad. https://t.co/83LEQAQ1rp
Never. Seen people have too@much wine and then it caused them to whine for more. Sad really. https://t.co/y3KMkTkn2O
It’s just completely ignorant to think the US shouldn’t pick a side in Venezuela. One is a socialist who has jailed opposition, shut down any free media &amp; basically continued the bankrupt and corrupt policies set up by Chavez. The other...isn’t. Simple decision #VenezuelaLibre
@sahouraxo @PrisonguardGino This is the problem with our foreign policy decision makers. It’s simple. We must do something to support because the Russians and Chinese are. Doesn’t mean military action. But something. To say we shouldn’t pick a side?! Ummm have you met anyone from Venezuela, been there?
Did Jasper eat it? https://t.co/sYIaHN3NsS
I did too and I ain’t as old as you. Maybe we should ask Alexa..I think she won tonight. https://t.co/3yDICiBPVs

@WhigsnTwigs Yes. So yes.
Meantime some LA man...I’m trying to be kinder...decides its ok to let three adult friends cut in front of a three year old girl saying “Daddy I gotta potty” and then he himself goes. It took every ounce of my frame to be kind on this one #completedouche
Big thanks to Michael, his team and people like my childhood friend David Graham for all of their support. We can all agree gun violence must stop. #alainasvoice #bekind #worktogether https://t.co/3L6zDFmTyj

Lol 🍷 https://t.co/O9fOm2qGW9
Exactly. See nationalization of major industry. See shutdown of any and all media opposition. See chasing away most, of not all, major corporations. See jailing of opposition. See currency manipulation. See insane corruption at the top of the food chain. Glad you see https://t.co/l3N0iDgCrd
Huh? This has nothing to do with the US. Do just a tad, just a little research. https://t.co/GsrrDc55rY

Yes...this is truth. Chavez set this guy up and set his country up for failure. https://t.co/a5snkZcNUn
@DianaDiab95 @CarolCATX Oh...and she and her propaganda crap are now officially blocked. Enjoy your freedoms..wherever you are.
This nutcase...likely working for someone...sticks up for Iran...a country that just hung a man because he was gay. Let that sink in. Talk about killing and torturing. The hypocrisy...at the very least...is more than real. https://t.co/A4NFzhYGDj
Their propaganda is just that and the report I just read that she cited is a complete joke that hangs itself entirely on the opinion of one...clearly misguided member of UN staff. No mention of the brutal leadership in Venezuela the last 19 years or so. https://t.co/s7SxSoq6mI

Agree https://t.co/WMkCTmpsv0
I am also told “once the repression starts, we have these young guys LA RESISTENCIA facing the national guard” #Venezuela #VenezuelaLibre
He continues “on tv they say auto proclaimed...thats not the reality, he has to assume the power and create the conditions for free elections” #Venezuela
From #Venezuela : “we are waiting fot the military, in the meanwhile, as i told you, there are riots in the poorest slums in Caracas and all over the country, for first time wich is a good thing. That is more than when you were here last time”
The media is all government controlled in #Venezuela and one of my friends who is very good and used to@make a normal salary is getting $6 a month. Buys nothing and everything is based on black market
She speaks truth. https://t.co/1XbPq3LSiO
I won’t watch. https://t.co/QoenDsDz56
@John_Frank1954 @JMichaelWaller More info coming shortly. Hold on.
Agree with some of this. We put our fingers in too many places. Sometimes warranted, but Teddy’s great white fleet and strength at home may be the best idea and we should follo it more https://t.co/9Y0NBemYQT
@kittreantanner Agree 🙏
Too to bottom...we haven’t had one in years. Like 30 https://t.co/5lfPNeIJby
My #venezuela contacts say they are very sad to see the Americans evacuate and forced to leave because outside of social media they can report what is happening. Another reason Maduro kicked them out. To control all messages out of country. https://t.co/xkdSYvWwHo
Last 36 hours https://t.co/xkdSYvWwHo
You know I would https://t.co/5SJmKms24G
Some military and police have switched sides against Maduro and I am told many more want to...waiting to ensure this time the regime won’t hold. Also nearly 400 arrested and all media controlled by government
26 people now dead in #Venezuela i am told media members who were shut down. They are solid in their reports and numbers and I know them first hand. Those dead were shot by police and military supporting Maduro
We are. Stellar Cellars is our distributor so they would know where to find us, or ask your local store/restaurant to bring us in. Thanks for the interest https://t.co/yj1ziloc6E

We need not be seen as the cause, because we aren’t. We also don’t need to be used as an excuse...so we’ve got to remain strong but on the edge. Hope he does that. https://t.co/CkZsjFOQT8
I like the idea of special envoys and always have. Abrams has interesting and sometimes completely opposite views. He can be hardline, but then again I like his push for human rights. Curious as to his Latin American views in this case. https://t.co/CkZsjFOQT8

What explains the previous 18 years of heartbreak in the country? I do agree there is a military complex and a government one as well, but it’s not always the answer or the cause. https://t.co/dMjtz3Xa35
Right? https://t.co/tZJMK7QAE7
@GonzaloMarginet We need to hang for sure
Clearly you allow undemocratic elections where opposition is jailed or disappears. https://t.co/cClIPL0HdR
Yep. They are. LOL. They are every day working people and you are completely misrepresenting the facts https://t.co/OugcY9HPpF
The problem was both and many times one in the same. Ask the folks who worked at the industries in Venezuela that were socialized. But you wouldn’t know that. https://t.co/z0gywetNIS
Wow. Incredible intellect with this one. Spoke by someone who likely has never been outside the country to any place other than a Sandals resort. https://t.co/g4OZyKYkMg
You don’t live there clearly https://t.co/yhLxIZysjD
Oh and I will agree that the US does stupid crap around the globe. Some amazing stuff and then some plain dumb stuff. If we just made decisions on what was the right thing to do...and if our leaders in both parties actually took the time to learn https://t.co/jmVyfouEYF
@HillaryGuess Yes because so much can fit in 280 characters. Let me simplify for you. Chavez sucked. Maduro sucked. They ripped apart their people and country with corruption. End of reporting. It’s called truth. You should try it.
This response is in response to those who claim U.S. support of Venezuelan opposition is all about oil. The U.S. is actually late in the game on this one. https://t.co/XSsEdSvroi
I’m in https://t.co/R2oU6PJQ59
As usual it all depends on whether the military brass stick with him https://t.co/Mau9DsM5H3
Massive Venezuelan demonstration at their embassy in Mexico City today also. https://t.co/RfUJ4kTYes
Will be covering it from here. I wonder if any US news outlets will go. We did in 07 when it got real bad. Not sure if it breaks through the everything Trump coverage I avoid now. Someone will have to let me know, I don’t watch em. https://t.co/sRsX8ADdSZ
Just learned two of my friends for out of Venezuela. Still waiting to hear from others. My closest friend hasn’t gotten to me yet. Very tense there to say the least. #VenezuelaLibre
Any time. Thanks for the questions. https://t.co/DakAeqpmb7
I hope you are right! https://t.co/aWKoFx5UI0
Been there too..but after those guys https://t.co/5lkmh1nxl4
Yes https://t.co/2ZWWmG7jPG
Thanks! I was there twice and have stayed in touch. Doing the same now #VenezuelaLibre https://t.co/Ga2R1bOq5A
Absolutely. But Maduro won’t do it. He wants attention but knows not to hurt a U.S. official. Chavez threatened to arrest me and in a national article said I was a threat to the Venezuelan people. That actually protected me, cause most hate the situation the last 15 years https://t.co/qUjrgVVVnn
So yes...I worry for my friends in Venezuela. My buddy Francisco was in my wedding. Good people who deserve better.
This is going to be bad in Venezuela I fear. Maduro and his followers are ruthless. The US should stay out..only support when the people make the change. https://t.co/vZcbkkyiQg
Ok...this guy and his propaganda is getting blocked. Nothing like complete faceless generalizations. Enjoy your life wherever you live. https://t.co/SKxdUpZpYr
The only people screaming the US caused this are not in Venezuela and never lived it. https://t.co/w653MvnrwK
We’ve always been interested. Do an article search. More than oil as seen by what we’ve been getting in recent years. https://t.co/WQmqtouxdu
Here we go. It’s their right, but stealing others property is not. Set all that aside...the China equipment failed miserably. Ask anyone in the industry. Oh wait you are part of the blame America crowd and could care less about facts. https://t.co/bIGTnVRSrr

First block in about 5 months.
LOL...cause I do. https://t.co/Fixf3tXnur
Not to say previous leaders weren’t corrupt, but Chavez took it to another level. I was there when he shut down the free press. https://t.co/jrNMGaVKyt
Then you know David that this has little to do with any American sanctions. Chavez was a madman who ruined industry and then made crap deals with China. Then jailed opposition and paid off and corrupted the elective system in the country. https://t.co/jrNMGaVKyt
That was a PR move and I was there when he did it. In Venezuela. Also he couldn’t provide heat for his own people. Stop your lame attempts at defending a madman. Close to being blocked. Such trash propaganda you are spewing. https://t.co/KqjPeUYuyT
You don’t want to challenge me on Venezuela. You will lose. I have too many friends there and too many facts to counter your America caused this crap argument. https://t.co/pYADAzsM2v
Give me a break. Have you been to Venezuela? Have you spoken to their people? I have. Look at the timeline and look at what they were in reponse to. The hardline policies and two leaders who nationalized industry with no way to run it and jailed opposition had nothing to do. Lol https://t.co/pYADAzsM2v
Chavez aligned himself with Cuba, screwed up Nicaragua, tried to destabilize other countries. Threatened Guyana of all places, made bad deals with China. Nationalized industry (socialized it), handpicked Maduro and then blamed American imperialists. What a tool. https://t.co/fAOhsAQb23
Go crawl back into your hole troll. I rarely block people, but you are on the verge. https://t.co/NvbWnvA3DN

I know. I was there a few years back during winter ball and saw some games. It was rough then and rougher now. Kudos to you for having the ganas to go right now. https://t.co/0xFZgUHwJW
Their coverage is average at best and usually after the fact or filled with agency stuff. Also some of them have Chavez a pass for a bit. I’m good. Thanks for the advice. I’d rather get the info first hand myself. https://t.co/ccytiqzbHJ

And it’s interesting in Venezuela because the Americans have had zero to do with this. Chavez made deals with the Chinese and the equipment sucked &amp; he nationalized a ton of stuff which destroyed it. Aaaah the wonders of socialism led by a madman..or two of em
Watch Venezuela very closely. They almost collapsed twice under Chavez and one of those times I was there. This time Maduro is blaming American Imperialists yet again and that means he’s in a major struggle to stay in power. It’s all of the military stays with him.
Huge congrats on the hard work to get this done to you and your team. https://t.co/BLv8DuzW6s
Huge news in the @MLS soccer world. The @SacRepublicFC and @KevinNagleMLS have teamed with Billionaire Ron Burkle. The part owner of the Penguins/big time investor is a huge get. Huge. Now onto NYC and MLS HQ. Sacramento is the most deserving city in country and we are fans!
Gonna be a good sports day I have a feeling
As @49ers fan and a Bay Area guy....just a reminder that you're 2 starting QB's in the Super Bowl are Bay Area guys and former Catholic School stars. We've got some decent talent up here. :)
You clearly don’t know me lol https://t.co/ZvRfk2sbvH
Yep https://t.co/a8MkRYJykw
It they are guaranteed 1. Not flawed at all https://t.co/fi2n60Ih1a
Needs to be a 5th qtr. 10 mins long. https://t.co/WVElulAap7
Yep. Great season. Still a horrific call. https://t.co/a4XvbJbRN0
Oh the Pats deserve huge credit. The rule still sucks. https://t.co/2fNeiKOR7M
Just want fairness and sensibility and I woulda said the same thing if the Chiefs had won the same way https://t.co/ZIw4WLvvuD
I would have said the same thing https://t.co/eeeFBkzTyN
If extra innings in baseball was like the NFL. A homerun in the top of the 10th would win the game. Stupid overtime rule...must be changed.
Yep https://t.co/0GGQDDdqzO
@49ers https://t.co/xXNqc3kQNQ
Anyone need a babysitter two weeks from today I am available.
Ugh GOAT no doubt. 3rd and long did the Chiefs in
Both teams should get the ball no matter what
This game should go overtime...the other one not so much
Lol. Yep. https://t.co/RZ91Ae2MWA
Take one shot and then kick it
What a game.
Not a Pats fan...but Beli and Brady are GOATS ..... ugh
I know...but....Mahomes could make a statement https://t.co/MjLcHob7qJ
Man both road teams win
KC needs to use timeouts now
That...is....not....a....catch
I think most of the country is rooting for him https://t.co/Ag4Rcwj3yn
I think Brady wins it here
Yep another big missed call and this one helps the Chiefs https://t.co/hKsx4EBmvK
Lol....the NFL already admitted one. So oooooo https://t.co/MUAR7u8pNs
Yep https://t.co/d9ZN2xaMev
Just calling it down the middle
They woulda never had the ball https://t.co/qLvc78zXyf
Yep...after the penalty to save the drive. https://t.co/oSdDT5mKU2
It shoulda been roughing the shoulder...defense number 95...15 yards to save the drive...first down.
Roughing call completely saved that drive. I have no horse in this game by the way.
And the catch rule still is a mess
Welp...continuing with the theme. Bad day for officiating in the NFL. The roughing call on Brady was unreal.
Seriously? https://t.co/esSxvXUPLv
They didn't miss the kick. https://t.co/ncOtUGe1In
Me too https://t.co/f54wD3uJD5
The NFL agreed. 2 missed calls. https://t.co/NTx7E9Gd4n
They did make the kick. The missed call was about time people. It gave the Rams nearly 2 mins. Otherwise they woulda had none. https://t.co/pioAu13vrt
Because there were messed calls on both sides throughout the game. The one at the end tho actually changed the game. https://t.co/eiORQqP1kZ
In this case you can. That call extended the game. The game was over if that call had been made https://t.co/sLZcKC0aMv
And the NFL just said they missed 2 calls on that play. This may be worse than the tuck rule game.
Nope....they woulda run the clock out. Game was over. https://t.co/Cq4SLYKOwu
But it should have never gone to overtime. https://t.co/OaNrP7WieJ
Hahahahahahahahahaha maybe best of the day https://t.co/MELw9XKCuu
Absolutely https://t.co/4U4VvJQO8Y
No comparison https://t.co/XIre7Nalqj
I am not a Saints or Rams fan...but in this case it absolutely did. They woulda ran the clock out. https://t.co/BHzOAaONMe
Absolutely. The horrible  on call just gave the Rams the win. Saints should be the ones moving on. https://t.co/nWA3nfHu7c
Saints fans should be upset. Unreal how that was not called and that would have been the end of the game.
Two pass interferences now completely missed and has this just changed the game.
We would no doubt https://t.co/AHXYv6wlhu
Make it happen https://t.co/vffgifikNF
There are a lot of things I can do..choosing the correct line has never been one of them.
I wasn’t even and didn’t even know about a speech. I’ve been on Disney Chanel all day other than the Chelsea match https://t.co/hjyBcRkUPd
Get over here and do that! https://t.co/egHBu4teiX
Just went through my twitter feed. Wow that was a mistake. Depressing and divided. Nothings changed...so there’s that
Taking a news break to watch @ChelseaFC kick Arsenal’s Arss. :) Let’s Go Blues!! @CFCInAmerica @LAChelseaBlues
Yes. Find the common ground first and then work on the bridge over the valley. https://t.co/TyNWrPDgQw
Will let you know https://t.co/Xm0vKpsHQO
Fantastic! https://t.co/rrUBnN7I1y
Thank you https://t.co/Iej629NS6R
We’re coming to Oklahoma !! @Centuryoakwine and my grandmas side of the family is from there. :) https://t.co/Iljy7elAz6
You got me thinking. https://t.co/56aOvhBSjb
@TwarowskiC Come find me and you will see. Just be nice..or try to every day. Not hard. It’s free.
And we are quick to point fingers and blame https://t.co/LCiLhlBQyp
You and my mom would buy it! :) https://t.co/iOl1tm1RWU
So in conclusion. A discussion is good and for those who discussed thank you. For those who spewed crap you are part of the problem. Remember Most people are good. Not perfect. Good and we need to build them up.
Go Philly! https://t.co/MSGq9KiN4y
Real men stick up for their wives, family, kids, friends and themselves. Real men call out those who do wrong instead of making blanket accusations. I’ll continue to respect people for who they are and call out the bad. A called decency. Try it. Most of us do.
Yep https://t.co/AnDsWY9tpM
If I am the problem and people like me...then we are screwed. You ever done anything to make change or help a woman/man in need? I have. https://t.co/2poVwzwXw1
I said that earlier in this thread https://t.co/emZZn1tizi
I never have. Have you? https://t.co/XZJgbEozcz
One...I’m not right but clearly you are a clairvoyant so you know. Two...typical...those people are bad and point a finger while throwing everyone in the same pot. Solves nothing and only alienates. Congrats. https://t.co/GeBESrOoZa
@JudithPeterse19 Yes I am feeling guilty. Oooooooh you got me. Lol #yourpartoftheproblem
@ThatSingularity Basically stop the generalizations and the “all _____ insert group” are this or that. Men and women are different. That’s ok. Men need to behave and women need to behave. The massive, massive majority of us know what that entails.
@Dsnicol2 And raising them right.
Exactly! https://t.co/zFmndoOXwD
Reeeeeelax. I’m talking about with each other and yes government is too big and has overstepped its bounds and we need to streamline and make it work better. I grew up in a small business. https://t.co/4oZDGSKgwB
Or too easily upset https://t.co/tQBng0HH8b
Good point https://t.co/tQBng0HH8b
Exactly...we are free to vote for whomever we want to. It’s called America and if we lose that we are in serious trouble https://t.co/eLFO9a4KVZ
@VTMinEngSR Of course we ALL have space to get better
Yep https://t.co/2y20HyINLo
Best one of the day https://t.co/uCC0A4Gdrk
Be kind and discuss. Start the civility here.
Yep https://t.co/n6fc64tEX6
He is part of the problem....clearly. He didn’t get the be kind memo https://t.co/ibTJw3ZCBC
The massive majority of us know how to behave. https://t.co/knbcbesnlL
Proving my point. Never supported him or voted for him. Didn’t support Hillary either. I’m an issue guy and not a party guy. You clearly listen to rumor. https://t.co/6G8btzE8HV
So the way to solve this is to be good. Do good. Help people. Discuss, not yell and call names. Lead by example. Do the little things right. Wow I sound like my parents.
Teenagers in general https://t.co/3zhJMAQPPw
As a guy I also know this. We’ve been told bad boys are what girls want and nice guys finish last. Most the bad boys I know or have known were weak and all image and when push came to shove...had no guts between the white lines.
Yep https://t.co/PaElqH05FH
We gotta start somewhere https://t.co/SlBQ56qces
@BobbyJordan3 @irishknitter17 Yep. It is. Sorry.
@ChuckBasset No it’s called discussing. You sure seem opposed to a difference of opinion?
Actions have made the change. Of course words are a part of that, but every day actions change things. Oh and people know how to behave, they just choose to, or not. I already have parents. https://t.co/Em6NNMKU1i
I leave all you experts with this. We all need to lead change. We all need to be nicer and care more. We all need to discuss and not yell. Be the example. Be kind. Don’t preach and order...DO! It starts with all of us.
@VTMinEngSR That’s nothing of the same
@7bestoftimes New and desperately needed? Most men are not clueless and those who bully, mistreat women and do bad... Know exactly what they are doing. And they are in the minority by far.
LOL. You just did the same thing and completely proved my point. The glass is half full. https://t.co/vYjpUTuXKG
AND most people in this country are good people. Most boys and most girls. Most men and most women. You need to stop lecturing people you don’t connect with. Change comes with action, not words.
I mean it’s not that serious and it’s ok to have an opinion and disagree and have a completely different experience. Your experience isn’t scientific and neither is mine. Too many people go looney over opinions. Discussion is what’s missing.
Why many of you don’t understand and man have I had some unscientific responses...is that you’d be frustrated if you were thrown in the same pot as something or someone who is completely opposite of your life. Generalizations do nothing. https://t.co/Pn3ShOQLmy
@Bubba_T_Rex Nope
@KeysAndVices It’s simple. Most people are good. In fact a large majority of people are good. Not perfect, good. Society/Hollywood/politicians like to tell you otherwise. The good need to stand up and run things. Period.
Yep. We need to use our good to destroy evil. We outnumber it massively yet we give it a voice and a place. We must destroy. Good will always win. https://t.co/qdn3eLqYiG
Love me some South Carolina. Was there for the eclipse https://t.co/HdmJqy59JH
@SteveGotch I actually used metoo also as a generalization. Call out those doing bad. Period. Treat people nice. Period. It’s just common decency.
Lol https://t.co/m7Wum7GlD0
#alainasvoice https://t.co/eK8EmOzC22
Try that in LA!! https://t.co/daWev5kcMg
Love me some #Endymion and have ridden about 5 times https://t.co/5aqcKum0xh
I agree...I said we because I was generalizing the overall situation. Good job! https://t.co/lDZgYyGRQt
👍 https://t.co/vXDCMf52A7
Yep https://t.co/zlT9IcWVj5
Thank you https://t.co/Sr6M70gkBS
Will do https://t.co/80qojSJEiK
I have seen it for sure. I was generalizing about how we treat each other. https://t.co/jlD3E2Wzbe
Again. For much of the country we’ve forgotten how to be kind. We hide behind an o line profile. We don’t say hello in the store or hold doors. Little things become big things. Let’s do the little things right and the big will come.
Most abusers hide their abuse from everyone. They have major issues clearly. The only way we can rid of them is for darkness to be brought into light.
I would say the same thing. The massive majority of women I know are great people https://t.co/1RzIauKWrs
@floraliiisa Because most men do and the numbers of us who do have only been growing. Nice guys are badass and do finish first...contrary to what we’ve been sold over the years
@LedbetterLux @NikkiMedoro Copy
Yep. Just be kind https://t.co/DXziCPLmgT
Yep https://t.co/zDIzOVovC7
Yep https://t.co/6mMll7tabx
Sadly https://t.co/FsoM50OqAB
That ain’t my message at all. My message is actually what you said. https://t.co/97pXQnYaxp
Lol https://t.co/xmq6CK9KoA
I agree and I am happy the douchbags and guys who were slime balls are getting called out. Remember...good guys finish first and that’s not what we’ve been sold https://t.co/G041RY1Qk4
@NikkiMedoro Lol. So the only way to respond to say me. Ok. Lol.
@ThatSingularity That I would stick up for good men who support women and raise daughters and sons to be good people? It’s weird you wouldn’t support that
Listen people...we all know how to treat each other..we do...it comes down to the question do we want to?
Yep https://t.co/iEFeM5RdG0
Exactly https://t.co/feMoGmOcyB
But most are...I know TV and movies show another side, but generalizing and throwing everyone into one pot is not the answer at all https://t.co/1AWeTNetgE
Very true. But still...we have to be careful with the generalizations https://t.co/Ke0no2jjBk
Most men are https://t.co/recDEaG6gc
The AD did what it was supposed to do tho...so brilliant move. Got everyone talking.
Dear Gillette: most men have never bullied anyone. Never mistreated a woman. In fact, most men I know and have met from all walks of life are raising daughters/have wives and of course moms. We support #metoo because it calls out the losers &amp; shows nice guys finish 1st. Got it?
And they shoulda added a closer in 2016. That’s the year they could have grabbed another possibly...they’ve never recovered from the second half bull pen debacle https://t.co/IlJoyd9cDP
Started waaaaaaay before that. That’s just one piece of the divide https://t.co/5u25ADS17G
Thank you https://t.co/PbSsszagq4

Thanks and it’s dang good @Centuryoakwine too https://t.co/qcQ8Dhfs6w
They are strong and faithful, but we are all still heartbroken https://t.co/wXaOyo1QEP
Nope...both parties are filled with hypocrisy and complete irrationalism https://t.co/aPG1AfYiDj

Me too. :) https://t.co/mC5lrbEhW0
31 days 23 hours until Pitchers and Catchers report....but who's counting?
And while I am at it...there is absolutely no reason for reporters and the networks to plaster a shooters name and face on every report and story. Unless there is a manhunt, or a continued threat, the name and face needs no mention. I can speak to this firsthand
LOL....enjoy! and thanks for your service! https://t.co/hLrZfWXtDB

Making wine...but....keeping my ear to the ground. https://t.co/Do5UdGfVb9
Basically...we all just need to learn how to talk to one another. I know I know...dream world you'll say. So what's the alternative? If enough of us do that...and we are the majority, then we could change the tone. Period.
You guys all know I didn't vote for either. You also know I broke the Unmasking Story and the FBI story...both of which started well BEFORE Trump. Neither story has found a conclusion. There are a few independent reporters doing a damn good job.
@gm5626 Yep...or the world
I see a lot of plastic in the first world too. I said worldwide because it's worldwide. https://t.co/SdpRVmLWqH
You are the one!! https://t.co/7wcJRX6o3U
Today politics sucks in both parties. Not trying to be Mr. Centrist...I am just a realist and I call out the blatant hypocrisy and the fact that our news agencies are largely failing us. We get virtually no international news or middle ground. https://t.co/9FZAFoHrgt
@01sassafrass I clearly can't individually name everyone..but many conservatives automatically get defensive when talking about the environment...not all...but many. I understand the left has used environmental issues against business at times, but there are enviro issues we can ALL agree on

This could be the worst analogy of the day. Reagan was excellent at working across the aisle and yet being beyond firm at the same time. https://t.co/4rE5QPbXZs
@LouChouteau Relax
Clearly hasn't worked...and then where does it go? It's still gonna go somewhere. https://t.co/VmRx3LnFls
Some do...most don't. We can have exceptions. Straws are not the issue. Plastic water bottles and other single use that have no benefit. https://t.co/VlZyBL309i

I did too! https://t.co/qLYlJ6ETAK
Lol....that’s true too! https://t.co/DE3JBTLp88
@g_hart09 I know....right?!
Nope “insane” means going to the extreme and making political assumptions....or frothing at the mouth before you even know why you are frothing = social media today https://t.co/N9TwHhUDUK

Let me see if I can find it https://t.co/Wc2di2JOY4
You see right away the conservatives on my feed went insane. You’ve gone liberal!! People, People, People...we can actually fix things without making them political...if enough of us care to do so. That’s not Liberal or Conservative...that’s smart.
Ummmmm yeah. Read my thread and you’ll get what I mean. https://t.co/GQS0Yw6j8f
There is more than one issue. I think we can handle more than one issue. Focusing on one issue and where we disagree is exactly why we are stuck with the way we are. https://t.co/ATNHFOZbHu
People People People....reeeeeeelax and think and stop being reactionary. The issue is not single use medical plastics...have you been overseas? Heck have you seen some of our urban rivers? Water bottles and other crap that can be replaced with compostable/biodegradable !! https://t.co/g4a3iG3X63
Not the plastic use I am referring to https://t.co/Fb3DXuqHTJ
@aspfrt @SlightlyBreezee Praying for his family. Heartbreaking.
They have compostable products, I ate a spoon on air about 8 years ago. https://t.co/vfgWf7jIgh

So do I @Centuryoakwine https://t.co/yJky7CsjeF
I wasn’t even thinking about straws.....that’s small potatoes...oh and potatoes can and are used for compostable plastic #coveredthatstory https://t.co/pqnr3YSaBO

Absolutely nothing 😂 https://t.co/Q0eyfDQzop
I just covered the ocean plastic issue and I’ve read a few things recently and I also covered compostable plastic and I know there can and couple be alternatives in many...NOT ALL...cases https://t.co/4yBKb8LiCN
Good point https://t.co/K6NS1m2hDC
OMG...some of you guys need to have a glass of wine or mediate/pray/whatever....reeeeeeeeelax. There are a ton of issues and this is just one. https://t.co/Dk635fLsHc
In many cases we can do this...compostable and biodegradable plastics are available and viable. https://t.co/PP1tVEGD0v
I’m talking about throw away single use for the consumer not anything to do with medical or food security. Stop overthinking. Just sick of seeing all the plastic bottles and waste https://t.co/QGnMyaiyXM
We need to ban single use plastics worldwide.

Congrats @Hertz for one of the worst car rental service experiences in memory...and I’ve done a ton of traveling. Fort Lauderdale and online was rough. Thanks to @Avis for coming thru in a pinch.
@keithlaw take on Barry Bonds and especially Bud Selig is absolutely spot on. I might add that PED’s were all the talk in the minors in the mid to late 90’s and anyone claiming they didn’t know should be kept out for either lying, or complete ignorance

@MoCitySoulja And I’ve got people tweeting me that clearly I was a Lib hiding on Fox at the same time others are tweeting me that I am conservative and need to go back to Fox. Lol. Proves I’m doing something right when both sides say I am on the other.
@SlightlyBreezee They let the other one off. It shoulda been investigated also. That’s part of the problem that was McCabe. The other problem is if you say McCabe automatically you support Trump. Nope. I just want truth.
@Jauthor12 Thank you and to your family also
Clearly you have an opinion and issues with Flynn. I am not defending him. I am saying there are some serious questions about some at high levels in non elected positions before Trump ever sniffed running. If you deny that...you are part of the problem. https://t.co/XgelbC2Dfe
@ItsMeDoublEE @SusanMay65 Yeah no
@dawn_dknapp2 @LBC1983 I am not defending Trump .Org. Never have.
@AptronCintril There’s solutions. Both parties even have answers. They are too busy trying to beat each other. They are more concerned with inside the beltway..or maybe it’s more disconnected with outside the beltway than ever before.
Absolutely. https://t.co/xF7sBsvZVr
@ItsMeDoublEE @SusanMay65 Ok so let me get this straight. In order to be non partisan I can only attack Trump and avoid the complete hypocrisy enveloping DC. Got it. Aaaaaand that’s why the media has lost its cred.
@LULZZZZZY Thanks for following.
@Brycejanderson @SusanMay65 Oh his has issues for sure...no doubt...but there were flies in the wine on the other...good wine...but flies.
@dawn_dknapp2 @LBC1983 Yeah nope
@SusanMay65 The Clinton Foundation also had serious questions and actions...they may be fine now, but to argue anything other than that is completely partisan
@butchpaula True...gotten worse tho since Clinton/Gingrich upped the game
Our diagnosis is completely different. https://t.co/ltSfeAOOf5
I’d never win. 1. I’d tell the truth. 2. I’ve actually either been to, or covered almost all major issues foreign or domestic...so talking points won’t fly. 3. Both parties are a mess...soooo 4. They’d attack my family with lies. Heck they already do. https://t.co/P2sQPq3XyX
Example A....Trump Foundation clearly has issues. Clinton Foundation clearly has issues. To argue either doesn’t...means you are drinking kool aid from one side of the aisle or other.
@MrShaneReaction Lol....kinda like parent trap...either version...where one kid played both parts.
What’s crazy and downright insane is the double standard I continue to see from my friends on both sides of the aisle. Until people begin to see that both parties have major issues and leaders in both parties...then ain’t nothin gonna change
4 times...now that’s funny https://t.co/MxlpjFMU4c
@SomeRandomGuy5 Actually since nobody would address the elephant in the room kudos to the WSJ for doing it. Pretty much no line between news and opinion these days. So no correction necessary. My original tweet is factually correct and clearly doesn’t follo your political ideology
Lol https://t.co/sXIxmNla5R
@SomeRandomGuy5 Yep I do. I also don’t have blinders on.
I miss when news covered news also. https://t.co/i7VSbLqVID

I got messages and it spoiled it. https://t.co/wzJyqFKR4z
I put the kids down and come back to the game and the Chargers score 79 points in 2 mins to beat the Chiefs. Why I why couldn’t that have happened before bedtime?!
Exactly https://t.co/2KLlCazoOn
Again kudos to WSJ for reporting
The media hasn’t reported it and they don’t feel protected and they have families to feed. https://t.co/csp8hTzoOd
And a reminder....the massive majority of agents in the @FBI are damn good at what they do. Even at high levels. I saw that as a correspondent and now on the family victims side. Do not let any bad apples taint the essential work done my agents every hour of every day.
We should all want truth. We should all want accountability. We should all demand cordiality from our elected officials. We are not getting that on both sides of the aisle. #enough
The Flynn Entrapment - WSJ...I never supported either candidate. Just truth. This story has been known to some of us and kudos to the WSJ for reporting it. He got intro the crosshairs of the FBI for sticking up for an agent I believe back in 2012.  https://t.co/fSBdbsrbCs

In case anyone is listening, watching, following...as it’s been explained to me....Lots of big law firms on the FARA list in 2018. Curious who they represent?
BINGO #2 "Basically few were convicted on FARA up until Mueller SC from what I understand. Now those who’ve been underreporting their relationships with foreign nations are suddenly worried they may be in trouble if caught." My question...will Mueller cast that wide of a net?
Sent 2 me: BINGO: "I think Adam’s saying that a lot of ppl on both sides are scrambling to cover their butts bc DC ppl have been “lax” (intentionally w/ FARA) Now after years of non compliance they’re afraid they'll get caught like Flynn Interesting to see who’s working for whom.
Smart move. Doc is a great guy and a better leader of men. https://t.co/qUmK3Oyck4
There is no story and that’s the point https://t.co/V2xJ0OC4BS
I'm not defending Trump. I'm not attacking him either. I just am curious to know who else filled out paperwork incorrectly, or even filled it out at all. Also wondering why nobody in the media is pursuing this info. Kinda important don't you think? https://t.co/lAhhAmDIw3
Should be a fun match for sure https://t.co/VHZ1uTgmqk
But then again...to do that would require someone without a political bent and a dedication to journalism. Is that even available in this day and age?
Someone may want to look into the massive increase in foreign agent filings with the DOJ...and the increased scrutiny since General Flynn's case. I am told some interesting names on both sides of the aisle. I am curious if scrutiny is the same..as it should be.

There is no need. NONE...for the news media and the websites to put shooters names and photos in stories and headlines. It feeds them. Unless there is a manhunt, or specific investigative reason..there is no need. I can speak to this first hand. We..the media..feed this also https://t.co/dfpxDUs3yq

@Diana_Westlund @Bucks @LAClippers we thank you for your support. #alainahousley
@SlightlyBreezee @arikjih and I and our families agree #enough
While the pain about Alaina is intense and I wish I could somehow give my life for hers, I hear about the devastating fire in Paradise and Magalia. An area where I first started in TV. Such amazing people. Such a beautiful part of the world. Also the horrible fire in Malibu
My heart hurts for all the innocent victims of violence. The families in Thousand Oaks. My law enforcement friends have told me more about officer Helus. He is truly a hero. We are so thankful for his actions that night.
@debs1127 @TheEllenShow Thank you
@mommallama3 @TheEllenShow It will change when we realize that we have lost our soul and our heart. We need to start there and we need to reach out a hand rather than point a finger.
@Daughterofdayco She will and she is. Thank you.

Thank you John https://t.co/V9pMAzWcPS
They will step up...They will step up. I can guarantee for Alaina and all those lights we lose to violence...they WILL step up. The change in this country starts now. https://t.co/nI8S3Ndbvr
I am so heartbroken. so mad. Mad at what we’ve become. Even my feed where thousands &amp; thousands &amp;even @TheEllenShow have offered sympathies, people still show they have no heart. People..we’ve lost our soul in this country. We’ve lost our hearts..and we lost a beautiful light https://t.co/nI8S3Ndbvr
Thinking about all my friends in Paradise and the fire that has destroyed that lovely city...and now my friends in Malibu and the Bentura county cities threatened by this fire.

@edmundpburke @Snikk Lacking? I’d say mostly missing these days
I need to get one. Have friends that swear by them and when I’ve used it with them, it was impressive https://t.co/ToS9BvXv2T
@JamesW62 Get your facts straight. I work for myself, not a network.
And maybe that’s the answer. But no national calls until all the national polls are closed. Period. https://t.co/taX6n1fGEo
@mc_va Again your premise is wrong. With that premise then why hold off calling any race? What’s good for the entire country is good for the entire country. Period.
@Mbag999Maximus1 Yep this thing called simple math could also allow the media to call races within states before polls close, but that isn’t allowed. Shouldn’t be allowed nationwide either.
Not my company. https://t.co/pgUmfXUwlj
And for those of you agreeing with an early call because “California is too liberal and who cares”...a geography lesson. We also have states called Arizona, Nevada, Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon...and others still voting when a call for both House and Senate were made
@YouMeandDougie @BillKristol Yeah in history it was equal to Reagan’s...so proving my point. So thanks for reminding me to include the historical numbers. The divide continues and no party has a mandate.
Hey...it’s ok for wishful thinking that actually people could work together. Come on now. Of course give it like 5 hours.
@johnondrasik Lol
Thanks https://t.co/UIf7rRUvBV
The Repubs seem to have gone more Trump. The Dems are going to have to contend between the clear divide between the progressives and non progressives. Pelosi’s speech tonight, telling. No Trump attacks and focused on issues. Maybe some people can finally work together?
So here is the fair take on the night: Repubs did well in the Senate, but they should have. Dems did well in the House, but they should have. No blue wave. No Trump mandate. Big names and blank checks didn’t help. The divide is still very clear.
I should have said leadership elitism...it only matters where they live. Anything in the west is too late. https://t.co/bH6fBoDSVG

There are others out there...not many tho https://t.co/JRY2LLjzZ1
And I’m not suggesting as some of you are..that there was anything fishy. I just think it’s typical east coast elitism and media desperation to be first. Neither is an excuse. Wait til all polls close. Period. Both House and Senate were called too early.
One. We wait to call until all polls close. Period. Otherwise call the races in the easy while they are still open. https://t.co/nmHRI7Laku
@DeeSnuttsss Get your facts straight. Not my employer
Nope. We wait til polls close in the east and it should be the same across the continent. Period. https://t.co/ebZtvrkGTA
I believe multiple national organizations called the House and Senate before polls closed. One for Repubs and one for Dems...both parties should disallow this. It is unfair to the millions of voters in all parties in the west.
@soupman695 Looks good to me!
As someone who grew up on the west coast, I am still pissed when networks call the country. They’ve called both the House and Senate before the west was done voting. That should not be. Both parties I think can agree on this.
No back up needed. Thanks for the offer tho. https://t.co/1oseU7QNGO

So people who lived miles away from anything can't even get quotes, which is driving up costs. Makes no sense.
So I know everyone is consumed with the election...but there is other news and the industry needs to cover it. For example...a number of insurance companies have a moratorium on writing any policies for people in Nor Cal because of the fires. Even if you live in the city.
Thanks! https://t.co/E3RnOuUznD
There are so many reasons Americans should care about foreign policy. So many. From the money we spend, to the mistakes we continue to make on the international stage. Now..having said that..for some reason Bergdahl was celebrated in the rose garden. Look whose celebrating now?

@JohnHogHannah1 Im politically all over the board..so I kinda do the same with news sources. I follow Sky News and BBC and the American outlets and NPR and VOA and then Using my own experiences with many of these issues/people firsthand I come to a conclusion.

I’m not picking a side. I’m staying straight. Calling it like it is as always.
For the record folks. The rhetoric on both sides sucks. We’ve lost our way. So Repubs don’t point fingers and Dems also. Never been a more ripe time for a viable 3rd party. Now back to wine.

Now back to more important stuff. Pitchers and catchers report on different days in February depending on the team and some guys come in earlier as well to get a jump on getting into shape.
@leele505 @TheRealDay @shaderoomnews @breakfastclubam @DLHughleyRadio I can’t control what other people say or do...and I sure as hell have zero time to search everyone’s timelines who retweet me. So I always condemn crap when I see it. If you think otherwise then you wrong and I suggest you unfollow.
@leele505 @TheRealDay @shaderoomnews @breakfastclubam @DLHughleyRadio @TheRealDaytime Never called you a troll. I said trolls had made crap up and taken things out of context. You questioned me remember? I’m having a fantastic evening and hopefully you are as well.

@sk8face23 @oldanglican A hoax by Dems? Wow. Never said that anywhere and I believe if you read the timeline you will are they clearly said a right wing nut had not been ruled out at all
Agreed https://t.co/xmqyYhbX5z
@chainlinkspiral @VettingBernie But that’s exactly what they said. If others politicized it, that’s the problem.
This is what they said and tweeted yesterday...one more to follo..if people made it political that’s on them. Just put out exactly what was going on as it progressed and as I was told https://t.co/1RLWxQvMEr
@VettingBernie @chainlinkspiral They clarified the semantics yesterday and I put that out immediately. Not doubling down on anything and I sure as heck never took a political side
@VettingBernie @MariaArriola4 I clearly stated this could be a nut in the right. Clearly. So did those involved. They never dismissed that possibility. Reported it straight from the outset.
@MariaArriola4 Look at the whole feed and their clarifications and specifics as the day went on. Why they also changed the wording. Propagating nothing.
@chainlinkspiral We disagree
@chainlinkspiral Then you can’t comprehend. They clearly clarified and it matches exactly. All were missing components.
@chainlinkspiral Did you not read the whole timeline and the clarification they made to me later in the day yesterday. Maybe read the whole thing before attacking
@MzOyle @terib3294 Not really.
Good work by the men and women in law enforcement.
Yep https://t.co/AjjGK8WCdI

my sense is that they do. https://t.co/MO81Y1Ht01
yep https://t.co/fOzhXK52lA
Ultimately politics has riled up both sides...yet again. Agents just want to make sure nobody lets their guard down. it only takes 1
The belief this afternoon was that they didn't go off by design. Of course investigations change...still being told every single one was missing components to make it viable. https://t.co/eRzM9V1Fpa
Still being told every single bomb was missing components..not all the same missing parts
Purposely non-functional was one of their theories. https://t.co/NfhO45MqKj

@SharylAttkisson That’s one thing the agents are saying...were they purposely dressed down to keep the charges/punishment down? Just a thought.
Absolutely https://t.co/Sl0NHjmGpo

I got no agenda that’s for sure https://t.co/zLLb6OriXy
Not sure. I know they ain’t talking to who I am talking to https://t.co/kzKdcKbgv4
Thank you https://t.co/uORXi2AKhC
@jeffraykovich Thank you
AND.....Agents also don’t want everyone to think they are all hoaxes, because one could be real...people might let their guards down. And that might be the long game in all this. So again semantics...hoax may never be used officially, but all were designed not to detonate.
Some of the media is reporting they could have because of the powder found inside. It was an unstable powder...and again the strong belief is that all were missing a couple of components on purpose. None could have gone off this far
So here is the clarification on semantics on all this: the FBI Lab will@make the final call on all of these. So far the belief is that they all didn’t go off by design. They were all missing a couple of components.
My sources were telling me this yesterday https://t.co/h1jMUvz8qf

Thank you. I follow no party, or candidate...just truth. We need more truth in this world. :) https://t.co/5hH6S81IoQ
As I also reported last night....Agents expected more to be found today....yep...that's true too. I wonder how close they are getting to finding whoever is responsible. That...I have no insight. yet. Also...no clues whether this is a right/left person or group, or from outside
Yep...how did you guess. lol https://t.co/u0xc3zRzJz
I was just listing all possibilities. I am confident they have eliminated some already. https://t.co/IdHCPRuPxj
I am not saying someone on the left did this, or someone on the right..or a foreign entity...I am just reporting the facts and despite what others reported yesterday, it seems my sources were all correct.
Never forget the Cudas https://t.co/INed1P0udB
Unless it was mean to stir up both sides this close to an election. I have no idea,  it that would be my guess. https://t.co/ZRVF41ZNVK
@7bestoftimes Copy that
Isn’t not including a detonation device stopping short? https://t.co/qahjckJYUv
Why thank you https://t.co/xcgCnqAheG
@7bestoftimes Not framing it any way. Just listed the possibilities as listed to me by agents.
Minor leagues with the Tigers and Brewers and drafted by the Expos. Love taking baseball and miss it every day...especially in these times https://t.co/eGMt5Yl4bH
Also...one technician thinks the person or persons responsible knew exactly what they were doing and stopped short for a reason and that they actually could have made them functional if they wanted to. Again...dry run? Hoax by the right or the left...or foreign entity?
Also with all the misreporting...only one package found in LA..addressed to Maxine Waters. Agents say it’s likely more packages could be found tomorrow.
And to stir it up even more...earlier this afternoon one investigator said a foreign entity hadn’t been ruled out. I gotta believe by this hour...they got a good idea
I can’t even go through all the convos I have been tagged in. It would literally take me years. https://t.co/FjhBwZ2B0l

I have been to that facility before. It is massive and has a ton of hardworking employees.
The response is to suspicious packages addressed to Congressmen and women found in a mail facility in South Central Los Angeles
@BBCANSTAN32 @BigMama279 @wire2wre A journalist who said San Bernardino was terrorism when others were reporting not...amongst many other breaks along the way
FBI and multiple other agencies responding to a u.s. postal facility in south central where suspicious packages addressed to u.s. Congress members were found. Investigating to determine whether linked to suspicious packages discovered in other parts of the country today.
From fed source: “complete hoaxes” multiple wires when they only needed one. Reports of cell phones being involved was false. So no intention of harm. Now the questions. Dry run, or a false flag from the right or left trying to mess over the other side?
And in more important news https://t.co/Hdipq0trp7
When threats like this happen..a ton of consequences...agencies getting a ton more calls on suspicious packages which takes away from other calls..also hearing the FBI might have an 800 number for tips by this afternoon

Absolutely. We have the best on this for sure. https://t.co/JQyJkDr9x7
Meant to do harm or not...someone will be caught and prosecuted for this.
Listing facts and what I was told...and that agents have ruled nothing out at this point. Yep...clear bias with that line. Then I get some jackass who says thanks captain obvious. lol....wow...look at what we've become. We should be so proud.
You know what's wrong with many of you right now? You want journalism and facts, but then you attack because your head is so far in the sand. The right side is saying I'm and dismissing this...the left says I am already calling this a false flag. You both are ridiculous
To clarify to anyone trying to politicize: I am insinuating nothing. Just reporting actual facts. Imagine that. Actual possibilities and what investigators are doing. Nowhere did I say false flag. It is one possibility tho, as is dry run. Get it?
The fact that the devices were crude of course is a clue, but again...there are other variables that you may not think of. All this has to be taken into consideration by law enforcement. Dry Run? Hoax? True intention? Distraction for something else? Just a few examples I'm told
Get this...while many on air are already politicizing this...the fact remains...the men and women investigating and hunting the responsibility could care less how its spun...its about finding and ensuring it doesn't happen again from this group or person
Dave Roberts is a friend and you can't count out the Dodgers...but man that Sox lineup is non stop. https://t.co/UXtUBqnqGg
Also being investigated...and this is kinda obvious...whether all packages came from expedited carriers. It would make sense why they all arrived around the same time and stamps may have not been cancelled.
Those looking into these bombs at the ground level rule nothing out and don't sit around and watch the opinions on the national news, they are waste deep into this and they are some of the best in the business.
I am told..by agents who haven't before and are not now taking a political side...that this political climate and everyone already politicizing it only makes things worse. No matter what you believe, the fact that this was done is concerning.
Federal agents say they are working on the theory that it's one group, or one person. Also...the fact that none of them detonated is more significant than people may realize. I am told that's a "huge clue".
@richardshell Not sure what the heck you are talking about.
@SacRepublicFC let’s do this !! Put one in the net.

I can’t speak to the Political stuff on this...my info and reporting is about the power struggle and frustrations between agents and the brass.
A ton of agents were hoping David Bowdich would move up and eventually take over. Heard his name over and over as “the rank and file think he could be the guy to get us back on track”. Problem is...uncertainty over FBI leadership and direction. Is he independent of it?
The men and women of the FBI in the field are doing essential work RT @BruceHagen: Not so sure
People know way more than I’ve heard. My info comes from the Bureau. They’re talking now. RT @sandiegodavo: @adamhousley Be safe, Adam.. People have died for less recently.  Be careful.
Exactly RT @teamrope: @adamhousley Others counted days to retirement
The massive amount of agents are doing essential work every day. RT @tracygirl58: @adamhousley I hope the rank and file of the FBI realizes that most of mainstream America still respects their work and does not think they are corrupt.
In no way am I saying Wray is or was a bad guy. Don’t know that. Do know the interaction when he found out about McCabe and the agents feel for him. Many like him...but they have to know they’ll be protected.
An agent who stood up to this clique 2012/13 timeframe “I have been told by numerous people to watch my back. It was an uneasy feeling in DC. Did what I had to do but had to look over my shoulder the entire time. I took taxis when I normally would walk. I felt very exposed.”
Many agents haven’t spoken about their concerns because Republican leaders have offered no protection, Dems think it’ll help the Pres and Wray they aren’t sure about
Im told Wray supported McCabe strongly and was even defiant at the meeting on the Hill. Then when he saw and heard the info he had no choice and wasn’t happy with those who told him and also McCabe.
It was all about the club. Were you in it...or not.
I know a bunch of agents and former agents. This was internal and about power.
That’s the question. I’m told Comey liked being the face and let McCabe run the show.  It sure how much Comey knew, but agents had issues in 2012 and 2013 RT @jray_redfever: @adamhousley Wray didn't know.... but did Comey ?
No way. Bret Baier is one of the best in the business. Solid and fair. RT @wits_mcgee: @adamhousley @BretBaier ?
I’m told Wray confronted Congressman while defending McCabe...it got heated. When the info was finally presented to him he left abruptly and then confronted McCabe at the Bureau...that didn’t go well.
I can report this all now. There were about 18 people that we know of so far. A clique. They were the ones meeting and I’m told Wray didn’t know about the meetings. One was the right before McCabe testified. Republican or Democrat didn’t matter it was all about power
Many agents...damn good men and women serving in the Bureau and some who were forced to leave or retired in time...are watching how this plays out. Grab the bag of popcorn. Oh and B....wherever you are...I was right...you shoulda listened.
When I broke the FBI story I said it wasn’t political it was about power and while there has always been a power issue at the Bureau, it had gotten significantly worse. Agents were being punished for standing up. I also said months ago if McCabe was fired he’d take others.
@Jerrywa59Jerry Everyone...meet Jerry. This crap of man calls himself a poet. Look at what nice words he had for me and my wife. Sad life he lives.
@joshuafsmith081 @PcolaBucsfan @SharylAttkisson @OANN Thanks man
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed Thank you for the fair questions and the opportunity to fairly clarify
@Phylliz53 Phyllis...well said. I will say this...not knowing you. If you meet anyone who truly has ever spent a second with us you’ll be told we are what you see...no acting or baloney. We love meeting people, seeing places and loving life.
Haven’t mentioned the Carolinas. Spent a summer playing in the South Atlantic League and have many friends in the Cape Fear area and across the region. Anything we can do from out here in the West let me know!
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed OMG...I just did. Never supported him and as a reporter we have to show the story as fairly as possible. Everyone else can opine.

@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed My wife, family and friends are my everything. Everything. Nothing can change that. Attack me all you want. Lie and misrepresent and takes tweets out of context all you want. I know the truth. My family and friends and the God I believe in knows the truth.
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed People are gonna read these and the haters are still gonna hate and call me names and attack my wife. What they need to know...we have a bond...one protected by the God we love..that no man...no woman...will break. They can try...but it won’t happen.
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed It’s sad when they attack what people are actually fighting for. Most of us just want to get along and respect each other and enjoy each other. Anyone who knows me...anyone...knows I could case less what color you are, where you come from..who you love. We need more peace
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed Friends in Africa, Palestine, Israel, Pakistan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Ireland, N Ireland, England, Wales, Scotland, Portugal, Croatia, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Canada....do you get the idea? It’s sad when people just want to break that down
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed It’s just easy to join the bullies and call names and accuse and label and misrepresent. Anyone who has ever met or knows me...knows I have and always will love all. I’ve been blessed to see all parts of the world and have friends from all places
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed I reported and always have..what I saw. In Ferguson my reporting was applauded by other media outlets and I stood with business owners, most of them black, as they picked up the pieces. We raised thousands to help the rebuild during my reports. All taken out of context now
@MariaArriola4 @tariqnasheed Maria I did explain..yet those words are then twisted as well and only feed those who never liked me or my marriage anyways. Look at the whole thread at the time and realize as a reporter, we have to report as it happens. Never, ever defended him and never attacked Trayvon
Thanks Robyn RT @IamMzbird: @adamhousley That’s really deep Adam and well said.
Thanks! RT @KevinDLemieux: Welcome home @adamhousley! Keep doing what you’re doing! See you out on the soccer/baseball/track over the coming years - or at Molinari’s.
@amirimizan @tariqnasheed As a journalist you have to cover the story from the center until it changes. That’s what a reporter does. An opinion person takes a side. Big difference. Many times I have gone to a story and had an opinion, but you have to find the middle ground. All reporters do that.
My tweets about that were 5 years ago, before we knew all details, never defended him. Look at the whole thread. It was about being a journalist and covering both sides. RT @amirimizan: @adamhousley @tariqnasheed Dude if ur not enraged by Zimmerman, you are a bigot. Period.
@PNMaster_ @SJMLCMX2 @MarionSyversen @tariqnasheed We love South Africa...I wasn’t talking about any genocide..I had friends white and black saying that things had gotten ugly. I hope not. It’s such an amazing country and our time there was truly amazing and I can’t wait to bring the kids.

So back to wine and soccer. Harvest is almost here and I have new videos posted on Instagram @Centuryoakwine and @adamhousley so go check em out and I can answer any questions there! https://t.co/yW0wFhfwod
It’s just easy to attack...misrepresent..call names...do what you can from afar to try and tear down love. I know this...and I’ll leave it here. My wife is an amazing woman. We have thousands of friends from all walks of life who know us and know our hearts. Haters be damned.
If you look this happens about once ever my year or so...people attack...call me racist. Misrepresent me and my wife. Every once in a while we have to fight back. It’s sad really, nobody reaches out to find the truth, or take the time to find out who we are as people
It absolutely is and people are completely misrepresenting me and my words and my history...but hey..that’s the world today RT @MarionSyversen: @adamhousley @tariqnasheed Sorry, Adam. This is an outrageous slander against you.
@tariqnasheed Rather than misrepresent me, why not contact me and find out the truth? You she completely taken what i said out of context and clearly you have never met me, or anyone who knows me.
@Bingelish Voting always matters. Even in the smallest elections.

@Bingelish OMG...stop taking words out of context. I have voted in every single election since 18. Jesse people. California was already chosen. That’s what I meant.
@dwajkhul You should just wear a sign next time that says “I’m a jackass” before opening your mouth and proving it.
Thanks! https://t.co/VbFylsZ78B
No...BUT...try the field blend. I think you'd like it if you like Merlot. :) https://t.co/gNWmgCsXyg
@MLB replay got it completely wrong. There was no question the fan was clearly leaning into the field of play. Why even have replay? @SFGiants
@dzurinko Oh I voted. Didn’t vote for either. I’ve never missed a vote. Even local school board stuff. I even sent one in from a war zone.
Thanks for the support https://t.co/vSqSLGFEkG
Thanks! Let us know after you taste it! https://t.co/k5sGJ4CZL9
thanks! https://t.co/CCTi4qvovZ
It will https://t.co/i01VxredGM
Would love to get into Texas. I played baseball there. I have a ton of family there. A ton of friends also. Need to get a distributor. https://t.co/JZS5xUf3Fk
Yep...didn't see it before https://t.co/JwZKrZa6Kz
No kidding https://t.co/nCBYhVYnl2
We don't make one...but I like a nice cold Moscato https://t.co/J14ZlKvDfP
I had no idea :) https://t.co/TsueVFgECT
It gets old. Every once in a while you gotta call it out cause someone new has some fake story to tell with no facts. Per Usual these days. https://t.co/teRbW4zl5b

Coaching soccer, Getting the family organized. Working the winery. :) https://t.co/7lVCsnZCx3
We don't do a Reisling. We have an estate cab, old zin, chard, rose, Field Blend, Petit Sirah and a Napa Cab   https://t.co/DA6xTlmps6 @Centuryoakwine https://t.co/mz7HrykAIQ
Meantime..back to wine. The harvest is looking good and is very soon. Will live feed it when it begins in a week or two.
yep https://t.co/RQKQp9AA5y
It's all a cover...lol https://t.co/HHhdyFOx7Z
Exactly. It's hysterical when people send me links and I see that there isn't one soundbite...one thing written...one fact. Cause their aint none. https://t.co/RbkildIp4A
OMG....shut up and unfollow then, What a ridiculous statement. It was because some lame individual made a lying video that is filled with complete lies. If I hadn't responded you would said silence speaks everything. GEEZE https://t.co/ndvzLyeIKT
Thanks Troy! https://t.co/5pNEfLwSXg
RT @Centuryoakwine: Excited to announce that @bevmo in California, Arizona and Washington are now carrying our Century Oak #chardonnay and the reds are coming soon! Check it out. An award winning Chard that is great cold at the end of the summer. #familywinery #centuryoakwinery
Yep RT @SlightlyBreezee: @adamhousley Everyone’s so caught up in the win/lose that they’ve forgotten about right/wrong, truth/lie.
That would be fun! RT @GoodlowLavenia: @adamhousley @LoniLove @TameraMowryTwo @TheRealDaytime @adamhousley and @TameraMowryTwo  when will you cook on the real?
Aaaaand my final tweet of the night cause I gotta get the kids up in a bit....watch the ladies on @TheRealDaytime They get up at 4am and bust their butts at work every day. These are 4 strong women who come from all walks of life and are amazing people
Whats wrong right now in this country is we focus on the image and not the substance. We focus on the fake and not the real. Nobody seems to care about fact and rumors abound. We have become too comfortable.
My daughter is being taught to be a strong woman. One who comes from amazing families with diverse backgrounds. My son is being taught to be a strong man. One who comes from diverse backgrounds and amazing families.
Again...feel free to refer to me previous tweets to answer any questions...also feel free to post when any troll or anyone who has never been in the same state as me or my wife decides to spew rumors and crap disguised as fact. geeze
so now...move on.
By the way...responding to all the crap...just to get it over with and on record.
No I am not racist, or insensitive, or any other crap you spew. Yes I love people from all walks of life. I love to cook, be with my kids, coach soccer, tell stories, music of all types, people of all types.
In California it didn't matter, so no need to choose. Also...at Fox I worked in something called THE NEWS DIVISION. I covered fires...about 50...hurricanes..11...tsunamis 2...War Zones 3...Earthquakes 5....terror attacks&amp; shootings..1 is too many
This is just for clarification so if you see any stupid people spewing lies...per usual...have them refer to this tweet. @TameraMowryTwo and I did not support Trump or Hillary and nowhere has there ever been anything said to prove such.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand @LoniLove better be nice to @TameraMowryTwo or I ain’t cookin! @TheRealDaytime
Good luck to my sisters on @TheRealDaytime and their first live show today of the new season! Knock it out @TameraMowryTwo @LoniLove @AdrienneBailon @jeanniemai we will ALL be watching :)
Thanks for the support. Would love to look into it. RT @RolandSprewell: @adamhousley @iMaGiNeprints Maaaan Adam! Could we use some good investigative reporting. Nothing but crickets from the Texas Rangers and the DPD Chief!
Exactly RT @iMaGiNeprints: @adamhousley There is something that does not add up with her story... just use common sense. If she mistaken a upstairs apt from her downstairs apartment, she has some very serious problems &amp; should not be wearing a badge or carrying a gun.
Me too RT @kembageorge: @adamhousley Whether the officer was right or wrong, if they’re pointing a loaded gun at me and yelling, I’m complying, then suing after the fact
I am a big supporter of law enforcement overall and know many men and women behind a badge that do amazing work...but...not when you walk into someone else’s apartment for no reason. RT @c5hardtop1999: @adamhousley Officers are 24/7.
Still trying to figure out why a person has to comply with verbal commands from an off duty officer inside their own apartment. Not gonna get political. Just think about that for a second.
Thanks for the support :) RT @menolady: @adamhousley Miss seeing you during this hurricane reporting but I’m betting you don’t miss it at all. #Retirement
The first step in recovery...everyone now...is admitting you have a problem. Do I need to bring John into this? I mean seriously...She tries to order gadgets before they are available and wants me to call and make the order. Just buy Apple Greta. https://t.co/uw7OJXwxU8
I think @greta could buy Apple .... she might as well
Greta clearly has too much time on her hands and too many gadgets to opine on RT @greta: @adamhousley is a gadget addict...I bet he gets the new iPhone and Apple Watch even though he does not need either :) He can’t control himself when it comes to buying gadgets - he need help
See the problem is this...a massive portion of this country doesn’t know what to believe anymore. News has become completely political. Sure blame and point fingers....hypocrisy is everywhere
@trump020 So I got people who hate me because hey claim I voted for Trump and people like you who suggest that I am anti Trump. Lol....that’s means I did my job just right. Neither side has any idea...and that’s the point.
Why have replay for MLB when they clearly miss a big call like the one in the Giants Braves game today. Belt clearly had toe on the bag. Made the game longer and got it wrong in the process @SFGiants #sfgiants #mlb
Sure there are always power struggles..with this group I’m told about 10 RT @gwhinton: @adamhousley @SharylAttkisson said her sources say it goes back 10-20 yrs.
RT @TameraMowryTwo: Who knew we had a Petite Sirah at Housley’s #CenturyOakWinery🍷 REPOST @adamhousley: Tamera tries our #petitesirah yes...we have an amazing...and new...Petite Sirah. Harvest is just around… https://t.co/LiUun4ZmCf @Centuryoakwine
What people need to understand and the mainstream doesn’t report...the FBI issues were internal and began before Trump. It was about power and control and the group wanting that power and control wasn’t large, but they had authority and they took it out on their fellow agents
Final tweet of the night....2,996 killed...including the 19 terrorists who are rotting in hell right now...countless others have died from the after effects. Our prayers are with you..with your familes...with your friends. #NeverForget911
Trevor doesn't always get it right..but on this one...I gotta agree. Not sure why he's like that tho. https://t.co/LGjGClx8YY
We need to remember these times and come together as one to address our problems as one. https://t.co/wXjCMIeLqT
The full story of McCabe v. Flynn hasn't been revealed. Now with rumors circling of indictments in DC and several now well known names being mentioned...including McCabe...this is gonna remain ugly in DC
@MsMaleaG Before you criticize. Read my timeline.
And...I was looking at what’s trending in the western U.S. and 9/11 was not on the list. Really? We must not allow ourselves to blindly forget and focus on what not matters.
The Republicans politicized #benghazi and their investigations were aimed mostly at Clinton. She and the State Department had major fault, but the Republicans were at fault for not allowing the investigation to also go in other directions. The Dems just didn’t care at all
We were doing stuff in Libya. Both parties knew it. As I reported...American special forces hunted down at least 20 terrorists responsible for the #benghazi attack twice in the first 6 months. Twice! Yet nothing was done. To this day none of the main culprits has been punished
Yep. Sad. RT @IndyCardFan2: @adamhousley We may remember 9/11 but it’s painfully obvious that we’ve forgotten the bond of being Americans together on 9/12.
We must also not forget that Americans were attacked and left hanging in #Benghazi remember we never showed up. We didn’t even evacuate our dead and injured. Kinda a big deal. The Republicans politicized the investigations &amp; didn’t look in certain places, the Dems dismissed it
Time may heal, but only the weak will forget. We cannot forget those lost that day, or forget that evil exists. Do not let your guard down America. We are too busy bashing each other. #neverforget #remember9/11
True RT @big62dady: @adamhousley They have enough to keep up, they have to fine tune.
Man the 49ers have had 4 chances to put it in the end zone and have two drops, one fumble and an overthrow. Ugh
@marasaidso @McKenziRaye_ People can have views about anything...and it can go the other way around. The insinuations are also unacceptable.
Gonna be weird for sure RT @Gerryinpa: @adamhousley A hurricane in the Atlantic Are you glad you won't be there or will you miss it just a little? We will miss you
Yep that’s scientific. It’s also quite possible to make complete crap up. RT @marasaidso: @adamhousley @McKenziRaye_ It's quite possible to harbor ill views for black people, for example. But see a spouse or friend as different..."not like the others". Happens often.
Thanks for the support. The fact that people even debate this and can throw out a ludicrous accusation is exactly what is wrong in this country right now https://t.co/opSnRFCrvI
Get the stupidity sent to me every day. Every once in a while I call it out...just to remind people that evil exists...sometimes its masked by stupidity and/or ignorance https://t.co/ZMflYwtHqm

And the winner of the new idiot of the day goes to....drumroll....this clown. #enjoyyoirsadlife RT @McKenziRaye_: Being married to a person of another race doesn’t automatically make you not racist. (Example: Adam Housley &amp; Tamera Mowry)
Thanks for the support in both careers :). RT @MsJava1972: @adamhousley From someone who used to watch you as a Brewer, I am going to miss you in FOX
Last official day at Fox. Thank you to everyone at the network who supported me over the years and gave me the opportunity to see the world and cover news. Thanks also to all of you for watching and supporting. #muchappreciated #alwaysareporter
@HistorianMom Understood. Kinda hard to omit the flag planting tho....may not be the pinnacle point of the movie, but a massive planting for the country and world.
@sarahroderick Absolutely he was a hero waaaaaay before the moon landing.
Did the movie ‘First Man’ really omit the American Flag being planted on the moon? Just a reminder to whoever made that decision...President Kennedy challenged America to beat the communists...oh and we did. Just wish I was alive to experience it.
@sdwinkler Nope. Just put it out there to see if anyone is paying attention...especially when folks in the media try to make Antifa racial.
Exactly. RT @sdwinkler: @adamhousley They're dressed in black. There's that.
Just a thought...before you label antifa...maybe you should go to a rally. I covered 4 or 5.
https://t.co/SUaO3OuyWG     @Centuryoakwine
@akd66 @NizarAdeeb Not confirming. Didn’t realize one was attached. Nizar is a friend from overseas and I retweetee his support
Then he will lie at the Capital in DC. RT @MikeEmanuelFox: Before Senator McCain's body comes to Washington, he will be honored by his beloved adopted home state of Arizona-&gt;
Jacksonville...another one. Makes me sick. Meantime people are posting the video and audio and even the guys profiles and pictures. Don’t you think that’s what this sick person wanted? Why give that to him, even if he is now rotting in H?
24 countries and 22 states for Fox RT @carol_karylii: @adamhousley Loved watching you report! From everywhere!!
Exactly. You don’t. Heck I don’t even know it. RT @NotSoGraceful26: The best thing about @adamhousley is that you don't know his political affiliation.
Honored. Thank you. RT @DiggsRay2: @adamhousley As a 20-year journalism vet and a consumer you are the reason why I switched to Fox News blessings on to you my brother
Thank you. Always enjoyed reporting for your show and the support by your staff was always top notch. RT @cvpayne: Adam   You are and have always been a class act.  All the best to you and your family.
This is how I know I kept it down the middle. I have people like this...and I also have people claiming I ran the ball for the President...sooooo yeah....people we are a mess right now RT @Kennie70428335: @willdit @adamhousley @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC UR WERE ALWAYS CNN AND MSNBC
@mattsmom221 @deborahann770 Didn’t blame the President. Didn’t blame anyone. Just left for my kids and other opportunities on good terms. Someone else decided to make it political. Got it?
@RenoBola https://t.co/DA6xTlmps6
No way! John was always so good to me. Will look it up RT @RichardHallin: @adamhousley FWIW. . . John Gibson gave you a very nice tribute on his podcast.
I remember!! Such a fun day RT @CPMailes: @adamhousley - congrats on a successful career! From the amateur dude that shot your Blue Angels ride.
Thank you and I’ll still keep my ear to the ground RT @ttm1976: @adamhousley You were and still are a great journalist.
@RhondaMel2016 @MeghanMcCain So sorry to hear
Thoughts with my former colleague Meghan McCain and her family @meghanmccain
RIP John McCain. First time I ever interviewed him was in Pakistan. Memorable moment in my journalism career.
@ryanstyles We need to do a reunion with the guys
Thank you and love the wording :) RT @ksumn04: @adamhousley I want to hear the balls and strikes of a story and that's what you do!! If its a hit or an out depends on the count. Thank you! Much luck
:) gotta her my new kit! RT @CFCInAmerica: @adamhousley You’re not Fox anymore but you’re still Chelsea.  And that (along with being a good father and wanting to spend more time with your family and raising your kids and being a good human being) is what’s important.
Thank you RT @LisaDaftari: Ray of sunshine at the @FoxNews LA Bureau... Always so nice bumping into the talented &amp; energetic, @adamhousley. Wishing you best in this next chapter!
Clint it was always a pleasure. :) RT @ClintPHenderson: Glad I got to work with you @adamhousley - Good luck with your new adventures!
Lol that was a loooooong time ago! RT @redbaran684: @adamhousley @tayl_elle Ever since I saw you in a Elvis Halloween Costume,I have been hooked. Love your excellent reporting and you will be missed. Best of luck to you.
Thank you and I’d love that RT @AtchisonJeff: @adamhousley Adam, you represent what Journalism should be. Your on air reports will be missed by me and many others. Hope we can do lunch when things calm down a bit.
Memorable trip RT @eronlindsey: @adamhousley first time I saw you was in the desert with the troops. Always enjoyed your reporting since then.  Good luck in future endeavors.
You guys and Dana are pure class and I always enjoyed reporting for your show RT @Rocco_FNC: @adamhousley Best of luck, Adam! It was great working with you on the @dailybriefing!
Wow. Thank you for the support RT @Billy_trouble: #thereal story is that @adamhousley has such a diverse portfolio that he will do well @TheRealDaytime
Thanks!!   Century Oak Wine is solid and affordable RT @MacKimBo: @adamhousley Hm, family/wine vs news...uh, duh, 🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷 /👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 family everyday, but mostly 🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷🍷. Just tried one of your wines=very nice piquant!  😜
@amanda_0127 @elmotweet Thank you and man that was a long time ago. Time flies.
@RonRigdon @MrsRigdon It was great meeting you guys and I am sure our paths will cross again
Every reporter I know will say we need more reporting RT @CiscoTec: @adamhousley @brithume Wife &amp; I have always thought the world of your "delivery".  You always have that flair of urgency.  I do agree with your message on "in studio opinion heads".  Far too much of that.
So true RT @Michael2014abc: @adamhousley Incredible what you've covered from 2001 to now. Imagine how much has changed. You've had an incredible opportunity. What a great experience.
Always love me some @ranchmarketsnv RT @anneofalamo: @adamhousley @brithume Was always a little thrill to hear your name. Many fun years spent in napa, and ranch market. You done good, and be proud of your work.
Drafter by the #expos and played in the minors for the Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers RT @Cubsfan365: @adamhousley hey Adam who did you play professional baseball for and what was your position
https://t.co/SUaO3OuyWG. RT @chalackey: @adamhousley what’s the winery name?
@dt007 @wsvn @FoxNews Thank you and to everyone at WSVN who always took our stories wherever we were around the globe. Much appreciated.
I’ll be tweeting and on Instagram and on YouTube just not about this anymore RT @tayl_elle: @adamhousley Very happy for you! But keep tweeting so we can keep up with the Housley’s!
@JannaDyck I will always remember their friendship
And final comment on this. My statement speaks for itself and as soon as this hurricane collapses I can’t wait to hug my kids and my amazing wife, have an amazing glass of wine and coach soccer. Proud of my friends, family and career this far.
Some news numbers for you. 24 countries. 22 states...more than 1100 nights on the road. Some of the biggest stories of our time. It was a blessing. I will miss it and my colleagues. Behind the camera and in front. Many lifelong friends. Here’s a shocker. From all networks too
Now this is what I wanna debate about on your show! RT @Dave1037TheGame: @adamhousley Yeah,  but what do you think of the A’s chances of getting to the postseason?
Getting some time to see all this spin has me wanting to make one thing clear. Fox gave me amazing opportunities. I am not bashing them on the way out. For you partisans, look at my news reporting. I have 17 years of solid fair work. My coverage speaks for itself.
I did my best RT @ghartman02: @adamhousley @jmem5601 For what it's worth, thank you. A rarity in media today, you were pretty down the middle.
Exactly RT @SandyBell710: @adamhousley @jmem5601 Very sad when you need to give anyone an explanation. I'm going to miss you tremendously, but family always comes first. No one should question your decision.
What people don’t care to understand..a correspondent is an amazing job, but seeing history from the front row means you miss a ton. Not a complaint, a fact. I’ve spent more than 1100 nights on the road at Fox. Incredible opportunity. Now not as important as my family.
I am leaving because I want to raise my kids and not leave them with a nanny. RT @jmem5601: @adamhousley that's all I'm seeing all over twitter and email is you're leaving because Fox News is too conservative.
The state of the media/politics today. Take my statement out of context. Use my leaving for family as a political pawn or jab. Assign quotes and statements to me that I never said. Yep. And both sides in this political battle whine over the collapse of news.
Thank you RT @CarmiOnTheVerge: @MichaelRCaputo @adamhousley No one does a hurricane like Adam Housley! @FoxNews
The surf is getting rough on Maui and we have gotten some intermittent heavy rain with more in sight https://t.co/wcBXW1bfvg
Thank you RT @SharNeal: @adamhousley  @FoxNews   I have also found Adam professional &amp; fair I hope he has a great future I will miss his reports
Winery is in Lodi and we grow in Napa and Lodi. We are open every Saturday and Sunday   https://t.co/IpXhSoBYYa RT @SaarioBrandon: @adamhousley @GeraldoRivera Where is your winery and is it open to the public?
@MollyLineFNC Thanks Molly and very much appreciated
That will happen for sure. Go Blues! RT @LAChelseaBlues: @adamhousley More time to join us for an early morning Chelsea match then! Yay!
@GeraldoRivera You are still the unofficial mayor of #yountville California and need to bring Erica and come visit your people
@cassielaverne Lol. Can’t wait for a glass of vino and my next soccer practice. The website is    https://t.co/SUaO3OuyWG
I have been covering Hurricane Lane non stop and worried about my friends in Hawaii as we all should. Responding to rumors and misinformation about my decision to leave Fox has not been a priority &amp; isn’t. My statement speaks for itself. Now back to my job of reporting the news
Can’t lose that invite. :) RT @jbizzyxo: @adamhousley Maybe one day bro. Meanwhile u still a good dude and u are invited to the cookout.
@ILO3 @Bourgy Thank you
Back to news which is what I do: #hurricanelane is now down to a Category 2 storm. Rough surf on Maui. No wind really. Very little rain so far.
So true. People don’t get it. RT @Valleymomm: @adamhousley Folks don't realize how working in news can take away time from family. My husband has missed so much.
Exactly RT @jeannetredway: @adamhousley You did a fantastic job ! I will greatly miss your reporting actual news stories with a true passion for every story you did. Enjoy your family, jobs can come and go but your children will only be little once and it goes by so fast.
People...I’m still gonna tweet. I still get stories and love news and will stay connected, just with a whistle in my mouth during practice and a glass of wine in my hand once the kids go down 🍷
Meantime...thank you to the massive amount of tweets of support. Thank you for watching me and our crews cover news. Did the best I could to get as much honest and accurate info as possible. #fondmemories for sure
Shocking. My leaving Fox News quickly gets political on Twitter. Yep..the sad world we live in. I’m sure gonna enjoy that glass of wine while the polarized in this country duke it out. Maybe one day...one day we can find common ground first rather than just call names
@BeccaO @greta @ASEDawg89 @troyhaydenfox10 I’m not leaving Twitter! :)
https://t.co/DA6xTlmps6 RT @ftwaynefeds: @adamhousley @troyhaydenfox10 Where is the winery?
Would love to do that. RT @raylopez640: @adamhousley Is the absolute best in the business.  Most importantly, a very nice human being.  Hope to get you on with @johnandkenshow on @KFIAM640 to talk about the good times!  Bring some wine !
I’ll still tweet and stay on top of things! Kinda like @greta RT @ASEDawg89: @troyhaydenfox10 @adamhousley I am so going to miss Adam on fox and his tweets.  He is one I trust but best of luck to him and his family!
Thank you as always RT @greta: It is a bummer for you. @adamhousley is a great journalist and I hope some day he returns to journalism. He is honest...gives it to you like it is.
Always appreciated your support and Susan and everyone from the blog RT @SYLVIAinOH: @greta @adamhousley Greta, you are the one who introduced many of us to Adam when you had your blog.
Thank you RT @MsRandiD: @greta @adamhousley I remember earlier this summer when he was reporting on the wildfires &amp; there was one happening by his family's place. I could see stuff like that making you think about things like family. I wish The Housleys much success &amp; love.
The pics from that day are hysterical...and worthy of blackmail :) RT @greta: .@adamhousley even coached me to prepare me for throwing out the first pitch for the Mets; we practiced during down times at the Michael Jackson trial;
@johnnydollar01 History now clearly shows us he was wrong in a big way
@malrandi @FNC_Ladies_Rule @FoxNews Always remember our time in #kuwait fondly. The people of Kuwait were so supportive of me and my crew and so welcoming
@troyhaydenfox10 Thanks Troy...always enjoy doing reports for you guys because you guys asked questions :)
Thank you and to everyone for all the support. RT @FNC_Ladies_Rule: Best of luck to @adamhousley in his new endeavors! Adam did a great job at @FoxNews all these years!
Lol. We need to taste some of the new wine together. RT @RobStutzman: . @adamhousley in his element (Other than his tasting room)
It may look serene, but the wind has kicked up and the seas are rough. Can #hurricanelane just peel off a bit more. Seriously...there’s a whole ocean out there wide open. https://t.co/HqKrCQZOHW
Thanks James https://t.co/XfbDYI3KLs
Headed to #hurricanelane my 11th cane and like everyone hoping it peels off and wind sheer takes it out. He can go play out in the Pacific by himself !
While we are on foreign policy. It seems nobody is noticing that China is doing whatever it can to take away Taiwan’s allies. I’ve been to both countries. Amazing people in both. Hope the international community can find a way for both to succeed independent of each other
@_zayt Would love to. Not sure if it will happen tho. Whats happened in Yemen is brutal and most have no idea.
As I’ve said from day 1..this goes deeper and crosses the political aisle, yet both parties are entrenched RT @FoxNews @TomFitton: "The only person who got money directly from Russia as far as I could tell running for office in 2016 was @HillaryClinton." https://t.co/avBWbm2Ghe

Thank you RT @mswitmore: @adamhousley @GRYKING God bless you Adam and ur family, God knowsur heart thats all that matters🙏🏾
There are stupid people and stupid comments...but when both are out together...you get the dumbest tweet of the year. Congrats. RT @GRYKING: Adam Housley is using Tamera and his kids as a shield for his racism.
Unmasking is and was not fictional. Only if you are partisan. RT @ShamansWell: @adamhousley It’s not funny Adam. You helped push a story that was fictional and had no comment when it was found to be fictional.
@ShamansWell Lol. Had nothing to do with party. Nice try. Also you are comparing apples to oranges. The unmasking that went on should concern all Americans regardless of party and as I reported, which you clearly didn’t care to mention, it was all about power. Period.
@BruceC76 @greta Thank you
Yep RT @carol_karylii: @adamhousley Amazing how you have been around the world, and notice the silliness of LA! #keeplivinthegoodlife
@greta Yes you were one of em! But you are a bad gadget influence on me...
Thunder right now in LA...that's about as normal as a day without traffic. Or walking through Bev Hills without seeing new lips. #justdoesnthappen
It’s open now!!  RT @Centuryoakwine: Tasting room opens in 10 mins!! Come on in! Pouring 6 wines. 🤩#lodiwine #lodiwinecountry
I wasn’t born today....August 13th....I just love Friday the 13th’s
It’s #fridaythe13th and I was born on Friday the 13th. Love this day. Explains a lot.
Ooooooooooh brother. Man those were good times! How u doin Tim?  RT @leg12tim: @adamhousley @Dave1037TheGame  https://t.co/QdncsqSGqP
Love this RT @CoachTimHall: @Dave1037TheGame @leg12tim Wait a min, just seeing @leg12tim tagged in this. Wow, who else can we tag besides @adamhousley?!
This Isner Anderson match at #wimbledon2018 is unreal right now. They've been playing this set since before our interns were born.
@Dave1037TheGame @leg12tim Boom !!
@BaylorCoachRod @greta I think Greta should fly me and we can watch a Baylor baseball game with Tam, John and the kids!
That was as Greta responded to me right now. RT @FoundinNV: @greta @adamhousley  https://t.co/c94h7WKOEY
@greta @ericbayloru I will lose this argument with Greta....but in actuality I win because @BaylorCoachRod is a good friend of mine and former teammate and that means you have no choice but to be on my side.
Agreed on electing different people for sure. :) BUT disagree....your gadget problem is much worse than mine. It seriously needs an intervention...as I shop online for for more "stuff" https://t.co/7sB67rZBsQ
I love you too....but they have fundamentally changed how our reps act. These hearings have become completely useless. We didn't have em for about 200 years with no problem. :)  Also..you have a gadget problem https://t.co/DQLvpqsvnd
Strzok admitted he sent controversial texts on FBI devices and on FBI time. Which....causes more arguing/interrupting on both sides.
@jbowers10 @maryhelen104 I didn’t say close hearings to journalists, but cameras change everything. Clearly.
Strzok says that Russian collusion would be the gravest threat to democracy...Then did this become concern #1? Was there a full assault on Russia, or any country doing this? These are answers we need to know as Americans.
Absolutely....abolish cameras in Congress. RT @jbowers10: @adamhousley I said it before and I’ll say it again.  If you want to eliminate drama and grandstanding simply take the cameras away
@ACCroney All of it
Also interruptions....on both sides....I'd already be passed out.
"I have been recommended by the counsel of the FBI not to answer that question" If I was still in college this would be a great drinking game.
Have we even gotten past question 1?
Interesting that #strzok is represented at the hearing by both his own attorney's and FBI attorneys
I have a #pointoforder over the argument over the #pointoforder
Wow....this is exactly why Americans don't pay attention to politics.
Goodlatte is demanding an answer and has a Supreme Court decision already prepared for his argument...Nadler may be better than a Strzok defense attorney.
This may be the best prediction of the week. https://t.co/5hFjoy7VZl
Watching reps on both sides of the aisle...read prepared statements about objections...just reminds me how this whole hearing is already planned out. We once again won't get any answers. Just both parties grandstanding.
Hopefully justice will FINALLY be served https://t.co/z3YUz77DX9
Anyone know why agent Dalton is sitting near Strzok...and he also sat near Wray when he testified?
Take 2 seconds and vote for my buddy Brandon Belt @bbelt9 of the @SFGiants only a few hours left to get him in plus his wife is due with their second baby! Now you gotta do it. :) UNLIMITED VOTING until 1pm today #BeltTheBallot: https://t.co/Y4W0IzVOqJ https://t.co/JQClgJNCv3
As someone said it best...not all superheroes wear capes. In Thailand they are wearing scuba gear. Prayers for the boys, their families and the divers who are risking everything to bring em out alive. I was in Chile, nothing can describe what these people are feeling right now.

Thank you RT @wifeofmusic: @TameraMowryTwo i finally saw your @hgtv show with @adamhousley , you guys are SO cute and i love your designs!!!
@GonzaloMarginet We must! I too was a bit bummed that all South American teams are out. BUT...my pick from the beginning has been Belgium 🇧🇪
I know :( https://t.co/uZgIvxzZ3Y
@GonzaloMarginet We should all go together! :)
You gotta go to HGTV to find out. It was a one time special. :) https://t.co/v7BZ4j25d0
20 seconds left in extra time and Belgium puts it away. What a match! Japan played fantastic. Belgium I still think is the team to beat. #WorldCup2018
What is going on with FIFA?!  How is that not a red card?! I love both of these teams/countries...but wow. This is a mess. #WorldCup18
The FIFA War Room is a joke. Ramos was accosted on the kick in the box.
I know. I heard. This blows. Loved that place. RT @Ultprinses: @adamhousley did you hear the sad news? I know the #fremontdiner was one of your favorites. https://t.co/7HprE1RwyL
Thank you. You would know and Griff rocks RT @greta: I wish Fox News would send @AdamHousley or @GriffJenkins to #Rohingya refugee camp;both Adam and Griff are great in the field and care about people and thus Fox audience would learn more about this ethnic cleansing crisis..
lol https://t.co/omSNGLKwct
Neymar should get a yellow for that acting job That's what FIFA needs to eliminate from the game. The fairness of injury or four is annoying.
I know! RT @CoachTimHall: @adamhousley Maybe so, cause remember that TX lotto ticket you had where you were off by one on every number?
Thank you. I honestly do my best to be fair. RT @ibxnj1961: @adamhousley Adan,you are one the few HONEST people in the media
Yep RT @IndyCardFan: @adamhousley You have a beautiful wife and amazing family. That’s the best kind of lottery to win.
@SacRepublicFC scores first in #lamarhuntcup game against #lafc 😀👍
I didn’t say whether the EO was right or wrong..I’ve been reporting for years about the problems along the border and in Latin America..both parties have failed to make changes. I just guessed there would be an EO today. Maybe I shoulda bought a lottery ticket too.
Did I not say there needed to be an executive order?
Common Ground....it CAN be found. It's easier to find our commonalities than our differences. We have so much more in common than not.
Thank you! RT @JillRyanMSP: @adamhousley @WineSpectator @TameraMowryTwo What a gorgeous place! And the view is unbelievable!
@Centuryoakwine featured!!  RT @WineSpectator: TV power couple @TameraMowryTwo and @AdamHousley have carved out a #wine lover's sanctuary in Northern California. See photos of their dream kitchen and cellar! https://t.co/1dOaMgoD0d
I don’t know RT @SYLVIAinOH: @adamhousley Adam, I wish there was an easy fix for this horrible situation. We must stop the illegal immigration and at the same time be humane. The grandstanding Congress needs to put their political issues aside and work together. Is that possible?
@M5Harmon I politically can’t, don’t and won’t stand with either party. I’ve also seen and covered the immigration issue on both sides of the border throughout Mexico and in Central America. No easy answers, but there are answers..the kids are the ones throughout all of this I care about
A huge Thank You to the #winespectator love my hometown wine country RT @WineSpectator: TV power couple @TameraMowryTwo and @AdamHousley have carved out a #wine lover's sanctuary in Northern California. See photos of their dream kitchen and cellar! https://t.co/1dOaMgoD0d
Now..we have this. The whole thing makes me sick. We can do better. We must do better. What will it finally take for enough people to put party and politics aside and just do the damn right thing? There are no easy answers...but there are answers.
I remember talking with Tony Snow in his office about the border and the massive problems with our immigration system. A reminder....BOTH parties have had the Presidency and controlled Congress at the same time since then...neither got anything of note done
Meantime...Poland versus Senegal in 8 mins. Might be cool for parents to have their kids search each country online as the match begins...for background and location. Might learn a bit about the rest of the world.
I'm glad to see there's no grandstanding at this hearing.
@AynRiedel98 I’ll post it and my unmasking stories.
@AynRiedel98 Nope. I did when I heard about it. I didn’t make this political and could care less about party
After watching the FBI hearing today..and as an American..and a reporter...I want agents to talk. How else will we know there are problems, or issues? Clearly not talking has allowed a few to wield power and control internally over many others and resulted in this.
It was always a one time special....tho we had a blast doing it! https://t.co/4BiYa63pjY
@CFCInAmerica It's a great drinking game for sure.
My sleeper for this tourney has...and is..the dutch. #Belgium is tough.
I LOVE soccer/futbol. Was recruited out of high school, so I know the game. However...I thought FIFA was going to do something about the writhing in pain actions of some players. While it has gotten a tad better, it is still annoying as heck #WorldCup18

Just a reminder. It was more than a year ago I broke unmasking and at the time reported there was more to this issue and it wasn’t about party politics. It was about power and a small group of people in non elected positions and agencies didn’t care which party. Just power.
He is more than welcome to hang! It would be a blast. RT @Mike_Caudill: So, @AdamKlotzFNC wants to ride. What do you think @adamhousley? Time to get you both on an @indianmotorcycle!
So for 11 years why hasn't the U.S. done more to bring FBI Agent Bob Levinson home? How did we make a deal without his release? Something doesn't add up here.
Great year for the Pepperdine guys! @PeppBaseball wins the WCC..while Coach Waz @PurdueBaseball and Coach Rod @BaylorBaseball are headed to conference tourneys also and in the top 30. Very cool.

Busy night on the Housley TV and iPad. @SanJoseSharks @warriors @SFGiants and @SacRepublicFC all with games/matches. I need a good ipa
So far a much better effort and game by @SanJoseSharks lets do this!
You are correct. We were the first with this report &amp; more to it. RT @x__JB_x  The original report about Susan Rice involvement came out from Adam Housley on April 3rd or 4th of 2017. Man, it seems like so much longer ago... I think you're right about this being the genesis
Agents and former agents who want to talk...or who have RT @7bestoftimes: @adamhousley @Dsnicol2 who is the "them"?
For those of us investigating this and unmasking...we could care less about the President or either party for that matter. They all annoy me. It’s about finding truth and ensuring that America works as fairly as possible.
Congress has to protect them and right now they’ve done a poor job doing that RT @Dsnicol2: @adamhousley In order for us to know that the mass majority of FBI agents are great is if they speak up.
What’s clear in the interview...no consistency in rules and no consistency in actions.
What people need to realize is that the mass majority of agents in the bureau are fantastic at their jobs and make our lives safer. But...this group...which I suspect is highlighted in the IG report...was all about power and this control had been going on for some time
The Bret interview with Comey has me asking more questions than I had before. Wonder what agents feel about it?
That would have been a great drinking game interview
Wow Comey says McCabe still “stood tall” even after Bret asked him about the IG report which says McCabe lies under oath 3 times. Comey says McCabe wasn’t candid.
@BretBaier is fairly questioning and pressing Comey the way more in our industry should have. He’s not taking a political side, just getting the facts. Solid work so far.
Comey seemed to brush past the fact that a computer with sensitive emails was not being acted on and the NY office of the FBI wanted to know why DC wasn’t acting on such an important piece of evidence
Comey just told @BretBaier that he’s not sure if the FBI was slow walking the Weiner computer. Though he just admitted the bureau had it for some time and that it took a call to the DOJ to “poke” the FBI to move on it?

@Ritapp1905 @Ssm39610 actually I do. Stuff was known and told before the investigation. A lot of it has since been out in the public domain.
@dyslecix @studuncan @BradMossEsq they need to win tomorrow!
It’s amazing how people demand reporting and then do what they can to twist and politicize it when they think it doesn’t fit their narrative. Last time I mention it. Don’t follow me then if you think I am a propagandist...you’d be wrong. Way wrong.
@jdbatts79 nothing was leaked
@matthewjsinger @mattyo6767 not true
@jdbatts79 never met Sarah. No idea. I know I’ve reported on damn good work by the FBI for 16 years. I was also their keynote speaker in the West for the 100 year anniversary.
Thank you and I know ughRT @thesonx: @adamhousley You're an excellent reporter.  The interviews you're able to get with people who just experienced a tragedy are always top notch.  It's too bad it seems like we only get to see you when something bad happens.
@Ssm39610 man you people don’t give up. Knowing the recommendation isn’t knowing the report. Geeze.
@dyslecix @studuncan @BradMossEsq go blues!
So go ahead...throw your stones. Stake your partisan flag. I can take it. Just know...I have no horse in this race. I just want the horse race to survive and to thrive...for all of us..no matter race, politics, gender, or sexual preference.
I know this. Our news division is honest and strong and hardworking and while I don’t contribute to our opinion shows, they have every right to opine. It’s also what’s great about American..whether I agree with them or not. I stick to facts as best I can
We’ve seen horrible things, watched humanity rise and then come home to try and grasp it ourselves. From tsunamis to wars to miners coming out of the ground alive..we cover news. I know you like to rip us and that’s what’s great about America..it’s your right to do so
For the haters..just take 2 secs to read this. For 16 years I’ve covered every damn tragedy known to man, war zones and news stories around the globe. The men and women I work with in the news division are some of the most hardworking honest people I know

Call me partisan all you want. For years I have been just an issue guy and just wanting truth. I support those I work with and those serving justly for us. That simple. I have no allegiance to party, candidate or politician. I believe some and don’t believe others.
Just a reminder....there was an internal investigation by fellow agents. If you think this was political and not factual...then you must then condemn the whole agency and it’s processes. I am not going to do that. The FBI does massively important work by thousands of agents
@BradMossEsq no..they leaked nothing. They told me once it was complete. Reaction also isn’t leaking...and neither is witnessing.
@zeppo_99 @gobluesurf @MGoKirby yep you’re wrong. That simple.
I did it again!! It was my app correcting me..but this time I caught it and corrected it...just an FYI to the grammar police :)
Funny thing I haven’t read and won’t read anything the Pres or Comey tweets..even tho I have people telling me to do so. I couldn’t care less what they think..this is about facts and the internal investigation did that and hopefully the IG report will as well
@Bryan_Mills_ lol
@danjs1975 lol...as I said earlier...I was cooking and tweeting one handed
@4Chuck let’s hope so.
Funny how extreme partisans on both sides see my reporting. They are drinking two different cups of Kool Aid
@zeppo_99 @gobluesurf @MGoKirby lol. Yep I run the ball for the right. Clearly you don’t know me...and I am guilty of retreating my colleagues work. So yes...I shouldn’t support my coworkers. My bad.
Thank you RT @LT51552424: @flannery_jp @seanmdav @adamhousley has a good take for perspective on this tonight
Thanks RT @RonRigdon: @lrpinkoff @adamhousley Amen!! Adam Housley is a class act!
@doctagee you are incorrect. McCabe was not popular. I didn’t mention Comey...you did.
@JackPosobiec @AngelinaSteveTX thank you
@Carpophores @Serafinos @uteagogo we had reported McCabe’s issues before tonight.
It did RT @lsforsbBacMan: @adamhousley @JackPosobiec we never said it was all Democrats, its just that the majority of these people were, in fact, Democrats.  We already know it was a clique. But this clique did a lot of damage, didn't it?
@AngelinaSteveTX @JackPosobiec lol. You read the surface and seem to know the depths.
@MarkMaiwurds I am saying this started before that. What they did and what it became will be revealed in the full report.
@SummerTorres89 I am saying agents have told me of a small group of people we’re all about control and they were even tough on their own internally. It had agents not wanting to talk and it started before Trump.
As a reporter I will repeat this once more. I could care less if this helps Trump, or helps politically in any way. I just know a ton of men and women in the FBI who do damn good work and they were watching how this clique would be handled. McCabe has many who do not support
Happy RT @HappyGoldenRule: @adamhousley Are they mad or happy about the firing?
@KayoteUgly1 agreed in th second half of your statement
@JXMcQ @al_quartemont  it many of us
@uteagogo I carry the ball for no one. If you follow me you know that. Otherwise you a put partisan spouting off.
This decision will encourage agents to trust coming forward. Others who had during the clique’s time in charge got buried and mistreated and it kept agents from coming forward. Again..this began before Trump. It was about control.
@uteagogo ok pal. Could care less. Don’t follow me then.
@uteagogo you are telling me the FBI OPR cares about Trumps tweets? Lol. It’s why I am reporting and not opining.
This was about power by a group within the FBI. A clique. I see Republicans already making this political and tying it in a much different way than it was. Dems tying it to Trump...both would be wrong.
I am told yesterday McCabe felt the heat and went to try and save his last two days and even told some he would take people down with him if he as fired. So...let’s see what comes of this. I know this...a ton of agents...a ton...were watching this very closely.
Wray and McCabe’s meeting did not go well and it was McCabe who challenged the Director. McCabe stepped down because of this and tried to ride it out until retirement. Truth internally came out before that happened. This has nothing to do with Trumps tweets or Nunes memo
@al_quartemont thanks Al
@calvindanielsll @debz526 @Put2sleep0066 could care less about Trump and Sessions. According to my sources, who are beyond question, there is much more. This isn’t about Trump. This was about control and business as usual for a few
And there is much more. But leave it to some of my colleagues in the media to immediately make it political.  RT @debz526: @calvindanielsll @Put2sleep0066 @adamhousley The totality of what McCabe has done hasn’t been disclosed to the public.
Thank you RT @Bothered_Blonde: He doesn’t get a lot of credit; but @adamhousley has been working on this story for a long time. He wasn’t playing politics, he was being a Journalist.
@TheCaringBot aaaaaaah yes. Sorry was cooking and tweeting. Thanks for the correction!
Working on that RT @agcarrington: @adamhousley I don’t believe anyone took this lightly and the FBI said he should be fired. Would like to hear from FBI employees and their opinion.
This is a reminder that you should do your job and be truthful and serve the agency and the people. I could care less ur politics. RT @vlfAKAfreebird: @adamhousley But do you think this is a warning to anyone who doesn’t have the integrity to serve? Should we continue to worry?
Again...this isn’t about politics..this was an internal thing that became political. It started before Trump. Both sides are tho going to make this political. I mean...that’s what they do.
McCabe had some friends as part of his group. Some have left...a few are still around. FYI
McCabe blaming Nunes and the dossier is beyond incorrect. The internal investigation took all that into consideration and much more. Ask the agents in the bureau, not the politicians and media outside of it. That’s what I did. They had a ton of stuff on him...a ton.
From day 1 I have said the McCabe issue was not about politics for agents. This began before Trump was elected and there are many who were watching how the Bureau handled him. Tonight...a message has been sent according to the agents I am speaking with. McCabe is our.
A bunch of FBI agents I know are watching how McCabe is handled very closely. For them this isn't political, it was about how things were handled internally.

Ron two of the ladies murdered had asked us to come back and do another story on Pathway. It’s hard to comprehend  RT @RonRigdon: @adamhousley Wow.  Sad story
@kir4110 it’s never an accolade to report news like this. Ever. Thank you for your support.
@geofftype you mean the fact that as a news reporter we were the first to highlight the amazing successes of Pathway Home 4 years ago?
@evenbev before you judge...understand I only report truth.
Very surreal to be standing her at the #veteranshome in #yountville ... a place where I grew up and a program that had done so much for so many. I can’t help but think of the families of the three women murdered...and all the men they had helped. #pathwayhome
Yes RT @hhsmmom: @adamhousley Wasn't this the place mentioned in Thank You For Your Service? A place for veterans to go to get help with PTSD?
Also the program #pathwayhome treats some of the most difficult cases of PTSD and had been amazingly successful. I profiled the program a few years ago for Fox
Sad to report the news in my hometown of #yountville dead bodies have been found

I agree. RT @Jhic709365: @adamhousley Adam, keep on this. I just want the truth wherever it leads and whoever it takes down. D or R, I don't care. I want the truth.
I always will. I will run no ball for either party, but I will fight for truth and to clean up this mess. RT @mikewarder1: @adamhousley Keep vigilant &amp; your judgment.
From DOJ Attorney cont: Then, the apparatus signed off on 3 subsequent renewals even though, by then, literally everyone in a position of responsibility knew all about the credibility issues.  Unbelievably frightening.
From a DOJ Attorney who has worked significant time with the FISA Court: they surveilled an American, didn’t tell the FISC that there were serious credibility problems.
Lol. BIG ALUMNi game tomorrow RT @glasprojoe: @adamhousley Can we get the info before the Alumni game?
That actually wasn’t meant to be a tease. It was meant to be a text...but since we...the few of us left in the media who just want truth and could care less and about politics...are doing what we can to clean government up. There is a ton of unrest tonight.
I have some info
@BretBaier did a fantastic and fair job interviewing Devin Nunes. A ton of headlines coming out of his interview. Would love to see an hourlong with Nunes and Schiff. Going back and forth...so we could truly and finalize the facts. @specialreport
Wow...Devin Nunes on Fox just insinuated that on two occasions former director of the FBI James Comey lied, or didn’t tell the committee the whole story
nobody is mentioning this https://t.co/R42ftm9btS
Remember that last year the FISA court last year said it has seen a pattern of bad faith requests. Was the court referring to this?
I have been saying this started waaaaay before Trump. This isn't about Trump, this is about power. Too many agents say the same. https://t.co/siCXygXBAl
Does this revelation change, or question, the investigation into @GenFlynn and what he has admitted to doing. With the sentencing postponed, what does that mean? Was it postponed due to this memo and the IG investigation?
No kidding....Now just need a Friday that begins a vacation! https://t.co/sdgE09pNm3
As a journalist....I want any and all info. Still can't understand why any journalist would not want a memo released..from either party. Transparency...that's what we are supposed to want.
We know this...the memo is being spun by both sides...but the argument that this somehow endangers national security is clearly not the case.
Again...this is clearly a power thing...politics is involved, but it isn't just that simple.
It looks as if both candidates were searching for dirt in each other. BOTH should be investigated and hopefully Mueller is doing that. I mean a foreign spy giving a phony dossier to the FBI and they used it to open an investigation and obtain a FISA warrant is concerning
My feed is great right now. My liberal friends are saying this memo is a dud and my republican friends say it's a bombshell. Glad nothing has changed.
So what needs to be clearly determined...was the FISA Court lied to...and members of the FBI knowingly did so. In your mind does the memo show this?
Agents are reacting to the memo release...as one says "I have used information from questionable sources before, but I always corroborated it before I went in front of a judge. Always"
This memo shows...the problem is not the agency...not our system...but a few people within the system.
McCabe....says no surveillance warrant would have been sought without the dossier. This and a number of other actions by McCabe have been questioned by many agents within his own agency.
Get first person accounts. Get first person accounts....and repeat.
Serious questions about credible sourcing by some of my colleagues in the media. We see circular reporting and this...this..along with politics...needs to be called out. Opinion is one thing, news is another. The lines have been more than blurred.
The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials, but excluded from the FISA applications.
Agents...respected high level agents...have said that there have been investigations shut down and other political issues they have had to deal with for years. As media..it is our job to call all of this out. Again..not about politics.
FBI agents are speaking up. They have been complaining about internal issues since before Trump. Remember the questions surround the work of a few that held power, not representative of the men and women on the ground risking their lives and protecting ours every day.
Where the Republicans are wrong is assuming this is an issue that just began. The issues in our agencies...and it's not the massive majority of agents who do damn good work...has been building since well before Trump
According to the memo, the disputed dossier was used by the FBI to obtain a warrant to spy on members of the Trump team, also the FISA court was never told the dossier was political opposition research, according to the House Intelligence Committee memo
A father....If life were fair...he'd get his 1 minute with Nassar. https://t.co/Jn0DQtWMpo
We...as the people...have given up too much power. We focus on party politics, we should be focused on what’s right and what is wrong and the fact that we have lost significant power to government. #weareone
What’s sad is that serious questions and clear contradictions are being swept under the rug..or attempted to...in the name of politics. I could care less who it politically helps or hurts, I care that as Americans we deserve better.
So reports were that Wray couldn't find anything wrong with the memo....and now the FBI releases a statement and reports are he says there are problems. As usual...more of the same. Which is it?
This is true...and we've seen significant omissions already...like text messages..e-mails. https://t.co/Jau6s6095m
Maybe that...considering baseball's place in our history...could have helped change society earlier for all.

The hardworking agents in the field have been concerned for sometime...as one said...this is the biggest open secret out there. "We always battled with the execs"
For those who think this is about Trump..for...or against....these internal issues at high levels have been ongoing well before his election
As a journalist...I just want truth. Truth. Politics has enveloped the idea, in many places erased the desire for truth. Hypocrisy abounds. As citizens, we need to put politics aside/remember government serves us. As a member of the media it is my job to be a watchdog
Thank you for your service. Let all the agents know we appreciate everything they do...and they can always talk to me....I just seek truth...follow neither party. :) https://t.co/yF2vvoTDXP

So yep....it's been 5 years. Yep #Benghazi was politicized. Not by me. Not by those who want to find truth. Learning from mistakes matters. Ensuring our men and women are covered...matters. Just a reminder for tonight.
A hearing didn't find out a team was in Croatia and another was in Spain...a Reporter did. The government didn't tell us either. Also a hearing didn't find out intimate details on the ground that night. We did...a reporter.
Just remember...a hearing...and those had issues...many I have reported....didn't find the guys who hunted down the terrorists. A reporter did. A hearing didn't find the pilots who were sitting in the planes, even when we were told there weren't any available...a reporter did
Yep...have you done something to truly find out what happened in #Benghazi. We have been told a number of lies, from agencies, elected officials, the military...timelines didn't match
Maybe the question should be....why are those of us who have only been interested in the truth...including questioning the Republicans...cause they have issues as well with #benghazi being stonewalled? FOIA's come back with entire pages blacked out. Have you done something?
I find it funny when some in the media question about why we aren't still doing stories on #benghazi. Well...we are. We have been...and we will be. Khattala was never considered a mastermind by anyone there and almost every single source...more than 30 now..questioned his trial
Prayers are with @Steelers LB Ryan Shazier.
Aaaaaaah great day to taste. Well arent all days? RT @Centuryoakwine: Tasting room is still pouring for another 1:15!! #lodiwine #winetasting

@LadyOnTheRight1 DM to start...then expand. Facebook also.
I also know a few of your guys and have a bunch more of my own. Men..and women. All are solid people with impeccable credibility...unlike the investigations and the politics that has kept many truths from emerging. We haven't learned much actually. https://t.co/X9SUeVtZXT
FBI was more than tardy in investigating this case. In their defense they were held back. Our Special Forces were on the front end and were ignored. Twice. November 2012 and January 2013. Nobody..in either party has explained why.  #Benghazi https://t.co/X9SUeVtZXT
REMEMBER prior to his arrest, Khattalah was easily found walking the streets in Benghazi and sitting at cafe’s and spoke with the media.
This U.S. #Benghazi ’Target List' was broken down into 4 groups of individuals: Ansar al Sharia, Al Qaeda which contains 4 suspects, Al Qaeda in Iraq and the final group is listed as “Libyan Militants."
Not a pat on the back, a reminder that this stuff has been out there. I reported that initial info on 10 suspects identified within days of the #benghazi attack and eventually grew to more than 20…Khatallah was at or near the bottom.
Also reported the guys who hunted the #Benghazi terrorists "Khattala's capture was an easy one, he was low hanging fruit” and another insisted that senior leaders at the State Department and military had significant visual and audio intelligence on at least 20 other suspects
In 2014 I reported on #benghazi "Despite the Obama Admin’s insistence that Khattala is mastermind of Benghazi terrorist attack, multiple State Dep &amp; Mil sources tell me more senior suspects are not only getting away with murder, but training others to attack U.S. and our allies
As I reported multiple times about Abu Khattala..the men and women on the ground in #benghazi considered him low hanging fruit and he was NOT the mastermind
@wynglasscharms you are missing the point. U aren’t the one I am talking about...and thanks
No kidding...now if we can just wake up a few others to this fact RT @Sy_Ali: @adamhousley @TFinn82 @AdelineParker20 #progress Welcome to 2017!

@TFinn82 @AdelineParker20 very cool to see. Would love to meet him at some point.
Yep very true. RT @TFinn82: She's American, mixed race, divorced and Catholic. All of which used to be a big issue for royals. @adamhousley @AdelineParker20

Agreed RT @ananavarro: What the hell’s wrong w/all these men? What happened to romance, the art of seduction? Sexual harassment is a pathetic power play,  plain wrong and a lazy man’s answer to getting a girl. Real men know how to attract a woman, NOT attack a woman.

@Princess_0409 yep...and most, of not all men...know the line.
@Princess_0409 most men don’t grope or cross that line. They may have stupid pick up lines and other dumb stuff, but we know putting our hands on a women unwanted....is.....not accepted. Unless they are 13.
@JOEMAMA526 and probably were the kids in school who weren’t popular and when they got power as an adult decided....hey...You must respect me now
Not all women have and some men have. I️ know this. RT @TriciaEdwards2: @adamhousley @Seekandfind And I have been lambasted today because I said I HADN'T been harassed nor assaulted! Oh, the humanity!
@Maryell04466305 men don’t need to learn unless we are 13-15 yrs old and at that point we are not men...but being taught common decency by our parents/grandparents. Anyone...regardless of party or power position...who is an adult and not mentally ill...knows the line.
For the record...the massive majority of men know the line not to cross when it comes to women....AND.....we condemn the jackwads who do cross the line.

@TNJed3 @Bwdreyer wrong suspect.
Thank God for Honest Abe.
@JasonHornbuckle @JacobAWohl I didn’t bring morality into the argument. He won. No matter who helped.
@JasonHornbuckle @JacobAWohl nope. WASHINGTON won
@RebelSmith626 @JacobAWohl good points
@the_Impolitic @JacobAWohl very good point. There were so many variables.
@AusRichie @JacobAWohl then win and write it. He didn’t. The south didn’t. We remain as one now, even a bit fractured..we are one
I’m ready. Only need about 8 in the pen RT @kirk_bridgers: @adamhousley You pitching tomorrow? D's need help. 2 many dingers
So much more on #Benghazi and what BOTH parties have done are not done to truly find out what happened and make changes
@JacobAWohl Nope. A loss is a loss is a loss. He lost and he fought against his own country.
Well....wow...New York legislator has epic meltdown over a speeding ticket https://t.co/inkhrI32aN via @nypost
@JacobAWohl But he fought against our country. Amazing as he was....he still traded sides and that should not be forgotten. Oh...and he lost.
And don't forget...Libya is a mess
Just reminding everyone of what we reported on #Benghazi ... there were at least 20 terrorists on the target list
#Benghazi Target List’ was broken down into 4 groups of terrorists. 1.Ansar al Sharia  2.Al Qaeda 3.Al Qaeda in Iraq 4.Libyan Militants
I am told we had a target list made by U.S. special forces on the ground in #benghazi after the attack
Remember...timelines didn't match AND The Admin lied to us. The State Dep lied to us. Investigations were lacking at best &amp; political
Thank you for your service RT @MarkGeistSWP: @adamhousley From one who was there your reporting was fair and accurate
US had actionable intelligence at end of 2012 on #Benghazi terrorists. The team was asked again in January. Both times nothing was done
The list eventually grew to more than 20 as American Special Forces conducted surveillance in and around #Benghazi
the United States had a ’Target List' that initially contained about 10 suspects identified within days of the attack #Benghazi
Not patting myself or my colleagues on the back...just a reminder you didn't see any of this anywhere else..at least nothing of note
Also reported “we could have picked him up months and months ago and there was no change, or urgency to do this now.”  #Benghazi
In April &amp; May of 2013 I reported: capture of Ahmed Abu Khatalla  was an easy one. “He was low hanging fruit” says my source #Benghazi
Back to #benghazi and my colleagues in the media and others who insinuated our/my reporting was somehow political. Yep..another detail
@InfoSomniac2 you are 1000% correct
And honesty from the military and 3 letter agencies RT @Thefuriousone1: @adamhousley We need closure on this matter #benghazi
We need honesty from BOTH parties on this matter RT @Thefuriousone1: @adamhousley We need closure on this matter.
Mustafa al-Imam isn’t the only main terrorist who hit us in #benghazi...there are still others
They have also said the guy we currently hold is “low hanging fruit” this was planned and it has to do with what we were doing in #benghazi
From my original reporting the men and women on the ground in #benghazi have said the mastermind is still out there

@smcosta1969 it was on Kaui in 1989 and Arnie was with him
I know...kinda odd RT @RonRigdon: @adamhousley That's surreal dude...
Weird this is still captivating many.....so many years later
I met OJ when I was a kid in Hawaii...he was filming a Hertz commercial. Ron Goldman waited on me in college at Pier View in Malibu.
Shep and Jim Gray point out the brutal death of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman
OJ said nobody has ever accused him of pulling a weapon on anyone...really? I wonder if the parole board will consider this #OJSimpson
Leave it to @GeraldoRivera to give this hearing a perspective.
Please tell me Saturday Night Live is going to parody this....this is a 2-0 85 mph fastball to Arenado at Coors with the wind blowing out
OJ says he's done his time and honored the verdict for 9 years and was respectful in prison. Just wants to get back and see his kids
Back in 1995 on this day Bill Clinton was Pres.  Waterfalls by TLC was big. Clueless on the big screen. Seinfeld, Friends on TV
This is the ultimate #tbt with #ojsimpsonparole now live on every major network and streaming all over online
Reminder: we broke the story when OJ violated his bail and his bail bondsmen flew to Florida to bring him back to Vegas
OJ asked to explain why he went into hotel with 2 armed men. He is explaining his story now. #ojsimpsonparole
OJ laughs when parole board slips up and says he is 90 years old...rather than 70. Says "I feel like it" #ojsimpsonparole

The hearing clearly got away from collusion topic as well.
Senator Feinstein with an interesting and clearly bipartisan take when she alluded to constitutional rights
Manchin and Sessions had a good and fair back and forth
@TinPotDickTator Thanks for the info. People on my feed are arguing both sides on this.
Sessions continues to spar in Senate cross over private conversations with the President not yet revealed.
As a reporter I just think Sessions and his answers should be held to the same standard as Lynch,Holder,Ashcroft,etc. not sure happening
@thor_benson LOL #typosmatter
The real contention so far...is whether Sessions can testify about private conversations w/President. Lawyers..is that Atty/Client priv?
@thor_benson Are your response from a left wing political hack who likely has overseas experience at a Sandals resort.
Sen Heinrich and Sessions getting touchy. Heinrich cites McCabe...an Administration adversary within the FBI we are told.
Sessions is getting ticked...now at the secret innuendo and suggestions that he hasn't been honest
Sessions fires back ay Wyden...saying "I am not stonewalling"
DiFi and Sessions interaction the best so far.
Watching reporters on my feed spin this in their direction is amazing. Almost more interesting than the hearing.
Warner presses Sessions about Russian Ambassador. It's becoming a case of how many times can you say no &amp; in how many different ways
I know.....leave the kid alone https://t.co/LEDjvSJ1ns
There are a ton of news reports that are being outed as wrong between Comey and now Sessions.
@Science_Reigns And yet no evidence
Sessions clearly and defiantly defends his honor in opening statement
Sessions says he will recuse himself into any investigation into the campaign for President...but has dedicated himself to highest standards
Sessions strongly defends his reputation and any connection with Russian collusion. Our sources still say at this point no evidence at all
Grandstanding in 3....2.....1   #SessionsHearing
Sessions sworn in
The partisanship has already begun and we are still in the statements
Sessions takes seat and hearing is ready to begin. #SessionsHearing

Yes...the dates for Comey to leak and the Pres tweet could also be an issue. They clearly don't match.
What todays testimony clearly showed..and we can all agree..Washington and its perceptions are as divided as America is
This kid is fantastic https://t.co/47a5feOQie
The Justice Department issued a statement rebuking James Comey's testimony https://t.co/0JKc3CUPsS
My FBI feedback. Not all agents current and former go this far, but while some don't support President, all felt Comey made mistakes https://t.co/0sNeRLZSGK
@keencolo thanks for noticing them! 😀
In a legal sense..no bombshell, but Comey called President a liar and reminded everyone that the Pres ordered everyone out of Oval office.
Questions now for Trump. Can he govern amidst all of this? Also...will it ever be proven if he asked loyalty or not?
Comey also testified before he wasn't a leaker and then today he was. That could prove interesting as well.
Also interesting to note the different ways Comey handled Trump and Lynch and the conversations he had with them about investigations
Unreal how both sides are spinning this. Watching my feed right now is like watching two completely different worlds
Well the hearing wasn't interesting. Nor the reaction from the right and the left.
@MLevineReports @szeyian @janawinter Not sure he is allowed to do that tho
Comey says the Russian involvement in campaign was very serious. Also both President Trump and Clinton are involved in the investigation
McCain sparring with Comey right now
https://t.co/i6gac7mVof
As I have been reporting...the memo situation is a big one https://t.co/gp4BWeZQtm
Sen @JohnCornyn asks #Comey if an FBI agent feels a crime has been committed do they have a duty to report it?
Comey says firing him has done nothing to hinder the Russia investigation
Comey says it doesn't make sense to him that firing an FBI Director would make the Russia Investigation to go away
Has a robber with a gun ever used the word "hope"? Could be a new line here in tinseltown for the latest bad guy
Senator Harris asks a series of questions that Comey won't answer due to classification...her line of questions insinuates collusion
@RealDeanCain I know...wow
Comey says it would not be abnormal for an incoming National Security Advisor t have conversations with a foreign ambassador
You know...all of us seagulls at the beach are watching the Presidents Twitter account closer than our 401K's
But it was written as a serving FBI Director...again...this could end up being an issue https://t.co/UiayLxobqn
Comey says he is unsure whether HRC would have fired him if she had been elected.
Wow.....Lankford: Can you just get the documents back from your friend and then give them to us? Comey: "Potentially."
Comey says Lynch asking to call the investigation "a matter" concerned him
So Comey leaked his memos to the media, but did not provide a copies to Congress investigating
Comey says he gave his source the memo to leak, not verbally. Again..big detail. Senator Lankford asks for a copy since they don[t have it
@BretBaier @DaveWallaceUS Assuming the source would have leaked it correctly
Comey said Trump said he "hoped" Comey could "let this go." The obstruction case could hinge on "hope" and the firing.
Comey just admitted he leaked part of his memo. That is beyond interesting.
Comey says he asked friend to share part of his memo w/the press. Again..the memo, which has classification questions, could be an issue
Rubio...who took a beating from Trump during the election...may have done him best during this hearing
I think the back and forth will continue...not sure if there will be any bombshells.
Wyden clearly shifts the argument away from collusion to abuse of power/obstruction
Ouch https://t.co/GW1EgzAmiX
FEINSTEIN: Why didn't you stop the convo w/ POTUS? COMEY: "Maybe if I were stronger I would have. I was so stunned."
@arranandersen I know....this is all over the pace...as was the explanation
Comey says he agreed with the President that Flynn was a good guy. Hmmmm. Interesting detail.
So far..Comey wasn't pressured..Trump not under investigation..Russians were hacking..Comey thinks the President is a liar..Clinton/Lynch
Comey says he doesn't know for sure why he was fired. He just has to go from press accounts
Unless an anonymous source cites it :) https://t.co/xer017a8KP
The Lynch/Clinton detail is the biggest surprise so far..along with the possible obstruct of justice direction
Comey says all his aides agreed there was no investigation of President @realDonaldTrump himself and he told Trump that when they met
#Comey says he decided to write down notes in an unclassified manner. I am told that may give him...Comey...some trouble
This is clear....Comey and Trump are not going to have dinner again.
Comey confirms that he never took notes after meetings with Bush or Obama, but did every time he met with Trump. #ComeyDay
Remember Loretta Lynch said she and Bill Clinton's tarmac meeting was about the grandkids and golf
Interesting. Was this written down in a detailed way? https://t.co/7Dd6nD0OKh
There could be a ton of obstruction of justice investigations in the last 25 years.
Comey says he was never given direct access or content to the devices that were claimed to be hacked by the DNC #ComeyDay
Interesting https://t.co/QiUC2w3NCv
Interesting to see my feed and the different takes by my liberal and conservative friends. Also by my media colleagues.
Comey says President Trump did not ask him to stop the Russian Investigation #ComeyDay
Comey says he is confident no votes were altered by hacking during the 2016 election. #ComeyDay
There were absolutely agents in the FBI who were upset with the way Comey conducted himself during the election.
Reminder....Comey was fired while visiting the FBI office here in LA.
Comey sworn in and is officially under oath. #ComeyDay
We know what the Russians did. They..along with the N Koreans, Chinese, Israeli's and others all tried and hacked us. They've been doing it
As a reporter...we must call out the continued hypocrisy in Washington within BOTH parties.
Warner then says the way Comey was fired "was ultimately shocking"...didn't Senators in BOTH parties call for his firing?
Senator Warner says the hearing is not about Republicans versus Democrats and says Russians tried to cause chaos amongst American voters
Burr's opening statement asks about alleged Russian collusion and also about the Clinton E-mail Investigation  #ComeyDay
Aaaaaaaaand it has begun
Interesting...so many stories from unnamed sources about Comey...many were wrong.
Aaaaaand that's why they are so tough. Cleveland plays a damn good game and still can't win it. Lebron doesn't have the bench GS has
Lebrun just ran over Steph
Some brutal calls right now
That no call on Draymond was a complete joke. @warriors #nbafinals
NSA Director Rogers says he has never been directed to do anything inappropriate
Also...the 702 has some serious questions that as journalists, those of us left, need to push. It can be kept with changes to close holes

My IC sources are irate right now. They say intent is never an excuse and that is made massively clear. Hmmmmm
Hearing is over. Nearly 4 hours long. This is normally a routine oversight hearing. Curious to see how some answers end up playing out
Comey says more U.S. citizens are under investigation for terrorism than non citizens
Comey won't answer Russia connection questions by committee and seems to be comfortable with Deputy AG
@wmbo @kuhn_josiah thanks. None of this is easy right now. In both investigations. Unmasking and also Russia.
@wmbo @kuhn_josiah it will be seen
@wmbo @kuhn_josiah it wasn't just "foreign spies" and that is the concern here
@kuhn_josiah @wmbo besides immense connections within IC, 2 stints at Hoover, MA from U of A and reporting from 20 countries some w/IC
Comey is responding to Senator Whitehouse
Comey says 12 classified e-mails were forwarded and it is hard to determine whether that exploited national security
Comey questioned about 2 day interval/delay between Flynn's meeting
@mmeyerdc and that metadata can be searched and possibly used Einstein
@kuhn_josiah keep up your concern
@RBHamerica @CoolhwipPoker @20committee you're right. Hard to compete with a sexton/cheater. I'm done with you guys. Lol
That...that...is what needs to be known. We do know congress was incidentally collected during the Iran deal debate.
Comey also responds to Senator Lee by saying "what matters is how we keep and use that data"
Wow...Comey just admits that 702's get incidental collection and those communications involving Americans can be searched w/o a warrant
Comey agrees to question: 702 doesn't target people abroad like a diplomat unless it is an issue of national security.
Will do RT @LauraL2126: @adamhousley Keep being you, Adam!! 👌🏻
@RyanOtey @20committee oh...that's NOT what we were looking at. Russia investigation is going too. Don't jump to conclusions being fed
@smmarrujo thanks. Have a good flight
@RyanOtey @20committee I am too. I am country over party every damn day
Grassley hammering Comey now
Maybe you and those on the other side should put partisanship aside and truly and try to find the truth and put politics aside
Welcome to the trolls. Keep following. You'll see the truth. We are not investigating for Trump, or the Dems...it's about truth
Comey says he is made of stone when Grassley suggests a break
@JenWoodruff79 @Nole4life02 @20committee wow. Moving on now. Integrity is clear.
lol so I hear RT @Nole4life02: @adamhousley @20committee Someone loves exposing things
@awhite_hispanic @20committee seriously...I had no idea. Lol. What a tool...or lack@of a working one.
@RyanOtey @20committee wow...ok...I admit. Trump calls me every morning with marching orders. Man you guys are losing it
@mksystem74 @20committee or you and spelling.
@RyanOtey @20committee dude you really are an IC guy. You were in the voting booth with me. Oh wait..I voted absentee!
@NuveRed @20committee hope you enjoyed little league...oh and the fine accommodations in your moms basement
@alshuey @20committee nope. Our rights are being threatened from BOTH sides of the aisle
@MollyTov_CkTail @20committee not a Trumpster. Good try tho.
@RyanOtey @20committee but that would assume you and the other trolls know how to read a fairly process.
@RyanOtey @20committee maybe you should read or watch my reports. We broke Unmasking. And both Dems &amp; Repubs were responsible #benghazi
Lol. He's clearly got a horse RT @AndrewJAsh: @adamhousley @20committee Dammmmnnn!  Adam owned that other guy that nobody knows...
Doesn't the Attorney General decided intent and the FBI provide the investigative details?
@20committee And I have more facts than you can imagine or know...washed up former intelligence guy who now is a political operative. #beatit
@20committee Opinions are everything clearly. Facts say otherwise. Have a good day.
Our intelligence sources say they have "the rules beaten into them" and that if they had done this they would have been prosecuted 4 same
Comey says he couldn't prove criminal intent of Abedin forwarding classified e-mails to Weiner for HRC
Comey says they have not yet interviewed Weiner. He says Abedin forwarded emails to him to print, but he doesn't think he read them
@20committee I have zero to hide...but I worry for our country and the way this has and can be misused
Also...we know the North Koreans, Chinese, Israeli's, British and many groups not associated directly with governments have been doing it
For clarification: The Russians have been trying to hack our elections and many others for years. We have been doing the same.
Comey uses a terrorist e-mail as incidental collection example. We known they were monitoring much more than just terrorists
How can we trust that the intelligence agencies and politicians are following the law and not using their positions for political purposes?
My question...how are we as Americans supposed to know when 702's and other classified operations are no longer legal?
Comey says the obligation rests on people in government, not legitimate news gathering.
Comey says they have found no evidence that Russians changed any vote tallies
Comey says the Russians are doing it all over the world. Our sources say we are as well.
Comey says Russian government still involved in American politics
Senator Graham is grilling Comey on unmasking
Comey says there has been no misuse of 702...but Congress already had hearings about being picked up and that would equate misuse
702 has been around for almost 10 years...serious questions should be asked whether it is lawful and whether it has or can be misused
As journalists and as Americans, we should all care and understand the 702 process and whether it should be renewed
Comey says knowing what he knows now, he would still make the same decision
Comey says the FBI found classified emails forwarded from Hillary Clinton's email by Huma Abedin to Anthony Weiner
@SimplyAJ10 @mookiebetts @RedSox @MLB as Americans and baseball fans...that thought will never be tolerated again. Millions have ur 6
The idiocy continues. Some guy cuts old women with a cane off in line, has words with her, blames her cart for "ramming him" wtf

@mikesreid @ChehaiberJay @FoxNews @MaliaMZimmerman looking at that too
@bleiby527 it's called investigating and reporting fact. Which we have done. So many others don't.
@jeffraykovich thank you
@bleiby527 you're wrong...sorry. Do some research and avoid the Kool Aid
@MikaelaSkyeSays there may be multiple stories here. We are looking at both...I can assure you that
@MikaelaSkyeSays ours are...read em all and you will get an accurate and fair account of what we know so far
@MikaelaSkyeSays  not true
This is clear....#Lavrov and #Tillerson did not budge. Either of them.
Always problems in world. Right now: Syria,Korea,Libya,South Sudan,South Africa,Venezuela,Afghanistan,Iraq,Yemen,South China Sea. A few.
#Lavrov complains about Libya and the overthrow of Gaddafi. Now South Sudan. Clearly hammering recent U.S. foreign policy/decisions
Curious what leaders in both parties feel about Tillerson's performance right now. These meetings in Russia/press conference is defining
This Press Conference is fascinating. Watching two men holding their ground and it is clear the tension that exists. https://t.co/XMJkCGAdqb
#Lavrov just complained about U.S. rhetoric....Tillerson should answer a question with a question.

@burghseyeview any time!
Rice's interview also seems to contradict what Clapper said.
So which is it...It was a clear and fair question Mitchell should have asked. Two weeks ago you said you knew nothing and then today...
Rice: "In order to understand the importance of the report...it was necessary to request, the information as to who that U.S. official was"
So on PBS at end of March Rice said she didn't know what Chairman Nunes was walking about, but today with Mitchell she said it was normal
@Onanseedspiller Yeah...that's not true.
The pictures and video coming in from Syria right now is truly heartbreaking
We have reported no classified intel....
https://t.co/Tc6rlSFiRq
@Anthony Agreed.
For the record, seeking truth is not creating a diversion. Arguing such is taking a political position. We can investigate more than 1 story
Solid work by @MaliaMZimmerman as we continue to report this story. More coming. It's just about finding truth. That's it.
@fliesc1 @Cernovich did u even see our reporting on Friday. We sat on nothing. Can't speak for others.
@PhinsnNoles playing with words. In this case it was unprecedented
The information was disseminated to everyone at the top. More reports coming throughout the day on @FoxNews
@Hublife @TXKY22 @EliLake @BV The idea is to get it right...not first. Kudos to their coverage. We continue our investigation.
@Hublife @TXKY22 @EliLake @BV Cernovich and Lake absolutely reported Rice..no question. @MaliaMZimmerman and I started this last week and the idea here is to find truth
@TXKY22 @EliLake @BV He was the first to say Rice...We started this coverage last week.

@justinjm1 And when I report a story about Repubs...Dems will do the same. Can't control either side and their spin..I can control finding truth
I know...and it still doesn't help me RT @AusRichie: @adamhousley just remember Affect is always a verb.  Effect is mostly a noun.
@JayCaruso @20committee When it involves national security. Rare when it involves Americans not connected.
@20committee Part of my MA &amp; studied at Hoover. Have many in the industry. So no expert...but knowledge. You seem fair....Just kidding.
Thank you https://t.co/Rk3FGQItgT
Unmasking of Americans is a big issue. Big issue. Collusion would be also. We have multiple issues to look into.
Also for the record...Affect and Effect....that ALWAYS gets me. So I just use synonyms :)
Follow Friday...first time in a while @MaliaMZimmerman @SawickiFNC @WillCarrFNC
So yep...I know the difference between their and there...I also know the difference between truth and politics. Our report = truth
For the record....if you wade through my 21,500+ tweets...you may find a typo. If you have that time...find a damn job
@KeithOlbermann So a phone typo/spellcheck discredits my report? What about all the wondrous reasons you've left your previous jobs? That discredit you?
@robertcaruso Bingo....I am speaking to Russian propaganda artists...damn you are good. I am outed and I love vodka. lol
@20committee Weren't mine.
@11SBiase Their could be evidence...if so, it is classified and I am not allowed to see it. Tho my sources have yet to see anything significant
Yep everything is political. You guys can politicize either way all you want, we are just going to keep reporting truth @MaliaMZimmerman
We are going to do ours
I carry the ball for myself and my team of news producers/reporters dedicated to news. Opinion folks can do their thing
We are digging into both. We found this unmasking as part of our investigation. Politics aside...it should concern every American
The idea isn't to defend Trump...or Attack Trump. The idea is to find the truth about this and any foreign interference into our elections
We seek the truth. Our intelligence agents are frustrated and battling internally...how serious...depends on the agency
Our full write-up on our breaking investigation into unmasking https://t.co/gy9CbTK2PN
Also...I am told that House and Senate intelligence chairmen have regularly gone to White House offices 2 see raw intelligence in the past
@justinjm1 Also...been in this job a loooong time. Thanks for the advice.
@justinjm1 It is my reporting and it is my sources...soooo....the assumption is that they have a directive. I reported truth. Anything is political
@glasprojoe It's classified and I don't have classified clearance to know.
Great work by @johnrobertsFox at the White House press conference today with Spicer. Pushing the questions about unmasking
The point...is to find truth. Could care less about politics or party.
@MaliaMZimmerman has been working her sources as well....together they matched for this story today. She is our .com investigative reporter
Absolutely https://t.co/ReAqcOnhMl
@justinjm1 Counteroffensive? I have no horse in this game and neither do my sources. It's called finding truth. More should try it
I will also note...my sources are "not Trump people" They are "just frustrated with the politicalization of our intelligence agencies"
Our sources: "It had everything to do with hurting and embarrassing Trump and his team"
Our sources: Unmasking the names and then spreading the names was for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security
Our sources:The person who did the unmasking is "very well known, very high up, very senior, in the intelligence world &amp; is not in the FBI
Our sources: This surveillance that led to the unmasking of private names of American citizens started before Trump was the GOP nominee.
To unmask a name is rare....never for politics
Congressional investigators know the name of at least one person who was unmasking names...and they know who
