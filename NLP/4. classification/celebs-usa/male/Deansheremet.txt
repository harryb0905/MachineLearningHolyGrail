@hels I think you missed the point. He is highlighting the disparity between the coast to the other regions using comedy. But the fact is he was telling Amazon to help revive somewhere that got left behind.

@ThePerezHilton So I think picking together is cool in that scenario.
@ThePerezHilton How does it work with same sex couples? 1 ring, 2 rings? Who proposes?
@ThePerezHilton If it was terrible than I would think you could swap it, but if you did you’re homework she/he should be happy and honored you took the time and love it
@Elex_Michaelson I hope you are right!?!?
@ThePerezHilton You get a feel for what they like. Cut, vibe setting then you do your job. Picking it with them would be weird and kill the surprise. Clearly I have way too much experience at this 🤦🏻‍♂️

So it’s ok for a sitting president to skip multiple armed forces related events, especially Arlington cemetery on Veterans Day but kneeling during the anthem is the greatest disrespect to the military? Asking for a nation.
@USATODAY It’s irresponsible to write headlines like this and not provide context. Most people don’t ever click to the full article.

@Stop_Trump20 @JudiLembke This has to be the @TheOnion
@facilities83 @DLoesch You are right. I strongly disagree with her POV, and it was out of line with the educated discourse I encourage
@facilities83 @DLoesch Because it was inarticulate of what I really meant.
@Wrongsideofpar @Jay_Corwin True that.
@Jay_Corwin @Wrongsideofpar You are right. The language was reactionary. Hence why I deleted it.
@Wrongsideofpar I deleted the tweet because it was inarticulate of my greater point. More guns isn’t the answer.
@steveo386 @DLoesch I’ll agree with you there. It’s out of control.
@Gun_it_Mike @DLoesch It’s the constant more guns = more safety. We have more guns than anyone, yet why aren’t we the safest country. Call me all the names you wish. I grew up with guns and have a military family. I don’t hate guns.

@applecharlie5 @mayorhopper @oliverdarcy Not really
@Tea4gunsSC @oliverdarcy Never said that did I?
@applecharlie5 @mayorhopper @oliverdarcy You miss my point. Not arguing free speech. Was highlighting that when he doesn’t like someone for whatever reason he comes after them

@SamSifton Yes please!
@CrossFitGames I’m more @MichaelPhelps style. With the butterfly arms. Longer pull
@MatthewACherry @atrupar Sensing a theme here.
Hot button question: whose job should it be to secure the border? Some government organization has to do it. Does ICE jest need better training?

@rolandscahill 1. I think you meant “Russian operative” 2. Not sure if you know how conviction works, he’s currently on trial so that comes before Conviction. I know you would love nothing more than to live in a guilty before proven innocent dictatorship, but real PATRIOTS feel otherwise

@MollyJongFast Duh what else do you need such an expensive karaoke setup for?
@KONRADKASPAREK @summerbrennan @dhmeyer So unfortunate. I don’t want this to get petty so I’ll say this, I FEEL YOU. We are fighting on the same side. A living wage in this country is harder by the day. Employers and managers need to step up their game and respect employees. There’s a reason for the high turnover
@KONRADKASPAREK @summerbrennan @dhmeyer “As I say” do you not believe me? Ha. I suppose it depends on the owner but I think you’re wrong. The standard needs to be lifted
@summerbrennan That’s a super bizarre take/solution

@jgfleet661 @adamcbest I surely wasn’t born rich. I came from a military family. I’ve worked my ass off for everything I have. My point is there are clear perks afforded to white males in America.

@Minxi501 @SInow @KingJames Totally hear you. We all grew up playing Jordan on the street. LeBron has so much more in the tank. It shall be interesting to watch
@BrycenNFL As we are both Pats fans I’ll be civil. Clearly there is a reason he is squatting like this. He didn’t get to where he is doing things unintentional. I definitely don’t squat like that but as soon as anyone who never played professional anything love to come out and hate
@Minxi501 @SInow @KingJames I remember the Detroit BadBoys my friend. Jordan was the best until @KingJames come along. No other player can takeover a game like him. (Cue your ring argument next I’m sure)
