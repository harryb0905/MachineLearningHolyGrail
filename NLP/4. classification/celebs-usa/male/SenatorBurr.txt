On an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 92-8, the Senate votes to #SaveLWCF. My full statement here: https://t.co/DVVFU1SxiE https://t.co/LrxGwqSAff
#LWCF is a program that matters. It makes a difference. And it operates at NO COST to taxpayers. Voting to protect it is the right thing to do. 4/4
I want to thank my colleagues, @SenCoryGardner, @SteveDaines, @SenatorCantwell, @SenatorBennet and many others, who helped lead the charge to #SaveLWCF and to preserve America’s amazing natural treasures. 3/4
Today’s vote has been a long time in the making. We knew three years ago that #LWCF (founded in 1965) would expire in Sept. 2018, but despite strong bipartisan support, Congress was slow to act. I am glad we’re finally fixing that. 2/4
Big News: The Senate is about to vote to #SaveLWCF, America’s most successful conservation program, as part of the #LandsPackage2019. Today’s vote will provide the certainty necessary for #LWCF to carry out important long-term efforts. 1/4
Walter will be remembered as a man of strong principles, willing to take an unpopular stand when necessary. He was a hard-working and faithful public servant, and he will be sorely missed. Our prayers are with his family – may he rest in peace. 2/2
@RepWalterJones and I came to Washington together in 1995. Having worked alongside him for nearly 25 years, I can tell you without hesitation that he left North Carolina, Congress, and our country better places than he found them. 1/2
Saddened to hear of the passing of my friend and former colleague @JohnDingell. John was a true legend in the House, and anyone who worked with him learned a great deal in the process.
Thank you @SecElaineChao &amp; @USDOTFRA Administrator Batory for this needed investment in NC’s and America’s infrastructure. These improvements mark the next step toward high-speed rail between Raleigh and Richmond, helping bring our transportation system into the 21st century. 2/2
.@USDOTFRA announced a crucial $10 million grant to @NCDOT yesterday, providing several needed railway upgrades, highway improvements, and traffic alleviation near Raleigh, NC. 1/2

Senate Intel’s #WorldwideThreats hearing is an important opportunity for the American people to hear what the intel community is doing to meet the global threats facing our nation. Watch live @ 9:30am ET: https://t.co/plW1fe44j6
3/These indictments should send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate pernicious and illegitimate behavior that threatens our economic and national security.
2/Huawei is a global bad actor operating at the behest of the Chinese government and intelligence services. It seeks to undermine legitimate competition, while subverting laws and democratic institutions.
1/I am encouraged by @TheJusticeDept actions against Huawei, which detail the company’s brazen efforts to steal corporate trade secrets, commit fraud, and obstruct justice.
Reminder ➡️ Tomorrow @ 9:30am, Senate Intel will hear from @ODNIGov Dan Coats, @FBI Dir. Christopher Wray, @CIA Dir. Gina Haspel and others. Stream it live here: https://t.co/plW1fe44j6 #WorldwideThreats

2/While @USTreasury has made great strides, this deal will require constant monitoring to ensure that neither Mr. Deripaska nor the Russian gov't violate the terms. Full statement here: https://t.co/bJdm7DBBai
1/Today’s @USTreasury announcement, which comes as a result of negotiated changes to the En+ corporate structure, does not change the fact that Mr. Deripaska and his companies work at Vladimir Putin’s behest &amp; operate as de facto representatives of the Russian government.

For those who need help, visit https://t.co/eAoVZ7nbro for more info. https://t.co/glR98CnWpE
Operating at no cost to the taxpayer, #LWCF is by far our most successful conservation program. Not just because it preserves our beautiful outdoors for the next generation, but because it helps protect our communities today. #SaveLWCF
After #HurricaneSandy, wetlands like the LWCF-funded Cape May National Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey saved an estimated $650 million in damages. #LWCF funds create beautiful spaces that double as critical infrastructure. #SaveLWCF
For instance, the natural green spaces and parks that wind through Charlotte aren't just there for their looks. The Four Mile Creek Greenway also absorbs rain drainage, slowing it down and doubling as a flood control. #SaveLWCF
North Carolinians have more on their minds today than recreation, as we contend with the terrible damage inflicted by #HurricaneFlorence. But #LWCF is critical for building the infrastructure communities need to minimize floods and heavy rains. #SaveLWCF
With just 12 days left before the Land and Water Conservation Fund expires, I am as committed as ever to making sure Congress reauthorizes America's most successful conservation program. #SaveLWCF

I said I’d go down to the Senate floor every day until Congress acts to #SaveLWCF - and I’m keeping that promise. You can watch live here: https://t.co/STSngiB0eW https://t.co/eWwhx8o4rz
Here’s my promise to my colleagues: I’ll keep demanding a vote on the Senate floor - day after day - until we do what the American people want and #SaveLWCF.
#LWCF has support from Republicans and Democrats, in the Senate and in the House. Americans support the program and want it to continue. Yet for some reason, the Senate still refuses to take up this issue.
Conservation programs, like #LWCF, plan generations ahead and need security to do their work effectively. This solution provides that, while ensuring Congress is still in the driver’s seat.
This bill is a bipartisan compromise. It would permanently reauthorize #LWCF, but give Congress the chance to hold a vote of disapproval every 3 years. If the disapproval vote passes, it ends authorization.
Today, I asked the Senate to take up a bill to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund before it expires next month. #LWCF is critical for preserving our national parks and waters for future generations - and uses NO taxpayer funds. https://t.co/TLGrsLlDbc

We have a responsibility to preserve America’s beautiful landscapes so future generations can enjoy the same great outdoors we have today. Let’s work together to #SaveLWCF.
#LWCF is almost entirely funded by royalties from offshore drilling leases. That means revenue from one public resource is going to support thousands more natural resources across the country - and it costs taxpayers nothing. #SaveLWCF
#LWCF is one of our nation’s most successful conservation programs. By the numbers, #LWCF has…  ✔️ Operated for 52 years ✔️ Completed more than 42,000 recreation projects  ✔️ Helped all 50 states ✔️ Cost federal taxpayers $0
Today marks 100 days until the Land and Water Conservation Fund expires. Let’s remind my colleagues here in Congress about the important work #LWCF does to preserve and maintain our beautiful public lands and parks! #SaveLWCF

Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will testify before an open hearing of the Senate Intel Cmte tomorrow.
His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation.
Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.
In my interactions w/ the Director and w/ the Bureau under his leadership, he &amp; the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee.
His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.
I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order.
I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey’s termination.

Those of us who know Jim know he has been looking forward to his retirement for some time, and we wish him all the best.
And successfully managed the intelligence community enterprise.
Amidst evolving challenges from our adversaries, Jim has continued to reinforce our intelligence relationships with our allies.

Congress should now pass my Repay Act, which would ensure that a graduate's loan payments never exceed 15% of their income.
Student loan interest rates are cheaper, simpler &amp; more dependable now that they are no longer subject to the political whims of Congress.
This law also caps interest rates on undergrad loans, which gives students peace of mind that they are getting the best deal possible.
If you’ve taken out a student loan the last 3 years, you’ve saved money thanks to my Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act.

May God continue to bless America. #September11
We are a nation of heroes, and today we have the opportunity to stand amongst them, to thank them, and to honor those lost.
We send our thoughts and prayers to those who are currently serving in the darkest and most hostile places on the planet.
Let us today remember those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those who have since made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
It is only together that we can successfully confront and defeat vile ideologies that seek to do us harm and destroy our way of life.
Friends and allies around the world stand with us, and we must stand with them.
The evil of ISIL and al-Qaida, and related and similar groups around the world, suffers no restraints except those that we impose upon it.
I can tell you that we are up to the challenge – as long as we do not forget the past. #September11
Today is a day for remembrance, it must also be a day for refocusing: the threat to America and her allies is real and unrelenting.
For our intelligence professionals, every day must be treated like September 12, 2001, with a constant refrain: ‘Never again’
They, too, have been working around the clock since the early hours after #September11.
The intelligence professionals, military and civilian, who serve America do an incredible job.
There are others in our nation’s service who are far less visible, yet equally worthy of our praise and admiration.
These men and women, regardless of the color of the uniform they wear, are serving with honor to ensure we are secure at home.
There are countless others who have heeded the call to duty, serving at home and abroad to keep an aggressive, resourceful enemy at bay.
The 82nd Airborne, 2nd Marine Division, special operations forces, &amp; 4th Fighter Wing, are often called upon to be the first to fight.
Many of those heroes hail from towns we are so familiar with: Fayetteville, Jacksonville, Cherry Point, Goldsboro
We cannot, and will not, forget. #September11
Thousands have returned from the battlefield with grievous injuries, and so many have made the ultimate sacrifice.
Our service members and their families continue to sacrifice on behalf of all of us. #September11
Come October, they will have been at war for 15 years, taking the fight to the enemy so the enemy doesn’t bring the fight to our homes.
Our military remains engaged with the enemy in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and in other parts of the world.
In communities across our nation, first responders stand ready to put their lives on the line so that others might live.
Our first responders, continue today as they did then: rushing toward the fire and the chaos, while most rush away.
We must also remember the sacrifices made by so many others since #September11.
I ask all of you to keep those families in your thoughts and prayers today. #September11
Every #September11 reopens wounds anew for families of those lost and for the children of 9/11 who grew up without ever knowing a parent.
It has been 15 years since the horrific attacks of #September11. We remember the families across this great nation who still mourn.

#ESSA shows that the best way to achieve higher standards and better learning is through classrooms &amp; communities, not Washington DC.
Last year, we passed the Every Student Succeeds Act to #FixNCLB and give K-12 control back to local communities and classrooms.

An act of terror is just that. We must dedicate ourselves to removing intent or capability of any group who wishes to do harm to innocents.
I am reminded that terrorism is no longer differentiated by the terms "inspired", "enabled", or "directed."

This is a reasonable bill, and for many North Carolinians, lives may be at stake.
For our veterans who need health care, VA funding is not a game.
Some of my colleagues seem to think this is a game. For pregnant women, and women who hope to become pregnant, the Zika virus is not a game.
It also allocates a record level of funding for our veterans, providing every cent that the President himself asked for in his budget.
This legislation provides the funding for Zika that every Democrat Senator voted for six weeks ago.
I’m disappointed Democrats voted to block a bill to fight Zika, take care of veterans, and fund military construction projects.

Disappointed my Senate colleagues blocked a vote on the President's deal w Iran, a defining nat sec issue. They silenced America’s voice.
Sec Kerry said "we have absolute knowledge" but our intelligence is good, not perfect. It's disingenuous for Kerry to suggest otherwise.
Do we know where everything about Iran's past capabilities, future intent or ability to conceal illicit nuclear activities?
Do we know where every potential nuclear facility is located?
On the floor now. Talking #badirandeal. Our nation's security is too precious to be based on hope and faith.

This threat is real, &amp; the increasing number of attacks has a tangible impact on our economy &amp; our national security. http://t.co/62OYVgUZQH
It creates a cybersecurity info sharing environment that works much like a “neighborhood watch” program &amp; it's 100% voluntary.
The bipartisan Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 is sponsored with me by @SenFeinstein &amp; @SenJohnMcCain http://t.co/62OYVgUZQH
But it doesn’t have to be this way. There are steps we can take to help both gov't &amp; the private sector understand these attacks better.
Many estimate the financial loss &amp; theft of IP costs our economy hundreds of billions of $ every year. http://t.co/62OYVgUZQH #cybersecurity

Yesterday Sen Casey &amp; I joined our colleagues from both sides of the capital at a press conference on #ABLEact http://t.co/Zgnq7aSnYS
Yesterday I joined @BillLuMaye and discussed the Intel Report: http://t.co/Pv1VgzntnL
You can see a summary of intel gained on pages 96 and 97 of the Minority View: http://t.co/acRtW96qqD
The intelligence gained from the program helped us identify and capture important al-Qa’ida terrorists and disrupt their ongoing plotting.
Bottom line: the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program developed significant intelligence. http://t.co/acRtW96qqD
On this recent report: “The Senate's Intelligence Committee staff chose to interview no one.” http://t.co/z4FUyuU6tI
“This comm. departed from that high road &amp; slipped into the same partisan mode that marks most of what happens on Capitol Hill these days.”
“I do not have to wait to be certain our interrogation policies and procedures are aligned with our core values.” http://t.co/z4FUyuU6tI
Sen. Kerrey, who served on the Intel Committee for 8 years, wrote in USA Today abt his thoughts on the Intel report: http://t.co/z4FUyuU6tI
Former CIA Directors Tenet, Goss, and Hayden wrote a response to the Intel report released yesterday: http://t.co/kBu0KWFX6A
The Minority Views are not a minority report–the minority did not actively participate in the Study.  http://t.co/h6Gew2mcYt
It seems to me that this report only endangers our officers and allies in a blatant attempt to smear the Bush Admin. http://t.co/Ejjm8tg7GV
I urge everyone to read the Minority Views which document many falsehoods propagated by the Study: http://t.co/h6Gew2mcYt
It is regrettable that the Comm’s Dems decided to put their own political agenda before the safety &amp; security of our nation &amp; our allies.
I fear the ramifications for our national security and I stand by my assertion that this report is flawed. http://t.co/Ejjm8tg7GV
Instead of a thorough, thoughtful redaction process, Dems chose to release more info for political reasons that only they understand.
In April, I voted to submit the Democrat’s study to the Executive Branch for redaction and, if appropriate, release. http://t.co/Ejjm8tg7GV
God Bless those killed and wounded during the Pearl Harbor attack and God bless all of our nation's veterans.

Filibustering such a bill is not only the height of hypocrisy, but also lays bare for the world the hollowness of this so-called strategy.
I voted today to advance the exact bill that a handful of my colleagues asked for.
March 22, 2013 I voted with @SenTedCruz to repeal and replace #Obamacare and @SenatorCrapo to repeal Obamacare's middle-class tax hikes.
This year I voted for @SenatorHatch’s amdt to repeal the medical device tax, which I discussed last evening: http://t.co/LxU1gcRiBT
On 04/14/11 the first concurrent resolution to defund #Obamacare was offered -- Senate Dems chose to continue funding.
April 2011, another vote to repeal the 1099 reporting requirement.
In February of 2011, I supported @McConnellPress in his amendment to repeal #Obamacare – it was voted down by Senate Dems.
We voted to repeal 1099 reporting requirements.
Since final passage, GOPs have continually voted against #Obamacare. In 2010 we voted to repeal HHS regulation on grandfathered plans.
Finally, I joined all of my fellow Republicans to OPPOSE final passage of #Obamacare.
I fought every one of @SenatorReid’s procedural tactics to move #Obamacare forward on the Senate floor.
Once brought to the floor, my colleagues and I raised two points of order challenging the constitutionality of #Obamacare.
In the Finance Committee, I fought Dems effort to raise taxes on the middle class. #Obamacare
Moving into December, I voted for the Gregg amdt to keep Senate Dems from raiding Medicare to fund #Obamacare.
The fight against #Obamacare moved to the Finance Committee where I voted to strike Medicare &amp; Medicare Advantage cuts &amp; home health cuts.
Mikulski offered the contraception mandate again and again I voted NO.
On the 15th of July, the HELP Committee wanted to report #Obamacare to the floor which I strongly voiced my opposition.
On July 14, 2009, @TomCoburn offered a substitute to #Obamacare – the Patient’s Choice Act – a piece we that we wrote together.
Realizing it would destroy businesses, @SenatorHatch offered amdt to terminate employer mandate if it lowered wages or caused job loss.
I offered another amendment to provide no funding to #Obamacare unless Medicare is solvent.
.@SenatorBarb then offered the contraception mandate, which all @GOPHELP members voted AGAINST.
Together, @TomCoburn and I offered admts that would have struck the employer mandate &amp; any government-run insurance plans.
Because @SenAlexander’s earlier amdt failed due to HELP Dems, @TomCoburn offered another admt to strike Medicaid expansion.
I offered an amendment that would keep insurance provisions from taking effect if they increased costs. Unsurprisingly, Dems defeated it.
.@SenatorEnzi’s amdt would've capped growth of #Obamacare premium subsidies and would eliminate subsidies for people over a certain income.
We also voted for Roberts’ amdt to strike tax hikes, Medicare cuts, and employer penalties.
At the start of July in ’09 a multitude of admts were offered by GOPs on HELP, including @SenAlexander’s amdt to strike Medicaid expansion.
The next day, I supported @TomCoburn’s admt to prevent the addition of new bureaucrats at HHS. #wastefulspending
On 6/23/09, I voted to block a new #Obamacare Public Health Fund, an amdt offered by @SenatorHarkin.
Attempting to stop progress, I voted yes on 6/18/09 to Gregg amdt that would provide NO funding until there was a GAO study of costs.
When the debate #Obamacare began, my fellow GOPs and I on HELP committee stood together on countless amdts to stop it from moving forward.
I have voted 56 times to kill, repeal, dismantle, &amp; defund #Obamacare. I will continue to fight to get rid of this #trainwreck
