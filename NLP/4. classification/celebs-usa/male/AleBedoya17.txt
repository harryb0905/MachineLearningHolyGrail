@Mike_Stud You gotta come back to Philly another time when we not away for preseason bro 😂

Haha. I’d almost prefer listening to the game in Spanish. More energy and not have to hear Romo say 1,000 words to explain an under thrown pass. https://t.co/hufGClxmWI
Yes. That one and the Audi one were the best ones so far. 2 for 20ish lol https://t.co/8u9Rq7oXnF
This has been one boring game. And the commercials have been meh at best.
Congrats to @JOEL9ONE for winning NFL’s Man of the Year award. A champion on and off the field. Congrats on being inspirational and making a difference in our communities. 👏
@EricWynalda Thanks Eric. An emotional time &amp; such a tragedy. Really hope they don’t stop searching to give the families some peace. The support &amp;  tributes from the soccer community has been very moving. Best of luck to you this season.

@JeremyPond Exactly bro! And I’m saying this as a Dolphins fan. I love sports and gotta appreciate greatness no matter what.
How can you hate on greatness? The guy went down the field, tied the game with less than 2 minutes in regulation and still had 3 timeouts left. And then led them to another OT postseason win to get to another Super Bowl. 🐐 https://t.co/EW0WLwVGY0
Remember when the NFL was dying last year? 😂 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 🤣   What an unbelievable day of football.

@ArchBell Being back home and cleaning out my closet brought back some nostalgia. Good to see you still at it. All the best for you in this new year &amp; beyond.
@MartinJarmond Thanks Martin! Let me know next time you happen to be in Philly by any chance. All the best for the rest of the new year

@Brad_Self @clint_dempsey Haha I remember hearing this right after that game. It’s a great story! Hope you’re well Brad and Happy New Year.
At start of this game, Nike reps were upset about Clint wearing the newest Nike boots which he was supposed to wait another week to wear. After game, Nike used the images &amp; video of this goal everywhere. Another reason @clint_dempsey is a boss. What a golazo &amp; career! 🔥 https://t.co/o78DgLJJux

@JOEL9ONE I can tell you from experience playing against him when he was 17 years old while I was in France that was gonna be something special. He’s been highly rated as next big thing from an early age. Safe to say he’s gonna be a superstar.
@FOXSportsPR @JennyTaft @KMbappe très impressionnant de vous voir parler français @JennyTaft. Je ne savais pas que tu pouvais. Bravo 👏

@AbnerSean Sh*t, you and I both my man.
This has to be the best World Cup ever!  If it’s not, which one has been more thrilling?  I can’t possibly fathom there was a World Cup with more stoppage time goals, favorites to win losing and as exciting, full of drama, as this one.
That run by Lukaku to come inside and leave the flank open for De Bruyne to play that pass out wide and then for him to make another run and dummy it for Chadli to score was just 🔥 🔥 🔥. What a counter attack and game. #InstantClassic
A lot of respect for this guy. Congrats to Åge Hareide and the Denmark team on a good run in this World Cup. #DEN https://t.co/lFB9SK8519
@marceloclaure Haha same for my father with Sony. Saludos.

@INTERlORS Isn’t this former Ralph Lauren’s creative directors’ home in Montclair, NJ?
@TheSwickster @thegoalkeeper So let’s assume you’re right in believing that I said what he says I said (which isn’t true). Why didn’t he turn around immediately after me “shouting at him?” He comes to me only after my motion into the “D” when I’m saying nothing.
On another note, saddened to hear about the passing of Anthony Bourdain. Loved watching his show.  He opened my eyes to an understanding of foreign cultures through food and what it meant to live a life full of adventures &amp; experiences. RIP. 🙏
That’s my issue. Why not just state I violated “(insert here) laws of the game?” So, all goalkeepers should automatically get yellow cards for standing in front of ball or stepping off their line to delay a PK without a speaking to first?#NoMoreGamesmanship #FeelTheGame https://t.co/rKfwGL4HRn
The referee report states that I received a second yellow for dissent through words.  This is simply NOT true.  I bent over to adjust my sock in the “D” area just outside the box &amp; said absolutely nothing to the referee.  It's a shame that this clear error hasn't been corrected. https://t.co/tW5exyZe8m
@marceloclaure @SoftBank @nikesharora @PaloAltoNtwks From one @BostonCollege alum to another, congrats Nikesh! 👏
@christiangideon That’s why I was so vocal when Trump &amp; his ignorant followers would slander Sweden. People just believe what they read instead of immersing themselves in the beautiful culture &amp; country that it is.

My first time ever to Europe was to London in August of 2003. I wore my brand new yellow jersey with Henry on the back &amp; was able to catch the first game of the “Invincible” season. That Arsenal team made me fall in love with soccer. Merci Beaucoup Arsène Wenger.

This is beautiful. So much respect for this and for these 2 legends of the game. 🙏 https://t.co/5QkubkAotV
Yup! 50-50 on the penalty being called but Buffon shouldn’t have got a red card. Would’ve loved to see him save the penalty &amp; be a hero. But the way Ronaldo hit that penalty..... wow 🚀. https://t.co/PIQpKjd4QI
@CAdams7 I don’t disagree with you regarding the penalty. But, Buffon is the captain &amp; has every right to go &amp; speak with the ref. And composure is not easy when the stakes are this high &amp; you’re passionate. Ref should deal with it. It’s not like he slapped him. Gigi was being shoved.
⚽️.... the most beautiful sport but also the cruelest. I love this game!
@WillBlackmon Haha well played bro!
I’m just a fan of the game and passionate about it. Would much rather have a game like this settled in the run of play/shootout &amp; not a last second debatable penalty. And I also don’t agree with giving Buffon a red card there! #Harsh https://t.co/0evWqesgwF
And once again, a referee decides to become the protagonist of an amazing game and ruins it.

@Doc_DAnderson I’m sorry it came off that way. Not enough characters. There is a high number that do suffer from it and we need to do more to help them out. Like I mentioned, more preventive measures need to be put in place for everyone. More guns is not the answer.
@ethanbg2002 @igoodwin24 Oh that’s cute. I love how you posted a picture of an M-14 without the magazine clip on it to try to make your point. Keep your handguns/pistol for defense or bolt action rifle &amp; shotgun for hunting. Ban the rest. Only licensed ranges should have access to weapons of war.
Yeah you’re right. I’m talking about an issue where people are dying. But go ahead and make the connection that I don’t value representing my country and act like I didn’t care about missing the World Cup. Some people man. 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/wlSvykWtxe
Exactly. Too many people with their fantasies think some Hollywood movie scenario will play out. We need more preventive measures so that it doesn’t happen. https://t.co/ubVNheEee1
Yeah and while that sucks, I’m alive and enjoying life. Others are NOT. Get a grip. https://t.co/NxA3YWE5dh
Yea great idea. More guns! Let’s give teachers who already have a lot to cope with, stressed out &amp; are underpaid guns &amp; expect them to hit a moving target.

I’ll call out blatant hypocrisy &amp; rhetoric that is divisive when I see &amp; hear it. I know you’re not ignorant like her to say us athletes should just shut up! So tweet wasn’t directed at you. We’ve had our civil discourse the way it should be. 👍 https://t.co/ViNSsGsq3K

Watching Women’s Slopestyle and it’s beyond ridiculous that they can’t go on another day. These talented women putting their bodies at risk with those wind conditions and wiping out isn’t fun to watch or fair to them! 4 years of training for this?
@JimSias @ChipotleTweets But what’s a date night without a Dumb and Dumber toilet scene. 🤷‍♂️ 🤣
Congrats @CACSoccer on becoming president of @ussoccer. Looking forward to a bright and a more inclusive future.  Te deseo lo mejor en el futuro y felicidades!
Impressed by @MalcolmJenkins on the @VanJones68 show. Eagles like him, @JOEL9ONE, &amp; @TorreySmithWR getting it done both on and off the field. 👏 👍 https://t.co/fgpBJ8p40o
@MattSiniscalchi @AntFontana99 He’s learning! 80/20 is the code I live by. ;)
@WillBlackmon Barca!!
@GrantWahl Can we vote on getting you a phone upgrade? #BlurryResults 🤣 😂
As a father, I commend your effort to make your son happy and his dreams fulfilled. 👏 My advice for your son: “hard work beats talent, when talent does work hard.” Wishing you guys all the best! https://t.co/JoZJhNxYpo
Probably. Who knows what would’ve happened. However, I was always up for a challenge and never afraid to take risks. https://t.co/zafEqAGqjr
I still have notes from youth &amp; college coaches telling me I wouldn’t make it because I was too skinny &amp; short. Whatever perspective one may have, we can all appreciate your candor.👍 https://t.co/Wj6KRsMPRp
Proud of the journey &amp; all of the success my friend @CarlosCamposNYC has had! He’s the epitome of the American Dream.  https://t.co/mYQ2MTKToN
@_piscesiscariot STAC??? I graduated from STA high school in ‘05.
Always proud of having been a student-athlete at STA!  Congrats to all the student-athletes on the next stage in your careers. #STAPride #STAndard https://t.co/3ooiaAsYF2
I learned that the hard way while living in Glasgow. Was holding up the peace sign and got bombarded by some harsh words. Took me by surprise to say the least. 🤣 😂 https://t.co/vAA8TveQEy
Man, @JOEL9ONE @Beau_Allen @fcoxx_91 and @Lanejohnson65 would make great WWE entertainers! And can’t forget about the hype man @JasonKelce. https://t.co/K2RbIGLYD7
😂 🤣 I think you’re onto something here bro! More fun than a coin toss.  We’ll bring out the dice next! Highest number gets to choose ball or side to defend. 🎲 https://t.co/46Zfvqpwwm
Jason Kelce. What a speech!! Now that’s that Philly attitude. 🥊
@MartinJarmond Wish I was back in Philly for this. You should’ve stayed for the parade! Haha
@JawuanJames70 My man!! Sometimes we get caught up in our own world so much we don’t acknowledge everything that needs to happen behind the scenes to allow us this lifestyle! 🙏 Hope you’re well and back even stronger! 💪
Shoutout to all the players’ spouses who stay at home while we are away for long periods like preseason! #YouTheRealMVP  Sucks to be away when both my kids got the flu &amp; mommy is sick also!😔

@aaronjones_19 @PhilaUnion What a banger! Go in big man. Congrats on that great goal mate. First of many! 👀 ⚽️
@Strangeland_Elf Appreciate the earnest discourse. Tough to be a moderate in this political climate when people on left and right cling to such extremes.

@herculezg should've told those companies with their progressive commercials.... ;)
This is why we love sports. What a game!! #SB51  What a moment for James White with game winning touchdown. #SaintThomasAquinas pride.

However, I still think Shake Shack is the best with a better burger but the animal style fries are an upgrade! #my2cents 🍔🍟
Well, have to say that In-N-Out was a great experience. That was a real good burger. Double Double animal style w/ animal style fries! 👌 https://t.co/qcctb1piu5

@luisakalefty insurance policy doesn't cover what he could've made &amp; ACL injury is a very serious one that some don't recover fully from.
Damn. And we're stuck watching well paid guys on College Gameday arguing whether a kid should sit out a game &amp; not risk losing millions.😱😴 https://t.co/9JMzlDc9jX

@SuperIgor @FrancoPanizo man it's been my first Christmas down here in 8 years so I'm really enjoying being down here right now!
@AlexiLalas but it's like the cool kind of cool, ya know. Not where you have to wear that hat you wore in Toronto! 😉
I almost forgot how amazing winter in south Florida is!! Happy to be back home and am loving this weather. 🌞🌴👍
@FCLorient @warisgh10 congrats bro! Keep going strong 💪👍👏🙏.

@stuholden hahah I was thinking more like being influenced by the Parisians coming from France! ;)
Need help from my Philly peeps. I've got clothes/shoes/items I'd like to donate. Please DM me with suggestions of charities in the area.

@LeanderAlphabet @A_W_Gordon @kenearlys surely it has a lot to do with live streaming services. For many, a lot cheaper &amp; more convenient.

Just pointing out hypocrisy. Go out and support your NWSL team &amp; the league for continued growth. Increase in revenue helps increase in pay.
We, the consumer, are just as part of the problem as FIFA, corporations, TV networks, etc.  It's easy to spend other people's money.
Regarding last RT, I've never ever said to not reward our USWNT. This is a complex complicated issue &amp; cherry picking data doesn't help.
This is a good read. Thanks for sharing. https://t.co/FcD2Dsh9bz
@DannyPage I've never said not to reward them. It's a complicated complex issue in part b/c of different ways each has negotiated their CBA.
@DannyPage umm you do realize actual real numbers mean more than projected numbers.
@TheOffsideRules it's pretty scary man. Our country is so divisive it's concerning for the future.
I'd say today's Uber drive into training was interesting to say the least.  Listening to Trump support while wearing a Russia jacket....... https://t.co/VkNQnVfDd6
Out of 320+ million, it's come down to these 2 candidates for president. We chose them. #Concerning
I'm not a history buff but is this the dirtiest, sleaziest presidential election ever? So many lies, double standards and lots of hypocrisy.
Without hesitation, YES! One of my fave places I've played in.  Great crazy atmosphere &amp; architectural design of stadium is a sight to see. https://t.co/Ii0uy6ajiu
To all my friends &amp; family in South Florida, do what's necessary to stay safe! Thoughts &amp; prayers to those affected. #HurricaneMatthew

@Dannycruz5 @MauriceEdu ok I'll defo check them out but I know Mo won't b/c he doesn't drink coffee haha. Thanks for the shout. 👍

Haha I knew I would get one response like this lol. Starbucks for me is only for dire needs like at an airport. 😜 https://t.co/thM3F1LcuS
@Strangeland_Elf I don't disagree with that at all. Instead of using the word hate try to gain perspective and why it is that way.
These all look like great spots! Love the look of Coava. Going to check these out! Thanks 👍 https://t.co/xfILOe23ZV
Got wifi on the plane as we head over to Portland! Looking for the best coffee shop in Portland.  Any recommendations for a quality ☕️?

Well, reach is different than actual viewership. But shouldn't be surprise that soccer reach # is greater globally. https://t.co/cN56Dgt1Aa
No doubt NFL is king in USA, but still pretty impressive #'s for a soccer game starting at 7:30am ET/4:30am PT.  https://t.co/9B22wMmAWh
If you passed out like me last night before seeing the best play of this game, make sure you listen to this call! 😂😂 https://t.co/R9Q1WomNLZ
If this thing was at my house, I have a feeling it would scare the 💩 out of me! #BedoyaBox the new Chucky doll. Lol https://t.co/q7Tw7mITM3
Not good enough. A game we should've put away w/ another goal! We must &amp; will do better! Thanks fans for your support! #OntoTheNextOne #DOOP
@CarlosCamposNYC hermano!! I'm only 1.5 hours away from NYC! When is your next show? Hope to see you around soon when I get a chance. Abrazo

@christiangideon you in Philly?
Wow big news for @MLS! Number 10 is taken so I wonder if the man @landondonovan comes back wearing the 45? 😉
It's that time of the year again. NFL is back! Let the fantasy football fun begin. Our league is #DOOP. https://t.co/KxVlIf6n5o
@Nicocantor1 yea I mean it's definitely different but I think concern is also risk of injury.
Well said. It's water under the bridge now. You live &amp; you learn &amp; we move on. We all on the same team! 🇺🇸  https://t.co/QyN8VWvNSL
Yeah, those would be my top 3 as well but I could also see Bayern, Liverpool, and Real Madrid in there.  https://t.co/PnAIj7OKIC
@Cnyari @AmericanOutlaws yup. That's why it's the beautiful game the way it brings all types of people, from all over, together.
Woah that's almost as many as @AmericanOutlaws! But AO are way better! ;) 🇺🇸. All helping to grow this game here.👍 https://t.co/bkfiVsI3kX
@thecenterpiece1 @FCBarcelona or also by geographical locations. In Boston for example a lot of Liverpool and Celtic fans.
This is pretty cool. Makes me wonder, which European team is the most supported team by American fans?  https://t.co/XZwReusldb
@LeanderAlphabet more authentic feel of those dark times in Colombia. Pablo isn't as glorified as in Narcos &amp; see him for psychopath he is.
@SteveDavis90 you won't be disappointed Steve! Hope you're well
@amobisays much more authentic with Pablo's character speaking with proper Colombian accent haha.
It's great. Halfway through season 2 but as a Colombian-American, I recommend you watch El Patron Del Mal.  https://t.co/bIoadVNVAk
Yeah I like the digital content MLS has been putting out. Enjoy the series @CalenCarr helps put together. https://t.co/FQws0AB5G9

@EricWynalda @eddie_robinson2 @FieldhouseNYC he must've missed your show just now. The airs been cleared. We've moved on, life goes on. 🇺🇸
And now back to our regularly scheduled programming. Beautiful clear blue skies here on east coast.😎👍  Look forward to being back in Philly.
@AndresCantorGOL @EricWynalda oh Andres I don't disagree with that. No denying his play as a player but don't believe him to be objective.
Fair enough. Got caught in heat of moment &amp; went a little too far. My bad. Tomorrow is a new day.  https://t.co/FDXpUVtWs8
You're dislike for me for is no secret. I sacrifice a lot to strive for better. I've earned everything. #LifeGoesOn https://t.co/CkT8BVtWy0
Never seen someone try so hard to remain relevant. Begs for coaching jobs, TV commentator, analyst &amp; a random radio show. You're a #HasBeen.
I can take criticism. Last night I was off my game &amp; not good enough but this dude has a well documented dislike for me that I don't get.
Onto the Hex! Good professional performance from the boys these last 2 games! #USMNT  And now back to Philly for that playoff push! #DOOP
Growing up in FL, I watched a lot of UM football. Those Canes could ball. That 2001 nat'l champs team is best ever. https://t.co/Yha0roy7AO
Disappointing. Been a tough few years for BC football. I was spoiled back when I was there with @M_Ryan02 as our QB! https://t.co/889QYBCfyk

A little birdie told me future expansion fees could approach 200 Million dollars.... I don't know.... Just saying. https://t.co/YrUsJwI4FX
Between that call against us &amp; Seattle's "goal line clearance" last night, goal line technology should be implemented in our game.
Ahhhh so this angle makes the goal even more clear!🙄 How can the linesman be so sure it crossed line from his angle? https://t.co/SZH1X6cN4X
Great effort from the boys tonight!! Huge 3 points &amp; a big shout out to @K_J_Rose on his game winning goal! #RookieOfTheYear #DOOP
@yedlinny @NUFC congrats bro! All the best man but please stay away from the Geordie Shore!! 😂
@GrantWahl @KVanValkenburg nice read. I'm sure @J_No24 loved seeing Zlatan score but I wasn't too happy he did it against me &amp; my team! Haha
So I see Zlatan is already struggling in the Premier League like so many predicted......... 😴

@derekc6713 no because those USA national team players would rep. Americans. Int'l refers to players from other countries.
Ok guess that should've been a poll. Let's see what #MLS fans prefer to watch become the #AllStarGame!  Vote here!👀
What format do #MLS fans prefer?  MLS All Star v. Big European club MLS East v MLS West MLS Best Americans v MLS best International players.
And talking about All Star Game, I find it interesting Ligue 1 is in process of having one! French players v. International Ligue 1 players.
Good luck to all the guys in the #MLSAllStar game tonight! Look forward to catching some good highlights tomorrow morning.
Haha this is what preseason life will do to you coach! You get used to saying Pounds instead of "stones?" 😬 https://t.co/bJGu3uypwb
And why can't we all agree that the ground floor in buildings is 0 or lobby &amp; first floor is actually 1 in elevators?  #HotelRoomThoughts
@jack_steele97 yea that's why I said like the only one... Makes it 3 out of almost 200.
@HeathGPearce hey man, preseason life lol
And why is USA like the only country in world to not adopt metric system? Could've made living in Europe easier haha. #HotelRoomThoughts
Also, this ⚽️ is a football. This 🏈shouldn't be a football but called maybe handball or something else. #HotelRoomThoughts
Yup and I wear them mostly on a 'field' and no it's not a pasture for cows or horses!  https://t.co/iJoM0KIZe4
@SoccerByIves ok I'll YouTube him and see what else will make me kill some time haha
Why do Brits make fun of us Americans for saying soccer &amp; not football yet 1 of their most popular shows is Soccer AM? #HotelRoomThoughts
@Futfanatico yes so true. It's always an issue for me when doing media having to switch back &amp; forth from answering in English and Spanish.
How about, why do we drive our cars on parkways but park them in driveways?  #HotelRoomThoughts
@the_bonnfire hahah depends on what it's about ;)
Or why is "abbreviation" such a long word? #HotelRoomThoughts
Anybody else wonder why more psychics haven't won the lottery? #HotelRoomThoughts

Just as bad as "stick to sports" rhetoric. I'm an American. It's about morals, values, knowledge &amp; not being naive. https://t.co/3IvPItLswG
People need to be more thoughtful voters. Not mindless, partisan zombies. Policies should matter more than a D or R next to their names.
Anyone else think abolishing 2 party system would be beneficial? Parties make everything black &amp; white and I'm a gray thinker. #Individuals
This election 👎. Seems most will vote, not for whose policies they actually agree with/like, but for who they dislike the least. #SoMuchHate

@robbiemustoe beauty of football, isn't it. Many ways to play it but more remarkable is getting all players, egos aside, to buy into tactics
Vad fan händer @JALV82BAGE? Hoppas att supporter, som kastade saker, spelar FIFA hemma och är förbjuden från arena under en längre tid.

I got my degree from BC's Carroll School of Management. Studied finance &amp; economics. Thanks for your educated reply. https://t.co/0UCm0QmsJJ
In previous tweet I said they deserve more. Pay discrepancies in per diems &amp; sponsor appearances should be equal. https://t.co/JuCTaGta7l
Why the animosity. We're all fans of USWNT &amp; have a lot to thank them for. They deserve more. It was a question. https://t.co/1yqx2Vt87F
Carli, huge fan. Just curious. Would you give up your guaranteed salary + benefits for same bonus structure as men? https://t.co/iPwSrxWPcy
@shinguardian @AndrewDasNYT finally someone in media who has taken a more objective point of view.
I once helped @dutkae with a school project. Now, she needs all OUR help after home got destroyed by Houston floods. https://t.co/cyubffTWIG
Just let me know where you will be in the stadium! 👍 https://t.co/c0ItDNJd7M
A picture says a lot. Happy to be back from injury, but hate to lose!  We must fight now to end the season well.#FCN https://t.co/OcmBWBzDIt
Huge game on live TV right now in France for Bob Bradley. Rooting for an important Le Havre win towards promotion. Cc: @JeffreyPBradley
@MauriceEdu nah bro... All about the Taurus.
@JeremyPond nope. Only the finest specialty coffee straight from our family farm in Colombia!
@amyinsyl @SpecialtyCoffee runs through Sunday night. If you have time, check out booth 125 &amp; my sister will offer you our specialty coffee!
If you're in Atlanta, go check out the @SpecialtyCoffee event &amp; stop by my family's coffee business stand!  #Booth125 #MAScafe #SCAA2016
@GrantWahl w/o ads there is no sports! The jerseys sold at retail won't even have the corporate logos haha #KeepPlayingAndWatching
@BrunoAKSG of course Bruno! Gotta be able to read between the lines...The Liverpool game last night is a fine example of emotions in 90 min.
@delbello_rom haha. Pour moi, le match de la année!
Soccer is so boring.
Juergen Klopp. You'll Never Walk Alone!  Wow, what scenes at Anfield. #BVBLFC
Well, things just got a whole lot more interesting! #LFCBVB
@GrantWahl Gonna go out on a limb &amp; say he probably said something about revenue generated by each World Cup due to TV rights &amp; sponsors?
What a night in NBA! Kobe 60 points in last game, Curry 400 3-pointers &amp; Warriors 73 wins! #History #Greatness
@JeremyPond I'd like to attend Kobe's last game but since I can't, I would prefer to watch Warriors on TV. Does that make sense?
@brooklynaguirre well I'm sure you can sneak into one of those suites and watch those games on a TV! Haha
And real Lakers fans will know that Vlade Divac is the real MVP! 😜 https://t.co/KelBGH4oUW
@herculezg yup. But if you could only attend one game, which one would you pick?
Agree. You should do an NBA-Soccer analysis.  Spurs ball movement a la Barca's tiki taka etc. haha  https://t.co/TqOjyj9JiT
One day, I hope MLS will have similar TV ratings. But, disagree about And1. The Professor &amp; Hot Sauce is not NBA.  https://t.co/N4HcaOp9Oa
@MorganCarlston well, in that case, let's go Panthers!
Yeah that's true. I think Kobe game is better for pre &amp; post game but Warriors are going for history. #CurryShow  https://t.co/f4lbSuTFUk
@pedronavas820 yea, should be interesting to see Heats first round matchup.
So, Kobe Bryant's last game or Golden State Warriors going for a record 73 wins?
Haha decent set up. Looking forward to 2 great games! https://t.co/4OJiU0QTva
Shame that these 2 quarterfinal Champions League games are on at the same time! I think PSG will go through but not sure about Real Madrid.
Quite the welcoming we got in Paris just now..... 😂😂 https://t.co/kyGComUE5S
When I lived in Sweden, I had no problems talking to random Swedes. Well, now you can also. Pretty cool initiative. https://t.co/CmZ3zHu9Ah
Is there ever not an amazing atmosphere at Borussia Dortmund's stadium? This feels more like a Champions League night. #YoullNeverWalkAlone
@ldock93 I think PSG has a better shot. It'll be like one way traffic at Bernabeau, but Wolfsburg has shown it can hit them on the counter.
@FGrimesN7 well I thought PSG would absolutely win at home... Both games will be real interesting though!
Pretty unexpected results tonight in Champions League! Do you still think PSG &amp; Real Madrid will pull through to the semifinals?
@sonealuko your goal in the Old Firm game!... 😱👍👌👏 #beepbeep
@AJD_20 haha we have that same giraffe and he loves it!
Huge congrats to my former teammates &amp; the whole club @RangersFC for getting back to where they belong! #SimplyTheBest #PennyArcade
@BrekShea that was a golazo bro! Congrats. Saw Alec in Miami &amp; he said what up.
@EricWynalda so you want me to be the Spanish version of Karate Kid? ;) Haha
@EricWynalda wow what Eric!? Would you like to explain!?.....
I expected more from an 'Emmy Award Winning' journalist.  Didn't know winning in sports justifies certain actions. https://t.co/4FAJWqXM0Z
Just FYI, someone born outside of the USA to parents who serve the American military are Americans.  https://t.co/QyP6zEHDEt
I almost forgot that I have to be politically correct because I'm an athlete. We're human. Abby took full responsibility. Good. #1N1T #USWNT
And if you can dish out criticism, like make xenophobic comments, than I'm sure you can take criticism also when you mess up.
So, what I'm learning now via Twitter is that some people value athletic achievement more than human life.... Got that.
@OrlandoHotspurs and if you had ANY ability at all, you would maybe be a professional. ✌️
@FOXSoccer must've been a foreign American player's fault.......
On another note, I'm not a fan of games like #ElClasico being played the weekend right after FIFA international break!
@herculezg was talking about it other day. A real goal scorer has his shot go through goalies legs. I try that, and of course it doesn't lol
I wonder how USMNT fans feel about Suarez's finishing today..... Sometimes, ball just won't go in &amp; unlucky or good saves.Onto the next one.
@BeaHilland gets home from Australia in an hour.  Told her I'd have house cleaned up &amp; lunch ready. Except, she forgot it's #AprilFools 😘😲😂
Anyways, great win on Tuesday night! Columbus, an awesome support &amp; venue. Now, gonna fight this jet-lag hard by playing some Call of Duty!
Oh I will! Haha  My hair doesn't stop me from creating chances &amp; giving 110% effort when I step out onto the pitch. https://t.co/JAlSfXlS48
LOL at people still tweeting me about my hair to blame for a loss! Where were you when I was scoring &amp; assisting w/ same hair style!? Haha
Oyeeee Parcero! Was reading GQ on flight to France &amp; saw you made this list! 🙈😂 @JuanPaGalavis haha #11 https://t.co/RTnopxmQMM
So happy for you guys! Coffee and white noise will be your best friends! ;) https://t.co/isI2GSbNjt
Another day at the office. Game day v. Lyon! #focused #FCN https://t.co/AhxXFAbWin
@alecko11 haha I'll take you up on that offer as long as we sign deal over a nice Armenian meal! ;) Good luck w/ this season.
@alecko11 oh I agree w/ you 100%. Culture not there yet but it's slowly getting there w/ more money &amp; better coaching-Less about wins at U12
With over 300 million people, we'll get there 1 day! Kids here play all year. In college, I was limited to 3 months. https://t.co/w32EXMbIKu
I guess I see it more often because I live in France, but they've got some serious talent: Pogba, Martial, Coman, Fekir, Dembele, Lemar etc.
Kingsley Coman was just playing here in France for PSG 2 years ago. Now on loan at Bayern from Juventus! Not bad for a 19 year old.
Das football!  What a game.
@mas_cafe_ maybe @BocaBoca3 can make an appearance at my sisters coffee stand! ;)
I will gladly take you up on that offer. You're offering right? ;)  https://t.co/39Gp3FiSdV
This is very true. We're talking over the course of 9 months &amp; not a tournament where a hot streak lasts a few games https://t.co/OLpqo20dGP
Yeah you're right. USA hockey, best sports moment of 20th Century.  Leicester for 21st Century. Better? ;) https://t.co/jMaJSmTbhQ
Big Leicester City win tonight. What an amazing story it will be if they win the Premier League! There's no comparable sport parallel.
@erik_edman March Madness baby!! I'm going with Kansas but watch out for Miami! ;)

Happy Monday everyone. New week with new possibilities. Let's get after it! Remember, happiness is a conscious choice....
@JimSias yup. Have you seen Payet's free kick goal this weekend? He knew it as soon as he kicked it.
Oh my! What a golazo by Amarikwa for San Jose!  That's gotta be goal of the year! #MLS
Hearing French pronounce Yankee stadium as "Junkie" stadium is pretty funny. Good half by NYCFC but late goal could help TFC back into game.
Got my feet up watching some #MLS action! Toronto vs NYC FC. Funny to see my man @Ahmed_Sylla in the studio &amp; predict 2 goals for Giovinco.
Très belle et important victoire aujourd'hui devant un public impressionnant! On continue à rêver! #FCN #Nantes
@MattChambrs great chat my man and looking forward to integrating our ideas together to create awesome projects!
@MauricioSports it's a GPS system that analyzes certain stats per player. Like distance covered, speed, accelerations, jumps etc.
So do people(mostly in England) still think Zlatan isn't 'World Class' because he hasn't played in England or done well before v. BPL clubs?
The Dragon @Goran_Dragic has been spitting fire these days for the Heat! 🔥🔥 He &amp; @LuolDeng9 playing great for Miami &amp; my fantasy team! 👏
@RangersFC get in there Captain Waldo!
@SachaKljestan @iamjohnoliver 👍👌 I tried to come up with the best words possible for this but I don't have any.

Woke up and saw the game that @Dame_Lillard had! What a beast.  So tell me again why he wasn't an All-Star? #NBA
Always up to something...... But I will always win at this game @adryantavares!  https://t.co/I1f3CGyVfJ
On another note, I think it's a damn shame that our game against Bastia is postponed this weekend!....
Going to miss you dad! 😜  Non il est pas moi et il n'a aucune relation avec moi!! https://t.co/Rc6rvhQinA
@JasonLaCanfora hahha my whole fantasy league knows where my "sources" come from!
@thehotrain it was awesome! I loved it. Sweden is beautiful and has a great culture
@GrantWahl and when I was living in Sweden, I always wondered why the Frölunda hockey's team logo was an Indian... https://t.co/U2xhY6e2xh

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major!
@anotherjuan @BeaHilland tough love! ;) haha
@ErikHammill as of now we play that Saturday. You're more than welcome man
@mffl70 yup now onto flooring and more expense lol
Well, yeah. The key to any financial decision is to be responsible whether using credit or debit.  https://t.co/cHuGUAz9ow
Yes. Also to take advantage of rewards/bonuses plus fraud protection. But mainly to start building credit for future https://t.co/BBIPJ04HJw
If I learned anything and were to offer any advice to young adults it would be to prefer credit cards over debit cards.
Having been this patient for so long, I just wanna celebrate! But gotta be even more patient now. Shots &amp; drinks can wait until offseason.😜
So, homeownership isn't all enjoyable as it may seem. After 5 months of back and forth, I have finally closed on this property! #Alelujah
@JeffreyPBradley Agree. Athletes talk about failure more than anyone else. Some just aren't good at it, understandably, esp. when emotional.
@JeffreyPBradley and if he acted the opposite well he wasn't ready &amp; not professional enough..... Media wants passion, until they don't.
Hmmm this guy seems to have it all figured out! Haha What you guys think?  https://t.co/RiVJgiwAkB
@shinguardian @JeffreyPBradley oh those good old college days haha
@engiles well good thing there wasn't any time conflict between any of those games today lol
@JeffreyPBradley man if only I could get my hands on one of those Super Bowl stadium snack things over here in France!
What's your pick for #SuperBowlSunday?
@danielnyari I try and live by this: Formal education can make you a living but self education can make you a fortune. Keep on keeping on
@ochocinco come join @JuanPaGalavis to Paris in May when my team plays against PSG. A weekend of soccer, fashion, art, &amp; cigars.
@TheOffsideRules this is where you and Team Epiphany and Sky etc. get involved! ;) haha
Great player &amp; even better person! Congrats on everything @stuholden! That 2013 Gold Cup was for you! Zedd- Clarity will always be our song.
@ErikHammill you let me know and I'll hook you up
@shinguardian haha I used One Hour Translation for my mortgage loan documents but that came out to be pretty expensive....
@JeffreyPBradley sorry but 140 character limit takes away my ability to help out. How is Bob's French coming along?

No way. After living in the UK, there's no way bowling is better than darts! The sound of 180 &amp; chugging beers! Lol https://t.co/stYFNgYbpc
I thought I'd tune in early &amp; watch a preview of the game. Instead, I'm stuck watching freaking bowling! Ps. I've bowled better than Barrett
@aronjo20 @ussoccer @footballiceland you think Kolbeinn is watching the game? I have a bet with him hahah
Good luck to the boys @ussoccer today! Kick off 2016 right and let's beat all them "son's," son.  #USAvISL #USMNT

Only makes sense for a best offense #Cardinals v. best defense #Broncos in #SuperBowl but I gotta support @LukeKuechly. Man is a beast! #BC
What a game! Gronk is the man though. Brady gonna go down as 🐐. Sorry @GeoffCameron and @CharlieDavies9. Unlucky.
@aronjo20 nice win! Tell Papy Djilobodji that I say he needs to work on his dance moves! Haha
Happy to have scored again last night &amp; make it 2-0. But had to bite my tongue after the game when it finished 2-2! https://t.co/Lj5KfiV7FT

It was my 1st touch of the game! As you can see from video I had just been subbed on &amp; took me 15 sec. to score haha https://t.co/62YLrJDUdN
My goal last night is what keyboard warriors think Pro sports is like. "So easy, he sucks. I could've done that!" https://t.co/1kcl8X0F8L
Certainly the fastest goal I've ever scored,10 seconds after coming on with my first touch!😂 And wow it was cold! -7C/19F #OntoTheNextRound

@JimSias I can't even drink with my friend Johnnie on NYE! :(

@Enquirer @G_Bernard25 @EnquirerDoc great story bro! Inspiring. I'm sure my boy @JozyAltidore can relate. Happy birthday &amp; keep ballin man.
@Emaboateng @BeaHilland my man. What haven't I done for her haha... Hope you're well.
@LeanderAlphabet merci beaucoup, mon ami.
Had my first full interview in French today. Here are some quotes from it, in French of course.  https://t.co/U8Fuhtz5K6
Big games! How will temporary grass fields hold up? Hope it doesn't affect safety, aesthetics &amp; quality of play. https://t.co/AKbICent0Y
@Migue10Ibarra @KyleBeckerman @ochocinco haha at least he kept his mouth shut... Can't wait I'll he wakes up for payback lol
Hahahahhaha Got him!! Hey @KyleBeckerman how you gonna let @ochocinco do that to you!?...  https://t.co/fUcStj8XqK
And add this one to his legendary quotes! 😂 https://t.co/CrHUPv1m4H
And Zlatan has just Zlataned Sweden into Euro 2016.  Happy for my Swedish friends. :)
Real fans know that! ;) Still, I enjoyed my time on MSNBC talking with Brian Williams. The beautiful game prevails! https://t.co/psuh2NCKr8

Happy #VeteransDay. Home of the free, because of the brave!
@AlysonHL02 @ivanomartin right. Because science &amp; numbers have all the concrete evidence and is never misleading.
@sdshields fair enough. Appreciate the debate. 1 thing we can agree on is there needs to be more done in sport when some1 becomes concussed.
@sdshields I'm all about safety as a father but I can still tell my kid to use caution &amp; teach proper technique w/o banning heading.
@sdshields research I've seen shows every1 is diff. &amp; have diff. thresholds of force.  Also, many biological factors play into head trauma.
@sdshields I say moderation. Too many variables.Not enough concrete evidence in linear forces to suggest heading ball to brain abnormalities
@sdshields No neuroscientist but will kids need helmets at all times b/c repetitive hits to maturing brain causes neurological disturbances?
Why the heck kids 10 &amp; under practicing heading for? Most that age just enjoy kicking ball around &amp; having fun. Youth coaching the problem.
And for those saying it'll help development, I say to you that the belief this new policy will help w/ technique &amp; possession is ridiculous.
Kids are always running into things &amp; each other with their heads. Has "brain trauma" already formed &amp; later diagnosed from heading a ball?
As a parent to a 7 month old, I'm all about safety. I also know babies crawl, sit up, stand &amp; then fall and bang their head....
Are same people against heading a ball in soccer also against TV, phones, &amp; computers for their kids because of their cognitive development?
A lot of fuss about heading the ball in soccer! Like with most things in life, finding the right balance is key! #EverythingInModeration

@RobbieMc1873 we are rivals. Haha I'm a Dolphins fan.
@MLSAnalyst "yea dude that's a great idea!" Haha Just don't get why people lie about something that could so easily be verified.
Ben Carson's that guy recapping last night like, "Dude I was Shithammered last night! Must've had like 10 shots of tequila &amp; like 12 beers!"
Ben Carson is that guy who was All-State in High School but something suddenly happened and it derailed his college career....
@Rotoworld_FB @JessePantuosco nice job on the soccer reference of the Group of Death from the World Cup! 👍haha
If you figured it all out today, what would be the point of tomorrow?  Enjoy the process of being a work in progress.

@NewsbySmiley @GrantWahl NYCFC gets a team w/o their own stadium &amp; MLS in Miami only happens if they secure a new stadium deal?... $$$ talks
For those not familiar w/ Le Havre, it's an ambitious club w/  beautiful brand new stadium. Ready for Ligue 1. Bob Bradley likes challenges.
In another life, Benzema is a real life rapper. Wait, this stuff is helping with his street cred. #LikeARapVideo #ItsAMovie #NewAlbum #Jokes
@brad_evans3 well that only means that you've made it my man!! Plus I think you're cool. That's all that matters haha
Bien joué le gars!!! Tres bonne victoire à Nice! 3 points mérite. Allez @FCNantes!
I'm feeling a lot better. Have been back in training this week and hope to play very soon! 👍 https://t.co/4v61iaKV64

Hmmmm. I like my odds of scoring tonight against Marseille!..... From my couch still sick. :) #Put10BucksDown  https://t.co/c96TIPSBZ2
@LoneWolfNYC @alecko11 oh you mean like the '98 US World Cup team?!?.....
@alecko11 the feeling is mutual. You might not like hearing this but I was in high school watching you get MVP in MLS.😂#JerseyPride #Respect
@Chris_Whelan7 @alecko11 break down stigma against American player which I hope I've done to pave way for more U.S. players to Ligue 1 etc..
@alecko11 correct. How many times is next young player supposed to be next huge star/savior. Easy does it. USMNT will be 1 of best in future
Here's another angle. EPL isn't always only measuring stick if you're good enough. It's not 'best' league in world. https://t.co/YnedAuxQvx
@alecko11 here's another angle. The EPL isn't always only measuring stick if you're good enough. It's not the 'best' league in the world.
@danielnyari probably the same ones who hate on Ozil.
@JimSias ohhhhhhh. Well it's a good one to add to the Rolodex haha
@JimSias if you like sushi and Asian cuisine, I recommend going to Virago for a nice dinner!
Oh my! What a golazo parce! @JuanAgudelo  I owe you some Empanadas for that one lol
@TaylorTwellman fair enough. Just seems odd, that if it's about getting leg warmer, sitting on bench isn't going to help much. Hope Revs win
@rryanladd hey, not me nor anyone else is forcing you to follow me. 😴
@JohnnyLad5 @TaylorTwellman @periscopeco what!??... It's not even cold in DC! Makes no sense.
I decide to stay up for this game and my boy @CharlieDavies9 isn't starting in a must win game!??.... Why? https://t.co/7SBRflFjC8
Penalty et carton rouge!?.... Le arbitre c'est nul!!!
Merci! Allez Nantes! https://t.co/wBMZoDE6J6
Ce possible de regarder le FC Nantes en match de coupe ce soir dans le télé sur SFR?
If anything, the responses to my last tweet prove that MLS just might be the hardest league to bet on! Haha #parity  Good luck to all.
So #MLSCupPlayoffs start tonight. If you had to put your money on a team to win it all, who'd you pick? Asking for a friend. 😁
@AlxStrom @BeaHilland @HelsingborgsIF haha except this time I'm throwing bananas and turtle shells instead of footballs ;)
@EddiePitch Trust me. Lots of European players interested in MLS. USA has top notch facilities. More youth dev. &amp; MLS will be 1 of best.
Yeah, and so am I. And probably every other footballer out there. 😜👍 https://t.co/v5lsJ1ARtU
@espn @herculezg so what you're saying is that NFL kickers are just like goalkeepers in soccer.... They're just different. 😜😂 haha
@JawuanJames70 USA or Nantes? Or both? Haha. I got you bro and you give me your Fins jersey in exchange. 👍
Cool to see guys in NFL like @JawuanJames70 &amp; @OBJ_3 take a page from soccer &amp; exchange jerseys after game. How long until NFL has TIFOs?
@NinthVirtue well I guess you really admire parity. Yes America is different but all major sports in the states are like monopolies.
@Diskerudinho thank you. Some people seem to think there's no logic to my reasoning haha
@NinthVirtue well Barcelona, Atletico, Sevilla, Valencia &amp; Villarreal just a few teams that have fair chances by playing same teams equally.
@JozyAltidore guess I have to update my software to see what that box with a question mark is. Make that hotline bling if you win. Lol #6ix
@DaxMcCarty11 you and @SachaKljestan should get everyone to grow awesome filthy Playoff mustaches! 👨🏼👨🏻haha
I also wish you guys best of luck!😜 I will stay up to watch a Toronto v RBNY playoff game to get to MLS Cup final. https://t.co/nVwvxOXVyN
@DaxMcCarty11 congrats man. Hope you guys also win the MLS Cup. Best of luck to you guys in the playoffs.
@SubahAhmed did I question their work ethic? RBNY are good. I can't have opinion on facts that RBNY played weaker teams more often than FCD?
@BBegley1 @MLSTransfers right, because you're so smart &amp; only one with logic. MLS is run by NFL people. I'll just say that I disagree w/ you
@TheVipersNest oh I get that. I'm just saying it's not really a 'fair' trophy when some teams play weaker opponents more often &amp; at home.
@BBegley1 ummm geography? There are 20 teams &amp; teams travel cross country all the time. It's possible.
Congrats RBNY but still don't understand Supporters Shield significance with unbalanced schedules. It's about getting to playoffs &amp; MLS Cup.
It's a-me Mario!!.... And Peach &amp; Toad. We'll kick your butt in Mario Kart! #Wahoo #AWaWaWaWaWaWa #HalloweenInFrance https://t.co/bwNVjScH3U

@sryan03 don't forget about Where Are U Now! ;)
@darrenrovell so sort of like when I did this for our World Cup team!? 😜 https://t.co/ePEb8rHM2p Cc: @JimSias @JohnnieWalkerUS
@JustinWK I get that. Here sentiment is more that EVERYONE should be able to attend games. In USA, more about whole entertainment package.
@ChiTownSpurs did you read my tweet that followed that one?.... ;)
@cptnmarv oh I know. Which is even more of a reason that makes it harder to sympathize with Europeans concerning ticket prices.
So, considering that in Europe people get to watch, at least, 10 more home games than in NFL, I as an American see it as a relative bargain.
If I were to compare the major sports Football(soccer) vs NFL, avg. cheapest season tickets are $300 vs. $500(my own guesstimates.)
As an American, I know it's hard for Americans to sympathize with Europeans about prices to sporting events because it's the norm for us.
These articles lead me to an interesting debate that's ongoing since I've been in Europe. Fans are always complaining about ticket prices.
Always cool to see an @MLS feature coming from a French/European perspective as growth continues. From @Surface_Mag https://t.co/b5DFIUprKj
@AJFrancis410 what about some sweet plantains!??.. ;)
Does English media still think Martial was a panic buy?
This is a really expensive match tonight! #PSGREAL   Champions League time. Doesn't get much better.
Champions League!
@ErikHammill of course! Let me know and I'll get you tickets to a game.
@BStamman @kteneyck16 you also forget that I also went to school, worked hard, and got my BBA degree.
@patchsmith21 wait, what? When did I say that. I've said how I am a proud graduate of BC &amp; that school is amazing! I was generally speaking.
@joevirg7 @STAhighschool I am very grateful to have attended Saint Thomas!
@TheBoudicca @RobMcDoogie well I do! ;)
@jayshreemahtani you can also do that in 'real life' experiences.
@NotInThe18 Hahha got me grammar police.. Stupid autocorrect lol
Why? Because of a piece of paper. Let me remind you of the many out there happily independent &amp; successful w/o one. https://t.co/0IhSUQkokl
Also true, but my point's also that many use very little of what they learn in college in their actual career. https://t.co/Z4eGIKLj5I
Good healthy convo nonetheless, thanks. I think we can agree college isn't for everyone &amp; education needs improvement &amp; be more affordable.
@srlong90 but you do realize that I also went to school and got my degree. And how many, after getting a degree, still struggle for a job?
@Zok82 and I will also assume that many firms like yours also rely on their networks &amp; relationships. Talent isn't always based on a resumé.
Agree 100%. However, for many in their college experience, they didn't really learn anything useful on top of debt. https://t.co/wXt3B5KX3B
@destroyideas correct. And there is something to be said about our system of education! Education also starts at home.
A degree might help ‘open the door,’ but your talent, ability to learn, and work ethic are what keep you ‘in the room.’ #RealWorld
@kyleseiwert that's why I said doctors or lawyers... Should've said medical field
With cost of colleges, it's hard to see true value of that education. Especially when you've been conditioned to not think outside the box.
Don't get me wrong, I'm damn proud of my Bachelor of Business Administration from Boston College but college education is becoming obsolete.
Curious question.  Unless you want to become a doctor or a lawyer, are college degrees really necessary nowadays to become "successful?"

Assholes will be assholes &amp; criminals will be criminals.   I've been in Europe long enough to see less access to guns=less gun violence.
@LonestarV ok I get it. You're from Texas. You probably also think more guns is the answer? Like reporter should've had 1 to defend herself.

US is full of great grass pitches, yet we play on fields that decrease quality of play, slow down speed of play &amp; increase risk of injury...

@RangersFC get in there Waldo!!
Ligue 1 season starts tonight!  Our season starts tomorrow night in a derby v. Guingamp! Allez @FCNantes! http://t.co/uj1fYAE0GE
Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is shown.  Betrayal of any of those is to lose all 3!  #LessonLearned
May the best Viking win!  Good luck to my former coach Åge Hareide &amp; former teammate Nikola Djurdjic!  https://t.co/dbhPoSFLeD
@RevTomDotCom oh yea haha... That's a great look man! 😂😂😂
How could I ever forget about the sweet Valderrama wigs we used to wear at the games &amp; around the house!! 🙈👱😂😂 https://t.co/UDuJZHgl88
@MLSAnalyst @TheDailyShow @Soccerwriter some good reading! Thanks for sharing.
Last of Jon Stewart on @TheDailyShow. Can't forget when he gave me POTY award at NSCAA banquet &amp; speech. #SoccerLove http://t.co/lnQhE9rZ17
Well with your definition I'd say Barcelona-Real Madrid. But I was referring more to atmosphere. Passion &amp; history. https://t.co/VpF8P0FhCx
I'm not saying I disagree, but I'm sure many would say a River-Boca SuperClásico is the best, fiercest derby game! https://t.co/o0TRZX4LTr
And if you're a sports fan, an atmosphere doesn't get much better than the one in the River Plate stadium last night. http://t.co/6qpPVQfGSB
And this explains why sports, specifically soccer, are so subjective. What's does a league/team MVP mean to you? https://t.co/PRgD0ZuWdJ
Damn, Toronto has Giovinco #ChargedUp!! He wasn't voted in the "Best XI" at All-Star game but surely there's no doubts now about being MVP!!
@HeathGPearce yea man people were saying the same as you. They are struggling now but GBG looking good!.. Hope you're well bro
Work hard, play harder! Great catching up.  https://t.co/havtP1BvDP
@latiumartists @TheDannyMercer @juanes @MSTheater wow that's awesome Danny!! Buena suerte parcero!!
@shinguardian but we also know that sports ownership is all about franchise values. New TV deals, sponsorships=rise in each MLS teams worth.
Watching the #MLSAllStar game and hoping to see my friends &amp; teammates do well. Relax people, this one is just a game! ;) #DontGetHurt
Drake out here not playing around. Remember when he was just messing around &amp; ended up making a hit!? Haha  http://t.co/EKtiQgffLt
Never too high, never too low. Thanks to all the fans for their support throughout the USA.
@nbsmallerbear was great to meet you when I went to visit STA!  Keep working hard &amp; I have no doubts I'll be watching you play on Sundays!
We have all been CONCACA F'ed.  Que verguenza. Embarrasing for the 'beautiful game.'
Great to see former teammate @GiuseppeRossi22 back playing &amp; getting a goal v. PSG in this friendly in front of his hometown crowd! #Clifton
Watching this #KnockKnock show &amp; wondering who I would nominate or want to have knock on my door!  Who would you want to knock on your door?
Visited the #WorldofCocaCola this afternoon. Everyone should share a Coke &amp; spread some happiness! Do it! #TeamNike http://t.co/cIpiIqtOyQ
@herculezg haha you're not wrong bro! Twitter can be the best thing or the worst! Lol
What's your passion? Sharing my sisters new post about one of our dreams turning into reality soon! Check it out! https://t.co/KfhNEpBMAd
Training session done &amp; now back to hotel to catch the end of #TheOpen2015! Who will win it!?
Consistency is what we ask for. I don't get a call on a clear foul v. Panama but a very soft call is given in extra time of extra time!?
People think I was having a go at Mexico. No, if it would've happened to another team I would've said the same. It's about being objective..
@marccrosas si, ese si esta loco. Por lo menos estamos de acuerdo! :) Saludos y buena noche.
Soccer is an emotional sport with lots of passion. Good to see people agree that all humans make mistakes. Life goes on. Onto the next game.
Unbelievable. Disgraceful. All you can do is laugh. What. A. Joke.
It's been real... hot Baltimore. Heading to Atlanta with the squad! No pun intended lol. #USMNT #USA #GoldCup2015 http://t.co/Nvs6y1h1Ft

@justinbanta too bad I wasn't trying to impress anyone. It's part of my rehab program to get back in shape. Keep it moving. 💤😴
@idmckenzie17 my workout was just over 5 miles in 34 minutes
This is why I'll share some of my workouts. People have asked. Let me see all my athletes give it a try!🏃 #workhard https://t.co/a9QjiedYmB

@mosamba my man! I'm down in Miami bro. Where you at? How you been?
Only in Florida can you find some of the strangest breaking news stories!  Find this ass &amp; put his butt in jail. http://t.co/qr1qSH2jnK
Good training session &amp; nice seeing my man @juanmata8! Great player &amp; person.  Buena suerte en la nueva temporada! http://t.co/qMXrf8OB3Q

And @_JulieJohnston_ has been a strong wall back there!  https://t.co/GyUuVM99Fs
Wow what a way to lose for SKC &amp; what a way to win for RSL! Cruel &amp; great ending to game which was very entertaining! Glad I stayed up. #MLS
@ArnoldcommaJon lol there's nothing wrong with that. I got friends who have the same and just think it's funny.
Just don't get how they'll sign random foreign DP's with a dull resume &amp; low-ball American/USMNT players. https://t.co/l6MYrIi2bZ
So this guy with 2 first names, Sebastian Jaime, was signed as a DP last year and just scored his first goal for RSL?.... #MLS
If the Andrea Pirlo rumors to NYCFC come true, I know @MixDiskerud will be over the moon but very jealous of his hair!...😂 Cc: @GeoffCameron

Great to be able to train with my former club Weston FC. Some great talent here! #TheFuture https://t.co/SMZABqpELq

@JimSias hate to admit this but it causes me to have a bit of road rage &amp; honk the horn for a few seconds. Also, add a long finger haha
@kian_hansen2 @Feraristeguieta haha no way. I made an offer 15 minutes before kickoff. He had his chance to accept! Always easier after!
😂😂it's 2015 bro! That's worst excuse ever! And anyone that knows you knows you're addicted to your phone! Sorry. https://t.co/ti6G6cKfcv
Hey @Feraristeguieta! I gave you a chance at a great bet but guess you were too scared to accept my deal!? Unlucky, should've taken the bet.
Hey @Vizcarrondo4, wake your teammate up!😴💤 National anthem is playing &amp; game vs Colombia!  Vamos Colombia papa! :) http://t.co/31AC4aEXmY
If Colombia wins you have to tweet picture of you with Colombia jersey! If Venezuela wins, I'll shave my head! Deal? https://t.co/dQ8lOvbc6O
@JeremyPond @AndrewDasNYT fair. I wouldn't say it's VERY quiet, but yea for 'American' sports. WC shouldn't have rest days in group stages.
@JeremyPond @AndrewDasNYT fair. I wouldn't say it's VERY quiet, but yea for 'American' sports. WC shouldn't have rest days in group stages.
@JeremyPond @AndrewDasNYT if very quiet you mean Copa America, Euro qualifiers, &amp; NBA finals game then yea maybe.... ;)

Always on the grind whether it's offseason or not. When the going gets tough, the tough get going! 💪👊 http://t.co/Jmnr6ZSqrP
@GrantWahl me too! Always gets to me that people can't differentiate between Colombia the country &amp; Columbia the university &amp; sports brand
Not sure many are watching Guatemala-Bermuda game but this surely is a match fixed one! 3 goals wrongly denied &amp; now lights went off! #FIFA
I feel like I'm walking through the aisles of IKEA.... I need some of the Swedish music DJs to get things going! Come on #USWNT let's goooo!
Well guess what. I can make opinions, I don't conform to society's expectations, &amp; I don't care for others' approval https://t.co/CM501bRLcv
@JoshHo8 dude please tell me where I said that!?.. I'm referring to media &amp; people in general! CJ has helped a lot esp. in LGBT community.
I don't care for people's prejudices and that is why I'm a happy person!
Regarding last tweet, I'm not for or against anyone or thing.  I'm pointing out the double standards &amp; hypocrisy that exist &amp; will continue.
So a man turns into a woman &amp; is praised around country but a woman changes her race &amp; tries to help that race only to be called a liar!?...
Love being back home &amp; waking up to a Colombian breakfast with arepas &amp; 4 Generations of my family! #familytime http://t.co/HUYSZC2Xdi
Landed in NYC and cleared customs. Officially back in the USA! First stop, I made sure to get some Shake Shack! Soooooo good.

Cool to see the #NBA borrowing a page from soccer/football.  And by the way, America, this is called a #TIFO! http://t.co/oDQ0XOU9GQ
I'll never forget scoring this GOAL vs. PSG in Paris at Parc des Princes.  Was a goal to remember for me. #BangBang  https://t.co/RW3oudpJn4

When trying to blow bubbles too hard goes wrong......😱💨😂😂😂 https://t.co/nE44Cpbti5
Yup, that was a great goal! This #SWE v #NGA game has been the best one so far in #WWC2015. Great end to end action. https://t.co/yJmBZRyJoZ

@rook_js @KhalJeremy @ChiTownSpurs but look at the couple years after Shaq left the Lakers! They weren't good and Kobe couldn't carry them
Everyone wish @alikrieger &amp; the rest of  @ussoccer_wnt good luck during @FIFAWWC! #WeBelieve #1N1T #11 Let's go #USA http://t.co/6CvjetVNmE
There's people like @RealSkipBayless who don't even believe their own thoughts &amp; words. There's haters &amp; then those who hate just to hate.😴💤
So clutch isn't putting team on your back through first 2 games?  If LeBron went 5 for 23 like Curry last night.... https://t.co/2eP7zKEipd
MJ is greatest but could he have won rings without 2 of his all-stars like Rodman &amp; Pippen?... I said if Lebron wins https://t.co/aaiLTPVgmn
I've now woken up twice to see how awesome #NBAFinals have been. If Lebron wins it all with this supporting cast, could that make him GOAT?
B/c I was student-athlete who wanted best of both! I graduated from 1 of best schools &amp; helped team be #1 in nation! https://t.co/8THGzw8BO7
@GrantWahl and part of it is also investment in sport. I'd blame FIFA for not investing enough &amp; disrespecting sport by playing WC on turf!
@GrantWahl fair enough. But I hope we don't continue to see these blowouts in group stages. Quality is how casual viewers will want to watch
@alecko11 agree totally with you and @JeremyPond!
After today's games, one of them not even at halftime yet, why would anyone want the number of #WomensWorldCup teams to expand to 32!?..
What a great game that was which lived up to the finals hype! That second half had me winded.⚽️💨🏃  Barcelona is just too good.
@ESPNSteinLine now that makes rooting for the Warriors even better!
Tiki taka. #Barca!
Can't convince me that there's anything better to watch on TV this weekend than tonight's #UCLfinal between #JuveFCB!   Let's go Barca!
@BeaHilland @PScho42 @GeoffCameron I'm more mature than all three of you! ;)
I can get used to us scoring these late goals instead of conceding them haha.  What an effort by the boys tonight &amp; great result! #USMNT
America!

And so my summer begins:  Nantes➡️ Paris➡️ Copenhagen➡️ Helsingborg➡️ Bergen➡️ Amsterdam➡️ New York➡️ Miami➡️ Los Angeles.  ✈️☀️😎

@jcro it was a great idea for Nike to make them in Men's sizes also! We'll all be rooting for them this summer
Like Every Day.  Me: So where you wanna go eat. Her: I don't care! You pick. Me: Let's go to _____(insert name) Her: Nah, not there. Me: 😱😤😡
@JerseyJBradley does wiffle ball count!?.. That was one of my fave backyard games with friends
First row, front &amp; center, but no popcorn. #TBT to when I had best view of @clint_dempsey goal in World Cup. #USMNT http://t.co/gN08qXNy7R
@TheCalcioGuy @dkarbassiyoon well stay tuned for another long monologue from him once our product in this sector gets kicking off!.... ;)
@MixDiskerud @ATT I'd like to get this for my American phone &amp; not be charged for roaming or always looking for Wifi. Where do I sign up? ;)
@BeaHilland yes it did and stay tuned because there's more to come! 😜
Injuries suck but I'll be back. Surreal to hear fans chant my name to lead #IBelieveThatWeWillWin chant w/ @FCNantes https://t.co/Hjblii6nSA
@iamjamiefoxx killed it on @jimmyfallon last night! So funny &amp; talented. I can't forget @MauriceEdu showing me this: https://t.co/H9e9xuHTKb
That was some TV gold 😂😂🍷🍷🍻#Shhhelsea   If you haven't seen his speech, watch here:  http://t.co/WXLzj8AJcM  https://t.co/0EMkRbMl96
@BostonCollege @WePay @billclerico @RichAberman @galenmoore @danprimack awesome! Good stuff guys and all the best. #BCproud
@A_W_Gordon I do the military salute hand signal. Hand to forehead and "salute" that person. Like a tip of the hat kinda thing haha
@gtw1872 or a flash the lights, honk the horn, and a nice middle finger can work too! ;) haha
Someone not thanking you when holding door open is as annoying as jackass who doesn't raise their hand for letting them cut you in traffic.
@BriBrows22 congrats man. All the best to you and your family. #BCfam
I don't think coach would be too happy if we'd tried this @MixDiskerud! You crazy Norwegians!  Looks fun though haha https://t.co/uMNkrZ1lWP
So proud of my sister!  Looking forward to being a part of this family business project. #ForCoffeeLovers #StayTuned https://t.co/3Biccuohq4
@dkarbassiyoon haha I sent that link to @adamSWOL yesterday! 👍
Not going to lie but that was pretty funny from Fabregas! Incoming missile. 😂😂😂
Whatever it takes to help put on a butt whooping performance! Good stuff bro @BrekShea  https://t.co/IA1KhW05Sh
@SoundersFC @clint_dempsey @RobinsonCano should've got me that throwback Ken Griffey Jr. jersey bro!
@aronjo20 congrats bro!  Sweet bike 🚲⚽️👌
@BrekShea @MauriceEdu I'm still waiting for mine......
Great goal by @JuanAgudelo but never underestimate movement by my boy @CharlieDavies9.  Always want your striker to make that near post run.
Staying up to watch 2 of my boys go at it in #NEvTOR game! #MLS  Let's see who'll be dancing tonight between @JozyAltidore &amp; @CharlieDavies9
@SSFC_Rumors no problem man! Glad you enjoyed it
Apparently someone was bored at tonight's game!  Thanks to the fans that came out for last home game of season! #FCN http://t.co/etulzc1cxl
Legend gets thrown around too often but #Gerrard is one of them! Fantastic career. #YNWA  Remarkably, he kept the same haircut throughout.👱😂
@SoccerByIves soon this world will have people taking selfies from their flying cars a la Jetsons style haha
Wow! This looks real sweet! This thing is badass in that it'll be cool but probably be the start of many complaints https://t.co/qUPs74RL21
Now that's a good looking kit!  Thanks for the support! 👍👌✌️ https://t.co/KHsQ50wEjQ
Wow. What a great statement worth reading. He for sure took more lines than what this statement has. #BigBlow  https://t.co/Fqislda2eR
Must be nice! Maybe one day.... #goals why not!??  https://t.co/CRc5VcQGNc
@SSFC_Rumors should've told me earlier. I'll see what I can do
Can't really say. I've only experienced Old Firm Derby. South American passion is different. Boca-River is intense. https://t.co/kbb8Flzfpg
Crazy scenes in Boca Juniors v River Plate match! Grew up watching this amazing rivalry but this shouldn't be the price to pay for passion.
@JerseyJBradley my Norwegian gf says they have a quote for him in Norway. He's been able to make "gull ut av gråstein." Gold out of rubble.👍
I know I'd be slaughtered if I tried to nutmeg player midfield, lost ball, didn't try to defend &amp; led to lost points https://t.co/Br3b5FRCPF
Just saw #DCvORL highlights. I know he's a class player but did KAKA get called out for giving up that 2nd goal? Or #DoubleStandard
@rgreenha but Barca &gt; Real Madrid ;)
Will be nice to see Xavi v Pirlo in the final. 2 legends!  But, don't think I'm going out on a limb by saying, Congrats Barcelona! #Barca :)
@TheCalcioGuy it's only the same guy you despised at Milan! ;)
@iamdavidaccam @BeaHilland and don't forget about the Colombian part! Little man is going to have some moves!! haha
@EricWynalda couldn't find a better picture!?... Apparently I haven't hit puberty yet. lol #MustacheFail #PeachFuzz
A very proud, cool, great day for me as a father. 😃🇺🇸 https://t.co/r9sLvtDaCN
@Flyguy14 @kylejmccarthy @chrismegaloudis have said it before. It can't be a "league of choice" with this stuff going on.
@T_i_m_o__ I learn something new everyday, Merci
@pinillacristina haha that turned out well. These things could be a pain in the butt but makes it much easier when everyone plays nice.
And during interview process to prove American citizenship, I was asked why we call it soccer &amp; where the word comes from. #TrickQuestion ?😀
In school, I was always told that Wikipedia was not a reliable source to use. Well, today it actually saved my ass at the embassy. 😂
@Schnoodert haha dude like I said, get a sense of humor!!!!! Good night
@Schnoodert no generalizing. Just facts. USA is 1 of most obese countries in world. I'm a proud American &amp; Eagle. Also, get a sense of humor
@Schnoodert anti-American!? Ok buddy. I was a huge fan of Lance Armstrong. But he blew it. And sport of cycling has cheats from all over.
@Schnoodert which ones!?... The ones won with cheaters and liars? #justsaying
In Europe you have to cycle to charge phones. Don't know if this would work in the states. Maybe for eating burgers.😂 http://t.co/Yzn2Mipz5M

This is how I now spend my weekend nights over here. Watching some #MLS action... http://t.co/TN0y2wXLDk
That is so four score and seven years ago..... https://t.co/2VkJwD0kRF
I hope to be back for the last home game of the season next weekend vs. Lorient!  https://t.co/7DMtdljhF4
And what a result right now! Dale Valencia!  Visca el Barca!!   #BarcelonaCampeon
I've been playing with a sore knee for the past 3 weeks!  It was time to take a bit of time off to recover &amp; heal. https://t.co/hXWBetJNG9
It's a shame! People who ran the club have ruined it. Fans deserve a lot better. https://t.co/u1EfWVYHjg
OUI!! 0-1. Allez #FCNantes
My boy @CharlieDavies9 just can't stop scoring! Congrats man. That's just all your hard work paying off bro. #KeepOnDancing
@RFC_Rab @davidgweir class act on and off the pitch! Was a pleasure sharing the same dressing room as Davie!
Was nice to see my old mate @davidgweir getting after it on the touch line.😂 Unlucky tonight. Good luck in return leg http://t.co/7FegMOfQBs
@NBCSports @GeoffCameron #AskGeoff I thought you were a defender!😜 Anyways, why do I always have to wait for you to finish doing your hair?
@MFparkhurst haha.   Ke$ha be like, "it's going down, I'm yelling Timber!"

One Word. Two Syllables.   #MESSI.
HAHAHA at #DeflateGate report! What a joke! I'd actually love to make a joke from it but afraid it may fall flat.... #MoreProbableThanNot
And now feet up on the couch to watch 2 of the best teams in the world go at it! #UCL #BarcaBayern   Visca el Barca!

Happy Birthday to the best sister &amp; aunt ever! Enjoy your bday gifts from @Nike! ;) Here's to the future #JUSTDOIT https://t.co/lFwv0YXFRs
@GrantWahl Madrid is a totally different team with Modric playing so not good that he's injured. Ramos isn't a midfielder.
🍕 + 👧🏻 +✌= WIN!  https://t.co/7glOQv3367
How's that not a Red Card on Carvajal!?... #JuveReal   Last man, clear scoring opportunity..
Well that lasted 30 more seconds after your tweet! 😂😂  Great game so far! Awesome pace &amp; intensity.  https://t.co/FDBiaom6El
"You're too small, not tough enough," they said.  #ForMyHaters  Blessed to be named #ManOfTheMatch vs. team like #PSG http://t.co/3ulGIx79PU
@PedroPaddy wow now that's pretty cool. Congrats on Bournemouth being promoted &amp; Allez FCN
Always a thrilling end to the regular season in the Championship!  Crazy how Derby County missed the playoffs after being in top 6 all year.
What a weekend for sports! One of best ever?  Starts off with Super Saturday. Soccer, NHL, NBA, Kentucky Derby, &amp; #MayweatherPacquiao! 📺💰
@mike_e_mike @mattr1chards0n haha the Bay Area is awesome. And great new looking stadium you guys got! 👍
@PScho42 @BBrudz he's still in Paris haha... Gets in to Nantes tomorrow morning.
Thank you! They act like I hate it. It's OUR league in USA! I speak out where others won't. Things have affected me. https://t.co/i8qv1ISkkH
If you don't like a player speaking his mind w/ dif. perspective, I'm not holding you back from tapping 'unfollow' https://t.co/UGvl0sSjsn
But MLS is supposed to be the League of 'Choice'!?...  Oh PS. They also got Fabian Johnson's current club wrong. 😁 https://t.co/ERBZ4SkrCG
Sending positive vibes only to my former teammate @iamdavidaccam! Great addition to the @MLS!  Keep it up man. https://t.co/NVLccna9zw
New @Surface_Mag has great articles on #MLS! Some good points from interviews w/ @ampC2, Le Toux, &amp; Houllier. #Growth http://t.co/1ua3CHV1EH
@omastrocola22 @RdelgadoNU21 like preseason in Mexico, MLS schedule changes for club, &amp; if Joey Saputo could spend more I'm sure he would
@herculezg right. Before new format. Hard to fit every argument in 140 character tweets haha. Good debates=progress! Hope all is well,Abrazo
@herculezg they did everything to increases chances. However, depth &amp; quality is due to lack of $. Can't have teams be serious w/ MLS sched.
@TaylorTwellman thanks, appreciate it. Good work on salary figs. If every team could spend $ right, in 'free market' it would benefit all.
Ok cool. Let's play this game.   How about the number of players who were at the World Cup by domestic league! https://t.co/5F7BzTXzGj
Name 5 better then. https://t.co/zv8VrMUVJc
@JozyAltidore gracias amigo! I get it isn't simple but change happens by speaking out. Needle didn't move much &amp; it won't for 5+ years
@FBGRamsay @AlexiLalas Ligue 1 is one of the best leagues.. Top 5 in world
@soccercanales do you not see that increase in salary would mean overall expenditure from clubs towards more quality, depth, &amp; youth dev...?
HUH!?.. Montreal had over 60k. Seattle &amp; others have had 60k+ crowds. Avg. attendance has increased significantly. https://t.co/NShX41e2Tq
@RdelgadoNU21 possibly. Can't expect teams play competitive during preseason- don't care much. But Montreal given extra help to succeed....
No MLS team has won the #CCL. That's because MLS league structure prevents its teams from doing so. You have to spend $ for quality &amp; depth.
Montreal had a great run. However, the end result just proves a lot about the terrible new #CBA deal &amp; where MLS stands.
If you want to be one of the best in the world soon, it's safe to say MLS has to first be the best league in the region.
@JeremyPond thanks my man! Speak soon haha
@shinguardian my tech mentor. Thanks a lot man!
Got the best Birthday surprise ever! Family arrived today from the states and whole family is now… https://t.co/Di5l6QKw73
@brad_evans3 Bonjour! Didn't you get the memo...You're supposed to tweet in French! Allez Allez
@MLS oui! C'est génial! Bonne chance à Montréal.
HAHA! This is great. Merci Beaucoup! 👍👌👏 https://t.co/txKky6rfb3
Hey @MixDiskerud!  Can me &amp; @GeoffCameron join your competition w/ an old video?   (We should win b/c it's my BDAY!)😜 http://t.co/oy6lbsMh4N
Thanks my man! Some good memories there with #HIF.. Keep up the good work in MLS with Chicago!  https://t.co/6TcQ68lVSe

Muchas Gracias parcero!! See you this summer in Miami!  https://t.co/U8nGnYJtFO
@juanfutbol @dens @foursquare this jersey definitely belongs on the pitches (and beaches) of Miami! ;)
I can't wait for the Entourage movie this summer. Check out this short video of Johnny Drama for @JohnnieWalkerUS!   http://t.co/O7JQagIbPb
I wish I could stay up to watch the fight but I have to be ready for a different kind of fight.... against #PSG!👊⚽️💪 https://t.co/vfZOWqwUhl
My man @BrekShea! Great read. Brek is Brek &amp; I am me. We're not robots!! I love what I do, I do what I love.  https://t.co/E9SXDDEUCo
I keep trying to tell my club that a preseason in USA would be amazing! Haha.. 😜😎🇺🇸 https://t.co/YZ67ESzQp2
@GrantWahl presumably. We're talking opaque stuff here. USSF &amp; MLS involved. Safe to say Relevant Sports promotes it &amp; SUM involved some way
@GrantWahl how much $ does SUM and MLS make off of this? ;)
@phillytim333 haha. Whatever works is right!
Speaking of annoying things, it's amazing how a sound that drives me nuts can make my baby calm &amp; go to sleep. #WhiteNoise
@Shea_LC I think it's safe to say that chicks have that whole "sobbing until you get your own way" pretty much down. Haha
I tried that already &amp; even swear words I knew in 4 different languages haha... Any other tips? https://t.co/Qa37RHdmeI
I can't even talk to someone at the U.S. Embassy here in France. I pay taxes for government services like this....😡 https://t.co/pfYlBd0o7w

Nice pic from my GOAL last night! Snuck back post to head it in. Important point for us #FCN https://t.co/ZHTWs76Z0r http://t.co/RhE26RhmRR
@Sscrew49 ahhh ok merci!! I will be back in the USA though :/
Can't believe I just found out @madeon is from Nantes. Love his music &amp; You're On is an awesome song!  Quand va tu venir a La Beaujoire?
There are never easy games! 1 point is better than 0.  Happy to score another goal but I hope we can finish the season off strong! Allez FCN
1 point c'est toujours mieux que rien!  Content pour mon but mais on espère finir la saison fort! 💪👊 Merci pour votre soutien! #FCN
Congrats to former teammate @iamdavidaccam in opening MLS scoring account! Happy for you.  A player to watch out for! #Roadrunner #beepbeep
@JanuszESPN so am I one of those "whippersnappers" you're talking about? Are you just content with having MLS? Not willing to push for more?
@A_W_Gordon @GrantWahl I appreciate the feedback! I think it's important for players to speak out. Debate is always start to better things.
@GeoffCameron @santibedoya89 hahaha remember all that advice you ask from me when we are roommates??... #Bahhhhston
Thanks Grant! Eventually, I'll be able to put my @BostonCollege business school degree to good use. ;) #CSOM https://t.co/3SXHBCXIJg
@datvance b/c I'm American &amp; am hopeful MLS will be a sustainable league/one of best. It's where my friends play &amp; my son can play in future
@djchubakka well me too. If you read my other tweets I stated how growth in revenue is not shared amongst the players! Spend⬆️=Quality⬆️
@djchubakka you're assuming they make little or no money. Franchises appreciate in value over time which makes it successful business plan.
6. And as a fan of the league, I hope it continues to grow like it has &amp; becomes one of the best. But, like with everything, debate helps.
5. With MLS franchises more valuable there is significant growth in revenue. Problem is, that revenue is not shared amongst the players.#CBA
4. Once MLS expansion eventually stops, the values of the franchises will go up. Owners make money back when they'd sell their team.
3. Fact is owners don't mind operating at a loss. Their investment is buying a team with long term vision that it will appreciate in value.
2. Even though many sports teams are 'operating at a loss', I believe it to be an illusion so owners/league can use tax laws in their favor.
1. A lot of noise has been made recently with the latest analysis of the MLS business model by @sszy &amp; in which he made a bold statement.
@BillyCorben @AJFrancis410 @MiamiDolphins @Uber_Miami 5 stars if he gets out of the car to open the door!!.. 😜haha
@AJFrancis410 @BillyCorben @MiamiDolphins @Uber_Miami I know who I'll be calling for a ride when I get back home over the summer! ;)
A cool F'n dad! Normal is boring &amp; life is all about having fun! My son will probably wear a helmet 24 hours a day😂 https://t.co/PLMVtSTMyi
@trevor_brady rules are meant to be broken ;) haha. No but in all seriousness  common sense could be used for certain situations...
@BabbittCGroup @SoccerInsider @CharlieDavies9 boooohooooo... It shows different personalities which helps the league &amp; makes sponsors happy
Credit where credit is due! That Scott Gallagher team was good. Was a great game that went to Double Overtime! 👍 https://t.co/u5thIlP7cm
Why!?... Trying to be like the NFL "No Fun League" https://t.co/miDdqsCHN7
@JimSias let's do it! Why not? Some good marketing &amp; I think it could sell! 👍Lots of bikers/cyclists would go for them! 😂
@shinguardian Many assumptions. I'm sure there are lots of revenue streams missing as well. SUM, local TV, merchandise sales &amp; BS for CBA ;)
@OriginalWinger well they say any publicity is good publicity and it seems it worked out for them. #SoccerIsHereToStay
Oh the memories!! Good old days. #WhereItAllStarted And what a team we had! #TikiTaka  https://t.co/hgXeIFd4hF
@HeathGPearce if only that was the case! I was cruising around in my club car! #LoveATeamSponsor
@SayNo2ProRel I'm sure if Impact played that way throughout regular season they'd have finished better last yr &amp; have more than 2 points now
Schools here are on vacation which means hundreds of fans wait outside training ground... Strangest request: To take a selfie inside my car
@santibedoya89 hope it was worth it to stay up late haha... Now wake your butt up &amp; get ready! I'm starving &amp; am ready for lunch!
How did worst team in MLS get that great result down in Azteca!? Amazing what happens when you play a game that means something #Intense
Chicharito gets his goal! Pure striker. Has created chances all game w/ his movement &amp; able to keep his head up &amp; know he would get another!
@darrenrovell got to love the cross-marketing that includes Nike and Wilson.
@KICKTV so that's what the socks would have looked like with grass stains if it were played on real grass!!?.. ;) #FTurf
Beautiful day at the park.  Perfect for me to dominate you Danish people at your own game!! 😝😜👍💪👊 https://t.co/ZWp9oZaZZz
Perfect for the summer haha! Looks good! 👍👌 https://t.co/BdXi4s43LQ
@JimSias thanks my man. It's all about giving back #fanappreciation
@gimmemore315 Hahha well he does have better handwriting that I do! 😜

@dens do they still sell that magic potion I could drink &amp; try my luck haha. Cool video &amp; very inspiring.
@AmericanRed10 @MostonRedDevil and people like him are exactly what I mean!.... Stats aren't everything in football #seethewholegame
Don't understand how people doubted Bayern!  And even worse is people who questioned Iniesta's play by showing his stats this season! #Class
Just getting home from dinner.   Did I miss anything in these #ChampionsLeague games!?..... 😳😱
@thejonlane the Heat have been way more relevant since they came into the NBA... please don't tell me your a Magic fan. If so, sorry ;)
@shinguardian haha well at least the Warriors are relevant again... ;) #TheBayAreInThePlayoffs @HeathGPearce ;)
Huge thanks to @sean_dennis for the baby care package! A new young addition to the @MiamiHEAT family.Cc: @MickyArison http://t.co/yeU33t0tqT

Already loving the start to these #NBAPlayoffs!  Just caught up on some highlights.  Who you got making it to the finals? Warriors v Hawks?
So someone doesn't know how to take a joke.  Congrats, you're a disgrace &amp; your mom must be so proud of you. https://t.co/lyXlHVw9kZ
NON!! On a gagné 1-0 contre Marseille! Au revoir a le titre! Ce dommage. 👋 https://t.co/5bDjbH1Wlf
My man @CharlieDavies9 was probably under a lot of pressure to score that goal from his wife! Haha  Great goal &amp; celebration bro!
@JustHeatherWeir thanks!.. Amazing feeling haha.. Hope all is well with you and Jamie! Best wishes to your family
@JuanPaGalavis @herculezg hahaha. And when I brought him down he started crying! So had to lift him up again until my arms went sore!
What better way to celebrate Santino's 1 month young birthday today than reenact a scene from #TheLionKing! 😂😂👶🏼👶🏼 http://t.co/hJsYDeJrn8
@hbaf214 take some shots for me! Would've loved to come kick it with fellow Americans but I have family over right now. Enjoy. Have a good 1
@WillMcD @dens @KICKTV sounds good. I'll be sure to try and make a great trip to NYC this offseason haha
@ATLCapitalGroup @FCNantes appreciate the support! Thanks for showing up and hope you enjoy the sweaty jersey! Haha
Great win tonight v. Marseille in front of our awesome fans!  What an atmosphere! Allez #FCN  Got to love playing under #FridayNightLights
Quelle Match!! Beau soir et très belle ambiance!!   Grand victoire de tout l'équipe. Merci pour votre soutien! #FCN #Nantes
@dens @foursquare @jcro @jackosborne @sambrown @msingleton Sweet deal. I'll take you up on that, thanks. Keep up great work, love the app.👍
@jcro @dens @foursquare now that's a company culture I'd like to be a part of! Sounds like a great atmosphere.
One day, MLS will be 1 of best leagues! Articles like the one today in French paper L'Équipe prove growth &amp; interest. http://t.co/zirgzGpehD
Awesome to see the growth of soccer in the states!   Even better to see some of Tech worlds's biggest hitters support the game. @dens #USMNT
@OBJ_3 dope picture bro! Guy is a legend! Let's hope he gets his team in Miami! 👍👌
This mornings coffee tastes better seeing the #DosACero result!  It's not a dream @JmoSmooth13. Wake up so you don't miss class @ Stanford!😝
Hope I wake up tomorrow to a win v. Mexico. Another possible #DosACero!?   Let's get that W boys!! Good luck to the #USMNT tonight. #1N1T
@courtemancheMLS @OriginalWinger @chriskamrani great advice! Gotta have confidence &amp; belief in self to fake it until you make it! Congrats.👍
@_joelramos_ not bothered. I speak from a players' perspective. At the end of the day we are all fans who see growth of league differently.
@EddiePitch Eddie, MLS needs more fans like you. But trust me when I say that I probably say what most of the players in the league think.
@chatmls @SoccerInsider @MLS why not? I'm a fan of the league. But just like I can be criticized as a player, well so can a league/business
You're right. I hate soccer!😂 And I do watch my friends &amp; teammates play every week...Unless there's a bye week....💤 https://t.co/fsSjd3aguG
@soccercanales fair enough. But that's MLS parity for you. Reg. season isn't as intense as it could be since 12 of 20 teams make playoffs.
@EddiePitch @Joshuahss @soccercanales @SoccerInsider coming from same guy who says I'm unpatriotic! I'm an MLS fan but it can be criticized.
Can someone help this guy out!... How is it fun to watch that game when half of the starters are away on Int'l. duty https://t.co/q9wpQSqa4n
@SoccerInsider but they can't change games to accommodate FIFA dates!?....
@GGS80 papers are a joke... Anything to sell. Who gives a damn what people do outside of football in their personal lives
@ussoccer @BrekShea Going for the Beckham or girl next door just got out of the shower look!?...
@Ross81UK I still have trouble understanding that Glasgow accent haha
Do people really write Twitter the way they pronounce it!?...   Twidda in a British accent &amp; Tuiter in Español?
Guilty since college. Groceries have also become more expensive. Plus the options of eating out &amp; pampered feeling. https://t.co/D5VKukYpH7
@Lakers @dkarbassiyoon @veezy_SQ get this NBA Arsenal fan to the Miami Heat! lol
@FrederikkeEmily your pale man @kian_hansen2 needs some of this sun!... And you! 😝😎
Summer vibes right now!  Out on the balcony, sun shining, people watching along the river &amp; music blasting! 👍👌😎
@BeaHilland sorry we're not sorry! ;)
@AndrewLightle and not towards a greater increase in salary cap or adding another DP slot.
All these big new deals &amp; sponsorships keep coming in lately! I wonder who's pockets this money is going into.... #MLS
@dacerbo appreciate the support! 🙌
@D6MERIT wait until you see Chory Castro's goal for Real Sociedad!
Journalists are funny. Few weeks ago they said PSG are better without Zlatan. Tonight they're starting to say PSG will struggle without him.
@Pi3rre_Alain @BeaHilland haha you have French arrogance in your profile. I assume that means you are #JeSuisCharlie when you want!...
.@stuholden Is Google a man or a woman?  A woman because it won't let you finish a sentence without making a suggestion. #FunJokeFriday
@JimSias yes I am! :)... Thanks a lot. Looking forward to catching up once in back in the states! 👍
To be quite frank, Frank Deford just proved there's progress in America! We've gone from Americans hate soccer to just hating MLS. #Dinosaur
@JimSias you mean they're not your own opinions on Diageo alcohol beverages!?.. Surely there's a difference 😂
@ScottUrb I can't complain too much because my girlfriend has to deal with it a lot worse haha
@PScho42 haha just in time for the opening of our cafe! I'll know what real coffee should taste like
I now know why people say they sleep like a baby....  Because they obviously don't have a baby! 👶😮💤☕️
Never been happier to score a goal. This GOAL is for you, Santino.👶❤️ Thanks guys for making my celebration special! http://t.co/xtOa7dVj3e
@TBoyd91 thanks bro! Not a happy guy though after losing the game.... Hope you're well and get back soon!
@GrantWahl @BeaHilland thanks Grant, much appreciated. Hopefully, one day you'll be criticizing &amp; praising my little boy! ;)
@BeaHilland you complain about too much soccer when I'm there but then you still watch it when I'm gone.... #IDontGetIt 😂😂
@JimSias @BocaBoca3 I'll help you translate it next time in person over a nice glass of Johnnie on the rocks!.. ;)
“@BocaBoca3: Allez les rouge et noir. Bon chance http://t.co/S3LZ36KPng”  Quoi!?... J'ai sais que tu préfères les jaunes et verts!  😉😁😜
Charlie Adam must win those half field crossbar challenges all the time.  That goal was like hitting the green in golf on a Par 5! #Swinggg
Charlie Adam!.... You could have a career as an NFL player also with that strike!
What a great first half in #Arsenal #Liverpool game!! 3-0 Gunners!  I wonder if @piersmorgan is still shouting, Wenger out!!?.... 🙉💤
Feel so blessed in life to have done 35 of these 50 things before the age of 30! #BucketList   How about you guys!?  http://t.co/bNVTksa0MQ

@EricWynalda @shinguardian I also probably wouldn't make that Amazing 98' World Cup team w/ half of same team from 94'!?..... Oh wait.......

@ESPNSteinLine sad day! @SteveNash along with Jason Kidd were my favorite players growing up! Class guy who loves soccer! :) Best of luck.
I wonder how Messi would do in EPL?  "He wouldn't have as much impact in England because La Liga isn't as 'competitive'"😂😂😂  #BestPlayerEver
@ZoSamaniego I was always told the world works around networking.... ;)
So hard to get in touch with the @USEmbassyFrance!  I wonder if a fellow Boston College alumni, @USAmbFrance, could help me out... :)
@USAmbFrance Bonjour! Not only are we US Citizens but we're both also graduates of @BostonCollege.   I'm living in France &amp; need your help.
“@GrantWahl: @AleBedoya17 Ligue 1 doing the deed in CL... again.”   Good year for Ligue 1 this season. The title race also down to the wire!

Huge congrats to AS Monaco for moving onto the next round in Champions League!  The French Ligue 1 isn't that bad after all ehhhh!?.. ;)
WOW! Talk about a nail biting, gut wrenching game that was haha.
Birds chirping, flowers blossoming, sun shining, &amp; clear blue skies. Spring is finally here!  En plein soleil! Printemps est arrivé.    ☀️😎👌

@NetsJetsfan549 @ESPNSteinLine @Henry2Live it's OK for today...but starting tomorrow when fantasy playoffs begin, I need all fresh!
@ESPNSteinLine as long as Westbrook, Klay Thompson, Ty Lawson &amp; Kevin Love don't rest or get injured &amp; put up numbers I'll be OK :)
Great goal by David Villa!  Would've loved to seen him run &amp; slide to home plate at Yankee Stadium as a celebration! #NYCFC
@PScho42 back to middle and high school days stomping in our Air Force 1s
Just kickin' it today on a great Spring day! Fresh new #Nike Lunar Force 1 High.  #WeekendKicks… https://t.co/uShxrDpiZX
@BeaHilland I guess it must be those declining oil prices that they would rather play in Sweden than go back to Norway!?....
3 points is all that matters! Great win tonight.  Merci au le supporters pour votre soutien!   #FCN ne lâche rien! 💪👊

“@DanMeder: @AleBedoya17 MLS pays in American dollars ;)”  Haha yeah I'll have to keep my €uros in bank a little longer before converting ;)
Not sure how I feel about the stronger Dollar vs weaker Euro! 😏Good &amp; bad.   #MixedFeelings
@willblackmon @JaredDudley619 @ProFootballTalk congrats bro! Gotta check out my boys @clint_dempsey &amp; @brad_evans3 at Sounders games!👍
@stuholden haha some people just don't get...Got to let them know.  If you can't take it, don't dish it out. #simple
What I learned tonight:  1)Tweet abuse/insult at athlete  2)Athlete responds &amp; person gets sensitive or I'm not professional!?  #CryMeARiver
“@ElNino_Mohamed: @AleBedoya17 enjoy Nantes because you'll never see champions league football”  Hope you enjoyed WATCHING the World Cup....
“@ElNino_Mohamed: @AleBedoya17 fuck off you bus stop wanker!”  LOL. Me bus stop wanker!?  Some1 tell this Chelsea fan--Man City owns NYCFC!😂
“@jnordbrock9: @AleBedoya17 won? It was 2-2... Should they both go to Paris now &amp; play 30 more minutes?”  Play in Paris,man down! Game over!
@Jmeyerhead no I won't give it a rest.. You're up a man at home. Play football,attack &amp; kill the game! Sit back and get what they deserved.
@TengoLecheFC @ldumia hahaha couldn't have said it better myself! Thanks... Over the 2 legs PSG were better.
“@Jmeyerhead: @AleBedoya17 FUCK OFF”  Hahahaha! Well you're bio is right, you angry sports fan!!  You were up a man most of match at home!
What a game! Congrats to PSG!  Well deserved to go through over the 2 legs! Real football won!
@shinguardian if you don't get stuck in you're not as passionate/competitive. A hard tackle is applauded more than a defense splitting pass.
@shinguardian well then you haven't seen or played in Scotland....
That tackle from Diego Costa was worse than Zlatans!!!  What a joke this ref is!
And of course the ref doesn't give the penalty!!   It's a make up call for the red card.   #RuinedTheGame
@MDel_22 well that's a makeup call for the red card! See how the ref has now become the main guy!
That was never a red card!   Shame a ref has to become the protagonist in a great big game!
What. A. Game! Some awesome stuff from Schalke at the Bernabéu against Real Madrid!
Not only is he from the same city(Bergen,Norway) as my girl @BeaHilland, he's also got a summer hit! @KygoMusic song 'Firestone' is 🔥👍👌
“@JozyAltidore: Caption this.. Lol http://t.co/oOOcRzpWPz”  "Why you gotta be so rude!? I'm gonna marry her anyway!"🎤🎧🎵

@ryandeandempsey hope you're well boss! Looking forward to your bro tearing it up tonight &amp; this year! All the best and see you soon! 👍
@ryandeandempsey hahaha and sound like they have a British accent!?...
“@RVINCENTG: “@OrlandoCitySC: #FilledTheBowl http://t.co/eFePnoq1Uv” okkkkkk @AleBedoya17”  Awesome to see soccer back in Florida!! 👍👌👏
Good half from Orlando! Kaka still class! David Villa is on an island all by himself.   Can't imagine playing on that turf in the summer!😱
@FrederikkeEmily @BeaHilland well if you're into sports, this is what Sunday's are for!
Thanks to new Eurosport deal, I'm looking forward to watching lots of #MLS games!! First up, Orlando vs NYCFC. All about Kaka!
“@torontofc: Everyone, meet @JozyAltidore's troll face.#COYR http://t.co/ViCfcvMHsI”  Great pic! Just the type of girl mom wants to meet...😂
@MLSGabor @MLS now we just need a team down in South Florida. Miami preferably! ;)
“@ESPNWondo: @AleBedoya17 who was your favorite player when you were growing up?”  Zidane &amp; Ronaldo
“@allanwiggins5: @AleBedoya17 Expected more from him in World Cup very disappointing.”  He scored 4 goals &amp; created most chances....
“@TheCalcioGuy: @AleBedoya17 But can Messi do it in a cold, windy night in Stoke? ;)”   Haha if Luis Suarez can, I'm sure Messi would also!
Will never understand the EPL peeps who say Messi plays in weak league &amp; hasn't proven himself in England to be the best!😂🙈😂😴
Barcelona back to the top of the table where they belong!! Messi brilliant.
@AJFrancis410 congrats bro! All the best #FinsUp
@shinguardian isn't it also fitting that the new Eurosport TV rights deal &amp; Audi sponsorship deal were announced after CBA agreement...
@DaxMcCarty11 Ginja Ninja!!!... Ohhhhhh yeeeeee!! Congrats man
@GoldieMikeyx it's all good my man! I appreciate the support! That's what counts. :)
“@BeaHilland:15 degrees today! Guess players are happy they won't freeze their .. off anymore #soccer will always be a #balls challenge”⚽️⚽️
@CURRCL well in MLS the MLS cup is what matters right!?... They've kind of built a little dynasty over the last years..
Good luck to my friends &amp; teammates on their season as the #MLS kicks off this weekend! #OpeningWeekend   Will @LAGalaxy win it... Again?
@anthonyanta play in another World Cup.
@DemotionAntonym well even if that does happen you still have to pay for those rights to air them online whether it's UniMas, ESPN3 etc.
.@TheStevenWillis I'm talking now! Cash from expansion teams, $ spent on DPs, new TV deal, 60k attendance figs, new sponsors...Players caved
@TaylorTwellman @darrenrovell what will players' leverage be when next CBA negotiations come around??... No new TV deal until 3 years after.
@EddiePitch I'm blessed to play soccer for a living which I've worked hard for &amp; sacrificed a lot. Does your "career" last max. 10 yrs?...
@TheRealWamiq appreciate it! I'm as big of an MLS fan as the next person(like you). Goal still for it to be a top league by 2022, right? ;)
@TheRealWamiq so ~275K increase in cap/yr.. Not much for mid tier players who increase quality...pay for low tier who outperform contract?..
Bad deal for middle tier players who help grow league. 5 year deal, small salary cap increase, higher minimum salary. Think about inflation
To me, seems like lower tier sold out the middle,higher tier of players. Just to get min. salary increases but the salary cap not so much
Woke up to the news about #MLSCBA a done deal. I guess it's positive that the fans get to go to opening weekend &amp; league starts on time.
@BocaBoca3 @MLSAtlanta2017 congrats. I think I know a few people that could show you around!... Cc: @sryan03 &amp; @M_Ryan02 👍
@JimSias @JohnnieWalkerUS @mrkevinconnolly did Johnny Drama's calves allow him to #keepwalking?
@kylejmccarthy true, all about leverage. But, they're really abusing the start low &amp; we'll get you to agree to what we want tactic to heart.
“@SoccerInsider: Owners' apparent lone proposal: player age 32 with 10 years' experience with same club can become free agent. #mls”   😂😂😂😱🙈
@JimSias @mrdougellin @mrkevinconnolly makes me think about the Entourage movie!
@HeathGPearce agreed. But I prefer the style and fashion from Copenhagen!
@GMPunk I guess so by trying to be like a sexist celebrity gossip magazine.

@BocaBoca3 @MLSAtlanta2017 congrats my man!! All the best. Does that mean you'll be wearing suits more and less in boot cut jeans!?..😜
@salv1980 yea that's true also! But, when seeing something as a goal to work harder to provide for family, these other sports will do that.
Great to see athletes from other sports embrace soccer! #respect One day these guys will be choosing soccer over NFL, NBA etc. #MLSsalary
@OBJ_3 said he was like Messi &amp; Neymar growing up! Well, my friends would say I was like Julio Jones or Calvin Johnson! ;) #Athlete

@aehart01 you're obviously missing the point! Good night.  Let's go USWNT and USMNT! :)
@BroughtTheNoise correct. I'm all for that type of skill but hey in 5v2 &amp; keep away, Megs don't count just by ball going in between legs...
@aehart01 has nothing to do with her! She's one of the best! I do support her but not the GIF showing a soccer move that didn't even work
@MLS but what did it lead to?.. An assist/goal? And they lost right!?..  Hey kids, trust me, soccer's a lot more than the 'flashy' stuff. ;)

@KeithJH2 you can say the same about anything. In the end, it's up to people to be less ignorant and do some research on their own!
@Larkin8 you don't even know my political beliefs! Just called out the biggest latest ignorant topics. Fox News won that one. #NoPerfectSide
@CucklerJason @JohnMayer true story.
@Domaine_G my bad. Politics is politics lol. Just brought up the latest biggest ignorant topic. In general, people should do own research.
My point is whether you're right, left, or down the middle, ignorance should be called out!   Shame I'm an educated athlete. #ShockToSome
“@s_cetera: @AleBedoya17 stick to soccer, your game needs work”  Noted. Way to engage in a debate. 👍👏
“@life_of_jenks: @AleBedoya17 CNN is much better? At least fox states facts”  FYI: can't automatically believe everything from "news" source
@AJFrancis410 the sad part is that people would automatically believe whatever a "news" source says
“@srroberts47: @AleBedoya17 you are out of touch a and unfollowed. Bye”  Me? Lol Ok I think someone is brainwashed &amp; needs to get out more.
Do people watch Fox News for amusement or as a source of information!? I get that there's free speech but the ignorance is ludicrous.
