@IFuckTops6 @BryanHobbs15 @markybcool I have zero idea what you just said.
@sixnine0312 That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been saying.
@omara341 Of course Klutch/LeBron want him in L.A. And he certainly could wind up there. But they‚Äôve lost their leverage now that the deadline has passed. What if NY gets number one? Or Boston‚Äôs willing to put Tatum in a package? You HAVE to strongly consider those if you‚Äôre New Orleans.
I tried to tell y‚Äôall AD is a grown man, and will make up his own mind about where he wants to play. Not his dad, not his agent. This doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs definitely going to Boston, or would re-sign there, but he‚Äôd be a fool not to consider them seriously if he gets traded there.

Danny Ferry‚Äôs committed to be interim GM for the rest of the season in New Orleans, while everyone, including him and ownership, understands the final call on whether he becomes the full-time GM will happen after the season ends. Pels will still look at external candidates.
Make no mistake: no matter who becomes the GM in New Orleans, Mickey Loomis, the head of basketball operations for the Pelicans-and, not unimportantly, the GM of the Saints as well-has all the juice. Owner Gayle Benson trusts him and his opinion more than anyone else.

@novowels4 Yes, the guy that had 14 and 4 in 16 minutes in the first half.
The Pelicans didn‚Äôt give a professional effort against Orlando Tuesday, and they were rightly booed off the floor. Tonight, they did. It‚Äôs not rocket science. They may win, they may not. But playing hard is something they can control.
"Being professional," @Jrue_Holiday11 told @LewisJohnsonMG after the Pels beat OKC in New Orleans tonight, despite @AntDavis23 leaving w/an injury. That‚Äôs all everyone has to do. Some of y‚Äôall act like this is a tragedy. No one died. No one‚Äôs going to jail. Just be professional.

@MTCwithMook The clock is running from the minute a potential superstar is drafted: seven years, and counting. I don‚Äôt begrudge AD, LeBron or anyone from walking, or wanting to walk, after that.
@houstonfan00 The NBA did fine Davis $50K for making his trade demands public through his agent. I know he can pay it, but there are limits to what they can do; these things are collectively bargained with the union.

Aaaand the Bulls also have 12 50-win seasons since ‚Äô78-‚Äô79. (I swear, I counted everyone.) So, that‚Äôs 13 teams with double-digit 50-win seasons in the last 40 years.  D.C.: zero.
@McCadeP8 Didn‚Äôt mean to. Fixing.
And I inadvertently left out Utah, which has 15 50-win seasons since 1978-79. So that‚Äôs a dozen of the 30 current NBA teams that have double-digit 50-win seasons in the last 40 years.   The Wizards, to repeat, have none.
Seattle/OKC has 15. Dallas has 14. Houston has 13. Detroit has 13. Portland has 12. Cleveland has 11. Atlanta has 10. A third of the league has at least 10 50-win seasons in the last 40 years. The Bullets/Wizards have none.  So....yeah.
as an expansion team in 2005, has at least one 50-win season.  There have been a total of 277 50-win seasons-the bare minimum to be considered a true contending team-beginning with the 1978-79 season.   San Antonio has 26. The Lakers have 24. Phoenix has 19. Boston has 18.
The Wizards lost tonight, assuring them of a 40th straight year, dating back to 1978-79, without a 50-win season.  Starting with the 1978-79 season, the other 29 NBA franchises have played a total of 1,052 seasons.  In that time, all but one of those 29-the Hornets, established
Two goals tonight for @Kuzya92, second putting Caps up two late in the third. Six goals since the break. Warming up at the right time.
@datrurhaccordi1 @TheKylerMurray But that‚Äôs the point. It doesn‚Äôt matter what we think is best. It‚Äôs his life and his call.

Vet minimum ($2.3M), prorated for the rest of the season, for @WessyWes23 in Indiana once buyout with Knicks is complete, per league source.
No @AntDavis23 deal to the Lakers. They‚Äôll get another shot at him this offseason, and they‚Äôll still have a good chance at getting him if he reiterates that‚Äôs where he wants to be. But now, the Celtics and Knicks will, too.
@ThisBLuckyGuy @DopeSportsTakes My man, I can‚Äôt help how you interpret a fact that I wrote. Your issue, not mine. Bye.
@DopeSportsTakes No one said it was the issue. I said he‚Äôd get great coaching down there. Which he will.
Fultz desperately needed a new start. In Orlando, he won‚Äôt be the number one pick in the 2017 draft; he‚Äôll be a guy they got at the trade deadline. There will be a lot less pressure on him there, and he can get on with his career under the excellent coaching of Steve Clifford.
Fultz is free from Philly. (Say it three times fast‚Ä¶) https://t.co/HwOuUyAa4s
@rex_rexchapman Kid took the contact squared up, right on the chest. Human‚Äôs ball; let‚Äôs go!
For the east coast lunchers and west coast brunchers: Ted Leonsis needs to get with ‚Å¶@RealDealBeal23‚Å© like, yesterday, and gauge if he‚Äôs in or out: and be ready to make big changes either way. In ‚Å¶@TheAthleticDC‚Å©: https://t.co/1PZ5i3ilGd
@S0ULGIFTED Thunder usually keep it close to the vest until it‚Äôs done (PG-13, etc.). But they almost always do something at deadline so won‚Äôt surprise if they make a move again this time.
@soledadobrien My condolences, Soledad.
@LakeShow_Gang @JohnWall @RealDealBeal23 @TheAthleticDC You can‚Äôt move Wall anywhere, even if you wanted to, until he‚Äôs back on the floor-which won‚Äôt be for a year. And, no one‚Äôs going to trade for him then either, until he shows over a long stretch of games that he‚Äôs back to his old self. So Wiz can‚Äôt move Beal this season.
With the future of @JohnWall in the air, Ted Leonsis needs to get with @RealDealBeal23, like yesterday, to see if he‚Äôs in or out. If he‚Äôs in, Leonsis likely has to make other changes in his organization. In @TheAthleticDC: https://t.co/9tHcoU1PMK
Again: there is ZERO reason for the Wiz to keep Ariza after their moves. Troy Brown, their 2018  first, is barely playing. They just got Bobby Portis (RFA in July). Fine with re-signing Sato/Bryant/Portis, but putting future minutes/$ into TA, while a good dude, makes no sense.
@SGVNSports Possibly.
And, of course, the Lakers have long coveted Ariza. But L.A. doesn‚Äôt have the extra draft picks that the Nets, Kings, Hornets, etc., currently control. Would Lakers include a young role player under control with, say, KCP‚Äôs expiring deal for Ariza?
@BBennett1992 Yes, mentioned him in earlier Tweet; just ran out of space. :-)
Kings, Nets, Hornets are all in for playoff pushes. Philly needs veteran bench depth after trade for Tobias Harris Tuesday night. Doubt there‚Äôs a late first out there for Ariza, but all of the above teams have multiple seconds between 2019 and 2021.
After the Wizards‚Äô moves today, there‚Äôs absolutely no point holding on to Trevor Ariza or Jeff Green before the trade deadline Thursday. Washington still doesn‚Äôt have a second-rounder before 2023. Can replenish at least some of that deficit by moving either/both.
Wizards just got a 2023 second-rounder tonight from Chicago in the Otto Porter deal, so they were comfortable sending their own ‚Äô23 pick to NO to help facilitate this deal.
Wizards will send their own 2023 second-rounder to Pelicans along with Morris for Johnson. Washington officially now under the tax threshold for 2019-20 and thus won‚Äôt be subject to repeater taxes.
Hearing Pelicans will send Wesley Johnson to Washington for Markieff Morris, per sources.
With @johnwall out of commission, Ted Leonsis has to figure out what @RealDealBeal23 wants-stay or go. But if Beal stays, Leonsis may have to make other changes. In @TheAthleticDC: https://t.co/9tHcoU1PMK
@StayMeech Can‚Äôt get any free agents to come there. The only chance they have to add good players is via trade. Porter‚Äôs a good player; he‚Äôs just overpaid. Bulls won‚Äôt be in any danger of hitting tax threshold by acquiring OP.
Wizards now out of luxury tax jail/potential repeater taxes. Which none of you care about, and shouldn‚Äôt. But dealing Porter for Parker‚Äôs $20M (team option for next year) gives Washington opportunity to re-sign Satoransky and/or Bryant. The only reason this would make sense.
Many congrats to @Fox5DCAllison and Marc on the additional gig! Great idea by HUR! I‚Äôll be iistening!

Wizards Director of Medical Services and Orthopedist Dr. Wiemi Douoguih says @JohnWall told the team he slipped in his home Jan. 29, three weeks after the initial surgery to remove bone spurs. Douoguih says the Achilles wasn‚Äôt completely torn, but ‚Äúfunctionally,‚Äù it needs repair.

Once more, because it‚Äôs still true: the Pelicans‚Äô best trade partner for @AntDavis23 is not the Lakers, this week, before trade deadline; it‚Äôs Boston, this summer. Here‚Äôs why: https://t.co/QySdzn7Eqi

Veteran guard Courtney Lee, also acquired by Dallas today in @kporzee deal that sent @Dennis1SmithJr to New York, not looking for a buyout, per source: "he‚Äôs going in there to play and he‚Äôs excited." Lee would have been a prime pickup for playoff teams if available.

@ChiTownSports @Crayestout @AntDavis23 Demanding a trade is not against league rules. Demanding a trade PUBLICLY is against league rules.
NBA fines @AntDavis23 $50,000 for trade demand made public by his agent, Rich Paul, on Monday, for what the league called "an intentional effort to undermine the contractual relationship between Davis and the Pelicans."

@tcm0017 @AntDavis23 They can‚Äôt officially make an AD trade until July 1. But they can certainly talk about the parameters of a potential deal w/the Pelicans before then. So Boston could make picks for players in the draft that NO wants &amp; put them in a July 1 deal after Kyrie opts out.
ICYMI: Everyone in the NBA will take a run at @AntDavis23. Of course you would. But only one trade destination makes sense for the Pelicans: Boston, in July. Here‚Äôs why: https://t.co/80r452kzsB

@JoeGoodmanJr Oh, Joe, I‚Äôm so very, very sorry to hear of your loss.
@MikePradaSBN @jollyrogerwilco @wizardsfanreact Well, he was basically asked if the Wizards would tank, and the most popular recent case is Philly, b/c they were so open about it. (No one uses Sac/Orlando by comparison) It‚Äôs not crazy that he‚Äôd use Philly as an example, though his conclusions about their success are debatable.
@MikePradaSBN @wizardsfanreact There‚Äôs no reason to compare Jordan and LeBron, either. Doesn‚Äôt stop everyone from doing so. :-)
@wizardsfanreact @MikePradaSBN Of course, one must also add, Philly‚Äôs future with Embiid/Simmons/(perhaps) Butler looks to have a much higher ceiling at present and going forward than Washington‚Äôs with Wall/Beal/etc.
@wizardsfanreact @MikePradaSBN And, just for the sake of accuracy: the 76ers have not "made it further in the playoffs" than the Wizards during the Process era. Philly made the conference semis for the first time during the Process era last year; the Wizards have done that three times during the Wall/Beal era.

@NateSilver538 You can only imagine what a Jordan with no hand check, no bumping of cutters, no taking guys out of the air on drives, AND prolific on threes, would have averaged today.
@webcommenter @NateSilver538 I assume you‚Äôre referring to Wilt and not Jordan; Jordan was a career 83.5 from the line.
@NateSilver538 Comparing the ‚Äò80s/‚Äò90s NBA game to today‚Äôs game is comparing apples to kumquats, because of BOTH the rules changes that have completely changed how the game is played, along with the emphasis on threes.
@NateSilver538 Well, this is the point. If one accepts the notion that Jordan was, perhaps, the most ruthless/intelligent competitor in the history of the game, do you not think he would have become a GREAT three point shooter had that shot been emphasized when he was playing??

@AB__loading @TheAthleticDC I‚Äôm pretty sure I wrote, "There has never been any excuse for the Wizards not putting a better team around Wall and Bradley Beal through a good chunk of each player‚Äôs prime." In the story. That you, I hope, actually read.
@AB__loading @TheAthleticDC In fairness, Wall said the spurs got worse this year, which forced the surgery. But, also: coaches try and win the game that night, every night. W/Ls go on their record.

@Super70sSports Don‚Äôt bring that cheese inside to young Dusty Baker.
Triple OT.
Defense, again, can‚Äôt get a stop after the offense puts up points, letting Blaine Gabbert beat them with a 35-yarder on first down, followed by a whole lot of Henry. Titans up 19-16 with 4:30 left.
Washington with a third long scoring drive. Took almost seven minutes off the clock before bogging down. Hopkins 46-yard field goal makes it 16-12 with 8:09 remaining.
Mariota (stinger) questionable to return. Do not see him on the sideline at the moment.
Poor finish for Washington‚Äôs defense after huge touchdown drive by offense. Had two chances to get off the field on third down and didn‚Äôt tackle. Succop FG to end the half makes it 10-9 Skins at intermission.
Mariota down after that sack, being checked out. Gabbert warming up.
That is some drive from Washington. Overcame second and 27, and first and 20, to drive 93 yards‚Äîthey were actually at their own 2 after Johnson sack-- in 17 plays, taking 10:58. Defense should be rested.
Kerin (knee) questionable to return.
And Zac Kerin, who started for Tony Bergstrom, who started for Jonathan Cooper, who started for Shawn Lavauo, limps off after getting rolled up on. Kyle Fuller now in.
Tennessee marches down field with little resistance to take the lead back. XP no good. 6-3 Titans with 5:37 left in first.
1) Points on opening drive. 2) OL held up well; Johnson had a lot of time to throw.

I‚Äôm sure someone has checked into this. But it does not feel, at least apocryphally, that a two for one at the end of a quarter is worth it, on a per-point basis, to the team that‚Äôs trying to do it. Could be wrong.

I see you, Jeff Jones!! (cc: @djtweets)!! https://t.co/2WsOH9SWii
Suspect multiple teams at work trying to re-route Oubre from Suns. There was already a robust market developing for the RFA to be; those teams could just try to get him now rather than wait for the summer. Less that optimal for Oubre to be number-hunting on last place Phoenix.
No other parts: Ariza to Washington for Oubre/Rivers, per source. And that, as they say, is that.

What a beautifully written story about two guys who became unlikely friends. Knowing the Chuckster, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all: https://t.co/RzxRxtUZmC
I‚Äôm like Pacino in Godfather III: https://t.co/C8XiEJHOTD
Last last thing: Grizzlies vociferously deny they ever mentioned Dillon Brooks, to anyone. They insist that Pera never talked with Sarver. Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace: "Robert Pera did not have a conversation with Robert Sarver about this proposed trade."
Last thing: another source says this reached ownership, with Sarver and Grizz owner Robert Pera talking w/each other. And the name they discussed was Dillon. So: no guarantees, of course, but the smart money is on this deal getting resurrected in some form, quickly.
@EmbiidSimmons24 The call was not today. A request for a call was made today. That‚Äôs what I said.
@loriburnsbrooks We‚Äôd never trade you, Lori!
Per source, a trade call was requested w/the league Friday. It is pro forma for the league to double-check with all teams involved to make sure everyone agrees. It was then‚Äîbefore a trade call was officially set up‚Äîthat the Suns said Dillion, and the Grizzlies said MarShon.
Told Memphis "never" discussed Dillon Brooks with anyone in construction of the trade, and always were talking MarShon with everyone involved. Grizziles "at a loss" to understand the confusion.
And, now, as others are reporting: hearing the deal is in major trouble because of the Brooks confusion.  Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶
@johnquinn83 Yeah, you‚Äôd skew way old with an Eve Arden reference. :-)
Other Brookses not in the deal:  1)Scott 2) Mel 3) Hubie 4) Foster (only over 60 crowd will remember)
Oubre gets a re-set in Memphis, surrounded by veterans like Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. Playoff team. And there is hope that Tayshaun Prince, in the Grizzlies‚Äô front office, can help Oubre, a fellow lefty/long wing. But, no mistake‚Äîit‚Äôs put up or shut up time for Wave Papi.
No coincidence that the Wizards played some of their best basketball in the Wall-Beal era in 2013-14, when Ariza started 77 games, and Washington reached the second round before falling to Indiana. His individual/help defense that season was outstanding.
Per source, Suns owner Robert Sarver was adamant that he would not send Trevor Ariza to the Lakers, so Phoenix pivoted to other options. Wizards desperate for toughness/defensive grit, and would have had difficulty re-signing Oubre next summer.

76ers say @MarkelleF out indefinitely with Thoracic Outlet syndrome, diagnosed after his visits to specialists in recent days.
Give the @Nationals big credit here. Stepping up in a major($$) way to add @PatrickCorbin46 to bolster a staff led by @Max_Scherzer &amp; @stras37. With this kind of outlay on Corbin, one would guess they‚Äôre moving on from Harper. We‚Äôll see.

Morning Coffee, brewed in Philly: it‚Äôs time for Washington, down to its last healthy quarterback‚Äîwho just got here and doesn‚Äôt know many of his teammates‚Äô names, much less the plays‚Äîto sign Colin Kaepernick: https://t.co/MDWFNJAUgU
Been checking down all night for positive yards. Sanchez tried to go to the second level with Reed underneath for a modest gain, and threw the pick. Backbreaker.
@MikeCatalana Actually, they didn‚Äôt. That was the next season. They did come back and beat Philly in the playoffs that year, though.
Just in number of players hurt. In BBI, Philly dominated physically. Aside from the first drive tonight, that hasn‚Äôt really been the case. Washington is battling, but at some point you run out of viable bodies.
Rapidly approaching Body Bag II realm.
Tony Bergstrom (ankle) getting in a stance and trying to fire off on the sidelines. Still has his helmet on. Limping, though.
Washington, again, down to its last offensive lineman if Tony Bergstrom doesn‚Äôt return. Ty Nsekhe in for him at right guard. There‚Äôs no one left. Jonathan Cooper (arm) already out for the rest of the night.
@ColtMcCoy out for the rest of tonight (right leg injury). It‚Äôs Mark Sanchez‚Äôs show in a must-win for Washington. No, I don‚Äôt think anyone had that three weeks ago.
@David_C_Steele DOES HE HAVE‚Ä¶???
I think Sanchez‚Äôs first drive for Washington went rather well.
And, no, Sanchez did not get much work, if at all, with the ones during the week. They had to try and get McCoy up to speed as it was.
@ColtMcCoy now limping to the locker room. That means Mark Sanchez time on next Washington series.
Join us NOW for live in-game discussion on @TheAthleticDC. We‚Äôll all be jumping in during the chat: @Tarik_ElBashir, @InstantRHIplay, @kevin_spain, @MarkBullockNFL, me and @ConanOBrien. (One of these is not true.)

Some reptillian-like stuff from @KDTrey5 down the stretch tonight, including the blood-draining three with 21 seconds left to give Warriors a 113-109 lead. Forty-seven points.
I‚Äôm no coach or anything, but face guarding or otherwise taking @KlayThompson away off a simple screen would seem to be in order down the stretch for Orlando...

Gallo with the serious #careerdecision on that drive by Wall. Washington now up eight with 34.5 seconds left. Because Wizards.
Of course, the Wiz have cut it to four in the fourth. Because they‚Äôve given a damn defensively in the second half.
Wiz performance so far tonight reminds me of that scene in Bridesmaids when Officer Rhodes realizes that it‚Äôs Jon Hamm who‚Äôs going to pick up Kristen Wiig on the highway: ‚ÄúOh, COME ON!!‚Äù https://t.co/mwM4Nb8Pi9
Clips with a 40-spot in the first. @TeamLou23 hasn‚Äôt scored a point yet. Ominous for the home team.
Clippers shooting 70 percent from the floor. Scott Brooks has already used two timeouts with 1:08 left in the first. LA up 38-18. Boos throughout Capital One Arena.
Those changes are on top of @nolimittb31 starting at center in place of the still-ailing @DwightHoward.

@staceyNYCDC @LA_bron23 @BrandonT1906 Exactly. Monday was the match. The house was already soaking in kerosene.
My only slight quibble with Brother Thompson: this is how almost ALL NBA dynasties end‚Äîfrom within. Players get tired of coaches (Lakers, Riley); management gets tired of coaches (Bulls, Jackson); players get tired of each other (Lakers, Kobe-Shaq). It‚Äôs the way of things.

Dallas beats Philadelphia, leaving Washington two games ahead in the NFC East (with a 2-0 record in the division) with seven games to play. Next three games: at home vs. red-hot Houston, at Dallas on Thanksgiving Day, at Philly on Monday night, Dec. 3.
When your regular QBs are on bye, and you pick up Darnold, but he‚Äôs scratched, so you get Josh Allen, but he‚Äôs scratched, and you don‚Äôt want to take a chance on Matt Barkley, so of course he throws two TDS, and you‚Äôre left with Derek Carr and Brock Osweiler as your starters: https://t.co/DOv82JS8Kl
Rockets GM Daryl Morey, asked if @carmeloanthony is going to be on the team all season, tells reporters pregame that everyone is being evaluated. I don‚Äôt think @JHarden13 or @CapelaClint are being evaluated. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong.
@LoveThePuck Started Chubb. Brock Osweiler is my QB. The definition of meh.
That was one butt ugly win. That was one really necessary win. All non-OL personnel on offense should be buying all drinks tonight for defense/Way.
Great block from Nsekhe on the weak side toss to Peterson to get the first down. This patchwork OL has held up very well today.
Washington is getting every break imaginable in this game. Have to take advantage of Tampa‚Äôs gifts.
I know this is a cliche, but Washington has to take some shots down the field in the second half. The makeshift OL has held up well so far in pass protection.
Looked like a forward pass. We‚Äôll see.
So far, according to likely script: Bucs can gain chunks through the air. Bucs can also turn the ball over. Washington takes advantage of the latter on @J_No24 interception at the goal line.
This was outstanding, from everyone involved. Never Forget: https://t.co/VqgOw08SeK

It‚Äôs game day in Tampa! Our @Tarik_ElBashir will do a live pregame Q&amp;A at noon Eastern from Raymond James Stadium at @TheAthleticDC. Join in!
@Super70sSports Coach Reeves was a strong proponent of Pat Riley‚Äôs philosophy: ‚Äúplay eight, use seven, trust six, win with five.‚Äù
Communicating on D, helping, rebounding, going strong to the cup. @WashWizards finally play well and beat Miami on second night of back to back‚Äîwhich should tick them and their fans off even more. Playing hard shouldn‚Äôt be that hard.
@NotAffiliated71 That‚Äôs not an unfair position. Just stating that two solid/plus NBA players is a good return, given that Minnesota had absolutely no leverage.
@Sam_Vecenie Exactly. The four firsts didn‚Äôt really hold up under scrutiny. At least 2-3 of them were likely to be in the 20s if Houston continued to be a top-3 team in the west.
@jmrwojcik Fair point. But, he has to make this work in Philly to get the deal he wants next summer, whether from the Sixers or somewhere else.
@KCJ_Swish Yup. Gamble for Philly, but understandable they wanted to take the shot.
@beendoggy Yes, I did: a swing shooting 39 percent on threes who‚Äôs a top notch wing defender, a former Lottery pick and a future pick is, indeed, a very good haul for a guy everyone knew Minnesota had to move. Wolves had no leverage, and still made a good deal. But thanks for your input.
Don‚Äôt know how the chemistry will ultimately work between Butler/Simmons/Embiid, but Philly now has a trio that puts it right back in the mix in the east with Boston, Toronto and Milwaukee.
@bullwings99 Wolves wanted Beal, which was a non-starter for Washington; BB is, relatively speaking, on a better contract than what Butler would have demanded to re-sign.
This is quite a haul for the Wolves for a disgruntled player everyone in the league knew they had to move: https://t.co/wWkzQam4nZ
Philly always made sense for Butler, and with the Sixers‚Äô uneven start, need met timing. And Wolves get him out of the west.

When you don‚Äôt want to relive history: a day of injury all along the O-line has Washington playing and plugging and out of depth, just like last year: https://t.co/6pvermpLYW
Just noticed a team called the "Wizards" playing tonight that seems like it gives a damn about the defensive end of the floor. Can anyone fill me in on their personnel?

U mad bro/sis? Postgame chat with @MrChickSports starts at 4:15 Eastern at @TheAthleticDC. Vent away!
Julio Jones‚Äôs first touchdown of the season. Atlanta has dominated all day; up 38-14. Stands are bright yellow and orange.
More importantly, my fantasy teams currently have nine and five percent chances, respectively, of victory today. The Season of Awful continues.
Washington down 28-14 after three. Yes, Falcons have some important defensive players out, but considering the score, the complete lack of a running game today and the slew of injuries, what‚Äôs left of OL is holding up amazingly well in pass protection thus far.
For Washington, Brandon Scherff (shoulder) officially out.
Current OL, L-R: Christian, Nsekhe, Roullier, Bergstrom, Moses.
Falcons‚Äô first punt of the day, with six minutes left in the third.
Wait: Moses did come back earlier. So Redskins can run a play here, not that it will matter much on third and 34 after UC penalty on Moses following the play.
And Scherff is now done. There is no one left to take his place.
Falcons‚Äô carving of Washington‚Äôs defense continues unabated. Saints-like.
Atlanta 8 of 8 on third downs so far today. Average third down yardage: 6.3 yards. Washington had been one of the best teams in the league in getting off the field on third and long‚Äîuntil today.
The conundrum that is Josh Doctson.
Morgan Moses back in at RT for Washington.
Ty Nsekhe already starting for Trent Williams, Bergstrom now in for Lauvao, Christian in for Moses. There‚Äôs no one left.
Now Morgan Moses is down. Washington‚Äôs last available lineman, Geron Christian, now has to step in. Moses walking off.
Shawn Lauvao helped off, not putting any weight on his left leg.
Pregame chat with @InstantRHIplay is live NOW on @TheAthleticDC. Send in your questions before kickoff! (Inactives for the Skins: Chris Thompson, Adonis Alexander, Kenny Ladler, Casey Dunn, Trent Williams, Jamison Crowder, Brian Quick.
We‚Äôre very chatty today at @TheAthleticDC: at the top of the hour, it‚Äôs @InstantRHIplay with all your pregame questions, until 12:45 Eastern. After the game, join @MrChickSports for a postgame chat, starting at 4:15 Eastern. #yakyakyak

Asked this morning, and despite a horrible 1-7 start in which they‚Äôre giving up an almost inconceivable 123.9 ppg and sport a 115.9 Defensive Rating, the Wizards are not contemplating any coaching changes.

And Rose blocks the last-second, potential game-tying three by Dante Exum. Fifty points for Rose, a win for the Wolves. Most unexpected 50-spot since Andre (The Professor) Miller dropped 52 on the Mavs in 2010.
Two free throws for @drose. Fifty spot. Wolves up three over Utah with :13.8 left.
Make it 48.
Way, way, wayyyyyback for @drose: 46 points and counting. Wolves, Jazz tied at 123 with :36.9 left.
Reverse: A day after reinstating D.J. Durkin as head coach, Maryland changes course and fires him. The latest from @NicoleAuerbach at @TheAthletic: https://t.co/3GhKV4DqAU

@dudefromtoledo @haha_cd6 @nflnetwork He‚Äôs new, isn‚Äôt he? #blocked
@marconi64 @JackDowney1 All but 4-5 games since Favre‚Äôs first season there. And, all @PFF does is watch football games, and they have HHCD ranked as the number two safety in football as of last week‚Äîbehind Swearinger.
Washington sends fourth-round pick to Green Bay for @haha_cd6, per @nflnetwork. For a former first-rounder who‚Äôs still just 25 (free agent after this season, I know, but still), pretty good deal.
Washington getting @haha_cd6 from Green Bay (@nflnetwork reporting) is quite interesting. D.J. Swearing playing at All-Pro level; Montae Nicholson has been solid. But Skins now have top two rated safeties in NFL per most recent Pro Football Focus rankings.
No surprise: @spurs announce they will retire the number 20 of @manuginobili. Ceremony on March 28 at AT&amp;T Center during San Antonio‚Äôs game with the Cavaliers.

@LoungeNba Of course many would have viewed it that way. I would look at it as acknowledging the team/coaches put together to try to win championships had run its course. Which is why I was surprised they didn‚Äôt also move Korver in the summer, etc.
@AlexVerkley Normally, yes. But given Lue‚Äôs ties to LeBron, I just figured that they‚Äôd want to start over with someone new once LeBron left. So why not just get it over with during the offseason and give the new coach a chance to put all their stuff in during camp/preseason?
Meanwhile‚Ä¶had to share this great, great read from @tashanreed from Florida State‚Äôs home demolition by Clemson. He found and interviewed the Shirtless, Reading Man!: https://t.co/71w2Ai3twF
@sidelinejoe8 I believe he had that, yes.
@koppa34 By the very large ring they all wear from 2016.
It‚Äôs not that the Cavs fired Lue. Obviously, he was the guy who could get the most out of LeBron, and LeBron isn‚Äôt there any more. But‚Ä¶six games? I never get how, if you feel squeamish about a guy in the summer, you don‚Äôt just cashier him then so your new guy gets a fresh start.

Three third down wins by the defense, three penalties on the defense to extend the drive. No chance to win giving a QB that good extra plays.
Just an awful penalty when you‚Äôre supposed to be getting off the field.

Ugh: Spurs announce @DejounteMurray suffered  a torn right ACL in preseason game Sunday. Timeline for his return coming later.
NBA annnounces Marcus Smart fined $25,000, J.R. Smith $15,000 for roles in altercation during preseason game Saturday. Smith fined for initiating altercation; Smart fined for escalating altercation.
Suns did fire Earl Watson just four games into last season as head coach. But the timing of this is especially odd, after what was universally viewed as a very good offseason for Suns (drafting @DeandreAyton, signing @TrevorAriza, getting @DevinBook signed to max extension).
Stunned by the timing of this: Suns announce they‚Äôve fired GM Ryan McDonough. VP/Basketball Ops James Jones &amp; assistant GM Trevor Bukstein will handle interim duties: Jones will manage basketball operations, Bukstein will be the primary contact for player transactions.

In other news, the worst guest ever on Mr. Roarke‚Äôs Island‚Äîthink Bert Convy‚Äîhas a better Fantasy team than I do.
Unless the @NFL has discovered that Newton‚Äôs First Law of Motion is no longer operative, it has to address this ridiculous Roughing The Passer interpretation it has adopted this season.
That‚Äôs just a Godawful call‚Äîagain‚Äîon Clay Mathews. God. Awful.
Washington wins a challenge for the first time since‚Ä¶hard to remember the last time. Better take advantage and start going downfield again against Packers‚Äô secondary.
Washington better not start getting conservative. Recipe for disaster against Twelve.
The 14-year-old: "why didn‚Äôt they just have Rodgers throw a Hail Mary? Just as good a chance as a 61-yard field goal." Can‚Äôt argue with that.
A heck of a throw in the red zone by Alex Smith.
"Let‚Äôs Go Crazy" to sell a credit card? No.

@GCTigerTracker I Spy... https://t.co/c5XnIzDkbM
Cynthia Marshall, the Mavs‚Äô CEO hired in the wake of the initial stories, says: "we appreciate the women and their courage, and we thank them, again, for coming forward."
Milgram is asked why there wasn‚Äôt more of a public outcry after the initial SI story was published. She says there was both fear on the part of employees to come forward and that the majority of women in all businesses don‚Äôt report harassment, b/c most are retaliated against.
Milgram says that Mavericks employees came to believe that there would be no accountability for division chiefs who consistently engaged in abusive conduct.
Anne Milgram, special counsel in charge of the Mavericks‚Äô probe, says Mark Cuban was "incredibly cooperative." She says Cuban sat for a day-long interview &amp; several follow-up phone interviews, &amp; also sat w/investigators and NBA officials, including Commissioner Adam Silver.
NBA-backed investigation into @dallasmavs workplace finds "numerous instances" of sexual harassment. League says no evidence @mcuban was aware of misconduct, but he will give $10M to orgs combating DV &amp; advancing women in the sports industry: https://t.co/2VagNrJs2E
Wolves, obviously, can try and convince @JimmyButler to stay. But here‚Äôs what he told me in February: "I mean, in the most humble way possible, if they don‚Äôt take care of me this summer, I think the summer after that, I‚Äôm‚Äôa end up playing somewhere." The "else" was left unsaid.

@LylykStephen @ChrissieEvert Anyway, gotta go. #blocked
@LylykStephen @ChrissieEvert No, I think I‚Äôm a big tough guy ‚Äòcause I work out. The checkmark means I‚Äôm popular.
@LylykStephen @ChrissieEvert Awww‚Ä¶you think you‚Äôre insulting me, don‚Äôt you? That‚Äôs so cool.
@ChrissieEvert I love that Twitter allows Guy Who Hasn‚Äôt Gotten off Couch Since Bush 43 to think he can Mansplain the rules/history of tennis to someone with 18 Grand Slam titles.
@Ghenson55 @TaylorRooks @Naomi_Osaka_ No, he‚Äôs not. Osaka is.
@CarefreeTom Loud. Wrong:  https://t.co/OZfyeZuRiT
@ohElleCampbell I‚Äôve just seen/heard refs, in all sports, take control of a situation that was threatening to get out of hand with firm but calm words: "I heard you. You‚Äôve had your say. I don‚Äôt want to hear any more." Doesn‚Äôt work every time, but it works a lot of times.
@1nancyschindler @NormOrnstein I do, too. She would have won, anyway. She outplayed Serena, and she‚Äôs a kid who was playing her idol, and anyone who booed her afterward is a bum.
@douged33 It was an extremely unusual time to insert oneself into a GS final, especially when the player was at the opposite end of the court. And it made the subsequent penalties harsher than they otherwise would have been.
@Andy_Williams16 No. I‚Äôm saying a veteran ump/ref knows they‚Äôre going to get yelled at. And they can handle it short of taking a point/game away. "By the book" is one way to ref, but in my experience covering sports, the best umps/refs don‚Äôt do that.
What does he know about tennis? Amirite? https://t.co/1swDTyB7fc
Twitter Cops are the same people who‚Äôll cry when they get a ticket for going 28 in a 25, but are the first to say "the rules are the rules!" when they don‚Äôt apply to them.
Some of y‚Äôall who are getting the vapors that Serena called the ref a "thief" &amp; demanded an apology, and say that warranted a game penalty, have apparently never been at or played in any game involving a referee/umpire. ‚ÄòCause parents cuss out umps at Little League games.
@omcurban Agree with both of those points.
This is not your fault, Naomi. Do not let anything steal your joy.
And @Naomi_Osaka_ played her heart out, and outplayed Serena, and completely deserved the victory over her idol. I feel terrible for her. The referee can‚Äôt do what he did today. You use discretion, and warnings. You don‚Äôt take points and games away in a Slam final.
This is awful. Just awful.
@GCTigerTracker You owe rent, alimony, child support. You play for money. Your kids eat. You got stones enough not to chase cards, action..or (bleepin‚Äô) pipe dreams of winning the World Series on ESPN.

Incredible gut check from @De11eDonne to play with that bone bruise the last two games, @KristiToliver with big shots throughout the series and, like I said, a non-rookie rookie in @HeirTrip. First @WNBA Finals appearance for the @WashMystics!
Great defense there by the Mystics when they needed a championship stop. (By the way: somebody‚Äôs lying, ‚Äòcause @HeirTrip ain‚Äôt playing like a rookie.)

Ginobili popularized the Eurostep (why it isn‚Äôt called "the Ginobil Step" is unclear to me; AI‚Äôs footwork is known everywhere as "the Iverson cut").  And he was as fierce a competitor as the game has know. My all-time favorite Manu moment. Dude was 36:   https://t.co/W7c4s4qz5v
Hard to quantify the impact @manuginobili had on the game. He ignited Argentina‚Äôs rise as a world power (silver medal at the World Cup in 2002, gold at the Olympics in 2004). And he was as important to the Spurs‚Äô 4 titles on his watch (2002-18) as anyone outside of Tim Duncan.

Correct readers have correctly corrected me: @Michael8easley did play in Miami over parts of two seasons, but only one of those was while @KingJames was still in Miami (2013-14, James‚Äôs last with the Heat). #DepartmentofCorrections
There were places with more potential playing time for @Michael8easley, but a tough market for free agents this summer made a $3.5 million payday w/the Lakers the best option. Beasley also played with @KingJames in Miami in 79 games over two seasons (2013-15).
@JalenRose @MollyQerim Congratulations!!!
Suns will send $1 million to Philadelphia in the trade for @Rich_Holmes22, per source. The Dudley trade to Brooklyn opened up the cap space necessary to take in Holmes. Suns see Holmes as a five with rim running/shot blocking skills.
Meanwhile, @JaredDudley619, traded to Brooklyn from Phoenix this morning, tells me he plans to play for the Nets. Says the Nets need a stretch four and that he thinks he needs to show that he can still contribute to a team.
Ujiri acknowledges the Raptors would have had no chance at Leonard without the "medical drama" surrounding Leonard. Says they‚Äôve seen some of the medical reports on Leonard, and "the rest will depend on the physical that‚Äôs coming."
Ujiri says both he and assistant GM Bobby Webster have spoken with Leonard: "I didn‚Äôt get a sense (from Leonard) of any negativity or anything different from just wanting to know me, or know us, better, and looking forward to meeting and talking face to face."
Asked how tough firing Dwane Casey &amp; trading DeRozan was, Ujiri says, "honestly, it‚Äôs not about me. It‚Äôs about them. I repeat, the human part of this business is what I‚Äôm about. The other part‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just tough for me." But also says he gave team a chance before making the moves.
Asked if the Raptors had assured DeRozan he wouldn‚Äôt be traded, Ujiri said: "I had a conversation with DeMar at Summer League, and I really want to leave it at that‚Ä¶I think maybe my mistake is talking about what we expected from him going forward."
Asked what he‚Äôs trying to sell to Leonard about Toronto, Ujiri says, "I think there‚Äôs a lot to sell here‚Äîour team, our culture, our city, our ownership. We have everything here except a championship, in my humble opinion."
Ujiri says the Raptors had to jump on the opportunity to get a player the caliber of Kawhi Leonard. Says he‚Äôs spoken with Leonard and his uncle "and everything has gone well‚Ä¶that‚Äôs our responsibility, to figure it out and make them as comfortable as possible.
Ujiri: "DeMar has done so much for this organization. When you‚Äôre in my position you always have to be open in what you can do. Both of us had a conversation, and me and DeMar know what that conversation was. Maybe I could have handled it better. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm apologizing for."

Teams have to do what‚Äôs in their. Interest. It‚Äôs a business. Having said that, DeMar DeRozan repped Toronto for nine years, selling the virtues of the city/teamnever even took a visit elsewhere when a free agent and was a major part of buildingthat franchise to where it is today.
Meanwhile, @DeMar_DeRozan not backing off of claim he was lied to by Toronto regarding a potential trade, per source. Extremely upset.
Jakob Poertl and draft picks also going to the Spurs, per sources.
Kawhi Leonard has been informed that the trade to the Raptors has gone through, pending physicals‚Äîand given his injury, that is not nothing. Assuming he passes, per source, a long term stay in Toronto past this year is going to be ‚Äúa very tough sell.‚Äù
Raptors know the risks involved with potential Kawhi Leonard acquisition, given his preference for playing in L.A. But they have great faith in their young players going forward regardless of what Leonard decides to do in 2019.

@ByTimReynolds @rick_bonnell A hole just opened up in the universe. We are doomed.
All four years of the Grizzlies‚Äô offer sheet (four years, $37.15M) to Kyle Anderson (@wojespn first) are guaranteed, per source. Memphis likes Anderson‚Äôs real plus-minus, wants guys like Slo-Mo (&amp; picks Jaren Jax/Jevon Carter) who one from winning organizations like the Spurs.
Additional facets to the LaVine offer sheet: https://t.co/B0xVIyFHlW
Zach LaVine‚Äôs four-year, $78 million offer sheet from the Kings (@ShamsCharania first with report of agreement) includes the maximum allowable advance (a large chunk of the yearly salary can be paid to the player before the start of the season) and no team/player option.
Pelicans will re-up with guard Ian Clark, per source.
Tony Parker had made no secret last season‚Äîhis 17th with the Spurs‚Äîthat he hoped to play three more years in San Antonio to reach 20 before retiring. Which makes his leaving for Charlotte all the sadder. It‚Äôs certainly not because of money.
@CBeswick Learn to listen. When you start, you don‚Äôt know anything, and that‚Äôs not a criticism, it‚Äôs reality. No one knows anything when you get your first beat. You learn by listening, not pretending you know everything, and not being afraid to say "I don‚Äôt know" or "I don‚Äôt understand."

Not quite as athletic as he used to be, but athletic enough for @JohnWall, I‚Äôd reckon. And would certainly be a legit starting five for a team that badly needs one. https://t.co/bAktm0t2aQ
The Sixers could immediately re-route newly acquired @wilsonchandler in any potential, uh, trade, b/c his salary is going into the team‚Äôs available cap space. But the plan is for Philly to keep him, per league sources; his two-way play when healthy is viewed as a needed asset.

This is a momentous night in L.A., obviously for @MagicJohnson and GM Rob Pelinka. But it is biggest, I think, for @JeanieBuss. She made a very, VERY difficult personal decision in ‚Äò17 to shake up her front office to do just this: land a superstar. Her new FO did. Kudos to her.
Because of course. https://t.co/I7Kt8aFKDv
Four years, $82 million for Aaron Gordon to stay in Orlando, per source.
So, why did James pick the Lakers? ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs earned the right to do what he wants to do,‚Äù source involved in the discussion says.
@NickVanExit @netw3rk $1 US=$1 Milton
Source confirms one year/$12 Milton for @CaldwellPope to come back to Lakers (@ChrisBHaynes and @ShamsCharania first).
Klutch Sports release: @KingJames agrees to four-year, $154 million deal with the Lakers.
We yak. And yak. And yak. Free Agent Fever, on @NBATV, with @CaseyStern, @dg_riff, @EricPincus and me, for two hours. Now.
Certainly makes sense for LA to look into Capela, even if it‚Äôs a long shot. Can‚Äôt imagine Rockets wouldn‚Äôt match any potential offer sheet, but no harm in trying.
Lakers, working multiple scenarios, will meet this afternoon with Rockets RFA Clint Capela, per league source.
@AUEJackson LOL!
You can expect Sixers‚Äô pitch to LeBron, w/owners Josh Harris &amp; David Blitzer making the case, to center on the culture that Brett Brown has maintained through FO changes/losing, elite defenders in Embiid/Covington and a style of play/firepower that can challenge GS immediately.
Warriors, Lakers, Pelicans and Thunder currently in the mix for @JaValeMcGee, per source.
All guaranteed money for Fred Van Vleet on two-year, $18 million deal to stay in Toronto (@MikeAScotto, @ShamsCharania first).
Jerami Grant deal with OKC (three years, $27M, @wojespn first) includes player option for third year, per source.
Confirming one year, $10 million for Rudy Gay to return to the Spurs (@ShamsCharania first).
For those of you who still are arguing that teams are crazy to try and get Kawhi Leonard, even for a year: Paul George, who everyone insisted would be going to L.A. come hell or high water, is going back to OKC. Because they convinced him to stay.
@jadande @hbryant42 @ChristianArcand And the film in which the Liza version was sung (also "New York, New York," with Robert DeNiro) is an underrated flick.
And no one will be surprised when he signs with them. https://t.co/lF38DOfb9Q
Nuggets in the driver‚Äôs seat for Will Barton (@ChrisMannisYS first), with number potentially north of reported $50M deal.
Live look-in at @russwest44 party with @Yg_Trece in OKC:  https://t.co/cIpBMmPINn
Yes, @KDTrey5 took a little less than he could have. But he was determined to be a free agent again in 2019, when the cap is now projected to be $109M‚Äîa bump up from original projections‚Äîwith many more teams having cap room, and with the Dubs set to move into their new arena.
We start yakking about free agency tonight at 10 E/7P on @NBATV, and we won‚Äôt stop until the last of the 30 men is left in the squared circle &amp; wins the Battle Royal! Oops. We don‚Äôt have a Battle Royal. But we will have Free Agent Fever, w @CaseyStern, @dg_riff, @EricPincus &amp; me.
Among the non-Kawhi bait players around the NBA who are available via trade, per league sources: Denver‚Äôs Wilson Chandler, New York‚Äôs Courtney Lee, Atlanta‚Äôs Kent Bazemore. And as @TheSteinLine reported, the Raptors have let it be known there are no untouchables on their roster.
Wizards finalizing deal to bring Robert Pack to the bench as an assistant coach, per league sources. It‚Äôs a good hire. Pack should have a solid working relationship with John Wall.
Mavericks will be clear favorites to sign Jordan, three years after he verbally agreed to a deal in Dallas then changed his mind at the 11th hour to stay with the Clippers.
Source confirms (@wojespn first) that @DeAndre will opt out of the final year of his deal and enter free agency Sunday morning.
ICYMI: only one team can sign @KingJames. Here are 25 under the radar unrestricted free agents that could help any team: https://t.co/2ZWwoGRpX9
@MGortat @WashWizards @MonSportsNet @TedLeonsis Best of luck to the Hammer!
Kings had been working on the expectation that Temple would opt in for next year. With so many teams capped out already for next season and approaching the luxury tax threshold, the market for free agents underneath the LeBron/Paul George level will be tight.
James‚Äôs decision to opt out makes a potential trade with the Rockets less likely. It helps the Lakers, who would like to use their existing assets to make a Kawhi Leonard trade, and use their cap space to make James a max contract offer.
LeBron James will not be exercising his option for next season, making him a free agent Sunday.
@HowardBeck https://t.co/pI7X3uEGXZ
Pacers forward Thaddeus Young is opting in for next season, per source. Will make $13.7 million next year.
@AdiJoseph @RetepAdam @ColinCBSSports Uh‚Ä¶  https://t.co/2ZWwoGRpX9
Everyone can‚Äôt sign LeBron. But your team could well be able to get one of these 25 under the radar unrestricted free agents starting Sunday https://t.co/2ZWwoGRpX9.
Rumblings yesterday, apparently solidifying today. Pack played for the then-Bullets in ‚Äô95 and was on Scotty Brooks‚Äôs staff in OKC from 2013-15. https://t.co/RgAfrED82i
No sentient person is surprised the Wizards are moving Gortat. He and Wall were oil and water. Washington needs a center, though. Would not be shocked if Wizards consider UFA Nerlens Noel (Dallas).

I love covering this league and the people in it like @officialmutombo, the winner of this year‚Äôs Sager Strong award.
There are two people every modern NBA player should thank, every time they step on the floor, for the life they can live now and the money they make today: Oscar Robertson and @SpencerHaywood. Every time.
Dwane Casey, head coach of the Detroit Pistons, wins the 2017-18 Coach of the Year award for the work he did‚Ä¶for the Toronto Raptors. And handles it with class, as he always does.

Former Arizona guard Allonzo Trier, undrafted tonight, signs a two-way deal afterward with the Knicks, per source.
Seton Hall‚Äôs Angel Delgado, a dominant rebounder the last three years in college (led the nation in boards in 2016-17), who won this year‚Äôs Kareem Abdul-Jabbar award, agrees to a two-way deal with the Clippers, per source.
Pretty slick work there by the Pistons, getting a couple of solid guard prospects midway through the second round in Khryi Thomas (trade with Philly for two future seconds) and Bruce Brown (taken 42nd overall by Detroit).
Indeed: Pistons are getting the Draft rights to Khyri Thomas (38th overall) from Philly, per source.
Hearing Detroit may be getting involved with one of these Philly picks, per league source.
There simply couldn‚Äôt be a better fit of player to city than Jevon Carter and the Grizzlies. Ultimate grinder. May be my favorite player in the Draft. On-ball defensive beast.
If the Hawks are holding onto Omari Spellman, they have added three legit shooters in Young, Huerter and Spellman at the guard, wing and big positions to go with more D-oriented Taurean Prince and John Collins.
Lots of concern about Musa‚Äôs frame around the league, but the Nets were one of the teams that didn‚Äôt think that was as big an issue. He can definitely score.
At 27.
The Celtics, who need a young center, will now have their pick of Robert Williams, Omari Spellman or Mitchell Robinson at 26.
Blazers, at 24, have centered on IMG Academy guard @AnferneeSimons and French guard Elie Okobo.
Bulls have been linked to Boise State‚Äôs Chandler Hutchison at 22 for a while.
Duke‚Äôs Grayson Allen the likely pick for the Jazz at 21.
Sixers get rights to @zhaire_smith from Phoenix for rights to @mikal_bridges.
Wizards would not have taken Michael Porter even if he had been on the board.
Charlotte, picking 11th, has been linked to @shaiglalex for a while. FWIW.
As reported an hour ago, Knicks were locked in on either @KevKnox or @MilesBridges. Opted for Knox.
Cavs were in on Collin Sexton from jump, loving not only his defensive chops, but his demeanor. Crushed it in his interviews with team management.
Bamba‚Äôs improvement with player development coach @DrewHanlen at the offensive end was significant in workouts. They‚Äôve lowered his shot pocket, moved his finger placement on the ball and eliminated a hitch in his shot. Still has work to do, but has come a long way quickly.
You can count the Magic as beyond stunned/thrilled that Mo Bamba fell to them at six.
Several Lottery teams that have seen the most recent medical information on Michael Porter, Jr., are not any more swayed toward taking him than they were before, per league sources.Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre less inclined to take him; still a risk/reward decision for them.
Earlier iterations of the deal involved Kent Bazemore and Wes Matthews, but Hawks didn‚Äôt think Matthews was a fit for their rebuilding team. Opted instead for a pick for pick deal with some small protections on the future first they‚Äôre getting from Dallas.
Hawks, Mavericks are making a trade that will send the third pick overall from Atlanta to Dallas for the fifth pick and a future first from the Mavs, per sources. @TheSteinLine first with the trade disclosure.
Like the new touch of having players invited to the Green Room introduced with their families‚Äîincluding Aaron Holiday coming in with older brothers Jrue and Justin.
Our NBA Draft coverage from Barclays Center begins at 7 p.m. on @NBATV with @CaseyStern, @steve21smith, @dg_riff, @JaredSGreenberg, @SethDavisHoops and @EricPincus. Enjoy the Draft!
As we get closer to the Draft, hearing the Knicks are increasingly centering on @KevKnox and @MilesBridges if they stay at nine.
Great comparison right now by @CoachDManning for @TheTraeYoung: forget Nash/Curry. Think Damon Stoudemire. Mighty Mouse could go!
About to be on TV from 5-7 Eastern on @NBATV for our Draft 2018 preview, with @MattWinerTV, @StuJackson32, @bwood_33, @CoachDManning in the ATL and a cast of thousands‚Äîokay, seven or eight‚Äîin New York.
At two, Kings continue to be centered on @MB3FIVE, per sources. Ownership is on board but it‚Äôs the basketball people‚Äôs call. Growing sense that Bagley‚Äôs unique skill set is just too good to pass up.
Two and a half hours before the Draft begins, nothing from anyone/anywhere around the league indicates anything other than @DeandreAyton going first to Suns, per league sources.
RIP, Mr. Capps. A legend at both old Chicago Stadium and United Center. https://t.co/hsUgETnksD

Paul George made it clear he wanted to play for the Lakers. The Pacers didn‚Äôt trade him to the Lakers, but they got him out of the east. OKC took the risk on a one-year PG rental. You don‚Äôt think Philly or Boston (potentially) wouldn‚Äôt take a similar risk on Kawhi Leonard?
Perhaps this is hard for some of y‚Äôall to get, but why would the Spurs enthusiastically participate in building a potential THIRD superpower in the west w/GS/HOU by sending Leonard to L.A. for‚Ä¶who/what? Or have you forgotten what Indy did less than a year ago with PG13?
Now: 1) If the Spurs grant Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs request, they're under no obligation to trade him to a "preferred" team. 2) Their only obligation would be to make the best deal 4 themselves. 3) And it would clearly make more sense for them to trade him east than keep him in the west.
The issues that have separated Leonard and the Spurs have not been bridged, at least to the satisfaction of the two-time Defensive Player of the Year, two-time All-Star and 2014 Finals MVP.
Kawhi Leonard, indeed, wants out of San Antonio, per source. And NBA Summer is officially on fire.

@Super70sSports Nothing says ‚ÄúMay Sweeps Gold‚Äù like the sweet sight of a Dick Van Patton-Ken Howard anchor leg.
Pistons say that Dwane Casey/other candidates had/have autonomy on picking entire staff, despite multiple sources saying otherwise. (That would hardly be unprecedented; new coaches often inherit a member of the former staff/hire assistants management likes. But, FWIW.)
In this week‚Äôs Morning Tip: couldn‚Äôt LeBron get free agents to come to Cleveland https://t.co/vtoW1ZE9s9, Q&amp;A with Warriors GM Bob Myers https://t.co/DVgpiiOigj &amp; your Mailbag questions on the Finals and the Suns https://t.co/11zXTKyWvJ.
Gores, advisor Ed Stefanski and vice chairman Arn Tellem impressed Casey that they‚Äôd back him long term while the team addresses the roster. It became a formidable group to turn down, per source.
When Dwane Casey left Cleveland Saturday morning, he was not inclined to take the Pistons‚Äô job. But ownership/management led by Tom Gores put a full-court press on over the weekend to get the deal done‚Äîand relented on letting the new coach pick his assistants, per sources.

@Super70sSports Dude top right looks like Gordon Gekko‚Äôs much less successful brother, Donald J. Gekko, Jr. Gordon gave him the accounts he didn‚Äôt even bother to cheat on.
Josh Harris doesn't give a definitive answer about Chairman of BaskOps Jerry Colangelo‚Äôs future, (under contact through the end of 2018): "we‚Äôre going to be talking about it. But that‚Äôs not today‚Äôs issue‚Ä¶my respect for him is certainly not colored by this unfortunate situation."
Brett Brown on whether he‚Äôll have to put out fires with prospective free agents next month: "I feel most strongly that when we go into a place with my coaches, and we bring Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons in with me, that will be sufficient."
Asked who‚Äôll have final say on Draft night, Josh Harris says "it‚Äôs very rare you can‚Äôt ultimately arbitrate a decision," but if that happenedt, "I guess myself, David (Blitzer, co-owner) and Brett would have to get in a room and figure it out."
Principal owner Josh Harris says he would like to have a permanent GM in place by the end of June/start of free agency, but suspects it might take a little longer to finish search.
Sixers Coach Brett Brown, named to temporarily oversee basketball ops after Bryan Colangelo‚Äôs replacement, says he has no interest in assuming traditional GM role, citing other people already in the front office: "we have the firepower to move this forward and not miss a beat."

I‚Äôve lost count, but that‚Äôs roughly the 783rd screen Golden State has slipped tonight for a layup, dunk or foul.
Cavs hoped for some productive minutes from @rodneyhood in place of Clarkson tonight, and he was decent: 6 points (3-4 FG) and 4 rebounds in 20 minutes. Took a -7 because of the back to back three-point plays by Durant in the last minute.
Warriors started 3 of 9 with four turnovers before Iguodala came in with 6:21 left in the first. Afterward, they were 7 of 10 with no turnovers.

@Super70sSports You do realize that sometime in, say, February of ‚Äò79, an associate producer at ABC, having worked nonstop the previous six weeks on nothing else, stuck his head in his boss‚Äôs office and said, almost with an air of triumph: ‚Äúwe got Irwin Corey!!‚Äù
Per Steve Kerr, @andre did some on-court work Monday and said he felt better; Kerr said Iguodala would likely be listed as questionable for Game 3 Wednesday, with the hope he‚Äôll be available for Game 4 if he can‚Äôt play tomorrow.

Steve Kerr on status of @andre (lower left leg contusion) for Game 7: ‚Äúif Andre can play, he‚Äôll play. But I would call him doubtful, just because it‚Äôs gone on this long, and he‚Äôs had a lot of pain. So we‚Äôll just keep taking it day by day.‚Äù
D‚ÄôAntoni, on conference call: "I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs tested it at all. He‚Äôs just getting treatment and making sure it calms down and everything." Says treatment is just about 24/7.
Mike D‚ÄôAntoni says @CP3 will still be listed as questionable going into Monday‚Äôs Game 7, but final determination may not be made until Monday afternoon when team doctors are expected to check him out.

Expect top assistant Darvin Ham to join Mike Budenholzer in Milwaukee, per sources, along with most, if not all, of his former Hawks coaching staff.
Kings in perfect position at number two‚Äîwill have their pick of Ayton/Doncic or @MB3FIVE, and their fans should be delighted with any of those outcomes.
I know the Suns hired Igor Kokoskov, and that he coached @luka7doncic in Slovenia. But it‚Äôs going to be awfully hard for Phoenix to pass on @DeandreAyton. Played just up the road. Phenomenal offensive talent, though there are questions about his consistency and defensive effort.

Raptors assistants Rex Kalamian, Nick Nurse will get consideration for head coach job, per source, along with Mike Budenholzer and others. Kalamian/Nurse each highly regarded, veteran coaches who‚Äôve been part of young player development in Toronto.
Hawks want someone who has familiarity with a long-term rebuild/player development a la the 76ers. Atlanta has multiple Draft picks in next two years but turnaround is not guaranteed to be that quick.
All signs pointing to Sixers assistant Lloyd Pierce as the next Hawks coach, per league sources. GM Travis Schlenk worked w/Pierce at Golden State. Pierce has met multiple times with Hawks management/ownership, including majority owner Tony Ressler in Boston Tuesday.
@33lev @KingJames @utahjazz Exactly. It‚Äôs hard to stand pat when you have a team good enough to win a title, but don‚Äôt. I get that. But Casey did everything asked of him this year‚Äîmore ball movement, less iso from stars, return to defensive principles, development of the young players across the board.
@FaboRollo @KingJames Wrong. Had a year left on his current deal (due $6M for 2018-19).
I get the frustration of 10 straight playoff losses to @KingJames. Raptors got schooled by Cleveland &amp; Casey made mistakes. But he‚Äôs not the only reason they got beat, yet he‚Äôs the only guy out of a job at present. Again: LeBron has beaten EVERYBODY in the east for seven years!
Not sure who‚Äôs out there who would have done much better given DeRozan‚Äôs/Ibaka‚Äôs major struggles vs. Cavs. Raptors do have strong in-house candidates in assistant coach Nick Nurse and Raptors 905 (G League) head coach Jerry Stackhouse.
Raptors announce firing of Dwane Casey. A damn shame after such an incredible regular season. He won‚Äôt be out of work long if he chooses to jump back in.

Wolves go to playoffs for the first time since '04. #BAHGAWD #THATSTHIBSMUSIC https://t.co/x8No1ls3XU via @GIPHY https://t.co/NFO8bB21dI
Wolves up four after two Wiggins free throws with 14.6 left in OT.
Wizards fall in Orlando, will finish eighth in east and play Toronto. Miami up six over Raptors in OT; if Heat hold on, Miami finishes sixth and plays Philly, while the Bucks, who lost to theSixers by a trillion tonight, would finish seventh and play Boston in the first round.
Meanwhile, Wizards about to lose to another bad team, down 10 to Orlando with 1:24 left. If they lose they play Toronto in the first round.
Crawford misses a 40-footer at the buzzer; overtime in Minnesota between the Wolves and Nuggets, tied at 101, for the last playoff spot in the west.
Taj Gibson rips Nikola Jokic and comes up with the steal and timeout. Now it‚Äôs Minnesota ball with 1.6 seconds left.
Nuggets ball after a Butler miss. Still tied at 101 with 4.4 seconds left in regulation.
Wolves 101, Nuggets 101. Two minutes left.
@EdwinGutierrez @NBATV Fifteen teams have clinched a playoff spot. The winner of Wolves-Nuggets will get the 16th‚Äîand, last‚Äîplayoff spot.
While more than a third of the league is, uh, positioning itself either for the playoffs or the Lottery, the Nuggets and Wolves are grinding for the last postseason spot. Minny up 84-79 late in the third. Tune in NOW on @NBATV to see the finish!
@russwest44 gets his 16th rebound of the game against Memphis, will average a triple-double for the second straight season.
@T_Rozzay3 told me Tuesday it was "disrespectful" when he hears teams want to play the @celtics in the first round... https://t.co/xFxkQsKDgd

Andre Ingram, @AmericanU is so, so proud of you!! Thank you for showing the world what it means to never give up and keep grinding! 19 points, 3 rebounds and 3 blocks in your NBA debut‚Äîunbelievable!! @AU_MBasketball #onceaneagle
Are you kidding me?? Andre Ingram, from @AU_MBasketball, after 10 years in the G League, is 5 of 7 from the floor and 3 of 4 on threes, and has 16 points and 3 boards for the @Lakers against Houston. Tune in NOW to @NBAonTNT!!
Scott Brooks said Otto Porter‚Äôs calf tightened up in the first half, and with the playoffs coming up the Wizards didn‚Äôt want to take any chances.
Sixers win 15th straight, setting franchise record for consecutive wins. Will lock down third place in the east with a win at home on Wednesday against Milwaukee.
Wizards starting @KELLYOUBREJR in second half with Otto Porter out for the rest of the game‚Äîright lower leg strain.

Denver beats Portland to get to 46-35, same record as Minnesota, which also won tonight. If Pels beat Clips tonight, they reach 47 wins and are in, leaving last playoff spot in the West for the winner of Nuggets at Wolves Wednesday.
Took much longer than normal this season, but Spurs clinch playoff spot with comeback win over Sacramento. Twenty-one straight years in the postseason.
OKC clinches playoff spot with win in Miami. Heat will fall to seventh in east after Bucks finish win over Magic; Milwaukee goes to sixth, finishes regular season Wednesday at Philly, which will also have something to play for (potential clinch of third in the east).
To keep control of the team from two minority owners who sought it, Steve Kaplan and Daniel Straus, Pera had to commit to either buying their shares of the team at a valuation price set by them, or sell his shares of the team at that price. Pera chose the former.

76ers beat Dallas in Sunday matinee; clinch home court in first round, now a game ahead of fourth-place Cleveland in the east. Sixers will clinch third place with wins over Hawks, Bucks in last two games.
Spurs beat Portland to match OKC, New Orleans wins tonight, and the Blazers‚Äô losing to SA opens a path for Utah to the number three seed in the west if the Jazz win its last three games (at LAL Sunday, home vs. Dubs Tuesday, at Portland Wednesday).
Thunder, Pelicans with enormous road wins to reach the verge of postseason clinches.
Huge steal from Rondo in a one-on-one with Durant, leading to Moore basket; Pelicans up four at GSW with 23.5 seconds left.

@michaelgrange @TimBontemps Again: not saying it‚Äôs bigger, or different. Saying it‚Äôs real.
@michaelgrange @TimBontemps I didn‚Äôt say more stressful. I said that those of us on the outside have no idea what they‚Äôre dealing with every day, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre coaching a good team or a bad one. And those who would dismiss those stresses b/c they get paid a lot are way wrong.
As someone who deals with insomnia on a (too) regular basis‚Ä¶lack of sleep is no joke. It‚Äôs debilitating. It‚Äôs a major stress indicator. And it‚Äôs hard to explain the impact on you to people who do sleep well. And I have about 1/1,000,000th of the stress of a typical NBA coach.

No ACL tear for @JimmyButler but out indefinitely with meniscus injury, per team.

Rockets have been, and are, very interested in Joe Johnson as a potential add, and have been working on the assumption that he‚Äôd be available one way or the other after trade deadline, per source.
Joe Johnson will seek a buyout from Sacramento after going to the Kings in three-team deal Thursday, per source. He goes to the top of the list of playoff teams as a pre-March 1 signing (postseason eligible) once that is executed.
Rockets obviously not doing anything big, but could tinker around the margins with a small deadline deal‚Ä¶.
Grizz have had second-round pick offers for Tyreke Evans for weeks now. Have half an hour to decide whether they‚Äôll take them.

Detroit would be sending a future second round pick to New Orleans in potential Brice Johnson for Dante Cunningham deal, per source. Wolves also potential Cunningham destination if Pistons deal doesn‚Äôt get completed.

Clips and agent Wallace Prather moved swiftly to get deal done. Williams knows this season (34 mins/game) is an outlier to his career, and is comfortable with the team‚Äôs direction post @blakegriffin23 trade.
For @TeamLou23, staying in one place after bouncing from the Lakers to Houston to the Clips in the last year was more important than chasing more potential Bucks this summer in Philly, Phoenix or other spots. Three years, partial guarantee on third to stay with LAC.

Again, Cleveland‚Äîmaybe‚Äîmight be willing to talk about that kind of deal for Jordan after this year, if it placated LeBron &amp; Cavs didn‚Äôt have to surrender Brooklyn pick as part of a deal with the Clippers. But so far, they‚Äôve been unwilling to include the Nets‚Äô pick.
Jordan hired Jeff Schwartz‚Äîperhaps the most powerful agent in the NBA‚Äîlast year. You generally don‚Äôt do that if you‚Äôre just going to opt in next summer rather than opt out and seek a max/near max contract.
Wizards‚Äô interest in @DeAndre, like almost every other team‚Äîmaybe not the Cavs‚Äîwould be predicated on him opting in for 2018-19 ($24.1M) rather than opting out to become UFA. From what I‚Äôve heard thus far, Jordan has given no indication to anyone that he‚Äôd be willing to do that. https://t.co/vEcaKj3mEV

Assuming Bulls do waive @aa000G9, the Grindfather will be in high demand by playoff teams that need a perimeter stopper once he fully recovers from fibula fracture. Would certainly make sense for OKC/Houston.
Pels had to pick up Mirotic's option for 2018-19 ($12.5M) to facilitate the trade; otherwise, Mirotic would be a free agent after this year. Moving Allen and Nelson creates a roster spot for potential Greg Monroe pursuit.
Bulls still not 100 percent sure about waiving both Allen and Nelson, per source, but certainly seems likely. Will definitely keep Asik.
First-round pick the Pelicans are sending Chicago in Mirotic trade is protected 1-5 in 2018, per source, with gradual easing of protections in subsequent years.
Add Spurs, Wizards to growing list of playoff teams interested in Greg Monroe post-waivers. Celtics and Pelicans among others.
Celtics obvious potential target for Greg Monroe post-buyout. Cavs have been on the hunt for a big man before the trade deadline as well.

Meanwhile, Wizards know what Wall‚Äôs loss means to short term, but remain determined to keep their 2018 first-round pick after dealing their firsts in three of the previous four years to fill holes on roster. A trade this year would have to involve a star, not a role player.
Told @JohnWall had the option for ‚Äúclean-up‚Äù procedure (@CandaceDBuckner first) on knee earlier but opted for PRP treatment in hopes he could get thru the rest of the season afterward. Still wants to play now, but ‚Äúat some point you have to be realistic,‚Äù per source.

Clips/Williams also still exploring extension, which would not preclude LAC nonetheless dealing him by deadline; he could be more attractive to other teams on a reasonable multi-year deal (potential cost certainty in ‚Äô18, ‚Äô19) than if he becomes UFA this summer.
Cavs definitely have asked about @TeamLou23, as @TheSteinLine reported. But told this week that talks so far have stalled on Clips‚Äô request 4 Brooklyn pick.
Cavs led by 23 at home. Magic now lead by one with 31.5 seconds left. This would be exceptionally bad for Cleveland to lose.
@HPbasketball Yup.
@Schwiggler9 Which one? https://t.co/OKZmfgN5tq
@laker72289 I agree. Completely.
Reminder, per league: Each captain‚Äôs first four selections must come from the pool of eight remaining starters.  As the top overall finisher in fan voting, James will make the first pick.‚Äù  Who would you take?

Roberts: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot of conversation, but it‚Äôs not at the same time, in the same room, with the people that need to be there."
Silver said he thinks that having the officials and players in a room together will start to thaw some of the mistrust between the two, just as he and Roberts built their relationship over the last two years during constant face to face discussions/dialogue.

@scfehr1 @ByKimberleyA In its own way. Beat you to it, grammar cops! :-)
@scfehr1 @ByKimberleyA I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but I never thought about a team I covered being a stepping stone to something ‚Äúbigger.‚Äù It was just my beat, until the next one. I covered one winning team in nine years on various beats, and each of them was fascinating and exciting in their own way.
@arch_laboratory @MGortat Good luck!
@tangent171 @ByKimberleyA Well, I covered them before he got there, but the point is well-taken. :-)
@ByKimberleyA Hard for folks to understand that you check your fandom at the door if you‚Äôre serious about the work and want to serve THEM‚Äîthe readers‚Äîin the best manner possible. I grew up in D.C. LOVED the team. But that stopped when I walked into Redskins Park to cover them. Not hard to do.

@mariecbaca Uh, excuse me? Peanut M&amp;Ms are the PREMIER vending machine item. :-)
Source confirms season-ending knee surgery for Thabo Sefolosha is likely (@ShamsCharania first), but final decision to be made next week. Would be tough blow for Jazz; Sefolosha was shooting 49 from the floor and 38 from three this season. Injured knee vs. Charlotte on Friday.
And, he added, if the results of the Lottery produced the same in-order result as the regular season standings.
Lakers win 4th straight w/OT win at Dallas; now have sixth-worst mark (15-27) in the NBA. If that held the rest of the season, L.A.‚Äôs 2018 first would convey to Philly (who gets the Lakers‚Äô pick if it‚Äôs first overall or between 6-30) rather than Boston (picks 2-5).
@mlombardiNFL Thought the same thing. At least three points!
@AschNBA @WarriorsPR Thirded, if that‚Äôs a word. (It isn‚Äôt? I just made up a word? Cool. :-))
Would definitely expect several good/playoff contenders to check on Ramon Sessions, waived today by the Knicks. Just 31 with a lot of good basketball left in him.

@PUBLISIDE @Trykeman @mikefreemanNFL My wife and her family are from rural Wisconsin. And they do not sit at the bar and speak with prejudice and hate in their hearts toward people of different races.

My wife is from Wisconsin. Most of her family still lives in Wisconsin. I‚Äôve been in bars with them in Wisconsin. They do not believe what the current president said about Haitians &amp; immigrants, @JesseBWatters. They are good and fair-minded people. You do not speak for them.
No game in January means anything in June. But this is not the same iso ball Toronto team that Cleveland throttled in the playoffs the past few years. The Cavs might improve defensively, but the Raptors have many more ways to score than in the past. Much tougher out this year.

Now, because they had to chase that extra point, a field goal beats them. Just odd to me.

@bluejayscentre I get that. It‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs so much time left in the game.

The renovated Key Arena would seat 18,350 for NBA games, 17,150 for NHL games and up to 19,100 for concerts.
The vote puts the Seattle city government squarely behind OVG, headed by longtime sports executive/AEG CEO Tim Leiweke &amp; entertainment manager/mogul Irving Azoff, instead of billionaire Chris Hansen, who has sought to build an arena in the South Downtown section of the city.
Seattle‚Äôs City Council passes a Memorandum of Understanding between the city and the Oak View Group, allowing for a proposed $650M renovation of Key Arena &amp; Seattle Center by OVG that would produce an NBA/NHL ready building by 2020.

@TMatich @BMitchliveNBCS @CHICKatNBCS You and BMitch never lied, Trevor. It‚Äôs one thing to ‚Äúpull the punch‚Äù when you‚Äôre writing or talking about high school kids or college kids. They‚Äôre kids. But this is Big Boy Sports. They‚Äôre getting paid to perform. For them to say they brought the right effort is delusional.
@sugruejohn @godin_joe ‚ÄòCause no one else in football has injuries in Week 13 of the season.
@sugruejohn @godin_joe Good Lord, stop being dense. I‚Äôm talking about the excuses being made for losing by 24 points to a 5-6 team that had lost three straight and scored 22 points total in 3 weeks. But you keep talking about the poor, beat up home team.
At least @BMitchliveNBCS, @TMatich and @CHICKatNBCS brought it postgame. No BS, no excuses. Told the truth. Good for them.
The delusion/excuse making of the fan base in this city continues to amaze.
@godin_joe Was their 2016 first-rounder (Doctson) playing? Was their leading receiver this year (Crowder) playing? Keep making excuses for getting boatraced by a team that had scored 22 points total the previous three games. This team lives off of that.
@godin_joe No parity in 1987?  49ers 13-2 Saints 12-3 Bears 11-4 Washington 11-4  They won the Super Bowl with their backup quarterback (Doug Williams), and with their third-string RB (Timmy Smith) starting. Stop making excuses. Everyone has injuries, every year, at almost every position.
@godin_joe ‚ÄúMark May, a starting tackle, missed the first two games....Russ Grimm, the starting center, missed much of the season w/an injured knee. Ed Simmons, a rookie, played left guard and right tackle...Jeff Bostic moved from center to guard to center.‚Äù  They made, &amp; won, SB XXII.
@VABorn817 I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad coach, and they have had a ton of injuries‚Ä¶but this happens too often in big games.
You tell me if that team was ready to play football tonight.
Getting steamrolled by a one-dimensional offense that‚Äôs scored 22 points its previous three games. SMH.
Because of Washington‚Äôs awful first half, Cowboys can stay on the ground behind their excellent O-line instead of having to throw with a QB with a swollen hand.
Great step and throw from Cousins on third down.
Let‚Äôs see if that score before the half woke them up.
@roythagard Yeah, but they both played on Thanksgiving. Both had a week off.
You don‚Äôt play this bad unless you thought you had the game won before kickoff. That‚Äôs what I mean by arrogant.
Arrogant.
Looks like a puffed-up, arrogant team that thought it would just show up and beat a bad Dallas squad.
That kick was going out of bounds. Another error.
@cadillaccannon Can‚Äôt argue.
Washington wasted field position, scoring opportunities. That‚Äôs a quarter win for Dallas even though there‚Äôs no score.
Have a seat, Jamison.
That‚Äôs on Crowder. Bad INT in red zone.
Cavs announce @imanshumpert will have arthroscopic surgery on left knee Friday. Timetable for his return will be determined after surgery.
Am I nuts, or was there some slight quake-like shaking in D.C. just now?
Magic say Terrence Ross out indefinitely after spraining right MCL and suffering non-displaced fracture of R tibial plateau Wednesday against OKC. Will be out a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù amount of time.

The point, which some of you are late to, is that managers don‚Äôt play. They aren‚Äôt smarter or dumber b/c of what their guys do or don‚Äôt do.

I like your team &amp; I want it to do well, &amp; I hope the next guy gets you over the hump. I just don‚Äôt buy that what one guy does&gt;25 guys do.
‚Ä¶But maybe, you should look at the players you brought in &amp; hold them accountable for not hitting/fielding/pitching when it counts most...
‚Ä¶Hey, it‚Äôs your team. You can do what you want. But hiring a seventh manager in 14 years says more about you than the guy you just let go.
‚Ä¶&amp; the manager who averaged 96 wins in 2 yrs &amp; kept your franchise from being a laughingstock is the guy who gets fired...
And, finally, the top of the order can‚Äôt get a hit vs. a closer in his THIRD inning of relief, &amp; the star OF strikes out to end the game‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶then the LF loses a ball in the lights to allow another run, then the backup catcher gets picked off first to kill an 8th inning rally...
‚Ä¶but the ace‚Äôs performance is topped by the catcher‚Äôs, who allows a dropped 3rd strike to get away, then throws it away, then commits CI...
And gets G5 at home, &amp; leads 4-1 after 2, but the starter only can go 3, &amp; the ace of the staff comes in &amp; gives up four in one inning...
‚Ä¶And the guy‚Äôs team gets shut out in G1, and scores 1 run in G3, &amp; loses G3 when a pop up falls in between 3 fielders in the eighth...
So a guy averages 96 wins in 2 years &amp; wins 2 division titles and stabilizes a team after its closer had choked its superstar in public...

A great ball by Cousins; gave Doctson a chance. Couldn‚Äôt control it all the way down.
Huge plays by Cousins in clutch. Can he and the OL finish the drive?
Hunt‚Äôs vision‚Ä¶unbelievable. Great young back.
@jazapfsp @MarkBullockNFL Yes, he did. As I said, an easy toss that he fumbled. But don‚Äôt like the call, either after he‚Äôs gotten a rhythm going off tackle.

JR/Jae/LBJ/Love starting w/Rose would max spacing and switching, allowing Wade to lead second unit w/Shump/Korver, Thompson, etc.

As for OKC, I'd say Oladipo/Sabonis/Kanter/McDermott and a second for @Yg_Trece &amp; @carmeloanthony is a pretty solid offseason...
Despite PJax firing, Knicks thought there was still distance between Melo/team they couldn't close. The desire 4 fresh start was strong.
Knicks also achieve desire to get Anthony out of Eastern Conference, an impediment to potential deal w/Cavs.
As reported this am, Knicks wanted scoring/short contracts back for Melo &amp; got it in Kanter, who has one year + player option for '18-'19.

Kerr said Friday the team hadn‚Äôt decided what to do as a group if it were invited.
The Warriors, from Steve Kerr to Kevin Durant, had already been pretty clear that they weren‚Äôt going to go to WH if invited anyway.
Curry said at GS media day Friday: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go‚Ä¶that‚Äôs kind of the nucleus of my belief."

@CJMcCollum I do &amp; you know we got those PL ties. And: I‚Äôd LOVE for NBA players to rank the top 100 reporters!! Please get me in the top 10.
@SnottieDrippen @CJMcCollum True. But I get slighted every day of my life for what I say and write. I only care about it if it comes from people I respect.
@Ben_Dowsett @CJMcCollum Amateur players is what I meant. So I don‚Äôt understand why pros would care about their opinions. And this is not a hot take. Serious.
@CJMcCollum But, CJ: y‚Äôall know who can ball and who can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs my point. You play professionally. Why would any amateurs‚Äô opinions matter?
@C_BB7 @CJMcCollum Carmelo Anthony‚Äôs brand is not impacted one scintilla by where he‚Äôs ‚Äúranked‚Äù by a sports network.
@DawgsWillHunt @CJMcCollum 1) This impacts no serious person‚Äôs perception of NBA players. 2) Last two summers completely belie any argument on impacting ‚Äúbottom line."

@NateTidwell86 @timkawakami That‚Äôs what I mean‚ÄîI do think there are more good QB coaches out there than there were back in the ‚Äò90s, but not as many as people think.
@timkawakami so few people actually knew anything about what playing it well entailed. I think that‚Äôs changed  some, but not by much. (2/2)
so few people actually knew anything about what playing it well entailed. I think that‚Äôs changed  some, but not by much. (2/2)
@timkawakami I remember, in another life, Sonny Jurgensen‚Äîa fairly good quarterback, yes?‚Äîsaying QB was the worst-coached position in football, b/c (1/2)

@Super70sSports Let‚Äôs not even get into the clear ostracizing of Enrico Palazzo:   https://t.co/aOiuwO5rnM
They were also talking to Mavs about QP, per source: https://t.co/PLNUVRDnN8
Per sources, Bucks likely to stretch Spencer Hawes, but Pelicans won't stretch Omer Asik. Today is deadline to use stretch for 2017-18 cap.
And when I say ‚Äúpay,‚Äù I just mean that‚Äôs the amount that would be on the cap.
But if they stretch him after today, they‚Äôd pay the $7.3M he‚Äôs due this year, then stretch the remaining $17.7M over the next 5 yrs (2/2)
Example: team wants to cut player w/3 yrs/25M left, with $7.3M this year. If they stretch him today they‚Äôd pay $3.57M per next 7 yrs (1/2)
Today is the deadline for teams to use stretch provision on contracts (2X remaining years +1) to include 2017-18 season.

Per league: "The investigation did not reveal evidence of an agreement or understanding that the Lakers would sign or acquire Mr. George."
Predictable ‚Äúthat‚Äôs nothing!‚Äù Tweets to follow from Twitterari who don‚Äôt have to come out of their pockets for it...

Whoa. NBA fines Lakers $500,000 for violating anti-tampering rules in Paul George case.
@CharlesPPierce At first glance I read ‚ÄúGilbert Gottfried‚Äù and ‚ÄúMatt McGroin."
With the Kyrie deal finally official, the Cavs move up in the offseason rankings https://t.co/tVGVJ2H4TO.
@NBABeau And the last (60th) pick of the 2011 Draft was‚Ä¶who again?
@KevorkMountain What do you think is more likely‚Äî34 yo Altman decides unilaterally to blow up deal, or ownership demands more after Cavs‚Äô IT exam? Come on.
@WillHar18196474 No, it won‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt know where y‚Äôall are getting that from. GMs don‚Äôt freelance; they do what their owners want. Everyone in NBA knows that.
Lot of noise about Cavs holding out, but they got an extra pick on top of IT, Crowder, Zizic &amp; BKN pick, w no leverage. Altman did well.
Cavaliers valued Brooklyn ‚Äô18 pick too much to potentially blow up deal w/ Boston. Question now is how long Thomas will be out.
@mikefreemanNFL @AaronRodgers12 @minakimes @Kaepernick7 Well, what would he know about playing the position of quarterback in the NFL? #iknowkaepcantplay #frommycouch

When it takes that long for a first-team offense to score against backups, the touchdown should only be four points.
@CHICKatCSN Brutal.

@AU_MBasketball @BillyStone @auhoopspodcast @NBA @NHL @NCAA Not a fan of it as a standalone stat b/c it's difficult IMHO to separate impact of players who play most minutes w/one another.
Meanwhile, first overall pick @MarkelleF &amp; the 76ers are on national TV 23 times: 5 games on @NBAonTNT &amp; 9 games apiece on @NBATV &amp; ESPN.
And, the Cavaliers will be on national TV 39 times next season: 12 times on @NBAonTNT, 12 on @NBATV, 10 on ESPN and five on ABC.
Meanwhile, the Warriors will be on national TV 40 (!) times: 10 on @NBAonTNT, 11 on @NBATV, 13 times on ESPN and six times on ABC.
@ZO2_ Effect: Lakers will be on national TV a whopping 35 times this season: 11 games on @NBAonTNT, 12 on @NBATV, 11 on ESPN &amp; 1 on ABC.
The NBA has also ‚Äúprotected‚Äù 22 national TV games: neither team will be playing on a back to back, or a fifth game in seven nights.
For the first time, the NBA has eliminated ALL stretches of four games in five nights for every team. There were 70 sets as late as ‚Äô14-‚Äô15.
