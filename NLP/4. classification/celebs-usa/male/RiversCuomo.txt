Poor guy. It‚Äôs no fun to be called irrelevant.
I mean even if the numbers are actually good inside the camp, he‚Äôs got to be aware of the ol‚Äô backlash and focusing on that.
He must be hurting immeasurably.
@TopherMFord @marcmaron @WTFpod context?
I loved that melody when I was kid. "So, she says its time she goes / but wanted to be sure I know / she hopes we can be friends"
"What if I were Romeo in black jeans / what if I was Heathcliff, its no myth" Those are some tough lyrics. But he made it fly. Good for him.
@jose_madero es bueno. yo lo promeso:)

Someone once thought my dad was Al Pacino as he was coming out of a theater, just having seen the Godfather. That must have been like 1971.
‚ÄúIf you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you prick us do we not bleed?‚Äù So awesome. Gotta love Pacino.
Al Pacino was the bomb in ‚ÄúMerchant of Venice‚Äù.
BTW, whatever happened to that Al Pacino King Lear that was supposed to come out in 2013? So bummed.
Thinking about going up to see a performance of king lear at the theatricum botanicum in Topanga canyon. Anybody ever been?

Pretty much every show makes a pilot before it goes on the air. Only 1 in 100 goes on 2 become a regular show.
I think someone from FOX jumped the gun w/their press release. From what I understand, a "put pilot" means they *might* make a pilot.

@danielbrummel FRIENDS OF P was awesome!
Impromptu hootenanny in the ship's library last night. I was surprised so many people knew all the lyrics to "Ice Ice Baby."
That was a happy, happy experience. Thanks, everybody. #weezercruise
@CherrieT Thanks!
@CherrieT Did u guys have dinner already? I'm still on California time.
@CherrieT soccer was too crazy!
Wow, man, people are taking "80's Prom Night" seriously. I gotta step up my game, wardrobe-wise. #weezercruise
Just went snorkeling with some fans. Had to change into my suit in front of some Weezer-bros.
Weezer Cruise update: I just did a reading from "The Pinkerton Diaries" and a Q&A with the fans.
Just boarded the ship :)  Have everything from "Gilligan's Island" to "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" in my head.
Just landed in Miami. Weezer Cruise starts tomorrow. Stoked!
@maura you're welcome and thank YOU!
