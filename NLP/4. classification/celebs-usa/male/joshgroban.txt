Eventually as if by magic he just randomly ran out from behind a bush. He had gotten scared and ran off and was still close but hiding and then came out. Anyway....big night of emotions. The next year I stayed for the whole party. üëçüèªüê∂
My assistant said ‚Äúwe gotta get in the car I‚Äôll explain but we gotta leave now.‚Äù It was then I found out my dog Sweeney had gotten lost. Anyone who knows me knows that he‚Äôs my fur child and I was beside myself. We scanned the neighborhood for what seemed like an eternity...
Another reason I‚Äôll never forget that night is because it was stress then amazing then stress again. Getting the call from Clive last minute was of course nerve wracking but then the song went great, I was thrilled. Until I stepped foot off stage...

All Trump ad-libs during a speech are directed towards his own way of learning things, not everyone else‚Äôs.

@jonnysun Yours too my friend!
If my last two tweets are your line in the sand as to whether you can enjoy my singing voice, I‚Äôm at peace with that.
@BillEager1 To be honest bill I didn‚Äôt know about it if that‚Äôs true. And yes I would be. The public is being made aware of what‚Äôs happening currently and to say ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt get mad then when you didn‚Äôt know so why get mad now when you do‚Äù is an argument completely besides the point.
Anyone tweeting me ‚Äúbut their parents...‚Äù shhh. Stop. Nope. We don‚Äôt do this to children and families. I don‚Äôt care the circumstances I really don‚Äôt and neither should you. We figure it out. But we don‚Äôt do this. 10,000. This is a disgrace. https://t.co/yVHdXeTquJ

Anyway I‚Äôm off to shoot, I‚Äôll read your responses when I take my phone out of the time capsule I‚Äôm about to put it in.
My previous tweet about regulating news was a poor choice of words. Free press, always. 1st amendment, always. So what is it? Why are we all so angry and think we know 180 opposite ‚Äúfacts‚Äù? Is it not dangerous what‚Äôs happening? Discuss! Or don‚Äôt! I had a donut too.
@LouisPeitzman Yes please just drop them off in my doomsday pantry. Have a safe flight!
@EweBeWitty Tv is already regulated. Maybe the same fines that get sent for, say, a curse word or nudity can be applied for...lies? At the moment there is zero repercussion for knowingly sending out misleading or untrue information as news.
@ArtSchnurple @ProudDemocrat1 Totally true. Not the solution. It‚Äôs complicated. But I think my frustration with how cable news is dividing us is not unfounded.
@LouisPeitzman Hi Louis
I‚Äôm caffeinated and fired up and shooting for 13 hours on a Saturday and whoooooo boy
Maybe say ‚ÄúBreaking Opinion‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúBreaking News‚Äù if something is obviously the former and not the cold hard boring but accurate latter. Not silencing anything, just rephrasing how it‚Äôs presented. https://t.co/a7vfRufzkB
I understand the slippery slope. Not the solution either obviously. But I think people know what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs irresponsible what‚Äôs happening and eating at the soul of our country. https://t.co/RjKa1PcSPT
I‚Äôm becoming increasingly disturbed by how, depending on the cable news channel, the news is presented in COMPLETELY different ways. This should be illegal and regulated. And shows that are about the host‚Äôs opinions should be labeled as opinion shows before they air as news.

It‚Äôs not wrong that he‚Äôs doing it. It‚Äôs tradition and beautiful to honor these extraordinary individuals. It‚Äôs his internalizing. And I wish he would include a victim of (and denounce) white nationalism as well. Ok night night shows over!
It‚Äôs a complicated emotion to both be deeply moved by those Trump is calling out and deeply perturbed by why he‚Äôs doing it.
I‚Äôll give him this when he‚Äôs bored and sleepy he‚Äôs very soothing. Right this second if he just pivoted to Goodnight Moon I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at it.
A 90 minute standing ovation for these incredible guests of honor would be better for country morale

I really don‚Äôt like politics.
I just love when he goes off script and freewheels with one of his own adjectives. It‚Äôs thrilling.
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs bipartisan tradition, all these standing ovations (except for those honored) are dumb.

Ok last thing after The Blind Side (the feeeeelz) I watched Score about film composers. Loved it. Always been a dream to compose for a film but terrifying because as the film demonstrates, you have to find the muse within a sea of directives and visual cues. K bye!

It‚Äôs one of the reasons streaming is so great. It‚Äôs stream of consciousness listening too. What to choose next. An old song you remembered made you a fan to begin with, instantly after a new one. Filling up the creative tank instantly. ‚ÄúI know Kung fu‚Äù.
Sometimes when you think about music and make music all day for a living you gotta remind yourself how to zone out, tune in, and be a fan again. Every so often. Maybe it‚Äôs the same for actors and films.
Making playlists for people is a great way to remember how much you love listening to music

lt‚Äôs scary to put yourself out there. To try new things. Sometimes people aren‚Äôt gonna get it, or want it. Sometimes they‚Äôll be mean. But in the end it‚Äôs the only way to live a personally and creatively vital life. Random thought o‚Äô the day.

@ditzkoff This is a really good one Dave
@CharlesMcNulty Thanks Charles. These days ‚Äúright‚Äù feels so maddeningly subjective. And to scroll is to self-abuse. It‚Äôs a mental health thing.
They say don‚Äôt go to bed angry. I‚Äôm tired of the news making me angry. I‚Äôm tired of twitter fueling anger back and forth. It‚Äôs toxic.
@AudraEqualityMc @60Minutes Right????
@curlygirl990 @nrsnnc Right. Me too. But the amount of guns being sold easily legally and illegally are both a problem right now.
@AriSchulman lf you genuinely think that was the thought behind this tweet then your cynicism disgusts me.
@curlygirl990 ‚ÄúThank goodness for guns! They sure did stop that man after he killed 26 people including children!‚Äù yeehaw.
@brianstelter @juliettekayyem @CNN Yup.
Please tell me you are watching brilliant 12 year old Alma on @60Minutes. Chills. Hope. Art. Much needed on this sorrowful night.

@bicyclefish12 @BillEager1 üòÇüò≠
@LuciusCoverdale See we already agree. Good trained people should be able to have guns. How many owners of the 300 million guns in this country are ya think?
@BillEager1 l got nothing in response to someone questioning my intelligence who can‚Äôt spell. Correct. Take care.
@BillEager1 You‚Äôre*
And let‚Äôs cut now to our president who will console us during ah nope he opened with a joke and is now reading a paper.
@LuciusCoverdale K well you pray, and l‚Äôll ask for better laws and between the two of us hopefully guns will disappear and we can BOTH take credit, cool?
@Mark_Price_GA l‚Äôm not a senator. But if you wanna get on the twitter-no-action argument maybe direct your annoyance at POTUS?
@AudraEqualityMc And l know how tired we both are of singing it üíî
Prayers are what the victims were doing. If you respond to these attacks with prayers but no action, you are protecting the next murderer.
Just nothing. No words. Numb. Again. May everyone affected in Texas rest in and find peace.

@tanajam Isn't "anti trump jerk" an oxymoron? Like jumbo shrimp.
@Timpanist @DJ4JG State lines are invisible. Guns cross. Unless there is a national crack down, examples like this will always be fuel for the right.
@Timpanist @falconsview My terminology was wrong. My point is 100% the same.
@torigochenouer This entire dialogue is in the spirit of keeping this from happening again. That's all. Thank you for having it with me.
@torigochenouer I understand. It is so hard.
@torigochenouer And I say all of this with all respect and gratitude in the world for what you do and what your city has been through. You asked.
@torigochenouer What I don't understand is the active protest against trying
@torigochenouer If yours and others argument is what's the point then fine! Let's SEE! Maybe you'll be right maybe you'll be surprised.
@torigochenouer Because I choose trying over cynicism. I choose proactivity over defeatism. I also see it's worked in other countries. I choose not nothing.
@MichaeIDevine I misspoke, I assumed machine gun also meant semi. We agree, still nuts.
@torigochenouer Mourning and strategizing aren't mutually exclusive. I mourn the dead. I also honor them AND future potential victims in wanting change.
In this very heated debate, thank you all for your reasoned duel sided answers to these tweets without trolling. ü§òüèª
@falconsview In other words: NRA's worst nightmare. I myself am the opposite of relieved at what happened. It should have not happened at all.
@curlyheckler You literally can't say that after a man with huge collection rains down on innocents. Again. And again.
@falconsview ...knowing that in doing so it may save others lives. That in enjoying such loose gun laws, many are actually at risk at all times.
@falconsview Every time a nutcase does this, many die. So is it worth it to the good guys to limit their own access to guns....
@falconsview I'm not saying that he wasn't a lone crazy person. Or that there aren't thousands of responsible gun owners of semis. My question is this:
@falconsview From what I have seen, he may very well have modified his semi using a legal bump-stock. He also had just so many semis. Again, why?
@DJ4JG It is something. Instead of nothing. Isn't that what making America great is all about? Trying? Not simply shrugging our shoulders?
@DJ4JG It is so easy to be defeatist I know. So many guns already. But the stats of other countries who HAVE made stricter laws don't lie.
@falconsview Then pardon my wrong terminology. I thought a semi-automatic was a machine gun. Semantics.
@TheMikeKehoe Sure! But laws are to protect the whole not the few. Some people might find beauty in collecting murder victims. Sorry pal not allowed!
@falconsview If I am I'd be delighted but it doesn't seem to be the case from all I've read
@falconsview Are semi automatic machine guns hard to get? I genuinely believe they are not hard to get in America. Gun shows. Mail. Walmart. Am I wrong?
@TheMikeKehoe I guess you could be a bomb collector. A poison collector. Just saying to collect a thing built to kill, what does that say about collector?
Anyway...I think we're all up late right now trying to reason. Figure out this division. See both sides. Find a solution. Save lives. Night!
I'm not talking hunting rifles. Pistols. General protection or sport. I'm talking machine gun collectors and the legality of that. Just why.
It is a power thing. People feel powerful with them. Owning them. Shooting them. "They want to take my power away". https://t.co/gfIzVHExxj
I'm not being glib. This is a part of the conversation that needs to be had. Culturally. There is a fear problem. A misinformation problem.
What are the chances really. Mathematically. That you will NEED your insane machine gun collection vs the chances innocents will die
Here's a stat I'm genuinely interested in: number of people wrongly murdered by guns a year vs those killed in the name of defense legally

Not equating the two. Just....what a shitty day. Going back on my walk.
What a horrid day for our country, music fans and music itself. RIP Tom Petty. His songs are always good medicine. Love to his family.
Alright I'm going for a walk. We're all full of sorrow today. I also want to give a huge thank you to the LVPD and first responders.
The sad thing is, those defending guns &amp; those pushing to limit them all WANT the same thing: Keep peace. End killing. Have this talk. Fix.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman In many cases and places that is correct yes. Not nearly as tough and complete as it should be.
@cylon8 @joshgrobanfan01 @SarahKSilverman They don't. They really don't. I'm telling you, we want the same thing. And there is a problem currently that you aren't recognizing.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Wrong. A responsible educated and restricted populous. The current laws are an absolute free for all in the name of profit. Period.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Wake up call: us liberal clowns? We want *only* responsible owners to be able to purchase them. This isn't complicated.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman So you go cling to the fears and ignorance that the NRA depend so dearly on to continue making a blood soaked profit. I'm just not engaging.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman All gun violence is bad. Against concert goers. Against children. All bad. The difference between us is you want to do nothing about it.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Must be quiet and blissful in the ignorance of Trollville. Bye.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Ok. Keep fighting for an object invented for killing. In anyone's hands. Regardless of fitness to own such a thing. People are dying.
It's perfectly compassionate and human thing to be mad at murder and want to prevent it in the future. If you are "yeah but"ing me, pause.
@gopprincess123 The problem is the bodies shouldn't be cold to begin with because of ANOTHER SHOOTER. You all did this the last time. And the last time. And
@MegWClayton @Andreapitts48 This. Exactly.
@gopprincess123 Gun control. For civilians. Health checks. Not gun elimination. This argument's stupidity and defensiveness is why we have a problem.
I'm also filled with anger. Freedom should mean being able to go to school. Watch a concert. Gather to pray. Live in peace. #GunControlNow
I'm at a loss for words. Just pure sorrow for the victims and their families. For music fans around the country. For the city of Las Vegas.
My Las Vegas friends please stay safe, stay indoors. This is ongoing and looks already to be quite tragic.
