@OnlineAlison @sofifii @JORDANOKUN @ZaraLisbon I wish the food was better at Dive. But every 30 minutes? Bubble magic.  Honorable mentions: The original The Palm, and Islands in Westwood
Shhhh...Sleep now, publicists.
Super amazing day off in Singapore, a place I’ve never been but always wanted to tour my whole career. Check out my insta-stories. I kinda....did a lot of them. Many thanks to my @wbr   @WarnerMusicSG family for welcoming us with open arms. Can’t wait for the show tomorrow. https://t.co/gIn1bij6Qg

GAH I TOOK THE BAIT. I freakin took it. Damn it twitter. Stop pushing horse shit in our faces and pushing the “say something damn you.” button in our rapidly deteriorating mind castles. I’m going back to the kitchen it’s warm and smells good.

So exited to see you so excited about the fan club relaunch! I know I mentioned before that Monday was gonna be the club announcement. But it was ready sooner so we did it today. So Monday is gonna be an even better announcement. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’m so happy to announce the FOJG fan club is back OPEN, re-done and it is finally free for all. Get advance ticket opportunities, be part of cool contests and stream exclusive music! “River” live from Rochester is up now. Thank you for being so amazing. https://t.co/TxmnWFfEtj

Eventually as if by magic he just randomly ran out from behind a bush. He had gotten scared and ran off and was still close but hiding and then came out. Anyway....big night of emotions. The next year I stayed for the whole party. 👍🏻🐶
My assistant said “we gotta get in the car I’ll explain but we gotta leave now.” It was then I found out my dog Sweeney had gotten lost. Anyone who knows me knows that he’s my fur child and I was beside myself. We scanned the neighborhood for what seemed like an eternity...
Another reason I’ll never forget that night is because it was stress then amazing then stress again. Getting the call from Clive last minute was of course nerve wracking but then the song went great, I was thrilled. Until I stepped foot off stage...
I’ll never forget that night.  https://t.co/fExyO7JFT3

Hahaha look at all those Weiner dogs running. 10/10 good job Heinz.
I can’t watch the game or the commercials on this flight so I’ll be live tweeting commercials I remember from previous games.   Ok that puppy monkey baby is an abomination and I need it off my screen.
I’ll be on a flight during the Super Bowl so my usual zany commentary will be replaced by a deep national tension, please enjoy

Through all this chaos I have a lighthearted anticipation for the next president to reveal which secret Trump programs were going on before closing them down. Like “Operation Steel Cloud: Why Do Planes REALLY Fly” Or “The Fountain Project: How Has Dr. Ruth Been Old Since Birth”
This sh*t is 🔥. In, like, the hell way. https://t.co/TwKhNoySP5
@brianstelter Wonder what this spilt screen next to the Fox split screen looks like
Written: “Thousands of drugs are being transported over our borders...”  Ad-lib: “that’s like a mountain of candy up to my head folks. Lotta candy.”
All Trump ad-libs during a speech are directed towards his own way of learning things, not everyone else’s.
Shutting down the government shouldn’t even be allowed for any reason. This feels like non-partisan common sense for the American people. We should all be furious it happens at all.

I’m not saying it exonerates anyone. I’m saying the entire hour was more complicated than it was reported. And I value tweeting the whole thing if I responded to 1/10’th the thing. Carry on.
Important. A lot of us saw what everyone else did, the news shows events as they happen, social media responds. The truth, usually, was somewhere in the middle. Any of us who rushed to tweet about this incident should now also tweet the entire account. https://t.co/YEDg2hQpEL

Ok so....my lawyers have informed me you don’t get a gold bird pin in the mail for a million followers. In fact they said you “don’t get anything, ever.” So. I don’t know where they’re getting those bird pins. Also the drinks thing. Huh. Still sucks!
@keith_caulfield Noice
I was so close to a million followers and then twitter was like PSYCH YOUR MIND and now I’m never gonna get a golden bird pin in the mail like all my friends have. Every dang time I meet them IRL they wear that gold bird just rubbing it in and getting free drinks. Sucks. 😒
This didn’t get as many likes as I had hoped

@ErinCMathews @DKinnard I laughed remembering the review from that night saying it was such a missed opportunity that I didn’t get political on such a political night. That I played it too safe. I guess opinions are like.....politics
I really gotta stop being home and bored
@ErinCMathews @DKinnard I only see one of us lecturing if I’m honest but to each their own, be well.
@ErinCMathews https://t.co/GElSpv4Agv
@ErinCMathews Oh that was just on the night of the election. Odd evening for a concert. Context. But listen, I voted blue. You voted red. I simply mildly joked that’s the way I voted. But hey if that was enough to ignore the rest then I respect your view and wish you well.
@ErinCMathews For the listeners at home, she’s referring to a 1 minute moment when I said however you vote it’s important we treat people and especially children with empathy and respect. Apolitical. When you go to a concert, you may just get a whole person on stage. And 18 pretty songs. 👋🏻
If you’d asked me last week how much romaine I ate regularly I would have said “not much, maybe none”. I’m sorry romaine. I miss you. Get well soon.

Wishing @CHVRCHES an excellent show tonight in Nashville. We have shared a hotel, a restaurant and a bar and I’ve been too shy to tell them in person so kick ass tonight, lady and gents.

Microsoft Encarta ‘95 introduced me to the music of Frank Zappa and I’ll always be appreciative
@KTTunstall @kcrw @waynecoyne Of course!! Can’t wait to hear the whole album
@KTTunstall @kcrw @waynecoyne Listened on the radio, it was an awesome performance KT!

On this #MentalHealthAwareness day it’s so important we use social media to be there for each other. I’ve battled depression since I was a kid. I’ve worked hard the last few years to be aware of what it takes to push towards the light. It’s an uphill climb but we aren’t alone.
@DeltaRae @ashesbashes @backstreetboys Same here Ashley!! Sending love and healthy thoughts! You got thiiiiis. ❤️

What songs from Bridges do you most want to hear live on tour? If I did jungle cat illusions for vocal breaks would that be cool or too extra? Where can I get a BBQ tofu slider in Nashville? Feel free to answer none of these but at least respond with baby goat pictures
@yashar @AlexEdelman Oh iiiiinteresting. Ok. I’m pretty much with you.

Important article. Please read. https://t.co/3H1tE1XvJj
@jonnysun Yours too my friend!
If my last two tweets are your line in the sand as to whether you can enjoy my singing voice, I’m at peace with that.
@BillEager1 To be honest bill I didn’t know about it if that’s true. And yes I would be. The public is being made aware of what’s happening currently and to say “you didn’t get mad then when you didn’t know so why get mad now when you do” is an argument completely besides the point.
Anyone tweeting me “but their parents...” shhh. Stop. Nope. We don’t do this to children and families. I don’t care the circumstances I really don’t and neither should you. We figure it out. But we don’t do this. 10,000. This is a disgrace. https://t.co/yVHdXeTquJ

@23Courtney23 @pabarge @RadioCity @TheTonyAwards @SaraBareilles Because trolls don’t see details they just see huge dumb chunks of big broad loud information that makes them reach for their hammers of self righteousness they keep hung next to the spice rack and use said hammers to destroy albums they already bought.

There are two great rewards about doing a commencement address (and teaching in general): imparting the knowledge but then re-reading it to yourself and taking your own advice. Far easier to say than to continue doing and we all need reminders or we fall back into bad habits.

@rejectedjokes Thanks Ben!!! Cant wait to have dinner with you again!
@Renee_Hey Had a couple more days. Today was it.
And that’s a wrap on season 1 of #TheGoodCop. It’s been a privilege to learn every day from this cast and crew. Hope you enjoy it. Time to grow some hair back out and play music for ya’s. https://t.co/qNWlSqUALG

Far Cry 5: When Turkeys Attack
The music to Wild Wild Country is excellent
@TheMandyMoore @netflix You know I’m not mad at it
@TheMandyMoore @netflix Is it bad that before the second episode I was like “this place seems aaaaaallllriiiiight”
I sure love documentaries and Wild Wild Country on @netflix sure is a good one.
@bodybyJanine @netflix Thanks so much Janine nice to bowl with you!
Just left The Good Cop wrap party. I love this cast and crew so much. We had so much fun making this season for you and WHENEVER IT COMES OUT (hey @netflix) I hope you have fun watching it. Been a joy.
@CeliaPienkosz @Renee_Hey YEP.
Y.........................yeah. https://t.co/FDfBQLIoCp
@CeliaPienkosz @Renee_Hey TJ is tone deaf.
I buy these violent open world video games and just do what I have to do in order to get to the part where I can fly around the mountains at dusk for a while.
@Renee_Hey Tony is a wonderful singer and all around great performer! He shows off his chops on The Good Cop, promise!
I don’t know either. But good point. Look closely at the name and it will always be something slightly different. Just trust your gut if something feels off and take a closer look. https://t.co/ufhIlSq11v
Hey all, the impostors out there seem to be growing so just a word of caution, anyone pretending to be me that doesn’t have a blue check mark next to it is, well, decidedly not me. Don’t be fooled! Carry on and happy Saturday!

Anyway I’m off to shoot, I’ll read your responses when I take my phone out of the time capsule I’m about to put it in.
My previous tweet about regulating news was a poor choice of words. Free press, always. 1st amendment, always. So what is it? Why are we all so angry and think we know 180 opposite “facts”? Is it not dangerous what’s happening? Discuss! Or don’t! I had a donut too.
@LouisPeitzman Yes please just drop them off in my doomsday pantry. Have a safe flight!
@EweBeWitty Tv is already regulated. Maybe the same fines that get sent for, say, a curse word or nudity can be applied for...lies? At the moment there is zero repercussion for knowingly sending out misleading or untrue information as news.
@ArtSchnurple @ProudDemocrat1 Totally true. Not the solution. It’s complicated. But I think my frustration with how cable news is dividing us is not unfounded.
@LouisPeitzman Hi Louis
I’m caffeinated and fired up and shooting for 13 hours on a Saturday and whoooooo boy
Maybe say “Breaking Opinion” instead of “Breaking News” if something is obviously the former and not the cold hard boring but accurate latter. Not silencing anything, just rephrasing how it’s presented. https://t.co/a7vfRufzkB
I understand the slippery slope. Not the solution either obviously. But I think people know what I’m talking about. It’s irresponsible what’s happening and eating at the soul of our country. https://t.co/RjKa1PcSPT
I’m becoming increasingly disturbed by how, depending on the cable news channel, the news is presented in COMPLETELY different ways. This should be illegal and regulated. And shows that are about the host’s opinions should be labeled as opinion shows before they air as news.

It’s not wrong that he’s doing it. It’s tradition and beautiful to honor these extraordinary individuals. It’s his internalizing. And I wish he would include a victim of (and denounce) white nationalism as well. Ok night night shows over!
It’s a complicated emotion to both be deeply moved by those Trump is calling out and deeply perturbed by why he’s doing it.
I’ll give him this when he’s bored and sleepy he’s very soothing. Right this second if he just pivoted to Goodnight Moon I wouldn’t be mad at it.
A 90 minute standing ovation for these incredible guests of honor would be better for country morale
You’re losin’ em, chief
I really don’t like politics.
I just love when he goes off script and freewheels with one of his own adjectives. It’s thrilling.
I don’t care if it’s bipartisan tradition, all these standing ovations (except for those honored) are dumb.

Ok Pro Bowl question. Don’t these teams all have their own unique playbooks to memorize? How do they all come together and know the calls? Or are there tons that are pretty universal?
I wonder who holds the record for most liner note Grammys https://t.co/wp2inN10Nm

@NetflixUK Oh I’m aware! The fine print of my contract has a black mirror viewing clause!
@NetflixUK Not until The Good Cop comes out.
Yes that was sarcasm it’s a dystopian and twisted odyssey into the basement of my mind castle where it will stay until it has downloaded its dark essence fully unto my psyche I’m fine it will all be fine next episode will begin in 4...3...2...
Just finished 4 episodes of Black Mirror and holy crap what a delightful and hilarious romp of a show. Like a ray of sunshine, it tickles my senses and makes me feel #excited for the future. 😃
@NadiaBennoui Omg
Pausing Black Mirror to play HQ is a mood
Being sick means starting season 1 episode 1 of black mirror HERE WE GO
@Renee_Hey @billboard “Ladies, thank you but I’m fine.” Is my internal catchphrase on this application.

@itswhitneymeyer @yashar YES! Ok who writes the Céline opera? and do they need a baritone?
@yashar I think her voice would be unconventional but magnificent, it would bring a classical cast and crew on “the road” as opposed to a stint at, say, The Met, bringing it to a new audience, and critics would scoff. So....👌🏻. My counter question to you is: what opera?
Liked Rocky 3, didn’t love Rocky 3.
Rocky 3 is on and there is a lot of frustrated yelling and close ups of thighs running
@AudraEqualityMc Oh I am so ready for this!!!!!

@Eden_Eats I think the sad thing is, it was obviously put out as a “fuck you” and to highlight brilliance in the face of ignorance but also the phrase itself was so hurtful to people from those places, why repeat it? See your point.
@IamKatieMoe Haha I lapped myself. Miss you too my friend hope you’re great!

@DavidSchmid1 And although we disagree I sincerely hope this extraordinarily clever tweet gets the most favs of any you’ve had. So, like, 10 or more.
My favorite thing walking in nyc is just hearing 3 second snippets of conversations as they whisk by. Zero context. It’s hilarious. My other favorite thing is noticing (as long as they’re not driving a car) that New Yorkers are actually the most polite and generous.

Deleted that last tweet because it was stupid. Not this one though. This one’s great.
When twitter started I chose the tweets I favorited like fine china to be preserved for future generations and now I’m like LOL THAT CHEETO LOOKS LIKE A KITTY ❤️
@brianstelter Huh.

@ScottAukerman This is what makes you such a brilliant imaginative creator. https://t.co/bLWog4B5ic
Yes, 👴🏻Groban👴🏻 discovered the joys of how people have been listening to music for years tonight.
@ScottAukerman As an actor-host-model are you still able to sit back and enjoy I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter commercials?
Ok last thing after The Blind Side (the feeeeelz) I watched Score about film composers. Loved it. Always been a dream to compose for a film but terrifying because as the film demonstrates, you have to find the muse within a sea of directives and visual cues. K bye!
@keith_caulfield I will Keith thanks
NO SMALL THING https://t.co/oouoySFbAV
It’s one of the reasons streaming is so great. It’s stream of consciousness listening too. What to choose next. An old song you remembered made you a fan to begin with, instantly after a new one. Filling up the creative tank instantly. “I know Kung fu”.
Sometimes when you think about music and make music all day for a living you gotta remind yourself how to zone out, tune in, and be a fan again. Every so often. Maybe it’s the same for actors and films.
Making playlists for people is a great way to remember how much you love listening to music
I’m going to watch The Blind Side finally on this flight. My lip is gonna quiver isn’t it
@elvyyost @d_m_elms Your point being the reason! Many who need it!
@elvyyost @d_m_elms I was actually poking fun at myself because they always seat me first and I always think it’s silly and unnecessary. Y

@CharlesMcNulty Thanks Charles. These days “right” feels so maddeningly subjective. And to scroll is to self-abuse. It’s a mental health thing.
They say don’t go to bed angry. I’m tired of the news making me angry. I’m tired of twitter fueling anger back and forth. It’s toxic.
@AudraEqualityMc @60Minutes Right????
@curlygirl990 @nrsnnc Right. Me too. But the amount of guns being sold easily legally and illegally are both a problem right now.
@AriSchulman lf you genuinely think that was the thought behind this tweet then your cynicism disgusts me.
@curlygirl990 “Thank goodness for guns! They sure did stop that man after he killed 26 people including children!” yeehaw.
@brianstelter @juliettekayyem @CNN Yup.
Please tell me you are watching brilliant 12 year old Alma on @60Minutes. Chills. Hope. Art. Much needed on this sorrowful night.

@bicyclefish12 @BillEager1 😂😭
@LuciusCoverdale See we already agree. Good trained people should be able to have guns. How many owners of the 300 million guns in this country are ya think?
@BillEager1 l got nothing in response to someone questioning my intelligence who can’t spell. Correct. Take care.
@BillEager1 You’re*
And let’s cut now to our president who will console us during ah nope he opened with a joke and is now reading a paper.
@LuciusCoverdale K well you pray, and l’ll ask for better laws and between the two of us hopefully guns will disappear and we can BOTH take credit, cool?
@Mark_Price_GA l’m not a senator. But if you wanna get on the twitter-no-action argument maybe direct your annoyance at POTUS?
@AudraEqualityMc And l know how tired we both are of singing it 💔
Prayers are what the victims were doing. If you respond to these attacks with prayers but no action, you are protecting the next murderer.
Just nothing. No words. Numb. Again. May everyone affected in Texas rest in and find peace.

@tanajam Isn't "anti trump jerk" an oxymoron? Like jumbo shrimp.
@Timpanist @DJ4JG State lines are invisible. Guns cross. Unless there is a national crack down, examples like this will always be fuel for the right.
@Timpanist @falconsview My terminology was wrong. My point is 100% the same.
@torigochenouer This entire dialogue is in the spirit of keeping this from happening again. That's all. Thank you for having it with me.
@torigochenouer I understand. It is so hard.
@torigochenouer And I say all of this with all respect and gratitude in the world for what you do and what your city has been through. You asked.
@torigochenouer What I don't understand is the active protest against trying
@torigochenouer If yours and others argument is what's the point then fine! Let's SEE! Maybe you'll be right maybe you'll be surprised.
@torigochenouer Because I choose trying over cynicism. I choose proactivity over defeatism. I also see it's worked in other countries. I choose not nothing.
@MichaeIDevine I misspoke, I assumed machine gun also meant semi. We agree, still nuts.
@torigochenouer Mourning and strategizing aren't mutually exclusive. I mourn the dead. I also honor them AND future potential victims in wanting change.
In this very heated debate, thank you all for your reasoned duel sided answers to these tweets without trolling. 🤘🏻
@falconsview In other words: NRA's worst nightmare. I myself am the opposite of relieved at what happened. It should have not happened at all.
@curlyheckler You literally can't say that after a man with huge collection rains down on innocents. Again. And again.
@falconsview ...knowing that in doing so it may save others lives. That in enjoying such loose gun laws, many are actually at risk at all times.
@falconsview Every time a nutcase does this, many die. So is it worth it to the good guys to limit their own access to guns....
@falconsview I'm not saying that he wasn't a lone crazy person. Or that there aren't thousands of responsible gun owners of semis. My question is this:
@falconsview From what I have seen, he may very well have modified his semi using a legal bump-stock. He also had just so many semis. Again, why?
@DJ4JG It is something. Instead of nothing. Isn't that what making America great is all about? Trying? Not simply shrugging our shoulders?
@DJ4JG It is so easy to be defeatist I know. So many guns already. But the stats of other countries who HAVE made stricter laws don't lie.
@falconsview Then pardon my wrong terminology. I thought a semi-automatic was a machine gun. Semantics.
@TheMikeKehoe Sure! But laws are to protect the whole not the few. Some people might find beauty in collecting murder victims. Sorry pal not allowed!
@falconsview If I am I'd be delighted but it doesn't seem to be the case from all I've read
@falconsview Are semi automatic machine guns hard to get? I genuinely believe they are not hard to get in America. Gun shows. Mail. Walmart. Am I wrong?
@TheMikeKehoe I guess you could be a bomb collector. A poison collector. Just saying to collect a thing built to kill, what does that say about collector?
Anyway...I think we're all up late right now trying to reason. Figure out this division. See both sides. Find a solution. Save lives. Night!
I'm not talking hunting rifles. Pistols. General protection or sport. I'm talking machine gun collectors and the legality of that. Just why.
It is a power thing. People feel powerful with them. Owning them. Shooting them. "They want to take my power away". https://t.co/gfIzVHExxj
I'm not being glib. This is a part of the conversation that needs to be had. Culturally. There is a fear problem. A misinformation problem.
What are the chances really. Mathematically. That you will NEED your insane machine gun collection vs the chances innocents will die
Here's a stat I'm genuinely interested in: number of people wrongly murdered by guns a year vs those killed in the name of defense legally

@Valerie74669151 Did it. Now re-fucking-read.
Not equating the two. Just....what a shitty day. Going back on my walk.
What a horrid day for our country, music fans and music itself. RIP Tom Petty. His songs are always good medicine. Love to his family.
Alright I'm going for a walk. We're all full of sorrow today. I also want to give a huge thank you to the LVPD and first responders.
The sad thing is, those defending guns &amp; those pushing to limit them all WANT the same thing: Keep peace. End killing. Have this talk. Fix.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman In many cases and places that is correct yes. Not nearly as tough and complete as it should be.
@cylon8 @joshgrobanfan01 @SarahKSilverman They don't. They really don't. I'm telling you, we want the same thing. And there is a problem currently that you aren't recognizing.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Wrong. A responsible educated and restricted populous. The current laws are an absolute free for all in the name of profit. Period.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Wake up call: us liberal clowns? We want *only* responsible owners to be able to purchase them. This isn't complicated.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman So you go cling to the fears and ignorance that the NRA depend so dearly on to continue making a blood soaked profit. I'm just not engaging.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman All gun violence is bad. Against concert goers. Against children. All bad. The difference between us is you want to do nothing about it.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Must be quiet and blissful in the ignorance of Trollville. Bye.
@cylon8 @SarahKSilverman Ok. Keep fighting for an object invented for killing. In anyone's hands. Regardless of fitness to own such a thing. People are dying.
It's perfectly compassionate and human thing to be mad at murder and want to prevent it in the future. If you are "yeah but"ing me, pause.
@gopprincess123 The problem is the bodies shouldn't be cold to begin with because of ANOTHER SHOOTER. You all did this the last time. And the last time. And
@MegWClayton @Andreapitts48 This. Exactly.
@gopprincess123 Gun control. For civilians. Health checks. Not gun elimination. This argument's stupidity and defensiveness is why we have a problem.
I'm also filled with anger. Freedom should mean being able to go to school. Watch a concert. Gather to pray. Live in peace. #GunControlNow
I'm at a loss for words. Just pure sorrow for the victims and their families. For music fans around the country. For the city of Las Vegas.
My Las Vegas friends please stay safe, stay indoors. This is ongoing and looks already to be quite tragic.

My friend and @GreatCometBway family member @TheDanceCartel has a wonderful new project!! https://t.co/GXTLVsRqEA
@Barrel_El You. Tweeted. Me. Be gone.
@Barrel_El You have 2 followers, no tweets and your picture is a barrel. Seems legit.
@OnlineAlison Marnie is alive. Baby steps.
@cyberjacob The former
@lizscher @Nate_Churchill_ This comedy bit you guys just did is excellent
Go to the gym. It helps.

@pallisser What I'm saying is he doesn't help himself with this. At all. It's a mistake to let him do it.
When his eyes focus on script: on message, positive  When he goes off script: off message, negative   One is him one isn't.
@jessetyler Way way way less adorable and hopeful for the future
"he really came out and explained to the American people what's what at that rally. He seems great, I was wrong" -nobody ever, WH staff.
@hawtwyre @robdelaney 😏
@KathleenRivell1 No. Anyone can be lied to. And many people rich and poor believe him. I just feel worst for those who really do need the help.
@OnlineAlison Just turn it off. I have to.
The thing that makes me saddest, is that many of the blue collar workers Trump yells sweet nothings at have a right to be angry. He uses it.
@New0rleansLady I refuse to translate this from Haitian Creole
He👏🏻doesn't👏🏻care👏🏻about👏🏻you https://t.co/admp7Rc1WY
@robdelaney Typical trumpian response with typo. In all seriousness great Tuesday thanks bud have a great wed tomorrow
He's sick. This speech is insane. He's insane.
Trump rally cheerers and chanters, you are pawns for his ego. He wants your cheers more than he wants to work for you. It isn't about you.
Trump just said with a straight face that his "movement" has always been about loving everyone and inclusion.
"That's too bad" -trump's statement on the eclipse
Alright I'm done goodnight 😴
I howled at the sun! #YOLO
Coincidentally the total eclipse of my heart is also about 60% coverage and better on Facebook Live from Oregon
Hahahahahahahahahaahaha we are The Sims
"Who even IS my eye doctor" I just asked myself while eating a handful of dog food from a very cereal-like box #eclipse #magic
Well now I have tears in my eyes straining to experience something I never fully will in Los Angeles AGAIN

Congrats @RoryOMalley @joshuahenry20 @MichaelLuwoye @SoleaPfeiffer and the brilliant LA cast of Hamilton!!! Epic opening at the @Pantages!

@RobertSuelter I think you misread the tweet, rob
@Renee_Hey @bigfogiefan Ugh. RIP. She was very sweet.
@Renee_Hey Oh god how horrible. I'm so sorry. What happened?
@1967oldman Good and evil ain't politics. Maybe next time you enjoy my singing take a long look in the mirror while you do it.
The false equivalence is astounding. Lemme break it down for you, POTUS. Intolerance of tolerance= bad. Intolerance of intolerance= good.

My loves. The most special artists and friends. The most special show. Comets are rare. Honored to have been a part of the ride. https://t.co/Z6zB7jNekj
Thanks @timheidecker and @ericwareheim for a MUCH NEEDED laugh tonight at their 10th anniversary show. Tears. Mostly from laughter.
@RexLee_ Ha! I'll tell my assistant you said so
@CharlesMcNulty Thanks. A life highlight. She gave me the opportunity to join her on stage at the Met that night and sing for Sondheim for the first time.
Broadway is better with this brilliant diverse show on it. Plain as that. See and support while you can. All my ❤️ to my comet family. https://t.co/niFrUbtgKt
Or....OR!.....hear me out....we could all not have nukes and everyone can live on this planet together in peace. I dunno, spitballing here.

A friend. A mentor. A master. I will forever be grateful for the warmth she showed me on and off the stage. Rest in peace. https://t.co/mAacqH0z3U

Every time I hear the CNN decades theme song I get into the captain Morgan pose
@DanaSchwartzzz @Ashleyash27 I don't think so. Construction work hasn't been popular in music since the village people.

Turning the channel from news pundits to people freaking out on the price is right is the best decision I've made in maybe years
I mean...I guess it's all news.......like, the biggest spider I've ever seen in my life was on my wall last night. Where was Fox for that? https://t.co/AZF6zBVzuP

@doctorfollowill Lay me down a sick ass beat and I WILL
Just once I'd love for someone who doesn't share my political views to tell me to "shut up and dance".
"Just sing! The only person who has a right to yell their opinion is me, a person who follows you that you don't know!! Idiot!"
@BlueEyesLady1 Wait....but...you just reflected YOUR shit on me? How....how is that fair? Can't we reflect our shit on...each other? #merica #reflection 🤔
