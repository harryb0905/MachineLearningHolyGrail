Once again, I’d love to play poker with POTUS, he ALWAYS shows his cards
What else can POTUS talk about other than this border deal? We are finding out. Perhaps he’ll weigh in on the Bryce Harper sweepstakes
POTUS barely hiding his contempt for this event, apparently. If the president thought today was a winning move and day, he wouldn’t have led with some news about China talks.
His tweetstorm is backed up by data showing that despite employment gains of late, productivity of the employed is flat which then means innovation isn’t happening as fast which in turn keeps wages flat or worse...  https://t.co/87K6MNtTzX
Better rule to determine a proper boomer vs a proper GenXer.  If you were 18 during any active part of the Vietnam war, you’re a boomer.  Obama didn’t turn 18 until after Nam ended. He’s culturally GenX, end of story. https://t.co/DYa9KWUhuh

Most SOTUs are a bit disjointed; they usually sound like they were written by committee because they usually are. This speech seemed to truly lack a coherent theme... series of ideas and complaints with only immigration as a centerpiece
During the touching tribute to the Pittsburgh SWAT officer, POTUS has left out the shooter’s other motive for the shooting besides anti-semitism... the shooter was angry with the Tree of Life’s support for refugees
Interesting to hear POTUS go out of his way to be vague about who the U.S. is negotiating with in Afghanistan... trying to downplay the fact that essentially the U.S. is negotiating with the Taliban.  “The other side” etc... he went with that phrase twice.
This is a speech being dominated by immigration and the wall now... everything else will look like window dressing post-SOTU compared to his focus and fury over immigration.  This feels like he’s decided he wants the issue for 2020 more than getting this issue behind him in 2019.

Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC tells me on @MeetThePress he has "nothing against" acting Attorney General Whitaker, but adds "I don’t know if he’s the best choice… there are a lot of choices out there." #MTP
“I would encourage the president to pick someone very soon,” @lindseygrahamsc on Trump picking a new Attorney General.” #MTP

@TimothyDowling yup
Sometimes I wonder if our entire political world is just a bad movie plot... Realize that our current POTUS is meeting with the ex-husband of his son's girlfriend, who, btw, used "Trump bashing" to glide to the CA GOVship.
@kasie If BWI is in your top 10 then the list should stop before BWI is listed.
I get frustrated with lazy broadbrush “the media” criticism when it comes from campaign operatives that know better who are doing it for political reasons, but it’s particularly irritating when “the media” criticism comes from media writers who are supposed to be experts.
How do constituents view investigations of Pres Trump?  @LUnderwood630: "Oversight is critically important" and notes Republicans in the last Congress failed on that front. But that investigations are "not our primary and chief priority" #MTP
Does @ElissaSlotkin believe her election is a referendum on Pres. Trump? "No, I think honestly we were able to amass support from" people of all political persuasions because "Washington is broken" --but notes "the President was part of it" #MTP
While @SenCoryGardner said he supports the Mueller investigation, he would not give direct answer on if he would vote for legislation in the Senate to protect the investigation:  "Mueller is not going to be stopped" #MTP
NRSC chair @SenCoryGardner on Florida recount: "I understand Governor Scott's frustration that there are people who are breaking the law, violating the constitution... So I think he's right to be upset."
For upcoming fights with Pres. Trump, @RepAdamSchiff will support Pelosi for Speaker because: "We need the strongest general that we have. We need the best tactician, we need the best organizer. ... No one else honestly that comes close." #MTP
Incoming House Intel Chair @RepAdamSchiff tells me Dems have to make sure POLICY priorities don't get lost amid "flurry of investigations." Noting, even though "investigations are sexy" health care is "priority number one" #MTP
.@RepAdamSchiff on acting AG Whitaker: "If he doesn't recuse himself" from Russia probe "we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe" #MTP
Should be a great conversation with today's @MeetThePress panel: @DonnaFEdwards, @continetti, @nytdavidbrooks, @elianayjohnson   #IfItsSunday #MTP

I asked @BillHaslam about the Florida Gov. race between Gillum and DeSantis: "If you lose Florida, is it on the president?"  @BillHaslam: "I don't think any race is entirely on the president, win or lose... in governors' races, it's about the quality of the candidate." #MTP

Can’t lie, haven’t been this disappointed in a Miami season since the Coker era, 2003 season comes to mind.  Just a big fat disappointment.  Talent is never the issue at a place like Miami. This vanilla offense has to change. #gocanes
Surprised I haven’t heard any Harry Truman references yet from trailing candidates... it’s that time of the campaign... Then again, did 2016 perception forever overtake “Dewey Defeats Truman” references?

And for the handful of followers who do care about my sports tweets, my son (and me) had an epic fail of a sports rooting weekend: Canes, Dodgers, Packers, Wizards.  U-g-l-y.  He’s starting to question my team choices!
If you actually believe media is the problem then the last thing one should do is respond with your own hate and anger... Try leading; try setting an example; Try living by the mantra “two wrongs don’t make a right.” But then that would mean cutting back on stoking the division.
DCCC chair @repbenraylujan: "It's not too much to expect leaders to bring us together, to unite our country, to find a way to reach out to us to our greater good and make sure that we rise above all of the accusations and the hate and the finger pointing" #MTP

Saudi denials "ring hollow," says @JohnBrennan because Khashoggi was at a Saudi diplomatic facility, not some public space in Turkey, where they could have plausible deniability"   "It would be inconceivable" that this operation would have happened without knowledge of MBS #MTP

Always appreciate Gregg’s contributions to the political discourse... he regularly helps folks look at problems through multiple lenses. This is a constructive attempt at trying to de-escalate this “cold” uncivil rhetorical war we are experiencing. https://t.co/F97vmGBr40
Let’s be blunt, our political parties are waging a “cold” civil war... And as ⁦@amyewalter⁩ argues so well, each side rationalizes their bad behavior by pointing to the bad behavior of their “opponent”.  The incentive structure punishes moderation https://t.co/1falKJY3NK

@Tiger1187 My other fear on relying so heavily on voter files (and BTW, we’ve moved to voter files ourselves at NBC/WSJ) is that I worry about missing late movements... voter file polls are usually more stable and that’s great in a neutral political environment.

@ElectProject Both can be true.    Base enthusiasm on the right can go up even as middle keeps eroding.

Speaking as a frustrated season tix holder who answered every pre payment call from the Nats for the playoffs and all star game these last few years, this week feels like a massive gut punch. Did Rizzo have more financial handcuffs both last offseason and now than we realized?
The Nats are now an afterthought and they only have themselves to blame: on the field, in the dugout, in the front office and in the owner’s box.  Only upside: Its been a team effort I guess.
This was a pr disaster for the Nats: 1) they sent the message they didn’t want Bryce (by admitting they shopped), 2) that signals they won’t bid seriously on him in the winter and 3) they don’t think the Nats can win now. Other than that, well played! https://t.co/1HY5X811My

Today’s performance will be seen by some as circumstantial evidence.
The president tries to pull a “both sides” on the Putin v US intel and ends up essentially confessing to the world that he believes Putin more the the United States of America and its agencies.
Putin has so out maneuvered the US side, the “ball” being the cherry
Seriously, the morale hit to America’s intelligence community will be devastating.  Don’t think Putin doesn’t know and love this. https://t.co/UmezylzxKz
Not sure if you’d call it “collision” or “cooperation”
It’s amazing, Putin and Trump are coming to each other’s defense on both questions so far.
Will serious Congressional Republicans still truly sit back and say nothing following this POTUS performance on the world stage uttering what he’s said while standing and UPLIFTING one of the great adversaries of freedom and democracy?
Wow, Trump is going out of his way to praise Russia.  I guess “wow” is now an understatement, but this is truly a remarkable moment in American history, 72 hours after the DoJ accused Russia of a criminal act against the democracy, POTUS essentially forgives Russia on world stage
Will be fascinating to see how much POTUS pushes back on Putin.  The matter of fact way the translator delivers Putin’s propaganda may lull him into agreeing to things he shouldn’t be agreeing to.

Seriously, there is something missing on this Nats team, they make a lot of mistakes, the effort looks B- at best.  Statistically, the offense isn’t anemic and yet, it is anemic when you use a consistency prism.  They never string hits together, lots of solo HRs.  #meh

On the divisions within the Democratic party over #SCOTUS strategy, @Ocasio2018 tells me, "I'm a fighter, I'm always one for a fight. Especially when we see what the GOP has done."   She goes on to say: "We need to delay until after the midterm elections." #MTP
"The idea that Russia did not meddle in our election is fake news. They did meddle in our election and they're doing in again in 2018," @LindseyGrahamSC tells me on @MeetThePress
On #SCOTUS, @LindseyGrahamSC tells me: “Roe v. Wade, in many different ways, has been affirmed over the years…but I would hope the justice that sits on the Court, all of them, would listen to the arguments on both sides”  #MTP
"We're dealing with what we're dealing with today," @SenatorCantwell tells me, in response to soundbite from McConnell in 2013 saying Democrats would "regret" rules change #MTP
"I would love President Trump to pick somebody in the mainstream of American views" who is going to hold up years of precedent, says @SenatorCantwell #MTP
Looking forward to a great chat with our @MeetThePress panel this morning: @HallieJackson, @cornellbelcher, @TheBrodyFile, &amp; @KimberlyEAtkins #MTP
Make sure you tune into @MeetThePress this morning: I'll talk SCOTUS and more with @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; @SenatorCantwell.   Plus I'll sit down with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) to talk about her upset primary victory over Rep. Joe Crowley.   #IfItsSunday
He made it look so routine too, almost too routine. Hope folks appreciate what he did.  Try it yourself.  Switch hands instantly and see if you can throw out a piece of paper from 5 feet accurately and no hesitating either.  He did from about 70 feet
What Phillies pitcher Velasquez just did was amazing.  A RIGHT handler, he was hit in the right elbow, clearly in immense pain, he dropped his glove on his LEFT hand and then threw a bullet to first to get Adam Eaton, then dropped to ground writhing in pain.
Batting practice in philly alert. #nats
Important data to digest. https://t.co/1mxIy03aLe
Glad they let him gut that inning out.
Come on Fedde, get thru this inning, and #Nats go get him his first win!
Will be fascinating to see if @realDonaldTrump can go the entire weekend without alluding to some part of this story.  #takingtheunder https://t.co/5KYvWn9dAg
So I’ve gotten so used to the Nats not scoring that when I turned on the game just now and saw 4-0 in the 1st, I thought, “is this a tape of a Phillies-Nats from last year, no way they actually had multiple hits in one inning!”
@MeetThePress So it was after the fact, but it seemed we accidentally took some inspiration for our running of the interns segment from one of the funniest ad campaigns of the last 20 years.  So here’s to you, graceful intern runner.  https://t.co/s29UZNeyG5
The social media incentives are for radicals to act out... they get rewarded and it creates an outsized perception that it’s more toxic than it should be... And while the diagnosis part is easy, curing this disease of abusing social media for political gain isn’t going to be easy https://t.co/f4lWoZqK7w
@poniewozik Are they qualified to decide what’s polarizing?
@ErikWemple Not sure this is an org that is qualified to decide what “bent” a need org is or isn’t.
@ErikWemple What is that supposed to mean?
By 2020, we’ll wonder if there a single Republican had ever won before Trump https://t.co/FRsvNoK9eO
To my legal beagle types, it looks like the Chief Justice will also be the swing vote now that the court’s center shifts to the right.  When was the last time a Chief was also the swing vote?
It’s also possible he just wanted off the roller coaster.  Let’s be honest right now, this stinks for most public servants. https://t.co/wDWT8BI705
McConnell’s decision to prevent a hearing in 2016 is what will be harder to defend than simply blocking a nominee.  Had Senate GOP held a hearing and then blocked the appointment, they might be in a different place.  But Senate GOP decide to go for broke.
Matthews is right. Senate Dems (especially those who want to be POTUS) have to get caught trying to block at every turn.  This will be a Dem WH primary litmus test https://t.co/4xNe3kA1RC
I get the technical difference but it truly is an insult to voters, their opinion only matters in Prez election years, not midterms.  Got it. https://t.co/6XCo0Z3jN1
This will be a tough tweet and idea for McConnell to defend.  He has to make the case that midterms matter less than presidentials for this tweet to be taken seriously. https://t.co/6O0A48FJx8
Man, summer is going to suck... it will be ugly; normally nice people will act like idiots... we have a full fledged political circus on our hands... up to the voters to decide what they want...
So consider this: John Roberts will be the new swing justice on the court...
While Manchin, Donnelly and Heitkamp are in the electoral spotlight, so are Collins, Heller and Flake...
Odd rationale and one that history will treat so unkindly... so essentially he’s arguing that his principles aren’t that important because perception trumps all... I cover the situation we have honestly, and I get grief from the left for normalizing and from the right for bias... https://t.co/7o2kOQcq02
This would have been laughable in another era, picking an actual exec from a network regularly accused of being a bit too propagandist.  And yet it will be treated as normal by too many. https://t.co/gqHiLX6yCT
Will be interesting to see how some GOP senators rationalize the idea that it’s suddenly now ok to debate an open SCOTUS seat in an election year.  They may fully pull that hypocrisy muscle.
About the last thing our politics can handle is an open SCOTUS vacancy and Kennedy’s seat no less.  Let’s hope I’m wrong.

“The reason I'm so outspoken on this now is there is no seeming consequence to the president and lies. And if we accept that as a society, it is going to have incredibly harmful consequences in the way that we operate going forward" @MarkSanford tells me on @meetthepress #MTP

Sad to see so many intellectually dishonest folks who think pointing out incorrect facts and blatant misconceptions is evidence of bias.  Amazing the disease that has stricken so many
Today’s POTUS performance was breathtaking in the sheer number of provable falsehoods, intentional mischaracterizations and outright lies uttered.  Clearly someone feels emboldened. Will GOP leaders continue to shrug this off? Bury their head in the sand?

The cherry picking of this report is likely to only compound the credibility damage for the FBI and DOJ, even as the report itself, taken in full, is a good faith attempt to restore credibility.  But political agendas are going to prevent some from providing FULL context. #sad

Who is Michael Cohen? Only Trump may have more unique connections with “unique” individuals than Cohen. We will unpack them on #MTPDaily in 30 seconds.
So sad when folks think bullying is the best way to cover up their own problems.  A good lesson for our kids, lashing out at others doesn’t solve your own problems.
Fox answered the question of what message they planned to send to their working journalists on the Hannity situation.  We will discuss on #MTPDaily
An understatement to claim a “busy day” here in #MTPDaily land, but we’ve got a whole slew of new developments to catch you up on.  From the Bonfire of the Hannity situation to Cohen and Trump and the midterms.  We didn’t start the fire, but... see you on #MSNBC in 90secs

On the court filings showing Michael Cohen has been under surveillance, @JohnBrennan tells me: "The fact that he was going to be targeted by the FBI as far as surveillance was concerned, they would have had to meet a very high threshold for that." #MTP
Asked if she'll commit to supporting bipartisan legislation to protect special counsel Mueller, @SenJoniErnst says she wants to wait to see the final text, but “I do not believe that the president will fire Mueller. We’ll see.” #MTP

Tony Bennett handled that as well as can be expected. I like how he framed it for his team. He did his best to do what great coaches do, turned it into a teaching moment.
In 20 years, this upset by a 16 seed of the No 1 overall seed will be as memorable if not more so than whoever wins the eventual title, unless it’s UMBC to win it all.  This sporting event NEVER fails to deliver when it gets under way.

@GarrettHaake This casual comfort that fellow human beings, acting in a mob mentality, have for treating the media as if they aren’t fellow human beings or America s is truly one of the saddest developments of the last decade.  This dehumanizing of the media is disgusting and shameful.

If you work in American politics or in the Gov’t on any level and your first reaction to today’s Mueller indictment is NOT ”how are we going to prevent this from happening again and how are we going to punish Russia,” then you need to rethink your priorities as a citizen.
Feels like a day when this overly used and paraphrases quote deserves some attention:  “the gentleman doth protest too much, METHINKS!”  I added the CAPS LOCK since apparently saying something in ALL CAPS makes it more true.

If Lebron to the Lakers is still an open secret in the NBA then explain this Cavs trade via that prism?  One thing about the NBA is that it’s never boring.
This new system of recruiting in college football is great for the major programs (im a happy Miami fan) but I’m guessing this double signing day will reward programs w/money to have sophisticated recruiting depts.  will prob increase distance between haves and CFB have nots.

Not a good look by the House GOP to release cherry picked excerpts through friendly media outlets in order to build a narrative.  Only reinforces the partisan look to all this.  A truly nonpartisan act would have been a complete release without cherry picks

How many times do folks have to see that staging live remote audience for a SOTU response just doesn’t work.  I remember Christie Whitman trying that in the 90s.  Better off doing something 21st century like FaceTiming the response? Short and pointed more effective these days?
Not sure it’s a good look to be giving a standing O for keeping GITMO open.  Is that something to celebrate? No matter your position, not sure it’s something to cheer.  Perhaps refer to it as a “necessary evil”?  But clapping and cheering?
Interesting choice by WH to lead with the issue of immigrant crime before talking about a dreamer compromise.  This may be about him trying to reassure the base that he still cares about security even as he proposed Dreamer amnesty.
Both Pence and Ryan didn’t look too enthusiastic about clapping for “paid family leave”.   It isn’t a small Gov’t program which may explain why they seem to hesitate on that one.
@jtuckermartin And if she had been potus, he would have tried to make news minutes before her sotu too.    This election will never end!
WH would be better off letting him ad lib this SOTU.  When he speaks off of a prompter, he doesn’t come across as himself.
The message tonight would be better received if he practiced what he’s preaching tonight about setting “aside our differences.”   He won’t get the bipartisan response he’s looking for without some gesture beyond a few prepared words.
@KatyTurNBC There are some very small time “news” sites that too many of us accidentally read who rely on getting clicks so much that they do this regularly.  The headline then gets used by partisan trolls to reinforce false narratives either about he subject of the piece or reporter/anchor

@stephenfhayes Only NFL team to have owners in all 50 States.
Jags had to play a near perfect game, but a small mistake at end of first half, clock management with punt combined with prevent defense call might have been the difference. Brady’s gonna Brady.  You have to knock the champs totally out to beat them.
Changing the definition of “To Bortle” on the fly, @ThisShowStinks
Horrendous clock management just now by Jags... why punt before the 2min warning

This shutdown could last longer than many folks think if it happens.  Mindset becomes: Once you’ve jumped off the cliff (to mix my cliches), you simply dig in to your position.  And immigration won’t get hashed out quickly.   This may be why sen leaders are trying 11th hour deal?
Donnelly and McCaskill are probably the two red state Dem sens up in 18 that Schumer worries about the most.  It makes Donnelly’s announcement more significant than a Manchin for instance.
Just a remarkable lack of urgency here in DC with hours to go before shutdown.  Where’s bipartisan WH meeting? Where’s POTUS leadership? Where is the bipartisan Hill shuttle diplomacy-like leadership  talks. Where’s plan b or c?  Both parties prefer to spin than talk?

Another excellent night for @JoeLenski and his team... Kudos
One thing shouldn't get lost here for GOPers, don't dismiss AL as just a "Roy Moore" issue. The fact of the matter is, Jones would have gotten 45% against anyone in THIS national climate.  THAT should be a warning sign enough for the GOP re: Trump impact.
@StuPolitics And they can even afford to lose on red state incumbent and still have a tough but plausible path if you believe TN is competitive with Bredesen which is a ? to some but after tonight, why should that be a ? now?
And the answer to the question of whether a party can ask too much of a voter even in these tribal times is a resounding yes.  Alleged child molesting is indeed a bridge too far even when the opponent is a Dem in the Deep South
It’s not easy to go 0-2 in the same race with two different candidates but @realDonaldTrump just pulled that off.  He has Bannon to thank for that 2nd loss
@SethDavisHoops Go get your sharpie
Jones now ahead in raw vote.  Uncounted areas are in Jones turf.   Unless there is some hidden Moore vote that hasn’t been counted...
Bottom line: AL turnout pattern is similar to VAGOV just slightly less pronounced.
This is all about the raw turnout now. Jones is benefitting from seeing higher turnout in their strongholds while Moore’s strongholds are seeing below average turnout.  This doesn’t mean Jones is going to win but it’s the recipe he needs to win
@HotlineJosh Crazier still will be all the GOP lawyers who help Jones under that scenario.
Seeing some evidence of a turnout differential, where the blue areas are avg to high while the red areas are avg. to low... Not HUGE differentials, but the type that's making this race get tighter.
@aedwardslevy @petersuderman Exit polls aren’t conducted to tell you who won but to answer why and who voted and it’s meant to be best used after weighted to results
Did I miss @potus giving a shout out to an ailing @SenJohnMcCain who fought for this bill harder than just about any senator in office these days?
@SteveKornacki Also, Edwards is pro life.
@ScottTKennedy +130, right?
If Vegas were setting a line in ALSEN, it would likely be Moore as a -3 point favorite, simply for “home field advantage.” It would make betting Jones +3 points a very popular wager because he’s run the better race.  Good enough to beat the spread and maybe good enough to win.
@gdebenedetti @maggieNYT Like the final night in Iowa or NH, where every Des Moines or Manchester rally has more reporters and staffers than actual voters

His challenge will be the nominating process which in MN really punishes any even veiled moderate GOPer and while I’m old enough to remember Pawlenty as the “conservative alternative” in the state, the definition of “conservative” has changed https://t.co/7NibiaAtJQ
@sidrosenberg You will never convince me of this for one reason.  Huizenga screwed it up from the start.  A better owner who cared about Miami with a stadium in the city from the get go could have changed this.  It was half assed from the start
Appreciate the @AmericanAir pilot on my BWI flight referring to landing in “Baltimore” and not buying into the fiction that this airport is somehow a “Washington area” airport... #droptheW

@cbfowler If they had stayed home in the South today, they would have seen their share of snow as well! Flakes in Mobile and Pensacola today and last night!
@KeithOlbermann Miami didn’t even actually get a team until about five years ago.  Again, Huizenga refused to develop a Miami fan base.  But the garbage was always picked up on time
Ok, venting over about the continued mishandling of baseball in Miami.  Glad to see they made such an effort to work with Stanton on a contract restructuring.
@GhostofMarino Beg @RobManfred to step in the way they (MLB) stepped in to rid the Dodgers of the McCourts.  I’m sorry a true local Miami group didn’t end up with the team. I’d like to think @JebBush would have been the type of owner who would have factored the fans in.
@flasportsbuzz Apparently once a Yankee, always a Yankee
You can’t judge baseball in Miami fairly because the very first owner was a city of Miami antagonist... His initial decision to call them the Florida Marlins was among the first of many terrible mistakes. It should be Latin America’s favorite team, and yet... https://t.co/SotW2VvOcf
Fair point... that stadium deal was a BOON for the Marlins and they rewarded the city with... this https://t.co/MSPmHiaoOJ
The most unsuccessful franchise over a 25 year period that somehow has two championships... It’s what the owners did to those teams that only reinforces the point that Miami has been cursed with bad owners https://t.co/08IXMJmpu9
@JohnRestaino13 And now this disaster with the latest ownership group...
@JohnRestaino13 Selfish and short sighted owners... and MLB has awarded the wrong owner EVERY time. Owner 1 (Huizenga) had the BRIGHT idea of NOT naming the Marlins after Miami. Then, to the relief of DC, MLB refused to let failed Expos owner Loria have the Nationals but gave him the Marlins
...every single Marlins owner has acted like some hedge fund manager who buys the team, strips it of its assets in the name of “rebuilding,” only to once again drive away another generation of potential Miami Baseball fanatics. Stanton is a once in a generation player... dreadful
As a Miami native and Baseball fanatic, I always dreamed of living in a city with a MLB franchise. I somehow moved to one of the OTHER few cities (DC) that didn’t have one either... Miami got its team AFTER I left. But I was excited... and yet [1/2]
It’s been surprising how the sports world (at least lately) appeared to have escaped this cultural moment... until now.  https://t.co/Pb1ykyUXn3

@TheStateOfTheU And more importantly, Miami hasn’t earned the benefit of the doubt yet.  Until Miami wins the ACC once, they’ll continue to be seen this way
Totally agree. Miami isn’t getting the benefit of the doubt yet. That’s ok with me, should be good motivating tool for the team. https://t.co/chIv9LtpAL
And if not Dusty, who? Setting quite the high bar for next manager.  So World Series or fired? Is that the bar? Good luck with that
Just gonna say it: sorry to see Dusty go.  I think he was judged based on his track record with other teams, not this one. Deserves better
So great to see an all time franchise finally get back to the World Series.  Back where blue belongs. #Dodgers

Does a person who believes in democracy and the rule of law utter this? https://t.co/x9duCfEQWU
@ajjaffe I hope you got that quote on camera.
Btw, the Expos were just as cursed.  See 94 and the cancelled season when they had the best team in baseball and the 81 loss to the Dodgers
Say folks trying to rationalize losing.  How much more character do the Nats need? https://t.co/R887PbzGJI
13 men LOB.  Let that sink in.   #Nats
@JohnFeehery @benpershing Or throw
Just tried to tell my 10yo that losing like this will only make an eventual playoff run feel that much better.  Welcome to fandom son
And so the DC sports curse continues.    I know the country hates Washington but let’s have sports sympathy. What 4-sport town has it worse?
This Game 5 could not have gone better for the Dodgers, both Cubs and Nats have spent pitching staffs
MLB owes the Nats an apology for the horrendous review decisions.  Two highly questionable reviews potentially alter outcome of Game 5.
That was a horrendous no call.  What’s the point of having the interference rule for 2nd if you don’t make that call?
Huge call here now.  Will mlb get this right or will the Nats get you know what-ed
The boy went rally cap at the start of this inning.  He promises to not take it off now.  Keep it up Nats.  Needed that 2! https://t.co/Zv9YEB54sU
That felt like a dagger
That was a new and unique way even for DC to melt down. Let’s make it something to laugh about later, time to get some runs. Let’s go Nats
@JakeSherman I’m sorry, I don’t get the dump on Werth stuff vs the rest of this lineup.  At least Werth is seeing a lot of pitches and getting on a bit
@jbarro Could it be the folks writing the tax plan don’t make a middle class income and don’t easily understand and feel the impact?
So why the period after “Gee”? Btw, wish I could add a better song title pun but can’t top “stayin alive” on this one. https://t.co/lHFO1qrad7
Most of us who have learned via experience to discount SOME of the things POTUS says.  Problem is figuring out which to discount.

Great job by @MarkRicht and co at halftime.  This was an entirely different team in the 2nd half.  #itsgreat2B...
The Malik Rosier coming out party.  He has made a huge leap this half.  #GoCanes
Miami has dodged a bullet, they should be down 2 or 3 scores minimum. Let's see if conditioning and depth take over in 2nd half
Scary how poorly Miami's secondary is playing.  They look lost
Miami playing like a team that hasn't played in a month.  Lots of "first game" like mistakes.  Hoping it's cleaned up in 2nd half
So odd to watch a Miami game and NOT have Miami be the most penalized team.
