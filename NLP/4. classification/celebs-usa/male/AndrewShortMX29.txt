@FuzzyHall Rocking for sure! Getting better everyday doing P/T w @coachseiji. Thx for checking.
@coachseiji unbelievable to see the fire zone and what it destroyed.
@mxmasta Kenny reminds me of it almost daily when I'm around him! Still best day ever on a dirt bike though.
@swhitmore89 now you better deliver some smiles in your tweets!
I love #Huntsman he said during the debate if elected to the White house he brings his dirt bike!

@coachseiji Crazy
Thank you for the prayers! It's crazy around here fire within 7 miles of the Short Family Farm. My hometown is devastated.
@CodyWhitfill So sorry. Praying for you and your family.
Thx to everyone for all the prayers and help. Crazy couple days. Makes you appreciate the good ones.
They say 85% of the county burned. 40,000 acres almost 600 houses gone. State park by our house is gone. Fire seems to be moving away now
Wind is blowing in a good direction for us right now. Changes all the time so quick.
Down the road from us. http://t.co/vcIkYcS
Winds helping us out. 7 miles away right now. They just said 25,000 acres and 470+ houses by us in our town gone. Sad
I trust in God. Feel helpless being broken up right now. Can't pack tools or any moto stuff. Bummed
All cell towers down in Smithville. Fire is close again to our place everybody is here is shifting gears. Scared again. Faith being tested!
@BmxDad4 I don't ride horses here at the farm... No kill switch and race gas is cheaper than hay! Plus I don't scoop poop.
@jacobedens Nice! The new @FlyRacingUSA  replica helmets are sweet.
4 dogs 2 cats. We have 10 horses here 8 dogs and 7 cats plus our chickens. Feels like a mini zoo for this city boy. So sad what happened
Fire destroyed up to 400 homes 14,000 acres last night. Came close to us but now is past us. Gained 1 family and friends last night 6horses
25ph winds, driest it's been in 50 years. 14000 acres and counting and over 300 homes burned since 4pm today within miles of r house. Scared
@KenRoczen94 so proud of you. You deserve it! Enjoy
@JCJillCox Congrats! Amazing job
@DavidVuillemin wow, never seen that before

@MarvinMusquin25 Happy for you and the team.

@AlexahPearson Good job at Southwick. Glad u didn't let dirty 30 beat you in her first race back! J/k!
@BeckyBeckKyle Happy for you guys with Briggs! Really cool.
Texas road kill...
@pulpmx . To try and regain sight on the bad eye they patch the good one.... He is going to pulling chicks in no time! #pirate
@swizcore everything initially was super rare for a baby but now dealing with the eye lens,retina is common. We hope he can regain vision
@pookiematthes Duh! Don't know how I could forget that.
Thankful for all the prayers and support. The short family is very happy today!
Next step is to try and get a contact developed to see if he can get some vision in the eye going. His pupil is really big and always will B
Our son Hudson just had his big check up and things went great. Retina still attached. Just waiting for the air bubble to go away now.
@AdamCianciarulo I'm leading the pack of people on Summer Vacation!
@pookiematthes Is it @CLMoser  B-day? Oh boy!!!
Funny how quick life can change... The highlight for today was going to Wal-mart just to get out of the house.
@tomdanielson I love it! Good job today and kill it on your home turf tomorrow.
@racerxonline Gothic J gets a win!
@DavidVuillemin started there last year both motos... Not fun and not a good race to get last pick.
@KenRoczen94 you deserve it! So it's ok.    :)
Weird waking up in bed looking at tweets from the race...
@frankielatham I love it! Going crazy here at home!
@Racerxvt because they are made in Colorado they have to be Good!
@Racerxvt
@hannah_morais I second that.
Pumped for @tomdanielson  at the us pro challenge in Co killing it today. Awesome race. Love it. Can't wait for tomorrow.
And since it's only rained once since February when I got back from the start of Sx I'm pretty excited to be looking at rain clouds tonight!
70th day over 100* today and broke the record! Ugly. It was "cool" to train in but now that I'm on "vacation" I would like it to cool down.
@Mrs_Moser thx again
Thx @CLMoser  #1fan http://t.co/6eXFs1L

Thoughts and prayers for the whole Johnson family in New Mexico. Sad to hear about Vern this morning.
@DavidVuillemin Goes both ways though bc last year at Southwick I got messed up both motos... Either way not good.
Chain derailed 1st Moto at the bottom of screw U for a DNF. Second moto horrible pick = horrible start to finish 8th. Unadilla Rocks...

Chillaxing w/ @rendawgfmx  in MN airport on the way home from the @KTMUSA  dealer meeting. #funnyguy

Some local kid here on a Kawi was throwing Stewart size whips... Impressed. Colorado=Heaven.... Love it here
Did the early morning session with the team here in Colorado for the local news. Track is rad, similar to MXdN.
Happy Bday @Lars22Wrench  the Swedish miracle!
Just landed in Denver with Emma. Flight out of Austin got delayed 5 hours! For a 3 year old she held her own! I love Co!
Just read on cycling news that @tomdanielson is confirmed for the tour. Congrats you deserved it! Nice TT in Suisse.
@Jacki_Short -&gt; classic, so much fun.... Right after this picture I'm pretty sure you t-boned me and smashed my pc pipe!
Driving home today our lil girl Emma said that the cow over there was "Horny"! Caught Jacki and I off guard until we realized it had horns!
7:00 and Jacki's car still says 101*. Can't wait to go to Colorado on Wednesday with my lil Emma.
Going to get ugly hot today at home... Still two more hours til it peaks. http://lockerz.com/s/112288922
Budds was better for me than last week but still way off.... Can't wait to get to the best place on Earth next week. Colorado!

@CLMoser -&gt; she told me she likes your profile pic!
@stikmanglaspell -&gt; I wanted to say the same thing but didn't want to call Beeks out. In six months the dog will be sleeping outside!
@bmahon56 -&gt; and eating grilled cheese with @kdub_14 not many people get to do that!
@bmahon56 -&gt; church camp and mx combined is the best! Fcamx.com has camps across the country... After Red Bud I'm going 2 the Illinois camp.
@Jacki_Short -&gt; no actually she said "why are your eyebrows white?". That should make @TreyCanard happy. #clearbrow4life
@CLMoser -&gt; love the profile pic....
@coachseiji --&gt; feel awesome except for my hammies... Going to be sore tomorrow fo'sure!
@lancearmstrong -&gt; more MX and LA... Pretty cool.
@Jacki_Short -&gt; we appreciate it so much! Thx everyone.
@OrangeBrigade-&gt; Kenny should have pulled an elevator instead of scrubbing that thing!
Hudson's eye keeps getting more rare and complicated each visit. Two more surgeries... Thx again for the support for H.

@CodyWhitfill -&gt; likewise! Thx for the prayers. Hope you and your family are great.
@Antoniocairoli-&gt; Good job today! The points look better every weekend for you.
@KTM_Racing--&gt; Kini was one of the coolest moto guys I have ever met. Besides being a bad dude on the track!
Worked on my speed today and found the limit once going down a hill. Made Frankie happy at least to see me suffer and crash...
@fkwrench --&gt; I second that! Good job in the quali race.
@efonseca10 -&gt; Ha Gothic is awesome...
@hannah_morais --&gt; Congrats @BeckybeckKyle so happy for you guys.
