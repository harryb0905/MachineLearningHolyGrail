@phrank_blank_o Watch episode 2 with her.
@RyanPyle @mcfnyc @netflix @andrewrowat And we got to eat dinner there after shoot. It was a great day.
@RyanPyle @mcfnyc @netflix @andrewrowat Yes!! And we even played "Twin Peaks" theme in the bathroom hallway too.
@jratliff3456 @MasterofNone I LOVE THAT SONG. @turquoisewisdom's idea. Same with Townes song at end, so good.
@Video_Game_King Aniz is my brother, read below!
AND our cast: Noel Wells, Eric Wareheim, Kelvin Yu, Lena Waithe, my parents - rehearsed a lot with me and helped refine our dialogue.
Also, Sarah Schneider and Jason Woliner worked on a few episodes too. And our godfather EP, Mike Schur, helped with some writing too.
Harris Wittels (@twittels) wrote many beautiful, hilarious things on the show before he passed and the series is dedicated to him.
Writing staff includes: me, Alan Yang, Aniz Ansari, Sarah Peters, Zoe Jarman, Joe Mande, Andrew Weinberg, Andrew Blitz.
Another note about the show - though most episodes say "written by Aziz and Alan," the whole staff contributes to all the episodes.
Not a mistake, my brother Aniz wrote on the show and came up with many of my favorite jokes. https://t.co/Vz1AS8knPy
@theilluminashi PRASHANT!
@KellyPboom Oh no, I'm so sorry, did mean to get you trolled, I was just making a joke. Apologies!
@jaseinfeld Check my timeline, tweeted it a few tweets ago
Yes! Reading Sherry's book Alone Together is where I first learned about Paro.  https://t.co/NU06nKZfMj
@MadangzzKay There was a thing where he said "Yemadeeeeeee!" in the dinner but we had to lose it. Tamil is a hilarious language.
@craigkoenewho @jamesponsoldt We told James we wanted it to feel like those iconic 70s comedy films and he liked that idea and got it done!
@inmybunk Haha, that's Aziz's notification noise. CLOWN HORN FTW
@ronpooboy69 We worked together with the music supervisor Zach Cowie, I love all the music in the show.

If you preorder the book right now at http://t.co/kztneKCBsB, we'll give you a link to DL the intro chapter and one of the audio chapters.
So that's my book, and I'm really excited for everyone to read it.
@azizansari After all that, I learned a shit ton and put it all down to make a book that is interesting, thoughtful, and hilarious.
We also enlisted some of the best social scientists to help us understand and study all the facets of modern love and romance.
@azizansari We talked to old people, married people, young people, single people, everybody.
@azizansari  The whole thing was more than a year and a half of research, hundreds of interviews all over the world, from Wichita to Tokyo.
To learn about all of this, I teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and we designed a massive research project.
@azizansari Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soulmate.
@azizansari ..and in about 6 months, the new couple would get married and have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four.
A few decades ago, ppl would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet...
Through online dating and beyond, single people now have an infinite number of ‚Äì but how do you sort through infinite options?
Online dating is the biggest way people meet their spouses now, more than work, school, and friends COMBINED.
If you are single, you have problems like, "Why did this dude just text me ‚ÄòHey‚Äô and an emoji of a top hat?
@azizansari If your partner leaves their FB open &amp; you see msgs from someone named Alexia, is it cool to read em? Who the fuck is Alexia?!
If you are in a relationship, do you share your email or phone passwords with your partner? Or keep that shit locked?
@azizansari Love in the modern era is totally unique, strange, and fascinating.
A lot of ppl have been asking what my new book Modern Romance is about, so I thought I could explain it with a nice huge Twitter rant‚Ä¶

Sorry everyone. #GhostPlane is on pause. I just got home and have to be up early to shoot Parks. I'll try to finish this sometime.
Anne hears a knock on a passenger window. She glances out. Two NAVY Seals (Drake &amp; Chris Pine) are outside the plane! #GhostPlane
Anne: Guys look! THE DOLL PIECES COMBINE A LA THE T-1000 TO FORM A GIANT SUPER DOLL A LA VOLTRON. #GhostPlane
Raj: Wait hold up. I did see Non-Stop. It was okay! Neeson: Okay? Shitty thing to say. I just killed 32 haunted dolls -- #GhostPlane
Raj: Non-Stop? Neeson: Exactly. You saw it? Raj: Just remember the trailer. #GhostPlane
Anne: How do you have a gun? Neeson: I'm an Air Marshal. Became one for my film, one where I was on a plane, forget the name. #GhostPlane
Raj: NEESON? How will you stop the doll? Neeson: Like this. NEESON PULLS OUT A GUN AND STARTS TAKING OUT THE DOLLS ONE BY ONE. #GhostPlane
A mysterious man in a hoodie: "If you want to stop the dolls. You need my help." He lifts the hood: ITS LIAM NEESON AS HIMSELF! #GhostPlane
Oh my god. #GhostPlane is trending? I just landed! Alright I gotta keep going til I get home.
Raj takes his seat. He shares a smile with Anne. A suitcase falls. It opens. ITS FILLED WITH CREEPY DOLLS THAT COME TO LIFE. #GhostPlane
The Capt: Hey kids, guess what? We're flying to Disneyland. Anne: It's working! The kids aren't possessed anymore! Raj: Whew. #GhostPlane
Capt and Raj: "You know ghosts, what do we do? What do these kids want?" "Fly the plane to Disneyland." "Huh?" "Now damnit now!" #GhostPlane
Anne tries to seat the kids. One of them screams with a demon voice "PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF!!" Anne is launched to the back by the #GhostPlane.
YG: "Maaaaan, this some bullshit. First peanuts hit my face, now kids is fucking levitating. I can't even watch the movie!" #GhostPlane
The lights in the cabin go off. A Frank Sinatra song starts playing on the PA. ALL THE KIDS ONBOARD START LEVITATING. #GhostPlane
Raj: You need to land this plane. The Captain (Tom Hanks): I can't. The ghost... he's piloting the plane... #GhostPlane
Raj: "Folks, I'm a paranormal investigator. I can handle this." YG: "Handle these nuts! Fuck you AND these ghosts!" #GhostPlane
A passenger played by rapper YG exclaims, "MAN THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT! FIRST WE DELAYED, NO WE GOT MOTHERFUCKING GHOSTS!?" #GhostPlane
The Captain (Academy Award Winner Tom Hanks) announces, "Ladies and gentleman. There is a ghost on board. Please stay calm." #GhostPlane
The box falls down again. Peanut bags start flying right at passengers faces. Raj: OH FUCK! Anne: What!!!? Raj: This is a #GhostPlane.
Flight attendant ANNE (Academy Award Winner Jennfer Lawrence) puts it back. Falls again. "You fucking nuts. Stay up there!" #GhostPlane
The plane is in the air A box full of bags of peanuts falls down. Raj looks uneasy. "Was it the ghost?" He thinks... #GhostPlane
Raj uses the plane washroom pre-take off. He sees a face in the mirror. "This might be a ghost" he thinks.... #GhostPlane
Open on Indian guy RAJ (Aziz Ansari) saying bye to his parents. He gets on the plane. But this plane is actually a GHOST PLANE. #GhostPlane
Ok, I'm going to tweet out my haunted plane movie GHOST PLANE while I wait for my plane to land. #GhostPlane
Ok I guess there has been some movies about that. Nevermind. Bye Twitter.
@kyeo138 So good!!!!!
Dude. For real. Is any studios into GHOST PLANE? I can make it cheap. It's all one location. Just the plane.

Also I'd like to believe that Tom Haverford and Harrison were college roommates. Hence their similar sense of style. (cc @ShondaRhimes)
Want to enthusiastically recommend everyone marathon the fuck out of ABC's Scandal. @shondarhimes and co made an AMAZING show. Loved it.
.@S_C_ Was it true the original title of Tom Ford was Izod?
.@S_C_ Are we really pushing our Illuminati lunch meeting for you to do this Twitter Q and A?
.@S_C_ For real, what's your favorite pasta you've had in 2013?
@S_C_ Can I do Swizz-esque adlibs on the next album? "Let's get to it!" "Woo!" "Watch out for bees!"
I also think Harrison and Tom go to the same shop for their suits. They have very similar style.
Since Parks and Scandal exist in the same universe (see previous tweets), I now want to believe Olivia's mentor was Donna Meagle.
I feel like Tommy and Harrison would be buds.
Perd Hapley is in Season 2 of Scandal. Meaning Olivia Pope exists in the Parks universe!!

I'M THINKING ABOUT A TOWN MADE OF ICE CREAM, DIFFERENT BUILDINGS ARE DIFFERENT FLAVORS! WOW THIS IS AWESOME.
Other things cities could be made of: mac and cheese, parpadelle pasta, pizza, ice cream!!!!
Thought that went through my head "What other foods would it cool for a town to be made of?" God damn it. I have a problem.
I'm going to be so fat one day :/
Quickly deduced if a town were made of brisket, I would carry a squeeze bottle of my favorite BBQ sauce, slaw, &amp; white bread at all times
Ever since that Briskettown tweet ,I've been thinking about a town made of brisket for way longer than I should be.
Very sad to discover Briskettown is a restaurant and not a secret Brooklyn neighborhood made of brisket that I didn't know about

If I got approached to a direct to DVD Hitch sequel, let's just say... I would definitely do it no questions asked.
