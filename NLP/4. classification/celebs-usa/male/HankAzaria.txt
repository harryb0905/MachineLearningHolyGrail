The more stupid jokes me and #AmandaPeet made, the straighter the doctor played the scene
She's the face of our movement https://t.co/JeAw2lRC8b
Ironically placed KY jelly ad #Brockmire
That was not a sound effect. That baby was actually screaming like that. Give it up for those pipes. #Brockmire
That @Paul_Rae and @MollyEphraim exchange is one of my favorite moments in this episode
.@MollyEphraim is fantastic
Learn from him kids https://t.co/avEf3OdTTm
Love that #Brockmire was thinking that a 16 year old kid would get a "dr Joyce brothers" reference
https://t.co/GNHl1y7hz6
One of the great joys of my life was watching @Tyreljwill try to throw a baseball #Brockmire

@Tyreljwill You made me proud tonight
And the @Tyreljwill head shake and Amanda's look of terror when they reacted still kills me every time #FuckStump #brockmire
Not "bleep stump." "FUCK STUMP" ladies and gentleman
Annnnnd completing the triple play of ad libs @Tyreljwill with "these are their stories"
Neither is my son, who calls him "baseball guy" https://t.co/PEHmbs3hwN

One of my favorite subtle @Tyreljwill ad libs: "albums y'all"

@shadymapes @RichEisenShow @JimBrockmire @BrockmireIFC I can confidently agree
What do you think we bleeped there? Hint: it's not dick #Brockmire
Don't miss the first pitch. #Brockmire starts now on @IFC. Here we go...

@jerkyboykamal r u the real Kamal? The actual jerky boy??
Small consolation watching DeAndre Hopkins torch Darrelle Revis- Hopkins is on my fantasy team. Still- let's go #Jets !
@ItsBlackmayne  Welcome! Thanks for watching!
@Gluonsrule He actually said "tsurris"?? That's hilarious. Did u go the Sammy Davis Jr. route and convert?
@garethcoats Tell her hello and we will both try to help with your self expression. :)

@Glenny927 @warriors I meant smoking and inhaling.

... 17 of the last 20 teams that won game 1 of the world series (like KC did) won that world series...
... 7 of 7 teams that lost the world series and returned the following year (like KC did) won the world series...
Facts Met fans gotta hate: 6 of 7 teams that swept the CS (like the Mets did) lost the world series...
OK Met fans, enjoy... #LGM https://t.co/5lG8xPCON7

Cochran lives!!!  For now......  #RayDonovan
I think Bridgette should have talked to Uncle Terry about her love of Scarface. #RayDonovan
This all could have been avoided if Ray had just checked his ass for a poker.  #RayDonovan
I believe it was Henny Youngman who First said : "take my balls, please".  #RayDonovan
With hindsight, Cochran probably shouldn't have called #RayDonovan a name.
What if Abby also made out with Mickey? #RayDonovan
Hookers by the pool. The American Dream. #RayDonovan
You gotta hand it to Cochran, he can definitely f@#$ with people.  #RayDonovan
....And then it got weird.  #RayDonovan
Terry and Abby make the strangest nice couple ever. #RayDonovan
Jiffy pop and ruining a rug. Can Cochran party or what? #RayDonovan

@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 She won't let that sparkle thing go.
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 Ah Sean-- today u r a man. Anyone else surprised that Tierra didn't fall down on the way out?
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 And the emmy goes to... Tierra's eyebrow.
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 I'm imagining Jack Nicholson doing what Tierra is saying to Sean as a dramatic monologue from A Few Good Men
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 Well Tierra  moved off the word "like" thing. And on to the "hate" thing.
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 Let's count Tierra's "Likes" in this scene: so far there are 7...
@MUTonnage Oh I think it's over that border.
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 They redid Lesley's makeup! Mid date!
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 "they said Hank you have a sparkle"-- how I got started in show business.
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 Is it a bad sign that I refer to Linsey as "Crazy girl"?
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 do u think Des's parents also met on a TV show?
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 Remember when they asked "what's your favorite chain restaurant"? These conversations have changed...
@BachelorABC @SeanLowe09 I haven't been tweeting at u guys, I'll retweet them later!
@thebachelorabc Really, Linsey is surprised that someone else was flirting with Sean?
My friend Kevin; "Substitute teacher, that's a job??"
#thebachelor Married in 10th grade and divorced by senior year. Well, that lasted longer than my first marriage.
#thebachelor I think Lesley is my favorite
#thebachelor "I hate that bitch" lol
#thebachelor "time's ticking"-- no no, it's "the clock is ticking" or "time's a-wasting"
#thebachelor Do the producers make these guys keep the biggest drama queen?
@chatichika @SeanLowe09 thx!
#thebachelor Well Tierra's cougar song was touching.
#thebachelor Do u think those bummed reactions from the girls really happen in the moment that they read the date card?
#thebachelor I am also not friends with girls who are friends with my boyfriend.
I forgot to #thebachelor these tweets... Ok will this be the night that Sean finally stops responding to whoever is crying the hardest?
@thebachelor@seanlowe I can't control my eyebrow either. At least not 24/7
@celinedion98 sadly
It's Tierra time everyone!!
Married in 10th grade and divorced by senior year. Well, that lasted longer than my first marriage.
@SeanLowe seems like a genuinely good guy and I hope this experience turns out well for him. And please start by getting rid of Tierra.

This one of the funniest things I've seen in a while: http://t.co/eHSdWmey
@hanksbit Who started this?? Because I wonder if they realize that my zzzzzzzzzzzzz
My first tweet from a plane!!... Huh. That wasn't quite as much fun as I thought it was gonna be. Ah, life, you inscrutable minx.
What's your favorite era, people? Mine's the mesozoic.
In my hometown there was a fondue place that later became a crepe place. Then it became a french toast palace. The first 2 facts are true.
I confuse tackle with tickle a lot.
Jim Brockmire returns to the NFL network tomorrow with the @RichEisen Podcast. On a separate note, I enjoy almost all forms of syrup.
Let's all express our gratitude today by eating until we are uncomfortable with ourselves and our families.
Fennel is a vegetable that tastes like licorice. I supposed there are more disgusting things than that, I just can't thin of any right now.
@AmandaColumbus Hey! Miss u too. I've been great, u?
Well the Jets didn't look so great this weekend. But went to the Happy Feet 2 premiere and really loved it. Now I'm a Penguin fan.
There are like 6 really good NFL match ups this weekend. Go Jets!
@Mommaroze Now wait-- how r u related to Mike Senning?
@hellodexter Do you need luck on your last day of school?
I have absolutely nothing to say!
@kembarSIYEM I've always thought I kind of look like Steiner!!
More JIm Brockmire NFL ridiculousness!!: http://t.co/krTyydcG
@DaveKrumholtz Tat is F'in hilarious!
My son lit his first Jack o' lantern tonight. Anyone familiar with the origin of the Jacko? Totally horrifying and inappropriate for kids!
@KenHCampbell Hey pal! How r moo?
My son only likes to sing the "moo moo here" part of Old Mcdonald.
@CyberDiva2 It's Boris Karloff : )
@AndreasGeorge see my earlier tweet-- find a vocal coach and heve them help u put together a cd!
@TheCheeseToon It's harder than  getting into acting in many ways! Find a great voice coach and have them help u put together a cd.
@KatHigginsToGo u got it sister
Check out this wonderful article written by the cofounder of my educational non profit: http://t.co/2pjRXAk6
Hey folks, here is the link to the televised Brockmire on the @RichEisen podcast: http://t.co/B3MG6RXl
Here's the full radio version of Brockmire-- he's the last guest after Ray Loeonard: http://t.co/fvr1Vgqm
Allright no more Free Agents, but Jim Brockmire lives! http://t.co/B3MG6RXl, and get the backstory here: http://t.co/BXmOxON5
Thanks to NBC for giving us a shot, thanks to all who watched Free Agents, and thanks to all who worked on the show- we had so much fun!!
Thanks for watching everyone! I'll watch things you do, just let me know where you'll be doing them and I'll just show up.
I wasn't crazy about wearing that tan corduroy jacket, but by the time I decided I hated it, it was too late...
I really love working with this cast-- I mean I guess I wouldn't really say if I didn't, but they all kill me...
... NBc tonight at 8:30... 10 minutes!!
Ok thanks for watching East coast and central folks. Gonna tweet in real time with the West coast feed...
... Tell NBC you think the show is worth it-- 8:30 tonight after Up All Night...
Watch Free Agents tonight!! Be part of TV history by saving this funny smart show! Then if you like it call Universal PR at 818 777 3030...
Okay it's do or die time for my show Free Agents-- we need eyeballs tonight at 8:30 on NBC!! Watch tonight or we may go away...
... Well, help save the show!! It's smart and funny and on NBC wednesdays at 8:30!! Free Agents, that is...
Hey kids, please watch Free Agents this wednesday at 8:30. I fear it may be your last chance!!
@natashaleggero All vtamin enimas aside, you were hilarious on Leno last night! All
I'm everywhere, apparently: http://t.co/hllUTZnn
My son has been singing his head off in his crib since 6 am. The lyrics feature: Hey Mommy, Hey Dada, Where Oobi?(our cat) and Aaaaaaaaah...
Thanks for watching everyone!! The shows we have coming up get better and better and we all genuinely love doing it! John Enbom is awesome!
I will never leave the Simpsons but I love doing @nbcfreeagents! Just watching Kathryn Hahn do her thing close up is great fun...
I probably made up about 50 different weird sexual positions for that early scene... i.e,The penitent farmer, we fell down went boom...
I'm not actually watching right now, cuz I'm in LA, but believe me I've seen it...
@RealJMaut Much summer camp love, brother.
Ah! Sorry-- NBC!!
Ok I'm gonna try to be on twitter as my new show #Freeagents airs at 10:30-- please tune in!!
Watch Free Agents tonight on NBC at 10:30, 9:30 central!! Come on, I don't ask much (of YOU guys, anyway)...
Sage advice from The Free Agents cast: http://t.co/JWvhj91  Tune in this wednesday at 10:30!!!!!
Back in NYC-- Go Jets!!
In an almost heroic display of narcissism, here's me talking about my new show! http://t.co/Iv7gJwG
Actually have a break on the set of the new NBC show I'm shooting. Which I choose to fill by tweeting, apparently.
Very nice 2nd weekend for Smurfs! Keep bringing the kiddies... again and again and again...
This is for the Gargamel in all of us: http://t.co/LtwbjLp
Go see the Smurfs this weekend!!! Or Gargamel will get you...
I'm gonna be at FAO Schwartz @1130 to present a "smurf-alator". I'm not quite sure what one is either, and I'm Gargamel.
@SparklePirate Nice chatting with you Anya
In NYC. The temperature is the surface of the sun. There's a union protest on my block featuring airhorns all morning. So far, good trip!
@LadyCAT80 No! You didn't offend at all! I was just teasing both of us...
@lauramariemusic You are very talented I thought it was lovely. Thank you again!
@lauramariemusic Yes let me know, very curious-- thank you!
@LadyCAT80 Is it dorky for a 47 year old to make it?
@TJ800 Ha! That would have been awesome.
@dougscherer Thanks man! Spamalot was my favorite experience ever.
@lauramariemusic Wow, I'm flattered! Can I hear the song?
@DemetriPro Nose, yes. Mole, no.
@dangerous1970 I think it's a week later in the UK
Well folks, Smurfs opens on July 29th. Go see it, and bring the kids, or Gargamel will get you. How do I know? I'm Gargamel.
@thepoopchills 3,2,1... it's happening.
@bainerd Ha! Remember "the Ajax squeak"?
@Mistletoe2010 Aw, thank u very much. U have excellent taste!
@LadybugJennlee I do, my college roommate was an attorney there
@wheelsmccoy my Dad is very silly.
@LadybugJennlee tell her hello!
... allright, a slightly higher tech version of my Dad.
After what seems like 17 years, it is finally hot again in LA. That's right I just tweeted about the weather. I'm officially my Dad.
Really enjoyed Game Of Thrones. How did those Dragons get hatched, though?
You know what is not a great nickname? Lunchmeat.
Back in NYC, saw more people in one night than I do in 3 months in LA.
I'm heartbroken that Clarence Clemmons is gone. Thank you for so much great music and so many memories.
The Mets are actually hanging in there. Well, now I've just jinxed them.
Anyone old enough to remember when people said "Go fly a kite" as an insult? Doesn't seem that bad, flying a kite. Wish I could right now.
@thebigboymarky I have seen many movies more than ten times!! All Godfathers, Goodfellas, 48 Hours, The Sting, and yes, Roadhouse!!!
Ya know what sucked when we were kids? The silent treatment. Sucks now, too, but you run into it less.
@MrsDevrox remind me of this! What show??
@jennihahna @momandel thx u were a great host!
@jennihahna @momandel
@momandel I fought in the Phillipines for 2 years under the name "the Icelandic horse"
@kevinpollak Quiet ok?
I gotta admit, I was like 3% relieved when the world didn't end yesterday. Just on the off chance...
Here is a little trailer of my new show. We'll be on weds at 830 after Christina Applegate's new show-- http://www.nbc.com/free-agents/
@mxedtr Let's dance this time!!
@RobinRuzan Maybe I'll see u in NYC!!
... Correction, Free Agents was not BBC but Channel 4 in England. Not up on my British TV channels...
... It's a half hour single camera comedy for NBC. John Enbom, who did "Party Down", adapted it from a very funny BBC series...
So my pilot, Free Agents, got picked up! Not sure yet whether it's fall or mid-season. Gotta say I really like this show. So, ya know, yay.
@nitinmadhvani Sure if you want to come play...
@thesillysully Hey Sarah we miss u too
@OzLady41563 sure! http://www.dtsla.org/   thanks...
@rmadler ok man...
@KenHCampbell thx Kenny!
Come Play My NL Holdem Charity Tournament 5/21@MY home Bel Air $1K buyin. No ReBuys. Crazy High End Prizes! Info JamieS@geffenplayhouse.com
Just waiting to see if my pilot gets picked up. Not the show I did for NBC, my aviator buddy is stranded out at the airport.
@TiniusArts I agree but that is going back a ways
@IdolCarson Hey Carson! We will try to make it
This Bin Laden news is fantastic. Can anyone remember the last time we got some un equivocal great news as a nation? I cannot...
Thanks for the Birthday wishes. 47 is officially late forties. Ah, well. At least my memory is still good. Did I mention my memory is good?
@evyp13 nice to meet you too, Evelyn. Sorry about no pic...
A lot of the 80's music I hated at the time, I love now, purely out of nostalgia. Even Wall of Voodoo.
... I meant MAY 17 ...
BTW, the pilot is called Free Agents (at least for now), and we won't know if it will make the NBC schedule til they announce it @March 17
Sorry for the late notice on the last tweet all you smurf enthusiasts... Keep in mind, I'm Gargamel...
Want to go to The Smurfs movie premiere this summer? Visit http://bit.ly/g8ZxYx & enter The Smurfs Face of The Fan¬Æ contest before 4/13.‚àô
Sorry I haven't tweeted in a while, been shooting an NBC pilot that I actually really loved. I'm always shocked when that happens...
@sweetrosen HA! Hi Stevie!!
@Alanstarzinski It shocked me
@sacontala Hello yourself
@thecliff72 Happy Birthday!!
"Cleaned your clock" means you got beat up, right? So if you actually clean a real clock do you say "I beat the crap out of this guy"?
Just saw a commercial for Reese's Peanut Butter Cup cereal. So, that exists.
There should be equivalents to karaoke, like getting drunk and welding in public.
I always wanted to play an evil chick: http://yhoo.it/gj7ed5
For the last 17 hours, I've been giving you all the silent tweetment.
Today's Tip: Keep your concubine away form your paramour, but let your trollop co-mingle freely with your harlot. Not sure about your floozy
Monty Python were The Beatles of comedy. Agree or disagree?
@DrBoWagner completely changed my life-- way different than most nutritionists. I wouldn't say it if it weren't true- DrBo.com- No fooling!
i think the past tense of tweet should be twote.
@RealAdamRose It wasn't me, I'm afraid...
Did u folks watch Party Down on Starz? If not, do so immediately. John Enbom Wrote most of them, he is doing the new NBC pilot I'm in...
Here's a thing i'll be doing: http://www.tvline.com/2011/03/hank-azaria-nbc-free-agents/
Have you ever woken up feeling like a Sith Lord? If you don't know what that is, the answer is probably yes.
@zombieninja420 Good ear! I am the chick, sir.
@Summitshasta Happy Birthday Terry!
@richeisen I need mediation, meditation and medication.
I'm trying to get my 21 month old son to agree to a new collective bargaining agreement, but I think we may be headed for a lockout.
Why stop at 10 nominees for best picture? Let's add 5 each year, 'til it would be faster just to list the 10 films NOT nominated.
@1stJoshRobinson Ha! We added that line at the last minute...
Remember when Cap'n Crunch and Cocoa Puffs were "part of a balanced breakfast"? I miss those delusional times...
As my sister once said when she was @ 5: I like pickles, just not enough to eat them.
The carrot isn't all that tempting, and I'm not that scared of a stick, so don't try either on me, dude. Seriously.
I'm having NFL withdrawal today. As a Mets fan, the coming spring holds no joy...
Claptrap is a word you don't hear that often. Good thing, too.
@JayKogen It's a wonderful place to play the flute I hear
The Toronto Raptors were originally The Cretaceous-Era-Land-Mass-That-Is-Today-The-Gobi Desert Raptors. Yeah, I wikipedia'd that one...
By popular demand: the LA Lakers. The Indianapolis colts is ridiculous, for that matter.
You know what annoys me? Pro teams that move and then their name makes no sense: the Utah Jazz, the Arizona cardinals, etc.
@jeremybgg we just had a huff reunion dinner the other night
@DirtyJerdyArt was that you??
@gedhead it means beach. it's pronounced "pl-eye-ya"
@patricia_pr a litttle, yes. my parents do.
Today my friend accidentally mispronounced the spanish word "playa." He said it like a gangsta would say "playuh." We all laughed at him.
@Lardmeister It was called "Sexual Perversity in Chicago" by David Mamet. Ta ta.
Please check this out, in honor of the great Greg Giraldo's memory: http://www.nationalyouthrecovery.com/ggfund.html
@AstonishingSod genuine lol on that one!
People have to start using the word "epic" less , and start using the word "imbroglio" more. These are unrelated thoughts.
Morning! My son isn't up yet. It's that 12 minutes of time you have to yourself before the tidal wave hits!
I watched Beverly Hills Cop in my insomniatic haze last night and ya know what? That movie holds up.
@Gran2 just happy feet 2
This is admittedly weird, but I'm picking the Jets to win this Sunday.
Looky here if u haven't already, kids: http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/7d1f3b33e7/gamechangers-ep-3-a-legend-in-the-booth-with-hank-azaria
Sorry about the soup thing, everyone. It won't happen again... til next wednesday, 'cause wednesdays are like soup!!! SOUP I TELLS YOU!!!
@KDoggers @target @wescraven @DwightHoward ... I feel I have a lot in common with Target, dude.
There were many wonderful entries, but the correct answer is: Wednesday are like a bowl of soup because... noodles are often involved!!
Wednesdays are like a bowl of soup... you guys figure it out.
Beans have weird names. Like Garbonzo, Fava, Mung, and Steve.
congratulations to steeler nation!! great game...
my 19 month old son's prediction?... "bwajaff!" There was a "j" in there, so I'm going JETS JETS JETS!!!!!!!
jets and steelers will be close, thats the best i can call it...
i kinda saw this pack domination coming...
Ok folks, in all seriousness, GO JETS!!!!!
It's poker night, kids.
They weren't really freaking out, in fact everything was so calm that I wanted to shake things up by tweet-lying, or "twying".
Everyone in my house is freaking out.
Did you guys see on 60 minutes a few weeks ago that every single state in our country will be bankrupt this year?...  Comforting.
J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS!!! I gotta admit, I panicked the first quarter of that game...
@dionshawn Two words: Ken O'Brien
@sobeditor You're not wrong, sir.
Ha! 2 people unfollowed me after my Jets tweet!
I'll be happy tomorrow if the Jets don't beat themselves, hit Brady in the mouth once or twice, and keep it close going into the 4th quarter
No, really. @KevinPollak told me this is how it works.
Welcome new followers! Let's all kiss!!
