just to be clear @Erik_Seidel stole my phone this morning
zero chance this makes it to pokernews top social events of the week.. but guaranteed a photo of Jeff Gross Playing badminton on a yacht will be front and center. second story is that Bill Perkins bet Jeff gross he couldn‚Äôt make it in pro badminton. bad bet bro. gross is bauce
@xxl23 second tip most tournaments are all 12 year olds so remember to avoid swearing or to use adult truths like Santa is fake to throw them off their game . used to not be a rule for that. Didn‚Äôt go well.
@xxl23 of course trues! ur so cool! I‚Äôm considering a move into Pok√©mon cards, down to talk strat if u wanna mix it up. first tip: bulbasaur super underrated
please switch on ur implanted thoughtbox now. ty for uploading the latest version. we promise the thoughts we give u will seem normal to people u want to like u. have a nice day human 464728. the future is crazy dude ... not cuz technology but mostly cause.. it‚Äôs never the future
@Edmoney111 Twitter is the trick that society plays on ppl to convince them their power here is equivalent to power in the real world. Power over putting down ur phone and just working towards what u want instead of surveying what everyone else wants and choosing one of those ppls paths
this week in poker social: everyone just stares at eachother until they can decide if they‚Äôre German , if so, fold, if scandi call, if 76 years old and from Boston and first live tournament, raise
@Poker01234 I didn‚Äôt watch that show so in my mind its Niles from Frazier dumping the bucket and the annoying voiced chick from will and grace laughing as ray screams in pain from an ice cube hitting his eyeball directly, this particular ice bucket challenge gets more views than lebrons
ok thats It. we‚Äôre fucking done
@Poker01234 thank u yes, once u hashtag something, it becomes a movement, and once u start a movement, remember everything u can accomplish, u can even get Ray Romano to dump a bucket of ice on his head, like think about how much the world really needs stuff like that
@Poker01234 Itl be referred to as trump twitter and itll literally just be trump is only account with 3 billion followers and he just tweets fake science about how mars is only inhabitable by orange german Elites and Elon musk dude and we‚Äôre stuck back on earth and that one Pluto colony smh
@Poker01234 not a question and yes.. like some words u can repeat and it literally sounds like an alien language ... like barf is a word dude? barf? That sounds like a show about a slimy puppet alien that lands in a friendly Utah family‚Äôs home and changes their life foreva but like barf cmon
@Poker01234 America likes kids in drag, slap a wig on ur daughter, have her sing baritone and right before he finale reveal that she‚Äôs a girl and she‚Äôs going to have a super confusing time with her identity in high school and likely through her entire career as a stewardess for Spirit
this why I don‚Äôt tweet that much cause it‚Äôs just a lot of words and I really strive for them to not make sense , Please don‚Äôt understand this and unfollow me, this rant is a big ego move and I just feel super elder millennial
@chimp_poker ur rely clogging the feed but again I got to answer everything based on sponsor pressure so ye best rap verse the 1 I spit to Obama when we golfed that 1 time honestly rapeye dont look or sound right and Im not admitting to having rape-eye. best live tell: when they have rapeeye
honestly regular twitter gonna be super pointless when Elon musk releases psychic twitter wher ppl just think their thoughts towards a magnetic orb that swirls that energy into a 5th dimensional plane that only Elon can see and he will immediately know what these bitches thinking
@chimp_poker I‚Äôll freestyle battle rap anyone who challenges me within the next 4 years on twitter but after that I promise I‚Äôm logging off and going back to Carmen San Diego the level where ur in Spain and u have to find the stone with the engraving actually don‚Äôt really remember that game
@chimp_poker Im compelled to answer everyone tweet st me right now so yea ur hogging the frequencies a little bit here but it‚Äôs early sure and at least that one had a question it It thanks
@Poker01234 ok heres what we do u gonna sit in 1-2 with $100 pick up AA vs KK vs QQ vs QQ .. win that next hand hit a royal flush for a bad beat jackpot and just at the moment u also get a call that ur son made it onto America‚Äôs got talent and he‚Äôs guaranteed 10k for straight performance fee
@fanexfox private coaching from me because I steer u in the right direction , whereas non private coaching material will be helpful but not always congruent with what ur game really needs in that moment
@chimp_poker these still aren‚Äôt questions and I hate twitter but I love twatting so that‚Äôs a dilemma
@chimp_poker Srsly sirius
Kevin Hart has a huge dick
and everyone‚Äôs worried about left and right but that is an illusion , all their really is is truth and untruth . twitter is not true, it gives a platform to the biggest deceptors in the world. unfortunately technology makes things easier but also to an unnatural and fake extent
The more u label urself the more u lose ur free will and power to be an ever changing life form that is not hindered by being defined, the power in that is the total freedom to grow into anything u want to be without anyone else‚Äôs perception effecting it at all
ur twitter profile is as much u as the piece of paper created when ur born. ur immediately grandfathered In to a digital society where you‚Äôll be compulsed to make sure as much of ur identity has become digitized as possible, but that‚Äôs not really u that just ur idea of urself
basically used to tweet rants about politics and deep truth conspiracy shit But  like everyone‚Äôs big real mistake is to show all of their cards before the game begins, why should all these random ppl know ur exact politics. they can then box u into categories and use it against u
@Poker01234 Also not a question. But yes I am a life coach, and for now u just owe me 80$ for that pro bono job I just gifted u ur welcome
@GottaRaiseYa thats not a fking question. This is an ask me anything not a tell me anything. I don‚Äôt want to know facts or how ur feeling please just ask me questions because my answers are all super important and after this I‚Äôm leaving twitter and booting my old AIM screen name back up a/s/l?
@chimp_poker Oklahoma cause of the play. Best poker memory winning 1.5 million dollars in one month at 21, worst poker memory , 4 years later walking home from blackjack session cause no money for cab :( Third Eye for sure ... her whispering eye
@Tommytapwater i literally never stop freesryling , and nobody in poker or close to poker will ever beat me freestyling.. ever .. not possible. no writtens
@Poker01234 This what u do u put the 1k in n envelope go to the mailbox, tell someone that u need to send that 1k to an African prince to collect an inheritance but he need 10k from some1 else to prove loyalty, they will agree, trade the envelope with 1k for the 10k.. promise to email them
really haven‚Äôt felt like tweeting in a while so we got just 15 minutes left of this AMA and then I‚Äôm going back to MySpace exclusively
Twitter game like my poker game I play tihht and under the radar for a while and then at the precise moment I 5bet shove J7o into 80 year old mans AA and river quad sevens and he doesn‚Äôt get up cause he thought he won and I just feel really bad and go back in my shell fold fold
@xxl23 i am good. i miss u Xuan , ur d√©licate ambience and graceful awareness . Where are u and shall u be anywhere soon that I shall be, let me know now because again I‚Äôm leaving twitter for 3 months and I have no idea how to find anyone‚Äôs phone numbers without twitter like huh
@SavagePoker @GoldenKnights Upcoming poker is il hitting Europe for the first time in a while to egotistically chase easier bracelets ... I will attend as many knights games as Negreanu freerolls me too , and i am married and i been married to the game since I was a young thug to answer specifically
@GottaRaiseYa I would say the Omaha variants yes , NL holdem has the widest range of skill however and there‚Äôs more room for growth than other games. It‚Äôs the purest game and he best players therefore have the biggest edge compared to their edge in mixed games plo etc where variance is diffrnt
would I even be doing this rant if I had 5 followers is it just to be heard and the hope that these ideas spread , or do we just have a compulsion to visualize our thoughts when they come up so we can understand them .. but when u transform that thought, it loses its originality
the problem with fame is that the more famous u become u often lose urself to the court of public approval u stop making decisions for urself n u stop being what everyone expects u to b and it‚Äôs easier to lose sight of what actually makes u powerful control of ur mind and spirit
Everyone‚Äôs worried about being unliked or unpopular but everyone ends up dumbing down or changing their own thoughts on twitter to ensure most approval . it‚Äôs really the feeling of power to control people that famous people and politicians feel, and some get addicted to
I either end up wanting to write something absurd and irrelevant or wantin to go on some rant that I feel self conscious about cause it‚Äôs the same ego that is hurting society that I see in my need to justify my absence from twitter who cares if u leave twitter it‚Äôs not ur family
it‚Äôs sort of this weird seesaw between clever quick snippets of our egotisticsal thoughts mixed with strained attempts at political argument and endless convincing arguments. everyone‚Äôs hoping that everyone will think like them but words don‚Äôt really change people, events do
its great for marketing and self promotion but that‚Äôs a problem, an icon or political figure can easily use this medium to implant thoughts to blind followers taking tweets as fact. No matter how powerful the tweeter, it dont make what they say more legitimate. often the opposite
i Just feel like it‚Äôs a semi fucked junkyard of thought blurbs that can later be used against u out of context
honestly twitter became the least appealing social cause its just ur thoughts documented like what‚Äôs the point except to be a digital replacement for ur mind altogether, u can do stuff without needing everyone to witness it, if u really have a gem of insight make a show or a song
@brutalmasterdfs honestly wasting this question on this precious ama is an amateur move. super childish to not know that I‚Äôve been a fart smella since 92. stop fucking around
@jvferg72 well, virtue signals have been around since the days of Robert Varkonyi&gt; His home town in Wisconsin is actually where Bonomo was born, and is a notorious virtue signal hub . not much we can do here it‚Äôs just how it works, once u top all time money list u return home with dick out
20 minutes ask me anything , literally anything , then I‚Äôm back off twitter again for a few months
better than Kevin Hart even lets fucking go twitttter we‚Äôre back
best rapper in poker, nobody else close
wow things were really woke today on Twitter
convos getting real woke on twitter
@theczar19 whoa Bry this tweet was really woke... it defi‚Äô woke me up, and undoubtedly woke the nation to what they needed to be woken to. i only hope we all can woken up to what needs to be woke and to be able to seperate the woke from the un-woke. tonight while I sleep I‚Äôll still be woke

@Annakhait crack
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber agree to disagree. Good talk. We'll tell your Dad it was a tie üòÑ
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber change isn't some big switch that flips and everything is immediately different. spread of ideologies creates change
@ToddBrunson changes first must come in the mind and often big changes come gradually - things change even if it's not reported on CNN
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber if u feel forced into a choice through government pressure than the mind control is workin govern(control)ment(mind)
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber this is how the system is maintained through propaganda and illusion of choice.. caging people into groups
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber two options for president doesn't mean two options of the mind: other option: support neither.. think differently
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber not wanting one thing doesn't mean you are actively supporting the other thing. that's a trap of the mind
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber both heavily heavily influenced by special interests. that's the position they are in. Trump just more troubling..
@ToddBrunson @JayFarber disagree, but that shows how flawed the system is, two hands of the same corrupt machine. illusion of choice
@TexDolly no need to win.. Pretty impossible to change minds in small time frame that are set on something. Only wish to express points
@JayFarber @ToddBrunson vs. putting puppet figurehead candidates on a pedestal when they are really at mercy of special corporate interests
@JayFarber @ToddBrunson seems more beneficial to support ideas and concepts and a positive direction for the country ..
@JayFarber @ToddBrunson but I don't like supporting one, just because the other is "worse"
@JayFarber @ToddBrunson vote neither if u don't want to support corruption and a flawed system, or vote lesser of two evils to keep one out
@ToddBrunson people vote based on cult of personality and sound bytes and don't always see the true nature of politics or corruption
@ToddBrunson and honestly as bad as Trump is it's understandable that many Hillary voters were just voting against Trump at the core of it
@ToddBrunson yes in the sense that they don't care to truly know about the candidates or they choose the least corrupt in their eyes
@ToddBrunson Blinded by propaganda, unaffected by corporate corruption, or voting against Trump
@ToddBrunson all three of those options are pretty shitty in the grand scheme of democracy and goodwill for mankind
@ToddBrunson people who voted for him were either blinded by propaganda, racist and awful themselves, or just voting against Hillary..
@ToddBrunson Agree. But just cause he was elected doesn't mean any decent human shouldn't want him out of office b4 country gets worse
@ToddBrunson wanting to overthrow a terrible corrupt racist human doesnt seem hypocritical, just seems like said ppl care about the country
@ToddBrunson its not hypocrisy cause why wouldnt people want to overthrow him? He's an awful neo-nazi inciting human, no other reason needed
basically just be grateful u weren't aborted
if u were adopted be grateful that u were chosen instead of just stuck with the parents who had u
happy thanksgiving be grateful u weren't adopted

just blinked my eyes again
the last two tweets were kind of contradictory so I may post a blog about the Instagram photo that was just posted on my tumblr to explain
scratch that i think the amount of tweets is fine but after this one I'll direct you guys to my Instagram for a photo of a few more tweets
maybe the last tweet wasn't excessive cause there may have been some confusion about the fourth tweet, might delete account and start over
actually in the tweet before the other tweet I did say I would keep you guys posted so that original tweet is fine but this one is excessive
in all fairness that last tweet should count as an actual tweet so let's pretend it wasn't tweeted in the first place and move on please
decided on not doing another tweet. this tweet doesn't count this is just a tweet update to make sure people knew I wasn't gonna tweet again
might tweet again soon, haven't decided. keep u guys posted hang tight

@DarryllFish i join u fishy
@chirp_monster busting ladies event close third, followed by the day I broke both my legs accidentally walking into a jagged ravine
busted WSOP main event . they say it's the worst day of year for a poker player but I consider it a close second to the day I got AIDS
Goodnight, you princes of the Main, you kings of New England
@Expherience decent strategy although if you are one moment too late you may have to fork over 20k up to you sir high variance line

@PokerNewsFrance üíñüíñ
also giving 100% of my main event action away to first person to retweet this and then buy in with 10k for me and then play the event for me
@TenEightSuited if u take 10% I can get it to you for 6.3
@BoomBoomGoddard always yes thank u
sold out
selling main event action at 6.0 markup I will win i really think I may probably win , will lower to 5.9 for larger pieces
Busted to Kathy Leibert on the final table bubble, she called my flop shove with bottom pair and held, then laughed as I exited my chair
instead of bust the ladies event I've decided to disqualify myself and forfeit my chips -- the noble thing to do.. Lulz jk I bluffed it off
Nooo lost most of my chips to @kittykuopoker .. I 4bet folded QQ pre .. She showed me Q7 off and says "Go ur side!" - shortstacked now
Chip leader in the ladies event - 30 players left --
.. Wow looks like some other dude played the ladies event too.. What a dumbfuck .. There can only be one
wow sick spinup, whole table left early for break including @xxl23 .. they thought I busted but had a single chip behind .. 10xed my stack..
... Turn is a king giving me quads, and river is a queen K92KQhhh giving the first limper a straight flush.. I'm down to one chip.. ;/
2nd limper rejams 4x pot.. 3rd limper folds, 4th limper snap calls, i snap call, All three of them have TJ suited...
.. I decide to make it 7K at 500-1k bb.. 4 of the Limpers call.. Flop comes K92 rainbow.. I check .. First limper jams all in for 3x pot..
Fuckk had heaps then just had this hand, lady under the gun limps , everyone limps behind her to me in the big blind, I look down at KK..
@Annakhait sorryy I'll make it up to youu..  shouldn't have called ur 38 bb shove with A6off
in the money of the #ladiesevent with 80bbs --
..and with that I'm one of the chip leaders and were nearing the money soon leggooo #ladiesevent
... "I call!" She says, and tables 73hh for seven high, busted flush draw. "My friend think u have 5 high" .. Fortunate spot to double...
..in fear of giving off tells. Floor gets to table as she puts phone away, she's issued a one hand penalty after her river decision...
...She pulls out her phone as dealer calls for floor and gets her friend on the phone and listens, all the while I remain still...
..and then says "I call!!.." I start to turn my hand over and she continues "i call my frend ask her what I do n this spot!!" ...
..and calls, river is a Ten board is AK46T i brick my 8-high flush draw, she checks I snapshove all in for 15k, she tanks for 9 minutes...
..flop comes AK4hh bringing me a flush draw, she checks I cbet 1450 she calls, turn is a 6 she checks, I bet 3675 she tanks for 2 minutes..
sickk hand just now in this ladies event 300-600 it folds to me on button I make it 1300 with 82hh, Asian lady in big blind calls...
..lady on button then snaps folds also and shows AA no club .. sick triple up legggo #ladiesevent
...into 6k pot.. Middle position snap folds and shows KK no club - floor is called over and she gets a round penalty for showing her hand..
..which is capping my cards. Lady in middle position flats the 3bet and we see a flop of 678 all clubs.. I shove my last 100 chip...
..she min raises to 400,  folds to button who 3 bets to 1900. I look down at AKhh and slide my chips in but forget my last 100 chip..
move to a new table in ladies events.. was pretty short with 2k in the big blind then got pretty lucky in this hand! Lady in mid position..
gg @Luscious_Lon .. Sick beat yo.. gl in main. #ladiesevent
...checks her cards and snap calls... Old lady in small blind turns over J6off, @Luscious_Lon has AA. Flop A74, turn 3, river 5.........
..i fold, @Luscious_Lon finally has stopped tweeting , looks up at the action and realizes the small blind shoved.. She checks her cards...
..looks confused and says angrily "u called clock on me?!? All in!" she shoves all her chips in.. Folds counterclockwise around to me utg..
..i realize what's happening and say "whoa guys ur playing counter clockwise wtf", original raiser in small blind looks confused..
..the button checks her cards and makes it 2500, cutoff decides to flat, highjack flats, folds to me under the gun..
..All of a sudden before any preflop action the elderly woman in the small blind shouts "raise!" and makes it 1200...
whoaa pretty interesting hand at my ladies event table! @Luscious_Lon  is in big blind distracted on her phone tweeting..50-100 level...
Have @Luscious_Lon at the table and the rest fish. Leggo #LadiesEvent

@Uber_Support should an Uber passenger ever be forced to sit in the front?
@PokerInMontreal Yes I'm here. So they do that cause taxi cops will stop them for no reason or they do it cause they are sketchy
is it sketchy that my uber driver kept insisting i get in the front? really didn't want me in the backseat.. i got out .. thoughts
ok the dealer finally stopped staring at me - *ends 3 hour tank* * folds*
peripheral vision is a thing maybe glance at me when i start moving my hand or something at least give me like 6 seconds to breathe
do dealers really have to stare directly at you the entire time like really

just to clarify, fuck trump
Vote Trump! politicians are great role models, they never lie, elections aren't rigged at all. the president isn't a puppet figurehead nahh
The Donald's last name begins with Tru... the man cannot and has never told a lie. It's tru, do some fact checking and you'll see
any arguments for Bernie or Hillary are Trumped by Donald's exceptional qualifications haha see what i did there it makes sense tho
when looking at candidates, think if you would want that person babysitting your kids. i look at Trump and I say take them to Disneyland sir
Poll: Who will you vote for in the upcoming election? A. Trump B. Trump C. Donald Trump D. all of the above
if I haven't swayed you to vote Trump yet I don't think anything will to be honest
all u people against Trump cause of his supposed racism and sexism, how is that even fair?! Trump has a race and a sex, u can't dislike him
so what if Trump has a few failed businesses, this isn't a business it's just a country! he won't even have to figure out a logo or anything
How could u not like walls? Only terrorists dislike walls. Are u a terrorist? Vote for Trump
those of you against Trump's building of walls.. Look to ur left, look to ur right., what do u see? Walls! There are walls everywhere!
One time Trump wrestled a grizzly bear to its untimely death to save a helpless family of twelve. Would Hillary do that? Most likely no
A vote for anyone other than Trump is a vote for terrorism. I'll explain why soon. My logic is sound
Trumps got values. He has morals. The guy has class. Also , great hair. The total presidential package
Trump Trump Trump! Vote for Trump!
@MattGlantz ur logic and reasoning about Trump has swayed me to your corner. I'm voting for Trump this year, thanks for showing me the light

got some good responses to the poll earlier about having AA in the big blind .. The correct decision is fold, no other option is reasonable
POLL: You're at the WSOP Main Event final table and have AA in the big blind and are facing 8 all-ins, you have everyone easily covered --

yes that was an old school mattias andersson joke -- u best be knowing bout him
@JohnnyBaxPoker ha dude i don't tweet that much just when I rant i try keep it loose aggressive like Trump or Hellmuth or Mattias Andersson
end rant goodnight Zuckerberg zz
so a future politician could use my own words against me if i was ever powerful enough for them to care about my politics.. which i won't be
the irony of the rant is that me posting here is in a partial way giving liscense of my ideas to those in power -- it's here digitally 4eva
Kevin Hart has a short attention span
just follow me tho please be my loyal followers through 10 more years of Kevin Hart classics
see that Kevin Hart joke was just an idea it wasn't about politics or getting you guys to believe anything
leo got his oscar finally wow seems like an upset i woulda gone with Kevin Hart from Ride-along 3
enjoy Donald Trump for his meme but stop thinking that he's a human anyone should actually want to become one day..
on the surface its about connecting us but politically,social media is part of what's dividing us, Powerful people know 'divide and conquer'
for some people , Twitter is for their ideas .. Others it's about politics .. Social media is a political tool as a whole..
oh shittt dude I didn't say get married. erryone listen to me, i am a politician RT @Demaree88: @JeffMadsenobv my WIFE watches with me.

'Government' after all, literally is translated from "mind control".. Stop following people .. Make ur own life and mind.. Have ur own ideas
the entire thinking about what the world needs has to change .. And the evil has to somehow be overcome .. It starts in people's minds ..
are about hating your opponent in the election.. it's war on a smaller scale .. The world doesn't need more war .. Just truth and good ..
greed power and hate control everything. it's clear in the election process itself, to be elected all ... https://t.co/1RSYaZfUeL
obama is a 'cool' guy - but if u see less evil ther then Trump then ur perception of the system is that he could keep his morality within it
Trumps just an extreme example and a clearly awful human- but a man who portrays himself as good to the masses and hides his nature is worse
elected officials have to be elected- the political game turns runners into characters - you do not know these people - the system is flawed
Trump is a great example of why you shouldn't look up to or be a follower of ANY politician -- look up to and follow ideas/ideologies solely

..down chains of command and responsibility for wrongdoing can become completely muddled in the truth's journey through an army of lies..

@RealKidPoker ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@RealKidPoker seems like you keep trying to simplify complex situations into yes or no or black and white polling. too much politics --&gt;&gt;
@RealKidPoker seems like "you love them both" should be an option in the polling
@NichoelJurgens @RealKidPoker Haha. Everyone likes a heated debate, that's why these questions are posted publically. Dnegs is my neggaa
@RealKidPoker Either u love them or u don't. u may interpret the love in different ways
@RealKidPoker if u loved either parent u wouldn't answer this question and degrade the spouse -true love is unconditional. not a contest

@RealKidPoker @MattGlantz It's just unfortunate to know a lot of ppl don't realize that the mainstream media is lying ALL THE FUCKING TIME
@RealKidPoker @MattGlantz All this grouping of arbitrary generalities is a means of divide and conquer. World issues are much more complex
@RealKidPoker @MattGlantz The world is individuals, with different minds and objectives. The real entities are the corporations &amp; politicos
@RealKidPoker @MattGlantz the "left" and the "right" -tiring to hear discussions about entities that dont actually exist outside of the mind

all u need to live is food and water everything else is propaganda create anything u want
i love my blackness, and yours
hey
feeling spirited
@RealKidPoker we can agree that some people are just more intelligent and can look at ppl from a balanced realistic perspective bottom line
@RealKidPoker Ppl will use race to stereotype, but in the modern world, all the other factors are more valuable in judging a person
@RealKidPoker obv our brains make judgements based on what we see, it's just important to separate race from appearance from attitude/energy
@RealKidPoker If ur talking about racism u shouldnt b including the words suit headphones fit old young overweight etc, muddles the argument
@RealKidPoker U can talk about stereotypes but it seems a big part of ur argument is non-race characteristics of appearance --
@RealKidPoker to be fair it seems like a few of ur tweets are talking about clothes, physical fitness, things that are not race --
@RealKidPoker üíåüíå
@RealKidPoker Sayin Asians are good at math may cause an Asian who isn't good at math to feel a form or racism that isnt intended originally
@RealKidPoker each comment must be viewed independently and the intent of the comment or discussion is relevant. Can be lots of grey area
@RealKidPoker which I know u aren't saying- but even saying Asians are good at math is a form of mild, light, racism
@RealKidPoker U didn't say that but claiming that racism is only negative comments about a race implies that that kind of statement is fine
@RealKidPoker definitely wrong on this one, ur implying that saying whites are the best race and are superior isn't racist in any respect...

@JayFarber and some awful ignorant people become famous because they have a single talent or quality that mistakenly makes them a role model
@JayFarber the media packages characters in a neat little box, meanwhile nobody watching learns anything about being an actual good human
@JayFarber people now are focused on surface gimmicks and appearance because that's what sells - most of it is fake - nobody sees underneath
@JayFarber fame and blind idol worship in the world today lead to a sect of powerful people with less accountability and less compassion
@JayFarber hopefully one day ppl will realize that fame and popularity mean nothing in regard to the actual quality of an individual

üë∂üèæRT @Jamesnou: Just had the most blessed phone call with @JeffMadsenobv they say don't meet your heroes but I'd recommend this one tbh
Drunk dial opportunities very rare occurrence reply with phone # and u will possibly recover words of wisdom and drunken ramblings
probably for the best I'm out of the main-- Haven't spent enough quality time at Sapphire lately
the #grind never ceases
it hurts a lot but was a great summer -- busting the main just suckkksss -- slowly hitting me. Ouchie
@CodyShedd @KiKaMo88 u guys both won $10! I hope the pain of my bust out is worth the joy u both will feel spending your Madsen dollars üò≠üò≠
The correct answer was "0" -- busteddd üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Ok third round last chance to make some money for $10 what's my exact chip count on the last break of the night
hint for next time, the lowest denomination chips are 25s
I'll go to the judges RT @olegsmith: @JeffMadsenobv was I close enough to earn 60? #gottotry
Looks like @jflo505 was closest - only 300 off ! Great showing - no money this time, but you've won a bag of kittens. It'll be on ur porchüêà
times up -- the correct stack size was 25,350
ok round two, for $100 guess my exact main event chip count on dinner break, one guess per person or DQ'ed -- goooo ---&gt;
Fellow gaucho! Very karmic RT @MillerHiiiLife: @JeffMadsenobv Damn. I'll take the good luck, and lend a week of it to you, UCSB brother.
Also shoutout to the people who guessed my chips as "0" and also those who guessed numbers that aren't a multiple of 5.. #toughtowin
@MillerHiiiLife was the closest, no money this time but u win an honorable mention and 7 years of good luck. More pointless contests soon -
times up the correct exact response was 18,125 --
side note if u cheat and physically see me at the table and count my chips that's not cool bro
for no apparent reason ima give $100 to anyone who can guess my current exact chip count on break in the main event. One guess per person üë®

#kitteh party tonight
Busted the Ladies Event in epic fashion I jammed with AK UTG and get called in 8 places , lose to the big blind's 94off üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
..down to 36 now; the chip leaders are being hard-headed about this chop.. They want mani-pedi's from the Korean Salon nearby, paid in full
..the chip leaders were unwilling to budge on the food voucher stipulation.. Looks like we are playing down to 36 and renegotiating
they're partly on board with 63-way chop but small stipulation places 64-87 get a percentage of final-tablists future food &amp; drink vouchers
deep in the #ladiesevent right now, the field is discussing an 87-way chop, I am trying to convince them to be reasonable and wait til 63
#kittehsweats üê±üê±üê±üê±üê±üê±üê±üê±üê±üê± #chipleader #ladiesevent #distractingpussy
in turn none of them returned to their seats and I was able to steal blinds and antes for the last two hours..The #kitteh is too distracting
.. i pulled out my little #kitteh from my little #kitteh #backpack.. Clearly none of the ladies could resist - they all gathered to pet it
developed a new strategy for going deep in this #ladiesevent - just worked perfectly.. After dinner break as the ladies returned to table..
.. we take selfies and they both exit the tournament room #ladiesevent
..they show 7TJQhhss for a busted full wrap double flush draw and pair draws- I scoop the massive pot and eliminate both of them #livereads
..i call the 7k. Turn is a 4 , board is 8934hhss. They bet 19k, I call. River is an Ace of clubs, they jam 50k+ into me, I snap call with 22
so they are playing a 4 card PLO hand vs. me.. "Only fair", I say. The flop comes 893hh.. They both check, I c-bet 1500.. They raise to 7k..
..pissed at me for playing the Ladies Event while also having a penis.. To soothe their tempers I tell the blinds they can share their hands
sick spot just now, I raise to 800 UTG with 22, both women in the blinds call, all of us have over 50k. side note my table is pissed at me..
..they take a brief selfie as Seat 3 exits the tournament room #ladiesevent
Seat 7 points to her red Ace and says "Diamonds are Forever" ...Seat 3 nods in agreement and forfeits her half of the pot to seat 7 ...
..Seat 3 shows two black Aces, and everyone gasps -!- the board runs out clean - but as the dealer goes to chop the pot, Seat 7 ..
..who lets out a large sigh and goes into the tank for 17 minutes, finally she says 'lets gamble' and calls, showing two red Aces...
..seat 7 goes into the tank for 5 minutes and 3bets to 400...back to lady in seat 3 who instantly shoves for 10k... on seat 7 now who ..
wow interesting hand at my table early in the #ladiesevent - ! - lady to my right in seat 3 min-raises to 200, we all fold to seat 7 ..
late regging the ladies event #letsgo

@stealthmunk yea it's not like I manipulated the system to play this. I've been working on @bicyclecasino live webcast - live at the bike
bein eligible to play this this year is interesting - I'm literally a casino employee and I wanna play a fun warmup event - why not. Goo
if anything, this will start a conversation - and the trolls will care more than they should, as usual
@stealthmunk  if this gets other players to contribute to poker content and coaching/outreach at their home casino, that's in good spirit

advanced poker workshop - 1 week from today @bicyclecasino http://t.co/vNoYDwbixV
me and @alex_dreyfus just talked it out we decided to just make @AllenKessler this year's WSOP POY and be done with it
the Wsop POY should be about well rounded players, but a dominant NL player should stand a chance too - it should be a NL Vs mixed battle
it's good promotion for WSOP for an amateur player to believe he has a chance at POY by crushin the NL events that dominate most of schedule
i love @alex_dreyfus and the GPI i was just saying that usually when casinos have POY stuff, the whole series is weighted more evenly
i love the WSOP obv but they have to weight the POY better to encompass the relative difficulty of each event
the field is weaker in large field no-limit events obviously, but the difficulty of winning them is equal or tougher to winning mixed events
the WSOP should retain some integrity and balance their focus of Branding and Marketing with a more level POY system
the WSOP is more concerned with a high profile player winning POY than the POY race actually being a fair competition across the board
the new WSOP POY point system is awful

@SavagePoker @Greenblatt1 oh well of course I agree with , if onto next hand then it's too late -- that's obv as well - rematch soon Alex üòÖ
@Greenblatt1 @SavagePoker And yea I haven't seen a deck flipped post hand either - also haven't played a hand with unshuffled deck before
@Greenblatt1 @SavagePoker wordd its grey until the point we realize deck is unshuffled - he had a good eye - glad he caught tainted deck
@Greenblatt1 @SavagePoker in our hand i think a chop is clearly correct ruling -- clearly unshuffled deck, very unfair to one player obvvv

@_JeannieDuffy it was! goodnight.  quitting twitter for a week.  #endrant
@_JeannieDuffy we think of animals as more lovable and better in ways , but when a human is acting 'animalistic' its a negative connotation
@_JeannieDuffy in the sense that they act based on survival and emotion and don't have a good conscience or understand morality..
@_JeannieDuffy i agree with you on most stuff.. it's just ironic to me that some of the "worst" people can be "animalistic" in a way..
@_JeannieDuffy some people's conscience might suggest that they do something "bad" for a justification that me or u couldn't relate to.
@_JeannieDuffy if a giant hippo eats ur family, do you still love the hippo?  did it know better? did it make a choice? what's it's morality
@_JeannieDuffy i like dogs better often too haha. they so cute and fluffy. but sometimes i see a dog i don't like and i kick it. ya know
@_JeannieDuffy i agree with u that our human intelligence makes morality essential, and some people are awful, but nobody is born like that
@_JeannieDuffy What if a person lying cheating stealing hurting is their own version of 'survival' - it's not "right" but it's their nature
@_JeannieDuffy every1 has their own version of right and wrong. we know what society expects but each human  follows their own natural path
@_JeannieDuffy  even awful people are simply living in their own natural state - we should still express love to all, hate perpetuates hate
@_JeannieDuffy agree partially, a human is 'taught' to be how they are by their environment and those around them throughout their life
love all things unconditionally - everything has its own nature - humans are more complex but we are still natural beings - do not hate
@cwsmichigan there should be no conditions for loving certain humans either - love should be based on the individual being
random rants
If a dog is raised in a bad environment and not taught love - it might be an awful animals that bites ur dick off
- never left the house , the baby would totally worship and love you unconditionally of course - all it knows is ur love
-- so what else could it know except what it's learned in its little furry life -- if u found a baby and took care of it and it never left
and I get that ok ur dog loves u more than anything and is there for you- but remember u essentially own it, it's grown up under ur control
,, what they are really trying to say is they dislike humans -- why don't u like humans ? We are awesome
My point wasn't that I'm saying I dislike animals, I love all beings - I just think when someone says they love animals more than humans ,,
- more intelligent beings are capable of a deeper understanding of one another - higher ceiling for true love
-- but there are some shitty animals too that do fucked up shit -- like eat you -- don't let certain humans ruin the whole population for u
-- and animals are less intelligent so less capable of being disliked as they do not have agendas besides eat and reproduce --
People who say the love animals more than humans must not like their family or themselves very much haha - sure, animals are simpler --
@Katieanderson05 is amazing at tweeting - best tweets in the biz
I'm here all week for #MarchMadness picks and insider information. My pick to go the distance is the Cats for sure. Ur welcome #MarchMadsen
&amp; Wow Johnson's dunk over Jones yesterday made Jackson's 3 over Wilson seem like Robertson's free throw attempt in the UPS championship game
don't get me wrong, the 9 seed matches up with prep better than the dogs match up with the wild catfish, look for an upset from smith &amp; crew
overall i played it safe and had the best 5 seeds at the bottom of the upper divisional preliminary playoff, leaving more room for state obv
my final 4 picks are the final four 4 seeds left as long as central makes it 4 rounds further than middle- if state beats country, watch out
basically things will heat up when north battles east because west would have to battle northeast if tech and prep aren't ready for coast
but if prep can hold off south, then north might upset uni, which would make the 2 8 and 13 seed favorites against the 24 28 and 47 seeds
my money's on city to beat state, and in the sweet 16 tech will notch country and have a close battle with prep to face village or town

@RealKidPoker @AllenKessler and hey I'm all for figuring this situation out we just have to avoid altering things too much besides the speed
@RealKidPoker @AllenKessler @jcinblue well no what about the player who made the bet? if this causes more calls, it def affects them too yoo

85k on dinner break WPT Sac
@RealKidPoker @AllenKessler  @jcinblue the dynamic of hands would change too much, and those not in the hand have the power to trigger it
@RealKidPoker @AllenKessler @jcinblue also this would affect the hand too much -- ppl would call a bit more often when clock on them,
@RealKidPoker @AllenKessler @RyanRiess1 @jcinblue if u incentivize with other benefits then every donk will call clock on Ivey to get info
@RealKidPoker @AllenKessler @RyanRiess1 @jcinblue agree but clock calling should be based on the individual's actual tanking and time taken
@AllenKessler @RyanRiess1 @RealKidPoker @jcinblue u can't add an extra motive for calling clock. Can't confirm clock-callers true reasoning.
@AllenKessler @RealKidPoker @jcinblue ha but what's "reasonable"? if there's added incentive of seeing hands more spots will be "reasonable"
@RyanRiess1 @AllenKessler @RealKidPoker @jcinblue lol awful idea Allen -- then players could just call clock in order to see other's hands

and that's what makes poker sick , it's a constant seesaw between what we think we are controlling and what is actually out of our hands
Basically my point is it's really easy to lose, anyone can do it on command if they wanted, but you can't just win on command ..
In poker winning is great.. but it's easy to lose back money, whereas when you lose , the situation doesn't seem as easily reversible
gambling is sick because the high of winning can never equal the low of losing

@WSOPTD don't see how someone can win the most coveted prize in poker without confirmation of legitimately doing it on their own w/o help -
@WSOPTD ur gonna watch everyone and make sure everyone's playing on their own account? And no one is helping one another? How is that real..
@WSOPTD so the WSOP is going to give an actual bracelet for an online event?? Am I missing something -- don't u guys see the issue with that

ahh, long day, think i'll sit down with a hot cup of tea and view some packaged information and live my life according to that ok
or do whatever you waant i'm just saying random shit right --- ?  or not
don't fear the truth , it opens your mind - don't block out the truth or the possibility that things get deeper just for temporary comfort
u have to follow information as close to the source as possible-- otherwise you're just experiencing a filtered version of reality via media
that, and, a lot of Americans have subconscious biases based on that same media's subtle programming of them throughout their lives
i guess the underlying problem is a decent part of America is still confused/misdirected by a media that they blindly have come to trust..
either thirst for the FACTS of a situation through various outlets that don't have extreme corporate and ideological bias, or ignore it all.
don't watch any television news and expect to get a realistic perspective of what's really going on in the US right now- avoid the brainwash
i love all those classic holiday traditions , ice skating naked, stealing bourbon from a neighbor , cussing out a mall Santa , etc
haven't done any of my Kwanzaa shopping yet

i will not be this years DW champion -- brutaaal
@JohnnyBaxPoker ok give me some expert DW strategy
Ur kicker is pretty important when it comes to preflop battles -- but post flop there is more crazy strategy -- a duece flopping is cray --
5 of a kind is better than a straight flush but worse than a royal -- having a duece in ur starting hand is key but there's some bluffing
this game is amazing -- so if u have 22 u show ur hand immediately and win the blinds antes and the button -- otherwise it's too unfair--
i MUST be the EPT prague dueces-wild champion .. this is the most important tournament of the year -- any professional knows this -

ok i want my brain back who took that shit fess up
quitting twitter for a while zzzzz
There's nothing wrong with experimenting with ur brain chemistry once in a while tho right haaaa-- maintain balance tho as ur view expands
Finally -- don't worry about the end -- it's the same place as the beginning -- it is the light of ur consciousness -- do not fear - peace
And if u study and absorb and learn -- u simply need to experience things - u don't need a clinic or a pill or anything except ur brain- try
Gain control over your own mind- remember that 'government' literally translates from 'mind control' put urself at the top of ur own pyramid
and yes I randomly decided to say motivational stuff geeeeeeez
-- also, don't give out too much advice -- people tend to only learn through experience -- but at least they'll remember u were helping
Don't let money control you -- be smart and master ur money so u can stop thinking about it for the rest of ur life because it destroys ppl
Also it's bullshit if u aren't doing what u love-- find what u love -- and practice -- and it shouldn't be hard to figure out how to make $
-- get motivated -- don't take the easy way out -- the reward isn't special .. It's a myth that u can't always have fun -- complete bullshit
be grateful and kind and respectful of life and of others and the possibility for change - life has peaks and valleys- don't get discouraged
--ur life is not like anyone else's in history so stop worrying about them and just chill in ur individual, flawed, awesomeness-- ur good
- don't be stuck in ur narrow point of view to protect ur ego or an idealistic image of how life should be -- takes chances- explore
and the people who think that is some new age bullshit that isn't grounded in reality -- don't understand the infinite nature of reality--
Remember life isn't always easy but life is fair - the universe balances ur energy and thoughts with whatever ur attracting - u are powerful
Loove--

i also have decided to amputate my arm and replace it with a bionic arm that shoots plasma beams like Mega-Man-- maybe 2+2 will do a forum
wow shocker people actually think i would throw weed onto the table and get 86'd from the rio.. i would never do that.. haha.. it was meth
Ok they've released me and allowed me to keep all my drugs #blessed
Busted PLO and then got immediately arrested and 86'd from the Rio for weed possession
Playing 10k PLO event .. Brought some marijuana with me to throw on the table mid-pot
Yo guys at the Rio make sure you ride @VooDooZipLine today, 25% of the proceeds go to the One Step Closer Foundation .. @1SCF

Busted the monster stack fuck life
Retweets concerning my epic run in yesterday's ladies event ::
Busted the ladies event near end of day but the wsop let me enter into the monster stack $1500 on day‚Ä¶ http://t.co/gGXNIw19l2
Some of them put their chips in their Gucci handbags, others in their Louis Vuitton duffel.. I tried to warn them.. Oh well
Looks like some ladies at my table have been disqualified.. Apparently they misunderstood the term "bagged" ..
.. Lady to her left min 5-bets.. gets back to me I make a 3x 6 bet..They all simultaneous complain and say 5 bets is the max in limit holdem
Built a big stack in the ladies event.. Mainly from this hand.. I raise AA utg, lady to my left min 3-bets, next chick min- 4 bets...
the ladies at my table think im Patrik Antonius..i convinced them somehow..i'm using this to get folds by offering selfies signed in Finnish
... they all snap fold for 1k more and I get the full triple up .. #phew #blessed
... then the chick to the left of her snap throws out 6k, and two others throw out 6k.. Dealer informs them all I'm actually all in for 7k..
Wow really fortunate spot.. I'm semi short and shove all in from mid position with 44 for 7k.. Lady next me throws out 6k...
...in fear that she may smell weakness. Regardless, she falls asleep and after 26 minutes her hand is ruled dead.. I'm  Sitting with 14k now
...and flips the channel to 'Murder She Wrote' starring Angela Lansbury. Midway through the episode I still haven't called clock in fear...
She goes deep into the tank.. After about 3 minutes she says "Oh! It's time for my stories!" -- she pulls out a mini television....
Flop comes AKQ, I c-bet half pot, she calls. Turn is the 9, I fire full pot, she calls. River pairs the 9, I shove all in..
Just got involved in a interesting hand with the 81 year old woman in seat 7.. She raises pre, I 3bet 82 off from the small blind, she flats
A quick glance at my ladies event table http://t.co/Fm8aGKn1zg
As seat 4 is exiting tournament area seat 3 exclaims to her "it's aquamarine, bitch"
.. She accidentally sees seat 3's hand.. Pocket 2's. Seat 4 shoves with 3's, folds to big blind who shows KK and lays it down.. Flop 223..
Wow sick hand right away seat 3 open shoves 4500 at 25-25 blind level, chick in seat 4 leans in to ask about seat 3's nail polish color ..
Hey guys I'm playing the Ladies Event again this year, I'll tweet some updates and interesting spots with you guys throughout the day
