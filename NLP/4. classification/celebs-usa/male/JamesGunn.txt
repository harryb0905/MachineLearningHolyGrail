5. Anyway, that’s the completely honest truth: I used to make a lot of offensive jokes. I don’t anymore. I don’t blame my past self for this, but I like myself more and feel like a more full human being and creator today.  Love you to you all.
4. For the record, when I made these shocking jokes, I wasn’t living them out. I know this is a weird statement to make, and seems obvious, but, still, here I am, saying it.
3. In the past, I have apologized for humor of mine that hurt people. I truly felt sorry and meant every word of my apologies.
2. It’s not to say I’m better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger.  My days saying something just because it’s shocking and trying to get a reaction are over.
1. Many people who have followed my career know when I started, I viewed myself as a provocateur, making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo. As I have discussed publicly many times, as I’ve developed as a person, so has my work and my humor.
@Cernovich It wasn’t the only tweet, it was a series. The next one I named the disgusting fuck. It was 2008 I wasn’t exactly an expert at Twitter.
@ImSuperCap @YourAvgBellman @johnny_ricardo @Cernovich @Disney In 2008 I barely knew how to work twitter.
@CC_the_martian @JackPosobiec Me too.
@dr2red @Cernovich @Disney I did a section for the Horror Book of Lists on favorite horror scenes. Other guys who had added pieces were also there, like Salva.
@JackPosobiec Same as to Cernovich - the point of the series of tweets was that I was fucking horrified I showed up to a reading and was there with a convicted pedophile, Victor Salva, the director of Jeepers Creepers. I left.
@Cernovich @Disney Yeah, that was the point of the tweets, dummy. I left. I showed up to the reading and there was a convicted pedophile there - Victor Salva, the director of Jeepers Creepers, and I was fucking horrified.
@YaLooking In terms of armed forces, they are at peace, were at peace, have been at peace for decades, and will continue to be at peace in the future. How does your brain compute that that has anything to do with our cyber security, or having a foreign operative as a President?
@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Exactly. And Trump is the one complaining about “fake news” while manipulating it, and lying, every chance he gets.
If you don’t think it’s a problem the U.S. Director of Intelligence is warning us about the actions of the President of the United States, you‘re brainwashed or dumb. Do you know how serious things must be for Coats to be repeatedly speaking out against Trump? It’s unheard of.
5) IF Obama HAD interfered in the election process of Israel (he didn't), then OF COURSE any Israelis who abetted this process should be tried and prosecuted, just as Trump should be here in the US. #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
4) This isn't about Trump interfering in another country's elections- that would be eminently wrong- but at least it would be something supposedly in the interest of the US. We're talking, instead, about Trump working in the interest of a foreign power.
3) The oft-cited-by-lunatics case of Obama interfering in Israel's election is truly unsubstantiated and unlikely. It's long and boring, but as Trumpies are prone to do, it has them making a lot of connections to Obama (and the State Department) that don't exist.
2) Not all countries do "meddle" (that is, attack another country's election process).
The other desperate Trumpie argument of the day (from a "GOP Strategist"). "Hey, ALL countries do it, so it's okay Trump colluded with Russia!" The reasons this is equally stupid AND heinous are many, including: 1) Duh, two wrongs don't make a right. https://t.co/0OYKBimzMo
@michelemorrow Absolutely.
Haha, "fuck Batman," oh man. https://t.co/Mm1W4chnaY
Trump supporters: STOP PRETENDING WE’RE ON THE BRINK OF WAR WITH RUSSIA AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING IT IS TRUMP’S SUBSERVIENCE ON THE WORLD STAGE. We aren’t now. We havent been for decades. It’s a completely made up issue to rationalize Trump’s treason and it makes you look dumb.
@bennylovesfilms The best!
@jenstatsky I feel the same thing every time I see him now.
So @YouWereNeverMov is an amazing film, cementing Lynne Ramsay as one of my favorite living filmmakers, based on the book by my old friend @JonathanAmes. Fantastic and moving.
@zachbraff @eliroth Perfect timing. I was just doing a Google search for this.
@andizeisler @RickDavers Maybe it was the moment in which I clicked on the trending topic but the ones I initially saw were not largely respectful. It was mostly asshole this and privileged knucklehead that. And Duplass had deleted the tweet already!! So why are people so mad??
@gaffneyfilm @EvanDickson Don't you think there's a chance he didn't know much about Shapiro &amp; just read the more levelheaded tweets? From everything I see about Duplass he seems like a good guy. He deleted the tweet! Not being all knowing doesn't make him an entitled knucklepuck; that just seems mean.
@andizeisler @RickDavers Obviously I'm not talking about people saying things calmly and straightforwardly. I was reacting to "fuck duplass" and "It makes Mark Duplass an asshole" etc etc (you can find those and many others by searching). That's what I saw when I clicked on the trending topic.
@Greevance_T @benshapiro Nope. I have no problem with bad grammar. I do have a problem with someone mocking someone for bad grammar while using bad grammar.
I’ve made many mistakes both on film &amp; off, @benshapiro. As for the asshole thing, I really don’t know who you are other than the guy who once made fun of a high-schooler for using incorrect grammar in a tweet where you yourself used incorrect grammar. So, you know, asshole. https://t.co/vlxDawhwh8
Nice threat. Go for it. I don’t think Duplass deserves to be attacked. If you want to question my character over that, go right ahead. https://t.co/cuTv60A8t0
@ccmaguire Because he’s trending on twitter and getting attacked and I don’t think that’s fair.
@AmericaFreeMind @KurtSchlichter This is a very strange thing to say in response to a tweet in which I say just because you disagree with someone doesn’t make that person evil.
I never said all my opponents are traitors &amp; racists, @KurtSchlichter. I just said there are a lot out there. If you don’t understand the difference you’ll undoubtedly have many more things in life end badly for you. https://t.co/L4PlgXJ8uB
@jasondashbailey The outrage is being expressed towards Duplass, not Shapiro. That's clear from what I'm saying.
Mark Duplass tweeting how you should follow an asshole because he thinks it's the kind thing to do simply can't be the bar for moral outrage.   Have a good day. 4/END
We have a President who's an operative for a foreign nation at our helm. We have immigrant children still held without parents. Our election was attacked by Russia and the corrupt GOP is doing everything to make sure we don't put protections in place against it happening again. 3
Not everyone can be right all the time about everything, and, if you think that's possible, then eventually you're going to be standing by yourself, "right," but alone. 2
Maybe you disagree with Mark Duplass, which is completely fair (personally I think even Ben Shapiro's mother should unfollow him). But that doesn't make Duplass' point-of-view evil. There are a lot of traitors &amp; racists in the country today. Perhaps save the outrage for them. 1
Trump negotiating with Putin to give him Ambassador @McFaul would be the same as Obama negotiating with Osama Bin Ladin to give him the American Ambassador to Afghanistan under Bush. #treason #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
@renato_mariotti @chrbit3 @daschmidt883 Agreed.
@realDonaldTrump Like you in prison? Agreed.

@nasusgirl @realDonaldTrump That's why I used it. I'm speaking in code so he doesn't know what we're talking about, like parents speaking pig Latin around their three year olds.
In other words, Trump ONCE AGAIN outright states he believes Putin over American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, which is what he said in Helsinki and then "apologized" for (but really didn't) yesterday. #traitor #treason #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/cpBNDjzN3k
@Jennnova123 @realDonaldTrump Oh I know it well and see it every day.
@realDonaldTrump Also, what kind of moron says “people at the higher ends of intelligence” when they can just say “intelligent people”?  (Answer: A moron who uses convoluted terminology in an attempt to make himself look smarter than he is.)
@realDonaldTrump Derangement is thinking there are 2 CHOICES: make it clear on an international stage you stand with Putin over America, OR go to war with a country we’ve never really gone to war with.  But we know you don’t think that. You say it to trick gullible people. And you work for Putin.
@realDonaldTrump No intelligent people think that. Also, you betrayed our country, and should be in prison.  Also, someone who tweets the word “collusion” every single day and STILL can’t spell it should never tweet about “people at the higher ends of intelligence” ever again. https://t.co/ckB6S009Zf
@davidfrum More like he’s third in command of the despotic regimes.
@RealClancyBrown But, you know, it could have been someone else too. It could have been a lot of people.
Yes. Trump misspelled a word he fucking tweets every single fucking day. https://t.co/8yThT2mAOr
This is real. He made a point not to say that those who attacked our elections should be brought to justice. Can you believe this blatantly treasonous shit? https://t.co/LqYwUpFCpx
@secupp “Lib-Buster” needs to find a new job besides busting.
@MikeGrunwald @MrJonCryer That’s been my irritation of the day as well. He was sucking up to Putin even before the campaign, and the initial US intelligence questioning whether Trump was a Putin asset was also during the campaign.
@MrJonCryer Yeah, the two choices are support a foreign dictator over the country he’s the President of or SHOOT HIM. She’s such an obvious moron.
@skaye He did do something. He just didn’t say anything publicly. Again, big mistake in my opinion, but it’s a lot different than actively being an asset for a foreign government.
@skaye 👍
@skaye Thirdly, I think Obama majorly fucked up not taking public steps when the information was 1st discovered. But inferring that’s the same crime doesn’t follow as Trump’s actions are purposely helping Russia vs Obama making a mistake. Very, very different. 2
@skaye Well, three things. There are legal definitions and plain definitions. I’m using the plain definition. Secondly, the crime Trump is committing is probably espionage, which also can come with a penalty of death. 1
@outdoor_myers @ThomboyD I know you aren’t saying that. It’s all good.
@ThomboyD @outdoor_myers Yes I know, I’m talking to Josh. Sorry for using the plural.
@outdoor_myers @ThomboyD Guys, there are legal definitions of crimes and then there are definitions of words. This is writing/talking 101.
Treason: the crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.  One who commits treason is a traitor.  It’s absolutely the correct term - Trump is a traitor/he has committed treason. https://t.co/YzLMv3bQgl
Kremlin-controlled state TV hosts declare, "Trump is ours!" &amp; joke that US lawmakers traveled to Russia "to make deals with hackers, so they can rig the midterms in favor of Trump's team." This is on RUSSIAN STATE TV. Anyone still doubt Trump's a traitor? https://t.co/JTbsT0pbu2
Countries with a larger GDP than Russia: Germany Canada Japan United Kingdom China India France Brazil Italy South Korea So why are we alienating so many of these countries in favor of such a, relatively, economic weakling? #treason
@cpickler18 Absolutely.
That wasn’t the intelligence agencies, that was God offering commentary on your bullshit. https://t.co/6lm0MnAv9J
“I accept our intelligence community’s conclusion that meddling took place,” Trump said. Then said, “Could have been other people also. There’s a lot of people out there.” Please note that the second statement completely defies the first. That is, he's still in Putin's pocket.
Yesterday, we had a President show himself to be an obvious Russian asset on the world stage, completely consistent with his every other action as President, serving Putin's desires at every turn. Today, the GOP criticize, but do nothing. WE WILL REMEMBER AND SO WILL HISTORY.
I accidentally said Jeffrey Dahmer never killed anyone because he said so, but I meant to say I see no reason why it wouldn’t be Dahmer who might have maybe killed some people, who knows.

@theyearofelan @StephenKing High point.
@VP @POTUS FUCK YOU.
@JeffFlake Thank you. But if you are truly horrified by this, as the majority of Americans are, do something about it.
His statements were clear, @newtgingrich. He’s a traitor. He chooses to support a lying dictator who attacked our nation over our entire tireless &amp; patriotic intelligence community. You know as well as I Trump should be in prison - time for you to put America before politics. https://t.co/ZblbUgk1JZ
Trumpies want us to believe anti-Trump forces are pro-war forces because they don’t have any other acceptable excuse for #TREASON. But this isn’t about peace/no peace - it’s about Trump being a Russian asset.
Here’s logic for you: the opposite of a President kowtowing to a dictator IS NOT WAR. There are obviously many diplomatic responses to a country attacking our election process besides either becoming completely subservient or armed conflict. https://t.co/YV2h3I3glT
That’s because Putin loves sending signals that he owns Trump without saying it outright. He does this at every opportunity. Unlike Trump, Putin’s a smart guy, and he knows by not answering the question it seems like he does have compromising material on him. 😉 #treason https://t.co/lLkRcCj9Jb
@Markind_0 @SyfyWire @SYFY No they have not
#AMAGA (Actually Make America Great Again)
If you’ve been supporting Trump &amp; every once in a while a voice in the back of your head says, “maybe you shouldn’t be.” Yeah, that’s God. Today, as we witness Trump’s great #treason on the world stage, would be a great day to make a change. We all make mistakes.
To think Putin only has a pee tape at this point seems unrealistic. I mean, Trump is certainly a urine-lapper (I mean, how else did he get HIS nickname, #UrineLappingDonny), but for Trump to be this submissive to Putin, there must be something more. #TreasonSummit
If you really don't think Trump is in Putin's pocket after he agrees with Putin over every US national security &amp; law enforcement agency on the world stage, you're blind. This is a betrayal to our country. Trump is a traitor &amp; should be impeached. #TreasonSummit. https://t.co/dWtWXdg49s
I've often wondered how some politicians can be so stupid &amp; corrupt as to support Trump - but seeing people like @CongJoeWilson &amp; @DanaRohrabacher fall so easily for creating a PSA advising giving guns to toddlers, you see it's consistent! So dumb! https://t.co/ZeVobwyTy3
@WhittonAl Happy Birthday!
@bigmutato It's from me.
@spragueyboy Someone has already partially gotten it.
@kevin_dlugosz @JoeMcA90 The stated intentions of these campaigns was to create unease &amp; a disruptive world environment where Putin could consolidate power. You may not believe Trump KNOWINGLY did this (lol, sure) but even his own cabinet members &amp; appointed heads of the CIA &amp; FBI agree this is the case.
@kevin_dlugosz @JoeMcA90 I can't believe I'm even responding to this - but, give me a break. Putin financed, whether independently or in tandem, both Brexit and the Trump campaigns. There is no one in the US government who disputes this except Trump himself.
Getting lots of messages about Galactus in the Collector scenes. No, he’s not there in any way. https://t.co/SNPDGMO979
Pareidolia. https://t.co/WMeiGkGErE
@JoeMcA90 It is. It's also possible that Unicorns have a secret underground society. Like the Unicorn society, there is absolutely no evidence of either of those things. There is a preponderance of evidence Putin is trying to weaken the EU and the US to consolidate power.
You know how, when someone wins an Oscar, they thank their close loved ones, and the people who really helped them make the movie, and all those to whom they're truly grateful... and then they thank the head of the studio because they know they have to? Yeah, well... https://t.co/zeZoCVMgjq

@shannonfox Honestly - I don't know. But I think rigorous self-honesty, openness, and looking for ways to best serve others are good tools that we can use to improve ourselves, no matter what our age is.
10. Sometimes my alarm goes off in the mornings and I curse the sky just like so many others across the world. That said, I AM grateful. I realize I'm fortunate in so many ways, and I count my blessings. I'm just not walking on a cloud 24/7.
9. Anyway, I don't see "following my dreams" as a big component of my career path. Nor do I think my job is a dream. It may seem that way to you, but to me writing &amp; directing is still a job. Sometimes I love it, sometimes I don't. Sometimes it's magical, sometimes a grind.
8. When it became about service to others as well as myself, I was much better at my job, and less needy and desperate. That service to others extends to HERE, where I get excited being a part of people's lives as they make themselves the best people they can be.
7. I had a spiritual awakening in my late twenties where I realized my whole life had been selfish &amp; life was about service to others as well. Strangely, magically almost, within months of redirecting the way I thought about my career &amp; my art, my success exponentially increased.
6. I of course am leaving a ton of stuff out of this story. I made a lot of 8 millimeter films as a kid, so it wasn't like filmmaking was an unknown quantity. And, more importantly - although I feel a bit vulnerable bringing this up here -
5. And, once on a movie set, I felt at home. It wasn't a dream until I was there. I was always very ambitious but, after the music stuff, I didn't have a fixed idea about what it was I needed to do or how I'd go about it. I just believed I needed to work harder than everyone else
4. That led to being admitted to grad school for writing at Columbia University in NYC, and while working and doing monologue shows in that time, was discovered by @lloydkaufman at Troma studios, who hired me to write a screenplay (he heard I vomited on stage - not really true).
3. And I realized, almost immediately, I was good at it. Unlike playing music, I wasn't forcing myself into a job that didn't quite want me. I worked my ass off - 120+ hours a week - but it was also easy, because it flowed, and I was getting a lot of positive feedback early on.
2. But I felt I was forcing myself as a musician in this world. So I went on a period of discovery where I went to college, considered being a lawyer, psychologist, professor, cartoonist, and had FUN discovering stuff. This is when I took my first creative writing class.
1. I didn't follow my dreams. I wanted to be a rock star. I played professionally in bands. I was a decent song writer and good performer, but not a great singer, and, at 22 or so, the band I was in broke up. I had offers from other bands... https://t.co/BoevQVU85u
@tencents77 Yeah, after talking about these concepts for years, which I used practically, finding ikigai was amazing as it lines up very closely with my beliefs, and the thoughts in this article. Really cool stuff.
@AxlWarpshaft That's irrelevant to this advice.
7. Although people often accuse me of being negative when I malign the saying "follow your dreams", I believe it's because that dumb platitude doesn't allow for how big, magical, and full of undiscovered wonders we, and life, actually are.
6. In a world where technology is ever-changing, &amp; whole swaths of careers are disappearing while others appear in their place, this is even more true. If I put all my stock into my teenage dream of franchising laserdisc rental stores across the country, I'd be screwed today.
5. And, as the findings conclude in the article above, following your dreams isn't just bad advice because it's narrow-minded, it's bad advice because it treats our dreams and passions as fixed objects when, in fact, dreams and passions can be developed and discovered over time.
4. An additional value to this process is learning about dreams you didn't know existed, or weren't on your radar in the first place. This, to me, is a much more wholistic and realistic way of developing ourselves as people, our careers, and striving for success.
3. Instead of just following your dreams, you find a balance of what you're good at, what you love doing &amp; how you can best service others &amp; the world - and, yes, you can serve the world by managing restaurants, or doing contracting work, or playing fiddle in an alt-country band.
2. Instead of "following your dreams", I have advised a hardcore period of discovery - for many people this is the college years - where people do research on themselves, on the world around them, and how they interact with that world.
1. Those of you who have followed me here for a while know I sometimes rail against the advice, "Follow your dreams." It's a small-minded platitude to make people feel good, but there are better ways of finding a career. Now there's research to back me up: https://t.co/CGJ2DYhZ1I

Trump &amp; the GOP have built a conspiracy theory on a couple off-hand texts from Strzok.

@RobACrawfish Hanks made millions off of those projects as well. It's a commercial niche. For the record, I think both Sacha &amp; Hanks are motivated by career AND by beliefs - Hanks, the heroism of soldiers, and Sacha, fighting hypocrisy and idiocy. But that's all still assumption.
@kml423 Well at least you show how open-minded and impartial you are by waiting for the show to air before having an opinion.
In today's explosive, two-sided America, people see something happen they don't like - Cohen makes Palin &amp; Walsh look stupid - and their brains furtively search for something to make it wrong. AHA! STOLEN VALOR! Which this so obviously is not.
NO ONE IS OUTRAGED. They, like you, are just afraid of how stupid the people they follow are going to come off. Sarah Palin isn't outraged. She's just trying to get ahead of how dumb she looks. It's time to distinguish between real-outrage &amp; outrage-because-it-helps-my-side. https://t.co/bIzy83pM6y
Palin's desperate to get ahead of her stupidity. She's jumping up &amp; down in front of the screen, waving her arms, NO! DON'T LOOK AT THAT! unaware of how much attention she's attracting (because, yes, she's that stupid &amp; it'd be wiser to shut up). Walsh just wants to be relevant. https://t.co/istYcVtMBL
@RobACrawfish Well that's an idiotic assumption unrelated to what I said. I said one's making a movie and another is making a TV show. You can't assume either of their motives (though assuming altruism on a movie Tom Hanks made 30+ million on is of course silly).
@Jim_Jordan @CNN That's called research and it's the opposite of fake news, dummy.
@RobACrawfish @SarahPalinUSA @WalshFreedom @SachaBaronCohen @tomhanks What nonsense. Banks was making a movie, and Sacha was making a TV show. Neither one of them was in it for the "valor."
So @SarahPalinUSA &amp; @WalshFreedom are accusing @SachaBaronCohen of “stolen valor” because he tricked them while dressed as a vet in his new Showtime show. I suppose next they’ll be going after @tomhanks for “Saving Private Ryan.”

@BlackFranFine Again, to me it's funny because he gave him something and got nothing in return, but I understand the sensitivity around the issue. And thanks for the compliment.
@BlackFranFine It's not about giving a handy being bad, no matter who is giving them to whom. It's about giving something for nothing. Any mention of sex is not a denigration of sex itself.
@civale10 @mang0ld @rianjohnson @zeldawilliams @chrismcquarrie That's fine, but, if you're American, and I imagine by your name you are, you know, "What were you thinking?" is generally a put down, not an inquiry.
@ATDIUSdhumire You actually think I took more time on that tweet than I took to write it???
@realDonaldTrump Giving Kim Jong-un a handy behind a potted fern is NOT an agreement to denuclearization, no matter what you read in The Art of the Deal.
@GregShugar @realDonaldTrump quadrupling, octupling, what's the word for doubling down the ten thousandth time?
A) You have "confidence" in a guy who just killed someone for giving troops too much food? B) He IS honoring the deal you signed, which had nothing about agreeing to denuclearization. For a guy who hates fake news so much, you have a lot of it pouring out of your every orifice. https://t.co/WeP9zk4WRO
@civale10 @mang0ld @rianjohnson @zeldawilliams @chrismcquarrie We understand so much we dedicated our lives to making them. You don’t start a considered inquiry to someone you don’t know with “what were you thinking?” Why would you pretend like that’s okay? This isn’t rocket science.
Stephen Miller really showed that waiter by throwing that sushi away. Anytime someone flips me off I just take twenties out of my pocket and rip them up, right in front of him, to teach him a lesson about manners.

Funny how many of Putin’s critics are murdered. And how murdering your critics like Putin and Kim Jong-un do seems to be a prerequisite for Trump’s praise. https://t.co/v7nceCu22U

What, is the locker room where Trumpies LARP? People can say any heinous thing and it’s all role play? I’ve been in a lot of locker rooms, I don’t magically become some other person when I walk through the doors. #JimJordanMustResign
@mattgaetz He admitted he knew, Sherlock.
After @Jim_Jordan (and the orange oaf) says the 7 young men who were victims of sexual abuse were LIARS when saying he was aware of abuse, he changes his story to, “Oh yeah, I knew, but they said it in a locker room” - WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID, you corrupt piece of shit.
@chrismcquarrie @dottiehudson Sitting there and typing when you’d rather be doing something else.
@mang0ld @CBrenchley @rianjohnson @WillamKelley @JSMileHigh9798 @chrismcquarrie Yeah, my original tweets weren't even about some Star Wars fans. They were specifically about any people who are cruel to creators just doing their best. But, for some weird reason, a small subsection of Star Wars fans has taken that as a personal attack.
@rianjohnson @mang0ld @WillamKelley @JSMileHigh9798 @chrismcquarrie I hear you, man.
And the same exact folks who supported Hastert are now supporting Jim Jordan (including Fox News who, as a rule, seems to support all rapists and sexual assaulters who aren’t “Hollywood elites”). https://t.co/etL1r6hQzo

@besteveitornot What he was doing was what Putin asked him to do four months ago.
Translated: Trump sucked up to, gave international credence to, and praised a genocidal dictator; he gave Kim (and Putin) what he wanted, and got nothing in return. It’s the same flawless logic Trump used going bankrupt six times. #FakeBillionaire https://t.co/lycyrR5URA

@graffiticlocks @jubail_ahmed Agreed. I don’t think IW is ruined by spoilers.
@slambrechts Oh believe me I think critics or folks spoiling movies is an asshole move. But it’s not the be all and end all.
If a movie can be ruined by spoilers, it’s not a good movie. I’m opposed to spoiling things for folks, but studies show knowing spoilers only very slightly affects the viewer’s pleasure, if at all (and sometimes increases the pleasure of a well-crafted film).

@RageM0j0 @lancegiuliano @MarvelStudios It is not my understanding that it's a done deal.
@lancegiuliano @MarvelStudios We don’t own FF.
@itsagivensblog @sinKEVitch Maybe read the whole thread before criticizing, in which that was addressed.
@GeoffThorne @Goldrushcomic @sinKEVitch Well, I understand the paradox, but it IS the movie, not really a copy, even more so in a digital world. I agree with the ugliness and the sense of ownership/entitlement on the part of some fans.
@calum_carson @PaulyWallStreet He doesn't. He's an actual bot (or, more specifically, a sock puppet who is partially managed by real folks who work for the Russian government). Check out his page - almost all retweets or trolling, spreading disinformation, and focused on only one thing). Fake as fuck.
@GeoffThorne @Goldrushcomic @sinKEVitch Well, those versions are the same, because those are synonymous ideas. You can't extract "belonging to" from "ownership." And roses aren't movies - you can't take roses home - not copies, but the roses themselves - and own them yourself.
The tweets saying "Leave Chris Brown alone" when he's arrested on a felony battery charge after being convicted of a previous felony battery are, to say the least, disheartening. But we have a President with 21 sexual assault accusers mocking "me too" so I guess it's expected.
@danactual @Gordon_nordrog @MasterTainment Good work, but not exactly correct. These coordinates have been accurately deciphered in the past.
@GeoffThorne @Goldrushcomic @sinKEVitch I don't think so. As I said in a tweet yesterday, once a movie is out there it doesn't belong to anyone. It just is what it is. The IP &amp; materials belong to Disney, the thoughts &amp; feelings surrounding it belong to individual fans.
@Goldrushcomic @sinKEVitch I never said it belonged to Disney.
@shaneroberts__ He is the acting reference for Rocket:
@realDonaldTrump You really do tweet with only incredibly stupid people in mind, huh?

@artandgrooves @ArcSparkler26 Once it's out there, I don't think it belongs to anyone. It just IS and what individuals make of it is what belongs to them. But, yes, of course the IP &amp; specific materials belong to Disney &amp; our emotions &amp; thoughts around it belong to us.
@Asking_Daz Feel free to list the members of the previous two administrations who were repeatedly caught lining their own pockets and lying about it and weren’t fired (spoiler: the answer is none).
We found out today what it takes to lose your job in the Trump administration: over a year of being corrupt &amp; continuously busted using your position to fill your own pockets &amp; lying about it.*  *Unless you’re a member of the Trump family.
@OseronPhaer @Grummz I said nothing about the motivation of people who are dissatisfied. I only talked about the motivation of fans who are being unceasingly cruel.
@ravenblack60 @Grummz Being cruel - which is what this thread was about - isn’t anyone’s therapy.
@JesseBarthalem1 @Grummz No, my comments were about attacking people personally and unceasingly because you don't like something they did artistically.
@HL_Mechken @Grummz You can’t be serious.
@Grummz Large or small, they were very specifically the only ones I addressed. I didn’t mention fans in general. I didn’t mention box office. I know hardly anyone associated with Star Wars. You seem to have a whole story in your head that has nothing to do with what I said.
@HL_Mechken @Grummz I can’t change other people’s tweets. That’s a pretty basic aspect of Twitter.
@HL_Mechken @Grummz Mark's response to my thread.

@HL_Mechken @Grummz It was my kind way of saying it doesn’t logically follow what I was saying. Perhaps I should have been more up front.
@PlasticPanic @Grummz I never mocked ASD folks. And I never boasted I knew about a serial rapist for 20 years. I knew James Toback was a serial harasser AND I wrote about it publicly. When I heard about anything having to do with rape (less than a year ago) I urged that person to tell others. She did.
@ryanmckannan Can I get a head count?
95% of fandom is awesome. And no one has to like Star Wars or Marvel or anything - love it, hate it, dislike it, whatever. My tweets from yesterday specifically address those who use their hate as a reason to be cruel, or whose self-worth relies on movies other people are making. https://t.co/P7MZ7VCcUX
@kylegriffin1 Oh my gosh.
The corruption continues running rampant with Trump, his family members, Scott Pruitt, and now Wilbur Ross, all using their positions to increase their personal profits at the expense of the country’s well being. No, this isn’t normal, or even close. https://t.co/McrBYfm8sH
@Grummz Well I didn’t paint any fan base with a broad brush stroke. I specifically pinpointed sections of a fan base that are cruel or who base their own self-worth on some property. I think and have only ever expressed that most fans - of Star Wars, Marvel, DC, whatever - are awesome.
@Grummz I have no clue what this thread has to do with a thread about me not being cool with folks being unnecessarily cruel to actors and creators. As a creator yourself I would think you’d understand that. As I said, criticism is fine and should be expected.

@MattDemers I don’t understand this tweet but it seems like you’re comparing ME, an individual filmmaker/storyteller, to a corporation, EA. My thread is about people being cruel to other people who are simply trying their best. But, again, perhaps I misunderstand.
@Jack_tevo I don’t mean don’t watch it the first time, obviously.
@ChrisJustice Some Star Wars fans treat their own films like some Marvel and DC fans treat the others’ - I’m not sure if they’re the worst, just that a certain type of angry, entitled fan sucks, no matter what his or her colors.
Star Wars (or any movie) may be important to you, but it doesn’t belong to you. If your self-esteem depends on how good you think the current Star Wars is, or your childhood is ruined because you don’t like something in a movie, GO TO THERAPY.
People responding to this post saying, “Yeah, it wasn’t the actor’s fault! It was the writer’s!” are missing the point. Critique it. Don’t like it. But spewing hate and bile at individuals just doing their best to tell a story, even if the story sucks, is lame. Don’t watch it!
@FizzgigGM That’s not the point. I don’t think the writer deserves to be attacked any more than the performer.

@realDonaldTrump Yeah, you’re just trying to get us to talk about ANYTHING other than the fact today the bipartisan Senate subcommittee has declared conclusively that Putin purposely worked to help you win the election. https://t.co/iq8Cf15mBU
@realDonaldTrump From one professional writer to another: you suck at it. Also, it’s “pore over.” Also, you’re a traitor to our country and your presidency is possibly illegitimate.
Absolutely unacceptable. The day the Senate releases confirmation Putin actively worked to support Trump in our elections, and Trump wants to meet with him ALONE, off the record? For what purpose?!How corrupt are those in our government still supporting this traitorous oaf?! https://t.co/vvdvz1jjDT
Every American needs to read this and ask themselves WHY did Putin want Trump elected? Is it because Trump has, so far, done every single thing Putin has wanted and is working not for the American people, but for the Russian government?
The bipartisan Senate Select Committee once and for all conclusively states Putin and the Russian government worked to sow disinformation and denigrate Clinton and work in support of Trump with the goal of undermining democracy. https://t.co/iq8Cf15mBU

@DEmeryTaylor @RonPaul I lost any respect for the guy after seeing him in Bruno, frankly.
Super-moronic tweet. Obama did MEET Farrakhan in 2005, but he wasn’t a “fan.” For instance, he never said all the nice things about him Trump said about actual genocidal maniac Kim Jong-un. And why is it always anonymous cowards telling me to “be a man”? Also: #whataboutism https://t.co/pxOEPG2kVN
AND - this is important - NO APOLOGY. Don’t think this wasn’t considered and dismissed by racist Cryptkeeper @ronpaul and his people - they want to placate the people offended while not alienating their racist supporters.
Yeah. You post racist images EXACTLY like 1930’s Nazi racist propaganda &amp; you “delete” it. Not fire who was responsible. Not say who was responsible. Just delete the image but keep the link to the same bullshit. Fuck off, @RonPaul. https://t.co/AgNb8XWXh8
@deadpirate @thx3188 @MichaelDunlap_ @RonPaul Exactly. He took down the original tweet and replaced it with that.

And how can anyone support a President's platform that relies on openly, obviously, and blatantly lying about the platforms of his opponents?  Anyway, I hope you're all having an okay weekend despite the madness.
I mean, really? The two choices are spending money our country doesn't have on building the fucking Berlin wall along the border or open borders? Nothing in-between? How can we even converse with people so simple-minded?
I can't tell you the amount of times I've posted something against kids being traumatized by being separated from their families, and some glazed-eyed Trumpie writes in all caps that this means I'm for "open borders", as if that's the ONLY CONCEIVABLE alternative.
The continuous, purposeful lies by Trump (and the subsequent belief of his gullible followers) that the Dems are running on a platform of "open borders" is not only stupid, but another way in which he dumbs down every complex issue into fear mongering extremes.
@carriecoon @AManHas19040901 And he's kept up a continuous, unrelenting war against the press solely so that he won't have to be held accountable - which is exactly what Hitler and Putin did. There is no other current President, Democrat or Republican, who has done anything similar.

@paddy_omalley He did. I'm quoting him. Twice this week - the last time at the South Carolina rally - he pointed out the press and called them "the enemy of the people." You can listen to or watch it yourself.
Let's not forget that Trump's most retweeted tweet ever is this one inciting violence against the press. https://t.co/mvjG3a5QiW
@paddy_omalley Great meme. Doesn't apply when a President is calling a group "the enemy of the people." Not rocket science.
@art1e @Whiskey_Wolfe Yeah, I've seen that bullshit meme and it's bullshit. https://t.co/wUmyac2WCV
And, again, the shooter didn't do anything about it until 2 DAYS AFTER Trump called the press "the enemy of the people" (twice in 1 week). Those are facts. You can piece them together however you want. But Trump's behavior, whatever the case, is repugnant &amp; he should be impeached https://t.co/sNKk2h6hyH
@RogerRogerATX @htwam_sarah And he didn't do anything about that anger until two days after the President called the press "the enemy of the people."
@art1e @Whiskey_Wolfe In all truth, most mass shooters are non-political or of unverified politics. They definitely are not "mostly liberal." Just completely false. But, whatever the case, they don't necessarily have a person in power turning a group of people into villains.
@htwam_sarah By the way, I FOUND this on the shooter's Twitter page, so I don't know why you think it's wrong.
@htwam_sarah Oh, please, by all means, provide me a link to this "proof".
The shooter was angry at the paper about the way they reported on a case he lost THREE YEARS AGO. Trump called the press "the enemy of the people," and two days later this piece-of-shit goes and shoots them. https://t.co/F1ejC1LfYm
The mass-shooter who shot the press today, three days after Trump called the press "the enemy of the people," was a Trump fan. Trump has used his position to continuously lie about and vilify the press. The blood of those people is most definitely on his hands. https://t.co/atfQIWwW14
@natedoggg07 @realDonaldTrump You don't get to show respect to people the day after they died, but call them the "enemy of the people" the day before.
@KcNekro Bullshit. What Trump said is absolutely not fucking acceptable no matter what the situation today. He needs to be held the fuck accountable.
@BobbyQ81 Never seen the movie.
@Gravemindzombie No, biased and false are two completely different words.
@daynal We will discuss then!!! :)
@Gravemindzombie Occasionally citing liberal bias is absolutely NOT the same thing as constantly saying the news is completely made up, and, no, it hasn't always been the fallback. Most Presidents dealt with facts as facts, not just claimed those facts weren't true!
@TonyMehegan Right now, yes. Because they can't win and they take away votes from the candidate you truly prefer.
Why can't we fly? Why don't rainbows come out of our eyes when we're happy? Reality is what it is and we have limitations. RIGHT NOW the only way to combat the corrupt GOP &amp; Trump is by voting for Democrats or for proven anti-Trump folks, period. https://t.co/1Fb3p2DyJR
@sweenbean307 Obviously, the guy who says the press is the enemy of the people with millions and millions of people as an audience, as opposed to the outrageous goofball who most don't take seriously who has thousands as an audience.
@Gravemindzombie Okay, please, just keep making up stuff. There were not daily attacks, or even frequent attacks, by any President upon the press in recent history.
Just imagine if Trump had said "the Jews are the enemy of the people." But he says it about the PRESS and his supporters are okay with it.
Anyone who claims to care about decorum or civility &amp; supports TRUMP, the All-Time King Ass Clown Vulgarian, is either a deceitful hypocrite, a moron, or both. But other Republican Presidents did NOT daily attack the press or have private, off-the-record sessions with Putin, ETC. https://t.co/QTCVpuMy0c
@mang0ld Absofuckinglutely.
THREE DAYS AGO Donald Trump, the President of the United States, pointed at the press during a rally &amp; called them "the enemy of the people." The blood of those reporters is on Trump's hands, far more than Milo Yiannopoulos or anyone else.
@realDonaldTrump FUCK YOU. You called the press "the enemy of the people" on stage just THREE DAYS AGO, you piece of shit. Their blood is on your hands.
@dopeypones Whatever the corrupt reptaloids calling themselves Republicans today who back Trump are, they suck.
@missfaithfriday @Notbergmann @AngerAndAgony13 @CoreyTaylorRock I largely agree. Welfare isn't the problem. But, again, honestly, not of this is the problem right now. The problem is the Nationalism of Trump.
I believe this is true. I've voted libertarian, Republican, &amp; Democrat in the past. But, for now, the Republicans have lost me due to their adherence to Trump &amp; a corruption unique to them (that is, it's NOT "both sides), so I'm voting 100% Democrat for the foreseeable future. https://t.co/m6XRVpCDxF
@AngerAndAgony13 @CoreyTaylorRock I know, friend. I know. First things first. Hopefully we'll have a future where we can actually argue politics and not the shit that's happening today. And, for the foreseeable future, I am voting Democrat all the way.
@upkody I was poor for a long time. I don't hate poor people.
@Notbergmann @AngerAndAgony13 @CoreyTaylorRock Oh, people who call themselves conservatives today are just a bunch of shit. They aren't conservative.
@AngerAndAgony13 @CoreyTaylorRock Oh what I would give for this to be the argument we're arguing today, instead of having a wannabe dictator as President.
@AngerAndAgony13 @CoreyTaylorRock For the record, many, maybe even most of the actions prescribed in this article, I agree with. But the writer definitely doesn't understand the complexities of what it means to be fiscally conservative.
@AngerAndAgony13 @CoreyTaylorRock Oh bullshit. You can’t spend money you don’t have, and you can’t spend money now that will crush future generations. That’s not anti-progressive, that’s reality. But I’d vote for a communist, or a cucumber, over Trump, any day.
Too good. “Godwin’s Law” is the longer an argument goes on the greater the chances of Hitler being brought up are. Trumpies LOVE to cite this incorrectly as saying it nullifies your argument. OBVIOUSLY, in some cases - as with Trump - the comparison is adequate and appropriate. https://t.co/XvXJphSDBU
Let’s get this straight - I am far from liberal - I’m fiscally conservative &amp; socially progressive. But being against a CORRUPT, SELF-SERVING, POSSIBLY TRAITOROUS, PURPOSEFUL LIAR OF A PRESIDENT has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative. It’s about not being a RUBE. https://t.co/XE9lJbRTIT
And it’s why - according to his ex-wife - the only books he kept next to his bed were Mein Kampf and a book of Hitler’s speeches. The idiot can’t spell “border” &amp; won’t read his morning briefs, but he’s read every word Hitler has spoken. https://t.co/A2Sf6dzPcz
@Dara989512 @MarvelStudios @Guardians Awesome
And yes, OOOO, I brought up Hitler!! Oooo! And NO that doesn’t nullify the argument when the actions are EXACTLY THE SAME! WAKE THE FUCK UP.
For the slow folks: When Trump calls out the “fake press,” it’s not because he actually believes it’s fake, but because he wants gullible  folks to believe his heinous actions they report on aren’t true - JUST LIKE Hitler did with crying “Lügenpresse” - “lying press.”
Hillary isn’t being investigated in part because she isn’t saying Russia is telling the truth and the CIA, FBI, and every major intelligence agency is lying - they ALL say Russia meddled in our elections, you corrupt, Russian-owned, traitorous douchebag. https://t.co/cvKgkXqeiL
@Sirveaux1066 @Jim_Jordan I hear you and I'm sorry for that. My tweets reach a million people a day on Twitter alone. It's not all I'm doing, but it's part of it, and I think it's important.
@VinoVertias @Jim_Jordan I give hundreds of thousands. Quit attacking people when you're supposedly on their side. THAT is how to lose.
@Sirveaux1066 @Jim_Jordan So instead you're spending YOUR time on Twitter complaining about others speaking their minds on Twitter? Dude.
@AJaydee1210 You don't understand investigations at all. People always investigate based on circumstantial evidence. That's how all investigations work, including all DOJ investigations. Maybe learn the basics before forming an opinion about such complex matters.
Some shots from #GotG Vol. 1 exactly 5 years ago today - June 28, 2013. We were just a few days into shooting the movie. You can see the enormity of the Kyle set - composed of over 100,000… https://t.co/osSHZLJz7T
@compliancedivis Yes, that by itself is enough reason to investigate.
@AJaydee1210 Every bit of evidence in both those articles is a fact. Name one thing that's been disputed.
6 So what happened on the House Floor today is a travesty, and another sign the current Republicans care more about maintaining power than they do about our country being influenced by the needs of a foreign power (and Trump's policy in the past has served the Russians greatly).
5 And we have, on record, over 80 links between Russian operatives and the Trump team, and the Trump team have been proven to have lied about these links many times. So any time a GOP member says there is no evidence, they are LYING and they are CORRUPT.
4 And, remember, what Mueller is actually investigating, isn't the nebulous term "collusion", it is, specifically, "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump."
3 And here is some other basic evidence of the Russian government working with the Trump team to influence the election - https://t.co/2bh53ymbW4
2 For instance, here are 82 contacts between the Trump team and Russian operatives, which the Trump team has been CAUGHT LYING about 15 times. https://t.co/4zg5n4XFkZ
There's currently a federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with the Russian government to influence the 2016 campaign. That's a pretty serious allegation that could affect all of us, &amp;, despite constant GOP claims otherwise, there's AMPLE evidence of this. 1

Not a surprise since we have a President whose diplomacy is purely for show and he gave Kim (and Putin) exactly what they wanted, and received NOTHING - nothing in return. Slapping the back of a murdering dictator and calling him an awesome dude does not bring World Peace. https://t.co/IZvwpzZI3v

@DaveBautista For all those people who are claiming Dave shouldn’t compare this to Nazism, he just did so in a way that’s an exact parallel. He didn’t call Trump a Nazi. He didn’t say he was causing a genocide. But on this one single point he’s using Nazi rhetoric. That’s simply accurate.
@realDonaldTrump So what you’re saying is “Fuck the constitution”? Got it.
@RedHenReviews In practice, many thousands more of children were separated from their families under Trump’s Zero-Tolerance Policy.  Not rocket science.

@AngelaKinsey @rainnwilson Ahaha
@no1valyria @homesickgeordie You can state what the laws are/were but the way those laws were interpreted and the PRACTICE of what was being done to children was very different. Those are facts.
@no1valyria @homesickgeordie Under the Clinton &amp; W &amp; Obama administrations they did everything possible to avoid separating children from their parents, because it was considered unnecessarily traumatizing. But that all stopped with Zero Tolerance where many many more thousands of families were separated.
@no1valyria @homesickgeordie No it wasn’t. They sometimes separated kids when the parent was a danger. But they avoided separating parents &amp; kids at all costs and it was not the many many thousands they are doing today under Zero Tolerance.
@STARKSQUlLL @JennLholland I have been there and had a great time!
Spoiler:  No, there is no law that requires families be separated. Trump wants you to believe this so he can pretend his Zero-Tolerance Policy isn’t 100% responsible for torturing children at the borders. https://t.co/Yhw3rKqQJu

@RickyAgyekum2 No. The Trump team knowingly received help from the Russian government in the election. That’s cause for impeachment. One can’t extrapolate from that that’s what won Trump the election.
@RickyAgyekum2 @thecolegarner @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I never said Russia won the election for Trump. Dude you need to learn how to process information more accurately.
@RickyAgyekum2 @thecolegarner @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I’m not arguing. I can’t argue with you because you’re speaking a language that doesn’t exist. You don’t understand statistics. It’d be like me trying to argue with a French person about the French language (I don’t speak French).
@shiplore Warm... hot... hotter... burning hot!!!
@RickyAgyekum2 @thecolegarner @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Sorry, I thought when you said, “This is still a predictor,” you were saying it was a predictor. Whatever the case - no, you still don’t understand how polls work or what they represent and a course in rudimentary statistics would help you with that. Again, best of luck!
@RickyAgyekum2 @thecolegarner @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews No this is not a predictor - there is no prediction of outcome, as in election polls, just a percentage of people who believe something. You need to take a basic course in statistics; it would help you a lot. Good luck.
@thecolegarner @RickyAgyekum2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Someone doesn’t understand how polls work. Hillary had a 2/3 chance of winning - that means 2/3 times someone had those numbers they’d win - but 1/3 they DIDN’T. This is 42% of Americans - over 4 out of 10 - who think Trump should be impeached. You’re welcome.

@dcpoll @MrJonCryer @AndrewKirell Trump goes from figuratively autographing to photos of dead kids to literally doing so.
@robfee @McDonalds Not cool, McDonald’s.
@the_mattastic @FoxNews Absolutely not. All journalists make mistakes. All journalists have to correct things. The thing you’re attacking is a sign of strength and integrity. Fox hides their retractions (sometimes on hidden corners of their web site) or doesn’t do them at all.

@GeoffyWilson @Falconer_Photos And, yes, I’m not a liberal. So what?
@ihghost @LiberalSlayer69 Yeah! Why are you warning us????? (3D CHESS!)
@DanBringhurst @ARFELIXT Also Fox News and their acolytes keep stressing “This is a Clinton policy” or “an Obama policy” while leaving out the fact that, practically, we’re talking about many more thousands of children being separated from their children than under those first two administrations.
@ARFELIXT BBC, New York Times, Politico, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The Hill, etc. Is this where you’re gonna tell me every major news source other than Fox News is making up stuff (and, by the way, Fox has never refuted the numbers above)?
A handful of families were separated under Obama when the parents were considered dangerous as opposed to the THOUSANDS under the Zero Tolerance policy. Get your facts straight, “Liberal Slayer,” instead of having Fox News vomit bullshit into your baby bird mouth. https://t.co/glkz1lEMQT
@genghisgalahad2 2020
@TMajician Incorrect. The law is what it is and it should probably be changed. But the only kids separated from their families under Clinton, W, and Obama were from parents considered dangerous - not the THOUSANDS under the Zero-Tolerance Policy. You’re subscribing to complete malarkey.
And the EO &amp; everything he said about caring was BULLSHIT. In other words, all those anti-Trump extremists who called Trump a monster are right on target. He’s the worst President in recent history by a long shot. At least Nixon wasn’t a complete fucking moron (nor a traitor). 5
Anyway - it then got out that Trump was going to start wrenching kids from their moms and dads again one “the fury died down,” AND that he has no plans to bring the 2300 families already separated back together again. Because he’s Melania’s jacket come to life. 4
(By the way, that’s going great so far, Il Douche, since the same amount of people now want you impeached as wanted Nixon impeached AFTER Watergate). 3
So, after repeatedly saying he didn’t have the power to do so, he signed a fairly meaningless EO to appease them, because, as well as being a cruel man, he’s a weak one who wants to be loved by the public. 2
Trump really wasn’t that indecisive about immigration policy. He knew he didn’t care about kids being separated from their parents - not as much as he cared about “looking tough.” He was simply stunned Americans reacted as strongly as they did. 1 https://t.co/GUmUwZOdLb

@marcorubio @FLOTUS Marco. Seriously. She wore a jacket with the words “I don’t care” on the back to meet about the kids. It was either outrageously stupid or outrageously cruel, or some mix of both. Calling criticizing THAT Trump Derangement Syndrome is itself deranged.

@GeoffThorne @TreyStokes I don’t think you can underestimate the number of people afraid to say something to people in power - especially the suckup losers in this administration. There is very little upside in choosing that jacket and Melania IS dumb. So I’m sticking with 58% chance of just dumb.

@writerpenn2012 @realDonaldTrump Well that doesn’t make sense.
@lakelasvegas775 @AlishaGrauso It’s an observation, not a tactic.
@realDonaldTrump Lol. There’s no greater sign Melania doesn’t care about the plight of children separated from their families than her not checking to see if she’s wearing her “I don’t really care” jacket on the way to meet about them. You, and she, are dumb as rocks. That’s a putdown to rocks.
There is no greater proof that you don’t really care about the suffering of children being separated from their families than not checking to see if you’re wearing your “I don’t really care” jacket when going to meet about them.
Between misspelling “separation” on the Executive Order (for real!) &amp; Melania wearing an “I Don’t Really Care” jacket to the US-Mexico border (I’m not kidding!), the Trumps are taking dumb to a whole new level. How does anyone think these folks are mentally capable of leading?

@jtskaggs08 @thecolegarner @gracegidman There were a handful of families separated when the parent was considered a danger during O’s term, not THOUSANDS separated - every family, basically - including those legally seeking asylum, since Trump implementer Zero Tolerance. That’s a weird definition of “selective”!
@Diction @scottEweinberg For me, it’s exactly the same amount of stress with or without a large budget.
@rcosgrove No one made me feel guilty. And I wasn’t guilty. I just realized how trivial my complaints are and how horrifyingly sad what’s happening is. My complaints really are nothing compared to what is happening to those kids. It’s a realization, not a self-judgment.
@kylegriffin1 Shocker.
@gracegidman Reading a Homeland Security website for the truth is like reading Harvey Weinstein’s blog for the truth after he was accused of raping multiple women. I mean, come on, you can’t be serious.
@gracegidman The Wall Street Journal is a conservative publication. The BBC is neither left not right - it’s not American. The Hill is generally moderate. All of those publications retract mistakes they made - they are generally factual.
@gracegidman But all credible journalists are reporting things the same - including international journalists. As far as the "policy" stuff goes, you can check out this for some basics - https://t.co/zAiQRfD8pq
@gracegidman BBC, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, The Hill, Politico, Washington Post - every legitimate news source except the White House propaganda arm of Fox News (although I know what they're saying as well - they're distorting the situation to fool folks like you).
@gracegidman Before Trump, children were only separated from their parents when they were considered a danger. Because they thought it was cruel. Now it's practice for all. That's why there were only a handful of children in custody vs. the thousands in custody now.
@gracegidman The laws are not new, but it is a new policy - it's a result of the Zero-Tolerance policy implemented by Trump. You can play politics with what the word "policy" means, but as it's a result of the Zero-Tolerance policy, that is the best word for it.
I know so many of you are with me on this issue. Normally I like to pepper my twitter page with jokes &amp; photos &amp; facts from my movies in-between protesting the corruption currently infecting our White House. But right now I just can't get this shit out of my head. Love to you all
I was just about to complain about how little sleep I got last night and remembered how many three year olds are alone and crying and completely confused, after being taken by the U.S. government from their moms and dads.
@SteveSchmidtSES ❤️
@TuckerCarlson Well, if anyone knows what a political tactics is, it’s a multimillionaire many times over who constantly uses the term “elitist.”
And let me point out that the same geniuses who support locking up parents and their children without any sort of trial are the first to shout “Innocent until proven guilty!” when it’s pointed out 21 PEOPLE have accused Donald Trump of sexual assault.
Not only are they separating parents from their kids, emotionally scarring children forever before effectively imprisoning them, the Trump administration is so fucking bad at their jobs, they can’t even keep track of who belongs to who. https://t.co/vpUMiopP2y

@CoronaBroker @Bitwtay @DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump Zero-Tolerance policy is a new policy. That is when they started regularly separating families at the border. Widen what you consider as news - those are facts, and you've been misled.
@crumpyss No. You misunderstand. The point is these are people who were around gassing, extermination, etc, but the thing that hurt them the MOST is the separation. The point is that's how psychologically serious separating a child from a parent is.
@justadadintexas @realDonaldTrump I'm gonna say it again, so you all have a chance. The law does date to then. How the law is implemented is different - children were not regularly separated from their parents until the Zero-Tolerance policy of Trump. It is very simple.
"Today I heard about a ten year old girl with Down syndrome that was taken from her mother and put into a cage." "Womp womp" - Corey Lewandowski, @CLewandowski_  This is who Trump has sticking up for him, and how. https://t.co/nRfL8g2n3U
@IanFortey It wouldn’t. But I also think it’s important to stress the cause of this problem is purely Trump.
Here are some facts on whether or not the horrors of separating children from their parents were "the same" under Obama or W (spoiler: they weren't, at all): https://t.co/zAiQRfD8pq
@WordsWithDrew @damccasl A) 100%of dems have called on it to stop. So it is political. B) This is current: https://t.co/UPabWepfIs C) In regards to your other question, a handful wasn't fine, but understandable, as it was only when a parent was dangerous to the child or others they were separated.
@unhootchie Yes, that is also true.
@WagsPetCare @EveningStanners It's not always a lie as a lot of people who buy it believe it's true - I believe the person here believed it. So it's not a lie. If you want to be fair about language, be fair about language. And maybe aim your anger at someone who deserves it.
@Philrato True. But I think it's important people understand this is a part of the Trump Administration policy and how they deal with immigration.
@Morkid_883 It seems it was usually done when kids weren't safe or if a parent was a present danger that needed to be dealt with.
@WordsWithDrew I'm calling on Trump, along with 68% of the US Population, to make ONE PHONE CALL to stop the situation. It's not a law, it's a policy, a way of dealing with the laws.
Former administrations attempted to avoid separating families at all costs, because it was inhumane. So the situation is NOT old. It's brand new. And it is the direct result of Trump's marching orders. Just because some of the laws are the same doesn't mean the results have been.
Apparently, this is the right's talking point: It's been happening forever! But what was a relatively rare thing under Bush &amp; Obama became 2000 kids being taken from their parents between April and May.
More importantly: Why are you so many of you saying this HAS been going on? It has not. The ways of implementing laws has changed drastically. The Zero-Tolerance policy means it has gone from a handful of children to many THOUSANDS of children being separated from their parents. https://t.co/IEIftxlJ5M
I keep glancing over at #NationalMartiniDay under trends and thinking it says #NationalMartianDay, and becoming repeatedly disappointed.
@doctor__general The law is years old. The way of implementing it, as I referred to above, is not. That's brand new, and specifically imposed by the Trump administration. That's why there were only a handful of children in custody and now there are thousands.
They went through the Holocaust, and yet what still makes them weep is the moment they were taken from their parents. Let that sink in for a moment. And realize that's what Trump's new way of enforcing laws has now given to thousands of children - with no signs of stopping. https://t.co/c20uIHrHrp
@FATHASUN @MarveIFacts It will be.
@briansafrit I don't think that. I know it. It's not the law. It's the new way of implementing the law, as enacted by Trump, changing it from a handful of kids separated from their families to THOUSANDS. Those are facts.
@TheRealHags @TheRealSeanCrib @Bitwtay @DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump No of course not. This issue is solely about the way, under Trump’s new orders, children are being separated from their parents - nothing else.
Trump needed to hide his erection after thinking of all the pain those children separated from their parents were experiencing. https://t.co/1yYrbWEsWK
@MrDarkDC It's exactly how he worded it. He said he was leaving "sale or no sale" - i.e. he's no longer an asset.
@MrDarkDC @SteveLevitan @FoxNews Yeah, he's saying that because this now hurts Fox currently because of the sale. He's leaving, so they can't use him as an asset. I don't currently work at Fox, so I can't be used as an asset. Maybe sometimes ASK for clarification before calling bullshit on something.
@MrDarkDC @SteveLevitan @FoxNews There's no reason to think the sale is going through. If it does, of course not. It will be a separate financial entity. And bullshit.
Introducing @djimonhounsou to my friend Timon… https://t.co/zW4JAMzIEy
@William23219045 Good luck!!
Thank you, @SteveLevitan. I’d hope more people on the creative side of things who are financially able to do this would follow suit. As a content creator I’ve done work for Fox in the past, but will no longer until @FoxNews becomes a source of actual news, conservative or not. https://t.co/2C0qNQ60op
@scottderrickson He would if he thought it would help HIM in some way.
@GlennPence1 @realDonaldTrump Well, if you did your research you'd know it's not the laws that's causing this. It's the Zero-Tolerance Policy enacted by Trump (the WAY the laws are implemented) - that's the reason it went from a handful of children in custody to many thousands over a period of months.
@JerseyFinFan @RealRonHoward How do you not hear this as children being traumatized? https://t.co/UPabWepfIs
@ethan_brausen @realDonaldTrump No. It has to do with how we as people go about securing that border. We can do so humanely as possible or not. Be clear: Trump is saying it IS possible to stop detaining children how we are now, and he'll stop it, but only if we pay for his wall. That's called taking hostages.
@ethan_brausen @realDonaldTrump I'm just pointing out the illogic of telling someone to stop talking who you're following. It's really, really, really weird. I'm also astounded folks think this has something to do with controlling borders or containing immigrants - it's about the treatment of children.
Important to remember "Build the Wall" was a concept tested out by Cambridge Analytica to see if it would help Trump win the election - they found people liked it, so he used it. There's no research to show it will be of any real help with immigration issues. It's a catch phrase. https://t.co/cexzExtZbi
@Rschooley This poor woman was never the same again after this dude attacked her.
@ethan_brausen @realDonaldTrump Dude, you need to take a hard, hard look at your life. You follow me. I don't follow you back. And you keep posting "stop talking" under my posts? That's some weird issues you have to deal with.
@Fit4A_Spidey @realDonaldTrump The policy was not the same. UGH. https://t.co/zAiQRfD8pq

@pflhome @realDonaldTrump I'm going to take a wild guess and say you only watch Fox News. That's simply not true. https://t.co/zAiQRfD8pq
@realDonaldTrump 'Unbelievably great taxpayer expense'-- like your golf trips (more days off than any president ever)? It's not the Dems fault you instituted new policy that results in children being tortured. You failed here, hard. You need to figure out another way.
@realDonaldTrump #CHANGETHELAWS that YOU implemented???? So, in other words, you're holding children for ransom until you get the wall you want?
@realDonaldTrump Great timing. Is this gonna be like a celebration of you torturing kids?
@RachoftheGalaxy @prattprattpratt Oh my God that sucks.
@thashadowfigure Possible. But not with the current group.
@TheRealHags @TheRealSeanCrib @Bitwtay @DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump Neither of those are the same thing at all!!!!!!! Holy shit. I'm actually sitting here just completely stunned that you think that's what's happening here.
@NickyVeilVP @TheRealSeanCrib @Bitwtay @DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump Yeah, I do. It's always obvious when someone, like you, has a single news source. https://t.co/zAiQRfD8pq
@NeedAPriest Obama didn't do it. That's what idiots who have a single news source believe. And it's important to know this is the result of a new policy - one implemented by Trump - that he is then trying to use as his ransom note to get what he wants.
@realJSSTweets Trump says the detaining of children is easily changeable if we build him his wall. So how does that ransom note fit into your worldview, exactly? He's using this for his own needs.
@JMorriss96 nope
They aren’t missing a conductor. His name is Donald Trump, a child-abusing wad of orange, infected phlegm come to life, and he could stop this with a phone call. But refuses until the American people give him money they don’t have to build a wall. https://t.co/fd1BRbwzWp
Yes, once again, the Trump administration isn’t saying this can’t be stopped. They’re saying they can easily stop it IF YOU GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT. https://t.co/zoQzCKgxgN
@IanBoothby Shocking but true
@TheRealSeanCrib @Bitwtay @DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump He’s lecturing Dave on being educated yet doesn’t seem to know how to use Google. This is our world today.
Those are similar to the things Monsignor Obman, the head of my grade school and parish church growing up gave us. Simultaneously, he fucked us. https://t.co/J6dElDHI8q
@ava Technically, anything Trump says is something a white nationalist says after he says it.
@Bitwtay @DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump No. That is an absolute falsehood (I’m gonna guess you don’t know that so won’t call it a lie). It’s 100% a new policy imposed by Trump that could be stopped with a phone call from him.
@DaveBautista @realDonaldTrump ❤️
@seangunn He’s too stupid to do better dude. Be nice.
And let’s be clear: Trump isn’t saying that taking these children is a necessary evil. He’s saying it CAN be stopped IF he gets his wall. He’s using them as hostages to get what he wants, what he promised his supporters and failed to do.
Every American should listen to this and retweet it. This is happening right now in our country as children are ripped from their mommies and daddies. It’s a new Trump policy &amp; anything you hear otherwise is a lie. He can stop it with a phone call. https://t.co/n0kI94FBQi
@Robbin_Young @Twitter @TwitterSupport @jack @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP The gestapo would have come to get your Jewish neighbors and you’d complain about the language of your neighbors calling them dicks. You should be ashamed of yourself.

@snapperracing @goingglocal "They say less people have the flu this season but that's not true, because I have the flu!" See why anecdotal evidence doesn't necessarily mean much?
Trump's creation of a Space Force = Trump seeing that 68% of Americans are against HIS change in immigration policy, and, saying, "Uh, hey, um, uh, hey - look over here - spacemen!!"
@AlanDersh @foxandfriends Because people who are considered a flight risk or a danger to others (or if they're suspected of interfering in their trials) are often jailed. Why is it now when it's Manafort that you're suddenly protesting this?
@redsentai Yes. That's why he's in the main credits.
@powyeah140 @antoniopedreir4 @atensnut Here's how incredibly ill-informed you are, and just willing to say whatever suits your needs without any check with reality whatsoever.

@brandon_kman No. We want actual agreed upon terms of denuclearization. There were none. It was the same (for us) as signing nothing. But it was good for them.
@Noeliaa5SOS It will be after.
@brandon_kman No. He gave them what they wanted (and what Putin asked for months ago), gave a dictator respect and prominence, and got less than nothing. It’s a step backwards.
@Milkomchan @Guardians @RookerOnline @FelloWyatt @prattprattpratt Love it.
@ethanhunter @brandon_kman Good point.
@YannyLaurel2018 Oh yeah a real wonderland. https://t.co/3yhpW5vsVn
@brandon_kman He didn’t sign denuclearization papers. You’ve been had. He gave NK what they wanted in exchange for papers they both signed that said they would both “work towards denuclearization” which means- you guessed it- NOTHING. Signing papers that said ponies are cute would be the same.

@f1xxxar @thephatgeek @Lukesterami Again, that’s merely one aspect of a dictatorial regime. FDR was incredibly wrong about those things. But it didn’t go along with the dictatorial self aggrandizing, ignoring of the law, &amp; attempt to discredit the media (along with other things) Trump has in common with dictators
@Died_Stoned @thephatgeek @Lukesterami Yeah it happened under Obama. It didn’t happen purposefully, often, or as a matter of course and as something specifically implemented by the President. And it’s just blind to say otherwise at this point.
@bobbycolada73 @thephatgeek @Lukesterami A terrible thing that FDR did. But it’s ONE thing similar to Trump, not MANY.

@f1xxxar Yeah, you’re flat wrong about that. No candidate in recent history has been actively sold as “no worse than the other guy”. But thanks for the condescension. Muted.
@MrTedLouis @RobACrawfish I’ve voted libertarian before. I’ve voted Republican before. Today, Republicans are much, much worse, period. Being a libertarian has nothing to do with it.
@molmar54 @Pay2PlayTV As I said, this is something the Trump team sells and something investigated by Cambridge Analytica. They found out people would believe this so they sold Trump on it.
@MichaelRCaputo @CheriJacobus Insult tip: almost no one without children takes it as an insult they don’t have children.
When discussing today’s Republicans &amp; Democrats, no statement‘s a bigger giveaway of being duped while attempting to project objectivity &amp; intellectualism than “both sides are equally bad.” That’s a concept the Trump team actively sells so they can keep getting away with horrors.
@master_anagh ☝🏼troll muted
@P_flake They’re hand picked for the purpose of sucking up to Trump.
@thephatgeek @Lukesterami Not only that it’s a batshit crazy and ignorant statement. FDR made a lot of mistakes but it’s not the same thing. That’s Trump Team propaganda - “We’re no worse than the other guy!” - when indeed they are much much worse than the other guy. FDR did not fan the flames of selfhood

Imagine if Idi Amin or Pol Pot or Hitler or Stalin became President of the US today. And they wanted to push people, day by day, into a more dictatorial regime, within the limits of what the US population &amp; residing government would put up with on a day-to-day basis. That’s Trump

@delaneytarr 👍👍👍
@Mauldin4GA @foxandfriends @AlanDersh It’s pretty easy: if they’re a flight risk or potential danger to society (or try to purposefully screw with the case itself, as was the situation with Manafort [along with being a flight risk]), the only logical thing is to have them await trial. If not, free until trial.

@John200MA @grizzlyjoan @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump There is no doubt the Trump team did a good job of targeting voters that would help him to win the election, without any concern for the majority of Americans. You are absolutely right. They did that well.
@DoodDogs @grizzlyjoan @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump It’s the voters.
@foxandfriends @AlanDersh Dersh has lost his mind. So, like, when we capture a terrorist or a mass shooter we should just put them out on the streets until trial? So forget the concept of bail. Is he senile or now just assuming everyone has a wombat’s IQ, knowing a certain segment will believe anything?

@lilkc2 Some of the time I did. It was fun seeing a big movie being made close up for the first time.
@Bimbam76 @AnnikaKoi @JohnCMcGinley That said, I also could have said exercise or therapy or reading books - other things that improve our functioning. I just didn’t have the room for all that stuff in one tweet.
@Bimbam76 @AnnikaKoi @JohnCMcGinley I think anything that helps people become more self-realized helps to better society. I understand why you have a problem with prayer (I don’t - I think it’s a general good). But the research is there for meditation - it DOES improve our functioning.
@JoshCrewsReally Hugely. Thank you.
@Bimbam76 @AnnikaKoi @JohnCMcGinley She didn’t explain what it means to be human. She said she used meditation as a human being. Those are not the same thing. You seem to read a lot into things that aren’t necessarily there. Maybe you’re just having an off-moment.
@Bimbam76 @JohnCMcGinley And, again, I didn’t posit it as a necessary part of anything. It’s one way of many to become a more effective person. If thinking something is beneficial is evangelism then yes I guess I’m an evangelist.
@Bimbam76 @JohnCMcGinley The point of mindful meditation is just to be. One might extrapolate from that it’s to know yourself more fully, discover where your choices and yearnings come from. I bring an atheist into it because he’s an atheist who is one of the most well-known practitioners.
@Bimbam76 @AnnikaKoi @JohnCMcGinley A) My original post never said anything about anything being “necessary,” nor do I think those things are necessary. It was a list of things I think can help, that’s all. B) Not a single person in this thread has been condescending besides you saying Americans are “deeply weird.”
@Bimbam76 @JohnCMcGinley Mindful meditation is not spirtitual - Sam Harris (famous atheist) is a practitioner.
@supermod_l Haha it wasn’t the @RiverfrontTimes. They gave us good reviews!! 🙏

2. We FILLED a whole van with them. And that night we had a big show so we gave them out to the audience members &amp; had them all tear them up. It was kind of uncool but also awesome as we played &amp; all that paper was flying in the stage lights. (I was an angry young person).
1. Yes I remember it well. It was a negative review for a band I played in, in a local, free paper. So the band &amp; some fans went around the city in a van to all the local, hipster spots that carried the paper &amp; we stole (or took - I mean, it was free 😬) ALL of them. https://t.co/4ywGdlEoI6

Lead your life with compassion. Pray or meditate or both. See whatever your occupation is as a form of service. Let go of what is not within your power.

I've always thought a movie about my glamorous life, sitting at the computer in my boxers tapping away at keys all day, every day, would make a fantastic film. https://t.co/1URY8XPUiX
Today I do my best to avoid having my self-worth rely on either good reviews OR box office. I want BOTH of course! They're nice to have. But at the end of the day I only have control over what's right in front of me - the actual filmmaking. That's my only business,
That caused a whole different kind of turmoil - so happy my work was being appreciated, but so bummed out it didn't make a profit for the people who invested. And because I directed AND wrote it, I took everything more personally.
Strangely, I had the REVERSE situation 4 years later with my directorial debut Slither - it was the best reviewed American horror film in 10 years on RT, but it only made a few million bucks opening weekend.
This was my first screenplay gig. The reviews were not great - that wasn't easy But I got the call on Saturday at 5 am from Lorenzo DiBonaventura that the movie had made $18 million Friday - a record at the time.

@bigbillyb Every POTUS since FDR has increased executive privilege &amp; this is a huge problem. BUT IT IS NOT ONE SIDE OF THE FUCKING COIN. If Trump is in Putin's pocket, this is not an aspect of out of control government, it's a traitorous coup. THESE THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL OR EVEN CLOSE.
@JoeWatchesTV You're welcome, Joe (and yes I look forward to the day I can only tweet about my movies).
@Besokhujan He might be worse. He deliberately starved 2 to 3 million of his own people in a play for power. He's executed and put in prison hundreds of thousands more. And there is evidence he fucks children in his "pleasure squad."
@Kara_Jane_Adams And Chamberlain, who fucked up royally, didn't even know the extent of Hitler's atrocities at the time. Trump does know about Kim's.
@dhumire Of course not. You think that would have stopped Hitler's plans for world domination and not bolstered them?  Hitler wasn't even attacking us in WWII.
@Kyle_Beckley The pee tape hasn't been proven true - and actually isn't a particularly important part of the dossier. BUT Trump team officials have dismissed and denied numerous aspects of the dossier and afterwards been proven to have LIED. This is questionable af.
@Kyle_Beckley I have no clue what your point is. I said if the Dossier is true, and nothing has been disproven, we have a sitting President who is the pawn of Russia. If this is 1% possible we should be going fucking nuts.
The least I can do is be outspoken on Twitter. The least I can do is share my money and my time and my effort with those political forces fighting this attempted coup.  IF THAT FUCKING RACCOON CAN SCALE THAT BUILDING AND LIVE WE CAN DO THIS.  Remain vigilant. Love. Fight.
If people wonder why I am so politically outspoken on Twitter, and post as much about Trump as I do about movies I make, this is why.  Our forefathers died so our country would be free. And now we have been invaded and successfully occupied at the very highest position.
@Kyle_Beckley Dozens of the claims in the dossier have been corroborated &amp; re-corroborated. That's the point of the tweet. And Steele never admitted it was less than reliable. He said it was 70-90% accurate, which is typical for intelligence documents of this type. If that doesn't worry you...
Reminder: Not a single claim of note in the Steele Dossier has been disproven. Not. A. Single. Claim. As outrageous and outlandish as it seems, this means we have a sitting President who is not in service to the American People, but to a foreign government. https://t.co/c2VT3Y0b8T

@CeIndeed @MrJonCryer Yes it seems that way.
@MasterTainment Fucking monster.
*And Kim also executes Christians (sometimes just for possessing a Bible) &amp; puts the children of people who broke the law in labor camps. Just little things like that!

@MikeRathbone86 Not really the same. You appear desperate for an analogous event, even though I never said the behavior was restricted to the Trumps. I don't really understand it.
@MikeRathbone86 It's Whataboutism because you're reaching back over 50 years to find some other example of a President appointing family members to high level positions, and it's not even a President I'm particularly fond of.
@MikeRathbone86 Whataboutism at its most ludicrous.

@SoniaPoole14 @realDonaldTrump Not so baseless - said in a court under oath and corroborated by two friends at the time.
@BelloBeingBello @zach_viana @realDonaldTrump Your statement was factually incorrect, and it tells a good deal of the story.
@king_of_bob @jacobsammartin There’s a new exciting thing called Google. https://t.co/zrpk7JNDao
@BlackLiamNeeson It literally is not. Forbes isn’t exactly a bastion of liberal sentiment. https://t.co/zrpk7JNDao
@BelloBeingBello @zach_viana This is called changing the subject, which is just lame. Trump posted about low job growth. I posted why this was factually not true. You posted cherry picked facts that were irrelevant. Unless you’re a masochist, just admit it, or ignore it, and move on.
This is what’s called cherry-picking stats, and shows how easily people can be swayed by misleading stats. Goods-producing industries are only a portion of jobs in the US. Trump’s job growth overall is still the lowest it’s been in six years. https://t.co/Stj0Uzh4Gc
@zach_viana @BelloBeingBello I don’t even think he knows he’s cherry-picking stats!! It’s like me saying my neighbor lost his job, so there’s been a 50% job loss* since Trump became President.  *In that guy’s home.
@realDonaldTrump This is a fact: You were accused of raping a 13-year-old girl. Is it true? Probably not. But that’s another thing someone has been “accused” of. So maybe think twice about tweeting baseless accusations. https://t.co/0lv7wPCE8W

@_pickandroll_ I never said anyone does or doesn't get a pass. I said Kanye shouldn't be used as a mental health role model, or representative of people with mental health issues. He's an incredibly talented musician.
I would like to do this with my dog. https://t.co/l5K67BwfRw
@Cosmopolitan 😐
@TimothyDowling Role Models is a classic.
@ijustine We were just talking about this two seconds ago.
@fergi2479 @htwam_sarah No, but, I think as I said, there were two friends who corroborated Ivana's story from the time. This combined with 21 other women who have accused Trump of sexual improprieties is definitely a concern.
@_pickandroll_ You're very ill-informed. Robert went to PRISON for his offenses, did time, and then has spent years sober and taking care of himself and becoming a better person. He's talked about his difficult struggles many, many times, and has dealt with his issues, unlike Kanye.
@emhough871 We've only seen Peter with two women, for the record.
@RobertAngelo @Cinematic_Life Not real.
@fergi2479 @htwam_sarah Oh sorry I thought I put the pic in this thread. Here you go. https://t.co/FA0MshWPPq
@fergi2479 @htwam_sarah This is from the New Yorker. But it's what Ivana testified to (along with saying she was violently raped.) After she was awarded a settlement, she changed her story and said it was "mental rape". Pulling out the hair, however, doesn't seem to be mental.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The New York Times reported on this “exclusive” letter hours before you guys. Where’s the retraction?
@fergi2479 @htwam_sarah This is a person whose previous wife accused him, under oath &amp; corroborated by friends at the time, of tearing her hair out by the roots so she would know what it felt like to have scalp surgery like he had. I don't think it's ludicrous to think that person is capable of murder.
@baconsizzler84 I'm being honest. I honestly wonder about what's going on. Melania's tweets certainly don't seem to be written by her, which is strange. I don't know how that's sinking to someone else's level, but I'm glad you love the movies!
@suarez2200 @FirstOfRose Slavery of black people went on for much longer than 400 years, friend. The Atlantic slave trade, in particular, lasted around 400 years from the 15th through the 19th centuries.
@baconsizzler84 Maybe. But maybe the line between a guy who would tear his wife’s hair out at the roots so she would feel the pain he felt from scalp surgery &amp; a guy who lost his temper and killed his wife is thin, so it seems reasonable to question it. https://t.co/Dz6csrTkyj
@htwam_sarah Well, that's a very big part of the country questioning what's happening, which is definitely connected to morale and leadership.  That said, I'm always curious as to why people follow people on Twitter just to be rude to them. Any ideas?
@HumanityPlague A lot of people are SAYING...
It’s unlikely Trump murdered Melania in a fit of rage and the people around him are helping to cover it up while they figure out what to do next. But the fact I used the word “unlikely” instead of “impossible” or “ludicrous” kinda shows you the state of our leadership today.
@suarez2200 @FirstOfRose And, yes, for the record, there are actual physical slaves in the world today who are chained, beaten, and raped.
@suarez2200 @FirstOfRose I'm not confused. Kanye clearly said the 400 years blacks were physical slaves was a "choice" and blamed their physical imprisonment on "mental imprisonment". He then babbled about other stuff, but please don't rationalize his words to suit your needs or beliefs.
@Rodrgms No.
A Guardians film takes about five months to shoot. This one is a bit more complex, but it should be a similar amount of time. https://t.co/7qSZQ3RD0Q
@cdshepard3 @The_Iceman2288 That would be pure Trump: adopt a losing playbook.
Essentially, Trump’s lawyers are arguing that the United States does not have a President, it has a King. https://t.co/WJJ0sSFWS8
@FirstOfRose @suarez2200 This dumb meme exemplifies why Kanye's words were dumb. It implies black people who were enslaved were tied to plastic chairs and could be free if only they "opened their minds." They were locked up and beaten and whipped and raped if they tried to escape.
@NerdGirlJen You’re welcome

@Dianthrax @scottEweinberg @AlishaGrauso @Gloriousroyalty I didn’t say a single one of those things or even anything close.
@twinks4yonce @Keda_92 Well no one said there were no gay people in the Guardians movies.
@Keda_92 In my two Guardians films, there has only ever been one sexual relationship, and, yes, that's between a man and a woman. That doesn't mean I wouldn't have one between two men or two women. If you judge that and me supporting #PrideMonth as hypocrisy, okay then. I don't see it.

@scottEweinberg @AlishaGrauso @Gloriousroyalty Like I said, it's a pretty rare occurrence to feel it. But I do on occasion. Every single move he makes seems to be born from such crippling insecurity and a need to LOOK BIG which, as most know, is the result of FEELING SMALL.
@scottEweinberg @AlishaGrauso @Gloriousroyalty Compassion for Trump doesn't dictate my choices. I make objective choices on what I think is best for me, the people I love, and the world as a whole.
@scottEweinberg @AlishaGrauso @Gloriousroyalty I do everything I can every day to mitigate Trump's damage. That's irrelevant to my compassion for someone - other than, with compassion, you can understand someone better and deal with them more effectively.
@scottEweinberg @AlishaGrauso @Gloriousroyalty I don't know what this statement has to do with anything I've said. I feel compassion for lots of people I think should be imprisoned for life.
@AlishaGrauso @Gloriousroyalty @scottEweinberg That’s simply not true. Sociopaths often have a lot of inner turmoil - it’s just what makes them upset has nothing to do with empathy for others. Narcissists have an even more hellish existence.
@scottEweinberg Everyone hurts others, to varying degrees.
@astronglady I get it, completely. And I’m usually right there with you, especially Trump, where the consequences are ENORMOUS. But don’t you think they are both completely miserable people? So their amoral behaviors aren’t really helping them.
@vijtable I’m not sure it’s even “judging” exactly. But it is asking, how do we deal with the consequences of this behavior and prevent it from happening again?
@scottEweinberg I definitely mean compassion. I can’t say for sure what those people are feeling. But it seems they all have incredibly turbulent and painful inner lives. I feel sad for people going through that kind of suffering.
@suarez2200 He specifically said 400 years of slavery “sounds like a choice.” You can interpret that however you want, and perhaps he meant something different than how I put it. But that’s how I and most people saw it.
Reason, ethical medical practitioners, and faith are helpful tools for those dealing with mental health disorders. It's a difficult thing to ask for help. But if you're in need, please do. There are many better role models out there. (3/3)
Millions of people around the world deal with mental health challenges every day without declaring that black people were responsible for their own enslavement or that Hillary Clinton runs a pedophilia sex cult out of the basement of a pizza restaurant. (2/3)

@NickSchiltz @MProkopf I don't spew venom at those who challenge my thinking. I welcome thoughtful discussion. If someone is an asshole, however, it might be a different story.
@Torgo3K @realDonaldTrump Well, if my memory serves me correct he told the Russians, and I'm paraphrasing, that firing "nut job" Comey eased pressure on the Russian investigation. Not exactly the same, but just as damning (as was giving them top secret info in the same meeting).
@AnnikaKoi @ttiago_castro Yes I have!
@AP New tactic: just pardon a bunch of folks for arbitrary reasons so when he pardons his son, his daughter, his son-in-law, his campaign manager, and his lawyer, he can say, “What? This isn’t self-interest! I’m just a whimsical guy who pardons a bunch of randos!”
@realDonaldTrump I can’t believe they keep pushing the narrative that you fired Comey because of Russia, simply because you clearly said so in a TV interview. Next thing you know the corrupt media is going to start pushing the narrative that you want to build a wall!!! #FakeNews

@Diegooaal @shannonpurser @RBTOTE @zemariwarrior @carter40868458 @TheMacLyons @PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Yes. We talk about it informally all the time.
@shannonpurser @RBTOTE @zemariwarrior @carter40868458 @TheMacLyons @PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan I ask myself, Would I believe this is a real person? Is it authentic? Can they bring truth and honesty and humor to the material? And will they be professional and good to work with?
@RBTOTE @zemariwarrior @carter40868458 @TheMacLyons @PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Yes many times.
@zemariwarrior @carter40868458 @TheMacLyons @PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Is Black Hammer indie? That’s my favorite series out there right now.
@carter40868458 @TheMacLyons @PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Yes. My favorite of all time is Knights of the Old Republic.
@TheMacLyons @PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Yes. I had an actor I really looked up to as a kid butt in front of me in line once and we almost got into a fistfight over it.
@PerturbedPigeon @STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Rocket is the closest to my heart. So he’s may favorite in a way. But of course I also love Groot. I think I care about them the most because I work with them much more intimately over a longer period of time.
@STARKSQUlLL @AayuushM @AshCrossan Whoever the writer decides would win. Okay next question respond here (last reminder).
@AayuushM @AshCrossan I’ve been given the opportunity. But who knows. Maybe?
@AshCrossan You or Ryan Coogler. Okay now next question respond to this one.
Let me try something out. Being driven home and will answer questions - all within this thread. So reply to this first, and then the 1st response, and then the next response, etc. Make sense? Let’s try this out.
@thushi997 @prattprattpratt @MarvelStudios The first two yes - the third one no.
@Lindstor No.
@patgallahue @rodrialg Yes. They have the same deep wounds and for one of the first times in either of their lives they feel, in that moment, a connection to someone else.
@MProkopf @NickSchiltz Also, kinda surprised the information about how much time I’ve taken off is out there.
@MProkopf @NickSchiltz A) If it’s already out there why do the vast majority of people not know it? B) Thanks for your advisement on how creativity works, I’m sure a result of your vast success and experience. God knows I’m the first creative person to speak out against tyrants and traitors.

Trump has taken off more time since he's been President than I have over the past five years combined. I'll admit part of this is probably MY issue. But, still. He's the guy who said, "I would not be a president that takes time off!”
Trump meeting with Kim Kardashian today. 110 visits to golf clubs. Still hasn't gone overseas to meet with the troops in the Middle East, like the past four Presidents all did in their first year.
@Justin_Lubin @realDonaldTrump Yes. He does that almost every day. He is like the Hulk, but without strength or muscles.
@xxxorcist_ You might find this hard to believe, but I didn't set the price point.
@_whosmanisthis_ Just over the end credits. I don't think it fits the "that was you" category.
@_Stray_x I've honestly never seen it.

I was on Ambien when I shot my scene for Movie 43. https://t.co/mtJnCjiO0k
@renato_mariotti @CheriJacobus Oh my God.
@GregAalberts I didn’t admit to any “bad sex life items,” only embarrassing, kinky stuff either solo or between consenting adults, but thanks for the assumption. 😐
@realDonaldTrump Translation: “How is everything about ME and how I’m a victim?”
But Ambien can cause people to say the truth about themselves, as I once spent 2 hours on Periscope while in Bogota, Colombia at 3 a.m. answering fans’ questions about the most intimate details of my sex life. Some of you still love to bring this up. I have since quit Ambien. https://t.co/OfwFc1GU7J

@BlackIceSheep @incestishalal I wouldn’t support lying and falsehoods no matter what. So no I don’t feel the same about many.
@BlackIceSheep @incestishalal I disagree completely. That said, even if you believe what Soros did was absolute evil (I think that’s goofy), the tweet is still completely FALSE. He was not a Nazi. He did not turn over other Jews. Why is that so difficult to understand?
@taotaotao His dad deletes tweets all the time (like when he spelled Melanie’s name wrong a week or so ago).
@incestishalal I’ve seen the video. He wasn’t a Nazi. And like I said he was NINE when the war started and he didn’t turn over Jews to be murdered. This is what Trump Jr retweeted.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You retweeted a false tweet that claimed a Jewish man who was 9 when the war started was a Nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered and you still haven’t taken it down. And you have the gall to say “facts don’t matter”?! What’s wrong with you?!
You retweeted a false tweet that claimed a Jewish man who was 9 when the war started was a Nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered and you still haven’t taken it down. And you have the gall to say “facts don’t matter”?! What’s wrong with you?! https://t.co/GEcMymYLi2
@JonathanEby He or she seems a bit too mellow to be a bot/sock puppet. But who knows.
@f1xxxar You have a very low bar for success. Like I said, same processing power he uses to tan.
@f1xxxar For the record, most people say the Iraq war is a mistake now. But Trump supported it while it was happening. https://t.co/0QxbEeR86s
@Mtayeb98 🤮
@f1xxxar So? I didn’t say all fashion blind people can’t make good choices. I merely said Trump specifically.
@Rumpmeak All the points were irrelevant to my tweet, which was about freedom of speech. But the orange thing grabbed me.
@BrainfreezeCas We have him as President.
@kylegriffin1 I wish they were more honest and just say “something, anything, other than the easy availability of guns.”
@Jhhardage I used to watch him on the Apprentice and think - boy, that guy's lucky his Dad is the host of a reality TV show so he gets a job judging Brett Michaels making cupcakes, because that's the best he's gonna do.
Finally, Eric Greitens, the pus-filled cold sore crawling with maggots on the lip of my home state, is OUT. I think his lifelong plan to become President has gone somewhat awry.
Let me share some info that might help you. In my decades of life I have never been called a Nazi, despite being wedding dress white. So maybe it ISN’T your skin color that’s prompting the term. https://t.co/PhzMyWG9zc
@Lindowitz @ABCNetwork I do apply it to that.
@SugaryAshes @ABCNetwork The US government and a US corporation are two different entities, who can and do say different things. It’s pretty simple.
@LukeBarnesy Looks like.
@rstephensx87 @TheFactsKris @ABCNetwork Haha, yeah, it is absolutely simply semantics.
@asomer @ABCNetwork It is in the tweet I tweeted - an many, many others all over twitter right now. I realize it's not like this to all conservatives.
@FairlyOrdinary We need your Mom right now to explain to a lot of folks these simple concepts.
@TheFactsKris @ABCNetwork Freedom of speech doesn't defend racists. But it does say someone shouldn't be arrested for saying something racist unless it's a hate crime. That doesn't mean that racist speech is moral - and where "something racist" becomes "hate crime" can be nebulous.
@zenelectron @ABCNetwork Of course. But it's not a freedom of speech issue.
@RobertIger 👍
@ratd1985 ❤️
The entire Guardians cast likes to help out in all departments although sometimes, like @zoesaldana here, they aren’t exactly happy about it. #behindthescenes https://t.co/2ayqM3ahon
@glyff3083 @Hiiamhanson At what point in that video does he say, quoting you quoting him, it was "The best time of his life." Time code, please. And at what point does it say he ratted out fellow Jews? If you can provide either of those things, I'll apologize for reporting you (spoiler: you can't).
@Cland107 Si.
@glyff3083 @Hiiamhanson LOL. First of all, you're likely a sock puppet. Secondly, cowards are anonymous here own Twitter, like you. Thirdly, Soros doesn't say your quote, nor did he "rat out" Jews. So I'm reporting you for targeted harassment against him as should everyone else. Clear enough?
And, no, hurricanes can't be stopped yet. But the problem is the government has actively covered up this number for many months and, secondly, many of the deaths happened afterwards and were preventable.
@OceanRageM The difference is, the majority of the deaths happened afterwards and were preventable.
More American citizens died in Hurricane Maria than 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina and, so far, approximately the same amount as both combined.
@ToyAddict80s I defended Trump many times against the allegations of child rape, because they didn't seem legitimate. So stick to being ignorant.
When Trump visited Puerto Rico, he congratulated himself on the low death toll and said they should be "very proud". Then he want on to say Maria wasn't “a real catastrophe like Katrina." Like Trump did yesterday with Memorial day, he tried to use the occasion to prop himself up.
Over three times as many people died in Hurricane Maria as in Hurricane Katrina. And still the people are suffering. Again and again, Trump has ignored the problem or actively combated the people trying to help. https://t.co/vzrgcnDM0n
@ToyAddict80s Just like I'd defend Trump if someone said he turned Jews over to the Nazis. What makes me sick is people thinking ANY accusation is okay against someone they don't like.
@DanForinton She isn't. Neither is the President. But they are still doing damage.
@boracho80 Sorry, Germany. We're trying to be better, I swear.
@anonymous_ben It means he didn't turn favors with the Nazis. But what do I expect from a guy who makes facts what he wants them to be, like how you just tweeted "5 people" booed Giuliani at the Yankees game. Muted. https://t.co/omfnG0xw8U
@anonymous_ben It doesn't mean you don't have sex with kids, either. See how that works?
@ava @VictoriaMahoney @chrismcquarrie @edgarwright @FilmBayona @rianjohnson @ed_solomon @mang0ld @clmazin @briankoppelman @RealGDT @MarcW After writing a screenplay for @Troma_Team (for $150) &amp; making movie, I wrote many screenplays &amp; submitted everywhere I could. I was noticed by Dimension who optioned screenplay for nothing. But they never made the movie. It wasn't until I got agent/manager that I got work.

@benshapiro Everyone claiming the joke went over my head: you don’t understand. Obviously Shapiro is making a joke. Part of that joke is not misusing the word “parenthesis“; the correct use would be “how a parenthesis works.” One wouldn’t say “how shoe work” or “how scissor work.” Get it?
@im_verified David Hogg never even used the word “parenthesis,” much less incorrectly. Clearly. Or, wait, let me guess. You didn’t even understand what I was talking about. Shocker.
@murcat410 @KevWeldon Absolutely wrong. He would have needed to say “how a parenthesis works” to have used the word correctly.
@vestigiousvege1 @benshapiro @davidhogg111 No he used the word “parenthesis” wrong. It’s not part of the joke.
@J_sandy1009 @dumb_daredevil @synthhCSGO @benshapiro @davidhogg111 It was not correct, no.
@BartlettKellogg @benshapiro @davidhogg111 He was using the word “parenthesis” incorrectly in a facetious manner? That’s deep.
@synthhCSGO @benshapiro @davidhogg111 Wanna bet?
@MisterJ831 @MikeRathbone86 @benshapiro “The dictionary is fake news” and “I’m not as smart as I think I am” would be good arguments for Ben to make. There. I gave him a head start.
I can’t get over 15k people liking a tweet where an adult man, @benshapiro, corrects a teenager’s grammar while he himself is using incorrect grammar. Unbelievable. This can only be seen as evidence that @davidhogg111’s original thesis is correct.
@KevWeldon @murcat410 Yes, thanks. Absolutely wrong. But Murcat could have known that when he wrote that parenthesis is defined as “the thing” - singular.
@killer1986chris Who are you talking to?
@WhiteWolf9876 You don’t know me very well.
@Bryson_M @benshapiro The poster. But they’re lame also.
@mark_earnest He’s neither of those things.
@benshapiro How fucking lame do you have to be to correct someone’s grammar while your own grammar (“parenthesis”) is incorrect? This is Dunning-Kruger in full force.
You don’t know it yet, but “parenthesis” is singular, dumbfuck. https://t.co/tAUdxj4BXM
@InfamousSwoosh No.
@ClarkCollis So good.
@coraliefargeat @deadpoolmovie @DavidMLeitch @VancityReynolds @MatildaLutz Honestly, truly wonderful work. Oh my those wonderful pinks and yellows and blues, those lovely contrasts of sterile beauty and absolute horror, and that earring. I loved it. Can't wait to see what you do next!
@memothegreatest @cambrody93 You'll find out!
@Aaliaoursbourn He doesn’t give a shit about them because they don’t have anything to do with his own personal fortunes or legal jeopardy.
@kumarbishnu202 @ccnomad Current Groot has only had the Guardians as parents, so of course his name is Groot.

@droppedsync_LM Another moment when I stand baffled by someone responding to a tweet about one specific thing with a completely other topic, as if that’s what we were talking about all along.

Yesterday I finally saw @deadpoolmovie 2, which I loved, and also the brilliant #Revenge. Two completely different, fantastic films - cinema's alive! Thanks @DavidMLeitch @VancityReynolds @coraliefargeat @MatildaLutz for a great day at the movies.
@Trippy_4_Lyfe @RobZombie @RookerOnline Nope!!
@GeorgeTakei @MonkeySensei77 Oh my!!!
@akrdu2 @maggieNYT She’s being a journalist and calling something a falsehood when it’s untrue but can’t be proven as a lie. Why are so many people attacking her instead of Il Douche himself?
@MhWalt3067 I didn’t miss it - I tweeted the recording earlier.
@DansDaMan @traytaymakeup 👆Still hasn’t learned how Twitter works.
@realDonaldTrump STOP LYING.
This tweet is STILL up, 9 hours after the recording of a WH official giving the quote was released. Why would anyone believe you when you say anything, including “No collusion”? If you lie about this dumb shit you’ll definitely lie about stuff that could send you to prison. https://t.co/l15z9FtEHc
@JakeBoyardi There is behind the scenes gag footage of this happening on the DVD but it was never part of the movie - just all of us playing a joke on Bautista

@MichaelVatuone @Real_Ion777y @MediaOracle @realDonaldTrump No, that is definitely not correct. That is not a long term possible business strategy.
@Real_Ion777y @MediaOracle @realDonaldTrump In my 15 or so years of social network interaction, this is by far my greatest.
@Real_Ion777y @MediaOracle @realDonaldTrump He lies about for the same reason he lies about so many things - because he's a giant ball of insecurity who can't stand not being seen as something other than what he is. Most all of his business have been huge failures. https://t.co/7SmevyrAEj
@Bunny_Fastard @realDonaldTrump Accurate.
@Real_Ion777y @MediaOracle @realDonaldTrump For the record, he's lying about being a billionaire - and every billionaire I know - &amp; I know a few - believe he is not. Trump sued Timothy O Brien for saying he wasn't a billionaire &amp; he couldn't prove in court that he was - Trump lost the suit.
@realDonaldTrump Stop. Lying. About. Every. Single. Damn. Thing. You. Horrible. Heartless. Failure. Of. A. President. And. Human. Being.
@armyofsatire @MrJonCryer @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Just because you're called Army of Satire, doesn't mean you need to be completely blind to sarcasm.
The fact that Trump keeps this tweet up an hour after the recoding of the WH official (Matt Pottinger) saying it on tape was released tells you how much our POTUS cherishes truth and non-fake news. https://t.co/s1kvnBs0mA https://t.co/KQspDh3Jfb
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Um, here’s the recording. Embarrassing, huh? People are going to start thinking you just lie all the time about everything and nothing out of your mouth has any validity whatsoever. https://t.co/ffKvPIBAjW
@KimberlySammon2 Happy Birthday!
@RedHood451 @GeorgeTakei No. Jesus, read the article.
Much love to @GeorgeTakei. It’s as important to share these moments of innocence as it is to share the moments of guilt. He’s a great man who has done a lot for people and it’s a shame his name was tarnished. ❤️ https://t.co/e1J8ecLDM2
@jaketapper And he isn’t “confused” as the @MilitaryTimes kindly assumes. He’s lying, as he does on a daily basis, knowing much of his base will just assume it’s the truth.
@scottderrickson @ac_gleason I agree. That article leaves something to be desired however.
@scottderrickson @ac_gleason Hey, Scott and James, it's an article from a right-wing magazine about how problematic Trump is (leaving out a LOT of the problems &amp; blaming other Presidents for his corruption)! This is a great time for me to criticize not him, but YOU GUYS!

@Princepessasand @prattprattpratt That would be @JennLholland &amp; @vonspears.
@TheOrlandoJones Thanks man
@semiheartless Allow yourself to write poorly. It’s okay. You have to wade through the bad to get to the good. And you don’t have to feel a certain way to write.
@MikeIsSavage The very end.
Well my first bit of advice is to always come up with the ending FIRST. Lacking that, I’d say write a shitty ending if that’s what you’ve got, and then rewrite it forty times, never afraid to make major changes, no matter how difficult it is, and see where you’re at. Godspeed! https://t.co/CeNC8xzA9Z
@kumailn What the fuck I want to see this shit.

@LizMarijic That thought did not escape me. But I decided to risk it.
@HeyItsMeLP You never have to defend your existence. You are what you are.

@josh_cooper_01 I appreciate that. I also agree that Trump won the election. However, that has nothing to do with believing he is a corrupt, unbalanced mobster who is dismantling the rule of law and the separation of powers.
@rumblesnap I’m not appealing to them. I’m asking you to help make a difference.
@realDonaldTrump NUTJOB!
If you believe in the Deep State, you really think they’d let a buffoon like Trump become President?  We have an honest-to-goodness Tin-Foil-Hat-John-Bircher-Sandy-Hook’s-a-Hoax-the-Earth-Is-Flat-Paul-Is-Dead nutjob conspiracy theorist as President of the United States.
@RivasTaro Yes, definitely.  The other biggest flag is when then think Snopes is a liberal tool.
@coreymacdazzle Definitely not true. If there's one candidate as corrupt as Trump, that's her.
@RickyAgyekum2 No, but the people who said Agrabah should be bombed are the same people who don't understand the difference between a statistical percentage of likelihood, and the percentage of a whole.
@JoeViller Disagree strongly. Twitter is a very effective tool for energizing people and getting them to vote, and that's all that matters.
Candidates' followers were polled during the primaries. 41% of Trump supporters were in favor of bombing Agrabah, the fictional city in Aladdin. At the same time, only 11% of John Kasich supporters said the same thing. Funny, appalling, or both?  https://t.co/OSSJkChecW https://t.co/y2CARgQb6F
@ratduck17 Too funny. I'm sharing this.
And, more importantly, our job is to VOTE, and to impel other folks (LIKE ALL OF YOU PLEASE) to VOTE, so that we can start to heal our broken government. Love to you all.
They are lost. Our job is simply to spread the most simple, easiest-to-understand information: Our President is trying to stop an investigation into his own activities, of which many, many crimes have been discovered, including those of his campaign officials.
But the fact that most of his support comes from IGNORANCE &amp; not the illogical mental gymnastics of so many folks here on Twitter is important. So I'm reminding myself again (and you too) our job is not to argue with those whose minds have been right-wing-media'd into oblivion.
Most of us reading this now know Trump is doing great damage to our Republic and our constitution, and we're going to feel the ramifications of this for a long time to come. It is our job as American citizens to rectify that the best we can.
If they do watch the news, it's a network that treats a girl in Utah who got made fun of for wearing a Chinese dress to prom as the biggest story of the year, and pretends that the Uranium One "scandal" wasn't discredited long ago.
This is in part due to a President who willfully, obviously, and shamelessly lies on a daily basis, knowing it helps him get away with one act of corruption and constitutional transgression after the next. And it's in part due to that they never watch or read the news, or -
But I actually think these almost heroically defiant, Dunning-Kruger Trump warriors are in the minority - they're just the majority of those active online. Most people just don't know what's going on.
I think those of us active on social media get used to the unbelievable amounts of denial &amp; cognitive dissonance in those who still support Trump despite KNOWING the outrageous amount of evidence that he's guilty of colluding with the Russians (and probably much more).
59% of Americans don’t know Mueller’s investigation has uncovered crimes (for the record, 17 indictments, 5 guilty pleas). https://t.co/V2GITjHXxR

RIP Philip Roth. This one hurts, both me and all of literature. He taught me when I was at Columbia and was a huge influence, impressing upon me the importance of writing through the hard times. I have many favorite books by Roth, but this is one of them. https://t.co/KbbvA7XR3w
@CarlosRangelz I’m telling you most have made it through something other than “knowing someone.” Not a single actor or producer on the Guardians movies were from Los Angeles. Almost no director or writer or actor in any Marvel movie.
@amaya_elijia @Woltrick That’s an Easter egg but not THE Easter egg.
@CarlosRangelz I’ve met him. I don’t know him well. Of the 30 or so writers I’m closest to none of them are even from California.
@CarlosRangelz I don’t know any successful writers who got where they are because of who they know. I’m from a small town in Missouri.

@MrJustinWilk Very and yes.
@Reblawrence12 I've done up to 20 many, many days.
@EmiliaBeaumont It's a not a bullshit myth, it's a general truth - writing every day is a good practice for folks who want to be professional writers. And that is definitely not shaming.
@InfintyStarLord Happy Birthday.
@DerekShoults Haha I know - I'm from St. Louis.
@andrhia It depends on your meaning of "when you planned to." For me, it's barely different at all (and I wrote much more than this in the beginning): https://t.co/guCr2qD2PO
When I'm in the middle of a screenplay, like now, I usually write 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week, taking breaks to drink coffee &amp; do more writing, like these tweets, &amp; then I watch TV with my gf &amp; pets for a couple hours at night. 1 day off every 2 weeks. Glamorous, isn't it? https://t.co/XeFGYvQlSA
@franticmonkey It's exactly like going to the gym.
@_DaveShep I know that I have to grind to get to the days where it comes naturally.
@DerekShoults He was 8 when he was abducted.
I'm not giving writing advice to set down rules on what needs to be, but simply sharing what works for me, because I love people and I like to see them thrive and I know how thirsty I was for advice when I was a young writer. More in this thread: https://t.co/3erO9EfbSm
And "writing every day" doesn't need to be seven or eight hours a day, although it usually was and is for me. Unless you have a physical or mental condition, people don't get "burnt out" writing two hours a day, every day, and that is a great start.
Of course folks need to recharge, I take occasional days off, and I don't write at all while I'm directing. That said, I spent many years working seven days a week, one or two days off a month, and I firmly believe it's what got me to the place I am now.
Twitter has its limitations, and I sometimes speak in absolutes. To clarify, I say "write every day" when I mean "What works for me is I write almost every single day, even when I don't feel like it." https://t.co/riCH9pGUPy
@AlSharptonXXXXL @hardwick @SethGreen Yes.
@thatonedude_87 @hardwick @SethGreen Because I am a larger human than people think I am and I am also leaning forward.

@jamiegoode Yes, but I would say art takes the same discipline as craft, for most.
@nikki__d @dave_gosh He didn't go to High School - he was abducted when he was 8!
@jamiegoode All writing is craft and art.
@Jenny_Trout 3 First, discipline and hard work are important. Second, you don't have to feel good when you write or feel good about your writing. You are okay the way you are. You don't need to judge yourself or wait for magic to be a writer.
@Jenny_Trout 2 So I apologize if my words weren't as specific as they could have or should have been. What I don't understand is why you jump to attacking me before asking me a question or two. I am trying to help people who want to be writers by instilling two things:
@Jenny_Trout I don't disagree with you. I do believe writing is not always putting words on a page, &amp; twitter has it's limitations so sometimes I speak in absolutes ("every day") when what I mean to say is "What works for me is I write almost every single day, even when I don't feel like it."
@phoenixnewtimes Sweet!
May 22 is almost as important as Christmas around the Gunn clan because it’s the birthday of 3 of my favorite beings in the world: my brother @thejudgegunn, my dog and best pal @vonspears, and my nephew Griffin, who I killed in #GotGVol2. https://t.co/xBxSEbTWR3

@ColinLawrence3 Both. And I’ve been writing Vol. 3 almost daily for over a year. It sometimes takes me much longer!
@BIGNOAH256 Oh yeah.
I get more negative responses from saying hard work is necessary to successful writing than I do from saying Trump is whiny and corrupt. I’m trying to figure out whether this is positive or not.
@AdamFowlerITV @anneleonardauth She did. But writing screenplays was not my first job. I worked in a quarry, at restaurants, in a hospital moving dead bodies around. I had the same attitude then and came home from work every day and wrote. It’s why I don’t have to do those jobs anymore.
@emi_dog You see him in a car in St. Charles Missouri barely avoiding death in Vol 2.
@sanchohack Oh that’s the way I meant meant my response - no way would I be doing what I’m doing without working as hard as I have.

@sanchohack No way.
@laine_ricketts Someday.
@violetblue Yep. Some of us don’t have the luxury to wait around for the muse.
@MichellCClark A great deal of them write daily or near-daily. But to each his own!
As I’ve already said, I don’t categorize it as “pushing,” but GRINDING is a part of success for most writers, artists, &amp; professionals of all sorts. I respect the grind &amp; I’ve definitely been able to arrive at magical moments through doing it. https://t.co/80JpspZokh
@MrKimaniM That doesn’t mean GRINDING isn’t a huge part of success in anything.
@EmmettScanlan watching you on safe right now! https://t.co/qdkXEm82ef
@jamiegoode I’ve worked professionally in all three fields - and for me it isn’t.
@GennHutchison I hear you. I didn’t mean it to come off as every day without fail. I write most days but I take break days as well, and barely write at all while directing.
@MrKimaniM I have worked professionally in acccounting, music, and writing and I think it is.
@EricMaroni3 He’s not worthy.
If Trump paid for an abortion, which is starting to seem to be the case, how will evangelicals react? And how will the fact it happened AFTER he won the election change the “he’s a changed man” line of defense? https://t.co/1MizLNRC73
@comicsdaughter Yes
@TommyFlanagan @theyearofelan Tommy is absolutely correct, and has some dignity left, unlike people who put their socks on before their pants.
@chrisbharrison I feel em during coffee breaks!
@TGatesC @Froggar5 Absolutely. A body builder builds his muscles by working them. We build our creative muscles the same way.
@franman781 I don't see the relationship between this and what I wrote.
@franman781 It's not easy. Writing is often hellish.
@StarkTower15 Fun.
@DrWillHatch It is more okay to write and feel insecure while doing so.
6 To be a professional writer, it helps to know both of these things:   Writing is magic.   It also is not.   I humbly request you do it with love, so that we all may be better for it.  And, yes, this applies to most everything else in life as well.
5 And just as much: you'll find a path to quality writing that becomes more clear every year. It never becomes easier. But it becomes less confusing, and the path and how to deal with perceived obstacles become more obvious as you rack up experience.
4 But, if you keep writing no matter what, eventually you'll find a line or a page or an entire story that is honest and True. Not lower case "true", but capital T "True", the kind that speaks to people's hearts: the kind that makes a difference.
3 Just write - something terrible, something ugly, something beautiful, something kind, something stupid, it doesn't matter - whatever is there now. Don't judge it. Or do. Again, even THAT doesn't matter, other than it's kinder to yourself not to judge.
2 Do not be tricked into thinking you need to feel any specific way while writing. Whatever you're feeling now is perfect. It's exactly where God or the universe or whatever intended you to be.
I'm not saying "push through" anything. That seems unnecessarily torturous. What I'm saying is just write words and sentences. Write the next page or the next line of dialogue the best you can RIGHT NOW. THREAD. https://t.co/wwYRueFVns
I never understand writers who say to wait for the muse or be “ in the right headspace” to write. Accountants go to work no matter how they feel. Musicians play a show they’ve agreed to no matter what. And writers need to sit down and write every day despite their feelings.
@E_Wong I have haha!!
@T1meTraveler01 @RobBobUK5 @Stemot1978 @cedrichouse1994 @ABXY_Chris @MarvelStudios These are released at the same time reviews are released, not after.
@T1meTraveler01 @RobBobUK5 @Stemot1978 @cedrichouse1994 @ABXY_Chris @MarvelStudios Again, these movies that did so well also had higher Cinemascores - which is the audience rating them. You can look them up here: https://t.co/nCBih6k8KP Are the audiences biased as well?
@T1meTraveler01 @RobBobUK5 @Stemot1978 @cedrichouse1994 @ABXY_Chris @MarvelStudios B) The public relations disaster of being caught would be horrible and of much more harm than getting bad reviews. And who would trust two hundred critics to keep their mouths shut???
@T1meTraveler01 @RobBobUK5 @Stemot1978 @cedrichouse1994 @ABXY_Chris @MarvelStudios Sure. Absolutely not. 100% no one from the studios are paying the critics. A) It wouldn't be worth it as audience reception is considered a much better indicator of how much money a movie will make (Cinemascore, which measures audience receptions, is more coveted than RT score).
@ElmntsofMadness Yes.
@T1meTraveler01 @RobBobUK5 @Stemot1978 @cedrichouse1994 @ABXY_Chris @MarvelStudios I can't believe you guys still have me on this thread.  That said, where is this critics' bias coming from? Is someone paying them? What's your theory on this?
The funniest tweets to me are the ones that accuse me of crying as they support a constantly weeping &amp; whining man-baby President who can't stop playing the victim (and who cried about Obama for 8 years straight). 👌 https://t.co/xFGYCduQZ1
@ATDIUSdhumire Yes, this is ONE indictment of MANY about ONE set of charges and it has nothing to do with Mueller's overall findings. If THAT'S your response, and you think it's relevant, you might consider you don't understand at all what's going on.
Trump probably knows a little more about what Mueller knows than the general public does - which is likely one of the reasons he is freaking the fuck out on twitter. Desperation. 0% chance an innocent person would behave in that fashion. https://t.co/AVcLklFpMB
@ATDIUSdhumire I'll save you the response. NO, Mueller has NEVER released anything close to a report on his findings. He's kept them totally hidden, as any investigator would investigating a crime. Anything we've discovered has been through publicly available reports on the various indictments.
@ATDIUSdhumire You got me. A detailed account of what?
@JWKieres @jtskaggs08 There were. And they cost more than the Mueller investigations so far. And ended with no indictments.  So, yeah, take another blind, desperate stab at an irrelevant reason not to investigate Trump!
Really happy to have someone from inside Mueller's office chiming in. Mueller hasn't revealed a single thing about what he's going after, or what was in Michael Cohen's files. So thanks for this insider info! https://t.co/RJitd9kQZm

Any one thing could be a coincidence or anomaly - but put them all up together &amp; a pattern of untoward relationships with Russia &amp; continuos attempts to hide those relationships is clear. https://t.co/4Rp17vac4D

@TotesMcGotes @mvandemar Mueller's job is to uncover the truth, not to stop Trump from being President. That's all we're asking for.
@spahn_r And they do. It's really sad.
Not to mention, the Mueller investigation has cost the equivalent of 2 Trump golf trips (he's had 95). So if you're really so concerned about the waste of money &amp; resources, please get on Mr. By-Far-Most-Time-Off-Ever-President about the $100 million or so spent on his vacays. https://t.co/IcuK0JqHcl
Mueller was charged with an investigation &amp; it is not his responsibility to share his evidence with the public. That said, 19 people &amp; 3 companies indicted, 5 people pleading guilty (3 of them being official members of Trump's campaign) is CERTAINLY NOT a waste of money NOR hype. https://t.co/O2TPs9k7Er
@TotesMcGotes You love having a President deathly afraid of being busted by the feds?
@ed_solomon @BrianLynch @alxwinter @TheFrankOzJam @GailSimone Anne Blanchard.
So even if Mueller was, as right wing media would have you believe, on some wild goose chase trying to “get” Trump (silly but let’s assume for a moment that’s the case), such an extraordinary amount of corruption has been uncovered the investigation would be worth it 100x over.
@Dolphins_Fan_11 I’ll assume this is a real question where you’re open to a real answer: most of the indictments have to do with money laundering with Russians or Russians trying to affect our elections. Most prosecutors think Mueller is building towards a link between the two and the Trumps.
By all measures it is, so far, an incredibly fruitful investigation. There is no logical reason for Trump’s panicked behavior &amp; desperation to stop it other than being afraid of his own illegal actions being revealed or those of people close to him (👋🏻 Don Jr.)
We know 19 people &amp; 3 companies have been indicted. We know 5 people have pled guilty, &amp; that 1 is serving jail time. We know 3 of the people who have pled guilty were part of Trump’s campaign. We know Trump himself has sanctioned indictees Mueller uncovered. https://t.co/adxmnQwmxS
@Old96er1 And five guilty pleas. And one person serving jail time.
@fullyspectrumed 🙋‍♂️
@waybeyondspace @HTrill24 :)
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT MUELLER HAS FOUND. Investigators aren't SUPPOSED to share their findings with the public (much less with the people being investigated) in the middle of the investigation. Why is this so hard?  But, yeah, there's definitely no "collussion." https://t.co/AZjFZZwqY8
@pooh6842 No way. Panic and aggression driven by overwhelming insecurity is his primary way of being. He has LOTS of emotions, but no ability to connect with or feel for others.
@Anthonysmdoyle @RobACrawfish PS What the hell does Bill Clinton have to do with this conversation? Everyone tries to turn everything into Republicans Vs. Democrats throughout history. They problem is Trump and the GOP TODAY.
@TigerMWD I honestly think it’s only the first of those three.
@Ryn0ceros @MichaelVatuone This is how bent people’s minds have become by right wing media. They think people not being investigated in any way are in trouble and people being investigated by numerous law enforcement agencies surrounded by indictments and guilty pleas are safe.
Yes, in part. If the NRA and the GOP hadn’t blocked the smart gun technology Obama was pushing 6 years ago, that kid wouldn’t have been able to use his father’s guns and those 10 people would be alive. https://t.co/C4v5StuVoO
I’ll also point out 2 days after kids died by gunfire (&amp; 2 weeks after Trump spoke at the NRA), this morning he never mentions them once &amp; simply goes crazy trying to prove HE’S not guilty by irrelevantly pointing fingers at anyone but himself. As usual, he is 100% self-serving.
Trump’s feed is so Presidential this morning. I’m glad to have such a stable genius in charge, completely in control, who is absolutely not shitting himself with fear right now, diarrhea just spilling out all over him as he’s drowning in it and sobbing. Glad that’s not happening.
@Howsito I have to think about it.
@Howsito Of all time? The Beatles, Queen, Elvis Costello. From that period? Probably the Replacements. I’m sure I will think of more.

@MattZilic Yes
@skippingjack That's probably not completely true as I watched Stripes a dozen times as a kid and don't know what song you're talking about (I mean, it's been over 30 years, but...)
@MattZilic No
@outdoor_myers @Aerosmith @alicecooper I’ve picked all the Guardians songs myself.
@kumailn @emilyvgordon is her own kind of royalty, and has better ears.
@GottaSaveBucky @Aerosmith @alicecooper Probably just too popular. Although I'll occasionally use a "The Chain" or "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" if they fit a scene PERFECTLY, I'll normally choose something not so well known.
I cannot count the number of times people have told me how either Marvel or Hollywood studios in general work. And, when I correct them, they tell me I'm wrong. Like if I got on here and started telling plumbers how pipes REALLY work. https://t.co/z1zPPtEjxi
@Seshat81 Groot.
I just checked. It was actually FOUR songs - Rubberband Man by The Spinners, Draw the Line by @Aerosmith, Train in Vain by The Clash, &amp; Caught in a Dream by @alicecooper. Here's a Spotify list of Awesome Mix 2.1 (with another song cut from the film). https://t.co/cFh7PsCb6W https://t.co/yHOQT4b5Uc
@sweatingbanshee No one is taking away anyone's rights. They're just adding restrictions - like smart gun tech - which will help prevent some deaths. It's "the right of people to bear arms", not "all arms." And it's a foregone conclusion that it's happening, it's just a matter of how long.
By far the smartest thing about Cox is that he didn't vote for you. I suppose the best way of getting back at him and sinking his boat is your endorsement, so, touché. https://t.co/9rNDDwbQ56
@sweatingbanshee I'll be more clear: Our movies are all exactly the same. Australia has one or two video games that are different. But the gun laws are very different. You're "not inclined" to accept proposals because you're living in a self-serving belief system, not one of evidence and logic.
@ImKhan70 @DannyZuker No.
@calpha5 @WayTooWitty No that’s exactly how it worked. Kevin was always the leader on the film front, but there WAS oversight from others. The minute they left that completely changed, and many restrictions were gone.
@DannyZuker First time it’s been used today.
@calpha5 @Nite2359 @WayTooWitty @MarvelStudios Perlmutter is gone from Marvel Studios and has been for some time.
@Drakonarus @rahman_risalat Yes, I am working on it now.
@bob75123 @sinKEVitch That’s just absolutely not true.
@sweatingbanshee Censorship exists here as well. Movies and video games are almost exactly the same in those countries.
@KimHoll77281338 @raphaelduncan The smart gun laws Obama tried to move forward would have stopped the atrocity in Texas yesterday. So there you go.
@TotesMcGotes All of those things are very similar in other countries with no school shootings. What’s different? Gun laws.
@NickWil62851342 No.

@sinKEVitch https://t.co/HtmLLtn20e
My movies play unedited in Australia, Japan, England - places where gun violence is almost non-existent. What’s different? They have stricter gun laws. Fantasy is not reality. People should quit trying to pretend it is to avoid discussing #GunReform. https://t.co/VDPzd7EoT9
@lukatorres @MarvelStudios Yes
It may seem paradoxical, but the reason @MarvelStudios is as successful as it is is that it’s not about money for any of the folks in charge - it’s simply about loving the magic of movies. https://t.co/Eg7LJ3Z5ep
You have it on your iPhone right now. https://t.co/M5YyhDHuPQ
@PlainMushroomWt See? The research pans out.
The #NRA does not care. Their sole goal is more money for gun manufacturers. They are unwilling to honestly assess how many lives are lost in this pursuit - and even oppose study of the situation. For Trump and the GOP, NRA fundraising money is worth kids' lives. 🌊 https://t.co/O75m9qp35Q
@Mark_Mares017 Gun reform is about reducing the numbers of deaths at guns. Everyone knows we can't completely stop them at this point. This, along with other measures, would work towards that goal.
@baconandtomato It is ready. If you own an iPhone, you already have it on your phone.
@see081480 Sorry, dude. I have to mute you. Your comments are getting too goofy.
Smart Gun technology makes it so only the authorized owner of a gun can fire the gun. We should discuss having this mandatory in all guns - yet it's something else the NRA battles. The deaths today would not have happened were it in play.
@see081480 Single entry buildings? You want to inhibit school shootings and make sure all the kids burn to death in a fire instead?
@disneyxpixiex Good luck!
@rahman_risalat Yes I am.
“President Trump promises action after new high school shooting.” Yeah, we’ve heard that before, and he ended up speaking at the NRA a couple months later; Trump is always willing to sell out our children’s lives for money. https://t.co/xaWMiNOQtN

So let me get this straight. The Trump team’s new defense is that getting dirt from Russia is not illegal? So has Trump’s rallying cry changed from “NO COLLUSION” to “OKAY, YES, COLLUSION, BUT YOU CAN’T PUT ME IN JAIL FOR IT!”? https://t.co/im82sy2yxH

@orestesmayo @ChrisSimms77 @realDonaldTrump Yes, sorry.
@cultofmovies It starts with people’s different opinions. It’s magnified by the media, Facebook, organizations like Cambridge Analytica, and Trump’s incendiary words, lies, and policies.
@fantasticalcam I’m waiting!
@kcxviii @realDonaldTrump When it first came out he cheated with a porn star - and you can check my tweets on this - I said it wasn’t an important issue. Falsifying public documents to cover up this fact is a much different story.
@ChrisSimms77 @realDonaldTrump Calling it a “Witch Hunt” while 19 have been indicted and people from his own campaign have PLED GUILTY is about as goofy as a claim can get.
@realDonaldTrump It’s rather sad that you would call anything “fake” the day after being caught illegally lying on your financial disclosures about paying a porn star to shut up about the time you cheated on your wife with her.
If your goals are to divide our country worse than any time since the Civil War, get the rest of the world to hate us, batter the rule of law and separation of powers, and treat the Presidency as your personal slot machine - yes, I can see where you’d consider it successful. https://t.co/tov7TH3bnt

@TyrantValnir @gilldaniels @rrw315 You love that fake news, huh?  Both of those things are completely false. Trump won by 56.9% of the electoral college vote. Obama won by 61.7% in 2012 and 67.8% in 2008. And there are no signs of HRC running again - she's said she won't - and she's almost certainly not going to.
@dmarlow2323 Just complete nonsense. Russian money supported Trump, firstly, and Bernie and Jill Stein secondly (probably just to take votes from Hillary). Every single act that happened was to hurt HRC. Saying she's in bed with the Russians is just completely freaking crazy.
@ZiggyFakeMcCoy Not all languages are in the translator.
@Ranger_Tyler88 @Marvel He doesn't have the money to buy a Mjolnir prop, much less the studio.
Trump has failed at nearly every business venture and relationship in his life. With his track record, it would be foolish to believe he'd be successful running the business of our country. It's like turning over Marvel Studios to Ed Wood.
Or supporting people boycotting the NFL, an American business close in size to his much beloved coal industry, and celebrating their damaged ratings. He's a President who actively tries to hurt the U.S. economy and American workers when folks' opinions differ from his. https://t.co/8wRSV62AyX
@Ahlyssa_xo @omnigorn Nor an increasing threat.

@noobandblond @pennjillette @TomArnold @YonduUd0nta @aholmes4418 Their show in Vegas truly IS one of my favorite shows in the world. So you can still see it.
@Duffmid @pennjillette @TomArnold @YonduUd0nta @aholmes4418 That was weird as fuck.
Again, bots are not Trump supporters &amp; "bot" is a terrible slang term to use for actual people - not because it's mean, but because it works in the service of disinformation &amp; against TRUTH. And that's the most important battle taking place today. https://t.co/5MreEXg2Dl
So to stop bots it's important to distinguish who they are AND who they aren't. You can use an app like https://t.co/hawqoQ0Oob to detect bots - they aren't perfect, but they are at least somewhat accurate in detecting who is real and who is a bot or sockpuppet.
Again - bots &amp; sockpuppets are real. There are run by farms of employees in Russia being paid to sow disorder in US politics. Their pages are usually mostly retweets of the same handful of sites &amp; they often glut responses to Trump here on twitter. https://t.co/NuRVdrBjNF
This way of looking at it hurts the cause. Blurring the lines between fact and fiction is the PURPOSE of bots. By calling actual Trump supporters "bots" you are helping to fulfill that mission. Not only that, you look crazy and somewhat paranoid to real people. https://t.co/BMBSCBfwpg
@RoverDal Sock puppets, again, are a specific thing - they're bots who have an employee also manually using them to spread a POV, usually in support of Trump. If someone uses the term bot for both bots and sock puppets it doesn't bother me. But I wouldn't call actual Trump supporters that.
@realTomCody It's important to distinguish between the two, because bots are incredibly harmful thing in our society, and by calling people "bots" it continues to give them power.
@GrimmCookies Hmmm. Weird. What's the actual twitter tag?
I suggest everyone be more careful about how we use the word "bot." Bots are programmed fake identities (or partially programmed "sock puppets") - often from Russia, created to seed disorder in the US. A real person who supports Trump is NOT a bot.

@aholmes4418 But he DID use racial epithets, and he did try to keep ALL blacks from renting his properties, and he did say blacks, in general, were lazy, etc. That's all technically, and obviously, racist. And there are many more examples. I'm not taking one thing and trying to build a case.
@aholmes4418 I didn't say he did.
@DreadCentral @lloydkaufman I understood why you thought that. Not a problem. Thanks for updating it.

3 Trump is and always has been a racist and it takes incredible mental gymnastics to claim otherwise. But I guess this is just another thing people are supposed to ignore because you like some other aspect about him.
2 Or when he said a Mexican judge would be biased in his case because of his Mexican heritage, or when he said Haitian immigrants “all have aids,” or that he has retweeted white nationalists numerous times without apology, etc, etc, etc.
Sure! Let’s not jump to cries of racism after Trump’s real estate company tried to avoid renting to blacks, or after he used racial epithets on the set of the Apprentice, or after he called Mexican immigrants rapists, or when he said “laziness is a trait in blacks” - cont’d - https://t.co/DUJbvCVtjO

Not only is Trump lying when he says it’s the first time in 10 years the military was given a raise - they’ve been given one almost every year - Obama gave them a 50% HIGHER raise at the same point in his Presidency. Trump continuously cries “Fake news” and yet lies constantly. https://t.co/EQgZciR0fn
@mang0ld @chrismcquarrie @itsdylandawn I couldn’t be any more on board with this.
@Doc_Solomon No. She's dying of cancer. That would be awful.
@DonovanChase9 Yes. Very.
@theyearofelan @politico Yes.
Trump is too much a cliche - the boring, vain, stupid, and corrupt stereotype - to ever make an interesting character in a comic book movie. https://t.co/UMAJX5uCXC
@Drewguy_007 This is specifically about Cohen and Trump knowing, no one else, and Trump tweeting a veiled threat. It's not about just not coming forward. It's about using the women and the situation for their own purposes.
@Fergalquigley I love Ireland but we're gonna fix this shit over here, thanks!
So Trump knew about the women’s allegations against Schneiderman 5 years ago and did nothing about it except a threatening tweet? WTF. How are we supposed to see this as anything but Trump holding blackmail info on Schneiderman? https://t.co/FvLXgznDq4
@christinawilkie It’s hard to see this not as a case of holding blackmail info over Schneiderman in case they needed it.
@politico No shit.

@mvandemar I’m not sure about the IQ tests or the polygraphs - but the financial disclosures? Absolutely.
@JoeBooRadley We had a President who says facts aren’t facts and attacked journalists multiple times a week? Who decried science? Who backed out of the Paris accords? Who hired a cabinet who actively espouses going to war with Iran? Who had a constantly revolving staff? Etc, etc, etc? No.

@thiirteen I had some objections with some aspects of the script at the time, and those are no longer a part of the story. I am pleased with where the story went.
I read and gave notes on the scripts for both IW and Avengers 4 a couple years ago; I knew of any ramifications by the time I started the script to Vol. 3 a year ago. https://t.co/gejiDxeBP1
@eliotgammaray @sailordeath That was an ancient version of the Sovereign's cocoons.
@Cireh35 He is owned by Fox and can't currently be a part of the MCU.
@heathercampbell @rianjohnson Haha I love to take the plunge once in a while. Although I have been sent some truly horrible stuff in the past.
@RebelQuique You understood incorrectly. It was very important to me that he was not an adult, story-wise. This is why he was set up as an adolescent at the end of Vol. 2.
@sailordeath It’s a cocoon - we don’t know how long he’ll take to bake.
@heskingJC No he won’t
@film_atic Nope. Those are nuns.
@Renton127 Happy Birthday!
Because I love Adam Warlock and didn’t want him left out of the MCU entirely. I wanted to create a space for him that would have to be filled at some time. Look at how long that first Thanos tease took to be fulfilled - and that turned out okay! https://t.co/b2VMbHPodo
@tate_oconnor1 @realDonaldTrump My country is more important to me than having fans, but I’m sorry that you feel that way.
@Ahlyssa_xo @jobflobadobYob @Saurocron @Alex_Everatt Yes, Groot’s language isn’t (and can’t be) in the translators. Some other languages are not in there as well (Old Sakarran). And so the Guardians were freaked out when Thor knew Groot, because they thought they were the only ones who could understand him.
@Shashan56555497 You may be right that Kraglin is not worthy. But he is the one Yondu loved. Also, Avengers 4 has already been shot.
@its_mr_Timmons @Legoindy7734 We’ve gotten the rights for every song I’ve ever wanted. I love Queen - one of my favorite bands and the one I’m most asked about. But it has to be the perfect song for the perfect scene and that hasn’t happened yet.
@darwinfdez1 Hi
@realDonaldTrump I love how you can tell which tweets were actually written by Trump, like this one, because they seem to be written by an eight-year-old in the midst of a psychotic break.
@Ethan_Anderton I’ve gotta quit rushing and fucking - major weakness of mine.
@johnjohnA111 @TMZ I will not take that bet, no
@markg63 Haha on the way back
@alexandra88 @TMZ Oh yeah it goes on long after this
@jawfreelok @TMZ Yes it was from Donald Trump.
I was stopped by TMZ at the airport &amp; the guy asked me if I’d kill Batman if he was in GotG. I said “Sure.” “How?” “I don’t know, maybe throwing him off a roof.” So now these are the kinds of DMs I’m getting on IG. Calm down, guys. I’m not really going to kill Batman, I promise. https://t.co/dcQxocya7I

@daggxrslight Well, I love Nebula, and she's an important character. But MCU canon is different from 616 canon.
@jpol1313 @LesSavyTrav This is true.
@AmbassadorOfCA I never, ever said any such thing.
@HouseofStarke I don't know the names of many characters I saw once in a movie four years ago.
@Gretagroupie His name is not Tree.
@willie_brown8 I did not.
@red_odinson Yes
@Toadkiri Groot is not understood through a translator, nor are some other languages.
@TheFknLizrdKing @NotSoCombo2 Groot has a mouth like a sailor. Didn't you see Vol 2?
@PopTartJesus_ Yes, apparently she's the most important character in Infinity War.
@deshain2 @IMASCARYLION @Legoindy7734 There are many great Queen songs! One of my favorite bands. Just never found the right place/right song.
@kgbdev1 Oh brother I'm on TMZ?
@JoshEwanWilson It isn't.
@StarLaura37 I never said he was or wasn't but no I did not!
@fireapplered You're responding to a tweet that answers that question.
-Adam Warlock will NOT be in Avengers 4 (and I've never said he will be in Vol. 3). -GotG Vol. 3 will be set AFTER Avengers 4. -No, I will not give any hints on the Easter Eggs. -Yes, all of the Guardians now understand Groot, as in IW.
@LesSavyTrav It's definitely NOT the first time. It's been going on for a long time.
@KeyWatkins51299 All of the Guardians DO understand Groot in IW.
@_julialeigh That's what my tweet explained.
@DonoBlack And of course gave notes on the cut film as well.
@DonoBlack Of course not. The Russos didn't personally tell me about what happened during plotting - BEFORE the script was written - but Kevin Feige did talk it over with me at that time. It was fine by me and then I gave pages and pages of notes on the two scripts when they were finished.
@KeyWatkins51299 Yes they do. They are as common to space travelers as cell phones are to humans, probably more so.
-The big Easter Egg has not been found (not in either Vol. 1 or Vol. 2) -No, I am not making up the Easter Egg. -There are actually a ton of unfound Easter Eggs in Vol. 2. -Kraglin is off doing something important during Infinity War. He will return.
-And also how to repair a broken cassette tape or player. 😐 -The Guardians each have a translator implanted so that they can both understand AND be understood by others. -Young Groot does not have the memories of the Groot from the first movie.
Guardians Incredibly Frequently Asked Questions - -Kraglin's fin at the end of Vol 2 is a different fin than Yondu's. -Yes, I pick all the songs for the movies. -The Guardians can travel light years in space, OF COURSE they can figure out how to power a Walkman/Zune w/o batteries
@Samuel_Zelin It's a different fin.

@Adambath They kind of looked silly the whole time when they believed Trump saying their were millions of illegal voters and, without them, he would have won the popular vote, all based on... nothing. Not a single shred of evidence to back it up.
4. Either one of these reasons makes Trump a vomitous human being. But, more importantly, if our election process in this country is not sacred, what is? And no matter how much you like some of his policies, how can you support a President who won’t combat cheating in elections?
3. Trump’s detractors say it’s because his campaign, with or without his cooperation, actively worked with the Russians to illegally undermine our election and our Republic.
2. His supporters in Washington claim Trump doesn’t want to address it because it makes him look “weak” and reminds people he didn’t win the popular vote. That’s his SUPPORTERS.
1. More facts keep coming out about the Russian interference into the 2016 election. Now the Senate says the Russians were able to “alter or delete voter registration data.” And yet our President still has done nothing to combat this. THREAD. https://t.co/2ZX5NeHPy7

@birbigs @imchriskelly Line 8 was the worst line of the night and it got an A? wtf
@JordanPeele 👍👍👍
@michaelrosenbum @piratesbooty What in the world are you talking about?
@I_Am_Hambone @ShereKhan_ You don’t understand the argument. Putin’s objective is to destabilize the US and weaken our relationships with other counties while strengthening their own. This very much makes sense in the shadow of that.
@passingashuman Which is why he’s gone bankrupt 6 times and has to lie about being a billionaire.
@Naim_Dor Israel has to CHANGE the information they gave out. You know this, right?
@scorpio8675309 That makes absolutely no sense. They now have nothing stopping them from manufacturing nukes. Everyone on Trump’s own team said they were abiding by the deal.
@Naim_Dor Everyone on Trump’s national security team has testified under oath that Iran has abided by the deal. So how do you think that’s happening exactly?
@fugQalliance It doesn’t matter if it was a bad deal or a good deal. Backing out of it is a dreadfully stupid piece of diplomacy that signals to the world all our deals mean nothing and can be changed at the whims of any temporary four year leader.
Trump did a marvelous job today reneging on the Iran Deal &amp; letting the world know the United States can not be trusted. Now the integrity of our country’s word is as meaningless as that of our cheating, lying, colluding President. Putin couldn’t be happier: mission accomplished.
@doctor__general Yes, probably. I’m not big on improvising.
@snooprodrigo Yes
Tyler scores to the screenplay with a lot of guidance from me. Then I design shots &amp; often do animated story boards around the music. And then we shoot to the music. Sound is as important as picture in movies yet it’s often treated as an afterthought! https://t.co/OETZERj5ce
@sfortco I’ve been shooting a film so I haven’t had time to share music.
@Emildg @AppleMusic Sure
@RWBY_Fan10000 @4VENG32 I have never said Adam is in Vol. 3
Most the songs get played while shooting scenes on he Guardians films - often in ear buds in my ears, the camera crew &amp; the cast - so we know exactly what we’re shooting to rhythmically &amp; tonally. We also record much of @tyler_bates’ score before shooting &amp; play that on set too. https://t.co/hrnCwYwUzc
@jonbaltz It was not.
@theSteaknEggs Less than 1% on the first film; less than 2% on the second film.
@IamJaseTeeW “Just”?
@DJEssp Various sources - the art department folks do some, visual effects do others - I had an Easter egg committee on Vol. 2 with @Simonlikes &amp; Mary Livanos who would pitch ideas to me. And then a few are all me.
Each of the 3 films has a separate master playlist with over 500 songs (there’s some overlap between the playlists). These are whittled down to lists around 100 songs &amp; finally to the Awesome Mixes. Perhaps someday I’ll release the master playlists. https://t.co/kuHdJ27mKx

@Botanygeek Well except in the films, if one pays attention, Groot2 does not have the mind or memories or personality of Groot1, so this would nullify the stored memories theory.
@A_Eucatastrophe @ManMadeMoon I don’t know enough to go into details. Essentially they charge anything they can to a production. I’ve never had a film go into profit by a studio’s definition - even after well over a billion and a half on the Guardians films.
@RealLilleeJean I have never said he was the result of asexual reproduction but, even if he was, he would no more be the same Groot than identical twins are each other.

@Abigail_Werner No.
@Treaos_Serrare @adamctierney @StormyDaniels No. That isn’t what happened. The problem is Trump illegally funneled campaign funds into trying to shut her up — AND perhaps had her life threatened. It’s not the sex.

@DaveWeasel @CoreyTaylorRock @StormyDaniels He does indeed
@stuarthazeldine @Zwaid47 @scottderrickson Screenwriters definitely get less respect. They get less praise when something goes right - but also less blame when something goes wrong.

@brucefloyd Super. 45 to 53 setups a day, one camera, sometimes more.
@eodguy89d There are people like that on my sets but they usually aren’t chosen by me
@dlesica No. I’m driven by possibility, faith, love, and creativity. Stress gets in the way.
@DelgadilloArt @mang0ld Troma’s making-of movies are the closest to what it’s actually like being on set, warts n all, cc @lloydkaufman
@elizabethxolsen I’m doing what I believe is how I can best be of service to the world and other people, and I’m doing what I think I’m best at. It is fairly fulfilling and I love it at times. But, in all honesty, if I really did what I loved I’d probably be playing with dogs and penguins.
@SteveRosenberg @karengillan @RookerOnline Writing a novel is very rewarding. Directing is rewarding. I generally do not find screenwriting things I don’t direct rewarding.
That said, I am fucking hilarious almost always.
@LastBoss79 Less than 1% and no not much.
You’re not seeing me screaming when someone screws up a prop, or @karengillan picked up at 2:30 am to put on 5 hours of makeup, or hours painstakingly trying to light a set, or me getting @RookerOnline to say a line 70 times in a row, or me working 18 hours on 2 hours of sleep.
I think when you’re restricted to seeing only the behind-the-scenes video and pics we choose for you to see filmmaking looks a lot more fun than it actually is. Imagine only seeing videos of waiters cracking jokes in the kitchen and pretending THAT’S waiting tables. https://t.co/mMKR7KJaJL
@thehill “Let’s just change the lies around every two or three days to keep them on their toes.”
@vsriramcbe I’ve made entire movies for $1,500, $350,000, $3 million, and $200 million. It is mostly an INTERNAL journey and I do not find a substantial difference in ease at the various budget levels.
@TeknicolorTiger Comparing art forms is very important for people who are trying to figure out what to do with their lives. You need to know the differences between them and the personal strengths and weaknesses they can endure.
@ScottHiga No. A bigger budget means there are more factors - that’s more stressful. But a smaller budget is more stressful because it’s harder making it happen and you’re generally working with less experienced people.
@geekcartel @prattprattpratt He is very easy to deal with if not for the horrible stench.
@jzagri Pray, exercise, and meditate.
But in all of this I acknowledge “hardship” is subjective &amp; I probably have a healthier relationship to writing than I do directing. I feel most truly &amp; fully myself when directing - but I wouldn’t really say I enjoy it. I’m complicated.
@FR5DDY For sure
Good writers may be more rare than good directors. But directing, in general, is more exhausting both physically &amp; mentally. What sucks about screenwriting is eventually the form belongs to someone else (the director). What sucks about directing is it can be hell on earth. https://t.co/FUETflbW8C
@TimHanan @scottderrickson If you mean good writers are more rare than good directors - yes that very well might be true.
@im2b @scottderrickson I honestly believe I have the greatest and kindest cast with the GotG films of any cast ever. I have been remarkably blessed. But directing is still, for me, much harder than writing. I am exhausted beyond belief by the end of a film.

@Just_Parth @scottderrickson Yes
I do not agree, @scottderrickson. If only because I can wake up whenever I want to when writing.   (But overall I really think directing is the more difficult because of the stress. There’s a reason the average DGA member lives a much shorter life than the average person.) https://t.co/G1uKlrXBug

@Just_Parth @SwingLeft2018 @GiveEmHelenTai Maybe, maybe not - but Trump won in large part due to the demonization of HRC. And so far the Blue Wave is real, with an average swing across the board of over ten points in favor of the Dems.
@dmarlow2323 @Franklin_Graham But many people are upset with what Trump did because he misappropriated campaign funds to do it.
@dmarlow2323 @Franklin_Graham Well for the record this post is because Graham says in one instance it’s okay and another it is not. It’s hypocritical.
Giuliani numbing us to the outrage over the President of the United States pleading the Fifth, so when it actually happens they can all be like, “That?! We’ve already talked about that! It’s no big deal! We’re over that!”  But a President pleading the Fifth is a very big deal. https://t.co/SclbH0HfZZ
@dmarlow2323 @Franklin_Graham So you’re saying it matters if you cheat on your wife while one is actively President but NOT if he does it before he’s President?
I guess it’s only okay to cheat on your wife if it’s with two women simultaneously after she just gave birth, huh, @Franklin_Graham?   You are no moral authority, sir - nor a representative of God - merely a self-serving hypocrite with an incredibly short memory. https://t.co/cflxrwXZPt

@UzairJDK Oh he understands Groot. That’s just not how he knows it.
@DannyZuker He seems to mean that Dallas IS Texas.
I will gladly personally capital punishment this P.O.S. vet. 😡 https://t.co/uzx7TBpxck
@ScarletNatsuno That Thor took Groot as an elective.
@DeyAndNight No haha
@PirataWalker @MarvelStudios Yes I have
@bigjohn I was responding to a question about how it IS in the first Guardians.
For the record, Thor was making a joke. The way one learns Groot is a bit different than that. https://t.co/piO9lh4TaT
@SuperheroPOLL Hahaha every couple months we have translator and Groot conversations.
@JBGoodbody Because they are just that good.
@marvesaty Well I write his actual dialogue in the scripts so I guess so.
@astype Many many aliens have visited earth over the years.
@xoavry Almost all scripted in GotG vols 1 &amp; 2.
@Flrsi That’s his mask.
@TheWoogMan NASA scientists estimate there are billions of planets in our universe with an atmosphere similar to earth’s.
@Tronaker That’s what I just explained. Because he has a translator?
@xoavry In GotG or IW?
Many languages are NOT in the translators - and this includes Groot’s language. https://t.co/GKtac7i72v
Long time followers know the answer to this: They ALL have translators implanted, as do almost all space-faring aliens - it’s as common as cell phones to us (and they work both ways, meaning they can understand others and be understood). https://t.co/sx1PUfSx3G
@vestigiousvege1 @MeLStrong1 That’s one of the very many various stories that have been given. But you’d have to be very gullible to believe that. You may like the man’s policies but you don’t have to completely let go of rational thinking around everything he does. And I appreciate that, thanks.
@vestigiousvege1 @MeLStrong1 He was aware of the violation &amp; is now lying about it - that’s the point. He paid the money. This is a man who has a hard time getting a lawyer because he doesn’t pay his debts. You’d have to be completely foolish to believe he didn’t know the purpose of the money he gave Cohen.
@vestigiousvege1 @MeLStrong1 Giuliani this morning said the reason for the payoff was that it was about to come out right before the election. The purpose has been obvious and stated - that makes it a campaign violation.
@HaleysTusk (No it does not).
@FatGuysMovies Because he doesn’t want to go to prison is one of the reasons.
@lazykelley @Cakes_Comics Happy Birthday!!
@ChuckKC81 I chose the song for the movie, yes.
@vestigiousvege1 @MeLStrong1 In addition, the lie is NOT about his sex life, it’s about how campaign contributions have been used illegally. Secondly: https://t.co/vHZamaTFSs
@astype As I have said many times, the translators work both ways just as primitive translators do now on earth.
@vestigiousvege1 @MeLStrong1 I definitely do not lie every day. And I have never lied to the public.
@yoga__h They CGI’d Trump saying one thing and then lying and saying another?
@earlsaintclair Thanks man
Thanks to the dude today at the airport in Atlanta who brought stuff for me to sign but also thoughtfully picked up the 1st issue of the new @jasonaaron run on Avengers for me to read on the plane - a comic which I’ve been dying to dig into. Presents at the airport! @Marvel https://t.co/cGNcPa3U0X
@TheGingerNugget Anyone with a half a brain who’s been listening to him go on about a “witch hunt” and “no collusion.”
@marpiuze No need to call the police. But there IS a need for everyone with half a brain to realize the cries of “no collusion” and everything else he says means nothing.
Trump FLAT OUT said on Air Force One, “No, no,” when asked: "Mr. President did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?" He has the audacity to spout “Fake news” when his words mean nothing &amp; he has zero allegiance to the truth. https://t.co/OuZoHJ13LK

Girl Scout cookies bring in around $700 million a year &amp; Boy Scouts popcorn tastes like shit. This has a lot more to do with increasing membership in Scouts BSA than "political correctness." So please stop with the outrage &amp; pretending this is about anything besides money.
@TH0MSW I support capitalism. I don't think of this as a lowering of standards, it's just a different set of rules.
@eckomachine @ChrisWr19425027 Possible, but it has a pretty good shot at increasing their coffers.
@MichaelGunn68 I hear that. My Mom was a Girl Scout leader and my sister a scout for many years. They always seemed like an awesome organization.
@Deipax_13 You could be talking about either side here and I have no idea which. This exists on both sides.
@Deplorable_God The Girl Scouts are still the Girl Scouts - they are doing fine. The Boy Scouts are allowing in the other half of the population so that they can hopefully have more members and allow the organization to continue.
@RobACrawfish So you're saying one independent group that decided to change its rules for its own purposes should force another independent group to change its rules as well? You REALLY don't understand capitalism.
@Deplorable_God They don't sell cookies, and their membership is falling at a MUCH quicker rate.
@ChrisWr19425027 The Boy Scouts are trying to make more money. That's it. The Girl Scouts make money as is because they have a good cookie thing going. They're separate organizations - I'm not sure what one has to do with the other.
@IceKareemy Kinda neither.
Yes, the Boy Scouts have fallen to the liberal insanity of trying to be financially responsible and avoid bankruptcy by increasing their membership. WILL THE MADNESS NEVER STOP!? https://t.co/wlP5TxypRm

@fivefifths @markhughesfilms @ProfessorShyguy @iamgeek32 @McKelvie @JamesTheFourth Then you are saying identical twins - who are clones of each other - are the same person. And I’ve never even said young Groot was a clone.
@LawofCinema @Saurocron @MarvelNewz KYLE IS ALWAYS CORRECT.
@ProfessorShyguy @iamgeek32 @McKelvie @JamesTheFourth It’s simply a form of denial because they don’t want to admit original Groot has died - which I get.

@DylanFMackinnon @kumailn @maggieNYT That is true. So even more lame.
@kumailn @maggieNYT That's lame. For my money, making fun of someone's eyeshadow choice isn't making fun of someone's appearance.
Oh my gosh. Now it looks like #InfinityWar is beating Force Awakens for the biggest opening of all time - $250 million US and $630 million worldwide (WITHOUT China)!  😳😳😳😳🔥🧠🔥
@matthew82 @NewYorker Dude. You're talking about the NEW YORKER, not some twitter poster in New Mexico with three followers.
@scaryfriar @NewYorker "Is he spunky? He seems like he might be spunky. But I'm not sure if he's spunky or not. I need some kind of set up to show he's spunky, because I didn't watch the other four hours of film where his personality was established. Maybe he's not spunky? Who knows? I'm lost."
@darphsabean Being different from the source material is not retconning.
@MikeClemente1 @NewYorker It functions as a series of films, as everyone who watches and enjoys these films knows. It's an obvious context that this particular pull quote seems ignorant about, which is why it's definitely not legit.
@matthew82 @NewYorker So is mine, which you are also free to agree with or not.
“In Game of Thrones Season 8, the characters aren’t introduced, they just show up.”  Really, @NewYorker? I love you guys, but it’s as if you have no clue about how modern film-going audiences are experiencing movies. https://t.co/qHrXqiinI7

@ValerioSchiavi RESPONSE TO SPOILER QUESTION. I was a part of all of those choices for the Guardians. They all were okayed by me or, in some places, I asked for changes to things that were then changed - and the relationship stuff was one of those things. So that IS my choices.
@SirBenKenobi I think you misunderstand the numbers. Front-loaded films relying on marketing do best on Thursday &amp; Friday, taper on Saturday, and taper more on Sunday. Most enormous movies do this. Not IW - which is getting more each successive day because of word of mouth.
@Farman_Bond007 🤞🏻
What’s most exciting about this is day after day the movie is far exceeding expectations set by the preceding day, which means people are loving the movie and spreading the word.
Holy crap. Right now #AvengersInfinityWar is estimated to make $247.1 million this weekend. The biggest US opening EVER was Force Awakens at $247.9 million! Yesterday #InfinityWar had the biggest Saturday of all time with over $80 million. Incredible.

Because I keep getting asked this (and I'm sure it will continue for years): Yes, I suggested three songs to the @Russo_Brothers for the introductory scene for the @Guardians in #InfinityWar and this was the one that worked best for them. And, yes, it's on the Zune. https://t.co/9q2eXjAnbq

@kcxviii I’m not. I’m admonishing the hypocrisy of the leader of our country who leaked classified intelligence directly to the leaders of a country who are attacking us, which is far, far worse.
Comey leaked unclassified info to the press, whereas President Trump leaked classified intelligence to Russian officials AFTER learning from US intelligence Russia had cyber attacked our infrastructure and elections. This tweet is jaw-droppingly goofy and outlandish. https://t.co/o8VAvcXNay

@mcfreakit The audiences liked the films - they tested high, especially the second one. The critics didn't like them so much. I didn't direct them, so I only had so much control over the final product. The movies allowed me to keep working in the film industry!
@mcfreakit I loved SD as a kid, and they offered me the job to write it! I was excited about it. I thought it had a good chance of becoming a movie, which many screenplays don't. It impacted the industry in that they made a lot of films LIKE it afterwards (Garfield, Marmaduke, etc)
@SPJ112573 We might need to call it off if Steve isn't in. Sorry.
@BrianLynch Perhaps small jokes that only take up, say, the lower one 16th right side of the frame? Do you think we could do that?
@BrianLynch Dude believe me I’ve learned my lesson. Jokes belong in movies, not in life.
You are so right. All of us in the world need to quit making jokes forever. Because when you make a joke about a subject it obviously follows that you think people shouldn’t be allowed to have a different opinion on that same subject. Thanks for this life-lesson on logic! 🙏 https://t.co/LIBIjslc4B

@redleger @BeardedGenius The point of the tweets is Melania is America in those two tweets: horrified by Donald Trump and much happier with Obama.
@redleger @BeardedGenius Also I love how Jimmy Kimmel doing an imitation for two seconds becomes “the left just making fun of her accent unapologeticcally.” I don’t even know how to respond to this pretzel-twisted logic anymore.
@redleger @BeardedGenius Honestly? This is a real question? You think these posts mean Melania represents America as a whole? 😐

So many of my @MarvelStudios brothers &amp; sisters are at the #InfinityWar premiere tonight; I can’t be there because I’m filming, but I’m with them in spirit. I am incredibly fortunate to have so many wonderful people around me in my daily work life. ❤️
@michelemorrow I would love to do that.
So weird. I can’t imagine why Trump would have lied and said he didn’t spend the night there. https://t.co/R33sRu11Wm
@vestigiousvege1 No. But calling for a boycott and gleefully tweeting about their lower ratings is.
@Gamblers717 A) He’s the freaking President of the United States. One of his jobs is to facilitate the economy. B) If Ingraham’s show is canceled it’s replaced by another - an equal amount of jobs. It’s not an overall loss as it is with the NFL. C) Do I really have to explain all this?

@Gamblers717 And no one, not even “libs,” would deny they’ve tried to take down, say, Laura Ingraham.
@Gamblers717 He called for boycotts and gleefully tweeted about lowered ratings (i.e. failing business). You can interpret that how you want. Most would call that trying to take down the NFL.
I thought of this every time Trump tried to destroy the NFL with his tweets - an enormous business which employs nearly as many people as the coal industry, and our President was actively trying to take it down (not to mention Amazon). https://t.co/28j1Dj0K1p

And you guys did it!! @RainforestTrust, the money will be on its way tomorrow morning!! Thanks everyone - and give a little bit to Rainforest Trust if you can. On average, an acre of land is just a couple bucks - so even a small donation makes a huge difference. #EarthDay https://t.co/W6oEoT58qK
@Stopper206 @RainforestTrust Wrong. Around a thousand acres. And I’ve bought many tens of thousands of acres of land through RT over the years.
@Jons_a_Pedo @JonRisinger @RainforestTrust That does not work, and it would not get 10k retweets. Again, seems obvious and simple to me.
@alanlmatthews This is a new and different recording of him pretending to be the same guy. The other tape has him talkin about what a ladies’ man he is.

@sujewafantastic @RainforestTrust 🤞🏻
@Jons_a_Pedo @JonRisinger @RainforestTrust How does that help promote Rainforest Trust?
@jpalmiotti I definitely don’t blame anyone for charging, whether it’s a lot or a little, whether they need it or they don’t - as long as they treat people with respect. By far most do.
@jpalmiotti I know a lot of folks who love meeting the fans, but it is grueling signing for hour after hour, so the general rule applies that applies to directors, writers, artists etc - you get what you can. (That said, I rarely sign but when I do I don’t charge).
@ZachAResearch @KurtSchlichter Fuuuuuuck. Good point.
@failingConman Or even just delete the tweet and ignore it. Instead he somehow tries to make everyone else wrong.
@failingConman He didn’t tell the truth. He made a false statement and I corrected him.
@KurtSchlichter Dear Butthurt Kurt - I corrected you on a factual error in your tweet (you called someone the founder of Earth Day who was not). Instead of admitting your mistake, like an adult would, you took the coward’s route &amp; changed the subject and shifted blame. That is lack of character.
This was this loser’s response to being corrected about a factual error he tweeted. https://t.co/LqpsXpd3oG
@MrDonFrances @KurtSchlichter It doesn’t matter if the guy was the biggest supporter of Earth Day ever. That isn’t what I corrected. But Butthurt Kurt is one of these spineless dudes incapable of having admitted he made a mistake - so he brings up some other, irrelevant fact instead.
@KurtSchlichter You said he was the founder of Earth Day. I pointed out that he wasn’t. Grow some balls, have at least some integrity, and admit your mistake.
@AffinPub @Bail_Bondsman @mfoster42o @RainforestTrust I do haha. I promise my goal is not to make the planet inhabitable.
@KurtSchlichter And you keep celebrating by tweeting obvious falsehoods without taking responsibility for it when called out. Your character is apparent.
@Bail_Bondsman @mfoster42o @RainforestTrust I don’t really believe that. But I do believe it’s worthy of respect and I want it to be inhabitable for future generations, so it’s worth taking care of.
Except... that’s not true. Google is your friend. https://t.co/6TQRd7V0ho https://t.co/8vV8N2eXNt
@PeoplePower422 @RainforestTrust That’s not true. And a simple Google search would have let you know it wasn’t. https://t.co/6TQRd7V0ho
@mfoster42o @RainforestTrust It did
There are many ways to support the planet on #EarthDay. One of the best is to support @RainforestTrust, who buy up acres of land, protecting wildlife and plant life for future generations. Today I’ll give them a dollar for every retweet of this tweet up to $10,000.
@Marvel_Thalia Ignore the needy dude.

Kellyanne Conway’s husband has repeatedly tweeted that Trump is corrupt and incompetent. It is absolutely relevant that she is asked about this, as it’s possible it comes from inside information (and of course it would be asked of her if she was a man). https://t.co/r7dJti91kh
@colliderfrosty I’m definitely asking you who this was the next time I see you.
@matthewmercer @JoeManganiello Absolutely!
@nat20selfcrit @theyearofelan I don’t agree to that at all.
@steveagee Oh. You’re still alive. Unexpected.
And when Trump sued an author for claiming he wasn’t a billionaire, he couldn’t prove in a court of law that he was. The billionaires I know laugh when people call Trump a billionaire. He’s a complete failure as a businessman. https://t.co/ucxPChWewr

@TheEricGoldman Yes it’s really fun
@WildGues @scottderrickson I’m interested in how you interpret the phrase “a lot.”
@theyearofelan If only you weren’t a milk bigot you’d be a great friend.
@scottderrickson You’d think the death camps were on the way.
@theyearofelan @MrJonCryer I really think it’s a matter of balance. Believing in luck, recognizing when you’re blessed, but never relying on luck seems a healthy way to go.
@MGMcKendrick Maybe it would (but there are a LOT of successful narcissists)! I’M a person of faith but I believe, if I’ve been blessed with gifts, it’s up to me to utilize them, luck be damned. It’s very much a balance - at least as far as I’m concerned.
@TrumpsVoidHead @chriostoir_g Trump is the most talented blusterer in the history of the world (for real).
@theyearofelan Simply, looking at luck retroactively as responsible for one’s success is changing one’s worldview in a way that could negatively affect future endeavors.
@AlanS67420146 Absolutely. And a lot of luck is in inmate ability. That can’t be argued with. AND success is relative.
@deplorkibble That isn’t what I said, but a bitter, negative attitude MIGHT have something to do with a lack of success. Just food for thought.
@MrTedLouis A little. But mostly it just doesn’t play a huge factor in most people’s lives over the long run. A much bigger factor is one taking responsibility for his or her own life.
@MGMcKendrick Except that’s not what the data supports - the evidence is very very clear that a much larger proportion of people who believe they are responsible for their own fates are successful than those who don’t.
@sarahcpr 100% agree.
If you ask me what I believe, of course luck exists in the moment &amp; some people get extraordinarily lucky big breaks - but, normally, over the course of a lifetime, luck evens out - that’s just probability at work - &amp; a person’s choices &amp; work ethic are more important than luck.
In other words, whether luck is partially responsible for success or not, believing it doesn’t exist helps a person to become more successful because they work harder, take responsibility for their failures, and create more opportunities for luck to exist.
There is an easy answer to this: believing one has control over one’s own fate &amp; a disbelief in luck is one of the two traits successful people most likely share (the other is the ability to delay gratification) - and they share those traits both before and after success arrives. https://t.co/j34sBB5zwl

@madcapzest @mad_kenobi Yes. Of course. And your average American barely knows who Steven Spielberg is or what he does. Again, relatively speaking, any position that gets an Oscar is valued in comparison to say, 1st AD, who is never known and gets no awards for his or her enormous contribution.
@mad_kenobi There are many relatively famous film editors (Thelma Schoonmakee, Walter Murch). And they get their own awards and Oscars and magazines, etc.

Scripties are undervalued - lots of pressure &amp; they work hard. But to me Focus Puller &amp; the 1st AD have the most pressure on them &amp; 1st ADs put in perhaps the most actual time working on set.

@kumailn I love gluten’s interviews.
@theyearofelan I hope you saw how my poll destroyed your pee argument.
Once again, lots of tweets condemning Amazon, Bezos, and the Washington Post, who report negative news on Trump, and not a single tweet ever condemning Putin, who’s throwing the world into turmoil. Trump will always put personal interests over American interests. https://t.co/5SBvyQYLcB
@Sarah_White_77 You’re welcome
@speedingahead You really don’t.
@StydiaSteph Enjoy
@_JDtweets And sober. Love the Twitter handle. Keep it up.
Get this straight. The sexual abuse of children is an incredibly important issue. It’s something that’s affected my own life and the lives of many people I care about. Nothing gets me more pissed off. But YOU enable the problem by intermingling it with this #Qanon fantasy. https://t.co/6ZjcVSDRd6
@kathleengmaz I never excused anyone from anything. But I do believe in being compassionate with those who are mentally or emotionally suffering.
@douglaskoke I don’t even understand what that has to do with art and entertainment. But if someone is delusional that would affect how we process their opinions on culture and politics.
@douglaskoke When in the world did I say anything like that?
@the_jannis Okay - it’s not my profession it’s just my degree. I became a filmmaker instead. As a nonprofessional, I don’t think you KNOW what someone else is experiencing, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t make an educated guess with the tools available.
@kathleengmaz Unless you have her specific illness, you absolutely cannot. Some mental illnesses affect all of your choices and thoughts. You don’t maintain control over what you want to maintain control of.
@kathleengmaz It’s really hard to say what you’d do if you had a serious mental disorder - because having a serious mental disorder could very possibly impair your ability to make such decisions.
@the_jannis As someone with a degree in psychology, I don’t believe it’s that subjective.
@CrazyClown124 I am baffled as to what this has to do with what I tweeted.
@notthebadplace Yeah I think we need to be aware of this.
@rlowenbvt Ahhh! Got it.
@the_jannis And I’m certainly not meaning to offend you here in any way.
@the_jannis Most psychologists don’t believe MPD is a real disorder. So there’s that. And, if it does, wouldn’t it, by its very nature (creating different identities to protect the self - of people who don’t actually exist), mean that critical thinking IS impaired?
@PiercedTedyBear @steveagee One exception.
@steveagee That was the point.
@NestleUSA @Tuxedocat83 Thanks!!!
@l3gend_the It was confirmed that the 60 diplomats could be replaced by 60 other diplomats by the Russians, meaning - and there’s nothing hypothetical about it - that it is not a real punishment of any sort. And that’s your 3rd strike, friend. I’m done here.
@l3gend_the You do realize this has been confirmed by the State Department, right? (Just kidding, I know you don’t.) So what’s your next attempt to rationalize it?
@Siriusjay @BECrim71 @erniecline @rmlimodriver69 I would have replaced the Iron Giant with an enormous Flat Ronnie.
@entitled2life Of course
@l3gend_the Other countries expelled Russian diplomats &amp; DIDN’T ALLOW THEM TO JUST BE REPLACED BY OTHER DIPLOMATS. They truly kicked them out of the country. What Trump did is essentially the same as doing nothing - while trying to trick the American people into thinking he’s doing something
@keithgregory16 It’s been confirmed by the State Department.
@l3gend_the I’m not liberal. Just a guy who doesn’t like a President who’s a traitor (&amp; the LEAST fiscally conservative Pres ever). There’s no pleasing me in the situation because he’s trying to make it look as if he’s expelling Russians &amp; he ISN’T. This is of no harm to Russia whatsoever.
In other words, Trump’s “expulsion” of 60 Russian diplomats is a bullshit shell game to convince US citizens he’s doing something harmful to Russia while he’s actually still in Putin’s pocket. https://t.co/gDH0XnRDY6

Important: My foolish friend @theyearofelan &amp; I have different ideas on the human body. He says sometimes you need to pee &amp; the need goes away &amp; comes back later. I say only the need to poo goes away &amp; comes back - once you need to pee, it never leaves. What’s the truth?

I’m really looking forward to season two of Handmaid’s Tale so I hope @hulu stops advertising on the Aunt Lydia show - uh, I mean, on the Laura Ingraham show, so I can watch it. Online bullying &amp; shaming of teenagers should not be supported by Hulu. Let them know.
@ManMadeMoon @IngrahamAngle @ATT @Bayer @Arbys @Nestle @hulu Especially you, @hulu. I and others who have provided content for you guys believe you’ll do the right thing here. Thank you ahead of time.
I stand with @davidhogg111. It’s acceptable to disagree with his politics. It’s another to resort to online bullying and shaming of kids who, agree with them or not, are trying their best to make this world a better place, as @IngrahamAngle has done. Let the advertisers know. https://t.co/OshTEFKwKc
@davidhogg111 @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @Bayer @RocketMortgage @LibertyMutual @Arbys @TripAdvisor @Nestle @hulu @Wayfair We’ve got your back. If these companies are okay with online bullying and shaming of teenagers trying to make the world a better place - whether or not one agrees with them - they should continue to advertise on @IngrahamAngle. And, if so, we will boycott.

@DanaSchwartzzz Physically I don’t think he could do what Sean does. So it would be a futile exercise.
@DraftShowOG @shannonwoodward His rad speaking abilities weren’t worth the millions of people he murdered.
@jeannius I mean the assumption is they would lie.
@iche_me Yes for sure.
@sailordeath Not Russia. But North Korea - maybe.
@kaboom43 By dangling pardons if people keep their mouths shut, the assumption would be they would keep their mouths shut.
@jeannius That is true - if these were people playing by the rules. In this case, however, it seems the pardons are being dangled as a gift for keeping their mouths shut.
Whether or not this is legally obstruction, it is most definitely ethically obstruction. Trump is deathly afraid of Mueller finding evidence of his own illegal conduct, and is willing to do anything to stop it. There is no other reason to broach the subject of pardons so early. https://t.co/6qQNoRENph

@AnGelMan2 @phil_addison04 Not sure what that has to do with casting a film.
@benfraley I’m not that cool.
In Hollywood, when you go out with a script, it’s normal to get passed on a couple times by actors before you find the right person for the role. But if you keep getting passed on, again and again, eventually you have to ask yourself - Maybe the script sucks?
@benfraley Let’s subtly encourage him by all of us tweeting at him at the same time that he’s not smart enough to represent himself.

Cambridge Analytica tested the concept of “the Deep State” &amp; found out folks loved it, as they often love to have an imaginary enemy to blame for their problems. So ironic how often the right-wing claims the left is “victim culture,” when the current White House is built on it.

@DeltaCanuckian I’m being careful.
At this point there’s a 40% chance Putin has video of Trump having sex with a blonde Russian prostitute he calls “Ivanka.”
@Dlanderson1977 Thanks.
@TylerHuckabee @jenwined (Not you, Tyler).
@TylerHuckabee @jenwined You’re clueless. It’s happening because Wall Street Journal broke the story and she’s had to deal with the wake.
@Dlanderson1977 You’re correct that it’s not easy. But it’s significantly easier than what SD’s kid is going through now.
@DamianSylvia1 Your brain that loves Trump so much is the same one that mistakes “right” for “write.” Consider you’re as utterly clueless with politics as you are with spelling.
@TylerHuckabee @jenwined She came up and physically threatened herself in front of her child?
@Dlanderson1977 You’re definitely wrong. I’ve had friends who are porn stars. They are rarely recognized. Right now Stormy Daniels is one of the most famous people in the world and she’s being badgered by Trumpies.
@Dlanderson1977 You’d be guessing wrong. Also guessing dumb.
Lots of Stormy Daniels jokes over the last few months, but seeing her talking about how difficult this has been for her child is heartbreaking.

@Slippery_Sloper “Everyday American” is commonly considered synonymous with “your average American,” which is clearly NOT an NRA member. 5 million people are on the fringe of the 325 who live in the U.S. And God only knows what you’re trying to say in the rest of this tweet.
@MJMcKean He’s awesome.
@cmcuffman @paddy_omalley True BUT Fox News polls are notoriously slanted.
@paddy_omalley Absolutely 100% false that this is in line with what the NRA proposes.

Trump calling the Mueller probe a “witch hunt” &amp; then signing sanctions against the 19 Russians Mueller indicted is one of my favorites.

@Mmount378 @gordongurley It’s not a lie it’s a joke, dumbass. Muting.
@NRATV @KillerMike “I told my kids I’ll abandon you if you disagree with me.” Got it. The NRA’s usual blend of illogic and indifference to the lives of children.
@gordongurley That’s because Rubio gets 98% of his funds from the NRA.
I know you’re desperate to frame the discussion so it serves your base &amp; your masters in the NRA, but it’s obviously “gun reform” NOT “gun ban” - something by far the vast majority of Americans are in favor of, but you continue to govern by the few for the few. #March4OurLives https://t.co/kO85pVcUuw

There have been many wonderful dicks attached to very terrible men. So if this was the case we would concede &amp; move on.

@kevinwhinnery No doubt. I thought the same thing! Some of those cover-ups should be weighted!
As our constitution is attacked &amp; Trump’s personal interests outweigh his oath to protect our nation, many of our Reps have enabled him, time &amp; again. The #CoverUpCaucus site shows you if your rep is among them and, if so, what YOU can do to stop them. RT. https://t.co/nZhwGH9ka3
@WatchChad @BeernBrownsGuy @LisaSeaFL @BobEstesPGA No one expects gun reform to stop people from murdering people with guns - just cut down on the amount of people getting killed.

@nytopinion 👍
Absolutely. To run for President someone must absolutely at least be able to get a full security clearance. Knowing what we know now it is almost certain that Donald Trump, like his son-in-law and daughter, would be unable to pass this simple test. https://t.co/X3QTNPU2je
@saradannerdukic Thank you for this.
@rdone It really seems that way, doesn't it.
This would go a lot further than crying "No collusion" to make Americans feel comfortable and maybe start to believe our President has our backs over the back of his-seemingly-pal Putin. 5) Don't do none of this and, instead, congratulate Putin on his false victory.
4) Trump himself needs to publicly acknowledge, in a strong but not unhinged way, Putin &amp; Russia's transgressions - the election interference, the cyber-attacks on our power grid, the video threats of blowing up Florida, &amp; the assassination of our allies on allied soil.
3) Actually spend the $120 million earmarked for fighting cyberattacks upon our election systems, of which Trump and his team have refused to spend ONE DOLLAR. (Likewise, since our elections were attacked, it'd be nice to have at least one cabinet meeting discussing this.)
2) Impose harsher sanctions, not against the Russian people, but that directly and negatively affect the fortunes of Putin and the oligarchs, as outlined by anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny (@navalny).
Of course not. War isn't the answer. But here are a few, simple things Trump SHOULD do in regards to Russia: 1) Impose ALL the sanctions authorized by the House in a bipartisan agreement that HE signed into law but is still, illegally, refusing to impose. (THREAD) https://t.co/x0uI1OoBoB
@garciamanuel77 No
@luqven @Aaropostale That's not the tweet you were responding to, Einstein. I call them attacks, as in "cyber attacks", a term used by Homeland Security. They also poisoned that double agent's daughter. Does @PanAmPost pay you to troll? Glad they have great representatives like you out there. 👍
@rrw315 @JaysonWSmith @RealDonalDrumpf Ah.
@SuperBuilta Impeach Trump. Live with Pence for two years. He's a lame duck President, but probably not a traitor, and we'll all be safer.
Also note, Trump proclaims the Russian investigation is a "witch hunt" WHILE simultaneously imposing sanctions against the individuals Mueller uncovered in his probe &amp; has indicted. That alone acknowledges Mueller has provided our country a great service &amp; it's no witch hunt.
These are not the bipartisan sanctions Trump agreed to impose, &amp; is legally required by law to impose, but won't. They're sanctions burning Russian operatives that Mueller has already burnt. It's a way for Trump to say "I imposed sanctions!" while really doing nearly nothing.
@RamziKarim They aren't. They're likely working for Putin, but they've already been busted.
@Diana_Puertas Yes, I tweeted about it yesterday.
For Trumpies tweeting me Trump IS hard on Russia &amp; just imposed Russian sanctions - think again. The sanctions are only against a handful of individuals &amp; entities, most of them the folks indicted by Mueller. It's a way to avoid actually harming Putin.  https://t.co/dYqDKB0Ibb
@hopson3233 @djonzey64 It was a joke.
@JaysonWSmith @rrw315 @RealDonalDrumpf Who else could you have been referring to?
@MrBenlight Now imagine those sanctions are only against a handful of people, most of whom are already indicted by Mueller. It's like you post articles you don't even read.
@luqven @Aaropostale Yes, the opinions espoused in the original tweet - that Russia attacked our power grid and killed U.K. citizens - announcements made, respectively, by Homeland Security and the White House in conjunction with the international community - are so “tinfoil-hat.”
@luqven It only makes sense to me and then everyone else in the world who has an iota of knowledge of what’s going on in the news.
Now imagine how upset he would have been if Chavez had attacked our country and killed our allies. Trump’s hypocrisy knows no bounds. https://t.co/UV3ojvbieT
@JaysonWSmith @rrw315 @RealDonalDrumpf Always nice to hear someone is professional - thanks for the insight.
How does anyone believe his ludicrous cries of "NO COLLUSION" any longer? Donald Trump is a traitor to our country who should be subject to the harshest punishment available. And anyone who continues to support him in the GOP needs to be held accountable. https://t.co/iCMb5l8IQn
@rachelmack @rrw315 That is very true.
@AMF6686 No one who knows anything about acting would ever agree with you in a million years. There’s a reason me &amp; other A list directors keep hiring DB. I’m not saying you’re a stupid person - you’re probably very intelligent - but you really, truly don’t understand acting in the least.
The GOP have allowed AN ACTUAL FUCKING NAZI as their Congressional Nominee. It is stuff like this why, although I don’t agree with the Democrats on everything, I’m voting straight blue. The two parties are not the same. #BlueWave https://t.co/TAz4qGuoiM
@AMF6686 The guy who many of the trades said deserved a Best Supporting Actor nom? Who tested as the most popular character in the movie? Damn fucking straight I did. He’s a great actor and you know shit about acting if you think otherwise.

@AtomicFonz No doubt. Many intelligent conservatives detached from Trump a long time ago.
I always love it when people outside my industry lecture me on my industry. Some of the biggest actors &amp; players in Hollywood are conservative Republicans &amp; quite a few are close friends. And I've never once seen them bullied. Note: By now most of them realize Trump's an idiot. https://t.co/Wn5WelECM4
@Artifex_Prime I think we need to be getting out the vote and voting blue across the board. It's the most simple way to get the most corrupt people, like Trump and those around him and those who cater to him, out of office.
@contentwh0re I think it's difficult for her to accept the money &amp; then say she wants to tell her story. That said, I also think the hush money is likely an illegal campaign contribution, so that's a completely different problem. And there are contractual difficulties upholding it as well.
@K8Met Below this comment you can treat yourself to a bot-versation. 😂 Any way to make a living, I guess! https://t.co/5ii6ELGvTV
@VinTheMang I was pretty pissed off about that, yeah. But I pretty much stayed quiet about the Stormy Daniels stuff before it became a likely illegal campaign donation.
@shaunlabrie That's a bot (or, more accurately, sock puppet). Ignore.
@K8Met That's a bot (or, more accurately, sock puppet). Ignore.
In other words, McDougal clearly thought her story was getting out there, and the Enquirer tried to legally trick her and block it to help Trump. It's significantly different than Daniels taking money from Trump (oh, wait, I mean from his altruistic lawyer!) to keep quiet.
For those not following the Trump sex/pay-off scandals, the Karen McDougal story is a lot different from the Stormy Daniels' one. The Enquirer - friends of Trump - paid McDougal for her story &amp; made her sign an exclusive NDA with them &amp; then NEVER RAN THE STORY. Clear chicanery.

@patrickfwhitman @Turcicus7 There is an enormous and obvious difference between practical diplomacy to keep the world at peace and obliviousness and collusion in the face of publicly known attacks (not to mention Russian State TV declaring they “own” Trump). This is not rocket science.
@Turcicus7 @patrickfwhitman Yes. As I said in both tweets I tweeted.
@patrickfwhitman Dude. Give me a break. At some point there must be some small part of yourself that realizes the ludicrous contortions of logic you’re going through to rationalize your support of a traitor.
@TeddyBluegrass 😐
@HeyItsMeLP Let’s hope.
@scottgal You know what I mean.
Today the last Northern White Rhino died in captivity after the rest of its entire species was poached into non-existence. Meanwhile, President Trump has just made it legal to import hunted elephant “trophies” into the U.S. What animal will be next? https://t.co/dyh9GDohi5
@Jayphex303 @BeerMeKennyP @Relentl3ss @OlPejeta The species was poached into non-existence. Pretty simple.
@patrickfwhitman First of all, I don’t give a fuck about Obama. Secondly, that has nothing to do with what I just tweeted about Trump doing so after Homeland Security announced they attacked us and they killed our allies. Perfect example of someone seeing only what they want to see.
@Dwinkleblumbs They weren’t in the comic, but they were in my original concept of the translation to film.
Trump congratulates Putin, a foreign dictator, for winning a fraudulent election, DAYS after Homeland Security announced Russia is currently attacking US power grids. For those of you who still believe “No collusion”, I have a Flat Earth &amp; a Faked Moon Landing I want to sell you.
The 5th bombing this week in an incredible onslaught of domestic terrorism. And yet the President says NOTHING, preferring to whine endlessly about his own victimization instead. https://t.co/QqfPKNQMzU

@lifeb4man Thank you for being awesome.
@lifeb4man I hear you. I certainly don’t mean to go off on you personally. But sitting on the sidelines right now it seems as if 90% of corruption is coming from ONE political party and the constant need to make it seem like it’s coming equally from both sides is obstructing positive change
There are a few very good people in politics. There are a lot that are somewhere in the middle. And then there are some truly awful eggs: the GOP right now has more than their fair share. And Team Trump is near or at 100%. And before you start - I’M NOT A LIBERAL. Just awake.
This rampant cynicism that NO politicians do what they do in service of others has permeated our culture just as rampant naive, gullibility did in the ‘50’s. Believing “they’re all the same” is PUSHED by Team Trump because it allows someone as noxious as Trump to become President
No all politicians do NOT do this. That’s what you’ll see the bots &amp; the Trumpies selling in light of this: might as well support Trump, because they’re all the same. But they aren’t. And most do NOT entrap their enemies or obstruct justice or collude with foreign entities. https://t.co/HaDylW75by
@TheChrisGlass Incredible isn’t it?!

@Living400lbs @MrNickCharles It wasn’t a rumor. NYT reported he met with Emmet T. Flood, who represented Clinton. They didn’t say he was hiring him but that he was “looking to shake up his legal team“ - which he obviously did. Trump responded with this tweet saying he wasn’t hiring another lawyer.
This was a week ago. Today the White House announced Trump has added another lawyer. The NYT once again proves most fake news is from Trump himself. https://t.co/60MxtNQQRH

@JimPetrozzi I've made many tens of of millions of dollars on my own. Why would I need to be subsidized by the DNC, and how could they possibly afford me, and why would it be worth it to them for my relatively measly number of followers on social networking platforms? Use your logic, dude.
@beatebaan @CinemarkChile Avengers 4 is 2019; Guardians is 2020.
@Captaintae I hope you’re joking. This is a BBC reporter undercover with a guy on video who is famous and the head of CA talking about entrapping politicians. I’m going to guess you didn’t actually watch it.
@Captaintae It's hard to call it a conspiracy "theory" when we have the perpetrators outlining exactly what they've done on film.
After watching this video, it's impossible not to wonder if this is why the GOP have so bafflingly stood behind Trump while he's obviously in hock to Putin. Has the Trump team used these entrapment techniques on the GOP? https://t.co/JXTMoMYPBX
Holy Crap. https://t.co/JXTMoMYPBX
@patrickfwhitman Hard to tell, but, no.
So Fox &amp; Friends is offended by Jim Carrey's caricature of Sarah Sanders, but isn't when Trump called Gail Collins a "dog", or when he said @Rosie has a "fat, ugly face" or said, when interviewed about women, "You need to treat them like shit." Got it.
I love the Russian people. I've had fabulous experiences with them, in Russia, around the world, and online - and I should communicate that more often. I am not a fan of your current government (nor mine). https://t.co/tvxFMzfmDF
@SonjhonMatthias Again, as I said above, I think it's a stretch that the Assad-related quotes are negative, and especially a stretch when you consider that's the worst thing Trump has ever said about a dictator who has attacked us and our allies. Willing to listen to other examples of "debunking"
@scorpio8675309 And, you have to admit, that's a pretty huge stretch for the worst thing to come out of Trump's mouth about a foreign dictator who has attacked us and our allies.
@scorpio8675309 Yes, the White House occasionally steers away from Trump but the words never come out of his mouth.
@scorpio8675309 I get your point, but I certainly don't think that's negative for someone who attacks so many others in such harsh ways on a daily basis - "Putin, I like you, but I don't like that you back Assad." But never calling him out for attacking our elections &amp; power grid, etc.
After locking up and banning his opposition, Putin still needed to cheat. And Trump STILL hasn’t said a negative word about him. Ever. https://t.co/aIfBTGnFeP
@DeepStateAgent2 That is because of your patterns of retweets. The programs are not perfect - they don't say you ARE a bot but that you have a 90% chance of being one. 90% of the time someone tweets like you, they're a bot. That IS helpful to people and shouldn't be casually dismissed.
@IdealGasLaw I DO still call those bots (trolls on troll farms, usually semi-moderated). But, yeah, they're worse or just as bad.
Absolutely not. Bots are automated programs setting forth extremist propaganda. They often support Trump. Sometimes they're semi-moderated by trolls in troll farms, so they actually communicate. Usually Russian in origin. They're not the same as real Americans tricked by them. https://t.co/obAOAzCeHS
@dbkimbro Aren't most trolls just exercising their free speech? If they're not threatening anyone I'm not sure they should be reported (blocked or muted, sure).
@artworkjames Or what about a troll in a bot farm and a left-wing woman fall in love after shouting at each other on the Internet?
@yellowfed Absolutely.
@Textworkers @realDonaldTrump You got it. I don't always succeed, but I try. Most people just want a better country.
@halladayfan32 You too!
Resisters: One of the common things to do today is to call Trumpies 'bots' whether they are or not. It diminishes calling out true bots, so let's stop.

@IdealGasLaw It's not a fake account according to my software. Are you just making up that you think it's a fake account?
@jp_in_nj Yes, I know, that's good. But they still attacked the power grid, which is the point of the tweet.
@cptnloco262 Incorrect. They DID attack the power grids. Whether they did or can do damage is the question. But they 100% did attack them.
@FANT0MEX @Discoexpress @realDonaldTrump Oh, they've been doing it for many years. And stories leaked out beforehand. But Homeland Security announcing it and warning that it's happening is definitely not old news.
@Bennyminusjets @cspan They think the homeland security announcement is fake news?
Meanwhile, Trump on the power grid attacks: Silent. Trump on the Austin bombings: Silent. Trump on his ass being in danger of going to jail: Will not shut the fuck up.
@soloparaeloins I always love hearing this.
Yes, how incredibly nutty of us, blaming Russia for attacking our power grid after Homeland Security announces that Russia attacked our power grid! The MSM is out of control! Where are our tinfoil hats?! https://t.co/PPFjyq5NC0
@TKMEDIA99 @realDonaldTrump The sanctions are complete, namby pamby bullshit. We need to hit Putin where it hurts - these ones don't hurt him at all.
@samueldcarrico @realDonaldTrump So A) More sanctions. B) We allow the $120 million dollars earmarked for fighting Russain cyberattacks - money Trump has been holding back! - to actually be spent. C) And then spend more. Pretty simple, and not war.
@samueldcarrico @realDonaldTrump Trump has imposed the very least of the sanctions he was forced to impose - there are a LOT more to do, especially ones that directly affect Putin &amp; the other oligarchs. If you think we've sanctioned the hell out of them, your news is insanely slanted. Just not true.
@Discoexpress @realDonaldTrump Um, the US declaring that it's happening on FRIDAY is old news?

For me, GotG Vol. 1 is about learning to love others and Vol. 2 is about learning to allow others to love you.

@realDonaldTrump Many, many, many words on twitter about how Mr. Mueller is attacking you. But zero words about how Russia attacked our power grid - we are under attack by a foreign country and you say NOTHING about it. If this is a witch hunt, you're one big-ass witch. https://t.co/5uHg7wrCBE

@realDonaldTrump Mueller has no conflicts of interest; his only interest is the law he’s been beholden to for almost his entire life. But, as is obvious to nearly everyone, you DO have a conflict of interest - your oath as President vs your personal interests - when you continuously attack him.

@DurinnMcfurren @jstick34 I live for imagining the different ways living beings and cultures could evolve.
@Killernato A tree man is DEFINITELY more plausible than the entire galaxy speaking English. I just have to travel two hours by car to go somewhere where almost no one speaks English on this planet.
@SebastianPiriz No, I created the jump point method of traveling through space for Guardians.
@jstick34 @DurinnMcfurren I've talked to NASA guys who think it's very likely life on other planets would most likely evolve in a bipedal manner and end up looking very similar to us. I go with that.
@DurinnMcfurren In Guardians, it does not work on languages not programmed in. That said, traveling millions of light years in hours is not significantly less far-fetched.
The Guardians &amp; most space-faring sort have translators imbedded that work both ways (i.e., the person you're communicating with doesn't need to also have a translator). If you think it's far fetched, we are almost there ourselves. It's a heck of a lot easier than space travel. https://t.co/P0jTIrKDrL

And, of course, Trump is also pro-the-torturing-of-puppies because, you know, being a traitor to Russia and an abuser of women just wasn't quite evil enough. https://t.co/XZmbUUcBZa
And don't forget Trump once again allowed elephant trophies to be imported, despite that the vast majority of Americans are against this. But his kids need more pics of themselves with dead elephant parts to jerk off to and that takes precedence over serving the American people.
On top of everything else, Trump's infinite cornucopia of scandals about him being a traitor to Russia and paying off porn stars distract from the fact that he's pro-cruelty-to-animals. https://t.co/aABlOI4VRY
@cinnabenroll I don't follow him, dumbshit.
@RepAdamSchiff It's important to note that this one Schiff tweet has more retweets than the dumbass Trump tweet it's referring to. I think that lets you know a little about the feelings of most American citizens.
@st_mulberry Yep
@The_Slavinator @seangunn @cinnabenroll We're talking about a President who tweeted video of "Muslim" kid beating up a kid on crutches. Only the kid wasn't even a Muslim. If you don't think that's the modern version of the propaganda films the Nazis made, you're blind.
AND Kushner still can't get a security clearance, AND he has abused his office in his relationship with foreign agents to assist his own business interests, etc, etc, ad nauseam, AND STILL he's in the White House. Oh, yeah, also, he's the President's son-in-law. #Oligarchy101 https://t.co/HPSCn1iErL
@alejandromoli24 The Guardians keep on trucking.
@deshain2 As I said Vol 3 is AFTER Avengers 4.
@S1cKWaRRioR No. And I never said he'd be in Vol. 3 either.
@officialsadat No.
@Ani31333803 Disney has not acquired Fox, so no.
@eodguy89d @chandleredward2 @johnmaddening @J_L_Walker @scottderrickson Well if you keep believing then you should do it, because, you know, never give up on your dreams.
@jetsjets @scottderrickson @JamieBearse @ScreenPhiles Same rules apply. Being a director is more competitive than being an actor - there are many, many fewer of us.
@JamieBearse @scottderrickson @ScreenPhiles No, no, that isn't what we said. We said the people who make it are BOTH naturals AND work at it. I do not think it's so much that they're provided opportunity, but that those who are not of certain races and genders are discouraged more from an early age.
@ogwaves It's for you, then.
@Yfz84 Yes, because then you will avoid making millions of dollars, meeting a lot of awesome friends, learning everything you need to know about making large budget movies, and be able to afford to move out of your shitty apartment. Good advice.
3 Finally, there are very few successful people who believe luck is overly important. People get lucky because they unstintingly create opportunity for themselves - again and again, they keep going where others stop, making it a statistical probability that they'll succeed.
2 Once you've found what you're good at that you also enjoy doing, follow it with all your heart and work your fingers to the bone in its pursuit. ALSO: It's good to listen to others in what they think of you/your work - but ONLY IF they have your best interests at heart.
1 An extended period of discovery and rigorously honest self-appraisal is incredibly helpful to those who want to be successful. Take time to FIND what you're good at. Put in work on what you want to do, but also be open to whatever unknown gifts within yourself you may uncover. https://t.co/AZXbrj1Lwv
@eodguy89d @scottderrickson @JamieBearse @ScreenPhiles Yes, quite a few.
@jesR216 @scottderrickson @JamieBearse @ScreenPhiles Definitely. Mostly because, as a child, although my environment discouraged believing it was possible to have a career in entertainment, I could at least see other white male directors that allowed me to believe, on some level, it was possible.
@scottderrickson @JamieBearse @ScreenPhiles A natural skill plus the ability to push through and acquire the craft. I’ve seen plenty of people not make it who only had one or the other - but I’ve seen very few who have both unable to earn a living.
@chandleredward2 @Ael_Xander @scottderrickson @johnmaddening @J_L_Walker Part of success is sussing out what you’re good at, and being objective about it.
@chandleredward2 @Ael_Xander @scottderrickson @johnmaddening @J_L_Walker Again, it’s as true as it is about basketball players (of which there are way more of than there are film directors). I’ve seen a lot of people go from no success to making a living as actors, writers &amp; directors - and they all had something from the beginning.
And once again Il Douche tweets about matters in which he has a self-protective personal interest but NEVER about Putin or Russia, who this week were shown to have attacked our country’s power grid and assasinated our allies on allied soil. That’s your hero, Trumpies. https://t.co/lMpvugzyhd
As you know, the probe was based on multiple sources, of which the Dossier - the one that documented you paying hookers to pee for you - was not the primary source, you urine-lapping liar. https://t.co/lMpvugzyhd
@chandleredward2 @johnmaddening @J_L_Walker @scottderrickson Do you believe that about being a professional basketball player?
@ABAOProductions You're welcome.
@RepMarkMeadows And just like that you too can join the ranks of traitors, selling out the US and Republican ideals. Your days siphoning off the American people are numbered.
@ABAOProductions It is not.
Stick to retweeting porn stars. https://t.co/njSGlGMtrq
All of us who care about our country and the Republic, be prepared to march and raise hell. All signs point to Trump attempting to get rid of Mueller soon to avoid taking responsibility for his own misdeeds. https://t.co/Jkoj66iV2t
@chandleredward2 @johnmaddening @J_L_Walker @scottderrickson Scott wasn’t talk about just doing it for fun. Of course anyone can do it for fun.
Agreed. https://t.co/H8O1vrtISD
@chandleredward2 @johnmaddening @J_L_Walker @scottderrickson You are insane. That is not all you need to do to make a living as a director.
@scottderrickson @ScreenPhiles Agreed in the very strongest way.
@thekevinwalters I would charge you very little for that.
@JasonWStanley @cinnabenroll @brunobrookes @seangunn You got it, brother.
“Odious Taint” is what God calls Donald Trump. https://t.co/ErUV1qbSca
@AndreRoyo @MJMcKean Agreed.
@Mmount378 @cinnabenroll @seangunn Dude read about Hitler’s first few years in power. He wasn’t killing those people yet.
@JasonWStanley @cinnabenroll @brunobrookes @seangunn Tell me about it.
@cinnabenroll @brunobrookes @seangunn Trump talks about Muslims and Mexicans almost exactly the way Hitler talked about Jews at the same point in his political career.
@commonsense258 Your “point” was responding to my tweet, which you still don’t seem to understand even after I took the time to explain it to you. Sad!
@NatalieSturowsk @garthdude3 @AshJ_life @ksc02 @HamillHimself Bullshit. SmartAsh specifically said it was not okay to use my voice, not be careful what you listen to.
@commonsense258 It would make you tweet goofy because that has nothing to do with the tweet. This tweet has to do with the nonsensical nature of believing that there is a liberal conspiracy against Trump afoot by these players.
@SLUisville This is the house NOW not when I lived there as a child.
@OttwayKaren @SaltyMofoBeach He did do that. I’m not sure he can fully protect himself against a corrupt President and administration. We may need to protect Mueller ourselves.
Yeah, I know. How far into delusion will those who voted for Trump fall to rationalize their mistake? https://t.co/mfmbslKgC3
@_MrStarLord_ @mccaffreyr3 No
Don’t take my word that Trump is a traitor. Instead, listen to Four-Star General @mccaffreyr3: https://t.co/q4eBtAwsx9
@cinnabenroll @seangunn Like Trump, he didn’t kill anyone in his first few years in office - but MANY of his other actions were the same.
@Gloriousroyalty He is.
@seangunn @cinnabenroll hahaha. I like that I'm Einstein in this scenario.
@MikeTonge @ManMadeMoon Homeland security issued a warning yesterday that our power grid was under continual attacks by the Russians. Maybe do a google search or read the news occasionally before starting arguments on the internet.
@MikeTonge @ManMadeMoon Listen, at least be aware of the current situation when you make these sweeping statements. That may be true, but we have also been attacked by the Russian government in our power grids and in our election machines. That is very clearly under attack by the Russians.
@cinnabenroll And that tweet was picked up by news organizations all over the world to highlight Trump's continuous, flagrant dishonesty. Like I said: Unfollow.
@ThePeteAwakens Impose ALL the sanctions voted on, sanction the oligarchs behind it, not just the ones now that specifically don't hurt Putin; allow the intelligence agencies to spend the 120 million given to fight election interference instead of holding it back. And say something. To start.
@gerardr22 One person - Pompeo - said he'd kill Snowden, not the US justice system.
@cinnabenroll Sorry. Trying to keep us all alive. Plus, I've tweeted lots of other stuff. Please unfollow.
@Phil4Real100 Same here.
@Phil4Real100 👍
It seems Trump is once again attempting to take steps to fire Robert Mueller so Trump will not be held accountable for his own crimes. If that is the case, he will see the greatest &amp; most intense protests this country has ever seen. Sign up here &amp; RT. https://t.co/j9gN4YMKjb
To put it bluntly and simply: Our country is under attack by Russia, and Trump continues to only be interested in and tweet about issues that affect him personally.
And yet you STILL have not tweeted a single negative word about Putin or Russia after they attacked our power grid, killed our allies on allied soil, threatened Florida with an imaginary warhead, and interfered in our elections. NOT. A. SINGLE. WORD. You traitorous piece of shit. https://t.co/Yk5pYQxJ6n
@WilliamFHolman Of course, the toilets are golden. That's where the Hollywood elite part comes in.
These are the first two homes I lived in as a member of the "Hollywood Elite." https://t.co/fUsuCptJvm
@Angelo_Pappas_ Before that I was in south St. Louis.
@Angelo_Pappas_ You're forgetting the money he inherited when his father died, and the multiple millions of dollars his father used to bail him out on many occasions.
@Angelo_Pappas_ 14 years.
@AshJ_life @ksc02 He does lie every day. That is a fact, not an opinion, which I thought was what you cared about: https://t.co/rhxvdiQBql
@AshJ_life @ksc02 This is noxious. It's not okay for us, because we love our country, our world, &amp; our fellow human beings, to use our platforms to combat the President, who uses HIS platform to spout lies every day? Bad news for you, because I'm going to keep using my voice, loudly.
@tsdenizen $150.
@SenfBrian And then he bragged afterwards it was worth it because he put the author through so much financial difficulty. What a guy.
And that’s IF Trump’s the billionaire he claims - which is unlikely considering he recently couldn’t prove in a court of law that this was the case.
Let’s also note that if Trump had simply invested the money in an S&amp;P 500 index he’d be richer today than he is now due to all his shitty business ventures. Because it was his father, not him, who had the business acumen.
Astounding how many times a day Trumpies call me the “Hollywood Elite.” I’m from the suburbs of Manchester, Missouri and made my own way 100% - unlike our asshat President, given hundreds of millions of dollars by daddy.
@Netto When you find if
@Angelo_Pappas_ That’s still over a year. Quit trying to rationalize Trump’s inability to hire decent people. It is staggering and unprecedented. One would almost have to try to be as bad as he is.
@ianrodriguezid Most of the same yes - almost everyone who is available. But I’m saying one film takes that long.
@ashpunj I’m from Manchester, Missouri and I made my own way one hundred percent in this world, unlike Trump. Hardly an elite. And I have the right to put forth my opinion like any American citizen.
@ianrodriguezid MORE employees work on one of my films than in the White House, and we have teams directly below us that are about the same size. And the percentages have nothing to do with the number of people.
@Angelo_Pappas_ Nope. To make a spectacle film it’s over two years - for some, like mine, up to three. Far longer than Trump’s been President. Time for you to come up with a different rationalization.
I would be the worst director in the world if 50% of the people I hired I either fired or quit. A director, like a President, needs to be able to accurately appraise others’ characters and talents to get the job done. Trump is incapable of this, and unfit to be President. https://t.co/JrkC5S3jLo
“Hahaha! I’m incredibly fucking incompetent! Hahahaha! I can’t hire anyone worthwhile because I’m a moron! Hahaha! I mean you guys should have known after most my businesses completely failed and US banks wouldn’t even lend me money! Hahaha! Who’s next?!” https://t.co/wfXyvwYU75
@igasu And then fires them and then hires other best people and then they quit and on and on and on into infinity...
@retrograde This is really goofball. Do you know Donald &amp; Melania have OFTEN flown separately? The Trump family's monthly spending has significantly exceeded the Obamas every single month.
@jaybruce3 Well, that would make you an idiot since I didn't start talking crap about him until about three months ago when I woke up and saw our entire republic was in danger.
Remember how often Trump used to put Obama on blast for government waste? And now see how much MORE money HE and his cabinet spend? How do Trumpies reconcile this? https://t.co/p559TLdKOq

@jade_tippens They are together at the end of Vol. 2.
@ParkerJames23 It was about having a very small gap between 1 &amp; 2.
@DatabaseJase @brandonleblanc Movies that came out after it I mean ugh 😞

@rob_laser @paulfeig Unions or law dictate what is overtime- I don’t know. But I do know on my sets you spend at least 10 hours less a week at work, 5 hrs less working. In the US everyone gets a lunch break except a few key positions who get paid massive overtime. THAT’S what you’re complaining about
@ZootopiaCity I hear you.
Let’s impeach Trump so he doesn’t get us all killed, because if we’re dead we won’t be able to see this. https://t.co/BeUemJEbcd
Important to note, although just announcing it, the government has known this Russsian attack has been going on for at least many months. Which means during all of Trump’s apologies for Putin &amp; his refusals to impose sanctions or fight cyberterrorism he KNEW this was happening. https://t.co/nMK21PESr8
@BITC0IN_BITC0IN They did. They found me in a skid-row ditch. And then I created a multi billion dollar franchise. Their unusual process worked! (Unlike our President).
@Selestrielle Not on film sets.
@rob_laser @paulfeig 5 days a week.
@GregorySolis We do 10 hours in the edit room all the time.
@curtis_campsall Economically it doesn’t, no.
@rob_laser @paulfeig I’ve never talked to a crew member who doesn’t prefer it (as do I, and I’m also a crew member).
@creativelytired 5.
@rob_laser @paulfeig Huh?
@purrist00 @VladtheImpala Uh huh 😐
@BITC0IN_BITC0IN It’s hard to grasp that someone could be as gullible as this tweet indicates.
@HasGlasses @connie_rodeconn @SLSmith000 Just now
I do the same on every project. Every person I work with finds it a much more pleasant way to work, especially when you’re shooting a movie for 4-6 months. https://t.co/EWkOQiAA83
Two weeks ago: NBC reports McMaster is on his way out. Trump calls it “Fake news.”   Today: McMaster is fired.   The only consistency we have is the dishonesty of Donald Trump.
@BradmanTV Dude I have at ten-to-one tweets on what happened in the U.K. and its relationship to Russia vs. the situation relating to gun control.
@captmotorcycle Nope - these people get a fair amount of publicity in other countries where there’s no gun violence. Maybe find another rationalization for why it’s not GUN LAWS.
@IamMooz @cearonoflynn YUP
A) My movies are all shown uncut in other countries - &amp; are more popular in many - where there are almost no deaths due to gun violence. The difference? More gun restrictions. B) Long term studies have shown violent entertainment does NOT beget more violence in people. C) “Rife.” https://t.co/NhLIvEf8rv
@smarmyEOD @Wrecksdart Dude. All incredibly irrelevant - like very obviously irrelevant - to the point as well.
@BradmanTV Ludicrous. The point of some jokes isn’t to make people laugh it’s to illustrate an incredibly important point.
@theresnosink @RoadKingMichael I did walk into you just as you were saying something utterly moronic - sorry for that.
@Died_Stoned @eodguy89d That is the absolute intention of it.
@Died_Stoned @eodguy89d Ben Shapiro is pretending those kids make up a sizable portion of the kids who walked out. They are not, nor even close. He’s lying to diminish the power of the vast majority of these kids. THAT’S human garbage to me.
@NickSchiltz You realize that’s fucking ridiculous right? Or have you bought in? Over 99% of the kids marching were doing it for gun reform.
Hey, kids, the right wing thinks you’re too stupid to think for yourselves. But you guys have moved me countless times over the past few days - I have an incredible amount of hope for our future, because our future is YOU. https://t.co/HhkJwd1arr
@Justin_Stangel @CartoonKeith Me
@SirDavidThStout And then never condemned them.
@SirDavidThStout He has not. Again, he said Russia “or whoever else” may be at fault.
@smarmyEOD @Wrecksdart Not a false analogy, and incredibly flawed logic on your part. The first point, about expecting a state response, is irrelevant to the point (like bafflingly irrelevant). The second point would also be true of inmates responses to victims with Russian nerve agent.
Very cool. Thanks, @SaturnAwards1! https://t.co/CHaHnkVh2N
@ghost_tyger @navalny I would like to, but he posts mostly in Russian, so...
THIS is what needs to happen. To Putin, the innocent Russian people and his not-so-innocent flunkies are disposable. You need to hit him and his fellow oligarchs personally, in the pocketbooks. https://t.co/pJd5AaD1YZ
@Charliemilo No, but I did hear about @prattprattpratt doing it first.
@Neoxon193 @CartoonKeith They don't have the Walkman - you have to take a lot of time to memorize the data before it's gone - but they do have many clones of Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and 2, which we actually hear in the second film (that's what the Ravagers have).
I would be fine with teachers carrying fictional laser guns and making pew-pew noises. https://t.co/IWuBpk4vSp
@CartoonKeith It's like 3D printing - it keeps a memory of the ship so it can recreate any part of it at any time. Time consuming and expensive, but worth it.
@SirDavidThStout When Trump was asked about it, clearly, yesterday, and everyone - including the White House - had said is was Russia, Trump said he would condemn Russia "or whoever it was" when the facts came to light and they found out who it was. He still has not.
It IS important we discuss this. And the best way to keep chemical weapons out of schools is to give teachers chemical weapons. #NRA https://t.co/3xP6xnY3sv
Perhaps all those people wouldn’t have been hurt by that Russian nerve agent if good people on the streets had their own Russian nerve agents to stop them. #NRA
Any time Trump allows anything to happen against Russia, it’s never something that hurts his boss, Putin, personally. https://t.co/4hDJd9JtrO
If a Russian nerve agent was used on someone in our country, we could count on Trump helping Putin to get it done. It’s outrageous this traitor is still our President. If this was an Islamic attack Trump would not have shut up about it. https://t.co/5iz1SBGqMN
We have the State Media of a foreign country declaring our President belongs to them &amp; STILL Trump has never said a word against them, nor taken a single step toward stopping them from interfering in our elections, nor enacted bipartisan agreed upon sanctions. Now it’s treason. https://t.co/HE8BxZP0uY
🖕, @TomiLahren. https://t.co/eDJ3AKPy51
And although people around him have said it IS the Russians who attacked, he’s only said he will condemn Russia or “whoever it may be.” Again &amp; again &amp; again Trump capitulates to Putin - on this, on Putin’s threats &amp; on his attempts to interfere in our elections. #TraitorTrump https://t.co/gsCBFfOt2d
