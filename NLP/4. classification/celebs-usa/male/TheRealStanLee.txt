Jeez, at age 95 am I the oldest person on twitter? Is this a new world record?
Thanks to my friend @Jack who created Twitter, I am only on Twitter. No other social media. The rest like Facebook are hacked and people impersonating me. But I love Twitter. https://t.co/zCZ0Pa4hxY
Hey @jk_rowling if you ever want me to send Doctor Strange &amp; The X-Men to Hogwarts to teach a few classes, just let me know. I think they could also hold down the fort against Voldemort.
I agree with @elonmusk that the media should be held accountable to tell the truth. Many reporters are honost but Fake news outlets like Hollywood Reporter should not be spreading lies. Go Elon!
With great power comes great responsibility. Excelsior!
The United States has a President, but I want to be the President of the world. Who will vote for me?
Never give up on your dreams! When I first wrote Spider-Man my publisher said I was crazy because people hate spiders and insects and he was not going to publish it. But I never gave up, until it was published.
I think @TomHolland1996 is a great Spider-Man. He is the exact height and age I envisioned when I first wrote Spider-Man. Spidey was never supposed to be too large. How is my friend Tom doing?
My Facebook has been hacked. Can my dear fans all please send a message to @facebook and Mark Zuckerberg to help me?

Help! Someone has hijacked my Facebook and Instagram. I want everyone to know whoever is writing them is a fraud and is impersonating me. How do I get them back? Can you guys help?
How do I post a video on twitter? I want to answer your questions.
Happy mothers day! I maybe 95 years old, but I still miss my lovely mother Celia. Please enjoy this special day and tell them I send them my love and best wishes.
Excelsior!
Today was the first day I ever did a tweet myself. Before today, my account was done by others. I still do not have control of my Facebook. Someone else is doing it, NOT me.

.@DragonKiss83 @More2History I don't know.  One of the best things about the show is the fact that I'm always surprised by the powers...
.@AnneBreeding @More2History Nope.  I just hoped the comic books would sell so I could keep paying my rent.
.@Alex_THiddy @More2History I had to create them.  It was my job and I didn't want to be fired.  I relate most to Tony Stark (@Iron_Man)
.@ubadojw1 @More2History Unfailing good luck!
.@REDKITEMASTER @More2History no.

Your generalissimo is in @Marvel’s #AgentsofSHIELD! Look for my mighty cameo Feb. 4! @AgentsofSHIELD
Thanx for watching, my brave #Brigadiers! What did u think of yr #Generalissimo's 1st ever leading role on @HubTVNetwork's #StanLeeMighty7?
.@raminserry What do I think of @starwars? Before I answer that, tell me what #StarWars thinks of me
And how can you forget about the outstanding preformance by your Generous #Generalissimo as well, Me #StanLee
Since I wasn't available to play the role I don't think anybody could do a better job as Strong Arm than the amazing Armie Hammer
Once you've seen him act you know that Michael Ironside was born to play Xanar
.@DoveMeir What would a superhero want on his gravestone?  They would want it to say "sorry, I'm not dead yet."
I'm happy to say that @HatchingChange's acting is as beautiful as her looks
We should've had the fabulous @flea333 saying every line to get our full value out of him!
.@Misskatrinalaw would I cast you as Hawkeye’s sidekick in Avengers 2? Why the hell not?
@TheJamesHong Lopan vs Dr. Doom? Whoever the script writer wants to win
Face it, @JimBelushi can do no wrong!
.@TheDaveKlein I can't blame them on anything but my own imagination
.@MKnight24 try not to answer so many questionnaires
.@DarrenCriss is quite GLEEful as Micro and he plays the role perfectly!
I like the fact that @ChristianSlate4 is such a fine actor and we were lucky enough to get him to play laser Lord!
Who is your favorite #StanLeesMighty7 character? Mine, Stan lee the thing I like most about him is the fact that he sounds so much like me
.@Karonaman It was an easy decision to make as soon as they started paying me for it
.@YosoyPuli why pick anyone else I'm still available
Now that we’re halfway into #StanLeesMighty7 what do ya think so far? I think I like to do another hundred episodes!
.@missmayim ran so fast you were lucky to hear her voice. But she was great!
.@SeanAstin did a great job as did all of our actors I am lucky we were able to get such a talented group of actors for our movie
.@MEGGA_USA Food mainly
.@o_riginal_name the stories I've done provide enjoyment to people that's legacy enough for me
.@devincols58 since they don't give Oscars for cameos I figured I needed a starring role in order to win an Academy award
.@standardman If you’re referring to my every day life full of heroic deeds and avdventurous POW!tastic exploits…then yes!
.@NoxDMartinez I guess that’s something you’ll have to watch to find out.
.@theimprobrunner It’s hard to say b/c I’m still doing them, perhaps I haven’t filmed my favorite yet if I had to choose I’d say all of ‘em

and no power on Earth will stop us from exacting a swift and mighty vengeance.

but we must never rest till those responsible are caught and dealt with by the real super heroes of our time--
