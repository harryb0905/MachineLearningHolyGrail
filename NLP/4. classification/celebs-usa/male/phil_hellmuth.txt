I agree @PaulGees81!  Shot clocks especially unfair when you play fast all day long (2-3 seconds to fold), and then need time; meanwhile, some players study 10-20 seconds EVERY hand!!  Chess clock is ideal...Maybe we can figure out how to implement chess clock soon... https://t.co/w3ZbP7v52a

My 30-to-1 @HoustonTexans to win the Super Bowl bet sparked a lot of doubt on social media!  But I‚Äôm doubling down!  I believe they have a great coach, although many of you attacked that premise...Also, I think they‚Äôre underrated: JJ and DW were basically out first 3 games (0-3).

Good day betting @NFL: I had @Eagles -6 vs @Redskins, and @ChicagoBears +6 vs @Vikings.  Great practice for @DraftKings $10,000 buy in ‚ÄúNational Championships of Sports Betting‚Äù Jan 11-13 ($1 million guaranteed for 1st): https://t.co/Y7w3KFLo4S Watching Baltimore Game now: crazy!
I just made a 2nd half bet: I bet Alabama -6.5.  Bama looks pretty dominant so far, thinking that will continue.  Plus, who makes better 1/2 time adjustments than Coach Saban? #Bama
Thinking that Alabama‚Äôs Defense has NFL quality players and great coaches, and will hold Oklahoma under 22 points, maybe under 19 points #NFLDefense
I‚Äôm betting Alabama -13.5

Video of Monday‚Äôs tennis bet in FLA is coming...I bet $7,000 I could return 1-out-of-20, 80 MPH serves from a pro, into play, I bet my $2K to $16K I could score point (as rank beginner was a HUGE dog!).  Imagined myself hitting a beautiful $23,000 return up the line: NOT, but...
Well, @JBPritzker is smart, has high ethics and morals, is humble for his accomplishments/lofty position, he told me last night ‚ÄúI know what i don‚Äôt know‚Äù (he‚Äôll hire knowledgeable people), and is looking out for others (he already has billions $$).

I happen to be in the two states today where the vote matters most to me. In FLA, poker community desperately needs a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù vote on Amendment 3. In Illinois, @JBPritzker is the MAN, going for Governor, and I‚Äôll be there tonight to celebrate w him (thinking positively, GO JB!!).

Had a shot to win $26,000 on tennis court today!  I hadn‚Äôt hit a ball in 3 years, and played 20 times lifetime. 3 bets in play: hit 1-in-20 80 MPH serves in play $7,000; score a point vs PRO serving them to me my $2k to their $16k; score pt vs pro serving 40 MPH $3K. Video today!
Word of my tennis bet has spread, and someone asked if they could film it: w 3 cameras. I agreed. The plan is to put out a few videos tomorrow...And maybe show it LIVE on https://t.co/Eb9957Ic86 at 1 PM EST. Not one person in my 10 person crew is betting on me!!! #YeOfLittleFaith
We hired two pros to serve to us on Monday. I bet $7,000 (so far) I could hit an 80 MPH serve back into play given 20 attempts.  Further, I bet $2,000 to $16,000 I could score a point on one of those serves against the pro. I am a rank amateur, but I believe I‚Äôm a big favorite!
Really?!  Folded J-J for 7 bigs in a Charity tourn where my biggest incentive was beating @ChadPower for small last longer bet! My opponent had K-K!!  I just beat Chad for last longer! #AlwaysFightHard #GreatLaydown https://t.co/X97lxbBamN

Betting $5,000 that I can hit just 1-out-of-20 80 miles-per-hour tennis serves back in play.  Also, my $2,000 to $16,000 that I can score one point off of the serve (against a pro tennis player)!  I am a rank beginner, but thinking of betting more...Will send out videos Monday!

In the PGA, golfs last major: GO to my boys @TigerWoods and @DJohnsonPGA!  I bet on @BKoepka and DJ #FunSweat @PGATour
4 prologue - an MRI showed I have a herniated disc: caused Sciatica. Herniated disc - no big deal, great diagnosis.  After 3.5 months of some pain, I received a steroid shot Fri, and 65% it will resolve itself. I have no complaints folks: HD yes, but kept my head up! #POSITIVITY
3 Five weeks into @WSOP, still a lot of Sciatica pain, still no final tables, but kept my head up.  No excuses PH, #ManUp!  And I kept showing up...  Then late late, BOOM, I won a @WSOP Bracelet!  #NeverGiveUp #NoExcuses #FExcuses

1 Stay positive! May 1st, Sciatica was diagnosed, no big deal, except painful!  May 10 - June 25 I took MAX Advil (3 pills 3X a day), and limped around @WSOP feeling pain in every step. My Dr. cut me off, Advil is dangerous after 27 days in-a-row. Painful, but I kept my head up.

Some great players still alive in @WSOP Main Event, LIVE NOW on @ESPN and LIVE later on @PokerGo App: @Barry_Hutter @ShannonShorr @EFroPoker @Cada99 (World Champion) Yueqi Zhu @PollakB @SylvainLoosli
Tip of my cap to the amazing @JamesObst.  If his A-A would have held vs 10-10, all in pre-flop for 15 MILLLION chip pot, then James would have been one of chip leaders, w the talent, and patience to Final Table.  James was deep in ME last year as well #GiveCreditWhereCreditIsDue

I agree, criticism is warranted, and I know I was out of line.  I owned it, I apologized for it, and as a gesture of goodwill I‚Äôm buying Camby into next years @WSOP Main Event.  But Erik - Justin accused me of ‚Äúintentional act of sabotage.‚Äù  And obs that didn‚Äôt happen https://t.co/znsfLji8mz
I agree, I should be penalized when I cross the line...Ike used the word ‚ÄúEvery time,‚Äù which is NOT true https://t.co/URkzuJSouc

@JCamby33 I lost some sleep over my outburst. I believe you lose the hand anyway, but maybe I am wrong. You handled yourself well, and played well.  As a gesture of goodwill, and because I respect policeman and firefighters: I‚Äôm going to buy you into 2019 $10,000 @WSOP Main Event

Nursing my usual social media thrashing: reserved for when I do something wrong (a Poker Brat rant in a 3-way hand).  Still in bed w wifey listening to 70s music; resting. I wish I wasn‚Äôt so emotional at the tables! My chips are in play, being ante‚Äôd off, BUT I‚Äôll come in STRONG!
Plus, I truly believe the Russian was calling you anyway.  But my apology stands.  My emotional behavior may be good television, but it‚Äôs too much sometimes. https://t.co/CgwL4ivoRb
I apologize for swearing. It was a 3-way pot and I shouldn‚Äôt have lost it. It was the 15th time you moved all in on me, and my emotions got the better of me.  But you were never winning that hand.  You snap moved all in, and I was never folding 7-7 on draw heavy board of 10-4d-3d https://t.co/CgwL4ivoRb

I was out of line and went Poker Brat for a minute.  100% my fault.  Then I was called, loudly, a ‚ÄúBad person,‚Äù a ‚ÄúP.O.S.‚Äù (he shouted that one 3x), a wimp, a bad poker player, and more.

Felt like I ‚ÄúDeserved‚Äù to win my @WSOP Day 2 Shoot Out Table Weds based on my play. But, in poker, over a 10-year period (400 tourneys), people generally get what they deserve. Play great every tourney, and you will make final tables; and win!!  #GreatPlayWillEventuallyBeRewarded

Really loved playing the @WSOP Omaha 8/B tourney the last two days.  So much skill, and such a great structure.  Still feeling down after finishing 37th late last night, a mere 30 mins from Day 3...It was a great opportunity to win a bracelet! #Ouch #GetOverIt
Unbelievably, for the first time in a 2018 @WSOP tourney, today I finally had a 10X stack (started w 7500 and I not only hit 75,000, I had it up to 190,000 üöÄüöÄ).  Gave myself a great chance to Final Table, but needed a few of my hands to hold up!
Fought my heart out in @WSOP Omaha 8/B tourn. Made level 20, 30 mins from Day 3. Lost one big pot after my opponent forgot what game we were playing, and threw in the wrong amount of chips!  He was trying to raise, but his call cost me most of my chips, sigh..Super frustrated...
Happy Fathers Day to all of the fathers out there!  Blessed to be able to hug my Dad today in Vegas.  Love you Dad, thanks for the support and all of the great advice over 50 years.  I‚Äôm proud to have two terrific sons: love you guys!  #POSITIVITY #HappyFathersDay

Thanks for the encouragement!!  Despite making three Day 2s already, I‚Äôm discouraged.  Giving myself great chances w patience and steadiness, but cards have let me down: feeling ‚ÄúSnake bit‚Äù (poker term) right now... https://t.co/wX6iPVLLoG
Next A hits Q, A-4-4-Q, I hit a K (3-2) 6-5-2-K and Bad Gambler hits a 4 (8-7) 9-8-4-4.  W 6-5-3-2, 4-4 sits on my right and 4-4 sits on my left!  If BG folds 9 (8-7) (easy fold), then I make a straight in five.  Instead, I hit a five, and bust 125th, 110 paid. Taking a day off!
Stud 8/B: 2 is low, I complete w 6c (3-2) vs high cards behind and an Ace.  9 (8-7) calls (Wow), A raises, I call.  A hits 4, I hit 5c, amateur 8.  Now we CAP it, including (8-7) 9-8 (WTF!).  I need a 4 for straight: A hits a 4, sigh, I hit a 2, 9-8 hits a 4, sigh.  I‚Äôm all in.
With some hands it feels like you‚Äôre being laughed at!  I‚Äôm going to release a video of the hand I just lost #SuperTilting #IsThisForReal #TakingTheDayOff

Matt - I posted two $10k tournies lifetime on @YouStake and cashed for over $50,000 both times.  I have best R. O. I. In history (see USA Today article a few years back).

You are 100% right Jake.  They were criminally negligent.  Someone should go down for this; would be good for the game. https://t.co/45mv2o8qGZ
I‚Äôve written a big chapter in ‚ÄúPoker Brat‚Äù about UB, check it out https://t.co/Tiyxtx0sAn
And what about the money the govt confiscated?  Or are you saying that didn‚Äôt happen now? https://t.co/bbnP1kB2sn
Smart points.  Was it Chris‚Äôs decision to use FTP as a slush fund?  And if not, should he be punished? https://t.co/6TtKZRNDYN
Rick, you (and red pros, and many others) were completely screwed.  I acknowledge that... https://t.co/NPTZVfM39P
First of all, I‚Äôve talked to Chris 10-20 times in the last 8 years (NOT defending him because we are close, but rather because I think it‚Äôs the right thing). Second, I believe that 90% plus of the truth will come out, and then we can see whether you‚Äôre right, or whether im right https://t.co/kPNNAVnQgT
Don‚Äôt misrepresent my statements.  Of course people should have been upset.  I take issue w WHO was painted as the pariah https://t.co/OduKVxq8YS
Dan - I would have ignored my attorneys advice and made a statement.  And fought hard to put a clear spotlight on what really happened, rather than let the haters frame a flawed, and untruthful story... https://t.co/1LA2VESsK4
If you‚Äôre out w Chris in public anywhere, he has lots of fans.  Most of the casual poker fans in the USA do not follow this story https://t.co/LN105OWl7H
They messed that up for sure.  I‚Äôm not saying they didn‚Äôt make mistakes!! https://t.co/uB6e1cd36T
Yep, you‚Äôre right about this much.  Are you saying Chris should pay back the red pros? https://t.co/I3YrjMbv5Z
I believe that did happen.  I was hit and miss in those matches... https://t.co/NUvzo2Nu07
I think you‚Äôre wrong, but I admit that I may be wrong.  But all good, I like you Joey. https://t.co/vQ1fDwuw0a
You can tell I‚Äôm being playful at the end, but ‚ÄúYou shut up!‚Äù #YouShutUp #NoYouShutUp https://t.co/zZnq95Zian
I consider myself to have PERFECT ETHICS and PERFECT MORALS.  Ask anyone on the planet if I‚Äôve EVER done anything wrong.  I‚Äôm happy that your generation is as clean as me: that‚Äôs a great thing https://t.co/TzJl67O9eg
I thought everyone heard the tapes that went public a few years back and completely exonerated me.  Also, I have a great chapter in my book ‚ÄúPoker Brat‚Äù about UB: read it. https://t.co/EZVusW3DvU
They stole hundreds of millions from poker players?  Didn‚Äôt know that: I thought a bunch of money was confiscated by the govt, and then paid back in full to the players directly, years later.  But maybe your right Joey, if you are, then I am wrong https://t.co/D0JCTjc0Pc
Harsh... https://t.co/LfRGQi7F8A
Here is a video from Chris Ferguson.  It‚Äôs a shame that so many of the younger poker players have JUDGED Chris so harshly.  I believe that the whole truth about Full Tilt Poker will come out, and I believe the ‚ÄúHaters‚Äù will be surprised #IAmALoverNOTAJudge https://t.co/CABB6MXqS6

Every Major sport (NBA, NFL, MLB) is behind the legalization of sports betting, and all of them will profit by it. But how can Sports Betting online be legalized w/out online poker being legalized (clearly more skill than sports betting)? The time is NOW to legalize online poker!

Dilemma 3: I lost my initial $5,000 buy in at 3 AM, whilst playing well, smartly left the table for room service and a shower.  Do I buy in again?  For how much?  How much do I risk before I quit?  Two hours and 11 mins until ‚Äúwheels up.‚Äù  More next tweet...
Dilemma 2: I chose poker, even though I knew I was exhausted.  Then what size game? 1. Too small, and I‚Äôm not paying attention and will lose 2. Too big and I could lose a lot when I‚Äôm exhausted I chose $50-$100 NoLimHold‚Äôem, bought in $5,000.  How much do I risk?  Next tweet...
Dilemma: I‚Äôm exhausted, my private flight at 11 PM Thurs is somehow rescheduled for 6 AM and zero commercial flights home Friday. Do I: 1.) sleep 5 hours and hop flt 2.) Play poker until 5:15 AM and hop flt 3.) sleep in If poker, then what size game?  More in next tweet...

More truth https://t.co/DWpuRHto5j
No, my Ego is too big and I needed you to doubt me publicly, and tell the world I'm NOT in the top 100 in NLHold'em. That list motivates me! https://t.co/2BE5rT85vR
You gave me what I wanted, and what I needed: the list.  U really didn't think that Twitter exchange was random, did you? https://t.co/wIrRB1q0Pt
I wanted you to go public w your list of players that you believe are better than me in NLHold'em tournies: for my own reasons... https://t.co/mtmdhUrgyf
No, I don't care about betting, I think I'm huge fav over 40 players in all Hold'em tournies, but it's a huge distraction to my real goals. https://t.co/72zu3fIr2F
Jesse May called me an outlier!!  Thanks Jesse, cool thing to say, but My Ego tomorrow when I wake up ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è (rising...higher...higher) https://t.co/vkpsv2w6hO
Thanks Shawn, appreciate that, I love the Keller bros like you guys love me. https://t.co/otOA1eVjPC
Yes, you're 100% right, but this is not a random event in a vacuum.  Players expect me to lose it... https://t.co/AVmVpB0ZMD
You would prefer that I act perfectly all the time?  That I never lose it? https://t.co/vF8JH84Spa
Do you think ANYONE takes it personally?  Even one player on the field?  Or do they laugh and enjoy the show? https://t.co/ofKMJIK8ww
Perfectly said: see below @RealKidPoker https://t.co/gXrKNYBH0V
I don't think they're bad, I think almost all the players on your list are top 100 in the world. Yes, I "Lose it" &amp; mutter about bad players https://t.co/CDqwLkxNWn
I'm the Brat and he's the nice guy?!?  Hmm...I never said anything negative about Daniel or his poker skills... https://t.co/nibOC0D45l
My boy @realkidpoker (I really do love Daniel) has always doubted my poker skills. It's been great for me!!  He always beats me up #Humbling
For the fans out there that think we don't like each other: we love each other.  Daniel has written over 40 BLOGS on how badly I play poker https://t.co/GJZJB6Q0PK
You make it seem like I'm NOT LOVED by the poker world.  That's not right, and I KNOW you love me as well...And vice-versa https://t.co/j0Cd1KJDjl
Please Daniel, I told Steffen and Fedor that I liked them.  Almost everyone in the poker knows im a good guy and likes me #DontHitLow https://t.co/HIvBSRVcSd
Are they no Limit Hold'em players?!?  Or just play 20-100 man fields in 1 or Day tourneys?  Bring a list of REAL players to me https://t.co/EuASC9yS4p
Start writing, 40 names total, and I'll accept your cross book.  Can't wait to win next @WSOP bracelet for $800k x 20 ($16 million from you) https://t.co/pm1vytQ8iu
