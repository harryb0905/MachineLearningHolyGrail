@SmilePolitely @alyankovic @EmoPhilips @thevirginia @ebertfest Oh My Goodness! I remember when Roger and I saw @EmoPhillips perform in Edinburgh at the Fringe festival. I hope Roger can look down and get a bird's eye view of Emo and @alyankovic right now. Priceless. (from @ChazEbert for Roger)

"I was born inside the movie of my life. The visuals were before me, the audio surrounded me, the plot unfolded inevitably but not necessarily. I don't remember how I got into the movie, but it continues to entertain me." #LifeItselfEbert @EbertChicago @ChazEbert https://t.co/fDxQwRRDkD
@ebertfest @ChazEbert @Illinois_Alma Seeing this Throwback moment made me a weepy mess, because it was when we were unspooling the program at @Ebertfest that I realized Roger KNEW he wouldn't be there with us. He planned every moment of it, including the order each film would be shown and which guests would be there

@PattyJenks @ChazEbert @richardroeper From @ChazEbert : Patty, as I watched your film I could only think of how proud Roger would have been that you directed it!
Stefano, I remember watching "Grave of the Fireflies" with him and I was just totally destroyed when it was over. So powerful, so sad.. https://t.co/st3ftpkMZB
