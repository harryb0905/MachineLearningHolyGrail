@kittypurrzog You are clearly a Herzog.
@FCTRYWNDRFL Possible, probable even, but I don‚Äôt know the answer to that. I do however believe that you get more of what you incentivize, and culturally, there seem to be many social incentives for victims. I don‚Äôt have a solution to this, but I‚Äôm not done contemplating either.
@CessaPerry @Curt_the_man200 ‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù May be a better word than ‚Äúoften.‚Äù And, while I don‚Äôt disagree with ‚Äúsometimes...‚Äù we could focus on those powerful individuals who don‚Äôt attribute their power to being born lucky. If you look for them, you will find many.
@FCTRYWNDRFL The ability to act or produce an effect.
Maybe the real problem is that, culturally, it has become more socially relevant to be a victim than someone in power. Shouldn‚Äôt the point be transforming victims into powerful people? How do we ever do this if victimhood is worth more, in social currency, than power?

@Jgetty80 wrong, the 22nd amendment's language is specific to being elected to 2 terms. BC could be POTUS if stepping into it from VP.
@jimmymanners @jaskline2007 that only applies if his 2 years take place prior to being elected POTUS.
@AydoganMehmet78 no, I can, but life is better when viewed hyperbolically.
@jaskline2007 @jimmymanners he just can't be elected president. But as VP, he is eligible to take over the POTUS role for the entire term.
@jaskline2007 @jimmymanners it would seem you're both off, I just reread the 22nd amendment. He could serve all four years as president.

Not quite sure why there are no "Sean Kelly for President" posters up in Ireland.
Chickened out of the ride. Couldn't understand a word of the man at the equestrian center but his horse very clearly said "I own you."

It's 105 degrees in Dallas, 108 on this plane, there's no hope for the cache of ice cubes I'm smuggling for #WhenInFrance.
@hornerakg @RadioShackLIVE Towels, processed American "foodstuffs" and bucket of ice, I think I'm all set for #WhenInFrance
@RadioShackLIVE I'm still in the US, should I pick you up some extra towels for #WhenInFrance? The one's in the DFW lounge are really soft.
@hornerakg that's a great idea! Do you think I can buy a second suitcase at the airport? Don't want to bonk #WhenInFrance!
Felt like a non-airplane snack, had the plane stop in Dallas, going to stock up on processed American "food" products for #WhenInFrance.

I know this guy that lies so much I can't believe anything he says, like how he said hello to me today, totally lying.

Anyone: "I'll see you." Me: "NOT if I see you first" because if I do I'll hide from you and your brutal conversation. Try it, go nuts.
Arguing with wife about "not if I see you first." If I say that, I will avoid you seeing me thus the "not." She says I'm wrong, morally.
Inevitably on every "shopping" excursion I am accused of being a subversive element working against females as a species.
My wife's ill-fitting acronym for "Shiftlessly Moving From Shop to Shop in Order to Look at Things You Don't Want or Need" is SHOPPING.
@daxshepard1 But I can't concentrate on the program because all I can think about is food and pills!

Monday's almost gone and I'm sad to see her go. I like Mondays...and masochism.

In my estimation the term "toilet water" has been taken far too literally by the manufacturers.

@Black14th Yes, a hobo. I thought of all the pets they could get it'd be easiest to house break...I was wrong.

@Alyssa_Milano Congratulations! When are you gonna make your mom a grandma?!
I've sworn never to buy another animal a few times in my life. This oath always seems to come the day after my kids get a new pet.
@daxshepard1 That you could even question which reigns supreme is cause for sadness for I am only ever at the former...
Lesson of the day for my kids: save your criticism of my parenting for when I'm dead.
Clementine is off to get a bunny. I told her to make sure it's plump and delicious looking. This comment was not received well.
laid in bed awake for past hour listening to the apocalyptic clang and clatter of kids making breakfast. Fear's taken hold, can not get up.
Kids revolt: refuse dinner then threaten action against parents for malnourishment. I explain it will take weeks to prove, kids eat.
Brandy says that writing about the bowels on twitter is unattractive. I mentioned to her that I was married. Have I missed something?
Discussing the pitfalls and folly of the upper-decker with my kids. I'm more a hide-a-duke man.
@daxshepard1 if only I could convince Brandy to let me drink coffee all day long.

I've introduced myself to two people as "Etan" and it felt really dirty. Jon -9, add an "h" it'll change your life.
I know nothing about Jon & Kate + 8 and my opinion is only that I think I could relate to Jon more if he added an "h" to his name.

Conflicted about Clementines desire to wear "pull-ups" to bed tonight. Do I grant her lazy request out of respect or for a good night sleep?
@daxshepard1 yep, I was super faithful too. Never missed a day, not even on travel days.
Clementine tells me she's getting a bunny this weekend, also, I'm supposed to get one too in case I want to eat hers.
@Bubba_76 the hardcore dance. Its embarrassing.
@Weekenddan I love Gallows. Saw them at sxsw and they did almost their whole show in the pit. Amazing show!
Tempted to check out the warped tour, really just to beat up idiots doing the lame karate-kid dance that's made a mockery of the mosh-pit.
Never-mind Twitter, I doubt your verification could answer that question for me anyway. I'm heading out to find myself, ice cream anyone?
