Ryan Garcia is a 15x national champion fighter. To put him in the ring against a six-rounder like Rolly would be like putting a MLB pitcher up against a high schooler. Not fair. If Floyd wants to make a fight happen, all he has to do is call me and we’ll put together a fair fight
And you were the best trainer I had. #Respect #FloydSr. https://t.co/mXI927UiKC

I’ve given marching orders to my president @makeawar to start talks with @GGGBoxing #CaneloGGG3 @ringmagazine @UnivisionSports @DAZN_USA @espn @Canelo @GGGBoxing @GoldenBoyBoxing
I’m excited for the @mikeygarcia Spence fight. I’m proud that Mikey is daring to be great and fighting at welterweight without knowing what it’s like but without a promoter nobody is taking care of his best interest and Spence is being positioned to become a star by his promoter.
And that’s why it’s dead you dumb ass! https://t.co/lRWpOKJv1N
500k For Jones, Really?! @danawhite and you say you wanna battle. Wait till the fans realize that PPV is dead.
#NoPPV
Hahaha the idiot @FloydMayweather took the bait, I intentionally misspelled to see if the dummy would respond and sure enough he did. Floyd have you apologized to all those women you hit and went to jail for? Just retire already and enjoy @GoldenBoyBoxing in 2019 https://t.co/5UjUR7ZEmA
Hahahahahah bingo https://t.co/iiD3ZUI7ES
Happy Merry Christmas Eve to everyone who is great full and optimistic about life and positive about everything that doesn’t go your way. Life is truly Beutiful if you wake up every morning believing in yourself and in others. And to the haters go fuck your self. Hoho
To all, thank you for all your support you give to the best sport in the world. Let’s enjoy the holidays and can’t wait to announce Canelo’s opponent for May. #UWillBeShocked

@Gervontaa you are a beast in the ring and fun to watch, give me a call so I can get you some fights on @DAZN_USA
Hey, @Canelo someone is salty about your record breaking contract with @DAZN_USA. Good thing we will never resort to hitting women.   #DomesticAbuser #DomesticViolence #AntiDomesticViolence #Salty #FloydMayweather #SaltyFloyd #FloydSaltyMayweather #whyyoumad https://t.co/tUT43eEMCi
My account was hacked, I just want to make you are that this was not me. - Last night was an unfortunate turn of events during one of the biggest and important fights in UFC history.
Almost time for the main event!! Watch @JorgeLinares take on Abner Cotto up next on Facebook Watch: https://t.co/JDREND1hkb https://t.co/xpqDdRH76G
4/4: None of this would have been possible without @HBO. - I wish Richard Plepler, Peter Nelson and the entire @hboboxing team all the best in their future endeavors.
3/4: Multiple networks are now televising boxing; streaming services are bringing the sport to countless additional fans; and arenas across the world are now packed to the rafters to watch the sport of kings.
2/4: For four decades, @hboboxing helped carry boxing through its highest peaks and deepest valleys, and in the end it leaves the sport in the best shape it has been in many years.
1/4: As someone who fought on HBO 32 times and worked with the network to televise hundreds of fights under the @goldenboyboxing banner, I know firsthand the debt of gratitude the sport of boxing owes everyone at the company.
@TigerWoods fuck the haters!
Now that’s the real heavyweight champion of the universe @anthonyfjoshua
@anthonyfjoshua you are the man!!!!!
Just keep that right hand glued to your chin, that Povetkin left hook is thunder!!
How do you experts have it through round 3
Love the production!!! Let’s go @anthonyfjoshua
The heavyweights are back!!!!
All good , really excited about this one
@danrafaelespn @Canelo @makeawar @RamirosCorner @GabeRivas03 @GoldenBoyBoxing @stefanfriedman Fake news Dan, I haven’t confirmed if he’s fighting in December or an opponent  for that matter.
What are you talking about Bob? @HBOboxing is the strongest brand in boxing today, pulls in the best ratings bar none. @StephenEspinoza is doing good things at showtime as well. #whowatchesESPN+
People, meet @GoldenBoyBoxing future star #virgilortiz the real f*#ck deal!!
Felicidades @Canelo por demostrar el corazón, valentía, coraje y mas importante el orgullo de ser Mexicano. Que viva la independencia Mexicana!!!

Half hour to decide if the biggest fight in boxing will take place. #whereisggg
t-minus two hours. Somehow I think @eddiehearn @frankwarren_tv and Al Haymon won't be as difficult to reach as @gggboxing #whereisggg
@canelo wants it, @goldenboyboxing wants it, the media want it, fans want it. Paging @gggboxing. #whereisggg
Tic-Toc, Tic-Toc. If any fight freaks see @GGGBoxing in Russia, perhaps you can lend him a pen. #whereisGGG
Congratulations to @leosantacruz2 on a great fight and hats off to @abnermares for saying those kind words to Leo’s father who is now in remission from cancer. Congratulations @ShowtimeBoxing for another great main event.

@Canelo is moving on, the only possible way he fights @GGGBoxing in September is on same terms we agreed on after the first fight.  #danieljacobs #charlo #sounders
@GGGBoxing good look with Sergiy Derevyanchenko who’s 11-0 and your IBF mandatory the train has moved on and going after Danny Jacobs, Saunders, @spike_osullivan
Why would I be disappointed when I’m the only promoter willing to make good fights win or loose for the fans. https://t.co/rT70kW8svY
What an amazing fight congratulations @mrgaryrusselljr and @JosephDiazJr   In one week @GoldenBoyBoxing 4 world tittle fights with 4 different promoters on 3 networks. #fightsforthefans #realpromoter

As excited as anyone that big fight between @JorgeLinares and @vasyllomachenko is getting close. But it's not done yet. And until lead promoter @bobarum picks up the phone and calls @makeawar, nothing can proceed #makethecall #linareslomachenko
@mannypacquiao vs @MatthysseLucas would be a fight of the year candidate.
@BronzeBomber congratulations on such a great accomplishment when everyone doubted you, hit me up when you wanna make real money and have someone who will promote you to be a PPV star.
6., So, @VasylLomachenko has three options. 1) Fight on May 12th on HBO 2) Fight on any other day on the calendar, 3) walk away from the fight all fans of the sport want to see. I am hopeful he chooses one of the first two.
5., HBO is willing to pay more for the fight than is currently being offered. And they would do it on May 12th.
4., While @JorgeLinares is happy to fight on any other date of the calendar, if @VasylLomachenko absolutely, positively must fight on the 12th we have a solution.
3., We know of no bylaw, Ukranian holiday or "magic day" in the words of Bob Arum that mandates that @VasylLomachenko can only fight on one day during the spring and summer month — May 12th.
2., @JorgeLinares wants this fight. @GoldenBoyBoxing wants this fight. Mr. Honda wants this fight. And collectively we are doing everything we can to get these two champions into the ring.
1., Over the last days, there has been a lot of rumor and speculation about the potential fight between @JorgeLinares and @VasylLomachenko. The facts are pretty clear.
@BobArum @mannypacquiao vs @MatthysseLucas would be a barn burner. #fansfirst #war
@danrafaelespn @JorgeLinares @VasylLomachenko @trboxing @BobArum @GoldenBoyBoxing @KlimasBoxing @CarlMoretti No talks what’s so ever, I’m his US promoter. Bob knows how to get a hold of me if he wants to talk.

@Canelo vs @GGGBoxing is not done and not close to being done considering reports. I promise all the fans it will get done soon if and when @GGGBoxing agrees to the rematch.
Want to send my congrats to @Ryankingry on being named the 2017 @ESPN prospect of the year and to @GoldenBoyBoxing fighters @VergilOrtiz @OneOf1x @DiegoDeLaHoya for being named rising stars. Looking forward to big things in 2018 @danrafaelespn https://t.co/1aaj0B2abU

@AmirKingKhan happy b day to your pops. He's a great man.
@_FernandoVargas would love to sit with you and talk about putting  together a national amateur boxing tournament.

Can't wait for 2015, I will be using the influence and pressure of the fans to bring you the best fights possible. @GoldenBoyBoxing
Name 5 fighters today who are willing to risk it all in the ring.
A. Will fight anybody  B. Always exciting  C. Looked amazingly fast against 2 southpaw  D. Fights for the pride not the prize
As I was watching myself get demolished by @MannyPacquiao  I couldn't help but think about @AmirKingKhan giving Pac some serious problems.

With Crawford smiling at the end of round, expect a brutal KO
Love Crawfords body punches
Crawford is one bad man. @HBOboxing
@stevemaxboxing @CarlMoretti I like it.
Whatever happened to those fighters, when there's 10 seconds left in the round they go all out to win.

Congrats to @RealGlenTapia
@RealMiguelCotto was really impressive against Martinez, up next is Andrade and then the Siberian rocky
Thanks for that retweet @StephenEspinoza
What I'm trying to say, last week a few fighters got inducted into the HOF, and the future is already developing as we tweet.
We have @GoldenBoyBoxing 5 super bantam weights including @@diegodelahoya @El_Camaron23 @JosephDiazJr that are going to make some big noise
I also like 140 the way it's developing.
Can't wait for the revival of the heavyweight division. When my main man @BronzeBomber takes on Stivern for the @WBCSulaiman @WBCBoxing
154-160 is where it's at for the next 12 years

I only know a little bit about boxing :) and Dan knows I love him
@danrafaelespn please respect your elders. Thank you
@danrafaelespn that's what I thought
I thought I saw Fonfara  fight on ESPN in his last fight. What do you think @danrafaelespn
I'm calling it now Bernard Hopkins will School  Stevenson. @SHOsports
This should be a walk in the park for Stevenson if Fonfara really digs deep down inside he can do some damage
I told you Fonfara will get exposed
@kash007 @SHOsports no
@ErickMolinar83 @SHOsports mannnn cave :)
#StevensonFonfara @SHOsports I say someone gets exposed and looses by unanimous decision
#Lemieux Reminds me of Giorgio Campanella @SHOsports luckily I knocked him out in 2 rounds
I'm predicting KO in this next fight. @SHOsports by who? I don't know
Love watching @SHOsports should be a very interesting tough fight for both. #StevensonFonfara

Regarding all these rumors about my company and Richard Schafer, I will be setting the record straight soon.
@caneloOficial felicidades por ser campeón de la gente. Tu peleas para complacer a tu público y no por el negocio como otros boxeadores.

@EspinozaBoxing what do u think of the fight tomorrow night? People love a war and this one has bombs written all over it.
I feel it can be another DeLaHoyavsVargas @GoldenBoyBoxing #CanelovsAngulo
Who r u picking  tomorrow? #CanelovsAngulo @GoldenBoyBoxing
looking forward to being ringside tomorrow night #CaneloAngulo #MGM @GoldenBoyBoxing @SHOsports @caneloOficial #bombsaway #warriors
I had to weigh in the day of the fight because the champion Jimmi Bredahl was threatening to leave the country. I came in at 127 1/2 angry.
One day at a time. http://t.co/6YY2Vltla3
I've counted 7 jabs between both guys. Doesn't matter this is exciting.
Is it fair to say Vera needs a knockout?
I love exciting fights!!
Body shots r hurting Vera
What is Vera made of?
Chavez must put 3 4 5 punch combos, he's concentrating to much on one shot at a time.
If Chavez starts to push him back he will take over.
Good call
Now it's a 10 round fight because saludos hasn't pressured and lomachenko is not breathing heavy
As long as lomachenko keeps the fight long at distance, he will box his ears off
@ArmyXCTFCoach @HBOboxing thank u
Salido has to pressure this young inexperienced pro boxer
Fights!! @HBOboxing
Incredible how one of my boxing heroes was 72-1 before loosing to the great @SUGARRAYLEONARD  FYI
@ACE_Boxing yes :)
@danrafaelespn as owner of the company I'll sit this one out and watch on @SHOsports ppv. My CEO will be there. Hope your well.
@danrafaelespn How are you Dan?
@malevolent_mind maybe haha
Did u know? The great Julio Cesar Chavez was 89-0 before losing his first fight.
On this day the great willie pep lost to Lulu Perez 1954-02-26 his record was 183-6
@darrenor I loved fighting the best and I'm sure it would have been a war.
"Sugar" Ray Robinson received his first loss against Jake LaMotta today February 26,1943. He went on to win 90 more before having his 2nd L
Nice to be surrounded by good people. http://t.co/eOoIeNV9Nl
@Cabrera316 @danawhite close call, I've seen both fight with passion and heart.

Can anybody say "Jab" #lostart #key
Roy is great for Pascal. Not because he's going to change in one fight, but because he has Roy's fighting spirit and mentality tonight
I can't help but think that my partner @THEREALBHOP beat Pascal
Roy can't change pascals style in 1 fight, but he sure can motivate him to think he's a different and better fighter tonight. @HBOboxing
Bute doesn't look to good, but in boxing you never know what's going to happen when a fresh three minutes start.
I love fighters taking risks to be great. #ButevsPascal
@danrafaelespn read my timeline.
Should be a good fight #ButevsPascal #boxing @HBOboxing @GoldenBoyBoxing @SHOsports @trboxing
