Steve King’s hateful and racist comments. Today, I've introduced a resolution censuring him. https://t.co/MrC6GDGUFI
Day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown. On Friday, American workers received $0 pay stubs. Families are struggling to make ends meet. Bills are piling up. This has gone on for far too long. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/LxSP4NFTMW
China is preparing for the next 10, 50 years – while Trump is only concerned about the next 24-hour news cycle. The United States needs to be making long-term investments in clean energy, transportation, and advanced manufacturing. We can't fall behind. https://t.co/CLkQTMRPeN
Since Day 1 of the 116th Congress, the House passed several bills with bipartisan support to reopen the government.  How many of those bills has Mitch McConnell brought to the Senate floor? ZERO  @senatemajldr and Senate Republicans need to do their job. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/svrJdXdAwh
The President's signature campaign promise was that Mexico was going to pay for the wall. Now he's going back on his word, manufacturing a crisis, and making the American taxpayers foot the bill for an ineffective and expensive wall. Enough is enough. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/rIvW4xvS9l
Groceries. Gas. Credit card bills. Rent. Mortgage payments. School tuition. Hundreds of thousands of Americans won't be getting a paycheck today because of the #TrumpShutdown. @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr, how will they pay for these things? #EndTheShutdown

.@realDonaldTrump, @senatemajldr end the shutdown today. https://t.co/9AORVzio3V
It's outrageous that the President is considering taking money from disaster areas to fund his ineffective wall. This makes Americans less prepared and less safe. He needs to end his manufactured crisis and reopen the government. https://t.co/PsDGnemlhV
As the government shutdown enters its 20th day, Mitch McConnell continues to hold 800,000 American jobs hostage as he refuses to even consider a vote to reopen the government. It's an insult to the men and women who help run our country every day. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/DBrDvoaUGx
When the President says his shutdown is going to go on for months or even years, it’s disrespectful to American workers everywhere. We can’t let our country grind to a halt over a vanity project. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/TyrODpz8Nm
The U.S. House of Representatives must censure Rep. Steve King for his racists remarks. These remarks should also be repudiated by Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and all of Rep. King's colleagues. Support for white supremacist ideology should have no place in Congress. https://t.co/MCnIowmBkv

As the President and Republican Party drags this shutdown into its 19th day, 300 employees of FIC Elkton are still showing up to work and not getting paid. The President needs to stop putting party over country and end this shutdown today. https://t.co/mo12ozntO2
Data from the President's own Administration shows that "far greater quantities of hard drugs, such as meth, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl" are seized through ports of entry. We should be investing resources there instead of in a 5th century wall. https://t.co/Ii1tz0BuYC
President Trump’s focus should be on reopening the government as hundreds of thousands of federal workers are facing the grim reality that they won’t be receiving a paycheck this week. (3/3) #TrumpAddress

House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government last week - on Day 1 of the 116th Congress. Sen. Mitch McConnell refuses to bring the bills to a vote in the Senate. The President and Republican party are holding our country hostage. #TrumpAddress
75% of people overstay their visas. And the President is doing nothing to help with that. #TrumpAddress

House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government on Day 1 of the 116th Congress. @senatemajldr won't take up the legislation, even though the Senate unanimously passed it last month. Why is he stalling? https://t.co/ExXDccoaJ2
Right here in the Mahoning Valley, we’re seeing the impact of Trump’s callousness as he continues to drag his government shutdown into its 18th day. While bills are piling up, the men and women of FCI Elkton don't know when their next paycheck is coming. They deserve better https://t.co/WJhiNJmLfT
In our 24-hour news cycle, we can't forget about this. 14,700 GM workers lost their jobs at the end of 2018. In the start of the new year, we need to focus on manufacturing and economic policies that will work #ForThePeople. https://t.co/ZDtE8KCbjn
Even Sarah Sanders cannot justify why we need a wall. It's clear that this has never been about border security. It's about pleasing a few right-wing television and radio hosts. https://t.co/0hJhLjJ3gT
Trump's shutdown is affecting federal workers all across the United States, it's not just DC. And this Friday, hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans won't be receiving their paycheck. The Senate needs to vote on the House legislation today. https://t.co/FlRoT09Heh
House Democrats passed legislation last week to end the government shutdown, the same legislation the Senate passed unanimously just a few weeks ago. It’s time for Republicans to end their political games and reopen the government. https://t.co/gSvsnvRUTu
Our citizens are served by the men and women in our federal corrections system. They work hard in dangerous jobs. Trump’s government shutdown is terrible. And for the President to give his top people a pay raise while these workers are not getting paid is a slap in the face. https://t.co/4PBj2MTu9K

As Donald Trump continues his presidential tantrum over an ineffective and unnecessary wall, more GM jobs are being lost. He's yet to provide a real solution to bring back the jobs he's promised. We need a national manufacturing policy now. https://t.co/vGM30mrbfA
As we begin the #116thCongress, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that no American is left behind and work together to solve our nation’s problems, while at the same time preforming Congress’ Constitutional duty to act as a check on the Executive Branch. Let's get to work!

Republicans talk a big game about putting the American people first. Yet 400,000 Americans won’t be getting a paycheck this holiday season because of their shutdown — while Congressional Republicans are still paying themselves. This isn’t a party that leads, it’s a party of chaos

This morning, I spoke with GM CEO Mary Barra and expressed my frustration with their decision to close the Lordstown plant. But I emphasized that I remain focused on bringing a new product to GM Lordstown, keeping jobs in our community, and protecting American workers. https://t.co/XE08sPdl24

In a few minutes, I'll be joining my congressional colleagues @RepMarcyKaptur @RepDebDingell @RepLawrence @repsandylevin to talk about GM. Our workers deserve better.   Watch the livestream here: https://t.co/1pMAGs6hYJ
GM has a blatant disregard for workers. https://t.co/xgUYWGxi4F
Make sure you and your family have health care coverage by signing up at https://t.co/xednLAup1u. Open enrollment is happening now. The deadline is December 15. https://t.co/DTgVVEP92E
GM Lordstown employees on the company's decision to close the plant: - "I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach" - "It affects your life and family's life" - "You're going right into Christmas, you're looking for celebration, and that's not there now." https://t.co/t3SUle3hpO
$157 million. That's how much GM made off the Republican tax cuts this year. But 14,700 people were told they will not have jobs this week. It doesn't add up. It's why I've urged the @WaysMeansCmte &amp; @WaysandMeansGOP to get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/TQ7EsTrCqc
Just had a conversation with Mike Pence about GM Lordstown. I told him I want to work with this Administration to put a car back in Lordstown as soon as possible. I look forward to further discussions with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress.
GM's decision "is an attack on the American worker. Whether you're a UAW member, or a teamster, or a steelworker, or a non-union worker, it doesn't matter. This is an attack on you." - UAW Region 2B Director Rich Rankin. Watch his video here --&gt; https://t.co/pnfcMyU0fQ https://t.co/z4gNLe3gJI
The @vindicator Editorial Board is absolutely right: "We aren’t ready to throw in the towel. Hope must spring eternal for a region that has had more than its fair share of bad news." We must continue to put pressure on GM and President Trump. https://t.co/Hhz4FHuBeb
GM just got a huge tax cut to the tune of $150 million this year, and then they turn around cut 15,000 jobs and the stock price goes up six percent. That's a broken economy. https://t.co/aPzW5NexOk
It is time for Trump to put down his phone and roll up his sleeves. We need this reality show from hell to end, and a presidency to begin. Real people are being hurt out here. https://t.co/TtZZM2pbQ5
All talk. GM Lordstown’s 3rd shift was ended on Inauguration Day. He could have stepped in 2 years ago, but he's been asleep at the wheel. We need more than just words, we need action. https://t.co/OpfzrjMiu0
The President is more concerned about his golf game than the jobs of hard working Americans. When we needed his help with GM, where was he? And now they’re closing five factories. The President is disconnected from what's really happening in the economy. https://t.co/DY4LEQ8E48

Tune in 👇 https://t.co/tfuF0iExbx
On July 25, 2017, President Trump visited Youngstown, OH and said he would bring jobs back to our area. Today, GM is shutting down the Lordstown Plant and 4 more across North America - a loss of over 14,000 jobs. The President has yet to tweet about GM today. https://t.co/gKNv8ieq9N
This is absolutely the epitome of a broken economic system where the men and women here have dedicated their lives to building quality cars and are now getting slapped in the face. GM takes the money, takes the bailout, and screws the American worker. https://t.co/bfmDlj1O6T
The American people deserve to know if the tax cuts they paid for are being used to inflate corporate profits at the expense of their economic security and the survival of American workers. (2/2)
I strongly urge @WaysandMeansGOP &amp; @WaysMeansCmte to hold hearings where GM and other corporations who have laid off workers since the passage of the tax break are called to testify regarding tax breaks they received and how this money was spent. (1/2) https://t.co/M4vp0fOKgi
GM stock up 5%. There is your economy. #Rigged https://t.co/xPUfz1UBe2
My office is standing by to assist all those who are impacted by this closure. Our community has always banded together in difficult times, and this will be no different. (8/8)
Corporations like General Motors and the President himself are the only ones benefiting from this economy—an economy rigged against workers who are playing by the rules but still not getting ahead. (7/8)
That clearly is not happening. The Valley has been yearning for the Trump Administration to come here, roll up their sleeves and help us fight for this recovery. What we’ve gotten instead are broken promises and petty tweets. (6/8)
So far, President Trump has been asleep at the switch and owes this community an explanation. We tried to get his attention on this issue two years ago. He promised us that his massive corporate tax cut would lead to dramatic reinvestments in our communities. (5/8)
I implore President Trump to keep his word when he came to the Mahoning Valley last year and promised jobs were ‘all coming back. They’re all coming back. Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.’ (4/8)
Thousands of families have sacrificed to build GM into what it is today. And in return, GM has turned its back on us when we need them the most. This is a bad combination of greedy corporations and policy makers with no understanding of economic development. (3/8)
For decades, workers have devoted their lives, working day and night, to produce some of the finest cars in the country for General Motors. We fought together to keep GM afloat and the American taxpayers bailed them out when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. (2/8)
Today our generation is facing a new Black Monday in the Mahoning Valley. GM’s announcement is devastating for the men and women working at Lordstown and everyone here in the Mahoning Valley. (1/8) https://t.co/uxoF8XrMo1

Enough is enough. We must eradicate this hatred wherever it lies. It is my hope that the events of the past day and week sparks change. The rhetoric is too hot. We must take responsibility for creating a new and better country. From rancor to respect. Let's hit the reset button
It is disgusting that this kind of violence can happen anywhere in the world, let alone in a country that claims to the leader of the free world. This horrific act happened at a time when we are seeing a historic rise in anti-Semitic incidents and anti-Semitic online harassment.
My heart goes out to yet another community ripped apart by gun violence and anti-Semitic hatred. Our brothers and sisters at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh were murdered because of who they are and how they worshiped.

I’m really worried about this. The tax cuts were unfairly distributed to the top, preventing us from making critical investments and now tying our hands to be able to respond to a downturn. Policies matter. This tax cut was based on ideology and not experience or evidence. https://t.co/0AdqSoGsXk

Congress can pass my HOT CARS bill today and prevent these hot car deaths. A simple piece of tech can go a long way in saving these kids' lives. What are we waiting for? https://t.co/XFuBYxSKS0
After the President’s dangerous performance in #Helsinki and his failed attempt to "walk-back" his disgraceful comments, the last thing we need is to implement a secret security deal with Russia. Congress must know the details before anything proceeds. https://t.co/TfmYq9Vt0x
Our outrage must be met with the same level of action. This Administration must reunite every child with their parents. If not, Congress should hold them accountable. This is not a hard concept. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/nTzBzYWTJU

This is heartbreaking. My prayers go out to the family. We in Congress can do something about it. My bill the HOT CARS Act would require car companies to install inexpensive tech that would alert parents of a child left in the backseat. We must act today! https://t.co/LnZSlRdU9e
Trump’s action today with Putin was a disgraceful setback to U.S. global leadership; an insult to those serving in our intelligence agencies; and a disheartening betrayal of every servicemember defending the U.S. government’s interests against Russian government hostility. https://t.co/BUGFdR70rL

@RepDanKildee 4/4 This family separation policy is nothing more than government sanctioned child abuse. It is an American tragedy and a black eye on our democracy. We are better than this. We are bigger than this. We must strive harder to fulfill our shared values.
@RepDanKildee 3/4 Fast forward 24 hours, and my son is at the playground w/ my wife &amp; I. He sits on this play turtle &amp; all I could think of was the poor kid in Michigan whose parents are 1000s of miles away. He's sad, confused, and has no idea why he is separated from the people he loves most. https://t.co/v71vwYKwJl
2/4 My colleague, @RepDanKildee, asked what one little boy was coloring and he said "tortuga," which means "turtle" in Spanish. I teared up because that little boy was the same age as my son, Brady.
1/4 Yesterday I was in Grand Rapids, Michigan visiting with young children who were separated from their parents at the border.   At the facility, one group of kids was coloring.
I spoke to @chrislhayes last night about my visit to a facility housing separated migrant children. Hearing their stories was gut-wrenching. This is state-sanctioned child abuse. https://t.co/8ZpJQFBlTc

#OTD 54 years ago, LBJ signed the #CivilRightsAct. This bill was a monumental step towards combatting discrimination, but over half a century later there’s still more work to be done. We have to continue to call out the injustices we see every day and fight for full equality.
2/2  I thank them for their service and will continue to support them and their mission. Terrorist or aspiring terrorists will never shake us of our values.

2/2 If we want secure borders and an immigration system that actually works for America, then what we need to abolish is the Trump Administration’s broken, heartless, and divisive immigration agenda and replace it with a system that is consistent with American values.
1/2 Giving ICE a new name or giving some other agency ICE’s job will have no effect whatsoever as long as @realDonaldTrump chooses to use immigration enforcement as a means to stoke division and inflame racial and ethnic animosity. https://t.co/rB1jwVFjb6

(3/3) If he was truly interested in ushering in a more stable, peaceful world, he’d get to work with our allies to engage in diplomacy all over the globe.
(2/3) It seems the President is finding that empty bluster doesn’t work as well in diplomacy as it does on the campaign trail. The reality is, China and North Korea have his number. He’s an erratic President at a time when the United States desperately needs a steady hand.
(1/3) @realDonaldTrump's handling of disarmament talks with North Korea leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, it looks to our allies and to our adversaries that the President doesn’t know what he’s doing.

Never mind that ZTE is a company with which the NSA, FBI, and CIA all have cyber security concerns. The Pentagon even stopped selling its phones on military bases.
GM Lordstown has lost 2,700 jobs over the last 18 months &amp; hasn’t earned a single tweet from POTUS. Chinese telecom giant  ZTE, however, is getting VIP treatment from the Real Donald Trump himself who is working overtime to, in his own words, ‘get [zte] back into business, fast.’ https://t.co/Vn3HuG8anQ

On top of that, the NSA, FBI, and CIA all have cyber security concerns with ZTE. The Pentagon even stopped selling its phones in its bases. Your willingness to throw a lifeline to ZTE and China puts our national security at risk. What happened to America First?
Hey @RealDonaldTrump -- I've got 1,500 auto workers that are laid off at GM in Lordstown, OH. Not one tweet, not one comment from your office. Remember Ohio? The place you campaigned and told people how trade and China were destroying our middle class? https://t.co/eUVH45fNX7

We cannot let this opportunity slip away.  I will do everything in my power to help HomeGoods find a home here in the Mahoning Valley. https://t.co/iXUCk3P67z
Upon learning of this news, I immediately informed HomeGoods’s leadership that I want to work with them to find suitable alternative sites in our area for the thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of payroll that HomeGoods would bring to our region.
THREAD: I am very disappointed that TJX HomeGoods has felt it necessary to drop their plans to locate in Lordstown.  Throughout many conversations I have had with Lordstown officials and HomeGoods’ leadership, I have strongly supported this project since the very beginning.

3/ I am proud that my bill, the Healthy Start Reauthorization Act, supports this life-saving work.
2/ We must redouble our efforts to combat this trend by confronting bias wherever it is, and through programs like Healthy Start, which is fighting maternal and infant mortality with early prenatal care, quality services, and postpartum home visiting.
1/ Read this article. The reality is systemic bias in our healthcare system is killing African-American mothers and babies. The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world -- We can't accept that.  https://t.co/IxnEHBxVP9

It is critical that Congress and the American people be provided with a clear plan for how to work with our allies to end the Syrian civil war, remove Assad from power, and restore stability to the region.
While I feel last night’s actions were appropriate, any long-term operation must take place in consultation w/ Congress. It has been a year since Pres. Trump first struck the Assad regime, but he has yet to settle on a comprehensive Syria policy.  More:  https://t.co/F3iKwMZPrP

China, Russia, and other countries have oversaturated the global market, intentionally undermining our national manufacturing industry and defense industrial base. These tariffs brought against the worst actors will have a profound strengthening effect on America.
Implemented in a practical and measured approach, the Trump Administration's tariffs will help protect our steel and aluminum industries from decline. But we need to include exemptions for countries and allies dedicated to the same labor and environmental standards as the U.S.

3/ I urge @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans to get serious about this threat and take immediate action to safeguard our elections from foreign interference.
2/ Russia wants to show democracy cannot work, and that strongmen, oppression, and cronyism are the only paths forward. We cannot allow that. It’s not just the security of our elections at stake, but the viability of democracy itself.
1/ There is no doubt that Russia set out to, and succeeded at, meddling in our democratic process. Today’s new indictments illustrate that with startling clarity.
This is laughable. The Democratic Party will continue to fight for these young people who enrich our communities and better our nation. We believe in fairness — for DREAMers, pensioners, workers, and families everywhere. @GOP believes in their donors. https://t.co/vlZ7gkwh7o

4/4 With the business of funding the government underway, I expect the Speaker to follow his Senate colleagues' lead and immediately hold a DACA vote in the House.
3/4 But GOP leadership should be ashamed of their refusal to bring a clean DREAM Act to the Floor. They are resisting the overwhelming will of the American people and tarnishing our moral standing by threatening to break our promise to these young people.
2/4 The budget agreement includes billions of dollars more for critical defense and domestic programs that range from keeping our troops abroad equipped with the latest technology, to making sure our students can thrive and learn here at home.
1/4 This bipartisan budget agreement was far from perfect, but it represents an important step forward in breaking the gridlock that has paralyzed Congress for far too long and hurt the American people.

I've been in briefings on our long term nat'l security strategy. Challenges loom w/ China &amp; Russia. We must make investments in our military. @realDonaldTrump's thoughtful response? “I want a parade!” Mr. President, if you want a parade, pay for it yourself. https://t.co/cgjOfbNrEv

2/  It is a failure of the most basic duties Congress was elected to do – to keep the government running. I voted NO on another failed Republican attempt at governance because allowing the continued deferment of our sworn duty hurts investment in our national security...
1/ The House just passed another short term funding bill. If it feels like we’ve been here before, it’s because we have. Four times this fiscal year, to be exact. Funding the Federal government just weeks at a time cannot be the new normal.
3/ My full statement here:   https://t.co/n6uUaN0ssc

I don't understand how sabotaging one of the country's fastest growing industries -- which employs more than 260,000 people -- counts as sound economic policy.  https://t.co/TDdwaw4z1m
3/ You can read my full statement here: https://t.co/o1UsRY4Eg6
2/ The continued unpredictability of the GOP's governing, lack of prioritization of consistent funding for our country’s military and critical domestic investments, and their continued inability to bring up for a vote a bipartisan solution to protect DREAMers earned my no vote.
1/ Today I voted against the latest irresponsible stop-gap funding bill. Congress must set a budget for the United States. Instead, under GOP control, we're on our 5th CR of this fiscal year alone.
This is not sustainable. We need an economy that sustains a thriving middle class, not just the ultra wealthy. https://t.co/qsvMsOiL7r
Whether you're a Teamster or coal miner worried about losing your pension, or a DREAMer looking forward to another semester of school but facing grave uncertainty -- know that Democrats are fighting for you. #TrumpShutdown #DefendDREAMers #ProtectOurPensions https://t.co/4O02OWMwum
For generations, immigrants have enriched and renewed America with excitement and enthusiasm. Amer is doing now what our ancestors did generations ago, and we’re here for him.  https://t.co/9hj1OjcOBp
And we want to stabilize Teamster and coal miner pensions at risk of collapsing. The Republican Party has hurt all these efforts.
We want a long-term solution for CHIP and Community Health Centers – those programs save our country billions and help save countless lives.
We want a permanent solution for Dreamers – to avoid losing 800,000 promising young people who will generate over $400 billion for our economy over the next decade alone.
Looking forward to joining @kasie tonight around 8:30! We'll be discussing the #TrumpShutdown among other things.
There is bipartisan support to end this mess, strike a deal on all of our critical priorities, and reopen the government right now, but time and time again President Trump has shown that he would rather shift blame than take a position and stick to it.  https://t.co/9cbNUcHhP7
It’s impossible to negotiate with someone who can’t keep his word.  This trail of broken promises goes back 40yrs to workers and small business people who got stiffed by our President. #remeberatlanticcity https://t.co/Y6RguaRGjP
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/Dz7Xzn5mld
2/ but movements that have sprung up since the first @womensmarch like #MeToo and #TimesUp are much needed reminders of what can be accomplished when people come together to change society for the better. Thank you to all who marched across the US!
1/ I am glad to be back on the National Mall for the second annual #WomensMarch. The energy on the ground to make positive change is palpable. There's no doubt that this has been a challenging year https://t.co/uTRvhn76L6
The #TrumpShutdown… -Threatens public health &amp; safety -Disrupts the economy &amp; job creation -Blocks services &amp; investments critical to our families &amp; our communities  The American people deserve better.   CC: @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/wYyv3lmxna
3/ This is a painful and needless situation entirely of the GOP's making. I hope they come to their senses quickly and work with Democrats on a responsible path forward.
2/ Democrats remain ready to work with Republicans to create a bipartisan budget agreement that will keep the government operating, stabilize pensions on the verge of collapse, protect DREAMers, and provide funding for the opioid epidemic, CHIP, and community health centers.
1/ Republicans are choosing to use vulnerable populations as bargaining chips to play politics at the expense of those who need Congress to act. Welcome to the #TrumpShutdown.   https://t.co/IAgqm7kT6c
5/ My full statement: https://t.co/9ikJoBNfbe
4/ There is talent all across America, but investments must be made in order to harness it. I applaud eBay for recognizing this reality and committing to investing in communities like Akron &amp; Warren. Thrilled to continue to support critical public-private partnerships like these.
3/ We have the perfect opportunity right now to help rebuild and rejuvenate communities that have been struggling with the loss of manufacturing by connecting them with tech companies traditionally located on the coasts.
2/ As technology and entrepreneurship continues to form the foundation of the twenty-first century economy, it is imperative that we in government be able to answer one very important question: How do we plug every community into the global economy?
1/ I am proud that my Congressional District was selected to host the first ‘Retail Revival’ pilot partnership with eBay. https://t.co/eTPfX5qvdq
Doesn't seem like it!   https://t.co/exwd2OaRbK
Last year @realDonaldTrump said that maybe our government “needs a good shutdown.” Well, thanks to his (and Republicans) refusal to not use KIDS (DREAMers &amp; CHIP recipients) as bargaining chips, here we are — hours away from a possible government shutdown. A sad day.
4/ Republicans are choosing to play politics at the expense of those who need Congress to act. Republican leadership must come to its senses and work with Democrats to actually solve problems, not create more. My full statement: https://t.co/oeMbBuDmQt
3/ As the unified Republican government lurches from one crisis to the next, it is hardworking families, our military, and communities that suffer. This is our fourth temporary spending bill in this fiscal year.
2/ Once again, the so-called “governing” party in the House of Representatives surrendered their duty to responsibly fund the government, jeopardizing needed investment in Head Start, job training, and homeland security.
1/ I could not vote for another government funding bill that utterly fails to help Teamsters and coal miners on the verge of seeing their pensions evaporate, 800,000 DREAMers facing deportation, and 9 million children who rely on the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

"[...] if the rule is finalized, every year workers will lose $5.8 billion in tips [...] Of the $5.8 billion, nearly 80 percent—$4.6 billion—would be taken from women who are working in tipped jobs."   This is wholly unacceptable.   https://t.co/YyFh8cu72X

PSSSST. Hey — you can bring CHIP reauthorization to the floor at any time. You control the chamber. https://t.co/4prp4pvBhe
Thank you to YSU President Jim Tressel, Mercy Health Youngstown CEO Don Kline, Youngstown Mayor Jamael Tito Brown, and Jim Kinnick, Julius Oliver, Michael Hripko, Sharon Woodberry, and Charles Sasho for all your work on this.

American workers are left with the tab when China is able to skirt trade laws. We must put an end to illegal steel dumping.   #AmericaSteelStrong https://t.co/Z1jtkqv7km
5/ Every American should be angered by what I witnessed today and what individuals are experiencing every day under the Trump Administration. This fight is not over.
4/ We must do better. Not only for Amer, but for the countless other families in similar situations. For the 800,000 DREAMers who live in a state of limbo, wracked with fear and uncertainty, because of this Administration’s lack of empathy.
3/ Instead, I witnessed firsthand the destructive consequences of President Trump’s willfully negligent immigration policies. A country that punishes those who wish to contribute will not find prosperity.
2/ The Administration didn’t even give him a chance to say goodbye to his family. I accompanied Amer to his meeting this AM in the hope that what is clear to the City of Youngstown would be clear to ICE: his case deserves a day in court &amp; Amer is a valued member of our community.
1/ The arrest of Amer Othman is a shameful failure of justice. Treating an individual with no criminal record who poses zero flight risk like an animal flies in the face of American values.   https://t.co/noVQKFgXwC

2/ It is un-American. We won't stand for it. And we'll fight it every step of the way.

It is amazing what our community can accomplish when we come together.   https://t.co/1ZfYF8RP8T

Amer is a valued member of our community. Allowing our broken immigration system to tear his family apart is negligent. We must be better than this. We ARE better than this. https://t.co/bXQRa316Cx
When we think of the Cuban Missile Crisis, we tend to think of President Kennedy’s deliberative &amp; steady hand. The man currently sitting in the Oval Office is no JFK. Republicans need to stand up for the security of our global community. @realDonaldTrump is reckless beyond words. https://t.co/Ejn8HDka36
4/ Amer’s wife, his children, and the entire community of people who care about him deserve better. This a disgrace and only worsens our already broken immigration system.
3/ It was a long-standing policy at the Department of Homeland Security not to deport people who are the subject of introduced legislation. The Trump Administration’s decision to ignore this policy is what led to Amer’s deportation order.
2/ He is contributing mightily to Youngstown and our country. He does not deserve to be deported, and I am proud to have introduced a bill that, for a time, prevented his deportation.
1/ The case of Amer Othman is a tragic illustration of the failure of our immigration system and why it must be fixed. Amer has lived in this country since the age of 19, is happily married with four children, and is a successful local business owner.  https://t.co/fCqzYist5e

I fully support the FBI and its agents serving at the highest levels of law enforcement. They are protecting our nation here at home. We should never let partisan politics stand in the way of our citizens’ safety.

This tax scam is objectively bad policy. Republicans know this, but they’ve remained determined to stick hardworking people with the tab for their massive $2 trillion corporate giveaway. It is a sad day when the Congress works against the interests of the American people. https://t.co/P037WZtlUM
Disgraceful that draft-dodging @realDonaldTrump (fake bone spurs) is preventing this patriot from serving our nation’s military. No one who wants to serve our country—and meets every qualification—should ever be denied due to their gender identity. @GLADLaw https://t.co/Cp0lATHhhv
@HouseGOP It is governing malpractice. A $2 trillion giveaway to multinational corporations, while KIDS and their families await notices that the CHIP program they rely on is closing down. Don't forget this. I won't.
Affordable, quality coverage for nearly 224,000 Ohio children is at risk without a CHIP funding extension. Instead of addressing that, @HouseGOP will spend today RE-VOTING on their garbage tax scam because in their haste, the initial bill was full of mistakes. What a circus.
Perhaps @SpeakerRyan can take a break from celebrating raising taxes on hardworking Americans (so he can cut them for huge corporations) to do something about this. Democrats have been waiting...   https://t.co/cn0xT3ucd8

This secret kickback was dropped into the bill behind closed doors, in the dead of night, without any debate or discussion by Congress. This tax bill isn’t legislation so much as it is one big heist.
Every worker punching a clock, every teacher making lessons plans, every mom &amp; pop store struggling to make payroll—all are on the hook for the billions this kickback saves Donald Trump. It’s grossly unfair. It’s un-American. It’s corruption at the highest levels of government. https://t.co/h0HGCyDLvT

@NPR 3/ The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, and we are the only developed nation whose rate is on the rise.

6/ @realDonaldTrump, @SpeakerRyan, and @SenateMajLdr are all celebrating a big "win." But who won? They certainly can't look hardworking Americans in the face and say "you did." This bill is a disgrace, and they know it. They passed it anyway in the dead of night. Shame on them.
5/ It steals resources from key investments like edu, building a 21st century transportation system, and fighting the opiate addiction epidemic. It weakens our country and will make it impossible for us to grow our economy, lift wages, and secure pensions for American families.
4/ Congress should be doing everything in our power to make life easier—not harder—for the hardworking men and women of this country. This bill seems to have been written to accomplish exactly the opposite.
3/ They are prepared to blow a giant hole in our deficit, borrow huge sums from China to give tax breaks to corporations already making record profits, &amp; inflict further pain on the middle class by cutting Social Sec., Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; important programs Americans rely on.
2/ Half of all Americans and 82 million middle-class families will face a tax increase under this scam. The GOP is mortgaging away our long-term economic future for the short-term gains of a wealthy few.
1/ Now that the Senate passed this abhorrent tax legislation, members of both chambers go to a Conference Committee to hammer out a final bill. If this GOP-controlled Congress had any moral authority left, the Committee’s job would be simple: toss both bills into the dumpster. https://t.co/MhjLs14cTz
With this mess of a tax bill, the GOP is mortgaging away our economic future. They're prepared to blow a giant hole in our deficit, then inflict further pain on middle class families by cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, &amp; other programs Americans rely on.

@realDonaldTrump 5/ The American people deserve better. This is not a plan I will support. My full statement: https://t.co/EzXAWVB4FS
@realDonaldTrump 4/ These tax breaks for the 1% would blow a massive hole in our deficit &amp; mean drastic cuts to important programs for working families.
@realDonaldTrump 3/ Their plan is clear: slash rates for the wealthy who've already seen the majority of the recovery &amp; stick the middle class w/ the check.
@realDonaldTrump 2/ Instead of fixing our broken tax system their idea of reform relies on the same trickle-down policies that's failed families for decades.
1/ @realDonaldTrump &amp; GOP leaders long-awaited tax plan falls far short of the meaningful reform hardworking Americans need &amp; deserve.
Running into the @MineWorkers always brightens my day. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/RUZ8DRAwVH

I am celebrating passage of HOT CARS language in the House which would get this tech into more cars. I urge the Senate to do the same.
These deaths can be prevented w/ simple tech that already exists in the market. That is why this #ChildPassengerSafetyWeek...
So far in 2017, 39 kids have died in hot cars – surpassing the annual average of 37. This can happen in temperatures as low as 60 degrees.

GOP healthcare plan: sticking it to sick people (and the elderly, and women, and the disadvantaged, etc.)
#GrahamCassidy = huge premium hikes for people with pre-existing conditions.
Rooting for my colleagues, @SenateDems, as they fight off the GOP from their latest effort to pass Trumpcare. #HoldTheFloor #DefendTheACA

@RepRoKhanna Under the #GAINAct a family who makes up to $75K a year and has 3 or more kids could receive a $12,000 tax credit.

5/ I am proud to lead this effort w/ @janschakowsky &amp; @RepPeteKing.  A step in the right direction that will help save lives.
4/ This technology is already in the marketplace - now car manufacturers &amp; NHSTA will be required to act to help save the lives of children.
3/ Congress passed the Self Drive Act, including my Hot Cars Act, which requires every car to be equipped w/ a rear seat child alert system.
2/ But we have no requirement for cars to have a simple feature that will help save the lives of children across the country, until now.
1/ On average 37 children die a year from heat-related deaths after being trapped in vehicle. These deaths can be avoided w/ simple alerts.
@POTUS 5/ It is a moral imperative: We must #DefendDACA
@POTUS 4/ Congressional leadership must move to bring up legislation to ensure that over 800,000 young people don't have their futures ripped away.
3/ It is unconscionable that @POTUS would devastate the futures of individuals who want to contribute to the country they know and love.
2/ Will force people back to the shadows after they voluntarily registered w/ the gov to serve in our military, attend college, &amp; pay taxes.
1/ Pres. Trump’s heartless decision go after 800,000 young people is a betrayal of his promise to respond ‘with great heart’ to this issue.
...that with the stroke of a pen @realDonaldTrump will jeopardize the futures of their own family, and thousands of DREAMers. #DefendDACA

It is time that our tax reform stands and works for everyone, not just those at the top.
I will not support a tax plan that only consists of tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of the middle class &amp; does not grow the economy.
Meaningful reform must include a $ 1 trillion expansion of the earned income tax credit &amp; promoting the middle class.
Any plan must include the closing of special interest &amp; corporate loopholes to prevent companies from avoiding taxes.
While also making small businesses more competitive and promoting job growth, and ensuring large corporations are paying their fair share.
Shifting the tax burden from the corporate rate onto increased capital gains &amp; dividends would hold corporations &amp; shareholders accountable
While small businesses who are the engines of economic growth &amp; job creation &amp; can’t afford armies of accountants are paying higher rates.
Most corporations use their attorneys to find loopholes to pay an effective rate of 18.6 %
Our system incentivizes corporations to seek loopholes &amp; transfer their income &amp; profits overseas to avoid investing in America
Our corporate tax rate favors large corporations &amp; creates a system that gives corporate America an unfair advantage over small businesses.
GOP thinks our problems can be solved by cutting taxes for the one %, &amp; their wealth trickling down to the rest of America. It hasn’t worked
We need to transform our tax system, so that every American is paying their fair share. Need to alleviate the everyday stresses of  families

@realDonaldTrump The President's baseless attacks on the integrity of journalists &amp; the news media must stop. My full statement here: https://t.co/RAsjtREWcz
A free press gives voice to a free people. If @realDonaldTrump doesn't like the free press, what would he have in its place?
And more time talking about crowd sizes than the brave servicemembers that just yesterday he announced will soon be in harms way again.
The President spends more time attacking our free press than he does the white supremacists who committed an act of domestic terror.
Our servicemembers &amp; their families sacrifice so much for our nation. We stand with you during this difficult time, grateful for all you do.

America: @SenateGOP is about to vote in favor of a bill they're currently slamming on live TV.
That is, *shockingly*, not in line with @realDonaldTrump's promises to expand coverage &amp; lower premiums.

Sitting back and not working in a bipartisan manner to continue to expand coverage is reckless &amp; harmful. Dems are waiting.
This is a concerning attitude. This isn't a game to score political points, it's about expanding and improving coverage.
Regarding the President's recent " let the ACA fail, I won't own it" comment: https://t.co/9Re7pj9wHU
@POTUS The President &amp; Congressional Republicans should be looking for ways to work with Dems to continue to expand coverage for all. We're waiting

President Trump's decision to back out of the #ParisAgreement impedes this effort &amp; will only inflict more and further suffering.
We need to build an economy of the future that has a place for everyone, not demagogue about going back, which isn't possible.
Lots of the jobs we've lost aren't coming back. We can't lie to people. Those struggling need our help, not false promises.
I've lived in the Valley my whole life.  Have watched a lot of false promises. Manufacturing in renewables = great opportunity for workers.
@realDonaldTrump @SolarFlexRack What about those companies? Those employees? Doesn't fit your narrative I guess.
@realDonaldTrump @SolarFlexRack (leading solar ground mount racking system 4 commercial + utility solar industry)
Hey @realDonaldTrump pulling out of the #ParisAgreement doesn't help Youngstown business like @SolarFlexRack.
.@POTUS don't use the people of Youngstown as your pathetic excuse for this disgrace of an action. All Americans &amp; the world deserve better.
.@POTUS's decision to back out is a decision to stick our heads in the sand and miss a huge opportunity to help our people. This isn't right

@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @StateDept @HUDgov @USDOT The list goes on. Lots of valuable, effective programs on the chopping block to finance massive tax breaks for the wealthy. What a joke.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @StateDept @HUDgov $499 million cut to @USDOT — TIGER grants will be no more. Underscores Trump's status as an "infrastructure President."
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @StateDept @HUDgov Good to see the Administration taking a stand against the National Wildlife Refuge Fund. Those critters have had a free ride long enough.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @StateDept $4.123 billion cut from @HUDgov Ben Carson is going to have a lot of free time on his (gifted) hands.
@realDonaldTrump @DHSgov $1.59 billion cut to @StateDept, USAID, and Treasury. No more Green Climate Fund and Global Climate Change Initiative. See tweet above.
@realDonaldTrump $235 million cut to @DHSgov = no more Flood Hazard Mapping &amp; Risk Analysis Program. Floods aren't scary when you live in a skyscraper.
@realDonaldTrump HHS — $4.8 billion cut to Health Professions &amp; Nursing Training Programs, because we all want medical professionals with less training.
The more you learn about @realDonaldTrump’s #TrumpBudget, the worse it gets. Brazen cuts at every turn.
Important and beautiful words from @MayorLandrieu. https://t.co/AdHjvtVeUD
@PaulinaTwiggs @FamiliesUSA Yes! My mistake.
@FamiliesUSA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Veterans have sacrificed enough for our country. Threatening their healthcare is no way to repay their service. We owe them better.
@FamiliesUSA @realDonaldTrump If @POTUS really cares about vets like he says he does, he must recognize the importance of Medicaid in providing needed healthcare to them.
@FamiliesUSA That is roughly 1 in 10 vets who would have their coverage put at risk by @realDonaldTrump's proposed cuts, that he once promised against.
According to @FamiliesUSA, some 1.75 million veterans rely on Medicare in some form, including 71,000 in Ohio alone.
In addition to being bad for all Americans, the #TrumpBudget is especially bad for our veterans.

Tune into @PowerLunch on @CNBC at 2 pm! I'll be on discussing my bipartisan legislation to establish US Cheif Manufacturing Officer.
That's odd, @realDonaldTrump seemed to love leaks when they were targeting his political opponents during the election. https://t.co/mwDzUDsBfr
If we move towards a #GreenEnergy economy, not only will we save the environment for our kids, we'll initiate a manufacturing renaissance.
The US needs to #GetWired. Every town in 2017 America should be outfitted for high speed broadband. It's an economic necessity.
We need to rebuild our country, so let's do it in a way that lifts people up -- construction workers, tradesman &amp; women.
That's why I'm asking "what is America 2.0?" How can government respond to and facilitate a new tech jobs revolution?
We have to talk about automation -- as exciting, new technologies emerge, we must be prepared for what this means for the workforce.
Too many Americans are putting in long hours, working hard, and not seeing an increase in pay as cost of living goes up.
Tune in to @cspan for my kickoff "America 2.0" special order!
...Finally, they should care about the little guy. You campaigned for them, Mr. Pres! Show you listened &amp; appoint someone qualified plz.
...they should understand that workers are people, not pawns you should celebrate replacing w/ machines...
...they should NOT have a history of scamming workers out of said overtime pay (Looking at you, Mr. Puzder)...
...they should support President Obama's overtime rule. It's fair, and makes sense...
...they should support a meaningful increase to the minimum wage. Americans deserve a raise! They don't all make millions like you...
Puzder was unqualified &amp; cared little for the American worker. His withdraw is welcomed news. Now, @POTUS, a tip for your next pick... https://t.co/AMjXbXQtqe

@johnabooth good catch, quick thumbs!
@DonnaVishio @JordanUhl powerful image. Thanks for sharing.
Many people in similar areas voted for you, Mr. President. They believed you when you said you cared. Do something to prove them right.
Seriously. People in Flint still can't drink out of their taps, but the President wants to throw $20 billion at a wall that won't work. Sad!
I agree 100%. These allegations are extremely serious. If true, he should resign or be fired immediately. https://t.co/SktbqDw9mG
