@misterOrange__ That was an extremely tough show
@3elevenUnity @doug311allen Investigate and vote, call it fair play, I‚Äôll shut up hehe
@3elevenUnity @doug311allen Saying something about someone is a lot different than being accused of a sex crime, where the victim is 100% sure it was him

@CubToABear Illuminatus trilogy
@311cruisers I got this
@consequence @RealTenaciousD @jackblack @foofighters Fuck yeah
@jsram311 What a strange world we do and don‚Äôt live in
@_richsady Changed my life more than I‚Äôll ever know #illuminatustrilogy
@omaha_stylee_ @311cruisers It‚Äôs brutal
@bigfraiz @311 @NickHexum I wish
@jwolsen78 No, but I need a pick me up for sure
@3elevenUnity @omaha_stylee_ And that‚Äôs your opinion, which I am not at odds with, cause....it‚Äôs an opinion
@_richsady Robert Anton Wilson
@3elevenUnity @omaha_stylee_ The national bar association has something to say about it, too, how blind might that organization be?
@3elevenUnity @omaha_stylee_ There‚Äôs all kinds of ways to fight
@omaha_stylee_ @3elevenUnity No, I was watching and reacting to what I saw, judge K was flustered and aggressive...acts of the seemingly guilty, just an opinion like I said
@rhythmicalexile @ThatEricAlper @nbcsnl I would die
@3elevenUnity It‚Äôs (as in it was) a tweet, speaking my mind is all I did
@3elevenUnity Didn‚Äôt declare that, homey, I said seemed guilty, you gotta trust your instincts, we told you that already
@DustinBlaine16 Fuck no
@3elevenUnity Don‚Äôt doubt my intelligence because I have a different point of view, I would not do the same to you
@3elevenUnity ‚ÄúSounds guilty‚Äù not anything but an opinion, doubt my intelligence, I thought you knew respect
@3elevenUnity @Gargugi @Mykdee311 @UmbilicalMoon Let‚Äôs get evidence #imwiththat
@Mort11 I bow to you
@ThatEricAlper Bucketlist for my band, if we have to setup in the audience we‚Äôre gonna play .@nbcsnl

@GaviBoiii @BassPlayerNow Best company ever
@jimschmidt08 That‚Äôs a bold and manipulating statement
@scottEweinberg Sounds fun
@HopButcher @theopenbottleco Double grid in my chalice
@Mykdee311 I heard that
@RossLogic That was awesome
@UmbilicalMoon I see that
@MikeStylianou That sounds expensive
@MikeStylianou All I ever wanted was over two hundy

@MikeStylianou Crap
@btravis311 Hehe different guy #youfunny
@aroffutt @311 I wouldn‚Äôt hear it, hehe
@BonnieLvs311 Totally
@ean0125 I agree
@Sparkola24 It‚Äôs terribly interesting political theater, on the sad side, I‚Äôm no judge, but his beginning was loud and seemingly defensive
@BassPlayerNow King of kings
Here it comes
@BassPlayerNow Bow down
@MJN91075 Hehe, that could be bad or good
@311Cutie Hell yeah
@TonesOfMusic Hehe
@ASG0987654321 Pretty brutal
@MikeStylianou No, just the tone he was giving sounded like defensive...but I‚Äôm a sucker for a good Mom story
Brett sounds guilty as hell by his tone alone, just my opinion
@HarryLapham @mary311forU @311 Wife wants me to cut my mop
