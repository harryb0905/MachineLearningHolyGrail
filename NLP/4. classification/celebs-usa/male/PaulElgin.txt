These people trying to turn Rosanne’s clearly racist tweet into a political discussion &amp; trying to justify it by saying it was a “mishap in bad taste” are disgusting. It was purely a racially charged comment, and not her 1st. Anything to avoid the obvious I guess smh #RosanneBarr
@TrumpsTime1 @PrellJames @RiseUP_NY @therealroseanne It was a racist, bigoted comment. The people bashing Trump aren’t bashing him because of his race, they’re bashing them because of his policies, lies &amp; deceit, which is a different discussion. The fact that you can’t or refuse make this simple distinction is even scarier. Wow.

@UTHornsRawk I agree 100%.
@DeepSouthProud Agreed
@UTHornsRawk Yes that’s what I was told.. if I could edit my original tweet I would, I was going off of what one of the police officials said on tv, that they were initially investigating them as a hate crime because the first 2 victims were black.
Nothing is more relaxing than the sound the Cash app makes when you receive a payment #CashApp #Chhhinnng

@ProvenLoyalty no loyalty, unless you wear a mask.
@ProvenLoyalty wow! i hadn't heard that one yet...
@ProvenLoyalty Right! &amp; That's my point about Fisher. Everyone was caught up on is stats, I was caught up on his leadership.
@ProvenLoyalty I know, but why do you think we were trying to acquire Sessions? To get rid of Fisher, which I disagreed with...
@ProvenLoyalty it all started with Derek Fisher. That's the part I didnt like.
@ProvenLoyalty don't remind me of that trade lol smh. Still aint happy about it
Sean Peyton deserves his punishment. How u gon' TRY to injure players tho? &amp; Pay 'em extra to do it?? smh
@ProvenLoyalty YES it was lol!! they didn't trade that dude for shit smh haha

@KS_Honey00 Yep!
@KS_Honey00 remember, I hope your right! lol, Lakers all day. Im just not sold on it now. So we will see!
@KS_Honey00 Hill avg 5ppg 4 his career?? NOT impressive 2 me,Sessions is aiight. Fisher brings more than #'s. But yes can agree to disagree!
@KS_Honey00 Clutch shots can win championships. It is what it is, &amp; U cant tell me Ramon Sessions is a better option lol.Pass! Still #Lakers
@KS_Honey00 "a few clutch shots" is all it takes in the playoffs lol.Yea it isnt his best season,but 2 much experience 2 let go I think.
@KS_Honey00 its not about the season. Its about the playoffs. That's where Fisher has always stepped up &amp; showed leadership, consistency.
@whitgam912 LOL!!!
How we gon' trade Derek Fisher tho?? proven champion? Been in LA 99% of his career? 5 rings w/ Kobe?? smfh

To Developers: Easy site / app navigation & functionality is equally as important as C.R.A.P application & site layout.

@OfficiallyIce askin my followers' opinions on some music ish.. Chime in if ya feel like it. Gatherin all perspectives..
@ProvenLoyalty Understood.  So would you put Nas & Lil Wayne on the same level of greatness?
Next question: What should determine a "great" rap artist: Lyrical talent or brand / influence?
@ProvenLoyalty you do have a point!
@ProvenLoyalty right. Now Diddy just did win an Oscar tho..pretty big accomplishment
@dannydollarsign yessir.. wonder which line sold more..ima research that
@dannydollarsign TRUTH!!!

Athleticism is on a whole new level now. #NBA
Magic, KAJ & Worthy were great , but there were no Durant's, Howards & Lebrons in the 80's
In my opinion, Kobe is the greatest Laker b/c he accomplished what he has accomplished considering the level of talent in this generation
@Charod are you in LA?
I agree. Stats don't lie “@aihsat: @PaulElgin Yes, he is.”
Is Kobe the greatest Laker ever?
Because sometimes, great teams have bad games. Its rare, but it happens.
Do you believe that its always the best team that wins the Superbowl? Who is the best team in your opinions?
@SEA_Awards no prob!
@GuessImLucky DM
This would be dope if it happens --&gt; http://t.co/heMhNcIZ
@MissAmeyah LOL you'll get there!

aiight this is a lil creepy...
Congrats #Giants!! At least the #Niners didn't lose for nothing now...
NOWWW we gotta SuperBowl....
He was supposed to take a knee at the 1 yrd line. So the Giants cld run down the clock n kick a GW field goal. thats why he did that
that was the weirdest touchdown play ....
I don't think using the time out instead of the 5yrd penalty in this situation was worth it..
wow. another field goal smh..
That Acura 's a beast tho...
POW!!!
Coughlin REALLY be pissed at his team when they eff up lmao..he be havin that "if yall nukkas don't quit f**kin up" look on his face
Uh oh....
@USAFLuva LOL aiight I'll look for it

@DonnaHollywoOd you worked that game?
For those just tuning in: Its 10-9 Patriots at the half of SuperWack XLVI
@zendaj nope!
@zendaj exactly! Im 'bout to turn of the "SuperWack" n go try to find an NBA game to watch smh
I'm STILL heated off that 49er fumble 2 wks ago in overtime...NOO I aint gettin over it
a 96 yrd TD drive w/ less than 2 minutes left in the half in a Superbowl is pretty impressive tho. #ButIStillHateThePatriots
This feels more like a week #7 game .. smh #Superbowl
This game is missin the "Superbowl" energy. And so are the commercials smh.
aye.... they need to be careful with #75 Wilford on the Patriots...he's expecting
@iMassageByReci lol, so they r playin on the field of my #1 team (Colts), & my #2 team lost 2 wks ago (Niners), so i really DC who wins lol

And in boxing , ill take a boxer over a fighter anyday. In the welterweight division anyway.
The fight been talked abt 4 2 long & will end up nothin like what ppl expect. Barring somethin unconventional, it w/b a boxer vs a fighter
Sad part is, it will be a boring fight. Pac's aggression will be countered by May's defense. 12 rd fight, May by decision.
To be the best u gotta beat the best. Mayweather is the best of his generation but Pac is dope. Just whoop em n keep it pushin May!!
*fight
If Pac n Mayweather dont fight in 2012 , i dont wanna see the right anymore @FloydMayweather
My picks still remain... Niners vs Patriots Superbowl

@twitt863 yep I do know this! And I also know that ONE fight can change a boxer. Not sayin it will happen w/ May, but just sayin u never kno
@twitt863 oh there aint no doubt may got the skills. Im just concerned about his inactivity. Pac dont wait for ring rust to subside
@twitt863 emotionally i feel u & im May all the way but as a 20 yr boxing fan trust, may needs another fight first. Pac is FAST
@GlamCouturemag gimme the link or the title to the you tube vid
May needs 1 maybe 2 mre fights under his belt b4 pac.he looked a lil rusty b/was gettin his stride ..Until he caught by an 8-head 2 the lips
This was a classic example of experience vs non experience. Pac woulda neva did that. Surprised Mosely did if yall remember ...
@GlamCouturemag yes he did! He said "fight!" . And mayweather came in w/ his guard up. Ortiz was still tryna be friends #inexperience
But now as a boxing fan i wanted to see more.. Even tho it was obvious FM was gonna win .. He coulda let homie put up his gloves..
Look Mayweather coulda waited 4 Ortiz to put his guard up ..But why? To be nice? Ortiz just head butted em n busted his lip bein dirty #pass
Aiight here's  thing... Ortiz gonna purposely try to head butt FM cuz he realize he cant hit em.Then wanna b friends after? Left-right done.
@mz_frenchie hey wassup!
@MADDivaMakeup if it isnt a matter of wanting to sleep around w/ different ppl, then the relationship comittment shouldn't be a problem.

@Nulife1221 true that , thank u & appreciate the talk / perspective ! Have a good night !
@FarrahFranklin I'm maintainin how's central Cali?
@DopeGirlJin I always do. That's the prob I think. I leave myself exposed because I go hard 4 the ones I "think" are right for me
@cakezilla noooo LOL! I'm sayin u look more like Z than she does

@cakezilla default pic = Zoe
“@Nulife1221: @PaulElgin people need to take a chance, but the real ones are so guarded and the fake ones so outgoing.”
@Nulife1221 WOW. Ain't THAT the truth!!
@claudiajordan if they're called "PopChips", then there's definitely crack in 'em
@Nulife1221 so now ur talking about perception & pre-conceived notions. What ever happened to takin a chance?
@Nulife1221 question becomes , if there's no sex appeal / fun, how far do u take it if that's all u really wanted to begin with?
@Nulife1221 of course! But how about the ones that are lookin to get over & front like it's more than what it is? That I have a prob with
@FarrahFranklin lmao!!! #throwback
@dannydollarsign I know homie , sorry we've both been thru that.
@Nulife1221 seems like in #2011 all a woman wants its fun , sex appeal & a fling. But nothing of substance that will help shape her future
@Nulife1221 & that's dope & I can feel that. But my ? Is, seriously, how many women nowadays really want that ? Sensitivity , concern, love
@dannydollarsign yeah , u couldn't be more on point. & w/o beatin around the bush u know what I'm talkin bout n I appreciate what u sayin
@Nulife1221 oh really? So explain how you see it as a -
@dannydollarsign word. & that's a cryin shame. But hard 2 believe sometimes cuz I see / know 2 many couple makin it happen out here in Cali
I'm just concerned about our generation.The dude who takes care of his girl who @ 1 time was labeled "A REAL MAN" is now labeled as a trick
Before ima designer / developer / entrepreneur , ima human being & a man. Shit happens & I ain't afraid to talk about it
And I didnt say that 2 get a ganga replies sayin "it's a plus!" . I lost someone recently that I loved & I think that had alot 2 do w/ it
Growing up w/ 2 sisters has made me more sensitive&more accommodating to a woman than MAYBE normal 4 a man. Tryna decipher if thats a + or -
@malak74 so it IS a social network. I knew it!! Google tryna be slick lol
@RosetteLuve trying to reply to you by direct message but you're not following me

@DopeGirlJin EXACTLY!!
Cell Phones, Computers, iPads.. all things we're conditioned to believe we can't live without... as if the (cont) http://tl.gd/bk6qck
HUNGER shouldn't just consist of a quest for food. Knowledge, understanding, & peace can fill you up too!
@iBeJayStokes reading between the lines...brings a WHOLEEE new definition to "stay in ya lane" doesn't it? lol
Ever wonder how babies can find hapiness in the simplest things? Its b/c their minds are unexposed. So as adults, are we OVEREXPOSED??
@iBeJayStokes now THAT's some TRUTH right there!!!
@MADDivaMakeup thank you!
FRUSTRATION is just a miscomprehended emotion.The sooner you can decipher where ur frustrations REALLY come from, the less often you will be
To succumb to the distractions of matrix is to cheat yourself of the opportunity to TRULY LIVE.If u know something isn't right,INVESTIGATE!!
Never condemn those who dont know the truth. Have compassion 4 them& enlighten them.Its not their fault.B/C at one point,you were blind too.
Twitter is full of FOLLOWERS. My question is, how many LEADERS do we have on here?
Think about it, we've been conditioned to think being a "follower" (ALL puns intended) is cool.
When ppl get turned off by true conversation,cliches&quotes,its b/c the truth is "boring" & the matrix is #winning.Being a sheep is popular
Do you understand how different our society would be if we actually LIVED by the cliches & quotes we post on Facbook & Twitter? That my goal
PHILOSOPHY. INSPIRATION. VISION. IMAGE. VOICE. The principles I live by. The Paul Elgin Brand.
I think this is why I invest in ppl i care about so much b/c i don't think its fair that if im fortunate enough to make it , my ppl cant
To me a part of being successful is ensuring those close to me are successful as well. Being at the top alone is boring.

@taiphillips the COMEDY!!! Lmaooo
Time for me to get on a plane... What should my destination be?
@IAmDayeezy yeah true! And of course she was guilty. Smh
@ItsMe_Lorenzo the death penalty. The burden of proof is too high when u go for murder 1. They should have focused on the lesser charges .
@ItsMe_Lorenzo which as prosecutors should have been the main strategy going in. They would have got a conviction if they hadn't gone after&gt;
@IAmDayeezy yeah that's true too. But if Casey was black I don't think it woulda made a difference
And a Family by the name of "The Anthony's" who are remarkable liars & incredibly dysfunctional #caseyanthonyverdict
I don't this had anything to do w/ race, but everything to do w/ a poorly prepared case by the prosecution #caseyanthonyverdict
And this whole "if Casey was black thing"... Let's not forget OJ got of scott-free of 1st Degree murder & last time I checked he was black
@CMKdesigns lmfao

@ALPAPERS I can dig it. I think Jay is a little more clever but Nas is a technician with the bars. & a better storyteller too
@Frojack exactly! B/c of producers & album sales, Nas will never get the credit he deserves as a lyricist.
@richNyunglady http://t.co/bufzdZ8
A part of being successful is seeing yourself reaching your goal. If u can't visualize yourself @ the top , it will never seem realistic.
Oh, btw, I do graphics & websites http://t.co/bufzdZ8

@CMKdesigns DM
Instead of complaining about the "haters", some ppl need to see if in fact they are their OWN worst enemy.
The real reason why a lot of ppl aren't successful, is not because of talent; but b/c of their attitude & work ethic.
I'm in competition with myself, because I'm the only person that can stop me.

Television should be for entertainment, not guidance.

Reality TV is NOT Reality. #justsayin

lmao @ Hell Date
@Bird_E see & im cool with that philosophy.But ppl should just say "we're datin"& leave it at that instead of callin it an open relationship
@taiphillips you would think right?? lol
@Bird_E LOL #justsayin
@taiphillips lol! Right, and in my opinion a "relationship" is open for no-one but the one you're with. Maybe I'm just too old school lol
@Bird_E  It works for a lot! lol. My thing is just call it what it really is, which is a "fucking-ship" @taiphillips
The term "open relationship" is an oxymoron and makes no sense to me. You're either in a relationship or you're not.
@jasonrherrera exactly my point! JT is killer right now behind the arc..Nick was more clutch tho i think...
@aceronegro riiight! Didn't even think about Miller....

@TICALifornia to him, that's nothing. His ministries & radio show are estimated to be worth over $100 Million. That's what I meant.
@MrsLavish that is VERY true too! He had to have 'calculated' that loss of followers too you would think..but (cont) http://tl.gd/ajugju

@TWCableHelp DM
@ProvenLoyalty what was his statement? We could seriously use him
@ProvenLoyalty that's a hard pill for me to swallow considering ima #lakers fan, but you're right
@dannydollarsign couldn't have been said any better.
Dear Time Warner Cable & Internet Services: GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!! Thanks - The #WestLA residents
@PrincessTamyka yep,  it's their time
#Random when u tweet, ur basically talkin to urself, until hopefully someone comes along n responds. If u think abt it, that's pretty sad
It is officially a changing of the guard in the NBA.
RT @cheriejohnson75 Check out my monthly article "Cherry Picking" Download current issue for free!! http://www.glamcouturemag.com/
ABC's killin me with these damn commercials
When buster Douglas knocked out mike Tyson i was set back for a cool min....about 30 mins. Then I was over it. Sports don't rule my life
@simoulah well, he didn't say that, but when he was asked if it was his last game, he ignored the question, then finally vaguely answered it
@SAMUELLJAPPIN lol right! But we also have 16 rings. So like i said, you win some, you lose some!
PHILS COMIN BACKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LMAO the Lakers slander does not phase me! All this hate, ill be over it in about an hour or 2, trust! It's a sport. U win some, u lose some
but im still #LAKERSSSSS for life boy!!
I usually go for the team that beat mine, unless its the Celtics, so I gotta go for Dallas at this point. I like OKC too tho.
Happy for Dirk tho, he deserves another chance at a ring.
LMAO RT @Maddivamakeup Was that your request to get traded @andrewbynum? Lol!
@jayrock Thunder
@Soulful1 right lol
If I was Kobe, i'd just take every shot from here on out. practice my 3 pt shooting..i mean , why not?
much as i hate to say, @eleven8 's avatar is correct. But right about now, it should have the "trust" part removed
We need to just quit if we gonna act classless like this. This is ridiculous.
See, now we look like some suckas. This aint a good look....
What's pissin me off is Dallas is about to get scraped in the next round. So we got swept for nothin. At least go on 2 win the ring Mavs smh
That's just embarrassing LMAO
So far, I've counted 5 opportunities for us to capitalize on Dallas miscue's & cut into the lead. We've taken advantage of 2. #notgoodenough
Well, i guess we're gonna lose. smh.
I'll know by halftime if we're gonna win this game. Not by the score, but by how we're playin.
Wack fight. Pac not at his best, Mosley scared to throw / fight. Disappointed.
Mosley just don't wanna fight.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAY!! THAT WAS NOT A KNOCK DOWN!!!
Yeah, id be boo-in too. Pacman doesn't look as sharp as usual, but the prob is Shane just ain't willing to fight this dude. #SHAMEMosley
Mosley's fightin wayyy too cautious. If you gonna try to beat Pacman you gotta be willing to trade punches
Here we goooo!!!!
Fight Time...Lets Gooo!!!
@joeposa i think you may be right.. that didnt look right AT ALL...
1. That was NASTY. 2. Rondo's done for at LEAST the rest of this series
@KS_Honey00 he just said that he thinks the Lakers will come out & play better on Sunday & get a win. I was like..cool! lol
Don't know why but I always feel better after Phil talks at the podium after a Laker loss. If he ain't panicking, then I'm not lol #Lakers
Its a wrap.
What's up with Pau Gasol? Somethin aint right with that dude...beyond his play. His head ain't been in the game
WOW Phil Jackson poppin dudes in the chest now?? Yeah, we need to get it together #Lakers
@SoCalVixen LOL!!! I like that..
Sometimes I wish I really was born yesterday.
Having great instincts can definitely work 4 u. But sometimes it wks against u. Pickin up on everything sometimes doesnt do well 4 ur mood.
RT @CallMeBaybee Either you do or you don't .. "trying" is for the weak
Not good.
