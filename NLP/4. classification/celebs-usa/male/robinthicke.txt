@MistisaB always!
@ur_upgrade too much fun
@TheInfamousE I should've known from "don't try cause it ain't me"... that it IS you. you gotta change it up and spread love and kindness
@TheInfamousE U can't possibly be happily married the way u end an argument. My wife woulda gone crazy if I pull the shit u try to pull.haha
@mekabuck I just got asked by a bunch of people to grow it back. They liked it better at way. Isn't life crazy. Cant please everyone...
@TheInfamousE Would have never known by your point of view. That explains a lot. I will just say I'm sorry
@hornynkotbfan deal
@RoxanneDawn @TheDailyLove well said.But I love people and I don't like to give up on them.Mostpeople just need a little love and attention
@horny4joemac @TheInfamousE apparently all u have to do is be heartless, offensive and inconsiderate to get my attention.
@I_am_April @Monee1913Wow The funny thing is... I'm getting death threats from a white guy who looks like the lead singer of Metallica.
@madisonblueeyes Hahahaha. The most confused people are the one's who need the most love and attention. I'm doing God's work. hahahahahahaha
@1criley sorry. shit got serious. i love a good fight for righteousness! stay tuned for love. coming soon
@joejpaige @TheInfamousE made up? she sounds like a terrible date!
@TheInfamousE The more u respond the more I know I will creep into your dreams. Hahahaha. You're fucked!!!
@OMGitsMerita @Silly_Lilly_ I am bored but these are important convo's that most people are afraid of! Let's talk about it!
@mkabobo happy Bay luv!
@TheInfamousE that is what I was going for.I just wanted to look good for my fans.You win.Winner!Sleep well and dream of a sexy white man.
@persi35 @Langston_HersI of course its me
@Langston_Hers Are u serious? U are more stubborn than my Mother. U don't know Love and kindness when it's kissing you right on the cheek?
@Langston_Hers so does anyone with a heart. And I am trying to change the world around me.
@TheInfamousE There is nothing nameless or faceless about you. you are a human being and I respect u as much as my Mother or Father.
@Langston_HersI would love to hear your story and find out why you hate me so much.There are so many evil people in the world and u pick me.
@TheInfamousE That's a dis on MJB? u must be fuckin crazy? CHANGED CULTURE!!! Go hate on someone else. I'm getting nowhere with u.
@Langston_Hers WOW at that point. You have never listened to my music, my interviews, or given me a chance. I hope you find happiness.
@TheInfamousE JUst for the record. why don't you quote this supposed slighting of Mary J Blige while you spread it. Otherwise retract.
@Langston_Hers I agree. Let's fight for their acknowledgment instead of tear down others. Let's fight for a fair world.Not a more angry one.
@TheInfamousEHave u followed the political convo I have been having with this person.Simple- minded questions deserve simple- minded answers
@TheInfamousE Wow. u are awful opinionated to have no facts to base it on. keep spreading lies. makes me sound dangerous. I love it. hahah
@shontellxoxo @toky0_martian I will kill myself the day we are not together. Be sure of that. She's the best thing that ever happened to me.
@TheInfamousE Do u have a degree in NBH... Natural Born Hater???
@TheInfamousE really??? you are making shit up. I worship MJB. She is also a close friend. Now Vibe... that's another convo all together.
@toky0_martian hahahaha
@joejpaige That is correct in most circumstances. But i've been with a black woman for 18 years. I've never dated a white woman.
@TheInfamousE You are upset cause I said I have a black wife. what is wrong with that?
@TheInfamousE What MJB comment? u got me interested
@jchelms album came out a week ago homie!
@toky0_martian If u give me 10 million you can have her. hahahahahahahahahahahah
@Mike_Shelton did I miss the point? is your wife black?
@Mike_Shelton No white person shares the same daily grind as a black person in America. It's a mathematical impossibility.
@Mike_Shelton @heathershelton Happy Bday. hope you have a special day!
@Mike_Shelton you're gonna have to take credit for it. Otherwise why the fuck would I do it? hahaha
@Mike_Shelton how bout I tweet it. what's her name
@uneekariel @DJMoonDawg Funny shit was when I looked at the pic. u were fuckin right. Im embarrassed for resembling Simon Cowell. HAHA
@30somethingirl thank u for not being wack. Most of my family is  racist. My grandfathers were racist. It's the American way.
@uneekariel @DJMoonDawg @WGCI That was a terrible pic though. why am I standing like that. weird
@uneekariel @DJMoonDawg @WGCI Ok dog. I'll take off my shades when u take off your hat and show your hairline Method Man. hahaha
@Langston_Hers I have a black wife and many more black friends than white. Most white people are wack... but do u like any white person?
@bluntiful That's what I like best about u.
@Langston_Hers All U.S. music is influenced by black music period. I am the only white artist in history with a 90% black audience. smile
@bluntiful that's what I like best about u. Haha
@XangelP that's sacrilegious hahaha
@SokieSoak why do u wanna come!
@SokieSoak yes boo
