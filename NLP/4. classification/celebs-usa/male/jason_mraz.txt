Enjoy: https://t.co/qRpRNkzhYI  From @alanparsons' forthcoming album, The Secret: https://t.co/LmpsNqfy4G
A few months later Alan sent me a demo of “Miracle" and asked if I’d like to sing it. I’d be honored, I said. Today, “Miracle” is launched into space and I’m thrilled to be on board, hitchhiking thru the galaxy with the ever-trippy, sonically expansive @alanparsons.
Alan Parsons and I are both avocado growers, gentleman farmers, kind of neighbors in agriculture. We met at our mutual friends’ coffee farm and clicked almost immediately, retreating to Alan’s studio to talk music, magic, and cosmos.
...and ultimately become what my own career is about, trying to solve universal quandaries through song craft.
“Eye In The Sky” is a song I have a very early memory of, strapped in the backseat of my mom’s green Fiat, 1982. Alan Parsons Project is on the radio and I’m singing along, harmonizing. That sound of rich harmony over magical words would stick with me for my whole life...

...and it is absolutely free. And we can use Love in our daily lives to help overcome our sadnesses, injustices, inequalities, and suffering. And everyone suffers. So everyone can and will benefit from your Love. Thanks for sharing yours. https://t.co/0kujEfYCw0
One of my teachers, Terces Engelhart, says, “There is only love, everything else is our resistance to it.” Love is sharing. Love is service. Love is compassion. Love is acceptance. Love is listening. Love is empathy. Love is patience. Love is a healer. Love is all this &amp; more...
If this were an experiment, I’d say we all love and value the exact same things. Our precious planet and our even more precious time, smiling and laughing with our families and friends.
A couple of weeks ago, I asked listeners to point their camera in the direction of love. We received almost 1000 submissions from 51 countries, with cameras aimed at nature, art, and humanity. Watch now: https://t.co/0kujEfYCw0

When I heard @Bob_Schneider's version of "Making It Up" I immediately wanted to sing it, and he let me change a few things and make it mine. It's a great philosophy. You can hear his version of "Making It Up" on his 2018 release, Blood and Bones.
"Making It Up" from my new album Know., available now – https://t.co/jG0JedjvtT  This is a @Bob_Schneider song. He's my songwriting hero and kind of a mentor to me. He's inspired and encouraged my songwriting for more than 15 years. https://t.co/j7JatzaGFm

On tour &amp; live in stereo with Toca Rivera this fall… and you could win tickets! Enter here: https://t.co/NEzOAAVwQ3 https://t.co/CiHPNElJY6
Older live-versions were whoa - ahh - mumbles with something along the lines of, "once I dry these eyes I'll climb on to keep sleeping to dream about you." And I have no idea what that means. Thanks to Know., I now feel complete about the bridge. Toca's harmonies are great too.
"Sleeping To Dream" from my new album Know., available now – https://t.co/jG0JedjvtT  This 1999 fan-favorite has never appeared on a studio recording - until now. Once we made the decision to proceed with the song, I had to finally finish writing the bridge. https://t.co/ZviLdjuvYa
While mixing we decided to mute the drums and keep it primarily acoustic. I love that it sounds like a slow song, but remains a lively 6/8 with a constant driving beat. @RainingJane appears in the epic cascading vocals.  Listen now: https://t.co/jG0JedjvtT
"Let's See What The Night Can Do" from my new album Know., available now – https://t.co/jG0JedjvtT  Penned in February 2016 with the uber-talented Jon Green, this song instantly became my live-show opener. I knew since then it would kick start the album. https://t.co/fxczOciP7B

"We Can Take The Long Way" is an effort to tell a story about love and life with several songs from 'YES!' playing a supporting role.
Adding moving pictures can sometimes paint a mood/suggest an attitude that's different from how the listener hears a song in his/her heart.
Making a music video is challenging. To me a song is personal: its story, message, or melody resonating uniquely with each listener.
