@moonchick @JammieWF That's sadly true. But none of them so far have claimed to be "young Dads" when they're over a half-century or more old.
@glensharp33 And truth is an inattentive American public lets them get away with it if they like the pol anyway. There are no consequences for too many public wrongs. So as competitors they do what they can get away with.

@lilydaisyjoy Looks pretty nice
@lilydaisyjoy He held occasional fireside chats like that skillfully using the newer mass medium of radio but not for the SOTU
Meyers: According to new research, 60% of Americans say they plan to get in shape in 2019. And according to newer research, it's now just 10%.
And call it merely A Report to America so Pelosi/Schumer don't get equal TV time.
Or he could just mail the constitutionally-required report to Congress. That's how most presidents did until Wilson. https://t.co/jVQ6CrZ9nj
Maybe the president should give the SOTU at a packed diner in Ohio, take it to the real people for once instead of the DC elites
