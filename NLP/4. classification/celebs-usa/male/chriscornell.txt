@BryanWeber It’s for my wife, who I believe is a real person.
@garyjpearson I’ll usually play music and sing to get through those moments
@SubjectDownfall And I used producer Brendan O'Brien for a lot of reasons. I like the way his records sound.
@SubjectDownfall Recorded at Henson studios, which is on the old A &amp; M lot
@page_matthews Not really
@tessamorning - but I’ll change the order of verse last minute and stuff like that
@tessamorning Usually by the end of demoing it, I’ve done all I’m going to do to it -
@BronYrAur3 I used a martin parlor guitar and a gibson archtop while writing
@gearoidwalsh I wasn’t sure at first if I liked it, but I never really considered anything else after I figured it out.
@gearoidwalsh It was pretty much the first title I came up with.
@Emma_Maria11  The Beatles
@AngelaJMaher The song Higher Truth was. What’s on the record is the original version but I wrote about 5 different ones.
@lilyrayxoxo I've always liked The Monkees
@JanineLJC Songwriting experience I guess. There’s not much difference really.
@CrossleyNj Stretching
@Texas_Tina_ About 2 1/2 years with a lot of breaks for touring

@AmerSongwriter Thanks!
'@AmerSongwriter Been really happy working with Ben Kim & Matt again. Would have to be someone that at 1st thought makes no sense.
'@AmerSongwriter  I think movies can replace reality and in the case of my story I wouldn't trust many people with doing that.
'@AmerSongwriter No favorites. I think of them as children with strengths, weaknesses & secrets that reveal themselves over time.
'@AmerSongwriter Since I can remember, many of my songs were written on acoustic guitars so I am just peeling them back to original form.
'@AmerSongwriter ... to playing was to write songs.
'@AmerSongwriter I'm completely self-taught on guitar- limited me in some ways but very helpful in others. My only goal...
'@AmerSongwriter What I hear in my brain (brain radio) dictates the beginning of any attempt at a new Song.
'@AmerSongwriter Mostly trial and error, and a combination of songs  that make perfect sense and ones that require a complete reinvention.
'@AmerSongwriter ... Ron Anderson who's brilliant (if u listen)
'@AmerSongwriter Had some training early 90s for voice preservation but most comes from on the job training + lessons from ...
'@AmerSongwriter Always listening to new music but rare to hear new artists who make entire albums that draw me in I feel it's a dying art.
@AmerSongwriter The C where the high E wd be in Like Suicide was only way to get note to ring openly. I was thinking of "Born on the Bayou"
@AmerSongwriter TOTD was a capsule in time.I've written many songs since that could have been on that record,but not in a concentrated way.
@AmerSongwriter My relationship with my wife Vicky. We've lived & thrived through the darkest periods & came out stronger & closer.

once, while camping, I stole a bottle of wine from a Subaru at the trail head, broke off the top, and poored it through a T-shirt into a pot
@Di_McD Yes, that one!
@Drew_Live Yes, i will make it there. i stopped using that monitor after playing Jones Beach in 50 mph winds. freaked me out!
http://twitpic.com/3tbfn - did that tonight and got my hand in the way of a drum stick. I think it may be a bit broken. will see tomorrow.

@ChesterBe Do you get to Transform in the video?? is it green screen?
@vickycornell where is the beard trimmer??
@vickycornell voted no but maybe that is some kind of trick. some reverse psychology angle. I think she means yes!
The no's win. I may cut it myself though. butcher it. no mirror or light. like a blind man when the locks just feel too long in his hand.
@HateThisPlace Thats actually a great idea! some day I will do that!
So who thinks I should shave my head? @vickycornell says no. What does @ToniVasil say? What do YOU think. This is a real vote. I'm counting!

I am stuck in a cab. What is my dearest @Vickycornell twittering about?
Drove here from Seattle once with $50. Ate one mission Burrito a day for a week. Then I went home.
walked past a Woman who had sliced her wrist. 2 policemen were there. 1 was holding her arm above her heart. They were laughing at something
Other fun trips to  bay area, had a rifle aimed at me on the Presidio. Saw a punk get shot thru the hip by person shooting from a city bus.
Just landed In Oakland. I played "Day On The Green" here. Met Bill Graham weeks before he died. Same trip I saw Hells Angel chain whip a guy

I have downloaded a mac program where I can fly the plane from my seat. Let's see if it works!!!
Going to Salt Lake City where they have a different book. A guy named Joe Smith put it together. Is that his real name?
At the hotel I found a book In my room called "Bible". the front desk told me it was a users manual for Jesus. It was really long. Check it
I like Denver a lot. I will miss it. Zombies aside. Still grey. Still strange. Still.

@GraveYardDoug I couldnt watch watch that movie. it kills me that he died so young.
@KDUDE117 why not?
I aint doin shit!
That which doesn't kill us makes us sick for a while (sometime a long while) and leaves us, at least for a time, a little bit weaker.

@pinkkittygrl Im not talking about what he should do.
@meta9 That will be a great place to check for the Dali Lama after he dies!
If the Dali Lama know how to choose his parents he should teach me. I would choose a Forbes 100 family. 12 years of boarding school and $$$
@JTMcCracken So it was an experiment!
I saw John Denver once when I was visiting a radio station just before he crashed his "experimental" plane. He was very healthy looking.
On voice rest today. No speaking except on this thing. CAP LOCKS SHOUTING!!!! or tiny soft spoken nothings all ok. No wispering though.
Will the Second coming of Christ be born of Jewish Parents like the first time or Christian? (Virgin birth a givin)
Why can't the Dali Lama return as a woman? Or French?
Read an article on the guy who will replace Dali Lama while they look for his new incarnation. Why does he never return as a Swede or Britt?

the R&R commitee comes up with a list of Nominees then they send a ballot to an international voting body of 500 Rock experts! Who that?
@jokertt14 what about Audiosave and Temple of The Dog? I want 4!!
So I wanna help Rush get into R&R hall of fame. Who knows anything about getting someone nominated? I should know this stuff but I don't.
Doing vox warm up in bathroom of hotel. Some ugly ass tile in here
At Boston Logan international airport I saw 15 air marshal vehicles surrounding an Iran air commercial Jet. (3 days ago) tension anyone?
Early show in Ann Arbor. Haven't been here since early 90s. Great memories. A little hazey though. I always remember the hangovers.

I am stuck on tarmac waiting to take off to Detroit, once known as kill city which is a title now enjoyed by Baltimore.
Everybody grab your baby and squeeze em!!!!!
They don't have any motherfucking coffee in this terminal!!!!!
Cleveland airport has an impressive display of items confiscated by TSA that include a full metal jacket and dynamite
On my way to get some kick ass airport coffee! Fuck yeah!!!! This is me before coffee. I think it has a rittlin effect on me.
"Ever since I was an embryo! My mamma didn't want me, No!"
I wasn't hurt. They made me go to hospitol. In the room was a nurse who was rocking a 3 year old to keep her awake. She fell out of a tree
Once I was on a motor cycle trip  and a bee flew into my helmet and left stinger in my temple. My eye swelled shut. I looked like Tony Danza
When I was 12 I was hit by a car right in front of a fire station. There was an ambulance in the front. 25 min. Later an ambulance came.
Cleveland is rainy still. Drew carey is out getting us chicken wings. Mettalica is in the R&R hall of fame. The painted cow is asleep

There is no race or nationality that is incapable of the most inspiring acts of compassion and invention, or the most unthinkable atrocities
