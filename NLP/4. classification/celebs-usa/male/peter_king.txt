Getting whacked for a quarter of the season (the equivalent of 40 games in baseball, 20 in hockey/basketball) is significant, as is the scarlet letter of it.

Moral of the story for the 2019 Pro Football Hall of Fame class: We’re finally catching up to how the game of this new century is being played.   https://t.co/DRitfQgYWN
Good point. McVay is smart, a good motivator, has a good handle on his team. He’s 26-10 since taking over a flailing team. Much more likely than not that he’ll overcome this clunker and the Rams will be good going forward. https://t.co/AIqg5gfvxH
Robert Kraft, worn out post-SB, to me in FMIA and “The Peter King Podcast": “I honestly don't believe what our team and Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have done will ever be replicated in the age of the salary cap.” FMIA: https://t.co/SZMa2Jr5oJ - Pod: https://t.co/SfaxiCulRO
The football world has been taken with the genius of Sean McVay, who is 33 and half Belichick’s age, but he was just another speedbump to another Belichick #SuperBowl win.  https://t.co/SZMa2Jr5oJ
But the “coaching job of the season,” which it probably was, has no bearing on who wins coach of the year, voted on 5 weeks ago. The issue is whether awards should be done after the regular-season. If you vote Jan. 1, this was not Belichick’s year. https://t.co/m17KkpkBPm
Thing is, it’s a regular-season award. Pats had shaky (for them) 11-5 year. Bears finished 12-4 in Nagy’s first year after finishing last in division 4 straight years. This year, Belichick not winning is absolutely right. https://t.co/D8pa3FcOVm
I think the performance has to be a crushing one for Jared Goff and a humbling one for Sean McVay, but here's why I'm not too worried about either man:   https://t.co/k0iCvRwYUv
Nice job today, and all season, @AlbertBreer. Learned a lot here. https://t.co/68E4fDzYOK

Tired of hearing this justification. A league that talks about loving its its fans just gave the back of its hand to one of the great and most fervent markets in the league. Goodell should have done the right thing and felt NO’s pain. Had plenty of time to do it. He didn’t. https://t.co/Smlh1rBisg

Right. Gammons was incredible and indefatigable. I just loved him. https://t.co/jvrgKjIfEE
I need to listen to him on NFL Gamepass this week. Everyone says he was prescient and great. In the press box I don’t listen to the game I am watching. https://t.co/qRqmSdsB3O
Thanks. I know it’s popular to bash McDaniels after the Indy thing. But he's a terrific coach. His gameplans are varied and smart. Think of his call to Gronkowski on the OT drive—that play was not in the gameplan. Thought of it on the fly, as the 40-second clock wound down. https://t.co/uDj6PDWXPQ
Consider this about New Orleans:   Over their last seven games—five regular season, two postseason—the Saints, with a supposedly great offense, averaged a measly 19.7 points per game.   https://t.co/0ajAWzwcx9
I am an old man, that’s why. https://t.co/lOzWNgw00D
As a kid in Enfield, Conn., I wanted to be Peter Gammons when I grew up. He inspired me. https://t.co/rI31KBP0Jc
I am lucky to have friends like @JeffDarlington and @JennyVrentas, both of whom took photos of me and Brady yesterday and sent to me. I am thankful to know them. https://t.co/YremDn0M1u
I don’t know. The Combine has to happen. The six or so team in the top 15 of the draft needing a QB will have to determine how much value he has, and how high they’d be willing to move up for him. https://t.co/FrAf8tklw7
I have not been in a Costco in four or five years, and I forget it, quite honestly. That’s quite a question. https://t.co/NwyzItcY0R
I don’t see it, but it’s hard to predict the future. They certainly aren’t setting LA on fire, but Dean Spanos tells me they’re playing the long game. We’ll see. https://t.co/WvP6wMK0A9
Good question. I hear he could bring Jim Caldwell, but I don’t know about the rest of the staff. https://t.co/39FhJ5F0xt
Every one of them means so much to Brady. He loves playing, loves practicing, loves studying. Was thrilled to see McDaniels installing 8 new plays 7 hours before the game. He loves every aspect of the job. https://t.co/hw7bjZ4ZqY
No. Loves the game too much. https://t.co/UyHl7uEobP

To see Alshon Jeffery after the toughest moment of his career stand and be accountable says a lot about Jeffery and the team Doug Pederson and Howie Roseman have assembled. Kudos to the Eagles.
A couple of notes about the Eagles. I’ve got tremendous respect for their franchise and what they did in the last 13 months … 5-1 and a title last year post-Wentz injury, 4-1 and a playoff win at Chi this year post-Wentz injury. As I wrote today, they won and lost with class…
Very tough omission. Likely would have had him aside Donald if I did not move Watt inside. https://t.co/VtcjAKAzg7

Kenny Moore (5-9, 190) told me for What I Learned: "The biggest lesson I’ve learned is pretty easy. Work. Just work. It’s not over till it’s over. You can have the worst childhood, and you can have other disadvantages in your life, and you just work. Can’t stress that enough.”
This Kenny Moore is a revelation. Second week in a row he’s been a dominant figure in a playoff game for Indy.
If you want to watch the extended Mahomes interview, you can find it here: https://t.co/RMHCWZ5RQX
Today just after 4 pm ET on @SNFonNBC, @PatrickMahomes5 tells me how he makes those crazy throws. Kansas City tells us why it’s smitten. https://t.co/gbH1GdQOY4
New Arizona coach Kliff Kingsbury told me today that Josh Rosen is definitely his quarterback of the future.
.@PatrickMahomes5 made one throw, only one, in our @NBCSports shoot with him. My response: You’re kind of accurate. https://t.co/lwxiGVUpqM
In first Eagles-Saints game, New Orleans targeted two players and won by 41. Both likely to miss Sunday’s rematch. Plus some color from me embed with the Saints 7 weeks ago. https://t.co/pzbxfY96YP
Great story, @donbanks. Made this historic game come to life. https://t.co/akojWigLl3
This is great. Congrats on telling the story so well, @TheWilderThings. https://t.co/NSPEmmtysW
How big a part was Pederson? Nagy? https://t.co/Xpa8mpnzYO
Man, @alexmarvez is one heck of a worker bee. Kudos to you, Alex. https://t.co/1fHp2zzsfe
Love when people like @AKinkhabwala and @danorlovsky7 make me significantly smarter about football. They’re great on this week’s podcast … and a bonus guest! @DerwinJames ! https://t.co/ARs5FaNZ4p
This is the kind of story only a smart and plugged-in beat person can write. @josephperson, this is terrific. Congrats. https://t.co/sD9Q74BxSh
This is my unfiltered 13-minute chat with @PatrickMahomes5. The story on Mahomes for @SNFonNBC by me and @MarissaAni will air in NBC pregame show Saturday. (There will be tattoos.) https://t.co/RMHCWZ5RQX
Eight openings that year. Arians was 8th coach hired. Got a perfectly good coaching staff. That’s my point. This rush to get “a great coaching staff” is a pile of crap." https://t.co/uR2oGTqa0i
I feel for Eric Bienemy, Zac Taylor, Kris Richard, Dan Campbell, Dave Toub. Do you know how good these coaches are? I mean, this rush to hire coaches is really, really problematic to me.
If I was my aunt, I would have breasts. https://t.co/aGWY48pRzC
They were 3 coaches of 16 on the staff.  Three. How about Arians? The most overrated point about hiring a coach late is that he won’t be able to build a good staff. History has proven it’s bunk. https://t.co/hDPbz1iYqP
That really hurt Reich last year, and Bruce Arians 6 years ago in Arizona. https://t.co/zDkny3KQr2
Eight playoff teams remaining. Obviously none would have a soul worthy of being a head coach over the 7 hired hired in the last 50 hours.
How’d it turn out for them? https://t.co/kfwt5sxHjx
I do not understand the sprint to hire coaches. Seven coaches hired in 50 hours. One name to remember: Frank Reich. Hired 42 days after the end of the 2017 regular season.
You are doing a good job, @RapSheet. https://t.co/aKEIaaPYCs
Kitchens4 That’s the kind of stuff a football man like Dorsey likes to hear.
Kitchens3 Kitchens said: “Carson Palmer had four of the best years of his life with me, and the single best year of his life with me. But I don’t clamor for attention. I never advertised for a job, never sent out propaganda for a job. I never will.”
Kitchens2 When I asked Kitchens a month ago about long-term coaching aspirations, he said: “I don’t think about it. I truly don’t. I am here to do a job at this present time. It is no different than any other job I have had …
Kitchens1 One thing I think about the Freddie Kitchens hire in Cleveland: I think his ignore-the-early-season-Hue-dysfunction, all-business, no-politicking-for-the-job-late-in-the-season approach is something GM John Dorsey loved. (more)
Info-packed “The Peter King Podcast” this week: -@AKinkhabwala on the dysfunctional Steelers. Really smart stuff. -@danorlovsky7 on what is making Nick Foles go, and (as a former McVay QB) how he’s trying to right the Ram ship. @DerwinJames on Chargerdom. https://t.co/ARs5FaNZ4p
Meow. https://t.co/LoIhWibOPL
Had a good and productive chat with @DeionSanders for his 21st &amp; Prime show on @nflnetwork, airing tonight at 6:30 pm. We talked Antonio Brown. Gotta hand it to Deion. We have different opinions on the missed week 17 game. He was strident and respectful. Kudos to him.
That is not old school. It is being an honorable person. Kingsbury should have never taken one job if he was going to look for another job 3 weeks later. https://t.co/d6y8nLjWnh
Ezekiel Elliott is the kind of smart, physical back Vince Lombardi and Paul Brown would have loved.    Why he's one of my Offensive Players of the Week:  https://t.co/gxbj8a2OGK

It’s been a fun weekend. Column in the hands of ace ed @dombonvissuto. Should be up by 10:30 pm in Oahu. 3:30 am ET 2:30 am CT 1:30 am MT 12:30 am PT And 10:30 am in Helsinki.

Taking your questions/comments/brickbats for the Monday column. Send to: peterkingfmia@gmail.com — Quite a weekend.
Two others details: 1 @PatrickMahomes5 threw this football 27 yards away from the target. We measured. 2 This was no rehearsed thing. He made one throw, only one. And you see what happened. https://t.co/QgDzYCg0nY
Remember @PatrickMahomes5’ incredible no-look pass to @honeythunder11? He recreates it perfectly. I’ll have more in tomorrow’s Football Morning in America: https://t.co/b3YL8CneQe https://t.co/lwxiGVUpqM
BALTIMORE-Fifty minutes into a playoff game, Baltimore has 3 first downs and minus-2 net passing yards.
Have a good night, everyone. Thanks for the interactions.
I think so too. But I also think this situation needs to settle down and then each side should consider what’s best. No need to make a decision till early March. https://t.co/3IY3tSjlrB
That’s easy. Funkhouser introduces nephew to Larry, who sets into motion kid going to Spain and getting trampled to death by bulls. Prit-TAY good. https://t.co/79bnDDTd5q
Well, you have your story wrong. I am in favor of Sharper’s right to be considered for the Hall, not for his enshrinement. Re Brown, I would not vote for a guy who went AWOL on his team before the biggest game of the year for anything. That is true. https://t.co/kAUxysrG5X

1 Payton/Brees, night before Phil-Saints game in Nov, after watching them go through gameplan, play by play. Fascinating. Respect each has for the other sticks with me. 2 Nate Burleson. Podcast. Fantastic. Much respect for a smart future power player on the media horizon. https://t.co/DTOU6EA2lY
Hmmmm. Not really. He’s confident yet humble. What I would be encouraged about if I were a Chiefs fan is how Mahomes has taken a leadership role seamlessly at a young age, particularly post-Kareem Hunt, that every player and coach respects. https://t.co/StpDRd1Vsn
Three times. Love it. https://t.co/GjVOlzSpJE
Great question. Brown and Steelers need to take a break. Let this simmer down. Start of league year is 9.5 weeks away, so no decision on his future needs to be made for a while. https://t.co/ALiwnJ8IwV

I don’t have one. Sorry. I’d be inventing one. I do think Mike McCarthy, in this place and time, would be smart. But there might be someone better. They need to go through the process with an open mind. https://t.co/ukf4Pjb4vE
A lot better than that. They’re one win (in a game they’ll be favored to win) away from another title game. https://t.co/gD8R12QTZv
I spent some time with @PatrickMahomes5 today. https://t.co/GJyspNOGzT
I don’t know. Go through the process. Have an open mind. Take Eric Bienemy very seriously. Have a chunk on him in my column Monday. He’s good. https://t.co/bHAHXfTy8f
I understand Vance Joseph, Hue, Marvin Lewis, Bowles. I do not understand Steve Wilks. I do not like that firing at all. Highly respected guy in a rebuilding situation. Should have had another year. https://t.co/iusn4kRIbX
Fantastic question. I don’t know. Will look into it next week if they win in Chicago. https://t.co/2evn08ATrk
Very interesting. Nick’s a unique guy, a smart guy. He’s not going to chase the last dollar. I really wonder if he might—MIGHT—agree to be the Eagles’ ace relief pitcher for the next couple of years. Don’t know if he will. Maybe a smart franchise (Giants?) will offer him more. https://t.co/Jt0ESSB4fR
Flying home from an NBC assignment in Kansas City. Have a few minutes to answer questions on the playoffs or anything of your choosing. Fire away.
I’ll be writing on the Brown issue Monday. Thanks for the feedback, I think.
I never voted for Sharper to be in the Hall of Fame, but after being away from Twitter for much of the day, I see that is the perception. Unfortunate. No idea how these disparate events four years apart got conjoined, but that is social media life. https://t.co/kAUxysrG5X

Good luck to @MikeMayock in his job with the Raiders. Every time I called, he answered. Every time I asked for help on college players, he answered. Every time I wanted him for a podcast or column, he said yes. He's been a fountain of vital information. Thanks, Mike. Best to you.
Excellent point, @SolomonsWisdom. Marvin Lewis deserves credit for bringing respect to a team that had been so adrift. https://t.co/VO1s5suW3r

Mahomes the shortstop, running across the bag, making the three-quarters flip to first to complete the double play. That really used to happen. Great training for what he just did.

I really love writing the Monday column. I appreciate you reading it.
Always thought the “Mayfield is a punk” line of thinking before the draft was too easy--and dumb. Using the winning TD Sat in Denver, read how he’s become next-level at the line of scrimmage, and how Freddie Kitchens has helped him get there. https://t.co/NUSPCw7wKE

Vehemently agree to disagree. It’s a football game. You can’t affect games like that with the kind of tacky-tack flags that are thrown far, far too often in these games. https://t.co/PzwRTU0Bz1
Wish you’d watch the play again. And tell me if you watch it and no flag was thrown, would you have thought, “Man, that’s taunting! Where’s the flag?" https://t.co/OlCwq4iQZc
You’ve got to be kidding, Tom. OBJ and Norman were at war. These two guys weren’t even pissy. A ridiculous call. https://t.co/8lWUnI96Zk

Stay in bounds, Ekeler
Fantastic game. Exactly the duel anyone would have hoped for. Chargers now need one first down to bleed the clock all the way down and try a field goal to win.

A very good look at one of the most compelling and mysterious stories in the league by @kalynkahler. Attaway, Kalyn. https://t.co/62U39qkvGG
One of the takeaways from tonight is the story of Dallas LB Jaylon Smith, whose draft stock plummeted after the major knee injury in the 2015 ND bowl game. Remember when the Cowboys got ripped for picking him 34th overall with so many needs? He was great tonight.
I hope the attorneys for these players keep these video clips on the uncalled flagrant hits to the helmet for future reference.
The NFL has to answer about these lowering the helmet calls. The league is toothless. Where is the accountability for the officials on those calls? League says they’re all-in on enforcing helmet hits, and they let those like ones on Jordan Reed (Sunday) and Kamara now go.
Why, hello Amy. https://t.co/Hz1z5TiczT
Problem w/MMQBing on calls like Payton going on 4th+goal from the 1 when he’s 11-of-12 on 4th+1 this year:  You can’t call the guy dumb for a call after it fails. Of course it looks bad then. But why would the best offense by far in football NOT go for it on 4th+1 w/those odds?
Why? https://t.co/WzsMlfSXv3
11 for 12 on fourth downs this year. Have stones. Go for it. https://t.co/l0tfDJ7iNW
For some reason, the NFL won’t call the vast majority of the helmet hits anymore. That was a clear one.
Well, that is good of you to say. I have not met Phillip Lindsay. Before Tuesday I had never talked to him. But as you’ll hear in this podcast, it is very hard to not like the NFL’s 7th-leading rusher, who came out of nowhere. https://t.co/FzDSeqbMaz

Green Bay under .500 on Thanksgiving. Rodgers has started all 10 games. — Regardless how the Packers got there, that portends bad things for Mike McCarthy. Very bad.
Amazing Green Bay is ahead by only 4. Feels like it could be a 14-points game, easy.
Rodgers threw that ball 62 yards in the air: -While being mugged and nearly sacked. -While his receiver was being interfered with (and not called) -And it was a perfect throw.
This @MIkeTrout is a good dude. https://t.co/cNwXfUfRXB

Monday in my Football Morning in America column: “What I Learned” from Linda Zimmerman, about her late husband Dr. Z. - A bit from Linda: "Paul was like 10 cats in a pillowcase. They’re all in there, fighting it out."
The @nytimes obit on Paul Zimmerman: https://t.co/0gCA3w7ao2 — Thanks, @RichSandomir.
Spoke with Linda Zimmerman, widow of Paul. She wants all of you—hundreds of you—to know how deeply she appreciates your kind words, tributes and warmth in the last 24 hours. Linda is in a good place. She was with Paul at the end, and it was peaceful, and she is thankful for that.
We all should have a partner in life like Paul had in Linda, his wife of 19 years. She was so wonderful to him through the fun of their early years and through the pain of their final years. Never wavered. Linda was the definition of a loving, devoted spouse.
So many people in our business were inspired to dream to do this work by Paul Zimmerman. Neil Hornsby, the founder of @PFF. KC Joyner, Doug Farrar … and so many more. He had more influence on the business than anyone I know.
I will never forget the generosity of the NFL community when there was a fundraiser for Dr. Z after his strokes … $235,000 was raised for his long-term care through the help of Tom Coughlin, Rex Ryan, Yogi Berra and so many others. - You all came through for him.
In November 2006, Paul suffered a series of 3 strokes that left him unable to speak and write. - In October, Paul and wife Linda moved to Indiana, so he could be in an assisted living facility there and they could be close to her family. He died today in Noblesville, Ind.
We have lost a legend. Football writer/raconteur Paul Zimmerman, 86, died this afternoon. There’s only one Dr. Z. He’ll be missed.

Jameis Winston's tendency to make high-risk, low-percentage throws has, if anything, gotten worse and that could mean the end for him in Tampa Bay.  https://t.co/Ib5Ou4Vz4j https://t.co/suHnvsP71s
Asked @AdrianPeterson if he thought it “ludicrous” that he could challenge @EmmittSmith22's record.   His response: "I believe in myself."  https://t.co/CRib9hLm6Q https://t.co/4Zjg5z4Xv2
Ty Montgomery just needed to take a knee after receiving a Ram kickoff in the end zone, but the Packers kick returner ran it out.  And for that, he's the GOAT of the Week https://t.co/VBe5Vh5JBk
Interceptions, game by game, by NFC South QBs in their last 5 games:   Brees: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.   Ryan: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.   Newton: 0, 2, 1, 0, 0.   Winston: 3, 2, 2, 2, 4. —   Sort of says it all. — More in my Monday column. Have a good day, everyone. https://t.co/SrMzMrttDY

LOS ANGELES-We’ll be early with Football Morning in America. Ace ed @dombonvissuto should have it up by 3 a.m. ET. I’m red-eying home. Have a good night. Or morning, for those in Lisbon. Or the Faroe Islands.
Wow, Ephraim. Thanks for the note. That is incredible. https://t.co/bRBoqwGXm0
LOS ANGELES-Not to be sappy as I wrap up my column, but my father died in Feb 1986. Huge Red Sox fan. Never saw them win a World Series. My first thought tonight as, out of corner of my eye in Coliseum press box as Sox won Series: Dad would have loved 1 of these. Now there are 4.
Answering your questions in my Monday column. Have any? Comments? Rants? Send tonight: peterkingfmia@gmail.com
LOS ANGELES-Not positive, but I believe the roar for the Packers when they ran out of the tunnel was as loud a cheer as I’ve ever heard for a road team in an NFL stadium.
LOS ANGELES-It’s the first game as a pro at the Coliseum for @AaronRodgers12. He’s ready. https://t.co/VQihQmb9es
Love you, @danpompei. Best to you, and best to your family.

A question worth asking:   What would the Jags have to throw at the Giants to get them to consider trading Eli Manning?  https://t.co/FOLBdHa09e
No. https://t.co/3ePattIVqm
If I were Indianapolis GM Chris Ballard, I’d be tempted to go hard after Le’Veon Bell, but making a trade happen is going to be next to impossible. Here's why:  https://t.co/vKsAYxSBF1 https://t.co/F5DHDaILcK
If there was ever any doubt about the size of @AaronDonald97's contract, doubt it no more.  The @RamsNFL tackle is one of my Defensive Players of the Week: https://t.co/x3CvHluv5T https://t.co/mrPkbIQqFR
By my very rough estimate, he’d snapped about 500 straight balls without getting flagged. So why now? Should have been encroachment. Watch centers on shotgun and kicking-game snaps. They move the ball often before the snap. The call was stupid. https://t.co/OYkCMPljnT
If the Bengals are not going to discipline linebacker Vontaze Burfict seriously, the NFL should. More in #FMIA: https://t.co/FCqWslihRA

Good evening/morning. FMIA filed to ace ed @dombonvissuto. It’s a long one. Things happened. Should be live by 4:10 am ET. Thanks for reading. You can find it here in a few minutes: https://t.co/hriGMcRhmB — Have a good night, all.
Maybe, but 3 RBs have won in the last 13 years. https://t.co/mvUYQNAziV
That he is. You guys convinced me. Well, that plus the 14 touchdowns, double more than anyone else in the league. https://t.co/x7Ie41iUna
This question has been asked annually since 2008. Answer is yes, I do see him making it past this year, unless he wants to leave. https://t.co/5YMYqkP0CR
Good call, @NFL_DougFarrar. Had the key block on Kiko Alonso (on a perfect pulling play) to help spring Kerryon Johnson for the 71-yard run earlier. https://t.co/4GSMUqdftG
Patterson’s even now.
Kudos, @Andy_Benoit, for telling one of the great comeback stories I’ve seen in this league—the Joe Cullen story. https://t.co/ZBClZ3XxQ6 — You can fix your life. Joe Cullen did.
Important work being done for Hurricane Michael relief. Help if you can. Thanks. https://t.co/0qjtiWP8KT
Tremendous work, @KelvinBeachumJr. There’s such a need, and you acted. https://t.co/z76oCihoLQ
Unlike Peyton Manning and Brett Favre, Drew Brees is playing like he's still in his prime at 39. @NFL Game Pass shows some of the tricks up the quarterback's sleeve.  https://t.co/fXilIynwSW https://t.co/C0bTfQIWD5
Tweet of the Night, @jasongay https://t.co/iwCxtQzp8C
MVP throw right there.
True that, @BNightengale. Question for you and @PeteAbe and @alexspeier and @Joelsherman1: If West ruled fan interference on the field, does there have to be incontrovertible evidence otherwise to overturn it? https://t.co/Wic8eislqP
My ed, @dombonvissuto, and son Jude. Big Muncy guys. Saw a great game. Conflicting reports on Machado effort. https://t.co/LXtsrif5Zy
Philadelphia's offense was in trouble heading into Week 6. @NFL GamePass shows how the chemistry between Carson Wentz and Alshon Jeffrey bolstered the Eagles. https://t.co/fXilIynwSW https://t.co/i3wYgLvhi5

Last sales pitch on today’s FMIA: the @SeanPayton story from the Saints’ 2006 bye Sunday on @DrewBrees is something of value to every coach and every player in every sport. And not only sports—in whatever walk of life you’re in. Thanks to Payton  for sharing it. https://t.co/KHjJF6DBMU
That was a great game too; you’re right. This had the added value of being the best team of the last 20 years, defending its throne against the new 5-0 contenders with big star 23-year-old QB. Context matters. https://t.co/yp6OHdJHpb
Lots of admiration for such a great team @theMMQB. Great work, all. https://t.co/tsLMF9iknM
Doubt that. Watch the throws Goff made against Minnesota. “Plenty of” QBs can’t make those throws. https://t.co/RlpaIGb6gM
One of the things I liked about last night’s postgame: the respect that flowed for the opposition out of each locker room. Pats effusively praised Mahomes, Hill, Reid, Hunt. KC: same re Brady, Hightower, Gronk, Belichick, McD. Sportsmanlike game, w/a post-game exclamation point.
You’re right. Reprehensible by Burfict, whose history is littered with junk like this. I should have caught that. https://t.co/hYDpIGvM3t
He was on it early. I think over 6 weeks Goff has been more valuable overall. And it’s tough to put 2 guys from one football team on the list. But the season is young. We’ll see. https://t.co/uj8DNYFR2X
On NE 43, KC 40: 1 Best game I’ve seen since 25-point comeback in SB 51. 2 If Mahomes was sharp early, it could have been a 100-point game. 3 For KC to win SB, wispy Tyreek Hill must, must stay healthy. 4 Never saw 3 guys doubled on 1 play till last night. https://t.co/H51mZByIeZ
FOXBORO, Mass.-Well, I’ve seen a few games in 35 seasons covering the NFL. I saw something in the Sunday night game I’ve never seen before. Doubt Tom Brady has either. Amazing sight in an amazing football game. (Good try, Bob Sutton. I mean that.) https://t.co/H51mZByIeZ https://t.co/KHjJF6m0Vm

Once, @MercPurdy gave Dave Anderson the highest compliment. I asked his opinion of Dave, and Mark said, “He always writes the right thing.” - From one great columnist to another.
RIP, Dave Anderson. The longtime sports columnist of the @NYTimes was a mentor to many (including me) and shining example of how smart, concise, pointed prose could tell the best story. Just a great and generous man too.
3-time ACLer @JakeButtTE, has a pretty good attitude. The Denver tight end on my podcast this week: “Life goes on. I’m gonna be fine. I’m gonna be out there next fall. I’m freakin’ blessed.” — https://t.co/WQFRkITOCF — What a week: Jared Goff and @ESPNBooger too.
How’d Jared Goff get so good so fast? A lot has to do with Sean McVay. Let’s roll the tape with @NFL GamePass. https://t.co/fXilIynwSW https://t.co/PV1QdJl0ad
Get well, Matt. https://t.co/nT7mvbbkra
My fault. Yes, @ESPNBooger . https://t.co/BSbcj9Ddez
You mean @BoogerESPN? He has a job in broadcasting because he imparts knowledge in an easy, fairly concise way. I think early on in his MNF role he’s been very good. https://t.co/vbTb7bAdyK

One of my coolest podcasts: Jared Goff on his rise, Jake Butt’s third ACL at 23, @ESPNBooger on his stunning rise at MNF. https://t.co/ARs5FaNZ4p - Butt’s reaction to this one: “Punched a couple walls.” - Please: Listen to his attitude. “There’s no one here who can stop me."
Really fun “Peter King Podcast” drops in the morning: -Rams QB Jared Goff. How’d he get so good so fast? -Denver TE Jake Butt. So sad. So inspiring. -ESPN MNF analyst @ESPNBooger. What’s the story with that wacky perch? Will send link in the morning.

BuckyBleepingDent 4 -- More shots. Yanks 5, Sox 4. Depression sets in. Not for long. We both have an Athens City Council meeting to cover for a class that night. We get there. Room spinning. Took a zero on the paper. We couldn’t write. Not such a great day. Memorable, though.
BuckyBleepingDent 3 -- Boston scores one in the second. Shot for me. Boston scores one in the sixth. Shot for me. Yanks put two on in the seventh. Then Dent hits a fly ball over the Monster. Three shots for Grossi. I am so depressed that I, too, take three.
BuckyBleepingDent 2 We make a deal. For every Red Sox run, he buys me a shot of Black Velvet. Every Yankee run, I buy @TonyGrossi one.
BuckyBleepingDent I — Oct. 2, 1978. Forty years ago today. The Bucky Dent game. I’m a senior at Ohio U. @TonyGrossi (Yanks fan) and I (Sox fan) decide to watch the 1-game AL pennant playoff, Yanks at Sox, at 2 pm, at The Union, a bar in Athens.

We flushed it like a loss" -Belichick opens up (Lied about that last one.) https://t.co/eq2Se6oKDp
In today's FMIA column at @NBCSports, you'll find: • Odd Sunday? Nope. "This is the normal," one vet says. • Bills win; no fluke • Brees is a metronome • Roughing the passer, 🤷‍♂️ • Urinal Guy has Eli questions • Ed Hochuli. RV road dog. More: https://t.co/TmgBCuUVLq https://t.co/DPOzCiXraz
My Week 3 Football Morning in America column is up: https://t.co/w4eICQALX6 https://t.co/MfyneklZgx
Long day’s journey into night. Column filed to ace ed @dombonvissuto. Interesting Ed Hochuli “What I Learned” section. Man, this was a fire drill this week.
This is good, @BenVolin. https://t.co/dtCq94EXZ9
Will answer a few questions in my Monday column, as usual. Send questions, comments, brickbats to peterkingfmia@gmail.com
That play by Mahomes.
Good luck to @juliuspeppers_ and all those helping out the needy in Florence-ravaged areas. https://t.co/uh7vak3NQD
The @NFL GamePass end zone view shows why Patrick Mahomes has been on fire this season. https://t.co/fXilIyF7Ku https://t.co/DZoKKhL9s0
Frank Reich's offensive brilliance has defenses scrambling against the Indianapolis Colts. Presented by @NFL GamePass, take a look at how one Reich play offers multiple options for success. https://t.co/fXilIynwSW https://t.co/sQpxgG06Ji
Terry McAulay: “There are two fundamental principles of rules-making. Number one is player safety. Number two is maintaining a balance between offense and defense. I think college football has lost that number two. And if the NFL’s not careful, they’re going to lose it.” New pod. https://t.co/VunVG1pdnL
New podcast: Vet NFL official Terry McAulay, now NBC NFL rules analyst, and @JeffPearlman on the life and death of the USFL. https://t.co/WQFRkITOCF - McAulay shares my belief that the league is totally out of control on roughing-the-passer. He’s got good reasoning.
Congrats, @SI_LeeJenkins on the new gig with the Clippers. You’re one of the all greats for @SINow, and I have no doubt you’ll be an NBA great too. Good luck!

Tweet of the Night (for those of a certain age) https://t.co/3iw1ljQuFP
If that’s a real penalty, the NFL has crossed the rubicon. https://t.co/cD1YjcxaXh
If the reports are true, of course.
The Patriots don’t often do dumb things. They are 68 million times smarter than me at football. But I think casting your lot with a person with Gordon’s history is asinine. Look at his resume in my column this morning.
Come for Mahomes stuff. Stay for Alex Smith and Jack Morris and A-Rod, and Marshal Yanda on kale and yoga. Yes, Yanda on kale. It’s a keeper. https://t.co/q2D2qfxqXX
Good dog. https://t.co/65gOzF7KrW
Also in FMIA: -One word to describe pursuit of Josh Gordon: lunacy -MVP after 2 wks: 1 Mahomes, 2 Fitzmagic -Mack v Ifedi: Uh oh, Seattle -I play Connect Four w/@saquon. It’s not pretty -Scoring up 8 ppg -Read “Big Game” -Cousins on Clay: “probably a generous call" https://t.co/Hg9spppNNv

Good night all. Appreciate you.
Thanks, @leepers500. @dombonvissuto is invaluable. I could not do this without him. He keeps me honest and sane. He is a great conscience. https://t.co/GpOijv41Xy

Hello! Greetings from the Upper West Side. I will be asleep in 10 minutes. Hope you will be too. https://t.co/WQ0vxtuzNw
And let’s hear it for @dombonvissuto. He’s been the editor of this monstrosity for quite a while. It’s aging him. But he can’t quit it. And he’s great at it. Tell Dom how much you appreciate him, if you’re of a mind.

Getting in a good groove with FMIA. Final bit filed at 3:08 am ET. Now in hands of ace ed @dombonvissuto, who reports the column should be up by 3:55 am ET. Hey, Pacific Timers! Stay awake! You can read it first!
I don’t know, @kurt13warner. I do know this was a pretty normal tackle of a quarterback, with the head taken out of the play, in the correct strike zone, a split-second after the QB releases the ball. Should not have been penalized. https://t.co/4jDtk0iLhA
How about A-Reid? He’s glam. https://t.co/VuxzWibTkb
This is the kind of day, and night, when it’s so fun to write this column. Had no idea at the start of the day I’d be hearing tales of a 6-year-old Patrick Mahomes getting batting lessons from A-Rod by the end of the day.
Great story about Jack Morris. - Thanks much to @peteabe, @PatrickReusse and @LaTroyHawkins32 for their help in finding Pat Mahomes the dad. - Worth the effort.
Talked to NFL QB Patrick Mahomes and ex-MLB pitcher Pat Mahomes for top of FMIA. - Perhaps the only time A-Rod, A-Reid, Jack Morris and Tyreek Hill will share the top of my column.
Tony Corrente is a good referee, but this is really an awful call. https://t.co/vfgdtwRkP7
My @saquon story for @SNFonNBC coming up in this hour. You’ll like what’s got his dad most excited about the kid’s NFL life.

You are a smart man! Read “What I Learned” in Monday’s FMIA to see why Yanda says, “Sleep is my performance-enhancing drug." https://t.co/nZwPp1eW3P
Fun FMIA Monday … including a cool What I Learned section with one of the players I’ve grown to admire over the years, telling me about how vital sleep is: “Sleep is my performance-enhancing drug.” - Guess who said it?
Comments/questions for my Monday FMIA column … send to peterkingfmia@gmail.com today.
Genius Tweet, @WillBrinson. https://t.co/Hc6hB8OxQZ
1 Give back judges ability to call “flagrant DPI” on such a play. That would be a spot foul. 2 College doesn’t have the DPI spot-foul rule. Last year, Stanford coach David Shaw told me it’s not abused in college football. - People assume it’d be abused in NFL. I doubt it. https://t.co/62LLDkdkBZ
Here’s a better idea. Don’t have 31-yard flags for totally marginal penalties. https://t.co/6gJFMEixM2
DPI being a spot foul continues to be the dumbest penalty in the NFL rule book, and nothing is close for second place. - Latest example: 31-yard flag on Kirkpatrick for the ticky-tackiest of jersey grabs to set up the Balt TD at end of half.
Hey @Claydalrymple: I thought you’d be patrolling CF in Fenway one day. Glad to see you finally made it there. Congrats on the wedding. https://t.co/11XhRRQoM3

Congratulations to @albertbreer on the big promotion @themmqb and @sinow. Good luck! So pleased to see this, Albert.
Bold prediction of the week: I predict those are the end of the competent predictions I will make this year. https://t.co/qc6IF16HuC
Aaron Rodgers may have led the Packers' comeback, but the different angles from @NFL GamePass show this was a full team effort. https://t.co/t0FutPd3ru https://t.co/fXilIynwSW
“You don’t make a living in this league trading Hall of Fame players.” — @ESPNBooger, on the Raiders trading Khalil Mack.                      — The truth. Glad he said it.
Excellent point by @ESPNBooger about Goff’s poor pocket awareness on the Irvin strip-sack. Timed it. Goff held it for 4.26 seconds. I mean, a QB’s got to have a sense, particularly in that sound machine, of how much time is too much to hold it.
Lions’ performance is worst of week 1, worse than Buffalo’s. Detroit’s home, Detroit’s got a QB, Detroit should be getting a boost from a new coach. Patricia’s mentor would fire a couple of players in the wake of a game like this. Will he? -- Next 2 Det home games: NE, GB.
90-10 is not the rule. Common sense is not the rule. Absolute certainty that the call on the field was wrong is the rule. https://t.co/eRQqCWI58B
The idea to ONLY overturn calls that were shown to be irrefutably incorrect. https://t.co/uCNzwta267
I’d rather have this replay interpretation system, with a very high standard for an overturn, than last year’s system, with a 60-40 standard for an overturn. (And sometimes it was less than 60 percent.)
One of the leftovers that didn’t fit in FMIA today: I hear DeShone Kizer went up to @AaronRodgers12 after GB’s win over Chi and thanked him for his first win as an NFL player. — FMIA: https://t.co/d8hvsHpG3m
Instant replay, 2018 version. https://t.co/zV7O7F0NOw

Good morning. I hope you read everything in FMIA today. But it you’ve got time for one thing, please read about my visit to see Bart Starr in Birmingham, and his class, and his gallantry. https://t.co/shpF9LXT8c
In today's FMIA column at @NBCSports, you'll find: • The greatest game @AaronRodgers12 ever played • The smartest fantasy player you don't know • The best hotel in an NFL city • Other items without superlatives • Week 1! Weather Delays! Ties! https://t.co/d8hvsH84EM https://t.co/zG6DKQoCBH
My Week 1 Football Morning in America column is up: https://t.co/d8hvsH84EM https://t.co/4mYB9qR5Ok
That was an eventful evening. FMIA up around 4:10 am ET. Thanks to @dombonvissuto for the toiling. - Please read Randall Cobb on the game of the day … and read about the backstory to my @AaronRodgers12/Bart Starr Sunday night @SNFonNBC piece.
Kind of reminded me of the Favre against-the-odds performance on MNF in Oakland the day after his dad died. But @AaronRodgers12 was injured, and had to come back from 20 down against a good defense. I think this was the best game of Rodgers’ pro career. https://t.co/4k2xs5fxzm
Packers-heavy FMIA hitting the home stretch. 90% in hands of ace ed @dombonvissuto. Whew. Heck of a week one.
Answering your mail on all the week one weirdness in my FMIA column. Send your questions/comments/incredulities (and that means you, Brownaholics) to peterkingfmia@gmail.com this evening.
Your column rocks, @GGramling_SI. So glad to have it this morning. https://t.co/e3fcWA8mZ5
Sunday, pre-100th season of the @Packers, I’ll have a story on @SNFonNBC on @AaronRodgers12 + pal Bart Starr. https://t.co/HCOg3WScoG
Just watched @AaronRodgers12/Bart Starr piece for @SNFonNBC. Touching. Terrific job, @MarissaAni and Kristen Gerringer. — Touching, how close Rodgers, 34, and Starr, 84, are. -- Pack fans, football fans … watch this Sunday around 7:45 pm ET.
Team @TheMMQB is doing a great job, as evidenced by the terrific coverage of @AlbertBreer, @JennyVrentas and @ConorOrr in Philly last night. I left the Linc press box at 2:50 am, and they were all still there, writing. Respect to them. https://t.co/6WvaNsLG8q
Interested in your reactions to these game pods. Want ‘em? Rather have longer conversations? Tell me: peterkingfmia@gmail.com
My deadline podcast from the Falcons-Eagles game … pre-game in the nutty Linc parking lot … post-game with @JOEL9ONE …  my game story … and a conversation with the new Vike QB, @KirkCousins8. Fun pod. https://t.co/WQFRkITOCF
Bad challenge.

Good for @Nike, making @Kaepernick7 a star athlete in their ad galaxy. Because he is a star athlete, whether he is hired to be one or not.
Not just saying this because I admire and like Reich. Saying it because I have seen him in action: Reich, if given the chance, will be a very good long-term coach for the Colts. https://t.co/Ruk9czBPLg
Chi-GB Sunday night at Lambeau. They’ve played 196 times in the regular- and post-season. Score: Packers   3,377 Bears       3,377 https://t.co/c4eEi1GrBb
Everyone’s entitled to their opinion. You know mine. https://t.co/DaciVHWAjt
Would you pay 10.67% of your cap for the best pass-rusher in football over the next 7 years? I would. Bears fans should be euphoric this morning.
You do not build a championship team by trading Khalil Mack in his prime, even for two ones. Read the history of Raider top picks in FMIA. — BTW: Mack, 27, has a league-best 175 sacks/pressures/QB since opening day 2016. — Colossal error, IMO. https://t.co/c4eEi1GrBb
In today's FMIA column at @NBCSports, you'll find: • The massive Mack mistake by Oakland • A SB53 pick that'll be wrong in 5 months  • And predictions for MVP, top rookies too • Approval rating for Rog? Not high • Hey! Football in 3 days. Get ready:  https://t.co/yE7Xjyw6tl https://t.co/OyZVQdTuOs

Roger Goodell took over as NFL commissioner 13 years ago this weekend (Sept. 1). Overall, do you approve or disapprove of his performance in office?   Send Goodell-related comments to peterkingfmia@gmail.com. Will use a few in my column Monday.
Including a mid-spot sound bite from … a punter. https://t.co/2dU6OGuROP

Hey, listen. I can tell you this book is really good, really interesting, packed with fun Pearlmanisms. Very, very much worth your money. You will lay in bed open it, say, “I’ll read for 20 minutes and go to sleep,” and next thing you know, it’s 3:20 am and you’ll be transfixed. https://t.co/9ut5E07nxn
Teddy should be thrilled. No idea if he ends up long-term with Saints—and likely he doesn’t. But this is a perfect place for him for this year. Allows him to advance his game with a really smart offensive mind. Working with Brees is great for him too. https://t.co/yOBNEn1sEL
Oh, I don’t think it’s dumb. I think Sean Payton knows what he’s doing. Sometimes teams get infatuated with guys (Rams, Sammy Watkins) and we’ll see how it works out. https://t.co/cboYXYLgjd
The Teddy Bridgewater trade from the Jets to Saints is one of the most interesting trades I’ve seen in the league in a while. Many reasons. -Brees is durable. -Payton loves Taysom Hill. -Saints gave a 3. - Shows how much Payton values QB position+how much value Bridgewater has.

All politics are local. Vast majority of Hall of Fame arguments are local. I’ve seen it for 26 years.
Yes. I appreciate what he did as the father of modern officiating and he has an excellent case for the Hall. Officiating people thing McNally should be a lock.

FMIA in hands of ace ed @dombonvissuto. Should be up by 1:15 am ET.
I don’t know, but 24 percent of my column tomorrow, at the top, is on Gruden and the team, with one of the most interesting practice drills I’ve seen. This week’s pod, dropping Wednesday, features Jordy Nelson. He’s a Raider. https://t.co/P0gryRrCo7
The pre-complaints are always fun. https://t.co/ws7kouoBaZ
821 Ram words, actually. More to come next week with a longer item. https://t.co/LUOpEiWFLM
It’s in there. https://t.co/Kd8zdvHBIc
In Football Morning in America in a few hrs: Jon Gruden Tom Cruise David Njoku (and an F-bomb) Dak Jaylon Smith Doug Pederson Mike Lombardi Jalen Ramsey Corey Coleman (and his shoes) Josh Rosen Philip Rivers (and his commute) Aretha Sam Darnold Trevor Matich Tuh-rod Mark McGwire
Gruden3 Tuck rule, continued: "That's a complete joke. Where's the tuck rule today, Peter? It's not even in the game. When you overturn a play for a rule like that, that's no way to lose a game. Especially a playoff game. It is what it is, as they say today."
Gruden2: On the tuck rule: “That's probably a big reason I'm never gonna be a fan of instant replay. You know? Instant replay was to correct an obvious wrong. I don't know how they worded it. I only use two-syllable words. But they shouldn’t have overturned that play.”
Gruden1: You’ll read about Jon Gruden on the tuck rule game (his last game as a Raiders coach before this year) Monday in my column. A preview:
Tonight’s Football Morning in America writing music: https://t.co/G4YPUtujcn — Thanks, Aretha.
How possibly was this not overturned? It was a forward pass attempt. Writing about what appears to be a sea change in the interpretation of replay in my Monday column, Football Morning in America. https://t.co/F0MLWIRYec
A’s 1 game behind the Astros. Of all the stories in sports in 2018, Oakland being a game behind the WS champs on Aug. 18 is pretty major.

32 flags. Lord almighty. Nails on the chalkboard.
GLENDALE, Ariz.-We say it every year, and it won't change. Paying full prices for preseason football: insane. Tonight at Az: 1. 32 penalties called (26 accepted, for 165 yds). 2. Five flags in last 1:50. 3. 3 hours, 37 mins. 4. Starting QBs combined to throw 1 pass. Serenity now.
Proud of my partner @dombonvissuto for partnering with a caring @Astros pitcher tonight in Houston. Lucky to know you, Dom. https://t.co/LdztFyR7Bk

My bet is yes. Seems like there’s progress happening there. Rams are pretty reasonable organization. https://t.co/i1jVFavgzA
Absolutely yes. Like the Texans a lot. https://t.co/D1xQArtYX8
Hello! Thanks for following and reading. https://t.co/HptrMxlvVf
They might, but he wouldn’t. He’s moved on with his life—that’s my reading of the situation after spending time with him at that Tahoe golf tournament. https://t.co/DfTiLW8blt
Will have some Lions stuff in there. Yes. https://t.co/ZgwQ57eRxz
Great question. I know the Titans will use them both in all phases. I say whoever’s the hot hand gets the most touches. My bet is Henry. https://t.co/Veq1cSa47Y
13.82% https://t.co/TQSFPjR59y
Seems premature. Offense has to adjust to LaFleur’s offense. Mariota has to be better. Much, much tougher division. https://t.co/oTG8FAj7wz
Great question. There isn’t a can’t-miss guy. I’d have picked Mayfield first in the class, but Cleveland’s been a QB graveyard. I’d redshirt him. https://t.co/McGHfqYI61
Will see them Saturday night. Pretty bullish, though the Henry injury really hurts. Thought he’d have caught 75 balls this year. https://t.co/hEYkIbiTRr
Not too hard when the team is 47 over .500. https://t.co/f7uppXf5JV
Don’t think so. Cowboys saw too much to believe in so far to give up on him if he’s so-so this year. https://t.co/BUZyjFTA7g
Thanks. My best guess is no. Best guess is McCown. https://t.co/H2nVCHgXGk
Baker Mayfield. https://t.co/3DRdArKcKe
Pretty sure I did already. https://t.co/NQZRWMog2Q
Philly-Jacksonville, Oct. 28. That, and GB-Rams in LA, are the two games of the week that week. https://t.co/v7Relp9O2M
Could you repeat that question, and phrase it in English? https://t.co/7yQY9tcl01
Multiple ones, especially now with a very steady guy, Easton, gone for the year at guard. https://t.co/JNuxUmKGaW
Not that I know of. https://t.co/Rx4KJoNVch
Doubt it. He seems like a level-headed guy. I remember @emilymkaplan’s story for @themmqb pre-draft and came away thinking he had a smart and even-keel approach. https://t.co/cQw25gdSd2
Watson. Big star in the making. https://t.co/Ntzswq6iRt
Really like him. Let’s see how he copes with a touch first-half sked: Eli/Odell, Brady, Mahomes, Watson, Wentz. https://t.co/WSL2nFVB6M
1. I would be shocked if Mark Davis traded his cornerstone defensive star. Big mistake if he did it. 2. Yes. Niners, from a distance, look good enough to play in January. https://t.co/0gQtMymJVS
Not Dez Bryant, from what I hear. I’d pick up Jordan Matthews if I were them, and rehab him back from what isn’t a serious injury. https://t.co/SzKL8tSDjf
I doubt it. But one thing about McDermott so far: He’s shown he’ll play the best guy, regardless of salary or draft position. These preseason games are vital to that call. https://t.co/9jnKOzAjcu

EAGAN, Minn.-Minnesota Nice. Helmet sticker for Tony Sparano. https://t.co/TqFGRH3Zne
Feck hired me to cover Xavier basketball/backup Reds/local colleges. Schottelkotte critiqued my stories, advised me to always look underneath rocks. Tremendous influence on me. And I am not alone. Godspeed, Jim. https://t.co/Q9EFkKrldI
The Cincinnati Enquirer had a soft policy in 1980 of not hiring writers out of college, believing they should get experience first at smaller papers. Schottelkotte had hired me as an intern in 1978. He believed in me. He went to editor Luke Feck and said we need to hire this kid.
RIP Jim Schottelkotte. He gave me my start in this business in Cincinnati. Luckily, recently, I got to tell him what he means to me and how much I owe him. Such a good and principled man. https://t.co/Q9EFkKrldI
Yes. And now that we have hijacked the process to feed our gigantic egos, we will never give it back! https://t.co/7oqkIUe9O2

INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev.-So my grandson Freddy wanted to help me pilot the rented boat on Lake Tahoe. What would you have said? https://t.co/EFnBqtvaM5
Two weeks from this morning, my first Monday column will be up at NBC. July 16. https://t.co/DpIxNDtbl5
Great thread, @MichaelDavSmith. https://t.co/bhsAkiOsvI
Presented with comment. Proud of the men and women who do such an honorable job every day. https://t.co/r9TFFEoYnW
Master of his craft, this @GregBishopSI. His Tyler Hilinski story is perfect, and perfectly sad: https://t.co/gyr35J45iC
Excellent work on Greg Hardy, @RobertKlemko. A well-rounded portrait. https://t.co/uw0QVV8J9e
Hey @CydZeigler: Be proud. You’re a driving force in sports people being proud of who they are. You’re a good man. https://t.co/X7afABvFYR
Surprised today, but always knew he might walk after he got to the pinnacle of his profession, the Super Bowl. Big loss for the NFL. Big gain for CBS, if he goes there. https://t.co/10GZQzk3FK
Really good story, and really good California Week series, by the indefatigable @Andy_Benoit. https://t.co/B3XT2473ak
My new podcast is up. @DeionSanders on his baseball life, @danpfeiffer of @PodSaveAmerica on the lessons for all livelihoods from his new book. https://t.co/b4HWkj6aAh
Good to see @dak. He is a big baseball fan. https://t.co/4uewsKgkM1
Tomorrow my last pre-camp pod drops. On “The Peter King Podcast,” @danpfeiffer of @PodSaveAmerica on his new book and lessons for all from a public life … and @DeionSanders, on his fascinating baseball career, and life.
Hey @GrantWahl: You are fantastic. https://t.co/6WMM7Eppd6
New Twitter handle: @peter_king.
So impressed with @AlbertBreer’s column today, at such a dead time of the offseason. Good for him, getting so much (Cam, GB) fresh stuff. https://t.co/OSnaslgHcD
Batting fifth for the Cards … playing first base … I’M KEITH HERNANDEZ. @keithhernandez, that is. https://t.co/ai6u9oALcc
I attended this game. Sat in the AP seats a few rows behind home plate. Vivid memories …  Leading off: Lou Brock, Pete Rose. Seaver wasn’t overpowering. Struck out only 3 or 4. But so efficient. Very fast game. Lonesome George Hendrick grounded to 1B for last out. https://t.co/0LjNCXfkrE
My 5 picks: 1 “Beartown,” by Fredrik Backman 2 “Bobby Kennedy,” by Chris Matthews 3 “Killers of the Flower Moon,” by David Grann 4 “The Rooster Bar,” by John Grisham 5 "Tiger Woods,” by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian https://t.co/ucuCjHfe8B

Podcast with @MadDogUnleashed up. This was fun. The pod’s got a new name too. https://t.co/88MuxlookD
Just saw @MrRogersMovie. First thought: Wow. Second thought: I cried a lot. This is a terrific doc on an important figure in our country.
Proud of you, @Andrea_Kremer, for an honor so well deserved. Congrats! https://t.co/1ADV7q38aD
Hey, my pod’s got a new name. “The Peter King Podcast” is up. This week’s guest: Chris “Mad Dog” Russo.  https://t.co/b4HWkj6aAh https://t.co/DHhNvqe5pG
That’s it for me. I’ve got more on the bookshelf to read, but I hope you choose reading this Fathers Day. (“Killers of the Flower Moon” is quite something.)
Fathers Day book 5 “Tiger Woods,” by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian. If I taught a reporting class, I’d make young students read this. How could our most written-about athlete have so many skeletons, so much we didn't know? Take a bow, Benedict and Keteyian. This book is great.
Fathers Day book 4 “The Rooster Bar,” by John Grisham. If you know me, I’m a sucker for Grisham. This is one of his best of recent times. DC law school debt mounts, and bright/misguided students find a devious way to make some dough … and the tale ends (far too soon) in Africa.
Fathers Day book 3 “Killers of the Flower Moon,” by David Grann A spellbinding tale of brazen multiple Native American murders on Osage land in Oklahoma 90-plus years ago. Tremendously researched. I can’t recommend the history and the gripping murder story enough. Read this.
Fathers Day book 2 “Bobby Kennedy,” by Chris Matthews. The loss of Kennedy to this country is inestimable. Read Matthews on Kennedy’s 1967 trip to the Deep South; see how moved he was by the poverty. Matthews thinks Kennedy would have fought tirelessly for racial equality.
Fathers Day Book 1: “Beartown,” by Fredrik Backman. Terrific, disturbing speed-read about hockey’s grip on a small Swedish town, and how the addiction to the game warps good people. Sports are fun. Sports are not life. Great lessons here. Could not put this book down.
Each summer, for Fathers Day, I write some quickie book reviews so you might be able to buy Dad/Uncle/Grandpa or another good man a book instead of a tie. Why? Reading is fun! No column this year, but I do have 5 book recommendations. Here they are, over 5 quick Tweets:
Great job, @AZCardinals. This is awesome. https://t.co/69JtIMq9Xa
Yes. Posting those, here, today at 5 pm ET. https://t.co/BXGJehz3J0
Congrats to @NFLCharean, a real pro in every sense. https://t.co/OHGpvSEDeE
Tasks. — Player plays his career. Five years pass. Voters decide if he makes HoF. — Period. If he goes to ceremony, he goes. If he doesn’t, he doesn’t. Does not matter. We all move on. https://t.co/xC91Rs13mw
I could. https://t.co/o8DWD1QwtV
Surprised to read this. I have never heard one voter say the behavior of an enshrinee after the vote would have anything to do with his/her vote. Certainly would have zero to do with mine. https://t.co/B0OhBgrdFe

Smith-Pelly scored the biggest goal of his life, and when the puck crossed the line, he had neither of his skates on the ice. This game is awesome.

How do you know they weren’t? https://t.co/TGFz3uwReC
The 48 voters are charged with voting on a player’s playing career. Nothing else. To consider anything else goes against the bylaws and, in my opinion, common sense.
Don’t see why. It would not have changed my vote, or thought process, one infinitesimal iota. https://t.co/460ZAspSpb
Re @terrellowens choosing to be 1st living enshrinee to skip HoF fete: 1 Free country. Certainly his right. 2 Glad he’s in. 3 Life goes on.

@ChrisBurkeNFL Hey Chris, thanks a lot for the kind words. Really appreciate them. It is presumptuous of those who have some degree of power to tell those they don’t know intimately, “This is what you should do.” As I see from reading you on the Leos a lot now, you made the best call for you.

I’ll address in my column, @geoffschwartz. But the real change is this: I worked for a weekly from ’89-‘97. In ’97, it became a weekly with an internet column. In ’09 (for me), minute-by-minute Twitter got added. In ’17, we became a 24/7 NFL operation. In 20 years, a revolution. https://t.co/oYnuZ6LFUi

That’s the point of the @kalynkahler reporting here. Glad it affected you. https://t.co/HuzHQz8XKM
As usual, the cornucopia from @AlbertBreer is rich in NFL knowledge, particularly about why Pat Shurmur buys Eli Manning in the twilight. https://t.co/fCu7PlFYlq

Not to me. Say you’re a smart person. Does that mean that everything you say is smart? Or once in a while, in some moment of pique, could you say something not smart, or something you might regret? I’ve done it a lot. https://t.co/4eINYwYNmj
True. It’s also why 36-year-old QBs (and 40-year-old QBs) should have no say in the draft process. https://t.co/GF3ZXG1sY4
The essence of the decision. https://t.co/jEcpcRhlTN
Did not do that. I said for a 36-yr-old QB to question the drafting of a quarterback in the 3d round when he has openly talked of retirement was unintelligent. Which is true. https://t.co/c2TzAxVacW

Nothing too complicated. Will explain it all in my column Monday. Just felt it was time. Got a great staff and I was always going to cast too long a shadow. They are ready to be great on their own. https://t.co/wPCBGMkxio
Yes. For the rest of May @theMMQB. Vacation in June. Then sometime in July for NBC. I’ll keep you posted. https://t.co/oCzolfRdsc
That was an intense basketball game. Even I liked it!
Um, okay. Thanks. Glad I can keep doing it. It’s sort of my favorite thing to do. https://t.co/e1V7iHwjuj
Thanks, @Ernieiceman. (Love your handle.) But I’ll still be doing my column and still be doing my podcasts. Will let you know where to find them. https://t.co/JhCzUAzioG
Sometimes I hate the reach of @darrenrovell. But he did catch me at my best 40 years ago this summer. What do you think Johnny Bench thought when this nerd walked into the Reds clubhouse? https://t.co/mRtFVAHlud
I feel like I’m at my own funeral. You’re so nice. Thank you. — Not retiring, though (perhaps to the chagrin of many). Will be writing my Monday column for NBC starting in July. — Emotional day. Love where I’ve been (SI, The MMQB), love where I’m going (NBC).
Thank you, @SINow.
Truth: It was beer supplied by me, and I chose the @GLBC_Cleveland Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale. A fine local brew. Discovered it at Progressive Field during frigid Tribe tilt Wednesday night. https://t.co/Pmo7nR2vVu
“That’s our dude.” The moment Dorsey knew, in @SINow this week. https://t.co/kvbNlSVNcS
Great job on a touching story, @SI_ChrisBallard. https://t.co/IKmM6uXEt7
Saturday night, drinking a Great Lakes beer post-draft, John Dorsey looked at me and vowed: “We will awaken the sleeping giant.” My @SINow story on the Browns. https://t.co/9qgpiUiq9I

Great job, @JennyVrentas, with this inside story of a grateful son—and high draft choice. https://t.co/GkKFI5vRta
Fruitless speculation. If Mayfield’s your clear QB1, and if there’s even a 5% percent chance of Mayfield going 2 or 3, you can’t do it. https://t.co/rhkWK98c3j
Sometimes you don’t have options, and taking anything is better than staying at 10 and eschewing at least some value and getting your player 5 slots later. Happened to Polian+Carolina w/first pick in 1995. https://t.co/3JUrCsuJi0
No idea what the Raiders’ board said. Lots of different grades on the OL this year. By the way, @geoffschwartz, that is one cute Mickey meeting. Great job! https://t.co/FaC56UyWG5
NEW YORK-“Enough of this draft, sir. I need my walk.” Yes Chuck. Let’s go. https://t.co/PQsvb4Eu3U
I think you’re right. After losing out on McGlinchey (assuming they did), Oak knew 10 as waaaay too high for Kolton, so they moved down, got Martavis and another OT prospect. Still a great trade for Keim and Cards. https://t.co/DV2eFbRD0K
Thanks, @WillBrinson. Plus: Fairly amazing that, in the end, Browns couldn’t get a big offer for the 4th pick in the draft. Pre-draft buzz was way off there. https://t.co/fydlgg4Sk0

Coming @theMMQB: Me on the Bills and Cards. @JennyVrentas on round 1. @AlbertBreer on round 2 mock. @RobertKlemko on Lamar. And more. Hang out for all the fun.
Our @Andy_Benoit is out with his feelings on every pick in the first round. He likes the Ravens. He does not like the Colts. https://t.co/NzlIK5CRy3

My worst first round ever. One pick right: Saquon. Man, I smell.
Bills GM Brandon Beane on his long phone call with the repentant Josh Allen Thursday afternoon: “You could hear the tears on the other line.” — More on the two teams, Buffalo and Arizona, that energized the first round with QB trades, soon @TheMMQB.
Shazier. Wow.
Lord, that is a strong defensive front for the Bucs. Gerald McCoy must be over the moon.

OAKLAND-Freddy’s first ballgame, and what a great setting for it. Lovely day by the bay. Full of pride. https://t.co/TOsP5xTSdR
Here’s a cool draft factoid: In 1964, Wichita State tackle Bill Parcells was drafted 89th, by Detroit. Navy quarterback Roger Staubach was drafted 40 picks later, by Dallas.
That’s your opinion. I disagree, obviously. You don’t know who the FOD was. If it’s his barber, you should be angry for me using it. But you should probably know I wouldn’t have used that without it being someone credible. https://t.co/LYB5P9b6n1
Some still do, Michael. But look at how three of the first four picks here are controlled by guys who could work for the CIA (Dorsey, Gettleman). You get nothing out of them. (Understandably, I might add.) We all still have guys who tell us things, but it’s just more guarded now. https://t.co/rq54jATJTE
You’re welcome. I just want you to know—and this is not a “pre-excuse,” but a simple fact—that the mock business these days has a high degree of throwing darts. Back in the day, we had a real chance at many of these picks. Now teams are significantly more secretive. https://t.co/TyU64uMFEz

Okay. In the last two years, 36 players have more catches, and 28 have more receiving yards. Not much better. https://t.co/ru3WfLOCUu
Re the @DezBryant release: 57 players have more catches, and 42 have more receiving yards, than Bryant over the last 3 years. He turns 30 this season. Pretty logical move by Cowboys.
I am thrilled for journalism, artful storytelling and Humboldt that @GregBishopSI, reporting from Saskatchewan, has captured a town and a country so perfectly. https://t.co/7PWtXIikSp
This is the kind of fun exercise that capture how teams in the top half of the draft are trying to whittle down their mocks. Thanks to @bettemarston for executing a fun idea, and also to @AlbertBreer for playing along and the strong intel. https://t.co/Hbwnj1BznL
Really cool way to illustrate the great talent of Shaquem Griffin, and how he has overcome his disability, by @AlbertBreer. https://t.co/LXjyyIOi8M
What he said. https://t.co/JaKeZSCiPt
The takeaway from @AlbertBreer is that the top of the draft is still very fluid. Buff works out Sam Darnold Friday. Cleve hosts Josh Allen today. And “Gettleman is holding the cards.” https://t.co/e2UsEQonWV
No one’s got a handle on the top of the draft like @AlbertBreer. That, plus his fine Thursday cornucopia, is right here. https://t.co/mrxJehjsv2

That is the  eternal fate of the Pedroias. https://t.co/KlWWc3iSaQ
Took Pedroia in the 25th and final round. I’ve had him every season since he came up. I can’t stop now. He probably won’t play, but he’s Pedroia. He’s the captain of the Montclair Pedroias.
The Montclair Pedroias, 2018: 1b Freeman, Alonso 2b Dozier, Pedroia ss Gregorious, DeJong 3b Rendon c WCastillo OF Betts, Benintendi, Duvall, Margot, Altherr, WCalhoun P Arrieta, Bauer, Bundy, Stroman, Gray, Duffy RP Kimbrel, Knebel, Jones, Parker.
Road trip to Jersey. Tonight’s my baseball draft. I’ve got Betts, Freeman, BDozier to start my team. Help me, please. @SultanofStat has been a huge help. @PeteAbe the Pats fan and @TylerKepner the Eagles fan too. But who do you love? Advice, please.

Terrific examination of @bakermayfield using advanced analytics and something I’d never heard of: the AIG.  https://t.co/jCIfI8e5Gy Strongly recommended.
The Giants have no home-grown vets they drafted between 5th and 10th seasons, theoretically when they should be franchise backbones. NE has 9. Atl, Pitt, Phil have 8 each. https://t.co/PC7KGWjz1w
Our @kalynkahler with a fun tick-tock of what it’s like to be traded in the NFL. The tradee: fellow NU Wildcat @TrevorSiemian. (@darrenrovell/@Espngreeny Story of the Week) https://t.co/vBWJG09to6
From the six draft classes of 2008 to 2013, the Giants are 0 for 45. Zero players left. Pugh and Pierre-Paul were the last two. https://t.co/fedeEdHTeg

Great nugget from @ConorOrr’s weekly draft column: @bakermayfield had the best QB rating among top QBs in draft last season—and it’s not close. https://t.co/HRaO4ApWVU
Sorry. I meant @JamesPalmerTV. https://t.co/IF149p7L2t
Cousins and Josh McCown have the same agent. You think his agent would let Cousins sign with Jets? https://t.co/FKUkRcj0Nh
Our @jjones9 on the scene in Raleigh with Bradley Chubb. https://t.co/ZkDRU9xCVC
Sorry I didn’t know this when I wrote on Monday, @JamesPalmer. You deserve the kudos for reporting Broncos never made an offer to Cousins. https://t.co/TNJ2SrtX9T
Attaway, @ConorOrr. Good story on who won and lost so far. https://t.co/k9T6PHcwrB
Good evening, all. A few little notes from the column, ICYMI: Bills were in on McCown. Colts could deal down again. Siemian is Fitzpatrick. Saints have a sleep room. Thanks, Retrievers. https://t.co/2MUZn9IZgb

I truly have no idea. Gettleman has cement lips, and rightfully so. Only helps himself by keeping outside world in NFL guessing. https://t.co/0VgUvUHDXp
Silent auctions work. They make you make your best offer immediately. In the case of Denver, the Broncos knew the Jets figured blow them out of the water and didn’t want to risk losing Keenum. https://t.co/GX1HixdGEU

In MMQB in the morning: Why @KirkCousins8 chose the Vikings, from the meticulous journal of @MikeMcCartney7. “There will be no discounts,’’ he said.
Our @AlbertBreer on the big trade, in the league that never sleeps. https://t.co/rFjW9qIr78
If they get a franchise QB, it’s a good trade. https://t.co/ojQMPXI5yG
Three quick thoughts on Ind-NYJ trade: 1 Colts did great, getting 3 2’s to drop 3 spots with QB wasn’t a need for them. 2 If Jets get QB of future (won’t know till 2019), it’s not too much. 3. Bills cannot be happy.
Attaway, John Harbaugh. https://t.co/ISkCcq1rtF
Thank @SeanPayton. We’ve done a lot of these first-person columns in the 5-year history of @TheMMQB. I don’t recall one where the author line-edited the column himself and struggled to find the right words throughout. Very interesting. https://t.co/c3JFXg0Ij9

Really interesting point from Sean Payton, in his column on the late Tom Benson: He says NFL people he will not name urged Benson to fire Payton after Bountygate. Benson refused. https://t.co/PfgPQqmaiV

Re the future of the Saints, am being told the succession plan is in place, and Benson’s widow, Gayle Benson, will assume ownership of the Saints.
RIP, Tom Benson, who did so much for New Orleans and loved his football team.

Phew. That’s a late MMQB for the offseason. (What offseason?) @RSherman_25 topping a busy weekend in the league. Interesting anecdote from inside the negotiations between Sherman and Niners. Good night.
Crazy top to MMQB. “Vengeful" @RSherman_25 (his word), @JohnLynch49ers on the deal that sent the classic Seahawk to the dreaded #49ers. Writing now.

Ship sailed. But recruiting @RSherman_25 to be our player columnist in 2013 was one of the best decisions in @theMMQB history. https://t.co/4E16Zhn1IV
Life goes on. Football teams whack high-priced vets all the time. The @RSherman_25 one feels different. Watching the Seahawks without Sherman will be like watching the Saints without Brees, the Cards without Fitzgerald.
I believe @RSherman_25 did more to establish the Seahawks’ identity as a we-take-no-crap team and was the defensive keystone for the best D of this era. Good columnist too. https://t.co/CNtRZBjiVT

Sadly, I think the Rams are done trading. A shame. They have only five sixth-round picks in April. Was hoping they’d be able to get to 6.
You did one heck of a job on this story, @JulietMacur. https://t.co/lbQRAP0LIJ
Les Snead has made 4 trades that can’t be official till the start of the league year. That is 6 days away. Rams are playing by different rules than everyone else.

Ignorance is bliss. https://t.co/RiM0zxdWRn
Prior to this snap, Pats hadn’t played 4 DTs in goal-line formation in the playoffs. It was a different look than Seattle had seen in all its pre-SB scouting. Seattle had 1 TE, 3 WR on the field. It was not a run formation even against normal NE goal-line D. https://t.co/OH2Rq5BV4C

Yeah, I liked it too. A little controversial. Needed: consciences. https://t.co/yfOBDrk9TU
From the Sebastian Janikowski section in MMQB today: — Raiders have had 21 coaches in their history. Janikowski played for 10 of them. https://t.co/n7WK0vSUlO
Not really Peter King guesses he signs with the Broncos. https://t.co/4rUNrTXvOy
Good morning. MMQB is up. https://t.co/kORworwcND
Hi. My Monday column is live. (Yes, it's still Sunday.) https://t.co/kORworNNFb https://t.co/n7WK0wavdm
MMQB will be up by midnight. Have a good night, everyone.
Is there ever anything that doesn’t begin and end with him? Ever? Ever? https://t.co/ETc9kwzR1e
Interesting. Thanks, @WesleyLowery. https://t.co/CzRMRrRBiI
Could not have said it better, Michael. Thank you. https://t.co/KvC1HZq3F9
This is the kind of idiot we need to rise up against. https://t.co/2TN238I896
America’s with you, Emma Gonzalez. At least the part of America with a collective conscience. https://t.co/4Z57JO0gth
Thanks to my hosts at Ohio U this weekend for the Bob Moran Sports symposium. An honor to keynote the weekend. Good hanging with @ThePost journos Friday night too.
On Tuesday, 16 days after winning his second Super Bowl ring, @JOEL9ONE and a team of players and military vets will begin a climb of Kilimanjaro. Some way to celebrate winning SB52. https://t.co/6I7JEQRJwv
Thank God we lost, @TessQuinlan. https://t.co/RfxKzsdHBJ
Good data, good take by our @kalynkahler. https://t.co/bHYbq0Q1qq
Man, @ConorOrr with a very good job putting @LarryFitzgerald’s excellence in perspective. https://t.co/lfDafRLuTm
Tim, I am glued to the screen every night. It’s fun to immerse yourself in something new. Couldn’t stay awake long enough for Chen and Shiffrin last night. https://t.co/dnZqfABNVr
Really good story, @SITimLayden. Explains everything about a sport that takes emotion, energy and your absolute best. Answered all my questions about Shiffrin. https://t.co/QQwzdl3wcf
I’m not going to stick to sports. I am a human being. What is happening is horrific. Tell the parents of the students in Florida about stats of households with guns. https://t.co/gFA2c4wmTG

Thanks Vito. Respect your opinion. My point is, I am tired of platitudes and words. They do nothing. We need action from Washington and we need it now. https://t.co/JRkR5uUQXr
This week on the pod: @brandongraham55, Super Bowl hero, and someone you should know—Bob Angelo of NFL Films. One of the all-time greats at Films, he retired after SB52 after 43 years. https://t.co/xbgPewPPEm
Make sure you read this one: https://t.co/hENaD5qhEy We’ll be discussing Friday evening. Look forward to seeing you in Athens. https://t.co/fkve3cYICl
Another in our @baker_mayfield6 pre-draft series from @RobertKlemko: What’s the real story of what happened in his first college season, at Texas Tech? https://t.co/FCiuV8TTa1
Good detail, as usual, in @AlbertBreer’s cornucopia from around a busy league. https://t.co/j6sT4Pi8kr
Speak, senator. https://t.co/mYjFl70IrU
Stop defending inertia. Stop saying we are powerless. We are the United States of America. We have crises, and we work to fix them. We don’t throw our hands in the air and continue letting our schoolchildren die.
Whoever says: —“A gun didn’t do this; a sick person did.” —“Thoughts and prayers to all the families.” —“Now is not the time to discuss gun control.” Get lost. Get off my feed. You are not part of the America we need to strive for.
None of that at all. I am simply answering the question that many people ask about the possibility of getting a premium return for a guy who by October (and maybe by opening day) will be a one-season backup. I absolutely think they should not trade him, regardless of offer. https://t.co/LmHEaKWL0K
I doubt sincerely they’d trade him for anything, and I doubt anyone offers 2 ones for him. But I believe it would take at least 2 ones for them to even think about it. Chances of Foles being an Eagle in Sept.: 95.82%. https://t.co/5Q00l37JbO
Shoot. You are right. Stupid me. Will fix in the column. https://t.co/sXWVeE6VpZ
Among those atop @Andy_Benoit’s FA rankings with the market 3 wks away: LT Nate Solder (coming off an excellent SB52), LB Nigel Bradham, RB LeVeon Bell, CB Trumaine Johnson. https://t.co/OQ4uwjrgBV Excellent rankings.
Here’s @themmqb’s Draft Board, 10 weeks before the NFL Draft. There’s a guard ahead of all the quarterbacks. https://t.co/QXnWVEj8yr

Not often that you exit a big game and think the Patriots erred in a coaching way. SB52 was one of those rare times. https://t.co/Yjh9ZQoQyz
First time I’ve heard the honest, unfiltered, spy-vs-spy dissection of an NFL play, any play, from birth to development to adoption to calling it … and this was the game-winning play of SB52. Hope you enjoy this. https://t.co/Yjh9ZQ7fH1
Who pissed in your corn flakes? https://t.co/p5nv2EUy05
For #Eagles fans, 12 sweet and historic words: “Gun trey left, open buster star motion … 383 X follow Y slant.’’ — Class in session. Professors Pederson, Reich and Groh teaching the play the won Super Bowl 52. https://t.co/Yjh9ZQ7fH1
“Nick!” Pederson said into Nick Foles’ helmet. “Wristband 145. Wristband 145!” https://t.co/Yjh9ZQoQyz
Good morning. MMQB is up. https://t.co/Yjh9ZQ7fH1
A different, fun (I hope) and educational MMQB today. Have a good day, everyone. https://t.co/Yjh9ZQ7fH1
Good evening. My Monday Morning Quarterback column is live: https://t.co/hENaD5HSw6 https://t.co/Yjh9ZQoQyz
MMQB in hands of ace ed @dombonvissuto. Should be up by 11 pm ET. Colts fans, you’ll want to see your new head coach. Frank Reich is in full view.
Meow. https://t.co/rqCiDcpESL
Here’s your new head coach, Indianapolis*, in his last act as an Eagles coach—explaining the winning TD in the Super Bowl for MMQB tomorrow. — — * Reich has to sign first. This part has been an issue for the Colts. https://t.co/iorSsvDmu9
Hard to find a more deserving guy that Reich. https://t.co/IOSvujNBLc
In the middle of writing about "Play 145." These are the kinds of stories that make me love my job. https://t.co/iorSsvDmu9
PHILADELPHIA-This was a fun day. Eagles OC Frank Reich teaching how the winning TD in SB52 happened. Joining us this morning: Doug Pederson and WR coach Mike Groh, also involved in the production of the Ertz TD. Football fans + nerds alike: MMQB is going to be really fun Monday. https://t.co/kgShLCkWdh
Hey @SITimLayden! How’s it going over there? I covered the last Olympics there. Looks like technology has improved a bit. https://t.co/6ccTadNQ1c
RIP, Jim Garrett. Dad, mentor, coach, scout, educator. All fit him well. “Educator” would make him proudest. https://t.co/UX9qiyKvAJ
Excellent job, @AlbertBreer. https://t.co/WgVqkKylmb
Great reporting here by @adamschefter. Seems like $37m cap number for Garoppolo in first year. Smart when Niners had $100m in cap room in ’18. https://t.co/7c6aV61CiP
Good for you, Kiko Alonso. Good work. https://t.co/NK6R3i97bb
Second in our Baker Mayfield series, from @RobertKlemko. This week, his likely landing spots, in order, heading into evaluation season. https://t.co/AbJfKO6uvY
Great story, @BobKlap. Journalism with empathy here. Congrats. Good luck to Bud. https://t.co/D1YmUS6eKq
This story of SB52 by @GregBishopSI and @Ben_Baskin contains one of the best ledes I have ever read in SI. 18 months ago, Foles was so sure he wasn’t playing football anymore he hadn’t thrown a ball all offseason. Congrats, men. https://t.co/eycnI8HhTf
Yes. Tweetup? Friday the 3rd? https://t.co/vbVaX0k84m
Came down to Vrabel and McDaniels. Very, very close. Chose McDaniels. The list likely changes a bit because of January events, meaning Reich's rise. https://t.co/tIDg2Qv570
The idea of @DangeRussWilson putting on the pinstripes … Listen to him talk about it. https://t.co/WALl0hfmvW
Perfect Tweet, @HolderStephen. One of the really good and honorable people in the game. https://t.co/lQx4rpbnmU
This guy @DangeRussWilson likes baseball. https://t.co/qenCgWxTCQ
As our @AlbertBreer reports, not even Robert Kraft knew about the Malcolm Butler benching. https://t.co/xmqTlIZRIW via @SINow
Good to spend the time with you, Ryan. No idea how you dealt with 14 hours of me blathering. https://t.co/36ghcnxKlh
In my mailbag, I have the unmitigated gall to advise the Super Bowl champion GM. https://t.co/bWKDLi9ZIz
I am told there is no wording in the Pats’ agreement with McDaniels that he is certain to be the next head coach of the team. Likely, though. https://t.co/CY13Xd9NuH
24 hours ago, Josh McDaniels went to Gillette Stadium to clean out his office. Then .... https://t.co/CY13Xd9NuH
My column on Josh McDaniels is up. https://t.co/qmVXOX0J0o https://t.co/CY13Xd9NuH
Have a good night everyone. I am sick as a dog. I hope when I wake up 35 hours from now I am well. Have my doubts.
No way. Imagine if the 9-to-12 months prognosis about Wentz is more like 10 or 11 months, and you’ve got to play Sudfeld half the year. This is why you got Foles in the first place. https://t.co/SOaJVsUwNM
I’ll have a McDaniels story up by 2 am ET, with fresh details. Did someone say “offseason?"
My non-McDaniels mailbag is up, leading with why the Eagles must not trade Foles, barring a ridiculous offer. https://t.co/fTU6XMRT6t
Our @ConorOrr on the story. This is a wild one. https://t.co/zg2v1AQc9W
Meh. https://t.co/UdIv2mvEeg
You’re not getting a biggie now. Big issue here is, get a stable guy like Reich to come in to Kevin-Bacon it: “ALL IS WELL!" https://t.co/f73dNZKAhn
To: Chris Ballard. From: Peter King. Re: Suddenly vacant coaching job.  Ideas: 1. Call Frank Reich. 2. Or John DeFilippo. 3. Or both. 4. Or Dave Toub.
Yikes. https://t.co/FascBAGqhX
Amazing story. News break by @AdamSchefter. https://t.co/bwreW4wBd8
It’s certainly possible. I doubt it, but I just don’t know for sure. https://t.co/PRxlR4GlNR
With postseason included, I’d have voted Pederson. https://t.co/yrX9ANYmpn
Okay. Now I’ve totally changed my mind. https://t.co/5tpRyRZ3Fj
That is a good point, and as @RobertKlemko points out, Pederson would have been a fair choice if postseason would be a part of the discussion. https://t.co/bZtKyWRpQ1
It’s not embarrassing really. Rules: Regular season only … 50 voters … One coach per voter … How is it embarrassing to vote for McVay, who won 11 after 13 straight Rams non-winning season? Silly. https://t.co/EA5nPflLWJ
One of the great leads you'll read about anything--and a terrific game story, from @GregBishopSI and @Ben_Baskin https://t.co/eycnI8HhTf
Both are bad. These are worse. Teams haven’t held draft meetings to set anything close to final boards, Combine hasn’t happened, Pro Days haven’t happened. https://t.co/obeqw5MFzs

Our @RobertKlemko on the Coach of the Full Year, and two huge plays from Sunday. https://t.co/5zQDCe4TL6
Nothing like the deadline podcast, finished at 4:18 am! Have a slew of Eagles, but also you’ll like Josh McDaniels, on appreciating his time in New England. Listen on the way home from work. https://t.co/pDVDcVwpci
Pederson ethos: “Keep slinging the mud.” Told me his football philosophy post-game. — Also in MMQB: -Owens HoF talk time: 45:18. -I voted for Kramer. -FOX upped TNF ante 33%. -Whither Joe Thomas? -GB v NE in ’18: 2d Rodgers-Brady meeting ever. -MVP 101 months older than COY. https://t.co/eURYdlqlET
Boggled my mind throughout January. https://t.co/xemKaTMW4w

Absolutely agree with @tomecurran. Schiano is a good coach. https://t.co/IyD7Drwgm8
Prescient column by @Andy_Benoit on the huge loss of Malcolm Butler. Mr. Benoit does not approve of the healthy benching. https://t.co/21Fxd284nL
That would make me very proud. @JennyVrentas works so hard and produces quality at all times. So glad she’s on the team. https://t.co/PS8NciMjJX
One last note: My sincere thanks to @kalynkahler and @RobertKlemko for their help with my column today. Read the lead to see what Kalyn found. What a gem. https://t.co/eURYdlqlET
We’re fortunate @theMMQB to have hired @ConorOrr last fall. This story, from the Pats’ locker room, shows you why. “It felt like an ending.” https://t.co/BL9PQ184Em

Been a long time since MMQB, in-season, was finished and filed by 6:32 pm ET on a Sunday. Occasionally, I can actually be responsible. @dombonvissuto will have a humane Sunday evening.

Yes. https://t.co/pENQHTrTUw
One of your faves, and mine too. Thanks a lot, Joel. https://t.co/K9sBvLlrqF

No. Had quite a few calls/texts till getting a new number today, midday. Big highlight: 6 calls buzzing my FitBit at 5:20ish am. Had to take it off. https://t.co/3Ypt19rbho
Best chance is he’ll get to free-agency, and then we’ll see if he wants to stay in DC. https://t.co/rjFYaFyU1Y
Hi everyone. Ten minutes to answer your questions. Anyone have any?
I feel for you. Such an uncharacteristic game for this year’s Vikings. This one is going to take a while to go away. https://t.co/sPwzWeUi9t
I believe @JOEL9ONE is onto something.  MMQB is up. Good morning. https://t.co/Owsyjd0UoD
The other issue: Lewis has a knee on the ground and a hand over the ball—and Jack does not have possession of the ball. Yet. A conundrum of a call.
Michael, I just watched it 12-15 times. One of those calls that’d shows how hard it is to a) officiate correctly; b) get right on replay. But  Jack was not touched while on the ground with the ball. https://t.co/SEUJmTBd92

Chortling at the Eagles and their fans saying they knew Foles had it in him, and deriding those who doubted Foles. Just stop. I mean, what thinking person didn’t doubt Foles entering this game?
Watching the last two drives, I wonder how NE OC Josh McDaniels doesn’t have multiple head-coaching offers. Brady’s the best. We know. And this guy is a great play-caller.
Davis channels his inner Odell. The MAC rocks. Davis (Western Michigan) today. Roethlisberger (Miami), AB maybe (Central Michigan), Mike Mitchell (Ohio U) tomorrow.
Congrats to Frank Reich and Doug Pederson and the Eagles. That was one heck of an offensive gameplan.

For him to sign longterm now, it’s probably have to be $25m/year. That’s why they might franchise him. https://t.co/WAvgIWv01Q
Totally depends on next month. If he wins a couple of games, Vikes will certainly try to sign him. At least franchise him. https://t.co/y9YX3phuiP

Great, great question. The second-tier FAs are always the most valuable. My top 5, off top: 1 Adrian Clayborn, DE 2 Prince Amukamara, CB 3 Connor Barwin, OLB 4 Zach Brown, LB 5 Justin Pugh, T-G https://t.co/BFeSzU1EAb
I don’t mind 10m a year. But for 10 years … wow. That means if either side gets pissed off after, say, 5 years, Mark Davis could have to pay Gruden $50m to not coach. https://t.co/NrCXMEER6H
Robert Kraft, to my knowledge, has never lied to me. In this case, I presented both sides of the story and tried to be as fair as I could. https://t.co/C99uS03gic
How would you get both of them the experience they'd need? If you want to take a second QB in round 3 or 4, fine. But now fourth overall. That’s a franchise player. https://t.co/cOz8mc42GT
I think the best mentor for Trubisky they can find. I’d say Josh McDaniels. But Pat Shurmur would be smart too. https://t.co/rZ0cMIumhu

I don’t know what that means. I do know Kareem Hunt ran for more yards than anyone in football this season, the 2nd rookie in 33 years to do that. https://t.co/3fdO1LRPO3
It is? Kareem Hunt won the rushing title. Hunt had 232 more yards from scrimmage than Kamara. I understand voting for Kamara, who is a great candidate. But it’s a contest. https://t.co/Jr5Rgm6qiI

I could use some help from Buffalo. Anybody out at the airport tonight? What was the scene like? Any contact with players?
My resolution: stop writing 9,000-work MMQBs. I am killing poor @dombonvissuto, not to mention boring most of you to tears.
Hey, Happy New Year. Banging out the column on this interesting Sunday. I guess it was chilly for everyone out there tonight, right?
Yes, I will. https://t.co/TU1B93h6Fr
Next year. Next year. https://t.co/ZawsEytGZy
Just finishing tabulating @theMMQB’s poll of 25 football people for MVP. It’s very close. Results in early 2018 (like, in the third hour of 2018) in MMQB.
You certainly shall. https://t.co/4QOyPOSXDW
On the 45th anniversary of Roberto Clemente’s death, it’s good to remember the sacrifice he made and the life he lived and the ballplayer he was.
Attaway @bettemarston! Have a great day, a great wedding, a great life … and you can take the rest of the day off! https://t.co/QqxOq88XiR
Join me on the SI Facebook page in 2 minutes for my weekly Facebook Live NFL chat. See you there.
Incredible story. An ownership stake, possibly, for a guy who last coached a football game 9 years ago this week. https://t.co/NqJFbR9PRO
Yes. Yes. That’s the only reason. https://t.co/LztN5dDhir
Not even close, but we’re all entitled to our opinions. https://t.co/gqte1TR4qV
This is different. Gotta make the call on a 2-time SB-winning QB, Beckham the phenom manchild, 2nd pick in draft … coming off worst season in franchise history. https://t.co/zO0pn6yHzk
Congrats on your engagement, @Degatron7. @theMMQB Alumni Association cheers you and Jenna.
NYG3: Gettleman: “It’s a big boy league, and I’ve gotta put on the big boy pants. I’m not afraid of these decisions."
NYG2: Biggest thing about this job is the tough calls Gettleman will have to make. Firing Marc Ross was tough, but that will turn out to be about 14th on his list in next 4 months.
NYG1: Just had a good discussion with Dave Gettleman. “One thing I’ve learned from Carolina …’’ he began, and then there were 3 things. MMQB fodder.
He’s heard me say it. I have said it to him 3 or 4 times, most recently in August. https://t.co/D6oJfLyJIu
The Kahler story is all over Reddit. The thread is pretty clear: Viewers want a la carte choices. They’re not paying the big ticket anymore. https://t.co/DgFwHulFc0
Have had tremendous reaction about this why-are-ratings-down piece by @themmqb’s @kalynkahler. Humanizes a deep story. https://t.co/XSn0syrWRM
Missed the @AdamSchefter news break on Davante Adams. My error.
He can ask whatever he wants. Gettleman’s not exactly a contract pushover. https://t.co/YghFfmbCW1
No. The great news for AFC South teams would be to continue on the change-coaches-every-two-years treadmill. https://t.co/gTcrhsdsCM
Good scoop, @RapSheet. 14.5m/yr is a lot, but with Jordy’s decline, Adams is a good play. https://t.co/SXCBohwyQq
Great scoop, @NFLSTROUD. Excellent work. And smart move by the Bucs, whose trigger finger post-Gruden has been far too itchy. https://t.co/o2yZMjtm2s
And if I were John Dorsey, I absolutely would keep him. https://t.co/LtDaDKv9Ho

For those who have asked for a cleaner @themmqb read, try this experience on the Frank Gore story: https://t.co/OyNKJNErVz — Would love to hear your feedback after seeing this story.
Enlightening story by @kalynkahler. The truth about the NFL ratings slide. https://t.co/XSn0syrWRM
Ahhh, February in Montana. This was a fun one. Non-press-conference, real-talk Tom Brady. https://t.co/N45ivmiNRJ
Best preview of the NFL coaching situation I have seen. Thanks, @albertbreer. (Well, I suppose I am a bit prejudisced.) https://t.co/EiAQqYkwjk
Hey @Stephania_ESPN, this story was a privilege to write. Thank you. Much admiration for Frank Gore. https://t.co/gMhsZtrUyS
Ryan, thanks for being so frank. This is a podcast everyone should hear. https://t.co/G9LpYYBRMP

Good morning. My Wednesday mailbag is up, topped by one of the oddest stories of the year. https://t.co/8ba8epzSQw
My Wednesday mailbag is live: https://t.co/Uoq0XHkyOT https://t.co/8ba8epRtI4
Will have a couple of pieces @theMMQB tomorrow: 1 Mailbag, led by the truly odd Harrison story. 2 “What I’ve Learned,” on Frank Gore’s vastly underrated NFL career—which may end Sunday.
Wish this guy was in the NFL. https://t.co/MKDTFuTO5b
Historic event. https://t.co/RM8scCDdYF
I disagree. Riveron was enforcing a flawed rule to the letter of the law. I thought he made the right call last week. https://t.co/jyvXf5cpkY
Thanks. Appreciate you understanding that some weeks I’m not going to spend 28 hours on the column. https://t.co/Gow6eXZWCl
The rule is in place to correct an obviously wrong call. This call was not obviously wrong. Al erred, in my opinion. Blandino enforced a rule everyone hates, as Riveron did last week in Pittsburgh. No issue there. https://t.co/jLEnQqjVyu
Hey @Lisa_Olson1, glad to see you’re still getting the job done at the highest level. https://t.co/JfeOIGbMT5
He overreached to make a bad call that was against the spirit of the system. Pretty simple. https://t.co/GNlvq4cSWv
Roger Goodell needs to call Al Riveron into his office and tell him to stop playing God. https://t.co/lS6B6eaihQ
Convenient, and true. https://t.co/e1irEv2EIq
FYI re MVP being solely a QB award: Certainly QBs dominate. But a running back has won the MVP in 6 of the last 20 years.
My 1-2-3 in MVP race with a week to go is in MMQB. https://t.co/690j5cXRF6 https://t.co/NZ3OVypQPr

Good morning. MMQB is up. https://t.co/690j5cXRF6 Hey, only a day late. Thanks to @albertbreer for covering for me on Christmas.
My Monday-but-Tuesday column is live. https://t.co/690j5cXRF6 https://t.co/6quIijR3Wo
My thanks to @AlbertBreer for covering for me last night, with two young kids of his own. Now 70% done with MMQB (rare Tuesday edition). Trying to fathom what I’m seeing in these Eagles.
SAN FRANCISCO-So great to share a very Freddy Christmas with the family today. https://t.co/NiWg1Fp8fh
Good to see @SenJohnMcCain got some nice reading in on Christmas Day. https://t.co/sw7VPDxDhs

Merry Christmas everyone. On Christmas, @LarryFitzgerald writes a tribute to his friend, @SenJohnMcCain for @theMMQB. What a life he’s lived. Take time for this today. https://t.co/YPtdWNxVT7
Owe it all to the readers and experiencers. Thank you very much, Greg, for all the support. https://t.co/rWbQrAOSpX
BTW, @AlbertBreer will be writing for tomorrow. My MMQB column will run Tuesday morning this week because of the holiday.
Merry Christmas to all. Do not want to end Christmas Eve on a down note. Have a great evening and great holiday. Thanks for your support of @theMMQB in this, our fifth season.
Here’s how it gets overturned: The NFL has ruined instant replay through severe micromanagement. https://t.co/9MKPCGVKPh
Amen. https://t.co/JrPt7XuVFm
You’ve got different eyes than I do, Al Riveron. There was no indisputable visual evidence to overturn a very close call. https://t.co/Qr7Qc87o5v
Precisely. That was absurd. https://t.co/MMzOHpHhEf
Ridiculous micromanaging overturn in New England. Replay is out of control.
It took a village. My @SNFonNBC TV story on Deshaun Watson. https://t.co/zpbLd8S0hI

Tonight, between 7:30 and 8 ET, my holiday story on Deshaun Watson will air. It’s long. It’s a little emotional. You’ll see how he is a living, breathing example of “It takes a village.” https://t.co/r7bhy28SKZ

A little @theMMQB housekeeping: My MMQB column will drop on Tuesday this week. Watch for special Christmas Day stuff @themmqb Monday, and my column on Tuesday.
Writing about Frank Gore this evening. I don’t know him that well, but there are few players I have covered who I respect more.

True.  Pittsburgh started series winning 10 of 13. New England’s 11-3 vs Pitt in Brady/Belichick Era. https://t.co/W2i81PAfQU
This is the first time in NFL history that the New England-PIttsburgh rivalry has been led by the Patriots.         Wins NE    16 Pit     15 (Includes playoff games)

A couple years ago, I wrote the players need to police themselves; there’s only so much rules-makers can do. I was ridiculed. Maybe rightfully. But I still believe that.
Imagine being a parent with a child who loves football and want to play. You’re watching this game. You ask, “How can I let my child play anything other then flag? Ever?"
These officials are brutal.

Happy 34th, @AaronRodgers12.
You’re going to like Joey Bosa, reading this. https://t.co/UCS9uQRFW8
Great Tweet, Field. https://t.co/XtUKZ4qJ5X
I love that 4-yr deal with @TheWorldof_AJ by Howie Roseman, keeping a good 27-yr-old WR off a thin WR free-agency market in ’18.
So many interesting QB questions for 2018. This is the biggest. https://t.co/ifMg3KiSDB
Great job, @ConorOrr, in putting the Eli benching into historical perspective. Really smart. https://t.co/FBmdizdrWj

My mailbag column is up. https://t.co/L2PdUT9zm2 https://t.co/Nf0j0HPPHb
No benching of a franchise cornerstone will ever be easy. Would not matter how it was done. McAdoo ain’t Pat Riley. How’s he going to do it smoothly? https://t.co/gmKuC7NdmJ
Okay. I take it back. Let me parrot what everyone else is saying. Hang on. https://t.co/VPiTZoyAI0
It’s going to take me a while to get over this. https://t.co/qwywNxStUG
Only a guess, but Webb has spent 12 weeks running Scout Team. Zero snaps with regular offense in practice since Labor Day. https://t.co/yZDbYygLyy
Guess is Denver, but I have no idea. No one does. https://t.co/KYEaoY0osr
Eli’s one of the classiest people, never mind players, I have ever met. Whenever they replaced him, outrage would have ensued. But it’s coming sometime. https://t.co/kuBUuS2JLB
If he doesn’t start 3 or 4 games, I agree. If Geno Smith plays more than Webb, this is dumb. They need to see 4 starts from Webb. https://t.co/20flScMAvV
Man, I am hearing the vitriol about the Manning benching. I don’t get it. Giants are 2-9. See what’s behind him. Shouldn’t it be about the team, and about 2018?
The story has nothing to do with whether he is worthy of the Tennessee job, or what he did at Tampa or Rutgers. It’s about how he got fired because of innuendo. Not hard to figure. https://t.co/kAH7ouWJZP
That’s because it might not be a sendoff. The two guys who did this might be fired in five weeks. No one knows what new guys would do with Eli. https://t.co/Ydp5RxRSMB
No one knows. No one. Theories are good to have at times like this. But when you don’t know who will run or coach the team in ’18, hard to know who QB will be. https://t.co/JY2ksMSgyi
Writing for tomorrow.  1 Good idea, mostly, because playing Eli in last 5 is meaningless. 2 Geno is not the future, so Webb needs to play soon. 3 Nothing, I mean nothing, set in stone about future. Eli could still return in ’18. “Could." https://t.co/yGjDUfZtfP

The Chargers, 4 games out after 4 weeks, are 1 game out in the AFC West with 5 games left … and 0-11 Cleveland coming to town next week.

My good friend @EdwerderRFA is caught in the Twitter quicksand today. https://t.co/njXkAdoLMY

Verlander.
Excellent point. You’re probably right. https://t.co/3z1eQb1HMC
That is one of the really fun things about baseball. You can go down so many rabbit holes, some of which are legit.
If Verlander bunts Reddick over, would Reddick have gone to 3d on the grounder deep in the hole? And would he have scored on the sac fly?
You’re right. I’ll take my chances to keep Verlander on the hill. https://t.co/49Gr4Y0z6K
You bunt the runner to second, then have Springer up with runner on second and one out. https://t.co/DjeN1O7Gy5
My Lord. Hinch should not be taking Verlander out of this game.

Not to me. https://t.co/m9bpIi7STx

I get it, Geoff. I just don’t get leaving yourself bare with a 40-year-old quarterback, as incredibly durable as he’s been. https://t.co/H4A07fPVr2
They’re leaving themselves unprotected at QB w/a 40-yr-old QB, w/11 or 12 games to play to win a 6th Super Bowl.
Meh. You think, say, the 30th and 34th picks in the ’18 draft can get you into the top 5? https://t.co/pM04a3BXUY

Our @JennyVrentas on the pyrrhic victory for Roger Goodell over Ezekiel Elliott: https://t.co/6aLYty9rm6
Great trade for the Niners, I believe. They have to think they couldn’t have gotten a better QB prospect at top of 1st rd in ’18. I agree.
Garoppolo3 Could have likely had 3d-rd compensatory in ’19 at least for him, or a better pick in tag+trade next yr. 2 in ’18? Not worth it.
Garoppolo2: They have to pray Brady doesn’t get hurt behind suspect line for 8 reg-s games, and maybe 3 more in playoffs. Too big a risk.
Garoppolo1: I do not like this trade for New England. Pats have always made do w/less draft currency than other teams. And now ...
That is stunning and overwhelmingly unexpected. Patriotland. https://t.co/9WrBqgHb4o
Be interesting to see what is coming back from Seattle in Duane Brown deal. Houston would like a CB, I hear, or a pick. Or both.

NFL should suspend Lynch for that.
If the Raiders don’t win this game with those 2 gifts, they’ll never beat the Chiefs.
Horrendous call. Horrendous. Refs stole a turnover from the Chiefs.
Cooper put his hands on the DB’s back, extended them with a light shove (but a shove nonetheless) and the DB fell. It’s OPI. No question.

Pence2 So @VP took a taxpayer-funded airplane knowing he’d be walking out right after the anthem to protest. Swell use of our tax dollars.
Pence1 The @VP walkout was a setup job. Niners have had kneelers all along, including 30 last week. Of course they’d kneel today.

.@SeanPayton3: "The current policies … are flawed. I believe this in my heart: We as society owe it to our children. We have to be better."
.@SeanPayton2: "The current system is not working and the madness is when you go years and years and years (with the same policies)."
.@SeanPayton1: “Here we are as educated and smart and forward-thinking as we think we are and yet it’s broken and it’s obvious.”
I applaud @SeanPayton, who was awakened by the senseless murder of Will Smith, for speaking up on the mass shooting in Vegas. Enough.

Pats have allowed 33 or more in three of four games. Rams have scored 35 or more in three of four games.
Not unless I got a 1 for him. He looks too good, and is too cost-effective, through end of 2019 to deal him unless you get a very good pick. https://t.co/nxOo1jMMy7

I like the 10-second runoff rule. It is proper in the vast majority of usages. But the end of Lions game shows it needs to be tweaked.

5: Have a good night.
4: I just think we need to take a deep breath and not draw too many conclusions about the future of anything when emotions are hot.
3: But it’s a resilient country. In the sixties, many Americans despised Ali; 50 years later, presidents went to his funeral.
2: I’m sure many of those kept their word. But the game went on. And maybe this is different … maybe the anger will last longer.
1: I don’t know the future of anthem protests. I so recall covering the 1987 players’ strike. Many fans said, “I’m done with football.”

Draft mania! @AlbertBreer’s first big board of the season in his weekly college column. (To paraphrase Brandt, there will be quarterbacks.) https://t.co/48HPbek7iP
Our @albertbreer wants his fellow Buckeye to wise up. Good advice. https://t.co/7MvFz4rEfJ

Carr: “Our true fans are hurting like we are. The city of Oakland is hurting because we’re leaving. We’re hurting because we’re leaving."
Thought @derekcarrqb was surprisingly frank about the Raider situation in Oakland with me, in a conversation for my podcast this week. Said:

We’ll have the link to MMQB up in 10-15 minutes. Thanks so much for your support of me, of the column, and of our site.
We’ll begin the series later this week. We’re excited about it. Send your feedback our way at talkback@themmqb.com. And good night.
… in the Bay Area this weekend. HS football Fri at Kezar, youth football in Oakland Sat, Cal-Miss Sat night, Raiders today.
.@TheMMQB starts an 8-week series, “Football Across America” this week. Writers/video-ers will rotate on it. I took the first one ...
For those who will ask why I am a little light on other games this week besides Jets-Oak (which I attended), here’s the reason.
MMQB filed, finished, a little later than usual. But it will be polished well by ed @dombonvissuto and posted before most of you wake up.
Life moves on. https://t.co/Yl24qFM0Zh
That Zeke Elliott non-hustle play is awful. Just watching it now.
WARNING: I use the word “turnt” not once but twice in MMQB.
Jones5 Blank sounded adamant that Jones is on board with the committee. Said Blank: “I got it in writing the other day."
Jones4 Blank said he sent a communication to committee members today. Said there is no schism on the committee. “I know where they all are."
Jones3 Blank said Jones is an ad hoc, seventh member of the Compensation Committee+has had significant positive input in the discussions.
Jones2 Blank:“The speculation is incorrect. He is not impeding it. I got a note from him the other day. He’s comfortable with where we are."
Jones1 Atl owner Arthur Blank just told me he disputes ESPN report that Jerry Jones is the roadblock to a Roger Goodell contract extension.
Per @TheMMQB’s partnership with #NFLGamePass, take a minute to learn what I learned from studying Jags’ OL this week. https://t.co/rXHK5QcboP

It will be covered in MMQB. I think you’ll like my idea. https://t.co/gUxsVD4Akg
Thanks, Ben. All parts of life have been good. High school and HS sports are a blast. This chapter is dawning fun and rewarding too. https://t.co/djhWSemRhH
Tomorrow, Vinatieri plays his 177th game as a Colt (including playoffs). He played 177 for New England.
That’s one veteran dude.
Just realized: The day Adam Vinatieri debuted in the NFL (9-1-96), Ravens played their inaugural game + the Cleveland Browns didn’t exist.
Thank you. https://t.co/8uSE08fH6H

90% of property on the Keys has been damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Irma. Johnson’s 6-acre spot was not immune.

Carr pocket. Watson pocket+mobile. He’ll be okay. But obviously if he’s getting beat up back there O’Brien will have to re-think protection. https://t.co/Z3zjdz7Vvq
I don’t blame Bill O’Brien for starting Watson. Hook was too quick on Hoyer 2 yrs ago. But I don't think it is this year.
Good luck to Trent Dilfer and his Elite 11 series debut tonight on NFL Network, 10:30 ET. He’s passionate about it. https://t.co/jcbOgAqyUn

In his Morning Huddle (our new a.m. newsletter @theMMQB), @JacobFeldman4 asks why QB stunk in week one. https://t.co/HIVCdQIzkp
I bet Cleveland, the Jets and a few other teams wish they had this average quarterback for the next eight years. https://t.co/yLbUg5eXKI
Rick Spielman made a great trade 55 weeks ago. Even if they end up playing Bridgewater long-term, it’s a great trade. Had to salvage ’16. https://t.co/NM3HW94XKz
My point was, it’s possible to have opinions different things. I expect to be thrown into Twitter jail anytime I step outside the lines. https://t.co/AipkpDtfDZ
Not a decision the Vikings have to make now. So you don’t make it till you have to. Let’s see how Bridgewater feels down in December. https://t.co/K9cwAdsX8k
Saints’ D wouldn’t be on the field as much if the OL and the reconfigured offense could get some long drives going. https://t.co/LBZH8nHT70
It’s a beautiful place. I encourage everyone to visit and pay their respects. https://t.co/UqndbEXmqm
Sam Bradford is going to have a good and long career from here on out. He’ll be a valued QB for a while. https://t.co/GH6QsF0yUh
That’s a plausible argument. I like encouraging teams to go for 2. It makes the game a lot more fun. https://t.co/gsJQrCAR4X
America has a lot more serious issues than LGBT rights. Am I allowed to opine on that? https://t.co/cXSm28PWFz
So a play that is 92% percent sure is too risky. Okay. https://t.co/XzcwHewBRw
Gruden wants to re-install a meaningless play, it seems, because kickers have trouble making a 33-yard gimme.
https://t.co/nHUqblP08s
NEW YORK-Never forget. Walked by Freedom Tower today, saw people weeping. A great and somber memorial. https://t.co/hrzGNVAcIw
