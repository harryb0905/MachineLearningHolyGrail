@blainecapatch And I hear 7 isn’t coming out til next year!
@_Zeets @yoda Money isn’t everything
A character on #TheWalkingDead was just chewing gum and no one said “Hey where did you get GUM?” You’d think things like gum would be so rare as to be remarkable or fought over.
@t1ffanyc Haha no
@brendonwalsh I always call you my high ass friend Brendon
@StevieVanZandt Hey! Seriously trying not to seem like a huge kiss ass here, but your show is on right now and I could listen to you explain pop culture history all day.  Had to say it. Love you. #SiriuisXM21 #LSUG #undergroundgarage

@mattkirshen And let’s not forget Eric the Half a Bee
@mattkirshen Gregor Samsa woke one morning to discover that he had been transformed into a fucking bee
@mattkirshen “It was the best of times, it was the worst of - fuck! A bee!”
@mattkirshen It took a lot of courage to admit that. You’re a better man than I am.

Hey @StoneColdRoger! What do you think of the the trial? How’s it going with that? Any comment would be much appreciated 🙏
@bader_diedrich @henryrollins He has a great show on KCRW on Sunday nights. I always remembered it as him beating me up haha. I think it’s because we were all there watching the scene so closely because we all wanted to meet him. Oh well 🤷‍♂️🤓
That time when Oswald paid @HenryRollins $200 to beat him up on The Drew Carey Show (about 2:50 in) https://t.co/FTn3TkVdQG @bader_diedrich
And that, my friends, is showbiz in a nutshell https://t.co/NVJAOvhZre

How is something that’s in the Constitution considered “unconstitutional”? What are we? A bunch of fucking commies? https://t.co/sNFWzHME4l
@Mickey_McCauley My apologies to the great Russian Federation and it’s inhabitants. In a poor attempt at humor I characterized your entire society as “communist”, when in fact you are a Constitutional Republic with a fairly elected president who means the world no harm.

@afuzzie @brianstelter Immediately
@NickKuetemann Your last sentence is pretty much how everyone is. 😬
@brianstelter Thanks for watching! Spay or neuter your pets!
@brianstelter The wheel spin is the least reliable predictor of success in the showcase round.
@brianstelter Showcase Showdown is actually the wheel spin. The end is just called the Showcase Round, or, The Showcase. Very common mistake. And no biggie. Just sayin 😜
@NickKuetemann No one is ever completely “ungrateful”. A free thing is a free thing. Everyone is stoked just to be on the show.
@brianstelter THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME! Almost every show someone ignores their initial (right) response, goes with their friends in the audience, and then expresses regret for not trusting their gut in the first place
@brianstelter I would definitely spin again with anything less than 65
@brianstelter We have a big prize warehouse on the lot 😬
@brianstelter You apply the cost of the LA airfare to  your trip, wherever it’s from. We use LA as the starting point so there’s a standard.
@brendonwalsh All we did was watch TV all the time. You call that teaching?

AOC Graduated cum laude from BU w a degree in international relations and economics. And she’s the youngest women ever elected to Congress.

@KimiG74 I know! This guy must live in Footloose City. #ThoughtsAndPrayers dude.
This has to be the right-wing political backfire of the... the week. (Because the right-wing backfires come so fast and furious) All you did was make this person you disagree w on issues look fun and adorable. If this is your argument against her, you just lost. https://t.co/U75Ntx1KFv

All due respect to The Beach Boys re that last tweet btw. Pet Sounds is a masterpiece. But seriously tho about @kendricklamar  And all modern hip hop for that matter. Production values are unreal. Way past #ILikeHotButterOnMyBreakfasrToast too haha 😬
Turning a fellow rock n roll expert on to hip-hop. He knows jack shit about it. Told him to get a pair of headphones and listen to To Pimp a Butterfly. Kendrick Lamar. Makes Pet Sounds sound like it was done on an organ grinder. This dude needs his own planet I swear.

@pithywidow Yeah I’m pretty sure this is market forces in action as we speak.
@beer030 @TMZ All their street guys are actually pretty cool if you are
@DougStanhope 🤔 I think it’s because once it’s out there it becomes news. Like Michael Richards at the Laugh Factory. The only one who can be prosecuted, imo, is the person who first recorded it. And good luck w that.
Shout out to the @TMZ guy who let me off the hook outside of a BevMo! a couple hours ago. Happy New Year dude.
@cdb120 @yinzr @oilyfishhead @blainecapatch So... according to Wikipedia, Root Boy Slim was a DEKE at Yale w George W Bush. Bush eventually had him banned from the frat house.
@JumbleJeff HTSAKN NMA! OYU OTO!
@briandarby @ChadMosher Pay The Rent
No Jumble in today’s LA Times? @JumbleJeff
@cruiseshipcrew Good question! @PriceIsRight? 🤷‍♂️
@ChadMosher Also frustrating to watch
@oilyfishhead @blainecapatch Pop that Locker Room! Let’s really zoom!
@buzzerblog This is true. And may I add that this is frustrating all the way around? I mean, we DO want people to win.. Also, never wear a Plinko shirt if you wanna play Plinko 🤷‍♂️
If anyone asks you how 2018 went, just tell them “The cat’s on the roof”
@bennettronic True! It was very exciting!
@KBMcVay Yeah... or a decent kicker early on. Or or or...
@CharlesEsten Yep. That’s what it feels like.
Well shit  #Browns But on the bright side... #Steelers  On the other hand... #Ravens 🤷‍♂️🤔🤦‍♂️
@yoda Switch  Vikings to Steelers and then presto! Welcome to Cleveland!

Sigi was the greatest. Knowing him was a privilege. He meant so much to the #SoundersFC and the soccer community. Man all these words sound so empty right now. I’m really at a loss. Horrible horrible news https://t.co/zYhLvhc6xe
Omg. I can barely move right now. https://t.co/ovZckVZ1IG
@akamcbride It was a joke 🤷‍♂️ But, as with most jokes, a grain of truth in there. It’s not til mid-January that  I really start to get sick of it 😬
Me, yelling at the neighbors: TAKE YOUR F’ING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS DOWN ALREADY!!! WHAT’S TAKING YOU SO LOOOOOOONG?!
@WillBozarth @WhoseLiveAnyway We all usually sign autographs after show... don’t know how that venue is set up so no guarantees but hopefully!
@underscorematti Haha Merry Christmas! And no I don’t think so 🤷‍♂️
@xeni ❤️ you too!
@xeni #joinin !!!
@yoda @aprilolanoff Merry Christmas dude! ❤️
A couple of my BEST Christmases were spent w @TheBradSherwood in Vegas. No debauchery. We both wanted a non-Christmas because we were single and away from family. Just hanging and laughing our asses off. Bowling at the Orleans was a highlight 😜 #Joinin
@BigBus_34 Also been counting my blessings today. This time of year I always get introspective. What went right. What went wrong. How can next year be even better. What do I have to do to make that happen? Etc. I get quieter at Christmas, usually.
@BigBus_34 Spending it w my kid 😬
@BigBus_34 #JoinIn I am! And same to you!
What a great idea. True spirit of Christmas right here 👇🏻 https://t.co/hsOY1tklj4

@ngaio420 How you doin’ man? Holiday love to you! ❤️
@shadowking42 Works out to just over $15 per person (5 billion divided by 325 million)  I know that pro-wall people always say “it’s a drop in the bucket!” and they’re right. But it’s still a waste of money and an awful look. And just enough racist.
@DrSprankle @ngaio420 Have you ever read the book “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again”?
Or we could spend that $5 billion on something sensible. The $50 billion a year too for that matter. Or give it back to the taxpayers and we’ll spend it. https://t.co/hq4dXt0v1V

@CharlesEsten Sunsets are beautiful, man 😘
@ridgemax Haha I KNOW. Everyone in Cleveland knows. Please give us something to root for during playoff time. 😬🙏
@MarkAnthony813 Yes! Great end to the season. I have renewed faith. Might even buy some merch next year 😬 #Browns
Welp... only one thing eases the pain of the #Browns not making the playoffs, and that’s seeing the #Steelers knocked out of the playoffs. Go #Saints! #ColdComfort
@dustinpjones F’ing half points.
I have the #Eagles -2.5 Murder. 😭😭😭
@Oatmeal Since we’re talking nuts and bolts... sitting down to do the work when you’re not in the mood trains your mind to always be on the lookout for funny. Makes it easier to be funny spontaneously. Still gotta go to gym when you don’t feel like it, right?

@peakeman Record stores need less broad categories.
@cathgreg_cathy (6) and please don’t forget that I’m saying this to you with complete love and respect for your beliefs. Merry Christmas ❤️🙏
@cathgreg_cathy (5) and finally... go ahead and play a “Fuck Buddha” song. A genuine practicing Buddhist would barely care. “Tell me. If you buy a gift for someone and that person does not take it, to whom does the gift belong?”  So please go in peace. Believe what you want and I will too. (Cont
@cathgreg_cathy (4) and we’re also allowed to enjoy anti-Christmas songs. When I was a Christian I quit celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday because I discovered that it was’t even biblical. It’s a repurposed pagan holiday.  Don’t let a Christmas tree be a false idol. (Cont...)
@cathgreg_cathy (3) Millions of people (including me) get fed up at times during Christmas season. It’s shoved down our throats and if we choose not to put up decorations or not shop... we’re not against Christians. It’s just too much honestly. And we’re allowed to feel that way. (Cont...)
@cathgreg_cathy (2) Here’s a link to the lyrics. No mention of God or Jesus.  https://t.co/vtZwusJ3Hm (cont...)
@cathgreg_cathy (1) Hey! First, I love you and thanks for being a fan. Seriously. ❤️ But @EricIdle’s song is clearly anti-Christmas commercialization and NOT anti Christian. (“F Santa. F Mistletoe. etc”) Be a Christian and have a great life. Doesn’t bother me. (Cont...)

Walked into restaurant today... they were blaring “It’s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas” I say, loudly, to the greeter “A little early for Christmas music, isn’t it?” I even arched my eyebrow 😬

@historBilia I like Christmas too. But I  realize it’s a secular holiday and enjoy it as such.
@Dungleberry420 It is, actually. And a few hard core Christian sects won’t celebrate it. That’s why I have to laugh when Christians complain about people saying “Happy Holidays” instead of “Merry Christmas” I used to have a bit about it on my act but I’m too lazy to look it up on YouTube.
I agree w you too. He was being an asshole and trespassing. He was probably full of righteousness so he went for it 🤷‍♂️ But a church putting Santa before Christ at Christmas time? Tsk tsk. 😈 https://t.co/v8Hc1Q5Sdp
The guy who was arrested had a point. He was protesting outside a church. Christmas was originally a pagan holiday that was repurposed by the Romans. Jesus gave no instruction to celebrate a pagan holiday in his name w pagan trees and other pagan traditions. Just saying. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/x0ElC3fBq7

@petersagal It’s like someone has a gun to your head and if you get upset they say “Hey don’t get political about it!”
@LindsyMcCleery @TheEllenShow I’ve had dreams like that
@khat_nip Local dealer. After the show airs. I also think they have to pay tax and title but that’s not my department 😬
@Shawn_Admire Ding ding ding. That’s what they tell me.
@blainecapatch I’m not really Willy Nelson
@ngaio420 Been on a list since the day I was born, dog
Holy shit https://t.co/uE9Ni7NvYN
@KevinBankston @ngaio420 Dude. Someone’s gonna read that and you’re gonna end up on a list.
@stellajewel1068 I know! I’m an idiot. 🤓
@MUFColin Haha. I’m an idiot. 🤷‍♂️
This is like watching Adam Sandler and his rag-tag team of misfits he put together in prison play the Bears  #mondaynightfootball
@StevieVanZandt Too bad. When I’m the road a Marriott-class hotel is ideal. When road tripping in my car I always look for Hampton Inns or similar. I need great basics and nothing more for a one or two night stay. 🤓
... the fuck? https://t.co/qoT1Mz2QbN
@StIroningShirts @ameliaboone Yeah a while ago. Sorry I thought you meant today 😬
@Wayne_In_Akron Please don’t mock the many scientific achievements of Mr Election. Isn’t inventing the light bulb and writing the Declaration of Independence enough for you?
@CJJessop Hey @PriceIsRight - a fan has a question for you
@StIroningShirts @ameliaboone That wasn’t me
@brendonwalsh Yo. This is Daylight Savings. What the fuck is your problem man?
#TeachRock is an awesome project  https://t.co/TJDVhXfgkl https://t.co/JK8NLHl0ZP
Because Election didn’t sail over here and discover America. He only invented the lightbulb. https://t.co/xtombucwY6
@widtap Well since Shane lives at the end (Right? He recovers from his wound. Right?) I choose Shane. Although Old Yeller is only shot after getting rabies. So someone else well-meaning but diseased can be Old Yeller.
@mamapainterhard Leave them. I’m walking away to an uncertain but hopeful future while the credits roll.
@huttopian Car is me and my overwhelmed-by-political-theater-already psyche. Tree crash is metaphor for me not listening to their bullshit anymore. America can be all the cars passing by and not calling 911 because they figure someone else will. How’s that?

@pixelvision8 @TimelessP I WAS WONDERING THE SAME THING!
@H_Grove @clevelanddotcom If you could please tweet me link to page so I can have it taken down I’d appreciate it :) Sorry a faker bothered you. Good story to tell tho! 👍🏻
@H_Grove Not me. Where’s that from?
@sannewman Is it because Horace wrote such long poems?
@sannewman Why not just change it to “Virgil goes into a bar...”?  That’ll be five cents please
@AKinSoCal Hey @kellydollyrot 😜
My #FridayNightFreakout starts top of the hour! 3 hours of curated-by-me rock&amp;roll w hardly any interruptions. #SiriusXM21 #LSUG #undergroundgarage

@duncantrussell I love it when you get high and tweet ❤️
This band rocks  https://t.co/xKufSXoeEa @bifnaked https://t.co/cl7lKH2yax
@andrewsorg Lol. Still not over it tbh. If you believe in rating this sort of thing it might be #1 on my “worst loss” list. And I grew up with the #Browns (and the #Indians. And the #Cavs.) Lots of gut wrenching losses to choose from. #revengeisadishbestservedcold
@Frauenfelder He probably didn’t realize the cameras were rolling on his mic was on. Easy mistake to make 🤷‍♂️
@EricWynalda Hey man. So sorry about what happened. And glad you have such a positive attitude. I’d be surprised if you didn’t 🙏 Lots of love to you and your family ❤️
Need some rock &amp; roll to take your mind off the day? My #FridayNightFreakout starts in 42 minutes! #SiriusXM21 #LSUG #undergroundgarage
@MountainHawk26 @SpinDr Did I miss the Rapture?
@JumbleJeff Haha You know I LOVE the Jumble. But it’s a daily puzzle so I didn’t include it.  And the LA Times puts it in the Business section. #YouDon’tSay 😬🙏
When I saw this headline I legit thought it was another story about Jeff Sessions being asked to resign https://t.co/zmbNjsMfxW
@Blisscartoons Your New Yorker cartoons are great too 👍🏻
So... Bliss by Harry Bliss (@blisscartoons) is the best, most consistently funny comic in the paper. (I still read the paper.)  Also... Pearls Before Swine, Get Fuzzy, Bizarro, Dilbert. Shout out to Zits, Frazz, Blondie, La Cucaracha, and old Doonesbury and Peanuts reruns.
@BIGBUSINESS I think that was from way back when I was on Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? You know, back when I was a celebrity 😬
Not the ending we wanted. But still very proud of the #SoundersFC and how they fought to even get to the playoffs. Goodnight everybody.
@BertLafc @SoundersFC We’re all about value. #SoundersFC
@MAButz I’ve been grinding my teeth for the last 30 mins
YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! #SoundersFC
#SOUNDERS!!!!
Let’s Go #SOUNDERS!
@thehill Yeah this kind of shit doesn’t help anything.  Meanwhile, I think I owe myself an extra period of meditating today. And I owe it to myself to spread extra acts of kindness too. Not staying in this mood all day. Fuck that.  Love you all. ❤️🙏
@FrelighShelby Are you a bot?
@FrelighShelby Then why issue a doctored video? I honestly don’t think that Jim Acosta OR the intern did anything wrong. And they can pull anyone’s credentials. Why the obviously doctored video?
If this faked video clip is what the Trump administration will stoop to just to justify ousting a reporter they don’t like, wait until they need an excuse to start a war. It’ll be worse than the Gulf of Tonkin.
@differ3nt_br33d Yeah okay. Fine. But still no need for a faked video clip. Pull his credentials just because and live with it.
@PressSec Total, OBVIOUS horse shit. You think none of us saw the original UN-DOCTORED tape? WTF is this? This is what the American govt does now? This is the GOP now? No thanks. This country deserves WAY better than this.
From @latimes article re Dennis Hof, who won election despite dying a couple of weeks ago: “The deceased brothel owner who was elected to a state Assembly seat was one of the few bright spots for the Nevada Republican Party on Election Day... “ 😂
@PalmyraDelran Great Show last night on #LSUG #SiriusXM21 🤓
@t1ffanyc Good luck 🙏
All you have to do to #Vote today on #California is get your mail-in ballot POSTMARKED by the end of the day. No lines. No nothing. Easy-peasy 🤓 https://t.co/Sz6qXUr3As

@blainecapatch Go get a hamburger
@QueenBrimley He’s he was. Benjamin Franklin was our 17th President. He saved us from the Nazis.

@drozphallic @PriceIsRight I just had dinner w the wheel last week! We double date w Pat Sajak and his wheel.

Of course I’m “working” today. I might miss the first #Browns win since the earth was formed.
@tercarnes Then may I recommend the amazing, exciting sport of soccer. Especially the Seattle #Sounders, winners of 9 in a row.
I like that 4th and 1 call. Sends a message to the league that you’re not afraid to turn the ball over on downs. #Browns
@SoundersFC Oh yeah. Not to mention... 😜🙌🏻
@SoundersFC Unbelievable. And yet, believable 🤓🙏

@Todd530 Nervous habit at this point. That’s the pocket where I keep the cards that have the one bid prices on them. The flap is often askew after I put the card in or take it out. It’s a constant thing throughout a taping. Someone is always asking me to fix my pocket flap.
@blainecapatch Maybe she’s an alcoholic #thoughtsandprayers

@heathercampbell I have experience being hooked up to an EKG for having too much Retro Pie. Does that count?
@clevelanddotcom @ijustine Just think... the Stillers could be the first team the #Browns win against in a couple of years. How sweet would that be? 👍🏻😜💪🏻
@ijustine What? Can’t hear you? What? 😬🤓😜 #Browns
Well... the #Browns look better than last year at least. So there’s that. Looking forward to how they adjust in the 2nd half. So happy to see a genuinely competitive team again.

@SenJohnMcCain had a Silver Star, a Legion of Merit, 3 Bronze Stars and Purple Heart. Yet @realDonaldTrump didn’t think he was a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam and tortured for 5 years. And he NEVER took it back! Now he wants to offer “hearts and prayers” - Fuck You
@realDonaldTrump STFU. You think we’re ever going to forget how you mocked him for the 5+ years he spent being tortured as a POW? Fuck you and your phony sympathy. #bonespurs
RIP @SenJohnMcCain. A real American war hero. His service and sacrifice in Vietnam will never be forgotten.

@ThomsonAlec dead heat maybe. Ivana accused Trump of rape once. Interesting debate question tho don’t you think? https://t.co/Yo7I3cGlmU
@realDonaldTrump Hey did Hillary every accuse Bill of raping her like Ivana did with you? Again, asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump Pretty ballsy of you to bring up Bill Clinton’s cheating since you did it so much yourself. #You’reaGoodChristian
@realDonaldTrump Serious question: Who cheated on their wife more? You or Bill Clinton? (Or to you specifically, wives)  Asking for a friend
