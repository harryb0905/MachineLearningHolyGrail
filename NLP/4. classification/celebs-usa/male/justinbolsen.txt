Ever wonder how they manage heavy snowfall in St. Mortiz? https://t.co/Eiss9PwGu8
Felt good to work with the guys clearing the snow and ice from the push track this morning. After some rest and a meal Josh and I got back to work figuring out how to push quicker moving forward.
Since arriving home I've had two great workouts with Frankie Del Duca, a few pleasantly long meals chatting and taking a mental break before we fire it up again racing in North America.
I am so happy to be HOME! Set the date in two years World Championships returns to this beautiful town in upstate NY. Question is... who's coming? https://t.co/JPvwwi5oN3

Current time: 621 Flight departs at 630, as of now we are still on schedule, but we have no plane. Story of my life
Never Forget those who gave their lives for your freedom http://t.co/fQ25cgrb
In the last 4 months I haven't had one flight that wasn't delayed... At least I can eventually get where I'm going
@JohnJacksonGB What's jubilee? I turned on the tube and saw the Queen. Country wide party today?
“@justinkripps: pretty choked my friend, coach and former teammate Pierre Lueders will no longer be coaching the Canadian team” what the?!
well #SATX it's been fun, but now I have to go back to LP and train some more. Too bad #Spurs swept LA was hoping to see a game.
@clayyoung747 and I got killed on #NBAJams 2v2 online. Probably because I kept pressing the wrong buttons
#hallmark Funny Birthday card. Hope my mom isn't at something http://t.co/78oWpmGu
@Timhallgren man took 15 hours to get here
Awesome, sitting in the aiport listening to employees fight about their personal lives. Guy can't read menu at McD's /c wearing sunglasses
Awesome left Lake Placid at 4 to arrive in Albany and discover my flight won't depart until 9. Love traveling
@JohnJacksonGB not my main priority but yeah it is happening.
Dinner was badass http://t.co/8h1UBTtY
1 week into the off-season, full body soreness achieved. Not as weak as I though I would be. Anyone else training?
In case you were wondering 345 wake up, responded to some discussions and had a protein shake. Lift today, sore from running love it
Sauna session feels good to sweat. Also feels good being in a warm environment hope the weather here in Lake Placid warms up
@JohnJacksonGB good stuff Jacko, is Henry back or just training with you?
First official off-season workout complete. Notable things: ice bath is real cold, running didn't get any easier and the journey continues
Another early morning for me, this might be a trend from now on. At least I'm able to knock out some school work before the sun rises
“@USBSF: If you could name a sled, what would it be?”. Ditka @StevenHolcomb @stevenlangton
“@spurs: Game 2 tonight! http://t.co/Axn7xSvp”.  Go spurs Go
Another 3am wake up. How long will this continue? Headed back to Lake Placid to begin the off-season #bashbros #getbrolic08 makes its return
Coming to the realization that waking up before 6am is a better schedule than 5pm wake up 10am bed time.
@JohnnyQuinnUSA Hey, I'm proud of you. You going to start training soon or what? Planning on coming up at any point this summer?
@StevenHolcomb Time to get semi-serious.

@jeremyjware I'm not sure man is that the crazy show where you go through all the obstacles?
Drive from Albany to Lake Placid never gets old. Feel like I should be in a dune buggy for the last 35minutes. Roads are terrible
One pounder from Fudruckers no biggie. http://t.co/jtY8VWtg
@justinkripps @jesselumsden28 me and langton are .23 off your start record in Park City with Shauna sitting in... how does that feel?
