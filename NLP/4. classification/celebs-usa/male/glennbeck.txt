@nickmalark I didn’t say I was trying to find YOUR happy place.  But, perhaps, you should work on that yourself.
@Aussiekate1 Very, VERY early.  But you can’t see the beginnings of a smile on her face?   Sun, mountain, skiing.  Sounds happy to me.
@reddblossom It is my living room.   It isn’t great.   I make a mess.
@SonSheik Oops, I just got it.  No. But, I did have to take a break from my  Native American series because I didn’t want to bring any negative thoughts into that work.
@SonSheik I will have to look him up.
@cpproaudio Chris.  Thank you for being cool.  I am sure we disagree on a ton of things, but being able to see past th\ose th\ings and seeing people as ‘people’ again, is rare and almost heroic.   Sad isn’t it.   Keep it up.
@wmoretti1coxnet You\ are too kind.   Believe me there are many things I cannot do. I actually put painting in that category.  :).  But I enjoy it.
@sarabelluum Sure. Haven’t even started the back ground yet.
@Maureen11015929 It would look better if you had a few belts first I agree.  But I assume you are not speaking about the art however.   I am so sorry that you feel better by lashing out.   I hope some day we can both lessen the focus on politics and see people for more than their opinion on DC
@GalaxyofSloth It is funny how accurate those chalkboards were.  Caliphate, isis, rise of Nazis, destabilization of in Europe and our border. The rise of Russia meddling in our elections, tHe death of Obama care and the push for single payer and my favorite, the rise of socialists in the US.
@KPY1134 Really?   I need more time.  I paint for a couple of hours on the weekend and then usually very late at night after all are asleep and I can’t sleep.   I need more time and you TOO, need an extra O in your tweet.
@MarclovesAshlee @RenleeAsh How I wish I could play the piano.   If I could ask for a talent, it would be that.  Music speaks to me.   What a couple.   I wish Tania played piano, while I painted.   Love to see her art or hear you play.  Ranch no 3? Or anything Chopin.
@Ulfhednar357 Did you paint this?   If so,  it is very good.
@TL38227608 Yes,  I am trying to learn how to paint graphic, poster like art.  I love WPA national parks and ‘travel’ art from the 40’s.
@lrmortensen Believe me I won’t.   If you are one that is saying this thinking you are cruel here and want me to feel some pain.   Just know, it is comments like this that ensure that I never quit my day job.  If you were just being honest as a fan... believe me I know. It is a hobby.
@swissreason Michael, I am sure I have done plenty to piss you off.   If I hurt you personally in someway, I apologize.  My opinion on politics like yours is personal.   I don’t like the stance and attitude of many on the left, but am trying hard to look for things beyond politics. Best 2 U
@AbbyRoggenkamp Abby, really neither can I.  Most of my paintings, 99% I don’t like.   They never turn out what I wanted them to look like, but I have learned to let it go.   Enjoy it for the work and just keep painting.  Most of my paintings have 3-5 older paintings underneath.

Mine is just a personal journey.   I love Native American history and their art.  This vacation, I drove through the Navajo Nation and it has been on my mind.  @JW_Duvall so, in a way, @JimCarrey’s art is on politics of today, while mine looks to the past. https://t.co/JV7ilwSieo

@moytoy12 @navajotimes @23rdNNC @moytoy12 you are correct.  While I have helped in the past, I have moved on to other things and have not dedicated my life to this as many have.  But, it always interests me how both left/right/ black/white etc always treat those who want to help as never good enough.
@PartisanCannoli @navajotimes @23rdNNC I have brought tractor trailers full of food to the Navajo nation.   We don’t always talk about what we do.   But now you know. May I ask what you have done?   If nothing that is okay.  But if actually being more than a member of the mouth mob interests you, you should help.
I would love to find a way to do a early summer even here and 3d map one of these mountains and make them come alive to tell the Navajo story.  You can even see the animals and men in the outlines of these beautiful rock giants.   These pictures don’t do them justice. https://t.co/0jnIy07uIG

@Plaza_de_Toros @HillaryClinton Stop with your self imposed ignorance. I spoke out harshly for 3 hours yesterday about Trump’s horrible move on this. I believe if he doesn’t reverse himself he has given the Middle East to Turkey, who will kill the Kurds in mass genocide, Iran who will attack Israel and Russia.
@DouglasVaBeach @HillaryClinton But her hypocrisy is fresh as a daisy?   Don’t come into the kitchen @HillaryClinton if you can’t stand the heat.
@dmgrand514 @HillaryClinton No.  You see if you actually knew what I said or believed in I admitted my mistake on Iraq in 2006 and did everything I could to speak out then.  The secret is, we all make errors, but until we admit them and try to correct them, we remain part of the problem.
@Zach_Team @HillaryClinton I do. You don’t listen.   You must be cut from the same cloth as those around @HillaryClinton when I spoke out against GWB’s Iraq policy, or warned about a caliphate, the Arab Spring leading to the destabilization of Europe, the rise of fascists and communists, Russia and Iran.
3. I find it hard to swallow YOU lecturing Europe about ‘THEIR’ refugee problemdiscussing ‘destabilzation’, or empowering Russia/Iran. I don’t like ‘whataboutism’, but to quote Pres O. ‘I AIN’T LISTENING TO THOSE IN THE BACK OF THE BUS, AS IT WAS YOU THAT DROVE US IN THE DITCH
2. It was YOU that called for the toppling of Assad in Syria, YOU who then did nothing to save the Christians being Crucified by Isis, You who made sweetheart deals with Iran, You who gave the “reset button” to Russia. ....  more
1. @HillaryClinton you do recall that it was YOU that encouraged the Arab spring. YOU that laughed about Gaddafi being dragged in the street then YOU ran the same guns YOU supplied to Libyans, from Benghazi to ‘freedom fighters’ in Syria which turned out to be isis - more... https://t.co/VGZBjA2Tju

@GoBlueMontana I know he phrase and I am the poster child.   I do have 100 head, a ranch to graze and a farm in the valley.  With that said, cattle, land and a hat, don’t make a man a rancher.   The guy who runs it for me on the 48 weeks I am not here, doesn’t need a hat. ;)
@SnarkyLorax Pants, a sweater, a coat for the 25 degree weather and a scarf.   Oh, two days ago winter YELLED at me about no cowboy hat.  So, in the snow, I donned that. Just to get the other half to YELL.  It is so fun to see how people react to every little thing.

@MoisesPenaSr  what a great comment.   AR’s were designed as a ‘modern sporting rifle’ in the 1950’s. The pentagon ordered them for the battle field in the 1960’s.  I use mine for hunting and sport shooting.  What I think you mean is: THE 2nd Amendment is not for hunting. https://t.co/BTQY3Tksfi
You do realize that the ‘modern sporting rifle’ was built and sold in the 1950’s.  It wasn’t until the 1960’s that the military bought them for the battle field.  So, yes. Modern sporting rifle.  Just as the rifle replaced the cap and ball, which replaced the musket. https://t.co/vOUTHCdDv1

@aplusk Great - neither am I.  ALL gun related death and violence down dramatically since 1990.   If we want to male a difference we should join forces to help those in places like Chicago, where strict gun laws haven’t helped at all. How can we, together, stop the killing in Chicago?

@aplusk One last question.Can you cite the source of your stats on the Iraq war?According to the IBC from 2010-2017 the death count is over 160,000.  Perhaps you are referring to US soldiers? But I cannot seem to find that number easily.  The press really stopped tracking it around 2008.
@lizzybean3712 @aplusk The ‘mentally ill’ should not be able to own a gun.  It is all in definitions and enforcement. Most don’t even know that it was the NRA was the driving force behind background checks, NOT, the anti gun lobby.  Also, we DO NOT enforce many laws already on the books.
@aplusk 5. We keep hearing about school shootings when the truth is a kid is safer in school today than in 1990.  Unless MS13 is around.  They kill 4x’s as many people than mass ‘shooters’ and yet, google MS 13. You will mainly find stories that are anti trump. BTW: MS13 guns r illegal.
@aplusk 4.   Overdose deaths from opioids, including prescription opioids and heroin, have increased by more than five times since 1999. Overdoses involving opioids killed more than 42,000 people in 2016 alone.
@aplusk 2. Suicide was the 2nd leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10 - 34, and the 4th leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 -54.There were more than twice as many suicides (44,965) in the United States as there were homicides (19,362)
@aplusk 2.  You are also mixing stats.   Your stat also includes suicides and shootings in places like Chicago.  Why is it that no one seems to really care about the dead in Chicago?  Is it that it shows that gun bans don’t work? And those who are suicidal will find a way.
@aplusk 1.   Okay, let’s.  10 people a DAY die in the US in a pool.  75% of them are children.  We could eliminate ALMOST ALL pools. Very rich criminals may still get their hands on a indoor, inground, illegal pool. But at a lower rate Han illegal guns.
2 @aplusk - no disrespect Ashton, as you stated, Guns are not for hunting or simply to protect your home &amp; 4 those who say you can’t fight the us govt, see Afghanistan. + School gun violence is down by 33% since 1993. (DOJ|Pew|Pinker) gun homicides Down 49%, gun crime down 75%

@DCW00ds777444 Then stop pretending to be a journalist and become an advocate.   As a member of the press corps there is a set of standards.  You cannot just hijack.  How was the president to respond?  He answered and JA didn’t like the answer. Would you support fox doing this to Obama?
@sturgeon_slayer @Acosta No. Hijacking a press conference is a problem.  The president answered his ‘charges’.  JA wanted this fight.  Unfortunately, Sarah Sanders gave it to them.
@agent1220 No. Both to the same standard and they both failed.
@Claypleasoptin Thank you.  This was wrong as well.  He did not ‘assault’ the staffer.  Even though that is exactly what the left would claim if roles were reversed.   No need to stretch or make things up. Like I said, two kids. Both need a time out.

It will be a bigger spread in the end.  Maybe 6pts?  But compare the words under each candidate in this story to the American press saying that even though Bob Frank O’Rourke ‘lost, he is still a big winner.’  Congrats ⁦@tedcruz⁩  https://t.co/qE8dj5eq3B

@DonaldJTrumpJr @SharylAttkisson  for the same reason the press and left no longer talk about Doctor Ford. It was never about truth.They were both tools used to destroy POTUS. It backfired. Democrats have begun to fear the agenda of their own party as they should. https://t.co/PegJMdW58t

If my choice was vote for the republican in NY and lose to Andrew C OR vote for @LarrySharpe Sharpe and send a clear message to the establishment, I would vote for Sharpe in a heartbeat.  It would be a way to make my vote count and be meaningful. We must look for the big ideas. https://t.co/zY7GJLbKcU

3.  A defender of Rights, Reason and logical plan for the future.  Our problems are too big for the same old ideas. Socialism is a system that fails every time.  Canada is not a SOCIALIST country. What the DSA / antifa etc are looking for is not Sweden or Canada. Rather Cuba.
2.  One side has slipped so far into the abyss of statism, that is no longer recognizable as a defender of the Bill of Rights.   The other is a response to the first.  Look for those candidates tomorrow that are not a response to trump but rather ...
1.  Tomorrow night around this time America will begin to look to the vote counts and we will see the road ahead. Will it be free markets, free speech and the bill of Rights? Or more of the same which gets worse every election it seems.
@paulkrugman does it make you feel superior to paint the right as morons and yokels?. Dinesh is an academic whom I would love to see you debate.Thomas Sowell, Jonah Goldberg and even our youngest @benshapiro would run circles around you. Want to give it a whirl? https://t.co/D1ftzcGnYn

‘Everything” is not terrible. Read Steven Pinker. Things actually have never been better.  Perhaps you mean, our choices have rarely been so important.

@porksmithchop And when it came out that it wasn’t true, I corrected it. Do you have anything I got right?
@dolfanalog Dolf, this is an example of intellectual dishonesty. For those indeed seeking truth, they would admit that what I was saying was, “I did my work, but - now you need to do yours.” i have never asked for blind trust, and you should never give it to anyone.
Or as I have said for years, ‘do not take my or anyone else’s word for it: do your own homework.’I would love you to give me clear examples of where I have been wrong AND right.  If you cannot do both, you are not an honest broker.  Let’s use reason and begin an honest dialogue. https://t.co/2chaZUrGnW

4.  We must never forget what a blessing these drugs are and what a curse these can be and use them appropriately.   Can man rule himself?
3. As it is with everything in life. There is nothing inherently good or bad - it is what you do with it. The internet, even twitter is a good example - it is what we make of it. Even a rattle snake is a good pet - as long as you never forget it is a rattlesnake and not a puppy.
2. As someone that has woken up DURING SURGERY, it takes a heavy dose of medication to put me down and keep me out of pain, even fentanyl wasn’t powerful enough alone. I am thankful for these drugs, at the same time, I was never closer to death on them. Blessing &amp; a curse.
1.   This is 5 to 10 times more potent than Fentanyl.  Pot was always called the ‘gateway drug’ to heroin when I was a kid.  I smoke a lot of pot growing up and never wanted heroin. After surgery, I was hooked on Fentanyl - easy path to heroin. https://t.co/IGyCcHTD3w

4. Again, if you judge them, then you must judge your ‘progressive’ history.  If you think capitalism is evil, global warming must end today and are not forming an army and killing those who disagree, you are exactly like the founders. My fear is, many don’t value peace 2day.
3. The 3/5th’s clause was to WEAKEN the hold of the slave owners who wanted to count slaves as 1 whole person.  The Founders said ‘if you don’t count slaves as a human you cannot count them for ‘representation’. Thus REDUCING influence. The ‘progressive’ compromise was 3/5th.
2. Answer: because it would require you to kill half the population.  What makes you a ‘progressive’? You believe in moving the ‘ball’ down the field bit by bit instead of revolution.  The same in 1789. The constitution banned the sale of humans as step one. Cont.
1.  When you need to lie &amp; distort history to win, it explains why you also need to encourage violence.  This flips the truth of the 3/5th clause on its head. Let me ask progressives why you don’t enact Peter Singers proposals on Abortion?  Thread https://t.co/hhJ4jXxhQ0

How does he nation come together? A wrongly accused man spends 34 yrs, 9 mo and 15 days in prison. When he does get out he could turn his life to blame, vengeance and anger.  He does not.  I thought the Ford/Kavanaugh circus could use this podcast. https://t.co/vU5mQZ9JS2
@nytimes The Democrats ‘perhaps playing with fire” by ‘delegitimization of the court’?  Perhaps?  Would this be the extent of your warning if the Right was doing this?
@nytimes 1: if the Supreme Court keeps it’s power through public opinion why are you not now bring us together behind it? 2: should the people have accepted Jim Crow? 3: if you didn’t want a political court why your love for RGB? Constitutional rule not political.

1 Glen, I haven't listened to you for years but yesterday I saw your interview with Ben Shapiro from a week ago about your new book. It sounded great so I ordered it. Then I found your brand new interview with Cassie Jaye (who I have followed since the Red Pill came out).

@PennyRoo Not sure the vomit thing is a compliment but, I’ll take it.
@ArtsBlogKeeper1 Agree, but he has delivered a sworn statement under penalty of perjury.I do not feel 100% about judge, but I want a fair and just system of Due Process.Leaks from the DNC has destroyed Ford and Kavanaugh. Any leaks on the fbi report, should be found and sent to jail. Either side.
@TBoharic I agree.  However, is he a credible witness?  Addict, alcoholic and very unstable.  I know nothing about him.  If he has truly turned over a new leaf, he may be the most credible witness. He should be asked and clarified, but raw data and public performances add nothing.
@jo_conservative We stand.  We refuse to go over the cliff with the rest of humanity.  Due process, rule of law, the bill of rights.  We must continue to make this about facts, principles and reason. NEVER about personalities, teams, or ‘getting even’. Be the highest version of yourself.
@ConAlterEgo Not at all.  I believe Mark judge should testify.  He has given his statement to the fbi.   Raw data should be withheld from public scrutiny.   GPS/fusion is a perfect case in point. I want rapists to go to jail. But I also believe in due process.
@Atheist_Cowboy @Cassie_Jaye Rob, it is so much better to listen before you speak.  I think you would find the conversation not what you might expect.
@IVicere Not at all.  An upcoming podcast proves you are incorrect.
@paulrevolution_ @Cassie_Jaye Tom, it is so easy when your guest is as open, honest and really seeking truth as @Cassie_Jaye .   I truly hope she was as moved by our time together as I was.   I would love to have an on-going dialogue with her.  The best teachers are those who are eager to learn themselves.
@HeNeverQuits @Cassie_Jaye Amen!
@adaroell06 @Cassie_Jaye Yes Adam it was and will always be.  It would have been nice had you listened to this podcast before you decided to demonstrate your addiction to outrage.

I am so fortunate to be able to have these conversations with such honest and open seekers.   Listen and share with friends.  Neither Cassie or I are trying to ‘win’. Instead we both are trying to really hear and understand.  Episode 3 and this, EP 4 is a DO NOT MISS.

@KirstenPowers if you cannot see how 1/2 the country is feeling you need to take time to re-evaluate.I understand how 1/2 sees Ford.I get it.We do not hate women nor cheer rapists.We believe in due process and this entire proceeding was sick.both #FordKavanaugh R victims https://t.co/WtU2qHANwG
#cnn cannot seem to stop calling #Kavanagh belligerent, angry or hostile.  Put yourself in his shoes. This stopped being about a ‘job interview’ 11 days ago. This was about truth.  Notice history and the left, LOVED The righteous anger of ‘senator, have you no shame!’
#LindsayGraham has never been a favorite of mine, in fact quite the opposite, but he not only spoke every word I was feeling but I believe the words that 60% of Americans are feeling. Both Kav and Ford were victims of power hungry dis. Thank you Lindsay.
I watched the #KanavaughFord horror show w/ my kids. They didn’t understand the process and didn’t know who ‘won’.  That has bothered me all day. Won? Tonight, watching cable news act like ESPN, I’m sick. I don’t know who won. But it is clear who lost. All of us and our children.
Ford trusted the democrats who now say Fords friends leaked the information.  They betrayed and used her, all victims and the innocent for nothing but political gain. Shameful.  Americans are fair and just. Both Ford and Kavanaugh were used and destroyed.
2. Americans are fair and I believe they see the pain on both sides and w/o evidence will not want to choose. If the democrats cram this down, I believe Americans will rise up at the polls, as we don’t want this to happen to our sons, brothers, husbands fathers. DUE PROCESS.
1.  This may backfire on he democrats in a very real and powerful way.  Americans believe in fairness and justice. Ford was good, but changed no minds, Kavanaugh brought it to even at worst. Fair minded don’t feel comfortable deciding this fate...
So if you are a man, you can interupt, shout down and mock.  But the republicans had to fall over themselves in kindness.
@SenPatrickLeahy ‘I’ve been on this committee for 44 years.’   Perhaps that is the problem.
@POTUS @ChuckGrassley confirm Kavanaugh.  If you cannot, President TRUMP - PLEASE nominate @SenMikeLee . Yes. He WILL overturn RvsW. You thought Kavanaugh was too far, I suggest the gop shows the democrats their worst constitutional nightmare.
@cnn #Kavanaugh ‘looked unhinged’.  How would you react after 11 days of smears?Anyone who watched with cnn’s coveted ‘open mind’ would say, “two people who are believable. One is lying.”  Now the question is obvious, do we destroy someone’s life w/o ANY FACTS?
Facts and feelings.  #Kavanagh wins both today.
I don’t think I can handle listening to the press tear this man apart after hearing #Kavenaugh   What they say will set the country up to peace or conflict.   Will they ratchet things down or double down?  I fear for the future.
If you think #Kavanaugh is lying then he deserves an Emmy and an Oscar for best performance.His emotion for those who stood up for him is palpable.  Name the actor that could deliver this if it weren’t true. No one but the best actors could pull this off. He is telling the truth.
Shame on you. Have you no compassion?   What would you do if you were in his position? Or have you named yourself God and have full knowledge of who is telling the truth.  Shame on you! https://t.co/ZPlqBmGQ0H
Look at the pain on the faces of his wife and family.  #Kavanaugh is powerful.   If you ‘know’ who is telling the truth, you must be God.
This may be our Charles Sumner moment. #Kavanaugh if we cannot have compassion and see his pain and realize what wolves politicians have become, we will not come back together. The democrats betrayed Ford, Kavanaugh and most of all, our children. Wake Up!
I have not been full throated with Kavanaugh UNTIL NOW.  #ConfirmKavenaughNow  his emotion about his mother and father was real.   Does America have no shame?!
Kavanaugh is hitting it out of the park.  The left will not hear him but 60% will - if they are able to see this response.  This is a pivot point.  #KavanughHearings will be remembered as a key point in the death of our nation.
It is time once again for someone to ask:  ‘have you no shame!”  How can a country survive if this is our selection process.   ‘A national disgrace.’
If  you were #BrettKavanagh and you didn’t do what Ford said, how would you handle this?  It would be so hard not to be outraged.  No evidence, heresay and whatever happens 1/2 of the country will never look at you the same.
Come up for air Spartacus-
Does anyone else think the caffeine thing is bizarre?  Has she been on medication for her nerves? I would understand it, I would also understand not sleeping well leading up to this point. But she said, ‘my brain isn’t working so quickly right now’. #FordvsKavanaugh
Dear God, I cannot take #coreybooker talk about our ‘lives, fortunes and sacred honor’.  Sit down Spartacus.
The #FordHearing is NOT about truth, Justice 7 certainly not about you. This is ONLY about three people.  Can the press convince 3 senators that the backlash to them will be too great if they vote for Kavanaugh.We are watching the most expensive lobbying moment in history.
Why do the @CNN hosts keep asking about republicans who come to this #fordtestimony ‘with an open mind’, and not the same for democrats? Does an open mind indicate that you can only achieve this status by agreeing with Ford?
This is the OJ Trial Redux. #FordKavanaughHearing   When social justice is involved, peoples ‘feelings’ trump evidence. Half of the country and apparently EVERY VOICE on cnn believe her. The other half will not.  OJ jury had dna evidence they dismissed. Here it is only her word.
2.  How can ANY one defend themselves if we make it all about personality performance? ‘She is so credible’.  Is countered with ‘she is lying.’  He said/she said. No winners. We cannot destroy people on this level of evidence. Would you accept this standard for YOU?
1.   #FordKavanaugh observations so far.  #cnn keeps referring to her crying. Not once has she cried. She has seemed nervous or afraid. She has not provided any evidence beside her testimony. Mark Judge should be compelled to testify.  This process doesn’t work.
This is a search for truth &amp; justice? This is ridiculous.  Let the woman who does this for a living do her job then give the senators time to ask afterword.  This is a joke.  #ChristinaBlaseyFord
I see her fear and believe it.  I see her nervousness and believe it.  I am sorry but #ChristineBlaseyFord’s ‘pain’ doesn’t seem authentic. Others will see it as authentic. How are we to judge this without evidence?
5. We are seeing the McCarthy hearings, witch trials and mob justice all at once.If there is credible EVIDENCE then show it.  If not be careful not to set standards that you wouldn’t want to be judged with.Heresay is not evidence nor is he said she said, DAMN RIGHT ITS NOT FUNNY
@DeliliaOMalley @BrettKavanaugh Neither are mobs, lynchings and witch trials.
4. I and my daughters were traumatized by this that #wetoo had to come forward and tell the nation a story that may or may not have an ounce of truth to it and reassure the people that if you just condemn BK we will promise never do it to you.#trustUS #gulagsarespas
3. Anyway, BK (also directly connected to the BtK killer in an indirect way) was forcing these puppies and baby whales to have sex with these college girls. I have a ton of witnesses but I can’t name them at all, and the whales can’t talk, otherwise they would testify too.
Now, I only remembered this because when Donald trump was running I saw BK’s name on that judge list. Now I know you say his name wasn’t on that list, but that is like saying the NYTs removed a paragraph and then denied it was ever written....2
1.  I need to make this statement that I am pretty sure happened sometime between 1964 and 1987.  @BrettKavanaugh who may have been 7 yrs old, (possiblly 15)ran a chain of whore houses where he kept college age woman locked in hush puppy shoe boxes.
This is what I want to happen tomorrow at the Kavanaugh hearings. https://t.co/RE5f1W9Fdv

@Alyssa_Milano Should read ‘neither for nor against.’

@pajacobs @CRTV @ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Couldn’t have.  I proudly was never a member.
@WilliamReiser13 @CRTV @ericbolling Because the evidence showed that he was doing some great things.  Regulation, judges (upper/lower) ISRAEL, possibly even trade agreements IF this trade war is a tactic not A policy. He is no more popular&amp; no gain for me as you will always h8 me. Now, can you admit any flaws?
@CRTV @ericbolling 2. I have no problem clearly starting the truth, he was not my choice and I still struggle with him, at times.   But I would be disingenuous if I didn’t give him credit where credit is due. But to not notice the flaws and/or risks is also disingenuous.
@CRTV @ericbolling You are right, I did not vote for him. But he is Our president. In context ‘We’ is used as a way to reflect the American process.   Just as we elected Reagan and We elected Obama.  We the American people. Once the vote is counted, he becomes OUR president

Actually, just reread a couple of troubling paragraphs.  @harari_yuval is missing the difference between DJT, or Brexit ‘leaders’ and what people are actually feeling - also missing something deeply important regarding lessons of nation building. TR was wrong.
Just started @harari_yuval new book 21 Lessons for the 21 Century.  One chapter in and I think I agree with his look at the struggle of the last 100 yrs.   I think. I believe our differences may only be a @JonHaidt word illusion. But, I can’t wait o have him on soon
People think in terms of stories, not facts.The more simple the story, the easier for people to understand.LEFT: trump is a monster.   RIGHT: CNN is the problem.Both of those have some truth, but they hold sway over us, because they are also simple story lines.We need to grow up.
When we say: ‘people should think for themselves,’ do we actually mean, ‘people should think more like me?’  #AddictedToOutrage.

@D_Barbera @fred_guttenberg I was not reading into it. I was reading Fred’s tweet from 2 days ago.
@ernestoserrano @fred_guttenberg @famsvarpac No tragedy NONE gives you lifetime license to be free of challenge. I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child in ANY way let alone a shooting. &amp; as I said to Fred, I should have been more gentle in my 1st tweet. However, the ?’s I asked are fair &amp; deserve a civil conversation.
@fred_guttenberg Fred, I am truly disappointed.I have NEVER set a guest up. My bookers at CNN and Fox will confirm I ALWAYS keep my word with guests ALWAYS.americans want a fair, civil conversation (not debate) i tweeted ?’s in a thread earlier. I want reconciliation not a win.plz reconsider
@NateSilver538 Nate, the authors feelings, fears and conclusions were my nightmares in 16 and still r. But, if a group of officials thwarted Ocare because they thought it was economically dangerous, should anonymous and unelected be able to do this? Where is the line?constitutional crisis?
I have a lot of conflicting feelings about this.  ‘No one wanted to start a constitutional crisis’?You already have. On the other hand, I am glad that someone is doing this, yet, at the same time, you CANNOT do this.Anonymous &amp; unelected?!Stand in the open https://t.co/8oMvA7gNCO
@mikiebarb Michael as a daily podcast listener, I would love to hear you address - If trump is a danger:  1. Doesn’t he have a responsibility to tell us and not allow people to just claim he is a ‘nobody’ or fake news?  2. Doesn’t this make POTUS more paranoid? 3. Is this even lawful?
This is cowardice not patriotic. If the president is a danger to the nation, and you have evidence, you MUST come forward.1. you just have made POTUS more likely to go w/impulses. 2. You have not been elected. He was. 3. No job is worth ‘saving’ if the country &amp; oval is lost https://t.co/REKr1Rzo88

@fred_guttenberg Fred, I am sure you have read my thread response to you. For a civil conversation - I would invite you on to the program.  Let me know.
@LiberalPaul I am for tough enforcement laws.   Don’t put words in my mouth. Also, just because we disagree doesn’t mean I want children to die.   I believe there are things that aren’t being done on both sides but name calling stops reason.
@thelovemaster Sure did.   Could you please outline my ‘agenda’ or ‘those I support.’
@jessphoenix2018 of course I can Jess.  Pain, failure, loss, tragedy is the main motivator for most change, be it personal or invention.  Perhaps you should read my response to his and find some understanding. https://t.co/E5anWDHzWW
For those who want to know:  read ‘addicted to outrage.’  We are living in a ‘post Modern world’.  Until we, right and left, fully understand this, nothing will make sense and we will continue to call each other names and respond w/ outrage. #addictedtooutrage https://t.co/ucLaL1ZCe8
5.  FYI, this judge isn’t one I would pick, so I am not a blind defender, nor a guy who blindly defends Trump or GOP, but I was ashamed by the circus - he does not hate you, your child or children. You accomplished your stated goal.  I find it sad and dishonorable.
4. as a parent that has gone through hell, you I am sure can understand the mindset of a man under attack, so much so that his children needed to be removed from the venue.  Did you as a father not relate to the hatred and chaos of the day and feel compassion? Cont
3.  Fred, completely apart from my disagreement on gun control, or tragic loss for your child.  You tweeted that you were going to do something to insure he wouldn’t be confirmed, 2 days b4 the ‘handshake’. Were you an ‘honest broker?’  Cont
2.  Before we get to Kavanaugh - I am honestly trying to understand, why you haven’t banned together for a new Sheriff, school board etc.   While I disagree with gun control, it is your right to disagree, so yes, pursue that, but when will those locally be held Accountable?
1. Fred, truly I am sorry for your loss.  I cannot imagine what it is like to lose a child.  The pain must be crippling and never ending.   There is no daylight between us on this.  Please know that I believe you, that you would never choose this life or path.  Cont. https://t.co/d9BW2pGY4y
I will NOT apologize.   2 days before his ‘meeting’, he stated his goal of being there to make sure the nominee would be blocked for confirmation.   That is not an honest broker. This was a preplanned set up.
Do not play into the #additiontooutrage .  The media knew who he was and what his goal was and is. Nothing new and nothing to see other than a set up, using dead children, and post modern tactics that are beneath Venezuela. @fred_guttenberg @CNN @benshapiro @RubinReport https://t.co/AAkKjj43Pb

I fear I am going to be up all night.  I just started a new book How to Think: a survival guide for a world at odds by Alan Jacobs.  Powerful. Compelling and is already pushing me into action.  If the remaining 2/3rd is as good as the first 3rd, it’s a game changer.
Just finished The Coddling of the American mind by @glukianoff Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt.   Insightful. Straight forward and very helpful.  A book that not only correctly identifies what ails us but also gives practical steps to cure. MUST READ

@themitchellfink So, you believe you have the right to be the judge on who can speak and who cannot?  Sorry, but I believe we all have a right to speak, it is my country as well.  More voices not less.
@RSFNYR Having liberals or ‘conservatives’ on is part of the problem.  Having people who have a real desire to defuse the time bomb we are all sitting on, is key.  Listening and working toward peace and reconciliation.
@WrongGod2NoGod @chucktodd I know, so boring.Sure the republic cannot/will not exist with out the fourth ‘branch’, the press.  But why even try to do anything. Let the whole country slide into chaos and civil war.  You think this is boring. What until people are killing each other over nonsense. Mega yawn.
@mom_5girls @chucktodd I am being kind.  Actually the 9th ‘most trusted’ is CNN.  BBC is 1, FOX is Two, PBS/NPR is three.  Clearly lots of liberals in this poll, but to have FOX surrounded by those two over media giants speaks volumes.
@jwilburn63 @chucktodd I cannot program to those who do not listen nor those who insist on self imposed ignorance.DJT lied about some stuff and told the truth on others. He came through on some big policy issues, I like and admit that. He is also a twitter train wreck.can you admit that?
I take my share of the blame. But this took all of us on both sides. ‘Bush hates black people’/bush blew up the levies’ bush knew or was involved in 9/11am.  Sorry, but 49% of DEMOCRATS believed that by 2006  all authored by Alex Jones. I have admitted to my role years ago. You? https://t.co/6kvd1HfsI8
Just as 99% of those on the right outright reject the Nazis, you must do the same with revolutionaries.  We can argue about the siz of the welfare state, but not socialism.  Not an end to capitalism or our system of government/bill of rights. What do you have to lose @chucktodd
4 we may be able to move forward.  Perhaps not, as you will not get 40-50% of this country to abandon capitalism or the bill of rights.  So if you are indeed democratic socialists or really think antifa is good we will never come together....cont
3. To their satisfaction, then calmly try to explain how you see what they said from another point of view, and the person that went first, now has to listen and not defend. Yes, it will be hard for both sides, but once we HONESTLY, try to listen and learn ...
2. When will anyone in the MSM sit down with someone - who will take on their own side, and simply ask, why does 40% distrust us.  Don’t react just listen. Perception is reality when it comes to the news ‘product’.  Then when you can repeat back... cont
@chucktodd  how do people this smart continue to miss the point.  Fox may have been deemed a joke by 40% but cnn, msnbc/nbc, abc, cbs, NYThas been deemed the same by another 40%.  And you all continue to focus on those who agree with you instead of asking why...1 cont

Remember, #Brennan cleared The Muslim Brotherhood as a ‘largly secular organization.’   Sure, and Putin is largely a Mother Theresa figure.

So many condemn the Founders for not doing ‘enough’ to stop slavery.  Instead of arguing, ask them if they are an abolitionist today!  Help stop the slave trade w/isis and all around the world.  @Mercury1Charity and the Nazarene Fund is proud partner with @ourRescue https://t.co/L97zpHjXRM

I was speaking out about him when the left embraced his 9.11 truther nonsense. In 2006 51% of Democrats believed his theory was right. He was and is a poison.
No. Which is exactly my point. Both are h8ful and a danger, so, Why is one being rounded up and the other not.   I cannot understand how asking for consistency is not acceptable.

Sanctions, killing 100 Russian soldiers in Syria, telling Germany to drop the Russian pipeline, hurting Russian ally Iran, recognizing Israel. Yep. Trump is trying, but I doubt he will ever top, letting Russia take Crimea and dropping cash on an Iranian tarmac. https://t.co/DoCbZLAyPC

8. About a lynch mob.  I tweeted support for @JamesGunn just as I had for @MarkDuplass , @BenShapiro and @BretWeinstein - and as of 12am Sunday, I am now being accused of ‘insensitive’ at best, aiding a child molester or an actual child molester at worst. 9 cont

Calling for @JamesGunn ‘s head.  He was fired from Disney. @benshapiro did the honorable thing as expected and set the record straight saying this was wrong. He stood up for the man who had done what others were doing to him. But being fired wasn’t enough now... cont7

3. Some came to speak for both Mark and Ben - such as @BretWeinstein only 2B smeared as the mob on both sides had decided that a lynching must happen. Bloodlust - a thirst for total victory. One of the very vocal anti  Ben voices was @JamesGunn - who is very good at smearing foes
The called @benshapiro all kinds of awful names - like racist &amp; homophobe.  They took old tweets, some out of context, some from 10+ years ago that Ben had already addressed and apologized for. But, it was enough for @MarkDuplass  to retreat,,, cont 3
If @MarkDuplass is the man I think he is, a good guy who wants to unite people, I feel for him tonight.  Last week, he tried to open minds by suggesting people follow Ben Shapiro,  the Mob came for his head to frighten Mark into silence.. cont 1
@spkupnw @benshapiro @MarkDuplass I am sorry your honor, I have only seen awful &amp; outrageous tweets that were explained and apologized for years ago. I am sure you are not convicting him of being a child rapist without at least a ‘name protected’ victim. I didn’t even know he had been charged let alone convicted.
@HollyCabot @benshapiro @MarkDuplass You are half right.  Disney knew about these tweets which he explained and publically apologized for years ago. This is a result of targeting my good friend @benshapiro. He used old Ben tweets in hopes of burning Ben. It was turned on him. We must ALL stop playing w/matches.
@thaburga @benshapiro @MarkDuplass Spend just a couple of minutes reading my tweets before you join the mob. Notice I stood for @MarkDuplass @benshapiro and @JamesGunn.  How am I possibly singling out the left, when it was the right going agains Gunn? #THINKB4YOUTWEET
@SarahSaysWhoDey @benshapiro @MarkDuplass Let’s start here first.  Why do you know about this old tweet?
@Daemonbalehawk @benshapiro @MarkDuplass Time for what? The next outrage? Both sides R wrong. Those who see - MUST speak, no matter the cost, or it will get much worse. We are an angry and vindictive society and it doesn’t matter who started it.  WHO WILL STAND TO STOP IT? @MarkDuplass @RubinReport
My principles nor religion support public lynchings for speech.IF @JamesGunn IS a child molester,I too will want to see him in jail.Americans used to believe Innocent until proven guilty. How about we try innocent until actually accused or charged?#babysteps2justice https://t.co/1iiEh6X1ew
We all have more to lose than money, fame or position. I stand against mobacracy. It isn’t a ‘strange hill’.Twitter is not the voice of the people on either side. It is mob rule.i refuse to become that which I despise. Why now &amp;not 5yrs ago?Politics on both sides. #madness https://t.co/oRbmTSzKOA
@dejrabel @benshapiro @MarkDuplass I was torn. I said they should have never hired her. She is very destructive. The company has a right to do it, as with Gunn. But, I am concerned about L and R ‘mobs’. He was fired not for something he tweeted today like RB, but old tweets he apologized for yrs ago.
@narrator302 as some one who has literally raised $10’s of millions to stop child trafficking and deeply involved in rescues around the world, I do more than just tweet.This wasnt about @JamesGunn, but a mob response to @MarkDuplass ‘s mob attacking @benshapiro.#WeRBetterThanThis https://t.co/SdSgMq9k2K

@cmd51375 @JamesGunn Great.  I love this stance!  ‘I am not sure what it was, but off with his head’.   It was a number of very dark jokes, followed by an apology in 2012, years of not joking like that only to be fired because of a mob.  I know he started it, but why become that which we despise?
@realGaryCondit @JamesGunn No Gary, I was there.  I remember when the mob surrounded you before sept 11th.   I honestly don’t remember what my stance was back then regarding you.  But I do know,  I have learned a ton since then.  Isn’t that the point @JamesGunn is making? We can all change?
@balls_on_riders @JamesGunn Yep. Me too.  Fortunately, there are more people like me than you.  Mobs and bullies often show up.   We all saw them in grade school and some times god forbid, they grow up to be Stalin.  It only takes a few who are willing to stand and take the beating to change the world.
@Cull1776 @JamesGunn Nothing better than a good character smear to show you have officially become everything you despise,
@vnookava @JamesGunn If you mean standing up for justice only to have my head kicked in?  Yep, it is what I do apparently.   You should try it sometime.  It’s not fun, but it is what people who actually mean the words in the bill of rights do.

@BretWeinstein is one of the good guys.   I am sure we disagree on many things, but reason, science AND DOUBT are not among them.   Stop listening to the mobs on either side. Stretch, explore and surround yourself with people who don’t always KNOW they are right. @RubinReport https://t.co/Pe8XaLg5Z9
Was swayed by the mob this morning.  @benshapiro is none of the things that they called him. It takes great courage to do what @MarkDuplass did, to risk saying something that the mob won’t like.  It takes heroic courage to not back down. It takes time.. keep hope alive.
2. Just as he got for saying nice things about Ben Shapiro.   Ben is an Orthodox Jew, a conservative and a constitutional scholar. Because he believes in the bill of rights, he doesn’t shout others down, nor will force his belief on anyone. It is sad that @MarkDuplass .... 2
I believe @MarkDuplass to be an honest decent man who is actually searching for unity.  He has his belief as others have theirs but he knows by demonizing one another we will get nowhere.   I will get all kinds of opinions about me saying nice things about Mark ... 1 https://t.co/OQQ0d5LXNW

@shnarff 1st. Not my party. 2. I don’t call them an enemy of the people. 3. 2 wrongs don’t make a right 4. I have done all I can do. I cannot answer for others only what I have done and do. 5. It takes two to tango.  Put anger, justified or not aside and lead.
@USA_Supremo I see my job to call balls and strikes.  We may not always agree, but both sides engage in distortion.
A press that is not not licensed, jailed, fined or regulated out of business by government. Preferably, also unencumbered of special interest boycotts. A free press=any citizen w/courage to stand up to power and money to expose, document the truth &amp; varied perspectives. https://t.co/3DZqgU5s5b

5. People need to trust the press and the press actually needs to care about both halves of the country. We do not survive w/o a free press. The press doesn’t survive w/o the people.  What am I missing?  Do you really not hear the people or just not care?
4.  Why will no one in the media actually do this? Why will you not actually hold a private or public forum to really listen. (private would allow listening w/o having to defend)if you were married to a red state, the councilor would say you weren’t serious about healing.
3. First soul searching. Next admitting there are serious problems. Apologize, then try to be better. But 50% will not believe you u til the first two are done. This is basic human stuff, by not doing it it only confirms in people’s mind the media don’t care about 50%.
2. We cannot waste time on, who started it or who was worse etc. but it is the fact that there hasn’t been any true humble pie eaten by the press about not willing to take O on. People won’t listen because no one believes it is a search for truth. Cont
⁦@oliverdarcy⁩ - this is a great example of media missing it. This story from POTUS is mostly likely not true. One source and it is a cleric? Not good.i don’t want to compare, but O’s lies on Iran were profound. Why the different reporting? Con’t https://t.co/i5JgYgcG8q

By the way, GB Shaw, was the first to call for actual death panels ever 3 to 5 years. He was 1st to suggest that we should create some large room that could hold many ‘undesirables’ and use ‘some sort of gas’ to kill them. In 2016 he was still winning Nobel prizes.
Sure.  And yet, the Margret Sanger award still exists.  How about the George BERNARD Shaw prize?  When will those go?  Interesting how the left can overlook little things like genocide but not this.   One or the other, you can’t have both. https://t.co/KnT4feFM5b

@Abigail_in_1692 @BillOReilly @Ocasio2018 I understand.I really do. Millions are suffering &amp; w/our debt, corruption and hate, is relief in sight? Anger and rage are growing.

@RobertaSparks8 Trying to understand how Kipling’s Warning of Fabian socialism/progressivism, is me going off the deep end.   Does what you see on tv seem logical?
@TParty4America No, not at all.  Just sharing a warning of what happens when the world goes mad. Where people, like Chuck Schumer, claim trump is a dictator only to then tell him to change laws w/ a ‘flick of his pen.’this whole media/border thing is NOT about truth or kids.
This becomes more and more correct with each passing day. He wrote it as a warning to us and all future generations about Fabian socialism.   Or what in America we call progressivism.   Rudyard Kipling after the lies were exposed at the end of WW1
14.  And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!
13.  As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, And the burnt Fool's bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire;
12. And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more.
11.  Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four
10.  In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, By robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul; But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "If you don't work you die."
9.  And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "The Wages of Sin is Death."
8.  On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life (Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife) Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith,
7.  But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: "Stick to the Devil you know."
6. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace. They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
6. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace. They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease.
5. So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things
4With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch,They denied that the Moon was Stilton; they denied she was even Dutch;They denied that Wishes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings;
3. We moved as the Spirit listed.They never altered their pace,Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place,But they always caught up with our progress, and word would come That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome.
2. We were living in trees when they met us. They showed us each in turn That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind.
1/. AS I PASS through my incarnations in every age and race, I make my proper prostrations to the Gods of the Market Place. Peering through reverent fingers I watch them flourish and fall, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings, I notice, outlast them all.

We are so excited for next weekend.   The mercury special exhibit of historic artifacts.  “Rights and responsibilities” from mid evil iron masks to the original handwritten Gettysburg Address. From Franklin to Tesla to Musk. Join us, next weekend https://t.co/BM6qbFRINS https://t.co/AP5yshkM6x
@rmdomeni You are so right.  The death of ‘sense’.   We are about to re enter the world of ‘non-sense’.   That one was loaded with witches, demons and tyrants.   We need to find our way to truth, but we are running out of time.
This is terrifying: https://t.co/lwIQ4c6ZQw
It is and you pay for it the rest of your life. https://t.co/mTlH1kCQC3
And strong minded and strong willed people do this too. It is an illness, not a weakness. https://t.co/4Q1qo0oMrK
The death of #katespade is so terribly sad.  It makes no sense unless you have lived it, then you know that death seems “logical”. IT IS NOT. I know it seems like you are trapped, and you just want it to stop. It can. IT WILL. I KNOW.  Call for help right now. #lifeisworthit.
Americans demanded the scalp of Roseanne and got it, you can force bakers to bake cakes IF you don’t demean their faith while forcing them and Californians must have solar panels and only get 50 gals of water a day! But remember it’s in the name of freedom! @RubinReport
None are free if @scotus can tell us who we can or cannot marry or what parts of our faith we can live.  I don’t want a person of faith forced to design and sell a gay wedding cake NOR a gay baker forced to make a cake that says “traditional marriage only.”#toleratediversity
@NancyPelosi - Would you say the same thing if scotus decided the @NRA could force the quakers to sell guns? Your head may explode!Who do you hate more, the religious or NRA?Get out of peoples marriage, out their church and out of our lives! #toleratediversity #rightofconscience https://t.co/Bz3gyFV2UB
@SethMacFarlane - Seth, I believed in GM long before Clinton or Obama. It is clear constitutionally: Govt has NO place in marriage. But, there is NO ‘freedom FROM religion right’, just as there is no right from Gay, Black, white or stupid. #toleratediversity #libertariansRright https://t.co/dHtz6PVemk
Can we please STOP with the outrage over the headline about todays #SCOTUS “narrow decision”.  Perhaps those on tv are too brain dead to understand but that phrase here means “narrow in scope” not in ‘voting margin.’ Unfortunately, it is almost meaningless it is so narrow.
@benshapiro Yes, but too soon to be exciting.   They should have waited until Christmas.  But it is good to see that DM has healed so nicely.
@AP4Liberty Austin it was! Narrow in scope, not voting margin.
Just saw the advance of ‘the Soviet story’.  The truth about communism. Always first it’s about the workers, stopping the oppression of the hierarchy and bringing true equality. Soon on @theblaze tv. Show your OLDER children this vivid truth. Tv14 + (disturbing film evidence)
@EoinDempsey1 Great book!  Almost opened it to read a second time just the other day.  One of those stories filled with characters that become a part of you long after you close the book.

12. @iamsambee con’t: ..I will be torn apart by your fans and mine for writing this to you.  I have nothing to gain, but we ALL have everything to lose. Neither side can do this alone.we need to stop tearing each other apart, it will only lead to more hate https://t.co/h3AIdJXqx4

8. @iamsambee con’t. I warned you and begged you NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES I MADE.  You told me you understood.  I have prayed for you and remained silent hoping the kind woman I met that day, would find her way, knowing how easily it is to get lost... https://t.co/h3AIdJXqx4
7. @iamsambee cont: but not like this. When we met, you told me how many like you thought I was a monster for the things that I said. I told you, I was wrong and truly sorry, but ‘I was certain that I was right’ and that lead me down the wrong roads... https://t.co/h3AIdJXqx4

1.   iamsambee - I am saddened that this is where you have ended up.   I know you feel passionately about this issue as do I am millions of other Americans.   We disagree on much I am sure, but I was there on the border when those pics were taken under O.. https://t.co/h3AIdJXqx4
Damon, I agree that Van Jones should comment and that abc has not learned anything from this episode.  Also, let’s not forget that before fox, ABC signed a deal with me but because of my show on Islam at CNN, abc did all they could to keep me off air. https://t.co/dyigYKtBmU
@Michael53674578 @VanJones68 @CNN No mike,  I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of press.  She has a right to her opinion and I will defend her right to speak. But from ‘behead all bankers’, pizza gate is real, long after proven false, and now this, there are consequences of speech in the public space.
Perhaps today is a good day to remind most of all of us on Twitter to #shutup #Rosanne #abc
I never thought this would happen but ... I agree with @VanJones68 .  Maybe there is hope. Please do not, however confuse her with a conservative, she is a radical socialist who gives even socialists a bad name. #Roseanne @CNN  van, the free fall has been A LOT longer than 3yrs. https://t.co/M6JYS0C2bi
This is nothing new for #Rosanne. She just hit the wrong power person with the wrong slur.   She has been unhinged and has spewed ugly things for a long time.   #rosannedont letthedoorhityourfatassonthewayout. Would be the wrong hashtag to use here don’t ya think? #itsabouttime https://t.co/LuFWz4kWDS
Wait? #RosanneBarr said something racist? @abc fired her?  I am shocked on both accounts.  She could say and do anything if she was on the right team. Funny thing is, she is a socialist who has now only smeared conservatives. https://t.co/3EKL689Ffc
#RoseanneBarr is a socialist who seriously advocated for the execution of bankers in 2009. She is no better than #Farrakhan.Both ‘support’ trump only to burn the system down. Americans should see who both of these people are.@JoeNBC @benshapiro  @abc https://t.co/5jehEVBjTj

While U @ppfa makes your utopian world through masterbation, I will work to help build a world that protects all rights of all people, including your right to hold masterbation parties. Just not to kill. Oh, remind me not to shake hands if we meet. https://t.co/yQKEDVm1VY
This is huge.  @RealCandaceO is correct. And it is the principle of what caused all of our damage in the Middle East.  It never leads to peace.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

1/2 @Zigmanfreud come on John. You don’t have to agree with trump or even like what he says or does, but you are smoking something if you don’t think that a direct answer to a direct question about MS13 isn’t clearly about MS13. #MS13AreAnimals https://t.co/OEgv77yBTO
@Zigmanfreud @cluckman325 @theblaze @realDonaldTrump 4.  The people chose him. He is here.  They baked in porn stars and lies. Nothing will change that. I despise that. But to smear him with ‘animals’ was a breaking point. They knew it was a lie, deleted then defended. They have become everything they fight.
@Zigmanfreud @cluckman325 @theblaze @realDonaldTrump 3. Does that make him the greatest?nope. But I am so tired of the press siding with Iran /hamas and ‘divine spark’ talk w/MS13 because of him.   We must be able to recognize both good and bad.  Everything the press is doing is driving ppl into his arms.
@Zigmanfreud @cluckman325 @theblaze @realDonaldTrump 2. His accomplishments on ISRAEL alone is remarkable. Iran may be destabilized by his actions as uprisings have now begun. NK is at the table. Movement is not a lasting good but let’s recognize they have moved. ISIS has been destroyed (for now).and ppl have real $ in pocket.
@Zigmanfreud @cluckman325 @theblaze @realDonaldTrump Nothing to process.   This monologue is about the mainstream media and their psychotic hatred of DJT. There are two main things we must consider. 1. His actual accomplishments. 2. His personal flaws. The latter w/o question is inexcusable. How about 1?

@storymtn @washingtonpost Over 30% of bsa membership was LDS.

Your ignorance of who we are and what we have said about police brutality is stunning.  I take it on a case by case basis.  There are dirt bag police as their are dirt bag citizens.  I don’t know enough about Kanye to defend or not. I am consistent on #freethought.  You? https://t.co/B6OY8CKqV0

DCCC LEAKED MEMO:   "if we don’t promote gun control when people are emotional, it will never happen." What is The GOP’s plan?It used to be constitutional PRINCIPLES and rule of law. Today: No 2nd amendment,  no right of property or due process? Still on the #TrumpTrain ?
Due process IS slow.  It was meant to be to stop irrational, emotional and unconstitutional acts.  And we worried about Obama taking guns.Democrats are now openly saying we can ‘start’ with the Assault rifles and the GOP president openly says HE wants to ‘take them’! https://t.co/R4BszH3OZ9

@Deetweetstv @SergioGor @DavidIRamadan @BetteMidler No I don’t.  I am disgusted by it and have spoken out about it for 2 years now at a great personal cost.  I have demanded a principled stance from myself before others.  The right has excused the inexcusable — now will you say the same about your side?
Great point Beth..  I spoke out against that at great personal cost.  I was clear and condemning of it in much more than a tweet or hashtag.  I called it more than shameful.   So, How about you now doing the same here? https://t.co/ozUadbR3sC

@CNN @jaketapper @jaketapper I am sorry, Maybe we should get Jonathan Haidt involved as I believe this is the main issue.  We fail to actually hear each other.  Many felt like second class citizens under O at times, as if our POV made no difference.many feel that now on L. Both r wrong.
@cnn is at it off the bat.  @jaketapper did you feel this way about how polarizing the Obama speeches felt to half of America?  This president gave more opportunity to work together at HIS own peril just tonight, than O did in 8 years.
#sotu #donaldjtrump #potus  I am not sure what the North Korean or Russian judge will give him.  But this American judge gives him a 9.0.  The author gets a 10.0 a perfect score.   Very strong.
#sotu ‘total resolve’.   This section on North Korea is powerful and FRIGHTENING.   Why does this feel like a pathway to war?    So evil.  So dangerous.
#potus #sotu OBAMA must be pissed!   Wow.  G Bay double down and revised rules of engagement.   Perhaps he is on the bar stool next to Steve Bannon with a half empty bottle of Zima muttering, ‘what the hell happened to all my executive orders?  They could have been laws’.
#sotu   I would give my left arm to deliver this speech for DJT tonight.   So well written ... can I be a pinch hitter?  POTUS can run the bases and get the glory.   This speech deserves the Reagan delivery.
#potus #sotu #opioidcrisis - please - PLEASE - no war on opioids!   It isn’t just the drug dealers, but also over prescribing and then no assistance for people who want to get off.   I have seen how these drugs enslave and kill first hand. #compassion&amp;empower
#sotu how are the democrats not loving this immigration reform stuff?  4x’s as many dreamers WITH PATH TO CITIZENSHIP!!!  Frauds!   The first pillar is A Path not a wall.  Wow.   If all could get done, no one in DC will be happy. But most Americans will be.
@realDonaldTrump is killing it. Somewhere Steve Bannon is alone wearing two shirts with half a bottle of whiskey muttering to himself, ‘I used to be somebody.’  Don’t worry Steve, I am sure the Nazi clubs still love you. #sotus #donaldjtrump

#sotu #DonaldTrump is hitting this out of the park.  His invitation to the Democrats to stand for low drug prices was worth the price of admission alone.
#sotu laundry list of what has happened this year is off the charts!  This is the best speech he has given ever.  So well written.
Notice he doesn’t lean, look or even notice anything on his right.  For those on the left, this is what the other half felt like every #sotu  between 08-16.The first 20 minutes has been a delicious and well written declaration of what the right has waited to hear. #iloveTHIStrump
It is a night of conflict.  When POTUS is good and presidential like this , he isn’t as fun to watch.   Conflicted.  Not happy when he is tweeting and not happy when he is presidential.  Biggest conflict, Nancy Pelosi looks so unhappy tonight, it makes me happy.#sotu
#SOTUS nice opening accomplishments.  But does anyone else wonder if he is intending to squint like Clint Eastwood?
Why are the black congressmen Refusing to applaud the ‘lowest unemployment rate for AAmericans?” #sotus

@CRod_Carol No, they both have.  The next president may be much worse.   We must begin to come together and live the principles of the bill of rights or one side will end up killing the other.

@SteveSkojec So, Haitians are out, but Norwegians are okay? Let judge people by ‘the content of character. ‘ Let’s remember, many of our forebears came from the “#ShitholeCountries” of their day. Hard work and character is not as elusive in SHC’s as it seems to be here with many.
What is wrong with you?! He was specifically talking about THE PEOPLE. “Why do we have to take all these PEOPLE from these #shitholecountries’. ‘ Why  do we have to take all these Jews from Nazi germany?  That would be about Jews.  Not Germany.  Stop defending the indefensible
@Irishispanicdad He said “people”.
@Bisquettet @benshapiro Or perhaps I am correct and won’t sell out my principles.If Obama would have said that the right would have gone mad. Rightfully so. It doesn’t take a ‘really stable genius’ to be cool with policies but abhorred by his childish, juvenile and boorish behavior.#ShitholeCountries
Do not try to defend #shitholecountries to me.   I have been to Haiti.  My charity is currently on the ground doing work there tonight.  If you go there and that is all you see in the people you are blind.   I see people trapped, by a corrupt government which the US has enabled
@hkpowell1 Sorry, I just saw it.  Omg.
Really?!  #shitholecountries?    Come on.   Stop shooting yourself. This week POTUS supporters have had to defend him on:  ‘very stable genius”, ‘even if I disagree I will sign it”, ‘yes, a clean daca first’, and now SHIT HOLE COUNTRIES?  Please potus STOP speaking.
At work late tonight working on tomorrow’s radio show.   #FISA702 Bill is on the top of my mind!  Outrageous.   DOES ANY ONE CARE ABOUT THE BILL OF RIGHTS?!  Left&amp;right should agree, NO SECRET EVIDENCE/GATHERING ON US CITIZENS! @RandPaul and @BillOReilly will join me. https://t.co/GZdUG8a9XE

On my third book in the Singularity series by William Hertling.  The BEST novel(s) I have read so far on the solutions and problems with AI.  Very balanced - both utopian and dystopian at the same time.   Must read for those who want to understand what the next 10-20yrs hold.

@cmanock1 @benshapiro Agree.   But this is a problem on both sides.   Now, just much more pronounced on the right.
@petefrt No crow for me.  I have warned against Bannon and almost everyone that associates with him for years.  He is still a symptom of the problem.   Albeit a bad symptom.  What is our actual problem?  It is way beyond politics.
@BrownTieDan I am and have been.Just because you don’t listen or watch, please don’t assume.I have been almost alone on the right standing against trump since he announced.  I have and continue to pay a high price.   I do talk about Non political solutions everyday as our symptom is politics.
@suep398 @jaketapper Who said that?
@al5252 I have warned against him and the White House since long before they were all in the White House.    You are right, some don’t like him because he now is against trump.    He has always been a danger to the country and world.   And he isn’t the only one.
@Poohbear98188 I think your right.  Now, who has the credibility to build the case with facts that 70% of the country will accept?  We must restore truth.   Investigate all of them and let the chips fall where they may.
@mrsblack777 Who said it was a lie?
@KGoldPhysics This shows that you haven’t taken the time to see what I have been saying for the last two years.   You most like;y don’t even know that trump has Put me on his enemies list since the day he announced.

I have spent two weeks in the mountains, working on my next book (working title #addictedtohate).After 10 years of soul searching, study and finally listening to people over pundits, I see a way toward saving ourselves &amp; civilization. It is an answer to my 2008 book Common Sense.
Books I am reading this week: On book three of the Singularity Series by William Hertling.  REALLY GREAT.  Book one has a lot of set up, book two and three are non stop. Our Final Invention by James Barrat. Powerful And just started 1177:the year civilization collapsed.
#IranProtesters speak out against tyranny and for freedom while Oregonians can’t seem to cope with pumping their own gas.   Meanwhile in the world of politics, I am not sure if we are supposed to regain our principles and call out #Bannon for who he has always been or not.
