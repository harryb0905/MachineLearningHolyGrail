Thats not a rule. Thats why people fight 2 find out. “@tannguyen2013: @UrijahFaber Nope, the challenger needs to win the round decisively !”
I believe every1 is a champ until proven wrong. Like a Court of Law “@tannguyen2013: UF if it's close champ gets the benefit of the doubt”
.@F2WMMA i think we need extensive testing &amp; experience 4 Judges. Yrs of documented training.  Know how 2 score a wrest/bjj/box/kb match.
I had it 4-1 JH w a decisive round 2 to JH, 3rd round to GSP. All the other rounds where really close, edge JH. Damage JH /compu-strikes GSP
Still think Johnny won, was a close one. Just sucks that judging isn't perfect, but humans aren't perfect.

@DonnieReillyMMA keep the system in place, just highly recommended.
@DonnieReillyMMA instead of getting blind sided.
@DonnieReillyMMA that happens cuz peeps assume other folks aren't dumb &amp;  follow rules. New system makes peeps realize morons are abundant.
@DonnieReillyMMA we already r exposed 2 "judgement calls" this will just make every1 more cautious &amp; aware. Not just faith in the system.
@Scott_Cohn_Art And over a long period people who can't follow the suggestions &amp; have bad judgement will slowly die off, along w their genes
@Scott_Cohn_Art People would still follow traffic suggestions, just use judgement when a Red light is unnecessary or a green light is danger
Lights will b Guidelines 4 likeliness 2 die: Red Light=u might die, Green light=ur pretty safe. No waiting when its obviously safe, but Red.
When I'm Pres, traffic lights will b a judgement call, not a law. To help save time, &amp; help evolution 4 Human race #survivalofthefittest
