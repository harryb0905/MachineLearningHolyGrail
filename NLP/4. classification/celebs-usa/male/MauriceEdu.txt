Who was your man of the match today?? Some top performances today
Thoughts on Lovrens performance tonight?
Wouldn’t mind another 20-30 mins of this game though! 🙋🏾‍♂️@ManCity vs @LFC
What a game! The possession by Liverpool. The counter by city. The save by Alisson! 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️
And just like that...1-1!!
Love the way City’s attack minded players (Sane, B. Silva, Aguero, Sterling) have been tracking back and being a nuisance defensively.
Love this! #Terps https://t.co/FDcKBkzCdq
Thank you 2018 for the lessons learned through my share of Ws and Ls! Excited to keep growing, building and making strides with new adventures in 2019! Let’s get it! Happy New Year… https://t.co/DW5V9WDWXs

Crazy the impact a manager can have on a player’s game. Rashford and Pogba both look confident and free! Pogba 2- Bournemouth 0!

@scottLittle Not playing favorites. Stepped..stomped...it was deliberate with intent to injure. How Neymar reacts to being stepped on is up to him. Sorry, I don’t see the reasoning behind punishing him for reacting to being STEPPED on. 🤷🏾‍♂️ how would you react?

@fidelmorales4 So if I’m just looking at numbers and don’t watch games, I’d agree yea he has a better goal/game ratio...but I do watch. For me, consistency throughout the season helps to justify my ranking.
@AJD_20 Haha miss you too bro!
@AJD_20 Agree he’s had a breakthrough season and deserves all the praise in the world. Does that mean you take away from the fact that someone else’s “norm” is better? 🤔
