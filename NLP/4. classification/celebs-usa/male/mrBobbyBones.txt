@EmmaWhiteMusic I saw the girl taking shots earlier In her timeline. and for some reason she blocked me. so 🤷🏻‍♂️
@EmmaWhiteMusic @women_want_more what she doesn't understand is the whole reason I created the female show is to hopefully get them more spins, move them up the chart, so real radio programmers couldn't use the excuse of "they arent high enough on the chart". Im not a programmer. I create shows.
Lori McKenna is coming to do a #BobbyCast next week. Cant wait. One of the worlds favorite songwriters!

@ScottyMac05 Actually that’s not accurate. It was Originally names after Winnipeg. The city . And it was a girl
when Winnie the pooh was created, it was a girl. Its since been changed back and forth,   "Colebourn was a vet and and travelled to England to help care for horses during the First World War. He brought Winnie with him and she became a favourite with the troops.:
when I just read that a "2,000 pound bull escaped vet clinic to avoid circumcision" ... I felt that.
