Who says the NFL “Helmet Rule” not working. Kazee was flagged in preseason for hit on Marquise Lee of Jacksonville for leading with crown of his helmet. Tonight he had a perfectly clean hit without the head involved leading to an interception for Deion Jones. #Practice #Tackling

@DavidGBoden work the contract to where money is taken away if that does occur.
We saw it, it happened, no need to do it again. Especially with the wait in between attempts. Had to wait more that 20 mins to run again. The 2nd was not going to be faster than the 1st. Look at the other LBs 2nd attempts. They are all slower. https://t.co/q8p4fhOcPC
Totally agree with that, but if I’m his agent, I tell him don’t run a 2nd Time. https://t.co/1r5geYBzDR
4.38 &amp; 4.58 are 2 totally different times. Both are good but if walked away with that 4.38 on 1st attempt wouldn’t have been mad at all. Business decisions. https://t.co/ssqE1QdIwu

@georgewrighster @jrtolver16 @georgewhitfield @Eagles @NFL @footballnightsd @Akbar_Gbaja @espn @Patriots John Dorsey, Eliot Wolf, and Scot McCloughan not doing that. They are draft guys. Developers through the draft.
@georgewrighster @jrtolver16 @georgewhitfield @Eagles @NFL @footballnightsd @Akbar_Gbaja @espn @Patriots Who trading a 1st or 2nd Rounder for Foles?? Not with this crop of QBs coming out in draft. Foles fits in that system. His career has proven that. Everywhere else he struggles
@jrtolver16 @georgewrighster @georgewhitfield @Eagles @NFL @footballnightsd @Akbar_Gbaja @espn @Patriots They signed Foles to a 2yr deal before the season. Foles understands his role and just wants to do what’s asked of him by the team. Foles being there, can help Wentz’s rehab.
@jrtolver16 that is true but not when you invest on 2 drafts and multiple picks to go up and draft Wentz. The investment was made. Wentz is the guy no matter what.
@jrtolver16 @Eagles @NFL @footballnightsd @georgewrighster @Akbar_Gbaja @espn @georgewhitfield naw bruh. Carson is the golden child for Philly. Foles efforts are applauded and job well done but Wentz is the future of Eagles football.

I’m assured Patriots didn’t cover that play in practice this week. Wow
People laughed at me when I said the sight lines are different in US Bank for these kickers. Not the same backdrop they are normally used to. Similar to NCAA Basketball Tournament Final Four games played in stadiums. Sight lines different for the shooters.
@flushchaser they will take the touchdown anytime
Converting Turnovers into points
Patriots in 4:00 minute offense. Playing keep away from Philadelphia. Keep it the rest of Half and do not allow Eagles to get the ball back. Patriots get football to start 2nd half as well
First time Eagles tried the deep ball on Gilmore’s side and got burned
The Foles to Jeffery connection is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cooks ruled out for Patriots
Patriots only dressed 4 receivers along with Slater. Loss of Cooks means more Phillip Dorsett and possible more 2 Tailback sets.

The more Physical team won in both games today. Titans and Falcons brought their Hard Hats and packed a Lunch for sure.
Falcons put on a clinic tonight in form tackling. Flew around, came to balance, head across, wrapping up, leverage, etc. You name it, they did it
I said it before, Dan Quinn and Marquand Manuel did an amazing job with their Defensive game plan against the Rams. Held the NFL’s #1 Scoring Offense to just 13 points. Tip of the cap. #JobWellDone

Good things happen when you block it right up front and let Gurley take off. Add the Penalty at end and looks like Rams Sideline finally wakes up
No turnover this time.
Uh oh here we go, Brace Yourselves, a Rams Punt Return
Kudos to Dan Quinn and Marquand Manuel. They have taken away the dump off pass to Todd Gurley. Can tell the Atlanta Defense talked that a bunch this week.
Jitters for Goff. Made that pass to Gurley in his sleep all year. This one falls at his feet.
@UCLAKINGSHALOS not my point. He did a poor job of locating the flight of the Football. Should have seen flight of ball and fair caught it.

Matty Ice is looking real comfortable right now. Still the NFL’s Reigning MVP.
Seems like the Falcons have played in one of these Playoff games or two. Rams definitely tight
Special Teams have not been Special for Pro Bowler and 1st Team All Pro Pharoh Cooper so far
Rams Defense rushing only 4 men so far in pass situations and have been getting close but not yet been able to get Matt Ryan down.
McVay has to settle Goff down a bit. Not a lot of anticipation in his throws so far.
Great tackle by Poole. That would have been huge for Rams.
Night games have different sight lines. Cooper poor job of seeing flight of ball and have to do better at getting guys to get out of way. #PeterPeterPeter
First time all year that Pharoh Cooper has fielded a Punt at Night. All Rams games have been day games besides Week 3.

@JohnMiddlekauff I keep saying the same thing.
It’s amazing what the Raiders Offense can do when Carr is under Center. Opens up the playbook. Less predictable as well. Shotgun should be minimal rather than 60-70%. Lynch runs better when Carr Under Center.

McVay is slowing the game down for Jared Goff. Looks confident after coming off a not so good week of practice.

Jared Goff connected to 3 different receivers and not one named Watkins. Impressive drive by Rams. Raiders defense looked confused

Can't wait for tomorrow. Tune-in as I Tee Off. https://t.co/lxqgm8Rydo
@BIGCOONZ Hopkins is not complaining on the Texans sideline
Trust me, I love Amari Cooper but a game like this is where you have to take over and demand the football.
Wasn't Amari Cooper a Pro Bowler this year?? Been looking on the field for him today. Is he inactive?? #JustSaying
Touchdown Raiders
Cook is making throws but just not anticipating quick enough. And the drops are not helping either.
@FrancoElTanko and the Falcons schedule was better???? I'll wait..............
I want to give Texans Defense a ton of credit for today's performance but Cook just looked as if the moment was too big for him in 1st start
OMG. First Down
@Simon_Hermiz glass half full
Raiders are still 0-11 on 3rd Down
@the5holeismine or an offensive one either
Touchdown Texans. Game Over
Bad Call
Absolutely correct https://t.co/WyoIPIOQfc
Carr is more than a Quarterback for this team. He is the emotional, positive, aggressive leader that the Raiders are missing today.
Carr is a more emotional leader than those two. This team feeds off his energy. https://t.co/9SqbravnIi
Derek Carr MVP. This game is further proving how important he is for this Raiders team. Team looks lost without him.
McGloin finally up in the Bullpen like I mentioned earlier
Texans are just playing keep away now. Not trying to score but run the ball and short underneath passes. Not taking any chances.
What happened to the No-Huddle for the Raiders offense? Cook was clearly in a rhythm. Haven't seen it since the touchdown drive.
That Raider drive chart though. Sheesh
@matt_beezel you would think so
Howard has to stay tight and not allow the inside move with Murray coming to help. Opportunity wasted.
Special Teams will have to be Special and hope that the Defense can make a play for Raiders. Offensively just not in sync.
Halftime Texans 20 - Raiders 7
That injury to Hudson gave Texans a timeout
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 https://t.co/vdDvOZ51BF
Time to run the clock out. Go in to half down 13. Got some work to do.
Sean Smith missed at the line of scrimmage with his hands. Gave Hopkins the 2-way go. More of an inside alignment would've took slant away.
Can't deny that pass by Osweiler. On the money
Might be time to get McGloin up in the Bullpen
I see you Mark Davis with the Team Issue Raiders gear on. #WhoNeedsASuit
Bill O'Brien playing conservative I see. Trusting in his defense I guess. A FG is like a Touchdown with these 2 teams playing.
Both teams are a combined 2-13 on 3rd down. Raiders 0 and Texans have 2.
JJ Watt look like Fred Sanford during that workout clip
Texans 1-6 and Raiders 0-4 on 3rd Downs so far. Kind of what I expected.
Nice patience by Malcolm Smith. His alignment and technique was clinic tape on 3rd Down.
Have to tackle. Stay inside out upon approach
@ThompsonScribe sure was
@Chewdeezy I see what you did there
Crabtree chain done got snatched off already. Sheesh https://t.co/si6jNBzWrY

Crabtree not letting nobody take his chain this week
Momma there goes that man #KM52
Raiders Defense doing a terrific job in disguising coverage and blitzes. Brock Osweiler looking a little shook
That drive set a tone. Raiders Offensive Line just pushed that Texans Defensive line all the way back into the end zone for a Touchdown
Nice block by Clive on the big run by Murray
Take a shot right here Musgrave
Ouch https://t.co/Q50ob1axvg
Special Teams have to be special. That may be the Raiders best offense for today.
@ZWRaidas76 yes. 3 step drop and throw. Won't be able to hold it that long unless it's max protection.
That's a catch
Musgrave is going to have to assign help to Menelik Watson's side. No Penn in there means protections must change.
😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 https://t.co/b6qOSKxZEG
No Edge, No Chance. Touchdown Texans
Have to let Cook play. Can't babysit him the entire game
Better run away from #52's side
Huge punt by Lechler puts Oakland offense off script in its 1st drive. More plays of backed up offense rather than normal Scripted plays
Little more flexibility for Ken Norton on defense with Edwards back. Irvin can be the spinner and almost pick where he wants to rush from.
The return of Mario Edwards Jr for the Raiders helps that pass rush tremendously. Irvin and Mack lined up on same side last 3rd down
Time to do this @RAIDERS #OneNation

My thoughts exactly https://t.co/iEZ49rIioP
So who paid Tyrod?? How you getting benched for EJ Manuel?? Oh I get it, it's Rex's fault too. 🤔
His 3rd coaching hire will be the charm right?? 🤔 https://t.co/Y0IyBZ9W4R
It's hard to think as a free agent you go to Buffalo and a head coach hasn't lasted more than 4 years while you're there since Marv Levy https://t.co/Ds4azYxOpi
Firing coaches every 2 years is definitely the answer correct?? https://t.co/FixRTfXZki
Ok so 2 years of Rex and who's next??
@Briles585 not at all the reason but he could have been far worse.
Settle?? Never settling but can he get 3 years at least to turn it around https://t.co/XNo4lcljnI
10 men on the field yes is not good on any play but firing Rex over that is not fixing the problem.
Rex Ryan puts together two of the best back to back seasons for the Bills in the last 2 decades and he still gets fired. Come on Buffalo.
Buffalo Bills stay going through coaches. Smh

Facts: In Jared Goff's 4 starts so far this season, Rams Offense is 11-49 (22%) on 3rd Down. Not all QB's fault but offense was Vanilla.
(2/2) through the motions. No life, no bounce, no energy amongst the players. Todd Gurley's comments were what he wanted to say all season.
I said it yesterday while watching the game and during practices the last couple of weeks, really felt like Rams players just going (1/2)
@rgalatioto9 negative ghost rider
We never play well in December anyway #CowboyFansThoughts
Tony Romo would have brought us back tonight #CowboyFansThoughts

Rams Nissan Postgame Show about to begin shortly on @ESPNLosAngeles. Should be interesting to say the least. (877)710-ESPN
I need help describing this Rams performance today vs the Falcons. In one word tell me what you think??
This Rams performance today is just unacceptable
Pick 6. Jared Goff to Deion Jones of the Falcons. Falcons 21 - Rams 0
Falcons making it look easy vs the Rams. No Sanu, No Jones, No Problem. Falcons 14 - Rams 0 early 2nd quarter.
Wow that escalated fast. Fumbled opening Kickoff by Rams, Falcons first play touchdown pass to Hardy from Matt Ryan. 10 secs off the clock.
JFF is alive and well https://t.co/SZ8kUBGemN

First full game for everybody out there. On defense you will see more shoulder and head leading. Technique and wrap just not there yet.
Week 1 you are going to see a ton of hits to the head like we saw against Cam. The fines will start coming in next week and hits will stop.
In crunch time, Panthers offensive line couldn't protect Cam. That Denver defense is something else. Relentless until the final whistle.
