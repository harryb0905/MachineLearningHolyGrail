new Apple Music: Stream any song. Beats1 24/7 radio station and a social network to lure artists to talk to fans. But no pricing info yet...
Tim Cook trying to restore Apple's music franchise to former glory with Apple streaming svc. Now @interscopejimmy on stage
Car charging-level icon in Watch OS 2 seems like a nice bookmark for the eventual Apple Car....

the Craig Federigni show is over. Tim Cook back on stage #WWDC15
Federigni: we think Swift is the programming language for the next 20 yrs, then makes it open source to huge applause from the #WWDC devs
Federigni cont.: iOS 9 improves battery life by 1 hour with switch for "low power mode" that pulls levers "you didn't even know existed."
@StevenLevy so old-school.
Apparently instead of buying Flipboard, Apple just decided to copy it with its new News app #WWDC15
Here's a new iOS app - News. "beautiful content from the world's greatest sources, personalized" says Federighi. Replaces newsstand?
Apple's Jennifer Bailey: 1 million locales taking Apple Pay Discover Crd adopting this fall. Integrating with Pinterest and to UK nxt month
Federighi says Apple not sending ID'd Siri queries to the cloud a la Google. "We honestly just dont want to know."
Siri getting proactive, matching Google Now; plug in headphones, offers music. Presenting traffic conditions on home screen caller ID. #WWDC
Federighi on ioS: 83 percent iPhone owners run latest OS, 12 percent Android users. Yeah ugh my Android still running Kitkat
federighi selling the heck out of this nice but relatively minor OSX update. #WWDC15 1.4x speed boost in launching apps he says.
Craig Federighi showing natural language Spotlight searches in OSX El Capitan. Would love this, if it actually works. #WWDC

Amazon brings the weird with Gary Busey ad for new Fire TV: http://t.co/yv8yNXn6Vm
to Amazon's credit, the FireTV seems far more polished than other Amazon v1s, like the original Kindle and first Kindle Fire
Got a free HDMI port on your HDTV? Amazon FireTV: $99 on sale today.
Typical Amazon: its app store doesn't have the game variety of Google or Apple app stores. So it forms a studio and makes games itself.
So its Amazon FireTV. Watching this from afar, looks interesting but not necessarily hugely raising the bar in the living room war.
that's all. btw the Amazon set-top device was code-named Bueller, after Ferris. Also known as Project E inside Lab126.
more KindleTV 4) Has Amazon’s lavishly funded Lab126 division produced something beautiful, easy to use and worthy of the living room?
3/ How integrated are buying opportunities? IMDB scanning all movies and pulling out merchandise, so you can buy the Bond girls' outfit….
2/Will Amazon give KindleTV owners free digital copies of DVDs they previously bought? (would be huge, like AutoRip for music.)
Things to Watch at today's KindleTV unveil. 1/ In a crowded market, does the Amazon box have any advantages over Roku, AppleTV, Chromecast?
@fmanjoo unless you need material for your satirical novel: no.

yet another tablet: Bezos unveils Kindle Fire HD with 4G LTE wireless- for $499. Bill of materials approach the selling price, he says.
actually this quote from bezos "We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices" is a dig at Apple.
Bezos: "We want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices" Betting on razor blades, not razors.
jumbo Kindle Fire HD is not quite iPad sized- 8.9 inch vs. 9.7 inch.
Whispersync for Voice - listen to an audiobook on the way home, then pick it up in text on the Kindle. Bezos calls this "bimodal reading."
Amazon reversing course on the Kindle Fire; last year's tablet was bare-bones. This year they are packing features into the Fire HD.
new Kindle Fire $159 and ships A beefier Kindle Fire HD comes in 7 inch and jumbo iPad size. Amazon v Apple, it's on.
for someone with an electrical engineering degree, Bezos sure does hate to put actual numbers on the Y and X axis of his graphs...
actually 3G Paperwhite version costs $179. Wifi only is $119. basic barebones Kindle is $69.
new Kindle Paperwhite costs $119 and ships in October. free 3G.
V cool new Kindle feature projects time it takes to finish chapter and time to finish book. Adjusts to your individual reading speed.
Bezos holding new Kindle Paperwhite device w front-lit screen to match Nook with Glow light. 8 weeks of battery;apparently its great in bed!
bezos: Last year there were more than two dozen android tablets.. nobody bought them. Why: because they are gadgets... People want services.

Schiller talking up new voice-activated iPhone assistant, called Siri; Apple acquired this company of same name in 2010.
iPhone 4s has both CDMA and GSM antennas and switches between them; 8 megapixel camera.
Schiller now on to the.... iPhone 4S. with a new Apple designed A5 chip, faster graphics processor and OMG why am i advertising for Apple.
Apple kills iPod Classic music player? it doesnt make Phil Schiller's holiday lineup...

new open graph: users can post to FB that they reviewed a restaurant, read a book, listened to a song - and not just "liked" these things.
i cant wait to post my bar-mitzvah video on FB Timeline. really. cant wait.
FB Timeline asking users to locate where theyve visited and lived - aint that a Google+ feature? - and using Bing maps, to boot.
Timeline lets you "tell the whole story of your life in a single page," sez Zuck.
Zuck announcing redesigned profile page called 'timeline'. Includes stories, apps, 'a new way to express who you are.' Looks kinda MySpacey

Yesterday I reactivated the phone - and it works. kudos to the manufacturer. #DroidIncredible #HTC #miraclesofmoderntech
It sat underwater for 10 minutes before I found it. I took out the battery & put it in a bin of uncooked rice and left it there for 4 days.
true story: last week i accidentally laundered my cell phone #DroidIncredible. Put it in the wash with a bin of laundry. (more)

Absolutely loved #super8
Spending the day at #e3; what *must* I check out?
wonder if iCloud works over Web with html 5... otherwise its Apple-only, and an opportunity for #Google and #Amazon to be more inclusive.
Jobs showing photo of new NC data center... "if you dont think we are serious about this, you are wrong."
and costs $25 a year to store 5000 songs.
iTunes Match: Apple quickly scans and matches 'non itunes music' in your library (uploads songs it doesnt recognize), upgrades quality
one more thing, sez Steve. ah here we go on non-purchased music. #piracyamnesty.
up to 10 devices can download your digital music... but still, only purchased music from iTunes. no word on ripped music... yet?
methinks iTunes in the cloud gives Apple room to roll out a new line of wirelessly-enabled iPod Nanos and such.
Songs you have *already bought* sit on iCloud, can be manually downloaded to any Apple device, at no additional charge.
and now #music, and iTunes in the cloud.
all these iCloud features create a big hairy new lock-in to the Apple ecosystem.
Photo Stream stores pics on iCloud and auto-downloads to other Apple devices. This solves photo sprawl, a pretty big consumer problem...
WiFi collapsing at wwdc under weight of jobsnote. Seems only purchased music gets uploaded to icloud?
iCloud uploads content (photos etc) automatically and automatically distributes to all your iOS devices. "it just all works" Jobs sez.
model of PC at center of digital life has "broken down" Jobs says. "keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy."
Steve Jobs back on stage to talk iCloud and the future of music.
iOS 5 shipping this fall, Scott Forstall sez - likely coincides with introduction of iPhone 5.
#appl stock down slightly. wonder if that's on Steve's lack of stage-time so far.
"especially with Ipad we are ushering in a post-PC world" sez Scott Forstall. can activate Iphones, ipads without syncing to PCs.
Safari Reader, - tap "reader" button, zap ads in a story and put in single-scroll format. "Gets rid of all the distractions." hmmm
interesting, deeper Twitter integration into iOS and Apple's own apps, like photo tool, Safari and Maps.
first new feature for iOS 5 for iPhone, iPad: all new notifications from apps combined on one screen (doesnt android have this?)
after demo of new Mail in Lion OS, Schiller sez no discs, available as 4GB download in Mac App store at $29
no more lost work in Mac OS X Lion: 'Resume' which opens apps like Word at exact last point where user left it;  more robust 'autosave'
Mac OS X Lion includes cues from iPad's iOS. among new features: multi-touch gesture interface, apps can be enlarged to full screen...
@pschiller on Mac. While PC market shrank, Mac market grew 28 percent. And laptops are 3/4 of Macs shipped by Apple.
#WWDC Steve Jobs on stage briefly before kicking to Phil Schiller: software "is the soul" of our products.
Good preview of today's Apple event by @satariano via BloombergNow http://t.co/55LikwV
