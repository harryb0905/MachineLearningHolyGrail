@Sportsnet @BudweiserCanada Not sure why Grapes is carving the @NHLCanes , he was the inspiration!  He says, "why can't they be like everybody else" but yet, he wears those fun/ridiculous jackets, no? I'm sure they're saying "why can't he be like everybody else."
@NHLJets There’s a lot of guys in this league who should watch and learn how to get their mind and body ready for when the puck drops at opening Faceoff.  Wheeler is one of the best leaders in #NHL who rarely takes a shift off, if ever.

@DrewCormier Totally agree.  I pointed that out a couple games ago as well, with a player I won’t name.. but, you have to 100% when jumping to offense.  You’ll get the benefit when jumping on early to defend.
No, it’s called sticking the landing.  Or the pants stuck the landing.  Not nailed. https://t.co/jnRZccGh8K

@krder23sharks @sharkvoice @BrodieNBCS @DanRusanowsky @Bakes_Jamie13 @krder23sharks DPS timed the hit.  It was not late. Looked at the contact and said it was Shoulder in Chest.  Lastly, although none of us like the timing, score or time has no relevance.
@Apryl404 @ApryI404 NHL looks at all hits. They do a good job and although we don’t always agree on their decision or non decisions, they’re all pros inside that decision room.  Thanks for your comment
@coomesharksfan @coomesharksfan I don’t disagree with that! First one never should’ve counted, and the 2nd was probably over the bar.
@goldieonice @Barkovsasha95 @JonnyHuby11 Congrats Goldie!  Proud to say I’ve called games with you buddy!  Heck of an accomplishment!  Cheers to the next 1000!

@unixwizard @sharkvoice @SanJoseSharks Thought so too on first look, but an overhead camera never showed the puck clearly going over the line when Jones swiped it away.  So... NHL said McDavid scored it.  Mmmm.

@srunge2 The players know, and if a ref picks it up, typically it’s because a player asked the official to grab it for the team/player.
@dapete Agreed! But we always have video for them to watch which the fans don’t know.   Give him a lot of credit for doing awesome job tho on that interview.
Came across this image of Sidney Crosby. 1 of his many attributes that make him such a gr8 player is that he's an amazing skater. Knee bend &amp; full extension are parts of it, but you also need to keep your shoulders parallel to the ice when turning/carving, giving you balance/pwr. https://t.co/kNmWCUXwhz

@LaughlinSXM Redonculous vocals!
Sometimes big pressure moments give you a clarity that allows your mind to free itself, and to see every moment for what it is, just a moment to enjoy and a moment to treat people the right way.
Trotz cont: "If you don’t, I’m not going to think so much of you. And I started getting that clarity that everybody looks for the wrong in people rather than the right.”
If the @Capitals were to win tonight, the clarity of coach Barry Trotz thoughts, will be one of the many obvious reasons why.  “I have clarity,” Trotz said "If you’re a good person &amp; you treat people right &amp; you live your life right, then I’m going to think really highly of you."

Just like I thought the @GoldenKnights built some belief+momentum in the losing effort in Game 1, I feel @NHLJets built that exact same belief+momentum tonight in Game 3 in the 3rd.  #StanleyCupPlayoffs2018 Should be an amazing Game 4.
For me, those were the best saves in the #StanleyCupPlayoffs2018, in succession, by @GoldenKnights Marc-André Fleury in the 3rd Period to secure the win.  30 saves by him in the final 2 periods.  #NHLPlayoffs
@DNS107 @BarSouthNCelly He tells you exactly what he expects.  No gray area, which as an athlete, is exactly what you want!
@BrumfieldRandy @NHLJets Yes.  Coached us to a Stanley Cup Final in 2002 vs the Detroit Red Wings.
This is a great piece on @NHLJets Head Coach Paul Maurice.  As someone who played 17 years in the NHL, Paul is one of the best coaches I ever had, and I couldn’t be happier for his teams success this year. #NHLPlayoffs  https://t.co/UA7rxvVRdK

@LVSportsCentric @ESPNLasVegas @stevecofield @AdamHillLVRJ Wait... I talked down about #VGK ? Really?!   I said nothing of the sort.  I did nothing but talk them up. Yes, they played at the end of the year, Sharks had some injuries &amp; coming off a Nashville game.  Look, the Sharks are improved and going to be a great series.
Not sure how many more kicks at the can I get at this “Father Daughter Dance” but until it ends I’ll continue to feel like the luckiest dad in the world! #prouddad https://t.co/gaFQ1h2m3O

@wickidnik @kinglinguist @MarkDParrish @NikkiMarie_p @SCSUHUSKIES @bocce13 @Chris_Hawkey @OurJacques Ah..ya... you’d be the only genius.
@Jfredrix No.  Look, work to get over to the puck and wait to touch it until someone comes over to you, then touch it, particularly in the D-zone.  I don’t think he realized there was a guy on his back.  He thought he had more time to kill, clearly he didn’t.
@Jfredrix Worked out because their chance hit the post.
Well, the stats prove what my eyes were seeing. #solid https://t.co/myoRaNiefk
Jason Zucker of the @mnwild has always been a favorite of mine to watch, especially because he’s what Hockey in MN is all about - hard working, honest Hockey! His journey &amp; the importance of decisions that come before us that take us to our destiny.👍  https://t.co/UKT0ouyodG

@FrancesssStyles @sharkvoice Please tell me more!
@Jfredrix @PirainoVincenzo @CurtisPashelka Yes, this is Onside.  So, it was a good non-challenge by Deboer, which would have put the Caps on a PP after they had just scored. https://t.co/FFBdn82aJ0

@MGeschwind What are you asking? Have you never heard that phrase before? Or you want an explanation?
Totally agree Bob.  This is when you stick together.  You hunker down and stand by each other.  Don’t look for an easy way out.  The only way out is together, with the group you have.  A lot of good/smart people who are a part of that team.  #ManUp #StickTogether https://t.co/TEBF34fDwE

@JoshuaCooper Albeit very subtle, it was a penalty. Seeing who the offender was, well, it's getting called.
@JoshuaCooper After slashing a linesman earlier in the year, they've been probably waiting to call it in him.

@B_I_G___D Look, I was watching the same game as you. Oilers outplayed &amp; outhit Sharks. Most hits were clean. I didn't like the dangerous ones.
@mike_p_johnson So what you're saying Mr. Johnson is if we were to replace Dillon's head with yours, that still would be clean?
@whitlextaylor I suppose it wasn't a charge either?

.@NHL Rule 49.2 "A goal cannot be scored by an attacking player who uses a distinct kicking motion to propel the puck into the net."

@Luke_Doctor1 Oh boy Luke. U see a different gm then I do. Thought it was a good hockey game &amp; Sharks had advantage in prime scoring chances
@k2rider No doubt. I love his game and agree defense &amp; GA is a "team" thing. Just making a point of the numbers is all. Thanks for the note!

Since the intro of the #NHL fwd pass, no player has scored all of teams goals over a 6 game span. Kopitar 3g for @LAKings over last 6 gms.
Just think, if @Broncos don't score, this game would have been over :12 sec, 1 snap, 2 pts into this game!
@_brandonpenrod she was great too but this guy Mars is amazing. Not too many bands sound better live but he's one of them!
Best half time show ever! #BrunoMars #Awesome #talent

@Awassers Yes.  I believe he is a guy you bring to Sochi.
Good pace to that first period of @SanJoseSharks vs @Avalanche game. 1-0 Avs on MacKinnon PP Goal. How dangerous is Matt Duchene?

@Barrow_Jake Ha! That's good!!
Nail Yakupov must have heard me from the press box for lack luster 1st. Cashed in on high slot scoring chance. 4-1 @SanJoseSharks lead.
Edm Oilers continue to turn the puck over compounded without stopping &amp; starting leads to @Logancouture 200 career pt. 4-0 @SanJoseSharks
@KKurzCSN @SportsnetSpec And I can see why with 3 terrible give-aways within the 1st 15 minutes of first frame one led to a goal.
The @SanJoseSharks up 2-0 already and Marleau just scored his 18th of the year, 422 #NHL goal tying Owen Nolan 73rd all time!

Huge PK for #sjsharks to end this game in OT and now 3rd straight Shoot Out in a row! 1-1 tie. Who wins? Who scores?
Can you say redemption! Havlat ties game for #sjsharks PP goal 1-1 #NHL
@Dekal1Thc Only thing we can find is 3 OT/SO in 4 gms! Never 3 SO's in a row. Thanks for the question!
Sharkie is so bored that he's been relegated to eat @brodiebrazilCSN head! 0-0 28 shots total from both teams combined 4:00 to go in 2nd.
Havlat had a legit open net but thought the puck had already gone in. Unfortunate for #sjsharks #NHL.Gm has been like watching paint dry 0-0
Yep! RT @ben_clymer: Can't wait WCHA leading @stcloudstate in action. A serious threat this yr. I can see @BretHedican &amp; M. Parrish smiling
@JovanHeer excuse me?
What a hockey game in tonight #sjsharks vs #oilers ! 2-2 end of OT. Great pace back and forth fun to watch! #NHL
@isabelleklea14 absolutely! Clowe, Couture &amp; Gomez have looked great this game! Thanks for that assist!
@BretHedican: Logan Couture just scored the 1st goal for #sjsharks &amp; pays homage to #SF49ers @kaepernick7 by kissing the gun! 2-1 #NHL
I stand corrected! Couture scored first goal! Thanks! 3 goals came so quick!
@AsSharksRaiders Nice call! I'll keep a look out for it! Thanks for the support! Have a great Superbowl weekend! #questforsix
@Ddoucet46 If only I could go back in time and enjoy one more time! Thanks for sharing that thought! I appreciate it!
@emesef Ha! Thanks Em! Yes, the Sharks win was the highlight!
@mike22201184 Thanks a lot Mike! I appreciate the feedback! Go Sharks!
Keep an eye on this Stanley Cup Champion @ben_clymer who's doing an amazing job as n analyst for FSN! Great job bud! Follow him #NHL
Congrats to great hockey player @OwenNolan11 on his new show! Take a look a sneak peak! https://t.co/ioWKxakJ  #NHL
Congrats to one of my best buds Greg Gartner for article in Huffington Post! Best wedding sites you've never heard of! http://t.co/bRYPf0qy
@GregRajan thanks 4 the note! 94 Finals was incredible, but every series I ever played in was unique, made me better, &amp; taught me how to win
@Estebomb @flyers_faithful thanks guys for having me on!
36 points for the trio of Marleau, Thornton &amp; Pavelski. I'd say they are En Fuego! #NHL
@Wing_Nut1936 I don't believe multi-goal games to start the season for 5 straight games has ever been done.
@MikeGT79 Thanks Mike! Great memories of my Vancouver days!
@pambcloud @esbee92 Thanks Pam for sharing that! Eric Staal is a great player &amp; even better person!
Patrick Marleau stays hot! Insane PP movement by #sjsharks &amp; gets goal off skate! In chase of history now! No player #NHL history 2 g's 5gms
Starting to get revved up here @CSNAuthentic #NOLA Watch all week for the best #49ers coverage! #questforsix #bestinthebusiness
Congrats Boys! RT @rosterbot: RESULT: Team @rosterbot takes the Apex tourney w/decisive 9-4 win over Mule.3-0 record. http://t.co/O0r0ZxDA
@ben_clymer @fsnorth @gopherhockey Who's that team on top? Go Huskies! #WCHA
@MikeMatthews9 This will be debated &amp; tough call. We've slowed it down and shoulder hits shoulder first then chin, didn't leave feet.
Thought Stuart hit was clean, replay shows he led with shoulder &amp; elbow came up after shoulder contact. Don't think suspendible. #NHL
Matt Irwin with his first #NHL goal! Its a highlight real goal! Congrats!
Did they just change the assist to Pavelski on the Thornton goal? Looks like I get to fire @ScottReissCSN ! Who can do post-show with me?
@ScottReissCSN I guess I should pack my bags! ha!
I stand corrected, assist awarded to Clowe. Still impressive Pavelski with 8 assists to start season. #NHL
Thornton now on score sheet. 3-0 another PP goal. Quietest 9 assists to start the season Joe Pavelski!
Marleau 2nd player in #NHL history to start season with 4 multi scoring games. #NHL #hotasapistol #sjsharks
Landeskog gets caught on the RR Tracks and takes big hit by Brad Stuart. 2-0 after 1 period.
Wish I were there boys! RT @rosterbot: Hey @BretHedican what you're missing: http://t.co/SYieUhAO

I echo! "@brianlawton9: I would have to say @SanJoseSharks have one of the best coaching staffs in #NHL with T Mac, L Robinson &amp; J Johnson"
The #SJShark Boyle 5/3 PP executed perfectly, &amp; another PP goal by Couture to make 2-0 only 5 min in. #NHL
Lets get it on! "Jam-packed #sjsharks pregame show at 6:30pm on CSN California @Bakes_Jamie13 @KKurzCSN &amp; @brodiebrazilCSN Ready to Rock!"
That would be Scott Gomez in a Shark uniform. No contract I'm hearing yet, but he's skating wearing 23.  #NHL http://t.co/VvyruPHy
Talked w/ Doug Wilson &amp; said "no deal yet for Gomez. Seeing if this is going to work for him &amp; us" #NHL I smell some smoke there may b fire?
Scott Gomez will not skate in practice with team today, but will probably skate after practice. #NHL
OK, Scott Gomez is in San Jose going through the physicals &amp; to see if this is going to work for both parties. #NHL
