@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 They are not ‚Äúmy fellow Christians‚Äù. And it‚Äôs your insistence that they are that puzzles me. I simply suggested that Christians.. and I am assuming a genuine belief... can worship together and do all the time.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 Are those the people coming to church to speak like you said? I doubt it. Those people sell Christ they don‚Äôt live Christ. The question is what will We do?

@GodsProphet3000 @ImJustMe1979 Then they were never truly Christians in the first place and should not disdain the name of good Christians by hanging around.
@ImJustMe1979 @GodsProphet3000 More people voted for democrats in the last 2 years than republicans. You seem insistent on making this place more racist than it is rather than trying to heal the divisions that exist. I am not sure why.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 So because of the actions of those awful people making a mockery of the teachings of Christ we should all just stay that way? Divided?

@POTENTIALJUROR @rob_mellon @TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 And it should our goal to end that as well, not insist upon it. Right?
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 Millions of Christians pray every single day for the family of humanity under god to come together beyond prejudice and hatred. Clearly you think they are liars, fools or both. I would rather be self-righteous than dismissive of the righteous altogether.
@ImJustMe1979 There is nothing better than wanting people of the same belief to be able to sit under the same roof and worship the same god with live and acceptance. And sitting back while someone insists on More segregation, regardless of their title or claim to piety, is morally wrong.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 The level of judgement about large populations of Christians both black and white is my point. Rather than call out hypocrites By Name, you lay a label of hypocrite on churchgoers themselves. You can not defeat prejudice by displaying it with such wanton disregard.

There is no such thing as a "Disorder" unless an Order exists. There is normal and abnormal because things can vary from a "norm"  But the word "disorder" sells more pills.  Psychologists are insane
d)And why would the idea that eating fried fast food killing you early be News?!?   and E) it was death "from all causes" so, Apparently, eating KFC DAILY raises your chance of being hit by a bus, being murdered and slipping on a banana peel and falling into a chipper/shredder https://t.co/kMVRiJbAJm
Also @soledadobrien he is most often portrayed as fat in drawings which limits, in these kinds of cartoons, wrinkles in favor of bulges
@maraleia Not all masculinity is toxic though and there is currently no distinction being made. you rarely hear the word masculinity without toxic being added to it and it's almost never positive.
@FrankBonini @CBSLA Right? Holy shit! and it says "At Least"!... and the word "enjoyed" seems a little out of placeüò≥
a) ya mean "premature" death... death.. in general, is 100% certain  b) "women who enjoyed fried chicken at least once a day had a 13% higher risk of death from any cause" - AT LEAST once a day.. AT LEAST?? c) This is not about fried food it's about FAST FOOD (Read it 1st @CBSLA) https://t.co/t5BDAzmwx4
Because in the cartoon he's a toddler. Believe me... no one thinks he has good skin... no one... https://t.co/erzeyrtz5h
One need only read their recommendations on how to reach women versus how to reach men to notice a fundamental bias based on their own limited view of "order". It's almost as if they are unable to consider that their perspective may be simply a Hive Bias.
@maraleia They weren't before either. The only change has been the approach. And a good number of men who commit suicide so after seeking or being ordered into therapy. I'm not saying its a direct correlation but it's not promising
I'm good with Senator Harris running. you? https://t.co/Zn9hDIfugE
Anyone else notice that ever since the American Psychological Association has begun to push men away from stoicism and "traditional masculinity" the suicide rate has gone up not down? Curious that
