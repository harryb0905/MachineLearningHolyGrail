@2tall4u2 @GeorgeTakei It always changes. But its a big meal. 2400+ calories in one sitting. I keep my carbs low but I don't believe in cutting them to zero. NO extremity. just a big healthy meal. I also minimize sugar. I cut it by 60%

History Lesson: Hams  Comedians were called “Hams” because minstrel performers and clowns used pig fat to take their make up off.   They smelled like Ham.  Referred to as “Ham-fat men” it was later shortened to Ham.

@caroljsroth Trump’s stock “gains” started at his election. No actual policies had been implemented. They were based on hope. His Actual moves economically requires enormous Ag welfare spending, doubling the deficit, increased military spending. It’s Government stimulus.
@caroljsroth Agreed. His economic impact is his tax bill, an acceleration of coal plant closures and factories that never materialized. And if his Ag Sec hadn’t sold all the rotting soybeans China isn’t buying to the EU to grind into biofuel and paid off farmers with a bail out... 🔥
@caroljsroth It is not unlikely at all. Assumes facts not in evidence.

@caroljsroth There is no debate that at the end of the Bush presidency we were in big trouble with No guarantee we would dodge an actual depression. The same forces that call the Obama gains luck, accident or deny them entirely are saying “well, Trump is Obviously good for the economy”. Nope
@caroljsroth Indirectly because all his gains are based on “mood” and “potential deregulation benefits” not actual material growth. Especially the first 13 months where he saw the Most gains and no policy had actually been implemented. December had the worst consumer Christmas since 2007

HEY!... @MSNBC Peeps..  The "thing of Value" that The #Enquirer was extorting out of @JeffBezos was not blowing up their non-prosecution agreement with Mueller. Which has HUGE legal and financial impact on the company and individuals involved.   They KNOW Bezos will find Crimes.

@grahamburgers @DelShores @Bakari_Sellers I don’t know. I didn’t hear his entire story. And there are always gaps in a retelling. My point is less about him and more about us.. as people 🙃
The #Qanon saps were predicting that Trump was planning to arrest Adam Schiff before the SOTU.. Schiff is on tv being interviewed live soooo.. 😂😂😂  Also: they call trump “The Maestro” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 yeah..😂  And they think he misspells words On Purpose as a Code 😂😂😂

@Bakari_Sellers @DelShores I’ll trust a poor southern Liberal way easier than a rich northern one. I Know they can grow.
@Bakari_Sellers @DelShores I’m less impressed with people who grew up in completely Liberal environments who behave well than I am with people who grew up in a nest of hatred and racism and found their way to being a better person.
Soooo tonight... which one will show up?
@Bakari_Sellers @DelShores I know many people who grew up with bigoted/prejudiced parents and grew into decent people. I know they were not the purist of thinkers when they were young. But we’re lucky to have them now. I hope we can talk about this with patience and introspection
@DelShores @iMakeArtifacts @Bakari_Sellers That’s what I’m curious about... should something just heal in silence or should you ever share character defects that you have shame about and have dropped?

@DelShores @Bakari_Sellers Honest question: if anyone has a realization that they have racists beliefs that run deep and then decide to eradicate them and work on them, should that person ever mention that? I grew up around people I know dealt with what for them was a generational change.

Your reaction to a joke says more about you than the teller. Often those offended by jokes are projecting their own fear that they cannot control their moral shortcomings. This is why the genuinely dangerous comedians are often “clean” comedians.  Here Endeth the lesson

@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 And for the record I give those guys Hell ALL THE TIME.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 They are not “my fellow Christians”. And it’s your insistence that they are that puzzles me. I simply suggested that Christians.. and I am assuming a genuine belief... can worship together and do all the time.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 Are those the people coming to church to speak like you said? I doubt it. Those people sell Christ they don’t live Christ. The question is what will We do?
@MrMokelly @ImJustMe1979 But you are now. That’s like saying that since scumbags like Strom Thurman fought for Miscegenation laws that people of different races should still not marry or fall in love now.. today.
@ImJustMe1979 It’s not a “take”
@Ndymium6 @ImJustMe1979 Did I lay blame Anywhere? I think segregation is Wrong. Period.
@ChunxOfEarth He was a racist monster. What does that have to do with millions of actual Christians who worship the same god?
@waynefresh1 And I would argue that is a Bad Thing
@JAlmerini Both. I’m arguing Against it altogether
@GodsProphet3000 @ImJustMe1979 Then they were never truly Christians in the first place and should not disdain the name of good Christians by hanging around.
@ImJustMe1979 @GodsProphet3000 More people voted for democrats in the last 2 years than republicans. You seem insistent on making this place more racist than it is rather than trying to heal the divisions that exist. I am not sure why.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 So because of the actions of those awful people making a mockery of the teachings of Christ we should all just stay that way? Divided?

@POTENTIALJUROR @rob_mellon @TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 And it should our goal to end that as well, not insist upon it. Right?
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 Millions of Christians pray every single day for the family of humanity under god to come together beyond prejudice and hatred. Clearly you think they are liars, fools or both. I would rather be self-righteous than dismissive of the righteous altogether.
@ImJustMe1979 There is nothing better than wanting people of the same belief to be able to sit under the same roof and worship the same god with live and acceptance. And sitting back while someone insists on More segregation, regardless of their title or claim to piety, is morally wrong.
@TalbertSwan @ImJustMe1979 The level of judgement about large populations of Christians both black and white is my point. Rather than call out hypocrites By Name, you lay a label of hypocrite on churchgoers themselves. You can not defeat prejudice by displaying it with such wanton disregard.

Trump - “when I ended the horrible Iran nuclear deal- it was a horrible deal done by President Obama and John Kerry that didn't know what the hell he was doing. When I ended that deal, Margaret, all of a sudden Iran became a different country.”    Oh FFS...
@PeteinCA Glad to hear it :) Call back any time Pete!

“We're going to keep watching and we're going to keep seeing and if there's trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we're going to know it before they do.” - Trump on FTN   Clearly Trump doesn’t need his intel chiefs..he has Psychics! 🙄
Trump- “No, because I want to be able to watch Iran. All I want to do is be able to watch. We have an unbelievable and expensive military base built in Iraq. It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up.”  #WTF
On Obama - “When he chose not to do that, he showed tremendous weakness. But we didn't have Syria whereas we had Iraq. So when he did what he did in Iraq, which was a mistake. Being in Iraq was a mistake. Okay. Being in Iraq- it was a big mistake to go- “ 🤨
“MARGARET BRENNAN: But you- but you also campaigned saying that, you know, President Obama made a big mistake by telegraphing his military moves. You're telegraphing your retreat. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not telegraphing anything.  No, no, no. There's a difference.”  1/2

“A wonderful kindergarten” ...a...WHAT?!? https://t.co/84EsHh3v0V
"My intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100 percent. It is a vicious country that kills many people," Trump said  This from the guy who Constantly defends Putin and Russia... CONSTANTLY. 🐴💩
“I went to Iraq recently, if you look at Syria, what's happened in Syria in the last few weeks, you would see that things are going down that were not going down. That things are happening that are very good. So I was not happy with him, but I wish him well." Trump on Mattis 🤦🏻‍♂️
"We're going to keep watching and we're going to keep seeing and if there's trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we're going to know it before they do." - Trump   Wh...I...what the...Wh...
"Well, we spent a fortune on building this incredible base. We might as well keep it. And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem," Trump said   😑 https://t.co/3s530ZipkN

There is no such thing as a "Disorder" unless an Order exists. There is normal and abnormal because things can vary from a "norm"  But the word "disorder" sells more pills.  Psychologists are insane
d)And why would the idea that eating fried fast food killing you early be News?!?   and E) it was death "from all causes" so, Apparently, eating KFC DAILY raises your chance of being hit by a bus, being murdered and slipping on a banana peel and falling into a chipper/shredder https://t.co/kMVRiJbAJm
Also @soledadobrien he is most often portrayed as fat in drawings which limits, in these kinds of cartoons, wrinkles in favor of bulges
@maraleia Not all masculinity is toxic though and there is currently no distinction being made. you rarely hear the word masculinity without toxic being added to it and it's almost never positive.
@FrankBonini @CBSLA Right? Holy shit! and it says "At Least"!... and the word "enjoyed" seems a little out of place😳
a) ya mean "premature" death... death.. in general, is 100% certain  b) "women who enjoyed fried chicken at least once a day had a 13% higher risk of death from any cause" - AT LEAST once a day.. AT LEAST?? c) This is not about fried food it's about FAST FOOD (Read it 1st @CBSLA) https://t.co/t5BDAzmwx4

One need only read their recommendations on how to reach women versus how to reach men to notice a fundamental bias based on their own limited view of "order". It's almost as if they are unable to consider that their perspective may be simply a Hive Bias.
@maraleia They weren't before either. The only change has been the approach. And a good number of men who commit suicide so after seeking or being ordered into therapy. I'm not saying its a direct correlation but it's not promising
I'm good with Senator Harris running. you? https://t.co/Zn9hDIfugE

This would make Trump criminally liable for the Father-in-laws crimes as an accessory after the fact and interfering with Law Enforcement.  Trump is as guilty for the Father-in-laws crimes as HE is if he has been aware of the crimes and protecting him from the DOJ
There are TWO witness tampering crimes that Trump could be guilty of-  1st - the obvious threats to prosecute his family members if he testifies  2nd - and more interesting - Trump has been Stifling investigations into Cohens in-laws and is threatening to stop
