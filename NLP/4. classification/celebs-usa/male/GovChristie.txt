Heading to Manchester, NH today for a book signing at the Barnes &amp; Noble for my new book “Let Me Finish”, now a @nytimes Best Seller for three weeks running. Please join us at 3pm today in Manchester, NH
Great round table today on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos
For the third week in a row, my new book “Let Me Finish” has made The NY Times best seller list. This week we rose from the number 10 position to the 8 position. Thanks to all of you readers who are enjoying the book and making this all possible.
Just had a great conversation with @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews on 2020 and @SenKamalaHarris on the “joy” of pot in the middle of a brutal opioid and overdose crisis. Not what America needs right now—the “joy” of more illegal drugs

So sorry for all the Chiefs fans...what a great game. And, .@metheridge great job on the national anthem https://t.co/0gBxfWQa4t
The recent comments from @SteveKingIA were reprehensible &amp; should be repugnant to any American, whether they come from an elected official or your next door neighbor. It is unacceptable to me and to anyone, I suspect, who has lent him support over his career. Shame on him.
Happy birthday to my friend @laurenfritts https://t.co/lA5KbMkBUu
For all those who were throwing hate at Notre Dame when they lost to Clemson by 27 points saying they didn’t deserve to be in the #CFPChampionship—take a look at tonight. Clemson beats Alabama by 28. Clemson is #1 over everyone—by a long shot. #GoIrish

My condolences to the family of former Puebla Governor Rafael Moreno Valle and his wife, current Governor Martha Erika Alonso. They died tonight in a helicopter crash. They hosted us on our trade mission to Mexico. Puebla is NJ’s sister Mexican state. I am sick over this loss.
It is this type of wit which you are so well known for....#Dadjokes https://t.co/EKoPbrTlLl

This is a great first step. We did similar reform in NJ while I was Governor &amp; crime is down &amp; so is the prison population. A great win for .@realDonaldTrump &amp; for the folks in Congress. The effort couldn’t have been successful w/o the relentless work of Jared Kushner. Big win. https://t.co/rIqRVAtrhh
Great to be with my friend ⁦@ScottWalker⁩ tonight at the White House Christmas party. I enjoyed campaigning for Scott in 2010, 2012 and, as RGA Chairman, in 2014. He is a strong leader and helped many Wisconsin citizens get back to work in his 8 yrs as Governor. Merry Xmas! https://t.co/Dq55ns05X1

Will be on @ThisWeekABC to discuss the actions by the Southern District of NY and Bob Mueller with @danabrams and @MarthaRaddatz. Please watch after another fascinating week.
A very important development &amp; one the President’s Commission felt was vital to stemming the tide of overdose deaths in America. Congrats to @realDonaldTrump for securing this agreement and now let’s make sure the Chinese follow through and work with law enforcement to save lives https://t.co/vkF0ywrnri
Wonderfully emotional words from @VP in the Capitol Rotunda. They made all of us proud. https://t.co/JoL5MlgGSh
On my way into NYC to @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos to discuss the passing of President Bush 41 and the events of the week in Mueller land. Please watch-it will be a great hour!
Mary Pat &amp; I express our condolences to President Bush 43, Jeb and the entire Bush family on the passing of President Bush 41. He was a great President, a great leader and, most of all, an inspirational AMERICAN. God Bless you Mr. President. America misses you already.
Great season for the Irish. On to the playoffs. Go Irish! #uNDefeated https://t.co/H4Lxql51hX
Mary Pat and I are truly saddened by the passing today of an extraordinary public servant, Jim Harkness. Jim was a great leader, advisor and friend. Our condolences to Jim’s family on their loss. He will be truly missed by all he touched during his generous life.
Very interesting........ https://t.co/lFHaAKyZPZ

Six years ago Superstorm Sandy landed in NJ, battered our citizens and forever changed our landscape. Mary Pat and I still pray for all the victims and their families. To all those who stayed in NJ &amp; helped us rebuild-Thank You! We will always be Stronger than the Storm. #STTS

Getting ready to appear at 7:05am with @GStephanopoulos on @GMA to discuss the Brett Kavanaugh situation. Ready to go!
I applaud the Senate for its passage of bills that adopt many of the recommendations of The President’s Commission on the Opioid Crisis. I ask conference members to adopt House version of the IMD waiver urged by @realDonaldTrump. Nothing will open more treatment beds in the U.S.
Will appear this morning on @GMA with @GStephanopoulos to discuss the latest political and legal news at 7:05am.
Loyal NJ constituents at an ND tailgate. https://t.co/Y1lMDTLaBL
This is especially true when you hear from people like me who he directly quotes in his book that he never fact checked with in any way. https://t.co/43Nig0RFH8
To be clear, a number of the statements attributed to me and from others to me in the Woodward book are incorrect. I would have been happy to correct them if Mr. Woodward or any member of his staff would have called me, as a person they were quoting, for standard fact checking.
If Mr. Woodward would have performed rudimentary journalistic fact checking with those he was quoting, he would have had a more accurate book rather than just being a stenographer for Mr. Bannon's self-aggrandizing revisionist history.
"Unfortunately, it appears Bob Woodward has used  perpetual leaker Steve Bannon as a co-author for his book. His non-stop, self-centered leaking is why Steve was fired from the White House in the first place.
.@bobwoodward_ on Today Show about the “building blocks of journalism”. Seems to me that if you are going to directly quote someone based on another person’s account, least you should do is call quoted person to fact check. Bob Woodward never called me. Is that a building block? https://t.co/R7SCvc3Aif
That would be a talk worth attending for any law student wanting to know how to successfully weave a private law practice and public service into a fascinating career. Thanks for all you do .@JonBramnick https://t.co/PnqNtY52Ln
Getting ready to appear on This Week with @GStephanopoulos after another uneventful week in Washington, DC. Hope you watch!
@nytimes editorial board should never allow an anonymous author to take political shots at any President from inside his administration. “Senior Administration Official” could be any of hundreds of folks. How senior is this person? Reinforces the widespread view of media bias.
Very excited to announce that I will be appearing this year ⁦@Politicon⁩ in Los Angeles. For tickets: https://t.co/Gkc7gVH2gX https://t.co/dJ2VzQnVzz
It has been an honor to get to know @SenJohnMcCain and to be able to call him my friend. At a particularly challenging time in my life, he stood up for me &amp; my character. I will always be indebted to him for that and for the friendship of Cindy as well. What a great American hero
The whole Christie family is proud of you Jack! https://t.co/OGwFZsMuvo
Will be with @GStephanopoulos at 7:05am on Good Morning America to discuss the conviction of Paul Manafort and the guilty pleas of Michael Cohen.
On “This Week” with @GStephanopoulos to discuss Don McGahn, the midterm elections and the Peter Strzok firing. On at 10am in NYC market and 10:30 in Philadelphia market.
72,000 overdose deaths in 2017 just as we predicted. Congress needs to act on the crisis by adopting the 65 recommendations made last year. Thanks to .@realDonaldTrump &amp; @KellyannePolls for adopting our proposals &amp; to the House for passing the bills. Now on to the US Senate ASAP!
Make it happen at the PGA! #Tiger #Believe
Great young men. So proud to have gotten to know them over the last four years. https://t.co/D7OIqvEWZu

I am so excited to be working on a book that will "Let Me Finish". It will be in my voice and with my Jersey style--no punches pulled and no truths hidden. You can pre-order it now on your favorite site so it is in your hands on January 29th! #LetMeFinish https://t.co/GiSdgUbgeb

When I walked at @BeachHouseCntr and interacted with the alumni, I saw  clinical and medical treatment, counseling for stress, self-esteem, mental health, physical aspects, family interventions, pending legal issues, spiritual needs &amp; more. Time to work. https://t.co/QmNjUylFQ1
Proud to have joined board of @BeachHouseCntr as Executive Chairman. When I visited @BeachHouseCntr, I knew they had what’s needed for long-term recovery.  An all-encompassing approach. They will help save lives for those they work with and help families cope with this disease.
Congratulations to Judge Brett Kavanaugh on his nomination by @realDonaldTrump to the United States Supreme Court. He is incredibly well qualified, has great integrity and a long commitment to public service. He is an outstanding choice for the Court and our country.
Tomorrow is a huge day for the Mexico World Cup team as they face Brazil. I believe Juan Carlos Osorio will help his team find a way against Brazil--the same way they did it against Germany. It is Mexico's time.
The NH GOP is very fortunate to have Wayne McDonald to assume the mantle of leadership in another key election year. I know first hand how talented, loyal and hard working Wayne is--he will be a great Chairman for all the Republicans of the great state of New Hampshire! Congrats!
What a fabulous win today for South Korea over an overrated German team in the World Cup. What you truly learn about when the game starts is who can really compete and who is just talk. We learned that today about both South Korea and Germany.
A heartfelt thank you to Justice Anthony Kennedy for 43 years of service to our nation. Now, I am confident that @realDonaldTrump will nominate and the Senate will confirm a constitutional conservative to the U.S. Supreme Court.
A great day for free speech rights of Gov't workers in NJ &amp; around the country--they no longer will pay exorbitant dues for political activities they don't agree with! No mandatory dues for teachers, police officers or state workers. Freedom of choice! Thank you Justice Alito
Great win today by Mexico in the #FIFAWorldCup over a heavily favored German team. Congrats to Coach Juan Carlos Osorio.
The WaPo story tonight saying I have been asked to help prepare @realDonaldTrump for any interview with Bob Mueller is dead wrong. I have not been asked by anyone to do anything of the sort. The story is wrong.
Will be on GMA this morning at 7:10am to discuss the legal issues surrounding the Mueller investigation.
The fake books would be, I thought, a little off putting for an NYT best selling author. But I'll take your word for it. https://t.co/XLQJWJdDqv
Congratulations to Steve and to fellow Blue Hen Ciara on your accomplishment. A great place to go to school. Go Blue Hens! https://t.co/WzoXwPrhul
Today we should all take some time to remember those who served our country in the military, past &amp; present. The sacrifice that they, and members of their families, make on behalf of our nation should never be forgotten. On behalf of my entire family, thank you to all who serve.
Exactly @NDMikeBrey. These five young men acted as big brothers to our daughter .@SarahChristie23 for the last four years. What a great example they all are (including Sarah) as students and athletes. Go Irish! Great day for everyone on May 20 in South Bend. https://t.co/VgqwGBSSKU
Meet the nun Jimmy Kimmel caricatured, writes @wjmcgurn; So agree with Bill McGurn--I urge Jimmy Kimmel to make it up to her by flying Sister Pat out to his show &amp; interview her as an example of what selfless, loving work looks like. Step up Jimmy Kimmel! https://t.co/6FEcgPkXmR
A great day for the rights of states and their people to make their own decisions. New Jersey citizens wanted sports gambling and the federal Gov't had no right to tell them no. The Supreme Court agrees with us today. I am proud to have fought for the rights of the people of NJ.
Great recognition for one of the best Governors in America--@MassGovernor Charlie Baker https://t.co/cuhoSfbwqM
The performance at the WHCD was awful. Her pounding of .@PressSec and .@KellyannePolls was mean spirited and not funny. Pathetic performance.
Thanks to .@FLOTUS for caring so much about this crisis and lending her voice to the fight to save lives in America. https://t.co/geOcBKbwgb
.@PhillySteaks--you have great folks working for all the customers there on a Friday night. https://t.co/WFLMQrxreL
Just made a quick visit to @PhillySteaks to bring some to North Jersey for the family. Thanks to all the folks there for taking care of me and Mary Pat on a Friday night!
A great week of having @FLOTUS on the world stage making us proud and celebrating her birthday too! Happy birthday. https://t.co/MBNYQEM4ju
Take back day is incredibly important to eliminate these drugs for diversion and misuse. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump for getting behind this effort. #takebackday https://t.co/Pbw9sexQgE
@PoliticalStile As for your other typically snarky, non-fact based commentary, I feel bad for you, as I always have, for living such a cynical existence.
@PoliticalStile My criticism of Jim is based on his performance on the HRC email probe. No right to have a presser to announce a prosecutorial decision--that is the job of the AG or the DAG. I respect Jim but he was wrong &amp; he would have fired any of us who did something like that on his watch.
@mattkatz00 I have consistently criticized Jim's performance regarding the Clinton e-mail investigation since his press conference in 2016. Not his conclusion (which I do not have a complete basis to judge) but no FBI supervisor has the right to announce prosecutorial decisions. Not his job.
Once again...a class act https://t.co/E02Wy7Lfpk
Prayers for President Bush 41 from me and Mary Pat. We are sure his heart is heavy and his sorrow profound--it can't help but affect the body. Hopefully prayers from millions of Americans can lift his burdens and his spirits. Get well soon Mr. President.
Mary Pat and I wish the entire Bush family our condolences on the loss of the one and only Barbara Bush. A great First Lady and an even better person. Her conduct was an example to everyone in public life.
I think it’s unfortunately obvious that Jim Comey began to believe his own press clippings. It's the biggest danger in public life. The hubris that he shows in his interview is extraordinary. Not the guy that I worked with or worked for. It is sad for those who worked for Justice
There's a rule at Justice that 60 days before an election you do nothing about somebody who is going to be on the ballot. Comey did it 11 days before. He's the leader? Where was the deputy attorney general to stop him?
What he's proving in his interview is that the president may have been right to fire him.  Don't agree with how it was done, but, in the interview Jim Comey is acknowledging that he took into account politics in making investigative decisions.  And that breaks all the rules.
We're not supposed to care about politics as prosecutors. But what we find out from his interview is that he did. That Jim Comey did care about politics. It is so depressing as somebody who spent seven years in the Justice Department trying to make sure it worked the right way.
When I worked for Jim Comey, if I had told him 11 days before an election that I was releasing information that could effect an election, and the decision was influenced by polling, he would have fired me. He would have fired me on the spot. He is guilty of doing that himself-Wow
Please tune in tomorrow morning to @ThisWeekABC as I give my unvarnished views on Jim Comey and his interview with @GStephanopoulos. See you tomorrow morning.
The nation owes real thanks to Speaker Paul Ryan for stepping up to lead the House and for his honest, forthright leadership. On a personal note, I thank Paul for his friendship and know that he will find real joy at home full-time with his great family. Thank you Paul.
Will be on @GMA this morning with @GStephanopoulos to discuss the implications of the FBI search on the offices of attorney @MichaelCohen212. Tune in at 7am ET.
Today my thoughts are on all that Dr. King meant to our nation and how much we could use his voice today as so many issues regarding race in our country remain unresolved. May this 50th anniversary of his death lead all of us to take some of his spirit into our hearts.
Incredible win for @ndwbb! What guts, what grit, what courage...Go Irish! Congrats to Hall of Famer Muffet McGraw on a special win!
Let's start the year with a big win over a good program https://t.co/Kwtt6c4xNs
It was great fun as a lifelong Mets fan to be at Opening Day and see a big Mets win. It was a true honor to be able to watch the game and speak to the incredible Rachel Robinson, the widow of baseball immortal Jackie Robinson. Thanks to the amazing Rachel Robinson! https://t.co/A0bLo2EyLh
While Opening Day is always a special day, filled with joy and hope and visions of springtime weather--today, Mets fans my age mix in a healthy dose of sadness and mortality as we mourn the passing of Mets great Rusty Staub. Rest in peace Le Grand Orange. https://t.co/Dssbof4PTK

A very tough and unfair night for @NDmbb. They beat Syracuse, at Syracuse, without ND's two best players. They end w/identical records in the ACC. @NDmbb is out and Syracuse is in? Sorry for .@NDMikeBrey and a gritty group of young men. On to the NIT to prove our worth. Go Irish!

Congratulations to Bob Hugin for 19 years of great leadership for @Celgene. From 200 jobs when he began to over 7,500 well paying jobs today, his leadership with his team has helped to cure diseases and create jobs at the same time. America needs more of that kind of leadership.
Congratulations on 24 yrs of exemplary service to our state and the nation @USRepRodney. I am proud to have worked with you and proud to be your constituent. You will be missed by so many who have benefitted from your wise leadership at the county, state and national level.
Great job by the @NDmbb basketball managers. Great job @SarahChristie23! https://t.co/KqvmLe3AYp
Neither option was the way I entered airport as Governor(wrong in the story) and PAPD officer never denied me entry at either place (also wrong in story). He was a gentleman assisting my security detail. When he got the right info he took me to the right place. Pure fiction.(2/2)
Absolutely false story about my travel today. NJSP security detail &amp; I were led to one entrance in the airport by PAPD officer. TSA informed PAPD and NJSP that this was the wrong way to enter and directed us to another entrance where I was screened &amp; admitted to the airport(1/2)
Thank you to all the people of New Jersey for the honor of being your Governor for the last eight years. It was a true privilege.

@rizzoTK State funding has been ramped up significantly--2 1/2 times more than the last 5 administrations combined-$8.8b--the most in history. Additional commitment of the lottery and quarterly payments instead of annual. "Interesting" how you fail to note that ever. No shock from you Sal
My statement on the passing of Governor Brendan T. Byrne: https://t.co/FlwWaMlMlB
It is a shame that Democrats in the Legislature are paralyzed &amp; let the arbitration cap expire. This will lead to higher property taxes &amp; to negative action from ratings agencies. Governors lead. So let me be clear--we need this cap now. Everyone in leadership should be as clear.
Declaring state of emergency in Cape May, Atlantic, Ocean &amp; Monmouth Counties. All state offices will now be closed. Please stay off the roads and stay sheltered and warm.
State offices will have a 2 hour delayed opening from normal start times tomorrow, January 4th to allow for the clearing of roadways in response to tonight’s anticipated winter storm.  Be safe everyone! https://t.co/GueKAS3Y68

I commend A.G. Sessions for selecting Craig Carpenito to be New Jersey's United States Attorney. Craig is an outstanding lawyer &amp; the type of decisive leader the office needs. I am confident he will be a U.S. Attorney that New Jersey will be proud of today and in the years ahead.
Wishing everyone a very happy &amp; healthy New Year!

@PollsterPatrick @Morning_Joe @MonmouthPoll Why care about a poll that deceives recipients by not telling them that its results say NOTHING statistically about Sandy victims statewide?
@PollsterPatrick Except your release says that these statistics cannot be applied to the larger group of all NJ Sandy victims. So the statement is misleading
@MonmouthPoll In last paragraph of his biased release "the survey results cannot be statistically projected to the larger population of all Sandy victims"

I urge all New Jerseyans to remain off the roads so we can safely &amp; efficiently handle all emergency situations. Be safe everyone!
This storm is expected to produce significant snow accumulations, high winds, freezing temps, coastal flooding &amp; whiteout travel conditions.
I have also authorized the closing of state offices on Tuesday, March 14th for all non-essential employees.

We counted every Star-Ledger legal notice ad in every paper in 2016. They had $16.6m from taxpayers. Why are taxpayers being forced to pay?
Star-Ledger boss Richard Vezza says our $16.6m figure for legal notices for S-L is "wrong" but refuses to give his numbers. No transparency.
@MatthewArco Where is reporting on gross misrepresentation by S-L &amp; NJ Press Association about Legal Notices cash? Not allowed? $16.6m in 16
@dracioppi Read the letter--it was not a 30 day analysis. It was a 365 day complete review. Please just try to be thorough &amp; objective

@NJShorePatch Reviewed the actual ads in the papers. They do need to open their books now that they are fighting for Govt millions!
@ChrisMegerian Reviewing the actual ads themselves NOT relying on the billionaire's lobbyists like you are. Can't you ask or not allowed?
@ChrisMegerian We got our numbers right from newspapers themselves btw--as we've said many times. Why not ask news owners? Scared to offend?
@ChrisMegerian Gannett &amp; Newhouse billionaires are taking the subsidy. If we are wrong, open the books &amp; prove it. Or, do your job &amp; ask.
How about reporters doing their homework &amp; asking their billionaire bosses for proof of legal ad revenue? Can't use OPRA; afraid of layoffs?
Reporters blindly defend their billionaire bosses and their $80m subsidy while Gannett lays off their colleagues in Bergen. Open your books.
Documentation for legal ad costs come directly from their papers; where is proof from them we're wrong? Newhouse &amp; Gannett: open your books?
Billionaire Gannett gets tens of millions from taxpayers but won't open books &amp; plan to layoff Bergen county workers. Weinberg sides w/them.
Weinberg, Gordon &amp; Van Drew voted no on billionaire news owner subsidy before--now they're opposed. What did they get to change their minds?
Billionaire newspaper owners demand Gov't subsidy from taxpayers but refuse to open their books to show how much tax $ they already take.
Billionaire newspaper owners unmasked themselves as just another special interest feeding at the Gov't trough. $80m subsidy for billionaires
Read my opinion editorial on posting legal notices online here: https://t.co/OOA4XamRS1
I just published “A Message From Governor Chris Christie On Posting Legal Notices Online” https://t.co/Ic7fpNeHYv
Sens. Weinberg &amp; Gordon "revenge" on taxpayers? Force them to pay $80m a yr to newspapers rather than free posts on the web. Need tax relief
Sens. Weinberg and Gordon would rather have citizens pay $80m per year for paper ads than post for free on the web? Welcome to the 21st cent
Sen Gordon says "online advertising" could cost more than papers? Please explain to him towns don't pay for posting on their own website!
Sen Weinberg says "online advertising" could cost more? Someone explain to her that towns don't have to pay to post on their own websites!
John Wisniewski 2004 vote on A-2988 to allow Internet posting of legal notices? A big YES on 6/17/04! Today flip flops. Why John? Hypocrisy
Sen Gordon 2004 vote on A-2988 to allow Internet posting of legal notices? A big YES on 6/17/04! Today he flip flops. Why Senator? Hypocrisy
Sen Weinberg 2004 vote on A-2988 to allow Internet posting of legal notices? A big YES on 6/17/04! Today? She flip flops. Why Senator?
Sen Gordon against bill for legal notices on the web rather than big taxpayer $ to papers. He voted FOR very same bill in 2004! Wow!
@JohnWisniewski against bill for legal notices on the web rather than big taxpayer $ to papers. He voted FOR very same bill in 2004! Wow!
Sen Gordon against bill for legal notices on the web rather than big taxpayer $ to papers. She voted FOR very same bill in 2004! Wow!

Post the bill Mr. Speaker -  the time is NOW. https://t.co/SHcMaDJuaX
.@VincentPrieto‘s obstruction will cause insolvency in AC &amp; have ripple effects across NJ. It’s irresponsible. https://t.co/BX0bR8Emr4
Post the bill Mr. Speaker. https://t.co/BX0bR8Emr4
.@VincentPrieto should put the interests of AC, its people &amp; the credit worthiness of the state of NJ first. https://t.co/BX0bR8VXPE
I am not going to stand by and watch this happen. Not on my watch. https://t.co/ZL6JwFPjwW
.@VincentPrieto doesn’t object to the state taking over responsibility - just don’t hurt his political friends. https://t.co/ZL6JwFPjwW
The clock is ticking @VincentPrieto and the people of AC and Atlantic County deserve better. https://t.co/ZL6JwFPjwW
I hope @VincentPrieto steps up to his responsibility in the next 24 hours. Do your job and post the bill. https://t.co/BX0bR8Emr4
It is not @VincentPrieto's right to be a one man obstruction crew &amp; cause insolvency in AC.  https://t.co/BX0bR8Emr4
Post the bill Mr. Speaker. https://t.co/BX0bR8Emr4
There’s a voting session tomorrow. @VincentPrieto needs to put the interest of AC &amp; its people in the forefront https://t.co/BX0bR8VXPE
Coming up:  My press conference with Atlantic County Executive Dennis Levinson, live from AC here:  https://t.co/EojaVBFwJi
NJ's been a national leader on the issue of lead paint in housing &amp; the resulting decline in cases proves that point https://t.co/HsHobdwEGD
This effort will operate in addition to the many anti-lead programs already in place in NJ. https://t.co/H0Z1eppwCT
Today, I’ve announced an additional $10 million to support an improved lead remediation &amp; containment program. https://t.co/HsHobdf3P5
Press conference from my outer office in Trenton coming up shortly at:  https://t.co/EojaVBFwJi
.@VincentPrieto stop playing politics &amp; post the bills. ICYMI: Analysts: AC's troubles could hurt other N.J. cities https://t.co/9NFnE7CoJd
Today, DOE has filed a lawsuit to protect the property tax collections that rightfully belong to the AC school district and their students.
I urge @VincentPrieto to do his job and post the bill for the voting session on Thursday. https://t.co/9HYGxPcSPP
The irresponsible actions of @VincentPrieto are putting at risk one of America’s great historical cities. https://t.co/9HYGxPcSPP
Mayor Guardian’s plan for AC is not a solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a hemorrhaging wound. https://t.co/9HYGxPcSPP
.@VincentPrieto stands with public sector unions. This administration stands with the taxpayers of AC &amp; NJ https://t.co/D40K5dLzNU
He chooses union contracts over AC’s schoolchildren and bondholders because lifeguards need their pensions https://t.co/D40K5dLzNU
There’s nothing more important to @VincentPrieto than rich public sector union contracts. https://t.co/D40K5e3bcu

The current set of laws does not give me the authority to fix the problems in Atlantic City. https://t.co/b9nkQryiqb
.@VincentPrieto says I’m not using this authority that I supposedly have. I cannot do anything without a takeover. https://t.co/b9nkQryiqb
The idea that this can magically be resolved by the PILOT bill alone is wrong. It’s a fairy tale &amp; they know it. https://t.co/b9nkQryiqb
These are the numbers, this is the math, and these are the facts, and there is no debate about this:  https://t.co/b9nkQrPTOL
Atlantic City’s Cash Crisis is here to stay if @VincentPrieto refuses to act.  https://t.co/0ud8Ha3x98

NJ’s unemployment rate is 0.6 points below the national rate &amp; the number of people working in NJ has reached an all-time high.
Our pro-growth policies of business tax cuts, refusing to raise taxes, &amp; controlling state spending have spurred NJ’s economy.
UPS’ decision to expand here is another clear sign of the economic progress made under this administration. https://t.co/NCj7MG6Mm6

Every family in NJ has been touched by addiction, we have all felt it &amp; seen it. No one is above this problem. https://t.co/lR5oc1lYDt
In order to lower the stigma of addiction we need people from every neighborhood to say it happens in our families https://t.co/lR5oc1lYDt
Continuing the conversation yesterday with Jim McGreevey to ensure those struggling with addiction get a 2nd chance. https://t.co/lR5oc14nLV
Ask @VincentPrieto yourself: https://t.co/925s3h731h
He's going to have to explain to the people of AC &amp; Atlantic County why they’re allowing that city to go into crisis https://t.co/9r9feDcNMI
If Speaker Prieto wants to play politics that is his prerogative. I am not going to participate in that game. https://t.co/9r9feDcNMI
.@AeroFarms could have located in another state, but chose NJ to create the world’s largest aeroponic farm. https://t.co/9vG9O2lHb8

ICYMI:  My interview this morning with @HarryHurley about AC on @WPG1450 Talk Radio.  https://t.co/I3Jdryi93M
I am not opening the treasury of the state of NJ to a city that cannot manage its affairs responsibly.  https://t.co/1QosWOMIqE
If he doesn’t, that means AC runs out of money, and the blame for that goes to @VincentPrieto exclusively. https://t.co/1QosWOMIqE
.@VincentPrieto is playing special interest politics and refuses to act on the AC bills. https://t.co/1QosWOMIqE
Those bills will end AC’s cash crisis and give the state all the tools we need to fix the City’s finances altogether.
We’ve reached a bipartisan agreement with the Senate on two bills for AC. A pilot bill to stabilize the property tax base &amp; a takeover bill.
I’m not going to permit the people of NJ to be held responsible and have their pocketbooks picked again by AC. https://t.co/1QosWOMIqE
The Atlantic City government costs 2 - 3 times more to operate than any other municipal government in this state. https://t.co/1QosWP4jPe

This is our job - 62 hospitals in these communities need to know with certainty what their costs are going to be. https://t.co/uRZ1iuX8os
Today I announced a solution that will end uncertainty on property tax exemption for NJ’s community hospitals.  https://t.co/uRZ1iuX8os
CT raised taxes over &amp; over while NJ said no to tax increases. CT unemployment is a full point higher than NJ.  https://t.co/4V370Gy1fJ
This is a result of the policies we’ve put forward along with the hard work of the employers &amp; people of this state. https://t.co/4V370Gy1fJ
It is not coincidental that NJ unemployment is lower than the national rate and lower than every state in the region https://t.co/4V370Gy1fJ
I will continue to say no to higher taxes every day that I am governor. https://t.co/4V370Ggqob
Even our most strident political opponents are going to have to finally admit that our policies have worked. https://t.co/gIley3SeSR
This is another example of how our policies &amp; fighting tax increases allows NJ to be competitive &amp; creates jobs.  https://t.co/gIley3AE1j

The health, welfare, security &amp; success of the other 8.1 million in NJ would become a second class concern.  https://t.co/sCuAGR9srC
Pensions would be put before all other concerns: education, healthcare, infrastructure, care for those in need, etc. https://t.co/sCuAGR9srC
The pursuit of a constitutional amendment to guarantee pension payments is the road to ruin. #BudgetFY2017  https://t.co/sCuAGR9srC

Camden used to be one of the most dangerous cities in America, but we’ve really had a renaissance there.   https://t.co/gSKkWjT0nQ
I said this to @JakeTapper &amp; for many years now: Camden is a great example of what can be done across this country.  https://t.co/gSKkWjT0nQ
This was possible b/c of the leadership and commitment of Mayor @DanaRedd &amp; @camdencountryPD  https://t.co/yNAcxrt7CM
There has also been a 28% reduction in aggravated assaults, 36% overall drop in violent crime, and 37% reduction in non-violent crime.
Since NJ's partnership w/Camden began in 2013, there's been a 50% reduction in homicides, 35% reduction in rape, 49% reduction in Robberies.
For Camden, it doesn't matter what party you're from. The fact is that u see a city full of both struggle&amp;potential. https://t.co/YvBou8hoLT

I'm asking everyone to drive slowly but speed restrictions are in place. 45 mph for the NJTurnpike and 35 mph on the Garden State Parkway.
The snow is intensifying and as temperatures drop, road conditions are expected to worsen. So if you can stay off the roads tonight, pls do.
Anyone headed home from work and on the roads right now, drive slowly. NJDOT has 1,250 trucks plowing&amp;spreading salt to keep up w/ the storm

So, here's what we've got: NJDOT has more than 1,100 trucks on state highways working to keep roads clear and safe.

Thank you to those who came out today. Today marks my 130th town hall and one of my very 1st town halls was also right here in Somerville.

The fact is we need to do more. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
Nobody wanted to hear that then because they were exhausted from having done the first part. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
I said in 2011 it was a great job done by the Administration &amp; Legislature, but I also said we'll need to do more. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
And here is a full list of accomplishments we have made since then. http://t.co/2ZwT01uptm
In 2011, we passed the first round of pension and health benefit reform. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
They kicked the can further and further down the road and now we sit where we sit where we are because of it today. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
Some of that is just by borrowing more money and worrying about paying it off in the future.  https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
Administrations long before I got here made promises they couldn't keep and did not pay for. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
It was monumental. And at the time, it wasn't being done in the rest of the country. https://t.co/KetfAhtmRC
In 2011 we put in place 4 significant reforms that will save about 120 billion for NJ tax payers over the next 30yrs https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
State of Emergency remains in effect so please do not drive and stay home tonight if you can.
Please keep your distance if you see a plow or salt truck.
NJDOT continues to have more than 2,500 plows and salt trucks on the road trying to keep up with this storm.
Speed restrictions of 35mph on both the Garden State Parkway and the NJ Turnpike are still in effect.
Obviously, the storm got progressively worse today. If you had to go to work today, please be careful on the drive home.
I have ordered all State offices to be closed today for all non-essential employees.
If you have to be out - please drive slow and give plows and spreaders room to work.
There is a state of emergency in place - So if you do not need to be out, please stay off the roads and stay home.
NJDOT is fully activated with more than 2,300 plows and salt spreaders on our highways working to keep the roads clear today.
But no matter what they say, we cannot TAX our way out of this. https://t.co/1qaRc1rst5
For years, previous Administrations made promises they couldn't keep. And now we have to clean up the mess. https://t.co/KetfAhbM04
Want to hear something even more outrageous than yet another snow storm coming our way? https://t.co/iyiHueppBl
Staying off the roads will allow our first responders and public safety officials to be able to safely respond to any emergency situations.
Im asking everyone in New Jersey to please drive carefully and remain off the roads if possible tonight.
My Administration will continue monitoring conditions throughout the remainder of the storm.
Therefore, I've authorized state officials to take all necessary action to prepare.
Tonight's storm is expected to produce travel hazards and potentially cause power outages throughout the state.
In preparation for tonight's storm, I am declaring a State of Emergency here in New Jersey.
ICYMI:  "NJ can't wait on reforming public-sector benefits"  http://t.co/q6Rcorsrdh

Road conditions can change quickly, and freezing rain creates a greater risk of black ice. So, I cannot stress this enough: Drive Slow!
Our crews were activated this afternoon and are out making sure state highways are clear and safe for the evening commute.
NJDOT crews in north and central Jersey pre-treated roads with brine where necessary in advance of the storm.
NJDOT crews and contractors have been working hard throughout a difficult winter and are ready for this storm.
Find out what I'm talking about at our 129th Town Hall this Wednesday at 11am at the Fair Lawn Recreation Center. #ForOurFuture

Drivers be aware speed restrictions are in place.  It is 35mph for the entire length of the GSP and 35mph for most of the NJTurnpike.
So if you can stay home and off the roads tonight, please do. If you absolutely need to drive, drive slow.
The snow is expected to stop later tonight but as it gets darker, the temperature is expected to drop and black ice could develop.
But there is freezing rain south of 195, and snow continues to fall in North Jersey.
There are more than 1900 NJDOT &amp; contractor plows and salt spreaders working to keep state highways clear and safe.

Coming together. Thinking differently. Fighting for all the people. Addressing the long-term.  This is how we get things done. #ForOurFuture
This is the type of leadership our state requires.
I am here today to ask you to do what may be politically difficult, but what is morally the right thing to do.
This is the cost of pushing this off to somebody else. There is no one else. There is no one else but us.
This is the cost of inaction. This is the cost of doing nothing.
…by providing tax relief and new jobs which lead to fulfilling careers.
We will miss the opportunity to boost take home pay for working class taxpayers…
…to become valued and contributing members of the community…
We miss the opportunity to give a 2nd chance to those battling drug addiction or reentering society from prison…
We will miss the opportunity to give our young children the chance to be successful with a quality education no matter where they live…
Every increase in dollars devoted to pension &amp; health benefits is a decrease in dollars invested in other priorities.
Sometimes it doesn’t seem immediately apparent, but this problem is eating us away little by little.
That someone else will pay.  You know that is not true.
They will tell you that it won’t impact you, and that it’s going to be somebody else’s problem.
But we cannot tax our way out of this problem. #ForOurFuture http://t.co/eSKdlXlABL
They will tell you that this will just go away if we ignore it.  They will tell you that this is solvable if we just raise takes.
There are politicians, some of whom may be in this very room, who will tell you that we don’t need further pension and health benefit reform
No one branch of government can wish or order this problem away. We must do it together.
We now have a bipartisan reform plan which can, once and for all, fix this problem.
We acted in 2011 to acknowledge and to begin to repair this serious problem.
I have stood behind this podium for five years speaking about this problem candidly and openly.
The numbers do not lie and we don’t need any court to tell us we have a serious problem.
I don’t come here today just to identify the problem, shrug my shoulders and return to business as usual.
Today we are making the largest state pension payment in NJ history - $1.3 billion. #ForOurFuture

Snowy conditions mean speed restrictions. For entire length of Garden State Parkway it is 45mph and for the NJ Turnpike it is 35mph.
Here is a list of closings and delays from @News12NJ http://t.co/LP5l3PsiQX
On the Garden State Parkway it is 35 mph from southern terminus in Cape May to Exit 143 and 45 mph from Exit 143 to NY State line.
Speed restrictions are in effect. For NJ Turnpike - Its 35 mph from Delaware Memorial Bridge to Exit 11 and 45 mph from Exit 11 to GWB.
In extreme cold, salt maybe less effective. So please use extreme caution when driving. If you can stay off roads this AM, please do.
The heaviest snow is in South Jersey today, but I am asking everyone in our state to drive with caution.
NJDOT has more than 2,500 plows and salt spreaders that have been working overnight to clear state highways.

585 lives have already been saved through overdose reversals w/ Narcan. This law will help us prevent more tragedies &amp; save even more lives.
I also signed an expansion of the Overdose Protection Act to put in law protections for 1stResponders who are saving lives w/ Narcan program
The Pet Purchase Protection Act also bans pet sales from breeders who violate our cruelty laws.
I just signed into law the Pet Purchase Protection Act. This requires better info from pet shops so that sick pets don't end up in NJ homes

We need to address this anxiety head on. We need to renew the spirit and the hopes of our state, our country and our people. #NJSOTS2015
As I traveled the country over the last year, this anxiety was the most palpable emotion I saw and felt. #NJSOTS2015
And this culture of divisiveness and distrust has seeped into our communities and our neighborhoods. #NJSOTS2015
During this time of uncertainty it seems our leaders in Washington would rather stoke division for their own political gain. #NJSOTS2015

.@GovWalker don’t worry… there are enough awkward hugs to go around. http://t.co/gFTItWqPVO
Road conditions can change quickly. It is important to take it slow &amp; leave plenty of distance between you &amp; the vehicle in front of you.
The Garden State Parkway now has a speed restriction of 45 mph from its southern terminus in Cape May to Exit 38/Atlantic City Expressway.
The NJ Turnpike now has a speed restriction of 45 mph from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to Exit 9 in New Brunswick.
Crews will patrol and monitor road conditions throughout the day and spread salt as necessary.
NJDOT crews pre-treated state highways with brine yesterday and applied salt early this morning in advance of any snow.
In parts of the state there are snow flurries but there are no weather issues on any state roads at this time.

This is a mistake and a missed opportunity.
In the last few years, the leadership of the United States government has not always placed sufficient priority on North America.
It is time to get this done.
As I said earlier, a key goal in the U.S.-Canada relationship should be getting stuff done that is in our mutual interest.
and creating jobs, growth and opportunity for all.
And the principles should be enhancing the economic competitiveness of North America, treating allies with respect and fair consideration
Our leaders’ comments on this topic should not be marked by parochialism, but by principles.
This is not about sending “your oil” across “our land”.  It’s about maximizing the benefits of North America’s natural resources for all,.
Secondly, this is no way to treat a friend.
Keystone has now languished for way too long.  And I think this sends a very unfortunate signal.
The State Department’s own environmental impact study concluded that they are safe, and Keystone would be safe.
My view is that we are missing an enormous opportunity when we delay its development.
That brings us, of course, to the major debate on the Keystone XL pipeline.
It shouldn't be that controversial.  In the United States, we already have over 2.2 million miles of pipelines.
The North American energy renaissance has made us all better off, from multiple perspectives – economically, strategically, &amp;environmentally
Canada is the United States’ largest and most reliable supplier of energy.
In no area are the benefits of adopting that “roll up our sleeves and do the hard work” more clearly significant than in the area of energy.

There are no travel restrictions at this time but I urge everyone traveling on the roads 4 Thanksgiving to please be careful while driving.
As a precaution, I am ordering a state of emergency here in New Jersey.
The weather will most likely hinder Thanksgiving travel and potentially causing power outages. #Cato
This nor'easter #Cato is difficult to forecast, significant rain and snowfall is expected throughout the state.
ha! great reference RT @Solameanie: @GovChristie If Cato is attacking, where is Inspector Clouseau to fend him off?
Thx Rev. Stop by NJ sometime! RT @rev_ronvega: @GovChristie I think you're awesome. Wish I could meet you. Keep up the great work. God Bless

There are 1100 NJDOT and contractor trucks deployed statewide. Spreaders are on the road in North Jersey. #Cato

Drivers should take it slow, leave plenty of distance between you and the car in front of you.
It’s important to remember that road conditions can change quickly.
Crews reported overnight and are spreading as necessary in the North and Central parts of the state.
However, should conditions change, our NJDOT crews are ready to keep the roads clear and safe.
We don’t have any weather issues on state highways in NJ at this time and don’t expect any through the morning commute.

@bstevewhite You are dead wrong. Our policy has not changed one inch. Nor will it.
@J73Jim The tent was inside the hospital. Please get your facts straight.
This is a non partisan issue. #Ebola @TODAYshow
This is common sense and members of the American public know this is common sense.
Governors ultimately have the responsibility to protect health and well being of the people within their borders.

I can't imagine that any one would want to spend 3 days in a hospital. But the fact is, she was in contact w/ victims of Ebola...
Coming up next on the @TODAYshow
Ill be on @TODAYshow tomorrow live with @MLauer at 7am
And today, she’s on her way home back to Maine where she will complete 21 day quarantine in her home. https://t.co/8OhfjVEf8i
We waited 24 hrs until she had no further symptoms. https://t.co/8OhfjVEf8i
CDC thought it was a serious enough situation that they ordered an Ebola test. The test came back. It was negative. https://t.co/8OhfjVEf8i
As happened with this nurse from Maine, she was symptomatic. She had a fever. She was sent to University Hospital. https://t.co/8OhfjVEf8i
IF u r symptomatic, you'll be quarantined in a hospital in NJ until we can find out whether u have the virus or not. https://t.co/8OhfjVEf8i

I know she didn't want to be there. No one ever wants to be in the hospital, I suspect. https://t.co/4NdrKvUAT0 #Ebola
Now in this instance it wasn't possible because given her condition at the time.  https://t.co/4NdrKvUAT0 #Ebola
Our preference always is to have people quarantined in their homes. https://t.co/4NdrKvUAT0 #Ebola
You worry about doing what’s right for the people you represent and that’s what we've done.   https://t.co/4NdrKvUAT0 #Ebola

Also to people in public office, we need to be responsible and cautious when talking about Ebola. It's not helpful to add to the hysteria.
It's important that all parents listen and also talk to their kids about Ebola and calm their nerves. #Ebola
Unfortunately, the coverage in the media is reaching our children. Mary Pat and I had to assure our kids, they are not at risk. #Ebola
