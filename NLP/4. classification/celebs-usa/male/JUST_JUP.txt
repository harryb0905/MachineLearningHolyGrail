Bittersweet day for me. So happy to get the chance to play with my brother in Atlanta but will miss the city and the fans here in Phoenix.
“@ShaneVictorino: Good times today fellas... @Giancarlo818 @JUS10UP10 @Evan3Longoria @DatDudeBP #Stuntin in our red hats lol” Great time!

Appreciate the support. This is the view from my hotel room. Going to enjoy it and not worry about this trade nonsense http://t.co/LWxs5tWo
@DHuddy41 I still can't believe you drove

@_DrewBrown my game is really tacky right now, I have to get some practice in first
@halladayfan32 yeah, it's about that time, I'm getting the itch
“@TmJ_8: @JUS10UP10 you on FIFA 13??” I've been traveling a ton, haven't played much, my game is suffering.
@TimTwilson Merry Christmas to The Wilson's!

@CY24_7 I know pops is happy! You can see it on his face! Good stuff playboy

I'm going to disappear again to catch up on the last two weeks of homeland before Sunday.
“@KenArnold1984: @JUS10UP10 When it's a birthday? Nope. Can I get one for my special day today? 28 years old now.” This one seems logical...
Retweeting people's tweets asking me to retweet seems weird to me...am I wrong?
@ETown302 that's pretty sick that u have a baby jaguar lol
“@ASUPolarBear: @JUS10UP10 Tweeting is tough. You have to be committed to it” I'm having some twitter commitment issues lol
Nobody else thinks tweeting is tough? #lackoftalent
@LGJ3630 lol, I don't have that much to say.
I am not tweeting while driving, this all hit me when it took me longer than usual to get home.
All I ask is for people to drive the speed limit. The tires on the car are made to survive rain. #promise
@CBake93 orange bowl
I get it! I'm done with my English class now.
@gtosports good call
It's like the drivers go into shock that there's rain coming out of the ski
@bigmetsfan123 never thought of that, I'd ponder it. That's pretty clever
I love driving behind People in AZ when it's raining. Makes for a slow ride.
@CY24_7 I just know you down there in The H wit all that good food, and you eatin everything!
“@CY24_7: Food poisoning = not tight!!  👎👎. Looks like I'll just be studying video today.”Stop eating everything in sight.
@Wally_Zee @shane0gee sorry to inform you but that's not my license plate, and I would never have that license plate lol
@AliGator10 @latroyhawkins32 @ballystar40 @rsm_dillon there goes that losing mentality of the gators. Bragging about being 4th best.
@AliGator10 you can't fault a man for paying his debts...with that said, what kind of person actually purchases a snuggie? #dork
@SegalSegal14 go look in the mirror and be honest with yourself
@AliGator10 big game today...I think you should change you handle to AliLoser10 after the game today #justsayin
@RSM_DILLON tell Allison I like my #Gator fried

@wademiley36 @c_johnson28 I agree, get back in the stand, because I still don't have any jerky...
@CaseyC6 yeah, of course. He was one of our clubhouse leaders!
@VictusSports haha, haven't picked up a bat since October 3rd
Waiting for @CY24_7 to get to Norfolk, sounds about right. Me waiting on him.
@AshleeTarbutton I'm glad you liked the egraph! It was the first one I've ever done! Thanks for coming out and supporting us!
@nickgagliano if @CY24_7 was here you'd be paying double, so you are definitely lucking out
@nickgagliano i don't get paid to play golf. Good chance you cover my gas for the ride home though.
@nickgagliano you can't talk trash to someone who has to give you strokes...
In honor of BJ and I hitting our 100th HRs on the same day, here are some pics of us together http://t.co/67B8fy1f #Fantapper

@DHuddy41 just remember, you don't pitch for anybody but the other 24 guys in that clubhouse. Our opinion is all that matters.
“@sportsRlife9870: @JUS10UP10 Im a huge fan could i get a RT for my 18th birthday? That would be awesome!” Happy 18th B-Day!
Check out some cool pics! http://t.co/67BcN829 #Tapit
Tito was a great manager and Orel was a great pitcher, I just don't understand why they can't call the game the way it is.
I haven't turned on ESPN after a game in two years, #MLBNetwork actually works hard at voicing the details of a game. That's what I watch.
I'm laughing to myself that nobody else notices that these guys just talk nonsense toward the game as if they've never seen a game before
@NotTheFakeKyleM he got the bad genes lol
And when you're on second base with no outs your job is to tag on a fly ball and make sure you can advance to third base #ESPN
For the kids out there, when your coach gives you the safety squeeze you don't have to bunt the ball if its not a strike.
Amazing that my brother has made two good baseball plays tonight and the #ESPN so called analysts have bashed him for both of them.
Ok, we are good now. Let's not make these guys feel too special. Lol #dbackfanshaveclass
@Henn_BaB_03 Happy Birthday
@AZSportsDude that's gonna be tough.
My fellow #playboys did some serious damage tonight! @CY24_7 got the party crackin early! And @RRoberts14 closed the curtains! Great Win!

This #Duke #UNC game is the most exciting blowout I've watched in awhile.
We sent out the hit party invitation, you just left it over at Talking Stick. We'll make sure to put it in your travel bag next time.
And I can't forget #playboy @CY24_7 he got his first #mollywhop of the season!
@RRoberts14 with his first #mollywhop of the season. Good to see the little man didn't lose his pop. I was worried.
@DHern_30 this is coming from the guy who was scared to play?
I would like to think my followers wouldn't turn their back on me for the @CY24_7 bandwagon.
@CY24_7 seems desperate.
@CY24_7 is quite right now, he must be plotting.
@CY24_7 you started the hating! But we can go if you wanna go!

“@skinnyswag9: Man I smelled fresh pine tar today while we were hitting it must be almost baseball season!!! #LetsGetIt” I love that smell..
@sandovalsteve Runkel is the new slimy guy. But Hank was better at it
“@thetruejordan: @JUS10UP10 you think it's a bad season?  It is lacking the classic Hank Moody touch” Exactly, we need scumbag hank to show
@sandovalsteve Rza has been a funny addition, but something exciting needs to happen soon.
“@J_Palmer27: @JUS10UP10 I'm goin in for my 2nd back procedure in 2 months in the morning. Can I get a good luck or something?”good luck bro
@tracytravel I just haven't caught up on shameless, I need to so I can watch the new season.
Californication better step it up this season, I'm on edge with it.
Adele is ridiculously good at what she does. She sung that song with ease, and it sounded amazing. Wow.
@DerekMiles17 that's great news. Keep working hard. Good things will come.
@EJ36  @nickgagliano  I'd pay to see Eddie on the golf course!
@nickgagliano embarrassed myself beyond belief. You MIGHT have beat me today.
@DBacksDad I like track 9 better.
@CY24_7 P.F. Changs sounds unbelievable right now.
@AMart4343 ole Amarty Mart! What's really hood?
This is the National Championship game?
Ok, I'm done giving Chipotle free advertising. This is ridiculous what we were just doing. #done
@BueWho Colorado. Close enough lol
@CbakeSwag I've dumped enough money in their pockets to have partial ownership. #addicted
“@bobstroup: @jus10up10 Stone Cold Creamery doesn't have ads” Dont disrespect "Cold Stone" like that haha, they are pretty good too.
@BrentOrozco they are doing just fine haha
@JLBurnfin I love Qdoba queso!
I have never seen a chipotle commercial bc they don't exist. Yet, everyone on earth eats it. #impressive
“@BrentOrozco: @JUS10UP10 had the same thing! chicken bowl. bangin” #ditto
@chichela burrito bowl, everytime.
Chipotle for dinner. Amazing.
You guys are awesome! I'm pumped about being in Chase Field again, balling infront of my #dbacks fans!!

“@gsandhu92: @JUS10UP10 I'm a Broncos fan and I don't like to give all the credit to Tebow. It takes the entire team to win” #genius
“@Jo_Mar4: @JUS10UP10 wassup with the haters though ? it's just a football game lol” wow, I'm glad somebody realizes that. #alreadyoverit
I'm just retweeting the cool people who run their mouth for my entertainment. I'm glad all my fans are having fun with it too!!
You #tebowriders went from riding him to bashing #bigben when the game got close. #unbelievable
Did anyone else see that stat?!? 25 career game-winning drives. #bigbentime
Thats the #tebow I like to see!
#BigBen has been orchestrating 4th quarter comebacks a lot longer than #tebow. For you #tebow fans.
#uh oh
What's funny is that I'm rooting for the steelers and the haters are brown-nosing #tebow , for the record, I don't dislike #tebow.
These refs don't know what a hold is against the #Steelers
@arkema15 don't live in the past, it's not good for you mentally.
#blackandyellow let's go
“@blackdomm: @JUS10UP10 u from VA and root for PITT?” who do you expect me to root for? The #redskins? Yeah right
My #Steelers will pick it up in the second half. We need a few halftime adjustments.
This is embarrassing.
Wow, if James harrison would've made that last hit on Wallace he would've gotten flagged for 15 yrds
@TheeAlexander22 deal!!
@TheeAlexander22 @barryenright54 you don't honestly believe that
Congrats to all the winners, apparently I'm a bad gambler! I bet against @CY24_7 with his team, maybe he'll bet against my steelers tomorrow
#gameover foster is a beast, I'm signing baseballs right now.
“@CY24_7: Dang, my #shirtisweak RT @SunsJD3fan: @CY24_7 @JUS10UP10 what you guys think of my pic! :)” SO WEAK #playboy

@FrankieSox that would be perfect but @CY24_7 has smaller feet
@SunsJD3fan yeah, I'm taking cincy over the texans
What should I wager with @CY24_7 for the Cincy v Houston game?
@CY24_7 what you wanna put on it?!?
@CY24_7 Playboy!
@VENTIL8 yeah I live here. I'm not a big sleeper in the offseason, but I can't help it during the season bc of our schedule
@ATrace48 I'd like to think its gonna be Steelers v Packers
@VENTIL8 I've been up since 8:15
@ac_caldera09 I got my Steelers winning eventhough try are pretty banged up.
@bashbrothers09 I grew up a Steeler fan, but I support the Cards too.
@J_Smooth263 New Orleans and Cincy is gonna surprise the Texans.
@morganfox19 I'd like to think I'd be a professional golfer!
Early start for me this morning, I guess I'll eat some breakfast and wait for some good football games! #NFLPlayoffs
Bedtime.
@AngieFontes that's all that matters.
@AngieFontes I'm glad you enjoy watching me and my teammates and that we bring you happiness. Enjoy the people closest to you.
@iainsut my hand eye coordination is good for one thing, hitting a baseball.
@AdamHill32 yeah, that was sick! You won't see that again for awhile!
I dont play any call of duty, I can't play those games, way too hard.
Taking a mental break from FIFA. Gotta regroup from those poundings I took.
But I'm down for continuing to strut my terrible FIFA skills.
I just realized I'm awful at this game.
@matthouston91 maybe I shouldn't play you guys that was bad
I'm getting embarrassed right now.
Apparently in picking the wrong people. Haven't gotten a game yet.
Who's actually online, this is getting irritating lol?
@TreVonJohnson10 #firstvictim
@TreVonJohnson10 you on right now?
I play in 360, I'll get to everybody at some point. Send me gamer tags!
@TreVonJohnson10 yup
Who wants to play FIFA?

@BarryEnright54" @DHuddy41 #tiredgame"
@BarryEnright54 I don't think he would talk trash and not back it up.
@TheeAlexander22 me and you versus @BarryEnright54 and @DHuddy41 next week
I don't know which name I like better #GingerWoods or #TheGingerbeardMan I think IPK might have @BarryEnright54 beat
I can't wait to play golf with @BarryEnright54 it's such an honor to play with someone of his caliber. #GingerWoods
@BarryEnright54 we forgot you should be on tour. You and tiger play practice rounds together and you beat him. Lol
@EYJr I ain't been doing much, workin out and traveling, you?
@D_Train35 I was out at the stadium gettin that foot down today! Bad thing is that I looked like Rodrigo Lopez tryin to hit Aroldis Chapman.
@LPnAZ480 everybody knows that Iowa sucks, that should feel like a comedy session!
About to workout at the stadium, unfortunately I have to hear @BarryEnright54 and @DHuddy41 talk more trash about golf. #pitchersgolftoomuch
@BillHall_III I keep my wallet, just let me know.
@BillHall_III doesn't matter, whatever I finished at would beat you all day.
@phxsteeler monument
@BillHall_III lol, the sun went down on us at the 17th fairway. I was at 88 then haha

@HEADZUPJUICE I'm chillen out in AZ, traveling too much. What's good?
@DHuddy41 I got confidence in my boy @CY24_7 we can handle you unathletic scrubs!
As expected @nickgagliano got smoked on the course! I won by 12 strokes, but who's counting. A win is a win.
@BrandonSnyder29 you coming out the wood works with your tired golf game?
@CY24_7 you have the belt right now bc you ran off to Houston like a little girl as soon as you got a lead.
@CY24_7 @billhall_iii y'all are the worst. I can't believe you are on twitter lying to your fans already.
@CY24_7 I'm in AZ whenever you ready!
About to go have an A$$ whipping party against @nickgagliano on the golf course, wish @CY24_7 was here so he could recieve one too!
Id like to Congratulate my boy @CY24_7 aka Chris Young on finally getting a twitter! Show him some love!

@D_Train35 what you look like on a ski slope? #ComeOnMan
“@EasyE_33: @realjustinupton where did you stay in the Bahamas?”The Cove at the Atlantis, awesome resort. I really enjoyed it.
@NNNNate Jason Kubel is a very good player, and I think he can help us in a lot of ways. He's a big bat, that can supply some power for us.

@BigJuanCarlo94 I have to go with my #Steelers all the way, but I'm biased.
@LJwildcat you call yourself rubbing that nice weather in my face huh?
“@rowdybusch1818: @realjustinupton @barryenright54 football is soccer there”shall we spell it futbol?
@BarryEnright54 Can you watch football in #Venezuela? I thought they only watched soccer and baseball over there.
@kroyboy27 I don't know, if everybody make everyday as fun as today, my twitter future looks bright I guess
“@April_Mc_13: @realjustinupton Or score at all.”Good point!
Good thing I have the Eagles Defense in my fantasy league, bc it looks like the Cowboys don't wanna score much today.
NBC should turn this game off continue their regularly scheduled program.
"@JarrodBParker: Watching @SHO_Dexter #NewEpisode"That show is sick, I'm still tryin to catch up and watch the new season!
I would say something about someone throwing another TD pass, but  the negativity might be overwhelming.
No blocking going on I respect all opinions.
Wow, let me stop tweeting about a good football player because people can't just talk football. P.S. I have a dog. #PeopleAreSoSensitive
@crezdfdub wow, tell the world how you really feel.
@MikeVick read that blitz like a Dr. Seuss book.
@MitchMox7 make sure you sit in right field and tell everyone else to stop booing too!
“@JntteRO: @realjustinupton can I get a happy birthday ? (:”happy birthday Jeanette!! Hope it was an awesome day!"
@TylerSkaggs23 Let me Ponnnnder that...I take my #Steelers any day of the week.
I have to pull for my fellow VA boy @MikeVick
