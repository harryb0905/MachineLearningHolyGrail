Anyway that was my first Biggie experience. #HappyBirthdayBiggie. #LiveBig #TBT
and I’m like should I punch back? or should I just you know, "Party &amp; Bullsh*t"?
So I’m in the middle of the fight on the stage really getting punched... lol.
We are all on stage and it gets real hyped and of a sudden a fight breaks out... on stage.
of course I’m about 15 years old in NYC... its my first time ever out here.
.@iamdiddy had us at the palladium and "Party &amp; Bullsh*t" was really blowing up, and everybody from Bad Boy came together.
I was “Usher” but I was more like trying to find Usher cause I just released my first album.
I'll never forget my first experience with Biggie.

.@AlishaMaxine I love when my fans completely get involved in the experience of my show.
.@Cyierra_ When I’m not expecting it. All the places I’m not looking.
.@sl_dyer5 I dont have a favorite. They’re all so different and they all represent special moments in my life.
.@eray_elizabeth I could be going hard doing something I dont want to do. I’m blessed to do something I love. That makes me go harder.
.@Illy_usherdaily Yeah man. @ScandalABC is one of my favorites. @SHO_Homeland , @GameOfThrones , @BreakingBad_AMC, @EmpireFOX too.
.@MRS_USHERIV No not at all. It was intended to be fun. I’m happy people are enjoying it.
.@Simone_95 I meditate and I pray with my band.🙏 That is definitely what helps to calm my nerves.
.@AmigoJen @sesamestreet I will. Stay tuned.
Now i'm going to answer some ?s from #TeamUsher
Thank you @twitter @TwitterMusic @TheGRAMMYs and most of all Uncle Charlie @ImCharlieWilson See you Sunday #GRAMMYs
.@ImCharlieWilson All of them actually. At some point I wanted to do a collaboration with every one of them. So far @Pharrell only.
.@ImCharlieWilson Possibly neither. Coming in an Usher ensemble.🎩 #AskUsherAndCharlie
.@ImCharlieWilson I just want to do something positive with my talent. So it’s nice to be honored for something I love to do.
.@ImCharlieWilson If you had to just pick one, what is your favorite song to perform new or old from your catalog? #AskUsherAndCharlie
.@ImCharlieWilson It’s my opportunity to connect with my fans and do what I love most. Dance, sing and perform LIVE. #AskUsherAndCharlie
.@ImCharlieWilson Uncle Charlie we all see how much energy you have when you are on stage. What is your favorite part about performing?
.@ImCharlieWilson This is true. Go to http://t.co/HrZEfM2ywQ if you want to meet me along way starting in Europe Feb 27 #AskUsherAndCharlie
.@ImCharlieWilson I hear you are going out on your #ForeverCharlieTour next week. What can fans expect from your show? #AskUsherAndCharlie
.@ImCharlieWilson It starts with chemistry. But then a GREAT song, and a great visual #AskUsherAndCharlie
.@ImCharlieWilson Your new album #ForeverCharlie was just released. Do you have a favorite track from the album? #AskUsherAndCharlie
.Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Prince, Michael Jackson, James Brown &amp; YOU @ImCharlieWilson #AskUsherAndCharlie
@ImCharlieWilson You're nominated for 2 Grammys this year for Best Rap Song &amp; Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. How does that feel?
.@ImCharlieWilson It’s always great to be nominated. I have won 8 times but never a televised award. #AskUsherAndCharlie
