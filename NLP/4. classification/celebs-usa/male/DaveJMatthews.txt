Its my favorite rock record my favorite country record. I can’t stop listening. Get a song for free @ http://dannybarnes.com.
Danny Barnes’ new album Pizza Box is out today on iTunes. I love the man and I love his music. You will too.
The finger has an ability to cause instant anger and I would hate anyone to get slapped or popped in the head for it. Leave it on Twitter.
I would suggest that we should not take the bird flipping public as the majority of people would not understand and things might get ugly.
http://yfrog.com/0ulovj United afront  Hello
http://yfrog.com/0cwm9j
I haven't smoked in over three years.
@lucky2bjes that's great
@addicted2dMb thanks for using my bird frog.
@3_Daughters of course. Yes of course.
@sweetestflowers
Thanks for the fingers. I'll get mine up when I'm near my computer.
@matthewmslc I'm sorry. I meant I was breaking my contract with the fans.  That's what I meant. Any other contracts are off my radar.
Birds birds birds
I will. I just have to figure it out. I'm very stupid. http://yfrog.com/18xvrj Backwards
Mine already is but the mountain in the background looks like a dogs head.
What if everyone's Twitter picture was of them flipping the bird. Maybe for a couple days. Maybe forever. Meant well or not. Just fun no?
@Madone_99301 what is that sculpture behind you.
I'm getting a little chalk board to talk. Maybe I'll just crawl back under my quiet musky rock. I like bugs and critters. No pot of gold.
I should stop eating frogs and horses or I'll go the way of the old woman that was and swallowed a fly. She's dead of course. Thanks y'all
Flip me the bird.
The fact that the cancellation happened in salt lake again is even more frustrating. Im truly sorry. If you see me in the grocery store....
I'm very sorry for cancelling the show. I guess a snow day is better than early retirement. I just hate cancelling shows. Broken contract.
I'm afraid my voice is f*cked. I'm sorry if I sound like shit. Doctors. Give that horse a shot so he can finish the race.
I had a very good day. But the frog in my throat turned out to be a cane toad.
@electriceals yes I did
@sotsirhc hey
@gerdakay everybody needs a hand up.
Hey frank
@YeeJay I did not see you but I thought about you which should count for something.

@DaveCooksAllTha lovely bird indeed
@StinkyTPinky turtles return to the same place. I discovered this recently. Your turtles are headed back to where you found them. GPS

Hello.
Massey has absolutely no concern for the environment. The exploitation by mountaintop removal is cheaper and takes less labor. Poison sludge
@bischoffcr303 I wish that day was today but that certainly should be the day we're heading toward. Before the last mntn falls.
I love west Virginia.If Massey continues coal mining I wish they'd tunnel and not cap. It would mean more jobs and not flatten the mountains
@B__ fine foto
@myfavoritesong lake city? So slow. Not good. Bummer.
I think all our videos are available on our website. Is it not possible to get those outside the US.
@ddutton10 fiction
I'm sorry. I will look into it. http://yfrog.com/17resiwgj
I hope Obama doesn't loose heart in this bombardment of lies from the right. Fox news has perfected disinformation to a magic act.
Medicare is the most socialist part of our medical system. I don't think many Americans  know what socialism is. Strange. Fox News= garbage.
@hannahogren I get tired sometimes. I don't get the Mondays.
@koreelove I am not on facebook
@seattleite2 how funny.
@TwoSteppinAnt yes

There is a new Dmb app on iTunes. The friend that fixed my Twitter showed it to me. I'm  Someluckydevil.
@melissadianep a friend fixed my Twitter. A very handsome young man.
I enjoyed tonight a great deal.
Twitter don't work. She's broken
Love Canada
@kritty60 what on earth are you talking about? Sledgehammer was stop motion and took forever. This was a single take and took 9 minutes. ??
There is a video of Classic cartoons edited together to fit Funny that is quite magical. Very clever bastard made that one.
I heard that some people missed the point of my new video for funny. I love it. Had a blast making it. One take. It took nine minutes.
@Kthib123 @Sweet_I if my memory was worth a damn I would promise

@YeeJay I did not know. You could just be fucking with me though.
@VElectronic lisbon!
@raywerth mr werthman. I hope all is well with you and yours. Much love. Mmmm pancakes
I like skworm pronounced squirm.
Originally 'squirm' was 'skworm' but then I wrote the lyrics and thought if I kept it 'skworm' people would think I couldn't spell 'squirm'.
I have anxiety when I have to fill out forms. Always have. I am incredibly stupid. A bad speller. Now and then I surprise myself. Squirm.
I think the leaks may have been part of a grand plan of which I had no part. Thanks for the info. Maybe I wasn't paying attention....
Twitter looks all fancy now. Fancy pants. I will shave so as not to offend.
Not completely untwittered. I take it the album leaked. Nobody tells me anything.

No news is good news. But there's always news. Taliban is back. Bigger than ever. I like to thank Dick and W for a job well done. Dick

I just read about a deadly strain of swine flu. CNN twitter

Waking up on a bus. I like it. Coffee coffee coffee.
@missashleyn happy birthday.
Every year 2.2 million people die from diarrhea  caused most often by ingesting fecal matter in food or water.
Poop killing children. That could be the name of a band. They might be an alternative band. We need an alternative to alternative.
@111NICIA !!!!!!
@111NICIA I actually quite like justin. I hope he's not taking offense.
@PennyLanes2 you should do a little research. A turd, sure. Six billion?
Bird bath. Toes in the sink. Splash splash. Bird bath.
Justin is a thoughtful gentleman who's quite understandable concern for all the garbage we produce precludes him from concern for the poooop
Big truck. Forget about the truck. "Mountain of" then. The point being ample
Just kidding justin. Still
I don't think we can forget the crap justin. Just cause garbage is your bag doesn't mean the world should forget about poop you narcissist.
Blue water.
@sylviaginsberg  I was looking at the artwork. I'm happy. Like a little story book. I worked hard at it. Scribble scribble every song lyric.
Burnt my mouth on too hot coffee. Idiot. 6 billion people must make a truckload of poop everyday. I don't mean to dwell.....
@EmilyNYC how nice.
@technosailor any solutions wise one.
@thecoldplayfan yes
@bamadog like to laugh at them. Gonna stop at a truck stop to see what bad movies they have. Sore throat.
@AllanGoesDMB I'm in a bus.
@klastalov yours is my favorite photo on twitter mr Klastalov.
I like "hope will never be silent". My throat hurts. Driving to Virginia. Thinking about what bad horror movie I should watch.
First night jitters, second night jitters and everynight jitters. Thanks y'all.
why don't we start the day off with a little bit of new music...Funny The Way It Is. http://bit.ly/dmb2009

@mbrosen slip slidin' away. Slip slidin' away. You know the nearer your destination the more you're slip slidin' away.
@Billy_Ward that would make more sense than DC has made in decades. I bet people on back rooms are talking about it. My fingers are crossed.
@VAgirl2 I just googled it. California's Death Penalty system costs taxpayers over 100million  a year. I just farted. Maybe.
@VAgirl2 since the early '80s death penalty cost NJ $250million over and above what life sentences would have cost the system.
@__Tammy your sentence
@mbrosen it doesn't work that way. People are on death row for decades. Appeals, security, legal expenses... All on taxes.
@dmblauren I'm liberal from tip to tail
It would be funny if the economy and the shortage of cash was the reason the death penalty was finally discontinued.
Although I wouldn't mind having a couple people removed from the planet I'm opposed to the death penalty.
I don't want to leave this place. It is the finest city. I can't wait to come back here.
I'm leaving NOLA. I
@PrincessPeb @Peeks I envy your bat house.
@dreamgir1 it is not intentional.
@Simszy simple. I'm still trying to find a method. It still just madness.
@Peeks what a cool name.
@KingCotton I think you should add big whiskey to your name.
@kenmrcm1 @dsheredy I will say this. The title came before the lyric.
@pieshopgirl I kinda like the wired guy.
@pieshopgirl maybe I should take a picture of my mug and. Call it toes.
@pieshopgirl which toes is it? These toes or the earlier toes. Not that it matters. Nose or toes.
@DaveBuchholz41 and good day to you sir.
@pieshopgirl you're toes are surprising.
@RayshanDMB yes
@jpwrye41 thanks
@SuzanneMonroe you can still have one.
@lucky2bjes it's hard to imagine it's very cold anywhere when it's so warm in new Orleans.
@CrazyEasy I guess I'm out of the loop on decisions. That's okay as long as it's the name I wanted.
@CrazyEasy did somebody tell you the real name yet?
@CrazyEasy hello there. I hope you're well. I remember you and your friends. I am not serious about these names for the album yet.
@LauraChiovitti it's from a roger miller song. He was a great songwriter. Frank himself into an early grave.
@bondooo7 I will build a bat house against the side of my house. A huge bat house. Then at night I will watch them pour into the air.
@marley1964
@Lindajones2520 no
@DMBwine but there's no little wooden thing at the end.
@DMBwine that's probably what I should do. I should probably read or have some coffee. Anyway. This is kinda like whittling. Good evening.
@Luv2CuSmile nothing can me done
@bigbrowneyes Bam!
@dmbROADIE I have bats that live in my home in VA. They fly around at night making bat noises. I like bats.

@PennyLanes2 do you see negative... The eye of the beholder.
@zachx maybe they could give the donation under an assumed name like "Kenny's Kwality Kwilters". But Ishare your distrust.
The KKK should put everything they have into legalizing gay marriage then bury themselves to the neck near a colony of fire ants. Seriously.
@Lais_camargo I might have been joking about "party bombs..." but not about "mickey..."
@Cregncole good day to you
Or how about.... "Mickey McMantle Piece Meal Ticket: Not Until This Room Is Spotless"
Party Bombs volume TWO Cajun Backfire  Do y'all like that as the album title?

There are many great books...not about farting. The scatolog is a good coffee table book.
I have no idea what I'm saying.
@lucky2bjes truth is the subject of great controversy. Lies are lies but truth? Snails, and mice and pretty doggies. No lies and no help.
@HalloweenBaby never?
@DavidJBuchholz hello
@gone2dmb the snail would need to be incorporated into something more but you're right. I do not find snails arrousing at all.
@sweetestflowers pffft
@snowfall36 dunno
@peaceloverock hello
@artisalie I find snails strangely arrousing
@espo7 I don't know how to respond. You are such a wonderful person. Termites. Fabulous. Smallest dog ever was 2.5inches tall and 3.75 long.
@espo7 is a snail a bug?
I wonder if snail farts smell if you're close enough to the snail's asshole to smell something so tiny?
@Sarahcecilia91 they're a great bunch of guys. I love them.
@sweetestflowers crap
@Maquis happily
@marley1964 why are your feelings hurt.
@pieshopgirl very good thanks
@pieshopgirl you can do either niether or both.
@Luv2CuSmile congratulations
@PennyJane people keep putting their toes in their twitter pics. Feet are fine but I didn't start it.
@crashintomedave you can take a hint when?
Cheers to you. I think the vibe is good in here. Carter is a miracle.
@BVA4134 fish never fart ever....whales fart though....big whale farts
@NoLidUponMyHead it was a little epiphone(Gibson) my neighbor gave me.
I go up the list. It's a nice distraction and occasionally terrifying one.
@BrookeAllyce lovely toes. Very presentable toes indeed
@irishprincess41 coughing can be exhausting

http://twitpic.com/1b2gc http://twitpic.com/1b2gy http://twitpic.com/1b2h8 I must chip away at the stone and see what's on the inside.
I have many guitars more than I need.
@jonnyrocket good work. Work is good anyway, but good work.....
@gone2dmb yes mam

@lucky2bjes I like that.
@letmeclimbup I think I like her version more. She has the feckin' sexiest voice.
@jonnyrocket biked around the zoo and a park and along the Mississippi with my family. A good day.
@ygeorgia I don't think spiders shit webs. They most certainly fart though.
@pieshopgirl it is inevitable that local produce will become stronger and stronger. The opposite is unsustainable. Truly unstoppable
@escapendreams hey
@gone2dmb
@Audioptics often one uses 'you' instead of 'one' which confused us into thinking one is referring to me.
@RecentlySpooned butt your grammar.
@PennyJane good night
@41proudmonkeys Richard pryor.
@ladyvirginia you're magical aren't you?
@UVaHoo I believe I made a typo there. Favourite has an 'e' at the end.

@rayraywerthmann ray. You're awesome. Good to see you friend. Will you bring the family out this summer. Please.

@MissBeckala my apologies.
@MissBeckala hello.
@MissBeckala I am not doing anything with intent.
@SuzanneMonroe thank you suzanne. It follows that if insects fart so do spiders. That's all I need. Good night, sleep tight.
@sweetestflowers I like your pictures
@AllanGoesDMB several a night or several in a lifetime?
@dreamngtreehugr yes
@lucky2bjes I hope the evening finds you warmer.
@Audioptics how does someone have their picture deleted? Are there hands at work I'm unaware of.
@sweetestflowers put up a new picture.
@dreamngtreehugr I hope you like it.
@cmsanderson I don't know what it is that breaks your heart.
@johndrobbins they must shit right? If a thing shits doesn't it follow that it farts.
@iheartdmb what is the battle your husband believes you are losing.
@Audioptics yes he does
@somemaysay pretty birds
Do spiders fart

@natesaul I like a clean tub
@Ocalawriter I love "tthe office".

@squarecloud susette
@letmeclimbup don't catch a cold.
I don't watch much tv at the moment. So it goes. Link tv is good. I have seen American idol. I don't watch it.
Good work today.
@somemaysay I always like hearing from you. Take liberty.

Cake balls?
@Lindajones2520 when major beers went wierd with clear beer and stupid promo tactics microbrews came to the rescue.
@sweetestflowers good then
@alaska737 strangely crunchy and slimey at the same time. Although it doesn't sound that foreign I think raw beef liver is the strangest.
@kaitlin12 no jets, Very still, Very hot, very quiet.
@lizettesonnet seal oil, raw beef liver or hippo. I ate termites(flying ants) in south Africa. Unsurprising flavor until one bit my lip.
@chillinman @dmbsredhead good luck. I have been drinking an abita or two between abitas already. Thanks.
@bamadanni how would I go about stealing your weight loss thunder were I to want to steal it?
I ate a kangaroo steak in Australia. It was fabulous.

@Lynnie36 hello. Sleep. Bath. Run!!!! Or walk
@UVaHoo I'd be surprised if there was more than flies buzzing around my head and decomposition but what do I know.
@JonesyFlynn I must have forgotten it.
@Amyastring I did see them.
@kkea it'll hold.
@LovelyLady if you are telling the truth, and I will assume you are, the ice house fart is only specific in severity. Just uncommonly foul.
@somemaysay round and round. Now you should steal baboon food.
@ambyrle missed it still
What is an icehouse fart?
@katelynkay like a pool of hippos planning a water landing
@katelynkay sometimes my stomach sounds as if it is a gathering conspiring....
Egg farts can be quite stunning
so it goes
Dying can be sad. Dead not as much
I went to see some of the areas that remain unfixed since Katrina. It is criminal how neglected parts of LA and Miss. remain. Shameful.
I'm with my family. Up early with my boy. Found a tiny dead frog in a fountain. It was belly up and delicate with precious little fingers.
Dead frog in a fountain
@sassy007 niether do I.
@lucky2bjes good evening friend. Little bird.
@marissab41 good cheer. Sleep well. In here.

@v4micajr nothing means anything and everything is made up.
@RiverdeepANDRed it is a beautiful and kind place right now. As far as I can tell.
@Maquis it's not the time zone. I stumble into the room and then stumble out. I hope this finds you well.
@somemaysay you have not missed me my knysna friend.
@nationwideclass evening brian
@wanttobeamoore boom boom boom

@StinkyShelby typp

@IconoChris generous bugga
@mandaland lovely
@WivesWitches unless you're guilty.
@Amybtru4DMB one person's douchebag is another person's hot water bottle. I love a hot water bottle.
@Crazi4DMB how could I miss such a rare opportunity. Thanks
@lucky2bjes from the neck up, wake up, fill the garbage truck, go to sleep and empty it. Sleep is good work.
@Lynnard1 @junebug23 I'm in the dark.
@kkea I missed both chances.

The ashes
It is good down here.
New Orleans is my new favorite. Beautiful and warm(freezing the last few days) and good good people. A bit scary. Beautiful music. I love it
Hello
Some twitters are hard to follow.
Animals just exploit our kindly human disposition.
@spacebetween41 I only beat big animals with small expensive instruments. Very very hard. And kids
@jarredt still using commodor 64
@TwoSteppinAnt I beat my bulldog sophie with the veillette
@kijahski you are correct
@chirogirl slaughterhouse 5
@pieshopgirl I must start with the yoga again.

Sleep can be an elusive bed partner. Caffeine and water will give the appearance of a well rested participant.
@AllanGoesDMB taht was dficulft for me to mkae sense of. Hlelo
@jdub2131 maybe someone should start giving out the pain without the piercing or tattoo as the result. On 2nd thought, I'm sure someone has
I have never had a tattoo or a piercing and I have often admired them on other. On occasion I wonder why.
@LovelyLady "red shoes". A beautiful song off tom waits "Blue valentine".... 99, 100.
@dmblauren yes I am
@lucky2bjes is that a DNA strand running down you spine?
I am a sour99 year old man trapped inside a soon to be 42year old, devil may care, chimp that pretends to be a performing seal. Sexu
@somemaysay prosopagnosia. It is a good word. I head to the New Orleans today. I am anxious. That's alright though.
@designateddrive Virginia 'til tomorrow
I expect I might have things to say that are more satisfying to read once I get back into the studio.
Here
I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday. I am in the tub staring out the window into the forest. The sky pretending it would like to snow.
@IHaveNoLid never throw
@lucky2bjes not too far depending on the town.
There are better floors than others. No doubt there are some floors better than some beds.
@lucky2bjes in the sink
@WivesWitches @WivesWitches if you stood next to me you would see they gray in evidence that I have not yet died my aging head.
@TrekLightGear thankyou
@RiverdeepANDRed I had never thought of it. But it's the illusion I'm drawn to. If I am a friend to my enemies I won't bury them. Gobbledygu
@aaronzimmer a little foggy
@BrookeTackeff pitch then
@sweetestflowers picture changer.
I have slept on many floors in many places and intend not doing it, unless by choice, ever again. I think I'll not. I don't mind the floor.
Busy holidays?
Shaved.
Swallowed by YOUR farts
I watch sometimes from out here in the dark. Coffee and crapping out the sins of an ill spent yesterday and the day before. Best wishes.
I try and try. From the woods. My twitters won't go. Hello hello.
@somemaysay knysna for Christmas. Thanks. Can't stop eating. My sisters eggnog leads to holiday oblivion. Timber!!!!!
I am in the woods of Virginia enjoying peace and family. My farts could melt the polar ice caps if I'm not a little more sparing. Greetings.
Hoping it will snow in Virginia. A Great fluffy carpetting.
@AmandaRae5 maybe one snowman to start and one angel
@bryant41 have youself a merry little Christmas. There are many versions. I like it because it is sad. I love frank sinatra's version.
@bryant41 just out and about
@lucky2bjes winter feels right when we wake up to snow.
@theideaofyou Seattle is covered in a beautiful blanket of white
@sweetestflowers snow snow.
@wondrous_as_u coming down.
@seattlemelissa snow in Seattle. Snow still snowing. A day late and better better better. Snow snow. Snow. Doughnuts and coffee.
http://twitpic.com/t9pa http://twitpic.com/t9pf
Just going to get started now. Then the band will converge on new Orleans in January.
@crashintomedave hello. I read and enjoy.
@lindajones2520 I noticed nothing dirty.
@DavidJBuchholz beautiful new photo.
@AnyoneElseButU I'm trying to make out the reflection in your eye.
@jennysmooth happy birthday! To you.
@Sugarwilla is that real. Thanks
@dark_continent I wish you all the patience you need. Grabbing mist discribes your frustration. Sleep well.
@blondie41 warm and well. Today is my last day in the studio for this year. Then fatherhood and coffee and feckin' Christmas.
@linrose are those rasberries
@vickievictoria not too much but with a little effort not much snow goes magic anyway.
@somad ice and cold in Seattle probably doesn't mean the same as ice and cold in your part of the world.
@lisala47 an interesting combination. It sounds delightful. Explain, if you would be so kind.
@Mingledew !
@melissaef is there a bunch of snow where you are?
@lisala47 green
@Paty74 I see
@LovelyLady jackman is a sexy man
Carrot. Purple carrot. They're called love carrots by some folks.
@CrazyEasy it doesn't look too bad where you are. I would mind waking up there. Brazil is beautiful.
http://twitpic.com/sx5c
Snow in seattle
I had to collect snow off all the cars so there was enough to make a reasonable snowman.
@ladyvirginia Made a snowman.
Snow!!!!
@Davedigger happy belated birthday.
@Best4uRapunzel I'm always waiting. I hope you enjoy the wait though.
@soulpole23 I hope this evening finds you well my friend.
@soulpole23 I hope your day was all you'd hoped would be and that tomorrow is perfectly as it should be. hope you smile so big.
@lucky2bjes always so kind
@sweetestflowers
Running off though. No reason.
@JBo48 really.
@WivesWitches where are you
@LovelyRita13 fingers
@heartcornbread pardon. I trust that was warm and kind
@SeekUp11ND hello. Good day today.

@Sugarwilla kind madam
@SUNNYRAE leggz
http://twitpic.com/s9p3 And a good day to all. Running late as I became laid back in the tub.
@gerdakay we are coming.
@YouShine what are you doing in this picture.
@littlesister41 smiling
http://twitpic.com/s2w3 Scribble scratch. I like today. I was up in the wee hours writing on little blue papers and it was not all crap.
@white014 I dreamt I was your girlfriend.
@Marmalade_Skies I tend to think it's easy to answer when there's no question. And not when there is. Hello
Good morning. Sometimes sleep avoids me.
@FarmBarn I hope your exam/ test went well
@sweetestflowers you flatter me so early in the morning.
@kbk33 I am teased. That is the truth. Gladly. Goodnight.
@wondrous_as_u I think I've seen you and that dog before. In the real world.
@YouShine hello.
@mluedke it wouldn't be reasonable for me to refuse. Of course.
@Amybtru4DMB
@NBMutsch muffins and cake
@RiverdeepANDRed lucky you
@Granny_LoveBaby mollie
Listening to sax and working on some ideas in the studio. I am hungry. I think I will get some dinner.
Off to work.
@alexpooch I enjoy the studio very much if that's what you asking. I spend as much time as I can there.
I like that little blue cat VAgirl2
@DreamingBri what is it that we are trying in a week.

@sunonhand who are they.
@wondrous_as_u good dog
@IHaveNoLid very good. I'd dare say it's better than the original.
@SHELLYBELLI lippy lunch
@somemaysay all the way in knysna.
Off to the studio. Very tired.
@ambyrle hot tea, water, hot bath, hot toddy.....
@FallLikeRain muddy toes. hello
More coffee and more coffee and shake me more like a monkey.
@jennihoos no doubt it dpes

@bryant41 I am having a satisfying wrestle for it.
@coffeewithian in food or in the tall grass?
@gerdakay I do I do I do. Hello
@DayseluvsDMB the rest is ugly sleep
@DayseluvsDMB 4hrs
@B__ shameless but a tad resigned with a sigh
Plastic potato eyes, plastic potato tongue, plastic potato nose.
@sweetestflowers more and more I look like mr. potato head.
Lucky2bjes. I hope you are holding up.
@d1ssident hello there. I suppose I might be a bit of a truffle and champagne socialist. But I'll rob myself and by everyone a sandwich.
@nutmeg41 I must get a cup of joe.
@177ya @bigbrowneyes just what a weatherman said. Maybe. I don't know about predicting the weather.
I'm diving under the water for a while. Hello.
@dreamingtree40 that's rather an open ended request. With what you've given me.... I'll try.
@Its_Me_DMB_Fan I have a quirky nerve in the tip of my left pinky that sends misinformation to my weathered headquarters. I have feelings.
@whichfish uncrossed fingers are more useful. Fish
@Dreamgirl_br can you tell me how things turn out for me?
@manoli one day.
It might snow Friday here in Seattle.
@DavidJBuchholz ggood day to you too
@KevinEPearson the 3 videos I made were all single takes. That was enormous fun.
@KevinEPearson I did play everything on the original "eh hee". One drum at a time and making loops. I have a small pile of songs like that.
@FallLikeRain good day to you too
Chilly morning Seattle. Maybe today I will dig a well shaped pit or maybe I'll hit rocks or an old buried road. Cold fingers.
@koreelove good luck
@pieshopgirl William is me of my favorite people in the world. It's been a while.  Yes, we are family.
@gone2dmb back to the tree then

@bryant41 woof dog. I am feckin' overheating in this tub.
@k8m24 I don't follow. Would you explain  more clearly what you mean.
@DMBdaveFan that had to hurt.
@UVaHoo I would like you to make it snow in Seattle please. Big puffy mountain snow.
@UVaHoo pardon?....let it out....  Not forgetting to breath of course.
All the cats are away and the mouse is in the tub.
@ColdenGrey I only have this account. I heard tell of a second. I know nothing. I am also not on facebook
I'm on the west coast. I have not been to haunted hollow in a while.
@lulularu good luck tonight.
I have amassed quite a collection of Steve Keene paintings. I find his paintings turn up the world over.
@lucky2bjes tequila
@MustLuvDmb ??
@tlopez sometimes it's a walk in the park and other times it's more like labour.
Belltown
Back to work.
@AmandaRae5 very good.
@pieshopgirl yoga. I must do it again. I do not deliver it as gracefully as your pictures do.
@Its_Me_DMB_Fan I don't know how to twit downsideup
@jazztiger I love Sydney. I would very much like to be next to you.
@lilbucknuts41 happy birthday.
@lilbucknuts41 I believe I was 26 and in the shoes of a friend when I penned it.
@FarmBarn you won't believe then that I first wrote it with an 'o' and then was corrected...wrongly I guess.  yours truly   poop head
@AllanGoesDMB more than likely.
@bherd enjoy it for both of us.
@erictruman1 Thankyou eric. May I add that today, my farts could stop a charging elephant.
I'm sorry I always talk about scatalogical things or things related to them. I just find them amusing. Endlessly amusing. Kids understand.
I like this song. I am feeling good. Tired as a bastard. I have legs. I always have trouble with the spelling of diarhea.
@qoolquest really? That's pretty awesome.
@emulatori hello. Enjoy dinner. Goodnight
@dixeechicken all the night owls
I'm still sitting in the studio. Scratching my head and my belly. Getting tired. Good work. Welcome home Shelly's belly. Home would be nice.
@alreinke17 never too cold, never too hot... to go outside.
Yesterday was work. The kind that won't give, but one can't walk away. I feel good about the effort like digging a hole. Morning coffee.
@Lou13358 not interesting in throwing anything away. I don't think like that
@Lou13358 I remember this
@dmb4141 just squiggled on a photo
@TracyA72 tweet
@afranks chill in the air. Coffee. Yes.
@lucky2bjes I think I missed it too.
@cmsanderson how could I not
@TexterDexter one or the other. I have but half a brain but the half I have is boggling itself.
http://twitpic.com/ps67
@JEmiliani old sound check.
@DMBSFgirl hello there
@rae4dmb I do not have the same opinion of my work. I remain frustratingly unimpressed. I keep trying.
@Julie5610 I have heard nothing of the music of which you speak.
@ali815 I was aware that certain things are hard to control during childbirth. Magic power
@LovelyLady no offense taken. Quite the contrary. I tend to ramble on
@lucky2bjes who's scribbling?
I am in the studio. Sitting at the piano. Things are forming from the broken stones. I think I like it. I'm sorry I've been so absent. Good.
@lucky2bjes hello
Sitting by the fire. Everyone's asleep. I sip and think of blessings and what ifs. Outside it is raining here in Virginia.
@SelfReliance3 that's presumptuous of you. Like a fresh morning breeze. Like honeysuckle. My farts. Like Christmas morning. Yes indeed.
@Granny_LoveBaby I'm a geek. Or I like to think I am.
@SHELLYBELLI   I'm not much of an actor but I like to say yes when I should probably say "lemme get back to you".
@Steelbreeze676 nursery rhyme. But thanks for looking out for me.
@SHELLYBELLI fun can be fun
@Hazyswife I beg to differ. I do too.
Sun goes up.... Sun goes down...all the world...spinning 'round
My farts smell like applepie baking in the oven or lavender or....
I hope everyone had a good day yesterday. I know I did. Love love love. And warm farts.
@CourtneyCooper don't let these idiots change your plans.
@dark_continent all the way down there? Really? Sleep well.

@kdbarnes I never thought about my birthday in relation to Xmas other than winter was good when I was little in NY.
@scarlet628 late and broke. Bummer. Hope it turns out.
It snowed one day when I was in high school in Johannesburg and most of the kids had never seen snow before. What a blast.
@twodmbstep I don't know.
Beautiful you. The weather in Seattle is sunny for this time of year. It snows here sometimes. Radiant.
good morning Mary.
@Dreamgirl_br rub yourself together 'til you feel better. Good day.
@lindajones2520 olleh
@Dreamgirl_br my pleasure.
@dmb4141 I scribble everywhere. On my iPhone notepad and on every unused corner of paper. Most goes the way of the wind.
@halloweenbaby  Things suck sometimes, but as sure as shit they will improve. Be selfish when you need to. Shamelessly think whatever....
@saraknight13 friends, friends, baths, and don't give up your ghost. Don't apologize.
@collhugstrees do people film you getting gas all the time?

UVaHoo thakks
Did I mention that I enjoy getting advice. I do. I don't, however, always take it.
I felt terrible for that poor bear but that great big and did I mention naked man was horrid.
The differences between us, our successes and failures, our rewards or punishments are tiny compared to the power we each have in common.
A dream is a massive magic trick of the mind. No amount of science could explain away the mysterious wonder.
...the man lay on the ground, naked screaming curses and spitting blood while the bear sobbed, leaning heavily on a taxi cab. The monkeys.
...in the end the bear lost his eyes and both the great big man and the bear had blood pouring from their toothless mouths....
@fedupbigtime I dreamed there were monkeys in Seattle. Many monkeys. A man and a polar bear had a brutal fight. Cursing and screaming....
I wonder what percentage of the people who are rushing out and buying guns in response to Obama's election watch fox news.
I love to get advice. There is an on and off threat of sunshine. I will wrap up and take a walk.
Good night and sweet sleep
@fedupbigtime yes. Interpret as you will.
@cmsanderson now you are talking. Find your friends and forget the rest. Love love love.
@dmb4141 probably yes
@zachyd I hope all goes well.
@UVaHoo of course.
@UVaHoo you owe me nothing which is how much university should cost.
@cmsanderson a bath and friends.
@express41 of course
@itsjustmeagain high to you. I am curious. I hope you are well. Only me  wondering how you are.
@SHELLYBELLI clever
@SullivanW I certainly feel as if I'm choking sometimes. It's work/ it's easy.
@StinkyShelby why would you be broken.
@DankNoise I just walk around the edges. Sshhh I'm not going anywhere.
@sassy001 I love from one extreme to the other. Rubyfruit jungle to bald as a qball.
@Audioptics no no no shame. Not here. That's no good.
@yuhas9797 how so?
@dmblauren I don't think I was in on the whole thing actually.
@jhdoll7 hello stranger
@kkea I happily remain unqualified in the eyes of experts. I couldn't be happier. I'm no john Mayer.

@LisaMara I still love her. We met and I was speechless.

@mandaland close your eyes and try find the bathroom. Go and be nice to yourself. I hope I'm not being to presumptuous. All the best.
@gerdakay you make what you believe is right and wrong and try tour nest to make the world like your insides.
@lucky2bjes you should always feel clever. If you can. I'm happy to see the water's still running.
@Audioptics the world will be a battle between vengeance and forgiveness, love and fear, courage and hate, peace and violence.Keep the hope.
@ColdenGrey so you can be a magic hand in their children's lives. Chin up.
@crashintomedave all all all
@meggieprice all courage and good luck to you. Take care.
@SullivanW I stole mine from a photo shoot. I think that means I ended up paying double.
@zachyd my friend would you be so kind as to pass my good wishes to your mother?
@elysedavene thanks. I forget songs quite often. I don't know how. Like dreams maybe.
@elysedavene @ricaj54 enjoying your day.

@sdphish i habe been to canlis a couple times.
@agentla generous of you.
@lmb42 of course
@Coatney there have been days when I think twitter has been a tool for me to tell people quickly what was on my mind. Lately I just babble.
@KLfaux you end up being too generous. But I don't mind
@HalloweenBaby wow. Choices choices choices
@HalloweenBaby don't die.
@DreamingBri don't bite please
@CamiRose groovalicious you

@courtwerthmann that would be awesome. Will we see you this summer. I'm always uplifted when you come.
@jaymel22 my daughters' 5th birthday.

@gone2dmb I have a general fetish.
@dmbsredhead of course
@jaymel22 hey jay
@mandaland you are always good
@so_be_it endless tea. I like throat coat tea. It makes me feel nursed.
@SHELLYBELLI you'll find your moment. Until you do, enjoy smoking. No point feeling guilty. Stop when you stop. BANG.
@SHELLYBELLI I have not smoked for two years. I haven't had the urge to start. I found a moment that worked. No drugs, patches, hypnosis....
@SpencerDS never
@sweetestflowers it would be wrong of me not to.
@dmblauren I hope things work out okay.
@lucky2bjes I trust your evenings are going to be glorious.

@SuzanneMonroe no permission required. I'll listen.
@SuzanneMonroe is there soMeone in particular?
@lucky2bjes of course you should bring it up.
@jamiedancenyc I don't know. But I'm curious.
@dmblauren for what.
@lucky2bjes very nice.
@Hambone4mayor off the cuff maybe.
@kalamazu my grandad fought in north Africa. His dog stopped waiting for him at the gate. Until the day he came home. The dog waited again.
@spacebetween41 very good then.

@jrzbuffalo prius
@gezebel yes?
@lucky2bjes lovely bird bath little bird toes
@mustluvdmb hey kids
@Jhinds76 don't you get to decide whether or not a tree falling made a sound... And whether or not it was funny.
@jrzbuffalo love is love and between consenting adults, whoever they may be, it should be respected without exception. It's a civil right.
@ambyrle I sorry and it should be better and it should be as convenient as possible and extend the service to  military kin. It's shameful.
I way a small hippo and fart like a pack of hyena.
@Kinnamonster1 dirty?
@AllanGoesDMB my thoughts. I meant to be clear. My thoughts were lobbying for attention.
And who better than you...
@gone2dmb I can find him if you really think it matters more than mildly.
@PrdstMnky32 lyle lovett
@YeeJay madonna is the most powerful agent in the world.
@lucky2bjes I where plastic undies on my shorn vagina
@bamadanni but I think one can direct the flow of things and create one's own good fortune.
@SHELLYBELLI I had many answers jumping up and down, lobbying for attention, and I modestly landed on that one.
@SHELLYBELLI you're lucky?
@cweb23 he never farts ever
@mjones23 veterans should get free medical care, regardless of of their health for the rest of there lives without any inconvenience at all
@mjones23 whoever holds their breath the longest gets their way.
Farting in the tub is only funny if someone is with you. Not necessarily in the tub though.
@MelindaLauren I rather like this one melinda
@daveMfan I like ziti.
@ColdenGrey good
@gerdakay Italian food and wine.
@AnimalLvrGal whether or not we believe in a god, it makes sense. You are perfectly you. Go ahead and struggle to be yourself.
@AnimalLvrGal I heard a rabbi say (I paraphrase) "our duty to god is to be ourselves. That is what god made us. It makes sense regardless.
@ckyro miriam makeba was one of the voices I grew up with. She lived a long life. My mom and sister and I listened to her yesterday.

@SHELLYBELLI it must have been a late night.
Carefully
@caflovesdmb one might blindly walk thru life with ones eyes open. I understand. Don't. As a cure for weariness, close you eyes and walk.
@jess_ie among other things
You must not blindly walk with eyes closed. Difficult bunch.
@gerdakay up and down and to and from and door and door
@gerdakay you gerdakay. Liberta! Liberty!

@mayasalazar no
@LuV4rocknroll hmm

Today, either history is made, or we spend another four years scraping shit off our shoes.

A huge percentage of people leave the election line to return to work.

@Cherrrylll I just got it
@Cherrrylll I don't follow
Legalization has to come from the people. To think it would come from elected officials is silly. It must come from the ground up.

@Stanley_Ipkiss Obama is the better choice, the right choice, and the only choice... I'm just saying.
@boninfer in a different world...again and again and again.
@amywojsbu these are volatile times. I'm more afraid of McCain/palin against the world policy than anything else in this country right now.
@dmb4141 often the solution to personal immigration problems is having many on your side. Differing professions. Like a job application.

@alreinke17 what a beautiful way to spend a Saturday. Zapvac. It might have a sister product for pimple removal. Followed by a rat killer.
@StinkyShelby my toyota is crappy, not all toyota cars, and it's only crappy because I don't wash it and it has some bangs. I love it.

@ali815 twopenny post was the normal cost of sending a letter in Britain in the 1800s according to ali815. Thankyou Ali.
@ali815 where do those English phrases come from?...
Just a tub. No jets, no noise. Just water and silence and books and books.
@codeyh I would like to know the origin of giving ones two cents. It's gotta be good.

@lucky2bjes how can I see pictures of all the outfits you twitterers will be sporting. Boots and all.
Tim Reynolds is not from earth and neither is Carter.
@sweetestflowers only if you paint your boot like a peacock. Oh damn. I've been hoodwinked.
Just because something doesn't appear on the next recording doesn't mean it's gone.

@xtina09 hey there
@hdys I'm with you. Peace is too often considered the absence of war. It is more than that. It is the presence of sanity.
@Girl__ I couldn't verify that.
@Girl__ was that a question? Some rats more than other.
@Girl__ yes with each moment more and more.
@SHELLYBELLI I follow NPR read the nation and like link tv for information other than what's jammed down our throught 24/7.

@somemaysay my late uncle had a place there. I visited a few times. Lovely, yes.
@david_reier 14 billion in profits and McCain wants to give them a tax break. If everyone gets a tax cut where do we get the money we need?
@aaron_king  Even some of the Fox people are starting to say Obama.
@mustluvdmb Obama is only as socialist as McCain was 8 years ago. That is, not at all. This country and the world need Obama. Your choice.
@mustluvdmb hope hope hope. People are afraid of change but we need it. We need to start making America and not just conserving it. Hope.

"Amandla: a revolution in......." is a movie.
@cmsanderson yes chelsea
Unless there is a law against speeking one's mind I think we should all be willing to make fools of ourselves in public.
@TamelaYeargin there are those who agree with you Tamela. W's political insight on the subject..."shut up and sing!" Wise democratic words.
Amandla: a revolution in four part harmony.
@TamelaYeargin garbage. By telling me your opinion aren't you abusing your power.

@HENRYGPROD  This election is the most watched in the world's history.
@MySweet3 shoes?
@dmbsredhead unforgettable
@DMBspanishrice I believe that on occasion shoes on powerlines are a form of advertising.
@jthiatt I welcome all spelling, grammatical and fact checking help people are willing to supply me with in the land of twitter and stuff.
@mandaland my word
I wonder how a shoe comes to be alone on the street. I saw a pair of shoes on a bridge in Richmond and thought "I don't want to know"
@dmtrout41 I wish it said "day is the today"

@i_had_a_clue I meant jihad and I'm so embarrassed. Forgive me linda. Thanks for that. I had just seen it online too. I'm special.
@goverjkg I think McCain might dissagree although I'm sure he'll say more or less what you wrote.
@goverjkg I heard the al Qaeda endorsement news and thought it was interesting. Food for thought. I didn't make it up. It's only information
I'm registered Virginian.
Al Qaeda endorsed McCain because they believe he is more likely to bring about an international gehad against America. For real.
@DMBDani41 thankyou for your family's service. I am indebted to you and yours.
@koreelove if McCain wins the whole world will shake it's head in winded disbelief.
@chocolateyogurt always question the government...whether or not you support it's leaders. Question authority.
@DreamGirl70 kootchi?
@chocolateyogurt find a government without corruption and it will no doubt be in a fictional land. Until there is a successful alternative..
@ButteRat not in the next week.
I believe Obama can unite the country and the world. If he wins, our standing in the world will change for the better immediately.
@TamelaYeargin philanthropy is not the same department as highways, public parks, fire departments, judicial system.
http://twitpic.com/ifwx Clown on the crapper
@WivesWitches we grow growth and free freedom and are realists.
@WivesWitches Mccain will cut tax for the wealthy and continue to alienate us from the rest of the world. Our children can pay for it.
@WivesWitches this war was the first in history to come with a tax cut. I have heard the argument your husband is making. I don't buy it.
@YeeJay I still oh you a guitar
Feeling cynical after looking at the latest polls. This election is still up for grabs. Please vote for our children. Hope! Not fear.
@PeterCCampbell good on you
McCain/palin are closing the gap. I guess tax breaks for rich and corporate America still ring true for the working American.
@FarmBarn I love milk
@faithbarnett cheers faith. Bottoms up.
@signalhill the stars are still there.
@aamato happy day to you.
@breezyb792 very nice job indeed.
@CaptAndOjPlz Sweden's doing okay. I didn't mean to offend you. Spreading wealth around a little doesn't offend me though.

@CaptAndOjPlz @DanaDMB Experience teaches you these wise words no doubt.
@pjrooney everything works. Nothing doesn't work. Rules work and so does anarchy. My monkey told me to choose any hole.
@JavierMA my cousin is shouting things at me from his desk.
@skwurlygurl Bellamy was a Christian and he was forced to leave his church for being a socialist. One can be both.
@RyanHRenner I never said we should be a socialist state. I said nothing of the sort. I said the the author of our pledge was a socialist.
The pledge of allegiance was written by Francis Bellamy. He was a socialist.

@armeyers9 it could well be a reference or not. I think that it is important that the author & the word not be mistaken for the same thing.
@TheDevilHides to say more with less or less with more.
If anyone is looking for a movie to enjoy tomorrow night please make it "choke". Wonderful, independent, heart warming, story of discovery.
@TheDevilHides I'm listening to some of the songs that we've been writing. I think I like this music very much. Carter is astonishing.

@Ltrain40 mr vertigo.
the most important thing to do, regardless of political opinion, is vote. Then we can complain about the state of things.
@CamiRose yummy
@amycello quietly agreeing
@Punzyscastle I don't expect a fight from either of them.
@skwurlygurl the voices tend to be drowned out though. If there were public financing only, it would be more even. $$ makes the contenders.
@dmb4141 @dmb4141 I had a delicious shawarma from mr gyro's on greenwood ave. Thankyou. Delicious. I want another.
@skwurlygurl the wealthy and big corporations should shoulder more of our nations financial burdens and the middle class should get a break.
@yoliaragon yup
@whatchathink   I wish there were more parties in this country. A wider debate would give us clearer political views.

hannity should be a hand model. I imagine he has nice, soft, well manicured hands. He should be quiet though.
@sassy001 it feeds on fear and half truths. It reminds me of TV under apartheid with better graphics. Intentionally dishonest and misleading
@tara4443 @ileschner Yes. Not great but I like your system in many respects...
@RyanHRenner no disagreement from me on john mcCain but fox news is a sewer. Respectfully submitted, my friend. My humble opinion.
@Gdyal21 ann coultier huge dead head. What the fah...!
There is an election special documentary on PBS Frontline tonight. Get to know the candidates better. Please turn off Fox News if it's on.
@HalloweenBaby I found a dead cat so I took it home, put honey on it, cooked it and then I ate it...do do do do doodo... Some'em like that..
@mberger36 if McCain wins and then falls ill we might as well have a bucket of spit for president.
@mberger36 no I would not vote mcCain without Palin but I could understand how someone might. With palin it's unjustifiable.
@bwaldron haha. Funny friend. I like.
@JoshJBodfield Virginia did have the first African American governor.
@Flick3 Obama has been under intense public scrutiny for two years and Palin, not so intense scrutiny for less than 2months. Come on.
@junebug23 is your boss creepy maybe?
@eatmypussy marvelous
@desert_zen I learnt that information not too long ago. It explains why some people look at me funny when I make the stinky pee assertion.

@firedancer41 vote and we don't need their agreement.
@osudavefan there is a far deeper wealth to be tapped than that of the middle class. Far deeper.
@dancingskippys Obama was a little boy when ayers committed his crimes. Is he responsible for those crimes by association. That's the point?
I am happy to have a tax hike. I'm lucky and overcompensated. Tax the wealthy! Tax 'em! tax 'em!
@osudavefan  One percent of Americans have 99% of the money...not to mention corporate America.
@dancingskippys as many rebublicans have associations with ayers as Obama does. He is in public work. They never socialized. Don't be foold
Hello
I love chicken pot pie.
Way back when McCain was running against W for the GOP ticket I thought I could vote for him. He's done a complete 180degree turn. Maveric?
@Bartender41 I love asparagus. Raw, grilled, sauteed, baked..... but if you don't like it that's just fine by me. I hate almond scented soap
If McCain's heart stops beating we'll have Palin as president and that alone should stop every republican from voting for him. God help us
McCain wants more tax cuts for the super wealthy and big corporations. Why!! why! Why!!
Obama will give a tax break to the middle class and increase taxes for big corporations and the rich (me included) and it's about time.
Sorry to come out like this. I'm just amazed that people are claiming Obama is an unknown. He has written books and been in the public eye.
Who is Sarah Palin? Do we really know who she is? Anyone know? We've only ever heard of her for 2months now. President Palin? Terrifying.

Windy birdfilled morning walk. Me and my boy. Little things are the big things. Windy day and red cheecks. Watering eyes. Good morning.
I find the state of American politics heartbreaking. And the dominant news coverage suffocating, panic inspiring, septic mis-information.
@Reevo Obama represents progress and that spirit we all want for our children. His opponent; inevitable stagnation and decline.
@Reevo  Our government is now more paranoid and defensive and fanatical thanever. The things it once opposed. Nationalism is not patriotism.
@Reevo  Until recently this country's ideals have represented the possibilities. This ideal was at the core while accepting our many flaws.
Obama is the only choice in this election. That is my humble opinion. It is essential that he is elected. God help us all if he is not elec

@Chatoehrdy also repeated structural mending. Rediculous. All over the world. I love my boots.
@Chatoehrdy these were the boots that caused me to fall, break my ass, and spill coffee all over myself. I have had them resouled 13 times.
