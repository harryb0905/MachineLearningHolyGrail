@fu6wa5ko @starsonice I wanted to compete with this music when I was junior. It was the first time I ever heard Muse! ❤️
@MtSkating @starsonice 🕺🏼🕺🏼🕺🏼 https://t.co/fVDV99rl0U
@LibbyWA @starsonice True, but I’ve done it pretty consistently for 4 years. It needs a break, or I need a break from it lol
@LibbyWA @starsonice https://t.co/51GSAxXK4n ;)
@craigfoster @starsonice @BenSPLATT It’s not quite right, but I love this suggestion! Thanks :)
@anastasure @starsonice Done! Anything in particular?
@johncanluge @starsonice You could have texted me, squid 🦑 but your input is always appreciated!
@cantufeelicks @starsonice I like your style ;)
@tinadoy88 @starsonice @Pchiddy did it way too well!!! I wouldn’t dare.
@WilliamK1313 Not at all the sound I was expecting. Thanks!
@__heck @starsonice Love her voice
Hey Fam! I am crowd sourcing music suggestions for @starsonice. What do you all want to see me skate to? Aaaaaaaand GO!
Congratulations @lindseyvonn on an amazing and historic career! You have inspired more than skiers. You are an inspiration to so many of us. Thank you for giving your heart and soul to represent @TeamUSA for so many years! Can’t wait to see what you conquer next!

Today’s life lesson is about patience, and calmly breathing rather than going into full on road rage because of other people’s ineptitude and lack of awareness! ❤️✌🏻accept the things you can’t control and control the things you can... like my bad driving attitude 😂
@tifflangston No, you! ❤️

@Mark1964Tweets You have far more going on in your life to be grateful for than a like from silly old me, BUT I am happy to be able to put a smile on anyone’s face :)
@WilliamK1313 @majorov3 @CamdenPulk @JoeJohnsonIce @Adaripp You’d have to look up to rules for your level 🤷🏼‍♂️
@WilliamK1313 @CamdenPulk @JoeJohnsonIce @Adaripp @majorov3 Pick music you love (you have to hear it a lot), and move in whatever way feels good to you. Experiment and play with different moves and movement. Enjoy the process.
That @MichelobULTRA #ASMR commercial did things to me. 😅
@carefreeLA I’m sorry to hear that!
Can we have a moment for that Spongebob cameo moment! That was all I needed today. Thank you for your time. #SuperBowlLIII
When some is good, more is better!!!  The only content I care about today. #puppybowl #puppiesfordays 😍 https://t.co/zy4YxPXEEf
The puppy bowl is the only thing that matters today. 😍 Don’t @ me cause you’re wrong! https://t.co/lMC5tfbPho
@Cathysan I love his music
Rabbit rabbit.  It absolutely blows my mind that 5 years ago today I arrived in Sochi. Those Olympics are still such a fresh memory that I could swear it was only 2 years ago (at most). Can someone slow this ride down just a touch?!?! https://t.co/NhUwwyqCzQ
@WilliamK1313 At the moment I will not be there. Good luck! Just enjoy it. The more fun you have the more fun the audience will have and you will all keep feeding off of each other’s energy. Its a special environment
@lizycoleman @Meryl_Davis @USFigureSkating It is!
Hey @icegirlash what concussion?! That. Was. Stunning!!! So happy for Ashley and Tim! That’s the way you end an event!
@kimber1235 @TarahKayne @doshea213 Busy 😂
I want an infinite replay of @TarahKayne and @doshea213 entrance into that throw triple sal. That was one of the coolest things I’ve seen in pairs!
Well well well if it isn’t @jasonbskates that 3a was a beauty! I enjoyed that. #USChamp19
I loved @TimDolensky short program. Got me off my phone and took me skating with him. Thanks Tim for those 3 minutes!
@Xanboni Which music?!
#USChamps19 I wanted to put in a show for y’all tonight. I think you definitely got one! That was actually so much fun. I wish I could skate more for everyone tonight!!! 🥰
@jillsky431 Nope! Not even slightly lol
Unpopular opinion: I love when it snows a lot
Why do dressing rooms have the most unflattering light in them? You do want me to actually buy your clothes right?!
Attention anyone in, near, or around @AspenSnowmass this coming Saturday we have two Spectacular (😉) shows coming your way! Featuring myself @AshWagner2010 and an incredibly special performance by Olympic Champion @Rad85E! https://t.co/nFIsuQX7bH

Rabbit rabbit 🐰 🐰 Happy New Year!
Well @J_Butt we miss you in Lake Placid, but I have to say our @Pink “Raise Your Glass” opening is one of the most fun show openers I’ve skated in recent memory! 🌟 #myglassisempty 🤷🏼‍♂️
It’s a starsonice show day, it’s New Year’s Eve Eve, and I promised myself I’d do one of these before years end! Still got a few tricks up my sleeve.  #onetake #firstclip #firsttry… https://t.co/1dtL4SMIxF
Love Actually just came on TV and my evening just monumentally improved! 😍 If you wouldn’t have the same reaction, we can’t be friends. Don’t @ me! Lol
Lake Placid holds so much Olympic history. Join us this Sunday at 7:30pm for @starsonice as we bring a little bit of our own Olympic history to this amazing place! #daviswhite #hubbelldonohue #hawayekbaker #wagner #tennell #nagasu #zhou #bradley #abbott #starsonice #figureskating https://t.co/tWfFOfpAaR
@Sk8fanPhil I like it!
Had a dream last night that I was knitting while riding a bicycle. I can’t usually read dreams, but I think this means I need to grow an epic mustache.
@anastasure I’m all caught up and waiting for a new season!
I ordered a lot of sushi, and I am on the final three episodes of The Office. If you need me I’ll be over here bloated and crying.
Headed over to @BrookfieldPLNY for “Stars United” so grateful to @AssemblageNYC for a quiet, calming space to prepare myself before performing tonight! 🧘‍♂️ @ The Assemblage John Street https://t.co/hKs8OObtWp
Who is coming to @BFPLny tonight for “Stars United”? Featuring myself @kaetlyn_23 @Melissagregoryp @DPetukhovOLY @ultranatemusic @divajasonwalker 🙋🏼‍♂️ It will be an amazing show just make sure to bring an umbrella!
Does a song ever strike just the right chord for your day and you have to listen to it back to back at least 10 times?
@KristiMac2014 I wanted to do it all, and I wanted to do it all to the absolute best of my ability. My stubbornness obviously cost me at times, but if I were to do it again I don’t think I’d do it any differently... just better ;) lol
@KristiMac2014 Some is innate, a lot of it was taught (I had amazing mentors &amp; was lucky enough to work w/ some of the best choreographers/ skaters in the sport), but I attribute most of it to integrity. I refused to skate a step that didn’t have meaning or purpose because I needed to jump.
@alyssaaaa21 Don’t tell me that!!! I can’t handle anymore heartbreak! Lol
Sooooo I’ve gotten to the spot where Michael Scott is leaving “The Office”. Two things: Should I be getting this emotional? Should I care about the rest of the series without him?
@alyssaaaa21 Season 7 in two weeks 😂

@3amepiphany Well that joke didn’t land. 🤷🏼‍♂️ I was implying those were a few of my favorite things
@jonas6 If I am it would come as a complete shock to both @Meryl_Davis and myself
@Skinnygreen86 Naw just delirious
@3amepiphany Are they in brown paper packages tied up with strings?!!!
Completely alone in my apartment and thought to myself “Who else here is tired?” *physically raised my hand to answer myself 🙋🏼‍♂️
I’d like to go on record by saying you should ALL be at this show if you can. It will be an AMAZING night to benefit @TeamScottCARES. HOWEVER, if you can’t attend in person you CAN livestream the show for the 1st time ever on ESPN 3!  Just look at this lineup! It can’t be missed! https://t.co/sHZyf8Y6Gl
Yooooooooo! I can not tell you all how excited I am about “Scott Hamilton &amp; Friends” this weekend. This show combines live music from the best musicians in Nashville with skating… https://t.co/hCbR4HtUdp
Just realized, as of last month, my friendship with @JohnCoughlinUSA is officially old enough to drink (legally in the USA)!  @Vegas to celebrate?! 🎉 🥂
@shaelynnbourne @geotro @NickMcCarvel ❤️❤️❤️ No one like you Shae!
I can’t wait to unfollow everyone I know!!! Best. Monday. Ever. #baciodellamorte #imadumptruck https://t.co/nLbvmucKja
@KristiMac2014 Ice dance is very physically taxing on the body as well. There isn’t the jump impact, but it’s certainly no easier. It’s just a different wear and tear on the body. And of course! Thanks for asking questions!
@KristiMac2014 I’ve seen people with non exceptional skating skills become amazing dancers. It’s not necessarily about talent, but it is always about hard work. It you are willing to work hard for a long period of time then you can do almost anything.
Finally starting “The Office”... see you in few days guys 👋🏼
I’m so honored to have “influenced” so many music choices this season 🤪  I hope everyone feels as inspired skating each one as I did ❤️
@bigmouth Could you grace us with a gif. from Season 2 Episode 9 when Lola unfriends Devin? I have scoured the depths of internet for this and cannot find it!

@shoshpd Thank you 💅🏻
Thank you for stopping by for my random thought of the day. You’re welcome
I love it when good people succeed
To everyone in the audience today I must apologize. I skate every step to give you a wonderful experience. I want to give you the best that I have every time. Today was my worst &amp; for that I’m sorry. I will work harder to give you what you all deserve! Always with all my love! ❤️
@JeremyAbbott_FC I gave her mine to hold during practice and they got mixed up.
“Hey Siri what’s the temperature?” ..... “HEY SIRI WHAT’S THE TEMPERATURE?” ..... “𝐇𝐄𝐘 𝐒𝐈𝐑𝐈 𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓’𝐒 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐓𝐄𝐌𝐏𝐄𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐔𝐑𝐄?! 😡” .....  Screw it. I’m just gonna stay inside.
Japan Open is 1 weeks from today! I can not wait to see all you beautiful people! ❤️
I feel that @troyesivan “Postcard” and @ShawnMendes “Lost in Japan” are two sides of the same story.  #thingsthatgothroughmymindwhenicantsleep
@skatefan78 @kathynajimy @BetteMidler @SJP @Diane_Keaton @goldiehawn @YouTube I forgot SJP was in first wives club! EVEN BETTER! Ummm SJP joins the women having been spurned by Bette’s ex. They have a seance to speak w/ Stockard Channing &amp; accidentally bring back the Sanderson sisters possessing SJP &amp; Bette bring back Stockard &amp; Kathy to join Diane! BOOM!
@skatefan78 @kathynajimy @BetteMidler @SJP @Diane_Keaton @goldiehawn @YouTube One of the first wives has vaginal rejuvenation surgery which on a technicality makes her a virgin. She lights the candle trying to romance her love interest. All the women realize they have lots in common &amp; go on an empowering rampage of vengeance &amp; self discovery?! Rough draft?
Truly the reboot / crossover that we deserve!!! @kathynajimy @BetteMidler @SJP @Diane_Keaton @goldiehawn can we make this happen? Even just a sketch for @YouTube? America needs this right now. K thanks! https://t.co/KbRqlQYLLv
@TuktikLiza I’m ready!
Just split the pants of my best suit on the dance floor... we don’t play around here. Go hard or go home!!! #itsmillstime
@LibbyWA @nbc @Adaripp @GraceEGold @TuktikLiza Lol I feel you’d hate this idea!
@christylemire My only concern taking it off nbc is that they own the rights to the footage... I just have to find a way around that. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Let the bidding war begin! Get at me.   (For the record this is now my intellectual property. I have witnesses and times and dates that will hold up in court, so if anyone steals this idea I will be suing!) 😜
Upon further reflection @nbc should keep doing what they are doing, and this new show should run on @FXXNetwork @netflix @hulu @AmazonStudios or another streaming service where @GraceEGold @TuktikLiza and @Adaripp can run free uncensored!!! 🍿🍷😈💅🏻
New idea for @nbc we eliminate all the commentators from figure skating and air all the competitions like Mystery Science Theater 3000 with @Adaripp @GraceEGold and @TuktikLiza  I’m already buying popcorn and programming my DVR!

The last show of Friends on Ice is not yet done, but I can not thank you enough for the incredible weekend of shows. Your support &amp; applause means more to me than you could ever know. I left the ice after all five shows with my heart over flowing with joy. You give me wings! ❤️

@carefreeLA Amazing! What was your favorite part?
@ejslic 🤦🏼‍♂️ oh no! What an embarrassing mess!
@MikeWB75 Congrats!!! What is the focus of your degree?
@CeciliaQuick @ClaireCloutier @skatefan78 Even if you can learn a few basic phrases it will go a long way. Definitely go to Japan though regardless! The food 😍😍😍
@LibbyWA I love London. I only went once for a few days, but walked everywhere and saw so much without even really trying. You’re going to have the best time
@3amepiphany Do it! Skating is amazing exercise and learning even a little bit will go a long way! What are you writing and publishing?
@mfgus I love travel like that! I bet you got some epic pictures
@naganosilver98 Dang! That’s amazing. What are you using to learn the languages?
Happy Monday Fam! What’s been the best part of summer (or winter depending on your hemisphere) so far? What are you all working on? Any fun projects or goals?

@mirrorhands Lol I was probably more confused and thinking you couldn’t possibly be waving at me! Like those times when someone waves at you and you wave back only to realize there is someone behind you they were waving at and you get really embarrassed!
@Rad85E The goal is to make them smile, or feel slightly uncomfortable... not to make them deeply fear for their safety!!! 😂
I love smiling at strangers
@Trish_Tyson @Rad85E Sweet of you to say! My musing wasn’t about me being unhappy w/ who I am or how I was created. It’s noticing the very present sensation of existing in my body, &amp; wondering how that sensation differs from one human to another. It stemmed from a convo w/ Eric thus my final comment.
Have you guys ever taken a second to notice what it actually feels like to be in your own body, then wonder what other people feel like in their bodies? Currently trying to imagine what it feels like to be @Rad85E 😂 #FreakyFriday 👯‍♂️ #conversationswithfriends #randommusings
Rabbit rabbit!  I’ve really been failing at my tradition lately!
Well, I definitely think is was my vote that put @Adaripp over the top. 😂 Congrats Adam for the huge glittery @DancingABC mirrorball shaped cherry on what has already been a dream year for you!!! Always proud of you ❤️
Tonya has been so impressive. I remember watching her as a child. So much power and attack. It’s so cool to see her be lyrical and soft. Then that disco number was right up her ally   💃🏼🕺🏼
Sad that @DancingABC #athletes is ending tonight. Since @mirai_nagasu and @mazdzer unfortunately don’t get to compete tonight then you know my vote is 💯 going to my boy @Adaripp go get em boo!
So @DancingABC has been a dream of mine. Since my Olympic career is over &amp; I may not get that opportunity, I have been living ever so vicariously, &amp; loving every moment, through my friends, competitors, training mates, cast mates &amp; America’s sweethearts @mirai_nagasu &amp; @Adaripp!

Currently in Colorado, there is more snow on the ground than there was when I was here in December, January, and March combined...
@Cathysan It takes a lot more effort than it should!
If you had to describe your 2018, thus far, as a song lyric, what would it be?
@NickMcCarvel @QueerEye Have tissues at the ready for almost all of them
Yesterday, I had to brush my hair for the first time since October... brb still evaluating my feelings on the matter.
I’d just give @PCFclub big doe eyes and ask her to do it 😂😂😂 love you mom
@WeaverPoje and @GeorgiaGlastris better realize how much I love them cause I wouldn’t even put this much effort in for my own mother!
Skipped skating the past two days to deep clean (I mean scrubbing on my hands and knees) my apartment top to bottom. Honestly, I’m sore and out of breath, so I’m calling it cross training!
Listening to @dopequeenpheebs #Sooomanywhiteguys. @ZoeKravitz my grandma also gave me a copy of “Into The Woods” with @OfficialBPeters when I was little! Our gmas are the best.
It’s been longer than I’d like since I’ve performed. It felt so good to be back at home in front of an audience. Thank you @IceSkateWilm for the great weekend! https://t.co/y5JvnN2L35

@Caligirl7998 I did something similar the other day! We have twin bruises 👯‍♀️
@Caligirl7998 This falls hurt so much. I hope you’re ok! BUT If you’re only bruising it once a year I would call that a huge win!!! 💪🏼
Legitimately just did business through social media. Super stoked about it, but man oh man the times we live in... 😅

I hope @ISU_Figure employed construction workers for worlds this year because @wakawakaskate just tore the roof off the building!
Raise your hand if you’re a work in progress 🙋🏼‍♂️
@3amepiphany You’re sweet to worry about me/ hilarious to think I have a life off the internet! I’ve merely fallen into a wormhole of YouTube videos, instagram stories, tinder swipes, &amp; internet stalking @calumscott. Thank you for the reminder that it’s been three days &amp; I need to go outside!
@Xanboni Not at all :)

Nearly 2 am and rather than sleeping, I am sitting on the top step of my stairs, all the lights on in my house, watching old skating videos of myself on YouTube. Anyone else feel this? #retirement #insomnia #weekend
Just got my @Spotify to play through my @AppleTV... I’ve never felt like more of a tech genius in my life!  #technologicallychallenged #oldmanproblems #helpme

Good luck to all the @Paralympics athletes!!! So excited to cheer on these heroes. These men and women are HUGE inspirations. I hope you all tune in! 💪🏼
@WilliamK1313 Well thank you! I’m glad you found something valuable in it :)
@PCFclub @Rad85E Those who live is glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Save your jokes... I know how you text! 🙄

@Adaripp I have a feeling it might be a while 💁🏼‍♂️💅🏼, but I look forward to it all the same. Keep having all the fun boo!

This is so real it hurts. @mirai_nagasu winning or losing, I can tell you that you’re not alone in this feeling! But you’ve got a community of family giving you love and a huge support system. I hope you feel it! ❤️ https://t.co/QoN30hwMZw
@mirai_nagasu Always! 😘
@rj_hutchins But then I’d be advocating for more rules to confuse the crap out of everyone!!! 🤷🏼‍♂️
@rj_hutchins It’s the value of the triple lutz plus the value of the triple toe. In my opinion there should be a percentage increase based off of the difficulty of the first jump. It’s harder to do a triple toe from a triple lutz than it is another triple toe.
@JaneGosford I know! And I’m very proud of it! 🥉❤️💪🏼🇺🇸
@lexypowers Definitely not! It was topical humor. Also I really didn’t start using gifs until the second week making it even funnier.
I finally win something at the Olympics! If you noticed throughout the entirety of the games I really backloaded my gifs! #gifsmatter #bonuspoints https://t.co/ofqhDUXsZX

So much respect for Evgenia! When she saw she was second you could see it crushed her soul, but immediately she stopped, composed herself, &amp; showed true beautiful sportsmanship for her fellow competitors. That was definitely more difficult &amp; equally as impressive as her skate!
Alina just won the Olympics and NO ONE WAS THERE TO HUG HER! SOMEBODY HUG HER!!!! https://t.co/R2rVOorEsv
So happy for Evgenia! Way to come back from an injury to do that when it mattered most to you! Congratulations! https://t.co/ULdyPUvBqf

Carolina will always have my heart! What a career this woman has had! Congratulations on your 4th Olympics!!! https://t.co/JLWai8gUIN
SATOKOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! She just put the pressure on for that medal! That. Was. Stunning. So happy for her! YAS tiny QUEEN! https://t.co/rGaVDzdIvs
Come on tiny queen!
Not the night she wanted, but I loved it! I saw a joy &amp; pleasure in her performance that We haven’t seen in a long time! All the trials &amp; tribulations this girl has gone through the last 8 years; she came out the other side happy &amp; making history! Congratulations @mirai_nagasu!!!

Wow! That was a great triple toe off of a really not so great landing! That takes some strength and a hell of a lot of determination! https://t.co/JWuuXAnAR5
I’m pretty sure Kailani is pretty happy with that! Some things were a little off, but she was not letting any of those jumps go! https://t.co/CF58lQUkGY

Poor Emmi! That wasn’t the way you want to see anyone skate. (Still some really good things in there!) https://t.co/cjkn7FypMJ
Sing it Babs! https://t.co/mUuEj2eks3
Man oh man that triple lutz looked so painful, but the rest of Elizabet’s program was really great! https://t.co/7f0YrYW6R7
Ivett’s skate was a bit of a mixed bag. Some great things, some rough moments, parts where she was connected to the choreography, and moments where she was going through the motions. https://t.co/BNDcBHkZsN
Li had a nice skate. She should be happy! Can’t wait to see what she does with the next four years ahead of her. https://t.co/eHnVsi47AV
@jonp713 I loved the movie! Some of the signing was... (still infinitely better than I could ever do!!! So no hate here) https://t.co/N0inrdCsQe
@jonp713 Are you though?
Kim Hanul shined as bright as her dress. That was great! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So far none of those under rotations that plagued her in the short!
Mae, you’ll never be happy til you try... pretty sure you didn’t try... you did! And that smile shows your great effort https://t.co/Ol0J6CJcPH
@itswhitneymeyer Don’t encourage her!!!
The #Olympics has completely taken over my life! Even my morning commute to #figureskating has turned into a combination of #shorttrack and #skicross
@taiskates Awe thanks Tai! 🤗 https://t.co/M3K5K0Ysq3
@alexabrajk  https://t.co/rkbTQttwoc
@MiliPCar @DarlaCheung Thank you for your civil discourse. I’m not saying she should have the highest TES or the highest PCS, but they should be much closer than they are. The way she skates that program (and in general) should put her in the conversation.
I vote @UzoAduba for #Olympic #figureskating gold! 💪🏼🥇 @OITNB @NBCOlympics https://t.co/L280RexBFV
I know we all love skating &amp; are very passionate! We will have disagreements, and we will definitely see things differently. Some of us will cut anyone who comes for our favorites! We can disagree, but let’s try to keep it civil up in here! https://t.co/LI7LLhZyl5
@Jungle_Jim123 That statement had nothing to do with her placement. Just a sheer appreciation of who she is and what she does!
Watching Carolina skate is like falling in love for the first time. It’s beautiful, it’s special, it’s unexpected, it’s powerful, and it will never be forgotten. ❤️
Be still my heart. It’s time for queen Caro!
Zagitova was solid. Her loop combos can not be touched! I will always bow down to that lutz loop.
This is where I disagree. KO skates w/ enormous speed, jumps higher than anyone, transitions everywhere, plus all the difficulty. She knows how to skate, her edges are impeccable, musicality out her ears. Pure quality. Her short program should be in the conversation for gold.
Love the confidence Kaetlyn has. It’s like, “what?! Yeah I just did that” while landing a triple lutz https://t.co/haKCejJMpH
Satoko knows 👏🏼 how 👏🏼 to 👏🏼 skate 👏🏼 she’s so fluid and her edges are exquisite. She has studied figure skating and her quality exudes that knowledge! https://t.co/kYWSxvhi1z
@kailanicraine We all could tell! Congratulations! 🤗
@JohnnyNicoloro  https://t.co/AtyszxQBCP
Unsurprising skate by Medvedeva. She knows how to produce. Consistency and mental fortitude.
Dabin’s skating is uniquely delicate in this field. I love the lightness and grace of her movements. That was a lovely skate in front of her home audience!
@deborah_ellen Oh I misread which tweet you were replying to! 😂🤦🏼‍♂️ ummm I’d want to look at their technical, but Gabby definitely has her on the artistic score.
@deborah_ellen But the standings they just showed had Mirai ahead. Am I hallucinating? I swore Karen was ahead when her scores first came up. https://t.co/HRhs1urSUR
@deborah_ellen No
Elizabet too! Team Orser is doing a wonderful job molding these skaters. Much more skating quality. https://t.co/tg4bvmTQQO
Karen jumps SO HIGH, the problem is she does most of her rotation as she’s coming down rather than on the way up. That’s why she struggled with that first lutz. The program has lots of quality in it. You can sense she loves her music and the joy of skating to it.
Anyone else stress eating their way through this ladies even too? https://t.co/8FnwLzMO9o
So impressed with how much improvement Gabby has made over the past few seasons. Amazing job Team Orser.
Gabby wins the nail art Olympics
LOVE THIS ATTACK!!!! Just a little too much gas on that accelerator though. Going for that quad axel again! Probably the most connected I’ve seen @mirai_nagasu to the music this season! https://t.co/t1xRHcqKbA
I said that before she skated. I was really hoping I didn’t jinx her! That was a wonderful skate! Technically perfect, and beautifully skated. That’s as good as she could have hoped for 🤗 https://t.co/e1ijsrwBmH
I love when Kaori gets excited!!! Most genuine smile ever!
OMG BB!!! @lindseyvonn there’s no “hopefully”! You HAVE made everyone proud! You’ve inspired generations of skiers and future Olympians alike! #teamusa #olympics #skiing #bestofus #legend https://t.co/nYnahpEugq
I love the counter into that double axel! So cool 😎 https://t.co/v473vyy3qe
Nicole just delivered a lovely, classic, and solid performance! https://t.co/Yky7YydjEe
She just rushed the take off a little. What a shame. That program was so cool! ❄️ @loena_x Talk about upper body movement in that step sequence! https://t.co/CM3OzQf9zQ

@TelmoFe ?
Amazing experience for Mambekova! Having two ladies in this event will definitely help push the sport in their country, continuing the amazing foundation and hard work that @Tenis_Den has already laid out!
Alexia didn’t have the most technically difficult program, but that was so technically sound. Her jumps were impeccable! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@wlft1 Oh definitely!

“That was way too short! I want to see so much more!” - Yuka Sato talking about Piper and Paul. I have to say I agree. That bond program was creative, innovative, interesting, and classy. Purely Bond
Hurtado / Khaliavin are impeccably packaged. They look like a million bucks and after that skate I bet they are feeling like it as well!

@ahlakritz Yup https://t.co/ZkbkSlSYjh
Muse again?!
I found myself completely enthralled with Kana and Chris’s free dance. She looked like a cherry blossom floating gently in the breeze. https://t.co/bIzdPz8caX
@Xanboni ❤️ https://t.co/7nGvETr9hB
@stogba If the skater stops their performance it is apparently a 5 point deduction.
@KristiMac2014 If they stopped themselves they receive a deduction. If the referee stops them I believe they have a predetermined amount of time to fix the problem without a deduction. Anyone please correct me if I am wrong!
Thinking back to last night’s unfortunate incident for Gabrielle, why did the referee not stop them?! Maybe I don’t understand the rules well enough, but I feel like this is a situation in which it is the referees job to protect the skater!!! https://t.co/KheHsIzdKd
@Jimins_Halo 😉
It’s almost time for the free dance! Who’s excited for tonight?!?! #olympics  #pyeongchang #icedance #teamusa  #teamcanada  #teamfrance #teameveryone https://t.co/gImvL7gLP9

@xjuliajkx I mean NOTHING would make me happier!!! I just don’t think it’s possible at this point 😭😭😭
@InsideGym I was super impressed by Kavita and Joti, Kana And Chris, and Piper and Paul as well!
@InsideGym I ACTUALLY can’t pick because some of these guys are practically family! I felt V/M were the best of the night. P/C were right on track until poor thing was losing her top 😥 #teamusa was amazing all around, and IMO that was the best W/P have skated in 2 seasons. It was amazing!
@xjuliajkx Cool! Who are you cheering for?
@realdetective 😂😂😂 https://t.co/44zc8QjwLp

Does Shoma realize he just won an Olympic medal?!?!
Shoma is a fighter like I have never seen!
I wish I could give @javierfernandez that second quad sal! That was incredible!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I AM ON THE EDGE OF ME SEAT!!!! This is a MF sporting event!!!!! I can’t!
Patrick is so beautiful. I can’t. That wasn’t the skate he dreamed of, but my god NO ONE has a mastery of the edge like that man does
I 100% called her out for being rude. I will no longer tolerate rudeness, racism, sexism, or homophobia. If that makes you not want to support me anymore, well you know where the door is. https://t.co/E5gy4pUcYz
Oh. My. God. None of these boys are willing to give up that medal! This is amazing!!!
Well, Boyang is um having a decent night... 😳😳😳
@laurab1433 Oh she was absolutely being rude! I didn’t bother to read her timeline. I just don’t want anyone to take it to a place it shouldn’t go!
@deborah_ellen @ScottHamilton84 Doubles can be repeated. Triples and quads must be in combo.
Huge congrats to @brezinamichal dude! You did it! This was what you fought for. This is what you crowd funded for. This was something you should be so proud of! 👏🏼
Holy hell Adam! He won’t get a medal here but he’s living the Olympics every athlete dreams of! The only thing one can expect of themselves is THEIR best. I think @Adaripp exceeded his own expectations. This was a BEAUTIFUL comepetion for you my friend &amp; I couldn’t be more proud!
@laurab1433 I love the support, but her heritage has nothing to do with this conversation. Rude people exist in every corner of the planet. Neither race, color, nor nationality are a factor here.
VINCENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Holy hell what are these boys doing tonight?!?! I need a team of people to help pick my jaw up off this floor! @govincentzhou #teamusa #bestofus #olympics

I have spent my life allowing shitty rude people dictate how I feel about myself. I’m done with it. I have zero chill right now y’all! To the people who are genuine, honest, uplifting, &amp; supportive I appreciate you more than you know. You are lights &amp; everything I do is for you!
I apologize! I had NO idea I was talking to such a legend! Congratulations on all the Olympics you qualified for, all the records you broke, and all the medals you won!!! You are a real icon and I bow at your feet! https://t.co/GFU08T2BG9
First man to do 6 quads in a program plus a score of 215 in the long... Would you like to take your foot out of your mouth and say that again? #slaythan #quadbae #teamusa #figureskating #olympics https://t.co/BVvelq4uer
@VanessaJamessk8 @JohnWilsonBlade About time! You missed all the people talking about how amazing you guys are, and specifically me talking about your epic hair journey. Congrats on your Olympics. Have so much fun now!
@RealzTenisFanz Thank you
@RealzTenisFanz Telling me I was over scored my entire career is extremely rude! I absolutely know what it’s like to have people constantly tear you down to the point that you no longer believe you’re good enough to achieve your goals. So as I was saying, give the boy time &amp; help build him up.
@RealzTenisFanz Excuse yourself and read the tweet I wrote immediately after that. I am explaining to people the pressure he is under and why no one should tear him apart and everyone should support him! You can check your rudeness at the door and take a seat.
Give it up to Boyang! That was a very smartly choreographed program by Lori Nichol. Perfectly executed. He’s not the most artistic skater, but that played to his strengths and was a very good vehicle to put him in a place for a medal.
That was perfection @javierfernandez I love when people I love fulfill their dreams. ❤️
I’ve never seen Javi this in control. I knew coming into this that he was going to be at his best. I am so happy I don’t have to eat my words! This is so stunning!
Good boy Shoma! That was a beautiful fight 💪🏼 beautiful style and powerhouse technical. This will be a high score!
Nathan is a maverick of our sport and given more experience he will be ready to hold the weigh of the world on his shoulders! For now let’s keep building him to give him that solid foundation to stand on in the future.
To put this in perspective for everyone who doesn’t follow skating. Nathan has only competed at one world championships placing 6th. He’s been paraded as Olympic champion before having competed. That is a HEAVY pressure to hold up when you don’t have the experience to rely on.
My heart is broken for Nathan.
Ummmmm what injury?! Yuzu just showed why he is the reigning Olympic Champion! That was almost too easy. A master of the sport.
Been watching this men’s event since the first skater. My butt is falling asleep!!! This is a commitment. #figureskating

“On a spectrum of @RWitherspoon to @elmo I’m at a Meryl Streep” - @Adaripp 😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/onvXwFE4L2
That last spin Deniss does is really cool! I loved that
Seeing Bychenko killing it like this at 30 makes me want to come out of competitive retirement! Seeing Dima skate makes me want to stay right on this couch...
That was a shame about that triple axel. The rest of Patrick’s skate was stunning. Best quad I’ve seen out of him this season. Beauty.
That. Was. Unreal! 😳 #Dima
Dima’s quad lutz was so good I was certain it was a triple!
How do I think @Adaripp skated? Let me think about it 😉. @IdaCorr_Com what did you think? He’s truly living out his Olympic DREAM! I truly can’t help but admire and respect that! Congrats my friend I am so proud of you! 😘
Man oh man this US team is making history left and right... I can’t even keep up. My head is spinning from all these icons. Congrats @govincentzhou on your mark in the history books for that GORGEOUS quad lutz! #teamUSA
Daniels quads were 🔥🔥🔥 shame about that triple axel! That was clearly a personal victory for him and it was great to see him so happy!
Congratulations @JorikHendrickx that was a stunning short and I’m sure a dream come true. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 those jumps were flawless
Holy cow! @brezinamichal amazing my friend! Best I’ve seen you do in quite some time. Congrats!
Sitting in the ER (for my friend) &amp; just saw the Pairs results... HOLY SH... (you get the idea)!!! @mhjd_85 &amp; @Rad85E ARE INDIVIDUAL MEDALISTS!!!! And ALIONA!!!!!! Aliona &amp; Bruno did it!!!! I am sobbing!!! Holy crap. CONGRATULATIONS! 😭😭😭 #olympics #PyeongChang #figureskating
Had to take my friend to the hospital. Nothing life threatening or crazy, but I know he’d appreciate some positive energy coming his way!
Had a lot of flippin’ fun this Valentine’s Day! I’m head over heels for all you beautiful… https://t.co/nuW50TpU9B
@Cathysan 😂😂😂
Happy Valentine’s Day! Take an extra moment today to spread some love. Do something kind for someone. Tell someone you love them. And if you aren’t painfully single like me then do all of that AND spend sometime with your someone special!  Love you boos! 😘
@idkmybffaliya That is absolutely fine! I mean, you’re wrong, but it’s fine! Lol I’m just messing with you. 😉  To clarify, I dont dislike them! I feel if they could adjust the timing and delivery of their criticism that they could be much much better. IMHO for what its worth 🤷🏼‍♂️
@HollyJollyPaca It sucks for sure! I hate when that happens too, but we likely can’t be mad at them for that because I’m sure that’s someone else’s doing.
@HollyJollyPaca In all honesty though that’s probably the producer talking in their ear that they have to mention him...
https://t.co/smoA2QS9Dk
I apologize if I’m being rude. Tarasova / Morozov really are an exquisite team and their scores will reflect that!
Oops! I was so busy tweeting about Aliona I stopped watching @SeanRabbitt
I don’t care what Aliona gets... its most likely going to be her 3rd Olympic medal in what was it 5 Olympics? Are you freaking kidding me?!?! She is one of the best pair skaters Of. All. Time! (But I hope they can get their goal!)
@tashsparkles Honestly though I didn’t realize he didn’t do a triple either!
Did Bruno really only do a double sal?
Tara don’t say “spunk”
The # 1 problem w/ the commentary is they take a good skate &amp; talk it down so much it loses all excitement. It’s appropriate to explain what wasn’t perfect, BUT they have to create a narrative that excites &amp; engages the audience at home, then explain why they aren’t the leaders.
James*** / Cipres 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ typing too fast and not editing... #doublederp
I MISSED ALEXA AND CHRIS 😭😭😭 how did they skate / what place are they in currently?!?!
I loved watching @valemarchei14 have the skates of her life, in singles, 4 years ago at her first Olympics in Sochi. And now watching her kill it in a new discipline 4 years later with my former roommate (and amazing cook) #Ondrej
In Boca al lupo @valemarchei14 and #ondrej!!!
@bmbrman85 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ this is what happens when you try to tweet really fast and don’t proofread. Ugh
@bmbrman85 On him? Cause I’ll agree
Sui / Han.... WOW! 😶
This google pixel commercial is everything. For obvious reasons... #peanutbutterjelly @wearegalantis
Morgan / Cipres are 🔥🔥🔥 that was awesome! Also shoutout to Vanessa’s hair cause it’s amazing!
@konomu66 Totally understandable
@team_pdd @Debsplaining That might be acceptable.
@guskenworthy Understatement
If @shaunwhite crying didn’t make you cry, you have no soul!!! #bestofus #teamusa #goat
Did not realize I was responding to the Kween herself... AND SHE LIKED IT!!!!! 😂😂😂 I couldn’t be more embarrassed 🤦🏼‍♂️ #derp https://t.co/x9ygB5AYfY
@ice_a_i_ngel 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
@amycinouye Definitely! Always and forever. But honestly one of my faves I ever skated
@rockerskating @MichelleWKwan Rude! 😂 #kween #alwaysandforever
@ice_a_i_ngel I like this 100x
@segsk8 Only ignorant men with fragile masculinity think otherwise
#halfpipe is v similar to #figureskating It’s a judged sport, quads (1440°s) are the topic of conversation, the guys are throwing such hard tricks that we see lots of falls, and they are both amazing, exhilarating, and crazy to watch! #olympics #pyeongchang #teamusa #teameveryone
OUCH!!!!!! I hope he’s ok! 😱😱😱 #halfpipe #expletivedeleted
@MsIngaSpoke No. Not yet anyway lol They all stop after they fall or touch down. I don’t know the rules of the sport well enough. Rather than assume, I figured I’d ask a more knowledgeable audience.
Uhhhh @shaunwhite 🐐🐐🐐 #goat there is a reason #teamusa is dressed like astronauts. I think he actually left the atmosphere #bestofus #olympics
I’m ignorant. Do they stop getting judged after they fall? #halfpipe
@DaniDubs That’s what’s on the live prime time show
Holy crap! #teamjapan Katayama was literally in orbit
This sport is actually insane #halfpipe also damn #ChaseJosey that was a killer run! 💪🏼 #bestofus
I love that all the #teamusa guys made the #halfpipe finals
Come on Joey!!! @jrmantia #everydayislegday
Come on @jrmantia you got this!!! #teamusa #bestofus #olympics
The Olympics are on 4 screens at drag queen bingo. Soooooo none of the medals awarded tonight will matter because I already win the night! 🥇 https://t.co/4hjNlieHAW
During the slow-mo replay of @mirai_nagasu historic triple axel on @NBCOlympics watch @mhjd_85, and all of Team Canada, go absolutely wild with excitement! That’s some gold medal sportsmanship! ❤️💪🏼 #olympics #teamusa #teamcanada #teameveryone #pyeongchang #figureskating
@LutzKlutz1986 They are using the same programs, but they may change the technical content slightly. That will be up to the skaters and their coaches. Also, we will see some skaters perform immensely better while some may not skate as well as the team event.
Damn @chloekimsnow is a boss. Period. #teamusa #bestofus #halfpipe #olympics #pyeongchang
@LibbyWA She’s not my favorite, and there are objectively parts of her skating that need improvement, but so many people spend so much time tearing these skaters apart. I try to focus on ones strengths and if I have criticism I try to make it constructive.
These Olympians are like real life superheroes. Every one of their epics had a starting point. I hope they are inspiring all of you, no matter your age, to get up, get out, and get started on your own epic journeys! #goals #teamusa #teameveryone #olympics 💪🏼
@AbbottSis @Olympics @USFigureSkating I think you’ve got me confused with someone else. That wasn’t me! 😜
@LuluTikhomirova Of course!
@flailingsequins I always forget the brilliance of a well timed gif
Guys... hey all of you... guess what?!  THERE ARE STILL TWO MORE WEEKS OF OLYMPIC COMPETITION!!! #olympics #teamusa #bestofus #teameveryone #pyeongchang2018 #beastmode
@rj_hutchins Kolyada has a much technically harder program (after the first two passes everything was very good quality), but Adam is artistically superior w/ good quality of execution. For me it was close &amp; I think that was reflected in the scores. I could have seen it going either way.
@Mystiquea Lol not at all!
Congratulations to my countrymen, my colleagues, my friends! You were a united team who showed the true strength &amp; heart of #teamusa &amp; now @ShibSibs @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim @bradie_tennell @mirai_nagasu @nathanwchen @Adaripp you are all Olympic medalists!!! 🎉 #bestofus
@Mystiquea Heyyyyyyy 👋🏼
Thoughts on the men part 2: Patrick still looks undermilaged, but the quads were stunning and his skating skills are unmatched. Poor Keiji had a rough go tonight. He has a lot of great quality, and that will no doubt come through next week.
Thoughts on the men part 1: Kolyada seemed to have finally been able to shake his Olympic nerves. Matteo should be so proud of himself. He was fantastic! Adam’s skate outshined his shirt (which is a huge feat!)
Alina’s loop combos are unparalleled. There are a few things I’d love to fix about her skating, but she just 👏🏼 can’t 👏🏼 miss 👏🏼 So much poise and consistency! So impressive
These jumps are work, but her edges and body movement are so impeccable they make me want to quit! Not her best tonight, but that was a good effort.
And now the best female artist to grace the ice this generation ❤️ My always sentimental favorite #Caro
@FrostyLullaby I mean.... I obviously agree 😉, but they are bringing it!!!
The women are showing why they are the marquee event! 💪🏼 #figureskating
I haven’t been watching enough skating the last few years. Gabby has truly upped her skating game. Edge quality, control, and performance quality has all improved immensely!
Kaori is really fighting for this. It’s not the skate of her dreams, but she is showing so much grit to get her job done. Some days are a job and some days are a dream. Today wasn’t her dream, but she did what she needed to.
Watching skating without the music really shows you how good a skater truly is. You see the quality of skating and the performance without being distracted by the excitement of the music.
Literally crying!!! @mirai_nagasu you’re my Olympic hero! #bestofus I’m actually speechless
FLAWLESS triple Axel!!!!!!! Been waiting all season for that!!!!
Come on @mirai_nagasu brb holding my breath!
@liz_anderson29 Love you 😘
At a dinner party watching the men. “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” was playing over Keiji. His program synched up perfectly to the music! 😂 #olympics #figureskating #teamevent #ripwhitney
I met @mazdzer 8 years ago at the White House visit, he was the first athlete I saw when I arrived at the village in Sochi, and I can’t believe I just saw him make history for @TeamUSA!!! First men’s singles luge medal ever! CONGRATS!!! #bestofus #luge #silver #crying #teamusa
@2girlsdancemom @LibbyWA @KurtBrowning Who’s not supporting our athletes?! Nathan had a rough skate. That’s a fact, but no one here (on my feed) has said anything unsupportive! #bestofus
I’m sorry I’m not live tweeting the skating tonight!!! 😭😭😭 I’ll be back at it for the freeskates I pinky promise!!! 😘
I wish I could have live tweeted 50 Shades Freed for you all! It was the feel good comedy I’ve been waiting for all year!
@LibbyWA @2girlsdancemom @KurtBrowning To be fair, every right because it’s not a commentary about what Johnny could do, but about what Nathan was trying to do. We’ve all been on the other side of it. It sucks, yes, but I’d rather be torn apart by someone who’s been through it than someone who has never put skates on!
@felicia__nicole I’m missing luge?!?!?! Nooooooo!!!! These guys are literally the only friends I made between two Olympics! #sociallyawkward #lifelongluger #lugerforlife #sportpuns
@skatefan78 Don’t ruin this for me!
I think I’m finally getting the hang of hashtaging #olympics #pyeongchang2018
Anyone else watching the Hamiltons rock this match? #curling #teamusa #bestofus #hamsibs #lookoutmaiaandalextheresanothersetoficesiblingscomingforyou
@njkggc @mhjd_85 That was probably a question I rented for Meagan! Lol 🤦🏼‍♂️
@njkggc @mhjd_85 They tend to sit in a closet. I’ve loaned some out and sold some others. I’ve had one go to the US Olympic archives and one go to US figure skating museum. The rest I will reuse here and there for shows, exhibitions, etc.
@Rad85E @StacysPitaChips Beet chips! ❤️ you guys were amazing yesterday. So proud of you friend!
@dancernl @gourmetJoyce You should check out @ONEHOPEWINE! @AbbottSis sells it. Delivers straight to your door and 10% of every bottle goes to the charity that bottle represents. Wine and good deeds!
@KristiMac2014 Every Olympic sport is expensive. Very expensive! It’s not a pissing contest just an honest breakdown of what figure skating costs!
@KristiMac2014 Their gear costs a lot, but lasts longer. Choreography, costuming, and ice costs. We pay for ice and coaching by the hour. You don’t have to rent a ski hill by the hour! Lol
@KristiMac2014 The most I ever paid for a costume was $5k (more than 2x what I normally pay) &amp; I only wore it 4 times! They are hand made, certain materials cost more, &amp; Swarovski crystals are not cheap. The more you use the more it costs... also the time put into putting them individually on.
@MsLeaSalonga @JoshPultz Lol I can’t wait to see you in your element!
@jonp713 Lol not huge on that, but Oddly I have decent aim 🤷🏼‍♂️
@mikejenmobile That would open up a lot more opportunity for kids. Even adults. I did it the last 6 years of my career on my own and with not a single endorsement or monetary sponsorship to speak of. If I had a bad season, my funding was cut in half and even at its best it covered maybe 1/3...
Starting my training for #Beijing2022 Nordic skiing or biathalon 😉 #fbf to more wonderful… https://t.co/Z9rcS9cHpn
@coffeeandbars When someone desperately needs a tissue (snot or tears), or when a skater adjusts the front or back panty region of their costume. Lol
@team_pdd Yours is guaranteed to have people in the hospital! Recommending long islands for the team event... many stomachs would have needed pumping just from last night and were only 1/4 of the way through! 😂
I’m all about this @coffeeandbars 😂 except the last one because Bob Costas retired...  #cheers and happy Olympics all! https://t.co/sOI2wAXg7Y
@MsLeaSalonga @JoshPultz Lol you’ve been to karaoke with me! That’s a show in and of itself... is that not the show you’re referring to?! 😂
@jodiecongirl Gold seal revolutions are $647 before shipping. It may have been a liberal use of rounding up, but like close enough? 🤷🏼‍♂️
@deborah_ellen They already have the subs set before the games start, but it’s a close guarded secret that no one can know until the day of! https://t.co/vtIl319xw8
@carefreeLA Hahahaha thanks 😘 and there is LOTS of eye candy at this games. Every day is #thirstythursday in PyeongChang
@deborah_ellen Ummmmm Shibs and Bradie? 🤷🏼‍♂️ Hint: athletes only get one practice a day unless they are in the team event, so if you follow their social media’s closely enough you can tell who’s in the team event and who isn’t. 😉
@JoshPultz @MsLeaSalonga Always! Haha
My parents are quoted here https://t.co/CUq6XF2oHm They really did everything in their power so I could see out my dreams. #thankyoumom #thankyoufella
Dodging this Michigan snow storm to spend some time in NYC. See you soon!
@stogba @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim However, Italy’s teams placed higher than ours so one of our teams got bumped to fit the 18 athlete criteria. (Don’t quote me on the exact numbers. I was just making an example) I hope that clears it up for you!
@stogba @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim Who had yet to qualify their spot at worlds. However the way the results shook out, the countries who qualified at worlds had qualified 19 sk8rs rather than 18. US was tied with Italy,...
@stogba @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim There is a fill up rule for countries qualifying Olympic slots from worlds the previous year. We technically qualified two teams, but only (let’s say) 18 spots can be filled at worlds. The rest are filled at Nebelhorn Trophy, in September, by the countries...
@taiskates @NBCSports 😘
@shoshpd @JustASkateFan I was including that ;)
@SeanRabbitt Yup. Pairs was clearly my calling 😂
I just stress ate an entire bag of @StacysPitaChips watching the men and pairs tonight! Watching on tv doesn’t do this sport justice. Watching live you can feel every emotion and every bead of sweat. Plus there is much less talking throughout! Lol
@kpenner Keep it up! Make sure you’re turning your hips and transitioning your weight. Not only foot to foot but back and forth on the blade as well 😉
@SeanRabbitt HAHAHAHAHAHA I WAS THERE THAT YEAR IN INTERMEDIATE PAIRS!!!! 😂😂😂
@jamiemarich @SeanRabbitt @GraceEGold Yes!!! #goals
@JustASkateFan I haven’t seen it. This is legitimately the most figure skating I’ve watched in 3 years
@kpenner I’d love to work on edges with everyone. Basics is actually my favorite thing to teach. And EVERYONE needs it!!!!!
Jokes aside, last season I thought this team was overrated, but I eat my words!!! Trasova/ Morozov are amazing! I would like to work on edges with them, but really I’m being nit picky.
I haven’t been paying enough attention to figure skating to realize that @SeanRabbitt is a really amazing pairs skater!
@feelingamazing Me too to both!
It’s no less true though. She’s amazing!
@MsLeaSalonga @JoshPultz I definitely will!!!
I didn’t know it was possible but Aliona gets better and better! (I started typing this before she fell)
They have the audience already!
@MsLeaSalonga I’m in Detroit tonight, but starting tomorrow I’ll be in NYC! I’m amazing! How are you? Looks@like your run has been a blast so far!
This is stunning! @mhjd_85 @Rad85E love you guys so much. So so so proud of you! Best skating skills/ performance I’ve seen from you guys. In my humble opinion anyway. 😘
@me_Tessa2 Japanese ski jumper
I’m not sure if it’s my Apple TV or my app or my bloody Comcast but something is glitching and I’m missing skating!!!!! #UNACCEPTABLE https://t.co/Bf8KXUrj0I
Top 5?! They could challenge for a medal is they put it together! They have everything. I’m just not sure they realize they have everything.
@FrostyLullaby @moby_dickhead Chocolate chip. I’m a purist.
@Boo1986 I know I will love it!!! Thank you so much 😊
Actually me the next 2 weeks...  Instead of Doritos and Blue Moon it’s cookies and red wine though.  😂😂😂 Thanks @moby_dickhead for letting me steal this! https://t.co/9aBcyaiy9j
8 Olympics?!?! That is a true legend!
YEAH MURPHY!!! #usa #bestofus
Holy crap!!! Did y’all just see that?!?! #IkumaHorishima #moguls #olympics
@SpunkyRogue24 At least they are being positive and optimistic with him! I was TRASHED by every possible media outlet 4 years ago. Even if you don’t read it, you feel it in the way people interact with you. It’s really shitty. Trust me though when I say the individual event will be different!
Love @alexa_knierim attitude. “We are treating this like a celebration” this is a celebration for you guys! Party it up on that ice. There is nothing like the Olympics!!! ❤️
@gourmetJoyce Food can... wine can not! 🍷
@thedrdenise 😂😂😂
@itswhitneymeyer @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim Matteo stepped off the catwalks from Milan fashion week to Olympic Ice in Korea. (Not really. He’s just a beautiful human being) So impressive to have transitioned to ice so well from roller skates. They both have good edge quality.
@itswhitneymeyer @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim It’s been a looooooooooooooooo......ng time for our pairs, but they 👏🏼 always 👏🏼 skate 👏🏼 so 👏🏼 well!
@TwitniTheGirl @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim I was on my way until she tripped... then I started to giggle. Glad someone else cries at everything too!
Hao Zhang is my hero! Such a dang beast 💪🏼 always solid at any age with any partner!
Yeah @ChrisKnierim @alexa_knierim !!!! Our pairs get a lot of flack, but they ALWAYS show up to Olympics. We may not win medals but they always skate amazing! Go US pairs 💪🏼 #bestofus
YEAH SIDE BY SIDE JUMPS!!!!!!! 🇺🇸
What Johnny and Tara failed to note that Miu has only been doing pairs for less than two years and competed her first international this year, yet they just skated clean at the Olympics... that’s not easy for a veteran let alone a complete rookie!
I’m on my feet!!!!
Go Miu and Ryuichi!!!! TEAM DSC!!!! Beautiful 3lz! My god I can’t tell you guys the HIGE strides this team has made!!!! Ahhhhhh im screaming!!!! They are skating so well!!!!!! 🇯🇵
They look so happy!!!
I missed Kim and Kam because my app glitched. Team Israel is killing it!!! Shame about that step sequence though! Those ones hurt the most because you can’t brace for it.
@crr373 @ScottHamilton84 I respectfully disagree. I don’t think he’s degrading to my sport at all. He’s talented &amp; entertaining. Plus I’m always a huge proponent of one being genuine &amp; expressing themselves. I just feel he &amp; Tara talk a little too much &amp; don’t create a storyline the way Scott &amp; Dick did!
@Skinnygreen86 That is actually correct. Up to this point he has been undefeated this season. He won his Sr. B, both Grand Prix events, the Grand Prix final, and nationals.
@Caligirl7998 I retired from amateur competition at the beginning of the summer. It was a very hard decision, but at 32, having gone to two Olympics, I felt like I was ready to move on. Watching these games is hard though. I want to be out there SO BAD!!!
Hey @ScottHamilton84 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼 missing you in the booth!!!
@kpenner @jonnymoseley My knees hurt by proxy
@teessss you’re a 17 year old Olympic mogul skier!
Love moguls! Remember watching @jonnymoseley KILL it!
@kittysk8s @Rad85E 😂?!?!
@J_Butt No, imma stay in your guest room for the next two weeks so I can watch everyone! 🍻
@jonp713 Plus these guys are raising the bar SO. DAMN. HIGH!!! I’m heart broken for them, but I can’t say I’m surprised! Honestly though, wait til the individual event. The nerves will be shaken off and these guys will be shooting fire! 🔥🔥🔥
@jonp713 I’ll never forget before my first games I was talking to someone from the usoc. He said talking w/ his colleagues they argued that figure skating is one of the hardest sports. We are out there completely alone, w/ such an exact &amp; refined technique, &amp; we only get one shot!
Hmmmm that should be in 1st (by far), but not sure that should have broken 100 🤔
@jonp713 It’s the Olympics! No one can prepare you for what it feels like until you step on that ice. Also, figure skating. We make it look easy, but it’s one of the hardest mental sports to exist.
Atta boy Shoma! Rough night all around, but you got yourself together to keep Japan in the race. You did your job tonight kid!
@margamorenomtz I know boo! 😘 It’s hard coming from the other side. Spectators have a tendency to take their frustration out on the athlete and it’s painful. No one wants it more than the athlete! Decades of literal blood sweat and more tears than anyone ever sees or knows.
Every athlete is in their best physical condition, every athlete is at their peak, but there is a reason the Olympics is only every 4 years and why we put such a big emphasis on it. It’s not just another competition. It’s a very different animal!!!
It took Nathan falling to get them to finally talking! Some of it is necessary and some of it is just obnoxious!
Apparently he skated clean... 🤷🏼‍♂️
@margamorenomtz You couldn’t begin to imagine how he feels!
So no Bychenko then?
@margamorenomtz Angry about what?
💔 the axis was good, everything looked within his reach. Just looked undermilaged. It looks like he got his focus and realized his purpose for competing this season just a little too late. That was an early season skate. So beautiful though! One of the best
Come on Chiddy!
Matteo was lovely. With the exception of the triple axel landing everything seemed light and easy. Nice Olympic debut buddy!
@wagrobanite @nbc I know how money works. Just making sure I didn’t personally screw up! Lol
@MahmficMm8 @nbc I have “basic cable” which includes abc nbc cbs (I think) which makes my internet cheaper, but I don’t have it hooked up. Or just borrow a friends log in!
I don’t have cable. Watching the @nbc app. Have I missed any skating from the live coverage, or is it always a ton of talk and commercials and very little sport? There are only 10 men in this event... show them all!
@jonp713 That’s what I’m here for!
@jonp713 It was the same in Sochi with the addition of the team event
I’m always right! 💁🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/aj1EaYrcyR
Was just at the grocery store and no one seemed to be running to get out of there in a hurry... DON’T YOU PEOPLE KNOW THE OLYMPICS IS ABOUT TO START?! Stop your lives and get to a television now!
Does this games have a hashtag?
@JackieEdous @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @Olympics It’s the team event! #USA 🇺🇸 #bestofus
I effing love the Olympics! (Clearly)
FIGURE SKATING STARTS TODAY! 🎉 #PyeongChang18 @TeamUSA @NBCOlympics @Olympics
I can not believe the opening ceremonies for Sochi were 4 years ago! Walking into that stadium… https://t.co/RNEI7gU8LC
I am admittedly not a regular football fan (I’m ready for your pitchforks and torches), but holy hell that was a great game! And so happy for @MrGoAlexander who’s a lifelong Eagles fan! 💪🏼💥 #worldchamps

@kpenner Ok, well, I was team Nico, but she shut that down HARD!!! 😱 but I’m team Kelli all day!!! 😂 #teamkellilove
It’s official, hockey skates are infinitely more comfortable (and impeccably mounted) than figure skates... @BauerHockey get at me about developing a crossover line!
I present to you the Beijing 2022 Olympic broadcasting team. 😉  (Sorry [not sorry] to keep this going, but this picture was too perfect 👑) @AshWagner2010 @Adaripp @GraceEGold @NBCOlympics https://t.co/uCi2FKfkH3
@kpenner Ugh they are both great and both so flawed. So well written, so human, so many complexities. I’ll have to get back to you!
While I wait for y’all to help me settle that, I’m gonna finish up season 2 of @insecurehbo
What should my next @HBO series binge be?
@janesnage No, that I can actually do!
There should be a unibrow emoji... someone get on this! #nighttimethoughts
@GraceEGold I truly can’t wait!
Bingeing @2DopeQueens and keep hearing the same @audible_com commercial. This woman’s voice is so soothing! But for a company that sells audio books I want you to get me hyped about audio books not lull me to sleep!
@GraceEGold Next time I put myself in that situation I’ll bring you along. I’d love to see how you’d spin me trying to explain to this teenager that I know nothing about hockey skates while explaining to him that I really can skate without saying that I’ve skated in 2 Olympics! 😂
@rj_hutchins In some rental skates that is a MASSIVE achievement! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@realdetective 😂😂😂
@rj_hutchins Absolutely! I’ve managed double loops in rentals. I watched Kurt Browning do double axels. I’ll keep you posted on my progress.
Me trying to buy hockey skates might be the most comical situation I’ve willingly put myself in 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
@tyleroakley Someone finally found a strategy for getting people out to the polls. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
@AshWagner2010 @guskenworthy Thinking I announced my retirement 8 months too early... I’m obsessed with it! (Just not enough to buy it off the rack) 😂
@bornbackwards_ Happy birthday!!! I will see what I can do!

@GraceEGold @AshWagner2010 Can I be the Terry Gannon to your Tara / Johnny?
Just before 5am and I am back at the airport... 😳
@GraceEGold The original tweet has been deleted... what is being clapped at/ who has bad brows (aside from me)?!
Watching a grown man, with a graying beard, belly laugh at the cartoon he is watching... I think we should be friends!
@Skinnygreen86 I haven’t seen it yet.
It’s just shy of 4am and I’m headed to the airport... again. I better make diamond medallion for 2019!
I want to run the @CrashedIce course! This looks like so much fun!
Another successful show in the books! Thank you aspensnowmass for the love, support, and energy!… https://t.co/WGZ5wNxTtW

@mitchislam Wish I could be there! Miss you bud!
The post nationals emotional hangover is always a rough one. #USChamps18
@xhpfanatic ***SPOILER ALERT!!!***
All of our top three dance teams are now National Champions! #uschamps18
Where will this put them? 🤔
The rest is beautiful though!
Those twizzles were a little too cautious
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Literally jumping and clapping!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 so excited for @MadiHubbell and @ZachTDonohue rn. Way to stay vertical! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼❤️ #USChamps18
I loved when @KaitlinHawayek stood up and realized they were getting a standing ovation. The look on her face was priceless! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 #uschamps18
Ok twitterverse... I don’t know about you all, but this #uschamps18 has me spent. I’m not sure I can live tweet this event.  Cut to me five minutes from now https://t.co/2lspsMVz4u
@stacyskates @rossminer Same
@Skinnygreen86 @rossminer Honestly, me too!
@TriciaGrz 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 you get it!
@melipetit Im just speechless by the entire event. I’m emotionally exhausted, I’m excited, I’m heartbroken, I don’t know which way is up. But this is why we have competition! It’s unpredictable and exciting and it proves everyone has a chance to accomplish anything!
Welp.... that was a thing that happened 🤦🏼‍♂️
I repeat BOSS MINER!!!! This is a night @rossminer will remeber for the rest of his life!!! Unbelievable! I am here for all of it! Congrats man. So. Damn. Proud! #uschamps18
Queen and that quad... I’m on board. Nothing else matters! And he’s absolutely killing it so far!!! Yeah @rossminer #bossminer #uschamps18
Come on @rossminer be STRONG 💪🏼
Sitting with @RyanSBradley for this final group. I apologize if you’re sitting near us! This is like cheap therapy
Come what may, in my personal opinion, @govincentzhou was fantastic! I’m rooting for this one! #uschamps18
It’s so hard not being in control!!! So much nervous sweat 😓
Holds breath***... here we go #USChamps18
@googal70 Smart coach
@BeliefBeat @USFigureSkating @BrianBoitano 😂😂😂
I would love to see @TimDolensky do that again in a dimly lit arena with nothing but a spot light and natural light coming through the windows... that program is an experience not worthy of this venue.
I know you guys are nervous... believe me I know!!! But you really gotta start bending from your ankles if you want to make things happen!!!
We’re here (fashionably late) and we’re live! #USChamps18
@azrielen 🐼😂
Lots of good quality and potential there. Still plenty of time to watch Andrew grow! #USChamps18
Loved the moment before the step sequence. For some reason all I could think was “Panders skating club” rather than Panthers.
@BeliefBeat @USFigureSkating @BrianBoitano Thank you :)
@BeliefBeat @USFigureSkating @BrianBoitano I can’t speak for the rest, but I buzzed my head because I had skin cancer surgery in October.
@kwanette LOVE IT! It’s so much fun to do a bit of broadcasting.
@shaelynnbourne @nathanwchen 😘
@tashsparkles I haven’t been invited yet. Keeping my fingers crossed though! I love @starsonice so much, and there is truly nothing in the world I love more than performing for all of you!!!
@tifflangston No! You look amazing!
@jonp713 I’m not a betting man
Y’all don’t have to agree w/ the result. Sentimentally &amp; because she SLAYED Mirai is my champ 4ever, but u HAVE to give it up for Bradie whether u agree or not. She went out there alone w/ everything on the line &amp; did her mf job! These women were out for blood &amp; we got a SHOW!
How’d y’all feel about the coronation of Cinderella? That queen got her crown! #USChamps18
Sorry for the delay. Negative people suck!
First let me clarify... I love when they cry of joy!!! I miss that feeling. When they are sad I completely breaks my heart!!
@wallacem41 @AshWagner2010 @espn No one’s time is over until they decide it’s over!
@Caligirl7998 Don’t be afraid! #getup
I love when they cry!!! I miss that feeling. This competition is always THE best ❤️❤️❤️ #USChamps18
Literally shaking 😭😭😭
Ok I need an hour to recover from @mirai_nagasu!!! #miraiforqueen #tripleaxelbetterthansomemen #USChamps18
So proud of @AngelaWangster!!! You held it together. You skated to Experience, you got experience, and for me it was a wonderful experience to watch your journey here at #USChamps18
Ok @AshWagner2010 you made a believer of this La La Land skeptic! Um also.... that dress... THAT DRESS! That dress is why we don’t wear a uniform @espn 😏 #USChamps18
@jonp713 @MariahSk8rBell @MichelleWKwan @taralipinski I seriously wish @taralipinski could have heard ME gasp!!!
@troglobite_type Wave! 🌊
DAAAAAAMN!!! @MariahSk8rBell How are you gonna skate THAT amazing and miss a double axel?! *cough cough* @MichelleWKwan #uschamps18

@azrielen Fair! I apologize. If anyone really wants to see it I still have it.
*edited* I only made it for 3/4 of an event, but it really took a lot out of me! 😅 Got myself some room service, and @BobsBurgersFOX on tv. Perfect way to spend the evening. Gotta rest up for the rest of the action here at #uschamps18
Retracted that last post... realized no one wants to see a picture of feet near food! 😂
@mylittlebaklava 🤷🏼‍♂️
@TeamUSA Love the gifs!
@azrielen What’s wrong with my arms?! 😭
@flailingsequins 😂😂😂😂😂
@zhonnika Y’all are vicious! Haha don’t think I never followed along back in my day ;)
Hmmm... I have things to say, but I’m not secure enough for y’all to start ripping me apart! 😂 #USChamps18
I keep forgetting to hashtag ### what is the hashtag y’all???
@nathanwchen was great. Saved a little gas in the tank for Korea. Love that program @shaelynnbourne
Jimmy Ma just turned down for what! 🔥
Also, pretty sure @mirai_nagasu was going for a quad axel! That thing was MASSIVE! Proud of all these girls for stepping it up!
Catching up on ladies short. That was a great event, but hot damn @AngelaWangster! Took her time, was in control of herself, did the technical content, and did it with grace, class and elegance... what more could you want! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
San Jose bound. Ready to watch the battle for @TeamUSA figure skating! can’t wait to see what these athletes come with cause you know it’s gonna be amazing! #bringiton #goodluck

@felicia__nicole I'd like to believe I was the inspiration for her dress since I've been wearing that outfit for the last 2 years, but I'm sure she's never seen it. So I guess we just both have good taste! ;)
And just like that I'm in China! It has been 6 years since my last visit and 9 since my last time in Beijing. The smell of the crisp cold air brought great memories of competition flooding back! I am so happy to be here performing with @starsonice ❤️ https://t.co/ztyQezsgYJ

@anpon0113 Onigiri. Ramen. Sushi. Toppo and Koala March. I loved Nikko, but I always enjoy all of Japan!!!
@grierattitude the same as I did before the game. Skinny, fit, but maybe a little softer from not skating for a few days. How do you feel?
@1d_ice_skater I think you can send video here. Or my facebook page
@anumahmed711 probably @AshWagner2010
@saya3848 camo pants a ripped Tshirt and a Nike hoodie

Thank you all so much for your questions!!!!! I had such a blast answering them! You guys are the best! 😘😘😘
@TrinitySperry all of them!!!
@SpunkyRogue24 thrice
@kelseyyyshort hard work. It's cliché but there's no substitute for hard work. Also knowing when to stop! If it's not broken don't break it!
@Bob_Durso I either pick a style of dance, a mood, or a story then find the music, or the music finds me and makes me HAVE to skate.
@dk_alisa Blank space or trouble
@thewongmann I like acrobatic sports
@peachy_peachh listen to music. Talk to my support team (family friends and coaches) think practically and eat dark chocolate Reese's minis
@thewongmann Grand Budapest Hotel was amazing!!!! I haven't seen the rest :-/ want to see boyhood birdman and whiplash
@flailingsequins finished now! You all made it quick!
@grierattitude something that make you HAVE to skate! It touches your heart and moves your feet. Then it's right
@lui_nil there is always someone just waiting to blossom! It's always bright
@manicdani when I find myself I. Times of trouble mother Michelle comes to me. Speaking words of wisdom "let it be" "let it be"
@manicdani "Let it be" from @MichelleWKwan
@Jabbottfan2015 purple vest, silver suspenders, blue paisley shortsleeve, silver leather gloves, and many stars costumes!
@Annabelle_fi I'm hyperventilating I don't know the answer! This one requires thought. I'll be back
@TrinitySperry performance or program?
@dancestuff4321 absolutely
@mfgus working with my brotha from another motha, my sister from another mister, my older clone &amp; dancing half @BenjiSchwimmer / Disneyland!

@dlebovic yes I really am very much so!!! But then I want to stop!
@Cathysan oh I wanted to see whiplash a long time ago!!!
@kwanette amazing coaches, mentors, and RoleModels from the time I was 4 to now! Also figures and ice dance haha
@Lovatic14 the freedom. The athleticism and the artistry. It's allowed me to be passionate about something and make a life doing it.
@MaraAlyseGH IN-N-OUT Burger
@skaterjirik the world! I've been so lucky to travel everywhere because of this wonderful sport that I love so passionately
@Jewels_JW never
@swandie27 I do! I love making risotto. Still waiting for @BrianBoitano to battle it out!
@Flyersmoose lol not sure, but to be on my tour you have to be able to SKATE! No divas and no improper crosscuts
@grierattitude black and blue... Haha I generally see those somewhere on my body as well
@didjershave NOPE!
@carefreeLA haha depends on my mood  or activity.... Generally speaking it's boxer briefs

@Agusaranda23 I've not heard him now I will have to!
@uhmIeah into the woods... (Did I miss my chance already?!) 😳
@Agusaranda23 hi!
@Jewels_JW I do. I never make time for it though. I love Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series.
@maaayyyaaa_ I do not! I wish I did!
@cmbiwer you'll have to ask @GraceEGold or @AshWagner2010 to answer that! but being me is pretty cool sometimes! :)
@uhmIeah uhhhh all of them hahaha
@Googal70 Paris. It's the only place I've ever been where I feel 100% at peace being alone.

@maaayyyaaa_ @Jabbottfan2015 it's dark in here http://t.co/DGuSJqpANU
@gabzam1 good question. I have no idea!!! 😳

@mirrorhands I can watch Spider-Man but I still am arachnophobic
@maaayyyaaa_ I'm not a big country person. I like individual songs
@teruterubouzu not silly quite incredible! Laughter and love got @AbbottSis and I through our father's passing. @CAH kept us laughing!
@KenzyWenzy always varies depending on my mood or the song of the moment
@sacicequeen nope single and ready to mingle. Hahaha
@Fetalized I either start with a style or a story then find the music, or the music finds me and moves me to HAVE to skate!
@teruterubouzu I am so touched! I'm so glad that we could share that joy and it could bring something more meaningful than skating!
@teruterubouzu oh! Well thank you! And really thanks @BenjiSchwimmer and Buddy Schwimmer for that epic program!
@Flyersmoose no office space, but I will do Kung fu panda. #ILOVEKUNGFUUUUUUUUUUUUU hahaha

@uhmIeah Trying to think. There are too many!!! But I'm most proud of Short from Sochi I honestly didn't know I had that strength in myself.
@uhmIeah it was retooling "my swing". Changing technique's a huge challenge but it was definitely 4 the better! Also my nationals exhibition
@CavazosMarijose 2 the rink 2 film me land it. Spent the next 5 session falling so hard. That may have caused the stress fracture in my back
@CavazosMarijose the first time I landed my triple axel I was on the Olympic side of the world arena. I called @MrGoAlexander to come...
@CavazosMarijose I grew up skiing and skating from the time I was able to walk. Thanks @AspenSnowmass
@FrostyLullaby I don't actually... :(
@uhmIeah well I will go anywhere that will have me perform in their shows. (Asia and Europe I'm looking at you guys)
@kwanette I started skating because of @TheRobinCousins growing up I LOVED  Gary Beacom's insane creativity. The man skated on his hands!
@katarinazweng All my best friends are or were skaters. I can't pick just one (publicly lol)
@MaskedbutReal I have been before and it's joyous and excruciating, but at the moment I am not.
@Jabbottfan2015 lol when is it?
@hrhparis https://t.co/tfLbQWkUHU I cried my eyes out too!!!
@maaayyyaaa_ lol when is it? Also I'm almost 30... I don't know that I'd be allowed! Haha

@ashlehdahling I was never built for gymnastics. I made the right choice
@ashlehdahling I grew up skiing and snowboarding, but if I actually ended up at one point having to chose between skating and gymnastics.
@Jabbottfan2015 sure
@princessomega fingers crossed and God willing I'll go to Spain with @WeaverPoje right guys?! wink wink ;)
@FuchsLori for the time being. I'm a citizen of the world with terrible wanderlust.
@jonp713 Seahawks sorry @MrGoAlexander #WorkHardPlayFair lol
@feelingamazing I'm going to say yes. It's a sausage sandwich. Which sounds filthy and that's why we don't call it that! LOL
@kcavery so so many! Do mean performance or program itself?
@Jabbottfan2015 so flattered always!
Anyone have any questions they want to ask? I've got two more hours to go on this flight... 😳 #BlessInflightwifi @Delta @Gogo
I love all the suggestions! Wasn't looking for anything to skate to. Just suggestions for any good music! Love the thoughtfulness though! :)
While on the topic of music. I'm constantly in search of new stuff. Any suggestions (new or old/ any language) of something I have to hear?
Music is everything. It heightens the highs and heals the lows. It builds and creates and constantly moves me forward! 🙌
🎶Je remue le ciel, le jour, la nuit Je danse avec le vent, la pluie Un peu d'amour, un brin de miel Et je danse, danse, danse, danse.....🎶
@realdetective I ain't mad boo. Just thoroughly entertained! Haha
Thoroughly enjoyed watching the man next to me at the gate shamelessly pose for selfies with his selfie stick! #NotDiscreet #ISeeYou lol
