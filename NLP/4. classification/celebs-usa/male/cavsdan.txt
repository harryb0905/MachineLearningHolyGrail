Welcome @Dictionarycom. Some ask why this deal? Words are the vessels of communications btw humans. And digitally, words are the means of exchange of information &amp; intel or the 'currency' of the 21st century.. Our journey begins at the epicenter of the phenomenon. Stay tuned... https://t.co/L1PAorKpg7
OK then, I will be 'terse' and 'brusk', here. One last question...Since @Dictionarycom is the world's official source of definitions, can you please give me the official meaning of the word 'acquired'? https://t.co/DoXvW0tzkE
Gee, @Dictionarycom it is humbling that the world's undisputed official source of definitions of 'words'... which are not only the vessels of communication, but also the currency of the digital age, replied to my question!

@Browns v. @DetroitLionsNFL  ...Hmmmm. I can't win today. Or is it that I can't lose?! Good luck to both sides of Lake Erie.
Not a smart move by Vucevic. Push a rookie from behind while he is mid-air in a pre-season game?

". @halliday_pete: A voice of reason from one who knows nothing about snap reactions. A good time 2 keep your 'IMHO' quiet" So bitter, Petey
Consensus is @browns stockpiling picks for 'franchise' QB in 2014. A bit early for fans to judge this one as painful as it may feel, IMHO
My last tweet confused a few of you.  It was NOT a comment. It was a serious question. So far, no great answers. Seems its still a mystery.
Not much time to follow NFL lately. What motivates @Browns to trade promising 2012 3rd pick for likely 23rd-27th pick? What am I missing?

"@MartyKomertz:@cavsdan half the inside ring of the Q logo is burnt out, facing the west 3rd bridge." We are on it. Thanks for the eyeballs.
CavsFans,you came out on a Friday night&showed your loyal support.Words do not describe how bad we failed tonight.We must & will do better.
"@uhhTurkey: @cavsdan Section 232 Row 7 Seats 9 & 10 are broken. Seats seem to be collapsing" on it. Help on way now.

Really?Our polls show 91% love the unis."@StorkBorn_G: Dear@cavsdan.With all due respect you gotta get rid of these ugly ass wine uniforms"
Now that was an impressive road win.Love watching these guys meld and grow as a TEAM. Defense and coaching led way tonight.And Byron's tie.
Love coach that calls time out on road at any sniff of momentum home team is mounting any sort of comeback from 4th qtr deficit #Byrongetsit
"@cavsdan: @CavsFredMcLeod just gave big props to Byron's tie & shirt combo.Not sure Fred.Looks like he borrowed them from Chris Jent to me.

Fixed. Thanks for your eyeballs. "@samdonnelly: @cavs @cavsdan you guys still have a link to Baron Davis' page on the bottom of the website"
Had we made FT's we would have been on way back to Clev. with the win by now. Still very proud of how these guys battled. Let's get it in OT
Strange.Owned Cavs for 6 years. Had lots of exciting times but never recall actually counting hours to tip like I'm doing now. #excited4team
Cavs 'In Arena Player Intro Video' now live and up on homepage of cavs.com....Let me know what you think....
On it. We'll have it up on homepage today. "@samdonnelly:@cavsdan will this years intro video be posted on http://t.co/iji5C7GN or anythng?"
Samardooooooooooo!!!
CavsFans, I hate losing as much as anybody. This is a process and we must be patient. Not easy but I have zero doubts we are on right track.
Its going to be a lot of fun watching these young guys develop and grow.We are back on the right road.Mission launches in 2 hours 31 minutes
Cavs Fans:"Are You Ready?!".Thank you to the best 'real' fans in the entire NBA for your loyal support.Open video is phenomenal. Can't wait!

CavsFans:Had dinner w/Byron Scott&Chris Grant 2nite.Very positive early feedback on Kyrie,Tristan & camp overall. Looking forwrd 2 tmr nite!
Well, never speak too soon! And all of you Browns fans who are livid...I get it: Browns need an offense. Any offense. I hear yah...
Can Stafford and the Lions even execute a single, run-of-the-mill, normal typical pass play? One? Ever?
"@twithersAP: Browns win coin toss for first time all season." Is this really true?
In downtown Cleveland at Friend's 50th birthday party at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame....This city is on the verge of greatness....Just watch!
Lake Erie success today: Big wins for Browns and Lions...Sorry about the Bills. Would have liked to see The Erie sweep....

Now need the Browns to win or will be a rough Sunday all around....
3 guys rushing and 6 guys blocking and Stafford has no time to throw the ball. Are you kidding me?!
Showing a 'slo mo' replay of a late hit/personal foul in a football game is highly deceiving. Need to see in normal speed to judge the call

You can't make this stuff up! Now its Rays turn....
Rayyyyyyyyy's!!!
Thanks to all 367 team members and guests who attended Isms day at the Book in Detroit today. Enjoyed the crowd &amp; energy. #Ismsinaction
Lions, Browns, Bills all winners today...Love when the Lake Erie NFL teams clean up and sweep...
Still pulling for Rays to snatch the wild card from Boston. Only 1 game back. Who owns the tiebreaker?
Love the Tigers chances in the post-seson..Also, you gotta believe that the Rays are going to overtake the Boston Red Sox for the wild card.
Some of these NBA 'bloggissists' flat-out make stuff up and then try to dupe readers into believing their fiction is real. Sad & pathetic.

Not to pick on NCAA TV,  but why zero fan reaction shots?..Esp after tight game finishes? How many shots of Kentucky band do we need to see?
@_danieljsmith: Got yah Smitty.  I have no interest in libel peddling games, malcontent. Understand there are consequences to your libel.
@_danieljsmith.Are you the Dan Smith of Republic Bank or the libelous Dan Smith from MI who pretends he's an 'intellect'?Gut says the latter
@PFarkas13: Yep tough guy, 61&66 wins was due to bad 'surrounding' talent. Even You KNOW why we stalled. Go back to your lap dog duties.
My thoughts on draft: NBA rules  prevent any comment on players still playing and/or undeclared for draft....And how I wish I could comment!
Also, black paint outside of the sidelines and baselines is terrible on TV. Noticed this at Q last weekend. "Its all about the inches"
What's w/the camera angles in the NCAA tournament TV coverage? Am I nuts or is the primary camera view way farther out than normal? Zoom in!
@joehaden23.Thanks 4 your big time support Joe(& all Cavs fans).Sorry we didn't deliver 2Nite.This pain will continue 2 be our motivation...
How bout' them Lake Erie Monsters?! Another huge win...Cavs hope to learn from your winning ways.....
I am still confused. Kellie is really a man named "Don"? I better get to sleep"@kingF0X23: @KDonhoops Excelnt comebck! I'm a fan & @cavsdan

The 'care' percentage is running about 92.5698% in the affirmative. Never doubted. BTW...We need to step up our defense.  Plain and simple.
Samardooooo is on pace for 54 points at this rate. Would have been higher had he not missed the dunk.  Does anyone care?
Let's be good sports.Be happy 4 your fellow CavsFan.I did say"best Tweet"but didn't say no creative links from twt,etc More tickts in future
And here's the @BShue video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYQ7lJBrcgM

2 courtside seats for 2nite's game to best single tweet on why:   "You are # 1 Cavs fan on planet" Winner announced at 4:00 PM.
Samardoooooooooooo!!!!!!!
Thought: In the history of NBA, how many players went off for at least 23 pts and 10 RB's in the 1st start of their career like Samardo did?
Mo', best of luck to you&your family.Enjoyed having you in Cle. We knocked on the door here but 'fate' had other 'plans'. Be well my friend

Hey Donyell, How yah feeling?!
Thoughts and prayers with Lorenzen's six kids. LW was class act. Respectful to all who worked with him during the year he spent with Cavs.
Dwayne Wade said he will soon thank teams that interviewed him during free agency: "I'll send them all gift baskets or something," he said.
JJ is going to be a monster this year...I believe.
Good luck to you Big Z!  You have always conducted yourself with class, dignity and character, on and off the floor. You will be missed.....
You have to love what highly respected Orlando GM Otis Smith had to say today....http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?playerId=1966
I think that the interest in Isiah in Florida and in college basketball and everything else just keeps the NBA at a higher level.
A new kind of Fathead....http://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2010-06-11-buffalo-head-traps-man_N.htm
The inches we need are EVERYWHERE around us. Just gotta look.
