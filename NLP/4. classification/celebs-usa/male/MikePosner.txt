I spent time writing why I’m actually walking, what tricks my mind will use to convince me to quit, and all the times in the past I’ve shined in the face of adversity. Let’s go.
Drove to big sur cuz I felt like it...spent time in the redwoods with my journal getting my head right for The Walk Across America. https://t.co/RKtl0ozZAS

Move On &amp; Song About You On @AppleMusic’s A-Lists 🙏🏼 @arjanwrites  https://t.co/fxQcCPmQkH
Keep your eyes open today, you might meet a new true friend. Keep your heart open today, you have the chance to be a true friend.
A true friend loves you unconditionally but tells you the truth when you need to hear it.  A true friend will drop everything if you need them to. A true friend is someone you will drop everything for if they need you to. A true friend is home. A true friend is God undercover.
A true friend is rare.  A true friend is more valuable than one million dollars or a diamond ring. A true friend sees who you are AND who you are becoming.  A true friend doesn’t laugh at your dreams, they laugh at the prospect of you failing. https://t.co/u8P0FEpcEV
Watch the whole video.  We keep chasing the next thrill, But what if it’s not that far? What if the first step to becoming perfect, Is realizing you already are.  Song: Perfect from the new album, a real good kid 🎥 by @michaeljenningsfilms and @mikeydones https://t.co/cl8Ss6jUGa

Thank you and Rest In Peace Dr. Dyer. I love you all. Sincerely, mp
Suddenly I felt like I was in the driver’s seat of my own life. I was creating my life. No longer was i a victim to circumstance or chance. My intention, my dedication and vibration are the drivers of my life. Later I found out Dr. Wayne Dyer was from Detroit just like sean &amp; I!
In 2011, @bigsean told me to read a book called Ask &amp; It Is Given by @abrahamhickspublications. In the foreword, written by @drwaynedyer, I read this quote and it changed my life. That one sentence REALLY stuck with me. It was a paradigm shift. https://t.co/yCInwSXAdN

SOME THINGS I LEARNED FROM HIS DEATH: 5. Enjoy this life...chill.  6. There is no right way to grieve  You’ll understand more in a week. If you still have your parents, for me, make sure you tell them you love them and WHY today. Love you all,  Mp
SOME THINGS I LEARNED FROM HIS DEATH: 1. Life is short. 2. Don’t wait to do that thing you want to do, do it now. 3. Don’t wait to tell that person you love them, do it now.  4. Don’t wait to give/get forgiveness, do it now.
SOME OF THE THINGS I LEARNED FROM HIS LIFE: 5. What it means to really show up for your family. 6. Take the high road. 7. You’ll figure it out. 8. Enjoy this life...chill.
SOME OF THE THINGS I LEARNED FROM HIS LIFE: 1. What it means to really love people unconditionally. 2. Always take care of your mother. 3. You never really have to grow up. 4. Sometimes being a man means being soft.
Two years ago today my Dad made his transition. the second slide on this post are the lyrics to track one. This album is dedicated to him. Originally we were going to release today in his memory but it didn’t feel right to me spiritually so we changed it to the 18th. https://t.co/F8pnh3g4QI
