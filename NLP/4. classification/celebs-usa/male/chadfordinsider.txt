Malik Monk, Dennis Smith, Luke Kennard, John Collins all very mediocre in their height to wingspan ratios.
Ntilkina &amp; Donovan Mitchell are intriguing in part because of the big wingspans/hands they bring. Ntilikina w/ 7 foot wing. Mitchell 6-10.
Same with comparing Isaac with Greek Freak.  Anteokoumpo came into league at 6-9/7-3 wingspan and huge hands.
Jonathan Isaac 6-11/7-1 wingspan. Kevin Durant 6-10/7-5 wingspan.  Again, it‚Äôs a major, major difference.  And Durant a much better shooter
Josh Jackson 6-10 wingspan/small hands.  Kawhi Leonard 7-3 wing/enormous hands.  It‚Äôs a big, big difference in success of a player.
Great discussion with a NBA GM about faulty comps of top players in the draft because of disparity‚Äôs in wingspan/reach/hand size.

Mock Draft 7.1: Lakers now have the 2, 27 &amp; 28th picks. https://t.co/IwJRsXyHll
Lakers were surprised about lack of trade value for D'Angelo Russell. No takers in the lottery https://t.co/CLs9xSaNiw
Sounds like the Lakers traded D'Angelo &amp; Mosgov for Brook Lopez and the 27th pick. Wow. https://t.co/vUBjiqCRrJ
This is a disagreement between his agent and Celtics. Don't pin it on Jackson. He's the most competitive/fearless player in the draft https://t.co/NUGKzq7S5f
True. The lack of a workout won't dissuade the Celtics. But the lack of medical info is more problematic for Boston. https://t.co/V9UfS7FnOt
Jackson won't workout in Boston unless the Celtics commit that 1. They're keeping the pick 2. He's their guy at No. 3. https://t.co/k3QcBgnmHf

What should the Lakers do?

If I was Danny Ainge I‚Äôd give the Knicks 3rd pick, Lakers pick and 1 player on my roster (Thomas, Bradley, Smart, Brown, etc.) for Porzingis
With that said, there isn't anyone in this draft that I'd trade Porzingis for.

One big ?  If the Lakers take Josh Jackson at No. 2 (and he‚Äôs strongly in the mix there), do the Celtics do Lonzo Ball or Jayson Tatum at 3?
Celtics have been high on Josh Jackson.  If they get him + another valuable asset or 2 from Philly, it‚Äôs another major win for Ainge
The Sixers-Celtics swap appears like a good fit for both teams.  Sixers covet Fultz. He‚Äôs a perfect fit w/ Ben Simmons &amp; Joel Embiid
Lonzo should meet w/other teams. Only Lakers have his medicals. If LA takes Josh Jackson, he could slide if teams don't have critical info https://t.co/clWjzj8PkV

6 NBA Draft Winners &amp; Losers. Full draft grades coming Friday morning https://t.co/lYkYJXktH7
Only 7 of our Top 60 went undrafted. Utoff (37), Finney-Smith (50), Carter (54), Poythress (55), Payton II (56), Barber (58), Webb (60)
The Jazz select Cal‚Äôs Ty Wallace at No. 60. Was a potential first round prospect last season. Some talent there.
Celtics take Iowa State‚Äôs Abdel Nader at No. 58.  Oklahoma‚Äôs Isaiah Cousins goes to Kings at 59. Another pick I really like for Kings
Grizzlies taking Chinese center Wang Zhelin at No. 57!
Jazz (via Nets) will take UNC‚Äôs Marcus Paige at 55.  UConn‚Äôs Daniel Hamilton goes 56 to OKC (via Denver).
The Cavs (via ATL) are in the draft at 54.  Taking Oakland‚Äôs Kay Felder, who will try to be the next Isaiah Thomas.  Has a chance.
Diamond Stone going to the Clippers in trade.
Nuggets get French PF Petr Cornelie at No. 53.  Another good athlete who can stretch the floor. Solid draft-and-stash candidate.
The Jazz select Weber State PF Joel Bolomboy. One of my favorite sleepers in the draft. Great athlete. Elite rebounder. Plays HARD.
Celtics take Providence F Ben Bentil at No. 51. Big time scorer. Can stretch floor. Again, great value here. Deep 2nd round.
Pacers take Iowa State F Georges Niang at 50 He's one of the most skilled players in the draft. Lots of non-athletic guys making it tonight.
Pistons get Syracuse wing Michael Gbinije. Talented passer and scorer. But already 24 years old. Could be a good playmaker in NBA though.
German forward Paul Zipser goes to the Bulls at 48. Played really well at the Adidas Eurocamp.
Blazers (via Magic) take Maryland‚Äôs Jake Layman at 47.  Great athlete, versatile, just didn‚Äôt assert himself all the time. Solid value.
Sorry, Celtics got Demetrius Jackson, not Mavs.  I‚Äôm tired.
The Mavs take Purdue C AJ Hammons at No. 46.  Lottery talent. 2nd round intangibles caused him to fall this far. Worth the gamble here.
Mavs get Notre Dame PG Demetrius Jackson at No. 45.  Great value here. Has the ability to be a very good back-up PG in the NBA.
4 prospects in my Top 40 still available: Demetrius Jackson, Ben Bentil, Jarrod Uthoff &amp; Isaiah Cousins.
Hawks take French wing Isaia Cordinier at No. 44. Talented. Good scorer.  Just need to be patient.
Rockets taking China C Zhou Qi at No. 43 pick. That‚Äôs perfect. Zhou the best NBA prospect in China since Yao Ming.
Seton Hall‚Äôs Isaiah Whitehead goes 42 to the Nets (via Jazz).  Nets adding some firepower this draft. Like it.
UNLV C Steven Zimmerman goes No. 41 to the Magic
French PG David Michineau to Clippers at 39, Maryland C Diamond Stone to Pelicans at 40.
UNLV‚Äôs Patrick McCaw goes No. 38 to Warriors (via Bucks). Talented point wing ‚Äî exactly the sort of skills the Warriors covet.
Rockets take Chinanu Onuaku at 37.  Great NBA body.  Good defender. Shoots FTs underhanded. Only 19. Like him.
UVA‚Äôs Malcom Brogdon goes 36 to Bucks. Great player. Great passer, good size for position. Could be their Jared Dudley.
Grizz get Rade Zagorac from Serbia at 35.  Big, versatile wing.  Nice draft-and-stash option here.
All 30 in our Top 100 ended up going in the Top 34. The four that fell out were the first 4 pick in the 2nd round.
Suns get Tyler Ulis at 34.  Love him.  He‚Äôs small, but an unbelievable PG. He‚Äôll find a way.
Clippers get KU PF Cheick Diallo at 33.  Really like this pick. Still so much upside there. Plays really, really hard.
Ivika Zubac to the Lakers.  He‚Äôs huge and really skilled.  Nice pick for the Lakers at 32. Ranked No. 25 on our Big Board.
Despite all the chaos, 26 of the Top 30 in our Top 100 went in the 1st.  Deyonta Davis, Cheick Diallo, Ivica Zubac &amp; Tyler Ulis fell out
Grizzlies (via Celtics) get MSU‚Äôs Deyonta Davis. Bucks considered him at 10. Great value for Grizz here.
A record 14 international players were selected in the first round, a NBA record.

Jazz really liked both DeJounte Murray and Malachi Richardson at No. 12.  Grizz loved Timothe Luwawu &amp; Richardson at 17.
Raptors seriously considered Skal at 9.  Bucks looked hard at both Deyonta Davis and DeJounte Murray at 10. Both still on board.
Draft boards from team-to-team were very, very different.  Some teams stunned at who‚Äôs left on the board.  Players they had ranked 10-15.

If Tom Thibodeau really wants Jimmy Butler ‚Ä¶ now is his chance to try to pry him away.  Big 5 minutes for Wolves, Bulls &amp; Sixers

Every year I play the Lottery Mock Draft 1 time on lottery day to predict the outcome. https://t.co/k2AurIKDNX https://t.co/6Vvp38rIh4
If they land No. 3 pick prediction: Nuggets: Bender Kings: Hield Raptors: Bender Bucks: Murray Magic: Bender Jazz: Dunn Wizards: Bender
If they land the #3 pick prediction? Sixers: Dunn Lakers: Trade Celtics: Murray Suns: Bender Wolves: Bender Pelicans: Bender
If Lakers get No. 1? Major debate in front office between Simmons-Ingram. Ingram a better fit. But team leans Simmons b/c of star potential
The Lakers have a 55.8% chance of keeping their pick. However, if the don't get 1 or 2 (38.7% chance), they'll seriously explore trading it
If the Sixers land 1 or 2 &amp; 4 look for them to draft a playmaker &amp; shooter. Could be Simmons-Murray or Ingram-Dunn
The Sixers‚Äô best-case scenario tonight is picking 1st and 4th (if Lakers pick falls to 4). Their worst-case scenario is just No. 4.
Tough news for Onuaku. Glad Combine doctors caught it. Had moved up into a bubble 1st rounder with play at Combine https://t.co/fHsP9lHNu2

NBA GMs &amp; scouts disappointed to learn Thon Maker won't play 5-on-5 tomorrow at Combine. Really wanted to see him in a game setting
In a workout setting Skal Labissiere reminds me a lot of a young Channing Frye. If he can do that in games he's worthy of a Top 10 pick

Oh.  And the Warriors just won their 73rd game, the most in NBA history.  What a night.
58 points? 50 FGs.  Last 15 points for the Lakers.  Lakers take the lead.  Good Lord Kobe.
Kobe going out like a warrior. 56 points. Has scored LA‚Äôs last 13. Leading one last comeback for the Lakers.
With the Nets loss, Celtics No. 1 pick odds will be: 15.6 percent Top-3 pick odds: 46.9 percent
The cost of the Rockets making the playoffs? The Nuggets get their first round pick.

Hard to see Hield getting past Pelicans &amp; Kings (slotted to pick 6 &amp; 7 right now) on draft night. Both teams need what he brings.
Incredible game by Buddy Hield. 29 second half points. Scored 21 of last 25 pts for Oklahoma. Just an amazing season.
Ford-Pelton UK Edition: @kpelton &amp; I discuss Jamal Murray, Tyler Ulis &amp; Skal Labissiere's draft prospects  https://t.co/3zKS0zF122
With UK, Utah &amp; Providence losses, Brandon Ingram &amp; Buddy Hield only guys in our Top 13 still playing in Tournament https://t.co/GA9isogxAG
Kris Dunn's college career is now likely over too. His draft range is 3-8 if he declares. Ben Bentil less clear. Likely 20-35 if he enters.
Jakob Poeltl career in Utah is likely done. Brutal finish for him against Gonzaga but still likely a lottery pick in 6-10 range.
With that UK loss, the No. 2, 11 &amp; 15 players on our NCAA Tournament Big Board are gone. Murray &amp; Ulis off to the NBA. Labissiere?

March Madness NBA Draft podcast with @Lockedonsports on scouting the Tournament. Listen here: https://t.co/IYLk4aguoy
Pope has been awful most of the year. But in last 5 averaging 15 ppg, 6 rpg, 12-20 from 3. Might sneak back into 1st rd on sheer potential
Malik Pope w/ best game of his career today. 19 pts, 12 boards, 3-4 from 3. Several spectacular plays. Looked like a lottery pick today.
Did Ben Simmons' lackluster play damage his chances of going No. 1? I spoke with some NBA folks https://t.co/h5JU4bfrTC
Murray-Ulis best backcourt in college ball. That Murray-Brandon Roy comp feels legit. Ulis amazing, just small. Murray top 4-7. Ulis 20-30
Had a great in-depth conversation with @Lockedonsports on scouting March Madness. Listen to podcast here: https://t.co/IYLk4aguoy
And you can recover from a bad last impression. Andrew Wiggins with 4 points, 1-6 from field against Stanford in tournament. Still went 1
And while Brandon Ingram has gained ground on Simmons, he‚Äôs up-and-down too. Shot 6-for-22 from field in last 3 halves of ACC tournament
Doesn‚Äôt mean Simmons won‚Äôt go No. 1. Most NBA guys thinks he‚Äôs a much better fit in the NBA style of game. Coach didn‚Äôt help him.
This last stretch for Simmons has raised some concerns for NBA folks. Won‚Äôt shoot. Poor defense. Sluggish. Not a great last impression
LSU &amp; Ben Simmons with a dud in final SEC game. 10 pts, 4-11 shooting, 12 boards for Simmons, but passive on both ends of the floor.
Ben Simmons &amp; LSU survive to play on Saturday. Wasn't his best game ... scouts still waiting for him to be more aggressive.

If Lakers finish w/ worst record - 64.3% they keep their pick. 2nd worst record? 55.8% chance of keeping pick. 3rd? 46.9% chance 4th? 37.8%
Disagree. Sixers get No. 1 pick last 2 years &amp; land Wiggins &amp; Towns we‚Äôd be looking at them differently https://t.co/3RfXDHwfcs
Good point. Given the Kings struggles, the changes the Sixers get the No. 1 pick do go up 8.8% in current standings https://t.co/1RSaRnWVSZ

Last game of the night UCLA v UNLV on ESPN2. Freshman big man Stephen Zimmerman the main attraction for NBA scouts
KU's Svi Mykhailiuk w/ a breakout game v Chaminade.  6-for-11 from 3.  NBA scouts hoping to see a lot more of that in the future
Ben Simmons finishes with 21 points, 19 rebounds &amp; 7 assists for LSU. Henry Ellenson with 16 pts, 10 rebounds for Marquette
But saying that Simmons plays like LeBron or Magic doesn't mean scouts think he's as good as those guys. Has a looong way to go to get there
For the record, the Celtics scout was joking. Every team I've spoken with has Simmons No. 1. For most, there isn't a close 2nd...
The good news? Long-time GM w/ great draft record to me: "Anyone who doesn't have Simmons No. 1 should be fired." https://t.co/CxqGYxcsnC
Celtics scout to me: How mad will @BillSimmons be if we get the No. 1 pick &amp; DON'T take Ben Simmons? Bill???
Bad loss for Indiana. Tough, tough game for Thomas Bryant. Got eaten alive down low.  Troy Williams had a really nice game however.
Up next: Indiana v Wake Forest on ESPN2. Indiana has 4 players in my Top 100: Thomas Bryant, Troy Williams, James Blackmon &amp; Yogi Ferrell
Player to add to my Top 100: Vandy's Luke Kornet. Mobile, versatile 7 footer. 13 pts, 7 rebs, 3 assists v St John's. Scouts were impressed
This is the perfect description for the 1st half of this game Myron. Perfect.  https://t.co/vLkJW6207K
Kansas, Indiana, UNLV, UCLA, Wake Forest &amp; Chaminade also here at @MauiInv. 7 players in my Top 30 overall.
Sitting at center court for the @MauiInv 1st up: Vanderbilt v St Johns on ESPN2. Damian Jones &amp; Wade Baldwin in my Top 30.

NBA GM in lottery on why @kporzee didn't go No. 2 in the draft: "Fear plays a bigger role than scouting when you draft that high"
Kansas v Michigan State set to tip off on @ESPN. Not nearly the same draft talent, but two dangerous teams.
NBA scout: "UK's backcourt may have the best two players in the country in it. I'm dead serious." Murray &amp; Ulis earning that praise tonight
UK wins 74-63. Tyler Ulis leads all scorers with 18 pts. Amile Jefferson &amp; Matt Jones with 16 for Duke
UK leads Duke 37-31 at the half. Isaiah Briscoe leads UK w 11 pts. Marshall Plumlee w 11 for Duke. Allen &amp; Ingram combined 0-11 for Duke

Lots of draft content still on the way. Winners/Losers, Draft Grades, 2016 Draft Preview, 2016 Top 100 in next 12 hours ...
Christian Wood, Cliff Alexander, Robert Upshaw, Vince Hunter, Jonathan Holmes, Aaron Harrison, Michael Frazier, Terran Petteway go undrafted
Tyler Harvey at 51 to the Magic! I still believe. Great shooter. Great feel.  Not a great athlete. I still believe.
Christian Wood, Cliff Alexander &amp; Luka Mitrovic only players left on the board in my Top 40.
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson to the Nets. Mason Plumee to the Blazers. Like that for both teams.
Ooops ‚Ä¶ Bucks traded that pick to the Raptors. Norm Powell to the Raptors.  It‚Äôs getting late.
The Bucks were after Norm Powell for a while. Good defender. Great athlete. Not sure how he fits with Vaughn though.
Andrew Harrison got drafted to the Suns.  I like the pick. I think he may be a better pro than college player.
Love Joe Young to the Pacers.  One of the best pure scorers to the draft.
Connaughton to the Nets.  Sorry Celtics fan.  He would‚Äôve been an iconic Celtic.
Josh Richardson sleeper at 40 to Miami. Juan Vaulet from Argentina going to Hornets. Everyone thought he‚Äôd got to the Spurs b/c of Ginobili
Hernangomez is going to the Knicks.  Sorry Sixers fans. Your fleet of bigs are being thinned out.
Darrun Hilliard to the Pistons at 38.  First guy outside my Top 50 to get drafted.
Richaun Holmes a classic Sixers pick. Great athlete. Shot blocker. And ‚Ä¶ another big! He‚Äôll play point guard for them.
Rakeem Christmas going to Cavs? Like this. Ready to play now. Rebounds. Decent rotation big. Like it Cleveland!
Sixers drafted two centers tonight. Philly joining the all 6-foot-10 and over league next year.
Guillermo Hernangomez was teammates with Kris Porzingis. Scouts got lots of looks looking at Zinger.  Reminds me of Zaza Pachulia.
Had Anthony Brown going to the Lakers at 27, just had him at the wrong pick. Best shooter left on the board.
Mickey is a great shot blocker. Just undersized. Never quite understood why NBA teams didn‚Äôt rank him higher. Celtics get rim protector.
Rockets ended up with the 16th (Dekker) &amp; 17th (Harrell) ranked players in my Top 100 http://t.co/bb2I59WJPS
Montrezl Harrell was the highest ranked player to fall into the 2nd. So tough, good athlete. Just undersized. Good pick for Rockets.
Cedi Osman, hands down, has the best motor in the draft.  Guy doesn‚Äôt take a second off.
Cedi Osman was, to me, the best international prospect after Porzingis &amp; Hezonja. Nice pick by Cavs. Big playmaker from Turkey
Keep follow the Draft LIVE on ESPN‚Äôs Draft Cast including my pick-by-pick analysis here: http://t.co/cO6poHfJE5
Guys I projected in the 1st round that are still on the board: Cedi Osman (26), Anthony Brown (27), Montrezl Harrell (28)
Love Looney to the Warriors. Hip injury may hold him back temporarily. But lottery talent there. Could be steal of the draft.
McCullough to the Nets was done a month ago. He drops because of his injured ACL. Had he stayed at Syracuse, may have been lottery in 16
R.J. Hunter to the Celtics is a great pick. Great shooter. The Celtics need that. I know @kpelton will give them an A.
Larry Nance Jr. an interesting choice. Versatile. Great athlete. High basketball IQ.  Raptors looked at him at 20. He dominated workouts.
Milutinov the 1st draft-and-stash pick of the draft. Cavs would‚Äôve taken him if they didn‚Äôt trade. Classic Spurs. You‚Äôre on @franfraschilla
Jarell Martin is an interesting prospect. Good athlete, good body, stuck between positions. Needs to stick at the 4. Nice pick for Grizz
Flip Saunders has been after Minn native Tyus Jones since pick 18. Nabs his at 24 in trade with Cavs. Cavs get 31 &amp; 34.
Co-signed https://t.co/89orPp5pg1
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson is my sleeper in the draft. Love this pick for the Blazers. Best wing defender in the draft. Upside is Iguodala
Surprised Bobby Portis fell. Does everything well. No huge holes. Amazing motor. Love the pick for the Bulls.
If Justin Anderson shoots anything near the 45% from 3 he shot at UVA this year, he‚Äôs a steal for Mavs. If he‚Äôs closer to 29% as a soph?
Cameron Payne, Terry Rozier, Jerian Grant and Delon Wright (to Raptors) all go ahead of Tyus Jones.  I support that.
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this. Kris Porzingis &amp; Jerian Grant? I‚Äôm loving the Knicks draft.
Knicks get their point guard in Jerian Grant. Hawks get Tim Hardaway.  Winner? Knicks.
I‚Äôm a Dekker fan.  Still think he has a better career than Kaminsky.  Time will tell ...
Rockets take Sam Dekker.  He‚Äôs the next Chandler Parsons for them.  I like it.
Vaughn one of the best scorers in the draft.  Can shoot it and get to the basket. Bucks needed some of that. Just have to be patient.
Terry Rozier is a smaller version of Marcus Smart. Tough, athletic, defends his butt off.  Just not a great shooter and not a pure PG.
Oubre is heading to the Wizards for 19 and future picks. There‚Äôs first draft trade of the night.
Kelly Oubre has star potential. But he‚Äôs got a lot to learn. Have to be patient. But if he puts in the work, could be a star.
So much for all the trade talk. No trades in the lottery that we know of.  That may be biggest surprise of the night.
With the 14th pick, the Thunder select Cameron Payne. Thunder have been connected to Payne for months. Major potential. Like it.
That future first going to Raptors comes from the Clippers. Protected 15-30 from 2017-19.  https://t.co/XffWqXOPCD
With the 13th pick, the Suns select Devin Booker.  The Suns really needed a shooter. This is a good pick for Suns &amp; Booker.
With the 12th pick, the Utah Jazz select Trey Lyles. Such a Jazz pick. Solid, not sexy.  Reminds me of a young Boozer.
Turner has the potential to be a stud and I love Frank Vogel as his coach. Just not the ‚Äúhelp now‚Äù player I thought Indy would draft
Surprised Pacers passed on Cameron Payne. But after David West opted out, I think they felt they had to go big. Good pick, but need patience
Winslow to Miami is great fit for him. He‚Äôs a Pat Riley type player all the way.  Sometimes it pays off to fall a bit. He‚Äôll thrive w/ Miami
Here‚Äôs the problem with replacing your front office right before the draft. Vlade &amp; Karl had never seen Mudiay play. Mudiay &gt; WCS
With the eighth pick the Detroit Pistons select Stanley Johnson. With Justise Winslow on the board. First big mistake of the night.
With the seventh pick, the Denver Nuggets select Emmanuel Mudiay. Such a steal at 7. Great pick for Denver.
For my pick-by-pick analysis, follow the Draft LIVE on ESPN‚Äôs Draft Cast here: http://t.co/cO6poHfJE5
With the sixth pick, the Sacramento Kings select Willie Cauley-Stein
With the fifth pick, the Orlando Magic select Mario Hezonja, Croatia
With the 4th pick, the New York Knicks select Kristaps Porzingis, Latvia
The triple towers: Okafor, Embiid, Noel.  At least one won‚Äôt have a long-term future in Philly.  Embiid or Noel the more likely to be moved
With the third pick in the draft, the Philadelphia 76ers select Jahlil Okafor, Duke
With the second pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, the LA Lakers select D‚ÄôAngelo Russell, OSU
With the first pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves take Karl-Anthony Towns, UK

3. If the Kings pass on Willie Cauley-Stein, he could be in free fall. I think Pacers could pass at 11. Could go 13. Could go 21.
2. Frank the Tank is on fire. Phil Jackson loves him. So does Vlade Divac. Michael Jordan won't pass on him at 9. 4-9 his new range.
1.  Trades could dramatically shake-up the draft order. Lakers, Sixers, Knicks, Magic, Kings, Hornets, Pacers all talking trades

With the 24th pick the Cavs select Bobby Portis, Arkansas (the steal of the draft, no way he lasts this long) #FordBilasMock
With the 22nd pick the Bulls select Rashad Vaughn, UNLV #FordBilasMock
I‚Äôm still a believer in Looney by the way.  With Caboclo and Looney at forwards, the Raptors will be crazy long. #FordBilasMock
With the 20th pick, the Raptors select Kevon Looney, UCLA #FordBilasMock
With the 18th pick, the Rockets select Jerian Grant, Notre Dame #FordBilasMock
Was praying that Payne would be there for the Rockets at 18 ‚Ä¶ gotta think about this one ‚Ä¶ #FordBilasMock
Bucks just traded for Michael Carter-Williams and Tyler Ennis to play the point, not sure where Payne fits at 17. Value pick? #FordBilasMock
Can you imagine a Marcus Smart-Hollis-Jefferson backcourt. No one could score on them. And they couldn‚Äôt score on anyone #FordBilasMock
With the 16th pick the Celtics take Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Arizona #FordBilasMock
Oh man, more pressure.  No I‚Äôm selecting for the Mormon GM.  What say ye Celtics fans? #FordBilasMock
With the 14th pick the Thunder select R.J. Hunter, Georgia State (shoutout to @kpelton) #FordBilasMock
Frank Kaminsky is a good fit in Phoenix.  I‚Äôm not a fan of his, but Channing Frye thrived there &amp; I think that‚Äôs his comp #FordBilasMock
Jazz fans didn‚Äôt like Oubre pick. Sounds like they want Lyles. My 2nd choice was Looney. I may get kicked out of the tribe #FordBilasMock
With the 12th pick, the Jazz select Kelly Oubre, Kansas #FordBilasMock
So much pressure. Why does the Mormon always get the Jazz‚Äôs pick? #FordBilasMock
LOL, just had a NBA GM text me asking me to make sure I made a good pick for them. Get to work! #FordBilasMock
And who backs up Whiteside and Bosh? And is Whiteside a sure thing? And is Bosh going to be healthy? https://t.co/AQzXZjKoTW
Myles Turner is underrated.  Elite size, rim protector and stretches the floor. In two years you‚Äôll thank me Heat fans #FordBilasMock
With the tenth pick the Heat select,  Myles Turner, Texas #FordBilasMock
Charlotte is the worst shooting team in the league. Might be a reach for Booker, but have to concur w/ @JayBilas here #FordBilasMock
Spoken like a true guru! https://t.co/dP662M2JB1
With the eighth pick the Pistons select Mario Hezonja, Croatia. Love, love this pick for Detroit #FordBilasMock
I think Winslow to the Nuggets is foreordained.  He‚Äôs there on every mock draft on the planet and has been for months. #FordBilasMock
A Boogie Cousins-WCS could be a disaster, or the greatest thing ever.  Since I don‚Äôt have to live with it, I‚Äôd love to see it #FordBilasMock
Sort of. Don‚Äôt call. Just use Twitter for that.   https://t.co/dfZKquT5RS
With the sixth pick, the Kings select Willie Cauley-Stein, UK #FordBilasMock
With Elfrid Payton &amp; Victor Oladipo already in the fold, the Magic take Mudiay at 5 @JayBilas? #FordBilasMock
With the fourth pick, the Knicks select Kristaps Porzingis, Latvia. Let the boos rain Knicks fans ‚Ä¶ #FordBilasMock
What do you say Knicks fans? With Okafor, Towns &amp; Russell off the board, who should I take at 4? #FordBilasMock
Sixers drafting Russell makes a lot of sense @JayBilas, but I still feel like Porzingis has the most upside at 3 ‚Ä¶ #FordBilasMock
Landing Towns would be a dream scenario for the Lakers. They‚Äôll settle for Okafor if Towns goes 1, but Towns is their target #FordBilasMock
With the second pick in the 2015 Twitter Mock Draft, the Lakers select Karl-Anthony Towns, UK #FordBilasMock
Okafor goes No. 1? @JayBilas you just made everyone in LA so happy.  You‚Äôll get an invite to the championship parade in LA #FordBilasMock

Yeah. The Celtics are the most logical trade partner for a Hornets deal.  https://t.co/vbOAsEcEDv
Hornets also like RJ Hunter a lot, but won't take him at 9.  It's possible they trade down a few spots for Hunter &amp; pick up another asset
With Lance Stephenson gone &amp; Spencer Hawes on board, chances Hornets take a 2-guard like Devin Booker or Kelly Oubre at No. 9 just went up
Such a shame. One of the risks in the workout process. Enjoyed talking to him in Chicago.  https://t.co/IO6YGzyWTt

International players of note who WILL stay in the draft? Porzingis, Hezonja, Guillermo Hernangomez, Mouhammadou Jaiteh, Cedi Osman

Russell does everything well. Shoots it. Great handle. Very intelligent. Super impressive competitor.

Here‚Äôs Mock Draft 5.0: Towns to Wolves, Okafor to Lakers, Russell to Sixers. Picks 4-30: http://t.co/5ogMYNEkNZ
Karl Towns was an 81% free-throw shooter. Okafor 51%. That‚Äôs a big deal to scouts after watching D‚ÄôAndre Jordan/Dwight Howard hack-a-thons
Agree with this Myron. Both are very good picks. Ditto for Russell, Mudiay &amp; Porzingis. 5 legit No. 1 candidates.  https://t.co/NFQhkYp6pk
Expect the Magic, Kings, Pistons and Hornets to seriously consider trading their picks.  All 4 want to accelerate rebuild
The Knicks will talk trade with everyone &amp; are also big Justise Winslow fans. Not sure they‚Äôre sold on Mudiay ...
If Towns is gone, Lakers like Okafor, but also need Russell‚Äôs shooting
Wolves genuinely torn between Towns and Okafor ...
So much still up in the air as we head into the last month of the draft ‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs here! Mock Draft 5.0. Towns goes No. 1 to the Wolves. Frazier II goes 30 to the Warriors. http://t.co/5ogMYNEkNZ (in)

The LA Lakers will be selecting at No. 2 in the 2015 NBA Draft

I always write that Bobby Portis does everything well, nothing great. Need to revise that. Portis' motor is great. Always goes hard.
Exactly. I'll be surprised if he's not a lottery pick after workouts. Imagine if he had Devin Booker's looks at UK https://t.co/Q1VwtrghNd
RJ Hunter shot 19-25 from NBA 3 in drills. Sam Dekker went 16-for-25 in same draft workout here in Chicago.

NBA teams are telling Cal that Johnson is likely a second rounder. But Calipari has sounded pessimistic that Dakari will stay at UK.
Big ? mark is Dakari Johnson. John Calipari has been calling NBA folks all week to gauge his draft stock according to sources.

Tough game for Sam Dekker. As @kpelton predicted today, his 3 point shot reverted back to the mean. Not as dangerous when shot not falling
Duke wins despite subpar offensive games from their 2 best players &amp; lottery picks Okafor 10 pts on 5-9 shooting Winslow 11 pts 3-9 shooting
Exactly RT @IOHJCHSAV: Waiting for @KingJames tweet saying Jones should go 1st overall in draft‚Äù
Thought Tyus Jones would return to Duke. After this game, no longer so sure. NBA guys love PGs who play big in big games (see Shabazz)
@kpelton Tyus Jones has been great. Not Grayson Allen great, but great nonetheless
And you'll have Tyus Jones in the Top 5 RT @kpelton: By the end of the night, @chadfordinsider is going to have Grayson Allen in the lottery
Nigel Hayes 8 pts, 2-2 from 3.  Another big game off bench for Grayson Allen: 6 pts, 2-4 from field.  A late lottery to mid 1st pick in 2016
Dekker 8 pts, 5 Rebs, 2 assists, 4-9 from field. Winslow 7 pts, 1 reb, 1 steal, 3 blks 2-6 from field.
Okafor 6 pts, 2 rebs, 3-5 from field. Kaminsky 7 pts, 7 rebs, 1 steal, 1 blk, 2-5 from field.

RT @KyleTucker_CJ: Cal says Booker and Dakari the other two potentially leaving.
RT @KyleTucker_CJ: Calipari says Cauley-Stein, Towns, twins and Lyles likely to go.
Ford-Pelton: Justise Winslow &amp; Sam Dekker go head-to-head tonight. @kpelton &amp; I debate their NBA potential  http://t.co/MND4Rwostv (in)
Okafor-Kaminsky a good match-up but 1 that has NBA folks drooling is Winslow-Dekker. If Dekker awesome again, draft stock bumps up again
RT @KyleTucker_CJ: Cauley-Stein: "I know what I'm doing. It's time to take another step. Probably my last game here."‚Äù
NBA GMs/scouts bummed no Towns-Okafor head-to-head match-up on Mon. Probably helps Towns who's moved ahead of Okafor on most NBA boards
For UK Towns &amp; Cauley-Stein very likely head to NBA. Lyles, Booker &amp; Harrison twins likely gone too. Johnson, Lee, Poythress, Ulis ? marks

Kawhi Leonard is a good comp for Justise Winslow.  Michael Kidd Gilchrist as well, though Winslow a better 3 point shooter.
Justise Winslow, like Dekker, has helped his stock in the tourney.  We moved him to No. 6 on our Big Board last week, might be too low.
Porzingis had 18 points on 8-for-18 shooting (2-for-4 from 3) &amp; 5 boards. Hezonja played 6 minutes &amp; scored 0 points in a win for Barcelona
Hearing a number of NBA GMs &amp; scouts traveled to Spain this weekend to see Barcelona v. Sevilla (ie. Mario Hezonja v. Kristaps Porzingis)
This --&gt; RT @SynergySST: Willie Cauley-Stein is allowing only 21% shooting defending in one-on-one situations on the perimeter this season
Signature game for Towns RT @ESPNCBB: Karl Towns finished with a career-high 25 pts for UK. Had more FGs than rest of UK starters combined.
Willie Cauley-Stein‚Äôs end-to-end defense on Jerian Grant on last possession? That's why scouts believe he could guard all 5 positions in NBA
That. Was. An. Epic. Game. Karl-Anthony Towns saved UK's season.
And somewhere @kpelton &amp; all of my analytics friends in the NBA are saying ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù on Dekker. They loved him since his freshman year
Dekker has been ranked as high as 18 &amp; as low as 25 on our Big Board this year. He should be pushing the high end from here on out
No one's helped their draft stock more this tournament than Sam Dekker When he shoots like that &amp; plays w/ that swagger he's a lottery pick

If D'Angelo Russell can light up Rondae Hollis-Jefferson &amp; Stanley Johnson on Saturday, his argument for the No. 1 pick will strengthen
D'Angelo Russell was sooooo special against VCU. 28 pts, 4-7 from 3. Played like a senior.
Yup. Everything about it was perfect RT @BaxterHolmes: Gotta be one of the best moments in tourney history: https://t.co/lwtjhS4Hhy

Tyler Harvey vs. Georgetown in the 1st round.  I‚Äôm going with Harvey.  And NBA scouts stoked UCLA made it. More Kevon Looney!
East bracket not loaded with elite NBA prospects. But watch Providence‚Äôs Kris Dunn ‚Äî he‚Äôs generating serious buzz as potential lottery pick
Poor KU. After playing the toughest schedule in the country, they have to get past Wichita State, Notre Dame &amp; UK to get to Final 4. Yikes
Of those teams, Notre Dame has the best shot of knocking off UK. Like their guards better than UK‚Äôs. But Auguste is in for a long night.
Kansas, Notre Dame and Maryland crying right now. Got stuck in Kentucky‚Äôs bracket.   Brutal.
Tyler Harvey shoots 44% from 3 and 47% on 2pt jumpers. No he doesn‚Äôt. RT @jesseleman: he has a terrible shot selection...
Good news NBA draftniks @EWUAthletics just won. We‚Äôll see draft sleeper Tyler Harvey at the big dance http://t.co/nV2ZY2WItO (in)
If Jackson keeps playing like this against Duke &amp; in the Tournament, he‚Äôll rise FAST on the Big Board. Scouts love his mid-range game

Emmanuel Mudiay's great China experiment is over.  What's next? A run for the No. 1 pick: http://t.co/cJdvqGs4lx (in)
In 12 games Mudiay averaged 18 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 5.9 apg, shot 51.4% from the field, 34.2% from 3 &amp; 57.4% FTs.
With Guangdong's season over, Mudiay will return to the US and begin preparing for the 2015 NBA draft.
Emmanuel Mudiay has 15 points, 7 rebs, 8 assists, 6 TOs on 5-14 shooting in a loss for Guangdong today. His season is over.
Mudiay scored 17 first half points coming off the bench. He started the second half. Pretty amazing for an 18-year-old.
Mudiay had 24 pts, 8 rebs, 4 assists, 2 TOs. He shot 6 for 15 from the field and 2 for 4 from 3.
Emmanuel Mudiay played his first game since Nov. 23rd in China a few hours ago.  Helped the Guangdong Tigers avoid playoff elimination.

LeVert is a NBA talent‚Äîa wing who can see the floor &amp; shoot Assuming he‚Äôs healthy for pre-draft workouts, still should land 1st rd/early 2nd

No one was drafting McCullough expecting immediate results. Could still be seen as a value pick in late 1st, early 2nd if he declares
Teams haven‚Äôt shied away from taking players with torn ACL‚Äôs in the 1st before.  But obviously this hurts McCullough's draft stock this year
Tough break for McCullough &amp; Syracuse.  RT @syrbasketball: Chris McCullough has torn his ACL and will miss the rest of the season.

Celtics own Nets pick outright in 2016. Owns Cavs if falls between 11-30. Owns Mavs if it falls between 8-30 in 2016.
Mavs pick now likely to go to Boston in 2016 (Celtics get if 4-14 this year). Celts could have 4 No. 1s in '16. Their own, Nets, Cavs &amp; Mavs
Brandan Wright is underrated. Ranks 5th in PER in the NBA this year w/ a 26.19 ‚Äî ahead of Harden &amp; LeBron.
That 10th pick, which Boston owns, is likely to get better as Celtics clearly headed toward the tank now.  22nd pick via Mavs may get worse

If KU is going to comeback, they'll need huge 2nd half from Oubre &amp; Alexander. Only 2 Jayhawks who can match UK's talent right now.

UK 38- KU 28 at the half.  Oubre leads all Jayhawks scorers with 6 pts despite playing just 7 minutes. Andrew Harrison leads UK with 7 pts.
Kelly Oubre played 4 minutes in KU's opener.  He's starting tonight. Every scout in the gym just let out a huge sigh of relief.

If Karl Towns plays like this all year, he‚Äôs got a shot at the No. 1 pick. 19 pts, 10 rebs, 3 asts vs. Chalons-Reims today. He‚Äôs special.
So impressed with this Kentucky team in the Bahamas. Playing without WCS &amp; Lyles they still look so deep, huge &amp; unselfish.

The Philadelphia Assets RT @darrenrovell: Epic @PhillyDailyNews cover this morning http://t.co/3LEqpuB3OR
Going on @SportsCenter to give my draft grades right now.
My NBA Draft Grades. Cavs, Bucks, Jazz earn A‚Äôs. Raptors? Not so much. And what the hell Philly?:  http://t.co/90itljb9ZH (in)
Here was my live pick-by-pick analysis of the draft: http://t.co/WOKVlOLlT7 Draft grades coming later tonight
Top undrafted guys: Patric Young (36), Artem Klimenko (39),  Khem Birch (42), Bryce Cotton (49), CJ Fair (54),Jahii Carson (55),James McAdoo
Bucks will get a future 2nd for that pick they just sent to the Hawks.
Russ Smith won‚Äôt go to Philly.  They‚Äôll move him to New Orleans for Pierre Jackson, Smith‚Äôs clone from last draft.
Lamar Patterson will be traded to the Hawks.  The Bucks moved this pick to Atlanta.
The Bucks have traded the 48th pick to the Atlanta hawks according to sources.
That Markel Brown pick will actually go the Nets.  The paid for it.  He‚Äôs a great athlete and he defends. Bit of a tweener.
Pistons took Spencer Dinwiddie at 38.  Should‚Äôve left him in my mock at 38.  He was there all week.  Shucks!
Bucks took Johnny O‚ÄôBryant at 36. Raptors take DeAndre Daniels at 37
Grizzlies will send the Jazz a 2016 2nd round pick for the draft rights to Jarnell Stokes.
Stokes was another guy that ranked very high in analytics models. Grizz clearly still watching the numbers.
Sources: Jazz selecting Jarnell Stokes at 35 for the Memphis Grizzlies.  This is a trade.
Knicks select Cleanthony Early with the 34th pick.  Nice pick.  May get tons of time if Melo leaves.
Cavs select Joe Harris with the 33rd pick.  Got a very good shooter here.
Sixers take KJ McDaniels with the 32nd pick.
LOL RT @steve0040: Was he a Sixer fan?RT My editor, 1 minute after 1st rd ends "Hey Chad, can you send me your 2015 NBA Draft preview ‚Ä¶ now‚Äù

My editor, 1 minute after 1st round ends. "Hey Chad, can you send me your 2015 NBA Draft preview ‚Ä¶ now.‚Äù #nosleeptonight
I know @franfraschilla is not a big Inglis fan. But Bucks see a little Kawhi Leonard in his game.
Inglis is a sleeper. Athletic.  Huge wingspan. NBA body. Bucks will bring him over right away.
The Milwaukee Bucks will select Damien Inglis with the 31st pick
Anderson is the perfect fit for the Spurs.  He‚Äôs the next Boris Diaw.  Best possible fit for him.
The San Antonio Spurs will select Kyle Anderson with the 30th pick.
Huestis was the guy who helped shut down Andrew Wiggins in the NCAA tournament. Tough, physical, athletic defender.
The OKC Thunder will select Josh Huestis with the 29th pick.
The Clippers will select CJ Wilcox with 28th pick.
The Suns will select with the Bogan Bogdanovic with the  27th pick.
With the 26th pick the Charlotte Hornets select PJ Hairston with the 26th pick (via Heat)
The Houston Rockets will select Clint Capela with the 25th pick in the draft.
LeBron James really wanted the Heat to get Napier.  Pat Riley flew out to see him right after Finals
We reported this potential Napier to the Heat deal yesterday http://t.co/SnO3uGcdiy
Sources: Shabazz Napier traded to Miami Heat
Napier will be traded to the Heat according to source
The Charlotte Hornets select Shabazz Napier with the 24 pick in the draft.
The Utah Jazz select Rodney Hood with the 23 pick in the draft.
Adams was one of the top scorers and analytic prospects in the draft. He also can‚Äôt dunk in games.
The Memphis Grizzlies select  Jordan Adams with the No. 22 pick.
The OKC Thunder select Mitch McGAry with the No. 21 pick.
Cabaclo has a 7-7 wingspan and can really shoot the ball.  Trying to be the next Greek Freak? Worked for Milwaukee.
.@franfraschilla says Caboclo is the Brazilian Kevin Durant. Masai loves these projects.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs 2 years away from being 2 years away.‚Äù- Fran
The Toronto Raptors will select Bruno Caboclo with the 20th pick in the draft.
The Denver Nuggets will select Gary Harris with the 19th pick (via Bulls)
As we‚Äôve been reporting, the Suns have been hunting for PGs.  I think they‚Äôre keeping this pick. Will they keep Bledsoe?
The Phoenix Suns select Tyler Ennis with the 18th pick in the draft.
The Boston Celtics select James Young with the 17th pick
The Denver Nuggets select Jusuf Nurkic with the 16th pick (via Bulls)
The Atlanta Hawks will select Adreian Payne with the No. 15 pick.
The Phoenix Suns will take TJ Warren with the 14th pick in the Draft.
The Minnesota Timberwolves will take Zach LaVine with the 13th Pick
Interesting, the Sixers won‚Äôt have either Embiid or Saric this year. Saric unlikely next year too. Tank City.
The Orlando Magic will take Dario Saric and will send him to 76ers for Elfrid Payton.  So ‚Ä¶ sort of right about Saric to Philly
We were talking about Nuggets-Bulls trade for weeks. Bulls wanted shooter and saves around $900k in cap space
Source: Nuggets will send McDermott to Bulls for 16 and 19
The Denver Nuggets select Doug McDermott with the No. 11 pick.
Wow ‚Ä¶ messed that up.  Philly took Elfrid Payton ‚Ä¶ at 10..
The Philadelphia 76ers take Dario Saric with the No. 10 pick in the draft
The Charlotte Hornets will select Noah Vonleh with the No. 9 pick.
The Sacramento Kings will select Nik Stauksas with the No. 8 pick.
The LA Lakers will select Julius Randle with the No. 7 pick
The Boston Celtics select aMarcus Smart with the No. 6 pick in the draft
The Utah Jazz will select Dante Exum at No. 5.  Who they were hoping for. ...
The Orlando Magic select Aaron Gordon with the No. 4 pick in the draft
The Philadelphia 76ers will draft Joel Embiid with the No. 3 pick.
The Bucks plan on playing Jabari Parker at the 4 and Giannis Antetokounmpo at the 3 source said. What both Bucks &amp; Jabari wanted all along
Source:  The Cavs will keep Andrew Wiggins. They did not draft him to trade him.
The Milwaukee Bucks will select Jabari Parker with the No. 2 pick.
The Cleveland Cavaliers will take Andrew Wiggins with the No. 1 pick
The Cleveland Cavaliers are on the clock ...

As we reported in our Mock 20 minutes ago, Vonleh sliding. In the mix at LA or Philly. (I put him at 10 to Philly in last mock)
We have Dante Exum going 4 to Orlando. But hearing Aaron Gordon strongly in the mix there at 4. If Magic take Gordon, imagine Jazz go Exum

Updated Mock Draft 10.1 getting ready to drop soon.  Lots of tweaks based on intel today ...
Re: Reports that Cavs are asking for 3, 10 &amp; 32 from Sixers for No. 1. If Sixers tanked all year for Wiggins, they have to say yes, right?
Why Bucks should take Exum over Jabari RT @ESPNInsider: The #NBAFrontOffice has decided: Give us Exum at No. 2 ¬ª http://t.co/nGzFK703D6 (in)
Should the Cavs keep or trade the No. 1 pick? @WindhorstESPN, @LegsESPN &amp; I debate on @SportsCenter http://t.co/kBTcgP8rcu
Here‚Äôs Klimenko‚Äôs player card: http://t.co/sqOdGM5gMc
One name to watch for Rockets at either #25 or #42 ‚Äî Russian big man Artem Klimenko.  They‚Äôve been doing a deep dive researching him
Note the Magic at 4 or the Celtics at 6 or Lakers at 7 could select Smart. Just don‚Äôt get the feeling he‚Äôs a top any of their boards.
And if Kings pass on Smart ‚Ä¶ where does he land? Charlotte at 9? Philly at 10 (even if they take Exum)? Orlando at 12?
If Elfrid Payton has moved ahead of Marcus Smart on Kings board, that‚Äôs an amazing rise.
So if Mem-Tor deal goes through (&amp; sounds like a draft night decision), Raptors would end up with both Ennis at 20 and Capela at 22 ...
Raptors will consider Capela at #20, but think it‚Äôs increasingly likely that Tyler Ennis will fall to them there. Ennis &gt; Capela
On Mem-Tor deal @ESPNSteinLine reported. Look for Raptors to target Clint Capela at 22. Spurs were hoping he fell to 30.
Here‚Äôs our NEW Mock Draft.  Will be updated throughout the day as new intel/trades go down. http://t.co/VUJek3PuER (in)
The Arron Afflalo deal to the Nuggets essentially ends Magic bid for No. 1.  Will the Cavs keep the pick now?
Heading onto @SportsCenter to talk NBA Draft now &amp; again at 10:30 AM ET.
Dante Exum has declined to fly to Cleveland for a workout today according to a source
Magic would take Jabari at 1 I'm told.  But deal isn't done. Cavs were just gauging value of 4th &amp; 12th pick. Sixers also upping offer for 1
James Young was in a minor car accident. Caused him to miss his last 5 workouts. He's OK. But may explain his recent draft slide
Sources: Cavs were calling around offering teams Orlando's picks at 4 &amp; 12 for players last night. Interesting
RT @ESPNWestPalm: Guests on @MikeAndMike: @ramonashelburne 610, @ESPNSteinLine 730, @chadfordinsider 810
Sources: If Bucks, Magic, Jazz or Celtics move up to No. 1 ‚Äî Jabari is their man. If Sixers move up it‚Äôs for Wiggins.

FWIW alternative McGary theory I‚Äôve heard: McGary may WANT to fall to the 2nd round so his agent can control $ and years of his contract

This no surprise. We reported months ago Saric was going to Efes. Still several top NBA teams are bummed. Wanted him here now.
Saric's draft stock will likely take a small hit. He was projected at No. 12 in last mock.  Will fall to 17 to Celtics in our newest one.
The deal will essentially prohibit Saric from playing in the NBA for a minimum of two years the source told ESPN.

The picture of Andrew Wiggins vert jump floating around? His agent, Bill Duffy, told me it's a 44 inch vert.
Randle and Vonleh with identical speed and agility scores. Both solid for their position. Gordon clearly the best athlete of the group.
Aaron Gordon continuing to wow. 3.27 3/4 court sprint and a super quick 10.8 sec lane agility drill.
Patrick Young with a very good 37.5" max vert.  #NBACombine
Alex Kirk, Alec Brown and Jordan Bachynski can jump higher than Jordan Adams. Yikes.
So Gordon 39", Vonleh 37", Randle 35.5". All good numbers for bigs.
Noah Vonleh with a 37" max vert. #NBACombine
Julius Randle with a 35.5" max vert.  #NBACombine
Aaron Gordon has a 39 inch max vert. Terrific for a player his size. #NBACombine
Aaron Gordon just jumped so high they had to raise the vertical jump apparatus.
Yep. New Mock on Tues RT @grosenstein: "I think he'll leapfrog Julius Randle and Aaron Gordon." - @chadfordinsider on Noah Vonleh just now.
Tyler Ennis posted the second fastest modified lane agility score in the #NBACombine  Is he still unathletic?
Here's the latest Ford-Pelton. Does the NBA Dragt Combine still matter? Yes and no.  Here's why. http://t.co/YyYm3oWFId (insider)
The #NBACombine moves to ESPN2 for the next 2 hours. Come join us!

Tyler Ennis with a 36 inch max vert.  Pretty good actually for all the knocks about his athleticism #NBACombine
Dante Exum with a 10.75 sec lane agility drill score. Ran a 3.19 second 3/4 sprint. Both scores top among all 2 guards he's testing with.
Gary Harris sitting out athletic testing. Has a minor groin pull. Should be good to go in a week.
James Young with a 35.5" max vert. CJ Wilcox with a 37.5" max vert.
Nik Stauskas with a 35.5" max vert. Nick Johnson with a 41.5" max vert.

NBA Draft Stock Watch: who helped their stock at the first day of the #NBACombine http://t.co/A9ZSFrT9Bq (insider)
Jordan Adams with a terrible 29.5 inch max vert.  That's really bad for a guard.
Dante Exum with a 31.5 standing vertical and a 34.5 inch max vert. Good, but not elite.
Highlight of the #NBACombine for me. Spending a few minutes with my favorite KU player of all-time Jacque Vaughn!!!

Now Capela has his 4th foul. Good news is he grabbed a rebound &amp; dished out an assist in those extra 3 minutes.

Huge win for UK. Best I‚Äôve seen Kentucky play all year. Harrison twins, Randle, Young, Cauley-Stein, Poythress all played great.
Don't overreact twitterdom to those Jabari tweets. He'll be a Top 4 pick. Just explaining why most teams are fearful of taking him No. 1.
He had 3 fouls. Not 4. RT @Ctice90: weren't they subbing Parker out because he had 4 fouls?
Jabari's poor defense is nothing new. Biggest reason he's never been No. 1 on our board. But not the last impression you want to make.
NBA scouts killing Jabari &amp; Rodney Hood defensive efforts today. What does it say when Coach K has to sub you out on defense against Mercer?
Jabari Parker ends a stellar freshman season with a opening round loss in tourney while shooting 4-for-14 from the field. Will he go pro?
Should Wiggins go No. 1? I say yes, he's the next Paul George. @kpelton says  no, he's Luol Deng. http://t.co/K7wTHqf9Ts (insider)
Adreian Payne with a huge 41 pt game today. One of the few stretch fours in Draft. More big games could make him a lock for the lottery.

OKState wins 78-73. Smart with 18 pts &amp; 3 asts on 6-13 shooting. Dinwiddie with 18 pts &amp; 3 asts on 6-14 shooting.
OSU leads CU 32-26 at half. Smart w/ 9 pts on 4-6 shooting. Dinwiddie w/ 4 pts on 2-6 shooting. Smart missed last 7 min w/ foul trouble
Scouts also watching OSU's Markel Brown, LeBryan Nash and Colorado's Josh Scott
Lots of the scouts here on the fence about Dinwiddie as a prospect. Could really help his stock w/ a great performance against Smart
About 25 NBA scouts here in Vegas for OK State/Colorado. NBA GMs Neil Olshey (Blazers), Dennis Lindsey (Jazz) &amp; Gar Forman (Bulls) here.
Oklahoma State vs Colorado up next on ESPN 2. Great PG match-up between Marcus Smart &amp; Spencer Dinwiddie
Alex Kirk and Kendall Williams are the prospects for New Mexico. Jamil Wilson, Davante Gardner &amp; JaJuan Johnson for Marquette
In Vegas tonight scouting a couple great games. New Mexico-Marquette up first on ESPNU
Terrific games today for Julius Randle (29 &amp; 10) and Joel Embiid (17 &amp; 8) today. Wiggins struggled offensively again, but a force on defense
Bubble 1st rounder RT @ESPNAndyKatz: PJ Hairston done at North Carolina, Tar Heels not seeking reinstatement:  http://t.co/fueXWedAtY
Another great game for Jabari tonight. 23 pts, 9 rebs, 5 asts.  LaVine really struggled in 2nd half. Was pressing too much.
Jabari is such a lethal, versatile offensive player. Think he'd average 18-20 ppg in NBA right now.
GMs here tonight include: Danny Ainge, Bob Myers, Masai Ujiri, Billy King, Kevin Pritchard
Game tied 37-37 at half. Jabari leads all scoters w/ 11 pts. LaVine w/ 5 pts. Hood w/ 6 pts. Anderson w/ 7. Adams w/ 6.
That's what I'm talking about with Zach LaVine. Wow
45 NBA scouts in the house tonight
Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood, Rasheed  Sulaimon for Duke and Zach LaVine, Jordan Adams &amp; Kyle Anderson prospects to watch for UCLA
