@karaswisher Its a separation of powers. Royalty in Thailand has real power, unifying even more power in the monarchy comes with litanies of issues.

3/ Customers can then easily share the referral link with their Facebook friends and earn rewards through @smilerewards if their friends purchase from the shared link. https://t.co/xSzKPaQ9wk
2/ With @smilerewards + @OctaneAI, #ecommerce brands can transform happy customers into evangelists and customer referrals -- automatically. When a customer purchases products from a store, they will receive a referral link in Facebook @Messenger. https://t.co/kYUUR1pFFl
1/ I‚Äôm THRILLED to announce @OctaneAI and @smilerewards have partnered to create the first ecommerce loyalty integration for Facebook @Messenger!!!  Connecting https://t.co/LporZJ19tf‚Äôs rewards platform to Octane AI has been one of our biggest customer requests. https://t.co/O15i4Wbo51

@bentossell @stripe I don't know the specific context of the posts so can't quite say.
@bentossell @stripe But the US federal laws on marijuana when it comes to banks and money are VERY strict (marijuana businesses cannot even have bank accounts in states where it's legal) and the current administration would sue for sure.
@bentossell @stripe I understand their positiom. It‚Äôs a federal crime if they accidentally sell marijuana and they want zero risk of getting sued. zero tolerance policy makes sense  That said, would Stripe stop working with Twitter because a user posted a tweet proming marijuana? Of course not.
@taps That would bring up a lot of uncomfortable questions if I were.  (Now I miss my baby niece.)

7/ Crazy fact: More merchants and businesses signed up for Octane AI last month than üî•IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE COMPANY!üî•
6/ Word has been spreading quickly about Octane AI. What has differentiated us from the market has been 1) our ecommerce features; 2) our advanced @Shopify flows; 3) our automated support functionality; and 4) Our integrations with @Yotpo, @Klaviyo, @gorgiasio, @Yext and more. üôå
5/ I want to thank the Octane AI team, especially our engineering team and @meganberry for making the Affiliate Program possible.
4/ We also offer special bonuses for creating educational content about @OctaneAI, signing @Shopify merchants up for the Octane AI Pro Plan, and switching merchants from an Octane AI competitor.
3/ Premium Partners and top performers can earn thousands of dollars per month from our Partner Program. It's serious money.

I was lucky enough to visit Mrs. McVety on a recent trip to my home town and catch up with her and let her know the level of impact she had on me. But I am still saddened that I will never get the chance to drink tea with her again.
The impact she had on my life is incalculable. I would not be here without her. She was even the one who gave me my favorite book as a teenager: Ender's Game.
Elaine McVety was my AP History, social science, and art history teacher at Princeton High School. But more than that, she taught me work ethic, speed reading, determination, and most of all, she gave me a passion for learning.

I‚Äôm excited to support @CrazyRichMovie this weekend. As a half-Asian American, this kind of representation is important to advancing more Asians in Hollywood. Also it‚Äôs a 96% on @RottenTomatoes!

@Suhail @abargmann Hipchat and Slack are remarkably different in their stickiness and usefulness. That‚Äôs why Atlassian did the almost unpredented move of completely giving up on the market.   It‚Äôs different if you start a company now vs 5 years ago. But also the right email culture can work.
@Suhail @abargmann I didn‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt work. I suspect it does. But stripe was also started before the Slack era which is a factor.   Also plenty of multi billion dollar companies using Slack too. I guess it‚Äôs just one size doesn‚Äôt fit all. But slack fits a lot of feet.
@Suhail @abargmann I‚Äôm seeing people choose companies based on the tools they use. I know if were on the market not using Slack would affect my decision to join or not join. Email list sounds archaic from the outside.
That‚Äôs a ludicrous drop. https://t.co/iTyBaDfpl4

@Biggearl69 @Lebeaucarnews @CNBC It‚Äôs Elon‚Äôs fault this time, he‚Äôs the one who called one of the hero divers a pedophile.
5/ @elonmusk shouldn‚Äôt be let off the hook for his awful comments this weekend. I hope he takes time to reflect and become better.
4/ His best move is to take a break from Twitter. Focus on his companies and himself. It worked for @pmarca, who is another brilliant soul who saw his blind spot before it caused damage to his form. I hope Elon does the same.
3/ Elon is indeed brilliant, and I do believe he has the world‚Äôs best interests at heart, but this success has given him blind spots. He cannot see the damage he is doing to himself, his company, and to some extent the world.
2/ People are scared to critize Elon because of his easy trigger to outbursts, his fanatical audience, and his success. But none of these things should stop us from pointing out that his Twitter behavior is unhealthy, unproductive, and as of this weekend, uncivilized.
1/ @elonmusk crossed a horrible line today that I never thought he‚Äôd cross.   Calling someone a pedophile because they criticized you is way beyond the pale. Doubling down and saying you‚Äôd bet a dollar it‚Äôs true is even more maddening.

@matt_odell @lufthansa 3. How the hell is Bitcoin's energy hogging a feature? You're literally wasting finite natural resources on computations. Cryptocurrencies like chia have found ways to mine coins without the energy cost.
@matt_odell @lufthansa 1. Not in every instance everywhere in the world. Bitcoin sucks up energy that could be put to better uses in other parts of the world.  2. I think Ethereum is a superior evolution of bitcoin, and i love what Chia is doing. Bitcoin, being first, has unforseen shortcomings.

@AdamSinger @pt @jmj Only during the purge.
@AdamSinger @pt @jmj I mean how do you define success? By the metrics they‚Äôre tracking (amount invested), they are 100% successful at raising huge amounts.   As businesses, no, none are successful and raising waaay too much for their size.
@AdamSinger @pt @jmj Careful of using absolutes. Lots of regulars ask me or are excited by blockchain. Some do know their economics. There are legit uses of blockchain.   It‚Äôs just that the vast majority are scams/greed grabs.
@pt @AdamSinger @jmj Very successful. Target their audience well. Just because you don‚Äôt see it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt work.

4/ I implore you to embrace your journalism bonafides, @iamjohnoliver, instead of being afraid or ashamed of it. We need all the journalists we can in these hard times. You can be both comedy and journalism.   /Rant
3/ You don't have to be trained at a journalism school to be a journalist. I had no formal training when I was named Mashable editor. But people relied on me for reliable information and analysis. Just as people rely on you and your team for knowledge.
@iamjohnoliver @AmPress @brianstelter 2/ This is what your show does. Just because your journalism is wrapped in comedy doesn't mean you can or should deny that you employ a team of journalists.   It does journalism a disservice that you're ashamed or afraid of admiring you and your team are journalists.
1/ @iamjohnoliver I don't mean to pick a fight, but it's a bit insulting you don't call what you and your staff do journalism.   Defined, by the @ampress: "Journalism is the activity of gathering, assessing, creating, and presenting news and information."  (Cc @brianstelter) https://t.co/6puMAqcNLR

@Katie_Roof @mporat @hblodget @jrichlive @joshelman @alexia Yep, Katie, I'm just your backup. :)  The fact a company supposed to hit some kind of Goldilocks zone (5-10% pop) on IPO day is insanely, insanely archaic.
@mporat @hblodget @Katie_Roof @jrichlive @joshelman @alexia When a price is barely up, underwriters are likely keeping the IPO price afloat.   IPOs are an outdated mechanism of capitalism and could be vastly improved.
@mporat @hblodget @Katie_Roof @jrichlive @joshelman @alexia Everyone seems to be forgetting that the price could have gone down a bunch more if it weren't for the underwriters. Without that effort, the stock would have gone down on IPO day.

I don‚Äôt expect Travis to leave Uber, especially now. The best CEO changes happen with stacked management rosters. Uber‚Äôs roster is bare.
@danprimack He‚Äôll especially think this with the leadership roster so bare. Rightfully so too. Easier for CEO to leave with full management roster.
@danprimack @danprimack He gets the value of his shares whether he's there or not because of his common shares. So what do you even mean here?

@davidfolkenflik @united I have.
@naval I wish I had thought of this tweet.
@annebot @WBMason @united In conclusion, fuck United and its shitty service and its terrible treatment of this situation.
@annebot @WBMason @united The passenger is not blameless, but United clearly fucked up and made bad decisions and is not sharing in the blame or responsibility.
@annebot @WBMason @united - You should not be defending a giant multi-national corporation that clearly does not have a shred of empathy.
@annebot @WBMason @united - United should not have issued a tone deaf response. - United‚Äôs CEO should not have put blame on the customer even if he were to blame.
@annebot @WBMason @united - He was ignoring unfair directions. - He should not have been knocked un-fucking-conscious.
@annebot @WBMason @united - United should have offered more to passengers instead of using security. - United called security. There it removed the man.
@annebot @WBMason @united That‚Äôs insane. Even if the passenger was belligerent, his treatment and United‚Äôs tone-deaf response were dead wrong.
I have status on American. I have status on Delta. I have status on Virgin America.  Anything but United.
