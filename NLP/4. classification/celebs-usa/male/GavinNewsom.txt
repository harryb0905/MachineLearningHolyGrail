Rural counties in California face some unique challenges when it comes to homelessness and wildfire preparedness. That's why I went to Grass Valley to meet with folks and talk to them about the issues central to their communities. https://t.co/FsgKsnLqt7
It's long past time this political theater over a manufactured border crisis came to an end. California is not standing by as the President misuses our National Guard troops. https://t.co/McqFRbvBtQ
This administration finalized its gag rule — which dismantles Title X, attacks health centers like Planned Parenthood, undermines patients' rights, and dangerously restricts access to life-saving health services. We cannot let them get away with it. https://t.co/fj0sV45XYm
San Francisco lost a dedicated public servant last night in Jeff Adachi. He was a passionate fighter for fairness and led the charge on progressive criminal justice policy. He will be greatly missed.
We have an administration that continues to reject the reality of climate change. We must demand immediate action on this threat from the federal government. https://t.co/l20MfKnMv3
The Trump Administration‘s choice to push a made-up “national emergency” and ignore the real crises that face our nation is beyond reckless. We cannot continue to reject the reality of climate change.  https://t.co/bLBO4FV6Zh https://t.co/9R811Pl6BS
This administration continues its political charade by targeting our state and cutting off negotiations on clean car standards. California will not stand idly by as the President and his allies attempt to put the health of millions at risk. https://t.co/Goxjg8d7UP
Climate change is real. The evidence is all around us — and the consequences of inaction are deadly.  Enough. The time to act is NOW. https://t.co/66HFyXNTJt
Here in California, we work closely to solve big problems — from tackling climate change to keeping families together. We're proof that government can do good work for ALL people and thrive. I see why the President doesn't like that. https://t.co/aw50z9pv10
Being LGBTQ is still illegal in nearly 40% of countries in the United Nations.  This headline isn’t surprising given this administration’s abysmal record on LGBTQ rights — but that doesn’t mean we should accept this as the status quo. https://t.co/Vg5WWrQvWO
Another targeted attack on CA by the Trump administration.  Clean air should be the most basic of human rights. This is a reckless political stunt that puts the health of MILLIONS of kids, families, and communities across America at risk. https://t.co/3qhKHK85DV
If we want a #CaliforniaForAll, we have to build housing for all. We need accountability. We need to support local governments that do what’s right, like Anaheim and Santa Rosa. https://t.co/2Eb2IUoBp4

The President didn’t get his way, so he’s trying to bypass Congress and use your taxpayer dollars for his pointless border wall. It’s reckless. It’s unprecedented. And California will not stand for it. https://t.co/G3lyjSw0hA
Instead of fighting the actual threats facing Americans, the President has chosen to undermine our Constitution and fan the flames of nativism &amp; xenophobia.  This is not a “national emergency”... it’s a national disgrace.  California will see you in court. https://t.co/TD1vftu9YF
Climate change affects the air we breathe, the water we drink, what we eat, and where we live. This is a REAL emergency. https://t.co/bgy4enNL1Z

I’ll tell you what’s an emergency:   Separated families Gun violence Climate change  Those are some real emergencies we're facing — not a pointless border wall.
The President didn’t get his way — so he’s manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up ‘national emergency’ to seize power and subvert the Constitution. California will not stand for it. https://t.co/o5uwirF3Bm

On average, 96 people are killed every day by gun violence in America. THIS is a real emergency. https://t.co/U1Rci35Ofa
President Trump is manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up “national emergency” in order to seize power. This “emergency” is a national disgrace -- and the blame lays solely at the feet of the President.  Our message to the White House is simple: CA will see you in court.
More than a million Californians woke up without clean drinking water this morning. Yesterday, I signed my first bill as Governor — to provide emergency funding to help solve this crisis. These children deserve better. https://t.co/qh9fXoupH4
Nearly 2,000 families have lost children to gun violence since Parkland and Republicans in Congress have done nothing to prevent it. If you cannot protect the kids of this country, you should not maintain any position of influence or power. #MSDStrong https://t.co/WbkMIhagfI

Fake news. We’re building high-speed rail, connecting the Central Valley and beyond.  This is CA’s money, allocated by Congress for this project. We’re not giving it back.  The train is leaving the station — better get on board!   (Also, desperately searching for some wall $$??) https://t.co/9hxEfEX8Vm
Climate change is a global threat, and California is not waiting around for Republicans in Washington to finally get their act together to tackle it. We’re taking matters into our own hands. https://t.co/dfnU3nzNJp
Your data has value and it belongs to you. California consumers have a right to know how their personal data is being used, but they should also be able to share in the wealth. https://t.co/001iBYzCRv
Grateful to have had Allyn Pierce with us yesterday. He’s a registered nurse in Paradise who — instead of saving himself — drove back through the fire to treat the injured and safely evacuate everyone. This is what we do in California. https://t.co/uPZVoTZPnS
This is so much more than a train project. It's a transformation project. Anchored by high-speed rail, we can align our economic, workforce, and transportation strategies to revitalize communities across our state.
For those who want to walk away: Abandoning high speed rail means we will have wasted billions of dollars with nothing but broken promises and lawsuits to show for it. I'm not interested in sending $3.5B in federal funding--exclusively allocated for HSR--back to the White House.
We're going to make high-speed rail a reality for CA. We have the capacity to complete the rail between Merced and Bakersfield. We will continue our regional projects north and south. Finish Phase 1 enviro work. Connect the Central Valley to other parts of the state.
Taking care of each other, showing courage when it matters most — this is what we do in California. I believe in our state. And I know this at the bottom of my heart: the best is yet to come. #CASOTS
The problems we face are as hard as they come and decades in the making. But I truly believe we have the tools to solve them. Most importantly, we have the ingenuity and generosity of our people. #CaliforniaforAll
The White House is laser-focused on destroying the ACA. This year’s @CoveredCA premiums increased almost twice as much as we expected. It’s exactly what we feared, and it’s exactly what they wanted. California must act where Washington has failed.
California should never be a place where only the well-off can lead a good life — but right now, 2/3 of our young people say they can’t afford to live here. If we want a #CaliforniaforAll, we have to build housing for all.
The fear-mongering from the White House about the so-called ‘emergency’ at our border is an attack on our friends and neighbors — and on California’s values. Our answer is this: No more division, no more xenophobia, and no more nativism.
We’re seeing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971 and our undocumented population is at its lowest level in more than a decade. Those are the facts.   The border ‘emergency’ is a manufactured crisis and California will not be a part of this political theater.
Last week, we heard the president offer a vision of an America fundamentally at odds with California values during the #SOTU. Just yesterday, he went down to El Paso and said it again. We must stand up for those maligned, marginalized, and scapegoated.
The tough calls we must make together on how we protect immigrants, tackle the housing crisis, guarantee affordable health care, and build a #CAforAll will shape the future of our state for decades to come. #CASOTS
The State of our State is strong — but along with that prosperity and progress, there are problems that have been deferred for too long and that threaten to put the California dream out of reach for too many. #CASOTS
The facts: → Immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens → Lowest number of border crossings since 1971 → Undoc population at its lowest level in more than a decade.  It’s time to stop using our National Guard as a political prop. https://t.co/Jl1HOomXBX

A reminder that the Trump administration has tried to enable insurance companies to deny coverage based on medical history.  That means those with:  - HIV - cancer - pregnancy - sleep apnea - acne - depression - anxiety  ...and more.
The Trump admin has manufactured a crisis on our border. They put children in cages and separated families. They demonized women seeking refuge. They vilianized children searching for a better life. A wall will not “save lives.” Real, comprehensive immigration reform will. #SOTU

Every day they’re faced with the choice of compromising their health to take care of their bills. That’s just not right. That’s why we’re proposing to expand health coverage to all low-income undocumented Californians up to age 26. Healthcare should be a basic human right.
They’re scared they will get sick and not be able to afford their doctor. They will get a cavity and not be able to get a filling. They will get hurt while they are out in the fields. Or that selling bracelets on the street will not be enough to help their parents stay afloat.
Rather than spending time with their friends... or studying for their next test, their days are consumed by the fears and anxieties of what tomorrow will look like.
Spent my morning with some of the most inspiring young adults I’ve met in a while. They work hard every day to support themselves, their families, their relatives abroad, and pay their way through school. And yes, they are undocumented.
The longest federal shutdown in our history has had devastating consequences on workers, their families, and the integrity of our government.  We cannot afford another one. https://t.co/c4SJw48FOE

This is a time for courage -- doing what is right even when it’s hard. It’s up to us what we do with it. America needs California -- the guiding light of our values and the progress we make possible. This is where America’s future is made. Let’s get to work.
There are powerful forces arrayed against us: from powerful drug companies, to a gun lobby prioritizing profit over children's lives, to polluters who threaten our air, and payday lenders who target our most vulnerable.  We have the power to stand up to them -- and we will.
What we do today is even more consequential because of what’s happening in our country. People’s lives, freedom, security: they all hang in the balance. The country is watching us. The world is waiting on us. The future depends on it. Have no doubt: We. Will. Seize. This. Moment.
The California dream runs deep in the history and character of our state -- but there is nothing inevitable about it. It’s up to us to renew the CA dream for a new generation. But it’s also up to us to defend it.

CA rises together. Even in the face of tragedies like the Camp Fire, Woolsey Fire and the many others CA has faced in the last few years--we lift one another up.  Huge thanks to @CASenatorJim, @HenrySternCA, @ilike_mike, @SenHannahBeth and @AsmMoniqueLimon for joining us tonight! https://t.co/rmmfVP01ei
Wow -- INCREDIBLE to see so many folks stepping up, stepping in and helping us raise nearly $5M for victims &amp; first responders at our CA Rises concert!!  Thank you @pitbull, @XAmbassadors, @BettyWho, @common, &amp; #ColdWeatherSons for helping us reach this incredible goal!  #CARises https://t.co/aZnhGOIabe
So fun to join the @warriors and @SacramentoKings last night with the family -- what a game!! https://t.co/zmwaVKcT19
100 years ago, women received the right to vote. Today, over 100 women are joining the most diverse Congress in our history -- a Congress that looks more like America.  Congrats, @SpeakerPelosi! Excited to see what this historic Congress will achieve. https://t.co/kTrQNRi0on
Today marks a new era in DC.  One that’s focused on EVERY person’s ability to succeed. One that will protect women’s rights. LGBT rights. Healthcare. Clean air. Clean water. And will NOT shutdown our govt over a pointless wall.  Looking forward to working w/ the @HouseDemocrats!
$558 billion worth of goods flow across our America's southern border. BILLIONS of dollars -- MILLIONS of jobs depend on our border.  The President of the United States playing games with our economy and threatening to shut down our border is irresponsible, irrational and absurd. https://t.co/Y3zHsx7Jxg
Progress:  This year, states across our country stepped up and passed dozens of common sense gun reforms.  The @NRA was outdone and outspent by people who are sick and tired of seeing gun violence plague our nation.  Your turn, Congress. https://t.co/O3ePlwlqmn
Merry Christmas from our family to yours!  Wishing everyone a season of peace, joy, compassion, and renewed dedication -- to justice, care, equality, and love. ❤️  Happy Holidays!
The last major government shutdown cost us BILLIONS. It was bad for our economy. Bad for our stability. Bad for working families. Bad for our country’s reputation.  This will be the THIRD shutdown in a year.  Quit playing games. End this shutdown. https://t.co/ErbmtUnA67
This shutdown is not something to be “proud” of. It’s an avoidable and manufactured crisis -- based off a wall that will be nothing more than a monument of stupidity.  It will disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives.  It’s an embarrassment.
Last government shutdown cost us $24B and 120,000 jobs.  This is not something to play politics with.  This is people’s ability to pay their mortgage. Buy their kids Christmas presents. Put food on their table. It’s 800,000 lives being thrown into chaos -- over a pointless wall.
A step in the right direction — but we have to do MORE.  We cannot allow the @NRA to purchase our politicians &amp; laws. We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to protect our children &amp; our communities.  We need comprehensive gun reform. NOW. https://t.co/1cYRuERKbu
This is Jakelin Ameí Rosmery Caal Maquin. She was 7-years-old. She died in Border Patrol custody.  We are supposed to be a land of dreams. One that cares for its children. One that protects those seeking refuge.  We need an immediate investigation into how and why this happened. https://t.co/Oy6qEi5Mgb
TODAY is the LAST day for open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act.   CA -- you have until January 15th!  Go to https://t.co/7Bh4CfRiEw now. It’s not too late to get covered.
This outrageous and misguided ruling endangers tens of millions of people’s healthcare. It puts pre-existing conditions protections at risk and the coverage of 7.3 million children and young adults in jeopardy.  Have no doubt -- CA will fight back. https://t.co/yurCUodAnL
Six years ago, 20 innocent children and 6 adults' lives were stolen.  Today, gun violence continues to plague our nation -- from our schools, to movie theaters, to churches, to streets -- killing nearly 100 Americans every day.  We cannot accept this as our reality. #SandyHook https://t.co/lfsA4ZiXEG
She was 7-years-old. She died on American soil. In custody.  What is happening at our border is nothing short of a humanitarian crisis. It cannot be ignored — and will not be solved by a wall.  There must be a thorough investigation into this. https://t.co/rJv6zUY5xT
I will forever cherish the time we had together. And while he won't be able to be there for my swearing in, I'm encouraged and proud to be taking on a job that will help continue his legacy and make this state he loved a more just, equitable place.
He had an amazing life -- filled with love, laughter, politics, and nature. From camping along California's rivers, to this last election night, he never swayed from the lesson he taught me from a young age: it's never the wrong time to do the right thing.
Jen and I are eternally grateful for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time. Yesterday, my sister &amp; I lost our father, my children lost their grandpa &amp; CA lost a legend. He was a voice to the voiceless. An advocate for the environment. An inspiration to me.
https://t.co/uY99jMWDGt
Disseminating truth. The ability to speak up and speak out. The right to fair and factual information. These are not only essential parts to our democracy — but our freedom. Thank you. https://t.co/ZSavvR3lXU
Our hearts break for this town. https://t.co/R5M2pj38kh
During my campaign we hosted over 40 town halls. We went straight to the people of CA — asked them questions and listened to the issues that they’re facing.   That doesn’t end now.  Great to be back in Fresno today! https://t.co/qsGflAK6Q7
Tonight, we remember that light can always overcome darkness. That we must always maintain hope, pursue peace, and never cease to love.  Wishing a very happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating!! https://t.co/hunSt2uWIh
President George H.W. Bush exemplified public service through decency, civility, and honor. His legacy will live on forever. https://t.co/v5iq4dy0HX
An amazing and productive day in Mexico City. It’s California’s responsibility to help lead the nation and build a relationship with Mexico based on compassion, justice, and prosperity. https://t.co/vR7Bve9siu
At the border today, I met a 3-year-old girl. She was innocent and kind, and was being housed in this shelter. She came here because someone sought a better life for her.  CA is a state of refuge. A place of new beginnings. Of compassion and inclusion.  We can’t forget that. https://t.co/MC6hFPCoWu
These children are barefoot. In diapers. Choking on tear gas.  Women and children who left their lives behind -- seeking peace and asylum -- were met with violence and fear.  That’s not my America. We’re a land of refuge. Of hope. Of freedom.  And we will not stand for this. https://t.co/1APpeHIq6v
The Trump admin tried to bury this report. But, the evidence of climate change is all around us -- and the consequences of inaction are deadly.  Our health will be severely impacted. We’ll continue to see record-breaking fires. Industries will be wiped out.  We must act. Now. https://t.co/GbeilF2aeP
A lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. But today, I'm especially thankful for our heroic firefighters and first responders who've been working around the clock to save lives. They embody what CA means: resilient, compassionate, &amp; always willing to lift another up. Thank you.
These communities have lost homes, schools, and loved ones — but they have not lost their spirit.  Californians stand together in times of need. And when the cameras are gone, and the news-cycle has moved on, we make sure we’re there for those that have been impacted by disaster. https://t.co/2Cu43zJjpi

CONGRATULATIONS to @katieporteroc! Katie has spent her entire career fighting for what's right -- standing up for those who need a champion and protecting consumers. I know she will do the same in DC! https://t.co/rqNlS4ivyO
What a reminder of the resilience and compassion that embodies California.   Despite the incredible damage that the #WoolseyFire has caused, first responders, firefighters, and folks who have lost nearly everything greeted me with nothing but hope, strength, and optimism. https://t.co/NopaTPfTA1
Thanks for welcoming me -- beyond grateful for the work you all are doing. https://t.co/PAzi8j99m1

Californians are strong. We show up for each other. If you're not in harm's way, please consider donating anything you can to those who have been affected by CA's fires: https://t.co/zxOB7MpDYR

The smoke from these wildfires can be harmful to your health — even if you are not in a directly affected area. Make sure you are protecting yourself. https://t.co/tWgNweeJSe
CA is home to nearly 2 million veterans. Today, we thank you for your service and sacrifice — and recommit to showing you that gratitude through our actions. It’s our turn to serve you, not just on Veterans Day, but every day we’re lucky enough to call you fellow Californians.
Today, I stood in awe of the strength and resilience of the people of Paradise, CA. Folks who lost everything, bending down on a knee to help another up.  Forever grateful for our firefighters and first responders on the frontlines tonight, battling these fires to keep CA safe. https://t.co/TOY1LZXo8U
Some ways you can help those who have been displaced by the #CaliforniaFires:  https://t.co/qXuiMoRwvY
Lives have been lost. Entire towns have been burned to the ground. Cars abandoned on the side of the road. People are being forced to flee their homes. This is not a time for partisanship. This is a time for coordinating relief and response and lifting those in need up. https://t.co/sAZ3QULV8G
CA mourns tonight -- for the lives lost and communities consumed by these devastating fires.  If you live in or near affected areas, please stay alert. Prepare to evacuate. Listen to local authorities. https://t.co/FgTXvW8MgB

Thinking of our firefighters today. Thank you for your courage and willingness to put your lives on the line to protect our CA communities.  To all those in affected areas — please listen to local authorities’ warnings and follow all evacuation orders.
Grateful for the opportunity to join folks at @stanthonysf today -- thank you for all you do to serve the city of SF! https://t.co/vzwjlXOrHq
Grateful for the bravery of Ventura County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, who put his life on the line to protect others. He was a true hero that will be deeply missed.
The gun violence that continues to plague our nation is beyond heartbreaking -- it's a societal failure. Simply saying, "enough is enough," is NOT enough. We must address the root causes of these devastating acts at every level of government.
Last night's horrific shooting in Thousand Oaks is nothing short of a tragedy. Our hearts are with all those whose loved ones were stolen from them too soon, by yet another senseless act of gun violence.
Now is the time for going far and going together. For facts. For trust. For truth. Now is the time for leaders to lead.   This is California’s moment. Incredibly honored and privileged to serve as this great state’s next Governor. https://t.co/DGFcfZOS7d

"We will consider that a firearm." - The President of the United States.   Talking about ROCKS -- and ordering border control to fire upon unarmed people legally seeking asylum.  This is completely insane.

Courage for a change isn’t just about our campaign -- it’s about all of California. It’s about the blue wave that’s coming. It’s about CA’s vision and America’s values being one and the same.

Hello from California, @realDonaldTrump. 👋  We are not “rioting.”  We do, however, think it is a horrific tragedy that migrant children remain separated from their families because of your horrendous immigration policies. https://t.co/CpeiSTc7rb
Happy birthday, @KamalaHarris!! Thank you for your courage and fearlessness. Here's to another year of pushing California and our nation forward!
Clean air to breathe. Clean water to drink. These should be the most basic of human rights.  Climate change isn't just about the environment, it's about the human condition. We have to take it seriously. https://t.co/EZx4w0v5Aj
P.S.- next time you bring up the gas tax, @realDonaldTrump, you should really address the 25 cent one you endorsed --&gt; https://t.co/8OyYvilLrz
When the guy who increased our nation’s deficit by a trillion dollars -- to line the pockets of billionaires -- tries to give you debt advice...  HARD PASS. https://t.co/6v8u6RStlT
Mitch McConnell has summed up the election for us. A vote for the @GOP means a vote...  to take away healthcare,  to cut Medicare,  to gut Medicaid,  to slash Social Security  ...all to pay for billionaire tax cuts and a deficit they have made worse.  https://t.co/YQlqtn0CfO
Definitely my better half! :) https://t.co/H6RKsGRPx3
The @GOP believe that we should cut spending on healthcare, the poor, and the elderly so they can pay for tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations.  Remember that on November 6th.  https://t.co/DKU3MXgntE
This makes my blood boil -- there is NOTHING “incredible” about ripping children away from their families and putting them in cages.  Your policy was not only an epic failure, but an abomination. A stain on our nation’s history.  We will not let you forget that, @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9zEuXeQBe3
@KaramoBrown Thanks for your support!!
Almost like we saw this coming.... but remember, Mitch -- the tax cuts are supposed to pay for themselves! https://t.co/obY5R70Z1Z
22 days. 22 days to text, to call, to canvass, to VOTE. We can’t afford to sit this one out.  We have the power to shape our country’s future — to push a positive, progressive agenda forward. https://t.co/K9JSBvyqwq
Trump claimed last night that climate change is not man-made, is too expensive to fix, and accused scientists of having a "political agenda."  This isn't ignorance -- this is the purposeful dismissal of factual evidence and science. And it's dangerous.  https://t.co/ZARf7JjXii
Great to join my friend, @LibbySchaaf today! Oakland has such an amazing leader in her — one who will always stand up for Oakland’s values and will stand against Trump’s attacks on our diverse communities.  A huge thanks to all the volunteers who came to canvass!! https://t.co/bMrSumgR36

Hey @realDonaldTrump, California has a message for you:  We're not backing down. We will fight for healthcare as a human right, defend our schools against Betsy DeVos and her backwards agenda, and protect our coastlines against destructive oil drilling.  See you in November. https://t.co/uF0Rx77Uxi

This is a lie.  The Graham-Cassidy bill YOU supported allowed for eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions, insurers to NOT cover things like pregnancy, and contained devastating cuts to Medicaid.  It would have led to millions being priced out or losing coverage. https://t.co/zHOFw9dcX3

Hi (again), @realDonaldTrump. Heard you called me out at your rally tonight (again).  Might I suggest you focus your limited attention span on, say... your Supreme Court nominee who may have committed perjury... or the hundreds of kids STILL separated from their families. Thx.
Hundreds of migrant children are being shipped to shelters each week like pieces of cargo.  They are given no notice and are told in the dead of the night so they are less likely to run.  1,600 children have been moved so far.  WE. CANNOT. NORMALIZE. THIS. https://t.co/UjMSijysC1
For too long our society has told us to value what's considered “masculine” — dominance, aggression, power — over traits considered “feminine”— empathy, care and compassion.  That value system has real consequences. This week is proof. So grateful for your work, @JenSiebelNewsom! https://t.co/Xpf8wmbW3x
Our team is out today helping elect @VoteCottie to the CA Assembly!  Amazing to see so many folks stepping up to turn Orange County blue &amp; elect amazing leaders.

This week has been a heavy one, but we cannot lose hope.  The @GOP have demonstrated time and time again that they will always put partisanship &amp; power over morality &amp; decency.  Election Day is 39 days away. Register. Vote. Bring a friend.  We can — we MUST — be better than this.

497 migrant children are STILL separated from their parents and remain in government custody.  The Trump administration was ordered to reunite these families 36 days ago.  This is a humanitarian crisis.  @realDonaldTrump is hoping we forget. We will not.
So... to be clear... you think we can afford a $1.4 TRILLION tax cut for millionaires and corporations, but we cannot afford to give a public servant a 2% pay raise. https://t.co/WYi3he83OM
The President of the United States calling the press the “enemy of the people” is reckless and endangers our democracy — we absolutely cannot normalize this. We have to continue calling it out. https://t.co/iGsKmTdfvX
2,975 people died. 2,975 lives lost forever. There is absolutely nothing “fantastic” about that.  It’s a tragedy. https://t.co/71FBlJGAm8
What the @GOP is too scared to admit:  If we don’t offer coverage to everyone - regardless of income or immigration status - we will still carry the expense.  Universal access isn’t just the right thing to do - it’s the economically smart thing to do. https://t.co/sPIQ7kCtXG
Congrats, @AndrewGillum on your historic victory! From the $15 minimum wage, to Medicare for all, and common sense gun reforms — you’ve always had the courage to step up and demand more. Keep up the fight — here’s to November!
California is America’s coming attractions — it’s time to lead the way to a carbon-free future. Congrats to my friends in CA State Assembly today for supporting #SB100.

On average, every day:  - 47 children and teens are shot. - 7 children and teens die from gun violence.  In one year:  - 17,207 children and teens are shot. - 2,737 kids die from gun violence.  We cannot stand idly by.  We cannot elect more politicians bought by the @NRA.  Vote.

Senator John McCain is a patriot who has dedicated his life to serving his country and constantly strived to put morality and principle over party.   My thoughts are with him and his family during this difficult time. https://t.co/ELTFKdSXQO
An estimated 528 children are STILL separated from their families because of the Trump administration’s cruel and feckless immigration policies.  We cannot forget about these children.
Watch this. Trump openly admits that the definition of “real news” is an outlet that reports favorably of him. Everyone else he is declaring the “enemy.”  THIS IS NOT NORMAL.  This is the President of the United States endangering our democracy. https://t.co/vwIsNpVGA9
Teachers across the country cannot afford to buy basic school supplies for their classrooms.  But we’re discussing buying them guns.   Remember that in November. https://t.co/DxBkbjmBEQ

Clean air.  Clean water.  Food to feed your family.  Healthcare that doesn’t bankrupt you.  An education that prepares you for the future.  An affordable, safe place to call home.  These should not be outlandish ideas.  These should be basic human rights.
The Trump administration is choosing to protect predatory lenders over those who have served and been willing to risk their lives for our country.  Just think about that. https://t.co/m5NVuwwfzY

Over 60 countries have BANNED asbestos.   Thousands die from it every year.   It puts workers at risk.  It puts communities where the products are made at risk.  It puts our environment at risk.  It should not be legal, @realDonaldTrump.  https://t.co/Eh54IOQFeh
44 years ago today — Richard Nixon’s resignation. https://t.co/4mUleIdRvk
First, they put families seeking asylum in cages.  Now, the Trump admin wants to make it harder for LEGAL immigrants to become citizens.  This proposal could affect more than 20,000,000 immigrants and punishes those seeking healthcare and food assistance. https://t.co/Emvkxqli1k
What a win.   Together, American workers have helped build the backbone of our economy — a strong middle class. From higher wages, to the 40-hour work week, to health and safety laws, so many have benefitted from the right to organize.  This victory is just the beginning. https://t.co/Ygh1ti9fPb
Stripping away patient protections. Making care more expensive for those with pre-existing conditions.  Eliminating &amp; reducing access to healthcare — all for a political “win.”  These are the values of the @GOP.  This is what’s on the ballot in Nov.  Vote. https://t.co/7cYVtTV927

Brett Kavanaugh will do nothing but side with Trump’s dangerous, bigoted agenda.  He believes assault weapons bans are unconstitutional, would dismantle the ACA, rip away a woman’s right to choose, and threaten LGBT and voting rights.  He would be a disaster for our country.

The Trump Administration has been defined by chaos and cruelty - family separation is both.

@LauraDern @JenSiebelNewsom Great to see you - thank you for coming out today!
Trump has cruelly torn apart thousands of families. Now, he’s indefinitely detaining families.  Time to stand up &amp; say no more. We‘ve seen the worst of America embodied by Donald Trump - now it’s time for the world to see the very best of America. Join us: https://t.co/d38nCQmguc
America deserves to go to work, school, a concert, a place of worship, ANYWHERE, without fearing for our lives.  These reporters were on the frontlines of democracy. They did not deserve to be on the frontlines of gun violence. Our hearts go out to their loved ones &amp; colleagues.
Every major civil rights movement, from LGBT rights, to labor, to racial equality, has succeeded because of people showing up &amp; speaking up.  If Trump wants to try and desecrate equality, the right to choose, the right to privacy--I'm going to make my voice heard. You should too.

Today’s #Janus ruling is one against workers’ rights. The right to organize has helped to build our strong middle class, the backbone of our economy.

Trump’s Executive Order does not address:  - How these 2,000+ children will be reunited with their parents.  - His plan to create new detention facilities for FAMILIES.  Separating kids is sick — but so is imprisoning families indefinitely.
Rachel's reaction was similar to mine. This is nearly unbearable to even process.  Toddlers are being detained. Kids that have been forcibly torn away from their parents are being put in "Tender Age" shelters, described as "play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis." https://t.co/xFZufFOzO8
In recognizing Juneteenth, we must also recognize the tremendous work remaining to end institutionalized racism in America.    From the border to the ballot box, sinister forces are attempting to roll back progress. Thank you to everyone on the front lines of these fights.

@JustinCentric 🤔🤔 thanks for your support!
Yes, he is a hero. But all I can think about is how much we’re asking of our teachers because of YOUR failure to act.  Our teachers are being forced to risk their lives because the spineless @GOP are too busy pandering to the NRA. #GunSenseNow https://t.co/WTRexQB7cL
In the words of @RuPaul... you better vote! 😉 California's primary is June 5th! Make sure your voice is heard.  Oh and...Miss Vaaanjie.... https://t.co/REPSd3AwgB

“It’s like the front lines of a war,” said Emily Rubinstein, a sophomore at a New York high school. “Being seated in front of the classroom could be what makes you live and what makes you die.”  This is the reality we have created for our children.  https://t.co/W5aECnDDfI
My opponent, @TheRealJohnHCox has been endorsed by his hero, Donald Trump.  More important than ever that CA stands up for our values and stands against Trump, his protégé, and their attempts to drag our state backwards.

No surprise you’re endorsing a candidate in your own image: one who attacks immigrants while opposing common sense gun laws and equal rights.  Time &amp; time again, the people of California have rejected your brand of hate. The people of California will reject @TheRealJohnHCox too. https://t.co/jc8D6ZeoJn

“Was there a part of you that was like, this isn't real, this could not happen at my school?”  Santa Fe Student: “No. It’s been happening everywhere. I’ve always felt like it would eventually happen here, too.”  This has become the new normal in America. https://t.co/tpZEdoychP
In 2018, there have been 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed. That's more than 1 shooting a week.  My heart aches for Santa Fe, but to say today is simply a tragedy isn't enough. If we cannot protect our children we've failed. We need commonsense gun reform. NOW.
One of our greatest tools for change is our vote. Don't take that for granted. CA's deadline to register to vote is May 21st!   Make sure your voice is heard this June 5th.  https://t.co/ArCk7EBU2Q
A reminder that Trump also referred to: - Mexicans as “drug dealers" and "rapists” - Haitians as having AIDS - Central American and African countries as “sh*t-holes” - Nigerians as living in huts  So no, I'm not trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Together, I know we can tell our elected officials and the @NRA that our laws are NOT for sale.   We do this for our teachers. We do this for our children. We do this for the generations to come. The time is now, the movement is here, now let’s create the change.
We must continue to fight back against the dangerous rhetoric of the @NRA -- but we cannot do it alone. It will take each one of us, talking with our neighbors, our colleagues. Calling our legislators. Writing letters to our leaders. Protesting peacefully.
This cannot end today. With a President and a Congress more focused on lining their pockets with @NRA cash than saving lives, it is more important now than ever that we stand together and demand more. It’s time we raise our voices and say we have had ENOUGH.
It is the millions — literally, millions — of conversations that students and everyone marching today are holding - and winning - on gun violence that are changing our nation.
We cannot stop raising our voices until every child, mother, father, brother, sister, community member, is safe at school, a concert, a mall, or a park. No one deserves to live their life in fear of being shot. But that’s the sad reality of today.

Upwards of a million people in CA live in homes with contaminated drinking water. It’s an embarrassment that so many go home at night and can’t drink from the faucet or bathe their kids safely . We need to work together to solve this moral crisis. #WorldWaterDay
Oh you mean THIS study? The one that you deliberately misrepresent?  The one that concludes we absolutely need the very research that @NRA and the spokespeople / congressional members they own continue to block? --&gt; https://t.co/QjKggmUaw2 https://t.co/tyjEgyW52b
More than a little ironic that the NRA says we must be supplied with the facts, but has spent the last 20+ years blocking the CDC from researching gun violence. https://t.co/YWbxGwEADt
Time to demand more of our elected leaders who have cowered in fear of the @NRA for far too long. Enough. https://t.co/7QAH7TzIVH
Toni Atkins is making history as the first woman and LGBTQ Pro Tem, but what makes her truly extraordinary is her authenticity, intellect and compassion. She will be one of CA’s great Senate leaders. Proud to stand by her side on this historic day. https://t.co/sM48O5qjSS
For the first time in nearly two decades, the majority of Americans are saying they have had enough of the @NRA.   Keep raising your voices. Keep demanding change. It's working.  https://t.co/iQT83uKULr
“There may be setbacks; you may sometimes feel like progress is too slow in coming. But we have no doubt you are going to make an enormous difference in the days and years to come, and we will be there for you.”  Couldn't agree more. https://t.co/FBfhnjasuZ
Ben Carson openly admitted he is slow walking protections for the LGBT community. This man's blatant disregard for equal rights and uninformed, anti-transgender policies should not be tolerated. Don't let this be the norm. https://t.co/horrFmRoK3
The War on Drugs was a failure. We need real resources to solve the opioid crisis. Trump's proposals to cut hundreds of billions from Medicaid programs threaten the progress states have made to confront this epidemic. https://t.co/4MdFKrW6k0

"Very poor job running" the state:  - 6th largest economy in the world.   - Continually outpaces the U.S. in job growth.  - Turned a 2010 deficit into a record surplus.   - Leads the national economy from personal income to high-wage jobs and more. https://t.co/hF1wufJ9L0
California is not "begging" you for this wall. Your wall is a waste of money and is literally impossible to complete. It will look more like a piece of swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier.   It's nothing more than a 6th century solution to a 21st century problem. https://t.co/wdLKTsiqWn
That moment when the only people who will back you up are an anti-immigrant, fear-mongering, far-right hate group. https://t.co/2EKX5fNvzw
So @realDonaldTrump has finally worked up the nerve to come to CA and visit his precious wall -- a 1900 mile monument to idiocy that is literally IMPOSSIBLE to complete.  We cannot let this small, scared bully hurt our economy and turn ICE into his own personal army of hate. https://t.co/k4p5LKvTKS
SHOCKER: Our spineless coward of a President actually is scared of the @NRA after all. https://t.co/eS27Lny3nq
Watching the President attack the press and use this kind of rhetoric is truly disturbing. This man will stop at nothing to boost his own ego. His constant racism, misogyny, and shaming of the press is outright dangerous, repulsive, and a stain on our democracy and our country. https://t.co/UWNXIsGAO0

In honor of #InternationalWomensDay wanted you all to get to know the most important woman in my life — @JenSiebelNewsom! Not only is she my wife, but she’s also a filmmaker and the founder and CEO of @TheRepProject (and all around boss lady)! https://t.co/OntpkSzwsI
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! From equal pay, to the right to choose, to universal paid family leave, to equal representation at all levels of leadership, more must be done to support and empower women and achieve true equality. Let’s keep up the fight.
Honestly couldn't be more proud that Jeff Sessions called me an embarrassment... https://t.co/LVWhOnNjsG
Sessions and Trump are suing California over our immigration policies. Wasn't too long ago that members of THEIR OWN PARTY thought otherwise. Here's Rudy Giuliani defending Sanctuary policy when he was Mayor of New York: https://t.co/9RlX4JR61P
Sessions and Trump should really do their homework before they decide to sue CA.  Sanctuary counties have:   - Fewer crimes committed - Higher median household incomes - Lower poverty rates - Lower unemployment rates  These policies keep us safe, and allow communities to thrive.
Live now! Make sure to tune in --&gt; https://t.co/XClRW9LRmi https://t.co/lqWzWQMzWG
I'm going live at 1:30pm to respond to Jeff Sessions calling me an "embarrassment," and to talk with Californians who have been threatened by @realDonaldTrump's immigration policies.  Watch here --&gt; https://t.co/9sc8mBTwGG
Jeff Sessions just called me an embarrassment.  A man whose legacy is targeting immigrants, re-waging the failed War on Drugs, sucking-up to private prison profiteers, and apologizing for white supremacists... I take that as a HUGE compliment.
Sanctuary policies (like SB-54) keep our communities safe and are consistent with the Constitution.  Hope you’re paying attention @jeffsessions and @realDonaldTrump because CA has a message for you:   We will not be bullied into accepting your “fear of everything” agenda. https://t.co/OtYTYrhu0X

The notion that we need to arm our teachers over passing smart gun laws is absurd.  In 1993, CA strengthened its gun laws. From 1993-2013 CA’s gun murder rate declined by 65%.  Smart gun laws work. Stop forcing teachers to become body guards because you won’t do your job. https://t.co/2UZQuSUqEj
Wrong. The debate after #Parkland shows that the next generation has far more courage than you and the other @GOP lackeys who refuse to pass reforms that will SAVE LIVES because the @NRA cuts checks to your campaign. https://t.co/l0rsKjtrDH

It’s time to choose courage.   Courage for a change.
This is more than a political campaign.  It's about Democrats acting like Democrats—in a battle for America's soul against a President without one.
They said: “pick your battles.”  We passed the state's highest minimum wage and took guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals.
They said: “pick your battles.”  We created the nation’s first citywide universal health care plan.
They said: “pick your battles.”   We said “love is love” and issued 4,036 same-sex marriage licenses in a winter of love.
My whole life, we’ve faced down skeptics. Defeatist Democrats who suggest we need to “pick our battles.”
No child should ever be afraid of going to school because cowardly politicians are afraid of a paper tiger called the @NRA.
Enough with these can't do politicians.   We can—and we must—demand that no child in this state be raised in poverty.
Enough with these can't do politicians.   We CAN build enough affordable housing to put a roof over everyone’s head.
Enough with these can't do politicians.   We CAN build a modern economy that works for everyone—one that rewards innovation, closes the wage and wealth gap for women, and respects organized labor.
Enough with these "can't do" politicians.   We CAN race faster to a future free of fossil fuels and fracking.
We demand an end to the systemic racism of mass incarceration. And while we're at it, let’s slam the door shut on cash bail and private prisons.
And we demand health care for every person — regardless of immigration status.
We demand the right for women to choose — and we will always protect Planned Parenthood.
We demand a life of dignity and security for seniors.
We demand a public education system that is the best in the world — and rejects the worst impulses of Betsy DeVos.
My opponents in this race have spent a lot of time telling us what CAN’T be done.  We need a Governor who says what CAN be done.  One who has the courage to demand more.
At our best, we don’t tolerate our diversity—we celebrate it.    We defend our DREAMers.   We demand equality.   And we disrupt the corrupt—but only when we have the courage of our convictions. When we dream bigger and reach higher.  The time for timidity is OVER.
Emma is leading the change we need to see in this country. Let’s strip the @NRA’s power to purchase our laws. https://t.co/qwuiaiDWrF

There have been at least 8 school shootings in the last year. We need real leaders committed to real change — before another child’s life is stolen by gun violence. https://t.co/GkBz7ZoOtk

- Placed a ban on transgender people in the military -Appointed a VP who supported conversion therapy - Appointed multiple people to courts with anti-LGBT records - Refused to acknowledge Pride month  If Trump has made anything clear it’s that he does not care for equality. https://t.co/TxeDIqCJSy
It’s simple: we need fair elections with fairly drawn districts. This is a huge step in the right direction. Politicians have been able to pick and choose their voters for far too long. https://t.co/MLaEjVpzwR
CA will now have a process in place to ensure that dangerous, convicted criminals are forced to get rid of their guns. We know that if we don't direct our efforts and funds to this cause, it's not a matter of if but when we will see another tragedy. https://t.co/VrUclSlonX
It’s been 45 yrs, yet Trump continues to attack a woman’s right to choose. He has: -Reversed the ACA mandate to cover birth control -Tried to defund Planned Parenthood -Appointed anti-choice judges ...And that’s just the beginning.  It’s appalling &amp; wrong. https://t.co/tN9YwhiaD5

Ready to march!! - @JenSiebelNewsom https://t.co/bdzsTSWlQb
We believe that every child deserves a fair shot. We believe in the common humanity of all of us. That's why I'm marching today, and why Gavin and I fight every day to make sure our country is moving in the right direction: forward.  Hope to see you out there! - @JenSiebelNewsom
We believe that women are people who deserve equality and respect. We believe that racism is unacceptable, and must be fought with every ounce of our beings. We believe that immigrants, from every corner of this earth, are the life-blood of this country.
So let me tell you what Gavin and I stand FOR, and why I will be marching in solidarity with so many of you today. We stand for equality and justice for all. We see deep inequalities in this country and believe it is our responsibility to do what we can to fix them.
He is deeply sexist and misogynistic, consistently showing us through his words and actions that he does not respect women, that he values us only for our youth or beauty -- NOT for our intelligence, our contributions to society, our capacity to lead.
Gavin and I have 2 daughters and 2 sons. We have so many dreams for their futures. Growing up under Trump was never one of them. He privileges the few over the many. He's a flat-out racist and xenophobic, and consistently pursues policies that demonize some and divide us all.
.@JenSiebelNewsom here! I'll be taking over Gavin’s account during the Women’s March in SF. I believe there has never been a more important time to band together, and proclaim loudly who we are and what what we stand for.
This fake ultimatum worked out SUPER well for you. https://t.co/iXiWY2YFFH
At this moment, I ask @realDonaldTrump to remember his own words: https://t.co/JgN5XpsrJ5
The Senate REPUBLICANS do not have the votes to fund a government led by a REPUBLICAN majority in Congress and a REPUBLICAN President. Time to do some soul searching, @GOP (if you remember what that is).
In any given year, 1 in 4 families in CA deal with a mental health condition. We all know someone. Whether we’re living with brain illness, or it’s a spouse, child, sibling, or friend.   We must treat brain health as seriously as physical health. https://t.co/9XciN6Kd1X

1.9 million children -- 1 in 5 kids -- that live in CA  are living in poverty. We need to make ending childhood poverty a priority. It’s time to demand more.   I teamed up with @autumnrburke to discuss how we can help break the cycle of poverty: https://t.co/mc1KvIFwHW
Things the @GOP see as a “high priority” to fund: - Millionaires - Billionaires - Mega-donors - Themselves  Things they see as a waste of money: - Children - Healthcare - Victims of wildfires - Victims of hurricanes - Young immigrants   https://t.co/KZK7664e9Z
Legalizing marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform. It's about ending the failed war on drugs and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities.   Proud of the work California is doing. https://t.co/vuhvPfAIm3
From someone who has seen firsthand what these weapons can do. https://t.co/dqFwN8VpxT
In one bill the @GOP have perfectly summed up their priorities:  Millionaires over children.  Corporations over middle class.  Wealthy over sick. Money over morality. Party over country.   G.reed O.ver P.eople

It's been 5 years since 20 first graders were shot dead at Sandy Hook.   Since then: 14 killed in San Bernardino 49 killed in Orlando 58 killed in Vegas 26 killed in a Texas church Enough.  We have a message for the @NRA: If you hurt people, we ARE coming for your guns. https://t.co/jcOCfs0AJO
These kids should be tweens now, worried about middle school dances and rolling their eyes at their parents for not being "cool enough."   Instead, these 20 first graders will forever be 6- and 7-year-olds, while the @GOP continue to cater to the @NRA. https://t.co/rtZwfOZa6x
Doug Jones is a fighter and fierce advocate for equality who will make Alabama and America proud. As the @GOP continue their assault on so much of what makes America already great, Alabama has sent a clear message: we can still choose hope over hate, and decency over decay.

Good morning,  In case you were asleep like a normal person would be, and NOT looking at the news in the middle of the night, the Senate passed a massive tax bill.   The @GOP plan will hurt: -Teachers -Students -Women -Homeowners -Our healthcare system -The environment (and more)
Tomorrow, America will wake up to see @GOP passed a huge tax overhaul in the dead of the night. There were no public hearings. Senators were given only hours to read a 479 page bill w illegible, handwritten amendments. This bill will affect millions of lives. This is a disgrace.

If you’re serious about “federal support” - pass laws to reduce gun violence. Your usual lame excuse - “too soon after tragedy to discuss gun laws” - guarantees we will literally never have a chance to move forward and save lives. https://t.co/a8QRZ9aeic
Been 9 days since 26 people were gunned down in a church, 44 since 58 were killed at a concert, and now at least 4 are dead and shots have been fired at a CA elementary school. This epidemic has stolen too many lives. We need immediate action to help put an end to this nightmare.

When it comes to schools, our standard must be local control and free and quality public education for all students.
The true objective of public ed isn’t about picking winners and losers. It’s about equity. It's about ensuring that every child can succeed.
When I was Mayor, I treated educators as working partners not punching bags. Our focus was protecting public education &amp; putting kids first.
Time to engage our teachers and every stakeholder who’s committed to keeping the promise of public ed in a long-term plan for excellence.
CA’s teachers aren’t the problem – they are an essential part of the solution.  We don’t need to attack teachers – we need to attract them.
I'm tired of the demagogues demonizing the everyday heroes of the classroom who have devoted their dreams to helping kids achieve theirs.
I'm tired of the argument that to save public education we must first dismantle it.
Educational excellence isn’t conceived in Sacramento – it comes from the toil of hundreds of thousands of teachers teaching in classrooms.

Don’t be fooled: we CAN create a system that provides comprehensive health benefits: mental, dental, eye &amp; substance treatment for everyone
I’ve been dealing with cynics and naysayers my entire career. The only limits on what California can achieve are our will and imagination.
I’m tired of politicians saying they support single payer but that it’s too soon, too expensive or someone else’s problem.
It’s time for a new approach. Single payer offers a simpler, more effective, more cost-efficient approach to healthcare delivery in CA.
No one should be left at the mercy of corps like Anthem, which spend a fortune to attract healthy people and avoid the sick and the needy.
Providers shouldn’t be forced to spend more time doing paperwork and data entry than they do seeing patients.
Patients shouldn’t have to navigate an indecipherable labyrinth of pricing structures, co-pays and deductibles every time they see a doctor.
When it comes to matters of life and death, good enough just isn’t good enough. Californians are sick and tired of being sick and tired.
It is a disaster that will create an immediate health crisis for millions – that’s not me saying that, that’s the Assoc. of Health Plans.
Graham-Cassidy is a white flag of surrender on a natl health care solution. A smash-and-grab raid on the working poor &amp; the end of Medicaid.
When I’m Governor, I will not wait for federal action – I will lead by example.
We’ve lead on climate change, criminal justice reform, labor standards, minimum wage &amp; immigrant rights. We'll do it again on healthcare.
But, I’m a Californian. And I don’t like waiting. I don’t like following. I like leading – and inviting other states to follow.
Healthcare is a natl crisis. Proud to be the first candidate for Gov to announce my strong support for Sen. Sanders’ Medicare for All bill.
No country in the world pays more per capita for healthcare and receives less than the United States.
We can never achieve that ideal when our system’s health decisions are based not on need, but on ability to pay.
The basic goal of any health system should be to provide care to those who need it, when they need it.
It’s about our economy. It’s about social equity. It’s about human justice. And frankly it’s about time.
Universal healthcare is the fundamental metric by which a civilized society must measure itself.
@GOP Ensuring a guarantee of high-quality health care for every person has been a defining issue for my entire public life.
Let's talk about the future of our shared fight to guarantee healthcare for all in CA–which is even more urgent given the recent @GOP threat

Ending this program is a cruel and pointless move by a President who has no soul. @GOP, prove you are better than this. Pass the Dream Act.
In CA, we know that our diversity makes us stronger. DACA has allowed 223,000 young people to come forward &amp; contribute to our communities.
Nothing undermines our fundamental American values more than the persecution of our most vulnerable: young people who know no other home.

All workers have benefited from the gains achieved by unions, ranging from the min wage, to the 40-hour work week, to health &amp; safety laws.
By exercising their rights to organize &amp; collectively bargain, American workers have built the backbone of our econ: a strong middle class.
This is a cruel move by a POTUS driven by intolerance and ignorance, who lacks a basic understanding of immigration policy and the economy. https://t.co/xGkRjE0icb

In CA alone, DACA has allowed nearly 223,000 young people to come forward, and better contribute to their families and communities.

@nick_ekwall @GOP Since ACA took effect, # of Americans w/out coverage decreased from 57 mil to 26 mil.  AHCA does the opposite.  Facts over feelings here.

@Millertyme10 oh I pledged to sharia law? was I asleep when that happened... because I don't remember it.
@Brandontheblade I'm glad we can so vigorously agree on the need to keep a clear, unwavering separation of church and state.
@nick_ekwall As I said to others, I'm opposed to extreme interpretations of religious texts, regardless of religion.
@yldja I did?  Please show me where I said or even implied "they don't have the right to protest."  (Not being sarcastic.)
@marblee @veekman3 Also sad that some folks have legitimately been convinced by talk radio that sharia law is somehow a creeping threat in this country.
@marblee @veekman3 Believe extreme interpretation and application of religious texts (regardless of religion) is dangerous....
@nick_ekwall I would humbly posit that in the United States, there are FAR greater threats to women and the LGBT community than sharia.
@Brandontheblade Extreme interpretation of religious texts is extremely destructive.
@veekman3 hoh boy, keep trying.
@yldja Again, not arguing their right, however sad it may be that this is an actual fear that has been sown in he culture
@yldja Did I miss the part where I said they don't have the right to protest invented talk radio threats?
@poncho1965 @BrannockDevice I don't assail anyone's right to peacefully demonstrate: I mourn that cynical fear-mongering has lead folks to see this as a real threat.

Trump is on a quest to remake America in his own image: a nation that screws over allies &amp; habitually breaks its word.   It's not who we are
Climate change is an existential threat. Every nation, region and community has interest and agency in rising to this challenge.
CA will step into the Trump vacuum and step onto the intl stage in partnership w/other nations &amp; regions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
In contrast, CA has proven that sustainable values &amp; job creation go hand-in-hand and economies thrive when we seek to capture the future...
Trump’s abandonment of the Paris Climate Deal demonstrates once again that he is void of basic business acumen, foresight, or initiative.
CA stands united and recognizes our unique responsibility to increase our role as POTUS abdicates our nation's leadership. #ParisAgreement https://t.co/cxCPaXxf8F

to build our infrastructure, construct new health care facilities, provide student loans, &amp; build 3.5 million new housing units by 2025.
But that’s not enough. We need an econ that breaks Wall Street’s chokehold on state finance. It’s time to develop our own state bank...
Regardless of your ability to pay or  immigration status.  A plan where being a woman is not considered a pre-existing condition.  #CADEM17
Universal access is an econ imperative. Working w/the best health providers in the world we'll achieve a system where everyone is covered...
I was proud to be the only statewide official in CA to support all 5 criminal justice reform measures. #CADEM2017 https://t.co/YzP1osr7Eu

Democrats don't succeed by playing it safe. The world is counting on us to reject Trump's deception and bring our country back 2 the future.
On November 8th, California gained a new mission: One state.  One statement.  Resistance... with results. #CADEM2017
These CA Republicans out party over patriotism and have sold their soul to a President without one.  #CADEM2017

We cannot allow this. Stand up for every Californian. Call your Rep today and let them know why you don't support #Trumpcare.
.@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump and all those standing behind this bill should be sickened by their own actions.
.@SpeakerRyan would rather force his own ideology on everyone than allow the constituents of CA be able to afford health insurance.
#Trumpcare is an ideological and partisan attack on CA and our country, the victims of which are the elderly, poor, and sick.
On top of that #Trumpcare is attacking reproductive healthcare by defunding Planned Parenthood, which 2.5 million women &amp; men visit annually
Because of that mandate, #Trumpcare would not allow for Californians to receive the tax credits meant to offset health insurance costs.
CA believes in a woman's right to make her own choices. Our current policy mandates that elective abortions be offered in every health plan.
Recap: the antiabortion provision in #Trumpcare makes it impossible for most Californians to take advantage of the tax credits being offered

.@NCGOP Many people of color have been keenly aware of this "selective democracy" for a long time.  now we must ensure ALL know it and are ready.
.@NCGOP To them, democracy ceases to hold value when it ceases to be a source of power.  This ideology must be fought with all the fight we have.
.@NCGOP The @NCGOP has shown that for a growing number of electeds, democracy is only valuable as a means to gain power...
.@NCGOP Many of us have always assumed democracy was a fundamental of Americanism.  Something etched in stone that is essential to our values.
.@NCGOP To the people of NC: there millions of Americans all across this country who stand with you.  Your voices are heard, and we stand with you.
.@NCGOP @ncgop and @PatMcCroryNC have announced loud and clear that thirst for power trumps democracy.  We should NEVER let them forget it.
.@NCGOP Americans of every political creed should be furious. @ncgop has shown they will do absolutely anything for power.  Nothing is beyond them.

@leilanialexa Thank you!
Tonight Clinton gave articulate, detailed responses. Trump spewed insults and never described any clear policies he would implement as POTUS
"How stupid is our country?"- Republican nominee for President of the United States.
1st amendment allows freedom of religion in America &amp; is one of the things that makes this nation great. Trump's answer seems to forget that
Trump just said if he was in charge of the law, Clinton would be in jail. Jailing your opponent is something dictators do.
Not locker room talk. This was sexual assault, objectifying women &amp; giving yourself a free pass for anything bc of your wealth and fame.
When Giuliani says Trump wants to move on to the important issues he's saying sexual assault &amp;violence against women aren't important issues
Yet only NOW do these *leaders* renounce him as "husbands and fathers."  Do us a favor and keep your fake shock and phony morality.  (2/2)
This lowlife treats people of color with contempt and has deliberately made our country more dangerous to be anything but a white man. (1/2)
In Trump's mind, fame &amp; wealth give him a free pass to sexually assault women. Completely disgusting &amp; unacceptable. https://t.co/AYxV4xUAOY
