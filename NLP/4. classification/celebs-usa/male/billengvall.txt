This Veteran‚Äôs Day pray for those who keep us safe and for those who have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. My family and I have you all in our hearts and prayers. #thankyou #USA
@MiMTkeMtucker @dallascowboys Finally, someone said it. Well done. I am afraid the cowboys will never have a great team as long as the stadium remains full. Why would he. I get that.
@RBL_M1A2Tanker @dallascowboys No offense taken my friend
@RBL_M1A2Tanker @dallascowboys You know what this is beyond childish names. I just want athletes that can do the job. I do not call other teams names.  Nor do I want people to call the team I root for names. This is not about other teams. It‚Äôs about the cowboys fielding a competitive team.
@1BIGJOE @dallascowboys Could not agree more. It is time for a change.
Well Cowboys fans, when is enough enough?  Are y‚Äôall happy with this basic mediocre? I mean I get it the stadium sell out every Sunday but why cannot we put a winning team on the field. If I am out of line let me know. I just want the @dallascowboys to be relevant again
@SpringByrum Thank you. That was very sweet.

The show is in Phoenix
This is the kind of show comedians dream about.
@kathleenmadigan This is pretty amazing
@kathleenmadigan
Sorry already mentioned Lewis just a huge fan
Oh wait also Steven wright,bobcat goldthwaite, Lewis black
Doing a show with Guido Sarducci, Tommy Smothers, Lewis Black, Kathleen Madigan and Dick Gregory. Unbelievable!!!
Plane landed safely, baby fell asleep, and all is well in the world. Except it's 100 degrees here in Phoenix. Should be a fun show.
You ever wonder what people are thinking when they are looking at open seats. It's like they are looking for secret southwest first class.
It always amazes me how the parents of screaming babies are deaf. Oh he is ramping it up now.  You go boy!!
And where does the screaming baby sit??? You got it...right across from me and apparently he brought his peeps with him.
Apparently southwests new slogan to the passengers is "you are now free to act like an idiot"
I am amazed at how many people fly that are just freaking clueless.  How did you get this far in life!!!!
Nothing says happy mothers day like a screaming baby in an airport
Apparently mothers day in America is also lets fly southwest day too. Sheesh where the hell is everyone going
So I am going through security at LAX and a TSA agent is asking me questions and he barely speaks English. Maybe that should be required.

@bitterb I am sorry that we can't have a difference of opinions. I do believe in the rights of all gun owners. Just don't care for ak-47s.
@michaelgkeeton thanks I am in no way backing gun control. I believe in our second amendment rights completely.
@michaelgkeeton that's great but my deer rifle won't shoot 60 bullets and I would hope I never need sixty bullets to harvest a deer
@michaelgkeeton I am not in favor of losing our rights to bear arms at all. I just don't care for ak-47 rifles that was all I was saying
@bitterb I am sorry that you feel that way. My comedy has nothing to do with my views on semi-automatic guns.
So excited to come back to Easton, PA this Thursday! I got the chance to chat with @lehighvalley about my show: http://t.co/G6mkMwa9

@Kokomoschmoe hahaha okay that's funny
@tattedupgirl really?? Shut up??  Sorta harsh
Okay so I figured out the similarity between big foot and the cowboys. They ain't finding Bigfoot and the cowboys may not find another win.
@Tom_Jones_n is he really your dad. I am not sure what wallet your talking about.
How Jerry Jones can sit and watch this garbage is beyond me

Apparently riding the dog like a horse is frowned upon in this establishment. Hahaha that one kills me.
Bring back the E Trade baby please. That kid is hysterical
And does that stupid Kia commercial really make you wanna buy one or drive those people off a cliff in a Kia.
If I hear one commercial where overly happy people sing Xmas songs and change the lyrics I am going to go postal

@dalebright, I didn't. Appreciate you being a fan.
Just saw a squirrel climb out of a tree wearing a parka,scarf and gloves. Cmon sun warm it up, warm it up
Okay I am an idiot. Why am I wearing camo in a fully enclosed deer stand. It's not like the deer can see through wood walls. Here's my sign
Hey deer pay mo attention to that man in camo sitting in a deer blind he is just taking pictures
Many of you have ask why tweet while hunting. A. It's safer than drinking and B. The deer are no where to be found.  Hence the tweeting.
@Smree u got that right
It's weird to be hunting and hear car horns and voices. Well maybe I shouldn't be hunting in a city park. Hahahahaha. Obviously joking.
OMG a deer just gave me the hoof. How rude!!
Okay if you have an iPhone there is a little arrow next to character count. Hit that and u will see a camera icon hit it and there u go.
Proof that I am where I said I am http://yfrog.com/5xbsv0j
Well back in the deer stand. There was a note. "we no yur hear". Apparently deer can't spell worth a dang.
Anyone know how to post pics on twitter. Need your help
Put a sign in my pants that said "what are you looking at" just for our friends at the TSA and their full body scanners.
Saw where someone entered a contest to win a toothbrush. Really? How can those people afford to give away a $1.98 grand prize.
Some people call this weather crisp others call it refreshing. I say it's just freaking cold. It's fresh.....shut-up
THIS Thursday - show in Las Vagas at Treasure Island! See you there?! http://on.fb.me/gts05B
So last night I awoke with a jolt because I heard something in the house. I checked nothing. It happened again. It was me snoring. Duh!!
Us back in the deer stand. Wind is blowing and it's cold. Dang deer are probably still snuggled in bed and laughing at me.
THURSDAY!! Show in Vegas at Treasure Island!! http://on.fb.me/gts05B
Okay a bird just landed in the window of my blind.  I think he was more freaked than I was. His face was like "OMG there is a man in here"
Jeez a squirrel just dropped an acorn on top of my deer blind scared the you know what out of me.
@okrmevet where are you enjoying the great outdoors
Sitting in the woods watching the world come to life. It's so peaceful, now if I can just get that big buck to cooperate.
@dalebright up what's up with that comment. Hahaha I think @ronwhite is funny to but no need for rude comments
Is sitting at the ranch enjoying the peace and quiet. Good news the cowboys can't lose today. I am happy
When is it okay to stop saying Happy Thanksgiving and start saying Merry Christmas OR does Happy Holidays trump Merry Christmas. hmmmmmm
Is sitting at airport at 5am wondering what idiot flies at this time of day.  Then it hit me, I am that idiot hahahaha!!!!
Alright you guys win, my dish wasn't that bad. I am going to bed and dream about the cowboys in the hey days.
It was like the sweet potatos were swimming in a butter jacuzzi.
Wants to know what was the worst thing you ate today. Mine was some kind of sweet potato mess a friend made.
Nothing screams holiday festiveness like standing in line to get into Target at 5 am. Really???
Man it's a good thing I am not a sports bettor. First the cowboys and now the Longhorns. Sheesh I would be broke.
Okay now that I mover being upset. I will apologize to the Cowboys and Miles Austin. Passion makes us say things (cont) http://tl.gd/75jk6n
Well at least we aren't as bad as Carolina. Happy Thanksgiving everyone.
Thank you Miles Austin we would give you the game ball bit you would probably drop it.
I am yelling cuss words that no one has ever heard before.
There are those awesome db's
Jeez I knew it. Just hold on to the dang ball
OMG if the boys win this I am seriously gonna do the pee pee dance
Believe it or not my love of the cowboys knows no bounds. That us why they upset me so much.
OMG this team is gonna give me a heart attack
Hey Dez Bryant grow up, shut up and be a team player. Now Jason Witten there is an old school player.
Could someone please tell Sensabaugh and Skandrik that the fame has started and they might wanna START PLAYING!!!
Happy thanksgiving to all the troops who cannot be home with their families. Thank you for your sacrifice.
If these guys make love like they play defense they have some very disappointed wives
Way to go cowboys go down and score and let the defense screw it up. 23-13 Saints.
Why do the Dallas Cowboys jump around celebrating when they make a good play.  Uh you might wanna look at the scoreboard. Just play ball!!
Good god the Dallas defensive backs couldn't cover a bed if you gave em a sheet.
Hopes all my twitter folks have the most blessed thanksgiving. I hope your families are happy and healthy.
