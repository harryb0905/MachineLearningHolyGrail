@leeapplbaum @JohannesvanOver @PatronESM @Patron What‚Äôs the bet?
@cyclesport @levisgranfondo No, they‚Äôre limited to 28mph so they won‚Äôt catch the fastest, most skilled riders (while they‚Äôre still in a large group) starting 20‚Äô ahead of them.
@KwmKen @levisgranfondo Try it before you make those kinds of statements. You pedal as hard as you want, you just go further. A 2hr workout is still the same 2hr workout you just cover more ground
If you haven‚Äôt ridden an e-bike try one before you form an opinion. I think they‚Äôre great for the sport and they‚Äôre so fun to ride. We at @levisgranfondo allow them to start at the back, for safety reasons as not to mix different skill levels. https://t.co/N0HMKkCnrR

@mdelane22 @UCI_cycling @petosagan If you watch the slow-mo of all available angles it's clear he didn't "throw" an elbow, it was a balancing act after the contact from Cav
@robertacree @UCI_cycling @petosagan I couldn't disagree more. He was balancing after the contact from Cav, his elbow never made contact with him
@QuadzillaXTR I really don't think this has an effect on their decision. The jury isn't all French, if any at all
It's just sad to see @UCI_cycling make such a costly mistake by DQing @petosagan Did they even watch all the angles in slow-mo?!

@EOD_K9 Hey there, thank you, I'm glad you liked it, I hope there's something good to take away from it!
@yuranation I think suspension saves energy, especially over long distances, I also prefer 29" despite added weight. I'm not biggest expert
@yuranation depends on the course, I'd lean towards more suspension over long distances, I prefer 29"

@GregMinnaar Oct 5. We have a dirt climb option now, you came with the Capo crew before right?
@chucklist you can crush everything with the big wheels
@pjrabice I flatted while in the lead with about 12' remaining but Carl was bearing down on me, it would have been very close. Fun time
@chucklist 48:52 clean, safe run. As fast as I could do it so it was good. Very fun
@ScottTedro @ghincapie @TheUSCup off road?
@MellivoraMom @Jdolph Congrats!
@GregMinnaar I was trying to get as much time as possible, had 4.5' on top, down to 1' when I flatted on 1st Divide, how are you? Fondo?
@ghincapie let's do a mtb trip, just have some fun
And congrats again to @deckerator for another win. Amazing combo of skill &amp; power. Also, everyone who attempted it, serious skills required
I had a lot of fun in the Downieville DH today, bikes are so amazing when you think about it. I highly recommend this event!
@thequeenofpain @fatcyclist @specializedwmn @SRAMmtb @Garmin @iamspecialized Sweet! Good luck Reba
@ghincapie What did I tell you! It's awesome right?
@sactoarmstrong wow, that's really cool, thanks for sending this
@chucklist uh, the record is 44 minutes dude!!
@chucklist Dude, it's so tough!
Congrats to @deckerator for the win today in Downieville. Much respect for him &amp; the top guys. Honored to lead it for so long.
@chuck_i @fatcyclist Downieville is the real deal Fatty, I think you need to check it off your list for sure
@fatcyclist that's part of the reason Downieville and Sierra Buttes is mtb nirvana. Great work by Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship

@YuriHauswald Tell Brian good luck for me
@i_am_kmac Congrats!
@DatSarp07 45' never did it %100 all out but that was pretty hard
@DatSarp07 seems like the injury from last year really slowed him down
@DatSarp07 to win the stage-a chance, the overall-extremely unlikely
@flopsy_mopsy oh thanks, I had a lot of fun &amp; I'm proud of what Burke has accomplished with such a unique event
@DatSarp07 no way, he's so lean!
@snaptphoto someone else's, not mine

@lucaseuser agreed
@DatSarp07 yeah they do, thanks, I had a few good ones

@DatSarp07 That's tough bcause there's a lot we don't see, guys like @GeraintThomas86 &amp; Stannard are on front a lot! GT w/ cracked pelvis!

@DatSarp07 is less steep with wind &amp; perspective of how far to go, yet you start to feel the altitude up there, last 200m breaks you
@DatSarp07 Ventoux, no question. The first half in the trees is brutal, steep, straight and no wind to cool you off or draft. Past Chalet R
@fatcyclist @tusharcrusher Did you finish yet? Wondering about your progress?? Go Fatty!
@ehjii @slctbird @tusharcrusher It was a great experience I'm still buzzing. You're right
Despite the result, I am CRUSHED!! What an epic event. Thank you @slctbird &amp; everyone at @tusharcrusher

@ptrkmrfy thanks
@DatSarp07 you're welcome. I've done my last TdF. I love watching it though.
@twrenegade @tusharcrusher Take it easy on us man! I'm excited for this adventure, see you Sat
@DatSarp07 way too many variables to predict the race w/ certainty but he's by far the strongest so far, I think he'll win
@PhilipMooney @twrenegade Why aren't you joining us? It's right up your alley, I've seen your off road prowess
@DatSarp07 not sure what you mean about Contador? Wiggo was the better TTer and last year favored that. No one knew Froome would be so good
@DatSarp07 They've developed into 5 star favorites while on Sky, we'll see if they remain on the same team?
@DatSarp07 No, but he's young, 1st TdF, he can do it someday. Don't expect so much from these young guys so soon, it takes years

@BrianLopes How's your back?
@davedtowle @levidocumentary You better believe it
@levisgranfondo @fatcyclist @thequeenofpain @patrickdempsey @k_armstrong Don't forget @tomdanielson
@thequeenofpain @fatcyclist @patrickdempsey teams should have 1 pro man, 1 pro woman &amp; 1 celeb. So only ? Is where to place you &amp; KA?
@thequeenofpain @fatcyclist @patrickdempsey I propose Team Levi: RR &amp; PD Team Fatty: KA &amp; TD. Maybe we should have fans/fundraisers pick?
@TrailGrinder @BikeMonkey ??
@PatrickDempsey Very cool
@zdenekstybar @iamspecialized That is awesome Styby. No discs?!
@nealrogers Ha. I did the same thing
@k_armstrong @exergytwenty12 No, fortunately we have the option of eating @SkratchLabs healthy rice cakes. C'mon it's for a good cause
Now we just need @k_armstrong to make the teams even. How about it Kristin? @ExergyTWENTY12
Breaking news @fatcyclist , @tomdanielson is also signed up for the pre @levisgranfondo Donut Race!
@timVcarls @fatcyclist @patrickdempsey @thequeenofpain Thanks for the support
@TiaMimoSF @fatcyclist ME!!
@gixxerflier thanks. I was trying to save characters on one and then got in the habit (bad) trying to do too many things at once
I think I just spotted this mysterious @fatcyclist boarding a plane for Utah http://t.co/zcNSNdHx
@VincentMGee You can be my coach then
@rockphins13 yes
@thequeenofpain @patrickdempsey @fatcyclist Yeah I thought that might be the case all of a sudden
@IronFletch @fatcyclist No problem, thanks
Just spoke to @PatrickDempsey while he was busy on set. Great news! He's in on the Donut Race w/ @fatcyclist and I
.@PatrickDempsey, since you‚Äôll be @levisgranfondo next week you should come do the Donut Race w/ @FatCyclist and I  http://t.co/hlf61NOI
.@TheQueenOfPain You sure you don‚Äôt want to come?
.@TheQueenOfPain How about if we gave you a perk? Like, you get to pick what kind of glaze goes on the donuts
.@TheQueenOfPain It‚Äôs because @FatCyclist weirds you out, isn‚Äôt it? He has that effect on people. Don‚Äôt worry, my people will restrain him
.@TheQueenOfPain You sure about that? It should be a REALLY UNUSUAL event, for a bunch of good causes.
.@TheQueenOfPain I hear you‚Äôre going to be @levisgranfondo next week. While you‚Äôre in town, you should do the Donut Race w/ @FatCyclist &amp; I
‚Äú@fatcyclist: Yesterday, @LeviLeipheimer and I had an "interesting exchange." Today, I formalize the challenge:  http://t.co/hlf61NOI‚Äù
@robbellbottom @fatcyclist Don't worry, I've got a plan
‚Äú@tomdanielson: Check out what my @dempchallenge coach has to say about the event on @BicyclingMag http://t.co/rJRYmOKi‚Äù 20/20s?! Really?
.@fatcyclist My people will be in contact with your people
.@fatcyclist A race combined w/ a donut eating contest. I‚Äôm not surprised. If I do this &amp; you lose, I get to put you in a headlock again?
@pdx_heatherbeth @fatcyclist You're onto something
@JnglstTICAL It's all good. Keep watching/reading
Fine, @fatcyclist. We do a race combined with an eating contest.
‚Äú@BrontenanaJames: @fatcyclist @LeviLeipheimer so cycling very very quickly, then sitting under a bridge in time-honoured troll fashion?"
.@fatcyclist Sounds stupid but whatever. What are your "strengths" anyway? Eating?
I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt want to even know how you could, @fatcyclist.
.@fatcyclist That's the single dumbest thing I've ever read. I read it to three other people. It‚Äôs the dumbest thing they‚Äôve heard too.
.@fatcyclist So you‚Äôd be faster at racing if you weren‚Äôt so good at other stuff. Whatever that other stuff is.
.@fatcyclist No, I meant WTF about you hoping you'd still be fast in a decade. When will you START racing fast?
‚Äú@fatcyclist: In fact, I‚Äôll go so far as to say @LeviLeipheimer gives me hope that I‚Äôll still be racing strong a decade from now.‚Äù WTF?
@rmatthes @gpRivieraRistor
‚Äú@opqscyclingteam: #OPQS WINS THE WORLDS TTT! BY 3.16"! #limburg2012‚Äù  Saw this coming back in January, congratulations guys!!

@tomdanielson You deserve it dude.
@Greghenderson1 one of the best teammates ever
@Greghenderson1 A certain Tour of Portugal stage winner
@nealrogers I love these details and nuances of competition and our sport. Never stop learning and honing
@nealrogers I know that. Like I said, I enjoy the back and forth
@nealrogers Our jobs are 24/7, especially during stage races
@nealrogers Don't forget that what we say affects tactics and competitors mentalities. Race isn't over when we cross the finish line
@nealrogers I know. That came out wrong, not saying you don't, just saying we strive to represent positivity &amp; healthy competition
And for everyone who journeyed out to cheer us on. I hope you enjoyed one of the biggest battles ever on US soil. Congrats @ChristianVDV
Yes I'm disappointed, but at peace w/ my effort. I wore my heart on my sleeve last two days. I have a lot of love &amp; respect for this sport
@nealrogers Thanks. I always enjoy the back and forth. You can keep trying to bait us but we love and respect the sport too much
@Zipp_USA @opqscyclingteam @quarq @sramontheroad Flying the 303s up the "Flag"
@Mattbrammeier85 Ha, thanks Brammy
@PatrickDempsey Thanks for coming Patrick
Thank you Golden and Boulder for an unforgettable day. I'm lost for words to describe the crowds and your enthusiasm
Will tomorrow's stage @USAProChallenge surpass the attendance of last year's Golden-Denver stage? Today was impressive
@taylorphinney Amen brother!
Hey @thejensie , now we can ski Vail-Beaver Creek together for the rest of our lives, once you finally retire in 6 years or so!
Thnx @USAProChallenge for taking care of us. Great food (by @BijuTheChef ), hotels &amp; safe routes. I could race til 50 under these conditions
@tomdanielson Congrats. That was epic
@blick @mattbrammeier85 Keeping us fresh and in style!
JMac wins in Portugal!! Love that guy
And another brave performance from a compromised @opqscyclingteam today. Thanks guys!
Got boxed in on the right as the TJ express went on left. Still a lot of racing left. . .
Good article re: car vs. bicycles in Santa Rosa's Press Democrat. Be Safe! http://t.co/eZeOWf5i

@podiuminsight @adena510 @totalcyclist you definitely misunderstood me, neither the climb nor the ToU were too hard
‚Äú@BenKing89: Thanks to everyone who worked all year to make @theTourofUtah such a great race. Mission accomplished.‚Äù  http://t.co/1cbpdHkV
@PatLefevere "Thank you Patrick" is the answer!! @opqscyclingteam
@ChristianVDV I know. I was cursing myself the last 5km of the climb
One last post to point out the peace sign from 1 of the coolest cats around, Brian Holm  http://t.co/5jXFnifU
Many people asking me about gearing today. Now that the secret is out re: Empire Pass I can tell you I used SRAM's WiFli 11-32 for 1st time
Thank you to all the fans who journeyed out to Empire Pass &amp; PC! You make it epic. #1 for the day! http://t.co/RPFucGWC
I ran that scenario thru my mind every time I trained that climb, felt great to pull it off. Had severe cramps on the DH, &amp; I never cramp
@pjrabice @tiffanycraven Who's belt buckle did you borrow for that pic?   Great Job PJ!
Didn't expect Tschopp to be so strong, thought I could bring him back at the end for the stage win. F√©licitations Johan &amp; BMC.
@YuriHauswald Where's Sauser?
Congratulations to fellow NorCal training partner @andrewtalansky for winning in France. He's on his way
I totally forgot to wish everyone good luck participating in the @LTRaceSeries today. Anyone else have updates?
@d0gmah Which pros are you talking about?
@d0gmah @rabobank @levisgranfondo Sorry, I still don't understand what you mean?

@fatcyclist Good Luck, break a leg. . .
We are lucky to have these world class races here in the US, they mean a tremendous amount to the sport in this country.
I'm grateful to @opqscyclingteam @SRAMontheroad @Zipp_USA &amp; @iamspecialized for making it possible to do @theTourofUtah &amp; @USAProChallenge
‚Äú@theTourofUtah: Ogden Amphitheater hosts Team Presentation Ceremony tonight 7-9 pm." Happy to be here for 3rd straight year, see you there
@anthonyno That is the real me, I love all things bikes &amp; if I see something cool &amp; it's also a sponsor then of course I'm going to say it
I'm looking forward to riding my Mt Bikes, have you seen this new XX1 group? So clean &amp; simple. http://t.co/tYzDvOVs
@LeipheimerFan Not true, I created a list that you are on

@pjrabice Then I wouldn't have to unfollow you! When's the race?
@pjrabice @thequeenofpain Suck it up Rabice
@pjrabice That's what I'm here for. A little fear is good
@pjrabice Good Luck, you'll need it!
@youngrodstewart Sweet!!
Congratulations to @k_armstrong Retiring on top &amp; setting a great example. She's humble, gracious, hard working, focused &amp; a good person

@MattLarson70 Not true, this is a problem w/ social media- misinterpretation
In contrast to yesterday, there are no war stories from today, except for the cold, wet winter weather. All's good at @opqscyclingteam
@MapMyRIDE @allwhiteseggs That sounds good
@jwcraw I love them both, as well as Mont where I was born. We are lucky!
Also, I want to wish @ghincapie well in his last season. I'm proud to have been his teammate, contemporary &amp; always a friend.

Thank you to everyone for all the messages. I'll keep you informed
There's no official diagnosis yet, I need more tests. This is one of those mornings when feeling like I got run over is actually true

Congratulations to @bradwiggins for a flawless Paris Nice. Hats off to him & Team Sky for showing everyone how it's done.

We save our energy anyway we can [pic] ‚Äî http://t.co/JZbFk8HT
The peloton was in pieces after only 5km today, stayed that way for over an hour. You know it's hard when Valverde has to bridge alone!
It's been an honor to have @opqscyclingteam supporting me here in Paris Nice. Kevin DeWeet gave me a red carpet ride into Mende today.
Hats off to Sky's Ritchie Porte today, great ride by a nice guy. Mende isn't my favorite climb so I'm optimistic for the rest of the race
@ShaneBresnyan It's from trying to keep up with you
@BrianLopes Chapter 3 I believe?
@i_am_kmac exactly
Had to pull out some daredevil acrobatic maneuvers in a roundabout at @70kph w/ 3km to go, hopping 2 curbs & over the grass. Got lucky
@leeapplbaum @radioshack You've had a positive impact not only on the RS brand Lee. Thank you for everything! ForgetMeNotFarm thanks you
Also, I'm getting a lot of questions in the peloton about @iamspecialized & new @SRAMontheroad Red. Let's just say its good to be a pro!!
It's not always apparent on TV the work riders do in the race so its worth noting that everyone on @opqscyclingteam is pulling their weight

‚Äú@leeapplbaum: Going to give away a signed @TeamRadioShack jersey to one of my followers as a thx.‚Äù #WhenInFrance
Summary of my day: slept 12hrs, rode 1hr, ate a billion calories, finished watching "Breaking Bad" and now getting massage. #tdf part trois
Fast tailwind stage today, we were doing 77kph (48mph) on flat road at one point, completely spun out.
You win some, you lose some. Important thing is to move on & look ahead to another goal down the road, thanks for all the cheers!
#WhenInFrance @RadioShackLive is exploring, reporting and rewarding. Follow them for laughs and some great gifts. http://t.co/xCYSUKA
@RoadID Better ramp up production for our household!
@peterstetina exactly
‚Äú@TeamRadioShack: Keep fighting @levileiphiemer @andykloedi @markelirizar @sergiopaulinho Dimi & Hamiar. Thx to our fans!"
@levisgranfondo The boss is holding down the fort!
I keep hearing about these "commercials" from @MapMyRIDE & @RoadID on Versus TV back home? Should I be worried?

@peterstetina Sweet! See you in a couple weeks man
@tomdanielson Sprinting by Braille
Finally a smooth day here at the #TdF There was a crash that I had to sort of lay down on top of but other than that it's all good
@brentbookwalter @ghincapie @craiglewis85 Like the trails in Annadel!
Deluge of rain and hail just before the start of stage 10. #TdF
@pjrabice @robinjthurston @leeapplbaum @mapmyride I'll have to wait til I get to my dvr I suppose
I think Johnny and Flecha deserve more than the "Most Aggresive" award.
‚Äú@Greghenderson1: Win or lose you will never regret working hard, making sacrifices, being disciplined or focusing too much. -John Smith.‚Äù
Another bad day for @TeamRadioShack as 6 of us crashed. #runningoutofclothing
It could be worse w/ all my bad luck here at #TdF, I'm happy to still be in the race. Crashes are a part of cycling but this is crazy!
Sums it up #tdf  http://instagr.am/p/HJlP6/
Be safe out there fellow cyclists! RIP Carly. Enough is enough
@sacca It was war man
‚Äú@Scotty_G1962: @LeviLeipheimer The UCI should be concerned about safety and the roads and less about saddle tilt!‚Äù Wise words
Jani was not as lucky, unfortunately he's out w/ what may be a broken collarbone. These roads don't belong in the Tour, especially 1st week
Nothing nice to say about today. Don't know what hit me but I got run over big time! Had to throw everything away 'cept shoes & glasses
My wife's cycling clothing The Gunn Collection is now available, proceeds go to The Humane Society. #Proud #Style http://t.co/KxGD76S
Stuck in gridlock on the way back to the hotel, it's going to be a late night.
That was stressful; intermediate sprint, windy bridge, nervous peloton. Congratulations Tyler! Way to make it the 4th of July in France dude
Happy 4th of July to all my friends back home! Hope everyone is having fun
‚Äú@philmaertens: Yellow jersey for @TeamRadioShack today. @RobbieHunter wins first stage in Tour of Austria.‚Äù Congrats Robbie! #greatteammate
‚Äú@craiglewis85: Versus should give @robbieventura some more camera time‚Äù RV always brings positive energy
That was over fast! A bit of a disappointment for us but could have been worse I suppose. We are a team of diesels, started too slow
@RedHourBen Are you guys stopping by this year?
Made it through stage 1 unscathed, got caught behind the crash 2km to go, but given main group's time 6" behind superman Gilbert. #daybyday

Thank you to AEG and Medalist for supporting this decision. We all hope the fans understand
We the riders are disappointed about not racing for the fans but we all agreed it was too risky in the ever changing weather.
Please check out the teaser on my new site at www.levination.com. Feel free to send us feedback

@manuelquinziato Uh dude, Roubaix ain't tomorrow!
@BrianLopes @ghincapie You'll rock that sh&t, I've seen you muscle up King Ridge with @MaxPlaxton and Sneddon, just 7 days of it!
@Halfwheeling absolutely, they are both ripping it up (back to West Coast speak)
Kl√∂di macht schnell in Baskenland! Hop Hop!
Looks like we will be Basque(ing) in the sun today on stage #2. Not how I remember this race but I'll take it!
This event is forging into new territory, it looks cool to me. Great job @slctbird http://t.co/97SrqkW
@Greghenderson1 That's cuz you didn't stay in the tube bro
@BikeMonkey Now that is sick!
Sebastian Rosselar keeps the ball rolling! TT and Overall of "Three Dogs" as the Americans call it.
@sacca And bikes cost you your first born!
On the mend. Rode the bike and the legs are still good, stomach is still a little sore though. Good time to rest as it's pouring out
@RadioShack Cool to see The Shack now has the trifecta of Apple mobile devices. MacBooks next?
Spending the day on the couch and eating again. I'll be back at Pays Basque, after some recovery.
@davedtowle Thanks for that support Dave, nice to hear.
Thank you to my @TeamRadioShack teammates for all their hard work, I'm sorry to let you down!
Really disappointed to fall ill on the last day of @VoltaCatalunya Believe me I'd race if I could, but I'm down for the count

I should say however that the hotel is nice and in a beautiful setting here in Andorra. Also, I felt good today, that's all.
You know your hotel has been closed for awhile when you turn on the faucet and the water comes out looking like beer
In the car w/ @eki_ekimov after stage #2 here in @VoltaCatalunya  Got to stop at home after the stage to drop off some gear
@RoadID I'll wear white
@gpRivieraRistor woah! Which road is that? Mill Station?

Another very tricky stage to end PN, they threw every curve in Nice at us today. I'd say it was a good week for @teamradioshack
@gpRivieraRistor Grazie GP
@LeipheimerFan Sorry to hear that. Rest up and take care of yourself
@brentbookwalter Yeah yeah, everyone was in the hurt locker dude.
Dead men walking today in PN. It was every man for himself trying to stay upright and out of trouble, we came out relatively unscathed
@tvangarderen88 Geen Probleem. It clearly helped, you did a great job on the last climb for Tony
11 years after winning Paris Nice, @AndyKloedi wins the stage and takes the yellow jersey. The morale in the team is high to say the least.
Amazing story of 2 dogs my wife is helping rescue & adopt.  http://t.co/7ZJGAxy
@EthanSuplee Cool! Thanks for the support Ethan, I'm a big fan of yours
@EthanSuplee nice choice
Broken equipment is easily and safely managed in the race thanks to radios. The real chaos is behind the Peleton!
Back at base camp, aka Campanile, after a crazy stage in PN. At one point, I had 1 white shoe and 1 black shoe.
@FatherSonTour great! See you there guys
Speaking of bragging. My wife designed this new @levisgranfondo jersey, it's "sick". http://t.co/dOPWZA9
Jinxed myself today by bragging that I couldn't remember the last time I was in a Campanile
I can't get enough of the Black Keys
@Greghenderson1 Good job dude. Not easy to be the fastest guy in our neighborhood let alone PN!
When the Peleton is gutter to gutter and there's no breakaway you'd think that means it's easy right? Wrong! Looks can be deceiving.
‚Äú@philmaertens: @jessesergent wins Overall 3 Days of West Flanders. Teammates Rosseler & Kwiatkowski 2nd & 3rd. Congrats @TeamRadioShack !‚Äù
@MaidinWales thanks
@GarageWW they are often early, problem today was that it wasn't early enough and we were behind schedule, can be hectic
It's been a hectic 1st day of PN, anti-doping control at breakfast time, transfers and wind! Happy the weather is good & none of us crashed
‚Äú@Markelirizar: Today 1h easy ride.good weather in France‚Äù Welcome to Twitter Markel.
Rolling in the team bus with the Paris Nice crew. Weather is sunny & dry, forecast looks good too!

It's great to see the riders and teams unified today in Mallorca & race w/ radios. Easy to criticize if you've never been in the peleton
Feeling better! Saw 80 degrees on my SRM today, as well as a couple hundred cyclists on the road. Shorts & short sleeves feels great!
@wichecerra SRAM of course, the lightest group out there!
@ScottNydam @gprivieraristor Ouch! You gonna take that GP?
Anyway, I'll be back soon. Good luck guys and have a good time in Mallorca!
I'm really disappointed to miss @teamradioshack training camp, got pretty sick just before I was s'posed to leave, need to rest up now

These Canadian ProTour races have been a huge success! Hope to see them continue for many years
Great team effort today in Montreal. Everyone rode aggressive and tried to make the race hard. Another fantastic crowd too! Thank you
Great race today in Quebec City, especially the crowds. The circuit was a technical "leg breaker". Looking forward to Mont Royal!
I love to show people the Sonoma County lifestyle, this "Festa" just before the Gran Fondo is my chance. http://ow.ly/i/3GvL/original
Very wet 3 hr ride here in Quebec this morning with the guys- strong team! Our hotel is very impressive, @andykloedi would approve
@levisgranfondo That looks great, please pass along my compliments to the art dept
On my way to Quebec and then Montreal for the new ProTour races, Mont Royal circuit should be tough
@ScottNydam Sweet! That should be entertaining. Good luck and have a great time, we'll miss you

Anyone in Nor Cal doing So No Mas? http://sonomas.bikemonkey.net/ Looks cool
@suzzi4u Thank you
@AliceFalla My advice: go to local Trek dealer due to lots of variables, have fun!
When pre-riding tough & isolated @LevisGranFondo route, pls be careful on Hauser Bridge! It's a technical, black diamond descent!
The fans lining the final climb to Snowbird made the @theTourofUtah a great race! You should be proud of yourself Terry.
A pic of yesterday's TT by my friend Eric Schramm, great lighting. http://bit.ly/d2i1gn Notice my make-shift skinsuit, ha!
That was for you Terry
The transition from the Mt Bike to the TT bike was a tough one today at the Tour of Utah. Trek/ Livestrong ripped it up, 1st and 2nd!
Back on the grid after a cell phone black hole at 12Kft.
Thanks to the volunteers, promoters, sponsors and the fans for providing such an epic event, really great for cycling.
That was so damn hard! One of the harder days I've ever had on a bike. Everyone who competes in the @LTrail100 is tough as nails!
@techknowgn Yep

Almost 2 decades at the top of the sport, US Cycling has exploded in that time! Thanks @lancearmstrong  http://yfrog.com/2pgm3rmj
Having a great time out to dinner with the team
Felt like a kite out there today, had to use my super strong upper body to fight the bike. #sarcasm
@ghincapie Ditto
Getting massage after stage #? I've lost count. Massive crowds again today, thanks to all the fans who showed up along the route!
The TdF had taken it's toll.  http://yfrog.com/n389qqj
@gpRivieraRistor Can't wait to come in and see it!!
I was definitely the nail today, countersunk!
@AStarnes Sorry to hear about your crash, I hope it's not too serious?
My video from today's rest day, testing out a new bike!  http://bit.ly/9rWzRs
Quote of the day "That was the hardest 'start' of any TdF stage I've done" -@GHincapie (15x TdF)
Personally I felt better today but I was definitely in the "cave" trying to follow a furious @Andy_Schleck over the top of the Port de Bales
I'm happy to have great mechanics on our team including my good friend @gef73 because it's brutal out there!
@ScottNydam Well said!
My homies back in Sonoma County have been busy making @levisgranfondo bigger and better for 2010, check it- http://ow.ly/2cSvw
Vino was on the rampage at the end today, that was a serious display of power. Also by the 3 in front all day. Made for a tough stage.
We just received a sweet care package from California!  http://yfrog.com/b5abuvnj
@TeamRadioShack now leading team GC. Nice.. (via @lancearmstrong)
Not my best day, but I can be happy with losing only a few seconds. Rodriguez wins even after cartwheeling into a ditch at 60km on descent!
@gpRivieraRistor Burnside
Thanks to the team I was on the right end of that broken rubber band
Slow, hot day here in the TdF, until 30km or so to go, then the peloton stretched out like a rubber band, & broke.
Everyone's training for @LevisGranFondo, but 12 people get to do it with @ScottNydam, Dr. Max Testa & I  http://eepurl.com/IEeN

Someone threw a grenade in the peloton today. Oh yeah it was @Andy_Schleck
Just received my message from the Livestrong @chalkbot! Check it out: http://bit.ly/9INWZB or send your own here: http://bit.ly/chlkbot
One of the best rest days I've ever had in the TdF: slept in, great ride, good food, massage, chiro, movie, compressed the legs & horizontal
I think that was harder than everyone expected. Has anyone noticed my shoes? Equipment tech experts? http://yfrog.com/jbzf2wj
@AStarnes Good Luck!
Can you believe it?? This is now our hotel bed! As you can see, we are not football players. http://yfrog.com/hqewszj (via @andykloedi)
We finally have AC in our hotel rooms! Oh, and bunk beds. . .
@AmgenTourofCali Santa Rosa, obviously!!
Another smooth, hot day here in the TdF. Saw the sprint on TV afterwards, @MarkRenshaw1 did an impressive leadout for Cav
It was an epic stage today, stress level was very high. It didn't turn out how we hoped. Lance, Klodi & I all flatted but that's bike racing
Just read that I "blamed" the rider protest on ban of TV in the directors car  Really?? Pretty sure VS has the footage to clear that up
CARNAGE!
I'm very relieved to report that despite a lot of pain in my wrist nothing is broken!! Pain I can handle
Just had some x-rays taken. . .
Happy 4th of July to all the American Cycling Fans!!
Hit the deck today after someone brought their dog to the race w/o a leash. Indescribable how many people were out on the course!!
@YuriHauswald Happy Birthday!
@gregmfisher Congratulations you guys!
My prologue is done, satisfied with my ride, typical slow start but finished strong and most importantly stayed safe on the wet course
I have a few minutes to chill in the bus right now before I start the warmup to my 8th TdF prologue. Not as many as @ghincapie!
I've been "off the grid" for over a day waiting for my newly activated iPhone 4 from @radioshack, it was worth the wait!

TdS is over and @teamradioshack finished well w/ @lancearmstrong 2nd, @andykloedi 8th and me 10th. Things look great for Tour de France
JMac on positive thinking "At least we got lucky on the big Mt stage". As it's raining in Biblical proportions
@DMBlackstock Depends on tire rating and rider weight but I like 100/front 105/rear
My SRM said 5200 meters of climbing for today's stage, otherwise known as 17,000 ft! No, that's not a typo. Hurting
Check out this emerald river here in Switzerland.  http://yfrog.com/13onolj
Today is the kind of day to appreciate a perfectly functioning bicycle, thnks to our mechanics. No time to deal with anything but surviving
I agree with @dzabriskie. Where'd summer go?

Ridiculous final few km here in TdS, really hope everyone is ok after that horrible crash!
@kboje thanks
@WilsonTran let it completely heal before you push it on the bike, much better in the long run. Stay strong!
Make that @schleckfrank, yeah my mistake thinking his first name would be BEFORE his last name! Anyway, he was the last man standing
It was game on 4 the final circuit today in Swiss, an old western shootout won by the cowboy from Luxembourg @frankschleck. Congrats Pard

Congrats to @MickRogers for taking the jersey here at ToC and making it a very tight race. What's going to happen tomorrow? Predictions?

Paris-Nice Stage One: http://blog.oregonlive.com/horner/2010/03/chris_horners_team_radioshack.html (via @hornerakg)
Dirk DeMol said the wind picked him up off the ground while he was going @75kph on the downhill.
Unofficially 3rd in Paris Nice Prologue. Cold and WINDY!!! You may have heard our boy Geert Steegmans crashed very hard.
This is 1 of the best Mt Bike vids I've seen, got it from @christianvdv. http://tinyurl.com/yjlqz2z Now back 2 concentrating on Paris Nice
@NickyHayden69 You're in Malaysia right? Good luck, love to come see you race sometime man
@swing8 They don't speak French in Spain
On my way to Paris with JJ Haedo, he's acting as my handler, translating and all. Paris Nice starts Sunday
@darylimpey You're knocking on the door Daryl, good luck to you and the rest of the team this week!
@RobbieHunter Congrats Robbie and good luck the rest of the week.
@telebears you crushed me! The video was a lot funnier before they edited it
My hometown newspaper, The Press Democrat has a new "Bicycling Sonoma" section, good info 4 visitors & locals. http://tinyurl.com/yzkwnn8
C'mon USA! I now a lot of Canadians that will never let us forget it if they beat us, including the one I live with!
@brentbookwalter Never hit the dirt over here, I've heard it's not bad but I doubt it's as good as Annadel.
Met a local here in Girona who's ridden Annadel State Park back home in Santa Rosa, he's obviously a very cool guy.
@mickrogers Congratulations Mick
@jlchappy730 Thank you
Time Trial is finished here in Algarve, I wasn't bad but not great either. Seba 3rd and me 4th. Tiago 3rd on GC, I was again 4th.
@Lammerding Thank you
@Yorkie7 Short hair "deer" Chihuahua. Thanks  http://yfrog.com/4aimuyj
@winecountrydog Thank you
@jaowen Thank you
Time gap to the breakaway was 3.5 min w/ 30km to go w/ 2 teams chasing hard, 10km later it was 4 min to Sebastian by himself! Today was hard
@andrewtalansky Nice! Have fun dude
Uh yeah that just happened!! Sebastian Rosseler scores the 1st @teamradioshack victory of 2010. I tell you. That was impressive! Wow!
@tim_murakami Thank you, appreciate that!
@boydjerry yes it does, thank you!
@tvangarderen88 Ha! That's cuz your dad used to beat up on me, probably right around '88!!
Uphill finish today in Algarve, @teamradioshack 2nd & 3rd (Tiago and myself). The Pistolero fired right from the bottom.
@lancearmstrongr One has nothing to do with the other, don't assume it was meant for you
@IRMTBR Its 2010, news is reported in real time all over the Internet.
@janibrajkovic How am I not surprised?
@Mousquetonplume yes indeed
6 hours 10 minutes in freezing rain despite being a hop, skip & a jump from Africa
Tough times.
What an amazing Olympic day for Lindsey Vonn and Julia Mancuso. http://bit.ly/cZXl5R (via @usskiteam)
Tomas/ @triratuxs is ok!! He also has a new website with a sick video www.tomasvaitkus.com. Meet Tomas the Tank
Stage 1 of Algarve done, our man Tomas Vaitkus crashed hard and is getting a check up at the hospital. He finished but is banged up.
Watched the entire Men's Downhill. Congratulations on Bronze Bode. Only .09" out!!
Up early, heading to Portugal w/ @sergiopaulinho, Klodi, Rasta, Sebastian, Gert Steegmans, Tiago, @triratuxs, & Ace for Tour of Algarve
@slctbird Good Luck! Of course now that bikes are 5lbs lighter with more gears, etc. it should be easy right:)
Cold but crystal clear day here in Calpe, Spain for @teamradioshack training camp. We rode 180km/115miles on some very nice roads.
@slctbird Lots of funny footage was cut unfortunately, guess they wanted something serious?
Easy day here in Calpe at the @teamradioshack training camp. We rode 200 mountainous kilometers yesterday, great training around here.
Otherwise I always wear my helmet and I encourage everyone to wear their's as well as a @RoadID. Thanks for looking out for me.
Had a few Qs from people about why I wasn't wearing a helmet yesterday. My luggage didn't arrive until afternoon and no spares in the truck
@jsantos10701 yes
@Billy_Blogger depends on your rig? Maybe just new wheels?
@totallytallpaul They say you shouldn't have a bigger calorie deficit than 300/day
@rkrug20 my luggage didn't arrive first day, no extra helmets in the truck, felt naked without it.
Bwayn uhhs no chaze. Day 1 of camp is done; anti-doping test, 3.5 hour ride, massage, eating & trying to stay awake. Exciting stuff.
Bwaynos Deeos from Kalpay. That's a glimpse of just how well I speak Spanish.
New RadioShack Giro helmets look great.  http://yfrog.com/4fw8ezj
I should say that @The_Shack is a true partner considering the amount of support they have shown for @TeamRadioShack and @LevisGranFondo
That means everyone riding @levisgranfondo will be a part of Team RadioShack!!
Big news!! RadioShack is the presenting sponsor of the 2010 @levisgranfondo.
@slctbird A good friend;) schedule is on grasshopperadventureseries.blogspot.com
@carlrroach Yeah sorry about that, should have told you guys to at least turn the volume down. I thought it was in good spirit though.
@slctbird I did. It was a bast

@ndessandrock I've spent time on that Army base
@dylancasey yeah that was wet and cold
It rained HARD last night & this morning but it hasn't been like the Norcal Pineapple Express from the 96/97 winter, anyone remember that?
@EmpireReport No
@geralde I use rollers, put my bike on them, they're good for balance and riding smooth
Strolled thru a handful of counties on today's ride. Now it's time to dust off the rain bike, maybe build an ark? We've got enough animals!
If you have ideas how to ease tension between motorists/cyclists, send them to @roadid, they are compiling/publishing a list.
@slctbird WTF!
@tinalwong It's underground stuff. . .
