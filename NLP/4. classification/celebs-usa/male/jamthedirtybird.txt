There are guys like Bryant, and guys like Robert Alford you'll miss. Rocky started here. If you ride for the squad you've supported and cheered for his success from the jump. A career highlight in the Bowl. Hard to see guys with 6 &amp; 10 years depart. Wish them all the best
I'll never get this side of the business. But I understand, it's a business. If my decision, I stick w/Money. What a career! Alas, Farewell Matt Bryant. Wishing you, Melissa &amp; the kids all the best. You are a wonderful family. I have no doubt you will kick well next season! 🙏🏾😥
@_Jon_Hayward @thee5ivester Its quite a tradition and we are thrilled to have him! I've been tracking him for sometime, quite the talent. Thrilled to have him, especially with Moss back to lead the way. Lights out! #GoUtes 🙌🏽

@FalconsRealist Exactly. But are you surprised?!
@AbstractPoetic1 For real man. Cray cray
Congratulations to the Patriots. Brady stands alone. 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I shall remain believing the Rams for whatever reason abandoned Gurley in the playoffs. Or he didn't step up. I will find out. They reverted to last years product? No? But McVay got a coaching chain lol. Yall are hilarious.
Happy for Sony Michel to close this thing out in Atlanta. You can't even hate on the Dawg. And David Andrews leading the way, again. Andrews is an unsung hero and on the verge of another title with Brady. From nowhere. Earned it. Respect.
That was the tempo. Look how they moved down the field until that INT. Sheesh.
Speed it up Rams. Speed it up. Missing shots
What I respect.  Brady is just as happy to hand it off down there. Even though he got them down there. No matter. Points. Win. Team.
As the crowd was chanting "Brady, Brady....." it felt inevitable. Points coming.
Only a Patriot can get away with that hit?! No call. Lmao.
Yeah that was tight. Dude has been clutch since he arrived. Massive respect for my "cousin" CJ. #Andersonboys 🙌🏽🙏🏾 https://t.co/YdlXJDC3qU
OMG!!! Whew. Still no Gurley
3-3. No points in this bitch. Sound like a southern anthem 😭😭
@malanjaye @Cheshe72 @lilybrowder Not a chance. That was on my parenting docket. You should have and would have known 3000 who was. I blamed ya Moms and the 3 years of county music you endured. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Gotta respect the game. Edelman is a grown man.
@TheRCDavis Highly debatable 🙄😑😜
Woke up for Big Boi!!!!! Dont matter. ATL Legend.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz https://t.co/mtjadWx2oc
Its Space. Take the time.
All the Rams needed!!! A stop. Major. Dont know from here if Gronk should have been the look
Huge down there. Gave up alot. Ut not the 1st. Decision time. Especially given game time. Field position
@StickToPizza IDK what the hell is happening. But I am mystified
I expect a certain level of proficiency from Belichick. I mean come on, 9 trips here. To the Championship?!? GOAT status. Period. You want to be a legend. Beat a legend.
Waiting for the genius offensive plays to occur. Especially involving Gurley. 🙄
@WarrenSapp Not from the Jump 99. They wasnt hyped. For real thou. But Last minute. Hahahah
The locals are for sure not in here tonight lol. Ain't nobody from the ATL cheering for the Pats. Not a chance. Not a real one. 💯😑 https://t.co/uFgipnmtPJ
For sure a Patriots crowd.
The Rams got here with Todd Gurley in a near MVP roll. Its so odd to see him relegated. Again. Like WTH is going on?!?!?
@atlsuperbowl53 Blush away it was earned. Haha. Proud of the city. Well done. Very well done. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Get over the stadium esthetics fast. Make plays faster. Regardless of location of the game, the field hasn't changed since we were kids. 100 yards with paint. Make is simple. Keep it moving. Make plays. #SuperBowl

I don't see an issue with him being in the game at the time. This is the league. Game was far from over. Further, if Belichick was his coach you'd be screaming in an empty hallway. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Melvin Gordon being hurt is a major bummer though. He's been balling this year.
That alarm was extra loud this morning lol. Good day, good people. Championship week! Let's go! Ha
@UteYak I will most certainly recognize you because of keeping up with your progress. Proud of you.  🙏🏽

The crowd screaming overrated. Welp.
Buckeyes putting in that work. No doubt. This is still such a disappointing performance from the Wolverines.
Neither one of those defenders were  trying to hit him like that. They better not give anyone a targeting call
@bezy_bby We drafted his dad, it's possible. Hoping for the best for him.
Hate to see Bush injured.  🙏🏽
@therealpattman I'm also watching that game at the same time lol. OSU trying to give it away. Second half going to be lit.
The Dawgs did not come to mess around.
Wazzu. 😩
👊🏽 I'll do it again. Next time with some notice. Ha! https://t.co/lJUemCKYPo
Turning my attention to Rivalry weekend. I dont have the energy for this lol. Be best, good people.
@SlopingGiraffe There were some plays last night where I was like.... What the f**k is Matt doing?! Not saying it was all him. But I dont think some of the criticism was unfair. Also think he was dismayed by the overall performance of the team given their situation.
@SlopingGiraffe Ok. Fine.  So you've been pleased with what you've seen from the offense the past 3 games? I'll wait .....
@DjPrettybOyTank 😩😩😩😩😩😩😬😬😬😬
@CriMson_Tide28 Yeah. Issues. But there were moments that were not on them. And as he said with the season on the line he expected the former MVP to make plays to ignite his team and it didn't happen.
It's hilarious to me that ya'll mad at Rodney. He live in the city. He surrounded by the hype. I bet he didn't think it was gonna be this. Btw, he isnt 4-7. 😳🤷🏽‍♂️
@steakshapiro Listen.... I dont think everything he said was on point. But he made some good points. Massive respect for 2. Not looking for a change like some. But we can an must be critical. He is himself.
@N8Mozaik Ya'll would be mad at me running the ball 40 times lmaooooo
@APope45 I dont think he wants too 😬🤷🏽‍♂️
@UtesEquipment My favs. 🙌🏽
At some point in time I'm like alright we catching this L but I'ma run someone  over lol
@Isiah_Ryan I love 2. But he was hella shaky in several clutch situations tonight. It is what it is.
He was speaking truths all night. 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/bj3p2BCDqk
@COOKBEATS Something has to change.
@DeeBlowsTrees I would be out there fighting folks lol
@100ThingsUtah That part 🙃🙃🙃
@mfuery38 Man. I would have at least ran somebody over. Be physical!! Sheesh
4 fumbles in the red zone?!?!? WOW
A season with no sense of urgency.
@ChaseNCashe Lmaooooo. Stop it. Loyalty is Vintage.
https://t.co/RSpYFF5h3n
Two trips in the redzone 3 points.
KAZEE!!!
Whew.
@LoveThePuck Its not looking to good Miss. 😬
Anxiously pacing for tonight lol
Troy is shading the Boys' offense in a most polite way lol
What kind of route was that 19? 😬
@timwilliamsart @ThugLifeSocial Thank you so much for the tweet. And that would be super dope! I will keep an eye out for that. Much respect.
Long sleeve Zeke!
@ThugLifeSocial Happy Thanksgiving to you as well!
@LauraHarrisNBC5 Right. Ha! Love it
Chicago Bears celebrations on point! Ha
Not in a million years would Prince have cleared this song for this commercial
Bruh. What is this lol
Happy Thanksgiving good people. Peace &amp; blessings. 🙏🏽
@cedricemil My mood for tomorrow night 💯
"When I die I'm goin' out as a underdog who never lost hope"
@mannybowen43 We welcome you, Manny. More than excited to have you! Wishing you all the best &amp; looking forward to watching you shine! #GoUtes
@utahman21 Damn, good question. Haha. Well, my teams had a lot of success against the 🚫aints. We've continued to have success against the cougs. Still. It's a push. 😭😭😭
👀👀 https://t.co/VMC21BhYpk
@TheJazzyUte You think I'm missing the Utes FIRST Pac 12 Title game?!?! Nah. I'll be there.
@TheJazzyUte Bird was in the house. Automatic W. Ha!
It's a red out right? I would not be mad at all if these were the helmets again. Handle business Utes. Let's go!! https://t.co/6ELdMPzF18
Well done gents. Helluva footbal game from these squads! Rams stay on top with N.O.  #KCvsLAR
Joe Tessitore was praying for a Mahomes comeback. lol
That is how you do it. Goff steps up to get it done. Patient, percise. Strikes. I see you Rams. D on deck. This is a show folks. Enjoy
This is that drive. The Rams want to be seen as contenders? You've got to get it done here. At home. More the 2min to play. Let's see what they are all about.
SIX touchdowns. Mahomes is nice with it.
@greggrunberg Congrats brother! Looking forward to it.
Wow wow wow! This game
Always nice when a game lives up to the hype! We got a good one here folks. #KCvsLAR
@TBob53 @Mav3rick412 My G! 💯👊🏽
@yourhomiebrian Lmaooooo. If only it was that.
👀👀 https://t.co/20218vpX64
The Tim Green feature on 60 Minutes was something else. Keep fighting Tim. 🙏🏽  #TackleALS
@Jaleesa_Nicole Haha. Right. Whew!
@Lakers_310 First two you named most likely. Last couple games for Panthers have been rough
Quite the performance. 41 point difference.
Next up the Saints. They look decent this year. 😬
@919_falcoholic Good for you.
@Sequenc3ttv No doubt. But those are also excuses. The Eagles had them too last year.  They believe in their roster. They rely on the depth. They're here.
@bdd4life He certainly isn't the reason.  Never seen a quarterback comfortable getting hit though
@WonderJaye No I mean crazy. The injuries. Also,  who loses 4 games in one season on the last play of the game?! Crazy. It ain't over. But it's a def uphill.
@UBlender44 For sure. That's what I was saying. Shocked me.
What a crazy season for the Birds.
Penalties. Terrible finish versus a heated foe. What a way to lose this game to the Steelers.
@JamekaJo26 I don't think so. Maybe? But was moving around previous plays.
@justposa I expected him to as well. That was wild.
Oh my goodness Cam had forever. Had him. Missed. Hell could of run. Wow
Panthers touchdown. Riverboat going for two of course. Instead of tie
Well. That's all she wrote folks.
Got 11 minutes to save this.
Well. Give him some space he'll create the rest. Long sleeve Zeke stay grinding.
Alex Smith 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Let's go Ducks! 😤
NFL vs NBA, Game for Giving. Good times, better cause. Thanks @zeemullen, Savvy Affairs crew. Thanks to the players &amp; good people who came today. https://t.co/eCIDnS7zkF
Got it done. #GoUtes
Happy College Football Saturday. We break down the games today, plus the Birds vs The Boys'. On now  Fox 5. Special guest @Deacon_Schiele  joins us with a Falcon report. #PlayToWin
Big win for the Seahawks. Who also looked good in the L vs the Rams in LA.
That's it's his 1st this season. Crazy.
Tim Green 🙏🏽🙏🏽
@Curtis_B_Barton *Rasnick you mean. He was the OC. He got it eventually. Give Jamal the Ball. Indeed! 😎😁
@iDamienJackson Haaa. I actually debated that. But the production level is vastly different from 1 to 7. However, I am going to cherry pick crucial episodes from the beginning till now. 😌 Ha!
@malanjaye It's a lock. Def my child. ❤❤
Game of Thrones really hit us with the hype 5 months out. Sent me back to watch last season. 😁😤
@weimer19 @EricMetcalf21 Yes old friend! And ya'll (?) Browns got my birds its a good week. Haha.
@ATLANTAKENNEL They need to go back. Real hitters rocked with that. 💯🤷🏽‍♂️
@EricMetcalf21 I just wanted to hit people. I didnt get fresh till I played with you. Lmaooooo
Four. In a lineman mask. Ha! #GoUtes https://t.co/WechZ5UcS0
A mess.
Wow.
Chubb is eating. Whew.
Aye! Back to back! https://t.co/GrD7K9Zq9F

@bezy_bby 💯💯💯 Ha!
@ryanvlad22 All day. What did the five fingers say to the face? Slap 🖐🏽 Ha!
@UTEISH Fantastic. Me &amp; Utes us never part. 🙌🏽❤
@randycoggins 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I'd really appreciate no rain at these games tonight. 🙏🏽
@TheFalcoholic @admemorabilia I am DEAD lmao 💀💀💀
@admemorabilia Top 3. No doubt, DAVE @TheFalcoholic 😏😂
They should have hit me I would have been glad to to show the Grinch how to do my dance properly! Haha. Dont get my wrong I dig it. it's wild 20 years later we rocking. 🙌🏽
Wow. 😳 https://t.co/MEg2Et64bn #Grinch #Dirtybird
@TravDavidson @xXLINDEXx I agree. Want to see them do very well in his absence. Their time to shine. As for your other tweet about whether or not he returns..... 1 thing at a time. Get this handled 1st.
@SoJoBmanUtefan @PresMoss2 @Utah Indeed I have. Indeed he does. https://t.co/RBjYsY93VM
Be easy good people. ✌🏽 I gotta get these Moss emotions out. 😪🙏🏽
Bruce Irvin hitting all the right notes. HA!
@PisceanLuva @BFinn86 For real man. For REAL.
@BFinn86 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
They really like playing NFC South teams at home 😬😬
@gsalmeron85 With no evidence of his appearance. Doubtful.
Vroom vroom vroom.... The sound of the Steelers offense rolling down the field into the end zone. Again
@dailywinners15 It's cool. I still didnt really agree with the decision.
Interesting decision to sit James Conner for a quarter.
This game is crazy. And I like it! #CARvsPIT
James Conner in the zone.
🙏🏽🙏🏽
@UtesEquipment @Utah_Football Me 👀 at that Helmet ready to dance. Ha! OMG that helmet 😍 WINGS!!!! Dirty 🦅🦅 #GoUtes https://t.co/OoWFDYqnjJ
Bruce Irvin. Let's go!!!
Election day. Let's go!
@Deacon_Schiele Good stuff. Wishing you all the best. Also..... You should have definitely done the Dirty Bird. Ha! 💯 https://t.co/a0BpGEZYZD
@coates1 It's been so long since the cowboys were a real threat it's not even worth the hate.
They need to just move Jason Garrett to the front office since they like him so much.  They're just treading water
@ChrisSKreager No. The next game looms large. Tunnel vision. But I feel you, I feel you.
Missed half of the NO/LA game but be assured it will be watched in full. Have a quarter of Panthers/Bucs to finish also. Tough division. This NFC South.
I'm tired like I played today. Ha! NFL Sunday you did not disappoint.
Jake Matthews cleaned J. No's clock on that Julio TD. 😬
Great team win on the road against a division leader. Back to 500. Eyes up. Plenty of football to play. #DirtyBirds
@jowbb13 I was literally about the tweet about that. It looks awesome!
TOUCHDOWN JULIO!!!!!!!! Yes in screaming
Sanu has been doing a lot of good dirty work. Would've been nice to see him get that TD.
This is the penalty festival. Sheesh.
Really? 🤔 https://t.co/lDnA1d5LpF
My goodness Takk bull rushed him into the ground. Ha
They are crushing themselves with penalties
That is how you start a half. Bang.
Sanu is the mvp for that clear out. Ha!
There you go Rookie!! Bounce back!
Wow.
Offensive line &amp; wide receivers are out there staying on blocks. A beautiful thing.
THE JUDGE!
2 just saved Ito Smith life. Whew
Jullllllllllliiiiiiiioooooooooo!
@JeffSchultzATL I was hoping that early game trash talk was going to help. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Miscommunication on route. Let's go 18. Shake it off.
I like when these guys play mad and physical. More please. More.
Hoop got away with one  👀
Bye bye!! 26 got the wheels!
Yes sir 97. That's how you play.
My dude just handles business. Daniel Cormier.  Dominant. #UFC230

It will be a rematch for the championship for lil 32's team. Nice. Go Tank!
So disappointing.
Sheesh.
Come on defense.
He was clearly throwing the ball. But pac 12 refs. 😬
I really don't understand how you're not attacking, via the run with MOSS, a 3 man defensive line.
Let's go Shelley! Just make sure you feed Moss 🙄 Ha! But for real.... Do work, it's on you now! #GoUtes
Hate to see that with Tyler Huntley. Didnt look good. Hoping for the best. 🙏🏽

@TheFalcoholic @TheFrizz87 @BertEmanuel @therealtmathis @IsaacBruce80 Of course Dave you would glance over my numbers. Your Bias is showing. Again. Sheesh 🙄😑😂😂😂😂

A must win. Especially after the Saints &amp; Panthers performance yesterday. Have to keep pace. At the least.  Still in the fight.
Whew,, they like to make these things interesting. W tho.
Well done 26.
@kerrahferrah Lol. The Giants are not good. This is a struggle. Saints &amp; Panthers are clear leaders in this division for now.
Man. You have to have a certain attitude at home.
Passer*
DQ trying to keep them pumped up and rushing the passes. This.
So explosive. Dude turned the corner like a roller coaster lol. #Saquon

Oh man. Missed INT to a TD. That kind of season. Sheesh
Good lord. 🙏🏽 https://t.co/lMjkr4UBa1
Must win Sunday for the Birds!
They came to play.
The 2 pointer was blah. But Holyfield runs like his dad throws jabs. Vicious. Cade Mays cleared that out nicely. Those fellas are all about hitting. I like it.
@MeTheDevil414 Agreed. Glad they are clicking!
My dude Covey is like a Swiss Army Knife. #DoItAll #GoUtes
That was sweet! So happy for Demari! Tyler I 👀 you.
Well that was beautiful. Ha! Excellent finish. Nacua fought for that. And Moss, my goodness. Yes! #GoUtes

@jr48jj Thank you!
@MikeBellATL Who you telling. Me too. Ha. I will never forget, especially as we were in Miami, telling guys in the locker room pregame how Marino only made it one time. ONE TIME. Lay it on the line.
@MikeBellATL I was actually thinking this, 20 years ago.

I've been to an ATLU game &amp; of course Birds. The crowd for ATLU is lit. But they tend to be in their seats, lit. It's like the Birds game is kinda social hour. Its packed. But a lot of people are on the move. At all times. Sectionally lit. Just my thoughts.
@Adriansimmonds1 Preciate ya. And I feel you. 🙌🏽👊🏽😤
@smartfootball ☹😟😤😫
Its quite difficult to attend the games and tweet. lol. I also never sit. Never. Thanks to the Falcons for today. Nice to see a lot of the former players. Also, shouts to the folks rocking the 32 today. I saw you. Much love.

In the 25 years I've known and seen this man. He is ALWAYS in white shoes. This is being committed. Salute, Billy "White Shoes" Johnson. Also, thanks for giving a kid inspiration to celebrate after a TD. 💯
@JFields85 I don't necessarily disagree but I also don't think either one will be there.
@cbfett16 That part. For real.
@weddlesbeard Agreed from reports. Which as I personally know are not always accurate at times. But regardless. Guy was outstanding and a beacon to be around for Vikes fans. Hoping for the best 🙏🏽
@SignedSweetSpot Mercedes Dome. Duh. Haha. Kidding
Thinking about Everson Griffen. Dont know what's going on. But I'm wishing you all the best my dude. Zero judgment. Respect &amp; love. Get well. Get right. 🙏🏽🙏🏽

@MeansTim Likewise brother 🙌🏽
@LoveThePuck Right here Haha @RayBigplay training the future stars. Raising his own 🙌🏽
@UpsguyatlParker This wasn't my point. 🤷🏽‍♂️ But um. Yes.
It wasn't version you know. I was too hyped. Lol. Weeks later; I didn't believe in celebrating on the road. Played the 49ers at home. OJ had went off in New England weeks before. I was ready to go! I scored, saw the red light on the camera and this happened. TheOG 🙌🏽 #DirtyBird https://t.co/YkxIUAVnFC
We stomped the Giants. But I did NOT score. So I didnt get to celebrate what I was thinking about doing. Neither did OJ. Next week vs the 🚫 I broke free, busted outside and drove for the pylon.... TD! 1st Dirty Bird EVER right here. https://t.co/nalYQ2NqhY
Dirty Bird: History 101. lol.  We were in NY about the play the Giants on national TV.  Out at dinner with producer's of The NFL jam soundtrack. Ray Buchanan was on it. On the way back to the hotel. I was like, we need to do something to spark some attention cause we are ballin.
A lot of emotions watching this. If you've ever rooted for, cheered on, or simply watched Junior Seau play.... I encourage you to watch this. RIP Junior. 🙏🏽 https://t.co/qvjU0GlT8I

@JaynairDock There is plenty of football to play.  Still a lot of talent. Until they show me otherwise I will believe they can get things down

@BradfatherSpeak @utahathletics I am. Went in a few years ago. 🙌🏽 #GoUtes
@espn700bill It's looking like SC game &amp; the finale against you know who.  Ha!
Steven Means is a nice signing for the Birds. I feel like he will thrive with extended reps.
This remains true! https://t.co/NfuQj9q60A
@delmenendez @FOXSports Overall they are very good. I will say that delays of that nature tend to be wacky in general. And hey, Phins won! 👌🏽
@espn700bill Chris was all over the place. 100 years onto recover for the Bears. Sheesh.
Grand opening. Grand closing. Well done, NFL Sunday.
I will always enjoy watching the best players in this game make big plays on the biggest stages. #AaronRodgers
There's plenty of football to play.  But this one is gonna really hurt. Had chances. Will be interesting to see how this team reacts.
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Coverage? Rodgers would have hit Cohen in stride. Mitch should have let that go
Big fan of 24's game. Jordan Howard just keeps getting better.  🙌🏽
This is one of those drives. Week 1 on the road against an old foe. You want to prove your team can be a threat. An up and coming contender. Get it done here. We shall see Bears.
Aaron Rodgers makes a slight difference in production. Ha! Also, Nice job Jamaal.
The blowout dance? https://t.co/ck9vCEojMh
@LoveThePuck I'm saying. It just started. Breathe. Lmaooooo
@AJ_Lundgaard I cannot with you. No. Lmaooooo
Man, people have been so moist in these week one streets. Lol. Chill yo. There are 15 more. I promise.
@AJ_Lundgaard You will be borderline intolerable if the Vikings continue to play well lol
@Bolden7 I'm sure we'll continue to see mostly shotgun sets and quick throws.
@falcfans *tweets in my drafts* lolololol
Rodgers didn't lick them fingers for the camera. But for the ball. He's coming back in?!  Bless up.
@CharlieBHarper It's not like your intent changes. But the intensity. Different. There is nothing like opening up against a division rival
The Monsters of the Midway came to play.
Khalil Mack is decent. Lol
@Just_JoshG Literally nearly on life support when they hit 80 points. 💀💀💀
@Just_JoshG *tweets I wanted too but did not post today* 🙃😭
@ChrisSKreager Agreed. Its crazy
Wow. https://t.co/aUwIAbjZip
@AmyTrask Hi Amy!! Watched your show today. You were awesome. No surprise. Much personal affection for you. But forget that.... You bring the goods. With experience &amp; knowledge. Continued success. 🙌🏽
Been heated about this since it ended. A tie game. This shouldn't even be a possible outcome. It's like you didnt even play. #PITvsCLE
80 points. Still 5mins left. Did not see this. Nope.
@uteproud That is what I meant. You're an Anderson? You shouldn't have publicly tried to correct me. We family. I kid I kid. Lmao.
And that is why he was the first overall. Give him a gap. That burst. That finish. Just like that. Saquon is gone. Also his jump over an entire defender on that screen play. Explosive!
Mike Evans. Quite good.
Can hear a pin drop in there 💀💀💀
I repeat!! https://t.co/qoNVHUOAEd
James Conner came to seize his opportunity. Bravo.
😭😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/LorNdcYXFU
@UpsguyatlParker Haha! Nice.
When I saw the Giants first game I was wondering how Saquon Barkley would start. Rough so far. Jaguars are a very tough defense. Helps when your defensive line is starting every play on the other side of the line of scrimmage.
Kamara with a clutch block after the other big plays on that drive. Dude is so smooth, versatile. Instinctive. Feels like Faulk's game.
Is Brees doesn't escape that 1st down sack to open this drive this game might have really got ugly. Leads to a TD. No let up is right.
This. https://t.co/mKXRO64OZs
Fitzpatrick is dealing out there.
@Pogibry Good as in not majorly hurt. Banged up. Yes.
Welcome back, NFL Sunday!
"You play to win the game!"
@ArmyUte4 He was definitely twisting his ankle. Some straight BS.
@TOMMAAAAAY A lot of memories brother.
When Moss was on the turf I had to walk outside to catch my breathe. I'm like why are we even here. Noooooo   Glad he's good.
Expect David Johnson to have a monster season. Congrats on the new deal. #Baller
Most of Texas A&amp;M vs Clemson game I was thinking about those Cowboy hats the Tigers wore to town. Dodged that one. lol.
Thank you defense.
#GoUtes
Dawgs look strong.
Well. I guess everyone knows who Deandre Baker is now. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Kyler Murray is nice with it.
Georgia Tech &amp; South Florida are going at it. This game!
Oliver started stretching the ball out at the 4 yard line my dude did not want to run another play. lol.
Jonathan Taylor. Patience. Vision. Pad level. Explosive. Physical. All of the skills.
Houston looks good. Nice to have a terror like Ed Oliver on defense.
This game is crazy! Ha. Nice response Tech.
Wow. Um, maybe don't kick it to Terrence Horn anymore Tech.
@chrisswiderski I feel you, theoretically. But our Pac 12 schedule is brutal. Plus Cougs. I'd like to win division, play for a P12 title before I schedule aggressively out of conference.
@chrisswiderski I'm wondering how NIU's AD pulled this off. Why are we going there?  Regardless we need to be as physical as last week. Take it them.
We break down the Birds from Week 1. We will get you ready for the Dawgs vs Gamecocks, Stanford v SC. And, Go Utes!  All football, all show. join us this am on Fox 5 at 9am .#PlayToWin https://t.co/R3D5XFpH4s
@HoneysckleCharm It did look familiar 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/l9fRcSx8LZ
@JOEL9ONE Ya'll got a squad. Birds too. We may get another in the post season then it's on again! Haha. Have a great season 56! 👊🏽
@JOEL9ONE Massive respect for you as a person &amp; player. I ride for my squad, but happy for you brother. Tough game but got the W. You never quit on the field. And you're Good people. Much respect 💯
RIP Mac Miller 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Our connection came from our mutual love of football &amp; music. I was digging the sounds of this young artist. I reached out to wish him the best. He hit me back with respect for my careeer… https://t.co/QjmfYNmJcj
@HarryArnettCG 70/30 split. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@JustinFarmerWSB Yeah it would be nice to see a lot more of that. Gotta get Beasley going again. It was an ugly game. Penalites, redzone issues. Rough night  for 2. Still could have won.
Me: Avoiding all tweets and messages that the "Falcons are doomed after 1 game" https://t.co/ebqVTISGtq
@Keanu_Neal You may go through a range of emotions. You may question things. When this quiets you will work. Harder. You've proven this before. This isn't an opportunity to come back as good as you were, but better. Wishing you all the best 22. Awaiting you return! 🙏🏽
Goodness gracious.
@theNFLchick Wanna hear something funny?! I played against him in Juco. He was the QB at Glendale JC, who's uniforms are an exact replica of USC.
@theNFLchick Dont forget ALABAMA for a quick stink. Whew.
@falcfam Its was ugly. Rewatching. Play selection could be better in the redzone. Eagles had perfect defensive calls for a few of those plays. Additionally, It wasn't a good night for 2. He had a few big misses that will piss him off in film today. Still had a chance to win.
*mutes redzone*
@freakaleak1209 Wasn't all him my dude. Was not a stellar not for 2.
The redzone thing has become metal?  Blah blah blah blah blah. Log off. Block out the noise. BLOCK OUT THE NOISE. Just win the next damn play. One play to the next.
I feel like there were packages that used to be in the passing game for the running backs that have vanished. Those guys were mismatch nightmares 🤷🏽‍♂️
@JIngram071 Agree with all of this. No panic here. 15 games to play.
@K1ng0fHarts I feel you. But It's just not a regular offense you're prepared to run with extensively. This isnt the 95 Bills. But I feel you.
@TheMontyShow I dont have a proper answer for you. It's a bit mystifying how the numbers outside the 20's dont translate to success in the redzone. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@CookieBCrisp @UteYak *Saves both of your tweets* Tough guys lol. Ha!
@ShawnKalidas Lmaooooo. Well, he is. Shit. Dude slips and slides under all kinds of tackles. I remain impressed
The injury report will be like an episode of M*A*S*H.
Philadelphia remains a heartbreaking location for a victory. It wasn't pretty. But the Birds had a great opportunity to win. Again.
WOW.
@UteYak wait you're an Eagles fan? *reevaluates friendship* 😭😭😭
Welp.
Spoles is a slippery nightmare.
HIT THE HOLE. Finish. Nice Coleman. Great block by Mack.
DEBO!!!!!!!!!
SANU!!!!!! 🙃🙃🙃
Tru down. 🙃
Keeping it real. Nelson Agholor is like the example for being patient with talent. Its tough in this atmosphere now. Flashes early. Blah first season with expectations. But he kept working and put it together. Now a target/playmaker
Oh man. Challenge. Debate
Good stop D. Keanu again. Ugh
HELLO! Awful call. https://t.co/xCA7GOaErx
Pass blocking for a running back is critical to be complete back. I did not play until I could block somewhat like Ironhead. Notice I did not say the same. If nothing else go low, cut the LB. Can't get run over into the QB.
We good 🙏🏽😁
Bruh. If 2 is injured in any way from a slide I'm not watching football for the rest of the year. *Goes outside to SCREAM*
Great play for Duke to make.
Fletcher Cox is a monster.
Gotta score touchdowns. Especially on the road against the defending champs. Gotta score touchdowns.
So ready lol.  The people watching the game with me here at the crib think I'm crazy cause I'm continuously pacing and running up-and-down the room. I have yet to set down once since 8. Lolol https://t.co/0XjTn8LjSz
Must. Score. Redzone redzone redzone.
Good mix of formations and plays called. More importantly offensively they are attacking and prepared. Eagles are no joke. But moving the ball. Attacking
Said it earlier. Tevin Coleman has been putting up numbers on the Eagles.
We'll see what happens during the course of the game. But this defense has matured and continued to improve every year. Quinn knew what he was doing going for it on 4th down. Belief on both ends. Birds score, great. If not my D is ready to attack an O backed up inside the 5.
Interesting Julio was not on the field the last two plays? I know 4th was a run. But the threat of options.
I'm not mad at this. I am not.
Move the chains. Zero rust from 11!
The Philadelphia weather is conspiring to slow down the Birds y'all not fooling me. 🙄😭😭

DIRTY BIRDS Let's go!!! #PlayToWin https://t.co/Epqo760HhJ
@nwilborn19 @GeorgeFoster72 Hell yes it is. Remember I held out after our Super Bowl run to get paid my worth. Man if Whitfield, Tobeck or any of my lineman came with this stuff cause I would've been furious.
@GeorgeFoster72 I've seen nothing but quotes from his linemen. But agreed.
THIS. Especially my Lineman. Sheesh https://t.co/AYZoKcZD50
@DubMentality @SportCardCollec Rookie card. Nice!!! 👌🏽🙌🏽
They grow, but the LOVE &amp; Hugs never change. Immensely proud of who you are jamthetank32. Future so bright. ❤ https://t.co/EOxhlPOWjK
@PresMoss2 I gotchu hahahaha! 🙌🏽 https://t.co/0cGIiQh8wW
@UteFan_TJ @PresMoss2 Correct. 😭😭 https://t.co/wppnp3Fwum
@PresMoss2 Last game of the season you gotta hit that Dirty Bird when you score and just take the penalty. I'll be standing there if/when Whitt goes off so he can chew me out cause I told you to do it. Also, I'll pay the fine. Haha! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
@Dlatham2500 Exactly ME! Haaaaaaa
I will be in all of Kaepernick's new Nike gear the day it drops. With a big grin. 💯
@arielufret Agreed. It was soooooo clean.
@WIvery_2 Bruh who you telling. I got my ass whipped in the coldest most beautiful uniform I ever wore in college 😭😭😭😭
A shame. They were clean. But there is a good chance FSU put these uniforms in the nearest graveyard. Hokies came to bring the pain.
@GunFaceP @uaeute @UtesEquipment keeps me so fresh. That white jacket is 🔥🔥🔥
Being on the West Coast damn near a month my timezones are completely destroyed.

Preseason polls, blah. It will never change and we've got to debate something 🤷🏽‍♂️  Nothing like week one exposing the frauds. You best show up, or you will be shown out. Whew!
Welp 🙃😭 https://t.co/9fKr8BooxP
@MikeGarafolo The ones you never think. Late round picks and free agents can sometimes change the franchise. Show up, show out. Very happy for him.
@RamsNFL @EricDickerson I was fortunate my father was a friend of Eric. Watched him on the sidelines. Eric took this kid under his wing, allowed me to hang at his house. Touch his trophies. His impact on my career is immeasureable. Forever grateful. 🙏🏽 Happy Birthday ED. Great player, better person!
We continued our relationship for several years. Yes, we battle on the field. But he was such a good man. I mourn his lost. I hold Coach Edwards in as high esteem as I do Coach Mac. It's not about the numbers. But about the men. Respect.
Thinking....One of my greatest football memories was winning in Provo. Soon after Coach Edwards was selected as Coach of my West Shrine team. An amazing person. And he believed in me. Which made me excel. We had a great time that week as I got to know him. RIP Coach Edwards 🙏🏽
@Roberto_Garza63 Oh my goodness did I just see your big pretty self in a Modelo commercial? And I thought Tony was the model!? Hahaha. todo lo mejor mi hermano orgulloso de ti, éxito continuo
@BrightFame34 Its was first game sloppy but fun. Clearly two talented teams who will have good seasons
Ok Cougars. Ok. I know some of you are hard, hard core. But keeping it 💯my heart won't allow me to root against Kalani. Unless of course its against my UTES. So, happy for him.
@TheFalcoholic I hope every message contains a note saying.... "Jamal is in fact one of the top 3 Falcon backs ever" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Welcome back college football!
@JetMckinnon1 Keep you head up! You can be faster &amp; stronger now. Excited to see an even better version of you next year, Jet. Wishing you all the best! 🙏🏽
Washington blew that game.
Texas fought back. But Terps got it done! Utes top 25 baby! Ha!
@TheJazzyUte This is me also. They literally have THEIR OWN NETWORK 🙃
Sending 10 offensive players out for the first play was one tribute to Jordan McNair. Putting a whipping on Texas game 1 (if this continues) is the other.
@byjoelanderson Facts! Ha
@JimTrotter_NFL I think it's hilarious that a coach who was gone for 10 years but got a 100 million dollars didn't want to pay a generational talent who proved he was worth a 100 million dollars 🤷🏽‍♂️
Khalil Mack, Leornard Flyod &amp; Akiem Hicks. Not a bad trio, Bears.
Watched the Utes a few times now. About what I expected sans the start.  Covey doesn't appear to have lost a step. Ha! Moss looks faster. Yay! Snoop, it's your time, get it.
Utah State good job, good effort.
@SeanWSpoon56 Magic Johnson did. Ha!
"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving, And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may, Just as hate knows love's the cure, You can rest your mind assure.... That I'll be loving you always" 🙏🏽❤

#TheShopHBO was dope!
@EvolsOf_Lucy I don't believe in Jinx shit, I believe in ballers. We good.  They told me if didn't dance we would win. We went to Super Bowl, dancing lol
@BobbyGarrett13 Always and forever. Bobby Christian (with my O-Line)  was the most important part of my shine. ❤💯
@RVA_Ute I think our uniform options now are pretty good. Appreciate sentiment. They sort of did an updated version two seasons ago(?) It was awesome. Happy to see these pics of me &amp; my old roommate, Luther Eillis. A stud. #GoUtes
Congrats, OBJ!

@espn700bill @ESPN700 I was at LES in 93' when Chris Yergensen kicked his legendary 55 yard fg to beat byu. Greatest performance.  #legend haha! #GoUtes
@UteZone @BrownbearSLC Thanks for sharing this. Respect. All the best to you.
I believe in preseason snaps. Gotta get ready, live snaps, right? But man, i cringe when someone goes down. Idk. It's just not worth it to play starters in the preseason. I'm shaking my head as I type this.
*Wasn't* fat fingers touch screens
@putemupcdukes @AtlantaFalcons Put zero stock in the preseason. ZERO.
@ShenaMo22 @JOEL9ONE Although I am not a fan of the short suit. I can be convinced of these numbers if he wears a Fur collar in said short suite, and timberlands post game. HA!
I'm in LA. Well. Now I'm in "The Valley" of San Fernando County. But over the hill. Drake lyrics explain all this lol.  I want expecting this. Lmaooooo 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/EboIOZCzFY

@DubMentality @pdxGRAPHIN You're welcome!
That dark studio turned into a 40 yard turf field in a beautiful complex as EA Sports grew. This is also why my #DirtyBird dance was so accurate. 💯 (And No I'm not on Madden Ultimate.... Yet 🤷🏽‍♂️😢)
Enjoyed watching people play with Barry Sanders and comment how awesome his spin move was knowing it was me who did said spin. Or Marshall Faulk's jump cuts. Madden said it "Versatility" ha! I did motion capture a few times. It was an awesome experience.
H/T Rare_Sports. I think I was the first person to do motion capture for EA Sports Madden game. RIP Mary Snow 🙏🏽. First time was in a little dark studio in San Francisco in 95'. I did all the moves for every running back in the NFL o that game including touchdown celebrations. https://t.co/8d9iS0NHPn

Is that Seahawks great Chris Warren's son (CWIII) who balled out for the Raiders today?
@dunny445 This is what I'm hoping
Some of these penalties that they're calling are atrocious. It's about to be a long season. Make it stop.

@CherisHodges Believe. My happy ass was dancing all over Houston. We make it in ATL I'm losing my mind 😭😭
Super Bowl in Atlanta. Goals. 🙌🏽
@yourhomiebrian That part. 💯

I'll be happy to meet anybody who wants to further disagree on the field at noon tomorrow. I'll bring pads for you. We'll be friends again after I smash you. https://t.co/oDTYnNvYlG
We'll never agree about player salaries. I will stop replying. Please stop sending me messages. I cannot stand how some act like it's coming out of their pocket. Your attitude switches on guys (on your team) who want their worth. Its SUPER CORNY. I LIVED IT. Goodnight
@Randawg21 @PatrickT30 @NEZUofU Many thanks. 🙌🏽
@aClarkKentType @UKnowFredHoe @TheFalcoholic Yeah because there is a more important player than Julio. Lmaooooo
Here come the capologist. Sheesh.
@UKnowFredHoe @TheFalcoholic How much is either of his contracts costing YOU? And are you monitoring Mr Blanks profits with the same enthusiasm? I'll wait....
@zanebeadles @Pac12Network @Utah_Football I remember this part quite well lol.
@TheFalcoholic Good luck with that 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️

@SteveArzberger Has to be. I'm mystified it hasn't happened. Top 3 player in this league. An absolute monster
Aaron Donald has to be so heated. New players. New money. But the franchise? 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
@BryanRasDesigns LIES!!!
@pedersen_darryl The guaranteed money is what counts the most. 10 million? That's it. Please.

Only thing that saved this day for me was Barry Sanders highlights. Bless you 20. 🙏🏽
No wonder he can't get paid. Veon Bell is trending. I'm like who the hell is that?! Goodness gracious 😫😤
@DixieSportsman @steelers That wasn't nice of me. My bad. So. Let me further reply. I understand what you're saying. There have been issues. But he's exhibited behavior to the contrary, recently. Plus to me, his numbers,  overshadow those. Especially recently.
@DixieSportsman @steelers Did you miss the argue with yourselfs part of this tweet? We wont agree. Peace &amp; blessings 🙏🏽
@CommodoreKEV Ruthless. But quality tweet non the less. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
8000 yards of offense in 5 years? Argue with yourselfs. It is preposterous he can't get secure a long term deal. https://t.co/YSmFr1O1Pq
Le'Veon Bell has 312 catches in *five* seasons. I know what his position title is. But he is MORE than a running back. Should be paid as such. PERIOD.
@hannahFlippen can we talk about how badass you are? Proud of you. Continue to shine Hannah. #GoUtes
Indeed. https://t.co/ONePBGVlfB
Tick tock, LeVeon Bell deal on the clock.
@docshaw This is me. Also. But I'm not hopeful. 🤷🏽‍♂️

@craigstreeet Man listen. Haha!
@mshackleford I understand what you're saying that Matt. But 11 is a once in a generation player. Hope it gets resolved soon.
@itscongomudface Ruthless.. A lot of very good players tho
@jd251 Yes he did. And yes teams dont honor their side of contracts all the time.  Look how many sad departures of veterans we see every off season who've been at their respective team for years. It's a business then. Right? It's a business NOW. Got it. Good.
@Coach_Holloway Bruh he's the number 1 WR being paid like the 8th. Again brainwashed by the narrative. Unless you are Arthur blank's child the money does not affect you whatsoever.
@DanWolken I understand that position. I also feel like I could confidently say (and pin this tweet) that Julio is going to be a monster for at least another 4/5 seasons. They know it. Thus negating this position
@jd251 LACK OF PRODUCTION? stop it. Over 1400 yards last season. He is A1 WR in this league. Always wants to win. always ready to dominate.  He will land in the top NFL's 100 top 5 players this season 🤷🏽‍♂️
@DanWolken No corners. Top 5 player in NFL. Top WR. Not even in top 8 pay. He has multiple examples that show him this is a business. He is treating it as such.
That dude is a monster. He shows up EVERY game ready to dominate. His physical presence and ability changes the offense.
If you fixed your face, or Twitter fingers, to slander Julio you are super wack. You have also been brainwashed by the narrative. I'm not against the Birds in any way shape or form. I want them to win it all! But I will advocate for top players to be paid so until they bury me!
@MikeTanier The enormously loud sound of silence. *Crickets*
What a time to be alive.
@jeannathomas You got this. Ha!
@kawikasmith2 If the shoe fits. Ha! But for real I've been on the Le'Veon needs to get paid band. This like my 5th instrument.  😭😭
@itsjoeyj Maybe? They stay trying to find reasons to keep the money lol. Given his overall production tho
@ZachBlendGV Zach. He's about to land in the top 5 (?) of the NFL's top 100 from last season. I get the TD thing. But dude is A1
@LoggyBoo Pure comedy. Dude could miss all of training camp will still be a monster next season lol
Best player on your team. Best player at his position. Should be comparably paid as such 🤷🏽‍♂️
@Heezy_PackyYow @devontafreeman My dude is full go every snap. I love it. 100 miles and runnin'
@mattkaroly Yeah. 2 is critical. But maybe 11 is both? May explain some of the offseason.
@onlyonejj22 45 bout to be lit this year! Haha. Cant wait.
Who is the best player on the Birds? Who would you say is the 'heartbeat' of the team? I was asked these questions on a radio show. What say you?

@justposa Quarterbacks too. Believe that.
Kyler Murray sounded pretty convinced he was going to play football for OU. But being selected 9? Man. Listen. Whew! What a talent. Outside of game hits, a QB's football life is not very physical. ??

Jordan Mailata is a very interesting prospect who lands in a great place. Size &amp; athleticism. 👀
Darren Carrington II should be highly motivated with a major chip.
OH. Someone just text me saying his Dad was *Lavar* St Brown  😭☠🙃😑
Skills. Crazy combine numbers. Fantastic size &amp; speed. Plus the best name in the draft.  Surprised Equanimeous St. Brown lasted that long.
Kylie Fitts is coming to do work! Good one Bears. Congrats my man. #GoUtes
@dirtybirdstock I love Free. But Coleman finished the season like a monster. Plus, zero concussion history. Idk. But. Factors to consider.
Seeing tweets about Coleman, his 1 yr left on his deal. I Don't see him going anywhere. 🤷🏽‍♂️
@FalconFanDarryl Hate to compare. But. Ward more Freeman-ish. Ito more in the mold of Sproles.
Congrats, Shaquem Griffin! Keep proving then wrong.
@swe_carter I ain't never scared. Hahahahah
Dude just tweets out all kinds of speculation. Stop. Please.
Ito Smith. Super-shifty. Maybe the most sudden jump cut skills out of all these RB's. Plus wheels. Wheels!!
Don't want that energy. *Shakes it off*

He's a problem in the run game. Quick too. https://t.co/Ctw1slwAGp

@TheJazzyUte Of course I was kidding. All good.
@vxmcclure23 Blah blah blah. 2nd WR taken, right? Sometimes the board is the board. Just show up. Work hard. Be a good teammate. Don't drop sh*t. Wishing him all the best

@FalconFanDarryl Frankly there are several players I feel like the falcons could have gotten here. Bryan, Hernandez, Hughes, Landry, Ridley. Non of which would have made me mad. Ridley is nice.
@JustinFarmerWSB He is a very talented all around WR. Plus Julio, Sanu, etc.
Glory! Forgive delay. I ran outta the room celebrating. HA! Welcome Calvin Ridley.

Bruh. Please don't let the Saints draft Lamar Jackson. 🙃🙃🙃🙃
Vita Vea has been a problem. Didn't see him at 12. But he's a stud. Bucs: Vea, McCoy, Tuck &amp; Curry.
Also.... 🗣🗣 HE'S GOT LARRY FITZGERALD  No better pro to mentor Rosen.
What a great spot for Josh Rosen. Great organization, fans for him. They will be patient (sort of, ha), he stays on the West Coast, it's chill.
By the way. Chubb and Von Miller on opposite ends. Nightmare. 😭☠
Roquan Smith should be a beast. Great instincts. Smart player. Skills. Urlacher mold.

@mcooperisonit The greatest con in the game. Fuss about the employees while a billionaire laughs away in the back. The money does not come out of your pocket.
@I_am_J9911 That part. Sheesh
I used to get so mad after losses some of the vets had to talk to me about calming me down. Let me know everyone takes losses different. They're pros.   Me: Got it. Ok. But let's win.
When I was drafted by the Birds there were so many people in that building collecting a check. Period. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to be a part of a cultural change. Until I got to Atlanta, I'd NEVER had a losing season. I started playing when I was 7.
Seeing all the stuff with Dex reminds me of what I went through with the Birds. Super wack. Will never forget. But hey, it's a business.
Its hilarious to me how invested fans are in the owners take in football. Like the money is coming out of YOUR pocket.  You folks are constantly talking about player salaries like capologist but never about the owners $$$$

October 31, 2017.  "The Dolphins traded Ajayi because they believe that his most productive games are behind him, fearing that knee issues stemming from a significant 2011 surgery are finally catching up to him"   Jay Ajayi looks just fine heading to the Super Bowl.
Eagles have played determined,  resilient, together, all season. Big night.  See if they have one more in them.

@BumpJ_effrey Bruh he got worse injury luck than me 🙃🙃🙃🙃
@Bill_Murphy313 LMAO.
How did they let Alshon Jeffrey get out of Chicago?
Goodnight.
No catch. Good job, good effort tho
@run__lmc I mean. I was hopeful. But....
Goals. https://t.co/kNndnbWFy4
Nick Foles is having a monster game.
Smith makes up for earlier in a big way!
I know Matt Ryan misses a Gonzalez/Ertz like target. What a difference they can make.
Ertz shook Harrison Smith like he didnt  grade out 97% all year. 😏
Wow.
Bulldozer Blount.
Ertz been making these played all year.
Big time return from Robinson.
Tempo. Formations. Play selection. Execution. Touchdown.
Now that is an opening drive. #Vikings
@GeorgeFoster72 I don't disagree. I also know the ramifications when it bounce back in a major game. Feel me. Play on playa. Talk yo shit.
Here lies the bad part of talking so much shit pregame. Against Tom Brady &amp; the Patriots, of all teams. Welp.
Kind of fitting that Dion Lewis put this thing to bed 😣
Look at that. A guy jumping up and diving to make a play. It's on the line. Championship.
They put James Harrison in the freezer like a Gremlin and just unleashed him in the AFC Championship.
Fournette you have to dive for that. It's on the line.
Great camera shot on Brady's eyes.
Oh my goodness this is the call of the year!
Penalties lead to a touchdown. Crucial.
@Brooks_the_Lab Indeed!
@SFGiantUte All facts.
Sacksonville.
That part. https://t.co/OzQDAeHTCL
Bortles is dealing!
@TruBronco Not at all.
Great play action. Bortles with the floater.  Marcedes Lewis deserved a score that 1st touchdown in the AFC Championship.
Jags ain't shook.
There is nothing so great as a receiver who blocks down the field.
3 &amp; out.
That Defense came alive in the red zone.
Cooks doesn't have to slow down to make that catch he might still be in the tunnel.
Hahaha. Please let this game start. https://t.co/mXCT9uB977
@The_Spight_King How correct you were. Killer performance from Spence. Domination.
Young bull came to work. Who's next? Erroll Spence.
Tough conversations to have. Treat him like the champion he is. But respect the champs life.
Peterson is a G. But this. The sustained drubbing from Spence. Only a matter of time. #SpencePeterson
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #SpencePeterson
Bruh. Spence activity level is on point. Blow after blow. Stays firing. #SpencePeterson
I like how you knew I was watching this fight! Haha. Spence Jr. Respect Peterson, thinking the young bull. Let's have a good fight! 🥊🥊 #SpencePeterson https://t.co/txCmjUMPfD

@TOLYATHAT That part. They stay trying to find ways not to pay this man. Like he don't give 1000% every time he's on the field.
Vs Jags. 16 carried 67 yards. 9 catches 88 yards. 155 yrds total offense, 2 TD's. 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/aoZGuw8DSZ
@Bighugh53 Haaaaaaa. You know you my dog.
@Bighugh53 LMAO. Get em' Falcon fans. Hahaha. Kidding. But this is comedy.
@weddlesbeard @bsgillis Always &amp; forever 32. 💯💯💯
@bsgillis @weddlesbeard None the less, as always, you are a gracious Ute for the invite. We all we got. #GoUtes
@bsgillis @weddlesbeard If i may. You cannot make bringing Alex Smith a condition of getting free ice cream. Eric deserves this on his own merit. Haha. But facts.
They said we had no chance. They also didn't pay attention all year. The OG's in this celebration game. Ha! #DirtyBirds. https://t.co/yrDfPT0aZf

@NFLOwnerGBP Salty as hell lol. But it wasn't about that game. Ha
You should not be allowed to have a nickname unless you show a minimum 2 years of outstanding production. Y'all give somebody a nickname after 2 games then they vanish. lol
@TJthaKing Man I hear you !!!
@MidwestATLFALC I don't know about that Jordan. Defense it def better.  I expected a drop off in offense. But I also expected more consistency.
@LauraHarrisWFTS 😣😣😣😣😣😣
@MikeTrillMadeIt Also how they failed to utilize him in the passing game like last year.  Big fan of 24. But 26 was on it
@AlvinGermaine Don't mind Ward normally. But you've got to get it to your big time playmakers when it's on the line. Period.
@nickthegreekrj At least give him a shot.
@CWave_Dave Very frustrating. That kind of year for the  offense.
James White deserves that touchdown on sheer effort alone
@ATLANTAKENNEL Ridiculous man.
Eagles aren't the number one seed on accident. They've been getting it done all year. But Birds had a great chance do win.
Man. Listen. https://t.co/naZvJWgiEG
I would have found some ways to get the ball to 26. Explosive. he was ready to go
Brutal final play. What was that.
Wow.
That's a catch.
@WarrenSapp Like 24 a lot, but 26 been on it tonight. They'll look back and wonder why they didn't use him more.
Julllllliiiiiooooooooo!
Schrader wiffed bad. Don't really blame Coleman for that.  Soon as he looked up 55 was in his face
Leave 26 in the game!!!
Giving up that field goal before the end of first half. 😣
Very similar play as the 1st quarter
Foles was dealing last drive.
Much better job of stopping the run so far.
Good push upfront. Needed that.
Again. 26. Let him cook.
@theseangray No clue. None at all.
SMH
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME?!?!?
He definitely touched that ball.
Penalty!?!? Yes!!
Cutting back across the field. Danger Will Robinson.
26 *came to play.
Coleman has been ballin' all game. 26 games to play!
Be great to get some points here. Birds open the second half with the ball as well. Attack attack attack.
Foles. Welp.
Wow! Great play 2. Nice bounce back.
Oh man
Hit two Eagles
Got one. Must capitalize!
Bean Talk.
Review. No touchdown
Slick play.
They need to figure out how to get this guy contained. Immediately #Ajayi.
You gotta catch that Nick. Would have moved the chains. And Schweitzer on Cox. Welp.
Takk! Man he's gonna be nasty
Brutal penalty
Moving the chains. Nice mix on offense. Great to get the ground gains early.  Good start. Need a good finish.
Birds got it!
Started broadcasting college games on ABC. Had a chance to learn &amp; listen from the best in the box with Keith Jackson and Fouts. The game was #1 USC vs #7 Cal in 2004, featuring Rogers and Leinert. Great game. Keith Jackson was the best #RIP

Baby Jesus what did we do? I will Dirty Bird from here (ATL) to Selma if you get this curse off of us? 😢😭😢😭
Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
THAT HAPPENED. WOW.
After a huge sack. The look off he gave the safety. Then the dagger to the heart down the left sideline. Wow. True freshman. Starting the the 3rd Qtr of the National Championship after riding the pine most of the year. Talent on talent on that roster. Tua. Baller.
WOW. Tua Tagovailoa delivers #NationalChampionship
Blankenship. Clark Kent in this bihhhhh.
Tua Tagovailoa. To come in at halftime and do what he has done in this situation, very impressive. Unfazed.
OVERTIME. What a game. I feel you Dawgs fans. Too close for comfort.
Tua. Dishing. Wow.
Yes, Herschel still looks like he can carry the ball 15 times tonight.
Naw. Don't think they'll give him full possession.
That was a strike! And an interception
That's how you show you want the Natty. It's going be tough. But this is how you finish a foe
Doh!
I know Chubb &amp; Michel are the engine on offense. But Fromm's composure and presence since he's taken over was the missing key to elevate this team to this game. Ballers everywhere else on that roster. Huge throw
Oh boy. Tua came to play.
New QB. Same issues. Dawgs on the attacks. Good start to the half for defense.
*Already purchased a row at Imax for Black Panther*  #NoNewFriends Ha!
The perfection of Kendrick performing while 45 is there. TDE!!!
Great play call! Quick snap too. TD Dawgs.
Huge penalty.
Fromm delivering.
Get point Dawgs. A TD would be great. But at least get 3.
Zoom zoom. #1
Welp.
Fromm on 3rd down thou. Major
The battle in the trenches is too much fun tonight.
Improvisation.
Oh man. Down the middle of the field, late under pressure. Whew.
@Lizzs_Lockeroom I was like WHAT?! Live TV. Been there. Ha
Wims got it. Body control on 1000
Look at the kid. Been making plays all year. #Fromm
Did he call him Eason?!
Michel 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Payne is a bad man.
3 running plays in a row. Chains moved!
Dawgs D came to play.
Dawgs need to line up and give it 2 plays and go straight em. On the ground. Give those backs a chance.
@DanBama420 Right. Crazy talent.
Bama safeties might be best in the Nation.
These games. Every. Point. Counts.  I remember saying on the cast during the Rose Bowl how big it could be that the Dawgs got 3 before the half. Missed FG. Every. Point. Counts.
Georgia has some ballers on defense, too. Haha! But facts.
Kirby knows Hurts just as well as the rest of the current Alabama coaches.  But you can't account for improvisation
That Alabama defense has some ballers
I low key preferred not to get the ball first.
That thing is awful.  I'll take the crystal ball any day  🚮🚮🚮🚮 https://t.co/MprLeavfCj
The worst. Ugh.
Ready for this one. Physical football. Yes! Let's go!!! #NationalChampionship
@ChrisSKreager Ayyyyeeee..... all facts!
Good football game. Tough to beat a team 3 times in same year. Panthers battled. Saints vs Vikings should be live.
@jelynchjr Bird bowl. Haha. Let's do it.
Cam Jordan has been outstanding all season.
Lamar Jackson just finished watching that game like not a chance I'm considering a position move.
Romo got carried away with that. https://t.co/aIfpGBPyUS
@MikeTanier Right. LMAO!
Guy next to him. The shirt with a White Bronco on it "The juice is loose" 😭😂😂 https://t.co/zJkGo8cPyS
@BGann89 I didn't mention him because I mention him in his own tweet every single game  With your exact sentiments.  I wholeheartedly agree
Might've been Alford's best game? Several things to be pleased about with defense. Young hitters. Only gonna get better. Whew
@ZachBlendGV Major. Ogletree had him he ran right thru that. Big pick up on 3rd &amp; 9. Rams defensive line is no joke. Aaron Donald was an absolute nightmare all game. Perfect group to run a screen on
Birds respond next drive with 5 of 8 plays being passes. Rams clearly geared up to stop the run. Ryan doing MVP stuff on these. Extending play hitting Hooper on 3rd &amp; 3. Sidearm screen to Sanu. Back foot sliding floater TD to Julio.
9pt game. Top of the 4th. After Birds give up 3&amp;15. Gurley had 2 big runs to get Rams in the red zone then he's out of the game rest of drive. Weird decision if he isn't hurt. They end up with 3.
Birds drive to open the 2nd half was a thing of brute beauty. O-line battled.   Freeman &amp; Coleman running hard dropping shoulders. Quick snap on 4th &amp; 1 w/QB sneak. Ended with a FG, but 2 to 3 plays inside 10 were pass plays on a run heavy drive. 13 plays. Clock killer.
Good night, good people. Peace &amp; Blessings. ✌🏽
@FalcFanCoulborn Fuck. Ok. Who CARES. LMAO
Double digit win on the road in the playoffs. Playoffs. *Herm Voice*
A lot things you can point to for the plus &amp; negative. But Birds advancing. Period. It's about W's. However you get them.
@Pwilds121 I don't know how you really disagree. the rams were out a sink tonight, no question about it on offense.
W #DIRTYBIRDS
Maybe. Just maybe, playoff experience matters a little. 🤔🤔
Alford has been on it all game
Debo stays making plays
Bang Bang! Defense holds. Again
No touchdown
Oh man. Smart move by Rams to run another play. That was highly questionable
🚨🚨 Red zone touchdown 🚨🚨
Finally!!! JULIOOOOOOOOOOO
SANUUUUUUUUUUU!
Move the chains. Kill the clock. Move the chains. Kill the clock.
Man. Listen. https://t.co/qV6Kqa1b84
Still. Birds Defense holding the highest scoring offense in the NFL to 13 points so far.
Cause they couldn't stop a 3rd and 15?!?! Sheesh.
Money Matt. 💸💸💸💸
Big stop for defense. Again. Birds need another clock killing drive again.
That's how you run 24.
Man they are lighting number 2 up
Awful. Can't give up a TD here
Field is TRASH
Goodness gracious that was ugly
Gotta keep this 3.....  Never mind that
Only a matter of time with Gurley.
Had to have it. Well done 51
Wow. Gotta take advantage of these! Need a TD
Rams defense on the attack. No time. No pocket. Owning the LOS
Big start for Birds defense.
Primetime. Playoffs. Gotta love it. Gotta bring it.
Well. Well. Well. Titans roll on. Blew it KC.
The first game I ever suited up for as a Falcon was in LA, at the Coliseum. Been along time since a playoff game was hosted there. Going to be fun tomorrow.

@MeTheDevil414 For me, it always matters when you take the field. Though, I confess I'm not enthused by all the Bowls either.  I'm putting pads on I'm going to work
So far, Utah the only Pac 12 team to win it Bowl game. I am happy and in tears at the same time.
The Belk Bowl tho. Lit.
@Nic_Wright17 💯💯
The PAC is catching L's in these bowl games.

@tfowk_100 Seriously who knows what a catch is anymore. Thought it was a TD. Feet in the end zone.
Win and your in. That's been the name of the game and nothing changes next week.
Julio in the end zone but not a touchdown. Wild one.
Bruh. Manti Te'o was out there looking like Ray Lewis.

Can't convert.
Damn. He said he sees a 👻👻👻👻👻
OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!
Julio never gets calls
Wow.
DEBO!!!!!!!
Payton uses Kamara like he used Bush.
If Todd Gurley doesn't get some MVP love I will lead the revolt. Monster season.
Many mistakes. Penalties. Missed opportunities. Down 13. Not much
Ginn Jr still world class speed. Crazy.
Petty on 💯 https://t.co/QO8lSlRrup
This was the complaint of many Saints fans last game.  I have never believed once in my entire playing career that the refs were aiding the other team. It is what it is. But it sucks. https://t.co/fOUHP3RnkR
EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. https://t.co/zc36MTu2eZ
Must convert 3rd downs. Must convert 3rd downs. MUST CONVERT
Defense handling business
They've got some slick plays for Kamara. Lots of movement.
Big big call here. This is a playoff game folks. Intensity on 1000.
More Beasley plays. Gotta play on their LOS to stop those two.
Steady dose of 22 &amp; 41. Buckle up. Bring it.
I like me some runnin' Matty Ice.
Missed opportunity on that 3rd down. Had to hit 11 out of the break. But Lattimore is the truth.
That looked painful on 26.
Ryan &amp; Brees are the leaders. But I'm excited to see this running back battle today. #Falcons vs #Saints Its On! #PlaytoWin https://t.co/5Nl4MuK4Aq

Birds 4-2 in last 6. Collision course. T-minus 12 hours and counting....
@danim0 Aight thats cool.
That is the plan. Should be a good one. https://t.co/6OuftyJFGW
@RossMartinATL Yeah. That part.
@BloggingDirty I feel you. I do. And I also understand Quinn.  Creating an atmosphere is important.
Y'all are hot about this.
Welp. https://t.co/sJGmGvuzMV
Having to coach fans on cheering 🙃
@Bighugh53 Been saying this all day. I never hoped to hurt anyone. But I played with violent intentions.
This. https://t.co/NhaKaoK9uL
@gmfb @Nate13Burleson @KyleBrandt @PSchrags Finished the segment rocking the Dirty Bird. Classic. I see you getting them right Nate. Nice job Kyle. Peter, Welp. Haha. Respect. 👊🏽
Crucial. https://t.co/1UCEt2gF3l
@JetMckinnon1 You learned it honestly. We good 👊🏽 keep balling!
Vikings are tough. That Defense is serious.
@Dbpolo_93 lol no doubt!
TAKK!!!!!! SACK!!!!
@BLee2real Right. 😣🙃🙃🙃
BRUH! He did that Dirty Bird like he got lessons. Ha! He is from the A.... I can't even hate. Welp.
@YourHoodLawyer Ayeeeee. They cut one of my parts. But coming back. Haha
Dawgs handle business. Congrats!
75 million. Guaranteed. Big business.
Ha! https://t.co/XAdpzIWM9t
Light's, camera, action. On Dynasty tonight. 9pm. CW. 👀 https://t.co/EnfKLQcS8h
@COSam2 All facts. 💯 I see you @GregBell_. Wishing you the best whatever you end up..... But #GoUtes Ha!
@AKRoosa I stand corrected. You're right. 😂
@jamiehwood All facts. Haaaaa
@MelNoGibson That part. Sans the wheels to evade drama. 😂😂
I never understood folks wearing jewelry on the field. Prime did it... But he ran a 4.2
Crucial. https://t.co/fpZPbydfxV
@CALiboy4 I see you putting in work! Skills all day. Keep shinning! #GoUtes
Was about to tweet how good of a pick up Sanu has been. Playmaker, great teammate, energy on 💯, good with fans. Shouts to #BeanTalk https://t.co/R3GG6HyMqs
@Stick2Sportz It's really almost a crime at this point. Clearly it's business. BIG business. Free labor baby FTW!
@BloggingDirty Quite proud. This is coming.... lol 😂😂 https://t.co/86zY0mbBjX
Julio is something else. And my dude has his celebrations ready to go. Bravo.
Goodness gracious. https://t.co/07xYAoCAsp
That part. https://t.co/NBgHf9Jc8E
Big win for the Rams.
Kamara is a problem.
Wow https://t.co/Tov6ir3Fz8
@TheEightFour That part. Needed. Big ones coming.
W!
Dude has wheels. Now Coleman has a touchdown ball for each twin. Nice! Congrats
Bruh how do the Bucs not have three defenders on Julio?! lol
@ATLANTAKENNEL Dude is next level. Baller!!
@LeeCwilson @TheFalcoholic That did look familiar. Haha
Nice mix on the play calling on offense in 1sy half. Helluva play by Sanu. Obviously Julio is WR A1. Monster.  Hopefully Keanu doesn't take anyone else out on the Birds.   So far so good.  Finish!
Please win in these throwbacks.... 🙌🏽
Happy for the seniors, Troy, great finish. One more to go.  Zach Moss, what a game!! 👏🏽👏🏽 That's how you run the rock. Welcome to the Utes 1k club! Finally, I dig the helmets.  #GoUtes
"All these 90's fantasies on my mind The difference is that with mine, they all came true in due time.... But I Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself" You don't have to prove sh*t to no one, except yourself... And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help"
https://t.co/myEJpKUbB4
That moment when I told Tevin Coleman I was as fast as him. Robert Alford &amp; Taylor Gabriel were like, WHAT?! Takk didn't have time for it. 😂😂😂 #iKid // Good guys, wishing them all the best. #Falcons #DirtyBirds https://t.co/qlQMcHF4UA
Must have victory. Got it done.
Touchdown!!!! #DirtyBirds
Surprising no one who really watches football. It's a four quarter battle in Seattle.
Keanu Neal hit Graham like he said something about his Momma. 🤤🤣😂
TAKK!!!!
26 is NOT 24. He has his advantages, but being physical runner is not one. He don't really want nothing to do with running between them tackles.
If you're as good as Freeman you never have to bring in the *third* running back.
Fast tempo. Big energy. Big stage. Yup, you can tell they both need this one. Game on.
Dodged one before Sanu TD. But you gotta catch that ball, Hall. You have to be ready for the quick throw on a quick slant screen.
Saaaaaannnnnnuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!
Juuuuuulllllliiiiioooooooo!!!
Trrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
Last week I got to hang out with a bunch of Falcon fans. Here are of the few pics. Good times.… https://t.co/PuGXJkvVzJ

@MattWPDE @GeorgiaDome Likewise good sir. Dance on! 👊🏽
🙏🏽🙏🏽 https://t.co/xGyVEUy8oB
@franny911 A little of both. I remember the bumps in the road in 2015.
Must win Monday night for the Birds.  Top of the conference is no joke.
@bomani_jones The original colors were supposedly to represent the "peach state". With a less-than-favorable lease agreement, inconsistent success, we were primary residence in name only. That changed with Blank. And a player commitee. But you can thank him.
@TKells Preciate ya!
Down it goes. Goodbye, Georgia Dome. 😢
@AKRoosa Yessir. DA best. Ha
@jusher35 💯💯💯💯
@thisisjims The BEST PART of the video....  Vs Niners. Hahaha 😂😂😂

@gumby61184 Oh no, not at all. Yes we were playing the Cowboys but it wasn't like they wanted me to get hurt. In fact moose came to check on me so did Emmitt Smith. Then Smith followed up to wish me well with one of the most beautiful letters I've ever gotten.

@ChelsIsRight LMAO
Peace and blessings good people. Especially on days like this. Another tragedy. Another church. More innocent people senselessly gunned down. 🙏🏽
Few backs have been better than 24 finding (or creating with a cut) the lane between the tackles. Outstanding. #BeastMode
Beast Mode.
@47brownies That part. Sort of. Haaaaaa. No but for real.
@GeorgeFoster72 He got to be catching a suspension. He wasn't even playing?!?!? Starting a fight without a helmet on too. WHAT?!
@MikeTanier Ruthless ☠☠☠☠
Fights breaking out all over NFL fields today. Fines, probably a few suspensions tomorrow. I got a $5,000 fine for preseason altercation that wasn't major. I was immediately cured from from all future tussles on the field
@Osubarry He is not alone. every week we see cornerbacks making "business decisons" instead of tackling.
Lord Romo just ethered Peters.
@The_Spight_King Not soon enough. Sounds like Joshua's people are going to delay it.... we will see
This can't be life.
@cedricemil I could *almost* understand that if it was  Marshawn Lynch or Fournette. But 22? Nah
Come on Alford that was a terrible effort
@keefnit100 This was a very physical from the start that the Panthers physically took over. Birds being pushed around. Not good. Not good. NOT good.
Good grief. Disaster.
Oh my.
@EvangelicalNorm Evangelical Norm....  there hasn't been a more appropriate reply to a tweet. Carry on good sir  haha
Peace &amp; Blessings good people ✌🏽
Good night good people. I was going to stay up and spend the rest of my night rooting against BYU. But I've grown. 😏😣😑🙃😭😂😂😂
@Temro11 @ConnorHeyward1 You surprised? That's Ironhead's son. 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
@JoshHarris25 For real tho. He's the catalyst to changing the fortunes for the Irish. The truth, he is.
@jemelehill Fun to watch him roll. Dude moves like he's 170 lb, so explosive. But I tell you what JH, Bryce Love is pretty damn good too.
Bedlam. Indeed. Wow
College football, you don't disappoint. Unless of course your squad caught an L. Crazy games today!
@UteimusMaximus Facts. 👌🏽😂😂😂
@Dan_Saldivar Agree. I  am a big fan of VIOLENT RUNNING. Haha.
Watched the game this am. That was fun! Great to see offense take off.

https://t.co/SdE2wUI5QF
I've got to go into this event. No opportunity to stream game. Welp.  #GoUtes
Let's go!! BELIEVE
@BandGandD Yeah it's weird I'm so used to us being able to move people. Scheme also.
Man..... The uniforms and helmets are so hard they got to win. I'm in here really chanting "I believe that we will win" 😭😂😩😁
Urban, legend.  #PSUvsOSU
Stumbles. It's unfortunate. Moving the ball. Making plays. Obviously need TD's. When Huntley puts it together. Talent.
Carrington has crazy ability.
Those Georgia running backs. Nasty. So, so nasty.
*#×+
@JenksUte "Some of y'all" doesn't imply all. No comment on the Pistons lol. #GoUtes
@MarkCHealey No sir I will not be there. The AFC East hasn't been kind to the birds hopefully that changes

@johncessna Been this way. Folks get mad when players used to say there's a plantation mindset. Now you see why.
Gotta love those "supportive" owners.  😑🙃
@danrafaelespn @anthonyfjoshua @SHOsports @BronzeBomber The fight we REALLY want.
@kylekuzma let me get that jersey homie?!? Ha. The brothers gave me the message. Respect 👊🏽. Keep ballin'!
@sorny11 Figured as much. Ha
Lakers ball. Game
Ute fans. The conflict. Kuz a Laker. And balling. I know some of y'all are in therapy cause you love the Jazz, too. Haha.

Yes!!! Note for new folks or the slower crowd ( love to all tho) I moved to LA when I was 8. Mom, and all but 1 sibling still in LA. So you know who I want to win. #WorldSeries
Back to back. ✌🏽
Long day. Peace and blessings good people ✌🏽

👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 https://t.co/smAzJy5GeE
Great play 11!
You know what the film session is like on defense when you get shook by Carson Wentz. 😂😂😂
@BR_DougFarrar All gone! It's crazy. Complete mismatches. I feel like Coleman is missing an entire package from last year.
@BR_DougFarrar Watching game right now. While I agree,  Ryan should/does have some input right? especially with his experience/credentials. I prefer this. Or  let's do this. Also they're certainly not doing the dynamic things they were with the running backs last year
@okbroncos I'm not even mad at their aggressiveness. They're moving the ball and scoring points. So....
@XfactorATL Yeah, and not just that. they're not nearly doing the dynamic things with the running backs they were in the offense last year. Coleman especially.
@WestSideDiddy Its certainly some on scheme,  but it's not all on him.
@JermaineKing Whew. An interesting set of downs. No doubt.
@tyewing2 Brutal 😠😭😕
@DOrlandoAJC It's crazy. Julio doesn't get calls.
Julio like....... FINALLY!?!
Wow.
Bruh the Patriots bought all the fog machines in New England 💀💀💀
This. Move the chains. Just move the chains. Rhythm comes from movement.
Not doing defense any favors. Focus on first downs. Just move the chains.
That was my favorite route to run out of the backfield. White was excellent.
We can't get a flag? Hahah. How is that incidental contact??? NBC stop.
Oh man. What?!?!?!?! No way they're prepared to throw anything for Brady
Btw, Cassius Marsh father is Curtis Marsh. Arrived with me at Utah. C.Marsh was nasty. Made a bunch of big plays. #GoUtes
Physical battle, I love it.
Patriots *lead the league* in offensive pass interference.
Nice job defense.
@TheRock @benpobjie LMAO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
https://t.co/W4vrZmGIA0
@brokenFalcon66 @kristenm2185 Bucs lost. But bo doubt, need a win.
Panthers lose in Chicago, Saints win in Lambeau, Buccaneers in a dogfight in Orchard Park. This division. 😬
Rams are 5-2. McVay has the Offense clicking. Gurley ballin', Goff is night &amp; day from last year. Defense flying around.
Barkley put on a show! 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽 https://t.co/cnfGS8HWSv
Utes. Block out the noise. Get back to the physical grind. Be upset, be angry.... But also be determined to put in the work to turn it around. Together.
Awful.
@jr48jj Great game. Tough one for Alex. But what a game.

👀 26. No training camp. No problem. $$$ https://t.co/mScEMafGyG
@kylekuzma You helped put it there KK. The benefit of your excellence prior to the extra perks is your work made it possible. The next Utes get the shine brighter because your Utes did. We are bridges for growth.
@DixieUte I actually had something planned. But if I use your name do you want a producer credit or nah? Haha 👊🏽 #GoUtes
Peace and blessings good people. ✌🏽
Game over. Not only is he stupid big, Derrick Henry got wheels. Sheesh
@jhadfield36 A designed backside screen that's covered kind of kills what. If you're referring to the last play? Other than that your penny-pinching. he had a great game on the road vs Sam Darnold
@SoJoBmanUtefan Patience* good lord. Haha
@SoJoBmanUtefan Precisely. Good patients, good Vision  great pad level..... Running with the termination, it was fantastic!!
@1steamUte Better and better! Sincerely, a fantastic place to go to school and play football. Notice my order. We graduate our players. 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Last point on that game. I was very happy to see Troy Williams perform the way he did. He laid it on the line till the end. I can ask for no more.
I've watched the game 4 times. Despite not having all the "ballyhooed" recruits, we should have won. It was a difficult loss, as was Stanford. But Utes can play with anybody. Nobody wants to win more than Whitt. We're good. Gonna be fine. #GoUtes
I broke down my 3 favorite plays from Zack Moss Saturday vs SC. Big game at a perfect time. On my Instagram stories: @jamthedirtybird #Utes
Frank Gore is that guy that you see everyday that shows up to work in his hard hat prepared. He doesn't say much, but he gives you great examples of hard work, daily. Does it all.
@devontafreeman Probably be a good idea to give you, um....more than 9 carries. Also remember that Jones guy. # 11.  He's decent. Find ways to get him the ball too. Playmakers need the rock. Period
Adrian Peterson is here to remind you  he can still tote the rock.
@DaDiscoNinja I don't know man. But that was ugly. To lackadaisical. Didn't attack.
@iAmAnt__ @bezy_bby That was a great play by the cornerback to put his hand in there.
Utes up 14 at the half. Birds up 17 at the half. Both lose.  Me rn: "Here I come Elizabeth" https://t.co/6BnPrHxBOl
Tremendously disappointing performance in the 2nd half. Back to Back L's at the crib.
Dolphins making plays on offense. Yup. Ajayi doing work. Yup. But the lack of sustained drives by the Birds offense hasn't helped defense either this half. Need it now.
Ugly.
Jarrett should've pulled up. That was Ryan you guys would be losing your mind. Terrible penalty. Now a TD. Fellas better get it together. Dolphins came out the locker room ready. We got a ballgame.
Clock killing long scoring drive. Ouch
Quick dive. Coleman with great pad level, extension. Timmons is no slouch.
That's it. With a fast defense like the Dolphins, they've tried to continue to stretch the pitch. You've got to hit a lane and go. Freeman was perfect there.
Can't keep giving up these chunks on the ground. 23 is a problem.
That was a sweet play. 2 launched that thing up to the rafters.
@utahckh No doubt the Utes came to play, and came to play hard. Credit USC for doing what they did but I like the way we looked
@harperhsv I had zero problems with going for it. It's about winning.
@traumaqueen327 He was running with bad intentions. I like it!
Hard one to lose last night. Woke up shaking my head. Uggggggh.
Yes, run game makes a big difference. Moss doing work. 👏🏽👏🏽
@jtorg Agreed. Better Mix. More intensity. Shook off those two trips inside the red zone that produced zero points. Great
Troy Williams came to play tonight. 🙌🏽 Good mix on offense. Keep rolling. #GoUtes
Welp.
Defense!! #GoUtes
Tough one to drop for Tech.
@BradfatherSpeak @nikkydwilliams Thanks so much! Hey @nikkydwilliams, Tech looks decent today. 😁

@tfowk_100 I feel you. But what makes him more special is he's got way more than just arm strength. That dive for that touchdown tonight! you know what type of ability you have to possess to pull that off. Off. Charts.
@ryneblaising Not long enough. Like to think I would have made an impact. I'm a nerd. I wanted to know what everybody's job was and how it worked. I love Vick this was not the shade him
@ColeWrightNFL Hahaha. Never that. Isn't eerily similar? My thing is when you are supremely physically talented will you do the additional work to round out your game?
@BiggWoodz13 Ouch. That would be brutal
Cam is like big a** Mike Vick. On one play he's incredible, a series later, incorrigible. Will he be able to sustain consistent dominance? Or you're going to have the same ups and downs with your emotions every week. "Oh he's amazing..... Oh no what the hell Cam?"
#PettyBird
Just breaking down football. Breathe Falcons fans. Non analyst Jamal is happy as hell the Panthers lost. 😭😂😂😂😂
@UteGibby13 Still had space to do exactly what they wanted for route that's going underneath on 4th &amp; 1. It was there all day. Cam missed it.
They let him out hot. As they should always. 22 did his job. https://t.co/zk6TapywGK
I know he had 10 catches tonight.  56 yards. Meh. Weird to have a talent like McCaffrey and see him picking up blitzes, checking down  to get out of the backfield
😭😭
@mikemcintosh7 Yeah that was brutal. It's like they're trying to get the hell out of there lol
Kind of surprised it wasn't a penalty on that TD. Dickson was not trying to get open. lol.
Also. The Eagles are definitely winning the celebration game this year. 💯
Nelson Agholor is back in USC mode.

@TaylorRooks If he has a go to running play what is it? Has he ever thought what his career would be like without Parcells?
@exavierpope I agree. I know it's not necessarily a popular sentiment but I want a team there. I'm all about the game going global. Mexico too.
Adrian Peterson has to be first NFL player to play 2 games in London in one month? Cards there 10/22, Saints played there 10/1 #UKAllDay
@AndrewSiciliano @AroundTheNFL He missed most of 2016 with injuries. Obviously New Orleans wasn't the fit. You think he doesn't have it anymore?
@DamonSantore Thank you good sir.
@BloggingDirty Its a date 😍 Haha. Mant thanks. Will let you know. I appreciate the invite.
Kyle Kuzma out here ballin' and I'm loving it. Keep it up KK. #GoUtes
@Takk Do work Takk. We're here for you. Love your candor, enthusiasm &amp; passion. Crush QB's. 👊🏽
Ditka has always been about Ditka. This is the same guy who didn't think about Walter Payton during the Super Bowl. He been cancelled.
@Lizzs_Lockeroom I own the OG table top version. it is fantastic
@MasterTes This dude just needs to go to go away..
The Cubs fan last night geared up as the Ultimate Warrior is my new favorite person.
@jscloward Unless you were in the services? I guarantee I've been to more countries &amp; visited more military bases/ personnel than you have or ever will
@schilzy12 Hate? Weird. But because the Injustice isn't happening to people that look like them. For a moment (kneeling), reflect &amp; wish for equality
Peace and blessings in people.
@HockeyBeard Goodness i'm hoping this is the one
@ChadFred Guess what Chad.... There is NO rule that says we have to stand. Next?
@ChadFred Chad do you stand every morning at work for national anthem? I'll Oh by the way, an  anthem which originally the third verse disparaged you?
@JoshHarris25 I so hope this happens. But.....
Good people, I know you are out there, despite what Twitter presents at times. WAKE UP.  We are Americans, too. We matter. We want Justice.
I wish Jerry Jones was my owner and tried to impose that ridiculous statement on me. GTFOH. Consider this Bird gone. Totally missing point.
@UGottaLovItBaby I honestly wish they all would. But its never going to happen
I would be 1000% be on a KNEE every week if I was playing. NEVER to slight the soldiers. About bringing attention to what's happening. NOW
I bet you I've spent more time than 95% of the NFL players in actual camps with soldiers. Been to Iraq, Turkey, Germany, England bases.
I'm like you, I would LOVE to just talk about the games. But you can't just Target the NFL, the justifiable protest, without reciprocity
I'm not about to sit here and let this happen. I don't know about you, or your life, but for me it is unacceptable. Naw. Nope. Not happening
These cats are really staging things around respectful protest in the NFL. A thousand times. It's not about the flag, the song or soldiers.
@JeremyMMerrick Gracias senor 😃
I have the upmost respect for the presidency. I would NEVER normally retweet a President w/a comment. Different days &amp; different times.
@DevRickus The Anthem was never about US, read the third stanza man. Frankly it's amazing we've acquiesced this long.
I log off of Twitter a lot because of dumb sh*t. I'm not about to tolerate dumb shit and dumb conversations. This is real. OPEN YOUR EYES.
If you like me, by the way people who look like me are being gunned down for unnecessary reasons. GET REAL
Damn this game. if you have a problem w/players taking a knee for social injustice &amp; police brutality you are awful. This is ridiculous.
Still kind of so crazy that this is real life. 45. Awful. https://t.co/56jmlJuV7d
@awfulannouncing Going to go out on a limb and say, Sean McDonough doesn't know shit about Star Wars.
@UtahPigBus This is me. 3-2?  I mean if I wanted to watch hockey I would have just waited at night. Lmao
Btw, the game went to the side, I've watched the Star Wars trailer "The Last Jedi" an unhealthy amount of times. #NerdyBird
@mikefreemanNFL Me when we opened up Titan Stadium &amp; Jevon Kearse was chasing me on a sweep. I was like who is this &amp; how is he keeping pace with me. 😂😂😂
Been watching the game on the Duece, Fútbol Americano de la NFL. Completamente entretenido esto puede ser mi nueva rutina.
@Lakers @kylekuzma #GoUtes !!!!!
@SendMeVickPics @89SteveSmith Haaaaaaa. FACTS. I'd take 14 million to kick it any day, year, week or month. 😂😂😂

Perfect handle. @ImFasterThanYa 😂😂😂😂
Stomped that hope right back out of Houston. Chiefs are rolling.
They were doing the ACL test on JJ Watt. Unfortunately I know it too well. I'm not saying that's what it is, but I know what that drill
Helluva football game.
This is what the best do.
Aaron Rodgers folks. Oh boy.
Would normally say never do that. But when Zeke found that opening and stuck the ball out he saved them. Packers stuffed them.
Marshawn Lynch gave C.J. Mosley the business. Yes Lawd!
@TonyDasco Anything but. Frankly, a helluva performance after last week's debacle.
@jr48jj Thanks much. Appreciate you watching!
@rodimusprime @shadowandact 2nds this. One of my favorite follows.
@DSorensen I need that on a t-shirt. Y...  "Sweet merciful crap"
@Lizzs_Lockeroom Really nice of the VP to attend said game and try to upstage his whole day with a planned exit. Sheesh
I cringed seeing OBJ going down. Just awful. 🙏🏽
This is great. Ha! Monster day for Fournette. He is bringing it. https://t.co/fXQmGV8OAC
@tfowk_100 Weapons man. Dickson, Benjamin, Funchess also balling. Add Stewart &amp; McCaffrey.
@YuriyATL404 Basically. Man. 😣
Cam is in 2015 form. Ballin'
Sweet option play by Panthers. Nice use of McCaffrey underneath with Stewart main option for Cam. Slick.

✌🏽 peace and blessings good people
@whatupbob Got us. Hahaha. Congrats on the victory. Yes, Yes, Bryce did his thing.
@The_Spight_King @BlockU BRO. EXACTLY MY POINT.
@BlockU Its not numbers. We don't have any consistent Rhythm running the ball. I'm not opposed to running back by committee, but we need a Booker
Now it's SC, in LA. Where oh by the way, they destroyed Stanford. Utes come physical, like they're quite capable of doing, I'm good.
@johnnyas Yes, why I said, more how we operate in the offense. It should have certainly remained an emphasis. if nothing else to keep Love off field
Tonight would have been an excellent opportunity for #3 on this stage. More reminders of inconsistent past season. Tough one.
What is Kannell talking about. He had zero reason drop his head like that after that pass. he knew exactly what he was doing
@johnnyas I'm not being critical of the guys, more how we operate in the offense. We were known for big dominant backs for years. Miss those days
😣🙃😲😭
Knew it was going to be more than a battle but dang Bryce love he is something else. What a weapon.
I remember when we had a running game.
@SpokenVessel @BloggingDirty Many thanks Marcel!
Stanford's Austin Hall (RT) #75, is son of former Cougar/Falcon Travis Hall. He's family to us. He wears 75 to honor Shane Dronett (RIP)

Tony Romo is definitely in the booth 20 minutes after the game, calming down.

Never been a red of home red. Even though it is the OG home colors from 66'. Orignal as a homage to UGA. Thing is, we didn't get our own identity until we went BLACK.

@MikeSorenson1 @AtlantaFalcons @Utah_Football @UteFootballCamp @NFL @autographblog You're welcome. Glad you like them!
It's early but one of these teams looks ready to play and one of them looks asleep.
Expecting Zeke to be highly motivated and inspired to roll.
@TheUFanCast Very happy for Alex. Great guy. Great Ute. He just might have the team this year to take it all the way
@UteBeliever Indeed. Top 20. Expected as much. But I don't like to gloat (yeah right!?) HA! #GoUtes
Kareem Hunt, Todd Gurley, Freeman, Jordan Howard, Chris Thompson, Dalvin Cook, Carlos Hyde, Henry,  Fournette, Mixon coming. RB's ballin💪🏽
@MyniqueSmith I wish I could take credit, someone sent it to me. I'm like, Oh.... He's doing the Dirty Bird. Perfect. Ha

"God forgive me for my brash delivery, but I remember vividly what these streets did to me"
@DonnyVantage Yeah I don't see any issues, he really doesn't take big hits. His height, pad level make him very hard to see coming. + he explodes thru
Mixon is a difference maker.
@TheFalcoholic You are sooooo dramatic. Lol. Insanely lucky? 30 points in Detroit vs that squad with three turnovers. D made plays, on field all day.
@theNFLchick My petty is on 1000 today. Lmao!
Knew this was going to be a battle. Lions are coming together nicely. 3 turnovers on the road and still win. Whew.
SIKE. https://t.co/6U61ON0XbJ
WHAT!?!?!?!?! WIN!!!!!!
Enjoying the penalty fest 😲🙃
Defense gets it done again.
18 💨💨💨💨💨💨
@paytonsun He's entirely too talented to not sit down and let that shoulder get healthy.
EAT FREE
@Tonypjssays Yeah. Attack attack.
@fsutoby Agreed. Nasty
Good finish for defense.
Quin was waiting for that. Stared it down from the snap.
Interesting. Haven't Ameer Abdullah since Keanu Neal dropped him like dead weight. Not saying he's hurt, but that hit certainly did
Few people hit that lane harder than Devonta Freeman. Pad level, explosive. Every time he touches it. Angry. Aggressive. Love it.
Deion Jones just keeps getting better.
@falcfans I mean I'm running all the stretch plays to the left. Traps. Draws right.
Schraeder's value &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Shakes LB outside,  then breaks in skinny knowing he'll get hit if throw comes. Thats the spot, 2 on point. 24 is money. #EatFree https://t.co/Vf1cqlLocn
Even if it isn't a TD. The Lions came out hype on D, at home. Birds methodically marched right down the field.
This is quite the opening drive. Looked like a touchdown to me.
@DevinD33 @fuegote Easy to say when it doesn't directly affect people that look like you. Game is still played. You could tolerate a minute for injustice, no?
The real Ravens must've got locked in the badement of a Madame Tussaud's.  😣
@ReignOfApril @ScottyLiterati @JoyAnnReid Everyone stood when the anthem was played.  My bad for not making that clear.
@ScottyLiterati @ReignOfApril @JoyAnnReid That's not true. The national anthem was played before every contest. I entered the NFL in 94'
@UteBeliever I like the youngsters we just got to make sure we hit what's available and not look for big plays. Lanes man. Hit them.
@TonyDasco Deano is completely useless
These Arizona games are all kind of similar. 4-0. Most important. Hopefully our injuries aren't too severe.   #GoUtes ✌🏽
The broadcast crew is less than desirable.
The refs are awful.
Run into the whole kid, the blocking was set for you to hit that lane. Trust it. Stop bouncing outside unnecessarily.
93. Beast.
Thank goodness. #HandsofStone 😂😂

@BFinn86 That was a good fight. I mean. We didn't know what to expect if anything at all?  Conor trained. Floyd didnt back down. We Got hits. Win.
I'll see my way out. Ha! Good night good people. ✌🏽
Yo! For real tho you knew it was a wrap when Floyd came to the ring looking like Ser Ilyn Payne.  #ThronesYall https://t.co/6OJBAw5ZRh
Bigger physical guy McGregor. #Mayweather didn't back up. And finished him w/KO. You can hate the extra sh*t, but as a boxer, flawless. #50
Floyd was chillin those first couple rounds. With advantage McGregor should have used weight. lean on him. Push on him.   Money  50-0. Wow.
OVER!! Again. Mayweather didn't back up one time. Conor worked hard. But it was just a matter of time. Tick tock. Tick tock. #Mayweather
Tick tock. Tick tock. Just a matter before Mayweather started smashing that face #MayweatherVsMcGregor
@RBallis For sure. I'm impressed
@utahutes24 I will post information next week prior to my arrival.
@flyfishingtime *doesn't defend*
It would appear that Floyd doesn't want anybody to say he was running or backing up from McGregor. He is not at all. Taking shots tho
I'd be leaning on Floyd and pressing him more if I had the weight advantage, apparent fight adv McGregor has right now.
Floyd hasn't backed up once. Hits or no hits. He keeps coming. Interesting.
McGregor is definitely 170. Looks so much bigger than Floyd. His counter-punching looks good. Still. Mayweather coming. Tick tock tick tock
Main event. About time...... Let's go!!!! #MayweatherVsMcGregor
@Schumacherf2015 Don't worry. Not pissed at all. Haha. It's all good
Always fun to come back to the Lake, my other home. Especially to support Utes for THIS game. Look forward to seeing Ute fans. Much love

I'm not tripping that I'm not on the list. I helped put the program on the map. I'm good. #GoUtes
A pretty solid list. There are a few guys I could think of who deserve to be on there. I was looking at it like 🤔 - is this right order?
Full disclosure. I was a voter to select the 12 best Utes for that Pac12 Net show. It's my first time seeing the final 12.
@APurposefulUte You're going to make me cry 😢 Haha. Many thanks.
@JustinOnslowNFL Taught it to my 6 year old running backs. Like, you literally can't carry the ball for me if you cradle it on the wrong arm. Drives me crazy
🤔 https://t.co/hSTSHsUeno
@BiggWoodz13 Brah I actually played. I KNOW. And I'm not Trippin. Clearly
Well, that was..... blah. For the first (preseason) game in the new house. Oh well. Didn't count. No major injuries. Keep it moving.
@corey_erdman congratulations on the nuptials Corey. All the best to you and your bride.
@JustinTinsley A must. While playing "I ain't mad atcha" 🙏🏽
@BR_DougFarrar I don't know. But he needs to stop carrying the ball with his inside arm immediately
@robr0013 All day. 💯
Colorado State is giving Oregon State the business. Welp.   Beavers Ryan Nall making the most of this light. He came to play.

@CornellWBrooks @theNFLchick @CNN You do realize he is supporting Kaepernick, right?
Haha. I love this thing. https://t.co/JcjxOU2pDt
@sgw94 Right?! Um.... He could have easily said I hope the organization gets something done for him because we need him. Yeah, that part.

@rex1616 Don't worry Joseph, I shall never be so distracted.
@DonnyVantage This is Twitter I'm being slightly more dramatic lol. But dammit. The #1 show in The world. Come on. Don't take shorts on us now
@AltNickRad Right.  For the length of time Ed Sheeran was on screen we had to dude run a marathon in the snow &amp; a dragon fly across their world.. lmao
@Versuhtyle BINGO. This this this. I mean really we couldn't get three more episodes?!?! 😩
@MJeezy2017 I had no expectation that a TV show could do what the books did. I rode with, kind of got most of  changes. But man. Now?! Chopping it up
We needed a new book George. But none of us needed the book more than Weiss &amp; Benioff. This season is a mess.  #GameOfThrones
The timing of this #MayweatherMcGregor 🥊 fight with the climate of the country. Whew.
@WertmanAngela Thanks for this! 👌🏽
No, I didn't know that was going to play out like that. As surprised as some of you. But hey, best man. You have to come to compete. #GoUtes

Love that 24 got in the endzone at the crib. Then out. Ha! #EatFree
And of course I'm tracking the RB's. Ward is tough. Hard not to root for him. Really like Brian Hill size and skill set. Wanted to see him.
I spend most of my time in these preseason games basically praying that nobody gets hurt. I don't even like to think it. But. 🙏🏽
Terrible to see Raekwon McMillian lost for the season. Sheesh. Come back strong bruh.

@Biso_Fly I say again. You should be concerned with what they generate not what they make you don't pay them. Check the teams earnings the same.
@Biso_Fly All sports have caps. This how they trained y'all fans. To be concerned with what we make instead of what we generate. Not out y'all pocket
@knoxbardeen That fans ever worry what a player makes is ridiculous. Not coming out yo pocket. They worry about the money teams make? Congrats 24. Earned
Congrats 24!
So sad. Rest easy, Reggie Lewis. #BaltimoreBoys

Goodnight good people. Peace &amp; Blessings. School back tomorrow for my crew, up early. Love my kids. But a glorious week for parents 😂😂
@shanek72 That's going to be interesting. Notice how Bran was rather normal around Littlefinger? Is going to be interesting
@kerrahferrah Tell me why I should watch it, if you would please Kerrah?
@JaYSiiN I've never seen a full episode
Bran, Sansa &amp; Arya at Winterfell near the Weirwood tree talking. It's the little things I tell you. And Years. lol.. #GameOfThrones
@weszeitz Exceptional episode. No doubt. Once I finish my 5th run through I could tell you where it stands. Haha. But I'm serious.
Jaime Lannister's gold one hand having ass stays surviving a catastrophe or war. The most fortunate mofo to ever lay his head in Westeros
@tfowk_100 Yeah I can't really fuck with it. And I love the Rock. Idk. give it another chance and a few months. Or is it too much like my life? Lmao
Speaking of. Rest In peace, Darren Daulton. 55. He Battled. Damn, took my Dad around the same age. Prayers up his family. #FuckCancer
Y'all watch Ballers?
@ramonashelburne We really deserve at least a conclusion to this. Haha
Arya and Brienne deserved their own episode. 😩

@GeorgeFoster72 OMG you went to marathon strides and you was trying like a mofu..... But. Um.... 😂😂😂
@RAIDERS @ProFootballHOF One of my favorite Raiders. A shame he's not in the Hall. Don't forget the unforgettable 21 from the Raaaaaiders. *Al Davis Voice*
Collins had a solid finish last season. This year, already very competitive group. 10 games, going to get left behind.
@AJ_Lundgaard Quite aware. 🤐
@Lizzs_Lockeroom So dope!!!! What a finish

Blank had a glimmer in his eyes when he mentioned what he was going to build in Atlanta. Knew that moment it was going to be incredible
So, Mercedes Benz Dome is stupid incredible. Which reminds me. I was walking into AT&amp;T (Jerry's world) before Super Bowl w/Arthur Blank....
@Lizzs_Lockeroom Stop. You rock. Consistently bringing the heat. Don't stop. Do you!
Doesn't matter where I find them. Some of my best followers are people I found that way. That goes for people that interact with me a lot.
If you send a good tweet, I will check your timeline. Whether I agree/disagree with what you're saying. I may follow based on those tweets
Of course MJ is going to ride with Drake. Drizzy sells sneakers for him. MJ IS Brand Jordan first.

@thegifgoat @BiggWoodz13 Correct!!
@theseangray Squads is there. Should be no talk of anything like this
Was hopeful, but not surprised Freeman doesnt have new deal. Once Bell didn't sign, thus setting market, knew it was going to be long shot
