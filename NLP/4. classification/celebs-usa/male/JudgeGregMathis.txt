Thank you guys for tweeting with me! Tune in to the Judge Mathis show. And visit www.askjudgemathis.com!
I've enjoyed answering all of your questions!
@nikkiBLUEiizz Good luck to you!
@holyman03 Thank you. I will do the same for you.
@Tanya_505 Varies by state. In IL, for example, you have 2 years after they turn 18 to pursue it. Check your state laws.
@seriously_vicki We'd need more information...what were you found guilty of, if anything?
@Masta_Tongue_69 There is a process to expunge in every state. Visit www.AskJudgeMathis.com for more info.
@Kaveros No. By law, a landlord cannot evict you simply for filing a lawsuit. That is known as a retaliatory eviction.
@MikeKrawczuk If they made a false statement and you relied on that statement to your detriment, you may be able to break the contract.
@MikeKrawczuk It depends on if the deception went to the terms of the contract.
@holyman03 I have been threatened inside the court. However, they were escorted out by security, arrested and prosecuted.
@forwardmotion76 There's no cause of action for a father who is missing from their child's life.
@LZastrow33 Just tweet them to me
@forwardmotion76 Unfortunately there's no cause of action for neglectful parents or relationship issues.
@leeheymans If under $5k, you can go to small claims. If more, you'll have to hire an attorney and go to a higher court.
@leeheymans If the guilty party's insurance refuses to pay, you must seek a financial judgment in court against both insurer and insured.
@93diamond You can file the suit in your state because that's where the contract occurred.
@Masta_Tongue_69 Visit www.askjudgemathis.com. I list expungment services in several states.
@o_LIVEGIRLS Otherwise, go back to the original judge and request they provide sanctions and penalties against the person who defaulted.
@o_LIVEGIRLS If they don't pay, you may seek garnishment of their wages, place a lien on their assets or get collections atty to enforce it.
@93diamond If promissory note was signed in your state, you can sue them in your state, where the contract occurred.
@Flemingyon If you did not ask specifically ask about the transmission, then I don't believe you would have a case.
@Flemingyon If you asked about the transmission and was told it was fine, then you may have a case.
@Flemingyon That conclusion can only be reached if the buyer asks a question re: a specific part of the car and the answer is misleading.
@Flemingyon If you bought the car as is, no you may not sue. The only exception to the as is law is if there's fraud or misrepresentation.
@nikkiBLUEiizz However, if she were to be convicted I would sentence her to life w/o parole.
@nikkiBLUEiizz It would be an injustice for me to comment on what a jury should or shouldn't do.
@nikkiBLUEiizz As a Judge, I cannot speculate on the verdict that a jury may return in the Casey Anthony trial.
@kdotbeenhot Lawyers have many career options they can pursue. A law degree always enhances a resume for any job you might apply for.
@NikkiBowles55 That provides an avenue to sue in civil court for criminal theft.
@NikkiBowles55 Yes you may sue for conversion. That is using money designated for other purposes for your personal use.
@april757 A receipt will allow you to have the work performed to your satisfaction rather than debating w/ tenant the quality of repairs
@nikkiBLUEiizz I am not familiar with Canadian law at all! Sorry.
@nikkiBLUEiizz If he's picked up for any reason, fingerprints will identify him.
@nikkiBLUEiizz Go to child support enforcement division and seek a warrant for his arrest.
@MikeKrawczuk Yes. Give them @ least 30 days notice to remove their belongings or you will consider them abandoned.
Answering your legal questions until 10:30...ask away!
@april757 Thanks
@Tranadine God and my parents.
@ameariken At that point you may charge storage fees or have the items removed from your property. Check your local landlord/tenant laws.
@ameariken Depends on the laws in your state. Typically 1 30 day written notice would be required.
@1ColorPurple Visit www.askjudgemathis.com...I list all of my community work there.
@PeppyBennett Visit www.askjudgemathis.com and click on the Speaker Request tab!
@nikkiBLUEiizz That could range from being jailed to community workforce.
@nikkiBLUEiizz File a petition for child support and request father be brought before the judge and given some tough love.
@Masta_Tongue_69 Unfortunately, arrests and convictions will show on a background check.
