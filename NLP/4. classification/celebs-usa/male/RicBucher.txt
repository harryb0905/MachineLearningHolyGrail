We covered it all -- how to handle a 4-year old dropping an F bomb, @WillBlackmon's nominee for most gracefully aging NFL player, the (supposedly) fall-off-the-cliff age in the NFL and Russ Westbrook/LeBron James getting-wiser-or-more-decrepit debates: https://t.co/leW7919fwo
One, some teams do, at least as much as they can when they can‚Äôt get early offense (see: Rockets, 2017-). Two, because they‚Äôre not facing end-of-game conditions every possession. Three, a great player doesn‚Äôt have an infinite number of tricks or energy. Familiarity = better D. https://t.co/ygOpUtowWY
Not claiming to be smarter but short answer: NBA scouting &amp; defenses are too good to f--- around. Longer answer: ISO, offense gets to decide best option/best matchup. Run a play &amp; now the D can influence who takes the shot &amp; has the clock on its side. https://t.co/yDwnl143sN
Which is sexier, the √ºber athlete or the couch potato? Turns out it might just be the latter -- short, hilarious pod on the effects of endurance training on the libido: https://t.co/VeJjWwjjqd
The idea that Zion is a fool if he doesn't end his collegiate career now might be the most inane overreaction I can recall -- yet @theryanhollins tried to convince me he is. Also: Ryan wilds out on NBA refs, except, apparently Marc Davis. All that &amp; more: https://t.co/KfsiBuW1GF
We need to up your dosage. The crazy talk is out of hand. https://t.co/djgIjTWtvq
Adam Silver wordsmiths the topic of tampering, why AD's All-Star pronouncement doesn't change a damn thing (nor contradicts AD Sr.) and what KD is really mad at the media about: https://t.co/NLHulnJD23
Or, as we like to say, another episode of ‚ÄúBucher, Friendless.‚Äù I doubt my takes here are going to make me any, either... https://t.co/BkMpLVh7in
What's the best investment @Bucks billionaire owner Wes Edens has ever made? What will it take to keep @Giannis_An34 in MKE? To win a title? And how did he almost check out before buying the team? All here: https://t.co/mkmYYwagOY
Always a treat to get to know the personal side of an NBA power broker who doesn't wear a jersey (but in Wes' case, does wear a helmet and a harness) and hear their view on where the league is and where it's going... https://t.co/Ein3aboFN6
It's a great historical clip, especially for those not familiar with Pistol Pete's greatness. Are you telling me today's ultra fickle fans are pining to watch that All-Star weekend? https://t.co/92UmCYvBed
Spirited convo about "measurables" &amp; how Baker Mayfield defied them; why @WillBlackmon says Baker out-did Saquon last season &amp; why he doesn't get his passes batted despite his limited height; also, why Will chose BC over ND &amp; Wisconsin (Rover?): https://t.co/MEmeRKnnhN
I am not the inventor of this - I just wish I was: Takes the guessing out of getting that perfect roundball feel https://t.co/IvY1upUPJ6     #basketball #perfectpressure #kickstarter @innoflate
Are we leaping to a false assumption on what resolved the Kaep-NFL beef? Also, @WillBlackmon says Antonio Brown's talent is too great for any team to say no; also, an inside look at all that transpired in Charlotte All-Star weekend: https://t.co/j2rGb0N1F2
Explained: Why the dunk contest is, if anything, better than ever but why we as viewers don't think so. Also, what we learned from Team LeBron's comeback... https://t.co/KI8aMVO3Bc
Two reasons: pace is too slow, length of event is too unpredictable for live TV. Skills contest appears to be growing on people -- league wouldn't be raising its profile if it wasn't. And it's ideal for TV. https://t.co/x4OFaQr6Y1
Everybody has short memories. I‚Äôve always felt 3pt &gt; dunk contest but the former isn‚Äôt always better than the latter. I‚Äôll explain on tomorrow‚Äôs @BucherFriends podcast why it‚Äôs harder for us as viewers to be wowed by today‚Äôs contest dunks. (Despite them being infinitely better.) https://t.co/pUcGbY6lWS
Dunk contestants will be in the media mixed zone for interviews momentarily. What we really need are the judges. Diallo aside, I‚Äôve got questions.
New dunk champion Diallo went VC/JRich/LaVine/Aaron Gordon level ‚Äî highest degree of difficulty and made ‚Äòem look the easiest. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
I'm inclined to agree. https://t.co/3k8wot3dug
My man @TheRyanHollins finally begins to grasp the challenging timeline the Lakers face trying to build a championship-caliber team around LeBron; also, who we have winning the Saturday night contests, Sunday's game &amp; impact of Markieff Morris signing w/OKC &amp; not the Lakers... https://t.co/2LcERT9bxp

Nothing quite like ref-on-ref crime, unless it's the player who benefitted from a blown call mocking the argument that the call was actually correct. I've got a few words for anyone pretending a "gather step" isn't really a step, too. https://t.co/ADemIn9k72
Will is always good but he really brought his A game in this one. And by all means let us know how you rate his budding guitar skills... https://t.co/yFg73v4hI9
I have no idea what you're referring to but I have zero doubt you deserved it. https://t.co/sSRwq6dd1U
So @WillBlackmon had his "bell rung," but is that the same as being concussed? And how is your vision flipped upside down but you can recite the order of the months backward perfectly? Will and I discuss that &amp; compare @TheAAF vs XFL (new &amp; old): https://t.co/VFHzlvjLfD

Somehow a trade deadline assessment turned into a debate over which conference is stronger and if it's a fait accompli that the Warriors are winning another title. (Me: It's not. Ryan: It very much is.) Ryan also kills my GM skills, but what does he know? https://t.co/5rLty5sF6g
Flurry of trade deadline moves by top teams in the East, but did the power structure change? And can we now declare the East stronger than the West? Is LeBron recruiting all Stars? @theryanhollins &amp; I discuss, along with Friday night picks ATS &amp; O/U: https://t.co/5rLty5sF6g
Even though 3 of LeBron‚Äôs 5 starters are on my team along w/Embiid, Giannis‚Äô second pick. #crazytalk #makesnosense #whatevs https://t.co/P1kwN9omAH
An entire book could be written on how LeBron has tinkered with his free-throw form over the years. (OK, so maybe it wouldn't be a riveting book, but...) Now he waits until the last second to look at the rim? What is that all about?
What Rich Paul told me he wants made clear about LeBron, AD and the Lakers; where @theryanhollins had hoped to see Marc Gasol land (not Toronto) and why; and what we can expect to see from John Wall the next time we see him: https://t.co/KWUnq39710
You clearly didn't listen to the podcast and guessed wrong on the S-word. But thanks for sharing your opinion, anyway. https://t.co/KLdJvsXFBK

Son of the 'Nati &amp; #Bengals' diehard fan @garyowencomedy + @WillBlackmon try to convince me Zac Taylor was a good choice; Will also explains how NBA stars have impacted NFL players &amp; their approach to next labor deal. All of that &amp; more here: https://t.co/cWcXpIsi81
Also discussed on today‚Äôs ‚Äòcast ‚Äî will this finally be the negotiation the superstars (Brady et al.) join forces with the rank &amp; file to wield true leverage and secure a better labor deal? Will thinks so... https://t.co/t5mu90aDFG
Today‚Äôs podcast with Will and me drops shortly &amp; includes a visit from comedian/actor Gary Owen, who flashed his draft expertise and hyped Montgomery. https://t.co/va1OeiJ8Oa
The breakdown by @willblackmon on how &amp; how not to cover Julian Edelman (by someone who has done it) alone is worth a listen. Also: the giveaway going into the game on Todd Gurley's status and the plays that had to be made for the Rams to have a chance: https://t.co/oADhR4f3jy
Did you know he has a podcast? Yeah. He's as good there as anywhere. Sample: https://t.co/ApQMzbuzY4 https://t.co/ounIMMumSt
Considering the processes/brain trusts for both teams have changed since I wrote that tweet - thereby making the point of the tweet moot - there is no "still." The 76ers have some really good pieces. I have faith the new NYK regime can acquire the same. Appreciate the question. https://t.co/5hwFyx5peV
For my many 76ers' fans, a swag bag tailored especially for you. https://t.co/9rVypQ8EYw
Was dealing DeAndre Jordan a payback by Mark Cuban? @theryanhollins seems to think so; me, not so much. Also: why 2019 is not the fools' errand 2010 was for the Knicks: https://t.co/VtPk9i0IJU
Update: Jason Kidd candidacy w/Lakers has hit a bump, i.e., Byron Scott, his coach w/Nets &amp; revered part of Laker Nation. Byron remains close to Magic/Jeanie &amp; is still creased over Kidd‚Äôs part in his Nets‚Äô firing. Whether or not this takes Kidd out of the running, TBD. https://t.co/s9NXppPBdY
Kudos to @nyknicks' new regime. One GM last week said they would be hard-pressed to get a CJ McCollum/Tobias Harris-level player + a 1st rd pick for him. DSJ &amp; TWO first-rd picks? Crushed it. Kristaps wanted them to pay for previous regime's mistakes and they said: GTFOH.
This was a fun one. @TheRyanHollins is upset over a source telling me Kyrie is open to playing w/LeBron again -- but only because he said the same in last week's podcast and I smashed the idea. (I still think it's lunacy.) AD's future also discussed: https://t.co/VCpr2fblum
Why I never imagined Kyrie ever being interested in playing with LeBron again and how a source convinced me it's a possibility, along with an update on who the next Lakers' coach could be if and when they make a change... https://t.co/sYjBr77bAm
@truesayej I didn't say anything. I talked to stars who explained why playing w/LeBron has its plusses and minuses. Kyrie didn't want to play w/LeBron; now, apparently he's more open to it. We'll see who ultimately joins him - and how.
@mztrrobinson You bet. Thursday's podcast.
From that last practice to kickoff, what does a player preparing for the biggest game of his life do? @WillBlackmon shared the NYG timetable from SBXLVI. The detail is almost comical. Still has his game notes, too: https://t.co/ApQMzbcZ6w
LeBron and Rich Paul hearing that it cost them 50K to openly recruit AD https://t.co/gsZjwf0FaQ
From a man, @WillBlackmon, who has beaten Tom Brady and the Patriots in a Super Bowl: his heart says Rams, his head says Pats. Which one won out and what is his predicted score? Find out here: https://t.co/Ojpa2ICoaB
So @WillBlackmon never made the Pro Bowl, but there was a moment when he thought he had secured his spot, going so far as to celebrate with a hula dance -- only to have it ripped away from him. He's still salty about it. The details here: https://t.co/JXEpsJQsmY
Also: the player at the Senior Bowl who impressed him the most and why, along with the latest example of Will putting all other husbands to shame... https://t.co/aWflOgbGKk
The Warriors haven't lost since Boogie was activated -- how much does he have to do with that? Also: can you help me figure out what Ryan means by "tenured" All-Stars and what it takes to supplant them? https://t.co/T8X0BX1lnJ
I‚Äôll give you my answer to that on tomorrow‚Äôs pod. https://t.co/7mWMK5wm3Y
I cover pro athletes but I‚Äôve always been fascinated by amateur endurance ones and their sacrifices. Lindsay took me to a whole other place here. As honest &amp; thought provoking as any recent podcast I‚Äôve heard - including my own. https://t.co/Q3PTIBg1sb
Ryan claims he crushed me. I‚Äôd say he crushed the secondary point forward market. You be the judge... https://t.co/6dM93sQxw0
Glad you enjoyed it. His answer on how to express an opinion without being tagged a loose cannon by NBA teams - trust me, they‚Äôre more hyper sensitive than you‚Äôd ever imagine - was particularly insightful. The man thinks things through. Worth having around for that alone. https://t.co/3IqCHI9lCg
Now &amp; then I contemplate how much time I lose writing &amp; re-writing &amp; oh %*# why didn‚Äôt I notice that tupo ‚Äî uh, TYPO ‚Äî because I‚Äôm using my thumb on a touch screen &amp; not a keyboard. Damn you, Blackberry. I know you‚Äôre still around but you know what I mean. Damn you all the same.
Also: a 1-A defender w/a post-up game. JJ &amp; Kyle are far more than just shooters but neither is as versatile or can impact a game the way Klay can. The beauty of the Warriors is that they compensate for each other's weaknesses -- but make no mistake, they all have weaknesses. https://t.co/INHzWrCXpO
"sitting" next to me. Excuse the typo.
Enjoyed every bit of this conversation with JD -- and if I were a young player in the NBA, I know who I would want siting next me to on the bench/bus/plane. Tells it like it is but with the young dude's best interests at heart. As GHill and Steve Nash apparently did for him. https://t.co/NCanm9Nc82
Pumped that we finally get to drop this in full tomorrow. Enjoy. https://t.co/RX357f13bu
What's it like to prepare to face a Belichick/Brady-led team in the Super Bowl? @WillBlackmon knows &amp; tells. Also: is Tony Romo really all that prescient, or is he simply reading and sharing what any good NFL QB would see? Will weighs in on that, too: https://t.co/LYljPtjs7k
No one ever said the Patriots suck. What has been said (Brady has shown his age, their last year has been drama-filled) is true. When @WillBlackmon disagreed, I *might* have brought up he was born/raised in New England &amp; went to Boston College: https://t.co/DGYQF51fLd
Something Aqib Talib revealed about Sean McVay caught Will's attention and points to why the Rams never faltered even after falling behind early. Also: how NFL instant replay rules are the real problem with the league's officiating... https://t.co/cXbsCjg3mr
On today‚Äôs podcast, Ryan presented Eric‚Äôs comment as a ringing endorsement that Kyrie could rejoin LeBron. Hmmmm. Other more logical insight and perspective found here: https://t.co/rH5T3Fil3j https://t.co/Hk1DiT0YoV
This pod is so good I wish I could drop it asap. But it is scheduled for next week. The üî• emojis, though, are wholly appropriate. https://t.co/61muLjwiOw
One, you are crazy for suggesting that. Two, are you asking me to give it more credence because Stephen A. agreed with you? https://t.co/AXieDCEA07
Also: Did Kyrie share his call with LeBron as a public apology or surreptitiously put himself on the same level as LeBron? Could it have been both? We discuss... https://t.co/EriS79mTJc

I wrote about an unbound Chris Kaman for the first time here: https://t.co/amzNLaMWvD Caught up with him this week to find out if he was still as outspoken and, um, unique now as then. Answer: Pretty much. https://t.co/CdMmqR5qXC
The versatility argument is specious in this no-contact small-ball era vs MJ's time. LeBron has never, ever, defended, game in and game out, as consistently as Jordan did. Pippen was the primary stopper in the last year or two of the second 3peat. Don't overblow that. https://t.co/OWC6gUoB3x
First Finals I ever covered. Jordan vs. Barkley. Triple OT in Old Chicago Stadium. Horace Grant's goggles. Westphal vs. Phil. What a clash of styles, cities and personalities. You never forget your first and amen to that. https://t.co/th4PLeXXaq
And nothing has changed. I'd be constantly worried LeBron would want me out and replaced by one of his guys. (Which was my point even way back when I originally said it.) No thank you. https://t.co/ZfgkVqKOMR
With Oliver Miller surrounding everybody. https://t.co/k5HGcRBbbr
Keep better notes. https://t.co/l5gfV5ILz3
Loaded episode: @WillBlackmon reminisces about Jon Vilma giving his BC team bulletin-board material and how it impacted the game; the ins and outs of watching film on an opponent; and are Rams an easier hurdle than the Eagles for the Saints? https://t.co/fNSyxXbcb4
Legit argument as best offensive player. Loved watching Charles almost as much as I enjoyed covering him but he never, ever compared to MJ at the other end of the floor. (FYI, neither does LeBron.) #openthefloodgates #whydoIdothis #canthelpmyself #aaaannnndneedstobesaid https://t.co/MxRcLSxHta
My friend @MikeWiseguy tried to dress up his new podcast by getting a woman with a British accent to introduce him. It didn't work. But he did get Jamal Crawford as a guest and both he and @JCrossover have stories for days. Check it out: https://t.co/kwmpee9Tk7
The automatic reaction (by many) to the Rams beating the Cowboys is that Sean McVay out-coached Jason Garrett. @Will Blackmon explains why the Rams' approach belies that theory. Also: the second Will knew the Colts were toast (see: Quenton Nelson): https://t.co/qaBMaRRmxX
Secret formula behind the Patriots‚Äô success unveiled (a little more nuanced than ‚ÄúBill + Tom, duh!‚Äù) &amp; Will compares Andrew Luck to Henry Rowengartner. https://t.co/1D0Eo239Q9

Bucher&amp;Friends podcast going up shortly. @TheRyanHollins and I get to the heart of the Cavs‚Äô motive for helping Patrick McCaw escape GSW control. Ryan shares his experience as a pawn in owner vs owner battles. Also discussed: Kristap Porzingis‚Äô value to NYK and how he‚Äôd fit w/KD.
The Celtics were my pick to win it all this year and the last four games are a glimpse into why. But this Heat game is exactly the kind they've delivered a what-the-%#@-was-that performance before. https://t.co/LtTRS665hZ

Everyone has that one person who keeps them up at night grinding their teeth. @WillBlackmon makes the case Dabo is that for Nick Saban. Also: why it's good Trevor Lawrence *can't* go to the NFL just yet and who will win this weekend in the NFL: https://t.co/2h6J3djCKX https://t.co/3T2FWHA190
I'm counting on Jeff Green because I like living dangerously: https://t.co/2h6J3djCKX
Booger McFarland criticized JJ Watt &amp; Clowney for not getting to Luck. @WillBlackmon explains, in the case of Clowney, why. Also, big debate over the sportsmanship in the last-second timeout before a kick; Will somehow drags flopping into it. https://t.co/gaMyPaXV8l

Santa ain't the only one still working. @WillBlackmon, despite a heavy heart from losing his fantasy SB by 2 pts, names the most dangerous teams in both the AFC and NFC w/the playoffs looming and foreshadows DJ Swearinger getting cut loose by the 'Skins: https://t.co/tkJC92c6gT
I don't think this was the least bit sincere. (The sentiment, not Ryan's laughter. The laughter was genuine, I'm sure of it.)  But, all that said, I'll take it. Happy holidays to everyone out there. May the holidays bring all of you the glee my voice brought @theryanhollins. https://t.co/SFSoRbSokS

Well, @WillBlackmon admitted that he hadn't slept in more than 24 hours when we recorded our latest podcast; perhaps that explains why he made not 1 but 2 (!) bets where he has to dye his hair blond if he loses. Other loopiness ensued: https://t.co/Y9QhD8Mx6o

The Wade-LeBron friendship is one of the most unique in NBA history. Not sure either would be viewed as they are today without the other. All that explained here: https://t.co/ogUgPdReRA
This is what you get on the Bucher&amp;Friends podcast. No equivocating, no sniveling. https://t.co/CLxXbZOz1H
Want to know the real story on the Redskins' approach to Kirk Cousins (me: and why they're looking kind of smart now for it)? Former 'Skin @WillBlackmon has it for you here, along with a lot of other juicy insight: https://t.co/J3W6UNDKgi
Were there four upsets on Sunday or two? Will and I discuss. Also: how Will used Brett Favre as a thermostat... https://t.co/PcnYI0kbMA
A good cause led by a good dude. https://t.co/KR7bPjIhpy
Buried the lede: Ryan‚Äôs story on why he‚Äôd never fight Dirk is gold. https://t.co/6sITpkinyU
Smart man. Much appreciated by the author and, I'm sure, KD. (As for the question, what is it a lawyer says to the judge when the other lawyer asks a witness a slanted question? "Objection, your honor, misleading"? Yeah, that.) https://t.co/0LEe7bAqke
Before Steph wrote back to a 9-year old girl interested in his shoes, he did this for another 9-year-old who just wanted to be part of the Splash Family. (More about where Steph's encouragement has taken her on the podcast.) https://t.co/rQrwe7g3uG
Hornets and TWolves don‚Äôt really have anything in common yet weirdly are a pretty even matchup: https://t.co/icYiEzYBZ1
Raptors HC Nick Nurse is known as an offensive guru, but how he orchestrates his defensive matchups will be the most interesting aspect (for me) of tonight's Sixers-Raptors game: https://t.co/hpmskQVAxu
I know of only one player who would consider trading an MVP for multiple All-NBA 1st team selections. There's also only one player who invited my daughter to be a Splash Sister. My conversations with &amp; reflections about him here: https://t.co/I1BUXBEmV4
And in other news, the Warriors renew their rivalry with the Cavs. Well, kinda. Will JR, Tristan and Channing take exception to the Ws taking exception to the Great Cookie Diss? https://t.co/8Q0hlu9hMo
Had to ask my daughter's permission to do this podcast because she's 15. Dads of teenage girls (still boggles my mind I'm the dad of a teenage girl!) will understand. https://t.co/I1BUXBEmV4
I wrote a story about the yin and yang of playing with LeBron. Couldn't have done it without the frank, on-the-record input from a lot of his peers. A thank you to them. Here it is: https://t.co/iGMo3jc5F4
What's it like to play w/Josh Norman? How did SEA recreate itself on the fly? And can you rightfully say you played in the NFL if you went through a training camp but didn't make the final roster? All of that &amp; more w/the inimitable @Will Blackmon: https://t.co/Do8vzq7Lon
Steph is back, but is he really? https://t.co/oCCNTLiIzV
There's a coach available right now who has the temperament to work with a cerebral, complex QB such as Aaron Rodgers, says @willblackmon. I have my doubts based on how that coach got his previous job. All of that &amp; Will's view of my coaching skills, too: https://t.co/Rmb2bzZ2q9
Mister Connector-of-Dots -- who played for Mike McCarthy -- already has called his shot on where McCarthy coaches next: https://t.co/Rmb2bzHr1z
This is why I love doing a podcast with this dude. Tells it like it is. https://t.co/yQR63VooOc
Who really gained the most from the Warriors-Raptors game Thursday night? @theryanhollins makes some really good points that the Ws did; I just made better ones that the Raptors did. https://t.co/xH5Yrmzsw9
Big picture, Raps were better off weathering KD's 51 &amp; winning in OT than smashing the Ws w/no Steph or Draymond; @theryanhollins is having none of it. Also, every O/U &amp; ATS pick for NBA games tonight. (I was 18-8 last week, Ryan was 17-9.) https://t.co/wWTa7JUfiz
What are the chances New Balance jumped into the NBA shoe game w/Kawhi *without* knowing what market he'll be playing in next season? And why would Kawhi leave Jordan Brand for NB? @theryanhollins and I offer answers here: https://t.co/qG6WkIiI0l
The line tonight for Warriors-Raptors says a lot about how the oddsmakers view We The North. @BovadaOfficial has GSW at +9. The last time they were that big of an underdog? April 2, 2014 to the Spurs. (Lost 111-90.) My thoughts: https://t.co/eL3tgtrkVM
This should give you a taste of who Kyle is and the way he approached the Kawhi situation last season... https://t.co/SGYxxpOuB9
You can't appreciate @KyleAnderson5 unless you know the game &amp; get to know him. Do that here -- our conversation about how he got his nickname (SloMo), visiting long-lost relatives in a China ("They set off fireworks at every house") &amp; the Pop-Kawhi drama: https://t.co/gkW8E3eyMD
If there was one Spur with a completely different view of the Kawhi Leonard saga last season, it was now Grizzlies F Kyle Anderson. We discussed how and why, as well as the Griz' surprising start, his interest in playing for the Chinese Nat'l Team &amp; more: https://t.co/gkW8E3eyMD
We are so debating this on our next podcast. https://t.co/fOSKsOLju5
That's not new. What's (relatively) new are players having stakes in agencies. The management side doesn't particularly like it, but no one I've talked to is so worked up about it that they want to go to war to see it outlawed. https://t.co/2QhUt4u7IC
It's schmaltzy, for sure, but there is something about teams that want to go the extra mile for their coaches simply because they like them as dudes. In NYK-Pistons tonight, we've got two of them. https://t.co/tNVmVDYh35
Latest episode has me calling @WillBlackmon a unicorn for a very personal reason and Will saying Blake Bortles' time in Jax is over. Also, sideline etiquette - don't talk smack about other side of the ball: https://t.co/wAZzmoJWxS
I have yet to speak to any teams on this subject, but as of right now I can't imagine either the No. 1 or 2 picks being dealt. You *can* have too much of a good thing, i.e., picks. A roster full of young players, no matter how talented, never has been a formula for success. https://t.co/971n95UlIG
ICYMI: @WillBlackmon on what he and Richard Sherman have in common when it comes to trash talking, what Baker and Randall's actions toward Hue Jackson told us about *them* and the aura of Andrew Luck: https://t.co/yHdBG5ur6Y
Spurs had a wee bit of trouble stopping a high-scoring √ºber-athletic SF just a couple of days ago -- have they figured out how not to let it happen again? https://t.co/fJjQkQj4bB
Are the Cavs for real? Or is the Derrick Rose resurgence? Which one wins out tonight? https://t.co/YU8Mbj4Ofk
Also: Will shares his reverse-psychology method of trash talking, I put my masters degree from BLU (Body Language University) to work and we discuss the aura of Andrew Luck. https://t.co/JC3fKDHjD0
Hope to have news on that fairly soon. Appreciate the interest. For now it's the podcast (https://t.co/gXoEu2cmVH) and my writing for @BleacherReport and @sportsbetco. https://t.co/cMRtUzEuzq
The string of comments from former Packers started by Will's tweet is like having a seat on the team bus. F-ing hilarious. https://t.co/qjynzJvV4V
All true. Like, tomorrow he‚Äôs going to be droppin‚Äô knowledge on what happened to his Jags, Fournette vs Lawson (who ya got?), did Jameis redeem himself &amp; did Hue earn all that disrespect. (Or at least I‚Äôm going to ask.) And, of course, a breakdown of Packers-Vikings. https://t.co/KXjGRtJGR1
When we recorded,  Bovada lines for that game and Spurs-Pacers weren‚Äôt up yet. Added them in later but if you subscribe to ITunes you got the early version. FWIW, I went 18-8, @theryanhollins was 17-9. In any case, glad you like the pod and thanks for listening. https://t.co/V1yn6hay7k
And I listened. Told you about Suns &amp; TWolves and you didn‚Äôt. https://t.co/K5qz0yvx0i
He's a podcast partner so I may be a bit biased but thought he struck a great balance between analysis, energy and personality. Did NOT sound like someone doing it for the first time, that's for sure. #moreplease #stillneedstimetorecordapodcastthough https://t.co/Ov6EWhPWSY

Two relative no names I‚Äôll take on my team anytime: TJ McConnell and Montrezl Harrell. Dudes just play and play relentlessly hard.
You're not likely to ever hear @WillBlackmon talk bad about the NYG or Dave Gettleman and it has nothing to do w/his SB ring. (OK, maybe it has a liiiittle to do w/his SB ring.) But there are bigger reasons. A story about a team w/a heart: https://t.co/DGUoKM6jpG
The Suns are almost unbeatable...vs. the spread...vs. Eastern Conference teams. Will it matter vs. the Sixers tonight? https://t.co/mU5vHjA6nE
The Thunder haven't won ATS vs. the Kings the last five times out -- does the trend continue with OKC Russ-less in Sacramento? https://t.co/XCOrUOfYzk

Melo's next move, what to infer from the Rockets' beatdown of the discombobulated Warriors, could Steph have the MJ Effect on Trae Young and Ryan Hollins' uncanny feel for how to play the O/U of every game tonight: https://t.co/um95eWMcyI
Never used a üî• emoji before, but @theryanhollins did some work here... https://t.co/3qqX3NfHfd
ICYMI: The move that could trip the Warriors up wasn't KD and Draymond getting into it but how the Warriors opted to handle it, says @theryanhollins. Draymond playing hurt might've impacted the subsequent tiff. Also, did Melo ask to be cut loose? https://t.co/V1lcr5OdbR
Great intel from Ryan on Melo forcing the Rockets' hand, LeBron ruining a historic night, why KD may not be long for GS but not LA-bound, just how bad a sign it is that the Sixers lost Jimmy's debut and why KD had no business being mad at @Money23Green: https://t.co/V1lcr5OdbR
The last team to knock off the Blazers is tonight's opponent -- can they do it again? https://t.co/vQaSBih3Sj
I usually take a photo with my podcast guest, but events during my conversation w/Nik Stauskas at the Blazers' training facility had me a tad shook.

ICYMI: @WillBlackmon on how he earned his biggest fine, the worst on-field gamble he ever made and which upset in the NFL yesterday surprised him most: https://t.co/09VkRt4yZc
Major contrast in styles here. Which one will prevail? https://t.co/oiFgW3ngFz

The Raiders giving blank DVDs/tapes/whatever to JaMarcus Russell says as much about the Raiders then as it did JaMarcus. @WillBlackmon explains here, along with Will's reaction if he were a teammate and Michael Thomas pulled the flip-phone celebration: https://t.co/Z23tKZ5QzA https://t.co/Ya4j2fEMLJ
Let me try this again: most interesting game of the night has to be Celtics at NUGGETS. All the markers point to a particular way to play the O/U: https://t.co/vgXgMo7y8s

Oddsmakers are still skeptical about the Grizzlies. That's good for you: https://t.co/5Q2QYmESt7
Everyone -- it's been fun. Thoroughly enjoyed the exchange with all of you. Got to get on with the world outside my Twitter feed now.
It's not a gradual deterioration. The game and what is emphasized has changed. But in today's NBA: passing, footwork &amp; off-the-ball movement have fallen off. It's why Klay Thompson is a unicorn moving without the ball. And why we have a thousand dribble handoffs every game. https://t.co/bUx2uws57N
We have? Mozart, Picasso, Galileo and freakin' Albert Einstein would like a word with you, too. https://t.co/qZJrEIAKTJ
Which is really my only point. Whether you're for the game in a previous iteration or today, there's no finite way to claim one as superior. We don't have to go that far back for a case in point: '95-96 Bulls vs. current Ws. No discernible way to say one is better than the other. https://t.co/jHxw23K8ng
And if you took GMs/players from 30 years ago and gave them their respective blueprints in the NBA today and said, 'This is what you have to do to make millions and set your family up for life,' you think they'd be inferior? Well, then, Oscar would like to have a word with you.
JJ Barea and Van Vleet? So why are those guys in the league? Why do they torture guys faster, longer and who jump higher? Because being able to play isn't only about being able to shoot from 30 feet or reverse dunk or touch the top of the backboard...
Because I've watched the game for the last 30 years. There are certain individual skills that have improved because they've been emphasized. Others have been lost. Playing is more than all that. You think there aren't 1000 basketball players faster, taller who jump higher than... https://t.co/GinDTZRTZ0
It was barely a pro sport in the 50s. Some of the best collegiate athletes didn't even consider going pro because the $$ was ehh. Maybe there's a way to assess all the changes over the decades to say today's player is better than in the past, or vice versa. But I haven't seen it. https://t.co/s41UfMS3Oy
They are correlated in that as athletes have evolved, the way the game is played has become more simplified to cater to the athleticism. I would contend that with the rise in the number of superior athletes, the number of players with an array of refined skills has diminished. https://t.co/l31VFD1yE2
Again, there's no basis for the assertion that players today are far better than in the past. The number of high-caliber athletes has increased, no doubt, for the reasons you've stated. But that's athleticism. Don't confuse that with ability to play the game. https://t.co/D2qVGiQOUY

I just talked with Tyson in the last few days about playing at home (LA), playing with LeBron, etc. Both were dreams of his but timing was never right. Getting to do both now to round out his career? If Lakers want it to happen, it's as good as done. https://t.co/NPkBkqDO2H
Because I love and care about all of you, I told you to take the Mavs and the points vs. the Lakers. Now I have two more for you for tonight: https://t.co/lrz1uU8dq4
seriously I'd take it personally. I'd tell myself, 'Oh, he thinks this is going to be easy.' But DRose is quiet. He's not going to tell you that." If you think DRose didn't have a grudge vs. the Jazz because being waived was preordained, you don't know how players' minds work.
Last one on this -- Tyson Chandler, asked if DRose would use being waived by Jazz, even if he knew going into the deal it would happen, as motivation to get 50: "Of course he did. As a player, you use anything. I'd watch a guy warm up and if I didn't think he was taking it... https://t.co/8pEr33iUgq
Anthony Davis says he's the best player in the NBA and many have anointed him a superstar. Is he either? @theryanhollins and I discuss, along with why a 1-6 home team would be giving points to a team coming in on a three-game winning streak: https://t.co/HNs2hz8Fuo https://t.co/7ZkjTF1vKM
There is no basis for that assertion. https://t.co/CgRLyfDfPa
Small ask: let‚Äôs put a moratorium in the NBA on noting so-and-so is the first/youngest player to post (some statistical achievement) since (historically great player). It insinuates a false equivalence. Current pace/officiating/style has made statistical comparisons obsolete.
ICYMI: @theryanhollins and I discuss why @DRose is respected so much more by those who have played with and against him than a sizable faction of fans and media. Also, whose shoes he'd borrow when someone in the neighborhood challenged him: https://t.co/WADYaanpg9 https://t.co/CEnvf3HixH
Forget the 50 -- the raw emotion @DRose showed afterward is why I've always been a ride-or-die guy w/him. Above all, he's a kid who made it out of Englewood &amp; never has taken that for granted. We talk about it here: https://t.co/WADYaanpg9
No one said the Jazz mistreated DRose. They waived him. No one even said they shouldn't have. Not to sound all preachy, but this is the Jazz fan searching-for-something-to-lash-out-over act that is so unbecoming. https://t.co/MlKC9JG98E
One more for all the thin-skinned Jazz fans who get outraged when anyone suggests their team/city isn't every player's cup of tea: players consider your trash talk &amp; insults the most vile in the entire league. You have a good team, great org &amp; gorgeous city. Why the insecurity?
Save the victim act. Writers, lazy or otherwise, don't shape the general opinion of players. Nor is anyone marginalizing small markets. As for DRose, when you know a team has no plan for you, you ask out hoping to land on a team that does. Doesn't make it any less ego crushing . https://t.co/nIvrzjJyWT
For those who may not be aware: this was the 1st time DRose faced the Jazz since it got him in the Cavs‚Äô makeover &amp; then waived him. Imagine what it felt like for an ex-MVP to be dumped by a franchise that many players, like it or not &amp; recent success aside, see as a last refuge.
Agree 1000%. Pass the word. I hate to think there are people out there missing out on a true up-and-comer. https://t.co/CXDd4l4i3k
There are three paths a superstar can take when injuries/age diminish who he is: walk away, blindly insist he's still a superstar or, the hardest, grind to become the best new version of himself he can be (i.e., JKidd/Grant Hill). @DRose has clearly made his choice. Respect.
It will surprise you not at all that tomorrow‚Äôs Bucher&amp;Friends podcast with @theryanhollins addressed my preference of DRose over LeBron some 5-6 years ago. https://t.co/eq3wVZCMDd
Former NBA G/asst coach Rick Brunson w/an honest assessment of his son Jalen's game right now, why @mcuban and the Mavs value players like his son &amp; Luka Doncic (and other teams don't) and the Jimmy Butler he coached in Chi &amp; Minn: https://t.co/5L6it6gQfE https://t.co/vsIAPNxkXX

NFL Network: I know you felt a need to address the tragedy in Pittsburgh. Acknowledge the moment of silence and move on. Talking about a city ‚Äúbouncing back‚Äù trivializes what happened. There is a sickness in our nation right now and this is a lot more than shaking off a bad day.
Luke Walton seeing LeBron James' "You know where to find me" tweet to fired Cavs' coach Ty Lue. https://t.co/fcP7TKY4MT
Dear Harry, this might not be the best time to hold up the NCAA as a beacon of intelligence or suggest that it is something other than the most corrupt, greedy institution in sports. https://t.co/G2xXl3xhOT P.S. The quality of play should be on trial, too. https://t.co/ZORqSqwIBm
Need this World Series‚Äô game to end. I‚Äôm running out of snacks.
Divac wasn't on that team, otherwise that's a cinch -- he hasn't stopped yet. I'd be stunned if Cureton wasn't one. Robert Reid would be my second guess. Reminds me of when I asked Robert Parish if he subscribed to the medicinal benefits of marijuana. Chief: "Not publicly." https://t.co/1SNXefR67I
Even Solomon Hill said he was there to get into their huddle, not to "set up on defense." Unless you think he's lying and he had a brilliant, secret plan to guard Atkinson. Or the whole team was going to guard the Nets' bench. Which is a novel idea. Stupid. But novel. https://t.co/wIXQFXlipR
There is no buzzer and the length of a timeout never has been strictly enforced. The ref was there to tell them to get on the court. You want to set precedent that teams infiltrate the opposing team‚Äôs huddle? It‚Äôs a form of instigating. Don‚Äôt reward it. It‚Äôs bush league. https://t.co/gq8yAgiTnM
‚ÄúHands on people‚Äù? He pushed an opponent out of his team‚Äôs huddle. About as casually as he could and still stop his forward progress. Nobody was assaulted. Don‚Äôt overthink this. What was he supposed to do, let him peer over Atkinson‚Äôs shoulder at their last-second play? https://t.co/2awqhPV8oc
You talked me into going with the Pelicans and giving the 9.5. I got some ?s for you, too. https://t.co/Uo9AHI8ppp
Of course, it never gets to that if D‚ÄôAngelo Russell doesn‚Äôt showboat by trying a no-look pass while all the Nets have to do is keep the ball. I want to punch something and I don‚Äôt even have a dog in the fight. https://t.co/XZX1AXBNPs
For as smart as the NBA often is, I don‚Äôt get how they whiff this badly. If my coach is drawing up a play, I‚Äôm not letting an opposing player walk into my huddle. Should‚Äôve been a T on Solomon Hill for walking into the Nets‚Äô huddle &amp; another T for flopping. https://t.co/AxZ0sn9Sj9
ICYMI: @TheRyanHollins and I discussed the end-of-game issues the Thunder have and whether it's correctable with their current personnel. Entire conversation, along with sober looks at Steph's 51 and the Nuggets' hot start all here: https://t.co/jexVRlxe8X https://t.co/HtuHjpKcmz
No. The circus shots aren't what have made the Warriors champions or Steph an MVP. They're eye candy. Delicious, spun-from-the-sweetest-nectar imaginable, but eye candy nonetheless. Lived off them? Yeah, if you're good with eating once a month. https://t.co/0KlYxGmPpf
'Better' is subjective. Which is more replicable? Deep pull-ups in transition are dunks the other way if they miss. (I say none of this to discount that Steph is on a different level overall this year.) I can marvel at what he did &amp; still say you can't live by those shots. https://t.co/SExFl2I0wY
In today's Bucher&amp;Friends podcast, @TheRyanHollins and I on what we learned from Celtics-Thunder and Nuggets-Lakers. Also provided: best wagers for tonight's games and why Steph's 51 was ridiculous -- and so is attaching MVP connotations to it... https://t.co/jexVRlxe8X https://t.co/spvywVXE4C

He's talking about this: https://t.co/wyOiaZeRnQ Check it out for yourself. https://t.co/mMORU5KqIh
Who falls out of the NBA for 4 years and makes it back? Other than, that is, MarShon Brooks, now with the Grizzlies on a multi-year deal. We discussed all he has learned from the journey. Also: the Rondo-CP3 beef and coming next: Rondo-LeBron: https://t.co/njaNDlxGxs https://t.co/8MybvL28OU
@j13records Maybe because people keep revising history/making stuff up. He opted out instead of being cut to get out on the market early (because agents aren't stupid). He underwent three surgeries and the arduous rehab to get back to playing -- &amp; he hasn't stopped keeping himself in shape.
Judging him by a team record is worse. Which is where this started. You bring in college stats into an NFL convo as an example and you want to talk about using common sense? In either case, Kaep didn't "suck" and Hurts wasn't "killing" the offense. https://t.co/JQdUOk7jWC
By the way, that other distraction, Eric Reid, won a game for the Panthers Sunday. So it is possible to take a stand for social justice and play great football. Not an either/or. https://t.co/364fH0hr81
Yeah, that‚Äôs why his teammates gave him the Len Eshmont award, highest team honor. Try again. I‚Äôm well aware of Kaep‚Äôs flaws as a QB, but who is he distracting? You? POTUS? The networks? The vast majority of NFL players support him. The distraction card is an alibi with no basis. https://t.co/2UlLsUgwmS
I am seeing a different @blakegriffin23. Dwane Casey is a defensive coach, but making Blake a high-post playmaker is smart. Always felt his handle and passing were underutilized. Seems to be making him more decisive overall. Looks as if he picked up some Motor City swag.
Kaepernick played on a team that went 3-16 those two years. Threw for 16 TDs vs 4 INTs his last year. If that sucks, there are at least a dozen starting QBs in the league right now that suck more. https://t.co/o317SenfVb
They better keep it reallllllly quiet. Like, so quiet LeBron doesn't hear about it. I don't believe either LeBron or the Lakers has title contention in mind this season, but if the Lakers crater it will do major damage to LeBron's brand and, for some, his legacy. https://t.co/OmosEqz3Me
It's not a hot take, it's resolute faith: @WillBlackmon says the Jags can still go to the Super Bowl w/Cody Kessler at QB. Is this the time to sign Kaep? Would he abandon his collusion suit? And insight into when Cam will and won't throw a block: https://t.co/EEuYn0xq8H https://t.co/EJDgWjCVd0

Hearing OKC C Steven Adams describe what it's like to keep up with Russ is worth the download alone, IMHO. Stay for the discourse on why this is (or should be) the year Russ puts it all together and why Mahomes &amp; Rodgers are the same unicorn. https://t.co/OLzJ1HPZ9Q
Lot of quality suggestions for that third QB. Explaining why none of them quite work will be part of tomorrow's @BucherFriends podcast. Even if it ends up costing me a few friends.
Aaron Rodgers, Pat Mahomes. Is there a third QB who has their combo of physical ability (legs and arm), creativity &amp; unflappable confidence under pressure? Lot of guys close or stronger in one area but short the overall package. (In case you wondered: yes, I'm all in on Mahomes.)
Nicole tries to convince me I shouldn't fall for the Bengals' okeydoke, I explain why I'm all in on the NFL doing whatever it takes to protect QBs &amp; a healthy discussion about ratings being up and Earl Thomas' bird: - https://t.co/dUuKYnO2EM #iTunes https://t.co/uulyCivbgI

I'm not attacking his social influence. I don't equate popularity/IQ/anything else w/followers. Twitter is, and has been, part of my job for 8+ years &amp; I haven't broken 7K tweets. I was blown away by someone tweeting 48K times just to talk $%#*. https://t.co/t9YEVS47yK
LOL. I'm not the one diminishing Tiger by suggesting there are a bunch of Tigers today or that this Tiger = pre-injury/Elin-with-a-driver Tiger. By the way, 48K tweets generating 348 followers? Might I suggest you get off Twitter and do something constructive? https://t.co/LnS8eQ5AWv
Nah. Former PGA Tour pro John Maginnes said it on my show today: vintage Tiger was the longest driver, had the best short game &amp; best putter. He could take &amp; make shots no one else could. Now? Now he's in the mix thanks to his mental game. He used to be in a class unto himself. https://t.co/zlXjPuJk5b
Context. Scores are relative. As for vintage Tiger: From 1999-2006, he won 36 tournaments, 11 majors, led in scoring every year and $ earned all but one. Finishing sixth, then second, in consecutive majors is not vintage Tiger nor was a great back 9 to finish second "epic." https://t.co/sPM9GUxGPJ
I'm thrilled to see Tiger get back to this level -- wasn't sure he could or would. But to suggest yesterday proves he's vintage Tiger is an insult to what he was. One day, or a back 9, of great golf doesn't make for a tournament winner and damn sure doesn't make for old Tiger. https://t.co/E8Yi1m2ZSC
If by back you mean back to old Tiger, no. That one is gone forever. Yesterday convinced me of that more than ever -- everything going his way and he *still* couldn't hunt down Koepka. But seeing this Tiger compete with all the young whippersnappers is entertaining, for sure. https://t.co/18rJ1IRodE
The beauty of being locked out of my @facebook account for a week now w/no explanation (including erroneous e-mails falsely saying I've been granted access again) is that I realized I don't need @Facebook. For any "friends," it's not me, hasn't been for a week &amp; won't be again.

First weekend of LV Summer League I asked a rival GM about Kawhi going and staying in Toronto. "No chance," he said. "He was in the All-Star Game there. Never left his room. He hates the cold."

Let‚Äôs not pretend the Lakers aren‚Äôt vetting every single move w/LeBron. So why Lance, JaVale and Rajon? They all have showed no fear of LeBron on the court. They can‚Äôt get guys that fit him on one-year deals so they‚Äôre getting guys he at least respects.

How to add to a legendary status, decades after you last played: Charles Barkley thanks several legends in the room at the NBA TNT awards. Last but not least, is Bill Russell - who, smiling, gives Chuck the finger.
I asked several execs, pre-draft, to pick this year's Donovan Mitchell, i.e., guy who'd go mid-1st round but be an unexpected star. One asst GM said Grayson Allen: "Like Mitchell, he‚Äôs got a live body. Tough as nails. Can really shoot." Lightning strikes twice in the Wasatch?
Variety of concerns have Michael Porter, Jr. sliding. Not out of the lottery, but don't be surprised if it's out of the top 10.
The 2 GMS who picked directly ahead of the Jazz &amp; didn't take Donovan Mitchell no longer have jobs. Tonight's decisions could put a few GMs out of work as well. A look at why this draft is fraught with peril: https://t.co/al6cdQtaoG via @BleacherReport
Only proving the folly of an argument based on stats, no matter how advanced, in basketball. Steph is unfairly maligned as a defender - he was a + in the Finals - but there is no basis for suggesting he‚Äôs better than Klay. D rating has a certain value but it‚Äôs hardly definitive. https://t.co/7Pki6JIW29
Thought I'd write a short take on Thursday's draft from the perspective of GMs trying to make personalities mesh as much as talent. Turned out to be not so short: https://t.co/al6cdQtaoG via @BleacherReport

@davdavies I'm sure those numbers had a lot to do with it. I just had hoped the voters would've watched the actual games. KD had a great stat line in G1 and almost singlehandedly gave the Cavs a chance to steal it -- and I'm not talking about just failing to box out JR.
@doctor_resnik Tell that to LeBron, Doctor. "I let the emotions get the best of me and pretty much played the last three games with a broken hand." - LeBron James
Nick Young is a champion, Steph Curry wasn't named Finals MVP and LeBron James played 185 minutes, scoring 85 points, grabbing 26 rebounds and dishing 32 assists with a broken right hand in the Finals -- three things I'm having a hard time believing right now.
KD making sure Nick Young doesn‚Äôt turn into JR Smith: One second left in the 1Q, KD about to take his second FT, says to Swaggy P, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt f-ing foul nobody!‚Äù üòÇ https://t.co/GH1HlbrQf9

Unsolicited ‚ÄúWar-ri-ors‚Äù chant rises from stands. See Mr/Ms Game Operator? You don‚Äôt need that lame ‚ÄúMake Some Noise‚Äù prompting. Not for this crowd.
...and then Steph happened. #TheFinals
Timeline flooded with complaints about a favorable whistle for the Ws. FWIW, current count: Ws 22 fouls, Cavs 10.
Warriors playing w/fire or incapable of pulling away, take your pick ‚Äî this remains a very gettable game for LeBron &amp; Co.
JR Smith's blunder followed his offensive rebound. Off a FT! Cavs had 19 to Ws' 4. Major Ws' FAIL lost in the sauce. I'll discuss that &amp; everything else w/@HowardBeck, @Channing_Frye &amp; @rod_strickland, 12-2p PT @SiriusXMNBA
Riiiiight. We've never seen calls overturned or issues w/replay reviews in MLB or the NFL. Stop. It's not a perfect world in any sport. Nothing egregious happened tonight. Eliminate instant replay &amp; stick w/the call, right or wrong? I'm good w/that. But that's not where we are. https://t.co/Jce2wALjoD
...And the Ws win by 12 if Livingston makes the J, salvaging a push. Keep up. https://t.co/s48sjeDPsf
Malloy, the slot ref, raised the restricted area question. Green's foot WAS in the restricted area when the collision occurred, so it's understandable why he would from his angle. I understand why the Cavs &amp; their fans feel hosed, but the refs wanted to get it right. And did. https://t.co/UZiNd9UkMU
Had all the gamblers who took the points on my mind in OT. Ws had no chance of covering in regulation, then nearly did in OT thanks to a rare Draymond 3 and a near Steph TO that turned into a Klay 3. Livingston hits that J and...hmmm, you don't think...
Just a hunch: they used it as an excuse to review to make sure they got the call right. Brothers clearly wasn't sure because he and Maurer looked at each other before Mauer made the call. I'd like to know what Malloy said when they met to discuss it. https://t.co/p0dEYnToha
You can be moving. You can't be moving toward the offensive player. They ultimately got the call right, but I fully understand why the Cavs feel, as Fiz would say, they got "rooked." @BleacherReport https://t.co/3puHRRy0ol
So smooth he clearly travelled and Reggie couldn‚Äôt see it on slo-mo instant replay. Then again, I was around when Reggie made an art of fooling the refs, too. https://t.co/2Tx7U9MHXn
Nick Young, Quinn Cook, McCaw. Zaza, DWest to mop up and I‚Äôm having a flashback: I covered teams like this as a Warriors‚Äô beat writer in the ‚Äò90s.
KD, Nick Young, Livingston, Bell &amp; Looney to close 3Q. Ws‚Äô fans are hoping Steve Kerr is the national anthem singer who simultaneously did an upside-down painting of the Statue of Liberty - unclear what he‚Äôs up to but hoping it produces something in the end that makes sense.
Klay Thompson‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt say much but, man, his play at both ends this third quarter has been a primal scream.
The allowances on screens in general has gotten completely out of hand. Guys move, hold, extend knees and elbows, you name it. League has clearly decided P&amp;Rs are going to be a free-for-all. It‚Äôs why so many teams automatically switch now. https://t.co/S5R2b0m1ry
It‚Äôs JaVale. Just look at the bottom of the check he must be cutting you. https://t.co/IAyOO55U82
Casual close-outs, lazy one-handed passes, giving up second-chance points. Warriors continue to ooze confidence ‚Äî and they‚Äôre drowning in it.
First WCF game I‚Äôm seeing live, in person. TV cameras don‚Äôt capture the absolute hitch Kevon Looney and Jordan Bell put in the Warriors‚Äô offensive flow. Grinds to a halt every time they touch the ball.
On another front: Caps vs. Golden Knights is about as good as we could‚Äôve hoped for, story-line-wise, for the Stanley Cup. Hyped to watch. Hope it delivers. (Looking at you, Mr. Ovechkin.)
I picked the Celtics to win in 6 before the series started. They have more talent, athleticism &amp; versatility. But pressure can have an amazing effect on all that if you give into it. https://t.co/gAmiP39HQK
Really? The ESPN I know is all about hot takes. P.S. I asked out of my deal with them. Wanted a schedule that would allow me to be a dad. But you go with whatever makes you feel good. https://t.co/KhaoT4hq44
Not my fault you don‚Äôt listen to my SXM radio show. Have beaten that drum consistently. Try again. https://t.co/TYGgcxDzhM
Close-out game to go to the NBA Finals is an entirely different animal. I‚Äôm not saying they can‚Äôt do it, but they were up 21 w/10 min left &amp; got tentative. It‚Äôs where having a guy who says, ‚ÄúI got this‚Äù is invaluable. Stevens tried to make Horford that guy &amp; it didn‚Äôt work. https://t.co/uf29CCqFwx
Actually, you can. I‚Äôm doing it right now. https://t.co/JrhMOFVbcH
Tatum missed a layup. And a FT. And had Korver ISOed &amp; couldn‚Äôt decide what to do. That‚Äôs not the Tatum I‚Äôm used to seeing. Jaylen got the yips on 2 open 3s. Rozier missed a layup &amp; was looking to get the ball to Horford high rather than attack. They didn‚Äôt close, they survived. https://t.co/KkEn4Ihbpk
LeBron is tired, Steph/CP3 is hurt...can we all promise each other we‚Äôll stop trotting out these lame excuses every time one of them under-performs? Didn‚Äôt we use to point out maladies to underscore a heroic performance, not excuse its absence? https://t.co/mcGoVut2Xb
To put it another way: the way the Cs closed tonight gives me little confidence they‚Äôll win Game 6. Or 7.
Yes, we are. The difference, apparently: You watch the scoreboard. I watch how they play. Cs froze, Cavs just coukdn‚Äôt take advantage. P.S. I was watching on slight delay. https://t.co/zPZdmr5tuR
This is what I love about the playoffs: there is nowhere to hide, no time to rest, no way to pretend you‚Äôre something you‚Äôre not. That old line about finding out exactly what you/your team/your coach are made of ‚Äî it‚Äôs true.
Celtics‚Äô youth &amp; lack of a true star (Kyrie) is showing. Rarely see a team at home up by double digits play as tight as they are right now.
Cranky Bucher here, rolling my eyes at the latest: all the words spilled on Steph being attacked on D, a trend that is 3+ years' old. The Ws have won &amp; lost (mostly won) w/teams doing that. It wasn't why the Rockets won G2. There, I feel better. Carry on.
I‚Äôve had to write R.I.P way too many times this year for people who were important parts of the NBA family for me and many others. Rasual Butler, Dan Fegan &amp; now Bret Bearup. All of them giants in their own unique ways, all gone far too soon. Prayers up &amp; out to all.
No, I‚Äôm confirming that the coaches award shouldn‚Äôt be confused with the league award. Casey‚Äôs coaches‚Äô COY win is being used as a reason to act alarmed about his firing. He did a nice job in the reg season but I‚Äôm fairly confident he‚Äôs not winning the traditional award. https://t.co/NViOB2Szbm
I will say this: the whole ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù description is complete bullsh*t. It‚Äôs not some magical system. Stevens can coach, he has a crew of talented young guys desperate to prove themselves &amp; tough ego-less vets. That‚Äôs a winning combination. Emphasis on the last word. https://t.co/S41DjXUFTI
There is the coaches‚Äô award, which is all of two years‚Äô old, and then there‚Äôs the League award, which is voted on by 125 media members and has been around since the 1962-63 season. FWIW, my ballot read: 1, Stevens; 2, Quin Snyder; 3, Dwane Casey. https://t.co/nzUcV2Zjp5
Three reasons: he‚Äôs relatively new to the NBA fraternity; his peers believe he has a pretty sweet set-up; they have no concern his job is in jeopardy. (Which they did, presciently, w/Casey.) Got that from a couple of present/former coaches. https://t.co/n0bfhfF0QF
Nothing is too crazy when it comes to Danny Ainge. That said, and as much as I like Rozier, let's not suggest his postseason resume compares to Irving's just yet. https://t.co/uHQOQMHpMT
Let's not confuse the two. The long-time NBA COY award is selected by the media. The award Dwane Casey won is chosen by the coaches and is all of two years old. To answer the question: George Karl was fired by the Nuggets a month after being named 2013 COY. https://t.co/uUcBuXJcuG
ICYMI: Wondered how a player such as Klay Thompson -- supremely confident yet low maintenance yet highly skilled yet willing to do the dirty work -- is created. I found out here: https://t.co/xKo7j7jdNu
Re: LeBron's game-winner and the question that hasn't been asked, as far as I know -- would he have taken that same shot if they'd been down 1? I say: No chance. It's a H-O-R-S-E shot. Underscoring how little regard he has for the Raptors.
LeBron has clowned the Raptors this entire series. Never more so than on that last shot.
The G2 loss should count as 2 for the Raptors. Cavs should only need to win one more to close this out. It's the humane thing to do.
Listening to a lot of NBA action on SXM lately and have to say: there‚Äôs no one I enjoy more than Celtics‚Äô @SeanGrandePBP. Informed, concise, fair, energized. Truly hope he is appreciated by Celtics fans in particular and NBA fans in general.
That‚Äôs what would make this year special - LeBron has never had to be everything as much as he has to be everything with this team. (As an aside, it‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt understand why he picked this year, of all years, to play 82 games.) https://t.co/N48CW2GyhD
Lesson #3: Teams often put their worst defender on the other team's best scorer, knowing they're going to have help anyway. Second newsflash: KD WAS their big in the starting lineup. McGee, Bell &amp; Pachulia have yet to play. https://t.co/LbnwpjW4oF
Three different guys have blown by him already. They got the ball to whoever he was guarding early. I get that not everyone knows what they're watching, but then to get snarky on top of it...Yeesh. https://t.co/D9i08eZK1p
Orrrrr you didn't know what you were watching last series. He's never been a good defender, but they could hide him plenty against the Blazers, which is how he averaged 38 mpg and 18 ppg, both waaayyyy over his reg season averages. Pay attention. https://t.co/DljzsGUqXH
I don't know if Mirotic's +/- will ultimately show it, but his personal point scored/points allowed count is going to be ghastly in this series unless he scores 20+. Long way of saying it's going to be hard to hide Bald Face (still getting used to the new look) on D.
New reality for Pels: Ws are a lot longer than the Blazers, attacking the rim won't be as easy. New reality for Ws: Pels have a lot more playmakers &amp; athleticism than the Spurs had, have to stay defensively locked in for longer stretches.
The Thunder fell waaaayyyy short of contending for a title. Why this season still has to be considered a success: https://t.co/k4G4EfIfK3

After his last 3, Westbrook shook his head, mean-mugged and shouted, ‚ÄúNot going home. Not today!‚Äù He had 12 pts on 5 of 16 shooting at the half. Now 12 for 20 in the 2nd half for 33 more.
Whatever you want to say about Russell Westbrook, you can‚Äôt question his pride. Dude does not go down without a fight.
Aaaannnd Phil hadn't inexplicably poisoned his team by ripping Melo or insisting it run The Triangle. We'll never know if The Process would've built this Sixers' team (a team I love, FWIW). But puh-lease don't stop RTing the 2015 tweet. It tickles me to no end. https://t.co/8YdmW4LpSz

I hope NBA HQ has appreciated the Heat-76ers' &amp; Blazers-Pelicans' series as much as I have. The league needs more heated competition, not less. Feels as if there's been a concerted effort to outlaw it in recent years.

Channing Frye AND Richard Jefferson (Road Trippin‚Äô duo) on my @MadDogRadio show (ch 82) at 4 pm. I suspect something about their former team &amp; teammate (Cavs, LeBron) will come up.
That's a moral argument that applies to everything, no? We're talking Harden, LeBron and Russ, not Plato, Socrates &amp; Kant. I need a meerschaum pipe, a fireplace and an overstuffed leather chair before I enter that debate. Maybe not even then.üëçüèºüëäüèº https://t.co/oBWaJBzyvG
The move is a step forward simultaneously with the dribble, then a step back with the second foot coming back as a square-up. Harden will jab *after* the dribble, then step back -- sometimes twice -- then bring the other foot back. https://t.co/ZZ285v3gxW
Dude: his step-back isn't categorically a travel. But he often travels (and gains an unfair advantage doing so) on his step-back 3. And his Euro step move. That said, I still put him at the top of my MVP ballot. https://t.co/lJvWPGXLWW
Oh, stop with the I'm-a-fan-so-I-can't-be-put-in-check. The NBA is more popular than ever &amp; how the game is called has changed a half-dozen times since I've been covering it. I shouldn't have said amateur refs -- I should've said armchair never-ever-done-it refs. https://t.co/eH1HLsCbMs
It's not good footwork. It's cheating to get back on balance, which is a challenge to achieve on a step-back shot, especially from range. Good footwork is jabbing, stepping back and being able to square up and fire away. https://t.co/oNb402jmeB
The Euro step has changed the travel call without anyone ever officially saying so. It used to be 1 1/2 steps. Now it's 2-2 1/2. But all you amateur refs out there, please save the just-make-the-call. There are technically 1K travels a game. Technically. Can't call 'em all. https://t.co/lqsNYxtNKx
Harden continues to find ways to bend the rules in his favor. (That said, a lot of guys are doing it.) He did it with the arm-extension sweep &amp; the NBA cracked down. I expect they'll do the same w/this. Players are always looking for an edge &amp; leagues are always playing catch-up. https://t.co/pSN2eBNA3D

The bulk of today's game is 5 interchangeable guys on D who can all score some kind of way. Zaza is a warm-up act. Bottom line: Faried doesn't help Ws. https://t.co/XUJA9KBWmO
I have to question how many of you actually watch basketball. Zaza can and will knock down a mid-range J &amp; is remarkably efficient finishing around the rim for a land-bound dude. And he only averages 15 min a game. https://t.co/xGLSHBvDBv
On the roster, yes. Part of the regular rotation, no. https://t.co/mzDYKdZZll
Nobody who wants to win a championship can afford to have a non-shooter (or let's say non-scorer) on the floor. Not in today's NBA. Ws' offense also relies on high basketball IQ. Faried might have one, but the way he's been used has never reflected it. https://t.co/doBS2lYzE5

If there's one guy in the league I can see attempting it, it's him. https://t.co/3hBfdQjjez
Amazed by those who don‚Äôt understand how invaluable Klay Thompson is to the Ws‚Äô make-up: All-Star talent who could average 30 but happily serves as a defensive stopper, scores like a go-to guy when asked and is as low maintenance as they come. I‚Äôve never seen one quite like him.
Everybody‚Äôs focussed on the wrong aspect of that story - a half dozen other dominoes have to line up for his interest in Ws resulting in anything. The disgraceful part is the Cavs are struggling &amp; if the sources are legit, their best player has his mind elsewhere. https://t.co/rZIjzf616a
The first headline I saw (Biggest Bust in Baseball Retires) is as click-baity as they come. It's also an odd time to pitch you on a baseball story with SB52 days away &amp; the NBA in full swing. That said, I found this piece by Joon Lee a great read: https://t.co/CYn7P3EaHz

Sickens me that Larry Nassar was allowed to do what he did for as long as he did by people in power. Also sickening: hurrahs from the powerless when people in power vilify the mainstream media. The media's power + a few powerless brave souls got it done when no one else dared.

NBA Advanced Stats says GSW's starting lineup today (KD/Draymond/McCaw/Bell/Klay) had previously appeared in 4 games for an average 12.7mpg &amp; a +/- of 1, one of their lesser effective lineups. Kerr looked comfortable doubling those minutes vs. Cavs.
I'm also not a Luddite, but I've had my fill of instant replay in every sport. I'm good with putting it on the shelf until we have a way to use it succinctly while getting the fairest results.
I just can't get that worked up over the no calls on LeBron down the stretch. Could he have gone to the line? Sure. But few initiate as much contact as he does &amp; he gets more than his share of phantom calls.

I'm sure you've seen this but on the offhand chance you haven't, a little reading to prep for tonight's GSW-OKC showdown -- KD on his feelings, post-title/post-tumultuous summer, about all things Thunder: https://t.co/ZCH7mAYKTr via @BleacherReport
Not to overwhelm you w/material, but  the problems with (and cure for) Lonzo Ball‚Äôs shot were analyzed by some of the best shooting coaches I know here: https://t.co/6iUDhCFoWk
I intended this story to be primarily about the Thunder franchise‚Äôs move and how it impacted its young star, Kevin Durant. Then I spoke with KD and he hijacked my plan with his candor &amp; reflection on, well, everything: https://t.co/eMzdroVjDR
Been there several times, always enjoyed the visit. You‚Äôre assuming that was a slight. I was merely thinking of Luke having to move his family to OKC and then abruptly move again (at the start of the school year, no less). https://t.co/eYcxfBBTEM
And since I'm at it: LeBron might've meant his slight for Phil Jackson, but he made Frank Ntilikina an undeserved casualty. Can't see how the former was really worth the latter.
And this is how we get lost in the minutiae. Caught his toe on the court/Larkin + subtle push off doesn't = shook. He tripped. Similar gripe for dudes getting mocked for challenging a dunk. IMO: Still more honorable than ducking out of the way. https://t.co/PSEozI7ha0
Nah, some days I'm just better equipped to deal with it than others. Note to self: Mondays might not be one of those days. https://t.co/SeaYAWjYzT

What went wrong, then right, for JaVale McGee https://t.co/fvg4mCn78R via @BleacherReport
To be clear, for those teams with multiple picks (like ORL): Euro stash pick would be in 20s, not lottery.
Outside of the top 5 craziness, word is the player who could wreak mock-draft havoc is Michigan's DJ Wilson, jumping from 20s to teens.
Teams most likely to take a Euro on the layaway plan if they can't move/improve their pick: Jazz, Spurs, Magic, Raptors, Thunder.
Cle, Ind, Bos &amp; NY have generated the most buzz but other teams hoping to make a big move are CHI, SA, MIN, OKC &amp; DET. Could be a fun night.
Pre-draft buzz: SA among those looking to get to 4 to take Josh Jackson. FWIW: Suns went hard after Aldridge when he was a UFA.

Patently false talking point: Ws added KD to a 73-win team. Lost 6 players, incl 2 starters. Last year's Ws, healthy, beat this year's Cavs.
Cavs have to be loving this tempo.
JR Smith drained his last 2 pregame shots from the exact spot he drilled that 3 to close the first half. Ws up 11, still looking shaky.
16-0 run by Warriors. Breathtaking unravel by the Cavs.

There was absolutely no reason for Steph to undress LeBron just now. Other than, of course, all the talk about him not being capable of it.
Add to last post: Ws clearly testing Steve Kerr's health in his first game  back. Nothing aggravates him more than unforced TOs.
The Ws apparently looked at that 4-TO performance in G1 &amp; said, "Let's not do THAT again." They've got 12 with 3 min left in the 1st half.

Warriors have 2 TOs halfway through the 3Q and they haven't even been particularly sharp. Cavs just not making the game very hard for them.
Also fair to say @StephenCurry30 is moving jjjjjjust a bit better than he did last Finals -- and that @KyrieIrving has never moved better.
Fair to say LeBron has received a favorable whistle so far.

It's not an argument. You want to stump for LBJ, do it when the voting occurs - at the end of the reg season. I didn't hear much of it then. https://t.co/5yzCXFCJn7
I don't mind Reggie/CWebb wailing that LeBron isn't an MVP finalist. But tell us who isn't worthy among the 3 (Russ/Harden/Kawhi) that are.

LeBron/Russ weren't unanimous 1st team (by 1 vote). Harden was. Heads explode. Me: save your outrage for far more worthy causes.
One man's take: if contract $$$ is going to be tied to All-NBA honors in today's positionless NBA, the positions voting framework has to go.
No All-NBA for Paul George = $30m less for Pacers to offer him to stay, increases volume of already rampant PG-to-Lakers buzz. https://t.co/a4OHLI1EHC

Oracle lit for first time after 3 Warriors hit the floor for loose ball, resulting ultimately in Steph FTs.
Not down with the pull-up 3 on a one-man break in a tied game. Warriors (KD &amp; Klay) just tried, and missed, two of 'em.
@Money23Green, who just Spaldinged Vonleh, is flirting with a triple-double (9p, 8a, 9r) midway through third quarter.
Never said I did. My ballot: Brogdon, Saric, Jamal Murray. Embiid would've been 1st if he'd done what he did for more than 786 min/31 games. https://t.co/06wvNnMFXk

Apparently, being 22 and sealing a playoff W is not something you're allowed to get excited over. #freeGiannis
Lots o'great NBA action today but giving Giannis a T for yelling "Yeah!" and an air punch after a blocked shot is absolutely embarrassing.
Felt good about Malcolm Brogdon at the top of my ROY ballot; feeling even better seeing him play like a poised vet vs. Raptors in G1.
And let's be clear: original tweet was Nov 2015 when 76ers were still purposely losing. That's NEVER produced a title. Not even eventually.
All relative. NYK have a lot of work to do; so do 76ers. 4 years of losing &amp; they have 1 All-star talent who is a physical trainwreck. Meh. https://t.co/eK13GcTkOQ
Not sure what's more criminal - LeBron's off-balanced 3 up 1 or Indy not prepared for PG to be doubled. #INDvsCLE

The Ws' inability/disinterest in executing a play down the stretch tonight is/was alarming. But not exactly new.
KD, Steph &amp; Klay on the floor and the only guy who can hit a clutch shot is Draymond, who just fouled out.
How can you not like these Grizzlies? A blue-collar beauty to their game and giving the Ws all they can handle.

Hawks beat Spurs after 11 straight losses, thanks to 29 off bench from Tim Hardaway Jr. And they said in NY he couldn't play in this league.
Speaking of TimHardaway Jr, reports out of NY were he couldn't play. Proving otherwise in Atlanta. Line tonight: 11-13,  28 pts, 6-7 on 3s.
Not the center of the sports universe right now but a fun one at Phillips Arena: ATL's TH Jr 3 ties w/3.3 seconds, Kawhi J rims out. OT.

In answer to the question: No doubt. To which I have to add: Wow. https://t.co/tOU9mu5sz2
Two compelling matchups and then 3 WTFs. Celtics-Knicks &amp; Ws-Cavs were all I needed. Family &amp; football take over from here.
I've criticized LeBron for not having a go-to spot or shot. Same can be said for KD. Shot selection down stretch not good. Nor a first.
I was about to say "If KD can check KLove 1v1 in the post, that's a problem for the Cavs." But if RJeff can dunk on KD, make it even-steven.
Feels as if Cavs are fighting to keep a lid on the game while the Warriors are fighting to keep a lid on their emotions.

Last on Klay's 60 pter: He told KD he should've had 70. KD &amp; Steph to Klay: You missed at least three "butt-naked" 3s and should've had 80.
Klay subbed out w/60. In 29 minutes. Crowd subs itself out as well.
Klay, 57. 3:23 left in 3Q. Crowd chanting "Klay, Klay, Klay!"
As if Klay weren't hot enough, Monta Ellis giving him FTs. Klay's got 54 in 3Q. What's the chance Ellis said, "F--- it, fam, let me help"?
Ws feeling themselves. Steph passes on a breakaway layup to toss ball 15' in the air for a trailing KD to crush. Up 91-60, 7:30 left in 3Q.

The Step-Over &amp; Reaction that Changed the NBA: If Draymond isn't suspended, Ws win title in 5. If Ws win title, KD doesn't leave OKC. Or...

That was 5 years ago. God forbid anyone has a goal, doesn't reach it &amp; decides to try another approach. https://t.co/aRy8BhUM7U
Disagree. Character is making a decision you believe is right, knowing it will be unpopular, and doing it anyway. https://t.co/sThJoKNjD8
My point is this: KD made a career choice. We don't know what inspired it. To crush his character simply for the decision is cartoonish.
Forget that Iggy was Finals MVP, i.e., arguably indispensable piece. Either it's ignoble to join a team that beat you or it isn't.
So it's not the principle of the move but how good you are. Where's the line, so we can crush fairly: All Star? MVP? Starter? #GTFOH
Funny, I can't recall Iguodala being crushed for leaving DEN for GSW - you know, after losing to them. Exactly how many standards are there?
One more for now: Compared to how LeBron left Cle &amp; Mia, KD's exit was ______ https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV
Because I'd like to know what the prevailing opinion is: The best remedy for KD joining the Warriors is _________ https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV
Except they're not. The NBA never has been more popular. Or profitable. KD on the Ws will drive even more interest. https://t.co/MzCKzzr9Se
FWIW: My issue w/LeBron was never that he left for MIA. It was how: the charade of dancing w/5 other teams &amp; blind-siding the Cavs.
Irony: this KD-fostered lament - the NBA is broken because its best talent can choose where it works - began on Independence Day.

Now that you've had time to let it sink in: You ______ Kevin Durant for choosing the Warriors https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV
Nothing like Pro Athlete-on-Pro Athlete crime. https://t.co/czVxG0lPcD
So the Clips go to the trouble of wooing KD, then forfeit any shot at him by keeping ARivers &amp; still are w/out a true P&amp;R back-up PG. Hmm.
I love the intangibles Al Horford brings. I just don't see how his are the ones that the Celtics need to get out of the 1st round.
NBA PGs can't be thrilled about facing @elfrid, who was already a pretty good defensive PG, with Ibaka &amp; Biyombo behind him.
Can't wait, after all this lavish spending, to hear NBA owners 'splain how they need the next CBA to keep them from spending lavishly.

Truly happy for the people of Cleveland.  #NBAFinals
Festus Ezeli back in the game. I'm not kidding.
Trying to think of a player who has had 8 more painful minutes in Finals' history than Festus Ezeli just now. I've got nothing.
Festus Ezeli back on the floor to start second half.
This is the essence of debatable: Most impactful player in 1H not named LeBron or Draymond was ______ https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV #NBAFinals
Most unlikely development of the first half is easily ______ https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
If I'm LeBron and on the floor with Mo Williams, Tristan, RJ and Iman in a G7, I'm looking at Tyronn and at least thinking: "Really?"
I expected Game 7 to be special but I never dreamed it might feature a big-man battle between Kevin Love &amp; Anderson Varejao.
Steph's claim he must play the best game of his career doesn't equate with being stripped at midcourt by Richard Jefferson.
The relief in the building when Harrison Barnes hit that first 3 was palpable. So is the angst now that he's missed the next four.
Iguodala did not start but is taking off his warm-ups now. Appears to  be checking in for Ezeli.
Your take: Having a lead after the first quarter of Game 7 is most important to ___ https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV #NBAFinals
The Warrior role player who absolutely has to make a G7 impact is https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV #NBAFinals
For those offended I ask your take on topics via link &amp; Twitter: solution on the way. Won't be ready until after Finals. In the meantime...
What say you: Win or lose, if LeBron has another game like 5 &amp; 6, he's Finals MVP? https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV #NBAFinals
W/the belief quad-nickels mean more than triple-doubles: LeBron was 1 steal short of a quad-nickel in G6 &amp; 2 blocks short of a quint-nickel.
We, as NBA fans, are lucky. One way or another, something historic awaits: validation of 73-win team or epic comeback &amp; title for Cleveland.
@TheRyanHollins, pressed for a G7 prediction on @BR_Radio, believes Cavs make history. Sees LeBron living in paint again, Ws' w/no answer.
There's plenty to laud LeBron for - as I have - including the last 2 games. I just believe in context. Character flaw, I suppose.
Is that why they let Ezeli &amp; Mo &amp; Varejao switch to guard him in G5 above the key? https://t.co/a4HpAEE0Qb
I said he was great. He is great. I said he was not like a specific group of greats. For specific reasons. https://t.co/mCDzbUYlnR
No one ever dared MJ, Kobe, Kareem, Magic, Bird et al to do that. They didn't dare. And that's what separates LeBron from them for me.
It's the worst-kept secret, demonstrated again 2night: teams dare LeBron to beat them as a scorer. Sometimes he makes them pay. Sometimes.
So we're going to rave about LeBron's domination but ignore that a guy who couldn't jump/move guarded him. Got it. https://t.co/qwNQnrIso1
They never once mentioned Iguodala, with a bad back, was guarding LeBron 1 v 1. It was almost as if the Ws... https://t.co/jb73BzUy26
Curious decision by Ws to guard LeBron with a bad-backed Iguodala as much as they did, no? And by the broadcast crew not to note it.
I don't get anything for clicks. I like the app &amp; aggregating results. You're free to ignore/unfollow. All good. https://t.co/NrKHhVGXTt
To be clear: NBA view is Steph's act is different than Udonis Haslem's in '06. UD threw at an official. Steph accidentally hit a fan.
It's not reporting. It's a poll. With options for you to express what you think should/will happen. Because I care. https://t.co/L5mFz6igS8
He threw it at an official (Joey Crawford). Intentional aggressive acts toward a ref (or a fan) are different. https://t.co/fXlPd9E83C
Unofficial word I'm getting from NBA source is that throwing a mouthguard warrants a fine, not a suspension. On to G7.
Tyronn Lue had that magic touch tonight. Just about everything he tried worked.
Steph hitting a fan w/his mouthguard warrants a suspension https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals

Breath-taking, heart-breaking work. Last three words of title as important as the first one. #OJMadeInAmerica
Bogut reportedly made trip to CLE. FWIW: He travelled to every road game of the Clippers' series w/a cracked rib. Didn't play a minute.
Should've said it sooner: thanks for taking part in my polls. Enjoy seeing what you think. Link allows me to aggregate topics/results.
Cavs &amp; Ws have both won a physical game, sooooo...If the officiating continues to allow physical play, that favors https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV
They discussed Kevin's defensive posture on a play. He showed what he did, LeBron showed what he should've done. https://t.co/jIzQbP2vEC
Late to this, but I'm amazed anyone would think Kevin Love was looking for a high 5 from LeBron last night. Clearly not what transpired.
Whatever happens from here, the Cavs have redeemed themselves https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
The performance of _______ has hurt the Warriors the most https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
The pucker factor in the building is rising. Kyrie unaffected. Feels as if Ws can contain him, they have a chance. Not sure they can.
For anyone who doubted Draymond's value to both the Ws' D &amp; O, this game should erase it. And, no, the sample size isn't too small.
Hack-a-Tristan feels like a desperation move by Warriors. Cavs' lobs and layups vs. Ws' contested 3s means a Game 6.
Pace, style and score of first half are a good omen for https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
The defense hasn't been stellar but the shooting display has been impressive regardless. Kyrie, Klay, Steph, LeBron -- all locked.
LeBron's shaky start can be attributed to https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
I've always wanted to see impact if a crowd villainizing a player, rather than boo, went dead silent when he's introduced/touches the ball.
Survey time: For Warriors to win without Draymond, a key contributor has to be https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals

Title-Contending Warriors of Today a Reflection of Past Teammates and Coaches https://t.co/MJNXn4p9gK via @bleacherreport
Lot o' layers to this, but here's one: If LeBron purposely goaded Draymond into his suspension, he is https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
Draymond Green's suspension means https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
In hindsight, that last one came off more lame/corny than I expected. Going to put myself in a Twitter timeout.
What makes the Ws' D so suffocating when they're on: they're all Alec Baldwins in Glengarry Glen Ross, i.e., They Always Be Closing.
Don't know the Ws' D plan, Kyrie v. LeBron, but no one is "allowed" to go 1v1. Kyrie attacks as soon as he sees space. LeBron? Sometimes.
If anybody drives on single coverage &amp; there isn't help, that's simply bad defense. Watch a shell drill sometime. https://t.co/pmCwwBC8JD
And since we're at it: Warriors Finals MVP after four games is https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
Let's flip the MVP talk. If you had to pick one for the Cavs after 4 games it would be https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV #NBAFinals
And to that end: a psych chapter also could be written on NBA players who recognize LeBron's greatness yet aren't afraid to disrespect him.
Not to belabor this, but Joakim Noah also called LeBron a b*tch in 2015 playoffs. Not new, curious that LeBron would act as if it is.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...or a wily vet sent packing. Not to be overlooked in G4: Varejao's 4-min (3 rebs, 2 pts) gut punch.
As for the word Draymond said to LeBron, my $ is on "b*tch." It's his go-to. Same word Shawn Marion spit at LeBron in the 2011 Finals.
Exactly. Yet never tried to take over. Yet this is Finals #7. Every sentence about LeBron could start with "Yet..." https://t.co/5Wu2y8tIAD
Hasn't it been said of every HC LeBron has had outside of Miami, whose system he didn't always exactly embrace? https://t.co/V7vbp3AiZT
There's a psych chapter on LeBron waiting to be written. How can he be that good &amp; accomplish so much yet dial it back on nights like this?
Last one for the night (thank you for weighing in): LeBron James' near triple-double in Game 4 was https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
I'd say I want to hear why the Cavs shot layups rather than 3s in the final minute, but that would be a lie -- that's a white flag move.
Instigator in LeBron &amp; Draymond dust-up was https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
I would expect the Ws to out-execute the Cavs in a close game, but the Cle offensive rebounding widens their margin of error. By a lot.
The Cav the Warriors have no answer for in Game 4 is https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
Most worrisome development for the Cavs is https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals

The best way to describe Game 2 for the Cavs is https://t.co/bpIVfNTMhV  #NBAFinals
Must be why Curry has a team-high four fouls, played 20 minutes due to foul trouble &amp; has taken 0 free throws. https://t.co/mnm0WBhtIq
And for whatever it's worth, Cavs fans weren't claiming the cast as being inferior before this series started. https://t.co/bwz0LNt1dC
Guess I should've added a qualifier: If I ask a question about LeBron, the answer isn't someone/something else. https://t.co/bwz0LNt1dC
For what it's worth: I'm 100% behind Lue's decision to play Richard Jefferson more. Or, as I'm thinking of him at the moment, Hodor.
I ask because I truly would like an answer: How does a player as smart &amp; gifted as LeBron take a long 2 ISOed on Barbosa w/Ws surging?
"Uncontested" is as subjective as anything else, but if true, allowing 20 vs. 9 is stunning. And damning. #NBAFinals https://t.co/oAE33gCqgh

Cameras didn't catch it &amp; don't know if commentators did, but Kerr barked at Klay after that last 3. Easier shots to be had via the offense.

Those suggesting I delete the original tweet: nah. I own my mistakes. I made one. Based on the reaction, most never have. Cool.
Confirmation from Ws: they played the original "Under Pressure." No cover/theft/whatevs. Point of original tweet stands. Thanks for playing.
My bad: hearing it through a wall. Sounded like Ice. Assumed he did a cover. Again, glad I gave you all reason to crow. Good for the soul.
Glad I could foment more outrage and insult on Twitter. God knows, on the scale of egregious acts, I clearly did something unconscionable.
So it's my fault they're playing Vanilla Ice's remix? Or tweets now have to have a bibliography? SMDH.
Warriors practicing right now with Vanilla Ice's "Under Pressure" blaring. The kind of subtle joke that has come to define them.

This looks like the basketball version of Benjamin Button. https://t.co/E43cJpiq3l
I'm on a Twitter jag -- apologies. But did Charles really just make a Matt Dillon/Gunsmoke reference?
Meanwhile, complaining about Ws' moving picks has become Twitter-beef-du-jour. Truth: they do no more &amp; arguably less (due to O) than most.
@Money23Green back in but clearly gutting it out. Would do Ws good to close out, get conditioning for Steph &amp; rest for Draymond.
Reeeeeally interested to see if Draymond Green comes back into this game and how he looks when he does. Gimped his way to end of 3Q.
The push-an-opponent-into-your-driving-teammate to create a foul is the trick-the-ref strategy du jour.
Pre-tipoff award ceremony: I love that the fans can share the moment &amp; the MVP gets to bask in it. I hate its potential impact on the game.
When the game/life is not fair: DeRozan snakes pass for Lowry, gets fouled. Winslow, a rookie G playing C, chastised for missing rotation.
Luol Deng out (wrist). Now DeRozan (thumb). Proposal: let Mia/Tor be like Night's Watch/Wildlings &amp; join forces to face Cavs/White Walkers

Thank you, Tina. For those who might've missed it... https://t.co/RhC6ESnIUq
Not my intention. Just find it hard to believe that, first time ever, 125 voters independently drew same conclusion. https://t.co/nuO4asAGy1
I don't see voters making unworthy picks because no one will know. I do see them playing it safe because people do.  https://t.co/kqRzX4h9Jc
You haven't seen the game played or officiated the way it is today, either. https://t.co/K0IuJBgKDd
Number of 3s made determines MVP -- is that a serious statement? https://t.co/b9Yy7Rqmvk
Was MJ the unanimous choice the year the Bulls won 72? No. Penny, Hakeem &amp; Karl all received 1st place votes. https://t.co/O3fZ1GeU6J
Don't interpret that as a knock on Steph's worthiness. I voted for him. Just hard to see him as the most clear-cut dominant MVP of all time.
Why I think Steph was 1st unanimous MVP: social media/vote transparency has voters afraid. Good reporters don't like being the story.
I don't get TMac's take (Steph as unanimous MVP reflects less NBA talent) unless he's saying Steph is far-and-away the best. Which he isn't.
Is this the same NBPA that created an award last year that didn't recognize @StephenCurry30 as MVP? https://t.co/Wr4tpzUC5F
Here's a clip of the aforementioned 'splanation. https://t.co/ssTPQLW6JJ
Just wondering: if Steph's unanimous MVP selection came after he didn't play &amp; Ws won, would the reaction have been the same?
@ATolliver44 explained why KD isn't the missing piece for POR on my @BR_radio show. (I agree.) Interview OnDemand via the @SiriusXM app.
Or the next coming. I didn't say it would be easy to find that one piece. Then again, he WAS a second-round pick... https://t.co/5oepjMBn9f
Imagine the Blazers with one more piece. Lillard vs. Curry. Moda vs. Oracle. For the next, say, five years. Oh, yes, please and thank you.
Worth noting: Steph's OT heroics don't happen without @Money23Green's smothering D against all comers for 48 minutes.
No words. #StephCurry

You must be new to this, too. I've been to every arena, often in the same year. (Boston crowds are up there.) https://t.co/BhtN5VEwg9
You must be new to this. They've always been here. As a former beat writer ('92-97), I can assure you of that. https://t.co/g5dgPREhpK
Oracle crowd truly one-of-a-kind. No hint of dissatisfaction w/slow start. Got loud behind every surge. Went full-boat bananas down stretch.
The conundrum the Ws present: take out your pressure-release big (Plumlee) and now you're playing small. No one does that better than Ws.
Game is getting big. No one's ability to grow with it is being tested more than Mason Plumlee's.
Kerr goes w/we're-getting-back-into-this-with-stops-not-scores philosophy to open 4Q. Turns tide. If Ws pull this out, credit crowd as well.
This just in: @Dame_Lillard has made several quality defensive stops tonight. If he adds that to his game [insert "shudder" emoji.]
Not sure what you could see on TV, but nice battle heating up between Harkless &amp; Klay. Mo was in Klay's ear non-stop after he drew the T.
You're seeing why I felt compelled to put @money23green on my MVP ballot (5th), even with a teammate (Riley Curry's dad) at the top of it.
Despite buzz around the league about Dwane Casey's tenuous job security, sources close to the situation insist Raps' FO values him.

Don't tease like that. Everyone in the Bay Area wants Wake of the Week back. https://t.co/zlDdWEUJQx
Hou scrubs in except for Dwight, who has played 42+ minutes. Needs 2 pts for double-double. Season high if he plays last 3 1/2 minutes.
Tube tops. Parachute pants. Pet rocks. Bring em all back, if you must, but please not The Wave. (Ws' fans just did one to amuse themselves.)
It's a 30-point game. Both Bickerstaff &amp; Kerr are standing, JB barking directions, Kerr complaining about no calls. Fellas...
@Money23Green proves once again he's the Ws' compass. Sloppy 3Q start, Dray hits boards hard, pushes ball up, Klay et al get going.
I wanted to set it at 12. Talked out of it. https://t.co/V2Dzvd6kS3
Trying to amuse ourselves on press row by setting over/under on times JB Bickerstaff wonders, "What the f---" tonight. Line set at 6.

Has Blake Griffin Played His Final Game for the Los Angeles Clippers? https://t.co/MulOK904G4 via @bleacherreport
Do your homework. 73 Ws. Reg season: 2-1 w/out him. Playoffs, 1-1 when he didn't play, 2-0 when he couldn't finish. https://t.co/h38SLS50le
If they just get out of this round I'll gladly say their roster depth is better than I rated it. https://t.co/2MEVnNwNPh
By the way, for LAC fans saying their team would've been fine w/Blake: haven't you seen how he's played or team's tepid react to his injury?
And for anyone who wants to point to the highest payroll, the Cavs, being the same: don't love their roster, either, but CP3 isn't LeBron.
FWIW: I've long admired LAC fans cuz they've endured so much. But the NBA's 2nd-highest payroll shouldn't be all about 1 guy. And it is.
This isn't about championship caliber. It's about getting out of the 1st rd against no-experience overachievers. https://t.co/FiBuxMFIEJ
Great comparison. Bulls' roster the last few years has been consistently overrated as well.    https://t.co/KrIvRCbG7j
No, I stopped expecting them to get out of the first round when CP3 went down. That's the point.  https://t.co/QZZoNFSbWX
They didn''t just miss KD. Steven Adams led the team w/70 games. They were a MASH unit. And missed by 1 game. https://t.co/USTv3UCxCN
Nah. GS, OKC, CLE, SA, TOR, ATL &amp; MIA all would have a chance to get out of 1st rd w/out their best player. https://t.co/y8fL3j1IEe
Don't need an All-Star. Need a decent PG. Or a way to play well enough to get out of the 1st rd. Blake or no Blake. https://t.co/vY9srcRgFc
Clippers have had bad luck, for sure. But let's be real: a team crippled by losing 1 player (CP3) isn't bad luck. It's bad roster building.
Kind of you. Bay is still lucky: 2 quality sports stations. Of course, you CAN catch me 7-10a on @SIRIUSXM Ch 83. https://t.co/I0tVUWouf7
Only real source you need: Ws' history. He coached them to their 1st consecutive playoff appearances &amp; 50-win season in 20 years.
My timeline is suddenly filled with experts who want to tell me what sources say Mark Jackson did &amp; didn't do. Save it. I was there.
You've got the wrong guy. I wasn't on KNBR. Never railed about hiring Kerr. Said Mark was done wrong. As he was. https://t.co/cs5vGlj8q9

Good news/bad news on Steph Curry. Good: has Grade 1 MCL sprain. Bad: will miss 2 weeks, then reevaluated. Have to win next rd w/out him.
Nah. I just happen to be engaging today. If I need Twitter validation, I'm in trouble. 'Preciate the compliment.   https://t.co/aDIBRKA265
Thanks to growth of his mid-range &amp; finishing game, doesn't need 'em as he once did. CP3 needs them more than ever. https://t.co/iK3mdolbkW

Avery Bradley, often working w/out a shotblocker, slow bigs &amp; an undersized G next to him is pretty damn impressive. https://t.co/TgUSybeela
Essential if you don't know what makes for good team or individual D by simply watching. Or knowing what to watch. https://t.co/sr6K9f20f6
Let's get it straight: CP3 is a great PG. He's far &amp; away LAC's best player. But he gets by on guile &amp; team help more than ever before.
Thank you. Because as we both know, steals are one of the most misleading stats when it comes to good defense. https://t.co/GCjasOXZff
I specifically said 1v1 for a reason. But the separation is not as great as advertised. CP3's D is vastly overrated. https://t.co/hFU265FAuF
Completely wrong, thanks to the limitations on physicality and hand checking. But thanks for sharing your thoughts. https://t.co/qrKZl40QVl
Or the guy who watched Lillard go by CP3 at will w/out one until they went to trapping him at midcourt. https://t.co/nw0dp7u6y7
By the way &amp; not that anyone asked: 1v1, give me Damian Lillard, aka Baby Hooper, over CP3, Dad Hooper. All day, every day.
With tickets going for 3 bills+, fans want the trimmings. Or teams want them to feel better about spending 3 bills. https://t.co/upX44CcUdy
Announcers chose an odd time to tout CP3's MVPness. At the time, he needed a double team to stop Lillard  &amp; a pick to get open.

If you missed the @byrnes22 &amp; @JJRedick interviews, worth catching on replay now or OnDemand @br_radio. Promise.
Zach LaVine has taken the shine completely off those playbacks of Dr J &amp; MJ (and Bones Barry) taking off from the free-throw line.
Zach LaVine is a dunking prodigy but Aaron Gordon is making this fun.
Not mad at Shaq. Both Zach &amp; Aaron missed on the first try. Neither deserved more than one 9, but 49s seem right.
Dr J back in the day did all of his dunks consecutively. Dunk, retrieve the ball, dunk, etc. https://t.co/8sjPaF9g9f
Why Steph cracked up when Draymond whispered in his ear, post-contest: Green told him, "I picked Klay to win."

Since you asked: you start by reading the related tweets. Orrrr you ignore them and say something condescending. https://t.co/Jqtc6j315H
At least one person got it. Kind of. So there's that... https://t.co/37PwoZz1nG
@JeremyAbramson Agreed. Sarcasm rarely plays well in 140 characters.
Best advice I've received today. Done. https://t.co/9nGhR2qbzQ
Precious intellectual debate here. It's sports. On Twitter. Involving some who think culture is voodoo. https://t.co/QveZHgBQlP
Right. So why does drafting a top 5 pick = title, when those top 5s didn't win for the teams that drafted them? https://t.co/uGMOtk59Sk
Dead wrong. Losing due to circumstances (injuries, turmoil, relocation) doesn't send message it's OK to lose.  https://t.co/S74TuIps0l
FWIW: I know both probability &amp; analytics aren't exact. Especially in basketball. Tell that to Sixers' fans trying to convince me they are.
Sure did. One time. There's a freakin' difference.  https://t.co/8Li7c5xz0v
Neither was with the team that drafted them (well, Kidd came back after other stops) and were complimentary pieces. https://t.co/kaEYteud7H
And that would be the Spurs. Whose dedication to culture and chemistry is unparalleled.  https://t.co/HuuejPquUH
Find where I said there was. My point: Probability doesn't operate in a vacuum in the NBA. Losing has consequences. https://t.co/OL42AF4Iuy
Shouldn't we also look at how many teams featured No. 1 picks - Philly's goal - and didn't win? https://t.co/zuJuV7iKpg
I thought analytics &amp; probability were supposed to be exact sciences. Sounds like a lot of ifs and maybes. https://t.co/RsWm8ao2UC
A case can also be made that you don't need a top 5 pick. Did the Ws? The Mavs? They've both won titles recently. https://t.co/NsDFgkxtFp
And my point is that's only one piece of the puzzle and the one a GM has the least control over.  https://t.co/NsDFgkxtFp
Tell that to the San Antonio Spurs. And the New England Patriots. And the San Francisco Giants. https://t.co/z0zVmI16Kn
OKC tanked one year. Sixers, 3 and counting. Embiid/no Embiid they were lotto-bound w/out a PG this year. #Facts https://t.co/2WD3fkTKuX

That's a convo, not a tweet. Building via the draft is great but there's more to do. Not seeing that "more" in Phi. https://t.co/DWmbiQHGFm
No comparison. Abrupt franchise move cost them, not willfully losing. And they invested in quality "mercenary vets." https://t.co/V4ygOJndZ0
@TC_09 @PhilaPhans As I'll guess you'll willfully ignore the impact "mercenary vets" JJack &amp; JO'Neal had on who/what Steph et al are now.
Hard to do in a tweet but: Build a culture/org that = an edge in FA. Scout/draft well. Be patient. Get lucky.  https://t.co/2SnUEIfp5c
Clearly worked for the early '90s Mavs, early '00s Bulls, Clips forever. I know, I know: they didn't trust the... https://t.co/TKM7uOn90M
As for building a roster replete with young players: blind leading the blind logic. As Sixers have shown. https://t.co/meM0kYIyHN
Not every vet is a mercenary. That's what a good GM does - finds vets to help, not stunt, his young talent.   https://t.co/meM0kYIyHN
I see what you mean. Clearly that mercenary Ish has really screwed up your team. And pursuit of the worst record. https://t.co/K8AvcaHE1Y
Logic on par w/the viral Family Feud clip. Another word for mommy: "Mom-MY." Another word for losing: "Rebuild-ING." https://t.co/K8Avcaq3aq
In a Toronto Starbucks. Some sort of promo with manager giving bio sketch of Howard Schultz. Have yet to hear words "Thunder" or "Sonics."
Since we're on the subject: saw Embiid working out the other day. Looked a little heavy but yoked and had a nice touch on his jump hook.
Nobody is hating on the Sixers. I hate the theory that purposely losing for years is shrewd vs. reckless. https://t.co/gEc9lb3uLX
It develops bad habits and wastes any chance of real assessment of ability. That's a fact.  https://t.co/gP533GKfIp
I AM glad the Sixers/Jah are getting to compete. The idea that playing a lot in blowouts promotes growth is absurd. https://t.co/pLJZav1wTC
Or that the Sixers already have conceded their "Process" was flawed. In deed if not word by bringing in Jerry C. https://t.co/pLJZav1wTC
That IS funny. Considering they didn't go head to head, Jah was a -10, Boogie was a +14 &amp; 76ers' blew a 17-pt lead. https://t.co/pLJZav1wTC
Obviously great. 'Zingis already has evolved more than any 76er thanks to playing on a more competitive team. https://t.co/v5cNJY52aC

@caseybannerman Seems as if you've taken over both sides of the conversation now. Probably for the best. Do your thing.
@caseybannerman I'll repeat: I said what I said the way I said it for a reason. I never said they'd never beaten the Cavs. For a reason.
@OSeb1 @BleacherReport Fouls away from the ball are routine. You want them all to be Ts? Refs don't -- can't -- officiate intent.
@caseybannerman And that Tor 4-point win in Nov? It was at home vs. a Cavs team w/out Mozgov, Dellavedova &amp; Kyrie. That enough research?
@caseybannerman "We"? You work for the team? Raps lost last time they played Cle &amp; Chi. I said what I said the way I said it for a reason.

Spurs invested more in offseason (DWest, Aldridge) to negate impact of Draymond than Steph. To no effect. Beastly beyond the boxscore.
Firing your HC w/out even discussing it with your best player is more dysfunctional than your best player demanding the HC be fired.
On my @SiriusXMNBA show, 3-5pm PT: Sean Elliott to preview Ws-Spurs, Dwane Casey to explain Raps' surge &amp; BJ Armstrong on coach killing.
Not sure how else to read "We have to get in shape" from a team whose coach just got fired than "We didn't give him everything we had."

Frank Brickowski played against the '95-96 Bulls and has worked w/the country's top HS players. How does he view Steph/GSW? On @SiriusXMNBA.

Meanwhile, Beans Bucher (back right), rolling with his crew. https://t.co/rZcZ3LSgeY
Let's see if Steph attempts a crossover stepback 3. Indicator of how much calf is bothering him.
Just making the case on press row that Draymond Green is the Ws' most indispensable player. Case study now with Steph in locker room (calf).
The Warriors' small lineup being able to switch everyone on D and run their O til they find the ideal mismatch feels both old &amp; new school.

FWIW: Harbaugh's QB touch isn't why the 49ers' suck. Kaep grades out nearly same as last year. No Willis/Borland/Cowboy is more like it.

@taylorclark2585 @steventurous Short of Rubio having a no-trade, nothing prevents Minn from moving him. Hope you can get your 5 min back.
@steventurous Simple: he's a year younger, hasn't been a pro since he was 15 &amp; has two good ACLs. Flip inherited Rubio. Makes a difference.
@taylorclark2585 @steventurous problem: I didn't write, I did a video. So you criticized a take you never saw or heard. Talk about lazy.

For those asking: Steph isn't undersized height-wise but majority of star-caliber PGs either are taller, have 20 pounds on him or both.
Question, what with the Finals MVP vote: is this proof you CAN win a title with an undersized PG as your best player or nah?
Benefit of Klay being off &amp; Steph not winning Finals MVP: plenty of motivation for Splash Bros. to keep grinding. #moremountains

@acrnobrnja3 @bsarow10 @mavsfansforlife You remember incorrectly. I never had LeBron or Bosh going to Chicago.
Good Lord what a @SIRIUSXMNBA show today: Cavs GM David Griffin, @srdavidwesley4, @datrillstak5 &amp; Kent Bazemore. 5-7pm ET. Sirius207XM86.
And for what it's worth: I love competitors like Delly. Tough, gutsy. He was a +. Just not co-signing he shut down Curry when he didn't.
Dellavedova and #NBAFinals2015 convo will continue on my @SIRIUSXMNBA show, 5-7pm ET, w/Kent Bazemore &amp; Stephen Jackson as guests.
@norcalvol Many singled out Klay for having a good game. Again, because of the no.s. He was chief culprit in shooting too quick too often.
Update: Steph gets ball on broken play w/5 seconds on shot clock in corner. Has to jack up quick 3. JVG raves about Delly's D. Okeydoke.
@skiswm Phil Taylor of SI brought that up on my @BR_Radio show this morning. Hasn't shot the same since the fall. Fair to consider.
@norcalvol Cavs deserved it. Attacked more. Ws quick-shot it too much. Let a short Cavs rotation off the hook/playing D deep into the clock.
Apologies for letting the actual game get in the way of a storyline manufactured from No.s for those who have no idea what they're watching.
Re-watching G2: 3 P&amp;Rs, 3Xs Curry loses Dellavedova. Misses open floater/open 3/passes. Then misses layup after losing him on off-ball cut.

Agree completely w/JVG that shooters should have to respect verticality, too. But to be fair, LeBron got same call as Steph now earlier.
Credit Dellavedova - continues to take the floater. If Ws trap LeBron that hard &amp; leave no one else, he can't shrink from taking that shot.

Now if anyone wants to lavish praise on Mozgov for thoroughly outplaying Bogut, I'm with you.
Not sure about this slobbering over Delly D. ISOed in a corner he's been OK. P&amp;Rs he looks lost. Give Steph space he puts him on skates.
Admirable that the Cavs are hanging tough; but they're doing so w/7 vs. Ws' squad playing 10. Has to take a toll eventually.

Forget this contest - Zach LaVine, in two dunks, is challenging for greatest ever.
Crowd was like, "Oh yeah, Plumlee's still in this."
Has to be seriously distracting for 3-pt shooters to hear Kenny Smith and Reggie Miller critiquing their shooting *while* they're shooting.
@patbev21 somehow found a way to play defense in the Skills Challenge. Got in JTeague's way on dribble, then caught up and beat him.

@Mospeights16 is a NBA journeyman big. So says his resum√©. Don't tell him that. Plays with a star's confidence/mindset.
Russ Westbrook's return: goes to bench after perfect blend of patience/aggression and even complimented a ref. OKC 25, NYK 8.
Last chance at holiday bonus: Retweet this &amp; follow @Molhimawk for a shot at a $300 Visa gift card. Winner selected today at 6 pm PT.
I'd share if you were here. Swear. Hope you had your own slice of goodness. http://t.co/LevoJapByz
Molhimawk Street and I want to make your Black Friday special. Retweet this &amp; follow @Molhimawk for a shot at a $300 Visa gift card.

Addendum to my Rec League remark: few NBA journeymen better suited to excel in this kind of game than Randy Foye.
Hard to discern how much better the Cavs are playing because the Nugs are playing Rec League. Perfect style for the Cavs right now.
Not Darrell Arthur's rep but no play in hoops is more dangerous than what he just did to Dion Waiters.
@br_radio: Does LeBron need to grab the reins or let the rest of the #Cavs work out their early struggles? Tweet or call 844-BR-Radio!
LeBron finding out how it feels: teams are exploiting the Cavs the exact same way the Heat once did everyone - running it down their throat.
