state/local elections, esp this year have long term effects. Everything does not reset every 2/4 years with elections. Congressional maps are redrawn every decade &amp; will be in 2020. Who is in office when it happens will effect election fairness until 2030 https://t.co/G4w2jYd7bP
Your vote matters. The energy around this election has been inspiring, but don’t get complacent thinking everyone else has got this. It may seem inconvenient, it may feel inconsequential. But it fucking matters. Please care, please vote.😊 https://t.co/EHJPLAmUYB https://t.co/WrxYTi06k9

The issue is more about education, so patients fully understand what they are taking and why, the treatment plan, and the risk of abuse if not followed properly. As well as access to treatment/rehab/DR./Counselors that can help administer these treatments correctly and safely.
The idea of trading one pharmaceutical addiction for another is a genuine concern. But the answer to that issue should never be to abandon or disregard research or treatments that can be effective if administered properly.
It's easy to criticize any treatment that isn't totally effective. But the reality is that no addiction treatment will prove to be wholly effective for anyone and everyone.
It was incredibly helpful for me. That doesn't mean it would be the same for everyone. Part of what I learned, and we are all learning, is that unfortunately there is no one size fits all solution to addiction. It's complicated.
I used Suboxone, and Naltrexone at different times in my recovery under direction of a Dr. and at a rehab where they would dispense proper dosage at proper time, and eventually wean off. In conjunction with therapy and education. https://t.co/LVRpRzP2o4

That takes courage, and respect. I hope he finds help, and peace. And I hope he knows the power that his choice to be open about this has.
My thoughts are with John Skipper, as well as his family and friends. Addiction affects every personal relationship you have. And that's what this is for anyone, deeply personal. But, his position gave him a platform, and he didn't shy away from using it..
It's things like this that speak to that point. Addiction does not discriminate. Showing a 20yr old kid with a face tattoo next to a 61yr old corporate president might seem odd in any other instance, but in terms of addictions potential, it's reality. https://t.co/qIhJM82R9g
The openness in which we talk about addiction in pop culture, in private, and amongst ourselves has been trending upward. Which is positive, but that broad brush stigma is still firmly in place for a lot of people, and any step to help change that should be taken..
that's a worthy message. But, I don't think it helps the stigma that addicts are just the "bad kids" grown up. I hesitate to critique too much, because the reality is that ads like these being online/tv at all is a step in the right direction from 15yrs ago and prior..
I've gone back and forth on this. The choice of casting the "face" of addiction in so many substance abuse ads. These worn down kids in their early 20s. The clothes, tattoos, piercings, etc. Does it help show how many young people's lives get stopped in their tracks? Maybe, and..
