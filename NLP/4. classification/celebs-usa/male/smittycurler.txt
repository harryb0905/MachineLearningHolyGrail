@12thEndSports never seen this before. Should I try the bite technique? #askTESN https://t.co/U6ihTyF9mN
@12thEndSports who is getting fired for this camera malfunction?#Interestingperspective
@notthefakeSVP one teams actions are not a representation of our sport. The athletes, teams, coaches, and true fans of the game have a clear understanding of that. When the media shares negative stories it overshadows everyone that is doing things the right way. #YESweareathletes
Curling just made sportscenter!! NOT for the right reason. Years of athletes trying to prove that the drinking portion of curling is for the recreational players. I feel like we just took a giant step backwards. https://t.co/08YYavNOFZ
He‚Äôs baaaaaaaaack. @drose #Twolves 28-5-5
Tiggerrrrrrrrr
@TigerWoods is killing it! I feel like I‚Äôm a teenager again watching him extend the lead. #birdietrain
Live curling on https://t.co/yJTqZAoAV0 a huge league game. Come watch! Blaine or Four Seasons Curling Club!!
@chrisplys @TheMike720 @_jennamartin15 I‚Äôm more of a Velcro guy. https://t.co/thh9oHT5A6
@HollywoodCurl I‚Äôm thinking that since it‚Äôs my first time at the Spiel I should probably bring my ‚ÄúA‚Äù game and go for the win! Bid on me if you want to join me!!
@monwalkcurl @12thEndSports Hahahaha there‚Äôs the homeless comment! I was waiting for it!
@12thEndSports missing being in the booth with you guys!! Hopefully I can join you this weekend! @monwalkcurl keep my seat warm! #ready #usacurling
Hey @usacurl I think we need to get @MrT out to try some Curling! #curlingiscoolfool #olympics
@MrT I agree!! #coachMrT
@ChrisLongKSTP I liked the one they had on SportsCenter. ‚ÄúHail Milly‚Äù named for the old lady who the Vikings invited to the game.
Even being a Vikings fan. Much respect to @Babymagik32 for the class interview he gave after the game. #newfan
@PriceAtkinson So sick!! I‚Äôm still amped! #skol

@12thEndSports @tgeorge1323 and I are in a battle for top Vice Skip stats of the week. Can we get a real time final stat count for us on the bench?
One week until we start the Olympic Trials!! Let‚Äôs go! ü•åü•åü•å#usacurling #olympics
@TeamShuster Im going to feel bad too. As the great @LaZyIkE_14 likes to quote: "It's so hard playing against friends."

@usacurl Craig, I really appreciate you answering my questions today. Just one more, how do you manage the stress of being a celebrity?
@usacurl Craig, what kind of mental preparation are you doing leading up to the Olympic Trials?
@usacurl Craig, why do you look so angry out on the sheet of ice? Is it frustration having to watch @seanbeighton throw a rock?
@usacurl Craig, does your team have any mascots?
@ShowtimeTate curling end zone celebration? My next curling make I'm picking the rock up and spiking it. #goldentatetoolympics #curling

Things didn't go the way we would have hoped, but a huge thank you to @BroomsUpCurling for supporting us all season long. @monwalkcurl

@timandsid maybe your new favorite team should be from the states!! @curlteambrown
@GarciaaLater thanks for the ride tonight. Nothing but class service. @Uber
@JacksPizza not sure I needed this many labels in my one frozen pizza. 15 of them? https://t.co/neZ4PMtElO
@chrisplys @curlingcraig I wouldn't show that angle. All it shows is that you haven't won anything since 2008. #iwasgoodinjuniorstoo
2-0 to start the event! Play again at 4:15 EST. #shorty #curling
@tsimo23 who hits that anyway?
Up extremely early getting ready to fly to event #2. Hoping for a big weekend. #curling #shorty #notnamedafterCraigBrown

Woww. @KDTrey5 to the Warriors? Add a top 5 player to the team with the best record? I see why the nba commish wanted to gradually raise cap

So is @russwest44 trying to dress like Milli or Vanilli tonight? #girlyouknowitstrue https://t.co/Leap1rEygg
@kdropkin @occurling @Sarahndippityy end of June.
@occurling @Sarahndippityy @kdropkin should we play Sarah and Korey?
Turn the basketball game on for the final 3 seconds and see a half court shot to tie the game and send it to overtime.  Wow!!
@chrisplys all star lead? I would guess not from the record. @Shoostie2010 I feel your pain. #welcometomyworld
@runinrock @usacurl @JaredZezel04 I think we should ask for an opening game rematch next year. What do you think? #hibbing #shotsfiredback
@chrisplys  wish I was there to watch you play lead. Love the jersey by the way. #ridingcoattails  @Shoostie2010 @MattJamilton @tgeorge1323
@JoelLamp @C_Fussell @CoachPhill he would probably come out of retirement to play with this group.
@JoelLamp @C_Fussell absolutely!! We can be on the same team!
This is something that I will remember for the rest of my life and share with my kids and grandkids. Thank you @kobebryant. #whywelovesports
We want 60!!! #kobe
There it is!!!! 51!!!!
@chrisplys @kobebryant it will take 70 shots to get to 50 points. #letthemfly
Now we just need @kobebryant to get to 50!!
@AmandaKessel8 I like hockey and all, but this is the night of basketball! #kobe #Warriors
400!!!! Wow!!
For such a big night don't you think the @Lakers could have brought in a big voiced singer to sing the National Anthem???
@Timberwolves No defensive rotations. No fluidity in the offense because of lack of motion. Most importantly, no emotion. #coachneeded
Kris Jenkins just put his name forever in the books. What a fantastic game!
@runinrock Zez will carry us of course. Haha
League Champions!! What a fun season we had! https://t.co/GlEiyB3lxB

@qevenson you're doing fantastic job in the booth. @joepolo and team Fenson are listening in. @chrisplys wants a shout out.
@verified would you please follow @chrisplys and verify him. He is angry that everyone is verified other than him. #helpstopthewhining
@chrisplys @joepolo1 don't worry. 20D is wonderful back here. Zzzzzzz

@alispagnola 1 word 2 syllables. TIN-DER!! #swipingforloveorherpes
My choice was to either go watch 50 shades of Grey or watch #2015Nats ... glad I chose curling!!
Going to see @mnwild  play Carolina tonight!! Anyone else going??

@chrisplys the ocean is a bit of a drive, but the Gulf is close. Will that do? Maybe I could post one of those polar plunge videos.
@jclong I read that today! Sounds like his wife is trying to hide the money from his kids.
@chrisplys haha good point. I better cheer for a Florida team.
I guess I can watch the Minnesota Wild hockey game. Not really a hockey fan but have to support the home state team!
@Shoostie2010 look at your buddy posing as he comes up short. @_n_m_e http://t.co/N7rrzvmhle
@chrisplys I haven't watched 1 second of any of the games and turned it on about 15 minutes ago. Saw 2 goals. TNT has a better game on.
@_n_m_e you better have yourself a bowl of @wheaties so you can feed your confused mind. PS: I'm already on my way there. Hurry up.
@_n_m_e &lt;--- dreamer
@_n_m_e I'm thinking it's going to be a good day out there today. Well, minus the large numbers on your scorecard!
@littl_noah @Shoostie2010 @LaZyIkE_14 nope. I goodwilled it last year. Someone else needed to enjoy the magic.
@littl_noah @Shoostie2010 @LaZyIkE_14 that's a pretty nice jacket you have on Noah. You still have it?
@chrisplys haha i did not watch the game but it's because I'm on the golf course. #lifeistough

2 weeks until Vegas!! Definitely cannot wait. #superpumped #blackjack
Glad it's the weekend!! Time to rest and relax.
TGIF! I am ready for the weekend! Nothing planned, just ready for it haha.
Are you kidding me?  Fire alarm at 6 am!!
Last day of the week before 4 more days off. I think I will sleep all 4 days away!
@Shoostie2010 leave your winter jacket at home. 70's and 80's here. See ya tomorrow!
@AprilMaroshick haha will do. Thank you for the concern.
@AprilMaroshick for fun! Kidding, work stuff late.
@AprilMaroshick nope, driving. In fog.
@AprilMaroshick join the club! I'm feeling the same way.
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!
@NKOTBFLSOLDR yes
@John_Wall Get that leg healthy and get back to the court!
@cmknight16 so nice I will say it twice. Damn new phone.
@cmknight16 haha thank you. I am not, but it is still nice to hear!
@cmknight16 haha thank you. I am not but it is nice to hear.
Got the new iPhone today, I think I am liking it so far. Trying to think of ridiculous things to ask Siri. Any suggestions?
@ObliviousNFLRef t'wolves!!!
I am glad it is Friday. Little golf and a lot of relaxing going on tomorrow.
@derrickcasper or you are just old. #oldtimerscurlingleaguehereicome
In Georgia!!!! 688 miles to go!!
Tennessee!!
Just crossed over the Ohio River. Hello Kentucky!!
After losing our toll ticket on I70 and having an embarrassing moment at the toll booth, we are finally in Missouri!!
Yep.... Still in Kansas. Does it ever end? http://t.co/4wDOXgCe
On the road. Somewhere in Kansas. Scenery hasn't changed in hours!! 27 hours of driving to go.
And the road trip begins!!! Loveland, CO to Ft Myers, FL!! nothing but Lexi, myself, and the open road!
Helping Lexi finish packing her things and tomorrow night is the start of our 30 hour road trip to Ft Myers!!
@derrickcasper @jeffisaacson I told you guys to stop shaving your private parts together on the road. #reasonswhyyougetpicks#razorburnforu2
@NKOTBFLSOLDR haha yes I did. I need a maid for here.
A little under 2 weeks until Lexi moves to Ft Myers!! I can't wait!
@AprilMaroshick jealous of the golf or the nice weather? Lol I moved away from the cold. I had enough of it.
Another beautiful day in Florida. Time for some golf with @_n_m_e
Nice and relaxed sitting by the pool. Come join me! Haha http://t.co/JdCrahYg
I think everyone should follow @ObliviousNFLRef very funny due to the current NFL refs situation.
@AprilMaroshick randomly ran into your broadcast yesterday.  Listened for a few minutes and figured It deserved a following on twitter lol
@Beach_Girl_DGD well I know you are a bit older than I am, but we still had it when I was in kindergarten. :)
Is it nap time yet? I am exhausted! #reasonswhyimisskindergarten
@mlamere33 their next learn to curl session is September 19th. 845pm-11pm. Panthers curling club. After that date their are not any listed.
I was kind of hoping for some better storms from Hurricane Isaac. Ft Myers only got a little rain and some wind. Maybe next time.
Help some of my former teammates raise enough finances for their continued training. http://t.co/f1cIL9Vn
What a crazy week. I could have used a sleeping in day.
5 1/2 hours until Lexi arrives in Fort Myers!! Can't wait to spend a long weekend with her at The Breakers.
This whole Penn State thing is an outrage.  I believe it was the players who won the game. Not the coaching staff. Why take games away?#sick
Thank god its Friday. I am ready to sleep in late tomorrow, followed by a round of golf.
@Shoostie2010 I think your friend @_n_m_e is going to need to take out a loan after how bad I beat him yesterday. #istripledigitsgoodingolf?
I definitely need to go to the gym. I am a little out of shape!
Waiting for my flight back to Florida at the Atlanta Airport.  C terminal is crazy!!
At the Atlanta airport waiting for my next flight. I can't wait to see Lexi in Denver!!
If anyone needs me, I will be laying by the pool! http://t.co/3vBeZm1a
@terry_usacurl I actually sent out the National Guard looking for you because of the 3 day absence. Thankfully you are ok!!
Anyone around the ft myers area that wants to golf with me tomorrow?? 12:18 Haha
@jeffisaacson Congratulations, you should upload a new picture in order to celebrate the big day! #willsendgoldpaintforrefurbishing
@StephenCurry30 gotta be Harrison Barnes!
The rain is crazy here in Ft Myers! I had to drive through 2 feet of water this morning!
What's with all the rain recently? I need it to dry up so I can golf! #waitingforthesun
All this rain is going to make it tough for me to get out and play golf. Damn you mother nature!
@jeffisaacson you don't write, call, or even send singing telegrams to me. Just want to make sure the priz is doing well. #amazingawaits
@JaredZezel04 I've got a $100 that says @TigerWoods is in the top 10 and he beats J Duff.
@Shoostie2010 @jeffisaacson $1500 sounds fair. I don't know if I am ready for all that power though.  #amazingawaits http://t.co/Nw4MjgAf
@ChevyCustCare I'm thinking new, but a year old model may work if the price is right.
I am thinking of buying a new car. Any suggestions? Camaro?
3 days until my trip to Colorado!! Much needed vacation.
A sad day in the curling world. Elizabeth Busche left everyone far too early. My deepest sympathy goes out to her family.
@mlamere33 I'm thinking I should come up and golf your course again this weekend. Wanna play?
Sorry that's draw something. Smittycurler is the username!

@VernonDavis85 look at you retweeting everyone. HahaHow about one of your 5 favorite curlers (me) getting a retweet. Great run this season!
@chrisplys that only would happen if you and your friends were kissing it.  Playing in the last chance if you dont win in philly?
@mlamere33 thanks again for allowing @Shoostie2010 and myself to play at your course. I will definitely be back.
Hahahahahaha. Immature people make me laugh.
