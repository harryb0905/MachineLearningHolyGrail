Question for you TwitterVerse? Imagine what $50k would do for our own @is_foundation sanctuary!!?!? Can you?! #Vote #UpgradeYourWorldUSA
@NoahsArkClub Should be: why are tigers attractions at gas stations in Louisiana?Why are more tigers in captivity than in the wild?
@NoahsArkClub for picking up the pieces where humanity fails these beautiful creatures.Their habitat is rapidly being destroyed.The question
@NoahsArkClub thank you for taking such Greta care of these animals. There is NO REASON what so ever to have captive exotic animals. Thanks
