Lemme clarify a rumor: we are not looking for a new singer, and if it were to happen organically, I’d be open. Seems pretty clear, yet I guess some folks have a hard time understanding.  I’m not into predicting the future. The future will happen.  Stop making shit up.
"Prove You Wrong" &amp; "What The Words Meant" will be available across all streaming platforms this Friday https://t.co/0el9olOTVY
Social media has been wasting my time and making me angry for too long, so I’ve cut out a lot of it for the time being. A few minutes a day is enough. I’m much happier. 😃  Have a nice night.

proper usage https://t.co/o5RntLVb9d
I think this works, too. Because here, it’s a noun. https://t.co/rQjhucFHt0
You can even use it as a negative, as in “I was disappointed in the painting’s aesthetic shortcomings.” I know “aesthetic” can also be a noun, as in, “I love this artist’s aesthetic.” But never “this is so aesthetic.” (3/3)
because I’ve heard people call something “aesthetic” meaning “cool looking.” That’s the wrong usage, right? When it’s an adjective, I think it has to be followed by the thing it is describing. (2/3)
English experts, help me clarify: the word “aesthetic,” when an adjective, has to be used in connection with the thing it is describing, right? Only “She was admiring the painting’s aesthetic beauty” but never “the art was very aesthetic.” I ask... (1/3) https://t.co/vUfOnmmJVv

You were right, teacher was wrong. They might want to look up any number of examples on the web, from Psychology Today, news pieces like the LA and NY Times, and this—specifically aimed at educators: https://t.co/mGFVHKiOYt https://t.co/c2xyzsvvXs
The reason for the word choice is not for the deceased, it’s for those still with us, the ones reading. Our words can be triggers. They can be land mines for some people. Words matter. Taking care with them is an act of love—and shows emotional and intellectual intelligence. https://t.co/LVevHd47gg

I made a sock puppet video because it took me months to feel like I deserved to have fun.  So I celebrated it, and I have no regrets. I wanted to make you guys smile.  You deserve to smile. You deserve to have fun. You deserve to live.  THINK before you click.  🙏🏽
Not clicking:  -spares you from the negative imagery and ideation -lowers the amount of traffic on the link or tweet (and their ad $, in some cases).  Celebrate the life. But realize attention is currency, both literal and figurative.   Most importantly, take care of yourself.
Suicide contagion is real. We can’t simply count on journalists to “not write” or “write more responsibly.” Yes, they should. But we cant just point the blame at them. Our responsibility is to think before we click. And consider unfollowing.  https://t.co/ZvAdIpN3ub
When you are dealing with depression / hopelessness, do me a favor. Avoid clicking on things that perpetuate that feeling.  Doing so isn’t disrespectful to the people we’ve lost. It is an acknowledgment that their pain was real. Fight against that pain. Don’t click.  #Bourdain

Question. When an article calls my show a “tribute,” does that make it sound somber / sad? I felt like the show had a range of emotions. Your thoughts?

What is the best SASSY TWEET warning?
Anyone: I politely disagree with Mike. Fans: https://t.co/2hYK0iaEY1
I need a “sass” emoji to let you know when I’m being sarcastic or whatever, and when I’m not (I was not attacking Perez at all).  You guys are too protective of me.  It’s very nice.  Unnecessary, but very nice.  😂
We all work with what we’re given, right Perez? 😉 I sing / rap / write from the heart and from the gut. And even for better singers than me, the “technical” execution takes a back seat to the honesty and inspiration in a song. https://t.co/ZcrIARpKYu

@smithoxx Nope, just finishing breakfast before I get in the studio.
@ttimhds Or: what if you were the parent of one of those athletes? Your kid, age 8, days: “Dad, I want to start competitive curling.”
@ttimhds I was thinking about curling: wouldn’t it be so weird if people were this interested in curling year-round? Like, not just for a few weeks every four years (or whatever the actual numbers are)?
@Misterninetysix Same. Heartbreaking and infuriating. Too much “thoughts and prayers” bullshit.
@linkinparknglot I cannot.
@phoenixlp glad to hear it, Dave.
What are you thinking about
How are we doing this morning. Let’s talk.
What are your favorite moments of me and @phoenixlp from LPTV / other shenanigans?
“@chloekimsnow tweeting about being hangry in between gold medal performances” is the new bar for greatness.

in case you were wondering, i’m MikeShinodaLive on Snapchat.
“Happy Birthday Mike, someone hacked your Instagram account” 😂
The real question is, if the show only has 5 people attending, how many of them are LP Underground members? 😂
1) The promoter generally chooses a venue based on perceived demand. If the venue’s too big, everyone loses. 2) There are expenses (crew, freight, production, etc) that need to be paid for in order to do a tour. 3) Don’t sass me. https://t.co/XGCfmumRBG
smart. https://t.co/t8ksTKW7vR
Please don’t vote more than once. Get other fans to vote!  If 5 people in Russia vote a bajillion times and I show up to a stadium with 5 people in it, that would not be good 😂 We need real votes by real people who want to see a show! https://t.co/tT4AaRuvjV
If you've already voted, follow the #PostTraumaticTour coverage on @LPLive's timeline. Moscow just bumped SaoPaulo out of the #1 spot, and Tel Aviv just jumped into the top 5. #ShinodaOlympics LOL

Ask your friends for me. I need a video someone took in person, of the Getty Center / Skirball Fire. #FireVideoForMike 🔥🙏🏽
Friends in LA: can anyone give me a live video YOU SHOT (and own) of the Skirball fire? Must be a vid of the fire, not of a TV / news / etc (they own that footage). I want to use it for something I’m making. Use #FireVideoForMike to show me.
Watch the videos from #PostTraumatic: https://t.co/I5qT99LaqN
I love you guys.
OK, I'm gonna jump over to Instagram, and do an Instagram live chat / recap.  Meet me over there.
No, its overall activity.  Combination of everywhere you listen to music.  But the more active you all are (in whatever your favorite place to listen to music or watch videos), the more likely it is I can come play.  You gotta share, retweet, repost, and be active. https://t.co/3tNnjp11FF
In terms of where I play shows: it's up to you. Share, tweet at / call your music stations (radio/video/etc.), &amp; make noise. Tell them you want to hear #PostTraumatic. If the agents &amp; promoters know the fans want a show, it'll happen. But you have to make yourself heard. https://t.co/cvbPC83O4r

Thank you to @AppleMusic - stream #PostTraumatic EP here: https://t.co/mxYEQzGrK3 🍏❤️🙏🏽
I feel like I’ve been starting from a standstill; that any momentum or forward movement is entirely a result of your sharing / positive feedback. I wish I could thank each of you, every time you do it.  #PostTraumatic #PostTraumaticEP https://t.co/mHvyjLaLVo
Thank you @YouTube https://t.co/1lDxmmkAI5
Good idea.  Lemme check on this. https://t.co/dNyenxDeyJ
I made the music / track of “Place To Start” while we were working on the OML album.  Rob did brushes and crashes on it back then. https://t.co/my2iqr61DC
This literally made me LOL https://t.co/w8OPmXj6iX
Double reference: Purple Haze (1) via  “How High” (2) by @therealredman and @methodman - https://t.co/uuk0EWLKjp https://t.co/lngnUaWJjd
That’s a great goal Annie.  We’ll get there together 🙏🏽❤️ #PostTraumatic https://t.co/5IChc9Hy27
No, that was me (channeling my inner Chester, maybe) ❤️ https://t.co/i3avy4R2Ad
And by the way THANK YOU all for continuing to share the songs and videos! https://t.co/1KpzXYz1Kc
Oh, I’m not bothered by the mistakes—those things are gonna happen. I just wanted to clear them up for the record. 🙏🏽👍🏽❤️ https://t.co/DJb4MK3zbI
Agreed—watching it now, I definitely was in a different frame of mind!  I hope I’m more coherent these days, HA https://t.co/LTRfDTpNac
fact edit (2/2) a minor correction (that only really matters to me and a couple people), my friend’s family didn’t have to go out of state.  But they DID have to change locations a lot of times because of the fire!  😬🔥
fact edit (1/2) At the end of the “Watching As I Fall” I said it was coming up on 4 months since CB had passed. I misspoke; it had been 4+ months and was coming up on 5. 😁  https://t.co/X8FdeVzopL

Favorite #PostTraumaticEP #PostTraumatic track?
ICYMI, this was the conversation we had this AM about the new music #PostTraumatic #PostTraumaticEP  https://t.co/RCj8hgUWS1
I’m gonna take off for now. And again: I’d love to have our conversations here on social media, one on one. That goes for fans and journalists.  And again, thank you so much for the support.  Spread the word.  #PostTraumatic #PostTraumaticEP #MakeChesterProud
That’s a great idea  #PostTraumatic https://t.co/8lMYxau3Aw
I have every intention on continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it’ll take time. https://t.co/nXLxTSd40J
Grief is so personal, and I thought that a D.I.Y., autobiographical format made the most sense. So I shot &amp; edited everything in the videos myself. I‘m planning to continue doing it this way until it doesn’t feel right anymore, or until the work becomes too much. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/n3CQRbpHqw
There are lots of artists I’m friends with, and artists I don’t know who I admire. If I invite anyone to be a part of this process, it’ll have to be based on a mutual understanding of the concept—they have to have lived it to speak / sing / rap / paint on it. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/dOGnIi4w81
(2/2) And I wanted to put this out as soon as possible because I’m living it, and a lot of other people are living it, too. I want people to see and hear it as soon as I complete each thing.  #PostTraumatic
(1/2) On this project, I’m trying to work “in the moment.” I record a vocal or shoot a video while I’m feeling something. For example, I wrote and recorded verse one of “over again” on the day of the Bowl show, and did verse two the day after.  #PostTraumatic
My friend said the videos are “cinema verite.” Shot in a way that doesn’t obscure the fact that they’re real life. The music is that way too. The car horn was audible on the mic when I was trying to record, which was super annoying. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/ylpJGlcrts
It still exists, I just want to figure out the right presentation! I made a version of it with lots of cool sounds, but that seemed to take away from the power of the song. Maybe I restart with piano only...? https://t.co/G8pSGL5gYh
I have a bunch of songs; some are more finished than others. I wanted to release these three today and see what the fans want me to do next. If you like these, I’ll keep going. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/pzARTLCCA3
Of course. Please play them, share them, retweet, etc. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/r96XfZqwYd
It was a marathon. The longest set LP usually played was about 90 minutes. That show was 3 hours long.  #PostTraumatic https://t.co/tmMf4XlFz2
There are live instruments, of course. Guitar, percussion, piano, etc. I also feel like sometimes keyboard instruments sound better if I play them by hand instead of recoding and quantizing them (a fancy way of saying the computer plays them). https://t.co/UEhelLhMmP
Yes.  I’m not ready right now, though. Still making more music and visuals. https://t.co/7ha4YMSzGx
I have a wonderful support system of friends and family. I think I had visitors every day for the first two months. They brought food and just listened, which was great. https://t.co/MF6WkjayGC
The hardest thing was just getting started in general. The only person I spent more time with than CB was my wife (honorable mention to Brad and Dave).  Getting back into the studio was terrifying. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/L8NU1B5zvf
You may @ me, bro
First things first. I want to talk to you directly, I don’t want anyone in between.  So I’m not doing interviews for the time being, just using social media. If anyone (including journalists) has a question, you can ask me here in the coming weeks. #PostTraumatic
I am so grateful for the friendship and support by Dave, Brad, Rob, and Joe.  Love you guys. #PostTraumatic https://t.co/i7vW756kWc
Thank you T. All my love to you and the kiddos! https://t.co/8XrAaxGzFN

I did a listening party on Instagram Live today for the new album. I left early, and didn’t really give a reason. To be honest, it was because it’s hard for me to listen to Chester’s voice for that long. I‘m fine, I just wanted you to know. Thanks for understanding. 🙏🏽❤️

The photos you took on vacation 3 years ago are nice 😂 but show me that you took a photo just for #OneMoreLight 🌅
Who's gonna do an LP day at work or school? Paint your car for #onemorelight? Put up posters? Get creative, and I'll repost you.
If you're taking pics for that #OneMoreLight campaign, don't forget to show off an LP logo!  T shirts, stickers, paint, etc!

1-Thanks for the intelligent discussion, all perspectives, on my timeline today so far. 2-I'm going back to work. Studio update coming soon.
@njamesfox And YES, a studio update--in 360--is on the way!
@njamesfox 👍🏽 It needs to be a discussion! More listening and problem solving. Too much is at stake.
@StarClimber Differs by state.
@njamesfox Fair enough, then let the law be specific.
@riciapants Laws differ by state, and that's a reasonable procedure in Texas, I think.
@riciapants Sorry, I disagree. It's a lethal weapon, not a pair of used jeans.
@hyeabud "Hard" doesn't mean "Don't make it a law."
@Lee_Myers_  OK but that's a different conversation. My family was interned in the US, 1942, so I'm happy to talk about that. Another time.
@Moubayed11 I don't live in FL, but I believe you. Laws differ by state; people are calling for a federal rule.
Some ppl saying "they have BGCs". No background check if you buy a gun online, via gun show, or some private sales. Shouldn't be exceptions.
@njamesfox I agree, that's a non-sequitur to me. "Diagnosed Mentally Ill" = no buy, would be better, but isn't as catchy 😬
@KPIN14 Congress can't do that. But they can create a safer system.
@the0nlykey Not always. No background check if you buy a gun online, via gun show, or some private sales. Fed should specify "always."
Congress, please 1.) require a background check to obtain a gun, 2.) block suspected terrorists from buying a gun. https://t.co/qCSKm4zEAh

Excited to see the 1st #XVLP design out there in the world. Thank you to @BAPEOFFICIAL for coming thru w the design

When someone shares something sad, or I read something I disagree with, I want to give it a thumbs down. I'm all for the dislike button.
Kids already bully in the meanest ways imaginable. A thumbs-down is not going to even register on their radar.
Facebook's new dislike button: if you think it's going to "encourage bullying," then you probably don't know much about bullying.

@coetranquilao yo mama
Q&amp;A?
OK guys, we're done!  Thanks for all the love on #TheHuntingParty
The fill that ends the song was an improvisation.  I didn't know Rob could play that fast, ha
Brad's solo and Rob's drums at the end of LINE IN THE SAND are one of the best moments on #TheHuntingParty
MOSH PIT
LINE IN THE SAND is one of my favorite #TheHuntingParty songs. It feels like it does everything that LP does, in one song.
There are lots of different guitar tones and amp setups on this song, giving each part its own flavor, and holding attention over 6 minutes
It didn't work back then. But when I was working on this song, I sang the vocal and it (finally) fit.#TheHuntingParty
The opening vocal part on A LINE IN THE SAND was written years ago, while we were making A THOUSAND SUNS #TheHuntingParty
Rob saved this song, too. The original beat I wrote was more complicated but had no soul. Rob improvised this drum groove &amp; it felt perfect.
Final Masquerade was one of the last songs finished for the album. The original vocal was me singing all the way thru. CB sounds better!
Tom's writing style is alien to us, ha. Very "jam" oriented, while ours is more "writing into the computer."
Tom @tmorello came through to hang/write. The conversation and experience was the best part. We included this jam as a reminder of the day
Chester &amp; I usually do all the lyrics on the albums, but Brad helped too on  #TheHuntingParty
We also set up a really unique kit for this song. In particular: we balanced a couple tambourines upright on Rob's snare, with duct tape.
We recorded all the drums on the album to tape instead of computer. I think you can really hear it on this song.
"Mark The Graves" was one of the earliest demos on the album. At one point, I wanted it to be the 1st song on the album. #TheHuntingParty
One thing I love in "Rebellion" is the cheekiness/sarcasm in the lyrics. We usually have a hard time pulling this off, but it worked here.
We've run into those guys many times over the years. Daron joined me in the studio and brought the guitar riffs that became "Rebellion"
Trivia: our first show EVER was opening for @systemofadown
REBELLLIIOOOON!
There were more trap elements in the album at one point, but we thought they ended up being silly, except this UIG interlude
As a parent, your child won't grow into their potential until they leave the nest. You don't know what you've got until it's (your're) gone
Although it can be about regret (the usual meaning of "don't know what you've got until it's gone"), UIG has an alternate meaning
The structure of "Until It's Gone" is based on building to a DROP; got the idea when working on "A Light That Never Comes" w/ @steveaoki
I think that was the first time we ever did that on a song.
The last chorus in "Wastelands" completely changes chord structure (it's not the same as the rest of the song).
Actually...just the 1st verse. The 2nd verse, on the other hand, got re-written during the final month of recording. #TheHuntingParty
My verses in "Wastelands" were written before the music ever existed. Just words on my computer. #TheHuntingParty
Rob recorded the drums to "war" in one take
There was an alternate version where he said 1-2-1-2-F*CKYOU
If you listen carefully, Chester actually says "1, 2...1-2-THANK YOU"
"WAR" was a demo that Chester brought in. Very little changed between the demo version and the final. #TheHuntingParty
"The Summoning" was a sonic experiment that we added late in the process, to give the listener's ear a palette cleanser before "WAR"
GATS was one of the early demos that helped define the direction of the album. #TheHuntingParty
The album began with a series of demos that were more electro/indie/alt. Then I realized I didn't want that.
HOW REAL COULD REAL BE
To me, Rakim's verse is the perfect mix of technicality, content, and emotional expression. #TheHuntingParty
Rakim is one of my favorite rappers of all time. His verse here is a perfect example of why. #TheHuntingParty
.@ask_brittany The artwork was a collaboration between @JamesJeanArt, us, and Ghost @gtmvfx #TheHuntingParty
@lyricalhobbit Absolutely
Guilty All The Same was the first song on #TheHuntingParty Rob recorded drums for. He worked up to this performance for about a month.
The music behind the interlude before "Guilty All The Same" is an original piece. That's me singing "ohhh"
If you listen, you can hear my vocal mixed with Page's in the chorus
...one of my inspirations while writing #TheHuntingParty
"All For Nothing" features Page Hamilton from the band Helmet. Helmet was one of the bands whose aggressive / melodic sound was...
But we weren't allowed to use it because of legal reasons!
The "I'm not allowed to say certain things" was a clip we put here because we originally had another clip...
That's me saying "Try and do the other thing"--I was talking to Rob when we were recording drums
@_omin0us @LPAssociation Thank you!
@LPAssociation Thanks guys!
The chorus vocal was a stream-of-consciousness vocal (and lyric) by Chester. He didn't write it down, just sang whatever came to mind.
Of all the songs, Keys to The Kingdom was my favorite to open the album because of the constant sonic surprises

And turn on high quality streaming too. This has been a public service announcement.
Turn off the "set same volume for all tracks" on Spotify, iTunes, etc. It fucks up the sound. My Spotify library sounds amazing suddenly.
@lplive it just took me like 57.5 seconds to figure out what HTEP meant.
@lplive But it was never performed front to back; we had 60 minute headline set times, and less than 40 minutes of album music, ha!
Just had a weird thing in Spotify; had to turn off "set same volume for all tracks" b/c Final Masquerade sounded quiet. Anyone else?
OK I'll figure out an "official" time and we should all do it. More to come!

The Hunting Party does not sound like a HT prequel. It was inspired by music we listened to before we became a band.

“@totesoro: @mikeshinoda you should use this cute little guy as your #LPGoat https://t.co/2wXYCzWwNQ” This one is GOOD, almost there...
OK guys, this is a great start.  This goat is saying "baa." I need a goat that screams. http://t.co/f1rhFwe6O4
@HOPTMAH WHAT DOES THE GOAT SAY
@Minecraftiac136 yes.
@EvoOba Record me a goat scream and I might put it on our album.
Linkin Park featuring #LPGoat.
"@BANANA_MADNESS how much time you give us?" M: as much time as it takes to get a recording of the #LPGoat
https://t.co/BqoZYLyCkq
Don't even try to just use a goat scream from some place online. It has to be a clip with you in it, saying that it's the #LPGoat
Post an audio clip or video clip of your #LPGoat screaming and I might include it on our album.  I'm not kidding.
Who has the LP goat?  Use the hashtag #LPGoat so I can find you.
I don't want to just use some random goat, it has to be the goat of an LP fan.
I need someone to record a live goat who screams like this: https://t.co/2O1mDN7GKD
OK guys. I'm crowd sourcing a potential sound for the album...
Wow @Jmeeks20 !
