I don’t always watch football but when I do.... Tom Brady and Gronk win.
All these cycling clothing companies making sweet jackets and vests but utilizing a single zip pocket on the back... The traditional 3 pockets work better. 🤷🏽‍♂️
People that organize their wallet/purse at the cash register.... 🤬 #justdontdoit
@TheWiscoDisco @LinearSportRT @cswartzz #painangel
Anybody that complains about cobbles stones in a Grand Tour has no real appreciation for the history of the TDF. It’s a real bummer some professional bike racers can’t “drive” so well.
This years tour coverage is great, so many documented “nature breaks “ 😂
Good days at the WORS Cup aboard my @RideCannondale FSI https://t.co/ktcnMSCgNe
Imagine if everybody in the checkout line paid with cash... we wouldn’t have to stand in a line of 5 people for 10 minutes.
Good times at the Borah epic. Gotta love a good rip through the northwoods on a fresh @RideCannondale FSI sporting the Lefty Ocho #ridecannondale https://t.co/csJWU1JSE3
@GeoffKabush will you please address the current trend of mountain bikers grabbing fork crowns to be “aero” or how about using Dropper posts in just about every turn 🤣 https://t.co/7wVyJGBRLN
Ohio is a great place- said nobody ever. I hope Lebron loses.
Not really into fast cars, but fast bikes are another story. Love the way this build finished up. @RideCannondale @YourFSA @visionmy https://t.co/Rrtl3lwAWb
@TheWiscoDisco @chloewoodruff Crit tactics! Good ol sneak attack half lap to go works everytime when executed to perfection.
Ok, I’m tuned in. Time to watch the giro! #dontcallitacomeback

Nothing like 3 hour naps post race. Ok where’s the Margaritas, we can finally celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
‘Tis the night before #marathonnats and I’m still awake... 🙄
Boonen should of kept his mouth shut 😂
I must say, that @oakley logo on the race numbers in @Paris_Roubaix is some good marketing.
Supercross? More like scootercross 🤷🏽‍♂️#sxlive
Something tells me Tom Boonen needs some attention. Im guessing the race track isn’t listening to him.
Fell off the wagon, let’s try this power stuff again. @YourFSA @power2max  #shareyourfsa https://t.co/m8ht6U6jcO
@huffyusa @yotwells Now days pros “work from home” it’s so they can take calls from their remote offices. Duh 😆
On my ride today I was thinking about the Belgian classics, and how the racing has went... Basically everybody has marked Sagan and forgot about Quickstep. Why haven’t other teams realized they’re doing it wrong?
All these guys racing for podium spots is sad. Nobody will chase but will attack for a podium spot. If you don’t win it really doesn’t matter. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Terpstra needs to wait for Trek Dude .... smh
Nibali, Sagan, Kristoff. In that order.
Just trying to navigate this coffee shop without tripping on these stupid computer charging cords... like go do your work at WORK, or go do your homework at HOME. Gahhhh
What kind of winning move was that? 😂 and I was second guessing that Quickstep had 1 out of 5. Never mind nobody wants to follow that guy. 🤷🏽‍♂️
How awesome would it be if Valverde won #DwarsDoorVlaanderen ?!
@RevoSchad The part of gravel riding I actually found somewhat fun, would have been better suited to a full suspension mountain bike.
A friend just pointed out, gravel racing / riding is the worse part of road riding, and the worse part of mountain biking combined. Yet people LOVE it. My mind is blown. 🤷🏽‍♂️
For a long time it’s been “dopers suck” but the latest trend seems to be in the direction of “TUE FREE” #amIright ?
EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I go to look at https://t.co/Nugj0tBL97, I start reading the articles and I cringe. I think to my self whyyy did I come back to this terrible race coverage and these terrible race assumptions? Clearly these guys are cat 3 at best.
Ohhhh poor cavendish .... #MilanoSanremo
Perhaps 1X road setups aren’t great for cobble sections? Odd.  🤷🏽‍♂️
When you see a pro tour rider struggle to put is chain back on the big ring.... 🤦🏽‍♂️ #hemusthavebigwatts
4 Am wake up... why do I say yes to shit.
@mariah_watchman Sometimes I wished I had somebody to do things with, then when I do, I remember how nice it is to sit in peace and quiet.
@SheilaKamini Did you drink the water? That might have helped 😂
As pretentious as all these exotic cars seem here in Scottsdale, they always leave plenty of room for cyclists. It’s the Chevy and Ford drivers that are the true assholes.
@TaylerWiles @StradeBianche Anything merino Wool base, with a wind proof shell. Less is more. I’d go merino long sleeve base, with only a rain jacket over it. Don’t forget a visor! Keeps the mud from getting behind your glasses. Rain x lots of rain x on the glasses
It’s 2018, “Stationary” is the newest Cycling discipline, it’s all the RAGE from Jrs, pros, and average joes!  Am I wrong? #TheAntiZwift

They just said “said 15 cars in the lead break away” it’s just like bike racing!!   #Daytona500
Daytona 500! Let’s go racin.
The plus side to St. Louis, it’s not freezing. The down side, riding bikes isn’t easy.

It was just suggested that we use “Uber eats” tomorrow... just because it uses the term “eats” I will not allow myself to do so.

Let’s be honest, today’s CX World Cup was decided by mechanical.
“Gravel” has become more of a status from what I see. Just know I’m going for a bike ride. But if I ride on a gravel road or trail I’ll change it to a gravel ride.
@ironchefmpls It will be the one race I’ll never win! Lol

That moment when everything clicks on a new bike, and the set up just spills speed. 🤤 man I love my @salsacycles Spearfish. #keepertuned
@AdamMyerson Lol well he played dan Martin up the climb...  there's a sucker born every day
Faker. Froome is a faker. It just looked fishy. @PhilLiggett is still being a sucker. 😂 froome is ok Phil.
Froome faking? Trying to get the others to up the pace? #TDF2107
Id be happy with Landa winning the tour.
Was that one of them "attacks" they talk about?
More Gentle men's rules in the parade de France. This is racing boys. No timeouts because you cant stay on the road.
Perhaps hanging on to the bike all the way down saved that AG2R rider some broken bones. #TDF2017
Just saw the @SeaSucker commercial during the #TDF2017 it's a good one
@TheChadhartley Hahaha! Mine was more like 6-700meters to go, from behind. 🤷🏽‍♂️
These tour sprints are boring! Katusha takes control, Edvald goes early, and  Kittle wins. It's a race winning formula #TDF2107
@AdamMyerson It's like 97% of an American crit. 😂
It's been a while since I've arrived home from training and felt like I could eat everything. #mustofbeenagoodday
@AdamMyerson @consult_ant @teamWORS Yeah, a lot of people paid $50, traveled hours to ride one lap of their race because of the cut off time each lap. Just a big cluster.
@AdamMyerson @consult_ant @teamWORS As a "grassroots" race series entry frees were jacked up and time limits were enforced for the lower category riders. Lots of unhappy riders
@AdamMyerson @consult_ant I'm just currently annoyed with how our big USAC @teamWORS went this past weekend.
2 hour spin...  First hour- FML. Second hour- I feel awesome.  It's amazing what a bike ride can do for the mind.
@AdamMyerson @consult_ant I applaud you for that.
Milwaukee traffic is like driving amongst French sprinters.. #canttakeit
@PodiumCafe In that case, might I say bonjour!
Phill liggett says a tie goes to the guy finishing faster? News to me. Just gunna start watching the tour on mute. #makinguprules
@AdamMyerson If the UCI doesn't https://t.co/40imp39VvH
@AdamMyerson Both of them, but Demare is winning in sketchy points so far this tour. Honestly Edvald didn't wanna get sent home so he opened up the fence
@AdamMyerson Better safe than sorry. Unless you're French. Then you better just get on the board. Demare is the sketchiest of all the sprinters.
Demare just making all kinds of janky moves. He's French don't worry they won't even look at that. #TDF2107

@AmourDeVelo @RKilun @toseanandbeyond @Mickeyhavoc Moving a finish straight ? GILA isn't a crit.
@AmourDeVelo @RKilun @toseanandbeyond @Mickeyhavoc Not sure the course has anything to do with that... Maybe it's guys taking risks within the RACE.

So they're saying don't be a one hit wonder?! https://t.co/BNOeK9jh23
@tollakson @DimondBikes I think I need to put one of them to the test... if I can't break it nobody can.
I finally figured out why the mail didn't show up... It's "Columbus Day"! It probably got lost. #IndigenousPeoplesDay
I thought only riders in Wisconsin volunteered... Guess there's some kind of volunteering movement going on. 😆 https://t.co/dwWeilFN0Q
Refilling the tank for tomorrow. @visionmy @YourFSA  #keepdoorcountybeerd https://t.co/32ARsdTx7I
Plastic shoe covers and poorly vented helmets? Bet those didn't help anybody at Team Time Trial WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS #doha2016
Those @visionmy wheels look pretty nice. #fancy https://t.co/Wer2hJSHFt
Never realized how bad dog shit reeks. I now hate dogs. At least cats burry it.
Went to a park, rode my new cross tubulars around, started adjusting tire pressure, what the hell is that smell? Oh it's dog shit on my tire
If you want more braking power, ride a bigger tire.
Stop trying to justify disc brakes on road bikes. No matter what everybody says, most rim brakes are almost overkill.
FYI  @YourFSA and @visionmy always look this good. https://t.co/qw5PTOYwSC
@huffyusa loved your podcast with @philgaimon he does some cool things 👌🏽
@philgaimon on second thought, they didn't waste any money, not even the 10 cents on the cup. 😂
@philgaimon I wonder why USADA targets the guys that aren't even relevant in cycling? Or am I missing something? Sweet they caught a nobody.
@ironchefmpls but I like racing in the mud. Its 50% skill 50% fitness.
Just caught myself watching cross videos... I caught the itch.
Final worsmtb podium of the year. Stoked to finally get a win on the new @salsacycles… https://t.co/M6R4ge19SH
Other than that I had fun. That was just a warning shot. I'll get this game figured out. 😉
First cross race of the year. 1 flat, 1 busted up rear derailleur, why these bikes so fragile? Oh that's right roadies thought of them.
@AMTetrick depends on how much money they actually make. Otherwise the question should be how many times can they quit. 🤔
Second best part of Monday- The very first episode of the Midwest Cycling Podcast is live! Guess who's on it... https://t.co/W4LNBRkjGZ

@The_Mr_Rollins the slump buster
For the record the "September slump" has hit me just about every race season. Bring on October.
First day in a while I finished a ride completely smoked. Finally feeling like I have legs again. September slump 2k16 is ending.

@JoshuaRaspberry keep crushing
Some people really dislike police, but the parking division ruins more days than the police.
I'm pretty sure the United States would give away Florida if anybody would take it.
Words of wisdom- If you happen to take out the trash, it's not done till a new bag is in the trash bin. #dontbelazy

@JessicaJhouse it's not that complicated ... You kick the ball and run. I shall pray for you.

The thought of mountain biking to rock music scares me. But I'm going to take that chance.
Rooming with @ridevalenti and trying to convince him that eating is in fact cheating. Just in case anybody was wondering what I'm doing.

@JamesCBird536 define "well" if it means no broken bones  ya it went well
Everything that could go wrong went wrong
@JessicaJhouse that was my guard.
@huffyusa I wonder when everybody will figure out crits are easier when you roll thru turns without jamming the brakes?!

@philgaimon I just opt to never look down it scares me enough with out that stuff.
@philgaimon if I drank a V8 after dinner does that count as salad?
Watch a movie tonight or brush up on my call of duty skills? These horrible life choices I have to make.
Brewed the correct coffee this morning. Non of this decaf nonsense !

Early morning bike race tomorrow! TT in St Paul. Shouldn't be too much fun, I'd say more painful. #nopainnogain
Negative motivation or positive reinforcement ? I wonder witch one goes further.
I kind of wanna watch this game tonight but I'm not a fan of either team. #NothingExcitingAboutIt

I love going to the local bike shop asking about a specific item and having the manager treat me as if I don't know what I'm talking about
Just washed my training bike. I think that was more taxing then pedaling the damn thing.
