This has been one of my most challenging days alive. Two missed flights coming from Slovenia. Got the one bag I didn't want. Still one more flight then a long drive to Steamboat. It's like he is playing a cruel joke but all I can do is laugh with him.
@JasperGoodNC @casey16larson @redbull Haha that’s funny.

@JBVandeNorth false. Golf is simple you just hit it. There is no wrong shot in a way. Math has so much that doesn't make any sense.

@rappstar @mattlieto it's funny I have the same feeling about @FastBigDog! Anytime someone mentions him, I slam the door and run.
@mikebahn @Deer_Valley @usskiteam I will say they will feel way better on a road bike then a mountain bike. Resistance training?
@jdjarrett1970 @mazidobrovoljc @petosagan @jmjarrett2002 gotcha. Trying to antagonize him into some sprints.
@jdjarrett1970 @mazidobrovoljc @petosagan to bad peter is Slovakian not Slovenian.
@FastBigDog @dcieslowski it's not our fault if you fall in a puddle of mud on our next ski and we get T-shirts made because you can't ski!
@FastBigDog or he is telling you to stop drinking and start training. #sorryimnotsorry
@jdjarrett1970 @DocGordin @dcieslowski @gpoirier1 there is a reason why @FastBigDog has spoke. He is scared to death. A wise man said so!

Almost 3 months on the road and I am one @delta flight away from my own bed. Simple things like cooking and the couch sound amazing!
I was so close to having excellent day. I was a little to aggressive after the takeoff that killed the jump, but I had a hell of a xc race!
Beautiful day in Trondheim! Excited to be competing here again and giving everything I can for the best result! http://t.co/3bR5kRY6yh
Average Day here in Lahti! Decent jump, Decent ski! I can do much better but you can't expect much more than your average! On to the next!
@LahtiSkiGames @USA_NoCo awesome. Kiitos!
@LahtiSkiGames is there a gym that @USA_NoCo could use near the stadium or hotels?
@timjohnsoncx @JameyDriscoll he is getting back in the group! Rather off the front dangling then off the back any day!
Last race tomorrow at @Falun2015! Team sprint on tap and @SkiFletch and I are racing together! Team fletcher for the win! @USA_NoCo
@SkiFletch killed it today. Great jump and great race and he was just off the podium! Congrats on for another fantastic result. @USA_NoCo
I am starting a little far back but anything can happen in a cross country race and there is nothing I can do but ski my heart off!
Missed the takeoff today in the competition. So close has never felt so far! I have made it a long way and you never know what can happen!
Beyond stoked to see @jessdiggs and @CaitlinGregg on the podium! Cheers to our @USSA_Nordic teammates! This is absolutely incredible!
Very happy with my day. Best jump for the week and had a fast race. Now I am stoked for the large hill! @atomic @ONEWAYSport @Teamusana

@FastBigDog what room number is that? I've got a present for you!
@FastBigDog next question. How did you manage to use three pair of underwear? Did you eat some bad sushi?
@FastBigDog who said we were sharing? We are on our way then we can battle.
@taiheikato did you make it to Sapporo? We are stuck in narita! But at least we got sushi!
@airfrance I am a premium member with you guys and why do I keep getting the last row on your MUC-CDG flight? 35f doesn't feel very priority

Happy with my PCR jump today in @ChauxNeuve! Jumping is getting better @USANoco @TeamUSANA @atomic @RudyProjectNA @HoneyStinger @ONEWAYSport
@airfrance why do I keep getting bad seats as a premium member on sky team.
Schonach, Germany http://t.co/HJtnG8I1wz
@WestminsterPR @SkiFletch thanks for allowing us to continue our education while pursuing our dreams!
Sad to hear about the @usskiteam alpine athletes that were caught in the avalanche in soelden! Thoughts and prayers are with their families!
Tough day for sure. Not the jump I was capable of but better than most of the year. Happy to be in the top 30 again and skiing fast @USANoco
10km individual on tap here at the @SchonachWeltcup! Hope to do more skiing than swimming. @USANoco is here to battle!
@Stmbtmom make sure to put some spaces in between words so your messages dontlooklikethis!
NEW YEAR NEW BLOG! http://t.co/I7HO0fiZEG
@JBVandeNorth @skiloomis john I don't know what you see! I think the cold air in PC and all that snow has you confused! Hope all is well!
@BenjaminBerend your girl is on tv!
Happy New Year everyone! Stoked to start the new year off competing in europe! May 2015 bring joy and success to everyone! Also lots of snow
Winter is happening in Müchen! @USANoco is stoked to be back over and ready for the @fisnc WC in Schonach. http://t.co/HJym7vIm07
@SimonDumont06 good work dude! That will feel great in a little while.
A couple @Delta flights to send me off to Europe for the rest of the winter. I hope I can get one last upgrade in 2014 for ATL-MUC! #wishbig
@gpoirier1 Bills beat Patriots, 17-9. New England snaps 35-gm win streak vs AFC at home.  Tom Brady 👎
@SpennySki @BenjaminBerend mess with the bill you get the horns!
@SpennySki @BenjaminBerend it's okay. I caught little Ben listening to Coldplay while tindering, and crying after no matches. #periodprobs
Great day jumping in park city with my @USANoco team. Amazing cold and clear for perfect conditions. Who had fun as I know I did.
Merry Christmas everyone. I'm going to enjoy the nice new snow in park city! Have a great day!
Our team @Usanoco is now on twitter. All the athletes will be posting photos and updates over the whole winter about competitions and such!
@jdjarrett1970 @toddhageman @BillyDemong I know mine is getting there but I can take it from my chest unlike bill
@BillyDemong @jdjarrett1970 @cycleimp @toddhageman short and thin kind of like your hair
@Keegels99 where is this!? I need that!
@cycleimp @jdjarrett1970 @BillyDemong @toddhageman skiing at WP was skiing. Should last for a couple and get better with each storm!
@jdjarrett1970 @cycleimp @BillyDemong @toddhageman Going to give White Pine a try
Any xc skiing in park city between PC or JR? @BillyDemong @toddhageman @jdjarrett1970
Happy to be back in Park City with snow coming down for the holidays, then its back to work at the @fisnc World Cups In Europe and beyond!
Thanks @Delta for helping USA Nordic Combined out! The upgrades keep us refreshed for the next @fisnc World Cup competitions! Big Thanks!
Better day for the team in @ramsaudachstein but we gave it our all in some tricky conditions. 5th place is a good stepping stone! #wecandoit
@OlympianTours @SkiToSea @BillyDemong @SkiFletch I could be game. I'll let you know!
It's a beautiful day in ramsau for the fisnordiccombined World Cup.  Let's go USA @skifletch… http://t.co/LDks8KJOyj
@JasperGoodNC @BayerMartinb099 @BenjaminBerend @skimadden @grandrewski @skiwardo Ben weren't those pants white before?
@FastBigDog @WCGilbertson @BillyDemong @ollie_burruss I believe it was price is right rules, so therefore your...OUT!
@ollie_burruss @FastBigDog @WCGilbertson okay sorry. Let's start here: FBD looks like his donkeys, fat and slow
@FastBigDog @ollie_burruss @WCGilbertson false it can ski with style but more importantly I can cross a cattle guard with style and ease!
@ollie_burruss @FastBigDog he imitates everyone because they are better at everything! @WCGilbertson wore those boots with style!
@BenjaminBerend your girl is winning! And maybe she's trying to wave at you! http://t.co/fPWXnjL96L
Heading to @ramsaudachstein for week of @fisnc comps. Hoping for easy flights on @Delta with flat beds for the SLC-CDG flight.
To spend the miles on @delta for an upgrade, or wait and hope they upgrade me going to the next @fisnc WC In @ramsaudachstein! Tough choice!
@timjohnsoncx @mattlieto why fat bike when cross country skiing is so much better/harder. Trust me it's a good workout for cyclists!
I love midday naps more than Anyone but I felt like I was pretty close to death with how deep I was in sleep! http://t.co/I63lrypoP1
Everyone come out and watch the @FISnc COC these next couple days. Races are at 9 tomorrow fisnordiccombined's photo http://t.co/uXCT614B6L
I guess one benefit of getting up early is to see something like this. Up early for official training… http://t.co/gPsknuGXWa
Jet lag got the best of me last night. Didn't have a chance to get out of my clothes! #pro @BenjaminBerend  photo http://t.co/ttccuDtDps
@LukeBode_ussa  what @SkiFletch and @skiloomis ?
@pegmcshinn @SkiFletch I need to learn how to jump from Bryan!
Ski jumping is one of the most fascinating sports, but also the most frustrating. It tests your abilities to the max mentally and physically
@fisnc:@TFletchernordic and @magnus_krog discussing @taylorswift13 Yes, in @KombinertNorge's new interview! https://t.co/X7HI6SR6PI #fisnoco
@jdjarrett1970 Little @BenjaminBerend just sent me snap chats of Soukalova, declaring his sincere love for her! #shouldntyoubetraining?
Grattis med dagen @annikenaalbu!
@kathykaehler @SodaStreamUSA I love them never enough bottles or canisters. Hope all is well Kathy!
@timjohnsoncx you can also take the boat or ferry. They can be real fun!
Sending out the get well vibes to Noah Hoffman as he took a hard fall in @RukaNordic today. He will be back! @USSA_Nordic
Jumping was cancelled and I got to race. I started to far back to make an impact but still had a fantastic race to start the season. @fisnc
Tough start in @RukaNordic today. Jumping just missing the the direction but it will come. Looking forward to Sundays team sprint. #usnoco
Happy thanksgiving to everyone. Today @RukaNordic gave us sun for the first time. It was amazing to have some natural light!
@timmydugganUSA there is not much teaching. All you have to do is throw yourself off of the jump first.
@timmydugganUSA Thanks man for supporting our team! Come out and ski with us sometime!
@annikenaalbu are you ready for hunger games in a couple weeks? #dontwatchityet
Good work @USSpeedskating at the @ApoloOhno invitational. The team event never disappoints, as it always exciting till the finish!
No better Way to start a season than getting a massage before the international flight to @RukaNordic thanks @KneadaMassage for the support!
@jdjarrett1970 had a bday today. He was even on the winning floor hockey team! thanks for coaching on your bday!

@a_gator4 @timharan @TeamUSANA it was great to work with her and the team. They killed it.
@BenjaminBerend how bout you use pancakes more often in the kitchen. Learning how to cook is good for the soul and me.
@GiantBicycle try nordic skiing. The Cross over is great, and much more manageable.
Check out the new @cleanbottle! Not often you can do this much with a bottle, and have it look so good. https://t.co/ukh3XokAY0 #bestbottle

Heading back to the states tomorrow! Very excited for some time off. Happy with how the season ended and motivated to get going again!
@FastBigDog felt very tired so he figured he would just lie on the floor in a local health food shop, blames sleep, and not the skiing today
Looking at the positive, today was a good step to finish the season off strong. In Falun I will have a great jump and great race.
Very tough day at Holmenkollen. Had a great competition jump that put me in the hunt for a great finish. But then I couldn't xc ski today!
First World Cup individual in a while. A good day in Trondheim, Norway! Unlucky on the hill with wind but did what I could. Good ski though!
