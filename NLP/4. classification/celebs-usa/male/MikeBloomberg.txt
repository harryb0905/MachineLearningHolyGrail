Air pollution is a threat to our environment &amp; public health, but we have a chance to take action, save millions of lives &amp; improve economies in the process. Countries can spur progress by making cities a part of the solution – India is just one example. https://t.co/x20jv1TGz5
Remember that when @realdonaldtrump’s own administration produced a report showing that we face “substantial damage to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health” from climate change, his response was: "I don’t see it."
This president’s rejection of science and reason is a danger to us all. The Pentagon and intel community believe climate change poses a threat to our security, and including a climate denier on a sham panel to undermine those reports won’t change reality. https://t.co/84kVoZRdnU
Building a wall won't solve our real challenges:   — Fighting climate change — Ending senseless gun violence — Creating jobs — Making health care more affordable — Stopping the opioid crisis — Improving public schools &amp; making college more affordable — Investing in infrastructure
Trump's decision to declare a national emergency over a crisis that does not exist while ignoring other true national crises is a total failure of presidential leadership. It's a dangerous, cynical political game. https://t.co/2OMI6zwUmz
Congratulations to @GovSisolak and Nevada’s legislature on making gun safety background checks law. Nevada is the latest proof that the will of the American people will not be ignored when it comes to gun safety. https://t.co/uV1PjWBDDB https://t.co/KRLnqSPte4
Unilaterally declaring a national emergency to build a wall to appease Trump's political base is politics at its worst. Diverting money away from areas where it's needed is government at its worst. This is no way to run a country.
Today, I remember the seventeen students and staff members who were shot and killed and the seventeen who were injured at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and I renew my commitment to honor them – and all victims of gun violence – with action.
As Republicans obstruct progress on climate action, I – and local leaders around the country – will continue to accelerate our work. Glad to be in Washington tonight with members of congress and the community, for a special screening of @ParistoPittsubrgh. https://t.co/vsNTDYOK7V https://t.co/EqlgVUK0Lx
Accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels requires swift action and leadership. Thanks to @MayorofLA Eric Garcetti for taking bold steps toward powering Los Angeles with 100% clean energy. https://t.co/JorOj6wj3H
@realDonaldTrump @TVAnews As any business leader knows, the top consideration at @TVAnews is cost. Phasing out that coal plant will save Kentuckians money (not to mention their air &amp; water). #BeyondCoal
I believe immigration is the American story. The entire basis for our country's success is that people come here to build better lives for themselves &amp; their families. That is our story.

Coal pollution has real consequences for our environment and public health. While the WH props up the coal industry, we’ve been working w/ partners like @SierraClub to retire plants &amp; lead the transition to clean energy. But our work is just getting started—we can &amp; must do more. https://t.co/IlpLSXLzTh
I hope David &amp; Claudia's leadership will inspire others to step up on higher education.

While the president sounds the alarm about a wall we don’t need, he ignores real challenges like climate change and gun violence — which claims 100 lives a day inside our borders. We won’t be distracted from finding solutions. #SOTU
American greatness began with immigrants. Choosing greatness starts with understanding that. And it means choosing real solutions to our broken immigration system over gimmicks like a wall.
In 2016 @BloombergDotOrg launched the American Talent Initiative because we believed we could do more to increase college access regardless of income. Today that network has grown to 100+ schools making a difference for students who, like me, never expected to go to a top college https://t.co/jolY8w7jn1
Ralph Northam has been a good Governor and champion for gun safety, but in light of this racist and deeply offensive yearbook photo he can no longer lead Virginia effectively. For the good of the state he should resign and step aside.
The science is clear: Climate change makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense. Americans are seeing this first hand from wildfires to hurricanes to the #PolarVortex in the Midwest. We need a climate champion in the WH who can lead us forward. https://t.co/duIPO1nVtB
Manufacturing is a vital source of middle class jobs in New Hampshire &amp; across the country, but the President's trade war is driving up factory costs &amp; making it harder for companies to hire and grow. America's workers deserve a president who will work for them, not against them. https://t.co/M1odrxQHEt
Today I announced I'll outline a plan for a Green New Deal, accelerating US transition to 100% clean energy.
