@joepabike @Michael_Creed @Blarob @deceuninck_qst @IljoKeisse Thinking about this for a day... and hearing from @IljoKeisse made me change my tune a bit. Maybe a few months off and a few months salary donated to an associated cause would be enough. The guy is sorry. As an individual. Just think his team took the wrong tack. Big time.
Received a very sweet and contrite  note from @IljoKeisse this evening asking for advice. I just said to apologize with your heart. And explain why you mean it. God knows I did some shitty and stupid things in my time. You just have to sorry. And if it doesn‚Äôt work, say it again.
@joepabike @Michael_Creed @Blarob @deceuninck_qst @IljoKeisse Try that again. I would be required to pay out contract. No legal reason to dismiss. But I wouldn‚Äôt want the dude in team kit anymore.
@joepabike @Michael_Creed @Blarob @deceuninck_qst @IljoKeisse Yep.

@danlindfield @cyclingweekly It does. That‚Äôs the simple truth. I don‚Äôt like it any more than you do.
@danlindfield @cyclingweekly Ooo... I forgot. 2017: 8th in UCI ranking, Sunweb 16th. In 2018 16th in UCI ranking, Sunweb 8th.... maybe do a tiny bit of research on budgets AND results before making silly statements. Yours truly, slightly annoyed and defensive, JV
@danlindfield @cyclingweekly That‚Äôs funny. Same budget! But hey, results aren‚Äôt too different. 2nd in TdF 2017. 2nd in TdF 2018.
@CaleyFretz Well... I mean, I‚Äôm the expert in toilets....sooo...
@Athlete_Mgmt Right. Good point. How this: You're a worthless ratfucker! Thanks, JV
@ValenzuelaSerch @Agustinab I've got all kinds of idea. But those two are amongst the easiest to execute on. A bit hard to convey all via twitter. And, unlike your earlier supposition, our team is a more valuable entity on the sponsorship market than Quickstep. I'll let you figure out why...

I suppose I should be badmouthing Brailsford today, like he did regards me when our team was in jeopardy. But hey, guess what? I‚Äôm not going to! Because this isn‚Äôt a failing of Dave Brailsford. This is a wake up call to start reinventing the way professional cycling is structured
@SenatorBrophy @holowesko Oooo... that gives me an idea for the guest bedroom.

@joelindsey My guess? Loss harvesting. Waltons‚Äô spit out $800M each year on dividends from Walmart. Anything to mitigate the taxes on that beast. If there were losses to be taken post acquisition, I‚Äôm sure they found them. Just a guess.

@HannibalJerkin If you read the post @philgaimon is upset about, you‚Äôll see the guy basically says ‚Äúhe‚Äôs Doping, because no way you can go that fast up hills on Strava if you didn‚Äôt make it as a WT rider.‚Äù I just explained exactly how that is possible. Different people have different gifts.
@philgaimon Right. Exactly. Anyhow, that guy is a brainless  numptie.
Phil has exceptional max aerobic capacity, hence his ability to ride 10-45 mins really fast up a hill-ie Strava..However, he is a ‚Äúsugar burner‚Äù with smallish glycogen tank+low capacity for fat oxidation. Therefore, not so great over 200km day in/day out situations, ie WT racing. https://t.co/gvxUt1p5x3

@philiphult Thanks boss.
@S13SFC @TheRaceRadio You‚Äôre missing the point. Global sponsors do not care about 90% of the races QS wins. A local Belgian sponsor? Sure. But that‚Äôs not the business we‚Äôre in.

@markhampyro Polka dots.
@rusty_woods Thanks, buddy! Send it!!!
@jverheul @WillettKirk @nealrogers @scottsROW Yep. Anything that is mass participation, aspirational, and inclusive (not exclusive) will be the path forward. Think NY Marathon. Ironman. Both sustainable businesses.
@WillettKirk @nealrogers @jverheul @scottsROW Although, to be clear, I don‚Äôt think that format is what the future of US racing is. Mini stage races aren‚Äôt attractive anymore.
@WillettKirk @nealrogers @jverheul @scottsROW Cycling = sponsorship revenue driven. Cycling = expensive at top level. Global exposure is what makes it tick. Not US. It is all about TdF. No one dreams of finishing 12th place at Cascade. If you want to make Cascade relevant globally? Make it part of pathway to the top.
Pretty incredible the strides @rusty_woods has made since a few short years ago. Beautiful athlete. Beautiful person. Congrats, buddy.
@WillettKirk @nealrogers @jverheul @scottsROW The point I was making to Neal(and in other comments here) was that the focus should be grassroots&gt;Junior devo teams&gt;u23 teams&gt;WT teams... The start is in a high school race in a park and the dream is the TdF.
@Mike_OMC_Creed @WillettKirk @jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW Right. Hence my point in Neal‚Äôs article regarding NICA being the way forward. Even though he didn‚Äôt credit NICA for some reason!!?
@WillettKirk @nealrogers @jverheul @scottsROW Yes, but that goes to my first point about development. Where I see waste is $4M pro conti teams that are neither here nor there.
@WillettKirk @jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW Btw - it‚Äôs not like I actually like what I‚Äôm describing above. I hate it. But it is the truth.
@Vlaanderen90 @nealrogers They should. And I put my $ where my mouth is on that one.
@WillettKirk @jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW Fact is TdF will always dominate imagination, as it transcends the rest of the sport. And is the ONLY medium for bike racers to achieve financial success that might outlive their active careers. And the ONLY race that produces metrics that justify +$5M spend for sponsors
@Tomashuuns Stranger Things....
@flickstrong I know, man. I miss that stuff too.
@flickstrong It‚Äôs fairly Machiavellian of me. But just saying what I think would reinvigorate things...
@jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW I think US cycling needs two things: participation and narrative. Participation in events like Dirty Kanza. Narrative in ‚Äúthis u23 could one day be a TdF Star‚Äù.... old pro conti teams provide neither of those.
@flickstrong Well.... sadly, that‚Äôs kinda the point. I see the future of US racing like this: 1. Open to everyone NY marathon type stuff like Dirty Kanza 2. U23 ‚Äúnext TdF hopefully‚Äù racing and 3. A few marquee WT events like TOC that bring over top talent.
@jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW My opinion is that money to create that ‚Äòmiddle class‚Äô should be spent on making very robust u23 programs. And lots of them. Aevolo and Axeon type organizations.
@nealrogers @Vlaanderen90 Yes. That‚Äôs correct. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt feel the situation. It‚Äôs that I think there‚Äôs been a fundamental mistake in putting resources into pro-conti teams that aren‚Äôt developing any talent that can ever make it in the WT.
@jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW It‚Äôs a long road to truly develop in Europe. And it takes its toll. WT Guys come back to USA from that meat grinder and get their asses kicked by domestic teams. But then you take those same domestic riders who kicked your butt to WT races in Europe and they just die.
@jverheul @nealrogers @scottsROW It‚Äôs not about that. I‚Äôve never once been in a bidding war over a guy with US based pro conti team. My thoughts would reduce my cost basis by zero. I just see big resources being given to domestic riders that won‚Äôt move forward. Save it for promising talent.
@texas_by_bike @nealrogers @CaleyFretz Yep. Spot on. This isn‚Äôt about professional cycling. This is about society changing.
@luke_beatty Wait..... less lunching?
@Pflax1 Pole dancing is the new golf
This deal manages to thread the needle of protecting rider and team interests. Obligatory larger team sizes and WT race participation keep more riders in with jobs. Also, keeping WT teams at 18 ensures more riders will be employed, while 3 year licenses protects equity value. https://t.co/l19NVfP2SI
Very nice work by ‚Å¶@bugno_gianni‚Å© and ‚Å¶@iwanspekenbrink‚Å© in getting a fair deal in place for the riders and teams. Getting UCI and ASO to budge is way harder than it looks! Chapeau to both of you.   https://t.co/yaR8UPDrFP

@jenscer @Ride_Argyle We kept it running a large portion of 2011 on redirected funds. And we (not cervelo) paid $400k to sponsor AA drinks in 2012. Again, in redirected funds.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle It wasn‚Äôt discretionary. So, no, I had to go and beg for permission to redirect funds, as opposed to just bankrupting women‚Äôs team early in year and nullifying the contracts via multiple clauses that state ‚Äúif team is insolvent, your contract is dissolved‚Äù
üôÑ https://t.co/K0oKk7R8wQ
Quite a handsome team. https://t.co/Wfq9nnVjgV
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle Yes, I prioritized the women‚Äôs team over the men‚Äôs team. I used funds that were supposed to go into other areas into making sure all the women were made whole, financially.
@DaleJHarrison @ammattipyoraily Young is the key word. He already did Giro. That‚Äôs enough this early in his career.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle My personal priorities and those of other investors and sponsors are not always the same.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle Or I should say Cervelo‚Äôs prior owners.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle That‚Äôs because I‚Äôve never spoken about it, out of respect for Cervelo.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle So, yeah, I‚Äôm sure they all are upset. But they all got paid everything they were owed. Which is far more than can be said for many other programs. None of them knew what happened behind the scenes.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle Bit hard to do a good job when your financial backer is about to go bankrupt, you‚Äôre having to siphon money out of men‚Äôs program just to make payroll, and all your current investors are upset that their money is being used for something they didn‚Äôt sign up for.
@jenscer @Ride_Argyle Yes, by all means, have a strong opinion about a situation you know nothing about. Very Trumpian of you.
@jenscer @thedirtfield @followadam @EF @Ride_Argyle No. Cervelo blew it by not honoring their payment schedule. But yeah, go ahead, blame me. It‚Äôs what I get paid for!!

@PatrickAnge Agree.
Not backwards at all. By leveling playing field, races become more unpredictable and exciting. Increasing attractiveness and viewership numbers, which in turn would increase sponsorship dollars. Sports with financial fairness caps have proven more successful over past 20 years. https://t.co/e6gLOdZddG

@billgifford @iamjensee You need more cowbell in your climbing.
@reserve_in @DanMartin86 @romainbardet I just don‚Äôt think it would have any genuine effect on the racing. I base that on having riders race without power meters from time to time.
@RichN95 Yeah, I consulted on/assisted with a major rebrand/market pivot of a Fortune 50 Financial services company that has $1 Trillion assets under management.  And that means jack shit in the context of the WT cycling market.
@mrshrbrmstr It‚Äôs not unrelated at all.
@RichN95 Hahaha!! Please tell me what business DB came from? Because I could introduce you to some folks that might have some insight into that.
@RichN95 Anyhow, I know you aren‚Äôt going to look at this multidimensionally. So, let‚Äôs just call it a day. Have a good one. I‚Äôll just be here waiting to keep getting lucky for another 10 years!
@RichN95 I‚Äôll say it again: you do not grasp the marketplace. Please name one other global corporate sponsor that‚Äôs entered WT cycling in the last 5 years? My people haven‚Äôt failed me in the least in marketing. In fact they‚Äôve performed well above marketplace.
@RichN95 So, apologies for being an ass, but your original comment is so far off base in so many ways.
@RichN95 2/2:  In addition to this, I might add I graduated with honors from an MBA program focused on marketing - and - recently was nominated for and finished 1 year leadership tenure at McKinsey academy. Ever heard of McKinsey? Might ring a bell for someone as in tune as yourself.
@RichN95 1/2 Oh wow, good job in actually asking a question; - I do not hands on manage marketing of Slipstream Sports. People specialized in marketing do. This is the case with most teams. I am the most visible member of the business side, but I‚Äôm far from alone.   CEO is not marketing.
@RichN95 Yeah. You‚Äôve nailed it. Glad to see such knowledge and well thought out commentary.
@MerelyDarren Tried.Years ago. In 2011 for the 2012 season. I just got outbid. And when I bid again, it went even higher. Sky is like a guy at auction that just raises his paddle and doesn‚Äôt put it down until he wins. No way I could win that war now. G‚Äôs salary will be about 50% of our payroll
@MerelyDarren All parties, really....
@MerelyDarren Ooooooh. Well, there could be a component of that. For sure. I just think making the TdF less predictable would benefit all sponsors.
Design thinking at its best. I like it. https://t.co/hVXHoGe087
@RichN95 Wow. There‚Äôs an uneducated opinion based on zero knowledge of other teams. Thanks for playing. Try again.
@MerelyDarren Vendetta against who?
@PodiumCafe Nice. I like it.
@_dottigirl_ @SWORKSL4 True story.
To be clear, the radio and power meter ban stuff is just dumb. But the rest shows good critical thinking.
While I have not been a fan of Lappartient; quite a few of his ideas said here make business sense. The parties in Cycling need to stop focusing on their individual needs, and start looking at how to make the sport more competitive in a 21st century entertainment/media landscape. https://t.co/uU69xRmmRZ

Gracias a todos!!! @danifmartinez96 y @Ride_Argyle han salvado al dia. Ni un segundo perdido!!! #milagro #gorigogo https://t.co/kIQWQTweqG
@vanderkaaden @jwcraw @lawsoncraddock 1. He is not. No painkillers beyond Advil/Tylenol. 2. His injury presents zero risk, long term. It just hurts.

Truly inspiring effort by the entire team today. #rideargyle #tdf #proudpapa
Amazing. @lawsoncraddock
TTT nerves; I always feel bad for the bus toilet on days like this.
Events are the stage which teams perform. The spotlight events provide is what drives our ability to sell sponsorship.

@LucasJaxion Thank you for sending along.
@LucasJaxion No. But it exemplifies my point.
@EuroHoody Regime! Mois du kilos!
@jkwagnermd @AlkekVelodrome No! Someone who hides from testers in a safe room? No. Just no. She should apologize to the DCO who had to conduct the test. Good grief.

Let‚Äôs hope that @AlkekVelodrome has enough funding to make it a covered SuperDrome by the end of this #TdF!! Good first step towards that. https://t.co/fdPfrWKuoh
@Joe684 Tylenol, Advil. NSAIDS like that. Also, CBD is completely legal, if it‚Äôs 100% free of THC....Right @FloydLeadville ??!
Aiiiiiii..... so tense, so dangerous...It looks calm. But inside the peloton it‚Äôs a war of subtleties.
@CKucway I‚Äôm defending people who work 13 hour a day in anti-doping laboratories for low wages.
So far, so good for @lawsoncraddock... if the pace remains steady like this until 30-40kms to go, he stands a chance of making it home. Each day will be better after that.
@DavidWalshST David, you and I both know how hard the people in Anti-Doping work. And how under resorced they are. Maybe as opposed to deriding them, you could make an appeal to help give them more resources to better execute on the work they do.
@Trudgin @RealStephens No concussion. No structural damage to the bone. Pain is from soft tissue injury. So, there‚Äôs no medical reason he can‚Äôt continue, if he can handle the pain.
Hard as nails. Nice mascara too, but why only one eye? https://t.co/9RqQ98posu
It‚Äôs years of work to get to this point. His emotions are real and felt. We‚Äôll hope for a miracle tonight and see what tomorrow brings. https://t.co/nngjw5ldFY
Hey @serenawilliams.... my boy @lawsoncraddock crashed hard today. Bleeding heavily. X-rays still to determine if anything is broken. And guess what? He still had anti-doping knocking on the door after the race. He complied. No complaints at all.
Hmmmmmm #13. Ug.
@EdKenkle @Cycling_mad1 Exactly.
@Cycling_mad1 Well, I agree with that too. But I‚Äôm not in love with a UCI president that says ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt me!‚Äù
Ultimately, it‚Äôs the responsibility of the UCI to ensure athlete‚Äôs confidentiality rights are upheld. Avoiding taking responsibility, no matter what the exact mechanics of the leak were, shows poor leadership. https://t.co/iAyO9UXYYT

@GenOrnsby @irishpeloton I don‚Äôt think you can use them to stab other players in the eye, but beyond that....
@ulif Rocking it old Skool!
@ulif They were testing out a new motor model, plus seeing if their blood types were compatible.
@ulif Actually, we have new members and the shares are actually worth more. Yay! Let me know when the shame wears off, and we‚Äôll get you a band-aid.
@SkyOrla @SkySportsNews Makeup will need to powder his head well. Just thought I‚Äôd give you a heads up.
@Chipolonie @Kenny_Pryde Actually, considering I helped WADA index format the biopassport back in 2006-2008, I do have quite the leg to stand on. Maybe 3 or 4 legs even. Big legs. With feet.
@Scienceofsport We talking Great Danes or Pugs?
@Cheapoflurane Smells a bit funny, eh?
Guess that was a lot of debate for nothing...
@ebbenieuweboer @Jimmy_Matamata My comply comment is based more in WADA code, to which UCI is a signatory. Which expressly prevents any punishment being given to an athlete beyond what is outlined in the code. Not racing tdf = punishment.
@ebbenieuweboer The word ‚Äúguilty‚Äù is a implicit in nature. So, yeah, it is kinda what you said.
@ebbenieuweboer @Jimmy_Matamata Never said ASO didn‚Äôt have the right to try. I‚Äôll get my swim trunks on now, if you don‚Äôt mind.
@ebbenieuweboer AAF does not equal ‚Äúfound guilty‚Äù as you said earlier.
@ebbenieuweboer @Jimmy_Matamata Sure, they can try. I can try to swim across the Atlantic too.
@ebbenieuweboer 1) No, he has not. Not yet. 2) No court is going to uphold ‚Äúimage damage‚Äù based on an AAF that hasn‚Äôt gone through due process. Watch the outcome of this....
This defending Sky thing kinda kills me. It‚Äôs like defending Darth Vader... claiming he was missing limbs, so he couldn‚Äôt have committed the crime.
Ok, let me address this: Yes, that rule exists. However, in this case the rider not been found guilty of anything AND more importantly *has not even been formally accused of anything* by UCI/WADA. So, to claim ‚Äúdamage‚Äù to reputation is a reach, to say the least. https://t.co/N065O2oCPG
@NCRadicalEd Yeah. Me too.
The crux to what I‚Äôm saying: Le Tour is run under the regulations of the UCI, which is a signatory to the WADA code. ASO chose to run the TdF under these regulatory umbrellas (unlike Phil‚Äôs cookie fondo)...Therefor, ASO must comply to the rules they CHOSE to sign up for.
@Damo66953588 @chrisfroome It‚Äôs their race that they CHOOSE to run under the WADA code. Hence: No, it‚Äôs not their choice.
@TheBoulderSC @chrisfroome Beyond that, ‚Äúimage damage‚Äù by a rider who has been declared guilty of nothing is subjective, at best - and probably unenforceable under any version of EU law, but especially in an event that resides under WADA/UCI umbrella/rules. He‚Äôll be on the start line. Watch.
@TheBoulderSC @chrisfroome I know it‚Äôs cool to be in law school and all, but: There is not a private contract between SKy and ASO. The contract that is exists is tripartite with the UCI as a signatory and subject to UCI/WADA rules; ie not private. So, the argument is sound.
As I‚Äôve said before, I don‚Äôt think @chrisfroome should race until the case is resolved. However, at this point, legally speaking: *It‚Äôs his choice*.....ASO just making up their own rules as to who gets invited to the cool party poses a much greater long term threat to the sport.
@seppkuss @JimMiller_time @dauphine @AmgenTOC @giroditalia @Haute_Route @finsty Ok, but as we all know, WT racing performance is more about the peaks of power while fatigued or not, than it is about total workload or measured body stress. I mean, if TSS is the standard, then Tommy D should have been 8x TdF champ.
Well, that worked out nicely, we sign Julius VDB yesterday, and he wins Dutch National u23 Champs in impressive solo fashion today.
This just makes me angry. Cyclists have this sort of thing happen all the time. No complaints at all. Part of the job. https://t.co/Q5FTxPmAN9

@dunks517 @cyclingreporter No idea. That was like 30years ago.
@dunks517 @cyclingreporter Of course he does. But no one is going to strike over his opinions.
@TomScorza @cyclingreporter My tweet = realistic. Riders aren‚Äôt going to strike at the TdF over a comment by BH nor a situation regarding Froome. Nor should they be asked to. If proper enforcement of the rules is desired, then respect and improvement of legal process should be the focus.

Happy to see IOC doing the right thing regarding Russia in the Olympics. Chasing individual athletes around is rarely an effective tool at stopping doping. Cracking down on systemic issues is effective.

@fmk_RoI Think the average is about ‚Ç¨20-‚Ç¨22M. What Pat says is right. Without budget caps(or however you want to phrase it) in place, an extra ‚Ç¨1M just gets chewed up in bidding wars for top 3% of riders. Adds nothing to stability.

@joelindsey I think I may apply...
@BriSmithy Wait.... when do I get my trophy? I was a guest one day. Pretty sure it had something to do with it.
@mdohn I wish I had good advice! It's like fishing... you need the right bait, be in the right spot, and then be very patient.

@timmydugganUSA @IlLombardia When I did it, it was snowing. Or hurricanes were pounding northern Italy. The older I get, the tougher it was.
Grandi @UranRigoberto !!!!
Such horrible news from Las Vegas. I just don't understand.
@imdonncha @inrng Yep
@ralph_cigaretto We actually specified at the end of the campaign $$ will be used for sports science efforts and rider education.
@IronNewsGirl @inrng Hahahaha!!! Oh man. You get a zero on the exam.
After reading @inrng article on Team Sky finances, I decided to start pursuing further sponsorship. Pretty sure I got a solid lead... https://t.co/jZdFkIE26y

@friebos @LarsBartoli Quite the info graphic.
@rich_thyer @richardmoore73 @JournalVelo @lionelbirnie @FranReyesF @EF We call them 'edibles' in Colorado.
Just a small tweet: *Thank you*to all of our fans and supporters. You guys made an outsized contribution to our team. You made it happen. JV
@richardmoore73 @JournalVelo @lionelbirnie @FranReyesF What sort of candy was he trying to give out?
@Cyclocosm I'll be curious to see how many people get that...
@Cyrus_Monk Actually, yes! That's been something we've talked about.
I am so pleased to welcome @EF to our team. Such a fun and interesting partner to have. Teaching communication across different cultures.
@Alexmarr98 @CaleyFretz Yes.
@PuckBuddys @TheRaceRadio @alex_howes Yes. But no pants allowed.

@TheBoulderSC Daimo.... you are not single due to being a good person. I mean, I like you, but let's be realistic about history here.
@prayingmantimis @andrewtalansky It's not a breakup. It's a re-position.
@ianrobo1 @andrewtalansky I know. I know. Oops.
Here's wishing @andrewtalansky the best of luck in all his ventures going forward!!! The pit bull will be back. Just in another form... https://t.co/lVkkSncpYp
@jamie_1st @RichN95 @dmic12 And sponsor funded. But very few tax dollars. People lose their shit over that sort of thing here in the far west.
@jamie_1st @RichN95 @dmic12 Nope. Donor funded.
@SenatorBrophy Mushrooms growing on your scrotum...
@jamie_1st Nope.
@slimnshady Yep
@alex_howes @philgaimon @wouterwippert @TourOfAlberta @Ride_Argyle How many did Joe do?
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 Those teams will come around. Eventually. Just might be a decade.
@marinaroj @bernie_langer Only if you choose. I'd rather up athlete care. But that's a strategic decision in the game of equal budgets.
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 To be clear: Sky alone isn't the issue. Just a part of it. BMC had similar budget. But not similar success.
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 Ok. I see your point. However, I get to see the behind the scenes offers Sky puts to guys. They buy the riders we all want. At a premium.
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 I should say this applies specifically to NFL. But NFL has outstripped other leagues partially due to this policy.
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 See, so that is a cultural difference. In USA, fan base is not icon dependent. People root for teams. Not stars. Audience growth broader.
@bernie_langer I think a budget cap, rather than salary cap makes more sense. If you want to spend more in athlete payroll you can.
@PappyFitz Yes. True. But it's just a simple contractual agreement between all team owners to play by certain rules.
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 Let me ask you this: If Landa and Kwiatowski were on rival teams, do you not feel the TdF might have been more competitive- entertaining?
@TheDirtyEuro @RichN95 @dmic12 Bingo. This isn't my idea. At all. I'm just pointing out a good method to grow the sport and audience size overall.
@RichN95 @TheDirtyEuro @dmic12 That's not even my response you're screaming at.
@RichN95 @dmic12 So, your assessment is empirically incorrect.
@RichN95 @dmic12 We had fewer ex-doers than any other team in that era. Difference? Ours were honest about it. Others were forced to lie or lose job.
@RichN95 @dmic12 Oh dear. Now you're getting angry and personal. Learn to debate the actual issue.
@RichN95 @dmic12 Incorrect. Cycling has never been popular or artificially propped up in an Olympic "nation building" exercise like w UK funds in the USA.
@pcxmo Hah! Yes. One at a time. Luxury tax works for me. Better than nuttin
@RichN95 @dmic12 This foundation building subsidy was hardly available to others in countries that do not subsidize sports w public funds.
@RichN95 @dmic12 Examples r plentiful. To start: Sky was built on the foundations of the success of the U.K. Olympic track program; funded by govt lottery...
@RichN95 @dmic12 Market is not equal or open. Many teams subsidized by governments, supported by faddish nationalism, etc. Very different landscape for each
*EXACTLY* https://t.co/bv4mWRwFAb
@saladdodgerbren @EuroHoody 6
@letstalkcycling @adrianartn @EuroHoody Yep. That unfortunate, but probably true.
@EuroHoody He said ‚Ç¨15M on rider payroll. Not budget. A ‚Ç¨15M rider payroll would equal a ‚Ç¨23M budget. Roughly.

Forget about all the drama around @Ride_Argyle for a minute...my wife @vinovaughters just became the first Master of Wine EVER in Colorado!!

@KidKarbon @ParisToPalermo @TeamDiData @Qhubeka I mean, for sure I am a shady dude. I've got more skeletons in the closet than your local undertaker.
@Pflax1 Liposuction: it's what the pros do.
@imdonncha Just because sponsors are staying on board, doesn't mean it's always for the same amount every year.
Thank you! The success of this campaign is making an enormous difference in how the world views cycling+our team-YOU will allow us to go on! https://t.co/gRGZX1GXjS

@seankrahenbuhl That's a good point. @Ride_Argyle ??
@prayingmantimis @Digger_forum @dwuori That's actually a good idea. Anyone know how to set this up? @Digger_forum and JV podcast! Oh man.
Feeling a bit like Mel Gibson in Braveheart.... "you can never take our cycling teeeeaaaaaammmmmm....." ......#SaveArgyle
It's been a rollercoaster few days. So much so, I need a barf bag. That said, I think I will have some more good news coming soon. ü§û
@Ffejeroo We won't take money, unless we find enough to actually have a 2018 team.
@Digger_forum @dwuori Thanks, buddy. I've always just been trying to earn your respect. Which usually leads to us disagreeing. But thank you.
@DrHeadgear Both.
@MichaelCarcaise Ideally, someone steps in at full price and we refund all your $$$. The price reduction is a possible scenario too. Its pretty fluid.

We aren't there yet, by a long shot, but the generosity of everyone has been great, and we are only 12 hours in. Lots of fight left.
@Gaina_Cee Working on that. Thank you.
Everyone: Your commitments to our crowd sourcing effort are exceeding all expectations. Thank you. More to come....
@j8ybb @mikefeldmanNY @Xerox Be happy to. And I agree about data analytics. @mikefeldmanNY would you be willing to take a phone call regarding this?
Great ride by all of @Ride_Argyle today @lavuelta ... Team is showing its true grit, when things are tough and discouraging. Bravo.

@PsycleFan I would either A. Pay my staff and riders better B. Start a women's team or C. Start a u23 team - with the money it took to buy that *thing*
@jasongay Oh dear.
@wsquared3d Been down this road many many many times.
@wsquared3d Correct. But marketing decisions are still separate. We race in Europe, so US marketing says no. But we're a US team, so Euros say No.
@wsquared3d Ford, like most car companies, operates in regional divisions. We are a US team racing in europe. Meaning we fit neither. Been here before.

@nealrogers Well, exactly. The idea isn't to actually catch Alex.
@nealrogers Btw - no idea if it'll work.
@nealrogers Oldest trick in the book. Chase from behind. Allows teammate to sit on and forces others in break to work harder.

@nealrogers Because in August it never rains in the afternoon in the Colorado mountains. Ever.
@RA_Dall Yes
@STS_blackforest @TeamPureSavage @LouisMeintjes Dude. Do you have any clue how talented and how hard you have to work to manage what LM does? Have some respect. Please.
@KJagers @waxonwaxoff82 I don't think so.
@waxonwaxoff82 No no. Was referring to Formolo.
@davideformolo So, not only are you announcing you're leaving the team, but you're also throwing it out there that you're a swinger?
@wellchuffedrob Well, let's just say they aren't leaving for 10% more. The differences are quite large and the career quite short.
@wellchuffedrob Nah. Mainly because I smell really bad.
Yeah..hurts watching guys you've put a lot of heart into leave team-that's life- looking forward to developing more under appreciated talent

@julienpretotRTR Yes there is. But you should wear a condom.
@usacycling @petebutler @UCI_cycling Less fighting and more love in Twitter.
@fmk_RoI btw - I agree with you.
@fmk_RoI I have to be happy. But I never asked for what they did. We accepted the penalty.
@GenOrnsby @UCI_cycling I did do that. But this is the ruling. Also, remember the most important rule: Never piss against the wind.
Hey @realDonaldTrump, did you and @EmmanuelMacron call up the @UCI_cycling jury? #askingforafriend #BFFs #bastille #combover
@joostaelmans @UCI_cycling @georgenbennett @LottoJumbo_road yes. Same.
@erikvanleeuwen @UCI_cycling no penalty for Bennett either.
Incredible news!!!  @UCI_cycling has reversed decision!!! No penalty for Rigo!!!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!
@jonbeetle @mjshrimper Soooo... he's being inconsistent regards his own words. Rigo's feed also NOT from team staff. Inconsistent.
@jonbeetle @mjshrimper Unfortunately, @UCI_cycling commisaire said "doesn't matter if feed came from a small child, the penalty is same"
The UCI reaction by both Phillipe Marien and comms officer Sebastien Gillot: "The jury does not‚Ä¶ https://t.co/XFNrN6i3BM
Just posted a video https://t.co/XFNrN6i3BM
@dfan44 yes. They didn't see him take bottle.
2 things to close night: 1. I do not think there is a French bias, I think there is incompetence 2. Would be better if NO ONE was penalized
@RichardPlugge Of course I did. But that was quickly dismissed. To be fair, execs shouldn't interfere with race juries.
@RichardPlugge I asked if Marien was the best choice for head of jury, considering multiple inconsistent decisions.
@bahama32 actually, yes I did.
@daniellloyd1 @jasongay @JeremySeysses yes. That would do it.
I have spoken to UCI execs. Productive conversation, but wall exists between jury and executive team, so no change in ruling. #bummer
@stefrees @julienpretotRTR Yes! Preferably none!
@mmcm86 @willfoth @friebos @Camilo_Villa @Veloracer5 @EuroHoody @Ride_Argyle No stress.
@mmcm86 @willfoth @friebos @Camilo_Villa @Veloracer5 @EuroHoody @Ride_Argyle No. was NOT employee. Dude works hospitality for Cannondale.
@StevieCarnie @k3scmidt @meta9 @UCI_cycling I know! These guys are nuts.
@moyesie22 much rather NO ONE gets a penalty.
@daniellloyd1 @jasongay You'd never get a hangover from a 1947 Cheval Blanc. Never. @JeremySeysses
@daniellloyd1 @simonbattle007 Nope.
@Nitram340 @cesarperez1908 @LeTour Yes. Correct. But that's not how @UCI_cycling sees it.
@simonbattle007 it's in a book, so it must be true, right?
@Nitram340 @cesarperez1908 @LeTour No. It was a 3rd party in both cases.
@bochacamickael @luke0411 No team employee or designee fed Rigo. And, btw, not what we were told by @UCI_cycling
@calichepaisa @Tara_Ma_rs yes. Of course.
I would like to update you, but @UCI_cycling executives and officials have yet to respond to my calls/texts/emails.
@Tara_Ma_rs  Ok, that's fine. Then neither rider should be penalized. Rigo's feed was not by anyone employed by team or licensed by UCI.
@mariacross75 @UCI_cycling Oui? Send me video, please!
In the exact words of @UCI_cycling commisaire Philippe Marien "The feed could have been from anyone, even a small child, still 20s penalty."
Correction, illegal feed was from Cannondale employee. Not team staff. Not spectator. Unfortunately enthusiasm for the team cost us.
@lukascph @julienpretotRTR nope.
Rigo took bottle from spectator within final 10k. We accept penalty. However, Bardet did exactly the same-On video-He needs same penalty.

@festinaboy We are all dirty old men. End of. Although I feel I'm more handsome than the others.
@camille_9191 @IlCobra21 @MRasmussen1974 @LeTour I'm proud of that original deal. Should have held true for anyone who purely volunteered.
@camille_9191 @IlCobra21 @MRasmussen1974 @LeTour oh, no. Not that. That was only for volunteers. Not those dragged in. Didn't happen in end.
@camille_9191 @IlCobra21 @MRasmussen1974 @LeTour Nope. Unlike his version of that story, he got the same offer. Chose to refuse.
@camille_9191 @IlCobra21 @MRasmussen1974 @LeTour That'll continue to be the case, until people are *actually*willing to forgive and forget.
@JeremySeysses fuckity fuck fuck fucker. Sorry man.
@rusty_woods @ianoriordan And that's coming from a guy who has done a 3:50 mile and raced a GT. Zing! #ouch.
@mewmewmew13 nah. No mute. Just tired of politics.
@sarcastitom Trust me, I get it. Just not being as publicly transparent as you.
@sarcastitom yes, I have one of those too. He's learning how to drive stick. My clutch is begging me for a quick death.
@sarcastitom speaking of which, where the heck have you been?
To everyone who's texted and tweeted me in the last day: Thank you so much! Sincerely, hearing from nice people brings me a lot of joy.
Very big thank you to @DavidWalshST for giving some coverage to our fledgling whole athlete well being program. https://t.co/5b6T9XneW7
@KeiraBronte well, that's crap. The canap√©s are really good. I'll try to find something inappropriate to send you instead.
@KeiraBronte Keira, if you have any desire to see the end of the TdF from Paris, you're quite invited to our party. USA embassy. Champs E.
@James_Bale85 I'm an easy date.
@KeiraBronte @daveno7 @Ezy_Ryder No stress. Just want folks to realize, I don't block re difference of opinion. I block when it's mean.
@daveno7 @Ezy_Ryder @KeiraBronte unblocked. I only block people when I feel it's unnecessarily negative+hurtful. Which is a lot these days.
@CaleyFretz don't. Do. It.

@Scienceofsport @joelindsey agreed
@JulieHarden @PierroooRolland Pepe won't let you down. Give it a week or two.
Prognostic @PierroooRolland called Aru for the win today 2 weeks ago. Smart kid ol' Pepe.
Go Rigo Go! #gorigogo!
@JulianHaun race is 3 weeks. Not one day.
One explanation: From director's perspective, sometimes you need to show your leader you have faith in them by having team ride on front.
Interesting... BMC is having to use up over half the team to chase breakaway. Sky sitting pretty and keeping all 9 riders fresh for later.
https://t.co/1GlM98DeKw
@bobbierman @jwcraw @nealrogers Thank you, sir.
@jwcraw @nealrogers Can't mix commercial decisions and sporting regulations. Bad mojo.

-@Ride_Argyle &amp; @natebrown0707 can deny nude meetin all they want. Know what I see: one rider w red dots Sunday &amp; another w red dots Monday
If @Ride_Argyle keeps passing this red dots thing around, we may have to start putting valtrex in the feedbags.
Big bad @natebrown0707 baddest man in the whole damn town. Badder than ol King Kong, meaner than a junkyard dog!!
Ooof.... still, nice work @taylorphinney !!! We'll be doing the chicken dance tonight for your polka dots. #chickendance
Atta boy @taylorphinney !!
Ahhhh.... Froome isn't on his bike. Teammate's.
Interesting to watch riders at front wanting to wait...but not wanting to lose position. Not slowing down much.
Froome a bit twisted on the seat. More than normal. Something is hurting.
@Buck_McCray @euancx @Ride_Argyle @NFL didn't take it that way. Was just trying to explain realities we deal with. Paddy was 100% this AM.
@RickRichter @DylanvanBaarle @taylorphinney Yes. Of course. Was just noting that it was interesting.
@langilleb @DylanvanBaarle @taylorphinney Yes. Most likely.
@Buck_McCray @euancx @Ride_Argyle @NFL Should there be a dispensation for this? Yes. But I don't make the rules.
@Buck_McCray @euancx @Ride_Argyle @NFL Cut off for elimination is 20% of winner's time. If you did full eval on ground: out of the race.
@ksbphoto @DylanvanBaarle @taylorphinney Yep. And cornering speed.
@robdavidgee @DylanvanBaarle @taylorphinney yes. Exactly. Also, TP cornered better.
Interesting, @DylanvanBaarle produced NP of only 9 watts less than @taylorphinney, is also lighter, but went slower. https://t.co/aD2ycFd3um
@tmokh294 @ryder_hesjedal Concussions are no joking matter. We evaluated Paddy and his helmet immediately after finish. Very surprisingly, no evidence of concussion.
@Ricardoh88 @ryder_hesjedal Amazingly and luckily, he's fine. Barely any lost skin. Of course, the morning will tell the truth about how his body really is.
@euancx @Ride_Argyle He had zero signs of concussion in post race testing immediate after and 6hrs after. Helmet was not damaged at all.
@TweeterSagan @ryder_hesjedal It was supposed to have better traction in the corners. I want a refund.
@Cyclenut66 @doc_ryan @climbingcyclist If you want to argue with our docs and race docs, go for it. I know all docs think they know it ALL.
I mean, clearly he's got a motor as the wheels are still spinning, right @ryder_hesjedal ??https://t.co/k5oqNSupJg #scandal #evilconspiracy
@doc_ryan @climbingcyclist No, actually he showed zero symptoms of head injury. Post race testing confirmed. Lucky.
@luke_beatty @Brandfolder I always forget what an ugly bugger I am until I see photos of myself.
Nice work today @taylorphinney. First step back in a long journey. Proud of you. https://t.co/pr4MYJ6Beu

@bambula @ConorTMcGrane @ulif @faustonef Not possible.Unlike w androgens,which can b found in contaminated supps,EPO can't survive digestion
@ulif @faustonef But postings on ADAMS are well after the fact (to prevent 'gaming' of test info) and specifics are not given.
@ulif @faustonef It's in the ADAMS database. Assuming the rider has given consent for us to access his ADAMS, then we are able to look.
@ConorTMcGrane @ulif @faustonef Yeah, I hear you.
@ulif @faustonef We are given total figures at end of year on testing quantity. So, yes, he was OOC tested. Don't recall how much.
@ConorTMcGrane @ulif @faustonef We released him. No new contract offer. But not based on concerns. Just organizational shift to younger guys
@ulif @faustonef Which AC did give consent. So, I can say we were never informed of missed tests.
@ulif @faustonef We don't have access to testing info. We are informed if there are missed tests, provided the rider has given consent.
@faustonef @evilcycling Fuyu Li?
@faustonef  Because people don't have any idea who the management of TS are. They are not publicly available or visible.
@StalwartSt I agree, they do rock. I have no idea what goes on in the heads of GT organizers.
@MPG that is the most absurd response ever. Good grief.

I'm really disappointed in you social media. Zero comments on "split the booty" ....https://t.co/cJk3afqA3a
@PDXWheels @ulif @faustonef No. Not at all. I prefer guys from that era who got nailed or admitted over ones that lied and were lucky.
@ulif @faustonef stable blood values, no missed OOC tests. Internal blood tests always stable. But it's not foolproof.
@Cycling_mad1 @judgedreid @andrewmcquaid @ryanmullen9 It was a joke. Relax. No 4 leaf clovers covering Ryan's black pudding of love.
@ulif @faustonef I'd say more like this: I doubt he did. But I've been wrong before. So, I'm not claiming perfection.
@ulif @faustonef Ok, that's twisting words.
@ulif @faustonef Learned lesson few yrs ago w claiming I absolutely knew rider was doping/not. Genuinely do my best,but know its not perfect

.@DLappartient Ok. Fair enough. I will listen carefully.
.@DLappartient Unfortunately, there are organizations in cycling that prefer teams/athletes to remain unstable. How will you deal w them?
.@DLappartient This fundamental instability is the underpinning motivation for doping in cycling. Without addressing it, doping thrives.
.@DLappartient Thank you, however the question was teams/athletes not just athletes.Mechanics, soigneurs etc are all part of unstable system
@ednl @DLappartient Don't spoil this by introducing your overly logical and well thought out ideas. Let the man speak for himself.
@jaimiefuller @DLappartient One thing to say something. Another to do it. Job is a lot more treacherous than it appears. As you know well.
@OliCoyle @JustinBarrie @jaimiefuller @DLappartient They don't teach pig wrestling in mud in business school. Unfortunately.
@Trudgin I'm rather poor at kissing arse. It limits me in the political arena.
@JustinBarrie @jaimiefuller @DLappartient No. it's a broad question. Applies to more than just men's pro.
@Trudgin oh, I have. And his plan was completely dismantled by an ASO and Lappartient coop.
.@DLappartient Specifically, what is your plan to address the fundamentally unstable employment environment teams/athletes are forced into?
@LarsBartoli never did like me Danish much. Except the pastry. That's pretty good. With coffee.
@KylePrusso It's an unfortunate setup that doesn't seem to correct. Wish I could explain in 140.
@paradisetperdus Not saying you don't have a point. Btw.
@peterbreda2000 hah!! Touch√©.

@grifocx @festinaboy @ammattipyoraily Presidents of National Feds. That's it. That's all.
@festinaboy @ammattipyoraily But hey, here's the thing: Athletes and teams get ZERO vote. So my opinion doesn't matter. At all.
@sauveurmerlan @festinaboy @ammattipyoraily Maybe. But nobody is going to vote for me!
@Netserk93 @ammattipyoraily That is a ridiculous, uneducated, and unfounded opinion based on zero real information.
@festinaboy @ammattipyoraily I have no problem with frogs. You should run Antoine. You aren't in ASO's back pocket.
@ammattipyoraily Lappartient = ASO meat puppet. Hugely negative for athletes and teams.

@DennyCyclist @JoeDombro no. That is not what I meant. You can't force good form if you want to do it naturally.
@Cycling_mad1 Me too. Big time.
@Cycling_mad1 Reading too much into it. Patience applies to all clean riders. Human body can't be forced, despite what fans/pundits push for.
Nice job @JoeDombro..Sometimes it takes longer than you want for the form to come around, but being a clean rider&amp;patience go hand in hand.

@bho27 @tom_dumoulin @JoeDombro Did he get it?
@timswim he's pretty stiff. Not sure he can go lower.
I'm going to brew up a Dutch oven in @tom_dumoulin's honor.
@Pflax1 DS school lesson #1: screaming on radio does not cure 'slow'
Will take a crash, mechanical, or a serious hunger flat for TD to lose. Think he's got it.
Most of the time in a very flat TT like this, the first time check is a solid indicator for the rest of the TT. The trend usually holds.
@Ride_Argyle literally and figuratively
@Ride_Argyle any update on #theracefor69?
Zakarin. This dude could spoil everyone's day.
@algatrensig Yes.
#fightforpink #69 #whowillendupontop? https://t.co/7jZf57GFGP
@Jake_H_B @daniellloyd1 1st and 2nd TT in GTs are different beasts.
Battle is on for place #69 in Giro. Will @Davide_villella be able to pass @JoeDombro  without both going "over the top" of @valerioconti93?
@martincov @davideformolo My dog gets meals served to her, gets to play fetch, and takes multiple naps every day. Hardly suffering.
@Jpstringer3 @daniellloyd1 Power/aerodynamic drag. Increase the numerator or decrease the denominator. Your choice.
@Cheapoflurane much better.
One thing is for sure, take away #poopgate and Dumoulin has this thing wrapped with a bow on top.
@Jpstringer3 @daniellloyd1 he will go quick too... yes, he could
Good to see @davideformolo in the top 10 on GC. He has suffered like hog on asphalt in the middle of July to make it happen. Chapeau.
Tomorrow will be interesting. Obvious pick is TD. However, I think Nibali, NQ, and Pinot will be quicker than many expect.
NQ just not able to keep going after accelerating.
@Chriskirkland36 @RichAdair üò¨
@LaCadenilla @juanauribep @mariagiraldo @CamiloMazuera Movistar tiene que hacer una carrera muy agresivo y r√°pido, TODO AL DIA! Si la etapa es suave, menos la subida al final, NQ no ganara mucho.
@LaCadenilla @juanauribep @mariagiraldo @CamiloMazuera Creo que Dumo no esta recuperando, d√≠a a d√≠a, a lo mismo nivel que NQ. Pero, NQ tiene que hacer su carrera ma√±ana, porque 38sec no llega.
Thing to think about, is historically, pure climbers, like NQ, always ride, relatively, much better in a stage 21 TT, than a stage 9 TT.
@RichAdair @vanillacyclist That's a little more his gig. But classics? No. no explosive power.
Marcie, our Lagotto Romagnolo, is cheering @davideformolo on!! She's a big fan. https://t.co/fOSBEYQ67E

@ramjet_roj @badbrainAJ @velocast @VelocastJohn @AshleyPresents That is about how it looked.
@RichAdair physiology not suited to that. In a lower pressure team, be great at weeklong races. He just has issues w glycogen around day 10.
With @realDonaldTrump meeting European leaders today, maybe it's time to revisit this: https://t.co/pmRLJI9eBy
Go @TejayVan ! Not on my team, but would be happy for him to win, if only to shut up all the idiots.
Super happy to see @JoeDombro coming good. He's had a rough ride this spring, but looks like the hard work finally paying off.
@ammattipyoraily climbers are all about training the ability to recycle lactate. Classics riders are all about training to buffer lactate.
@MrTesticles It's impossible to eat that much.  Your body uses fat stores and muscle tissue to create the extra needed energy.
@ammattipyoraily Yes. And Langevelde.
Pretty intense. Last 12 minutes averaged 440 watts. That's a hard thing to do after 200kms of battle. https://t.co/APPFEiwnUn
@rcousine @ednl @PierroooRolland did I delete that? Damn. I got a bit of guff from a longtime investor. So.... gotta respect that.
Most importantly, a really huge chapeau to @rusty_woods for playing a perfect tactical game behind. "Rook"might lose the nickname after that
What a strong ride. @PierroooRolland is such a strong athlete. Much more than most think.
üòâüòÅ
@rustingramm love the beard.
@saintlymark yeah. Good call.
NQ not really giving it full gas on the last few kms of uphill. Interesting.
Well, that's that.
Forza @Ride_Argyle @davideformolo!!! #Giro100 !! https://t.co/fzJGHR6FKh
@MikeFerrari4 I üíãdeadlifts.
Ok... tomorrow. Giro. Day after rest day always weird. Some guys bounce up. Some guys bounce down. Unpredictable. Movistar will go apeshit.
@DadBurnett7 @nealrogers Damn straight. Neal, let's go fishin.
@JoeTalknlots That's the idea behind the @HammerSeries of races. It's owned by the teams via Velon.
@fijiwriter best ever. Ever.
@JoeTalknlots I'm not prejudiced about it. I've brought more young Americans into the WT than anyone, ever. Works for some. Not for others.
@JoeTalknlots Selling sponsorship is like selling farts. Not many buyers.
@JoeTalknlots Well, typically, I'm the only guy out there that gives guys like that a shot. I can't do it for everyone, every year. Do my best.
@JoeTalknlots No idea what you're referring to. But simply put, just because you're a great bike rider in US races, doesn't mean anything in Europe.
@JoeTalknlots Probably. Specialized, 21st century Fox, etc...
@JoeTalknlots There are 17 other teams that can take him too. Wonder why everyone isn't falling all over themselves to get the deal done?
@TheRaceRadio looks just like the cover of Men's Fitness.
@logansowen here's another one for you: Someday, you'll win a stage of a GT. Maybe more. #nopressure
@Sameeto Who are the top commentators? Anyhow, NQ will come around in the longer, harder stages. Watch. Will it be enough? Who knows.
@rubenlampe partly cloudy with a 10% chance of Dumoulin.
@TweeterSagan @SC_Cycling well put.
@bernie_langer equities market value is predicated on farts&amp;butterflies right now. Bitcoin and Gold are good bets. Maybe a good quant fund.
@johnwbradley @nealrogers Low bar.
@ksbphoto Quintana is a real fighter.
Let me qualify that prediction... which is just a hunch... Quintana will be be much better in the multiple mountain stages later in the Giro
@ksbphoto Let me qualify this... I think Quintana will be much better on the multiple mountain stages later on.
@KathrynBertine @nealhenderson Larger issue here is that he was unable to shave this message in some proper chest hair.
Going to bed now.... But a little Giro prediction for tomorrow: Tom Dumoulin will be on par with Quintana, if not actually a bit better.
@Pflax1 vomit.
Big props to the @LottoJumbo_road tech development team. They have done super things with aerodynamics/overall speed the last few years.
@vanillacyclist Not the ones we are chasing.
@vanillacyclist so, your assessments are based on a guy who reads endemic cycling press every day. That's not going to get you any sponsor$$
@vanillacyclist let me give you some color as how non-endemic sponsors see this: 15mins in break one day in TdF=2x publicity of winning Giro
@vanillacyclist neither. Develop young riders. Be competitive and active in big races (i.e. - Monuments)
@vanillacyclist expectations? As the lowest budget/lowest rider payroll in WT+lowest median age: what, precisely are your expectations?
Ah.... was reading a feed and not at race. "Ouch" was thinking AT didn't get lead by a few secs. Now I see Bennett killed it. Congrats!!!
Ouch.
@nygaardbn not really. We have guys like Rigo, DVB, and Langevelde that are super in big races, but are not Sagan or Contador.
@nygaardbn lowest budget team in WT. Per UCI. So, if you mean pro conti teams, well, we try and chase big things, like Paris-Roubaix.
@DuffofBrentford @MichaelCarcaise @ammattipyoraily @WPalmerSport But: 5. This is purely intellectual exercise. Ain't gonna happen.
@DuffofBrentford @MichaelCarcaise @ammattipyoraily @WPalmerSport You could pay 100% of your budget to riders-might be tricky w no bus driver
@imdonncha @ammattipyoraily You can simply place a cap on overall budgets. Not define it as a salary cap.
@DuffofBrentford @MichaelCarcaise @ammattipyoraily @WPalmerSport Nah. Make it an overall budget cap. Doesn't limit salaries. Limits budget.
@ammattipyoraily 1. UCI and Aso actually agreeing with the concept (which they don't) 2. Some very heavy duty enforcement

@philgaimon Hah! Congrats!
@ulif @BI_Strategy The monuments and such don't need to be messed around with. Btw - I have a very good friend doing your event.
@ulif @BI_Strategy Oh, I just think the Velon format will work well in many 2.HC level events that are a bit lost right now.
@ulif @BI_Strategy almost on same page as you. Events like yours are the future. And a more sustainable and healthy future. Chapeau.
@philgaimon so, what was the Strava time?
Big hug to the Pitbull @andrewtalansky!
NICE!!!!!!
@TheNick777 When he's on form, and riding for GC, he doesn't. But putting all the elements together for PR is complex. Ain't no robot.
@ldbates For sure. But you'd be surprised with PR. His greatest strength is his ability to sit right below FTP for a looooong time.
Good news! ALL FIXED! https://t.co/u21rEJkMZW
After some negotiation, @PierroooRolland and I have agreed on this as his bonus for 3rd today: https://t.co/u0tcU5CLKI
@daniellloyd1 @Sameeto We've only been dating a few months tho?
357np for a 68kg rider. For the whole race. Hot damn! https://t.co/cux3hcEVm8
Allez @PierroooRolland !!!!
@CyclingHubTV so ridiculous. Farcical. Don't worry though, at some point they'll also motorpace the leaders.
@quambafu @Ride_Argyle No. I'm conveying reality. And what has been communicated to me.
@aedubs2 @lukascph @WestemeyerSusan Hi. My ex-wife(we are still friends) works for @DaVita ...Let me know if I can help.
Good news!! We have surgery figured out for Toms in the USA! Big thanks to all the @Ride_Argyle medical staff for figuring this out!!
@alex_howes Yes: wax.
@KurtLass1 @tednaiman so, you're saying my donut and ice cream sandwich routine may be the issue?
@steveathon Yes. Critical injuries aren't a problem. Clavicle surgery is just a bit of an oddity.
@daveno7 @jeremycwhittle @feria_sport already been done and in place.
@JeremySeysses quick! Send Dujac to ease the pain!
@albanegger critical injuries covered. Clavicle fracture under typical US health policy = will heal on its own w/o surgery.
@Blindside007 ummmm.... 7???  What are you doing to yourself???
@albanegger easy, tiger. Rider very much covered. However, collarbone surgery is not covered for anyone is USA. Do your research pre comment
@sprezaturra dude. Tell me about it.
@StalwartSt No, it all changes around w insurance in US when it's critical injury. Then they cover it. Collarbone not considered critical.
@kim_rub we do. The point is they'd rather fly him back to Europe business class, than get the surgery done is USA.
Conversation with our team doctor re surgery on Toms collarbone. Highlights the extreme expense of US healthcare. https://t.co/usZ5SKDQem
@Trudgin he was pissed off. Not me.
#ouch https://t.co/X4fBSY9bhD
Had a short chat with @Tomashuuns.... disappointed, but in good spirits. He's with team medical staff in annoyingly long wait at San Jose ER
Will update everyone on Toms when I know more. Prelim reports it seems he's ok. But quite pissed off that he had to stop.
Message finally conveyed to DS. Thank you. I'm in a car park with team busses. No TV. No cell coverage up where race was.
Everyone: appreciate the messages regards Toms. I am not in team car and cell coverage limited.
@nealrogers @jalarandiga And spank you, Neal.
@DPLeatherwood @businessinsider Worldwide audience. Not just USA.
@ammattipyoraily Dumoulin will be considerably quicker on Tuesday. His weakness lies in stages with multiple mountains and deep in 3rd week.
@sjoerdth @davideformolo should be, yes.
Grandi @davideformolo !!!
Pffffft.... that's just crap. #Giro100
@LucasJaxion @philgaimon #fakenews
@Ben_M_Berry @philgaimon Viagra.
@philgaimon People gotta be angry about something.
@Ben_M_Berry @philgaimon pulp. I like things a little dirty.
@philgaimon bahhh!!! Any talk outside of yelling a political stance that most of your followers already agree with is banned these days.
@CaoimhinV2 yes. Absolutely. But my coaching with Pierre has all been about raising his cadence. Naturally he likes 65-75.
@CaoimhinV2 his average cadence was 84 for the whole of the climb.
@lafiammarossa sure. I just followed.
@JohnKerry Nice to see you back in action, old friend.

@joelindsey Thoughts and Prayers for your '91 Subaru.
@faldinsky_jon ...in isolation, it seems reasonable. But this isn't in isolation.
@TweeterSagan conflicted feelings.
@vivavelo @cyclingmoron @iamjensee That's it. I've just never seen a WH that just doesn't care about optics. At all.
@bobbierman right. That's pretty much it. Damn.
Whoa. #Comey fired. What was the official reason given? Am I wrong to view this as deeply concerning?
Phew. Looks like Macron won. All political opinions aside: Sanity wins. Barely. Yay.
@jwcraw Formolo is the GC guy. We just didn't overtly state that before the start to keep pressure off the kid from Italian media.
@jwcraw No GC ambitions. Never were any. 3rd week, mountain stages.
@VeganCyclist @micacquarone Cultures are not all the same in their phraseology and translation. Michele is a very respectful and good person.
@VeganCyclist @micacquarone I know Michele. Very well. If the words were wrong (in your opinion) then its an English as a 3rd language thing, not a sexist thing.
@VeganCyclist I think my point; certainly that of @micacquarone (who is suing RCS for defamation,Giro, as we speak) was that the suit was in poor taste.
@VeganCyclist Finding humor in the foibles of human anatomy, irregardless of gender, is humanistic, in the most Marquis de Sade sense.
@VeganCyclist let's be clear, I'm married to someone who taught women's studies at university. So, I'm not ignorant to your thinking.
@VeganCyclist no. You got me to not want to get into a public food fight. That doesn't mean you changed my thinking.
@VeganCyclist Or speech.... oops.
@VeganCyclist don't believe that for a second. First you get someone to listen. Second you *try* and get them to agree. #freespeach.
Congrats @Aevolo_Cycling, @Michael_Creed and my fellow Aspen flight school buddy @GageHecht ...
@VeganCyclist Be aware: knee jerk reactions like you just had are what cause moderates to quietly refute the good causes you believe in.

@AmourDeVelo @rusty_woods @dzabriskie ....erm..
@rusty_woods Man, all I did was google "Canadian tuxedo 69" and boom! Larry Enticer. A treasure trove of video entertainment.
@Ride_Argyle @rusty_woods Don't worry, it won't take long to get there with #69!!!
@JoeDombro @rusty_woods And #Rusty. Let's not forget that we can integrate that.
Congrats to @rusty_woods for being #69 in the #100giro... A lifelong dream for most riders.
Super grateful to @bonappetit and @AndrewOKnowlton for hosting me at BA HQ! Test kitchen in the sky! https://t.co/TuvqT6hCLQ
@Surlyviking @richardmoore73 @lionelbirnie @friebos He's been great ever since the electroshock therapy. Isn't that right, Hugh?
@joelindsey problem in road racing is minimal protective gear, cars/motors all over the place, unknown road conditions, dogs off leash...
@joelindsey I mean, a stand alone competition on descending, like in MTB, would be fine. Could be a clean course, extra protective gear etc.
@joelindsey sort of like the Hunger Games or what?
@joelindsey And now it's cancelled. I mean, it's like they never asked a rider "hey, what do you think?".... oh. Right. They never have.
@SciGuySpace yeah. That sucks.

@baacanty @tacx @GoZwift So, what you're saying is that it's got a vibrator built in to it.
@alexroseinnes @jeromepugmire exactly.
@luke_beatty @jeromepugmire So does Jerome!
@PodiumCafe @jeromepugmire Not claiming to be super cool or whatever.
@PodiumCafe @jeromepugmire In Nov 2015? No. more than 2.
@alexroseinnes @jeromepugmire Thanks, man. But this wasn't IQ. This was not spending all my time in LA and NYC.
No, @jeromepugmire, it's not that I'm smart, it's that I spent a lot of time talking to a lot of different people. https://t.co/9aodKZSZdu
The risk of this best descender thing isn't at the front of race. You won't see it on TV. It's 2 guys 25minutes behind that cage match it.
@CaleyFretz @realDonaldTrump She can always just teach the class how to gild tables, chairs, ceilings, buildings etc. Useful skillz nowadays
@giroditalia now *that* is a great thing to do. The best descender thingy....erm...less of a great thing.
@TheeSloog I are not know!!
@TheBoulderSC you an yer big werds.
@TheBoulderSC careful. I will grab your handles and deadlift you.

@festinaboy Ma petit chou...
@craiglewis85 erm... you weren't lucky. But then, maybe you were lucky? Some of the most vivid memories I have.
@danmaize That's what makes a true, top level, pro cyclist. Fearless, focused, and mean. Physical talent is just one small component.
@danmaize no. You either want it or you want a fluffy tofu lifestyle.
@danmaize guys who race domestic US  scene tend to have great numbers and no toughness. Vis-a-versa is true elsewhere.
@danmaize both.
Rest In Peace, @chadwyoung
@luke_beatty Glad my parents didn't hold me to that standard! #orphan
@IlCobra21 @camille_9191 Kevin is one cool cat. He won't let it bother him.
@dbrabyn of course it is! But core/engaged audience is people who ride bikes a bit. At least in the USA.
Prayers for @chadwyoung... cycling is such a beautiful sport. But it is a sport for true warriors - unafraid - as it is horribly dangerous.
https://t.co/BhF28lANze
The old expression:  "You catch more flies with honey than vinegar".... I don't want to catch flies.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine There also might be a perception diff due to average IQ of running/cycling fan vs average IQ of NFL fan!?hah!
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine Then I misread your argument. Apologies.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine WADA controls antidoping in endurance(3rd party). NFL/MLB internally.Hence less transparency ergo less uproar
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine I doubt that's accurate. Public perceives it as different because punitive consequences greater in endurance.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine Fair enough. But basic premise is that it's somehow a 'lessor' offense for MLB/NFL; advantage isn't as great
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine arguing that it's somehow quantifiably lessor is speculative at best, perhaps wrong/opposite at worst.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine Conversely, just like steroids won't give you hand/eye to hit a ball,EPO won't give you mitochondrial density
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine Just a different form of perf enhancement that takes body beyond its natural capacity.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine By reducing injuries, Mark Maguire gains the similar level of perf gain as runner increasing red cell mass.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine Just like having high mitochondrial density is a natural selection parameter for endurance sports.
@fritzvsfritz @outsidemagazine article misses very fundamental issues. Huge gap: Being injury prone or not is a form of natural selection.
Apparently we have a new sponsor? I wonder if it's cash or product only? @FloydLeadville https://t.co/JYKGaAcrUU

@Cyclocosm that math stopped working a decade ago, man.
Shit. RIP Scarpa.
@adrianartn @hrhagman @PWCycling @ednl @civetta Which would be a good place to start. But hey, ASO don't like my crazy ideas much.
@PWCycling @ednl @civetta Just to be clear AIGCP and Velon totally different things.
@PWCycling @ednl @civetta Yeah, sort of. But 20 rider cut?! Seems extreme.
@ednl @PWCycling @civetta I'm not into circus races. AIGCP isn't really involved in that. But ASO trying circus out for future? Bingo.
@kenem @AlasSchouten It's called the "reverse motor" nowadays, Ken.
@AlasSchouten Just wait until the Giro. We are gonna really screw over Hugh. Ain't that right @kenem !?
@lukascph @Tomek_Bojan @faustocoppi60 @Cyclingnewsfeed Correct. Need Pizza and beer money, right? (not that Eddy Merckx would eat pizza or drink beer)
@Tomek_Bojan @faustocoppi60 @Cyclingnewsfeed Yay! Go Valverde! He's the kinda guy I want Formolo to look up to!
@Tomek_Bojan @faustocoppi60 @Cyclingnewsfeed Yes, and Eddy Merckx would do the same. Maybe even do a Kermesse on Saturday, just to keep the legs rolling over.
@faustocoppi60 @Cyclingnewsfeed me too #kinky
https://t.co/H7ZIg0adIT I understand why race org would be upset. Solution? Strategic+unified calendar of races -Not current overbooked mess

@IlCobra21 it was a bit messy. Problem is just that all the guys are a bit short on confidence after a tough March. But that will change.
Going to bed now. But will I sleep? I don't know. I'm nervous, apprehensive, and very optimistic about how @Ride_Argyle will do tomorrow.
Can I hear some noise for @rusty_woods tomorrow??!!!
@jasongay mine was a joke too. Damn Twitter.
@jasongay Yes, putting rainbows and unicorns in photos really is the equivalent to when humans first achieved flight.
@kylelm be down there this weekend.
@IamAuntieEm @anitabfranklin The guy(legend) to talk to is @joaoisme. Or maybe @davideformolo if he's not busy racing @TourOfTheAlps

Had a super fun dinner with two of my heroes and absolute legends last night: Steve Ells of @ChipotleTweets and Daniel Kessler of @Interpol
@Ride_Argyle 5 riders then.
@Ride_Argyle @Tomashuuns So, it's a 4 man break. As Toms has the strength of two men - and is plural.
@JoeDombro @PierroooRolland Oil? Did somebody say oil? https://t.co/HbVtNwZPjG
@Basementbiker yeah! He was super into it. Super knowledgeable. Really good guy. Great prostate massage too.
....The best part was a massive @Ride_Argyle fan giving me pat down. #TSA superfan!
Had to explain to TSA dude at airport that despite Sep being out we have options. Big ones. Don't make me explain it to you too. #vanbaarle
@richwag @heyapm I don't think he was being serious.
@bikebill Yes. Agree. However, to avoid seeming disingenuous, it's best to address an obvious elephant in the room up front.
RIP Steve Tilford. Guy hated my guts, but nonetheless, I respected him. Watched and idolized him at '86 worlds. He was pioneer of US cycling
@jerrylweiss @9NEWS Thanks!
@ammattipyoraily anecdotally, I think you are correct.
@ammattipyoraily micro accelerations.
@IlCobra21 Coppi, Merckx, Hinault. All long femur/short tibia.
@IlCobra21 there is also some evidence that long femur/short tibia riders produce more power per liter of o2. But may only be sub 85rpm.
@IlCobra21 No, anquetil had long femurs which also, incidentally, provide an aerodynamic advantage; your knees don't come as high pedaling
@IlCobra21 and since everyone was on a 42x23 bottom gear back then, lower rpm was common.
@IlCobra21 yes, but Moser had bio mechanic limitations; longer tibia to shorter femur allowed him less quadriceps leverage at low rpm.
@TommySingo is that English? Anyhow, now that we have the test scores in, I can say you do not meet the minimum IQ to be in my feed: blocked
@TommySingo The DS was Sep's brother, asshole.
@Adriftinthewood @JuSummerhayes @TourDeJose ah. Yes. Exactly.
@Adriftinthewood @JuSummerhayes @TourDeJose In men's WT, yes, that is a limiting factor. WWT hasn't reached that point yet. But it will.
@Adriftinthewood @JuSummerhayes @TourDeJose Absolutely. Takes an initial venture investment in event/media. Then audience rises=sponsors.
@Adriftinthewood @JuSummerhayes @TourDeJose Sponsorships are sold on ability to reinforce brand and eventually increase sales of product.
@Adriftinthewood @JuSummerhayes @TourDeJose It's just a numbers game. Audience numbers for racing and behind the scenes content.
@Al__S @TourDeJose Not the point.Those teams have commercial/personal interest in doing so.If it's compulsory, then adjustments must be made
@JuSummerhayes @TourDeJose Very true. We worked 18months on funding a great women's team in 2011. Absolutely no interest in marketplace.
@TommySingo @Cyclingnewsfeed You're kind of an idiot if you think that's how it works.
@PsycleFan it's uncircumcised excellence in film making.
@MartinLarner @CaleyFretz yep. That's the problem.
@MartinLarner @CaleyFretz ..yeah, but it's faster over there.
@faldinsky_jon @BobMalfliet @petosagan @DylanvanBaarle I doubt it. When we do recon barriers aren't there. Crowds arent there.
@TourDeJose Not all of us can afford that. But, as long as that regulation comes with spending/budget caps for WT teams, I would support it.
‚Äú@CaleyFretz: As a sort of random aside, if they moved the barriers 5 inches further in then the fastest line is on the crown. Voil√°.‚Äù Bingo
@flammecast @DylanvanBaarle That's it. It's just a choice. Sometimes risk pays. Sometimes it doesn't. That's why it's called risk.
@BobMalfliet @petosagan The risk is the barriers and crowd. Jackets and all. If you want to avoid risk, stay in the middle. Riders know.
see 10 seconds earlier, @DylanvanBaarle decides to take a more conservative line. Loses speed. But stays upright. It's a gamble either way.
Debate on if @petosagan at fault in #RVV crash. Riding far to side is calculated risk; smoother cobbles. 80% of time it works. Not this time
@PsycleFan you gotta watch the video! It's freaking hilarious.
@PKCampbell78 @DylanvanBaarle @NikiTerpstra I appreciate you being a fan! But Niki really had no choice in that situation. To be fair.
Maybe overkill..but reason I'm proud of @DylanvanBaarle ride today is he cd have sat on/raced for 2nd in final;He raced to catch Gilbert+win
.@DylanvanBaarle is the first rider I started personally training 2yrs ago. So, even though I prayed for more, today is a happy day for me.
Super nice ride by @DylanvanBaarle... He raced with honor - and each year he gets a little better and a little closer to the win.
Nice work by good ol' @rusty_woods at GP Indurain today, eh?!

@Ted_Arnold @TheRaceRadio oooof.... so true.
@mathis_todd wouldn't know. Wasn't invited.
@TomsHomeCookin I know what you regret: depriving Denver of good fried Catfish!
@Bearlinner let's talk about boners instead!
I'm no body language expert... but if I were, my read on Comey today was he has a lot of regret over something in the past.
@TheRaceRadio Klassy.
@DrMarkBurnley @Scienceofsport @Joe684 Thats why we clipped the pulse ox directly to their frontal lobe. Improved the riders' mood too.
@Cheapoflurane @Scienceofsport New target testing method.
@Cheapoflurane @Scienceofsport *that* can cause boners too. Explains a few things for me.
@Cheapoflurane @Scienceofsport That's pretty much it. Somehow you still have clarity at much higher intensity.
@Scienceofsport will read. The interesting question in this is: How do you overcome this limitation? More impt: Should you want to overcome?
@Cheapoflurane @Scienceofsport I can tell you one thing, for certain: o2 vector doping stuff makes you way more tactically astute.
@Scienceofsport Not certain. I'd have to ask the guy who did it in our athletes. maybe we just clipped a pulse ox to their brain intranasal?
@Joe684 @Scienceofsport You stop going fast.
@Scienceofsport Found same some 10yrs ago, while doing ramp power tests. Brain o2 sat increased until ~1min pre failure. Then dropped fast
@oufeh increased Hb mass (i.e. protein mass) leads to greater acid buffering capacity. Independent of o2 delivery advantages.
@Ride_Argyle @AlbertoBettiol looks more like "proud as pizza"....
@TheRaceRadio obvious pick rarely wins MSR. The winner is always someone who "seems obvious" in retrospect.

@TeamBrioschi @HammerSeries long story on that.
@TeamBrioschi @HammerSeries I think the greater win here is that you're engaged in figuring out these issues, just like I'll be.
@JoeDombro @matthewcbeaudin @KevmoBikes @TheBoulderSC @alex_howes That's what I mean! If Daimo had handles, I could do it.

@TheBoulderSC @alex_howes Just need to get a solid grip.
@bluetucker @inrng what??! You don't like 24/7 meltdowns over politics, like everyone else?
@inrng You can claim hype, but Velon is breaking even. Teams haven't provided VC in over 30 months. That *is* unprecedented in cycling.
@jmaher92 @Trudgin @HammerSeries Just to clear one thing up: Velon isn't exclusive. Those teams can join. They don't due to ASO fear.
@festinagirl @HammerSeries same backbone, yes. But more refined and with new ideas implanted.
For those curious about why the @hammerseries is unique: It's racing designed for the riders and the fans by the riders and the teams.

@BobbitJ @oufeh @agibby76 @Digger_forum #cojones
@BobbitJ @oufeh @agibby76 as I told @Digger_forum once: Bet u $100,000 that that Giro will always b shown to be a clean win. Same open to u.
@BobbitJ @oufeh @agibby76 Yes.
@BobbitJ @oufeh @agibby76 F+
@agibby76 @Hiltaldo @ColinASturgess I fit within this category better than I fit within my trousers.
@H_Olli @agibby76 Kenacort is easily detected. Therefore, in order to consume it, requires a significant medical paper trail. So, yeah, 100%
@liquidmedia2013 Right. Yeah. That.
@agibby76 @ColinASturgess You both seem like genuinely good people. I really do wish you a happy new year. Peace.
@agibby76 because I've seen the blood records(which are public, btw) and I've seen the WADA files. Pretty straightforward.
@agibby76 absolutely proud. That Giro was won 100% clean. And history will always show that to be true.
@agibby76 Brad is a great talent and a great athlete. No doubt. Huge motor. But he needs to step up and own this one. I hope he will.
@agibby76 yeah. Pretty much. One day those stories will be told. But not today. Happy New Year. I'm done.
@agibby76 but I can say, with 100% certainty, while with us, there were no Kenacort bombs. Thankfully.
@agibby76 but that's not the point. Point is a big shot of Kenacort 3 days before a GT 3 years in a row; that's as old school as it gets.
@agibby76 I hope not. But Brad did his own thing. By mid 2009, he was very chummy with Lance and well on his way out of our team.
@agibby76 agreed. Entirely.
@mikeroecklein erm... wasn't meant to be.
@AdsCondron @oufeh @agibby76 correct. Jiffy bag isn't the issue here.
@liquidmedia2013 it's actually a very healthy thing to consume when under high stress. It's a super powerful anti-oxidant.
@liquidmedia2013 probably 100%.
@JeroenSwart @ianrobo1 Good ol' Tudor Bompa!
Them panties, take 'em off. https://t.co/8cBt6qoIBc ?..Love the Holidays at the airport! So much so, I decided to film my TSA experience!
@Andyc32 @agibby76 The Kenacort injections were confirmed by Wiggins and DB. That's the only info I'm referring to in fancy bears.
@WESchottIII @ianrobo1 @JeroenSwart Got it. Thank you.
@agibby76 I would have thought the exact same thing. Until I read the Fancy Bears hack. That changed my thinking. Sadly.
@veloclinic @JeroenSwart Yep.
@agibby76 And all I said was that contamination risk of fluimucil would be as low or lower in France.
@WESchottIII @ianrobo1 @JeroenSwart sorry, I don't quite follow?
@ianrobo1 @JeroenSwart struggle in coaching: how do you get an athlete light, able to use lipids as fuel, yet still fire up glycolysis?
@agibby76 Listen, you can make this personal, nasty, and biased, if you like. That's your choice. I just gave you facts. Very simple.
@agibby76 btw - your jab there just indirectly threw your hero, Wiggins, under the bus. Gotta be careful with that.
@agibby76 really? Maybe you need to re-read the sequence of events a little more. But whatever. Believe what you want. #UKfluimucil
@JeroenSwart They do now. But after a few years of CHO restriction, takes a while to unwind.
@ianrobo1 @JeroenSwart GTs are won and lost in little 4 minute periods. Glycolytic capacity very important.
@Andyc32 @agibby76 Fluimucil? Buy locally. Have for years. It's a very useful anti-oxidant and decongestant.
@JeroenSwart @spragg247 Yep. It's a bummer.
@agibby76 Yes. Exactly. I've been first hand witness and participant. Gives me perspective as to what's actually happening. #nicetry
@JeroenSwart Having now coached a few riders that were previously on CHO restricted type training regimes, it hurts glycolytic power a lot.
@JeroenSwart @spragg247 Unfortunately, cycling is in the other10%.
@JeroenSwart @spragg247 Yeah, that is nuts. But it's a WADA code thing-Looking at 300+sports where 90% would show 0 benefit frm corticos
@JeroenSwart hah! No. Just didn't have a fancy name and wasn't as refined.
@JeroenSwart conversely, high volume, lower intensity, and (most importantly)constantly starving themselves would feel corticos helped a lot
@JeroenSwart makes sense. My observation was riders who trained high intensity/low volume/high carb benefitted very little from corticos.
@JeroenSwart But, I really only thought through this very recently. So, my anecdotal data is a bit old!!!
@JeroenSwart an anecdotal observation from racing in 90s, that riders who trained large volume+carb restricted, benefited greater.
@JeroenSwart ok, so would high doses of exogenous cortisone correct this neg effect of CHO restricted training?
@JeroenSwart Checking my logic: In a CHO restricted diet training regime, athletes tend to lose glycolytic capacity+capacity access glycogen
@agibby76 @Rockybucket Please. Fluimucil is manufactured in the same labs, worldwide. Risk of contamination probably higher in UK.
@richwag oh, they may be onto something. We will see...Just it won't have anything to do with Ryder.
@ChadJHolt @BisoBus @ryder_hesjedal Millennials don't know these tricks. It's sad.
https://t.co/PNPZWA7uCC ...This bring back memories. Like the time @BisoBus had to use jumper cables to get @ryder_hesjedal's motor started.
@thinkingthari Respectfully, you would have no idea whether I do or don't do that; I don't. Period. Maybe consider taking that at face value
@JeroenSwart Astute observation with a reasonable probability of actually occurring.
@thinkingthari How do you come up with that conclusion regarding someone you've never spoken to or met?

@Digger_forum @stevechapman65 I have no ability to say with 100% certainty that any rider is clean or not. I do trust some. But that's faith
@MartyGT80 @Digger_forum of course it's wrong. But it's fact.
@Digger_forum @stevechapman65 Ok guys. Ignore the facts and retweet each other. Got it. Very politician like of you. I need to excuse myself
@Digger_forum Yes. Thank you for publishing this to correctly prove my point.
@stevechapman65 @Digger_forum You guys should go read for yourself. Much simpler than asking me.
@stevechapman65 @Digger_forum Not regards an OOC, no. In comp, sure, or 3 OOC ADRV. But not OOC. The rules are published for all to read.
@stevechapman65 @Digger_forum Correct. And then athlete is informed by IF. But not team managers. Or teams.
@stevechapman65 @Digger_forum The athlete is the only one informed of missed OOC. Unless there are 3 OOC, which constitutes an ADRV.
@Digger_forum Let's be very clear: I don't think he had any missed OOC with us; under WADA code(public info)he didn't have to inform us.

@theEditSmith @chris_robison was not meant to be harsh; don't appreciate being told "pay x more b/c he got more publicity that ur team."
@theEditSmith @chris_robison Yes. Agreed. I'm not at all against publicity via Strava. It's good for business. But it ain't real racing.
@OwenRogers pizza. Definitely.
@Rondo2 right. That would create a truly crazy RE market indeed.
@KenatGV no more sitting on your hands!!!
@Rondo2 Interesting!
@KenatGV right.The infrastructure spend (if it happens) would be very inflationary, eventually, but now it's tickling equities the right way
@DabberMatt like that.... what people think people think will happen. Well said.
@rhult13 yeah yeah. I get that. It's just that nothing has actually happened yet. And I know markets are anticipatory. Still,seems premature
@DabberMatt yeah, that's what I figured. But we don't know if ANY of that will actually happen. Hence my confusion.
@JGrantis yeah... but I'd say we are about to go into a more inflationary environment.
Anyone care to explain the exuberance of the equities markets to me? Im genuinely curious.
@JoeDombro Man, your coach is psychotic.
@Greg_Connolly @PaulKimmage Actually, I'd consider Paul on the top of that list. Friend and mentor.
@lionelbirnie @friebos Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Lionel.
One thing I realized this last week: Some of my best friends and people I admire the most in cycling are the journalists that cover sport.
@lionelbirnie @friebos I didn't mock it! Said it makes it complicated. Which I also said to Velon, however: Genius is always mocked at first
https://t.co/6Y0Ne3u4wP ... Really unfortunate. And an excellent example of why cycling must rethink how it treats its teams/athletes.
@SenatorBrophy BS. You just miss watermelon genocide.

@OzzieDNelson @nyCasey @nytimes Yeah, I don't know. Being married to a millennial+having one as a son, I'd say disinterest is ++ causative
@russ_boom @nedboulting I really hope you don't think that US businesses that do 90% of work outside US(cycling)are not impacted in some way
@OzzieDNelson @nyCasey @nytimes Yes. I have my personal opinion of CK as well. But that's got nothing to do with this article, really.
@russ_boom @nedboulting And the last time you were overseas? This has nothing to do with "woe is me" ..I'm fine. Bigger issue.
@russ_boom @nedboulting Think you missed the point. I was simply saying people feel awkward and concerned re USA abroad(EU).
.@nyCasey @nytimes My fav part of this article  are the comments on Twitter. Not a single one even remotely constructive or thoughtful.
@alex_howes @rusty_woods rubber side down, Mike. Always. Rubber side down...
@joeparkin yes. Like that.
@JOSHUAKOHEL Overseas
@iancleverly @nedboulting bahhh!!!
@nedboulting Don't take it wrong, you guys were all great. Just feels odd being the American in the room nowadays!
My first social night out abroad after the US election. Feels like getting condolences post funeral.
@johnwbradley read that a few times. Still working on comprehending it.
@Velocentric @vayerism He was hot like bacon! Looked just like Zab.
@dodgex2000 @sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine Yes. Intelligence and credibility with the riders. Both of which are hard to find.
@BobbitJ @SSbike @TeamSky @Ty_Hamilton Yes, we've been in touch. Quite a bit in 2012, 2013. He's far from unwelcome in my little circus.
@alex_howes @rusty_woods Mike, have we not learned our lessons yet?
@carlabond It means you may stand a better chance of translating what the Swedish Chef is singing on the Muppet Show.
@fredfalcone @veloclinic @sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine getting in a bar fight. Just ask the doc.
@veloclinic @sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine idk, sounds like that could lead to an acute breakdown of my ideology.

@veloclinic @sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine Only if you can tell me the magic way to lose kgs, reduce inflammation, and access +energy.
@janibrajkovic @veloclinic @sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine 3 point swish for Jani.
@veloclinic @sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine Yes. But only pork rinds and tequila.
@sportspeye @oufeh @pelotonmagazine Fact: We hired Sky's head of nutrition in late 2015. Nigel Mitchell. So, cut the BS on us being 'behind'
@philgaimon who is this Sasquatch fellow you keep giving the stick to?
@Rbl85Remy @brucetramp It's not a nationality thing. I guarantee ASO led the charge. But that's not because they are French.
@TomsHomeCookin @Millerlite40 That and he's the only athlete I know that got busted for providing a "non-human" urine sample.
@cyclingfans man. That sounds ominous.
@MerelyDarren they know. And they do not care. At all.
@inrng @RichardPlugge @UCI_cycling... oh man. I would laugh if not for the crying.
@RichardPlugge another F-ing war over stupidity and hubris. Kills me.
I don't disagree with the concept of smaller teams. But letting us know AFTER our planning and rosters are well in motion...Not considerate!
So nice of ASO to give teams+riders a heads up on their unilateral decision to reduce team size 2mos before season. https://t.co/RCZpBZaeNU

@toddhowman don't hold your breath. I'm a small player no one listens to.
@ulif @toddhowman Yeah. I like your work. Think it's a really good thing. No qualifications.
@cyclistdata @master__flahute and finally; spinning? Please. I've got no need to spin anything to 2 guys on twitter. Or to anyone.
@cyclistdata @master__flahute studies re long term benefits of peds are focused on androgen/anabolics, which makes sense. Epo does not.
@cyclistdata @master__flahute I wouldn't say he had the same upside potential. And sorry, I don't agree w "epo has benefits yrs later".
@toddhowman for me, @ulif style events are future of US racing; with better talent ID component and focus on u23s that can one day do TdF.
@toddhowman stand alone events/teams won't work in increasing globalized economy. Assuming that trend prevails.
@toddhowman If US scene is to be successful, needs to draw a line from it to the Tour de France. Like AA baseball to World Series.
@toddhowman Needs new paradigm. A big blob of unrelated races all year with minimal media coverage isn't going to cut it.
@b_r_e_t_t @cyclistdata Super big motor tho. Just euro peloton bike handing skills are hard to pick up late in career.
@b_r_e_t_t @cyclistdata TZ was suspended for 2 years. Said he was quitting. Came back, 33y old. Too old to learn euro style peloton.
@toddhowman @cyclingtips have not read it. Link?
@master__flahute @cyclistdata That's it.
@adpilling1 @thomasdekker if that's your perspective, yes, you are an idiot. Read the book.
@cyclistdata win big races. He had the motor. I felt I could revive the motivation. #fail
@cyclistdata nope. Good guy. But his problems pretty much killed his drive.
@cyclistdata he scored 0.
@cyclistdata TD was UCI minimum.  Neo pro wage.
@cyclistdata apart, I felt it was hypocritical he was cast aside, when many others, much worse, were still racing. Bleeding heart and such.
@cyclistdata Dekker had massive talent. Doping aside. Calculated risk. High risk. Had he been dedicated 100%, he could have been a BIG rider
@BobbitJ @thomasdekker oh, I'm probably not going to read it. But I'm looking fwd to people's feedback on what it says about his time w us.
@BobbitJ @thomasdekker fund what?
@BobbitJ @thomasdekker anyhow, TD has every reason to trash talk me, but I'm pretty sure he didn't. Because we were and are different.
@BobbitJ @thomasdekker hah! That's the reason I've never written a book, but in reverse.
@BobbitJ @thomasdekker why don't you read his book and see if I missed anything?
Good to see @thomasdekker has a new book out. I look forward to people reading about how different our team was compared to Rabobank.

@thechainstay A roll up! Like your thinking. Quite a few hurdles tho. And been tried (failed)...TdF would probably cost $250M.
@thechainstay It's not an easy solution. That's for sure.
@thechainstay Correct. Races hold almost all.
@thechainstay To say there's been no attempt at investing-a bit insulting.Tinkov, Gerry Ryan,Andy Riis.These guys spent MM hoping for equity
@thechainstay 365d washing machine eliminates the possibility of building equity. Therefore, there are no investors in cycling. Only donors.
@thechainstay At some point you have to create the possibility of equity. Or you'll never have investors. Arbitrary timing? Sure.

@bjbbiker üò≤üî´
@SimoneWarner what??!! Noooo... Can't be true.
@nyCasey They robots won't feel tannins. They won't.
@RickyCadel95 but hey, fundamentally, I would care if that's what I thought UCI was doing. I just try to worry about my own team's arse!
@RickyCadel95 what you aren't seeing is that ASO controls cycling. That's my point. It's not anti ASO. It's just a simple fact.
@RickyCadel95 additionally, I don't really care why the UCI proposed more teams. But I do know ASO would never have accepted it, normally...
@RickyCadel95 ok. Well, I disagree. But that's not because of the article. It's from watching the UCI fight for more teams for years.
@RickyCadel95 don't take it so personally. I'm just telling you what I think.
@RickyCadel95 listen, I give my opinion on things. It's based on my observation now and from my years as AIGCP President.
@kevlott agree with that. Mostly.
@TommySmo carries debt and no longer growing equity.
@JessiBraverman ....did someone say HJ?
@mikefagan_ibc Yep.
@Phil13A @derekbarlas oversimplification. And not applicable to a sport that teams receive $0 from media rights, ticket sales...
@pricey_88 @derekbarlas üòç
@derekbarlas most EPL franchises carry tons of debt.
@mads_dw @lukascph Mads! You are welcome on my timeline any day! Refreshing someone who has studied this so well!
@lukascph @mads_dw Maybe the motivation and drama should be to win the rankings? Not 'don't finish 18th'...
.@lukascph And IF only company in cycling wealthy enough(ASO)to financially support a team post relegation(lost sponsors)would do it, I'm in
@buysheep If golden parachute is there, you are right. Then you get the chance to climb back up. But no one is paying for that in cycling.
@lukascph YES! You nailed it.
@lukascph yes. Sorry, should have been more precise.
@lukascph @joepabike I've held this view for a very long time. But I certainly was once ignorant to what a pain in arse current system is.
@lukascph Bahrain could have sponsored Tinkov. Hansgrohe/Specialized could have sponsored IAM.
Sports leagues that do not carry $$$$$ in debt, that are financially stable, and that have growing equity value DO NOT HAVE RELEGATION.
Everybody:The debate shouldn't be about if current points system is good @ determining 18th place.Debate shd be about why relegation at all?
@JamieGMac F yeah!
@ednl @RickyCadel95 unfortunately, more likely.
.@RickyCadel95 I think DD should NEVER have been at risk of being relegated. ‚Ç¨2M hopefully made ASO think twice about abusing their monopoly
@RickyCadel95 but was not representative of their position.
@RickyCadel95 Considerably more complex negotiation. That draft was in hopes ASO would accept a compromise of less/longer.
@fueledbymetal1 @BenKing89 of course! I am!
@StephanvdZwan @NoMapNoCompass @UCI_cycling @ProCyclingStats almost. But, for me, functions more accurately.
@RickyCadel95 UCI has always pushed for more teams (18+) and longer licenses. ASO has always pushed for fewer teams and shorter licenses.
@NoMapNoCompass yeah. So, use the @ProCyclingStats one. Much better.
CEO DiData: Wait... So you're telling me you ram rodded the rule through that's getting us booted out? PRUDHOMME: .... CEO DiData: ....
@wbradfordw @TeamDiData well, that, also, is quite obvious!
@PauldeHaas1 if your little brain can't follow the meaning of the comment please don't follow. Don't want you to strain yourself thinking.
@janusbasnov @joepabike yeah. Like the current @ProCyclingStats ranking. I agree.
@joepabike no. It sucks balls. And really hurts sponsorship.
Further clarify: I think DD is awesome! But I do find it funny when ASO arm twists UCI for 'relegation' &amp; then get caught in their own trap!
@Stedonly ASO has been pushing for 'relegation' for ages. I find it funny when they get caught in their own bear trap. Ouch!
@Cheapoflurane Yes. Just like in the movie Deliverance, when they are asked nicely to "squeal like a pig"....
@Stedonly No. I think they should have stuck with 18 to begin with. This is just comedy, that's all.
@cobbledClassic hah! Funny. Yes, it is UCI's choice....As long as the UCI is ok having a WT with zero ASO races. (So, no, not really)
@cobbledClassic UCI always wanted 18 teams. 20, in fact. ASO always pushes for fewer teams...always...except in this one instance. Hmmmm...
@luke_beatty You mean, pay us ‚Ç¨2M and you can be ranked dead last, but we still won't boot you out of WT? No; I imagine it cd be worked out!
To be clear, I applaud decision to stay w 18 teams. That said, any other team &amp; would have been"tough shit, kiddo!" https://t.co/LApqVRSX9Y
@pcxmo that would fall into the 'bullshit walks' section.

@BobbitJ @lukascph @festinagirl @dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms for sure. But less pain doesn't always=faster. Sounds counterintuitive, I know.
@lukascph @festinagirl @BobbitJ @dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms yep.
@lukascph @festinagirl @BobbitJ @dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms correct.
@daveno7 @festinagirl @BobbitJ @dimspace @lukascph @SSbike @Velorooms If you can't fight with bazookas, use squirt guns instead.
@BobbitJ @lukascph @festinagirl @dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms exactly.
@lukascph @festinagirl @BobbitJ @dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms not sure it makes you faster(unlike cortisone)..But ban it for consistency sake
@lukascph @festinagirl @BobbitJ @dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms Yes. It should banned. No extra cost at all. Cd be found in current tests.
@festinagirl @BobbitJ @dimspace @lukascph @SSbike @Velorooms it's easy to test for. But, like you said, not banned. So, no test.
@dimspace @festinagirl @lukascph @BobbitJ @SSbike @Velorooms On tramadol, yeah, it's pretty much an MPCC pinky promise.
@dimspace @BobbitJ @SSbike @Velorooms @lukascph oh. Well... Umm.. Yeah... Back to reading 101. Sorry.

@BobbitJ @ulif @TheRaceRadio Now,in someone w health issue,esp associated w gut,then things change.Intestine inflammation=reduced absorption

@alex_howes You best put some pants on.
@BobbitJ @ulif @TheRaceRadio No idea. I'd guess they did what's best for you. But the discussion point was pre-triathlon hydration IVs.
@ulif @TheRaceRadio Well, what do I know? Wasn't aware of that.
@ulif @TheRaceRadio maybe you should spend some time with a professional team to see how it all works?Like Kimmage did w us. Take as invite.
@SwiftMomentum @ulif @TheRaceRadio They are not. But apparently in tri it's a-ok.
@festinaboy @ulif @TheRaceRadio well, yeah, duh.
@ulif @TheRaceRadio human intestines have the absorb surface area of a football field. IV hydration is stupid, unless you have gut illness.

Don't judge me. https://t.co/IGtoYT1ffL
@SograSutherland excellent advice.
@cobbledClassic @RA_Dall @Winevalley1 @inrng @BrianCooksonUCI Yes, the voice of reason has spoken.
On a scale of 1-10, where does spending your morning pulling ticks out of your dog rate on the red neck scale?
@SSbike @debroy62 ASOUCI... It's the one world state spoken about in Revelations.
@RA_Dall @Winevalley1 @inrng @BrianCooksonUCI for ASO it'll be great. For athletes and teams? Not so great.
@JoshOwenMorris @dimspace @SSbike @lukascph Big Swan....
@dimspace @SSbike @JoshOwenMorris @lukascph that just shows you haven't done much research into cortisol testing. Risk is false pos, not neg
@dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms @JoshOwenMorris @lukascph considering MPCC teams make up 35% of peloton, that alone kills your supposition.
@dimspace @SSbike @Velorooms @JoshOwenMorris @lukascph NOT accurate.  At all.
@Elcoach @SSbike @inrng I would vote for the the return of Pat MacQuaid a long time before this dude. He's turned the PCC into a mess.
@Elcoach @SSbike @inrng No.
@Winevalley1 @inrng If he wins, it essentially means ASO runs the UCI. Athletes and teams become tertiary pawns.
@inrng Way to ruin my day.
@blair_houghton @wasclywabbit Yeah, I was pretty close to that.
@DenverCorkDork I think that's known as "premature birthday"....
What do I want to see in a VP debate? Two old white dudes, naked, debating who will run USA better if POTUS gets stuck under the fridge.
@wasclywabbit wind was varying from 210-250. Wildly varying. 28 was no better. 17 was wider.
@marclivolsi @mewmewmew13 guys were diverting to BJC from APA after 3/4 go arounds. Can't imagine it was any better. I just went for it.
@marclivolsi @mewmewmew13 I would not have flown yesterday, normally. Coming back from trip to Wisconsin w wife.
@mlatsch twin. So, I was using differential power AND rudder.
@mlatsch 20knots. I was landing 17, wind was 35/gust47 from 230... So... As long as it wasn't gusting, I was under. üòµ
Landed in 50mph crosswinds at KAPA yesterday with the wife on board. She would have screamed if not for the vomiting. #marriage #love

@ZeppeCat right?!
https://t.co/2BjdELFeZw
@Trudgin @Velorooms At this point in cycling, that's probably the better solution. MPCC demands it too.
@pdstone @dislocatedMTB @CyclingHubTV Nope. You can just take it. No TUE required.
@Velorooms ok, got the precise answer: 3 TUEs in 5 years. This year? Zero.
@raffilpt @CyclingHubTV well yeah. Duh. The question was 2010-2016.
@dislocatedMTB @CyclingHubTV Look down my timeline. Think I suggested that about a week ago!
@dislocatedMTB @CyclingHubTV There aren't really many other types of TUEs. antibiotics, Valtrex, whatever.. Don't need TUE.
@CyclingHubTV @dislocatedMTB he's asking for a grand total. Which I don't know. Not 13, that's for sure. But I don't keep track of inhalers.
@cobbledClassic @Velorooms Officially? Zero. But, of course, Tom D remains an open case.
@ianrobo1 @fshires I have no idea what's going on there. Not my employee. But obviously not cut and dried as many would like.
@fshires No.
@Velorooms to be clear, I am sure we have a few inhaler TUEs. I just don't keep track, as I have zero concern w inhalers.
@Velorooms if you want to pass pre race MPCC testing, pretty difficult to take any corticos beyond low dose inhaled.
@Velorooms 1 intra-articular TUE back in 2010/2011 for a guy with some wrist issues. Not 100% sure it was TUE tho, as was out of competition
@Velorooms As for inhalers, not really sure, as TUEs no longer required for many inhaled meds.
@Velorooms IM injectable TUEs? Zero. Oral prednisone? 1, Jack Bobridge for arthritis.
Weed: It's what my Uber smells like. #colorado
Thing is about saying "no rules were broken" concerning TUE, is that statement only true if stated reason u garnered TUE is 100% truthful.
@pslindgren rules were different when I raced. That's the short answer.
@JoeAjello no. 1999 (Ventoux) and 2001(bee sting)
@JoeAjello actually, no. At that point in time I was not. Neither was anyone on the team.
Just getting home from Vegas. Going to need to discuss various TUEs with team doctors. #itsjustarashiswear
@NPowless Wait.... I thought it was male stripper of the year? And "Powless" was just a stage name? #vegas #confused
@themollycameron best of luck with the team. And yes: #slaythedragon
@faustonef @ulif someone always has to be the rebel, eh?
@andyoakes @SSbike @Joelsimi @velocast Sure. Inhaler TUEs a whole different world to IM injections. That's why I don't have a lot of ?s.
@alex_howes she looks stuck. You should help her.
7am too early for EDM playing full blast in the elevator? Not in Vegas, it's not.
@SSbike @GingerCyclist not an easy task.
@ConorTMcGrane No.
@jreesnc No! I wanted to treat it unethically! They were the ones that said "no, we have to do this by the book"... And I'm grateful.
@jreesnc by being a member of mpcc and subjecting our riders to additional testing for cortisol, implicitly, have and do. Since 2007.
And that's why having good people around young hyper determined athletes is important. Big picture isn't so easy to see w/o years of life..
And I wanted to lie. But R Legeay's lesson was: It's still breaking rules if u take the substance for something other than what the TUE says
??? re my wasp sting in 2001: In 2001, TUEs were not permitted for insect bites. We could have lied and taken cortico for knee injury/asthma
@daimowrench oh... Very hard sell. However, considering employment in pro cycling in dependent, indirectly, on public trust...
@daimowrench Daimo! Of course, but being a highly paid athlete isn't a necessity. It's a privilege. Voluntary.
...which - btw - some TUEs are very legitimate and the athletes really do need certain treatments, just like anyone else in life.
Want a good solution for TUEs? Make it compulsory to publicly disclose all TUEs. Any athlete would think twice unless they really needed it.
@OnlyOneMUFC @evilscootus @TeflonDub @Digger_forum @bambula @cobbledClassic Think you need to read that a little more carefully.
@WillettKirk @bambula @TeflonDub @cobbledClassic @Digger_forum MPCC goes w sub 100. But that's fairly arbitrary.
@WillettKirk @bambula @TeflonDub @cobbledClassic @Digger_forum sorry! Didn't see you wrote IV. Yeah, that would definitely suppress.
@Digger_forum Depends. Remember w corticos you only need a TUE in competition. So, you only need to be covered for exact dates of comp.
@WillettKirk @bambula @TeflonDub @cobbledClassic @Digger_forum Not enough to trigger MPCC tests. Unless you just drank the stuff!!
@bicycle_addict @Digger_forum No.
@OnlyOneMUFC @evilscootus @TeflonDub @Digger_forum @bambula @cobbledClassic No. That's not a regulatory possibility either.
@Digger_forum @bambula @TeflonDub @cobbledClassic I agree with her. 100%
@evilscootus @TeflonDub @Digger_forum @bambula @cobbledClassic what do you do? I have no idea.
@evilscootus @TeflonDub @Digger_forum @bambula @cobbledClassic v good question. Imagine if athlete had faulty kidneys,not asthma; needs EPO
@Joelsimi @bambula Inhaled asthma meds have limited general absorption. Limiting perf benefits. Not so when consumed via injection or oral.
@bambula @Joelsimi it's fine. Fair question. I've got zero issue w use of inhaled asthma meds. It's when TUEs are abused that pisses me off.
@bambula @TeflonDub @cobbledClassic @Digger_forum Which I've got zero problem w inhaled asthma meds. Doesn't cause weight loss. Ok by MPCC.
@bambula @TeflonDub @cobbledClassic @Digger_forum not specific to that year, but continuation of 2008 inhaled salbutamol TUE. Yes.
@TeflonDub @cobbledClassic @Digger_forum zero general application cortico TUEs in Wiggins record from 2009.
@mewmewmew13 NO.
https://t.co/jg0wtWXR0G
@spragg247 regression guessing. We never really named it.
@jverheul @TheRaceRadio Winner!!!!
MPCC regs+testing a good solution. Cortico use allowed for asthma. But if doses high enough cortisol becomes suppressed=no start.
Problem occurs w high doses and general applications are used OOC without any TUE justification. Then perf enhanc(weight loss)is possible.
If an athlete is using appropriate dose of cortico for asthma/allergy/injury, perf enhanc benefits(weight loss etc) are very low or nil.
My issue w current cortico anti-Doping legislation is no TUE needed for OOC use. Totally free to use. No checks on abuse of legitimate use.
Opinion re corticos:OOC+In-comp fine w TUE.Useful+needed asthma/allergy/injury. However,shd cortisol be suppressed due to TUE abuse=No race.
@wsquared3d @nealrogers @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @SSbike yes. And why I've been saying for yrs, teams need to spend &gt;1% on anti-Doping.
@nealrogers @wsquared3d @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @SSbike and I believe that leaving it totally open is a mistake.
@nealrogers @wsquared3d @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @SSbike  my point, Neal, is u don't need an OOC TUE to take Corticosteroids. It's open.
@nealrogers @wsquared3d @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN assuming cortico is correct anti-venom for a snakebite. Sure.
@wsquared3d @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN perhaps an OOC TUE is warranted. But now you need nothing.
@jenscer @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN Anaerobic power, yes, you lose w fewer kgs. Not steady power.
@jenscer @LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN No. That's a myth. You don't lose aerobic power with -kgs.
@LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN but if corticos were just banned, then this wouldn't even be a topic!
@LarsBartoli @Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN careful. Strict diets work too. Just takes longer+harder. Not black/white.
@EagleEyeEd @Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN say NO when they ask "supersize?"
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN Only thing that stops this scenario is MPCC type cortisol testing. Or just banning corticos
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN go to camp, consume corticos, lose 4kgs, come back, stop taking corticos, race 4kgs lighter
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN MPCC has it right on this topic.
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN I'll take me being forced out of TdF over ambiguity.
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN game=consume cortico out of comp. lose weight.No TUE needed.Why MPCC cortisol test effectiv
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN But careful... Out of comp cortico requires zero TUE.
@Scienceofsport @nealrogers @SSbike @TJQuinnESPN I agree w Ross. Simplifies everything.
@CyclingHubTV you need some C-D gear.

@BisoBus @Ride_Argyle Thank you. I really appreciate that.
@Ride_Argyle looks like a nice dinner. Am I paying for that?
@fshires @Ride_Argyle I agree. But that's the system ASO wants. UCI tried their best to reform it, but were forced to cede to ASO's ideas.
@fshires @Ride_Argyle the stupidity in the system isn't the way points work. It's that ASO demanded promotion/relegation vs stability.
@fshires @Ride_Argyle The points have been the same for 7 years. We all knew the rules when we started this year - or recruited last year.
Nice work to all of @Ride_Argyle in making a massive leap forward in the rankings! Onward to Eneco and Lombardia! https://t.co/ndFYpBQbQM

@feria_sport @Digger_forum @MR_Ciclismo @MRasmussen1974 No. No TUE permitted for insect sting allergy in 2001. Rule changed as a result.
@feria_sport @Digger_forum @MR_Ciclismo @MRasmussen1974 But... The testing can't differentiate if you took it for a sting or a sore knee.
@feria_sport @Digger_forum @MR_Ciclismo @MRasmussen1974 also - in 2001, no cortico TUE was permitted for allergic reaction to insect sting.

Really sad to see @SimoClarke leave #LV2016... Simon is a superb road captain, mentor, and human being. He will be missed. Heal up fast.
@Jeffergnugen @TheRaceRadio When UCI tried to move to a more team friendly stance? Threats to remove TdF from World Tour. #dropthembritches
@Jeffergnugen @TheRaceRadio Rider safety? Costs ASO money. Franchises? Takes power away from ASO. Revenue sharing? Hurts ASO profit.
@Jeffergnugen @TheRaceRadio UCI is far from issue. Their lack of ability to change legislation to more rider/team friendly is forced by ASO.

@dbrabyn looks like the first thing to worry about is if the break makes it at all.
@dbrabyn not saying this would b true with any 3 riders. Dealt w plenty that would be a toddler mess in this situation. But these 3 are good
@dbrabyn not at the race, so I don't know who's feeling the most chipper today. These three are all very unselfish, so no issue.

@blair_houghton that was kind of my point. But I don't have to respect the method. And thank you.

@PDXWheels only if you choose to make it an empty gesture. I choose not to.
@cbacon74 @Kaepernick7 yeah. There are much better ways to get your message across. Thank you for your service.
@keylor_halbur well, anyhow, nice to converse with someone on social media without yelling and telling.
@WVTrakPak Bill of Rights is far more important to me than any individuals action. That's my point.
@keylor_halbur Yeah, I get your point. Just maybe call a press conference post game and articulate thoughts, as opposed to sitting.
@WVTrakPak slow down and read what I wrote more carefully. "Respect the right.."..Knee jerk reactions don't get us anywhere.

@dakylah so true. Everyone so focused on watts, etc etc.... Sometimes balls&gt;watts.
@ejlawman correct. But Andrew turned down opportunity for selection.
Cancellara brings it back. Interesting. Carrying his momentum better through corners having big effect in final portion of course.
Rohan, absolutely drilling it. Impressive. He tends to fade a bit in final 10-15 minutes, but may have a big enough advantage; won't matter.

@KJagers yes. He would. I'm just saying wet helps him.
True, but he's another one that I'm not sure if it wet suits him or not. Could still win, either way, of course. https://t.co/niUQsw8syt
Yep. Absolutely right.  https://t.co/H2zFy70LXj
Wet conditions in TT will favor Cancellara/Phinney...maybe Dumoulin...and not favor Froome/Martin. Rohan "darkhorse" Dennis cd go either way
@MikeFerrari4 so, you're going to gain 10kg by eating fried snacks at 4am after chasing women all night?
@bjbbiker @dougjunkins In Heber City, no go around. Nail it.
"How much you weigh, Joe?" "Ummmm... JV, I'm fine for the Vuelta, not fat! I'm good" ... "That's not why I'm asking" https://t.co/GW0zBjqubN
@bouldersmith now that is an intelligent comment. Thank you.
Oy veh, cycling fans on social media... win the Giro or Dauphine, they accuse you of doping. Have some crap season, they say you suck.
@Urban_monks @timross21 I don't like mean people. Pretty simple. Don't like grumpy ones either.
@jwbike I hope.
@JoeDombro just wait for tomorrow buddy. Heber to Leadville. Crazy takeoff. Crazy landing. Bring extra underpants.
@iamtourmalet @JoeDombro I've always wanted to go! Really need to.
Flew into the Heber Utah airport to pick up @JoeDombro for the Leadville100 next week.  Quite the landing approach. #extrahaironnuts
@dph525 @GranFondoGuide no idea. I'm not at the race.
@timross21 no idea. As a person, she's horrible. Not nice at all. But I have no idea on this story.
@SimoClarke yeah, but you went well. Congrats. Looking fwd to seeing you back marshaling the troops in green argyle.
Big congrats to @andrewtalansky and all of @Ride_Argyle!!!
@richardmoore73 @CaleyFretz emphasis on the 'nut' part.
They always told us Doping can't make race horse out of donkey. Boy were they wrong. https://t.co/8FlScD50X1
@polaspilates @Ride_Argyle either @UranRigoberto or @rusty_woods are your best bets.
@polaspilates quite a few. We have 6 total. No Americans tho!
@Jeff_in_Denver @velonews wow. Just wow.
@love_argyle @sepvanmarcke buy extra panties then.
@jaimiefuller Jack is the man. Didn't realize he was "ex" at WADA. Their loss.
@ednl @PearsonMarlys @jenscer Still is having a meltdown. üò°üò§üò•üò¢üò≠
@ednl @PearsonMarlys @jenscer actually you can. Because I was dude that told Hushovd to not pull w Cance. Thor had a meltdown. But JVS won!
@confaloniero @DylanvanBaarle Well, considering I coach Dylan, it'd be really odd for me to be coaching him on another team!!!üòò
@TheRaceRadio @Reid_Rothschild @DavidEpstein Jack is a great guy. Truly a good dude.
@viajoshhunt and it was part of Spain a few hundred years ago!
I love Paris-Roubaix. It's my favorite race, by far. So, I figured we needed to sign a guy that can win Paris-Roubaix. And we did...
@thejeffbiscuit love you too.
@freddreier sounds like a team too!
@UberReed @Tomashuuns I think it's not quite so lethal. It's part of the new "less restrictive" WT. I think. No one actually knows!
@Tommie2cans And he is 1. Batshit crazy and 2. Gives himself a bit too much credit with how guys ride...
@Tommie2cans @ulif me too!
@Tommie2cans @ulif That said, I don't believe in pressuring. And I don't feel their respective rebounds had anything to do w pressure.
@Tommie2cans @ulif No.They are huge talents.Have been since young.But both have been beyond my budget for years.Results in context of budget
@ulif But either way, I try and keep the blame and pressure on me, and away from the riders. Lessons learned the hard way.
@ulif So, I sit here and listen to everyone say we stink. And that I'm to blame. When we get back to a winning, other complaints surface!
@ulif Results come and go. Forcing them to happen to keep sponsors/fans/twitter happy is a recipe for Doping. I know. First hand.
@dbrogan yeah. That'll be tricky to detect...Probably only works in very short bursts (15mins) so might not be practical to use.
@renovandael saying "we're the youngest team in WT" is a fun PR stunt.The reality of producing results w such a young team requires patience
@LeFabe @hapagal @JoeDombro I wish were a little bit taller, I wish I were a baller...
Excuse me: Vuelta a Colorado
You know, we need more Spanish heritage in US races. Why always "Tour of Utah" "Tour of Cali"..I think Vuelta de Colorado sounds much better
@GoldeneSpeichen @hapagal @JoeDombro just looked up 'sjw'.... Learn something new every day!
@GoldeneSpeichen @hapagal @JoeDombro Well, I was just trying to help market 'red hot' Joe. I don't even know who the journo is!
@GoldeneSpeichen @hapagal @JoeDombro Did I say anything about the reporter? Good grief. Joe is hot. Try having a broader perspective, please
‚Äú@hapagal: #tou16 stage 1 Zion Canyon start @JoeDombro being interviewed https://t.co/T3MkiZlsuf‚Äù ... Just FYI, Joe is a single man....
@RickChasey what do I know? I can't even see the race.
@Ride_Argyle @PaddyBevin @RideLondon Go Paddy!! (Although how would broadcasters know?)
@nealrogers looks just like me!
@DadBurnett7 just saw your Twitter on the Weather Channel!!! #bigtime!!!
OH YEEEAAAHHHH!!!!!
@alex_howes @JoeDombro Of course he's panicking. He knows Alex Howes is hunting him.
@CyclingHubTV you guys finally get taken out by ASO special forces?
@alex_howes perhaps invading Germany, just for their airports is an option too? #Napoleon!!!!
@stol1975 if increased security was in the mix, I'd be a puppy. This is just stuff like "we cannot find the airplane"
@TweeterSagan #prayforluggage
Wow. Charles De Gaulle himself would roll over in his grave and cry at the disorganized mob/mess this airport is. #lemess
@not_the_drummer he is a bit obsessed with me.
@alex_howes that was a bit of a yard sale, eh?
@geneman10 yes. Absolutely. We are super interested in this area. I follow. DM me email.
@TommySingo totally agree.
@Cheapoflurane @ammattipyoraily @veloropa but most of the difference is athlete payroll.
@Cheapoflurane @ammattipyoraily @veloropa non wage costs are pretty constant. Of course, Sky can afford more altitude camps, coaches, etc.
@ammattipyoraily @veloropa anything for the secret man from Finland (i.e. Santa Claus)
@ammattipyoraily @veloropa actually, more like 35%.
@ammattipyoraily @veloropa Yes. About 25% more.
@veloropa @wsquared3d But let's be clear, I'd rather improve marketing metrics and have everyone at ‚Ç¨35M. Way better!
@matthewcbeaudin @EdwardPickering You still use the bathroom?
@veloropa @wsquared3d because no company without a chairman in love w cycling would spend ‚Ç¨35M. Marketing metrics fall apart at ~$20M
@EdwardPickering I laughed so hard it almost relieved the pressure of my recent cheese consumption.
@alex_howes @CwPearce @LeTour Grouchy girlfriends? That's a perk?
@festinaboy @veloropa @wsquared3d now I get told my conspiracy theory isn't quite conspiracy-ish enough.
@veloropa @wsquared3d love your optimism. But u haven't had to deal w this organization. Its a confluence of gov interest+Murdoch arm twist.
@veloropa @wsquared3d hahahahah... 'Smart'.... Oh dear....
@lostincosmos @fmk_RoI The irony there is, amongst cycling establishment,I'm the dissenting voice.So, dissenting on dissension? #illuminati
@owenp @cycling_podcast Nice work!
@davidnwelton learn something new every day!!!
Must have taken such imagination and provocative thought to erect a structure such as this. https://t.co/7xB5VDxf14
@willmiller79 @hepular @fmk_RoI Most people on my block think I train clowns to ride bikes in a circus. Wait.... I guess I do...
@PunkassCG @meowclank I'm a boorish, overprivileged white male w no self control. If I don't say this type of thing,who will? #lostculture
@nielstiekstra it's a bit tough on Twitter, but long term economic modeling prices financial parity in teams increases overall revenues.
@nielstiekstra but a luxury tax could. Which is probably only legal way of going about this in EU anyway. Assuming EU continues to exist!!?
https://t.co/a6zpCMVtQ5
The moment of entering Champs is unparalleled in life. A moment of great pride for the people of France that have endured so much recently.

@BrianCooksonUCI The suit is a nice tone of ros√© but more appropriate for the Giro, really, don't you think @ParisVaughters?
@alex_howes @NBCSNCycling @Ride_Argyle The 'baller' shirt?
@colnago2001 @LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio Yeah. That's another problem. Sad that folks won't just play fair.
@BenJones1973 @JamieGMac @TheRaceRadio yes. We won the Giro once too. Once.
@JamieGMac @BenJones1973 @TheRaceRadio On 3 yr deal for far more than I could afford. But would love to.
@GaryT14 @LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio Vuelta is owned by ASO.
@BenJones1973 @TheRaceRadio @JamieGMac In fact, I would say such an obvious and large advantage is contrary to the whole point of sport.
@BenJones1973 @TheRaceRadio @JamieGMac sorry, but you'll never convince me a race is as good as it can be w one team ‚Ç¨35M vs another w ‚Ç¨3.5M
@BenJones1973 @TheRaceRadio @JamieGMac So, when playing chess, it's ok that one player gets 4/5 queens and the other not. That's fair game?
@LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio 'weighs in' doesn't begin to say it. UCI has very little leverage with ASO. ASO dictate what happens. Period.
@Ride_Argyle could we do a kinda "sexy" version of this next?
@BenJones1973 @TheRaceRadio @JamieGMac Sorry, but I really can't see your point. Not even a little bit.
@LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio I used try and be part of cycling's governance for stuff like this. But it's pointless. ASO runs the show. Period
@LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio No doubt. F1 is boring these days due to just that.
@LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio game played by equals = greater competitiveness = better racing = more audience = more sponsors = happy!!!
@LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio I get 6 queens, you get 1. Go!
@TheVibesBJ @TheRaceRadio Yeah. I know. That's the pisser. Plus doesn't fit ASO monopolistic agenda well. 8 riders does.
@LarsBartoli @TheRaceRadio easy to understand. Every team has a budget limit. Like playing chess. With same number of pieces per player.
@TheRaceRadio no you dumb nuts, you need NFL style financial fairness and drafting. But whatever. Sure. 8 riders. Genius.
How was the new Star Trek?
@timross21 @nealrogers Rigo
@mobilehaha you're probably right. Was just being a bit crass, I suppose. Was just trying to express extreme respect for Pierre.
@nealrogers @jaynrobinson Chillin at the mtb race in Rio... What could go wrong?
@nealrogers @jaynrobinson Sagan isn't even racing. So, I'd say not. He's doing the MTB race!
@mobilehaha oh good grief. Poor leadership is taking yourself so seriously you have to edit everything to the point of boredom.
@Laura_Weislo @johnwbradley @joelindsey And that too. More going on in your head, the worse you go downhill.
@HarrahMatthew @gottabeactive It was a land, get out, and call Trade-A-Plane immediately, moment.
@joelindsey 'setback' might not be the word for it on this downhill!!!
@joelindsey Nibali hit the deck yesterday. Messes with your nerves. Normally, Pierre is a great descender. Not today....
@HarrahMatthew @gottabeactive Yeah, by shutting down the left engine!!!  Wife was in the plane with me. No power. Manual gear down crank.
@joelindsey gotta watch more bike racing. Dude is quick in the wet. They don't call it Pais Chuvasco for nothing!
@HarrahMatthew @gottabeactive I mean A day. Not B day.
@HarrahMatthew @gottabeactive we need to catch up. Have a great 'left alternator is on fire' story for you. Happy B day!
@PunkassCG @meowclank I'm speaking for myself. And myself only. Just a little crush I have.
@HarrahMatthew @gottabeactive You gotta see how that photo shows up on Twitter timeline...
@meowclank @PunkassCG @PierroooRolland üòÅ
I cannot imagine the fear Pierre must feel on this descent after yesterday. Just praying for him to stay calm and stay safe. #frogman
And Pierre is in the breakaway.............üò≥
@nicwint @PierroooRolland me either!
Little extra riding for @PierroooRolland... Work the kinks out from hitting the deck like a sack of bricks at 60kph. https://t.co/neWSSLoSHP
‚Äú@PierroooRolland: Le tour de France, la plus belle...https://t.co/rhPZjBQZwh‚Äù .. Take the time to read this. All of my respect for this guy
@TiesjBenoot believe me, it won't be your last WT top 5 GC
@nicrestreposus @CaleyFretz @nealrogers well, thank you for noticing! I'm more used to people telling me I should kill myself on Twitter.
@nicrestreposus @CaleyFretz @nealrogers yeah, but it keeps getting broken.
@nicrestreposus @CaleyFretz @nealrogers not me.
@nicrestreposus @CaleyFretz @nealrogers he's already been signed.
üò©üò∞üò•üò¢üò™
@MrKatieCompton @nealrogers No, he hit a small diesel spill. End of story.
@MrKatieCompton @nealrogers except that crash was before the apex. But yeah, I'm sure you know better.
Shit
Frogman don't go down without a fight, I can tell you that about this kid. He's had a nasty crash, stitches, and a nasty infection. #hardman
Really need me one of those mountain horns.
Pierre is finally healthy, so he's going well. Unfortunately, seems that today Astana wants to flex their muscles.
@paulscoins yuk
@lawineproject btw - really great business concept you have going there.
@lawineproject Thought a lot about this. Just always feel slimy asking people to basically pay the salaries of pro athletes.
@AmBoDe33 @EuroHoody Beane's ideas only lasted 2 years. The rest caught up.
@oufeh What happened to that guy? Just vanished after that TT.
@AndyElche You just gave me an erection.
@mhr1711 Thank you. Very nice of you to say.
@dmyrcr If you have a sponsor/investor, we're happy to grow!
@AndyElche and then once you did well, you'd get levered away by Sky... Believe me, been through this w Wiggo. Sucked.
@M311Simon This is what needs 2b addressed. Over dominance will reduce audience numbers in many markets. In turn causing further bifurcation
@AndyElche I hope! We do try our best.
Btw -No kvetching intended on my part. Just being factual. Sometimes us little guys put together upsets. Which is really fun when it happens
@AndyElche Not dwelling. Just being factual.
@AndyElche mmmmm... No, I don't think so. Sorry. But even if you were correct, yes, sometimes things fall your way. See Giro '12.
@M311Simon which you can reduce by having the 8 strongest guy to drive one guy at the front and avoid all crashes.
@mhr1711 Yep!
@ParaicM I've been on about this for ages. Doubtful it happens. But was commenting on some stories that popped up today.
@DaroPL_AFC Just sayin it like it is! Not how it should be!
@bknealon Successful early? See 2010 TdF. Plus, already started w one of largest budgets in the world.
@mhr1711 No. Competence follows best pay.
@M311Simon Correct, but football has greater "team" and "skill" component.Cycling is all about horsepower. But miracles happen. See Giro '12
@DaroPL_AFC They get paid a lot over market to rescind personal ambition. Very successful strategy from management standpoint. Obviously!
@mhr1711 W all due respect, that's completely ignoring how transfers and talent recruiting occur in professional sports.
Why does rider comp matter in overall team performance? In transfer market, best talent goes to highest bidder. Not pay more=go faster. Duh
@ManuDenaveau Every rider is underpaid relative other professional sports. Every single one.
Seeing discussions re financial parity. Perspective: my highest paid rider at TdF would be 7th highest paid rider in Sky's TdF lineup.
@mattrabin ooof... That looks rough. Let me know how she goes down.
@AarFleishman @JoeDombro my brain.
@AarFleishman @JoeDombro I dislike Training Peaks for analyzing data from high level riders. However, its a good tool for up-and-comers.
@JoeDombro @robbo2911 @Ride_Argyle What we do once we've wrestled the pig to the ground is classified.
@robbo2911 @Ride_Argyle @JoeDombro We do a lot of stuff. But in this truncated email, it's referring to sets/reps of leg press.
@Rockybucket they need to reconsider the weather too.
@CaleyFretz Happily, they will all be retired and more concerned about their supply of Fixodent soon.
Man, the Mafioso Bambino was all over it in @tourdepologne. Congrats @Davide_villella @davideformolo+especially to "Rambo"@AlbertoBettiol!!
@EuroHoody Great, then maybe Mr. Badger should ask his employers to spend a bit more on rider security. Then this won't happen.
Very prelim update re @Mattibreschel: He's ok, but had a cut deep enough into his leg, it needed to be attended to ASAP.
@ParisVaughters right.
@Chasseur_Patate I'm amazed he's still in the race. Tough ass bastard. We'll see how he heals in the next few.
@EuroHoody Damn, Hoodie, you're doing it right!!!
@joepabike @freddreier So, yes we can reduce the number of media oriented motos easily. But media will need a new plan, if we want coverage.
@joepabike @freddreier Tricky. Most are Gendarmes. A few a judges. The ones getting in the way, usually, are TV/photographer motos.
@Doefnix @theengbayton @RiksRedGuard Has14 stitches in his body.Any other rider would be DNF.But please,by all means,continue being assholes
@Tideplay1 @PierroooRolland history tends to repeat itself. Sadly.
@Tideplay1 despicable. But France has bigger issues today. And I can tell you, I've never found a more honorable dude than @PierroooRolland
@2davidl damn right. Hopefully someday collective balls will outweigh collective fear.
@carlabond no doubt. The security around the TdF is going to be full lockdown. Understandable, but sad that it's come to this.
@KingPaul76 yeah, I just read it. So awful.
@KingPaul76 yes. I see that now. So sad.
Good grief. Just reading news out of Nice. Horrible.
@holowesko but...Drafting motos that are too close to begin with has changed far too many race results. Big problem. But not today's problem
@holowesko very little draft at 20kph. Plus, in that situation, no choice but to follow same line as Moto. No space elsewhere.
Well, now that that is over, I can get back to scrutinizing photos of @Caitlyn_Jenner to determine if she's gained any lbs since last week.
@GertjanMoerkerk @el_snoop That was equally ridiculous.
@lsh18 It's a duct tape the root error with a 'fair-ish' unprecedented decision. While I think it's correct, be better to fix root problem.
@luke_beatty a bit ridiculous. To say the least.
UCI judges made the right call on that one...Hopefully it's a fair race going forward.
@LucGrefte You would think....
Anyone up for calculating the cost of crowd barriers vs the profit generated by the TdF? Of which the riders receive zero...
Unreal. The number of infuriating issues, driven by greed, that caused that mess... Just sad.
@katannedunnigan come on!! It's almost the same! Almost....
@SonOfTheDude @nealrogers @MikeFerrari4 üëç
Just think of tomorrow's Ventoux stage as the circumcised version of the full thing. #letour #TDF2016 #20%off!
@nealrogers @MikeFerrari4 Btw - I am not above any of this sort of behavior. At all. Although I really should try to be.
@nealrogers @MikeFerrari4 where was Quintana's complaint when it was snowing on the Stelvio? This is why UCI/ASO don't take riders seriously
@MikeFerrari4 pro cycling 101: complain when things worked against you. Accuse others of being whiney when they worked in your favor.
@thejensie That like a Donald Trump thumb? A Thump?
@luke_beatty anyhow, if you have the time, I'm happy to get you up to speed.
@luke_beatty Be happy to help out, but it takes a few hours of solid Q&amp;A to get the basics. Then move on to the complex/juicy stuff.
@luke_beatty Wish more folks asked this sort of question.Cycling is highly nuanced and infinitely strategic on many levels; not just in race
@luke_beatty be happy to answer any questions you have re infrastructure+bus model of cycling team. Or whatever ??s you might have.
@PaulKimmage @millarmind @ChristianVDV @nicholasroche @MRasmussen1974 More endurance load+less intensity load=less explosive/better recovery
@KathrynBertine and green carpet. And a green chair...
Tough guy ride by @PierroooRolland... To only lose 2 minutes after taking a hit like he did yesterday. Serious gut check. True #frogman
@perryd123 start calling me nasty names.
‚Äú@RorkeDenver: Shout out+respect to @PierroooRolland. Only warriors take falls like that and press on: #frogman" Shout out is huge honor!
https://t.co/sYJhLxbLsE
Pierre getting stitched up after punching a retaining wall. Morale is still good, amazingly. Tough dude. #frogman https://t.co/XIX3tIpM68
Probably was also the cause of him losing contact last part of last climb. He just thought it was melty asphalt on hot roads. Shit day.
Unfortunate day. Pierre was riding well, but a very slow puncture he didn't immediately notice last 2kms climb caused him to slide out. üòî
@jameslatoff with ASO wanting to introduce promotion/relegation, selfless work won't count as much as UCI points.
@furnace_media oh yeah
@JonnyAbbott82 $$$$&gt;TdF
@RoadRevGallery yes 30% more payroll will buy you that luxury.
Incredible management or piss poor management have very little to do with either. Human nature? Everything to do with it.
Why discord Tinkoff but precision Sky? Former ending in 5mos, guys nervous for job. Latter has all on huge, long term, guaranteed contracts.
@le_moccasin yeah, it's like a periscope.
Hmmmm.... I think shareholder distributions at ASO must have increased due to infrastructure maintenance cutbacks. #MBAbullshitwords
Ok, Colorado, time to start making some noise for born, bred, and raised native @alex_howes !!!
Interesting day developing.

@jeffkmd @philgaimon @Tomashuuns @olegtinkov ...of course. Oleg is correct. But ASO doesn't want change. And so here we are.
@TheRaceRadio @Knepherbird that makes more sense.
@TheRaceRadio come on. Really?
@wouterwippert @Ride_Argyle @DrapacCapital Congrats big man!

@EuroHoody business interests and entrenchment of monopoly won out over athlete's rights and team stability. Really sad.

@festinaboy  Thanks for dropping by training camp. Fun chat. We'll be in touch.
Dammit.
@DaRC_Fantom üòâ
@zoeart @JoeDombro would love to, but he'd  be totally cooked after Giro/Swiss.
@Ride_Argyle snow.
@theboz91 @GeraintThomas86 I see. Well, enjoy the sausage.
@GeraintThomas86 There's a giant, naked dude just having his dinner?
Took the boys on a wee little jaunt around the Pyrenees today. 12,000 vertical feet later they seem somewhat upset. #waseasyinthecar
@theboz91 It's like Switzerland's version of Staten Island.
@CaleyFretz you're gonna go surfing in Burlington Vermont?
Watching the recap of today's @tds stage. Man, @JoeDombro single handedly out Skyed Sky on that last climb. #Joe&gt;Sky
Superb riding by @andrewtalansky today! #dontcallitacomebackibeenhereforyears...
@alex_howes 'loan wolf'.... That like a land based  loan shark?
@Reid_Rothschild @mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe sorry. Burger.
@Reid_Rothschild @mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe That's super interesting. Did not know justice Berger said that.
Can't help it if we're tilted.

@EuroHoody do what's charitable: donate them to starving vampires.
Did @petosagan have a motor in his bike today? No. Did he make everyone else look like a fool today? Yes. Enough said on this topic.
@mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe took me years to not tell people to "blow me" on Twitter when they got a bit pointed in discussion.
@mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe And that, I agree with 100%.
@mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe Wish I knew the answer.
@mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe To me, 2 things: Life is sacred. The Constitution/Bill of Rights are brilliant. Makes this issue hard.
@mewmewmew13 @fredfalcone @ckibbe don't think that block worthy. Figuring out how Bill of Rights applies to 21st century requires dialogue.
@roentgenwarrior That's why I said I don't envy them.
I truly do not envy the position and power of the lawmakers and leaders of this country during times like these. I wish them vision+strength
Sad day.
Found another thing I love about France beyond @PierroooRolland, @JeremySeysses, and cheese:@QueensChristine, know I'm late, but great tunes
I don't know about you, but I'm thinking whoever Don King endorses for President, must be a well thought out and logical choice.
@philgaimon @SophieSmith86 Did someone say '3 way' ???
Not only that, but the toilet just accused me of Doping. Said there's no statistical way that much could come out of a human.
Celebrated my bday w nasty bout of food poisoning. Just finished analyzing @tomjelteslagter+@PierroooRolland power on the toilet. #multitask
This guy, @micacquarone, one of the rare, truly good, people that comes into professional cycling. I wish him the best.
@SenatorBrophy That's the color of 'naders
@JeremySeysses I'll read that as "yes"
@JeremySeysses So, what you're saying is that you're cool with swinging?
Doing some video analysis of @PierroooRolland gear selection for sprint today. Too big? No way! #strongman #1975!! https://t.co/aKTEz57iqK
.@tonymartin85 This has been happening forces too long! Needs to stop. However, that Moto is Gendermerie. Not under @UCI_cycling control.
@oufeh @davidsamaniego You're discounting micro accelerations within pedal stroke. 2kgs would be more like 30-40 seconds. Imo.
@oufeh although part of PR's issue was starting too fast. So, he didn't get a good placing from the 6.7. But still 7 to win.
@oufeh Pierre was at 6.7....So, 6.9-7 ftw.
@LarsBartoli you make it 10 years in this business half alive, and you've got some funny stories to tell.
@LarsBartoli had a sponsor back out re rumors losing Thor Hushovd. Tried to convince them guy named Chris Froome was gonna be good. No luck.
@LarsBartoli @tuttobiciweb_it actually, transfer gossip is incredibly hurtful and damaging to sponsorships and investors. Not funny at all.
@LarsBartoli @tuttobiciweb_it Printing any random rumor because u heard it from someone's friend's, brother's, nephew's son isn't reliable?
@daniellloyd1 purging.
@RohanDennis new beauty contest? Miss Calculated!!!
Dinner @FrascaFoodWine tonight w @rusty_woods +@ERSuperStar.They asked me for apropos attire. Cool @BobbyStuckeyMS ? https://t.co/otMOsiLESt
Very heartbroken by the passing of Blue Angels pilot Jeff Kuss. As a pilot, a patriot, and a member of a USN family, I pray for his family.
@Greggy_Daniel @velonews @philgaimon After they finish eating the pickles, yes.
@Caflockton @festinaboy I don't, actually. I bet @vinovaughters does though. She's the wine Jedi.
@pcxmo Really? I would agree, but I have no idea where any of the media rights funds go to. From an athlete/team perspective, they vanish.
@festinaboy @Caflockton @peterpouly @JoeDombro pas normal. üòò
Simplified video of how @VelonCC and @tds live on bike telemetry announcement is viewed by some... https://t.co/AyaLEzQiSp
@lawsoncraddock just sent you an email that'll give you more jitters than coffee!
@marctrussler @giroditalia @CyclingHubTV true story.
@PDXWheels well, the only proven natural method to decrease binding is weight lifting and little/zero endurance training. Do some squats.
@PDXWheels huh... Because sometimes high T/high binding is due to guys using rogaine to keep hair. That's the only thing I can think of.
@PDXWheels I know this may be a bit personal, but are you going bald and using rogaine or propecia?
@PDXWheels checked estradiol? DHT? Sounds like you're overproducing T, because so much of it is being bound up. Body is trying to compensate
@PDXWheels I don't know of any specific cases of this, but is plausible. Normally total T goes quite low w cyclists, but free T remains ok.
@PDXWheels so, basically a decrease in free testosterone due to elevated binding?
I kinda miss watching Giro every AM on @CyclingHubTV ... üòø
@tpbikeranch of course. Without question.
Hats off to all who served this great nation. However, this day is in remembrance of those who gave their lives so that we may live free.
Well deserved celebratory dinner post #Giro for @Ride_Argyle https://t.co/tbijtmYjGi
https://t.co/7ssPnnS2Pn
Hugs and kisses to all of @Ride_Argyle at Giro. Especially @AlbertoBettiol for doing a fantastic first GT at 21! All my babies growing up üò•
@UberReed @CaleyFretz @Greggy_Daniel yep
All that aside, big congrats to @Greggy_Daniel for pulling off a big one. We went to same high school, and I gave him my bike when he was 15
Don't get me wrong, I love @alex_howes like a son. Has raced for me since 2004. He did a great ride today. Just a bit of luck...someday...
Another close call for @alex_howes today. Ug. I'll be phoning my therapist first thing Monday.
@indurain81 No. Paul has been my friend for a lot longer than digger idiot has been on Twitter. So, both of you can stick it.
2/2: Being a pro cyclist comes w/ inherent risk. But It's our collective responsibility to reduce risk + w/ the moto issue, we must do more.
1/2: #BelgiumTour crash highlights yet again ongoing issue w/ rider safety - esp regards to motos. Resolution is obviously a high priority.
@VirginieLcuyer @Ride_Argyle @kskjerping Lots of lost skin, and in pain, but preliminary reports are encouraging.
Great ride by @JoeDombro today. He's come a long, long way from where he was in 2014. More to come, I'm sure.
Solid ride by @UranRigoberto today. That's why I hired the guy, even if he gets sick or has bad luck, he fights back. #leadership.
I really cannot believe this. So idiotic. https://t.co/72gug2L0TV
@laetti perhaps. Labor has its pleasures.
@MorenoMoser Been thinking about something to say to try and cheer you up. I got nothin. But man, you are one strong bastard. You'll bag one
Thanks so much to @ArtMags for a fun photo shoot of our rather eccentric collection of American and Western art. Look forward to the spread!
@AmigoDeBirillo @LottoJumbo_road yes, we won the giro as a small budget team once too. 2012. Doesn't make it easy to keep up.
@BenKing89 @JoeDombro @natebrown0707 was that "go Big Joe!" Or "go big, Joe!" ???
@Chasseur_Patate Lowest WT budget. Per UCI audit.
Video regards challenges of managing WT team on a small budget.  https://t.co/1wan0cglXA
@EuroHoody A strike in France? How strange...
@BenKing89 Ben, it's inappropriate putting photos of @JoeDombro privates on Twitter. Don't you think @natebrown0707? #mamba
Only 12 minutes to make up!!! #astanatremblesinfear https://t.co/FNrg4u1HO8
@mewmewmew13 @ricktillery #poordoggie
@joelindsey Knowing Travis, he's probably upset and venting over lack of clear action; obviously more difficult to get consensus in WADA/IOC
@joelindsey Pretty tough to pull the pin 2 months out. Exactly.
@Tomashuuns I don't think you're ugly...üòç

@Vengencemonkey This is Colorado, boy. There is no such thing as "without the gun"
Doodle bumper stickers? The Rapture grows near. https://t.co/Ah87GOQw7d
@vinovaughters Yeah, but all the old ladies at the gym don't. Is this what happens with age?
@KenSommer Maybe I should try that? #verticlehairysmile
I don't get it, I always smile at people. Always. And people rarely smile back. #amiugly? #doismellbad?
@SenatorBrophy You haven't lived until you've run into that stuff in a Cessna. Woooo doggie!!
1973. Good vintage for folks born in Colorado. https://t.co/C5ipF6YktT

@dogrina2 @petosagan @gofundme @briandokter Believe me, I would love to. He's a great guy beyond being an incredible bike racer.
@dogrina2 @petosagan @gofundme @briandokter Yes. I just have to fire all the other riders. And mechanics. And directors. And me...
@CyclingHubTV perfect! The kids at the Catholic elementary school are going to be super excited that I included this in my presentation.
