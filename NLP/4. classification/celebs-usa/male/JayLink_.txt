90% of men kiss their wife goodbye when they leave the house. The rest kiss their house goodbye when they leave the wife.
The husband who wants a happy marriage should learn to keep his mouth shut and his checkbook open.
The only one of your children who does not grow up and move away is your husband.
There's a fine line between cuddling and holding someone down so they can't get away.
I should've known it wasn't going to work out between my ex-wife and me. After all, I'm a Aries and she's a bitch.
Money can't buy happiness, but it sure makes misery easier to live with.
A bank is a place that will lend you money, if you can prove that you don't need it.
Politicians and diapers have one thing in common. They should both be changed regularly, and for the same reason.
Do not argue with an idiot. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.
Now Kids..it's been ages since I dropped some of my One Liners on you... so here are a few to make you chuckle  lol

I have had an awesome career. I never made it to the A game.. took too many years off to raise kids family etc..  My talent was always a gift a blessing.. it never affected who I was as a human being.
What do we do when music artists become delusional unmanageable.. so full of themselves they become caricatures and no longer real people. I guess fame does that to some people.. Sad
Oh my @kanyewest is at it again.. Claims he is the "Best Living Recording Artist". No offense my Brother but I could sing better than you with a live chicken stuffed down my throat...lol  any day any time :)
Yes it's true ...the early bird gets the worm... But the second mouse gets the cheese lol

They say when a man holds a woman's hand before marriage, it is love, after marriage, it is self-defense
I hope I'm the last guy on earth -- I wanna see if all those women were lying to me.
Hallmark Card: "I'm so miserable without you, it's almost like you're still here."
Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.
A bank is a place that will lend you money, if you can prove that you don't need it.
Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it, misdiagnosing it and then misapplying the wrong remedies.

What's the difference between Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan? If Trump gets Alzheimers his IQ will go up.
Have you seen the Clint Eastwood film about Donald Trump? It's called "Billion Dollar Cry Baby".
If I wanted to kill myself, I'd climb Trump's ego and jump down to his I.Q.
I went to my hairstylist and requested the "Donald". She asked "What's That?" I said "Shaggy hair with a gay combover"
Why doesn't Melania Trump want to be the first lady? Because she would have to move into a smaller house
Why does Donald Trump take Xanax? For Hispanic attacks.   Ohhhh thats bad.. Hey don't kill the messanger  lol
What does Melania see in Donald Trump? "Ten billion dollars and high cholesterol!"
Trump: "Foreign Policy?, if you mess with the United States, there will be hell toupee
OK Trump supporters you have this coming.... a special edition of my #TrumpOneLiners  !!

Why is it so hard for women to find men that are sensitive, caring, and good-looking? Because those men already have boyfriends.
I don't suffer from insanity. I enjoy every minute of it.
Hallmark Card: "I'm so miserable without you, it's almost like you're still here."
The voices in my head may not be real, but they have some good ideas!
Women will never be equal to men until they can walk down the street with a bald head and a beer gut, and still think they are sexy.
If God is watching us, the least we can do is be entertaining.
I had the right to remain silent, but I didn't have the ability.
Keep the dream alive: Hit the snooze button.
I hope I'm the last guy on earth -- I wanna see if all those women were lying to me.

If at first you don't succeed, you'll get a lot of free advice from folks who didn't succeed either.
There is always something to be thankful for. If you can't pay your bills, you can be thankful you are not one of your creditors.

Just about the time when you think you can make ends meet, somebody moves the ends.
The difference between divorce and legal separation is that a legal separation gives a husband time to hide his money.
The big difference between sex for money and sex for free is that sex for money usually costs a lot less.

I will have enough money for the rest of my life. Of course, if I don't buy and eat anything.
It used to be only death and taxes were inevitable. Now, of course, there's shipping and handling, too.  ( I Love this one  lol )
You take away the looks, money, intelligence, charm and success and, really, there's no real difference between me and George Clooney.
Money talks ...but all mine ever says is good-bye.
What's six inches long, two inches wide, and drives women wild? Money
What does Money do for you?? Like it? Hate it? Need More? Couldn't care less.. Talk to me People

And Finally......Never laugh at your girlfriends choices... your one of them.
I'm great at multitasking. I can waste time, be unproductive, and procrastinate all at once.
What's six inches long, two inches wide, and drives women wild? Money.
I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it.
My wife and I were happy for twenty glorious years. Then we met.
Never tell your problems to anyone...20% don't care and the other 80% are glad you have them...
Before having a kid the most important thing to ask yourself is "Am I ready to watch the exact same cartoon on repeat for the next 4 years?"
Relationships are a lot like algebra. Have you ever looked at your X and wondered Y?
Love it!!! Happy New Year Beth  Hugs  xo https://t.co/iuOGnU1mfW
My girlfriends dad asked me what I do. Apparently, "your daughter" wasn't the right answer.
I hate when I am about to hug someone really sexy and my face hits the mirror.
You know you're ugly when it comes to a group picture and they hand you the camera.
Politicians and diapers have one thing in common. They should both be changed regularly, and for the same reason. Just Sayin  :)
Did I hit your funny bone yet?? Not even a chuckle  ??? Now my top ten classic crappy one liners from years past... Ohhh that smell  :)
I'm not saying I hate you, but I would unplug your life support to charge my phone.
I think my neighbor is stalking me she's been googling my name on her computer. I saw it through my telescope last night.
If 2015 was a person, I’d sue him for pain and suffering and lost wages.
I was going to quit ALL my bad habits for this New Year, but then I remembered Nobody likes a quitter  !
My New Years Eve Forecast: Mostly Drunk with a slight chance of passing out  :)

Well Kids... Happy Sunday ... Spread a little Christmas Cheer and Love around to those who need it!!
I am an escapee of a political correction facility
An honest politician is one who, when he is bought, will stay bought.
A politician should do two terms - one in office and one in jail
It’s a sad day when our politicians are comical and I have to take our comedians seriously!
Politics is just show business for ugly people  :)
I don't approve of political jokes... I've seen too many of them get elected  !
And now for your pleasure and enjoyment some crappy political one liners coming up   :)
OK it's #CrazyPoliticsSeason   I actually came from a political family... so I hate politics more than the average guy..  lol Don't hurt me
#DonaldTrump Standing up for #Putin calling our President Weak and Ineffective. Isn't that treason ? ....
December 20th.... 5 days until Christmas..... Now What ???

Black Friday = The Day People Spend Money They Don't Have On Things They Don't Need.
EVERY day is "Black Friday" if you're a Kardashian.  Oh Jay... Behave   lol
Black Friday: A day Americans are willing to kill over materialistic things just a day after celebrating what they're already thankful for.

OK Kids..turkeys in the oven, Enjoy your day with family &amp; friends, good food, football and a little chill time. Miss you all! Happy T Day!
What would you get if you crossed a turkey with an evil spirit? A poultrygeist!
For the first time, we are going to have a HAPPY Thanksgiving. This year, I am stuffing the turkey with Prozac!   I'm Joking...Gezzz..  :)
There is a special place in hell for people that play Christmas music before Thanksgiving.
I'm excited about Thanksgiving because I love unwelcome parenting advice from relatives I see twice a year.
What's the best way to stuff a turkey? Serve him lots of pizza and ice cream!
OK Am I smelling up your kitchen yet with the sweet smell of these Thanksgiving one-lines...  lol  Let me know....
What did the mother turkey say to her disobedient children? "If your father could see you now, he'd turn over in his gravy!"
Why did they let the turkey join the band? Because he had the drumsticks
Dear Turkeys, don't worry... they only love us for our breasts too. Sincerely, women.
What happened when the turkey got into a fight? He got the stuffing knocked out of him!
Why can't you take a turkey to church? They use FOWL language.
What did the turkeys sing on Thanksgiving Day? God save the kin.
Who never eats on Thanksgiving ? A Turkey , because it's always stuffed... ohhhh
It's Been a while Kids.. So today in honor of Turkey Day. I'm gonna post some of my Crappy Thanksgiving one-liners. try to pay attention lol
Happy Thanksgiving everyone. I am so thankful and so blessed with my wonderful family and so many beautiful friends... #MuchLove to you all

A husband is living proof that a wife can take a joke.
People will believe anything if you whisper it.
People can be divided into three groups: Those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened.
The only one of your children who does not grow up and move away is your husband.
Just about the time when you think you can make ends meet, somebody moves the ends.

People will accept your ideas much more readily if you tell them Benjamin Franklin said it first.  Ya Know Like ummm Death and Taxes
@rosiebray65 hahah good one!
I think animal testing is a bad idea; they get all nervous, and give the wrong answers.
A backyard barbecue draws two things...flies and relatives.
A woman has got to love a bad man once or twice in her life, to be thankful for a good one.
are you guys having any fun yet? You know this is a LOT of work  lol U can post some crappy one-liners for me to read and share too!
I often find myself crying after sex.....  mace will do that to you....  :)
There's a fine line between cuddling and holding someone down so they can't get away.
You can lead a man to Congress, but you can't make him think.
When you are in it up to your ears, keep your mouth shut.
@CayoKath Yes I think so  these are all sent to me by friends or taken from the internet..
A truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a unicorn.
Every man has his price. Mine is $3.95.
Hate is like swallowing poison and waiting for the other person to die.
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt.
@rosiebray65 sorry  ur too late....
Men are like mascara, they usually run at the first sign of emotion.
Good girls are bad girls that never get caught.
Scientists have discovered a food that diminishes a woman's sex drive by 90%. It's called "a wedding cake".
I may not be totally perfect, but some parts are pretty good.
Constipated people don't give a crap.
I am trying to see things from your point of view, but I can't get my head that far up my ass.
I'm Filthy Stinking Rich... Well, Two Out of Three Ain't Bad
When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.

Health experts recommend a 1500 calorie diet. For those of you not good with math… that’s a 12-pack of 125 calorie beers.
My girlfriend thinks that I’m a stalker. Well, she’s not exactly my girlfriend yet.
Math questions r so stupid! They’re like “If I have 5 bottles in one hand &amp; 6 in the other,what do I have?”I dunno, a drinking problem maybe
hates it when I look horrible in a group photo and the person that looks good refuses to delete it.
Today, I’ll be cleaning. And by cleaning, I mean drinking booze and spraying everything with Febreze.
Note from my Daughter:  Just because we have the same last name doesn’t mean we have to be Facebook friends, Dad  :)
That awkward moment when you have 10+ tabs open and you can’t figure out which one the music is coming from.
Energizer Bunny arrested and charged with battery
I think that if I died and went straight to hell it would take me at least a week to realize I wasn't in Fresno anymore.
I sometimes watch birds and wonder “If I could fly who would I shit on?”
Most of us can keep a secret. It's the people we tell it to who can't.
Beer: Helping ugly people have sex since 3000 B.C.!!!
Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.
Sarcasm helps keep you from telling people what you really think of them.
I dream of a better tomorrow... where chickens can cross the road and not be questioned about their motives.
To find out a girl's faults, praise her to her girlfriends.
@Taliassima I hope so...It's a long story Talia.. I can share it with you outside of social media sometime if you'd like! TY
If God had meant me to touch my toes he would have put chocolate on the floor.
You know you're ugly when a nymphomaniac tells you, "Let's just be friends."
If I can be of any help . . . you're in worse shape than I thought.
A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.
@vipregan Oy This IS new Material  from 1957  haha Geez...
When you get to the point where you really understand your computer, it's probably obsolete.
I sometimes go to my own little world, but that's okay, they know me there.
@vipregan too late  :)
@Taliassima  I agree with you... and anyone who spews hatred &amp; harasses others should be removed from twitter...
OK Twitches... time for some crappy one-liners... Oh stop groaning.. You know u like em'   lol
@honeybill1  Hugs  xxoo  TY Brenda Why some people use twitter to bully &amp; spread hate I will never know!
