14-0 feels like 41-0.

Dabo coached a game for the ages and then chased it with the best postgame interview ever.
To quote the late Pat Tillman, this is a NICE SWIFT ASS-KICKING.
Trevor Lawrence is 19. And still looks like a grown ass man playing against children
Justyn Ross. Unreal.
Is this Nick Saban Bama or Mike Shula Bama?
#Beatdown
It‚Äôs not a fake if everyone knows it‚Äôs coming
Remember when everyone said this is the best Bama team ever?
A true freshman is turning Nick Saban‚Äôs defense inside out in the national championship.
Tua‚Äôs first INT was the worst pass he‚Äôs thrown.  And that one was even worse.
Shout out to the NFL teams Tanking For Tua in 2019 and Losing For Lawrence in 2020
How the hell can Saban recruit everything, but a kicker?
At this pace, they'll  hit the over, by the start of the 2nd quarter.  Absolute track meet.
If Bama didn‚Äôt know they were in for a fight, they better know now
Where are all you dopes who didn't want this game?

It‚Äôs Joe Flacco on the bench, not Joe Montana.

Nothing lives up to the hype.¬†Especially this horrible game.
No need for the cops to grease the lightpoles tonight.
Philly booing their squad 15 minutes after dropping a banner in the rafters. Never change, Philly. Never change.
More things change, more they stay the same.  Falcons still lame in the red zone.

Case Keenum - legend
WHAT?!?!
Crazy clutch.
What an unbelievable battle between this insane dee and Brees.

Antonio Brown is the best receiver I‚Äôve ever seen
Don‚Äôt like that call at all on 4th and 1
Big score, but Mike Tomlin better come with some of his vaunted "STRAIGHT FIRE" at halftime?

Might be time to give that walk-on kicker a scholarship
Texas has a concrete jaw.
Too easy.  #TEXvsUSC
Texas-USC is more exciting than the fight  #FreeFootball
If we know your name as a judge, that‚Äôs never a good thing. Adelaide Byrd.
#GGG won the fight. Period.
118-110 Canelo is a total joke.
Canelo needs a KO.
Championship rounds next.  Canelo may need them all to win.
Good fight, but not the war we expected.  Not yet.
Now we have a fight.

Conor lost the fight but ripped the night. Burfict goes Burfict. Is Kyrie coming or going? Jungle in 30.
Correct stoppage, but ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been strangled on live tv and came back‚Äù is a great answer
Mayweather-McGregor was so much better than Mayweather-Pacquiao
Conor‚Äôs a warrior. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Tough as hell.
Worth it.
Conor disagrees but it was the correct stoppage.
Conor's done.
Conor didn‚Äôt get him out early the way he said he would.  He‚Äôs in trouble now.
3-3
3-1 McGregor
Floyd knows he's in a fight.
Conor absolutely belongs.  Floyd is going to let him punch himself out
