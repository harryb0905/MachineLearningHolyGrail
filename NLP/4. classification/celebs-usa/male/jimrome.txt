Another chance for the refs to jump in. Great.
Clones,  Any chance this KC Dee can get off the field now?
Where’s Rasheed Wallace when you need him?
Because I trust the refs to get this one right...
Hell of a statement, KC
14-0 feels like 41-0.
The Chiefs know if they win they get to go to the Super Bowl, right?
.@Trevor_Pryce about that Rams’ implosion....
How does THAT guy make THAT mistake?  Brady just let KC right back in the game.
Pats picked up right where they left off last week.  What a badass opening drive.

Snead and McVay pushed everything to the center of the table for a Super Bowl. And they’re on their way.

Dabo coached a game for the ages and then chased it with the best postgame interview ever.
To quote the late Pat Tillman, this is a NICE SWIFT ASS-KICKING.
Trevor Lawrence is 19. And still looks like a grown ass man playing against children
Justyn Ross. Unreal.
Is this Nick Saban Bama or Mike Shula Bama?
#Beatdown
It’s not a fake if everyone knows it’s coming
Remember when everyone said this is the best Bama team ever?
A true freshman is turning Nick Saban’s defense inside out in the national championship.
Tua’s first INT was the worst pass he’s thrown.  And that one was even worse.
Shout out to the NFL teams Tanking For Tua in 2019 and Losing For Lawrence in 2020
How the hell can Saban recruit everything, but a kicker?
At this pace, they'll  hit the over, by the start of the 2nd quarter.  Absolute track meet.
If Bama didn’t know they were in for a fight, they better know now
Where are all you dopes who didn't want this game?
Dabo said to “dominate the moment.” Clemson just did.

It’s not the Super Bowl,  but at least one Eagles fan better be eating some horse crap after that one.
Philly is tough and clutch as hell.  Still.
DOINK!  DOINK!
Bring back the old catch rule.
Chargers learned from the first game, Ravens didn’t.  Anthony Lynn turned John Harbaugh inside out.
It’s Joe Flacco on the bench, not Joe Montana.
Man's game, Anthony Lynn.
Well...maybe
How happy is Philip Rivers to finally have a kicker?
That was a straight hospital job by the Colts.

Back in the Jungle at 12n / 9a today. Stories from Wisco/Colorado and thoughts on Koepka, the Cat, Maryland, and Week 1 of preseason.
Tiger trending above Koepka. Brooks will come out of this with an even bigger chip than he had going in
No better story than Tiger, but no better player than Brooks.  If you didn't know it before, now you do.
Does Koepka even have a pulse?
Never thought I'd see this guy in THIS position again.

Case Keenum - legend
WHAT?!?!
Crazy clutch.
What an unbelievable battle between this insane dee and Brees.
Mike Tomlin probably shouldn’t have spent so much time talking about the Pats.
Blake Bortles to America, “How you like me now?”
Antonio Brown is the best receiver I’ve ever seen
Don’t like that call at all on 4th and 1
Big score, but Mike Tomlin better come with some of his vaunted "STRAIGHT FIRE" at halftime?

Conor lost the fight but ripped the night. Burfict goes Burfict. Is Kyrie coming or going? Jungle in 30.
Correct stoppage, but “I’ve been strangled on live tv and came back” is a great answer
Mayweather-McGregor was so much better than Mayweather-Pacquiao
Conor’s a warrior. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Tough as hell.
Worth it.
Conor disagrees but it was the correct stoppage.
Conor's done.
Conor didn’t get him out early the way he said he would.  He’s in trouble now.
3-3
3-1 McGregor
Floyd knows he's in a fight.
Conor absolutely belongs.  Floyd is going to let him punch himself out
Way to be. https://t.co/eFPAj6ak6l
