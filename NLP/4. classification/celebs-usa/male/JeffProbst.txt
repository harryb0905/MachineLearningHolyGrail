@kaylacarlileart Whoa, that's so cool and funny!  You're good! Why am I not riding shotgun?!  ha!
Question:  I hear you on wanting a longer premiere! Is that a shared desire?  For example, if we had occasional 2-hour episodes would you watch?  Or is 2 hours too long, and too late for kids?  Let me know!  We listen!
I am so happy to say thank you for your #Survivor loyalty.  Last night's premiere of Survivor: Edge of Extinction was #1 @ 8pm in the all important demo.  It's a testament to you always hanging in there with us.  Excited for you to see it all play out! It's just beginning....
East Coast! It's time!  Edge of Extinction begins.....!  I feel safe saying that I think you are going to enjoy this season.  Edge brings another layer to the game.  You'll see a bit tonight, more in the coming weeks.  Thanks for the loyalty.  YOU keep us on the air! #survivor
Sorry to overload you with posts after being gone for so long!!  We've been lucky to have some really thoughtful stories written about Survivor this week.  Someone just sent me this one, so I'm sharing with you guys, the people who make it possible.! https://t.co/bxdUIB3Ryl
The countdown is on.  First two minutes of Survivor: Edge of Extinction... right here!!  RT @Bel_BostonLove: ü§ó üíÉ ü§ó üíÉ Lets do this @JeffProbst #EdgeOfExtinction https://t.co/boePQstYZl
@aiiimz3 awesome pic!
@lbwells11  watched the tape. we will be casting again in late summer.  Next tape, have him tell us about his story. Who is he? Where's he at in life, what matters, what's his driving force, etc whatever is is that captures his essence. You're a good partner to support him.
@lbwells11 Glad to hear it and glad to be back.  Enjoy tonight. Thanks for watching.
@JustinInAtlanta ah but I did!  Bachchat was a blast.  Even if we had to make up some of our own letters!
@WendytheB nice!!
And with each passing week the idea of Edge Of Extinction will become more and more clear... I think you're gonna dig it.  We had a blast doing it.  And the players this season are fantastic!
Let me be clear... :) when I say "fun new idea" I'm not so sure it will be fun for the players... but it will be fun to watch!  And it will push players further than they've ever gone before.  We continue to explore the boundaries, knowing you are with us for the journey.
In preparation for tonight, here's a GREAT look inside the machine that it takes to launch a new season of Survivor.  Very fun article by @daltonross https://t.co/2rJdlQQFHL
Hey guys!  Did ya miss me? I missed you guys!  I am so pumped for tonight!  Edge of Extinction is a fun new idea. We'll give you a taste of it tonight... then a bit more... a little more... just the way you like it.  See if you can persuade one new person to check it out tonight!
Just reminding that we have two episodes tonight!  Back to back!  Great night for #Survivor fans!
Hope you‚Äôre enjoying #DavidvsGoliath! We got great news, there‚Äôs a new episode tomorrow and we just got a premiere date for season 38! The next season of #Survivor will premiere February 20th. https://t.co/yHxwjLbplr

if you want to apply send a video link to me here -- or thru CBS.  We need tape to see who you are and what you're about... you don't have to be a filmmaker.  Just you.  Who are you?  What's your story?  Send me a link!  We want great players who are compelling story tellers!
For those who have yet to watch tonight --- in the first episode I do my personal best to encourage you to apply!  We want people who love the game to get the chance to play it and experience it.  As you can see even from tonights ep #Survivor is a life changing experience.

"You're a fire starrrrrter!"   #survivor
Another great personal moment for someone else in episode one.  Once again same question -- how can you NOT root for him?  #survivor
How can you not root for him?   Come on... that's so many of us... doubting if we can do it but wanting to see... #survivor
We took each tribe to an empty room - they sat there all night.  Silent.  Producers watching over.  They were great sports. #survivor
also just heard we are #1 on Twitter.  That's pretty fun.  Nice work!  #survivor
When you see the shot now you'll know that's the only way we got it. Our crew is amazing.
They got it hooked up, raced to the beach, set it in the trees and angled it on one shot... hoping.
our location guy Michael Glaser just happened to be walking by and said "I have one, I'll be right back!"
for a few hours... but he said if someone had an extended battery for a cell phone that he could hook it up to work with the camera
put a go pro on one of the beaches -- and just see if we might get lucky and catch a shot.  He said yes but the battery would only last
we couldn't leave anybody on the beach to try and film the storm.   So... I asked our point of view guy Andrew if there was any way he could
During the commercial I'll share a somewhat long story about something you're about to see...   because we had to evacuate our crew too...
This was a scary time for all of us, we had to get everybody on our crew to shelter too.  #survivor
two completely different reactions -- one was a celebration, the other true concern  #survivor philosophical differences

Re idol - yes Neal could have given anyone the idol up until he stepped onto the boat to head to hospital.  Guess he wanted a souvenir?

And who will have a jungle visitor in a place nobody wants a jungle visitor... no not there.

And who is the most unlikely odd couple to form a friendship?
Heads up -- have fun watching Debbie's ever changing occupations!  She has so many we had to switch them up!
@TorontoMia29 hmmm I'll have CBS reach out. They have assured me everybody got their buff!  looking into it.

@braves123123 I'll let CBS know and let them decide.  Thanks for the invite!
@Keyes2Survivor they love you!  That's awesome!
@TheDylanTurner I think you'll have a hard time fitting in - but you are fascinating for sure - thanks for applying! Sending onto casting!
@SurvivorShawnS great!  sending it onto casting!
@lydiampitts I don't see it...
@johneggen316 Great way to do it -- honestly you can really get a sense of someone quickly this way - sending it onto casting!
@ApStyle523 like your story, I'll be honest, it's a bit low energy... the brooding writer in you :) I'll send it on but don't stop applying!
@cupcakes_mpls glad you re sent - thanks, very clear who you are -- that's what we need!  I'll send onto casting!
@swiftash Sadly you have to be an American citizen... we only have the rights to do a U.S. version... sorry bout that!
@CaseyAMerrill perfect - exactly what we want in terms of telling us who you are -- I'l send it onto casting!
@sskibbe That's how you do it.  Now we know who you are.  You're interesting - sending it onto casting!
@arielzang This is how to do a tape - straight forward, tell us who you are.  Glad you are healthy - sending it onto casting!

Holy Sh*t @Racheldoesthings is hilarious!  If you haven't discovered, here's a taste. https://t.co/rQUM3OqOVD
@TheEasterwood yes! will send on. It's interesting to me that you are clearly popular and successful but come across a bit low key...
@cupcakes_mpls couldn't get vid to play :(
@johneggen316 Love the Van halen - can you try just sitting somewhere, car wherever and talking to us - tell a story, etc  thanks!
@kathyaulson Just based off this tape, I think the biggest thing is how S has changed.  Players today typically explode with storytelling
@BoeverDam I like yours too.  Really clear who you are, confident story telling. Will pass it on.  Don't stop applying, ok?  Thanks!
@JTCircus Great video.  That's how you do it. Will send onto casting.  What state are you in now?
@honjeddles I'll send it on!
@TheEasterwood take this with love - YOU need to tell us who you are. The point of a video is for us to imagine you on the show. Make sense?
@jessicabrtlett great tape - shows us who you are, shows personality, can see who you would be on the show - sending onto casting!
@mrsbuff2u funny parody :) but for anybody else watching - all we really need is you talking to us!  I'll make sure casting sees it!
For all of you who dream of voting me out... dream no more.  https://t.co/bDPN2uEkjM
@kyleoicc congrats on own biz! Now just send us a tape of you telling us a story - any story. Don't put on any act, just talk -- make sense?
@Idol_Thoughts Not sure yet.  Here's the truth - the pace of shows has gotten faster. :60 for an open is a LONG time now. Most are :10.
@amberastephan you're young and that's the only feedback. :) Very likable.  Maturity really makes a diff.  Not a dig on u at all.
@JustinFWalter I remember that day - you destroyed me.  I'll send it on - good tape. thanks.
I know owning a Tesla is a major luxury, and if you are fortunate enough to enjoy @Teslamotors their at home service is incredible! Thank u!
@Zach4Survivor I think you know I'm joking but just making sure...
@kyleoicc video is private...
@sskibbe Sam, send us a video of YOU telling us your story - not others! :)
@hweb1103 amazing!  wow. do me a favor... turn your phone on and just tell us about you (outside of the story you shared)

@stl_hopeful good tape- straight forward.  Trying 2 figure out where u fit, hero, villain, ..?  will send onto casting. :) Congrats on book!
@dormanea pretty impressive critical thinking.  How old are you?  I'll pass it onto casting! Remember, a lot of people apply...
@AnnAlford40 nothing wrong, It's just timing, you're great. I'll send this to casting!  Don't stop. People have applied 15 yrs - timing...
RT @Rove: @carlyylalaa @Sam_Frost I'm like that every time I see @JeffProbst too üòç So much fun!  Thanks for letting me drop in!  Hi Zoe!

@Acesfull1313 I'll send it on - you're in the right space - if not this time don't stop - I could see you on the show.
@nikkionsurvivor 18 is not a flaw:) just a disadv simply because of life exp.  I'll pass it on, but if not this time, PLEASE keep applying!
@amberastephan passing it on!  Thanks!
@MR_JPOTT grabbed me instantly - this is how you just show us who you are - no big production value, just who you are.  Passing it on.
@realjesserob Good first tape -- now send us one of you just talking - just you -- make sense?
@cole_carnemark What's with all the young guys applying?  I love it!  Sending it on!  Thanks!
@jereknut Are you a hero or a villain?  Passing it on!  Thanks!

@michelleab123 looks like you're doing a pretty good job of keeping a busy life together!  I'll send it on!
@mallory741 Interesting... I'll send it on!  If you end up talking to casting - be yourself.  Meaning, don't feel need to be anything else!
Have you seen Making A Murderer on Netflix? Outraged?  If so join the cause https://t.co/5jDqSiCpqB and if not cancel plans and watch!
@KingPotato027 I'll pass it onto casting -- be sure you don't get too hung up on your family history -- this is about YOU! :)
@kwissingg @wissings21 @Survivor_Tweet So funny!  I'll admit we have one here too and use it to scare friends who stay in guest house.
@Alex_F_says_hi @jsano19 @Survivor_Tweet Jeff, I think it's going to be storytelling that holds u back.  Have to "grab" audience --
@bfeldt @TheIllFatedScum @ScottFeldt @samfeldt that was a blast hanging together!  Great nachos too!  Thanks!
@DebZebMac I'll send onto casting -- but here's a question for you -- will people root for you or against you or worse... neither?
@carldswan Ill send it onto casting.  I think you'll get destroyed but might be fun to watch. :)
@RoSonomaCounty So happy to see this !
@TkicksAss glad you haven't given up!  Likable as last time.  I'll send onto casting!
@robgm400 What a life you've had!!!  Re Survivor, I think storytelling is what is lacking. You have to be able to draw people in quickly.
@livchell really enjoyed our time together.  Thanks for letting me take this selfie.
@SurvivorAJ Ok, try this - tell us one of your best stories of you and your buddies or you on a date, etc unrehearsed - just start...
@maddyflorian @Survivor_Tweet fanastic!
@DMCN12 it's about us seeing your authenticity - wish I had better advice.  Love using Foos in your video!
@DMCN12 Dan, got 2 find a way to let us see "YOU" -- not planned answers - just who are you.  I know it sounds like I'm talking in circles.
@Zackary_Penn @survivorsavage @jeremy2collins I like it.  Nice!  You're young and that will be a disadv but I'll send onto casting!
@BF_TheFish very cool list!
@BlindsideBonta Saw vid. You are a nice guy -- I can tell.  I believe you know the game, but I don't think you're ready yet. Don't give up.

@Raddmom I love conspiracy theories.  Did you catch how I "forced" them to take certain buffs.  Pretty good eh?  Nobody caught it.
@BeerCelina always and forever.... right back atcha.
@lesurvivant1611 It's called a twist.  Luck of the draw.  Fate.  It's Survivor, baby.
@rougewarrior715 good question... no idea.  I think a good short term memory or just lucky.
@KaleeBee217 oh man that makes me feel super old.
@TerezRae Ah that is SUPER COOL!  Books 4 and 5 are out, 6 on the way!  Great work.  Impressive.
.. @mindygreenberg Happy Birthday!! @StevenBirnbaum1
@bridgetmcmanus What up Bridge!
@Perezpective Congrats!
@rales9 Pretty sweet.
@VCWinSin What up Malaysia!  Where it allllll started!
@PickMe4Survivor have you sent in a regular audition tape? :)
@gabrielletozer Weird.  I had the same dream.
@alliebubba123 ha!  There is no sex tape.  Funny.
@TrainerKelsey You'll be getting it soon - I just have to get them mailed!
@SeanHCrow is that on the CBS website?  That's hilarious.
@Smallrose99 It's a good life :)
@Claybeaux69 I dig it.  Passing you onto casting.  Nice video.  Just walking and talking - that's what we need to see who you are.
@CranstonAb Keeps things fair.  If they are both identical then there is no chance one would ever be deemed "easier"
@ibellamorgan It worked.
Really fun tweeting with you all last night!  Great episode, great ratings.  We keep doing it together!!  #Survivor
@gjohnson075 Love that you appreciate that and understand it.  I agree :) The players are giving us truly amazing stories to tell.
Until next time..... :)  #survivor
I really enjoyed tonight!  I'll give away more buffs I promise.  Thank you for playing along with me.  Blast!! #survivor
ah man --I'm so sorry for west coast I just realized... spoiler.  Man!  I hate myself. Sorry. This is hard to do without give away #survivor
Say it!  Who is going home?  Shirin or Spencer?  #survivor
I love these players.  They are so open and honest.  This theme of second chance resonates with me.  does it with you guys?  #survivor
This is why Survivor is ultimately a social game.   Social politics.  #survivor
and what is great about the game now is that tribal can change everything.  You are not safe until the vote is over.  #survivor
It's amazing how fast this game can break you down... makes you so vulnerable... #survivor  NOW who is going home?
Desperation is setting in.....  you can feel it.... it's awful.   #survivor
This is where the game gets really tough.  WHO do you trust?  #survivor
This is how fast the game can change.  It's like this all day every day.  Never safe.  #survivor
I have to compliment our crew - the coverage of that scene/argument was amazing.  We have a great team.  #survivor
yes @JoeMantegna is as cool in person as he is on tv.  Cool, laid back... nothing ruffles him.  @JoeMantegna
Watching with the #Criminal MInds cast... they're either thinking this show is really good.. or what the hell is this show?  #survivor
So predictions... who is going home?  #survivor
And she WON!  Crazy right?  #survivor
RT @1104denise: @JeffProbst Tina #Survivor You got it!  Nice job!  BUFF!  #survivor
Which contestant from Survivor: Australia was a last minute replacement?  For a buff!  #survivor
RT @olmec26: @JeffProbst Charlie Parsons YES!!  He did an experiment on an island with a few couples....  BUFF!  #survivor
Okay -- who created Survivor?  For a buff!  #survivor
That's a tough puzzle.  Have a duplicate in my garage.  Love to test friends!  #survivor
This challenge burned the Survivors the first time we did it and it's about to do it again.... #survivor
Wow, all the #criminal minds cast just walked in -- they're up next. Very cool!
And this is why so many of you want to play Survivor.  Because you can't get this fun anywhere else.  #survivor
These challenges are NO JOKE.  Those are hard falls. Nowhere to hide.  #survivor
A lot of skin coming off the body when they go down the wood... #survivor
Big immunity challenge - this one will kick their ass!!  #survivor
Too bad Bayon didn't find their idol clue... would have been fun challenge to hide an idol.  See @ew tomorrow for behind the scenes on this!
RT @caylenbelcourt: @JeffProbst 11 #survivor less than 5 seconds!  BUFF!!!  #survivor
How many players were given the opportunity to play but ended up quitting?  #survivor
Hmmm do they find her to be a "joy?"  Or is that what they're saying?   I love this game... #survivor
And we are only 5 days in...  still so early in the game.  So much to come.  #survivor
@katehol51763278 Duly noted :)  Tell him hey from me!!
This is what Deitz has been wanting to work on - his social game.  Can he turn this into a good strategic move as well? #survivor
Now here is another great moment coming up... that speaks to second chance stories and how people change their game...  #survivor
Man you guys are fast!  Pretty good ep so far right?  Great emotion, argument and strategy... and we're not even half way!  #survivor
RT @zchryd: @JeffProbst Francesca FAST!  Buff coming my friend!   #survivor
Okay ---  who was the only person voted out first... twice?  go!   #survivor
RT @kamf0rd: @JeffProbst spencer and rudy SWEET!  Buff coming!!  #survivor
Okay more buffs -- who is our oldest and youngest competitor?  #survivor
don't forget to hashtag :)   #survivor
How many Jeremy fans do we have?  #survivor
And now we'll see the downside of your truth coming up... it can make it hard to be there...  #survivor
This is one of the nice things that Survivor does for/to you.. it strips you so bare... your truth comes up.  Fully.  #survivor
This is a great moment for romance.... #survivor
Oh my god, this is delicious!  Jeff Varner  love it!  #survivor
So do we believe Abi has changed?  Is she capable of changing?  #survivor
RT @ashtonmentzxd: @JeffProbst #Survivor 17 females 13 males YOU GOT IT!  Buff coming!  #survivor
One more quick question -- 30 winners.  How many male v female?  #survivor
Share... who do you have as a winner?  Who is your pick?  #survivor
RT @TrainerKelsey: @JeffProbst 1 outback! that's it!  BUFF coming your way!  #survivor
Okay for a buff - first to answer.... how many seasons and in which country have we shot more than 39 days?  #survivor
I love Varner.  He's a great storyteller.  Do you trust him?  #survivor
@TorontoMia29 Close enough!  Buff coming your way!!! #survivor
I'm supposed to ask you again to include #survivor in your tweets :)  Let's trend people!
Ah this is one of my favorite parts of this episode... right here....  #survivor
Look at those beautiful images... Cambodia is truly stunning.
Okay nobody got all of them!  more to come -- let's start the episode!  Please include our hasthag -- #survivor
Let's get started with an early question.... which countries have we been to more than once?
You don't have to be watching the episode to win a buff - it won't be related to the episode.  Just catch my eye or maybe I'll have a Q!
For west coasters I promise to do my very best to not give anything away from my tweets - can't guarantee anybody else.  :)
Are you ready?  Let's do it!  Gonna be fun!  gonna be giving away buffs tonight!  I have 20 to give away.  20!
Heading out! Live tweeting 2nite. Hoping to hear from lots of young fans too! 8,9,10,11,12! Love that so many of u have discovered Survivor!
@emilyelarsen Ah I'm afraid I might disappoint.  How bout a tweet instead? :)

@PaulParmar1 Yeah, pretty sure we reached out.  She was definitely on our list.
@RHAPfan12 That's fantastic!  @robcesternino Wish I could be there for it.  Very cool.  Have a great night!

@gjkooijman you too of course!
@IamSilverPeace I remember that -- it was my "official number" that you had to have to sign in to pass thru security.  Crazy!
@ohmyheckgirl Hey Neleh, that's awesome!  You've got a healthy fan base that's for sure!

@slotjockey777 Oh, I am so sorry. What a tremendous loss.  Hopefully watching Survivor will become something that connects you to her.

Remember -only 2nd chancers and no winners. So either Mike or Carolyn didn't win -or one of them could become ineligible. Vote just in case!
RT @SurvivorFan22: @JeffProbst really awesome to see u give @robcesternino  praise. All his hard work on #rhap is a gift!  He's a LEGEND.
@rhonda14e well it is a "2nd chance" and he's played more than twice :)
Love @robcesternino podcast. He's a great interviewer!  Lots of 2nd Chancers being featured too! http://t.co/JCOY36UmvT
fun article from @joereid re 2nd chancers.  Some of his names were on our original list.  Sadly had to pare it down. http://t.co/YimdtxV4eg
@CathylovesSNL ah bummer, who'd we miss!  It was hard to put the list together for sure!
Second chance voting is off the charts!  The top 10 list is changing daily.  Very cool! Your votes are having impact. 8 days of voting left!
After finale, bid on items like this "one of a kind", 4X3 Survivor logo made from 100 buffs from 30 seasons. Amazing. http://t.co/yhH8arjEgO
RT @Matty_B402: @JeffProbst @Survivor_Tweet why no @RC_Survivor ?? Sadly she turned us down... but we understood.
RT @broussegris: @JeffProbst making it sound like the 20 vote-getters leaving for  IMMEDIATELY after the reunion  HOW COOL IS THAT.    YEP!
@DakotaZulu Dream on!  I will never let you see the final votes. I'm going to manipulate them to put on all my favs!  (evil laugh)
re 2nd Chancers revealing something about this season... did we spoil it?  Have we gotten sloppy? Hmmm...  http://t.co/CqPPBaJj3D
You know that point where you're at a party and you realize you should have left twenty minutes ago..?  Uh yeah.  Goodnight.
I love you guys, but some of you need to put down the drink.  You crack me up!  Just enjoy the POWER of choosing the cast.  It's massive.
RT @JiglesiassJohn: @JeffProbst why are we voting for someone filling up space for someone else who could be on ?    Come on people. Think.
RT @dougwatchin: @JeffProbst Mike and Carolyn don't know yet who won, even with season shot, no one's won S30 til votes are read. Exactly!
@MTDenham that's why it's so fun to do!
I'm so confused!. So many decisions.  So many twists.  So many choices.  What's a fan to do? :)  VOTE FOR YOUR FAVS! Don't sweat the rest!
Let's see.. rules say "only played once...didn't win."  So either Mike/Carolyn didn't win ... or... one of them could become ineligible...?
Hmm... was it a spoiler to put Carolyn and Mike on 2nd chance ballot? Should someone be fired? Or Is it a twist?  Or... something else?
RT @KaysGramma: @JeffProbst So does anyone ever say "Shut the f%*#k up Jeff!" during one of these challenges? #Survivor OFTEN!
@blue4t look under your front mat.  enjoy!
@nursebevo now hang on here a second, those are two very different choices!! Go strong, my shirts are cooler!
@marynyeholt Love it!  Books 4 and 5 out too!  The adventure gets bigger!
@joannamckey what up!! Happy birthday little one...!!
RT @JeffProbst: RT @DaveNavarro: @JeffProbst This look about right? #survivor http://t.co/uEOpGUi1fI  And it's going next to the quote!
RT @DaveNavarro: @JeffProbst This look about right? #survivor http://t.co/uEOpGUi1fI  AWESOME!  Just wish being a rock star was as easy...
RT @galijandrooo: @JeffProbst THEYRE BRINGING JOE BACK PLEASE PLEASE @Janglim21 And he's taking over as host!  And EP! And Big Brother too!
#survivor We're making a very big and very fun announcement at the end of tomorrow's episode.  I hope you dig it!  Should be a lot of fun!
@Lucs_Bailiwick Hi sis, "anything nice" --- is that what you were hoping for? :)  Happy Birthday!!  Jeff
@EdwardafSillen Thanks man, I really appreciate the nice words.
@ducci07 Happy belated Birthday!
@celebula we never got you out here!
@PauleyP I'll see ya there!  Look forward to catching up!
@FrankOctober bummer.  maybe next season.  If not, thanks for hanging in so long.
@theCurtDevine why don't you come?  I'll ask you the questions, I know you'll be awesome!  Can't wait!
It will definitely be a topic at the live reunion show on May 20th!
But showing it, letting people speak honestly about it, is the way you bring it to light.  I hope that makes sense.
In NO WAY do I condone degrading comments about women or domestic violence.  I have a mom, a wife, a daughter.  It's disgusting.
For all of u so mad at me -  keep in mind -- when I'm in host role my job is to ask questions, not share personal opinions.
RT @calabocavitu: @JeffProbst hali jenn joe and shireem were the only nice ones I hate everyone left  You are clearly not alone. :)
@katehol51763278 What up!
@reidnakamura dude you need to get your pov figured out.  you're all over the map.
@mfratto sorry to lose you.
@OmerDaniel okay I get it.  Surprised no love for anybody but hear ya.
@JanelleLea That's funny.
RT @hesa: @JeffProbst please tell me these people are killing your will to live too! Just awful. I don't condone. Live show will address.
@canucksjedi but lots of people to root against!  There's always fun in that!
RT @ReadDaSyllabus: @JeffProbst: really hoping that u address the misogamy  @the reunion.  COUNT ON IT. Once season is over convo gets real.
@superderek awesome pic, where'd you find that?!
I don't remember a season that had such opposing views!  Some of u LOVE it some  HATE it, nobody in the middle! Oh well, no stopping it now!
@tinaclean What up Canada!
@heyjoshua__ done.
Ah twitter, it's always a toss up...which is more fun 2 read? The positive feedback or the hilarious ways some of you complain and critique!
@niaglonso dude or dudette, give it a rest. Watch, don't watch. :)  Up to you.  I like this season a lot.  That's all I'm saying!
holy smokes a lot of love for @Janglim21 ---  we gotta find a way to get him back!  I hear ya!  Note taken.
@DickLongYo Thank you!  Hali is a beauty and a smartie too!
@jazleff Right on!!
RT @ritterstein: @JeffProbst pls RT &amp;amp; help me get my #Dreamjob  #Norway http://t.co/94I7NSAeIP  http://t.co/J3ENUBODgB I voted! Awesome!
@lovesdresses Ah I feel badly, definitely didn't have that intention.  Just having fun! A slippery slide and they had some pretty big falls.
@wehaay Bring it!
Hey Survivor fans!  Hope you are digging the season.  More drama to come!  Thanks for keeping Survivor ratings so high!
@plainviewsue Ah sorry man -- I really dig it.  That's why I rarely predict - everybody always has their own opinion.  Total respect.
@SurvivorQuotesX Ah such a fun moment!
@clammyODDParke_ Ha!  Sorry you took it so hard.  Just having fun.  I admire every single person who gets out there and tries!
@Survivor_Talk Don't put it out there!
@jhunderhill That is one of the coolest things I've ever seen!

@raymaxxp dude, why the negativity? :) You're already worried about next year... enjoy the ride.  WC BC NC gonna be fun!
@LegalEagle104 we picked this theme AFTER we had cast :)  we learned our lesson!
based on what I'm hearing from fans so far - this is the season to call your friends and encourage them to watch! #survivorworldsapart

@carloszjulian @tannerduriann @Spencooll  indulge your buddy - give him one episode.  if you're not in, then you can walk away....
@MorganStradling What?!  That's impressive.  Australian buff and a grappling hook.  In the words of Shark Tank, I'm out.  You win.
@MorganStradling That's what I'm talking about!!
@Survivor_Tweet that was awesome!  Nice job CBS!!
In fact, this is the season to call a friend who doesn't watch and challenge them - just ONE episode - if they aren't in, they never will be
I know I'm supposed to let you tell me if a season is good or not -  but I'm gonna go out on a limb - I really like this group - PLAYERS!!
@MorganStradling show me yours I'll show you mine
@BillyGardell dude, you rocked it!  Congrats!
@MaraReinstein what up!  I love that you are such a big part of the Survivor family.  Thanks for the nice note.

@akcober I hear your complaint but remember - most people that we get "from" LA are recent transplants - their "roots" are not LA!
@Lyndzzz Cool!  Haven't seen it yet - looks awesome!
@SurvivorWizard That's not my world but I thought he was doing a good job!  Give him another shot!
@daveomcd I haven't seen it!  Awesome!!!  We worked so hard to come up with a name that @sternshow fans would get!
@LFerenc13 Look at that hat!  Nothing like seeing and hearing all of your bad choices over 15 years... over and over!  Enjoy!
@jessemcquay They... did.... not!  You'll have to watch their reactions when they find out - I was curious if they would feel they belonged.
@AidenRaccoon That was an unfortunate mistake.  An old promo ran!  But they caught it quickly and fixed it!
@wpunyalack It's about time in show! :) We have so much fun stuff that we've cut the open down.  Lots of shows have short opens now....
@heartOfston man what was that... I think it might have been an Indian.  We rented it because we wanted a "classic" - that was a blast!
@HeatherTee_ it's getting really close - need to get on it today!

@clamperls you will ultimately decide... but I liked it a lot.
@KarlAstreet totally get it.  just come back :)
@truedorktimes Done it for years.  All part of strategy of who you send - they miss tribe politics but chance at idol.
@ScottNY71 Can't keep people hostage... I think there's a law about it.
@ericcolston Yes on 30, can't promise on talking to everybody.  Have to keep the show moving....
@logsupacoowacky lots of times we give four days for final episode...
@conorsmyyyth I'm GOING!  Going!  Going!
@nicole_taher as they are played.
@julesgules21 Let's see #56 I'll be roughly 60 something... I'll still be able to swing a snuffer - bring it!
@mtnzfran What did I stir up?  They stirred that up on their own.
@survs18 can't promise that...
@robstaboobuzzer ah yes... back when anything was possible.
@s_baerg but avoiding "being screwed" is part of the game.
@Mclovin71789 Interesting... time clock on idols.  Good idea.

Gearing up for #survivorfinale - post your Q's here - I might end up using them!  WED Dec. 17th 8-10 finale followed by reunion 10-11

#survivorfinale going into the finale predictions on who will win and who you want to win?
#survivorfinale what do you want me to discuss at the reunion show?  Topics, questions?  Bring it or forever hold your peace!

@Keyes2Survivor Love the license plate!  I'm sorry we don't have tickets :(
@ATLangela This is a question?  Really?  Come on... it's easy. :)
#survivor finale quick poll - Who was in the wrong in the Jaclyn v Jon argument?  Share your thoughts we'll talk about it Wed at finale!

@achadwanabe # of players in game.  Draw rocks until a final 4, then fire.  But that promo was mistake.  No rocks drawn this week. But 2 eps
RT @tombo2407: @JeffProbst why would #Survivor promo during Pats game give away they are drawing rocks this week?!!?  That was a mistake.
@sarahbassy based on your bio quote I'm guessing you won.
@DeannaJim2012 sweeet!

@Theresa5959 Ah but I'd be out so fast....
Survivor fans I'm soliciting your favorite scenes/moments from seasons past - especially the more recent ones maybe S20 on-- let me have it!
RT @goldmanstandard: .@DaltonRoss  "how fast" you can complete this @JeffProbst challenge: http://t.co/id0IRb4RfK fun for Survivor fans!
@MaryrRathke The way you did it was perfect - just talking about who you are, etc - just do it again up close!
@MaryrRathke It would help if you could be a bit closer to camera so we can actually see you and hear you and get a better sense of you !
@BNels15 I think you could be great, but just need a little more time -- but hey I am only one opinion so I will send it onto casting!
@MarkBSalter Sounds really interesting!  I should probably take your course!
@MaryrRathke awesome moment and discovery in your life!  Beautiful!
@BapBrett I can't lie... what is the point... I don't think this tape will get you seen.  It's just lacking spark.  You asked.... :)
@steavio so I've been told...
@kmoresize That's adorable, thanks for sharing.
@johneggen316 I'm in.  You are a true no collar.  Hope we get to meet.  Don't change.  Sending it to casting.

@SurvivorAJ You're likable, I'm just not sure you're ready -- but that's only one opinion -- I'll send it onto casting see what they think!
@leslejean I like it.  Sending it onto casting.  Hope we get to meet!
@joshrumple You're a talented writer!  But what we need is to see who you are - really.  Who are you?  Make sense?
@celebula I think you have to follow me for me to respond to DM -
@bridgetmcmanus hi bridget!!!
@mallorypatricia ocean (aqua dump) or woods
@peejay491 ah bummer...
@celebula i think you'd be welcome - can explain via dm
@Todd_Garner AWESOME!!!

@moonyos eerie very eerie
@EganJ That's funny!
@naddddiiaa Love sharing it together!!
@AndrewShayde love it!!!
@karmac831 ah but you'd miss it so...
@AloSmith007 u r great filmmaker!   But we need to see who you are as person - just you - talking, etc telling us who you are!
@IAMWillBeck you seem like a nice guy, gone thru a lot :( I think issue is your laid back attitude/dry sense of humor- but I'll send on!
RT @Rove: http://t.co/6hbGyiguLb Rove, come home to where you belong.
@titan24maniac I like your tape too.  Sent it onto casting.  Thanks for applying, hope we get to meet!
@joe_medina76 I liked it.  Sent it onto casting. You are clearly a man of service and you have a beautiful family too!  Congrats!
@SurvivorChelsea Chelsea I have watched your tape many many times :)  and passed it onto Lynne. :)
@theo2factor I sent this onto casting!  Hope you hear from someone.  What up Wichita!
but if you have some time go watch @jonbellion BTS on youtube of Definition and then go listen to song - great journey watching art form
gotta be honest feel badly downloading @jonbellion free from his website, would rather pay for his work - did I miss it on Itunes?
@jonbellion I'm o'ding on your stuff right now.  Showing our daughter the magic of art coming together without filters!  You rock!
RT @Deflectt: @jonbellion @JeffProbst @mpollackmusic why aren't any of yr songs on iTunes :(  because they're free at http://t.co/1vGSMy739Q
@DroppinTweets47 Happy Birthday @uuuumaga   go listen to some @jonbellion that will make your day!

@dugmar68 lots of practice :)
@ButMomma what do you mean gives too much away?  Explain so I can understand. Thanks!
#survivor Love your ideas for how to deal w quitters - it's tricky.  You can't force anybody to stay. It's ultimately their choice.
@dcstink Hear ya on that...
@eri_caleb That is awesome!! Did you do that?  Really funny.
@elonmusk We enjoyed hanging with you the other night!  Let's do it again soon.
#survivor our gut was if Rocker was voted out early Julie would have a hard time staying in-that's what I mean when I say we have to own it.
#survivor thanks for another great ratings night last night.  As always love the back and forth and honesty with your reactions --
@milesismyhero @DanielsEscape @MorganStradling Damn, the worst?  Bummer. But fact remains, we have to own Julie's quit.  Our bad.
@TheScottPainter what up!  Fun times the other night!  Let's do it again.
@robEhed I passed it on.  He's interesting.  Thanks for passing it on.
@AdventureHen scripted?  huh?  what show you watching?
@JappyPrincess ah man you should have said hey!  baba booey back atcha
@psyd_grl he's awesome.  Has he read STRANDED?  It's Survivor for kids - he might dig it.
@ConnorCharm1 I watched. I will pass on to casting but I do think there will be concern that the elements will be tough for you -
@JordanAtkins2 fantastic outfits!

Morning! As a parent the issue of bullying is a big one for me, this video offers another voice another reminder http://t.co/CT1xJzMJ0p
@BonusCut sweet!
#survivor truly starving just isn't an option for many reasons.  So you just try to negotiate a fair trade.
#survivor ok, as much as u sadists want them to starve - put your producer hat on - if they truly run out of food/energy your season suffers
@glickdefied really? what did you want?
@Cooperproject that's funny
@kathluvsgh yep
@Event_Full what up!
#survivor if you're bored waiting for Survivor to start check out these pics, captions explain and will make sense http://t.co/gfOQNK2C6h
@JillyFitness wait, weren't you sending in an audition tape?
@Kennylloyd4753 you say wager -- what are you putting up?
@AngieWi87079268 What mean?  There's Survivor tonight.  8pm east and west, 7 pm central!
@JacobLorsung Either way is good brotha - understand the occasional distraction!
#survivor love the excitement around the rice situation.  They ATE all their rice this early in the game.  Invoice has to be steep.  Right?
@japotts25 I'll send it onto casting.  I think we should meet you.  We'll see what they think.
RT @justme2you: @JeffProbst wow, they have that many people around them 24/7? No, that is the opening of this season. Crew at camp is small.
@wondertwin97 I understand.  DVR us and watch tomorrow!
@BuffoonMike I get it.  DVR us and watch tomorrow.
oh and I also took over instagram tonight! behind the scenes photos and captions!  http://t.co/gfOQNK2C6h

@TheNotoriousJ0E I'd say odds are very high!
@NicoletteWodz Ah thank god you agree.  Was worried I'd gone too far.
@KPossible7 That's funny
@61tel We tear them down so we leave the environment the same or better than we found it.
Excited to support @EGPAF &amp; an #AIDSFreeGen thru a fun family event tomorrow #ATFH25: http://t.co/8kpVjwvKKa hope to see some of you there!
@IAMWillBeck no idea - just post it or send it in - megabytes don't matter!  Just 3 minutes
@legaleagle48 they're always different.  Lately the same person makes them for me.
@Bigskye1144 it's because the scripts are so good and the actors are so believable!
@DinoBonoBambino I know!
@mkrog25 black baby.  love it but it's hot!
@Oklahoma_dude yes.  they have to remain quiet. they can change their minds re the vote but they can't talk about it.
RT @faiz_yusoff: @JeffProbst is the lightning strike happen on every tribal council? Or did u guys CGI it? üòÑ 100% real.  100%.  Crazy, eh?
@the_real_coach For sure you are!!  Nothing but love and respect.  Hope you play again one day!
@Geneise Mostly they are mostly columbia - but the key is we A) tailor them and B) dye them.  A luxury for sure, but that's why they fit.
#survivor hi west coast!  just checking in!
@Survivor_Fan090 if you were contacted it will get there - just takes us a bit of time to get them out!
@LeglessLush Oh, I am so sorry!  You're right, because of the other woman I thought you were saying hi.  I'm so sorry I didn't realize...
@vanMathuysen no I'm sorry I don't.  I've read a bunch of stuff but no definitive books.  Sounds fun!  Good luck!

Really hope you liked last nights episode - see ya Rocker.  Once again you guys made #Survivor the #1 show in ti's time period. Thank you!
#survivor another EXPLOSIVE episode tonight!  I think you'll enjoy it -but... for various reasons!  Can't wait to hear your reactions!

@PKinHollywood just happened to see this-  good luck to you!  Don't let the business of Hollywood stand in your way of gettin foot in door!
@JillyFitness DO IT!  Send me link let's see what you got.

#survivor what a fun night!  These hours whip past!  CriminalMinds and Stalker are gonna tweet tonight too!  Hope you have fun!
#survivor I had Val to win.  Shows what I know about this game.  29 seasons in and still learning!
#survivor bye bye Val.  I think she overplayed it.  Claiming an idol after being away from the tribe from day one is a risky move.
@RobertaBowden one of my favorite corny lines... BUFF!
#survivor now who goes home?
#survivor  2nd person voted out is....

#survivor  you can see the energy drain out of Missy...
#survivor think how you would feel... popping your own daughter in the mouth.
#survivor it's about to get... ugly.
This is a great match up... mom vs daughter....  what do you do when you have to battle your child?  Very tough...
#survivor  You HAVE to call that an upset.  Huge win for the other Jon!

#survivor  How many of you like nadiya and natalie from AR?  How many disliked?

RT @Ricardooooooooo: @JeffProbst may 31, 2000 BUFF!!!  Nice job.  Very fast!!
#survivor What date did Survivor premiere?
@michaeldnorris Just seemed funny - fireman deals with fire and loses flint.  No direct correlation just thought it was funny

@han_scriv_kev my bad.  I know I was supposed to check in with you first.  I totally forgot. I'll stick with what you normally write for me.
@inac88 pretty close to the truth... minecraft.
@JamesMee15 started as a way to engage and then became part of the language of the show, now it's just fun and funny to keep repeating it
@truedorktimes funny
@JCMauthe ah but don't you kind of enjoy the hope that maybe.. one day... I'll surprise you...?
@LuLuCornbread right up my alley - sweet.
@DomyB043 not bad.
RT @JohnMCochran: @JeffProbst leave it to me, bro. I've been waiting my whole life for something like this to come up YEAH BABY!!! Bring it!
RT @goatmeal69: @JeffProbst why not try a season of first outs?  put together two tribes of ten and tell me if you are still interested :)
@RFPBloodrath They're always based on local tribes or local names - that's why.  You might miss them if they disappeared completely!
@TrentonGGames imagine yourself on the show, imagine your story, then tell us about who you are -- it's all about ability to be compelling!
@SarahxCu Funny --
RT @MClemmer2007: @JeffProbst are your previous one liners scripted? Why wait until S31? Scripted?  Never. Nothing is scripted. It's "live!"
RT @DEWcanDEW: @JeffProbst  Let fans name the tribes?  Put up 5 options + fans vote online?  That would be a great new facet. Interesting...
@lpressle66 was bummed that phrase upset people.  My intention is pure encouragement.  Use of "woman" is not meant with any disrespect -
RT @shelliecinder: @JeffProbst "Bye for now" ;) ah love this...
RT @JasonCSS12: @JeffProbst Take a cue from @RyanSeacrest - "Results.... AFTER the BREAK!" I love that we never do that --
@SFBayAreaGirl had I known the show was going to last 15 years I would have given it more thought!
RT @Magitroopa: @JeffProbst "Let's see who it is this time!" vs "I'll read the votes" at tribal council. maybe if this was for 3rd graders.
Okay clearly I messed this up - here's a good audition tape - just take notice of how he tells his story @mjfo111: http://t.co/OI45XsqVEi
RT @mjfo111: @JeffProbst long time fan.. audition tape http://t.co/DczJce5qzt‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ my bad, I musta clipped the link :) possible future player?
Starting with season 31 I will be looking for some new "one liners" so feel free to share ideas... I just want to freshen things up a bit!
RT @slymbojenkins: .@JeffProbst why do you say "I'll go tally the votes"? You go collect the votes then tally them. public education?
RT @mjfo111: @JeffProbst Hey, Jeff, long time fan - watch my audition tape http://t.co/DczJce5qzt This guy has a shot to get on the show
@MichaelPoke Isn't that Redemption Island :)?
RT @TimBoucher33: @JeffProbst - B4 a reward challenge, pls stop asking "want to know what you're playing for?" They ALWAYS do!! NEVER!
@JamesThuma very interesting... it's going in the creative hopper!
RT @themoms:"Kids don't think when we read, we just want the adventure" quoted from @JeffProbst on @SIRIUSXM meaning they suspend disbelief!
@Ari_bacher interesting idea... thanks for sharing that who knows maybe one day you'll see elements of that on the show!
@scottduncanfilm creates our opens and he LOVES that you love them.  It wasn't his decision... and it wasn't made without a lot of thought..
@lordnicolas_ was discussed but upon examination it has a lot of problems...
@texasrose99 I'll take it
@Dwarnter We just try to put on a cross section of America - to the best of our ability - based on who applies, etc
@slotjockey777 Shark Tank!
@Jbird81Jane Doesn't feel right... there's a disconnect when not at all involved in tribal politics...
@andystowe Love to have CD back!
@mick_cloudy Yes!  Congratulations!!!
@Bwick2011 could be...
@jdiddy2010 holla!
@CCasole332 cool idea, but do you think @RussellHantz would last a day given how much animosity other players have toward him?
@snapsurvivorjef Wow.  Those are ridiculously funny!
@TheReviewWeekly depends on the season... we just try new things, you never know for sure what will work - it's an ongoing experiment
@dirk_twerkstein great question... so many new choices -- tony and kass, tasha and spencer, jeff kent, abi marie, hayden, Cierra, fun idea!
@gbrandehoff ha!  You may be the only one....!
@ItsMeToniV They're coming -- later this season!
Sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're annoying and sometimes... they truly are helpful!
Hey Survivor fans, I do read ur comments and I really do appreciate all of them - sexist, overblown, boring, cocky.. keep speakin ur truth!
@BesonTanya not enough GREAT characters - we've tried...
@MissLove2Blog I appreciate how much you like the open.  It's a creative decision that I know disappoints you.  Hope you can understand.

@truedorktimes Ah thanks for asking.  It's my kids adventure series!  Survivor for kids!  Order now I really think you'll dig it!  ha!
#survivor also tomorrow after the Survivor 90 min premiere is the finale of Big Brother!  Double dose!
#survivor There is a supertease at the end of ep one.  Teases some of the things that will happen this season but not who they happen to!
@Estoops Wahoo!  I've got company in my group!
@TikiVTiki full intro is gone.  TV has changed.  Audience wants more story less main title.  Hope that makes sense!
#survivor Are you ready? :)  I am!  Episode one is 90 minutes.  It's fun.  Different types of players than we have seen in a while.
@AnnAlford40 Awesome!
#survivor Heading to ET to tape a bit w Julie Chen for Wednesdays double header: Survivor 90 min premiere and Big Brother 90 min finale!
#survivor okay we can officially start the countdown to season #29.  Monday.... Tuesday.... WEDNESDAY!!!! Survivor: Blood v Water II

flying to JFK on Jet Blue - holy smokes the "Mint" experience is really sweet.  If you get the chance to check it out, it's worth it!
Hey Moms!  The newest "Stranded" is out.  Kids adventure book series, kids 7-12.  Survivor for kids :) http://t.co/jIIIrhC12V
@JamieRJohnstone hey, do another tape - get to it.  Just tell us who you are - Survivor is all about people.  Their truth.  Good luck.
Re Rocker, Survivor has always been about a cross section of America. Different pov's forced to work together. They can always vote him out.
Hope you're enjoying the promos for Survivor: Blood v Water - 10 days till the premiere!
@bcampbell1026 Don't do it!
@sandar61 "Defend" is stretching it a bit... :) I don't condone. Survivor is it's own society, if folks don't like Rocker they vote him out.
@DebbieStarkman love seeing that pic!  Makes me smile.
@bridgetmcmanus What up!!!
@andrealeemis That pleases me so much!  We have a new trilogy after he finishes that one!  It's called Shadow Island, first one just out!

RT @LuLuCornbread: @JeffProbst @Mom2Katie020813 Awesome! I have given your books as gifts to my 12 yr old nephew -he loves em! Tell him hey!
RT @sanders_jeff: @JeffProbst my 10 year old son loves the #stranded books    Nice work! Ah I love hearing that.  Thanks for passing it on
*Strandedchat They don't hesitate to tell u if ur boring!  And they've come up with some great ideas that we use in the book!
#strandedchat of kids who read the books early and give me advice.  It's one of the best parts of the process.
RT @JasonNickless16: @JeffProbst do u let your kids read the book before the final draft to see if your audience likes it? I have an army
#strandedchat everywhere.  You can buy Stranded at Amazon or B &amp;N, they're in book stores, Scholastic book fairs at school, lots of places
RT @JillyFitness: @JeffProbst Make sure to tell people where to buy the books! So nice of you to take time to chat with us -they're avail..
RT @LuLuCornbread: @JeffProbst @Mom2Katie020813 you have kids?? Yes, 10 and 8.  Boy and girl.  We are a blended family.
#strandedchat something cool or funny or heroic -- is based on them!  But isn't that how it should be?
RT @WantDDUBLovin: @JeffProbst What do your kids think of the books?  #strandedchat Ha, they think every moment in which a kid does ...
RT @cg_grosz: @JeffProbst @Survivor_Tweet I'm glad u did a book about blended families!  We have a blended fam 14 years it's great! AWESOME!
#strandedchat their new siblings and realizing they like them more than they thought they would at first!  It's incredibly bonding for them.
#strandedchat their courageous parts of themselves.  They overcome real fears, they risk death, and through it all they are getting to know
#strandedchat These kids learn to rely on each other, trust their instincts, they learn that they are capable of so much more, they tap into
#strandedchat life lessons.  That's the underbelly of all of it.  When you are faced with crisis you either step up or u r in trouble.
RT @ElawReads: @JeffProbst R u trying to teach anything in your novels? Wisdom? Or just entertaining? #Strandedchat  There are LOTS of...
#strandedchat we r a blended family so we share the kids - so we have "breaks" which are good/bad. U can catch up, but you really miss them.
#strandedchat our kids are perfect of course, so no!  Ha!  I do understand the Q.  You just have to try to balance it all out. But remember
RT @Mom2Katie020813: @JeffProbst #StrandedChat Is it hard to get work done at home w kids when you're not shooting for #Suvivor?  Well...
RT @5150forSports: @JeffProbst @jonnyjazzno don't sweat, big fan since Rock and Roll Jeopardy! R &amp; R Jep!  Good times!
#strandedchat then u start to fine tune it and then u do a very tight pass to really tighten it up.  It does take longer than u might guess
#strandedchat On avg it takes about 3 months to write one.  You have to have the idea, then you outline, then a very rough draft --
#strandedchat we shoot Survivor over the summer, then we are home rest of year editing.  So I do have time to write.  As for how long ...
RT @barrman: @JeffProbst how long does it usually take to write the books? U seem to be gone a lot filming survivorl #Strandedchat  Ah, okay
#strandedchat if you believe you can do it -- you're halfway there.  Add in the desire TO do it and you're there!
#strandedchat "The adventure you're ready for is the one you get!"  that's always been my guide.  It's no different w kids -
RT @HummieIsMe: #strandedchat @JeffProbst What is the moral of your story -- your main point to get across to children - good question!
#strandedchat If these tweets are bugging you, I understand the temporary unfollow - don't know how to get around it...
RT @jonnyjazzno: Going to unfollow @JeffProbst in 3...2...  Ah... sorry dude.  We're doing a chat today - totally understand.
#strandedchat well Jilly, I haven't  - so far anyway  But I hear you - I crave all kinds of adventure and maybe there is an idea to explore
RT @JillyFitness: @JeffProbst Ok well not just u &amp; me LOL but here's my question, have u thought of writing 4 adults, we need adventure too
#strandedchat have written to say they enjoyed it! Clearly written for kids, but done so in a way that I can see how adults would dig it
RT @Gargamelandpapa: @JeffProbst would adults enjoy stranded? I know it's for kids, but just curious. I've been surprised at how many adults
#strandedchat surprisingly it has not been translated into Spanish even though two of the kids are named DIAZ! :)
RT @rafaellorenzo: @JeffProbst Any plan to translate the book to other languages? It has been translated to a couple so far --
#strandedchat getting to know each other?  The kids find out very quickly that this is a real life or death situation!  They have to bond.
#strandedchat and that's the same idea behind Stranded.  What would happen to four kids who were forced to work together but who were just
#strandedchat probably right.  I LOVE Survivor for that reason.  The social dynamic that plays out in extreme conflict is the appeal
RT @SweetieBirdR: @JeffProbst I'd imagine that years w/ Survivor helped u develop an ear 4 inter-personal conflict? #strandedchat  You're...
RT @johnlogans: @JeffProbst When are we going to see a book by you on all the Survivor shows that have been on? That one is less likely :)
RT @WantDDUBLovin: @JeffProbst Will you do a book signing tour?  #strandedchat  We have discussed something like that --
#strandedchat What if kids get inspired to live a more adventurous life?  Could be really cool!  So that's what I think when it gets tough
#strandedchat I look at it this way - what's the worst that happens?  The books stink.  Okay, big deal.  But what if... people like them?
#strandedchat but if you know your characters and you have good situations it can be a pretty fun process to work through --
#strandedchat I have a good teacher in Chris - but I must say I've enjoyed it a lot.  yes it's always hard to craft a good, tight story -
RT @ElawReads: @JeffProbst People tell me -much harder to write a kids book than they thought. U have that experience? #Strandedchat Well..
#strandedchat so glad she liked the books!  the first of the next trilogy comes out in Sept. along with a new season of Survivor of course!
RT @Gianasmom29: @JeffProbst my 10 yo LOVED all 3 books.  When you will have more books coming out?  Vanessa was her favorite character.  Hi
#strandedchat  the second trilogy is even bigger adventure!  We're really getting to know the "kids" and push them  past their comfort zone
#strandedchat trilogy we will investigate that idea.  I wanted to get enough "story" first to see where we could take the characters.
RT @Ikia_Walker: @JeffProbst #StrandedChat Any chances of a movie based off the books??  I would love to do a movie.  I think after the next
#strandedchat The blended family aspect also plays a part.  It's becoming so common for kids to have "step siblings" - so that's part of it
#strandedchat So that's what we tried to bring to the book.  Real adventure that real kids will really enjoy!
#strandedchat one of the greatest things about Survivor is how many kids I get to talk to - their enthusiasm for adventure is infectious!
#strandedchat with the writing!  I ask them questions, they give me suggestions.  I feel like I have a whole team of co-writers!
RT @bookgeek2872: @JeffProbst Favorite part of writing the books? #StrandedChat I've met so many kids in the last year that have helped...
#strandedchat The goal from the beginning was to make it as real as possible.  The kids in the book are definitely in over their head -
#strandedchat for Stranded came directly from Survivor.  The kids have to make fire, build shelter, catch fish, bugs, scary animals, rain
RT @barrman: @JeffProbst did you get the idea for doing these books from your survivor experience? #Strandedchat Yes, many of the ideas...
#strandedchat I write it with a great writer Chris Tebbetts -- it's been a lot of fun.
#strandedchat The first trilogy - all available now - was a NY Times best seller.  Kids seem to really enjoy it.  So we're writing...
#strandedchat And decided to base it on Survivor.  Four kids get shipwrecked with no adults and have to survive --
#strandedchat my wife and i went looking for books about blended families and realized there weren't any!  So we decided to write one!
RT @WantDDUBLovin: @JeffProbst #StrandedChat  What made you decide to write a kids book? Becoming a dad was the first inspiration...

@TheSouthernDale hmmm... good authority eh?
@StephLevy9 nope
@JulieNshit what up!
#survivor the increase in blindsides is due to smarter players.  You saw with J'Tia what happens if you tell someone.  You can't risk it.
#survivor we r always looking for people :) - if u want it bad enough you'll find a way...   Survivor requires a ton of real desire.
Ah yes the spa reward.... so good!
#survivor When I said 2 more seasons, I meant we'll be shooting 2 more this summer! Not "only" 2 more. U keep watching we keep making 'em!

RT @JasonErhardt: @JeffProbst whats with giving the contestants so much stuff to start w? Are you nuts?  You go live like that for 24 hours.
#survivor Look at that - Morgan can LIE.  Looks open doors, doors lead to experience, experience helps you mature.  She's young but savvy.
RT @Janellebb6fan: @JeffProbst What the heck Jeff? A family night and he gets a buff and I dont? I know... it's so wrong. :)
RT @michellee91xo: @JeffProbst yessss!!  So glad my favourite Wednesday night show is back. Let the games begin. How bout a BUFF!!!

#survivor  Score!  Game on!   Okay next buff opportunity, what was the first season we had a hidden immunity idol?
#survivor And then there was Morgan... what WILL she do....?  Hmm...
RT @ana_marie_FL: @JeffProbst trish BUFF WINNER!! congrats!
RT @Bengerman__: @JeffProbst why is garret not in braun jeff Because his life focus is high stakes poker - strategy - i.e. brains
#survivor If only Garret had time to work out.
#survivor  what would you do?  Which would you choose?
#survivor  Another huge decision coming... and the first "who said it" will pay off!
RT @eemmmmaa99: @JeffProbst i would probably scream if you responded, but i love you so much! AHHHHHGGGGHHHHH!
#survivor  HUGE surprise decision.  Never saw that one coming.
RT @ADiebus: @JeffProbst how scary was it standing on that massive rock? Great safety team and killer helicopter -- all fun!
RT @mychaelwithay: @JeffProbst will you ever wear a different color other than blue? #SURVIVOR NEVER!
RT @bonpage: @JeffProbst how did you get up on the spire? Helicopter and a great safety team.
@meegghhan done. :)
#survivor  and now the game really begins... first big choice for each tribe.

Survivor finale is Sunday Dec. 15th - coming up fast!
@Taylor_84 SCREAM!
Rule clarification: Deadlocked ties - we draw rocks. That's why we rarely have them. Takes a lot of guts. But at final 4 we make fire.
Glad you dug Survivor last night!  Historic!  This group is playing very aggressively - playing to win - that's how you do it!
Hey guys!  Hope you all have a great Thanksgiving!  If you're not with family, I hope you're with friends.

#survivor And just like that we lose two people tonight.  But Redemption offers a 2nd shot to get back in the game.
#survivor Here we go.  Tribal #2.  Please make your votes clear and legible.  Hold them steady so I can read them.

@TaylorKenjii get back to your homework!
#survivor  consensus is that it's either Monica or Tina.... someone about to head to RI to face Aras and Vytas...
#survivor Okay who is going home now?
RT @tycip: @JeffProbst CLAY WINNER!  send your info to @ld425
#survivor okay question to win a hat - Who was the runner up in Survivor Thailand?
#survivor  I love it when people chase each other through the jungle  and love that Tyson is pretending to look for it.  Great stuff!
#survivor if you won a hat you can send your information to @ld425 - but just know she has the list so "pretending" won't work!

@nebulalawrence Fantastic!  Nobody voting you guys off the island!
@anyonesays I'll send it on!
@jorkelley sending it on - only issue I can see is both of you being so young -- but you clearly have an amazing bond.  Very inspiring.

@MarkJohnCarey sent it onto casting!

@Marla_Mc Fair critique.  I'll back it off.
If you think you and your loved one would be great together on Survivor - post it on Youtube and tweet me - I'll make sure casting sees it.
If you were going to play #Survivor...w/ a loved one...who would u bring? It's an instantalliance!
@BarefootBoc Love it!

@lilacangel99 I've changed my ways!
RT @JoeAIzzo: "Do you belong out here?" @JeffProbst. Wow. Little attacking??  Felt fair to me.  Weren't you kind of wondering same thing?
@G_Tern That's funny.  Love that you think I have a lot of make up on.
@miketvladue sibling rivalry - interesting idea.  Can I take credit for it?
@LoveWinsDude yeah it started as two person duels - so we kept the language even when three people.
@tiklemepink go for it... I"m here... let me have it.  I can take it and you need to give it.
@dlatsch so you're gonna stay on the couch?
@Swenny23 Oh I so wanna... but I'm buff-less... literally buff less... hope a "how ya doing" will suffice for now!
@James_Heimann you are acknowledged!
@Sambob25 ha, okay.  point taken.  not sure about stopping at the merge though.  Feels like you need it at the end too.  Just my two cents.
Love catching up on all the comments about B v W and seeing how many people are applying for next year!  Tomorrow is another good one!
@NGDimagiba Ah sorry bout that.  I tend to do that - mess names up - esp in foreign countries.
@jadsmiles appreciate you sticking in there and glad it's paying off.
@AlexProvini 18 is the youngest we've ever had. :)
@ravenkudas http://t.co/WhFR8khLIG - worth a view.

#survivor okay one more buff giveaway -- this is from @JohnMCochran what player ran out of matches in Cook Islands?
#survivor and with that we are wrapped with our first episode of Survivor: Blood vs Water
#survivor @JohnMCochran just arrived!  He held his hug with @parvatishallow for a long time.  Much longer than his high 5 to @MalcolmWHW
#survivor This is a sign of how this season goes.  Blood vs Water will play out in many different ways.
if you're on west coast I'm guessing there is about to be a big spoiler so walk away from your twitter!
#survivor and here we go... first vote out...
@JohnMCochran racing to get here before the vote! It's like a movie.IImagine that pale skin, ginger hair racing thru the CBS lot to get here
@KnowlesCarter_ #survivor Ah thank you!
#survivor yet another twist - vote someone out and they compete against your loved one.  Tricky tricky game.
#survivor -this is the kind of emotion you will see all season long.  It's real.  It's hard.  It's Blood vs Water!
@parvatishallow  says you are so hungry you can feel the back of your stomach

@kayleighs_mom08 HI to your daughter!  I love the theme too!
#survivor so sorry for the occasional spoiler.  I'm trying.  Hard to talk about the show and not give anything away. :)
#survivor @parvatishallow would vote out Rachel, @MalcolmWHW would vote out Katie.
#survivor so fun to hear @parvatishallow and @MalcolmWHW talk about who they would vote out?
RT @linams410: @JeffProbst Eliza NICE!  buff coming!
#survivor buff giveaway who said it - "It's just a F-ing" stick" from a past season?

#survivor ah if only you could all be here - what a party it would be.  The interactive living room is hot tonight.
#survivor tribal council.... somebody will be joining candice and rupert... this should be fun.
@JohnMCochran can't get here - stuck in a writers meeting.  He literally is a writer on The Millers.  Crazy things happen when you say yes.
Correct. Most days total on #Survivor was @bostonrob You get a BUFF!  RT @nealrap @JeffProbst rob?

#survivor @MalcolmWHW is wearing a gray tshirt, jeans, flip-flops - same as me.  But he's still better looking.
#survivor in case you're wondering @parvatishallow is wearing a short dress and 5 inch high heels.
#survivor as the season progresses there are many other layers coming...
#survivor the first layer of the new game - when you win, your loved one loses --
#survivor okay another buff giveaway - Who has played the most days total in Survivor?
#survivor and just like in life the moms show why they are moms... kicking their daughters ass
#survivor bragging rights right here.
#survivor now comes the show down mothers vs daughters
RT @WackoMedia: @JeffProbst I think your commentary may hurt more! #survivor But it's so fun to talk trash!
#survivor If Aras wasn't there Gervase would still be in the water
#survivor oh man that had to hurt!
#survivor Gervase is getting his ass kicked in the water!

#survivor It didn't go unnoticed that CBS invited 2 of the most attractive former players back 2 tweet with me. @MalcolmWHW @parvatishallow
#survivor It appears Colton would be the odds on favorite for #1 villain.  I'm guessing he'll enjoy that ranking.
#survivor Day Zero was to fool them into thinking they would be playing as a "couple"  I think it worked.
#survivor Huge rivalry with Aras and his brother - golden child vs the dark horse... going to be interesting...
#survivor  And... how many people are surprised that Tyson even has a girlfriend?

@keithghill I don't think you need worry about that....
It's cool that some of you are unsure about B v W.  Hope U have faith in our storytelling instincts and give it a shot!  U might just like!
@jenmenwolfe Ah but you might miss something really great!
Countdown is on... 2 wks from tomorrow... 90 minute premiere of Survivor: Blood v Water.  Family members add a game changing dynamic!
@rc_survivor You were missed.
@daveysnewtweet nope that's fine
@kqueen123 that side of you. You're very gentle and reserved.  We'd need to see the other side of you - hope that helps.
@kqueen123 rather than what you'll draw on for strength.  I'd go outside, just walk and talk about game situations, etc so we can see
@kqueen123 Yours is a very touching, tragic story.  Thank you for sharing.  Survivor is an odd beast - we look for how you'll play...
@mla100psu apply as often as you want !
@seanster1 We even offered him a regular spot on The Talk and he still said no.
@shawnbrabbit Yes we will.  :)
@nkyphotographer I loved Troyzan.
Survivor fans -- casting will open up again soon.  I' d say September or October.
@garrettcelestin I sent it off to Lynne.  If you're like that in person you'd be great.  But you have to get through Lynne first!
@emilyclemente September 18th -
@jrhane Very different.  Hey you like RI or you don't.  I get it.  But they're very different.
@jamestown_94w Ah but then you'll miss out on the moment if and when it comes!
@brandon_p32 It's all part of the plan to keep the show interesting - I do believe you'll enjoy Blood v Water if you give it a chance.
@kelsihatheway Thanks.  Loved this show.  Bummer it's over.
@eliz_farbota_xo Too late for that.
@wrightio96 You're nuts.
@truedorktimes God no!
@erdy17 excellent!  Be yourself, don't hold back.  Don't try to answer correctly.  Just speak your truth.  Hope it goes well!
Thank u @daltonross for the link --   http://t.co/7dTDWiCR3p  --there is no mention of RI not coming back.  Plus, saved myself 40 pesos.
RT @unheardwords: @JeffProbst http://t.co/4lVt2JjHQW This is where people are getting it from I need the link...40 pesos to hear me say it.
40 filliipino pesos for anyone who can get me the link where I say RI is not coming back.  That's right 40 pesos!
@shevekm funny idea
@ruedog3 I think we jumped the shark back in season 3 when we "switched tribe members" and fans lost their minds.
@katjamb Sorry we didn't meet but thanks for the support.
@truedorktimes It's a love hate for sure.  But fascinating.  Always fascinating.
@torontotom02 Dude, I understand.  We'll miss you.
@unheardwords Would someone please send me the interview where I said that....
@evan71788 What up Evan!
@adrian_9221 Ah Adrian and things were going so well between us.  See ya.
@anomybc ah if only it were legal to take bets :)  Hope you check it out. If not we'll miss you.
@thegrimrecapper Why you wanna fire me?
@dianndroid I do hear you on Colton.  Might be worth watching to see how it plays out.  But respect your decision either way.
@schmid3 Bummer, we'll miss you.  But I get it, you have to have your boundaries.
@JeffProbst Rupert Again? isn't his 15 minutes up already?   Evidently he got a groupon for another go.
One of the biggest differences -the added layers of game play due to loved ones being on opposite tribe.  Pretty interesting.  Emotional.
@khostile Ah, but you're making a big assumption that Blood v Water will divide love rather than strengthen the bond.
@1matt210 I get it.  Okay we'll miss you.
@kelinsc This summer!
@mr_survivor_  Ah bummer.  I understand.  We'll miss you.  At least you have Amazing Race.
Survivor: Blood v Water premieres with 90 min episode one on September 18th!
@dnsyl57 so surprised you didn't like last season.  Definitely one of my favorites.
@todd_garner what up!!
Ah, I've so missed twitter.  I say this to you guys every season -u have to trust.  We always make the show for u. Blood v Water is great.
@kqueen123 exactly.
@jamieeles Jamie, just heard from CBS.  They would love for you to come host the reunion show!  I'll stay out the way, do your thing brotha!
@elecguru Ah you'd be missing out on something good...
Hey Survivor fans!  Cast announcement today for Blood v. Water.  I think you will be surprised and pleased with how it all plays out!
@marymo6 I hope you get it!  Would love to snuff your torch.
@giannasereni hello.... but no need to die just yet....
