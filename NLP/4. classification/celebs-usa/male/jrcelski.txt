@Delta Flight 1812 DTW - SEA, hands down worst flight I've been on. Very rude flight attendants. Disappointed as a long time customer.
On another note, hopped off the plane in NY and found myself standing next to Shake Shack. Lord have mercy.
And lives for that matter.
Short Track is too precious of a sport to fall victim to tainted individuals and teams that cheat others out of their energy.
On that note, if you're not going to compete clean, don't do it at all. People sacrifice everything to chase their dreams of making it.
Kind of amusing to me how many people act surprised by RU athletes getting popped. A huge letdown, but the community was suspect for years.

The Olympics are finished. Considering a career in golf. Anyone want to coach me onto the @PGATOUR?
Until next time, Sochi! Thankfully I packed a few @uncrustables Sandwiches for my flight home #havefunwithit #sochi2014
Rise and grind. So many great memories, but there's always more to keep working toward. #sochi2014 #risingshining
So many great moments at #sochi2014 - serious to ridiculous - this team knows how to #havefunwithit
I didn’t get to Sochi all by myself, I’ve had #TeamUSA behind me the whole way. Pic by @LibertyMutual. #RISE #sp http://t.co/rqE5n97e5K
@noellepikuspace @TDAmeritrade thanks for stopping by!
Congrats on GOLD @Meryl_Davis and @CharlieaWhite! Way to kill it out there and bring one home for the US.

I'm grateful for those of you who continue to walk with me and inspire me with your positive energy. Much love to you all.
I've learned that every day is a new day to challenge myself to be better, but also to remember appreciating who and what I already have.
I will be racing the 500 meter and relay later this week. I'm staying positive and focused. Still smiling too :)
For those who were wondering, I hit a block last night (probaly the second time I've done that in 4 years) and banged my knees up a little.
Believe in yourself. #beunstoppable #sochi2014 #teamcelski #teamUSA
Cool to see Victor An win gold today. A lot of respect for that guy and his efforts in the sport. #worldclass
Thanks for all of the continued support. Today didn't go too well but I am looking forward to competing again next week! #TeamUSA
Every day. No matter what. We bring it.  #TeamUSA #HaveFunWithIt #sochi2014
I have so much love for all the people who support me and send positive energy in my direction. It will be returned. Thank you! #TeamCelski

@cmac605 @TDAmeritrade I sharpen usually before every practice and I use 2 diamond stones / 1 polishing stone. #itaddsup
@ItsNotJerrmy I love the sport and don't feel like I can stop until I'm satisfied with what I've done on the ice! So (probably). #itaddsup
.@Stempky They challenge me to try my hardest even when I don't feel good. Tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it. #itaddsup
.@gousaorgohome @TDAmeritrade I'd have to give myself a generous 5/10. #itaddsup
@pizzalogger @TDAmeritrade I first dreamt of going to the Olympics when I was 12 years old. #itaddsup

.@ifyousayso_anna @TDAmeritrade I take some time off and rest. Resting is just as important as training. #itaddsup
@followbeno Great question! The water makes the ice a little softer and fills in the ruts to make it more grippy for our blades. #itaddsup
.@ceejeon @TDAmeritrade Imagine taking a breath of fresh air for the first time after being inside for a month. Kinda like that. #itaddsup

I'm excited to announce my partnership with @wheaties; The Breakfast of Champions https://t.co/wSMwZ1PbMb #TeamWheaties
@B_Zhao My favorite person to race is Kwak Yoon-gy
@Britishluke Sorry to hear that, keep your head up and carry a positive attitude!
@Schmangela1 I always wanted to be a soccer player! Favorite besides skating is golf.
@ElomanisaG Knowing that I'm carrying my country on my back! Such an honor to represent where I come from to the rest of the world.
@ElomanisaG I got you! What do you want to know?
@itsMElizabeth Hopefully still doing what I love to do!
@skiwhino Thank you for the support!
I also have some exciting news to announce tomorrow regarding my support team. #Sochi2014
Thanks for all the great questions! I will do this more and more leading up to #Sochi2014. Stay tuned.
@_ja5mine Pushing through any workout and giving it my full effort is something that I strive to do every time. This helps me stay strong.
@CDCPareja Time around my loved ones.
@MorganSpangler It was... wanted it to be easier for people to find me!
@BrendaMilberry Thank you!!
@CDCPareja I love listening to hip hop... mostly old school stuff (A tribe called quest, the roots etc..)
@jamielynettec I'm so excited to be given this opportunity to compete again. So much fun training for the Olympics!
@boxofminhtz Definitely my bed and a nice dinner
@DavidSpearman I think back to all the times I got beat or didn't achieve my goals and use those situations to fuel my fire.
@justinecashew Happy Birthday!!
@mandalovpanda Definitely more focused and more knowledgeable than I was before! Using all my energy in the right way.
@Britishluke In my lowest point I turned to God and my family/friends to help me through. The only thing I could do.
@Britishluke I tried to keep the most positive attitude about my situation when I was in it. This helped me overcome the doubt in my mind.
@__aycee I appreciate that!!
@plewbergoober Chance the Rapper - Acidrap (album)
@kristengibson I've done it before but don't do it regularly as part of my training reg.
@alexiahhhh I love me some chocolate peanut butter cup ice cream
@edmonds_riley I'm focused on all the distances this year... Not one in particular. Gotta keep myself well rounded!
@melodyz816 As of now I don't have too much time to fit school in.. Definitely in my plans in the future though!
@MrLittleAsian A lot of endurance running/biking and weights training.
@adamchiasson (acclimatization). I skate on 17.5 inch maples
@adamchiasson High altitude training helps by limiting oxygen to the lungs in turn helping you grow a greater capacity to exercise
@thruallyzeyez Tapering usually happens a week or two before comp. Let the body rest a little more than usual.
@thruallyzeyez I train 2 hours on the ice every day. After that I have a run/hill climb etc. type of workout. and weights in the pm!
@punkawonk I listen to a lot of music, and love to watch documentaries on netflix
@kathybeatz I always remind myself why I am doing it in the first place before I start. This helps me push through the hard work!
@justinecashew I haven't been on anything too new recently. A lot of hip hop.. Chance the Rapper is my new fav.
@BrendaMilberry As of right now I am training in Long Beach, CA but will be training full in time in SLC starting in July. Sochi is in Feb!
@__aycee When I want some active recovery I go out on the golf course and walk 9 or 18 holes if I'm feeling up to it.
@sincerely_steff A lot more dedication to my training and diet... It's important to stay balanced. Not doing anything TOO different though.
@trixienation I'm focusing on myself and trying to create a positive training environment for the people that surround me!
@Mariaaanish I love me some lara bars (peanut butter cookie) and trader joe's trail mix
@PeRuRaO95 I appreciate that a lot!!! Thank you.
@karinadollface But I try to stay as balanced as possible. Moderation is key in training.
@karinadollface It's very hard to do especially when we're mid training.. I want to eat ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.
@aivlysrodriguez It's going very well! The doctor that stitched me up and the team that helped me rehab did wonders for me.
@alexiahhhh My favorite exercise is intensive interval training. something that lasts around :45 seconds to 1:00.. (hill runs)
@nmowen12 I'm a fan of the 1000 meter and the relay
@kaye_kikay taking it one step at a time!
@coley3354 I make sure to get a bunch of fruits (usually fruit juice), cereal and some greek yogurt before training.
@hllothere depends what you like more! i'd go with pie personally.
I've been working hard in the lead up to Olympic year. If you have a question for me re: Training... ASK ME! Im w/ you for 30. #TrainingTalk

Also, do things to benefit everyone, not just yourself. You will be rewarded in more ways than you can imagine.

@RAscion You're definitely right. They need to fix this ref situation before the players/coaches start boycotting games
I wish we won this game legit, that way Seattle would be praised for the 8 SACKS that will forever be overlooked now...
@nickotto7 Embarrassing win, but oh well.. haha I'm not gonna complain. Wilson is the man though!
Oh wait, not worse than the calls in the Steelers win over Seattle in Superbowl XL though.
Worst call I've ever seen...
