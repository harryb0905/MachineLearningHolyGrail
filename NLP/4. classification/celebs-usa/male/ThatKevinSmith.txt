One year ago today, I had a heart attack! And today is the last day to #GetYourHeartOn! Post a shot of yourself making those heart hands with the #GetYourHeartOn hashtag and @ww_us will donate $1 to @American_Heart for each post shared! https://t.co/dRBugu1ifH
On Monday morning, a 48 year old man will sneak up into the attic and play with all his favorite toys again... #JayAndSilentBobReboot https://t.co/wp2fwG1PHO
Brody was such a nice guy and a stone cold pro. He was so funny that day, I said “*I* should be in the audience and *you* should be sitting on the stage.” He replied “Gimme your hockey jersey and I’ll give you my hairline and we’ll Prince &amp; Pauper it.” Good night, sweet Prince. https://t.co/EKCTOUeyZY
I’m gonna tell @MrMikeCalta how #JayAndSilentBobReboot right NOW! Listen live at @1025TheBone! https://t.co/HtxWTWnSGN
Watch me get Bang’d on your TV set! It’s @WilliamShatner, @kaj33, @JoeManganiello and me playing @Wizards_DnD with @wilw on @bigbangtheory TONIGHT! https://t.co/8P34Z1v6Dq
They sat old-ass, soft boy me next to sexy-ass, cut-from-Gods-own-wood @JoeManganiello. One of these things is *not* like the other. See me and Joltin’ Joe THURSDAY on one of the last new @bigbangtheory eps ever! https://t.co/0HyCVljATb
Wanna wear this amazing @RickandMorty Jay &amp; Silent Bob mashup shirt? @The_SecretStash has you covered! Order it here: https://t.co/HC76xQt3HH https://t.co/wImu2A9QgG
Wanna wear the old jerseys of someone from New Jersey? After dropping the weight, I have a closet full of sweaters that don’t fit anymore - so @JamieWalton is auctioning them off to benefit our charity, @TheWayneFDN! Click the link below! https://t.co/jkIIxgljQR
BABBLE along with me &amp; @RalphGarman when we record a hot, horny home show! https://t.co/RxOEZgv563
My old man worked for the @USPS. When he retired, they gave him this piece of paper. Mom gave it to me so I’m having it framed and hung up at my house. Dad’s job paid for my whole life. So I am the proud child of a government employee. https://t.co/fJSiuRL84Y
Amazing job, @DiscoD_83! Both @TheWayneFDN and I thank you, sir! But even more, I thank you for dropping the lbs with me and @ww_us! Get ready for your closeup! https://t.co/AmH4DgEkCh
I first posted about #JayAndSilentBobReboot on @instagram 2/9/17. It’s been 2 years and 1 week since that post, during which time I almost died. But a week from Monday, we finally start rolling on Reboot. Never give up, Kids. Even when your heart wants to. https://t.co/D2khMMx5iR https://t.co/00zHJ4LVQe
This is how you do it! Hats off to @JordanPeele for highlighting graphic artists in the build up to his freaky feeling @UsMovie! This @juststeven5 piece is fun to study and it makes me even more excited to see this flick! https://t.co/yEEDS343GD
Farewell, Bruno Ganz! My movie Dogma never would’ve even occurred to me without seeing your angelic performance of Damiel in Wings of Desire. Your performance in Downfall was legendary, your vast career was enviable. Rest now, Thespian. https://t.co/jkqxcy69at
My kid &amp; her band The Tenth made their very first music video, directed by fellow @ArcherSchool grad Meghan Marshall. Love that these kids met in middle school and now they’re growing up and making art together! If you have the time, I SAW A GHOST is here: https://t.co/dGxUhiXs1Q https://t.co/c2QFy1HQGY
I’m so sorry for your loss, my friend. Please pass on my condolences to the rest of your family. The cap is from Vulgarthon 2000 and looks like it was signed by me, @BrianCOHalloran, Jeff Anderson, @BrianLynch, @TellEmSteveDave and @JenSchwalbach. Not sure who signed under Jen. https://t.co/Ec2e5GRcWP
Happy Valentines Day to the two ladies who own my heart - @JenSchwalbach &amp; Harley Quinn Smith! Granted, the heart in question is now a famously unreliable, busted bum ticker that was packed with more cream filling than a Twinkie. But at least said cardiac Twinkie is all theirs! https://t.co/RQAGL4yteA
I had so much legit fun being on @DropTheMicTNT! Spitting a hot 16 at @JayMewes put me 8 miles ahead of him! I refuse to miss a chance to diss! Watch us battle below! #DropTheMic https://t.co/S2vU6hCMC8
*I* agree: He did! But He has a name too. Regardless, it was a delight to destroy @JayMewes with my mouth! Thanks for having me on the show! May you be married a thousand years! https://t.co/RnlX8IPgOU
WEST COAST! Watch the rhymes melt in my mouth, not in my hands when we @DropTheMicTNT! Starting right now! https://t.co/4lWPLIM3VW
Watch me atomize @JayMewes using merely my mouth! No, it’s not a sex thing, it’s @DropTheMicTNT! TONIGHT!!! https://t.co/j1Vc4BXqMX
Dear @redbox: I’m making a movie called #JayAndSilentBobReboot and we’ve been trying to get in touch with you so we can feature a Red Box in the flick as the replacement for RST Video. Any interest? We can make a fake version but I figured you folks might enjoy the exposure.
The HIT-GIRL I wrote and @Pernilleoe brought to life with her awesome artwork is in stores TODAY! Thank you to @mrmarkmillar for letting us play with his toys! If you have the loot or the time, stop by your local comic book store or @The_SecretStash and pick one up! https://t.co/wPHWiObT0K
TOMORROW! I will finally fight @JayMewes with @methodman as a witness to the carnage on @DropTheMicTNT! https://t.co/qLlM7WruFj
In a million years I never thought I would ever Tweet these words but here goes... Read about my weight-loss journey in @MensHealthMag! Includes an excellent video in which you see my kitchen, as well as me and my dog working out! #WWAmbassador https://t.co/qt5GzUW4wg

Thank you to @Marvel &amp; @hulu for letting me do fowl things to Howard in animation! But the *real* brains of our operation is a legit cartoon genius - the great Meatwad himself, Aqua Teen Hunger Force’s @DaveWillis2! Prepare to get Ducked hard! https://t.co/ofQDnuHAbo
This is such a great idea! I just donated to @ReelOutreach so they can send kids from @GirlsIncDallas to see @captainmarvel in March! Love this organization! Every kid should be able to enjoy the magic of a movie theater and the magnificence of @MarvelStudios! https://t.co/dhfj6ak5UG
My kid and her band took me back to the 80’s without ever leaving our living room last night with their cover of Modern English’s I Melt With You! The Tenth Band’s new album DUNES is now available at @Spotify, @Bandcamp, @AppleMusic &amp; @iTunes! https://t.co/n5y1sCHCda
Congrats to my kid and her band The Tenth on the release of their album, Dunes! So weird and wonderful to discover this late in life that a musician emerged from my balls! You can hear the album on @Spotify: https://t.co/GubjoKRs1q https://t.co/32vkpGlovS
The first episode of #SModcast was posted way back on February 5th, 2007! So when my bro Scotty Mo and I record this week’s new episode, we’ll be celebrating our 12th anniversary as podcasters! Thanks to everyone who lent us your ears over the years! I’ve loved giving you oral! https://t.co/X5NBihMEbG
Love this piece, @DarkNateReturns! If anyone’s looking for something signed by the dork who plays Silent Bob and also cries during movie trailers, this is an artsy opportunity! https://t.co/T3clJiCaZs
Thank you to the @LAPDHollywood. The kid and I went in and filed another complaint and the officers and detectives were very helpful, courteous and understanding. “Look for the helpers,” as Mr. Rogers said his Mom once told him. “You will always find people who are helping.”
With all due respect, @LAPDHollywood, I did that before Tweet. Got voicemail. But I just called again, went through voicemail menu and left a message. Is there a better, more direct number I can call? Hate to be an alarmist but this out-of-towner is now blocks from where we live. https://t.co/I55zoPc0L8
Dear @LAPDHollywood - This man has stalked my 19 yr old daughter online. She went in to the PD and filed a complaint weeks ago. Today he posted an Instagram video from a corner that’s frighteningly close to where we live: https://t.co/5vLIYJ9Fl1 Spooky stuff. What do we do now? https://t.co/50x9ifvs7r
OXNARD! We gonna talk hard TONIGHT! Come see me &amp; @RalphGarman BABBLE at @LevityOxnard at 9:45!

Sometimes when I read the news or the internet, I feel like kids today missed out on the simple joy I knew growing up in the 80’s. But last night I saw my daughter &amp; her bubblegum punk band cover “I Melt With You.” And for a minute, I was trapped in a state of imaginary grace. https://t.co/4vEsERpJfy

It took me 48 years to finally learn that Tabasco Sauce is not the name of a condiment but the *brand* name of a condiment. It’s like how Band-Aid is the brand name for a bandage. All this time, I thought @TABASCO was like ketchup, mayo, mustard or salsa. Fuck, I’m so ignorant... https://t.co/HhJ5nXJ8Th
Snoogans! Nice job, @DarkNateReturns! https://t.co/fIUUpGRmct
Son of a gun, we’ll have big fun on the Bayou... #JayandSilentBobReboot https://t.co/4WvQMKVev9
Taken by my kid during @TheRealStanLee #Excelsior show last night at the @ChineseTheatres. Many thanks to @LegionMOfficial and @AgentsofMayhem and POW for letting me emcee the event. We sent the Old Man off with a lot of love. https://t.co/XzJK3Kz4Er
This is the Key to the City that the legit geeky @MayorOfLA presented to POW on behalf of @TheRealStanLee at last night’s sensational ceremony at the @ChineseTheatres! They even etched his image into it! https://t.co/fHPvc6FR3Y
What an incredibly special evening! Thank you to everyone who was at the @ChineseTheatres tonight to celebrate The Man! I’m pretty sure @TheRealStanLee was with us too! https://t.co/CHbQS5HNrO

“I’d buy the Quick Stop and reopen it myself!” was the bravest, most rational thing I ever heard one of my fictional characters say. Full disclosure: said characters may not be real, but they do tend to live happily ever after. https://t.co/JxAX9Oyqpo
Then &amp; Now! Hear the brand new SModcast with me and my bro, Scotty Mo at the link below! https://t.co/q3ekyvS0pI
Enjoy this #IMDbStudio clip in which I nervously call @ZacEfron “the most fuckable Ted Bundy on the planet.” See, Kids? Even grown-ass professionals can say goofy shit when they come face-to-face with famous people. https://t.co/9Ydmu5Qqah
This was one of my favorite interviews I’ve ever done for @IMDb. There was an overwhelming amount of love in the #IMDbStudio for @AlfreWoodard - one of my favorite thespians on the planet, ever since I first saw her in Scrooged! Give this clip a watch. https://t.co/cBrIAkAmYZ
You are my Queen! Thank you for the @WonderWomanFilm spoilers - it’ll make the year wait easier! Next time we see each other, we podcast! https://t.co/yFw4qxo47O
Dear @jamieleecurtis - You raised an excellent point on the @IMDb boat this summer! So this is me asking: Will you come play with us on #JayAndSilentBobReboot? It’s a really funny part and we can have you in and out in a day! Help us tell some cinematic true lies, Wanda! https://t.co/WAysWpEZSj
"There is nothing wrong with your television. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are now in control of the transmission." Thank you to the @Elreynetwork for letting us take over the channel for 24 hours! Do we get to keep the money from the commercials? https://t.co/xp4WlnJeGG
I wasn’t done with the hockey jerseys, @JoeQuesada - the hockey jerseys were done with me. But we still text each other on rainy days or whenever we’re feeling sentimental. One night we tried a hockey jersey booty call. But it just wasn’t the same anymore. We’d both changed. https://t.co/taA2mK3ByO
Yes, @billmaher took a shot at me during his show last night, in the midst of his latest rant about @TheRealStanLee and adults who like comic books. No, I’m not mad at all. Bill may talk tough but he’s a stoner like me and a real pussycat when confronted: https://t.co/LRNdNeI2vr https://t.co/VEf3fYi3b4
SNOOGANS! To celebrate my 25th anniversary at Sundance, I’m pleased as a pot-head to announce that the good folks at SABAN and UNIVERSAL have given the green light to #JayAndSilentBobReboot! @JayMewes and I start shooting on 2/25 (the one year anniversary of my heart attack)! https://t.co/fFTO9AFZbk
At @sundancefest 2019 on behalf of @IMDb for Day 1 of 4 in which I interview my cinematic betters! First visited Park City 25 years ago with Clerks - so even though I’m a grownup I’ve now been a Sundance Kid for a quarter century. https://t.co/nq7DxY1N82
Sure! That’d be fun! Can we do it first week of February? https://t.co/qYB5VBMuNA
Reenacting the infamous Crime Alley Wayne murders with the kids from @TheGoldbergsABC! The Gold-Bats? The Bat-Bergs? Read about it here: https://t.co/IiRR3ra8IS https://t.co/WoDjyNwbCH
But I didn’t retweet hate. The only thing I retweeted was *your* tweet: https://t.co/ezoa4zBSLj And mind you, I only had to retweet it in the first place to correct the misleading phrasing that asserted these were somehow “Kevin Smith Tickets.” https://t.co/fVMW8q2q7Q
Um... if you mean @TheRealStanLee tribute show at the @ChineseTheatres, that’s not *my* show - it’s a show organized by POW and other Stan fans at which I am the unpaid, voluntary emcee. All net proceeds are going to @heroinitiative - a charity Stan loved. https://t.co/EV3mPzqYeG https://t.co/28uWrGHFKq
Join us on 1/30 at the @ChineseTheatres as we gather in his name, tell tales and sing songs about our beloved Pope of Pop, @TheRealStanLee! Only a few tickets left at https://t.co/rYJQ1Ay1fL! (All net proceeds to benefit one of Stan’s favorite charities, the @heroinitiative!) https://t.co/3iuUSRG8Rr
My first film is now older than I was when I made it. That means I’ve been working in entertainment longer than when I was just simply dreaming about being in show business. I offer so many thanks to anyone who ever sampled my stuff. Your support saved me from getting a real job! https://t.co/Npx4dk9s3O
25 years ago today, CLERKS made its @sundancefest debut! It's been a quarter century since my life was changed in a weekend, and I wasn't even supposed to be there that day! So @IMDb did a look back at my career for their Directors's Trademarks series: https://t.co/X2fs2FkW1x https://t.co/f3t2TlCNe7
G’morning! The HIT-GIRL mini-series I wrote when I was recovering from my heart attack comes out in February, and @Pernilleoe absolutely crushed the interiors! Many thanks to @HannaFlint and @Dazed for letting me gab about it! https://t.co/QOlfNjgQbD

Had a blast bringing BABBLE to @standuplive with @RalphGarman! To whatever artist made this sweet TK-420 Stormtrooper Helmet: I couldn’t get it on the plane so I signed it and left it behind for you instead. They’re holding it for you at Standup Live. Thanks for thinking of me! https://t.co/7J38FZSZHV

He told me before we started recording but swore my big mouth to secrecy. I think @JasonReitman said that the morning after we recorded the podcast, he was shooting that sweet teaser. I hinted at him doing something big next up by show’s end. Hear it here: https://t.co/UtdCREXd3W https://t.co/Gu7sRJLbgm
Harley is in a terrific new flick with @MollyRingwald that comes out TODAY, entitled ALL THESE SMALL MOMENTS!

That Moment When You Nut Because a Thing You Never Imagined Happening in Your Lifetime Suddenly Happens Before Your Eyes. @SpiderManMovie looks amazing but inclusion of Brokeback Mysterio is proof we live in a golden age of wonder! Happy to be alive to see ol’ Fish-Bowl fly! https://t.co/uVdSHKzOrI

Spent the morning brunching with @wendimclendonco and her Frentas while I get undeserved credit for “directing” my 3rd episode of @TheGoldbergsABC! I was about to direct my 3rd ep back in February of last year but I had a heart attack instead. So far, that hasn’t happened again. https://t.co/P6MJIvhy5Y

Pitched it to @netflix two years ago. They did not feel the same way you do. Neither did @hulu or @Showtime. I’m hoping #JayAndSilentBobReboot changes that. https://t.co/8EVxh0r1in
Get some mind-blowing oral from me, @JoeQuesada, @jpalmiotti and more as we tell the tale of twenty years ago when the @Marvel Knights were born! https://t.co/izQNkKWCLm
20 years ago. I still have some of these photos framed on my walls at home. Did you notice @TellEmSteveDave making a cameo in @The_SecretStash? https://t.co/LLj0DtVrwl
I *love* @LetterkennyProb. One of my only regrets of 2018 was that I almost got to cameo on the show... until my stupid heart started acting like an asshole. Fingers crossed I get called back next season! #PitterPatter https://t.co/tq1ZoogYUj
This manifesto brought to you by #JayAndSilentBob! J&amp;SBSB has returned to @netflix! It’s exactly like #BirdBox but without all the blindfolds! https://t.co/A8G1tX56zj https://t.co/0wvpPHmNcM

Spent the first day of 2019 having a #JayAndSilentBobReboot pre-pre-production meeting at our holiday-roomy @WeWork office! @JayMewes took this pic of me and @JordanMonsanto to both mark the moment and to document that we were the only dopes in Hollywood working on the holiday. https://t.co/xTNrpN6OF6
HAPPY NEW YEAR! May you accomplish all the things you dream of doing (unless you dream of hurting people)! 2018 was the year that almost killed me, but 2019 will be the year of the REBOOT! https://t.co/IRlRcgmArY
I met you fine folks during my travels throughout the course of 2018 and either you didn’t have a camera or your job prohibited you from asking for a pic. So I asked YOU instead. Thank you for making me feel like I still matter! Sorry it took a minute but your photos are ready! https://t.co/F9Vxa0jtb8
Watch me get wet over the @aquamanmovie on a brand new #FatManBeyond! https://t.co/ZDLBhbrqKo

Runyon @TeePublic Shirt 5 (from yesterday’s hike) is an ode to the flick that made me fall in love with movies: JAWS!

I end 2018 over 50 pounds lighter than when I started it, thanks in no small part to @WW! #WW is #ForEveryBody. Read about my forthcoming WW podcasts here: https://t.co/7WZJb2DaTm #WWAmbassador Technically, this is an #ad. But I’m also just a big fan who is now not as big! https://t.co/wzMagPBZ3Z
Today, @TheRealStanLee would have been 96. I shot this clip of my friend and hero last year at his 95th birthday. Read all about it here: https://t.co/rPGBuxXaOX https://t.co/PAE9Kiir3E
Come end this wretched year with me and Baby New Year himself, @RalphGarman! Choose either the 7:30 or 10pm shows and start 2019 with a bit of BABBLE! For tix: https://t.co/Q3kJxcT5Rz https://t.co/VaoOnYWknx
For my @TeePublic Runyon Shirt 4, I chose one with @TheCWSupergirl (by TomTrager)! Is it weird to wear an image of someone you actually know? I’ve had @JayMewes on my shirts for years, so sporting @MelissaBenoist is a welcome change. I even got a few thumbs-ups for the shirt. https://t.co/910AUa4A68
The @ANationMovie is one of those visionary flicks that's so next level, I feel embarrassed to also call myself a filmmaker. Same with that piece of perfection @eighthgrademov: fuck, it was insanely well-observed, shot and acted! If I started my career today I'd have no chance...
Not only will I clean the closet, I'm gonna sell all my old game-worn sweaters to benefit for @TheWayneFDN! I'll do a live stream of the sea of jerseys signing tomorrow and you can start selling next month! https://t.co/VIJhxp4IzD
After a 1 day break for Christmas indulgence, the hikes begin anew! Today’s @TeePublic Runyon Shirt (3 of 30) features comedy icon John Candy in his classic BLUES BROTHERS cameo. John Belushi and John Candy were two of my heavy-set heavyweight comedy gods. Wish I got to meet ‘em. https://t.co/2lxSjgnVgr
Thank U @JordanPeele! I loved your unsettling @UsMovie trailer but I’ll try to get rid of the scissors before my doppelgänger finds them! You have not only my admiration but also at least 20 of my bucks whenever one of your flicks hits theaters! Also: I got @KevinHart4real’s box. https://t.co/55Mch0B6Oc
Christmas was made more @Marvel-ous when @JenSchwalbach gave me this amazing, sensational Spider-Man lithograph from @TheShagStorePS. It’s made all the more special with the inclusion of a certain celebrity watching the Sinister Six from a nearby skyscraper: @TheRealStanLee! https://t.co/N8OwjmpeRH
Merry Christmas, @Matt_Westphalen! This looks like my dream bedroom - the one I’d have if my wife let me. https://t.co/i3nhZUXDyY
So weird: my wife gave me the exact same pillow with you and me on it! Merry Christmas, @tedwells! https://t.co/YWzJeeSW3S
I thank you for making me &amp; my @comedydynamics standup special part of your Holiday! https://t.co/6ah6jSbjEQ

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from Jingle Jay, Silent Night Bob and their festive families! If you want, you can read my Christmas missive about SCROOGED here: https://t.co/N1UpYxiGe4 https://t.co/muwiGOugmm
Runyon Shirt 2 of 30! Shecky does her best impression of Leia in the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK poster while I showcase a @TeePublic design by DrewID entitled “The Mysterious Puppeteer.” Mysterio is my favorite @Marvel villain (and the bad guy from the Daredevil run I wrote 20 yrs ago)! https://t.co/GsqDBM2xsC
Listen as @marcbernardin and I do a 2 hour, spoiler-filled #FatManBeyond about Into the @SpiderVerse! We don’t review the animated flick so much as re-live it minute by minute! https://t.co/4EiWdpy6wb
Hiking Runyon with my canine companion, wearing an old school 1989 Tim Burton Batman tee from @TeePublic! I bought 30 new t-shirts as motivation to do this hike as many times and showcase a new shirt each day before I leave for #JayAndSilentBobReboot next month! This is Shirt 1! https://t.co/eLoQatLFFe
Watch me try to be dry and witty as I caption some @NewYorker cartoons in the #NewYorkerCaptionContest! https://t.co/28bgeP7dZx https://t.co/hBaBIvAGrC
What a weird, wonderful year! Hosted for @IMDb. Made my 3rd @CW_TheFlash. Shot a @comedydynamics special for @Showtime. Almost died. Lost 50 lbs. Became a @ww_us ambassador. Wrote for @Disney. Directed my 4th @TheCWSupergirl. Still above ground. In 2019: #JayAndSilentBobReboot!
First there is a mountain. Then there is no mountain. Then there is. Cannot believe #DCUDoomPatrol is actually happening! Congrats to @TheDCUniverse! Can’t wait to watch it! https://t.co/maQmsrTGEF

Farewell to the lady I imitated as a kid before becoming her neighbor years later, legendary sitcom star and BIG director Penny Marshall.

I know the internet has been used by unscrupulous people for sinister purposes, but without the web, you’d never get snapshots of other people’s lives that are as powerful and beautiful as this. May your Christmas be as Merry and your Holidays be as happy as this little guy’s. https://t.co/23fG55E361
Raise your hands if you’re going to @TheEmeraldCup today! If we said we weren’t excited about this, weed be lying! Come see me and @JayMewes record our podcast Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old at 3 today! #JayAndSilentBobAtTheEmeraldCup https://t.co/FsxChZ0S9n
When @SpiderVerse opened with a Comics Code Authority seal, I shot my own webs! It’s a passionate love letter to the medium, packed with expert animation, an emotionally rooted plot &amp; characters that feel more real than most non-cartoon movies! Below, I talk Spidey with @WIRED... https://t.co/HSSQ1xuUZZ
It’s 10am in Utah and I’m about to dive into the @SpiderVerse. This is what movies are for: temporary escape... https://t.co/aeoRfe0xgG
Left my Mom’s hospital bedside at 2:30am. She had a rough night. Got on a plane to Utah at 7. Landed to learn that Mom was emergency helicoptered to another hospital where they drained a liter of fluid from around her heart. Fuck Father Time for beating up my Mom. Stupid asshole. https://t.co/lvGe9ZSdHy
UTAH! Come study the Book of Garman with me &amp; @RalphGarman when we BABBLE at @WiseguysSLC TONIGHT! Grab your tickets here: https://t.co/xjwZGxibyz (Awesome art by @DarkNateReturns!) https://t.co/7xh9CxUsr2
I have a couple thousand unloved copies of @YogaHosers so I’m happy to send you a copy for your birthday! DM @JordanMonsanto your address and we’ll get it out to you next week! Wunderbar Berfday wishes from the hopeless dreamer in the Bratzi suit! https://t.co/qFRXhbjEDg
On a brand new SMODCAST! @JasonReitman and I talk about making a movie with @RealHughJackman! To be clear, Jason made the movie with Hugh, not me. I just watched, like a dirty little cuck! https://t.co/MgUGFY5p5W
Revisit the year in movies with the @IMDb Top Movies of 2018 - with your host, Silent Dork! https://t.co/iD090HluTM
These are the fine folks who feed me everyday at @VeggieGrill! They are all that stands between my starvation or satiety! To give it pop cultural context, if my daily trip to #VeggieGrill was the TV show CHEERS, they’d be Sam and Woody (and I would be Norm). https://t.co/nwEQU1M4Va
SALT LAKE CITY! Come see me &amp; @RalphGarman BABBLE at each other on THURSDAY night at @WiseguysSLC! https://t.co/s1VJH46dcB

Let @The_SecretStash help you find the perfect Christmas gift for that last Kevin Smith fan in your life! https://t.co/kQqwGMqVCe
The number will shock and alarm you. Someone add it to the bio on my @IMDb page as you check out this latest episode of the #IMDbShow! https://t.co/uUKUfmygno
Just saw #IceboxHBO. Such a powerful film that made me appreciate the freedoms I take for granted every day. @AnthonyBGonzal deserves every award imaginable. @HBO announced it’s donating $10 to #immigrantrights charities for every use of the #ICEBOXcares hashtag. So please RT. https://t.co/qDZqkCmDM2

The @MarvelStudios logo gets Snapped! The Thanos scarecrow! Ronin reveal! And @AntMan is gonna play a big role! @Avengers, I promise to stay alive until your tale is told!

I was on #GMADAY today to talk about my @comedydynamics standup special SILENT BUT DEADLY, but my inner Fan-Girl slipped out and I gushed about @starwars a little as well... https://t.co/6Lu84an0Os
TUNE-IN ALERT! Watch me talk about my @comedydynamics standup special SILENT BUT DEADLY and my visit to the @starwars set TODAY on #GMADAY with @sarahaines and @michaelstrahan! Tune in at 1pET/ 12pC/P! https://t.co/sQwkc7uL6B
No bullshit, sir: I had meeting at @ww_us yesterday with some of the folks in charge and they knew all about you and your big reduction! They even said your name out loud before I did! Keep it up (or rather down), @DiscoD_83! You’re making us *both* look good! https://t.co/O4GBNiygpi
Nice! There was a little ratings bump for the episode of @TheCWSupergirl I was credited with directing! Thanks for watching, all! https://t.co/aUc363dw9v
Rumor has it that the new @Avengers trailer drops tomorrow on @GMA. And tomorrow morning, *I* will be on #GoodMorningAmerica to promote #SilentButDeadly (now available to stream or own). Coincidence? More like strategy. https://t.co/2JO4pAzExS
You’re fucked, Thanos! I just saw @captainmarvel soaring through space and blasting starships like she’s on a 70’s album cover. God is *this* woman! https://t.co/le91XgRkmo
You’re the hero! Look at that cape! Congrats, @JamieWalton! https://t.co/5q2dQKdFwa
I didn’t do the #Elseworlds tag from Earth 90. Pretty sure that was done by the amazing producing-director @JesseWarn - the super man who helps guide every episode of @TheCWSupergirl, even the ones he doesn’t helm himself! Loved seeing his nods to the Smallville heroes too! https://t.co/LMavetJB5I
Credit @erictcarrasco or the @SupergirlStaff. I can take credit solely for the idea of Roxie’s serious cereal-eating. She crushed that “You sleep weird” line so I’m sure she’ll be back in a future ep! https://t.co/KoC0v3rJZE
Seeing lots of love for last night’s @TheCWSupergirl! Many thanks, but I did not do it alone! Big thanks to @armenvfx for the assist, both digitally (Injustice glasses/phone gag) and directorially (Brainy, Nia, Kara captured)! Fun Fact: we BOTH survived heart attacks this year! https://t.co/j4anVyxWWK
My episode @TheCWSupergirl is about to fly! Let the Fraggle Dancing begin! https://t.co/89xPzAo4ik
All this fine food is Vegan, I swear. Had Saturday night dinner and Sunday brunch at the delicious @PSkitchenNYC! On that pretzel bun? A @BeyondMeat burger - my first since getting back from England! God bless America! https://t.co/nyQyhPqCwA
TONIGHT! I get the credit for “directing” the newest episode of @TheCWSupergirl, from a script co-written by Super scribe @erictcarrasco! Nia manifests her power! Manchester Black hunts Agent Liberty! And wait ‘til you see what happens to the Maiden of Might in the shock ending! https://t.co/8vN4bsvY9V
Anybody in Red Bank, NJ wanna drive a box of DVD covers up to NYC tonight? Will pay handsomely! It’s a midnight run!
Thank you to @ThePCCLondon peeps for hosting me again, thank you to the lovely audience who sold out my Late Night Oral session, and thank you, ladies, for tolerating this face when you visit your PCC toilets!

“Double tap to release, and thwip it out again.” Can’t... stop... The Feels! Take my stupid money, @SpiderVerse! Then fuel-inject me with pure comic book joy! I think right now, for many of us, this Spidey love letter is going to play like an emotional-Lee much-needed bandage... https://t.co/NdDGHvH0PF
Happy Birthday to my #FatManBeyond Bronx buddy, Mister @marcbernardin! This is your year, my friend! Enjoy all the success you got coming your way! And whenever you’re not busy crushing it, I’ll be waiting to stand beside you at the @SVCantina! https://t.co/ABHq9qadBV
Um... Zuck? The Buddy Christ statue and image belong to me. He’s my own personal Jesus and he lives at @The_SecretStash - a store I own. Based on the news lately, I’d have thought @facebook has a lot more serious concerns right now than telling me I don’t own something that I do. https://t.co/kgZ0ievGIX
Look at my face in that last picture. I’m not “directing” @TheCWSupergirl - I’m just enjoying it! And despite my involvement, the episode turned out great - all thanks to an amazing cast &amp; crew! See it this Sunday on @TheCW! https://t.co/7DNGEl1aOI
On a brand new SMODCAST! Scotty Mo tells us what it’s like to have his @grinchmovie open at #1! https://t.co/gkqdkK32fY
I, too, have been blue this week. But yesterday and today, I visited the set of a British flick and got to see how other filmmakers work. All of them were so passionate about the story they were telling, it served as a gentle reminder that Art is always good for what ails you. https://t.co/gAMXrTwtRi
If I had to guess? It’s because one of us has a big mouth and told too many candid stories that sometimes weren’t his to tell, and the other one is Ben. https://t.co/kwj82A20SJ
Had a dream I went to Windsor to pop by the newlyweds’ starter home with housewarming weed, only to get dragged away by Beefeaters as I yelled “You can’t do this to me! I’m an American and a fan of ‘Suits’!” When I woke up, I took @JenSchwalbach to see the majestic castle IRL. https://t.co/CPpsmdsyl6
Oy, David Brent! I’m in Slough! What say you, me, Tim and Dawn go out to a Q&amp;A at @ThePCCLondon on Friday, minus that Swindon lot. Tickets here:  https://t.co/wwg939VP3G #GarethKeenanInvestigates https://t.co/SYLLMmsJn8

I get handed or sent cool stuff with my face on it all the time. But I have no idea who made these awesome SModcast stickers and miniaturized copy of my book Tough Shit - and I wanna get to know the talented individual responsible for this sweet swag! So ‘fess up: Who made these? https://t.co/UGX4vk915h
Shop ‘til you drop without ever leaving your phone or laptop! It’s the @The_SecretStash #BlackFriday sale! https://t.co/7wxjqBIcmI
Here’s a 41 year old clip of @TheRealStanLee spreading the gospel of @Marvel to the @CBC audience back in 1977. So thankful that, years later, I got to call this guy a friend. https://t.co/lSE3pcA5Ls https://t.co/wIANgvjWMg
I have so much to be thankful for - but the top of the list is I’m Thankful to still be here for another Thanksgiving. And I wouldn’t be, were it not for the person who called the ambulance the night I didn’t know I was about to die. Many thanks, @JordanMonsanto! https://t.co/xQsPWymxXI
HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Take a moment to appreciate the people in your life who make it easier to be you! But remember: tomorrow we celebrate *another* important holiday as well... https://t.co/6jv5WmeLko https://t.co/hCs6wzUj5e
On this day 84 years ago, Walt @Disney was probably thinking “My character is a giant balloon in the Thanksgiving Parade! It will NEVER get bigger than this...” https://t.co/BFVvNKGn4G
And Julia is wearing noise-canceling headphones as well. This brings out the tearful feels: because somewhere, some little kid (or grown up) is seeing this and they’re feeling understood, represented and included. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! https://t.co/g6f7lq4d0r

My Mom is in recovery now but her hernia surgery went great! The Doc told us Mom’s stomach was up in her chest - so they pulled it out of her esophagus and reattached it, lifting it off of her heart. THANK YOU to the Doctor, the staff and you, for the positive vibes you sent! https://t.co/xyfWQXAVrb

If you’re in need of some giggles, SILENT BUT DEADLY is available RIGHT NOW on @iTunes! This is the standup special from Showtime that we shot 9 months ago on the night of my heart attack!

Farewell, my friend. You’re not only responsible for the boy I was, but also the man I am today. I will miss you all my days. Read it all here: https://t.co/3ni6SLKhWW https://t.co/6naCfXP7HO
People ask “Why don’t you ever make a comic book movie?” I did: Dogma was my @Avengers movie before they started making the real ones ten years later. So next year will be her 20th anniversary! Also: I was at my adult thinnest during that shoot. I now weigh less than I did then. https://t.co/DEX8Q5bY9i
I never had the courage to serve, so I appreciate those who fight to protect my way of life. To all the men and women who bravely sacrificed themselves for people like me, on this #VeteransDay, I thank you for your service! https://t.co/N9CR7IfirO
Watched @Avengers #InfinityWar again this morning before hiking Runyon. My current hot take: If all the previous @MarvelStudios movies combined equal “Star Wars” then #avengersinfinitywar equals “The Empire Strikes Back.” Discuss. https://t.co/K9ttLwIFGA
If you’ve loved Scott Mosier on SModcast the last nearly 12 years, check out his ginormous directorial debut this weekend! The @grinchmovie is now playing everywhere! So proud of and happy for my bro, Scotty Mo! https://t.co/ztHw0omhq6
Big thanks to @VeggieGrill for hosting me and my kid at their delicious Thanksgiving preview last night! I know I Tweet about them lots but #VeggieGrill is not just a restaurant to me; their tasty menu helped me save my life and lose the lbs! https://t.co/YrnNXuAKKZ
Thank you! But how weird: I wonder who’s asking the questions? And why? https://t.co/MsmSrQuMXk
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA! Anybody near #Malibu with a horse trailer, SYCAMORE FARM needs to evacuate 40 horses from 3661 Cross Creek Road before the fires get there! #WoolseyFire https://t.co/XJe0x85TBo
This man’s struggle with his guilt about surviving the shooting in #ThousandOaks hurts to see. Most of the victims were so young, their whole lives ahead of them. My heart goes out to all their families, as well as the family and friends of the officer killed in the line of duty. https://t.co/13aYYYK3q6
If I look different in this promo for my SILENT BUT DEADLY standup show it’s because we shot it the night of my heart attack. This is the face of a man on the verge of a medical emergency! Pre-order #SilentButDeadly now only on @itunes and get it on 11/13! https://t.co/12fIRuCFw7 https://t.co/BURfxgHgyX
I visited @RogersPlace a week or so back to see the @EdmontonOilers play. But I also got to explore the Oilers Museum, preview #Studio99, and shoot around with 6 time Stanley Cup winner Kevin Lowe! (This pro-Oil Tweet is not meant to trigger @NHLFlames fans.) https://t.co/9wkG54vQVf
After a lifetime of eating Turkeys on Thanksgiving, this year I’m gonna go bird-free and sponsor a Turkey at the @FarmSanctuary instead! (Please don’t feel triggered by this: I’m not telling you how to live *your* life - just telling you how I live *mine* now, post heart attack.) https://t.co/PigQID2I0P
We just voted as a family! On the way home, I asked “Did you guys see that lady casting her ballot dressed in the red, white and blue outfit? Patriotic much?” @JenSchwalbach said “That was @katyperry, bro.” Not sure if my wife’s correct, as I saw no sign of a Left or Right Shark. https://t.co/TtwurZjzgn
I voted for a Jen Schwalbach 20 years ago and her no-term-limits administration continues to provide this constituent with love, companionship &amp; nookie! I’m not saying you should vote Schwalbach specifically (keep your polls away from my wife) - just a reminder to VOTE today! https://t.co/vbhLWwRuzY

Please don’t let this article trigger you if you’re anti-Vegan. I’m not telling you to be a Vegan too - just relating what our family Thanksgiving is going to be like, post-heart attack. But for the Vegan-curious? When I dropped meat, cheese, milk &amp; eggs, I dropped 58 pounds too. https://t.co/sz0LoNgdy9

You’ve let nobody down, @DiscoD_83! Losing weight is a long process, so sometimes we just gotta cut loose.

Twinning it up with my Mom by wearing our @DestinationXL Bob shirts! Thankfully, I’ve had fans of what I do and who I am for 25 years. But this devoted booster beside me has been a charter member of the nonexistent Kevin Smith Fan Club since 1970. https://t.co/4cmuLD7EUY
To celebrate #WorldVeganDay, me and my favorite Vegan went to @VeggieGrill and ate our weight in plant-based fun food! But to be fair, this is pretty much how I celebrate every day. https://t.co/Is42yDER1F
My daughter was looking for Halloween ideas. I said “Maybe pick an important movie from 1994 and go as that,” I suggested, leaning on the wall that holds a framed CLERKS poster. “Great idea,” she said. Then she went as PULP FICTION. https://t.co/2hRqNfE5Dv
TBT - @JayMewes and I, many years and many pounds ago. Don’t forget to VOTE on Tuesday, Kids! https://t.co/eLoXC55d2e

Got to see the hours of material I shot in 2001 for the first time earlier this year. Estate said it’s the only unseen non-performance footage they have in the vault. Can’t imagine it doesn’t show up now as Prince was electrifying in it, preaching on the industry, music &amp; faith. https://t.co/UOZJA58FqR
I got to chat with the @sabrinanetflix folks at #NYCC last month - and today, I start watching their show! Cast your spell, @WriterRAS! https://t.co/AAHONx31A4
Tell him I love him and that he has all my respect for taking care of himself! But please also tell him Silent Bob says he’s wearing his baseball cap incorrectly... https://t.co/LRzM3GEVEC
I got my production physical for #JayAndSilentBobReboot, so the dream is getting closer to being a reality! The Doc said I had no idea how lucky I was to live through my heart attack before telling me about a surgeon who died of a Widowmaker while he was performing surgery. 😳
Looks like the first footage from #JayAndSilentBobReboot. You guys look great! @JayMewes? There's a new standard to uphold... https://t.co/lN6IgmhfoR

My Mom is back in the hospital. I feel so useless. If I’d studied medicine maybe I could’ve been able to treat her chronic pain. But oh no - like a self-centered dick, I had to become an “entertainer” instead. In any event, if you have the space, please keep her in your thoughts. https://t.co/Ko1xjzGTIc
He moved the headstones but he didn’t move the bodies! He had a wonderfully diverse career - but to me, James Karen will always be the voice and face of Pathmark. Huge bucket of win. Rest In Peace. https://t.co/x4qlhjeiqp

It’s time to BABBLE-ON! Hear last night’s ST LOUIS show, when @RalphGarman and I sang the Blues! https://t.co/SM8MijORhx
Ha! That means it’s a s-l-o-w news day - which is never a bad thing! Thanks again, @Im_Alex_Smith, for the fun lunchtime mini-quest! That little taste of home made my flight to Vancouver way better! And I’m sure @VeggieGrill is happy for the free commercial too! https://t.co/9nsRY7M81q
Pics or it didn’t happen you say? Well here is photo proof that @Im_Alex_Smith delivered my @VeggieGrill order to me at @fly2ohare like a champ! I’m now on a flight to Vancouver with a belly fulla @BeyondMeat! Thank you, Man of Moody’s! (Not pictured but Also present: @Emilee3D.) https://t.co/JfYx68wd5t
WE DID IT! @Im_Alex_Smith made the @VeggieGrill Run from The Loop to @fly2ohare in time for me to enjoy a little piece of home right here in Chicago’s airport! Many thanks for being The Bandit, sir! It was an adventurous, delicious layover! https://t.co/JgjjbdQvmz
Sorry, @Im_Alex_Smith! We took off and there was no WiFi in the air! Order emailed! Taxiing to gate now! We have an hour and change! The @VeggieGrill Run is the modern-day Smokey &amp; The Bandit! https://t.co/0j9GHFaMVX
Another Smith to the rescue! Okay, @Im_Alex_Smith: let the epic @VeggieGrill Run begin! My flight is taking off from St Louis now! Landing in Chicago at 11 and leaving for Vancouver at 12:45, so I would need the order by noon. Check your DM’s! https://t.co/VNGq8kVjVe
CHICAGO! I’m told my @VeggieGrill Run won’t work. The only way to make it happen is to have someone deliver the food to me at @fly2ohare! So - the VG at 204 North Wells opens at 10:30. My flight lands at 11. Any Chicagoans up for this? I’ll pay $200 and a photo (if you want one). https://t.co/mp8hwOhX6d
Last night in ST LOUIS, @RalphGarman and I did a fun-ass BABBLE at @ThePageantSTL! Then, we recorded a big, deep, stoner think of an interview for The Ralph Report! Subscribe and listen today! https://t.co/jflBW4v1fd https://t.co/sdLy3Eqyp0
Flying back to Vancouver from St Louis in the a.m. I have 95 minute layover in Chicago - where there is a @VeggieGrill by The Loop. Do I risk missing my flight and try to make it from @fly2ohare to #VeggieGrill before my next flight or is that nuts? Thoughts from any Chicagoans?

If nobody else can, @ChristophrWood! The Artist Formerly Known as Mon El stopped by the @TheCWSupergirl set, so we put ourselves on green screen - in case folks wanted to stick us in space or deface us with organs and eggplants and whatnot. https://t.co/jlbIeKoyio

Sometimes on @TheCWSupergirl, Brainiac transforms from a human to a Coluan. The effect requires expensive equipment and expertise to accomplish - but a great sense of humor helps. @jesserath is a man who has that sense of humor... https://t.co/Qc3e85fFjM
Thank you for thinking of our four legged friends! Hoping everybody (and every animal) is safe in Florida right now! https://t.co/plwJJZgLnU
Shooting PoCo today! This ep of @TheCWSupergirl I’m getting credit for directing was co-written by @erictcarrasco (pictured with me and all the Agent Liberty propaganda). Eric also wrote the first ep I ever directed. He’s the @DCComics fan who keeps things super on #Supergirl! https://t.co/7j3jQJ6PdV
Today I weigh 198! First time since high school I’ve been under 200 lbs! Thanks, @ww_us! To quote Prince, “Yes! It’s jacked! ‘cause I’m back! And I’m harder than a heart attack!” Read about it here: https://t.co/zwiKlyQoyf https://t.co/pzVV4TRvSd

Bat-Hamm! If the reports are true and Ben is no longer playing Batman? Jon Hamm would be tremendous! Read about it here: https://t.co/LxHQU8gJjC https://t.co/mKwaz9bqTw
One of the reasons I love interviewing famous folks for @IMDb is that I get to give them props for stuff they’ve done that I’ve loved. So a highlight of #NYCC for me was getting to gush at @SophieT about when she told Ramsey he was gonna die in @GameOfThrones. Watch it here... https://t.co/SAad4hsUiN
In the @Marvel COMICS, not on @Daredevil! You’re gonna get ME killed, @DeborahAnnWoll! (Nice meeting you and re-meeting @ejscott! Can’t wait to see Season 3!) https://t.co/dN6StahYGA
Dad and Daughter Date at @ChampsDiner in Brooklyn, complete with Vegan desserts! https://t.co/rtA9jJMe4I
Weed usually helps me. But also, sometimes I just go to sleep. Things are not always better when I wake up again but at least I’ve built up a little more strength to deal with whatever brought me down in the first place. https://t.co/Dp57BmvVn1
Took a midnight flight from Vancouver so I could interview folks for @IMDb at #NYComicCon today and tomorrow. Went to sleep before takeoff and woke upon landing to discover Jason Momoa was in the seat behind me all night. So technically, I slept with Aquaman.
Scott is back! Hear us talk about fire ants, Whitney Houstonologists and more on a brand new #SModcast! https://t.co/2wBh8fvz6H
All that remains of a sumptuous @VeggieGrill buffet that my favorite eatery sent up from Seattle for a @MelissaBenoist birthday celebration on the @TheCWSupergirl set today! Big thanks to Sivonna, Curtis &amp; everyone at #VeggieGrill for making this happen! Even non-Vegans loved it! https://t.co/L9spAr258G
Happy Birthday, @MelissaBenoist - @TheCWSupergirl to the world! Amazing Cast Assistant @DeadlyMovies had a custom cake made celebrating Melissa’s favorite flick, Jurassic Park - complete with sexy Jeff Goldblum! https://t.co/IhwiM96Wgd

Photographic proof that I met and talked to @AnnaKFaris (and the unseen @SimSarna) while proving myself @unqualified! https://t.co/MFn5zS7JOV
Hear what I sound like on another podcast as I, too, prove I’m @unqualified. https://t.co/DmnAvIcspx
I've watched the flick 20 times now so it's safe to say @Avengers #InfinityWar is easily my favorite movie of the year. I love it so much. When I smoke a joint and watch it? It's the best picture of the year. When I smoke 2 joints while watching it? It's the best movie ever made.
No matter how many times I watch @Avengers #InfinityWar, I still can’t believe the price Thanos was willing to pay for the Soul Stone. Like seriously: fuck that guy. I hope @captainmarvel makes him eat shit, then shit out that shit, then eat that same shit. Repeat to infinity.
Weirdest side benefit to dropping the pounds that I’ve discovered? I can cross my legs when I sit in public now. No more manspreading for this thunder-thighed thoroughbred!
To be fair - a) I never said it was a terrible idea; I just made fun of it. b) Of course an ongoing show about a guy playing with his bows &amp; arrows could work; it has for years on another network. c) Take all my opinions on #FatManBeyond with a quiver fulla salt. https://t.co/jHUl1Nlzwy
After 10 days in Vancouver to prep my ep of @TheCWSupergirl, I came home for the weekend to write, record a new #SModcast and eat @VeggieGrill with the family! And while this may sound like an ad, it’s not: I’m just a #VeggieGrill fan. They don’t ever pay me; I have to pay them. https://t.co/ZvsABQbHG8
“Hartford? The Whale? Hey, they only beat Vancouver once, maybe twice in a lifetime.” https://t.co/i3f8QjtGyU

Liz Destro is my tireless producer from @YogaHosers &amp; the forthcoming #JayAndSilentBobReboot! She has a movie in theaters now that I love called LIZZIE, starring Chloe Sevigny (as ax-fan Lizzie Borden) &amp; Kristen Stewart! Go see it if you can! It’s unnerving, fascinating &amp; bloody! https://t.co/wKqzMi2WE5
I’ve eaten at great Vegan restaurants up in #Vancouver while prepping my ep of @TheCWSupergirl. But since I had the weekend off, @JenSchwalbach &amp; I drove down to #Seattle to hit my favorite plant-based eatery on the planet, @VeggieGrill!

Early morning text from my brother regarding Batman’s dick. I don’t have the heart to tell him I’m the writer who once made the Bat wet himself... https://t.co/PI9N5oqiFP
Good morning, #Vancouver! This was my view when I opened my curtains at the @SuttonPlaceHtl. Thinking of suggesting it as a location for my @TheCWSupergirl ep, since there’s an art-directed quality to the garbage. Might try to find an old box of Mr. Sparkle in this trash heap... https://t.co/0AQOdTV98s

The @StanAndOllie movie looks like it’s gonna win my heart and a few awards! Hey, @JayMewes - this means WE might get a Jay &amp; Silent Bob biopic one day, long after we’re gone! https://t.co/eJSPlBVgah

"And until we meet again, boys &amp; girls - know that wherever evil lurks, in all its myriad forms, I'll be there with the Hammers of Justice, to fight for decency and defend the innocent." - Batman: The Brave &amp; the Bold, "Mitefall!" Happy #BatmanDay! https://t.co/E7xTATKWuk

Come solo or bring a furry friend to see me &amp; @RalphGarman BABBLE this FRIDAY! Tickets a the link below! https://t.co/j4tS1HWya8
I had a blast asking Panos, Linus and Nic all about #Mandy! What a fever dream of a film! It goes beyond “Beyond the Black Rainbow”, if that’s possible. The two leads give career-highlight performances in one of the best films of 2018. Mindfuckingly next level filmmaking. https://t.co/GNnn4sfA6s
VAN-GROOVY! I’m coming back to town to “direct” another fine episode of @TheCWSupergirl! But the night of 9/25, @marcbernardin joins me to rock the first ever #FatManBeyond in The Great White North, at the unsinkable @RioTheatre! Tickets at link below! https://t.co/v2WgDXAklr
On a brand new #SModcast! Get out your tissue box as @AdamRifkin tells the tale of the ten years it took to make the beautiful @Last_MovieStar with his hero, #BurtReynolds! https://t.co/13sor27xbr
I was asleep in Toluca Lake when Mom called me from Jersey, yelling at me to turn on the TV because we were under attack. The news showed one of the buildings I'd seen in the NY skyline every day of my life while growing up falling down. The TV stayed on all week. #NeverForget
HEAR this week’s brand new BABBLE-ON! And then buy tickets to see me &amp; @RalphGarman do it LIVE at the @HollywoodImprov on FRIDAY! https://t.co/Ti42CxcQ6H https://t.co/Ks1zRjJwjW
CALGARY! EDMONTON! I’m coming to ALBERTA in October to play with @RalphGarman and to play with myself! Come see me BABBLE at #BellaConcertHall or come Q me for A’s at the #MyerHorowitzTheatre! https://t.co/ODrfYkXFyN

Good morning! I’m headed in to @Power106LA to talk to @JCRUZ106 about BABBLE-ON (this Friday at the @HollywoodImprov) and Hollyweed and getting healthy! I’ll be on-air at 9:30! https://t.co/xgoCvoZ4LF
A big part of my motivation was that I was paranoid someone would suddenly make a movie about working in a convenience store before *I* did. https://t.co/CrIT5jH25m
You won’t get shit from me, I assure you. I still love that saccharine little flick. It’s got 100% more George Carlin than most movies. https://t.co/saHMlw2aKQ
Met my hero Rufio at the @FarmSanctuary yesterday. He was born paralyzed in his back legs, but look at him with his little cart: all determination and joy! We don’t always have it as easy as others in life - but sometimes we meet generous folks who help us fly. Or even just walk. https://t.co/QLjDoOGJyN
While visiting the @FarmSanctuary, I saw this owl in a tree. Nature, man... https://t.co/UPHu3VWaPx

This is the 5th time this week that I’ve hiked #RunyonCanyon. It’s sweaty work but not as hard as it used to be for me to do. And tomorrow, the dork who made @YogaHosers is going to try actual Yoga for the first time... https://t.co/BPuRMENlKJ
Just bawled my eyes out watching the beautiful gem #TheLastMovieStar - in honor of the late, great #BurtReynolds. @AdamRifkin - you gave him such an amazing gift with this flick. The scene where he apologizes to Claudia is some of Burt’s career-best acting. See it on @itunes now! https://t.co/dq8qKxoUD8
As THE movie star of my childhood, the Bandit stole our hearts for decades. I always loved how Burt Reynolds worked with his friends as often as he could and then showcased the fun of movie-making in the end credits of his flicks. He was true American icon. Hate to see him go... https://t.co/jaMZjJA4e8
You sure it was your wife? Because that sounds exactly like my wife. https://t.co/s1DFMDUYv1

Of course! Send a self-addressed stamped envelope to @tuskthemovie  at 35 Broad St, Red Bank, NJ 07701. In 4 to 6 weeks, you’ll receive what seems like an empty envelope. But in the envelope will be all your time back (plus I’ll throw in a l’il extra time too, for your troubles)! https://t.co/AHh8Tg4T4o
As an official @WeightWatchers Ambassador, let me incentivize you, Bri: you stick with your program and I’ll stick you in an episode of #Hollyweed (shooting in Oct/Nov)! https://t.co/6wexBI5XZk

If you love the @Degrassi theme song, this is the extended version with the rap verses. It's one of the most positive and hopeful songs ever recorded (and what I was singing in the O.R. during my heart attack). You can get shit DONE with this anthem. https://t.co/9xnIFTscR9
FRIENDS AND FAMILY: I lost my phone! If you get a text from a number you don’t recognize, it’s likely me. My safe word will be “PillowPants.” Also? I lost a few pounds since this @DailyMail pic on the left was taken. Read about it here:  https://t.co/PCdm9rHHJG https://t.co/vqKv9udNfY
Happy Labor Day Weekend, folks! I know most of us resent having to work for a living. But aside from the money, the workplace can better us as individuals, introducing us to new people and different points of view. Because of a 9-to-5er, I met @JayMewes - and he changed my life. https://t.co/6R2mD5h5YT
Back in 2010, @RalphGarman and I recorded our first HOLLYWOOD BABBLE-ON at the old #SModCastle! Next week we head back to the @ESA_OC in SANTA ANA to celebrate our 8th anniversary! If you're interested, get your tickets here: https://t.co/2i0QsfiC1q https://t.co/qBmBIA4NaT

Same guy, I swear. Pic on the left was taken in 2008 at age 38 when I weighed 330. Pic on the right was taken today, age 48, weighing 205. I look younger now that I’m older. Read about it here: https://t.co/gBHsFSOMOR https://t.co/u5Nd1cu2Fo

6 months ago yesterday, I had a heart attack. The Doctor told me to lose 50 pounds, but I have a problem doing what I’m told. So I lost 51 pounds instead. Read about it here: https://t.co/4qDos9qgJx https://t.co/oLEkNdVJov
I’m happy with how my life turned out, don’t get me wrong. But in quiet moments, I wonder why *I* wasn’t enough for #PeteDavidson. I mean, I was saying #GodIsAWoman years before @ArianaGrande. It’s not fair... https://t.co/KTibGqRpJd
WEDNESDAY! Aladdin can show you the world, but I can show you the UNIVERSE! Lemme walk you through @TheDCUniverse and show you what’s in store with guests galore on the #DCULiveStream! https://t.co/dWfqb0SlpT
Mood: Feeling Accomplished. Just finished the Second Draft of the big thing I’m working on. I’ll do one more pass tomorrow before submitting it Monday. But for now, I’m celebrating with Nachos at @VeggieGrill then heading to the @SVCantina for the #Edumapubquiz at 4! C’mon down! https://t.co/Phaqb7KHjZ
LOS ANGELES! Come to the @SVCantina at 4pm TODAY and take the #EdumaPubQuiz with me &amp; Professor @EdumacationAndy! You can show off your big brain while winning movie props, costumes or even the shirt off my back! (Awesome ad art by @DarkNateReturns.) https://t.co/BUSYXFf7bU
Listen to this man! He’s smart! https://t.co/TAsPAU4p6Z
This is Adam Karpin’s son, Jack. He’s a #FatManOnBatman fan. Watch how he reacts when “Kev-Kev” is onscreen. My *own* kid is never this excited to see me! Absolutely adorable!  https://t.co/kaA9CCmY9h
This plucky dog invites you to come see the man she owns BABBLE with his buddy @RalphGarman at the @HollywoodImprov TOMORROW at 10! Look at her l’il face! Can you really refuse her? Get your tickets here: https://t.co/FnbL9DQJNB https://t.co/Spkcc8LJsp
I was at the @DCComics offices in Burbank yesterday, and I went to the @MADmagazine floor to say hello. There, I saw this Alfred E. Neuman statue from “Up the Academy” - the only movie Mad ever made. As a kid who begged his parents to buy him Mad every month, this was everything. https://t.co/PEJsMd49bi
This feels very self-serving but here goes: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KEVIN SMITH! https://t.co/YeKQSHFPJX
Last night, @marcbernardin &amp; I recorded a brand new #FatmanOnBatman LIVE at the @SVCantina. Tonight, you can watch that show at the link below to see if we talked about you while you weren’t there. https://t.co/3PP5DTP2nJ
Sporting the @JonSchnepp pin that was given to me by @hollykpayne last night at #FatmanOnBatman. Wearing the dearly departed King of the Sweaties close to my heart. https://t.co/PD6ubipOXN
Felt down after a website shamed me for 25 yrs of making pretend. Made me question why I got into the game in the first place. Then my kid texted me a link, writing “Our music is on @Spotify!” Her joy at creating brought the sun back for me. Hear it here: https://t.co/qNHhtgMLnq
One Week from Today! I’m gonna show you what @TheDCUniverse is gonna look like when the #DCUniverse app officially opens for Bat-business this fall! https://t.co/dWfqb0SlpT
Thanks! My favorite moment in any of my flicks is when Randal finally reveals a terrified dreamer beneath his nihilistic front as he bellows “I’D BUY THE QUICK STOP AND RE-OPEN IT MYSELF!” That’s how I think of myself now: I’m Dante &amp; Randal, once they realized all they can do. https://t.co/DQvR5cGHAG
So glad you came to the show tonight, @hollykpayne! And thank you for the @JonSchnepp cameo pin! Now I can wear the #KingOfTheSweaties close to my heart! We all miss you, Schnepp... https://t.co/dX8RlsBcgO
Um... @ScottWamplerBMD? The article is unchanged on your site. The entire premise of the piece is that I’m writing a Hit-Girl comic that I’m not writing, which you’ve now heard directly from me, the writer in question. So why’s the piece still there, uncorrected? Asking Tim next. https://t.co/HxPp7xOBVi
A follow-up post is considerate but if you really want to keep it awesome, please delete or at least correct the current piece. As it stands now, it’s predicated on a version of my Hit-Girl series that you now know doesn’t actually exist. Thanks, man! See you at the movies! https://t.co/yB13ecP0Eb
Classy, sir. I truly appreciate the Tweets and the sentiments and I apologize for my dig. That being said, given the new info I’ve provided about what the Hit-Girl comic actually is/isn’t, maybe @bmoviesd can publish a correction or addendum to the piece that brought us together? https://t.co/uusHsni8Y9
You sure did, sir. You questioned my character and you also called a Tweet of mine misogynistic in the process. The only problem is I didn’t write the Tweet. My response here: https://t.co/WlhlkxZKqX https://t.co/Vff7f9rqD8
PROUD DAD ALERT! My daughter &amp; her friend have a band called the tenth and they just released an EP on @iTunes!

TONIGHT at the @SVCantina! Me &amp; @marcbernardin reunite for the first time this month to chat Bat and speak geek! It’s the return of #FatmanOnBatman at 7! Get tickets here: https://t.co/fsKHrdXfR7 https://t.co/jO7rwVa5H5
I was unfamiliar with the product when we shot this ep. The Props Dept. gave me options; I picked your cuff simply because it looked futuristic. 2 weeks later I had my heart attack. Ever since then, I have used your awesome device nearly every morning to track my BP. #ProudOwner https://t.co/SQRemkeLyB

After 10 days in #Sarasota shooting #KillRoyWasHere, I’m finally back home in the Hollywood Hills, walking with my wiener on full display. As a @WeightWatchers Ambassador, I’m angling to get my little exercise partner a gig in the #WeightWatchers Office of Canine Relations. https://t.co/cGWPYFqNYj
Shout out to the @RitzCarlton in #Sarasota &amp; manager - who heard me on the @joerogan podcast talking about how I ate baked potatoes to kickstart my weight loss. When I checked in 10 days ago, I found this treat waiting: a vegan chocolate cake designed to look like a baked potato! https://t.co/Nv7R2K3MdH
From the moment I saw her tell the Blues Brothers to “Think” Aretha Franklin was my Queen of Soul. I once dressed in drag as a PMRC activist in a high school sketch to belt out “Respect.” She had the voice of God. Sad to see the icon has gone but relieved she left us her music. https://t.co/N0WXueB0So
TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8! @RalphGarman &amp; I return to the @HollywoodImprov to BABBLE about our betters! We do comedy any way you want it! Tickets here: https://t.co/QpvIRpNUBa https://t.co/SZKpnN9zJ6
I like being listened to but I love being heard. ‘atta boy! (#SilentButDeadly - now on @Showtime.) https://t.co/MJpWJy5W0b
That’s an homage to FARGO. But to be fair, the podcast that was the basis for @tuskthemovie was inspired by a real (but fake) ad placed on @Gumtree by Chris Parkinson: https://t.co/9cOkNdtHfj https://t.co/KMjZ3Ey0zL
Last night, in the wilds of #Sarasota, The Gator Chaser was on the hunt! @IAmJericho joined us on the @RinglingCollege horror anthology #KillroyWasHere to play a sinister streamer! Read about it here: https://t.co/GbtiPLcCbD https://t.co/a1rjQUVJYc
When “manhood” is in quotes, it can be a reference to genitalia. So while I may not speak for @VancityReynolds or @rickygervais, I think I ask on behalf of all of us: Why do you think sexual organ slang is cool? Does it enhance your manhood (meaning your male identity, not dick)? https://t.co/JJFSWuqTXP
Been searching the @VANS_66 site, @amazon &amp; @eBay looking for another pair of these bad boys. But today, my sweet savior emerged from the back of the @EllentonPO #Vans outlet store with a fresh pair of yellow fuzzies! Total score! https://t.co/oOV5wUcON9
I'll be honest, sir: it ain't all Vegan Nachos, free parking and hand jobs when you're a Kevin Smith. But the position is not without occasional charms as well. Welcome to the club! https://t.co/Nip7N4geIH

I said #WalrusYes to @tuskthemovie (now on @netflix) based on episode 259 of #SModcast. The origjnal story we riffed on was born in fits of giggles &amp; guffaws. But when I made the flick, I wanted it to be as serious as Argo. So yes it’s dark - but that, to me, is part of the joke. https://t.co/qziC8Xsp8f
If you’ve got some spare change, send it the way of the “Shooting Clerks” Kids! They’re working on their finishing funds via @Indiegogo! https://t.co/dFscLEihfp

Thanks, man! Now that @tuskthemovie is on @netflix, I’ve been seeing lots of belated #WalrusYes Tweets. It delights me to no end. We may not have lit the world on fire during our theatrical release, but the flick’s slowly turning into what it was always meant to be: a cult film. https://t.co/IMG8WcXHKa
Silent Bob bought a box of sugar and a Plucky Duck candy container (I was a big Tiny Toons fan). I edited out the payoff, in which we saw Jay eating the sugar from the box as the ambulance pulled away, saying “I knew one of those motherfuckers was gonna kill someone some day...” https://t.co/YjKujSoX7X
Mom? https://t.co/8YtDjYXb2l
A family trip to @The_SecretStash. You’re gonna make me cry, sir. I remember going to the @ErnestTubbRS with my Dad and seeing him transform from Father to Fan. Meant the world to me to know he geeked out too. So thanks for the store visit and for sharing my world with the kids! https://t.co/PNEtdGFkqG
The Nun who Loki used The Walrus(Yes) &amp; The Carpenter to disillusion was played by @bettyaberlin - the same Betty Aberlin who faced down the devil on our Sarasota set just last night when Killroy Was Here! She could’ve used a little backup from Good King Friday or X the Owl... https://t.co/tn9StI32US
Are you talking about my Winnie the Pooh moment in “Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back”? Because that was my stunt double, Matt. But I think I could fit in that pipe now regardless. https://t.co/DsliiUTr9r
My Podcast Pictures. First there was @tuskthemovie, then there was @YogaHosers (you can now watch both flicks back-to-back on US @netflix). To eventually complete my True North Trilogy, I just have to get #MooseJaws made one day... https://t.co/7M9gjQC4hE
I’m back in Sarasota shooting the rest of the anthology horror flick “Killroy Was Here” that we started last summer with the @RinglingCollege kids! This is our First A.D. @ariellezadok. Today, totally by accident, we matched - wearing pink to ward off alligators. They hate pink. https://t.co/Acg2HnH5XC

We are mere hours away from the start of Vulgarthon 2018! But your @eventbrite ticket will not get you into the @BowTieCinemas - you need to stop by @The_SecretStash when the doors open at 7:30am tomorrow to pickup your WRIST BAND and welcome bag (t-shirt, pin and signed photo)! https://t.co/dmwrwTFM7g
CONGRATULATIONS! But if the forces of evil should rise again to cast a shadow on the heart of the city? Call me. https://t.co/vamTPdvVfy

Speaking of Canada, it took a few years, but my Manitoba-set horror flick @tuskthemovie is finally on @netflix!  https://t.co/OuitUJzS8o https://t.co/yPJ0rpkarb
Because in my world, God is Canadian. I even made a whole movie about it once. https://t.co/JNkTXkFkDA
By the powers invested in me by @WeightWatchers as Ambassador, I now pronounce you, @netheadww, less of a man! In a good way! Congrats, man! #weightwatchers #Freestyle https://t.co/BuSuIFuCwc
On a brand new BABBLE! @RalphGarman and I return to the @HollywoodImprov to heckle our industry betters! https://t.co/zE5LBWsa95
Just finished a huge writing gig that I haven’t talked about publicly yet. It’s the most massive IP I’ve ever been allowed to play with and if the powers that be decide to move forward with the project, it would be the biggest budgeted anything I’ve ever done. Wish me luck...
On a brand new #FatmanOnBatman! We cover the @aquamanmovie and all the @Comic_Con news with guest host @erictcarrasco until @marcbernardin gets back from his @castlerockhulu premiere! Plus: special guest @Pernilleoe tells us about designing the DC Superhero Girls! https://t.co/utillAF6P6

Hear what my Hall H panel sounded like at @Comic_Con 2018 on a brand new #SModcast! https://t.co/GC2jlKBWGK
See or hear the second ever edition of the #EdumaPubQuiz with me and @EdumacationAndy, recorded live at the @SVCantina this past Sunday! https://t.co/oD6tbnF2jZ
I love the @voxdotcom series EXPLAINED and was delighted when they asked me to narrate the WEED episode. That episode is now up on @netflix! It’s only 20 mins long and packed like a bowl with interesting info! https://t.co/2H3Pwn7D9V
D’oh! My bad, but I’m happy to hear the corrections and elated that the RoboCop sequel is to the Weller original! Hear me &amp; @marcbernardin get shit wrong at @Comic_Con on a brand new #FatManOnBatman - https://t.co/WLerBacLCx https://t.co/at9T4GJdOO
SATURDAY NIGHT! Come to the @HollywoodImprov and watch @RalphGarman talk to himself while I giggle along on a brand new BABBLE-ON! Tickets here: https://t.co/RDtCBfJOg2 https://t.co/4CjQQ8k7xg

TONIGHT! At the @SVCantina! It’s a @Comic_Con comedown episode of #FatManOnBatman! I’ll be joined by @TheCWSupergirl writer @erictcarrasco subbing for a late-arriving @marcbernardin (who’ll be coming from his @castlerockhulu premiere)! A few tickets left: https://t.co/zXdtRYb0fY
Above: My @Comic_Con 2015 Hall H crowd after @starwars stole the show. Below: My #ComicCon 2018 Hall H crowd for me &amp; #Hollyweed. I suspect most folks were there to get a gander at The Clerk Who Lived just in case my heart attacks me again, but I appreciated the crowd regardless! https://t.co/llH3gdzyyZ
I stood amidst the impossibly in-shape casts of many of @TheCW network’s finest shows all weekend while aboard the @IMDb boat at @Comic_Con and I managed to somehow blend in with the physically fit! Thank you, @WeightWatchers! Only a tiny bit further until I hit my goal... https://t.co/Gd2BUNHtIs
One of the best moments in @starwars history. That scene destroys me: https://t.co/jQPlSZY9VQ https://t.co/X8RDNh2IEd
It’s time to BABBLE the fuck on! Hear me &amp; @RalphGarman tellin’ tales at @Comic_Con! Recorded live at the @americancomco! https://t.co/YHCXMHsmJi
You guys sure knew your shit! Such a fun night at the @SVCantina with @EdumacationAndy and the #EdumaPubQuiz! Thanks to everyone who came and played! https://t.co/tqT5ZvU8wn
Get smart and make your brain-y thick and veiny at the #EdumaPubQuiz with me &amp; @EdumacationAndy! Win cool shit, like movie props and Funko Pops! It happens today at 4 - only at the most stellar geek bar in the galaxy, @SVCantina! https://t.co/LmIj5CcjdB
This was honestly one of the best moments of my career AND life. Receiving an Inkpot means more to me than receiving an Oscar. Thank you Eddie and everyone at @Comic_Con International for adding me to this prestigious list of folks whose works inspired me: https://t.co/WlDUw6WdJC https://t.co/N9mvmuXa4Y
Miss you, @JonSchnepp. Wish you were here. https://t.co/nve23tFUX9
AT 6:45 IN HALL H! Come hear me talk about #Hollyweed and see the @grantgust &amp; @CavanaghTom short film TOM &amp; GRANT at annual @Comic_Con Q&amp;A! After that, I get to BABBLE-ON with @RalphGarman before I head home! https://t.co/hafRtBd2dw
We go live from the #IMDboat at 3:30 on @Twitch! Then I do my Q&amp;A in Hall H at 6:45! We’ll be talking #Hollyweed and showing the short flick TOM &amp; GRANT and talking to @grantgust and @CavanaghTom! https://t.co/fBSsiDsS2H
This is the #IMDboat crew watching the @aquamanmovie trailer! Look at the joy in my face! James Wan is doing for the seas what @Guardians did for space! LOVE the screen-accurate Black Manta! LOVE the armored sharks! LOVE Mamoa as Arthur Curry! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Go, @DCComics! https://t.co/wixpEth0ip
This is terrible. @JonSchnepp made me and many others so happy with his work (@TDOSLWH is one of the best documentaries I’ve ever seen). And beyond his art, Jon was a truly good and decent person. My heart goes out to you, @hollykpayne. If you need anything, we’re here for you. https://t.co/gvk0nG3XCS
“Carry me, Hodor.” This is the face @KristianNairn makes when you ask him to hold the door. Day 2 of sailing the sunny seas of @Comic_Con aboard the #IMDboat starts soon! Visit @IMDb to see all the videos! https://t.co/OUuIx46CUb
Love my buddy @RalphGarman on BABBLE? He’s even better by himself! Rise with randy Ralph every morning when you climb aboard his solo flight, The Ralph Report! You can get some expert oral from a cunning linguist for only $3 bucks a month! Join the #Garmy today! https://t.co/bG8wOUftix
Not sure if this will make it better or worse but that wasn’t me. I’m sorry if this ruins an anecdote you’ve been sharing since the heady days of MySpace but not everybody is who they say they are on social media. I once thought Kristen Wiig Tweeted me but it wasn’t actually her. https://t.co/olCKJwiMhx
The good folks at @DollarShaveClub (sponsors of our #FatmanOnBatman, #Babble &amp; #TESD podcasts) made an adorable short film about the things we do when we’re alone in the bathroom! Totally worth a watch! See it here:  https://t.co/OtEcwUwhTN
Dear @Variety: First you steal our #IMDboat at @Comic_Con idea, then you invite me over for an interview and misidentify me as @KevinJames?!? Yes, we’re both middle-aged butterballs - but there’s an easy way to tell us apart: he’s in the Mall Cop movie, I made the Mallrats movie. https://t.co/5vj5WkIYID
An Army of Me! Cosplaying Kevs &amp; Co. on the #IMDboat! Visit @IMDb for our @Comic_Con coverage all weekend long! https://t.co/tOtjFxFsiH
Setting sail on the #IMDboat with #ShaneBlack and his @Predator cast @KeeganMKey, @ThomasJane &amp; @oliviamunn! Head to @IMDb for videos of all my @Comic_Con interviews at sea! https://t.co/jhX2qrKzvM
When I Was a Kid, Robin would say stuff like “Holy egg shells, Batman!” But in 2018? Robin says stuff like “Fuck Batman.” Oh, @DCComics app! I’ve got some $$$ for you... #ComicCon2018 https://t.co/EYmAshWufd
THANK YOU, @SnoopDogg! That’s high praise from a fellow traveler of the green! If my #Hollyweed campaign on @RivitTV gets the green light from the fans, please come be in one of the episodes with @donnellrawlings &amp; me! Let’s play wild, Joker!  https://t.co/9kB4szYO4K https://t.co/4ofMz7BY5N
Such a great day for us true believers and an honor for our hero, @TheRealStanLee! A real @Marvel Merry Marching moment! Was lucky to even see it, let alone be involved! https://t.co/Qz29Dsrk4L
It’s the HOLLYWOOD BABBLE-ON Coloring Book! Meticulously drawn &amp; designed by the brilliant @ErikPflueger, these beauties will get signed by @RalphGarman &amp; me and be available to buy after every episode of Hollywood Babble-On, starting at Saturday’s sold out San Diego show! https://t.co/gQ8RFHtcvD
Headed to @Comic_Con this week? Here’s where you can find me or my friends on Thursday, Friday &amp; Saturday! You can also see me atop the @IMDb boat interviewing folks or catch me in Hall H for my Q&amp;A show on Saturday night, with guest appearances by @grantgust &amp; @CavanaghTom! https://t.co/45NrFccvMJ
You can bring bags but try to remember the comfort of others if you’re stuffing it under or near your seat. #Vulgarthon is gonna be a ton of fun, so bring as many shirts as you need! But remember: you’ll be getting a V’thon shirt when you pick up your tickets at @The_SecretStash. https://t.co/hTsyEDeE5H
And we’re done! Wasn’t that fun? Don’t forget to check out #Hollyweed on https://t.co/SoqrJA0gNY #AskKevinSmith https://t.co/aQi8wkFLAt

The sweetest guy in this business is @JonSchnepp, the titan behind @TDOSLWH (one of the best documentaries about movies ever made). He’s fallen ill and faces staggering hospital bills. I’ve donated some loot and stand ready to fundraise further. Please help a good man if you can. https://t.co/lmWP7mWnUW

I'm doing a @Twitter Q&amp;A TOMORROW at 11:15am PST! Gonna be talking about the @RivitTV show #Hollyweed under the hashtag #AskKevinSmith. For example: Who made that insufferable @YogaHosers movie?” Ask Kevin Seth... https://t.co/IQRORFQTzH

Andy’s built a deck of queries that’ll boggle even the most trivial of minds! https://t.co/YoTUgkT2wj https://t.co/ylRYAmcaQJ
Went to a late show with @MalcolmIngram and saw the heart melting @MrRogersMovie. Seek it out as soon as you can but warning: tissues are useless against this movie. Bring a beach towel. Mr Rogers wasn’t in it for the money, fame or ambition; he was genuinely in it to help kids. https://t.co/GkygtEJSPH
Technically, I once identified as a “super fan”. That count? https://t.co/UVq0wSSu9p
This is the description I wrote for my first flick in the CLERKS press kit, circa 1993. I was a little off with the @starwars stuff. https://t.co/UdNYDpo21v

When the @PUBG event on @TwitchPrime was over yesterday, we all won a special performance by @deadmau5! https://t.co/ENdq2qGpQF
What an amazing night at! Toronto loved @tuskthemovie! The rest of the world? Not so much. #TIFF https://t.co/7W8ZfAfzaX

It’s FRIDAY THE 13TH! Hide out from a chasin’ Jason Voorhees by joining me &amp; @RalphGarman TONIGHT for a brand new BABBLE-ON! We’re thinking of subtitling it either A NEW BEGINNING or maybe JASON TAKES MANHATTAN. Get tickets here: https://t.co/Cc58KlSXrV https://t.co/3cKGfKAIkC

It’s gonna be EdumaFun! https://t.co/FeUWIAaHSM

This summer marks the 31st anniversary of when I saw the @beastieboys at @TheGarden. Even though it’s been three decades, not much has changed: I still gotta fight. For my right. To paaaaaaaaaaaarty. https://t.co/WTYN4Hi1MU
When we shot #Hollyweed back in early 2016, we made an @AntMan joke. But thanks to sitting in mothballs since then (and thanks to sequels), the joke plays as timely! Watch the Hollyweed pilot FOR FREE! If you like it pre-buy some eps to help us make more! https://t.co/db14E37XDZ https://t.co/S7RxinXf2F
Wanna see what CLERKS in a weed store looks like? Watch me try to act with words coming out of my mouth in the pilot of #Hollyweed! If you like it, help me &amp; @RivitTV green light a whole season by pre-buying a few episodes! To see the first one FREE, go to https://t.co/NvouiTs2uo https://t.co/ggl1fM8j1M
Years ago, @donnellrawlings &amp; I shot a pilot for a show called #Hollyweed that was essentially CLERKS in a dispensary. Now, @RivitTV is giving it a second chance at life! See me acting with words coming out of my mouth! Watch the pilot FREE and (if you can) help us make more! https://t.co/plqtQRyL0b
This is me coming from @VeggieGril. I wanna go back in time a year and try to convince me that within six months, I’ll be Vegan and wearing my 1997 outfits. Then I wanna go back further in time and maybe take out Baby Hitler. https://t.co/GBBbL4tHUP
I’ll be on the @IMDb Show LIVE at noon! Gonna talk about dropping LB’s with @WeightWatchers and tell you how to sample some #Hollyweed! https://t.co/AkcWdEmaB4

It’s #CowAppreciationDay so here’s my shout-out to Cows! I used to appreciate you for your milk and the burgers! Now I’m a Vegan-ass grass-eater just like you guys! So now I don’t eat Cow, feel free to call me if you’re in the moo’d for @VeggieGrill!
FRIDAY NIGHT! Watch @RalphGarman Bond with the audience when BABBLE-ON returns to the @HollywoodImprov! Get your tickets here: https://t.co/2ehAZfdCt3 https://t.co/KXe5Jl0Nce
I will kill any man who tries to get between me and this movie on August 3rd. Damn you @Disney - just when I think I’m out, they pull me back in! Investing heavily in @Kleenex as we speak... https://t.co/pIUHU3N1vV
If, due to a time travel device or the Force, there’s a plot development that allows Lando to repeat his EMPIRE STRIKES BACK line “There’s still a chance to save Han!” and get us back to that fateful bridge on Starkiller base? Then I’ll kiss JJ on the mouth. I’ll French him even. https://t.co/Tf1B4ppnmG

The Kev in this clip doesn’t even know what a podcast is yet. He thinks he’ll just be a filmmaker his whole life, if he’s lucky. This clueless kid has no idea about all the oral adventures he’ll be going on soon (which sounds filthier than I meant it). Wish I could tell him... https://t.co/G1jW60Dwej
I appreciate that, sir! Nearly killed me to make #SilentButDeadly - but in the end, everything worked out for the better. Thank you to @comedydynamics &amp; @Showtime for making this video record of the weirdest night of my life... https://t.co/qC4KeplePE
Bird update! L’il pigeon baby is almost in the hands of a bird rehabilitation pro! Thanks for all the tips (except the cooking suggestions): one of your suggestions led to the bird nestling into far better wings than mine.
Driving up my hill, I saw this little bird stumbling around dazed in the middle of the street in the 100 degree heat. Brought him home but I’m not a bird person; so I don’t know what to do for the little guy. Is this a baby? Anybody know what kind? Thoughts on how to care for it? https://t.co/hQ1HUFdMdL
SANTA ANA! Like your famous winds, @RalphGarman and I blow into town to BABBLE-ON at the @EsportsArena TONIGHT at 9! Get tickets here: https://t.co/ArAMHjWbhE https://t.co/LWNWuN2OHs
When I stopped buying weekly comics I was afraid I’d suddenly grown up. Then I realized it was just more fun for me to write comics than read them. I went from passive to active participant. It’s nice to be in the congregation but when you’re in the pulpit, YOU pick the prayers. https://t.co/gePgWZu9hC
When I write, I’m like an emo kid: I want to be left alone. Everything from Mallrats forward was written on @apple laptops. I can write with orchestral music on but harder (for me) with any lyrics playing. I write, stop, read, then rewrite. And before I know it, the day is gone. https://t.co/1Ge1ZWklxZ
Spider-Man. Dr. Strange. The Question. The Creeper. Shade the Changing Man. Hawk &amp; Dove. He worked with @Marvel AND @DCComics.

I’m usually on stage somewhere so I don’t get to see much comedy here in Hollywood. But I love @nbcsnl so I went to @TheLaughFactory tonight to see #CecilyStrong &amp; @melissavcomedy perform at the @WearYourVoice benefit. They crushed, as did the rest of the lineup! Still laughing!

August 2 is my 48th birthday! After the heart attack, I know I’m not even supposed to *be* here today, or that day. So to celebrate, I’m throwing a 20th Anniversary #Vulgarthon at the Red Bank @BowTieCinemas! A day of 5 films followed by 5 podcasts! 337 tickets go on sale FRIDAY! https://t.co/3zyi2RraFr
Happy Canada Day from the wannabe Canadian who made @tuskthemovie &amp; @YogaHosers! #CanadaDay2018 https://t.co/5XQPG14hC0
HAPPY CANADA DAY! Here’s a pic of me with Canadian Queen and God herself, @Alanis! Read all aboot it: https://t.co/yX837Z6Ek3 https://t.co/AgMApNOIkd
This @mikeymusto article about the DOGMA premiere at @TheNYFF is from a 1999 @villagevoice. Baby Harley (who is 4 months old) wore angel wings, @JenSchwalbach wore black and @JayMewes (behind her) wore white. Just out of frame: a few hundred protesters praying the Rosary at us. https://t.co/UlTvfWHImW
This is the premiere invite for Mallrats, dated October 1995. The after-party was at BB Kings - a restaurant up at @CityWalkLA that later became the @JonLovitzClub, where @RalphGarman and I did BABBLE-ON for years, prior to moving to the @HollywoodImprov. https://t.co/gDvwmYTsEb
NO! Not NC! I’m talking NJ! I’m looking for a @VeggieGrill to open in Red Bank, New Jersey - preferably near @The_SecretStash. https://t.co/Lzh4LTwR2b
“Smith clarifies he isn’t really criticizing Affleck’s portrayal but rather had a preference for the potential continuity that could’ve been maintained if WB had not launched a brand new universe disregarding the Dark Knight films.” Guess that part couldn’t fit in the headline... https://t.co/4AomNUyyza
Wanna network? If you go to @charitybuzz, you can bid on Hollywood power meetings, lunches with stars, VIP experiences &amp; lots more! All proceeds directly support @WomenInFilm's programming &amp; initiatives to achieve gender parity in the film industry. https://t.co/O9aBOiqFay https://t.co/9lNDCQN2pm
We met on the @Disney lot. You and I are both working on secret stuff that we can’t talk about yet. I insisted we take a selfie. So now, your photo is ready... https://t.co/798KbvSlAh
I have a hard time making fun of others (which is why I tend to turn inward and mock myself). And honestly: even though I’ve worked with him twice, I’m way okay with not being invited to this Roast. But it does kinda feel like a... what’s the term I’m looking for here? A cop out. https://t.co/oGLqUCqDTz
What a legend! Writer with a capital W! Harlan taught us that people and their motivations are the heart of even the most profound science fiction. And he taught me the true days of the week are Someday, Moansday, Duesday, Woundsday, Thornsday, Freeday and Shatterday. RIP, Titan. https://t.co/99WoyxjDL5
Because of a throwaway directive on an 8th Grade Spelling test, I’d spend the rest of my life trying to be neat. Alas, I could never be described as much more than nifty. https://t.co/On1LCJzA6O
I just binged Season 1 and I LOVE this show! @frankieshawisag took an excellent @sundancefest short film and turned it into one of the most original, hysterical &amp; distinctive series I’ve ever seen! And the Mother/Daughter match with @Rosie is pitch-perfect! Brava, Frankie &amp; Co! https://t.co/iGtDukkR9F
I’ve been thinking about this quote all day and I’m pretty sure it refers to the audience. Anyone else have a different read of it? https://t.co/DJNc6JOxfJ
Dear @VeggieGrill: I’m a recent Vegan convert who loves your eatery and applauds your move into Boston! If you can, bring a #VeggieGrill to Red Bank, NJ! https://t.co/H6m2WYVfTP
I’m such a fraud: the guy who made DOGMA couldn’t score higher than 83 on an 8th Grade Religion test. https://t.co/tnQXfAvFBx
Even when I’d ace a test, I’d still catch some shit. But in 1984, I was far too mature to knee-jerk attack any criticism with dry-witted rebuttals or hissy fits. That wouldn’t happen until my 2010 battle with critics over “Cop Out” (when I was nearly 40 and at my least mature). https://t.co/eNaYMLDurh
8th Grade Kev displays his math genius in 1983. When you flunked this hard, your Mom had to sign your test - and even my biggest fan felt the need to editorialize with “Very careless.” But look at my cursive; any handwriting analyst can tell you it’s the scribblings of a psycho. https://t.co/PQPSeTUy94
Digging through some of my old stuff that was in storage, I found this Smurfs folder containing a bunch of my grade school tests! Let’s see exactly what kind of student I was... https://t.co/8f9CKG5L93
So we took Harley out to lunch at @RealFoodDaily for her birthday before seeing @TheIncredibles. When I went to pay, the waiter told us @CasperVanDien picked up our check! Johnny Rico to the rescue! Many thanks, sir! Very classy! I owe you, my friend! https://t.co/1PdA4pfbH4
Happy 19th Birthday to my only begotten child, Harley Quinn! You are the fulcrum upon which the lever of my world rests! https://t.co/kq9CmjWFvG https://t.co/6ENhJ0eBpD
Easy to deny. The only @starwars or @MarvelStudios movies I’m involved with are the ones I pay to see in theaters. Promise. https://t.co/QmeZ4kAZOh
After 96 episodes, the @ComicBookMenAMC are now the Cancelled Book Men. On a new #SModcast, hear Walt, Bry, Ming, Mike &amp; I hold a Viking funeral for our @AMC_TV show and reminisce about the happy highlights of seven seasons! With big @TellEmSteveDave news: https://t.co/C5HSs6H2F1 https://t.co/Ij6Rf9Suh8
Happy Birthday @candicekp! You bring our Iris so vividly to life every week on @CW_TheFlash and provide the blood that pumps through the hearts of #WestAllen shippers everywhere! Hoping to see you on set soon! https://t.co/e94f4fMoha
People ask me why I always look like somebody stuck a finger up my ass in photos. It’s partly due to the 23 yr old asshole in this video. Homey barely smiled &amp; was so low energy. Now when I step in front of a camera, I try to be entertaining &amp; energetic.  https://t.co/oz71AV9BKh
Awww! Thanks for that! The @Avengers panel was a little hard to keep on the rails toward the end, but the audiences at @ACEcomiccon were generally lovely on both Friday &amp; Saturday. Hope everyone has a good time today! https://t.co/gYi5Ny2E0w
Bad News Bears. Jaws. Man for All Seasons. Strange Brew. Do the Right Thing. Empire Strikes Back. My Favorite Year. Animal House. Vacation. Breakfast Club. And I nominate @RalphGarman! https://t.co/ITvHghWOVj
I found the Winter Soldier! Sebastian Stan kicked off the @Avengers panel at @ACEcomiccon before being joined onstage by Tom Holland and Anthony Mackie! https://t.co/yYmPWgETT0
Silent Bob gets between Vision &amp; the Scarlet Witch at their @ACEcomiccon panel. #ElizabethOlsen and #PaulBettany did the @Avengers proud. Audience was lovely. https://t.co/2VbuEdW2rc
Elizabeth Olsen &amp; Paul Bettany talking to a naked calves buffoon about #InfinityWar at the astounding @ACEcomiccon in Seattle an hour ago! Watch the @grantgust &amp; @Avengers panels on the Ace FB page: https://t.co/Nn1MdOVPkh https://t.co/KR4A92cgKQ
The kids did great! It was a fun, informative panel! @ACEcomiccon has been tremendous so far! @grantgust &amp; @Avengers panels next at 4 and 6:30! https://t.co/S70lgPkzwH
Wanna see the Vision &amp; the Scarlet Witch panel? Go to the @ACEcomiccon Facebook page and watch the live stream! Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are in the house! #AceComicCon https://t.co/mokPn2AtEQ
I am! I’ll be taking pics at the @ACEcomiccon today at 5:15 - after moderating the @grantgust panel at 4 and before moderating the @Avengers panel at 6:15! Headed to the Con now to moderate Vision &amp; the Scarlet Witch panel at noon! https://t.co/UGvYwsZXD8
We’re just a couple of kooky kids who’re weight-watchin’ with @WeightWatchers! Excellent seeing you at @ACEcomiccon, sir! You’re doing great! https://t.co/PuPnJnL6Fc
I had a great night at @ACEcomiccon in Seattle! Tomorrow I moderate panels with @CW_TheFlash and lots of @Avengers! https://t.co/bqDorMdIYb
4 ladies in their 20’s, just hanging out and lovin’ life! We were like a west coast Sex &amp; the City! https://t.co/N0UgMTydZN
Ooo! Can I play? I know @JayMewes and he’s pretty fucking famous! (Also: we have HUGE episodes of #SModcast and #TESD dropping on Sunday night that are packed with very big news! Clear your schedules! https://t.co/FIEuqNHIyY
This is a picture of the first time I saw @JenSchwalbach in her diamond thief catsuit on the #JayAndSilentBob Strike Back set. She’s skinny and I’m not so we kinda look like the number 10. https://t.co/hOz0RbcYZe
In 1986, it cost $11 to go to @UniStudios (I had a cousin in the military so we got a discount). At the same park in 2018, that $11 might get you a Duff beer outside @TheSimpsons ride. https://t.co/uA3s0udX06
Anyone have .50 cents? After debating it for 44 years, I think I’m finally ready to join the Bionic Woman Action Club! (Kidding: I joined back in ‘76. Had the doll and everything.) https://t.co/YhOdSA0sXl
Going through old stuff in my office so I’ll be Tweeting pics of what I find. Apparently this August is my 31st anniversary of going to see @rumdmc at @TheGarden, via @NJTRANSIT. It’s also the 31st anniversary of the moment I decided not to throw this out. #Horder https://t.co/xINqojJ5CW
This is the letter that changed my life: an official acceptance notice from @sundancefest for Clerks. Weeks before I got this, even though the film was dead with no future, I still kept telling myself “I am a filmmaker.” Weeks after I got this, I wouldn’t be alone in that belief. https://t.co/9gnO3pml0c
Going through old stuff and I found this @InterviewMag from 1997, promoting Good Will Hunting. Matt does not appear to like dem apples... https://t.co/9ogvgV3Hbj
SEATTLE! Come take pics with me and see my Q&amp;A at the @ACEcomiccon TOMORROW! Or come to the Con on Saturday to see me moderate panels with both @Marvel AND @DCComics heroes - including my homey @grantgust from @CW_TheFlash! For tickets: https://t.co/F7acYLz5Zy https://t.co/W1WItT7GpO
On the huge-vanity... #NationalSelfieDay https://t.co/vWt8qK4szV
To be fair, it’s a big deal when I only nearly cry and don’t progress immediately to flat-out bawling. Thanks for the kind words, @usweekly! https://t.co/VoKEF1G1iZ
This is fantastic, @ErikPflueger! You’re crazy gifted! @JayMewes! Look what awaits you in Naples! https://t.co/8SIz89qwnz
The Great White North is now the Green White North! Congrats, Canada! I hope we’re next! https://t.co/mrl6jp0Pje
TONIGHT! @marcbernardin &amp; I wanna take you away from the real world and bring you to the @SVCantina - where we’ll talk about the only reality that matters: fantasy. #FatManOnBatman - Tonight at 8! https://t.co/4fgcd61lq0 https://t.co/pSRVWr524m

Thanks for the correction and the hyperlink to our #FatManOnBatman podcast, @IndieWire! @marcbernardin &amp; I truly appreciate it! https://t.co/vKbkrqYuQW
Question to my fellow digital journalists at @IndieWire: doesn't it bug you when another outlet copies your work entirely without linking back to where they got all their info in the first place, or even acknowledging the podcast's co-host (@marcbernardin)? Bugs us as well... https://t.co/3HO3bsrcqa
HOLLYWOOD! Tomorrow night, we get FAT at the @SVCantina! Get geeky in our wretched hive at 8pm! https://t.co/4fgcd61lq0 https://t.co/uG5V07DNh3

Supergirl and Wonder Woman! I saw the amazing @MelissaBenoist in her opening night performance as Carole King in @BeautifulOnBway and the @RealLyndaCarter was there to cheer her on as well! If you’re a fan of @TheCWSupergirl, go see the show! Melissa is flawless in it! https://t.co/TmWPdEL6CN
A big ol’ BABBLE happened on Friday night! Here’s what it sounded and looked like when @RalphGarman &amp; I talked @Drake and @Degrassi... https://t.co/k1kcNcnt5X
Here’s a promo I shot for tonight’s @JokersWildTBS before my heart attack and subsequent weight loss. Certainly not saying I’m now @SnoopDogg skinny but I am thinner than the me below. #JokersWild - TONIGHT at 10! https://t.co/ijrWHZhzAt
East Coast! Watch my pride and Joy clash on @PyramidABC - RIGHT NOW! https://t.co/wcrYNWGtM0
I lost my Dad years ago. But when I was 6, he took me to see The Bad News Bears - which is still one of my favorite films. For all of us without Dads, perhaps Coach Buttermaker of the North Valley League can pinch hit with this Dad-like advice that applies to life in general... https://t.co/Uwtrjigj4Q
Happy Father’s Day from a @WeightWatchers ambassador who is physically a little less of a Dad than he was last year! https://t.co/EXWrJz2PZK
Co-directed by the talented, funny half of SModcast, Scott Mosier! https://t.co/27KJckdRFv
Tell you what: I will send a personalized @OriginalFunko Pop of me to the next 10 people who donate $100! https://t.co/yA2G689Ibe
Mr @marcbernardin &amp; I welcomed the writers of @Avengers Infinity War to the @SVCantina for an excellent episode of #FatmanOnBatman the other night! But at the end of the show, they both snapped their fingers and *SPOILERS!* Suddenly, half the audience disappeared... https://t.co/8dtVQKZPl3
G’morning! Tune in to @ALT987fm to hear me &amp; @RalphGarman talking to @987Woody about working at @kroq and tonight’s BABBLE-ON at the @HollywoodImprov! For tix: https://t.co/vWosz6IM3K https://t.co/MHLLb1IAIN
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to Hollywood for BABBLE-ON tomorrow night! I’m gonna tell @RalphGarman the story behind the amazing @Drake &amp; @Degrassi video for I’m Upset! Get @HollywoodImprov tickets here: https://t.co/vWosz6IM3K https://t.co/fjQ6E24k8A
Thanks to @Drake for letting me &amp; @JayMewes go back to @Degrassi one more time in the most transgressive (and expensive) ep of Next Generation ever made! Loved it! But you &amp; Karena melted my heart with the then-&amp;-now cast credits and theme song ending!  https://t.co/eYOlNdzDZO
This is very positive news as well as a great example of the power of journalism! The @THR story on @TheRealStanLee crisis helped save a living legend from the scurrilous scams &amp; vile vampires to which our “Generalisimo” had fallen prey! Thanks #THR! Stan means the world to us! https://t.co/Z2OXFqImnO
Fuck you and take all of my money! Right now! Oh God I need this movie in my head, heart &amp; soul STAT! If @Dumbo is half as good as the trailer, it may just have mended by broken heart... and then broke it all over again! If I wind up back in the hospital this trailer is to blame! https://t.co/nQy1UWF4HC
What a great photo! And what a great night! @Avengers screenwriters Markus &amp; McFeely were wonderful, informative and legit funny guests! Thanks go to @marcbernardin, who hooked us up with the mighty @Marvel magicians! https://t.co/dMT1dApB9M
I’ve watched a buncha movies over the course of my life and rarely ever identified with the hero. But after watching @DisneyPixar flick “Brave” on my flight home, I now realize why: it’s because buried under the hockey jersey &amp; all this flab beats the heart of a @Disney Princess.
I’m not pushing this as a cure for depression, but whenever I’m blue (it happens) and I need a reminder of my outlook on life, I watch this movie clip. Ever since I saw this as a kid, I’ve tried to make my life “a perpetual spree” too: https://t.co/NXnLl0PMaO
Last night on the set of a music video, a very sweet 20-something woman asked me “Were you the guy in the ‘Because I Got High’ video?” It was the rare example of someone not asking me “Are you Kevin James?” - to which my stock response is usually “Only on the inside...” https://t.co/p5Yo3hD0fP

SEATTLE! I’m coming to @ACEcomiccon on JUNE 23rd &amp; 24th to talk about the only reality that matters to me: Fantasy! While in attendance, I’ll be doing photo ops as well as moderating panels with some of the stars of the @Avengers! So get your tickets NOW:  https://t.co/F7acYLQHo8
What an incredibly generous offer! Everything I’ve read about @FromDuskTillDog is all raves! But it’s too expensive a proposition for you guys to fly out &amp; work for weeks to make my dogs like each other. And the stubborn Woofers would likely break you before you could train them. https://t.co/OJLIKwC9Oj
You and your family are adorable! Hope you enjoyed #Toronto! https://t.co/SQbjFsDn43

TORONTO! I jumped out of a car driven by @MalcolmIngram while at the corner of Dundas &amp; Spadina just to say Hi! https://t.co/ouQhM4rHIa
Ooo! Can I guess? Is it the career longevity? The same enduring charm of the classic “Space Age Love Song”? The hair? Also, I don’t think anyone ever leads with “The question is, Alex” because time is of the essence on @Jeopardy. And finally, you neglected to close your quote. https://t.co/GNmmIDDqvw
That was me. For a flabby Walrus man, I can move like a Cheetah when I need to! https://t.co/DR7pMBiHK6
I don’t think the Suicide Prevention Hotline is staffed by robots, but I included the number in the Tweet in the first place because some folks who need it won’t look it up. I do what I can but I’m not a trained professional. Thank you for the positive outlook, Cap’n Sunshine. https://t.co/ResCsASgnG
Never met him but I always liked the way Anthony Bourdain seemed to conduct his life. By all reports he was a good man. So sorry to hear a pair of dreamers &amp; innovators like him and Kate Spade are no longer with us. If you ever feel like self-harming, help is here: 1-800-273-8255 https://t.co/D0NVFHkXEb
Watching @TheCWSupergirl herself fly in NYC and vocally soar, as @MelissaBenoist makes her Broadway debut in @BeautifulOnBway! We’re at the intermission now. Spoilers: Me-Me is crushing it! Tears over here! https://t.co/dQxnRUzrar
No show this weekend but NEXT FRIDAY, we will BABBLE-ON! Join me &amp; @RalphGarman when we gaze &amp; giggle at Hollywood on our home turf, the @HollywoodImprov! https://t.co/Pj8avPYiqm

G’morning! Don’t forget to Vote today. Doesn’t matter who you vote for, just exercise your constitutional right to vote at all. Because if you don’t vote then you can’t bitch about the results - and throwing shade at how people voted is about as American as baseball &amp; apple pie! https://t.co/0Cw6q7EUVH

I’ll be okay with it. I love consuming SW, ST, DC &amp; Marvel but they were never what I wanted to do in film. I got into the biz to make Kevin Smith movies. They got plenty of people in Hollywood who wanna make big movies. But if I don’t make Kevin Smith movies then nobody will. https://t.co/FkOD5sEQ12
Ever see my Funko Pop Kev jersey? If you like it, for the next month, you can get one just like it from @The_SecretStash! Details below... https://t.co/dSVC2cQOZo

Watched the four new episodes of the always excellent doc series the @toysthatmadeus on @netflix and loved every second - especially this @StarTrek commercial from the 70’s that made me miss my SModcast partner-in-crime... https://t.co/rig1FxToPU
4 times in my career, I flipped an @MPAA rating without making a single cut, using only my mouth (to argue). I got Clerks from NC-17 to R, Jay &amp; Silent Bob from NC-17 to R, Jersey Girl from R to PG-13 &amp; Zack &amp; Miri from NC-17 to R. When I won with Z&amp;M, Ethan Noble gave me this... https://t.co/rhL8QObLfK
If he is, I happily concede. But I referred to Adam Carolla on the @joerogan podcast with zero mention of PodFather @adamcurry. And since Dan didn’t reference Curry in his Tweet either, I made what I’d consider to be a fair assumption. But, when we ass-ume... https://t.co/dIJk5DS3YL
Love you too, so take this correction with affection. From Wikipedia: “The first episode of the show, which was at the time titled The Adam Carolla Podcast, was released on Feb. 23, 2009.” And the first episode of SModcast was released on Feb. 5, 2007. SModcast is 11 yrs old now. https://t.co/GapVtdh7NP

My own shows? You mean @ComicBookMenAMC? Are you saying I should suck up more to @mingchen37 or @TellEmSteveDave? Are you also saying I can’t like both @Marvel AND @DCComics characters and stories because I have to be loyal to one over the other? #DorkMatter https://t.co/30CFya9nxM
I just finished my final #HitGirl comic book script for the 4 issue mini-series I’m doing for @mrmarkmillar! Had a blast writing it!

This was an engaging read that made my flight home breeze by and had me reflecting on my own extended family. I always loved Lucy on #Degrassi and I was delighted to read about Anais’ American/Canadian origins. This is worth your time! https://t.co/KkNIds3ybE

I’ve got sold out shows at @zaniesnashville w/ @JayMewes tomorrow, but tonight I hit the @ErnestTubbRS - an artist-owned retail establishment that a 5 year old Kev visited with his Dad in 1975. Part of the reason @The_SecretStash exists is because of this multitasker’s example. https://t.co/6JqxCDmhbs
Ran into my Dogma buddy Matt Damon yesterday but couldn’t get a word out of him. Snubbed by the Martian. I say bad, Will Hunting... https://t.co/A6gpTrjyTQ
Tried to hang out with my Zack &amp; Miri pal @Sethrogen today but he’s just so fake now. Hollywood has turned this once grand Canadian into some kinda lifeless mannequin. I could wax on forever about his plasticity but instead I’ll just say this: there’s nothing real about this guy. https://t.co/2spStjpHJt
Mom &amp; me &amp; Brother Don. I’ve known these cats for over 47 years. But I’m not sure I see any resemblance... https://t.co/nxr1SqKxku
I mean, @tuskthemovie wasn’t unique or creative enough for you? Convenience stores and malls exist in the real world - but a Frankenstein Walrus? That’s a flight of fuckin’ fancy, my friend! I honestly can’t GET more creative than that. https://t.co/jG2c4jctu2
Thanks for coming to see me at @ThePeel! (For the curious, this is the part of the show where I levitate.) https://t.co/t6Yzr3lfYm
The Kid, the Wife, the Dork, his Mom &amp; his Dad at the premiere of Jay &amp; Silly Bob Strike Back. I work in film and Harley grew up to be an actress - all because the guy on the right took me to the movies throughout my childhood. Thanks, Pop! You changed TWO generations of Smith’s. https://t.co/6LAkZHvI6Y
Had a blast at @HighDiveGville last night! Next stop on the Super Ville-an Tour? Jacksonville tonight! https://t.co/P2SOSwTS2u
DOGMA poster design from 1999 that was never used. Under the title you can see the names of @JayMewes and George Carlin (and me, as an actor). Some different photos used and the dated tag line refers to the old, angelic @CBS show. https://t.co/SiL80nvzeW
“37?!?” I’ve lost 5 more pounds since starting @WeightWatchers #FreestyleEffect! That’s a grand total of 37 out of the 50 lbs the Doc told me to lose! And I lost the last 5 while eating fun foods I actually enjoy! Thank you, #weightwatchers - from a grateful #WWAmbassador! https://t.co/UNGXlvOYDw
So #SoloAStarWarsStory is fun fan service cinema that made me smile a bunch &amp; flap my fanboy fins! Han meeting Chewie is a secret origin scene a lifelong @starwars enthusiast like me never dreamed I’d ever get to see and it was beautiful! Congrats to the Kasdens &amp; @RealRonHoward! https://t.co/XMyM2m25AO
I was a big fan of Tom Wolfe’s BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES book and I’ve seen THE RIGHT STUFF fifty times. This man’s work improved my vocabulary and captured my imagination. Fare the well, Wordsmith. https://t.co/ORNPKHXKhc
Watch me be all talk and no action on my @Showtime special, #SilentButDeadly! https://t.co/egKIaMaWQ8
SANTA ANA! Come see me &amp; @RalphGarman BABBLE-ON at the @EsportsArena on JULY 7th! Tickets now on sale! https://t.co/ArAMHjWbhE https://t.co/HmtTJEqaws
Congrats, man! You know you’ve made it when your movie plays the @ChineseTheatres! I can’t wait to see your doc! https://t.co/SUcnfCURvq
Happy Mother’s Day to @JenSchwalbach - the Mom who made me a Dad! This Motherfucker loves you for making and raising such an awesome offspring! You remain now, as you were then, the amazing Matriarch of our little family! https://t.co/OOmQIDwncn
This was absolutely lovely to read and my Mom loved it! Many thanks for the kind words, @lizlet! “Silent But Deadly” is now playing on @Showtime and streaming on the #Showtime app (up North, see it on @CraveTVCanada)! https://t.co/BOdL2IUdBD
PRINCE GEORGE! I’ve been to Canada but I’ve never been to you! This’ll be my first trip to Northern British Columbia, where I’ll do some FAT MAN ON BATMAN with @marcbernardin at @GGMBrand #NorthernFanCon18! Join us at 7:30! https://t.co/TlPNSB4cJz
PRINCE GEORGE! Tonight’s the night! Come see me &amp; @marcbernardin do FAT MAN ON BATMAN at @GGMBrand #NorthernFanCon18 at 7:30! https://t.co/eTcdGrwkQ7
CANADA! Now you can stream my new comedy special “Silent But Deadly” via @CraveTVCanada! In the U.S., see it streaming on @Showtime! https://t.co/gTtlyrmj5Y
TONIGHT! Watch me try to kill onstage before I nearly died backstage! It’s #SilentButDeadly - only on @Showtime! https://t.co/oqbNpLu6ML
Thanks for making my @Showtime special, @comedydynamics! Can’t wait to see it TONIGHT (though, to be fair, I lived it)! https://t.co/OaY5zv4HoF
VAN-GROOVY! The last time I was in town, we saved the @RioTheatre together! I return TONIGHT with sexier intentions: to bombard you with sweet oral pleasures! Come see me alongside my BABBLE brother @RalphGarman at the @commodorevcr at 7:30! https://t.co/mWGQipdny7 https://t.co/UYYIdavrZd
Congrats, Austin! But if you were never sick enough to miss a day of school, perhaps you might be Unbreakable - in that @MNightShyamalan kinda way. Beware of Mister Glass... https://t.co/Lplr56cnsi
Watch as @JayMewes &amp; I herald the Game 7 win of the @NHLJets in Winnipeg tonight! Thanks for selling out our show at the Club Regent Casino! https://t.co/xTLVlUSXxF
TOMORROW! My standup show Silent But Deadly debuts on @Showtime! If you’re looking to kill an hour on a Friday, I can promise lots of oral! https://t.co/xljHht0mbJ
I return to the Source from which all good things flow on a new SMODCAST when I visit @The_SecretStash in Jersey and record with my unwitting mentors, @TellEmSteveDave and Walt Flanagan! https://t.co/jWnytitSia
WINNIPEG! I know tonight’s @NHLJets Game 7 starts the same time as our sold out show. We asked the venue about delaying until 9 but they’d rather start on time and have folks catch the end of the game. Either way, @JayMewes &amp; I will be providing game updates during the show. https://t.co/GyQheMLoSK
First off, I’m sorry for your loss, sir. Second, contact @JordanMonsanto and give her your address so I can send you something to make up for missing the show and to repay the kindness of offering up free tickets during what I’m sure is a tough day. My condolences to your family. https://t.co/8WPRvAf1oZ
Damn... Parks is gone a year already. The Old Man made me a better storyteller during Red State and @tuskthemovie. You honor him with this documentary, @JoshRoush! https://t.co/sOkedNgoYN
EDMONTON! We BABBLE tonight at 8:30! There are some tix left here: https://t.co/XfSw33RSuO https://t.co/Vsm0PbpOPw
Anne Coates was the legendary cutter of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, but I met her as the editor of CATCH &amp; RELEASE. She summoned me to the edit bay once, where she told me, in her British accent, that she loved my performance and felt I should do more acting “with words.” RIP, my friend. https://t.co/G8UBoXHlrk
CANADA! On my way up to see you TOMORROW! Here’s an UPDATE! https://t.co/vVwFdxP3ai
CALGARY! I have to cancel tonight’s BABBLE-ON performance and I’m absolutely apologetic about it. Please read below... https://t.co/lCJBtjJ8cX
This is a gorgeous gift from the Construction/Paint on Team@CW_TheFlash, commemorating the 3 Flash episodes and the 3 @TheCWSupergirl eps I’ve directed! Absolutely love it! Many thanks, you crafty Canadian craftspeople! https://t.co/5h4ftZECkC
They’re hyping @LukeCage season 2 with @EricBandRakim! I bought “Paid in Full” on cassette the day it came out. “When I’m gone? Then you can joke!” https://t.co/IKuONE8PMd
First time back since the heart attack. My wall is still here to support me, like brick and mortar Giving Tree. https://t.co/ReThJ4zHVa
Lots of folks reviewed @Avengers #InfinityWar. But at this link, you’ll find my hour long #Avengers recap: https://t.co/ZbDFyeYfUX https://t.co/BtKzeYcaSX
Then I’m failing! Because the ENTIRETY of all my podcasts should come off like The Narcissistic Kev Show. That’s what podcasts are: homemade talk shows in which the host thinks anyone would/should give a shit about their opinion/boring-ass life. s’All I been doing for 11 yrs now. https://t.co/bkoGXUriIJ
Take a look inside yesterday’s Funko de Mayo signing at @The_SecretStash and watch me talk about my Mom’s favorite kind of pornography in this @AsburyParkPress article and video! https://t.co/64mJeusv5t
I was born in Riverview Hospital in Red Bank (building on the left, where Harley was also born in ‘99). This morning I waked &amp; baked to this view, thinking “Maybe the heart attack didn’t get me in Cali because I’m meant to end up back there, where I started. A circle-jerk life.” https://t.co/R80ypwOaHG
President Austin says “Feeding the homeless is the highlight of my life!” He’s 4, he gives out sandwiches, he wears a cape. This angelic toddler makes me wanna be a better adult. https://t.co/r3BIbOkaDN
Thanks for your patience! The signing was supposed to go from noon until 3. We wound up going from noon until 7 instead. But we got to everybody who made it into the line before it was capped! (And then I took pics out front with any folks who didn’t make it inside.) Great day! https://t.co/pMqm3ZuNTf
TOMORROW! It’s #FunkoDeMayo at @The_SecretStash! Come get your @OriginalFunko Pops signed by me &amp; the @ComicBookMenAMC! Starts at noon! And my Mom’s gonna be there too! https://t.co/kj1xNgDYLx
Yes! I’m coming back to CALGARY on TUESDAY to BABBLE-ON with @RalphGarman! It’s gonna be a stampede of dick jokes, so get your tickets here: https://t.co/VHyVirGcnF https://t.co/5hN47KvAvp
MAY the FOURTH Be With You! Celebrate @starwars by sparking up your lightsaber and letting the Force flow through you! https://t.co/sCT0JGozPu
OUTSTANDING show, Mr. @springsteen! I laughed lots and cried more as you took me on a storytelling journey across your legendary life! You are America’s poet laureate and New Jersey’s best achievement! Thank you (and Patty) for the best night out at the theater I’ve ever enjoyed! https://t.co/l0hbNA0geQ
“And my machine she’s a dud, I’m stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey!” My view for the @springsteen on Broadway show at the Walter Kerr Theater tonight! I’m ready to watch The Boss go to work! https://t.co/dVVoktmzoU
Here it is! 24 yr old Kev refusing to dance at the @patmastroianni Christmas party in December ‘94! Beside me: @TellEmSteveDave and @MalcolmIngram. Malcolm had invited me to a party he wasn’t invited to, so Pat was sweet enough to accommodate a couple of Jersey boys up North! https://t.co/4yhqBHi1V6
I donated, sir! I hope others follow suit so you can hit your goal! You rock, Sean! Hang in there! https://t.co/LA4KCuTTHP
There was video proof of the time that @MalcolmIngram hoodwinked me &amp; a baby faced @TellEmSteveDave into attending a Degrassi party at the house of @patmastroianni! Malcolm said we were invited but we weren’t - thereby turning me into an unwitting party-crasher! Pat! Re-post it!
Just got to hang with @TellEmSteveDave at the @jimandsamshow. For those that don’t follow this kinda thing that closely, I based the characters from CLERKS on me and Bry. So this is what Dante and Randal look like in middle age. https://t.co/HTqdYA1BlW
On my way to the @jimandsamshow to talk about my @Showtime special! Hear my dulcet tones around 10-ish! https://t.co/Up2tWpluLA
DO NOT! There’s always something better about to happen! You wanna leave your world behind, switch zip codes! Move and live any place else - but LIVE! Bad days can be crippling, yes - but good days are our salvation. Your life is not a joke; your life is an opportunity. Take it. https://t.co/K7AM1eIyyB
Look at me shamelessly trying to seduce @StephenAtHome last night on the @colbertlateshow as I explain where my dick is. Watch the interview here: https://t.co/gkneLQKj3R https://t.co/LPS1pFUEKU
Right now! Tune in! https://t.co/KbaYT65TZm
Here are 2 ways to see me today without leaving your house or your job! I’ll be doing a @facebook Live at 11am EST on my FB page and then at noon EST, I do @BUILDseriesNYC! I’m promoting my May 11th @Showtime special but I’m talking about whatever you wanna talk about! https://t.co/yQoOinvTzr
Made my second trip ever to the @colbertlateshow last night to promote my May 11th @Showtime special! Had a great time but I forget to let @StephenAtHome ask any questions. Watch here: https://t.co/gkneLQKj3R https://t.co/VdNiM8sH8i
If you’re still awake on the east coast, I’m about to be on the @colbertlateshow! I’ll be the one who’s on after Helen Hunt. The guy in the hockey jersey talking to @StephenAtHome. https://t.co/XsZpj524hT
TONIGHT! I’m on the @colbertlateshow promoting my May 11th @Showtime special and telling @StephenAtHome what it was like to have my heart suddenly attack me out of nowhere like a little dick! https://t.co/J7po4jjgTY
Even as @Avengers dominates at the the box office, @MarvelStudios releases an @AntMan &amp; the Wasp trailer that’s fun &amp; stunning! Congrats, @MrPeytonReed! What a terrific taste of lots more @Marvel! July is only three months away... https://t.co/Y7tbl64RFg
Hear the brand new episode of HOLLYWOOD BABBLE-ON at the link below! CALGARY! EDMONTON! VANCOUVER! WINNIPEG! PRINCE GEORGE! Me &amp; @RalphGarman &amp; @JayMewes &amp; @marcbernardin are coming to see you next week! Get details &amp; tickets here: https://t.co/E6ktZU2kwD https://t.co/6h6IDYbhmE
Pic taken at a strip mall massage joint in Iowa City. Ironically, this same sentiment was also expressed in the vows @JenSchwalbach wrote for our wedding. https://t.co/sO18Ph2jCG
You don’t need a subscription, Cap’n! All the new podcasts are STILL free as fuck for the first 6 months - long before they go to @Stitcher! And if you download the episodes when they drop? Well then they’re yours to keep forever and ever! See? It doesn’t have to be over yet... https://t.co/a4nUre0ewh
Did 2 shows at the @Codfish_Hollow Barnstormers barn in Iowa yesterday! I was throwing verbal haymakers inside the most adorable venue I’ve I ever played! Thanks to everybody who came out for the shows! See some of you for BABBLE tonight at the @englert! https://t.co/qPKE3z3aBC https://t.co/sW10X2oj9V
IOWA CITY! Forget Jay - it’s Herky &amp; Silent Bob now! And we’re loitering in front of the @uiowa to remind you that I’ll be in town TOMORROW NIGHT with @RalphGarman to BABBLE at the @englert! Get tickets here: https://t.co/qPKE3z3aBC https://t.co/E79GAxnMTy
After 25 years of doing press and giving interviews, it’s surreal to now watch my kid doing the same. Thank you to @wmag for giving time and cyber ink to MY favorite actress! https://t.co/BYinURsiak
I took lots of pics with folks after the 1st show, so your “jackoff to fans” is incorrect. After show 2, I was rushing back to my hotel because I was late taking my nightly heart meds. If you were truly the folks following me, you made my meds double necessary with your stalking. https://t.co/EptVQGUOhL
Just left the 2nd Des Moines BABBLE show at @Woolysdm and got followed home. Kept driving to lose tail but they followed for 20 mins until I did some speedy maneuvers through the back streets of the ‘burbs to lose them. Was a bit unnerving but didn’t ruin a night of fun shows.
Sure was! Went again this a.m. Sat in a vibrating chair at the @Cinemark but needed no help busting nuts! @Avengers #InfinityWar is a perfect comic book movie. Plays like a Giant Sized Annual. Trippy seeing people not move during the credits. Gonna FB Live my ramblings later... https://t.co/QwtjZz1dIX
Wow! I had just moved to L.A. a few months before it opened. Did an intro for the flick there while @TellEmSteveDave intro’ed in NY. Because of Vulgar, I’d eventually make Red State and @tuskthemovie. So if you’re like “Your movies have sucked the last few years!” then blame Bry. https://t.co/RxOOTk2vqL
Momentous! On the day #InfinityWar opens, the Korean War is formally ending! Sometimes real life is better than the movies! The world can breathe a little easier this morning! So I’m off to see @Avengers again... https://t.co/7Abl2tkqeB
Hi-owa to IOWA! Tonight’s shows are sold out, true - but you can see me solo in MAQUOKETA at the @Codfish_Hollow late show on Saturday night: https://t.co/YVZTwc1VRf  Or  see me with @RalphGarman in IOWA CITY on Sunday at the @englert: https://t.co/qPKE3z3aBC https://t.co/rU4jcLvojl
Okay, DES MOINES! Where can I see @Avengers tonight? Or do I have to wait until the morning? (Spidey from @Marvel @MoPOPSeattle exhibit.) https://t.co/8GYjl6lRHV
On @Avengers Eve, I just wanna say... WAKANDA FOREVER! (And if you’re anywhere near @MoPOPSeattle, go see the magnificent @Marvel exhibit!) https://t.co/zOq4FZwatj
My Doctor ordered me to lose weight fast after my heart attack - so I did. But 32 pounds later, now that I’m out of immediate danger, my Doc wants me losing no more than 2 pounds a week. Now there’s just 18 more pounds to go. Thank you for the passive-aggressive non-support... https://t.co/idru1YK0gY
“It's everything you ever want! It's everything you ever need! And it's here right in front of you! This is where you wanna be!” Just bawled my eyes out watching @GreatestShowman again. This flick nails what it’s like to hear &amp; heed the siren’s cry to show business. I love it so! https://t.co/cqLT1WwzJ4
Okay, @elizadushku - I’m in! Your passion for this film &amp; it’s production is inspiring! Reminds me of a 23 yr old fat l’il hustler I once knew who wanted to make a movie in a convenience store 24 years ago. Wanna help Eliza make her movie? Pledge here: https://t.co/g6Zm3SfmIc https://t.co/K2TfUw1283
Happy #NationalPretzelDay! Share some with a friend. Or a foe. They’re exquisite. https://t.co/bh8Rb5W7bj
Happy 19th Anniversary to my wife-for-life @JenSchwalbach (seen here with me and our daughter at the @tribecafilmfest last night for the premiere of a movie the kid is in called #allthesesmallmoments).  Here’s my ode to Jenny: https://t.co/Nn7H0cibt4 https://t.co/iKtn30ToTH
This excerpt from the @NYDailyNews review of @Avengers #InfinityWar is a true story. I also screamed at the absolute final image before the lights came up -  a brilliant snapshot of the future. Wanna talk about this &amp; another unexpected cameo I loved but #ThanosDemandsYourSilence https://t.co/TlXjch2XRg
CANADA! I’m coming back to the Great White North! Calgary! Edmonton! Vancouver! Winnipeg! Prince George! See me BABBLE with  @RalphGarman, GET OLD with @JayMewes or do Fat Man on Batman with @marcbernardin! Get your tix here: https://t.co/E6ktZU2kwD
IOWA CITY! Don’t be so gosh-darned stubborn that you stand touching noses for a week at a time &amp; never see eye-to-eye! Go see @Avengers this weekend, then join me &amp; @RalphGarman at the @englert so we can all gush over it on an Iowan HOLLYWOOD BABBLE-ON! https://t.co/qPKE3z3aBC
I am overwhelmed. The movie is epic beyond compare. LOVED it. My legs are still shaking. It’s a gigantic @Marvel masterpiece. So much to say but I’ll stay Silent Bob til Monday so as not to slip in spoilers. Suffice to say it’s gonna be a looooong year until @Avengers 4... https://t.co/aHnsgj5MK0
Tonight I see @Avengers in NYC! Sadly, there’s an awesome #InfinityWarEvent in L.A. that I’m missing. But watching this monumental @Marvel movie in the city where Loki first attacked and Thanos is about to follow suit is gonna fit me like a glove. Or a Gauntlet. #KevinfinityWar https://t.co/lQF6B9u0T9
Oh my God, it’s glorious! I love your art, sir! The attention to detail is flattering! You instantly invoked the 90’s for me, as well as some of the greatest times of my life! I’m suddenly thirsty for free @Gatorade! https://t.co/Z3forL6h7t
Srsly? Bro, I already had a Grandma - and even she didn’t give a shit about how I dress. You wear a uniform to YOUR job, I wear a uniform to mine. Is my attire really all that baffling to a man with your credentials? I was talking about my heart, man - which you just re-broke... https://t.co/kZUJ7tAHWF
It’s me on the @TODAYshow, announcing that I’ve become a @WeightWatchers Ambassador! I feel like @Oprah or @djkhaled but in a hockey jersey! If you wanna follow my story as I try to lose 30 more pounds click here: https://t.co/PY1N6aPJAZ #wwambassador #wwfreestyle #weightwatchers https://t.co/AlRkeAFCGM
Weed. It’s what’s for breakfast. https://t.co/aFKNTCgs6A
Silent Bob indeed... https://t.co/P1lXKgsTvi
Lurking on the @TODAYshow set while folks talk about the new Royal baby. I’ll be on soon! https://t.co/qMgkZ2hLem
This l’il man stole my heart. He’s training to be a service dog so he spends a year coming to the @TODAYshow set to get comfy around people &amp; crowds. He’s gonna help a blind person when he grows up. But he’s a dead-ringer for my old pal, Mulder. Miss you, Buddy-Man! https://t.co/wivDBWO9hE
This morning, I’m at the @TODAYshow. Gonna be on at 8-ish but had to hit the bathroom first. Look how clean this place is! You could eat off the toilet seat! https://t.co/gLCMO8umG1
They ain’t lying! Around the 8 o’clock hour, I’ll be talking on the @TODAYshow! https://t.co/ZPOUQDE0mj
Thanks for coming! I had a great time at both of the @CarolinesonBway shows tonight! Thanks for selling them out! Now I’m off to bed so I can wake up early for a segment on the @TODAYshow in the morning! https://t.co/GfsI6YbPfw
Batman begins! James Shaw has more intestinal fortitude than I’ll ever know. He risked his neck to fight an armed gun man at a Tennessee @WaffleHouse and saved lives! He proves you don’t need a cape or a mask to change the world. And his quote is everything. https://t.co/rKzdHfcthz
Oh no! First off, are you okay?! Secondly, don’t worry about missing the shows: you just went through something traumatic! See me tomorrow morning instead on the @TODAYshow from the comfort of your home! I’ll be using the Babble lighter you made me in honor of you, my friend! https://t.co/GXPIklqFy6
I was flying to NYC to do 2 shows at @CarolinesonBway tonight and be on the @TODAYshow tomorrow morning. Jasmine works at the LAX Farmer’s Market. She’s a fan but she had no phone handy. I obliged and I call this photo “Clerks Too”. Turns out we WERE supposed to be there today. https://t.co/hxWIEbhm3j
For my rockin’ Saturday night, I hit a @riteaid in the Valley to purchase a backup pill caddy for all my heart medications. Was feeling like an ailing senior citizen as I walked to my car when a girl in a passing vehicle yelled “COMIC BOOK MAN! WOOOOO!” It made everything better.
Dirty secret of the podcast biz: free pods are free for everyone except the guy who’s gotta host ‘em all on his own dime/pay salaries. So thankfully @Stitcher Premium has agreed to host our @SModcastNetwork BACK catalogue! But don’t worry: new eps are still FREE for 1st 6 months! https://t.co/I4EAxEOd0C
Loved talking to you at @MoPOPSeattle, @JamesMarstersOf! You’re an angel! Well, really you’re a Spike. Regardless, I would never @runaways from you! https://t.co/xigbZ3bLZ0
Wasn’t that Steve Ditko original Spider-Man page stunning? Looked so well-preserved it could’ve been inked yesterday! If you’re near Washington state, visit @MoPOPSeattle and see the @Marvel exhibit! It’s exquisite! https://t.co/zQ1s3ZTAlp
So I wound up doing this. And I’m happy to report that the @Marvel exhibit at @MoPOPSeattle is Marvelous, Mighty, Spectacular and Sensational! (Clerks cartoon co-creator and @VeepHBO maker @DavidHMandel donated some killer original artwork pages, including the Death of Elektra!) https://t.co/ZZnU1QPplJ
Okay, SEATTLE! I have 4 hours to kill before the first show with @JayMewes at #TheNeptune tonight! Give me some suggestions of stuff I’d like to do! https://t.co/50pCs6Eak1
That’s hitting below the belt, @ScottAukerman - which, ironically, is about as high as I wear my jorts. Nevertheless, you “shants” bully this bulky boy into making some sorta Smithy’s Choice between either jeans or shorts. Mock me if you must but I will never abort the jorts! https://t.co/Q8Zsxx3ZDh
It’s always important to have a well thought-out plan! Presenting my plan for 4/20! These puppies will fuel today and TONIGHT, when @JayMewes &amp; I do 2 shows at the @stgpresents Neptune in SEATTLE! 1st show is sold out but 2nd show has some tickets left: https://t.co/UOq5iNT00m https://t.co/49tJEcQh08
ANIMAL HOUSE is the one comedy that influenced me the most - so much so that Silent Bob is essentially Bluto with less lines. And I’m in EUGENE, OREGON today where it was shot, so I went looking for Delta House to stand where Belushi once stood and where cinema history happened. https://t.co/Bza98GBrkt
Naturally, I’m wearing one of my jerseys in my driver’s license photo. So whenever I have to produce identification at the airport, 4 times out of 10, the @TSA agent will look at my license, then stare at me for a second or two before saying “You’re still wearing the same shirt.” https://t.co/uxLT6Hrch8
Just watched 9 to 5 on my @AlaskaAir flight to Oregon. Like Animal House and Fast Times, it ends with a “Where Are They Now” update pre-credits. These were some of my favorite childhood movies - and the reason why Mallrats ends with a “Where Are They Now.” https://t.co/nlgD29KK9O
OREGON! @JayMewes &amp; I embark on the Oregon Trail with a stop at the @ElsinoreTheatre in SALEM! Come see us GET OLD before your very eyes TONIGHT! https://t.co/0P75z3eqQt
On MAY 5th, join me for a Pop signing at @The_SecretStash during what we’re calling FUNKO DE MAYO! I’ll be there with the @ComicBookMenAMC putting pen to Pop from Noon to 3! https://t.co/lEFa7XypA2
In Manhattan for the day, a city that’s legendary for it’s amazing variety of food and eating options! You could dine out here every night your entire life and never have to eat at the same restaurant twice. It’s a land of food glorious food... but I’m on a diet. #FitterButBitter https://t.co/PURIBErHiX
An aspect of the Clerks story that never gets mentioned: since I was practically living at Quick Stop while we shot the flick, I had no choice but to jerk off there as well. If you’re committed to your dreams, you’ve gotta be willing to jerk off in convenience store bathrooms. https://t.co/aRjEbswgaz
You can always find a Fool and Jester like me hanging around near the backside of Queens... https://t.co/BlJss0ccUE
Giggle away the Monday’s with a heaping helping of BABBLE-ON! Hear or see @RalphGarman &amp; me and what we did Saturday night at @BreaImprov! https://t.co/oZ4wsf7Dfk
Based on the @DrewStruzan original! Classy! https://t.co/urxSV03tNC
Thank you to everybody who came out to my shows in Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, Grand Rapids and Galesburg last week! I’m finally on a plane bound for home! Thank Heavens @Delta offers my favorite show: @ComicBookMenAMC! https://t.co/1fdS83QV0B
Had a great time in Galesburg tonight! @JayMewes and I thank you for selling out both shows! If you’ll have us again, we’ll be back next year for sure! https://t.co/8yX1JYd048
When I direct a @CW_TheFlash or @TheCWSupergirl now, I always wonder how you’re going to encapsulate the episode! LOVE it! This is wonderful, @YogiWynne! I can’t wait to hang it in my office with the others! Love your art! https://t.co/y2co0eSc0o
GALESBURG! My solo show at the @GBurgOrpheum tonight is SOLD OUT but there are 6 tickets left for Jay &amp; Silent Bob Get Old at 10:30! Scoop ‘em up before they’re gone! https://t.co/nLLcKM6v61 https://t.co/L2xyQpc8aG
GRAND RAPIDS! @JayMewes &amp; I are on our way! Come see us GET OLD before your very eyes TONIGHT at @20MonroeLive! https://t.co/rspk3nn7NM
We first made eye contact while one of your fellow @TSA agents was using the back of his palms to pat down my groin in Cleveland. Even though you’re a fan, you couldn’t ask for a photo because you’re on the job. But me? I’m jobless - so I can ask YOU. And now your photo is ready! https://t.co/JEWALPGaXS
Okay, INDIANAPOLIS - I got a few hours to kill before @JayMewes &amp; I hit the stage at the @OldNatlCentre at 8! Gimme some suggestions of local stuff I might be into. (But no food/restaurant suggestions, please: I’m still trying to reduce.)
This amazing lady helped shape the American comedy landscape for decades. Mitzi Shore was, and will remain, an absolute legend. My condolences to @PaulyShore on the loss of his Mom and to the @TheComedyStore for the loss of a friend. https://t.co/slVgKMPgck

WEST COAST! You loved how well the @quietplacemovie worked without words, so enjoy THIS little bit of silent film when @JayMewes &amp; I cameo on @CW_TheFlash tonight! https://t.co/IChRH9tClY
To be fair, this non-dying fuck didn’t wanna do it. But he was asked by the @FLASHtvwriters, and he loves @CW_TheFlash, so he said yes. Then a few days later, yes - I nearly died. 😐 #TheFlash https://t.co/pwuv5kL7OA
TONIGHT! I get directing credit for the newest episode of @CW_TheFlash but in reality, the cast &amp; crew did it all - I just watched them crush! See their great work plus a cameo by me &amp; @JayMewes as a pair of chatty &amp; quiet security guards! The fun starts at 8 on @TheCW! https://t.co/BYxspRFEmA
In Motown today for the @Freep_Film_Fest so I got to hang out with the amazing @MitchAlbom at @DetroitWaterIce, trying not to succumb to temptation! All profits from this delicious endeavor go to the community, so it’s a doubly sweet affair! #watericeisnice #detroitwaterice https://t.co/peElc9U9oZ
This is heartbreaking. We love you, @TheRealStanLee. You are always welcome to come live with me - or please let us fans buy you a new place to live. We miss you, sir. https://t.co/egR7Ijv2pi

And shot by Jersey Girl DP Vilmos Zsigmond! https://t.co/mkyoRiW4XD
Dear @johnkrasinski: I just saw #AQuietPlace and LOVED it! You did a fantastic job making a classy horror flick that was inventive, well-acted and edge-of-your-seat thrilling! But there was WAY to much dialogue. Love, Silent Bob.

This morning, a @TSA agent in Phoenix said to me “I’m 37?!” That’s a line I wrote 26 years ago so it instantly put a smile on my face and made my day a little brighter.

Hoppy Easter from Jay &amp; Silent Bob! https://t.co/1tNtJ3TTHY
Listening to Peter Gabriel’s Solsbury Hill - a song I’ve heard millions of times but never knew the lyrics. Had time to look lyrics up on the plane and was stunned to discover the song weirdly plays like the story of my life - then &amp; now. Name a song that nails you. #BoomBoomBoom
Thanks to @CTVVancouver and the other networks for joining us in our mission to #SaveTheRio! And thanks to @ToyTraders &amp; @vfs &amp; @SuttonPlaceHtl for all their help! But the biggest thanks go to both audiences! You raised almost $50k by buying tickets to my goofy shows! https://t.co/6ehj9FBUks
Down 26 pounds today! Started March 8th and now 4 weeks later, I’ve lost a small child worth of weight! Doc told me to lose 50 pounds and I’m now over halfway to that goal! Ironically, this heart attack was the best thing that ever happened to my health! https://t.co/PaPD9XOFCo
It’s against policy for employees of @Disneyland to ask for pictures. So when I met some cast member fans, I asked THEM for a picture. Kids? Your photos are ready! https://t.co/Qlt2MtlDu5
Visited the space that used to be SModcastle yesterday. Happy to see the new occupants left the SMarriage signatures on the wall! Chris and Rhonda were the first couple and you can hear their SMarriage ceremony here: https://t.co/ompowykHjp https://t.co/7CjimijO4c
Been a longtime fan of @RoseanneOnABC. Best family sitcom of all time. I watched it religiously while working the counter at Quick Stop - even Season 9. Delighted to see they haven’t missed a step! Love the show so far! Sarah Gilbert’s 3rd Act scene in Ep 1 is Emmy-worthy work!
You are a credit to your parents, sir! Thanks for talking @blackveilbrides and #Batman with me &amp; @marcbernardin! https://t.co/yQ7FVHoCJn
Thanks for the memories! Was nice to be in the old place again. Quick Stop is the building that defined the first half of my career, but #SModcastle was the building that defined the second half of my career. https://t.co/scIvK08cDe
Nobody can call you “callow”! Congrats and May your marriage be full of amity! Because amity, as you know, means friendship! https://t.co/87vPoq2QNz

Not sure Chasing Amy has aged well enough to withstand scrutiny in 2018 but before you dive in, @1followernodad, please understand that it was written by a 26 year old Jersey boy in 1996 who was desperately trying to think outside of his hetero box. He’s not woke, he’s waking up. https://t.co/qJIT4xznTT

Dear @TellEmSteveDave: Look what I found in a deli on Rockaway Blvd at 5am this morning! Happy Boy Margarine still exists! I thought this was a Quick Stop only brand! We gotta get one for the glass case in @The_SecretStash! It’s part of our heritage! https://t.co/F4KovPks7J
Every night I used to work the register at Quick Stop, I’d always watch @Jeopardy. That convenience store kid’s mind would be melted if he found out he’d be a clue on the show one day. My 47 yr old mind feels the same way. Thank you for the screen cap! https://t.co/pzDsThf5q4
HOLLYWOOD! Hate the rain? Let a polite smile be your umbrella when you come see me &amp; @RalphGarman BABBLE at the @HollywoodImprov TOMORROW night! Link to tix below! https://t.co/O3TCeWLR09

I’m officially down 20 pounds as of this morning! 20 pounds in 13 days &amp; my blood pressure is amazing. How did this happen? @pennjillette &amp; his book “Presto” turned me on to @RayCronise and his program at https://t.co/ktvv6VBbub My Doc said lose 50 pounds. 20 down, 30 more to go! https://t.co/n0iuJNdLWp
Bummed beyond belief to hear you guys are closing! To me, @MeltdownComics was always the ideal comic book store - and the gold standard by which I judged my own shop. You ran such an amazing operation, @meltdown! Thank you for sharing your passion with us for the last 25 years! https://t.co/rg1RDXBTtX
Saw @readyplayerone last night &amp; been thinking about it all day. It’s pretty magical moviemaking - Spielberg reminding us all that he created the blueprint for breathtaking blockbusters. He remains the master: his Kubrick sequence is dazzling. @erniecline, you’ve made a classic!
Happy Birthday to @netheadww - the man without whom you’d never get your @SModcastNetwork shows! Will is a facilitator of dream and my Man in the Chair! https://t.co/vRJDHelPFP

“I don’t wanna kill anyone. I don’t like bullies. I don’t care where they’re from.” - Captain America: The First Avenger. https://t.co/IWSMQDYn0N
This film is why I survived my heart attack. I refuse to die til I see @Avengers. In fact, anticipation for all of these flicks might keep me alive for decades. I will accept eternity only if/when the most important Kevin in the world (Kevin Faige) is done making @Marvel movies. https://t.co/mm38mzSW5G
When I got home from the hospital a few weeks back, the fine folks at @originalmedia (my partners in making @ComicBookMenAMC) sent me a Droid Bouquet and a Last Jedi Bouquet! I had no idea this was a thing! Look at the l’il Porg! https://t.co/BdCYnqkUKO
The heart attack taught me that, like the Challengers of the Uknown, I’m living on borrowed time. But technically, we’re ALL living on borrowed time, my friend. Act accordingly. https://t.co/t3afWhaZuF
HOLLYWOOD! Come see @RalphGarman transform into singing celebrities when we BABBLE-ON this SATURDAY at the @HollywoodImprov! Al bet you have a good time! Tix here: https://t.co/0G8eQKAg1D https://t.co/274kqtKQss
Thank you to the good folks at @Degrassi for the awesome, anatomically correct Get Well jersey! I was singing your theme song on the operating table: “Whatever it takes, I know I can make it through!” The lyrics became my mantra in the moment. https://t.co/9y6629yZK8
Maybe you misunderstood: I’m not heartless, I had a heart attack. I’m no Doctor but I’m told you can’t have one of those unless you have a heart. And I may have been too fatuist to fly once, but I’ve lost a bunch of weight since then. Thanks for the well-wishes! https://t.co/SGiZRYOh9J
Had a blast, Cap’n! One of my favorite non-Scott SModcasts I ever recorded! Check out the new @bradmeltzer novel The Escape Artist: https://t.co/m5pTxXhFxJ https://t.co/qxvFHqZ55x
We’re gonna need a bigger Pop... https://t.co/uqB9J7sacv
Last night’s ep of @CW_TheFlash was a series best! Iris as a speedster was fun of course but I really connected with the ending, and the idea of how we all shine or help others in our own ways. Congrats to all but especially @candicekp, who played this episode note perfect!
Just had a blast doing another fun, freewheeling episode of #FatManOnBatman with @marcbernardin at the @SVCantina! The new ep will be up this weekend - so for now, enjoy last week’s heart attack comeback ep! https://t.co/BBCyec7Ztz
Cleaning out my office, I found a junket giveaway from JERSEY GIRL. Believe it or not, I’ve read some lovely Tweets about JG for the last few years. So I’m prepared to sign this and send it to the JG fan with the most eloquent answer to the question “Why did you like this movie?” https://t.co/BxPgtj7Crx

I honestly thought this article (or at least the headline) was written by my Mom, it’s so very sweet! Thank you, @russburlingame! You may stand alone in this love-for-Kev-Smith thing (aside, of course, from my aforementioned Mother), but that just makes you my kinda rebel! https://t.co/KeFk48IOVp
EDMONTON! CALGARY! VANCOUVER! You wouldn’t come see BABBLE in Hollywood, so @RalphGarman &amp; I are bringing the BABBLE to you! Info below! https://t.co/uQ43AHqKY0
VANCOUVER! I read on @CTVNews and @VanCourierNews that my heart attack left my @RioTheatre benefit gigs up in the air. Not at all. I’ll be at both sold out shows on March 30th! I’m not suggesting this was what they call “Fake News” - just incorrect info. Carry on. #SaveTheRio https://t.co/8qtezErpF4
I am! Because @EdumacationAndy has a funny &amp; informative show planned! Come see us at the @SVCantina TONIGHT at 8! https://t.co/tadl5gNsaC https://t.co/liHRfzaQNA

Was hard keeping this one a secret: The Grinch is back, and this time, @smosier is his boss! Congrats to my bro Scotty Mo’ on his massive gig Co-Directing this gigantic cartoon! For all those (like me) who’ve missed him on SModcast for the last year, my boy’s been making a movie! https://t.co/lBUs2Cnnh2
Greetings Generalisimo @TheRealStanLee! I’ve been trying to reach you on all the numbers I have for you but none of them work anymore. After my heart attack, you were one of the first people I wanted to see! So can I come visit you? Or do you wanna come over to podcast this week? https://t.co/41oUeS7gxe
Was dealing with my own health scare but now I’m extremely worried about my hero @TheRealStanLee. His buddy/caretaker Max has been his Alfred/Jarvis for years, taking the absolute best care of Stan. I join these comics pros in expressing concern for Stan: https://t.co/FOLlUkBbV5
In @Marvel Comics, Reed Richards invented a material made from Unstable Molecules, which allows his outfit to stretch, Torch’s to burn, Sue’s to go invisible. Maybe Bruce’s clothes too? Trivia: Unstable Molecules was also the production company name under which we made MALLRATS. https://t.co/IYLu2xwWlA
On a brand new SMODCAST! @smosier is back! Hear how giddy this makes me in Part 1 of a 2 parter! https://t.co/DCIryIfXck

Just spent the last 2 hours recording a glorious new episode of #SModcast with the one &amp; only @smosier! Now watching the @TheAcademy Awards with @JenSchwalbach, very happy that I won’t be included in this year’s “In Memoriam” montage... #oscars
This is genius and just the sight of it makes me so very happy! https://t.co/b5FbqpcpK5

Friends &amp; folks I work with have been sending thoughtful Get Well baskets since I got home. But @DisneyChannel just won the prize for funniest gift when they sent these cookies. Last week I was telling them a certain percentage of people I meet always call me @KevinJames. So... https://t.co/xtmVUkd0jy
Home again, home again, jiggety-jig! Home is where the heart is and the heart is feeling good! It’s actually getting more blood flow and oxygen than it has in a long time. So I am ALERT, to say the least! Thank you for all the kind words, folks - from Vegetarian Kev, Day 2! https://t.co/zLbwzx7Exq
After the first show this evening, I had a massive heart attack. The Doctor who saved my life told me I had 100% blockage of my LAD artery (aka “the Widow-Maker”). If I hadn’t canceled show 2 to go to the hospital, I would’ve died tonight. But for now, I’m still above ground! https://t.co/M5gSnW9E5h

When we were in pre-pro on the episode of @CW_TheFlash that I directed, I saw footage of Speedster Iris! @candicekp crushed it! She’s always been the heart of the show but now she gets to wear a mask too! https://t.co/inb1QCvakJ

How does a person ignore their sense of self preservation to do something as astonishing as this? Shielding others from harm with your one and only life is the very definition of heroism. I know I will never be as brave as Anthony Borges was that day. He’s truly a super hero. https://t.co/tWdHYvaFUK
Thanks for buying my @OriginalFunko Pop and keeping @The_SecretStash in business! https://t.co/3Ya7UEshEA
When people ask “Why do you make that stupid wide-eyed expression in all of your pics?” THIS is another reason why. Look how serious I come off in my old pics! Where’s the joy of being one of the luckiest filmmakers alive? This trench coat-wearing doofus looks stupid earnest... https://t.co/MKRkwF7cb1
KNOXVILLE! Come Tennes-see my fat ass when I yap on stage at the @bijoutheatre in MAY! Tickets on sale now! https://t.co/1ckDByqkPK
Aaron Feis put himself between bullets and students. I can’t stop thinking about this heroic act. While most of us are hardwired to run from danger there are a precious few who somehow find the courage to race at it instead, with no thought to their own personal cost. I’m in awe. https://t.co/ZNTgYZYhdt
Wanna own George Carlin’s car? His kid @kelly_carlin is auctioning it at @Bringatrailer this week! (A car is just another place for your stuff!) https://t.co/xoFV1LY3L9
Insecurity is a fictional story we tell ourselves about what we fear the world thinks of us. So since it’s made up anyway, just tell yourself a BETTER fictional story, in which everything always works out okay. If you’re gonna make shit up anyway, might as well make it positive. https://t.co/mDCSfqwlzM

The great Abraham Lincoln was born on this day in 1809. History tells us he was a storyteller, often using parables to get his point across. And he wasn’t above bathroom humor, as depicted in this scene from Spielberg’s film LINCOLN: https://t.co/USO0wPyttL
I know buying cookies from the @girlscouts every year helps to keep the organization in shape but it also shapes me too. Sadly, the shape is round... https://t.co/DcCW29O8J5

I’d co-pay as @Nick_Offerman. When I saw him at Sundance, the man was in great shape - so I imagine his deductibles are low. https://t.co/PXAlAFNhNw
Get these @OriginalFunko Pops of @The_SecretStash crew BEFORE they’re even available at the Stash! https://t.co/NP7ttZrsoy

I put all my money in a dirty envelope I stuff down my underwear, so I don’t wanna put my mouth there. Also, I can’t afford to buy the @RioTheatre: I haven’t had a hit movie in years!

To celebrate the start of our ep, @CW_TheFlash crew and I hit the @Canucks game last night! Vancouver beat the @Avalanche in OT, which was seen as a good omen for our episode! More importantly, it’s @Bell_LetsTalk Day! RT this, please! #BellLetsTalk https://t.co/XT8tNdeoTY

As a guy with more than one @fodorstravel book at home, I was tickled to see @The_SecretStash at number 3 in this article! I also found a few stores I now wanna visit too! Many thanks! https://t.co/NTzbv47z8Y

For me, Nic Cage talking about having a crush on Valley Girl costar @DeborahForeman has been one of the highlights of interviewing people for @IMDb at @sundancefest!  https://t.co/xeQy1OQcEG
If @GBerlanti needs me, I’ll be there! But let’s be honest, Mother Lodge: you folks are crushing it on @CW_Riverdale right now, so you need zero help from the guy who directed @YogaHosers. https://t.co/tpLRaVxIf1

I don’t do either. It’s just fat. Cellulite widens my calves and spreads the hairs out so it makes me look bare legged. Plus, beyond the beard, I’m not a very hirsute guy. https://t.co/dc2NpZcHkV

Force was strong with this one and it lured me to the Dank side! Thanks to the fan who placed this “laser sword” pipe in my hand as I left the stage of the Spokane BABBLE-ON show! Packed with something more potent than midichlorians, I took a hit and it was return of the red-eye! https://t.co/To3Ln8f8U6

CLERKS II is my favorite of my flicks but I feel like RED STATE is my best. @davidkleinasc shot the shit out of it and Parks, Goody, Melissa and the rest of the cast were brilliant. Proud that the flick is playing on @shudder! https://t.co/Abcd6saanp
My Mother used to hang out at @The_SecretStash online office and slip these proud Mom notes into the boxes of merch ordered by fans.

Because I fly lots, from time to time, I run into fellow travelers who remember me fondly from a flick, TV appearance or podcast. It’s usually only a momentary interaction but it always puts a spring in my step. So thanks, folks: you make the travel grind a little easier to take!

HAPPY NEW YEAR! May this be YOUR stellar year: the one you look back on decades from now and say “2018 was the year I finally ______________!” (Now just simply fill in the blank with anything that makes you feel good yet doesn’t somehow make anybody else feel bad in the process.)
The Babble Brothers wish you a Happy New Year from the roof of the @HollywoodImprov! 2018 is the year of @RalphGarman &amp; the #TheRalphReport - https://t.co/9zwJwDkAqe https://t.co/sBG19jUDq9
I took many a shit in the back bathroom of this place! And if I remember correctly, I also made a movie there once. (I try never to confuse these two actions, though I have been accused of doing so by folks who didn’t like @YogaHosers). https://t.co/8V25x0r6kn
Yelled at me from a car at a stop sign in Burbank: “Are you Kevin James?!” I call back “Not him. I’m the OTHER one.” And when he looks at me confused, I clarify by pointing at myself and saying “Leah Remini.”
Binged @blackmirror Season 4 last night and adored every episode. It’s all so deliciously dark, except for #HangTheDJ - which is the #SanJunipero of this collection. I give it 998 out of 1000 stars.

No I didn’t: the films were (and remain) merely good enough. I never aspired to greatness - but I stuck the landing on good enough-ness. If my flicks aren’t good enough for you any longer, I’m sorry. But nothing has changed: they’ve always been just good enough for me. And TO me. https://t.co/pbjzmHvUSv
UTAH! I’m headed to @sundancefest next month to interview my cinematic betters for @IMDb! But before that, @JayMewes &amp; I will be doing shows at @WiseguysUtah! If you wanna see middle-aged men yapping about nothing important, SModCo’s got the shows for you: https://t.co/vGiyBpD8G8

Disney owned Miramax in 1999. Dogma was catching heat from the Catholic League so Disney let the Weinsteins buy the movie themselves (they still personally own the film). Lionsgate released theatrically &amp; Sony did home video. But Digital didn’t EXIST yet when the deal was struck. https://t.co/69lcyWt0xL

No he didn’t: he said the Vader minute was one of the best moments in any @starwars flick. Look I love film; so I can usually find something to like in what others deem “bad movies.” But maybe take my reviews with a grain of salt: after all, I made @YogaHosers, so what do I know? https://t.co/Oh0PI6i28D

Dunno. @netheadww might have a good answer. But he also has kids - and this night belongs to family. So expect a response from Will, but maybe not right away. However, if he does respond tonight? Let’s lower the bar and call it a #ChristmasEve miracle. https://t.co/lOxP6Yv3wn
A signed @YogaHosers poster is the modern-day equivalent of coal in your stocking. You must’ve been naughty. #MerryChristmas https://t.co/j4qckEHa5Y

I don’t know how to break this to you, but I didn’t send that letter. I’ve never spoken to anyone at @TeePublic nor have I ever requested a C&amp;D be sent to you for a shirt that I’ve never seen.  So I say ignore it. Homage away! https://t.co/hI9zRNjqIT
It appears as if my Happy Holiday well-wisher deleted his #Christmas Eve Tweet that was full of Yuletide cheer. But Santa stuffed a copy in my stocking. #MerryChristmas https://t.co/HEu5vUErhn
How ironic: my Mom wrote the exact same thing in my Christmas card this year! #HappyHolidays https://t.co/3141kslNEZ
Watching the virtually-made-for-me and binge-worthy @toysthatmadeus on @netflix and in the He-Man episode, Jill Barad is interviewed about the creation of She-Ra... I think. Because I was momentarily distracted and fascinated by this chair in the background of her shot. #FengShui https://t.co/Y0tU1nacDh

My bad. I was finishing the Colorado tour in Durango Saturday night (such a great audience) and traveling home with @JayMewes yesterda. At 11amPST, I’ll jump on FB Live and say @starwars stuff about #TheLastJedi! https://t.co/yFTUNSDrsf
Just got home from the Colorado tour to find THIS bad boy! You have much more than just my consideration, @thorofficial! https://t.co/UMM1ApCknV
Just stopped by the Durango @Walmart with @JayMewes to buy &amp; donate 2 shopping carts fulla kid stuff for the @929ThePoint Stuff-the-Truck Toys-4-Tots drive. If you’re in the area and feeling the holiday spirit, pop by and drop off a toy! https://t.co/CCV6Lr2pen
DURANGO! Now this is what I call a live stream. Come see @JayMewes &amp; I end our Colorado Tour when we GET OLD in the Community Concert Hall at @FLCDurango TONIGHT at 7:30! https://t.co/iPaY7iBPwo https://t.co/iNLgpbFXBK
Going back for my second viewing of #TheLastJedi here in Durango - this time with the cinematic C-3PO to my R2-D2, @JayMewes. Might FB-Live a @starwars review afterwards for #FatmanOnBatman. https://t.co/vqubi1Xmjs
In a charming, old school 2-screen movie theater that was built before I was born to watch a @starwars movie and I’m suddenly 7 years old again. Okay, #TheLastJedi - Take me back to ‘77! https://t.co/hBqVaLwX3J
To the friendly faces of #Colorado who expressed affection for what @JayMewes &amp; I do but weren’t allowed to ask for pics: Your photos are ready! (Also: Tomorrow night we GET OLD in DURANGO, on the last stop of our CO Tour! For Tix: https://t.co/iPaY7iBPwo ) https://t.co/cu3j1iJvgp

Knew I'd like the Luke and Leia @starwars audiobooks because I've known and loved the characters for decades. I didn't think I'd enjoy #Phasma as much as those but it turned out to be a great listen that's got me psyched for #TheLastJedi (which I see on Friday!). #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/NPc9rqmoA2
The mining droids finding religion reminded me of the Aliens from Toy Story ("I have been chosen!"). But to be fair, C-3PO beat them to all that with his "Thank the Maker!"  #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/y0LjuHQXec
Wits? We talking about the same Hux who barked a bunch on StarKiller base? #Phasma would destroy Bill Weasley - physically or intellectually. They'd need the Sorting Hat to pick a hospital for him afterwards. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/SWPZlQYH4U
Finn, the soft-hearted First Order deserter, made #Phasma look bad on StarKiller Base. So it's gonna require a seismic event (like how an earthquake separated Rey &amp; Kylo at the end of #TheForceAwakens) to save Finn from #Phasma.  #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/XxFDhKocbH
There's a bunch of blade-poisoning in the #Phasma audiobook that felt like foreshadowing for #TheLastJedi. If this ends of being the case, I'll feel slightly superior to folks in the theater because the audiobook gave me inside info on @starwars they don't have! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/l3icSlKOdp
If you're curious about the silver stormtrooper, #Phasma is a must-listen @starwars audiobook! Check out a clip below. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/FGo631T3Fp
I've never been in a real fight, but does ANYONE have an internal code of honor when the adrenaline is rushing and your well-being or your life is on the line? I imagine whatever code she has disappears in the heat of battle. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/SBPKe4Gk3U
The @IMDb tells me no: https://t.co/9QL3gySl4D No Cardinal in the credits. It's not absolute proof but I'm thinking Cardinal is #Phasma book only. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/EJ2DHzTtQQ
We're talking about the audiobook #Phasma -  a book that tells the backstory of one of the most mysterious characters in the new @starwars movies. She puts the quiet storm in Stormtrooper. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/qIj5vxg0xr
He may have been predictable but #Phasma considered him a good fighter. I AM a predictable fighter: if you fight me, I predict I will lose. Hard. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/mlDiUNZb38
Only if you write it! Stellar job on #Phasma! You have a way with star words! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/NQVY82Xi8n
Whether in the #Phasma audiobook or in #TheForceAwakens, there's no indication she ever gets "the feels" as the kids say. Maybe she's got a vanity thing going with her special silver suit? Like "All stormtroopers are equal but some are more equal than others."  #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/IO0yNO9Wl5
Interesting! Hadn't thought of that. Loved your reading! It was Jim-Dale-reads-Harry-Potter good! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/AEElBno285
I think once you get into the First Order, it's all about power. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. But I don't think #Phasma will go after her own people. Smoke and Kylo are safe. But Finn? We know Round 2 is coming! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/BpDLAemYC5
Confused by my Tweets? We're talking about the new #Phasma audiobook at @audible_com. Listen to a little of it below. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/FGo631T3Fp
I hope not. I hope she stays First Order 'til the end. But technically, #Phasma already betrayed the First Order when she shut down the shields at StarKiller Base. Granted, Finn made her do it. But she could've chose to die loyal instead. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/Qh5H7GXpe3
Consider her small-world origin vs. the #Phasma we met in Force Awakens. She's in charge of a platoon of Stormtroopers! She reminds me of a Sir Richard Rich in A Man for All Seasons. Being born poor won't stop her ascendance. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/EAsB0MMjbs
Because of Phasma's First Order British accent in Force Awakens, I'd assumed she was blue blood Imperial descendent. But Phasma has a pretty metal origin: she's a tribal woman who came from a tech-less dead planet before the First Order got her. She's hardcore. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/NdLBfa3ljo
I'm incredibly lazy so having the book read TO me is right up my alley. Makes you feel like a kid again. And I love the audio mix: hearing the world come to life while the story's being read makes it like watching a movie. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/BkGXrp82Xb
My midi-clerk-ians count was a mere... convenience. Thank God Qui Gon and Obi Wan made that quick stop. (Pun mode disabled) The #AudibleStarWars chat begins RIGHT NOW! Get the #Phasma audiobook via @audible_com https://t.co/HR00wFSxm5
IN HALF AN HOUR! Join us for another #AudibleStarWars audiobook review of #Phasma! @starwars https://t.co/p0GIneZlNr

TONIGHT! In preparation for #TheLastJedi, it’s @starwars night on @ComicBookMenAMC! Visit the New Jersey galaxy far, far away - after @WalkingDead_AMC! https://t.co/OfrdFHTWu9
It DOES get so much better, Keaton! As a kid I was bullied for being a butterball. It hurt like hell. But you seem to understand that it’s THEM not you. Bullies are always deficient assholes; you are a clearly a soulful person. And that has earned you a friend (&amp; fan) over here! https://t.co/tKXcA1DtjI

Anything you get over the finish line in that one minute is yours to keep, free of charge! Like in that one “Laverne &amp; Shirley” episode! #FuckCancer https://t.co/rysx8uOG5f
Life imitates art! Thank you to the great folks at @beleavecanada for making Beleavers out of me &amp; @JayMewes! Can’t wait to lean on the wall outside your place of business and get to work! https://t.co/4rtbzovkUa https://t.co/WNF10Rkxsw
I believe in people - even the ones who seem like they’re not worth believing in. All my years as a Christian taught me to treat everyone as a potential friend instead of a possible foe. Kinda works: you wind up being right more often than you’re wrong. https://t.co/trv28De3pS

So sorry, sir! My heart goes out to everybody in Ventura and the area who lost everything in the 45,000 acres that have burned in the fires. Don't worry about #FatManOnBatman tonight - we got lotsa free tickets for you whenever you're ready. https://t.co/idis5JLrNS

For clarification: “He was born in Big Beaver” are the first words in the #WarrenZevon &amp; @MitchAlbom song “Hit Somebody” - upon which the script is based. It’s Lachute (a town in Quebec), not LaShoot. And McCracken is a name in real life. https://t.co/5A8RRuu6L2 https://t.co/DeL8SmtqC2
From Saturn Girl talking about the Legion to a defiant @MelissaBenoist telling @OdetteAnnable “You don’t scare me” this episode Reigned! Gonna be a long wait until January... https://t.co/TobUBKPxWS

Some dreams take longer than others to will into existence. And while I hope to live long enough to make them all eventually, I know I also keep adding new stuff I’d like to try all the time. But honestly? I just wanted to make Clerks. Everything else ever since has been gravy. https://t.co/gtWyeLuQa2
Dear @AmandaRantsAlot &amp; @jpalmiotti: You penciled &amp; partially inked this portrait of me &amp; a then-pregnant @JenSchwalbach at the first Stash Bash back in ‘99, mere months before my kid was born! So technically, this might be your first drawing of a “Harley Quinn”! https://t.co/Ny18JoWKdE

My heart’s with you, sir. My Dad had bad diabetes and lost some of his foot to the disease. I tried to commiserate with him before they took it off but my Father was all smiles, giggling “Now it’s gonna be real easy to stick my foot up someone’s ass.” Ever the optimist, my Dad. https://t.co/FmYZXzRGz0
Most of them took place in or around the fictional town of Shermer, Illinois. It’s why Jay &amp; Silent Bob left New Jersey in DOGMA: they went looking for Shermer. https://t.co/MAB5nyZsKm
To be fair, I’m no pioneer: I stole the idea of teasing the next flick from the James Bond movies I watched as a kid. I also stole the idea of a connected universe from comic books and John Hughes movies. Gotta see it to be it. https://t.co/bdt0AOVDEW
TONIGHT! See an army of Jays &amp; Silent Bobs invade New Jersey as @The_SecretStash enters the legendary @GWR Book on a brand new episode of @ComicBookMenAMC! https://t.co/PGmxASiu4W
Happiness is... Recording a new #SModcast with the one &amp; only @smosier! Just finished and laughed to the point of unconsciousness at an Aquaman bit! I’ll post it this week!
Headed to #Colorado for a week of shows across with the state with @JayMewes &amp; @RalphGarman starting Friday! We’re looking for a Colorado artist to do a graphic for our tour poster/shirts! Anybody got any leads?
This costume is so good, it makes me wanna see a whole slew of Dick pics! #Titans https://t.co/JjAKjHU44j
Reading a @LadyBirdMovie review and I bump into a random jab at me. It’s weird how I perceive my career so differently than how others see it. I love Chasing Amy as much as the next guy but it’s a relationship movie. There are lots of those. But there’s only one @tuskthemovie. https://t.co/rqtYbZaE27
Congrats to @bengleib on hitting 200 episodes of his podcast @LastWeekOnEarth! And congrats on scoring a massive guest, sir! https://t.co/ij5bEGEwvd

Holy. Shit. This Fat Man LOVES this Batman! https://t.co/kKuCJcUm0R
Since SModcast #385 went up, my happy place has been reading Tweets about Buddy &amp; Albertine. The pair only ever lived on my laptop until I read that script on the podcast. So seeing people Tweet about these Canadian kids makes them even more real for me. https://t.co/5A8RRuu6L2 https://t.co/ix3AvgeHe4
I look forward to the Phasma audiobook because we know NOTHING about this character. @geekgirldiva &amp; @JayMewes &amp; I will be back to talk about Phasma on 12/13 during the next #AudibleStarWars chat! https://t.co/j5C4wW1WaX
As much as I liked the LUKE audiobook, I think I liked LEIA more. Claudia Gray gave us subtle context to people &amp; places we're about to meet in #TheLastJedi.  And I didn't know how much I wanted to hear more lost Leia adventures until I listened to this book! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/v5kzmF83Bs
I appreciated the deep cut character pull and the little nod to Phantom Menace. Thought it was a wicked touch to bring back the guy who we last saw helping Padme in Episode 1 and let him go Moff diving! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/0JgSlQVIAW
I was in love with Princess Leia my entire childhood, right down to keeping a framed photo of Carrie beside my bed that I'd kiss before I went to sleep. So in my heart, Leia dated ME between Kier and Han. Can I write THAT audiobook? #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/LwXURVr8up
I have to imagine audiobook author Claudia Gray knew what she was doing when she created Kier to be kinda like a Han So-NO. But Kier would never shoot first. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/SEnxePZN7b
LET'S! We get an audiobook intro to Leia's 1st love! (!!!SPOILERS!!!) He turns out to be a a good-hearted Imperial spy who is trying to save Alderaan. But since HanSolo is the only relationship we've ever seen Leia have, the star-crossed Kier stuff was my fave! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/vO6ZaB2vuv
Maybe she's both? I may call myself a secret genius but I'm sure the rest of the world sees me as a periodically intelligent airhead. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/SbTBvsqcJs
Listen to a description of Amilyn Holdo - Leia's teenage besty - in the audiobook "Leia, Princess of Alderaan." @SaskiaAudio brings Leia, Amilyn and the whole @starwars universe to life! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/PiQf4smxaa
It was fun! The character reminds me of Luna Lovegood from the Potter books. Was a trip hearing about the young Amilyn Holdo because so far we've only seen a few images of Laura Dern from #TheLastJedi to Holdo us over. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/TfsQxGFqn5
It was a practical AND sentimental choice. That's why I love these @starwars audiobooks: they provide even more texture to the universe. I feel a little smarter going into #TheLastJedi knowing Leia has family history with #Crait. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/tikFjlnbna
Sounds like the proto-Yavin. Bail was likely looking for a base where the growing Rebellion could operate from as the Galactic Civil War was looming. As an old school @starwars fan from the 70's, I loved reading about Bail and young Leia. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/t5BIJDyOxK
The universe is vast and the heroes of @starwars have likely been to a LOT of planets we never heard about in 8 movies. So I'll forgive them for never mentioning #Crait in previous stories. It looks like a snow-less Hoth, as we see in #TheLastJedi trailers. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/0LKImnY0XV
Last time I listened to the Luke audiobook on an iPhone 6. This week, I listened to the LEIA audiobook on an iPhone X. Sounded way better - particularly the SFX. Made an already good book great! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/MPpGYikd5r
In less than 2 hours, join @geekgirldiva, @JayMewes &amp; me as we Twitter-talk about the new @starwars audiobook, “Leia: Princess of Alderaan.” #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/S01dDOggeE
After giving them 20 years of laughs loyalty &amp; his life, @kroq just shit-canned my Babble brother @RalphGarman because of budget cuts. But worse? They won’t let Ralph say WHY he’s fired on @kevinandbean today! Listen LIVE as Ralph gets K-robbed of his job: https://t.co/ARz7gxkip7 https://t.co/TSplnmiyVV
A big, fat Happy Birthday to my #FatManOnBaman cohost &amp; genius writer @marcbernardin! I’m so glad I let you into my Fat-Cave (which sounds dirtier than I meant it)! https://t.co/A4YCsYI1IR
FREE SHOW! @marcbernardin &amp; I will record #FatManOnBatman LIVE amongst the famous footprints in the @ChineseTheatres courtyard 12//7! It’s a @LiningUpNet fundraiser for @StarlightUS so bring a few bucks! (Rumor is, you could win a TV too...) https://t.co/2toMje00xt
Yes, I cry at everything. But this? This has me bawling with joy. It truly lives up to the word @Marvel! Look at that clusterfuck of heroes! Take every penny of my money! https://t.co/QfmJ8Rm98M
On THURSDAY! Join me, @geekgirldiva &amp; @JayMewes as we Twitter-talk about the new Leia audiobook in advance of the new @starwars movie, #TheLastJedi! https://t.co/S01dDOggeE
MINNEAPOLIS! This is the helpful @Clear agent who helped me get to Minnesota for my shows at the @AcmeComedyCo TONIGHT! If you’re looking for some oral, the 8pm show is sold out - but there are some tix left for the 10:30 show: https://t.co/Mb54dx13Ep ) https://t.co/92ia87ivRK
On a brand new SMODCAST, I read you one of my unproduced scripts! It sounds painful but is actually kinda interesting. If you love hockey, Canada or the beginnings of childhood best friendships that will last a lifetime, you’ll wanna HIT play... https://t.co/tmfskugCla
MINNEAPOLIS! I’m headed your way TOMORROW for two nights of Q&amp;A shows at @AcmeComedyCo! 2 of my 4 shows are already sold out, so grab your late show tix now! https://t.co/Mb54dwJsfP

Thanks to these pics, a random fuel stop at the Beverly Hills 76 has haunted me for a decade. I used to hate these images - but now they remind me that I’ve lost 95 pounds since that weird moment years back when someone photographed me getting gas. https://t.co/WkS0Xoxxfx

Bummed you didn’t like my formal jersey. But @mcbridemelissa complimented the crest after @AMCTalkingDead tonight, so I’m already flying high. Might even get buried in this juxedo one day. https://t.co/tykMkcuosF
TONIGHT! Right before @ComicBookMenAMC happens, I’ll be wasting valuable space on the @AMCTalkingDead couch! But tune in to see a way better guest: the queen of the undead and the wonder woman of the Walker world, @mcbridemelissa! https://t.co/piGkqMDTkX
Picking up milk and a fan stopped me to say “Thank you for a happy childhood.” I told him it was a mutually beneficial relationship, as folks like him have allowed me to avoid getting a real job for two decades now. Same goes to all of you. Thanks!
Happy Thanksgiving! (I threw my back out last night so I’m thankful to at least be able to stand up today.) This is the holiday exchange I shared with my Mom. https://t.co/neEcFZ7KF9
Thanks for saving me! I’m rarely anyone’s first choice, so I’m used to it. But honestly, I don’t ever need to be picked first; I’m always just happy to be picked at all. And my @OriginalFunko in any loving home is a win to me. https://t.co/63mWooZFMz

Scott would go through the script and cut pages. The first draft was 160 pages, so lots of it had to go. @smosier was great at identifying the best shit to lose. But most importantly, he believed in me. And his belief helped me believe in myself. https://t.co/odww3i6IEv
I grew up in an era before even cable TV, when The Partridge Family was already in reruns. David Cassidy's Keith was one of my favorite TV characters. He was legit funny AND he could sing. The man entertained me during my childhood and even years later:  https://t.co/678DU7qTxh
Grateful to @mrmarkmillar for the invite to play in his sandbox with my favorite of his creations! This miniseries is gonna be like @YogaHosers - only with way more decapitations and way less corny jokes about Canada! https://t.co/Iaob7ofXIB
This is my beloved Mallrats mall. Everyone please be careful out there in #EdenPrairie. #Minnesota https://t.co/eqvrWXoSr8
Thanks for jumping behind the bar with me &amp; @marcbernardin last night, sir! Love the print and looking forward to seeing you practice your other art on @runaways this week! (This ep of #FatManOnBatman - with @justiceleaguewb review - goes up today!) https://t.co/r3GOj9enxU
Hear @RalphGarman age before your very ears on a brand new Birthday BABBLE-ON! https://t.co/caf04RblD4
RIP Mel Tillis - one of my Dad's favorite country stars AND one of Dad's favorite go-to's. If you ever said something was "impossible," Dad would say "If Mel Tillis can sing like a bird even though he has a stutter, NOTHING is impossible." https://t.co/l2CFWE56jA
If I needed a reason to stay alive until at least June 15, 2018, #TheIncredibles2 just provided it. Best Fantastic Four movie ever made! And it looks like it picks up where the first one ended, with Jack still a baby. https://t.co/b0MM1o0q24
I'm trying to take Birthday Boy &amp; Batman Fan @RalphGarman to see @justiceleaguewb today so we can talk about it on his big BABBLE-ON B-Day Show TONIGHT! Get your tickets here: https://t.co/vl2Q64BAso https://t.co/w0u0QR70Yu
I love this movie so much. No bullshit: you deserve awards, sir. @BrigsbyBear is transcendent cinema and your performance is easily one of the best I've ever seen in film. You made James so real. Genius work. https://t.co/rzID5VunBx
Come help me wish @RalphGarman a Happy 19th Birthday TOMORROW at the @HollywoodImprov as we BABBLE-ON! There will be cake! https://t.co/QPTCyWQH1f
I'd be surprised if they don't mention The Tide version of the Force on that island before they get on the Falcon in Last Jedi. For a kid who grew up down the shore, I found it beautiful. And Jar-Jar WILL return one day. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/xUS4OD2cVF
I can't believe they made that story work. But the fact that it was set during the rescue of Han from Jabba's Palace certainly helped. Very "Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead". Fun story. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/XPhbXTuQI3
Maybe Last Jedi is Luke transcending Jedi and Sith and preaching a higher Force than we've ever dealt with in the movies. Beyond good and evil, into Nietzsche country. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/dvuetBM14g
I think in a world where they're making a new @starwars movie a year, we'll get live action Thrawn, live action Ahsoka and maybe even live action Bea Arthur Cantina Barmaid. Even Jaxxon! #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/O96OMPDuvR
If LAST JEDI follows this book, the Lew'el might have rubbed on Luke. In the trailer, he talks about "something bigger". Than Jedi &amp; Sith? In book, Lew'El hate the idea of manipulating the Tide/Force either way. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/jVOaAMNkFn
I loved that about Legends of Luke: he's the star of all the stories but not the narrator. Reminded me of the Batman Animated Series ep "Almost Got 'im". #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/EFGBjtWfRg
Currently chatting @starwars audiobook Legends of Luke Skywalker under the hashtag #AudibleStarWars! Come BB with us for the live chat! https://t.co/WDAej1LQLh
In the book, Luke has to fill in the gaps in his Force education himself (because the Imperials destroyed the Temple). Luke finding the Force in other systems (like the Tide) was a cool idea. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/zZItigFxEh
There was nary a mention of 'em in Legends of Luke Skywalker. Safe to say, the days of midi-chlorians may be a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/RGyVX6bDrC
Hearing R2-D2 is more fun than reading R2-D2. Would've been a lot of onomatopoeia with all the beeps. As a lazy Gen X-er, I like when someone does the beeping for me. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/BxebsY5eP8
It reminded me of listening to The Story of @starwars on a picture disc album when I was a kid. And as a guy who podcasts a lot, it was fun to listen to someone tell me a story instead. #AudibleStarWars https://t.co/T7cpT9dNhC
The #AudibleStarWars Live Tweet chat with @geekgirldiva, @JayMewes &amp; me starts at 6pmEST/3pmPST! (No midichlorian questions, please....) https://t.co/bwIYKXqjln

Stunning! Never imagined @tuskthemovie would adorn a laundry bag. Thank you to the @aussieheroquilt folks: you do incredible work! https://t.co/gNHPmTng4v
Stellar! The new @starwars looks tremendous, so giving the director of it (&amp; Looper) more movies set in a galaxy far far away is Jedi smart. https://t.co/gV9dCLeADA
IRVINE! Come see @RalphGarman transform before your very eyes when we BABBLE-ON this SUNDAY at the @IrvineImprov! https://t.co/HRof2hqE83… https://t.co/XSfAeN2wp3

Headed east for shows in DE, PA, D.C. &amp; N.Y. I try to bring my own pillow when I fly. It draws attention but it also makes sleeping easier. https://t.co/Gwukgz9Qul

Grand Canadian @CavanaghTom directed last night's fun, funny &amp; elongated ep of @CW_TheFlash, proving actors/actresses make great directors! https://t.co/HsUzjGqJFh
As great as @TheCWSupergirl was this week, @chy_leigh bringing the thunder with her Mom monologue pushed the ep into my Top 5 of the series! https://t.co/qpgcsSJgcF
Best moment of @TheCWSupergirl this week: "I...I remember all of them."  Second best moment: tying into Flight 237 from the pilot. Great ep! https://t.co/qHIlHoQutB

Me to my Mom in Florida: Fly to Jersey now! Mom: I'm staying. God will protect me. Me: You think God's gonna spare the Mom of the DOGMA guy?

I get @TheCWSupergirl crew burgers at Langley @awrestaurants every night. But my order of 50 Burgers was declined at the Alberni St A&amp;W. 😳💔😡
That's the sum total of my "directing" on @TheCWSupergirl: I wander around set looking for TimBits or a clue as to what's going on. https://t.co/2zBG9keBXf

As an awkward round kid, Flounder was the Delta I most identified with in #AnimalHouse, my fave comedy. #StephenFurst helped shape who I am. https://t.co/QuVkASw0wM

I'm a bigger fan of @SenTomCotton's earlier work... #RunForrestRun https://t.co/plTjq3Iq1D
I like the DRAGNET-like, Joe Friday patois of @SenTomCotton's rapid fire questions. He also says the word "Memo" with a delicious drawl.
The word that's been thrown around quite a bit in the #ComeyHearing: Hope. Is #JamesComey the promised New Hope? Looks more Han than Luke...
Highlight for a comedy fan: #JamesComey busted a joke about date night with his wife and brought the house down. Sensing a theme here...
Agree with @guyfromcornwall: in the movie version of the #ComeyHearing, #JamesComey should be played by the Baron of BABBLE-ON @RalphGarman! https://t.co/IhT21KqsEJ
Last time I saw @marcorubio on my TV, he was doing a routine about the future President's junk size. He did different material this time...
Testifying #JamesComey reminds me of when #DonDraper pitched the @Kodak Carousel. Aside from his use of "Lordy", he's eloquence in a suit.
Watching #ComeyHearings. @SenatorRisch just complimented the shit out of #JamesComey's writing ability. Wish Rich had reviewed @YogaHosers.
It's a crossover podcast event that starts on @TalkSaladPod and ends on the @KenLevine pod #HollywoodAndLevine! Hear us talk sitcom writing! https://t.co/EmMsVhcnei

Was told I don't make good movies now. But I never tried to make good movies: only tried to make Kevin Smith movies. Sometimes they're good.
When I was played little league, if we won a game, our parents &amp; coaches would honk their car horns the whole ride home. That still a thing?
ST LOUIS! You wanna make love to @JayMewes while folks cheer you on? Come see us GET OLD at @ThePageantSTL on 4/19: https://t.co/PCnP4bAaZR https://t.co/CduVaxttnZ

You are the truth, Lady! #Sanvers https://t.co/K0QsL8Lgdx
Yes! She SHOULD direct an episode - just so she can write herself out of the show for a week and get some vacay. That woman works too hard! https://t.co/T1uuBrB7id
Here comes a bad ass moment with the Martian Manhunter that @DavidHarewood CRUSHED!
For me it was like being invited to a banquet in geek Valhalla! I got to see WonderWoman, LoisLane &amp; Hercules make magic on @TheCWSupergirl! https://t.co/8YDqDqsC1D
You get to see the episode weeks before you'd get to see it if you were just a viewer. I "direct" @TheCWSupergirl so I can learn spoilers... https://t.co/te26GIXUG7
That was a sweet shout-out from Production Designer @tbharron. #Sanvers did their downward dogs at a place called "Yoga Hosiers." https://t.co/sdR3b2S5Op
There is more action in the first 5 mins of the 2nd episode of @TheCWSupergirl I directed (on right now) than in all of my movies combined.

School's out for summer! Directing my second episode of @TheGoldbergsABC and reliving fond (and found) memories of the last day of school! https://t.co/ol1QmunUPz
On the set of @TheGoldbergsABC season finale! The cast &amp; crew are such tremendous, hard workers, I get tremendously hard watching! Like now! https://t.co/3GaggHeJw8
Love it! But I've never been that thin. Not even at birth. https://t.co/Z9at7RJVKZ
Just did 3 'ton shows (Lexington, Covington &amp; Bloomington). Now flying home to direct my 2nd ep of @TheGoldbergsABC! Thanks @adamfgoldberg!
Don't worry about structure or rules this time. It'll give you pause, and in the pauses, creative motivation flounders. So just write! NOW! https://t.co/VSd25IZTO9
Awww, thanks! But fair warning: She's gonna wind up on a therapist's couch one day, blaming you, me and @YogaHosers. Sorry 'boot that... https://t.co/ymw6qguK0r
Your video store speakeasy is astounding, sir! Made my day to see @YogaHosers be the secret entrance lever! You're a credit to #Cincinnati! https://t.co/krVeAvFOTr

Via @GBealionare96 "why your movies on blu ray so hard to find?" If you go to @Walmart you can find @YogaHosers on sale pretty cheaply. https://t.co/BJBKuWrMsV
This is a BIG deal for me: 1 of the last photos ever taken of my Dad before he died was at @TheRyman. So we're FILMING this Nashville show! https://t.co/A2e7zyurNf

"Shall I call you #Logan, WeaponX?" "No: Wolverine!" The first cinematic mention of Logan was in #Mallrats, way back in 1995. #humblebrag
Fun Fact: @YogaHosers was shot by @jimmylaxton - same Cinematographer who shot @moonlightmov. Lax was on the stage at the end of the Oscars. https://t.co/nMZosBnc7z
Just got out of the @WolverineMovie. Every time Wolvie popped his claws to pop someone's skull I popped a boner! An enthralling artsy flick!
Ol' @YogaHosers is an acquired taste. Like a Maple Bacon donut, not everyone thinks it's a good idea. But the ones who like it eat it up... https://t.co/XKD9o9zY84
Into the blue again. Into the silent water. Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground. #SameAsItEverWas

I did! #RaveInTheRedwoods is so legit, I threw up! My @CallofDuty was fighting motion sickness. I feel like a delicate flower... https://t.co/rdLzlDt3FT
IN 30 MINUTES! Watch me play with myself when I control VG Kev in #RaveInTheRedwoods with @IW_Lee_Ross on the @InfinityWard @Twitch channel! https://t.co/tbNgqHo1px
I'm flattered. But 3 things make me directing Batman impossible: 1) Haven't spoken to Ben in years. 2) I made @YogaHosers, 3) Common sense. https://t.co/oTIhA3FtjO
HOLLYWOOD! Come BABBLE-ON w/ me &amp; @RalphGarman this FRIDAY, before I head to Vancouver for my 2nd @TheCWSupergirl! https://t.co/xWkatmTt7h
Was working on @TheGoldbergsABC &amp; #jeffgarlin suggested. I was curious if I could do it. Did it with no withdrawals. Now I just drink water. https://t.co/Yk1XlG7ntu
It stinks. Walt &amp; I got on the @nytimes Graphic Novel Best Seller List for Batman: Cacophony. In the piece, they called Walt "Mr. Flanagan." https://t.co/F9VVa11O6s
Yes - I've written all of my stuff. Only pieces I've directed which I didn't write: Reaper, Cop Out, Flash &amp; Supergirl eps &amp; The Goldbergs. https://t.co/saWpAwnP0r
And it was all downhill from there... https://t.co/gKKJgAvg8P
She used to be a carnivore but now she loves animals more: watch what happens when Harley takes me out for vegan comfort food at @Doomies. https://t.co/oP715kIct3
Rest in Peace to the actor genius #JohnHurt. Most folks know him from ALIEN but I loved him as Sir Richard Rich from A Man for All Seasons. https://t.co/DvOoftaijH
Gave up milk nearly 3 weeks ago. Got rid of sugar last year. Next to go: gluten. But if you try to touch my weed we're gonna have problems.

RIP #MaryTylerMoore - TV &amp; film star, tireless defender of animals, and scourge of diabetes. Truly she turned the world on with her smile... https://t.co/dDzB2YGoOe

Hey @DohertyShannen! It's 1995 us cast in plastic! Would it be creepy for me to take mine out of their packages so I can have them make out? https://t.co/DQsh7sjlTn
No - thank YOU for decades of Goofus &amp; Gallant - the original Jay &amp; Silent Bob! https://t.co/R4mmIGJofn
I needed a few tissues for when Barry talked to Iris in the time vault last night on @CW_TheFlash. Excellent work, @candicekp &amp; @grantgust!

My 17 year old daughter, sir... https://t.co/eYF4eH9QQz
Thanks for watching the episode of @TheCWSupergirl that I got to direct! I ship #Sanvers and #karamel all damn day! This show owns my heart!
T'was the work of the excellent cast &amp; crew who make @TheCWSupergirl every week! I just watched and stayed out of the way... https://t.co/VxA3PKxiE0
Yes. And because @ChristophrWood sold the shit out of it, we got to keep it in the episode! Dude's legit funny with great comic timing. https://t.co/2ZHr7t8JxO
I can't write like the @SupergirlStaff or the @FlashWritersRom folks. @andrewkreisberg &amp; co need no help from me with these awesome scripts. https://t.co/Sc7DvGWhoN
My only regret in this @TheCWSupergirl ep is @DavidHarewood didn't come to space with us. But he expertly delivered "Arcturus is a red sun."
The kid cried. Tons. She's a chip of the ol' block and an emotional wreck like her old man when it comes to @TheCWSupergirl! #TheFeels https://t.co/RsXrnL2RJ4
King James! It's me &amp; @MehcadBrooks, meeting on the @TheCWSupergirl before my ep, while I was shooting @CW_TheFlash. Such a good guy! https://t.co/U9DUg9WA0D
I told @chy_leigh &amp; @florianalima before this scene: "Good news is I made ChasingAmy, so I got this. The bad news is that was 20 years ago." https://t.co/LeNTIN8Fw4
Hence the title: Even without her powers, #SupergirlLives! https://t.co/8cGZbC0VVh
I turned this @JeremySimser storyboard from @TheCWSupergirl into a crest for my jersey. I wear @MelissaBenoist &amp; @chy_leigh across my chest! https://t.co/QS4xV6dWhC
Jeremy has some standout scenes in this ep of @TheCWSupergirl: one with James and one with Alex. He honored his storyline with strong work. https://t.co/mvLtCmlawj
More nepotism! (Honestly, it was pure joy working with my kid on this episode of @TheCWSupergirl.) https://t.co/3or1Gn4Q8v
Nepotism! I call nepotism! https://t.co/xCT5Sj0EpO
It was intimidating on the page, but @tbharron held my hand as we jumped through the portal(s) he built. The man's a lynchpin of this show. https://t.co/QVkwhD5xrw
It took a few takes because at first we had Melissa run at the camera. Instead, we let her exit the shot and go to Mon El as Kara "changes". https://t.co/7VDi7jtcAO
WEST COAST! We're 15 mins into the episode of @TheCWSupergirl that I got to direct! Let me and @MelissaBenoist take you to space!
Thanks for watching the episode of @TheCWSupergirl I was lucky enough to direct! I'll be Live Tweeting the west coast airing in 2 hours!
I hope so. But I know they've certainly made me a happier director - because I've had a blast on @CW_TheFlash and @TheCWSupergirl so far. https://t.co/9hMC7Yn6JH
That device (don't wanna spoil for the east coast) was created for this ep by @andrewkreisberg. It now needs to be part of @DCComics cannon! https://t.co/j936WV3txD
Yes - and I regret bringing her along because it's my damn daughter's fault that @TheCWSupergirl is even in this jam in space! Or space jam! https://t.co/TdlXiGHSTL
"START THE CAR!" was my small contribution to the script for #SupergirlLives. Still makes me laugh. Glad to hear it worked. https://t.co/rvHlOv8zEr
Then you love the @SupergirlStaff! They gave me a script full of heart, humor and heroics - @GBerlanti style! I mean, they sent me to space! https://t.co/Bx3Ktai2iJ
When I read it, I told @andrewkreisberg "This is too big for me. You're going to space!" He said "You did Dogma. You'll be fine." Love him! https://t.co/ZDKRcIZF0W
No - it was originally referenced by Winn in a line we dropped. So we stuck the reference in the campfire scene instead. @TheCWSupergirl https://t.co/h5Awu6BrJs
The Dominators (and the red sun, and lasers, and the space ship) all come courtesy of @armenvfx &amp; his team. They make @TheCWSupergirl fly! https://t.co/ihtL6jBfs5
Yes! It's under the right shoulder of her cape. @erictcarrasco &amp; I actually had this discussion on set, knowing someone would ask! It's you! https://t.co/WgS2bzFTXa
Without spoilers, the last scene in this episode that features @MelissaBenoist &amp; @ChristophrWood is a performance clinic. Loved watching it. https://t.co/r98vbIW6X4
Mark this horrible frame with the unholy writing as the moment @TheCWSupergirl jumped the shark. Or should I say, the King Shark... https://t.co/PjDUgOZ1q3
The co-writer of #SupergirlLives is the amazing @erictcarrasco. Him and I worked that @Highlights cameo into something else later on... https://t.co/6S9LkCJAyB
Not crying with joy at the end of every take. I love this shit. Seeing @TheCWSupergirl costume alone gives a guy like me the douche chills. https://t.co/O8u6nhKTpe
There's a tiny ref to my old Supes script (other than the episode title), but no Jay or Silent Bob cameos. I wanted to make @TheCWSupergirl. https://t.co/t4p2ou0I4T
There's a #Sanvers scene in the last act of the show that showcases beautiful work by @chy_leigh &amp; @florianalima. Heartbreakingly authentic. https://t.co/U2TFLJtTqG
Dr. Venture is on @TheCWSupergirl! @JamesUrbaniak guest stars on tonight's episode! I've wanted to work with him since seeing Henry Fool!
I'm proud of a line I threw in that's delivered by @ChristophrWood later in the show. But these scripts are so good, they need no help. https://t.co/jW9EEgaBch
He is a fun and funny guy. Lots of little comedic touches you see from Mon El tonight came from Chris' ideas. I think he should play FLETCH. https://t.co/9uD5lzUnil
All credit goes to DP James Liston! We went for a Batman '89 vibe. @andrewkreisberg found extra loot to add the transforming shield in post. https://t.co/NYDYvtgyn0
Van chase was made possible with the help of @TheCWSupergirl pilot director extraordinaire, @Glen__Winter who commanded 2nd unit that night! https://t.co/LDY1py744K

This is one of my favorite episodes of #whatsinthebox we've ever done! Watch how stressed I get playing Boom Boom Balloon against @JayMewes. https://t.co/QMSQ1Ho9KU
Doing more coverage of @sundancefest for @IMDb later today! But for now, this was me at my first #Sundance in 1994: https://t.co/tBD0HA7Een
Good morning, from the @IMDb Studio at @sundancefest 2017! https://t.co/YNgAolF6QJ
1) I wanted to see it. 2) I wanted to see if I could do it. 3) Nobody tried to stop me. 4) Nobody else was gonna make @tuskthemovie but me. https://t.co/LnGRHUmZSt
If you want proof that God really exists, all you need to do is look at something beautiful. Like that @WolverineMovie trailer. Holy shit...

"You guys are gonna ruin my movie career!" - Banky in Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back, to the titular stars. Naturally, I see it differently...
Never mind our differences - let's focus on what we have in common: we all hate #childhoodcancer. So does @pablove. So they're doing this... https://t.co/VxcB2xGmUB
Need a giggle this FRIDAY? Join me &amp; @RalphGarman as we BABBLE away all the bad for 90 mins and laugh like llamas! https://t.co/GbI7AQdZVu

Today, I get to direct @TheGoldbergsABC - which means I sit around watching funny people being funny! https://t.co/O7jOLHAvxc
Just said g'bye to @JayMewes for a month as he heads to London to direct his 1st feature. You can do anything if you beat your demons, kids.
I do! But along with great fans, those movies attracted some true assholes too. So I figured I'd make bad movies 'til the assholes go away. https://t.co/2ga7ukUK5M
I watched the #CarrieFisher #DebbieReynolds documentary #BrightLights on @HBO and it was just flat-out wonderful portrait of family and age.
Work? I don't think I've done any real work since #Clerks got bought. That's because show people never work: we just play for a living... https://t.co/HmCDea603K
Saturday is the night to try new things. May I suggest @YogaHosers? Now on @netflix in the U.S.! https://t.co/UPo2KZY4vV
I think "If you stop, THEN what? What's your alternative?" The alternative is a life spent wondering what might have been. So instead, I do. https://t.co/8PbnljhSSh

No, I lost the "golden boy" &amp; "indie darling" love way back in '95 when I made my second film, the critical and commercial flop #Mallrats. https://t.co/0d8nNXd6Gn
When people see your career differently than you do. Does anyone know where I can find said stock numbers he's talking about? https://t.co/83JGXkwEYo
I just backed the @MalcolmIngram documentary "SOUTHERN PRIDE" on @Kickstarter! If you've got a spare buck, join me: https://t.co/eq4Oha9hWK
I believe I remember him from @IndyPopCon. Saddened to learn of his passing. Please pass on my condolences to his friends and family for me. https://t.co/tmHld3EXrQ
TONIGHT at 10pm! Drink and giggle as you watch @RalphGarman transform into other people or listen to me gush about @LaLaLand &amp; imbibe milk! https://t.co/S8EyBuNCHg
Get smarts for 2017! Listen to @EdumacationAndy tell you brainy factoids that you can later pass off as erudition of your own! #Edumacation https://t.co/vfuNxxevVY
Script is hysterical &amp; touching, cast &amp; crew are gifted &amp; experienced. So I can't wait to watch @TheGoldbergsABC happen live in front of me! https://t.co/k7PTlLY2aT
HOLLYWOOD! Spend Friday night with me &amp; @RalphGarman as we BABBLE-ON and we will try to please you with our mouths! https://t.co/EEhvBz3wYY
This episode is soooo last year. Hear me &amp; @RalphGarman say g'bye to @carrieffisher, #GeorgeMichael and #2016 on the brand new BABBLE-ON! https://t.co/NJtIOyu2xi
33 Christmases ago, my sister made me a collage that represented 13 year old me and my interests. This is what I "looked like" back in 1983. https://t.co/XbENSGPDvc
Happy New Year! Welcome to the future! Let 2017 be the year you do that thing you've always wanted to do! Unless that thing is murder...
On the new #SModcast, hear a royal requiem for #CarrieFisher as @smosier &amp; I say Goodnight, Sweet Princess. (Warning: keep tissues nearby.) https://t.co/Yndf0PBmgA
HOLLYWOOD! BABBLE-EVE show at the Improv is sold out! But you can still read comics with me &amp; @RalphGarman at 8pm! https://t.co/x9MyWwwh0W https://t.co/OF1slV7D7q
Heartbreakingly, #DebbieReynolds passes away a day after her daughter @carrieffisher. Now rewatching her be genius in @AlbertBrooks' MOTHER. https://t.co/0DljZwjKV6
94 years ago, a god was born who'd bring us heroes that'd fuel both our imaginations and our aspirations. Happy Birthday to @TheRealStanLee! https://t.co/wkOeleVRRr
Goodnight, Sweet Princess. Thank you for so many happy memories, your heroics, your art and your friendship... https://t.co/5hBAKY3zUX https://t.co/JtuvcevpWK
The voice of #GeorgeMichael is woven into the musical fabric of my adolescence - so when I hear his songs, I feel young. Thank you, sir... https://t.co/0LyocOs8wH
Merry Christmas from @JenSchwalbach, Harley, Shecky, Louis, Madmartigan (absent) and me! (Dog-Angel tree-topper courtesy of #AlanRickman.) https://t.co/z9NVQwjR5i
Last minute grocery shopping at @bristolfarms for #Christmas breakfast tomorrow morning. The blonde is mine, the brunette is hers... https://t.co/S30Kqt7mLh
No way. This picture is a lie. It's gotta be a digitally constructed simulation. No real human could make it that far into @YogaHosers... https://t.co/OPJhhmfBBx
As long as I get to keep making my movies (and not just watching/complaining about movies) I'm cool with that. Fuck, I wish I was Uwe... https://t.co/X9uXVrz0Ag
The @CollectDST #Mallrats figures are at @ToysRUs already? We don't even have them at @The_SecretStash yet. Regardless they look tremendous! https://t.co/Vdo657FV8X

I was 23 when Clerks was bought at Sundance. I'm now 46. Next year, I'll have been @ThatKevinSmith longer than I was just a Kevin Smith... https://t.co/qn80RaA7bK
Warning: Watching @YogaHosers may lead to #MooseJaws anticipation or trepidation... https://t.co/JcORKCcVPT
"First I'm gonna make it, then I'm gonna break it 'til it falls apart." One of my favorite lyrics ever written. Reminds me of my career...
I'm 46, I've watched this movie hundreds of times... and I've NEVER put that together! Holy Sith! Mind atomized! My whole life's been a lie! https://t.co/yQ0j7XYb8z
Dante dissed #ReturnOfTheJedi as "a bunch of Muppets" in #Clerks. But really, it's a movie about how a child saves his broken Father's soul.
Marty Christmas, from Madmartigan the Rescue Dog! https://t.co/tyFGXRV95n
G'bye, #Aspen! Thanks for a great night! I'm off to #Breckenridge for my last Q&amp;A of the year! Get Breck tix here: https://t.co/PBRLA3jsei https://t.co/CiNF54WFSK
And yet other folks wrote I hit new highs with the episodes of @CW_TheFlash I directed this year. Maybe it all balances out in the end... https://t.co/Kl4GLi9zgG

Hear @RalphGarman &amp; me sing the #Christmas classic "The Little Drummer Boy" in more-or-less harmony at the start of a brand new #BABBLE! https://t.co/2rSGydwiNM
"Scow" is a great word! But considering you're talking about a @starwars movie, it might've been more topical to write "garbage compactor." https://t.co/BpNdc45vw4
TONIGHT! Tune in for the mid-season finale of @ComicBookMenAMC as the @501stLegion visits @The_SecretStash! Just in time for @RogueOneMovie!

WATCH me &amp; @marcbernardin as we WATCH the @SpiderManMovie trailer for the first time on the new #FatManOnBatman - https://t.co/pE67AFspnH
Closing shot of this @SpiderManMovie trailer is so powerful, it might balance the budget, cure disease and possibly raise the dead. Perfect! https://t.co/RR8J7MhFru
After seeing THIS amazing spot, every new @starwars movie better be as deeply moving! Christ, the un-Forced Feels... https://t.co/NWb9Zp7JU3
Was told #JonStewart stopped into @The_SecretStash yesterday to request that Iris never die on @CW_TheFlash! JStew is a #Flash watcher!!!
Tell him he's not alone: I was teased and bullied for loving nerdy stuff when I was a kid. So was Spielberg. So was Whedon. So was Raimi... https://t.co/oWfca5PLgX

Spent the weekend reading sweet Tweets from folk who watched @YogaHosers on @netflix and liked it. No doubt I've entered a mirror universe.
Last night's @ComicBookMenAMC was the @YogaHosers premiere in #RedBank! How many of you saw yourselves on TV?  https://t.co/YVVqpRvY3N
Holy shit! Just found out @YogaHosers is now on @netflix! Can't tell you how happy this makes me! Folks didn't like it but I still love it! https://t.co/qNxDpbU4pC

TONIGHT! The #HeroesVAliens crossover continues from @TheCWSupergirl on @CW_TheFlash! I read the @DCComics #Invasion when it was published!
Life is good! Every day above ground is another chance to make someone laugh. And @JayMewes &amp; I are about to shoot our @screenjunkies show! https://t.co/cfiRSjLKSY

It's the little things in life, like hearing @MelissaBenoist say "The Fortress of Solitude" on last night's @TheCWSupergirl. Loving this ep!
These are some of my Mom's Death Trading Cards (usually given out at Catholic funerals. Life comes down to a card with some numbers on it... https://t.co/LWxBniHPJd
Uh oh. Flickering Myth completely misread @THR coverage and then wrote a weirdly inaccurate story. My statement: https://t.co/Xb3N2uz6fF https://t.co/MYdlJAM771
Just learned about this lawsuit via this @THR story. I fell in love with BB BECAUSE of these men. My statement: https://t.co/Xb3N2uz6fF https://t.co/soLDb4KxaN
Loved last night's @WestworldHBO. Best reality-questioning mind-fuck to capture my imagination since The Matrix. Only request: More #Maeve!
Problem was I have forehead-garbageman-tan because I always wear a backwards baseball cap. @EmilyChristison has to paint tan away w/ makeup. https://t.co/VOCXvrnpbk

Saddened to read about the passing of America's Mom. I spent countless after school hours with her &amp; the Brady Bunch. #RIPFlorenceHenderson
HAPPY THANKSGIVING! This is a day full of murders most fowl. There may come a time when turkeys hunt humans. But not today. Today, we dine!
When I was a kid, after #Thanksgiving church, it was the parade! Not @Macys: the parade of 5 people to 1 bathroom. I often peed in the yard.
As we gather together to ask the Lord's blessing this Thanksgiving, remember to bring a turkey. @YogaHosers IS that turkey. Now on @itunes.
You deserve all the love you're getting online, as you crushed it last night! #KillerFrost is one of my favorite things I ever helped make! https://t.co/7QVNrFceMc
Happy Birthday @EdumacationAndy - the brains behind my Bratzis in @YogaHosers! Celebrate Andy with a brand new episode of #EDUMACATION! https://t.co/y9sJQBCDCQ
During the Tone Meeting with @FLASHtvwriters, I said "#snowbarry shippers are gonna LOVE #KillerFrost." #westallen fans did too. #TheFlash https://t.co/E2ZvBErFMR
Thank the speed god I've had emo eps: I can do the feels in hero world because I've treated material like this seriously since I was a kid. https://t.co/P4rVcaWhHA
Top of the show, Barry apologized to Joe (before Joe went off to interrogate an acolyte by the nose). Jesse Martin is the glue of #TheFlash! https://t.co/hpVgRLo41S
I take lots of shit for @YogaHosers but this video makes it all worth it! Many thanks, sir! See YH on @iTunesMovies: https://t.co/R867U655Ts https://t.co/BvumKV5BJG
Honored to have been given the directing credit for #KillerFrost but the cast and crew of #TheFlash did everything great. I just watched. https://t.co/Vs4wguHXrz
"...thinks friendship is more important than justice." The delivery of 'friendship' was expertly condescending. @TomFelton rules. #TheFlash
I know @candicekp has delivered a sorta You-Can-Do-It-Barry speech to @grantgust on #TheFlash before but this was my favorite. #KillerFrost https://t.co/TiRoz8iiwi
Love that pipeline scene. Both @grantgust &amp; @dpanabaker so cooly intense. Forgot to shoot insert of icicle breaking. #KillerFrost #TheFlash
Dream come true stuff. It's especially moving because it's Caitlin, a hero we've grown to love over two seasons +. #TheFlash #KillerFrost https://t.co/ziEk5YcJvl
No - it was brilliantly written by @andrewkreisberg &amp; @brookecyan &amp; expertly delivered by @CavanaghTom. I just cried. #KillerFrost #TheFlash https://t.co/cqirY8CdUR
Cisco's eye getting glassy after #KillerFrost says "I'm broken, Barry..." is everything to me. @Tha_Los brings all the feels to #TheFlash.
That was my little nod to the @Disney classic. Was tough not to make a slew of #Frozen jokes in #KillerFrost ep of #TheFlash, to be honest. https://t.co/x8FCCFji2c
Awww, thanks man! After you're done watching @CW_TheFlash, check out @YogaHosers on @iTunes or get it signed: https://t.co/Sr7SLWaSZl https://t.co/KeuORt8Ea8
Fantastic job on score, @cowonthewall! This man makes memorable music weekly for #TheFlash &amp; all the @DCComics shows on @TheCW! #KillerFrost
Learned that I don't have to be so afraid of action &amp; vfx - not when I have @armenvfx &amp; @VancouverDP riding shotgun. #TheFlash #KillerFrost https://t.co/5jfl1WuRnZ
"Like you helped your Mother?" #KillerFrost is COLD! Had to be an @andrewkreisberg line. Without AK, @GBerlanti &amp; @geoffjohns, no #TheFlash!
"You don't call a genius, the genius calls you." Brilliant ad-lib by the always amazing @CavanaghTom in the #KillerFrost ep of #TheFlash
"I need you to come with me..." I love that reveal shot with #KillerFrost. And now, @greggrunberg makes is debut on #TheFlash!
Caitlin's slide to #KillerFrost has begun! @dpanabaker delivers some series-best work on #TheFlash tonight! I was there watching her do it!
This #KillerFrost ep has WAY more action &amp; vfx than the ep I directed last season. But I was in expert hands with @VancouverDP. #TheFlash https://t.co/WGDot0OKJy
Barry is about to describe Savitar's speed. We shot on the same helipad used by @CW_Arrow once, near @CanadaPlace. #KillerFrost #TheFlash https://t.co/0yWjHrddlw
SAVITAR built by @armenvfx &amp; a crew of fine folks who make #TheFlash run every ep! Fight based on storyboards by @JeremySimser! #KillerFrost
WEST COAST! Ice to see you! It's time for the #KillerFrost episode of @CW_TheFlash that I directed! Hit me with your ?'s about #TheFlash!
Love it! We'll try to make it happen again in 90 minutes, when the WEST COAST gets to chill out with #KillerFrost on @CW_TheFlash #TheFlash https://t.co/EcuxM3NAW8
EAST COAST! Thanks for all #TheFlash #KillerFrost Live Tweet questions! WEST COAST! I'll be back to Live Tweet your airing in 2 hours! https://t.co/DovcxMsqEn
You like that? I asked to do it then worried it might be too heavy-handed. But it came from the heart of this fan of #TheFlash. #KillerFrost https://t.co/zv57cfqUGT
Thanks for your work on the episode, @brookecyan! Great job! #TheFlash #KillerFrost is almost over. But the ep ends with a BIG surprise... https://t.co/eGUoPpfJdZ
Cisco &amp; Barry gotta make up soon. This shit breaks my heart. Wanted to direct them to hug but script wouldn't let me! #TheFlash #KillerFrost
Love it! Many thanks! #TheFlash #KillerFrost https://t.co/kVCLcszFZc
Feels in this ep! Blame @andrewkreisberg &amp; folks in @FLASHtvwriters room for the words &amp; the cast for the heartbeat. #TheFlash #KillerFrost https://t.co/GYvK9gwtBx
1st cut was 11 mins too long. We mostly did line-lifts to edit down. I tried to pace it like 3 Days of the Condor. #TheFlash #KillerFrost https://t.co/Z7gJKiiU71
How great were @candicekp &amp; @grantgust in the speed lab? We all need an Iris in our lives. #TheFlash ep of #KillerFrost is almost over...
For the next 20 mins, the only crisis I wanna comment on is #KillerFrost. Lemme get lost in #TheFlash for awhile BEFORE returning to life... https://t.co/w5Bj6S15Gz
Nice! It's also on @iTunesMovies! Or buy a signed copy of @YogaHosers at @The_SecretStash online at https://t.co/D2ANVemtxq https://t.co/08Aqr45aVq
This scene in the pipeline is my favorite of the episode: Features almost all the folks on #TheFlash facing down #KillerFrost. Cast CRUSHED!
Your Dad wins the internet. Plus: always watch shows with your Dad whenever you can. It's the marrow of any relationship. #KillerFrost https://t.co/6KmS5JcyZI
Get ready for one of my favorite #WestAllen scenes of all time. In this #KillerFrost episode, everyone gets to shine. #TheFlash https://t.co/fAaWEbqsN4
SHOWDOWN! Get ready for a fight between Cisco and #KillerFrost! And add to that mix @CW_TheFlash himself! Dream come true stuff for me!
The scene at the acolyte's house is one of my favorites. It's all about tension. The actor playing scared did an amazing job. #KillerFrost
My favorite line of the ep: "Barry's real super power isn't speed; it's hope." Expertly delivered by @CavanaghTom. Love him. #KillerFrost
Right? These kids act their asses off every episode. @Tha_Los &amp; @grantgust have another pretty powerful scene coming up later. #KillerFrost https://t.co/iAmKp2lcPu
Every scene in the pipeline tonight is pretty special. The biggest @CW_TheFlash vs #KillerFrost scene happens there and the kids rocked it! https://t.co/GfoEyrFblR
Wait until her next scene! And the scene after that! @dpanabaker is on fire in this ep as she fights becoming #KillerFrost. @CW_TheFlash https://t.co/HVRXoMyy0j
I was taught by the best DP in #Canada: @VancouverDP (which sounds dirty). Kim's a master! (He also directed ep 5 this season.) #KillerFrost https://t.co/pgfb8DXbb3
I cast my @GeekingOutAMC cohost @greggrunberg! Now his character Detective Patterson gets to come back after the #KillerFrost ep!
Hallway scene with @TomFelton &amp; @dpanabaker = one of my fave moments. Love the horror-flick reveal of Caitlin by @VancouverDP! #KillerFrost
I was scared it'd look dopey. @GBerlanti wanted a BIG fight and I didn't know what I was doing. But @armenvfx splash-paged it! #KillerFrost https://t.co/FgG3d9QTzM
It's getting' COLD! Congrats, @dpanabaker! She CRUSHES in this ep! A killer monologue is coming up &amp; a fight with @CW_TheFlash! #KillerFrost
True! I thought I knew what it was like to direct an ep of @CW_TheFlash from last time, but there was little running/fighting. #KillerFrost https://t.co/Q255d6lF2H
Action-packed open of #KillerFrost conceived/storyboarded by genius @JeremySimser! I've worked w/ him on @CW_TheFlash &amp; @TheCWSupergirl too!
Behold SAVITAR! Give it up to @armenvfx and his team of weather wizards! They made King Shark, Grodd and now speed god Savitar! #KillerFrost
Tonight's episode begins with the fine folks in the @FLASHtvwriters room! If you like this episode, they started it! #KillerFrost https://t.co/V4bjvtEdoM
Wake up, @grantgust! Time to watch #KillerFrost take over tonight's episode of @CW_TheFlash (directed by the fat hack who made @YogaHosers)! https://t.co/vp3MnmpSPW

CAP: You got heart, kid. Where you from? SPIDEY: Queens. CAP: (smiles) Brooklyn. I love @CaptainAmerica #CivilWar https://t.co/ZeUmlS0Yru
"I believe this is yours, @CaptainAmerica!" @AntMan is one of the biggest &amp; best things about this movie! https://t.co/fG2n88VZrK
What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning? Best Spidey we ever had! Plus: he SOUNDS like he's from Queens. https://t.co/JssTvAPUe7

In @CaptainAmerica, like in any classic @Disney movie, someone's parent always has to die... #BambiAndTheBlackPanter https://t.co/xuCVKcBotD
In my last @CaptainAmerica Tweet, I wrote Ludlow instead of Rumlow. Have lost all geek cred. Now at Peggy funeral. Something in my eye...
On a plane watching @CaptainAmerica #CivilWar. I get douche chills when Cap says "Ludlow has a biological weapon." https://t.co/MJkjmNHWoe

So @YogaHosers is in theaters 9/2 but if you go go the @fathomevents screening on 8/30, you get a big-ass intro too! https://t.co/dYuaHDenGI
Last night, @smosier &amp; I recorded a nearly 3 hour episode of #SModcast. Opinion: Do I split it like the atom or leave it as one giant whole?
Right NOW! On my /YesThatKevinSmith @facebook page! @greggrunberg &amp; I answer your questions about @GeekingOutAMC! https://t.co/WVeIUt2Lw1
I spent the day at @DisneyLucasfilm in the @presidiosf for @GeekingOutAMC and ran into an old Mandalorian friend... https://t.co/JHfhSsbOz2

If you're not being useful in this world you're being useless. Don't be useless: try to do and create helpful stuff that makes people happy.
When folks stoop to conquer me, I simply step on their stooped backs and rise higher. So never stoop, kids. Only stoop-id people stoop.
Had no idea how much I wanted to see this movie until this trailer! Mathemagicians as @nasa heroes? Take all my $$$! https://t.co/QCSb6UdQuF

Last Son of Mars is the soul of the show, sir! Thanks for making the Martian one of the most human characters on TV! https://t.co/bssRI1Jpfx
One of my fave moments of season 1? "You saved the world. And then I saved you. With your pod." Perfectly delivered! https://t.co/yc8BYo3CTT
When you're judged by the likes of a @brian_kushner, it's time to reevaluate. Tell me how to be better, Mr. Success! https://t.co/JjATPNtpqm
Rest in Peace @starwars legend #KennyBaker - whose name I learned at age 7 because he brought #R2D2 to life. Feels like losing family...
Congrats to Bry, Walt &amp; Q at @The_SecretStash for reaching 300 eps of the @TellEmSteveDave pod! That's lotsa oral! https://t.co/P2a5O3Yoth
CALIFORNIA! Come see me &amp; @RalphGarman BABBLE the fuck out of each other TOMORROW night at the @HollywoodImprov! https://t.co/S5RjJ3XdQZ

Sweet Christmas! They figured out a way to give us the head band and bracelets too! I'm ready to receive @LukeCage! https://t.co/OAqJQDcmBB
Loved being on @StoryBots! So glad @netflix gave @JibJab a home for their kid show (that doesn't talk down to kids). https://t.co/YIkpwY29Ob
Even weirder? Ben calls street-sweeper he drives "The Batmobile" in another scene from #JerseyGirl... #nostradumdass https://t.co/biI4Z487fu
I love this &amp; need it on my wall, framed! Anyone know who the artist is? @smosier as Linus is so genius. #blockhead https://t.co/iL0WFNVxkM
I hope he doesn't commit any crimes as me - because that shit looks so convincing, I thought I might be in Indiana. https://t.co/syUsE8NN6m
On this week's brand new @GeekingOutAMC, @greggrunberg and I talk to #JJAbrams about his life as a storyteller! https://t.co/Qvk7ehRz95
Kara's crushing guilt at the end of "Falling" is a tearjerker! Red K brought out worst in @TheCWSupergirl but the best in @MelissaBenoist!
J'onn J'onzz sky-fighting a White Martian ruled but Bizarro's final scene was all the feels. Weekend-long @TheCWSupergirl binge continues...
Waked/baked to fave ep of @TheCWSupergirl: 7. Powerless Kara faces gun, Jimmy's Dad story &amp; Hank's secret origin are truly wonderful scenes.
We brought home a sweet but malnourished rescue dog today. I've named her Madmartigan but we'll see if it sticks... https://t.co/o0odJFv8jg

One of the greatest last pages of a comic ever produced is this conclusion to @Daredevil Born Again. Classic @Marvel https://t.co/Uzdt7AVJVm
Finished "Terms of Endearment" a blubbery mess. Now watching "Hoosiers". I'm pretty sure I'll use every tissue on this plane before we land.
On a plane watching Terms of Endearment. The story of Aurora &amp; Emma Greenway is one of the best representations of family love ever filmed.
Flashback Friday: When we showed @YogaHosers in New Orleans and someone HATED the movie... https://t.co/tf878tlSGt
After 22 years of a career, I can safely say the best thing I ever made is my kid. She's even better than 'Clerks'. https://t.co/LRj8DD0vge
Stay nearby! @mingchen37 or @michaelzapcic will get you in between shots (we're shooting @ComicBookMenAMC Season 6). https://t.co/EgFATDlLQv
Gonna interview #CharlieCox about @Daredevil for @GeekingOutAMC today! Any DD fans have anything they want me to ask the Man Without Fear?
Happy to be on a pod but only if you ask me nicely. You gotta sweet talk a guy like me if you wanna do oral stuff. https://t.co/A78UfGahv0
Thanks for coming! You were great (last night, in @tuskthemovie and in @YogaHosers)! Can't wait til we do #MooseJaws https://t.co/1PvvycsFho

Bummed you didn't get that the whole third act is my apology to critics, sir. It's kind of obscure, so I'll explain. https://t.co/Lysx5RjlsE
On Tuesday I turn 46. So today is the last Saturday in which I'll ever be 45. What a weird, non-momentous milestone. https://t.co/mnN0vsHnFJ

MONTREAL! Tonight is the Canadian premiere of @YogaHosers at @FantasiaFest! Please don't kick me out after you see it; I do so love it here.
Uh... @YogaHosers is a live action cartoon, not a documentary. Hoped the Nazi Bratwursts would've communicated that. https://t.co/QzApF0579W
Your (see?) Tweet begins with a misspelling, compared to Tweets by, say, @marcbernardin. So YOU'RE (see?) annoying. https://t.co/YqrYkfh2E7
NJ! NY! PA! I turn 46 on Tuesday! See it happen and then watch @YogaHosers with me at the @CountBasieThtr: https://t.co/RcvVnvaq1Y

Start your manic Monday walking like an Egyptian with a brand new BABBLE starring me &amp; @RalphGarman from @Comic_Con! https://t.co/KAVHeTxuRv

To paraphrase the movie we're taking to series: Where are we going?! @AmazonStudios! When are we going?! REAL SOON!! https://t.co/36R8U4MQiH
Looking for me at @Comic_Con? I'll be either on the @IMDb boat or these places. Full list at https://t.co/040EZPBJHN https://t.co/zZkFCKGkTZ

Aug 29 there's a @fathomevents screening that includes a Q&amp;A! Then @YogaHosers is in US theaters everywhere Sept 2! https://t.co/s8SHkvP3sG
I can see how @ComicBookMenAMC could be considered disgusting. Especially this kinda shit: https://t.co/JRsNMb1OR7 https://t.co/3PP3Efp25D
Been a Criterion title nearly 20 yrs now. It's a fairly feminist flick, considering it was made by a filthy man-boy. https://t.co/5ndViB9nJe
Director #GarryMarshall died. Amazing career. I met him back in April and got to tell him Nothing in Common was one of my favorite movies.

Via @jwlight13 "you refuse to accept criticism from fans you cease having fans" If said "fans" Tweet like you, okay. https://t.co/nTLGvdYLom
"Turned"? My Tweet is connected to this one and visible for all to read so let's ask everyone else: Did I "turn"? https://t.co/DznVY2iNZi
Uh... My post was civil and far from an "attack". Go back and read your Tweets. You're having a slight meltdown. https://t.co/na6pub61IR
Waste of YOUR time, maybe. Personally, I dig people in love. But it's a free podcast, so you get what you pay for... https://t.co/FMr7n1N4Ev

Doing a Durham Dab. Thanks for teaching me something new last night after the @YogaHosers screening, #NorthCarolina! https://t.co/1WKw8u1t9t

For a goofy kid flick that tries to be "Clueless-meets-Critters" @YogaHosers elicits some pretty varied reactions... https://t.co/uiRDpUAFjm
"Welcome to the party, pal!" And thanks for the kind words! Loved this! https://t.co/jidSKikT11
LOS ANGELES! @RalphGarman returns to the @HollywoodImprov with me by his side to BABBLE our balls off this SATURDAY: https://t.co/ay8lR92sMb
Awwww! Thanks for the kind words, @STARBURST_MAG! And thanks again to the @edfilmfest for inviting @YogaHosers! https://t.co/KiN2awRZAU
Yes! I've got 2 (sold out) shows at @ZaniesChicago tomorrow, so how about we do it Thursday at the @PodcastMovement? https://t.co/LDailXegh9
The Dark Knight becomes a Bright Knight when a little boy needs to escape from his war-torn world. Beautiful &amp; sad. https://t.co/dzfxNFMM60
The Haters show up if I breathe wrong. But the Fans show up if I breathe at all, so it all balances out in the end. https://t.co/QyYRfEBOuy
NORTH CAROLINA! Where we shot @tuskthemovie! On FRIDAY, come see the spinoff flick @YogaHosers at @carolinatheatre: https://t.co/cYz69CZrUU
Legendary DEER HUNTER and HEAVEN'S GATE director #MichaelCimino died. In 1979 he won Best Picture AND Best Director: https://t.co/S4lMpmaXb3
Like this guy, you TOO can be excited about a future with me when you come see a live show: https://t.co/x9MyWwwh0W https://t.co/B2wARWziJU
Wanna dress like an asshole who doesn't know how to dress? Pick up a BobHawks jersey at @The_SecretStash online! https://t.co/OwvwDNbEvX
No. Beauty of having a distinctive voice and working low budget is that they can't bring in someone to rewrite you. https://t.co/9cNcYtxWul
A WEEK FROM TONIGHT! The BABBLE is back! See @RalphGarman &amp; I return to the @HollywoodImprov stage to make funnies! https://t.co/tKegZ39i5J
Watching @DisneyZootopia on my flight back to #LosAngeles and trying not to bawl. So tremendous. I ship Judy &amp; Nick like a 9 yr old girl...
You play @CW_TheFlash, I played BW's The Flab. Fave moment: @justinlong ad-lib "Is that a young, bearded Han Solo?" https://t.co/AltQiPt2kJ
HAPPY CANADA DAY from the cast and crew of Canadian wannabes of our @YogaHosers movie, standing on guard for thee! https://t.co/8vKABuD1LG
So sacrilicious! Flattered! And also now mad at myself that I didn't think to do that when Harley was born... https://t.co/qKxC2oe0Ul
Loved that so! Can't wait to thank @erniecline for the shout-out when we're working on the #BuckarooBanzai series! https://t.co/OERTP3hoUl
I loved it! Got to relive the wondrous weeks with the amazing cast &amp; crew of @CW_TheFlash! Many thanks! Great watch! https://t.co/KoZ6kyMptR
Thrilled to be invited! Merci! Happy to be bringing @YogaHosers to #Canada and #Quebec (the land of Guy Lapointe)! https://t.co/5tmaGOakg9
Thanks! I'd been told it was bad and that I was stupid for making it. Same with Mallrats. And Tusk. And @YogaHosers. https://t.co/pwFxXbxzWZ
Telling a story. In any medium. That's when I feel both my absolute best and the most useful (or the least useless). https://t.co/q92JmBi6Zm
WOW! Welcome to Jersey, @hallsy04! Congrats to the @NJDevils for pouring on some Oil! https://t.co/4SAdxsuj1f
Okay, #Paris - may I request your assistance, s'il vous plaît? Can you tell me where to find the best comic book stores in your fine city?
Ate at @sketchlondon. So good! It's like having a meal inside a Kubrick film. The bathrooms are big egg-like pods. https://t.co/pLJuBYtsPU
Many thanks to you &amp; @ThePCCLondon for making it happen, my friend! And big thanks for letting us go until 4am! https://t.co/egO3iRqTNc
Denton resident Jason Lee invited me, so maybe The Once and Future Brodie can intro me for the Q&amp;A! https://t.co/ABYuk07Xvo
You're making your lady get all wet for me? That's so erotically charged... See you in 2 hours at @ThePCCLondon! https://t.co/qTqgiGecqZ
Dear @sketchlondon: I'm coming to town TONITE to host 2 sold out @YogaHosers screenings at @ThePCCLondon. Can I eat in you between my shows?
I've been traveling a bunch. Home July 1, at which time me &amp; @marcbernardin will be back to stack #FatManOnBatman's! https://t.co/HJY6zF1yLQ
G'mornin' NEW YORK! I'll be at the @92Y talking about @ComicBookMenAMC &amp; the new @AMC_TV show #GeekingOut JULY 11th: https://t.co/u9Rr3iP7zS
It's a metaphor: He's in love w/ Randal but can't admit it.(But really? His room never got dark enough to sleep in.) https://t.co/NMr1RQM28z
There was a writer named @robweiss who wrote both those episodes. If I had to guess, he's not a fan of my stuff... https://t.co/5tulGXN3WK
Welcome to the club, Tough Guy. But some of us have been sporting Jorts since the womb... https://t.co/XpnmmlGXu4
Woke up in Paris to this wonderful article! Many thanks! Headed to London TONIGHT for @YogaHosers at @ThePCCLondon! https://t.co/NXk9P24dyG
Hysterical! I love @ThePCCLondon. First they named a bathroom stall after me, now THIS! (@YogaHosers tomorrow nite!) https://t.co/9uMOEEGEsR
Only way that perfect @GameOfThrones ep could've been any more satisfying? Maybe if they also killed Hitler. And created a 3 day weekend.
Doing #WhatsInTheBox w/ @JayMewes makes me laugh hard but the funny shit the editor does makes the show way better. https://t.co/hD941eQQKz
Bonsoir, #Paris! Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? Ce soir? https://t.co/49sGY1Xu4g
WASHINGTON! I'm coming to BELLEVUE on JULY 16th for 2 shows at @TheParlorLive! Get tix here: https://t.co/ZisdzpqCke https://t.co/mWjTTf6SWe
Love this exchange. Sounds like 2 of my characters... https://t.co/XFSzgqgt5G
Thanks! And I used your pic of me &amp; Harley for my @instagram pic today, so thanks for that too! https://t.co/5wo96H5qhf
Apologies to the @edfilmfest folks waiting to see Wilderpeople while I was droning on in a @YogaHosers Q&amp;A! My bad! https://t.co/0zYrNib1yr
Ask Harley if having her Dad cast her in a movie like @YogaHosers is tantamount to some kinda child abuse. #Nepotism https://t.co/qqp5KiMIS9
Thanks for the time! Doing press with my kid is something I never imagined I'd ever do in my life, so it was fun! https://t.co/ZqJhEH3N8c
Hear @smosier and I discuss @GameOfThrones and the origins of Father's and Mother's Days on the brand new #SModcast! https://t.co/17DdGZ0Kyu
The thing I find insanely endearing about #Edinburgh: I've never been called "a fucking legend" by passerby more in my life. #humblebrag
The only thing scary about @YogaHosers is that it was somehow made at all. The flick's like CLUELESS meets CRITTERS. https://t.co/u1GrDgXtmR
Great news! LiveStreaming @YouTube will make #FatManOnBatman an almost daily show! Instant updates on breaking news! https://t.co/L2Kuzev1XL
Who knew I'd be in the UK as history was made? We drove past many polling places yesterday, all packed with voters. https://t.co/HsuteIhVjB
No worries: we added a midnight screening of @YogaHosers at @ThePCCLondon same night! Tix: https://t.co/BdagsJG1GB https://t.co/GPUPuuVlDG
If I shot this scene today, the bag holding all of Banky's porn would be a smart phone (which didn't exist then). https://t.co/YGzk2nSEPJ
Gather your guts! You didn't miss @YogaHosers at @ThePCCLondon: we added a midnight showing: https://t.co/BdagsJG1GB https://t.co/aN5tIxacpd
8bit @YogaHosers! The movie is an ode to 80's schlock flicks so an 80's-ish looking game would make so much sense! https://t.co/hA404wBGhw
The @YogaHosers premiere at @ThePCCLondon SOLD OUT so fast that we a added a witching hour screening at MIDNIGHT!!! https://t.co/8GLJkTAttd
No, I will not do a 2nd night... But I will do a 2nd screening! Adding a @YogaHosers late show at @ThePCCLondon now! https://t.co/ZL4LH0BrVq
That's me 10 years ago? I look old enough to be my own Father. Think I may be aging in reverse. #BenjaminButtonBitch https://t.co/LBtYmHasTk
LONDON! Look for news today about a @YogaHosers screening TUESDAY in town, likely where I'm known to watch ladies in the loo (and men too)!
Damn - I was hoping for number 69. Nootch... #walrusyes forever. https://t.co/6EezmRKwY2
Thanks! But the way I understand it, like male pattern baldness, the asshole gene skips a generation. So she's safe. https://t.co/XvDJ18Ry0L
Last night, at @edinburghcastle for the @edfilmfest, I tipped the Quaich! They say to tip 15% but I tip 50% minimum. https://t.co/Ey8NQFsg9p
Honored to be part of the ceremony! Thanks to @FionaHyslop &amp; the @edfilmfest! @YogaHosers is happening to #Scotland! https://t.co/SKyGlRBUs6
The @YogaHosers trailer has been called many things. "Smart" hasn't been one of them. "BatShit stupid" is said lots: https://t.co/N4SFvtfMek
Flying to @edfilmfest today to show @YogaHosers! Also doing intro/Q&amp;A for @holidays_movie and a Batman'66 screening! https://t.co/9ybuD5eiVm
VANCOUVER! Central City stand-in on @CW_TheFlash! I'm headed your way in November to A all your Q's at @FANEXPOVAN! https://t.co/uigjZaprqR
In my work? Yes (I did make @tuskthemovie &amp; @YogaHosers). Biologically? Not at all. You're thinking of @RalphGarman. https://t.co/KStclC4YDj
Thanks! Means a lot coming from the best girlfriend a #LastStarfighter could ask for... #KodanArmada https://t.co/IIWwDZete6
Tuned into @GameOfThrones tonight for the #BattleOfTheBastards but got the most metal 70's album cover of all time instead! Fuck! #Dracarys
Anton Yelchin just died in a car wreck. So damn sad. I met him and his Mom on a plane once. They were very sweet. https://t.co/OtkoO4HisG
Love this AND the @YogaHosers print! Thanks for making our art part of your art @Pernilleoe! Wanna do a comic w/ me? https://t.co/d5Nto3rFO7
Landis the Younger! You're invited to the Fat Cave in July to tell tales of cinematic photoplays on #FatManOnBatman! https://t.co/nBuqYWaeT4
Your kid made my kid's night - and mine too! She is exactly who we made @YogaHosers for! So glad she dug it! https://t.co/0LJbf3J2rU
At 8:15, @YogaHosers is gonna happen to all these good folks attending @IndyPopCon! I suggest you pray for them... https://t.co/TnBpXBy2Y1

INDIANA! I show @YogaHosers to all of you Yoga Hoosiers and then do #FatManOnBatman Live TONIGHT at @IndyPopCon! https://t.co/2Hvct2u6Eq
We're doing #FatManOnBatman LIVE tonight after my @YogaHosers screening at @IndyPopCon! What topics should we cover? https://t.co/FeCcgtQOS7
7 years ago today, I sold out @carnegiehall! And my #FatManOnBatman boyfriend @marcbernardin wrote about it in @EW: https://t.co/KBkpXmCOUo
Wound up eating #PDX breakfast at @pinest8biscuits. They tried to kill me with an amazing array of oral delights... https://t.co/5t6USk7ohP

QUEBEC! I'm bringing my @YogaHosers movie up north, beyond the wall, to #Montreal! Come see YoHo's Canadian debut! https://t.co/33MWunzQLw
G'morning, #Portland! Where does a hungry tourist get a good breakfast if he's using all his will power to stay away from @VoodooDoughnut?
It's almost 15 years old! Thanks for seeing it and bigger thanks for keeping it all this time! https://t.co/Q1fCQjMPWL
INDIANAPOLIS! Not only am I coming to @IndyPopCon w/ @YogaHosers &amp; Fat Man... I finally made the cover of @NUVO_net! https://t.co/Nb6cRbgVKP
Thanks to the good folks at @AMC_TV we start shooting @ComicBookMenAMC Season 6 this month! Wanna be on it with us? https://t.co/wBLrxNfJd9
"O, Canada" sang in both English &amp; French (like a Canadian hockey game) by the @YogaHosers: https://t.co/AYgmrQFHBS https://t.co/i4vlDoPi7V
Watching @GameOfThrones makes me appreciate my life: as bad as it can get in our world some days, at least there aren't any WhiteWalkers.
On @periscopetv! https://t.co/9feB3N9NVr
If you're in NYC &amp; into bears, me &amp; @screenjunkies superstar @andysignore are gonna be on stage together. Shirtless. https://t.co/PAZxBHbRZD

Hear the @GlamSkanks blistering cover of #TheHockeySong on the @YogaHosers Soundtrack! Listen to it on @AppleMusic: https://t.co/jwtTJ31qT1
They were people like you &amp; me who just wanted to go out on a Saturday night and have a good time. Heartbreaking... https://t.co/xRGJDJ8OUO
COLUMBUS! Today's the day! @YogaHosers comes to @Studio35 for 2 sold out shows! I can't wait to show you my wieners! https://t.co/M0wu3rSorL

Lots of #Mallrats talk TONIGHT at 7:30 at @thetrocadero when @RalphGarman &amp; i BABBLE-ON: https://t.co/Hc5V6ONu4j https://t.co/8aLqeVTGW4
Saturday mornings were always the highlight of my week in childhood - so much so that I shaped my adulthood to be one long Saturday morning.
Thanks to @CW_TheFlash, I've started setting up shop in scripted TV! First up: #BuckarooBanzai. Next up, #Mallrats!  https://t.co/G4Nc4GqcXl
MGMtv &amp; I pitched #BuckarooBanzai yesterday. The result? 3 serious suitors! So looks like WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING THE SHOW! AHHHH! #TeamBanzai
