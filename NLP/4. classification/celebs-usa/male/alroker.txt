I’m going to say this one last time, but the folks who get it, understand and the ones who DON’T, won’t. I can be Doc Brown, and I wear the outfit and wig and not change my skin color if you’re white , you can be President Obama if you want. Just don’t color your skin!

Dude, didn’t see that movie. But let me jump in the DeLorean with Doc Brown and travel to 2004 to denounce it. https://t.co/v740Rd750k
Ted Danson. 1993. Wrote a letter to the Friars Club. Jimmy Kimmel 2000. Never saw it til last week. Ditto, Jimmy Fallon and Sarah Silverman. Of course, it makes me cringe. Horrible. And do I think wish they never did it? You bet. But I don’t have a time machine

All those degrees and such a limited vocabulary. https://t.co/JcsSSLFJi9
I appreciate that. It was a ooor attempt at humor and believe me, it made me think about how words hurt and have tried to keep that filter in place. https://t.co/xTY6ubF7nQ
Of course I apologized. Immediately. It was wrong. Plain and simple and took responsibility for it. https://t.co/xOY4gyobqr
The original Amos and Andy, Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden in a composite publicity photo https://t.co/uqd5dKxyoX
From 1931 to 1960, Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden, two white men, wrote and acted in films and on radio as Amos and Andy. The two men you mentioned were actors on the tv show, but Correll and Gosden did the pilot. https://t.co/bbFcQlUOOR
Ok, so you want to equate a few example of a black guy playing a white guy to literally thousands of examples of black face and minstrel shows on film/tv and countless Halloween/fraternity/sorority parties? https://t.co/FA8cUELegc
Stop right now. The two are completely different https://t.co/naaatsPHT4
Playing a dead guy. My skin is green. Stop trying to equate. Playing A dead green guy does not have the historical significance and pain attached to blackface and minstrel shows. The idea that you try to link the two speaks to your ignorance https://t.co/ZUCQgpRDXY

167 years. This is not cyclical https://t.co/ci9vfsrfF9
Michael is so strong, it could stay a tropical storm til exiting the Mid-Atlantic coast Friday morning https://t.co/ZfBqFJlDhs
This is unfortunately becoming the norm; rapidly intensifying storms. Another by product of #climatechange Wamer ocean waters and more moisture in the atmosphere https://t.co/vRoAgaqqDM
In fairness to @realDonaldTrump the winds around Michael are the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado that is 5-10 miles wide https://t.co/8bYjQJqsYH

While on hold with @DHLUS They’re playing a MUZAK version of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” and an announcer telling me, “There isn’t any mountain high enough to get your package to you”. Uh-oh. Must’ve hit a mountain they didn’t know about.
Hahaha https://t.co/lvNz1JWMSV

Our #noreaster #2018 has achieved #bombogenesis with a pressure drop of an impressive 43 millibars, from 1011 to 968, in the past 24 hours.  It’s considered a "bomb" if it drops 24 MB in 24 hrs. Probably will continue to drop into the low 950s.
Watching this rapidly intensifying #noreaster heading up the #EastCoast tonight into tomorrow. 41 million under #winter #weather advisories. Details on @MSNBC and on @NBCNightlyNews https://t.co/jzwtTRzSRv

Has there ever been anything crazier than that #BestPicture mistake in the history of the @Oscars2017_Live
Whoo hoo. Jetbridge is moving. Huzzag!!
The perfect end to our @Delta flight: we've landed 2.5 hours late and there's a problem with the #jetbridge at @LGAairport
And awaaaaay!!!!
One way or another, I was getting back fro tomorrow am's @TODAYshow for the return of @SavannahGuthrie https://t.co/KfcvlcwoY7
Alrighty!! On the flight!!
You're right. Getting loaded right now. Barkeep... https://t.co/Y4QPSdvqfL
You have a great day https://t.co/rsLLyyN2mU
Yep. Reason was a mechanical issue at 9:30am. It's now 6:18 https://t.co/t5DW9muiHH
Just disappointed that we're gonna miss @Oscars2017_Live and @NMoralesNBC on the #redcarpet and @jimmykimmel
Pure poetry https://t.co/x40yFokdLm
You are absolutely correct https://t.co/UiKNjuKg4s
Hey now! A @Delta gate agent just came rushing by. This folks on the plane will be released from their captivity
Mechanical issues they knew about at 9:30 this am https://t.co/G5LTuHVPuL
C'mon, @Delta Is it a surprise this flight is coming in? So the folks delayed at @LGAairport for 3 hours have to wait. Unbelievable
Here's the icing on the cake. Our @Delta plane just arrived at the gate, 3 hrs. late. There are no gate agents to move the jet bridge
Ummmm. I've never bashed @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9u5gbwNqjm
As I said, not the worst thing in the world. Just frustrated https://t.co/pd6eRwJjFM
Sadly only flight options are tomorrow. I checked https://t.co/PHoIMIcE1y
Here's what's frustrating about @Delta They say our flight is boarding at 5:50, leaving at 6:30. Look at the incoming flt. No way https://t.co/d2QwN6NV69
You're confusing me with @TheRevAl Yes, we're both black, thinner, handsome and passionate about our causes. Him: politics. Me:Weather https://t.co/WXnDLk89Fz
There are far worse things being stuck in an airport. I'll get caught up on @ThisIsUsNBC @NBCBlacklist and @RedemptionNBC
No idea what you're talking about https://t.co/WXnDLk89Fz
And there are worse things, I know. Was hoping to be home in time for the @Oscars2017_Live . Hey, @jimmykimmel can you slow things down?
It would seem @Delta could use a little flexibility. But they did let us know ahead of time. But you still need to be @ airport on time
I mean, @Delta couldn't use the @LGAairport flight that lands at 4:30pm for our flight then use our original equipment for the next flt out?
Have a 3:30pm @Delta flight. Got a text at 9:30am it's delayed til 6:30pm. The incoming flt from @LGAairport had trouble. No other planes?
Yaaay!!!!!! This is great news. @SavannahGuthrie I'm welcoming you back with an extended version of Bang On The Drum All Day https://t.co/poQYa7m3P7

Valid point. https://t.co/L0oviMo4Md
@SteffeyAllison And my kids were so hungry, bottles vanished pretty quickly.
@SteffeyAllison Maybe because being able to feed my kids a bottle of her breast milk gave me a connection to them both, I cherished it
@SteffeyAllison Moms, including my wife, did and do the bulk of the feeding and else. If it makes your life easier, God bless.
No offense but how are you on the couch feeding your baby for hours? And how about an audiobook? https://t.co/XKJQ68SRPS
