The offense only scores 13 points and they give MVP to Edelman but the D only gave up 3 points and Gilmore had forced a fumble, a int, 3 PBUs and 5 Tackles!?! Smh no respect for the masterpiece on Defense!

@Marcus_Mosher Yeah OU was the truth that year. Crazy to think that was over 10 years ago. I’m curious what the scouts say now about me.
@Marcus_Mosher I do...I remember I got a sack (half sack) on Sam Bradford. I remember making a few big time tackles against a young DeMarco Murray. Going up against Phil Loadholt and Jermaine Greshman. They took over late in the 3rd with PA bombs that made me think Sam was the next great QB

@COLINMcCARTHY52 naw I'm in DC in for some charity stuff...but I like both teams man...can't be mad either way but I betted on OKC
My man @russwest44 has to get off today...he needs to drop 30 for @okcthunder to win and stay alive in the #nbafinals tonight
I like the heat but they wont win it in miami #okc is too tough RT @COLINMcCARTHY52:  this guy... Come on Fam. You know the Heat got this
@morgancantrell oh yeah I can't wait to whip up on your 9ers man
Not gonna happen RT @COLINMcCARTHY52: I will say it again.... Heat closing out the series in South Beach!!!!! Lets Go Heat!!!!! Get that W
I love that movie RT @johnskelton19: Just finished watching "For Love of the Game" such a good story.

Statue of liberty #chillin http://t.co/ATV629EX
What should I do in NYC? Any suggestions?
You have to buy a Kevin Durant jersey RT @ImOnlyOneMan: @Campbell93 name your terms man
@ImOnlyOneMan the thunder don't lose win they score over 105! That's the golden number
@ImOnlyOneMan what do I get in return if we are betting?
@ImOnlyOneMan  tell me why OKC played terrible all game and still had a chance to win...OKC wins this series in 6 at the longest might be 5
That goaltending call that really wasn't is the difference in this game
Can Durant get a foul call? They have been calling it for Lebron all game
Why does Lebron take that shot? That's not his game! But since I'm going for OKC thank you
This is the best wade and Lebron have played together throughout the #playoffs and #nbafinals
I love that jordan Gatorade commercial #winfromwithin that's what the #nbafinals are all about
Now this is a game! Let's go!!!! Hope it comes down to the very last shot! I'm loving this
Kevin Durant alway shows up in the forth! Especially in the #nbafinals but being in foul trouble will hurt how aggressive he can be
The way the refs are calling this game you would think the game was in Miami
@okcthunder needs a run to make this a game at the end! This is what the #nbafinals are all about
When did Shane Battier become an all star #nbafinals MVP type player! This is crazy
@okcthunder could use me on the court right now...I could be a bosh neutralizer cuz he is killing! At least get some hard fouls #nbafinals
Thank you I was frustrated lol RT @MissKimmy99: Its GOAL-Tending...Im sorry...I had to...lol “@Campbell93 How is that goldtending?”
I want to win a championship! That's what I meant to say RT @mrrsh418: @Campbell93 You want to play for a championship AGAIN.
@MrDanWilliams man that wasn't a foul either
He will in my opinion! He is the best player out there RT @robbart: @Campbell93 @TwitterSports Amazing if Druant wins a title before LeBron.
Lets make it happen RT @gmoneyAZ2: @Campbell93 dont worry bro this yr the #birdgang will go the superbowl!!!
How is that goldtending?
Man I want to play for a championship! That city is rocking right now! The atmosphere is crazy! #nbafinals nothing like it this time of yr
The @miamiheat are owning this game right now...they are starting to look like they belong here! Harden is carrying @okcthunder on his back
The nuggets are my # 1 team RT @CGSportsView: @Campbell93 how many teams do you like? LOL you were a Nuggets fan last time :-)
I love miami and everything about it RT @Zack_UM: @Campbell93 cmon man, you can't pick them when you played for us in Miami #TheU
Wow Durant in foul trouble is scary Westbrook really has to be that star he wants to be tonight! Basketball is a game of runs so OKC needs 1
I like both teams but im taking OKC to win it all RT @CGSportsView: @Campbell93 who you got?
The beard enters the game watch out now @okcthunder let's see if they can get something started #nbafinals
The @miamiheat are off to a fast start! Wow they look good...but they did last game too! #letsgo #nbafinals
I'll be live tweeting during the #nbafinals tonight with @twittersports. Is it gonna be @miamiheat or @okcthunder? Tell me what you think!

Okay now let's go #OKC
winnin the judges ovr RT @darrenrovell: I'm sorry but Lena Greenberg's act is getting old. She's shocked every time she gets the word right.
Yessir..I can find good in pretty much every situation or at least I try too RT @RayGarcia30: @Campbell93 glass half full kinda guy. NICE!!!
I could probably make steak and eggs RT @Ash_StylePHX: @Campbell93 LMAO.....or how you can cook an egg on the cement. Easy breakfast haha
Nope oatmeal raisin RT @theAdamGreen: @Campbell93 Must not be chocolate chip.
The best thing about the AZ heat is how hot and soft a #cookie gets when you leave it in the car for a couple mins
@68INCOGNITO haha you are a beast...but they only asked me my top 20 so there wasn't too many Olineman on there
Yessir RT @T_the_Punter: @68INCOGNITO @campbell93 All im saying is i'm happy with having more former canes than any other school #GoCanes
I voted last yr but not this yrRT @68INCOGNITO: @T_the_Punter Do players even vote on this.  No one from the dolphins has ever voted?? 👎👎
@NicholasPepe thanks...hopefully I will be better this year
They do...just dont put it on the NFL network RT @T_the_Punter: @Campbell93 honestly the list is stupid. Experts should do it
Time to watch the #NFLTOP100
This is embarrassing for #okc they didn't come to play today

Thats funny RT @azartdirector: BREAKING: 49ers QB Alex Smith ponders retirement after @AZCardinals sign @Campbell93 to new 5 year contract.
Why do the #heat only have 52 points in the 4th quarter
Where was the #offense before this last couple mins in the 4th? Both the #76ers and #celtics are hot right now
@LarryFitzgerald what's your handicap? Do you think I can hang with you? Lol
No faith? I'm getting better RT @Hardkore_3: @Campbell93 @jayfeely I'm gonna say no unless you are secretly getting tutored by Tiger himself
So who thinks I can out golf @jayfeely at the #cardsgolf event? He is supposedly the best golfer on the team
These refs suck

Linless Knicks = winless Knicks
Haha I could probably make the Knicks better RT @daTalleyman: @Campbell93 right they might as well have u out there speaking of non scorers
No chance without Rose, sorry lol love the confidence tho RT @Stanastew2: @Campbell93 slow Down Calais! Don't count my Bulls out just yet
#prediction heat vs. thunder in the championship and #okc takes it home
Game over...it was a good game thru 3 but the Knicks don't have enough scorers

Haha glad you think so RT @ReeceMoyes: @Campbell93 if that was you it would have been a pick ;)
Pierre-Paul is a beast...I respect his game...he does it all...way more than just a sack master
I picked the giants to win and it's looking good so far
I know intentional grounding in the endzone is a safety but I didn't know if you threw it deep that was a penalty
I didn't know that was a safety...crazy I've played football my whole life and never knew that

That's just youth showed by Ortiz...but he said he would give him a rematch so I'm cool...they should fight again
Ortiz has to know the fight is still going...if it was an illegal hit why would the ref start counting as if it was a knockout?
If the Def blows a coverage and a WR is wide open..the QB is gonna throw him the ball...the round was still going...mayweather kept fighting
Wow this is crazy...I guess you always gotta keep your head up...protect yourself at all times...you've seen million dollar baby
Ortiz grew up in Denver right around the corner from me...but still gotta ride with mayweather tonight but its tough to go against home town

@JSShields haha frustration makes us all say dumb things...but I'm sure he meant that differently than it came out
@fernandaize man that's part of the mind set you need to win a champ...confidence is key...you have to believe you can win or you won't
@KidStallyn he wanted a chance to win a champ and didn't think he could in Clev...Shaq is love! He played for 5 teams...so can u blame him?
@KidStallyn he didn't sell his soul for a ring. Its professional sports! we get traded, cut, and sometimes we reach the end of our contracts
Why is everyone hating on Lebron James? He just lost the NBA #Finals...don't you have any sympathy for him at all? Give the man a break

Jordan said to Shaq "Before you can learn to succeed you must learn to fail"
How do you not use your foul to give in that situation
Dirk is a beast....but its gonna be a long series
"@ImOnlyOneMan: @Campbell93 My phone died! You were right, Dirk is heating up!!!" This game is crazy
This is a chance for Lebron to prove he is on Jordan level....and Chamers is a beast
Wow really
I'm really nervous right now
The reporter just asked wade what is trying to achieve out there? lol really....it seemed simple to me...he is trying to win #duh

"@JennRibero: @Campbell93 yaa, wish i can say the same C" it starts with your mind set and attitude

@HamzaAbdullah21 really tho? a new PA announcer? Lol you crazy man
"@HamzaAbdullah21: @Campbell93 @kerryrhodes one player away??? More like one player, one coach, 2 trainers and a new PA announcer" lol
"@kerryrhodes: @Campbell93 it didn't help denver lol" We got whipped so I can't say much about that..but were one player away from greatness
@HamzaAbdullah21 I do like a lot of teams but I know one thing for sure....I hate the Lakers and I really don't like the spurs either lol
Whole foods for lunch after an intense workout
"@kerryrhodes: Dallas wats going on this weekend there? Ill be in the building!" Going to the game aint gonna help the mavs win homie
My good cleats are locked up in the facility...I had to buy some new ones and break them in...I feel @ochocinco 's pain

Do you guys really think Lebron James better than Jordan? Let's be serious...MJ the best to ever play the game point blank period
Let's go heat! Bring on the mavs
He wants it...and all those that doubted him can now hop back on the bandwagon cuz he is proving he is clutch in the games that matter
You can't tell me Lebron James doesn't want it right now
Can't win if you miss your free throws
These refs are suspect...but I'm glad they are letting them play for the most part...let's go heat
"@heathero14: @Campbell93 looks like our teams will be facin each other...... &gt;:)" your going down just like in 2006
Rematch of the 2006 finals
OKC can't finish...just inexperience...if they can keep the team together they will be good for a lot of years to come
Westbrook is grabbing big boards but he can't turn the ball over
James Hardin is ballin

"@PierreGarcon85: Vegas or back to Indy?" Let me know if you in vegas
@marlodenege went to vegas for a friends bday
@DodggerDodge yeah its gorgeous out....but earthquakes would be torture so I don't think we would go out like that
@JODY_EVANS haha yeah def no holes in one...I'm not that good
If the world ends today imma go out swinging http://yfrog.com/h7pojslj
Charity golf tournament...let's get it in
In the airport in albuquerque and literally just saw a guy with pink hair #interesting
@missfeb06 hey what's up? Just got to NM
Exhausted...workout was so serious today...especially the so called "running" part...I hate pushing sleds
Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, and today's a gift! That's why they call it the present
Okay now the Heat are ballin! Just gotta finished
The Heat have to knock down open shots or this will be a short series
@luvnumber90 I will come in next week

"@luvnumber90: @Campbell93 speakin of respect, BOY do those kids in Miss Z's class respect u!!!" I'm gonna come see them...I promise
Oh and Rondo is one of the toughest guys in the game...I respect him a lot...hope he plays well today even tho I'm going for the heat
"@KCBrackley: @Campbell93 odom was intentional" I don't think he was trying to hurt him...just a little frustration
@chrismedina true no need to get anyone hurt...but I have a football mentality so I like physical play...they were banging the whole series
"@MdKomar18: @Campbell93 Yo I heard you are a comedian?" Haha I did stand up once but I'm no comedian...my bro @DodggerDodgedge is one
What Bynum did was classless but frustration brings the worst out of us all...Odom's was just a hard foul...didn't look that bad to me
Phil Jackson is by far the greatest coach to ever do it...11 championship isn't a bad track record
This is embarrassing for the lakers...Phil going out getting swept...not a good look
Happy Mothers Day to all the women out there trying to raise the future leaders of our world...we #appreciate you
@matlowercase that would be entertaining
"@matlowercase: @Campbell93 Between u & @SBreaston15  #Birdgangproductions" gotta hv a script 2 get @ddockett playin a 'Big Momma' role lol"
@Five2Eighty I like Rugby...watch the matches often..and if football didn't work out 4 me I would sign up but represent for us out there man
@AshLaRae haha is that where you get it from? (The apple doesn't fall far from the tree)
Everyday is Mothers Day to me...raising 8 kids you definitely need more than one day of appreciation...but we will celebrate today as well
"@RayRice27: Today I'm cooking lol yes I said I'm cooking red beans and rice,corn,stuffing, and baked chicken for mothers day" #dont.burn.it
@AshLaRae hey I'm just saying...if your mom won't eat your food then who will? lol...naw I'm sure you cook just fine
"@joebriggsesq: shout out to the mothers that have said "I brought you into this world.. and I will take you out!"" Haha definitely
@AshLaRae so you really can't cook then? Lol or just not as good as the teacher?
@RayRice27 man vegas is crazy man...you should be here...but its all good...good fight
I think I could be a heavyweight champ if I chose boxing lol
"@RayRice27: @Campbell93 what's good bro" been good man...you in vegas?
"@RayRice27: I'm curious to know who has Mosley winning this fight let me know" not winning but going the distance def
Okay knockout or decision? What do you think?
"@LarryFitzgerald: I'm shocked watching this game.What has happened to the Lakers?" They're not as hungry as they used to be
@MoSSwag94 on the way fam...hit me up
@FamousFlip happy bday man
"@kerryrhodes: If dallas wins 2nite this series is over!! But its no pressure tho Laker fans." That would be huge
Charles Barkley is cracking me up on the halftime show...he keeps it real
Best Buy just got the new Blackberry PlayBook Tablet! So many great apps and games, see for yourself! http://bit.ly/ePqtJS #ad
@AshLaRae when I started my journal I felt I had to go back to explain how I got to where I am now...very intriguing to look back on my life
@AshLaRae looks like you got your work cut out for you...I should write mines down too but its too time consuming...tried to keep a journal
@chris4322 I'm trying hard right now to make sure that happens
I have never been happy about anyone dying before...this is the 1st time I truly believe justice is served by death
"@Chester_Pitts: Wow! While peple are watching the royal wedding Pres. Obama sends the Black Ops in." We got his a$$
Do you think Memphis to win the series against OKC?
"@krisily: Woohoo game day you ready? I am http://bit.ly/jhSEZP" booooooo let's go Heat...and I actually like Boston a lot too but oh well
@jayfeely looks electrifying out there...would be nice to be at this game...enjoy it man
Paul Pierce looks like he doesn't belong on the court right now
Wade gonna drop 40 tonight
@PatPeterson7 welcome to the family man #birdgang
Memphis might be real
@BeanieWells26 went to a previewing of #fast-five last week...its a good movie homie
Allen Bailey is the biggest steal in the draft this year
Finally seeing my "U" guys getting drafted...make them pay for passing on you so many times...the later you get drafted the more motivation
@ImOnlyOneMan bring him to phx
A lot of offense and defensive linemen in the 1st round...the game is won in the trenches
I wonder if we can slip a Miami guy in the 1st round...B Harris or L Hankerson
"@ProFootballTalk: Mike wanted to be drafted higher than Maurkice. And he made it by three spots." That has to feel good
"@ShaunPhillips95: Almost time for the bolts to pick I'm getting excited." They got you a dog inside...he is a beast...keep the OT's off you
"@QuentinGroves52:  #SIDENOTE whoever gets Ryan Mallett is gonna get a hell of a steal!!"
Gotta rep all the Colorado guys in the league...congrats Nate Solder
"@ImJustSean: That AZ defense is about to be cold.  #Shoutout to former teammates @Campbell93 and @MrDanWilliams55" yessir
I played against Christian Ponder in college...he is a great player...earlier than expected but he is good player
"@SBreaston15: Areas of concern...none lol" haha that's what you call respect from the "experts"
Best available is the best move...and we need help in the return game too...I like it
Here we go! Let's get someone that will make a difference
Well there goes Von Miller...great player
The fans def let Roger Goodell have it at the draft...glad to see the fans got our back
@FamousFlip so I will have to leave it up to them..I haven't studied any film on the potential players so I couldn't give you a great reason
"@FamousFlip: “@Campbell93: Who would u draft with the 5 pick? & why?" Man we have a good front office and they have made great picks
"@ashleyreed11: @Campbell93 Hows that six pack coming along??" Its getting there...give me a month and I will be right...what's good w/ you?
If I were a GM I would always take the best player available. But your needs are important and our team has some big needs
Curious about who we are gonna draft but the crazy thing is whatever we don't get n the draft we need to get in free agency when that starts
@MARLONLWAYANS you watch the draft homie?
"@kerryrhodes:  #birdgang who would u wanna see us take in the draft? Fill me in."
"@ddockett: Aye let's go Coach whiz & the whole organization! Let's get a baller tonight with that 5th pick! Patrick peterson, or VON miller
Yeah Nuggets are tough but OKC is just a little tougher..nerve racking game...felt like I was playing KD might be the best player in the NBA
@SpoiledGrl I still have hope...still wish we pulled out game 1...so close but 3-1 is hard to overcome
"@JohnnyLasVegas: come on now C?!?! You know they are done! They will be golfing with my Suns come this weekend!"OKC is 2 good but u nvr kno
Do you think the Nuggets can pull out another win?
@ejo113 he def is on his grind...def reppin the #birdgang too...I'm not worried about @ddockett not putting in work...he always comes ready
@italiababcock happy birthday Justin
@ddockett I know you grinding...me too...but I'm just saying it may be a good idea to come for a week and workout with Dubb
@Kevin_Meeker4L thanks man...glad your a true fan
@ddockett when you coming back to phx man
@Kevin_Meeker4L yeah that would be crazy...pre combine some teams looked at me at OLB but I'm best at DE
@Th3RealBS I'm better with my hand on the ground...but I think I would be good at it...but I like what I do now
@AJtheRealest15 Peterson is a beast
"@AJtheRealest15: @Campbell93 Tell Graves to take Peterson with the 5th pick and move you to OLB." That would be interesting
I think I'm gonna go by the facility today and see what happens...do you think they will let me in?
"@MonteCarloSlots: Great time with @Campbell93 at @phillies @DBacks game." Yeah last night was a good time
The Nuggets won a game! Yes we didn't get swept
@GlennDorsey72 yessir just got in LA training...how you been? Where do you train?
@GlennDorsey72 what's good man? How you been?
"@AllenBailey57: @D_VanDyke8 @JaredQuay lol http://bit.ly/fLbLOG Lmao check out buddy face." Haha now this is hilarious
Just saw a crazy accident on the 101 and the 405...car flipped and smashed against wall...hope they're okay...prayers go up for them
"@tmar24: just met @Campbell93 at the.fast five screening real cool guy good talking to him  #muchlove" good meeting you too man
#Randomthought I wonder how many people in the world don't have any tattoos
@azsportsguy you make a valid point...I SHOULD have did a lot of things differently in my life too
@doniellecrim you ready for graduation?
Knicks should be up 2 to 0 on the series...I like the Celtics and they find ways to win games!
Been upsets all day hopefully my Nuggets can pull one out too
@msnaomik I've been done for a while...but that was serious...but we ran jog walked and sprinted
"@JODY_EVANS: Best of luck to @Campbell93 as he takes on the SM stairs today for the first time!" I died I need to get in top shape #hurting
what day is better than today to handle business?! #Grinding
man I can't wait for the NBA playoffs to start up...these games are boring
The Fans make the game...w/ limits you should support you team...booing a guy for where another teams jersey is okay...but fighting isn't
That's why I was happy to see the Saints win the SB 2 years ago...the city needed it...it brought all of NO together
Sports should be about bringing cities together and giving them something to believe in and cheer for...competition makes it fun
Oh my bad I had it the other way around...it was the dodgers fans to beat the giants fan into a coma...I will pray he comes out okay #scary
@RCLuna75 no one has ever asked me that before, its my routine before ever game but since it was the S.B. I had so much passion in my blood
I can't believe the SF Giants fans jumped the Dodgers fan after the game cuz he was reppin his team...you can't take the game so serious
@TheRealDano1 oh yeah I know about the wire
@azmadame_x I actually still haven't seen that...I heard its amazing
@JaredQuay I can't stalk my little bro? Naw I believe your future is bright homie
@luvthecards I may have to check it out
@FakeCoachTony I feed off the crowd so I had to keep them hype
"@JaredQuay: My name is Jared, and I aint perfect, but I work hard, so I deserve it..." What is it exactly that you deserve man?
There isn't any good movies on tv so I'm gonna have to netflix something...any ideas or recommendations?
@AnthonyDavis76 I'm training in LA homie...on the grind
@AnthonyDavis76 what's up man? Where you training at?
@luvnumber90 back in LA...had to get my workout in...this is gonna be a big year
If your in phx come to Doc's place to check out my man Tony Rock...camelback and 1st st...show about to start soon
I want to see my man Tiger Woods win the Masters today
Don't you just love it when your waitress is so happy go lucky...just happy to be at work or she thinks I'm cute...one of the two lol
Relaxin watchin Everybody hates Chris #funny
At the mall going to PF changs for dinner
TGIF on the real...hanging out with the bros...like everyday...trying to make today better than yesterday
@krisily I like the Celtics too...hopefully they get on a run before the playoffs get started
I love how dressed up people get to travel...especially the women...I'm in basketball shorts, tee shirt and flip flops...I like to be comfy
"@staceyleah74: @DodggerDodge @Campbell93 oh wow! theres 2 of them? lol" there is 6 boys and 2 girls...all very creative and funny lol
@DodggerDodge he's funny but Idk about funnier than Chris Rock man...Chris is one of the best to ever do it...Tony is up and coming
"@DodggerDodge Tony Rock coming to Phoenix This Sunday 7pm, Doc's Place. It's a Dodgger Dodge event. He's Chris Rock's brother but funnier."
@AshLaRae check out his website www.dodgger.com
@AshLaRae I retired my comedy career the day after it started lol...but my bros show is headlining Tony Rock this sunday at Doc's place
@Nathanbailey76 its a good movie
@MindyCuiksa we are all good...I'm getting ready to go to miami for the weekend
I just fried some fish for lunch...not the most healthy thing to eat but I got skills in the kitchen
@ashleyreed11 hey hey now I got an intense workout in...the abs are coming back...just gonna take a little while
@ShaunPhillips95 haha yeah I might just have to do that...I don't want to be looking stupid out there
I need to take some beginners classes tho...maybe I will look into it at my gym...yoga sounds hard
Imma say no to the yoga right now and relax...maybe go shoot some hoops
@jody_evans yes twitter has a bedtime...my mom always told me nothing good happens after 10pm so now what?
Should I do yoga?
@meezybaby27 I'm in LA for the offseason homie...training and relaxing...let me know when you got vegas on your mind man
@meezybaby27 how you been man...what city are you in?
@meezybaby27 the worst wingman in the history of the game? Com'on man...let's be serious...no one wants to be a wingman but I got you
That game would have been better if Kentucky was in it...but congrats to UConn...they earned it
Watching this interesting topic about paying college athletics on real sports with Bryant Gumbel
Wow that was a serious workout...took me 30mins just to catch my breath after...go hard or go home
@MARLONLWAYANS that's real talk...my brother does stand up...He even got me on stage for 5 mins...its def an Art
Wow that was a horrible shot
Basketball is a game of runs
This is going the way I need it too...come on Kentucky
This isn't a good start
1/7 from the 3 wow its a cold start
@A_Stone30 a lot of turnovers early man...but its pretty even
@A_Stone30 this one is for all the marbles...bragging rights is all I care about...1st time my bracket looks better than everyone else
Even tho I really like UConn and respect K Walker...I can't wait to see Kentucky win this championship
But it would have been nice to see an 11 seed loose to Kentucky in the championship
Well this one is over...VCU gave it away but that's okay cuz I picked Butler anyway
Missed freethrows will cost you every time
Even tho I think Butler is a better team I want to see the cinderella story happen...and see VCU pull this one out
@michaelstrahan ay man who are you taking today? I have Kentucky and Butler...but both games should be tight
@SteveBreaston ay man who you taking in the final four?
Watching biker boyz waiting for the games to come on...biker boyz is a cold lil movie
@Cards58 UConn is tough tho
@Cards58 I have been since I was a kid...they have let me down a few times in recent tourneys so I'm excited for this final four
"@kerryrhodes: So I got Butler and KY facing each other in championship" I seconded that...UK all the way
"@Cards58: @Campbell93 Who do you think will win the final four? Does VCU have any chance?" I'm a huge Kentucky fan so its UK all the way
@JohnnyLasVegas I was playing on it here pretty soon
Glad to be back tho...its a gorgeous day in LA and a lot of day left to do something fun and exciting
Had a blast in Hong Kong site seeing watching rugby and I really felt quite tall
Headed to Hong Kong to watch some Rugby and do some site seeing...let me know where I should go if you have been before!
@kerryrhodes I can't skate for nothing but I like the game...them boys are serious out there
Good finish to a long day
"@kerryrhodes: Pretty exciting first hockey game is ending in a shootout!!!" What you know about hockey man? That's a Colorado thing
Watching this 30 for 30 in the airport...19 year old Jalen Rose looks just like Nick Cannon to me lol
Man this girl just told me she gave up facebook for lent...crazy right?
@Guarton on here or how so? I def will
@MikeTurek it was good meeting you as well...I can always respect a true fan
"@JustMeGee: @Campbell93 how long u in town for budz?" Leave tmrw man
Prayers go out to the Wichard family...Gary was an amazing guy and will be missed...I appreciate the life he lived and may he rest in peace
What's up @kerryrhodes ? What part of the country you in man?
At least its gorgeous out...I love miami http://yfrog.com/hs5ypxvj
