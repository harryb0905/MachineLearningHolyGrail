That play may have been the exception to that rule bro https://t.co/SkW2d3n8ZG
Agreed. Bad decisions on that series bro https://t.co/kO5zRJWBye
The @Saints got robbed on that pass interference call. Can’t believe you lose a shot to get to the Super Bowl that way. This will hurt forever.

Come on man! It CAN NOT be that hard for you to have a little heart and class bro! https://t.co/JAlH97MPnR
I totally agree bro. That Dline has played great but so has that QB and Ross https://t.co/CrohkiGOKq
Are they? Or is it more @ClemsonFB being great than it is @AlabamaFTBL not being great? https://t.co/O8XXP4xWzk
I have never seen Nick Saban and his @AlabamaFTBL take a beaten like this. @ClemsonFB is going to be as good next year with that QB and number 8 Ross kid.
What a game this is between @ClemsonFB &amp; @AlabamaFTBL for the @NCAA #Championship
Just reminding peeps what I saw in the @NFL about the @dallascowboys back on 9/9/18 When I took a ride in the DeLorean 😂😂😂🏆🏆🏆 https://t.co/4P0tozef2H

I agree with that so chant @JoeFlacco name don’t boo the young @Lj_era8 who has you here!! Because Joe had you in the bad place before Lamar got you in the #PlayoffSeason #BEREAL https://t.co/gErfruJpAG
Is that the @Ravens crowd booing @Lj_era8 with basically the whole 4th Quarter to go?? What does that say about the Ravens Fan Base?
Just so all know I was the only one to pick @Chargers to beat @Ravens today in this @NFL Playoff game. I am the master when it comes time for analysis of the NFL  😂😂👍🏾👍🏾
Lets just say this. I was the only one to pick the @Chargers over the @Ravens on @NFLGameDay show this morning
We get seven days as #CowboysNation to enjoy and we must get back in the battle but our guys on the field has to turn the page by tonight once they find out who @dallascowboys will play next. @RamsNFL or @Saints in the @NFL #playoffs https://t.co/uFQJD7IBZs
This is how I feel today after my @dallascowboys won vs @Seahawks yesterday. It’s was the 1st WIN IN THE  #Playoffs for #CowboysNation  since 2K14 👍🏾👌🏾☝🏾👋🏾.  This time I got it right https://t.co/fCtnPnlIGg

But if Luck is not falling make sure the ball does. https://t.co/0pmYBgj458
I agree bro https://t.co/Ctulpetc18
That @Colts OL is pushing @JJWatt boys around on that DL like they are light weight and sorry
This is total domination by the @Colts over @HoustonTexans and now the Texans are losing key players.

Hey brother do you think you can find another football team in the WORLD that can beat the top team in the @NFL at American Football? It’s a rhetorical question. I know the answer is hell to the nah! Then it is, as I said, WORLD CHAMPIONS BUDDY🏆 https://t.co/PGBxFLxoXy
Tell your wife I said thank you. I think https://t.co/3MAydKg50c
The @nyjets don’t count Rich they have not been in a real race in sometime. I think we are all saying the same thing. It’s so hard to get in the playoff so you don’t want bad calls being the reason you don’t!! https://t.co/wmCVwRhXWR
I will be borrowing this statement my brother and using it on TV @richeisen don’t call me out when I steal this statement for my own use and not give the proper credit 😂😂 https://t.co/siKVo4EwZx
Merry Christmas to you and your father my brother. As a matter of fact Merry Christmas to everyone. I pray your day was spent with family and love ones 🙏🏾 https://t.co/WNdsqt1BKT
Yes my parents are from Valdosta Georgia buddy. https://t.co/4nZRAS1RMe
Hey buddy we can add management in there too. But that call did not help and it was not enough to alter the offensive player attempt at the ball. https://t.co/afRxdQN9sc
All that’s true brother. We can probably add the @LeVeonBell stuff in there too. But I don’t want to OVERCOME ALL THOSE OBSTACLES for the ref to make that call and cost me the game. https://t.co/KOx0GPcJ7h
No doubt brother. But I rather lose with a teammate trying to aggressively make a play than lose on a ref making a horrific call. https://t.co/YXwNP1PfR6
We need you brother so don’t do that but keep tuning in and let’s keep talking this great game. https://t.co/xqK8wXOIC0
It was a horrible call that cost the @steelers the @NFL Playoff. Unless the @Ravens stumble against the @Browns https://t.co/nWfOfcxvT2
Thanks for that encouragement my brother. https://t.co/P3RNpZpdYI
My return 2 @insidetheNFL⁩ was timed perfectly. I spit the gospel abt how the NFC EAST CHAMPS ⁦@dallascowboys⁩ cld become the @NFL World Champs. #CowboysNation I need u all 2 tune in 2morrow 9pm EST on ⁦@Showtime⁩ &amp; make sure they feel our presence in the rating🏆 https://t.co/aIl6zAIp5s

Hey bro we were doing the trading block not the Free agency block. So they ask who can the @dallascowboys trade for in this segment. If I really had my way. We can use them both. https://t.co/Uz4KRFtCjL

I have just rewind that interception over and over again. The @NFL will announce they miss that call later this week. Mark my word and I will wait on your praise when you hit me later and say PLAYMAKER you were right 😂 https://t.co/AlDSjSsA1x
Anything could have happened on 4th down bro. You take a Time out and let them look at it longer. That was not an interception https://t.co/aal4LdwwBH
CALL ONE OF THE 3 TIme outs you had left https://t.co/TETpcleAQu
😂😂😂I use to think that also bro https://t.co/3I4gsfjuiY
You can call time out to let them look at it more. They had 3 TO left https://t.co/yxVMbbnoCW
The @49ers should have challenged that interception. I don’t think he caught that pass. Now they will lose this game on a (I think)bad interception
We can only ask; what the hell! Where have this been on offense? https://t.co/9ulXk4fOy8
I like this defense a lot bro. Hot Boyz!!!! But don’t go to far yet bring @dallascowboys  a SHIP then we put you in that category. 🏆🏆🏆 https://t.co/pTUjDtN2ia

Dont mean 2 start mess but why do I c every1 like my dudes @stephenasmith &amp; @maxkellerman on @FirstTake so HOT abt  the @steelers no catch TD? But When @DezBryant made tht same play vs @packers no 1 said a damn thing when they took that playoff gm from #cowboynation. #shutup now

Now that's my son @DezBryant that's how you lift @dallascowboys by carrying the whole @AZCardinals on your back!! #88 being great https://t.co/KupQvKBOHq
Make sure #cowboynation when u go 2 sleep tonight that u get on ur knees &amp; thank God we have @TankLawrence on @dallascowboys right now
U c what happens when @dallascowboys get pressure on the QB 4 @AZCardinals. We must win on the front end until we learn 2 cover on the back
Wow what a horrible start to this game for @dallascowboys vs @AZCardinals
This will be a long night if the @dallascowboys can't get pressure on @AZCardinals QB
.@aeneas35 &amp; I r great friends now. We had gr8 battles. Now we sit in a room 2gether n Canton Ohio @ProFootballHOF every year &amp; reminisce🙏🏾 https://t.co/ueUhaL0N4O
That's why I am wearing it. I will wear the color of the opponent until it does not work for my @dallascowboys https://t.co/718t87Uwg4
I did see those catches he made. Almost got his first TD 4 @CanesFootball. I was worried about that game since we did not play for weeks. https://t.co/ilH7gqgVgV
I am wearing the colors of my @dallascowboys opponents @AZCardinals to help my boys win @NFL Monday Night Football 🏈 #cowboynation https://t.co/g8FYGGxi2G

Smart bro🤜🏾🤛🏾 https://t.co/hXsuI7B6P0
Bing Bing! I say Tom Brady is the #goat of @NFL especially when u consider distance travel fr #199 to 5 rings/ @TroyAikman 1st pick overall https://t.co/iCyCDq2T2G
You guys are only looking with your heart not you brain. Sometime you have to separate the two and talk @nfl https://t.co/yCes4fmTUy
My point Exactly. Welker was NOT vertical only Moss. Run 1st =defense. My job is 2 study games. This may b much 🏈knowledge 4 u guys😂 https://t.co/yCes4fmTUy
System has NOT CHANGED they use diff peeps but do same things. Tom early yrs they won w defense. Also consider defensive rule of today game https://t.co/t74wnjSSbm
The ? Was who I would take. My skill set of running deep in, out &amp; skinny post fits perfectly with @TroyAikman skill set of throwing. https://t.co/hkr5szZQf6
I give #goat 2 Rice too. He played n 2x the games (303/159) he has 2x the Rec (1549/750) 2x the yds (22895/11904) but same #Rings💍💍💍🏈⭐️🤜🏾🤛🏾 https://t.co/04dihzWX2s
Just #TRUTH Brady plays inside out (87/11) main targets @TroyAikman played outside n (88) main target. I never went inside (it takes big💪🏾) https://t.co/gxKUH8ruG9
Its abt systems @TroyAikman can play n @Patriots system. Not sure Brady has the arm to fit @dallascowboys system (deep out takes big arm)💪🏾 https://t.co/lb4NdE68rb
Where did you see the #88 contest? https://t.co/YdJyuI908C

Love that description of @Isaiah_Thomas that's exactly what he is. HE IS A BEAST!!!!! https://t.co/aspRdp5gn1
I totally concur https://t.co/A3Vx0U7Q0P
I hope this @NBAonTNT game 7 between @WashWizards vs @celtics is as great as the build up has been. @JohnWall vs @Isaiah_Thomas Who u got?
Can't wait to see how we do with that QB situation this fall. https://t.co/OUvOVvGyHn
Congrats to my bro @Hawk on doing the thang. 😂😂👑👑😂😂 https://t.co/7MEYent5Xm
You are watching and seeing the difference. You are a smart man bro. You see with more than your eyes. It called the gift of discern meant https://t.co/73TPzWOW7M
Doesn't work like tht bro. Peeps don't play better just b/c u say so. U must know how to reach down inside the kid &amp; pull out the KING👑 https://t.co/dZoNPw05sn
My boy @ShannonSharpe knows this is NOT the area he wants to compete with me. HE IS SHARP, BUT I AM THE SHARPEST!!! 👑🤛🏾 https://t.co/GBbAqk0zi9
As a kid u may not understand (unless u attend Playmakers Academy)but as a man u have 2 know this. They will need @KlayThompson vs @cavs https://t.co/JMWgzTWlkd
Man Im in crazy great shape. All Im doing is working out lately. My work out room is so tired of me it tried to lock me out the other day😂 https://t.co/6ccQK4bZYT
One thing I teach at Playmaker Academy is how 2 build a Championship n team sports. Every1 dont have this knowledge https://t.co/0tQmbyqEGT
That's my point. That's why he went 2/10 bro. Trust me on this. You have to know these small things to win big rings. https://t.co/3hKTUqAEUu
3/3 before I got there. Maybe this is why klay is not playing his best. A builder knows this, an adder does not. Any thoughts anyone?
2/3 when they won the ring if I was KD I wouldnt allow that! U would have to take all 3 of us together or those two like they were doing
1/3 Watching @warriors post game press conference I c @StephenCurry30 &amp; @KDTrey5 2gether when it use to be @KlayThompson
@halladayfan32 3/3 before I got there. Maybe this is why klay is not playing his best. A builder knows this, an adder does not. Any thoughts anyone?
@halladayfan32 2/3 when they won the ring if I was KD I wouldn't allow that! You would have to take all 3 of us together or those two like they were doing
@halladayfan32 1/3 Watching @warriors post game press conference I see @StephenCurry30 &amp; @KDTrey5 2gether when it use to Steph &amp; @KlayThompson

It is bro https://t.co/ABlxNY8gJW
Much luv 4 that bro &amp; I got #MAD love &amp; respect 4 my boy  @ShannonSharpe also. He won in more than one place. He makes others play great🏈 https://t.co/xOp7v4sbDV
I don't since we have drive to the game together and had dinner. I didn't sign anything for you that day bro? How did we do that? https://t.co/pps9SfQLKQ
True but u can have a superior player who plays great or a less than superior player who make those around him play great. Take the latter https://t.co/Yq9BezYmMA
It is beautiful outside bro but great debate abt the greatest game in the world that I love so much is beautiful also.🏈❤️🏈❤️🏈 https://t.co/3X7WHwzku3
But no championship that year. That does not hurt TB cause that helps his cause ask @Patriots fan. It's not abt winning games. It's rings https://t.co/4aweOV6h3Q
NOT EVERYTHING BRO. JUST EVERYTHING ABT WINNING CHAMPIONSHIP. I WON A CHAMPIONSHIP ON EVERY LEVEL. I HAVE MORE RING THAN U HAVE N UR TUB😂😂 https://t.co/fnm55XrrfQ
Not true. dont work like tht Some peeps can build a championship &amp; some can only b add 2 a championship! @EmmittSmith22 =selfless builder https://t.co/YqSft1aLND
Way to look them up and hook them up bro https://t.co/lIwzPBUsGp
Yes Tom Brady is the best ever bro!! https://t.co/AVPe6HqbYP
Not as good at short yards or pass Protection He was the most electrifying back but not the greatest back. https://t.co/tYbMKvnIFH
Bro I was here when that same o-line was blocking 4 others &amp; we went NO WHERE. @EmmittSmith22 brought the best out of that O-line https://t.co/B1VNbvimKx
Short yards need 1 or 2 yards @EmmittSmith22 was the best also. https://t.co/grtLKkyGnb
Thats not wht the numbers say. All numbers Yards, TD's &amp; most importantly rings. Give me some1 better. That complete all category? U cant! https://t.co/Qc6unh86BU
Many debate the GREATEST RB OF ALL TIME. I saw it 1st hand &amp; I will take NO 1 OVER MY GUY @EmmittSmith22 Happy Bday🎉 https://t.co/c8xK4EsRIr
So much for @spurs stealing that game 1 win vs @warriors. That must really really sting all of #spursnation 🤜🏾🤛🏾
I dont know if I can purchase tht ticket bro. This maybe just a little rust 4 @warriors. But this is where they will miss Steve Kerr also https://t.co/GxoyCyHmPL
Dude are you saying you rather the @cavs play the @warriors over playing the @spurs in the @NBA Finals? https://t.co/KCtWrbQnwT
So much for @warriors running away with these @NBA games vs @spurs I bet no one can say they saw this coming. Can Spurs hold up all game?🏀

You are right to all the young guys that played for the @spurs they deserve props. https://t.co/q6rDt0tzlJ
With that kind of effort. There was no heart to take out of then bro. They must have worn out only playing 7 players all series long. https://t.co/8KnJp2XOKn
And he did https://t.co/VqsqOPI0Zn
Cant believe the effort fr @JHarden13 &amp; @HoustonRockets vs @spurs w/o @kawhileonard/@tonyparker maybe the worse EVER in a close out game👎🏾

Hey I REALLY REALLY LIKE @nino9brown I will tweet why I like him so much https://t.co/UgTwDEQXD4
Like the @CarrollCity pick up. But all these young guys at 1 time or another have wanted 2 b @Revis24  they will hang on his every word https://t.co/DyJjS3EXsA
When u r this young n the secondary having another SMART VETERAN 2 go alone w @OScandrick32 2 teach guys how 2 study can b good https://t.co/cgPXUPVfaU
Bro I may b ok w tht. Its all on where @Revis24 is &amp; wht he is willing 2 b 4 @dallascowboys (player/teacher or a star) (I may call Revis) https://t.co/cgPXUPVfaU
Was he talking about @spurs beating @warriors? I did not know they beat them 11 out of 12 games. Is that true? https://t.co/zYmPtCOwsO
No really who is he talking about? I really don't know. No shot at my man. Just asking for knowledge https://t.co/j7Kc1zrwyA
Nope but I have heard about those games. https://t.co/ET5hHnfj95
Who is we bro? https://t.co/9O3xoZdKRl
This is an incredible game we all must admit that. Best one yet between @HoustonRockets and @spurs 👍🏿🏀👍🏿🏀 https://t.co/SdS7x54vx7
Appreciate that bro but I plan on working thats what I meant. https://t.co/phthYpWDGS
Who would be a better game for @warriors in the Western Conference Finals? @HoustonRockets or @spurs?
Absolutely bro! https://t.co/ay8OKps06k
This is a great game between @HoustonRockets vs @spurs
I hit you back bro. Just could not get the pic over here https://t.co/O5bYrwgnD4
.@EZ4ED Luv wht I see w the @RAIDERS I spent time w those guys @BIrvin_WVU11 &amp; @52Mack_ they have the rite mind set https://t.co/x7RDuUYx39
That more difficult to call because we don't have a fix on the QB yet. https://t.co/Vmv5xOpPkf
Yes I have and I loved it. I did a speaking tour with @JTFoxx a few years ago in Vancouver. I have wanted to get back every since. https://t.co/cWRjXcJszp
Right especially to a guy like @tonyromo who was not drafted and became the all time leader in many @dallascowboys category https://t.co/0VjntLBunw
Every defense is going to focus on stoping the run with @EzekielElliott that should leave much room for @DezBryant to roam https://t.co/14LUGiha6k
That may make the best OL in the league even better. He will be a RFA also after the season so he will be so motivated. Great point https://t.co/LWaJzqtFYx
They will put you in jail these days for the stuff our parents did to us. https://t.co/6XWCUzwuqy
When he sees himself on TV with those extra pounds the camera puts on you he will get that thing right and he will be ready. https://t.co/krBACbBPVC
Yeah I do but @DezBryant must be in the 1500 https://t.co/H4aOk0NYUk
The @AtlantaFalcons was the team I was worried abt last season but when u change OC it changes things. It might not work the same this yr https://t.co/aHYoPXvT1F

I totally concur buddy. https://t.co/VAR8fuksvq
😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/7vsjcuWvXE
I would agree if he had a ring bro. But with this team and a chance to be a hero &amp; also win a ring. NO WAY HE WONT TAKE THAT CHANCE👍🏿 https://t.co/YdJvEunXwd
I have nothing against Kap but Divide thoughts n the locker room may start in 1 area &amp; then manifest in others. U have 2 b careful w that. https://t.co/JiXEPDmTsd

Thanks for having me on today’s #TV23Chat @TroyVincent23. Appreciate the conversation.
Q14) When facing adversity, what's the 1st thing you say to yourself before you deliver the message to your team and/or employees? #TV23Chat
Q13) Compare the challenges of leading a defense on a football team to the challenges of leading the front office of the @NFL. #TV23Chat
Q12) What was the greatest thing you learned about adversity during your time on the field? #TV23Chat https://t.co/7XkfNjMXhF
Q11) How would you push your teammates through a difficult practice &amp; how have you applied those tactics to @NFLFootballOps? #TV23Chat
Q10) As Executive VP of @NFLFootballOps, what are your toughest challenges? How do you mitigate them? #TV23Chat https://t.co/NdVnTxQdrH
Q9) What adversity did you face when earning respect of new teammates? New employees? #TV23Chat https://t.co/5OTXUZ5VUr
Q8) When you left @MiamiDolphins for @Eagles, what challenges did you face while moving your family &amp; joining a new team? #TV23Chat
Thanks for the discussion @TroyVincent23 – now I have some questions for you. https://t.co/v77QJV4Ab1
A7) Forget the last play and focus on the next. In leadership, you must get the focus off yesterday and keep it on tomorrow. #TV23Chat
A6) ACL surgery in '89 put me in a deep depression. I had to stop comparing where I was to where I used to be—focus on small steps #TV23Chat
A5) Successful teams are like successful corporations. Corps. have heads of departments (managers), teams have position leaders. #TV23Chat
A4) Massive turnover after a 1-15 record in 1989. Building our nucleus while maintaining our values was crucial to three titles. #TV23Chat
A3) In football it’s 45 sec to recognize adversity, receive the knowledge, recover &amp; run to next play. You do that in life #TV23Chat (2/2)
A3) In football, you can’t have individual, isolated success. You must work well w/ others; this is true in life &amp; business #TV23Chat (1/2)
A2) @Eagles drafted @BobbyTaylor21 &amp; signed you to stop me. Had to give 110% in all aspects of the game. #TV23Chat https://t.co/wkQT8QcQSd
A1) Everyone hated playing on the turf at the Vet. Had to focus on winning—not the challenging conditions. #TV23Chat https://t.co/tTVMObnR3o
Thanks for having me on @TroyVincent23! Excited to get started. #TV23Chat https://t.co/MXkQPBVEZ7
