White Supremacy is a moral and ethical dialogue. It's not just about trashing an individual -- it's about hating and trashing white supremacy as a whole. Watch the discussion here on @AC360 -- https://t.co/dLlKsdT5oZ
Martin Luther King Jr turned away from popularity in his quest for spiritual and moral greatness – measured by what he was willing to give up and sacrifice due to his deep love of everyday people, especially vulnerable and precious black people.
In this brief celebratory moment of King’s life and death, we should be highly suspicious of those who sing his praises yet refuse to pay the cost of embodying King’s strong indictment of the US empire, capitalism, and racism in their own lives.
Such a blessing and an honor to celebrate Praire View! https://t.co/rQdl6Uphx5

King was a product of a black prophetic tradition, full of fire in his bones, love in his heart, light in his mind, and courage in his soul. He’s not an isolated icon on a pedestal to be viewed as some figure in a museum. Let us learn from him and from them all. #MLK #MLKDay
While terrorized and Jim-crowed, King learned something from such figures as Frederick Douglas, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells, A. Phillip Randolph, and Marcus Garvey. #MLKDay
When you look into the eyes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., you see that tradition. He’s a part of a tradition of a people who were terrorized, traumatized and stigmatized for 400 years. #MLKDay

I endorse Brother @BernieSanders because he is a long-distance runner with integrity in the struggle for justice for over 50 years.
My endorsement of Brother Bernie is not a downplaying of the immorality of the ugly Israeli occupation of Palestinians...
My endorsement of Brother Bernie in the primaries is not an affirmation of the neo-liberal Democratic Party...
And calls into question his commitment to "make America great again." #Trump
His unpatriotic complicity with the plutocratic corruption of our political system for over 30 yrs calls into question his integrity #Trump
Trump's kind of nativistic hostility could have excluded them.
...and grandfather (Mr. Drumpf) was born in Germany. #Trump
Trump's attacks on precious Mexican brothers and sisters are unconscionable -- even as his blessed mother was born in Scotland...
Yet only Bernie has authenticity and integrity, whereas Trump is for real but not for right.
Brother Bernie and Brother Trump are authentic human beings in stark contrast to their donor-driven opponents.
...patriarchy and homophobia, deserve our critical support. Yet even more important is the issue of integrity.
And prophetic politicians -- always with their faults and blind spots -- who tell the truth about Wall Street, white supremacy, empire...
Social movements in the streets and jails over against the Establishment in both decrepit political parties are fundamental.
Only organized power of courageous and compassionate people can turn around these catastrophic realities.
And the political system is collapsing due to the weight of corrupt lobbyists and greedy capitalists.
The American Empire is in decline. Our market-driven culture is in decay. The criminal justice system has failed us.

We must connect catastrophe to courage and compassion. We must have the intellectual courage to tell the truth.
...yet every human life is precious and resistance to occupation is inevitable.
Let us not forget that ugly war crimes of any occupying power always outstrip those of the occupied...
Our righteous indignation at the murder of hundreds of Palestinian babies should be the same as that of the murder of Jewish babies.
Moral &amp; political response to the actual Israeli occupation &amp; invasion should be the same as that of a non-existent Palestinian occupation.
The litmus test should be what would U.S. media coverage look like of a nearly 50 year Palestinian (cont) http://t.co/8wHcPLWmXp
.@rulajebreal of @MSNBC is right: U.S. media coverage of the Israeli occupation &amp; invasion of Gaza is grossly biased against Palestinians.
We must never forget a precious Palestinian baby as the same value as a precious Jewish baby.
We all are complacent with this bloodshed if we do not raise our voices to condemn all crimes and all forms of terrorism.
There is much blood on the hands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Obama and Hamas.

Is Obama as committed to justice for Trayvon as he is to prosecuting Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden?
Does not his silence on poverty and race hide the sufferings of our precious Trayvons and Marissas here and abroad?
Will the Obama apologists now admit the sad truth about his pathetic words and actions for Black and poor people?
Will our “color-blind” president ever wake up?
Yet the murder of over 200 innocent children by U.S. drones is also criminal.
Our criminal justice system is itself criminal, especially for poor and Black people.

Malcolm X was faithful until his last day, in his love for the Black poor. He wasn’t a saint but rather an extraordinary man.

True democracy faces down narrow, exclusive perspectives that make it difficult to open our minds to alternatives.
These are made accountable through democracy.
Democracy contests fundamentalism - religious fundamentalism, free-market fundamentalism, secular fundamentalism.
...but rooted in that burying - that dying to live more fully.
Democracy is all about dialogue, discussion, & critical exchange, bold speech, frank speech...

There’s an increasing ambivalence about the status of America through the eyes of most people in the world. #G8Summit http://ow.ly/4Zy4c
In that sense, it's a kind of blues-inflicted hope rather than a cheap American optimism that motivates me.
I never give up on any human being no matter what color, because I believe they all have potential.
I'm never optimistic. From that angle, the evidence always looks undetermined. But I am full of #hope.
We speak to my dear brother Former New York Mayor David Dinkins, the 1st and only Black mayor of #NYC, on #SmileyAndWest: http://ow.ly/4Unyo
What he didn't add was, when you start walking, you can get crushed, go to jail, or get killed.
That's a hard message because people had to pay a price.
#MLK said, "...Whenever men & women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, b/c a man can't ride your back unless it's bent."

My personal words had to do with being disrespected by the President.
...including the Obama Administration.
This discussion is in no way about me, it has to do with poor and working people having low priority in US governmental policy...

Bro @TheRevAl is in a tough space and I’m deeply concerned about him. http://ow.ly/4Bm8J

Listen to this exclusive preview of #SmileyAndWest & share your thoughts on our Speak Out Network http://ow.ly/4AsNF
This weekend on #SmileyAndWest, I reflect deeply on last Sunday's debate w/ my dear brother @TheRevAl http://ow.ly/4Arup
Stay strong my brothers and sisters of all colors.
This is in part why poor & working people are catching hell, and too few #love & care for them to speak out. http://ow.ly/4zCob
...Just as the Republican Party is the right wing face of the same group of elite. http://ow.ly/4zCks
Sadly, much of the Democratic Party is the centrist face of Wall Street oligarchs & corporate plutocrats. http://ow.ly/4zCgM
The #MLK criteria: Always making poor & working people your priority & fighting organized greed at the top. http://ow.ly/4zC2F
The closeness between my dear brother @TheRevAl & Pres. Obama must be honestly examined in light of what we can call the #MLK criteria:
Brother @TheRevAl's courageous record of struggle for poor & working people is undeniable. http://ow.ly/4zBRR
I remain profoundly disappointment in the POTUS' weak & feeble resistance to the vicious attack on poor & working people. http://ow.ly/4zBM5
I am fundamentally committed to telling the #truth about the ugly right-wing policies that crush poor & working class peoples....
We all must agree to sometimes disagree b/c so much is at stake w/ the precious poor babies, elderly & so many others. http://ow.ly/4yDXi
The focus must be how we fight back in this vicious war of Wall Street oligarchs & corporate plutocrats against poor & working people.
The recent heated exchange with my dear brother @TheRevAl is not about him, me or even primarily about the President. http://ow.ly/4yDxA
In #love, I remain critical to all who by commission or omission muffle the voice of the suffering...more to come.
Manning Marable never sold his soul for a mess of pottage. He kept his eye on his vision. http://ow.ly/4wOMR
Listen in to #SmileyAndWest as we remember my friend of 30yrs political scientist, sociologist & activist Manning Marable http://ow.ly/4wOHG
But @TheRevAl is wrong to provide cover to POTUS given the level of Black suffering & misery. #SmileyAndWest http://ow.ly/4wxce
Bro. @TheRevAl has such a rich tradition of fighting for #justice & a very deep connection to poor & working people.
Is everything here up for sale? No democracy can survive in that context.

I give tribute to the incredible courage of my precious Egyptian bros & sis calling for an end to the ugly US backed tyranny of Mubarak.

One of my online friends wants me to explain how we bring police brutality to a close and fight the prison industrial system...
I would #LOVE to reschedule the UVM/MLK event for another date in close proximity, as this conversation is one of evergreen relevance.
Brothers and sisters at University of Vermont, the aggressive east coast storm has made it impossible for me to attend today’s MLK event.
My blues sister @MaryJBlige took a #Funk classic & gave us a message inherent w/ #Hope & #Love. LISTEN: http://ow.ly/3KEqg
Those young educated gangsters in “The Social Network” are "at risk" - consumed by hubris, arrogance & greed, missing out on #love & life.
Anyone who suffers from spiritual malnutrition with moral constipation inherit in it...they are really at risk.
I don’t care too much for the term “at-risk” when it comes to our precious children. I’m “at-risk” if that’s the case.
If we don’t adapt to those priorities, we will cont to scapegoat, demonize & thereby undercut the morale of our teachers. http://ow.ly/3IVTe
Finland reflects a fundamentally different set of priorities in America.
15% of Finland's college graduates teach in schools rather than make their way to Wall Street to be millionaires.
Teachers in Finland receive the salaries of many of our businesspeople.
In Finland there are 2 teachers in classrooms of 14.
I do... Canada, not Kennedy... RT @nerdosyndical: @CornelWest do you mean Geoffrey Canada?
...and Finland's students take few, if any standardized tests.
Yet those countries with the best education systems in the world, like Finland, have over 90% of their teachers unionized...
"Waiting for Superman" scapegoat’s teachers’ unions.
I have great love and respect for brother Geoffrey Kennedy. But I had a deep critique of the film, in which he was central.
Sister Wendy Kopp, founder and president of Teach for America, takes @TavisSmiley & me deep inside the education debate: http://ow.ly/3IVTe

With rising voices like @LupeFiasco, it’s becoming hip & cool to be a thinker…a freedom fighter…to be concerned with the least of these.
We live in a world where the definition of success is material toys and being well adjusted to injustice.
Brothers & sisters, I want to know your vocation, not your profession…how are you living your life’s purpose?

Tea Party brothers & sisters are indeed my brothers and sisters. I don't dismiss anybody...I'm a Christian.
Nevertheless I will con't to advocate for their freedom to have their voice be heard their freedom to be wrong & for us to agree to disagree
As noted last night, the Tea Party is fueled by anger that gov't is corrupt…but in it there is no doubt a racist element.
What a night it was to have such an honest discussion w/ the brothers and sisters on the #AmericasNextChapter panel.
#LA, I'm coming to sunny Los Angeles soon and I want to meet you. To find out how go to: www.hopeonatightrope.com

We should seek to find the courage to commit to love and justice by being in one's own center.
We don't want to confuse being centrist and moderate, with being committed to #love and #justice.
We need to muster the courage first to tell us the truth about ourselves.  We deal with too many lies.
To look at hatred in the face and talk about #love...
The vocation of the intellectual is to turn easy answers into critical questions and to put those critical questions to people with power.

Been having a magnificent time in #NYC w/ brother @tavissmiley & brother Raymond.
This overlooks the deplorable plight of poor & working people.
Nevertheless, Congress still tends to function like an institution of legalized bribery & normalized corruption...
But thank God we witnessed a blow against homophobia for our gay brothers & lesbian sisters.
Congress once again killed the Dream of precious newly arrived young immigrants.
In short, the game today was a great triumph of "Free Men of Color" along with our allies of all colors.
NYC has been great to me! And I can't believe I met @BGsays last night. #Blessings

What conceptions of #JUSTICE regulate the Department of Justice?
Is it the case that torture or crime against humanity & wiring tapping, a flagrant violation of citizens' liberty, have so little weight?
Interesting how ferociously the Dept. of Justice is pursuing the leakers, yet no concern what so ever for recent torturers or wire tappers.

Wall Street oligarchs and corporate plutocrats dominate our political, economic and cultural systems.
And we have powerful, and often greedy, Wall Street oligarchs and corporate plutocrats.
We have a slipping working class that considers itself middle class.
We have the poor and outcast...
We have three dominant classes in contemporary America:
The Prison Industrial Complex...The New Jim Crow...thoughts?
...Usually locked up for drug charges.
Looking at American prisons in our day, we see primarily poor people, disproportionately but not exclusively black & brown.
That is...who is in those prisons, how'd they get there, and how much money is allocated to sustain it...
One can always discover much about any society by looking at the prison system.
Social neglect & political abandonment of poor people have resulted in a criminal justice system tilted against the poor.
Poverty in America is invisible in our public discourse.
We had a good chat on the #SmileyAndWest show Speak Out network last night. If you were there, thank you. If not...I love you anyway.

#LOVE can change the world
To intervene in someone’s life when nobody else loves him or her is transforming.
Non-marketplace values, like #LOVE, struggle against a market-driven culture.
Many young people are disconnected from that history of sacrifice and commitment.
Freedom fighters keep track of the indescribable scars & bruises but refuse to be victims.
We should #hope for a shift toward a quest for wisdom…from the street hustler to the freedom fighter. RE: @NYPL w/ Jay-Z
Paideia: Deep education that informs and transforms us so we shift from "bling bling" to "let freedom ring."

Respect the young folk; but, when you respect you have to correct.
Sometimes you have to jump outside of the old school and spend some time in the new.
I know that I am who I am because somebody loved me.
American democracy can't afford to lose another generation.
Through hip-hop, young people have told us that "if you don't have time to raise us, we're going to raise ourselves.
#Love is a catalyst for change. When you love on folk, people can change.

Anytime you think of sexuality, you've got to think of your whole life.
...Yet to keep on stepping because the something that sustains you no empire can give you and no empire can take away.
To be a Christian is to live dangerously, honestly, freely - to step in the name of love as if you may land on nothing...

Young folk are shaped by what older folk present to them.

My dear brother & sister, The Spooner's, white farmers, spoke up & told the truth about the decency & courage of Shirley Sherrod.
I also salute my dear white brother and sister Rodger and Eloise Spooner.
But this time, truth and goodness triumphed.
We saw this with brother Van Jones, and now we see it again.
We have another example of vicious attacks in vitriolic assaults on someone who is a real force for good in the world.
Shirley Sherrod maintained her dignity and intergrity in the face of mendacity and adversity.
I pay tribute to my dear sister and fellow freedom fighter Shirley Sherrod.
We must never allow black suffering to blind us to other people's suffering.
Morally, all racisms are the same.
Race has the power to generate levels of polarization that will make it difficult for us to communicate with one another honestly.
Race still matters. Can America be truthful about itself and still pursue democracy?
The very notion that black people are human beings is a revolutionary concept for the West.
Black folk are just as human as anybody else - with ups and downs, strengths and weaknesses, ignorance and wisdom.
...Not because black people have a monopoly on virtue or are always on the side of justice.
Black America has served as a kind of moral mirror for America...
