Today illustrates that doing what is right for those who need it most can still happen in Washington. The @HouseCommerce advanced the ACE Kids Act. I congratulate and extend my heartfelt thanks to my colleagues and those who have advocated on behalf of ACE Kids over the years.
Tomorrow, @HouseCommerce will vote to pass the ACE Kids Act out of the full Committee. This legislation will help children with complex medical conditions and their families. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this legislation and bring it to the House Floor.
The @HouseCommerce will hold a legislative hearing on the ACE Kids Act, September 5. ACE Kids is a very important bill that I have been working on for the past couple of years, that will help vulnerable children with very difficult medical conditions receive the care they need.
I applaud Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey @jack for promising to appear before @HouseCommerce next week. I look forward to a robust discussion on privacy and data usage.
The late Senator John McCain will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda on Friday, August 31, 2018. The Capitol Rotunda will be open to the public from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM, in order for the public to pay their respects. The public will enter through the Capitol Visitors Center (CVC)
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Senator John McCain. He and I sat next to each other on the Interior Committee from 1985-1986. He was a good friend and a true patriot. He will be greatly missed.
