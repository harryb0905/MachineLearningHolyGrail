@inrng I think it was maybe not exactly a 'Col' per say, went through Bonvillard. Awesome (but tough) ride though
@NatalieFratto There's a position available as a support car driver 😂 - then you could join us at the pitstops and we wouldn't have to carry all of our shit around!!

This kid was the most professional cyclist I have ever seen, while not even yet being an 'official' professional. He approached cycling with an insane drive and unreal work ethic, which I know he will apply to his rehab. Let's help him in any way we can.  https://t.co/j8YTRezuKm

Gave everything today, but sometimes you need the race to play into your hands as well. One of the most intense days I’ve had on a bike. If I couldn’t keep the jersey, I couldn’t be happier to see a young guy like @jstar_97 take it. I hope it changes your life like it did mine.

@SqueakOReilly Haha I could hear them too 😂😂😂 no clue
@navaranick @VelonCC @AquaBlueSport Yep!
It was a fun day out front yesterday, especially being in the break with some buddies! Unfortunately, the peloton had other ideas for us than to fight for the win 🙄... On to the next one! https://t.co/86vboFAbfR
A lesson that most of us can take note from!!!! #enjoyyourself https://t.co/OvwrgAhtWc
Great chatting with you guys and hope I can give you a bit to talk about on your upcoming coverage of @TdS 😉 #TDS https://t.co/nI7i5sWmPe
@brentbookwalter Because Astana. 😂
It might be mid-season for us, but it’s never too late for you to start your training! Our trainers have put together some training programs and they’re less than 20€! Check them out👇🏽 https://t.co/gUPKsrEPIy
Good luck @geoffreyburns - you’re ready to fly man!!!! https://t.co/Xa4LBNAPjT
@davidjohn1983 @AdamMyerson Decent, but average...
@TomHainesworld @AdamMyerson Can't put a price on deliciousness 😂
@AdamMyerson Honeycrisp are the absolute best! Unfortunately they haven’t made it to Europe yet... so I’m stuck with the runner up
@mrconde Eggs were bad for you in 1997... today they’re practically a superfood 😂
If years down the road they ever discover that oats, eggs, or pink lady apples are bad for you.... I’m dead.

Today was an @velotoze day! We’re lucky to have them on board with @AquaBlueSport this season. One of the best gear developments I have had the pleasure of using in my career, they make rainy days bearable! #velotoze #aquabluesport https://t.co/b8JRFRowgJ
@ammattipyoraily The one thing I believe has made the biggest difference in this statistic over the years is the increasing amount of aero equipment we are all on... Definitely impacts the speed.
When in Norway... buy a stick of reindeer meat! ...sorry Santa! https://t.co/dm2iFsqZ36
The last two days we’ve driven halfway across Norway. It’s so gorgeous everywhere you turn, it seems as if the whole country is a National Park...
@LPNordhaug Lars! Where are you?! I thought we would see you here at Tour of Norway!
@kelleyrobinson Tour of Norway!
@kelleyrobinson Are you seriously in Oslo??? I’m in Norway too!!!

But on the other hand, I escaped with nothing other than minor scrapes, and I think we just saw one of the classiest podiums in Pro bike racing. Massive congratulations to @BobJungels @rusty_woods and @romainbardet - 3 of the coolest guys in the bunch. Chapeau boys!
Well, that sucked. Crashed from the front group in a corner after La Redoute. Hit a patch of sand, front wheel washed out, and down on the ground when the race was on. Really a shame as I desperately wanted to do a great ride in my favorite race of the year. #LBL18
RIP Andy. Such a kind and friendly guy, it was an honor to have him as a boss. Cycling lost a good man yesterday. https://t.co/xsRtXCcMTt
I find it funny that hairdressers are so concerned about what you think about the back. Like, this will be the only time I see the back of my head ‘til the next time I sit in this chair...
And usually I feel like the only one in the bunch who gets mad about this! 🙄 👏🏽 https://t.co/SstuHddj05

@ammattipyoraily Yep.
It's after 6 pm. The only times I have left my bed today were to pee and to eat. I'm not sick, actually quite the opposite. Ohhh, the glorious life of a cyclist.
I don’t care who just won, @CalebEwan you’re an absolute legend!!!!!!!!! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
When’s this race start again??? #MSR
A few people have asked me if our @AquaBlueSport casual clothing is for sale - it is! Check it out on the website, before it sells out (again!)...  My favorite is our @JomaSport hoodie - https://t.co/nhrLHyfSHW It's so comfy I've been living in it the whole time here at altitude!
He’s a hero on the bike AND off! Thank you so much @TMarczynski for rescuing me from the side of the road, stuck in a snowstorm halfway up the mountain... Seriously saved me today!
@lizziedeignan @PhilipDeignan Congrats guys!!!!!!

@stefandenifl Salmon is the ENEMY!!! 💥💥💥😂😂😂

@cyclistdata Yep!
Off to Sierra Nevada for a couple week training camp. You know you’re headed somewhere exciting when you pack 2 (!!!) pairs of sweatpants... 😂
I’d love to be on the start line tomorrow, but regardless, I am so excited to watch @StradeBianche - one of the coolest races on the calendar! Good luck to all the dudes racing... looks like it’s gonna be epic!
Rainy weeks: when professional cyclists become amateur meteorologists...

Having the honor to race in the @Amgen @AmgenTOC in the jersey of @usacycling National Champ in front of my family, friends, and US fans would mean the world to me. Praying 🙏🏽 we get an invite! Myself and @AquaBlueSport will not let you down! #AMGENTOC https://t.co/xnM3p77UyC
That was a seriously tough day out there. Raced with 2 buffs, a thermal jacket, and leg warmers and never even felt warm! Whole team was awesome, proud to get up there in what’s always a really hard race! https://t.co/mrWMlPQeX8
So, SO happy for this guy!!! @MichaelValgren is one of the friendliest, coolest guys in the bunch. Love it when the good dudes win!!! 👏🏽👍🏽👊🏽👌🏽 Bravo buddy!!!! https://t.co/nBDeeFJ6wV
@TheJoeminator @NicolasFellay Most guys ride tubes yeah. I’ve experimented with tubeless in the past, but clinchers just work! It’s about 50/50 in the Pro peloton of training on carbon vs aluminum wheels now... I’ve ridden carbon the last 2 years.
@NicolasFellay Currently with tubes. They don’t make a tubeless yet. I would imagine we might see one some time this year.
Our training tires this winter are some of the best I’ve ever used. You can now get them here: https://t.co/vsg2bqIBgu  I ride the 28c - they roll like silk and grip like... really well! 😂 Give them a go!
We're lucky to have @Theflyingmullet on @AquaBlueSport this year. Classy rider, classy guy. Looking forward to more races with him this season! https://t.co/m6K9wZ3iCY
Blue on blue on blue I’ll never tire of this view 😍 @ Col d'Èze https://t.co/4kzh1l5xRK
@inrng I've always wondered this. I used to ski race when I was younger and as after becoming a cyclist and seeing everything we do for every millisecond of aero, I think there must be huge margin for gain in skiing... Like what about their boots? Buckles, straps, etc...
@GoZwift Is this the same narrator who did the Cervelo Test Team behind the peloton videos?!?!

@nealrogers @AbbyMickey haha, no heat here either. Just a fair interesting back and forth!
@nealrogers fair. Though still think tires much bigger limiting factor than brakes!
@nealrogers Nah, the tires can't make the turn so they go straight!
@nealrogers already: Rolland following a guy w/ conti, crash. Mollema following guy w/ conti, crash. Ok, Froome on conti, so not foolproof
@nealrogers Disagree. One word: tires.
When it rains like this, tires make a big difference. @continentaltire is a huge advantage. #TDF2016
@inrng doubtful. He's trained in that position the whole season and considering he's a good TT rider, power is prob same as on road bike

@Jeukendrup (2/2) couldn't it have nothing to do w/ the timing and just be the increased pro intake?
@Jeukendrup (1/2)My question w/ these studies is why don't they have another group consuming the same drink at a diff time of the day?
Looks like I skinned a wolf in the bathtub. Actually just buzzed my legs after a month off. Does #noshaveNovember apply to legs as well?
@MIBicyclists @elgruponorte Sure! Followed you, so if you follow me back I can send a DM. Thanks!
@rorysutherland1 Sounds like 2016 is shaping up to be your year!!!
@nealrogers @gcntweet Dude! You guys missed the top cyclist Instagram out there! @michaelschaer without a doubt.
2016 season starts now! And I have a long way to go to get ready... Thank you @MyoKinematics for helping me prepare! http://t.co/B70l5WzsM3
@jfriel I would argue that it's a bit more of a bell-curve... Too much racing and one is too mentally fatigued to suffer!
@MarkCavendish I call it my "annual" run... Cause the first is usually the last as well

@CaleyFretz @nealrogers does the fact that two nations had two in the top 10 change anything? Phinney would have been the 10th nation...

@Scienceofsport not low at all considering the stage that preceded it!!!!!
@daniellloyd1 I have heard that with those rings on SRM the power reads 7% higher... Quite a lot
@veloclinic gotcha, thanks.  Keep up the good work. Like reading your stuff.
@veloclinic I did not mean to write like 3 times in that tweet....
@veloclinic ok, so would that mean like around like a 1 hr duration then? Like FTP-ish...?

Rest days 👍 https://t.co/r19Hfee0B6
@matmohoric @Ride_Argyle So this is why you're such a good descender???
@brentbookwalter haha, a win's a win I guess!

@BobJungels that was a seriously solid save!!!!!
Have to say I'm psyched to see my roomie here at #TOA15 @davidjtanner take his first pro win today.  Hard work and dedication pays off!!
@synergyPOH Of course and any time!!!  Love your stuff!!!!!
@jasongay Good quote, but based on his use of the word 'existential' I would guess that it was slightly edited... Ever seen his Twitter???

My fave quote from the Vuelta is from @WarrenBarguil on his climbing style - "I must attack, to sit in the wheels brings me no pleasure!"
Welp, chapeau to Contador - really brought a new meaning to the phrase "break a leg..."
@PhilippeGilbert Thanks Phil!  You made it a fun 3 weeks!!!!
I don't often look up from the wheel in front of me these 3 wks, but when I do, I'm amazed at what a diverse and beautiful country Spain is.

@Scienceofsport I guess I believe that Rominger (and co) maybe wasn't the most physiologically gifted and got a much augmented advantage...
@Scienceofsport So yes, he may have been faster than some of their times, but if they raced today I think they would be worse than 5% less
@Scienceofsport to that top level of climbing w/o doping...
@Scienceofsport I understand that it may warrant skepticism, but I also believe that many former doped riders wouldn't have been close...
@Scienceofsport @veloclinic One off, fresh efforts in training are sure to produce much higher values than races will...
@Scienceofsport @veloclinic Considering how much of a level above everyone he seems to be in most races, it seems like a realistic # to me..
So happy to hear that @Tannerputt took the win today @ U23 nats. Such a strong and good guy, so deserving. It's been a long time coming!

@jhaap I will!  Where are you at the moment??
Thanks so much to everyone for all of the help and support along the way. Couldn't have done it alone. But it's still a long way to the top!
Excited to finally announce that I will be racing for the BMC Racing Team for the next two years!  I cannot wait!!!
Tough day at Franco Belge...  Suffered like a dog, but felt good!
Good legs for this late in the season though, looking forward to a few more races w/ @BMCProTeam!
Enjoyed worlds today, but unfortunately it ended in a sprint! Finished somewhere top 20. Gutted for @gavinmannion - mechanical w/ 200m to go
Well, not a great ride by me, but that's bike racing. Some work to do this offseason, but first, on to the next one!
Just finished 2nd day of course recon with @natebrown0707. This TT will be HARD! Looking forward to tomorrow.
Great to see @GregVanAvermaet get 2nd though, next time I'll be there so I can help out in the finale!!
Not the best day for me in Wallonie.. Got caught up in a crash and as soon as I got back on the field blew up in the crosswind. Game over.
GP Wallonie starts in a little more than an hour!  Can't wait for my first Euro race with @BMCProTeam .. Should be a good one!
@AWarbasse yeaaahhh. Haha, morp circa 2006... "Are you going to prom??"
Solid TT for me today in Chrono Champenois. 6th at the finish, a little more than a minute off of Dennis. Good signs for Worlds!
Just saw that my Utah roomie @mathflueck was 3rd at the mtb World Champs!  Awesome job man!
@jhaap How big is your purse???
But now on to the next races. Can't wait for some more races with BMC and then the worlds. Should be a great rest of the season!
Tough day for me at TdL'Avenir. Cracked before the last climb and couldn't finish in the front group. @theboz91 on the other hand killed it!
Honored to be selected to represent the US at the World Championships. It's my 6th year in the program, but my first Worlds. I can't wait.
@devodirector Thanks Carp! Can't thank the team enough for the support.
@ErikSlack haha, dude, exact same mountains too...
Stage change: mass start hill climb. No Madeleine, no descent off the Telegraphe. 62 kms, 20K flat and then Saisies!
Hmmm. It's snowing on the top of the mountains we're riding up today. Sweet.
@DBKingdomsports thanks Mr. Brown!  Couldn't have been there w/o the boys help!
Finished 2nd group, 20 some seconds back, 30 seconds off the lead. Gonna be a solid next two days!!
Tough day. Made front group of 6 riders until 20 meters from the summit of the final climb. Exploded so hard, got dropped before the top!
I've raced in some interesting places, but this is definitely the first race I've started at a zoo... #tdlavenir #animalsonthebikeandoff?

Dude, @andrewtalansky - way to kill it at Tour de L'Ain today!!  You deserve that first pro win.
Solid day here in Utah, with Mr. @brentbookwalter taking 2nd place! Great to see!  And the entire team made the front split!
@gavinmannion I hear I may have been pretty competitive with you in that category...
Just so happens that the first time I get my lucky number 26 is in my first pro race...  Sick. http://t.co/GJntQob8
@LoganVB Nope, just Utah then Tour de L'Avenir!  Will you be here at all?
@NellyNelSoFr3sh Dude, always here to help!!
Super excited to start the Tour of Utah tomorrow, my first race as a stagiaire with the @BMCProTeam!  Should be a great one!
Awesome to see @bensharp13 &amp; his @usacycling girls tear it up &amp; win a medal in London.  Serious dedication and hard work went into that one!
Dude... @taylorphinney - such an impressive ride!  So close man.  Now just #killtheTT
Breakfast time w/ @Ty_Magner and @TheMattLipscomb .... http://t.co/61dotaky
And thank God, my legs are slowly but surely returning...  Might be able to pedal again by the end of this stage race!
Good to see good people crushing it today - @BobJungels in Aosta and @BontragerLS here at Cascade!
For every high there is a low...  I just didn't realize I could get so slow...
And just so happened that the guy who won the stage that day got 2nd today....  Crazy.
Cool watching today's stage in the tour - did the Croix de Fer and finished on La Toussuire during a race in 09 w/ Tejay and @taylorphinney
Used to have dreams that I forgot to do my homework.. Now they're all bike, like my last: dreamt I forgot to bring my bike back from Europe

My rear skewer snapped with my first pedal stroke and I went over the bars...on the start line. Quite comical. Thx BontragerLS for the pace!
Great race out there today at U23 nats. Good to see some great guys on the podium - congrats @robdavidbush @Tannerputt and @gavinmannion
@DeeDee315 He'll definitely be one of them!
Today is the RR.  Looking forward to @HincapieDevo lighting it up again!
Awesome riding by @HincapieDevo in last night's crit. Amazing finish by @Ty_Magner for the win. Most exciting race i've seen in a long time!
My family and myself at the awards.  Thanks for your support guys! cc: @JKWarbasse http://t.co/1vlAqinY
4th in National Champs TT. Utterly exhausted. Don't think I could have gone one second faster. Hope to be a bit more recovered for Saturday!
Honored to be a part of this @usacycling team!
The most stressful day I've had on a bike, and I wasn't even wearing the jersey. @JoeDombro brought it in for the overall win. #amazing
And I don't think there is a more deserving rider in this peloton than @JoeDombro to be in Pink.  Most dedicated athlete I know.
Pulled off and it was only him and two others.  He proceeded to obliterate everyone and win the stage as well as reclaim the GC lead.
Biggest day I have ever had on a bike. 5600 kjs, 310 norm, GiroBio stage 9. Rode as hard as I could at the foot of the Gavia for Joe.
We may be 8 days in, but the Baby Giro begins today - 5500 meters of climbing with a mtn top finish on the Gavia. Baby? #ithinknot
@lawsoncraddock taking the deathmarch to a new level. I don't think I know anyone else who could literally ride themselves into the hospital
Oy. All day break, dropped everyone, but caught on Terminillo. Set a little tempo for @JoeDombro and then he WON the stage! And got PINK!
9th in the TT here today at the GiroBio.  A little less than I was hoping for, but not too bad all the less...
@SuperEagless really?  What's his name?  And track cycling?
We are going to have an amazing squad for the GiroBio though, that is for sure!
Awesome one day yesterday, Team USA was strong! Legs were really good, but after a massive effort in last K, I blew up hard w/ 400M to go!
@fleetfoxes playing on the plane...  Good choice @AirFrance.
Hahaha #greatesthashtagever RT @natebrown0707: Nothing like waking up at 4 am to catch a flight. #hawkeshasnosoul
A little sad I'm not in Greenville today for USPro. Can't wait to hear good news from @ghincapie @brentbookwalter, Tejay, and @HincapieDevo!
Also great to see @tejayvangarderen and @brentbookwalter do so well in the USPro TT... Now just take the win in the RR!
Can't wait to see @taylorphinney absolutely kill it tomorrow. Huge congrats on making it over those mountains man!!!!
@jhaap As am I.  Can we hang out?
@WalkerT_Rowdy 'til when?  Cause @taylorphinney I would be down!
@WalkerT_Rowdy @taylorphinney Haha, definitely. And I think the #entourage needs to reunite soon. #synergy? #nope.
@blebowitz Nah, in southern France, in the Pyrenees...  Are you in France??
Oddly enough, I have gotten stitches twice in my life. Both happened to be in the same small hospital in the same small town in France.
@sarahvizachero haha, I so will. I live vicariously through your and @marciahamelin 's facebook photos... Get me through some tough times..
So I didn't win. I got 5th on the stage and overall. But I didn't leave empty handed. I leave with newfound confidence that I CAN win!
While supertucking. Sit on side of road in dismay, get back on bike, get passed by yellow and one guy, ride ass off, finish 5th.
Drop everyone there, except for 2 to help in last 20K. Put minute into yellow by top. Decide to hammer descent. Wheel slide out at 70 kph
Come back again, snowing at the top. Bomb down descent. Group of 15 at bottom of final climb. Attack, drop everyone, bridge to breakaway
So 30K in I crash on a sharp corner when the peloton was strung out in the crosswind. Come back. 2nd big mtn, I flat when attacks are flying
Best and worst day of my life on the bike. (Be prepared for a bombardment of tweets) Told my roommate last night I was going to win GC today
@SuperEagless haha, yeah, now that's what I'm talking about!
@BobJungels way to kill it today! Congratulations my friend, you deserve it. Good luck tomorrow and keep that jersey at the finish line!
Today went pretty well, 6th at the finish with an uphill sprint...  Still a few breakaway guys up the road. We'll get this tomorrow.
@TheMattLipscomb dude, me too! They have been coming in handy, huh? Hope you crushed that TT today!!!
Stage 3 of Isard on tap. Col de Portet d'Aspet. Ready to kill it. Been channeling my inner climber this week and it has been working so far!
@taylorphinney Kill it this next week dude... (As in, suffer your @ss off) And maybe find a girl in Milan? Extra motivation for the mtns..
@SuperEagless Where are you working dude?
Happy mother's day to the greatest mother of all @JKWarbasse - thanks for all of your support!  Miss you mama.
@WalkerT_Rowdy No? Should I look it up?  That last song you tweeted at me was sick!  Listened to it about 35 times...  No joke
Precedes to ask me how many watts I was doing... Then tells me how many he puts out in a sprint.  Man is a #legend.
So I am hammering through a TT interval, turn right and someone jumps on my wheel. Killing it, don't drop them, turn around, it's Cipollini.
@WalkerT_Rowdy @taylorphinney just went H.A.M. on some prologue!  Am I right??
Oh my gosh.  @taylorphinney just seriously crushed that.  Seriously praying that you win this dude!
@JoeDombro What the heck has gotten in to you?!?  You're gonna win the damn Tour of California!
Diggin' the photo RT @cuzzmayne92: It was an afternoon out in #Lucca with @larrywarbasse! You are great company buddy! http://t.co/XRKMcAK1

@ghincapie Haha, thanks man...
Been climbing for 30 mins at a bazillion percent and this road shows no signs of relenting...  Oaf. http://t.co/rqtzT8XO
@taylorphinney just rallyin' the fulvia through the tuscan hills...  #likeaboss http://t.co/SHSSN4bq
Watching Tour of Turkey on Eurosport and so pumped to see @romainbardet killin' it right now!  Awesome riding man!
Bad day to forget a baselayer. Got so cold, had to stop and have mech and director put my rain jacket and gloves on me. Hail and rain, again
Unfortunately things haven't gone so well for the team, as we're down to only 2 riders.. It's lonely in this Vacansoleil camper w/o the boiz
Mega steep climb to the finish today... Suffered like no other, but made the first "group"-the Italians went 1, 2, 3 alone in front of us...
Wooo!!!  Yeah @taylorphinney and @BMCProTeam!  Congrats guys!
Young Anders likes his food... http://t.co/q37Xyjx9
Hahaha “@SuperEagless: "More Money more problems" is what the pastor said today in church.  lol in my case its "No money too many problems"”
@JoeDombro I know dude!  And definitely see you there man!  But I better see you lighting it up on tv in California first!!!
So wish I could do more than follow Amstel on twitter...  Looks like @romainbardet and @alex_howes are crushing it.  Seriously #inspiring
So yeah.  Rough day for me, but great for @usacycling.  @theboz91 and @joshuaraspberry rode absolutely amazing.  Great job guys.
Finally stopped shaking and went on the attack on Col du Tilff, but front wheel exploded mid-climb... Chased back but group had shattered.
Oy. That might have just been the coldest day of my life.. Hail, driving rain, and freezing temps. Had some violent shakes most of the race.
Liege-Bastogne-Liege U23 today. 5th place last year, looking to move up a few spots... Preferably 4...
@tmasotta it only toasts one side!!!
Hey @ghincapie, forgot to tell you - took my knee warmers off flawlessly mid-race yesterday... Thought about how proud you'd be...
Phew, seriously HARD day at Recioto today.. Probably hardest parcours I've done for a 1 day. No win, but not bad @theboz91 5th, myself 8th!
@romainbardet thanks man!  We'll see how it goes!  Looks like you have been having some great rides this year!
Tomorrow is Recioto though, looking for some redemption from last year!
Good to see the boy is back!
Dang, well, unfortunately a crash for me 2K out from the base of the climb... Wheel effed and race over - @theboz91 front group though!
Pre-race cuddle sesh w/ @RyEastman and @theboz91 ...  Giro del Belvedere tomorrow! http://t.co/RIw87tG1
Rough. Almost to airport, find out French air traffic controllers are on strike.. No more flight to Italy today. @theboz91 solo another day!
Hit it with 600 meters to go, but couldn't gap the sprinters... So 9th in the end.  Seriously good ride by @BobJungels for the overall!
Finally feeling back today! Hit it on the first cobbled climb of the day and a 13 man split formed... We stayed away to the finish 70K later
@hanrobb Ahahaha wish I could!!!  Ohh gosh...
Been in Belge since last night...  And dang it feels good to be back!
@cuzzmayne92 Yup, you just plowed my mind.
@jackieblackaday Pretty sure that is totally independent of being preggers.. I feel the same way any time Morgan Freeman talks...
Legs seem to be really good though, so hopefully the mountain top tomorrow will be a different story...
Haha, well, first two days didn't go to plan!  Turns out, 2K is not my specialty, and got caught behind a massive pileup in finale today!
@hanrobb @jhaap I will one of these days!  I miss 1015!  Where will you both be this summer?
@WalkerT_Rowdy We're in Umag right now, but we'll only be here for a week!  How's Austria?  We need to meet up!
@phinneybeak Haha, ok, I'll go for it.  Some set button sufferin'.

Seriously tough day at Aosta. Went in the early break, dropped breakmates on the climbs, rode solo for awhile, but got caught with 6K to go

But the sad thing is I was just starting to feel the magic on the bike today...  Ohhh altitude.
Nice last ride in Boulder today with @Al_Loutit and @JoeLewis1989, complete with 2 coffee stops.. Now off to Europa for another good block!
@ghincapie What?!?  I thought that was against the rules?  And we get crap for eating froyo...
Woooowww.  Insane last TT.  @CadelOfficial is a beast!  Awesome day for him and @BMCProTeam!! Amazing to watch!
Pretty sweet stage to watch in the Tour today.. Now I'm hoping we'll see @CadelOfficial smash them all up L'Alpe tomorrow! Good luck!
Now off to Boulder tomorrow for a nice block at altitude!  Really looking forward to it!
Got two super solid 5 day blocks in here at home, finishing up with some good time behind the moto the past coupla days thanks to @nlicht!
@lawsoncraddock Is that seriously a real code?!  That IS awesome.

Thanks everyone for all of the birthday wishes!!  It has been a good one!
@tkarnes1 thanks man, you too!  Way to represent @hincapiedevo, you were riding strong!
But now, a much needed break for a bit. Going into hiding for awhile, but come August and September - watch out!
Haha, also didn't help that someone ran into my derailleur 5K in.. Had about 4 gears for the other 160K.. Avg cadence probably around 40 rpm
Seriously hard and hot race at nationals today. Tough racing solo against 3 strong teams. Put in lots of digs, but eventually came up empty.
@sarahvizachero spotting? http://lockerz.com/s/113778420
On the other hand, @natebrown0707 seriously smashed it today.  Very impressive ride, good job man!
Ok day on the TT bike today... 5th at U23 Nats. Not what I was hoping for, but can't complain when I've had great form since January..
Mama nature decided to turn the broiler on in the south. Pretty sure it is at least a bagillion and a half degrees outside right now...
@robthesquire Dude...  What the heck.  You seriously have like the best minute man at nats.  Who made this start list?
Hey @marciahamelin and @sarahvizachero -Just an fyi.. You guys are leaving work early one day when I come to NYC cause we are going shopping
Now if only I could turn the consistent top 10s overall into consistent wins...  One of these days!
Well, if there was a consistency award over multiple stage races, I'd say I'd be in contention for it. Sitting 7th overall at Fleche du Sud.
@theboz91 Please tell me you are joking about riding a tandem...
Serious suffer fest at Fleche du Sud today. Team USA rode great. Believe I finished 8th, should put me top 10 overall.
RT @taylorphinney: A 15 yr old girl with terminal cancer has made a bucket list. 1 of her wishes is to trend on Twitter. RT #alicebucketlist
@louderjeff It amused me too.....
Then @lawsoncraddock went down in the final turn with 200 to go...  So no bonus seconds for us, should have stayed 4th and 5th GC.
Well, we went for it today in Berlin. After 35K of attacking, got in the breakaway, but lost the time bonus sprint for 3rd on GC..
We also have 5th and 7th on GC.  Got some time to make up!
Well, looks like I'm 4th on GC after finishing 10th in the TT. Not as good as I had planned...
Badass riding by Team USA in Berlin today, Rathe and I make break, Lawson bridges up, 3 of us drive 16 man group, Rathe sprints to 2nd!

Sometimes you just have a bad day... Today was one of those days. On a brighter note, @robthesquire smashed it for 4th.
Solid day at Ronde L'Isard. @usacycling U23 rode great, 2 in the break, and guys covering every move. Ready to tear up the mtns tomorrow!

Wow, pretty sure the guy who just won the giro stage has only been riding a bike for 3 years...  Not bad.
Well, for the first time in my life, I just got all my hair buzzed off.  Still trying to decide whether that was a good idea....
Dang. Past week of riding in the south has been like riding in a toaster with the humidity knob turned up to 90%.  Dyyying...
Reeled in.  Dang.  Now Sella is on the attack, and probably riding an extra kilometer by swerving from one side to the other...  Seriously?
Watching the Giro...  Go Matthias!!!

@lawsoncraddock Good luck man!  Smash it!
On my way back to the U.S. after a successful trip to Europe. Looking forward to getting back to work with @ghincapie and @cbutler88!
On a brighter note, @taylorphinney is back!!  Nice ride man!
Still finished somewhere in the top 10...
Pouring rain, crashed in a switchback...  Took over a minute to get a kink out of my chain and up and going again. Heartbreaking.
GP Palio del Recioto, away all day, dropped breakaway companions on final climb, 50 second gap with only 5K downhill to the finish.
Probably my best and worst day in my life on a bike today.
http://yfrog.com/h417xbczj
Rode away with 3K to go to get 3rd on the stage and moved to 7th overall on Final GC.  Getting closer!
Awesome help from @usacycling national team today. @robthesquire and @gavinmannion smashed it on the strade bianche to keep me up on GC
And thanks everyone for the kind words!!
Pretty good day on the bike for me today. 5th at L-B-L U23. Need to work on my sprinting legs a bit though...
@taylorphinney @louderjeff Gelato?!?!  That is not part of the Jeff diet...
Great article. Here is a kid with a good head on his shoulders. A conversation with Andrew Talansky Part I http://t.co/SunFUjo via @velonews
@lawsoncraddock Apparently poor spelling as well...
Good day for me on the bike...  3rd in this morning's TT in Tryptique Monts Chateau and 8th in the afternoon's road stage.  Feelin' good!
Accidentally ran into 3days of DePanne on our training ride today! Nice to see @BMCProTeam @chrisbarton88 @manuelquinziato and @Mickeyhavoc
@cuzzmayne92 How did the race go today?
Great day for a bicycle ride here in Croatia. Tough course + wind=good day. Front group at the end. @lawsoncraddock smashed it in the break!
Amazing help from @usacycling U23 riders today, perfect position on the climb, unfortunately didn't move up more!
Moved up to 7th on GC today in the Istrian Spring Trophy. Felt awesome on the climb, unfortunately cobbles on top didn't go so well...
Nice day in Croatia again and 10th again. 500 meter cobbled climb to the finish. Looking forward to the mtn top finish tomorrow!
10th in today's prologue at the Istrian Spring Trophy...  Not psyched, but satisfied. Good start to the Euro season.
Tried to pull a page out of @mmadion 's book by saving half of my burrito...  #impossible

Solid last meal in the US before headin' to Europe. Chipotle in the airport?  Sick... http://yfrog.com/h7z9duvj
Really excited for today's #pn finish. Could be a @usacycling talent throwdown with @brentbookwalter @andrewtalansky and @tvangarderen88 !
Also, loading up the iPod for the trip. Any recommendations? Anything but country, but maybe more on the chill side...
Pouring rain and 40 degrees Fahrenheit = not ideal riding weather. But, considering I head off to Belgium tomorrow, I better get used to it.
For some reason, I do not believe I have ever paid less than $5 for froyo...  Even after the lady gave me 2 oz. free today...
Another question I have been pondering...  Is Contador a vegetarian now??  #dyingtoknow
Spent the day pondering why there was a dance for the rain and not one for the sun, because I was in grave need for one.  Not anymore...
Our ride to the airport... In the back of a pickup truck. Leavin' the DR in classic DR style http://yfrog.com/h7eomcpj
After spending 100s of Ks on the front this week, and for racing without a disc and with a front box rim, I guess 4th in the TT isn't bad..
Rough roads made for a rough race today. 3 flats, 2 in the last 10K, but still got same time as peloton. Not great, but it happens
On board en route to the Dominican Republic!  Psyched to get some sun and the 2011 racing season underway! Should be good...
@jaredemerson Haha, thanks man!  And, sorry about the bike!  I'll get you back...
For those who didn't know it already, I think @andrewtalansky confirmed he was a beast today at T of Med... Nice job dude.

On my way home from a great week of training in Tucson. Didn't have the warmest weather, but tons of good training partners!

Back in Michigan after a good hard week of training in Tucson.. Winter weather riding for 2 more weeks, then Redlands.. Ready to crush it

@iggyjsilva who goes to the gym dude?  You're a cyclist man, c'mon, not a weightlifter...
Some people found it funny to floor it through the slush piles on the road while passing me today. Got covered in pounds of slush. Sweet.
