I have been warning about this for months.  The only effective intervention is restoring sanitation on the streets. https://t.co/7DU2qdQpDL https://t.co/S1WHGhzdbz
I made a warning in February: the homeless crisis puts Los Angeles and other major cities at risk of norovirus, rickettsial infections, and typhus plague outbreaks. Today there are reports that a typhus outbreak has already begun:¬†https://t.co/OFJxjMGpo7¬† ‚Äú https://t.co/XGeDVqCAh7
Not endemic to San Francisco so much.  We have Recketrsial reservoirs in Southern California that‚Äôs why I knew it was inevitable. https://t.co/tokfcUNN9Z

Please be warned. https://t.co/OFJxjMGpo7
I categorically predicted this. It HAD to happen. We have a breakdown of civilization in Los Angeles. And it will get worse. This morning Pasadena announced officially an epidemic in that city. https://t.co/nWVSpbjzy9
This is awful and the only possible containment is to restore sanitation throughout the city.  The basic needs of civilization are being ignored. https://t.co/gEbbCa7A86
