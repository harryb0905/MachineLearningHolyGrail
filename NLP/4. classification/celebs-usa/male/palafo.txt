@tractivepenis I changed that tweet since they were all of course flawed and caught in historical contexts. He is given credit for his role in independence and not staying on to become a tyrant. Do you think the US would be a country without him? Would that be better? Maybe. I prefer Lincoln.
@tractivepenis Many used to say* Washington was a great president. Unanimity breaks down as you go down the list from there. (*And strong dissents about even Washington in mentions above! Would U.S. exist without him? Unknowable!)
@tractivepenis Fair
@PonyCarl Well, sure. That's what makes this country great.
This reminds me of when everyone called Jan. 1, 2000 the start of the millennium, a mathematical impossibility. (There was no year zero.) But we celebrated using the popular odometer reasoning. All human calendars are arbitrary anyway.

@jameskarst Ha
Of course, hardly anyone, including presidents and members of Congress, make this distinction. The popular name has stuck.
Many years ago, Congress did regularize most federal holidays to land on Monday and give federal workers a long weekend. Many states and employers followed suit.
Confusing matters, Washingron's actual birthday is Feb. 22, which is Friday.
New York and other states observe separate days honoring Washington and Lincoln. Other states recognize Presidents' Day. Congress never officially changed the name, contrary to many reports out there.
It is known popularly as Presidents' Day, plural possessive. Either is now allowed under NYT style depending on circumstances.
Futile public service announcement: Washington's Birthday is the official name of the federal holiday observed today.

@RyanOtey It's actually journalism to find the facts about everyone, and much has been written about Covington and the Israelites too. That's a lot of digital ink for an incident in which nobody even got punched, let alone killed, but whatever.
His statements about his war service have ranged from confusing ("Vietnam times") to misleading ("in theater"). He's a veteran, but he's not a Vietnam veteran. https://t.co/699XeG8CMc

@nfltexanchick @CNN But again:  this correction is just about what he told NYT reporters; he did not tell us he was a Vietnam veteran. And some were questioning whether he was a veteran at all, so we got his record. I am interested in other clips and reports, so thanks for pointing these out.
@nfltexanchick @CNN He also slips in "times" after Vietnam in that clip, if you listen. I certainly understand the confusion.
@nfltexanchick @CNN No mention of Vietnam in the Fox clip. https://t.co/Wwf2z1kxuo
@nfltexanchick I don't work for The Washington Post. The NYT showed their role in this video yesterday: https://t.co/hEDoAnNbcV And there may be more. The Post did have a column that talks about them today, I think.
@nfltexanchick @CNN Where in that story? It's a dog's breakfast of stuff.
@nfltexanchick @CNN If you have a clip of him saying it, I'm interested.
@nfltexanchick @CNN Correcting a factual error we published is not "defending" anyone. It's correcting our mistake. If you have actual instances where he claimed to be a Vietnam veteran, I am interested. Just don't spread false information.
@nfltexanchick @CNN I am speaking here only about his interviews with us. I can not vouch for every word he has ever uttered, and that transcription error is on @CNN. It should be fixed.
@nfltexanchick @CNN If you listen to the CNN video, the transcript is wrong. He says "Vietnam time veteran," a phrase he also used with us on Sunday. We did find that confusing, which is why we requested his record.
@shoutingboy @legallybae I don't think they can fit on the Senate floor but don't know for sure. She controls the House chamber.

We've updated the correction on Nathan Phillips's military record. The "Vietnam veteran" error came from the march organizers, not him.

@lamblock Your complaint may be with the school and diocese. We wrote our first story after they made their statements ... It seems likely they had talked to the chaperones beforehand. We continued reporting into today as more videos emerged and students finally came forward.
@QA_NJ Skepticism is healthy
@AmPowerBlog The statements by the diocese, school and March for Life made it newsworthy. We made every effort to reach the students on Saturday. Today we have a fuller picture and provided it.

@calebmcwilliams Don't confuse an effort to draw people out with emptying a notebook. And I am not a reporter on this. I am in the back of a car in a snowstorm.
@trump_democrat Our story is accurate
@BuckyKatt They had one job, as the saying goes. This includes keeping their charges out of the news.
@calebmcwilliams I understand and appreciate your viewpoint, which fits the known facts. If the kids are misunderstood they should come forward. They have not as yet. So there we have it. But I will not apologize for due diligence.
Mac the Moose, a 32-foot-tall sculpture in Moose Jaw, was the tallest moose sculpture in the world for more than 30 years. Then one was erected in Norway in 2015. At nearly 33 feet, the shiny moose named Storelgen bested Mac for world bragging rights. https://t.co/vgra5BZlAv

@calebmcwilliams I did not say it was unimportant and I certainly think strong emotions are understandable. I worry about the next incident somewhere that will be worse

@GwilymMcGrew He says they approached his group and they blocked him when he went up to defuse the situation. Watch all the videos, see his statement. They were apparently unsupervised. Where were the teachers?

@ID_Theft_Lawyer Oh, I think we need to report on the stupidities. People want to know what the facts are. And I was referring to totality of the coverage. The NYT stories were measured and perhaps did not deserve to be lumped in with the critique.
@Jonesnforthetr1 Warren is not a Republican.

@powellnyt That said, I think the general point that indigenous people have a wide mix of views is worth everyone remembering. The views in the Maggie Astor piece are rather nuanced, I thought. Age-old tension between what you can say in a headline and what you can say in paragraphs
@Kinniska Yeah, it's definitely mixed, like any groups of people. I think our story makes that clear. Headlines tend to focus on one element.
@powellnyt In fairness, she's linking to a followup article, not the one I just posted, which talked to a lot more people.

@Zach_Team We've written about them.
@NatAllard We are constantly revising and editing stories and headlines for a whole variety of reasons. Only some rise to the level of needing a note or a correction. It's simply a matter of workload and time available, given the thousands of words and hundreds of URLs we publish daily.

@IRaiseUFacts Hi Robert. Nice to meet you.
@IRaiseUFacts That isn't really what that was about, but since there's confusion, I've deleted it.

@forrestmunden @NoahCRothman I probably have a strange idea of fun.
@forrestmunden @NoahCRothman Generally speaking the news outlets you name present factual reports though they do through errors show flaws and occasional bias (not always in one direction). They also publish a variety of opinions across the spectrum. That is how grownups talk out their differing views.
@forrestmunden @NoahCRothman I read those as well as WSJ, National Review, Daily Caller, Breitbart, Reason and many others you probably have not heard of
@forrestmunden @NoahCRothman Personally, I read from a variety  of sources and points of view. It is a mark of intelligence and civilization to do so.

Here are the key tl;dr points of the investigation https://t.co/dd6nnEtrIz
"The Times’s findings raise new questions about Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents."
Trump's lawyer's full statement. https://t.co/A5b2Qyh9AW
Report builds on the work of Wayne Barrett, Gwenda Blair, David Cay Johnston and Tim O'Brien. "The Times’s investigation ... is unprecedented in scope and precision, offering the first comprehensive look at the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed ...a gilded life."
"What emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the 45th president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr. Trump has sold in his books, his TV shows and his political life"
So, looks like it was time to examine Trump's taxes again https://t.co/dhPxQhksuH

@irishinstinct But I have plenty of relatives and friends with alcohol issues and I am familiar with the patterns. Irish descent has nothing to do with it. You brought it up and started out vulgar like a troll. Be civil or buzz off.
@irishinstinct It’s not a criminal case. It’s a job interview for a lifetime appointment. Worth knowing the facts about his judgment and demeanor, no? Seems like there are unanswered questions. But it is not up to me. Just watching with an open mind and sharing information.
@irishinstinct I’m Irish. You’re saying we never touch a drop? Alcoholism is a scourge everywhere, including the Emerald Isle.

@3rdMoment That said I'm not sure that it matters, does it? Men across the political spectrum have been caught up in the Me Too revelations.
@3rdMoment I guess it depends what you mean by elite. Most of those writers were midwesterners, but they did come out of Harvard and other places.
@3rdMoment Wasn't condemning anyone, really. Just remembering a period in history when I was walking around the planet. I suspect some involved with National Lampoon, Porkys etc were young.
@3rdMoment so the audience bears no responsibility for what it rewards?
Kavanaugh Is Accused by a Third Woman of Sexual Misconduct https://t.co/JkzeOZq8UM
@ShnydaOne Not sure online comments like that get much credence. On the other hand, perhaps someone who experienced what she alleges would not have the healthiest relationships later in life. We'll have to see, I guess.
@sheltbumgarner I've been resisting it for days.
@ShnydaOne What jumps out at you?
It has been hard not to be reminded lately how the early 80s youth culture was so grotesque -- from Porky's movies to the "O.C. and Stiggs" stories in National Lampoon that celebrated drugs, drunkenness and "pulling trains."
So, that's a hell of a set of allegations. https://t.co/X0cN2B08Dw

In other murder news, this guy. https://t.co/HEmjxXIaYr
@KatzOnEarth @johnjcook My team does the more interesting murders. Readers are interested. We don't put them on the front page like the tabs, but they're news. We just published this, in fact: https://t.co/HEmjxXIaYr Bad idea to cover it?
@tfitzsimons @KatzOnEarth @johnjcook (One possible reason for that neglect in the case of Horton is that a small newspaper won a pulitzer for covering the furlough program and the case, and in the 1980s before the internet the big news outlets often ignored major stories broken by local papers.)
@tfitzsimons @KatzOnEarth @johnjcook I think all these cases that people try to promote for political purposes should be reported out. It does remind me of the Horton ads that elder Bush deployed to defeat Dukakis. Mainstream news orgs did not really examine the case in detail until very late in the campaign.
@KatzOnEarth @johnjcook You're entitled to your opinion. It was a cable news running story for a while before she was found. It has not gotten major promotion from us, nor was this story in the paper. But the president and conservative outlets have elevated it.
Category 4 now, going to reach Hawaii tomorrow https://t.co/AEVFIKlC94
@KatzOnEarth @johnjcook And if you're telling me you did not read a single story on this topic, then I guess I don't know how you know anything about it.
@KatzOnEarth @johnjcook And we think our readers are better off satisfying their curiosity about the facts of the case by getting it from us rather than some source with an ax to grind against immigrants.
@KatzOnEarth @johnjcook We cover plenty of crime from around the country. It happens that conservative media latched onto this just as we were publishing the latest break. Then the president talked about it, and Fox News ranked it higher than Cohen / Manafort. Politics aside, a young person was murdered

@alanwarms I think if one is going to be fair, you tend to err on the side of not accusing people of murder in big display type without more evidence than ICE has provided here (basically zero).
@alanwarms No, I do not agree it was misleading. He was detained by law enforcement while driving his wife, who was in labor, to the hospital. Anyway, have a great evening. I'm off to dinner and going offline.
@alanwarms Mobile app does seem to eliminate the summary in some views. Our headlines and other display type have to feed many internal and external platforms. It's too bad Twitter doesn't always show full context, but that's Twitter's problem.
@alanwarms There is no way any story can be completely understood from the headline. You're expected to read in deeper if you care. And even the headline alone here is perfectly accurate. ICE detains people it believes has broken laws; that is implicit. It's a law enforcement organization.
@alanwarms This is what most users of https://t.co/9hTS6j4Gf3 saw (which is most twitter users): https://t.co/GexmssTJ3O
@alanwarms See, it's right there, totally retweetable: https://t.co/RgaHxr1RwF
@alanwarms Anyway, go back to my original tweet. The full card appears on twitter. Under the headline and photo, visible on twitter: "the agency said he was wanted for honmicide" https://t.co/PbGVmOwiA4
@alanwarms We disagree. This is not a debate. Have a good evening.
@alanwarms Actually, we can see how many people click through and how far they get in the story. You seem to think you are informed for someone who did not do so. I excerpted the relevant paragraph for you.
@alanwarms His lawyer said the paperwork from ICE does not mention homicide. “According to the family, he has no criminal history in Mexico, and we did our own search through Mexican channels and we didn’t find anything under his name.”
@alanwarms Nothing hidden. It's in the story. Try reading.
@PhineasZest For example https://t.co/EUSI35mMZo
@alanwarms https://t.co/EUSI35mMZo
@PhineasZest Sure. If true. Many details in there. Thanks for reading.
@alanwarms You seem to assume that means he's guilty of "homocide." In any event, the mother was not wanted for any crimes, was she? Or the baby? This was a health emergency.
