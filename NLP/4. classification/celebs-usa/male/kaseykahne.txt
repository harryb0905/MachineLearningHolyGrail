Really glad to see @MichaelAnnett in victory lane today @DISupdates It’s been along time coming for the first win. Way to keep after it @JRMotorsports

@Krossharley I didn’t realize that. Good to know thanks

A car high five I think he called it 🤚🏻😂 https://t.co/ruAeAuhFZQ
Spent some time with the awesome people @GREATracing yesterday. I hate to see our 14 years together come to an end but we had some great times together from sprint cars to cup cars to foundation events. Thanks for everything!
End of an era yesterday. Gonna miss seeing @DaleJr at the track every weekend but know we’ll still be seeing each other 🚲 🍺 the entire garage and fans reaction to him yesterday just shows how much he’ll be missed #Appreci88tion
Congrats to @MartinTruex_Jr and the 78 team on the championship and one hell of a season. Enjoy it. You deserve it 🍺
That was fun to watch! Great job @WilliamByron and @JRMotorsports on the Championship. @Elliott_Sadler @J_Allgaier @DanielHemric gave it a heck of a run as well
Nice work @CBellRacing great season! 👍🏼
Well I started the final race weekend of the year with a smile. While putting my left shoe on in dark closet I felt something. Pulled shoe back off and Tanner left me two pretzels 🥨 😂

Thanks you. If I lift he does it to me on next restart. That's how this sport works https://t.co/28PnWV1h39
Wasn't trying to show nothing. Had my nose under him. When someone gets there nose under me I go high so we don't wreck https://t.co/98RSyoX5Ti
You're an idiot. Watch the race when a car gets his nose under the other guy he goes high. If he doesn't they wreck. https://t.co/JSk2OEEesh
You should never lift in that situation. Other guy should run outside groove, that's why it is there https://t.co/KFanSn2xxr
Got nose under 6 at start finish, he held me down to turn 1, then drove in hard to bottom hoping to get me to lift. I didn't lift, crash
