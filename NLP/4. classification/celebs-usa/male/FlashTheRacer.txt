@VibeMagazine I’m not talking about this anymore but this woman is FATAL ATTRACTION! 🎤
@daRealDJ1Hunnit In the end he will get that W with her serving time. The last laugh is the best one.
@daRealDJ1Hunnit Exactly. No one should be hitting anyone.
@djeTeygen @VibeMagazine She mad she can’t use him anymore trust me bro.
@djeTeygen @VibeMagazine She is very over possessive than man couldn’t even say hi to other women or look at him. Trust me I know her history really well. Won’t state to much  🤫 this is me. She started off from IG is all I will say and poor Bow hooked up with the wrong one from IG. I saw it coming smh!
@IAmSteveHarvey @NFL I love ya Steve you did great hosting the honors @nfl @TheNFLHonors @nflcommish please bring him back for years to come. He did really great. https://t.co/BTDgSYdCxT
@djeTeygen @VibeMagazine Clearly and her face clean as a whistle. So who’s the victim?
@VibeMagazine Bow is the bigger man stop bashing him. I saw this ignorance coming. I called this crap from last year. She even blocked me on IG for calling her out months and months ago.
@trudy_sewell @VibeMagazine She needs to let it go. Bow been over her living his life.
@djeTeygen @VibeMagazine Because the police said they couldn’t determined who started the incident so they both got arrested. But I know the real who started it trust me smh.
@djeTeygen @VibeMagazine @smoss Bow bro I warned you on IG months ago. She even blocked me on there for warning you. Smh. I know you remember. Hate this had to happen during Super Bowl and she should’ve thought about Shai I know she not gonna look at her the same anymore. Crazy stuff.
@GetItBrooks @VibeMagazine Really is that something to brag about who won? It’s pure ignorance but some say they hate drama but indulge in drama smh.
@VibeMagazine I saw it coming she’s a clout chaser and never really loved Bow. I feel she initiated contact but don’t quote me. She is one of the reason last year Bow had a lil break down. Some of these women from social media a trip. Good luck to you both I will be 🙏🏽

@vitaminwater I can do this.
I could do this #nophoneforayear 100K @vitaminwater would give me more time to focus on more important things and focus more on my racing, family, friends and being more involved with being that Community Activist. It will be hard but I’m willing to do it. I got this #contest

@samanthalogan Great show i love it!
@samanthalogan @CWAllAmerican @ReallyCody I’m watching because of Samantha to keep it real. :)
@prettyhispanic1 Love this post.
@Dodgers Let’s hope there’s a game love you guys. https://t.co/kvyHWg1olx
@pyrosaxplayer @__GeorgiePorgie @RaideretteQT Thank you also!
@Dodgers We got this. #LADetermined https://t.co/nTYaZXsg1c
@Lakers Can’t wait!
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr It happens. Did he try to get sponsorships?
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr You too thx
@CWAllAmerican I already know the whole story but will stay hush 🤫 great tv series.
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers Lol.
@stealth_singer @ShawnMendes Can you answer why? I have my clue ;)
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr Like this!!!!! https://t.co/PhnkCoY1YZ
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr If that’s the case is anyone thinking Machado was at risk too. It’s a no win or lose situation. He needs to learn tip the edge of the bag.
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr You misunderstanding me his whole foot should not be on the bag it should be on the edge. I use to play baseball. Your side of the foot suppose to touch the side of the bag not on top of it.
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr PS the out was recorded way before the incident
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr Question why is everyone so concerned about this. How about Joe Theismann remember that? Or other players in the NBA that got choke held. My point Aguilar needed a lesson move your foot out the way. You saw he did it after Bellinger got out. It’s a lesson being thought.
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr Also how about when pitchers intentionally hit batters in the head is that not dirty?
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr A lot of players are dirty in sports even the one I’m in. But in my opinion Machado had every right to discipline Aguilar, bet he won’t keep that foot there anymore.
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers You said it better than me.
@Dodgers Small ball (put the ball in play) is just as good as big (Homeruns). Way to go @Dodgers 3 down, 1 to go.
@SportsNetLA ‘The Wild Horse’ I love it! ❤️
@DodgerfanDave @Dodgers @YasielPuig Thanks
@SportsNetLA @Dodgers @YasielPuig lol we all know he has an arm and can run would be interesting he is too good :)
@Dodgers @YasielPuig I wonder if Puig could have thrown hisself out at second base with his arm @Dodgers https://t.co/uQG4hAs5Sr
@Logan296 @billplunkettocr Not saying he played dirty how about when MIchael Jordan pushed Russell out the way in the NBA finals? I love Jordan tho. Sports is sports. Also Rodman use to push people for rebounds.
@kikehndez We understand &amp; love ya much!
@Steve_Perrault If this is how people feel it will teach Aguilar to move his foot next time he was on the bag too long after the out was recorded.
@billplunkettocr Secondly Aguilar whole foot shouldn’t be on the bag, it should be on the side of the bag. Third and foremost his foot was on the bag too long he already got the out. Machado didn’t do anything intentionally.
@Lakers @KingJames At Lakers I’m a new fan and would love a follow back please. Thank you.
@prettyhispanic1 Happy birthday!
@HobbesCarlota @Dodgers You are too ❤️
@Dodgers Still love you guys we still got this. Love you dodgers. https://t.co/eoV64ymQyf

@blacklightning Best moment but I’m 🤫
@blacklightning One question was that “Benjamin Crump” the lawyer from the “Trayvon Martin” case? If so you guys rock. I love this show.
@mxyeduh @Iokisodinsons I said that too to show when Iris was young @candicepatton
@mxyeduh Exactly what I were saying thought I was the only one who said this. She could pass for @candicepatton daughter big time.
@RachelSantschi @TayeDiggs @PYSNGR @KCWE_TV @kmbc @ABC Hi Taye loving the show you are all great. I will stay tuned every week. :)
@CWAllAmerican Wow i will be watching this show I love it.

You called it @realnedcolletti that we would be in the playoffs as division winners from a couple of months ago. This the happiest moment of my life, much respect to you. This helps ease some of my pain of my mom birthday tomorrow who died from cancer in 01. Love you &amp; @Dodgers
Hi @MLB did you guys ever consider ever breaking a tie for a division by the team that finished with a better record?

Yankees acquired McCutchen we still will meet them in the WS and win @Dodgers
Rip to Roseboro who died in 2002 &amp; Marichal was his honorary pallbearer and a speaker at his funeral which i think is so meaningful. Moral of the story if two foes can make up so can the world. Love you all good night. PS the 53rd ann. was like the 22nd of this month of the fight
Marichal hit Roseboro with the bat &amp; he had 2 have 14 stitches 2 close the gash on his head. So anyway I learned all this from granddad I know a lot of my history even though I weren’t born yet. But to sum this up Marichal became a @Dodgers in like 75 &amp; they both patchd things up
Yesterday I went to da cleaners da mgr. &amp; me spoked about how we 💙 our @Dodgers so much he askd me a bunch of trivia i aced it all. 1 of da ?’s was “Wat Dodger got hit by a bat in the head? I replied Roseboro by Marichal. He said yes ur a true fan, &amp; said da clean is on da 🏠😀
@Dodgers I love this. Happy birthday CT3! We all love ya!
@4everBrooke 😍🌹

@Dodgers @CedarsSinai I forgot Billy too.
@Dodgers @CedarsSinai Aw. Bless his heart. Always doing good things for the community.
@baseball_tacos_ @kikehndez You didn’t get the punch line KEVIN love is an expert at getting rebounds in the NBA so I used his name with rebound. Follow now? Keep up!
@baseball_tacos_ @kikehndez Never count your chickens before they hatch. It’s not over till the season ends speak to me then. We will catch you guys go Dodgers go!
If you all haven’t seen this do me a favor check it out. I’m binging it from Netflix @SomewhereABC great tv show. 😍💯

@YoungDrini Glad your safe.
*Warning very disturbing and you will hear the shooting at 2:39 time stamp.* This world needs to love one another and this crap needs to STOP! The shooter was a former MADDEN Champ. Smh https://t.co/FPrDrAjIoo prayers for all. This was a Madden Event. #PrayForJacksonville
Thank you... trying daily,
Thank you ❤️ https://t.co/VIVYXSogjX
@kikehndez Now go sweep the Rangers and D-Backs please love you guys.
@PettyAirJordan @TheRealJHair @getnickwright All of them are great but my theory is you have to win all mvp’s of every championship like mike did means he carried the team in all championships. All 6 he was the mvp.
For Munce he has been hitting homers ;) @Dodgers https://t.co/ChqLLbAd4h
@SportsNetLA Hi how are you guys doing. I noticed today the stations keeps freezing constantly i don’t know if you guys are aware of it. Love you guys and glad we won today. :)

Rip John McCain you will be deeply missed.
@CarrieKHutchens Thanks so much and respect to you for being a law enforcement officer. I have two family members on the force :)
With dizziness and all i still try to force myself to do things like going out. This last concussion really got me. But the man above deals all of our cards.
Not gonna lie lately been feeling like my days are numbered no lie. Praying to get stronger and this dizziness and other health probs go away 🙏🏽 When I die i hope everyone will take one of my post tweets i ever tweeted and live it. Love 1 another we are all equal. I love u all.

@YesssDrizzyBlue I’m sorry.
@YesssDrizzyBlue Happy late birthday! https://t.co/TRPQli3uDn
@YesssDrizzyBlue Have you been to game as of late?

@YesssDrizzyBlue Thanks ;)
@YesssDrizzyBlue I totally agree the Dodgers is my life i admit.
@YesssDrizzyBlue I’m to humble to express how they helped me through life truthfully.
@YesssDrizzyBlue Thank you so much same to you.

@YesssDrizzyBlue Yes like going to see my Dodgers :)
@YesssDrizzyBlue Truth!
@gutibg17 you said it right the bandwagon riders is not loyal. Me win or lose forever a Dodger fan.
@YesssDrizzyBlue Thanks so much. I can go out and stuff like that but can’t go in the race cars right now not competitive racing.
@YesssDrizzyBlue It’s a long process :(
@YesssDrizzyBlue Concussion months ago that still hinders me. I’m doing Cawthorne exercises.
@YesssDrizzyBlue Yup
@YesssDrizzyBlue I was speaking on my hlth tho.
@YesssDrizzyBlue Very true, glad you’re doing great.
@zukie2music Got to be a loyal fan :) 💙
@YesssDrizzyBlue I’ve had better days. But I’m ok.
@DennisSantanaRD @x_Th3_Truth_x @agentmo1 @TrueBlueDoyers @DustinNosler @Obrother4 @Dodgers @michaeljduarte Good to hear God bless!

@Dodgers Player of the game is this man :) https://t.co/WyLGy5mZ3D
@djsevere See I got you bro he couldn’t take my heat so he got out the kitchen. Lol I reblocked him also. Dodgers for life and DJ Severe for life. https://t.co/zI7aGswwGW
@djsevere @hankschulman @Dodgers I’m glad we got you @djsevere keep rocking bro forget these haters seriously. I love how u rock bro! I got u &amp; the dodgers back for life. How a reporter gonna tell you guys how to operate stadium games? PS to Hank I don’t see any police coming to the stadium saying turn it down https://t.co/ReNy5QR4Z1
@hankschulman @djsevere @Dodgers Dude go write for your company and stop worrying about our team the dodgers are you jealous your team can’t have a party? Dodgers attendance is number 1 in baseball every year. There go report that. PS I’m a die hard fan I will wait till you see this Hank then I’m reblocking u. https://t.co/mlSyIYDYKS
@djsevere Man F*** all you haters hating on DJ Severe get your high riding a**** off his tweets. He rocks the house and to those who said who has a DJ at a stadium maybe you need one because the Dodgers attendance is killing all u guys in attendance every year. Every stadium needs a party.
@kenleyjansen74 @Dodgers @GianniKJansen Happy birthday to the little one. :)
It’s times like this i wish I could time travel @LovelyLeo75 me and my niece would be at 9PM ;)
Rip to Aretha Franklin u will be heavily missed. I love u &amp; u will always be a part of all our life thru all dat gr8 music u made &amp; da human u were. Condolences 2 da family, friends, etc. this is a very sad day 😢 . This should be a holiday. #RIPAretha https://t.co/JiTjAslsUR
@hankschulman This ones for you @djsevere no one disrespects you or the Dodgers. https://t.co/s8OH2rUo0x
@djsevere I respect you as a human @hankschulman but I’m gonna block you for disrespecting the Dodgers and  our great DJ have a nice life. Some of you reporters disrespectful have a nice life. You mess with the Dodgers you messing with me your blocked now. https://t.co/UExQIjzuwB
@djsevere I’m one of your biggest supporters as well and will always defend you. 💙
@djrenrock @hankschulman @djsevere I agree he did nothing wrong without the music it’s lame. Him and @DieterRuehle is a one two punch so people need to stop hating on both of them. I’m a Dodger fan for life. I’m the kid in the pics. https://t.co/5Bu6koEvt2
@leftistideas @CBernal12 @DodgersLife12 @hankschulman @djsevere @Dodgers Thank you it’s a bunch of haters the music is just right and some of these people need to understand he not playing a whole concert all night and if he was I love it. Like Aretha rip said “R-E-S-P-E-C-T.”
@CBernal12 @hankschulman @djsevere @Dodgers Please I’m asking nicely stadiums do need music and we all as Dodger fans love DJ Severe we don’t need to hear each other to enjoy the music hyped up the crowd and the players. Thanks DJ I meant it from heart your doing good along with D.R. bro! Some people just hate #Dodgers
@djsevere No apologies needed you’re the best I’m a season ticket holder and you’re always banging out the great cuts. :) 💙 I attend a lot of the games. I bet Aretha rip is on the playlist this Monday another legend lost :( have a great day bro.
@Tuff_Overlord Pedro Baez was always cool just was in a lil slump. Love all the Dodgers💙
Prayers up for @leonys27martin https://t.co/Qv9BhDtlxF it’s was a potential grave infect. Thank goodness he is stable.

@zukie2music @Dodgers That’s the spirit. Go #Dodgers
@zukie2music @Dodgers Exactly stay true blue.
@Dodgers When anyone on this thread think you can lead a team 162-0 then we got a convo. Stay positive Dodger fans. We are Dodger fans for life no matter what.
@AsapRay13 @chwisg @Dodgers I said the earlier Ray here is the tweet: https://t.co/Zykht27Pl5 true Dodger fans needs to remain calm, I am.
@zukie2music @Dodgers Exactly then when we start winning again here goes this Zukie. smh people need to stay loyal! I am you are and a few do or die true fans. https://t.co/IaYFSskDKB
@PleasureEllis I’m so sorry read this bro, my biggest condolences. I see we both going through it 😢
@fyrmikey @fanddforevert @Dodgers We respect great Giants fans just like Vin Scully we are all humans with a team we love. Respect to you and I will follow you.
@PleasureEllis I need that my auntie needs a liver transplant and not doing well. Also my other auntie heart is leaking from one of her chambers. But i will be ok buddy. Love you, call you when i think my thoughts over. Got the bad news a few days ago.
@PleasureEllis Amen!
@OrelHershiser Thanks so much it means so much to me I love you i will never forget the hard work &amp; grind you did to take us through the World Series in 88 you did much for us as Dodger fans. 💙 You made my night :) PS I saw that whole series I lived it. Stay blessed!
@Joe_Davis &amp; @OrelHershiser Can a dodger fan of many many years get a follow back please it would make my night more than you will ever understand please I beg. The pics is me from a kid as a dodger fan I never traded the Dodgers. 💙 I love you both. https://t.co/DA0PEmh0zJ
@NaviaZRobinson You’re very intelligent you will do great.
@DodgerInsider Praying for him. He may have to avoid going to games in Colorado I’m guessing. The air is too thin out there this happened before in like 2012 in Colorado.
@BETMusic Prayers up to the queen of soul, we all love you and are praying strong 🙏🏽🙏🏽 a true legend.!
@thomas13355651 and you would have Lebron as an avi what about the other Lakers?
@thomas13355651 You’re a Laker fan all of sudden ok smh.
@Dodgers This to the fans Dodgers not you guys :) We need to worry about hoping we sign Machado &amp; Dozier in the off-season they’re awesome. I love them they are good! Some of u bashin them not cool. When Seager come back I figure they can put Seager at 3B, Machado SS, Dozier 2B, Turner 1B
@zukie2music @Dodgers Thanks my friend :)
@blancaxpacheco @Dodgers Yup!
@Dodgers Show your loyalty. Love you all! God bless! PS you are not the FO let them do what’s best. True fans stay aboard and not complain if they win or lose. In 1988 Joe Morgan of the SF giants hit a hr that beat us to keep us out the playoffs did I go off no. I’m still a fan. Pls 🛑
@Dodgers All of you need to stop saying fire Roberts, this pitcher shouldn’t be pitching. Blah blah blah and be grateful we have a team win or lose stay loyal and stop putting negative energy in the atmosphere. I love my Dodgers do or die. Then when they’re winning y’all all on the wagon&gt;
@Dodgers It’s cool win or lose I’m still a die-hard fan love you Dodgers. https://t.co/jhR9CenR5S
@Dodgers Repeat after me to the bashers “It’s ok we will win today.” You guys can’t expect our (Dodger Fans) team to win a whole season schedule get real love you all. Please stop it! https://t.co/ty16wMfzZi
@Dodgers Please stop bashing the Dodgers seriously take that elsewhere. Win or lose true fans stay loyal, I am. Instead of bashing use words of encouragement. We still got this there’s 162 games to a season some of you acting like this the last game. Please positivity I love you all. https://t.co/KrjyI3wAZ7
@YasielPuig @Dodgers We all love you &amp; the Dodgers, Puig. Congrats well deserved.

@Dodgers @Cut4 That would be nice he would be up there with former Dodger #30 Derrel Thomas. If memory serves me right he pitched before too. 💙

@Dodgers That pitch was off the plate :(
@Dodgers @YazmanianDVL08 @Cody_Bellinger @redturn2 @yungjoc650 Thanks so much love Wallpaper Wednesdays.
@OrelHershiser @Dodgers I lived it, saw it on tv.
I’m proud of my heart. It’s been played, stabbed, cheated, burned and broken but somehow still works.
There’s only (1) thing                       (2) do                       (3) words                       (4) you                            I love you.
Life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful.
Always trust your instincts, they are messages from your soul, they are the inner part of you that strives to make you whole.
A smile is the best makeup any female can wear.
The world is full of nice people. If you can’t find one be one! Good day!
People cry not because they’re weak. It’s because they’ve been strong for too long.
Wake up each day &amp; be thankful for life. Good Morning!
I believe that two people are connected at the heart, and it doesn’t matter what you do, or who you are or where you live; there are no boundaries or barriers if two people are destined to be together.
You don’t need someone to complete you. You only need someone to accept you completely.
@6BillionPeople Why do people keep thinking your grammar is important we are not writers. I’m not anyway. 🤦🏽‍♂️
@Connman_ @6BillionPeople I know wat u’re getting at. But in reality no one grammar is up to par unless you’re a journalist. We all write to instead of too. In a sentence like I love ribs too. It’s not necessary we’re not book writers or news writers. My grammar is very bad but nowadays that don’t matter
@MCHammer miss you Big Marc, @PleasureEllis &amp; crew bro! I wanna introduce u to @Joe_Davis who is a great broadcaster for my boys the Dodgers. He told an amazing story of how you got your name and who it was from. Hope you guys connect bro! PS he said nothing but the best about u https://t.co/Di8o3Y8wIN
@Joe_Davis Missed you during the weekend with @OrelHershiser You are the best broadcaster in baseball and with “BullDog” you guys make a great team. Thanks for repping #Dodgers I mean it from the 💙 you are filling in the big shoes just fine. Love ya both!
@BayAreaData @MCHammer The stolen base king “Rickey Henderson.” I see y’all coming back on us 3-2.
@MCHammer Much love bro you threw a great ceremonial pitch. But as you know I’m a big Dodger fan. Good luck to your A’s. Much love bro!
@mzprincesslove Congrats on the new bundle of joy to both you and Ray. 👶🏼
rip Charlotte Rae you will never be forgotten you taught us “The Facts of Life” &amp; “Different Strokes” you will never be forgotten. #ripCharlotteRae https://t.co/KdVhUifJXA
@zukie2music @el_yuly10 I know right? Kinda wish he was still with us.
@BryanAlan57 right one you photoshopped!
Great win @chaseelliott you deserved it! :)
@TheRealJHair I don’t know if you know this or not if you want to show percentage of your battery go to settings&gt;battery&gt;battery percentage slide to the right. Stay blessed bro!
@TheRealJHair I love the “MLB at Bat” app too :) Love seeing great Dodger news. Great win! 💙
@zukie2music We avoided the sweep 💙
@brucelee We will never forget you Bruce. Thanks for the post Shannon hope all is well.😀
@DodgersWayFS @Wittman7 In my opinion he needs to play everyday.
@BunkerKingRob @vSellinFSU @Dodgers I’m a big dodger fan buddy for years not trying to defend the guy. But when we all say ‘we’ it means us as fans not players. Much love bro! I’m gonna follow you.
@candicekp You are beautiful and women in this world rule...I’m very proud more women are superheroes on tv, etc. I love the equality and good to see. Next I’m waiting for the first women president some day it will happen. Keep up the great work C.P. love ya!🌹
@zukie2music @el_yuly10 Exactly it was very unprofessional and not right.
@zukie2music @Dodgers I admit we all as Dodger fans never troll another MLB social media page. We got more class. #Dodgers⁠ ⁠ for life #LADetermined 💙 https://t.co/iDO38aTirY
@TheXekutioner @JoJo33713 @Dodgers Lol 😂
@xcelesteex @Dodgers I’m the same with that I’m gonna follow you 💙
@nummorales Love your energy already bro! 👊🏼
@vSellinFSU @Dodgers Respect on acknowledging I’m not a bandwagon rider. As for D-Backs congrats on your team gn= good night!
@vSellinFSU @Dodgers Respect
@vSellinFSU @Dodgers Like i said no more talk till the season restart in October. Astros didn’t just win the WS tonight. We will be there in October GN sir!
@vSellinFSU @Dodgers I’ve been a fan since day one and I’m never leaving my Dodgers. I’m even an STH and will continue being one #Dodgers for life. https://t.co/IvrSb4Eowr
@vSellinFSU @Dodgers You said right now see all of you in October ;)
@nummorales @Dodgers Exactly dodger fan for life. I’m gonna follow you for this post buddy.
@Dodgers The post before this go to the Dodger fans who not sticking to our team. Stop it! Blue forever!
@Dodgers It’s ok this is just a regular season game. I still believe in my Dodgers for life. Stop bashing the team we love. #Dodgers for life I’m not going anywhere. In the WS we turning up and we will win no matter who we play 2018.
.@OrelHershiser Axford is the first Dodger to ever wear 88 so that should bring us good luck this year. It’s the year we last won the World Series. 💙
for this pure ignorance @el_yuly10 you will keep getting boo’d man! https://t.co/PDllmeIysX we have not forgotten!
No apology can ever be excepted for what he did last year to Darvish @el_yuly10 the rest of these people can accept your fake apology we know how you feel and you didn’t think cameras would catch you. All you got was a 5 game suspension this season? @MLB should’ve kicked you out&gt;
.@DieterRuehle my dad use to be a DJ pt. for KJLH he is now r.i.p. i know a lot of songs you play. He use to have crates of music. I remember “America”, “Bee Gees”, “Chicago” a whole lot more. I’m very eclectic when it comes to music thanks for being the best 👊🏼
.@DieterRuehle get it I hear you jamming “Toto-Africa” you are the best :)
1st off let me make this clear i’m not racist, nor do i discriminate against anything such as religion, sexual preference, gender, etc. Why was Al Campanis who made racist remarks which was very ignorant of him gets kickd out of @mlb but not @el_yuly10 we r gonna boo u 4 evr dude
I cast my vote @mlb for @DieterRuehle as the best organist in mlb. 💯
@DieterRuehle I remember that show. Morgan Freeman was in it. I watched it for “Spiderman” :)
I see @DieterRuehle rocking “In my Feelings” by Drake for Kiké love it.
@DwayneLow_ Her name is @Flaujae and i totally support her. Great raps and personality! Her mom raised her right.
@guyhayniac @taytayreynolds @HunterHayes Congrats!
@Joe_Davis Praying the day you give me a follow if not it’s totally understood. Salute to you! Keep up the great work.
@NiaNRiley All love Nia.

@Dodgers Can’t wait!
Prayers up @SCOOPDEVILLE to your dad; Kid Frost stay strong bro!
@NaviaZRobinson Always especially in my NASCAR stock car. :( try some artificial tear drops. They really help. Good luck.
@jamezmarvin Your head way in LF when I’m in the game. By the way that’s an anology. In other words you’re not paying attention.
@DennisSantanaRD @x_Th3_Truth_x @agentmo1 @Jacob_Rudner @TrueBlueDoyers @Obrother4 @PuigRobbedGG @jesseguzman80 Glad to read this go get ‘em! God bless! Go Dodgers!
@kapaya1234 Also this you didn’t know. Utley was sporting a "K Cancer" shirt in support of former Braves reliever Jason Motte's foundation dedicated to cancer research. Now man up and apologize.
@VinceSamperio @DodgersLowDown Exactly where is the suits 🤔🤔since we playing professional now.
@kapaya1234 while you’re at it i hope you noticed Utley was wearing this shirt for cancer awareness. So get off your horse and apologize to the Dodgers and Utley who did so much for this game and is retiring. You act like this was a game going on it was PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE man! https://t.co/TNZE83ELNv
@kapaya1234 Pathetic idiot you go down and do some batting practice then get back to me. Things to make you say hmmmm. How did you two become Braves announcers. Respect to the Braves &amp; fans they didn’t say it, you two have nothing better to say idiots did. PS wish Utley a happy retirement&gt;
@kikehndez Lol at Kiké love ya bro go dodgers go them announcers mad at your dad for no reason and in practice come on man practice? I’m dead https://t.co/YMl37SKv7T
@One_Jaded_Angel @TheRealJHair @DodgersLowDown He has the L A hat on and has a shirt in practice raising cancer awareness so these Braves announcers are idiotic. https://t.co/B9ueWBMFWX
@TheRealJHair Words of the great and never forgotten AI https://t.co/07RbDAuuXe
@kapaya1234 Maybe you never saw this before listen!!!!!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/07RbDAuuXe
@kapaya1234 PS you can’t speak for Vin you’re not him. Play a game in uniform I say yes. But in batting practice who cares about a f’n uniform? Evidently you do and there isn’t a rule against it. So get lost. 😡 https://t.co/JAy38jvT0Q
@bh_bryant @kapaya1234 I agree you ranting about nonsense. Practice are you kidding me? Then you said people can’t recognize the player. Who doesn’t know Utley? Please let Utley enjoy his last year in peace and not bring negativity this pisses me off seriously dude. You seem chipped over this series! https://t.co/LOHmv2aWD5
@DodgersLowDown @Joe_Davis @OrelHershiser @Nomar5 @alannarizzo @realnedcolletti @TheRealJHair @LAJohnHartung @ColeWrightNFL @shawngreen15 Great post! Truth i agree 💯
@FranklenVegas @DodgersLowDown @Joe_Davis @OrelHershiser @Nomar5 @alannarizzo @realnedcolletti @TheRealJHair @LAJohnHartung @ColeWrightNFL To all of you I’m sorry Joe, Alanna, Orel, Nomar, Ned, Jerry, John, Cole, Shawn for ranting but me as a die-hard dodger fan fight for my boys in blue 💙 dodgers for life please excuse me. Glad you are all professional!
@FranklenVegas @DodgersLowDown @Joe_Davis @OrelHershiser @Nomar5 @alannarizzo @realnedcolletti @TheRealJHair @LAJohnHartung @ColeWrightNFL @shawngreen15 How is practice being unprofessional is the question smh. The Dodgers did the same vs. Diamondbacks announcers said nothing. Kudos to that. Then the Braves announcers whining about no one can tell who they are. Who doesn’t  know Utley? They had L A caps on enough said. Smh.
@DodgersLowDown @Joe_Davis @OrelHershiser @Nomar5 @alannarizzo @realnedcolletti @TheRealJHair @LAJohnHartung @ColeWrightNFL @shawngreen15 We are talking about practice-practice-practice come on! Worry about urselves Chip Caray &amp; Joe Simpson. Then u talking about Chase Utley who deserves to do what he wants? This is his last year. Fall back off my Dodgers please somebody 😡 of this series. U seem 😩 #Dodgers 4 life https://t.co/HbbfOKFXzc
@Dodgers We got this lets sweep the Braves! https://t.co/heIHxXhsvn
@icecube Some of you haters would really flatline if they snatched social media from you! I’m just sayin’. Thugs behind a keyboard what a joke, in reality ain’t letting off no smoke.
@Dodgers The little rascals 👀 😂 how cute.
@Dodgers To add i have a illness that won’t hold me back and i will open up one day. But know this you guys really keep me going thank you for keeping me entertained i mean it from the heart. I love you guys so much. 💙

I would buy Dodger merch from a kid &amp; still do no matter the cost thank you Dodgers. 💙 you got me for life. &gt; https://t.co/NVRtVPnQRQ
Does anyone have that wind up and a pitch from @Cody_Bellinger in the bottom of the 8th when Kershaw left the game and the closer @kenleyjansen74 came in and he caught the 3rd out @Dodgers ? he is hinting us i think. He pitched in HS I think if I’m not mistaking.
@Dodgers @ClaytonKersh22 Great pitching from Kersh. https://t.co/bFl9yHU5Xo
They played “Get Smart” theme again for Max Muncy @Joe_Davis
@Dodgers Rich Hill all the way. Showing he can be a two way player too. 💙
@Joe_Davis This song https://t.co/Vwykx150uD I use to watch this on TV land channel
@Joe_Davis Did you notice they played “Get Smart” for Max when he came up look back in the top of the 8th. Don Adams use to play a spy his name was Max.
@TheRealJHair Great point.
@TheRealJHair .....................
@Dodgers Yes love your caption on IG also “First of Manny (Many)” great humor. Love you all! Dodgers for life.
@Dodgers Congrats to Machado go Dodgers!
@maxmuncy9 Can I get a follow back please Max?
@kikehndez You gave it your all, that’s all that matters.

@alannarizzo @kobebryant Here is his picture Kobe and Alanna has the interview of him mentioning you. He plays with ❤️ and determination like you. Hope you two connect soon. https://t.co/iyyAUZRNC9
Hi @kobebryant we now have in L A arguably the best SS /3B who was acquired a few days ago from the Orioles. He usually wears #13 but said he took #8 4 the dodgers becuz of u, he even named his dog “Kobe.” He said u are his fav pls watch a game or two. His name is Manny Machado https://t.co/IF64Ggqw5h
@majorandminors1 @Joe_Davis Exactly what I said.
@WendellPrice7 @Joe_Davis Exactly what i’m hoping for! A guy of the caliber is not a rental, he is long term let’s go Dodgers.
@Joe_Davis I just knew he would be and you’re a great sound bite of his greatness 💙
Love one another. Love is love!
@mtycks @suejo825 I can’t dm you not following me :(
@mtycks @suejo825 I don’t know if you remember me Matthew but you helped me a great deal a few years back :) I will tell you in DM
Once you stop chasing the wrong things, the right ones catch you.
Sometimes we have to let go of what’s killing us, even if it’s killing us to let go.
Don’t ruin a good day today by thinking about a bad yesterday. Let it go.
@mtycks @suejo825 We as Dodger Die-hard fans are glad to have her aboard she will do just great....hi Sue 💙 ...as for you Matthew, you will dearly be missed. Good luck in all you do! Once a Dodger always a Dodger #Dodgers #LADetermined
@mtycks @Dodgers You’re the best we as fans miss you dearly.
We all as Dodger fans, love you @suejo825 you will be good in the transition:) of @mtycks who we all dearly love &amp; will miss. 💙 #Dodgers for life.
1 Peter 4:8: “Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins."
Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. Ephesians 4:2: “Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love."
@NaviaZRobinson Congrats hope it goes for many many seasons very good family show. I love the show so much....my nephew got me into it! Great actors &amp; actresses u all are. Keep up the great work you got my support for life and so do the rest of the cast. Love “Free Rein” by the way. 😀
@DennisSantanaRD @x_Th3_Truth_x @Jacob_Rudner @DodgersLowDown @agentmo1 @Obrother4 Big congratulations!
See why I say keep Bellinger at 1B he can stretch and dig out balls very well. Look here &gt; Great throw from Machado #Dodgers @Dodgers Nothing against Muncy i love him a lot. https://t.co/1oF9YVm2PV
On that note: je vous aime tous
God over Everything!
The excuses we make destroy the results we deserve.
Bob Geren thanks so much for giving up #8 to Machado &amp; taking #16 #Dodgers we love #LA
@relevant_roman 😂 too funny lol.
This is what my soul is telling me, be peaceful and love everyone.
Wow what an amazing story. https://t.co/DgiKWwtc1x
Loving everyone does not mean everyone will love u. Love everyone because you want to expand your world. We are here to know the unknown, love everyone, feel the joy of life and then we parish with infinite happiness. Whatever you do, never forget to love everyone around you.❤️
Like Chase Utley dad said “No need to brag. If you’re good you don’t need to tell people they will tell you. #Humble that’s me. 🤫 https://t.co/396Vwa9zlK
@kenleyjansen74 @Dodgers @SportsNetLA @AM570LASports @LosDodgers @DodgerInsider Aw. How cute you’re the best.
@DodgerfanDave Very true
@DodgerfanDave Yup I was very mad from that lost to Astros ughhh!!!!!
@DodgerfanDave But it’s gonna be hard to many great players we have Kiké we need him in the lineup too.
@DodgerfanDave True. I would do it like this. 1B Muncy 2B Seager when he comes back. SS Machado 3B Turner LF Kemp CF Bellinger RF Puig/Taylor
@SportsNetLA I see Matt Kemp :)
@DodgerfanDave I’m a season ticket holder. But I mean as the hats and t-shirts are being sold during the playoffs and WS i gotta do a rat race. smh!
@DodgerfanDave Also the wagon riders went up to 95% now. I’m gonna now have to make sure anytime I’m busy hurry and get my new hats, etc. and World Series hats it’s now gonna be sold out because of the wagon riders now lol. smh!
@DodgerfanDave I hope not. When Seager come back my thoughts is he should go to 2B especially with that TJS. Keep Machado at SS.
@DodgerfanDave lol all the wagon riders out right now smh. I been a fan since day 1. https://t.co/921ZjtW3vi
@chinamcclain Get it that was great 😀 love seeing you happy!
Dear @Dodgers can we get a wallpaper of Manny Machado for our phones please as a Dodger. Love you guys and thank you. 💙
Be thankful for the beautiful moment. Be thankful for the gift of today. Be thankful for how far you have reached.
I thank God for my life, success, family, friends, humans, animals and all his creations in this entire world. I love you all from the ❤️
Any day above ground is a good day. Before you complain about anything, be thankful for your life and the things that are still going well.
The most attractive thing about you should have less to do with your face or body and more to do with your attitude and how you treat people.
Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.
Patiently waiting for the first woman president. The day that happens i’m celebrating big! Anything a man do a woman can too! Stop discriminating against women please. We are all created equal no matter of gender, religion, race, nationality, sexual preference, etc. we are all 1!
Love each other dearly always. There is scarcely anything else in the world but that: to love one another.
Well deserved! #Dodgers 4 life! 💙 https://t.co/HqVPZTX7Ps
@Tuff_Overlord Aw. How cool!
@Tuff_Overlord See you’re lucky.
@Tuff_Overlord Nice pic with you and JT by the way. 💙
@Tuff_Overlord I know right?
@DOYERFANATICA Yup! 💙
@Tuff_Overlord I’m so excited. Glad I’m a season ticket holder! 💙
@RavineFiends Great pic!
@Dodgers @GoldCapPapi Wow I’m in love with this drawing. Great stuff!
Here ya go! https://t.co/5pXk1Wg0hk
I see Manny Machado will be repping the ole number 8 which you wore while you were with the Dodgers @ShaneVictorino salute to you brother! Thanks for all you did for us Dodger fans. 💙
To all Dodgers fan this just in Manny Machado will play vs. the Brewers at SS tomorrow yes!!!!! #Dodgers lets go!
I grew up seeing Joey as their 3B coach. :)
Manny Machado will wear #8 I will go far back Joey Amalfitano use to b the @Dodgers 3rd base coach &amp; wore #8 from 1983-1998. The last dodger player 2 wear #8 was Shane Victorino 2012. #Dodgers true fan forever and when i die i want dodgers &amp; L A logo on my tombstone true diehard
They say a picture is worth a thousand words right? Well here’s my proof i’ve always been a #Dodgers⁠ ⁠fan. Die hard fan. 💙💙💙💙💙 https://t.co/S72dvE0MDl
@realnedcolletti @Dodgers I am so Happy :)
@coachcamxxx @DodgerInsider I keep saying Bellinger is better at 1B longer stretch, etc. but we need Muncy in there too. Well we will see how it plays out.
@alexcitosss @michaelsnarky @valor_nash @DodgerInsider @Dodgers I like your idea too plus it will be easier on his arm after having TJS.
@michaelsnarky @alexcitosss @valor_nash @DodgerInsider @Dodgers I hope we can keep him the rest of his career.
@michaelsnarky @alexcitosss @valor_nash @DodgerInsider @Dodgers Catcher Grandal/Barnes
@michaelsnarky @alexcitosss @valor_nash @DodgerInsider @Dodgers I love it. I was thinking the same.
@DodgerInsider @Dodgers Maybe CT3 at 2B right? Then when Seager comes back maybe Seager at 2B. Machado stay at SS. But then we gotta find a spot for Muncy this is gonna be hard. I hope he retires with us love my #Dodgers
@court_with_a_K @Dodgers @redturn2 @Awood45 This will definitely go down in history. Love the welcoming of Turner &amp; Wood. Can’t wait to see them all in action. :)
@Azsonicsnake I totally agree!
Always respect a woman to the fullest whether it be physically or verbally. Women can do anything men can do. Glad to see a lot of women as superheroes, etc. &amp; getting more acknowledged on tv &amp; in movies and in the world❤️ #Equality I don’t discriminate nothing or anyone I ❤️
Love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels, simply by pouring out love. Love is infectious and the greatest healing energy.
The only difference between you and the person you admire is their perspective on life.
Love each other dearly always. There is scarcely anything else in the world but that: to love one another.
I am so happy @Azsonicsnake how about you? #Mannywood2018 now a Dodger. 💙
@Dodgers Obviously they did they knew Machado had to be clear of health records first. Love you Dodgers!

@Dodgers Kersh
@SportsNetLA This the part where I wish baseball would add a 4th outfielder. We gotta keep Toles. But all the other are good as well Pederson, Kemp and Puig. Please @mlb give us an exception. What you think @OrelHershiser @Joe_Davis ?
@DodgersNation I love Toles he got wheels. https://t.co/AjpO0GQEzu

@JeffFletcherOCR It’s strange I use to play and watch the Dodgers and we were always taught that and Vin Scully use to say it in the late 80s
@JeffFletcherOCR It was in the 80s am I missing something
@ChaseGrisham @DodgersNation Where did it go?
@DodgersNation Tie goes to the runner. 🤦🏽‍♂️

@Jonathan_Feigen Wrong D-Wade has.
@stephenasmith @KingJames All these Lakers fans all of a sudden better realize he still has to face the Warriors to get to the finals. I’m not a Laker fan. I love Lebron from day one but I’m not a B.W.R. *drops the mic*
@candicekp You deserve it.
@candicekp @MaxineWaters She’s right.
@candicekp Best said. See that’s why I luv ya so much. You’re a very strong woman ❤️
@candicekp 💐🌹
@wojespn @candicekp Doesn’t surprise me.
@candicekp That’s why I always respect you and call you Candice. Love ya! ❤️
@TianneKing @YouTube Hi how are you?
@Nancyluvxo @TheRealJHair Aw, great of the Yankees rip to Junior. Violence has to stop and ASAP we all need to learn we are all one. Stay blessed!
@ArashMarkazi @TheRealJHair I’m not a Laker fan but you can’t forget Wilt Chamberlin.
@chinamcclain I did already sis 10 times! Love the show and you all. God bless! https://t.co/mlzeqxvGoY
@JerryRice Aw I got unfollowed again by the good one. :( God bless Jerry forever your fan
@TheRealJHair @yungjoc650 I’m loving the “wrist wiggling celebration” I will name it, started by CT3 the Dodgers been all doing. #Dodgers⁠ ⁠ good name I gave it? Or you guys came up with something better? https://t.co/726ZTEXvL8
@kikehndez @Dodgers New name for you Kiké.....”Kiké the Magician” you’re magical &amp; good on both sides of the field :) offense &amp; defense in my opinion you killing it at SS great job :)
@chinamcclain @CressWilliams @ChristineAdams @NafessaWilliams @thesalimakil Aw this is so cute.
@kikehndez @MarianaPVicente Kiké is starting to remind me a lot of Ozzie Smith in the past. He has a high iq and deserves to stay at the 6 position. He’s earned it. When Corey comes back will be a decision then but for now Kiké for SS. https://t.co/vK6qqZFGTN
@chinamcclain @CressWilliams I definitely am. https://t.co/uLg8yB5sac
@KalisWorld @netflix Check out “The Chi” on Showtime replay and “On my Block” on Netflix great shows.
@KalisWorld Ignore the hate, because you’re great!
@kikehndez I put you in as a write on at SS. Hope you win no pun intended to CT3 I love you all. But your my fav Dodger. https://t.co/hA6aD9TFQc
@Kanyow15 @chinamcclain Tell me about it I would pay to have it come back quicker even if it cost hundreds this show is very good.
@kikehndez @Kike20Hndz Same to you Kiké, Dodgers!
@Joe_Davis You’re the man, glad we got a great broadcaster such as you. You keep the game exciting wishing you nothing but the best for years to come. Please have a safe flight back to LA also. #Dodgers
@Joe_Davis Happy Father’s day Joe! We all love you. Let’s go #Dodgers :)
@marcus11599 @TheRealJHair @tonygwynnjr @BleacherReport No lie I don’t really follow the NBA. But I will admit if LJ23 go anywhere it would prolly be the Warriors.
@organistalert @DieterRuehle @Joe_Davis One last one for sure maybe this I don’t know. https://t.co/MLwDnkjSGg
@organistalert @DieterRuehle @Joe_Davis You’re a genius Dieter. https://t.co/UyuqMUCzUE
@organistalert @DieterRuehle @Joe_Davis Can’t wait for the day Dieter plays “Purple Haze-Jimi Hendrix and “Tonite is the nite-Betty Wright” maybe also https://t.co/ZNRati10To &amp; this last one in the next tweet.
@NiaNRiley It’s more a snack, not food!
@LaurenLondon @ummPretty Hi Lauren
@TheRealJHair @tonygwynnjr @BleacherReport The NBA league won’t let that happen. Look at a few years ago when “CP3” trade was blocked.
@kikehndez @MarianaPVicente Dude two to do on your list 1. Dancing with the Stars 2. Stand up Comedy. God bless and love you and the Dodgers :)
@Dodgers @kikehndez Good analogy and the truth we all need support. Way to go Dodgers. :)
@Dodgers Happy Birthday!
@Dodgers @YasielPuig @WildHorseFDN Aw how nice well deserved. We love you all!❤️We miss you Vin so much.
@VinScullysSon @DieterRuehle I think you hit it right thanks so much.
@booboostewart @Gresh49 I will jog your memory. The EOTM Awards a few years back.
@booboostewart @Gresh49 How you been bro? Hope all is well.
@chinamcclain Amen! All praises due to God. Proud of you!
@chinamcclain Congrats sis! 🎈😎

@NiaNRiley God 1st then you. In that order in that order.
@candicekp The nerve of some people. Smh. I hope she comes back and ignores the ignorance of such people. You inspire so many. :)
@candicekp Thank you. You said it best. Love what you stand for and the greatness in you. Great point and I concur.
My Cousin and my late Grandma, rip. https://t.co/h8YxeurrkW
@Gem2Gorgeous God bless! 😇🌷🌹
@NafessaWilliams @WilliamsNafessa So dreams don’t come true. Woke up and saw this thinking it was @NafessaWilliams following me i must admit i was very happy at the time but come to find out it’s a catfish account pretending to be her i give up smh. https://t.co/57Go2ZTB2n
@kikehndez Love ya Kiké got your jersey and all. You’re my favorite Dodger. I love all the rest too. But you know we all have a favorite something in life.
@SportsNetLA See I say keep Cody at 1B maybe Muncy some where else in the INF. But love Roberts he knows best. 1B is not too much of a run in the OF for Bellinger so he is more energized. #Dodgers https://t.co/IgDpgwNvgY
@SportsNetLA I was very close &amp; with the homers. ;) https://t.co/ygJUoa0gzC
@SportsNetLA @yungjoc650 Y’all got the dodgers hitting all these Homers do the same tomorrow ask us who will hit ‘em I’m loving it.
@SportsNetLA @yungjoc650 Update Warriors won the NBA finals
Congrats @warriors
Told y’all @warriors would win.
@SportsNetLA Braves 4 Dodgers 7 will be final
@pyrosaxplayer I agree 😎
@pyrosaxplayer Taylor is not in the lineup but he will come in later watch.
@Dodgers Equality is a plus ❤️
@pyrosaxplayer Thanks Jacob.
@NiaNRiley You’re so pretty.
@NafessaWilliams Enjoy have fun. 😎
@SportsNetLA Cody, Kemp and Taylor will go yard.
@chinamcclain @mikejmcclain Looking at ‘Lightning’ can’t wait. https://t.co/cGFJPoeqeD
@TheRealJHair 💯
@KyleRowland Two years later and y’all still on that? Time is money, money is time!
@ItsMikeHill @TheRealJHair The Cavs will lose unless Steph Curry says I’m going on an early vacation this year, nots 😂 go #Warriors
@pyrosaxplayer Exactly. He gets to rest more than running around in the OF. I seen the fatigue from him the other day.
@SportsNetLA @Cody_Bellinger Nothing against Max Muncy I love him a lot but Cody Bellinger needs to stay at 1B when he is playing the OF it’s more work for a player notice he hit a hr today. Just my two cents I’m not the manager i totally respect Roberts but that’s my opinion. #Dodgers⁠ ⁠
@chinamcclain @Kenya18M Sorry to see this China. Change your password and try, 2 step authentication. Last but least never click on a link you’re not sure about. Much love sis.

With your services we as humans get to sleep and carry on with our lives. I truly thank you all. Have a safe Memorial Day! https://t.co/UAriZID5J0
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers You’re very welcome.
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers Thanks so much. Yea Dodgers STH is worth it. Good luck on the Raiders STH to you and the family :)
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers Haha I’ve been attending for years every time I show up we win, except once. Just became a Season Ticket Holder this year, so i will be at a lot more. Took over for my dad who passed away. I’ve always been a dodger fan :) https://t.co/i1h5OfzBZC

@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers Remember this bro Dodgers for life &amp; beyond.
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers But don’t bash Roberts please we as Dodgers fans gotta support every last Dodger on the roster.
@_jmiranda31 @Dodgers Exactly they need to stop the bashing.
@pyrosaxplayer @Dodgers I go way back as a fan, games use to be on KTTV, KTLA, KCOP and then K-Cal. Doesn’t matter I’m a STH holder and a SportsNetLA (Spectrum) subscriber. #Dodgers I love ‘em forever.
@_jmiranda31 @Dodgers Exactly people act like the team suppose to win all the games they play. You win some you lose some. No one can go 162-0. I’m a #Dodgers fan for life. We can’t win every single game on a schedule it irritates me as a fan to see people keep bashing the team i luv so much.
@LovelyLeo75 @She_hasNoWorrys Congrats my friend to Cam.
@iRJq @Dodgers Exactly.
@rdlarue @Dodgers Exactly see that?
@OrelHershiser Love ya Orel you’re the best can’t never forget you. Thank you so much and you’re doing great in the booth. Love your knowledge of the game along with Joe.
@JaySton87054413 @eddy_295 @RaymondSarmie23 @Dodgers That part @JaySton87054413 I agree. https://t.co/lpRlHKyLWy

@ChandlerAlexiss Hi i been leaving messages in your dm on IG i guess you forgot about me. Fellow mixed Belizean. All love.
Tweet before this...I’ve been dealing with for a while. I love you all. If you notice I’m not making sense in my tweets please forgive me. Concussions is no joke. Please send me prayers.
This grade 2 concussion I’m suffering from is no joke. My brain isn't functioning normal. My vision is disturbed, i lose equilibrium, I fall at times. In short, my brain is very confused. Bad headaches i can keep going, but i will keep fighting. 5th time in my career. Next is ... https://t.co/c2ApDZBsXq
#IDontTrustPeopleThat talks behind others back, because they could be doing the same to you.
@TheSierraCapri Can i get a follow please Monse. Would mean a lot and patiently waiting  on OMB season 2 you kept season 1 going hilarious and suspenseful.
@Cheesepuff2009 @SportsNetLA @alannarizzo @buehlersdayoff Thanks so much.....Ok but instead of the bashing try keeping a positive mind and express the positivity to our team the Dodgers. The players and staff need us and we need them send them some positive we believe in you tweets. #Dodgers we just resting right now we will be there ;)
@HobbesCarlota @SportsNetLA @alannarizzo @buehlersdayoff Thanks so much it’s the truth.
@Cheesepuff2009 @SportsNetLA @alannarizzo @buehlersdayoff What I’m trying to say once they start winning all the riders will hop back on the wagon. If your a true fan you stick to your team like me. #Dodgers I’m even a season ticket holder and glad to be one. That will never change. A pic is worth 1000 words here’s me as a lil boy :) https://t.co/OBkKGkzcWu
@Injustice2Go Killer Frost she ain’t no joke
@SportsNetLA @alannarizzo @buehlersdayoff All of you that’s bashing my Dodgers I’m watching you. Same one’s that will be bandwagon riding once again. I stay true blue forever #Dodgers cheer on your team not bashing ‘em https://t.co/sEA3xwgEDy

The Dodgers gave it all they could great game #Dodgersforlife a 5hr and 46 min game. https://t.co/E7ROBgaxKy
If we were at home that would’ve been a walk off oh well. Still #DodgerBlue for life.
@SportsNetLA  https://t.co/PoXgokY2Dh
@OsheaJacksonJr I thought we had it ughhh

Born a @Dodgers fan, a Dodger fan for life. Not talking negatively but when it’s my time to be buried told my family to put Dodgers on my tombstone. So that lets you know I’m a diehard fan #MLBMemoryBank #DodgersForever I just love the boys in blue. https://t.co/OrectuqX4O

@orblueduck @mrvincecarter15 Looks can be deceiving.
@orblueduck @mrvincecarter15 He didn’t intentionally do that. Steve Kerr and the whole GS said it wasn’t done on purpose. Hey but your opinion is your opinion you’re entitled to one. But 95% of us said it wasn’t intentional.
@LovelyLeo75 Thanks so much.

@hemauzumaki @candicekp @CW_TheFlash Also watch the b word you use on a woman. Do you call your mom that? Stop verbally and physically abusing women. I don’t care what no one says. Women are the glue to this earth. I love men too. But truth is truth.
@hemauzumaki @candicekp @CW_TheFlash Dude get on with you’re disrespect to a woman. Women rule this world whether you like it or not &amp; she is not ugly. So ur hate need to go elsewhere. Why do many of you men continue to disrespect women? No women no us. My mom raised me while my dad kept me out his life.
r.i.p you will always be remembered. https://t.co/eHm3eg8yCO

@Wittman7 Good luck with that! We are winning this year and he will be our biggest motivation and the one to help us. Smh.
@Wittman7 Exactly. I have a saying I’ve made years ago “What goes in people head?!” ~Flash Rose~

@49ers Good stuff Seahawks! I use to be a niner fan since to 80s bought all the gear, hats, etc.but won’t get in to why I’m no longer one and it’s not because of the losing. Just say two staff members were very rude to me, enough said I’m done, God bless them.

@maverik999 @VeniceMase Say that when he wins the Cy Young stop bashing the man he’s the hardest work out pitcher in the game even in the off season
That will change mark my words. My boys in blue will win we been coming back in games all season and will comeback this series 😉 https://t.co/7tT4r0wmkw
@VeniceMase Pls stop da negativity he is not a superhero he is human but he is the best...1 game,2 games doesn’t make him not gr8 view his overall stats

He is the best and no one can take that from him @ClaytonKersh22 is the hardest working pitcher and gives back he is human and I love him. https://t.co/d47oHsF7gC
@pepinoguy Dodger Stadium is way bigger and more depth and there’s no DH rule in the NL so there pitchers will have to bat
@pepinoguy Not juiced the Park is too dang small at Dodger Stadium all the Astros balls they hit will be outs 😉
@hillbillyjim88 @DodgersWayFS When and if you guys win the series then report back to me till then there’s no discussion. You guys are not at that small park anymore 😉
Like Puig Said @TheRealJHair there will be a game 7 and I agree with a lot you say. Much love bro! PS no DH in the NL 😎 one game at a time.
Mark this there will be a game 7 I believe in my team of course after God! #ThisTeam I’ve been bleeding blue since birth we’re home 💪🏽
Dodger Stadium don’t have a dome welcome to our house 😉
The dome will not be closed no long balls will come that easy for the opponents our field is way biggr. Get ready we will send it to 7 &amp; win
@SportsNetLA It’s ok we still got a chance. Take it one game at a time.
It’s ok @Dodgers fans including myself we are going home we still got this #ThisTeam
@iamcamillap Dodgers vs. Astros
Dude shouldn’t even be in this game after that racist slur &amp; gesture smh.
All iOS users download this amazing app. @convozapp https://t.co/DjUFE4ffuj https://t.co/DjUFE4ffuj I’m on there search “Flash” great app!
As the great Vin Scully would say #ITFDB
@iamcamillap you’re watching the game tonight?
@iamcamillap Aww how cute!
@iamcamillap I bet you don’t have on
@Dodgers Yes
@realnedcolletti @Dodgers You have a great point.

@MLBStatoftheDay @Cody_Bellinger This kid is talented and we haven’t seen nothing yet! Watch there is a lot to come from this young man!
If everyone has a problem with you, you may be the problem.
Hoping I can climb back in my stock car and race again. Stay tuned!
So 2 more wins and I will cut my hair #LetsGoDodgers #WorldSeries had long hair since after the 88 World Series
One last word u r the Michael Jordan of Baseball @Cody_Bellinger glad u looking at other teammates in practice it’s gr8 to learn from others
But anyway your a spectacular player and glad you play for my Dodgers 😎 You will be just fine and a gr8 1st baseman. Get ‘em @Cody_Bellinger
I believed in you @Cody_Bellinger &amp; knew u would break through. Place da ball all over like ur doing these coaches won’t know how 2 play u.
Gr8 stuff @Cody_Bellinger proud of u.Ur very talented, good thing u startd 2 hit 4 da opposite field. In HS I did da same was hard 2 play me
Wouldn’t it be so sweet to see the @Dodgers win it all at home for #Halloween2017 and passing out L A candy at game 6 #LetsGoDodgers 🙏🏽🙏🏽
@Dodgers @Awood45 @Cody_Bellinger Now that’s team togetherness #ThisTeam #WorldSeries #AllForOneOneForAll
@DodgersNation The team came together. *That’s the answer* ❤️
Too much hate in this world focus on you and not worry about another greatness. More importantly love one another and give respect.
Don’t get me wrong Wikipedia is cool but there are too much tampering from the public smh.
My manager spoke to Wikipedia years ago and said no articles ever on me. So there you have it. Wikipedia does not solidify your career ;)
People ask why I’m not on Wikipedia because of crap like this. Anyone can make edits sadly. I’m a Dodger fan but this is uncalled for. https://t.co/w5eQRhvapK
@Dodgers Alex Wood pitched great, Bellinger got key hits. Forsythe tied the game. Hard one but Pederson homer can change this series.
@Dodgers We needed a homer at their stadium
@Dodgers Pederson keeps our momentum going and will fire up the other players for tomorrow #ThisTeam
God job @kenleyjansen74 and much respect.
@ItsBingyBaby I got one 😎
@MandeePrincess1 hi
@Dodgers It always does 😉
Great pitching @Awood45 💪🏼

@LAKings I never really been to a hockey game before but will come soon. I know I will like it and I will be a season ticket holder 😎

For real @el_yuly10 you totally owe @faridyu an apology that was very disrespectful &amp; not right on ur part. We got enough drama in this wrld
@michaeljduarte @RevDodgerBlue He needs to b kicked out the league. I don’t condone 2 racist idiots. ‘I love all races of all faces in all places.’ ~Flash~ that’s my quote
@Dodgers It’s ok everyone stay loyal and cheer hard our Dodgers are coming back to ‘Dodger Stadium’ make some noise on that day! We got this!
I will always be a Dodger season ticket holder @Dodgers love you guys and my loyalty will always be to you guys. We will comeback! #ThisTeam

@Dodgers @YasielPuig Better not he will throw you out.
I really miss Vin Scully as our announcer &amp; a human gr8 man😭😭 class act for @Buck to say he would drive and pick him up to be in the booth 😎

Here’s the difference night mode is easier on my eyes here’s the difference on the two. https://t.co/PinGUKcFZR
So I understand now my screen shots look dark because because I turned night mode on twitter it’s easier on my eyes.
Sad story I lost my mom 2 cancer it was a nightmare I felt like I lost it all. Prayers up 2 Tom Brady https://t.co/8thLtLmTOX
By the way #TBT = Throw back time 😉
I called it from July 31 #WorldSeries plus I got an announcement! https://t.co/v0cTGFNYij
@PuertoRicoPUR @TheRealJHair Sad 😞
I use to enjoy 1B Garvey 2B Lopes SS Russell 3B Cey the best infield ever. This 2017 is reminding me a lot like them 😎
Who could ever forget Fernandomania? They even use to play a song called “Fernando” there was a book called “Fernando the Bull”
will this take long I really need to get to Dodger Stadium to see the game. Talk about die hard I’m the same way. Now he is rip.
#TBT I remember I had parent/teacher conference night. Dodgers was in the World Series and Fernando was pitching. My dad asked the teacher&gt;
@SportsNetLA I predicted the World Series match up from July 31 I circled the date I tweeted it in red. I was replying to a tweet from fox ;) https://t.co/ANkenJivec
@anneliesevdp @ravensymone @DisneyChannel Great show watches it with my little cousin. She loves the show and so do i great family show.

@sarah_grey8 hi
The World Series is the NL vs. the AL
If Astros were still in the National League we don’t play against them. They moved to the American League in 2013. This is gonna be strange.
I called this WS matchup from July 31 here is my proof @FoxSportsRadio @Dodgers @Howard_Cole @TheRealJHair. Fox Sports told u. #GoDodgersGo https://t.co/ZlHBaZtAiZ
@THEREAL_DV Dear Vin Scully, pls for a loyal Dodger fan and others please give us 1 last announcin pls I beg u. You’re the best ❤️u it would be a memory

@Dodgers Notice Cody Bellinger caught the catcher foot was in the way. Cute gif I love it. 😎

You cannot block the path before you have the ball in your glove. https://t.co/zlCErGgMDS
https://t.co/zlCErGgMDS
@ChrisRose https://t.co/zlCErGgMDS
@ChrisRose The plate deal. Rule 7.13 Article 2 a catcher cannot block a runner from scoring unless he has the ball.
Magic # 7
@DodgersNation He was safe per Rule 7.13 Article 2 a catcher cannot block a runner from scoring unless he has the ball in his glove.
@MagicJohnson @Dodgers I agree 29 years we are due for the World Series and to win it!

Bellinger's spectacular catch Sent with @MLB At Bat he is amazing with a high IQ go @Cody_Bellinger i believed day 1 https://t.co/8AKjLzNPa6
That catch Cody made in the dugout was amazing.

@Dodgers #Dodgers4Ever love you guys. Thanks for the nice gif ❤️
@Dodgers Aww how cute I love it! 😎
I gave @Cody_Bellinger the name “Cody Pop” he is poppin on the field &amp; @ bat. He is acrobatic, look at da out he did in the air vs. Giants.
Glad Roberts helped to break his fall.
I kept telling everyone @Cody_Bellinger was gonna be a great addition to the Dodgers. His IQ is out of this world! I told you guys he is 1B
I knew it was coming @Cody_Bellinger #CodyPop got the hr yes @TheRealJHair
Yes he did and loving it! https://t.co/zMJUbYAuee
@TheRealJHair I agree let’s go Dodgers!
Darvish not playing glad his mechanics is changed!

@Howard_Cole I agree
Yu breaks the record of K’s
Love the fact @ClaytonKersh22 and the pitching staff saw something @faridyu was missing. Glad he listened 😎 we love YU
It’s cool 3 LOB.
Bases are loaded!
I love the fact Greinke pitch count is very high. He will get pulled by the 4th inning 100 is the max. #GoDodgers

I can see @Grani_13 as a starting pitcher for the Dodgers I like him. Glad we acquired him. 😎
I was invited to single a which I turned down b’n young &amp; confused, but yea I would’ve chrgd dat mound to let it b known u can’t bully me.
I’m tired of you idiots hitting my dodgers @Rockies I’ve could signed years ago if it were me I would’ve fought the pitcher and the coaches
@ashwamxo hi
I’ve been a dodger fan since young and i will never give up on them. https://t.co/LLHZar5ejf
@Dodgers :(
@Dodgers @TheRealJHair @SportsNetLA @Howard_Cole I like “Cody Pop” better than “Belli-Bomber” for @Cody_Bellinger it’s more catching.
@stumitchellQB7 @ClaytonKersh22 @kenleyjansen74 It’s easy who has the least era? Also winning pct.? Easy @ClaytonKersh22 and yes don’t forget about @kenleyjansen74 #DodgerFanSince2

@realnedcolletti much love looking forwarding to meeting you and buying your book. Stay blessed! Congrats!
@DodgerFanWeekly 1. Pitching with Kershaw, Darvish, Hill 1-2-3 punch and our hitting has came around. 2. I think he made the right move look at us best team
Follow up to the last tweet my hair been long since I was 18.
This is a promise if my @Dodgers win the pennant which I know they will!I’m cutting my hair.That means I gotta get new Dodgers fitted hats.
Rip Hugh Hefner
One wrong move and you can end up in the wall. But anyway more throw back. https://t.co/6HJFCLForQ
2017 I’m out due to an injury but I should be ok to return in 2018. Meantime here’s a throwback. https://t.co/zs8gXEF74L

@alannarizzo @AlexGam2013 We love you! Yes we did! I’m so happy!
@molly_knight I agree 😎
@Dodgers I got one for Doc. Will Bellinger remain a first baseman? Or will he be moved to the outfield. Love you guys stay blessed!
@KalidTheKing @DrDumbDum @svicidechrist @RetroBoomin707 @Dodgers This is the year!
So with that being said twitter is going from 140 to 280 characters yes, thank you twitter!

@MLB @Dodgers That’s right! 😎
@g_pineda hi bro it was great meeting you. You’re the man. Glad the Dodgers won big tonite 😎
@kikehndez my condolences goes out to your grand dad rip &amp; to all of ur family. I know how it is to lose a grand dad. I just found out! GB!
@DominaeMusic ;)
@Howard_Cole Thank you for the scoop also now I can breathe whewww! How you been by the way?
@Howard_Cole That’s true just worried about him in the OF throwing 2 home or crashing the outfield wall. But you got a point. PS OF is a lot of field.
Yup @Cody_Bellinger was once a pitcher with Hamilton and is my favorite Dodger. The day he follows me I will be honored. Here it is @Dodgers https://t.co/YxvCFgvqNm
@Howard_Cole I still prefer Bellinger at 1B. In the outfield he could get injured we need his talent especially on offense.
Here it is @Cody_Bellinger https://t.co/c3unkCtZMa
@Cody_Bellinger was once a pitcher did you all know that?
@Dodgers I attended this whole home stand &amp; will attend tomorrow as well as da playoffs you guys have my heart 4 ever of course after the good Lord.
@Dodgers love u all so much the team, staff, parking attendants, etc Im proud to call my self a fan of so so many years.  I feel at home.
@coachpowell48  nice meeting you, you’re a down to earth person and always help the Dodgers I’ve followed for many years. https://t.co/f8VZ5G3ek4

@Dodgers Dennis Powell #48 the greatest @Dodgers https://t.co/MRWopn3RV0
Anyway after 29 years my boys in blue will win the pennant in 6 games I’m predicting
This in I will not return to racing till 2018 due to a health issue. Love u all. God bless!
But I will say I consider myself a fan at 2 because they told me that’s when I would cheer and all.To my Dodgers win or lose u got me 4 life
So I grew up a dodger fan. As for my dad and mom they are both R.I.P.  miss them so much.
My dad worked for a govt. agency which I choose not to disclose and took my mom and my siblings. With that and my attendance it’s 504.
From a newborn my dad took me to all the Dodger home games because he got tix from his job. We had field seats all games I’ve been to 504
We won yes!
@Dodgers That’s the path to our pennant this year. 😉 I will be there. The 29 year drought will be over #Dodgers2017Champs
See when I come we win my attendance record is 502-2 😎 @Dodgers https://t.co/dzTzWwptSA
Dear Dave Roberts pls keep @Cody_Bellinger at 1st base we need him injury free pls. Love y’all. PS last time he was in the OF I called it.
@Dodgers @BankofAmerica Will we see @Cody_Bellinger at first base regularly? Reason I ask less injuries and he’s 1 of our top hitters. 2 many injuries occur in OF.
@Dodgers enjoying the game https://t.co/NOtThv4Hsc
Come on Roberts @buehlersdayoff earned his spot for the playoffs for sure.
See why I like @buehlersdayoff and really feel he can become an SP and on the playoff roster. Bases was loaded and he got out the jam.
No lie I know see the confidence in Baez eyes come on big fellow you can do this! #BaezGotThis
@buehlersdayoff in my opinion Buehler deserves to stay on the playoff roster. The kid is great and I like him. 😎
Hi @dariustrugman I appreciate the work you guys do to keep us safe. I love you all and thank you 4 serving and protecting us all. I fllwd u
@kikehndez Leave Kike alone he having fun. It’s a great moment! Proud of him. LetsGoDodgers.
Please keep @Cody_Bellinger at first base he is great there and will sustain less injuries. Please Doc trust me!
I love all my Dodgers but @Cody_Bellinger is my favorite he came aboard two days before my birthday which is 4/27 same day as @coreyseager_5
@Dodgers @DodgersLowDown @TommyLasorda On your Birthday Tommy yes!

@Dodgers I love you guys! https://t.co/11y2Bwuags
@IAmDanniV hi
@kikehndez I got y’all bro! God bless!
Don’t get me wrong i love all the Dodgers but you can’t start everyone.
RP would be Cingrani, Jansen, Watson, couple of other. Hernandez DH for the World Series ;)
Hill, Wood. Baez cut him off the roster.
But I’m not Dave Roberts I respect his choices. Those are just my opinion and what I would do. I would even start Buehler, Kershaw, Darvish,
My predictive lineup dat would win it all 4 dodgers 1B Bellinger 2B Utley SS Seager 3B Turner LF Taylor CF Either RF Puig C Barnes #Dodgers
@RavineFiends Yes
@FOXSports1340 Sometimes I wonder if this is facts or were he killed hmmmm! He was wrong for the murder of course.
@GigiGraciette Some people we need to all stay positive.Too much negativity in this world. God bless Gigi prayers to the loss ones their families &amp; friends
Prayers to 🇲🇽 and to 🇵🇷 let’s all pray strong people. Love one another.
@kikehndez my prayers to you and your family in 🇵🇷 God Bless. Love you all and my Dodgers.

We as #DodgersFan love you @alannarizzo you’re a great broadcaster! Me from 2. Once a fan always a Dodger fan 😎 https://t.co/rZtjZ0xjQ4
@Howard_Cole You’re welcome by the way. So mad about this game I forgot to mention you’re welcome.
Sad. I still love him as a human. But he needs to step it up or go to OKC. https://t.co/jarxdimJ3H
@McCulloughTimes Why 😩🙄
Keep doing you bro! God bless! https://t.co/PzCWnbvriE
Dear Dave Roberts, As you can see Baez is trending # 1 ughhhh
@Howard_Cole Not funny but we need these wins this is not spring training.
@Howard_Cole Should’ve been traded him and got Zach Britton from the Orioles instead this guy era is 2.89 15 saves 29 K’s.
@Howard_Cole I hope so he always blowing games. I love him as every human I love but this guy doesn’t have it. We trying to get the W’s not L’s.
I agree #StillDodgerFan4Life https://t.co/nNW12Uv1pr
😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/WtKFP43uUI
@ChicagoGod Too much going on bro!
You live by the sword you die by the sword! smh ughhhhhh!!!!!
@Howard_Cole Exactly here we go I may change my channel. Why keep him in? I’m lost!
@Howard_Cole Why why why? Why is he even in all these games I don’t get it! Put him in after we clinch Home Field smh. He has no confidence u can see it
@Howard_Cole Lol
That’s it changing my channel this dude in the game don’t have it. We keep using him why why why?! 🙄🙄🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
@Howard_Cole What I tell you? Smh
Get Baez out please!
Hope # 38 for the Phillies is fine.
@Howard_Cole told you here we go he needs to be traded or sent to OKC he keeps giving up hits &amp; hr’s 🙄 love him tho no pun intended
@Howard_Cole oh oh we in trouble now. 🙄
@Howard_Cole He is very talented right at 1B forget the OF
@Howard_Cole Wow lucky you. He showed me all I had to see when Turner threw to first and the throw was high tagged the man out while in the air at 1B
@blaise_real True. Thanks bud
@Howard_Cole He got more stretch.
@Howard_Cole Of course he can never be forgotten. But sometimes it comes a time we need to hang it up and pass the torch. I like Bellinger at 1B at 6’ 4”
I need all prayers for me please 😷 ughh hate the cold. Soups for me and plenty of fluids.
@Howard_Cole Great article. Bellinger needs to stay at 1B he is our future and present. Youth begins now. Don’t get me wrong love Gonzalez. Youth now!
@Howard_Cole Ok 6-4-3 we got ‘em 😎
@Howard_Cole It does and now the bases are loaded 🙆🏻‍♂️
@Howard_Cole I hope not!
@Howard_Cole That was a great move to get Darvish off the mound and resorting to the bullpen by Roberts. He was showing fatigue at near 100 pitches.
Good move #DaveRoberts 👌🏽go dodgers go! Relief time.
I’m saddened by dat grand slam off of @ClaytonKersh22 it was the first off him in the majors. It’s cool tho I still ❤️ my Dodgers &amp; Kershaw.
Same to you thank you, God bless! https://t.co/PaydQtveJO
@LADodgersHQ Me too this is crazy we love Grandal and Granderson but they need more time in either Triple A or the batting cage.
@KylaPratt Happy Birthday!
@redturn2 @Dodgers Justin for MVP
@IBWAA Ok thanks. 😎
God bless all! May you wake up to a new day I love you all!
@buehlersdayoff great pitching in the 9th. You are good and will get even better. #GoDodgersGo
Nice throw to 1st after the catch @kikehndez
Love one another.
Love is in the air!
Many can forgive but won’t never forget. Just some food for thought.
Watch the wrong you say in a negative way. Once you say it you said it. It’s the past and you can never take it back!
A boy seeks attention a man wants respect. PS respect a woman verbally &amp; physically, vice versa as well. Love should be mutual.
We should help one another in need not during a tragedy only. Many countries need us many organizations need us #PayitForward
@Cody_Bellinger You did that CB
@IamGabiVictor That’s right
@IBWAA Where do we vote please?
Rod Carew https://t.co/nKHwnumnaN
@faridyu Yu did it thank you and all the Dodgers :)
@TheRealJHair @Dodgers @Cody_Bellinger came up with a gr8 nickname but don’t know if u guys will like it 4 Cody. Bell Ringer or Bell Dinger?
Get ‘em @Cody_Bellinger great hr 😎
@CowDodger @BMcCarthy32 Yup
@Siennagold 😎
@blaise_real Exactly I’ve dealt with it plenty of times not easy to deal with.
It’s not funny google MRSA https://t.co/WnDQaAfCNR

@kenleyjansen74 @Dodgers @Jumpman23 @MLB_PLAYERS @LosDodgers I’m so happy now I can sleep pretty tonite.
@kenleyjansen74 Thanks for saving the game #DodgersNumber1FanForLife
@TheRealJHair Glad for the win 😎 #DodgersFanForLife.
@Dodgers Kershaw for firing the boys up! Love ‘em all however:)
We win go @Dodgers lets start a new streak.
Great to see @ClaytonKersh22 firing up the team. Get ‘em Kersh love ya and the Dodgers for life. 😎
I love Gonzalez too but @Cody_Bellinger has a longer stretch. Love all my Dodgers. Glad we got Bell 2 days before my birthday 4/25
@Cody_Bellinger needs to be franchise tagged for his entire career and stay on 1st base permanently. #ICallLikeItIs great play in the 4th CB
See why I say @Cody_Bellinger needs 2 stay at 1st base. Saw that play he made in the btm of da 4th? true talent and I love him. #DaveRoberts
@blaise_real Yup I went back in time to when we’re winning this the lineup
I love all my dodgers but this what we were winning with.
Ok so this da lineup that should b used minus Grandal at C.  Barnes at C is a better fit. #DaveRoberts you’re the skipper but just my 2cents https://t.co/7g5hIUCi8D
@Themelis_Cuiper 😎
Dear, Dave Roberts please send Pedro Baez to triple A please please please. It’s not working I love him but I don’t see the confidence imo
@Siennagold You too thanks!
@Siennagold Gave you a follow 😘 thanks for the support 🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
@Siennagold Thank you 🙏
I must agree 😎 if memory serves me right we had one like in 88 or 90’s it was extra innings I think till like 1 or 2 AM https://t.co/2PZ1JNmi53

@pebbles2day Thanks so much 😎
@pebbles2day Thanks Pebbles. You remember me thanks so much for changing my life around I mean that 😎
@Howard_Cole In other words we need him less running out there in the OF keep him at 1st we need his bat and he show us plenty of times he has 1st coverd
@Howard_Cole I hope they keep Bellinger at 1st he’s young &amp; it’s his time. 6’ 4” only 22 yrs old the kid is gr8. Not in the OF 2 much field out there.
My family :( https://t.co/gZyjp4xzYK
My family I’m so worried 😔 https://t.co/VyGutRG5LM
@Howard_Cole I love Baez but he has been struggling u can see it. He needs to either go to OKC (Triple A) or get traded. He’s been giving up back 2 backs
@Howard_Cole The Baron was a great pitcher.
@Howard_Cole 😎❤️ https://t.co/5vRmnmxvI7

@TheRealJHair You know better bro! It's just I don't want Bellinger hurt again :( I love Gonzo too so it's a hard decision.
@TheRealJHair but I respect Roberts call. Just adding my two cents. Much love bro!
@TheRealJHair just my two cents I think Dodgers should leave Bellinger at 1st it will keep him from getting hurt in my opinion. We need him.
I'm never jumping off that ship either @TheRealJHair you said it right. I been forever a Dodger fan and will continue to. We got this!
DM sent! Thanks! https://t.co/vlHLdUiPhb

@TheRealJHair aww thanks so much Jerry that meant a lot to me love ya bro. Thanks so much for following me #DodgersFanForLife God bless you!
But NASCAR I love you too. Glad you guys gave me an opp. Wish I could've done both.
Use to out run the throw to first with a bunt down the 3B line. Never struck out it was a once in a blue moon deal. A gift wasted.
No lie I could've playd n the majors but I chose something else 🙄. I ran a 4.24 in the 40. Was good on the O &amp; D. Always reached on base.
@JunesMyx Wow the "ATL" crew loved that movie 😎
@LouisePayneUK Thank you 😘
@LouisePayneUK Good never doubt yourself... you are loved!
@_grammar_ Meant to type that too ughhh. Guess I'm tired 😴

@LouisePayneUK I thank you so much for the great words 😎
I will fight till the end. I don't know what it is to be a kid I was an adult from young. Well on that note good nite I love you all!
God will heal me from all hate I receive from many ppl from the day I were born to now. God will strengthen me and prepare for a stronger me
I got ready 4 school 1 day &amp; overheard my father say to my mom i was a mistake 2 this 🌎. I guess dat was my test from day1. God will prevail
I need to be stronger as my dad never had a son 2 dad relation with me i was beat, slaved, held hostage n a hot van. Beat 50x bare n a row
In the everyday life I live in there's always hate against me. Sometimes it's hard to ignore but i try hard to look past it. I'm use to it!
Geared up ready to go, I'm expected back in two weeks. Ready to capture some 🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
@TheRealJHair I think Cody should remain at 1st. It has his name written all over it but who am i to say?
Much love @TheRealJHair I agree on a lot u say! Keep up the good work! PS that was a foul ball in "The Old-Timers game" by the way, just kdn
Dodgers need to keep @Cody_Bellinger a Dodger for life the young man is talented on d &amp; o &amp; he's my favorite. Keep him at 1st pls Mr Roberts
@RavensHome I think we all waiting for Raven to find out Booker has visions and vice-versa. Can't wait!
@RavensHome @JasonMaybaum Happy Birthday young one!
Great players and @Cody_Bellinger needs to stay at 1st base just my opinion. Let the youth begin now. https://t.co/qFRiB4rvdv
@realnedcolletti been a dodger fan since young and he is one of the best Bellinger all around. Also Austin Barnes very consistent hitter 😎 https://t.co/TNYstBu2gi
@realnedcolletti I think @Cody_Bellinger at 1st is a great move and he should stay there perm. nothing against Hernandez. But we need youth.
Don't get me wrong but @Cody_Bellinger I really love the fact you're at 1st starting and your hitting is on point. You're the spark!
