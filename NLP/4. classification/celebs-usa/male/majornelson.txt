@JayFrechette Deal !
What the @Respawn team has done with the in-game communications ping system is fantastic. The ease at which you can easily issue non-verbal, crisp clear contextual &amp; directional call-outs is a system that makes a solid game even better.
@JayFrechette Was that your team that just wiped our #ApexLegends squad?

@Reese_Rogers Great. Let me know if it works!
@Reese_Rogers Safari on iOS is choking on the page. Until we can get that optimized for Safari, try Edge or Chrome on iOS...they appear to handle a table of 700+ items on sale much better.
@abrotherston Same to you! Next time be sure to say hello.
@Tharnis71 @LocoMvO If you are on iOS - we‚Äôre seeing issues where Safari no likes the page (too many games on sale) Edge (and maybe Chrome) on iOS seem to handle it better. We‚Äôre trying to fix it though!
@PChatGaming @sagitbob3 @TheR1DE It works in Edge for iOS.
@abrotherston Was that you with your daughter and wife?  You should have said hello! Safe travels.
@sagitbob3 @TheR1DE We are troubleshooting. From what we‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs simply too many items in the table and iOS/Safari choke on it. Android/Chrome is handling it a bit better.

The great Twitter Follower purge of 2018 has struck. Looks like I lost about 200k followers (bots?)
@Stumb1in @Radeon I have a 1080 already.  I wanted to try the latest Radeon - plus my monitor supports FreeSync so I've got that now
@Maximum_Clutch @Radeon I have one of those as well. I wanted to try the latest Radeon - plus my monitor supports FreeSync so I've got that now
My nerdy Saturday: Adding the latest @Radeon RX Vega 64 to my home gaming PC and run some of those Play Anywhere titles through their paces. As a bonus, I get to finally use FreeSync on my monitor.
Getting ready to do a little homework. Hope everyone has a great weekend - enjoy the #WorldCupFinal https://t.co/kfJ9dl0m67
