@freeflyingJules @samswey You’re right in that kids being shot is no laughing matter, but the current prez rambling on often can be, esp. about a far-fetched idea that will never come to pass and if it did would almost certainly make things worse
@freeflyingJules That didn’t happen in this case, the armed officer @ Parkland HS didn’t confront shooter and just resigned. “After Columbine over 10,000 school police officers were hired in case a school shooting happened. 2 decades later, they haven't stopped a single school shooting.” @samswey

I accept Trump has been elected president. I do not accept what he represents and intends for this country. What #notmypresident means to me
@VanJones68 thank you - stay emotional, be that voice on your network. Very hard to "come together" after what this man said and did to win
While I have some different opinions, these guys get it right, and were right about this. Please watch them instead of CNN for awhile https://t.co/xgrrmwKGnu

Newly discovered positions for Cali liberals: states rights and abolish the Electoral College!
@rossgolan they go low, we get angry.
Two positives: 1) progressives are galvanized and 2) he's probably not as truly conservative as what he had to say to win this thing
@SugarcultMarko let's keep that in our hearts - but get pissed off when we need to. We didn't enough this time - the other side did.
@dancleary79 sadly, that wouldn't do it. We need a pissed off, impolite liberal willing to "go low" when we need it. Like Warren.

requires several safeguards such as seatbelts to protect myself and others. And insurance is required.   Seems like pretty sound logic to me
In both cases the vehicle and I are logged and monitored by the government with regular check-ins and verifications for safety. The law
stringent restrictions on driving, let alone owning, a larger, more potentially dangerous vehicle such as a semi or bus or helicopter.
I need to be pass a test and have taken a reasonable number of hours of training to drive a normal ordinary vehicle. There are much more

"@nickruth31: Haha. RT @MikeDelRio: Does ANYONE enjoy Comping vocals?" I'd add tuning and fixing/de-essing to that too!
Forgot that "updating Blackberry software" sometimes means wiping Blackberry and reinstalling all apps.  So what's this iPhone thing again?
@graceandmanners jeez I didn't mean that. I don't think I'd want to be that clever
They say don't judge a book by it's cover, but when @RollingStone makes a mass murderer look like a rock star on theirs, I sorta have to.
Thanks for all the Facebook, Twitter, Friendster, telegram, and raven birthday wishes e'rbody!!

Having a great fourth - and I truly wish every one of you the same!
At Staples Center watching one of my all time fave songwriters and guitarists SHREDDING - Lindsey Buckingham and the Mac. As in Fleetwood.

The supermoon is pretty super. Go look at it, America.

I should take a break from working on this song to watch Game 7 , I remember staying up late @ 10 yrs old to catch lakers/pistons game 7
Man. James G is gone. Have been a fan of his work since True Romance. He'll be missed.
Pops day with the pop and the grandpop. Man of steel and pf changs. A pretty perfect day. #happyfathersday

Thank you #theoffice for being a great companion for almost a decade. Classic finale, gotta go down as one of the best ever.

@ghostbeach dang that billboard must have been pricey. Good thing you can pay for it with all the $$ you make when people pirate your music!
Fun day on the slopes - playing rock on them that is. Thanks @931jackfm for the show! I'm sunburnt now
@eve6ers yes this is correct we are playing this show. I'll make sure the sites got it up

@ghostbeach hey can you follow me for a second so I can send you a PM with a question?  Gracias!

The Pope stepped down today, first time that's happened in 600 years.  To be fair he's 85 - 600 years ago avg human life span was about 40!
I saw a squirrel try to jump up a tree and fail today.  He sort of fell off and ran away. I didn't know that happened in nature.

@TRAPT_Street_TM @eve6max @jonsiebels #curtain - We'll see!  This one just came out today so it'll be a few months!
@JustTrox #curtain We're happy with both videos. We had to come out with a more traditional one 1st - this was fun to do something different
@jeffrey999 @eve6max #curtain we had a bunch of old vinyl to use, but that became our lucky one as the day went on so we stuck with it
@TRAPT_Street_TM @eve6max @jonsiebels #curtain We shot right at the Long Beach marina
@R_Behr @eve6max @jonsiebels #curtain I prepped some backwards audio that Max painstakingly learned phonetically by heart. It was superhuman
@JustTrox @eve6 #curtain it was definitely a tough choice, each one had different bits that people liked.
@karalou99 we did 5 full takes on camera, but several walkthroughs with props and extra, and lots of rehearsal leading up to it. Max killed!
We're happy to be back in SoCal - so come be happy with us tonight at 4th &amp; B in San Diego and tomor night at the El Rey in LA!

Excellent rehearsal today. It's almost like we could go make an album soon or something.  First: off to the Wolve Den to see a wolve or two
Tomorrow is @Eve6 's last rehearsal before hitting the studio.  Sort of sad that this phase is coming to an end...NOT!! It's about time!!
If anybody didn't get the email, hang tight for a day or two while we set it up and you'll be able to re-enter your email for the free track
Off to the home state for a show and a maternal visit.  I've missed MI
Congrats @graceandmanners !! And RIP clarence, the sax will never be the same.

I love how Idol is bringing the concept of in-ear monitors to the masses.  Yes kids, they can be difficult to get used to!
I like Idol cuz it celebrates music and covers many different genres and classic songs. And J Lo is gorg and Tyler is rad. Proud Idol-er!

Ok I got more @ replies when I tweeted about Call of Duty than any tweet before.  I knew I should have stuck with computers. Doh!
So the reason for news vans and long lines outside best buy and game stop? Am I to assume its for the new call of duty? Out of vid game loop
@graceandmanners I wanted to see that. Don't recommend?  127 Hrs 2night??
Tamarind sag paneer, staff of the Gem Hotel, 4am nyc bar call = win. Having to fly home in a middle seat today = fail.

At burbank airport on way to NYC, and Meg Whitman's bus is right behind us. Not sure what I think of that
Ok tom selleck started whooping ass and it's getting better. But its all about robots which are, you know, so '84.

#neverletmego movie pretty damn great. Still recommend book 1st, and it's best to know nothing about it when u start. Avoid movie previews
Trying to tear through book version of "never let me go" in time to catch movie while its in theaters. Killer read. #neverletmego
Heard some disgustingly good singing last night, mostly courtesy of @lprock. This gal has more pipes than the LA DWP!!
One of those days in which I'm still sleepy after 4 cups of 101 cafe coffee and a seattle's best latte. I'll try 'bucks next
@samanthabarbera I second that

John mayer quit twitter. This is inspiring me to quit something. Any suggestions?
Just heard mike portnoy is now the drummer of avenged 7x. He's one of the few men that could handle that gig. Dream theater foreva!
@RossSheingold remarkably good I can live with
About to see a priemere of Nikita, a show someone I know is on. I liked the og frenchie and bridget fonda, hope they land the hat trick!
@RossSheingold we have to delete about 5 comments a day on band page from folks excited to tell people about the new ipod they just bought
Watch it with the spam, Facebook.  It's starting to infest your webwaves and I don't like it.
@samanthabarbera is apparently a superhearer, and I am a mere garden-variety hearer
This trip to Maine has been one silly obstacle after another.  We're laughing and crying simultaneously.  Details on our next EVElog
@thetruck we'll channel your spirit when we play open road. Too bad u can't make it, but I don't blame you if its like a 10 hour drive
A rare Delta flight. I discovered "I Shouldn't Be Alive" on Discovery - blew through a 4 hour flight like it was nuthin. My new fave show.
I'm glad no innocent folks got hurt, but aren't there more evil channels than Discovery to rail against?  E! comes to mind...
@JDel I bought that record. A couple decent tunes and some filler to my ears. Sorry boys
The rumors are true: 12 hours of sleep makes you feel like a million bucks. I deserved after marathon recording session w/ @samanthabarbera
Lots of chuckles recording w/ @samanthabarbera. Feels very Cartwright Ave/dungeon/2005. Laughing at my sound libraries and keyboard riffs
Oh Weezer - naming your album Hurley and putting a pic of Lost's Hurley on the cover on iTunes. Maybe Eve 6 album #4 will be "Sun and Jin"
I remember being told to keep quiet about something, but I can't tell if I dreamt this or if it was real.  Mum's the word to be safe.
Great scott its hot today. Can't wait 2 be in my non-AC studio for 12 hours. Heat does moisten vocal chords and makes for easier singing tho
I always run into my bud @jamiearentzen at coffee bean. Great guitarist from american hi-fi that played with the Sugi Tap for a time!
Want to see what a tweet looks like on this new ubertwitter. Ahh lovely.
Ladybug in our dressing room. Hi there friend. http://tweetphoto.com/40558525
I always stay up all night working on tracks before a flight. I forget what its like 2 have full motor control while on an plane. Nap time!
Sad that Entourage is ending next year. Tonights was the best ep of the year so far. Every one on there is just so darn lovable!
Ever read thru ur old tweets?  I just fully entertained myself for a half hour doing that.  Narcissist.
Just rediscovered playing iTunes thru the network 2 my living room speakers. Everyone - music is not meant to be heard thru laptop speakers!
Best character on Entourage for those wondering
Yes!!! The return of Billy Walsh!!
Recorded some soaring vocals with @ryangillmor today. The man has quite the range. Good times
I love that Nada Surf "Inside Of Love" is on the Starbucks playlist every day I come in here. Great song from a great album by a great band

There is justice in the world.  Goodbye and good riddance, Proposition 8.
Go check out Ryan Star's new album 11:59, released today!  My boy Max co-wrote some tunes on there, and they are tasty!
Stephen Tyler, Courtney Love, and Paula Abdul - a potential new Am Idol judge lineup.  That's so ridiculous it might just be entertaining.
It's official: The Core might be my favorite so-bad-it's-good movie, chock full of unintentional hilarity!!

Starbucks sandwiches at airports are markedly worse than the ones elsewhere, but with blueberry muffins it's the opposite. What gives?
It went from a gorgeous day to something far from that in about 5 minutes here in AL. Hopefully we're not rained out!
Hey southern friends, check us out in Alabaster, Alabama tomorrow evening!!
Standing at Sound City Studios where @eve6 recorded our first album in '97. I'm trippin a little bit. http://tweetphoto.com/25454979
newish bands I'm digging at this moment: we were promised jetpacks, yeasayer, a silent film, manchester orchestra (this one not that new)
May was a sucky month for awesome: Dio, Gary C, Dennis, oil spillage, Sex and the City 2. Here's hoping June is an improvement
Why does Gary Sinise in Mission to Mars look like he just got off stage at a drag show and is in mid-makeup removal?
29 million gallons of oil spilled in the Gulf. That's almost the amount of records that "Thriller" sold. This is a lot of slick.
Anyone that bought tickets will get a full refund and we promise to come back through Florida and make it happen. Sorry again guys!!
So sorry 2 all folks planning on going to the FL shows this weekend: we were forced to cancel due to dealings with the show promoter. Sorry!

My heart rate seems to climb...Lost finale only 7 hours away
@matthewbair 3 cups is my limit
@graceandmanners I'm definitely on the "Observe & Report" team. Gets better with every viewing. Awesome is a good word for it.
@EmilyOsment http://tweetphoto.com/23416806 have you seen guy trapped in an elevator for 42 hours on Youtube?  Mas disturbing...
We're recording!  Details here: http://bit.ly/91I1ZN
I finally opted out of all those incessant credit card and insurance mail offers. I feel my Green points and peace of mind both increasing
Now Dio really is gone. May the metal god rest in peace!
@MichelleNW @samanthabarbera see that's what happen's when you rely on Twitter as your source of news. Long live Ronnie James!!!
Dang Dio died?  That's sad.  I'm seeing a band in LA that would probably call him an influence.
Hard core bleu cheese - and at first its like, mmm tasty, then all of a sudden it's like, oh, this tastes like my 8th grade jock strap
I don't think they make chopsticks like they used to.  They keep breaking uneven and I end up with splintery lump at the bottom of 1 stick.
Nothing. I must have dreamt them. RT @Oobrandy333: @eve6tony albums? What're those?
@Oobrandy333 tuesday's also good for new albums coming out. Although given album sales nowadays I think people are more pumped about Lost
Pretty psyched to be all caught up with "Lost" - I can watch tomorrow's episode in real time.  Probably won't understand it any more though.
Our Southwest airplane is a bit broken and we stuck in Indy. I'd rather be late than flying in a broken plane though, don't want Lost sitch
@eve6max and I each tried to communicate with only one word each for a few minutes. Mine was "wyndham", his was "wabash". Sort of worked.
@ErinTridle Indiana. So that's why, we're close
The weather out here has been strange. Balmy and calm one minute, torrential downpour the next. Now its freezing wind. What's next?
@matthewbair show tonight was awesome - she was just showin sum punk 'tude. Plus the lighting storm overhead was dope!
First time in Pittsburgh since the "incident". Longtime Eve 6 fans will know what I'm talkin bout
@listn2billhicks just high fived my friend Shayla unprovoked and it goes against everything he stands for. This is a big deal.

Oh come now people, I tried to make it funny...and also reveal a few new song titles...but hey it's all OK. April Fools folks!! Hahahahaha
The Oxygen Network version of "Can't Buy Me Love" switched "You shit on my house!!" to "You hit on my house!!". Total bullhit.

@MichelleNW I must have missed it. I'm kind of hooked now unfortunately...it's set in my home town, the 313, the D, Detroit!
Wow - there's a reality show about parking enforcers called Parking Wars. Is it fun watching people argue over getting parking tickets?
@ReiDemon true, but no one plays with Transformers anymore either. With the right marketing $$ they can resuscitate the GPK brand
Driving in van listening to Paul Westerberg to KC for three days off. I wonder how we'll spend the time?
@matthewbair I want tickets
I certainly will, it's awesome! Everyone should own a decent pink hat.  RT @pick1orelse: @eve6tony I hope you enjoy my tab hat!
Not saying I liked Transformers (or any Michael Bay movie for that matter) - just saying a GP Kids movie is a good marketing move
I'm talking about full-blown, big budget, modern take on G.P. Kids, a la Transformers. Not sure if it would be any good, but it'll make $$$
I just had an idea - Garbage Pail Kids: The Movie. When is this gonna happen?

These olympic skiers are ridonkulous. Now that I ski (very badly) I have a new appreciation. Fast is cool.

Its funny when you open a catering tray that says "Vegetable Medley" and there's nothing in there but rows and rows of asparagus.

"What if there is no tomorrow?  There wasn't one today!"  Happy GH Day.
To anyone coming to our Louisville show in a couple weeks we'll be debuting a new song. Turn your ears on!
Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood's new clothing line is homeless-themed. Zoolander "Derelicte"?! Its actually happened!!
My new toothbrush feels like a procupine attacking my gums.
Damn, started raining again.  Bye bye leather goods.
I like being inside when it rains. I like being outside when it rains less.
New term for the world: Banana + Enema = Bananema.  It helps to picture it.

I think I'm gonna do some mindsmiling right now.
Arrgh my emails stopped pushing to my Blackberry.  It is the end of the world as I know it.  How did we live before 'Berries in like 2002??
I love the Apple Store. And it loves me considering the $$ I shell out here on a regular basis.
I just skied for the first time ever. 5 year old kids were whizzing by at a breakneck pace. Someday that will be me!
Arghh. Power outage at my house. I was almost finished with a new demo too. Guess I'll go to Starbucks!
At Starbucks and the guy next to me is watching "It" with Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown. It gave me nightmares for weeks when I was a kid
At Laurel Tavern sitting at the only communal table bar that exists in Los Angeles as far as I know.  There should be more of these.
@graceandmanners - I'm more of a January Jones type of guy. Challenged!
Watching my friends Rocket at the Viper Room. Their new drummer is the best I've seen in years.
I love being in a Starbucks at 9:30 am because its such a rare treat for me. Even though I'm so tired I want to crawl into a cave and die
At Tacos Villa Corona in Silverlake. This place comes highly recommended by mr Jerry
Ate at Yaki's today, 1st time in yrs.  Our old haunt, where we carved the band name into a table which appeared on the cover of album #3
Funny how at LA shows about 30% of the people drink and chat in the lobby for the whole show.
Walking in to see everyone's favorite supergroup, Them Crooked Vultures, in LA at the Wiltern.

Random trip so far, running into all sorts of folks I know, @laurenc from the awesome Rocket and Brad H from 3EB!!
On my southwest flight to Vegas today I'm # A4. This may be my highest position to date!  Shooting for A1...someday, someday....
LA clouds are dope today
I love when @eve6max tweets unprovoked. Damn I kinda miss airports right now...I think I've totally taken leave of my senses.
Its a beautiful day for a walk for juvenile diabetes. Go JDRF!
Up @ 8:30am on a Sunday to do a charity walk around Dodger Stadium. Telling myself through the AM pain "Its for the kids, for the kids..."
@rdgroyalgirl yes, thnx for the blast from the past. Please destroy that picture now.
@legalseafoods The meal was wonderful! My band Eve 6 are huge fans of the restaurant. I was just relating a humorous thing our server said.
Pretty nuts: when I mentioned the legal sea foods allergy thing, the company actually responded to me directly!
"Any food allergies for the gentlemen?" - our legal seafoods guy
Got to Boston Logan Airport early with @eve6max and @listn2billhicks to eat Legal Seafood.
I told you this shamwow thing rocked.
Just landed in windy city. Showed my "lil bro" @matthewbair "The Departed" - that flick gets me every time.
Whoops meant @davenavarro6767
Gonna listen to my good friend Dan (@graceandmanners) do his radio show with @davenavarro. Its quite funny. Dark Matter 10-12, indie103.com

"A change will do you good" - Sheryl Crow (and lots of other people that have said it before her)

Our flight to Cedar Rapids IA. I tried to fit the dudes in, who are sitting one by one behind me in a column - no go http://pic.gd/591a9b
I wonder what @eve6max is gonna tweet about...
Didn't go to bed at all last night. Worked on a song until 9am, at which point I had to pick everybody up to go to the airport 4 gig in Iowa
Rodney Bingenheimer at Canter's Deli just now. For those who don't know him, he's an LA legend, the original KROQ DJ, and a friend to music
Congrats to @emilyosment, #alltherightwrongs is the #15 pop album on iTunes right now.
#funnystuffivedone - bought three bottles of Jack Daniels and a 6-pack of O'Doul's Non-Alcoholic Beer to confuse the check-out person

TLC Punk #oneletteroffmovies
@emilyosment song "All The Way Up" #9 on Rad Dis Countdown chart.  Way to go dude! Excited for her debut EP "All The Right Wrongs" out Tues
Everyone assumes that I was doing something to annoy this woman: not true. She was nuts! She kept pointing her AC at my neck and blasting it
Wish I had more room to tell everyone about the crazy woman sitting behind me on this flight. She kept trying to pick a fight with me!
My magazine with January Jones on the cover got stolen at Burbank Airport. I'm cursed! Shades, phone, mag, all in the space of two weeks!
First post from my new phone. Its good to be back in the saddle again. Come see us @ Rowan U in NJ this weekend!
Aimee Mann sitting in front of me at Starbucks. "Voices Carry" is still a world-class song. She's got some beautiful solo work as well.
4 hrs of sleep make Tony a dull boy
Trying to work but the Dark Ages special on History Channel HD is making it difficult.  Damn, life sucked in Western Europe in 700 AD!
Have a new phone.  Same #.  Won't be able to do data stuff (bbm, email, twitter etc) from it for a day or two.
Someone stole my phone (along with @eve6max's) right from dressing room in NH.  Show rocked nonetheless!
@Eve6MediaHQ @beglebite the site should launch in preparation for the album, which will come in 2010
I'm not a Dodgers fan particularly, but go Blue!

Just watched the very first Sequel show with @matthewbair at the Mint on Pico. I believe Rihanna just arrived. Ahhh LA...
Taking pictures in H-wood. Someone stole my sunglasses after setting them down for one minute. Damn!
Photo shoot today in Hollywood. Last time we did one was in beautiful Schaumburg, Illinois on about 2 hours of sleep. More rested this time!
We jammed. A good time was had. Finishing a new Eve 6 tune this week that's dare I say somewhat sexy.
Gonna do some jamming today...and our buddies The Sequel (@matthewbair) and Emily Osment (@emilyosment) will both coincidentally be there!
I've been trying 2 work but instead have been BBMing pals the whole time. So many distractions through which to navigate in our digital era!
Studio Eve 6 demo heaven/hell.  Back in the trenches.  I was just here dammit!
Mayfair Market salads do a body good.  I knew I'd get a salad-related Tweet going one of these days.
Everyone go check out Push Play's new album "Found" out today on iTunes. Our compadre @matthewbair wrote some tunes on it!
Kitchen 24 and a couple movies/Entourage are a fun way to reset after mini-tour. Back to work tomorrow.
Landed from long feeling flight. I wonder what we'll eat in the Dallas airport?  Beautiful red sky sunset.
Great FL show. Sitting in restaurant where the ENTIRE ceiling is covered in hanging dollar bills. There must be over 100K in here.
Max and I about to eat a redonkulous amount of seafood last night. I'm gonna grow claws during the show... http://pic.gd/7eecf6
Wow. 4:30am pickup for 8:30am flight to Florida. Glamorous.

Afternoon starbucks regimen. Its way crowded today. Then music work. Maybe catch a flick with some folks tonight. Fly to Florida on friday.

Back and forth mixing a new Eve 6 demo...I suspect elements of this demo will be on the actual release
I missed the VMAs.  Youtube time.
@graceandmanners unfortunately I heard it wasn't good at all :/
LAX for the umpteenth time. 14 hrs of travel makes Tony a dull boy.
Why does Green Bay have a professional football team but also an airport with absolutely zero things to eat?
@ctryan25 we are not. Playing northern MI on friday though. That must be a mistake on our Facebook, we'll remove it promptly
I saw 22 black widows in ten minutes last night, no joke. I never knew the Valley was such a breeding ground.

About to enjoy the new Pixar gem "Up". I hear some eve6ers say I should use "ubertwitter" instead of "twitterberr". What's the advantage?
