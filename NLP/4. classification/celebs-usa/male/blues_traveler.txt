@CIntoTheVoid ...which is nice... 😉
@historylvrsclub Bottom row third guy in from the right...only guy smiling... #farted
@LTaxin '81Bonneville...burnt umber...
@LTaxin I remember that...we could infact see them...☺️
@MESanders ....&amp;yes hot delicious cheese beats almost anything🤔
@MESanders John Popper stole all of my footwear while I slept&amp;replaced it w/exactly identical footwear so that no one would believe me story!🤨
@farmerlbilly @andrew_michels Oh I am likely the wrong guy to ask...I never seem to know...but I do ask that very question each&amp;every day....☺️
@VelvetSeaWader @hello_jodie @paytheslacker @jack @TwitterSupport According to who ms. Rev Jim Jones?🤔
@LadyLakeMusic Deets soon!! ☺️
@LadyLakeMusic Yes my lady!!...😘❤️
@mikelowetpt &amp;Ur sage wisdom drips from Ur every orafice...☺️
@andrew_michels Okay...yes sir!
@SkipMartin1 I seem to work in that millue...😉
@paytheslacker @hello_jodie @VelvetSeaWader @jack @TwitterSupport Now I don't think I know all the details😂
@Ramyourphace @VelvetSeaWader @jack @TwitterSupport An excellent point right there Phil!!
@SkipMartin1 @gratefulmaggzzz @MooseMuses Alright I'm audie5000...plane's landing I think we've really made some progress here...☺️
@hello_jodie @VelvetSeaWader @jack @TwitterSupport Be in Ur neck of the woods in july🥳🥰
@SkipMartin1 @gratefulmaggzzz @MooseMuses I am not going to say that due to the rampant misogyny in our culture...but U almost got me to agree...
@heyscottyb ...it seemed to rile up ms. Macarthy at the time...so it created alot of entertaining vitriol...&amp;besides we got a chance to chat...so I don't see it as a loss or a gain...there is water&amp;a glass...full or empty is all dependent on what U're selling at the time...But Ur point holds
@SkipMartin1 Apparently that's going around...🙄
@hello_jodie @VelvetSeaWader @jack @TwitterSupport I love U Jodie...they just wanted to feel important...miss U😘
@MooseMuses @SkipMartin1 Awwww pookums...did U get my message from doinky?...🤣🤣🤣🤣😘
@SkipMartin1 @gratefulmaggzzz @MooseMuses And my guys are lazy tweeters&amp;love contraversy☺️
@SkipMartin1 @gratefulmaggzzz @MooseMuses U are correct sir!!
@LTaxin 😂
@LTaxin @heyscottyb @andrew_michels Word&amp;ever foward!! ✊😎
@brian_riback @VelvetSeaWader @jack @TwitterSupport ❤️✊☺️
@LTaxin Me niether...I can't wait to tell U what we intend to do this summer...but I have to wait a day...I'm trying ti listen to my management...But they'd rather I just keep off twitter in the first place...😂 #prollysmart
@heyscottyb @LTaxin Take it slow Scott✊
@heyscottyb @LTaxin Yeah that was a fucked up article...
@D_Sull93 @phreba @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 So who U mad at Danny?😃
@D_Sull93 @phreba @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 Popper is a hebrew name actually meaning "messenger of bright" but not on twitter😂😂
@D_Sull93 @phreba @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 No I'm actually jewish on my grandfather's side!!😂 My nephew is bc his mother is but we are a big mish mash of catholics&amp;jews from eastern europe&amp;western europe..and I find it a beautiful faith which is what is annoying about ms. stalin trying to accuse victimhood here but hey🙄
@LTaxin @heyscottyb U're cool&amp;we should be able to take it...I hope U're okay aswell 😉
@CIntoTheVoid @VelvetSeaWader Forgot to shout out to the Un fans out there😂
@CIntoTheVoid @VelvetSeaWader Now there's an empress of spelling!?🤣😂 If U find ms. edie amiN dada upstanding perhaps she should deport herself that way... #dontstartnuffingwouldntbenuffing 😂 seriously U guys are fun☺️
@SkipMartin1 @MooseMuses 😂😂😳
@MESanders I've actually done that😖😂😂
@69mangoman &amp;U probably won't hear "Mangoman has a gf"🤣🤣 No but for real congrats on that oscar for Mosts mangos sold😂😂😂😂😂
@SkipMartin1 ...sat in w/Moe while somebody was apparently tripping...I do have some nerve🧐
@VelvetSeaWader @jack @TwitterSupport I see no misogyny or anti-semitism here chairman mao...but I suspect U see alot of adversaries where non exist...&amp;that leads me to the same question U raise...🤔
@heyscottyb @LTaxin U seem a nice fellow Scott&amp;I like talking music too...but I have to say it almost never comes up on this medium...Twitter was designed for the "zinger" or one liners&amp; the venting of alot of peoples frustrations...kind of a loud yet silent scream therapy for Ur fingers... ☺️
@LTaxin &amp;thanx for saying the other nice stuff&amp;I can handle any bad stuff...its all good...its twitter I still don't know U...☺️
@LTaxin I ask for no defense...but thanx for offering☺️
@VelvetSeaWader Thank U for being the sheriff of vibes madame dear leader kim jong un...We must all obey Ur sensibility or surely we are the problem...😂...maybe just a little more whiskey?...then we won't be able to understand all of Ur complaining...U are a fun emperess of fun🙄☺️
@decaturkater @VelvetSeaWader @2chix1fightbell Did U go off?...Let me help...☺️
@heyscottyb @LTaxin ...so I would stand by the comparison...the absurd aspect to which they have chosen to miss the point&amp;remain offended is entirely theirs&amp;seems funny to me...😂I hope that answers Ur query...but again,whatever wanks Ur crank☺️...
@heyscottyb @LTaxin They were not representing themselves that way...but I believe I was refering to their intolerance of other Phish fans or people that like the same bands they do...as if they own or can define other people by their perseptions alone as if some authority...&amp;on that point they were
@JDDRELLER @heyscottyb We'll see U soon John ☺️
@D_Sull93 @phreba @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 &amp;btw what do U have against going down on someone?🤔....🤣🤣🤣🤣😋
@D_Sull93 @phreba @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 Daniell U are Herman Goring...😂😂 Only half as nuts&amp;twice as boring...😜
@D_Sull93 @phreba @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 U obviously don't read Jim Morrison...Or watch Mel Brookes...But fascists never are willing to embrace a conversational premise so I forgive U Ur dogmatic dismissal of anything that may violate Ur safe space😂But thinking that constitutes a joke tho,U insult the premise of comedy
@sbkelly9 U may count upon it Stu...😉
@heyscottyb @LTaxin Well said!!
@LTaxin ...awww that's sweet...I love to see the dialogue reflecting such depth of character...I guess U can shame anyone U want to...U clearly have a list of acceptable shamees U deem appropriate...😂...some sort of score U're keeping?🤔😂😂😂😂
@sshaikin @VelvetSeaWader 😂
@VelvetSeaWader That constitutes a joke?...U aren't very funny...&amp;I never did get that album back!😂😂😂
@shakedowndown @FirenzeMike @VelvetSeaWader @gratefulmaggzzz Yeah I just didn't know he existed...I took care of it for him☺️
@phreba @D_Sull93 @Damn_Vandal @Doug1348 🤔...yeah

@JamBase @therealkurtvile @nprmusic It's a beautiful song...its about me...as much as its about U or anyone... :) 👍👍
@SBR146 @KelseyCayanne That would be the story of Wendy I'd say,tho the two are fairly codependent I'll grant U...Both stories can be sad depending how far one wishes to take the premise...But there was also love&amp;joy mixed in...as is the case w/ the best tragedy...

@twolinepass @statsrespecter That IS a great song!!...I like them!! :)
@twolinepass @statsrespecter I would but then I gotta log into damn spotify...&amp;I can’t remember my spotify password&amp;then I gotta hit the “i forgot my password” button&amp;then it’s like I’m at the dmv...&amp;I gotta go2work..I would love to hear them...or potentially sue them if they aren’t good...☺️ send a link?
@statsrespecter @twolinepass ...&amp;if U think Ur flesh is so horrible,do something about it... #loveUrself 😂
@statsrespecter @twolinepass Why yes I can...😖
@statsrespecter @twolinepass How ‘bout U?...what do U weigh?
@statsrespecter @twolinepass Well I was 436 pounds in 1999&amp;in 2000 I got the bypass&amp;lost 180pounds in 10 months...then over the next 3years as is standard,I gained 32pounds back&amp; have been holding ever since at a demure 270☺️ ...that’s 20years I was not expecting to have...That surgery really can work!!
@StephanieJEtaug I was talking about the shit U guys got there,but U do got good stuff too... 😉

@fluffhead_sc @TweeterReprise @phish @smashmouth Never gonna happen...I love those guys!!❤️✊😎
@GSarafan @reverenddave Me too man✊🤖
@Music__Mentor @peteforgets @JimCarrey @clarkgregg 😂😂😂
@phishislife04 @thephunion @andrew_michels @JamBase Haha...is that what that is...🤔 It seems more Ur issue than mine but I do appreciate Ur attention...😉
@thephunion @andrew_michels @JamBase Haha!! When U claim an interview is booked bc U tweet it,that’s beyond cowardly...it’s quite silly actually...but if U had an actual job...eh U would be different I suppose 😏
@peteforgets A literary classic 🐧 Thanx for the fingering😜
@GSarafan @reverenddave Whether we wind up creating ultron or jarvis...Kit the night rider car or the Hal9000...we may inevidably be headed to a fate of creating AI whether we mean to or not...which also has implications asto our own existense...
@GSarafan @reverenddave &amp;try to simply recognize it...100 years ago our attitude regarding animals was vastly less empathetic than now...Now we can recognize emotional awareness in most creatures where once culturally they were for our use&amp;little more...I see a similar growth for us w/regards to AI
@GSarafan @reverenddave I was jumping ahead to rights of these intellects...but U are correct the self awareness to write or make something is a trait of true sentiance,but what will surely evolve is our definition of even our own selfawareness as we try to define it in AI
@GSarafan @reverenddave -cancer...who would own the copyright on the intellectual property of what the ship’s computer comes up w/?...I know that in star trek they’ve done away w/money,but we may build machines that create ideas from nothing&amp;that will be an issue,&amp;U know Data is ripe w/ideas #datamining
@GSarafan @reverenddave Well the ship’s computer would be constructed w/a duty to serve,thusly earning it’s keep...it would need the crew to maintain it,presuming it had any motivation for self survival..but let’s take it further,let’s say the ship’s computer writes a song or a play...more likely cures-
@GSarafan @reverenddave In the star trek scenario,Data does deserve rights...”rights themselves” are a construct&amp;product of our own sentience...we can’t have it in ourselves w/out responding to it when we recognize it...it’s the nature of sentience
@GSarafan @reverenddave Concider the movie “Ex Machina” It cuts right to the dark place our intimate relationship w/AI could take us to...just be nice to Ur sexbot
@RedEngines @GSarafan @reverenddave 😂😂😂😂😂😂 #Uarekillingme!!
@ThePrincessDawn I would say Howard Levy...he can literally do things I can’t understand...My favorite these days is fast becoming Frederic Yonnet...Jason Ricci&amp;Charlie Musslewhite...old school? I’m a little walter man... ;)
@RedEngines @GSarafan @reverenddave We’ve always secretly wanted to in some way “fuck” our coolest gadgetry as a species...sex robots is a natural evolution...&amp;then at least my coffee maker wouldn’t be so sticky😂
@zeeman That was as much Ur energy as ours!! Thank U❤️☺️
@GSarafan @reverenddave It still weighs heavily on my mind...have U seen West World!?😳
@JishuaHunter Fuckin’ A brother!! ☺️
@JishuaHunter I can’t seem to DM U...are U following?
@JishuaHunter Yeah we do!!😂
@JishuaHunter Yes we should!! 😂 I’ll put U+1 to get backstage let’s put the crushing weight of this massive beef to bed...DM me&amp;I will find a structure that will hold both of us...
@JishuaHunter But if they started calling U by my name,that’s usually where they’re headed...unless U were playing a harp at the time... :)
@JishuaHunter I would like to state officially that while I have never seen Jishua Hunter in person...I can tell by the typing that only the fingers of the thinnest most physically fit specimine could’ve tweeted these tweets...&amp;Jishua is beautiful regardless of hat choice or head gear... 😉
@JishuaHunter My bad... #Iamadouchebag
@JishuaHunter Oohhhh...well that was more a fat joke at my expense...😂
@saillea Haha thanx...I was trying ☺️
@saillea U are so sweet to say that!!☺️💖💖 Thank U for being much kinder than I or any of us on twitter are...U are just kind!! There is no reason for shame ever!.....unless U’ve comitted arson or something☺️
@JishuaHunter Well U did call me a douche bag...I’m sorry a “crocodile dundee douchebag”...&amp;I merely stated a weight gain was obvious...as was mine...I’ve said many worse things on twitter...it’s twitter...U were at least consistent in Ur point...I can respect that at least...douche bag😉
@davidbowieUB40 @BrodTHEchode69 @kabumped @_dontwakeDADDY_ 😘
@Mafujon I’m glad he did!! ☺️
@mshowalter @SklarBrothers #8 provolone lettuce tomato mayo onions hot peppers...&amp;a place to lie down after...😘
@SteveOKruz @andrew_michels Hell yeah!!...&amp;yes he is,but I’ve trolled a few trolls&amp;even they keep a consistent conviction to some degree usually...but it doesn’t even mean a thing now really...See U in Utica!! ☺️
@TheSteve_Slater Ah yes the front row gang!! That must’ve been a fun car ride home...😂❤️
@_Winterstern_ I guess so...🤔 He didn’t seem the sort...but there it is...who can figure people dilluted down to 200characters anyway...☺️
@Nimsy17 Thanx for saying that tho
@Nimsy17 Hey I’m no day at the beach,belive me...It was just odd to notice the drastic hypocritical change in his tyrade...😉
@jking206 Was happy to meet her&amp;U aswell☺️
@daydreamer2018 😂 it’ll be a big fat success!!
@protonnage Yes but U are an admitted fellow bad punster...This dude was claiming some objective moral high ground...that’s the part that I find the ickiest...own it if U’re to be reprehensible...such hypocrasy is so gross 🙄
@mshowalter @SklarBrothers Haven!!!
@RadioDexter Good point
@RadioDexter I agree,but it’s the wierdest way I’ve ever heard someone attempt to demonstrate their objectivity in a while...It took a wierd hop for him,but again hey I’d rather be able to see my junk than pander 😂 Seems an easy choice even now...
@sharpndpensel Free time?...&amp;I talk to them☺️
@RadioDexter All perfectly viable 2nd careers...😂 I’m still stuck in the same job I’ve had since hs...☺️  I gotta go to work now...later!! ✊😎
@BigBaby95662395 ☺️...it will...
@protonnage I figure,but in an odd way as to make a point...&amp;that’s where I sense confusion on his part...&amp;he wrote it 🤔
@RadioDexter U do it...I’ll back U from the shadowy smoke filled back rooms...
@RadioDexter Oh god me in political office!?😳
@BigBaby95662395 ❤️✌️
@BigBaby95662395 Ha!! Miss U too...please no ass beatings for my sake...✊😎
@campbell_jen ☺️☺️❤️❤️
@RadioDexter I like it!...excellent metaphores
@BigBaby95662395 &amp;btw I appreciate what U’re saying about the world making us fatter,but to the largest degree I made me fat...me...Like any addiction,I gotsta own this...I do happily...☺️
@BigBaby95662395 I wouldn’t slap him,I actually pity him...He doesn’t know how2see himself&amp;needs an enemy2lash out at the exact way he loaths...alot of loathing&amp;it’s not aimed at me really...it’s aimed at his own sense of injustice...like a road rager...Not his finest moment,but I’m a”big boy”😉
@RadioDexter Right...those were the days (blacklists, jim crowe, being gay was a mental problem)...Truman’s era was pretty horrid... But this guy we got now lost me at “mexicans are rapists”&amp;has remained pretty consistent...there is more common ground to oppose that than he could ever divide
@markkendrick 😂😂😂
@RadioDexter &amp;we need each other...if I only had those in total agreement w/me,my world becomes uninteresting&amp;boring really fast...it’s always in the middle we meet...But the fringe extremes have the floor these days...Our history has a sad recording of those times aswell(Know Nothing Party)
I’m not sure of the point he’s making🤔...is it “never be obese while on top20 radio”? Or “Fatten up once U’re off top20radio”? but I’m definitely not as “big” as I was then😁... isn’t this some wierd way2justify fat shaming?..but like from the past. Lucky4me I have no shame☺️ https://t.co/nEupHg0uH5
@Ikejames101 @DeanBlues Well now U’re filling me w/dillusions of grandure but I’m honored at the comparison... #Iwish ☺️
@RadioDexter U&amp;me both...I think the platforms of both parties have failed,but clearly what’s going on now is a lopsided abuse of power by the side in power...
@lizzieorchard 😂
@RadioDexter ...it’s true...
@RadioDexter Amen!!
@GreasyFizeek @DogsInaPile @MoMo_Lives @VelvetSeaWader @MajorTomsCabin_ @blue_traveler Funny part is pot is legal in Wa....but they never gave it back to us...😂
@HokieGuy1996 ✊😎
@decaturkater All real men post their numbers...that’s what manly men do...🤔 Aunt Kate!! When did U get out,we’ve missed U at the ritual cult sacrifices!! Glad to see the meds are working...How’s Uncle Ursla?...did U two finally renovate Ur cell like U were planning? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!
@staci_coelho Always...who else can each of us be? 😘
@BlowUpRadio @andrew_michels See? He’s adorable...☺️ #totesabsorbs
@BlowUpRadio @andrew_michels He also needs no explanation as this is twitter&amp;to troll is his only likely chance,(we are left to presume),he has to express himself w/any semblence of selfconfidence so I try to cut the little scamps a break...I still block them though...
@brcodeman Nice!!
@Nimsy17 😘btw
@mikelowetpt Ah to feel that U are everyone...🤔 I remember that phase of childhood development...😏

@JordanIsley1987 @RoseanneReturns @RoseanneOnABC @therealroseanne @ReelMFishman I wonder myself...I can’t wait to check the show out!!🤔
@LomTasby @SarahKSilverman Sadly there will always be these dangerous things...revolvers are both fun(if U’re sane),but also cause death&amp;are used for murders as are other weapons...Of course we should regulate all weapons...but sadly we too often get hung up on terminology
@LomTasby @SarahKSilverman logistically most rifles owned by civilians today are semiauto...We just gotta express the language correctly...if U want it to pass I mean...There is for instance NO reason for a bumpfire..that can be banned immediately..2ban any gun requires specifics
@LomTasby @SarahKSilverman I do know ranchers that have to cover large areas alone who have to deal w/hogs&amp;coyotes who need a semi auto to deal w/them depending how it’s laid out..&amp;it can be a great choice for hunting..all weapons started out as weapons of war,
@SarahKSilverman But hey it’s always fun to yell at the tv...
@SarahKSilverman I gotta say I think he’s saying it’s a bad bill if U know the legal symantics...It won’t pass...backround checks will,raising the age to get one to age21 will...fuck the bumpstocks,but to effectively illegalize potentially any gun based on style just won’t...😕

@IamJackBoot in today’s work place environment it is likely a dangerous or bad idea to sit anywhere in any type of paramilitary gear or homemade vest “waiting for them to notice”....bc let me tell U once they do...😳    🚓🚓🚓🚓🚓🚓💨

@JohnSeaborn @D2_Derpinator @em_dash01 @pblest I like keeping tabs on U guys..😉
@Jam_Bands @RelixMag @treyanastasio @jfishman600 perhaps in the ambition to write it...or in stringing themes in&amp;out of each other thru out,but frankly it was fairly rudementary in my opinion compared to what Phish pull off...I was proud of the story line though...
@D2_Derpinator @em_dash01 @pblest U gotta know the rules people..😏
@JuddFalin ....hey,herpes is forever...&amp;I find the analogy quite apt here...😂...but thanx for playing...U sound as if U’re praying😉

@chxmicalwarfare @x138x ....look at that!...&amp;not even a doxxing!🤨😂😂
@ClevoZW @kerrence @assbuttOG U have a girlfriend!?..:🤨😂
@x138x @chxmicalwarfare I would say no...bc there’s nothing vainglorious about this...I do like looking for trouble where I shouldn’t,but it’s also the only way to meet The trolls of which U speak...😉
@chxmicalwarfare @x138x I guess U don’t know the whole story...🤨😙
@xashee Hope to see U there!! Happy 18 Shirley!!😘
We are just about sold out on this one...should be by new years eve...I think we can move 10tix by then...A big Mahalo to everybody involved!! We’re having a ball!! :) https://t.co/M2qAqt4ciX

@mfaller finally!!🤘😝
@oldpicsarchive alot of good stuff there!!
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic right!! :)
@WinterWolfMTGO @jjrayn @GemOfMagic well here we are again...U try2give me real dialogue,engaging me in a real way&amp; jjrayn feels insulted by the vanity of it...How else would we have met my friend...Anyway I’m glad we did...thru the detrious&amp;hosility that is twitter ✊😎happy’18!
@jjrayn @WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic I find it a useful way to keep or make contact w/people I would not otherwise meet... But sometimes they are hostile...comes w/the territory I figure...☺️
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic U too man...That’s reasonable what U’re saying...I just learned first hand that this indeed low medium requires a reserve in any judgement in any direction bc actual facts are few&amp;far between w/rage in abundance..&amp;everyone claims an aggrieved status...
@Oinks_n_Squeels @assbuttOG I’d cook U,but who’d eat U?...😂
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic &amp;if U think I doxxed this abhorent stalker w/any joy or w/out seeking all other remedy then I can’t help U,or convince U&amp;as it always has been,I am what U decide&amp;it(as always),is Ur choice asto what power U think I have or what information...it’s all U
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic I’m glad U were...I would give credit for that to U in any case bc it was U who applied any meaning or power to what I made or had anything to do w/making...it is our connection that gives any of it power...I am a reflextion of Ur meaning...
@Chandrathan @assbuttOG ah twitter...
@assbuttOG &amp;there U go Forrest...U’re in a sense still doing it...But again that’s the nature of twitter...&amp;U shouldn’t threaten to assault people on it...that is one of the rules..🙄...U do sound totally rational&amp;not the least bit angry or anything...😂
@Duderibe @assbuttOG thank U for proving my point...😂
@jjrayn @WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic 😘
Merry New Year Everybody!!🎅RT @RelixMag: .@blues_traveler's John Popper talks working with @treyanastasio on creating a "Divided Sky for Christmas" and why he wants a vacuum duel with @jfishman600 :: https://t.co/qyWMxlmUDb https://t.co/BR4fUeUs46
@real_avocados @SaltyGary Phil,U seem troubled this holiday season...pray tell me,what could ever be the matter at this glorious time of yule!?...🤔
@philgalletto @travisalxndr @thronewatches in Bushwick!? We would love to hit that place again!!!
@assbuttOG 😴...here we go again...does that account even exist anymore?😂
@philgalletto @travisalxndr @thronewatches do they make thrones or watches?
@assbuttOG -3rd,U mentioned brought my wife&amp;child into it by name..aren’t U gonna be a father?..U stalked me hard on twitter for 4 yrs&amp;now U have no bot&amp;U must behave like a timid mouse on this twitter handle U’ve eaked out for Urself..I’m fine but are U? U still sound very mad😉
@assbuttOG 1.) U’re sort of still here&amp;thanx for following btw..but twitter banned U in some form&amp;they are indeed wise 2.) U did dox first beyond all of Ur news stories&amp;heavy campaining to the contrary as Ur little group of friends provided me w/the pic of my own house Forrest,&amp;-
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic Paul,U are the one who is having trouble listening to my band..I don’t think I’m the one who’s bitter... :) Idk what Jeremy did or didn’t do,but I can&amp;did speak on what happened to me...It’s only twitter tho&amp;I’m not the one casting judgements,U are☺️
@travisalxndr @philgalletto ☺️
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic No the point of performing is not to inform unless U are doing the NY Times on ice...I always thought performing was more a howling at the moon/raging against the dying of the light kinda deal...As long as U mean it...U never knew who I “once was”☺️
@philgalletto @travisalxndr 🤨☺️
@travisalxndr @philgalletto ...that one’s on U... 😉
@gratefulmaggzzz @fluffhead67 @thejurisdoctor 🤘🤪
@philgalletto @travisalxndr 😳
@Micahson55 @KFCBarstool @KFCradio thanx man... :)
@WinterWolfMTGO @GemOfMagic Um...he did that first&amp;would not stop untill I recipricated...so I agree...&amp;it’s a shame it came to that&amp;his getting thrown off twitter...but all the same,I’d rather U didn’t listen as U are so poorly informed...🙄

@excitedstate “waiting”...not “grading”...but maybe U’re a teacher...#honoredinanyevent☺️
@StretchRothman @KilljoyGSW Dwayney &amp;the BronBron?...
@lukievan @ditzkoff 😂At least he took my advice about greedily consuming scotch...that is actually “lesson#3”....but at a press conference!?🤔....🙄

@shawnwatson1985...why ruin it for U...Had I even known at the time,(or U really☺️),I wouldn’t’ve spoiled it for U...
@JasonAssholes @assbuttOG @daveanthony ....that’s kinda the point...😉 It’s our new “tough sell” approach to self marketing&amp;we tend to think it’s been working out great!☺️

@assbuttOG @LuigiThirty @kerrence 😂😂😂😂
@S_ParalysisGuy that has never not been unsaid of me...😉
@BooRadleyFreak @assbuttOG @WWEGraves after the same was done to me actually...but hey I’m still here...U decide...I rather pity young Forrest here...He “Ahabed” it a bit...
@RomulusJohnston @assbuttOG @muhmentions ...he’s just a bored chode from Kentucky who instead of focusing on his job in the mail room,who got hoisted on his own petard...classic case...&amp;I suspect those sacks of undelivered mail in his basement “office” are by now rather sticky🤭
@pnutfinger @D2_Derpinator @ameliacubs12 @SUBWAY yes U do young man!...Now U’re in trouble!!😂...give her my best as clearly she puts up w/alot...
@CalypsoBeach @MaraWilson somebody find me some doughnuts!!😂
@Neukoln19 U make alot of demands usually made by a cornered weapon brandishing villain holding a hostage w/no where to go but over the ledge...put the kurling stone down son...&amp;let the baker go...👨‍🍳🥌👮‍♂️👮‍♀️👮‍♀️👮‍♀️👮‍♀️👮‍♀️.....😂
@Neukoln19 never been mugged on twitter before...interesting concept...🤔
@ReganRoars ☺️
@holliswebb I hope that helps...&amp;thanx!!☺️
@holliswebb -allow some things to come easy (especially the diatonic “non button” kind)...but it can become annoying when the musicality isn’t absolutely persued...It’s doesn’t need to be about technical proficiancy as much as musicality...just look at Niel Young...He rocks! :)
@holliswebb I strongly recommend: Howard Levy,Jason Ricci,Lee Oskar,Charlie Musslewhite,Little Walter,&amp; on chromatic harps(the kind w/the button),Stevie Wonder&amp; Toots Thielmans...There are many great players,but alot of bad ones creating a low expectation...the harmonica will-
@lvanProvorov wait til U hear the record...We did something really good...☺️
@Mr_Pibb19 @assbuttOG 😉
@boner_saint 🙄😴
@nottheothermark @assbuttOG that constitutes a threat...☝️😉
@LauraHallMusic I’d say classic,but they are very similar...
@cleopatrascat @DeanBlues @fredflunk @chizzckh I shall find out...&amp;get back shortly
@cleopatrascat @DeanBlues @fredflunk @chizzckh yes I do...&amp;it’s really raging back&amp;forth&amp; rather off the rails right now it’s two strong polka tenors singing “that’ll be the day” in different keys&amp;tempos...&amp;languages from each other...usually knocks of by 6pm these days...🙄 ☺️
@DeanBlues @cleopatrascat @fredflunk @chizzckh I will confere&amp;ask if we can tell U offially the lng awaited title of our 2018 soon to be classic: “            😉🤭🤫🙊🙈🙅🏼‍♀️✋🏿☝️🤡🤐🤢                                    🔥💀😈💀🔥                  “
@DeanBlues @cleopatrascat @fredflunk @chizzckh ha that’s not the title that was inner monologue I chose to shre to express the tumoil of secret keeping&amp;concensus... 😂
@Neukoln19 or was food less important to the baby?...
@Neukoln19 but earlier U said U needed $200...was the baby less imprtant to U then or did U just now do the math correctly?...
@cleopatrascat @fredflunk @chizzckh for the first time I really could...🤔
@waynejacker what for?
@cleopatrascat @fredflunk @chizzckh yes!! At last yes we have a title!! :)

@quesara5 @Music__Mentor Thank U Sara!! ☺️I feel so lucky to’ve written it...it’ll always make me proud...
@Queen050780 @Breakbreadlines @KrangTNelson @davidslavick can I call U out on Ur ignorance?...Does that make me Ur pal?...😂😂😂😂
@Queen050780 @Breakbreadlines @KrangTNelson @davidslavick well for one thing,he seemed2be looking for trouble🤪...not that I mind,but that can get rather old especially4those who read what I post😬 And2ndly,I wonder about Ur definition of “friendship”...sadly I sense otherwise😉
@Breakbreadlines @Queen050780 @KrangTNelson @davidslavick U guys are a bit late to this one...🤔
@Breakbreadlines @Queen050780 @KrangTNelson @davidslavick I find it pretty funny myself...😂
@jollygoat @KrangTNelson I would suggest twitter is where U may find out that everyone is...😂
@Queen050780 @Breakbreadlines @KrangTNelson @davidslavick If I felt that way,I’d never say anything...I just enjoy making new friends on twitter...the blocking seems to make U so happy...😂
@Harrs21 @assbuttOG U sound hungry...but at the same time,U also sound like U’re off solid foods...take care of Ur jaw kids...don’t be that kind of inmate🤔#onetogrowon
@StrikingYak @assbuttOG certainly not sweating the “satire” from the “humorists” under the bridge tonite...😂😂😂😂😂
@Reubnick Hey,don’t worry about it&amp;I appreciate the kind words...&amp;I’m sure someday U will atone...🤔
@Reubnick @assbuttOG I see only agreement&amp;concern...always nice to tweet w/tweeters...on twitter I mean...so sad U see argument...😂😂😉
@Music__Mentor by that I meant on top of strongly laid out lyrics,I got to write&amp;arrange string parts....to the extent I could☺️

@assbuttOG Ha well another opportunity missed...so much U’ve strived to achieve has been such a disappointment for U...god U are like the Willy Loman of twitter😂...At least we both got to see the fate of that bot U had proclaimed would go on 4ever...but hey things’ll turn around

@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab To sleep perchance to dream...I'm passing out...cheers✊️😎
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab Ha!! Hopefully we won't notice...
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab We can't all be William S. of course but it's the gig
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab And right or wrong,it got him laid...Bless the bards!!
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab A rather romantic notion that said fire will even last forever... ;)
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab Oh I hope we do...takes the pressure off of us.. :)
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab But that is my desire for symetry talking...I think U're just right...
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab maybe that's a trend...which accounts for the incoherency...&amp;so we evolve none the less...
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab I agree...that's why I never fully trusted the man or listened fully to my teachers...
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab I do believe our communication skills may improve&amp;thusly allow our political thought to evolve🤞
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab :)
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab ..compromise for consensus,there'll always be a trade,unless U all ARE figments of my imagination
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab I think as soon as U put "political" next to "freedom",U in some way automatically compromise
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab That is the very real&amp;apparent problem...as demonstrated at the highest levels this week
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab at least that's how I'm reading great uncle Karl...
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab Exactly&amp;that understanding constitutes at some point,the end of tolerence..it's hard work freedom
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab There would have to be an abandonment of said tolerence like any other system to avoid parodox
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab Only following that tolerence of intolerence beyond the point of reason,only way it made sense2me
@bdshorizons55 was that today!? Please send a picture of that&amp;I'll retweet the crap out of it!!
@eantonygray @daryo @John_Westra @getongab I would suggest that his point was in any dogmatic though taken to it's ultimate extreme...

@Reuters @ReutersTV This is different from political opportunism!! Here&amp;now as a centrist moderate I must finally agree:THIS IS NOT NORMAL!!
@Reuters @ReutersTV Is ourPOTUS actually equivocating hate group protestors w/hate groups!?Or confederate generals w/18th century founders!?

@ChaVonZee16 ...the middle...where people meet...✊️
@ChaVonZee16 I'm just offering a thought is all...☺️
@ChaVonZee16 &amp;it advances....nothing...just saying
@ChaVonZee16 That is in conflict w/what U just said...
@ChaVonZee16 as am I&amp;I wonder if U truly want "no republicans" at all in 2018 like U say in Ur tag...Do U mean that? Really?
@ChaVonZee16 -clamp down on states like we BOTH live in...it's a danger&amp;declaring war on those who disagree w/U is no way to last..😉
@ChaVonZee16 again, that's cool...but if that's all U are rating as well enough,that might not last...still federal laws that are there2-
@ChaVonZee16 Sounds like it's all worked out Ur way then...I guess anger is lucrative where U live?
@ChaVonZee16 ...but hey enjoy Ur pristine bike paths&amp;gated communities...I am glad U "feel" represented in Ur little neck of the woods...
@ChaVonZee16 -pseudo superiority of which U are boasting...It only serves to augment a divide that keeps eggyolks like him in power🙄
@ChaVonZee16 if that's Ur only goal U won't get very far...the orange baby tantrum is but one man&amp;symptomatic of exactly the complacent-
@ChaVonZee16 ...niether was the best cogniac if U go back🤔
@ChaVonZee16 ...&amp;besides the best blunts were never legal...😎
@ChaVonZee16 who can't!?...U sound as oppiated as all the masses...as long as U get Urs I guess...very decent🙄
