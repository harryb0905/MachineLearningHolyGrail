@Deligracy thank u. i just wanna make it good :,)❤️❤️
@ClairesConfused @w0kehan if it was a tv show we would have a crew of 100 people and 6 months to edit it.
@SuperfruityPhan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
just a reminder that both parts are:  an hour and 45 min each.  made by 2 guys.  uploaded for free.  and i probably won’t post for another couple months so i’m more than happy to take extra time to make it great. the amount rude tweets i’m getting is insane. 😳
So me and andrew had a random burst of inspiration last night and we wanna add some stuff to part 2. I don’t want to rush it so part 2 is gonna go up Monday the 11th! it’s gonna be another movie length video so it’s been pretty time consuming to edit haha but i’m excited!🤗🔺🔺
@jamieebakerr @vap6rwave @pessimisticcatt @AndrewSiwicki but i def don’t want anyone triggered! 😳🙏🏻
@jamieebakerr @vap6rwave @pessimisticcatt @AndrewSiwicki the issue is it’s all triggering. conspiracies in themselves are triggering. so maybe i should change the viewer discretion to a trigger warning? or maybe just have it say both? it’s hard for me to judge what’s triggering cause i feel like it’s different for different people
@SpankieV this was so great ! and made my day!! :,))) and thank u :,))))) ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!! HAHAHAHA @SpankieV  (full vid - https://t.co/FBJLmCKh56) https://t.co/lmD3t0Qi3M
@AllyHaughey OMG!
@pessimisticcatt @AndrewSiwicki i always start with a viewer discretion :) but part 2 is more fun and more.... emotional? haha

@PhillyD @YouTube it’s hard cause i knew that it wasn’t gonna be brand friendly at all and i totally understand my stuff getting demonetized sometimes. but i do feel like more advertisers should get on board w/ edgier stuff. if youtube wants a netflix demo i think it needs edgy content too.

@jamescharles @TrevorMoran oh, i’ll have good juicy questions for a sister squad q+a too. just let me know when.👨🏻‍💻
@TrevorMoran what’s the most expensive music video you and ricky have made? what happened to andrew graham? is he still managing everyone individually or did he pick and choose? how much was ya’lls rent?
@TrevorMoran who controlled the adsense?  is sam still married? did u have a group text without connor? what happened to ricky’s ordinary live performance (brought to u by pepsi)? how much did u pay charlie puth for the theme song? honest review of the documentary?

feel cute might get back into my house later. just kidding still evacuated and the city said “sorry we literally don’t know what’s going on either lol” when i called 🤗🤯 https://t.co/UMvpwrzSMF
interesting. it’s definitely been confusing for me to understand. i just don’t get how all these youtubers could just not get paid for a months worth of their work. my brain doesn’t comprehend it. makes me terrified of all youtube networks honestly. like, whose next? 😬 https://t.co/EydBacdfvD
we were told by people at Defy that the bank was in control of the money and that they make the decisions now.  but now we are hearing conflicting things. it’s been a mess and there’s no one to even contact anymore and so many people fucked over😓just trying to do my best to help https://t.co/T0aTGNuXHp
thank you! good to know! Hope @defymedia can help figure this all out. so many people are in the dark with their money stolen. so awful. https://t.co/KOkMn1RztD
Very well said. @Ally is the bank that Defy put their money in and they have the power to make things right for all the creators who were screwed over by Defy. It would be amazing if they showed support and fixed this. 🙏🏻❤️ https://t.co/Oc2WLvpNMD

I know i haven’t posted in a while and i should be working on a new series right now but it’s hard to think of an idea with everything that’s going on. i just feel kinda numb 😓 hope u guys understand
@Dr_JMink @JulieALeach @cruzwriter @CityofCalabasas i heard a rumor that it had something to do with massive looting and they wanted to block off the roads so they could have more control over it. but i also heard there were hot spots and they thought they could flare up in the middle of the night. just rumors tho.
@VCscanner thank you for keeping all of us updated. i’m so grateful 🙏🏻
@YourIllusionSP thank u. :,) it’s hard for me to get excited because of everything going on right now but it is really cool. ❤️

@Banks one channel who had money taken got 421 million views that month. i can’t even imagine how much money was stolen from them. it makes me fucking sick
@KatieDonoghue9 Ryland along with many other youtubers were with the Defy youtube network and haven’t received their ad revenue checks from last month. Rumor is that defy may have used that money to pay their debt.
deleted my tweet because i don’t trust any of those people and i don’t know what they are capable of. but don’t worry, i’m gonna fight for my friends and boyfriend who we’re screwed over last week with all my heart. 👊🏻❤️

Which would you prefer for the final episode/ the jake interview?
So.... the last part  is currently 2 hours. we’re having trouble cutting things out because it’s all so interesting and real. i don’t know what to do. i also feel weird about adding music to some of the things me and jake talk about. 😩

@swaindiana @jakepaul thank you for being so open minded and not looking down on me. this story was great! i agree that i have so much to learn but i’m excited to keep learning! ❤️
@gustavonever according to jake*  i don’t speak for anyone. i am showing his thought process and what he wants to say is his truth. i’m not the Fbi. as far as i’m concerned all these children are messy or have been messy in the past. my goal was to explore his mind. and we do that. 👍🏻

@WhatsTrending @jakepaul @LoganPaul Vlogger........ 😓
(2/2) understand why people are upset but i think it’s important to see it from all sides. are sociopaths gross? no. does it feel gross when u think about a sociopath acting out one of the symptoms? depends on who you are. but once again, i shouldn’t have made it scary 1000% 🙏🏻 https://t.co/ihT4GmuiUA
i’ve suffered from bulimia, body dysmorphia and depression for the last 15 years. i would 100% consider the feeling i have when talking about those things to be “creepy” “gross” and “icky”. it’s not me that’s icky. it’s the feeling i get when describing them. i totally (1/2) https://t.co/DvaxvRxrf6
Kati is my friend and i wanted our conversation to be relaxed and real. we both got comfortable and didn’t think everything through. but i think the music and b roll just enhanced everything which was 100% my fault. she didn’t know i was gonna do that. 🙏🏻❤️ https://t.co/S08Kz1WxR3

taking a break from twitter for a while. ill let u guys know when the videos go up and when they are planned to go up. but besides that i’m stepping away and i’m gonna focus on making them. part 4 on wed and part 5 fri. ❤️
@mikeboydvideo @SsjDeath it’s offensive
@sharingscars @FoldyHolds @contrashelby .’m dealing with hate from so many people for so many reasons. can we save the political stuff for like... a month from now? haha
@idolizingomez i didnt accuse anyone of anything. i observed. and yes, your childhood creates who you grow up to be. good or bad. me included.
@mikeboydvideo $10 an hour editor remark was shitty. im fine with criticism but that comment was just shitty. to me and to the editors out there who are vastly underpaid and treated like shit that didn't sit well with me.
@mikeboydvideo i apologized, changed things, added a disclaimer and apology to episode 3 and have done everything in my power to make people feel heard. im so tired. i dont know what else to do.
@JohnPodzinski thanks man :))
@mikeboydvideo from looking at your pics it looks like you edit your own stuff too and know how hard it is to make something. i think its pretty shitty for you to make fun of it knowing how much working editing a video takes.
@rossirvin11 @jakepaul who the fuck said i was perfect?
@katiet121 @jamiewordsleyx no worries!! i never said my opinion on trump when i was with kathy. i kept that whole video very non political because i’m not into politics. but no worries! 🤗❤️
@katiet121 @jamiewordsleyx i don’t mean to sound rude but when have i ever talked about my political views? haha
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 https://t.co/WAJZhPO0gw
@EltonCastee ⛰⛰⛰⛰⛰⛰⛰hahhaa thanks man. i get it. and i don’t wanna hold u back from opinions. just wanted u to know that i went into this with good intentions and being nice toward the family was important to me. and hard to balance
@petermonn ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
@EltonCastee ya. it’s been a true rollercoaster of emotions this week for me haha
@EltonCastee @french_fry_23 u didn’t watch the whole video. clearly. come on man. i said i wasn’t gonna judge them until i met them or knew more about them from jake
@RBlackCoyote i think maybe i just connected to it because as a youtube who is constantly being used for views the idea of a parent doing it hits me in a weird emotional place. but i very much said that she’s not a bad person and that later we see more of her story.
@RBlackCoyote they..... post..... videos....... of....... them.....hating on each other.....for public consumption....... i feel like it’s important to show that. it says so much about jake and why he is who he is..... which was the point of the series. and a turning point for me personally
@EltonCastee i was literally villainized for part 2. so the fact that you thought part 2 was better just makes me even more confused about what the fuck i’m doing haha i just never know what people are gonna be mad at me for :/
YOU WARNED ME. THEY ALL WARNED ME. HELPPPPP https://t.co/Nw8JVUkrGi
@neilcain1234 but thats....the.....point.... hahahaha but i understand! thanks for watching the first 3! &lt;3
@neilcain1234 wait what? that’s the point. that’s it’s NOT ok. i’m confused ...
@EltonCastee @french_fry_23 that’s not trueeeeeee 😩
@EltonCastee them posting hours of videos doing innapproptriate things and talking about each other PUBLICLY is something i’m allowed to react to. nerdcity can do it but i can’t? i literally said i’m not gonna judge them until i meet them 3 times &amp; i was NICE about them 😩😓
MY HEART 😭❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/F0yuhA8XPD
if i had a dollar for every text i’ve gotten from one of jake pauls victims, enemies, or friends begging me to not mention them in the series i think i’d enough to buy my own Team 10.
:,) thank u ❤️ https://t.co/XHBgb63zKc
ya. i debated not posting it because i thought people would think it was dragged out but it was a really important video to me. it was the day i started questioning everything too :/ https://t.co/QtO3fkPnJM

@KEEMSTAR @jakepaul holy shit hahahaha 😂😂 it’s been a wild ride!!
i’m not gonna try and make anyone like anyone. my goal was and still is seeing why jake is the way he is. and we did that. TRUST ME. haha k back to editing! see u guys tomorrow! i’m nervous! 😭😬😬😬😬😬 https://t.co/FmdMAibDxM
thank u for trusting me. i’m really really excited about this series and where it’s gonna go. i’m excited to be on this ride with you :,) matching face tattoos after? KIDDING.... kinda 🙌🏻👊🏻🕳 https://t.co/wFF6faI6O4

@NetNobody @rahafumatar @ilovemusic5685 i was told by a professional that the 2 words were the same. i should have been more careful about it and i apologize in tomorrow’s video. i was just trying to make something cool. i wasn’t trying to make people upset. but i’m trying all i can to fix things :(
@myendlesslou @NetNobody i know. it is what it is. i know my intentions are good and i know i’m gonna get shit no matter what. but i’m proud of it and i’m excited for people to see where it all goes. ❤️
@NetNobody it was something me and him both talked about and he was aware the whole time, which i’m addressing. for me it’s more of a study of why he is the way he is. the sociopath element was added because it can explain a lot and open up the conversation
Part 3 Tomorrow.  An eye opening and very strange twist in events but I’m really excited by how in depth and genuinely controversial the subject matter is getting. Not everything is easy to explain and sometimes you just have to dive deeper. 🕳🕳🕳 https://t.co/sERuQoWnWQ
As I edit I realize no matter what I do a big group of people are going to be pissed at me. Either people who hate jake, people who love jake, the mental health community, sociopaths or scariest of all.... the Paul family. Happy Sunday!! https://t.co/Vxm7KNFoMY

@lexforchange @Aly_Sheehy the reality of the disorder in perspective. i blurred the footage but it still is obvious what it is. i’m sorry if it hurt u to see it in my video. only love coming from my end i promise :( ❤️
@lexforchange @Aly_Sheehy i’m so sorry. i used footage of something that was unquestionably the most awful and heartbreaking news story i could from recent events to show the level at which someone with the disorder doesn’t have empathy. i only used the news footage because it i thought it would put (1/2)

Part 3, 4, &amp; 5 on Mon/Tue/Wed refilming some stuff today to address the concerns of part 2. But i think it’s a good thing  &amp; going to make the conversation better &amp; less dramatized. Jake will be in part 5! i know it feels like i’m milking it but trust me, it was necessary. 🙏🏻🧠 https://t.co/gOcSh1aQk8
I wanna address some of the issues people had with episode 2 and i’m figuring out how to do that today. in the meantime this was a great and eye opening video for me. check it out ❤️ https://t.co/XCZFeUgNSB

@LoganPaul a surprise extended finale?! 👁👁🤯 https://t.co/Nc5kKpSW70
@LeighBryan @jakepaul @AndrewSiwicki @KatiMorton interesting! i liked this episode better too. so i was shocked that some people were mad about it. but i’m so fascinated by sociopaths.
@moschicko how would you explain it?
@rachelstarlive @itshayleybop @ZacharyJRose @jessesaintjohn then you aren’t a sociopath. because sociopaths don’t care about their safety. at all. they have a disregard for themselves and others. it’s the main characteristic
i understand why people are upset. i definetly went overboard with the horror movie editing but that’s cause i got excited &amp; love editing horror. but i’m going to be more sensitive with the editing going forward. the last thing i want it to hurt anyone. :(its never my intention. https://t.co/aNcXkJo5eI
@rachelstarlive @ZacharyJRose @jessesaintjohn wait, are you an actual sociopath? cause i didn’t see that tweet. i don’t think you are right? because anhedonia is very very different.
@rachelstarlive @jessesaintjohn rachel!! hi!i definetly didn’t insinuate that having a mental disorder makes you toxic. but being an actual sociopath by definition is someone who would not be great to be in a relationship with. but i would NEVER insinuate that a mental disorder in itself would make anyone toxic
super interesting video. i watched it when i was researching for the series. https://t.co/pDUM7MbXEt
@jessesaintjohn @RickyPDillon they are a couple so it’s only fair to include her
@jessesaintjohn @RickyPDillon don’t forget bella
@jessesaintjohn @RickyPDillon i genuinely think people are just having fun on twitter. i don’t think it’s that deep. i mean, i used clips of tana mongeau. it ain’t that deep. haha but i also do think people should be more aware. even if it’s just them joking...at least they won’t be so easy to manipulate 😬
@jessesaintjohn because at the end of the day sociopaths are real and almost every single movie talks about them and there’s tons of articles online about it. all i did was put it on my channel and talk about something i’m interested in because i’ve been so hurt by them in the past.
@jessesaintjohn in a world where we have a shooting daily and we have sexual assault all over it feels like telling people to be more vigilant isn’t a bad thing. even if it causes a few people to freak out and say “is my friend a sociopath?!” on twitter and forget 2 hours later. seems worth it.
@molls @jakefogelnest thanks guys!!!!! :,))))
@jessesaintjohn why is it bad to help the average person spot the signs just to be aware. not to diagnose. but to at least be aware. i wish i knew about it sooner.
@jessesaintjohn teaching people how to spot the obvious signs is helping them get away from a toxic relationship and could even save them from having children with someone who doesn’t actually care about them. or anyone
@jessesaintjohn people with severe antisocial personality disorders don’t have empathy and don’t care. at all. so for anyone to be offended is so confusing to me considering they actually literally don’t care. like. at all. and its something that is rarely even discussed and it can affect lives.
@willdarbyshire thanks man!!!!
@tanamongeau HAHAHAHAHSHSIAVWJSGWUVD
@petercoffin ❤️❤️
i tried to make it clear in the vid, the description, my twitter, &amp; all other places that people can’t diagnose each other &amp;that a therapist needs to meet them. and also that it’s not the obvious awkward kid it’s someone you would never expect. people who fly under the radar 👍🏻 https://t.co/8i5dABGql8
@vajayjaysrock thank u!!!!! :')))
@kayceeook @tanamongeau HAHAHHAHAHA i love my daughter!
interesting. im very curious to hear more from people diagnosed with ASPD. help me fall down more holes! tell me more! https://t.co/nbeSe8wOBo
@MrBombPop @tarajoarcher @harto @KatiMorton sociopaths dont get "help". and if they do its RARE and only to keep them from hurting people. it has nothing to do with them dealing with their emotions cause they dont care. thats the point. i read 2 books about it and its very interesting.
for even more info and a more in depth look check out @KatiMorton’s video she posted today! https://t.co/VRbhuxO9oM

they are very very similar and are both apart of anti social personality disorder. psychopaths are born that way, sociopaths are triggered by trauma. i’m not a therapist but i’m pretty sure that’s case. it’s very fascinating though. https://t.co/T0w4ZtgUqH

we are still editing and we even have some more last minute additions to film 😬🤯 it’s been a real rollercoaster haha https://t.co/yQWrQAh2WD
usually i post back to back but then i get sad when it’s over. i like the idea of spreading them out a little. since theres 8 parts i was thinking maybe 2 a week? they’re all around 40-50 min so that’s still a lot to watch. would it be more fun to make the series last longer?😬👁 https://t.co/sIrJzJW3CL

PLOT TWIST. the butt doctor said it wasn’t a hemorrhoid and that it was actually a fissure I got from an aggressive bowel movement. I cant wait to turn 30 this week! 🤗 https://t.co/AR55l4GKTt
An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. https://t.co/wkmLBcq87e

@EllieJayden hi!! i didn’t see ur other video and i didn’t mean to make it seem like any kind of attack. i just thought your title and thumbnail was funny and it popped up in my feed. it was just so perfect with your text in the thumb next to ur title haha i didn’t mean any harm! ❤️
@Jack_Septic_Eye watching your video about “taking a break” and i loved it so much. it’s so good to see another youtuber talking about that cause i feel the same way. you are such a sweet caring guy and i loved this video. k that’s it bye 🙃

@Domdollaazzz @petermonn this wasn’t meant to be shade. i don’t know history and backstory of literally everything. i think she’s funny and i occasionally watch her videos when they pop up. not everything is drama or shade. haha

@JakeHyslop_ @mtaylor8488 @mizozein @snazzist @JeffreeStar btw jeffrees not making what he should either, in case that wasnt clear. he makes his money from his makeup line, but youtube ads are awful for him too. its frustrating for both of us :(
@JakeHyslop_ @mtaylor8488 @mizozein @snazzist @JeffreeStar it’s not about rich or poor. it’s about making what we deserve for the work we are putting in and the views that it’s getting. imagine your coworkers all making 10x what ur making for 10 years. wouldn’t that make you crazy? haha

@jcry_ptids @MelRod93 @petermonn she’s my friend and i’m not the police. i never said i was. i said i would try my best. also he had an entire video (part 2) to tell his side. the end of part 3 was her turn to do the same.
@MelRod93 @petermonn i disagree. i’m so incredibly proud of what i made in less than a week and with zero budget or support from a network or company. i know i can’t please them all but at least i pleased myself and i’m really proud of what we made.

@ImmaBrett ps. maybe one day @YouTube will just change the name from “trending” to “stuff my mom would Dvr”
@ImmaBrett HOLY SHIT HAHAHAHA

@grav3yardgirl :,))))))
@wheezywaiter thank u :,) i tried really hard to balance it.
i’m not denying that at all. once again, i was an observer in all this. i think both people are guilty for their own reasons. but i don’t think him or her are evil people and i would feel weird if i didn’t make that clear ya know? https://t.co/dcKr5D32Ih
i spoke to her about that clip before i put it in. she says she was just kidding around and meant more like waiting to get into a concert &amp; building anticipation. which makes sense. she would never purposely want people waiting for hours. i don’t think anyone would want that. :( https://t.co/vMtGEqIiIf

@tubefilter :,))))) ❤️❤️❤️
stayed up all night with andrew to make part 1 crazy! it feels like a conspiracy video 🤗😍🌀🌀🌀🌀 see u in 5.5 hours!!!
this was really therapeutic for me to make and i got all the answers and didn’t hold back. it’s not a “redemption” video for tana. it’s for the people who were fucked over and want to know why it happened. i’m also really excited about trying something investigative on my channel https://t.co/LgIu1PBJOV
The Truth About Tanacon in 3 Parts. Starting Tomorrow. https://t.co/miE6z3hfD2
@glennylennox @tanamongeau this is possibly the most infuriating tweet i’ve ever read. nobody has lost more sleep over this shit than me. i’m using this as a way to deal with it emotionally (through making something) and to give people answers and closure.
The series me and Jeffree start is possibly going to be a 5 parter so it’s going to be a big project! But i promise when it comes out (most likely mid july) it’s gonna be worth the wait!! https://t.co/KBQF1QYJGf

The Truth About Tanacon 3 Part Mini Doc Starting Thursday https://t.co/ll99r8QR7x
update: we filmed all day and it was some of the craziest and most real stuff we’ve ever filmed. we are gonna cut down the 7 hours of footage to 3 parts with no music and no sound effects because I don’t want it to feel fake at all. i feel really good about it. what a journey. https://t.co/s6bXsS1o3i
oh... if anyone is gonna keep it real in regards to this insane situation it’s me. i’m so invested it’s insane. probably too invested at this point haha https://t.co/1bV3s6dW6z
i just am really passionate about it and i find it more fascinating than any conspiracy i’ve talked about this year. https://t.co/s6bXsS1o3i
i want to do a video about tanacon. i want to talk about everything, interview people involved, talk about the conspiracies, interview tana and really deep dive into this. i know i have a 2 parter planned to post this week but would it be ok if i focused on making this instead?
@JeffreeStar @billboard I’d have to say Jeffree Stars ASMR side channel that’s hopefully in the works 😍

@lnternetainment @mach0menos i thought Good Times was legit and that it would work. i don’t know shit about conventions. why would i? my book signings get planned a month in advance and i’ve never had any issues so i expected the same
@AlexGrim @_morganadams_ the amount of things i’ve done the last 48 hours that i will never tell anyone is insane. don’t speak on what you don’t know man.
@tanamongeau @jamescharles i’m kinda sad i wasn’t documenting this experience but it would have been a 10 part series and would have taken me 2 years to edit.
I’m very proud of you for offering this. As messed up as everything got i think we all knew your heart was in the right place. https://t.co/7CZ4WUdNZ6
@kathygriffin @TeresaYaw :')))
Nobody should have to email anybody to get a refund. Please do that legwork yourselves &amp; refund every single person that spent money on this event. Also send a personalized signed picture of Tana so they have something special at least. No more press releases. just make it right. https://t.co/KBaf0VhuCe
i tried organizing my own meet up in anaheim today but it’s not possible and would turn into another safety issue and anaheim won’t allow it and will shut it down. i’m so sorry this happened and i promise i’m gonna do my best to make it up to u guys. https://t.co/MNr0MUnKLn
something special when i do my next book tour. i usually go to all the major cities so i will have a special private free meet up with those tanacon ticket holders and make sure they all get something special and have an amazing time. https://t.co/oiUjdmpPS3
i’m working on getting the list of people that rsvpd for my meet up and for those people i will hold a free meet and greet/live show in the LA area this year. for those who are in other parts of the country that have their tanacon receipts i will make sure you guys get (1/2)
yes they will. if they don’t refund i will do it myself. https://t.co/BRQnnIuCES
they are refunding tickets but as for what i can do, i don’t know yet. but i’m gonna figure something out. ill keep you posted. im getting on the phone now with people who might be able to help. https://t.co/sMa43KqHRh
i don’t blame tana but i do have some serious questions for the people that organized the event. overselling tickets, not having enough water, and letting people burn? not okay. and even though it’s not my event i promise i’ll make it up to you. i’m so sorry. https://t.co/Mk3EabeYBY
Just found out Tanacon has been cancelled. I’m so sorry to anyone that came out here to see me. It wasn’t my event and if it was it would have been run differently. i’m heart broken looking at the videos of people waiting all day in the sun getting burnt.
i wasn’t involved in the planning of the con so i have no idea what their plan is next but i do know that if u came to see me i will do my best to make it up to you somehow. i promise. and i know tana just wants you happy as well. it’s been a hard day for everyone involved. :( https://t.co/Kh5YEzVTYm
I think Tanacon had good intentions and i think tana’s big heart was in the right place but i guess a convention just can’t be thrown in a month. it’s not realistic. I genuinely support @tanamongeau for trying something like this but at this point i don’t think it’s safe. (1/2)

this wasn’t a hidden agenda of mine but that is an interesting idea! what’s the lowest i could charge? a dollar? can i charge 25 cents? i do love the idea of completely uncensored and not having to worry about getting flagged 🤔🤔🤔 https://t.co/90ec38AcVK
😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/2QorrYqZ6h
obviously the longer version wouldnt have music or fancy editing. im editing a conversation right now for my next series and i love it so much and i have to cut it down from 40 min to 10 min and i hate to throw so much away. https://t.co/XKMqi6iDsK
QUESTION: whenever I have a conversation with someone in one of my videos (bunny, my brother, trish, etc) I usually cut it down from an hour to like 15 minutes. would you guys want to me upload the longer versions somewhere too?
There might be a surprise 2 parter up this week... 👀👀👀👀👀
@CassidyOsborne1 @tanamongeau @GoodTimesShow because that’s how conventions work. it would be literally impossible for a youtuber to meet every single person who came. also 65 bucks to see a concert, panels, and have 2 days of fun? complaining about that is ridiculous
A PERFECT FATHERS DAY! https://t.co/2SAt6I6TKy

when i was 19 me &amp; my family were fired for making a video at work &amp; it was devastating. that was back when youtube was new and confused companies. but now in 2018 i hope you guys realize that she helped give 7 million viewers a look at how personable your employees are.❤️ https://t.co/UV0FSozUS6
Dear @ultabeauty, one of your incredible employees Carol gave my sister a makeover at your store for a series I posted on youtube. it was free promo for your company and the reception was great. Please don’t be a company that fires employees because of youtube. please reconsider. https://t.co/QksJEhYL0m
THIS IS GREAT! I AM HERE FOR GRAV3YARDGIRL 2.0!!!!!! https://t.co/nTRGh3HUT5
@KEEMSTAR i feel like this is all planned and it’s gonna be part of a documentary about the dangers and darkness of social media fame. fuck. i’m mad i didn’t think about doing it first. 😬
WATCH US LAUGH AND CRY! 🤗 https://t.co/OEiCaB7TmQ
@putaviolet @TeenChoiceFOX i think they know the jig is up. i think it would be really cool to see them put the power in the teens this time. could be kind of inspirational in a weird way
i wonder if @TeenChoiceFOX will change it so that your votes will actually choose the winners this year? i feel like it’s time. that’s not even meant to be shady, i just genuinely think it would be cool to see them do that. but i’m also too old to be caring about this haha
@LourisPotato @KaryLipa @RuPaul that would be a dream! one day! 🙏🏻❤️
@KaryLipa @RuPaul i was asked! but i didn’t do it because of my body issues 😔

i remember @Ryland_Adams being so scared to start a channel and being so nervous to leave his current situation he was in. and i’m so fucking proud of him for taking a risk and for believing in himself as much as i believed in him. love u so much dog dad :,) https://t.co/tH7WQuJHBE
the next 3 parts come out this week and then a week later there will be 1 more. i can honestly say we've never worked harder on something and im so proud of it. it different than anything ive ever done and im excited for u guys to see a new side of me and of all of us. :')
what i REALLY want is for @thebobbyburns to do an old school critical video ABOUT the sunday show. that would be EVERYTHING 🍿🍿🍿 https://t.co/IgHaQMLPwt
2/2 but i think everything happens for a reason and i’m really happy that it all did. i’m genuinely excited to see bobby make more videos on his channel. that’s what i wanted in the first place as a fan of his stuff. anyways, there’s no drama or tea. i’m too old for it haha
posted the full story on my Snapchat but the shortened version is: i didn’t fire @thebobbyburns &amp; there’s literally zero drama. like, none. haha we both just weren’t completely loving the sunday show so we put it on pause. it’s not easy admitting when something doesn’t work. 1/2
@tanamongeau momma don’t lie https://t.co/eEPblt8wb7
its not technically a scary video. but it’s not technically not a scary video. but maybe it’s not not a scary video and actually a not scary video technically? find out this week 😈 https://t.co/4vqwIqsnpz

@pugIover she’s been asked daily since she was a child. i’ve witnessed it. she thought it would be cool to address and be very funny and casual about it since she doesn’t care anymore about people thinking she’s gay. i love the video and i stand by it 100%
@pugIover hi, i was beat up and put in the hospital for holding hands with a man in public. i’m sorry if i’m not offended by a vlog title. everyone needs to grow up and see how fucked up the world ACTUALLY is.
@savannahseymour hahaha 😂😂😂❤️
THIS! morgan’s reality is that she’s been asked if she was gay her entire life on a daily basis. her making a video about it and doing it so light heartedly is why i love her so much. i hope one day i have a child just like her. i would be a very happy guy. https://t.co/qGieXAoLcn
I found her video powerful because of that. when she said “no” so not offended and casually and then turned  the camera off it gave me faith in her generation. i wish it was like that when i was her age. https://t.co/1OH8jXHWeQ
there are REAL issues to talk about &amp; REAL homophobia in the world &amp; this is not it. as a victim of actual physical assault due to my sexuality it’s hard for me to be triggered by a vlog title. focus on actual issues instead a girl who jokes about people thinking she’s a lesbian https://t.co/QVSHJbOXst
JUST A NOTE: morgan making a video about people assuming she’s a lesbian and questioning why while talking about it in depth with her GAY brother and his BI boyfriend is nothing to be triggered by. if anything she’s spreading light on the ridiculousness of stereotypes. (1/2)

I 100% support this! but i’m scared it will make the kids sitting ducks for potential shooters. maybe they walk out of class but stay inside the school? maybe in the quad? https://t.co/P0uwqTzQMG
i’m not super political and i’m not a “left” or “right” person but i support the school walkout because if i was a student i’d be fuckin pissed. 18 school shootings so far THIS YEAR. that’s insane. something needs to happen. not sure what, but something.

as awful as yesterday was it reminded me how grateful i am to have so much support. i’ve never felt that kind of love before in my entire life. thank you to everyone who saw through the bullshit and who recognized how much i’ve changed over the years. i owe you so much. ❤️
@Hannah0405 @TwitterMoments @Twitter yes. 100%. and twitter is just adding on to it.
@that1chick11 @TwitterMoments because @Twitter and @TwitterMoments care more about clicks than the truth. they are letting my name be connected to pedophila for their own benefit. it’s disgusting.
current moods https://t.co/QOpZKAA5ab
@TwitterMoments can u please take down the moment about me? it was a false accusation and is proven to be false. having my name next to the word pedophila is causing me so much emotional distress. it’s just not right.
@karaswisher i love that. thank u for this. honestly. ❤️
@karaswisher the jokes are old and were out of context. i’ve been molested in my childhood. i dealt with it by making jokes. and i’ve grown up and stopped doing that. people just don’t want to let me move on. this whole experience was insane and awful and i don’t wish it on anyone.
@Twitter @TwitterSupport @TwitterVideo i see you changed the title. but can u please be balanced and not have all the tweets in the first half be negative? the truth is that i’m not a pedophile. why not have that come first in the “moment”? this is a big deal. my name is in the same sentence as “pedophile”. not cool. https://t.co/P8HAmLW2cp

@AnOpenSecret and this bump in the road isn’t gonna stop me. even though that’s what they want. love u guys!
@JarridWilson of course! i deleted tons of videos over the years. every day i try to be better. but i appreciate you being willing to accept the apology 😌❤️
@JarridWilson ❤️❤️❤️
@JarridWilson yes i did. and countless other tasteless jokes that i’ve apologized for and completely grown and changed myself and my content over the years. and i’m so glad i did. Jesus forgives, so shouldn’t people too?
@FBE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i genuinely think someone was trying to make a conspiracy theory about me in real time. uploading clues, hints, etc. i don’t believe logan’s people had anything to do with it. it seems almost scripted. it’s all very fascinating. gotta love the internet! https://t.co/4deWoZm0ib
@MannyMua733 ❤️❤️❤️
@JeffreeStar :,) love u ❤️
@dean_gaga @cutiegagaloo this means the world to me. thank u
i was so proud and excited about the video i posted today and i didn’t even get to enjoy it. it was ruined by a troll who wanted to make me look bad. well fuck that. i’m starting today OVER! i LOVE my new video and it’s my favorite thing on my channel to date. 🙌🏻❤️ https://t.co/X7UK2lCE3v
@hankgreen @KaidenIF ya. it’s actually insane. and makes me fear being a creator on the internet even more than i already did :(
@Twitter @TwitterSupport @TwitterVideo hey guys, can u please remove the twitter moment connecting my name to pedophila. it’s been proven false and it’s disgusting. thank you. https://t.co/fLSNhDOcDy
@IISuperwomanII :,)❤️
Also, the channel that “exposed” me also has videos on their channel like this. proving even more so how hypocritical and disgusting they are. https://t.co/amBw3tPDKl
OF COURSE. so now the channel that made that awful video is claiming that someone in hollywood “made them make a slander video about shane dawson” to get revenge on me for talking about pedophiles in hollywood. i can’t make this shit up. https://t.co/CsfwatiCF8
really @Twitter? how about shining light on ACTUAL PEDOPHILES instead of jokes taken out of context from years ago that were edited and manipulated? i fucking can’t with this shit. i’m leaving the internet for the day. https://t.co/hQQJIXxG73
@buckhollywood :,) love u so much
@debanjalibose93 because it’s not an apology. people said i’m a “pedophile” and i’m NOT. it’s me clearing my name. please watch my video for more clarification before posting rude tweets
it’s interesting that the more i speak out about things the more people try to “expose” me. makes me wonder whose behind the “exposing”? 🧐 https://t.co/JuXQjdTri5
@oranicuhh this means a lot. seriously. thank you.
I grew up. I changed my content. I apologized countless times for my shitty offensive jokes. instead of dragging me down people should use me as an example of a creator who can CHANGE and better themselves and their content. i’m so proud of who i am today.
i’m not a pedophile. i can’t believe i even have to say that. it literally feels like i’m in a nightmare. https://t.co/i0mo11xNg3
Meeting My Daughter 🎵❤️ https://t.co/PNuPJmo0F1 https://t.co/enbZsqCTnC
@MrMoeOthman no. that video is all jokes taken out of context and has all the punchlines removed. it also is illegal to claim someone is a pedofile and use 6 year old jokes as “proof”.
@magiskemanfred @SophiePecora thank u! i’m trying so hard :,)

@PreciousSarei @Garrett_Watts @Ryland_Adams 😍😍😍
@JARRETT i thought the music video was incredibly well done and a step up from most music videos being put out in terms of production value. stylistically it was great. way better than most internet star music videos. i appreciate the effort.
@MySubBoxIsFull she's 14. i don't think we can call someone a horrible person until they are at least 18. so much developing and learning happens in those years.
side note, not enough people are talking about how genuinely good some of bhad bhabies music videos have been lately. that new one with her chewing gum on the hood of a speeding car was fucking incredible. I WANT TO BE HER. https://t.co/npnGZMTvF7

@RileyBloom16 @isabellabaraja5 @gsimmons_15 @thebobbyburns watch bobbys interview with me on his channel 👍🏻
@liIdepressed @shanessdemons @thebobbyburns no worries. i love bobby so i understand his fans sticking up for him. but all my intentions were to help promote a youtuber i believe in :)
@shanessdemons @thebobbyburns @liIdepressed i didn't mean to sound rude. i'm multitasking so my replies are short. but it was a great experience for me and bobby and nothing was a power play
@liIdepressed @thebobbyburns then u misread the situation
it's so crazy, i went into it thinking it would just be a fun series to do about a "hater" and i came out of it with a few new friends for life. what a christmas miracle! 😍☃️❤️

@soft_spice i don't really remember what i said that would make u think that but honestly, i think everyone should be who they wanna be and not give a fuck what anyone thinks! 👯
@moonysuns it's so so touchy. it was really hard to not bring up that theory. i didn't myself but it was brought up by someone else. it's all so dark and fascinating. humans are so fascinating.
Tomorrow's video is extremely intense and i tried as hard as I could to be sensitive to the victim. the mystery of why my classmate killed someone is something i really wanted to explore. and i learned a lot. you never really know anyone i guess.

My Review: It makes me wanna scream sing in my car. It makes me want to do a fake concert in my living room while Rylands upstairs sleeping. It makes me FEEL something. And that's VERY rare. It also has one of the best choruses in pop music and is better than Out Loud. FIGHT ME. https://t.co/w8BSdR2roi

@JonathanElm5 @tyleroakley @CanineGuts sometimes gay people ARE garbage. and so are bi people, cis people, trans people, poc, white people, etc. literally all people have garbage in their communities. but luckily there's so many good people out there that make up for it. ❤️
like i've said before, the more "anti gay" someone is the more closeted they most likely are. they feel guilty because of their religion so they constantly talk about how evil it is to be gay. it is actually really sad :( https://t.co/pizNIDicvp
