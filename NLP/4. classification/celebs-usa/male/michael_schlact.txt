@PitchingNinja @FlatgroundBats People in professional baseball shouldn‚Äôt forget the power of one action, one word, or one gesture. People look up to professional baseball players &amp; coaches as heroes. This is awesome, @ABREG_1. Baseball wants more fans? Follow this lead.
Being out-performed is understandable.  Being out-worked is not.  It takes ZERO talent to work hard. The time is now to cut the excuses &amp; get to work. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs easier to say you gave it your all &amp; simply lost rather than you didn‚Äôt prepare well enough.
@B_Horn22 Quite a crew right there.
@coach_tj5 I would skip over it. Don‚Äôt @ me.

This is absolute üî• from @TimTebow. Listen! https://t.co/LB4YY4YeOg
So you have talent? So do many others. What separates you is how you handle failure, how you respect &amp; listen to coaches, whether or not you show up teammates when things go wrong, &amp; whether or not you respect the uniform.  Talent doesn‚Äôt always set you apart but character does.
Reminder:  Success ON the field is directly related to your work OFF the field.  If you don‚Äôt want to put the work in when the lights are off you‚Äôll never be able to sustain success while they‚Äôre on.
Doing something without a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is nothing more than wasted movement and wasted time.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how insignificant it may seem. Giving it a purpose drives you &amp; keeps you engaged + motivated to the finish, not just until it gets tough.
@berndtcakes @FMRedHawks Thanks so much

So many young athletes say they want to be the best, yet when you watch how they act, how they prioritize things, and most importantly how they practice, it rarely shows.   You want to be the best?  Take care of yourself, prepare, &amp; practice better than the rest.
@lee_gale9 @FMRedHawks Thanks Lee. Appreciate your care getting us where we needed to be safely &amp; back to my family. Can‚Äôt go unnoticed.

The stats are stacked against you making it, there‚Äôs no doubt about it.  However, chase it with a ‚Äúwatch me make it‚Äù mindset rather than a ‚Äúwill I make it mindset.‚Äù   Stop asking why &amp; start asking why not.
Really proud of you, @lefty_TA. Couldn‚Äôt be happier for you for what you‚Äôve accomplished. Blessed to have played a small part in your journey. https://t.co/ZU7MxOiKNO
Baseball is won and lost by the simplest parts of the game like catching, throwing, baserunning, &amp; strikes.   We want to complain when it‚Äôs time to practice them.  We don‚Äôt take it seriously because we think we‚Äôre too good for them.  Winners do the little things right every time.
Pitchers are athletes too.  https://t.co/wLkIBG0RAz
Today is a new day. Yesterday may have been rough, didn‚Äôt go the way you‚Äôd hoped, or been full of setbacks.  That‚Äôs ok.   Wake up today knowing that adversity isn‚Äôt meant to be a roadblock, but a speed bump. It‚Äôs not meant to be a dead end, but a detour. Stay positive.
Unify your team and individualize your players.   One team, many individuals.   One goal, many roles.   One purpose, many ways to achieve it.
Success right now is a result of the hard work (or lack of) from before. Rarely are there instant success stories.   Those who are successful have built a foundation of hard work, determination, perseverance, &amp; smarts.   You can‚Äôt go at 50% and expect to get 100% return.

We learn more about ourselves through adversity than we do through success.  Though it‚Äôs no fun at the time, hold on.   In the end, you‚Äôll become better if you let adversity teach you rather than defeat you.
@PitchingNinja The ole left handed slider from the right handed pitcher.
If everything was easy &amp; we coasted through, we‚Äôd never learn perseverance, grit, or how to properly handle adversity.   There‚Äôs a reason for everything. Even though struggles aren‚Äôt fun, they‚Äôre necessary for true growth.  In the long run, we‚Äôre better for going through them.

When recruiters, coaches, scouts, etc are watching you, remember that talent on the field is important.   However, how you carry yourself off the field, how you wear your uniform, treat your teammates, parents, coaches, etc is important too.   Don‚Äôt neglect those things. Ever.
There are countless learning styles, upbringings, temperaments, body styles, attitudes, &amp; personalities.  Why, then, would we coach everyone the same way?  If we truly want to get the most out of our team then we owe it to ourselves and our athletes to individualize our teaching.
@lokationnation Set attainable goals that allow them to reach it and succeed repeatedly. From there, up the ante. Telling them they can is one thing. Showing them they can is another. Them feeling it is when the next level is taken.
Every single player on a roster is important.   Championship teams don‚Äôt get caught up too much in status or roles.   They simply prepare &amp; are ready whenever they‚Äôre called upon in whatever role the coach sees fit.   Work hard, be ready, play hard.

Surround yourself with people who:  ‚Ä¢believe in you ‚Ä¢are truthful with you ‚Ä¢want success for you ‚Ä¢bring the best out of you  Who you hang with says lots about what you stand for, what you believe, &amp; where you‚Äôre going. If you want to change your trajectory change your circle.
@CaptHook37 @FlatgroundApp This is my favorite one yet.
One thing that‚Äôs commonly mistaken throughout life is the opportunity to learn from ... not be defined by ... failure.   Everyone fails. You‚Äôre not exempt.  The difference comes when you realize that failure is something that happens to you, it‚Äôs not a description of you.
Leaders rise because of qualities that are selfless &amp; giving.   Many sit there once they‚Äôve reached the position &amp; then only worry about themselves &amp; abandon whatever got them there.   Leadership is selfless, giving, and sacrificial.  The higher you go the more you should serve.
The best coaches understand that while they may be developing good players, they‚Äôre really developing great people. A game is temporary.  Your athlete will go into the world &amp; impact many. They‚Äôll become parents, teachers, &amp; leaders. Your influence on them can impact generations.

A championship team doesn‚Äôt always have the most talented players, but it does have the most resilient &amp; gritty players.  When tough times come (and they will), those who are equipped to handle it &amp; walk through it positively will always succeed.
Taking a family picture with a 3 year old and a 9 month old is something like successfully herding scared cats.
You may not know it all. However, we all have perspective. Pitching coaches can talk hitting, from a pitcher perspective. Hitting coaches can talk pitching, from a hitter perspective.  Educate yourself, figure out your perspective, &amp; help players get better.
Rare traits in today's athletes that coaches admire:  -Hustle -Grit -Mental toughness -Selflessness -Positively handling adversity -Competitiveness -Coachability -Team first above all else

You won‚Äôt win the big games without mastering the little things.  Championships are won as a result of the work that‚Äôs put in when the stadium lights are off and nobody‚Äôs watching.  Start now, work hard, win later.
COACHES:  ‚Ä¢ Reminding the player how they succeeded in the past rather than how they failed in the past is much more effective. Build them up.
Being a good teammate &amp; a good leader looks something like this.  https://t.co/pJpHKKFrZd
If you want to lead, do so by example. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you say, it‚Äôs what you do.   Words will carry zero weight if the actions don‚Äôt validate them.
Losing, believe it or not, can be the best thing to happen. Without it we‚Äôll never learn the necessary discipline, determination, &amp; drive needed to ultimately win.  Temporary disappointment to a loss is fine. Dwelling in it &amp; letting it define you is not.  Be fueled by adversity.
This is fantastic.  https://t.co/mTuHg9TnFM
Failure must happen. It‚Äôs critical to the success story. Without it, one will never know how to handle adversity WHEN ... NOT IF ... adversity strikes.  Those who succeed understand failure‚Äôs role &amp; used it to rebound &amp; reload.  We either succeed or succumb. The choice is ours.

Those who don‚Äôt understand the process of success will mock you &amp; make fun of you in your failure.  Those who understand the process of success will cheer you on &amp; push you forward in your failure.  You. Will. Fail.  The key is failing forward &amp; having the right folks around you.
@billiejauss So good!!
@KeithTVGuy @FMRedHawks Hahaha!! You got it.
When a smart coach teaches your child something &amp; you go home to re-teach the way YOU think it should be done:   1. You‚Äôre teaching the child to disregard those in a leadership role.  2. You‚Äôre not allowing the child to learn independence &amp; how to learn by potentially failing.
Coaches are always watching.   Practice with intent. Play with passion. Perform with confidence.
@KeithGrunewald @jamesramsey23 Congrats!!
It‚Äôs no secret that social media is huge these days.  That being said, be smart.  Don‚Äôt undo years of hard work because you don‚Äôt think before hitting send.

If you aren‚Äôt teaching &amp; training people to win AND lose with class, you‚Äôre doing them a disservice.   Losing with class &amp; accepting that there is much to be learned from it is a part of life.  Keep your nose down when you win &amp; keep your head up when you lose.
Teams are never truly teams until you replace the selfish with the selfless.

If you say, ‚Äúwhat do they know? they were just a minor league coach‚Äù when your favorite mlb team hires them to the big league staff, remember:  The players who are successful today in the big leagues were developed &amp; helped by those minor league coaches years before.
It takes one second to undo years of progress. Be smart.
How often do leaders look down on those they‚Äôre leading when they fail &amp; put on a performance of ‚ÄúI have never failed.‚Äù  This is the worst possible way to get the most out of them, because they‚Äôll begin striving for something they‚Äôll never achieve ... perfection.  Be vulnerable.
What you are going through or what you went through can be used to help others as they go through it now.  True inspiration isn‚Äôt about seeing someone who‚Äôs never failed or messed up. True inspiration is seeing someone who‚Äôs failed or messed up walk through it wisely &amp; overcome.
Self-evaluation is key to improving. Learn to be honest enough to tell yourself what you need to work on.  From there, put yourself in the company of those who will be truthful enough to call you out, push you forward, &amp; help you grow.  Develop a plan, learn from mistakes, &amp; go.
Build a culture that makes others want to be a part of it.  Place emphasis on character. Place emphasis on winning. Place emphasis on selflessness. Place emphasis on losing with class. Place emphasis on we&gt;me.  Leaders that don‚Äôt give direction end up with lots of lost followers.
Rarely does success come when there‚Äôs a lack of work ethic, a lack of character, and a lack of grit.  Work ethic produces good habits, character produces good choices, and grit produces good perseverance.
@RyanMaue What weather app (if any) do you recommend
Leadership is taking something complicated &amp; communicating it simply &amp; clearly.  Too often we lack the necessary simplification &amp; communication required to get the most out of those we lead.  Big words don‚Äôt make you smart. A true understanding of what you‚Äôre talking about does.
It‚Äôs not hard to encourage, and often it‚Äôs all someone needs to turn their day around.  Rather than consistently looking inward &amp; being blinded by what‚Äôs around us, let‚Äôs look outward to see how we can bless, encourage, &amp; lift others.  It‚Äôs what the world needs right now.
Your role on a team may start small, but big, important roles are always earned over time.  Consistency, integrity, reliability, &amp; productivity are key.  Someone at the top doesn‚Äôt just decide they want to be there. They start  at the bottom &amp; prove themselves time and again.
Check your mindset if you think practice is boring.  Regardless of what you do, practicing is refining your craft.  The best are never outworked &amp; find joy in the process of improvement.  If you don‚Äôt have the drive to practice, you won‚Äôt be driven to succeed.
So you want a platform? You have one. Want an audience? You have one.  You don‚Äôt need a big stage, thousands of followers, or a big title.  You need one person, in one place, and one message.  If you want to change the world, start with one person.
You may not feel like getting up, getting out, and getting better.  But ...   For every moment you wait, someone else is ready to work.  Not being talented enough is one thing, but being outworked?  Unacceptable.
@FlatgroundApp Much appreciated. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. Careers &amp; lives will be changed. Social media gets a bad name sometimes, but things like this show what it‚Äôs meant for.
Listen:  ‚Ä¢@FlatgroundApp is exactly what this era of recruiting is all about. Use technology &amp; social media to your advantage.  I manage the @FMRedHawks, a professional team, &amp; we‚Äôve used platforms like Twitter to sign players before.  Embrace it, use it, &amp; give thanks for it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been‚Äù just wont cut it. Sure, there‚Äôs safety there. But, complacency crushes creativity.  We live in a world where technology is increasing. With that, so should our understanding that ‚Äúwhy change it‚Äù could become ‚Äúwhy not change it‚Äù if it‚Äôs for the better.

We strive for physical health &amp; focus on strengthening that part of our game, yet we neglect the mental side.   The physical side is important, don‚Äôt get me wrong.   But, what good is any of it if when we step between the lines we crumble under pressure or can‚Äôt handle adversity?
Coaches, before you take on the role, put your playing days to rest.  The shoulda woulda mentality is toxic around young players.  Meet them where they are, don‚Äôt take them where you thought you should‚Äôve been.
Coaches:  ‚Ä¢ If you want to lead them, first you‚Äôve got to love them.  It‚Äôs common to hear ‚Äúcoach just doesn‚Äôt get me.‚Äù That‚Äôs a barrier to getting the most out of an athlete because if you don‚Äôt know them or what makes them tick you‚Äôll never know how to properly motivate them.

Coaches:  ‚Ä¢Lead from a ‚Äúwhat can I do for you‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúwhat can I get from you‚Äù mindset. Not only will you grow better people, but you‚Äôll grow better athletes too as they learn what it means to be accountable, proactive, &amp; selfless.
Players:  ‚Ä¢You can have the best tools, science, data, and coaching at your disposal, but if you haven‚Äôt developed your mental strength for competition none of it will matter. It‚Äôs not one-sided.
@EWErickson @DaveRamsey Yes. Life changing.
Pitchers:  ‚Ä¢ The foundation of all that you do is understanding your body, how it works, why it works the way it works, and what movements create rhythmic explosiveness &amp; which ones prevent it.  Start there.
@MarioDB @MLB It‚Äôs not exploiting, it‚Äôs willing participation. These people want a better life &amp; now are offered that. The previous way was trafficking, smuggling, rafts, ripped apart families, &amp; deaths at an attempt to chase a dream. MLB opening the door is preventing all this.

@EricStangel @cvspharmacy Hear ye hear ye I issue this decree....
Rarely does something less than ideal happen where we give thanks for what wasn‚Äôt because of what could be. Things happen for a reason. Maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre supposed to slow down, give thanks, &amp; be present.   Control what you can control.
We live in a time when everyone is trying to hide their mistakes &amp; mess ups. All the while, more people are hurting &amp; looking to connect with someone who can help than ever before.   Your past, your mistakes, &amp; your mess meets people where they are. Embrace it &amp; change the world.
@drivelinebases I love how the ‚Äústatus‚Äù stigma is being broken. It does not matter where you‚Äôve been or what you‚Äôve done. If you know baseball &amp; are educated with the direction baseball is going &amp; able to adapt, you can be hired.
Coach, your way isn‚Äôt the only way. If you have a cookie cutter mentality, you‚Äôre missing it. All of it.  Each athlete learns, interprets, and applies differently. Besides that, each athlete has different body composition, physical limitations, &amp; abilities.  Individuality.
@drivelinebases Nutt finished the year 95-97 with an absolute hammer. He was devastating. Really proud of him &amp; I believe this is his time. Following @brandonmmann‚Äôs footsteps. Indy to the show.
A lack of work ethic doesn‚Äôt always become exposed immediately. It does, however, always become exposed.  Put in the work now to reap the results later.  Coaches like talented players but they love hard working players.
This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. Thank you for this, @desiringGod. https://t.co/TpRd07mxtV
Happy 12th anniversary to the love of my life. I‚Äôm so thankful to be with someone who loves me unconditionally, supports me unwaveringly, &amp; will be there for me no matter what. The joy of my life has been being your husband &amp; building a family with you. Love you! https://t.co/MW4TykDz3i

Champions lose just like everyone else.  Champions fail forward, though.  Losing teaches, instructs, and disciplines.  The difference between a champion &amp; everyone else is how they handle the adversity thrown their way.
Can you imagine if your true love sent you the gifts from the 12 Days Of Christmas song 12 days in a row? Talk about anxiety.
Be nice to those around you on your way up. Why?  1. You don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôll be in a few years. Don‚Äôt burn a bridge you may need. 2. Just because they‚Äôre ‚Äúbelow you‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt be ‚Äúabove you‚Äù soon.  You may need them on your way back down.

Our thoughts are able to be ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù if you really think about it. So many emotions come in &amp; go out every few minutes that we can easily become overwhelmed. Let‚Äôs learn to filter &amp; fix those thoughts on what is true &amp; right. It could be a game changer for us all. https://t.co/tkremmwxBs
It should never be beyond us to look beyond us. There are people everywhere who need guidance, love, grace, and direction.   If we‚Äôre always focused on ourselves we‚Äôll never be able to focus on others.
We can learn so much more from a loss than we can from winning. While it's painful, it's also educational if our mindset is right.
Wanting to accomplish something great starts with a why.   Heading towards a dream or a goal without a why is like driving a car with a blindfold on.  Sure, you‚Äôre headed somewhere. But, the chances of reaching your destination are very, very slim.
We can say all we want &amp; want what we say, but until we live out what we say &amp; prove ourselves to be legit we will never truly lead them.

The best thing you can do for your team is to be a leader.  Leaders don‚Äôt always have to be the outspoken one.  Leading can be by example many times in the way you work, live, and interact with others.  Most of the time, people look to leaders during tough times, so be ready.
It‚Äôs like I blinked &amp; I‚Äôm 33 years old today with an amazing wife &amp; the two best boys in the world. Couldn‚Äôt be more thankful.  Each year I learn something about myself. Getting older isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs a blessing to be alive. Can‚Äôt wait to share what I‚Äôve learned with my boys.
@BenjBowman Thanks bud
Today is a new day.  Yesterday is over. If there were mistakes, setbacks, or failures, learn from them &amp; move on more wisely.  If there were successes, steps forward, or positives, embrace them &amp; move on more wisely.  Keep your head up when you fail &amp; your nose down when you win.
Thank you, @frankienbennys! Bring back family time! Hope others follow suit. https://t.co/gLtBCYhDcf
When you know God, everything you do comes FROM acceptance not FOR acceptance.

Scouts &amp; evaluators are always watching. Remember, it‚Äôs not always about how well you do when they see you. Sometimes, seeing an athlete ‚Äúfail forward‚Äù is exactly what was needed.  If your teammate makes a mistake, don‚Äôt show them up. Pick them up.  If you make a mistake, learn.
@JarridWilson I‚Äôve never felt more helpless than when both boys are miserably sick at the same time. Hold on tight it‚Äôll be okay before you know it.
Why would you expect to excel in games when you won‚Äôt put in the effort during practice?  The person that says practice is a waste of time is the person that‚Äôll never reach their true potential.
So you want to be successful?   PRACTICE with a PURPOSE. PREPARE with a PLAN. PLAY with a PASSION.

@coachballgame Makes sense. Never seen it.
We feel like we can‚Äôt help others if we‚Äôve failed in some way.  The best way to help others is to be relatable.  No one wants to be looked down on while they‚Äôre down, they want to be looked in the eye while you lift them up.  Your failures allow you to meet people where they are.
@ABCA1945 A5: before you can develop the person you have to know the person. Knowing the person allows you to know what makes them tick, what motivates them, and what they‚Äôre passionate about.   Besides that they have to know that you love them before they‚Äôll let you lead them.   #ABCAchat
@ABCA1945 We don‚Äôt use too much technology but we do have access to spray charts and old fashion pitcher charts. They don‚Äôt lie!! The key is being able to communicate those to the players and let them understand what‚Äôs important from them.  Don‚Äôt have to spend thousands to teach. #abcachat
@ABCA1945 A2 (cont) We don‚Äôt let an opportunity pass to coach them up, whether in game, after, or before. Letting the player know the minute something happens is key to both learning &amp; understanding we‚Äôre there for them &amp; care about their development. #ABCAchat
@ABCA1945 A2: pitcher/catcher meetings before every series &amp; stay on the defense in game with moves/tendencies. This helps them learn the opponent but also teaches them about what to look for when similar opponents are being played.  Early work is huge for individualized work. #ABCAchat

A wonderful example of knowing where your identity comes from. It, contrary to popular belief, is not found in a job, a title, a status, an income, or other people‚Äôs opinions. It‚Äôs freeing.
This is the best. Also, very true. https://t.co/DOa28O8o9U
@caphillips3 Yeah most likely. Still not the best look. Emotion is nice though.
@caphillips3 It‚Äôs happened. Honestly, all depends on how big the situation was. Definitely can be construed as tamper tantrum. The guy‚Äôs personality, the type of teammate he is, clubhouse guy, all go into account.   Overall I don‚Äôt like it &amp; we had a quick call to the pen after it happened.
@jesseknoll It‚Äôs more about instincts. Yes. Knock the ball down. But seeing the throw, understanding the footwork, timing, etc is the hard part.
#RedSox fans:  Regardless of the outcome of the game with Eovaldi on the mound, that was a selfless, gutty performance. Don‚Äôt lose sight of what he did for the team.  That was a pitching performance for the ages.  Kudos, Eovaldi.   #WorldSeries
@JonAcuff You could‚Äôve read all of them between the start and finish of game 3 last night!

Beautiful summation from @JeffPassan about #WorldSeries game 3. Wow I love this game. https://t.co/U7fBVnpdE8
I‚Äôll be fixing breakfast in a few hours explaining to my 7 month old that daddy is sleepy because of #WorldSeries baseball &amp; how the importance of good footwork when throwing to bases cannot be overstated.
Who wants coffee? #WorldSeries

It doesn‚Äôt matter if baseball is boring to you or not, this is awesome either way. (Baseball is not boring) https://t.co/I3bDbg7nVg
More athletes than you know get positivity &amp; learn life lessons from you and NOBODY else.   Don‚Äôt just show up expecting to teach on-field skills and go home.   Be ready to transform lives.   Coaches have an amazing opportunity to reach &amp; teach more people than anyone else.
If you‚Äôre human you have limitations.   The great ones aren‚Äôt defined by what they cannot do, but by what they have done.  Limitations are speed bumps, not road blocks.   Changing that mindset changes everything.
Most people think the defining moments of their lives are the positive ones. They‚Äôre great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but the moments that will stand out in the end of having the greatest impact are those moments where we had to exhibit grit, perseverance, determination, &amp; positivity.
Dirt ball reads are critical. The extra 90 ft can be the difference between a W or L.  Don‚Äôt run the bases blindly. Know &amp; understand the situation, read &amp; react when a ball is in the dirt, &amp; know the arm of the catcher.   Sitting back &amp; waiting isn‚Äôt the answer. Make it happen.
Mistakes are amplified in the #postseason.  It‚Äôs why every detail is covered over &amp; over again when everything isn‚Äôt on the line.  Repetition of fundamentals isn‚Äôt because athletes don‚Äôt know how to do it, it‚Äôs because athletes need it to be second nature when it counts the most.
@KevinGausman Wait til kids. Then you‚Äôre practically diving at the remote.
@illuminaubrey_ üî• love this
Athletes should want to go play somewhere that gives them the best opportunity to grow as people, as athletes, &amp; somewhere they‚Äôll actually play.  Don‚Äôt just chase your favorite logo, your parents alma mater, where your friends go, or even a D1 school.  You‚Äôll regret it forever.
Mistakes follow you around for a while, but you‚Äôre not defined by them.   Nobody is perfect. Nobody can do it all. Nobody is safe from failure.  Your story can impact many ... not while you‚Äôre down ... but when you rise up again.   Don‚Äôt give up, don‚Äôt lose heart, and don‚Äôt quit.
Kershaw was at Fenway ... by himself ... preparing for the #WorldSeries.   You can teach skills but you can‚Äôt teach this.   If you want to be the best you have to do things differently than the rest.   https://t.co/GAqSEtoDsJ

Psst. Did anyone notice how @Cody_Bellinger running hard down the line extended the inning? That allowed @YasielPuig to hit &amp; could‚Äôve changed the trajectory of the entire season.   He ran hard on a ground ball to 2B.   Never underestimate the power of running hard.   #postseason
I was blessed to play for @csubero in the minor leagues with the @rangers. The @brewers are incredibly fortunate to have a coach who cares more about who you are as a person than who you are as a player. Los knows that relationships come before results.   Go @brewers! #postseason
It‚Äôs not what you make, what they call you, or what it looks like.   It‚Äôs who you impact &amp; how you impact them.  Everyone has a platform. Each one has a different size, but that doesn‚Äôt matter.   Whether it‚Äôs 1 or 1,000,000 ... be a positive, uplifting, &amp; selfless leader to them.

Why do we so often think that reaching a certain title or status automatically gives us a free pass from doing the little things?  Remember what got you to where you are now.   It wasn‚Äôt an entitled attitude, I guarantee you that.   Clean something. Carry something. Help someone.
The world we live in says, do more, get more, have more, &amp; be more.  This is causing more stress, anxiety, &amp; depression than ever before.  How about:   Do what you love, get what you need, have what‚Äôs necessary, &amp; be who you were created to be.
Spent some time with the family in the mountains today. Literally a breath of fresh air. Love time with them! https://t.co/tyxT8uCOBv
It‚Äôs not about who you were or even who you are.   It‚Äôs about who you‚Äôre becoming.   Every day and every adversity you face is a chance to grow stronger and wiser.   Don‚Äôt run from it. Embrace it &amp; allow it to propel you forward.
@Decker6 @SavedByTheMax That‚Äôs awesome!!!
You won‚Äôt be remembered by what you accomplished but by who you impacted.
Coaches try so hard to have the most knowledge, the most wins, and the most rings that they end up forgetting about the most important thing there is.   The athlete.   Never value status or achievements over the impact you can have on a person. Wins fade. Impact is generational.
Being successful has a little to do with you, and a lot to do with who you put around you.  Make sure the right people are on your team and in your corner.  Be lifted up by the right people rather than sunk down by the wrong ones or the lie that ‚Äúgoing it alone‚Äù is the best way.

Leadership comes in many different forms and on many different scales. You don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúfamous‚Äù or have lots of ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù to lead.  Stay at home parents can lead.  A coach of a little league team can lead.  Anyone can lead.   How many you lead is irrelevant. Start with 1.
Coaches try so hard to have all the answers &amp; be in the cutting edge of all the newest things &amp; be the one to win all the games.   These things are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong.   But, often, those you‚Äôre leading need your positive presence more than anything else in their life.

October baseball means that guys like Tony Wolters and Scott Oberg are heroes.   It means marathon games &amp; intensity.   There‚Äôs nothing like #postseason baseball.   If that was any indication of what this is going to be like, then we‚Äôre all in for a real treat.
A catcher‚Äôs receiving skills &amp; presentation dictates much of the success a pitcher has.  I get that a pitcher makes the pitch, but the catcher sells it.   There‚Äôs minimal difference between a strike and a ball anyways, so having a catcher who can present well is key.  #postseason
Freeland‚Äôs leg pause is something that seems insignificant but it‚Äôs actually very important.   Hitting is timing.   Leg lift pauses and holds disrupt that timing.   Find an edge, understand how each facet of the game works, &amp; practice whatever you can do to succeed.  #postseason

I don‚Äôt think we can look at this picture of Bob Gibson &amp; determine that all pitchers should have similar mechanics. Each athlete is individual and their bodies work individually.

The @fmredhawks season is in the books. I‚Äôve learned &amp; grown so much. Thankful for those who walked alongside me. @jillian_schlact is the rock of the whole operation.

A very very happy 34th birthday to @jillian_schlact! She‚Äôs the best. Simply put. She‚Äôs selfless, loving, caring, beautiful inside and out, &amp; I couldn‚Äôt be more blessed to be by her side. Happy birthday wifey!! You deserve all the best today &amp; every day! üéÇ https://t.co/g34I8wJM3D

Coaches don‚Äôt always recruit JUST the best athletes.   Who you are off the field matters just as much as what you do on it.  Don‚Äôt ever believe the lie that tells you that you‚Äôre invincible because you‚Äôre talented. There‚Äôs plenty more like you. Separate yourself from the pack.
@Redhawkfan4ever @FMRedHawks Thanks for the unwavering support. Sincerely appreciate you guys. #1 fans!
A sincere thank you to all @FMRedHawks fans. You mean more to us than you‚Äôll know &amp; your support is much appreciated. There‚Äôs no fan base in all of sports that cares like you do, and for that we‚Äôre all grateful.

@robgreene Guarantee it would dissuade it.
@robgreene I honestly don‚Äôt have a good answer. It is all filtered through a commissioner‚Äôs office, intent, situation, rules, player‚Äôs union, etc. Each case is always totally different. That was, IMO, a blatant attempt to hit Acu√±a.
It‚Äôs one thing to say you‚Äôre a leader &amp; another thing to be a leader.   Leaders aren‚Äôt always the loudest, often leading by example alone.   Leaders are consistent in all they do, including work ethic, decisions, &amp; selflessness.   Leaders walk in when everyone else walks out.

Time flies. Enjoy every single second and soak up every single moment with those you love.   When it‚Äôs all said and done, you‚Äôll cherish memories way more than money.  True joy doesn‚Äôt depend on a job, status, a bank account, or what others think of you.
@Brett_Phillips8 You guys hit beeps too early at home ... they wouldn‚Äôt open the gates to let me, @chriscoste27, and @atrenz10 in. Should‚Äôve told them ole 14 said it would be fiiiiiiine.

Surround yourself with people who make you better every single day. It makes all the difference in the world. Thankful for these guys. https://t.co/hl01vDvLD5
We forget that coaching is generational. Think about it: a player is going to wear your uniform, be a part of the team, and be in the organization for a few years at the most.   However, the impact we have on them lasts their entire lives and in some ways, beyond!
@TerryEvans24 @chriscauley @eastpoleATL @VeloCoffee @bluebottleroast Folgers, man. #BestPartOfWakingUp
There are wins &amp; losses. You will win &amp; you will lose.  However, losses can be learning experiences if you let them. Losing hurts. Losing is no fun. However, losing will let you learn things about yourself you may never otherwise learn.  The next time you lose, don‚Äôt pout. Learn.

Who you‚Äôre becoming is shaped by who you are when times are tough. We all want to be strong, confident, &amp; exude leadership qualities.   The truth is, without adversity, none of these qualities can truly be developed.   Don‚Äôt run from tough situations &amp; adversity, embrace them.
Really happy for one of our LHP Sebastian Kessay. His contract was purchased by the @Dbacks today. All of the @FMRedHawks family wishes you the very best! https://t.co/q7Ha7KNjwY

Love this advice from Jim Thome. When a Hall of Famer speaks about baseball, we should probably listen.  https://t.co/db85uXEaka
We will never achieve greatness without facing adversity.  Those who have achieved greatness learned that working through setbacks and failures &amp; learning from them rather than being defined by them made all the difference in the end.  Embrace the adversity &amp; learn the lesson.
@BenjBowman @RonPopeMusic @Newportfolkfest @ugafan618 He's going down to GA and I can't stop him. He knows where his roots are.
A very happy 38th wedding anniversary to my parents. My dad says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. I married my best friend. We‚Äôd rather hang out with each other than anyone else. We laugh together, we eat together, and we give thanks for our blessings together.‚Äù  Love you, mom &amp; dad
It may be easier to think about &amp; focus on all that's going wrong, but it's not productive or good for you.  Every day, think about &amp; focus on the blessings in your life &amp; all that you have to be thankful for ... no matter how big or small.  A positive mindset is a necessity.
In order to achieve greatness, of course you must dream big. However, dreaming big isn‚Äôt all you should do.  Those who achieve greatness don‚Äôt just sit around and dream about it happening. They get up, get to work, and make it happen.
I was blessed to have a small part in the journey of @caseymweathers and to get to know him on a personal level. Proud of you, Casey. https://t.co/smWNIVRfdx

We have a choice every day:   - to allow our fears and setbacks to define &amp; hinder us  or  - to use adversity as fuel to grow &amp; move ahead more wisely.
Who you were will be remembered much longer than what you did.
This. Is. Amazing.  https://t.co/vneuQOr21a
@adamweber Thanks so much. It was amazing meeting you. Thankful for you.

@RonPopeMusic @RonFunches What a moment. Forever changed the way I order (and follow directions).
When most people see road blocks, champions see walls to climb.   When most people see failures, champions see growth.   When most people see dead ends, champions see detours.  When most people see a loss, champions see a lesson.
6 runs in the 9th to win a game today. If you‚Äôve been around these guys any amount of time, that doesn‚Äôt surprise you. There‚Äôs no quit, no negativity, and no excuses.   Resiliency. Heart. Grit. Fight. Passion.   I love this team.  @FMRedHawks  @chriscoste27  @atrenz10
It‚Äôs not that those who are successful never lose.   Those who are successful learn from losses &amp; move ahead more wisely.  Everyone faces adversity. Those who achieve greatness are motivated by setbacks rather than defined by them.   Learn a lesson. Bounce back. Move on.
It‚Äôs amazing what can happen when you don‚Äôt give up. Most of the time, things aren‚Äôt completed or success isn‚Äôt attained because it takes too long or seems too tough.  Bear down, dig in, and persevere.
@chriscoste27 #GoodDayToHit #LookAtThoseFlags
Who you are and what you‚Äôre made of are defined when times are tough, not when everything is going your way.  Anyone can be positive &amp; work hard when things are easy. True success &amp; great character are built when you face adversity head on &amp; learn from it.
The best thing you‚Äôll see today.  https://t.co/s7B3mt5Auu
Happy 4th of July from some of your @FMRedHawks. https://t.co/VnaEbAl0br
Things won‚Äôt always go your way &amp; things won‚Äôt always work out. Those who achieve greatness are those who are fueled by adversity &amp; motivated by naysayers.   Don‚Äôt focus on the problem, figure out a solution.
Congrats to a great family! Proud of AJ! https://t.co/C9fbUufAL1
Rarely do we grow and rarely does our character truly develop when things are going well. We should absolutely enjoy those times. However, true growth happens when adversity strikes. It's a little about what happens to you and a lot about how you react to what happens to you.
How sad is this? https://t.co/mUqq7OFIb9

@ChristianL5 Love it!!!
My opinion on soccer:  Flopping should result in an automatic yellow. Then, the flopper should be removed from the game for 5 minutes to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù from his obviously traumatic experience.   A second flop? Gone for the game. Because, it appears they need serious medical treatment.
Being a leader doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve achieved a certain level of success, a certain title, or a certain lifestyle.  Being a leader means you walk in when others walk out &amp; you help those around you be their best.  Being a leader means giving up the right to put yourself first.
It's one thing to not allow a coach to scream at you. It's another to completely avoid accountability. If you miss a call, admit it and get better. Tough watching an ump avoid any questioning in a HUGE spot.
So NCAA umpires can call whatever they want and not "allow" coaches to even discuss it? C'mon. Ball 4 in a monster spot for @BeaverBaseball and umpire won't even let Pat Casey ask him about it?
A little rain makes all baseball players instantly become professional meteorologists.
It takes daily drive, dedication, and determination to become successful at something.  It‚Äôs never enough to hope for success, dream about success, or talk about success without ever actually working towards it.  Dream about it but then work for it.
I‚Äôm a very lucky guy. My wonderful wife blessed me with two amazing boys. This was the best Father‚Äôs Day yet! There‚Äôs nothing like running the bases after the game &amp; enjoying some family time! https://t.co/5pduHsLwdr
Congrats &amp; well deserved! An amazing family! https://t.co/om8UoZlZct
This umpire was so fired up to call strike 3 he punched the catcher in the back of the head. If you‚Äôre going to do it, do it 100%.  https://t.co/qLgTUuJWnO
Congratulations to @StPaulSaints manager George Tsamis on win # 1000. An amazing accomplishment. Tip of the cap to that milestone.
Leaders step up when everyone else wants to sit down.   You don‚Äôt have to be vocal.   You just have to be willing.   Lead with words. Lead by example. Lead with humbleness &amp; humility.   Step up. Step out. Step in.
Mistakes happen. That‚Äôs not what defines you. Nobody is perfect.  What matters is how you react, what you learn, &amp; how you proceed. Learn the lesson &amp; grow.

Best of luck to all those @MLBDraft hopefuls. 14 years ago my name was called by the @Rangers &amp; it changed my life forever.   However, if you don‚Äôt get drafted it doesn‚Äôt mean your dream is over. Keep fighting &amp; never give up. You never know.
The best thing we can do is fight til the very end. The truth is, we don‚Äôt know what the outcome will be. But, regret sets in whenever we fall short but wish we‚Äôd given more.  Give 100% every minute of every day. Those who achieve greatness never give in &amp; never give up.

A pathway to success is resiliency. Everyone will face adversity along the way.  It‚Äôs not necessarily what happens to you, but how you respond to what happens to you.  Winners recognize that failure and adversity are fuel to the fire, not an extinguisher.
We don‚Äôt necessarily improve when things are easy.   We improve the most when we face adversity head on &amp; take each moment as a lesson.   The strongest steel is forged in the hottest fire.
We‚Äôre headed home! Can‚Äôt wait to see the @FMRedHawks fans on Opening Night Friday at Newman Outdoor Field! https://t.co/V4rPRMeFjW

Our character isn‚Äôt revealed in times when everything is going our way. Anyone can exhibit confidence, positivity, faith, &amp; selflessness in those times.  Our character is revealed when times are tough. Who we are &amp; what we stand for become exposed quickly.  Who are you?
We won the game, which is good. But, Rafael Palmeiro did play against us at 53 years old and he hit a homer. https://t.co/RuIcAX6RFU
Losing is part of life. We simply cannot win at everything we do.  The key, however, is to take each loss as a lesson.   There is no such thing as winning and losing, only winning and learning.

If you‚Äôre going to go for it, you might as well give it all you‚Äôve got.   Most of the world does exactly what‚Äôs needed to just get by. In order to achieve greatness, you must go the extra mile.  It‚Äôs not always easy. It‚Äôs not always popular. It‚Äôs always worth it.
Last night was my first as manager without ‚Äúinterim‚Äù tag. Thankful to have the opportunity, but I‚Äôm more thankful for the support of those around me.

There is a big difference between being a coach and being a leader.  A coach will make an impact during the season. Then, everyone moves on.   A leader makes an impact during the season but also makes an impact that lasts a lifetime.  Coaches tell you how. Leaders walk with you.

To hear from someone who has just realized their dream of playing in the major leagues after 17 years in the minors &amp; indy ball that ‚Äúyou were a huge part of the process‚Äù makes what I do completely worth it.  When you coach, it‚Äôs not about you. Your idea of success should shift.

I would like to wish a very special Happy Mother‚Äôs Day to my beautiful wife. These two boys are so lucky to have a mama like her. She‚Äôs selfless, caring, loving, patient, &amp; fun.

Becoming a leader doesn‚Äôt mean you get to be selfish &amp; focus more on yourself &amp; your agenda.   Becoming a leader means you get to be selfless &amp; focus more on other people.   The best leaders are those who can humble themselves enough to serve others regardless of position/title.
Thankful for my position, my platform, and the opportunity. We have a great group of men here with lots of talent &amp; high character. Couldn't be more excited to start this journey with them. Go @FMRedHawks.   (photo: @dlemoal1) https://t.co/WRI0c4qEiZ

Success over the course of an entire season can be achieved by doing the little things right every single day.   Rarely do you have success or rarely do you fail based off what happened at the very end.  Daily drive &amp; determination mixed with commitment &amp; character determine it.
Thanks, @Twitter. I feel better &amp; can move on with my day knowing this. https://t.co/sCAoZTfjKb
Adversity is a dead end to the mentally weak.   Adversity is merely a detour to the mentally strong.  Don‚Äôt give in and don‚Äôt give up.
Strive to be the type of leader who lets everyone know that everyone is important, regardless of role or title.   Everyone, every day, plays a part in accomplishing something special.

It seems like forever when we're in the thick of it, but when we look back we realize it was over in a flash.   Enjoy &amp; embrace each second.
The biggest thief of confidence &amp; success is a doubting mindset. When you show up &amp; believe the opponent is better, you‚Äôre already losing regardless of what a scoreboard says.  Putting work in &amp; overcoming adversity helps us gain confidence. Gaining confidence keeps us competing.
This is one of the coolest things I‚Äôve ever seen. https://t.co/rp6tY4bDH9
That @JustinVerlander &amp; Bartolo duel was a wonderful reminder that there isn‚Äôt just one way to be successful as a pitcher.   The first pitch strikes &amp; command of the baseball was the same, but the velocity was completely different.   Embrace your strengths.

As a coach, I would take talented &amp; great people plus selfless attitudes over exceptional talent &amp; selfish attitudes any day of the week.
Big game players weren‚Äôt just handed that opportunity. They showed the coach that, in the little things, they could be trusted.  Over time that led to bigger opportunities. Wherever you are, work hard &amp; prove you can. From there, watch your platform increase.
I guarantee you whatever postgame interview you have isn‚Äôt as good as Cincinnati Bearcats Baseball.  https://t.co/FpPkqypafY
Championship caliber teams &amp; players know &amp; recognize that they are not defined by what doubters, critics, &amp; naysayers think about them.  Championship caliber teams &amp; players know &amp; recognize that they are defined by the work they put in, the way they act, &amp; their success.
Really happy for you, @tylerbeede. Big things ahead! https://t.co/cuNMy8uV4l
The easy thing to do when things don't go your way is complain about them. That's ordinary.  Those who achieve greatness take things that don't go their way &amp; use them as fuel.  Adversity becomes that which propels them closer to success because of mindset, perseverance, &amp; faith.
Disclaimer: I realize it‚Äôs 100 mph. Hang with me here.   This pitch works there, it works in the minors. It works in college, high school, and 9 year old little league baseball.  That location &amp; command of the fastball works from the bottom to the top. https://t.co/vMOKSZm4x5

Having a championship mindset means you‚Äôre humbled &amp; thankful for the success, but you‚Äôre motivated and fueled by the failures.  You aren‚Äôt defined by what you were, but by what you are becoming.  A championship mindset is rare, but there‚Äôs only one champion.
I love the way Adrian Beltre plays baseball. Passion, fun, fire, competitiveness, and love.   He recognizes what it takes to be a pro but never forgot what it was like to be a kid playing the game he loves.  #TexasRangers
The best know that the best way to win is to have confidence &amp; play relaxed.  Confidence comes from preparation. Preparation comes from doing little things right &amp; building a solid foundation long before the season starts.  Playing relaxed comes from knowing you did these things.

Nobody achieved success without failure.  Nobody achieved a comeback without a setback.  Nobody achieved greatness without inadequacy.  There is a lesson to be learned from tough times. Don't give up and don't give in.
Championship Traits  - Selflessness - Perseverance - Heart - Hustle - Grit - Excellence - Determination - Courage  Champions aren‚Äôt born, they‚Äôre made. It‚Äôs time to step up &amp; realize no one can do it for you. If you want to be the best, you must forge ahead and make it happen.

A championship team finds a way &amp; then makes a way even when there appears to be no way.  A championship team silences the voices of even the loudest critics by the way they work, act, &amp; play.  A championship team understands that it's not always how you start but how you finish.
@PitchingNinja @BauerOutage with the "I'm not mad, I'm disappointed" dad look.
When you step on the field, your mindset should be ‚ÄúI know I can‚Äù over ‚ÄúI hope I can.‚Äù Doubt stems from unpreparedness, a feeling of unworthiness, &amp; being scared to fail. Work hard, have a plan, know you‚Äôre on the team for a reason, embrace your role, &amp; remember nobody‚Äôs perfect.
I‚Äôm not quite sure what your excuse is, but please watch this catcher &amp; then never use it again. You can find a way if you really want to.  https://t.co/DjJdLppva9
Happy Easter! https://t.co/nWcfeDL0w6
I‚Äôve seen many succeed that others didn‚Äôt think would because of character, work ethic &amp; discipline.   I‚Äôve seen many fail that others  didn‚Äôt think would because of a lack of character, work ethic, &amp;  discipline.
You‚Äôll know you‚Äôre a part of a championship program when you leave every day better than when you got there.   Winners help those around them for the benefit of the whole team.  It‚Äôs not about the individual success. It‚Äôs about the collective success.
A championship team has a group of players who:  Feel like family. Fight for each other. Form an unshakeable bond. Fix their mistakes immediately. Flip negatives into positives. Fail with class &amp; learn from it. Forge through adversity.
Big games are won by everyone doing little things correctly and consistently.   These little things are introduced, worked on, and mastered in practice. However, most athletes hate working on little things in practice.  Remember, the simplest skills win ... or lose games.

Championship athletes recognize that winning on the field doesn‚Äôt just happen.   You must take care of business on the field, but you must take care of business off it too.  Eat right, sleep well, and always survey who you surround yourself with. It‚Äôs a collective effort.
@MarkArum @AshleyFrascaWSB @wsbtv @wsbradio I have a newborn .. so .. all of those, all night long. https://t.co/jcgqJjghN1
@pgammo Love this. Well done.
@AthleteTweetsO @RyKhoury Man I just wanted to shoot some hoops. My bad.
Coaches like talent, but what they really hope for in players is character.  Some of the most talented never make it due to a lack of work ethic, heart, hustle, &amp; grit.  Some of the less talented make it because of work ethic, heart, hustle, &amp; grit.  Control what you can control.

Putting on a uniform, being a part of a team, &amp; stepping onto a field are a privilege.   Too many athletes take these things for granted as if they‚Äôll just be handed the opportunity to do so again tomorrow. Untrue.  None of us know when our time is up. Give it all you‚Äôve got.
Part 2 of my @Sports_Spectrum season long diary of a professional baseball manager is now out! Hope you‚Äôll read it, share it, &amp; enjoy it!   @FMRedHawks   https://t.co/PCMnsDhmOO
If you love what you‚Äôre doing, you won‚Äôt call it a grind.  A grind implies something you‚Äôre forced to do that makes you miserable.  If you call the season a grind, maybe it‚Äôs time to find something else to do.  Thousands would trade places with you in an instant. Be thankful.
‚ÄúHi baby brother. You‚Äôre so cute and I love you sooo much already.‚Äù - Sawyer https://t.co/KR2k2r2Xkv
We‚Äôre hoping to get discharged soon from the hospital. Because of the tough flu season, our other son wasn‚Äôt allowed in to meet Sutton so we‚Äôre excited for the meeting &amp; the new stage of life we‚Äôre entering into. Thanks to everyone for the prayers &amp; well wishes. Means so much.
It's usually not the big home run that's the sole reason a team wins a game. Sure, it helps. What led to that point?   If you watch from inning 1 to inning 9, teams that win games:  -Make all the plays. -Don't give away free bases. -Throw strikes consistently. -Run bases well.
Let me just say this: you don‚Äôt know strength until you‚Äôve watched a woman give birth to a child. @jillian_schlact is stronger than I‚Äôll ever be. That‚Äôs a fact.
The best don't always think so highly of themselves that they can't see their faults.  The best understand that an honest self-evaluation of their faults is critical to improvement.  Perfection is impossible. Humility is necessary. Honesty is imperative. Improvement is essential.
Doesn‚Äôt get much better than this. Love my little dude. https://t.co/mkAnSrG9Ns
If you‚Äôre not getting playing time you want, don‚Äôt get bitter ... get better.  You still have opportunities to show your coach what you can do, because you still have a uniform to wear.  You still have practice. You still have off-field decisions. Teammate interactions.  C‚Äômon.
Thank you so much to Pastor @mikelinch and the rest of the @nsckennesaw family for sending these over! We can‚Äôt wait for y‚Äôall to meet him! https://t.co/VTi7TAs25n
A big thank you to the @FMRedHawks family for sending these flowers down here to Georgia. @jillian_schlact and I really appreciate it! See y‚Äôall soon! Sutton says he‚Äôs ready to get some AB‚Äôs! https://t.co/w0lph09zqK
The average person accepts no for an answer.  A winner isn‚Äôt satisfied.  The average person gives up when times get tough.  A winner finds a way through.  The average person is ok being ordinary.  A winner puts the extra in extraordinary.  Don‚Äôt settle for average. Be a winner.
Loving his first bath! https://t.co/1yMkcRuTjD
Thank y‚Äôall for the kind words. Means so much to us. @jillian_schlact is now surrounded by boys in the house, but she‚Äôs amazing. Blessed to stand alongside her and raise them together. Sawyer &amp; Sutton are two lucky boys to have a mama like her.
Welcome to the world, Sutton Dakota. 3/20/18 at 6:30 pm  Mama and Baby are doing wonderfully! https://t.co/ztSY0moM55
Want to know how to improve? Read below. The hardest thing to do is be so honest with yourself that you realize a critical self-evaluation is necessary. Lincecum could‚Äôve taken it in for the day. Instead, he sought out the guy who hit him hard &amp; used it as a chance to grow. https://t.co/uUYCjYXQj1
. @jillian_schlact‚Äôs pace of play is horrid. Maybe they should limit the nurse visits &amp; put a labor clock in the room. C‚Äômon honey.
. @jillian_schlact &amp; I have arrived at the hospital &amp; we‚Äôre excited to welcome our newest addition at some point in the near future. Prayers for the doctors, nurses, my wife, and our baby! Thank you!
I can solve this international mystery. It was one of my sliders that didn‚Äôt slide. You‚Äôre welcome. https://t.co/5CDPEunDO1
Wow! A must watch!  Athletes are afraid to fail. Athletes should be encouraged to take risks.   Screaming and yelling at them when they mess up is counterproductive. You yell, then wonder why you can‚Äôt get the most out of them later.   Watch this: https://t.co/NMpw7CJIUn
Somehow, athlete entitlement has made its way all the way to kids in elementary school.  Just because you play travel ball, you play in HS, or you think you‚Äôre the best on your team, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre exempt from the helping.  Rake, pull a tarp, etc.  It‚Äôs your team too.
Every minor league spring training game, various minor league guys have jobs. Radar gun, chart, foul balls, ball/bat boy.   You are not too good for these things. Think twice before the entitlement sets in that allows you to think otherwise.   If pros can, you can. https://t.co/T9G3QnIvx1
This is unbelievable.   Listen to this take on parents coaching from the stands, getting on to refs/umps, etc.   A must listen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your coach, go talk to your coach.‚Äù  https://t.co/ndHEbxXVkQ
You won't always like your coaches.   The worst thing you can do is complain about it.  The best thing you can do is deal with it.  In life, there's people in positions of leadership that you'll disagree with or won't get along with.  Winners learn to look past it &amp; keep working.
The toughest opponents we face aren‚Äôt always ones who are the most talented.  The toughest opponents we face are the ones who simply just won‚Äôt go away.  What can we learn from this?  Talent can take you there, but determination, fight, grit, heart, &amp; hustle will keep you there.
Excuses are for those who don‚Äôt have the courage to admit defeat, the perseverance to keep fighting, or the work ethic to get better.  Excuses ruin more athletes than anything else because it‚Äôs infectious. It spreads from one athlete to the next until a team is wiped out.
What does it mean to be coachable?  It means you realize you don‚Äôt know it all.  It means you realize there‚Äôs always room to improve.  It means you realize a coach has been where you are &amp; you‚Äôre open to new info.  It means you realize that in order to be your best you need help.
Bad body language is a momentum killer.   An error or a mistake is going to happen. Knowing that you have teammates who will pick you up when it happens is what prevents the error or mistake from snowballing.   There‚Äôs nothing worse than messing up &amp; having teammates show you up.
Winning teams are never satisfied.  There is a hunger for more when the team is winning.  There is a hunger for redemption when the team is losing.  Winning teams realize there‚Äôs no time for gloating when you‚Äôre on top of the mountain because you could quickly be in the valley.
A winning team looks ahead and moves forward TOGETHER.  If you're looking back or hesitant to get going, you'll get left behind.  A winning team needs everyone on board, regardless of the role.  Embrace who you are, what you do, and how you contribute to your team.
@joelesimpson @MontreatCavBase Thanks for the kind words.
See you there, @littlecaesars. https://t.co/B0U1u8QbZf
Line of sight &amp; visual of mitt by @JArrieta34. Early, open, low target by the catcher. The foundation is set for a quality pitch.   Pitchers: you need to see where you‚Äôre going.  Catchers: Take pride in your presentation. It helps the pitcher, but also the umpire.   #STdrills https://t.co/z1iuOP9hjP
This is a wonderful example of leadership, humility, &amp; honesty. You cannot be defined by what you do, because it‚Äôs not who you are. https://t.co/s5BNlFHxPH
You may be up early when everyone else is sleeping.  It may be cold. It may be dark. It may seem crazy.  It may be a sacrifice now, but you‚Äôll be glad you did it later.  Success doesn‚Äôt come easily. Dreams aren‚Äôt handed to you. Thousands want what you have.  If you want it, work.
It doesn‚Äôt matter who has the most wins, who‚Äôs OBP is the highest, who has the most home runs, who makes the least errors, who leads the team in assists, or who has the most saves.  When you‚Äôre on the field, you have a job ... your job ... to do. Your team is counting on you.
It‚Äôs not that champions never lose, it‚Äôs that champions refuse to be defined by &amp; rarely dwell on losing.  Adversity isn‚Äôt a stumbling block to winners, it‚Äôs a stepping stone to success.
3 second recap of tonight‚Äôs @UMBCAthletics vs @UVAMensHoops game. #MarchMadness https://t.co/KSr8QQLZE2
@jasoncollette @PitchingNinja I was a swim-mover a bit myself. Figured out in order to not completely lose my momentum towards home I needed to almost hunch a bit to stay balanced and have a stronger "base." Helped some. Seems to be what he's doing a bit.
If you've ever watched somebody succeed at something and wondered how, there's a good chance it's because of the work they put in when you weren't watching them.  Those who succeed under the bright lights do so because of preparation away from them.
@PitchingNinja @jasoncollette it's like the glove "swim move" is something he won't eliminate so rather than allowing it to pull him way off line, he hunches the shoulders a bit to counter it. Edwin Physicist Diaz.
Pitchers:  Make every pitch a purpose pitch. You may be trying to throw it low &amp; outside ... but you may miss up &amp; in. So?  Watch the hitter's reaction &amp; plan accordingly for the next pitch.  If we can take a mistake and make it useful, the game ... &amp; your mindset ... will shift.
@jasoncollette @PitchingNinja seems to be a mechanical cue he uses throughout delivery to keep himself on target/closed/whatever term you use. Some guys realize they have some upper half issues they need to be proactive about throughout delivery ... wonder if that's part of it.
You‚Äôll hear it time and time again from a team who just won a championship:  ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have the most talented team. But, we had a team that worked hard, overcame adversity, had a vision, cared for each other, &amp; fought til the end.‚Äù  Character can carry you further than talent.
What I‚Äôve learned from my failures:  1) It‚Äôs not the end of the story, it‚Äôs just the beginning of a new one.   2) They don‚Äôt define me.   3) It‚Äôs not a dead end. It‚Äôs a detour, a u-turn, or a speed bump. Don‚Äôt lose heart.
Selfishness infects a team, because one person with negativity, one person who decides not to work hard, one person who makes a bad off-field choice, or one person who doesn‚Äôt buy in to the culture is one person too many.   It takes one to bring down many.   Winners are selfless.
Too many runners advance a base NOT because of the catcher, but because of the pitcher‚Äôs inability to mix up looks, change up tempo, and slide step.   Holding runners is much more than just having a decent pick off move.   Know the base runner.  Know your tendencies. Change them.
@TheGrandOldGame @Sports_Spectrum Thanks so much.
@davidcsalinas1 @Matt_Baseball10 Social media &amp; ‚Äúonline coaches‚Äù complicate this too, because everyone thinks the more they say the more they know. Not always the case.
@TroyPSilva Players play. Players recognize it‚Äôs about the opportunity over the offer. Players recognize it‚Äôs a blessing to wear a uniform &amp; that thousands would trade places in a heartbeat. Players know &amp; understand that if you have a spot you have a chance. Focus on the why, not the where.
You will never realize your full potential if you're consistently fearing failure.  You'll never know what you're truly made of until you step out in faith.  Decide today that the prospect of success far outweighs the risk of failing.
Championship programs:  1) They win &amp; lose with class. 2) They expect excellence daily. 3) They believe in themselves. 4) They never doubt. 5) They learn from losses. 6) They respect leadership. 7) They dream big. 8) They work hard. 9) They never give up. 10) They are selfless.
The ump asked the hitter to hit one to RF to see if it was too foggy to play. I‚Äôm telling you right now, if that was me, I would‚Äôve whiffed, dropped the bat, walked off the field, and gone home. My career would‚Äôve ended right there in that batter‚Äôs box. https://t.co/ixXigpPR21
Many times, winning a game revolves around one thing.   Eliminate free bases.  The more we cut down on allowing free bases, the more runs we‚Äôll save. The more runs we save, the more games we‚Äôll win.  Over the course of a season, it‚Äôs scary to see how less free bases = more wins.
You‚Äôre never too good for the fundamentals.   New players need to build their foundation on them.   Veteran players need to stay fresh with them.  Everyone needs to know them.   Games are won ... and lost ... by teams that either do the small things right or not.   Master them.
I wrote this week‚Äôs ‚ÄúOver The Hump‚Äù devotional for @nsckennesaw. Hope you‚Äôll read it, be encouraged by it, &amp; sign up for it to be sent directly in your inbox each Wednesday.  https://t.co/LMJcH7COEz
I care about talent as a coach, but I really care about commitment. Lots of athletes can play the game. It‚Äôs important.   There‚Äôs a much smaller percentage that have what it takes to be committed to we &gt; me daily.
A house with a strong foundation will not be brought down easily.   What is your foundation built upon?  A foundation of fear is like sand on a beach. It‚Äôs okay until the waves come.   A foundation of faith is like strong steel. It takes a lot to damage it.  Faith &gt; Fear
Looking back at my coaches over the years, I quickly realize the ones who were hardest on me also cared the most about me.   Expecting excellence from someone &amp; holding them to a high standard may rub them the wrong way.  Those who truly care won‚Äôt let you take the easy way out.
Winning players don't wait to train for crunch time in the midst of crunch time.  Discipline is formed &amp; strength is built long before the bright lights turn on.  Winning players know &amp; understand that to be successful, championships are trained for before the season even starts.
Be prepared. This means knowing what your opponent does well &amp; what their weaknesses are.  However, another aspect of preparedness is knowing what YOU do well.   Don't become so focused on the opponent that you forget what you can do.   Your strengths trump their weaknesses.
You wouldn‚Äôt drive blindfolded.   You need vision.  The same goes for life.  If you want to determine your direction, have a vision. Plan the process step by step &amp; know your route before you floor it.   If you hit a dead end, realign your vision, turn around, &amp; go again.
Thank you so much to everyone for your kind words for my family and me. It means so much. They mean more than you‚Äôll ever know.
Welcome to the @FMRedHawks family, Brennan Metzger. Excited to have such a versatile player &amp; a leader with a championship mindset joining our team. https://t.co/VaiPmg3qTb https://t.co/Xr3ckq0EAf
None of us know what tomorrow holds. I encourage everyone to let their loved ones know how much they mean to you.   In an instant, things change. Make sure, while you have the chance, to hug those who you care for &amp; let them know how you feel.  In the end, you‚Äôll be glad you did.
My grandmother passed away tonight. She leaves a legacy of love, joy, &amp; optimism that is unmatched.   She loved others selflessly, found the positive in everything, &amp; was joyful through anything. She also served as a nurse in the Army.  My heart hurts badly. I miss her already.
If you wouldn‚Äôt mind saying a prayer for my family ... my grandmother has been fighting cancer &amp; we‚Äôre right on the last leg of the fight.   I pray that the legacy of love she leaves permeates everybody I ever encounter &amp; the legacy of optimism brightens even the darkest days.
Warren Buffet lives in the same house he bought 50+ years ago. This is a wonderful lesson in being both content with what you have &amp; financially smart regardless of net worth.   The bottom line: discipline is important in every aspect of our lives.   Focus on what truly matters.
I love this. Way to go, @Orioles. The best way to get the next generation involved in the game is to get them to the game. https://t.co/aVjtIfDVVp
Thankful to @Sports_Spectrum for allowing me the opportunity to write a season long diary of what it‚Äôs like to be a manager in professional baseball. Hope you‚Äôll follow along with me on my journey with the @FMRedHawks.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL
Thankful to be a part. Amazing group of guys. https://t.co/Td5zjvPweF
I am blessed &amp; thankful for the opportunities &amp; platform that God has given me. Thanks to @Sports_Spectrum &amp; @HodgySpeaks for the nice article. Hope you‚Äôll read it &amp; share it.  https://t.co/BEUhjjEuiG
Championship teams fight for each other.  Championship teams don‚Äôt accept mediocrity.  Championship teams do little things right daily.  Championship teams accept constructive criticism well.  Championship teams win &amp; lose with class.  Championship teams don‚Äôt fear the opponent.
A person with average talent who displays a daily dedication to the team is more impressive than someone with a lot of talent but is only in it for themselves.  One helps a team &amp; one hinders a team.  You will improve when you ask how you can help the team improve.
Pitchers can‚Äôt blame catchers for everything. At some point, you have to grow up &amp; take responsibility.  Yes, the catcher puts down the sign, but you have the ability to shake off.  Yes, the catcher has to throw a runner out, but you have to mix looks &amp; be quick to home.  Own it.
@PitchingNinja ...because when it counts, that same pitch could cost your team a season. Expect excellence.
We have a choice: to let failure define us or to let failure realign us. Each setback can be learned from. The turning point on our path to greatness is when a bad situation doesn‚Äôt derail us, but it causes us to pause, think, learn, grow, &amp; move on more wisely than ever before.
One of the biggest hindrances to an athlete's improvement isn't a lack of ability or talent. It's a lack of coachability.  The best coaches in the world can't help someone that isn't interested in learning.  There's never a time in life when we've mastered it all. Be coachable.
This is, without a doubt, the best definition of ‚Äúteam‚Äù that I‚Äôve ever seen. They are more than teammates ... they are brothers. When we &gt; me is the focus of the team, big things happen on the field &amp; lives are changed off it.   Amazing. https://t.co/Zaog5mEoC1
Your coaches and teammates deserve your best every single day. Championship teams are made up of selfless people.  Your best doesn't just mean on the field, because often, off the field decisions and actions are just as important.  Take care of yourself in every aspect of life.
Play hard.   Every pitch. Every out. Every inning. Every game. Every day.  We don‚Äôt know when our chance may come, so we might as well give it all we‚Äôve got every single day.   It‚Äôs easier to not make it from lack of talent than it is from lack of effort. I promise.
Nice play, @White_Mamba25_. Can we all acknowledge the umpire falling straight down and still having the wherewithal to call him out? https://t.co/lSaODnqzYo
Winners are positive.  Winners are hard workers. Winners are selfless. Winners don‚Äôt complain. Winners learn from failure. Winners stay humble.  Winners make others better.
A baby learns to walk one step at a time.  A kid learns math one step at a time.  Success is achieved one step at a time.  There‚Äôs a big misconception that success will just happen. Not true.  Success is the daily drive &amp; determination built over years of planning &amp; perseverance.
A great team will hold you accountable for your actions &amp; words.  If you mess up, admit it &amp; fix it.   If you say it, back it up.     A great team is like family. Many different people who share a common  goal &amp; who come together when it matters most to achieve something  great.
What is easy isn‚Äôt always worth it.   What is worth it isn‚Äôt always easy.   The point? Don‚Äôt give in and don‚Äôt give up. You may feel like it‚Äôs hopeless, not worth it, or too much trouble.   In the end, those who achieve greatness overcame adversity, failure, and pushed through.
It's really easy to complain about practice, complain about coaches, complain about teammates, complain about field conditions, &amp; complain about weather.  Winners don't complain. Winners find the best out of every situation. If there isn't a best, they make a best.   Be a winner.
The problem isn‚Äôt curveballs as much as it is overuse.  Have a pitch count, have a plan, &amp; have a rest.   Kids are not going pro at 8, 10, or 13, but you could prevent them from an opportunity down the road with careless throwing &amp; lack of planning.
Teaching an athlete one way to do it is what I refer to as cookie cutter coaching. This tells me the coach may only know one way to do it.   Athletes learn a number of different ways. If you want to effectively teach them, you must effectively learn who they are &amp; why they play.
Outfielders shouldn‚Äôt be concerned with showing arm strength from the wall to home. It‚Äôs not about you.  Hit a cutoff. Knowing the game &amp; situation is more important than a ‚Äúcannon.‚Äù  Too many games are lost because a selfish player is trying to show off &amp; allows an extra base.
I didn‚Äôt learn from success. If anything, I learned from failures &amp; setbacks.   It‚Äôs easy to be positive, thankful, &amp; happy when things are going your way. Who you truly are, though, is how you are when times get tough.  Though it‚Äôs not easy, you‚Äôll learn lessons from losses.
If you lose a game because the other team was better than you, that‚Äôs acceptable.   If you lose a game because the other team outworked you, that‚Äôs not acceptable.   Control the controllables. Work hard, be a pro on &amp; off the field, &amp; commit to becoming the best you can be.
You step onto the field at a serious disadvantage when you step onto the field doubting your abilities.   The truth is, even those who are less talented can beat those who are more talented with some heart, hustle, and grit.   Never underestimate the power of confidence &amp; faith.
Never https://t.co/aHmpxIbLU6
The best players are also the most selfless. They recognize that, in order for the team to win, they have to give up some things.  Move a runner over, hit a sac fly, bunt, come in for one hitter, etc.   Without a WE &gt; ME mentality, big things can‚Äôt happen.
Coaches want to know why they can‚Äôt get the most out of players seconds after screaming at them for not doing something correctly.  It‚Äôs a proven fact that humans cannot succeed as easily under pressure.  Always remember how hard the game was to play before opening your mouth.
When you wake up every day, remind yourself that you now have another chance.   You can choose your attitude.  You can choose your outlook.  You can choose your friends.  You can choose your path.   Starting now, take control.
Practice ... makes ... perfeOHHHH. https://t.co/bIDj38aAu1
I‚Äôve been in professional baseball 13+ years now, and the recipe for success hasn‚Äôt changed one bit.   Those who succeed do so with an unrelenting faith, an unmatched work ethic, an unbelievable passion, unreal grit, an unassuming humbleness, and an unequivocal love for the game.
Baseball is an interesting game.   It‚Äôs extremely results-oriented, but in order to get results you have to be extremely process-oriented.  Results don‚Äôt just happen. Putting in work every single day while honestly self-evaluating as you make progress is the best way to go.
If you hit a ball that‚Äôs a ‚Äúsure out,‚Äù remember two things:  1) Always run it out. Anything can happen. It‚Äôd be bad to run half speed &amp; still be out when you could‚Äôve been safe. Too many games are lost that way.   2) Running it out is professional. Take pride in what you do.
Team building should be an integral part of every coach's arsenal. Why?  -Teams that know each other OFF the field will gel ON it. -Teams that show up &amp; play as individuals will never succeed.  Make it a priority. Create a family feel around the team to get the most out of it!
A fear of failure will hold you back.  When you put that uniform on, you‚Äôre doing what thousands wish they could do.  Instead of wondering what‚Äôll happen if you fail, start thinking about what could happen if you succeed.  Too many never reach their full potential due to fear.
Most point to the loss as the turning point in the entire season. I turn to the next game.  How did you handle the loss? Did it snowball on you? Did you get negative? Did you give up?  Losing isn't the point where everything goes downhill, the next day is.  Stay positive &amp; fight.
Baseball taught me:  1) to stay humble when it‚Äôs going well &amp; to stay positive when it‚Äôs not.  2) regardless of where you come from or who you are, perseverance, hard work, &amp; hustle gives you a shot.  3) it‚Äôs not failure that defines you but how you react to failure that matters.
Showing up to the ballpark already thinking that the other team is better than you has basically given you an L before you even stepped foot on the field.   It shouldn‚Äôt matter who they are or what their record is.   Heart and hustle go a long way. Hard work &amp; grit can carry you.
Losing is part of life. Regardless of what others say, you will lose &amp; it will make you better.  When you lose:  1) Treat it as a lesson. What can you learn from it?  2) Exhibit class and sportsmanship. It won't be the last time it happens.    3) Use it as fuel for the next game.
Scouts &amp; evaluators aren‚Äôt interested in your perfection.   They are, however, interested in how you respond from your imperfections.   Many things aren‚Äôt controllable. Body language &amp; attitude are completely controllable. Focus on those things &amp; you‚Äôll grow your character a lot.
@JobesJacobe Don‚Äôt approach it like you know more (even if you do) or that you‚Äôre mad. Try to have a civil conversation about why you disagree and hear his out. When you keep it two sided and civil, good things come from it. Issues arise when one side goes on the attack.
9 out of 10 times, the culture of your organization or team isn't altered when you win, but when you lose.   The reason is simple. More people will buy in or jump ship depending on how you handle adversity &amp; whether or not you lead them through or throw them out.
Parents of athletes:  - Let your kid fight their own battle. Issues should be handled without parent intervention. Teach them to act like grown ups.  - Don‚Äôt yell at their coach in front of them. It teaches them to disrespect authority.  - They‚Äôre already coached. Just love them.
The best teams know everything about each other.   The best teams get along on &amp; off the field.   The best teams feel like family.   The best teams want the best for each other.   The best teams support each other win or lose.   The best teams expect excellence every single day.
My grandmother has cancer &amp; is barely hanging on. She‚Äôs strong, positive, &amp; a big influence in my life.   She told me it‚Äôs amazing how fast life flies by. She said to not worry about the small stuff, give thanks for blessings, &amp; enjoy every single second. I plan to do just that.
You will face adversity.  It‚Äôs not adversity that will define you.   It‚Äôs how you handle adversity that will define you.  Adversity teaches you about yourself, teaches others about you, and shows everyone what it looks like to walk through fire and come out stronger.
Championship programs:  - send people out much better than when they came in.  - promote the family feel where everyone matters.  - expect excellence &amp; eliminate excuses.  - promote winning &amp; learn through losing.  - do the little things correctly every single day.

Amazing things could happen if we would shift our mindset from the moment we wake up every day til the moment we lay our head on the pillow every night.   Instead of immediately focusing on all the negative, wake up &amp; give thanks for the blessings in your life. Try it. It works.
Being able to stare failure in the face &amp; take a leap of faith is what true strength is all about.   Too many people play it safe. Too many people make excuses for why it won‚Äôt work.   If you‚Äôre afraid of failing you‚Äôll never take off the training wheels.  Go for it.
Far too often I hear excuses about why someone can‚Äôt do something. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be in your dictionary.   If you want to achieve greatness, dream big ... work hard ... and overcome obstacles.   Someone will ... why not you?
During adversity:  1) recognize it as a detour, not a dead end.   2) remember to keep moving forward.   3) rekindle the positivity that you built up in the good times &amp; use it as you persevere through the tough ones.   4) remind yourself that your example will encourage others.
If you want to win big games then you‚Äôve got to do the little things right.   More times than not a game‚Äôs outcome is determined by whether or not you got that bunt down, moved that runner over, made that pitch, fielded that ball, made that throw, etc.   Master the little things.
You either put work in or you didn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt matter how you spin it, what you say, or what others think.   The truth will come out on the field. Those who work hard off the field will enjoy success on it.   You‚Äôre never a finished product. Sitting around does no one any good.
It‚Äôs one thing to respect the talent of another player.   It‚Äôs another thing to play scared because you‚Äôre afraid the other player will beat you.   Go out &amp; face it head on. If you lose you‚Äôll learn &amp; if you win you‚Äôll prove something to yourself.

@davehultin @FMRedHawks Thanks, man. Means a lot. See you at Newman!
3 things I wish I had learned earlier in baseball:  1) Coaches that were the hardest on me cared the most about me.  2) Look around &amp; recognize that you're doing what thousands wish they could do. Don't take a second for granted.  3) Have fun. It'll be over before you know it.
There is no greater destroyer of a season than a bunch of individuals playing for themselves. The essence of a team is that the individuals gel &amp; mold to become family and play as one unit.
I‚Äôm thankful for baseball. It‚Äôs taken me places I never knew existed, allowed me to meet people I never would‚Äôve otherwise, &amp; gives me an ability to make memories with my family I‚Äôll never forget. I‚Äôll be writing about my experiences with @Sports_Spectrum: https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL https://t.co/2XoVXCY1KH
Too many leaders value peace over truth. There are things that must be said ... in love ... to members of your team that may upset them in the short term. As long as it's delivered with grace &amp; truth, it will benefit them in the long run. Don't let it go to avoid confrontation.
Practice &amp; earlywork is a time to get better. Too often we show up and go about our business halfheartedly.  If you won‚Äôt do it right in practice, don‚Äôt bother doing it.   When the time comes to execute in-game &amp; you make a mistake, it hurts worse when it‚Äôs from a lack of effort.
You can say whatever you want, but the lasting impact will be made based upon what you do. Your teammates &amp; coaches appreciate positive talk &amp; encouraging words but everything changes when you live it out.
You should respect yourself, the uniform, your team, and your coaches to run the ball out every single time ... even if you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs an out.   It‚Äôs professional, it‚Äôs a reflection of who you are &amp; what you‚Äôve been taught, and it puts pressure on the defense. You never know.
Want to impress your coach? It‚Äôs not the one time display of incredible talent. It‚Äôs the day to day dedication, perseverance, grit, heart, hustle, and determination necessary to compete at a high level. Coaches are impressed by those who buy in, sell out, &amp; chase their dreams.
Make the play, but SET YOUR FEET before you throw. It would be a shame to stop the ball like that yet throw it away in the end. Know the runner, know your arm, &amp; remember that you have more time than you think you do.   #STdrills https://t.co/39BEHs47oK
Coaches don't run you through team defense, base running, PFP, bullpens, batting practice, or bunt plays because you don't know how to do it ... they do it so that when the game is on the line you execute your job instinctually. We lock up and forget when we're unprepared.
I am writing a season-long journal on @Sports_Spectrum which chronicles the life of professional baseball from my perspective. I would love it if you‚Äôd follow along. My goal is to take you behind the scenes a bit &amp; share with you what it‚Äôs all about.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL
You want the results but you don‚Äôt want to put in the work? Not going to happen.   Results reflect reps.   Wherever you are &amp; whatever you do, remember there is someone working harder than you &amp; they want what you have. Be humble &amp; be content but never be satisfied. Let‚Äôs go.
Second after second, minute after minute, hour after hour, day after day, and step after step ... trust the process. You may not be where you want to be right now, but the key is to keep moving forward. Baby steps turn into giant leaps over time if you don't give up.
Not being able to self-evaluate hinders more people than a lack of talent does. If you‚Äôre never honest enough with yourself about the areas in which you need to grow, you‚Äôll never grow. It‚Äôs not always easy, but it‚Äôs always necessary.
You only get one first impression &amp; often, only one opportunity to stand out. The truth is, however, that we don‚Äôt know when or how that chance will come. So, always be ready. Never take a second for granted. Often, chances come when we least expect it. Be prepared.
We are one bad moment away from losing everything we‚Äôve worked our whole lives for. Remember, who you surround yourself with is important &amp; integral to who you‚Äôre becoming. Be smart, stay humble, &amp; give thanks every day for those who lift you up, keep you going, &amp; help you grow.
Failure. Nobody likes to talk about it but everyone needs to hear it. Nobody that has achieved excellence has done so without a setback, a failure, or a roadblock. It‚Äôs not about the failure, it‚Äôs about the response. Love this. Thanks @RaginCajunsBSB https://t.co/10WpBkzaxQ
I‚Äôm excited about having everyone follow me on a journey through a professional baseball season from a manager‚Äôs perspective. @Sports_Spectrum and I have partnered up in this endeavor &amp; I would be honored if you would join me.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL  @FMRedHawks
You may have lost, but that loss can quickly become a lesson with the right mindset. It‚Äôs okay to be upset. The problem arises when we let it define us. Get up and move on more wisely. It‚Äôs not that you‚Äôll never make mistakes. It‚Äôs that you shouldn‚Äôt make the same mistake twice.
The latest issue of ‚ÄúThe Good Life‚Äù magazine is out now. Someone thought it would be a good idea to put me on the cover &amp; do a feature, so here it is. Hope you enjoy!   @FMRedHawks    https://t.co/SRIwDYcVLN
I‚Äôm excited to partner with @Sports_Spectrum on a season-long ‚ÄúDiary of a Minor League Manager.‚Äù This will give you an inside look into what life is like in pro baseball at the minor league level from my perspective. Today, we released the intro post.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL
When you throw a pitch you want &amp; it‚Äôs not called in your favor how do you react? The body language you present may play a factor in how an umpire calls the rest of the game. Besides that, poor body language let‚Äôs the opponent know they‚Äôve got you &amp; affects the rest of your game.
You are where you are for a reason. Don‚Äôt dwell on your location, work hard to keep moving towards your goals &amp; dreams. Those who achieved greatness were content but never satisfied where they were. Stay hungry &amp; stay humble.
‚ÄúHow many pitches can I execute in my 110 pitch starts?‚Äù - @LGio27.  Making pitches is the name of the game, but don‚Äôt think of your outing any other way but pitch by pitch. Don‚Äôt think about winning the game. Think about winning each pitch.   #STdrills   https://t.co/p7oIVbdKOB
Welcome, March. A new month. A fresh start. A clean slate. Give thanks for the blessings and learn from the struggles. The best time to start is right now. Get up, go out, and make it happen.
@PitchingNinja Love it, @LMcCullers43. Goes against rhythm &amp; timing of 99% of our deliveries, which makes it tough to master. When done correctly, it exposes the inner "robot" in every hitter. They become accustomed to learning/training for certain cues that even a small pause works wonders.
@JDCmusic every day calls for a donut.
Errors are excusable, poor body language is not. Coaches don‚Äôt expect perfection, but they do expect professionalism &amp; maturity. If you want to get on the field &amp; stay on the field, then it‚Äôs time to show up, step up, and grow up.
The most important pitches you‚Äôll make all game long come from the stretch with runners in scoring position. Why, then, do we only give the stretch a 5-7 pitch practice window in bullpens? We should throw 50%, if not 75% of our pen from the stretch. Success doesn‚Äôt just happen.
Interesting read from @based_ball about the decline of the wind up.   https://t.co/7TLBIuR78g
The best thing someone can do for a kid is make them stand up to their superiors &amp; speak up for themselves. If they aren‚Äôt happy, learn to confront it head on. The longer someone else does the dirty work for them, the longer they won‚Äôt know what being an adult is all about.
There are two ways to think:     -From a negative viewpoint, which increases PRESSURE.  or    -From a positive viewpoint, which increases CONFIDENCE.  The choice is yours.
Oh my Maddux. #STdrills @LMcCullers43 https://t.co/kGLRxCOEkC
Love this @BostonGlobe article about the @RedSox new offensive approach. Being more aggressive earlier in the count may pay big dividends. Read: https://t.co/r0dKDFkBiZ
Fair or not, the parent is a big factor in what coaches/evaluators/scouts think about an athlete. The helicopter/overbearing parent, the "my kid is a 1st rounder parent, or the "peering over the scout's shoulder to see notes" parent isn't good &amp; reflects negatively on your child.
Expect excellence. Eliminate excuses. Find a way.
We show up to the field every day and just act like it‚Äôs another ho-hum day. We complain, we go through the motions, then we go home. What we‚Äôve forgotten is that any day could be our last &amp; thousands would trade places with us in an instant. It‚Äôs time to play with passion daily.
I love that he runs right out of the box. He doesn‚Äôt watch, he doesn‚Äôt bat flip, he doesn‚Äôt taunt, he just runs. Every single base matters every single game.  Those one run losses can quickly be turned around with this type of effort every time. #STdrills https://t.co/K4utDqLtv1
If your dream, vision, and goals all involve extraordinary things yet your work ethic is nothing but ordinary, what‚Äôs the point? Those who achieve greatness work harder than anyone else to reach it. Don‚Äôt regret a second of chasing a dream, work for it, don‚Äôt just wish for it.
‚ÄúWhy are they so hard on me‚Äù right now usually becomes ‚Äúthey really cared about me‚Äù later.
Make a way, not an excuse. The best teammates set a high standard from the other ones on the field. Don‚Äôt get defensive, get determined. Take criticism as a challenge &amp; a warning. A team always wants to improve &amp; give their best.
Yelling doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything unless your objective is to come across as a jerk. Be constructive in your criticism, clear in your communication, and confident enough to know when encouragement is needed instead of negativity.
When you cross those white lines, that switch should flip. I‚Äôm all for being friends with people on the other team, but when it‚Äôs game time, set those aside. It is possible to be friends with people but also be competitive &amp; give your best for your teammates.
Everyone is a good teammate when you‚Äôre winning. The true leaders &amp; the best teammates are revealed in tough times when your back is against the wall.   Character is revealed through adversity. Be the type of teammate who lifts up when it may be easier to put down.
Many times, those who are hardest on us care the most about us. Tough love &amp; constructive criticism are pivotal in growth. We all need people in our lives who can tell us where we need to improve, hold us accountable when things aren‚Äôt going well, &amp; be honest when others won‚Äôt.
Couldn‚Äôt be happier to have Matt on board as our GM. He‚Äôs incredibly smart &amp; I‚Äôm thankful to work alongside a guy who can blend baseball &amp; business so well. #FMRedHawks @FMRedHawks https://t.co/IpIl712zyZ
The best coaches you‚Äôll ever have will demand the most from you, be the toughest on you, be truthful with you no matter what, &amp; constructively criticize you constantly. Those who care the most about you will expect the most of you.
Strike 1 is important, but I would argue that the 1-1 count pitch is the most important and most pivotal pitch in the entire at bat. The 1-2 vs 2-1 difference is astounding. Pitchers: when ahead in the count, go for the strikeout &amp; when behind in the count, go for the result.
‚ÄúOvernight success‚Äù isn‚Äôt true. True success comes from a dream, a vision, a plan, adversity, setbacks, perseverance, grit, determination, &amp; faith. Success is often built upon YEARS, TEARS, &amp; FEARS. Years in the making, tears in the process, &amp; fears that are overcome.
@JonAcuff How do you market &amp; promote yourself without being a) annoying, b) overbearing, or c) too salesy?
There is a lot of truth to the statement that ‚Äúyou should only look down on someone when you‚Äôre helping them back up.‚Äù We should never be above anyone in terms of status, because the more influence we‚Äôre given the more we should serve others.
Thanks to @mikelinch for letting be a part of Lunch With A Leader today at @nsckennesaw. Thankful to share whenever I can &amp; thankful for the platform. Looking forward to the next one!
I am very excited to begin working with Matt as he takes on the role of our new GM. Our early conversations &amp; meetings have gone so well. He‚Äôs very talented, communicates well, and loves Fargo-Moorhead. Couldn‚Äôt be happier for him to come aboard! https://t.co/XzyuV1Zrab
. @Rangers fans: I highly recommend you check out the latest Linch With A Leader podcast with @mikelinch &amp; 3B coach Tony Beasley. Few are respected and loved like Tony. Hearing from him about overcoming cancer, leadership, etc. is a must! https://t.co/fpM7tRPHtb @Sullivan_Ranger
If you want to be successful when the lights are the brightest &amp; the game means the most, you‚Äôve got to train hard when the lights are off &amp; no one is watching. Our character is built &amp; our skills are sharpened when we push ourselves day by day &amp; expect excellence continuously.
My life has now been changed forever. Thank you. https://t.co/y24Sj4FUsn
When it‚Äôs all said and done, who you were, how you impacted those around you, and how you treated others will matter more than any success or awards. Far too often we spend our whole lives chasing what we think matters &amp; we end up neglecting what truly matters.
A misconception is that you only have to be a good teammate when you‚Äôre at the field. The truth is, being a good teammate is even more important away from the field. To be your best ON the field, you must take care of yourself OFF the field. Nutrition, sleep, smart choices, etc.
‚Ä¢Show up early. If you're on time, you're probably late.   ‚Ä¢Be a good teammate. Your team is your family during this season.   ‚Ä¢Work hard.
Body language speaks louder than any words ever will. Scouts notice. Coaches notice. Teammates notice.
@MLB Sorry about that guys, I never learned how to drive a stick.
Pitchers-When a player on the field makes an error while you're on the mound, the worst thing you can do is show bad body language. It reflects poorly on you (mental makeup) but also shows your selfishness. Keep your composure, let your teammate know you have their back, &amp; pitch.
Statistically speaking, most players won't go pro in baseball. However, the game still teaches amazing life lessons. Either way it's a win.
Small things add up to win big games. @Andrelton with the deke cutoff play is one of the best ‚Äúthinking on your toes‚Äù plays I‚Äôve ever seen. https://t.co/zA4oGwjMQM
The pitch itself is nasty, yes. The key to this pitch, however, is the fastball arm speed. Deception fools the hitter, movement is icing on the cake. (GIF: @PitchingNinja) #STdrills https://t.co/LwuiPdEAMj
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a devoted heart if you have a distracted heart.‚Äù  {@mikelinch}
@mlbbowman If you can't produce runs on certain days, save runs.
Want to know what a true team looks like? Grit &amp; fight til the last out, encouraging of teammates even when it‚Äôs not going well, everyone knowing &amp; embracing their roles regardless of the size, no pouting, no complaining, no whining, and every single day feels like family.
Part of being an effective leader is preaching accountability and excellence. Then, when those things are taken advantage of or not lived up to, acting on accountability. Setting the tone with discipline &amp; the bar high is pivotal to the success &amp; failure of the team as a whole.
Who you TRULY are is who you become when adversity strikes.
This is spring training. Games don‚Äôt count. Runs don‚Äôt matter. Stats aren‚Äôt important. However, when you take pride in what you do, this is the result. Play with passion &amp; purpose when it doesn‚Äôt matter so that you‚Äôre prepared for when it does. #STdrills https://t.co/wZXR72kXp6
Notice the take is just as aggressive as the swing. You should be fully committed to swinging &amp; then decide to take. Not the alternative. #STdrills https://t.co/HBwE947Y25
Good talent can get you through a lack of work ethic for a little while. But, good work ethic can get you through a lack of talent for a long time. Work. Hard. Every. Single. Day.
@kah1423 Nice win coach. Loved seeing the boys never get down &amp; show some grit til the end. Also, the starter gave up early runs but buckled down and kept you in the game. Did his job! That‚Äôs the making of a really good team right there.
@bottlerocket My favorite is every dad on the plane when it lands in Atlanta, who add to the flight attendant‚Äôs ‚Äúwelcome to Atlanta‚Äù with ‚Äúwhere the players play‚Äù then laugh, tighten their crocs, and stand up way too early to clog the aisle.
If coaches would talk to their players more about their setbacks, failures, and shortcomings ... the fear of failure would diminish greatly. If you want to meet someone where they are, start with failures, because nobody is perfect. The best examples are those who OVERCAME.
Baseball is not a game for the lazy. With so many physical &amp; mental components, it's imperative to continue working hard to achieve success. There are no days off.
Championship teams:  -Pick each other up.  -Embrace adversity.  -Find the lesson in losses. -Never get complacent. -Expect excellence. -Believe in each other.  -Have a vision.  -Set goals. -Don‚Äôt fear failure.  -Set the bar high.  -Are selfless. -Play hard until the very end.
Many of the errors that occur in baseball aren't a result of the initial bobble. They come from the resulting panic &amp; rushing. Breathe.
@JonGordon11 Often, those are the best ones. Real, unrehearsed, straight from the heart. Love it.
Leaders aren't always vocal. A leader can lead by example as well. Strive to lead by showing others how it should be done every single time.
Why would you give anything less than your best every single day? A lot of people invest a lot of time, energy, and money into this for YOU.
It's not that you'll never give up runs. It's that you must learn to limit the damage and prevent the big innings. Make pitches.
A good teammate is encouraging, selfless, &amp; positive. A bad teammate hinders, is selfish, &amp; negative.
What you do is what you do. Who you are is your identity. Sports may be what you do, but it‚Äôs not who you are. Coaches and scouts at the next level look at both who you are and what you do when making a decision about you. Make sure who you are lines up with what you want to do.
Do as the game dictates. Use all fields. At times, you have to throw your stats out of the window for the sake of the team. That‚Äôs what a good teammate is all about. You can‚Äôt just expect to do it though. Be intentional in the cage.   We &gt; Me.   #STdrills  https://t.co/0Ca2KwxX4v
Joey Votto said, "Let the ball be your feedback." We work so much on technical and mechanical issues with a swing that we forget the best teacher can be what the result is. Focus on and learn from the trajectory, spin, and actions of the baseball after you make contact. #STdrills
The odds aren't in your favor to play at the next level. Embrace it. Use it as fuel to motivate you every single day. Why not you?
Developing a championship culture gives players and staff short term goals, long term aspirations, &amp; huge dreams. It allows them to take risks knowing that you‚Äôll be there to catch them if they fall, &amp; it develops serious perseverance.
You can‚Äôt expect to do something a few times &amp; master it. Becoming great &amp; expecting excellence takes dedication, perseverance, &amp; lots of work. There‚Äôs always somebody out there working harder than you who wants what you want. Don‚Äôt wait for it to happen-make it happen. #STdrills https://t.co/LI8Kswdr9o
Learn to read the ball off the bat. There is a time to wait back &amp; read a hop, but if you see that ball on the ground ... go get it. Get the ball, don‚Äôt let it get you. #STdrills https://t.co/26gtahbyKw
You win as a team and you lose as a team. Too many individuals can infect any momentum a team has or they can expedite any losing streak. The 0-4 pouting when the team wins &amp; the 3-4 celebrating when the team loses must stop. Your teammates deserve better than that.
Catch the ball first, find the bag next. Hit the ‚Äúfair‚Äù or inside part of the bag, then stay in fair territory to avoid a collision with the runner. When you‚Äôve made the out, pivot and check to make sure no other runners (if any) are advancing. #STdrills https://t.co/VnYbaCc2Ah
Ok, I‚Äôll try. https://t.co/R4jP2UPFS4
Win as a team ... with class.  Lose as a team ... with class.  Wear the uniform ... with class. Represent yourself ... with class. Treat coaches ... with class. Treat success ... with class. Treat failure ... with class. Play the game ... with class.
Notice that he doesn‚Äôt drift to the baseball. He runs hard to the spot, using his hand as a guide since he was close to the wall, &amp; then got under it before timing the jump. Even if you‚Äôre not at the wall, don‚Äôt drift to the spot, get to it. #STdrills https://t.co/Z2CuKiRZs6
Hustle ON &amp; hustle OFF the field. Respect the game &amp; respect your coaches. It‚Äôs professionalism at its best. There should never be a time where you feel it‚Äôs necessary to walk. Show some heart &amp; show some hustle every time you cross those lines. #STdrills https://t.co/xB4Wi72qLf
‚ÄúWhy would we waste our time learning how to slide, coach? If I‚Äôm going to play pro ball, I‚Äôll never do this. Can‚Äôt we just hit or something?‚Äù #STdrills https://t.co/1pp1K69e7R
If you want to separate yourself from the rest in the outfield, you must work on reading the ball, footwork, and changing directions. A good outfielder knows this and a great outfielder does this. #STdrills https://t.co/X6UcyKClJ0
@EddieTaubensee It‚Äôs a fungo. Everyone is safe.
There are no wasted movements in the cage. Notice the thought &amp; intent that goes into every swing AND every take. There is no sense of urgency. Knowing your swing &amp; movements in the cage are essential to in-game success. Make it a habit. #STdrills https://t.co/Y6WwSCJHuw
@PitchingNinja @DrivelineBB His stuff is plus. We‚Äôre excited to have him in a @FMRedHawks uni.
Progress happens away from the bright lights &amp; cheering crowd. This is where the foundation is laid. The hardest thing to do is work hard when no one watches. The easiest thing to do is say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to that later.‚Äù Don‚Äôt miss an opportunity because you‚Äôre unprepared. #STdrills https://t.co/z3oTikL34C
As a catcher, the target you give is crucial. Give it early &amp; present it with the understanding that, visually, it‚Äôs a pitcher‚Äôs lifeline. Also, how you receive &amp; present the throw are critical to an umpire‚Äôs call. Often this can be the difference between a ball/strike. #STdrills https://t.co/VUD3Y54J3Z
I would be honored if you would listen to this podcast I did with @MinorLgeReport. We talk about the @FMRedHawks, baseball in general, &amp; more. It will be a weekly podcast during the season where you'll actually be able to send in questions for me!  https://t.co/rbA61v7c6U

If you step onto the field without a plan, you will waste time, energy, and effort. It starts with a dream, continues with a vision, and is realized with a plan &amp; purpose.
When it comes to an approach on offense, a key phrase should be, ‚Äúfind a way.‚Äù This isn't a haphazard walk to the box with a "hope I can" mentality. We must KNOW the pitcher, UNDERSTAND their thought process, &amp; ADJUST to their game plan. Not all outs are bad by the way. #STdrills

Fielding the ball is only the beginning at 1B. When the pitcher is coming to cover, a good feed (leading him toward the bag) and a catchable feed (hit him in the chest) are of utmost importance. This should be worked on &amp; mastered to play a solid 1B. #STdrills https://t.co/uVTJwafAHk
. @FMRedHawks https://t.co/3ETgkWHRlo
Volume up &amp; listen. The catcher is the shot caller on the infield and needs to be heard. Even the play that everyone knows where the ball is going, you can hear Russell Martin calling ‚Äúone one one.‚Äù Communication on the field is essential. #STdrills https://t.co/Zo7oYbg4D9
Simple drills &amp; not a lot of materials can transform your practice. Bunting properly &amp; to the right locations is often the difference between winning &amp; losing those close games. Don‚Äôt wait for runs, produce them. Productive outs are key. #STdrills https://t.co/gAvZTMsYBZ
I‚Äôm 32 years old, and I just jumped a car for the first time. Good thing I‚Äôm still here to tweet this. Could‚Äôve been like https://t.co/JtuEScNecW
‚ÄúCome on coach. I want to hit on the field. The cage is boring &amp; I get so much more done out there. Pros always hit on the field, anyways!‚Äù #STdrills https://t.co/dOysUveQRV
Each time you put on that uniform you are:  -Representing your team. -Representing your family. -Representing yourself. -Representing your community. -Representing your coaches. -Representing the game.  Take it seriously and give thanks. THOUSANDS would gladly trade with you.
Every movement you make on the field should have a purpose. There is a big difference between motion and progress.
The most important things a pitcher can do when fielding a bunt &amp; pivoting to throw is STAY LOW, STAY FOCUSED, &amp; STAY CALM. Errors are caused by rushing the body &amp; trying to rush the throw combined with aiming the throw. Trust your abilities &amp; take your PFPs seriously. #STdrills https://t.co/Q8L8eYuLvw
When you find your WHY you will find your WAY.
We strive to make the name on the back of our jersey known, and we neglect the name on the front of it. The interesting thing is what happens when you care more about the name on the front of the jersey than the back. Not only does your play improve, but so does your reputation.
Baserunning &amp; the footwork involved are critical. That‚Äôs why, from T-Ball to the big leagues, it‚Äôs worked on. It shouldn‚Äôt be boring if it‚Äôs a part of something you love. (Hit the inside part of the bag with your right foot). #STdrills https://t.co/oTkZzWZCpr
Scouts &amp; recruiters are interested in your talents as a ballplayer ... but a lot of the final decision rests on you me character as a person. Clean it up &amp; remember ... if you want to be a pro, act like one.
Good, clean transfer, nice powerful position to throw, &amp; gaining ground with feet as it all happens. Details are key &amp; often the difference in throwing runners out or not. The pitcher should keep them off base, but the catcher should hold them. #STdrills https://t.co/O3tvW0375t
Excited to welcome Trey McNutt back to the @FMRedHawks for the 2018 season! Trey has one of the best arms in the league. The @DrivelineBB alum and former #Cubs RHP is poised for big things this year!   https://t.co/3mJFOaTA1G https://t.co/cRTwZB2prX
It‚Äôs so easy to complain. Complaining about practice, complaining about umpires, complaining about the field, complaining about the weather ... on &amp; on. Negativity &amp; complaining are a progress killer. Want to be the best teammate you can be? Quit complaining &amp; start working.

@KDB_MLB I‚Äôm still at the wake up part.
Anyone can be positive &amp; work hard when things are going well. The true character of an individual is revealed when things aren‚Äôt going their way &amp; times get tough. You‚Äôll learn a lot through adversity but you‚Äôll also teach others a lot through adversity too.
‚ÄúThe worst part of my day is agilities and warmups. I can‚Äôt believe we waste our time doing this. I want to get to pro ball, then I can do whatever I want. I can just show up and play.‚Äù #STdrills https://t.co/KS0205GwwG
Winners aren‚Äôt people that never lose. Winners are people that learn from losing better than other people.
Anyone can coach. Few can lead. One is a title given to almost anyone in  an authority position athletically. The other is a description that is  earned from walking in when everyone else is walking out. Coaches tell  you how to get through it, leaders go through it with you.
If your mindset is "I hope I can" rather than "I know I can" you're doing yourself a disservice. Show up daily believing in yourself, your abilities, &amp; the work you put in to be successful.
Telling your athletes stories of when you fell short or failed isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness. Actually, it helps reduce anxiety &amp; a fear of failure in them. If their coach isn‚Äôt perfect, it allows them room to take risks too. True strength is found in those who failed &amp; got back up.
@robgreene @Fergie Rob. Listen again. Just .... listen. üòÇ
A championship team will never defer blame, make excuses, or give up. A championship team adopts each other as family, plays like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, &amp; out-works anyone &amp; everyone. Want to be a championship team? Beginning right now expect nothing but excellence every day.
Check out where his feet are at the moment he catches the ball. He‚Äôs in prime position to transfer &amp; throw (fielding the ball off his back leg). Footwork as an infielder is so important. Every extra second counts when it comes to getting outs. #STdrills https://t.co/netI4kbGwY

Be a wall. A catcher is a sacrificial position. Give it up for the sake of the team. Be gritty, tough, &amp; smart. Know the other 8 guys better than you know yourself. Above all else, take charge and be a leader. #STdrills https://t.co/WMPvVn1w5D
@bashbrooks2 Keep up the good work, kid. Proud of you.

It‚Äôs not home run derby. It‚Äôs not a time to mess around. In the cage, take each swing &amp; every movement seriously. You can‚Äôt expect to execute when it counts if you mess around when it doesn‚Äôt. #STdrills https://t.co/0vFie9a635
Footwork is a much overlooked yet very important aspect that everyone on the field needs to improve upon. Make it a priority to move better so that you can play better. Sometimes you can improve in small ways that will pay huge dividends. #STdrills https://t.co/3FnwJhgKYS
A big misconception in life is that people who are successful have never failed. I say that‚Äôs false. I would venture to guess that most people who are successful reached that point by walking into, enduring, &amp; walking out of adversity. The strength we need is born in tough times.
Anyone can learn what it takes to be a true team player. The ‚Äúintangibles‚Äù that coaches talk about can be taught and learned. Wake up every day expecting excellence, put the right people around you, and strive to be your best every single moment.
As long as you have that last out, you have a chance. Don't give in and don't give up.
Just because someone is physically strong doesn't make them tough. It's entirely possible to be physically strong and mentally weak. True toughness comes from the grit, heart, and perseverance to face adversity head on, walk through it, &amp; emerge on the other side wiser than ever.
The higher up we get in sports the more complicated we make it. However, every single time, the best ones go back to the basics to be successful. Never lose sight of what got you there.
As a coach, I love teaching the game. However, one of the most rewarding aspects of it all is when a player coaches themselves on the field. It shows they listen, apply, and most of all ... care.
The foundation of success is character, hard work, &amp; determination. Once those are in place, continue honing your skill set &amp; continue learning every single day. A firm foundation, along with training &amp;  an eagerness to learn, is a recipe for success.
Amazing things happen when you stop thinking about yourself and start  thinking about your teammates. Selfless players are the best players.     WE &gt; ME
@Rene_Taubensee 6‚Äô8!
If you want to leave a legacy where you are, roll up your sleeves and get to work. No one is above anyone else. In fact, the best leaders humble themselves and serve those they lead. That, by the way, is the manager of the #Mets. #STdrills https://t.co/YrMytnk4HQ
Leaders:  ‚òëÔ∏è Expect excellence  ‚òëÔ∏è Love before they lead  ‚òëÔ∏è Endlessly encourage  ‚òëÔ∏è Serve selflessly  ‚òëÔ∏è Push positivity  ‚òëÔ∏è Leave a legacy
The teams who are slowed by speed bumps and stopped by obstacles are the same teams who don‚Äôt have their vision in place &amp; goals prioritized. Set the bar high, but set attainable benchmarks along the way. Doing the little things wins big games.
The difference between a good outfielder and a great outfielder is getting a good jump on the baseball. The initial step is pivotal. Some of it is instinctual, but most of it is learned and taught. Pros work on it every day, you can too. #STdrills https://t.co/26kUsJ3ftz
My son just told me his nose was running &amp; without hesitation my response was ‚Äúwell you better go catch it!‚Äù I then proceeded to laugh at myself. Yep, I‚Äôve entered the world of dadding. It‚Äôs official.
I love this. It‚Äôs a small picture of what big time leadership looks like. He could‚Äôve walked by these security guards &amp; not said a word to them. However, a leader knows &amp; understands that everyone plays a part &amp; has a role in making it function. #STdrills https://t.co/Qc1SPzOO2l
If you‚Äôre building your team/organization only around the type of performer they are &amp; take no consideration into the type of person they are, it may work out in the short term. However, over time, great people with some talent always prevail over bad people with lots of talent.
The most important relationship on the field is the pitcher/catcher. A pitcher must feel comfortable with the catcher to trust them, and the catcher must know the pitcher to make the right call. Above that, they must both feel comfortable with each other to be in sync. #STdrills https://t.co/xFedvQv3ZT
Players show up every day focused on themselves, yet they want the team to win. If a team is full of individuals, it will never truly be a team. Want to win? Show up, think of others, and do what you need to do to help. TEAM means family, togetherness, and selflessness.
Coaches use fear tactics to try and motivate players, then wonder why said players won‚Äôt dive, take an extra base, or risk anything beyond the sure thing.   Fear causes timidity. Timidity makes taking risks nearly impossible due to fearing failure.  Encourage. Push. Motivate.
@FMRedHawks Wonder whose tickets those are? üëÄ
A coach looks at talent. But, a coach also looks at how you interact with others, what type of teammate you are, how you represent yourself in the community, what type of grades you make, how you treat your family, and many other things. Don‚Äôt fool yourself. Character matters.
@RonPopeMusic Your number is on speed dial.
@RonPopeMusic We were grinding it out. Wanted to make it big hitting tanks. Instead, you play music and I coach. We tried.
@EddieTaubensee Because you like someone I like. That makes me smile.
A true ‚Äúbanana route‚Äù to first takes too long &amp; makes it easier to beat the pitcher. The shortest distance from A to B is a straight line. Just make sure you hit the inside part of the bag &amp; stay in fair territory to avoid a collision. #STdrills https://t.co/VOOvlBoR8E
Games are decided by 1 run all the time. This can make or break an entire season. Many times, that run difference comes from a pitcher either making or missing a play. Take this part of your game seriously. #STdrills  https://t.co/Czia5u6jxM
@TheRealSalami The baseball isn‚Äôt altered at all if it hits one. Catchers aren‚Äôt affected by it one bit.
Receiving well is so important. Besides being a great target for the pitcher, a solid receiver also ‚Äúpresents‚Äù the pitches to the umpire for optimal views. A great receiver can make balls seem like strikes more than you‚Äôd think. #STdrills https://t.co/gmqKEd170c
Sometimes, it‚Äôs mechanics. Other times, it‚Äôs focus. Too many young pitchers focus on the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù when they should really be focusing on the ‚Äúdoorknob.‚Äù Don‚Äôt lose sight of the importance of visualization, focal points, and intent.
@Saw_Ville35 @theaceofspaeder It helps because it‚Äôs all about a focal point. If you don‚Äôt have strings you can try getting your son to choose a target &amp; focal point that‚Äôs lower than what he normally would do. Too often kids focus on the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù when they need to be focusing on the ‚Äúdoorknob‚Äù
@Saw_Ville35 @theaceofspaeder That‚Äôs right. Condition yourself to throw the ball down. Visualize it. Great tool. Really works.
A team isn‚Äôt a team with even a single selfish player. A team becomes a team when everyone thinks of others before themselves.
@LucasBiespiel @theaceofspaeder There‚Äôs enough weight and velo of baseball to do nothing more than strum them like a guitar string. Doesn‚Äôt affect flight of ball at all.
@NatsuDeez @drivelinebases Nothing is wrong with technology but many don‚Äôt have access to it. Why tag Kyle? He knows me and where I stand. Love that guy. Amazed by what he‚Äôs done &amp; thankful for his MANY contributions to this game.
Strings. A simple tool to promote a simple idea. Throw the ball down in the zone over and over and over. You don‚Äôt need fancy computers, elaborate materials, or anything else. If you want to improve, sometimes all you need are a few household materials. #STdrills https://t.co/W1lKPCau7d
‚ÄúHitting off a tee is for little kids. Pros don‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt believe my coach is making me do this boring stuff. I just want to hit homers!‚Äù #STdrills https://t.co/3TTRru1CP9
Read this. Then, read it again. The value of first pitch strikes cannot be overstated. The percentages are there. This is not something your coach just says to sound smart. If we can focus on this &amp; take it to heart BIG things will happen.   https://t.co/dTLUOUqYf6  @JWonCATCHING
Timing is everything in this game. It revolves around your body &amp; the pitcher‚Äôs delivery. Just as pitchers have a balance point to reach, hitters have a load. Pros are focusing on the same thing you are. Work on it. #STdrills https://t.co/gsNSesToIg
Just putting on the gear and squatting down behind the plate doesn‚Äôt make you a catcher. The pitcher plays an important role in keeping guys off bases, but the catcher plays an important role in not letting them advance. The battery can win games.

Truly heartbreaking news out of Florida today. Thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by this tragedy. Hug your loved ones a little tighter &amp; make sure you let them know how much they mean to you.
There are winning players and losing players on each team. The interesting part is that there are winning players that are less talented &amp; losing players that are more talented. Talent matters to a point, but character, determination, &amp; grit are a recipe for longevity.

Simply put: to be successful, everyone on your team must have the same vision &amp; be moving in the same direction. People on your team may be giving the advantage to the opponent simply by their actions, their negativity, and their inability to buy in.
A building is measured by its height, but without the foundation, nothing else would be able to stand. We often forget that building a foundation first is necessary for solid growth. Trust the process, take your time, &amp; remember that slow &amp; steady wins over fast &amp; reckless.
Your words may say one thing, but your actions may say something else altogether. Strive to make them the same. When you do, you‚Äôll flourish. #integrity
Somehow I don‚Äôt think @DaveRamsey agrees with their choice here.   https://t.co/mUzjqk9uJZ
If you want to improve, you‚Äôve got to face adversity head on. Running from it, hiding from it, &amp; being protected from it do not help. No one wishes it on anyone, it‚Äôs not fun, &amp; it‚Äôs rarely expected. However, when it comes, take each moment as a lesson.
Far too often, athletes become quickly discouraged that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have the same skillset as that person‚Äù or they ‚Äúwill never be able to do what they did.‚Äù The truth of the matter is that whether we‚Äôre a starter or the last one on the bench, we‚Äôve made the team for a reason.
@simoncholland Probably not where you expected that thread to go...
@simoncholland Or he was teaching his parents patience.
@simoncholland In his defense, maybe never. He can do all things.
Take pride in whatever it is that you do. From the smallest detail to the largest project, all things should be done with pride &amp; to the best of your abilities. Who you are is determined in part by how you are when no one is looking. Excellence is built from daily determination.
If you want to change the culture of your organization, start with one person. That changed person will change someone, and that changed person will change someone. Before you realize it, an entire group is changed because you invested in one.

Never lose sight of the fact that the words you say will be a main factor in how you‚Äôre remembered. We have the opportunity to change lives every day with positivity, faith, and hope ... yet all we can muster are petty complaints &amp; negativity about every situation. Let‚Äôs improve.
@ZGrimmig15 Thanks dude. Appreciate that.
@ZGrimmig15 I know how many followers I have, but none of the other stuff. The struggle for me isn‚Äôt striving for a number (though it used to be) ‚Äî my struggle is remembering that it‚Äôs not the size of your platform that determines how influential you are. So I try not to focus on it.
We‚Äôve all hopped on social media solely focused on the number of followers. Rather than worrying about how many follow us, let‚Äôs worry about making sure the content we share with even just one has the ability to transform &amp; impact lives.
If it ever becomes a grind, it‚Äôs time to find something else to do.
A team is only as good as the weakest link. A lot of times, the weakest link is a term given to an athlete for how they are as a teammate &amp; has very little to do with on field play. A team can overcome physical mistakes easier than having bad teammates around them daily.
A good coach is there to remind us of our purpose, help us recall information, &amp; to realign us when things go wrong. Whether a starter or the last one off the bench, each athlete brings something to the team. Replenish them rather than ripping them apart.
The best coaches dig deep within themselves &amp; share their hardest experiences in life. Leaders know that the struggles they walked through &amp; overcame in the past can help those struggling right now.
Baseball and summertime. Not even close. https://t.co/MeQGwIsnbw

5 Steps to becoming a better on-field leader:  1) never forget how hard it was to play the game.   2) remember that each athlete is an individual.   3) coach from your experience with failure, not just success.   4) love before you lead.   5) coaching is a platform, not a stage.

If you don't exactly know where you're going &amp; you don't have clear vision &amp; a GPS, there's a good chance you won't make it there. The same goes for our dreams &amp; goals. A clear vision is essential and a road map (discipline, a plan, work ethic) is necessary.
@JonAcuff not your finest wine, Jon.
In a time where everyone wants instant results, we have to remind ourselves that greatness is produced over time. Success is built upon a day by day process of discipline and hard work. People may not understand. You may stand out. However, it works and it'll be worth it.
It‚Äôs important to remember that where you fit on a team has some to do with what you do on the field, but a lot to do with how you are off it. Be a good teammate, contribute to the team, &amp; strive to make those around you better because you‚Äôre there.

Knowing your role is critical to a team‚Äôs success. The thing about a TEAM is that everyone‚Äôs role ... no matter how big or how small ... is important. Embracing it does not mean you‚Äôre not hungry for a bigger role. Your role will get bigger when the coach trusts you with less.
@PlayersTribune @PatrikLaine29 So is poutine
The best way to show your coach you care is by showing up every day &amp; striving to be the best you can be while always working to  improve. Anyone can show up &amp; go through the motions. It‚Äôs those who actually decide to self-evaluate &amp; constructively criticize that will see change.
@Decker6 What part of Atlanta will you be in?
A fast track to failure is thinking you've "made it." We can always learn, always grow, always mature, always improve. When you stay put and say "I've made it" someone else is getting up and saying "I want it." Don't get passed by because of pride. Humble yourself &amp; keep working.
It‚Äôs not always WHAT you say, but HOW you say it. As leaders, we can deliver the right words in the wrong tone or context &amp; they carry zero weight. Awareness &amp; feel are huge.
The @Eagles head coach was a high school football coach 10 years ago. If you have a passion &amp; a dream, keep on going. It doesn‚Äôt matter where you are right now. If you‚Äôre good at it, keep improving, and love what you do ‚Äî that‚Äôll shine through. Never say never. #FlyEaglesFly

We make progress every day when we keep learning. Those who stop making progress or become stuck are those who refuse to learn or think they know it all. The best in the game learn until they retire. If you call it a passion &amp; calling, you should strongly desire to learn daily.

Inventory is important when organizing anything in your life. The same goes for your team &amp; organization. Understanding what you have, what you need, and what you lack is essential to success now &amp; down the road.

The best way to diminish the fear of failure is to realize that you will fail. The greatest achievements in life have been accomplished by people who failed many more times than they succeeded. Learn perseverance &amp; practice determination every single day.
What you do &amp; how you act speak louder than any words you will ever say. Be intentional with your actions. Even if they aren‚Äôt listening, they‚Äôre watching.
Welcome to the @FMRedHawks, Carlos Triunfel! Carlos is a former #MLB player for both the #Mariners and the #Dodgers. We‚Äôre excited for him to be joining us this season!  Read more: https://t.co/aO0X7uaXyF https://t.co/IGy3bvu6bT
@Rene_Taubensee True. Can‚Äôt argue that.
A rodent saw its shadow this morning ... and it still has absolutely nothing to do with the weather. #GroundhogDay2018
Good culture is built from the ground. It‚Äôs a grassroots effort that starts with the coach, spreads from those who have been influenced, &amp; continues as people realize that our true motivation is to help others. If you want to change the culture of a group, start with one person.
When things don‚Äôt go your way, the best thing you can exhibit is accountability. Don‚Äôt make excuses, make a plan. Figure out what went wrong, what you can improve on, &amp; how to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. Coaches don‚Äôt expect perfection but they don‚Äôt expect excuses either.
So, what do you do as a coach?  https://t.co/C2jT24jK9a
The majority of athletes say they want to get better, say they want to improve, &amp; talk all about their future &amp; dreams. However, when the time comes, they don‚Äôt want to actually work for it. Dreams without work rarely become a reality.
The best part about February is that baseball is played this month. We won't have another month without baseball until November!
I know @MAppel26 personally, and I‚Äôm serious when I tell you that he‚Äôs one of the best people I‚Äôve ever met in my life. Proud of you, Mark. Whatever is next is exciting &amp; full of opportunity. https://t.co/xbBohtpyd8
It‚Äôs a new month, which means a clean slate. Move into this month having learned from ... not dwelling on ... whatever happened in the past. Fresh starts are the best way to reset, restart, and refresh your thinking &amp; move ahead more wisely.
Coaches &amp; recruiters at the next level look at what type of player AND what type of person you are. Think before you send on social media.
Reflecting back to my evening with @fargo_post2 baseball. I was honored and humbled to be a part of the evening as keynote speaker. The people of Fargo-Moorhead are among the greatest I‚Äôve met in my life. Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts with you. https://t.co/3bpkqJsTlO
Excellence is born through daily drive &amp; determination. Never think that you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt simply because of where you‚Äôve been, what you did, or who you are. Those who achieve greatness started somewhere.
Achievements are good. Winning is nice. Championships are great. But, what matters most isn‚Äôt how much you acquired, how many times you won, or the number of championships you earned. What matters most is whether or not you positively impacted those in your sphere of influence.
Each of us have a platform. Every day that we wake up &amp; walk out of our door, we have the ability to influence someone. You don‚Äôt need a stage, a mic, thousands of followers, etc. Those who influence many began by influencing one. Never lose sight of that.
Karl is the best. So happy he‚Äôs a part of the @FMRedHawks family. Getting to work with people like him makes me really proud to be a part of this team &amp; organization. https://t.co/6RJvLcrI2m
@distemic @urbantoadmedia @FMRedHawks Hahaha truth
There is no room for excuses and excellence to exist in the same space. Coaches can't expect perfection, but they can expect excellence. Realizing what you need to work on, figuring out how to overcome it, and sticking with it until it's fixed is the quickest way to excellence.
@trunner01 -22 currently.
Fair enough. https://t.co/fqTfEoyI9Y
Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight @fargo_post2 baseball. I was honored &amp; humbled to be asked &amp; it means the world to be a small part of your community.

What you dream of, what you aspire to, what you wish for, will never ever be simply handed to you. Those who achieve greatness get up, get moving, &amp; get after it. Change your mindset from ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let it happen‚Äù to a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it happen.‚Äù
@JordanBWilliams  https://t.co/09jAc0G1Ga
If you truly want to achieve something great, you can‚Äôt just show up &amp; wait for it to fall into your lap. Excellence is born through daily drive &amp; determination. I've learned there truly are no overnight success stories. Everyone who achieved something great started somewhere.
Everyone comes from different backgrounds, but hard work, dedication &amp; love for the game can take you further than you ever imagined possible. https://t.co/AsAKjQgkqv
Congratulations @RealCJ10 on your induction into the @mlb hall of fame. I grew up watching you join the @Braves &amp; become one of the greatest to ever play. Thanks for all the memories.
I‚Äôm the keynote speaker at the Fargo Post 2 HOF Banquet. Honored to be asked &amp; thankful to have the opportunity. See everyone there! https://t.co/Pbc8fTr7Px
Attitude is contagious. A good one can lift others up, carry others on, and help others through. A bad one can really damage progress &amp; productivity. For the sake of your team, lose the bad attitude. Lose the negativity. Choose to find the silver lining &amp; work to help others.
As base runners, pay attention. Keep your eyes up. Watch the tendencies of the catcher. Stay alert. One extra base can be the difference in an entire season!  https://t.co/NvwUOuZBxH
Young athletes live in a culture that says, "fit in, be perfect, get famous, look at me," &amp; thousands of other pressure filled things. The last thing they need is to show up to our game or practice &amp; have that amplified on them by us. Coaches should show them what truly matters.
As a coach, you may only have an athlete for a short time, but your impact can be generational. These athletes are going to become parents, workers, &amp; members of society. They‚Äôll leave a legacy that‚Äôs often rooted in the way you treated them.
@KeithTVGuy  https://t.co/YgrBJLejEE
One of the biggest mistakes we can make is thinking we‚Äôve learned it all or that someone can‚Äôt teach us anything. We can learn from anyone - because everyone has a story.

The success you experience under the bright lights is a direct reflection of the work you put in away from them. The true measure of character isn't how you work when everyone is watching. Your character is determined, measured, &amp; gauged off the work you do when NOBODY is around.
The best way to light a fire under your team/organization is to have a group of people all pulling on the same side of the rope. The same vision, goals, &amp; direction are pivotal for success. Recognize where this is lacking in your group &amp; work to rectify it as quickly as possible.
. @JOEL9ONE is the definition of servant leader. This kind of stuff is rare.  https://t.co/FmRdwb1GhT
Want to be the best teammate you can be? Think of them before you think of yourself.
We show up every day and work on the physical components of the game, forgetting that so much of the edge we can gain comes from the mental side. Just like we go to the gym to strengthen our bodies we must begin to train &amp; work our minds to be ready for the long season ahead.
I‚Äôve personally seen careers end over things that didn‚Äôt even happen on the field. Take care of your business on the field &amp; take care of yourself off it. Don‚Äôt allow one bad choice to ruin what you‚Äôve been working towards your entire life.
Coconut oil works better than Crisco. #FlyEaglesFly
Our heroes, the ones we admire, the ones who have reached the top, have done so from daily discipline and hard work. Becoming great is a process that takes time. That's why so few reach greatness. Start now, develop a plan, create clarity, set goals, &amp; trust the process.
It‚Äôs ok, folks. @FMRedHawks baseball is coming. Hold. On. Just. A. Bit. Longer. #skol
Day after day, we set big goals &amp; dream big dreams. Everything seems attainable when the road is flat &amp; smooth. However, at the first sign of a curve, a bump, or a roadblock, we begin to lose heart &amp; consider turning around. Don't. Tough times are strengthening you. Keep going.
I've watched people with great talent rise to the top solely based on their talent. However, their stay at the top was short. I've watched people with average talent rise to the top &amp; stay there based on their work ethic. There is lots of talent in the world but few hard workers.
Anything worthwhile will have speed bumps &amp; setbacks. The pivotal moment &amp; turning point of our life is how we react to those moments. There will be people with you who are critical &amp; there will be those who are encouraging. Choose wisely who gets to walk with you on the journey.
When the shouts of critical voices drown out the whispers of truth, remind yourself of your strengths, your blessings, and your abilities. The best way to silence the shouts of critics is to do that which they said you could never do.
@TraeMcGill @lokationnation @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics It‚Äôs like learning to drive &amp; see the road ahead before flooring it. Navigate &amp; learn to maneuver before driving at full speed (or faster)
@xanbarksdale Look good play good stops in high school. Those who decide if you play at the next level or not could care less how good you look. Doesn‚Äôt matter how good you look or how many accessories you have if you make errors.
@JLBish17 Learn what‚Äôs working for you that day &amp; to not panic. In game adjustments separates the average from the great. That quality alone can get you to the next level above someone else.
@KeithMadison32 Criticizing a coach in the presence of a child is bad on many levels. The one that stands out to me is that parents are teaching the child to disrespect authority. Bad life skill right there.
@CoachPerk @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @lokationnation @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics @jimlawler1 Mechanics are not universal. There are tendencies that have to be present in order for the body to do what it needs to do, but developing efficient, repeatable, ‚Äúgood for you/your body‚Äù movements should be what we strive for. Let‚Äôs eliminate these ‚Äúcookie cutter‚Äù coaches/pitchers
@KeithMadison32 Belief comes from consistently seeing that hard work produces results. ‚ÄúIf I do this, the result is that‚Äù snowballs over time into confidence each day.
@lokationnation @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics If a coach says ‚Äúmy way will prevent overuse‚Äù or ‚Äúmy plan prevents fatigue‚Äù then their ego is way too big. Fatigue can be from many factors and overuse can be from many years. Often we can only monitor and react ... not prevent.
@bomar19 @Bazbol @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @lokationnation @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics We must look at how they‚Äôre performing in game. Know your pitcher &amp; watch for signs of fatigue. Overuse may look like a drop in velo or it may look like a lack of command. Could be immediately or after a certain number of pitches. Overuse may be from years prior too.
@Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @lokationnation @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics The simplest reason is that our pitchers need some sort of recovery for the long haul of the season. However, it must be case by case. I have pitchers that lose feel if they don‚Äôt touch a ball (or a mound) every day. This includes off days. Not everyone is this way though.
Coaches instill fear in players &amp; make them afraid to take risks. They show up daily trying to be safe &amp; avoid your melt down. Then, when the time comes, you wonder why they won't play hard, maximize potential, &amp; give you full respect. That is earned over time by leading in love.
If you're not taking every rep seriously, you're not dedicated enough to play at the next level. Every rep..every play..every day..counts.
Pudge talking about his catching mechanics is a must listen if you want to improve. The pitcher has to do their part, but a mechanically sound catcher can be the difference in that one run game win/loss.  https://t.co/JgptVOhyhv

Something I‚Äôve learned about myself in 2018: I can do some serious damage at pizza buffets.
When your life is over, the stats, the fame, the money, the stuff ‚Ä¶ none of it will matter and that‚Äôs not how you‚Äôll be remembered. Your legacy lies in who you are as a person, how you impacted those who came after you, and the mark you left on the world.
We want to have purpose, make a difference, &amp; change lives. To find purpose, to make an impact, &amp; to help others means we must first walk into ... come through ... and learn from adversity. Experience is the best teacher. Embrace it &amp; keep your focus on the right things.
Congratulations to @FMRedHawksGM on being named the new @AA_Baseball Executive Director. 22 years working for the @FMRedHawks is truly amazing in today‚Äôs baseball world. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate all you‚Äôve done! Best of luck!  https://t.co/hcPoba662n

@aaron_watson Stop by the @FMRedHawks office today &amp; we‚Äôll get you a hat to wear on stage tonight!! Fargo folks love their #fmredhawks! Hope you‚Äôre well man!
Body language speaks louder than any of your words ever will. Your body language tells the opponent, your teammates, and your coaches exactly how you're feeling. Playing at the next level means being a well rounded athlete. This includes ability AND attitude on the field.
When it comes down to game time, the coach will rely on who they believe will give them the best chance to be successful. It doesn‚Äôt matter how big you are, what you did in the past, or what others say about you. If you get it done you get in the game.
You may know a lot, but if you can‚Äôt communicate to those you‚Äôre leading it‚Äôs not worth anything. Communication is an essential part of leadership because it allows the message to be delivered in such a way, when done right, that informs, motivates, &amp; unites. Words are powerful.
I am honored to be the keynote speaker for this year‚Äôs @fargo_post2 HOF Banquet on 1/28. Looking forward to a great night! Hope to see you there! https://t.co/RFwkzv8AaY
I was told numerous times that I needed to be more realistic with my plan &amp; dreams. Now, 14 years in professional baseball. Dream big, work hard, and have faith. https://t.co/HrPYrP0Zfj
Never ever give up. Everything may seem hopeless, everyone may count you out, everybody may think it‚Äôs not worth it. Keep going til the very end. Fight with all you have. Believe with every ounce of you being. Anything could happen.
Wow. #MinnesotaMiracle! https://t.co/5HlWefR7cl
You won‚Äôt win unless you work. The result is reaped during the summer but the foundation is laid during the winter. You can say all you want, but what you do (or don‚Äôt do) will speak the loudest.
Nothing that stands the test of time &amp; endures the test of adversity is created overnight. Strength is born from resistance &amp; endurance is born from overcoming adversity &amp; pushing past that which is difficult. Start today &amp; begin the process.
@penprase33 I get these ideas for the general topic of the tweet from things I‚Äôve seen, or while I‚Äôm coaching here in the off season. Stories I‚Äôve heard, experiences, etc. Then I just write it down. I guess that‚Äôs how my brain works, don‚Äôt know. Hope you‚Äôre well man. Enjoying your content!
@SealBeachEd I do. @FMRedHawks. Thanks very much! Means a lot.
Most of the world goes through life doing nothing more than status quo every single day. Doing even a little bit more than is required of you will cause you to stand out big time, regardless of what you do.
Congratulations to one of the @FMRedHawks play by play guys, @BradA_Pbp on being named North Dakota Sportscaster of the Year! A great talent, and an even better person! Happy for you!
Congratulations to @inforum sports writer @FargoBigE on being named the North Dakota Sportswriter of the Year! He‚Äôs a tremendous asset to the community and his coverage of the @FMRedHawks is always classy &amp; detailed. Proud of you, E!
What you believe is what you become.
Be kind, humble, and respectful to all people you meet along the way. You never know when one of them will be pivotal to your next step. People often remember &amp; seldom forget how you treated them.
Going through the motions does no one any good. If you're going to show up, give your best. Otherwise you're only hurting yourself &amp; the team.
Fear and faith cannot exist in the same space. In all that you do, believe. Trust your abilities. Trust your hard work. Trust the process.
It might be early. It might be cold. It might be a sacrifice. It takes going the extra mile to be a champion. Work hard now, &amp; win later.
Lace up those cleats, put on that uniform, and run on to that field with the passion, heart, grit, determination, and love of someone who doesn't know what tomorrow brings. There will be a day that it's the last day you ever get to wear that uniform. Don't take it for granted.
Winning is necessary &amp; important. But, winning doesn‚Äôt happen without a plan, purpose, intent, &amp; a team that begins as individuals &amp; ends as family. If you show up &amp; hope to win, you never will. Trust the process &amp; navigate the path necessary to win.

I would like to give a huge thanks to the @KMHSathletics baseball team &amp; @mikelinch for having me out to speak tonight! Had a blast! Good luck this season!
Wow. Just wow. What a moment. Thanks to the @FMRedHawks I am an adopted MN sports fan. Love it! #skol https://t.co/kXd3GM6g8W
Every day, give thanks for wearing that uniform. Also, every day that you go out into the community, you should represent yourself with class, dignity, &amp; respect for the community you live in, the people that made this possible for you, and the uniform you‚Äôre so blessed to wear.
Excited to speak to the @KMHSathletics baseball team tonight with @mikelinch. Looking forward to a fun evening!
Bless because you‚Äôve been blessed. Teach because you were taught. When we go through something, it‚Äôs easy to retreat. The world would change if we could take a step out of our situation to realize that we may be going through it so that we can help someone else through it later.
So much that we do OFF the field translates to success ON the field. Don't underestimate the power of early work, conditioning, weights, nutrition, &amp; rest, etc. We simply can‚Äôt just show up and expect excellence. It must be developed, built, &amp; sustained. Start. Right. Now.
Pitchers:  ‚Ä¢ The most important pitch in baseball isn't a 100 mph fastball or a knee buckling curve. It's strike one. Never downplay the power of getting ahead in the count. All you have to do is look at the opponent batting average when 0-1 versus 1-0. It‚Äôs astounding.
Being a team player means sacrificing your own numbers for the good of the team. Be selfless. Bunt, hit a sac fly, or move a runner over.   We &gt; Me
Thank you, @06BaseballMag (@gdcbaseball) for the opportunity to speak to the Georgia HS baseball coaches. Thankful for the opportunity &amp; encouraged by the amount of coaches who truly are hungry to learn all they can. Best of luck this season to everyone!
Too many kids get too much negative pressure from their parents when they leave you. Often, the most amount of positivity, love, &amp; encouragement they get in the entire week is from you. Coaches have an incredible platform that gives them the opportunity to change lives.
When you coach an athlete they may only wear your uniform for a short time. However, the impact you have is generational. These athletes will go out into the world, become parents, spouses, and friends. We have a chance to change family trees forever. Don't take that for granted.
If you think practice, fundamentals, hitting off a tee, bullpens, etc. are "a waste of time" I invite you to go check out a MLB Spring Training. You will see the best players in the world working hard daily to master the little things. Why? Doing the little things wins big games.
Mistakes happen. Don't fret. Perfection is unattainable. Take a deep breath and realize that often what matters most is how quickly you adjust &amp; correct the mistake.
People want to follow someone who has:  1) Integrity 2) A clear vision 3) Steady emotions 4) Empathy 5) Unshakable faith 6) Relentless optimism
Thanks to @gdcbaseball for having me today at the GA Baseball Coaches Clinic. Had a blast hanging with you guys &amp; speaking to you. Thankful for the opportunity.
Speaking this afternoon to all the high school baseball coaches in the state of Georgia. I‚Äôm honored, humbled, and excited. The topic today is creating a championship culture. Thanks, @gdcbaseball for this opportunity. See you soon!
Body language speaks louder than any words ever will. https://t.co/t1PWq2yECv
Culture is created by clarity. Have a vision &amp; let everyone else see it too. If we show up every day &amp; wander around aimlessly, tough times are on the horizon. Our team &amp; organization needs to know where we're going, but more importantly WHY they need to follow us there.
There are two types of criticism. One is crippling &amp; one is constructive. Leaders have the potential to shape the future of many people, but in order for that to happen there must be corrections &amp; criticism. Make sure it‚Äôs constructive. The truth, in love, is crucial for success.
Messing around and not taking practice seriously doesn't just affect you. Recognize the ripple effects of your actions. Be a team player.
Proud of you, @brandonmmann. The #Rangers are lucky to have you! #fmredhawks https://t.co/kdfhjSMXCn
If you want to make a difference in someone‚Äôs life, you have to actually get to know that person on a level that grants you permission to speak into their life. You can‚Äôt show up, speak up, &amp; expect them to listen. Love them before you lead them.
A leader who dismisses the thoughts or ideas of someone within the team or organization simply because they‚Äôre not as qualified or at the same level would make me question whether they‚Äôre even a leader at all. Being in charge, the coach, or the boss doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre a leader.

@jeanneparkcity @GullsClub Rarely does one just become great means you don‚Äôt just wake up one day and succeed at every single thing you do. It takes work &amp; progress. Nothing is handed to us.
@jeanneparkcity @GullsClub Lessons on the journey come from failure and success alike. When you overcome failure, you take strides. When you enjoy success, it keeps you going. Not a baseball lesson, a life lesson.
@jeanneparkcity @GullsClub Where did I mention baseball? Each person experiences ups and downs in whatever they do. Learning from shortcomings &amp; enjoying success is part of moving forward. It‚Äôs not being stuck in failure or gloating in success.
Really excited to connect with &amp; present to all the coaches this Friday at the @gdcbaseball clinic! We will be talking about building a championship culture. See y‚Äôall there!
There‚Äôs room for improvement every single day. Strive for greatness, but remember that rarely does one just become great. It‚Äôs a daily process that has its share of ups and downs. Take it one moment at a time. Give thanks for the success &amp; learn from the failures. Enjoy the ride.
The success or failure you‚Äôll have on the field months from now is a direct reflection of your work ethic today. Make every moment count.

Many leaders get criticized for saying "no" too often. The truth is, the best leaders understand how saying "no" to something good leaves the door open to say "yes" to something great. Never ever settle.

Failure &amp; shortcomings, when approached with the right mindset, are nothing more than stumbling blocks that you use as stepping stones. Learn from, don‚Äôt dwell on these things. So often we run away from adversity thinking it‚Äôs bad for us when really it may be the fuel we need.
Now, only the #SuperBowl stands in the way of us and baseball...

How many people that accomplished something great never would‚Äôve accomplished it had they let fear, anxiety, &amp; doubt win over their minds? My guess is close to zero. Accomplishing great things will have road blocks. Let the will to succeed be greater than the fear of failure.
Really excited to welcome @o19donnell to the @FMRedHawks family! Couldn‚Äôt be happier to have him on board. Patrick is coming off a record setting college career at @GoAugie &amp; also is a very high character individual! Welcome! #fmredhawks   https://t.co/2sSLOinapf
A coach has the opportunity to impact GENERATIONS! They may only wear your uniform a few short years at most, but the impact you can have on them is astounding. Keep perspective each day you interact with your team. These people will leave your team &amp; be shaped by your influence.
I‚Äôd like to introduce you to ballplayers all across the world who do that same thing. https://t.co/1OtOsxCWCJ
Excuses won‚Äôt exist in the same space as growth. Excuses are a crutch used to place blame &amp; ignore what we really need: improvement. If we‚Äôre honest with ourselves, excuses are simply our pride getting in the way of our progress. Champions don‚Äôt find excuses, they find a way.
Motion &amp; progress aren‚Äôt even close to the same thing. So many go through their days without a plan &amp; without purpose. We refer to this as ‚Äúgoing through the motions.‚Äù Progress involves knowing what, why, &amp; when. Every moment is a chance to improve &amp; move ahead more wisely.
Most athletes feel enormous amounts of pressure at home or from their peers. It‚Äôs the culture we live in. Perfection. Attention. Fame. Coaches who flash their ego any chance they get only enhance the problem. Before you can lead, you have to serve. Know your athletes &amp; help them.
Before you can make your athletes believe in themselves, they have to see you believe in yourself. A coach with confidence issues puts that on display for all to see. It‚Äôs like the airplane oxygen mask theory: put yours on before assisting others.
Likewise. Some of the best memories I have in the game. https://t.co/QIi5Dq9Fot
You can plan every practice perfectly, strategize each game flawlessly, &amp; know all you want about what you coach. But, I assure you, if you can‚Äôt communicate properly, none of that will matter. Learn to communicate with your staff, your players, &amp; yourself. It‚Äôs essential.
If you‚Äôve lost your passion for the game, a good starting point is to remember why you started playing the game in the first place. Much can be taken away from you, but your love for the sport isn't one of them. You may lose it, but it can -- and should -- be found.
We work out, train, run, prepare, &amp; plan for a season physically. How much work are we doing on the mental side? It‚Äôs understandable that the physical side needs to be in top shape, but if we‚Äôre not mentally prepared to compete then what‚Äôs the point?
Just like you wouldn‚Äôt follow someone who has zero idea where they‚Äôre going or why they‚Äôre even traveling, players won‚Äôt follow or listen to a coach with no vision or clear purpose for their team. Starting now, define your goals &amp; map out how you want to get there.
Teaching each player on your team the exact same way is what I refer to as "cookie cutter coaching." Remember, nobody is identical, and nobody learns the same way or at the same rate. The first step is to learn about each individual on your team.
@MarkAStrand @FMRedHawks Was the pitching coach from 2015-2017. Love Fargo. Excited to continue as manager in such a great place. My family is blessed to call Fargo our 2nd home.
@CoachTen23 @gdcbaseball Thanks Coach! Can‚Äôt wait!
One swing at a time, one pitch at a time, one inning at a time, one game at a time. We make things too complicated when we try to control too much on the field. Break it down into a series of ones. Focus &amp; be intentional with each &amp; every action you make. It‚Äôs a game changer.
Almost anyone can be given the title of coach. Few, however, will earn the title of leader. Coaches may show you how to get it done but leaders will come alongside you through it. Coaches teach in-game skills while leaders teach in-game skills that can be used in real life too.
Behind the scenes look at how I caught the attention of my wife back in high school: https://t.co/NWSRGtOsQ7
Playing baseball at the next level is not easy. If it was, anyone could play college ball or pro ball. Work hard to achieve your dreams. To achieve what only the top percent of people achieve you must do the little things correctly. Success is earned, not given.
The best leaders have a hand in everything the organization does &amp; of course, they call the final shots. However, delegating responsibility is huge. Not only does it help lessen the burden of work, it also gives those on your team a renewed sense of importance &amp; purpose.
Pitchers:  ‚Ä¢ Strike 1 is the best pitch in your arsenal. The higher your first pitch strike percentage, the higher your success rate will be.
A good baseball program is one that has a solid mission statement, clear goals, &amp; leadership that both guides &amp; motivates. Build it.
High school &amp; college baseball starts soon. What are you doing to prepare? The time is now to buckle up &amp; bear down.
I‚Äôm honored &amp; humbled, @KeithMadison32. Thank you. @ABCA1945 #ABCA2018 https://t.co/XXvSbSWTwl
Representing @NDSUfootball today! National Champions! Proud of y‚Äôall! https://t.co/rOn3zYpGv4
@THEcoltsedbrook Means a ton, man. We have an incredible platform doing what we do. Not many people can influence lives as directly as a coach. Huge blessing.
Coaches think legacy is in the number of championships they have or how many wins they have by their name. I believe a coach‚Äôs legacy is determined by how many lives they positively impact throughout their career. Keep focused on what TRULY matters &amp; you‚Äôll always be successful.
That‚Äôs awesome! Thanks for sharing. https://t.co/rlxLnLcgIl
Too many pitchers throw their 0-2 pitch 2-0 and their 2-0 pitch 0-2. It‚Äôs mostly a mindset. Think of pitching to contact off the barrel to catch up or get a quick out when you‚Äôre down 2-0. Ahead 0-2, hunt for the strikeout. Put them away.
The best thing we can have in sports is a short term memory. This doesn‚Äôt mean that we ignore what happened. It means, for a short time, we reflect, research, &amp; often relearn in order to not make the same mistakes again. From there, we move ahead wiser &amp; with more confidence.
To lead well:  1) Practice what you preach.  2) Lose the ego &amp; serve them.   3) Have clear vision.  4) Have unshakable faith.  5) Know each team member.  6) Build their trust in you.  7) Remember you were once in their shoes.  8) Have their back &amp; never show them up.  9) Believe.
Coaches would prefer a group that‚Äôs LESS talented but works hard every day, gives it all they‚Äôve got every time out &amp; acts like a family than a group that‚Äôs MORE talented yet selfish &amp; lazy. Guaranteed.
To all coaches attending #ABCA2018, soak up all you can. You can lose your job, your title, &amp; lots of other things. However, they can‚Äôt take your knowledge, instincts, and connections from you. Enjoy learning from the best. Don‚Äôt just listen, apply. @ABCA1945
Leaders are those people who walk in when all others are walking out. They don‚Äôt just tell you how to get through it, they are by your side through it. We should all strive to be that type of person. Life finds its meaning when you help others find their purpose.
If you show up &amp; give anything less than your best, you might as well go home. The path to success includes hard work, intent, determination, perseverance, faith, &amp; heart. Most of the world does exactly what‚Äôs expected. Stand out. Be different. Exceed expectations.

There‚Äôs a big difference between teams that have bonded off the field &amp; those who just show up &amp; go through the motions. Connecting your team personally means they play for each other before themselves. Your team quickly becomes a family. Set aside time to allow this to happen.

@xanbarksdale Or are blinded by this mix of denial/fake confidence to try &amp; push them through. We can tell in the pen ... sometimes just need that honest voice to remind us. Use. What. Works.
The best teams understand that whether you are the star or the last person that made the team, everyone plays an important role.   The best coaches understand that this isn‚Äôt a natural thing, so it needs to be taught, embraced, and cherished.
@chriscauley You can empathize with the crying baby now ... when you have a 10 year old I bet that won‚Äôt bother you either. https://t.co/EaaPYCpuSq

A few years ago, I took a trip to Puerto Rico with @UPIDiscipleship &amp; @TerryEvans17. We had a chance to spend some time with the Clemente family. I was blown away at their heart for others &amp; how they carried out Roberto‚Äôs legacy with such grace &amp; love. What a family.
Getting the most out of athletes is a top priority as a coach. However, if getting the most out of them means academically, personally, behaviorally, etc. I think you can consider it a success. Getting the most out of athletes doesn‚Äôt always mean on the field. Redefine success.
The great part about New Year‚Äôs Eve &amp; the celebration as the clock strikes 12 is that it signifies the turning of a page. A new start. A clean slate. It doesn‚Äôt matter where you‚Äôve been or what mistakes you made. Declaring a fresh start is freeing &amp; exhilarating. Happy New Year!
Want to make a difference? Be positive. The world needs more of it, but so do those closest to you. It‚Äôs contagious, it‚Äôs uplifting, and it works. Find the silver lining in every situation today, no matter how hard it is. I bet you‚Äôll feel better, more blessed, &amp; happier.
This was, without a doubt, the highlight of 2017. How can this be topped? https://t.co/ZCkga2E4jj
Pitchers must step on the mound with conviction, confidence, and control. Taking the ball, getting the sign, and saying ‚ÄúI hope this is the right pitch‚Äù will rarely work out. Have a plan, give each pitch a purpose, and pitch with passion.
One of the many benefits of building a positive, championship culture within your team or organization is that you'll have a team full of players who have short-term goals, long-term aspirations, and huge dreams.
As an athlete, when you finally step on a field with a "I know I can" attitude instead of a "I hope I can" attitude, everything will change.
@SportsCenter @TFStanton10  https://t.co/yPN5VbyLcw
@JonAcuff @jillian_schlact &amp; I share two gigs!! We have rollover usually too!
‚ÄúBecause I said so‚Äù is an easy way to spot a coach who is either caught up in the power the title brings or they actually have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. Coaching and teaching are the same. Don‚Äôt just say words, let them mean something &amp; teach something.
Coaches that forget how hard the game was to play are on a fast track to losing credibility &amp; trust with their team. No one likes to hear ‚Äúthrow strikes‚Äù or ‚Äújust hit the ball‚Äù or anything else like that. Perfection is unattainable. Excellence, however, can be demanded.
The first step towards finding your purpose in life is to help others find their purpose.
The baseball life is a crazy life. We stay up late &amp; sleep late. We travel anywhere &amp; everywhere. We pack our car &amp; move for months at a time just to pack up &amp; do it all over again. The memories we make &amp; the laughs we share will last a lifetime. So thankful for them, &amp; for this. https://t.co/KNaOOahK8m
Who you surround yourself with, who you associate with, and who you hang with are all little parts of how you‚Äôll be perceived. Make sure every day that you take a running inventory of whether those in your circle have your best interests in mind or not. Your future depends on it.

@Jasinjuh Yep.
@jasonhoates Could be fun, but also it‚Äôs necessary. As a coach I want players who want to learn regardless of fun. To a certain age it should absolutely be fun (to keep attention span &amp; to learn to love the game) Around HS age it gets real.
@Luke_Murton @jasonhoates Good point Luke. But you have 280 characters now so you don‚Äôt have to speak in code. That‚Äôs SO 2017.
So many athletes complain about practice. They complain about fundamentals. They complain about the weather. They complain about anything. Be different. Complaining gets you nowhere. Realize that practice is essential to success, fundamentals are foundational, &amp; positivity works.

The absolute last thing your athlete needs is to be criticized after a game. A bad performance doesn't mean they're a bad person. What they need most from you is love, acceptance, and someone to remind them that what they do IS NOT who they are.
It's almost 11 pm and I'm wandering aimlessly around my house because I have to reach my goal. #Fitbit
If you call it a grind, I would venture to say you don‚Äôt love what you‚Äôre doing. Waking up every day &amp; finding joy, purpose, &amp; pleasure in what you do should never ever cause you to refer to it as a grind.
Being a leader on the field doesn‚Äôt always mean you‚Äôre the loudest or the most vocal. Often, leading is by example. In this case, no words need to be spoken.

@jonbarth11 Amen. Also a very good point.
Fear on the field is a product of feeling unprepared or thinking you're unqualified. Confidence is born from preparation, hard work, and believing that you're better than the opponent.
Players need accountability from their teammates, information from their coaches, &amp; love from their families. This is the beginning recipe for success on and off the field.
Highly highly recommend you join us! Don‚Äôt miss out! https://t.co/g7PW52PeYZ
Every time you step on a field you‚Äôre representing yourself, your family, your coach, &amp; your team. The quickest way to lose an opportunity to play ‚Äî or to be on the team ‚Äî is to act in a way that damages those things. Remember that if you want to be a pro you should act like one.

Discipline is formed and character is forged through adversity. Most people have been told that it's better to run from adversity than it is to embrace it. The truth is that when we run from adversity, we're never refined from it. Growth happens when there are setbacks.

We all have a platform. Some have baseball fields &amp; a team. Some have a child at home, but all of us have someone looking to us. No platform is too big or too small to lead. The heart of a leader has a heart for each person under their guidance. Don't take that for granted.
The people who pushed through adversity and overcame obstacles are the ones who developed an unmatched strength &amp; unrelenting determination. They stand out. Don‚Äôt shy away from that which scares you. Face it head on.

Strive to build a program that focuses on developing great people &amp; great athletes. Championships are great but they‚Äôre also temporary. Molding high quality individuals that impact the world &amp; those around them in a positive way should be the focus. The rest is icing on the cake.
Talent takes you to a certain point, but even talent has a ceiling. Those who continue to improve &amp; move up the ladder are the ones who understand that it's earned, not given. Work ethic, character, grit, &amp; heart aren't put on your baseball card, but they're essential to success.
A team with a championship mindset is full of athletes who think of teammates before themselves. They have grit, determination, &amp; perseverance. They show up every day with confidence, knowing that they‚Äôve put the work in &amp; that results are a product of the process.
We‚Äôre not that different after all! https://t.co/WqWHNi983U

WINNING happens under the bright lights but WINNERS happen away from the bright lights. The foundation of all success is hard work, planning, learning, &amp; perseverance. These things happen long before you put that uniform on &amp; step onto the field. Show &amp; go success doesn't exist.
A championship culture is the result of a day to day commitment to be the absolute best in absolutely every way. Excellence is contagious. Spread it around.
Some days feel just like this. https://t.co/JHs8SLZJfk
Most authority figures (coaches, teachers, parents) will stay on you &amp; push you to be the best you can be. They‚Äôre not doing this to upset you, they‚Äôre doing it to get the most out of you. Those who have walked your path &amp; fought your battles can share wisdom for your journey.

Your coach isn‚Äôt expecting perfection each time out. They are, however, expecting accountability, hard work, &amp; an eagerness to improve on whatever it is that‚Äôs holding you back. Make improvements, not excuses.
A uniform, playing time, &amp; reputation are things that must be earned over time. The thing you must remember about these three is that one bad decision can take all of them away. Don‚Äôt lose in a second what‚Äôs taken you years to earn.
I told myself when I retired from playing in August of 2014 that I was going to take a year off from working out/running. That turned into 3. I just downloaded couch to 5K. Figured it‚Äôs as good a time as any to get back in shape. It‚Äôs never too late &amp; you‚Äôre never too far gone.
We rarely learn when we're experiencing success. The reason is because we just cruise along &amp; never think twice. When failures comes into our lives, it causes us to pause, reflect, &amp; think about how to correct the issues that cause it. Bottom line: failure is a great teacher.

When you wake up, make sure you set clearly before you both vision and purpose for your day. We rarely go into the unknown without a GPS. The same goes for your day. Know exactly what you want before your feet hit the ground for maximum efficiency &amp; confidence moving forward.
Too many parents put their unrealistic expectations &amp; unrealized dreams on their kids. It‚Äôs unfair &amp; sets them up for undue pressure. Sports can teach amazing life lessons if you‚Äôll allow them to.
@Minceymp If you can look yourself in the mirror over the course of a week &amp; say with complete certainty that you can retire ‚Äî with zero regrets or doubts ‚Äî you may be ready. Never make an emotional decision. Pray, think, ponder, pray, &amp; then decide. Emotions cause rash decisions.
@bschu7 @FMRedHawks I‚Äôm pumped too!!!
Talent takes you there, work ethic keeps you there. Never settle for, ‚ÄúI made it.‚Äù Strive for improvement daily.
@DomIzzoWDAY I live about 5 minutes from Kennesaw State. Maybe I should come up to Fargo if they play. I‚Äôll just rep my @FMRedHawks gear to stay somewhat neutral.
Rather than complaining about each &amp; every situation, remember there are people &amp; places all across the world that have WAY less than you and me. Give thanks &amp; give back.
Allowing the emotion of defeat to teach a lesson is part of the growing up process. Too many try and protect their athletes from that. Winning and losing is part of the game &amp; part of life. Better to learn how to handle it earlier than later.
It‚Äôs best to leave critiquing and coaching to the coach. When your kid leaves the game, maybe try saying, ‚ÄúI love watching you play‚Äù or ‚Äúenjoyed seeing you out there today.‚Äù Piling on criticism isn‚Äôt the way to go. Sometimes, caring means letting them learn from someone else.
You can COACH without actually knowing your players, but you‚Äôll never be able to LEAD them until you‚Äôve learned their story. Remember, coach is just a title. Leader is a quality &amp; description.
Just like you wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone who seems fake &amp; doesn‚Äôt have your best interests in mind, nor will your athletes. The best way to truly lead is to be completely authentic. Athletes are craving someone who they KNOW has their back .... win or lose.
Setbacks are a setup for a comeback. God is using EVERYTHING for good. Stand firm in your faith today.   #SpiritualCaffeine https://t.co/3mAo2MXdWw
You CANNOT want it more than your kid if you‚Äôre the parent of an athlete. At some point, they‚Äôll either get burned out or grow to hate the sport you want them to love if you force it. Instead of shoving them towards your sport, support them in their sport, whatever it may be.
@JasonRomano Christmas Shoes
@chriscauley @JasonRomano Simply. Having. A wonderful Christmastime.
As a coach, screaming at players isn‚Äôt going to make them want to work harder, play better, or show up to the field for that matter. Each athlete has an individual personality. Therefore, it‚Äôs wise to actually get to know them to know how to motivate them.
This is really encouraging today. You don‚Äôt have to be what ‚Äúthey‚Äù want you to be to be used by God.   #SpiritualCaffeine https://t.co/WeOk7rl7GX
What an amazing week at @The_Increase Conference in San Antonio! So thankful @jillian_schlact and I were there. Thanks to everyone who made it possible!   @Sports_Spectrum @PAOtoday @_OneCoach_ @IJM @NPInsideOut @EddieTaubensee @Rene_Taubensee @GaryMo @stevestenstrom @JasonRomano
Always the best. https://t.co/un2wmiNfSa
Fear is an emotion that shows up when you feel unprepared, unqualified, or undeserving. Counter fear by working hard, learning a lot, and having confidence in your abilities. Eliminating fear is truly freeing.
The deciding factor between a team that rises to the occasion or doesn‚Äôt is one word: grit.   How you &amp; the team handle adversity will make all the difference in the outcome of the season. Let it drive you, don‚Äôt let it defeat you.
‚ÄúIf your visions and dreams don‚Äôt involve making others better, you need bigger and bolder visions &amp; dreams.‚Äù  {@JonGordon11}
I highly recommend you all to follow @Sports_Spectrum. Athletes &amp; people in sports are sharing their stories that I guarantee you won‚Äôt see anywhere else.
Work ethic &amp; character is something that is often born in times of failure. Hiding, preventing, or protecting people from failure doesn‚Äôt allow them to develop the right things necessary to combat what life will throw at them. Enjoy success &amp; learn from failure.
A sad reality in youth sports is that so often the parent wants it way more than the athlete. What ends up happening 9/10 times is the kid ends up resenting the sport &amp; quitting or resenting the parent. Kids will work harder &amp; have more fun doing something they want to do.
Those who are successful at what they do were never forced to work hard or told to get going. There is an inner burning desire to work, improve, &amp; keep moving ahead. Adversity &amp; triumph mix together to fuel them on their way.
Few people can relate &amp; resonate with your successes. Many can relate &amp; resonate with your failures. Being vulnerable &amp; leading from humility goes a long way when connecting with others. Nobody is perfect. Expecting perfection does nothing but cause unnecessarily pressure.
A coach will help you learn how to get through it. A leader will walk with you through it. The world needs more leaders.
@JonGordon11 @DavidtheAdmiral @c3hoosier Looking forward to meeting you this week at @The_Increase. Thanks for sharing some of your time with us.
Any time I‚Äôm in Texas I go to @rudysbbq. The best part is seeing other people like @JasonRomano, @brandoncoker, &amp; @chriscauley share my passion of good bbq. Glad we‚Äôre on the same page, boys.
The difference between average &amp; great isn't always talent level. Some of the most average players succeed because of extraordinary work ethic &amp; strong character.
With the right mindset, a loss is nothing more than a chance to regroup &amp; move ahead more wisely. You will always learn more from adversity than you will smooth sailing. Embrace it. Use it. Be motivated by it.

People are going to see who you really are &amp; your character will become exposed when times are tough. Anyone can act tough &amp; be positive when things are going well. It‚Äôs the times when we struggle &amp; all hope seems lost that we show the world .. &amp; ourselves .. what we‚Äôre made of.

Many of these ‚Äúselect‚Äù teams and ‚Äútravel‚Äù teams aren‚Äôt even teams. They‚Äôre a group of kids playing for themselves who are missing out on a very important aspect of both life &amp; sports ‚Äî team. It‚Äôs so important to learn how to play ... and work ... with others effectively.

You learn a lot in school, don‚Äôt get me wrong. However, let me be honest ‚Äî I‚Äôve learned the most by experiencing real life. Ups, downs, successes, &amp; failures have made me who I am. The best part is that I‚Äôm still a work in progress. Being educated is different than being smart.
@BattingStanceG There‚Äôs a 50/50 shot this is @penprase33
@MeLlamoTrevor @PitchingNinja  https://t.co/S7ulZlvIy5
One of the biggest issues I‚Äôve come across in youth sports is that kids don‚Äôt know how to fail. There aren‚Äôt winners and losers anymore. A vital part of life is learning how to navigate, handle, &amp; overcome adversity. Your kids will learn a lot more from failure than from success.
Love this story. https://t.co/8dkhpUT2Bm
The Schlact family would like to wish you &amp; yours a very happy thanksgiving. Enjoy time with friends &amp; family, eat some food, &amp; take time to pause &amp; reflect on all the blessings in your life.
@FMRedHawks Happy Thanksgiving to all the RedHawks fans out there! Thankful for each and every one of you! See you in May!
What people long for is to know they matter. True and authentic leadership means reminding people on the team that no matter how big or small their role may be, they all play a part in the big picture.
@KeithTVGuy  https://t.co/lZXfVUC8gb
@KeithTVGuy ü§ê
The best leaders don‚Äôt have to talk the most. Often, the best examples are set without a word being spoken.
There is much to be thankful for, but often it‚Äôs easier to think of what burdens us. Take some time to sit &amp; think about the true blessings in your life over the next few days. You won‚Äôt regret it a bit.
Happy Birthday to one of the greatest coaches in the history of the game, @cobbbuckyball. A @CobberBaseball, @MoorheadBlues, &amp; @FMRedHawks legend. I‚Äôm so thankful to have been blessed to have been able to watch him in the dugout and have him as a mentor &amp; friend.
If you are gifted athletically &amp; are part of a team, give thanks. Thousands would trade places with you in an instant. Far too often, we take our gifts &amp; talents for granted. Open your eyes and look around. Not many can do what you do.
Every single day that you work hard to improve, you‚Äôre investing in yourself. At the end of the day, you are a brand. Represent yourself well.
Hey, John from Idaho, sorry. You won‚Äôt find a salad at my house for Thanksgiving. Jimmy from Sheboygan? You‚Äôre in luck, kid.

I'm amazed at the number of athletes that truly believe they can just show up and be successful. That may work for a while, but over time and in the end, those who work hard to master their craft will keep on succeeding. Never settle for "it's good enough."

Our Christmas tree is up early because it‚Äôs especially loved by our son and is very special to us.

Sometimes, for pitchers, that extra run can be shaved off the ERA by doing things like holding runners &amp; fielding comebackers correctly. Don‚Äôt neglect the PFP portion of your game. It‚Äôs just as important over the course of a season.
Just keep the sinks with handles, stores. These ‚Äútouchless‚Äù ones hurt my self-esteem. I end up waving my hands around like a weirdo for 10 minutes before resorting to my son‚Äôs pack of baby wipes.
@JSipper_WDAY I grew up with Sean McVay in Georgia. We went to elementary school together. Tell him what‚Äôs up! Haha
Each baseball player is unique. Don't conform to "cookie cutter mechanics" because some coach tells you that's how it should be. Be you.
Lots of talking and lots of words don't always mean lots of coaching is taking place. Motion and progress aren't the same thing.
Put yourself in the shoes of the college coach or pro scout. Would they want you on their team? Would they sign you to their organization? Set goals &amp; work to become the type of person that‚Äôs worth taking a risk on.

@duck0925 Pitching is a series of short, explosive actions. So, therefore, (overall) I embrace sprint work. Haha.
I‚Äôm still baffled that people choose to wake up early in the morning to .... run. Like, for fun. Early. In the morning.
Playing at the next level isn't solely based around on-field performance. Make sure you present yourself well in public &amp; on social media.
@bottlerocket Put a Taco Salad Shell in your local brook until a beaver makes a home. Then take it out of the water and place as the centerpiece of your table.
Changing the culture of an entire organization or team starts with changing the attitude of one person. So often we want to have a big influence, without being willing to influence one person at a time.
Happy for Cleve. The @Wingnuts_ICT have a good one at the helm! https://t.co/u46yUJ1bUR
@injuryexpert Age of the smartphone. Distraction while waiting. Red lights, lines, etc.
@HarrisIII when you're in St. Paul make sure you stop and eat at Key's. Amazing.
The best way to keep a competitive edge in your sport is to remember that whatever you play, wherever you play, &amp; despite the success you‚Äôre having, someone else is working their tail off to take your spot on the team or in the sport. Never settle.
This is literally heart-wrenching. https://t.co/Ae71wczKUs
The moment you feel that a starting role is your right rather than something you achieved or earned, you've taken two steps back. There is always someone waiting who would give anything to take that spot. Play with urgency, confidence, &amp; a desire to improve every single day.
Anything in life worth attaining won't come easily. It takes great dedication, perseverance, skill, &amp; work ethic to play at the next level.
Happiest of birthdays to the voice of the @FMRedHawks, Mr. @JackTrackItDown!
@LesParrott @RachelCruze Thank you for the Every Dollar stream of the Money &amp; Marriage Conference tonight! It was wonderful!
Placing blame &amp; shifting responsibility is NOT leading. That‚Äôs called being in charge &amp; deciding to deflect. Leading is taking responsibility &amp; taking ownership of everyone under your umbrella of care.
Always be a student of the game. Pay attention when you're playing, watch when you're on the bench, &amp; take notes when you're watching MLB.
Pitchers:  ‚Ä¢The most important pitch you'll throw all game is strike one. Don't underestimate the power of pitching ahead in the count.
If you want to be a better all around player, begin by watching &amp; listening to those around you that are better all around players.
Each baseball player has unique talents &amp; abilities. While it's necessary to watch others to learn, know yourself. Embrace your gifts.
The best teammates are ones who care more about the welfare of the team than of themselves.
Coaches:  ‚Ä¢Rules without relationships create rebellion. Care before you coach.
If you‚Äôre having trouble getting your athletes to ‚Äúbuy in‚Äù to what you‚Äôre doing, make sure the goals are attainable &amp; the vision is clear. Small, attainable goals over time add up to huge gains &amp; a clear vision is essential to showing them the way.
The higher you go in baseball, the quicker the game moves. Don't get overwhelmed. Prepare yourself fundamentally, mentally, and physically.
@JasonRomano We will all be there! Can‚Äôt wait.
Really really happy for you. I know many lives will change for the better! https://t.co/VsMmmDw0t6
If we spent half as much time working to fix the situation as we do complaining about it, think of how far we‚Äôd go.
Coaching at the next level means looking at more than just what a player does on the field. Playing at the next level means realizing that you're a brand, representing yourself with pride &amp; class, and acting like a professional in every phase of your life.
It's so easy to talk through situations that are tough. It's so hard to walk through situations that are tough. When the walk and the talk line up, people take notice. Be a light everywhere you go.
Happy for Sean McVay &amp; all his success with the @RamsNFL. https://t.co/Mo1TQyxuAI
Baffles me that people applaud coach firings. These are jobs. People‚Äôs careers. Families affected. Let‚Äôs have more sensitivity. Reminder that people don‚Äôt applaud your company when you get let go.
Teams that fall apart have a serious lack in leadership. A team that functions properly understands that cohesiveness &amp; culture start at the top but are carried out by each &amp; every person on the team. No one‚Äôs role is too little to play a part.
This is a great article about the Turnover Chain. A small thing can lead to big results when the leaders emphasize what‚Äôs important.   We &gt; Me   https://t.co/jXt5Yt2kNX
Amen to this. @mikematheny22 https://t.co/htShsQMOm7
The beautiful thing about today is that yesterday is over. If it was a good day, give thanks. If it was a tough day, learn from it. Either way, today is a new day. Embrace and enjoy it.
Everyone has a role. Some are starters and some come off the bench. Whatever your role, embrace it &amp; do it well for the good of the team.
When I can‚Äôt decide between @DunkinDonuts or @Starbucks.  https://t.co/vcOHqWfevi
The Turnover Chain is a perfect example of a simple thing that brings a team together &amp; creates a positive culture. Coaches, it's not hard to create a place where the athlete wants to show up, wants to compete, and wants to win not only for themselves .. but for their teammates.
As you move to higher levels in baseball, how you act &amp; present yourself is how your "brand" is represented. Want to be a pro? Act like one.
We are honored @ahsbucsbaseball. Thank you. https://t.co/LNizvL0o1z

It‚Äôs 55 degrees today. I‚Äôm wearing shorts. Until that temp has a 3 or a 4 in front of it, I‚Äôm holding out. It‚Äôs summertime somewhere...
@TheRealJHair @gabekapler He looks like the @UnderArmour mannequin.
We can't just show up &amp; be successful. The work, determination, &amp; dedication put in during the winter affects the success during the summer.
I feel blessed to be a part of independent baseball with the @FMRedHawks. We exist to give the former @MiLB or @MLB guy a chance to get back &amp; we give guys who missed the @MLBDraft a chance to get a foot into professional baseball. Thankful for the opportunity to be a part of it.
Embrace &amp; give thanks for the leader in your life that shows you tough love &amp; gives you constructive criticism. It's the best thing for you.
When a baseball player passes &amp; you hear stories of his compassion, grit, competitiveness, love, and genuine care for everyone he ever met ... you know that individual did MUCH more than just play a game. Rest In Peace, @RoyHalladay.
@Star_enilnO No problem.
@TopVelocity @TCDriller99 @mikenextlevel @mikereinold @CoachKsAcademy @Parqman40 Not true.

#BlackFriday should consist of sleeping in &amp; then spending the day with family &amp; friends. An overflow from Thanksgiving if you will. Consumerism isn‚Äôt bad, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the focus of the holiday season either, in my opinion. Things are gone in a flash. Love people.
The truth is that none of us truly know how much time we have left. This should cause us to embrace every second &amp; cherish time with our loved ones. Don‚Äôt take a single second for granted. What means the most aren‚Äôt always the milestone moments, but the little ones too.
The @FMRedHawks &amp; I are saddened by the sudden passing of RHP Richie Mirowski. He was a great pitcher, but more importantly, he was a great person. I was blessed to get to know him over the last few years. Rest In Peace, Ski Ski. https://t.co/tmlNOERSdI
I wanted to pitch like Roy Halladay. Then, when I saw what type of man he was, I wanted to be like him too. Devastated. Rest In Peace, Doc.
Halladay reached @MLB, was sent back to SINGLE A, &amp; rather than letting it defeat &amp; define him, he allowed it to fuel him on his road back.
Not many 2-time Cy Young winners &amp; 8-Time @MLB All-Stars invest in young baseball players like Halladay did. A classy final tweet to remember &amp; honor such a great pitcher &amp; person. https://t.co/UFKCLSH7yf
Roy Halladay embodied fire, determination, grit, &amp; character. He believed in hard work &amp; mastering his craft. Even more than all of this, he was an amazing person off the field. Rest In Peace. https://t.co/d42BLWXtYy

12 times in 13 games will do this. Morrow's arm has to be hanging. Can't even imagine. #WorldSeries
What. Is. Happening. #WorldSeries https://t.co/eHUr43f1z7
You make an error, you lead off. That's baseball. Been that way since I was 8 years old. Love it. #WorldSeries
Bill Miller handing out backward K's like Oprah hands out cars! #WorldSeries https://t.co/C47M5LvGMQ
Have to keep the ball in front of you right there, no matter what. Understand wanting to be the hero, but... #WorldSeries
You get ejected for running across the field, but you should also get ejected for playing Candy Crush if you're at this game. #WorldSeries
Dilly Dilly! https://t.co/w4iorkzpPv
This is the game that never ends, it just goes on and on my friends...some people started playing it not knowing what it was.. #WorldSeries https://t.co/8qsQsEvbdp
Think what you want ... we all know it's one of those #WorldSeries homers. https://t.co/AiCKRTc4L2
I'll take it back to Little League here, but with two strikes and an ump with a zone shaped like an amoeba -- shouldn't you at least swing?
Seager didn't like this much... #WorldSeries https://t.co/31lexlxWy5
Me, this entire #WorldSeries thus far. https://t.co/IQq0OuNIW5
The #RedSox come from behind #WorldSeries championship has to be #1, but this series is already trying to be the greatest of all time.
@DevanFink I've heard personally from guys who thought there was a difference. Not sure what to make of it. If they want the casual fan to watch, bingo
@DevanFink That was half a joke, I don't know. I guess when multiple guys from both teams are complaining, it's hard to ignore.
Slippery balls. #WorldSeries https://t.co/mfC0dJkGY1
@drivelinebases @Jordan_Dean1 @Cody_Bellinger All the time ... as you know everything is magnified in the World Series. Especially in this social media/couch manager age...
@MeLlamoTrevor Mom's spaghetti/there's something on my sweater already...
@robgreene Mostly, yeah. Ha. This series is just way to back and forth to not be exciting.
@MeLlamoTrevor yep https://t.co/Ssm9kSFKbg
It's past your bedtime. Goodnight. #WorldSeries https://t.co/shfnMYvbDy
The players play the game, but having a manager that makes you want to run through a wall sets the tone to NEVER EVER QUIT. #WorldSeries
@Cody_Bellinger Yep.
Wow, baseball. You‚Äôre the best. What a series. #WorldSeries
For the record, this is what a positive clubhouse culture looks like. Props to Dave Roberts for creating and continuing this. #WorldSeries https://t.co/mT2I9VNYTo
When turning a double play, it's the runner's job to get out of the way. The INF is taught to throw regardless. #Ouch #WorldSeries

People never remember the critic, only the hero. The best part is that you can silence a critic without ever opening your mouth.
Love that everyone was ragging @Cody_Bellinger for his 0 for #WorldSeries until last night. The best ones know to keep fighting &amp; stay calm.
This article also announces Andy Haines to the #Cubs. He started as an independent ball manager! Never give up. https://t.co/w2DDwCIWWK
Yelling ‚Äúthrow strikes‚Äù or ‚Äúhit the ball‚Äù is pointless. Sorry. You‚Äôve forgotten how tough the game is &amp; lost sight of how to help a player.
Good forward thrust of the head to eject the gum with plus downhill plane. https://t.co/Lef1GcsfVi
I have a coaching tutorial for you. Here it is: Never ever forget how hard it was to play the game. Congrats, you graduated.
@drivelinebases The ole smile and nod. Love it.
You can go 0-22 in a postseason series and still be a hero. Don't panic, don't give up, and don't get down. Stay calm &amp; stay focused.
#WorldSeries https://t.co/NdtY73LUdy
Sometimes you have to sit down with a guy &amp; remind him of what he did to help us get to where we are. Reboot that confidence &amp; restart.
You wouldn't know that Dave Roberts isn't one of the players by watching how he reacts and gets fired up. Love that. #WorldSeries
Fine line between not wanting to burst the confidence of your closer &amp; realizing that you MAY just need to remove them from that role.
@MikePinto3 Can't be sitting on your hands when the game enters that timeframe though, that's for sure.
@str8edgeracer He's awesome and hysterical.
@MikePinto3 Those who introduce a knew sequence, adjustment, pitch, etc third time through obviously are better pitchers &amp; go further. Hard to do...
@Rene_Taubensee Duh, knew that already!!
@MikePinto3 Obviously, the 3rd time through isn't cut and dry, but more times than not it seems to be the turning point in the game for the starters.
Watching @SU2C during the #WorldSeries reminds me how brutal cancer really is. EVERYONE in that stadium was affected. Some more than once.
We‚Äôve arrived. 3rd time through the lineup. Typically starters either can or cannot at this point in the game. #WorldSeries
Velocity can be taught after a pitcher learns to command the baseball &amp; he takes off. If velocity is in place &amp; he has no command? Not good.
That changeup Morton just threw? Perfect. Arm speed, location, execution. Hitters stand little chance when a pitcher perfects that pitch.
Good bloodlines. #ScoutTalk https://t.co/iAruCZmQpA

It‚Äôs great to dream of playing sports at the next level. But, if it stays a dream &amp; there‚Äôs never action to attain it, what good is it?
Most won‚Äôt agree, but the best baseball is a pitcher‚Äôs duel/close game. Not a slugfest. Masterful sequences &amp; off balance swings for life.
This pretty much played out tonight. #WorldSeries #EarnHistory https://t.co/uqO2UBeA4b
@drivelinebases @PitchMechanics @PitchingNinja @OneGun45 Love how in stadiums across America I come out of a tunnel &amp; into the dugout to hear a loud "WHAM" of the starting pitcher's weighted balls.
Because baseball. #WorldSeries https://t.co/BOeyPs49yu
Chicken Strip knew that was a 408 foot out! #WorldSeries https://t.co/25Li5gsQOj
I'm sorry, did you say .982? Wow. https://t.co/sxoE3pSfyu
"Bellinger couldn't make that play" doesn't mean it wasn't a good play. He didn't get an out -- but he did save a run. Huge. #WorldSeries
Seeing kids who are growing up in a instant result/140 character generation enjoy and appreciate baseball makes my heart happy. #WorldSeries
@joe_sheehan Me too, I meant to say that I really enjoy all your insights and that I respect your work .... but hey, what can we do? #1404Life
....... for the pitcher, not the hitter. But, yes. I agree with you. https://t.co/McTOFPYVUk
6th inning for a starter in the postseason is like the 9th inning. McCullers has defied the odds. #WorldSeries
Depending how up you‚Äôre referring to, depending on the type of hitter, depending on the pitcher &amp; movement/deception, hard to say ‚Äúno one‚Äù https://t.co/CW1M4b3c0s
Dave Roberts keeping a straight face &amp; not losing his cool right there or showing Puig up tells you what kind of man he is. #WorldSeries
Absolutely not true, but specifically I mean belt to letters. https://t.co/7io6SbG8lD
McCullers that inning: https://t.co/iovIgHuNX3
McCullers: damage control. A run scores, but given how that inning started a double play is exactly what was needed. #WorldSeries
It‚Äôs not like McCullers is saying ‚Äúno reason to focus‚Äù with a 4 run lead, but subconsciously it happens. Treat any lead like a tight one.
Sometimes, an early lead for a starting pitcher can cause them to let up. I tell my pitchers to treat a big lead &amp; a tie game the same way.
I‚Äôve had the honor of meeting him &amp; watching his act. He‚Äôs a great person &amp; incredibly entertaining. Cancer sucks.  https://t.co/9X5NcsIIOh
97 flat &amp; up ‚Äî crushed. 93 with movement ‚Äî outs. Velo is nice, location is great. #WorldSeries
#Astros not chasing pitches out of zone ‚Äî making Darvish fall behind then come into the zone. Recipe for disaster as a pitcher. #WorldSeries
The left-center power that Marwin Gonzalez displays is rather impressive. Can go with a pitch as well as anyone else. #WorldSeries
Bunt D, pep talk, etc. Not really pitching related as much as it is giving Darvish a breather, I would imagine. #WorldSeries https://t.co/wtT1gMymj6
Gurriel is the best hitter in the modern era of baseball to also sport the pineapple top hairstyle. #WorldSeries
Expect to see #Dodgers run on McCullers when they get the chance. A 47% breaking ball rate is a setup for stolen base attempts. #WorldSeries
Darvish didn‚Äôt panic that inning. Kept his cool, found his mechanics, regained his feel. It‚Äôs important to stay confident. #WorldSeries
Many athletes dream of D1 just to wear a uniform &amp; never play. If the mindset could be shifted to playing &amp; developing ANYWHERE, it's a win.
@CoachEngleLU Amen to that
@jbrady58 No, a few years later. However, I‚Äôve heard nothing but amazing things about him.
A true professional doesn‚Äôt matter what their individual stats look like so long as the team wins. We &gt; Me
Nobody likes a ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault, it‚Äôs yours‚Äù person. Take ownership, learn from the mistake, &amp; move on more wisely. No place for excuses.
To truly lead means you remember that while results are important, so are the individuals. The human factor cannot be forgotten.
Many professional players will tell you that the moment they started worrying more about the team than themselves, their own play improved.
Telling a player what they want to hear over what they need to hear simply to keep them/their parents happy is enabling &amp; helps no one.
This is every final out of the #WorldSeries since 1967 ‚Äî and it‚Äôs pure awesomeness. https://t.co/iOOphPcPcd

We can preach &amp; preach all we want -- but it will never mean quite as much to people until they see us following through with our actions.
So much more is caught than taught. This should open our eyes to the idea that as coaches it's imperative that we practice what we preach.
@KDB_MLB Moral of the story: if you're small and they tell you that you can't, develop plus tools, rip through the minors, and tear up the bigs.
For those that have ever been told that you‚Äôre not big enough to play pro baseball, please watch Altuve &amp; remember that anything can happen.
There is an obvious level of talent that it takes to reach the pro ranks. However, pro athletes work hours on end to master their craft.
I've been in professional baseball since 2004, and there's been one constant: the ones who work hard tend to succeed. Those who don't? Gone.
No one can truly force you to work hard -- that's all on you. However, when the time comes, your work ethic &amp; character will shine through.

Congratulation to the @Dodgers on their trip to the #WorldSeries¬†. I know this ‚Äî few teams have a leader like Dave Roberts. #ThisTeam

That's unreal -- on this stage -- in this game -- Kike'. Wow. #NLCS
. @ClaytonKersh22 is 99-1 with 4+ runs of support. He has 99 problems but a loss ain‚Äôt one. Well, it‚Äôs one. But only one. Okay I‚Äôm done.
The first step to being an effective leader is something you were taught early on: be honest. Honesty breeds trust. Trust breeds results.

A coach should strive to build an athlete‚Äôs talent on the field &amp; build their character off the field.
Body language not only dictates your confidence level, but theirs as well. If bad, it defeats your confidence &amp; inflates theirs. Work on it.
Yu Darvish has begun what we call a "shut down inning." They are necessary, important, and pivotal for the momentum to shift in your favor.

@castrovince Davis won‚Äôt either.

Most of the hours &amp; work you put in are not games or even practices. Training, learning, &amp; improving happen far away from the bright lights.

Don‚Äôt discount your worth because your path wasn‚Äôt as easy as other people‚Äôs. Remember, the toughest steel is forged from the hottest fire.
Your physical ability &amp; God given ability will take you there ... but your mental strength, work ethic, and character will keep you there.
A true team is a collection of individuals who decide to play &amp; fight for something bigger than themselves. It's an amazing thing to watch.
Every single one of us have gifts &amp; strengths that we were blessed with. Our job is to use them to better the world. Make today great!
What I know: that call tonight would‚Äôve been 1,000,000 times better with Vin Scully behind the mic. Can‚Äôt second guess that. #NLCS #ThisTeam
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about all that spin rate stuff ...‚Äù - @ClaytonKersh22   Sometimes, just pitch. There is such thing as paralysis by analysis.
Aspire to be better today than you were yesterday. Baby steps over time add up to giant strides. Don't discredit the small victories.
If you watch the path of the thrown baseball &amp; the short hop, Contreras was simply reacting &amp; setting up his feet to receive the throw. IMO
What you just saw from Contreras was pure athleticism and feel from a catcher to do exactly what he was supposed to do. #NLCS

There is something beautiful about the human element of the game, which replay takes away. Oh, &amp; letting the players determine the outcome.
Don't ruin baseball, replay. #MLB
As simply as I can state this: baseball is the best. #MLB
We look to the huge play in a game as the pivotal moment &amp; we realize it was the small play or the little role that made all the difference.

@DimTillard You and 3,000 other 11u dads.
@gldmeier exactly.
Right. Too many signs pointed to leaving him out of this game and going with the pen that got you there. https://t.co/4s5VClAaCW
It's easy to point to a select few who have done it successfully .. but those guys can be counted on one hand. Utilize &amp; maximize strengths.
You made the postseason with guys in certain roles performing well. Switching everything up can really get guys out of whack.
Also, short rest makes what Scherzer did very tough. I believe there is something to be said for using who got you there in their roles.
It's such a tough thing to decide ... you want your best pitcher in the game, but relieving is such a different animal than starting. #NLDS
Obviously the big blow this inning was Michael Taylor ... but Wieters bunting to beat the shift was pivotal in a number of ways! #NLDS
Goodness gracious, that little dude can mash!!! #NLDS

@CJNitkowski Don't feel too bad, my son now refers to me exclusively as Goofy.
Aspire to be better today than you were yesterday. Baby steps over time add up to giant strides. Don't discredit the small victories.
The mark of a true leader is how you handle adversity. Joe Girardi faced it head on, rallied his guys, &amp; persevered.

A coach solely looks at whether you won or lost. A leader looks at what you learned and helps you grow, regardless of a win or loss.

@darenw Usually my 87.7 MPH fastball came back to my left shin at 102.7 MPH........
@JeffPassan True, yet hard on the pitcher - especially in the postseason. Defined roles are important for preparation &amp; mentality. Understand it though.
Each day is a clean slate. We get a chance to learn from yesterday‚Äôs failures but we shouldn‚Äôt dwell on them. The time is now to move ahead.
Chapman trying to close that game out like Stryker trying to land that plane. #ALDS https://t.co/h1vKZ96ZE7
I mean, nice catch @TheJudge44 ... but no offense, that‚Äôs like the world‚Äôs tallest man dunking a basketball.
@MikePinto3 Just happened in Boston game. Hinch put in a lhp to face Devers who‚Äôs hitting really well versus lhp. Homer.
@MikePinto3 Exactly. My point was just that if you know a LHH is hitting well vs a LHP, you may not want to use that strategy. Seems counterproductive.
So many are in favor of a left on left matchup simply because it‚Äôs left on left. Just read the stats. Numbers help when deciding what to do.
The left on left matchup only works when the lefty hitting against the lefty isn‚Äôt hitting .400 against lefties on the year. #ALDS
You won‚Äôt be told this often, but it‚Äôs incredibly true: you will learn more from losing than you ever will from winning.
Jansen just showed how in a single move you can mess up the timing of both the hitter and the runner. Both equally important. Nice job.
Errors happen. On the mound, keeping your cool &amp; focusing on the next pitch is of utmost importance. Don't show up your teammates. Ever.
Never ever think a baseball game is over, especially in the postseason. Wow. Love this game.
Ah, yes. The ole bat flip single. #NLDS
If anyone wants to know where I stand in my house, my son is now exclusively referring to me as Goofy.
That was an incredible feature about Dusty Baker with @CaseyStern. As a new manager I aspire to be so much of what Dusty is within the game.
We don‚Äôt know Girardi nor his thought process. Easy to second guess from our couch. The series isn‚Äôt over yet. Let‚Äôs see how it plays out.
I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep at night knowing I COULD HAVE asked for help and possibly had it overturned as opposed to not even asking.
Heard @CJNitkowski talk about how Girardi took heat off the players and put it on himself. At the end of the day that‚Äôs what a leader does.
I understand not wanting to mess up the pitcher‚Äôs timing. I also understand why in a game of that magnitude you HAVE to ask for a replay.
As a coach, when a player asks for an eval, it's equally as important to deliver it correctly. Don't be condescending, be constructive.
@Buster_ESPN Umps don't want to get it wrong, especially with millions watching. What's been lost in replay is "Ask your partner if he had a better look"
So many of us would rather decide for ourselves what our shortcomings are, rather than asking others. Take the blinders off &amp; get better.
Don't be afraid to ask for &amp; hear the truth. It may be painful, it may be shocking, &amp; it may rub you the wrong way. But, it's always useful.
These playoff games have been taking HOURS long, and you know what? Baseball fans have been loving every single second. Pace of play? C‚Äômon.
Hendricks‚Äô changeup is like a left handed curveball. #NLDS
Noooooo. Gotta think of some creative away messages for the next few months. https://t.co/EV3snyUiuj
One of the harder things to do in life &amp; in sports is to honestly self-evaluate. Calling out your shortcomings isn't easy but its necessary!
Proof!! https://t.co/hOrCJzbrcD
What made @BauerOutage so good? Command of off speed pitches, especially early in the count. Set up hitters to purely guess most of the AB.
@drivelinebases ‚ÄúDriveline just cares about velo, no one that trains there can throw strikes.‚Äù  #Bauer  üò≥
You‚Äôre too small, they say. Not enough size, they say. You can‚Äôt generate any power with that frame, they say. Never give up, Altuve says.
@logangauer34 Thanks Logan. Appreciate that.
You can go from coach to leader by teaching about life as well as sport. It‚Äôs a line that leaders cross. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs necessary.
Don't let someone's opinion of you slow you down. Use criticism to grow and be fueled by the naysayers. It'll make all the difference.
It's hard to chase a dream without being motivated about something. Much of that comes with age. Don't count yourself out!
People often think of a certain age where it's "too late" to chase a dream. Not true. Chasing a dream doesn't have a deadline. Go for it!
@JonAcuff When I was playing in the Texas Rangers organization, our double-A team was the Frisco RoughRiders. @RidersBaseball
Adversity is a tool used to sharpen us &amp; strengthen us for what‚Äôs to come. The successful ones don‚Äôt see it as failure, they use it as fuel.
I love where baseball is right now. Young, energetic, excitable, &amp; straight up fun. Couldn‚Äôt be more excited about October baseball.
@Cocoluv1908 Ah, interesting.
@injuryexpert Interesting. It‚Äôs definitely .... off center.
Maybe the #DBacks could make a mound visit simply to straighten Rodney‚Äôs hat? #WildCard
Postseason baseball so far... https://t.co/nPcf0KZPra
I miss the intentional walk four pitches. With a runner on 3rd in #PostSeason baseball, it makes the pitcher really concentrate.
Might as well take stats and throw them out of the window. This is October baseball, where anything can happen and anyone can step up.
It‚Äôs amazing what a team can accomplish when there is one vision, one goal, and one purpose. Coaches should strive to build that unity.
Who says we all can‚Äôt agree? We can all agree on this: baseball is the greatest game the world has ever known.
I know it's part of the gig, but Holman is a great guy with a ton of knowledge. Someone will be lucky to have him! https://t.co/l030xdvioc
I have seen a lot of baseball. I'm not sure I've ever seen someone miss first base like that. Like, step right over the bag. Wow. #WildCard
Baseball‚Äôs future is bright. Wow. #postseason
Good gracious Berrios has nasty stuff. #WildCard
Pace of play? Every. Single. Fan. Loved. Every. Single. Minute.
@DomIzzoWDAY ......for the @FMRedHawks, not @mlb. Haha.
Trying to make the breaking ball nasty can cause the pitcher to ‚Äúcome around it‚Äù rather than ‚Äústay on top.‚Äù This causes lack of depth.
@bsimonnolibs Was referencing Severino &amp; Santana
Baseball. What an atmosphere. What a game. It‚Äôs the first inning of the #Postseason. We‚Äôre in for quite a ride.
A single elimination game creates nerves, no matter who you are. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre seeing a lack of command from these pitchers.
@bsimonnolibs Yankees vs Twins
It‚Äôs tough when the secondary pitches aren‚Äôt sharp either because everyone in the ballpark knows the fastball has to come.
Velocity is important. Location is more important. Hitters at the professional level will hit mistakes, no matter the velocity.
This game is far from over. That‚Äôs the beauty of baseball. It takes all 27 outs. #WildCard
Wow. Dozier. That‚Äôs a statement. #WildCard
It‚Äôs time for #Postseason baseball! Here we go!
Who‚Äôs your pick to win the American League #WildCard game?
@Mike_Ferrin @CJNitkowski @StevePhillipsGM @MLBNetworkRadio There‚Äôs still October baseball left. He can prove himself in these coming weeks.
@Mike_Ferrin @CJNitkowski @StevePhillipsGM @MLBNetworkRadio At least he‚Äôs learned his lesson regarding wearing the same tie twice on a road trip.
I‚Äôm telling you, baseball brings all the feels. https://t.co/2kw7n2yd7t

I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around what happened in Las Vegas. I know this - we should all tell our loved ones how much we love them &amp; care.
In the midst of tragedy we always see the true spirit of people shine through. Thankful for first responders &amp; brave bystanders. Wow.
On the baseball field, errors will happen. Get used to it. Remember that you aren't defined by the error, but how you react to the error.
Waking up to news of senseless and devastating tragedy in Las Vegas. I can't even wrap my head around the thought of what happened. So sad.
This is what stepping aside with dignity looks like. Terry Collins: class in the face of a really tough situation. https://t.co/Z7n4uIzNJQ
Aaaaaaaaaaaand, here comes #Postseason baseball. The best time of year.
"Why me?" A common question we ask in times of trouble. Usually that question is answered down the road when you're in the midst of success.
It's truly amazing what can happen on a team if, from the top to the bottom, everyone believes in themselves &amp; their teammates.
Coaches should strive to build a culture where players not only want the best for themselves, but also the best for their teammates.
If you polled former pro athletes &amp; ask them what they would change, I bet an overwhelming majority wishes they would've had more fun.
Baseball is a unique sport in that you don't have to be physically superior to win. Often it's finesse and mental strength that propels you.
If you play baseball and you call the season a grind, I recommend you find a new sport to play. It's not a grind if you love what you do.

A huge congrats to @RonPopeMusic for kicking off another world tour last night. Sincerely one of the best friends &amp; musicians there is.
Stepping onto the field &amp; doubting your abilities is like giving the other team a 3 run lead from the start. Have confidence in what you do.
The odds may be stacked against you, but true competitors find a way. Don't let excuses hinder you, let adversity fuel you.
So many people focus on the destination that they forget to enjoy the journey. Have long term goals but enjoy the short term experiences.
One thing I love about baseball is the life lessons it teaches. Among the best is that though you may lose, the important thing is to learn.
. @deshaunwatson gave his first check to @HoustonTexans employees who lost everything in the hurricane. Servant leadership at its best. Wow!
Lose 100+ games one year ago &amp; make the playoffs this year? Wow. What a remarkable turnaround by the @Twins! Why I love baseball so much!

We can't just show up &amp; be successful. The work, determination, &amp; dedication put in during the winter affects the success during the summer.
Yelling "stay closed" or "out front" are nothing but useless phrases that fill silence unless the pitcher understands their true meaning.

There are stats that should definitely be posted &amp; analyzed. Then there are things that can‚Äôt be counted. Heart. Grit. Fight. Perseverance.
You won‚Äôt find heart listed on the back of a baseball card, but it‚Äôs just as important as any other stat on there. https://t.co/VnhCJQxeIk

So many accept who we are right now as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs going to be.‚Äù The reality is that every day we have a pulse is a day we have a chance.
What you are right now is only important because it‚Äôs a stepping stone to who you‚Äôre becoming. Trust the process &amp; challenge yourself daily.
Criticism is either crippling or constructive. The turning point in the life of most athletes comes when a coach chooses one or the other.
Prayers for the young fan that got hit at @Yankees game. Time make extending the nets mandatory. @FMRedHawks did it this year, thankfully.
All eyes are now on the 2018 @AA_Baseball season. Looking forward to getting back out there &amp; battling again! Go @FMRedHawks!
Congratulations to the @Wpg_Goldeyes on winning the 2017 @AA_Baseball Championship. Also, congrats to the @Wingnuts_ICT for a great season.

Becoming successful in life requires one to be proactive. Work ethic carries you a long way. Same thing on the field. Don't get lazy.
@SmartBIZWpg @GoldeyesGM @Wpg_Goldeyes and he NEVER sits down. @growcasting is one of the best around.
Our work ethic (or lack of) during the winter may not be noticed right away. However, the truth will come out, usually when it counts most.
You cannot succeed in baseball only focusing on the physical side of the sport. The mental side is just as (if not more) important.
@mikelinch @KDB_MLB @SES_Smitty3 @TJScout44 @rickymeinhold @DustinKEvans @Coach_Burke_30 @FCorral34 Really blessed to know these guys.
Former @FMRedHawks LHP @brandonmmann helped the @RockHounds to a 4th straight Texas League Championship! Wow!
Many can coach, few can lead. Leaders walk alongside people through tough times. Coaches simply tell you how to make it through tough times.
Coaches aren't looking for perfection. It's unattainable. Coaches look for those who care enough to stay positive &amp; learn from mistakes.
Setting a good example is not being perfect. It's a good attitude, perseverance, and the determination to try again when things go wrong.
A bad pitch, a bad AB, a bad game ... they all happen. Focus more on what caused them and how to improve on them. Wisdom through failures.
Rather than sitting around and dwelling on what we can't control, we must get proactive and work towards improving what we can control.
The easiest thing to do in life &amp; baseball is also the hardest to stop doing. Dwelling on the past &amp; mistakes is crippling to development.
Lists like this from our @FMRedHawks website show the impact that independent baseball has within @MLB orgs.   https://t.co/8WsVkMfgpI
Blessed to be a part of @AA_Baseball. Independent baseball is proving over &amp; over again that it helps start and restart @MLB careers.

When you step on that mound, have confidence in your abilities &amp; conviction in your pitches. Believing you can is half the battle.
Coaching from T-Ball to professional ball doesn't change in that you still should respect &amp; care for those you're leading.
Players who believe that it takes an entire team to win are the players who ultimately will continue finding jobs in their sport.
Building a culture that involves positivity, encouragement, &amp; fun is just as essential as working on mechanics &amp; training.

I am so proud of each &amp; every one of the @FMRedHawks. They have grit &amp; guts. They stay calm &amp; confident. They never ever quit. Love it!
If you can make the most of small opportunities given to you, eventually you'll be given bigger &amp; bigger opportunities. Embrace your role.

Everyone is different. Some "get it" early while others take more time. The important thing is to keep working hard &amp; to never give up.
@JonAcuff Comfort is real if we're comfortable in the right things. Being comfortable can be a sign that we're not growing. The sting could be growth!
Pitching with confidence and conviction is a must. There are lots of pitchers with MLB stuff but few with MLB attitudes. Work on it.
@hogansons @FMRedHawks Hoping for a super quick recovery. Let me know ANY TIME you need tickets &amp; you'll be all set.

When you step on that field with a negative attitude, you're already three steps behind your opponent. Stay positive &amp; remain confident.
The true beauty of baseball lies in the human error, the calculated pace of play, the pitching changes, and double-switches. Leave it alone.

There are many things you CAN control, like your attitude &amp; character. Spend time on those things. Don't worry about what you can't control.
The game is never over until the last out is made. Keep grinding, keep fighting, &amp; keep competing. You never know what could happen.

Baseball is a sport for a short term memory. Whatever happened last inning, last game, or last season should be learned from not dwelled on.
Anything can happen at any time in baseball. Throw every pitch with purpose. Run every base with intent. Play every out with passion.

A good teammate will always communicate to his team what they saw the pitcher throw, what the movement was, &amp; where the arm slot was.
A sad reality is that many parents want their kids to succeed in sports so badly that they end up pushing them so hard they quit altogether.

Coaches are less concerned with the fact that you made an error &amp; more concerned with how quickly you learn &amp; bounce back from it.

Our true character is exposed when adversity strikes. People rarely remember how you played, but they'll definitely remember how you acted.
As baseball players, having a short term memory is critical. Learn from yesterday but don't dwell in it. A loss isn't a loss if you learned.

The best way to silence the critics on the baseball field is to let your play do the talking.
It's ok to be out-played. It's not ok to be out-worked. Losing is part of a game, but make sure you didn't lose due to lack of preparation.

It's Opening Day for the @FMRedHawks! Can't wait to get started. Excited for the team we've put together. Best day of the year! @AA_Baseball
A team is a collection of people working together for a common goal. It's not one person trying to carry the entire team on their back.
Those in the field playing behind the pitcher don't want someone who is a human rain delay. Pitch with intent, focus, &amp; good rhythm.
A pitcher should step on that mound and recognize that they're in control of the game. They set the tempo &amp; tone from the first pitch.
When in Texas... https://t.co/PDEc27F83M

Excuses expose immaturity. Those who own up to mistakes not only learn to self-evaluate but also gain wisdom from overcoming obstacles.
The odds may be stacked against you, but those are the moments when you can choose to give up or reach down and see what you're made of.
My mom sacrificed so much of her own free time to be at the ball field with me. I'm forever thankful for her &amp; her love. #happymothersday

Leaders don't always have to be vocal. Often, leading by example says more than any words you could ever speak.
Yesterday, for an hour, I hit ground balls to professional infielders so they could work solely on footwork. Don't. Forget. Fundamentals.
People think that pro ballplayers are too good to work on fundamentals. Wrong. The best practice them daily &amp; never forget the foundations.
It's hard to make it &amp; even harder to stay. That's why preparation is important, but work ethic &amp; character are too. Work on it.
If you make a mistake, take a step back and learn something from it. When you do, you'll move forward again with more confidence &amp; wisdom.
Happiness will come and go, but joy endures. The moment you find joy in what you're doing is the moment you become unshakeable.
Pitching is a unique blend of power and finesse. There's no room for "throwers" because it's the "pitchers" that excel day in and day out.
There may be room for improvement in certain areas. Recognizing what you need to work on is different than ditching who you are completely.
Players get into trouble when they look around &amp; see others that do something differently or better. Don't strive to conform. Just do you.
A team is made up of several individuals who come together, work together, &amp; fight together to achieve a common goal. Buy in to the process.
Recognize the skills you bring to the team &amp; embrace those. Don't try to be like everyone else, because then you lose what makes you unique.

Our past does not define who we are, but it does define who we are to become. Don't dwell on where you've been-learn from where you've been.
There has to be a "why" behind everything you do on the field. If it doesn't have a purpose, you can't expect progress.

Far too often, fear holds us back. Far too often, we forget faith drowns out fear, and that being prepared can eliminate the need to fear.
So often we try so hard to be who we're not that we completely forget who we are. Embrace your strengths &amp; make the most of your talents.
Pitchers: Stop looking in the dugout 32 times an inning. You're battling, not the coach. Step up, make pitches, and trust your abilities.
A beautiful thing about a new day is that there's a clean slate. Sure, you can't change the past. However, you can learn from it &amp; move on.
I'm embarrassed for this umpire. This is a joke. https://t.co/G7gyni1oZi
It's far more important to worry about what you can control than to worry about what you can't. Work hard &amp; trust the process every day.
Beware of coaches that want to put their "stamp" on you. Typically, it's all about them, not you. Know your body, do research, &amp; be careful.
Keys to a delivery that you should be focused on are timing &amp; repeatability.
There are some fundamental principles of a delivery/mechanics that must be in place. However, there must be some originality/deception.
For every "perfect mechanic" pitcher, may I introduce you to ten that don't do it by the book? What you call weird, they call effective.

When parents bail their kids out of situations that cause failure, they harm long term growth opportunities. At times, losing is learning.
Owning failure in sports creates a lifelong habit of learning from mistakes. There is no growth opportunity with excuses.
Pitching inside means pitching fearlessly. It means taking ownership of the plate. It means showing the batter you're in control. It works.
This is the best thing you'll see all day. I love baseball. https://t.co/bUzdSj3cIf

Far too often, coaches are putting the roof on the house before they build the foundation. Teach. The. Fundamentals. First.
I watch coaches spend hours at practice working on trick plays &amp; specialty skills for players. When it's game time, they can't catch a ball.
It's important to remember that games aren't really won or lost in the run column. Free bases, errors, &amp; wasted AB's are quick ways to an L.
Heroes in baseball don't always hit a walk-off homer. Often, they run out a grounder &amp; are safe or they move a runner into scoring position.
At the end of the season see how many 1 run games you won or lost. It makes or breaks the season. Do not take the little things for granted.
Lofty dreams are great, but a dream without a plan is just a wish. Take the small steps now that will add up to huge strides later on.

Who you are and whose you are never change. What you do can change in an instant. Make sure your attention &amp; focus are on the right things.
As a pitcher, when you take ownership of the plate everything changes. Pitching inside and moving the hitter's feet are crucial for success.

Baseball isn't boring, you're boring. https://t.co/D4GvAVWxI7
Critics &amp; naysayers will always be around. They're not worth your time. Stay the course, work hard, and let the results silence them.
Baseball is unique in that to be successful you don't have to be the biggest, strongest, or fastest. Embrace your skills &amp; master them.
One of the hardest things in life is to go against the grain. Not many are extraordinary because not many want to do extra. Swim upstream.
The path to success is uphill, rocky, &amp; often slippery. Not many people make it up because not many people are willing to sacrifice &amp; work.
Often, it's not the error that defines us on the field, it's the reaction to the error. Don't let it affect the next play. Learn &amp; move on.
Baseball IS NOT OVER until the last out is made. Never stop fighting. Never quit trying. Never lose hope. You never know what could happen.
One of the toughest things a young athlete deals with is the unmet dreams of their parents which become unrealistic expectations on them.

At some point, your dreams need to take flight &amp; action needs to begin. If you never start working for it, you'll never actually reach it.
@TheCUTCH22 Saw you playing in that baseball weather today. ‚òÉÔ∏è

Thankful to be a part of a league that fully promotes players chasing their dream. @AA_Baseball is a legit platform. https://t.co/f1n7YH4A1j
Yeah, well, do it in a game. Oh wait. https://t.co/Y1E3kodhky

@KevinMcAlpin Game tonight?
@drivelinebases Thank you
It's @MiLB Opening Day! I was blessed enough to enjoy 10 of them as a player &amp; this season will be my 3rd as a coach. https://t.co/Hm0yU4zdDP
Just as each &amp; every action on the baseball field should have a purpose &amp; be intentional, so should your thoughts. Focus &amp; lock in mentally.
Today, rise up in confidence &amp; faith. Forget the shortcomings of yesterday &amp; move ahead with joy, peace, &amp; trust.
You aren't going to be handed success. Often, the "overnight success" is years in the making. Be prepared to work hard &amp; overcome adversity.
If you wouldn't build a house without first pouring the foundation, then don't coach baseball without first teaching the fundamentals.
@robfee hint: usually the secret involves a new recipe that he tried for dinner &amp; also the new, hip restaurant to try in town.
Excuses are roadblocks to success. Owning your mistakes &amp; learning from them is the fuel you need to power through adversity.
It's surreal how quickly life happens. I remember being terrified of thunderstorms as a kid &amp; now I'm comforting my own son through them.

@TerryEvans17 @jamesramsey23 @eastpoleATL Let's go. Ease the burden.
A true leader doesn't always have to be vocal. Leading by example is often just a crucial is leading with words.

Learning to react positively to negative situations is a reason why athletes continue to go to the next level. Talent only goes so far.
Athletes that have small roles during games often complain, forgetting that TEAM is above SELF. What can you do to contribute? Buy in.
Doing the little things helps to win big games. Covering first, a sac bunt, or hitting the cutoff man may seem insignificant, but it's HUGE!
Repeatable mechanics = repeatable results. Strive to learn how your body works &amp; make the most of it.
The best players never seem to panic. They have a sense of courage, confidence, &amp; competitiveness that keeps them up even when they're down.
I'll be on @740TheFAN with @JackTrackItDown in about 10 minutes talking @FMRedHawks &amp; who knows what else! Listen: https://t.co/SwewhGcqaX
Players don't take their time in the bullpen or the on-deck circle seriously &amp; then wonder why they didn't succeed. Preparation is key.
There is a very fine line between helping &amp; enabling. Let your child learn from adversity &amp; failure. It'll help them become wiser adults.
On the baseball field, errors, Ks, &amp; bad pitches happen. It's not that they happen, it's how quickly you bounce back that matters most.
We can go through life chasing a dream, working toward goals, &amp; searching for purpose while completely forgetting to have some fun. Enjoy.
I'm just going to say it. I love baseball. Everything about it. Gives me chills. Makes me happy. Fires me up.
Winning isn't always a product of talent. Those who think, work, &amp; hustle can beat the more talented team a lot of the time.

As an athlete, when you finally step on a field with a "I know I can" attitude instead of a "I hope I can" attitude, everything will change.
Ordinary athletes will find excuses for why things didn't work out. Champions lose the excuse &amp; work to make sure it doesn't happen again.
It's going to be a great day, @MLB is back!
A grind implies something you HAVE to do &amp; must force your way through. If you call baseball a grind, don't play. You should love it.
@MikeSkogen Put that way, radar gun. Just think it's sad regardless.
@RealCJ10 Thank you for playing the game for the game. Baseball is a lifestyle, a passion, &amp; a love. Chasing $ may leave you rich but poor.
Parents with radar guns at 12u games will be the end of me. Let. The. Kids. Play.
I'm not quite sure that's how it's done. https://t.co/nMFDEloF8J
This is awesome. The culmination of many hours chasing a dream that most say is nearly impossible. @brockstassi28 https://t.co/nq4R3KgaOt
Far too often, we quit when things get tough. Don't forget that the toughest steel is forged from the hottest fire. Push through.
Pitchers:  ‚Ä¢Learn to pitch inside effectively &amp; with intent. Lose the fear of hitting the batter. It's part of the game. The plate is yours.
Having your parents bail you out of every mess &amp; every less than ideal situation may help you now, but it'll really hurt in the long run.
Society/culture has been trying to make us buy this lie that success looks a certain way. It's not the same for everyone. Do what you love.
I was amazed each time I moved up the ladder in baseball. It wasn't always the talent that jumped each time, it was consistency &amp; approach.
When I talk to college coaches or pro scouts about a prospect, they talk some about their talent &amp; A LOT about their character.
Many realize too late that it was something they could control that held them back &amp; all along they were worried about what they couldn't.
The more you look around and notice what other people have, you'll begin to forget what you have. Embrace your skill set &amp; talents.
It's not an error, a bad pitch, or a strikeout that defines you. It's whether or not you learn from it &amp; fix it moving forward that does.
Losing a game because you simply got out-performed is ok. Losing a game because you simply got out-worked is not. Always. Be. Prepared.
You won't like every coach you have just like you won't like every boss you have. Learn how to deal with that now &amp; save a headache later.
