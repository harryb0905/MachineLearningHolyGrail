@PitchingNinja @FlatgroundBats People in professional baseball shouldn’t forget the power of one action, one word, or one gesture. People look up to professional baseball players &amp; coaches as heroes. This is awesome, @ABREG_1. Baseball wants more fans? Follow this lead.
Being out-performed is understandable.  Being out-worked is not.  It takes ZERO talent to work hard. The time is now to cut the excuses &amp; get to work. At the end of the day, it’s easier to say you gave it your all &amp; simply lost rather than you didn’t prepare well enough.
@B_Horn22 Quite a crew right there.
@coach_tj5 I would skip over it. Don’t @ me.
@drivelinebases 🔥🔥🔥 love that
@Krick_Nation45 Disgusting bean. Cmon man.
This is absolute 🔥 from @TimTebow. Listen! https://t.co/LB4YY4YeOg
So you have talent? So do many others. What separates you is how you handle failure, how you respect &amp; listen to coaches, whether or not you show up teammates when things go wrong, &amp; whether or not you respect the uniform.  Talent doesn’t always set you apart but character does.
Reminder:  Success ON the field is directly related to your work OFF the field.  If you don’t want to put the work in when the lights are off you’ll never be able to sustain success while they’re on.
Doing something without a “why” is nothing more than wasted movement and wasted time.  It doesn’t matter how insignificant it may seem. Giving it a purpose drives you &amp; keeps you engaged + motivated to the finish, not just until it gets tough.
@berndtcakes @FMRedHawks Thanks so much

So many young athletes say they want to be the best, yet when you watch how they act, how they prioritize things, and most importantly how they practice, it rarely shows.   You want to be the best?  Take care of yourself, prepare, &amp; practice better than the rest.
@lee_gale9 @FMRedHawks Thanks Lee. Appreciate your care getting us where we needed to be safely &amp; back to my family. Can’t go unnoticed.
@atrenz10 Renz, your future is bright my man. Appreciate everything &amp; thank you for being a huge part of what we did. Big things ahead for you!

The stats are stacked against you making it, there’s no doubt about it.  However, chase it with a “watch me make it” mindset rather than a “will I make it mindset.”   Stop asking why &amp; start asking why not.
Really proud of you, @lefty_TA. Couldn’t be happier for you for what you’ve accomplished. Blessed to have played a small part in your journey. https://t.co/ZU7MxOiKNO
Baseball is won and lost by the simplest parts of the game like catching, throwing, baserunning, &amp; strikes.   We want to complain when it’s time to practice them.  We don’t take it seriously because we think we’re too good for them.  Winners do the little things right every time.
Pitchers are athletes too.  https://t.co/wLkIBG0RAz
Today is a new day. Yesterday may have been rough, didn’t go the way you’d hoped, or been full of setbacks.  That’s ok.   Wake up today knowing that adversity isn’t meant to be a roadblock, but a speed bump. It’s not meant to be a dead end, but a detour. Stay positive.
Unify your team and individualize your players.   One team, many individuals.   One goal, many roles.   One purpose, many ways to achieve it.
Success right now is a result of the hard work (or lack of) from before. Rarely are there instant success stories.   Those who are successful have built a foundation of hard work, determination, perseverance, &amp; smarts.   You can’t go at 50% and expect to get 100% return.

The most successful people aren’t always the most talented.  They do, however, make the most of what they have. They give 100% of whatever % they have.  Talent gets you there, of course. But, character &amp; work ethic keep you there.

We learn more about ourselves through adversity than we do through success.  Though it’s no fun at the time, hold on.   In the end, you’ll become better if you let adversity teach you rather than defeat you.
@PitchingNinja The ole left handed slider from the right handed pitcher.
If everything was easy &amp; we coasted through, we’d never learn perseverance, grit, or how to properly handle adversity.   There’s a reason for everything. Even though struggles aren’t fun, they’re necessary for true growth.  In the long run, we’re better for going through them.

When recruiters, coaches, scouts, etc are watching you, remember that talent on the field is important.   However, how you carry yourself off the field, how you wear your uniform, treat your teammates, parents, coaches, etc is important too.   Don’t neglect those things. Ever.
There are countless learning styles, upbringings, temperaments, body styles, attitudes, &amp; personalities.  Why, then, would we coach everyone the same way?  If we truly want to get the most out of our team then we owe it to ourselves and our athletes to individualize our teaching.
@lokationnation Set attainable goals that allow them to reach it and succeed repeatedly. From there, up the ante. Telling them they can is one thing. Showing them they can is another. Them feeling it is when the next level is taken.
Every single player on a roster is important.   Championship teams don’t get caught up too much in status or roles.   They simply prepare &amp; are ready whenever they’re called upon in whatever role the coach sees fit.   Work hard, be ready, play hard.

The @FlatgroundApp &amp; @PitchingNinja helped a guy get back to affiliated baseball again, and we all sit back and watch what a positive power of social media looks like.  This is 2019. Don’t underestimate the power of social media. Recruiting looks different than ever before.
@SBriend97 @big_nate5 @DanTorrenti https://t.co/eCDD0B5A0G

Surround yourself with people who:  •believe in you •are truthful with you •want success for you •bring the best out of you  Who you hang with says lots about what you stand for, what you believe, &amp; where you’re going. If you want to change your trajectory change your circle.
@CaptHook37 @FlatgroundApp This is my favorite one yet.
One thing that’s commonly mistaken throughout life is the opportunity to learn from ... not be defined by ... failure.   Everyone fails. You’re not exempt.  The difference comes when you realize that failure is something that happens to you, it’s not a description of you.
Leaders rise because of qualities that are selfless &amp; giving.   Many sit there once they’ve reached the position &amp; then only worry about themselves &amp; abandon whatever got them there.   Leadership is selfless, giving, and sacrificial.  The higher you go the more you should serve.
The best coaches understand that while they may be developing good players, they’re really developing great people. A game is temporary.  Your athlete will go into the world &amp; impact many. They’ll become parents, teachers, &amp; leaders. Your influence on them can impact generations.
Every coach dreams of this. File this under the “things you can’t teach” category.  https://t.co/KDJVu4AcuC

A championship team doesn’t always have the most talented players, but it does have the most resilient &amp; gritty players.  When tough times come (and they will), those who are equipped to handle it &amp; walk through it positively will always succeed.
Taking a family picture with a 3 year old and a 9 month old is something like successfully herding scared cats.
You may not know it all. However, we all have perspective. Pitching coaches can talk hitting, from a pitcher perspective. Hitting coaches can talk pitching, from a hitter perspective.  Educate yourself, figure out your perspective, &amp; help players get better.
Rare traits in today's athletes that coaches admire:  -Hustle -Grit -Mental toughness -Selflessness -Positively handling adversity -Competitiveness -Coachability -Team first above all else

You won’t win the big games without mastering the little things.  Championships are won as a result of the work that’s put in when the stadium lights are off and nobody’s watching.  Start now, work hard, win later.
COACHES:  • Reminding the player how they succeeded in the past rather than how they failed in the past is much more effective. Build them up.
Being a good teammate &amp; a good leader looks something like this.  https://t.co/pJpHKKFrZd
If you want to lead, do so by example. It doesn’t matter what you say, it’s what you do.   Words will carry zero weight if the actions don’t validate them.
Losing, believe it or not, can be the best thing to happen. Without it we’ll never learn the necessary discipline, determination, &amp; drive needed to ultimately win.  Temporary disappointment to a loss is fine. Dwelling in it &amp; letting it define you is not.  Be fueled by adversity.
This is fantastic.  https://t.co/mTuHg9TnFM
Failure must happen. It’s critical to the success story. Without it, one will never know how to handle adversity WHEN ... NOT IF ... adversity strikes.  Those who succeed understand failure’s role &amp; used it to rebound &amp; reload.  We either succeed or succumb. The choice is ours.

Whether you’re a coach, recruiter, parent, or player, @FlatgroundApp is an amazing resource for you. The power of social media is alive &amp; well.   Search, find, learn, grow, and study.   If you need players, want to grow your players, or want to grow as a player, follow now.

Those who don’t understand the process of success will mock you &amp; make fun of you in your failure.  Those who understand the process of success will cheer you on &amp; push you forward in your failure.  You. Will. Fail.  The key is failing forward &amp; having the right folks around you.
@billiejauss So good!!
@KeithTVGuy @FMRedHawks Hahaha!! You got it.
When a smart coach teaches your child something &amp; you go home to re-teach the way YOU think it should be done:   1. You’re teaching the child to disregard those in a leadership role.  2. You’re not allowing the child to learn independence &amp; how to learn by potentially failing.
Coaches are always watching.   Practice with intent. Play with passion. Perform with confidence.
@KeithGrunewald @jamesramsey23 Congrats!!
It’s no secret that social media is huge these days.  That being said, be smart.  Don’t undo years of hard work because you don’t think before hitting send.
When most consider failure a dead end, a successful person considers it a detour.  When most consider adversity a road block, a successful person considers it a speed bump.  When most consider hardship a stumbling block, a successful person considers it a stepping stone.  #KeepOn

If you aren’t teaching &amp; training people to win AND lose with class, you’re doing them a disservice.   Losing with class &amp; accepting that there is much to be learned from it is a part of life.  Keep your nose down when you win &amp; keep your head up when you lose.
Teams are never truly teams until you replace the selfish with the selfless.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/rUApiPmSGL
If you say, “what do they know? they were just a minor league coach” when your favorite mlb team hires them to the big league staff, remember:  The players who are successful today in the big leagues were developed &amp; helped by those minor league coaches years before.
It takes one second to undo years of progress. Be smart.
How often do leaders look down on those they’re leading when they fail &amp; put on a performance of “I have never failed.”  This is the worst possible way to get the most out of them, because they’ll begin striving for something they’ll never achieve ... perfection.  Be vulnerable.
What you are going through or what you went through can be used to help others as they go through it now.  True inspiration isn’t about seeing someone who’s never failed or messed up. True inspiration is seeing someone who’s failed or messed up walk through it wisely &amp; overcome.
Self-evaluation is key to improving. Learn to be honest enough to tell yourself what you need to work on.  From there, put yourself in the company of those who will be truthful enough to call you out, push you forward, &amp; help you grow.  Develop a plan, learn from mistakes, &amp; go.
Build a culture that makes others want to be a part of it.  Place emphasis on character. Place emphasis on winning. Place emphasis on selflessness. Place emphasis on losing with class. Place emphasis on we&gt;me.  Leaders that don’t give direction end up with lots of lost followers.
Rarely does success come when there’s a lack of work ethic, a lack of character, and a lack of grit.  Work ethic produces good habits, character produces good choices, and grit produces good perseverance.
@RyanMaue What weather app (if any) do you recommend
Leadership is taking something complicated &amp; communicating it simply &amp; clearly.  Too often we lack the necessary simplification &amp; communication required to get the most out of those we lead.  Big words don’t make you smart. A true understanding of what you’re talking about does.
It’s not hard to encourage, and often it’s all someone needs to turn their day around.  Rather than consistently looking inward &amp; being blinded by what’s around us, let’s look outward to see how we can bless, encourage, &amp; lift others.  It’s what the world needs right now.
Your role on a team may start small, but big, important roles are always earned over time.  Consistency, integrity, reliability, &amp; productivity are key.  Someone at the top doesn’t just decide they want to be there. They start  at the bottom &amp; prove themselves time and again.
Check your mindset if you think practice is boring.  Regardless of what you do, practicing is refining your craft.  The best are never outworked &amp; find joy in the process of improvement.  If you don’t have the drive to practice, you won’t be driven to succeed.
So you want a platform? You have one. Want an audience? You have one.  You don’t need a big stage, thousands of followers, or a big title.  You need one person, in one place, and one message.  If you want to change the world, start with one person.
You may not feel like getting up, getting out, and getting better.  But ...   For every moment you wait, someone else is ready to work.  Not being talented enough is one thing, but being outworked?  Unacceptable.
@FlatgroundApp Much appreciated. Keep doing what you’re doing. Careers &amp; lives will be changed. Social media gets a bad name sometimes, but things like this show what it’s meant for.
Listen:  •@FlatgroundApp is exactly what this era of recruiting is all about. Use technology &amp; social media to your advantage.  I manage the @FMRedHawks, a professional team, &amp; we’ve used platforms like Twitter to sign players before.  Embrace it, use it, &amp; give thanks for it.

I have a good idea.   Let’s get a longhorn and a dog (wearing red) to meet up before a football game.   That should end well.   #SugarBowl
Winners find a way.  Everyone else finds an excuse.
“It’s how it’s always been” just wont cut it. Sure, there’s safety there. But, complacency crushes creativity.  We live in a world where technology is increasing. With that, so should our understanding that “why change it” could become “why not change it” if it’s for the better.

We strive for physical health &amp; focus on strengthening that part of our game, yet we neglect the mental side.   The physical side is important, don’t get me wrong.   But, what good is any of it if when we step between the lines we crumble under pressure or can’t handle adversity?
Coaches, before you take on the role, put your playing days to rest.  The shoulda woulda mentality is toxic around young players.  Meet them where they are, don’t take them where you thought you should’ve been.
Coaches:  • If you want to lead them, first you’ve got to love them.  It’s common to hear “coach just doesn’t get me.” That’s a barrier to getting the most out of an athlete because if you don’t know them or what makes them tick you’ll never know how to properly motivate them.

Coaches:  •Lead from a “what can I do for you” instead of a “what can I get from you” mindset. Not only will you grow better people, but you’ll grow better athletes too as they learn what it means to be accountable, proactive, &amp; selfless.
Players:  •You can have the best tools, science, data, and coaching at your disposal, but if you haven’t developed your mental strength for competition none of it will matter. It’s not one-sided.
@EWErickson @DaveRamsey Yes. Life changing.
Pitchers:  • The foundation of all that you do is understanding your body, how it works, why it works the way it works, and what movements create rhythmic explosiveness &amp; which ones prevent it.  Start there.
@MarioDB @MLB It’s not exploiting, it’s willing participation. These people want a better life &amp; now are offered that. The previous way was trafficking, smuggling, rafts, ripped apart families, &amp; deaths at an attempt to chase a dream. MLB opening the door is preventing all this.

I don’t care how talented they are. If they show up teammates, don’t work hard, won’t buy in to the team culture, or never tries to be a good teammate, they’re not worth it.  A warning to players: coaches can find talent. Don’t eliminate yourself because of a controllable.

One of the best things you can do for a child who participates in organized sports is to let the coach coach.  Don’t hover, don’t comment, don’t criticize.  1. You’ll teach them to respect leadership figures. 2. You’ll teach them to grow up. 3. You’ll teach yourself self-control.

@EricStangel @cvspharmacy Hear ye hear ye I issue this decree....
Rarely does something less than ideal happen where we give thanks for what wasn’t because of what could be. Things happen for a reason. Maybe, just maybe, it’s because we’re supposed to slow down, give thanks, &amp; be present.   Control what you can control.
We live in a time when everyone is trying to hide their mistakes &amp; mess ups. All the while, more people are hurting &amp; looking to connect with someone who can help than ever before.   Your past, your mistakes, &amp; your mess meets people where they are. Embrace it &amp; change the world.
@drivelinebases I love how the “status” stigma is being broken. It does not matter where you’ve been or what you’ve done. If you know baseball &amp; are educated with the direction baseball is going &amp; able to adapt, you can be hired.
Coach, your way isn’t the only way. If you have a cookie cutter mentality, you’re missing it. All of it.  Each athlete learns, interprets, and applies differently. Besides that, each athlete has different body composition, physical limitations, &amp; abilities.  Individuality.
@drivelinebases Nutt finished the year 95-97 with an absolute hammer. He was devastating. Really proud of him &amp; I believe this is his time. Following @brandonmmann’s footsteps. Indy to the show.
A lack of work ethic doesn’t always become exposed immediately. It does, however, always become exposed.  Put in the work now to reap the results later.  Coaches like talented players but they love hard working players.

Happy 12th anniversary to the love of my life. I’m so thankful to be with someone who loves me unconditionally, supports me unwaveringly, &amp; will be there for me no matter what. The joy of my life has been being your husband &amp; building a family with you. Love you! https://t.co/MW4TykDz3i

Champions lose just like everyone else.  Champions fail forward, though.  Losing teaches, instructs, and disciplines.  The difference between a champion &amp; everyone else is how they handle the adversity thrown their way.
Can you imagine if your true love sent you the gifts from the 12 Days Of Christmas song 12 days in a row? Talk about anxiety.
Be nice to those around you on your way up. Why?  1. You don’t know where they’ll be in a few years. Don’t burn a bridge you may need. 2. Just because they’re “below you” doesn’t mean they won’t be “above you” soon.  You may need them on your way back down.

Our thoughts are able to be “captured” if you really think about it. So many emotions come in &amp; go out every few minutes that we can easily become overwhelmed. Let’s learn to filter &amp; fix those thoughts on what is true &amp; right. It could be a game changer for us all. https://t.co/tkremmwxBs
It should never be beyond us to look beyond us. There are people everywhere who need guidance, love, grace, and direction.   If we’re always focused on ourselves we’ll never be able to focus on others.
We can learn so much more from a loss than we can from winning. While it's painful, it's also educational if our mindset is right.
Wanting to accomplish something great starts with a why.   Heading towards a dream or a goal without a why is like driving a car with a blindfold on.  Sure, you’re headed somewhere. But, the chances of reaching your destination are very, very slim.
We can say all we want &amp; want what we say, but until we live out what we say &amp; prove ourselves to be legit we will never truly lead them.

The best thing you can do for your team is to be a leader.  Leaders don’t always have to be the outspoken one.  Leading can be by example many times in the way you work, live, and interact with others.  Most of the time, people look to leaders during tough times, so be ready.
It’s like I blinked &amp; I’m 33 years old today with an amazing wife &amp; the two best boys in the world. Couldn’t be more thankful.  Each year I learn something about myself. Getting older isn’t bad, it’s a blessing to be alive. Can’t wait to share what I’ve learned with my boys.
@BenjBowman Thanks bud
Today is a new day.  Yesterday is over. If there were mistakes, setbacks, or failures, learn from them &amp; move on more wisely.  If there were successes, steps forward, or positives, embrace them &amp; move on more wisely.  Keep your head up when you fail &amp; your nose down when you win.
Thank you, @frankienbennys! Bring back family time! Hope others follow suit. https://t.co/gLtBCYhDcf
When you know God, everything you do comes FROM acceptance not FOR acceptance.
If we feel like God is disappointed when we miss the mark then we’ve missed the boat &amp; ultimately missed the message of the Cross.  He came TO us when we were messed up to walk alongside us ... NOT when we had it all together already.

Scouts &amp; evaluators are always watching. Remember, it’s not always about how well you do when they see you. Sometimes, seeing an athlete “fail forward” is exactly what was needed.  If your teammate makes a mistake, don’t show them up. Pick them up.  If you make a mistake, learn.
@JarridWilson I’ve never felt more helpless than when both boys are miserably sick at the same time. Hold on tight it’ll be okay before you know it.
Why would you expect to excel in games when you won’t put in the effort during practice?  The person that says practice is a waste of time is the person that’ll never reach their true potential.
So you want to be successful?   PRACTICE with a PURPOSE. PREPARE with a PLAN. PLAY with a PASSION.

There’s a misconception that leaders have to be vocal at all times.   “To lead you have to be heard.”  Not true.  Often what impacts people most is what you do after what you say.   Your actions will validate your words. Lead by example.

@xanbarksdale That sends more of a message than running to other players. IMO.

Also to note here is Carter’s receiving &amp; presentation. No jumping, raising, stabbing. Letting the ball travel &amp; not giving up on it is key for both the pitch &amp; the umpire’s visual.
Changes in arm slot for different pitches isn’t a bad thing. Very few pitchers can change slots successfully over and over.   For the majority of pitchers, mechanics that mirror one another is key for deception &amp; health.
“Why do they hit my breaking ball?”  Well, it’s probably very easy to see. Note the mechanics above. Similar if not exact in body/arm/slot.

@PitchingNinja Scott Feldman &amp; @Dutch_Oven45 the lucky recipients of that advice.
@coachballgame Makes sense. Never seen it.
We feel like we can’t help others if we’ve failed in some way.  The best way to help others is to be relatable.  No one wants to be looked down on while they’re down, they want to be looked in the eye while you lift them up.  Your failures allow you to meet people where they are.
@ABCA1945 A5: before you can develop the person you have to know the person. Knowing the person allows you to know what makes them tick, what motivates them, and what they’re passionate about.   Besides that they have to know that you love them before they’ll let you lead them.   #ABCAchat
@ABCA1945 We don’t use too much technology but we do have access to spray charts and old fashion pitcher charts. They don’t lie!! The key is being able to communicate those to the players and let them understand what’s important from them.  Don’t have to spend thousands to teach. #abcachat
@ABCA1945 A2 (cont) We don’t let an opportunity pass to coach them up, whether in game, after, or before. Letting the player know the minute something happens is key to both learning &amp; understanding we’re there for them &amp; care about their development. #ABCAchat
@ABCA1945 A2: pitcher/catcher meetings before every series &amp; stay on the defense in game with moves/tendencies. This helps them learn the opponent but also teaches them about what to look for when similar opponents are being played.  Early work is huge for individualized work. #ABCAchat

@caphillips3 Yeah most likely. Still not the best look. Emotion is nice though.
@caphillips3 It’s happened. Honestly, all depends on how big the situation was. Definitely can be construed as tamper tantrum. The guy’s personality, the type of teammate he is, clubhouse guy, all go into account.   Overall I don’t like it &amp; we had a quick call to the pen after it happened.
@jesseknoll It’s more about instincts. Yes. Knock the ball down. But seeing the throw, understanding the footwork, timing, etc is the hard part.
#RedSox fans:  Regardless of the outcome of the game with Eovaldi on the mound, that was a selfless, gutty performance. Don’t lose sight of what he did for the team.  That was a pitching performance for the ages.  Kudos, Eovaldi.   #WorldSeries

I once had a Dodger Dog.   It’s a regular ole hot dog.   Carry on.   #WorldSeries⁠ ⁠

Lower half, hips, core, glove side upper body all powering the arm through which is essentially along for the ride. Beautiful. (@PitchingNinja) https://t.co/DbYO9n36Fi
It doesn’t matter if baseball is boring to you or not, this is awesome either way. (Baseball is not boring) https://t.co/I3bDbg7nVg
More athletes than you know get positivity &amp; learn life lessons from you and NOBODY else.   Don’t just show up expecting to teach on-field skills and go home.   Be ready to transform lives.   Coaches have an amazing opportunity to reach &amp; teach more people than anyone else.
If you’re human you have limitations.   The great ones aren’t defined by what they cannot do, but by what they have done.  Limitations are speed bumps, not road blocks.   Changing that mindset changes everything.
Most people think the defining moments of their lives are the positive ones. They’re great, don’t get me wrong, but the moments that will stand out in the end of having the greatest impact are those moments where we had to exhibit grit, perseverance, determination, &amp; positivity.
Dirt ball reads are critical. The extra 90 ft can be the difference between a W or L.  Don’t run the bases blindly. Know &amp; understand the situation, read &amp; react when a ball is in the dirt, &amp; know the arm of the catcher.   Sitting back &amp; waiting isn’t the answer. Make it happen.
Mistakes are amplified in the #postseason.  It’s why every detail is covered over &amp; over again when everything isn’t on the line.  Repetition of fundamentals isn’t because athletes don’t know how to do it, it’s because athletes need it to be second nature when it counts the most.
@KevinGausman Wait til kids. Then you’re practically diving at the remote.
@illuminaubrey_ 🔥 love this
Athletes should want to go play somewhere that gives them the best opportunity to grow as people, as athletes, &amp; somewhere they’ll actually play.  Don’t just chase your favorite logo, your parents alma mater, where your friends go, or even a D1 school.  You’ll regret it forever.
Mistakes follow you around for a while, but you’re not defined by them.   Nobody is perfect. Nobody can do it all. Nobody is safe from failure.  Your story can impact many ... not while you’re down ... but when you rise up again.   Don’t give up, don’t lose heart, and don’t quit.
Kershaw was at Fenway ... by himself ... preparing for the #WorldSeries.   You can teach skills but you can’t teach this.   If you want to be the best you have to do things differently than the rest.   https://t.co/GAqSEtoDsJ

Predictions for the #WorldSeries?   I say @RedSox in 6.  #postseason
Psst. Did anyone notice how @Cody_Bellinger running hard down the line extended the inning? That allowed @YasielPuig to hit &amp; could’ve changed the trajectory of the entire season.   He ran hard on a ground ball to 2B.   Never underestimate the power of running hard.   #postseason
I was blessed to play for @csubero in the minor leagues with the @rangers. The @brewers are incredibly fortunate to have a coach who cares more about who you are as a person than who you are as a player. Los knows that relationships come before results.   Go @brewers! #postseason
It’s not what you make, what they call you, or what it looks like.   It’s who you impact &amp; how you impact them.  Everyone has a platform. Each one has a different size, but that doesn’t matter.   Whether it’s 1 or 1,000,000 ... be a positive, uplifting, &amp; selfless leader to them.

Even if today didn’t go the way you wanted, take solace in the fact that it doesn’t define you.   Tomorrow is a new day.
You have no choice in what you hear, but you can absolutely choose what you listen to.  Filter out &amp; let go of that which is negative &amp; brings you down.  Soak up &amp; soak in all that is positive &amp; brings you life.  The choice is yours. Start now.

Why do we so often think that reaching a certain title or status automatically gives us a free pass from doing the little things?  Remember what got you to where you are now.   It wasn’t an entitled attitude, I guarantee you that.   Clean something. Carry something. Help someone.
The world we live in says, do more, get more, have more, &amp; be more.  This is causing more stress, anxiety, &amp; depression than ever before.  How about:   Do what you love, get what you need, have what’s necessary, &amp; be who you were created to be.
Spent some time with the family in the mountains today. Literally a breath of fresh air. Love time with them! https://t.co/tyxT8uCOBv
It’s not about who you were or even who you are.   It’s about who you’re becoming.   Every day and every adversity you face is a chance to grow stronger and wiser.   Don’t run from it. Embrace it &amp; allow it to propel you forward.
@Decker6 @SavedByTheMax That’s awesome!!!
You won’t be remembered by what you accomplished but by who you impacted.
Coaches try so hard to have the most knowledge, the most wins, and the most rings that they end up forgetting about the most important thing there is.   The athlete.   Never value status or achievements over the impact you can have on a person. Wins fade. Impact is generational.
Being successful has a little to do with you, and a lot to do with who you put around you.  Make sure the right people are on your team and in your corner.  Be lifted up by the right people rather than sunk down by the wrong ones or the lie that “going it alone” is the best way.

Leadership comes in many different forms and on many different scales. You don’t have to be “famous” or have lots of “followers” to lead.  Stay at home parents can lead.  A coach of a little league team can lead.  Anyone can lead.   How many you lead is irrelevant. Start with 1.
Coaches try so hard to have all the answers &amp; be in the cutting edge of all the newest things &amp; be the one to win all the games.   These things are great, don’t get me wrong.   But, often, those you’re leading need your positive presence more than anything else in their life.

It’s great to dream. Dreaming big is the foundation of success, because without it we remain unmotivated.   However, there comes a point where we must stop dreaming and start doing.  Too many have the thought, the plan, and the dream, yet never act on it.  Get courageous &amp; start.

It’s easy to wonder until you remember that a hitter is 60 feet 6 inches away from a guy throwing a little white ball who can change speeds &amp; change pitch directions without ever changing arm speed or arm slot. Oh, and it’s a straight up guess with about a split second to decide. https://t.co/DhRHu5BBrM
You cannot teach this. This isn’t on YouTube, or in your coach’s back pocket, or able to be practiced. This is straight up feel &amp; one of this game’s intangibles. To be falling backwards and still have this accuracy and velocity? Wow.   #PostSeason https://t.co/ShFbE8C9tl

October baseball means that guys like Tony Wolters and Scott Oberg are heroes.   It means marathon games &amp; intensity.   There’s nothing like #postseason baseball.   If that was any indication of what this is going to be like, then we’re all in for a real treat.
A catcher’s receiving skills &amp; presentation dictates much of the success a pitcher has.  I get that a pitcher makes the pitch, but the catcher sells it.   There’s minimal difference between a strike and a ball anyways, so having a catcher who can present well is key.  #postseason
Freeland’s leg pause is something that seems insignificant but it’s actually very important.   Hitting is timing.   Leg lift pauses and holds disrupt that timing.   Find an edge, understand how each facet of the game works, &amp; practice whatever you can do to succeed.  #postseason

Athletes should choose workout / throwing partners like you choose friends.   Hang around the wrong ones and you’ll be brought down by their habits.  There’s nothing worse than not achieving success &amp; attaining goals because of something you could’ve easily controlled.  Be smart.

I don’t think we can look at this picture of Bob Gibson &amp; determine that all pitchers should have similar mechanics. Each athlete is individual and their bodies work individually.   While their are some parts that are common, we should hesitate to cookie-cutter everyone we teach. https://t.co/PlF6L6JjFF
Consistency in the mechanics.   Same arm slot/release point.  Many different pitches.  Hitting is hard. Having a pitcher who brings many different pitches from the same window makes it nearly impossible.  https://t.co/vWW1NuWRtM

Most coaches would take selfless, average talent athletes over selfish, very talented athletes any day.   Why?  We &gt; Me is the best way to win a championship.
These @Braves are a fun group to watch. On the verge of a playoff berth/division title &amp; most counted them out before the season even started. Makes this even more fun to witness!

@plattdavid Don’t aim it. Grip it and rip it.
When we look at someone who's successful, remember that it took hard work, sacrifice, &amp; a process to achieve it. It didn't happen overnight.
Coaches want to know why their teams don’t follow their lead ... without realizing they may not be worth following.   If you want to lead them, be intentional about it. Set the example of excellence you want them to follow.

@robgreene Guarantee it would dissuade it.
@robgreene I honestly don’t have a good answer. It is all filtered through a commissioner’s office, intent, situation, rules, player’s union, etc. Each case is always totally different. That was, IMO, a blatant attempt to hit Acuña.
It’s one thing to say you’re a leader &amp; another thing to be a leader.   Leaders aren’t always the loudest, often leading by example alone.   Leaders are consistent in all they do, including work ethic, decisions, &amp; selflessness.   Leaders walk in when everyone else walks out.
@680TheFan @KevinMcAlpin Homer

We forget that coaching is generational. Think about it: a player is going to wear your uniform, be a part of the team, and be in the organization for a few years at the most.   However, the impact we have on them lasts their entire lives and in some ways, beyond!

There are wins &amp; losses. You will win &amp; you will lose.  However, losses can be learning experiences if you let them. Losing hurts. Losing is no fun. However, losing will let you learn things about yourself you may never otherwise learn.  The next time you lose, don’t pout. Learn.
@D_Geiger @FMRedHawks Ask the manager nicely.

Who you’re becoming is shaped by who you are when times are tough. We all want to be strong, confident, &amp; exude leadership qualities.   The truth is, without adversity, none of these qualities can truly be developed.   Don’t run from tough situations &amp; adversity, embrace them.
Really happy for one of our LHP Sebastian Kessay. His contract was purchased by the @Dbacks today. All of the @FMRedHawks family wishes you the very best! https://t.co/q7Ha7KNjwY
@JaerodH Yeah that was rough. Glad it worked out!
Thanks Metzger. Really throwing me under the bus here. @FMRedHawks https://t.co/UnVFKRQVb7

Love this advice from Jim Thome. When a Hall of Famer speaks about baseball, we should probably listen.  https://t.co/db85uXEaka
We will never achieve greatness without facing adversity.  Those who have achieved greatness learned that working through setbacks and failures &amp; learning from them rather than being defined by them made all the difference in the end.  Embrace the adversity &amp; learn the lesson.
@BenjBowman @RonPopeMusic @Newportfolkfest @ugafan618 He's going down to GA and I can't stop him. He knows where his roots are.
A very happy 38th wedding anniversary to my parents. My dad says, “It’s simple. I married my best friend. We’d rather hang out with each other than anyone else. We laugh together, we eat together, and we give thanks for our blessings together.”  Love you, mom &amp; dad
It may be easier to think about &amp; focus on all that's going wrong, but it's not productive or good for you.  Every day, think about &amp; focus on the blessings in your life &amp; all that you have to be thankful for ... no matter how big or small.  A positive mindset is a necessity.
In order to achieve greatness, of course you must dream big. However, dreaming big isn’t all you should do.  Those who achieve greatness don’t just sit around and dream about it happening. They get up, get to work, and make it happen.
I was blessed to have a small part in the journey of @caseymweathers and to get to know him on a personal level. Proud of you, Casey. https://t.co/smWNIVRfdx

We have a choice every day:   - to allow our fears and setbacks to define &amp; hinder us  or  - to use adversity as fuel to grow &amp; move ahead more wisely.
Who you were will be remembered much longer than what you did.

@RonPopeMusic @RonFunches What a moment. Forever changed the way I order (and follow directions).
When most people see road blocks, champions see walls to climb.   When most people see failures, champions see growth.   When most people see dead ends, champions see detours.  When most people see a loss, champions see a lesson.
6 runs in the 9th to win a game today. If you’ve been around these guys any amount of time, that doesn’t surprise you. There’s no quit, no negativity, and no excuses.   Resiliency. Heart. Grit. Fight. Passion.   I love this team.  @FMRedHawks  @chriscoste27  @atrenz10
It’s not that those who are successful never lose.   Those who are successful learn from losses &amp; move ahead more wisely.  Everyone faces adversity. Those who achieve greatness are motivated by setbacks rather than defined by them.   Learn a lesson. Bounce back. Move on.
It’s amazing what can happen when you don’t give up. Most of the time, things aren’t completed or success isn’t attained because it takes too long or seems too tough.  Bear down, dig in, and persevere.
@chriscoste27 #GoodDayToHit #LookAtThoseFlags
Who you are and what you’re made of are defined when times are tough, not when everything is going your way.  Anyone can be positive &amp; work hard when things are easy. True success &amp; great character are built when you face adversity head on &amp; learn from it.
The best thing you’ll see today.  https://t.co/s7B3mt5Auu
Happy 4th of July from some of your @FMRedHawks. https://t.co/VnaEbAl0br
Things won’t always go your way &amp; things won’t always work out. Those who achieve greatness are those who are fueled by adversity &amp; motivated by naysayers.   Don’t focus on the problem, figure out a solution.
Congrats to a great family! Proud of AJ! https://t.co/C9fbUufAL1
Rarely do we grow and rarely does our character truly develop when things are going well. We should absolutely enjoy those times. However, true growth happens when adversity strikes. It's a little about what happens to you and a lot about how you react to what happens to you.
How sad is this? https://t.co/mUqq7OFIb9

@ChristianL5 Love it!!!
My opinion on soccer:  Flopping should result in an automatic yellow. Then, the flopper should be removed from the game for 5 minutes to “recover” from his obviously traumatic experience.   A second flop? Gone for the game. Because, it appears they need serious medical treatment.
Being a leader doesn’t mean you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a certain title, or a certain lifestyle.  Being a leader means you walk in when others walk out &amp; you help those around you be their best.  Being a leader means giving up the right to put yourself first.
It's one thing to not allow a coach to scream at you. It's another to completely avoid accountability. If you miss a call, admit it and get better. Tough watching an ump avoid any questioning in a HUGE spot.
So NCAA umpires can call whatever they want and not "allow" coaches to even discuss it? C'mon. Ball 4 in a monster spot for @BeaverBaseball and umpire won't even let Pat Casey ask him about it?
A little rain makes all baseball players instantly become professional meteorologists.
It takes daily drive, dedication, and determination to become successful at something.  It’s never enough to hope for success, dream about success, or talk about success without ever actually working towards it.  Dream about it but then work for it.
I’m a very lucky guy. My wonderful wife blessed me with two amazing boys. This was the best Father’s Day yet! There’s nothing like running the bases after the game &amp; enjoying some family time! https://t.co/5pduHsLwdr
Congrats &amp; well deserved! An amazing family! https://t.co/om8UoZlZct
This umpire was so fired up to call strike 3 he punched the catcher in the back of the head. If you’re going to do it, do it 100%.  https://t.co/qLgTUuJWnO
Congratulations to @StPaulSaints manager George Tsamis on win # 1000. An amazing accomplishment. Tip of the cap to that milestone.
Leaders step up when everyone else wants to sit down.   You don’t have to be vocal.   You just have to be willing.   Lead with words. Lead by example. Lead with humbleness &amp; humility.   Step up. Step out. Step in.
Mistakes happen. That’s not what defines you. Nobody is perfect.  What matters is how you react, what you learn, &amp; how you proceed. Learn the lesson &amp; grow.

Best of luck to all those @MLBDraft hopefuls. 14 years ago my name was called by the @Rangers &amp; it changed my life forever.   However, if you don’t get drafted it doesn’t mean your dream is over. Keep fighting &amp; never give up. You never know.
The best thing we can do is fight til the very end. The truth is, we don’t know what the outcome will be. But, regret sets in whenever we fall short but wish we’d given more.  Give 100% every minute of every day. Those who achieve greatness never give in &amp; never give up.

Today, and every day, we honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice so that we could be free, safe, &amp; live in the greatest country in the world. Thank you for your service, your sacrifice, &amp; your selflessness.   #MemorialDay
A pathway to success is resiliency. Everyone will face adversity along the way.  It’s not necessarily what happens to you, but how you respond to what happens to you.  Winners recognize that failure and adversity are fuel to the fire, not an extinguisher.
We don’t necessarily improve when things are easy.   We improve the most when we face adversity head on &amp; take each moment as a lesson.   The strongest steel is forged in the hottest fire.
We’re headed home! Can’t wait to see the @FMRedHawks fans on Opening Night Friday at Newman Outdoor Field! https://t.co/V4rPRMeFjW

Our character isn’t revealed in times when everything is going our way. Anyone can exhibit confidence, positivity, faith, &amp; selflessness in those times.  Our character is revealed when times are tough. Who we are &amp; what we stand for become exposed quickly.  Who are you?
We won the game, which is good. But, Rafael Palmeiro did play against us at 53 years old and he hit a homer. https://t.co/RuIcAX6RFU
Losing is part of life. We simply cannot win at everything we do.  The key, however, is to take each loss as a lesson.   There is no such thing as winning and losing, only winning and learning.
This is just another reason why the @FMRedHawks have the best bus driver in the world. Problem? He’ll fix it. https://t.co/KHJBR8Xaxy

If you’re going to go for it, you might as well give it all you’ve got.   Most of the world does exactly what’s needed to just get by. In order to achieve greatness, you must go the extra mile.  It’s not always easy. It’s not always popular. It’s always worth it.
Last night was my first as manager without “interim” tag. Thankful to have the opportunity, but I’m more thankful for the support of those around me. I’m blessed by a wonderful family, a great staff, &amp; some remarkable players. This @fmredhawks season is going to be a fun ride. https://t.co/MsPjGwpXcu

There is a big difference between being a coach and being a leader.  A coach will make an impact during the season. Then, everyone moves on.   A leader makes an impact during the season but also makes an impact that lasts a lifetime.  Coaches tell you how. Leaders walk with you.

To hear from someone who has just realized their dream of playing in the major leagues after 17 years in the minors &amp; indy ball that “you were a huge part of the process” makes what I do completely worth it.  When you coach, it’s not about you. Your idea of success should shift.

I would like to wish a very special Happy Mother’s Day to my beautiful wife. These two boys are so lucky to have a mama like her. She’s selfless, caring, loving, patient, &amp; fun.

Becoming a leader doesn’t mean you get to be selfish &amp; focus more on yourself &amp; your agenda.   Becoming a leader means you get to be selfless &amp; focus more on other people.   The best leaders are those who can humble themselves enough to serve others regardless of position/title.
Thankful for my position, my platform, and the opportunity. We have a great group of men here with lots of talent &amp; high character. Couldn't be more excited to start this journey with them. Go @FMRedHawks.   (photo: @dlemoal1) https://t.co/WRI0c4qEiZ

Success over the course of an entire season can be achieved by doing the little things right every single day.   Rarely do you have success or rarely do you fail based off what happened at the very end.  Daily drive &amp; determination mixed with commitment &amp; character determine it.
Thanks, @Twitter. I feel better &amp; can move on with my day knowing this. https://t.co/sCAoZTfjKb
Adversity is a dead end to the mentally weak.   Adversity is merely a detour to the mentally strong.  Don’t give in and don’t give up.
Strive to be the type of leader who lets everyone know that everyone is important, regardless of role or title.   Everyone, every day, plays a part in accomplishing something special.

@CraigHarmann @PitchingNinja The physical ability that it takes to throw a ball that hard is beyond comprehension, not something that should be shrugged off. If you see triple digits you are witnessing a miracle of human physiology.

An overnight success is someone who most likely became known to you overnight.  However, the work, drive, determination, hunger, blood, sweat, tears, sacrifice, and perseverance necessary to become successful likely was years and years in the making.

It seems like forever when we're in the thick of it, but when we look back we realize it was over in a flash.   Enjoy &amp; embrace each second.
The biggest thief of confidence &amp; success is a doubting mindset. When you show up &amp; believe the opponent is better, you’re already losing regardless of what a scoreboard says.  Putting work in &amp; overcoming adversity helps us gain confidence. Gaining confidence keeps us competing.
This is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. https://t.co/rp6tY4bDH9
That @JustinVerlander &amp; Bartolo duel was a wonderful reminder that there isn’t just one way to be successful as a pitcher.   The first pitch strikes &amp; command of the baseball was the same, but the velocity was completely different.   Embrace your strengths.

As a coach, I would take talented &amp; great people plus selfless attitudes over exceptional talent &amp; selfish attitudes any day of the week.
Big game players weren’t just handed that opportunity. They showed the coach that, in the little things, they could be trusted.  Over time that led to bigger opportunities. Wherever you are, work hard &amp; prove you can. From there, watch your platform increase.
I guarantee you whatever postgame interview you have isn’t as good as Cincinnati Bearcats Baseball.  https://t.co/FpPkqypafY

Really happy for you, @tylerbeede. Big things ahead! https://t.co/cuNMy8uV4l
The easy thing to do when things don't go your way is complain about them. That's ordinary.  Those who achieve greatness take things that don't go their way &amp; use them as fuel.  Adversity becomes that which propels them closer to success because of mindset, perseverance, &amp; faith.
Disclaimer: I realize it’s 100 mph. Hang with me here.   This pitch works there, it works in the minors. It works in college, high school, and 9 year old little league baseball.  That location &amp; command of the fastball works from the bottom to the top. https://t.co/vMOKSZm4x5

Having a championship mindset means you’re humbled &amp; thankful for the success, but you’re motivated and fueled by the failures.  You aren’t defined by what you were, but by what you are becoming.  A championship mindset is rare, but there’s only one champion.
I love the way Adrian Beltre plays baseball. Passion, fun, fire, competitiveness, and love.   He recognizes what it takes to be a pro but never forgot what it was like to be a kid playing the game he loves.  #TexasRangers
The best know that the best way to win is to have confidence &amp; play relaxed.  Confidence comes from preparation. Preparation comes from doing little things right &amp; building a solid foundation long before the season starts.  Playing relaxed comes from knowing you did these things.

Nobody achieved success without failure.  Nobody achieved a comeback without a setback.  Nobody achieved greatness without inadequacy.  There is a lesson to be learned from tough times. Don't give up and don't give in.
Championship Traits  - Selflessness - Perseverance - Heart - Hustle - Grit - Excellence - Determination - Courage  Champions aren’t born, they’re made. It’s time to step up &amp; realize no one can do it for you. If you want to be the best, you must forge ahead and make it happen.

A championship team finds a way &amp; then makes a way even when there appears to be no way.  A championship team silences the voices of even the loudest critics by the way they work, act, &amp; play.  A championship team understands that it's not always how you start but how you finish.
@PitchingNinja @BauerOutage with the "I'm not mad, I'm disappointed" dad look.
When you step on the field, your mindset should be “I know I can” over “I hope I can.” Doubt stems from unpreparedness, a feeling of unworthiness, &amp; being scared to fail. Work hard, have a plan, know you’re on the team for a reason, embrace your role, &amp; remember nobody’s perfect.
I’m not quite sure what your excuse is, but please watch this catcher &amp; then never use it again. You can find a way if you really want to.  https://t.co/DjJdLppva9

I’ve seen many succeed that others didn’t think would because of character, work ethic &amp; discipline.   I’ve seen many fail that others  didn’t think would because of a lack of character, work ethic, &amp;  discipline.
You’ll know you’re a part of a championship program when you leave every day better than when you got there.   Winners help those around them for the benefit of the whole team.  It’s not about the individual success. It’s about the collective success.
A championship team has a group of players who:  Feel like family. Fight for each other. Form an unshakeable bond. Fix their mistakes immediately. Flip negatives into positives. Fail with class &amp; learn from it. Forge through adversity.
Big games are won by everyone doing little things correctly and consistently.   These little things are introduced, worked on, and mastered in practice. However, most athletes hate working on little things in practice.  Remember, the simplest skills win ... or lose games.
Vlad Jr.  Montreal.  Baseball is the best. https://t.co/sPh5utSyk8
Championship athletes recognize that winning on the field doesn’t just happen.   You must take care of business on the field, but you must take care of business off it too.  Eat right, sleep well, and always survey who you surround yourself with. It’s a collective effort.

Coaches like talent, but what they really hope for in players is character.  Some of the most talented never make it due to a lack of work ethic, heart, hustle, &amp; grit.  Some of the less talented make it because of work ethic, heart, hustle, &amp; grit.  Control what you can control.

It's usually not the big home run that's the sole reason a team wins a game. Sure, it helps. What led to that point?   If you watch from inning 1 to inning 9, teams that win games:  -Make all the plays. -Don't give away free bases. -Throw strikes consistently. -Run bases well.
Let me just say this: you don’t know strength until you’ve watched a woman give birth to a child. @jillian_schlact is stronger than I’ll ever be. That’s a fact.
The best don't always think so highly of themselves that they can't see their faults.  The best understand that an honest self-evaluation of their faults is critical to improvement.  Perfection is impossible. Humility is necessary. Honesty is imperative. Improvement is essential.
Doesn’t get much better than this. Love my little dude. https://t.co/mkAnSrG9Ns
If you’re not getting playing time you want, don’t get bitter ... get better.  You still have opportunities to show your coach what you can do, because you still have a uniform to wear.  You still have practice. You still have off-field decisions. Teammate interactions.  C’mon.

The average person accepts no for an answer.  A winner isn’t satisfied.  The average person gives up when times get tough.  A winner finds a way through.  The average person is ok being ordinary.  A winner puts the extra in extraordinary.  Don’t settle for average. Be a winner.

Thank y’all for the kind words. Means so much to us. @jillian_schlact is now surrounded by boys in the house, but she’s amazing. Blessed to stand alongside her and raise them together. Sawyer &amp; Sutton are two lucky boys to have a mama like her.
Welcome to the world, Sutton Dakota. 3/20/18 at 6:30 pm  Mama and Baby are doing wonderfully! https://t.co/ztSY0moM55
Want to know how to improve? Read below. The hardest thing to do is be so honest with yourself that you realize a critical self-evaluation is necessary. Lincecum could’ve taken it in for the day. Instead, he sought out the guy who hit him hard &amp; used it as a chance to grow. https://t.co/uUYCjYXQj1
. @jillian_schlact’s pace of play is horrid. Maybe they should limit the nurse visits &amp; put a labor clock in the room. C’mon honey.
. @jillian_schlact &amp; I have arrived at the hospital &amp; we’re excited to welcome our newest addition at some point in the near future. Prayers for the doctors, nurses, my wife, and our baby! Thank you!
I can solve this international mystery. It was one of my sliders that didn’t slide. You’re welcome. https://t.co/5CDPEunDO1
Wow! A must watch!  Athletes are afraid to fail. Athletes should be encouraged to take risks.   Screaming and yelling at them when they mess up is counterproductive. You yell, then wonder why you can’t get the most out of them later.   Watch this: https://t.co/NMpw7CJIUn
Somehow, athlete entitlement has made its way all the way to kids in elementary school.  Just because you play travel ball, you play in HS, or you think you’re the best on your team, it doesn’t mean you’re exempt from the helping.  Rake, pull a tarp, etc.  It’s your team too.
Every minor league spring training game, various minor league guys have jobs. Radar gun, chart, foul balls, ball/bat boy.   You are not too good for these things. Think twice before the entitlement sets in that allows you to think otherwise.   If pros can, you can. https://t.co/T9G3QnIvx1
This is unbelievable.   Listen to this take on parents coaching from the stands, getting on to refs/umps, etc.   A must listen. “I’m not your coach, go talk to your coach.”  https://t.co/ndHEbxXVkQ
You won't always like your coaches.   The worst thing you can do is complain about it.  The best thing you can do is deal with it.  In life, there's people in positions of leadership that you'll disagree with or won't get along with.  Winners learn to look past it &amp; keep working.
The toughest opponents we face aren’t always ones who are the most talented.  The toughest opponents we face are the ones who simply just won’t go away.  What can we learn from this?  Talent can take you there, but determination, fight, grit, heart, &amp; hustle will keep you there.
Excuses are for those who don’t have the courage to admit defeat, the perseverance to keep fighting, or the work ethic to get better.  Excuses ruin more athletes than anything else because it’s infectious. It spreads from one athlete to the next until a team is wiped out.
What does it mean to be coachable?  It means you realize you don’t know it all.  It means you realize there’s always room to improve.  It means you realize a coach has been where you are &amp; you’re open to new info.  It means you realize that in order to be your best you need help.
Bad body language is a momentum killer.   An error or a mistake is going to happen. Knowing that you have teammates who will pick you up when it happens is what prevents the error or mistake from snowballing.   There’s nothing worse than messing up &amp; having teammates show you up.
Winning teams are never satisfied.  There is a hunger for more when the team is winning.  There is a hunger for redemption when the team is losing.  Winning teams realize there’s no time for gloating when you’re on top of the mountain because you could quickly be in the valley.
A winning team looks ahead and moves forward TOGETHER.  If you're looking back or hesitant to get going, you'll get left behind.  A winning team needs everyone on board, regardless of the role.  Embrace who you are, what you do, and how you contribute to your team.
@joelesimpson @MontreatCavBase Thanks for the kind words.
See you there, @littlecaesars. https://t.co/B0U1u8QbZf
Line of sight &amp; visual of mitt by @JArrieta34. Early, open, low target by the catcher. The foundation is set for a quality pitch.   Pitchers: you need to see where you’re going.  Catchers: Take pride in your presentation. It helps the pitcher, but also the umpire.   #STdrills https://t.co/z1iuOP9hjP
This is a wonderful example of leadership, humility, &amp; honesty. You cannot be defined by what you do, because it’s not who you are. https://t.co/s5BNlFHxPH
You may be up early when everyone else is sleeping.  It may be cold. It may be dark. It may seem crazy.  It may be a sacrifice now, but you’ll be glad you did it later.  Success doesn’t come easily. Dreams aren’t handed to you. Thousands want what you have.  If you want it, work.
It doesn’t matter who has the most wins, who’s OBP is the highest, who has the most home runs, who makes the least errors, who leads the team in assists, or who has the most saves.  When you’re on the field, you have a job ... your job ... to do. Your team is counting on you.
It’s not that champions never lose, it’s that champions refuse to be defined by &amp; rarely dwell on losing.  Adversity isn’t a stumbling block to winners, it’s a stepping stone to success.
3 second recap of tonight’s @UMBCAthletics vs @UVAMensHoops game. #MarchMadness https://t.co/KSr8QQLZE2
@jasoncollette @PitchingNinja I was a swim-mover a bit myself. Figured out in order to not completely lose my momentum towards home I needed to almost hunch a bit to stay balanced and have a stronger "base." Helped some. Seems to be what he's doing a bit.
If you've ever watched somebody succeed at something and wondered how, there's a good chance it's because of the work they put in when you weren't watching them.  Those who succeed under the bright lights do so because of preparation away from them.
@PitchingNinja @jasoncollette it's like the glove "swim move" is something he won't eliminate so rather than allowing it to pull him way off line, he hunches the shoulders a bit to counter it. Edwin Physicist Diaz.
Pitchers:  Make every pitch a purpose pitch. You may be trying to throw it low &amp; outside ... but you may miss up &amp; in. So?  Watch the hitter's reaction &amp; plan accordingly for the next pitch.  If we can take a mistake and make it useful, the game ... &amp; your mindset ... will shift.
@jasoncollette @PitchingNinja seems to be a mechanical cue he uses throughout delivery to keep himself on target/closed/whatever term you use. Some guys realize they have some upper half issues they need to be proactive about throughout delivery ... wonder if that's part of it.
You’ll hear it time and time again from a team who just won a championship:  “We didn’t have the most talented team. But, we had a team that worked hard, overcame adversity, had a vision, cared for each other, &amp; fought til the end.”  Character can carry you further than talent.
What I’ve learned from my failures:  1) It’s not the end of the story, it’s just the beginning of a new one.   2) They don’t define me.   3) It’s not a dead end. It’s a detour, a u-turn, or a speed bump. Don’t lose heart.
Selfishness infects a team, because one person with negativity, one person who decides not to work hard, one person who makes a bad off-field choice, or one person who doesn’t buy in to the culture is one person too many.   It takes one to bring down many.   Winners are selfless.
Too many runners advance a base NOT because of the catcher, but because of the pitcher’s inability to mix up looks, change up tempo, and slide step.   Holding runners is much more than just having a decent pick off move.   Know the base runner.  Know your tendencies. Change them.
@TheGrandOldGame @Sports_Spectrum Thanks so much.
@davidcsalinas1 @Matt_Baseball10 Social media &amp; “online coaches” complicate this too, because everyone thinks the more they say the more they know. Not always the case.
@TroyPSilva Players play. Players recognize it’s about the opportunity over the offer. Players recognize it’s a blessing to wear a uniform &amp; that thousands would trade places in a heartbeat. Players know &amp; understand that if you have a spot you have a chance. Focus on the why, not the where.
You will never realize your full potential if you're consistently fearing failure.  You'll never know what you're truly made of until you step out in faith.  Decide today that the prospect of success far outweighs the risk of failing.
Championship programs:  1) They win &amp; lose with class. 2) They expect excellence daily. 3) They believe in themselves. 4) They never doubt. 5) They learn from losses. 6) They respect leadership. 7) They dream big. 8) They work hard. 9) They never give up. 10) They are selfless.
The ump asked the hitter to hit one to RF to see if it was too foggy to play. I’m telling you right now, if that was me, I would’ve whiffed, dropped the bat, walked off the field, and gone home. My career would’ve ended right there in that batter’s box. https://t.co/ixXigpPR21
Many times, winning a game revolves around one thing.   Eliminate free bases.  The more we cut down on allowing free bases, the more runs we’ll save. The more runs we save, the more games we’ll win.  Over the course of a season, it’s scary to see how less free bases = more wins.
You’re never too good for the fundamentals.   New players need to build their foundation on them.   Veteran players need to stay fresh with them.  Everyone needs to know them.   Games are won ... and lost ... by teams that either do the small things right or not.   Master them.
I wrote this week’s “Over The Hump” devotional for @nsckennesaw. Hope you’ll read it, be encouraged by it, &amp; sign up for it to be sent directly in your inbox each Wednesday.  https://t.co/LMJcH7COEz
I care about talent as a coach, but I really care about commitment. Lots of athletes can play the game. It’s important.   There’s a much smaller percentage that have what it takes to be committed to we &gt; me daily.
A house with a strong foundation will not be brought down easily.   What is your foundation built upon?  A foundation of fear is like sand on a beach. It’s okay until the waves come.   A foundation of faith is like strong steel. It takes a lot to damage it.  Faith &gt; Fear
Looking back at my coaches over the years, I quickly realize the ones who were hardest on me also cared the most about me.   Expecting excellence from someone &amp; holding them to a high standard may rub them the wrong way.  Those who truly care won’t let you take the easy way out.
Winning players don't wait to train for crunch time in the midst of crunch time.  Discipline is formed &amp; strength is built long before the bright lights turn on.  Winning players know &amp; understand that to be successful, championships are trained for before the season even starts.
Be prepared. This means knowing what your opponent does well &amp; what their weaknesses are.  However, another aspect of preparedness is knowing what YOU do well.   Don't become so focused on the opponent that you forget what you can do.   Your strengths trump their weaknesses.
You wouldn’t drive blindfolded.   You need vision.  The same goes for life.  If you want to determine your direction, have a vision. Plan the process step by step &amp; know your route before you floor it.   If you hit a dead end, realign your vision, turn around, &amp; go again.
Thank you so much to everyone for your kind words for my family and me. It means so much. They mean more than you’ll ever know.
Welcome to the @FMRedHawks family, Brennan Metzger. Excited to have such a versatile player &amp; a leader with a championship mindset joining our team. https://t.co/VaiPmg3qTb https://t.co/Xr3ckq0EAf
None of us know what tomorrow holds. I encourage everyone to let their loved ones know how much they mean to you.   In an instant, things change. Make sure, while you have the chance, to hug those who you care for &amp; let them know how you feel.  In the end, you’ll be glad you did.
My grandmother passed away tonight. She leaves a legacy of love, joy, &amp; optimism that is unmatched.   She loved others selflessly, found the positive in everything, &amp; was joyful through anything. She also served as a nurse in the Army.  My heart hurts badly. I miss her already.
If you wouldn’t mind saying a prayer for my family ... my grandmother has been fighting cancer &amp; we’re right on the last leg of the fight.   I pray that the legacy of love she leaves permeates everybody I ever encounter &amp; the legacy of optimism brightens even the darkest days.
Warren Buffet lives in the same house he bought 50+ years ago. This is a wonderful lesson in being both content with what you have &amp; financially smart regardless of net worth.   The bottom line: discipline is important in every aspect of our lives.   Focus on what truly matters.
I love this. Way to go, @Orioles. The best way to get the next generation involved in the game is to get them to the game. https://t.co/aVjtIfDVVp
Thankful to @Sports_Spectrum for allowing me the opportunity to write a season long diary of what it’s like to be a manager in professional baseball. Hope you’ll follow along with me on my journey with the @FMRedHawks.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL
Thankful to be a part. Amazing group of guys. https://t.co/Td5zjvPweF
I am blessed &amp; thankful for the opportunities &amp; platform that God has given me. Thanks to @Sports_Spectrum &amp; @HodgySpeaks for the nice article. Hope you’ll read it &amp; share it.  https://t.co/BEUhjjEuiG
Championship teams fight for each other.  Championship teams don’t accept mediocrity.  Championship teams do little things right daily.  Championship teams accept constructive criticism well.  Championship teams win &amp; lose with class.  Championship teams don’t fear the opponent.
A person with average talent who displays a daily dedication to the team is more impressive than someone with a lot of talent but is only in it for themselves.  One helps a team &amp; one hinders a team.  You will improve when you ask how you can help the team improve.
Pitchers can’t blame catchers for everything. At some point, you have to grow up &amp; take responsibility.  Yes, the catcher puts down the sign, but you have the ability to shake off.  Yes, the catcher has to throw a runner out, but you have to mix looks &amp; be quick to home.  Own it.
@PitchingNinja ...because when it counts, that same pitch could cost your team a season. Expect excellence.
We have a choice: to let failure define us or to let failure realign us. Each setback can be learned from. The turning point on our path to greatness is when a bad situation doesn’t derail us, but it causes us to pause, think, learn, grow, &amp; move on more wisely than ever before.
One of the biggest hindrances to an athlete's improvement isn't a lack of ability or talent. It's a lack of coachability.  The best coaches in the world can't help someone that isn't interested in learning.  There's never a time in life when we've mastered it all. Be coachable.
This is, without a doubt, the best definition of “team” that I’ve ever seen. They are more than teammates ... they are brothers. When we &gt; me is the focus of the team, big things happen on the field &amp; lives are changed off it.   Amazing. https://t.co/Zaog5mEoC1
Your coaches and teammates deserve your best every single day. Championship teams are made up of selfless people.  Your best doesn't just mean on the field, because often, off the field decisions and actions are just as important.  Take care of yourself in every aspect of life.
Play hard.   Every pitch. Every out. Every inning. Every game. Every day.  We don’t know when our chance may come, so we might as well give it all we’ve got every single day.   It’s easier to not make it from lack of talent than it is from lack of effort. I promise.
Nice play, @White_Mamba25_. Can we all acknowledge the umpire falling straight down and still having the wherewithal to call him out? https://t.co/lSaODnqzYo
Winners are positive.  Winners are hard workers. Winners are selfless. Winners don’t complain. Winners learn from failure. Winners stay humble.  Winners make others better.
A baby learns to walk one step at a time.  A kid learns math one step at a time.  Success is achieved one step at a time.  There’s a big misconception that success will just happen. Not true.  Success is the daily drive &amp; determination built over years of planning &amp; perseverance.
A great team will hold you accountable for your actions &amp; words.  If you mess up, admit it &amp; fix it.   If you say it, back it up.     A great team is like family. Many different people who share a common  goal &amp; who come together when it matters most to achieve something  great.
What is easy isn’t always worth it.   What is worth it isn’t always easy.   The point? Don’t give in and don’t give up. You may feel like it’s hopeless, not worth it, or too much trouble.   In the end, those who achieve greatness overcame adversity, failure, and pushed through.
It's really easy to complain about practice, complain about coaches, complain about teammates, complain about field conditions, &amp; complain about weather.  Winners don't complain. Winners find the best out of every situation. If there isn't a best, they make a best.   Be a winner.
The problem isn’t curveballs as much as it is overuse.  Have a pitch count, have a plan, &amp; have a rest.   Kids are not going pro at 8, 10, or 13, but you could prevent them from an opportunity down the road with careless throwing &amp; lack of planning.
Teaching an athlete one way to do it is what I refer to as cookie cutter coaching. This tells me the coach may only know one way to do it.   Athletes learn a number of different ways. If you want to effectively teach them, you must effectively learn who they are &amp; why they play.
Outfielders shouldn’t be concerned with showing arm strength from the wall to home. It’s not about you.  Hit a cutoff. Knowing the game &amp; situation is more important than a “cannon.”  Too many games are lost because a selfish player is trying to show off &amp; allows an extra base.
I didn’t learn from success. If anything, I learned from failures &amp; setbacks.   It’s easy to be positive, thankful, &amp; happy when things are going your way. Who you truly are, though, is how you are when times get tough.  Though it’s not easy, you’ll learn lessons from losses.
If you lose a game because the other team was better than you, that’s acceptable.   If you lose a game because the other team outworked you, that’s not acceptable.   Control the controllables. Work hard, be a pro on &amp; off the field, &amp; commit to becoming the best you can be.
You step onto the field at a serious disadvantage when you step onto the field doubting your abilities.   The truth is, even those who are less talented can beat those who are more talented with some heart, hustle, and grit.   Never underestimate the power of confidence &amp; faith.
Never https://t.co/aHmpxIbLU6
The best players are also the most selfless. They recognize that, in order for the team to win, they have to give up some things.  Move a runner over, hit a sac fly, bunt, come in for one hitter, etc.   Without a WE &gt; ME mentality, big things can’t happen.
Coaches want to know why they can’t get the most out of players seconds after screaming at them for not doing something correctly.  It’s a proven fact that humans cannot succeed as easily under pressure.  Always remember how hard the game was to play before opening your mouth.
When you wake up every day, remind yourself that you now have another chance.   You can choose your attitude.  You can choose your outlook.  You can choose your friends.  You can choose your path.   Starting now, take control.
Practice ... makes ... perfeOHHHH. https://t.co/bIDj38aAu1
I’ve been in professional baseball 13+ years now, and the recipe for success hasn’t changed one bit.   Those who succeed do so with an unrelenting faith, an unmatched work ethic, an unbelievable passion, unreal grit, an unassuming humbleness, and an unequivocal love for the game.
Baseball is an interesting game.   It’s extremely results-oriented, but in order to get results you have to be extremely process-oriented.  Results don’t just happen. Putting in work every single day while honestly self-evaluating as you make progress is the best way to go.
If you hit a ball that’s a “sure out,” remember two things:  1) Always run it out. Anything can happen. It’d be bad to run half speed &amp; still be out when you could’ve been safe. Too many games are lost that way.   2) Running it out is professional. Take pride in what you do.
Team building should be an integral part of every coach's arsenal. Why?  -Teams that know each other OFF the field will gel ON it. -Teams that show up &amp; play as individuals will never succeed.  Make it a priority. Create a family feel around the team to get the most out of it!
A fear of failure will hold you back.  When you put that uniform on, you’re doing what thousands wish they could do.  Instead of wondering what’ll happen if you fail, start thinking about what could happen if you succeed.  Too many never reach their full potential due to fear.
Most point to the loss as the turning point in the entire season. I turn to the next game.  How did you handle the loss? Did it snowball on you? Did you get negative? Did you give up?  Losing isn't the point where everything goes downhill, the next day is.  Stay positive &amp; fight.
Baseball taught me:  1) to stay humble when it’s going well &amp; to stay positive when it’s not.  2) regardless of where you come from or who you are, perseverance, hard work, &amp; hustle gives you a shot.  3) it’s not failure that defines you but how you react to failure that matters.
Showing up to the ballpark already thinking that the other team is better than you has basically given you an L before you even stepped foot on the field.   It shouldn’t matter who they are or what their record is.   Heart and hustle go a long way. Hard work &amp; grit can carry you.
Losing is part of life. Regardless of what others say, you will lose &amp; it will make you better.  When you lose:  1) Treat it as a lesson. What can you learn from it?  2) Exhibit class and sportsmanship. It won't be the last time it happens.    3) Use it as fuel for the next game.
Scouts &amp; evaluators aren’t interested in your perfection.   They are, however, interested in how you respond from your imperfections.   Many things aren’t controllable. Body language &amp; attitude are completely controllable. Focus on those things &amp; you’ll grow your character a lot.
@JobesJacobe Don’t approach it like you know more (even if you do) or that you’re mad. Try to have a civil conversation about why you disagree and hear his out. When you keep it two sided and civil, good things come from it. Issues arise when one side goes on the attack.
9 out of 10 times, the culture of your organization or team isn't altered when you win, but when you lose.   The reason is simple. More people will buy in or jump ship depending on how you handle adversity &amp; whether or not you lead them through or throw them out.
Parents of athletes:  - Let your kid fight their own battle. Issues should be handled without parent intervention. Teach them to act like grown ups.  - Don’t yell at their coach in front of them. It teaches them to disrespect authority.  - They’re already coached. Just love them.
The best teams know everything about each other.   The best teams get along on &amp; off the field.   The best teams feel like family.   The best teams want the best for each other.   The best teams support each other win or lose.   The best teams expect excellence every single day.
My grandmother has cancer &amp; is barely hanging on. She’s strong, positive, &amp; a big influence in my life.   She told me it’s amazing how fast life flies by. She said to not worry about the small stuff, give thanks for blessings, &amp; enjoy every single second. I plan to do just that.
You will face adversity.  It’s not adversity that will define you.   It’s how you handle adversity that will define you.  Adversity teaches you about yourself, teaches others about you, and shows everyone what it looks like to walk through fire and come out stronger.
Championship programs:  - send people out much better than when they came in.  - promote the family feel where everyone matters.  - expect excellence &amp; eliminate excuses.  - promote winning &amp; learn through losing.  - do the little things correctly every single day.
@PitchingNinja load, load, load, explode.
Amazing things could happen if we would shift our mindset from the moment we wake up every day til the moment we lay our head on the pillow every night.   Instead of immediately focusing on all the negative, wake up &amp; give thanks for the blessings in your life. Try it. It works.
Being able to stare failure in the face &amp; take a leap of faith is what true strength is all about.   Too many people play it safe. Too many people make excuses for why it won’t work.   If you’re afraid of failing you’ll never take off the training wheels.  Go for it.
Far too often I hear excuses about why someone can’t do something. “Can’t” shouldn’t be in your dictionary.   If you want to achieve greatness, dream big ... work hard ... and overcome obstacles.   Someone will ... why not you?
During adversity:  1) recognize it as a detour, not a dead end.   2) remember to keep moving forward.   3) rekindle the positivity that you built up in the good times &amp; use it as you persevere through the tough ones.   4) remind yourself that your example will encourage others.
If you want to win big games then you’ve got to do the little things right.   More times than not a game’s outcome is determined by whether or not you got that bunt down, moved that runner over, made that pitch, fielded that ball, made that throw, etc.   Master the little things.
You either put work in or you didn’t. It doesn’t matter how you spin it, what you say, or what others think.   The truth will come out on the field. Those who work hard off the field will enjoy success on it.   You’re never a finished product. Sitting around does no one any good.
It’s one thing to respect the talent of another player.   It’s another thing to play scared because you’re afraid the other player will beat you.   Go out &amp; face it head on. If you lose you’ll learn &amp; if you win you’ll prove something to yourself.
@jamjones7 Ok Jumanji
@davehultin @FMRedHawks Thanks, man. Means a lot. See you at Newman!
3 things I wish I had learned earlier in baseball:  1) Coaches that were the hardest on me cared the most about me.  2) Look around &amp; recognize that you're doing what thousands wish they could do. Don't take a second for granted.  3) Have fun. It'll be over before you know it.
There is no greater destroyer of a season than a bunch of individuals playing for themselves. The essence of a team is that the individuals gel &amp; mold to become family and play as one unit.
I’m thankful for baseball. It’s taken me places I never knew existed, allowed me to meet people I never would’ve otherwise, &amp; gives me an ability to make memories with my family I’ll never forget. I’ll be writing about my experiences with @Sports_Spectrum: https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL https://t.co/2XoVXCY1KH
Too many leaders value peace over truth. There are things that must be said ... in love ... to members of your team that may upset them in the short term. As long as it's delivered with grace &amp; truth, it will benefit them in the long run. Don't let it go to avoid confrontation.
Practice &amp; earlywork is a time to get better. Too often we show up and go about our business halfheartedly.  If you won’t do it right in practice, don’t bother doing it.   When the time comes to execute in-game &amp; you make a mistake, it hurts worse when it’s from a lack of effort.
You can say whatever you want, but the lasting impact will be made based upon what you do. Your teammates &amp; coaches appreciate positive talk &amp; encouraging words but everything changes when you live it out.
You should respect yourself, the uniform, your team, and your coaches to run the ball out every single time ... even if you’re sure it’s an out.   It’s professional, it’s a reflection of who you are &amp; what you’ve been taught, and it puts pressure on the defense. You never know.
Want to impress your coach? It’s not the one time display of incredible talent. It’s the day to day dedication, perseverance, grit, heart, hustle, and determination necessary to compete at a high level. Coaches are impressed by those who buy in, sell out, &amp; chase their dreams.
Make the play, but SET YOUR FEET before you throw. It would be a shame to stop the ball like that yet throw it away in the end. Know the runner, know your arm, &amp; remember that you have more time than you think you do.   #STdrills https://t.co/39BEHs47oK
Coaches don't run you through team defense, base running, PFP, bullpens, batting practice, or bunt plays because you don't know how to do it ... they do it so that when the game is on the line you execute your job instinctually. We lock up and forget when we're unprepared.
I am writing a season-long journal on @Sports_Spectrum which chronicles the life of professional baseball from my perspective. I would love it if you’d follow along. My goal is to take you behind the scenes a bit &amp; share with you what it’s all about.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL
You want the results but you don’t want to put in the work? Not going to happen.   Results reflect reps.   Wherever you are &amp; whatever you do, remember there is someone working harder than you &amp; they want what you have. Be humble &amp; be content but never be satisfied. Let’s go.
Second after second, minute after minute, hour after hour, day after day, and step after step ... trust the process. You may not be where you want to be right now, but the key is to keep moving forward. Baby steps turn into giant leaps over time if you don't give up.
Not being able to self-evaluate hinders more people than a lack of talent does. If you’re never honest enough with yourself about the areas in which you need to grow, you’ll never grow. It’s not always easy, but it’s always necessary.
You only get one first impression &amp; often, only one opportunity to stand out. The truth is, however, that we don’t know when or how that chance will come. So, always be ready. Never take a second for granted. Often, chances come when we least expect it. Be prepared.
We are one bad moment away from losing everything we’ve worked our whole lives for. Remember, who you surround yourself with is important &amp; integral to who you’re becoming. Be smart, stay humble, &amp; give thanks every day for those who lift you up, keep you going, &amp; help you grow.
Failure. Nobody likes to talk about it but everyone needs to hear it. Nobody that has achieved excellence has done so without a setback, a failure, or a roadblock. It’s not about the failure, it’s about the response. Love this. Thanks @RaginCajunsBSB https://t.co/10WpBkzaxQ
I’m excited about having everyone follow me on a journey through a professional baseball season from a manager’s perspective. @Sports_Spectrum and I have partnered up in this endeavor &amp; I would be honored if you would join me.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL  @FMRedHawks
You may have lost, but that loss can quickly become a lesson with the right mindset. It’s okay to be upset. The problem arises when we let it define us. Get up and move on more wisely. It’s not that you’ll never make mistakes. It’s that you shouldn’t make the same mistake twice.
The latest issue of “The Good Life” magazine is out now. Someone thought it would be a good idea to put me on the cover &amp; do a feature, so here it is. Hope you enjoy!   @FMRedHawks    https://t.co/SRIwDYcVLN
I’m excited to partner with @Sports_Spectrum on a season-long “Diary of a Minor League Manager.” This will give you an inside look into what life is like in pro baseball at the minor league level from my perspective. Today, we released the intro post.   https://t.co/qF1zKGtlgL
When you throw a pitch you want &amp; it’s not called in your favor how do you react? The body language you present may play a factor in how an umpire calls the rest of the game. Besides that, poor body language let’s the opponent know they’ve got you &amp; affects the rest of your game.
You are where you are for a reason. Don’t dwell on your location, work hard to keep moving towards your goals &amp; dreams. Those who achieved greatness were content but never satisfied where they were. Stay hungry &amp; stay humble.
“How many pitches can I execute in my 110 pitch starts?” - @LGio27.  Making pitches is the name of the game, but don’t think of your outing any other way but pitch by pitch. Don’t think about winning the game. Think about winning each pitch.   #STdrills   https://t.co/p7oIVbdKOB
Welcome, March. A new month. A fresh start. A clean slate. Give thanks for the blessings and learn from the struggles. The best time to start is right now. Get up, go out, and make it happen.
@PitchingNinja Love it, @LMcCullers43. Goes against rhythm &amp; timing of 99% of our deliveries, which makes it tough to master. When done correctly, it exposes the inner "robot" in every hitter. They become accustomed to learning/training for certain cues that even a small pause works wonders.
@JDCmusic every day calls for a donut.
Errors are excusable, poor body language is not. Coaches don’t expect perfection, but they do expect professionalism &amp; maturity. If you want to get on the field &amp; stay on the field, then it’s time to show up, step up, and grow up.
The most important pitches you’ll make all game long come from the stretch with runners in scoring position. Why, then, do we only give the stretch a 5-7 pitch practice window in bullpens? We should throw 50%, if not 75% of our pen from the stretch. Success doesn’t just happen.
Interesting read from @based_ball about the decline of the wind up.   https://t.co/7TLBIuR78g
The best thing someone can do for a kid is make them stand up to their superiors &amp; speak up for themselves. If they aren’t happy, learn to confront it head on. The longer someone else does the dirty work for them, the longer they won’t know what being an adult is all about.
There are two ways to think:     -From a negative viewpoint, which increases PRESSURE.  or    -From a positive viewpoint, which increases CONFIDENCE.  The choice is yours.
Oh my Maddux. #STdrills @LMcCullers43 https://t.co/kGLRxCOEkC
Love this @BostonGlobe article about the @RedSox new offensive approach. Being more aggressive earlier in the count may pay big dividends. Read: https://t.co/r0dKDFkBiZ
Fair or not, the parent is a big factor in what coaches/evaluators/scouts think about an athlete. The helicopter/overbearing parent, the "my kid is a 1st rounder parent, or the "peering over the scout's shoulder to see notes" parent isn't good &amp; reflects negatively on your child.
Expect excellence. Eliminate excuses. Find a way.
We show up to the field every day and just act like it’s another ho-hum day. We complain, we go through the motions, then we go home. What we’ve forgotten is that any day could be our last &amp; thousands would trade places with us in an instant. It’s time to play with passion daily.
I love that he runs right out of the box. He doesn’t watch, he doesn’t bat flip, he doesn’t taunt, he just runs. Every single base matters every single game.  Those one run losses can quickly be turned around with this type of effort every time. #STdrills https://t.co/K4utDqLtv1
If your dream, vision, and goals all involve extraordinary things yet your work ethic is nothing but ordinary, what’s the point? Those who achieve greatness work harder than anyone else to reach it. Don’t regret a second of chasing a dream, work for it, don’t just wish for it.
“Why are they so hard on me” right now usually becomes “they really cared about me” later.
Make a way, not an excuse. The best teammates set a high standard from the other ones on the field. Don’t get defensive, get determined. Take criticism as a challenge &amp; a warning. A team always wants to improve &amp; give their best.
Yelling doesn’t accomplish anything unless your objective is to come across as a jerk. Be constructive in your criticism, clear in your communication, and confident enough to know when encouragement is needed instead of negativity.
When you cross those white lines, that switch should flip. I’m all for being friends with people on the other team, but when it’s game time, set those aside. It is possible to be friends with people but also be competitive &amp; give your best for your teammates.
Everyone is a good teammate when you’re winning. The true leaders &amp; the best teammates are revealed in tough times when your back is against the wall.   Character is revealed through adversity. Be the type of teammate who lifts up when it may be easier to put down.
Many times, those who are hardest on us care the most about us. Tough love &amp; constructive criticism are pivotal in growth. We all need people in our lives who can tell us where we need to improve, hold us accountable when things aren’t going well, &amp; be honest when others won’t.
Couldn’t be happier to have Matt on board as our GM. He’s incredibly smart &amp; I’m thankful to work alongside a guy who can blend baseball &amp; business so well. #FMRedHawks @FMRedHawks https://t.co/IpIl712zyZ
The best coaches you’ll ever have will demand the most from you, be the toughest on you, be truthful with you no matter what, &amp; constructively criticize you constantly. Those who care the most about you will expect the most of you.
Strike 1 is important, but I would argue that the 1-1 count pitch is the most important and most pivotal pitch in the entire at bat. The 1-2 vs 2-1 difference is astounding. Pitchers: when ahead in the count, go for the strikeout &amp; when behind in the count, go for the result.
“Overnight success” isn’t true. True success comes from a dream, a vision, a plan, adversity, setbacks, perseverance, grit, determination, &amp; faith. Success is often built upon YEARS, TEARS, &amp; FEARS. Years in the making, tears in the process, &amp; fears that are overcome.
@JonAcuff How do you market &amp; promote yourself without being a) annoying, b) overbearing, or c) too salesy?
There is a lot of truth to the statement that “you should only look down on someone when you’re helping them back up.” We should never be above anyone in terms of status, because the more influence we’re given the more we should serve others.
Thanks to @mikelinch for letting be a part of Lunch With A Leader today at @nsckennesaw. Thankful to share whenever I can &amp; thankful for the platform. Looking forward to the next one!
I am very excited to begin working with Matt as he takes on the role of our new GM. Our early conversations &amp; meetings have gone so well. He’s very talented, communicates well, and loves Fargo-Moorhead. Couldn’t be happier for him to come aboard! https://t.co/XzyuV1Zrab
. @Rangers fans: I highly recommend you check out the latest Linch With A Leader podcast with @mikelinch &amp; 3B coach Tony Beasley. Few are respected and loved like Tony. Hearing from him about overcoming cancer, leadership, etc. is a must! https://t.co/fpM7tRPHtb @Sullivan_Ranger
If you want to be successful when the lights are the brightest &amp; the game means the most, you’ve got to train hard when the lights are off &amp; no one is watching. Our character is built &amp; our skills are sharpened when we push ourselves day by day &amp; expect excellence continuously.
My life has now been changed forever. Thank you. https://t.co/y24Sj4FUsn
When it’s all said and done, who you were, how you impacted those around you, and how you treated others will matter more than any success or awards. Far too often we spend our whole lives chasing what we think matters &amp; we end up neglecting what truly matters.
A misconception is that you only have to be a good teammate when you’re at the field. The truth is, being a good teammate is even more important away from the field. To be your best ON the field, you must take care of yourself OFF the field. Nutrition, sleep, smart choices, etc.
•Show up early. If you're on time, you're probably late.   •Be a good teammate. Your team is your family during this season.   •Work hard.
Body language speaks louder than any words ever will. Scouts notice. Coaches notice. Teammates notice.
@MLB Sorry about that guys, I never learned how to drive a stick.
Pitchers-When a player on the field makes an error while you're on the mound, the worst thing you can do is show bad body language. It reflects poorly on you (mental makeup) but also shows your selfishness. Keep your composure, let your teammate know you have their back, &amp; pitch.
Statistically speaking, most players won't go pro in baseball. However, the game still teaches amazing life lessons. Either way it's a win.
Small things add up to win big games. @Andrelton with the deke cutoff play is one of the best “thinking on your toes” plays I’ve ever seen. https://t.co/zA4oGwjMQM
The pitch itself is nasty, yes. The key to this pitch, however, is the fastball arm speed. Deception fools the hitter, movement is icing on the cake. (GIF: @PitchingNinja) #STdrills https://t.co/LwuiPdEAMj
“You can’t have a devoted heart if you have a distracted heart.”  {@mikelinch}
@mlbbowman If you can't produce runs on certain days, save runs.
Want to know what a true team looks like? Grit &amp; fight til the last out, encouraging of teammates even when it’s not going well, everyone knowing &amp; embracing their roles regardless of the size, no pouting, no complaining, no whining, and every single day feels like family.
Part of being an effective leader is preaching accountability and excellence. Then, when those things are taken advantage of or not lived up to, acting on accountability. Setting the tone with discipline &amp; the bar high is pivotal to the success &amp; failure of the team as a whole.
Who you TRULY are is who you become when adversity strikes.
This is spring training. Games don’t count. Runs don’t matter. Stats aren’t important. However, when you take pride in what you do, this is the result. Play with passion &amp; purpose when it doesn’t matter so that you’re prepared for when it does. #STdrills https://t.co/wZXR72kXp6
Notice the take is just as aggressive as the swing. You should be fully committed to swinging &amp; then decide to take. Not the alternative. #STdrills https://t.co/HBwE947Y25
Good talent can get you through a lack of work ethic for a little while. But, good work ethic can get you through a lack of talent for a long time. Work. Hard. Every. Single. Day.
@kah1423 Nice win coach. Loved seeing the boys never get down &amp; show some grit til the end. Also, the starter gave up early runs but buckled down and kept you in the game. Did his job! That’s the making of a really good team right there.
@bottlerocket My favorite is every dad on the plane when it lands in Atlanta, who add to the flight attendant’s “welcome to Atlanta” with “where the players play” then laugh, tighten their crocs, and stand up way too early to clog the aisle.
If coaches would talk to their players more about their setbacks, failures, and shortcomings ... the fear of failure would diminish greatly. If you want to meet someone where they are, start with failures, because nobody is perfect. The best examples are those who OVERCAME.
Baseball is not a game for the lazy. With so many physical &amp; mental components, it's imperative to continue working hard to achieve success. There are no days off.
Championship teams:  -Pick each other up.  -Embrace adversity.  -Find the lesson in losses. -Never get complacent. -Expect excellence. -Believe in each other.  -Have a vision.  -Set goals. -Don’t fear failure.  -Set the bar high.  -Are selfless. -Play hard until the very end.
Many of the errors that occur in baseball aren't a result of the initial bobble. They come from the resulting panic &amp; rushing. Breathe.
@JonGordon11 Often, those are the best ones. Real, unrehearsed, straight from the heart. Love it.
Leaders aren't always vocal. A leader can lead by example as well. Strive to lead by showing others how it should be done every single time.
Why would you give anything less than your best every single day? A lot of people invest a lot of time, energy, and money into this for YOU.
It's not that you'll never give up runs. It's that you must learn to limit the damage and prevent the big innings. Make pitches.
A good teammate is encouraging, selfless, &amp; positive. A bad teammate hinders, is selfish, &amp; negative.
What you do is what you do. Who you are is your identity. Sports may be what you do, but it’s not who you are. Coaches and scouts at the next level look at both who you are and what you do when making a decision about you. Make sure who you are lines up with what you want to do.
Do as the game dictates. Use all fields. At times, you have to throw your stats out of the window for the sake of the team. That’s what a good teammate is all about. You can’t just expect to do it though. Be intentional in the cage.   We &gt; Me.   #STdrills  https://t.co/0Ca2KwxX4v
Joey Votto said, "Let the ball be your feedback." We work so much on technical and mechanical issues with a swing that we forget the best teacher can be what the result is. Focus on and learn from the trajectory, spin, and actions of the baseball after you make contact. #STdrills
The odds aren't in your favor to play at the next level. Embrace it. Use it as fuel to motivate you every single day. Why not you?
Developing a championship culture gives players and staff short term goals, long term aspirations, &amp; huge dreams. It allows them to take risks knowing that you’ll be there to catch them if they fall, &amp; it develops serious perseverance.
You can’t expect to do something a few times &amp; master it. Becoming great &amp; expecting excellence takes dedication, perseverance, &amp; lots of work. There’s always somebody out there working harder than you who wants what you want. Don’t wait for it to happen-make it happen. #STdrills https://t.co/LI8Kswdr9o
Learn to read the ball off the bat. There is a time to wait back &amp; read a hop, but if you see that ball on the ground ... go get it. Get the ball, don’t let it get you. #STdrills https://t.co/26gtahbyKw
You win as a team and you lose as a team. Too many individuals can infect any momentum a team has or they can expedite any losing streak. The 0-4 pouting when the team wins &amp; the 3-4 celebrating when the team loses must stop. Your teammates deserve better than that.
Catch the ball first, find the bag next. Hit the “fair” or inside part of the bag, then stay in fair territory to avoid a collision with the runner. When you’ve made the out, pivot and check to make sure no other runners (if any) are advancing. #STdrills https://t.co/VnYbaCc2Ah
Ok, I’ll try. https://t.co/R4jP2UPFS4
Win as a team ... with class.  Lose as a team ... with class.  Wear the uniform ... with class. Represent yourself ... with class. Treat coaches ... with class. Treat success ... with class. Treat failure ... with class. Play the game ... with class.
Notice that he doesn’t drift to the baseball. He runs hard to the spot, using his hand as a guide since he was close to the wall, &amp; then got under it before timing the jump. Even if you’re not at the wall, don’t drift to the spot, get to it. #STdrills https://t.co/Z2CuKiRZs6
Hustle ON &amp; hustle OFF the field. Respect the game &amp; respect your coaches. It’s professionalism at its best. There should never be a time where you feel it’s necessary to walk. Show some heart &amp; show some hustle every time you cross those lines. #STdrills https://t.co/xB4Wi72qLf
“Why would we waste our time learning how to slide, coach? If I’m going to play pro ball, I’ll never do this. Can’t we just hit or something?” #STdrills https://t.co/1pp1K69e7R
If you want to separate yourself from the rest in the outfield, you must work on reading the ball, footwork, and changing directions. A good outfielder knows this and a great outfielder does this. #STdrills https://t.co/X6UcyKClJ0
@EddieTaubensee It’s a fungo. Everyone is safe.
There are no wasted movements in the cage. Notice the thought &amp; intent that goes into every swing AND every take. There is no sense of urgency. Knowing your swing &amp; movements in the cage are essential to in-game success. Make it a habit. #STdrills https://t.co/Y6WwSCJHuw
@PitchingNinja @DrivelineBB His stuff is plus. We’re excited to have him in a @FMRedHawks uni.
Progress happens away from the bright lights &amp; cheering crowd. This is where the foundation is laid. The hardest thing to do is work hard when no one watches. The easiest thing to do is say, “I’ll get to that later.” Don’t miss an opportunity because you’re unprepared. #STdrills https://t.co/z3oTikL34C
As a catcher, the target you give is crucial. Give it early &amp; present it with the understanding that, visually, it’s a pitcher’s lifeline. Also, how you receive &amp; present the throw are critical to an umpire’s call. Often this can be the difference between a ball/strike. #STdrills https://t.co/VUD3Y54J3Z
I would be honored if you would listen to this podcast I did with @MinorLgeReport. We talk about the @FMRedHawks, baseball in general, &amp; more. It will be a weekly podcast during the season where you'll actually be able to send in questions for me!  https://t.co/rbA61v7c6U

If you step onto the field without a plan, you will waste time, energy, and effort. It starts with a dream, continues with a vision, and is realized with a plan &amp; purpose.
When it comes to an approach on offense, a key phrase should be, “find a way.” This isn't a haphazard walk to the box with a "hope I can" mentality. We must KNOW the pitcher, UNDERSTAND their thought process, &amp; ADJUST to their game plan. Not all outs are bad by the way. #STdrills

Fielding the ball is only the beginning at 1B. When the pitcher is coming to cover, a good feed (leading him toward the bag) and a catchable feed (hit him in the chest) are of utmost importance. This should be worked on &amp; mastered to play a solid 1B. #STdrills https://t.co/uVTJwafAHk
. @FMRedHawks https://t.co/3ETgkWHRlo
Volume up &amp; listen. The catcher is the shot caller on the infield and needs to be heard. Even the play that everyone knows where the ball is going, you can hear Russell Martin calling “one one one.” Communication on the field is essential. #STdrills https://t.co/Zo7oYbg4D9
Simple drills &amp; not a lot of materials can transform your practice. Bunting properly &amp; to the right locations is often the difference between winning &amp; losing those close games. Don’t wait for runs, produce them. Productive outs are key. #STdrills https://t.co/gAvZTMsYBZ

Each time you put on that uniform you are:  -Representing your team. -Representing your family. -Representing yourself. -Representing your community. -Representing your coaches. -Representing the game.  Take it seriously and give thanks. THOUSANDS would gladly trade with you.
Every movement you make on the field should have a purpose. There is a big difference between motion and progress.
The most important things a pitcher can do when fielding a bunt &amp; pivoting to throw is STAY LOW, STAY FOCUSED, &amp; STAY CALM. Errors are caused by rushing the body &amp; trying to rush the throw combined with aiming the throw. Trust your abilities &amp; take your PFPs seriously. #STdrills https://t.co/Q8L8eYuLvw
When you find your WHY you will find your WAY.
We strive to make the name on the back of our jersey known, and we neglect the name on the front of it. The interesting thing is what happens when you care more about the name on the front of the jersey than the back. Not only does your play improve, but so does your reputation.
Baserunning &amp; the footwork involved are critical. That’s why, from T-Ball to the big leagues, it’s worked on. It shouldn’t be boring if it’s a part of something you love. (Hit the inside part of the bag with your right foot). #STdrills https://t.co/oTkZzWZCpr
Scouts &amp; recruiters are interested in your talents as a ballplayer ... but a lot of the final decision rests on you me character as a person. Clean it up &amp; remember ... if you want to be a pro, act like one.
Good, clean transfer, nice powerful position to throw, &amp; gaining ground with feet as it all happens. Details are key &amp; often the difference in throwing runners out or not. The pitcher should keep them off base, but the catcher should hold them. #STdrills https://t.co/O3tvW0375t

@KDB_MLB I’m still at the wake up part.
Anyone can be positive &amp; work hard when things are going well. The true character of an individual is revealed when things aren’t going their way &amp; times get tough. You’ll learn a lot through adversity but you’ll also teach others a lot through adversity too.
“The worst part of my day is agilities and warmups. I can’t believe we waste our time doing this. I want to get to pro ball, then I can do whatever I want. I can just show up and play.” #STdrills https://t.co/KS0205GwwG
Winners aren’t people that never lose. Winners are people that learn from losing better than other people.
Anyone can coach. Few can lead. One is a title given to almost anyone in  an authority position athletically. The other is a description that is  earned from walking in when everyone else is walking out. Coaches tell  you how to get through it, leaders go through it with you.
If your mindset is "I hope I can" rather than "I know I can" you're doing yourself a disservice. Show up daily believing in yourself, your abilities, &amp; the work you put in to be successful.
Telling your athletes stories of when you fell short or failed isn’t a sign of weakness. Actually, it helps reduce anxiety &amp; a fear of failure in them. If their coach isn’t perfect, it allows them room to take risks too. True strength is found in those who failed &amp; got back up.
@robgreene @Fergie Rob. Listen again. Just .... listen. 😂
A championship team will never defer blame, make excuses, or give up. A championship team adopts each other as family, plays like there’s no tomorrow, &amp; out-works anyone &amp; everyone. Want to be a championship team? Beginning right now expect nothing but excellence every day.
Check out where his feet are at the moment he catches the ball. He’s in prime position to transfer &amp; throw (fielding the ball off his back leg). Footwork as an infielder is so important. Every extra second counts when it comes to getting outs. #STdrills https://t.co/netI4kbGwY

It’s not home run derby. It’s not a time to mess around. In the cage, take each swing &amp; every movement seriously. You can’t expect to execute when it counts if you mess around when it doesn’t. #STdrills https://t.co/0vFie9a635
Footwork is a much overlooked yet very important aspect that everyone on the field needs to improve upon. Make it a priority to move better so that you can play better. Sometimes you can improve in small ways that will pay huge dividends. #STdrills https://t.co/3FnwJhgKYS
A big misconception in life is that people who are successful have never failed. I say that’s false. I would venture to guess that most people who are successful reached that point by walking into, enduring, &amp; walking out of adversity. The strength we need is born in tough times.
Anyone can learn what it takes to be a true team player. The “intangibles” that coaches talk about can be taught and learned. Wake up every day expecting excellence, put the right people around you, and strive to be your best every single moment.
As long as you have that last out, you have a chance. Don't give in and don't give up.
Just because someone is physically strong doesn't make them tough. It's entirely possible to be physically strong and mentally weak. True toughness comes from the grit, heart, and perseverance to face adversity head on, walk through it, &amp; emerge on the other side wiser than ever.
The higher up we get in sports the more complicated we make it. However, every single time, the best ones go back to the basics to be successful. Never lose sight of what got you there.
As a coach, I love teaching the game. However, one of the most rewarding aspects of it all is when a player coaches themselves on the field. It shows they listen, apply, and most of all ... care.
The foundation of success is character, hard work, &amp; determination. Once those are in place, continue honing your skill set &amp; continue learning every single day. A firm foundation, along with training &amp;  an eagerness to learn, is a recipe for success.
Amazing things happen when you stop thinking about yourself and start  thinking about your teammates. Selfless players are the best players.     WE &gt; ME

If you want to leave a legacy where you are, roll up your sleeves and get to work. No one is above anyone else. In fact, the best leaders humble themselves and serve those they lead. That, by the way, is the manager of the #Mets. #STdrills https://t.co/YrMytnk4HQ
Leaders:  ☑️ Expect excellence  ☑️ Love before they lead  ☑️ Endlessly encourage  ☑️ Serve selflessly  ☑️ Push positivity  ☑️ Leave a legacy
The teams who are slowed by speed bumps and stopped by obstacles are the same teams who don’t have their vision in place &amp; goals prioritized. Set the bar high, but set attainable benchmarks along the way. Doing the little things wins big games.
The difference between a good outfielder and a great outfielder is getting a good jump on the baseball. The initial step is pivotal. Some of it is instinctual, but most of it is learned and taught. Pros work on it every day, you can too. #STdrills https://t.co/26kUsJ3ftz

If you’re building your team/organization only around the type of performer they are &amp; take no consideration into the type of person they are, it may work out in the short term. However, over time, great people with some talent always prevail over bad people with lots of talent.
The most important relationship on the field is the pitcher/catcher. A pitcher must feel comfortable with the catcher to trust them, and the catcher must know the pitcher to make the right call. Above that, they must both feel comfortable with each other to be in sync. #STdrills https://t.co/xFedvQv3ZT
Players show up every day focused on themselves, yet they want the team to win. If a team is full of individuals, it will never truly be a team. Want to win? Show up, think of others, and do what you need to do to help. TEAM means family, togetherness, and selflessness.
Coaches use fear tactics to try and motivate players, then wonder why said players won’t dive, take an extra base, or risk anything beyond the sure thing.   Fear causes timidity. Timidity makes taking risks nearly impossible due to fearing failure.  Encourage. Push. Motivate.
@FMRedHawks Wonder whose tickets those are? 👀
A coach looks at talent. But, a coach also looks at how you interact with others, what type of teammate you are, how you represent yourself in the community, what type of grades you make, how you treat your family, and many other things. Don’t fool yourself. Character matters.
@RonPopeMusic Your number is on speed dial.
@RonPopeMusic We were grinding it out. Wanted to make it big hitting tanks. Instead, you play music and I coach. We tried.
@EddieTaubensee Because you like someone I like. That makes me smile.
A true “banana route” to first takes too long &amp; makes it easier to beat the pitcher. The shortest distance from A to B is a straight line. Just make sure you hit the inside part of the bag &amp; stay in fair territory to avoid a collision. #STdrills https://t.co/VOOvlBoR8E
Games are decided by 1 run all the time. This can make or break an entire season. Many times, that run difference comes from a pitcher either making or missing a play. Take this part of your game seriously. #STdrills  https://t.co/Czia5u6jxM
@TheRealSalami The baseball isn’t altered at all if it hits one. Catchers aren’t affected by it one bit.
Receiving well is so important. Besides being a great target for the pitcher, a solid receiver also “presents” the pitches to the umpire for optimal views. A great receiver can make balls seem like strikes more than you’d think. #STdrills https://t.co/gmqKEd170c
Sometimes, it’s mechanics. Other times, it’s focus. Too many young pitchers focus on the “house” when they should really be focusing on the “doorknob.” Don’t lose sight of the importance of visualization, focal points, and intent.
@Saw_Ville35 @theaceofspaeder It helps because it’s all about a focal point. If you don’t have strings you can try getting your son to choose a target &amp; focal point that’s lower than what he normally would do. Too often kids focus on the “house” when they need to be focusing on the “doorknob”
@Saw_Ville35 @theaceofspaeder That’s right. Condition yourself to throw the ball down. Visualize it. Great tool. Really works.
A team isn’t a team with even a single selfish player. A team becomes a team when everyone thinks of others before themselves.
@LucasBiespiel @theaceofspaeder There’s enough weight and velo of baseball to do nothing more than strum them like a guitar string. Doesn’t affect flight of ball at all.
@NatsuDeez @drivelinebases Nothing is wrong with technology but many don’t have access to it. Why tag Kyle? He knows me and where I stand. Love that guy. Amazed by what he’s done &amp; thankful for his MANY contributions to this game.
Strings. A simple tool to promote a simple idea. Throw the ball down in the zone over and over and over. You don’t need fancy computers, elaborate materials, or anything else. If you want to improve, sometimes all you need are a few household materials. #STdrills https://t.co/W1lKPCau7d
“Hitting off a tee is for little kids. Pros don’t do that. I can’t believe my coach is making me do this boring stuff. I just want to hit homers!” #STdrills https://t.co/3TTRru1CP9
Read this. Then, read it again. The value of first pitch strikes cannot be overstated. The percentages are there. This is not something your coach just says to sound smart. If we can focus on this &amp; take it to heart BIG things will happen.   https://t.co/dTLUOUqYf6  @JWonCATCHING
Timing is everything in this game. It revolves around your body &amp; the pitcher’s delivery. Just as pitchers have a balance point to reach, hitters have a load. Pros are focusing on the same thing you are. Work on it. #STdrills https://t.co/gsNSesToIg
Just putting on the gear and squatting down behind the plate doesn’t make you a catcher. The pitcher plays an important role in keeping guys off bases, but the catcher plays an important role in not letting them advance. The battery can win games. Master your craft. #STdrills https://t.co/1oJNLfqkLb
Truly heartbreaking news out of Florida today. Thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by this tragedy. Hug your loved ones a little tighter &amp; make sure you let them know how much they mean to you.
There are winning players and losing players on each team. The interesting part is that there are winning players that are less talented &amp; losing players that are more talented. Talent matters to a point, but character, determination, &amp; grit are a recipe for longevity.

Tomorrow morning, our new @nsckennesaw devotional called “Over The Hump” will make its way to people’s inboxes. Be one of them. If you’re a coach, player, or sports fan, this is for you. Hope you’ll spread the word &amp; share the news.   https://t.co/r6UlQMFLIZ https://t.co/hUVL873uuz
A bullpen isn’t something that should be rushed through. The best pitchers take time between each pitch to reflect &amp; focus on what needs to be worked on. Be intentional with every single motion. #STdrills  https://t.co/dqSGNt3NZF
Take what you like from those you admire. Learn from those you respect.  Emulate those who are successful. But, never forget who you are.

I’ve found that the most under appreciated time in baseball is playing catch. This is a great time to focus on mechanics, arm path, work your pitches, &amp; commit to commanding the baseball. Don’t neglect this area or take it lightly. #STdrills  https://t.co/RmsLUGpDqU
@MLBNetwork Maury Wills is an amazing man. He's involved with our @FMRedHawks organization and loves talking baseball and sharing knowledge whenever he can. There are few with a heart like his for both people and baseball. We're very blessed. Thanks for talking about him!

Truly chasing a dream means going against the current. It means sacrifice. It means ridicule. It means people won't understand. It means sleepless nights, anxious thoughts, &amp; stressed moments. It also means purpose. It means perseverance. Determination. Go for it. It's worth it.

Simply put: to be successful, everyone on your team must have the same vision &amp; be moving in the same direction. People on your team may be giving the advantage to the opponent simply by their actions, their negativity, and their inability to buy in.
A building is measured by its height, but without the foundation, nothing else would be able to stand. We often forget that building a foundation first is necessary for solid growth. Trust the process, take your time, &amp; remember that slow &amp; steady wins over fast &amp; reckless.
Your words may say one thing, but your actions may say something else altogether. Strive to make them the same. When you do, you’ll flourish. #integrity
Somehow I don’t think @DaveRamsey agrees with their choice here.   https://t.co/mUzjqk9uJZ
If you want to improve, you’ve got to face adversity head on. Running from it, hiding from it, &amp; being protected from it do not help. No one wishes it on anyone, it’s not fun, &amp; it’s rarely expected. However, when it comes, take each moment as a lesson.
Far too often, athletes become quickly discouraged that they “don’t have the same skillset as that person” or they “will never be able to do what they did.” The truth of the matter is that whether we’re a starter or the last one on the bench, we’ve made the team for a reason.
@simoncholland Probably not where you expected that thread to go...
@simoncholland Or he was teaching his parents patience.
@simoncholland In his defense, maybe never. He can do all things.
Take pride in whatever it is that you do. From the smallest detail to the largest project, all things should be done with pride &amp; to the best of your abilities. Who you are is determined in part by how you are when no one is looking. Excellence is built from daily determination.
If you want to change the culture of your organization, start with one person. That changed person will change someone, and that changed person will change someone. Before you realize it, an entire group is changed because you invested in one.

@drewsaylor19 Wow. So good. Thanks for sharing that.
Never lose sight of the fact that the words you say will be a main factor in how you’re remembered. We have the opportunity to change lives every day with positivity, faith, and hope ... yet all we can muster are petty complaints &amp; negativity about every situation. Let’s improve.
@ZGrimmig15 Thanks dude. Appreciate that.
@ZGrimmig15 I know how many followers I have, but none of the other stuff. The struggle for me isn’t striving for a number (though it used to be) — my struggle is remembering that it’s not the size of your platform that determines how influential you are. So I try not to focus on it.
We’ve all hopped on social media solely focused on the number of followers. Rather than worrying about how many follow us, let’s worry about making sure the content we share with even just one has the ability to transform &amp; impact lives.
If it ever becomes a grind, it’s time to find something else to do.
A team is only as good as the weakest link. A lot of times, the weakest link is a term given to an athlete for how they are as a teammate &amp; has very little to do with on field play. A team can overcome physical mistakes easier than having bad teammates around them daily.
A good coach is there to remind us of our purpose, help us recall information, &amp; to realign us when things go wrong. Whether a starter or the last one off the bench, each athlete brings something to the team. Replenish them rather than ripping them apart.
The best coaches dig deep within themselves &amp; share their hardest experiences in life. Leaders know that the struggles they walked through &amp; overcame in the past can help those struggling right now.
Baseball and summertime. Not even close. https://t.co/MeQGwIsnbw
We over me.  Find a way.  Believe and achieve. Expect excellence. Together we can.
5 Steps to becoming a better on-field leader:  1) never forget how hard it was to play the game.   2) remember that each athlete is an individual.   3) coach from your experience with failure, not just success.   4) love before you lead.   5) coaching is a platform, not a stage.
@TheTopLife Yes! Thanks!

Show up everyday with a mission to make everyone around you better &amp; you will never go wrong a day in your life.
A coach’s primary job is to lead those under their care with integrity &amp; empathy. Athletes want your direction and correction in love, never forgetting how hard the game was to play.

When you have a leader that is like this, you can do that. “This” is @NFoles_9 &amp; “that” is a super bowl championship team. https://t.co/ZTGmsjU5Rw
Your coach sets the bar high with conditioning tests &amp; other benchmarks not because it’s always necessary for success, but because it tests your commitment to the coach, the team, &amp; yourself. Take it seriously &amp; prove yourself.
Whether you like football or not, you should watch this. EVERYONE has something to learn from this. https://t.co/BGW9fcKo9S
If you don't exactly know where you're going &amp; you don't have clear vision &amp; a GPS, there's a good chance you won't make it there. The same goes for our dreams &amp; goals. A clear vision is essential and a road map (discipline, a plan, work ethic) is necessary.
@JonAcuff not your finest wine, Jon.
In a time where everyone wants instant results, we have to remind ourselves that greatness is produced over time. Success is built upon a day by day process of discipline and hard work. People may not understand. You may stand out. However, it works and it'll be worth it.
It’s important to remember that where you fit on a team has some to do with what you do on the field, but a lot to do with how you are off it. Be a good teammate, contribute to the team, &amp; strive to make those around you better because you’re there.

@rylandgoede10 Yessir! Love it.
Knowing your role is critical to a team’s success. The thing about a TEAM is that everyone’s role ... no matter how big or how small ... is important. Embracing it does not mean you’re not hungry for a bigger role. Your role will get bigger when the coach trusts you with less.
@PlayersTribune @PatrikLaine29 So is poutine
The best way to show your coach you care is by showing up every day &amp; striving to be the best you can be while always working to  improve. Anyone can show up &amp; go through the motions. It’s those who actually decide to self-evaluate &amp; constructively criticize that will see change.
@Decker6 What part of Atlanta will you be in?
A fast track to failure is thinking you've "made it." We can always learn, always grow, always mature, always improve. When you stay put and say "I've made it" someone else is getting up and saying "I want it." Don't get passed by because of pride. Humble yourself &amp; keep working.
It’s not always WHAT you say, but HOW you say it. As leaders, we can deliver the right words in the wrong tone or context &amp; they carry zero weight. Awareness &amp; feel are huge.
The @Eagles head coach was a high school football coach 10 years ago. If you have a passion &amp; a dream, keep on going. It doesn’t matter where you are right now. If you’re good at it, keep improving, and love what you do — that’ll shine through. Never say never. #FlyEaglesFly

We make progress every day when we keep learning. Those who stop making progress or become stuck are those who refuse to learn or think they know it all. The best in the game learn until they retire. If you call it a passion &amp; calling, you should strongly desire to learn daily.

I receive emails every single day from athletes wanting a job in professional baseball. One way that you can make yourself stand out before I even see your resume or statistics is to use correct grammar, spelling, etc. If you want to be a professional, take pride in everything.

Good culture is built from the ground. It’s a grassroots effort that starts with the coach, spreads from those who have been influenced, &amp; continues as people realize that our true motivation is to help others. If you want to change the culture of a group, start with one person.
When things don’t go your way, the best thing you can exhibit is accountability. Don’t make excuses, make a plan. Figure out what went wrong, what you can improve on, &amp; how to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Coaches don’t expect perfection but they don’t expect excuses either.
So, what do you do as a coach?  https://t.co/C2jT24jK9a
The majority of athletes say they want to get better, say they want to improve, &amp; talk all about their future &amp; dreams. However, when the time comes, they don’t want to actually work for it. Dreams without work rarely become a reality.
The best part about February is that baseball is played this month. We won't have another month without baseball until November!
I know @MAppel26 personally, and I’m serious when I tell you that he’s one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. Proud of you, Mark. Whatever is next is exciting &amp; full of opportunity. https://t.co/xbBohtpyd8
It’s a new month, which means a clean slate. Move into this month having learned from ... not dwelling on ... whatever happened in the past. Fresh starts are the best way to reset, restart, and refresh your thinking &amp; move ahead more wisely.
Coaches &amp; recruiters at the next level look at what type of player AND what type of person you are. Think before you send on social media.
Reflecting back to my evening with @fargo_post2 baseball. I was honored and humbled to be a part of the evening as keynote speaker. The people of Fargo-Moorhead are among the greatest I’ve met in my life. Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts with you. https://t.co/3bpkqJsTlO
Excellence is born through daily drive &amp; determination. Never think that you can’t or won’t simply because of where you’ve been, what you did, or who you are. Those who achieve greatness started somewhere.
Achievements are good. Winning is nice. Championships are great. But, what matters most isn’t how much you acquired, how many times you won, or the number of championships you earned. What matters most is whether or not you positively impacted those in your sphere of influence.
Each of us have a platform. Every day that we wake up &amp; walk out of our door, we have the ability to influence someone. You don’t need a stage, a mic, thousands of followers, etc. Those who influence many began by influencing one. Never lose sight of that.
Karl is the best. So happy he’s a part of the @FMRedHawks family. Getting to work with people like him makes me really proud to be a part of this team &amp; organization. https://t.co/6RJvLcrI2m
@distemic @urbantoadmedia @FMRedHawks Hahaha truth
There is no room for excuses and excellence to exist in the same space. Coaches can't expect perfection, but they can expect excellence. Realizing what you need to work on, figuring out how to overcome it, and sticking with it until it's fixed is the quickest way to excellence.

What you dream of, what you aspire to, what you wish for, will never ever be simply handed to you. Those who achieve greatness get up, get moving, &amp; get after it. Change your mindset from “I’ll let it happen” to a “I’ll make it happen.”

If you truly want to achieve something great, you can’t just show up &amp; wait for it to fall into your lap. Excellence is born through daily drive &amp; determination. I've learned there truly are no overnight success stories. Everyone who achieved something great started somewhere.

Attitude is contagious. A good one can lift others up, carry others on, and help others through. A bad one can really damage progress &amp; productivity. For the sake of your team, lose the bad attitude. Lose the negativity. Choose to find the silver lining &amp; work to help others.
As base runners, pay attention. Keep your eyes up. Watch the tendencies of the catcher. Stay alert. One extra base can be the difference in an entire season!  https://t.co/NvwUOuZBxH
Young athletes live in a culture that says, "fit in, be perfect, get famous, look at me," &amp; thousands of other pressure filled things. The last thing they need is to show up to our game or practice &amp; have that amplified on them by us. Coaches should show them what truly matters.
As a coach, you may only have an athlete for a short time, but your impact can be generational. These athletes are going to become parents, workers, &amp; members of society. They’ll leave a legacy that’s often rooted in the way you treated them.

One of the biggest mistakes we can make is thinking we’ve learned it all or that someone can’t teach us anything. We can learn from anyone - because everyone has a story.

The success you experience under the bright lights is a direct reflection of the work you put in away from them. The true measure of character isn't how you work when everyone is watching. Your character is determined, measured, &amp; gauged off the work you do when NOBODY is around.
The best way to light a fire under your team/organization is to have a group of people all pulling on the same side of the rope. The same vision, goals, &amp; direction are pivotal for success. Recognize where this is lacking in your group &amp; work to rectify it as quickly as possible.

Want to be the best teammate you can be? Think of them before you think of yourself.
We show up every day and work on the physical components of the game, forgetting that so much of the edge we can gain comes from the mental side. Just like we go to the gym to strengthen our bodies we must begin to train &amp; work our minds to be ready for the long season ahead.
I’ve personally seen careers end over things that didn’t even happen on the field. Take care of your business on the field &amp; take care of yourself off it. Don’t allow one bad choice to ruin what you’ve been working towards your entire life.

Our heroes, the ones we admire, the ones who have reached the top, have done so from daily discipline and hard work. Becoming great is a process that takes time. That's why so few reach greatness. Start now, develop a plan, create clarity, set goals, &amp; trust the process.
It’s ok, folks. @FMRedHawks baseball is coming. Hold. On. Just. A. Bit. Longer. #skol
Day after day, we set big goals &amp; dream big dreams. Everything seems attainable when the road is flat &amp; smooth. However, at the first sign of a curve, a bump, or a roadblock, we begin to lose heart &amp; consider turning around. Don't. Tough times are strengthening you. Keep going.
I've watched people with great talent rise to the top solely based on their talent. However, their stay at the top was short. I've watched people with average talent rise to the top &amp; stay there based on their work ethic. There is lots of talent in the world but few hard workers.
Anything worthwhile will have speed bumps &amp; setbacks. The pivotal moment &amp; turning point of our life is how we react to those moments. There will be people with you who are critical &amp; there will be those who are encouraging. Choose wisely who gets to walk with you on the journey.
When the shouts of critical voices drown out the whispers of truth, remind yourself of your strengths, your blessings, and your abilities. The best way to silence the shouts of critics is to do that which they said you could never do.
@TraeMcGill @lokationnation @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics It’s like learning to drive &amp; see the road ahead before flooring it. Navigate &amp; learn to maneuver before driving at full speed (or faster)
@xanbarksdale Look good play good stops in high school. Those who decide if you play at the next level or not could care less how good you look. Doesn’t matter how good you look or how many accessories you have if you make errors.
@JLBish17 Learn what’s working for you that day &amp; to not panic. In game adjustments separates the average from the great. That quality alone can get you to the next level above someone else.
@KeithMadison32 Criticizing a coach in the presence of a child is bad on many levels. The one that stands out to me is that parents are teaching the child to disrespect authority. Bad life skill right there.
@CoachPerk @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @lokationnation @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics @jimlawler1 Mechanics are not universal. There are tendencies that have to be present in order for the body to do what it needs to do, but developing efficient, repeatable, “good for you/your body” movements should be what we strive for. Let’s eliminate these “cookie cutter” coaches/pitchers
@KeithMadison32 Belief comes from consistently seeing that hard work produces results. “If I do this, the result is that” snowballs over time into confidence each day.
@lokationnation @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics If a coach says “my way will prevent overuse” or “my plan prevents fatigue” then their ego is way too big. Fatigue can be from many factors and overuse can be from many years. Often we can only monitor and react ... not prevent.
@bomar19 @Bazbol @Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @lokationnation @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics We must look at how they’re performing in game. Know your pitcher &amp; watch for signs of fatigue. Overuse may look like a drop in velo or it may look like a lack of command. Could be immediately or after a certain number of pitches. Overuse may be from years prior too.
@Corey21Thompson @J_Wholestaff @lokationnation @CoachSheets3 @PitchMechanics The simplest reason is that our pitchers need some sort of recovery for the long haul of the season. However, it must be case by case. I have pitchers that lose feel if they don’t touch a ball (or a mound) every day. This includes off days. Not everyone is this way though.
Coaches instill fear in players &amp; make them afraid to take risks. They show up daily trying to be safe &amp; avoid your melt down. Then, when the time comes, you wonder why they won't play hard, maximize potential, &amp; give you full respect. That is earned over time by leading in love.
If you're not taking every rep seriously, you're not dedicated enough to play at the next level. Every rep..every play..every day..counts.
Pudge talking about his catching mechanics is a must listen if you want to improve. The pitcher has to do their part, but a mechanically sound catcher can be the difference in that one run game win/loss.  https://t.co/JgptVOhyhv

Something I’ve learned about myself in 2018: I can do some serious damage at pizza buffets.
When your life is over, the stats, the fame, the money, the stuff … none of it will matter and that’s not how you’ll be remembered. Your legacy lies in who you are as a person, how you impacted those who came after you, and the mark you left on the world.
We want to have purpose, make a difference, &amp; change lives. To find purpose, to make an impact, &amp; to help others means we must first walk into ... come through ... and learn from adversity. Experience is the best teacher. Embrace it &amp; keep your focus on the right things.
Congratulations to @FMRedHawksGM on being named the new @AA_Baseball Executive Director. 22 years working for the @FMRedHawks is truly amazing in today’s baseball world. Thanks, Josh. Appreciate all you’ve done! Best of luck!  https://t.co/hcPoba662n

Hey @FMRedHawks fans, make sure to get out to Sanctuary Events Center tonight to see my buddy @aaron_watson play! You won’t regret it one bit! https://t.co/4fy9lPIJGR
@aaron_watson Stop by the @FMRedHawks office today &amp; we’ll get you a hat to wear on stage tonight!! Fargo folks love their #fmredhawks! Hope you’re well man!
Body language speaks louder than any of your words ever will. Your body language tells the opponent, your teammates, and your coaches exactly how you're feeling. Playing at the next level means being a well rounded athlete. This includes ability AND attitude on the field.
When it comes down to game time, the coach will rely on who they believe will give them the best chance to be successful. It doesn’t matter how big you are, what you did in the past, or what others say about you. If you get it done you get in the game.
You may know a lot, but if you can’t communicate to those you’re leading it’s not worth anything. Communication is an essential part of leadership because it allows the message to be delivered in such a way, when done right, that informs, motivates, &amp; unites. Words are powerful.

You won’t win unless you work. The result is reaped during the summer but the foundation is laid during the winter. You can say all you want, but what you do (or don’t do) will speak the loudest.
Nothing that stands the test of time &amp; endures the test of adversity is created overnight. Strength is born from resistance &amp; endurance is born from overcoming adversity &amp; pushing past that which is difficult. Start today &amp; begin the process.
@penprase33 I get these ideas for the general topic of the tweet from things I’ve seen, or while I’m coaching here in the off season. Stories I’ve heard, experiences, etc. Then I just write it down. I guess that’s how my brain works, don’t know. Hope you’re well man. Enjoying your content!
@SealBeachEd I do. @FMRedHawks. Thanks very much! Means a lot.
Most of the world goes through life doing nothing more than status quo every single day. Doing even a little bit more than is required of you will cause you to stand out big time, regardless of what you do.

What you believe is what you become.
Be kind, humble, and respectful to all people you meet along the way. You never know when one of them will be pivotal to your next step. People often remember &amp; seldom forget how you treated them.
Going through the motions does no one any good. If you're going to show up, give your best. Otherwise you're only hurting yourself &amp; the team.
Fear and faith cannot exist in the same space. In all that you do, believe. Trust your abilities. Trust your hard work. Trust the process.
It might be early. It might be cold. It might be a sacrifice. It takes going the extra mile to be a champion. Work hard now, &amp; win later.
Lace up those cleats, put on that uniform, and run on to that field with the passion, heart, grit, determination, and love of someone who doesn't know what tomorrow brings. There will be a day that it's the last day you ever get to wear that uniform. Don't take it for granted.
Winning is necessary &amp; important. But, winning doesn’t happen without a plan, purpose, intent, &amp; a team that begins as individuals &amp; ends as family. If you show up &amp; hope to win, you never will. Trust the process &amp; navigate the path necessary to win.

I would like to give a huge thanks to the @KMHSathletics baseball team &amp; @mikelinch for having me out to speak tonight! Had a blast! Good luck this season!
Wow. Just wow. What a moment. Thanks to the @FMRedHawks I am an adopted MN sports fan. Love it! #skol https://t.co/kXd3GM6g8W
Every day, give thanks for wearing that uniform. Also, every day that you go out into the community, you should represent yourself with class, dignity, &amp; respect for the community you live in, the people that made this possible for you, and the uniform you’re so blessed to wear.
Excited to speak to the @KMHSathletics baseball team tonight with @mikelinch. Looking forward to a fun evening!
Bless because you’ve been blessed. Teach because you were taught. When we go through something, it’s easy to retreat. The world would change if we could take a step out of our situation to realize that we may be going through it so that we can help someone else through it later.
So much that we do OFF the field translates to success ON the field. Don't underestimate the power of early work, conditioning, weights, nutrition, &amp; rest, etc. We simply can’t just show up and expect excellence. It must be developed, built, &amp; sustained. Start. Right. Now.
Pitchers:  • The most important pitch in baseball isn't a 100 mph fastball or a knee buckling curve. It's strike one. Never downplay the power of getting ahead in the count. All you have to do is look at the opponent batting average when 0-1 versus 1-0. It’s astounding.
Being a team player means sacrificing your own numbers for the good of the team. Be selfless. Bunt, hit a sac fly, or move a runner over.   We &gt; Me
Thank you, @06BaseballMag (@gdcbaseball) for the opportunity to speak to the Georgia HS baseball coaches. Thankful for the opportunity &amp; encouraged by the amount of coaches who truly are hungry to learn all they can. Best of luck this season to everyone!
Too many kids get too much negative pressure from their parents when they leave you. Often, the most amount of positivity, love, &amp; encouragement they get in the entire week is from you. Coaches have an incredible platform that gives them the opportunity to change lives.
When you coach an athlete they may only wear your uniform for a short time. However, the impact you have is generational. These athletes will go out into the world, become parents, spouses, and friends. We have a chance to change family trees forever. Don't take that for granted.
If you think practice, fundamentals, hitting off a tee, bullpens, etc. are "a waste of time" I invite you to go check out a MLB Spring Training. You will see the best players in the world working hard daily to master the little things. Why? Doing the little things wins big games.
Mistakes happen. Don't fret. Perfection is unattainable. Take a deep breath and realize that often what matters most is how quickly you adjust &amp; correct the mistake.
People want to follow someone who has:  1) Integrity 2) A clear vision 3) Steady emotions 4) Empathy 5) Unshakable faith 6) Relentless optimism
Thanks to @gdcbaseball for having me today at the GA Baseball Coaches Clinic. Had a blast hanging with you guys &amp; speaking to you. Thankful for the opportunity.
Speaking this afternoon to all the high school baseball coaches in the state of Georgia. I’m honored, humbled, and excited. The topic today is creating a championship culture. Thanks, @gdcbaseball for this opportunity. See you soon!
Body language speaks louder than any words ever will. https://t.co/t1PWq2yECv
Culture is created by clarity. Have a vision &amp; let everyone else see it too. If we show up every day &amp; wander around aimlessly, tough times are on the horizon. Our team &amp; organization needs to know where we're going, but more importantly WHY they need to follow us there.
There are two types of criticism. One is crippling &amp; one is constructive. Leaders have the potential to shape the future of many people, but in order for that to happen there must be corrections &amp; criticism. Make sure it’s constructive. The truth, in love, is crucial for success.
Messing around and not taking practice seriously doesn't just affect you. Recognize the ripple effects of your actions. Be a team player.
Proud of you, @brandonmmann. The #Rangers are lucky to have you! #fmredhawks https://t.co/kdfhjSMXCn
If you want to make a difference in someone’s life, you have to actually get to know that person on a level that grants you permission to speak into their life. You can’t show up, speak up, &amp; expect them to listen. Love them before you lead them.
A leader who dismisses the thoughts or ideas of someone within the team or organization simply because they’re not as qualified or at the same level would make me question whether they’re even a leader at all. Being in charge, the coach, or the boss doesn’t mean you’re a leader.
Welcome Trevor Simms (@TASXXIV) to the @FMRedHawks family! Really excited to have this former @Dbacks prospect wearing our uniform for 2018. #fmredhawks  https://t.co/LNGHlyjcti
@jeanneparkcity @GullsClub Rarely does one just become great means you don’t just wake up one day and succeed at every single thing you do. It takes work &amp; progress. Nothing is handed to us.
@jeanneparkcity @GullsClub Lessons on the journey come from failure and success alike. When you overcome failure, you take strides. When you enjoy success, it keeps you going. Not a baseball lesson, a life lesson.
@jeanneparkcity @GullsClub Where did I mention baseball? Each person experiences ups and downs in whatever they do. Learning from shortcomings &amp; enjoying success is part of moving forward. It’s not being stuck in failure or gloating in success.
Really excited to connect with &amp; present to all the coaches this Friday at the @gdcbaseball clinic! We will be talking about building a championship culture. See y’all there!
There’s room for improvement every single day. Strive for greatness, but remember that rarely does one just become great. It’s a daily process that has its share of ups and downs. Take it one moment at a time. Give thanks for the success &amp; learn from the failures. Enjoy the ride.
The success or failure you’ll have on the field months from now is a direct reflection of your work ethic today. Make every moment count.
When @ChickfilA sends you free food vouchers to your app:  https://t.co/gRE5cCfCij
Many leaders get criticized for saying "no" too often. The truth is, the best leaders understand how saying "no" to something good leaves the door open to say "yes" to something great. Never ever settle.

. @JalenHurts got benched at halftime. Yet, he’s the one out there cheering the most &amp; supporting his teammates the loudest. That is what true leadership looks like. No attitude. No pouting. Just selflessness, team, &amp; positivity. Bravo. Kids, take notes. #nationalchampionship
Failure &amp; shortcomings, when approached with the right mindset, are nothing more than stumbling blocks that you use as stepping stones. Learn from, don’t dwell on these things. So often we run away from adversity thinking it’s bad for us when really it may be the fuel we need.
Now, only the #SuperBowl stands in the way of us and baseball...

How many people that accomplished something great never would’ve accomplished it had they let fear, anxiety, &amp; doubt win over their minds? My guess is close to zero. Accomplishing great things will have road blocks. Let the will to succeed be greater than the fear of failure.
Really excited to welcome @o19donnell to the @FMRedHawks family! Couldn’t be happier to have him on board. Patrick is coming off a record setting college career at @GoAugie &amp; also is a very high character individual! Welcome! #fmredhawks   https://t.co/2sSLOinapf
A coach has the opportunity to impact GENERATIONS! They may only wear your uniform a few short years at most, but the impact you can have on them is astounding. Keep perspective each day you interact with your team. These people will leave your team &amp; be shaped by your influence.
I’d like to introduce you to ballplayers all across the world who do that same thing. https://t.co/1OtOsxCWCJ
Excuses won’t exist in the same space as growth. Excuses are a crutch used to place blame &amp; ignore what we really need: improvement. If we’re honest with ourselves, excuses are simply our pride getting in the way of our progress. Champions don’t find excuses, they find a way.
Motion &amp; progress aren’t even close to the same thing. So many go through their days without a plan &amp; without purpose. We refer to this as “going through the motions.” Progress involves knowing what, why, &amp; when. Every moment is a chance to improve &amp; move ahead more wisely.
Most athletes feel enormous amounts of pressure at home or from their peers. It’s the culture we live in. Perfection. Attention. Fame. Coaches who flash their ego any chance they get only enhance the problem. Before you can lead, you have to serve. Know your athletes &amp; help them.
Before you can make your athletes believe in themselves, they have to see you believe in yourself. A coach with confidence issues puts that on display for all to see. It’s like the airplane oxygen mask theory: put yours on before assisting others.
Likewise. Some of the best memories I have in the game. https://t.co/QIi5Dq9Fot
You can plan every practice perfectly, strategize each game flawlessly, &amp; know all you want about what you coach. But, I assure you, if you can’t communicate properly, none of that will matter. Learn to communicate with your staff, your players, &amp; yourself. It’s essential.
If you’ve lost your passion for the game, a good starting point is to remember why you started playing the game in the first place. Much can be taken away from you, but your love for the sport isn't one of them. You may lose it, but it can -- and should -- be found.
We work out, train, run, prepare, &amp; plan for a season physically. How much work are we doing on the mental side? It’s understandable that the physical side needs to be in top shape, but if we’re not mentally prepared to compete then what’s the point?
Just like you wouldn’t follow someone who has zero idea where they’re going or why they’re even traveling, players won’t follow or listen to a coach with no vision or clear purpose for their team. Starting now, define your goals &amp; map out how you want to get there.
Teaching each player on your team the exact same way is what I refer to as "cookie cutter coaching." Remember, nobody is identical, and nobody learns the same way or at the same rate. The first step is to learn about each individual on your team.
@MarkAStrand @FMRedHawks Was the pitching coach from 2015-2017. Love Fargo. Excited to continue as manager in such a great place. My family is blessed to call Fargo our 2nd home.
@CoachTen23 @gdcbaseball Thanks Coach! Can’t wait!
One swing at a time, one pitch at a time, one inning at a time, one game at a time. We make things too complicated when we try to control too much on the field. Break it down into a series of ones. Focus &amp; be intentional with each &amp; every action you make. It’s a game changer.
Almost anyone can be given the title of coach. Few, however, will earn the title of leader. Coaches may show you how to get it done but leaders will come alongside you through it. Coaches teach in-game skills while leaders teach in-game skills that can be used in real life too.
Behind the scenes look at how I caught the attention of my wife back in high school: https://t.co/NWSRGtOsQ7
Playing baseball at the next level is not easy. If it was, anyone could play college ball or pro ball. Work hard to achieve your dreams. To achieve what only the top percent of people achieve you must do the little things correctly. Success is earned, not given.
The best leaders have a hand in everything the organization does &amp; of course, they call the final shots. However, delegating responsibility is huge. Not only does it help lessen the burden of work, it also gives those on your team a renewed sense of importance &amp; purpose.
Pitchers:  • Strike 1 is the best pitch in your arsenal. The higher your first pitch strike percentage, the higher your success rate will be.
A good baseball program is one that has a solid mission statement, clear goals, &amp; leadership that both guides &amp; motivates. Build it.
High school &amp; college baseball starts soon. What are you doing to prepare? The time is now to buckle up &amp; bear down.
I’m honored &amp; humbled, @KeithMadison32. Thank you. @ABCA1945 #ABCA2018 https://t.co/XXvSbSWTwl
Representing @NDSUfootball today! National Champions! Proud of y’all! https://t.co/rOn3zYpGv4
@THEcoltsedbrook Means a ton, man. We have an incredible platform doing what we do. Not many people can influence lives as directly as a coach. Huge blessing.
Coaches think legacy is in the number of championships they have or how many wins they have by their name. I believe a coach’s legacy is determined by how many lives they positively impact throughout their career. Keep focused on what TRULY matters &amp; you’ll always be successful.
That’s awesome! Thanks for sharing. https://t.co/rlxLnLcgIl
Too many pitchers throw their 0-2 pitch 2-0 and their 2-0 pitch 0-2. It’s mostly a mindset. Think of pitching to contact off the barrel to catch up or get a quick out when you’re down 2-0. Ahead 0-2, hunt for the strikeout. Put them away.
The best thing we can have in sports is a short term memory. This doesn’t mean that we ignore what happened. It means, for a short time, we reflect, research, &amp; often relearn in order to not make the same mistakes again. From there, we move ahead wiser &amp; with more confidence.
To lead well:  1) Practice what you preach.  2) Lose the ego &amp; serve them.   3) Have clear vision.  4) Have unshakable faith.  5) Know each team member.  6) Build their trust in you.  7) Remember you were once in their shoes.  8) Have their back &amp; never show them up.  9) Believe.
Coaches would prefer a group that’s LESS talented but works hard every day, gives it all they’ve got every time out &amp; acts like a family than a group that’s MORE talented yet selfish &amp; lazy. Guaranteed.
To all coaches attending #ABCA2018, soak up all you can. You can lose your job, your title, &amp; lots of other things. However, they can’t take your knowledge, instincts, and connections from you. Enjoy learning from the best. Don’t just listen, apply. @ABCA1945
Leaders are those people who walk in when all others are walking out. They don’t just tell you how to get through it, they are by your side through it. We should all strive to be that type of person. Life finds its meaning when you help others find their purpose.
If you show up &amp; give anything less than your best, you might as well go home. The path to success includes hard work, intent, determination, perseverance, faith, &amp; heart. Most of the world does exactly what’s expected. Stand out. Be different. Exceed expectations.

There’s a big difference between teams that have bonded off the field &amp; those who just show up &amp; go through the motions. Connecting your team personally means they play for each other before themselves. Your team quickly becomes a family. Set aside time to allow this to happen.

@xanbarksdale Or are blinded by this mix of denial/fake confidence to try &amp; push them through. We can tell in the pen ... sometimes just need that honest voice to remind us. Use. What. Works.
The best teams understand that whether you are the star or the last person that made the team, everyone plays an important role.   The best coaches understand that this isn’t a natural thing, so it needs to be taught, embraced, and cherished.

A few years ago, I took a trip to Puerto Rico with @UPIDiscipleship &amp; @TerryEvans17. We had a chance to spend some time with the Clemente family. I was blown away at their heart for others &amp; how they carried out Roberto’s legacy with such grace &amp; love. What a family.
Getting the most out of athletes is a top priority as a coach. However, if getting the most out of them means academically, personally, behaviorally, etc. I think you can consider it a success. Getting the most out of athletes doesn’t always mean on the field. Redefine success.
The great part about New Year’s Eve &amp; the celebration as the clock strikes 12 is that it signifies the turning of a page. A new start. A clean slate. It doesn’t matter where you’ve been or what mistakes you made. Declaring a fresh start is freeing &amp; exhilarating. Happy New Year!
Want to make a difference? Be positive. The world needs more of it, but so do those closest to you. It’s contagious, it’s uplifting, and it works. Find the silver lining in every situation today, no matter how hard it is. I bet you’ll feel better, more blessed, &amp; happier.
This was, without a doubt, the highlight of 2017. How can this be topped? https://t.co/ZCkga2E4jj
Pitchers must step on the mound with conviction, confidence, and control. Taking the ball, getting the sign, and saying “I hope this is the right pitch” will rarely work out. Have a plan, give each pitch a purpose, and pitch with passion.
One of the many benefits of building a positive, championship culture within your team or organization is that you'll have a team full of players who have short-term goals, long-term aspirations, and huge dreams.
As an athlete, when you finally step on a field with a "I know I can" attitude instead of a "I hope I can" attitude, everything will change.

@JonAcuff @jillian_schlact &amp; I share two gigs!! We have rollover usually too!
“Because I said so” is an easy way to spot a coach who is either caught up in the power the title brings or they actually have no idea what they’re talking about. Coaching and teaching are the same. Don’t just say words, let them mean something &amp; teach something.
Coaches that forget how hard the game was to play are on a fast track to losing credibility &amp; trust with their team. No one likes to hear “throw strikes” or “just hit the ball” or anything else like that. Perfection is unattainable. Excellence, however, can be demanded.
The first step towards finding your purpose in life is to help others find their purpose.
The baseball life is a crazy life. We stay up late &amp; sleep late. We travel anywhere &amp; everywhere. We pack our car &amp; move for months at a time just to pack up &amp; do it all over again. The memories we make &amp; the laughs we share will last a lifetime. So thankful for them, &amp; for this. https://t.co/KNaOOahK8m
Who you surround yourself with, who you associate with, and who you hang with are all little parts of how you’ll be perceived. Make sure every day that you take a running inventory of whether those in your circle have your best interests in mind or not. Your future depends on it.

@Jasinjuh Yep.
@jasonhoates Could be fun, but also it’s necessary. As a coach I want players who want to learn regardless of fun. To a certain age it should absolutely be fun (to keep attention span &amp; to learn to love the game) Around HS age it gets real.
@Luke_Murton @jasonhoates Good point Luke. But you have 280 characters now so you don’t have to speak in code. That’s SO 2017.
So many athletes complain about practice. They complain about fundamentals. They complain about the weather. They complain about anything. Be different. Complaining gets you nowhere. Realize that practice is essential to success, fundamentals are foundational, &amp; positivity works.

The absolute last thing your athlete needs is to be criticized after a game. A bad performance doesn't mean they're a bad person. What they need most from you is love, acceptance, and someone to remind them that what they do IS NOT who they are.
It's almost 11 pm and I'm wandering aimlessly around my house because I have to reach my goal. #Fitbit
If you call it a grind, I would venture to say you don’t love what you’re doing. Waking up every day &amp; finding joy, purpose, &amp; pleasure in what you do should never ever cause you to refer to it as a grind.
Being a leader on the field doesn’t always mean you’re the loudest or the most vocal. Often, leading is by example. In this case, no words need to be spoken.

@jonbarth11 Amen. Also a very good point.
Fear on the field is a product of feeling unprepared or thinking you're unqualified. Confidence is born from preparation, hard work, and believing that you're better than the opponent.
Players need accountability from their teammates, information from their coaches, &amp; love from their families. This is the beginning recipe for success on and off the field.
Highly highly recommend you join us! Don’t miss out! https://t.co/g7PW52PeYZ
Every time you step on a field you’re representing yourself, your family, your coach, &amp; your team. The quickest way to lose an opportunity to play — or to be on the team — is to act in a way that damages those things. Remember that if you want to be a pro you should act like one.

Discipline is formed and character is forged through adversity. Most people have been told that it's better to run from adversity than it is to embrace it. The truth is that when we run from adversity, we're never refined from it. Growth happens when there are setbacks.

We all have a platform. Some have baseball fields &amp; a team. Some have a child at home, but all of us have someone looking to us. No platform is too big or too small to lead. The heart of a leader has a heart for each person under their guidance. Don't take that for granted.
The people who pushed through adversity and overcame obstacles are the ones who developed an unmatched strength &amp; unrelenting determination. They stand out. Don’t shy away from that which scares you. Face it head on.

Strive to build a program that focuses on developing great people &amp; great athletes. Championships are great but they’re also temporary. Molding high quality individuals that impact the world &amp; those around them in a positive way should be the focus. The rest is icing on the cake.
Talent takes you to a certain point, but even talent has a ceiling. Those who continue to improve &amp; move up the ladder are the ones who understand that it's earned, not given. Work ethic, character, grit, &amp; heart aren't put on your baseball card, but they're essential to success.
A team with a championship mindset is full of athletes who think of teammates before themselves. They have grit, determination, &amp; perseverance. They show up every day with confidence, knowing that they’ve put the work in &amp; that results are a product of the process.
We’re not that different after all! https://t.co/WqWHNi983U

A championship culture is the result of a day to day commitment to be the absolute best in absolutely every way. Excellence is contagious. Spread it around.
Some days feel just like this. https://t.co/JHs8SLZJfk
Most authority figures (coaches, teachers, parents) will stay on you &amp; push you to be the best you can be. They’re not doing this to upset you, they’re doing it to get the most out of you. Those who have walked your path &amp; fought your battles can share wisdom for your journey.

Baseball, in general, hasn’t changed in many years. How we play the game, the science behind the game, &amp; the way we look at, analyze, &amp; use statistics has. Don’t be stuck in your ways because “it’s how I did it back in my day.” Be open to using new information when coaching.

The only reason we should look back at our past is to learn something. There’s no time to dwell on it. Moving forward &amp; looking ahead is too integral &amp; critical to be burdened by things that are behind you. Learning from your past is much different than being burdened by it.
@chriscoste27 Agreed. Or, remove yourself from claiming a side &amp; look solely at the candidate and what they stand for. Voting simply because you claim a side is an interesting thought. I’ve always been an issue guy rather than a “side” guy.

Shying away from the truth as a coach because you’re trying to protect an athlete’s feelings may be a short term “gain” but it’s absolutely a long term loss for both you &amp; them. Teach them how to receive, process, &amp; work through constructive criticism &amp; caring critiques.

@KeithTVGuy Y’all were right. I was at my gate from Newman in 6 minutes. @FMRedHawksGM https://t.co/Nm4aenzN2J
Very excited to welcome @chriscoste27 as the @FMRedHawks hitting coach. He made his professional debut here in Fargo &amp; persevered all the way to winning a World Championship with the @Phillies. Couldn’t be happier to have him on board.
Your coach isn’t expecting perfection each time out. They are, however, expecting accountability, hard work, &amp; an eagerness to improve on whatever it is that’s holding you back. Make improvements, not excuses.
A uniform, playing time, &amp; reputation are things that must be earned over time. The thing you must remember about these three is that one bad decision can take all of them away. Don’t lose in a second what’s taken you years to earn.
I told myself when I retired from playing in August of 2014 that I was going to take a year off from working out/running. That turned into 3. I just downloaded couch to 5K. Figured it’s as good a time as any to get back in shape. It’s never too late &amp; you’re never too far gone.
We rarely learn when we're experiencing success. The reason is because we just cruise along &amp; never think twice. When failures comes into our lives, it causes us to pause, reflect, &amp; think about how to correct the issues that cause it. Bottom line: failure is a great teacher.
If you want JOY, keep these in order:  J esus O thers Y ourself  (@mikelinch)
When you wake up, make sure you set clearly before you both vision and purpose for your day. We rarely go into the unknown without a GPS. The same goes for your day. Know exactly what you want before your feet hit the ground for maximum efficiency &amp; confidence moving forward.
Too many parents put their unrealistic expectations &amp; unrealized dreams on their kids. It’s unfair &amp; sets them up for undue pressure. Sports can teach amazing life lessons if you’ll allow them to.
@Minceymp If you can look yourself in the mirror over the course of a week &amp; say with complete certainty that you can retire — with zero regrets or doubts — you may be ready. Never make an emotional decision. Pray, think, ponder, pray, &amp; then decide. Emotions cause rash decisions.
@bschu7 @FMRedHawks I’m pumped too!!!
Talent takes you there, work ethic keeps you there. Never settle for, “I made it.” Strive for improvement daily.
@DomIzzoWDAY I live about 5 minutes from Kennesaw State. Maybe I should come up to Fargo if they play. I’ll just rep my @FMRedHawks gear to stay somewhat neutral.
Rather than complaining about each &amp; every situation, remember there are people &amp; places all across the world that have WAY less than you and me. Give thanks &amp; give back.
Allowing the emotion of defeat to teach a lesson is part of the growing up process. Too many try and protect their athletes from that. Winning and losing is part of the game &amp; part of life. Better to learn how to handle it earlier than later.
It’s best to leave critiquing and coaching to the coach. When your kid leaves the game, maybe try saying, “I love watching you play” or “enjoyed seeing you out there today.” Piling on criticism isn’t the way to go. Sometimes, caring means letting them learn from someone else.
You can COACH without actually knowing your players, but you’ll never be able to LEAD them until you’ve learned their story. Remember, coach is just a title. Leader is a quality &amp; description.
Just like you wouldn’t trust anyone who seems fake &amp; doesn’t have your best interests in mind, nor will your athletes. The best way to truly lead is to be completely authentic. Athletes are craving someone who they KNOW has their back .... win or lose.
Setbacks are a setup for a comeback. God is using EVERYTHING for good. Stand firm in your faith today.   #SpiritualCaffeine https://t.co/3mAo2MXdWw
You CANNOT want it more than your kid if you’re the parent of an athlete. At some point, they’ll either get burned out or grow to hate the sport you want them to love if you force it. Instead of shoving them towards your sport, support them in their sport, whatever it may be.
@JasonRomano Christmas Shoes
@chriscauley @JasonRomano Simply. Having. A wonderful Christmastime.
As a coach, screaming at players isn’t going to make them want to work harder, play better, or show up to the field for that matter. Each athlete has an individual personality. Therefore, it’s wise to actually get to know them to know how to motivate them.
This is really encouraging today. You don’t have to be what “they” want you to be to be used by God.   #SpiritualCaffeine https://t.co/WeOk7rl7GX

Fear is an emotion that shows up when you feel unprepared, unqualified, or undeserving. Counter fear by working hard, learning a lot, and having confidence in your abilities. Eliminating fear is truly freeing.
The deciding factor between a team that rises to the occasion or doesn’t is one word: grit.   How you &amp; the team handle adversity will make all the difference in the outcome of the season. Let it drive you, don’t let it defeat you.
“If your visions and dreams don’t involve making others better, you need bigger and bolder visions &amp; dreams.”  {@JonGordon11}
I highly recommend you all to follow @Sports_Spectrum. Athletes &amp; people in sports are sharing their stories that I guarantee you won’t see anywhere else.
Work ethic &amp; character is something that is often born in times of failure. Hiding, preventing, or protecting people from failure doesn’t allow them to develop the right things necessary to combat what life will throw at them. Enjoy success &amp; learn from failure.
A sad reality in youth sports is that so often the parent wants it way more than the athlete. What ends up happening 9/10 times is the kid ends up resenting the sport &amp; quitting or resenting the parent. Kids will work harder &amp; have more fun doing something they want to do.
Those who are successful at what they do were never forced to work hard or told to get going. There is an inner burning desire to work, improve, &amp; keep moving ahead. Adversity &amp; triumph mix together to fuel them on their way.
Few people can relate &amp; resonate with your successes. Many can relate &amp; resonate with your failures. Being vulnerable &amp; leading from humility goes a long way when connecting with others. Nobody is perfect. Expecting perfection does nothing but cause unnecessarily pressure.
A coach will help you learn how to get through it. A leader will walk with you through it. The world needs more leaders.
@JonGordon11 @DavidtheAdmiral @c3hoosier Looking forward to meeting you this week at @The_Increase. Thanks for sharing some of your time with us.
Any time I’m in Texas I go to @rudysbbq. The best part is seeing other people like @JasonRomano, @brandoncoker, &amp; @chriscauley share my passion of good bbq. Glad we’re on the same page, boys.
The difference between average &amp; great isn't always talent level. Some of the most average players succeed because of extraordinary work ethic &amp; strong character.
With the right mindset, a loss is nothing more than a chance to regroup &amp; move ahead more wisely. You will always learn more from adversity than you will smooth sailing. Embrace it. Use it. Be motivated by it.

One of the biggest issues I’ve come across in youth sports is that kids don’t know how to fail. There aren’t winners and losers anymore. A vital part of life is learning how to navigate, handle, &amp; overcome adversity. Your kids will learn a lot more from failure than from success.

There is much to be thankful for, but often it’s easier to think of what burdens us. Take some time to sit &amp; think about the true blessings in your life over the next few days. You won’t regret it a bit.
Happy Birthday to one of the greatest coaches in the history of the game, @cobbbuckyball. A @CobberBaseball, @MoorheadBlues, &amp; @FMRedHawks legend. I’m so thankful to have been blessed to have been able to watch him in the dugout and have him as a mentor &amp; friend.
If you are gifted athletically &amp; are part of a team, give thanks. Thousands would trade places with you in an instant. Far too often, we take our gifts &amp; talents for granted. Open your eyes and look around. Not many can do what you do.
Every single day that you work hard to improve, you’re investing in yourself. At the end of the day, you are a brand. Represent yourself well.
Hey, John from Idaho, sorry. You won’t find a salad at my house for Thanksgiving. Jimmy from Sheboygan? You’re in luck, kid.
If you live in the west, do I even know you?! https://t.co/h4IpelFBXW
People leaving LA for Thanksgiving kinda looks like the @trailblazers logo. https://t.co/9ruba7yNNY
Maybe one of the greatest worship songs ever written. @brandoncoker penned a gem here. Take a listen: https://t.co/5UgP2s0VMg
I listened to the lyrics for “baby it’s cold outside” today for the first time. That dude was controlling. Hopefully she left even though it was up to her knees out there.
Can someone tell me what happened to #80? Please? @HarrisIII? Anyone? https://t.co/ORreAWEKsl
I'm amazed at the number of athletes that truly believe they can just show up and be successful. That may work for a while, but over time and in the end, those who work hard to master their craft will keep on succeeding. Never settle for "it's good enough."
Y’all should grab some @FMRedHawks gear for you &amp; a friend. Thanks for supporting us. We look forward to seeing you at Newman Outdoor &amp; all around the country next summer! https://t.co/P6u445KkB4
Just watched the @GeorgiaDome get imploded. The most fascinating part is that @MBStadium is only 30 yards away.  https://t.co/I4bjayneJ5
It’s Sunday so I know y’all are missing Chick-Fil-A. Watch this instead. You won’t be disappointed. A Chick-Fil-A rap.  https://t.co/ocN2WXKgo0
My pastor &amp; friend @mikelinch delivered one of the most powerful sermons I’ve heard. The series was called “The Chase” &amp; it’ll make you realign your priorities &amp; rethink your lifestyle. Highly recommend you find time &amp; make time to watch this. https://t.co/YycBaFMbJT
Our Christmas tree is up early because it’s especially loved by our son and is very special to us. Each member of our family gets a new ornament every year, and each one tells a story or represents our year in some way. Very thankful for Jesus Christ &amp; the blessings in our lives. https://t.co/m8AdtogbAr
Sometimes, for pitchers, that extra run can be shaved off the ERA by doing things like holding runners &amp; fielding comebackers correctly. Don’t neglect the PFP portion of your game. It’s just as important over the course of a season.
Just keep the sinks with handles, stores. These “touchless” ones hurt my self-esteem. I end up waving my hands around like a weirdo for 10 minutes before resorting to my son’s pack of baby wipes.
@JSipper_WDAY I grew up with Sean McVay in Georgia. We went to elementary school together. Tell him what’s up! Haha
Each baseball player is unique. Don't conform to "cookie cutter mechanics" because some coach tells you that's how it should be. Be you.
Lots of talking and lots of words don't always mean lots of coaching is taking place. Motion and progress aren't the same thing.
Put yourself in the shoes of the college coach or pro scout. Would they want you on their team? Would they sign you to their organization? Set goals &amp; work to become the type of person that’s worth taking a risk on.
@injuryexpert @NewbergReport I went about 10 years ago and I’ve never met more faithful fans &amp; a more committed group of people than Rangers fans &amp; the @NewbergReport
@daviddeweil Fa la la la la la la la la
He ages well. https://t.co/OTcMtPWXoD
... now I’ve just witnessed a lady recording herself run a 5K with a long selfie stick. This is the age we live in, folks.
@duck0925 Pitching is a series of short, explosive actions. So, therefore, (overall) I embrace sprint work. Haha.
I’m still baffled that people choose to wake up early in the morning to .... run. Like, for fun. Early. In the morning.
Playing at the next level isn't solely based around on-field performance. Make sure you present yourself well in public &amp; on social media.
@bottlerocket Put a Taco Salad Shell in your local brook until a beaver makes a home. Then take it out of the water and place as the centerpiece of your table.
Changing the culture of an entire organization or team starts with changing the attitude of one person. So often we want to have a big influence, without being willing to influence one person at a time.
Happy for Cleve. The @Wingnuts_ICT have a good one at the helm! https://t.co/u46yUJ1bUR
@injuryexpert Age of the smartphone. Distraction while waiting. Red lights, lines, etc.
@HarrisIII when you're in St. Paul make sure you stop and eat at Key's. Amazing.
The best way to keep a competitive edge in your sport is to remember that whatever you play, wherever you play, &amp; despite the success you’re having, someone else is working their tail off to take your spot on the team or in the sport. Never settle.
This is literally heart-wrenching. https://t.co/Ae71wczKUs
The moment you feel that a starting role is your right rather than something you achieved or earned, you've taken two steps back. There is always someone waiting who would give anything to take that spot. Play with urgency, confidence, &amp; a desire to improve every single day.
Anything in life worth attaining won't come easily. It takes great dedication, perseverance, skill, &amp; work ethic to play at the next level.
Happiest of birthdays to the voice of the @FMRedHawks, Mr. @JackTrackItDown!
@LesParrott @RachelCruze Thank you for the Every Dollar stream of the Money &amp; Marriage Conference tonight! It was wonderful!
Placing blame &amp; shifting responsibility is NOT leading. That’s called being in charge &amp; deciding to deflect. Leading is taking responsibility &amp; taking ownership of everyone under your umbrella of care.
Always be a student of the game. Pay attention when you're playing, watch when you're on the bench, &amp; take notes when you're watching MLB.
Pitchers:  •The most important pitch you'll throw all game is strike one. Don't underestimate the power of pitching ahead in the count.
If you want to be a better all around player, begin by watching &amp; listening to those around you that are better all around players.
Each baseball player has unique talents &amp; abilities. While it's necessary to watch others to learn, know yourself. Embrace your gifts.
The best teammates are ones who care more about the welfare of the team than of themselves.
Coaches:  •Rules without relationships create rebellion. Care before you coach.
If you’re having trouble getting your athletes to “buy in” to what you’re doing, make sure the goals are attainable &amp; the vision is clear. Small, attainable goals over time add up to huge gains &amp; a clear vision is essential to showing them the way.
The higher you go in baseball, the quicker the game moves. Don't get overwhelmed. Prepare yourself fundamentally, mentally, and physically.
@JasonRomano We will all be there! Can’t wait.
Really really happy for you. I know many lives will change for the better! https://t.co/VsMmmDw0t6
If we spent half as much time working to fix the situation as we do complaining about it, think of how far we’d go.
Coaching at the next level means looking at more than just what a player does on the field. Playing at the next level means realizing that you're a brand, representing yourself with pride &amp; class, and acting like a professional in every phase of your life.
It's so easy to talk through situations that are tough. It's so hard to walk through situations that are tough. When the walk and the talk line up, people take notice. Be a light everywhere you go.
Happy for Sean McVay &amp; all his success with the @RamsNFL. https://t.co/Mo1TQyxuAI
Baffles me that people applaud coach firings. These are jobs. People’s careers. Families affected. Let’s have more sensitivity. Reminder that people don’t applaud your company when you get let go.
Teams that fall apart have a serious lack in leadership. A team that functions properly understands that cohesiveness &amp; culture start at the top but are carried out by each &amp; every person on the team. No one’s role is too little to play a part.
This is a great article about the Turnover Chain. A small thing can lead to big results when the leaders emphasize what’s important.   We &gt; Me   https://t.co/jXt5Yt2kNX
Amen to this. @mikematheny22 https://t.co/htShsQMOm7
The beautiful thing about today is that yesterday is over. If it was a good day, give thanks. If it was a tough day, learn from it. Either way, today is a new day. Embrace and enjoy it.
Everyone has a role. Some are starters and some come off the bench. Whatever your role, embrace it &amp; do it well for the good of the team.
When I can’t decide between @DunkinDonuts or @Starbucks.  https://t.co/vcOHqWfevi
The Turnover Chain is a perfect example of a simple thing that brings a team together &amp; creates a positive culture. Coaches, it's not hard to create a place where the athlete wants to show up, wants to compete, and wants to win not only for themselves .. but for their teammates.
As you move to higher levels in baseball, how you act &amp; present yourself is how your "brand" is represented. Want to be a pro? Act like one.
We are honored @ahsbucsbaseball. Thank you. https://t.co/LNizvL0o1z
Wow! https://t.co/9LQ7k0tCez
To all veterans: thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for protecting me, my family, and this great country. Thank you for running in when everyone else is running out. Thank you for being strong, selfless, &amp; sacrificing so much for many you’ll never even meet. 🇺🇸
@JSipper_WDAY Nah, I’ll pass. It’s 48 here in Atlanta and I’m staying inside
It must be backwards day. https://t.co/laEERWyx2l
Being part of the team means buying into the culture &amp; the character of the team from day one. Encourage, persevere, work, believe, &amp; enjoy.
@KeithTVGuy I’m so sad now. I’m going to eat a snow-cone &amp; sit under an umbrella.
@KeithTVGuy I felt 16 once. Once. It was breaking news. People stayed inside for 4 days. Panic. Sheer panic.
It’s 55 degrees today. I’m wearing shorts. Until that temp has a 3 or a 4 in front of it, I’m holding out. It’s summertime somewhere...
@TheRealJHair @gabekapler He looks like the @UnderArmour mannequin.
We can't just show up &amp; be successful. The work, determination, &amp; dedication put in during the winter affects the success during the summer.
I feel blessed to be a part of independent baseball with the @FMRedHawks. We exist to give the former @MiLB or @MLB guy a chance to get back &amp; we give guys who missed the @MLBDraft a chance to get a foot into professional baseball. Thankful for the opportunity to be a part of it.
Embrace &amp; give thanks for the leader in your life that shows you tough love &amp; gives you constructive criticism. It's the best thing for you.
When a baseball player passes &amp; you hear stories of his compassion, grit, competitiveness, love, and genuine care for everyone he ever met ... you know that individual did MUCH more than just play a game. Rest In Peace, @RoyHalladay.
@Star_enilnO No problem.
@TopVelocity @TCDriller99 @mikenextlevel @mikereinold @CoachKsAcademy @Parqman40 Not true.
@OneGun45 Truth.
. @MLBNetworkRadio is doing an honorary show about Roy Halladay. Callers are telling stories, hosts are talking about experiences, and everyone is celebrating his life. What a wonderful thing to be able to listen to.
@TerryEvans17 @MaTaylor24 Both of you need to get to @BURGERFI immediately.
Really pumped for @BanksGriffith for signing today with @FurmanBaseball! Love that we have a family that loves baseball so much! Following in the footsteps of your brothers @ryangriffith18 &amp; @SimmerJimmer7! Really pumped for you &amp; your future!
@saltdogsball @railcats Oh snap
Love this. Times have changed ... https://t.co/TW2ZZx1INs
#BlackFriday should consist of sleeping in &amp; then spending the day with family &amp; friends. An overflow from Thanksgiving if you will. Consumerism isn’t bad, but it shouldn’t be the focus of the holiday season either, in my opinion. Things are gone in a flash. Love people.
The truth is that none of us truly know how much time we have left. This should cause us to embrace every second &amp; cherish time with our loved ones. Don’t take a single second for granted. What means the most aren’t always the milestone moments, but the little ones too.
The @FMRedHawks &amp; I are saddened by the sudden passing of RHP Richie Mirowski. He was a great pitcher, but more importantly, he was a great person. I was blessed to get to know him over the last few years. Rest In Peace, Ski Ski. https://t.co/tmlNOERSdI
I wanted to pitch like Roy Halladay. Then, when I saw what type of man he was, I wanted to be like him too. Devastated. Rest In Peace, Doc.
Halladay reached @MLB, was sent back to SINGLE A, &amp; rather than letting it defeat &amp; define him, he allowed it to fuel him on his road back.
Not many 2-time Cy Young winners &amp; 8-Time @MLB All-Stars invest in young baseball players like Halladay did. A classy final tweet to remember &amp; honor such a great pitcher &amp; person. https://t.co/UFKCLSH7yf
Roy Halladay embodied fire, determination, grit, &amp; character. He believed in hard work &amp; mastering his craft. Even more than all of this, he was an amazing person off the field. Rest In Peace. https://t.co/d42BLWXtYy
Jeez. https://t.co/0vY3jhGhQZ
I’m watching paint dry &amp; waiting for the baseball season. These two are basically the same thing. https://t.co/4wmaTaahk8
@drivelinebases When what you do works, what you do is wanted.
Does anyone take the time to review a product or place after a good experience? I can’t read those. Never an accurate representation.
@idaho_panhandle Yeah, I guess that’s true too. Ha
@abraves277 @tpike10 Good point.
@ShannonOnTheFly Hahaha
@BenjBowman Allegedly.
@Sweettweetee Yep! New baby! Due in March. We’re so excited!
For perspective, IKEA is my nightmare &amp; anything with instructions are my nemesis. Art/painting? I didn’t even get the “nice try award.”
I’m painting the new baby’s room today. If you know me, you’re already laughing. If this looks halfway normal, hallelujah!
Don’t forget to set your clocks back &amp; enjoy that extra hour of sleep ... unless you’re the parent of a toddler. In that case, continue on.
Well this really escalated quickly.
People can relate to your setbacks &amp; shortcomings much more than your successes. Be real. Be vulnerable. Be yourself.
@MattWalshBlog You’ll love it there. Stop by the @FMRedHawks front office &amp; @FMRedHawksGM will get you a hat!
We don’t tell our stories of setbacks &amp; failures because we’re scared of what people may think, forgetting it may be just what they need.
... and goodbye to your savings. https://t.co/ZxsSf1qHc6
@Kevin_Goldstein Really happy for you man, what an amazing accomplishment!
I’ll be on with @JackTrackItDown at 1:15 pm ET talking @FMRedHawks baseball, #WorldSeries baseball, &amp; more! https://t.co/SwewhGcqaX
This was a Sports Illustrated cover in 2014. Remarkable. #WorldSeries https://t.co/OrKkOUyNmN
Congratulations to the @astros for winning the #WorldSeries. Well deserved &amp; a lot of fun to watch! What a series &amp; what a season it was!
I'm thankful this went into November, because that's one month closer to Spring Training. But, tomorrow, I'll wake up sad. #WorldSeries
Rest In Peace Rick Hadar, better known around @MiLB as Myron Noodleman. Entertained thousands nightly &amp; was one of the nicest people around.
Happy November! A new month, a fresh start, &amp; a clean slate! Whatever happened in the past should be learned from but not dwelled on.
One of the highlights of my career -- I was amazed after the first one and speechless after the second. @FMRedHawks https://t.co/I83IkAS2Rm
I can pretty much guarantee you we'll never see that in person again. https://t.co/7FXCkxcgF5
A coach teaches you how to, while a leader walks with you through it.
A must win game has a combination of nerves, confidence, &amp; excitement. Trust what got you here but leave it all on the field. #WorldSeries
Win or go home. Win and go home. Just, go home. #Game7 #WorldSeries
The only thing this #WorldSeries needed was a game 7 to make it one of the best of all time. Well, here we are. November baseball, everyone!
This is phenomenal.   Tickets to #WorldSeries: $5,000.  Parking: $50.  Enjoying a froyo? Priceless. https://t.co/nmtObMBgcO
I bet Smoltz and Buck would voluntarily give up their mics so Vin Scully could announce game 7, right? Right? RIGHT?! #WorldSeries
CHIP &amp; JOANNA!!!! https://t.co/ccy43zSCyU
Altuve didn't get chosen either and look how he turned out... #WorldSeries https://t.co/XNA3yrOT6P
Of course a 7 pitch inning helps this not be necessary...
Kenley Jansen may be the setup guy tonight. In a must win game I wouldn't sleep on the closer being .... Kershaw. #WorldSeries

I don't want to call kids today lazy, but I watched a herd of them Uber from house to house while Trick or Treating.
Justin Turner spoils pitches with the best of them. I guarantee you his career turnaround happened around the time he learned to do this.
There are few things prettier in baseball than a hitter that knows how to hit with a two strike approach. #WorldSeries
Rich Hill is not a poor sport for showing emotion in the dugout. On the contrary. He’s a competitor. A gamer. A fighter. #WorldSeries
Brandon Morrow’s arm must be made out of the same material that Stretch Armstrong is made out of.  Game on the line right here. Quick hook.
*Buys lots of candy.  *Convinces wife it’ll be SO busy.  *Wife takes kid trick or treating.   *Turns off lights &amp; eats all the candy.  🎃
Happy Halloween from Lightning McQueen's driver! https://t.co/epm21K1e5d
Coaches try &amp; act like they're perfect &amp; never fail. Be relatable. Take some pressure off. Remind them you haven't forgotten how hard it is.
This is a prime example of why arm speed, arm slot, &amp; mechanics need to be identical throughout. (🎥 @PitchingNinja) https://t.co/kJWRQpTm59

Circle change, John. #WorldSeries
I'll be out trick-or-treating dressed up as Bill Miller's strike zone. Now THAT'S scary. #WorldSeries
Run hard out of the box, always. That extra 90 feet could turn out to be HUGE. #WorldSeries
This entire #WorldSeries is like when you turn on the PS4 and play MLB The Show with your buddy and the difficulty is on rookie.
You will, as it's been said, never see it all in this game. Love it. #WorldSeries
12 times in 13 games will do this. Morrow's arm has to be hanging. Can't even imagine. #WorldSeries
What. Is. Happening. #WorldSeries https://t.co/eHUr43f1z7
You make an error, you lead off. That's baseball. Been that way since I was 8 years old. Love it. #WorldSeries

Have to keep the ball in front of you right there, no matter what. Understand wanting to be the hero, but... #WorldSeries

I'll take it back to Little League here, but with two strikes and an ump with a zone shaped like an amoeba -- shouldn't you at least swing?
Seager didn't like this much... #WorldSeries https://t.co/31lexlxWy5
Me, this entire #WorldSeries thus far. https://t.co/IQq0OuNIW5
The #RedSox come from behind #WorldSeries championship has to be #1, but this series is already trying to be the greatest of all time.
@DevanFink I've heard personally from guys who thought there was a difference. Not sure what to make of it. If they want the casual fan to watch, bingo
@DevanFink That was half a joke, I don't know. I guess when multiple guys from both teams are complaining, it's hard to ignore.
Slippery balls. #WorldSeries https://t.co/mfC0dJkGY1
@drivelinebases @Jordan_Dean1 @Cody_Bellinger All the time ... as you know everything is magnified in the World Series. Especially in this social media/couch manager age...
@MeLlamoTrevor Mom's spaghetti/there's something on my sweater already...
@robgreene Mostly, yeah. Ha. This series is just way to back and forth to not be exciting.
@MeLlamoTrevor yep https://t.co/Ssm9kSFKbg
It's past your bedtime. Goodnight. #WorldSeries https://t.co/shfnMYvbDy
The players play the game, but having a manager that makes you want to run through a wall sets the tone to NEVER EVER QUIT. #WorldSeries
@Cody_Bellinger Yep.
Wow, baseball. You’re the best. What a series. #WorldSeries
For the record, this is what a positive clubhouse culture looks like. Props to Dave Roberts for creating and continuing this. #WorldSeries https://t.co/mT2I9VNYTo
When turning a double play, it's the runner's job to get out of the way. The INF is taught to throw regardless. #Ouch #WorldSeries
Looking forward to speaking at the @fargo_post2 Hall of Fame Banquet! Thanks for the opportunity &amp; excited to meet all of you! @FMRedHawks https://t.co/lgz4rIGbHr
Looking forward to this &amp; excited for the opportunity to share with all of you! https://t.co/jjuxsw3Gzi
Body language is heard loudest of all &amp; doesn’t even make a sound. Work on it.
Really exciting times! The @FMRedHawks schedule will be released next week! Excited for 2018 &amp; can’t wait to see you @ Newman Outdoor Field!
. @FMRedHawksGM has no idea what is about to happen. Can’t wait, @ChickfilA! @FMRedHawks https://t.co/X52YibKhAt
People never remember the critic, only the hero. The best part is that you can silence a critic without ever opening your mouth.
Love that everyone was ragging @Cody_Bellinger for his 0 for #WorldSeries until last night. The best ones know to keep fighting &amp; stay calm.
This article also announces Andy Haines to the #Cubs. He started as an independent ball manager! Never give up. https://t.co/w2DDwCIWWK
Yelling “throw strikes” or “hit the ball” is pointless. Sorry. You’ve forgotten how tough the game is &amp; lost sight of how to help a player.
Good forward thrust of the head to eject the gum with plus downhill plane. https://t.co/Lef1GcsfVi
I have a coaching tutorial for you. Here it is: Never ever forget how hard it was to play the game. Congrats, you graduated.
@drivelinebases The ole smile and nod. Love it.
You can go 0-22 in a postseason series and still be a hero. Don't panic, don't give up, and don't get down. Stay calm &amp; stay focused.
#WorldSeries https://t.co/NdtY73LUdy
Sometimes you have to sit down with a guy &amp; remind him of what he did to help us get to where we are. Reboot that confidence &amp; restart.
You wouldn't know that Dave Roberts isn't one of the players by watching how he reacts and gets fired up. Love that. #WorldSeries
Fine line between not wanting to burst the confidence of your closer &amp; realizing that you MAY just need to remove them from that role.
@MikePinto3 Can't be sitting on your hands when the game enters that timeframe though, that's for sure.
@str8edgeracer He's awesome and hysterical.
@MikePinto3 Those who introduce a knew sequence, adjustment, pitch, etc third time through obviously are better pitchers &amp; go further. Hard to do...
@Rene_Taubensee Duh, knew that already!!
@MikePinto3 Obviously, the 3rd time through isn't cut and dry, but more times than not it seems to be the turning point in the game for the starters.
Watching @SU2C during the #WorldSeries reminds me how brutal cancer really is. EVERYONE in that stadium was affected. Some more than once.
We’ve arrived. 3rd time through the lineup. Typically starters either can or cannot at this point in the game. #WorldSeries
Velocity can be taught after a pitcher learns to command the baseball &amp; he takes off. If velocity is in place &amp; he has no command? Not good.
That changeup Morton just threw? Perfect. Arm speed, location, execution. Hitters stand little chance when a pitcher perfects that pitch.
Good bloodlines. #ScoutTalk https://t.co/iAruCZmQpA
"Elite" sports teams aren't always necessary until the kid is closing in on college/pro sports. Learn the fundamentals &amp; life lessons. https://t.co/1oCeoYI8kz
Baseball, overall, is a beautiful picture of people from all walks of life coming together &amp; working together towards a common goal.

I’m legitimately wondering if any sized bird can do this, or was it a pterodactyl? https://t.co/jCZa42n10N
It’s great to dream of playing sports at the next level. But, if it stays a dream &amp; there’s never action to attain it, what good is it?
Most won’t agree, but the best baseball is a pitcher’s duel/close game. Not a slugfest. Masterful sequences &amp; off balance swings for life.
This pretty much played out tonight. #WorldSeries #EarnHistory https://t.co/uqO2UBeA4b
@drivelinebases @PitchMechanics @PitchingNinja @OneGun45 Love how in stadiums across America I come out of a tunnel &amp; into the dugout to hear a loud "WHAM" of the starting pitcher's weighted balls.
Because baseball. #WorldSeries https://t.co/BOeyPs49yu
Chicken Strip knew that was a 408 foot out! #WorldSeries https://t.co/25Li5gsQOj
I'm sorry, did you say .982? Wow. https://t.co/sxoE3pSfyu
"Bellinger couldn't make that play" doesn't mean it wasn't a good play. He didn't get an out -- but he did save a run. Huge. #WorldSeries
Seeing kids who are growing up in a instant result/140 character generation enjoy and appreciate baseball makes my heart happy. #WorldSeries
@joe_sheehan Me too, I meant to say that I really enjoy all your insights and that I respect your work .... but hey, what can we do? #1404Life
....... for the pitcher, not the hitter. But, yes. I agree with you. https://t.co/McTOFPYVUk
6th inning for a starter in the postseason is like the 9th inning. McCullers has defied the odds. #WorldSeries
Depending how up you’re referring to, depending on the type of hitter, depending on the pitcher &amp; movement/deception, hard to say “no one” https://t.co/CW1M4b3c0s
Dave Roberts keeping a straight face &amp; not losing his cool right there or showing Puig up tells you what kind of man he is. #WorldSeries
Absolutely not true, but specifically I mean belt to letters. https://t.co/7io6SbG8lD
McCullers that inning: https://t.co/iovIgHuNX3
McCullers: damage control. A run scores, but given how that inning started a double play is exactly what was needed. #WorldSeries
It’s not like McCullers is saying “no reason to focus” with a 4 run lead, but subconsciously it happens. Treat any lead like a tight one.
Sometimes, an early lead for a starting pitcher can cause them to let up. I tell my pitchers to treat a big lead &amp; a tie game the same way.
I’ve had the honor of meeting him &amp; watching his act. He’s a great person &amp; incredibly entertaining. Cancer sucks.  https://t.co/9X5NcsIIOh
97 flat &amp; up — crushed. 93 with movement — outs. Velo is nice, location is great. #WorldSeries
#Astros not chasing pitches out of zone — making Darvish fall behind then come into the zone. Recipe for disaster as a pitcher. #WorldSeries
The left-center power that Marwin Gonzalez displays is rather impressive. Can go with a pitch as well as anyone else. #WorldSeries
Bunt D, pep talk, etc. Not really pitching related as much as it is giving Darvish a breather, I would imagine. #WorldSeries https://t.co/wtT1gMymj6
Gurriel is the best hitter in the modern era of baseball to also sport the pineapple top hairstyle. #WorldSeries
Expect to see #Dodgers run on McCullers when they get the chance. A 47% breaking ball rate is a setup for stolen base attempts. #WorldSeries
Darvish didn’t panic that inning. Kept his cool, found his mechanics, regained his feel. It’s important to stay confident. #WorldSeries
Many athletes dream of D1 just to wear a uniform &amp; never play. If the mindset could be shifted to playing &amp; developing ANYWHERE, it's a win.
@CoachEngleLU Amen to that
@jbrady58 No, a few years later. However, I’ve heard nothing but amazing things about him.
A true professional doesn’t matter what their individual stats look like so long as the team wins. We &gt; Me
Nobody likes a “it’s not my fault, it’s yours” person. Take ownership, learn from the mistake, &amp; move on more wisely. No place for excuses.
To truly lead means you remember that while results are important, so are the individuals. The human factor cannot be forgotten.
Many professional players will tell you that the moment they started worrying more about the team than themselves, their own play improved.
Telling a player what they want to hear over what they need to hear simply to keep them/their parents happy is enabling &amp; helps no one.
This is every final out of the #WorldSeries since 1967 — and it’s pure awesomeness. https://t.co/iOOphPcPcd

The beauty of October baseball is that slates are wiped clean. Anyone can contribute &amp; confidence can be restored in a flash. #WorldSeries

We can preach &amp; preach all we want -- but it will never mean quite as much to people until they see us following through with our actions.
So much more is caught than taught. This should open our eyes to the idea that as coaches it's imperative that we practice what we preach.
@KDB_MLB Moral of the story: if you're small and they tell you that you can't, develop plus tools, rip through the minors, and tear up the bigs.
For those that have ever been told that you’re not big enough to play pro baseball, please watch Altuve &amp; remember that anything can happen.
There is an obvious level of talent that it takes to reach the pro ranks. However, pro athletes work hours on end to master their craft.
I've been in professional baseball since 2004, and there's been one constant: the ones who work hard tend to succeed. Those who don't? Gone.
No one can truly force you to work hard -- that's all on you. However, when the time comes, your work ethic &amp; character will shine through.

Congratulation to the @Dodgers on their trip to the #WorldSeries . I know this — few teams have a leader like Dave Roberts. #ThisTeam
@cculberson23 — congrats bud. Happy for y’all!
That's unreal -- on this stage -- in this game -- Kike'. Wow. #NLCS
. @ClaytonKersh22 is 99-1 with 4+ runs of support. He has 99 problems but a loss ain’t one. Well, it’s one. But only one. Okay I’m done.
The first step to being an effective leader is something you were taught early on: be honest. Honesty breeds trust. Trust breeds results.
I'm just happy that there will be baseball tomorrow, to be honest... #NLCS

The Evan Gattis story should remind EVERYONE that it's not too late to chase your dream ... to start again ... to start over. Inspirational.
@castrovince Davis won’t either.
Playing baseball is a unique blend of “I want to be a part of something“ and “hop on my back and let me carry you there.“
Most of the hours &amp; work you put in are not games or even practices. Training, learning, &amp; improving happen far away from the bright lights.
A fascinating look at research done on mound work versus flat grounds. @drivelinebases has blown my mind again. https://t.co/cKueCSIFCI
Don’t discount your worth because your path wasn’t as easy as other people’s. Remember, the toughest steel is forged from the hottest fire.
Your physical ability &amp; God given ability will take you there ... but your mental strength, work ethic, and character will keep you there.
A true team is a collection of individuals who decide to play &amp; fight for something bigger than themselves. It's an amazing thing to watch.
Every single one of us have gifts &amp; strengths that we were blessed with. Our job is to use them to better the world. Make today great!
What I know: that call tonight would’ve been 1,000,000 times better with Vin Scully behind the mic. Can’t second guess that. #NLCS #ThisTeam
“I don’t know about all that spin rate stuff ...” - @ClaytonKersh22   Sometimes, just pitch. There is such thing as paralysis by analysis.
Aspire to be better today than you were yesterday. Baby steps over time add up to giant strides. Don't discredit the small victories.
If you watch the path of the thrown baseball &amp; the short hop, Contreras was simply reacting &amp; setting up his feet to receive the throw. IMO
What you just saw from Contreras was pure athleticism and feel from a catcher to do exactly what he was supposed to do. #NLCS

Right. Too many signs pointed to leaving him out of this game and going with the pen that got you there. https://t.co/4s5VClAaCW
It's easy to point to a select few who have done it successfully .. but those guys can be counted on one hand. Utilize &amp; maximize strengths.
You made the postseason with guys in certain roles performing well. Switching everything up can really get guys out of whack.
Also, short rest makes what Scherzer did very tough. I believe there is something to be said for using who got you there in their roles.
It's such a tough thing to decide ... you want your best pitcher in the game, but relieving is such a different animal than starting. #NLDS
Obviously the big blow this inning was Michael Taylor ... but Wieters bunting to beat the shift was pivotal in a number of ways! #NLDS

@MattLaCasse @JeffPassan That’s a standard role for each pitcher. @JeffPassan is referring to when a reliever comes in the 3rd inning in a one run game. Not normal.

A coach solely looks at whether you won or lost. A leader looks at what you learned and helps you grow, regardless of a win or loss.
@JarridWilson @DaveRamsey @juliwilson FPU has been awesome for us too! Really glad we decided to go for it!
@darenw Usually my 87.7 MPH fastball came back to my left shin at 102.7 MPH........
@JeffPassan True, yet hard on the pitcher - especially in the postseason. Defined roles are important for preparation &amp; mentality. Understand it though.
Each day is a clean slate. We get a chance to learn from yesterday’s failures but we shouldn’t dwell on them. The time is now to move ahead.

I mean, nice catch @TheJudge44 ... but no offense, that’s like the world’s tallest man dunking a basketball.
@MikePinto3 Just happened in Boston game. Hinch put in a lhp to face Devers who’s hitting really well versus lhp. Homer.
@MikePinto3 Exactly. My point was just that if you know a LHH is hitting well vs a LHP, you may not want to use that strategy. Seems counterproductive.
So many are in favor of a left on left matchup simply because it’s left on left. Just read the stats. Numbers help when deciding what to do.
The left on left matchup only works when the lefty hitting against the lefty isn’t hitting .400 against lefties on the year. #ALDS
You won’t be told this often, but it’s incredibly true: you will learn more from losing than you ever will from winning.
Jansen just showed how in a single move you can mess up the timing of both the hitter and the runner. Both equally important. Nice job.
Errors happen. On the mound, keeping your cool &amp; focusing on the next pitch is of utmost importance. Don't show up your teammates. Ever.
Never ever think a baseball game is over, especially in the postseason. Wow. Love this game.
Ah, yes. The ole bat flip single. #NLDS
If anyone wants to know where I stand in my house, my son is now exclusively referring to me as Goofy.
That was an incredible feature about Dusty Baker with @CaseyStern. As a new manager I aspire to be so much of what Dusty is within the game.
We don’t know Girardi nor his thought process. Easy to second guess from our couch. The series isn’t over yet. Let’s see how it plays out.
I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing I COULD HAVE asked for help and possibly had it overturned as opposed to not even asking.
Heard @CJNitkowski talk about how Girardi took heat off the players and put it on himself. At the end of the day that’s what a leader does.
I understand not wanting to mess up the pitcher’s timing. I also understand why in a game of that magnitude you HAVE to ask for a replay.
As a coach, when a player asks for an eval, it's equally as important to deliver it correctly. Don't be condescending, be constructive.
@Buster_ESPN Umps don't want to get it wrong, especially with millions watching. What's been lost in replay is "Ask your partner if he had a better look"
So many of us would rather decide for ourselves what our shortcomings are, rather than asking others. Take the blinders off &amp; get better.
Don't be afraid to ask for &amp; hear the truth. It may be painful, it may be shocking, &amp; it may rub you the wrong way. But, it's always useful.
These playoff games have been taking HOURS long, and you know what? Baseball fans have been loving every single second. Pace of play? C’mon.

You’re too small, they say. Not enough size, they say. You can’t generate any power with that frame, they say. Never give up, Altuve says.
@logangauer34 Thanks Logan. Appreciate that.
You can go from coach to leader by teaching about life as well as sport. It’s a line that leaders cross. It’s not easy, but it’s necessary.
Don't let someone's opinion of you slow you down. Use criticism to grow and be fueled by the naysayers. It'll make all the difference.
It's hard to chase a dream without being motivated about something. Much of that comes with age. Don't count yourself out!

Postseason baseball so far... https://t.co/nPcf0KZPra
I miss the intentional walk four pitches. With a runner on 3rd in #PostSeason baseball, it makes the pitcher really concentrate.
Might as well take stats and throw them out of the window. This is October baseball, where anything can happen and anyone can step up.
It’s amazing what a team can accomplish when there is one vision, one goal, and one purpose. Coaches should strive to build that unity.
Who says we all can’t agree? We can all agree on this: baseball is the greatest game the world has ever known.

Pace of play? Every. Single. Fan. Loved. Every. Single. Minute.
@DomIzzoWDAY ......for the @FMRedHawks, not @mlb. Haha.
Trying to make the breaking ball nasty can cause the pitcher to “come around it” rather than “stay on top.” This causes lack of depth.
@bsimonnolibs Was referencing Severino &amp; Santana
Baseball. What an atmosphere. What a game. It’s the first inning of the #Postseason. We’re in for quite a ride.
A single elimination game creates nerves, no matter who you are. That’s why we’re seeing a lack of command from these pitchers.
@bsimonnolibs Yankees vs Twins
It’s tough when the secondary pitches aren’t sharp either because everyone in the ballpark knows the fastball has to come.
Velocity is important. Location is more important. Hitters at the professional level will hit mistakes, no matter the velocity.
This game is far from over. That’s the beauty of baseball. It takes all 27 outs. #WildCard
Wow. Dozier. That’s a statement. #WildCard

On the baseball field, errors will happen. Get used to it. Remember that you aren't defined by the error, but how you react to the error.

Aaaaaaaaaaaand, here comes #Postseason baseball. The best time of year.
"Why me?" A common question we ask in times of trouble. Usually that question is answered down the road when you're in the midst of success.
It's truly amazing what can happen on a team if, from the top to the bottom, everyone believes in themselves &amp; their teammates.
Coaches should strive to build a culture where players not only want the best for themselves, but also the best for their teammates.
If you polled former pro athletes &amp; ask them what they would change, I bet an overwhelming majority wishes they would've had more fun.
Baseball is a unique sport in that you don't have to be physically superior to win. Often it's finesse and mental strength that propels you.
If you play baseball and you call the season a grind, I recommend you find a new sport to play. It's not a grind if you love what you do.

Stepping onto the field &amp; doubting your abilities is like giving the other team a 3 run lead from the start. Have confidence in what you do.
The odds may be stacked against you, but true competitors find a way. Don't let excuses hinder you, let adversity fuel you.
So many people focus on the destination that they forget to enjoy the journey. Have long term goals but enjoy the short term experiences.
One thing I love about baseball is the life lessons it teaches. Among the best is that though you may lose, the important thing is to learn.

Lose 100+ games one year ago &amp; make the playoffs this year? Wow. What a remarkable turnaround by the @Twins! Why I love baseball so much!
Dabo’s words are powerful &amp; poignant. Wow. A true leader. https://t.co/HFUGNuTQkn
Discipline and character.   https://t.co/pPwjUud4HV
Remind me again why baseball isn’t the best? https://t.co/RyYea8Mlpk
A situation like this caused me to be a pitcher only. (Vid: @PitchingNinja) https://t.co/y36b7WQAGL
My thoughts on leadership. https://t.co/llbCIUOkqU
@CJNitkowski I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
This is why baseball is awesome.  https://t.co/aeq6FSnL1E
Absolutely without a doubt the best promotion in all of sports. @Braves @BeatThaFreeze https://t.co/AVTkH4PR0G
@JonAcuff What an accomplishment! Congrats man.
Thankful to be back with @643DPAthletics helping with the College Showcase Camp &amp; speaking to players about the next level &amp; their future.
You can prepare all you want physically &amp; work on mechanics every second of the day, but if you’re mentally weak none of that will matter.
This is in my hometown of Marietta, GA. It was used as a directional marker pre GPS. “Take a left at the Big Chicken &amp; it’s on the right.” https://t.co/XEZ0i3m0CX
We can't just show up &amp; be successful. The work, determination, &amp; dedication put in during the winter affects the success during the summer.
Yelling "stay closed" or "out front" are nothing but useless phrases that fill silence unless the pitcher understands their true meaning.
. @PaulByrd36, the Schlact family is praying for you &amp; your lower body. Can’t imagine what you’re about to endure. https://t.co/4KRyrUQsTb
There are stats that should definitely be posted &amp; analyzed. Then there are things that can’t be counted. Heart. Grit. Fight. Perseverance.
You won’t find heart listed on the back of a baseball card, but it’s just as important as any other stat on there. https://t.co/VnhCJQxeIk
The decision regarding personal instructors for your athlete is one of the most important decisions you’ll face.   https://t.co/B20q58bWcm
Position players everywhere are like 😐 (via @PitchingNinja) https://t.co/INrQbS1t3r
So many accept who we are right now as “the way it’s going to be.” The reality is that every day we have a pulse is a day we have a chance.
What you are right now is only important because it’s a stepping stone to who you’re becoming. Trust the process &amp; challenge yourself daily.
Criticism is either crippling or constructive. The turning point in the life of most athletes comes when a coach chooses one or the other.
Prayers for the young fan that got hit at @Yankees game. Time make extending the nets mandatory. @FMRedHawks did it this year, thankfully.
All eyes are now on the 2018 @AA_Baseball season. Looking forward to getting back out there &amp; battling again! Go @FMRedHawks!
Congratulations to the @Wpg_Goldeyes on winning the 2017 @AA_Baseball Championship. Also, congrats to the @Wingnuts_ICT for a great season.

@drivelinebases Gonna be huge!!
Becoming successful in life requires one to be proactive. Work ethic carries you a long way. Same thing on the field. Don't get lazy.
@SmartBIZWpg @GoldeyesGM @Wpg_Goldeyes and he NEVER sits down. @growcasting is one of the best around.
Our work ethic (or lack of) during the winter may not be noticed right away. However, the truth will come out, usually when it counts most.
You cannot succeed in baseball only focusing on the physical side of the sport. The mental side is just as (if not more) important.
@mikelinch @KDB_MLB @SES_Smitty3 @TJScout44 @rickymeinhold @DustinKEvans @Coach_Burke_30 @FCorral34 Really blessed to know these guys.
Former @FMRedHawks LHP @brandonmmann helped the @RockHounds to a 4th straight Texas League Championship! Wow!
Many can coach, few can lead. Leaders walk alongside people through tough times. Coaches simply tell you how to make it through tough times.
Coaches aren't looking for perfection. It's unattainable. Coaches look for those who care enough to stay positive &amp; learn from mistakes.
Setting a good example is not being perfect. It's a good attitude, perseverance, and the determination to try again when things go wrong.
A bad pitch, a bad AB, a bad game ... they all happen. Focus more on what caused them and how to improve on them. Wisdom through failures.
Rather than sitting around and dwelling on what we can't control, we must get proactive and work towards improving what we can control.
The easiest thing to do in life &amp; baseball is also the hardest to stop doing. Dwelling on the past &amp; mistakes is crippling to development.
Lists like this from our @FMRedHawks website show the impact that independent baseball has within @MLB orgs.   https://t.co/8WsVkMfgpI
Blessed to be a part of @AA_Baseball. Independent baseball is proving over &amp; over again that it helps start and restart @MLB careers.
Brandon Kintzler for the @Nationals is an @AA_Baseball alum. Work hard, stay focused, &amp; you never know what can happen. Keep chasing dreams.

Once, I ate 22 @ChickfilA nuggets in a row. So, yeah. Congrats to the @Indians.
Enjoyed my time on air with @JackTrackItDown today!   @FMRedHawks https://t.co/lE0uGDO2an
@billiejauss We say the same thing every year. "All of THIS fit in THAT car?!"
Was just talking with @JackTrackItDown. Which streak is most impressive?
To truly achieve success, everyone must be pulling on the same side of the rope. The same vision must be shared by each and every person.
Fastball arm speed is what makes this pitch. Any slowing of the arm &amp; it's not nearly as good. (Vid: @PitchingNinja) https://t.co/rCIhQ15Y2R
@Indians 22?!
Little League or the Big Leagues, what the @Indians are doing is remarkable. Winning a single professional baseball game is hard. 21?!

When you step on that mound, have confidence in your abilities &amp; conviction in your pitches. Believing you can is half the battle.
Coaching from T-Ball to professional ball doesn't change in that you still should respect &amp; care for those you're leading.
Players who believe that it takes an entire team to win are the players who ultimately will continue finding jobs in their sport.
Building a culture that involves positivity, encouragement, &amp; fun is just as essential as working on mechanics &amp; training.

So thankful for each and every @FMRedHawks fan. Your support of the team didn't go unnoticed. There are no better fans in all of baseball!
Mistakes happen. No one is perfect. What matters isn't what happened but how you respond to what happened.
A sincere thank you to each and every @FMRedHawks fan who came out to support us this season! It's coming down to the wire! #playoffpush
Baby steps lead to huge strides. Everyone starts somewhere, so be content but also be open. The path to success always involves adversity.
Baseball players are perfectly normal. I don't know what you're talking about.   https://t.co/dspYpn5dms
When adversity strikes, when the pressure is on, and when your back is up against the wall is when your true character shines through.
When things go right reflect on what's going well &amp; be thankful. When things go wrong reflect on what needs improvement &amp; be positive.
Couldn't be more proud of @lefty_TA on becoming the single season strikeout record holder in @AA_Baseball. You deserve it!   @FMRedHawks
@lefty_TA Proud of you!
In life &amp; baseball it's not so much what happens to you as it is how you react to what happens to you. Learn from &amp; don't dwell on mistakes.
I am so proud of each &amp; every one of the @FMRedHawks. They have grit &amp; guts. They stay calm &amp; confident. They never ever quit. Love it!
If you can make the most of small opportunities given to you, eventually you'll be given bigger &amp; bigger opportunities. Embrace your role.

Coaches should teach winning in amateur sports. There's also a place for teaching how to lose. But most important is teaching life lessons.
I've been watching the Little League regional games on espn &amp; I can't believe the poor sportsmanship &amp; body language. This. Has. To. Change.
This pitch is a strike for 57 feet. That's nasty.   GIF: @PitchingNinja https://t.co/GXwXpyyQbw
Everyone is different. Some "get it" early while others take more time. The important thing is to keep working hard &amp; to never give up.
@JonAcuff Comfort is real if we're comfortable in the right things. Being comfortable can be a sign that we're not growing. The sting could be growth!
Pitching with confidence and conviction is a must. There are lots of pitchers with MLB stuff but few with MLB attitudes. Work on it.
@hogansons @FMRedHawks Hoping for a super quick recovery. Let me know ANY TIME you need tickets &amp; you'll be all set.
A huge thanks to @FMRedHawks pitchers Pacillo, Dennis, &amp; Thompson for going to hang with Liam yesterday on his 7th bday. Get well soon, bud! https://t.co/Q7tI4Iiwft

⚾️👀 https://t.co/EcyCLOaC7g
Learn from a loss and you've won in the end.
15 wins in 16 games for the @FMRedHawks! Everyone chipping in &amp; embracing their roles. An exciting run &amp; really happy for all the guys.

It's not the error, mistake, or bad outing that defines you. It's how you react &amp; respond to those things that define you.
Excuses hinder our growth. Own up to mistakes and learn. Use the lesson to move ahead wiser. Success comes to those who learn from failure.

Part of the allure of baseball is that the catcher/pitcher relationship is unhindered by external sources. Either give signs or let them be. https://t.co/jcayNc6ZWk

@FCorral34 Heard the good news about @MizzouBaseball! Proud of you! They have themselves a great coach! Keep in touch!
When you step on that field with a negative attitude, you're already three steps behind your opponent. Stay positive &amp; remain confident.
The true beauty of baseball lies in the human error, the calculated pace of play, the pitching changes, and double-switches. Leave it alone.

Baseball is a sport for a short term memory. Whatever happened last inning, last game, or last season should be learned from not dwelled on.
Anything can happen at any time in baseball. Throw every pitch with purpose. Run every base with intent. Play every out with passion.

A good teammate will always communicate to his team what they saw the pitcher throw, what the movement was, &amp; where the arm slot was.
A sad reality is that many parents want their kids to succeed in sports so badly that they end up pushing them so hard they quit altogether.
No problem bud. Happy to. https://t.co/GEbrXqMluk
Coaches are less concerned with the fact that you made an error &amp; more concerned with how quickly you learn &amp; bounce back from it.
This is the definition of a leader. Anyone can coach, few can lead.  https://t.co/9wGhKpdcyx
Our true character is exposed when adversity strikes. People rarely remember how you played, but they'll definitely remember how you acted.
As baseball players, having a short term memory is critical. Learn from yesterday but don't dwell in it. A loss isn't a loss if you learned.

The best way to silence the critics on the baseball field is to let your play do the talking.
It's ok to be out-played. It's not ok to be out-worked. Losing is part of a game, but make sure you didn't lose due to lack of preparation.

Those in the field playing behind the pitcher don't want someone who is a human rain delay. Pitch with intent, focus, &amp; good rhythm.
A pitcher should step on that mound and recognize that they're in control of the game. They set the tempo &amp; tone from the first pitch.
When in Texas... https://t.co/PDEc27F83M
Good morning, DFW! Glad to be back in Texas. Off day, then we start a 4 game series vs the @TXAirhogs. Ready for the @FMRedHawks season!
Excuses expose immaturity. Those who own up to mistakes not only learn to self-evaluate but also gain wisdom from overcoming obstacles.
The odds may be stacked against you, but those are the moments when you can choose to give up or reach down and see what you're made of.
My mom sacrificed so much of her own free time to be at the ball field with me. I'm forever thankful for her &amp; her love. #happymothersday
Happy Mother's Day @jillian_schlact! Our sweet boy is so lucky to have such a selfless, patient, kind, &amp; loving mama. Thanks for all you do!
Moments fly by as we try to get things done &amp; fit more in. The best moments are the little ones that we might miss if we aren't careful. https://t.co/aE4lsseNX8
Leaders don't always have to be vocal. Often, leading by example says more than any words you could ever speak.
Yesterday, for an hour, I hit ground balls to professional infielders so they could work solely on footwork. Don't. Forget. Fundamentals.
People think that pro ballplayers are too good to work on fundamentals. Wrong. The best practice them daily &amp; never forget the foundations.
It's hard to make it &amp; even harder to stay. That's why preparation is important, but work ethic &amp; character are too. Work on it.
If you make a mistake, take a step back and learn something from it. When you do, you'll move forward again with more confidence &amp; wisdom.
Happiness will come and go, but joy endures. The moment you find joy in what you're doing is the moment you become unshakeable.
Pitching is a unique blend of power and finesse. There's no room for "throwers" because it's the "pitchers" that excel day in and day out.
There may be room for improvement in certain areas. Recognizing what you need to work on is different than ditching who you are completely.
Players get into trouble when they look around &amp; see others that do something differently or better. Don't strive to conform. Just do you.
A team is made up of several individuals who come together, work together, &amp; fight together to achieve a common goal. Buy in to the process.
Recognize the skills you bring to the team &amp; embrace those. Don't try to be like everyone else, because then you lose what makes you unique.
Nice day in Winnipeg. @FMRedHawks vs @Wpg_Goldeyes in an exhibition game tonight. https://t.co/d14bzDgebf
Pitchers:  •Attack the zone.  •3 pitches or less.  •Pitch inside.  •Any pitch in any count.  •Trust your stuff.
Please say a quick prayer for my 93 year old grandmother who is having surgery this morning related to removing some cancer. Thanks so much.
Horace was in a few of my classes. Great guy &amp; a blessing to have in class. https://t.co/UUiBPCSyVR
I'm amazed at what I see every single day. The truth is &amp; continues to be that heart, grit, &amp; character can beat out talent. Keep working.
My son turns 2 yrs old today. Wow, time flies. It's been the most fun two years of my life. So blessed to be his dad. Happy birthday, buddy!

Set goals &amp; have dreams to reach destinations. However, don't get caught up so much on the results that you forget to enjoy the journey.
No one knows when the last day putting on that uniform is. Cherish each day &amp; give thanks for each time you can suit up with your teammates.
This is awesome. https://t.co/DtRi63W6UK
We refuse to talk about our struggles &amp; shortcomings, forgetting that oftentimes that's what helps people through their issues the most!
It's good to be back with the @FMRedHawks again - blessed &amp; thankful for another opportunity to put that uniform on. Love this game. https://t.co/fl3YbWPU5i
@JonAcuff Even then, just use a fire extinguisher and let them go to their destination for goodness sakes.
Our past does not define who we are, but it does define who we are to become. Don't dwell on where you've been-learn from where you've been.
There has to be a "why" behind everything you do on the field. If it doesn't have a purpose, you can't expect progress.
A slider is commonly known as a "fastball with a finish." This is a video game slider, btw. (GIF: @PitchingNinja) https://t.co/NZG9lq7PEO

Success within an organization or team begins at the top with servant leadership &amp; trickles down to the very last person doing their part.
Is there anyone better than Vin Scully? The answer is no, by the way. @Dodgers

To be the best, you have to train the best. Very rarely is success just handed to anyone. It usually is found by the one who works for it.
I dare you to find a more inspiring ball player than this one. https://t.co/VpJTN99eWo
People can find faults &amp; shortcomings in things you can't control, like size. However, don't let them find faults in your heart &amp; character.

When something goes wrong in a game, we immediately assume it's mechanical. Don't neglect the mental side. It's often a mindset or approach.
Grit, heart, &amp; hustle are three traits that don't have stats, but may influence the outcome of a game more than anything else. Work on them.
Guaranteed the best thing you'll see on Twitter this week. https://t.co/jqh8ZyFgBW
If you step in the box, on the mound, or even on the field with a negative attitude, your opponent already has an edge. Think like a winner.
Wow. This is groundbreaking. https://t.co/R9bDXQDAIm
True leaders aren't always vocal. Often, they show their leadership through actions. Leading by example says more than words ever will.
Infielders complain about bad hops as they sit back and let the hops get bad. Get off your heels and come get the baseball.
Some mornings, you just need Lightning McQueen, Tow Mater, and some O's to feel better. https://t.co/muCQLxMOLb
Regardless of what your private lesson instructor tells you, it's possible to worry TOO much about mechanics. Paralysis by analysis is real.
Fear is a lie that tries its best to hold you back &amp; hold you down. Break free &amp; move ahead in confidence &amp; faith.
Facing Cueto is like facing 4 different pitchers all in one at bat. Love his ways of messing up the hitter's timing.
I know nothing about anything that Home Depot sells. To counter, I carry a piece of wood around a few aisles to look the part.
Too often baseball players take a small sample size of failure &amp; make big adjustments. It may not even be physical. Check focus &amp; mentality.
What you do is NOT who you are. Your job title is NOT your identity. https://t.co/XhIKYXUrj1
Tough day at #ESPN. Days like this are common in the baseball world too. Heading off into the unknown is sadly common. Best to all of them.
My son's infatuation with the movie Cars has me wanting to go from Chicago to LA on #Route66. Anyone done that trip?

Fastball, fastball, slider mindset is a must. If you slow arm speed/aim, this isn't possible. GIF @PitchingNinja https://t.co/8YzO8jd4IE
Far too often, fear holds us back. Far too often, we forget faith drowns out fear, and that being prepared can eliminate the need to fear.
So often we try so hard to be who we're not that we completely forget who we are. Embrace your strengths &amp; make the most of your talents.
Pitchers: Stop looking in the dugout 32 times an inning. You're battling, not the coach. Step up, make pitches, and trust your abilities.
A beautiful thing about a new day is that there's a clean slate. Sure, you can't change the past. However, you can learn from it &amp; move on.
I'm embarrassed for this umpire. This is a joke. https://t.co/G7gyni1oZi
It's far more important to worry about what you can control than to worry about what you can't. Work hard &amp; trust the process every day.
Beware of coaches that want to put their "stamp" on you. Typically, it's all about them, not you. Know your body, do research, &amp; be careful.
Keys to a delivery that you should be focused on are timing &amp; repeatability.
There are some fundamental principles of a delivery/mechanics that must be in place. However, there must be some originality/deception.
For every "perfect mechanic" pitcher, may I introduce you to ten that don't do it by the book? What you call weird, they call effective.
@PitchingNinja The ole left handed curveball from a righty.
@MLBGIFs Um, Sonny &amp; Cher. Duh.

@UncleCharlie50 ... raking.
This is phenomenal. Puts baseball into perspective. https://t.co/9hbyP59uaC
@JarridWilson That's a really powerful way to think about the topic.
If we spent as much time working as we did worrying, the future wouldn't seem so daunting. Trust the process &amp; stay focused on your goals.
It's easy to point your finger towards someone else when things don't go right, but the true sign of a leader is owning failure &amp; fixing it.
Wow. @SunTrustPark is beautiful. @Braves https://t.co/bv96LdtMHA
When parents bail their kids out of situations that cause failure, they harm long term growth opportunities. At times, losing is learning.
Owning failure in sports creates a lifelong habit of learning from mistakes. There is no growth opportunity with excuses.
Pitching inside means pitching fearlessly. It means taking ownership of the plate. It means showing the batter you're in control. It works.
This is the best thing you'll see all day. I love baseball. https://t.co/bUzdSj3cIf
A motion, a moment, a plan, &amp; dreams are all meaningless if there's no why behind it. Purpose &amp; vision drive success.
Well, the wait is over. @FMRedHawks fans will know where to find me every single day but Sunday! https://t.co/016hda4r5Q
Athletes want to complain about their circumstances, forgetting that most of the time circumstances aren't the problem. The attitude is.

@lvanpam @PaulByrd36 The only reason I lasted as long as I did was because of you. I'll partially blame you for this mess.
@KevinMcAlpin That was literally the worst foul ball call I have ever seen.  Ever. Haha. Wash is the best.
@PaulByrd36 I feel like I can do the same stuff I could do 10 years ago. Just pay for it the next day.
@PaulByrd36 It always feels that way, man. It's God's way of keeping your confidence up yet humbling you all at the same time.
A seemingly pointless two out single with nobody on can spark a rally. Never lose hope &amp; keep fighting til the very end.
@PaulByrd36 74?! At least you're only down a few mph from your glory days. I'm lucky to sniff 64 now. #labrum #rotator
You know, to speed up the game. https://t.co/9Hat6oIURe
Far too often, coaches are putting the roof on the house before they build the foundation. Teach. The. Fundamentals. First.
I watch coaches spend hours at practice working on trick plays &amp; specialty skills for players. When it's game time, they can't catch a ball.
It's important to remember that games aren't really won or lost in the run column. Free bases, errors, &amp; wasted AB's are quick ways to an L.
Heroes in baseball don't always hit a walk-off homer. Often, they run out a grounder &amp; are safe or they move a runner into scoring position.
At the end of the season see how many 1 run games you won or lost. It makes or breaks the season. Do not take the little things for granted.
Lofty dreams are great, but a dream without a plan is just a wish. Take the small steps now that will add up to huge strides later on.
This is definitely what my face looked like when I gave up moon shots too. Hey, might as well enjoy the show! https://t.co/VdtVxaD5b7

How you act &amp; how hard you work when the bright lights of the field aren't on &amp; nobody is watching truly determines your character &amp; heart.
New sign for pick to first... https://t.co/5bsp6ewzwj
I've seen great athletes never reach their true potential &amp; it had NOTHING to do with talent. Poor work ethic &amp; character held them back.
We may be down, but we're not out. Hold on. Hang tight. Have faith. Jesus was in the tomb before God raised Him back up again.
My friend @brandoncoker wrote a beautiful song that fully encompasses what Easter is all about. Hope you'll listen!  https://t.co/mxbqYUYUaa
Who you are and whose you are never change. What you do can change in an instant. Make sure your attention &amp; focus are on the right things.
As a pitcher, when you take ownership of the plate everything changes. Pitching inside and moving the hitter's feet are crucial for success.
Happy Easter! https://t.co/oCp8OeUUDk
@RonPopeMusic It's not. #FakeNews
@JarridWilson Steel geeeeeeeetar
Good Friday-Easter Sunday is a reminder to us that we may be down, but we're never out. Trust God in the darkness &amp; praise Him in the light.
No one could believe it. Jesus was gone. Hope was lost. But, God wasn't done yet. Sunday was coming. God was planning the ultimate comeback.
Scouts &amp; college coaches watch a LOT more than just what skills you possess on the field. They're watching body language, work ethic, etc.
Man, if I could sit around a table with those folks and talk baseball.... https://t.co/E5dYmiwkYd
A hero in baseball doesn't always mean getting a walkoff hit or pitching well. It can be a sac bunt in the 3rd or getting an out in the 8th.
@Wheeler_High @bashbrooks2 @GMajor9 @_WHSPrincipal @soonervol1 @WheelerHigh_BB @ScotFishHaddock @wheelerco2017 @Wheeler_Cats Congrats guys! Keep it up!
@PaulByrd36 @manhoodjourney Love it.
@robgreene @Braves Shhhh, the commissioner might see this and realize he needs to change something else if he thinks people don't know baseball well enough.

Don't ever stop chasing your dreams. At the end of it all you will NEVER regret going for it. Often, it's the journey that's most rewarding.
Baseball isn't boring, you're boring. https://t.co/D4GvAVWxI7
Critics &amp; naysayers will always be around. They're not worth your time. Stay the course, work hard, and let the results silence them.
Baseball is unique in that to be successful you don't have to be the biggest, strongest, or fastest. Embrace your skills &amp; master them.
One of the hardest things in life is to go against the grain. Not many are extraordinary because not many want to do extra. Swim upstream.
The path to success is uphill, rocky, &amp; often slippery. Not many people make it up because not many people are willing to sacrifice &amp; work.
Often, it's not the error that defines us on the field, it's the reaction to the error. Don't let it affect the next play. Learn &amp; move on.
Baseball IS NOT OVER until the last out is made. Never stop fighting. Never quit trying. Never lose hope. You never know what could happen.
One of the toughest things a young athlete deals with is the unmet dreams of their parents which become unrealistic expectations on them.
A fantastic read. Thanks @MaTaylor24 for sharing your heart &amp; journey in baseball. Give this a read! https://t.co/IwQJSEXcUv
So much can be accomplished when we change our mindset from "I hope" to "I will."
You know, just in case you needed to understand why Georgia is one of the top 10 most stressed out states.  https://t.co/1gzfejtF4L
Coaches, if they don't believe you love them, they'll never let you lead them. Relationships before results.
It's my belief that if you think you know it all your impact on others &amp; your growth will both be limited. Drop the ego &amp; pick up knowledge.
I am consistently and constantly blown away at how much you can learn about baseball daily, regardless of level. You will never know it all.

During the winter, workouts &amp; conditioning seem boring &amp; useless. Those who bought in then are thankful now. It also works the other way.
Youth coaches often think they're teaching athletes about the game, forgetting that most won't go pro. They're really teaching LIFE lessons.
A downfall to private lessons is they're so mechanically based &amp; geared towards a quick fix when all that's needed may be a mindset change.
Our scars are proof that we were wounded and now we're healed. Our failures act in the same manner. Learn from them &amp; move ahead wisely.

Anyone can have the title of coach, but few earn the title of leader. Step on that field for a purpose bigger than yourself.
At some point, your dreams need to take flight &amp; action needs to begin. If you never start working for it, you'll never actually reach it.

Just as each &amp; every action on the baseball field should have a purpose &amp; be intentional, so should your thoughts. Focus &amp; lock in mentally.
Today, rise up in confidence &amp; faith. Forget the shortcomings of yesterday &amp; move ahead with joy, peace, &amp; trust.
You aren't going to be handed success. Often, the "overnight success" is years in the making. Be prepared to work hard &amp; overcome adversity.
If you wouldn't build a house without first pouring the foundation, then don't coach baseball without first teaching the fundamentals.
@robfee hint: usually the secret involves a new recipe that he tried for dinner &amp; also the new, hip restaurant to try in town.
Excuses are roadblocks to success. Owning your mistakes &amp; learning from them is the fuel you need to power through adversity.
It's surreal how quickly life happens. I remember being terrified of thunderstorms as a kid &amp; now I'm comforting my own son through them.

A true leader doesn't always have to be vocal. Leading by example is often just a crucial is leading with words.
That'll electrify the office.  https://t.co/OuJItehf8r
Learning to react positively to negative situations is a reason why athletes continue to go to the next level. Talent only goes so far.
Athletes that have small roles during games often complain, forgetting that TEAM is above SELF. What can you do to contribute? Buy in.
Doing the little things helps to win big games. Covering first, a sac bunt, or hitting the cutoff man may seem insignificant, but it's HUGE!
Repeatable mechanics = repeatable results. Strive to learn how your body works &amp; make the most of it.
The best players never seem to panic. They have a sense of courage, confidence, &amp; competitiveness that keeps them up even when they're down.
I'll be on @740TheFAN with @JackTrackItDown in about 10 minutes talking @FMRedHawks &amp; who knows what else! Listen: https://t.co/SwewhGcqaX
Players don't take their time in the bullpen or the on-deck circle seriously &amp; then wonder why they didn't succeed. Preparation is key.
There is a very fine line between helping &amp; enabling. Let your child learn from adversity &amp; failure. It'll help them become wiser adults.
On the baseball field, errors, Ks, &amp; bad pitches happen. It's not that they happen, it's how quickly you bounce back that matters most.
We can go through life chasing a dream, working toward goals, &amp; searching for purpose while completely forgetting to have some fun. Enjoy.
I'm just going to say it. I love baseball. Everything about it. Gives me chills. Makes me happy. Fires me up.
Winning isn't always a product of talent. Those who think, work, &amp; hustle can beat the more talented team a lot of the time.
Chuck Norris wears Madison Bumgarner pajamas. #mlb
As an athlete, when you finally step on a field with a "I know I can" attitude instead of a "I hope I can" attitude, everything will change.
Ordinary athletes will find excuses for why things didn't work out. Champions lose the excuse &amp; work to make sure it doesn't happen again.
It's going to be a great day, @MLB is back!
A grind implies something you HAVE to do &amp; must force your way through. If you call baseball a grind, don't play. You should love it.
@MikeSkogen Put that way, radar gun. Just think it's sad regardless.
@RealCJ10 Thank you for playing the game for the game. Baseball is a lifestyle, a passion, &amp; a love. Chasing $ may leave you rich but poor.
Parents with radar guns at 12u games will be the end of me. Let. The. Kids. Play.

Far too often, we quit when things get tough. Don't forget that the toughest steel is forged from the hottest fire. Push through.
Pitchers:  •Learn to pitch inside effectively &amp; with intent. Lose the fear of hitting the batter. It's part of the game. The plate is yours.
Having your parents bail you out of every mess &amp; every less than ideal situation may help you now, but it'll really hurt in the long run.
Society/culture has been trying to make us buy this lie that success looks a certain way. It's not the same for everyone. Do what you love.
I was amazed each time I moved up the ladder in baseball. It wasn't always the talent that jumped each time, it was consistency &amp; approach.
When I talk to college coaches or pro scouts about a prospect, they talk some about their talent &amp; A LOT about their character.
Many realize too late that it was something they could control that held them back &amp; all along they were worried about what they couldn't.
The more you look around and notice what other people have, you'll begin to forget what you have. Embrace your skill set &amp; talents.
It's not an error, a bad pitch, or a strikeout that defines you. It's whether or not you learn from it &amp; fix it moving forward that does.
Losing a game because you simply got out-performed is ok. Losing a game because you simply got out-worked is not. Always. Be. Prepared.
You won't like every coach you have just like you won't like every boss you have. Learn how to deal with that now &amp; save a headache later.
