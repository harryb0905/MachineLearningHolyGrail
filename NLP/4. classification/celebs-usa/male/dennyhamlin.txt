The preferred line is the one with the most cars in it. You don’t run faster up against the wall. 10 cars in a line up top running say 46.50s, those same cars would run 46.00s if they all committed to running bottom. In the end it seems guys are just happy with a good finish. 🙃
Practice is complete for our team this weekend. My @FedEx @ToyotaRacing  team has me a FAST car for this year’s #DAYTONA500 . Let’s get it! https://t.co/HsJiiKfHnt

Out of respect for the Gibbs Family, we have postponed today's unveil. We will share the new scheme soon. Thank you for understanding.
My favorite picture. Me and JD together before my first race in 2006. My dad in the background looking on. He said to JD, “He’s all yours now” I’ll never forget it https://t.co/w6Ldj7FAIf
His car. His number. His signature above my door. I will always be grateful for what His family did for mine and the opportunity he gave me 14 years ago. Now more than ever #doitforJD
Mark your calendars for next Monday. Here's a sneak peek of what's to come. 1/14 at 11 AM ET on https://t.co/TzwPN6cNc2.   @FedEx https://t.co/ozbQIi6kHJ
@TheMikeBagley @iRacing You pinch you pay... car low, you’re in the clear Bag Man
@jacksongolf @JoeGibbsRacing @FedEx @MW55 @TheGolfGuysTour If it weren’t for handicaps I might never lose😁 seems like I’m always getting beat by the USGA
@JoeGibbsRacing @FedEx I’m much happier then the appearance of this photo. That or I just watched Tay do something she shouldn’t have.
@MardyFish Done did..
Too soon? https://t.co/GSXmkt0KwT
@SECNetwork His voice alone is terrifying. Can’t believe he had to say it twice 🤭
I mean you gotta let the crowd know you got the first down on a 4 yard run. Nevermind the clock. 🤨 Cam is Cam.
@A_S12 @bubbawatson @chaseelliott @BubbaWallace @ErikBrown14 @sbjsbd Can’t wait to see what comes of this merger. @FuelSMG has done such a great job representing me my entire career. This is going to be a game changer as far as resources go. Glad to be a part of it.
Oh man.. can’t tell you how bad I did NOT want to get in that car. @Aric_Almirola deserved that opportunity. https://t.co/DqHGxMLceb
Fair assessment here. A lot of close calls to keep streak alive but not doing it just fires me up more. I’m ready for 19 https://t.co/YiWblGH9KK
@NickBromberg I wasn’t speaking about you btw. I love stats. I’m speaking more to general twitter tough guys.
@DGodfatherMoody @NickBromberg I’ve only had a couple outside and I’m the worst driver on the planet if I believed what I saw on social. Some people just need to be happier with themselves before commenting on someone else
@Allbrick55 @NASCAR 31 wins bum
@NASCAR Or every full season of my career but hey 🤷🏼‍♂️
Thanks @diamondresorts for the invitation. Looks like I got some work to do in the next month. See y’all there! @FSOrlando @LPGA @GolfChannel https://t.co/f7rVFmfIK9
Oh how people forget. Congrats on everything you’ve accomplished so far. #notdone https://t.co/TCXurYRJUB
@A_S12 @sbjsbd @MarcusSMI Would the track itself have to go into a “approval” process? Does IMSA have this? Can’t imagine they would be cool with running over turtles and running wide open into a 90* wall. Then again who doesn’t love carnage 🤷🏼‍♂️
@markmartin I agree as well. They are exact same since I raced them 16 years ago
@bobpockrass Ughh. Someone who is the absolute best at their job losses it because of lack of “clicks”. Just wrong that this is the world we live in.
This #LSUvsTAM game has a chance to beat the number by 100.. yes 100
Chunk from 87 out? Wow. Pros, they are just like us #TheMatch
It turns out these guys circle of friendship is slightly larger then me and my friends  #TheMatch
@Brett_Moffitt Thanks for the 💰
They better onside kick..
@CocaColaRacing @CocaCola @HomesteadMiami @JoeGibbsRacing Thanks for the cake @CocaColaRacing !
@JamieLittleTV @kaseykahne Agree.  @kaseykahne = wheelman
I’d like to say thank you to @jamiemcmurray @AJDinger and @mattkenseth for everything y’all did for our sport over the years. It was a pleasure to share the track with great talents like yourselves. Good luck to whatever the future holds for you guys. 🏁
Congrats @Brett_Moffitt on a spectacular season. Engine smingine. Ass kickin. @ToyotaRacing 🏁🏆
5 wins, 37 top 5s, 61 top 10s. Thank you @MikeCWheeler for the last couple of years. You were there for me in the beginning when I first started with JGR 14 years ago. It’s been a great ride. https://t.co/FLQOIiDbiu

It’s a #TRDtakeover – the new #Camry and #Avalon #TRD look amazing &amp; the drive is incredible. Thanks @ToyotaRacing https://t.co/lLBy9WhXOQ
Apparently while racing for the lead with 30 to go I thought hmm how can I end his chances, oh yea. Get hooked in the RR down the straight and send Kurt down the track. That’ll get him
@DGodfatherMoody @chaseelliott Man you should see some of this stuff. I wonder if they even realize that me and Chase are good? Have been for 10 months now.
Dear @chaseelliott . You sure have some passionate fans. Delusional, but passionate none the less. Love is blind

@BradGillie @MattWeaverAW Boy, you my friend are reaching
@sma0024 Ahh so it just matters if he’s your favorite... makes sense. 🙄 enjoy the rest of your trolling night.
@sma0024 Did you troll him when he accidentally took out martin at the Roval?
@sma0024 @MikeBarbone191 @SiriusXMNASCAR And 7 time champ Jimmie Johnson
@MikeBarbone191 @sma0024 @SiriusXMNASCAR He has no one else to talk to. Figured I would engage him to make him feel better

Me and Kurt spoke at the plane and shared a beer afterwards. Got nothing but respect for him and his guys. We will head to homestead and try to finish off strong.
Hate it for my race team and those involved today while we were racing for the lead. I heard the 20 and 41 were up the track so I tried to clear before I got to the exit. Unfortunately @KurtBusch was still there and I got loose under him.
@dustinlong Thank you
@dustinlong @KurtBusch Clear up this quote Dustin. I said he wasn’t at fault for the wreck
@BubbaWallace My eyes were closed
@BubbaWallace Held a nice wheel all day
@MattWeaverAW You can’t even hardly find a car on the road today that has 15” wheels on it. We need something with a durable and tough sidewall to allow GY to put a compound tread that lays rubber. That is what forces us to move off the bottom. Until then we will continue to chase a “package”
@MattWeaverAW It’s naïve to think the 19 package will fix the one lane racing we saw today. It is a tire/track problem. Tire just flat out do not lay rubber anymore. I’m hoping that when a completely new car is designed we design it around a tire/wheel combination that is correct.
@bobpockrass I’m genuinely worried he’s gonna hurt himself. Hitting a wall at 77 is not the same when your in 20s/30s/40s.
Damnit

@becca_j2018 Hey I hate to bring up FACTS but neither are racing for points. And only 2 drivers on the track were behind them. If you have a tight budget team you need to get to the finish line in 1 piece in order to get better.
This one hurt. Hurt bad. Can’t thank my whole team on the road and shop for making this car so fast. Team, pitcrew, CC all were perfect today. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come. Let’s make a run...
@CalebStrong07 Thinking of you Caleb

@bobpockrass My Sponsor did this for me. Kept it from me until a couple days before reveal. I didn’t choose our throwback but I’m super grateful that they would do this for me and my parents.
Here it is. This year our throwback is about my short track racing roots and my family’s sacrifices to get me to this point. Can’t thank @FedEx enough for doing this. https://t.co/CXmS8CFTAD

Joe, the age-less one. Thanks for signing my hat boss! https://t.co/FWVgDgZrHH
My sponsor continues to be the best. Above is a pic of when I got to meet Joe for the first time. Got him to sign my 1992 Super Bowl hat. 2 week later I lost that hat on the school bus. At skins training camp @FedEx presented me with a replacement. Now just need Joe to sign it :) https://t.co/x1Xa6z0vrZ

Happy for @chaseelliott and team. Well deserved and earned win.
Man that was a bummer of a race. Had a great car and things just botched up on the last stop. Ripped out our brake cooling and things just went downhill from there. Glad most of the guys are ok. Watching video that one was scary.
Race ready thanks to @CocaColaRacing. #partner https://t.co/Kty8nNIEKQ
@jeff_gluck No exaggeration on this one. 3 witnesses including @KyleLarsonRacin and @MW55.
@jeff_gluck You bet.. 💪🏻
@Maluhaka @jeff_gluck Fairway runs out at 300. I was in rough. Water in front of hole
@jeff_gluck 480 par 5. 140 left. Pitching wedge.
Well today was a first.. a albatross (a 2 on a par 5) on the last hole. https://t.co/djFisQv9Aq
@CopaCavanna 25 legit winning cars out there. Deep field
Hate losing a top 5 due to luck of draw restarts. Bottom lane was awful. Still made gains this weekend in the right direction. On to the Glen.
@2Spotter A fake profile, a negative tweet with profanity. And you just showed it to 20k of your followers... Jooooeeeeyyy. 😏😡
@bobpockrass Go home Bob.
@jeff_gluck @JRaymond87 I stand corrected. Changes everything
@jeff_gluck Not really. Race has been all green but no tires for anyone put on. This is where less is less, not more.
All green. P2

A lot of ppl asking what time on dash and orange stripe on mirror are for from helmet cam last night. Time helps me manage time left in practice and qualifying. Orange stripe allows me to clear myself when spotter is at a bad angle. If car is below line I’m not clear. https://t.co/oDGUfdZP1f
@bobpockrass @ewbailey17 @JoeGibbsRacing Time of day on dash is mostly used for keeping track of how much time is left in practice so I can manage how many laps i make per run.
@KyleBusch Bro... Stop responding to these people. They are sending these tweets cuz they know you will respond.
Congrats to @TyGibbs_ on winning this weekend at Caraway. Greg and the boys musta had it tuned up for ya!

@NASCARonReddit Pretty crazy last lap..
Much better car than where we qualified. I look forward to the challenge tomorrow.

@jeff_gluck @zachstur @KyleLarsonRacin @MW55 We had a rule. Leader must run the top. Worked out well as I positioned myself 2nd going into final lap. @MW55 however missed his line and used mine instead. Fun race
@JennaFryer @KyleLarsonRacin I as a matter of fact was the one who stopped, went back to garage, exchanged gas from one can to another. Team effort. Now go to bed
Me and @KyleLarsonRacin just earned some good juju for tomorrow’s race.. https://t.co/dFClWI3DVm
@SpotterBrett I said “they”
@pkligerman Correct. Would have to be even slower if they want it to work like they want
Disappointed in this @KingJames presser. How come no one will ask what’s in the man purse?
They said @JHarden13 dribbled 600 times one game in the WCF.. anyone got a count on @KingJames? Looks a lot alike.

@eddiegossage Sorry bro. Gotta be more original then that. I’m just there for fuzzy’s tacos truth be told.
Go Nova!? Or go Blue!?Even aside from the crazy shooting last game I still believe Nova is the much more talented team. They win 75-66.
@NASCARonNBC You just can’t beat a PB&amp;J for a rain delay snack. Most bang for the buck no doubt.

Opening day of the @TheGolfGuysTour. It’s like Christmas morning. Wanna thank @OlliesOutlet for coming on as our title sponsor! Follow along the GGT twitter page for live updates all day.
Although traffic is a pain right now it’s pretty awesome to see cranes all over Charlotte. New building and roads going up all over. Future looks bright
P25. Not the qualifying run we were looking for. Just not enough speed in the car to make it to the next round. Looking forward to the start of the race on Sunday 😌
@k1speed @RodneyChilders4 I don’t trust any “track records” temp, kart, and track manipulation too big a factor :). Plus I need to be in the heavy division 😂
@RodneyChilders4 @k1speed I’ll challenge your time..

Very good driver here that deserves being on the track. Any company would be represented well on his car. https://t.co/cyQCui9Apv
Took a top 5 car and managed to finish 17th with it. Sped on pit road and that pretty much ruined our day. Oh and broke a valve spring with 20 to go.. when it rains it pours. Can’t wait to get the PHX.
@brittanymarsh61 Ahh, makes a little more sense now
@brittanymarsh61 Can’t be the NEW winner of EACH race can he?
@meyer7713 Seem like nice guy to me.. why not.
@meyer7713 Fantastic
@grainger655 Agree. But I won’t be on that recliner for some time..

@jaxdan43 Read my message moron
Anyone who wouldn’t take offense to the stupid things that was said has absolutely no backbone. I have one
Then, I go do media and everything is fine. Then the last question is what was my response to what Bubba said. I had no issue until not only did he place blame on me but then went on to make personal comments about myself. I left the media center and saw Bubba 30 secs later.
Let me clue the idiots on Twitter what I was pissed off about. I had no issue with how the race ended. I was minding my own business on the bottom of the track and out of the blue  I get ran into, my tire blown, and perfectly straight car destroyed. I’m good with all that.
@MW55 @FedEx @austindillon3 @Hooters I gave it my best shot. And you should know, that’s a hard shot! 👊🏻
What a comeback for our @FedEx team. We gave ourselves a shot to win on the final restart and lost the coin flip. Really happy for @austindillon3 and team. And for anyone looking for a reason to hate, the 43 came down on ME and cut my tire at the line which is why we wrecked.
17 years ago we lost the greatest driver ever to race @DISupdates. Hoping today we make him proud by putting on the greatest show in motorsports. The #DAYTONA500
My favorite commercial to date. The story of this family follows along with how I started in racing when I was 5. Went to a race and it became my passion. Thank you @ToyotaRacing https://t.co/14ajhPR64b
Without a doubt. Jordan and the greats were head and shoulders above the next best guys. Today that gap between Bron/Kd and and field is MUCH closer https://t.co/7B60RV168P

Tomorrow’s non-playoff winner might be the most irrelevant winner in the history of sports. 3 big names “retiring” and a championship winner all in one night. Just drive er into VL,pickup the trophy and go home.  Hope it’s us.
@jonmason11 @MrTeeOhSee Back at ya bud. Hope all is well
Heck yea! My teams been killing it the last month in Qualifying. Can’t wait to race on Sunday. Gonna work on making it a race winner tomorrow.
@jeff_gluck Ha! I didn’t name names.. has more to do with the headline question
You don’t need to click it goes like this. 24 takes race from 2, No fault. 11 spins 24, DH fault. 24 wrecks 11, DH fault again. Stupid media. https://t.co/P3iT6vVTrq
I wanna say thanks to my team today. Every person who works on the 11 car and @JoeGibbsRacing did a amazing job giving me the best car I’ve had all year. Thanks to @FedEx also for making huge contributions to charity this year for each lap led. We will continue to get better.

@bobpockrass #Fakenews by someone trying to control the rhetoric
@NASCAR @WGI @nascarcasm That's always been a side trophy for the glen. They didn't make a primary this year so they moved the shake weight up to the main event.
Everyone is blaming something or someone for their bad finish. I blame Sunoco for not enough gas and Goodyear for not enough grip.
@MicahRoberts7 @NASCAR Hush Micah!
@keselowski I think you will find it hard to convince anyone that the argument and comparisons you described relate in this matter.
@keselowski Oh I didn't know the Xfinity series was exhibition races. I thought those guys were racing for something.
@keselowski No starters for NBA teams play in NBA summer league. And not even their backups. Only exception is new rookies coming into the league
Respect his opinion. However as a competitor I believe it's best years were 09,10 with the asphalt strip in T3. #MPGA #PJ1 @NASCAR https://t.co/F34PXCOQ4m
Track was at its best in 09,10 with the asphalt strip in T3. @Nascar can recreate that in a matter of hours. #MPGA #PJ1 https://t.co/F34PXCOQ4m
@dustinlong @poconoraceway Let's open up a conversation. It might be the "most needed" track to apply it. You cannot move off the bottom. Go up 20-30 ft and spray.
Y'all remember what 1 strip of new pavement did to Pocono 6 years ago. They got that stuff in a bottle now. Do it @poconoraceway! #MPGA #PJ1
Where's da PJ1 at?! Someone bring that sprayer to the middle/top lanes at Pocono. #MPGA

@ClintBowyer Simply saying that ppl thinking that the Cup series should go back to the tracks of the old days just isn't feasible.
@ClintBowyer I'm on 🌏. You're in a dirt fantasy land 😁. I said "eldora is one of the nicest". It's perfect for the truck series..Once a year.
@ClintBowyer Infrastructure, Not accommodations
2. It still struggles with having the infrastructure to make things organized.
1. Fans always talk about how they want us to go to more old short tracks. This is why it's not possible. Eldora is one of the nicest but...

Great response  https://t.co/VaNaz8LlZi
Uh oh... Don't ever do that
I can assure you this decision is one that the DRIVERS helped influence. We live it each week and this is a step in the right direction
Great change by @nascar to double the restart zone. Gives leader more of a opportunity to decide when to start the race.

@JimmyThomasNC not true at all. Racing now more competitive then ever
Isn't it something that we have a no testing policy yet we test almost every week. Most times not even the tire or aero that we actually run
Thanks so much to @kennyhabul and @SE1Solar for sponsoring us this week. Drove as hard as I could to get a win for my friend. Glad we did 🏁

Yes he is.  “@greenbunny7: @dennyhamlin  He's so much fun to watch. Will be even more fun when he gets to play with the Cup boys.”
Watching lap times.. Once the 4 gets out front. It's gonna be bye bye time
.@TheOrangeCone aero issues come from front car punching big hole in air. Reduce the hole, then you will increase passing. Until then,follow
True. Off throttle time=passing “@TheOrangeCone: @dennyhamlin I mean in the respect that you'd like to have more downforce than the others
We do not  “@TheOrangeCone: Of course drivers want aero. especially single-car. But in dirty air, all of that aero only helps the leader.”

@AllWaltrip Just enforce the rules you have. Don't conform to those who go around it
@AllWaltrip no. Just put a stop to it like they did with fender Flairs. Just because someone can do it doesn't mean that everyone should
Safer until they fail and cost you a race.. Just leave the tires alone    “@AllWaltrip: I believe "bleeders" would be a lot safer

Thank everyone who has supported us from the very beginning and know I'm still as hungry for one of these championships as I'll ever be.
We will hold our heads up high knowing we put a championship effort in this last race but things just didn't work out for us in the end

Kickers get no respect in fantasy football. Justin tucker only scored 23 PTS in our league. If a Qb had a career day like that he'd have 70.
Mad guy 👉“@Spenc2u: @dennyhamlin @SportsCenter they have always sucked  they will always suck  they are the league's embarrassment
Not sure what I would be more pissed about. Losing the game on a 61 yd fg, or having to walk up 3 flights of stairs right after.

I'm more mentally tired then after a race I was in. I don't know what watching you're child race is like but I'm sure it's a lot like this

Big congrats to @keselowski and Roger Penske on a job well done. They executed this chase nearly perfect! Well deserved first time champ!
Thanks also to all of my fans who come on here each week and wish me luck. It doesn't go unnoticed.
Man I wanted to end on a better note than that. We just missed it today. Thanks to all of my team for a good year.

“LOL!!  @KevinHarvick: Watch out for water bottles!!! “@keselowski: @dennyhamlin it'll be hard to pay me back if I'm looking at your rear!””
hey @keselowski, would this be a bad weekend for me to pay you back for all those times you wrecked me? i mean i do owe ya a couple.
@keselowski stop looking at my rear end.. I know it looks good!
not sure how qualifying will turn out for us but very confident that we will be fast come sunday! #endonawin!
How did that happen?  @MartySmithESPN: Penske tells me Kes' transition from rough racer to respected racer "And hes done it in just 36 mos."
@mw55 keep dreaming. You're old
@HateyMcHaterton haven't been around that long bud
@MicahRoberts7 @jimmiejohnson I'd say so
@WhosWhoInCLT @butternc bad deal man
@rchilders55 sorry for your loss buddy
Everyone needs love sometimes. Even them   “@StandingInGlory: @dennyhamlin: why do you answer the haters? They just want the attention...”
I like your name “@hamlingirl11: More tweets from @dennyhamlin! This makes my studying much more enjoyable! Can i get a reply Denny? :)”
I bet you were all state in swimming. Congrats!  @Justin24Payne: @dennyhamlin You also will never win a championship.
I do TY!!  “@lOVESj_CON569: I hate how @dennyhamlin only notices his haters. Wish he would notice all the people who really care about him
“What u mean? My career year? 8wins 2 PTS?  @MicrophoneThe: @dennyhamlin @angelbl221 u will have excuse Hamlin. He still can't get over 2010
“Yea your right! LOL @Angelbl221: @dennyhamlin Used to respect you. Only one that should be PARKED is Bowyer for what his CREW did to Jeff.”
@Bigworm336 a cheap shot is not rubbing tires with someone.. That's all that happen
@Bigworm336 never cried about Austin. I ran 200 laps with no problem. He had issues with me afterwards bud.
@jacubi50 hey dipshit. His tire was never cut. Moron
@JayKines just left
“@Sm0ker14: @dennyhamlin did they park you when you promised to, then intentionally took out Brad K. ?” Yea 2 laps
hey @blakeshelton... wanna fight? i already beat up @mw55 worse than the 24 crew guy that got close lined.

On another note.. I'm on a plane with a 2-time daytona 500 champ, 2 time superbowl winning coach, and a player with a superbowl ring as well

hey 24 fans.. @keselowski said worse things than me... go get em LOL!!!
“@ivandebosch: Not talking about today he has been doing it week after week. Love ya” was that meant for me?
“@ivandebosch: "@dennyhamlin BTW it was CB that started the BS” love ya Ingrid but your man was wrong. He wrecked trying to wreck 15 first
Great turnaround week for our FedEx team.. 1 more to go! On another note. The 24 should be parked! He took out 5 cars in that BS!

“@BizNasty2point0: Great dinner with @dennyhamlin in Scottsdale tonight.......”Tell them I just beat ur @$$ in the parking lot.
@BizNasty2point0 you're a d-bag
after a long day in phoenix promoting the race here in 2 weeks I'm finally catching up on the debate tonight..
@ChicagoJasmine @markmulder20 we love entourage!
Damn we sucked today. Time for MAX points.
@Buccigross the hammer.. I like it. Coming to a shirt near you
People in the infield at @kansasspeedway are very nice and polite. Me and @mw55 and @HermieSadler just made a drive through.
@Buccigross @MikeCWheeler sounds like a match between us is needed to settle this.
@jeff_gluck @kaseykahne ray rice.. little and fast
@Buccigross @MikeCWheeler im a little suspect of this.. putt putt golf and games course??
@Buccigross @MikeCWheeler you must play from the ladies tees
Good qualifying effort by my team. They worked hard yesterday after there driver messed up. Race practice tomorrow with much warmer weather
Dear @kansasspeedway.. you're security guards at the motorhome lot are jackasses
“@odsteve: Old school track.  Must.attend #NASCAR http://t.co/dX9L9vNU” my first win in NASCAR came there in 1997. 4cyl class
@Buccigross @sagesteele good to have you today. Too bad @sagesteele got the best of us
Does anyone in the stands at New Hampshire have the full burnout after the race?
@Brett_Griff there are no backups
Sorry to hear about dale jr. Puts things In perspective about what "can" happen.
I absolutely positively cannot wait to get on the racetrack tomorrow. Last week was prevent defense. This week is 5 wide shot gun formation
“@BillB1967: @dennyhamlin anybody that rides in the back is a coward.....and doesn't care at all about his fans.- I care about championships
Sorry folks. Not the way I wanna race but I needed to just survive today. I'll make it up to you at Charlotte
“@mscott_11: @dennyhamlin Bigger Beatdown : Romney last night or your New Hampshire win?” Ouch.. I'd say Romney
After last night it's very obvious who I want to run this country. #registertovote
@ChrisHancock11 @saucehockey haha awesome
“@rchilders55: I really hate when someone pisses you off first thing in the morning.. It kinda ruins your day..” Give em the finger
“@TheAlexHayden: A rainly, dreary Monday morning....Perfect for a guy with absolutely nothing to do today!” 10 4 to that
My teammate deserved to win today.People that judge him for being upset are crazy. Walk a mile in their shoes. Losers are happy about losing
Me winning a fuel mileage race.. "Well that was awesome. I just managed to be a little bit slower then the field there at the end to win it"
Fuel mileage... Lol.
AJ is pissed.. just watched it on youtube.. funny
Holy cow..
I'm now live on the FedEx Facebook page with @MartySmithESPN. Come check it out: http://t.co/36V05LhT #DennyChat

“@bobpockrass: Is Drew Herring making a case he should get the KBM  18 truck ride next year? #nascar” yes
Mistakes happen.. As soon as we execute we will perform. Good news is it looks like we can run a 28.9 in race trim lol
There are too many variables in NASCAR to insure anything. Strategy, reliability, weather, cautions, pit crew ect.. 1 thing we have? #faith
If each driver in the chase didn't think he could win each week, he would be lacking the confidence that it takes to actually make it happen
Not really sure what all the buzz in the media is about my tweet last week. I didn't guarantee, didn't promise, just made a statement .
@DerekBOhlen yes sir
“@kaseykahne: Hey @dennyhamlin check out this photo I just hung up on the wall at KKR http://t.co/7VymeXBo” that's just wrong.. Rematch?
I strongly recommend @JimmieJohnson  book "on the road". Got to see it in Chicago. Great stuff
He's one of the best in the garage. Took courage to come up to me after and apologize. #teamwork
Scott wood is my gas man. Been with me since the beginning. He came up to me after the race and said he just made a bad mistake.
This is 1 week of 10. We will win next week.
Hard not to be disappointed after driving back up to the top 4 before the last stop. Didn't get car full and ran out with 2 to go.
wow that last lap was going to be close with castro coming quick
Does anyone else find it weird how these indy car spotters tell these guys how they should drive every lap? id be like stfu and spot
Just finished up for the day, two thumbs 👍

“@zannerluvs18 Hey Denny. If it comes down to the last lap. Would u move over &amp; let the 18 win so he's in the chase?” impossible scenario
Crash in turn 2 http://t.co/W7auD9bi

Excited to add @mattkenseth to our @joegibbsracing team. He will be a huge asset for us next year. Also sad to lose @joeylogano.

@KevinHarvick 10-4 on that
Heck u know what's coming anyway.. 36 will exchange points with 10 to make sure they are good anyway.. Poor Blaney
Why is everyone so pissed at Reutimann? His car was broke. Wasnt the 5 broke too and knew it but stayed out till it blew up anyway?
Not a stellar day for our FedEx team. Tried a new setup and just never got it to work. Glad to have a week to regroup.
the winner will have to be someone who choose 11 as there mega ball.. photo proof required!
IF the power ball number is 11 i will give away one of my fire suits to one of my followers
For a measly 167 million you can garantee that you have a winning ticket. then you just hope and pray nobody else hits it! #everynumbercombo
Practice went.. umm uhhh "OK" today. wish we had a little more speed but after i win the mega millions tonight... IT'S ON!!!
Team Va gets smoked by @KevinHarvick and @austindillon3 team.. #homecourt

great job by the18 nationwide team today. felt good to get back racing nationwide.. close finish i needed 1 more lap! congrats to @Tbayne21
just higher speeds and a championship contender involved. see my comments on speed channel last week after the race for my opinion.
ok my 1 voice of reason during this time of chaos.. what just happened is not much different then what happened last week 20 times..
how about Speed Channel posting twitter comments during the race.. added drama. kinda like it
there is 1 twitter account i feel really bad for... @odsteve lol
oh man.. not good
Sorry fans. Frustrating not getting a win with a car that good but just got stuck on every restart.. #movingforward
Freese= Ice in Veins
In my humble opinion i think last nights game will give the Cards the momentum that they need.  i think they win it
@BenJReiling im with ya bud.. i think last night is gonna be big momentum for them
Anybody else jacked for game 7 tonight?
@JimmieJohnson @martysmithespn I'm with ya there.. Bring it on. It can't come soon enough.
@JimmieJohnson @MartySmithESPN easy bud.. dont get so defensive.. listen to the whole thing first my man. why so jumpy?
@bwalke11 happy bday
everyone make sure they wish @MissJFish a happy birthday tomorrow.
Im just kiddin.. love jj and ck. Both very "smart". They know when to push.
its a narrow front stretch at martinsville.. hopefully we wont "crack" the back of the truck if we do donuts lol
looking forward to racing KBM's truck this weekend.. never won a truck race. id say this is a great opportunity for that.
How can the ravens be losing to a team this bad?
2 car drafts come from cars being too slow.. If we speed them up in single car runs we wouldn't have to push.. It's coming soon..
Everyone be patient with NASCAR on these plate tracks. Finding the happy medium between speed and safety tough.
Proud of my Fedex team today.. It was a battle. Thanks to my teammates for helping at the end.

@MxDaD324 who says i wonder?
ok ive reached my twitter limit for the day.. its time everyone just worries about themselves.. me included.. go tcu.
richard might have a compelling enough case to convince them and this will all go away for them. nobody wants to be called a cheater
we all want a level playing field. Nascar just has to make that happen and facts are facts.. they had no choice.
sorry all RCR fans.. im not bashing clint, richard or anyone else.. just defending Nascar on this one.. all these teams work damn hard
@bjhoppy how about i just do YOU a favor and block you so you dont see anything.. will that help?
great qualifying run for our team.. kinda unexpected. looking forward to tcu/smu game tonight.. who ya got?
fyi i have nothing against bowyer. i like him as a driver and person. he didnt build the cars so i feel bad for him.
@jefftomascak I thought u were a mercedes man?

@jeff_gluck in football u decide your own fate... patriots just got beat.. they didnt have bad luck or somebody spin in front of them..
the entire race gets about 20 secs worth of mentioning.. about the same as 1 baseball game or less.
heres something to chew on..  watch sportscenter any given sunday night.. the races blow other sports out of the water in ratings but....
@JennaFryer ok so dude can win 26 of first 26 races. have 1 blown motor or wreck in first 2 chase races.. then hes done.. give me a break
if we havent noticed already.. the more we change stuff the lower the ratings get.
why do we keep wanting to change chase format.. bc 1 guy has won 4 in a row?? i mean damn he deserved it.
In bristol again today for tire test.. Hoping to quit early today
