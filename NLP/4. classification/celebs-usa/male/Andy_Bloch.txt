@wsop Will the One Drop make the money on each day 1 heat? I'm guessing no because of the 10k in chips. Can you forfeit chips?
@WSOP Thanks for clarifying that. Maybe you could correct the pdf structure sheet to avoid confusion?
@devopoker @WSOPcom It's also not re-entry, it's a re-buy. You keep the same seat at the same table. Because of legacy software.
@SavagePoker @25kfantasy @key_poker What page is that from? List at https://t.co/F5wL21QHiW shows Ryan with 12, Michael and Naoya with 11
@SavagePoker So no protection for people who think they got colluded against by being raised out of a pot.
The https://t.co/AXWKfktQGu bracelet event is a rebuy, not a re-entry. It can matter for people's decision to rebuy. @wsop @wsoptd
@KarinaJett @ninjapokergirl @TonyImrunninout There are some fair reasons for a man to enter the ladies event, but a prop bet is not one
@SavagePoker @WSOPTD can players request to see hands at showdown?
@SavagePoker Players should be encouraged to always announce the full number. "Four hundred", not "four" that can sound like "fold"
@SavagePoker Why not just ask for a clarification?
@balconybash @tchanpoker @WSOP yes, a grueling 2 hours, so much more grueling than 6 or 8 hours of a regular tournament
@tchanpoker @WSOP player at my table argued it was an edge to come in heads up. He prob thinks a big stack has an ev advantage heads up too
@wsop Why blind off late players in a shootout but not a regular poker tournament?
@SavagePoker paired board on 4th in stud. Player asks "what's the maximum I can bet?" Dealer says 300. Player bets 1k chip. Ruling?

@AllenKessler @jaredjaffee21 What if there were 255 entrants? 254 players get $5k back, what should the rake be?
@AllenKessler @jaredjaffee21 That's WSOP's spin. They failed to make the structure and rake clear b4 and should be held to the lower rake
@AllenKessler @jaredjaffee21 That's because AFAIK they don't post the payouts or if they will use byes or how the $5k refunds are raked.
@AllenKessler @jaredjaffee21 Not difficult at all if you have byes and carry chips forward. Anyway, where is any of this posted?
@AllenKessler @jaredjaffee21 https://t.co/qsfxB6fXqE
@AllenKessler @jaredjaffee21 If it was preset, where is the info posted? Nowhere. Today they changed https://t.co/tQXZ0om554

@WSOPTD @wsopSUITd @WSOP @Kevmath Taking $600 out of $5k and counting it as a cash is BS and you know it.
@dennycaps1 did you try to play again after getting barred, or were you doing anything else besides counting?

@WSOP @wsopSUITd @WSOPTD In less than 3 hour period after bubble, half of those remaining will bust - 25% of starting field.
@WSOP @wsopSUITd @WSOPTD So, your answer is no, you have no plan, even though long lines are guaranteed if there is a decent turnout.
@wsopSUITd @WSOPTD @WSOP Do you guys have a plan for handling payouts in the 50/50, so people won't have to wait in line for hours?

@wsopSUITd @WSOP @WSOPTD Do you need GCB approval to change day 1 end times to 12:45 instead of 3am (in all 4pm events)?
@MattGlantz @WSOPTD A better quick fix would have been getting rid of 2 doubled levels and stopping play at 12:45.
@WSOPTD No need for any doubled levels.
@WSOPTD But still playing until 3am! Not going to play. Also, get rid of 250-500 from limit tournaments. Dealers constantly making change.
@WSOP Still playing until 3am, so thanks but still won't play. And take out slow 250-500 levels where dealers are constantly making change.
@wsopSUITd @WSOP @WSOPTD If new decks are on the way, no reason to conserve old decks.
@wsopSUITd @WSOP @WSOPTD Please instruct the floor that they should replace entire decks, not just individual marked cards.
@ShaneSchleger @WSOP Unfortunately, this is how they've always dealt with marked cards.

@Donnie_Peters @Protentialmn Ridiculous. I can't imagine their rationale for this system. Is it the same as the GPI?
@foxpokerfox @WSOP You can still enter late, 6 or 8 levels in. What about 4pm tournaments?
Facebook discussion on @WSOP late day 1 ending times: https://t.co/VBRhs181b2 @wsopSUITd @WSOPTD
How many of you @WSOP players dislike the 2am or 3am day 1 end times? Should tournaments start earlier, or play fewer levels on day 1?
@Donnie_Peters @Protentialmn @shaundeeb @paulgees81 Real example of POTY point system problem. Two 2nds and a min shouldn't be &gt; 2 firsts
@olegsmith Which course?
@WSOP @wsopSUITd @wsop Gaming won't let you change structures, but can you change 4pm events to 8 levels on day 1 &amp; let people enter day 2?
@shaundeeb @WSOP @WSOPTD I've said that for years. Or pay 1 player per 9 entrants a fixed amount so % itm is always same &amp; payouts simpler
@JustinBonomo chip leader according to http://t.co/AXWKfktQGu, or the actual chip leader?

@djmacjr @WSOPTD It's also not fair that some people get Aces more than others in a tournament.
@gunslingerbach @WSOPTD @WSOP no 250-500 on limit and pot limit! Annoying level for making change/calculating the pot and waste of an hour
@djmacjr @WSOPTD it's logistically simple to go from 9 max to 6 max. Start at 9, don't break tables until every table is 6 or less.
@WSOPTD 6 max (or less) with 40 min levels. Better structure, 2/3 of the time. Or start 9 handed, as players bust drop to 6.
@WSOPTD should do something similar for main event. Day 1s and 2s throughout the month.

@Stripes300 I didn't say I won, I just played it perfectly. All two hands.
Played my last tournament absolutely perfectly!
In the money in WSOP $3k PLO 8, with 164,500.
3 players from the money. I have about 190k after busting David Bach's AAxy, making a straight on the turn with AQJ5hhss
86,800 on 2nd break WSOP $3k PLO 8. About 72 players left, 54 make the money.
Had a lot of big hands preflop, but somehow only won 100.

@WSOP monster stack should take ~5 levels longer than regular $1500 with same # of players. Milly maker took 37 levels, so figure 42
@WSOPTD what's the max for heat A, and how close are you to selling out? Maybe 15% will bust by 5, so you might need to cap B too.
@WSOPTD Why not give people a choice: start at level 1, finish at 3:30am, or start at level 5 and get done at 10:50pm?
@WSOPTD tell alternates to come back at 5pm and they can start at level 5. Logistically, is it more difficult than starting at level 1?
@WSOPTD Logistically, why can't people late reg for flight A instead of entering B and playing until 3:30am? Uses same number of tables!
@WSOPTD Have @PokerNews post modified structure as an update, then tweet link. Just a suggestion, thanks for your quick responses here
@WSOPTD would be nice if you had someone update the structure sheets online. Still 60 minute levels &amp; 20 minute breaks every 2 levels?
@WSOPTD is flight B also 11 levels or does it skip levels? Can you still enter A at dinner break instead?

First year in a while that I'm at the WSOP main event opening ceremony. I'm at table 439 seat 8.
Blackjack episode of @ThisAmerLife is rerunning this week. I try to teach @IraGlass how to count cards. http://t.co/6mVsMmOlJ1
Busted out in 182nd place in Little One Drop, now doing live commentary for 2-7 triple draw on ESPN stream
In the money in the little one for One Drop, only need to outlast 400 more players to make a profit
@WSOPTD How long are the breaks tonight in the $50k?
@idw10 different Andy Bloch
Going from $1500 to $2500 lost 1/3 of field, for a 13% increase in prize pool. Going from $5k to $10k loses only 14% of field.
2012 @wsop $1500 stud had 367 players &amp; $495,450 prize pool; $5k: 145 &amp; $681,500; 2011 $10k: 126 &amp; $1,184,400; 2013 $2500: 246 &amp; $559,650.
If Boehner says Prism is OK, then I'm OK with Prism. He knows which liberties we must sacrifice to fight terrorism. Such as online poker.
Made day 2 of Event 18 $1000 No-Limit with 23,800. In the money, but well below avg. I've got work to do to avoid a 3rd min cash this WSOP
Finish day 1 of event 15, $1500 HORSE, w 47,900. Avg is 22k. 177 players left, 96 players make the money. Should take about 3 hours.
@shortbuspoker In 1996, my 1st year, vig on $1500 and $2500 was $60. On $5000, $80. On $10k, 0. Tips discretionary. http://t.co/gDonk6Iw7S
@ShaneSchleger WSOP reported that players have "won" $27,352,360 thus far. With vig of 8-10% of buy ins, that means vig of close to $3M
@NormanChad Have you been to the @wsop poker kitchen? Starbucks' protein smoothies are about half the price
Players at the @WSOP have won $27M thus far, lost $30M, net -$3M.
Happy I busted event 13 at 6 and not now. It's midnight and they are still a table away from $. Cut day 1 levels in half next year please!
@Dcubedzin great video. I didn't know you had two identical twins. ;)
@EmilyJillette what time was she actually born? That's when you should wake her, midnight is arbitrary.
@WSOPTD if the tournament started 9 handed, more players would have busted day 1 and you wouldn't need 10 handed tables day 2.
Cards are in the air for flight B. Only 20 minutes late.
@Ray_Henson @WSOPTD They should be able to reg 1 person per minute per window. With 20 windows, that's 1200 per hour.
@billchenpoker where'd you get the stickers?
Long lines at WSOP reg thanks in part to 3 empty windows. Wonder how many players they lose.
@NormanChad @WSOPTD Rule 40 violation? ;)
@ejkomenda thanks!
@wsoptd Are the payout structures posted online anywhere? What about the Participant Release Form?
@wsoptd If a Rio janitor asks to see my hole cards during a hand, do I have to show? Rule 24. http://t.co/kBVp9SWrjo
@WSOPTD Is saying rule 40 sucks a violation of rule 40? http://t.co/kBVp9SWrjo .
@MikeMcDonald89 Nice team! Homework pays off.
To clarify my last tweet: I was told a couple weeks ago that Caesars would not allow them to attend. "86" based on prior history, not recent

@goingontilt You can play freerolls for cash but not for tournament entries.
@Professor_Tilt US players can play a freeroll, as long as the prize isn't an entry into another tournament.

@wndywitch We just played 5 weeks where even $1500 events took 2 days to cash. I wouldn't play the WSOP if it wasn't the WSOP.
@wndywitch Giving people a choice whether they want to play 1, 2, or 3 days until the money is a good thing.
@wndywitch $10k tournaments shouldn't take 4 days to get into the money. I value my time, so being able to play 1 day to get to $ is great
Just pointing out areas where the @WSOP could be improved. I don't think any other casino would have handled the growth of the WSOP as well
Bellagio chairs are way better than Rio. Comp for 2 to Bellagio buffet for each day you're in vs. $10 WSOP food voucher

Out of the Bellagio $1k rebuy like anyone cares.
They burst the bubble at Bellagio.
The bubble race is on! H4H at Bellagio WPT & WSOP. WPT a favorite to burst the bubble first. How many still in started today?
Thought WSOP rule was no breaks hand-for-hand, but h4h can take so long prob a good decision. Or did @wsoptd bet on all-star game?
The WPT is down to 54 & they are pausing for a full redraw so I still think WSOP is a favorite to make the money first.
Who will reach the money first? WSOP or WPT? WPT pays 50 and 56 left... I'd bet on WSOP
@eugenetoddbro you can buy in for 4k at the break, at about 5:40. You'll get 40k in chips, just like the WPT!

@taopauly @JoeGersten Flashbacks from youth... whatever you do, don't let them feed the watermelon to the dog!
@davidallendos depends on all the other rules.  If the rules are the same, then single deck.
I was just telling @jencreason that you should do that! RT @SavagePoker: @WorldPokerTour Bellagio registration now open until day 3
@patrissimo "god willing" in the cruise description? Is that sarcasm? Doesn't seem to mesh with Reason
@goldman If you had a WFPokerTableOniPad policy I'd think about getting a real job.
@dutchinamerica No listings in Vegas :(
Where are the Dutch fans watching world cup tomorrow?
@whipartist Wasn't me on the drums.  But it's about to be me.  Can I recommend buying him some brushes and pads?
@bspadaro01 Cash. 1k-2k OE.
The good news is what I won last night on Full Tilt would have taken a week more to win at the WSOP and I get a weeks vacation.
Out. Turned a set, opponent rivered a flush.
@change100 Worst seat cushions ever.  Maybe you could try smoking them though.
Lost 2 pots the last round, ended day with 37,300. Will be at table 367 seat 6 Saturday.
Doubled up to 49k just before my table broke.

@SavagePoker I guess I needed a day job. (Actually, there are 2 Andrew Blochs living in Vegas. If you play at Rampart look him up.)
No noises, but I think Lucas tried to shift RT @VirginRacing: @Andy_Bloch Did Lucas make engine noises when he was driving? ;-)
@LucasdiGrassi Thanks! It was fun filming the videos and even more fun getting driven around by you.
Just let my brother drive me through Red Rock in my @teslamotors roadster... @LucasdiGrassi is a hard act to follow
@WSOP @wsoptd You should update WSOP.com with the latest Day 1 schedule change. Also, the 1b/1c swap story is no longer on the home page
@WSOP why not let people enter at end of 3rd level since you pushed back dinner break?
@WSOP @wsoptd how late can one sign up to play tomorrow? I thought about playing after level 2 but now the dinner break has been moved.
Just drove @VirginRacing F1 driver @LucasDiGrassi in my @teslamotors car, then switched seats. Wow!
@PhilNoLimits then he gave me a hug after he got out and was still dripping. Thankfully he had on a towel.
Uhoh, I think I'm getting flashbacks. http://twitpic.com/22l9zz
To the people who decided to have dinner breaks at 4:20: what were you smoking?
For the first 4 days of the main event, "dinner" at 4:20.  This structure was designed for the over-60 and under-30 crowd!
With 4 levels a day, the WSOP might not reach the money until day 5!  Last year, with same blinds, bubble burst at end of level 16.
@tropicalsteve I'm not on the committee.
@RafeFurst Does it count as a bracelet?
Congrats Phil! RT @RefugeesIntl: phil gordon is the winner of @anteupforafrica! immediately donates all of his winnings!
Just looked at the main event structure sheet. Playing only 4 levels days 1-5 with a 90 minute dinner break after level 2? Seriously?
Warning: when choosing main event starting day, day 1b plays on 2b and day 1c plays on 2a. WSOP has done an appalling job getting word out
Erik Seidel just did something Johnny Chan couldn't do, beat Matt Damon in a pot (in Ante Up got Africa)

Thanks everyone for all the birthday wishes! Didn't get to win a bracelet on my birthday but starting on one or two.
Playing the $5k shootout now, my table is full of young internet stars plus David Singer. This ain't going to be easy.
However, I have bubbled 8, 7 & 6 handed finals, and bubbled the $. Also, I have more wins than other places... just not in WSOP. :(
Looking at my poker stats at http://is.gd/cxMzy I've never cashed 10th in a tournament... which means I've never bubbled a 9-handed final
@theWSOG thanks, almost 25k for you to start the series!
Eating at Naked Fish, right under my plate. Sen of Japan is closed today btw
16th pays $98,330.  3 cashes in the five years. Going to play the 5k shootout at noon tomorrow, early day for me.

@SavagePoker What's happening at the opening? Now that I'm out of the last big tournament of the year I have some free time.
Out of Bellagio WPT, all in preflop for 87k with 77 v 44, flop was 456, and I missed.
54,500. 2 levels to go tonight. 3k-6k blinds, need a couple of double ups! I've moved tables a couple of times. Jesus is on my right now
Big blind shows just a ten, no kicker, and wins the pot.
Flop KQx, check check. Turn 10, check bet call. River blank, check, big bet, slow call. Bettor says you got me, pocket jacks & mucks
Completely card dead, down to 87,600 at break. Average is 232k. There was just a weird hand at my table. Button limped, small blind folded
Lost a few pots, 137,800 at break with 107 players left in Bellagio WPT, avg is 185k
My steals are going well today, raised with 52s on cutoff and turned 2 pair to make 50k off of Hasan Habib. 190k
Late-comer Hasan Habib just sat down to my left. Average age has gone up, but does this make my table any easier?
I am easily the old man at my new table, as they pointed out to me in the first few hands. (Tough table)
Just started day 3 of WPT Bellagio with 123k. Won 40k first hand, was on a steal with A4 and cracked KK when an ace flopped.
lol! Congrats! RT @katewrightson: I just submitted my final paper via in-flight internet somewhere over Oklahoma. I feel like @Andy_Bloch!
End of day 2 at Bellagio, I have 123,800. Avg is about  150k, about 130 players left. Restart tomorrow at noon PT.
Anyone else I'd be worried. Ivey looks to be up 500k at dice RT @KristyArnett: floor guy came & said "good news, ivey's not playing"
117,100 with 1 level to go in day 2 at Bellagio WPT. Avg is 130k 153 players left
129k at Bellagio WPT. Avg is 104k. Total of 328 entrants with 189 still in.
Up to 87,600 at break from WPT Bellagio, from 60k start. I won 1 pot but it was the right 1. My friend Russell Rosenblum is on my right.

So far, I've been tweeting more than the birds across the aisle. I think they're sleeping.
No non-stop red-eyes from LAS to the DC area, so I'm flying AirTran. So far, exceeded their reputation and they have wifi on all planes
@EricSan It's @RealAnnieDuke
@fireballil Not sure when it's going to air.  @Poker_Prod , do you know yet when the Charity in Mind week is airing?

@jordanwebb88 Check www.seatguru.com for seats w inflight power (and type), sometimes only 1st class.
@anthony_wilson I was willing to fly a crappy airline & connect through Atlanta, I'd happily pay more or fly a few hours earlier or later
@jordanwebb88 fyi, the touchpad on my Air doesn't work sometimes when it's plugged into an airplane seat plug, very weird
@cprpoker You're welcome.
@jordanwebb88 Yes, most planes w/wifi have power outlets. Sometimes they don't work with my MacBook air so I have an external battery

Does anyone know of a website that tracks planes with wifi? Any of you want to start one or should I start my own?
@weswong8 I've had wifi on Delta flights between LAS and JFK all but 1 of my last 4-6 flights?
AA.com has a widget to tell within 24hrs if a flight will have wifi. Delta, time to catch up! I wish Virgin had more flights to Vegas.
@loudersoft I agree, but the fact that I was willing to fly AirTran anyway is a hint as to how much I value knowing that I'll have wifi
Decided not to take AirTran through Airtlanta and instead gambling that Delta flight will have wifi. Agent guessed it would but not certain

Tough choice between playing a coin flip all in 1st hand tomorrow and losing 10M but making final 9, unless you only care about bracelet!
Unfortunately I will miss the brutally slow pace at the WSOP tomorrow, though I predict it will be down to 9 in about 6 levels.
The $263k difference between 13th and 12th is worth about 3M at least in chips, when average is about 15M.

Lost a hand near the end of the level in stud hi. I had (QA)QQK2 v. (??)55x5. Bet the max on 4th & folded 6th. 130k #WSOP49
If you don't rule the hand a misdeal, the 1st player can angle shoot, raising if he has a good H hand, otherwise pointing out the error.
All hands should be dead because no player has the right number of cards. Floor made a bad ruling and said action stands. #WSOP49
Dealer changed the sign to Omaha, but only dealt 2 cards and there was a raise but caught b4 big blind acted. Hand should be dead... #WSOP49

Restart tomorrow is being pushed to 4pm & we're only going to play 5 levels. Will be lucky if we're down to half he field by then.
Rolled up as bringin in stud hi lo with a 3 up, scooped a big 3 way pot against 2 opponents. Up to 194,500 I think. #WSOP49
Steve Zolotow was the first out. Avg is 151,600 lol. I have 164k. #WSOP49
10:30 and first player is out of $50k horse. Not sure who it was. #WSOP49
I think this 1800-3600 level might give me an edge, but it's too much of a pain. Skip it and make the levels 100 minutes maybe. #WSOP49
173k at break. No need for 20 minute break every 90 minutes! 15 minutes or maybe alternate 10 & 20
Good razz round, up to 173k & half of table now on full tilt! #WSOP49

I don't like triple chips. Players play better because limits seem higher & it wastes time early. Plus there was a beauty to the old way
Bought into the $50k HORSE #WSOP49 just before end of second level. Lost 3 antes and a bring in. 93 entrants so far
@JeffreyPollack & @WSOPTD or anyone else who knows, whats the latest we can register for the $50k HORSE?
Now that WSOP delayed the start of the HORSE, I'll probably just show up later.  They should skip most of the 1st level so ends at same time
I haven't bought in yet to the $50k HORSE because I want to skip the 1st level w/ 90+ big bets & I want to be fresher at end of nite

In some places, last aggressive action is 1st to show, even if it was before the river. At the WSOP, if checked around, it's by position.
Reading WSOP Dealer Reference Guide... says that last aggressor is supposed to show hand first on showdown. Is that the rule?

@SavagePoker: How's Jerry Buss  doing in the $335 Stud 8 now? Buss FTW! I'm sure that would make his night.
Ways to improve poker tournament structure: skip early levels, add or lengthen levels late, use short time clocks, and short handed.
This physics paper shows that growth of the blinds entirely controls the pace (starting stack doesn't matter): http://bit.ly/7KL33
@allenkessler More chips won't help, just wastes time. Only slower structures or faster play will improve stack sizes late in a tourney
Game hasn't started yet! Bet he's out by 3rd Q RT @SavagePoker: Dr. Jerry Buss still in the Omaha Tournament. How can he concentrate?

We've just restarted the 25k "high roller" poker tournamnet in monte carlo. I won the blinds in the first hand, 54k, 1/2 average. 36 left
@Shanarock1 After the Monte Carlo tournament, I'm not planning on playing any live poker until the WSOP.  I will play the WSO Golf though
We started with 79 players and there are 30-something left so the average is well over 100k. Second pays around 400k?
@ThatKevinSmith I would have bid but I was too busy donkeying off chips playing poker.
A combination of bad play and bad cards and I ended the night with 50,700. Around 36 players left. We restart tomorrow at noon local time
130k going into the last level of the nite, 600-1200 100 ante. 46 players still left out of 79 starting.
Just lost a big pot. Doubled up Dan Shak. We both turned a flush. His was the nuts. I should have got away cheaper.  133k.
I busted Ivey. I raised with K4dd Ivey called, BB called. Flop Kh4h3d, we got it all in. Ivey KT. Up to 210k. http://yfrog.com/663fbj
Ivey was getting abused, down to 15k, but he doubled up with KTdd against 55. Ivey's shoe invading my space! http://yfrog.com/4l8ewj
Beat Ivey for 13,500 and won the next hand, up to 163k.

The good news is I doubled up. The bad news is I got crippled just b4, AQ v. QT QT2 flop, 3rd short stack all in too. Ended with 33,700.
Caught someone bluffing on the river. Tough call for 20k with top pair no kicker, and possible flush, but looked like a bluff. At 92k
69,000 with 2 levels to go tonight.
@TheEngineer2008 Didn't see poker mentioned in that article or another which mentioned the wire act. Can you double check and find the list?
End of level 5. 66,825. Lots of action at my table but not involving me :(
Dipped down to 68,800. 2nd break. Blinds will be 150-300 with 25 ante. Attn twitterers in MC, there's wifi in the tournament room.

Jd7c5d flop, I had a set of 7s against the nut flush draw, all in on the flop. No more diamonds so I'm over 75k now.
Caught someone trying to push me around. Called bets on every street with 2nd pair. Something just didn't seem right. 37k
First break. 27,700. Not much exciting happening. Best hands were AJ and 22, no straight flushes.
2 inch guy out. Unfortunately I didn't get any of his chips. 30,250.
Tables are too wide. Seat 4 bets 2 inches from himself every time and dealer can't reach. But he just bluffed off over half his chips

@RealAnnieDuke Tell The Commish not to make the same mistake with the structures as the Bellagio. I may play half as many tournaments.
What's worse than losing $25,500 on a poker tournament?  Wasting 3 days doing it.  I almost wish I was @phil_hellmuth .
Will everyone who thinks the Bellagio structure is too slow in the beginning (and too fast the last 3 levels) please tell Jack McClellan!
Time to stuff my sorrows from busting out with sushi from sushi Mon.
TT, I raised to 20k, 2 callers. Flop was 862, I bet 50, big blind raised me all, I called. He showed 86o, and I didn't improve.
Lost a pot. 208k at break. One level to go today. 79 players left. @RealAnnieDuke I want hard cash or full tilt poker transfer!
@RealAnnieDuke bummer.  But where's my $10?
I had JJ, btw. At least it was cheap.
Finally got a pair higher than 77.  Raised in hijack, got 3 callers.  Flop is a23. I fold to a bet, Dutch boyd raises and take the pot. 250k
AJ against big blind. Flop was J44 two clubs.  I bet, he pushed and I called 95k total. He showed KcTc. 4 on turn, blank on river. now 248k
2k- 4k to 3k 6k??!!%|€{€}*{* 50% jump at this stage? This structure FUCKING SUCKS!!!!  Waste of 2 days, now this.
Should have a pair higher than 77 or AK at least once an hour.  It's been 4.5 hours, and not hitting flops either.  Down to 97.5 at break.
2nd break of the day.  Slipped down to 160k.
@RealAnnieDuke $100 if you can get ivey to tweet before the clock gets down to 45:00.  Last longer?
Lost a pot, then doubled up with aq against per ummer after making trip queens.  219k
@RealAnnieDuke getting interviewed on patio during break.  Nice weather to be inside playing poker :( [?]
Didn't win a pot until 2 minutes left in the level, then just won the blinds.  146k and big blind next hand.
Day 3 of the WPT championship at Bellagio is about to begin.  I have 239,500, a little above average.  Negreanu is to my right with 35k.

239,500 at end of day.  Slightly less than half the field left.  We start again at   noon tomorrow.
@kristygazes where's my 50 dimes last longer?
Last break of the day.  Up to 178k, but was over 220 mid way through level.  195 players left.  Will we get down to 169 - 1/2 the field?
Slipped down to 120k.  On break, 800-1600 200 ante when we come back.
Chris 'jesus' Ferguson possibly signing up for twitter while we play. http://twitpic.com/3op0u
@ShadowBJ21 vanessa r. and erica shoenberg were at my table, but it broke. I'm now playing with Jesus. trying to convince him to twitter
Lost 3 hands in near succesion, -50k, -10k, -10k.  Down to 132k.  It's still a bit above avg though
@EdReif can't tweet about bluffs beacause there are at least two twittererers at the table.  Plus, I never bluff, except on twitter
207,800 on the break.  Somehow I've lost 1000 on the day so far.  Next level 600-1200, 200 ante.
Kit Kat using Chris 'Jesus' Ferguson for viral marketing? http://is.gd/tx61
Just lost about 20k to a flush on the river.  191k at break.  279 players left, 500-1000 blinds, 100 ante.
Getting ready to start day 2 at the Bellagio with 208,800 in chips. At my table: Johnny chan with 291k, erica schoenberg & vanessa rousso
Encores were great, I think they fixed the sound.  Ended with sgt peppers. Glad I came to see the show.
At mccartney concert.  Wow, the sound really sucks, and I don't think it's pauls voice, unless they are trying cover for it!
Person I invited to McCartney can't make it. Anyone want to come? If so, call or D me if you can be at the Hard Rock by about 8.
Had post-walk brunch at Cracked Egg with Penn Jillette & gang. Off to practice golf. Got McCartney tix for tonight at charity auction

The sun is shining directly in to the Fontana lounge where the tournament is held.  The lounge faces east, so it's a rare event at 6:40pm
I've had 32 suited twice since the first level and have been very tempted to play, but folded to raises.   would not have won.
Just rivered a flush against seidel with qs6s.  Q53 flop 1 spade. Turn 7s river As.  He paid off a 10k bet on river.  Up to 203k
End of level 3. 184k.  Kind of bored. Next level is 200-400 with 50 ante.  What happened to 150-300?  Why start with 100k then skip levels?
@joesebok guess I am good luck!
189,000 at break.  Next level 100/200 with 25 ante.  About to get interviewed for WPT website.  The Bellagio fountains just spit on me
@SavagePoker 222 includes early buy ins for tomorrow.  Only about 107 starters today.
First break,  hanging steady with 183k.  Had AK run into AA and KK but it only cost me my 300 raise preflop :)
Guy who lost 80k to my sf busted, erik seidel took his seat.  First bad beat of the tournament.
decided to play 3d2d, rivered a straight flush on board of 6d4d4c2c...5d, almost doubled up, at 185k!  Guess it was worth staring on time
Tournament is about to start.  100k starting chips, 50/100 blinds.  Way too low IMO.
Heading out to work.  Bellagio WPT championship.
@LaceyJones ai carumba!
The charity auction part is getting expensive, already in for $11,100.  Anyone want to come to dinner with joe Montana at n9ne?
Out! Pushed with 98s, called by AK
Doubled up then tripled up.  9000.  Soon I might really have to try losing
Uhoh, David gray doubled me up.  1800 now
Yes.yes.  YES!!! AA cracked by 88.  Down to 900.
YES! Just rivered a 9 high straight when my opponent rivered the nut straight. Down to 4900
7k at the break. Hoping for a bad beat soon!  Planning to play the Bellagio 25k tomorrow.
Trying to bluff off my chips so I can rebuy but they keep folding!
Correction, NSPCA, not ASPCA charity tourn.
Finally got to my seat at Jen harman's ASPCA charity tourn. Here's @RealAnnieDuke taking twitpic of me. http://twitpic.com/3hq20
Went to sleep ~midnight woke up at 2AM, then woke up at 5AM, then 7. Had strange dreams which I forgot already. Golf lesson in an hour.
Finally in Vegas.  Almost home, can't wait to sleep.  Lots to do tommorow.
@DannyKA Just playing sngs right now on Full Tilt Poker #poker
@dwpoker How's it going in seat 2F?
Dinner - though not too hungry after the lounge - curried veggies.  Pretty tasty actually http://twitpic.com/3fn4b
Sitting across from another poker player who tweets and looks like he's about to log in
@Swtness34 It's under the private tournaments, find me on FTP and you'll find it
Gogo RT @RafeFurst: @Andy_Bloch what's the internet service on your plane? http://bit.ly/uK02c
Very happy to be rejoining the mile high club (playing online poker, what did you think I was talking about?) http://twitpic.com/3fkgn
Almost tripled up with KK preflop, chip leader.
Now tweeting from the airplane.  Got on just in time for the twitter tournament on Full Tilt Poker! http://twitpic.com/3fjxw
About time we have wifi on planes again!  I'm flying VA because of it. RT @AlwaysBluff: @Andy_Bloch Internet on the plane is so the nuts.
@cprpoker @sebastianrocks  Going to play the twitter tournament on FTP tonight, while flying back to Vegas.  9pm ET http://bit.ly/mYwHD
Had a yummy chicken tandoori & eggplant in the Virgin Atlantic lounge. However, internet access is choppy.  Might be better on the plane!
If waiting for a plane was always as nice as a Virgin Atlantic lounge, I'd always get to airports hours early.
Just landed, great flight and seat.  I highly recommend OpenSky if you're flying between JFK and Amsterdam or Paris.
My seat, or should I say, where I'll be ensconed [sic] & twitterless for the next few hours.  http://twitpic.com/3eazx
I think someone may have had too much tofu on the last flight, we are waiting for the lav to get fixed. Fortunately I have 4 hour layovr JFK
@howardhlederer I just checked, ILVTOFU "is not suitable" in Nevada either!  Before you move, I suspect EATMEAT isn't suitable either!
@howardhlederer LOL, though I didnt find it too funny when Jen first read it outloud to me without spelling ILVTOFU.
After a little snack, through security (at the gate in Schiphol) and repacked my carryon.  Waiting for boarding. http://twitpic.com/3e9ym
23 minutes, door to check in counter!  Bought a case of stroopwafelen, oh no, I think I bought siroopwafelen by mistake!  Are they the same?
Time to head to Amsterdam airport for my flights back to Vegas.
@braveyoyo My flight leaves in about 11 hours.  My JFK-Vegas leg is supposed to have WiFi, so I can twitter from the air, while I play FTP.
Here's a picture I took a couple of days ago.  Nope, it's not a strange blue cat! http://twitpic.com/3dk7j
Time to pack for my flight back from Amsterdam... well, at least time to twitter about packing.  I'll probably wait until 3 hours b4 flight
I've become addicted to stroopwafels.  I'm lucky -- there are far worse things to get addicted to in Amsterdam! http://twitpic.com/3b5hv
I haven't done a twitter post yet, so here's a "tweet" pic from Haarlem yesterday. Heading out now to buy food etc. http://twitpic.com/3b24n
@ronreddog @Crispy_Lanetta I'll join you in a low limit game if you want.  I was going to play Matusow some HORSE, but still waiting for him
Going to play some poker on Full Tilt.
Taxi! http://twitpic.com/39naz
Just finished final day of sightseeing in Netherlands with family.  A short trip to the original Haarlem.
someone go start following @jencreason so she can get to 100 followers and go to sleep happy!
Big fan of Kevin Smith... RT @ThatKevinSmith: @Andy_Bloch: Praise indeed, sir. Played a 33, then a 55, then 110, where I took it down
Played a few sngs on FTP... busted @ThatKevinSmith in the first one (I think he won another he played -- seems to be a decent player)
Going to play some poker on Full Tilt, but probably not a tournament since I don't know how long I'll be awake. SNG anyone?
@jencreason I think he was asking you if you liked his "eggs" when we walked by him at the tram stop
@RealAnnieDuke  Yes, feathers not snow!  Close-up view of the pillowfight action: http://twitpic.com/37sw2
Pillowfight on Dam square (last Saturday) http://twitpic.com/37pkc
@ThatKevinSmith I feel like playing too.  What do you want to play on Full Tilt?  I just looked for you but you're not there.
@tomvds  Holland has been fun, spending time with @jencreason who is taking a class at VU.  I'm heading back to Vegas soon for WPT champ
By the way, the statues of Goliath, David, and his bearer is from 1650

@jencreason  you're just starting a new fashion trend with the woman who wore her tights backwards ;)
@pennjillette there's a special Vermeer exhibition right now at the Rijksmuseum here in Amsterdam!
@jencreason is such a twitaholic- she brought her iphone charger with her to the restaurant.  She's tweetless while it charges
@sebastianrocks  fish, of course!  The best dish was a seaweed salad with crayfish etc.  I would go back to Lucius just for that.  lucius.nl
@jencreason reminds me of a joke I used to retell about how to catch a pink elephant. I think she wants to be spanked until she turns blue.
Dinner at Visrestaurant Lucius (minus the nutaholic @jencreason) (via @Andy_Bloch) http://twitpic.com/2x6iy

Finally can sleep, JJ ran into AA.
Hurray, &gt;200 followers.  Now I can go to sleep, except I'm still doing well in a tournament on Full Tilt.
Email from a fan with a poker question: "Gotta stop mailing you now or the other guys that I stalk will become jealous otherwise :)"
Playing online poker right now, haven't played much poker lately other than a few charity tournaments!
I guess twitter is running on [insert your favorite ethnic or other group] time.
Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under:  #poker #vegas #celebrity
We should bet on it!
Who gets the last twitter in before the outage?
"Twitter will be down for 1 hour of planned maintenance at 10a PST on April 5."  That's a bad time for twitter to be down!
@jencreason http://twitpic.com/2tkj9 - You know the food has to be good if they let you watch this closely + you don't have to worry abo ...

It appears the air mattress works as Margot is still asleep on it 14 hours later!
@jencreason You're welcome.  Thanks for getting the sheets, etc.  How's the weather on the porch?
Heading to Perry (to get an air mattress I hope).
waking up almost when normal people here do.  Happy birthday bro!
@RealAnnieDuke Ruben in the Netherlands said thanks for the autographed DVD!
@EmilyJillette can I get a last longer bet on you v. Perry?
@LaceyJones next rebuy on me?
@jencreason You're supposed to riff, not rip, while playing bass!
has decided to give up poker and become a Samaritan, moving to Mount Gerizim this week in time for Passover.
@jencreason "Tiny calluses on my fingertips... " sounds like another good song lyric
just woke up.  My body doesn't know what time zone it's in.
@change100 Sounds like you use Bank of America?  Don't get me started on some of the problems I've had depositing checks there.
