Anyone here remember milkmen? Morning milk delivery? Glass bottles? We still had when I was very young, in Yonkers NY. Now living in DC, I've been trying Amazon food delivery. Milk included. No glass bottles but it takes me back.

Once again, @NPRMichel's fresh approach to a familar topic (opioid crisis this time) kept me sitting in my car long after I had parked to get out. One of the great interviewers, greater all the time.
so interesting to be in Democratic New York City as I moderate an Intelligence Squared debate on whether the Democrats need to swing left to win more elections. Last minute adjustments being made for sound and light. The live stream starts at 7pm. @IQ2US https://t.co/PalQkZCmLh

starting now: hosting @1a look at week's Global News. What now with North Korea, after the summit that wasn't? Also: tariffs, Europe's new internet laws, Ireland's abortion referendum and more. Helping make sense: @MoisesNaim @sbg1 @kcalamur Tweet us your ??s and !!s to @1A.
starting now: I'm hosting @1A, to Wrap-the-Week. Making sense of Russia investigation, Elon Musk fighting the press, the wave of women going into politics, Harvey turning himself in. Super guest analysts: @mkraju @LisaDNews and @JeffMason1. Tweet questions and comments to @1a
Starting now: I'm hosting @1a look at @DollarGeneral, a retail business changing the landscape and making a fortune. It owns more stores than Starbucks and its customers are mainly the poor. Joined by former CEO Cal Turner and @retailwizard.
starting now: living with MOUNTAINS THAT RUMBLE. I'm hosting @1A today, with experts from @USGSVolcanoes discussing the how, why and what-do-we-do of volcanoes. With update on Kilauea. https://t.co/9ryTW4eyqS
Hey all, I'm back hosting @1a for the next two days. Today we're  talking...volcanos. Which can also be spelled...volcanoes. A useful fact  to make your day. Many more on the show. Hope you can tune in (10AM  EST). https://t.co/R5pYJz0KpD

Has to be pointed out this report points to prevalence increase largely due to FINALLY identifying autism in communities of color where previously UNDERREPORTED. It's overdue catching up. Here's a short PBS story I did on that: https://t.co/t8YW7DSQki https://t.co/3yiVItkbvx

Starting now: bringing to daylight. I’m hosting this hour @1A. A look at America’s era of lynching. How the killers got away ... and how to remember the more than 4000 victims, one by one. w/ Sia Sanneh @eji_org @shirahdedman @hankwthomas Woody Beck

&gt;@AutisticNW gives a hell of a good talk! Was pleased to share stage with him at @AutismAwareAus inaugural speaker series. Hi Chris! https://t.co/xElNO6IKub
Thks John. You saw early too. But vindication on this comes with mixed feelings. We always considered the truth here regrettable, but knew it should not be explained away or dressed up to look nice. Also we critically believe Asperger's record in no way reflects on ppl diagnosed. https://t.co/OoQ7XHKuZ8
The essence of Herwig Czech's research showing Hans #Asperger's complicity in Nazi crimes was publicly searchable in 2014, as covered in our 2016 book "In A Different Key."  Yet denialists kept pushing myth of "hero" Asperger. This publication settles it. https://t.co/DMb7pomBsH
The essence of Herwig Czech's research showing Hans #Asperger's complicity in Nazi crimes was publicly searchable in 2014, as covered in our 2016 book "In A Different Key."  Yet myth of a "hero" Asperger persisted. This publication ends that for good. https://t.co/HkVd5AkTVz
end of a myth, that Han Asperger, for whom #Asperger's Syndrome was unfortunately named, was a hero risking self to save #autistic kids from Nazis. To contrary: "guilty of actively assisting the Nazis in their abhorrent eugenics and euthanasia policies." https://t.co/xZMKkhzKWR

@expensify when your system is struggling to complete tasks, as seems the case today, you need to post that up front at login, so users don't waste time seeking to locate the issue locally. Transparency is credibility.

@Moe_McMurray yes yes yes yes yes!  to this and any and all "mandatory" formulas! every story is different, and invites different approaches. Even calling all stories "stories" is a bit of a problem.
Starting now: #Healthcare’s last resort, at risk. Community Health Centers nationwide may have to close, hurting millions. Nobody thinks this is good… and yet. I’m hosting @1a w/ @HRSAgov @GWpublichealth @danhawkinsjr https://t.co/SNDUGJZIRV
Starting now: The #wall he promised. It’s looking more likely, with Dems dealing for #DACA. So, what's “wall reality”? What actually happens when the great divider goes up? I’m hosting @1a w/ @BorderReporter @kristaschlyer @priscilava  https://t.co/elGgmLFdPV

That might sound like it makes sense, if money were everyone's sole motivator. It's not. There are people who do believe in public service as a good in itself. I've known many, including from @StateDept https://t.co/UP7dL5kQfY

Congrats! https://t.co/JQL2CCXYmX

JFK assassination back in the news, and a small hurt wakes in my gut again, like it does every time. I know it's one of those tired "boomer" things, but something in America broke that day. I felt it as a kid. I felt it a coupla minutes ago.

@Lollardfish Don't even.
@GudwillOne @ABC yeah I'm pretty amazed.
With the #Alabama #GOP primary win by #RoyMoore, @ABC has  reposted my long ago reporting on a Moore-inspired story. I suspect my reporting style back then may seem a little old-fashioned these days. I'm good with that.  https://t.co/QydNcqt2Ft

so so true. he's one of today's better orators. https://t.co/YRJW1rcZn7
question for all. when #Comey admitted leaking (through a friend) to the press, did that enhance, or did it damage, his credibility?
"bombshell testimony" : a cliche @NPR used for today's testimony by Comey. And yet...can we give NPR a pass on this one?
#Comey: if the president taped me iit does not hurt my feelings. Release the tapes!
Comey: the Russian attack on election was real. "as unfake" as it gets. "No fuzz" on that.
Comey: "Lordy I hope there are tapes."
Comey, sharing devastating personal hunches about Trump's character. Practically EXPECTED he'd be slimed by White House.
Comey: Trump himself NOT under investigation
"those were lies"  Comey says it.
could the Comey moment tomorrow POSSIBLY prove anti-climactic?
thanks so much for being there, Tina. Was a really good debate and a great audience for it! @iq2us https://t.co/pOPCNShWFg

yeah, you nailed it https://t.co/ACkCYCnzPw
she must be wearing "trump-cancelling" headphones.
"such a nasty woman" What? huh? did that just happen?
he needs to make the anti-Obamacare case. he's asserting it, not proving it. #debate2016
lesson for future moderators: if they ask you to do the "town meeting", tale a pass, and ask for the double-podium job. #debate2016
good bit of oppo research...the anti-Reagan ad. is it factchecked? #debate2016
Wallace still doing a pretty darn good job making this work as a debate. #debate2016  He watched and learned.
HRC...nuanced answer on ISIS.
Oh jeez, that got really ugly. who remembers the question (put troops on the ground?) #debate2016
Chris was right to stop her.
now she's going ad hominem. the question is not, did DT support Iraq invasion, It's: do we put troops in now. #debate2016
the question: "will you put US troops" into the fight. Hillary answers. Now your turn, Mr Trump. And he answers with an attack on HRC.
she's nailed him on the "rigged" thing. #debate2016
was that a UFO??
just....dangerous.
@madhulikasikka pay for play issue
moderator IS biased. In the direction of getting his questions answered. #debate2016
she's again avoiding a question that she should answer. #debate2016
HRC blew it. She's facing a moderator who rejected the pivot, and she lost the mic to Trump. BIG mistake! #debate2016
Yes, Chris! insist on getting the question answered! #debate2016
Being proud of the foundation is a pivot. The ques is not about its achievements, It's about pay for play, #debate2016
this is so freakin' sleazy.
there is a part 2 to this "fitness to be president question". where is part 2?
he is going to say that "nobod respects women more than I do"
Rip Van Winkle, waking up tonight, watching this, might guess DT was out front.
waiting for the "Moderator-is-biased" whine. Just not sure yet which side will argue it. guesses? #debate2016 (I think CW is doing v well).
"You can't." And Alec Baldwin scribbles the words down in his notebook. #debate2016
okay he brought it back to the questoin. he's have been better off starting there,
okay. so it's Donald who blew off the question first. He's talking about Japan and Germany. Ques was: how will you plan create jobs?
let's remember the question: why will your plan create jobs. how soon before one of them pivots to Access Hollywood, emails etc #debate2016
"she's been proven to be a liar".   hearing these two put each other down is, once again, just sad and disheartening. #debate2016
again, endorsements are not evidence. #debate2016
this is now debate #1 redux. #debate2016
Donald totally took the bait on Putin.  Here he goes. #debate2016
why has Chris relinquished? #debate2016
ah damn...this has started to unravel. after such a good start. #debate2016
Now Trump is moderating. it's not his call to move onto Putin. Chris??? #debate2016
#antipivot #debate2016
Trump is right, It was a pivot.
she is changing the subject! Wallace needs to call her on it #debate2016 This is aobut the content, not where it came from.
Wallace interruption of HRC also entirely justified. #debate2016
Hillary going ad hominem again. It's not terribly impressive giving what Wallace is aiming for. #debate2016
Wallace: that was a justified interruption. #debate2016
"He choked." Ad hominem and irrelevant. And oh no he's taking the bait now! #debate2016
"why are you right and Mr Trump is wrong"  That is Wallace asking for  true case to me made, proof offered. #debate2016
political endorsements ("ICE endorsed me") are not evidence. #debate2016
phew! real clash of visions, values, their bottom lines. effective, telling. #debate2016
Wallace doing a superb job: pushing these candidates to establish what they stand for and...here's the biggie...WHY! #debate2016
Wallace!! great job! nail these questions down! #debate2016 So, he showed Trump not willing to ask question by giving him three chances.
wait! what's happening here?? SUBTANCE!! what are these strange lights going off in my voter's brain?!?! #debate2016
Trump's done some real studying, it seems? DC gun case a valid move.
both right now looking more at ease than in debates 1 and 2 #debate2016
Wallace...going deeper on the SCOTUS question. Like his instinct on this. #debate2016
neither going much past campaign ad depth in their answers. sigh.
"how should the constitution be interpreted?"  Trump makes it about himself already.
Hillary laying down a pretty clear and liberal SCOTUS line #debate2016 what about deeper part of question??
Chris Wallace asks a damn fine opening and quite DEBATABLE question!! Let's see what they do with it. #debate2016
chilly
"Well, Max....THIS IS IT! (Gene Wilder to Zero Mostel, "The Producers," as the curtain rose on their intended disaster). #debate2016

in this god awful nasty time...that last question was about the best way imaginable to end this. That guy will be on ALL the morning shows.
Trump...thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking

DT unraveling again now.
"tremendous hatred in her heart" that's just bad writing.
tantrum unimpressive.
yes yes @MarthaRaddatz . questions count. answers to questions needed.
actually, in terms of expectations, better than that. https://t.co/VZ0bUcPRSP
thank you @MarthaRaddatz , for holding the line.
Donald owns the tax write off. Best answer there is. Moots the point.
Trump actually finding his footing now.
HRC...VERY unimpressive on the two-faced question.
HRC changing the subject...moderaters should pull her back.
yes yes @MarthaRaddatz ... only insisting on questions asked being answered!
Anderson needs to assert those time restraints.
those people on stage will tell their grandchildren about what they were part of. it will probably be hard to get across what it was like.
don't debate with moderaters. rule one of how to win a debate.
go Anderson!
this is the first debate redux: no holds barred edition.
is that a bad mic, again????
oh jeez. threats.
the pity is what this is doing to the party of Lincoln.
as soon as DT mentions Blumenthal...no one knows what he's talking about. Which is a prob for him.
this has become a debate on the character of Donald Trump
and now he has @Qise
we are now in unchartered territory.
there it is: the nuclear option
martha! well done!

yup, it'll be a first. https://t.co/szmnlIgUSM
@realDonaldTrump tells WSJ "zero chance I'll quit" and he's getting "unbelievable" support. Hm. Perhaps exactly the right word?
Well,  at least it all shows we are still capable of being shocked by indecency.  I had started to doubt.
About to join the great @smerconish on @CNN to talk #debate reality as moderator of the @IQ2US debates,  where we've done more than 120.

Worth reading #debate take by @DLind but real issue is Elaine, Lester et al not given the tools to moderate well https://t.co/zNtuGJkY51
In a REAL debate, you don't get points for ducking strong challenges, which is the skill seen on display last night.
@SkylerWestby @IQ2US @Change no but that's a trade-off worth making
Prez "debates" are NO WIN for moderaters (&amp; voters) becuz format denies them tools they need. A better way: https://t.co/vA7B4RjH8f @iq2us
It was a draw at the @VPDebate .
This Faith portion of the evening is actually functioning well as a debate. True clash  of principles explained and defended
@shermanmj check us out: https://t.co/9upRof3tkA
@shermanmj then it sounds like we're in complete agreement!
Now Kaine is lawyer for the Clinton Foundation
@shermanmj my view, is that that is not true in a real debate. Which this is not. Real debate is building an argument.
Sometimes feels like Pence is addressing a jury on behalf of his client in a trial
Well said. https://t.co/cjNVHc9Gbv
Kane should know that repeating the same phrase over and over again is not debating
This Iran deal part actually constitutes the first moment of legitimate debate in this evening so far. And it is worth debating.
By the way, moderating well is hard.
How would those safe zones work? Yes. That's moderating in the moment.
Sorry, but these guys are dissing the moderator.
Elaine needs to stop this thing and explicitly lay down the law. Rather than put herself in the position of  butting  into their butting in.
Ugh this framing is maddening, with Kaine addressing outside edge of screen almost constantly. @VPDebate
Yes!! Elaine needs to keep pushing back like she just did, insisting on her questions being answered. Use the force!
Kaine quoting gospel of Trump. Pence doesn't have much to come back with.
Moderating well means listening hard to what's going on. And playing off of that.
Kaine winning this "insult driven" point. Pence miscalculated by relitigating it.
Ahhh. Pence takes the dare. He WANTS to debate the insult charge. @vpdebate
Ugh. That Kaine litany of Trump insults DEMANDED a turn to Pence for response. Not a new subject.
Elaine would do well to depart from using solely her scripted questions. Get into the moment. @vpdebate
Sortakindanonotreally... https://t.co/eddGuccHjb
First half hour goes to Pence.
Kaine's interruptions risk sounding petty, not strong. @vpdebate
Good move, Elaine. Insist on the question.
Elaine needs to find her power. And use it. @vpdebate
Question is about tax returns, Governor
Trillions?
Pence so much better at this than the guy he's carrying water for @vpdebate
Well...Maybe. https://t.co/ccQhvfliZG
Kaine would help himself by waiting his turn
Pence demeanor working better
Question is about hrc not trump.
So far, no debating happening in the @VPDebate

apparently controversial to rate @LesterHoltNBC moderation highly for first part of debate. Here's why I do:  https://t.co/vZncIZJq6Q @iq2us
@Atos_IUX @caren_zucker  it was a great conversation. @NeilMilliken is actually a spectacular interviewer. Fresh questions=fresh answers.
To review: 1st 1/3 of "debate" was pretty good debate. When LH began challenging it became an interview There's a diff #fixthedebates @iq2us
Something to like. A rapper/dad's verses about #autism awareness. and by "like" I mean you can LIKE this vid. A $50K grant at stake.

Loved when sharp-eyed sharp-witted @JohnAvlon used Harvey Keitel line discussing debate and then points out Keitel in our audience @IQ2US.
Once again, saw @MargaretHoover cut through noise at our @iq2us viewing party. Thanks for keeping it smart, Margaret.
@bish on that you may be right. But by comparison with their predecessors. Not a high bar, true.
as a debate, better than any since Kennedy-Nixon. Lester, but also Donald&amp;Hillary, get credit for that. they actually &amp; fully engaged.
@Vannasana @MaxBoot @IQ2US it was a vote by our audience, who gathered to watch the debate.
Yes. Agree that should have been called. https://t.co/OCdLFxK34X
Really thought it actually functioner well as a debate. However the Republican needed a little bit of reining in during the last 15 minutes https://t.co/QFt8IXkhxJ
Here's how many minds were changed by tonight's #debatenight  at our @iq2us viewing party. Please note: we were on #upperwestside Manhattan https://t.co/hR4x0w4Nst
Lester you have power! Use it!
Lester you have to enforce!
"I have a much better temperament that she does." Gets a huge laugh at the @iq2us viewing. https://t.co/dnuQjzIhLN
Lester needs to assert now. Not that it's easy
Yes. https://t.co/rdYzXn839E
The take on round two from our @IQ2US viewing party. https://t.co/H8d5kZwODl
Kaboom on birth certificate.
Proof that Lester Holt is moderating well is that debate working without a lot of interruption by him. Well crafted questions will do that.
Okay this tax thing is not a debate. It's an interview.
We've just seen the best 20 minutes of actual  debate in the last 50 years of presidential campaign history.
Well, if she set out to rattle him, that part of the plan is working.
Trump addressing Lester like Lester's his buddy.
This is an actual debate right now. Lester smart to let it happen
Trump bringing passion n
Hillary knows how's catnip works.
Yes, Lester! Insist inn the question.

Most storied #debates in U.S. history: Lincoln-Douglas.There was no moderator. They fact checked each other Over hours That was #realdebate.
I know that seems should be obvious. But would result fadt in moderator v candidate debate. There're better ways. https://t.co/yIe8ZSR1Uw
Journalists, I agree, in interview setting. Debate moderation, though, is another function. Moderators don't debate. https://t.co/Ehsf7RGg8R

Yes, totally!! The prez "debates" are not actually debates. That is source of their frequent failure. https://t.co/fnFink7qqX
That, I think, confuses moderators with interviewers. The latter, yes, I agree, should challenge. https://t.co/br40oFFmrV

@SmileyAutistic nice twitter-meeting you, Samantha. Heard you.
.@EdNavigation @NewsHour @caren_zucker @ResnikDenise @SARRC_tweet Same to you, Debra. #NewsHourChats
@PrivatePyle99 @caren_zucker @johndonvan @resnikdenise @SARRC_tweet  Same to you, Dave!
Thanks to @Newshour and all who share in this convo. #NewsHourChats
I completely agree with @Caren_Zucker! #NewsHourChats https://t.co/WyRUBFaV5m
A8: What @TannersDad said. #NewsHourChats https://t.co/JVPlTAiogf
A8: outside of few programs like @SARRC_tweet &amp; @QSAC unfortunately not a lot in place for adults. It's the next campaign @NewsHourChats
A7: Independence in fact "depends" ... it's person to person.Again, it's everyone else that needs to do some adapting. #NewsHourChats.
Thanks, Ilana. Like our book, the work is in partnership with @Caren_Zucker, co-author, producer and #autism mom. Credit due! #NewsHourChats
Exacty how see see it, too. Community needs to adapt. #NewsHourChats  https://t.co/XGg4Vmycgk
That is a pretty cool idea. The sort of partnership we see with @SARRC_tweet in AZ. #NewsHourChats  https://t.co/5taRR9BuBV
.@milguy23 .@NewsHour Both, online and in 3-D, but the 3-D one is critical and harder, and perhaps most important. #NewsHourChats
A5: Communities can switch from seeing autistic people as "them" to seeing autistic people as part of "us" #NewsHourChats
@milguy23 as of 2013, the DSM groups everyone with autistic traits under ASD. Autistic Spectrum Disorder
Great piece by @Spectrum #NewsHourChats. All should read. https://t.co/EiaE4qSai5
@milguy23 @SmileyAutistic  Totally! #NewsHourChats We are seeing that in Phoenix thks to @SARRC_tweet
A4: Autism defies 1-size-fits-all. Communities represent richness of life, of experience, solutions. Friendship critical. #NewsHourChats
Important example in how @SARRC_tweet is getting private sector support #NewsHourChats
as @SmileyAutistic says "employers need 2b open to us" This is critical #NewsHourChats
A3: The biggest parent concern I have heard reporting for 16 years is: "What happens to my child when I die." #NewsHourChats
@SmileyAutistic I second that, Samantha! Excellent point #NewsHourChats
@milguy23 Exactly! Well said @newshourchats
A2: 2/2  They forget that kids grow up. And maybe aren't "cute" anymore. And support dwindles. #NewsHourChats
A2: 1/2 The general public/media can get stuck thinking #autism is a childhood issue. #NewsHourChats
A1: For starters, failure to recognize adults are not just "big kids". Ambitions/needs are not those of childhood. #NewsHourChats
Thanks for asking us on. @Newshour #NewsHourChats

HRC grew about 10 feet in the last hour.
She's hit her groove.
Oh now she's playing the I-actually-have-a-program card.
He's been a class act this week, but this moment has to be hard for Bernie.
"Every kid with a disability has a right to go to school"... it was once a radical thought
all very impressive tonight, but don't forget, Trump has Chris Christie.
I have to respect how @realJeffreyLord, outnumbered, is game for the conversation. And never loses his cool.

Hilarious that crew on @nprpolitics podcast had to look up meaning of "malarkey," while I was looking up "normcore." #generationaldictionary
Speech veering toward greatness in latter third.
Brilliant how the Dems have flipped  tension with Bernie into an source of emotions energy. #DemsInPhilly of course, the apology helped too.
"We don't look to be ruled." What a line!! #DemsInPhilly
Philly so unlike last week's descent too Hades. #DemsInPhilly
@tmwinsett Michelle O hit the mark.
A lot of these Dem speakers need to learn from George Castanza and do their "I'm out of here" sooner. #DemsInPhilly
Okay...time too wrap up.
All we wanna be.
Biden struck another blow against "fear itself" #DemsInPhilly

@MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump  problem is Max that several of them dialed it back once "presumptive" happened
Did he change minds tonight? Win the undecided?
And up in the rafters, the balloons wait for the fall.
Jeez it's ALL brimstone. Where's the uplift?
"I alone."
"I am your voice"... the pivot to the positive finally?
So far, Donald Downer. #RNCinCLE
The speechwriters not using many of those "huuuge" and "amaaaazing" and "bigly" words.
So different when he reads the speech.
Best candidate offspring campaigner ever?
@Moe_McMurray yeah she is.
Hm. A self-giggler. But soooo poised.

Wow Cruz subtlely sticking it to the nominee.
Cruz came in with well constructed speech. First one about ideas.

@TammyKoerner tbanks Tammy. I had honestly never heard of Oswald before this.
@ShelbyTMitchell @CrownPublishing  thanks for that, Shelby. Hope you enjoy the book!
hey @caren_zucker, fellow author,  looks like you and @SarahAU104 have some #autism mom experience in common https://t.co/BE63f9cWVy

Chap 1 of my new #autism book #InADifferentKey just became downloadable-and FREE! Check it! https://t.co/zetCjINlVx https://t.co/z26PB9dYzh
last night, @iq2us showed it could turn even a debate about "quantitative easing" into a nail-biter. it's what we do! audience left abuzz!
@microbear1 thanks for this Paul.
@kkaplan Keith the right column was clipped, but the story till then fascinating.
@kkaplan @PeteDominick thanks for this Keith. I wonder how dominant the view was-but still-consider me schooled. appreciate ur flagging this

@AlvinsMom cut class! (no, not really).
looking forward to meeting legendary Newton Minnow at tonight's @IQ@US debate in Chicago. Taking in criminal justice system: role of DAs.
@tmwinsett missed it, but thanks for the heads up
actually, it can get pretty heated, even while shedding light. take a look @ some of our @iq2us debates #decision https://t.co/q2hXkhlteS
historically, though, @NeilMilliken, the distinction has sometimes been narrow. "squeaky wheel" and all that. https://t.co/AuaTD75GcF
I am of same mind, Tina. One moderator, one topic, real #debate https://t.co/5TEQXiJcTQ
@AvBronstein  would hope we have candidates who are brave enough to take the risk
@Fireflymaker disagree. The problem is the rules. They should be laid down for and followed by the moderators and the debaters alike
@tmwinsett I would have to say it was Martha Raddatz doing the vice presidential debate as moderator in 2012
we will get there.... and with whole @iq2us team, eventually @joeobie
There is a better way to run presidential debates. Actually, there are several. https://t.co/7BTAhgtkov via @voxdotcom
Our @iq2us debate in DC on ethics of "smart" drugs starting soon. I am sure the ladder will be gone. Pretty sure. https://t.co/QR2Sg4DNiE

@Neuro_Skeptic ah....spoilsport!
@kasshiff @msf Nightmare story. Will want to hear this show.
@nprscottsimon @Cubs Yeah but what do you REALLY think?
Thanks @MEHEP4U @ABC @caren_zucker  (who produced) and I wanted to be clear there are no "miracles" involved. it's #autism.
folks, @autismfather has this right. there's such a thing as leaping to the wrong conclusion. let's not do that. https://t.co/MzSln1rJL8
well you are truly a big part of the modern day #autism story, @alexplank ! (starting around page 497 or so!)

@NeilMilliken @kurtyaeger This was a great chat. Highly recommend.
@CaptainAsperger exactly right, Captain!
@AutismRealityNB leaving us where in understanding? daunting thought.
Good point @AutismSocietySD We all represent one wrinkle or another in the fabric of humanity, whether w/ #autism or some other difference
@Learn_Autism this could make a great TV piece!

Interesting. Visual learning idea in #autism has held sway since late 1960s. http://t.co/vtInjQ83p8 @AutismDNews
@EdNavigation have struggled on this one, seriously. disability is relevant. and a child's confidence: it's fragile, I have learned.
@EdNavigation That would be the next thing I would say: that the balance is very tricky to find.

@1DeLorenzi That's a pretty ingenious improvisation on YOUR part!
@1DeLorenzi I am guessing you know about Temple Grandin and the squeeze machine. I just finished writing about that for my book-to-be.
@1DeLorenzi Is it short term wear? or pretty much all day?
@NeilMilliken if you are interested there is a shorter podcast version via IQ2 US app in apple and google play stores. liked the Yaeger.

I am asking myself: which candidate do I keep forgetting is there?
a few of these candidates are giving indications of being too intelligent for this format. but for others? seems its no problem.
Rand Paul....well constructed! and on the fly!
oooh... will never never never happen! https://t.co/eNS2qdTklh
so where is the part where the "debaters" actually...um...debate? #debate or #nondebate
whoa. I take it back! Trump actually answered the question!
these "debaters" already completely ignoring the questions, taking them as prompts to spill their scripts.
My God that was awkward!
well said. https://t.co/VdFx6MXrdc
No question. A seven sided debate (not to mention 10 sided) is just about impossible 2 make real. as in, REAL debate #debate or #nondebate

25% done. and we've learned WHAT about the men and woman who want to lead...? #debate or #nondebate
so now the debate is: Why "Me" and NOT Donald Trump. #debate or #nondebate
dueling job interviews. that's all this is. #debate or #nondebate
exactly WHAT is being "debated" here? #debate or #nondebate
this reminds me of the beauty contest question portion. #debate or #nondebate

phew, those pundits! we're in this everything- Obama-did-was-right &amp; everything Romney- did-wrong-phase. Few %points &amp; Romney'd b a genius
regardless, when one of these guys loses, I honor the effort it takes to do the concession. They give all, &amp; then some.  Not a snark time.
update RT @BillWeirABC: Check that...Romney will concede at 12:55 EST.
what's significance of Romney not conceding yet? thoughts?
Fox coverage feels like a wake.
I hate when TV news turns to that "what they're saying about this on twitter" moment.  It never translates. Like dancing about architecture.

very weird coup internal spat thing happening on @foxnews right now. their editorial house divided.

But @SrWoolford, @Joshua_Wolinsky 's ques is why working/making is tax incentivized LESS than buying/selling, no? ie why rate is NOT equal?
As if. @Joshua_Wolinsky
used 2 think @petedominick was estimable; turns out 2b TOTALLY inestimable Therefore excited 2b on his @sirius show in 15mins talking @iq2us
how  about if it's put this way: should work/making stuff be tax incentivized more than buying and selling it @Joshua_Wolinsky
But would you get the argument back that the guy who owns the mill is also manufacturing? AND a cap gains beneficiary? @Joshua_Wolinsky
Dan yes great. Some version of yr point will get touched on. If not by the debaters, than by me. thanks. @dnm54 @IQ2US
Joshua interesting ques. Can you hone it down a bit, taking into account skilled debaters can/will attack premises @Joshua_Wolinsky @IQ2US

this whole thing has to wear out the wives. maybe it's energizing? but I bet it's draining to watch your husband survive 90 mins of this.
I like Bob Schieffer's mom's line. Corny yet real and true.
son of Detroit meets the brother from Chicago
this seems pretty fact-checkable.
dance man dance
True, it seems .RT @E3Photog: @JohnDonvan @MaxBoot right, but it has demonstrated that R knows far more about FP than O did 4 years ago.
Bottom line, right, Max. RT @MaxBoot: This debate isn't going to change the trajectory of the race. #debates
LOL RT @caroljoynt: Schieffer and Lehrer not up to it. Managing men in debate heat is clearly a woman skill.  We do it all the time. #debate
but what is your view of droning?
uh oh.
Best idea yet: RT @Chris_Moody: Instead of a formal debate, I wish Obama and Romney had just agreed to play Risk. #debate
yes! Schieffer takes it back.
this is a C- as a debate.
uh oh. second time O said "all over the map." it's losing the fresh spontaneous thing.
does Romney know Obama's israel tour was BEFORE his election?
mano-a-mano on the apology tour.  "the Israelis noticed." they were verklempt, in fact.
Obama taking the bait.
the truth is these two guys would run foreign policy pretty much identically.  except, of course, apology tours would be out for one of them
whoa! discuss:  RT @MimiTorch: No more male moderators! They have no balls and let Romney do whatever he likes.
Good question. Let's see how it become a health care discussion
Bob Schieffer: where are you?
the ayatollahs are asking each other: "what is this Massachusetts?"
let's debate this: RT @gothamson1: @JohnDonvan John your stupid...
they just don't know how to do it.
Schieffer will sound silly going from small business to Iran nukes.
hilarious! Obama taking the bait,.
small businesses? oh, Britian, a nation of shopkeepers
teachers unions??? what, is he talking about Poland?
Schieffer needs to stop these diversions.
jobs at home is not the issue tonight.
gotta luv wonks! RT @DelMarinDC: @JohnDonvan And this is the debate I've been waiting for #foreignpolicyjunkie/stayathomemom
"when people vote, they vote for peace.." um, Serbia? um, Weimar Germany, um....
We have binders of allies, no?
aaah...the shift to economy!  call it Schieffer! off topic
well, itRT @spicyandlove: @JohnDonvan there's a world outside America?!
just thinking how boring this must be 2 the world of lib/con political junkies who don't give a cr*p about foreign policy or world out there
Interesting. Obama's having BEEN making policy &amp; it shows. But neither is Romney sounding even slightly clueless.
Looks like the president has been studying tape of his first debate. Don't think he's blinking, even.
argh! took the word out of my mouth! RT @PeterBeinart: Romney hasn't mentioned Israel yet! Doesn't feel it in his kishkes
tough question coming, syria,. hang on.
"heres one thing In learned as commander in chief." hm.  only one guy ever gets to use THAT line.
Candy Crowley trying to break in through the doors in back of the hall

I just can't believe reporters actually walk into a place called the "spin alley." walk toward the light, guys!
ahhh! I owe payout to LOTS of you on 47 percent!!
how is this Obama's answer to mispercptions of him:?
I will say it again. Time for a real debate. This has not been that.  What was learned?
still taking wagers....will we hear 47 percent? I say no.
Candy being TOO polite. they're wandering way off the questions.
Yes Candy putting it in a nutshell. thanks.

yeah right? RT @BillWeirABC: My kingdom for a straight answer to a direct question. This is exhausting. #debate
Romney boiled down: Obama years were a bummer. Obama boiled down: Next 4 will be bummer-er if Romney's elected.
yeah but timing's everything RT @JoshuaGreen If this Obama showed up 1st debate, Romney wud be written off &amp; press wud be focused on Senate.
ugh. this is a speech, not an answer/
A hundred morning show bookers ordering fruit baskets sent to home of Susan Katz right now.

Awww ya fahthah's moustache!  RT @IAmChrisFreeman: @JohnDonvan ...I know you are but what an I?...
okay, this is going in dumb circles:  "That ISN'T what I said!"  "Yes it is." "Uh uh"  "Did too..." and repeat.
this debate is not really shedding light on an awful lot of anything.
once every for years, power loves the middle class. then comes the in-between time.
wagers? will we hear the number 47 percent tonight?
President raring to go on this one.
Candy....handling it well.
the tone this is taking makes me doubt sincerity of that opening handshake
production is up. but it's down. and...and....
mano-a-mano!

yeah style counts, &amp; is fickle mistress MT @PeteDominick: Bidens laughs/disregard might put people off tho his stances  might get them a job
Okay folks. That was REAL debate.  We do that monthly: Intellience Squared US.  Next topic The Rich R Taxed Enough. @iq2us  listen then vote
Pete that's what we've been talking about. RT @PeteDominick: Substance mattered much more than style and that is good
"My friend." from now on, a go-to euphemism.
malarkey factor? RT @nprscottsimon: As someone who'se middle name is Sullivan, this Biden/Ryan debate reminds me of Chicago family dinners.

oh SO my kind of debate! RT @madhulikasikka: Hey @JohnDonvan your kind of debate
watch out on the jack kennedy!!!  nrisky!!
@martharaddatz needs to do a "specifics:" again.

is looking into the camera cheating? #debate
Yes!! RT @PeterBeinart: this debate is actually making me proud of american politics
wow...UI can hear seniors answering back all up and down the bloclk!
great that they can interrupt!

"you  own airplane and house and not facts" -- uh oh....ZIIIIIINGER. (scripted, right)
RT @JeffreyGoldberg: Obama's just not used to being challenged anymore. Should have hired Bibi Netanyahu to play Romney in debate prep.
I tend to agree RT @Slate: RT @mattyglesias: WHY DOES JIM LEHRER KEEP ASKING  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES? THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.
Ugh.  When Lehrer put role of govt quest to Obama, he shrunk it into a discussion of school funding and budgets.
Role of Govt Ques: THIS one, actually getting a real answer.  Romney. Let's see if Obama answers it too.
Jim. Just say "STOP TALKING." Two words. Use the force.
Romney rolling over Lehrer again.

@MnKarp  what can I say....
a,h...the Massachusettes jiu jitsu. response?
Got to hand it to Romney . He's a skilled debate moderator.
Only of these two men had an energy drink beforehand.
RT @Slate: RT @williamjdobson: Jim Lehrer has lost this debate.
Lehrer really needs to kick some debater butt.
The speaking time is about equal at this point, but I think Romney has got a LOT more words in.
Hey!! They're making eye contact! Breakthrough!
great tip. not one I can retweet as a lifetime ABCer (oops) @MargaretHoover @CNN
am I wrong...but has Romney had more actual airtime so far?
again...Romney running the rules. the timing. Ignoring Lehrer and Lehrer letting him.
Jim is struggling to shape this thing but Romney is running it.
