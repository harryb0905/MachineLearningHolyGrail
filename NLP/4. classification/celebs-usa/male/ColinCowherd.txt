@GoodIdeasCost How it feels to me too.
What exactly is this Lakers team? https://t.co/mQ2IB3qoLb
I think Lebron James cape has a tear in it. #Supermeh
@cusefan33 Agree.   Can’t figure it what offense they’re running.
Rondo still can’t consistently hit an open jumper. 15 feet out. All these years in the league.  #Lakers
@HunterMahan @GottliebShow I like BL.  Can’t figure out why he’s always moving around.

Hollywood can’t even get the obvious stuff right anymore.  #Oscars
@WKguy True
@CorymRichins 👍
@BeenThereSports @TheHerd @NBAHistory Been to about half.
@Mtmatt406 Yes.  Big Sky.
@_benjessee 💪stunning.
@itsjwills Pacers a third seed.  They will drop.  BOS or Philly take that spot.
Good year for snow. Good view for lunch.  #promontory https://t.co/LxCsmbIlI0
@chris_teez26 Good luck w that Toronto love. Such a rich history of playoff success. 😂
@GMH___3 ☝️
@vishinthesea They had two of the worlds best shooters.  (and absolutely the best) In an increasingly three ball reliant NBA. But keep trying.
@IKE_Bucks What’s laughable is anyone buying into reg season results.  TOR, DEN and MIL will be watching finals on TV. ( and in Bucks case, griping they didn’t get the calls v BOS or PHI and NBA is rigged against them and smaller markets).
@jespitz Good luck. 🙏🏼
@LoganNoffke_8 @onerealchris @IKE_Bucks So objective. 😂
@RobbyPav27 Yea. Actually do. It’s called NBA history.  It rarely fails.
@JenniferPawlak Who cares.  That’s my point.  Reg season borders on irrelevant.
@TonesZone Really? When has Toronto ever come up big?
@IkeQuartey1 @TheGreveTrain ☝️
@IkeQuartey1 One.  Which means no finals.   Dope.
@jarengoatjr Watch almost every night.  Just don’t get fooled on reg season.  Means very little.
@corkais608 Really. Did he not play last year.
@TroyMatte1 I do but HOU is very good.
@Wentland828 Ooohhh.  A regular season loss.  How will they recover.
@jarengoatjr Yawn.  NBA all about April and May and June.
One elite star is not getting a team out of either conference.   The East is legit now.  Philly is stacked. Boston is loaded.
@BBennett1992 One. Each team.  Good luck.
@exavierpope Yep. One star.  Good luck in the playoffs w one star.  That does not scream Finals.
MIL, TOR &amp; DEN are 3 classic NBA “regular season champs”.  Done nothing or disappointed in playoffs so play harder now.  Win on effort &amp; depth in reg season. But playoff BB is about elite players. Everyone, including stars, are locked in. Depth is less crucial as rotations shrink
@MurphTHEgreat1 Yes 💪

@byjoelanderson Me too.

@BigLance68 @ClayTravis The NFL is not against either of these leagues. It’s a different time.  February and March are wide open.
@ClayTravis One or both of these new football leagues will work.  Legalized sports gambling, legit upfront capital for both leagues and heavy network promotion will guarantee it.

@SInow @MLB Damn.
@geoffschwartz ☝️
@mcoxcm @FOXSports Never
Very rarely in any business, do you regret, years later, acquiring something elite. Generally you regret going cheap and settling. Great creates its own momentum. The Lakers, my hunch, will have AD very soon. And yes, they sold the farm to get him. You GULP early to win later.
Nobody knows the Pats like their former DC Eric Mangini. He broke down what he saw.  https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
@CharlesRobinson 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Tom Brady has won six Super Bowls.  He’s led a game winning drive in the fourth quarter or OT in every single one.  Cya in AM.
@blakeybop He was amazing last year and lost.  That’s football.
@ClayTravis @LockItInonFS1 😂
@puny_32 NBA Finals was a sweep.  World Series was a mismatch.  It happens.
Believe it or not, the Patriots will enjoy this Super Bowl, as much as the others.  They’re not seeking anyone’s approval or appreciation.
Gronk picked a good time to be Gronk.
Patriots DL has kicked ass tonight. Domination. Winning battles at every position.  On virtually every play.
Here come the Rams.
@CappsAllen Yea. Obvious. 😂
@BDanielson12 Ha. Good point
We’ve been spoiled.  So many great Super Bowls in recent years.  There was a long stretch of atrocious blowouts in successive years.  This game is close.  Inartistic but close.
@bykevinclark 😂
Really well done. https://t.co/V8fEippfRM
Most surprising part of first half ?  Rams OL getting pushed around. Pressure on every pass.  Losing several one on one battles. #lowscoring
Game comes down to two things for me.  1. Can Donald and Suh create real pressure. 2. Can Gurley be a real factor (18+ touches).  If the answer is YES to both, we have a great game and potential/probable upset.  But i don’t know the answer to either.  So I’ll take NE.
Rondo been great tonight v warriors.  Totally controlling the tempo. Several great feeds. Talking throughout. Really impressive.
@erikjnels7 @ladygaga I watch movie to be entertained.  Not for accuracy.  Hollywood is in the story telling business.

@IrishFootball19 Or perhaps : Memo to other NBA players. Avoid New Orleans.  This is how they act when things don’t go their way.

@ngslider @BruceFeldmanCFB Who gives a rip about last decade. I’m talking THIS specific kid w THIS specific Texas HC.
@ngslider @BruceFeldmanCFB Thanks for following and under TH, yes players did get better.  Georgia game perfect illustration.  Roster was still mostly non TH recruits.  Dominated bulldogs.
@BenAxelrod Seth is excellent.  Fans want to deny for obvious reasons.
@BruceFeldmanCFB Much better for him.  USC is a mess.  Texas would be a great fit.  Longhorn players actually get better under that staff.
That @SethWickersham article is well sourced despite what Browns fans want to admit. Exact things we’ve been saying for a year on our show. Ego everywhere in the building. The roster has talent and @bakermayfield can hopefully rise above it. But,,,lots of nonsense in the facility

@BillsMafiaEP @SDBillsBackers @RyanTalbotBills Yea 95 perc.  Absolutely.
@JonathonBormann @TheHerd Completely accurate
@BeckBrandonBeck @jimmyferlito @SDBillsBackers @RyanTalbotBills His two biggest games this year vs KC. Did you read my tweet. He isn’t a volume guy.  He’s a big game guy. Great vs Chiefs twice.  Great v Steelers. NE pays him for a reason.
@jimmyferlito @SDBillsBackers @RyanTalbotBills Set NE record w 180 receiving yards vs Steele’s in playoffs.  A NE record.  Yea just ok.
@Bluejaysfan10 @RyanTalbotBills @SDBillsBackers It is true.  BestCB in afc east was a Bill. Let him go to rival. Idiotic.  BillsWR group is awful. Had Hogan. Let’s him go. Idiotic.  That’s called manipulation.
@Bluejaysfan10 @RyanTalbotBills @SDBillsBackers Gilmore best DB for NE.  Hogan isnt a volume guy he’s a big catch in big game guy. Both have been strong pick ups. In division. BTW bills gave Ryan Fitzpatrick a contract after a big September win. Really going to argue they’re  well run ? They hired Rex Ryan. After fired in Div
@SDBillsBackers @RyanTalbotBills My bad.  Said trade. Talking about stealing a Chris Hogan who the bills had no idea how to use.  Goes to NE, and valuable as hell.
@Petermannnnn @stephenasmith Yea. Lazy.  That’s me.   Was talking about Chris Hogan Theft. Not a trade. My bad. They just took a really valuable player the bills had no idea how to use.

@JoeFortenbaugh ☝️
@AChicksPerspect @DanielPKearney @dave_patrick Egregious is irrelevant.  NFL doesn’t give you “extra” for egregious.  Never has.  Its about what is taken away on missed penalties.  Rams has first and goal from one, taken away. That equals points.  Not sure wh fans are caught up in egregious.  Whiff is a whiff.
@getnickwright @FTFonFS1 @Edelman11 Man, I slept well last night.  You?
@floplag KC defense sucked.  All game.  No excuse.
@cercilbog The. Jumped back on Friday.  Picked em to win at New Orleans.

@StefanComeaux30 👑👑👑
@Marcus_Ingram12 I don’t pick my favorite teams.  Fans do.
Patriots v Rams.  I’m not very religious but somebody is taking care of me. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
@mattlahourcade @jaymo65 @jeff_in_nola @DanielPKearney Games are not officiated perfectly. Chiefs fans, for instance, are asking the ref.  Yet Dee Ford cost you the game.  And not a peep.  He blew it. Game@was over.  Mental error lost KC the game.  Dude lined up offsides.  Worse error than any call.  Yet it’s refs fault
@jaymo65 @jeff_in_nola @DanielPKearney Fans are emotional.   They think an obvious blown call is somehow worse than a less obvious blown call.  Both are missed.  It’s what they result in that matters.   The face mask whiff guaranteed a first and goal for Rams yet is getting zero coverage.
@Matthew_Bowers_ @jeff_in_nola @DanielPKearney The point is this.  Doesn’t matter how dramatic a call is that’s missed.  It’s what the missed penalty results in.  Fans get caught up in “this call was REALLY blown” who cares. It’s what the result becomes that is taken away.
@AChicksPerspect @DanielPKearney @dave_patrick Doesn’t matter.  Would have given Rams first and goal from 1.  Egregious or not.
@jeff_in_nola @DanielPKearney Doesn’t matter.  Would still have been first and goal from 1.
@brandonsblog @rory_humphrey @DanielPKearney Exactly.

@davidpollack47 No. An awful defense that knew the rules and couldn’t make a stop nor apply even marginal pressure in OT os is why TB is headed to Atlanta.
@JoeyA_11 @GTizzleonthemic I know you do.  It’s the other guy.  Too funny
@JoeyA_11 @GTizzleonthemic Always the tough guys that are the biggest morons. Never fails.
@GTizzleonthemic @JoeyA_11 ☝️☝️☝️😂😂😂
@RealPaulCortese ☝️😂
@letsgobucstb Yep.  Great talent.
After that drive, I think it’s official. Tom Brady is a top ten QB ever. I mean EVER.  I’ll argue all day about it.
That is NOT a catch. Never had possession. Therefore ball can’t touch ground.  CBS analyst is right.
@garym02 Not at all.  Very good. One whiff.
@leonfl24 @_JFoote Lousy call.
@moondawg238 @_DaleCooperFBI They got the call right.  Cbs broadcasters were right.  They explained it perfectly.
@_DaleCooperFBI It can.  Allowed now.
@PennPerspective Uh yea. That’s not even the tough part.
This is a catch. CBS analyst has it right.  It CAN touch ground.  He never lost possession. That’s the new rule.
If refs don’t SEE something, don’t call something.  Not tough. Really isn’t.
@ATLBeatBlog Yep.
@Wolfdogggg 😂
@Tubber_Lang ☝️😂
I don’t see the touch.  Although on Twitter I’m sure EVERYONE is absolutely sure a patriot touched the ball.  👌
@ctreigns @cMCtheGoat @MarcusFahey Right?  Remarkable how many fans don’t get basic sports gambling.
@mobilehagadone @cMCtheGoat @MarcusFahey Yes. It would.  You bet NUMBERS not teams or players.  That’s sports gambling 101.
@cMCtheGoat @MarcusFahey It is my favorite BET. TBrady is my favorite player.  This is difficult to decipher ?everyone knows I love TB.  But I don’t always bet him.  That would be foolish.
@njadams91 Won SU and ATS. 💰. I’m good.
@chancedep Nah. Change based on info. Always.  How I live my life.  Never stick to anything that isn’t working.
@jguest67 @fritdog23 😂
@cavs_fan2 Uh, ok. If that’s your conspiracy. Lawd.
@Maldo764 😌
@Pez420182 @Berrettaman28 Hurtful.  I’m crestfallen.
@DeionJulio @Berrettaman28 Love him.
@camcdonald2 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼 thanks for watching
@cavs_fan2 Saints are FAR more popular than Rams. Are you crazy.  Rams barely popular in LA.
@65SouthSports He’s always welcome back on my show.
@fritdog23 Yep.  And....I’m not allowed to tweet during the game?  All my tweets have to be pro Chiefs? 😂😂😂
@Berrettaman28 And yet picked them to win today.  Amazing how that works. You can like a team.  Not like em when they play like crap and then like em again when they adjust and improve. Wow. Cool.
If the Patriots AND the Rams get into the Super Bowl, I’m going to be unbearable 😂😂😂
@FJeezy_ Appreciate you listening 👊🏼
@MohamedSCIAhmed @layne_rhodes ☝️
@iruntheplace @OldTakesExposed @W_Lanier9 9-0 SU.  👊🏻
@Brandon1915 @NKlastava Just had my highest rated month.  And 331 million facebook views and 111 million podcast listensin 2018. We will be ok.  👌
@W_Lanier9 @OldTakesExposed So painful.  Hope I can recover 😂
@NKlastava It’s Twitter. You take it too seriously.
@YukonBastard So did saints measly 50 yards rushing.  And blown coverages.  And lousy third down conversion rate.
@es3_28 Not at all. He was overwhelmed. Second half he and Rams were much more dialed in.  Called adjustments.
Patriots completely unaffected by ‘crazy’ Arrowhead stadium crowd. Superdome, in earlier game, clearly louder and more disruptive.  As predicted.
The better team won.  To go to New Orleans. Get zip from Gurley. And still win.  Sorry but the Rams were superior.  BTW that’s 9-0 SU in the playoffs. You’re welcome. 💰
@LanceTHESPOKEN That’s loud? My living room is louder
@thebradshow2304 It was two hours ago.
@AndrewABC17 😂👊🏼
Anyone else hearing actual whistles in crowd?  Or just my TV ?
Pretty obvious to see—-Young QB is overwhelmed by the crowd and moment. Veteran, legendary QB is playing like it’s Thursday at practice. #NotRamTough
Rams look rattled.  Goff looks like, whatever the word for worse than rattled is.  #saintsrolling

@the_fake_danny Yep
@Johnny29709243 👊🏼
@LasaterAndrew Wow. Congrats. As a recent MVP, he hits FTs.  Amazing.
Lonzo Ball great in OT for the Lakers tonight. Westbrook a non factor in OT. Completely lost confidence in his jumper.  He was never a great shooter but it’s painful now.
@vnds_o Yep
@dvovalentine @Ross_Gasmer12 Lonzo foul on Westbrook.  Sell his too.
Here’s another idea for LeBron’s new teammate in LA next season...Kyrie https://t.co/UUGTcMnGIV

NFL playoff update: 8-0 SU. 6-1-1 ATS.   Cya in AM. @FS1
@kathy73460172 Why.  I took saints to win.  And eagles to cover.  Great day.
@noshortelectric @Chargers Picked the Rams to win. And cowboys to cover.  Not that complicated.
@Sidnickels Yea. I’m sure he’ll never play well again.  💩
@nickhawks411 NE was my lock.  All week.  Said it 1,247 times.
@nickhawks411 I’m 7-0 SU in playoffs.  5-1-1 ATS.  Dope.
@seaweed_actual @ArrowheadPride 😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@h2o5150 My SB pick for last couple weeks has been Saints/Chiefs. Yes.
@BuckyBrooks @Patriots ☝️
@JacksonChoat It’s not great.
@nolry0419 Which LA can use as a great motivational tool.  Perfect.
@jmacNcheesewiz Philly just lost their third lineman.  Working out perfectly for Rams.  Beat up Philly, sixth roadie in 7 weeks.
Two teams are loving this Saints meltdown.  The Eagles AND the Rams.  Huge break for LA, if Philly has to travel again, this time 3,000 miles west.  Would be 6th roadie in 7 weeks.
@kmbsdusa Mismatch so far.
The Chiefs have no idea what they’re about to face. https://t.co/TlpzXs8MtG
@cholland8 Picked NE and learn to spell.
@getnickwright Belichick is sort of good v young QBs.  Good luck. I will sleep like a 👶 this week.
@iSpeakComedy Yea. That’s it.  Not coaching or anything
@TDennisSportTog Defense certainly does.  But they will get it right.  And NE won’t be marching up/down field in second half.
Said all week, felt Patriots would be VERY good early in this game.  Felt they would be take advantage of road weary Chargers out of the gate w first series.  Think they will lead early and have to hold on for dear life.  But drive number one...was very predictable.
@geoffschwartz 😂
@Mando71323 Certainly possible. Great roster.
@MowDouble Uh, no.  Taking NE all week v LA C.  On tape a dozen times.
@rossi_jacob @Russells_blues Don’t trust ownership.   Still think Steelers and Ravens are@more reliable long term.
@Russells_blues Yep. Chiefs and Colts will be kicking major AFC butt next decade.
@richblove I was. 4-0 straight up.   3-0-1 ATS.  Dallas was a “push”.
@keepitr07289617 @DlopBeengone Yep.  26-23 Rams I think.
@DlopBeengone Yep.   That was the loss ATS.
@richblove That was the loss.  The push was Dallas last week.
NFL playoffs.  6-0 SU and 4-1-1 ATS.   Taking NE -4 and Philly +8 today.  🙏🏼
@D_melick88 @eboywaller Yea. Do that. 👊🏼. Talk golf too.

Sean McVay has been reinstated into the genius club. #LAStory
@concavecapital Cuz he’s a selfish CB.  His speed and talent are tremendous.  But he won’t play within a system.  Undisciplined player.
@jbutcher1212 I picked the Chiefs.  And said that.  Last two months played crap offenses elevated their D stats
@Aj_galler @byruus ☝️
Marcus Peters should be a one and done. Not a team guy. Andy Reid and Chris Peterson both bailed on him. Remarkable considering his incredible talent #LAStory
@geoffschwartz Not at all
@Ross_Gasmer12 @getnickwright ☝️👑
@getnickwright I guess winning your first home playoff game....this century, gets some people excited.
@Imanol_Tri MVP is a regular season award.
Said it this week ( picked KC) Indy is a better STORY than a team this year. Defense built its stats v weak offenses late in season.  They need two CB, edge rusher, more LB speed, dynamic number two WR and an upgrade at one of the OT spots. 9 draft picks will help
@JrGsxr1000 The league will survive without you and your four followers. 😂

@DougHaller Kirby smart did.  No question.  But Nick is brutal on coaches.  Been his rep for years.  Great w kids tough on assistants. And he’s struggling to get the next wave of great assistants.
Coaching under Saban is similar to Scientology.  Privacy is demanded. Verbal abuse is understood.  And when you leave, it’s more like “escaping”.  Saban-tology.  He simply wears coaches out. Why the turnover is so great. And it’s caught up to him. This Bama staff got worked.#dabo
@NJD107_ One of ????
@rharkins63 @DanWolken He’s got a terrible reputation.  Worst in the sport.  Saban looks the other way.
@DanWolken ☝️☝️Lupoi is a recruiter. Nothing more.  Every staff has a guy like that.  He’s a stiff, as an actual coach.
Not a fraud. #YabbaDabo https://t.co/dYZQRKjaOx
I found a very happy SEC fan @SportsPundette Go Vols https://t.co/DAiRMVR0Lw
Saban looks miserable.  Oh wait, he always does.
Bama’s kicker was the lead blocker on that play.  Against Clemson. Say that out loud.
@RaizesTradd @KriswithaK30 Actually contracts are set up to protect the business too.  I’ve signed 12.  Companies don’t pay you millions to be vulnerable. Not sure how many contracts you e signed but laughable to think a business signs them to protect just the employee.  Please. 😂
@michaelbird36 @VinnyBonsignore You don’t sign contracts on opinions.
@KriswithaK30 You don’t sign a contract to eat dinner.   So there’s that.
@VinnyBonsignore I’m totally within my right to do many things.  My tweet states clearly, I am old school.  Word is my word.  Kliff will be hired by Arizona, very soon.  Two sources told me today.  But if he bombs,,,USC move will turn some off later.  Not all but some
I’m old school. When you accepted a job at one place, and sign a contract, you don’t ask to interview at another place, two weeks later.  Crazy talk in 2019, I know.  I’m now just a typewriter and notepad living amongst all you MacBook Pros.

@kurt13warner @bakermayfield Liked him. Mature. Great size. Dad = NFL lineage. Big brain. Mature.  All business. No nonsense.  Mature.
For the record, I thought @bakermayfield had the best three pick, 23 of 42, losing effort, all season.
@geoffschwartz No
@dsquare77 Losers worry about stats.  Winners worry about,,,,wins. Crazy, right?
@vinceguerrieri @DougTurrington 😂😂
Pittsburgh needs the Colts and Titans to TIE tonight to make the playoffs.  Perfectly fitting for the dysfunctional Steelers.
@DougTurrington Um, you will finish in third place, chief.
Week 17 of the NFL and a Cleveland Browns game is crucial and captivating.  The NFL is king and it’s not close. 🤴
NFL referees: Let the play finish. Always. Do not blow it dead. Officiating 101.  Why does this remain an issue. #CleHosed
Several teams STILL reportedly after Jim Harbaugh.  Four of his players skipped bowl game to prepare for NFL. A trend that’s GROWING.  He has to consider that.
@ceb3_ Clemson beat OSU 31-0 last time they met.  Clemson beat ND 30-3.   Clemson would beat Michigan the same way.
@AntonioAquilino @FOXSports No.  I would be a terrible producer.  Tough job.

@jfkazar @OldTakesExposed I generally bet favorites in Coll FB.  Do pretty well.  But think picking NFL games is what majority of fans are interested in.
@dannylavo @TheAdamsEra Have tried.  Love his game.  Schedules haven’t worked out.
@TheAdamsEra 100 percent baller
Clemson comfortably.  I have already spent my winnings. 💰. @OldTakesExposed
Michigan will not find a better HC than Jim Harbaugh. They were 10-2 before today.  There are , however, geographic realities in college football.   Go to Rivals.  It’s right there.  It should be noted that these limitations don’t exist in the NFL.  Happy holidays. 🏈

The Ohio State (they love to say that) was destroyed by Purdue. THE game was THE reason they had no business being in THE playoff.
@mxk83 @KingJames Lots of people. The NBA is very popular.
Think it’s strange NBA is concerned about @KingJames comments on AD.  The NBA is star driven. They want us to talk/hype/argue/promote stars. Yet players can’t ? Feels like they’ve built up stars and suddenly owners are uncomfortable w the power and influence of those stars.

@geoffschwartz Exactly
Blazin 5 is done for year. 2nd best yr ever. 🔥🔥🔥.  I will post games I like next few weeks. First up,,,CLE +6.  Ravens off huge emotional win. Still a limited offense v talented Brown D.  Baker in a groove. Too many points in low scoring Balt win. Happy holidays 🏈

@c2thajay 10th.  Love his talent.  But he needs to, like all greats, add something  to his game every year.

@IndyBred317 Not in the league of these two athletically.  Please.  You know that. Everyone knows that.
The escapability of Wilson and Mahomes is all time stuff.  Both are ridiculously clever under pressure.  You have to be so nimble, not only physically, but mentally to pull this stuff off.
@KholderfHR Love em both.
Doug Baldwin may be one of the most underrated players in the NFL. If it’s close, he catches it.  Always.
@TheLancelotLink @Reflog_18 Yea.  Really hated that Lebron title w Cavs. 😂
@J_S_HERMAN @T_Dot_22 😂
@T_Dot_22 Yes.  Heated on your OWN sidelines is better than taunting an opponent. Crazy how that works.  SMH.
@delongbrian1 @TLClips So was Robert Griffin as a rookie QB. Remember?  He inherited much better talent than Andrew Luck. Then, over time, the maturity and talent of Luck prevailed.
@T_Dot_22 Brady didn’t taunt coaches then either.

@FlyerTom23 @bakermayfield Yea.  That’s it.
Patriots just clinched their 10th straight division title.  Browns fans talking trash and @bakermayfield taunting his former coach, for finishing in third place.  I mean....
@JSpangs44 And still won. What great teams do.
If only Andrew Luck threw more passes without looking at his WR.  That’s when Twitter will finally appreciate him. #MyColts
@jtanner79 Ha.  He’s been great too. You’re right.
@rfitzer42 @joelembiid_31 @RussWill5 @SDSantee2 @Sglieden21 @bakermayfield Your Cleveland self esteem is showing.
Baker Mayfield. Lamar Jackson. Sam Darnold. All great weekends. Never seen so many rookie QBs delivering at this level, so quickly.  Just fantastic news if you love the NFL.
@joelembiid_31 @RussWill5 @SDSantee2 @Sglieden21 @bakermayfield Did they have GM John Dorsey then?   Cuz he has quickly reshaped roster.  You can do that quickly in NFL.  Why it’s the best league.  Turnarounds are the norm.  Find a savvy GM and things get better fast.
@mcallisternj Badly.  Yes.
@damienwoody Yep. Pass rush gotten pretty strong lately too.
@DarnZingis @TLClips Good third WR.  Maybe second.
@cowlick100 @Sglieden21 I said, personally, I would not draft him as MY QB.  Prefer Darnold personality.  Less noise, more humility.  Never thought my opinion was that tough to decipher. Most people got it.
@RussWill5 @SDSantee2 @Sglieden21 @bakermayfield Believe it or not I actually talk to scouts and GMs. It’s my job. Cle roster is FULL OF TALENT.  Even saying that, Browns fans would implode 😂
@Sglieden21 I actually understand it.  Browns have been league joke for a decade.  Any success is going to be met w hysteria.  Baker will succeed, as I said 20x, but I still think I like other young QBs more.  Context is key. Baker has much better  support than Rosen, Allen and Darnold
@SDSantee2 @Sglieden21 @bakermayfield They will both wins lots of games. The league is better w QB stability.  Baker entered league w MUCH better support, that is called context, which of course is generally overlooked on Twitter.  By both are talented dudes
@kylenabecker The best OL guys are early in draft I wouldn’t trade down this year.  But your premise is one I usually believe in.
@kylenabecker Three good OTs in draft.  Several good WRs.   They need both.  Should be OK
@TLClips Yea.  He is a keeper.
Brilliant drive by Sam Darnold.  Jets have a great future if they can get him offensive weapons.  #Jets

@KnicksGuy1 @BrownsDynasty @thetruthlivez @dadalac @DarthZenos @nfldraftscout @Browns Bingo. You added context.  Short supply among the Twidiots
@lilkenchi Watched every snap. Be a fan boy. Doesn’t bother me.  But GMs around the league don’t watch games w Pom poms.  They think critically. Always seeking truth.  Not overvaluing QBs due to surrounding talent.  Pay Dak big bank—-Dallas will regret it.
Can you imagine if Dak didn’t have Zeke.  His limitations on full display today.
Cowboys/Colts is another “too many flags” game.  Becoming too common.
@Aaron12Rodgers1 You can’t even spell it right. 😂

@masanchez10 @PatDStat @TexansCap Switching topics. Fan boy ?
@masanchez10 @PatDStat @TexansCap Did you watch today?  Jets had eight  sacks.
@masanchez10 Texans OL is shit. They get docked significantly for that.  It’s worst OL in NFL. OL is arguably most crucial unit in football.
@masanchez10 No. They are not. Eagles roster is excellent.
@southpaw_75 @damienwoody No.  No pro bowlers on OL RB. WR CB TE. S. One great LB and QB.
@damienwoody Yep.  Easily.   IMO Best rosters...Chargers. Cowboys. Rams. Chiefs, Eagles (when healthy) Baltimore. Steelers. Saints. Texans. Patriots. Bears. Vikings. Browns. Broncos. Titans. Carolina
That @obj Nike commercial is LIT. 😂
@geoffschwartz Agree. Garbage call.
@KRNG_Chris @kellkill1 @JEdwar247 Yep
@Jm26Not Said darnolds floor was Bortles.  So what.  Floor means the worst possible scenario.
Yea baby. My man @PSchrags getting inside info. https://t.co/ktyyt4Yhhc
The Browns have a ton of excellent young players. But the self esteem of their fans is so low, after years of disappointment, even that compliment becomes “you just don’t want to give Baker credit” 😂😂. No. You just have a bunch of excellent, young players.
@DreKnott @ErikBurkhardt Good?  Uh, no.  Will set the ALL TIME record for sacks as rookie.  He’s a 10 year relentless, nightmare to block.  Smart, film junkie  w an incredible motor.
@JEdwar247 And is hurt. And is small forever. It’s 2018, I will always take an elite pass rusher.  Ward is special but I was lucky enough to be in the Chargers draft room when broncos drafted Chubb.  Audible groans. You don’t do that for CBs. Pass rushers physically hurt QBs.
@acnelson93 When healthy he is a talent. He is small though.  And hurt now.
@dannyfootball59 He’s hurt.  Again.
Bradley Chubb, a rookie CLE passed on, has a remarkable 12 sacks. A crazy number.  Khalil Mack, as a rookie, had four. Usually takes college pass rushers a while to make impact.  Chubb will set all time rookie record in next couple weeks. He’s also never hurt. College or NFL
@turnermaney 😂
I compared Baker to Case Keenum out of college. (Said repeatedly BM will be better version). Case is 21-10 in his last two years as a starter. You would think, by the reaction of many, he’s 10-21.  Vikings are much worse without him.  Broncos much better with him.  💪
@RRapier I wouldn’t have as GM.  Over 10 years he would wear me out.  I like quieter guys.  Brees. Luck. Wilson. Brady.  Montana. Aikman.  But as I said about, oh, two hundred times, he will succeed in NFL.  Too  accurate not to.
Great throw and catch. Bakers accuracy on deep balls is excellent.
@kjc__2 Picked browns to win.  Denver missing best Wr and CB. Browns defense will shut em down. Baker could be hurried a little. Browns missing a tackle.  But he will play well enough.
Better team won. NFL in great shape. Young, stud QBs everywhere. Baker up next.  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@MahomesFans @RealSkipBayless Also.  Game winning drive.
@MahomesFans @RealSkipBayless No chance. He’s been under pressure. Made some nice throws. Like him a lot
@USCTrojans55 😂
Darnold. Magic. Again.
@KoryAlwaysRight That’s how I feel.
@mn2fitness Baker has far more supporting talent.  An emerging star at RB and TE. Excellent WR in Landry.  Better OLine too.  Browns are a real team.  On both sides.
@armadilloreport Thank you.
Dropped pass.  On perfect throw. Forced to punt.  Darnold apperanrly needs to throw AND catch.  And kick PATs. 😛
Can’t help you if you don’t see Darnolds talent.
DeShaun Watson has no chance on some of his drives. Texans OL is being engulfed.
@Jthrush84 Ok playa
@advisor86 Jets will go heavy offensive in Draft and free agency. They have tons of cap space. He should be fine going forward w the right HC.
Excellent drive by Sam Darnold. Mobility was exceptional.
@zingisfromdeep Yes.  Just making the comparison.  Some teams are stacked.  Jets GM has whiffed on offensive side.
@zingisfromdeep Chargers have three star WRs.  Three legit RBs.  Multiple pass rushers.  Appear to have nailed their draft class.
After watching the absiurd depth of offensive talent for both the Chargers and Chiefs on Thursday night, the Jets look like a college team. Zero playmakers.  Is HC Todd Bowles to blame for that too?  This is not just about coaching.
Entering the season @PFF ranked the Jets OLine as 31st best. The Texans were 32nd.  So we are getting an all time match up here.
@E_Creator @TheHerd Or maybe get a first down or three on his final drive.  Instead three and out in biggest series of ten game.
@gordywobby 😂 4-6 w two road wins as starter w awful offensive personnel and a defensive HC about to get fired.  Yea, I think it’s time to call him a bust. 💪💪💪
I get to watch both Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield on a Saturday.  What a great early Christmas 🎁 present.

@J_Mizzle49 What would that salary be, playa 😂.
@SageRosenfels18 I loved John Jefferson.  😂
@WillManson3 Uh, your RBs aren’t even close. And sammy Watkins ?  Please.  Overrated.
@MJenoff @weIIspeak Exactly.
Chargers are simply a deeper and better team. Roster is sick.  How many teams have four legit WRs and three legit RBs. Plus two pass rushers.   They are stacked.
Weak PI call on Chiefs.  Come on.
Helmet to Helmet.  No call.  I mean....
@JLaugherty Fake news.  Ratings are up.  Nobody is turning off games due to it.  But it is bad.
Bad, bad night for the officials. Once again.

Baker Mayfield throws a better, more consistently accurate football, than Cam Newton.  And it’s not close.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.

Started watching every Patriots game 15 years ago when I moved to Connecticut.  Haven’t missed a game since.  The consistency is unreal but now expected. Every other team feels like a version of Bitcoin. You can have your drama. I’ll take boring and successful.
@CVegte24 Vikings fan.  😆
Fourth and eleven and Kirk Cousins couldn’t get rid of that ball fast enough.  30 Million for that.
Statistically speaking, the Vikings lead the league today, in arguing about pass interference calls that don’t exist.
@a_mooreman Success is never linear.  Successful people understand that.
Kirk Cousins never ceases to not amaze me.
@paternospalace Success is boring.  Find a product. Duplicate.  Wealth.

@dannykanell Like this.
Today at least, Tua is the second best QB on the field.
@AndreDa40643480 @KizK20 Tua is 3 x 10 in the half.  He is NOT playing well. At all.
@KizK20 Than a blocked kick ?  Uh, no. A block is a TD.
@mlrussell1093 @herm4418 But that doesn’t guarantee anything.  A block DOES.
@nobvek A block GUARANTEES points.  Good field position does not.
@illustrated_1 I’ll take Sabans
@herm4418 Saban is on the sidelines.  And agrees w me.
@ToddFuhrman Yep
@BraydenCollins1 Been to several.  Why I always say they feel like the SEC.
@DudeOkbro Perhaps but it still translates to greatness.
I think my favorite part of the SEC is the passion of the fans. Every crowd shot, people are hanging on EVERY play.  It just means more.  When fans care that much the stakes and standards are raised. Everyone is totally invested.
Sooners have played a mostly very strong second half. Beating a talented rival isn’t easy.  Feels and looks like a final four team to me.  Buckeyes need to be GREAT.
@detroitman606 @jasonrmcintyre Bama -21. Clemson - 81/2
Great throw and catch. Texas is going to be so good.  One more recruitng class and they’ll be off to the races.
This is not an impressive half by the Sooners. Texas looks like the better, more physical team.

Dak equals Tebow? The Friday Herd. https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
@WhitlockJason Excellent.
Get that contract ready for Dak.  https://t.co/IRRpgGzaCK
The Cowboys won tonight.  The LA Rams also won tonight.
@kodiak138 Underneath throws for four hours.  Yippee.
Dak is actually hurting the Cowboys tonight.  He’s a liability.  Seriously.  The way the defense is playing, Dallas should have put this game away an hour ago.
@dflowers2424 👏🏻👏🏻
@the_fake_danny Yes
Whether it’s play design or just QB reluctance, Dak just doesn’t look or throw downfield enough.  Too much ‘Dink and Dak’ tonight.
Randy Gregory.  I mean...can you cut a player in the third quarter?  Brutal.

Had a few USC fans come up to me today.  Told em all the same thing. If USC doesn’t at least pursue Kliff Kingsbury, they are out of their mind. Pay him whatever it takes. Make him interested. 💰💰💰offensive talent is NOT the issue at USC.  A smart, young coach is. #Kliffnotes

Give Andrew Luck just marginal support, just the league average, and he’s tearing it up.  I love watching the Colts. If there was a Colts channel, I would watch it all day and turn the Tom Brady channel off.
@Bchoranseahawk3 I agree.
@OGZaves Great future.  Need one more solid draft.

@OzoneMalone210 Yes they are. 👊🏼

Andrew Luck and TE Eric Ebron are in a crazy zone right now.  Incredible chemistry.
@p3pirate @DangeRussWilson Yes he is
Win or lose, very few QBs I love to watch more than @DangeRussWilson Just a baller.
Ray Liotta scares me, even during his Chantix commercials.
@insidetroy Can you imagine a movie studio “we realize there are problems w our actors, script, casting, directing and producing but we our not making any changes” 😂
@_joenick22_ @Schuy9 Yea cuz I never talked Cavs when Lebron was there.
@Schuy9 It’s Cleveland.  Let’s not get crazy.
@mullinsnova One play.  All half
@joshw1287 Every play. 💪
Hue Jackson and Todd Haley, offensive guys, got whacked and the Browns and @bakermayfield elevate immediately.  That’s not great for a coaches reputation.
Biggest game of the season for Aaron Rodgers #blazin5 https://t.co/XAUQLvN91I
@PePeDotMe Didn’t.
Notre Dame playing w absolutely NO energy tonight.  Tackling is horrible. No push up front, either line.
According to ABC announcers, Clay Helton is safe.  If safe now means top USC boosters have told Lynn Swann to fire him, then yes, he is safe.
@chrisfenlon_4 ☝️
@blake_kamms Errrrrrr😂
My four: Bama, Clemson, ND and Oklahoma.  (If they all close out w wins). What I’ve said for weeks.  Ohio state lost by 29 to Purdue.  No thanks.

Oklahoma wins 59-56 vs an excellent QB and experienced offensive minded HC.  They also had two key DEFENSIVE scores.  Sounds like the LA Rams over KC game.  Did we eliminate Rams from SB talk?  Yet Sooners don’t deserve shot at Bama?  Hmmmmm.

I’ve always felt watching Mitch Trubisky reminds me of @JimmyG_10 but there’s definitely some @DangeRussWilson in there too.
Kirk Cousins in another big, stand alone TV game. Three first downs in the first half. What does he make again?  😞
The Bears staff really plays to every Trubisky strength.  That’s NFL coaching at its best in 2018.  Always moving.  So smart and fun to watch.

UCLA is 113th in the nation defending the run. 11th in the Pac 12.  And the USC game plan today—-throw the deep ball often &amp; rely on a true freshman QB.
Michigan leads Indiana 22-17 in third quarter.  Six lead changes.  Yea, they match up well w Alabama.  #Oklahoma
Does USC practice during the week? Even their scoring drives are filled with mistakes.  Just a mess.

@Shanesydlew Has to be someone else’s fault.  Always is.
QBs Rodgers has wins against in 2018: Mitchell Trubisky, Josh Allen, CJ Beathard, Brock Osweiler  QBs Rodgers has losses against: Alex Smith, Mathew Stafford, Jared Goff, Tom Brady, Russell Wilson
@Dyingbreed_78 Refs agreed w me.
@TravChildress Yep.
Really bad throw by Aaron.  On a crucial play.  Can I say that?
Great drive by Russell Wilson.  He’s good too.  It’s OK to say that.
@awkramer3 What he’s paid to do.  33 Million a year.

Nice half by the Cowboys.  Clearly their problems aren’t on the defensive side of the ball.
Pete Carroll has amazing energy.  Love seeing people that LOVE what they do.   He is so into this. #hawks

@jaredawson11 SDSU
@jasonrmcintyre It’s incredible.   Doesn’t seem to even look downfield.
Driving for 36-23 lead, Andrew Luck throws perfect ball.  Young TE has it bounce off his pads instead of using actual HANDS.   Picked.  If they lose that’s the play.
Patriots OL is being manhandled by Titans front.  Even the GOAT needs help.
USC is a complete disaster since Sam Darnold left.  Jets, without Darnold, trail 31-0 AT HALF to awful Buffalo.  Believe what you want.
Not sure why I keep taking the points against the Saints.  Maybe I’ll learn by week 17.
Bills 17.  Jets 0.  NYJ outgained 186 to 1 in first quarter.  It’s not Sam Darnold folks.   Worst offensive talent in league.  Not even close.
@The_O14 Wow
@jamieisajew 💯

@justin_ablers Fifth best in east.   Like em though.
@DocKennedyLive Not at all.  Butler is scorer first.
IMO, the media has overvalued the West the last couple years.  Lots of dysfunction.   The East is now very strong at the top.  MIL, TOR,  BOS, PHI all loaded w top talent.  In the end, good for the league.
Butler, Simmons and Embid are big time talents.  No question.  I like the move. Aggressive.  But there are some feelings that could get bruised.  Egos here.  Can’t wait to see it unfold.

@PaddysPubTalk Hard to argue w you
@Lathum Good question.
How can anyone think that was a good spot?  Brutal. Not even arguable.
For the record, Sam Darnold has also been awful.  His accuracy has regressed.  Nothing to work with but...
Baker Mayfield just needs a new coach. Josh Rosen just needs a new OL. Lamar Jackson just needs an opportunity. Sam Darnold needs...everything.

@aBroham_lncoln Much easier w 3/4 recruits per year. Football you need 25 annually.  A colume sport w major injury component.
The fact Northwestern, a small, private, academic powerhouse, can be this feisty in football speaks volumes of HC Pat Fitzgerald.
Feel like I’m watching a replay of every Bama/LSU game the last eight years.
Bama dynasty has been almost flawless.  The special teams are the almost part.
Media members, more than a few, were still comparing Harbaugh to Brady Hoke in September.  😆
People may forget that as great as Saban has been at Bama, he lost to Louisiana Monroe year one.  Crushed by Utah in year two and had 3 losses in year four.  Jim Harbaugh is doing just fine.
@Neilioo @RealSkipBayless @ShannonSharpe @TonyDungy @tonyromo @PAOnTheMic @jbfan911 Never been an NFL talent IMO.  Small.  Ok athlete.  Average to below average accuracy.  Too many young guys out there w more to offer. Do like seeing him turn things around though. Don’t think he’s a bad guy.  Immature, yes. Hopefully like all of us, he grows

Wednesday Herd. https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW my guy @getnickwright  stopped by.
The NFL found a way to get even more interesting #tradedeadline https://t.co/NEV2j668b7
Looks like the Sixers are getting processed tonight. #WhosFaultzisit
Tuesday Herd.  @AlbertBreer talks NFL moves.  https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
Eagles. Rams. Redskins. Ravens.  All aggressive.  All got better. 💪. Packers apparently don’t need talented players.
15 minutes out @FS1 interesting Browns candidate update.  🏈
Gotta say, I actually felt bad for Baker Mayfield today https://t.co/nz7nzZ0fnj
Deeply disturbed with Patriots Red Zone offense. https://t.co/4MXxBrMRds
Former Packer @GregJennings doesn’t mince words today on Green Bay loss.  The Herd podcast.   https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
Wow. Todd Gurley. My new favorite NFL player. We over me guy.  #stud
@chasdunn Yea. Not great. 😵
Jaire Alexander is jaw dropping good for Green Bay. Seriously. Almost four hours of making plays all over the field.  Intimidated by nothing.
@SpinoIsReal Yes he has
@patricksauve13 @CBBHoops_DavidC ☝️bingo
Few saw it but Andrew Luck now has a healthy OLine and a decent running game.  He’s back. #colts
@ktsdaddy @CooperKupp He is very good.
@sirkrik Good eye
@Vito_Malacari I noticed that too. Good eye.
@detroitman606 Thanks. We’ve been on right side of every game. Packers clearly right side.
@BigJJCTX Thanks for following
TD Packers and the LA Coliseum explodes. 😎😎😎
Another former basketball player in NFL. See a trend here. TD Colts. https://t.co/Iiv2JKiXN5
@jimmyvegas337 @PFF Oh yea.  Packer fans are amazing.
@LuuukeSmith 😂
Steelers have had more penalties and mental errors in last five minutes than Patriots have had in a month.
Nice picture @mandophotos https://t.co/DP66gSkQZ3
The Jets have top two WR out today  due to injuries and just lost a RB for season.  And they had no offensive talent when the season STARTED.  Hey @PFF, Least available offensive talent in league today ? Darnold has no shot.
@Brad88ford Nope had bengals 💰
@DannyRajchel Have several TVs
Jamies Winston is in a class by himself when it comes to poor decisions.  I mean, borders on bizarre.  #twopicksnow
Shocker.  Lebron leaves and clown show begins. https://t.co/P5iEHjgdw3

@DanWolken I do. Mediocre and getting worse the last three years. Great creates clarity.   Nothing even resembling “very good” in this conference.
@ShaunDubb @Bama45242 Bot
@tzander 👊🏼
@auger_josh In that class.  Not joking.  Not even sure how he did it.
N’ Keal Harry is a WR for Arizona State.  He may have just made the best catch at ANY level of football I’ve ever seen. Seriously.
USC has become a warm weather version of Michigan in the final year of Brady Hoke. A nice guy coaching a great program, that is simply over his head.
@B_Money512 I bet numbers.  Not teams.
@Bubbaklear @TheHerd It’s the NFL.  Vikings blasted at home by Buffalo.   The point spreads tell you how even the league is.  Teams win or don’t.  Patriots are one play and one yard from two losses in last two weeks.
@ohiojoe22 @sullikevphoto Sure does.  Amazing.

@rbl_laker Ha
@southpaw89 @Mrad_Bcclelland Except Harden and CP3 wouldn’t be held out of lineup due to analytics.
Great throw by Bellinger.  So glad he could play tonight.
Mary Hart appears to be high. 😂
@ScottOGallagher Uh, no.  It does not.
@AmirYaqubie “Platoon splits”.  Enough said.

The Friday Herd.  One of my absolute favorites, former Bears &amp; Dolphins HC, Dave Wannstedt stopped in.  Plus the Blazin 5. https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
@thelylewilliam Took Packers
Sometimes my Blazin 5 is a little too hot.  This week, for example. https://t.co/5U8zB6VmKR
@brannon_besse @TheHerd Strongly considered
@geoffschwartz @FS1 Steele’s off bye.  Key.
One hour away.  Great show planned @FS1.  Blazin 5 🔥 off a 4-1 week.   Why Vegas has bailed on Baker. (They have). And why last night told us more about Paul George than Westbrook. Plus,,,why Gronkowski news is no longer news.
@detroitman606 Have looked great.
Steph Curry on Wednesday was historic. Russell Westbrook tonight...prehistoric 🦖😂 https://t.co/0tUgE9J2Oh

@dannyw96 Dodgers deserve to lose this series.  Red Sox just have better, more confident group.
@tonyjdai @RedSox @MLB @Dodgers @ESPNBoston @ESPNLosAngeles Of course. 162 games in 2018 is ludicrous.  No urgency.
@MarkHespen Saw that. 👊🏻
The Dodgers look....hot.
@chris_garner77 @TheHerd Paul has worked at EVERY stop. You just put too much weight on titles.  I get it.  Almost all fans do this.  But Eli can’t hold Marino’s jock.  And Bill Russell has 11 to MJs 6.
@ODowd13 Exactly.
The Dodgers look.....cold.
@DTaylor2MI Yea. You seem like a big hitter.
@chris_garner77 @TheHerd Yep.  And then Doc moves him out of town.  Rinse and repeat.   Six times.

@LivinqRICH_B @ZO2_ Agree. 👏🏻👏🏻
30 minutes out.  @FS1 can’t wait.  Amari Cooper trade from both sides.  Herd Hierarchy.  Why football coaches , more than other coaches, HAVE TO have a game plan at the podium.   @ZO2_ looks legit and why @AZCardinals need to make a deal.
@nickd702 👊🏼

Monday Herd.  Loved it.  https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
Hmmmmm.   If he catches 70 balls next four years,is it terrible move?   Have their DL/LB talent.  Good OL talent. Star RB.  A QB they say they like. https://t.co/IUO5ZRchzh
@Aj_AIlday Career 42 perc.   And that’s  WITH more layups than any player of his generation.
@BlakeClarensau For the record...2 TD. 0 INT today.
@BlakeClarensau Fan is short for fanatic. Tampa Bay defense is awful.
Blazin 5 delivered. Again.  Thx to Colts, Panthers and Washington.  Our only loss?  Don’t want to get into it. https://t.co/7JeBkqU1PZ
@SpinoIsReal @official__bh @BBB_Bailey @BlackWilHunting Yes he has.
Andrew Luck leads the NFL in TD passes w 20.  Absolutely remarkable considering his lack of weapons.
Brown fans have their Baker Mayfield tweets all set.  Just waiting to push send. 😂😂😂.
Impressive potential game winning drive by the Bucs Jameis Winston.  Little mobility, couple nice throws, managed clock well.  Of course, will probably be forgotten thanks to a.....kicker.
Great game and comeback by the Panthers and Cam. Wildly entertaining. @FOXSports. Ok, also our upset pick of the week, so there’s that too. 🏈🏈🏈
@mostainback @Panthers Watched every play
@jackburgess612 👊🏻
That “Sacksonville” thing didn’t have much staying power.  Saw that coming a mile away.  💪

@Zitro5150 Errrr
@barterkutton_ @bakermayfield Mommy 😆
@PSchrags 💪
Went to bed immediately after the game.  How was the “Brady is passing the torch to Mahomes” ceremony? Kept reading about it all week.  Didn’t see it during the game so I figured they held it afterwards.
That’s called being GRONKED
@originalman80 Breaking: Brady is still really good.
Cool angle by NBC on that return. 👍
I understand the fascination with Mahomes “out of pocket” wizardry but I’ll take Brady and the pocket excellence.  More dependable. More sustainable.
@PollyPomegrana1 @Browns Thanks for responding.  The irony is real. 👌
@Marty_McRhymes Still think Browns are very talented.  Will bounce back.  They were really flat.
Blazin 5 was an ugly 2-3.  (Late Denver TD saved further embarrassment) Also, I simply underestimated how great the Jets Sam Darnold is.  Won’t make that mistake again.
The Jags HAVE TO move off Blake Bortles.  You can’t keep selling him as “The Franchise QB” to that locker room. No Jags player believes it.  No coach for the Jags can truly believe that.
@coachtomp01 Luck needs help.  OT,RB,WR positions are well below average.
@DayDreamThis @amoser13 Spot on
“Sacksonville” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@villecards Nah.  He’s good.  Special.  And youngest of all the rookie QBs.  W very little talent around him
@foxholesports1 @bakermayfield Darnold was brilliant today.  I’m good.
They will make a documentary someday on this Bears/Dolphins game.  It was a beautiful mess.
The New York Giants front office didn’t think Sam Darnold was worth a top pick.  The Jets have now scored over 40 twice and over 30 three times in six games.  That’s w marginal offensive talent &amp; a defensive head coach.
@216Brian Playa.
@dangarza512 Clever.
@Jordan_4729 😂
Memo to Browns fans:  Sam Darnold just had a perfect TD pass dropped.  And,,,so what.  It happens to every QB.

@DallasL97 He is damn fun to watch.  No question.
@Wild_Bill_OU Clearly
@TheNbsEdition If Baker didn’t have four turnovers v Oakland they would have won too.   Can’t play that game.
Browns lead NFL in rushing.  Browns lead NFL in takeaways.  Yea, the QB with 3 TD  &amp; 3 INT is clearly leading them.  BTW Sam Darnold w 14 completions over 20 yards is really impressive.  Weak OL gives him little time.
@ChiefsKingdom4 @TheHerd 😂

Another winning week in Blazin 5. 🔥🔥🔥 Went heavy on Dogs (Arizona &amp; Vikings delivered) also went big on Jets and Sam Darnold.  Still rolling.  Have Washington and points tomorrow.  MNF. 💰💰💰
It’s become clear I had the wrong side in the Raiders game. #ouch
@damienwoody Ugh
@dk_beardown Not sure yet.   But I’m rolling it over.
Sam Darnold. Josh Allen. Baker Mayfield.  3-0 for rookie QBs. #Nostradamus

Gruden 0-4.  Baker 1-0.
For Pete’s sake. https://t.co/zeiO686NPB
Baker Mayfield w a pick six and a really  bad fumbled snap just now, deep in his territory. And....it’s ok.  Made enough good plays today...to justify his start.
@AwaisM Perfect so far.
@joelklatt Sorry. I was watching a replay of his pick six.  I missed it. 😂
@itsdanillo 😂
Due to intense staff pressure...put the Dolphins in Herd Hierarchy top ten. (Number 10) They will be removed this week and staff recommendations will no longer be accepted.  😵
The Lions deserve to lose for wearing those uniforms.
Can’t believe I’m this excited for a Browns game to begin #Blazin5 https://t.co/1PGsHFV0hr

All magic is just illusion. Including FitzMagic. 🏈
Trubisky looks MUCH more comfortable today.
Crazy. #osu
Best Notre Dame team I’ve seen in years. Very good up front defensively. Clobbering solid Stanford.
Buckeyes totally underwhelming tonight.  Shockingly average for two hours.  Need a big fourth quarter. https://t.co/qyDRMKiUzh
So Penn State decides to play defense tonight. This could be fun.  💪💪💪
@Footballdataman Agree. OLine is big disappointment.
Uh oh.  He’s in trouble again.  @FOXSports https://t.co/3gzeU4JPzK

@dbinkowski @MarkAGunnels @FOXSports Uh ratings thru the roof for politics Last two years.  People don’t escape.  They are attracted to the circus.  Always have. Always will be.  Why cars slow for crashes on freeway.
Blazin 5.  Now.  @FS1  best picks of the year.  Easily.   (Off a 4-1 week). 💰💰💰💰💰💰
Huge NFL TV rating last night on @FOXSports.  Overnight 10.8.  Incredible considering all the political networks had huge nights too.  Sorry Twitter, NFL still just fine.
Kirk Cousins. Almost good enough. Yet again https://t.co/wzos9gnPS9
Best system QB in NFL @FOXSports https://t.co/ipFtq8lX0x
This is probably the best NFL game of the year.  Crazy fun.  Two legit Super Bowl teams.  @FOXSports

@osu1forlife Huh.  Had Davis Shaw on.  First hour
@Bama45242 Coll FB has become very regional.  Too Bama dominated. Research is my bible.  Coll ratings down again this year.   Until west coast gets legitimate power ...has increasingly limited major market appeal.  NBA, again thru research, has huge major market appeal&amp; growing  Why? Stars

@b_maine24 Nope.  Predicted 9-7.   Said they “would pull back this year”
@iDovey_ 1-1 on season w Carolina.
Blazin 5 💰💰💰 delivers again.  Another winning week. Giants over Texans &amp; Washington over Green Bay in upsets. And Colts +6 to lose close.  You’re welcome. 💪 (have Seattle tonight)
@Jamboy22_ @Giants I took giants to win today,  champ.

Can’t remember when I had this much fun watching two below average teams.
@TheRealLogan97 @pappybirthday Just had a red zone pick..dropped
@pappybirthday Uh, no. They both look like rookies.
@Stephen_Candie Wouldn’t have. Bradly Chubb will be better.
@Mike_Fabian13 He’s had 14 snaps.  😂. Settle down champ.
@TheGOAT53217970 Very nice player
Two rookie QBs and both with VERY shaky protection.  Something big will happen.  #picksix

@WeDoThisSports1 @TheHerd @FS1 Interesting
@JohnMiddlekauff Yea.   No pop.  Feels tentative.  It’s early but he doesn’t feels comfortable.   Nice guy though.
The fact this game is even competitive is amazing.  @DangeRussWilson is under relentless pressure.  Seattle OL is completely overmatched.
@UncleRob816 His OL is garbage.  His WRs aren’t much better.  Plus—-defensive leaning HC.
Don’t Packer fans understand why QBs need to be protected? https://t.co/ADykR03uSP
@DerekBWebb @FOXSports @TheHerd But you can’t take one long pass away.  That sort of counts too.

@PackofPantherz @Panthers24_7 Watched every play.
@John_Inky And....the pick
Browns.  Cleveland.  Of course that just happened.  😆
Tremendous play design and execution by the Colts and Andrew Luck.   👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Really, REALLY bad Red Zone pick by Darnold. Ugly. No need to even make that throw.  Too amped up.
@jean17062849 Ha. Yea. Pretty accurate. 👊🏼
Both Josh Allen of the Bills and Sam Darnold for the Jets w impressive drives in the last 15 minutes.  Nice.
Crazy first half in Pittsburgh.  Just an absurd level of offensive talent between the Chiefs/Steelers. Wildly entertaining.
@jakestaton15 Slow.  Down.
@BearsEst1920 Cuz Trubisky is a marginal talent.  IMO. And I’m in the opinion business.  😆😆😆
@BearsEst1920 Predicted 18.   And 7-9 record.  Playa
@iv10188 @howaboutafresca 😆
@JoeyMo13 @TexasFootball I picked Texas.
@BWest1218 Predicted 18 of those.  And 7-9 record.
Great crew.  On NOW. https://t.co/McNJKHUGbv
Lane Kiffin took over a three win program. His team then won their conference and their bowl game in his first year at the program.  Lane Kiffin led 29-0 after the first quarter today.
Florida State and USC.  Any guesses why both are just awful despite five star recruits everywhere?  Coaching sort of matters.
@DontPlayParlays At TCU he’s perfect.  At Texas—maybe not.

@_THEREALKM_ Very mobile. Senses pressure. Good enough arm. Been impressive.  Not an easy offense. Matt Nagy Is a smart coach.  Challenges a QB.

@AlbertBreer They’ve stolen most of his career.
Once again, the Colts let down Andrew Luck. Someday he will get reasonable support.  Not today. #fumble
@SportsVix 😂
Being a Steelers fan has to be  an amazing roller coaster life.  Touchdown oh, no.  Penalty.  Touchdown. More penalties.  Touchdowns.  Exhausting. But...fun.
Brady is just toying w the Texans.  He’s at a different level.
Andrew Luck is smoking right now.  Of course he is. 💪
@PriscoCBS So ridiculous.  😆
@ScottyshSin @FOXSports I don’t even pay attention to that.  I care about football.
@insidetroy Ever notice OLineman just don’t get better.  That’s a coaching issue. Top recruits out of HS yet never reach their potential.
@ClayTravis Agree.   Had this argument last night w friends.  Just absurd.
@L_C_J_13 Huh?   I love Dak.  But his ceiling is lower.
Fox NFL Kickoff in 45 minutes.  @FOXSports https://t.co/foD0PzRLqe
USC offense: Virtually no motion. TEs and screens don’t exist.  Low percentage fade routes &amp; deep routes galore. OLineman never get better. Boring and predictable.  Sam Darnold covered up lots of coaching woes.
@ParkerMcLachlin @FOXSports @UCLA Absolutely.   Don’t lose hope. Will be fun.  Playing a bunch of kids now.  Give him two full classes.

Believe it or not @Nike actually does research.  They feel @Kaepernick7 is a global brand that transcends sports.  Polarization sells.  Does anyone even argue that in 2018?  For every person on my timeline that says “I’m done w Nike” someone else will rush to buy his stuff now.

@dtram90 Yea, no pressure in your first NFL job.  None. Zero. NFL owners are always reasonable.  😆 If you bomb—-no bigee.  😂 I mean how could there be any pressure in life, on someone getting your first major college job (Stanford) or first NFL gig.  I mean...👌
@ryenarussillo You are wrong, man.  You have to take that game and forget everything Harbaugh has done. Like the Super Bowl and three NFC championship games and Stanford and winning major Bowls at the Farm and championships in his first stops.  Signed, Twitter

@emil_harb Bears have been a mess for years. Aggressive can also be reckless. That alone doesn’t make me like someone. Smart and aggressive does.  His career will be defined by Trubisky.  It’s wait and see. Do like the defense though.   Can’t wait to watch it unfold.
Great players who are also great in the locker room are RARE.  Gruden is really rolling the dice.  That...or the Raiders have no money. (Seriously)

@LATimesfarmer Nice.
@MCFanSided @TheHerd But Harbaugh DID win in both.  Saban crushes in one.  The rest is just conjecture.  Plus winning 10 games (plus major bowls) at Stanford is being undersold.  The Farm is an academic powerhouse.  Many of the top HS players simply can’t qualify.  Not even Bill Walsh crushed there.
@MCFanSided @TheHerd The highest level of coaching is NFL. Not really even close.  Harbaugh was excellent. Saban bombed.
What a show. Former Steeler James Harrison kicked butt. Great insight. https://t.co/bCnBzD7UmW
@MCFanSided @TheHerd He was two time NFC West champion.  One time NFC champion. Two time Pioneer league champion. Two time FSC mid major national Champion.  Orange Bowl and Fiesta Bowl champion. Little more than quick fix guy to me.

@JustinSaporita Not bad.
Larry Fitzgerald is just a cool dude.  That was a great sideline interview. https://t.co/BOm9GqAyNm
I like the Green Zone. Good idea. I’m sure Twitter will react w thoughtful nuance for its debut.  #snf
@IUike5 @JohnMiddlekauff Should we ding Brady due to the AFC East?  Should we hold back praise on Rodgers due to Bears and Lions chronic mediocrity?  Good is good.
@JohnMiddlekauff People get paralyzed by his interceptions.   Never seen a QB take three straight AWFUL rosters to the playoffs in their FIRST three years in league.
@franchise2407 Second richest owner in NFL.  And mostly hands off.  Can’t ask for more.
@MaryRominger 👍
@bigkendub Never said that.  Always been a prospect.  He CAN play.   Now.
@jace_booth I think you are right.
@geoffschwartz Really did.  Kid is special.  Reminds me so much of rookie A Luck.  Probably not as gifted as a thrower but similar.

@garholaday @joelklatt He gets “lifetime achievement” underrated award.   Most underrated coach in ANY sport.  Ever.
@SLamontJones1 @TheHerd Except the Houston Rockets GM.  Who went to MIT.
@simbatrading @NathanZegura @TheHerd @bakermayfield Nope.  Would never have drafted him.   But he CAN play.   Said both pre draft.  Feel same today.
HBO is trying to convince me, but I’m not sold yet #browns #hardknocks https://t.co/9J50eDfB8c

@BigGarner64 Tomorrow.
@PSUProud1 Agree.
@Scorpio031981 I predicted 6-10.  But 8-8 wouldn’t shock me.
@PSUProud1 Not at all.  I like him.  But he just lost a remarkable OC, Joe Moorhead.  Many coaches are privately wondering how PSU will respond over next few years.
@C_Kosh Gary is fantastic. No question.
Fun lists that I mostly agree with. One exception—-where’s Paul Chryst of Wisconsin.  He’s THE most underrated coach.  In fact, WIS is most underrated STAFF in sport.  https://t.co/CLpT9YyV7k
@Keystonekilla18 Never said he couldn’t.  I wouldn’t have taken him number one but he can play.  Said that a hundred times.
@PSchrags 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 fun listen.
Just had an hour to burn so I went to You Tube and watched comedian @SebastianComedy. Tears running down my face.  Haven’t laughed that hard in along time.
@jsaute21 QB in HS.  And not very good but loved it.   Still remember first TD pass.
@AcidChrisSays @NomadUNC Certainly hope so.
@sameolg365 @PFF_Sam @TheHerd @bakermayfield 😂 Well done.

@DevMarble Hurtful
Baker two yard TD pass.  Parade scheduled for tomorrow at 4. https://t.co/84C7UeWEuB
@EddieZamites @TyrodTaylor I’m impressed.  He was accurate which he wasn’t in college consistently.  Really good arm.
Baker Mayfield drive stalls.  Some good. Moves well. Little scattered at times.  He can play.  Just a matter of when.  Right now @TyrodTaylor is better choice to win games. https://t.co/LxseMF16ZF
@nba_Jordan89 Right now. Yes he is.
@Pjm05321 He’s a very interesting player.  Big arm.  Moves ok.
Browns fans raced to twitter after Sam Darnold completes underneath routes yet...Baker throws underneath route. Then screen.  Then they run it on third and ten.  It’s almost like they are protecting him. https://t.co/kdVbVJoF1Y
Browns OL is pretty good run blocking line.  What a huge advantage for a young QB. https://t.co/9vPeIv9zP8
@LoveMyScionFRS @bakermayfield Completely understand that.
@adamcrawlins @latimes Ha.   Not leaving.
This is good.  https://t.co/PFIpSUzntW
@djsleezyg My tweet refers to, as a consumer, his attraction to me, as a player.   Nothing else.
@nathangappy @bakermayfield I’ve always said,,,I absolutely want ALL quarterbacks to succeed.   Football is just better w high end QB play.  Hope Baker crushes.  Just think his ceiling is lower than most people do.
Gotta say, can’t wait to watch @bakermayfield tonight. He’s interesting.  His confidence and style pull me in.  That probably doesn’t matter to a GM or HC but he does have a magnetic quality.
@wuds100 Was having a beer w NFL position coach tonight (humblebrag) and he thought TEddy was worth starting OL and draft pick.  Interesting either way.
@mike3zhao Agree.   Bridgewater is a quality guy to have on roster.  And in QB room. Really well liked.  Smart.  Worker.  I would love to have him on my roster.
@BruceTruette Jets fans seem to like WR group more than I do.  Just feels pedestrian.  We shall see.
@mike3zhao Or Miami.  Tannehill coming off injury.
Regardless of who gets named the starter at QB for the Jets, that guy will have a bottom five OL and WR group.   Team is best served to trade Teddy B (absolutely good enough to start somewhere) for OL help and a draft pick.
@Topper1217 @Gress2332 😂
@AndrewMarchand @nypostsports The internet rips Berman.  The Sunday ratings prove otherwise.  People like and relate to him.  Illustrates the irrelevance of Twitter opinions.  Yet again.

You know my admiration for @KingJames.  I like him more today than ever.
@spohn33 Urban got caught lying in his press release.  That’s an action too.
@SamSherrer Zero proof?  Really? Urban was caught in a lie, in his OWN press release.
@JeffSchlossj6 All four of you.  Yea, that’s he story we should cover.
https://t.co/SOhGZrvnlz
@B1GDIRTYD @TheBlackStripe_ @ashleyswavel @wsyx6 You’re jumping to the end and the conclusion you are hoping for.  We have to actually cover it DURING the investigation.  This is not difficult.
A very sad banana pancake. https://t.co/j6ONlAOb0s
@TheBlackStripe_ @ashleyswavel @wsyx6 Uh the problem champ is Urban’s history of running programs allowing garbage like this.  Zach is fired.  And should have been years ago.  The embers have cooled on his story.  Urban is STILL under investigation by his bosses.  So that’s sort of why he is stilll being covered.
@tv3a The facts like your coach has been caught lying.  And from HIS press release,  admits it.
@Jmillmusic10 @PunisherMK25 @RGEEZY Shocker.  You’re from Ohio.
@Corey_Clark22 Thanks for following. 😂
@PunisherMK25 @RGEEZY Yea, message board sycophants EQUALS journalism.  Got it.
Hey everyone, journalism is the real problem.  Not a football coach who beat his wife and was protected and enabled for years.  That’s what I’ve learned from Buckeye fans in the last 24 hours.
@jeffv216 @Brett_McMurphy @1057TheZone Yea, journalism is the problem. Not a buckeye coach who beat his wife.  And was enabled.  For years.
@jeffv216 @Brett_McMurphy @1057TheZone Assumptions? We have pictures. Texts. Multiple wives. Urban caught in two lies.  Don’t have to ASSUME much. Oh yea, a real victim.  Worry less about football and more about a women being beaten.

@NickHalo88 That’s exactly why we ripped them.  The three components that matter least.  An offense is built around QB, schemes and OL.  They included none.  Like football for 13 year olds.

@JustRyCole @the_fake_danny 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
@JustRyCole @the_fake_danny That’s really good.

@Vito_Malacari Market size is not a huge factor anymore. It’s about stars.  And sizzle.  And storylines.  The world has changed.  Now baseball PLAYOFFS can become big w right teams.  Cubs. Yankees.
@BrianJaramillo3 Every sports REVENUE is up.  Always up over time.  Just like movies now make 650 million dollars.
@butkus683 You don’t get bonus points for that.  The key is to be INTERESTING.
@LoveMyScionFRS Attendance down for over 20 teams.
@Vito_Malacari Far more.  Yes.
@Vito_Malacari Strikeouts was primary point. Analytics are killing the sport.  No baserunner.  Fewer hits.  Less activity.
@MetsDaddy2013 Read the article, champ.  Think you slightly missed the point.

@seancisler Makes the numbers even more impressive.
@TheRealTMont Wrong.  England will get huge numbers.
@showtimelbj23 Western conference finals highest in a decade.

@dtracy2001 You could certainly make that argument.  Depressing.
@Paul_Pope @FOXSports I would argue, America is now overwhelmingly rooting for England. My friends certainly are.
@HughJassoleLV I’m a season ticket holder to LAFC.  So yes, I actually can.
@ChaseBurnett8 And do we think France 🇫🇷 was really, deeply, emotionally committed to a match that had ZERO meaning?  You realize, I’m sure, that all athletes don’t bring the same level of intensity for every game or match. The WC is completely different.
Watching this World Cup elicits two strong feelings.  One, this has been an amazing couple weeks. I will never be a soccer expert but Lord this has been a festival of skill, passion and brilliance.  And secondly, the USMNT has a LONG way to go.  Sigh.
@thepapabear07 @FOXSports Soccer insecurity,  line one.
@donimaz @FOXSports Wish I could be an expert but I’m not.  And totally OK w that.
@originalAZee Sophisticated soccer guy.

@Mikey_T94 Fox doesn’t have the NBA rights.  So, that would make no sense.
@_Mingarelli27 Nobody.  Clearly.
@vl_1987 @25_JVB_BONES I love the NFL for many reasons.  Parity isn’t a priority.  I mean, you do realize I’m a Tom Brady fan, Right? He wins AFC East every year.  Hardly parity.
@25_JVB_BONES That’s a YOU problem.
I’m comfortable with dominance.  If it’s legally achieved.  Go Warriors.  #DubsAreJustSmarter
Newfound level of respect for @Giannis_An34, who won’t be joining LeBron in LA https://t.co/PrZHqDKJdV
@diegomustache Mommy 😫
@ChrisDaMatto Who will win SEC this year.  Let me guess—Bama.  Parity is a myth.
@Raganaustin When?  League been printing money for decades.  Team values skyrocketing in last five years.
@lukepashke You mean like college foootball and Bama?
Once again an elite NBA player takes less money to join a better team and fans will crush that. Would you rather they JUST cared about the dollar?  #boogie

Dan Gilbert got his team back.  So did Magic Johnson.
@Martin012Tyler Yes we have👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
Absolutely love this.  Class move. https://t.co/CqbTdEowXD
Lebron signs FOUR YEAR deal.   Translation: Let’s get it right. This is my last contract. LA is my home now. Don’t rush this process. Smart and strategic.
That Paul George news feels sort of irrelevant now doesn’t it.  #LAbron
What a day.  Great job @FOXSports https://t.co/I8zzT6jOQG
@90sguruguy For some players, yes.  Not all. Many want to win rings first. KD for instance.
Gulp. https://t.co/liBDJ3CBv6
My favorite part—thinking this new PG contract changes how difficult it is to play w Westbrook.  Suddenly, a few feel good stories today and the Utah series vanishes into thin air.  😂

Various reports that Cavs owner Dan Gilbert wouldn’t mind seeing Lebron leave because “He could get his team back.”  Actually, Lakers want Lebron for the same reason @KingJames
So, um, this is apparently a story in 2018. 😞 https://t.co/bnWqhaR6ZX
If the Lakers could pay Paul George 40M more than the Thunder, do you think there’s a chance in hell he would even consider staying?  Uh, no.  OKC’s only shot to keep him is the 💰edge.   Stop with the Westbrook/PG are “really connecting now” nonsense.
@MotorFoot163 @FOXSoccer Would be amazing. England feels too young to win it all

@Al_B1dirtybird @ramonashelburne Lebron chose Miami and Cleveland. KD chose GSW.  KG chose Boston. CP3 chose Houston. DWade chose Bulls.  Are you a writer for The Onion?
@tyson_switzer @TheHerd Keep him
@blairjones94 Ha. Thanks Blair. Can’t wait.
@ericlynchd @ramonashelburne No MJ as your GM destroys your team. Not your market.
@peguesr @ramonashelburne The Thon Maker line, whether I agree with you or not, wins the night.
@GoodIdeasCost @ramonashelburne Exactly.  KD saw his owner move team from Seattle to OKC.  Then saw his GM let JHarden go.  Then watched his coaches baby and enable Westbrook for years.  And yet—people at pissed at KD for moving?
@JHennore @ramonashelburne 👊🏼
@Chriskrajewski @ramonashelburne I’ve been saying for years I would LOVE the Knicks to be great.  NYC is an amazingly passionate hoops Mecca.
@KamranLaker No.  Monday.
@mjmontgomery14 @ramonashelburne I would.  Not conflicted in the least.
@IanChisolm @satyasingh86 @ramonashelburne 😂
@SteinMoves @pokeryoda68 @ramonashelburne Have that sourced?  Twitter makes everyone Woj.
@DonaldGarner4 @ramonashelburne You know Bama is going 13-0 or 12-1.  Should we cancel the Coll FB season?
@pokeryoda68 @ramonashelburne Maybe SA shouldn’t have ripped him publicly. They rolled dice. Trying to guilt him into playing.  Backfired.
@buckets_magee @ramonashelburne Zero leverage at deadline. What team would surrender assets for theee month rental?   Longer teams wait—less leverage they have.  SA actually has a little power now since Lakers would love to get KL into fold before season.  Better for chemistry.
@DonaldGarner4 @ramonashelburne That’s a fairytale.  NBA never had it.  MJ went 6 x 6.  Was that balance?
@satyasingh86 @ramonashelburne A. Simply not true. Does every person you know want to live in NY or LA?  Knicks are a mess.  Players have passed on them for years. B. Salary Caps would make this impossible.
The Spurs can talk tough but they have to engage w Lakers as @ramonashelburne reported today.  Wish more players would do what Kawhi is doing. Pick ONE team and make it public. Control your destiny. Teams move off players regularly—- why can’t players have leverage?

I hope Dan Gilbert is enjoying the last NBA Finals he will ever be a part of.
Steve Kerr is laughing at refs.  He should be.  Brutal.  Jeff Van Gundy deserves credit for honesty as a broadcaster.  This is really a poorly officiated Finals.
Warriors sleepwalking.  Steve Kerr smartly calls timeout.  Need to focus. Seem marginally interested.

Chris Paul is texting Lebron “I knew the game was tied”
Now we know why JR Smith was nowhere near my Top Ten https://t.co/vVI5ilfvYo
Scotty Pippen, to the best of my memory, never forgot the score. #JR
Forget scoring support, Lebron’s teammates can’t even figure out the clock.
I’m honestly amazed how good a jump shooter Lebron has become.  First ten years in the league—-didn’t even resemble this.
@andthenewross @WhitlockJason TNT show w Barkley and Shaq is great TV.   I really like Mike Breen as play by play voice on ESPN.  So 50/50 split.
Cavs play their butt off.  Damn good half. Warriors get briefly hot. We are tied.
Jordan Clarkson has been worthless.  One thing to miss, another for a guard to miss LIKE THAT.
