This is 100% true. The City of Atlanta put on one hell of a party all week long. Love a Super Bowl where everything is downtown and not spread out over 200 square miles https://t.co/rj3OmE8Uf8

Brady‚Äôs savagery continues   https://t.co/4v6Wmi2LRV
What a difference a year makes:  Last Super Bowl The Patriots defense gave up 41 points and 538 yards in a loss. Sunday? They gave up 3 points and 260 yards in a win. #adaptability
While I love The Chiefs and HOFer Patrick Mahomes.... unless The Patriots are shipped to the English Premiere League... they're ALWAYS THE FAVORITES to win The Super Bowl https://t.co/HwdoSdq8Li
So... here's what New England did this post season: 3rd team to beat the No. 1 (KC) and No. 2 (LAR) scoring offenses in the Conf Champ and Super Bowl, joining 1966 Packers and 1969 Chiefs
I laughed https://t.co/goUcfsuq9U
Speak on it Louis...educate https://t.co/ocbjGuLzgO
Remember: The Patriots signed Danny Amendola because they didn‚Äôt think Julian Edelman could fill Wes Welker‚Äôs shoes. Tonight Julian Edelman is your Super Bowl MVP

One for the other thumb. 6 Super Bowl wins in 17 seasons.. essentially batting over .333. Incredible
And The Patriots are about to become the 1st team since Miami to  lose The Super Bowl the previous year and go on to win it the next season. Miami lost Super Bowl 6 and won Super Bowl 7.
REALLY??? https://t.co/5cXiUIcEgz
The Rams are about to join The Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl 6 as the lowest scoring team in Super Bowl history with 3. There is a silver lining: The Dolphins came back to win the next two Super Bowls after that
Rams defense must do now what it‚Äôs done the entire game.. to give The Rams one last chance
A YOLO pass if there ever was one https://t.co/K0ZUdrYfhv

POINTS!!!!
For those wondering... the fewest points ever scored on Super Bowl Sunday is 21 in Super Bowl 7. Dolphins 14 Redskins 7 in Miami‚Äôs perfect season
Uh.. both teams Jason..both teams https://t.co/gIkXaokOhV

Go play Madden then. It‚Äôs only boring if you only like one side of the game https://t.co/iIWuLvQSsc
That might be the most expensive commercial ever in terms of celebrity talent fees. None of those boys gave the league a discount I promise you
Brady is the most prolific  SB QB ever and The Rams were a video game offense all year.. so what‚Äôs going wrong? Understand what you‚Äôre watching.. these are two of the best coaches and coaching staffs in football. They‚Äôve both had 2 weeks to prepare. This incredible game planning
Great coaching on both sides... I love it https://t.co/KtY8Zu0rPY
I don‚Äôt care what anyone says.. defensive football is fun.
Pats are 2 of 6 on 3rd down conversions today. In the post season they were converting 61% of their 3rd downs.  Rams are getting stops.. now MUST generate offense
Jared Goff.. much like the NFC title game.. needs to calm down after a rough start
The great Gurley mystery...game two... continues
The lack of 2 timeouts ... really can‚Äôt challenge that
Does scoring first matter on Super Sunday? The teams to score first are 35-17 and have won 7 of the last 8 Super Bowls
Edelman is the offense right now
Edelman is winning the battle with Talib pretty easily so far
The deflection was the best part of that throw.. that had pick six written all over it
And The Pats mysterious 1st quarter failures continue. 9 Super Bowl 1st quarters.. zero TDs
Aaron Donald makes his presence felt. https://t.co/lhNtkE90LT
First sack of the post season for Brady
Edelman is the security blanket for The Pats offense.. he‚Äôs just so productive
The Rams have forced a turnover, made The Pats burn 2 time outs..saw them miss a field goal..and have nothing to show for it. That may come back to bite them
They had em.. just waited too late
ANNOUNCER JINX!!!
The Pats burning 2 timeouts with  over 6:00 to play in 1st quarter is by far the most unusual thing about this game so far
Rams have run a total of 3 plays on offense this quarter...with  about 6:30 to go
Yet it was... https://t.co/EOrPiwJemZ
You are not alone https://t.co/7i176LznZM
Where was the flag??? For what?
See previous tweet re SUH
Tom Brady just the 3rd QB picked on his first throw on Super Sunday.. the others being Jim Kelly in SB 26 and Ron Jaworski in SB 15
Huge play by Robey Coleman leading to that turnover... this time legally
Those are plays Suh is going to have to make tonight
If The Patriots get off to fast start..could be trouble. Remember they haven‚Äôt scored a single 1st quarter TD in any of their previous 8 Super Bowls
Somewhere..The Pips are smiling
In case I forget to tell you later... I had a blast tonight. LEGGO !!!
All of this is correct https://t.co/dLsGnB7eeN
That‚Äôs like a 5 foot putt for him https://t.co/LzfFFsyRRz
Every single one of the previous 8 Super Bowls with Brady and Belichick has been a one possession game. So the odds that eithe way Sunday becomes a blowout.. according to history? https://t.co/LgyDMriw0M
Freshies https://t.co/kvUaFVI2hn
Every NFL player should thank Aaron Donald. He‚Äôs the 2nd highest paid defensive player in NFL history.. and the 2 time defensive player of the year.. without a single preseason practice or snap each of the last two years https://t.co/ZCWrPUMJSN
Speaking of Gurley, how critical is he and CJ Anderson to Jared Goff? No team had a higher percentage of play action passes in the regular season than The Rams. If they can‚Äôt run effectively... will be that much tougher for Goff
Both Todd Gurley and Sony Michel went to Georgia.. were on the bulldogs together for one season. Which one shows out back in the peach state?
The mental imagery DOES stick with you https://t.co/58DAlVuSIx
The soap opera goes on https://t.co/XXxebJaRpV
How good has Sony Michel been for The Patriots? He‚Äôs the 1st rookie and only the 4th RB ever to have back to back playoff games with 100 yards and 2TDs. The other 3 to do it are all in the Hall of Fame: Terrell Davis, John Riggins and  Larry Csonka
The pettiness.. I like it https://t.co/TeuXgAO7yq
This will be the second consecutive (and 2nd EVER) Super Bowl matchup where one team‚Äôs starting QB (Tom Brady) and HC (Bill Belichick) each have more career postseason wins than the opposing team‚Äôs starting QB (Jared Goff) and HC  (Sean McVay) have career regular season wins. https://t.co/G00hMs6VB4
This Super Bowl is youth vs experience. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Patriots have 36 players with a total of 82 games of Super Bowl experience while the Rams have 4 players with a total of 5 games of Super Bowl experience.
They are all fantastic at what they do https://t.co/8PVpq4DfXm
One way or another we‚Äôll make history tonight: Either Rams HC Sean McVay will become the youngest Head Coach to ever win a Super Bowl, or Bill Belichick will become the oldest Head Coach to win a Super Bowl.
The Power of Zlatan behind The Rams https://t.co/TXmg7vUFjP
Ed Reed‚Äôs hat game is also Hall of Fame worthy https://t.co/V9vaFxsmqR
Rams and Patriots meet in Super Bowl 53... 17 years to the day after their first meeting in Super Bowl 36.. which set in motion the single greatest run of excellence we‚Äôve ever seen in football. Will the Patriots add another chapter to that dynasty, or will The Rams say enough?

Crazy note here, courtesy of ELIAS: The Chiefs scored 24 points in the 4th quarter last night, the most by any team in the 4th quarter of a playoff loss in NFL history.  Previous record was 22 by the Dolphins in the 4th quarter of the 1995 Wild Card Game at the Bills.

This is 100% accurate https://t.co/Oud0lPBa4l
Evan is money https://t.co/v8gbUpKdJa
Van Noy has been unreal in this first half
This game summed up by 2 throws: Brady mark that throw... Mahomes missing Damian Williams wide open for a TD on the previous drive
For Mahomes.. this game is playing out like week 6 in Foxboro. Way too amped. He settled down in that game and balled in the 2nd half.. we‚Äôll see what happens tonight
Flowers has been a beast in both post season games
Chiefs D has answered the bell... now HOFer Patrick Mahomes needs to surface
that was HUGE
The Browns.. the drive followed by the fumble https://t.co/AHAekJiCuV
It‚Äôs the second drive of the game for The Chiefs defense.. but it feels like it‚Äôs critical already for them to make a stop
Our @TedyBruschi says the key to beating Andy Reid‚Äôs team in the playoffs is to ‚Äúsurvive the script‚Äù..as in don‚Äôt get behind early with what Andy has game planned all week.
Well that was just a PERFECT drive by New England.. bleed clock.. run it up the gut and score
This is the Chiefs defense we saw all regular season
Gronk has already doubled last week‚Äôs catch total
here we go!
The biggest winner? CBS. The overtime in the NFC title game on Fox doesn‚Äôt bleed into their AFC window
History tells us The Chiefs will win The AFC Title game. Never have both #1 seeds made it to Championship Sunday..and both lost.. in the current playoff format. Then again.. all Tom Brady and The Patriots do is rewrite history so.... https://t.co/A0kppqZWEa
The Saints become just the 2nd #1 seed in the last 6 years NOT to make it to Super Sunday...joining the 2016 Dallas Cowboys
Literally no one said that about Goff  heading into last season.. but.. live your fantasy. https://t.co/9KIbEfKWft
Marcus Peters is gonna HAVE some Gumbo tonight
year two.. Sean McVay and The Rams are Super Bowl bound.. .incredible
Since you mentioned Bill Walsh: in his 1st two seasons he was 8-24 with zero playoff appearances. So maybe you should appreciate what McVay is doing https://t.co/adhplbvtNw
NOW they call PI???
2009. Saints were the #1 seed and lost to the Bucs, Panthers and Cowboys in the reg season. They went on to win the NFC title game in overtime. Ten years later: Saints the #1 seed... lost to the Bucs, Panthers and Cowboys in the reg. season.  Deja vu?
Pressure saved the Saints.. Woods was walking in if Goff hits him
If he just plays the ball he breaks that up easily
That is a BRUTAL no call...

Someone‚Äôs come around on CJ Anderson https://t.co/q14A6guqDw
The idiocy behind his tweet is the implication that some how McVay is responsible for an INT that goes right off Gurley‚Äôs hands or the other drop that went thru them https://t.co/zC6uEoaF2e
Right about now that December pick up of C J Anderson looks like a life saver
Just like we all expected.. The Rams defense is keeping them in the game
Dude..that is no small accomplishment https://t.co/OZaR6B552L

NOW would be a good time for The Rams offense to join the fray
If anyone finds out there was a huge prop bet on Garret Griffin scoring the 1st TD of the game... WE‚ÄôVE GOT SOMETHING
Holy Hell the blitz pick up by Ingram on that TD
If Josh Hill is out for the game..changes what looks The Saints can throw at The Rams. Remember..Watson already inactive..TE‚Äôs getting thin
Peters on Thomas.. cue sideline shot of Sean Payton
Being down only 6 is a gift for The Rams...best case scenario after nightmare start
Said it when they signed him.. Davis was a great addition...and what a play
FYI..if your‚Äôe wondering when was the last time both #1 seeds lost on Championship Sunday.. it last happened...never.  Under the current playoff format..1990..both 1‚Äôs have never lost the game before the Super Bowl
Kamara on a defender with the number 94? That‚Äôs a win all day
4 teams... 2 games... 1 dream: To play in Super Bowl 53. Best day of the entire season
Let‚Äôs... DO THIS

If you reside in one of the states where this is legal:The Patriots haven't been an underdog since Week 1 of the 2016 season, but have thrived in this spot, having gone 5-1 ATS with five outright wins in six games as a 'dog over the past five seasons.

Good news for The Rams: Jared Goff has thrown 3 Pass TD in each of his first 2 starts on the road against the Saints. Bad news for The Rams: They are the only 2 losses in his career when throwing 3 Pass TD in a game.
If the Rams win Sunday HC Sean McVay would become the youngest head coach in Super Bowl history. He‚Äôll be 33 years old by the time the Super Bowl starts. Mike Tomlin currently holds the distinction for youngest Super Bowl head coach (36).

As @HermEdwards says....any plan that can‚Äôt be changed is a bad plan https://t.co/e6JLNfXBhL
The @Patriots are the first team since the 2003 Colts to score TDs on their first 4 possessions of a playoff game.  And goodnight https://t.co/tBd8qI8a2h
9:00 left in the 1st half and we‚Äôre already in the danger zone for the @Chargers . They must stop The Patriots from scoring on this drive...so far 0-3
Unacceptable for a veteran like Rivers to get flagged for 2 delay of games in the 1st half
Edelman is a beast...carry on
https://t.co/Mc6iIkKU5W
Or any qualified QB in NFL history to complete a pass.. Drew Brees holds the record at 74.4% https://t.co/IxZxN6WN1m
Or any PGA tour player was to make a putt last season between 5-10 feet..66.2% https://t.co/IxZxN6WN1m
Bad sign for LA: In this post season teams that score first are 6-0 heading into today‚Äôs two games
So now every possession becomes so important for The Chargers.. because that 1st Pats drive consumed almost 1/2 the 1st quarter
If The Patriots win today, it would be Tom Brady‚Äôs 13th AFC title game appearance in 18 seasons as a starter..excluding 2008 when he missed 15 games. That‚Äôs 76.5%. Which means Brady is more likely to be in the title game than Lebron James is to make a free throw, 73%
Patriots/Chargers: New England did not lose at home this season.. 8-0. The Chargers have not lost a game outside of Los Angeles.. 9-0 including playoffs. One of these marks will be changed today in Foxboro
Also? The most maligned defenses in the playoffs were a big part of their team‚Äôs wins.
Saturday‚Äôs results showed us once again that the bye matters: In both games the rested team beat the team that came out n hot
And that‚Äôll do it. Rams win makes teams that get at least 225 rushing in a playoff game 37-1 since the merger
Or just pooch it. Drilling it into end zone made no sense https://t.co/q9qLL8g9hT
20 carries 110 yards 2 TDS 5.5 per carry. Take the L here and log off https://t.co/G8T1E2UYTR
We got a ballgame.. and kick it deep with 3 timeouts and the 2:00 warning
Oh.. and the last playoff meeting between these two in 1985 in The Colesium? The Rams ran for 269 yards https://t.co/Dz8HgvPUGo
Rams are over 225 yards rushing right now. Since the merger of 1970.. playoff teams are 36-1 when rushing for 225 or more
Suh made sure that one had no chance
Tedy you just needed the Giants to hold him https://t.co/ZcVsUbt72c

The Rams were supposed to be the team that couldn‚Äôt stop the run...
NOPE https://t.co/kqWUg6WmpG
What was that call?
Zeke with Chik Fil A moves
No pass rush from Dallas right now
All the motion in The Rams backfield is  messing Dallas up
Dallas had like zero production from their TEs for most of the season... and they‚Äôve been great down the stretch
So Jeff Saturday with the best analysis on that Cooks TD that won‚Äôt be: ‚Äú Man Jones staying in the mud... now you‚Äôre gonna stink all game‚Äù my guy
Do not disrespect Cortrelle Javon Anderson https://t.co/xUXqkhGtyL
Ticket sales were about 30 % for Dallas https://t.co/G0fUJciCdh

Kill it as always kiddo https://t.co/zekHITfYYB
Just like we all thought... The Chiefs defense is going to be the difference in this game
Leonard‚Äôs arms are incredibly long
Well played https://t.co/sH2IfVY2JA

When Adam Vinatieri this is a field goal in the snow? You know it‚Äôs not your day
Who‚Äôs having a worse day? Colts or the refs in the snow?
Chiefs setting up for the double tap: Score to end the half..and get the ball to start the 2nd half. Smart to not snap the ball before the 2:00 warning
The Colts have pulled off the unimaginable: They have a touchdown but still no first downs
Game changer
Chiefs defense starts with 4 straight 3 and outs. The Apocalypse is nigh https://t.co/zvJzI3zusC
The 1st quarter summed up: Chiefs 2-2 on 4th down, Colts 0-3 on 3rd down
How you feeling now after they‚Äôve forced 3 consecutive 3 and outs? https://t.co/dW5kGoS4JX

Damian Williams has been phenomenal since they let Kareem Hunt go. Just a 5 play 90 yard drive in the slop..amazing
That 3 and out by Chiefs defense about as rare as it gets. They averaged giving up at least 1 1st down on drives 76% of the time.. highest in the league
Will Shields looks like he could still play
In fact.. The Colts have never lost a playoff game to The Chiefs...4-0..including the no punt game in the 2003 post season https://t.co/oRBNGiQPIw
The last playoff meeting between The @Chiefs and The @Colts ? A 45-44 Colts win that included the 2nd greatest comeback in NFL post season history... Colts were down 38-10.
A combined 89 TD passes walk into. Arrowhead Stadium today... that has never happened before

Lamar Jackson‚Äôs career high in passing yards was 204 vs Chargers in week 16. The point being if the running game isn;t working don‚Äôt expect him to throw their way to points
Man if The Ravens can just settle down on offense...their defense is doing an amazing job

Lamar Jackson this season? 695 rushing yards. Philip Rivers in his career? 580 rushing yards. They go about this job...differently
That ball had some steam on it
Lamar Jackson was 7 years old when Philip Rivers thru his first NFL pass in January of 2005. Today..they square off in a playoff game

Heading into this final drive... Seattle only has 73 rushing yards.... they came in averaging over 160. Great job by Cowboys defense
Ballgame
Take some of THAT Stiff arm
Great play by Wright... but if Dak leads him that‚Äôs a walk in touchdown
Dak is short but that‚Äôs a great play call and a good job by the Dallas coaching staff to have that check in there off the look the defense is giving them
Man a perfect throw by Russell
Best part of working tonight? Watching the games and listening to both @tthasselbeck and @SaturdayJeff talk about how much weight they‚Äôve gained this season. Some suit buttons working overtime...
Big stop there by Seattle
Perfect throw by Dak...perfect
What a play by Lockett
Not sure attempting a 58 yard FG was the right call there. Seattle now  set up with a short field and they get the ball to start the 2nd half

Seattle led the league in rushing this year. Last team to lead league and win SB? Bears in 1985. Zeke was leading rusher. Last team with leading rusher to win SB? Broncos and Terrell Davis in 1998
This is also the 1st game since his senior year in High School that Deshaun Watson has started and finished...that his team has lost by more than one score.. a span of 69 games
And that‚Äôll do it. Texans fall to 1-55 all time when trailing by 21 or more..including playoffs

Texans still haven‚Äôt stopped them on 3rd down
This sums up the 1st half: Texans 4 mental mistake penalties, two failed 4th down conversions, Colts went 7/7 on 3rd down and Luck is on pace for 382 passing yards
Horrible call .. just pick up the first
Fourth mental mistakes penalty by Houston
There is ZERO pressure on Luck. That‚Äôs the biggest difference in this year‚Äôs Colts team to every other one he‚Äôs played for

No surprise there... Luck led the  league in TD throws to tight ends with 20...and the most by any QB since Tom Brady had 24 of them in 2011
What a couple of posers... https://t.co/96v8CFIKIP
Keep in mind Luck threw for 863 yards in 2 games against The Texans this season
Remember: it‚Äôs not how you start.. it‚Äôs how you finish. Colts started 1-5 and are in the playoffs. Texans started 0-3 and won their division.

I'm not sure there is a war on football, but if there is.. it's losing badly. all that being said...love listening to my guy @merrilhoge https://t.co/o8MDFXVWGS
There were 66 total touchdowns in Week 15 - NINE fewer than any other week this season (including the weeks with teams on bye).
In December.. suddenly it's defense that's winning in the NFL. Saints  have allowed 17 points or fewer it 6 straight games..tying the longest streak in franchise history
Whenever the list is you and Walter.. it's a really good list https://t.co/EiPMaWfLvt
Yup that one too, should have included https://t.co/Ke6SCYXnDs
Really bad series by Cam: celebrates 1st down instead of calling timeout and then throws an INT killing points before the half
Christian McCaffrey TD pass? Don‚Äôt mind if I do #bonusfantasypoints
Week 15 was streakbuster week: Browns ended 11 straight losses to Denver, Niners ended 10 straight losses to Seattle, Bears ended 8 straight losses to Packers and Steelers ended 5 game losing streak to Patriots
Not only did the @Vikings run the ball against @MiamiDolphins they ran over their OL: Minnesota had 9 sacks. Keep in mind they also had a 10 sack game against Detroit.
The loss to The @ChicagoBears means The @packers  are now 0-7 on the road. The last time Green Bay went an entire season without a road win? 1958
nightmare fuel for O Linemen https://t.co/mSdPIEqjS3

Big win Sunday for The @steelers , but now they play The @Saints : The Steelers will become the 13th team to play Tom Brady and Drew Brees in consecutive games. Of the previous 12, only the 2005 Broncos won both games.
The Rams have now had back to back  games with 3 turnovers.  Before these two weeks they hadn't had a 3 turnover game since week 5 of last season.

Is defense back in the NFL? This week there were 49 combined points on Sunday &amp; Monday Night Football, the fewest in any week this season. The next fewest was 74 combined points back in Week 2!
So Jon Gruden said he was "surprised" by the firing of Reggie McKernzie. That statement is:
great player,.. great person https://t.co/JydQfUEpOB
So to recap that sequence in NFL officiating: First they call the penalty on # 65 on defense... there is no 65 on defense for Minnesota. They then say it was on 65 on offense.. except Germain Ifedi didn‚Äôt do it.. #66 did... https://t.co/JT4xuA52mh
Kirk Cousins is 0-6 on Monday Night Football and has a chance at ignominious history tonight. The only other 2 QBs to start 0-6(Joe Namath and Archie Manning) on MNF never made a 7th start on Monday NIght. Tonight.. is # 7 for Kirk

Vikings/Seahawks: Kirk Cousins is 0-6 in his career on Monday Night Football. The only other 2 QBs to lose their 1st 6 MNF games? Joe Namath..and Archie Manning
So @PatrickMahomes5 is on pace for 52 TD passes, in his 1st year as a starting QB. Here's the entire list of QBs in NFL history that have thrown more than 50 TDs in a single season:  Peyton Manning.  End list
The best part of the Bears "big boi" TD pass to Bradley Sowell? The personnel grouping was Mitchell Tribusky, 6 Offensive lineman and 4 Defensive lineman. Not a  single "skill position" WR , TE or RB https://t.co/hoK4w2lt42

So in a league dominated by offense... both opening drives thwarted by defense.
Big Mitch energy on this drive
Someone should tell Jon Gruden https://t.co/a0RZVFudAA
That was thrown out the window from the first whistle https://t.co/ZEhYYxemE4
How big was that bounce? Essentially it means all Dallas has to do is win the Giants game and win the NFC East
Of course that‚Äôs how that game ended
The Steelers season peaked with their 50 burger win over Carolina
The refs are out of control in this game
And then... that happened https://t.co/GWFIEnMnXh
Yes https://t.co/0hb2xFjCpb
Speak on it https://t.co/908yuXzJY9
That‚Äôs Amari! And that was the best drive from Dak all game
Chargers D for the win
Darren Sproles is still fast
And... another fumble for Dak that‚Äôs 12 on the season. He has 3 turnovers in this game and it‚Äôs why Dallas is only up 3
üëçüí™üèº https://t.co/LbmAsH85Gw
Gallup was wide open there.. that‚Äôs just a terrible throw by Dak
If Dallas can muster ANY offense this defense will carry them to the NFC East. They are legit on every level
The Niners/Broncos game can be summed up thusly: George Kittle has turned into Gronk..and Von Miller has been offsides 300 times
Dallas has held the ball almost 3 times as much as Philly, has more than 4 times the total yards of The Eagles...and lead by only 3 points. Not a recipe for success
Michael Bennett plays with a toddlers shoulder pads
Bradley Chubb just sacked the LT and the QB on that play
Golden Tate...what a great block
I love football...that is all
The best https://t.co/CW5hhvyQEA
OK.. this one I‚Äôm CERTAIN OF. The Saints are NFC South Champs...and have done it in back to back seasons for the first time in franchise history. Seriously, like for real, this is true
MIAMI AGAIN! When Tom Brady starts in December... he‚Äôs 25-2 on the road in December... ANYWHERE but Miami. With today‚Äôs  miracle.. Brady falls to 1-6 in Miami in December..his personal house of holiday horrors
NEVER MIND! https://t.co/FMLuuwmw7V
And that‚Äôs the AFC East for New England..and a 16th straight 10 win season for New England... tying the record set by the 49ers . Incredible
And we have.. OT IN KC
A really bad one with zero touch.. kind of like the one on the previous play.  It‚Äôs happened a few times this season.. https://t.co/LHDPpgso9k

Rams/Bears:  Two highest paid defensive players will be on the field. Aaron Donald (MVP)... and Khalil Mack combined step onto the field bringing over 176 million in cash between the two of them.. https://t.co/9li4d4ZNi0
Steelers/Raiders:  PIttsburgh trying to end a 2 game losing streak but are 0-3 vs AFC West this season..and won‚Äôt have James Conner..who accounts for 81% of their rushing yards...2nd highest in league behind Saquon Barkley‚Äôs 83%
Eagles/Cowboys:  Dallas going for 5th straight win against Eagles whom their current 4 game winning streak started against. Feed Zeke: Dak completing 76% of his play action passes during winning streak. Philly has toughest remains schedule.. Road games vs Dallas, Rams &amp; Redskins
Broncos/Niners:  Bradley Chubb needs 2 sacks to break Denver‚Äôs rookie record..held by Von Miller.  Broncos 1st game without Emmanuel Sanders who led Denver with 71 grabs. 2nd highest on team? 36, by Demaryius Thomas..who‚Äôs now on The Texans
Bengals/Chargers:  Cincy has lost 4 straight while LAC has won 8 of their last 9 and are looking for their 1st 10 win season since 2009 when they went 13-3
Colts/Texans:  Houston going for a 10th straight win..against the team their current 9 game winning streak started at... a week 4 win over Indianapolis
Giants/Redsksins: Mark Sanchez‚Äô 1st start since November 26, 2015. And maybe he‚Äôs just auditioning for his next gig. The Giants are the only NFC East team he hasn‚Äôt played for
Saints/Bucs: New Orleans can clinch the NFC South with a win OR a Panthers loss to The Browns. When these two me week one they combined to score 88 points..most ever in a week one game
Ravens/Chiefs:  Baltimore‚Äôs #1 scoring defense vs The Chiefs #1 scoring offense. 6th time in last 20 seasons that‚Äôs happened after week 10...and the #1 offense won 4 of the previous 5 matchups..per @EliasSports
Pats/Dolphins:  A win by New England would give them their 16th straight season of 10 wins or more...tying the record by the 49ers. However: when Tom Brady starts road games in December he‚Äôs 25-2 in places not named Miami... 1-5 IN Miami
Falcons/Packers: Julio Jones needs 77 receiving yards for his 5th straight 1400 yard season. No one has ever had 5 straight 1400 yard receiving seasons in NFL history. It‚Äôs also the 1st Packers game without Mike McCarthy as their head coach since January 1st, 2006
Panthers/Browns:  During their 4 game losing streak Carolina is-7 in turnover differential..and now they face a Browns team with 27 takeaways on the season...2nd best behind The Bears

Gambling fun on Thursday night games: Dating back to last season, the last 13 home favorites on Thursday games have won outright, and they have gone 11-0-2 against the spread, including 7-0-2 this season... Tennessee was a 5.5-point favorite over Jacksonville.

Not getting better for Kareeem https://t.co/TrgEgFttQs
Yet amazingly...he still didn't get  100 yards in the game https://t.co/mo3H5rOxzM
If only Kelsey Grammar had gotten the correct spelling as a kid https://t.co/nYEMZmkVm8
That was a ridiculous effort by Kelce on that TD
When you‚Äôre looking for a stat to explain The Warriors depth over the last few seasons https://t.co/HAwKfqddy4
I‚Äôm already prepping for Mark Sanchez‚Äô future career with The Giants so he can complete the NFC East grand slam
What Coaching by Washington... just giving Sanchez another chance at a one play 90 plus yard TD
On a more serious note.. that‚Äôs an amazing thing to see AD do that at 33...and no one came close to chasing him down
THAT‚ÄôS WHAT SANCHEZ DOES!!!!
Here comes the Sanchize
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever seen a QB complete more passes while getting crunched than Wentz.
At least not in the state of Pennsylvania https://t.co/reuliTE5Qp
That drive was artistry from Wentz
Dallas LBs have been great this season https://t.co/2uQVN5bkoS

This is exactly right Jim. No one is better by a wider margin at his position.. than Donald is at his.. in an era where defense has been essentially legislatively neutered.  He leads the league in sacks, tackles for losses and QB hits, while being double teamed 73% of the time https://t.co/JFJTTGxk3J
Welcome to the club Roast.. glad to have you on board https://t.co/lAyWCI3TR2
He's making a case.. we just need to pay attention to it  https://t.co/YmE2EGXq0g
Will all due respect to Mike Leach.. balance does matter in the NFL. During The @HoustonTexans  3 game losing streak.. they ran it 34% of the time. In their 9 game winning streak.. they're running it 45% of the time... 3rd most over that time frame
The @HoustonTexans have not lost since September 23rd.  Since that time we've had 2 NFL Head Coaches fired, The Red Sox won The World Series, an NBA season has started, Mid terms have come and gone and we've celebrated Halloween, Thanksgiving and Diwali. And Hanukkah has begun
He or Brees are more than likely going to win... but what Donald is doing is ridiculous https://t.co/hqJYtsJ3Ha
Von is incredible. He and Chubb hav 22.5 sacks. I think the best year for Von and Ware together was 24 https://t.co/3eXd14HzlV
Field from the top rope https://t.co/8O3t3GZKwD
yep yep https://t.co/kWqXcPc9uo
everybody wins! https://t.co/17bxJeZboF
So who should win the Heisman?   Kyler Murray has a 96.0 QBR this season and Tua Tagovailoa is at 94.2. In the first 14 seasons QBR was tracked, the highest QBR entering bowl season was 93.8 by Andrew Luck in 2010.
If The Bears beat The Rams..and Khalil Mack comes closer to Donald's 16.5 sacks I will consider. Thank you sir https://t.co/ca2qETNUXS

The Steelers are 3-3 at home this season. Those 3 home losses are tied for the most in a single season under head coach Mike Tomlin. Pitt hasn‚Äôt lost 4 home games in a season since 2003‚Ä¶ but their next home game? Against the Patriots in Week 15.
So...now what?  https://t.co/UaEAg6GURj
If it's a high ankle sprain... let's not assume anything. There's no guarantee he'll be healthy https://t.co/rt2HOkEDG5
every rookie qb taken in the 1st round has the same number of wins at this point...3. Lamar is the only one that hasn't lost a game yet...even though wins and losses are not a quarterback stat üòÄ https://t.co/ifxl1Ap8W4
History says this is an elimination game for the Eagles (5-6) tonight. Since 1990 (when the playoffs expanded to 12 teams), 107 teams have been under .500 after Week 13. 106 of those teams missed the playoffs. Lone exception? 2008 @Chargers
Each of the 5 rookie QBs drafted in the 1st Round have won 3 games as the starting QB this season. Lamar Jackson‚Äôs record looks a little different, though.  Lamar Jackson     3-0 Josh Allen              3-6 Baker Mayfield    3-6 Sam Darnold        3-6 Josh Rosen            3-6
good read https://t.co/RtXkAsCaqw

Also? a win Sunday and they'd tie The Niners record of 16 straight seasons of 10 wins or more https://t.co/g0MDPRSNQ1
So The @Steelers fans wake up this morning knowing that last night for the first time ever Pittsburgh blew a lead of 16 points or more at home. Prior to Sunday they had been 174-0-1 with a lead of 16 or more at home
Yep https://t.co/vRxVzYSRdr
This https://t.co/90wYH4iEaH
How does an NFL crew miss a blatant false start like that? I mean come on
Pretty decent Sunday for @JJWatt . His Texans win a 9th straight game...and then he gets to kick back and watch both his brothers play on Sunday Night
And that year the Head Coach resigned. So this is the first time ever Green Bay has fired a coach in season. https://t.co/F1gts9ZW1B

CHICAGO SPECIAL!!!!
Chase has to throw that one away
What is happening at Met Life? The rarest of rare.. a recovered onside kick!!
Aaron Donald man...2 more sacks.. leads the league with 16.5 as a DT..incredible. Also leads the league in QB pressures and tackles for losses. Any way you slice it he‚Äôs having an MVP season
Andrew Luck‚Äôs streak of 8 straight games with at least 3 TD passes in SERIOUS jeopardy
As previously noted... https://t.co/tA7VsisYNJ

Yeah...he wasn't in the neutral zone. https://t.co/2VTVXCnrMu
They won the game... and last night was living proof that sacks are not the know all end all stat. Saints had 7 sacks... Dalllas only had 2... but they constantly PRESSURED Brees right up the gut. That‚Äôs why he had his 2nd lowest passing yards in his Saints career https://t.co/x9WZ1wl7v5

Biggest winner tonight? The Rams
Forget the completion streak..that was the best play of the game for Dak
Yes this is correct https://t.co/ogTsHmHe9K
That ball should come to the 20
Looking at the replay..that did not seem clear cut on on what was a huge play in this game
Randy Gregory...again
Man you cannot say enough about this Saints run defense
Bookmark that Gregory penalty if The Saints come back to win this game. Just an awful mental mistake
With that TD pass.. it‚Äôs 10 seasons with at leas 30 TD passes for Drew Brees...most in NFL history
That‚Äôs 3 1st downs on penalties by Dallas on this drive....brutal
Like you belong Gil, like you belong https://t.co/98UXgxd7Qx

You were saying? https://t.co/WvDmd6snHx
For those interested...the last time The Saints were shut out in the 1st half in the regular season? 2014....against....you guessed it..Dallas

How good has The @Saints offense been this season? The Saints have scored on a league-leading 61 % of their drives. According to Elias, that would be the highest rate for any team since the schedule expanded to 16 games in 1978. The current record is 53 % by the 2007 Patriots

Here's the biggest question: If Dallas gets down by 10 or 14 early in this game.. will they have the patience to stick with the running game?  Or will they abandon their best chance to get back in it and start slinging it? https://t.co/OUHrqelLH6

Well done Geoff https://t.co/3hZDDVQXdE
Will never understand short situations where the QB is in the shotgun and then runs it... just allowing defenders time to get where they need to be.
Football?
Dolphins/Colts:  Andrew Luck has thrown at least 3 TD passes in 7 straight games, 3rd longest streak in NFL history. If he gets 3 today he‚Äôd tie Peyton Manning for 2nd longest with 8. Manning did it in 2004. Tom Brady has the longest streak of such games at 10 in 2007
Steelers/Broncos: Pittsburgh going for a 7th straight win.. but Big Ben is just 2-4 in Denver including playoffs
Seahawks/Panthers:  Carolina happy to be home after two straight road losses.  Panthers have won 10 straight at home and have a league high 10 INTs at home
Giants/Eagles: Eli needs 204 passing yards for a 14th straight 3000 yard season. Only others to do that? Brett Favre, Drew Brees and big brother Peyton.  Eagles are averaging 8.1 fewer points per game than they were a year ago
Pats/Jets: Tom Brady has 1 TD pass in his last 3 games. Brady hasn‚Äôt gone 2 straight games without a TD pass since 2006
Browns/Bengals: Cleveland looking for their 4th win of the season. They had 4 total wins in their last 3 seasons combined. Bengals are giving up an NFL worst 36.4 ppg since week 6
Jags/Bills: Jags trying to avoid a 7th straight loss after a 3-1 start to the season

So right now Phil can‚Äôt miss a fairway, but he can‚Äôt make a putt and his short game isn‚Äôt working. https://t.co/HKWoi5O6sA
Let‚Äôs spice things up. On the next hole both guys have to play with Pat Perez‚Äô hair, Samuel L. Jackson‚Äôs glasses and Charles‚Äô shirt

The other crazy stat of the night? For all 11 games this season The Redskins games are predicted by who scores first. Washington has scored first in their 6 wins.. their opponent has scored first in their 5 losses
This is the stat of the night https://t.co/CdVRMsbTs4
The Saints play defense... as well as score a ton of points. These seems like a good combination
Austin Carr was one of my favorite players in the draft a couple of years ago. Kid has so many talents away from football. Won the student athlete talent show at Northwestern, plays piano, sings...and was a philosophy major
Your weekly reminder Alvin Kamara was not the starting running back at Tennessee...
This seems... good https://t.co/Is4TM0dBII
https://t.co/ArtX99j4Kl
The lack of urgency by Washington on this drive is kind of remarkable
He made the right decision...but the wrong call. 4th and inches.. QB sneak https://t.co/PxCDQaHmqk
Just have Dak lean forward....
Dak is strong..and elusive. He should have eluded Zeke putting him in the bucket though.
And they say people don‚Äôt play defense anymore.... https://t.co/fCeYupNMhf
What he said https://t.co/9dOSCQ63yK
This is excellent on SO MANY LEVELS https://t.co/xTQplpVS6A
THAT‚ÄôS AMARI!!

No Ty Smith a big reason why Dallas can‚Äôt get rhythm on offense today
1st and goal from the 4.. Zeke averaging over 5 yards a carry.. but let‚Äôs throw it twice. Come on this isn‚Äôt hard.
Do it Dak...what a play
Allow me to be the 1 millionth person to say.. I‚Äôm all in the new Lion King
Let‚Äôs also add that 10 different Bears have picked off at least one pass this year..and Eddie Jackson has 5 defensive TDS over the last two years.. no other player has more than two. But yeah..that secondary is bad üôÑ https://t.co/vVDvrUm7wS
In Payne and Allen in back to back years.. Washington is feasting on Alabama  D lineman
It‚Äôs not just Khalil Mack on this defense https://t.co/522ZzIEnnV

I disagree all the time with many stat we pump out and I‚Äôm never going to use that as a meltric for anything. Were it not for a Malcolm Butler INT and a Donta Hightower strip sack Brady wouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúwon‚Äù a SB since SB39. TEAMS win games... TEAMS win championships https://t.co/MjzutbXzXs
Great one! https://t.co/cEhG35YVhv
I think Phil will be down 200k before they get to the 2nd tee.. and it won‚Äôt get better from there https://t.co/t1W6aWUJrg
Exactly. He happened to be the starting QB on a team that won a Super Bowl..thanks to their defense. It makes me laugh when people say their perception of him changed when he "won" a 2nd Super Bowl. Ridiculous https://t.co/algUDbhayN
Good question .. all I know is II look at how they play. Joe Flacco once went 4/10 for 39 yards  1 INT 0 TD s in a playoff game and ‚Äúwon‚Äù. Peyton once went 28/40 400 yards 3 TDS 0 INTS in a playoff game and ‚Äúlost‚Äù https://t.co/sQUoXcC6sz

So @RamsNFL  HC Sean McVay said he might need a "couple of beverages" to relax after the Monday Night win. How many did he need?
best and worst from week 11  https://t.co/Wnv4t5ujMJ
First name that jumped to mind https://t.co/xNlxsaf5VQ
Yeah..those 2 strip sacks that led directly to 14 points didn't matter at all in a game decided by 3 points https://t.co/qzX2akFySg
Really? He did?  By himself? wow that's good to know https://t.co/8vGExVHnnA
It's hard to fathom he'd win it when his defense is getting gashed every week...but he has been a singular force in the NFL https://t.co/zEd5KtfkIR
The @RamsNFL scored 54 in a game in which Todd Gurley  had his fewest touches..and had his streak of scoring a TD in 13 straight games snapped
Folks, Don't kid yourselves: This is EXACTLY what the NFL wants:  Most Total Pts Through 11 Weeks ‚Äì NFL History 2018     7,791 2013     7,581 2016     7,390  Most Total TD Through 11 Weeks ‚Äì NFL History 2018     895 2013     844 2014     836  Welcome to the future
What a difference a decade makes The 2007 @Patriots and the 2018 @Saints are averaging the exact same yards per game 295.7. In 2007 The Pats were 1st in the NFL, This year? The Saints are 6th #rulechanges
The @Chiefs made history Monday Night. They became the first team ever in the 99 year history of the league to score 50 points...and lose. Prior last night.. 50 was the ultimate sure thing. Teams had been 216-0
Let me just say this: That Monday Night contest was the greatest Big 12  Titie game I‚Äôve ever seen

Rams.. run the ball. you have Todd Gurley
Early on... Mahomes and company with similar jitters to the start of Pats game

The best part about that sequence was Peyton was miked up https://t.co/EvhTaGVrM9
Steelers TD to win the game https://t.co/MlRwXgWFad
Family https://t.co/dru3V4Ad4D
If we‚Äôre being honest with ourselves.... the two best rookies in football are both playing for the same team: Quenton Nelson on offense and Darius Leonard on defense for Indy
woj üí£ https://t.co/BjUNC5Gcy9
In the Monday Night loss to The @Titans .. Zeke had just 6 touches in the 2nd half. In the two wins since? 15 2nd half touches vs Philly and 18 2nd half touches vs Falcons.  It's simple.. feed Zeke https://t.co/QKjoQD5em3
Just a reminder.. that should The @Chiefs win the Monday Night game vs The @RamsNFL tonight.. it would be the 2nd best Coliseum achievement for one Andy Reid  https://t.co/tOjzujjZfB
So Sunday was The @Saints 6th game with at least 40 points in their first 10 games.. that's an NFL first.  In fact 6 is the record for any season.. so.. one more and New Orleans will have the record to themselves

What a catch by Julio to tie the game. Now comes the big question: Dallas had almost the full 2:00 plus all 3 timeouts. Will they make sure Zeke gets his touches.. or are they gonna throw it all over the field?
The touch on Stafford‚Äôs TD to Golladay.... wow
Sanu and his spidey cleats with a great grab
Gary Brackett‚Äôs head is a true wonder of the universe https://t.co/ZCqfo7J0tV

And boy did they need that one https://t.co/yuNEx02tcb
Gano misses..the game stays tied.
There‚Äôs not a QB at this point i think would be taken in the top 5 picks any way.. https://t.co/1sfLqWCqlp

Oh my God Alex Smith......
If they don‚Äôt go to him either in this game or next week....essentially they‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs played his last game as a Buc and they want to avoid being on the hook for that 20 mill next season https://t.co/rkSP2RBEdZ

Correction: Olsen was more open for Carolina https://t.co/Sr6XpBX1Ek
I‚Äôm not sure Saquon could have been more open
Football?
Eagles/Saints:  Philly is 4-0 when they give up less than 21 points..0-5 when they don‚Äôt and therein lies the problem. Saints are averaging 36.7 per game.
Broncos/Chargers:  Denver has lost 7 straight road division games and they would be eliminated from the AFC West race with a loss and a Chiefs win Monday Night
Raiders/Cardinals: Oakland allows the most yards per play..which is good news for a Cardinals offense that gains the 2nd fewest yards per play
Bengals/Ravens: Lamar Jackson gets a chance to get going. Bengals are the 4th team in NFL history to give up 500 yards in 3 straight games. No team has ever given up 500 yards in 4 straight
Steelers/Jaguars: Steelers come in on a 5 game winning streak, Jags come in on a 5 game losing streak. 15th time in SB era teams with a 5 game winning streak and 5 game losing streak have met. Team on winning streak won 10 of previous 14
Texas/Redskins: With a win Houston would join the 1925 Giants as the only teams to win 7 straight games after starting the season 0-3. And no, Eli Manning was not The GIants QB back then
Titans/Colts:  Andrew Luck hasn‚Äôt been sacked in 4 straight games..and Luck has never lost to the TItans..9-0 in his career
Cowboys/Falcons: curious to see if Dallas has finally learned their lesson and feed Zeke for a 2nd straight game.

Andrew Luck is 9-0 in his career against the Titans, tied for the 2nd-most wins without a loss by any quarterback against a single team in the Super Bowl era. The only QB with a better record against 1 team is John Elway, who was 10-0 against the Patriots in his career.
Antonio Brown &amp; James Conner are the 4th pair of teammates in NFL history with a TD in 5 straight team games within a season..and the first to pull it off since @EmmittSmith22 and Michael Irvin in 1995

Are The Rams good? Absolutely. Is there run defense a massive liability? Absolutely. Giving up 5.2 yards per attempt.. dead stinking last in the NFL
The @Saints @drewbrees  is completing over 77% of his passes this season. He set the record last year at 72%. He's borderline insane right now.
Reminder: Marshall has never played in a playoff game..and now he goes to the best team in the NFL https://t.co/AMoSJcIkm5

Holy hell the block by Andrus Peat on the Ingram screen
Big Mitch Energy on that throw to Robinson
Patrick Mahomes has now tied the Chiefs record for most passing TDS in a season....in his 10th game
That was a helluva play by Baker Mayfield. Avoids the rush and throws a dart for the score
Yup. Running the ball really well. Nelson on the interior is just a beast https://t.co/eQ0uBib7Pf
Luck finds a soft spot in Jags defense... and Eric Ebron rambles in for the score. Man that week 2 win over New England seems like a LOOOONNGGG time ago in Duval County
Buffalo has scored... first. It‚Äôs their first lead in a month
Raiders/Chargers: Oakland has just 7 sacks on the season.. fewest in the NFL. If only they had...never mind.. i can‚Äôt.. it‚Äôs just low hanging fruit at this point
Redskins/Bucs: Bucs have hit the over 7 straight games with Ryan Fitzpatrick as the starter...if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing.. not just for entertainment purposes only
Bills/Jets.  I got nothing
Chiefs/Cardinals: it is what is is. Chiefs average most points per game.. Cards 2nd fewest. Mahomes himself has 29 TD throws.. entire Cardinals team has 7. Kareem Hunt has 13 TDS.. entire Cardinals team has 14
Jags/Colts: Marlon Mack going for a 3rd straight 100 yard rushing game. Last Colt to do that? Edgerrin James in 2005
Pats/Titans: New England going for their 7th straight win...would be the 5th straight season they‚Äôve had a 7 game winning streak. Only The Colts from 2004-2009 had a longer streak at 6 seasons
Falcons/Browns: Julio Jones needs 13 yards to be the fastest in NFL history to get to 10,000 career receiving yards. Would be in his 104th game. Browns have lost 13 straight games in November.
Saints/Bengals: New Orleans looking for their 8th straight win after an 0-1 start. Last season they won 8 straight after an 0-2 start so.... you can see why they like their chances
Lions/Bears: Will this be the day? Mitch Trubisky is 0-6 as a starter against NFC North teams.

There are only 2 numbers that matter in the LeVeon Bell saga: 30 million and 45 million. Steelers last offer was 30 mil in guaranteed money. Todd Gurley got 45 mill guaranteed. If Bell get's close to 45 in the spring he won, if it's closer to 30.. he lost
Essentially Jerry Jones has REALLY been the GM since 1996, His record building the team since? the Cowboys are 187-173 in the regular season and 3-9 in the postseason. ownership = job security
Ezekiel Elliott had 96 total yards in the first half.. and then touched the ball 6 times in the 2nd half. The Titans didn't keep Zeke in check.. The Cowboys kept Zeke in check..and that's ridiculous
I believe the last time he said this..he then fired Wade Phillips in season. https://t.co/i5ioJIr1Yr
Much better pocket presence by Dak on that drive.. but watching Tyron Smith just LOCK up people on the left side is absolute art work
Give Tennessee credit... 6 straight 3rd down conversions. However... you can‚Äôt win games in the 1st quarter.. but you can lose them. And Dallas‚Äô inability to take advantage of multiple scoring opportunities in the 1st may cost them this game
thoughts and prayers David https://t.co/aD70BjmGSD
So Dallas has now thrown away 2 time outs and wasted 2 scoring opportunities. 7-0‚Äôis the least they could be ahead right now
Jaylon Smith is becoming the player for Dallas he was at Norte Dame before the injury... which is great to see
That is just a horrendous throw by Dak... absolutely awful. At MINIMUM you have to get 3 points out of that
Welcome to Dallas Amari

According to @EliasSports , the Texans are the 4th team in NFL history to win 6 straight games immediately after an 0-3 start and the first since the 1970 Giants...
What was Danielle Hunter's impact for the @Vikings  on Sunday? Not only did he have 3.5 sacks.. he also had 9 tackles and 4 QB hits... plus a 32 yard scoop and score.
Kareem Hunt added another 50+ yard touchdown, which he now has 5 since the start of last season. The only NFL player with more is his teammate - Tyreek Hill.
Sam Bradford set a new completion % record in 2016, Drew Brees broke it last season at 72%...and Brees is on pace to shatter it this year completing 76% of his throws.
In the NFL.... it's about one simple thing.. can you close? During the Patriots 6-game win streak, they are out-scoring teams by 29 points in the final 15 minutes, the 2nd-best in the league. They've also  converted nearly 60% of their 3rd downs in the final quarter.

Jets/Dolphins: Miami owns the worst point differential of any of the 16 teams at .500 or better...-45. Bengals are 2nd worst at -16
