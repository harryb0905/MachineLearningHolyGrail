@getnickwright Is Tatum better than Kuzma?? Ingram??

@JoyTaylorTalks Edelman.
@getnickwright Let‚Äôs have every play reviewed, that would be fun.
The Rams are flirting with disaster.  Multiple almost int‚Äôs this game
What a throw!!! Tom Brady!!!!!! Touchdown Sony!!!! Gronk!!!!
@danorlovsky7 https://t.co/jh6ADa8Snp
@ColinCowherd Huh
@getnickwright Hightower dropping an int should be on the list.
Got away with a hold Peters
Not a catch!!
The Rams defense is not deep, Patriots have dominated TOP and are not in a groove yet.
Defense wins championships!!!
9th Super Bowl for Belichick and Brady and so far it looks exactly like the other 8.
Congrats @RickieFowler!! You have a flare for the dramatics!! Never easy to win on tour.  That was a tremendous amount of guts and resilience.  Great Job!!
@ericrmusic Egregious call, no question.  Not running on 1st down, Drew was not very good and Goff out played him in the end.  You won the coin toss and threw a pick.
@ericrmusic You had the lead at home under 2 minutes and didn‚Äôt get it done.  Bad call obviously, but still should have won the game.
@danorlovsky7 It‚Äôs playing very tough today. All back pins that are tough to get too in these conditions.  Easiest hole on course coming up for Rickie!

Unreal. @getnickwright I‚Äôm sorry
@GottliebShow That‚Äôs true
If Patterson could catch???!!!
Edelman is so tough! Reminds me of Hines Ward, not fast but dependable
Why can‚Äôt they use a normal coin?
Kick it
What a throw!! Holy smokes!
Please don‚Äôt put Gronk on defense.
https://t.co/qNiWWF3Jpb
Lots of time
What a throw!!! That was PI just in case you were wondering
Gronk!!!
@danorlovsky7 The receiver ran straight into defender. Clear as day
Romo is so good in these moments!
@danorlovsky7 He ran straight into defender
Obvious miss call on the pick play.  The refs missed another one
Can we put to rest the NFL wants the Pats in the Super Bowl??
Are you happy @jasonrmcintyre?
What a call by Brady!! The GOAT
@jasonrmcintyre Your such a Jets fan!!
This football game is twitters dream!!! I‚Äôm having so much fun
That‚Äôs a catch!! Can‚Äôt overturn it!!
@jasonrmcintyre @getnickwright doesn‚Äôt believe that
Andy Reid getting that monkey off his back!!!
DdI he catch it???
@jasonrmcintyre You saw him touch the ball???
Patriot haters will be believe the video was edited.
It‚Äôs not even close. He didn‚Äôt touch it
Uh oh, Thumbgate??
@ClayTravis What???? Get a new TV
Didn‚Äôt touch him!!! Wow!! What are you doing Edelman????
KC offense is so good. Hold them under 20 at home feels like a win
Travis Kielce is offensive PI every play.
Mahomes is a tough QB!! He‚Äôs the complete package!
@jasonrmcintyre How many games did Foles and Pederson play? 4 or 5? That helps
@ProFootballTalk https://t.co/dLDq0PbRFq
Heck of a Kick!! 2 possessions!
Filthy Mahomes!!
That was the most physical New England team I‚Äôve seen in a long time!
The Patriots have 12 picks next year.  And Tom has 2 years left.  The Dynasty will continue no matter the result this year.
@getnickwright There you are!!
@GottliebShow He was throwing to Old Gronk not the new Gronk.
Oh boy, Andy????!!!! What to do
That was great defense!! Huge momentum play
@mlombardiNFL @getnickwright NFL History!!
@ColinCowherd Good thing you bought your stock back on the Rams
@mlombardiNFL Have you noticed @getnickwright isn‚Äôt tweeting.
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Patterson is a Patriot for a while.  Extremely explosive and can play multiple positions
Incredible analysis by Romo so far.  Pats defense playing very physical on the line of scrimmage!
And the Pats did everything they wanted on that drive and lead 7-0.  Nick is breaking one of his 8 TVs https://t.co/Yidki0LqbT
@getnickwright Man you hate the Patriots.
Patriots v. Rams started the legacy for Brady, will it bookend his career???

@getnickwright More
Even the refs feel bad for the Chargers, phantom calls
@JoyTaylorTalks Something Tomlin would do.
@DrydenCurtis Agreed
Football is a safety issue, get over it.  These players are gladiators!!
Eventually all NFL head coaches will have a direct connection to Belichick or Sean Mcvay. Kingsbury played under Belichick.
Everybody hoping the dynasty is over https://t.co/A9RF8ftaYK
I find Brady dissecting the Chargers defense so much more impressive then Rodgers running around making something up on the fly.  Watching an offense unit working together is so much harder to defend.
@getnickwright where r u???
@GottliebShow It‚Äôs called being coachable. Important trait among QBs and leaders
@GottliebShow 10/12 100 yards for the GOAT.  He‚Äôs sort of good
@danorlovsky7 @RamsNFL They got to the line quickly Manning Colts style and then called the play.  They used the bye to their advantage
@danorlovsky7 @RamsNFL How tight are their formations? Seems that they start tight, go motion, and try pull the defense apart with width and create space in the middle of the field.
Nothing like Playoff Football!! Congrats to the Rams, they physically dominated the game start to finish! https://t.co/G2tdRYfMWP
The CJ Anderson pickup for the #Rams saved their season!
@danorlovsky7 @Colts https://t.co/N2VE2dQNIt

Colts ball!!!! Fumble!! @getnickwright is getting nervous!!

Rodgers doing his best Patrick Mahomes impression with that throw! #Packers

@ColinCowherd Any Giants personnel?
Lovie Smith‚Äôs beard is worth a touchdown.  It is glorious
@tom_hart @danorlovsky7 @colecubelic Horrible route, didn‚Äôt create any angle for the QB. Luckily the QB had a feathery touch

The Wolves have already lost this game with those horrific jerseys.
Lebron is great, the Cavs are not.  No one is scared of the Cavs in the east.
The matchup we‚Äôve all been waiting for Bogdanovich and Lebron really lived up to the Billing!! Lebron got the best of him tonight, but Bongda will not back down!
How is Indy still in this game??
Over and back? No.
Finally a playoff foul and Lebron overreacts. Weak

@AbbyO25 Cause he doesn‚Äôt play defense, and neither do the Patriots.
What a Game!! The eagles had the much better roster and their QB was phenomenal! Not to mention a coach who isn‚Äôt afraid!! #FlyEaglesFly
https://t.co/UwDERoBKjX
But honestly why do that if your a WR?? Control the ball at all times.
It‚Äôs a catch  and ran in for a touchdown. Cmon
I hope the stadium is more lively then I‚Äôm hearing from my TV. #Patriots
Kansas City fans have to be wondering why Pederson wasn‚Äôt calling their plays. #Chiefs
What did these eyes just witness?? #Eli#OBJ
Foles with no hesitation when he throws
One stop defense!!!! Just one!!! #Patriots
We can finally put the Patriots conspiracy to rest after that call.
Foles has been unreal.  Easy MVP so far

That‚Äôs the patriots defense holding Philly to 3.  That‚Äôs a win all day for #Patriots
@getnickwright Never change Nick!!
@jasonrmcintyre Didn‚Äôt Gilbert deliver Paul George and Eric Bledsoe for Kyrie, only for Lebron‚Äôs commitment? This is üíØ on Lebron.
The Last of the Mohicans is a top 10 movie all time. Daniel Day-Lewis is a living legend.
We forget Lebron has had the best team in the east for a decade.  Two All Star players in their prime as teammates. If he committed he would have Paul George and Eric Bledsoe.
@getnickwright @FTFonFS1 Lebron needs 2 All Star teammates to make the finals, Love just broke his hand and IT isn‚Äôt that guy anymore.

And another new coordinator for Saban. Actually both coordinator‚Äôs will be new for his 7th National Championship. #Bama

@danorlovsky7  https://t.co/rWgK2ihKcZ
The playoffs have shown the gap between the #Patriots and every other AFC team.  Situational football is playoff football.
@danorlovsky7 @jasonrmcintyre You think the jags are going to QB run this game to victory?? The Pittsburgh defense should be embarrassed.
Every time I watch a team in a critical situation, The genius of Belichick and the Patriots is obvious.
Embarrassing performance by Steelers so far.  Keep telling me how talented they are. https://t.co/cGp9MGsC6j
Blake Bortles is playing unbelievable tonight!!
Romo with great info on clock manager being controlled by league.  Makes the conspiracy wackos very pleased NFL is controlling the clock.
I mean, what are you doing Tennessee?? The timeout, then the play call?
The Patriots defense is definitely underrated.  No blown assignments and no yac. #Patriots
I expect panic from most of Twitter, but not @ColinCowherd.  It took the #Patriots a drive or to to get adjusted and we see the results.
@MrMichaelLee He missed.

@jasonrmcintyre You can‚Äôt lose by 30 to Iowa. Losing to Auburn on road not a bad lose. Schedule shouldn‚Äôt cancel you out of playoff. Oklahoma probably best team in country, but every team this year had deficiencies.
@jasonrmcintyre You said Bama‚Äôs defense is destroyed by injury, shouldn‚Äôt be in playoff and dynasty is over.  Defense shut out #1 in country and he made the right change to win the natty. Something you said they can‚Äôt do.
@jasonrmcintyre Looks like the dominance has new life. #TuaTime

@jasonrmcintyre and Jeremy Pruitt to Tennessee.
Very generous spot
@jasonrmcintyre Agreed, but the coaching has gotten better the last couple months.  Michigan just got whooped by South Carolina by the way.
How was Clemson ranked #1?

Patriots best in AFC? https://t.co/HLbnqqZP74
@CowboyFB https://t.co/RhktoU9W46
Gut check for @CowboyFB.  We were just thoroughly dominated in every aspect of the game the 1st half.
How was that incomplete?? Any video of it touching the ground??#Patriots
Why did the cowboys keep leaving the LT on an island?  Maybe chip him once in awhile?
Rivers deserves better.  Jax should trade for Rivers.

If it‚Äôs 50/50 it goes to offensive.  #PSU
That‚Äôs a touchdown!!!! #PSU
@GottliebShow I think it was a Pterodactyl.
@GottliebShow If the offensive player is moving toward the basketball, the defense has no chance anymore.
@jasonrmcintyre You do? If Ingram is what they Lakers hope they have a chance. But I‚Äôm not even that optimistic.

Texas defense getting tired
Shotgun from the 1 yard line will always bother me.
What decision?
They blew the play dead.
We recovered announcers. Wake up
You can‚Äôt gab his hand and pull him.
Alright offense, hopefully you made the adjustments to attack this 3 man line. #OKState

Texas is digging deep in the playbook.
Texas defense has been almost as good as Mason Rudolph was today.
Haven't seen this defense in years.  Really impressive https://t.co/rnTEahQYkQ
There should a stat line for drops.  Darnold gets credited for a pick 6 when it's 100% the WR's fault. The WR should get the turnover.
LOL! #USC
USC has played poorly and is still dominating this game. Texas can't move the ball and the SC offense will play much better in 2nd half.
Darnold has a little Rodgers in him.  Throws accurately from different platforms
The knee was down @joelklatt!!
You in the booth with Gus and @joelklatt? https://t.co/u8BnFX2xPg
@ClayTravis your one step closer to Chip!!
Mason Rudolph for Heisman!!! @joelklatt talk to me!!

Baker is pretty good. Heisman front runner and that's hard for me to say.
It's really hard to take anything @Joey_Galloway says seriously when he picked Baylor to win the Big 12.
The refs had instant replay and still got the Michigan catch wrong. Wow
This feels like deja vu for the @Patriots. Blown out by KC in 2014, questions about Brady then they win the super bowl.
@joelklatt podcast starting this week?
Why didn't Lebron commit to Cavs and take Bledsoe and George for Kyrie? https://t.co/syUCYXboxw

Is #USC going to Cover?
Does Harbaugh have a great 5 star QB somewhere on that roster? https://t.co/aMbXm9PFaE
New season, but Michigan and Florida both look a QB away from the college football playoffs.
The Michigan defense has a position called Viper!! Peppers was the Viper last year. Viper, Viper that's awesome.
Looked like a handball as well. #USAvCRC

@GottliebShow nailed the Jordan v. Lebron debate today. Well done https://t.co/Ghv1Sw7IJf
Didn't Lebron pick all those guys who were out playing defense against the Warriors?  Tristan and JR and Korver? @TheHerd
@getnickwright Durant is not better then Dirk??
@GottliebShow @YahooForde Best coach in Big 12 now!!
How many times last night did Kerr think, I almost picked the knicks. https://t.co/ji10HEY3J0
@jasonrmcintyre üòÇ
I'm still curious why @KristineLeahy doesn't have Lebron in her top 5 players in the league.  @TheHerd
@Augward @Rachel__Nichols @EdwerderRFA Fair enough
@jasonrmcintyre What will the Cavs roster look like next year? The Warriors have done a great job staying young with rookies giving valuable mins in finals.
@Rachel__Nichols @EdwerderRFA Is he throwing shade at his teammates? Me personally?
@jasonrmcintyre 5 final losses mean nothing to you?
@JoyTaylorTalks What is wrong with people?
The Warriors are just giving Lebron layups at this point hoping that tires him out.
What a great game!! #NBAFinals2017
JR is saving the Cavs season!!
Dribbling is optional.
This game is over without JR!! What did I just say?
Draymond has no offense this series. #NBAFinals
That ref must feel terrible.  Probably never get a Stanley Cup assignment again. #NashvillePredators
Maybe the best @VeepHBO tonight!!
@GottliebShow Can the NBA clean up moving screens?
Can't wait for @theblackpanther ! Incredible trailer!
This game is going to be very physical and chippy!! I wish I could hear all the trash talk!

Kyrie is gassed
If that's a defensive foul Curry has no chance. Bully ball
@jasonrmcintyre He should be rested he took the 3rd quarter off.
Is this the biggest Quarter of Durant's career?@jasonrmcintyre
@jasonrmcintyre Your telling Jordan wouldn't flourish in a more wide open offense style basketball? He lived on the hand check era. Dominate today
Curry 3rd leading scorer for #warriors would usually be good. Not tonight
Incredible half by Cleveland, down 6.
Draymond can be so fun to watch then a complete disaster.
How does the best shooter in the game get so many open 3's????!!!! #Curry
Lebron has heard the media, decided I'm going to get mine and beat Durant on the scoresheet because this series is over.
@jasonrmcintyre Bosh*
@jasonrmcintyre Remember when Lebron tried to get Botha me Wade to come to Cleveland? Didn't work, no chance
@jasonrmcintyre Love to Pacers for George?
@getnickwright He's going to get layups, they won't foul.  They want to keep game moving to get as many 3's as possible.  He's going to be a stat filler
@getnickwright Lebron is a great player, but shouldn't be the GM.
Steph Curry is so much better then he was 2 years ago. The best is yet to come.
I think the #Warriors could care less if Lebron gets his.  He's attacking the basket making 2's while they shoot 3's.
Will Bob Stoops coach again? I believe he will, but no clue where.
