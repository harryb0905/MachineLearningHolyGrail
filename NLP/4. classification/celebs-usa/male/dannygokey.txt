I’ll never understand how killing babies in the womb is considered a “choice” or a “woman’s right”. If we were to start aborting puppies or any animals in the womb there would be an upheaval in our society. God forgive us for such ignorance😭😭. https://t.co/NcNthxl6Ab

Less than 4 months until Christmas...just let that sink in for a moment.
When God sees you He doesn't see as you as the person you may be now-addict, failure, cheater, liar. He sees you as He called you to be through Jesus. He sees you as righteous, an overcomer, a giver, a blessing to many. Look from where you are-to who you’re called to be in Christ
Jesus came to reveal a God who defines us NOT by our sins but by HIS love.

Sometimes the only thing blocking you from moving forward is YOU. Not forgiving yourself, not letting go, not believing what God says about you, etc.
When you walk through painful situations and disappointments keep turning the page because you're story is not finished. God has already written new chapters for you that you have yet to experience. He's working EVERYTHING in your favor!!

Your struggles are no surprise to God. He is not taken off-guard by your fears, worries, mistakes and insecurities. He’s not waiting for some future version of you to show up. He delights in you, His child, right now. In fact, He gets the glory shining through our broken cracks.
You can buy God lunch today, you can buy Him clothes, you can help pay His bills, you can give Him a place to stay, &amp; you can hug &amp; encourage Him today! How you ask? If you do to the least of these (His People) you do it directly unto Him. He takes it personally.

We are not redeemed by our good deeds but by He who is King!!! #JesusPaidItAll #Grateful
God is not fickle, changing, or unfaithful. We ebb &amp; flow daily through our good choices, bad choices, good days &amp; bad days. But somehow it doesn't change His pure heart toward us. His love chases us &amp; He still blesses us in spite of ourselves. What an AMAZING God we serve!!
Many hearts are troubled today because they don’t trust God. They don’t believe that God has the BEST plan for them. So they choose their plan over His which always disappoints. Jesus said-“Don’t let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust also in me.” John 14:1 #trust

I feel in my heart some of you need this reminder from heaven. God has not changed his mind about you.  “For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.” Jeremiah 29:11 NLT
If we place ourselves in His hands and allow Him to work, the outcome is far greater than we could have accomplished on our own.  #Masterpiece #DannyGokey #share https://t.co/gzyxz9bVCs

Jesus was nailed to the cross but It was His love that kept Him there. What kind of all powerful God allows His creation to crucify Him? A God who loves us endlessly and will do anything to save &amp; heal His people who are broken &amp; hurting.

@wendylifecoach Please report ASAP. I only have this account.
@shelbz33 I think you and I will have to disagree. Anytime I have decided to help someone outside of myself God has always provided. Even when I was living in poverty I was able to help the homeless. Generosity comes from seeing things in Gods limitless ways and not through our limitations
@shelbz33 You obviously know nothing about me and was never a ‘fan’ in the first place. My organization has put $5,000,000 behind the fight of human rights and equality through building orphanages, housing homeless families, &amp; education. I’ve worked in foster care &amp; will adopt.  You??
@shelbz33 U couldn’t give me enough fans, money or popularity to change my mind. I will always speak 4 those who have no voice. Why is it that everyone who is for abortion has already been born? Woman are killing woman through abortion &amp; they are so blinded by their pride they can’t see it
This article is 🔥&amp; 😂!  So Tired of hearing the weak arguments 4 abortion. Abortion has been twisted into a woman’s right issue, yet has murdered MILLIONS of WOMEN in the womb. Also, less than 1% of abortions are tied to rape. So please don’t try to throw that bogus logic around https://t.co/DTRt0uhUOd

The tongue has no bones, but is strong enough to break a heart. So be careful with your words.
I know this may be hard for some people to understand, but you can actually STILL love people even if they don't believe the same things you believe and don't act the the same way you act.

U can be assured that God will use every heartbreak, pain, scar, &amp; unfair situation 2 make YOU STRONGER! You only have 2 put it in His hands
God knows what you need &amp; when you need it. Trust His goodness &amp; His unconditional love to fix the things that's causing you worry &amp; pain.
Maybe it's not the problems your facing that's making you miserable but your attitude towards the problems that's causing you misery.

The real losers of tonight's fight was everyone who had to endure Jamie Foxx's national anthem. 😂😂 😂😂Ok I'm done!!
Kanye be like "Jamie Foxx had the best national anthem of all time" 😂😂😂
Not sure which was worse tonight, Pacquiao losing or Jamie Foxx's version of the national anthem.
Things I learned from tonight's fight: Mayweather is better at hugging and putting his opponents in headlocks than he is at boxing.
Jaime foxx provided one of my least favorite versions of the national anthem...ever.
I hope Pacquiao mops the entire ring with Mayweathers face!!! Go pacman!!!
Who's everyone going for tonight?? @MannyPacquiao or @FloydMayweather ?

Anger, bitterness, &amp; resentment will only change your heart and not the heart of the person heart you hold those toxic emotions against.
