this winter is lasting forever, at least for tonight.
Sad to lear that Peter Tork has passed. I loved the reruns of The Monkees. Tork‚Äôs place in music goes far deeper than tv, evidenced by his friendships with the Beatles, CSNY, etc. Let‚Äôs all listen to I‚Äôm A Believer &amp; Last Train To Clarksville. RIP Mr Tork. https://t.co/BJqiYtWytk

Being in a band is a wonderful glorious adventure/bone crunching grind of fatigue, self doubt and isolation. Today is a good day to thank my band and our crew, men and women who care so deeply about each other as people.

Bullying is bullshit and ugly.  It‚Äôs not like the fun 80‚Äôs movie bully/hero dynamic, where the bully is an ass cause he snaps his gum in the hero‚Äôs face/is mean to the new kid. If you‚Äôre being bullied please ask for help until you find it.
Today I am going to play laser tag. That is all.
@MrNate408 No it doesn‚Äôt make you bad

I‚Äôm watching the John McCain Memorial service and am given great hope in seeing honorable statesmen and women pay articulate and respectful homage to one of the most honorable statesmen this country has ever had.
@lilithia I don‚Äôt know yet to be honest. As it looks now it‚Äôs a Good Things Festival date. I‚Äôll know more as we get closer.
It‚Äôs strange. I can go weeks playing live and never feel the driving desire to write. Then I find myself in a stationary place and the draw is so strong it actually stifles the creativity. The first one‚Äôs always the hardest. Somehow I love that this isn‚Äôt easy. Soon. Maybe today.
This is not only one of the best songs I‚Äôve ever heard, it‚Äôs has probably the best solo(s) ever played. Thank you @jmascis and @dinosaurjr for making me and my friends start our first band. https://t.co/YBlPCIQlIm

That's Chuck Norris RT @rcf6: @chriscarrabba show that line who is boss! You don't wait in lines, lines wait for you!

Voodoo RT @steven_harlow: Why is the new Dashboard Confessional album owning my life right now?@ChrisCarrabba
I do. But I don't have time for loooong lines! RT @jackandsallyyy: @ChrisCarrabba Do you not like Twilight? :)

Dolphins! And new moon midnight showing! All my friends are enjoying opposite styles of fun!
Writing jingles for products that don't exist.
Thinking about having a warmup show in west palm this weekend or early next week.
Ghost of a good thing, morning calls, am I missing, bend and not break, plain morning, to name a few.
Spent today working out new arrangements to some of our old tunes. Oh the memories!
Good company! RT @cybercutie: @ChrisCarrabba You, Mayer and Mraz are my top 3 inspirations. I wish I could play as well as you guys!!
Now I'm watching @johncmayer on fuse wishing I had studied guitar in school.
Learning stereos songs
Watching OKC roll over my Miami Heat. Dang.
Had a weird dream that I twittered about watching ping pong...that was a dream right?
Spent a late night catching up on this season of #dollhouse. It has blown my mind.
They start at 9pm and play 2 hours 15 Lita ford sits in
And on with the day for the rest of us.
Two morons enter, neither contribute anything to the world.
Watching some pretty roided up road rage in live action.
I'm reading a great article the march guitar player mag about one of my current guitar heroes Brad Paisley. He is a monster.
Just landed. I feel zombiefied.
I can't believe how fast the shows have sold out!  Thanks everyone! That has to be some kind of record!!
Bonnie Hunt is a sweet lady. I hope to meet her again!
@johnlefler1 says they are going to have to pixelate out our nipples to get by standards
What you might not know about a tv studio is that it is freezing...
All that being said, we are really going to have fun out there.  Pretty set. Nice people. Gonna be a blast.
This change will have us all ONLY thinking about the in and out of the song the whole time we are playing it...
The best way to play a song is to never have to think about HOW to play it as you play it...
However simple the change is, though, it is enough to rattle our confidence as we play the song...
I'm sure it will be great either way, but we have to cut our song down to 2 min 40 secs. No intro no outro should do it...
We have never done a daytime talk show before. We are in the car on the way to the Bonnie Hunt Show. It airs tomorrow.
U win Tony RT @PATCHOFBLACK: @chriscarrabba mine was cold and then the nor'easter winds knocked it out of my hand I'll trade you lol
