I have a Love/Hate Relationship with the Super Bowl!!
Gore’s Patience with his Draw action steps gives the O-Line time to work and get on there blocks. Young RBs tend to not be patient in their steps and most often times are too fast not giving the O-Line time to work! #TrustTheProcess #FootballMagic https://t.co/JLs6BcvhGS

FB should take the DT slanting in... should never pass up Color even if he is not your assignment.. https://t.co/yEh7JOxPVl
FB-in a perfect world he needs to hit the LB down the center giving the RB a 2-way read. But it looks like the LB is using a “hammer technique” keeping that outside shoulder free to force everything inside, FB needs to Roll hips on contact and drive his legs to get LB out of hole https://t.co/pzP07AZMQt
@thEMANacho He look like the Right Wing on the Punt Team

@JFKpga @RobbieGould09 Takes a TEAM EFFORT TO WIN of course but in the end it took a team effort to get you in position to make a FG.. just gotta make it! 🤷🏾‍♂️
@LeviGinger Offense showed up in spurts... didn’t play well enough to win! But gave us an opportunity to win with a makeable FG...not all on the Kicker TAKES A TEAM EFFORT.. but gotta make that kick! Period!! 🤷🏾‍♂️ #NoChill
That’s why we never took @RobbieGould09 for granted as a Team!! He always came through in the Clutch! Everyone has a job to do! I feel for this Team! Too damn good to not be playing next week!! Should have never overlooked the kicking situation this year!! 🤬🤬🤬

@greggabe What are your thoughts on Trubisky? Boom or Bust!
Read my Dawgz @DavidHaugh column about Bears taking Watson at #3.. its got me thinking!! Great stuff! Must read!! https://t.co/slsjGBmfQ8
@DavidHaugh Great column!! I understand making a splash and fixing the QB situation.. but at #3 i think that has to be a day 1 starter..
@DavidHaugh Im about to read it..
@greggabe What are your thoughts about Adams at #3??
@DavidHaugh You like watson at #3??  Even more then Adams from LSU?
@Ry_Wright33 Def need him
@MoveTheSticks Is McCafferey capable of being an every down back?
Jamal Adams at #3 is the pick for the Bears!! Has the speed, size, and intangibles to be a day 1 starter! @ChicagoBears

@Ben1Pro I like Watson.. I just don't like him at 3 and Id be shocked if they took him with that  pick..Theres ?? marks with all the top rated QBS
@BearDownBearFan true
@Ben1Pro My ?? marks on Watson... Mental Capacity to understand and succeed at QB on the NFL level as well as Arm Talent (Arm Strength, and Accuracy)
@Ben1Pro you like Watson at 3 too??? way to high at 3...
@BearDownBearFan agree but def not taking Watson at No. 3 way too high.. has to be a guy that comes in and makes an immediate impact!
@readjack I love FULLBACK NEWS!!! @Fullbacknews
@caleb5434 @peanuttillman very true!
@CoachRobPeters @LeeCompson @BestHumanTalent lmao...lets pray for the best!
@bretts_daddy @BestHumanTalent i agree..Mike Brown was a beast and great teammate!
@BearDownBearFan im not too high on the QBs in this draft
@CamWorrell you think? haven't seen him play much but we def need a corner....
@BQuinn34 @BestHumanTalent Ive got mixed feelings about Watson
@jonesfam26 @BestHumanTalent Lol
Bears Fans how do you feel about LSU' Safety Jamal Adams at No.3??#DraftTalk
@CoachMcKie Congrats to you both!! Truly a Blessing!! #McKieStrong

@afire278 money talks
@ChiBearsPundit I like Adams
The Draft is CB rich! I like my boy T. Porter, but we needed Gilmore or a Veteran Safety! Opposing QBs have been carving us up for years!
@AlbertBreer thats called good cash 💰💰💰💰
@MP2310😳😳😳😳😳😳
@DickersonESPN @adamjahns @CSNMoonMullin Fullbacks getting all the Free Agent L❤️ve!! Dying breed my "Arse"!!!
@mklisz @adamjahns not at #3
@adamjahns exactly especially in a league in which the ball is in the air 50times and you cant touch receivers...
@adamjahns theres alot of corners in this draft but the Bears do need a solid Veteran Corner or Safety to QB the secondary. AKA: Mike Brown
@adamjahns @CSNMoonMullin @DickersonESPN But there is upside on all the QBs in the draft.. you just dont have to overpay for them
@JasonGoch I feel if you are going to gamble on Glennon why not Draft a QB and pay less money...especially if there is no chance for Jimmy
@JasonGoch What are your thoughts on Mike Glennon??
@adamjahns @CSNMoonMullin @DickersonESPN What are you thoughts about Glennon?
@mrejr8234 😭😂
@JonJanke Connor is back
@TreyBizzy 😭😂
Bears fans what are your thoughts of Mike Glennon as the next possible QB in the Chi?
@SD2Mics how committed is he in the weight room? Regardless if he is a 3rd down specialist.. NFL RB has to have his body ready all season
D'Onta Foreman did 18 reps weighing in at 233, Dalvin Cook did 22 reps weighing in at 210...🤔 An NFL back should live in the weight room!!
@SD2Mics yes
McCaffrey did 225 10 times at the combine??

@autumnsjs90 @peanuttillman Made us better backs, no team we played could similate The Peanut Punch! Lol
You giys dont even know how many FF @peanuttillman caused in practice. He cost us Backs alot of money in Practice Fumble Fines #Jerk#LOL
I agree @peanuttillman is #1, im asking because my buddy @MarkGiangreco7 said Frazier yesterday.. Good friendly debate
Bears Fans: Where do you rank @peanuttillman among Bears All Time CBs?
@MarkGiangreco7 @Tbone295 @peanuttillman who were they during his era?
@Tbone295 @MarkGiangreco7 @peanuttillman no Megatron's or Moss back then!!
@MarkGiangreco7 Equal only because Les Frazier has a SB Ring. But @peanuttillman was a complete football player. Was a beast on SP Teams too
Since my boy @peanuttillman is retired.. Im going to punch him every time I see him. Payback all the Peanut Punches he gave me at practice
