Devastated by my pal Stan's passing. He was a childhood inspiration, an instructor to me when I was just getting started and a genuinely sweet man. Will miss him terribly.

Adam West kept Batman alive and thrilled my generation. It's a sad day.
Saddened not to be able to see my Geekrican fans. I hope I can see you all next year.
Bad weather and cancelled flights made it impossible to get to @PRCOMICCON. Their team was great and tried everything to make it happen!

@Brandon1628 Thanks for hangin in there!
@AGHMaryBeth @AGHChad Great!
All right -- I must depart again. Not because I want to fall asleep watching #Gunsmoke but because tomorrow is a big day.
@ryan_buell Great film and we had a blast
@AGHChad Where's the pictures? @ryan_buell @AGHMaryBeth
@Rafael_Grampa We give new publisher's a lot of rope with which to hang themselves. My apologies.
@Jerichoholico Thank you for such a lovely remark. Glad you enjoyed it!
Well, let us know when you'll be in the city again and keep in touch! And ya gotta hand it to @agidgetwidget -- she's thrilled too.
There isn't much, that's more convincing, than that.  #AGH
The film spoke of sincere conviction. #AGH
Thank you, @ChadCalek @Ryan_Buell @PhotoSerg @AGHMaryBeth ... It surprised me.
I WANT to see this again: http://t.co/xKVrLOWC
It's the FIRST MIDNIGHT !
Ahem
Uh Oh... I gotta go. But I'll be back later tonight. It's great to see folks here. Thank you again for all the support -- FM
@The_Flocco You got it! Not sure when I will be back on again this evening but I'll look for your questions.
@KyleJBaker HA! Ya gotta have some fun, right?
@CocoWorks YES. And that cape. Brilliant.
@KyleJBaker This is what @agidgetwidget says helps the time. And something she calls #hashtagging -- no idea
@KyleJBaker Yeah, what are you doing here, anyway? What am I doing here? Where's @PULPH0PE ?
@UncleGustavo Hey! How are you? Yeah, it's weird.
@ColleenDoran @agidgetwidget When are we all going to be in the same vicinity again? This is ridiculous!
@KyleJBaker Ha! You? Never!
@MichaelChiklis THIS IS FOR MUFFIN! I can't believe I still remember that story. Get that foot of yours well soon.
Later on this evening, I will try to answer some of the questions floating around out there. Again, still getting used to Twitter!
Speaking of cool stuff -- have any of you seen the #AZUMI films? Watched them both again last night. Highly recommend.
@THEBRYANHITCH Yes, regrettably, I am older; or at least they tell me I am. Still waiting for my pet T-Rex!
Hey, @davegibbons90 you are never too late to jump in! Thanks, Sir! And of course, I want to know what you & @mrmarkmillar have cookin!
Well, @JimLee, you show us how it's done yourself -- on a roll & I think @Joke2far will agree? Gotta get together soon!
Missed you again, @JimLee ! We gotta figure ONE of these days we'll be free to have dinner in #NYC . Best to you & lovely @Joke2Far -FM
Will do my best to respond so thanks in advance for waiting. Still figuring out Twitter. I am going to go read some #comicbooks -- YOU?
I have so many Mentions and Questions posted here from the -- I think it's called -- #Twitterverse ? ...Thank you for patience, it's a lot!
I know I am missing several people. A "little" tired... (This is what happens post-comic-con, as most of you know.)
How can I not mention @MidtownComics and how awesome were they to arrange for the signing on Saturday?
Especially, #NYCC @BobSchreck @Pulph0pe @mattfraction and @nerdist for an electric panel. Hope all who attended had as much fun as we did!
A big thank you to everyone, @NY_Comic_Con , for this weekend's event. Many thanks to all @LegendaryNews for organizing events for fans.
I think a visit to Scotland is in order @mrmarkmillar For now, I tip my hat, "Thank you."

#Propaganda ...... #Discuss
Why? BECAUSE IT'S COOL. #GoodNight
Oh, @SamuelLJackson -- I think I'll follow you... And @AGHChad @AGHMaryBeth @Ryan_Buell and @PhotoSerg too.

Hey, guess what?
PS. For all you #TOS and #TNG debaters right now, the answer is: #KIRK .
In the meantime, let's let Monday do its thing and tomorrow, I'll be online with something interesting. Time to draw some dinosaurs.
All right, it's true: #HolyTerror will be in stores on September 28th. I will be at #NYCC and letting you all know my schedule soon.
So many mentions and my breakfast is here. #BACON. You understand. See you soon and be good. #FM
Thanks, @MouthDork , you are a fan of waxing philosophical about comics, too? Always a good time. FM
I wonder if anyone caught the secret I let slip at the panel yesterday? If you know what it was, tweet an answer to me. I'll check in nxt wk
Heidi moderating as Bob, Paul, & Matt gave us a sneak-peek. What's coming from Legendary Comics = COOL . I'll be tweeting again after #SDCC
Thank you to all our fans for an excellent day yesterday at #SDCC -- I look forward to reading the transcript from the Legendary Panel.
If you are at a con, especially #SDCC -- be sure to ask about how/when  they will be capping the lines for signings.
Some folks did not know the line would be capped for the signing yesterday? Unfortunately, Fire/Safety codes make this a necessary evil.
I gotta give this one to Mom, and not the guys. (Sorry, Mom wins.) http://t.co/Bc4Rdlw  &lt; Yea, #comicbooks = #epicwin #SDCC THANK YOU!
"REVEALED 1st 5 pages of FM's Holy Terror! http://t.co/66aEfID #SDCC #LegendaryReveals," @LegendaryNews | For Bob, Steve, Dick & Flint. -FM
Thanks for all messages / enthusiasm -- I love returning to comic books. Writing, drawing; heroEs, guns, gorgeous heroinEs...ALL COOL. √+
Oh, yes, #epicfail "...I love returning to comic books. Writing, drawing; heros, guns, gorgeous heroinEs...ALL COOL." --&gt; @agidgetwidget
See you all soon.... Be good.
Unfortunately, I cannot respond to anyone just yet and have to run. Hmmm, maybe I'll as @agidgetwidget to set me up on Formspring or Tumblr?
Thanks for all the messages and enthusiasm -- I love returning to comic books. Writing, drawing; heros, guns, gorgeous heroins...ALL COOL.
Hey, @agidgetwidget are you following @LegendaryNews yet? Some things in this world are just cool. And making comics is one of 'em. #SDCC
I'll be back on later this afternoon to check in. Thank you to @mrmarkmillar @BobSchreck for spreading the word.
I will be there. Get all the latest news about #SDCC and HOLY TERROR by following @LegendaryNews || oh, & the trailer http://t.co/fjWhpPs
Well, I guess you figured out I was kinda busy drawing this graphic novel, HOLY TERROR. Who's going to #SDCC ?
Haven't been on Twitter awhile and I guess I have missed a lot, eh?
Thanks again everybody. Be good.
@OneShotCrisis Right now.
Okay, okay, a few more....
Thanks everybody. We'll talk soon. It's been fun.
@KingFfree Not at all. This has been a ball.
@RobertCfrom48th The guy who drew it.
Regarding my Captain America's politics, he'd make our enemies cry. He, himself, would not.
I wish I could get to all of your questions but I can only take a few more.
@robocreep That would be telling.
@TheDude6196 I've already written more than a dozen. They got pictures in them.
@ycinar Absolutely. We're talking.
@NotNamedJohn Captain America. But I'd have to do him my way.
@CraigJLewis Yes.
@oyboy The way I'd do her.
@neilcameron Yes.
@emepitri Yes: DARK KNIGHT, BOY WONDER.
@gonzansa I love Superman. He just needs a swift kick in the butt.
@joek345 Best advice I have, "Find out what things really look like." Use any pencil that makes you comfortable. I recommend Number 2 or HB
@FUCK699 My money is on MARV. He doesn't fall down easy.
@lourdes_g I would happily revisit ELEKTRA if they let me do her right.
HOLY TERROR is written and penciled and mostly inked. It DOES NOT -- I repeat, DOES NOT -- feature Batman.
You won't have to wait long for XERXES but we're holding off until we're absolutely certain we can meet schedule. Issue 2 is nearly complete
@J0ELG Tough call. CASH is the man.
@JahFurry Great Question. Yes, I would.
I'm gonna do my best to answer questions, folks, but there's a lot coming in.
@WoNinjaPlease I'm finishing up the script on SIN CITY 2. I have not released the rights to anyone yet. I hope to have more news soon.
@djpharoh Because the little snot needs discipline. Why do you think he has to wear that outfit?
@JohnByrneSays John is a good friend and a top talent. I look forward to whatever he's up to.
Hello Twitter! I got half an hour, what do you got?
Okay, I'll be here around 9:30 PM EST. Looking forward to it.
Hello Twitterverse -- I thought I'd let you all know I'll be on Twitter tonight at 9 PM (EST) to answer questions if you got 'em...
Thank you all so much, this has been fun! I gotta go back to drawing people killing each other.

RT @aldorantes batman vs. al queda? is it dead?  /  HOLY TERROR is well in progress. It no longer features Batman. I have made up a new hero
