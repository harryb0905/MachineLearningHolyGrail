RT @TIDALHiFi - #TIDALXJackWhite concert streaming live TONIGHT, exclusively on http://t.co/vPfyNspMeK [Watch Jack’s Tidal X show tonight]
We are human (even Daft Punk ha). We aren't perfect - but we are determined. #TidalFacts
and to help artists give that to their fans over and over again…
Our actions will speak louder than words. We made Tidal to bring people the best experiences...
We have Tidal X - it supports artists by giving them a platform to connect with their most loyal fans. Tidal is for all. #Tidalfacts
My cousin just moved to Nigeria to discover new talent. Tidal is a global company.
Rich getting richer? Equity values... YouTube $390 billion. Apple $760 billion. Spotify $8 billion. Tidal $60 million. #TidalFacts
Tidal pays 75% royalty rate to ALL artists, writers and producers - not just the founding members on stage.
Indie artists who want to work directly w/ us keep 100% of their music. "If you don't want the CEOs all in the videos" haa #tidalfacts
….Tidal is where artists can give their fans more without the middlemen. #TidalFacts
We made Tidal for fans. We have more than just music. We have video, exclusive concerts, tickets for events early, live sports!...
There are many big companies that are spending millions on a smear campaign. We are not anti-anyone, we are pro-artist &amp; fan. #TidalFacts
We are here for the long haul. Please give us a chance to grow &amp; get better. #TidalFacts
The iTunes Store wasn't built in a day. It took Spotify 9 years to be successful…
Tidal is doing just fine. We have over 770,000 subs. We have been in business less than one month. #TidalFacts
Stream of consciousness coming in 5, 4, 3, 2… #TidalFacts
