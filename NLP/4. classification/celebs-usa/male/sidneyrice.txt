My favorite time of the year 🙌🏾. This has all the ingredients for a classic game. Time for a #CrownRoyalWaterBreak to hydrate, moderate and stay in the game. Who’s ready to watch history in the making? #ad https://t.co/dh4hpjvn3N
Do the @Saints win the Super Bowl again? I remember it all too well. Brett Favre, throws me, a South Carolina Receiver a pass on the last drive of the game that’s intercepted by a Saints defender. Same thing happened today.. Does history in fact do what we think?
It was a pleasure meeting all the 12s who showed up at the @American Express Experience on Sunday before the big game! Stop by before the next home game to meet #Seahawks legend and friend of mine, Walter Jones. Terms Apply. Learn more at https://t.co/SYJMu5FpXR #AmexLife https://t.co/wYKoAH34Ux

@VictorCorteeez I know him personally. He would never intentionally harm his child sir! He made his statement and I believe him.
@smokeater118 nope, he didn't. And it's about 1800. He should be because he is in charge of every single one.
Against it 100 percent!! 100!!! “@sjackson1271: @sportingnews @sidneyrice Has Sidney Rice spoken out against domestic violence?”
@VictorCorteeez @SandyMartin64 @DavidKyle702 @NFLonFOX innocent til? Shouldn't he  move to the side til we all get the facts right?
That's what his words were during the PC right? “@JakeCherski: @sidneyrice who got it wrong? Rog?”
@SandyMartin64 so everything is ok as long as you don't physically hurt someone?
@franklion2014 Black, White, Red, Blue, Green. Who cares about color... Two wrongs don't make a right. It's not about race!
@Rattledeth Have I disagreed with this way thinking once? Stop missing my point please!
Correct! So all should pay right? “@1purplehaze1: @sidneyrice @NFLonFOX happens on every level is every industry. You know that though...”
@ChrisGarcia403 I'm not forgetting that.. That's obvious.
@theTomMurray @NFLonFOX Nope! And he never should. Doesn't make what he has done right tho!
@stevens2678 you're missing the point son... That's never condoned!! Ever!! If he knew about it the action should have been taken then!
Idk.. The top guy knows tho! “@sgantzhorn1: @sidneyrice @truyetti Also...the player of the Panthers was found guilty by a judge..right?”
@cavschris @WillBrinson @blkmambaa_ bet you didn't know I watched my mother suffer for years.. Shhhh!!!
@sgantzhorn1 perfect example sir.. It is. And someone knew what happened. Someone like him! Is it ok for him to know and do nothing?
Please do! “@rfryan: @sidneyrice Boo the NFL players that are criminals”
Again.. Who controls that?? “@1purplehaze1: @sidneyrice @NFLonFOX and how many still have their jobs? Good try.”
@SandyMartin64 @NFLonFOX and those people suffered the consequences for their actions right?
Boo them too!! Facts first tho! Facts 1st!“@truyetti: @sidneyrice  how about boo the players for their actions #placetheblameintherightspot”
I know some people that got it wrong and don't have a job anymore. Does this mean it's ok to get it wrong? You gain 0 yards on an inc pass!
Boo this man... 👻
Yessirrr!! Me and a few of the boys. Stop by! “@JimmyDonDon: @sidneyrice you going to be there Saturday sir?”
You Shouldn't speak on something you don't know about or don't understand the culture of. Only a few know their responsibility! #cnnlive
