22 yrs ago today, I remember at soundcheck in ATL at The Point (inL5P) when news of Kurt's death hit. Heavy and sad day. #KurtCobain

Kind of embarrassing to tell all of your fans to watch it and then the network cuts half of the good talent cuz they need more "celebrity".
By the way, getting cut from the George Fest show on MTV and VH1 is so par for the course. Show the TV darlings. Not the ones that slayed.
