Wake me up when someone releases a "Hit Em Up" or "Ether" or even "Takeover". #Tupac #Nas #JayZ
Sorry but the @taylorswift13 and @katyperry fued is more intense than the Drake and Meek Mill beef. #Zzzzzzzz

@CoreoNews ok then. Honestly not the case, it was disappointing to see. That's all.
@CoreoNews because it doesn't matter WHO - point is take time out for fans,period. Whether you are a ball player, musician, actor  whatever
@JPokluda amen!
@BaltimoreBlake_ not really, just frustrating to see. I don't need the attn- but also feel like it's not right to do that.
Not saying names, because maybe I don't know the entire situation and I respect the organization, but it didn't look good.
I was at Cowboys game today &amp; witnessed a popular NBA player say "Naw" when asked by a soldier in uniform for a pic. Not cool to me.
@juliepilat Hey! Sorry just seeing this. Al Biernat's is really good! Tei-An is great Japanese! Now I'm hungry! Lol
If you give out candy corn, raisins or pennies tonight- you deserve the egging your house is going to get. #Halloween
Funny to me that some country fans r mad at @taylorswift13 4 goin "pop". Have u listened to "country" lately? Its all pretty much POP ANYWAY
@moneybadger5 felt compelled to write you. We ALL make mistakes, period. Learn from it, move on &amp; dont let it define you! Keep your head up!

Rihanna sick and cancels another show in Dallas. #thatsucks #getwell
Don't worry ladies, guys can fall victim too. Guy's can suffer from "Dicky Do"! It's when... well I'll let you put that sentence together.
"Booty Do" = when a girls stomach sticks out further than her booty do.
Well, spring is officially here- just saw WAY too much of some girl in short shorts and halter top with a severe case of "booty-do"! #stop
What kind of COWARD plants a bomb &amp; then RUNS away to watch innocent people get hurt or DIE! There is a special place in hell for you MF'er!
Prayers going out to Boston. This makes me sick.
Nothing I love more than proving people wrong. #dontbelievejustwatch #motivation

@jreich no doubt! And Johnny's version easily does. But like you said, it's all subjective and I FEEL that cover more than any other.
@EBUNC1 @jreich @MikeDanger989 great! But I don't think it's better.
@jreich respectfully disagree. Nothing matches the emotion and realness in that record that eerily relates to his life at THAT moment.
@jreich @MikeDanger989 easily. Name ONE that is better?
I would argue that Johnny Cash's cover of "Hurt" ... is the best cover song in history of music. Period. #music
I usually hate dialogue in songs. Not sure why it annoys me so bad. #music #petpeave
