A favorite quote from my interview w/ #Bush41 for #AccidentalPresidents ...  “It turned out, Truman did a fine job. Thank heavens. We all assumed we were training for the invasion of Japan. I always felt Harry saved our lives.”
I often get asked what I'm reading. Here is my answer from the past 3yrs. I've loved every minute of my time delving into what happened the 8 times history was changed by a heartbeat. #AccidentalPresidents is a story or trial and tragedy, but also a story of America's resilience https://t.co/GaZ6SuH71p

In February 1933, 9 days after the amendment's ratification, President-elect Roosevelt was nearly shot and killed during a speech in Miami. The assassin, Giuseppe Zangara, fired 15 shots in 5 seconds missing FDR and killing the mayor of Chicago. #AccidentalPresidents (3/3)
Nicknamed the "lame duck" amendment, it moved both dates. But, lesser known is that this same amendment also said that if the president-elect dies before taking the oath of office then the vice president elect becomes president at noon on January 20. 2/3 #AccidentalPresidents
Ever wonder why members of Congress are sworn in on January 3? Historically, they were sworn in on March 4, which was the same date as the presidential inauguration. Both dates changed in January 1933 when the 20th amendment was ratified. 1/3 #AccidentalPresidents
If #ISIS reconstitutes in #Raqqa there will be no YPG left to fight them. So, who does that leave us with? Who is on the list of skilled fighters that are geographically well-positioned, not aligned with any of our adversaries, &amp; apathetic about protection if they finish the job?

Maybe he can be arrested on his way to one of the summits and tried for war crimes. In 2011-12, his defenders/opportunists (e.g. @amhaykal ) used to say he is not the monster his father was. Turns out, that's true, he's much worse &amp; one of most brutal tyrants of past 100 yrs https://t.co/KFToKiiW0Y
There's a huge missed opportunity to involve the private sector in the stabilization effort in places like Raqqa. Lots of interest in the mission. On education, health, infrastructure, etc. the private sector is ready to help. Withdraw military &amp; u leave that on the table #Syria
The fight against ISIS is one of the most important and positive stories of counter-terrorism post-9/11. Why would we abandon this? The mission is clear, momentum on our side, and our very presence in #Syria curtails #Iran and #Assad (as well as #Russia) influence in the country.
The withdrawal from #Syria will prove to be one of the biggest mistakes of the past decade. We'll hand control of #Syria to #Iran, who already has Iraq and Lebanon. Likely Turkish assault on our Kurdish partners would mean if #ISIS reconstitutes we find absence of strong fighters
@PreetBharara @AAKnopf Legally Cool

Response to Assad's 5 years of chemical attacks is not just about #Syria, it is also about all the other tyrants who are trying to determine what they can do with impunity; it's about whether tough diplomatic words carry any weight
N. Korea poisoning family member at a Malaysian airport w/some kind of chemical agent; Russian assassination attempt w/poison in the UK; 5yrs of Assad chemical attacks on the Syrian people. Conclusion: International community seems uninterested in halting use of chemical weapons

Excellent piece by Mike Singh about leaning forward on #IranianProtests https://t.co/O5V4b57cgc
Regime in Iran can shut down signal, telegram, etc, but differently from 2009, the whole country is connected and they have a long list of other messaging apps to use. This time around it's much harder to win a game of technology wack-a-mole #IranianProtests
Still too early to make clear predictions in #Iranprotests. Green Revolution had solid 3 weeks of momentum before being effectively repressed. Watch the Bazaari class carefully. If they behave differently than '09, then this is truly something new
Sustained pressure on the regime in #Iran is key. Every day, every hour. There is no risk to nuclear negotiations this time around. As the regime moves to fire on the people, protestors will need assurances that world is watching &amp; not going to get distracted by Michael Jackson
A smart piece on #Iran. @ksadjadpour is among the best thinkers on all things related to Iran https://t.co/iF4EeWnOIc
Resorting to force carries much higher costs in today's social media environment than it did in 2009. It's an old tactic that they will deploy in a context they don't really understand and their risk of miscalculation is very high #Iranprotests https://t.co/Jv4gZKzeYm
One lesson from 1999 &amp; 2009 is to keep the intl attention on #Iranprotests as it gives protestors a sense of support &amp; momentum. This time around, story of internet access is totally different from Green revolution &amp; position of neighbors &amp; USG far more adversarial toward regime
In order for #Iranprotests to be successful, there will need to be real leaders to rally around as an alternative. Contagions can weaken the regime but without new leaders to rally around, a revolution might be easy to start, but it is harder to finish

There is a reason why #Rwanda nicknamed Former French President Mitterand "Mitterahamwe"... if u need an explanation, look up Interahamwe
On 20th anniversary of Rwanda genocide, would be good for French govt to explain why Agathe Habyarimana is living peacefully in its country
Baada ya miaka ishrini ni muhimu sana kwa kukumbuka watu wa #Rwanda wanaouuwa wakati wa genocide. Ninataka kutoa usalama kwa warwanda.

Biggest mistake that graduates can make is not realizing that they know more about tech than the people they’re working for #NewDigitalAge
Rafsanjani, Velayati, etc., sounds a lot like 2005. The people make a suggestion w/their votes and then regime picks someone very different
Those who make big deal about significance of #Rafsanjani entering #Iran prez race, run risk of sounding like a character from groundhog day
I reserve judgment on what any of recent candidacy announcements in #Iran mean until Guardian Council disqualifies most of them this week
@carolinejeba thank you so much. I am really glad you are enjoying it. Tell your friends to get a copy too!

Re: my last tweet, I met a person in Guatemala City, who was extorted by an inmate w/a smuggled phone in an LA prison #NewDigitalAge
Many prison inmates have smuggled phones; maybe those who r physically incarcerated should also be virtually incarcerated #NewDigitalAge
To those who put unborn child's sonogram online, at least wait until the child is born and can consent w/a quasi grin or opening of eyes
In our book @ericschmidt &amp; I say parents need 2 talk privacy/security before birds &amp; bees. What does that convo sound like? #NewDigitalAge
@MollyRingwald how do I follow-up w/you on the question of how parents have the privacy/security conversation? I have ideas on this
@BrookeGeahan @ericschmidt @MollyRingwald You are most welcome!

@mosharrafzaidi just checking in :)
@ianbremmer I just learned from @Nouriel that you used to be a stand-up comedian. I love it! #learningnewthingsaboutyourfriends
Some kind of intervention in #Syria requires real incentives (border, refugee flows, PKK concerns) and no election year; #Turkey fits both
I remain convinced that ultimately #Turkey will be the gamechanging factor in #Syria, not Kofi Annan
During my recent trip to #Kyrgyzstan, govt played the press in soccer. I asked, what position does the PM play &amp; was told forward, of course
@blakehounshell absolutely. My view has been that #Turkey most likely to intervene, although I thought it'd be caused by more refugee flows

Iran's next presidential elections exactly 1 year away and the regime needs a bargaining chip to ease sanctions, so why not pretend to talk?
Just returned from a very insightful trip to #Afghanistan, #Pakistan, and #Kyrgyzstan
The new round of nuclear talks with #Iran feels like a bad case of groundhog day to me, where the regime lies, cheats, and plays for time

I'm following @BigAlBrand who has good tweets and insights from on the ground in #Homs #Syria
Russia and China veto #Syria resolution; now what?
I wish the tough rhetoric we are hearing right now on #Sryia was used on the regime in #Iran in June 2009; regime there is no less brutal
Lavrov saying UNSCR not balanced enough on #Syria and that the violence is being fomented by opposition groups. Sounds like #Syria TV
The #HomsMassacre still underway, 260 people dead; any UNSC resolution other than a chapter 7 intervention is useless
Please RT widely the commentary, photos, and videos under #HomsAttack
More than 230 people killed today in #homs, worst single day massacre in #syria since 1982. I'm told another 700-800 injured
Having a productive offsite with the @googleideas team today
At what point does the non-Allawite contingent of #Assad's military start planning for their future? #Syria

@Princessssss shukran ketiir; corrections always useful, and counter arguments are always welcomed :) I do read what people tweet @ me
@Princessssss u r correct on the stats, I was looking at casualties (wounded) stats; anyway, point is still the same about inconsistency
@andrewchappelle don't know exact figures in #Bahrain, but my point is the inconsistency
And for what it is worth, Walid Muallim should be put on trial
GCC sent troops to #Bahrain where 100s were being killed, but sent monitors who "left in protest" to #Syria where 6,000+ people have died
@toluogunlesi Yes, there were 6 former Nigerian violent extremists (Christian and Muslim) at our summit, they are the face of anti-extremism

In Zurich reflecting on an amazing week in #Tunisia and #Libya; tremendous admiration for the people in both countries
My friend @ksadjadpour makes an important point that for #Iran, closing the straight of #hormuz works better as a threat than a reality
Next time I'm in #Tunisia, I want to visit #Sidibouzid
I stand corrected, 36 people dead today in #Syria, one-third of which were in Homs; this is a tragic daily narrative #basharcrimes
While Bashar al-Assad is the face of #Syria regime, I'm not convinced a deal that puts his VP in power removes the circle of influence
I'm struggling to understand what the Arab League does, since "observing" and "monitoring" in #Syria is accompanied by another 26 deaths

Also had fascinating 3 days in #Libya last week, where after 42yrs of totalitarianism, they have chance to build governance from scratch
Eager for #tunisian tweeters to share what is on their mind as I go into meetings w/govt, civil society, and private sector
So excited to be in #Tunisia, first time in country since revolution. I arrive here w/such admiration for what Tunisians have done
I highly recommend following U.S. Ambassador to Russia @mcfaul who is one of the smartest and most creative thinkers in U.S. foreign policy
24 people killed in #Syria today as #Arab League "observes" and "fact finds"

@Q8Dot shukran ketiir
@Q8Dot and what are the feelings towards the royals? Is it like Jordan and stops at the King, or like Bahrain and includes the King?
Immunity for #Saleh will be deal breaker for protestors in #Yemen; I'm skeptical of Feb. 21 elections, not that I have a better idea
@Q8Dot I agree, I'd also like to see Kuwaiti government have more women in parliament; I met some very inspiring candidates in Kuwait City
@ianbremmer although if they closed the shopping malls, we would see hoards of young men in the streets of Kuwait City
Everything about #Yemen makes me nervous right now
So the #Kuwait government resigned. I'm glad it was just the cabinet & not the 80% of population that works for the public sector
The @SyrianSitin is another example of activists using free platforms to apply newer tools (YouTube) w/traditional tactics (Sit-ins) #Syria
I like what I'm hearing thus far from #Egypt, but the elections are a 5 month process, so it is a marathon, not a sprint #wait&see
Brainstorming w/@jscarpenter11 in the @googleideas huddle
Just because #Saleh "transferred" power in #Yemen does not mean all is well; huge portions of the country remain ungoverned
@Nouriel when are u back in NY?
Am now following @RonanFarrow who I should have been following all along! One of my most inspirational friends
.@blakehounshell whether Saleh signs or not, #Yemen crisis is still in early stages, hard to imagine stability there
33 dead, 1500 injured in #Egypt since Saturday
@Ed_Husain agree re: #Syria, although sectarian issues there will be far worse, which I think you also agree with
Is anyone surprised that military held on to power in #Egypt? 60 yrs of control isn't just relinquished, especially when they have the guns
@DavidKenner Ahhhh, gotcha, all good :)
@DavidKenner not sure what that has to do with politics or administration (especially since I worked in both), it is a simple fact
There are lots of examples of revolutions that succeeded in overthrowing a govt, but very few that succeeded in forming a new one #Egypt

I'm curious what a map of illicit resource flows (drugs, arms, funds, trafficked people) would look like b/t/w North Korea, #Iran, & #Syria
It's been less than 24 hours since Arab League and #Syria regime reached agreement; #Bashar's regime has already killed 12 more people
@SultanAlQassemi I will read it
@blakehounshell do u ever come up to NY?
Always learn a lot when getting together w/@ianbremmer ... One of my favorite big thinkers
Trying to figure out which has more credibility: #syria's deal w/the Arab League or Mugabe's commitment to free and fair elections in Zim
Finally the Turkish government acknowledging that "#Bashar is just like his father #hafez." #Syria
The idea of #Syria state-run TV releasing breaking news is funny; well since it is just about the least credible source, I mean propaganda
Does the world have more corruption & scandal today, or does the spread of technology make it more visible and harder to get away with?
I have no confidence in the Arab League's deal w/the regime in #Syria. Dictators play for time, then lie, and cheat until they get caught
After more than 60 dead this wknd in #Syria, Arab League's Nov. 2nd meeting will say a lot about the role it wants to play in the region
@ianbremmer what do you think the 7 billionth person's name will be?
@BarryPavel well said :)
@BarryPavel I hope, we need Damascus and Aleppo to tip though and they are still holding firm
If #bashar falls in #syria, it will change the game in the region: #Iran, #Lebanon, #hezbollah, #Hamas, #PIJ, #Iraq
More international rhetoric calling for #bashar to step down in #syria is needed from neighboring Arab states + Turkey
Persistence of #Syria demonstrators continues. Wondering how long #bashar can hold on to Damascus and Allepo
Looking forward to welcoming the 7 billionth person to earth on Monday

Good evening @mercycorps and Portland, Oregon ... Looking forward to speaking w/all of u about the digital disruption in just a few minutes
Btw, maybe collaboration of Mexican drug cartels w/#Iran has implications for whether they r "cartels" or "terrorists", similar attributes
Hezbollah active in tri-border area in South America, but clearly #Iran's Qods forces are reaching further and wider than we thought
IRGC in #Iran doesn't operate quasi-autonomously like ISI in #Pakistan, very difficult to imagine Khamanei was in the dark on terror plot
Foiled #Iran terror plot resembles the #Iran of mid-80s to mid-90s ... Remember Beirut and Buenos Aires
Qods Force / Mexican drug cartel collaboration makes me nervous about how #Iran could leverage illicit networks to smuggle WMD
What I find interesting about #iran terror plot is they didn't plan 2 orchestrate through hezbollah as proxy, but rather mexican drug cartel
@JeremyBarnicle @mercycorps great brainstorming with you all and the team over lunch. I'm excited about all the overlap

@blakehounshell I would agree with you on that as well, all speculation from my side and 3 clerics can lead to a hunch, but not a conclusion
@blakehounshell I disagree; my view is Allawites have made the calculation that Assad is done and are starting to hedge for Sunni govt
If Allawite clerics r speaking out against Bashar, maybe a post-Assad #Syria won't be the sectarian conflict some suggest. Hard to tell.
@blakehounshell I would say more than interesting; this is the first I have heard of his own sect speaking out against him, ever.

Assad engaged in protracted warfare against people of #Syria, except his people are unarmed, so w/2500+ dead, "murder" is more accurate
With Bashar al-Assad soon to be gone, who will #Iran turn to for funneling weapons, resources to #Hezbollah, #Hamas, #PIJ, #Al-AqsaMB?

Dear media, if u want to honor bravery of our SEALS, stop running through all of the tactics they used & specific intel collected #dangerous
Very curious where the ISI and Pakistani Police were during #Osama bin Laden's move-in day to his mansion right next door to a military camp
EU imposed sanctions on 13 #Syria officials, but not #Bashar; kind of defeats the purpose; at least #RamiMakhlouf is on it #basharcrimes

Does anyone have data around how uprisings in #bahrain have impacted islamic banks?
In '04-'06 parents told their kids to stay out of politics in #syria, now parents & kids are joining together in dissent against #bashar
The facade of depoliticization I saw when I traveled to #syria in '04-'06 has been exposed &  true sentiments of dissent are there to stay
Al-Qaeda's broad and weak calls to action are reflective of an organization that is lost and holding on to a declining trademark of terror
Even if #bashar stays in power, he has lost #syria ... Once dissent unleashed, you can't fully put it back in the box #weakerbashar
Is Sheikh Nasser replacing Sheikh Salman as the new heir apparent in #bahrain? If true, major implications for reform & sunni-shi'a dialogue
I'm still amazed that #Osama Bin Laden was only 30miles outside of Islamabad
Not truly accurate to call Rami Makhlouf a businessman; he's more like an all-powerful young Mafia don #Syria #BasharCrimes
Rami Maklouf can reach directly into #Syria judicial system: Ex. #Syria MP got 5yr sentence to jail just for criticizing #SyriaTel
Speaking of #RamiMakhlouf, is he still in Dubai watching his $$ being used to kill people in #Daraa, while he sips a Martini at Buddah Bar?
The corruption of #RamiMakhlouf is a big part of every life lost in #Syria #BasharCrimes
@ianbirrell @AlecJRoss I agree, I asked the question b/c Sub-Saharan African conflicts don't seem to mobilize Twitteratti #TwitteratiFail
#Bashar al-Assad perpetrates the crimes, #RamiMakhlouf, the corrupt SyriaTel owner, finances them; $ + Tanks/helos = #BasharCrimes
By May 1, 1994, 300,000 people already dead in #Rwanda, I wonder if world would have been silent if Twitter was around back then

Enjoyed watching the Bangels and PS 22 chorus sing "walk like an egyptian" on 30yr anniversary of the song (cc: @chatkoff @TribecaFilmFest)
Love being here for @janetripro and @chatkoff vision of @TribecaFilmFest on the 10yr anniversary, wonderful & inspiring

@kennedypj thank u very much, that would be great!
@piersmorgan as I deal w/a full day of @Delta errors today, I am reminded of your wonderful dinner story
Does anyone have a senior-level contact at Saudi Airlines?
When I lived in #syria, the youth I met in Deir-e Zur told me their dream was a country where #Assad fell from power & stood trial
Are connection technologies better for dictators or dissent? #Syria suggests the latter: http://wapo.st/dLqO23”
@seedsown tell me more
People power gets activists into the streets; tech ensures what they do when they get there doesn't happen in isolation #Syria
Technology being used by dissidents to end decades of isolation in #syria http://wapo.st/dLqO23
@ginab put tools in the hands of people and keep an international spotlight on Damascus so #Bashar + thugs are accountable #Syria
The number of protesters in #Syria as well as cities with protests continues to grow; demonstrations have lasted one month
Amazing resilience of #Syria people; when I lived there for part of 2005, nobody dared criticize #Bashar in public; times have changed
Looking forward to judging @TribecaFilmFest for my third year this week, I always learn a lot from the docs
President Salah of #Yemen, may find that antagonizing the women of his country could prove fatal to his regime
Bashar al-Assad says he will lift emergency laws, taking a page out of Ben Ali's book of bad tricks for failure #syria

Violence in #Syria #Bahrain both exacerbated by #Iran; in #Syrian Tehran funds the regime; in #Bahrain they fund the opposition
Bashar al-Assad confirming what we already knew; he is among the most ruthless of all his colleagues #Syria
22 unarmed civilians murdered in #Syria today. Scores more injured. Security forces opened fire on protestors.
#FF @AlecJRoss @Elise_Jordan @mstepka @SlaughterAM

Enjoying a nice day by the pool with my grandparents, so great to see them
I enjoy reading @weddady tweets sharing his perspective on events in MENA
Just arrived in West Palm Beach, so excited to see my grandparents
Is anyone on the ground in Deir-e Zur? I haven't been able to get a handle on what the current dynamics are in the province #Syria
If anyone in the mainstream media cares, Bashar al-Assad is still killing his own people (cc: @cnn @bbc @cbs @nytimes @wsj) #Syria
@illoydwebber happy birthday
Meeting former Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz for lunch to talk about issues related to corruption and violent extremism
Bashar al-Assad's speech was the usual garbage of "reforms will come, but they have to come slowly" ... #Syria people not buying it
What happens next in #Lebanon will be heavily influenced by what happens in #Syria #Hezbollah
The fact that "vast majority" of #Libya rebels are "doctors, lawyers, etc." is unconvincing ... Ayman al-Zawahiri is a surgeon
I've been watching the news all evening, no mention of #Syria or the arrest of @mahmood in #Bahrain; all #Libya
In addition to the al-Assad regime's brutality towards its own people, it also partners w/ #Iran to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, & PIJ #Syria
@minsd "western educated" seems to be a label we give to people who speak good English as opposed to when they espouse democratic values
@ElizabethAyoub I'm not yet comparing this to Hama, my point is Bashar grew-up in a family responsible for Hama #Syria
When I lived in #Syria for part of '04/'05, most anti-Al-Assad sentiments I heard were in Deir-e Zur; curious what people are hearing now?
Hafez al-Assad killed 20,000 of his own people in Hama in Feb. '82; the "western educated" Bashar is just the next chapter #Syria
If Bashar al-Assad lifts 50-year old emergency law in #Syria, will it be too little too late like Ben Ali's "hail mary" pass?
The lack of coverage on #Syria only makes it easier for Bashar al-Assad to brutally crack-down on his people; like father, like son
Syriatel, which is controlled by Bashar Al-Assad's cousin Rahmy Maklouf, is a target of protestors; follow the $$ trail #Syria
The level of violence and number of protestors murdered in #Syria is being lost in the midst of #Libya coverage
#Zimbabwe's Minister of Information was "western educated" and infamously declared that the 6mm non-Zanu-PF supporters should be wiped out
And let's not forget that Saif al-Islam was "western educated" ... and then called for the massacre of his people in #Libya
People who call Bashar Al-Assad "western educated" too often ignore the education he received from his father #Syria
World leaders should not be fooled by Mr. & Mrs. Al-Asaad's savvy about how to present themselves as "reformers" #Syria
What happens in northeastern #Syria could have important implications for what neighbors do vis-a-vis #Syria #Kurds
2 days ago, 100 people were killed in Dara, #Syria and still no widespread attention
Granted Ba'ath Party will be replaced by more Ba'ath party in #Syria, but still mass cabinet resignation is noteworthy
It looks like today is a bad day to be Bashar al-Assad as the #Syria cabinet resigns amidst the protests
I look forward to response from @saudi_airlines  Interesting that they can respond to tweets about fares, but not losing peoples' belongings
Dear @Saudi_Airlines , you lost my luggage 2 months ago and have done nothing to reimburse, track it down, or help. cc: @piersmorgan

Enjoying a good dinner chat about the state of the world w/ @piersmorgan
I will give Richard Engel real credit, he is bravely doing what he can to get the story out #Libya
Just had a great meeting w/former President Bush in Dallas, interesting chat about civic empowerment, social justice, & education
Why is the media not covering #Syria? Oh wait, revolution A.D.D
What happens in #Yemen if/when President Salah falls? Lots of people thinking about this, haven't heard many ideas though
Just landed in #Dallas
My favorite tweet of the day: "All joking Assad, can anyone name a demonstrator he has released?" (via @PTSDandYou) #Syria
@captainlarab it was a rhetorical question; obviously there are names of rebels, but most people can't name any #Libya
Or, can anyone name a rebel leader on the ground in #Libya? Anyone?
Can anyone name an opposition leader on the ground in #Libya?
Spoke to my parents today, who love seeing @SlaughterAM on TV every night.  Was an honor to work for such a creative mind! #networkedworld
Assad claims he has released all demonstrators arrested this past week. I recall Mubarak saying the same thing in #Egypt #Syria

Reforms have most credibility when leaders announce and implement them pre- as opposed to post-demonstrations. #democracy
#Syria regime's pledge to reform has no credibility; Bashar al-Assad routinely promises and punts reforms
Headed to Dallas right now. This will be my first trip to the city, hello #Dallas

While #Gaddafi's lunacy makes for good jokes, we should not lose sight of lengths to which he will go to in order to maintain power #Libya
@netfreedom thx for sharing, missed this today. I heard the same thing is happening in #Syria, but w/bloggers supporting revolutions abroad
As Saif al-Islam illustrated this week, being fluent in English & heir apparent to a dictator doesn't make you a reformist #Libya #gaddafi
Worth noting that many jihadist websites have struggled to account for & explain these secular MENA revolutions in their propaganda
I'm curious how people in Zimbabwe are reacting to events in MENA & I'm curious if anyone in North Korea even knows it is going on
To everyone who said Saif al-Islam would be a reformer post #Gaddafi, I hope u took notice of him declaring war on his own people #Libya
Telling that #Gaddafi seems to have no invitations for exile; 42yrs of brutality, terror, & human rights violations #Libya

People in #Egypt know that if looting, etc. turns to anarchy, they could lose harmony of their cause; response = neighborhood watch groups
Early in protests, I saw the people directing safe traffic; now we know they have developed neighborhood watch groups #jan25 #Egypt

There is no single profile of a demonstrator in Egypt; those involved are politically, religiously, and socio-economically diverse
It will be key to watch whether or not a riff develops between the #Egypt army & the Ministry of Interior as situation continues to decline
@rafik I agree
Leaderless element of #tunisia #egypt makes protests highly democratic, but also means vacuum that could result in non-democratic outcome
I heard from Egyptians: tech makes weak ties stronger, links people in/out country, allows organizing in advance of total shutdown #jan25
Every Egyptian I talked to on ground this week laughed when I told them some think tech was not a vital tool for organizing #jan25
Interesting how at no point have there been counter-protests despite Egypt's political diversity, just all people vs. police #jan25
A few days ago, saw protestors in Cairo both demonstrating and directing traffic to help Egyptians & foreigners get around safely #jan25
Fears in #Egypt of what could happen if the army fractures

Tensions high in Lebanon in what seems like a dangerous every couple yrs pattern; will hezbollah show restraint in face of indictments?
Headed to Washington, DC to meet my new nephew, 2 days old and 9+ lbs!
Going on BBC at 9pm EST to talk about #Tunisia
@rafik nobody is disputing this
@UzoAfriqion thx so much.  I can't wait to travel to DC and meet my new nephew
Congratulations to my sister! I am officially an uncle and couldn't be happier about it
Anyone have the photo described by @nytimes of Tunisian activist holding sign saying "yes we can" w/the twitter hashtag also on the sign?
@sharmeenagangat agreed, that's why I say tech doesn't choose sides, people do and they are responsible for it being violent or non-violent
To Skeptics like Gladwell: nobody claiming tech caused revolution, but rather relevance of tool in connecting offline movement w/world
#Tunisia shows how tech can be a meaningful compliment to, but not replacement for, sustained offline protests; both important
@netfreedom I agree, my point is tech creates an external audience that helps apply global pressure
Lesson from #Tunisia, even if tech largely blocked, demonstrates power of collective and offers external megaphone for local activists
Tech is an important tool, but change requires individuals who are willing to take that step, which makes the difference #Tunisia
tech creates space for activists to find unlikely supporters & amplify their cause; ask #BenAli if that matters, if u can find him
I wonder how many Twitter users knew who #BenAli was and where #Tunisia was located before today. #relevanceoftech
Tech links #tunisia activists w/the rest of the world; #BenAli flees #Tunisia
To those who question the role that tech plays as a tool for change, watch events in #Tunisia: http://tinyurl.com/6gtef3d

The Burj Dubai is so unbelievably tall
@Padmasree it is time for a warrior reunion
Follow the amazing work of my friend @MaajidNawaz who is working on youth empowerment in Pakistan #IYCF2010
Hello Dubai!
@NateBeachW yes, that's about right
Just explored Kibero with a friend of mine who worked on health issues in the community a few yrs ago
Learning a tremendous amount about the fiber that will be brought to Somalia in the next several months, headed to Dubai later today
Headed to Loodariak, the Maasai village where I spent many summers researching Maasai socialization youth, first trip since 2006
Somalia is the biggest exporter of camels in the world, underscores importance of keeping livestock healthy
Loved visiting the Kenya ihub today, great incubation model @Pierre @kenyapundit @ushahidi
@souktel wow, how do I learn more, can u send me a link or provide a POC?
Met w/Somali hawalas, which are the informal banks built around trust. Fascinating to hear the mechanics of how it works
Did u know there is an app for Somali phones where job seekers / employers can send/receive resumes by sms?
@cash_warren we will add it to our next lunch agenda
Somalia's Golis Telecom has one of the cheapest international calling rates on the planet, at less than $0.2 anywhere in the world
Learned today that Somalia has the highest average length cell phone conversations in the world: 132 minutes
Meeting of Somali carriers today was first all-inclusive meeting to take place since 2006, positive sign of what they can do as a collective
Great way to expand mobile $ and stop illicit flow of funds at the same time
Interesting how if carriers want to scale mobile $ transfers, they need to meet a certain standard on anti-money laundering
@jess I did and it appears they are as it could help solve for the non inter-operability problem between the carriers.
Somali carriers are doing tons of work on women's empowerment, I'm getting briefed by Hormud tmrw to learn more
Participating in roundtable w/Somali telecoms, hawalas, and TFG ... Lots of consensus about the central role telecom is playing in Somalia
Just had a fascinating lunch w/Somali telecoms and learned about their innovative work and challenges
@Pullman b/c so much displacement Somalia, Telesom providing platforms for internal remittances b/t/w north and south of Somalia
Africa has fastest mobile phone growth rate in the world at 58%
Just met Telesom, who are doing mobile money for 20% of their 500,000 users in Somalia, looking to scale-up
29 million dollars a day are transferred by mobile phones in Kenya
