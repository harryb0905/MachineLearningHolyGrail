@mellotwj 4 - And if you disappeared so would every light // What if there were no stars, no headlights in cars, every city light in the dark all flickered out black and they never came back?? // XO
@mellotwj 3 - You're a supernova galaxy that could never burn out even if you burned out // And baby I already know what would happen if I let you go // My universe would explode // Every second without your love it's a black world // It's a black world without you...
@mellotwj 2 - What if there was no sun, no morning ever gonna come, no songbirds singing songs? Every second without your light it's a black world // It's a black world without you // You're brighter than a Vegas street // Even brighter when you're next to me....
@mellotwj Thanks for wanting to know them! 1 - Black is not a color, it's the absence of light // The sun's not just a lover, it's the absence of the night // What if there were no stars, no headlights in cars, every city light in the dark all flickered out black and they never came back.

Listen to my song for @Bourdain on @iTunes here:  Bourdain - Single by Jason Reeveshttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bourdain-single/1401046398 https://t.co/Tnx6KSEf0a
When @anthonybourdain died i had no idea how to react. He inspired me in so many ways and through his show he somehow felt like a friend. Listen to my tribute song to him on @Spotify now:  https://t.co/oZdxXdxCm7
@loganhorton719 Soon and yes!
@EvynRynee @Bourdain Thank you for listening // XO
@ashleyalong ❌⭕️❤️
When @Bourdain died I had no words for how it made me feel. And I had no idea a week later or so a song for him would fall out of the universe. But life is strange and unexpected and surreal. Here’s a preview of a song for one of my heroes. Coming soon // XO https://t.co/noXviS1Re2
@elijahnoll @gnash 🙏🏼💛 🙏🏼
@DigiFarmAnimals @gnash Mad love!! 🐷 ❤️ 🐽
Today is devastating // @Bourdain taught us much more than food and travel // He taught us the importance of connection and getting outside of our comfortable little boxes // His show has inspired me for years and will continue to do so // I only wish he could keep making more..
Very stoked to have been a part of this one // Check out the new @gnash single “Imagine If” // @DigiFarmAnimals + The Six   https://t.co/2X6WNQBMmP
I’m about 2 songs away from finishing this new album and it comes out immediately after they’re done // No hype // No bullshit // Just free flow love energy // Here’s one of the new ones // I wrote it with the magical @alysavanderheym // XO  w h o  y o u  a r e  💙 https://t.co/SNVVjotxZZ
@HeatherBritt25 ❤️⚡️❤️
@LlelaMadriz24 3/3 - We were just casualties of a sea that threw us storms until we sunk // I was never gonna blame it on us // CHORUS // And I know it wasn’t my fault but I can’t help but feel responsible // XO
@LlelaMadriz24 2/3 -  Sometimes hearts fight like a tiger you tried taming // Even wildfires lose light and start fading // Sometimes love dies and you try but you can’t save it // Sometimes love dies // No I’m not gonna say we lost trust // I was never gonna blame it on us..
@LlelaMadriz24 1/2 - I could tell when you told me goodnight // what you really meant to say was goodbye // I could see all the pain in the way you couldn’t look me in my eyes // what you really meant to say was goodbye // Cause sometimes love dies and you try but you can’t save it...
@LlelaMadriz24 Thanks for listening!! Here they are..
@anatividad86 ❤️⚡️🌴

@LlelaMadriz24 BRIDGE: I feel better now that you're gone away from me // I feel better now that you're gone // I feel better knowing you're not the one for me // I feel better now that you're gone // XO - Thanks again for listening!!
@LlelaMadriz24 V2: Living with a fake romantic // I was tryna fall in love but // You were taking it too tragic // Always tryna mess things up // And careful is an awful feeling when you just wanna be wild // You were always in between and I was outside but // CHORUS
@LlelaMadriz24 CHORUS: Ever since you left, since you left I've been feeling fine // Didn't just forget you I swept you out of my mind and I know it'll break your heart if you see me smiling this hard // But ever since you left, since you left everything is going right
@LlelaMadriz24 Here they are!!  V1: I've been feelin' way too dark and you've been getting way too high so I started holding my guitar to get away from your vibe // And lonely is an awful feeling when you're not really alone // I was staring at the ceiling wishing you'd go cause

@realjasonrak It’s capo on 5 - F, C, G, Am. // Thanks again for listening and wanting to play it!
@realjasonrak 5 / Staring at the phone just wishing someone else was home // CHORUS // — // Thank you very much for listening // XO
@realjasonrak 4 / Weaving like lines that you drew in silence while your Gould and Bernstein vinyl played // Listening to every mark they made // CHORUS // And I wonder, what would men do without women? Would we live in caves and go for days without a shave just watching television all alone..
@realjasonrak 3 / They sound like a symphony // I chased that sheep all the way out to Hokkaido but couldn’t find a thing anywhere and I felt so alone so I traveled back to Tokyo to walk those neon streets //
@realjasonrak 2 / Murakami, you paint real life on a snow-white empty page // Like origami, you fold your light in a brand new ancient way // And I know your pen is mightier than a samurai sword a diamond sharpened // Murakami, your words inspire from an island far away..
@realjasonrak 1 / Murakami // I found you today // While I was reading Patti Smith and she mentioned your name // So I drove to the store and I bought a copy of The Wind-Up Bird and let it rain down like Japan // Sippin sencha on a train to Kyoto on Saturday wandering through the Fushimi Gates
@realjasonrak Thanks for listening!! I’ll write them out here // Much love

@cameatlast ..The universe is a work of art // And I'm just a single drop of paint, infinite I am, fading out I ain't // CHORUS // I'm just a single drop of paint, infinite I am, fading out I ain't // XO
@cameatlast .. It's youth that we crave when we open our eyes and the lines on our face paint proof of a wasted life // CHORUS // And I still feel deep in my heart, I'm just a kid scared of the dark // But when I look beyond the stars...
@cameatlast .. (V2) I realize that age is just an outer reflection of the light we've got in our soul // And life is a road that travels in two directions: rusted and painted gold // What is a life if we only get high cause we hate what we do but we still wanna fly? ..
@cameatlast ..It's youth that we crave when we open our eyes and the lines on our face paint proof of a wasted life // If I ever grow up I'm gonna grow high, I'll fly, but I'm never gonna grow old // It's too little too late the day that we die, that's why I'm never gonna grow old // ...
@cameatlast When I'm 93 I'll have the skin of a shipwreck and the soul of an evergreen // My body will break down but I'll keep it kickin' as long as I'm chasing dreams // What is a life if we work till we die and we hate what we do but we've gotta get by // ...
@cameatlast First of all, thank you both for listening!! I'll type them out in these comments. Much love!! XO // XO

Actually, #SongsAreSilentFilms is still up. It's just #TheLovesick &amp; #CagedBirdsSetFree that are down. Uploading them as we type!!
@JustCallMeET Totally agreed! It's an evil business for sure. But the art is worth it!
@silucre Sadly it's a music business BS thing. I had no control, but still own the songs so I can re-load them. And I'm doing that now!
@MarieLee_Louise It was actually a music business BS thing and I couldn't stop it. Will be ok soon!
@preshpresh I know!! I'm getting them back up right now and will let you know once those sites have processed them! XO
@JustCallMeET It was music business BS actually, and I couldn't stop it from happening. Good thing is I own them and can put them back up!

@KhyleDeen @NellyJoyMusic @HighDiveHeart Thank you for those amazing words!! XO
@TheHaltertops Thanks Hannah!! I'll get them back it's just a bummer.
@JustCallMeET Yes I'm sorry about that!! I'm working on getting them back up today and then it is just a matter of them processing them!!
@MarieLee_Louise You're right, but it's still a shame. Thanks!!
@nujj98 Neither can I. Hopefully there will be a @HighDiveHeart show of some kind soon!! XO
It was completely out of my hands and I'm working quick to fix it. The list includes #TheLovesick #CsgedBirdsSetFree &amp; #SongsAreSilentFIlms

"Blindness" by the dude @jtimberlake - Snowflakes. Countryside. Clouds with actual emotion. Slow drive.
@maykathleen_ @bjamesmusic It was amazing for sure. And thank you very much!!
@maykathleen_ @bjamesmusic That's my favorite one. Crazily I walked into Blue's studio as they were listening to that song while recording.
@fibri13 @bjamesmusic @mikalblue I think Brendan is making more music right now but I'm talking about an old record I love.
This cold morning I'm listening to the warmth of the first @bjamesmusic record, produced by the wondrous @mikalblue - Still golden.
@Dave_Bowen And I know there are much easier ways to do it I just like the zen vibe of slowly erasing unnecessary background
@Dave_Bowen I usually cut a rough circle around the person then after I paste it I erase the remaining surrounding.
She sat relaxed as the strobe light storm sky rolled in and enveloped her. Cigarette lit, dangling from her thin drenched fingers.
@Dave_Bowen I'm not sure what you mean by that?

@HanhSouLo Thank you for your beautiful concern. Love to you. I am patient.
@LadCry @fhnixon @taylorswift13 Yes, but Spotify makes billions and pays songwriters almost nothing. That is the problem. Nothing else.
@RawanElMasri I don't have any more time to explain this to you. Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about. Again, all love to you.
@RawanElMasri In this case, Spotify is taking the fans money and keeping most of it for themselves. There is the greed.
@RawanElMasri Clearly you're not understanding me. I am not blaming fans. I am blaming a big corporation for not paying the musicians.
@JustCallMeET I'm so sorry to hear that Erin. So much love to you. And thank you for listening to my songs. ((xo))
@RawanElMasri All I have is love for every music listener out there, including you.
@RawanElMasri In no way am I greedy, it's about the principle of Spotify paying songwriters essentially nothing for their music.
@RawanElMasri And since being a musician and songwriter is my job, I do care when people stop paying me anywhere near a reasonable rate.
@RawanElMasri First of all, this has nothing to do with fans. I love fans. It's only about the big companies not paying the musicians.
@Futur3Words @fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 If more people are listening than ever, why should the creators get paid almost nothing?
@Futur3Words @fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 Yes they do but the people making the music are getting paid less than ever.
@LadCry @fhnixon Not at all. Listeners are the most important part of it all. Only love..
@Futur3Words @fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 And there is nothing selfish about us not wanting music as an art form to be devalued.
@Futur3Words @fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 What I said has nothing to do with music listeners, who I love, just the big companies.
@Futur3Words @fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 I want everybody to hear the music, but Spotify is making crazy money and not paying us.
@Futur3Words @fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 This is only about the art of songwriting and music making not being devalued.
@ColbieCaillat @NellyJoyMusic My favorite people too!! ((xo))
@LadCry @fhnixon @taylorswift13 And I personally want everyone to be able to hear whatever songs they want, it just shouldn't be free.
@LadCry @fhnixon @taylorswift13 If Spotify paid the songwriters even a barely decent rate, it would be different.
@LadCry @fhnixon @taylorswift13 It isn't about the fans using the service, it's about the company not paying the songwriters/musicians.
@RawanElMasri @taylorswift13 By they I mean Spotify. And I don't want anyone to buy every album, I just don't want everybody to buy none.

@LynetteDubovik I agree!!
@Mollee921 @danilupton @taylorswift13 ((xo))
@danilupton @taylorswift13 I buy all my music, and always have. I don't stream.
@danilupton @taylorswift13 Probably so, but when your devalue something as important as music, it becomes a real problem for everyone.
@JuanManuelPast1 @taylorswift13 I love that the music is available to everyone, but Spotify is getting rich from ads and paying us nothing.
@thaswatfredsaid Thank you Fred! Hopefully before too long. All love.
@fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 I love @ColbieCaillat and all the songs we've written together. Thank you for loving them too!
@fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 Thank you very much for that. All love to you..!!
@maxkostakis To me, film and music are married and together create the magic that movies have become.
That said, I love every form of art passionately. Writing, dance, film, theater, photography, painting...But music connects them all.
I would argue music is the most powerful art form on earth. What would movies, TV shows, commercials, car rides, etc. be without it?
@fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 It isn't about rich people getting richer, it's about stopping the devaluation of one of our best art forms.
@fearlessdani13 @taylorswift13 Everybody should do it until they agree to pay a fair rate. I'm trying to figure out how to take mine off.
@danilupton @taylorswift13 Because of streaming, most musicians are broke or going broke fast. And the whole industry is suffering.
@danilupton @taylorswift13 It has nothing to do with how much money she has. She is standing up for music in general.
@jasminsalgado_ ((xo))
I love @taylorswift13 for taking her albums off Spotify. Music is art and art is valuable. They are not paying us for our work.
@jessi2006 @ColbieCaillat Thank you!! Her voice is UNREAL on that recording. 💙💚

@Jocanfly I don't have one a lot of the time either, but the collective vibration of joy is still enough to celebrate, even if outside it.

I think we all get online so much to numb our brains of the madness surrounding us. Maybe if we put the machines away we could change it.
If you haven't seen the movie "Boyhood" yet it's beautiful. Shot over 12 years capturing the actors actually grow up in a brilliant way.

@wagtrain That's a very interesting perspective. Love to you still man.
This will not stop me from my mission. My fool's expedition. My little adventure into the vibrance of this life. And I still love you all.
I was forced to join Twitter by a label years ago, and I took it as a challenge to only share beauty. I am surrounded by a flood of black.
The only good I can see coming from this disaster of machines is spreading love and light, but people don't seem to want that, or to care.
@lunaticliclic17 No I'm referring to innumerable current videos.
@Mollee921 I'm not talking about any specific video, I'm talking about almost every video.
@jessi2006 Thank you for caring, as always. ((xo))
@TheHaltertops I'm not sure but humanity seems to be disintegrating and my only hope for us is that we somehow remember what art is again..
@Symesss So are you. ((xo))
Maybe someday we can make music videos again without shots of girls turned around shaking their asses at the camera. It's disgraceful.

My main goal now in life is simply to wake up inspired.
@BeingArtemis Will do. But going off of their live performance last night, it will be insane!
Speaking of #GhostStories I'm going to go get my physical copy now. Can't beat the real tangible thing, blasting windows down on the road.
@Phauker Thank you for keeping my songs company so deep in the dark. ((xo))
@KIMAKUREI I hope to man. Have fun till then. I miss you and that beautiful island!!
@tahanaeee i love you back. ((xo))
Did anyone else watch the @coldplay "Ghost Stories" special last night? They're so insanely magical, beautiful, real..
@KLDSMO All love always!
@erniehalter Me too dude. Crazy.
@AndrewLDixon ;)
@TheHaltertops Yes that too!
Did it go viral? Is it going to go viral? How can we make this go viral? Do we realize what this word "viral" means?? ((All an illusion.))
@lovinvato i love you for listening. ((xo))
@KylaHollywood @ColbieCaillat Thank you for listening to our songs...thank you more than words can say.. ((xo))
@SpaceCowboy_J Very much love to you for those gorgeous humbling words.. ((xo))
@iamDyana Good luck! (Even though you don't need it.)
@iamDyana I'm not saying people shouldn't stare at them, just not all day/night long. ((xo))
@edhogston Definitely the case. I know there are still small rebel militias out there.. ;)
@bev_ll So are you. ((xo))
Instead of staring at screens.. http://t.co/lBkXECxHWD
@ForeverBourne @ColbieCaillat Don't be great for the fame, be great for the love. Fame is a sick game that distracts from the art anyway.
@theMRAnderson Thank you for that. Hope you dig it. ((xo))
The world's supply of dreamers is running dry.
@CheyenneBreese I would feel special if you hadn't sent that to many other people. ((xo))

@KIMAKUREI Hey man! Everything's amazing. I hope the same for you. I gotta come back soon!!

What we need to focus on as a generation of lost souls is love. We should paint every wall, ceiling and floor the color of it's magic.
But graffiti is just like all human expression. Some is ugly, some is art.
I've always seen graffiti as being more beautiful than the stone and steel monstrosities we erect in cities.

@katieliz_w I don't even remember that one sadly. If you have it anywhere would you mind showing me?
@jacs104 @ClaireStevens17 Well I believe you're right. Thanks for encouraging her!
@sunbeamdreamer Thank you very much Maggie! I'm sure you capture it wonderfully.
@leavingslow I'm hoping to combine those two things by having the book of poetry be in my handwriting instead of being typed. ((xo))
@Zacharywarrell Thank you Zach, that means far more than I could explain. Much love!
@palm3rmusic Thank you for thinking so. Truly. ((xo))

@neruaelle It's for people like you I'm writing them. All love!
@EmmaCarelli Thank you for saying so. ((xo))
@JillPedroRoss I love you too. Thank you!
And I'm an artist in a world less concerned with real art. I will sing to the stars. Paint for the birds. Write for the wind. And you.
I want to print books of words I've "written" (channeled through the beauty of the universe) but humanity is abandoning books. I still will.
My social media numbers suffer because I'm not willing to hold a camera in front of my face 24 hours a day. I'm too busy making art. ((xo))

It was hotter than summer on the beach today. Melting the frozen out of my bones.
@HaileySarah3 Thank you! Just words from the universe..
We can fly to Mars in a movie. Or to Saturn in song. Even further within ourselves singing along..
We love art cause we love to be moved. Moving is living. But we can be moved infinite distances without leaving the building.
Lay your armor down. Let your wounds be your weapons. Your scars are your swords and your skin is your shield against them.

@ItsNouhad @_joshnewton This was on a mountaintop in Santa Barbara, California.
@jakecoco Amazing thanks for sharing!
@ItsNouhad The amazing @_joshnewton took that shot actually. But thanks!
We all share the same water. It gets picked up by the sun and rained down all over the world. We don't treat it that way though.
@SaulWilliams You're very welcome. Thank you for sharing your words!
I love @SaulWilliams and his gorgeous tangible writing. If you don't know about his books &amp; records go dig them.
SNOW DAY!!
@MariahMatz Very much love to you for those gorgeous words..and for listening!!
The challenge of an artist is to hold onto innocence and madness and wonder in a world ever trying to rip them all away.

Draw with you eyes closed. Paint wildly with every color..
Draw outside the lines that don't even exist. Forget about the edges of the page and go beyond them..
A new year is a blank page. &amp; a blank page means you can do anything, go anywhere, be anything, create something nobody's ever seen before..
Give love endlessly, if you do it right you won't ever run dry. Peace to the universe. Hope to the dreamers. Cheers!!
Happy New Year to you all!! Let's celebrate the year, but more importantly the moment and all the incredible moments to come in 2014..

We do so many unnecessary things in our lives that stress us out to insane proportions. We need a peaceful escape.

@raquelaberakiki The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan &amp; Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys are two of them. I have too many favorites though!
Listening to music on vinyl brings all the magic and feeling back.
@LexLand just truth! It's a portal to a new emotional landscape..
The mystic @LexLand has one of the most vulnerably tangible vocal deliveries of our time.

Every bend in the road might break your heart until that one unexpected curve. That left turn in a blizzard that opens up to a paradise.
@aditi1dgulati Thank YOU for listening!! All love!
@Ailaaavyou If you think you're on the wrong path, then maybe you should step off and find another. But giving up isn't the way. Much love!!
@Ailaaavyou Thank you for that. Don't allow yourself to imagine giving up. If you believe you're on the right path just keep on.
@karenlimusic Thank you for letting me know! It's old and I've got to take it down.

I love how often Full House is on @nickatnitetv - what a beautiful time machine of a show.
In return, we all become music. And there is no better thing to become because at the heart of all music is love.
Music is vibration. That vibration dances with the vibrations already dancing within us. Not only does it exist inside us, it becomes us.
Music is the only language we all speak. And it's the only language that speaks directly to our hearts. No mind filter or misunderstanding.
I'm gonna officially rename it: "The GREAT Bellevue traffic jam of 2013"

I've said it before, but recording music is a magical thing.
@merssein Maybe I mean we wouldn't feel them so frequently. xO.
@anbrandenburg Thank you for watching!
If we were actually thankful for all the little things we take for granted we wouldn't have time to be angry or down or sad.
Give more than you take. Especially with respect. Especially with love.
There should be a theme ride where you come out bubble wrapped and infuriated!  :)

@iamDyana Hopefully so!
---&gt;&gt; And I'm more than insanely excited for you all to hear the songs. 2014 no doubt. Your patience is beautiful.
I know I've been quiet musically for a moment, but I've been working hard on music with dreams like @ColbieCaillat &amp; @NellyJoyMusic --&gt;&gt;
