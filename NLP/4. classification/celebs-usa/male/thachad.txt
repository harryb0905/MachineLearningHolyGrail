Nice day out at the pump track on the BMX. Keeping it fresh
All in all Tour of Alberta was a great race. Wish I would've made one of the major breaks though!
@mamaof3reeds @boomboomreed nice!
Average speed for today's stage 49.2kph... Not slow
Since we are in Canada I will be racing with what I like to call the mullet wheel set up, shallow in front deep rear. @OSEOUS
Well there wasn't too much wind out there today. Made for a fast stage.
I hope the US doesn't get involved with Syria. #Syria

Nice riding by @craiglewis85 today
fast and furious stage today. Tried going with the first move of the day and it was quickly shut down. It was just survival from there
@ChrisBraden2 @iamtedking @EmersonOronte definitely no KOM, I was just joking, just wanted to go up a bit quicker
Dwell on what you want to happen, not what you don't want to happen. Not only for yourself, but also for others. Keep it positive!
I was definitely feeling the crash from yesterday. But all in all not a bad day. Glad to see my @TeamChampionSys teammates repping up front
Well had a nice little crash today. I don't think I've ever been so close to dropping out. Glad I rode it out. Think I managed a top 10
@snakehawk76 thanks!
Feels good to be racing again! Even though it feels like I'm breathing through a coffee straw. Good times at Utah.
Tour of Utah starts tomorrow equals me eating too much for dinner...
@craiglewis85 haha I don't think any of my files from Utah will be on Strava then. HR is too high at 8000ft

@Champion_System  @TeamChampionSys Thanks, its a pleasure with this team
Well, crashed twice and got sick at Tour de Beauce... Can't complain too much, I have the best job in the world. On to the next one!
@Brock241 I dig em
Also, went down today and tears were shed. But it wasn't because I was in that much pain. It was bc of this: http://t.co/J6g50vsjH1
Well racing sick is no fun. But I'm pretty sure there's quite a few other riders in the same boat as I. One more day!
Headed to Tour de Beauce tomorrow. Looking forward to it
I've been enjoying my time in NJ. Had a nice day trip to NYC and some nice rides in the NJ country side. http://t.co/dEzdRD1kdH
@MilayGalvez @TeamChampionSys @FujiBikes thanks for having us! It was great to meet everyone and really cool to see the 2014 products
Walk into trendy coffee shop.. low volume funky music playing. Me: "is this like the Willy Wonka sound track?" Barista: "umm its Tom Waits"
"@LuisE_Lemus: @thachad good ride! It was good to be in the front with you" thanks man, same here
@craiglewis85 thanks man
@Champion_System Tour de Beauce is next. Looking forward to it!
Well Philly was a great race as always. Just a little bit frustrating getting caught so close to the finish
@Champion_System thanks, wish we could've taking the big W!
Can't help but read @SamuelLJackson tweets in his voice
Looks like fun

Big thanks to @cbutler88 and his family for helping me out at the race
Well... Felt good the first half, then asthma/allergies got the best of me
Got a whole lot of nothing to do before the race. Hotel room stuntin
On my way to Chattanooga! @TeamChampionSys will have an army of two for USnats, me and @cbutler88

@bobbietraksel American style!
I love riding my bike. Plain and simple
I'll be starting my mornings with this http://t.co/ekASOJVus9
Going without coffee for the week. Had way too much at #ToC
Really enjoyed #ToC this year. Had a great time with @TeamChampionSys
Good morning San Francisco http://t.co/SJ4sbkBrkH
Good morning sunshine!
@TeamChampionSys is all ready to go out to dinner, just waiting on @Mattbrammeier85 to fix his hair
Thanks to all my @TeamChampionSys teammates. Solid riding by all today
Well I went all in pretty early on Diablo, maybe too early. But I gave it a go! Great ride to @cbutler88 !
Enjoyed the tt even though I didn't post a great time. Cool to hear the fans cheering!
I've never raced a tt like this one before
Still had fun! I enjoy being on the mix
Well I didn't really want to go in the break again today. I left a bit too much out there yesterday. Legs were very tired today
@DavidR_Williams welllll actually
"@MilayGalvez: HUGE CONGRATS @thachad for winning the most courageous rider @atoc @TeamChampionSys @fujibikes" Thanks!
HARD day in the office! All day in the break with Great company, everyone worked well! All super nice guys
Well that was a solid first stage of #ToC
Never a huge KORN fan but refound the song Blind. Pre race music.
@BigJonny thanks man. Hopefully I can get the Tecate levels in a celebratory style after a solid race here
@Topher_Chase congrats
3rd doping control test in two weeks. I think the whole #ToC peloton has been tested two times over here.
Had a very nice spin down to the coast today with the @TeamChampionSys boys today. Great day and great company
@taylorphinney @MarkCavendish @AdamBlythe89 there's a whole bunch of awesome in that pic
Cool to see so many familiar face here #ToC, gonna be a fun race!
And the sun is shining in California
Heading to California today. I love short afternoon travel. Had a nice cappuccino @StellaJava and a nice ride before my travel
@SteveMartinToGo I shouldn't have bet on B horse
@RyanRoth52 looks like fun.. Aye!
Sad I'm not at Gila, but I'm definitely looking forward to ToC!
Today I felt "fresher" than a Will Smith t-shirt http://t.co/Q7BRgRw5Xa
I should've kept my FSLR stock...
@BigJonny I think you need to get her to write some blogs at DC
Back on American soil after a solid month of racing, really enjoyed it. Now just one more connection and I'm back in Tucson
@brentbookwalter good ol stink eye!
"@cbutler88: Good last day in Trentino. Big thanks to @thachad for the big help all day." No prob! Cool to see you ride well
One more day of #trentino, let's make it count
Really enjoying Trentino! great race and @cbutler88 had a great ride today
@Kristoff87 who's that goofy looking guy? http://t.co/RrBluTVIDe
I think this pairs well with just about any meal in Belgium http://t.co/eUZcGhXwv4
Nice little recovery day in Belgium http://t.co/Wag946GG0Y
Hanging out in Belgium before my next race Trentino. Looking forward to racing in Italy
JIM TV and TMF, good ol Belgium
Back in Belgium! And no snow on the ground this time around. About 1/3rd of my flight from Pisa were riders for tomorrows race
The novelty of riding in the rain quickly fades for this sun loving guy
Now a easy ride and some sight seeing with the Fiancee today.
Had a great ride in the mountains yesterday! Enjoying Lucca to the max. http://t.co/1oCKMtyByp
How do they make it so good? http://t.co/VXfxk3m25q
Analogy of the day: Lucca, Italy is to a Pro Cyclist as Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory is to a fat 8yr old.
If feels great to be in Lucca
@craiglewis85 ooooohhhhhh I will.
Meant to say " freezing temperatures/snow thing" in the other tweet. I think I'm still warming up and not thinking straight
Still got in a solid 190km! on to the next one!
Was hoping to go way better at Volta Limburg... I don't think my body likes this whole riding in freezing temperatures/snow think!
Limburg on Saturday. Looking forward to it! Rain, wind, or snow! But I'd prefer Sun and lots of it.
Belgium.. where the racing is hard and the weather is cold. Glad to get in some good days of solid racing here at De Panne

@thejpmurph on my way over there now. What's your schedule looking like?
Great job Zach Bell! First win for @TeamChampionSys in 2013 !
@iamtedking everything in moderation
Now it's time for me to go put the icing on the cake, one last 5+hr day to cap off this week. All this suffering better pay off @HerriottSP
Pretty cool to see @taylorphinney and @Kristoff87 up in the top 10 at #msr ! Good job
Ciolek played that perfectly
@BigJonny I think the weather more than makes up for the 47km. If there's an asterisk it should be to stipulate that the winner is a baller
On another note its officially very warm in Tucson, like 34degrees Celsius warm. Getting my tan lines back
I'm not a fan of double days. I'd prefer to ride 8hrs straight than two different 2hr rides in the same day. Double days are lame.
I don't know if I can be in this coffee shop. I don't have a beard, tats, or flannel... #unwrittendresscode
And sometimes I just have to listen to the music incredibly loud. #sorryneighbors
@Brock241 my next race is in Holland
And now the epic travel home beings!
Tour de Langkawi finished, 10 good days of racing in the legs. Great race to start 2013 off with. Enjoying being part of @TeamChampionSys !
Unfortunately I had a bad day when I needed to have a great one. Now its time to go for some stages
I have a feeling the bad weather in belgium could suit one of the riders on @TeamChampionSys pretty well. Good luck guys!
One hard climbing day done. One harder one to come!
