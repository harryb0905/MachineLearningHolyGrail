A man is never so proud as when striking an attitude of humility.😎
Life lives amidst tension &amp; busyness needs leisure. Leisure that recreates &amp; renews. A time to think new thoughts, not ponder old ills. 😎
The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure. 😎

You don't have to be a "person of influence" to be influential. 😎
It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves. 😎
Change your thoughts and you can change the world.😎
Adversity is like a strong wind, it tears away from us all but the things that can't be torn, that after we see ourselves as we really are.

Simplicity is making the journey of this life with just baggage enough.😎
History is what happened in our lives; baggage is how we feel about it.😎
"Time management" is really a misnomer- the challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.😎
You can't do anything about the length of your life...but you can do something about its width and depth.😎
Do the best you can, where you are, with what you have, now.😎
The tragedy of life for many people is not that they don't have enough strengths; it's that they are unaware of the ones they have.😎
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.😎
The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one.😎
Those that fail to command their thoughts will soon lose command of their actions.😎
Words are a key to the other person's heart, and listening with the intention to understand enhances conversation.😎
The heart of the discerning  acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out.😎

The most thoroughly wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed.😎
A glad heart makes a happy face.😎
When life knocks you down, try to land on your back, because if you can look up, you can get up!😎
Time is the coin of your life, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you. 😎
The reason most major goals are not achieved is that we spend our time doing second things first.😎
From small beginnings come great things...😎
If you limit your choices only to what seems possible, you disconnect urself from what you truly want, and all you have left is compromise.😎
Slow down and enjoy life. It's not the scenery you miss by going to fast-you also miss the sense of where you are going and why.😎
Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own.😎
Often, it's not about becoming a new person, but becoming the person you were meant to be, and already are, but don't know how to be.😎
It's never too late to have a happy childhood...😎

The way you spend your hours and your days is the way you spend your life.😎
If it's free, it's advice; if you pay for it, it's counseling; if you can use either one, it's a miracle.😎
The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.😎
When we are no longer able to change a situation...we are challenged to change ourselves.😎
Regard your good name as the richest jewel you can possibly be possessed of.😎
Constant kindness can accomplish much. As the sun makes ice melt, kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate.😎
You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions.😎
Dreams are the touchstone of our characters...our truest life is when we are in dreams awake.😎
When we get too caught up in the busyness of the world we lose connection with one another- and ourselves. 😎
True contentment comes with empathy.😎
Unselfish and noble actions are the most radiant pages in the biography of souls.😎

The best way to improve self-control is to see how and why you lose control.😎
Being a giver doesn't require extraordinary acts of sacrifice. It just involves a focus on acting in the interest of others.😎
Acknowledging the good that we already have in our lives is the foundation for all abundance.😎
Try and go a day without complaining...  A week if you think you don't complain.😎
Stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others.😎
Just because the past didn't turn out like you wanted it to, doesn't mean your future can't be better than you ever imagined.😎
Listen without defending; speak without offending.😎

Don't sit back and let things happen to you. Go out and happen to things.😎
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.😎
Many have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It isn't through self-gratification, but the fidelity to a worthy purpose.😎
A self is not something static, tied up in a pretty parcel and handed to a child, finished and complete. A self is always becoming.😎
If we are so busy being successful that we don't have time to be happy, then we need to seriously reconsider our definition of success.😎
The ultimate measure of our lives is not  how much time we spend on the planet, but how much energy we invest in the time that we have.😎
Give light, and the darkness will disappear of itself.😎

As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them.😎
Anyone who has a WHY to live can bear almost any WHAT.😎
The key to growth is to learn to make promises and to keep them.😎
What is your biggest challenge?
Improvement isn't inevitable. Change is.😎
The measure of a man is not where he stands in moment of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.
If you could magically go back in time and change something you did or didn't do today, what would it be?
SMALL changes can make a BIG difference.😎

We don't stop dreaming and exploring because we grow old. We grow old because we stop dreaming and exploring.
Live in such a way that if someone spoke badly of you, no one would believe it.
Selfishness is weakness. But loving and caring for others is a position of power beyond anything we can possibly imagine.
Happiness will come to you when it comes from you. Success will be yours when you choose to take responsibility for making it so.
When someone else's happiness is your happiness, that's love.
