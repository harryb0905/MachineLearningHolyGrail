How is that not OB?
Oops https://t.co/GrdsHKuvTq
The LA Chargers are currently getting knocked back to San Diego! This is been a physical mismatch total domination by New England.
Pats oline is dispensing justice!  This is an ass whipping
The Pats are forced to punt... Father Time catching up with Brady? Hahaha
Of course ever rule bent toward the O having success. https://t.co/uaK5OlVofL

Welp! https://t.co/07urxwbrFw
Gronk is a complete player. In a day and age where the TE thinks he‚Äôs a WR Gronk is a throwback at the point of attack
Crazy to see Hunter Henry out there playing. Amazing
Wham pass using 87 as lead blocker and getting 11 on the over beautiful design and execution

You don‚Äôt get anymore Patriots than taking what the D is giving! 7-0. You won‚Äôt beat Tom Brady by playing what you always play going to have to change it up.
They were smoking off the ball! Great Job creating a new LOS https://t.co/OqFqn7b4aF
First drive by Brady seven completions six of them to running backs.
Chargers play cover 3 about 90% of the time. Last time these two teams met the Pats won 21-13 &amp; the running backs caught 14 passes for 160+ yards in the flat.
CJ always looks like that even he‚Äôs super fit. Just the way his body is... no shame in his game he was thunder punching fools! https://t.co/QYPvK06fGb

Nothing more to moralizing for a defense to just get it run down your freaking throat. Rams are flexing their muscles üí™üèΩ
Lots of ghost motion to be true but it‚Äôs all run out of 11 personnel. Rams are in 11....97% of the game https://t.co/Ym9EFyctX4
Same exact thing we ran in the 90s actually had a long conversation with McVay about it https://t.co/fNM1I9spbV
For all the talk about the innovative offense that you have to have with the young coach. The rams are running 18/19 handoff. Simple wide zone cut back Run.
Great release by TY
Terrible holding call.
Mahomes is like an elite shortstop throwing from different angles accurately
5th offsides penalty. STUPID
KC is 3/3 on fourth down dive plays
Perfect KC gets the ball to start the 2nd half.
This game just got less interesting
Closer than it looked! https://t.co/DWDAlDvW9V
Terrible even! https://t.co/qH61h2gxgx
Game just got interesting
Colts are playing like they put money on the Chiefs!
Ebron 1 drop on 3rd down and one route run short of the sticks on 3rd down.
3rd encroachment call. Indy can‚Äôt overcome KC and the Penalties
What a great block by Fisher
Nice box out by Mahomes
Colts D quit jumping offsides and make a play or this game is gonna get late early.
Good news is the Colts have been fine upfront in protection and in the running game. Good sign
Colts need to come away with at least 3 on this drive

Stop inside the five should equal points for Chicago.
The juxtaposition of the Chargers and Bears defense. Chargers never played a LB swapping them for DB‚Äôs and the Bears kept all four LB‚Äôs on the field for that entire first to drive
Mack not worried about Foles on the zone read.
Looks like a touchdown to Crabtree but I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt overturn it because Instant replace sucks

Chargers drawing straws to line up over Hurst. He‚Äôs struggling
Jackson must put a scoring drive together here or I believe it‚Äôs time to turn to Flacco.

Pooch kickoff another bad coaching call. Even with a 3 &amp; out you allowed the Raiders to flip the field and pin you deep.

After that run I can see why the #Broncos keep getting caught with 12 men on the field....
2/20 &amp; 3/20 throw the ball at the LOS! The lullaby offense.

3/13 and Baker has 5 seconds to throw. Come on guys.
Bad Throw but nice result on the PI.
Broncos completely out hit in the first two drives have responded nicely in this drive
Broncos should just punt on this 1st down.
Baker is all Balls!
That‚Äôs the way to start fast as an offense. Can the coaches for the Broncos quit talking about starting fast.

1) The team is not playing well of course the loss His fault. 2) he said his mindset was on the sack record and he was selfish. His words not mine! https://t.co/UTVnFVPRwG
Big difference between jumping to snap count and jumping offsides. One is a penalty and one isn‚Äôt. https://t.co/F1QaYXmQWx
I love Von. I‚Äôve posted several of his Vons vision events. He is a Hall of Fame player far better than I ever was. Putting my opinion that was a playoff game and your mindset shouldn‚Äôt be on setting the sack record. It should be on winning keeping your playoff hopes alive https://t.co/SqiJvpKSCa
I didn‚Äôt blame him for the loss. I just endorsed what he said about his game, he was selfish. His mindset, going into the game was to try to set all time Broncos Sack record. His words not mine. https://t.co/EGbPu2JUb6
You did because your my nuggets producer! Haha https://t.co/AoPwcy9nNs
Well I had @NFLonFOX do the research and you‚Äôre incorrect he hasn‚Äôt won more games playing that way than he‚Äôs lost. As a matter of fact when he has 3 accepted penalties against him the Broncos are .500. https://t.co/cAnXP0JHhg
Really? He accounted of more positive offensive yardage for the 49ers offense than negative yardage than the Broncos defense. That‚Äôs fact. How many games have they won when Von has had 3+ penalties vs how many of those games have they lost? I have no clue just curious https://t.co/cAnXP0JHhg

Probably a bit more but not all that much different. I think there are two main factors. 1) less practice time means less skill development on knownow how to hold and how to do it w/o being caught. 2) game is more spread and open then it was so it easier to see for refs! https://t.co/zABCkMiZPe

Keenum converting on several third downs on the TD Drive was big-time
Good run by Freeman avoiding the penetration over LG and finding a lane for the TD.
Right. https://t.co/JqvyQL5OnN
Praise Keenum then he overs throws two TD‚Äôs. Game of inches
Keenum changes his arm angle on the third and short throw for a first down. It‚Äôs the little things that matter
Who Ray the Broncos finally get a first down!
The fact that these two teams have looked evenly matched thru 2 practices and early in the game saddens me https://t.co/VadjY8XE4O

Valuable lesson for Chad Kelly... don‚Äôt be late
Still my all time favorite video we‚Äôve ever done. https://t.co/6KVP7S9gqI
Chad Kelly buys time, gets a mouthful Riddell and still completes the pass for a touchdown.
6 QB‚Äôs played tonight in the @Broncos &amp; @Vikings game, a 1st rounder, a 4th rounder, two 7th rounders, &amp; two free agents. The 1st rounder is far and away the worst of the lot.
Chad Kelly redirecting protection bring in is tight end into the backfield scrambling around his kid is playing well
Chad Kelly leapfrogs Paxton on the depth chart with 1 Drive.
J jewel plays with leverage takes on the tackle sheds the bigger man and makes the stop excellent technique
Great blitz pick up by number 70 of the Broncos. Honors the double a gap kicks out to the edge defender.
Broncos had 1 first down in the 1st half
Is that good? https://t.co/OeXXOwRHss
The outlaw Josey jewel reads the pull of the guard and slices behind it in the A gap to make the tackle for a loss
Good for you Isaiah McKenzie!
Zone read for the TD by Freeman love how he set up the second level safety within inside move and then cut to the outside and beat the defense to the pylon
Total lack of awareness by Broncos Oline 77 has to snap off the Tackle/End game. That‚Äôs football 101.
Illegal contact is going to be a point of emphasis this year points were down last season they want to keep drives alive in the NFL
Back shoulder fade so difficult for the DB to defend and a great throw by Trevor S
Throw that slant into traffic gotta keep the ball down...that said catch the ball broncos.
Horrible, ridiculous, asinine, call on Justin Simmons unnecessary roughness.
Doesn‚Äôt bother me nearly as muck as the 2 long runs! https://t.co/9nxY7Kw89V
Bradley Chubb redeems himself knifing under the TE on the goal line play
