@CptBozoJabroni The parents are choosing to abandon their kids.
@manolo_jiujitsu https://t.co/Kvehdk1rTy
@dazzaDS Yes look a history.
@CptBozoJabroni No because I would do any thing to stay with them. Not abandon them. Don’t let the media brainwash you.
@manolo_jiujitsu No I’m giving MexiCan/America’s the dream that hard work pays off. By obeying the laws. I had to do it. I change my life by obeying laws. That why where I am in my life. Obey the laws of our great country.
@manolo_jiujitsu Im a 4th generation MexiCan/America that wants safety for my kids. Do you want America like Mexico? Or worse Europe or Germany? You need to do your research!
@manolo_jiujitsu They are not ripped. The parents choose to abandon them. Obama did it more an all presidents put together.
@manolo_jiujitsu We live by laws. Why do people want to live In the USA?

@JWSteel1 Well I’ve worked for Trump and I’m 5 different ethnicities so I’m not racist nor could be called one.
@Russ01417768 @horsesandbeer @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!!???
But the media is able to do the exact same thing the other way and many Americans are made to believe it. @realDonaldTrump told everyone what he was going to do. We voted!&amp; won! Now media talks bad about a president like no other that keeps his word. 🤔 #8moreyears 🙏🏼
