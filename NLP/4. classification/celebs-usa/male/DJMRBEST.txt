@united I love ya, but feedback is always needed for progress. Thank you!
@UnitedAirHelp its about navigating around these unfortunate delays that are temporary not permanent vs REAL world problems. Have a good day
@UnitedAirHelp If you fly enough delays as this will happen with any carrier, I love @united, they treat me well, but feedback is needed.
@united Same answer as always huh? No worries, I re-booked myself as I would be still waiting if i depended on ur Twitter acct to help.
@united they just took us all off the plane. These are issue you need to deal with before boarding, obviously. It's a operational mistake.
Hey @united, note to self: Work on maintenance issues when plane is sitting &amp; waiting at gate for an hr, not when we board. 👎🏻👎🏻 #TravelWars

This is how I feel after djing some nights haha “@HuffingtonPost: The most epic news anchor sign-off ever http://t.co/r0i94cH6pO”
@nfl refs have been pretty terrible this yr. they continue to make horrible inconsistent calls. They determine the outcomes of these games.
I'm appalled by this case. Just threw up in my mouth.. We can't ever be "equal" if we continue to separate ourselves as humans. #BeBetter
Same judge sent black kid who killed another kid with one punch to jail for 10 YRS!! That was last yr. unreal. Straight rich/poor sh*t..
He's getting sent to a 400k/yr rehab spot in Cali while kids from the hood get sent to jail to rot. Shit is 1 reason why we are separated.
Teenage rich kid gets off after killing 4 ppl drunk driving. Country club shit to the fullest. I would be hung to die in jail if it was me.

@djhomicide the Gasol trade was amazing and was reason that championship was won, that and Kobe beasting.
@djhomicide not talking about those organic championships, it's when they brought in Payton and that team &amp; last yr. everyone loves the sun
I don't feel bad for Lakers fans at all, ur team try's to buy a championship by putting together an apparent "dream team" and it backfired 😭
