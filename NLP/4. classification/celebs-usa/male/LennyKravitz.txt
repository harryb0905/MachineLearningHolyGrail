He was the sweetest most sensitive man you could ever meet and had a passion for music and art that burned until his final breath. We were family and I was blessed to have him in my life.
He had an extensive list of people that he worked with, live and in the studio, from The Rolling Stones to The Isley Brothers. In the studio he recorded my Black and White America and Strut albums.
My brother in spirit Tom "Bone" Edmonds has passed on to the next. He was my first live engineer. He mixed my debut concert at The Green Parrot club in New Jersey and we went on to work together for many years, headlining arenas and stadiums worldwide. https://t.co/4eSVRUWtde
