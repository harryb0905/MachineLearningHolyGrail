I don't think Mr. Cohen is coming to our @HouseIntel Committee empty-handed. Take a look at the kinds of questions I'll want answers to during this week's hearing: https://t.co/GRwdUXkjbO
"Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the President to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border." #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/1IwT6GpvBV
The Trump Admin’s #gagrule is an egregious affront to human rights, affecting over 4 million Americans' access to #healthcare, &amp; primarily targeting the most vulnerable among us. RT to raise awareness of this despicable policy &amp; say #DontGagMyCare. https://t.co/dk00bzyDEC
Whether you need help with a federal agency, are trying to find out if federal grants are available for your project, or are considering applying to a service academy, my #IL05 staff can help! Take advantage of the next two visiting office hours: https://t.co/Rs7PI7Nhsx
These major conflicts of interest raise serious concerns about the ethics system our government relies on. When will this Administration prioritize our environment + public health over corporate greed + pollution profits? https://t.co/mTIxBqnF9Z
Tonight, in honor of #BlackHistoryMonth, my #IL05 staff attended @EqualityILL &amp; @CongressmanRaja’s roundtable discussion on the #EqualityAct. It’s time to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to also prohibit #LGBTQ discrimination! https://t.co/bkvlUtwAMe
The #FakeTrumpEmergency is a gross abuse of power, and I'm pleased to see #Illinois join several other states in standing up against this manufactured crisis. https://t.co/EsZk0oq0IM
A chilling report on the lack of peace of mind surrounding the defense of our democratic process. We must be assertive + diligent about filling our #electionsecurity needs. https://t.co/3xGNLQZYta
I believe all Americans deserve access to taxpayer-funded #CRSreports because their wide dissemination helps support an informed constituency that is essential to a well-functioning democracy. Read my letter: https://t.co/fV5mtyrbuj

If President Trump thinks Congress will allow him to waste our constituents’ hard-earned tax dollars on a wall we don’t need or usurp the authority the Founding Fathers gave to us through the power of the purse, he is mistaken. #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/rQiajo3Xla
#Illinois added +1,300 #solar jobs in 2018, giving it the 13th-largest solar workforce in the U.S.! Pleased to see our state doing what's needed to prioritize clean #energy &amp; create well-paying jobs in the process. https://t.co/Q3WLTXxmnx
He shouldn't, given his Admin's claim that tweets = official statements.  My #COVFEFEAct amends the Presidential Records Act to include the term “social media” as a documentary material, ensuring additional preservation of POTUS communication to promote government accountability. https://t.co/jBN8zbk5ZO
One year ago, we witnessed the deadliest high school shooting in US history. I urge my colleagues to follow the example of #Parkland students who refuse to accept these tragic events as business as usual.

The American people deserve free access to federal court records, and courts deserve a modernized way of maintaining those documents.

As founder &amp; chair of the #Transparency Caucus, I've made it my mission to provide the public with increased access to the inner workings of their government, including the justice system. That's why I introduced the Electronic Court Records Reform Act: https://t.co/ExeVKqML7o

#GlobalGagRule is horribly detrimental to the wellbeing of over 4 million Americans who receive #healthcare through #TitleX. In order to promote access to quality care, we should work to improve provider-patient relationships—not undermine them. #NoGagRule https://t.co/oDClXzxfQ1
The closure of a section of #LakeShoreDrive due to extremely hazardous conditions is an alarming wake up call, but it’s not the first. As Vice Chair of the #Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I'll work to make sure our #infrastructure needs are met. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/qO4RBbvAgi
Sadly, America’s infrastructure has earned its D+ rating from @ASCETweets. Our #transportation system has made us the most prosperous &amp; powerful nation in the world, but decades of underfunding crucial maintenance have crippled the infrastructure we rely on for continued growth. https://t.co/uTomBStkcc
You work hard to give your kids a better chance than you had. My dad, Bill, was the epitome of this philosophy. His version of the American Dream inspired me, and I am forever grateful for his example.  Thank you all for the outpouring of love &amp; support. https://t.co/1JfTrdHfDC
Today, my dad passed away after a long battle with Parkinson’s. He was a loving father, a compassionate confidant, and the most hardworking man I knew. He instilled in me the importance of commitment and his integrity inspired me more than he probably ever knew.
President Trump and his inner circle have a serious problem with the truth, but House Democrats are seeking it at every turn. As founder of the #Transparency Caucus, I believe the American people have a right to see their president's #taxreturns. https://t.co/2LcKs2z2Di

45 years ago, Nixon used #SOTU address to talk about the nation's prosperity &amp; to ward off Congress regarding that pesky Watergate investigation—Obviously, Congressional Democrats weren't intimidated by the President's words then &amp; we're certainly not going to be intimidated now. https://t.co/Kq5rlITC80

The #GreatLakes are a major economic fixture &amp; essential environmental ecosystem, which requires our support—My "Great Lakes Fishery Research Authorization Act" or GLFRA will help @USGS conduct key scientific assessments &amp; research in support of fisheries. https://t.co/BIBfvVnBog
The #GreatLakes are an American treasure, supporting a $7 billion economy, 1.5M jobs &amp; drinking water for 40 million people. That's why I'm proud to reintroduce the "Great Lakes Fishery Research Authorization Act" to preserve &amp; protect this vital resource. https://t.co/BIBfvVnBog

Greatness or gridlock? How about empty rhetoric or actual action? Time for @realDonaldTrump to stop saying he is for positive results and instead actually put in the work to achieve them. #SOTU⁠ ⁠
Proud to wear #suffragette white with my #SOTU guest Chante &amp; @SpeakerPelosi in honor of equality + opportunity for all. https://t.co/HVvOJlz2R7
Chante, thank you for joining me at tonight's #SOTU address. Your commitment to helping your community is inspiring. https://t.co/BA3IIUXsyj
My #SOTU guest, Chante, told me: “Taxpayers count on their refund check year after year to pay bills, pay for college &amp; make big purchases they couldn't ordinarily afford. We still are unsure when taxpayers can expect to receive refunds.”   We must prevent another #TrumpShutdown.
Fewer #IRS employees impacts taxpayers &amp; tax professionals preparing for the 2019 filing season, resulting in delayed returns, difficulty obtaining loans, paused audits/exams, &amp; unanswered questions for families. That's why I intro'd leg to reopen the IRS during #TrumpShutdown.
From the payment of house bills &amp; her daughter's college tuition to filling their car with gas, the #TrumpShutdown created financial anxiety for my #SOTU guest, Chante, and 800,000 federal workers across the country. Read more about Chante's experience: https://t.co/p1n2tS7rgX https://t.co/NegtlBdwCU

#TrumpShutdown not only put Chante out of work + unable to help taxpayers, but it also caused severe fear &amp; uncertainty surrounding her family’s own financial responsibilities. I look forward to meeting w/ Chante to thank her for her service &amp; hear more about her experience #SOTU https://t.co/7c9tfT41nD
It is my pleasure to invite furloughed IRS employee, Chante Copeland-Smith, to join me as my guest for #SOTU. Chante has dedicated her career to helping American taxpayers navigate the refund process &amp; receive the money they rely on to make ends meet. https://t.co/OE7ZzHzl3n

A senior campaign official was “directed” to contact Roger Stone about additional Wikileaks releases in July 2016.

What the #transban is really about is #transerasure—removing transgender people from federal recognition and public life and treating their health as cosmetic, not medical. This stay by SCOTUS is shameful, but we will keep fighting. We must pass the #EqualityAct now!
Despicable decision to institute a #transban has nothing to do with the military. How do we know? Because time &amp; again, top military officials have told Congress that unit cohesion has NOT been affected by full inclusion of #transgender troops. In fact, it has improved readiness. https://t.co/bLhAUg4nL5

My #IL05 staff attended the 17th Police District Senior Meeting yesterday. I thank the #Chicago Commission on Human Relations (CCHR) for the support &amp; resources they are providing #seniors in the case of discrimination or hate crimes. https://t.co/hR5gUAI4A1
Excited to kick off #QuigleyQs to answer your ?s about my work in DC. @theGSpledge asks: “What is your plan to make college, if not free, at least affordable?"

Yesterday, the VP declared that ISIS had been defeated. That same day, 4 Americans were killed in a horrific ISIS attack in Northern Syria.

As Chairman-designate of the #Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees GSA, I intend to call the GSA Administrator before my subcommittee and demand an explanation for the agency's irresponsible behavior on the #TrumpHotel. Read my statement: https://t.co/33Ih2oCEUz
By acknowledging Emoluments concerns &amp; ignoring need to conduct a constitutional analysis, agency leaders have thrown into question their ability to fulfill GSA’s mission and show they are working on behalf of the American people—not the Trump Organization https://t.co/iLzGnAfrBn
Any reasonable person would conclude that the Trump Hotel’s acceptance of payments from foreign governments raises the strong possibility of a clear conflict of interest, but the GSA refused speak up and do its job. #TrumpHotel
The GSA’s disingenuous decision-making process &amp; explicit disregard for the Constitution, as well as its own legal responsibilities, is beyond troubling for all Americans who care about government #transparency. https://t.co/sdTAANzrmy
The GSA is is expected to hold the President accountable should he attempt to exploit his office for personal gain. Unfortunately, GSA ignored that responsibility, turning a blind eye as Trump continues to personally profit from his hotel in violation of the lease agreement. https://t.co/CGulATHiCi
From safeguarding our election infrastructure against foreign attacks to ensuring adequate funding for IRS, I'll fight to ensure that key agencies have the resources + tools they need to effectively and efficiently serve the American people. Read more: https://t.co/fBpgCTMwWJ

From the shuttering of domestic violence hotlines &amp; the delay of disaster relief funds to the burdens placed on air traffic control and TSA agents, who I met with at @fly2ohare today, the list of #TrumpShutdown consequences is far more extensive &amp; grave than we can imagine. https://t.co/K4nG6L6vxi

A grave, disheartening reminder that homophobia &amp; transphobia still run rampant, incl. in our schools. Students should feel safe &amp; supported, not demonized &amp; ostracized. It's on all of us to continue stepping up as #LGBTQ allies &amp; examples of acceptance. https://t.co/DuFPuKHX9h
Did you know: #TrumpShutdown unconscionably forces air traffic controllers, along with #TSA agents &amp; other crucial safety officials, to work long hours without pay?

19 days of uncertainty &amp; counting, this bill reopens a number of vital agencies that the American people rely upon every single day. Proud of my Democratic colleagues, and the 8 Republican Members who joined us, for voting to #EndTheShutdown. https://t.co/qRlbQ6UeE1
We can &amp; must put a stop to this chaos that is rattling our communities and disrupting our economy. By passing my Financial Services #Appropriations bill, we will be able to get more than 130,000 workers back to work and receiving a paycheck! #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/pU3EtUTi7Q
My bill—which is virtually identical to the Senate-passed legislation—rejects cuts to @SBAgov, blocks Trump from doling out lavish raises to the VP, &amp; includes back pay for federal employees furloughed during #TrumpShutdown. Learn more via @AppropsDems: https://t.co/0qlJ6lbOie
Consumer Protection Watchdog Shuttered: Most services provided by the FTC are suspended under #TrumpShutdown, including the National Do Not Call Registry, consumer complaint systems &amp; identity theft reporting—as well as law enforcement access to FTC’s consumer complaints.
Securities Industry Regulator Closed: Nearly all SEC employees are furloughed, limiting the agency’s activities to process and approve filings. A prolonged #TrumpShutdown will require companies to delay mergers, IPOs, and other actions, hindering economic activity.
Support for Small Businesses Stopped: During the #TrumpShutdown, @SBAgov has completely halted its role in the federal contracting process, interfering with projects government wide, and has stopped approving loan assistance.
IRS Customer Service Halted: All taxpayer customer service, including walk-in taxpayer assistance centers, which together serve approximately 2.5 million citizens monthly, is unavailable during the #TrumpShutdown.
Because of the #TrumpShutdown, some of the most important activities funded in the Financial Services and General Government bill have ground to a halt. In addition to tax return processing, the shutdown has also led to other serious impacts...
THREAD—As the Chairman-designate of the Financial Services Subcommittee on @AppropsDems, I’ve seen how the #TrumpShutdown is creating chaos in our communities &amp; economy.   That’s why I introduced legislation to reopen key agencies &amp; alleviate the impacts on families &amp; businesses.

With +800k federal employees left stranded w/o pay, it's shameful that the WH would even consider using the #TrumpShutdown as its own personal payday. An ego-driven failure to lead is not an opportunity to dole out raises for the VP &amp; POTUS' inner circle. https://t.co/4TzWR5HPtg
As Chairman-designate of the Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing the Exec. Office of the President, I strongly urge the WH to back off its despicable attempt to line its own pockets as the American people suffer from—and are distracted by—a shutdown of Trump's own making. https://t.co/RHVsRN9Ye5

As we commemorate our bicentennial and all that Illinoisans have achieved over the last 200 years, I look forward to the next 200 years in anticipation of our state’s continued strength and success, which not only benefits our communities but our country as a whole.
Did you know this week marks the 200th anniversary of our great state?  It is a privilege to represent #Illinois and the City of #Chicago in Congress, and I'm convinced that there is no greater place to start a family, build a business, or simply visit just for fun.
ICYMI: 16 of the last 17 years were the warmest on record across the globe. We’re running out of time to protect our health &amp; invest in our world’s future. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/saaMmYtQc1

In the meantime, Republicans should accelerate the release of transcripts. If they use the next month to continue their efforts of obstruction, have no doubt that come January, Dems will release these transcripts &amp; call back key witnesses to get our investigation back on track.
Cohen’s plea highlights what we’ve known on the House Intelligence Committee for quite some time: several of our witnesses were untruthful in their testimonies. Cohen must come back in front of HPSCI, as does Roger Stone. https://t.co/R74lRfVS7c
.@EPA has turned to the @DailyCaller to downplay &amp; disprove the government’s own findings on #climatechange.   Denial, ignorance, or both—using a conspiracy theorist website for your "fact-checking" is as transparent as it is unacceptable. https://t.co/2x8mf61esS
Via @politico: Rep. Quigley, another HPSCI member, said this week's developments underscore what he considers a truism after nearly two years investigating the Trump campaign: "There are no coincidences... There’s about 18 Trump associates communicating with the Russians." https://t.co/qDA0BpBb1F

I stand with #Ukraine and the international community as they once again face down Russian military aggression, and I call on Russia to immediately release the ships and sailors illegally seized.
Taking a page out of the Kremlin Playbook, naturally Putin would try to claim this attack was staged. When everything is "fake news" nothing is real. We’ve seen it ourselves in the US for the past 2 years as we know Trump loves to emulate Putin’s tactics. https://t.co/Q8zsTavN2t

It is no coincidence that Trump’s pick for Acting AG has denounced the investigation &amp; accused Mueller of "going too far," calling his impartiality into serious question—B/c of these comments advocating for a limited probe, #Whitaker should also recuse himself from its oversight. https://t.co/28Z4vDDuS2

In April, I asked #GSA Administrator Murphy about the plan to scrap #FBI HQ relocation &amp; whether or not she had communication with President Trump or other WH officials about this decision. She said no.  Today, we revealed new evidence that says otherwise. https://t.co/HPBcZbinOo

The #GreatLakes Coastal Resiliency Study will help gauge the health of our coastline &amp; better protect the region from lake erosion, runoff, #flooding, lake level fluctuations, &amp; aging #infrastructure.  That's why I asked @USACEHQ to fund this key study: https://t.co/MJWpmgRyIf https://t.co/2HhJujX8Re
Since the beginning of 2018, my #IL05 district offices have received numerous complaints about #mail delivery that I find extremely concerning &amp; wildly unacceptable.

21 days to go until the #midterms &amp; we still haven't safeguarded our #election systems from foreign interference. We can't afford to wait until the 11th hour to implement a plan—especially since that is when many bad actors are likely to strike. https://t.co/90pXwSNqWZ

In response to these concerns, I also used my position as the top Democrat on the Subcommittee overseeing #USPS to secure language in the FY19 funding bill that requires staffing level reports from @USPS &amp; a plan to deliver better service in the future.

.@antiviolence Project found an 86% increase from 2016 to 2017 in anti-#LGBTQ homicides.   Hateful rhetoric &amp; discriminatory policies will only make things worse. We must continue to speak out—in word &amp; action—against all forms of intolerance &amp; violence. https://t.co/xVc3RMfpsl

@ScottDavis44th $380 million for FY18.
I secured $380 million for new #electionsecurity grants in FY18. Every single state requested $$ from these grants in order to upgrade their systems &amp; better train their staff.

It was irresponsible &amp; reckless for Republicans to leave Washington before the #midterms without addressing #electionsecurity.

Temperament &amp; Independence.  In addition to the credible allegations of sexual assault made against him, these are two essential traits that Judge Kavanaugh just does not possess.
The #Kavanaugh FBI investigation did not include interviews with key sources &amp; was prevented from accessing key documents &amp; even excluded a key allegation. In no way is this report thorough or complete. https://t.co/cZaUQ5l6H4
.@HUDgov's failure to meet Sept. deadline to re-post #LGBT resources is unacceptable. Every day this guidance is unavailable to #housing service providers puts more lives at risk.   Read my letter with @NitaLowey @RepDavidEPrice @RepKClark @RepPeteAguilar: https://t.co/zdojxi6jmJ
#Housing discrimination in the #LGBT community is not a small problem. Did you know: an estimated 40% of homeless youth identify as LGBT &amp; nearly 30% of #transgender Americans say that they have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives? https://t.co/JhpUFOuqSm
.@SecretaryCarson had a Sept. 19 deadline to review &amp; re-publish #LGBT housing resources on the @HUDgov website—resources that were deleted in early 2017.  That deadline has come &amp; gone and this vital nondiscrimination guidance is still missing. https://t.co/zdojxi6jmJ

I applaud @Amazon for doing the right thing: raising its #minimumwage to $15 an hour, benefiting as many as 350,000 employees who deserve a livable wage to support themselves &amp; their families. Time for Congress to follow suit &amp; pass the #RaiseTheWage Act. https://t.co/WvDqetYlzV
They really know how to make an already horrific &amp; inhumane situation that much worse...   Uprooting migrant children in the middle of the night &amp; moving them to a crowded, unlicensed "tent city" is not a solution to our nation's #immigration challenges. https://t.co/j1A33PB8NH
Bigoted #UN announcement will force "those living in countries without marriage equality to choose between a posting at UN headquarters or family separation" via @hrw.  Seems as if the Trump Admin is growing quite the affinity for tearing apart families. https://t.co/wZ137RxQTp
This unnecessary, discriminatory shift serves 1 purpose: to advance the Admin's appalling record on #LGBTQ rights. They have offered no explanation &amp; that’s because there isn't one—It’s simply a hateful, regressive decision that moves our country backward. https://t.co/XzAlEZc0NA

Lead in school drinking water poses an invisible yet grave threat to our children—a threat that demands the immediate attention of every parent, citizen &amp; level of government. That’s why @RepLawrence &amp; I introduced the “Get the Lead Out of Schools Act” https://t.co/NIetnUsYVh

Proud to sign the below letter on behalf of Dr. Ford &amp; survivors everywhere.   It's unconscionable that Senate Republicans would move forward w/ this confirmation process without an FBI investigation, without subpoenaing Mark Judge, without doing their due diligence or their job. https://t.co/qhDMX1JCf9

I've been pushing for greater public access to Congressional Research Reports since 2011.   Starting today, I am excited to say these taxpayer-funded, policy analysis reports will finally be shared with the American people via one central website. https://t.co/LdcU79RCd8
With every thinly veiled (&amp; unsuccessful) attempt to save face, President Trump shows the American public just how willing he is to sacrifice our national security &amp; undermine the institutions that keep us safe. https://t.co/Z8mspvZPSa
The disturbing, credible allegations against Judge Kavanaugh must be taken with all seriousness.  ICYMI, read our letter to all U.S. Senators urging the delay of any vote until a thorough investigation of the allegations has taken place: https://t.co/j8nbrhX1Xn
Declassifying materials related to an ongoing investigation is another abuse of power by the president. By cherry-picking documents, Trump will try to advance his "Witch Hunt" narrative, but to any sane person: these aren't the actions of an innocent man. https://t.co/8Ye9aCjWqJ
Today, I was pleased to join @RepRobinKelly, @janschakowsky &amp; other #Chicago leaders &amp; #healthcare advocates to discuss these findings &amp; the ongoing need to protect reliable access to quality, affordable care. #ACA   Read my remarks here: https://t.co/ZvvwBotAd3 https://t.co/yV07lNNC1z
Republicans’ political efforts to undermine the #ACA &amp; reduce coverage are tired, despicable &amp; unacceptable. Click here for a troubling new report on the impacts of their discriminatory policies that would roll back #PreExistingCondition protections:  https://t.co/gNNb7EL2HK https://t.co/8cHvvkSgtT
NEW REPORT: If the Trump Administration succeeds in its partisan efforts to strip key #ACA provisions, +250,000 people in #CookCounty could lose federal protections against coverage denials or premium increases as a result of their #PreExistingConditions, gender, or age. #IL05
A big congratulations to the 15 schools in #Illinois that made @HealthierGen's list of America's #HealthiestSchools. We must never stop working to improve our kids' health &amp; safety, especially in the classroom. Check out all the award winners at https://t.co/ERJDz6pkAF.
@theGSpledge @UChicago I met with @UChicago to learn more about the successful initiviates they have implemented &amp; to discuss ways our government &amp; other schools can help lower the cost. https://t.co/FXNa5MO294
In August, I met w/ #students &amp; faculty at @UChicago to discuss how we can reduce the price tag for #college, especially for low-income or first generation students. Stories like these remind us why it's so vital to make #HigherEd affordable &amp; accessible: https://t.co/tYWCq7G8og

After ignoring the intelligence community’s warning on #election #hacking for years, now President Trump wants to acknowledge the threat? This executive order is no substitute for real legislative action, and unfortunately, we remain completely unprepared. https://t.co/rr5dBkGwj5
Pres. Trump has made it crystal clear that he could care less about protecting our elections from foreign interference—If he was serious about defending our democracy, he would have addressed these attacks a long, long time ago. https://t.co/Pm9Wxj1tX5 #ElectionSecurity
If Trump Admin cuts @FCC phone subsidies for low-income individuals, it will undoubtedly put #domesticviolence victims at increased risk—Stripping away this resource &amp; undermining their ability to call for help is downright heartless #LifelineForSurvivors https://t.co/fliRRGP3xI
The overall number of detained migrant children has exploded to the highest ever recorded, placing unbelievable strain on shelter systems. Time for the Trump Admin to move away from its inhumane preference for detainment &amp; work to unite these families. https://t.co/TMmv8xvM8S
Today, I'll work to ensure our government stays open &amp; that our appropriations process isn’t manipulated to undermine Wall Street regulations, weaken wildlife protections, diminish access to fair &amp; equitable housing, or strip $ from infrastructure projects https://t.co/JJOJez3JKy
Unfortunately, instead of governing responsibly and in the best interest of those they represent, Republicans want to misuse must-pass legislation to fund our government as a means to advance their partisan agenda.
From transportation &amp; housing to enviro protections that ensure clean air &amp; water, I'm proud to play a key role in securing the spending priorities that matter most to #Chicago families as 1 of 6 Democrats selected to serve on today's conference committee. https://t.co/DtAOFyrUgQ

Terrible for clean air, public health &amp; our climate.   The Trump Admin is hell-bent on undoing Obama's environmental legacy by making it easier to release methane into the atmosphere &amp; making it clear that they could care less about the consequences. https://t.co/8Q1EaBkkxI

In the midst of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference, Trump's SCOTUS pick refuses to take a stance on presidential self-pardons.

Republicans have worked hand in glove with the President of the United States to obstruct this investigation. https://t.co/cKDf8lf4TA
HAYES: Why it is more important than Watergate?   QUIGLEY: Because it involves a foreign adversary and the very real possibility that our President conspired with them to attack our democratic process.   HAYES: You assess that as a very real possibility?   QUIGLEY: I do. https://t.co/UQ3zbEfmpr
87% of Americans agree automakers should continue to improve vehicle efficiency, but @realDonaldTrump wants to rollback #CleanerCars standards. This reckless decision will expose us to dangerous carbon pollution &amp; increase our payment at the pump. https://t.co/riwUQ13ydl
Stop by my #IL05 rotating office hours today until 3pm in River Grove (Village Hall: 2621 N. Thatcher Ave)! https://t.co/HoIavHFgIX
This can’t get any more clear: the majority of Republicans simply don’t care about the threat posed by our foreign adversaries or the steps needed to harden our defenses. They’re showing where their loyalty lies, and right now it’s with the President—not the American people. https://t.co/bJsZCnjac6
In 10 minutes, I’ll join @NewDay to talk about President Trump’s panic &amp; paranoia surrounding the Russia investigation. Tune in to @CNN at 7:15ct/8:15est.

Mueller’s recent indictment of 12 Russian officers, including those who conspired to hack state election systems, only further reinforces #Illinois’ need to upgrade cybersecurity defenses. Read our letter to @GovRauner on the need to #EndCrosscheck: https://t.co/m5BC5qF0s7
Flawed security protocols that export voter data, including partial social security numbers, expose millions of #IL voters to hackers &amp; identity thieves. We can better defend voters &amp; our electoral process if we #EndCrosscheck. https://t.co/d0hhlCXSgv
Earlier this month, @GovRauner vetoed legislation to remove #Illinois from the Interstate Voter Registration #Crosscheck System.  I led a letter urging him to strongly reconsider our participation in this vulnerable system that doesn't protect #IL #voters. https://t.co/m5BC5qWBjF
From our president &amp; elected officials to tech employees &amp; concerned citizens—all Americans must play a role in defending our democracy against misinformation. We must continue to take steps to identify malicious activity &amp; address vulnerabilities that make the attacks possible. https://t.co/HpH4OMCIXm
These 32 accounts represent just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to foreign actors' willingness to weaponize social media in order to degrade our democracy.   Their attempts to influence our elections &amp; exploit our differences won't stop here. https://t.co/aN54qH8YRX
How will the Trump Administration even attempt to justify this as anything other than a massive, sickening, life-threatening giveaway to the #NRA? https://t.co/KS7lGQ3GiT #3DGuns
As if our nation's unprecedented #GunViolence epidemic wasn't terrifying enough, President Trump wants to introduce "ghost guns," which even metal detectors can't spot.

Last week, I was proud to cosponsor the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act #VAWA. First enacted in 1994, this landmark legislation is as important as ever in addressing our nation’s crisis of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault &amp; stalking.
In 2016, 22 million people traveled to the US from Visa Waiver Program countries &amp; these travelers generated more than $90 billion for the US economy. My bipartisan #JOLTAct legislation supports this massive economic driver: https://t.co/Ddjrvjfuto

Now more than ever, we must strengthen our ability to identify foreign influence &amp; ensure that foreign actors seeking to lobby the United States government are held just as accountable as any other lobbyist. #Transparency
As co-chair &amp; co-founder of the #Transparency Caucus, I'm proud to bring issues of government #accountability to the forefront.   Today, I hosted a briefing on the need to shine a light on foreign #lobbying, which is particularly relevant considering Paul Manafort's indictment. https://t.co/ys86Nnjx1O
We need to ask ourselves what really keeps America safe in today's world: Is it unnecessary &amp; ineffective immigration detention or is it smart programs like the Urban Area Security Initiative? Read more about my amendment in support of UASI: https://t.co/Iq42OiCBrL
Instead, we should invest in alternatives to #ICE's #detention programs. They save money, but much more importantly, they treat people seeking safety &amp; opportunity with the dignity that they deserve. https://t.co/QhIatmGU6f
Chain-link fences, filthy mattresses on the floor, inadequate health care, lack of nutritious food—this is the standard in #detention facilities today. According to one 17-year-old boy from Honduras, detainees are treated "worse than dogs."
My amendment decreases funding for immigration #detention beds to match the FY18 level &amp; puts these savings into Urban Area Security Initiative grant program, which helps large cities like #Chicago invest in the training &amp; equipment to respond to their unique security challenges.
Today, I offered an amendment to the #HomelandSecurity #appropriations bill in order to to combat #ICE’s inhumane &amp; ineffective detention policy. Despite President Trump's affinity for locking up families, detention isn’t the only option when it comes to #immigration enforcement.
Great to meet w/ @3musketeers Shine Corp Ambassador, Britain Bennett, for an important conversation on how young Americans can use positivity to bridge differences &amp; find solutions.

If your Representative voted NO on responsible funding to help defend our electoral process from foreign attacks, I encourage you to ask them why.   You can find out here (&amp; then connect by dialing 202-224-3121): https://t.co/VoP99SwT6P https://t.co/ro1F9RAqiR
Republicans had a chance to do the right thing, equipped with the new revelations from the Mueller investigation &amp; the realization that President Trump will do absolutely nothing to defend our election systems from foreign interference. They rejected that chance. https://t.co/QUvXMoUZ3p
Well, there you have it. Republicans just showed us where they stand by voting to ZERO out my #EAC funding amendment that would help us protect our #election infrastructure against foreign attacks. https://t.co/8MehKr6gK6
Republicans have rejected my amendment on a voice vote. So now, I'm demanding a recorded vote. The American people deserve to know which side their Representatives are on. https://t.co/TiVo5ept1H
HAPPENING NOW: Tune in to the House Floor, I'm offering the Democratic Motion to Recommit on election security funding. Let's see if Republicans vote to protect our elections &amp; our democracy.
@myshaela @CongressRTBot "In March 2018, Congress provided the Election Assistance Commission with $380 million in funding for election assistance grants to states. These are steps that we've taken to prevent it from happening. These are steps that we have taken because we see there is a threat there.”
@davetz76 "In March 2018, Congress provided the Election Assistance Commission with $380 million in funding for election assistance grants to states. These are steps that we've taken to prevent it from happening. These are steps that we have taken because we see there is a threat there.”
Republicans have no excuse for intentionally degrading the integrity of our elections &amp; the security of our democratic process. If they really want to safeguard our democracy, they will vote in favor of my amendment to restore $$ for  #ElectionSecurity grants.
Now, it is time for Republicans to accept &amp; act on this obvious truth: Russian interference in our elections is a grave national security threat.  Tomorrow, I'll give Republicans a second chance to help us address that threat by restoring $ for the Election Assistance Commission.
Even @PressSec Sarah Huckabee Sanders has acknowledged the common-sense fact that funding for #ElectionSecurity grants, which allow states to update &amp; upgrade their outdated election infrastructure, is a positive step forward in preventing foreign meddling. https://t.co/GwNACoos4J
I never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I encourage Republicans to listen to what Sarah Huckabee Sanders just said: https://t.co/mymmVjUHHP
Republicans on the Floor are claiming that 19 states have yet to request funding for election security in FY18. This is 100% false.   Every single state requested $$$ to harden their defenses against election meddling. https://t.co/Fbn7oqaXdM
We know for certain that states are using this money, as all 50 states requested EAC funding. In fact, these states, including my home state of #Illinois, need even more than they received in FY18. We should be doing much, much more than this. Take a look: https://t.co/2qwOpYklqB
We must remain committed to ensuring that states &amp; localities have the funding and resources necessary to remediate lead in their schools &amp; throughout their drinking water systems. And this must include consistent testing.  Read more about the new report: https://t.co/TmKJ3Zcr1U
No child should be put at risk for toxic lead exposure simply by drinking water at school.  To address the GAO findings, the Admin should finalize a stronger Lead &amp; Copper Rule and issue protective guidance requiring lead testing for all public schools. https://t.co/O8OCwDwUar
ICYMI: I released a @USGAO report that found only 43% of #school districts nationwide tested for lead in their schools’ drinking water in 2016 &amp; 2017, and of those that tested, 37% found elevated lead levels.   This report must serve as a wake-up call to the Trump WH &amp; Congress. https://t.co/5fWBPEgcyc
Did you know: -40 states have election equipment that is over a decade old -13 states use equipment that doesn't even produce a paper trail  -9,000 entities operate federal elections nationwide   It's time to update our infrastructure &amp; our security: https://t.co/RxlP0bA76S
I've introduced an amendment to fund election security grants that defend our democratic process from Russia's influence. It's time for Republicans to do something. They can start by passing my amendment: https://t.co/RxlP0bA76S https://t.co/mpcB8in04u
You’re two years too late. And even more importantly, you’re 24 hours too late.   @realDonaldTrump, you had the opportunity to bring this up YESTERDAY. Instead, you praised &amp; defended a foreign adversary who wishes us harm. https://t.co/xN2DgAJHOU
Where was this yesterday when you were standing right next to the man who ordered the attack? https://t.co/yKJPkn0kcl
@AP_Politics @AP Where was this yesterday when you were standing next to the man who ordered the attack?
This week, I will introduce an amendment to restore critical funding for #electionsecurity. Funding ($380 million, to be exact) that I secured for FY2018, and funding that Republicans then zeroed out for 2019. The GOP must decide which side it’s on. https://t.co/8pBjQRMYeJ
In particular, I'll discuss my ongoing efforts to fund #electionsecurity grants to update our outdated election infrastructure. It's time for Republicans to put the American people before their political party &amp; work to keep us safe. https://t.co/QJLzebLmPs

During today's #TreasonSummit, President Trump threw our nation under the bus in defense of 1) his own image 2) a foreign adversary who wants to destroy our way of life.   The President has a funny way of putting "America First." https://t.co/Bpl7cLUA7M
From annexing Crimea &amp; invading Ukraine to supporting Assad &amp; poising journalists, this is #Putin’s legacy. And today, President Trump stood by this man's side &amp; said both of our countries are responsible. #TreasonSummit https://t.co/52isK15Y0c
#Russia hacked our elections in a direct attempt to undermine our democracy, weaken our institutions, and sow division amongst us.   Trump's response: "We're all to blame."

Next week, during consideration of the FSGG approps bill, I'll re-introduce my amendment to equip states w/ the $$ they need to harden their defenses &amp; it is my hope that in light of today’s indictments, Republicans step up to safeguard our democracy from those who wish us harm. https://t.co/WTXudrfU4Z
Republicans in Congress also refuse to recognize these vulnerabilities as a legitimate threat, and in doing so, intentionally reversed course to zero out $380 million in #electionsecurity grants, which I worked to secure in the FY18 omnibus bill. https://t.co/LR64lPCcni
Unfortunately, I suspect that today’s announcement will only lead to more of the president’s thinly-veiled, partisan attacks on the integrity of our Justice Department—not an honest acknowledgement of the real national security crisis at hand. https://t.co/vk4OMVPYlo
For almost 2yrs, I’ve been saying our #election infrastructure is nowhere near where it needs to be to inspire confidence in our democratic process. The #indictment of 12 Russian agents, who conspired to hack Democrats &amp; US election systems, only reinforces our vulnerabilities.
A dozen Russian intelligence officers are charged with conspiring to hack Democrats &amp; U.S. election systems.  How does @realDonaldTrump respond? By continuing with plans to meet Vladimir Putin, who ordered the attack. https://t.co/rjDK8KtbI8
New report identifies 18 states with that are most vulnerable to election hacking. #Illinois is is among the most at-risk.   This is serious. That's why I've worked to secure $ for election security grants &amp; have intro'd legislation to harden our defenses. https://t.co/gH0ZJ3ol61

#Illinois ranks 18th in maternal mortality with 16.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. In our state, black women have 3.5x higher mortality rates than white women and black infants have nearly 3x higher mortality rates than white infants—far worse than the national average.
It is unconscionable that Republicans are using the process in which we fund our government to discriminate against qualified, credible &amp; compassionate Americans who want to help vulnerable children. Once again, GOP is putting partisan policy before the wellbeing of kids in need. https://t.co/9W7N7V535T
Today, during our Labor-HHS #appropriations markup, House Rs supported a bill allowing child welfare &amp; placement orgs to discriminate against prospective parents from adopting or fostering children on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, or religion.

We must treat this often surprising &amp; entirely heartbreaking statistic as a call to action. Potentially lifesaving research—made possible by new $$ in this bill—can help identify the root causes &amp; trends of maternal death to protect more women &amp; families in the years to come.
More American women are dying of pregnancy-related complications than any other country in the developed world, with an approx 700-900 annual deaths &amp; thousands of women experiencing near fatal complications after childbirth. Only in the US is the rate of death actually rising.
Today, I was proud to join my colleague @HerreraBeutler in securing $2 million in funding for @CDCgov efforts to prevent maternal deaths through state-based Maternal Mortality Review Committees. https://t.co/BC1nUVoahb

Trump’s suggestion that he’s comfortable with non-nuclear countries—like Japan, South Korea &amp; Saudi Arabia—gaining nuclear capabilities are as disturbing as they are dangerous. We cannot affirm his misguided logic that proliferation is inevitable &amp; is good for the United States. https://t.co/FHgU50K43v

During my visit at the children’s shelter today, we had a phone call w/ @HHSGov. Unfortunately, the details on family reunification remain as hazy as they were weeks ago. The Trump Admin must put together a real plan—&amp; now—to rectify the inhumane chaos its own policy has created.
Make no mistake: the bright, kind children I met today are fleeing persecution &amp; violence—We shouldn't be making their journey to safety &amp; opportunity more dangerous &amp; traumatizing than it already is by enacting a zero-tolerance policy that destroys families #KeepFamiliesTogether
Today, I joined @janschakowsky &amp; @RepBillFoster at an immigrant children’s shelter in #Chicago, where unaccompanied minors &amp; kids who were separated from their parents are living—If my visit reinforced 1 thing, it's that these young people are coming to America for a better life.

Beyond pleased that perhaps the most corrupt cabinet official in US history has finally resigned—He should never have been appointed to the post &amp; should have been fired long, long ago.

#JulyFourth is a prime opportunity to reflect on our nation’s founding ideals &amp; principles that make America great. Happy to celebrate those values &amp; this holiday with friends at the #Sauganash event this afternoon. #IL05 https://t.co/GJu8JSAH1T
An outright assault on #diversity, inclusion &amp; opportunity for all. This disastrous decision undermines decades-long commitment to #AffirmativeAction &amp; will have decades-long consequences for future generations of #students who make our country stronger. https://t.co/h5B4VHMaAm
To those who took part in the #citizenship oath ceremony, I hope you look back on this day not just as the day you became citizens—but as the day you became active &amp; engaged citizens: fully invested participants in democracy who vote, volunteer &amp; who, perhaps, run for office. https://t.co/BW7jidg0ti
Everyone here today brings a unique story &amp; unique contributions to our democracy. But 1 thing that binds them together is that they’ve all come to this country in search of a better life.

Curious about the #QuigleyClimateTour?   I’m at @IndianaDunesNPS right in #Chicago’s backyard to learn more about increasing temperatures, changing weather patterns, invasive species, native plant populations—and how all are being influenced by #ClimateChange. https://t.co/ev4BVJk6tn
@parkridgean @kcbyrne @IndianaDunesNPS These dramatic swings cause extreme erosion, damaging and challenging all kinds of species living along the #GreatLakes. It’s not that the lakes are higher; it’s how quickly they bounce from high to low and supercharge existing cycles. #QuigleyClimateTour
@parkridgean @kcbyrne @IndianaDunesNPS Thanks for asking! Typically, cycles of water levels in the #GreatLakes run about 20 years, leading to predictable &amp; safe erosion that helps maintain the dunes. However, in the last 5 years, we’ve seen historic low lake levels &amp; near historic highs. #QuigleyClimateTour
Last summer, this observation deck had 20 feet of sand behind it. Today, it’s on the beach—destroyed thanks to extreme weather &amp; rising water levels. #QuigleyClimateTour @IndianaDunesNPS https://t.co/xhFMHZ6cWm

Senator McConnell should respect his own precedent &amp; delay voting on Trump’s Supreme Court nomination until after the election. The American people are watching and will not sit idly by as the values, rights &amp; opportunities we hold dear come under attack. https://t.co/ExDE81vgaE
We cannot allow the next Justice, chosen on the basis of powerful special interests or Trump loyalty, to reverse the progress Americans have spent decades fighting for. #SaveSCOTUS

Conservatives must stop attacking workers &amp; start helping create a system that benefits everyone. I'll continue to partner w/ Dems to defend unions &amp; support legislative solutions that give all public-sector workers the freedom to stand together &amp; negotiate for fair conditions.
By increasing the number of free riding workers, #unions could be forced to drastically reduce their budgets, which in turn weakens their ability to negotiate stronger contracts and defend the rights of American workers who deserve a fair wage and a fair workplace. #JANUSvsAFSCME https://t.co/TY6shlArzl
Today’s flawed #JANUSvsAFSCME decision is just another example in a litany of instances where conservative judges, Republican elected officials, &amp; their donors have attempted to rig the economy against hardworking Americans for the benefit of billionaires. https://t.co/X44WshyabN
As a proud Chicagoan, I understand the role #unions play in rebuilding our shrinking middle class.   #JANUSvsAFSCME #SCOTUS ruling just reversed 41yrs of precedent to undermine the freedom of our laborers, teachers, police officers, firefighters, factory &amp; transportation workers.
An important #ICYMI for @HouseGOP &amp; @realDonaldTrump:  65% of those polled said a candidate’s support for continued protections for people with #PreExistingConditions is either the “single most important factor” or “very important” in their vote. https://t.co/haUYUU9XWC
Whether it’s getting a job or an education, accessing the news or expressing yourself online—A free &amp; open #Internet is essential to the success of our nation. We need to restore #NetNeutrality &amp; I applaud the concerned &amp; committed citizens participating in today's Day of Action.
Small biz rely on #NetNeutrality to connect with customers nationwide—These entrepreneurs use the Internet as an equal playing field to compete w/ larger corporations.  That's just one reason I signed a discharge petition to force a vote on #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/YdThxVsFto

The Intelligence Community has determined that at least 21 state #election systems were targeted in the lead-up to 2016.   Now, we must join together &amp; step up to identify the vulnerabilities that exist so we can implement infrastructure upgrades that address them head on.
Unfortunately, many state &amp; local election boards don’t even know when they’ve been hacked—either because they don’t know what to look for or don’t have the #tech needed to help spot an intrusion. The new bipartisan bill I intro'd w/ @RepJohnKatko will improve our understanding.
Russia &amp; other foreign actors who wish us harm don’t have to hack into every single board of election to undermine our democratic process; it just takes a couple to achieve their goal of eroding public trust in our electoral system.
Today, I was proud to introduce the Prevent #Election #Hacking Act of 2018 to combat the threat posed by foreign adversaries—This bipartisan bill creates a new competition that rewards #cybersecurity experts who are able to identify vulnerabilities in our election infrastructure.
Let #WorldRefugeeDay serve as a critical &amp; timely reminder on the need to maintain our role as a beacon of hope for those fleeing persecution and violence. We can &amp; must do better. https://t.co/5DbZ7dVzd3
Congress must stand up to the President as he pulls families apart, using children as bargaining chips. The Appropriations Committee must be willing to use the power of the purse—and withhold the funding needed to implement these draconian policies. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Just this week, Secretary Nielsen demonstrated just how out of touch #DHS is as it relates to this immoral policy. We are not in the business of building expensive, ineffective walls. We are not in the business of turning away asylum seekers. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Republicans support the President’s requested funding levels, which prioritize Trump’s cruel immigration policies with a dramatic increase for the Department of Homeland Security. #FamiliesBelongTogether
The President’s statements have effectively obscured and distracted from the emergency at hand. Make no mistake: this is Trump’s policy; is not a law that must be enforced. It is a choice being made everyday by this Administration. #FamiliesBelongTogether
#Appropriations Democrats are using the end of the State &amp; Foreign operations markup to speak out against Trump’s abhorrent family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether
I’ve also urged appropriators overseeing #DHS to ensure that the agency cannot use appropriated funds to separate families seeking safety. You can read my letter here: https://t.co/ea6fVtOIBD https://t.co/uTkZ59nUQh
For starters, I’ve cosponsored a bill that: -Prohibits DHS separation unless parental rights have been terminated or being with the parent keeps the child in danger -requires border patrol officials to undergo annual child welfare training -develops procedures to reunite families https://t.co/uTkZ59nUQh
In less than a week, my office has received 645 calls, emails &amp; letters from constituents expressing their strong opposition to family separation—This isn’t smart #immigration policy; it’s just callous.  Thank you for making your voice heard on the need to #KeepFamiliesTogether.

Russia’s work is not done &amp; neither should our efforts to counter their actions. My amendment would provide $$ to improve cybersecurity defenses &amp; update election infrastructure so our foreign adversaries can't undermine the integrity of our democracy. https://t.co/f60TRvyD2k
For the last 2yrs, I’ve been sounding the alarm that our election infrastructure is outdated, low-tech &amp; nowhere near where it needs to be to prevent future intrusions from foreign adversaries. That is why I intro'd an amendment to provide $380M in grants to #ProtectOurDemocracy.
The FSGG bill would also interfere in the local affairs of the District: repealing law allowing DC to use its own funds w/o Congressional approval, prohibiting funds for DC needle exchange programs, blocking local legalization of marijuana, banning DC’s Death w/ Dignity Act &amp;more
The CDFI fund is inexplicably cut by $59 million in this bill. This means fewer resources to spur economic growth &amp; revitalization in our most underserved &amp; neglected communities. Cutting a bipartisan program by +20% means less affordable housing &amp; key infrastructure.
The SEC, which is tasked with protecting investors and ensuring fairness in our capital markets, is cut by over $200 million, even though the commission’s budget is financed by industry fees, not taxpayer funds.
After losing over a billion dollars in funding and 18,000 staff between 2010 and 2017, Republicans have reversed course and have begun providing IRS with additional funding to implement their new tax law. Yet, taxpayer service is cut by $15 million.
As Ranking Member of the #FinancialServices &amp; General Government #Appropriations Subcommittee, I voiced my strong opposition to the FY19 FSGG bill.  Filled with controversial riders, it doesn’t meet the growing needs of our small biz &amp; taxpayers. Read why: https://t.co/OiI2qotkS0

Beyond a self-serving photo-op, the only thing to definitively come from the summit was increased uncertainty for South Korea. By conceding to the Kim regime &amp; ending joint military exercises, the Trump Administration has undermined a key component of Seoul’s defense strategy.
The President had one goal for this meeting: achieve complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. Instead, he received vague commitments from Kim Jong-un, which only underscore Trump’s lack of strategy and unpreparedness for this summit.
I will always support diplomacy first—the world is complicated &amp; we must be willing to engage with our adversaries and our enemies alike. Unfortunately, yesterday’s summit in Singapore was less about substantive diplomatic talks as it was about ineffectual political theatre.
Our schools should always be a safe place for students to learn &amp; grow. More must be done—at both the state and federal level—to advance child-protection measures. Catch my thoughts here: https://t.co/FsyDGI6bLz

My amendment would introduce some much-needed #transparency into the #EPA Administrator’s travel and its cost to the taxpayer—without compromising security. RT if you support this &amp; other common-sense policies that hold government officials accountable.
Unfortunately, the #EPA led by Administrator Pruitt is ground zero for violations of the public trust. That is why I introduced a good-governance Interior appropriations amendment that requires disclosure of the Administrator’s travel costs.

This #LGBTQ #PrideMonth, we honor the generations of leaders &amp; advocates who championed the values of opportunity, fairness &amp; justice and were unwavering in their courage to fight for what is right. We thank you, and we will continue to build upon the progress you've made. https://t.co/a3gX9kGwoi
The first pride parade took place in 1970 to commemorate the #StonewallRiots in New York. Almost 50 years later, what was once a moment has transformed into a movement, which continues to bring people together in the ongoing battle to secure #equalrights for all. #PrideMonth
ICYMI: Trump repeatedly pressured AG Sessions on the Mueller investigation &amp; mused about whether it would be possible to limit the scope to avoid his business affairs... https://t.co/JAYWWY6nM3 https://t.co/mf70Up4vTl
It’s been one year since the president caved to malevolent advisors, corporate polluters, and his own ignorance on #climatechange and decided to withdraw the US from the historic #ParisAgreement. Today, more than ever before, we know that the change we seek is on our shoulders. https://t.co/iBC8IUkZzs
One year ago today—when Trump pulled the US out of the #ParisAgreement—I was standing at an overlook at the top of Rocky Mountain National Park during my #climatechange tour.   I wrote an op-ed reflecting on that day, the past year &amp; where we go from here: https://t.co/ZlJ2QeXKL5
The bipartisan, bicameral Flood Mapping Modernization &amp; Homeowner Empowerment Pilot Program Act I introduced in April will help give cities &amp; towns the tools they need to address #flooding &amp; better protect residents. Read more: https://t.co/Cv9shNH69D
ICYMI: Heavy rains in a short time brought #flooding throughout the suburbs, trapping cars and prompting a rescue by boat.   Recent extreme weather in #Chicago underscores the importance of my urban flooding bill to improve mapping &amp; prevent destruction. https://t.co/ZhuUuzlArg
For the past 8yrs, the #HealthCare Rights Law has prohibited providers from: •Refusing to treat someone who is transgender •Refusing to treat a woman because she had an abortion •Refusing to care for a newborn because the parents are gay •Sexually assault or harass patients
Sent a letter to @MickMulvaneyOMB in strong opposition to any attempts to roll back the Health Care Rights Law. Passed as part of the #ACA, the #HealthCare Rights Law protects patients from discrimination in care, including based on sex or gender identity. https://t.co/qgbWUejxVe
70% of unintentional child deaths could have been prevented if the firearm had been stored unloaded &amp; in a locked cabinet or gun safe. That is why Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws are so crucial. Read more: https://t.co/HqSm0UsaDJ
To encourage safe gun storage practices and prevent injuries &amp; deaths, I’m proud to cosponsor the the Child Gun Access Prevention Act, which would provide $ to states that enact laws holding adults criminally liable if they allow unsecured firearms to be accessible to children. https://t.co/OF4e52xBiZ

Our condolences mean absolutely nothing if they are not followed up by substantive action on #gunviolence prevention. They do not stop dangerous individuals from obtaining access to firearms. They do not prevent the next school massacre. Simply put, they do not protect our kids.
Smaller government? Not when it comes to women’s #healthcare. Now Trump is using the gov to dictate what doctors can tell their patients.   RT to tell this Administration: #NoGagRule, which will only serve to shut down providers &amp; cut vital services. https://t.co/KiEQQMnmnO

The evidence of collusion is not fading; it is flourishing. That is why I am calling on Chairman Nunes &amp; Speaker Ryan to reopen our HPSCI investigation and finally join Democrats in playing an authentic, active role in our search for answers. https://t.co/UNTj5jOTFU
By choosing to prematurely end the committee’s investigation into Russian meddling in our election, House Republicans are allowing the safety and security of our country to take a backseat to a self-perceived, short-term political victory.
The ever-growing web of connections between the president’s inner circle and Russian officials is no coincidence. Unfortunately, HPSCI Republicans have decided to ignore these blatant links and dismiss all instances of consequential communication—and now direct payment.
Less than a week after the public learned that Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg was questioned by Mueller, we also became aware that the same oligarch paid Michael Cohen $500k—adding to list of troubling revelations made since Republicans shut down HPSCI Russia Investigation
In the absence of sound Presidential leadership, Congress must step in to fill the void &amp; uphold our commitments to defend national and global security alike.   Read my full statement on the president’s decision to withdraw from the #IranDeal: https://t.co/VVDiCJCBju
The US should embrace the opportunity to lead a more comprehensive, international strategy towards Iran, North Korea &amp; all countries with nuclear aspirations. We must move together in an effort to abolish nuclear weapons &amp; promote a global policy of non-proliferation. #IranDeal
As we prepare to break this pledge that will only serve to destabilize the region, our European partners have made it clear that they will stay a party to JCPOA, further isolating America from the world and the vital decision-making that determines our shared fate.  #IranDeal https://t.co/M1anrkYGdR
The credibility of the United States must be maintained in both word &amp; action, and when we walk away from the table, our integrity is seriously damaged. In turn, we weaken our ability to lead effective change elsewhere in the world. #IranDeal https://t.co/VVDiCJCBju
The decision to walk away from the #IranDeal will not only impact our relationship with Iran &amp; spur a ripple of consequences across the Middle East, but it will also affect our ongoing negotiations with #NorthKorea.
Trump’s decision to pull out of the #IranDeal is dangerous, shortsighted, and will make America—and our allies—less safe.   Despite the deceptive rhetoric &amp; degradation of the JCPOA by its critics, the facts remain: JCPOA is working &amp; is containing #Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

I just asked @AjitPaiFCC: Did Trump or other WH officials or transition team discuss #Sinclair, both generally or about a proposed Sinclair-Tribune merger, with you or your staff before the announcement?  His answer: "not to my knowledge."   We've been hearing this a lot lately.
I just asked @AjitPaiFCC: Have you recused yourself, or do you plan on recusing yourself, from further actions related to the #Sinclair-#Tribune merger until the IG investigation has concluded?  His answer, simply put: "no."

From denying the existence of #climatechange &amp; attempting to roll back Obama’s efforts to curtail emissions to politicizing science &amp; scientific advisory boards, #PollutingPruitt has never missed an opportunity to sell out the mission of the #EPA to benefit corporate polluters.
Last week, I pressed Mulvaney about OMB's involvement in responding to complaints about ethical concerns &amp; inappropriate spending at EPA &amp; HUD.

HAPPENING NOW: Taking questions from @DePaulU #journalism students about the polarization of news sources &amp; importance of consuming information relaying opposing views. https://t.co/qwAOcAemLs https://t.co/LTP69nSLT4
A free &amp; independent press remains a fundamental pillar of our democracy.   Excited to be at @DePaulU today to hear directly from the next generation of journalists about the role they believe the press plays in our 21st-century democracy. WATCH: https://t.co/qwAOcAemLs
STARTING SHORTLY: At 10 a.m. CT, I'll visit @DePaulU &amp; meet with #Journalism students for an open discussion on freedom of the press, #FakeNews &amp; the role of media in the Trump Administration. You can watch our conversation at https://t.co/VltUmDDG0P.
A giveaway for the logging industry disguised as bad policy: https://t.co/FePz6KpOuJ  Simply put, this will lead to more destruction of  US land &amp; more pollution of dangerous carbon.
Another day, another major conflict of interest for #PollutingPruitt.   It has been crystal clear for months that Scott Pruitt lacks the leadership, initiative, and judgement needed to head the #EPA. https://t.co/ZAmcHRzD6P
In a world with so many pressing challenges &amp; awful injustices to face and address, this is how the Trump Administration wants to spend its time. Despicable.   via @nytimes: "Trump Plan Would Cut Back #HealthCare Protections for #Transgender People" https://t.co/Ee1xfcdyuT
8 yrs ago today, the exploratory oil rig #DeepwaterHorizon exploded. It was the worst environmental disaster in US history, devastating Gulf of Mexico’s marine life &amp; coastal communities.   @SecretaryZinke must #ProtectOurCoast &amp; reverse radical plan to expand dangerous drilling. https://t.co/97nWpaIbhC
Recent efforts at the Department of Justice with regard to U.S. #immigration courts raise serious concerns about DOJ’s commitment to fairness, due process, and constitutional requirements. Read more: https://t.co/56qYtFLKTT
In our letter, @RepJoseSerrano, @NitaLowey &amp; I explain that these programs provide individuals in detention with essential in-person briefings on immigration court procedures and basic legal info &amp; resources, all while saving our #immigration courts time &amp; money.
Under the guise of a typical audit, DOJ is terminating the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) &amp; Immigration Court Help Desk program. Previous audits of LOP did not require an interruption of operations &amp; the last audit found that it saved the government nearly $18 million over 1yr.
Today, I led a letter to AG Jeff Sessions objecting to the Justice Department’s decision to terminate two programs that provide vital legal assistance to detained #immigrants facing deportation. Over 100 House Democrats signed the letter; read here: https://t.co/56qYtFLKTT
We must use the vast resources at our disposal to advance comprehensive #immigration reform, not coercive funding conditions, which are ineffective and harmful to anyone living in a ‘sanctuary’ city—citizen or not.   Read more about my bill: https://t.co/cNA2VjHiha
A victory for our nation's founding ideals, rooted in equality &amp; opportunity for all.

This ruling deals a major blow to the Trump Admin's intolerant &amp; dangerous anti-immigrant agenda. It confirms what Democrats have been saying all along: DOJ cannot withhold public safety funding from #SanctuaryCities that protect #immigrants in search of the #AmericanDream. https://t.co/g8Z1E9a3qg

ICYMI: I pressed @MickMulvaneyOMB about OMB's involvement in responding to complaints about spending at @EPA &amp; @HUDgov related to the purchase of Scott #Pruitt’s soundproof booth &amp; a $31,000 dining set for Ben Carson's office suite. https://t.co/6w85pOoV1d
#PollutingPruitt’s time at the #EPA has been mired with secrecy, conflicts of interest &amp; a waste of taxpayer $. His unethical actions—&amp; disinterest in our environment—put our health and safety at risk. Today, I cosponsored a new resolution calling for his resignation. #BootPruitt https://t.co/Z7t25F1XKH
As Ranking Dem on the Financial Services Subcommittee, I pushed @MickMulvaneyOMB on "wasteful spending." It's alarming that while he submitted a budget request of $0 for CFBP (&amp; previously advocated for its elimination), he also signed off on large pay raises for senior staff.
1 of OMB’s key responsibilities is production of the President’s budget gov-wide. On that measure, I'm afraid OMB has managed to disappoint me even more than last yr.  Today, I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB about #TrumpBudget, which would create an annual deficit of $984B in its 1st yr.
Urban #flooding frequently occurs outside the regulatory floodplain, and @FEMA maps don't always accurately indicate #flood risk in these areas, resulting in uncertainty of the hazards.  Read about the bill, which will help cities like #Chicago plan ahead: https://t.co/Cv9shNH69D
From property damage &amp; economic challenges to health/safety risks, Americans are often unaware of the dangers they face during floods—This bill helps.

From coast to coast, urban flooding has a unique &amp; powerful ability to wreak havoc in our communities, leaving our constituents feeling helpless in the aftermath.  Today—I was proud to lead bipartisan, bicameral legislation to map urban #flooding &amp; help @FEMA better assess risks.
2 independent watchdog groups released reports detailing abuse &amp; violation of law at the #EPA in pursuit of perks for Administrator Pruitt &amp; his staff. So much for #DrainTheSwamp. RT to tell President Trump to fire #PollutingPruitt now! https://t.co/nwZ0MRnRKT

It is the responsibility of Congress to set the parameters for ongoing operations and determine the appropriate level of deterrence to prevent the further use of chemical weapons. https://t.co/biLhvZiilV
While I share the strong belief that we must hold the Assad regime accountable for its despicable actions, any sustained engagement against the regime requires the passage of a long overdue Authorization for the Use of Military Force. #AUMF
Over the past year, the President has failed to develop a comprehensive strategy, which is only underscored by his refusal to consult Congress on the continued use of military forces in #Syria and his disinterest in a diplomatic effort to permanently end the Syrian civil war.
As I said in April, when the President first ordered U.S. military strikes against the Assad regime, the use of deadly chemical weapons is inhumane, barbaric, and deserves the full condemnation of the United States and the entire international community.

.@SecElaineChao's misinterpretation &amp; misrepresentation of facts have already been used to help kill funding for a major transportation project in NY &amp; NJ and could ultimately jeopardize essential federal $$ for some of #Chicago’s biggest priorities. https://t.co/lZYpfRny5z
This blatant departure from existing policy will have a chilling effect on #infrastructure loan programs nationwide. I'll continue to use my position as only IL member of the Appropriations Committee to press Chao on this issue &amp; ensure that she enforces the law as it’s written. https://t.co/849Ot8JWHU
Under the law, #TIFIA loans, which many #Illinois and #Chicago agencies rely on to help fund crucial projects such as @CTA’s Blue Line improvements and the River Walk, are expressly considered part of the local portion of project funding. https://t.co/5nL88kzBGz
At today’s #THUD #appropriations hearing, @USDOT @SecElaineChao tried to convince me that in most cases, federal loans for #transportation projects that are paid back by local funds don’t count as the local cost share for much-needed #infrastructure projects. She is wrong.
As a leader in the effort to create information help desks at the nation’s most backlogged #immigration courts, I am beyond disappointed that these courts will now halt legal assistance for #immigrants. We must protect their due-process rights. https://t.co/8ZDAPa212s

In our 21st-century world, equal access to online content is the cornerstone of freely moving communication &amp; commerce. Trump &amp; Ajit Pai’s plan to eliminate vital net neutrality safeguards would cause irreparable harm to consumers, stifle innovation &amp; curtail free expression.

Proud to be one of 64 House Democrats to call for the overdue resignation of #PollutingPruitt. From his unethical behavior &amp; wasteful use of taxpayer $$$ to the numerous actions he's taken to violate the @EPA's mission -- it's time for Scott Pruitt to go.  https://t.co/pGzmjYRYvD
President Trump's continued attacks on the #FreePress don't just undermine our #democracy—They are also having adverse effects around the world, where political leaders have seen it as a green light to crack down on open, independent media. https://t.co/8W7jogEXeh
So much for accountability, transparency &amp; sense of duty.   At least 5 officials at EPA, 4 of them high-ranking, were reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs in the past year after they raised concerns about the spending &amp; management of Scott Pruitt. https://t.co/PcrYDVEz9b
Retaliating against your staff for raising ethics concerns is indefensible. What more must @EPAPruitt do to prove that he deserves to be fired? #BootPruitt https://t.co/CwHQwn4epu

@elainehenry2017 @EPAScottPruitt As Vice Chair of @SEEC, I challenged Pruitt several times to a public debate on climate change. I’ve also introduced legislation to protect regional EPA offices from closure and I sent Pruitt reports to educate himself on climate science. Doesn’t look like he’s read them yet.

THREAD: From #election security &amp; counterterrorism to #transportation infrastructure &amp; airport noise control, here are a few of the legislative priorities I was proud to secure funding for in the #omnibus as a House Appropriator: https://t.co/Cj5dkAGCYa
While I’m extremely disappointed that the #omnibus didn't include a #DACA solution or bolder steps to combat #gunviolence, I'm pleased with the work the spending bill did to improve national security, medical research, opioid abuse prevention, transportation, job creation &amp; more.
FY18 #omnibus is far from perfect. By refusing to work w/ us on #DACA, Republicans once again illustrated their unwillingness to protect hardworking #immigrants in search of the American Dream. #Dreamers deserve our support &amp; Dems will continue to push for a vote on their behalf.
Today, #HPSCI Democrats sought to:   •Hold the hearing in open session •Issue a number of subpoenas •Hold Steve Bannon in contempt  Republicans rejected all of it, illustrating their lack of courage during one of the most important times in our history. https://t.co/bo9a66g7Se

Ending the #Russia probe early may serve the Republican Party politically, but it's a dangerous disservice to the American people, who rely on their gov to keep them safe.   Our lack of response &amp; preparation gives Putin the green to attempt future attacks https://t.co/Xypuavw22y

A tenacious trailblazer, an unrelenting advocate, and a true public servant – we will never forget the example set by Louise Slaughter.    My thoughts are with her family, friends, staff &amp; constituents.
She showed me the ropes, and helped me understand the process. When I first arrived to Congress, I’d often feel tired or irritated during 2am votes, but then I’d look over at Louise and see her fighting furiously with such compassion &amp; courage for the issues we care about.
Kind, thoughtful, determined – the first three words that come to mind when I think of Louise Slaughter. https://t.co/uTCn7yMfMH

Exactly 1 month after tragic #ParklandShooting—students from +25 schools in the DC area joined Members of Congress for #NationalWalkoutDay.

No surprise that on the heels of House Republicans’ decision to end our #RussiaInvestigation in order to protect the president, Trump promptly fires Secretary Tillerson because of his acknowledgement of #Russian interference &amp; aggression. https://t.co/720sCNxVBn
The only people who are pleased with this outcome are President Trump, Vladimir Putin, and the House Republicans who took part in this charade. Read my full statement: https://t.co/mhDKJdksbZ https://t.co/Rf090nIpIc
From Nunes’ consistent coordination with the WH to the release of a misleading memo attacking FBI &amp; DOJ, @SpeakerRyan has been complicit in the breakdown of the investigation &amp; growing degradation of our democratic institutions. His lack of leadership &amp; courage is striking.
Rs have done everything they can to defend these witnesses from answering our questions truthfully &amp; have done nothing to corroborate a word they’ve said. With our investigation coming to an early end, we won’t be in a position to respond or hold those witnesses accountable.
There are numerous important topics the #investigation had yet to dive into, including money laundering &amp; how we can best safeguard future elections. At the same time, there are key witnesses, including Erik Prince &amp; Roger Stone, who we know have lied to the committee.
While we've learned a lot over the past year, we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of Russian interference &amp; the role Trump associates played. For Rs to determine that there was no collusion b/w Trump &amp; Russia at this early stage is as disingenuous as it is suspicious.
What a self-fulfilling prophecy.   Republicans have weakened our committee's credibility at every turn through endless distractions &amp; delays. Now, they want to end the investigation BECAUSE of our lack of credibility; their own self-inflicted wound. https://t.co/mRtEzdJI21
"Nothing to see here, folks." - HPSCI Republicans, who just ended our investigation yesterday. https://t.co/l9jTa33WaR
When it comes to this investigation, ignorance is most certainly not bliss.  And yet, less than 8 months before midterms, House Republicans have decided to end our search for answers, our search for truth.  What we don't know will hurt us &amp; they'll only have themselves to blame.
By prematurely abandoning this investigation essential to our safety, security &amp; the strength of our democracy, HPSCI Republicans are abdicating their duties not only as Members of Congress—but as Americans.
1. Service to the president. 2. Service to the country.   House Republicans have solidified their partisan priorities, and the American people will not forget.
Enjoyed taking my #UndercoverCongressman initiative to @Paper_Source on #Southport, where I helped set up a #TeacherAppreciation display, assisted customers &amp; worked the register.

While this action is long overdue, I'm pleased with Mnuchin’s response that this Admin will finally—and fully—sanction Russia over election meddling within the "next several weeks." I will hold Treasury’s feet to the fire to ensure he fulfils this pledge &amp; follows the law. Watch: https://t.co/3HOqbV6vCv
Regardless of how President Trump feels personally about Russian #sanctions, he ultimately signed them into law &amp; is obligated to act. By doing nothing, he's effectively telling the world that there are no consequences for attacking our democratic process. https://t.co/4NSdkKPznI
@expressojf @stevenmnuchin1 #Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade #sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes.
Tune in to my questioning on the #treasury #budget... https://t.co/duqAA9ya0X
Under Terrorism &amp; Financial Intelligence program, only 4 additional employees are budgeted for Russia-related sanctions activities. That compares to 69 additional employees budgeted for #NorthKorea activities. #Treasury must address this discrepancy &amp; lack of urgency immediately.
HAPPENING NOW: I'm asking @stevenmnuchin1 will this Administration fully &amp; finally implement the #Russian sanctions mandated by Congress?
#IRS would suffer a $100M reduction in this #budget. In order to meet this new funding level, the IRS would need to reduce staffing further by 6,000. It’s hard to imagine why this Admin would want to weaken the IRS &amp; give taxpayers less resources, right after passing a tax bill.
.@USTreasury is charged with protecting our financial system from the illicit &amp; criminal activities, as well as carrying out sanctions used to deter hostile action from foreign actors. But yet again this year, the #Treasury budget would slash programs that keep us safe.

Repealing the ACA, slashing hundreds of billions from nutritional assistance programs, and reducing the EPA's budget by a third will do nothing to make America great, but it will go a long way in weakening our competitiveness in the global economy. #TrumpBudget

#TrumpBudget is as ludicrous as it is disturbing. With at least a half trillion in proposed cuts to #Medicare &amp; $250 billion stolen from #Medicaid, President Trump has yet again turned his back on hardworking Americans &amp; his dishonest pledge to preserve entitlement programs.
Asking cities &amp; states to foot the bill for our disintegrating #infrastructure—all while the federal gov stands by the wayside &amp; allows private companies to generate a profit off of existing taxpayer-funded programs—is careless, callous, and counterproductive. #InfrastructurePlan https://t.co/ZEPO9R96FR
Anyone who understands US #infrastructure needs will tell you the biggest barrier to fixing our crumbling #transportation systems is a lack of adequate funding.

The President immediately—and without scrutiny—approves the release of a memo that he claims "vindicates" him.   When it comes to a memo that bolsters the credibility of our investigation and the intelligence community... well then, things are a little bit different. Shocking.
The American people deserve the full picture to understand exactly what took place. We look forward to consulting with the FBI &amp; DOJ to address concerns and make that possible.
The Democratic memo relies on facts to set the record straight following the flawed #NunesMemo. Unfortunately, it is no surprise that President Trump wants to subvert the truth in order to continue to propagate misleading, partisan spin. https://t.co/5JjwVxTw8S

It is clear that the GOP is willing to risk a constitutional crisis in order to protect this president–even at the expense of protecting the American people. The public has a right to know the extent to which the WH had a role in the creation of this memo. https://t.co/rO1V0ADa2E
This biased, incomplete &amp; in many instances completely false document may provide Nunes &amp; his allies with what they perceive as a short-term political win, but it will come at the great expense of our national security &amp; will break critical trust b/w HPSCI &amp; the Intel Community.
By breaking the mutual understanding between the DOJ, FBI &amp; House Intelligence Committee, Pres. Trump, Speaker Ryan &amp; House Rs have all become complicit in the degradation of our democratic institutions &amp; the undermining of key national security relationships that keep us safe.

No mention of gun violence prevention. No mention of the sexual assault epidemic. No mention of Russia. #SOTU
During Monday’s Intelligence Committee meeting, I asked Rep. Nunes if his staffers had been talking with the White House as they compiled their memo on the FBI &amp; Justice Department. The response: https://t.co/XdtZ9sxyDj
My final thought before I head into #SOTU: one scripted speech will do nothing to reverse the irreparable harm done to hardworking Americans or disguise the demeaning rhetoric used by the President to attack immigrants, communities of color, the press, &amp; countless others.
From failing to put forward a jobs bill &amp; exploding the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthy; to alienating allies &amp; refusing to hold #Russia accountable – our national economy &amp; our national security have been put at risk. #SOTU https://t.co/7e0AdEVXQP

Since Republicans took the majority 7 years ao, they have been unable to enact a single bill to fund the government without Democratic votes. If they can’t pass a CR on their own, they must negotiate with Democrats in good faith to address these key issues &amp; avoid a #shutdown.
President Trump's failure on #DACA is a self-inflicted wound. Republicans control the House, Senate &amp; White House. This would be the 1st time in American history that a party holding all three would chose to shut down a government entirely under its own control.
I won't vote for a CR that abandons #DREAMers who are contributing to communities across the US, including in Chicago. I don’t want a #shutdown, but if we get there, my opposition to a CR that fails to address key long-term issues, incl #DACA protections, won't be the reason why.
THREAD: A #shutdown is not a political football to score partisan points – it's a destabilizing &amp; dangerous outcome with real world impacts for Americans across the country.
TUNE IN: I'll be on @CNN at approx. 1:25pm EST to talk with @wolfblitzer about the looming #shutdown threat, the latest in our ongoing #Russia investigation &amp; continued provocation by #NorthKorea.
#Illinois has the nation’s 4th largest number of #DACA recipients, with more than 35,600 beneficiaries living in the state as of September. We need to pass a #DreamActNow so Dreamers in #IL aren't left scrambling to renew their status! https://t.co/3wK6JlCisl
This week, House Republicans &amp; Democrats pushed back against Sec. Tillerson's misguided decision to close the @StateDept Cyber office. If we've learned anything last year, it's that we have to do everything possible to bolster our #CyberSecurity defenses. https://t.co/vxSMDAw85z
The prevalence &amp; severity of Russian meddling cannot be understated. We must safeguard our #elections, which will require coordination between all levels of government &amp; leaders in the #tech industry. https://t.co/PdwvZGENLT
As a Member of @AppropsDems, I’ll continue to push for funding to address the massive @NatlParkService maintenance backlog. We must also continue to exercise congressional oversight to ensure that @Interior fulfills its obligation to keep #NationalParks open &amp; accessible. https://t.co/ipXnGyQ3S3
Over 75% of the #NationalParkService advisory panel just resigned claiming, "We were frozen out."  We can't trust @SecretaryZinke to protect our #NationalParks when he refuses to meet with the advisory board. He didn't convene a single mtg w/ them in 2017. https://t.co/TAI7PL00dp
The #FCC ignored the public's strong support for #NetNeutrality, but now #Illinois state government is considering legislation to preserve Obama-era rules. To spur innovation, education &amp; economic competitiveness, we must provide a free &amp; open #internet. https://t.co/5LaN6pCbO9
It's hunting season at @Interior... "Under @SecretaryZinke, the only question, from the redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, is how fast these resources can be auctioned off."   We should all be outraged by the damage being done to our #publiclands: https://t.co/PZXwSbEjIE
New, sobering data illustrates the direct impact of Trump's shameful &amp; relentless #ACA sabotage. It is the first time since the historic law’s main features took effect – the first time in a decade – that the number of #uninsured Americans has increased. https://t.co/Vb9kHhFTPv
MUST READ: This week, I'm continuing to push Rs to reauthorize #CHIP &amp; provide #healthcare for millions of vulnerable kids. As my colleague @RepJoeKennedy makes clear, 90% of these children live in households with family incomes that fall under 200% of the federal poverty line. https://t.co/ycpoptuJKw
Good news for #IL voters, but with state elections less than 2 months away, more work remains to increase election integrity. https://t.co/CIze2ke05D
Absolutely heartbreaking. Jorge came to the U.S. when he was just ten years old. After living in America for 3 decades, he was deported to Mexico, which tears him away from his family, the community he contributes to, and the only home he's ever known. https://t.co/Ln6crrEuKO
ICYMI: I spoke with @KasieDC about why Steve Bannon is of great interest to our ongoing #Russia investigation. Given his roles during the campaign and in the Administration, he had a ringside seat to what took place. Watch here: https://t.co/CrzTpMxOxl
#MLKDay has passed but it's not too late for #IL05 residents to visit the new @ChicagoMuseum exhibit, "Remembering Dr. King: 1929-1968," which features more than 25 photographs with a special focus on his time in #Chicago. https://t.co/4tvl8rAIh6
Pleased to attend the Southport Neighbors Association to hear from #IL05 constituents &amp; tell them about my legislative priorities, including #infrastructure, combatting #climatechange &amp; strengthening our election systems to protect against future Russian hacks. https://t.co/T6MsSACJuS
A special start to #MLKDay: visiting the brand new @ChicagoMuseum exhibit, "Remebering Dr. King: 1929-1968." Great to see photos illustrating his leadership in the Civil Rights movement &amp; commitment to nonviolence, which cemented his place as a hero for peace &amp; justice worldwide. https://t.co/9wGU5Dn1TM
I’ve always believed that it is our moral obligation to ensure justice for all by celebrating our nation’s diversity. We must reject ALL political discourse that pits our differences against each other in a way that undermines our values &amp; our strength. #MLKDay
Today, as we reflect upon the transformative progress made by #DrKing, we must also recognize the injustice that remains a formidable force in the United States – in our schools, housing, employment, and beyond. #MLKDay

I applaud @LarryHogan for putting our shared #environment before anti-science, partisan politics by adding #Maryland to the list of 14 other states + Puerto Rico who have commitment to the #ParisAgreement. It is time for @GovRauner to do the same. https://t.co/m5gLCXYQl3 https://t.co/pu1wqGXucZ
#ThrowbackThursday: Last year, I led my #IL Democratic colleagues in urging @GovRauner to commit #Illinois to the #ParisAgreement. With Trump ceding U.S. leadership on #ClimateChange, it's the cities &amp; states who have to step up. Read the letter: https://t.co/KkpUqhxxl4
FACT CHECK: 8 in 10 #Medicaid enrollees are in families with at least one worker or work themselves. That figure is no different in #IL, where we have over 3.2M people who rely on Medicaid for #healthcare. Learn more via @KaiserFamFound: https://t.co/uiwYrOsxPh https://t.co/S1O3day2bS
Prioritizing political points over productive policymaking hurts people, especially the most vulnerable. Work requirements for #Medicaid will only perpetuate myths that hurt low-income Americans. https://t.co/8xhq4igYJ1

I thanked #Chicago #Dreamers for their unending contributions to our communities. It's time to support these individuals like they've supported us by putting yesterday’s discussion into practice &amp; quickly reaching a legislative agreement. #DefendDACA https://t.co/u4MTTnPf7Z https://t.co/9ZTVqQiaTW
Trump's peculiar roundtable was positive—in the sense that bipartisan intentions were voiced— but we need more than photo ops. We need actual action to iron out key details ASAP. That is why I met with more #Chicago #Dreamers today. https://t.co/u4MTTnPf7Z https://t.co/09gZ4VbT68
From issuing direct threats to end #DACA to inaccurately accusing Democrats of abandoning #DREAMERs, our president has given these young people no reason to rest assured that they will be able to remain in the only home they’ve ever known. #DefendDACA https://t.co/u4MTTnPf7Z
President Trump’s rhetoric on #DACA is consistently inconsistent. Yesterday, he promised to sign a DACA bill, and yet today—less than 24 hours later—he is criticizing the court system for upholding DACA protections. https://t.co/b7Js8emrP0
"#Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election fits into a nearly two-decade pattern of meddling with governments around the world."  Time to acknowledge &amp; act, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/baM3yB1w3p

Begin your week by reading the  story of my friend &amp; former colleague, @GabbyGiffords, &amp; the work she has done to combat #GunViolence since being shot 7 years ago today. We should all mirror her courage &amp; initiative as we work to help save lives. https://t.co/DX8gjVQ2pL
Another vindictive &amp; heartless act—or rather, inaction—by President Trump. Nearly 200K Salvadoran #immigrants came to America under #TPS to escape persecution &amp; violence. Now, they may be forced to leave. https://t.co/0qT46J3mRj
I don't know what's worse: lies or delusions. Even after recent indictments of high-level Trump associates, the president continues to assert there was no collusion with Russia. It would be laughable if this wasn't so perilous. https://t.co/9nqBqFMdPs
What concerns me is the unwillingness of the President's own party to talk about concerns re: his fitness to serve—unless that is, they're on the way out the door. All Members— not just those retiring—need to step up &amp; speak out about the implications of Trump's words &amp; actions. https://t.co/W8Pz64RIHn

When for-profit colleges defraud loan borrowers, it shouldn't be the #students who are punished. Rule change by @BetsyDeVosED would make it more difficult for students, who were mislead about the value and cost of their degrees, to get relief. Why? https://t.co/XQR7lWTk7f

Make no mistake: this is another attempt by Trump to undermine the 2020 #census while targeting #immigrants &amp; #votingrights. With census data used to determine federal funding &amp; #redistricting, this is an attack against our democracy. https://t.co/m0OFb3lV20

@SpeakerRyan Republicans need to go back to the drawing board &amp; work w/ Dems to pass an economic plan that addresses our real economic challenges by fostering growth, creating jobs, and delivering new opportunities. Read my full statement on passage of the #GOPTaxScam: https://t.co/OcwQaQm8uo
@SpeakerRyan I’ve heard from my constituents, who overwhelmingly—almost unanimously—oppose this #GOPTaxScam, just like the majority of Americans across the US. I promise them that I will hold Republicans’ feet to the fire and continue to urge them to abandon their anti-middle class agenda.
Now that we’re one step closer to adding $1.5 trillion in unpaid tax cuts to our growing deficits, @SpeakerRyan has made clear his intention of slashing #Medicare, #Medicaid, and anti-poverty programs to address the debt crisis manufactured by this #GOPTaxScam.
But if you're part of 1 of the 86M families who will see their taxes rise in next decade or 1 of the 13M Americans that will lose healthcare b/c of the individual mandate repeal—then this vote will be remembered as another giveaway to the wealthy on the backs of the middle-class. https://t.co/65t0ptcyRm
Today, Republicans shamefully forced the #GOPTaxScam through Congress &amp; onto the President's desk. This is great news if you're 1) in the top 1% of earners, who will receive 83% of the tax cuts 2) a tax lawyer hired to exploit new loopholes 3) a member of Trump’s inner circle.
President Trump told Republicans not to talk about the #GOPTaxScam's repeal of the #ACA #IndividualMandate so that people wouldn’t know it was in there. Here's why: https://t.co/OFqCMOwuob
FACT: The #ACA has not been repealed.  FACT: The repeal of the #ACA #IndividualMandate will have devastating public health consequences. FACT: President Trump doesn't care about facts. https://t.co/H7RwxtWdPP

As Republicans speed towards passing their #GOPTaxScam, the American people are increasingly against it. We all agree there are bipartisan fixes to make our tax system better, but #TaxCuts for the top 1% won't help. https://t.co/u5rpZZ1nmm
Trump has long promised to upgrade our roads, bridges and other public works, but meaningful #infrastructure improvements have taken a back seat to partisan priorities that harm the middle class. https://t.co/Ek1BOiPMJY
Did you know: the #GOPTaxScam's catastrophic decision to undermine the Low Income #Housing Tax Credit would lead to a loss of nearly 1 million #AffordableHousing units over the next decade. https://t.co/ny8lEaXVRA
It's impossible to deny the impacts of #ClimateChange when you see a magnificent wild animal desperately scrounge for food in a trash can. We are better than this. We must fight to protect our #wildlife &amp; #environment. https://t.co/uqArf1p9fl
.@tim_cook &amp; Charles Koch agree: "For about 690,000 of our neighbors, colleagues and friends, this holiday season is marked by uncertainty and fear."   Congress must #DefendDACA. https://t.co/Sj71DnYznG
By abandoning relief for #students who were victims of fraud by predatory for-profit colleges, Sec. DeVos is placing them in financial limbo. This is outrageous. https://t.co/G4fVMZc38z
"Watchdog report finds moldy food, mistreatment in #immigrant detention centers" via @washingtonpost. https://t.co/s27zCGR9lF  This horrific, inhumane treatment of detained immigrants cannot be met with repeated ICE budget increases.
@PaceSuburbanBus Thanks to new flex lanes, which are available to busses &amp; emergency vehicles, passengers are able to avoid traffic on the highway. @PaceSuburbanBus #IL05 #MikeOnTheMove #Transportation https://t.co/zGyqsQVwD2
I'm proud of cities like #Chicago that ensure #publictransit is accessible to all members of the community. Great to see how @PaceSuburbanBus has taken advantage of recent road rebuilding &amp; widening to connect commuters to their destination. #MikeOnTheMove https://t.co/OStIdbHVdJ
I'm pleased #Illinois has taken key steps to implement initial security enhancements, but too many other states haven't done enough to update systems, establish contingency plans or provide clear guidance for officials in case of another hack—We need resources, funding, personnel https://t.co/bh24skgPqz
Did you know: an estimated 42 states use outdated #voting machines susceptible to cyberintrusions &amp; system crashes and 13 states continue to use voting machines that fail to produce a paper ballot or record. These are not equipped to handle modern-day #cybersecurity software. https://t.co/cCbYrHdJsO
There is no doubt in my mind that the #Russians will be back in future attempts to undermine our democracy &amp; influence our elections. In order to safeguard our democratic process, we must invest in election infrastructure updates that are long overdue. https://t.co/QeUHax5OQN
STARTING SHORTLY: Visit https://t.co/VltUmDDG0P at 10am CT. In the wake of #Russian hacking, I'm hosting a press conference with #Illinois election officials on the vulnerabilities that still exist in our #election systems &amp; the work we must do to harden our defenses.

There are 255K children in #IL counting on Congress to get it's act together &amp; reauthorize #CHIP. We simply cannot prioritize #TaxCuts over kids &amp; their #healthcare. https://t.co/fKRlKAQbKJ
#Transparency organizations across the political spectrum support my common-sense bill to create a central, user-friendly &amp; 21st-century data system to house vital Congressional reports: https://t.co/qGYkXvD9aD
I believe the American people should have easy access to the same reports that Congress reads. My bipartisan bill would increase #transparency &amp; provide the public with more information about the policies that impact their lives. Read more: https://t.co/yujnhnTg0n

It's hard to believe it's been 5 years since a gunman entered #SandyHook Elementary &amp; robbed the world of innocent children &amp; passionate educators. As we remember the beautiful souls we lost, we must also ask ourselves: what have we done to prevent this from ever happening again? https://t.co/Bogo2BEo1g
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC The #FCC’s proposed plan would reduce competition, stifle innovation &amp; charge customers more for less; and the vote must not move forward. Read our letter urging a delay on the vote to repeal #NetNeutality: https://t.co/M5TxwncK8T
@FCC #FCC vote to repeal #NetNeutrality would harm free speech, stall entrepreneurship &amp; deal a major blow to economic competitiveness. Equal access to all online content is a cornerstone of the Internet &amp; @AjitPaiFCC's order would weaken vital protections. https://t.co/W0OFwIUENk
Today, @FCC is scheduled to vote on the “Restoring #Internet Freedom" order to repeal #NetNeutrality.   I sent a letter to #FCC Commissioners strongly urging them not to vote on this order, which would have disastrous consequences for American consumers. https://t.co/M5TxwncK8T
Yet another casualty of the #GOPTaxScam: Major job losses in the renewable #energy sector. The Republicans are putting American #jobs &amp; the future of #CleanEnergy production in jeopardy. Read via @UCSUSA: https://t.co/qUCrPYYHMo

There is absolutely no reason to restrict @CDCgov from studying the #gunviolence epidemic. That's why I joined 120 of my Dem colleagues to call on House leadership to lift research restrictions. Read the full letter here: https://t.co/7KRLm1I56H
Conducting #GunViolence #research is an obvious first step to equip us with a deeper understanding of the policies we can enact to save lives. Proud to join my Dem colleagues in urging Republicans to break w/ the status quo, encourage scientific research, and elevate the debate. https://t.co/BWJd9htVCo
Today, I sent a letter to GOP leadership urging them to oppose language in the final FY18 #appropriations package that would restrict @CDCgov &amp; other agencies from conducting #research about #GunViolence. #HonorWithAction https://t.co/7KRLm1I56H
The American people want more than thoughts &amp; prayers. With over 170,000 gun deaths since 2012, we must pass strong, commonsense #gun safety standards that #OutShoutTheGunLobby and #HonorWithAction. https://t.co/j3MoJnZBFf
Last night's election results illustrate a firm rejection of discriminatory attacks on #VotingRights! But we can still do more to protect against future acts of #VoterSuppression that undermine constitutional rights by enacting laws like #VRAA &amp; Automatic #Voter Registration Act.
I #StandWithStudents. These Obama-era rules were put in place to protect individuals from predatory for-profit colleges &amp;  then repay the loans of those who earned worthless degrees. This war on #students is a giveaway to scam universities. https://t.co/2utsQpuEwI
American scientists shouldn't have to rely on foreign nations to fund their #research. We need to be encouraging #climate scientists here at home—not driving them away. Our future &amp; #environment depend on it. https://t.co/6LunTK38Cp

Wishing all who celebrate #Hanukkah a very joyous festival of lights spent with loved ones.

"That's not what Trump promised."  We could invest in our communities, schools &amp; families. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam goes against everything the President promised on the campaign trail by disproportionately benefiting the wealthy &amp; big corporations. https://t.co/uIBKJo3mZH
Our #economy is strengthened by the #innovation &amp; job creation that stems from #entrepreneurs -- including #DREAMers. They shouldn't be stuck in limbo as Congress runs out the clock. We must #DefendDACA. https://t.co/sr18vDyX9p
#GOPTaxScam according to @USATODAY: "shows how Republicans aren’t allowed to act in their own best interests, let alone the nation’s. That is because they are captive to a militant faction within the GOP, a coalition of the very rich and the very angry." https://t.co/Rwun15Vtmv
Since being signed into law, Republicans have worked tirelessly to sabotage the #ACA. With #OpenEnrollment ending this week, we must fight back against GOP efforts to turn the life-saving bill into destructive #TrumpCare. https://t.co/37puIlQ9B4
"If my Republican colleagues don’t want to know what happened, at least get out of the way &amp; let us find out so the American public can find out what took place, and how our democratic process was challenged."

As Americans learn more about the #GOPTaxScam, they're increasingly opposed. It would raise taxes on the middle class and raise the deficit by $1.3 trillion. Here's the latest count on what I'm hearing from my #IL05 constituents:  Oppose: 2,180 Support: 0 https://t.co/BEsh23Da5Z

States are now sending out notices to warn parents that #CHIP funds are drying up. Congress' failure to do its job is costing millions of children their #healthcare. https://t.co/xpkQaD5yVV
Instead of working to expand universal background checks or crack down on firearm trafficking, Republicans have decided to undermine states with strong, common-sense #gun laws that protect &amp; promote #publicsafety. Read my statement: https://t.co/YDv152JfoL
Legislation like the the #ConcealedCarryReciprocityAct is beyond tone-deaf; it is dangerous &amp; deplorable. In wake of the numerous tragedies we have faced recently as a result of #GunViolence, we should be strengthening our gun laws—not weakening them. https://t.co/aWGTvNPDDB
This year has seen a disgraceful retreat of US global leadership on #ClimateChange. It's now up to states &amp; cities to take the reins. The #ChicagoClimateCharter was a major step forward &amp; I'm proud to see #Chicago step up to the challenge. https://t.co/M8r6sIcURN
By repealing a centerpiece of the #ACA, the #GOPTaxScam would cause health insurance premiums to skyrocket. Why do Republicans want to raise #HealthCare costs just so corporations can get a #TaxCut? https://t.co/M39GzHPWzi
#TheSilenceBreakers showed profound courage by speaking truth to power &amp; initiating this momentous, overdue conversation. #MeToo gives a voice to millions of women who have faced pervasive harassment &amp; abuse. #PersonOfTheYear reinforces the cultural change that must take place. https://t.co/E1mZJF5xA7

Pleased to see that my Republican colleagues are beginning to realize how important it is to #ProtectDACA. But we need more than words -- we need action to ensure #DACA recipients can stay in the only home they've ever known. https://t.co/4gwh0dbODU
I recently intro'd legislation that would require @TheJusticeDept to study the link between #DomesticViolence &amp; #GunViolence. If #HR38 were to become law, victims of domestic violence would face a greater risk from abusers. https://t.co/rsRCD4E2cO
Did you know: #HR38 would open the flood gates for people to skirt #ConcealedCarry laws? People in #IL shouldn’t be put in danger because of other states' loose gun laws. Read more via @Suntimes: https://t.co/cxojOsHP9n

I call on concerned Americans everywhere to stand with our #NationalMonuments &amp; #NationalParks against Trump’s shameful efforts to unnecessarily dismantle our natural heritage. My full statement on #BearsEars &amp; #GrandStaircase here: https://t.co/ThMr69muVz
By attempting to shrink our awe-inspiring #monuments by as much as 85%, the Trump Administration is declaring open season on America’s #publiclands. https://t.co/ddh73IYJv8 #BearsEars #GrandStaircase
Trump's decision to shrink #BearsEars &amp; #GrandStaircase is clearest example yet that this Admin is unwavering in its desire to hand over our precious natural places to extractive fossil fuel companies aiming to cash-in at the expense of our #environment. https://t.co/ThMr69E6k9
Last week, in the dead of night, Senate Republicans passed a tax bill rooted in hypocrisy &amp; fiscal irresponsibility. Here is your weekly update on what #IL05 residents think of the #GOPTaxScam:   Oppose: 1,835 Support: 0 https://t.co/zVP1c42uhE

Because of the topography of our city &amp; the impacts of changing weather in our region, #Chicago residents &amp; businesses are uniquely vulnerable to the costly &amp; devastating effects of urban flooding. McCook Reservoir will help. https://t.co/CcmNYEMxNo

#Consumers deserve commonsense protections from falling into payday debt traps. Shortsighted House bill introduced today to repeal the @CFPB’s payday lending rule places predatory lenders above working-class families.
72 days ago, #HurricaneMaria tore through #PuertoRico. Today:  34% of power hasn't been restored 27% of cell sites are still down 982 survivors remain in 41 shelters across the island  Our federal government must step up &amp; help these American citizens. https://t.co/m4IWw2wK0a
Today's development only underscores the need to go full throttle with our investigations. Who else in Trump's inner-circle communicated with our foreign adversaries in Russia? What was discussed or promised?
Every American—regardless of political affiliation—should be outraged by Russia’s hacking of our democratic process, as well as by any attempts this White House makes to undermine our ongoing investigations.
Michael Flynn “willfully &amp; knowingly” made “false, fictitious &amp; fraudulent statements” to the FBI regarding communication with #Russia. This is the same man that President Trump appointed as a senior official in charge of our national security. https://t.co/xGlLNWlaT3

If Republicans won't listen to the families, students, teachers &amp; homeowners who will be hurt by the #GOPTaxScam, maybe they'll listen to @AARP &amp; the 5.2 million #seniors whose taxes would increase. Not holding my breath. https://t.co/pAZGUhn8Av
The American people are justifiably fed up with the government’s failure to instill practical &amp; overdue #transparency measures that increase public access &amp; restore public trust. Read how my #TGA bill shines a light on gov operations &amp; policymakers: https://t.co/ZQwVcsfiaZ https://t.co/pBXkSUiWHx
I’ve introduced #TGA every session since I was elected, but I believe it is needed now more than ever. This year, we’ve seen federal agencies scrub information from their official websites &amp; federal appointees fail to disclose potential conflicts of interest.
Today, I reintroduced the #Transparency in Government Act for the 5th time. #TGA strengthens oversight of federal spending, expands financial disclosure requirements &amp; modernizes how the public accesses information. Common-sense steps to increase accountability.
The #GOPTaxScam directly impacts #teachers &amp; grad #students. Republicans' continued assault on higher #education will deter students from pursuing their ambitions, which strengthen our nation's competitiveness. https://t.co/Ksj6ceb1Ru
The main argument Republicans relied on in support of their #GOPTaxScam was just undercut by the very corporations the #TaxCuts will benefit. Workers, families, &amp; small businesses are being thrown under the bus so shareholders can reap the benefits. https://t.co/g26GkX1xf1
It is up to all of us—men, women, entertainers, journalists, Members of Congress, and the President of the United States—to spread awareness, increase transparency, and make the structural changes needed to end this cycle. https://t.co/egiXVIqgpV
All of those walking the halls of Congress should feel safe &amp; protected from the horrors of these inappropriate &amp; despicable actions. This must begin with a zero tolerance policy and an internal look at the roles we all play. https://t.co/hJSmRbTyvd
Pleased the House will now require all members &amp; staff to undergo mandatory sexual harassment training. A practical &amp; needed step forward, but only the very beginning. Read my full statement: https://t.co/C9gXecslfR
As Ranking Member of FSGG Subcommittee, I questioned @SBAgov &amp; @USGSA today on status of #hurricane disaster relief efforts.

Without ever visiting the beautiful #BearsEars &amp; #GrandStaircase monuments, Trump will move to shrink their size—something no president has done to #nationalmonuments in +50 years. Our #publiclands must be protected &amp; celebrated. https://t.co/PgYYR9lFn8
Trump's anti-Muslim tweets today only reinforce his discriminatory #MuslimBan &amp; hatred towards #Immigrants &amp; #DREAMers who make our country better. Now more than ever, we need to stand united against bigotry—not elevate its platform via the Office of the President.

Iran’s regime is not to be trusted, but #JCPOA is working. The President’s decision to not certify #Iran’s compliance is dangerous.

The Trump Administration's attacks on the Intel community greatly disrespect all the hard work they do to keep us safe. #TodaysThreats
Instability created by #ClimateChange increases economic vulnerability, chaos &amp; relates directly to our national security. #TodaysThreats
Anti-Muslim rhetoric &amp; un-American actions like #MuslimBan serve as recruiting tools for extremist orgs, like ISIS. #TodaysThreats
If President won't even acknowledge existence of Russian hacking, it makes it even harder for Congressional action to occur #TodaysThreats
President can send important message to our adversaries by saying Russia hacked into our electoral process—There is no doubt. #TodaysThreats
Having positive, productive relationships with other countries is one of the best ways to ensure our safety here at home. #TodaysThreats
We'll get much more cooperation from our allies to address #TodaysThreats if we work together as opposed to strict #AmericaFirst mentality.

Wish Trump would’ve led &amp;united us on Sat. by calling out white supremacists &amp;neo-Nazis who led attack—Hope he keeps promise to stop bigotry

I'll do everything in my power–thru appropriations process &amp; otherwise–to protect care from misguided, selfish action just taken #TrumpCare
GOP just put politics before people. American public has every right to be outraged. Read my #TrumpCare statement: https://t.co/E4vzP3SQuA
#TrumpCare = ↑ in premiums, deductibles, waiting periods for those with pre-existing conditions. Today's vote is nothing short of selfish.

#ThrowbackThursday https://t.co/dLovpz2cWb
