Two hours ago, I had more career World Cup goals than Ronaldo, clearly making me the better player.  Then he scored a hat trick 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Just woke up to the news that the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America!!!!!!!!  Congrats to everyone who put in the tireless work to make it happen.  How are we supposed to wait 8 more years?!?!? 🇺🇸🇨🇦🇲🇽⚽️⚽️⚽️ @united2026 #UnitedAsOne
I know this isn’t popular but I do find myself rooting for Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama during the World Cup this summer.  In the big picture, CONCACAF teams doing well benefits all of us.  RIP my comments 🤦🏻‍♂️
1. Salah deserved better 2. The foul by Ramos on Salah was not dirty. It was just really unfortunate that it caused that type of injury 3. Bale’s goal was so much more difficult than many will ever realize 4. Please remember that Karius is a human being first.  Have compassion
Yes sir 🙌🏼⚽️ https://t.co/uBJOTdsw5f

I didn’t score in my first 10 games for SJ Earthquakes. My coach, Frank Yallop, stuck with me and knew it would take me time to learn but believed in playing a young kid with potential. We need more coaches/organizations willing to take that chance on young players. https://t.co/fu0AfmJvhJ

Klinsmann moved #USMNT from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 and asked Jones/Bradley to stay central in the midfield and organize. Has worked very well so far
The #USMNT were tactically excellent tonight.  Got early goal, defended well and waited to counterattack. Great response! @ussoccer #USA
Looking forward to seeing a more assertive &amp; aggressive #USMNT tonight. Our team always responds well. #USAvCRC @ussoccer @AmericanOutlaws
Ugly opening game from #USMNT tonight.  Still two games to get it right and advance.  Need a much better performance against Costa Rica.

Lots of upset @ussoccer fans today and understandably so.  Remember, it's just one bad result and we will win the next 3 games and qualify
