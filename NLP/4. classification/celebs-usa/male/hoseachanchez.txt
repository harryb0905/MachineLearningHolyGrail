When we REALIZE our potential is limitless, ONLY then will we see our REAL potential. Doubt is potentials killer, imagination is its POWER!
On the other side of FEAR awaits FREEDOM!
Sometimes your lesson is LET GO. not to fix, not to control, not to want, not to help, not to desire, not to love, not to care, to LET GO!
As you grow closer to destiny it gets harder before it gets easier. Never give up on the dream, no matter how difficult it seems. Keep going

This is the biggest moment of my life! The reason I am an ACTOR! WOW!! http://t.co/r8fc3y9x
One of the biggest moments of my life! THE reason I am an actor! http://t.co/ad2CTkAl
Purpose; the reason something exists or is done, made, an intended or desired result; aim; goal. determination; resoluteness.
Had a EPIC talk with a actor I've looked up to forever. It's important to dream and have people who inspire your life no matter what you do.
You have to be focus, determined and unapologetic about your purpose. When you find it, let no one interfere with what GOD got for you!
Stupidity is a disease. It will infect your abilities, judgement and potential. It is highly contagiouse. Beware of stupidity in your life
Do the tweets of the people you follow represent your views? EMBRACE positivity and peace. withstand ignorance, immaturity and negativity!
Its never to late to cut bullshyt out of our lives. Negativity will leave you empty, lifeless and starved for substance. Start cutting NOW.
We always have a choice. To do better. See better. Feel more. Love more. Forgive more. The more we do, the better we are.
You realize you have no competition in life when you don't play games. If you don't play, they can't compete. YOU are your ONLY compitition!
Goodnight twit Fam! Remeber "humility will get you EVERYWHERE your ego won't, which is MOST places"! The humble shall inherit!  #GODGOTYOU!

Lesson learned: When your first mind tells you it's not good enough, it's probably not good enough.
You are what you think, Not what you think you are!?
Optimism- hopefulness and confidence about the future or successful outcome of something.
Pessimism- state of mind which operates negatively. Seeing what's missing vs whats there.
You reap what you sew. Put out something great, you get something great back. #itsthatsimple

GOD makes us accountable for our Dreams And goals. I'm holding him accountable for his promises and word over my destiny.
Nothing worse than a man with no boundaries. Morals. faith. Substance or accountability. Changing us changes the world fellas.
Being in line with your destiny=priceless!
Make sure you find personal happiness in your job. When it stops being fun its time to move on. GOD will guide you, he always keeps his word
Be who you say you are. Make no mistakes about the impact you leave on this earth. Yeah, it's that important.
Hahah. I Love your true colors. They look best on your skin tone.
GOD won't bless us into misery, pain or confusion. If a double edge knifes in ur life, his plan is for u to prevail sharper than u went in.
Countin blessing, Not short commins!
Ap‚Ä¢pre‚Ä¢ci‚Ä¢a‚Ä¢tion: gratitude, thankfulness, act of estimating qualities and giving them proper value! Ps, Never forget who got u where u are!

I'm over people acting like a COPs life is more important than us regular folk. A life is a life, jobs don't matter in death. It still hurts
This Troy thing is effecting my day. If the cops family's hurt over HIS killing, why would they want ANOTHER family to feel that same way!?
RT @VolMama83 @hoseachanchez @WhoisTPoole 'Eye for an eye'. - The Bible "revenge is mine"- GOD and The Bible
@dbfan2007 @whoistpoole prisons  a shelter that houses lives for punishment. NO ONE, despite actions deserves death, so imprisonments best!
@dbfan2007 like, pot holes, parades, Casey Anthony security, etc.
@dbfan2007 my point is this. Who cares if our tax dollars allow us to fund prisons. We fund some of the stupidest things outside of shelter.
@dbfan2007 @WhoisTPoole why should tax money go to anything? That's a lame statement, I rather feed and shelter a life then fix a pot hole!
@ummm_renee hu? Lol
@ronirose310 yes I would. My beliefs as a man don't wave because of my family.
The DEATH penalty, is the most hypocritical  form of punishment EVER. If killing is illegal why is it legal for the  "system" to kill you?
@GURU_OF_ABS got me barely walking today but you know what they say "no pain no gain". It Takes pain to get In the BEST shape of ur life!!!

Embrace your life, all of it. How u feel about Where u are is a reflection of where ur going. Change your perspective to change your reality
Educate. Inspire. Empower. Evolve. Repeat.
Why Hold on to stupidity, cut the cord. Why Hold on to something that ain't holdin on to you, dumb. This game is lame!
What to make of unanswered questions. With only words to validate the reality that's not real, yet. This shyt is stupid!
Politics. I get it. The evolution of dreams, ones art become commercial due to un-creative un-challenged un-chancing people.

2011, EVERY year after is about EXCELLENCE and ELEVATION in our EXISTENCE! The BEST that life has to offer when DREAMS become REALITY!
The ones who read, learn, study, cultivate always seem to be ahead of the pack. the superficial ones lack substance, knowledge, awareness!
if you just read something simple as a tweet. It can show you the mental capacity of the individual typing it. Paying attention=priceless

one thing I'm not good with is betrayal on any level. I'm loyal. Period. I'm a friend to my friends friends. enemy of my loved ones enemies
Makin a hard decision is liberating for some. Not me. The older I get the more I care about other peoples existence. And purpose.
Lifes a memory in moments. Moment by moment. Shifted, kinda like a gear. Never one mode. Always changing. Always evolven. Always growin.
In the words of my granddad: DO RIGHT AND RIGHT WILL FOLLOW YOU! Words by the wisest man I've ever encountered.
It feels like I've lived a few lives. I think this is the best one yet tho. Can you relate?

It's not that people don't want to forgive you. They do! Sometimes it's hard to erase what you did.
I wonder If there's ever been a man as dope as my grandfather. Hands down HES the Best man I've EVER met!!
Off the BOX now! Lol. All love y'all..
This isn't about me. It's about OUR legacy in the arts. Its about me being a fan of others also. It's bigger than me. #thinkaboutit
I respect the mainstream business mold because every time I look up I'm like. Who is SHE, who is HE, where did they come from? #thinkaboutit
That's why you ALWAYS see a NEW Caucasian actor/actress. They understand to keep there business flourishing they have to breed new TALENT!
Here's the difference. OTHER communities understand the value of NEW talent. They LIVE & BREATH to cultivate there industry for LEGACY sake!
RT @NikkeNik @hoseachanchez are you going to feel that way about YOURSELF 10 years from now?  YES! "I'll explain the difference in a sec"
Tryna figure out why some Entities in this business won't use there power to build NEW black stars. Same folks from 10yrs ago. #LAMEPICS
Wisdom isn't a quote. It's an experience. People who have the capability to say wise things aren't always wise.

The pain of the distance isn't as bad as the pain of the disappoint.
The road least traveled is usually a hard one. That's why its the "least" traveled. No one wants to work hard but they all want the benefits
One day you wake up and there all gone. But you realize GOD has you right where your suppose to be. Not Everyones meant for this journey!

Dear Atlanta. Please turn up the heat. And turn down the FREEZING!!!
my biggest gift is giving.
my hardest challenge: forgiveness. its my biggest flaw. mainly because im  extremely loyal. its hard for me to rebound when trust is broken
dream and spirit killers are worse than murderers to me. walking around life less and purposeless is worse than physically dying to me.
@HeavenlyHk its been pushed because of shooting schedule. i got something for you when i see you....potty mouth! lol
@ABJColeman is that the opening of the play? and yup were here for a while bro!
theres NOTHING worse than a man who LEADS by his insecurities and self doubt. we all have insecurities just dont let them direct your path!
whats even more interesting is when i see some (in this business) who would give ANYTHING to be famous...not a WORKING actor....but FAMOUS!!
interesting how some get caught up in fame....breath, sleep and eat for it. this is the reason i dont have many friends in this business.
how AMAZIN is it that WE can create just like GOD. he has given us that POWER....its yours use it for GOOD
watching the WORST show EVER created. GOD help the OUR future in television as BLACK people. we have to take better care of our WOLRD image!
lookers line. its your walk, enjoy the steps. some deny your vision but some will see your view. theyll doubt your power till u start to run
@SherriEShepherd I had a   Blast. I hope we didn't scare you to much...LOL I'm being "authentic"

Things i don't understand: how can we be the ONLY people i'n ALL of the universe?
Things i don't understand:  why do some fellas want chicks they know every-other guy boned? Why didn't mona Lisa have eye brows?
Things i don't understand: how can there still be a war going?  How can you get bitten by a shark and still surf? Where is Carmen sandiego?

@TiaMowry absolutly! It's a story that all of us dreamers and realist must see. U should take Cory cuz there is so much about life in there.
An Interseting take on how people live. We are all a product of our choices and haveing the choice is what makes life beautiful.
"Up in the air" made my heart stop. Dope film! Crazy how film can make u confirm and deny all your thoughts about life and love, GO SEE IT!
heres something simple. i LOVE when Sanna Lathan @justsanaa tweets. its just one of those things that makes me smile.
When ur in love nothing else matters. When u need love everything matters. Simple but true. Which one are you?
Takin some time off to see a movie with  a good friend I haven't seen in a while. Sometimes its that simple!

This will be my first newyears on Twitter. I'm excited to share this exp with the world. No matter where I am or u are we will be together!
Sometimes you unintentionally hurt the people you love. But the way they treat you back shows there true charater. Revenge is never good!
You still have time to sew good seed in 09, to insure your 2010 will harvest a great crop.
wonder as far as your mind will take you. allow your dreams to be the road map for you reality. our destinys depend on our will to believe!
monitor your love daily. see how may people love you and how many hate you daily. then make changes accordingly. i bet love will always win
figuring out the mind of some1 who only lives in there mind is like a maze wit no end. no matter where you go it will always b the wrong way
last night i had an epiphany. i will no longer try to figure out why some people do what the do. it only wastes your productive living time
Lessons are always hard but If we open our mind to the possiblity of possibilities you realize EVERYTHING can be a good experiance.
Not everyone is ment to take the journey with you, but the beauty of life is that on this long road there is always more to experiance.
Had to have a porcelain crown from the last time I was here and now the crown is back from being made. :-(

HOLLYWOOD is a weird place............a place i call HOME
i only say it cuz i didnt know it would look so cartoonish. when i read the script i imagioned the world 2 be more real (LOOKING) n my mind

im really late on the TIGER thing. i had NO idea this was going on. WOW. i hope he and his wife can work this out. nobodys perfect!
I have to take my own advice right now. "when some1 is drivin you somewhere u dont want 2 go, get out the car and walk". IM WALKING!
playing GAMES is NEVER a way for adults to cohabitat. in a GAME someone always looses. Life is about WINNING and we are all WINNERS.
but now that i go back and read what i wrote, i guess what i said hit home. cuz it must apply to those who feel the need to respond in code
people dropping hints to hide behind there words= childish
WOW. just noticed something thats so sad. and childish. and the sad part is it had NOTHING to do with the child who did it.
standing alone in your crap is the BEST way to get healin results. dont infect others with your issues. its called being accountable!
sometimes life isnt about YOU and your wants. pushing your issues off on someone else is one of the most selfish thing YOU can do.

Im gonna tell yall something ive never shared...I only have (ONE) fear: Thats Being the only person alive and everyone i love is gone.
my mom had me when she was 18 and went off to college. so my g-parents raised me. we have a friendship thats deeper than a parental bond.
i love my mom. my grandparents raised me so our bond is GODLY. me and my mom are more like bro and sis. we got the same upbringing.
I MISS my grandma (bigma) she was my soul, my air. I LOVE my grandfather he is EVERYTHING i pray to be. & I WISH i could be more satisfied!

Never judge a book by its cover. you thought i was ignorant cause ignorant words were placed in my mouth. its my job NOT my exsistance. lol
WORDS=POWER. SPEAK POSITIVITY INTO THE WORD, SPEAK LOVE, SPEAK THINGS OF KINGS AND QUEENS WHO RULE NATIONS. YOU HAVE MORE POWER THEN U KNOW
@jade_marketa IT IS BAD! BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR YOUR WORDS. THEY HAVE POWER. GOSSIP IS MESS AND MESS EATS AWAY AT POSITIVITY.

@KimmyGotSoul OH SHOOOOOOOOOT. PLEASE FORGIVE.....PLEASE....PLEAE....IM ON ONE KNEE.....OK NOW IM ON BOTH KNEES...LOL
CHALLENGE:  Go to some of the "CELEBS" u follow. scan there tweets and see how much is "POSITIVE" and not full of self serving EGO.
YOU are in control of what YOU allow into your life. DREAM big and live in the reality of your dreams and they will manifest !!!!
@KimmyGotSoul THATS FUNNY. i would love to be that guy. im up for the challenge... how you?
PEOPLE say things here & they put GOD in there TWEETS. But if u pay close attention there words are so FULL of EGO and self righteusness!
DONT let the people you follow on here fool you. YOU know RIGHT from WRONG, GOOD from BAD. Be carful of the "ENERGY" u allow into ur life!!
i need something......i dunno what yet.....when i find out ill tell you.....what do u need?
i mean i do know its not REALLY a teenage love story but thats what it boiled down to, LOVE. and harry is getting OLD. LOL

ask GOD to show you a miracle today. Watch and wait for him to show you who is LORD.
Ok so Ima tell u sum good..."fear" is the root of all evil, it eats away at everything you could ever be. It's not of GOD eleminate it now!
Tell me something good.....
there is a space and time where NOTHING you FEARED, LOVED, HATED matters. That space lives in you daily by letting GO of the past......FLY
