@JenniferTilly My favorite pick up line was from Key Fexer, Jack Binion nephew. He would ask a girl in a bar her name. When she told him, he would say "I had a dream about you. I had your name tattooed on my ass. Go to bed with me and I'll show u. When he undressed, there it was..YOUR NAME.
That's the story in a nutshell. https://t.co/usVE19dCU7
Better training and good coaches. I almost never worked out, running only when I went to meets. Never had a coach that knew the 1st thing about running. https://t.co/1AQvCMqwRq
Times change. The floor man at Bellagio and me were talking sports. He ran 4:05 at San Diego State and couldn't make his team in the mile relay (4 guys run a mile). https://t.co/MwfQFh541S
That's him. Makes me mad when they get the times wrong. I ran against him everywhere in 1952, finishing second in most. I vividly remember the national meet when he ran 4:12 then ran 4:08 in Europe. I almost beat him at the 1952 Border Conference meet when he won the trifecta. https://t.co/fQruTKfkJY
@BrandonBPoker Had no choice. Seems like they were comfortable.

No, basketball and baseball mostly. I never played football. He was my best friend until he died. I loved him like a brother.
In high school I won the state championship with the time of 4:38.1. College I ran 4:18 in the national meet which was a 4th place finish. My nemesis all through my college track days, Xavior Montez, won with a 4:12. I never beat him.😠 https://t.co/cculwLeTfz

@shaundeeb @RealKidPoker @Joeingram1 I played in my regular game at the Bellagio yesterday. The game was full. Every player was a pro.
Do you think I haven't? https://t.co/5QBDxK299a
@markgregorich @RealKidPoker @jeremyausmus @Joeingram1 @ARIAPoker One way to combat this trend is boycott those poker rooms and move to another casino with an open door policy. Small poker games tend to follow the big games. When management sees this, they might reconsider.
Did you say something to make him block you? call him a name? i don't think he would block you merely because you disagree with his political views. https://t.co/Zs9Y7kFjeH
Absolutely. You are anyone else in the world if they have the correct buy in. The buy in is usually 10 big bets. https://t.co/tuJAoiJMZm
There has to be a solution. Some weak pro or good amateur tells all his friends to keep the good players out where they can win all the money. Nothing can be done about that, but in a public casino there should certainly be nobody being barred. https://t.co/RVV1b1k4tm
Please add your input to this thread. This is a complete injustice to allow games in casino's to be "private". If there is a great game at the Aria, I'm not allowed to walk in and take that seat. Neither is any winning pro unless he makes some deal with management. https://t.co/k198pZKBHu
@RealKidPoker @Joeingram1 how player are allowed to say who plays in any game in a public casino is a mystery. the floor people allow people to lock up seats without being there, barring any player deemed to be a winning player in most games. the gaming control board knows this but allows it to continue!
@RealKidPoker @Joeingram1 This is absurd. Private games have decimated casino poker. All the fish are instructed to stay away from the pro's. If you think Bobby's Room games are anywhere as good as they used to be, you are badly mistaken. not only that, management has allowed "private" games in the casino
@CL0WNSHOES Bob Pettit and myself were in the same Dell magazine when they named the top 10 players in 4 different sections of America in 1953. So, I am that old!
@CL0WNSHOES I never had a good basketball coach. Texas was a football state and most didn't care about basketball. I learned by watching closely the best players I played against and then emulating what they did. Arizona had great basketball teams in the 50's and dominated our Conference.
@bubbarainwater Lol...no, he wasn't. Stone killer.
@monica_schutz I'm so sorry about your father. give him by best and prayers will be for him.
Yeah, along with 64 different schools. I had an impressive resume from high school.
I agree about the public opinion making the Rams a 1 pt favorite. Everybody thinks the Patriots will find a way to win, but there are LOTS of professional betters who think the Rams are a steal. Myself? I bet Pats even and then took Rams plus 2. I like my position.🏈🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/LaPwTwZida

I think those % should be reversed. I was way ahead of my time. i see players making some of the same moves I made. I could shoot a basketball really good, regardless of what era it was in. I never got tired but certainly wasn't as athletic as today's players. https://t.co/i3rOzSrYGE

There was no crossover dribble. You had to keep your hand on top of the ball. I was one of the 1st long range jump shooters. I also went to the basket well for my time. https://t.co/FsAXhisz3e
We beat Texas Tech in double overtime to tie Arizona for the championship. (I made 28 pts...lol). Then we had a playoff game with Arizona to see who would represent our conference. We won in overtime. (I had 20 pts). Santa Clara kicked the shit out of us. (I had 9 pts) I sucked)) https://t.co/LIWA62jx0a
@RealKidPoker @shaundeeb @FoulonSmits45 @haralabob @MattGlantz @scott_seiver Shaun, as someone who has managed to stay married for 58 years, you are wrong because Amanda will make it go because she realizes a poker player's lifestyle. That, along with compromise is extremely important.
@robmiech Error...I averaged 14.5 pts per game. also I was voted All Conference and MVP in the Border Conference. Also was 3rd in rebounding in the  Conference, an unusual thing for a guard. Far cry from today's scoring average. I sucked in the NCAA playoff game. https://t.co/ADsbN01m30
No, Hardin Simmons University. We were a small school in a major conference. We had great football teams. The Border Conference was Texas Tech, Arizona at Tucson, Arizona State at Tempe, Arizona State at Flagstaff, West Texas State, UTEP, New Mexico State and Hardin Simmons. https://t.co/dfPqvz9sXT
🤣🤣🤣It's a joke of mine. In 1953 there were only 16 teams in the NCAA tournament. There were no invites. If you didn't win your conference championship, you were not in the tournament. We beat Arizona to win the Border Conference. Santa Clara beat us in San Francisco. HSU btw. https://t.co/p5okjOlHTy

@rackedUp1620 @tazamo1 I guess it's good just to show respect for Gavin even if the money isn't needed. I'm already in on the fund for the kids.
Also, except me, every member of that squad married their college sweetheart and there has been only 1 divorce in the group. I married later and am still married to the finest woman I've ever known 58 years ago.
It finally happened. My college basketball team, who went to the sweet 16, lost our first member. On our 1953 12 man traveling squad I was  20 years old, one of the youngest. All 12 were still alive until last night when we lost our 6ft 8inch center  Hank Green.
@golferjosh You seem to be on top of this Josh. This is surely a rumor, right? https://t.co/zdqxeyrXFL
Is it true that Gavin had a brother that was worth many millions. The kids are supposedly going to live with him. Any truth to this? If so, why are we (the poker community) raising money for them? https://t.co/uIDYZOgrda
I would certainly hope so. When Cowboy Wolford died, Bobby Baldwin and myself each sent 25k, which in todays money would be 50k. Chip, Roger, and many others sent lesser amounts. Gavin wasn't in my generation but I'm donating. We should raise 100k for them. https://t.co/HjXRtOhzzc

@gordoMG I thought i tweeted this earlier but must not have.The main thing I'm looking for in the mix is bad players. You qualify for that but you play so tight it makes bad Tv. But, because of our terrific relationship, I'll be sure to get you on the next one.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/wIHvTcE6pE

I've got several requests to play the mix on Poker Go. We are having it once a month now. If u guys are serious and want to play 1500-3000 mix send your phone # to me. Address it to the Poker Room at Bellagio with my name on it and we can work it out.
We are looking for bad players. Of course you qualify in that department but you play so tight it would be bad tv. but, because of our relationship, I'll see you are on the next one!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/ensBsuHehp

@RealKidPoker I love meat and it has been the staple in my diet all my life. I have to agree with you about the harvesting of these animals usually. As a farm boy, it was different....we never put an animal through "torture" before killing it.
A terrible play by me. Truthfully, I had overlooked my hand and thought I had to draw. After I looked back and saw it was pat, I never regained my thought process. That was the key pot in that tournament, I might have won the tournament if I had been more alert. My bad!!!! https://t.co/r4Ic4OTsfH

Have to answer this one. Against Crandell Addington in a really big game in the 70's. The flop was King-2-4. Crandell had 3 Kings and I had two 7's. I raised him when he bet the flop.

I haven't seen 5 or 7. Personally, I  would remove those 2 along with 8 and 10. Once upon a time in America, Scarface, American Gangster, and The Departed, in no particular order. Also Road to Perdition needs to be somewhere. But u mentioned all of them, so you nailed it. https://t.co/DoK1mIwfsT

@dboissoneau @RealKidPoker @DanOBrienPoker I actually am a freak when it comes to getting tired. My background as an athlete when I was young might be a factor but I think it is DNA. Until I was 60 years old, I never got really fatigued. I could run a mile race and be ready to run another in 10-15 minutes when I was young

Because you are a wimp!  Actually with me it's every time I watch a distance race. I know the emotion of winning and losing because I've experienced both many times. Unlike team sports, it's man on man. Tears flow:-( https://t.co/x6YCszh5nB

@PhilMickelson6 That's a cop out Phil. You snapped, that's what happened. You owe all of us that bet a lot of money on you. You screwed us pal.
I only had 60k bet on Mickelson after his baby outburst on 13. Took a 9, maybe a 11 with a two stroke penalty. @PhilMickelson36 Thanks buddy, you might go visit your pal Billy Walters. https://t.co/Nmdyox6oB6

@DanOBrienPoker Lol....I did lose a 50k package in the mens room at the Bellagio. The rest isn't right. I've never been that mad at my money.
Sitting here thinking about all my pals playing in the 50k. Best tournament of the year....hmmmm. Nope!
@Oscillator_WSOP Tried to send a picture of your card. He gave me a card and a silver bar that was so heavy I had to get my son to carry it out for me. I played a couple of times with Brandon and was impressed with his game. Thanks, meant a lot to me.
It's in, It's in!! Remember Mike? https://t.co/rKmZ4MGhmO
Thanks Chris....everything was taken a little out of context but probably no more WSOP events. https://t.co/tCO4he7unq
Tx Mike. Seems like yesterday. https://t.co/BZ9uCa5Eun
One thing I learned playing this last tournament. Eric Seidel is still one of the greatest poker players on the planet. He was card dead and put on an absolute clinic on how to play a short stack. When I went card dead at the final table I kept thinking about how he played .....
I didn't mean to make such a fuss over my "retirement". I meant probably no more WSOP tournaments. That isn't written in stone however. When they start the mixed games on high stakes poker, I'll be there. Probably not so much cash games but I appreciate all the nice thoughts.
Daniel...you are the best tournament player in the world. Why are you educating people? Don't make the same mistake I did with S/S. I justify my teaching that it created lots of new players that we sorely need. Today there are plenty of players...just saying. https://t.co/nxx840bFiA

you are right. Sammy Baugh was head football coach at my university. I saw him punt the ball out of bounds 10 times in a row inside the 7 yard line from midfield. He still holds punting records in the NFL besides being the greatest passer of his era. https://t.co/YE7y9MX2I1

They listed unbreakable sports records that will never be broken. Byron Nelson's 11 straight wins on the PGA tour probably never will. But Sammy Baugh has one that is impossible to break in the NFL. He threw 4 touchdown passes and in the same game intercepted 4 passes.

Watched the final film of Lonesome Dove, Streets Of Laredo. It might be the best one of all. I know one thing, there will never be another writer like Larry McMurtry. Louis L'Amour might be his equal in western stories but it's close.
Finished watching Comanche Moon. This is before Lonesome Dove. Then  Return to Lonesome Dove then Streets Of Laredo. Dead Mans Walk is  somewhere but doesn't compare to the other 4. Never be another saga of the west and Texas Rangers to compare with these. Absolutely sensational!

I must have the highest rate of being wrong on twitter. Anytime I say ANYTHING someone sends me actual articles saying the opposite. Guess that means I should shut the fk up. https://t.co/41pv1nyY2z
don't think so
I've decided you are right. Attention is what they want. Muting might be the answer https://t.co/w8PEn8dxUR

ok, let me see if you guys can find something wrong with this idea. Best one I've heard yet. Then the lame Congress might have time to pass some kind of gun control. https://t.co/bTuS0a8rAS
mine too https://t.co/RB4Hhk9pUr
Another one. Where do you draw the line? https://t.co/tehXIbcQrv
sigh....yes. https://t.co/OZ9aVIo2eK
Now am I supposed to block this guy? I really would like opinions about that. I forgive all the people I've blocked but I don't forget the reason I block them. https://t.co/G4IN94hqP7
John....I don't know any particulars about Trump's faith. I do know however, he supports Christian beliefs (pro life, conservative judges, supporting Israel, same sex marriage, etc) in most cases. So, who DID you vote for? https://t.co/7IKetTjyFR
Ok. I've said that repeatedly. https://t.co/an44kC7p58
Ignorant? Wanna take an IQ test big brain? https://t.co/4qeROZB82W
Yeah here is an example. Utah lets teachers with permits carry in the classrooms. How many shootings? Zero. Most of you twitter's don't know almost all of these shooters are cowards. If they know guns are in the classrooms, most would go where it was gun free mandatory. https://t.co/GgmYEaE5xX
Absolutely!! https://t.co/YIKgAOpsVh
While this isn't Australia, maybe I'm wrong. Facts are facts. https://t.co/eQl3wTmDWg

helloo...keep listening to them😩 https://t.co/yNwuTYntv1
give him a gun https://t.co/KzIwJQPByt
So what is the answer? You don't have one. I went to a University where the main objective was to have education (teachers) majors. I can assure you, many of them would/could handle themselves. Yeah, let's wait and change the laws. BTW, just finished my top 60 Westerns-))) https://t.co/ejMKiz3YnZ

@igorvolsky What did you expect from MSNBC? Should get CNN to tune in too, they will say the same.
I was wondering where @RealKidPoker was during this "discussion". What is your solution Daniel? Please don't say pass gun laws. That is a long term thing that will never happen anyway. I know there isn't a "good" solution but ......?? https://t.co/uldldsQgNL
Surely this will get Nick many followers on twitter. Follow @NickSchulman. https://t.co/2Kup72O6ux

@KJulius10 No Kyle, you are the "what a guy" person. How do you know what kind of relationship Daniel and I have? Also, what business is it of yours. I hope you are following me where I can have the pleasure of blocking you. Have a nice day.
Lol. Mostly lowball games, certainly not PLO and NLH. https://t.co/4L8AFOHxNO
Ok big time youngster, you take over. I know you have a simple solution. https://t.co/pBf9Tbazh4
We can go on with these arguments forever. If you think a teacher that thinks she/he is going to be shot, isn't going to shoot back, you are nuts imo. https://t.co/fRce0Q7meo
more valid points https://t.co/UfFKUugzm0
Obviously, you are a Democrat.😅 My entire family was teachers. I was supposed to be one also, but as Chip used to say, I chose the most honorable profession. And by the way, my roomy from college went to teach for $2400 a year. https://t.co/Bplel7PQUf

I love guns. Bring them to me! https://t.co/1KPk9kbLfj
Definitely a valid point. https://t.co/31bmGnL6Ra
Nolan...It is the only answer right now. If you think it wouldn't at least slow down these things, you aren't as smart as I thought/know you are.
@MattGlantz @audavidb It's a big problem but what short term solution do you guys have? I'm with Matt on this.
By the way, since you opened your large mouth, you can play the Doyle mix any time you get up enough nerve. But I think you are all talk. https://t.co/sDjZ060pXq
Everybody should watch this. It explains why Christians support trump. We obviously don't like him as a person, but we had to choose between what we were offered. I personally would have liked to have seen Carson, Cruz, or any other Republican be the nominee. https://t.co/ZvrdVOkLzo
At last. Someone with practical sense. It is not very good but can be done immediately. It's easy to say change the law, get rid of the guns, etc but we know how slow Congress is. Something needs to be done now. https://t.co/Uknt2rkBMA

@gordoMG Where are you? I'm working on getting you a stake horse for the WSOP. Nobody can believe you actually won 2-3 tournaments and were POY.
Sure I agree. Not all teachers could handle a gun. I guess it's because I went to college 5 1/2 years to be teaching and I would be completely comfortable with a gun in a classroom. https://t.co/0WH7aWZ7GI

I wonder if you will get as much hate mail as I did when I first suggested that.I saw today Trump suggested that and they posted dozens of answers from teachers opposed to it. A teacher that has never used firearms might be excused but could take training. https://t.co/V4Rtx2hWJA
By the way @gordoMG is looking for a sponsor for the WSOP. https://t.co/GzrwayhK2v
I answered your dm. My reasoning is winning poker players do not need or want to be staked. You see the rest on dm. I answered on twitter because I don;t want a bunch of home town champions wanting me to stake them. https://t.co/GzrwayhK2v

Because it's impossible to get all of the guns in America. One other thing, I remember articles written after WW2 that Japan had decided to not invade America  because they knew the civilian population was armed. Don't know if that's true or not but it makes sense. https://t.co/s7gh6fUydp
Sure, I don't mind folks that disagree with me. They can even insult me to a certain degree but I wonder sometimes if bots are involved. For example when I posted it might be good to arm teachers, I was flooded with disagreement. The next day, over 1/2 agreed. https://t.co/8UvVb80g5f
I think that might be the answer. Believe me, thats giving😎 a lot of latitude. https://t.co/zbjmzdg2De

I keep retweeting these positive tweets to show there is some merit to arming at least a few teachers in each school.  The 1st reaction was violent responses, 240-2. Now over 50% are positive. That means you should think before you speak. https://t.co/Rewwfc7Jg8

I have a masters degree in administrative education and was planning on being a teacher. When I broke my leg, it changed the direction my life took. So I think I have a pretty good grasp on how most male teachers think. Having guns for safety wouldn't pose a problem. https://t.co/LkxswU5dQd

Tony Spilotro was shaking down all the hotel owners. Also, a lot of the poker players. I was from Texas and didn't understand. I told him "Tony u can't kill everybody".

That is the best answer. Train every teacher, male and female, to be able to pass rigid gun training. Then arm them, it's not hard to shoot a gun, especially a shotgun. Just point it and pull the trigger, can't miss at short range. https://t.co/716cWcSnhK

@gordoMG Somehow won a tournament last week. Then he came and played in Bobby's room and naturally he lost. He texted me and challenged a 85 year old man. When there are fish in the pond, I usually go fishing. So I said yes, see you tomorrow. He vanished, haven't seen him since.

My finest moment as a young pro. flop was 7-8-K rainbow. Seat 1 bet, seat 2(Johnny Moss) called. Turn was deuce. Everybody checked. River was three. Seat 1 checked, Moss bet 5 times the pot. My hand was Jack-Ten, I called. Seat 1 passed. Moss had 6-5 drawing at straight.Winner! https://t.co/uM65uoquha
He couldn't raise because nobody bet. If he had bet and the other player folded, I would have called. https://t.co/OamjmTDmhW
Of course.. they were two top pros. I probably should have folded sooner. https://t.co/YD7gwR2Qum

You must be a beginner. Stop and think...what could they possibly have? Wasn't even a difficult fold. https://t.co/VMGUigkmwr
I had 2 aces so i'm guessing there was a pre flop raise.🤣That eliminated either one of these guys having a 5-3 for the straight. It wasn't actually a hard lay down. I was sure one or both had quads. https://t.co/9O0lqTFo2d

Flop was Ace-4-2. I had 3 Aces.Two tight players and myself.I bet, next player raised, 3rd player called. I called. Turn was a 4 and I bet out, next player raise and 3rd player called. River was a 2. I checked, next player bet and next player raised. I folded. Two sets of quads. https://t.co/E26VIeTuRS

I was so sick hearing the same newscast every day I stopped completely. Is it true the democrats are being charged now with Russian ties?🤣🤣🤣

Do you think if you were a robber, would u rather try @RealKidPoker who obviously has no guns, or me. I have a gun almost ALWAYS!
I've been robbed at gunpoint 5 times. Would have been more but the word gets around to the bad guys who have guns and will use them.
Can't believe the argument is still going on about guns. I wanna bet everybody that wants to ban them have NEVER been robbed at gunpoint.
@PokerRob24 At least I'll have an out instead of drawing DEAD
Always have agreed assault guns should be banned, Always! https://t.co/fP8gkNU6lC

McHale was great. When talking about great teams, most don't agree with me. The 86 Celtic team was the best.#5halloffamers https://t.co/iMXgBcXszm

The only reason is his longevity. His career was too short. https://t.co/NkODWfC3P1
You are right. He is best point guard ever. Just didn't know where to put LeBron.Small forward is toughest to pick. https://t.co/lEsDBAXy21
Certainly nothing wrong with several "best 5". Just don't see how Jabbar can be ignored. Longest career, most points scored, etc. https://t.co/mNBJASykkH

I'm betting even money it will be Trump. Any body (and u know who u are)I deem credible DM me. I'm ready to bet a lot, barring death,illness https://t.co/OTWaIX8EaY

At least we have a fighting chance with Trump. I'm scared of him too but I think Hillary was a complete disaster. https://t.co/IpdeMgKfU2
@themouthmatusow Well. we did it bud. Lost lots of followers but when they get too abusive I block them.#NeverHillary

i don't believe the American public can absorb all this info from wikileaks. it is staggering how corrupt this stuff is.
It's a toss up which candidate is worse. An idiot or the most corrupt person to ever run for office. Where are Kasich, Rubio, even Cruz&gt;
I've got a knot in my stomach about this election.I've already voted for Trump but don't like him. I still feel like he is the best choice
Didn't see it if he did. Did u watch Daniel? https://t.co/fkVzYvFEQP
sports book still has Hillary almost 4-1 to win. Hard to believe that's right.

Gotta say one thing for the Clintons. They play to win and use anything. They have all the bases covered but the media is the death bell.

No, I did not nominate Todd for HOF. Yes, I gave him all of my votes. Most folks don't know just how good Todd is at all games, not just NLH https://t.co/FajnkfkUEe

I was going to say why don't you leave if u think that. But then, I see you aren't an American so it's ok-)) https://t.co/xxiSEpNscp
My sentiments exactly. We are going to become a 3rd class country. How can we owe 20 trillion dollars, keep giving money to other countries? https://t.co/PGWdkEpQHs
Hillary is going towin I'm sure. Both candidates can only talk about what's bad about their opponent, not what is good about themselves.#sad
Anybody that think that Trump didn't win the debate is blind. Unfortunately, America is loser whoever wins the election. It is sad!#ggTrump
One of the worst beats...South Carolina plus 7 1/2.  Carolina scored putting game on 7. One minute left, onside kick returned for touchdown.
That would be a hoot!! https://t.co/0pHPMyV3VD

@Erik_Seidel @themouthmatusow Trump took the "high road" last night. I think he lost badly. Watch out 4 next debate. he will be different.
@MattGlantz Imagine this. Hillary..The justice department sued Donald twice....@realDonaldTrump I don't have the connection u and Bill have.
i kinda agree. He laid off all the personal attacks where he could really scorched her. Lots of people thought that was good.@MattGlantz

@RealKidPoker Because he probably isn't as rich as he says. 10 billion is a lot. How about the real figures on the Clinton Foundation.
By the way, nothing against Duthie, I just don't know him.
@RealKidPoker I think your list is a really good one for non-nominated players. Better than the one that's out, with the exception of Duthie
