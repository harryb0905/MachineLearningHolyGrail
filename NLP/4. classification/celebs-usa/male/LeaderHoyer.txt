Tomorrow, the House will vote on @HispanicCaucus Chair @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution to terminate @POTUS’ #FakeEmergency declaration. This is about upholding our constitutional system &amp; I hope every Member votes not for party, but for our democracy. https://t.co/J4YPBJQkWE https://t.co/jMEq03ZajF
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend, @RepDarrenSoto, an important voice for #FL09 and a strong advocate for #OurFellowAmericans continuing to rebuild in #PuertoRico and #USVI.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and new Member @CongressmanJVD, a powerful voice on behalf of #SouthJersey seeking bipartisan solutions as a Member of the @HouseBlueDogs.
Once again, @RealDonaldTrump is pandering to an extreme base, jeopardizing the health of millions by punishing those who choose to provide the full range of reproductive care using other, non-federal funding. I will continue to oppose these efforts.
The Admin’s decision to impose restrictions on medical advice that health care providers share puts millions at risk. @PPFA &amp; health centers that receive #TitleX funding serve millions of women &amp; families by providing health screenings &amp; basic services. https://t.co/1X3mA3dlcK
I'm in #CA51 today with @RepJuanVargas to visit a migrant shelter and receive a briefing on the services that are provided to migrants at the facility. We also heard firsthand how the Admin's policies are making it more difficult for migrants fleeing violence to seek refuge. https://t.co/S884glVfCQ
Wishing a happy birthday to my brother and dear friend, @RepJohnLewis. Thank you for your lifetime of work to demand a more equal, more just America. May you continue to inspire generations of #goodtrouble. https://t.co/H07LiQ1YL5
Appreciated the opportunity to meet with @PGCPS Interim CEO Dr. Monica Goldson this afternoon to learn about her priorities for students in #MD05 &amp; discuss how we can continue to work together to ensure students have the tools they need to succeed. https://t.co/rRib6wZDfE
A number of Republican Senators and House Members are already rebuking President Trump’s decision. They’re calling the move, “unwise,” a “bad idea," and “a mistake.” Read more here: https://t.co/kA72OJQYG7 &amp; RT if you oppose @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeNationalEmergency.
Here’s a look at just how deeply unpopular this #FakeNationalEmergency is with the American people. 6-in-10 Americans don't believe there is an emergency at the southern border &amp; nearly 60% of Americans think Trump is misusing his presidential power. https://t.co/MCuz66jK8Y
.@POTUS also undermined his argument for his costly and ineffective border wall by admitting he “didn’t need to do this.” #FakeNationalEmergency
There is no crisis at the border. I traveled there with House Democrats just two weeks ago, and we heard from CBP, immigration advocates, and migrant families. It’s clear there are security and humanitarian challenges, but no crisis. #FakeNationalEmergency https://t.co/In0bfBP2hz
.@RealDonaldTrump’s #FakeNationalEmergency is irresponsible, violates the Constitution, and makes America less safe. House Democrats are looking at every legislative and legal option to respond.
Pleased to attend today's groundbreaking ceremony at the New Outpatient Clinic at the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home. This facility is long overdue, and I look forward to the day when it can begin serving Southern Marylanders. https://t.co/6Sg2HKKhMU https://t.co/Njun8RBLl7
Happy birthday to the Chair of @NRDems, @RepRaulGrijalva.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepMaloney. Thank you for your leadership as Vice Chair of @JECDems.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepHuffman. Thank you for your work to protect and preserve public lands in California and across the country on @NRDems and @TransportDems.
Wishing a very happy birthday to my friend and Chairman of @HouseForeign, @RepEliotEngel.
Happy birthday to my friend, @RepDelBene. Thank you for your leadership on behalf of working families in #WA01 on @WaysMeansCmte &amp; as Vice Chair of @HouseNewDems.
This morning, I was proud to be at the 38th annual #BlackHistoryMonth Breakfast with members of our community &amp; co-host @RepAnthonyBrown. It’s an event I look forward to each year, &amp; I thank keynote speaker @RepJeffries for his powerful keynote address. https://t.co/E99V0Zrnjl https://t.co/80g5veJpnP
Last week, I traveled to TX &amp; NM with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, &amp; @RepMGS. Despite @realDonaldTrump’s repeated falsehoods, there is not a crisis or national emergency at the border. #FakeNationalEmergency https://t.co/wmBtmNaLbF
Wishing a happy birthday to a strong advocate for #NY04, @RepKathleenRice. Thank you for your leadership as Vice Chair of the @HouseGVP.
I thank my colleague @DavidCicilline for reintroducing the long-overdue assault weapons ban in the 116th Congress. I’m proud to join as an original co-sponsor of this commonsense, bipartisan measure to #EndGunViolence &amp; keep Americans safe. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/NBOGjrQ2Z3
Dems will use every tool at our disposal to protect our Constitution, our laws, &amp; our system of checks &amp; balances.  We will also take action to keep migrant families together, #ProtectDREAMers &amp; those with #TPS, &amp; push for comprehensive immigration reform.
I visited the border in TX &amp; NM last week &amp; can attest that there is no crisis or emergency of the kind @POTUS alleges.  Declaring a national emergency, as I have stated, would be a violation of the spirit of our laws &amp; run counter to our constitutional principles.
Tonight, the House voted to keep government open &amp; serving the American people as well as to improve the security of our borders with smart &amp; strategic investments. It is now up to @realDonaldTrump to sign it &amp; remove the threat of another #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/WDv8V1Rpup
Pleased to stand with @chelliepingree &amp; my House Dem colleagues to introduce legislation to stop the relocation of hundreds of federal employees, which would be extremely disruptive to the mission of @USDA. https://t.co/LyLbOny0tj https://t.co/DIrtnNRt2F
I was at the border last week &amp; can verify that no emergency exists there. @POTUS' decision to declare an emergency is a dangerous ploy. The House will vote for the conf report to keep govt open, but Dems will challenge this irresponsible declaration. https://t.co/oY7PW4E5pY
Feliz cumpleaños to my friend, @RepShalala, a great new Member from #FL27 and a longtime champion for access to affordable, quality health care for all Americans.
Happy birthday to my friend and new Member, @RepAngieCraig, a strong new voice on @TransportDems and the most well-known Jeep driver in #MN02.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepRichardNeal. Thank you for leadership as Chairman of @WaysMeansCmte.
House Dems are meeting that call to action by advancing legislation to require background checks for every firearm purchase &amp; close loopholes. I look forward to bringing this legislation to the Floor in the coming weeks.
In the aftermath of the tragedy in #Parkland, Americans of all ages – but particularly young people &amp; @AMarch4OurLives – took action by marching, raising their voices to say #EnoughIsEnough, &amp; demanding an end to a broken system &amp; loopholes. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain
One year ago today, the #ParklandSchoolShooting upended the lives of students, teachers, administrators, &amp; families of Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS. As we remember those who died, we mourn them &amp; offer comfort to their families &amp; community. #MSDStrong https://t.co/k04ABOIrgW https://t.co/7YvK2Uss1o
I was honored to have the opportunity to pay tribute to my dear friend John Dingell today. He was a great American, a great Member of the House, and a very good and decent man. We will miss him. https://t.co/7GBICyHqUo
Great to see my friend Sharon Murphy, Director of the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home, last night on Capitol Hill. I join in thanking Sharon for the important work she does to ensure our veterans in Southern Maryland receive the quality care they deserve. https://t.co/8U5kKBxsFY
I am troubled, though not surprised, by the news that our national debt just reached a historic high. @POTUS has proven to be one of the worst presidents in terms of fiscal irresponsibility after exploding the deficit w his #GOPTaxScam, which gives 83% of benefits to the top 1%. https://t.co/Esf04xKvlD
Today, I spoke in support of @RepRoKhanna’s war powers resolution that would require U.S. forces to end involvement in hostilities in #Yemen. It is time for Congress to make clear to the Admin that it cannot keep our Yemen policy on auto pilot while the situation deteriorates. https://t.co/3KAbfcOS7S
Happy birthday to Chairman of @HouseAgDems’ Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management, @RepFilemonVela.
Wishing a happy birthday to a new Member and powerful advocate for #TX07, @RepFletcher. I look forward to working with you to improve and invest in Houston’s infrastructure on @TransportDems.
I join in congratulating new Member and new Dad, @RepColinAllred, and his wife, Aly, on the birth of their beautiful son. Sending my warmest wishes to the entire Allred family during this exciting time.
Some states are Red Others are Blue I’m here to protect those with pre-existing conditions  How about you? cc: @HouseGOP #HealthPolicyValentines https://t.co/0KhYG3EowV
Tomorrow marks 1 year #SinceParkland, &amp; I thank @HouseJudiciary Dems for marking up #HR8 &amp; #HR1112—to close background check loopholes for gun sales. Following committee consideration, I’m committed to bringing this overdue legislation to the Floor to #EndGunViolence. #NeverAgain https://t.co/02ISwYhMIE
Finally, the House will vote on a war powers resolution today. #Yemen is a humanitarian crisis &amp; the status quo is not working. Two amendments were made in order, allowing for open, transparent debate on the House Floor.
I also said House Dems intend to bring legislation to the Floor soon to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; #SaveTPS. We also want to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which will require both parties working together. I urge Republicans to partner w Dems to fix our broken immigration system.
I told reporters I believe the conference report is a reasonable compromise, which is being finalized and I expect to bring to the Floor tomorrow. I thank @NitaLowey &amp; @RepRoybalAllard for their work. Another #TrumpShutdown is not an option.
I opened my weekly press conference by discussing my #DemsAtTheBorder trip with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, &amp; @RepMGS. Our conclusion: there is not a crisis at the border. There are challenges that require a mix of solutions, including technology &amp; personnel.
I joined my colleagues on the House steps to pay my respects to my dear friend, John Dingell, as he drove past the House, an institution he cared about so deeply. We will miss him, and our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with @RepDebDingell in the coming days. https://t.co/ICO2vWsq9R

Democrats are committed to reaching an agreement on border security and preventing another Trump shutdown by the Friday deadline. Watch my discussion on @MeetThePress Daily about ongoing negotiations and how another #TrumpShutdown is not an option. https://t.co/EQTJxajdk1
Shutting down the government is not an option. Following my trip to the border, I joined @TeamCavuto to discuss reaching an agreement on border security and preventing another #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/jA3b3uwqfO #DemsAtTheBorder
.@realDonaldTrump is in El Paso tonight to divide &amp; demagogue to make his case for his ineffective border wall. But the facts do not show the need for a wall.

I just visited the border this weekend &amp; we need technology, port infrastructure, personnel, &amp; humanitarian assistance to secure our borders. Dems will continue to oppose funding for a costly and unnecessary wall that does not make us safer or address humanitarian challenges.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney’s comments today were irresponsible &amp; alarming. Instead of threatening another #TrumpShutdown, the Admin ought to reassure federal employees, their families, &amp; Americans that another shutdown is off the table. https://t.co/bBu9aoEFfz
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, and a powerful voice for the First State on @EnergyCommerce, @RepLBR.
While Democrats were at the border yesterday to listen and find effective solutions to the challenges we face, I am disappointed @realDonaldTrump is heading to El Paso tomorrow for a campaign rally to demagogue and divide.
Had an insightful trip to TX &amp; NM w @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, &amp; @RepMGS to learn about challenges at the border. Dems are committed to making smart investments to secure our border &amp; treat migrants w dignity &amp; humanity. #DemsAtTheBorder https://t.co/3vTEiDbtFq
Following our #DemsAtTheBorder trip to Texas and New Mexico, I joined @NPRWeekend to discuss what we heard from advocates, migrant communities, and border patrol about their needs. Listen here: https://t.co/TS78Ay7rYP
I joined @CNN last night to discuss my trip to the border. Securing the border presents challenges, but it is not a crisis that demands a wall. We need smart strategic border security investments and policies that treat migrants with dignity and respect. #DemsAtTheBorder https://t.co/cXiGL9yi63

We visited the site where a child migrant, Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, was apprehended. He later died in the Administration’s custody. We must ensure the safety of children seeking refuge in our country. #DemsAtTheBorder #JusticeforFelipe https://t.co/uON9EnR7iG
We’re touring sites along the border with @CBP officials, including the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry. What we have seen confirms we need smart, strategic investments to strengthen border security and provide humanitarian assistance. #DemsAtTheBorder https://t.co/msWssTAdUh
I’m visiting the border today to hear about the challenges we face. There is not a security crisis that demands a wall, but there are challenges that require smart, strategic, and humane solutions. We’re here to get the facts. #DemsAtTheBorder https://t.co/lk33Acj4nW
House Dems visited @AHouseElPaso, a non-profit providing immigrants with essentials like food, shelter, and a roof over their head. We spoke to a family that was separated &amp; discussed how we are fighting for humane immigration policies. #DemsAtTheBorder https://t.co/PIJ7t0rqtL
I’m visiting TX &amp; NM with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, &amp; @RepMGS. This morning, we met with local immigrant advocates.

For years, I watched my friend John approach policy w a unique blend of ferocity &amp; tact. To all our benefit, he deeply loved this country &amp; took such joy in fighting for its future to be brighter. Read my essay for @TheAtlantic on my friend John Dingell: https://t.co/BDJMCg4aN5
At the request of his wife, my friend @RepDebDingell, I informed the House of the passing of our former colleague, dear friend, &amp; giant of this House, Rep. John David Dingell Jr. May John's legacy guide us forward as we seek to make this House all he believed it could be. https://t.co/IFL6sB0R88
John D. Dingell was my friend.  He was a man of indefatigable spirit who loved life, @RepDebDingell &amp; the House. With his passing, our nation loses a giant whose vision helped improve the lives of millions of Americans over the course of his career. https://t.co/1iS2bGedYA

Today, I was pleased to meet Willie O’Ree, who became the first African-American @NHL player in 1958 &amp; was inducted to the Hall of Fame last year. As we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, I am inspired by Mr. O’Ree’s legacy &amp; thank him for his work to promote diversity in hockey. https://t.co/DxahHSO1YF
I thank the @EdLaborCmte for holding a hearing on the #RaiseTheWage Act. Raising the minimum wage will ensure working people can get ahead &amp; help local businesses by boosting consumer spending.  I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor following committee consideration. https://t.co/YXePHr0RAH
I agree with Chairman @RepJohnYarmuth’s statement at today’s @HouseBudgetDems hearing: the #TrumpShutdown demonstrated the important role of govt services &amp; is an urgent reminder that we must #RaiseTheCaps in order to fund our defense &amp; non-defense budget priorities. https://t.co/IuW6tyyQy7
Appreciate @TransportDems holding an important hearing on #TheCostOfInaction when it comes to our nation’s infrastructure. House Dems are committed to taking action to invest in our nation’s bridges, roads, &amp; seaports &amp; urge Republicans to work with us on bipartisan solutions. https://t.co/PjZBhCEIlW
Looking forward to traveling to TX &amp; NM with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, &amp; @RepMGS. As border security negotiations continue, we will travel to the border to meet with immigrant advocates and receive a border security briefing. https://t.co/IqnzN1lfx3
The American people indicated they wanted to hear a #SOTU focused on the economy &amp; increasing access to affordable, quality health care. Instead the President focused on fearmongering &amp; misleading the public. RT if you agree he’s out of touch. https://t.co/piBe8YYCWT https://t.co/Arrsax0VzC
The cost of #ClimateChange grows every day Congress fails to #ActOnClimate. Today, House Dems held two hearings to understand the impact of climate change on Americans &amp; our economy. The #116thCongress is committed to take action on this critical issue. https://t.co/6nlhX9Cx8c
The @VP’s comment today signals that this Admin believes threatening to inflict pain on the American people is a legitimate strategy. House Democrats &amp; the American people will hold @POTUS &amp; Congressional Republicans accountable if they shut down government again. https://t.co/SxTJEMfV1u
Today, House Democrats held long-overdue hearings on climate change &amp; the multiplying effects on businesses &amp; the environment if Congress fails to #ActOnClimate. Watch here as every one of the witnesses before @EnergyCommerce agree #climatechange is real. https://t.co/E63edyPLsD
My friend @USRepMikeDoyle is absolutely right – the GOP led lawsuit in Texas v. U.S. attacks protections for pre-existing conditions, putting 133 million Americans at risk and raising the cost of health care. https://t.co/VwL0eafn9L
I thank Ms. Heidi Gerding, a #MD05 resident &amp; veteran, for her testimony today about the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on her government contracting business. We’ll continue to remind @POTUS of the consequences of a shutdown for all Americans, not just federal employees.
I was moved by the stories of small businesses &amp; contractors affected by the #TrumpShutdown in today’s @HouseSmallBiz hearing. Appreciate my colleagues highlighting stories of biz owners unable to work &amp; pay their employees or who could not access loans &amp; economic opportunity. https://t.co/RAMXmhvcme
For the first time in nearly a decade, the House is holding hearings on climate change. I thank my colleagues on @NRDems for highlighting how climate change impacts the lives of Americans at their hearing today &amp; looking at ways that Congress can #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/TmtVDkTOIQ
I applaud my colleagues on @OversightDems for holding the House’s second hearing on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, which will help increase access to the ballot box and address the culture of corruption in Washington, among other reforms. https://t.co/hCwbSf6nJy
It is offensive for any Member to claim that a costly and ineffective border wall will prevent gun violence in our country. We need commonsense, bipartisan measures to reduce gun violence, and millions of Americans agree that #EnoughisEnough and Congress must act. https://t.co/yX3kro2ofj
For years, House Dems have called for action to #EndGunViolence, &amp; today @HouseJudiciary is holding a historic hearing on this issue. I look forward to bringing H.R. 8, legislation to expand background checks, to the Floor following committee consideration. #Enough #NeverAgain https://t.co/DyTUJQdnYd
In the wake of the #SOTU, here’s a reminder of the steps @realDonaldTrump has taken to undermine public health and our environment. In the 116th Congress, Democrats stand ready to reverse these harmful actions and #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/2VC3Mnq2hN

Thinking of my very good friend, a giant of the House, and tireless advocate for the American people, @JohnDingell. I’m keeping him, @RepDebDingell, and the entire Dingell family in my prayers. https://t.co/3EBzwb2ORR
When asked about @POTUS’ comments about investigations in his #SOTU address, I said that Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time. We have a constitutional responsibility and obligation to conduct thorough and fair oversight of the Trump Admin.
I told reporters House Dems are getting to work on our #ForThePeople agenda with hearings this week on #HR1; protecting Americans with pre-ex conditions; raising the minimum wage; working to #EndGunViolence &amp; taking steps to #ActOnClimate.
I also said to press I have faith in the DHS conference committee and am encouraged by reports that they are making progress. I hope Republicans will continue to work with Dems in good faith to reach agreement before the Feb 15 deadline. Another #TrumpShutdown is not an option.
I opened my weekly press conference this morning saying that I was deeply disappointed in @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU last night. After promising a unifying message, the President’s address sounded more like a political campaign rally to appeal to his base than a State of the Union.
During his #SOTU, @POTUS claimed that he has improved our nation’s security &amp; international standing, but in reality, his polices have alienated allies &amp; emboldened adversaries. RT if you agree POTUS’ policies have failed to make the U.S. more secure. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/4RtCB6QIyH
.@realDonaldTrump used the #SOTU to continue to mislead the American people on the situation at the border, but there is not an emergency at the border. The only real immigration crises are the ones he himself has created. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/3U8iOwfYV0
Despite what was said in the #SOTU address, here’s a look at @realDonaldTrump’s record on health care. Democrats will continue to defend protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions and work to lower health care costs. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/gjI5dsw9q2
While @realDonaldTrump claimed credit for his record in his #SOTU address, his policies have failed the middle class when it comes to their economic security. Dems are focused on raising wages, &amp; I hope @POTUS will work with us to do so. https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix https://t.co/d1t23u9B18
I thank @StaceyAbrams’ for her #SOTU response, which was unifying &amp; reminded us that America is stronger when we come together to fight for our shared values. Dems will continue to fight #ForThePeople &amp; pursue our agenda to help all working families get ahead. #AbramsAddress
With our new Majority, House Democrats will move forward on the American people’s priorities.  In the weeks &amp; months ahead, Democrats will bring to the House Floor legislation to put government back in the hands of the American people &amp; make it more transparent &amp; accountable.
In his #SOTU address, @POTUS leaned on falsehoods &amp; fear to obscure the reality of a presidency lacking in leadership &amp; harmful to our future. His words continue to make the state of our union more divided &amp; less adherent to our founding values. https://t.co/bVz8AlLcim
In his #SOTU, @realDonaldTrump attempted to take credit for lowering prescription prices, but the truth is that prices increased in 2018. Dems are committed to lowering health care &amp; Rx drug costs in the 116th Congress, &amp; we’re getting to work now to deliver for Americans. https://t.co/SWJySKEbS1
Americans wanted to hear a #SOTU address tonight about the economy &amp; protecting access to affordable health care, NOT @realDonaldTrump’s costly &amp; ineffective border wall. Instead, he spent 20% of his #SOTU fear-mongering to get his border wall.  https://t.co/piBe8YYCWT
#SOTU Fact Check: Tonight, @realDonaldTrump claimed that protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions was a major priority for him. But his Administration has actively sabotaged the #ACA and protections for 133 million Americans who have pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/WSI7HZ38gB
Fact checking the #SOTU : While @POTUS claims the #GOPTaxScam benefited working families, the truth is that it overwhelmingly benefits the top 1% at the expense of working families. https://t.co/IKMArtp7uR
Fact checking the #SOTU: While @POTUS claims ISIS is defeated, just last week the Director of National Intelligence said: “ISIS is intent on resurging and still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria…” https://t.co/z3HhiPAP3D
Trump in his #SOTU: “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.”   GOP Senator Lindsey Graham in March 2017: “The border wall is probably not a smart investment.”
There’s a challenge at the southern border – not a crisis, not an emergency. @realDonaldTrump’s rhetoric about a lawless southern border is nothing more than fear mongering and does not match the reality on the ground. #SOTU https://t.co/rc5p74HnBw
.@POTUS claimed tonight that the U.S. is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 65 years, but his own Energy Dept says that won’t happen until 2020.  #SOTU https://t.co/5jmIZQ8ta0
When the President takes credit for cutting regulations, that means he is gutting clean air and water safeguards that keep Americans safe and healthy. #SOTU
Tonight, @realDonaldTrump is misleading the American people about workers’ wages in his #SOTU address. The reality is that wages grew at the slowest rate in over a year – that’s AFTER the #GOPTaxScam was signed into law – in the last jobs report. https://t.co/JI1SZP0N3I
Looking forward to hearing @StaceyAbrams respond to @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU with an optimistic vision for how we can unite Americans, give everyone an opportunity for a bright future, &amp; ensure working families have the tools to succeed &amp; #MakeItInAmerica. #AbramsAddress
While @realDonaldTrump may claim credit for his policies in tonight’s #SOTU address, a look at his record shows he has failed the middle class and made America less secure. Read how here: https://t.co/zER2qnP2Ix
.@POTUS is reportedly going to speak about working cooperatively in his #SOTU address. I hope he discusses how we can work together, but, more importantly, I hope his actions reflect that rhetoric moving forward. Watch my conversation with @BretBaier: https://t.co/qO1P14lkiP
Excited to welcome Jacqueline Beale to the Capitol this evening as my #SOTU guest. Congress ought to take action to protect Marylanders with pre-existing conditions, and I hope @POTUS speaks to this tonight. https://t.co/tFoBWLEaIb
I discussed my expectations for the #SOTU on @CBSNews. @POTUS has been divisive &amp; confrontational in past addresses. Instead, I urge him to discuss how we can cooperate &amp; work together to reach solutions to the problems that confront our country. Watch: https://t.co/4AVNuKxL5j
Tune in: I’m on @Facebook live w my #SOTU guest, Jacqueline Beale, a constituent, cancer survivor &amp; MD State Lead Ambassador for @ACSCAN. We’re discussing Dems’ commitment to strengthening protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/gmTjepkQwi
I hope @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU address strikes a unifying tone and discusses how we can come together on Americans’ priorities moving forward, including raising wages, investing in infrastructure, and lowering prescription drug prices. Watch my discussion on @BloombergTV: https://t.co/OeLCd9mVj4
Proud to join House Democrats in wearing white or a white ribbon at the #SOTU to send a respectful message that we stand with women across the country and will continue to defend their rights. I thank @HouseDemWomen for leading this effort. https://t.co/fmYpDMfMcY
One of the first actions taken by House Dems in the 116th Congress was to defend the #ACA and its protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions in the courts. We are committed to ensuring those protections, and we will continue to take steps to lower health care costs.
I am proud to announce #MD05 resident Jacqueline Beale will be my guest for the #SOTU Address tomorrow evening. Jacqueline is a cancer survivor &amp; serves as the Maryland State Lead Ambassador for the @AmericanCancer Society Cancer Action Network. https://t.co/7lTWgHXoLp
I thank my colleagues @RepMGS, @RepJoeKennedy, @RepSpeier, and 160 House Dems for taking action to #ProtectTransTroops. I join them in calling on Acting @DeptofDefense Secretary Shanahan to not implement the Trump Admin’s harmful ban that undermines our national security. https://t.co/6Y6Os1uMvo
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Chairman of @AppropsDems’ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, @SanfordBishop.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a new, powerful voice on @OversightDems, @RepPressley.
In celebrating #BlackHistoryMonth together, let us remember how integral African Americans have been to every chapter in the American story.  I look forward to commemorating four centuries of Black History in America &amp; the tragedies &amp; triumphs of the African-American experience.
I am proud to represent communities in Maryland with a long history of rich African-American cultural life &amp; civic contribution, &amp; I am also proud to work closely alongside my colleagues in the @OfficialCBC to advance the causes of equality, justice, &amp; opportunity for all.
As we begin the celebration of #BlackHistoryMonth, we look to the extraordinary story of African Americans in our country, enriching our national life through civic leadership, military service, business, arts, science, literature, sports, &amp; entertainment. https://t.co/tTcDLgFGqM https://t.co/XSEvPusFqR
While @realDonaldTrump is threatening another #TrumpShutdown, here’s a look at House Democrats reminding the President just what’s at stake for hundreds of Americans and the impact of the longest shutdown in U.S. history. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/toQ18sLomB
Americans ought to be seriously alarmed by @POTUS’ feckless approach to our most dangerous adversaries &amp; Putin’s seeming ability to get this Admin to do his bidding. The Democratic-led House will use its proper oversight responsibilities to hold the Admin accountable.
I am deeply concerned by @realDonaldTrump’s announcement today that he intends to withdraw the U.S. from the INF Treaty unilaterally.  I am also concerned that the President once again is proceeding without coordination with our European allies. https://t.co/sjazbtXMKs
Appreciate @HouseAgDems bringing attention to @USDA’s harmful proposal that would cut nutrition assistance for vulnerable Americans. #NutritionAssistance keeps 40 million Americans from going hungry, and this proposal has already been rejected by Congress. https://t.co/0v9xxRhTP6
.@NRDems, led by @RepRaulGrijalva, are collecting stories about how the changing climate is affecting Americans’ daily lives and routines. Submit your #ClimateChangeImpactsMe story here: https://t.co/MusuqVzUeP
At the same time, this #JobsReport reflects a worrying trend–wages are not rising, even in a tight labor market, &amp; January saw the slowest gain in hourly wages in over a year.
The #TrumpShutdown also cost $11 billion in lost GDP, further threatening our markets and economic growth.
Today’s #JobsReport has to be viewed in the context that 800,000 Americans workers effectively had their jobs taken away &amp; were denied 2 paychecks, forcing them to go to food banks or to take out risky payday loans as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/iL1HFfbSg7
I share @RepAdamSmith’s deep concern that @DeptofDefense appeared before Congress for a hearing on active duty personnel at the southern border this week &amp; failed to disclose the planned increase in troops. Misleading Congress &amp; hiding information is unacceptable. https://t.co/pt8yxvvHiL

Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and fellow Marylander, @Call_Me_Dutch. Thank you for your leadership on national security and work on @AppropsDems to fund priorities important to Marylanders &amp; working families across the country.
I am cosponsoring @RepRoKhanna’s War Powers resolution today because the American people &amp; Congress deserve the opportunity to weigh in on U.S.’ involvement in #Yemen. I am committed to bringing this resolution to the Floor after committee consideration. https://t.co/3hwjSalFQH
The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy at least $11 billion.   Today, every Member had the opportunity to vote for a resolution stating shutdowns are detrimental and should not occur. Notwithstanding the significant cost of the last shutdown, 163 House Republicans voted against it. https://t.co/JXBE91jjeS
By refusing to say that they will take shutdowns off the table as an option in their negotiating toolbox, @HouseGOP are sending a dangerous threat to the American people.  How shameful.
Today’s vote requires us to ask why these 163 Republicans believe it was appropriate to have lost $11 billion in GDP, which is what the 35 day #TrumpShutdown cost our economy, according to @USCBO.
Today’s vote begs the question as to whether Republicans support requiring federal employees to work without paychecks or putting aviation safety at risk for travelers or preventing food safety screeners from protecting consumers.
Today, 163 @HouseGOP Members voted against a resolution that says shutting down the government is stupid &amp; bad policy.  It is now clear the GOP has every intention of using shutdowns or the threat of shutdowns as a tactic to help @POTUS get his way. https://t.co/bsJ2aOZKf7
Shutdowns are stupid. Today, all Members of Congress will have the opportunity to vote for a resolution stating that shutdowns are detrimental to our country and should not happen. That is all it says. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes. RT if you agree. https://t.co/gFiIxbtBG0
After the costly #TrumpShutdown, Americans have been reminded how critical federal employees are to our nation’s well-being &amp; security. I spoke on the Floor in support of my bill to provide a 2.6% cost-of-living adjustment to civilian federal employees. https://t.co/r9Q2Wur0Hd
I thank my friend and colleague @RosaDeLauro for her years of leadership on #EqualPay and her work to reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act. I look forward to working with her and @EdLaborCmte Chairman @BobbyScott to bring the bill to the Floor this Congress.
#EqualPay is an economic issue as much as it is a social justice issue. I was proud to bring the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act to the Floor in ’09, &amp; I joined in introducing the #PaycheckFairness Act today. I look fwd to bringing this bill to the Floor. https://t.co/z5zwBN2DrF https://t.co/KOUXkLs1NI
I’m joining my colleagues to reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act in the 116th Congress. This legislation will build on the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act and help ensure #EqualPay for equal work. https://t.co/voNSNChPWy
Thank you @RepMaloney &amp; @RepSpeier for introducing legislation to advance the Equal Rights Amendment in the #116thCongress. I’m proud to support these efforts and all those working across the country to bring about the long overdue ratification of the #ERA https://t.co/mrzP8XkjuO
.@OversightDems’ first committee hearing of the 116th Congress focused on a critical issue that Democrats are committed to addressing: lowering #prescriptiondrugprices and increasing access to affordable, quality health care. https://t.co/KASsSZ0QzG
133 million Americans are living w pre-existing conditions. I applaud @WaysMeansCmte for holding their first hearing on the urgent need to defend these protections and hold the Admin &amp; Congressional GOP accountable for their attempts to remove these protections &amp; increase costs. https://t.co/hpvtXLYmRU
Democrats are for border security, and I believe the Members negotiating a border security deal will operate in good faith to seek compromise. I joined @CNNSitRoom this evening to urge @POTUS &amp; Congressional GOP to work with Democrats to prevent another shutdown. https://t.co/UdUhmorHIL
At today’s hearing, I appreciate that my colleagues on @HouseBudgetDems discussed how the #GOPTaxScam added trillions to the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthiest &amp; large corporations at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/fEhDVbDGaL
Today, @HASCDemocrats held their first full committee hearing on the Trump Administration’s decision to maintain active duty troops at the border. U.S. troops are not a political tool and ought not to be treated as such. https://t.co/eAWWGEogtl
I thank my colleagues on @HouseJudiciary for holding the first hearing on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor to restore the American people’s faith in government once we complete committee consideration. https://t.co/vW2PwFAQZm
For 35 days, @POTUS &amp; the GOP kept the govt shut down, leaving 800k federal employees furloughed or working w/o pay, damaging our nation’s economy, &amp; undermining national security. Here’s why POTUS shouldn’t be threatening to shut down the govt once again: https://t.co/bjqnGyPqMP
Today also marks #Ledbetter10. I was pleased to bring the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act to the Floor ten years ago. I told reporters today that I will join my colleagues to reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act tomorrow to build on this legislation’s progress.
I also told reporters I will bring a bill to the Floor tomorrow to provide a 2.6% cost-of-living adjustment for civil servants. We ought to ensure pay parity between uniformed &amp; civilian personnel. I hope @SenateMajLdr will take up the bill once the House passes it.
I opened my weekly press conference this morning by discussing the @USCBO report that said the #TrumpShutdown cost the U.S. economy at least $11 billion. I’m bringing a resolution to the Floor tomorrow to make clear that shutdowns should not be an option.
Happy birthday to the Chairman of @HomelandDems, @BennieGThompson.
I join in remembering the courage &amp; sacrifice of the crew members of Space Shuttle #Challenger, who perished 33 yrs ago today. I spoke on the Floor that day our nation lost 7 great Americans, including my friend Christa McAuliffe. I keep their families in my thoughts &amp; prayers. https://t.co/fdUxKKt3bw
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a powerful voice for small business owners and working families on @WaysMeansCmte, @RepLindaSanchez.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and new Member, @repdelgado. I look forward to working with you on behalf of families in the Hudson Valley and across the country, including increasing access to affordable, quality health care.
Today’s @USCBO Budget and Economic Outlook report shows @POTUS will go down in history as the worst president in terms of fiscal irresponsibility. There is no question that unified GOP control of govt over the last 2 yrs was an unmitigated fiscal disaster. https://t.co/U8FhSFKjUQ
This shutdown harmed federal employees, small biz, &amp; millions of Americans who couldn’t access government services. I strongly urge @POTUS &amp; the GOP to work with Democrats in good faith over the next three weeks to responsibly fund government and prevent another costly shutdown.
Today’s @USCBO estimate confirms shutting down government is a failed policy that harms our country &amp; people. The fact that the #TrumpShutdown directly cost at least $11B in GDP should give @POTUS &amp; GOP pause before they consider shutting down govt again. https://t.co/KY1Cwv38WO
This work begins and ends with every individual citizen, to whom our democracy ultimately assigns the responsibility of rejecting anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism in any form. #HolocaustRemembranceDay
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember millions of lives taken &amp; communities destroyed. Let us not forget how hatred was spread &amp; doubt was sown in democratic institutions. We must learn from history &amp; confront new challenges w the wisdom of hindsight. https://t.co/H3JWBtmBb4
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepSires. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to improving human rights around the world and building international partnerships on @HouseForeign Affairs Committee.
Tonight the House passed a bill to end the #TrumpShutdown and pay federal employees. I hope the experience of last 35 days has taught Republicans that we should never repeat this exercise of shutting down government again.
The #TrumpShutdown is the latest in a long list of attacks on our federal civilian workforce. This legislation is an important step in treating our federal employees with the respect they deserve &amp; compensating them for the financial stress the shutdown has inflicted on them.
Joined @GerryConnolly to introduce the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019 today, which the House will consider next week to the 2019 pay increase for civilian federal employees in line with the raise given to members of the military. https://t.co/CFtp0LsaWx
It is deeply upsetting that the Trump shutdown inflicted real harm on many families in #MD05.
Today I stopped by the Southern Maryland Food Bank to drop off canned goods collected by members of my staff. The food bank has seen a significant increase in the number of families needing their services in the past few weeks, including many furloughed federal employees. https://t.co/wXZvI6n1OW
The Democratic-led House voted 11 times to end the #TrumpShutdown, &amp; it will do its part again.  Dems have always supported robust border security, &amp; we will work to ensure that we pursue border security investments that are smart &amp; strategic &amp; in line with our nation’s values.
While I’m relieved @POTUS is finally willing to allow 800,000 federal employees get back to work &amp; receive the paychecks they are due – &amp; restore critical services – it is deeply angering that he inflicted uncertainty &amp; insecurity across the country for no reason for 35 days.
It is deeply concerning the extent to which our elections appear to have been influenced by foreign actors who were in communication with close associates of the President.  The American people deserve to know the full extent of what transpired.
The #TrumpShutdown is not a game and has real-world consequences. If this shutdown does not end immediately, the harmful impact will continue to grow. @POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr must reopen government and pay federal employees now. https://t.co/ZpK9VlCMkk
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and fellow Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Safety Caucus, @BillPascrell. Thank you for your commitment to fire safety and partnership to ensure Congressional support for local fire departments.

Grateful that mayors from #PuertoRico came to the Capitol today to discuss the status of recovery on the island &amp; what is needed to ensure #OurFellowAmericans can rebuild stronger. I thank @RepJoseSerrano, @RepDarrenSoto, &amp; @RepAOC for joining this important discussion. https://t.co/vKI1O4Ezsq
Today on the Floor I shared #ShutdownStories of federal employees furloughed or working without pay in Maryland’s Fifth District &amp; urged @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateMajLdr to #EndTheShutdown now.

Happy birthday to my friend, @RepThompson. Thank you for your steadfast leadership and commitment to #EndGunViolence as Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.
The Senate also rejected @POTUS’ demand for $5.7B to build his wall, making it clear that Congress will not support an ineffective wall. POTUS must accept that the way forward is to #EndTheShutdown, pay federal workers, &amp; then we can negotiate a border security measure.
After refusing to hold votes to reopen government for more than a month, Senate Republicans voted to continue the Trump-McConnell shutdown today, irresponsibly ignoring the suffering of millions of Americans who are being impacted.  https://t.co/WKyBdfCnxo
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and @HouseBlueDogs Co-Chair for Policy, @RepOHalleran.
Happy birthday to my friend, @RepGaramendi. Thank you for your leadership as Chair of the @HASCDemocrats Subcommittee on Readiness and for being a champion of the #MakeItInAmerica agenda to help more working families get ahead.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepLouCorrea. Thank you for your service on behalf of #CA46. I’m pleased to see you serving on the @HouseJudiciary this Congress and look forward to working together on issues like immigration.
800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without pay.  These public servants - who ensure the well-being and security of the American people - are standing in food lines.  @HouseGOP, @realDonaldTrump, @SenateMajLdr, have you no shame? #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/Ys2On4qrg2
There are two people holding government hostage – @POTUS and @SenateMajLdr – and @HouseGOP has been complicit in inflicting pain and suffering on our federal employees. Let's vote to open up this government, and then we can resolve the differences we have on border security. https://t.co/7OyhQyHwPW
Tony Reardon, @NTEUnews President, also spoke at the #FundTheFrontline &amp; highlighted how many fed employees are currently working overtime &amp; double shifts during the #TrumpShutdown, yet they aren’t being paid. We must #EndTheShutdown now.
Another panelist featured at #FundTheFrontline is @AFGENational President @JDavidCoxSr, who shared startling statistics about turnover as federal employees miss a second paycheck since the #TrumpShutdown began 34 days ago.
Durkovich also highlighted the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on both federal employees and government contractors. There are already reports that top talent is being recruited away from @DHSgov due to the shutdown and lack of continuity. We must #EndTheShutdown.
Caitlin Durkovich, former Asst. Sec. for Infrastructure Protection at @DHSgov, spoke about the importance of data collection &amp; info sharing that is on hold due to the #TrumpShutdown. Failing to #FundTheFrontline impacts our nation’s ability to strengthen election security.
At today’s #FundTheFrontline event, emergency preparedness professional &amp; former Deputy Administrator for Protection &amp; National Preparedness at @FEMA highlighted how much disaster recovery work is on hold right now due to the #TrumpShutdown.
The first panelist, Vice Admiral Peter Neffenger, a former Administrator of @TSA and former @USCG Vice Commandant, discussed the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on recruiting new service members in the Coast Guard. It is time to #EndTheShutdown &amp; #FundTheFrontline.
I thank my @HomelandDems colleagues for hosting the #FundTheFrontline event highlighting the negative impact of the #TrumpShutdown on frontline homeland security personnel and agencies many of whom are furloughed or working without pay. Tune in here: https://t.co/TJMG6reqMT

Today on the Floor, I said House Democrats have offered alternative after alternative to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; reopen government. So why is government still shutdown? Because @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateMajLdr won’t take yes for an answer. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/tJrCy4MDIW
House Democrats are voting for the tenth time to reopen government &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. It is time for @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SenateMajLdr to #EndTheShutdown so discussions on border security can continue. Watch my discussion on @MSNBC here: https://t.co/iJBLF4qZId
.@POTUS said he would be proud to shut down the government and that he would own it. 33 days into this #TrumpShutdown, poll after poll shows he does own it. The American people overwhelmingly believe POTUS is responsible &amp; govt needs to be reopened now. https://t.co/OBIvxtwzSV
At my pen &amp; pad with reporters, I said that Democrats are willing to negotiate a border security deal but @POTUS and @SenateMajLdr must first open up the government and then we can work on a border security compromise.
I also said to press that that I will bring to the Floor a package of six funding bills to reopen government today, which is a product of bipartisan negotiations.  Republicans have said they would support this legislation, and I hope they will do so today to #EndTheShutdown.
Today I opened up my weekly press conference by saying every American ought to be disappointed in the Trump-McConnell shutdown. This 33 day shutdown is unacceptable and only our adversaries can be happy about this hostage-taking of our government.
In a letter to @SenateMajLdr, I joined House Dems in sharing #ShutdownStories from federal employees in #MD05 and across the country who are furloughed or working without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown. Our message to him is simple: #EndTheShutdown today. https://t.co/Be3J1ApBDl
The #NATO alliance is central to American security and maintaining peace and stability worldwide.

I will continue to stand up in defense of #LGBT Americans to be accepted equally in our country in every way. I hope the courts will eventually strike down this ban and reaffirm the principle that all Americans should be treated equally. #ProtectTransTroops
The Administration’s ban sends the wrong message to transgender people in our country that they do not have an equal place in our society.  This ban not only discriminates; it also denies us the service of talented Americans and makes our country less safe.
I am very concerned that SCOTUS is allowing the Trump Admin’s #TransMilitaryBan to continue discriminating against transgender Americans wishing to serve their country as litigation on this issue makes its way through the courts. https://t.co/ePMLId7PqN

I urge the Senate to reconsider their position &amp; join the House in protecting the American people against foreign interference &amp; corruption. https://t.co/tpHXVsBIRR

House Dems once again voted to reopen govt while 187 @HouseGOP voted to keep it shut down.

90 years ago today, our nation was blessed with the arrival of one of the brightest lights in the history of our country. May Dr. King’s life continue to inspire those who seek to heal an ailing nation &amp; repair a broken world. #MLK90 https://t.co/CCEoRhtKM9
I’m glad that a judge acted to prevent the Admin from tampering w the #2020Census. It is shameful that they sought to undermine the census by deterring immigrant populations from participating through an untested &amp; irresponsible question on citizenship. https://t.co/mL9d1kGwdR
I just voted again to reopen the government and end the #TrumpShutdown, which is harming federal employees, the public they serve, and our economy. How is the #TrumpShutdown affecting you? Be sure to share your shutdown story at https://t.co/3iFE6HRlxn. https://t.co/HQ8EZUbssG
The @HouseGOP has rejected a responsible path forward, which is to end this shutdown immediately &amp; reopen govt while discussions continue. Dems will continue to bring measures to the Floor to reopen government.  This Trump shutdown must come to an end. #EndTheShutdown
Today, I brought to the Floor a continuing resolution to reopen the government through Feb 1 so that federal employees can get back to work serving the American people.  It’s unacceptable that 187 Republicans voted to keep the government shut down. https://t.co/3PGEGgTonz https://t.co/yFTNcTiwsa
I strongly support efforts to make clear that the House will not tolerate such hateful speech &amp; urged Members to vote for @WhipClyburn’s resolution today. Congress must set the tone for the country, &amp; when a Member of this body diminishes it, it diminishes us all as a nation.
There can be no room for racist &amp; bigoted language aimed at hate &amp; harm in our national discourse, &amp; I join in the wholehearted condemnation of Rep. Steve King’s comments.
Read my op-ed in @CapGazNews about the need for @POTUS &amp; Congressional Republican leaders to work with Democrats to reopen the govt &amp; put thousands of federal employees &amp; contractors back to work. https://t.co/1MCP8XWZgq
Thank you @RepSpeier for documenting these powerful Trump #ShutdownStories. @POTUS, these @NASA engineers are unable to work due to your govt shutdown. It’s time to reopen govt &amp; get thousands of civil servants back to work serving the American people. https://t.co/ALdJZPmALW
It is imperative that Congress has the opportunity to vet in full any settlement regarding Mr. Deripaska. He has been key to much of the malign activities Russia directs against the U.S., and Congress must protect the American people against foreign interference &amp; corruption.
Secretary Mnuchin’s briefing last week raised more questions than it answered, and, notwithstanding the good faith efforts of individual Treasury officials, I cannot help but view this action in the context of the Trump Administration’s repeated deference to Russia.
I am introducing a resolution to prevent @USTreasury from lifting sanctions on businesses controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who has been sanctioned for his close relationship to Putin &amp; activities aimed at harming the interests of the U.S. https://t.co/rs9A4xjQDk
It is unacceptable that @POTUS and Congressional Republicans are holding government hostage and denying paychecks to 800,000 Americans. Democrats will continue to vote on legislation to reopen the government &amp; urge @SenateMajLdr to take up that legislation to #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/u5HOeeOSBT
At my press conference I said I support @WhipClyburn’s resolution rejecting white nationalism &amp; white supremacy following Rep. King’s comments. I hope the House passes it unanimously and makes clear this hateful rhetoric has no place in Congress.
Tomorrow, I will join @BobbyScott to introduce the #RaiseTheWageAct to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I think Chairman Scott for taking quick action to introduce this bill &amp; I look fwd to working w him to bring it to the Floor after committee consideration.
I also told press this morning the House will vote on a supplemental approps bill tomorrow to provide relief &amp; recovery assistance for #OurFellowAmericans affected by hurricanes, wildfires, &amp; other natural disasters. I hope to see a strong bipartisan vote.
I opened my weekly press conference by discussing how House Dems have already voted 6 times to open up government; we will vote every day this week to end the #TrumpShutdown. I urge @senatemajldr to take up House-passed bills &amp; send them to @POTUS.
.@POTUS &amp; Congressional GOP are holding the American people hostage w the longest govt shutdown in history. Take a look what Americans in all 50 states are saying about the harm the #TrumpShutdown is inflicting on them, their families, &amp; their communities: https://t.co/BbR3Pp95Cw

House Democrats are continuing to do everything in our power to end this Trump shutdown &amp; put our government back to work for the people it serves.  If @SenateMajLdr wants this shutdown to end, all he has to do is allow the Senate to vote.
This week, House Democrats will bring to the Floor continuing resolutions to reopen government and end the #TrumpShutdown.  There is no reason for Republicans to keep government shut down while discussions continue over how best to secure our borders. https://t.co/qz311Vb2am
I launched a new website to allow Americans who are impacted by the #TrumpShutdown to share their story &amp; to ensure those stories are shared w Congress. Dems will continue to pass legislation to reopen govt &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown. RT to spread the word. https://t.co/mTBnHu8tio
The Republican shutdown has extreme consequences for thousands of Maryland families. It's inexcusable that Marylanders lost $778 million in wages because the President is holding the government hostage.  https://t.co/KRxCSG9ICf
We can reopen government right now if @SenateMajLdr will bring GOP funding bills that the House passed to the Senate Floor for a vote. I urge him to listen to GOP Senators calling for an end to the #TrumpShutdown. Let’s reopen government &amp; get Americans back to work. https://t.co/tGnO8SGZHQ
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @JacksonLeeTX18. Thank you for your commitment to renew the long overdue Violence Against Women Act.
Today, @RepKatieHill, @repdavidtrone, and I visited @FAANews, @HUDgov, @US_FDA, &amp; @NOAA in DC and MD—all of which have large portions of their federal employee workforce furloughed or working without pay due to the #TrumpShutdown. Video message coming soon—stay tuned! https://t.co/idaXzfACMp
America’s small businesses cannot access critical loans due to the #TrumpShutdown. I thank @HouseSBCDems Chair @NydiaVelazquez for demanding answers from the Trump Administration about how small businesses are being affected. https://t.co/07gLdqIEk7
No American should have to go w/o a paycheck just because POTUS thinks he can bully Congress into giving him what he wants. Today, I spoke on the Floor in support of legislation to ensure 800,000 federal employees who are furloughed or working w/o pay receive the pay they’re due. https://t.co/oQ34gYOhWD
I agree with GOP Senator Collins—the #TrumpShutdown is hurting 800,000 federal employees who are either furloughed or working without pay. @SenateMajLdr ought to listen to GOP Senators who are speaking out and bring House-passed legislation to the Floor to reopen government. https://t.co/8H2sgN19Ij
Right now, 800,000 federal employees and the millions of Americans they serve are being left out in the cold because the President is holding government hostage. Watch my discussion on @NewDay about the need to reopen govt &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/vSxGp41UAs
Joined @SquawkCNBC to discuss how the GOP consistently pursues government shutdowns as a strategy to achieve what they otherwise could not achieve through the democratic process. By doing so, they are inflicting great harm on federal employees and the American people they serve. https://t.co/0IvmNs6gIi
While Senate GOP refuses to end the #TrumpShutdown, House Dems &amp; some responsible Republicans voted to restore pay to security agents at airports &amp; federal aviation safety inspectors, put an end to delays for mortgage applications, &amp; avert a crisis for low-income rental housing. https://t.co/WHYTHHtVBh
Today, House Dems &amp; some responsible Republicans passed a bill to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; reopen part of govt to provide 40 million Americans facing hunger w nutrition assistance.

The #TrumpShutdown is inflicting real hardship on Americans. The Commander-in-Chief shouldn’t be putting Coast Guard service members in the position of selling their belongings. It’s time to reopen govt &amp; ensure public servants receive the pay they’re due. https://t.co/1ZiGQV5JC5
We need to secure our borders but there is bipartisan agreement that a border wall is not the best way to do so. On @CNN, I discussed how this is not a partisan difference but a policy difference. There’s no reason to keep government shutdown while those differences are resolved. https://t.co/PQ2r3SWtFN
I was moved to share this morning with my good friend, the courageous @GabbyGiffords as House Democrats renamed our Cloakroom in her honor along with the late Rep. Leo Ryan. Democrats will continue to honor her with action on #HR8 to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/S2cP97CeeA
On this #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, I thank the men and women in uniform that put their lives on the line to protect and serve the U.S. Capitol, Marylanders, and the American people every day.
House Dems, on the other hand, have delivered on our promise to stand up for protections for Americans w pre-ex conditions. We will never waver in our determination to continue working to bring down health care costs, make coverage more accessible, &amp; improve the quality of care.
With today’s vote, the overwhelming majority of @HouseGOP showed their true colors by voting against protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/yk08er0LzQ
It is now up to @SenateMajLdr to bring this bill to the Floor in the Senate and allow it to go to @realDonaldTrump’s desk. Leader McConnell has no excuse not to help end the shutdown, and I urge him to take responsibility and do his part to reopen government.
Today, House Dems &amp; 8 responsible Republicans passed legislation to reopen part of the govt. The bill will reopen several govt agencies, including @USTreasury &amp; @IRSnews, allowing returns to be processed so taxpayers will receive their refunds promptly. https://t.co/hmUFtVnZts https://t.co/X3ha4kefEK
The #TrumpShutdown has consequences for thousands of Marylanders. Joined House Dems, @AFGENational, &amp; @NFFE_Union to call on @POTUS to reopen govt. We will continue to advocate for federal workers &amp; ensure they receive the pay they are due. https://t.co/5E0T3dKRKJ https://t.co/oEs2HWUSuT
This is not a partisan difference but a policy difference as to the best way to effect border security. The President walked out, as he has walked out on the federal workforce and the American people. It’s a sad day for the country.
.@POTUS’ behavior at today’s meeting with Congressional leaders was a display of disrespect for his responsibilities, the pain he is inflicting on the federal workforce, &amp; the millions of Americans who deserve to have the government operating effectively. https://t.co/jnbzsWoifq

It’s been 18 days since @realDonaldTrump shut down the government. Since @POTUS &amp; Admin officials have consistently misled the public about the situation at the border &amp; the need for a border wall, here’s a look at the facts: https://t.co/JnI2iMplFO #TrumpShutdown
Dems are willing to negotiate border security, but there is no reason to keep government shut down while those discussions continue. I continue to urge @SenateMajLdr to take House-passed bills up &amp; @POTUS to sign them to reopen govt while we negotiate border security.
Tonight, @realDonaldTrump peddled falsehoods to the American people live from the Oval Office, &amp; made it clear he will continue to hold the health, safety, &amp; wellbeing of millions of Americans hostage until he gets his way. https://t.co/G1kLazPLIa https://t.co/77IZykQCpr
Gun violence has become an epidemic in our country, but it is a preventable one &amp; Dems will take action to address it. As we mark this somber anniversary, let us remember the victims in Tucson and salute @GabbyGiffords &amp; other survivors for their courage and perseverance.
8 years ago, @GabbyGiffords was nearly killed in a horrific act of gun violence that killed 6 Americans. I’ve been proud to stand w her, @ShuttleCDRKelly &amp; House Dems to end gun violence &amp; as we introduce #HR8 to require comprehensive background checks. https://t.co/AUOlgQAwXY
The GOP is once again using a govt shutdown as a strategy to achieve what they cannot through the democratic process. They are harming the livelihood, morale, &amp; mission of civil servants, small biz, &amp; others as a result. Read #TrumpShutdown stories here: https://t.co/64sxt9YiLu
The #TrumpShutdown is not only leaving 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working w/o pay, it’s also hurting small businesses who rely on loans &amp; services from the Small Biz Administration. Read more in this report from @HouseSBCDems: https://t.co/z8umLU7Dfh
Last week, @RepSarbanes &amp; House Dems introduced H.R. 1, a government reform package to clean up corruption &amp; restore Americans’ faith in government. I told reporters I look forward to bringing it to the House Floor for a vote after its consideration in committee.
While speaking w press, I said the House will vote on Title III of the Rules package that affirms protections for 133M Americans w pre-ex conditions. The GOP claimed during the election they support these protections. This vote will show the American people if that is the case.
Dems are willing to negotiate border security, but there’s no reason to hold government hostage while those discussions continue. The Administration continues to push for walls or fencing – experts agree neither are effective solutions to secure our borders.
I told reporters that House Dems will bring bills to the Floor every day to reopen the govt &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown so taxpayers can receive tax refunds, families can receive nutrition assistance, families won’t be evicted, &amp; Americans can safely enjoy national parks.
Today I opened up my weekly press conference by reading a quote from @SenateMajLdr in 2014: “Remember me? I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns… It's a failed policy." If McConnell believes that, he should put the House-passed bills on the Floor to end the #TrumpShutdown.
The 2018 State of the Bay ought to alarm all Marylanders. The Trump Administration’s repeated efforts to defund programs that work to #SavetheBay have serious consequences. We must work together to protect our natural resources. https://t.co/97pJ9sgkeK
I urge Leader McConnell to put an end to this shutdown by putting these bills on the Floor as soon as they pass the House.
It is unacceptable that Republicans are once again pursuing a government shutdown as a strategy to achieve what they otherwise could not achieve through the democratic process. In doing so, they are harming federal employees and the American people they serve.
When the House passes four appropriations bills to reopen government this week, @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; Senate Republicans will have no excuse to avoid taking action to end the #TrumpShutdown of the agencies they cover. https://t.co/a44QDDByot
Joined @MeetThePress to discuss Dems’ commitment to ending the #TrumpShutdown. We’ve passed compromise funding bills that the Senate GOP previously supported. I urge Leader McConnell take up the bills to reopen govt &amp; we can continue to discuss the best way to secure our borders. https://t.co/hSxcJrRJQV
Looking forward to joining @ChuckTodd on @MeetThePress this morning. Be sure to tune in. #MTP https://t.co/8lcd3mn2Ro
This week, House Dems passed Senate Republican funding bills to reopen govt. But rather than take up &amp; sign those bills that are agreed on, @SenateMajLdr &amp; @POTUS are refusing to end this #TrumpShutdown. Read how the impact of their shutdown is growing: https://t.co/WUBmNbssuW
Now that the Senate has done its job, I hope the EAC can move forward with a robust effort to protect our election systems from foreign interference and ensure that every eligible voter in this country can cast a ballot and have a voice in our democracy.

I applaud @RepSarbanes for his tireless leadership on this and other government reform efforts, and I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor once the legislation is considered in committee.
Proud to cosponsor the #ForThePeople Act, the first major bill to be considered by the new Dem Majority. Dems are determined to clean up corruption &amp; restore the American people’s faith that govt can be a force for progress. H.R. 1 is a major first step. https://t.co/9w1590x7JA
I call on @SenateMajLdr to allow the Senate to vote on the measures House Dems passed last night to end the #TrumpShutdown, reopen govt, &amp; provide retroactive pay to those who have been forced to go without a paycheck as a result of the #TrumpShutdown
It is outrageous that @VP Pence &amp; hundreds of political appointees will each receive a $10,000 raise while denying paychecks to 800,000 federal employees as they keep the government shut down. https://t.co/Sf4K1E98uy
Last night, the House voted to end the #TrumpShutdown. It’s time for the Senate to pass this legislation &amp; @POTUS to sign it. I urge them to stop holding federal employees &amp; the people’s government hostage. Watch my discussion of the shutdown on @Morning_Joe: https://t.co/jg0b1NMeJi

Now that Dems control the House, we will pursue responsible fiscal &amp; economic policies that expand opportunity for our people &amp; promote certainty in our markets. I urge the GOP to set aside partisanship &amp; strive for common ground in pursuit of this common cause.
While an encouraging indicator of our resilient economy, the final #JobsReport of 2018 comes as the economy shows unsure signs of its direction. The Admin’s poorly thought-out economic policies are taking a toll on small biz, farmers, &amp; working families. https://t.co/Nsq3gicQ4s

In Dec., @POTUS declared that he would be proud to shut down the govt if he didn’t get his way, holding 800,000 federal employees &amp; the American people they serve hostage. Nobody has any doubt about who started this shutdown. Tonight, Dems made it clear who is working to end it.
Tonight, the Democratic-led House passed legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government.  Now it is up to Leader McConnell to bring it to the Senate Floor and @realDonaldTrump to sign it.  https://t.co/vFXjzMnamH
Tonight, every Dem &amp; a few responsible Republicans passed the Senate GOP appropriations package to reopen govt. I urge @senatemajldr to take up &amp; pass this legislation and send it to the President for his signature. It's time to take yes for an answer and end the #TrumpShutdown.
The bills that the House will pass tonight are proposals that Senate Republicans already agreed to. After the House takes action tonight, I strongly urge @SenateMajLdr allow a vote in the Senate and send them to the President so we can end this #TrumpShutdown.
Holding 800,000 federal employees &amp; the government hostage is not what the American people want. Tonight, House Democrats are putting two bills on the Floor to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; reopen government. https://t.co/5bBVEHpeXA https://t.co/Nbm1UNH1Yd
Happy birthday to a brand new Member of Congress, @katieporteroc. Congratulations on being sworn in as a Member today, and I look forward to working with you in the 116th Congress.
Today, Democrats passed a Rules package that signals a new start for the House. We will go from the most closed Congress in history to a period when Americans finally have a House that is on their side. We will make government work again for those it serves. #116thCongress https://t.co/yDOmQYxX17

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepVeasey. Thank you for your leadership and advocacy on behalf of America’s working families as Co-Chair of @BlueCollarDems.
Today, I will bring two bills to the House Floor to reopen government &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown. House Dems are offering Senate GOP &amp; @POTUS the opportunity to sign bills they already said they were for. Listen to my discussion on @MorningEdition: https://t.co/SRB1c2kJa2
House Democrats are bringing two bills to the House Floor today that do all of those things while reopening the government. I look forward to you signing them into law and ending the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/K5EULJsLUj
Coupled with his dangerous and reckless announcement last month removing U.S. forces from Syria, President Trump’s statement today that Iranians can do what they want in #Syria highlights his bankrupt foreign policy, one which creates a vacuum for adversaries to exploit.
It is unconscionable that @POTUS would sit in the White House and say that #Iran and its proxies ought to be allowed to take up positions on the borders of our closest regional allies.  https://t.co/9RfcL58lk1 https://t.co/lRwzQYgSJ5

I wish everyone a happy &amp; healthy New Year. As 2018 comes to a close, I remain concerned about how the #TrumpShutdown is affecting Coast Guard service members, federal employees, contractors, &amp; the public. The Dem-led 116th Congress will work to reopen government immediately. https://t.co/0ufKQMYUkk
It is time to end this unnecessary shutdown &amp; put the federal government fully back to work serving the American people. I hope the Senate will act swiftly &amp; approve these measures with the same strong support it did before. I urge the President to sign these bills without delay.
Each of these will be identical to measures that unanimously passed the Senate Appropriations Committee during the 115th Congress, four of which passed the full Senate, with the addition of a measure to ensure back pay for federal workers furloughed because of the #TrumpShutdown.
When Dems assume control of the House, I will bring two bills to the Floor aimed at ending @POTUS’ costly &amp; dangerous #TrumpShutdown. The 1st will be 6 of 7 remaining appropriations bills for FY 2019, &amp; the 2nd will fund @DHSgov at current levels to 2/8. https://t.co/2RvnAHGxqd

Republicans’ strategy of shutting down the government is harmful to our federal employees and the public they serve, and it undermines the confidence of the international community. Watch as I discuss the #TrumpShutdown on @CBSEveningNews: https://t.co/Wh3ghndt8L
Due to this #TrumpShutdown, this is not a happy holiday for so many hard working federal employees who are furloughed or forced to work without pay. House Democrats continue to call on @realDonaldTrump &amp; House GOP leaders to work with Democrats to reopen government. https://t.co/5A3ROBezkv
I joined #MTPDaily today to urge @realDonaldTrump &amp; GOP leadership to end the #TrumpShutdown. If they continue this shutdown, Democrats will offer a bill on January 3 when we take control of the House to reopen government &amp; ensure federal employees receive the pay they are due. https://t.co/uHf4FzB5Lq
Since these protections were put in place, mercury pollution from power plants has declined over 80%. In addition, the protections would prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths from asthma, other respiratory diseases, or heart attacks.
Even during the #TrumpShutdown, the Admin’s @EPA is finding a way to help big polluters at the expense of public health. Rolling back these protections does not make sense. The majority of utility companies have already installed clean-air tech to comply. https://t.co/gwH5W8W1vk
I continue to call on @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP to work with Democrats to reopen the federal government, ensure federal workers receive the pay they are due, and provide certainty to the American people.

The Commander-in-Chief's #TrumpShutdown is negatively affecting our nation’s service members &amp; their families.

It is incumbent upon Congress to ask serious questions about what happened. After the new Dem Majority begins, the House will hold hearings on this young boy’s death &amp; the death of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal earlier this month &amp; the conditions under which thousands are being held.
I am heartbroken by the tragic news that another child has died in the custody of federal agents. I pray for comfort for the families, &amp; I urge @DHSgov to provide Congress with the info the public deserves to know &amp; take action to prevent such tragedies.  https://t.co/Qm27BDTDwd
Wishing a #MerryChristmas to all those celebrating today. In particular, I’m thinking of fed employees who are furloughed or working w/o pay over the holidays due to the #TrumpShutdown. House Democrats stand with you &amp; urge @realDonaldTrump to end this needless shutdown. https://t.co/2iAqEs8VWF
.@RealDonaldTrump said he is “proud” to shut down the government for his costly, ineffective border wall, but his #TrumpShutdown means 90% of @DHSgov employees are forced to work without pay during the holiday season. https://t.co/p53XmnCdgv
The majority of Americans don’t think a #TrumpShutdown is good policy. @HouseGOP &amp; @RealDonaldTrump ought to work with Democrats to reopen the government now &amp; ensure hardworking civil servants who are furloughed receive their pay retroactively. https://t.co/PM80hvdeJk

Federal employees – including law enforcement, TSA screeners, Forest Service firefighters, &amp; others – are furloughed or forced to go without pay as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. I call on @HouseGOP &amp; @POTUS to end this reckless shutdown &amp; reopen government as soon as possible.
The #TrumpShutdown is having a real, negative impact on civil servants who ensure the well-being and safety of the American people. No American should be unable to pay their mortgage because of @realDonaldTrump’s temper tantrum. RT if you agree.  https://t.co/xXYtMoLXSM
The #TrumpShutdown is a very irresponsible action taken by @POTUS, who swore an oath to serve the American people &amp; serve them well. It's unfortunate that shutting down govt is a policy being pursued by the GOP to achieve what they can't achieve through the democratic process. https://t.co/xctgefuhus
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a powerful voice for Iowa’s working families on @EnergyCommerce, @daveloebsack.
Dems have now offered 3 compromise agreements to forestall &amp; end this unnecessary &amp; costly #TrumpShutdown. The GOP &amp; @POTUS have rejected every one, instead opting to create chaos &amp; shut large parts of the American people’s government down. Shame on them.
I went to the House Floor to ask for the House to take up &amp; pass my bill to end the #TrumpShutdown. It is identical to the bipartisan, Senate-passed Continuing Resolution to fund govt through 2/8.    @SpeakerRyan did not even allow me to ask the question. https://t.co/rlFWs5BqQd
I've cosponsored a bill to ensure federal workers receive back pay during the #TrumpShutdown because civil servants should not be punished for the chaos sown by the GOP. The Senate passed this bill &amp; the House should take it up &amp; pass it as well. https://t.co/veXBnJSX4U
Just before Christmas, @POTUS has shut down the government over his costly, ineffective border wall. The #TrumpShutdown leaves 800,000 federal employees without pay over the holidays &amp; negatively impacts the safety and well-being of Americans. Learn more: https://t.co/Fs4s1iraej
This #TrumpShutdown is deeply unfair to the federal employees &amp; is detrimental to their mission of ensuring the safety and well-being of the American people. Watch my discussion with @JoyAnnReid this morning. https://t.co/6N5X0eESdp
There is bipartisan support for border security, but it should be clear to @POTUS that he doesn't have the votes for a border wall. Watch my interview with @TeamCavuto on how the President should compromise &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/myPVSgDiuo
Democrats support border security, but we don’t believe a border wall is an effective use of taxpayer dollars. I joined @CNN this morning &amp; urged @realDonaldTrump to come to a compromise &amp; end this #TrumpShutdown so government can work on behalf of the American people. https://t.co/DxV9UwHFk5
The #TrumpShutdown strategy that has been pursued by Republicans is no way to run a government. Watch my interview with @SteveKornacki on @MSNBC on the need for @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP to work with Democrats to reopen government. https://t.co/GvDpJ2IJbR
The House has a responsibility to pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen all of government. I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader to bring that to the Floor for a vote immediately so Congress can present @POTUS with a clear path to end this #TrumpShutdown, which he should sign.
Make no mistake: Democrats have done everything possible to prevent this #TrumpShutdown, offering multiple compromises, including one agreed to unanimously in the Senate. @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP rejected them all.
Tonight, @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republicans chose to end their House Majority the way they have governed over the past two years, rejecting bipartisan compromise and embracing extremism, to the detriment of our country. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/oMd320EKN6
.@realDonaldTrump’s use of a government shutdown as a lever is bad for government; bad for the country; &amp; bad for our respect around the world. This #TrumpShutdown should not happen. Watch my discussion with @wolfblitzer on the need to keep government open. https://t.co/Xi8JolBfim
Actions have consequences. It’s unacceptable that @POTUS &amp; Congressional Republicans are willing to shut down the government &amp; force thousands of federal employees to go without pay just days before Christmas. America’s civil servants deserve better.  https://t.co/JiRSRofSgy
.@realDonaldTrump, you said you would be “proud” to shut down the government. You own this. Instead of throwing a tantrum over a single issue, agree to sign the bipartisan Senate-passed funding bill and let’s keep the government open. https://t.co/XfcSfxpery
This afternoon, I joined @VelshiRuhle to discuss how irrational &amp; reckless it is for @POTUS to cause a #TrumpShutdown. Dems are prepared to work w Republicans to keep the government open. @HouseGOP should pass the Senate-passed funding bill &amp; @realDonaldTrump ought to sign it. https://t.co/aURf8QcxHX
Who’s gonna tell him? https://t.co/XYY26oaGwT
.@realDonaldTrump, let me remind you the American people do not want a #TrumpShutdown. And here’s a recent @NPR poll to prove it: https://t.co/tWj7KfBqQ4
Must-read thread from @AmProg on the need to reappoint Commissioner @ChaiFeldblum to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. @SenMikeLee’s decision to block her re-appointment is unacceptable &amp; runs counter to our nation’s values. https://t.co/Toce1RkSu2
.@POTUS has demonstrated almost daily since being inaugurated impulsive, erratic, &amp; crisis-creating conduct, which has undermined the trust &amp; respect of our allies, the stability of the economy, &amp; the image of America as a stable &amp; reliable leader.
The principled resignation of Secretary Mattis is stark evidence of the dangerous and irresponsible defense and foreign policies being pursued by @RealDonaldTrump. https://t.co/6VMRFyuicm
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and Ranking Member on @HouseJudDems’ Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, @RepZoeLofgren.
Today on the Floor, the House will consider 21 non-controversial bills. Democrats stand ready to vote for the bipartisan Senate-passed funding bill to prevent a #TrumpShutdown. I continue to urge @HouseGOP to allow a vote &amp; @realDonaldTrump to sign it. https://t.co/f5m2sqMz0w
If we have one duty when we come to Congress, it is to have our government function effectively for our people.  Republicans failed to meet that responsibility tonight.  RT if you agree. #TrumpShutdown
I spoke on the Floor on Republicans’ failure to do their job and responsibly fund government. Instead of working with Democrats to prevent a #TrumpShutdown, @HouseGOP is pandering to @RealDonaldTrump by holding government funding hostage to his costly, ineffective border wall. https://t.co/IE0hEf2tHl
I want to thank incoming @HouseJudDems Chair @RepJerryNadler, incoming @HouseDemocrats Chair @RepJeffries, and all the Members who worked hard to bring this legislation to the Floor and ensure that it passed with bipartisan support.
Today, both parties came together to pass long overdue criminal justice reform. After the #FirstStepAct, Congress must build on these reforms to ensure that our justice system treats every person equitably &amp; makes our country both safer &amp; fairer. https://t.co/3kpuVCABXx
What is happening in the House right now is a continuation of the dysfunction and deep division we have seen from the President and Congressional Republicans. They are failing to act responsibly to make sure our government is funded and serving our people. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/4OuNeT7qJA
This is deeply disrespectful &amp; stunningly short-sighted, @RepMarkMeadows, &amp; I’m sure the more than 6,000 federal employees in your district beg to differ. Civil servants work day-in &amp; day-out on behalf of the American people. They didn't sign up for a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/NDvyrYCbVi

Today’s announcement from @BLMNational is a reckless effort to develop the fragile coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. I continue to stand with the Gwich’in people &amp; tribal communities harmed by the Trump Admin’s blatant disregard for sacred lands. #ProtectTheArtic https://t.co/Nk9pTi4ZJe
I urge Republicans and @realDonaldTrump to act with maturity and allow a clean funding bill to move forward now to prevent a dangerous and unnecessary #TrumpShutdown over Christmas.
With the GOP still in full control of both Congress &amp; the White House, there can be no doubt who will be held responsible if they shut down a large part of the govt in order to facilitate a temper tantrum by POTUS over a border wall he promised taxpayers would not have to pay.
.@POTUS and @HouseGOP are needlessly moving the country closer to a #TrumpShutdown for which President Trump only last week declared he would be proudly responsible. https://t.co/JXfCpIPWbT
As we all wait for @HouseGOP to meet with @realDonaldTrump, here’s a reminder of who wants to shut down the government over a costly, ineffective border wall. #TrumpShutdown #ThrowbackThursday https://t.co/56VYw4oZZq
Today, the House will consider 35 non-controversial bills, including a criminal justice reform bill, the #FirstStepAct. We must also fund the government. I hope House GOP leaders will bring legislation to the Floor to prevent a #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/NEyipgl6Hb
Joined @chelliepingree in introducing legislation to block the proposed reorganization &amp; relocation of @USDA agencies outside of the Washington, DC area. The move would be extremely disruptive to the mission of USDA and impact hundreds of federal workers. https://t.co/Hnas1JLTRM
Congressional Republicans are once again kicking the can down the road with a short-term funding bill, instead of responsibly funding government for the remainder of the fiscal year. Watch my discussion on @NewDay on government funding &amp; @POTUS’ dangerous decision on #Syria. https://t.co/GV4YpU4Ilv
I will continue working with @RepEliotEngel of @HFACDemocrats &amp; @RepAdamSmith of @HASCDemocrats to ensure that this Administration has fully evaluated &amp; understands the consequences of its actions in Syria.  The Congress must be fully briefed on any new developments.
I am troubled by @POTUS’ seemingly sudden &amp; poorly thought-out decision to withdraw American forces from #Syria when serious issues remain unresolved. He needs to explain to Congress &amp; the American people what exactly is involved in this withdrawal.  https://t.co/TfJZc4RRKf
Joined @TeamCavuto to discuss how Republicans—who control all levers of govt—are once again kicking the can down the road with another short-term funding bill and holding government funding hostage. It’s unfortunate they are just delaying this issue. https://t.co/Cyx8m9NZIq
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider twelve non-controversial bills.  https://t.co/EKsoUbqw8S
I agree with Ranking Member @BobbyScott that the Trump Admin’s school safety report is not a serious effort to make students safer. We have an obligation to keep students safe from #GunViolence and protect their civil rights. The recommendations in this report do neither. https://t.co/TB0gSCmKhV
These is bipartisan consensus on funding 97% of government, but that’s being held hostage by one issue: the President’s costly, ineffective, &amp; unpopular border wall. Read more here: https://t.co/vi5rWAeHPx
I also said to reporters today that I was pleased to see the Senate pass the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, the #FirstStepAct. I hope the House can take action on this important legislation this week.
I also told reporters today that I disagree with the federal judge in Texas who ruled the #ACA unconstitutional. Next Congress, Democrats will act to ensure the House as a body will join the court case in defense of the ACA &amp; its protections for people with pre-ex conditions.
Today, I told reporters discussions are ongoing in the Senate over a short-term CR to prevent a #TrumpShutdown, but continuing to punt on appropriations is a failure on the part of Republicans, who control the House, Senate, &amp; White House to get our work done on time.
Congrats to Mount Harmony Elementary School in Calvert County for being recognized as a Maryland Blue Ribbon School for the 2018-2019 school year. https://t.co/7E42amO6zR
Great to stop by the Maryland State &amp; D.C. AFL-CIO executive board meeting in Baltimore today to express my strong support for labor and working families in our state.

Glad to visit Arundel Judy Center today to learn more about the support the facility is providing to hundreds of families in South Baltimore.

The humanitarian catastrophe in #Yemen cries out for immediate action. If the current GOP Majority fails to act this year, as Majority Leader, I will work with @RepEliotEngel, @RepAdamSmith, &amp; @RepRoKhanna to bring war powers legislation to the Floor.
We must make clear that the House stands with the Senate in demanding a change in policy and that the Administration must stand up for basic American values.
Today, I sent a letter to @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader calling for immediate consideration of Senate-passed resolutions to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led campaign in #Yemen &amp; hold the Saudi Crown Prince responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. https://t.co/amMoqaH4j7 https://t.co/ZAOA2js7Sx

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HomelandDems’ Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, @RepDonaldPayne.
.@SecretaryZinke’s departure is long overdue. At @Interior, he abused taxpayer funding while attacking public lands, water, &amp; wildlife he was charged with protecting. I encourage @POTUS to appoint a Secretary who will protect — not undermine — our nation’s natural resources.
.@POTUS’ choice of @MickMulvaneyOMB as acting Chief of Staff is a deeply troubling indication that he is choosing confrontation over compromise. He is not someone who is going to get us to the kind of agreement we need to keep government open &amp; working. https://t.co/pQLXFhiVBC
The ruling on the #ACA represents @HouseGOP’s latest effort in their onslaught against access to quality, affordable health coverage. In January the House Dem Majority will act to defend Americans’ access to affordable health care. https://t.co/TeUS8ZOJyh

6 years after 20 children &amp; 6 educators were senselessly killed at #SandyHook Elementary, it is unacceptable that Congress has done nothing to #EndGunViolence.

Happy birthday to my friend and Co-Chair of @HouseDemocrats’ Rebuilding America Task Force, @DonaldNorcross.
I asked @GOPLeader today on the Floor: what is the @HouseGOP plan to fund the government? Democrats have put forward two compromise offers to keep government open. Will Republicans agree on what we agree on, or are they going to shut down government like @realDonaldTrump wants? https://t.co/rMKVLKNo7x
Wishing a happy birthday to @RepAnnaEshoo.
Today on the Floor, the House is only voting on one noncontroversial bill – and @HouseGOP still doesn’t have a plan to keep government open &amp; prevent another #TrumpShutdown ahead of the December 21 deadline. https://t.co/uBJ8n810he

I encourage @POTUS to sign this bill into law immediately to provide policy certainty to an agricultural sector already reeling from the loss of export markets in response to the Trump Administration’s trade policies.

As we remember him and honor his memory, we must work together to prevent these senseless acts of violence and spread tolerance and respect throughout our communities.
Richie was a talented young man, and we continue to mourn with his family that his life was tragically cut short by an act of prejudice.

Instead of building on the Clean Water Act’s protections, the Trump Administration is proposing a #DirtyWaterRule to weaken them, putting corporate polluters ahead of public health and access to clean water for our families. #ProtectCleanWater https://t.co/aW6Twnly9T
I also mentioned that Republicans are once again attempting to bring yet another #GOPTaxScam bill to the Floor without a single hearing. I will urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation that will add $80 billion to the deficit.
In addition to funding the government, Republicans ought to ensure we reauthorize #VAWA, the National Flood Insurance Program, and the Land &amp; Water Conservation fund.
I also said to reporters this morning that GOP controls the House, Senate, &amp; White House. It is their responsibility to keep govt open. Dems are for border security, but we do not support border wall funding. We should pass the bills on which we agree &amp; a full-year CR for DHS.
Today, I started my weekly press conference by commending @TIME on their decision to honor journalists and truthseekers, including the brave journalists at @CapGazNews. Thank you to journalists everywhere for your role in safeguarding our democracy. #TIMEPOY

Once again, wage growth failed to break out, making it even harder for these hard working Americans to make ends meet, save for a secure retirement, and dig out from under mountains of student loan debt. With a Dem majority, these concerns will be foremost on our agenda.
While reflective of a resilient economy, the November #JobsReport was weaker than expected, driven in part by uncertainty due to trade and the realization that any short term benefit of the #GOPTaxScam has already worn off. https://t.co/v3DnVzIPYJ

As the President and Congressional leaders negotiate funding for border security, Democrats believe there should be significant changes to the President’s cruel immigration policies paired with that funding.
As year-end spending negotiations continue, House Dems continue to stand firm against @POTUS's border wall. We support strong border security, but we must balance that with protecting the dignity of immigrants &amp; asylum seekers &amp; minimizing harmful impacts to border communities.

This morning I told reporters President George H.W. Bush is the quintessential example of what those of us in public service ought to be. He respected our institutions, practiced civility, expected courtesy and gave it to others. #Remembering41

I’m proud to join the incoming Democratic Leadership team for the 116th Congress as Majority Leader-elect. I look forward to serving the Caucus and working with my colleagues to deliver results for the American people. https://t.co/h3iGxXPlrP
I urge @POTUS to look at the results of the election &amp; reconsider undermining the ACA. When Dems assume the Majority, we will focus on ways to bring health care costs down &amp; protect those w pre-ex conditions, no matter how hard this President &amp; his allies try to do the opposite.
These actions will result in fewer Americans receiving comprehensive health coverage, more consumers with junk plans that provide insufficient coverage, and a fragmented health care market that imposes higher costs on patients and their families.
After being sharply rebuked for their attempts to sabotage the #ACA, @POTUS &amp; the GOP are doubling down on efforts to dismantle the law by directly contradicting the language &amp; intent of the ACA &amp; diluting the impact of the law’s cost-saving subsidies. https://t.co/PDGsmOPjhF
Recent hate-motivated events, including the shooting in PA, demonstrate how the dangerous rise of white nationalism &amp; anti-Semitism is a threat to all Americans &amp; our democracy. I join @bend_thearc in unequivocally rejecting white nationalism in all forms. #RejectWhiteNationalism

Russia’s actions in the Azov Sea are another example of unacceptable brute force &amp; aggression. In the next Congress, I will work with my colleagues in the House to bring to the Floor legislation that holds Russia accountable for this type of aggression.
I hope the Admin will finally answer our letter &amp; quickly schedule a House briefing on U.S. policy toward Yemen &amp; U.S.-Saudi relations in light of the brutal murder of Jamal #Khashoggi. Members deserve to be fully informed &amp; require the same briefing given to Senators.
On August 14, I joined @RepEliotEngel, @RepAdamSmith, &amp; @RepRoKhanna on a letter requesting that the House receive a briefing on the situation in #Yemen &amp; American involvement. House Members need information to conduct their constitutional duties. https://t.co/8kNSxiHEeJ

In addition to Mr. Whitaker’s appointment being unconstitutional, he is wholly unqualified, having made past statements contradicting principles of judicial independence &amp; having prejudged the outcome of the special counsel’s investigation he is now tasked with overseeing.
The Constitution provides the Senate with a responsibility to advise and consent, a fundamental component of our system of checks and balances.  The appointment of an unconfirmed official to serve as acting Attorney General runs counter to this principle.  https://t.co/WQDiRM8rqD

Congress has a responsibility to hold the Trump Admin accountable for its mismanagement, &amp; tomorrow’s @VetAffairsDems hearing is an important step.  The Admin must fix this problem &amp; ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they have earned.
It is appalling that veterans have been made to wait for months to receive GI Bill benefits, with some even forced to move out of their homes or face bankruptcy.  This is an unnecessary &amp; preventable crisis, &amp; @DeptVetAffairs must take immediate action. https://t.co/EHeiE0DZLF

Instead of using executive actions to deny refuge to those fleeing horrendous violence and domestic abuse, @POTUS ought to work with Congress to achieve the kind of bipartisan, comprehensive reforms needed to fix our broken immigration &amp; asylum system.
Today’s immigration announcement is yet another indicator of @POTUS’ inhumane &amp; ill-conceived asylum policies. Imposing illegal restrictions on refugees seeking asylum runs counter to our nation’s principles &amp; represents an overreach of presidential power. https://t.co/6ziNnvHSr6

It isn't enough to look at how many jobs our economy creates.  What matters is what those jobs bring to our people. Will we build an economy that works #ForthePeople once more, where a career opens doors to a more secure future?  That's what House Dems are ready to achieve.
In the last #JobsReport before the midterm election, Americans can see the fundamental challenges facing our economy. As wage growth slowed to its lowest level since February, it’s clear the jobs aren't always paying the higher wages our workers deserve.  https://t.co/S5Uia7iPML

.@RealDonaldTrump’s suggestion that Americans need to worship under armed guard is absurd. We must address the ease by which someone can obtain the most dangerous weapons of war and use them to commit mass violence in this country.
I would hope @POTUS &amp; others who have sought to divide our country by race &amp; faith would apologize for doing so &amp; make it absolutely clear that such words have no place in our national life.
As a nation, we need to confront the truth that words have consequences. The fact that we have seen a rise in hate-fueled violence in conjunction with the use of anti-Semitic and other racist rhetoric in our politics cannot be ignored.
I am horrified by today’s shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in #Pittsburgh. I am praying for the victims &amp; their families &amp; the first responders at the scene. https://t.co/l0QILkAxTg

If @POTUS refuses to stand up to Saudi Arabia, it is incumbent upon Congress to take a stand to not only defend U.S. values, but to send a strong signal of support to journalists and democracy activists everywhere.
Given the reports surrounding Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia ought to be carefully scrutinized, as should any possible sale of U.S. weapons to Saudi Arabia.
The reported death of Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi officials is appalling, as is the Trump Admin’s failure to hold the government of Saudi Arabia accountable for its actions. https://t.co/IBn73bt6Rb

.@SpeakerRyan &amp; other GOP leaders have made it crystal clear that Republicans intend to make up the budget shortfall by cutting from Social Security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid.  Americans should take the GOP at their word - &amp; take Dems at ours that we’ll fight to stop it.
Today’s report from the Trump Admin that the federal deficit rose 17% to reach $779 billion in FY 18 is the direct result of a GOP-led Congress &amp; @WhiteHouse choosing to provide massive tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans in the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/eYS2hVNrcy
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepBonamici. Thank you for your commitment to students and educators in #OR01 &amp; across the country as Vice Ranking Member on @edworkforcedems.
On International #DayoftheGirl we recognize the importance of empowering women &amp; girls across the globe. I thank @HouseDemWomen for their efforts to fight for #EqualPay, paid family leave, &amp; affordable health care. We’ll continue to work together to advance these policies.
Today, as we celebrate the courage of #LGBT individuals on #NationalComingOutDay, let us also recommit ourselves to the fight for LGBT equality. I will continue to work with the @LGBTEqCaucus to combat discriminatory policies &amp; advance equality.
The disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi is deeply alarming. I strongly urge @POTUS to push Saudi officials for answers regarding Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. Violence against the press cannot be accepted anywhere in the world. https://t.co/Ni6oDWj33H
.@POTUS’ op-ed is a desperate attempt to forestall a huge electoral loss, which will not work. Americans know the GOP has been relentless in sabotaging our health care system. They know Dems are offering a real chance to help working families get ahead. https://t.co/gfCe4KGXDD
Happy birthday to my friend, @RepMcEachin. I enjoyed visiting Richmond on Monday &amp; touring a local small business, Shockoe Atelier, with you. Thank you for your commitment to ensuring small businesses have the tools to #MakeItInAmerica and succeed in a 21st century economy.
Democrats in the House of Representatives are overwhelmingly committed to the security of and partnership with our ally, Israel. That will never change.
Great to join @RepMcEachin and hear from the founders of @shockoe_atelier about how Congress can respond to the challenges they face in today’s economy. The #MakeItInAmerica plan we’re leading aims to strengthen entrepreneurship &amp; help businesses get ahead. https://t.co/NcGnJyYlXg
Yesterday, I was pleased to join @RepMcEachin for a tour of @shockoe_atelier denim, a small business in Richmond, VA. We discussed how Congress can support small businesses like Shockoe Atelier &amp; ensure they can continue to #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/PEW6CT9qpi
Today is the one-year anniversary of the #ToxicTrump Admin’s decision to gut the Clean Power Plan, placing the profits of large corporations over public health. Democrats will continue to advocate #ForthePeople &amp; work to ensure our communities have access to clean air &amp; water. https://t.co/xm4TXDzthB
Next Monday is the last day to submit your app for the 2018 Congressional App Challenge. All interested #MD05 students should visit https://t.co/cv9CH8MdbO to learn more. https://t.co/XYSdQYAaBj
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former Senator Joseph Tydings, a proud Marylander, a good friend, and a fellow Terp. His family and friends are in my prayers as we remember a great statesman who served our state and nation with courage and convinction.
Honored to join the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service &amp; give thanks for the sacrifices of fallen heroes in Emmitsburg. As we remember them, let us recommit to keeping firefighters safe &amp; supporting their families when the unimaginable occurs. https://t.co/d5j1BrCVNo https://t.co/HXMp0rMoF3
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and physicist, @RepBillFoster. Thank you for your work to advocate on behalf of consumers and working families on @FSCDems and commitment to the sciences and #STEM fields and research.
The confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the result of a partisan, hypocritical process the GOP implemented to achieve their political ends at the expense of an independent &amp; impartial #SCOTUS. Republicans should be ashamed. https://t.co/W41id30gpW
Honored to receive @PGChamber1's Trailblazer of the Year award last night. I'm proud of the work we’ve done together over the years to grow our economy and make our County a great place to live and work. https://t.co/KqqHZ8hrkE
Pleased to meet with @pgccnews leadership to discuss House Democrats’ #MakeItInAmerica agenda &amp; learn about the @TeamBuildersTBA, which matches students with local employers &amp; ensures students have the skills they need to get ahead and succeed in their careers. https://t.co/SDEqsKnvSy
Enjoyed spending #ManufacturingDay touring &amp; hearing from employees of @ThompsonCreek Windows Manufacturing Facility this afternoon. Pleased to see how Thompson Creek is creating good jobs in #MD05 &amp; ensuring employees have the training &amp; skills to #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/LH3hzNghcM
Beyond the unemployment rate, the Admin &amp; Congressional GOP’s policies are making it harder for workers &amp; entrepreneurs to #MakeItInAmerica. House Dems have a plan to change that by investing in infrastructure &amp; skills training &amp; making it easier to launch new businesses.
As wages continue to stagnate, the economic expansion of the last several years has still not been fully felt by workers. Rather than focus on helping all Americans get ahead, Republicans chose to gamble once again on the #GOPTaxScam &amp; sabotage the health care system.
We should all be encouraged by today’s #JobsReport that our economy added 134,000 jobs in September. However, the American people understand that there remain problems hiding beneath these numbers.  https://t.co/f7eNW4CNSY
I have met with individuals here under #TPS &amp; want to thank @CASAforall for its hard work on their behalf. I will continue to monitor this closely &amp; work with my colleagues in the @HispanicCaucus &amp; @OfficialCBC on a long-term legislative solution that keeps families together.
Yesterday’s court ruling was a relief in the short term for refugees w #TPS, but Congress must still provide a long-term legislative solution. Those who came here escaping disasters or instability &amp; were given refuge are now living in fear of deportation. https://t.co/fovbCbFDvD
Republicans should admit that they no longer care whether an individual has the temperament or the impartiality that should be the hallmark of a Supreme Court Justice. It is clear that achieving their political ends is their sole objective. #RejectKavanaugh
Today has exposed what a sham this #SCOTUS confirmation process is. The fact that the FBI “investigation” failed to interview either principal undermines the notion that it was thorough or serious. The hypocrisy of GOP leaders is almost incomprehensible. https://t.co/ubsUFIAf1d
Happy birthday to my good friend &amp; a powerful voice for social justice in the House, @RepJoeKennedy. Thank you for your leadership as Chair of the @LGBTEqCaucus’ Transgender Equality Task Force &amp; commitment to ensuring access to affordable, quality mental health care for all.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepKarenBass. Thank you for your leadership &amp; commitment to improving the child welfare system as founder of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. I enjoy joining you for the #FosterYouthVoices day every year.
It is incumbent upon @POTUS &amp; @SecNielsen to follow the laws &amp; the directives of our courts to #ReuniteEveryChild.  I appreciate the @HispanicCaucus’ leadership on this issue &amp; its Members’ requests to obtain answers on what the Admin is doing to remedy this crisis.
These children were, frankly, treated like animals in pens, a tragic chapter in the history of our country that will not be forgotten by future generations who will look back on it with shame.
The @DHSgov IG report reveals an Admin placing politics ahead of children’s well-being. It is unconscionable that the Admin violated federal law by detaining children in holding pens for more than 3 days. https://t.co/HfGVpcpLl9 #FamiliesBelongTogether
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseJudDems’ Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet, @RepHankJohnson.
For the past 2 years, GOP and Trump Admin have repeatedly attacked the federal civilian workforce by undermining pay and benefits. I’m proud to stand together with NARFE members to fight against efforts to demean the service of civilian federal employees.
Pleased to meet with MD chapter of @NARFEHQ to express my gratitude for their service &amp; discuss some of the most pressing issues facing federal employees. https://t.co/GoiftmPfoT https://t.co/jv0biBjVA2
It is unacceptable that Republicans are sabotaging Americans' health care. @OversightDems' report underscores the serious impact of their actions – over 3 million Marylanders, including 28,000 people in #MD05, are at risk of losing coverage as a result. https://t.co/kK0XhEdgse
Deeply disappointed by the Admin’s decision to effectively deny U.S. visas for same-sex partners of diplomats &amp; @UN officials. This @StateDept policy adds undue hardship on couples from countries that criminalize gay marriage &amp; should be reversed. https://t.co/vyuMQRPm1b
Wishing a happy 60th birthday to @NASA! I'm proud to represent the hard working federal employees at @NASAGoddard in #MD05 and will continue to advocate on their behalf in Congress to ensure they have resources necessary to complete their missions. #NASA60th
I’m pleased that the Institute has been awarded $2 million through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program over the past 4 years to purchase new equipment to train fire fighters and emergency services personnel.
Great to visit @MFRI_UMD with Chief Barksdale this afternoon to tour the facility &amp; meet with firefighters to thank them for the work they do each day to protect our communities. https://t.co/EfUdsnXvGE https://t.co/zhQEE4f5zz
As I reflect on this shooting &amp; many others, I am angered that Congress has failed to do its job &amp; keep the American people safe. Congress must get back to the work of protecting Americans by banning assault weapons &amp; bump stocks &amp; expanding background checks. #VegasStrong
On #1October, our nation experienced the worst mass shooting in its history, w 58 people killed &amp; over 400 wounded. We remember the victims &amp; mourn w their families, &amp; we keep in our hearts the survivors as they continue to cope with the scars of that day. https://t.co/9HPbBUMpOQ
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and a strong advocate for working families in #CA20, @RepJimmyPanetta. Thank you for working with me to ensure more families can make it in America, including joining me on the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour.
Happy birthday to my good friend and Senior Whip, @RepGraceMeng. Thank you for your work leadership as founder and Co-Chair of the Kids’ Safety Caucus.
Read my statement on the updated #NAFTA agreement announced by the Trump Administration: https://t.co/wJZLdiY7YS https://t.co/Ibla7OktY2
Congress and the public must be reassured that such a dramatic shift in direction for this project is based on full and accurate information rather than simply to benefit the President’s financial interest.
It is incredibly alarming that the revised plan suddenly proposed keeping the new FBI headquarters at the Pennsylvania Avenue location when the FBI and @USGSA had consistently stated that the Hoover Building was not adequate to meet the FBI’s security and operational needs.
Joined colleagues in sending a letter to @JusticeOIG requesting an investigation into the decision-making process for the consolidated @FBI HQ project. https://t.co/6AhbVWpQMx https://t.co/Uh1c3lPuFw
There is much more to be done to address the opioid epidemic. We need to ↑ funding for treatment &amp; expand coverage for those w substance abuse disorders. Our opioid challenge demands a bipartisan commitment &amp; partnership between govt, law enforcement, providers, &amp; advocates.
Pleased that Democrats &amp; Republicans were able to come together today to pass legislation to address our nation’s opioid crisis. The bill passed today makes small but important improvements in the fight against the overuse &amp; abuse of addictive opioids. https://t.co/XmsG2hiWNL
The #GOPTaxScam bill was wrong the first time around last December, and the #GOPTaxScam 2.0 wrong again now.
Republicans are doubling down on tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class w the #GOPTaxScam 2.0. Their bill will add $3.2T to the deficit over the first ten years it takes effect, putting our children &amp; grandchildren further into debt. https://t.co/Z7TAPVDj5f
House Republicans just voted to explode the deficit even more to give another round of tax cuts to the wealthy. RT if you agree the @HouseGOP is fiscally reckless. https://t.co/e2zVgbb5Cp https://t.co/XrgPcJOURu
Republicans are already using the #GOPTaxScam as an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  Now, they’re doubling down &amp; adding another $3.2 trillion to the deficit once their tax scam 2.0 is implemented, further jeopardizing these important programs. https://t.co/ubmFGl7AOH
The #GOPTaxScam 2.0 is more of the same from @HouseGOP: same rushed process; same impact that benefits the wealthiest Americans, leaves the middle class behind, &amp; explodes the deficit. Read more about the bill here: https://t.co/e2zVgbb5Cp https://t.co/lPqjhK121w
The #GOPTaxScam added trillions to the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthiest &amp; corporations. Now, @HouseGOP is attempting to jam through another bill that explodes the deficit &amp; sticks our children w the bill. RT if you oppose the #GOPTaxScam 2.0 https://t.co/e2zVgbb5Cp https://t.co/sdAdFfkvdi
Today, @HouseGOP is doubling down on their tax cuts for the wealthy by voting on #GOPTaxScam 2.0. Dems will oppose this giveaway to the 1% that leaves the middle class behind, explodes the deficit, &amp; puts Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; Social Security at risk. https://t.co/ZAJ0yce8HB
After years of railing about deficits, @HouseGOP is doubling down on their deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam with a second tax cut for the wealthy that adds trillions to the deficit &amp; puts Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; Social Security at risk. https://t.co/e2zVgbb5Cp https://t.co/qxIZwwmF5g
I am proud of the @HouseDemWomen walking to the Senate to stand in support of Dr. Ford this morning. #BelieveWomen https://t.co/GwNjRfqAot

This morning, Republicans are doubling down on their flawed #GOPTaxScam with another bill that gives enormous tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class and the deficit. Read more here about the #GOPTaxScam 2.0: https://t.co/e2zVgbb5Cp https://t.co/sesvp8uzW2
Joined @RepTerriSewell &amp; @GKButterfield to hear from @USCCRgov officials on their report on the state of minority #VotingRights. When a single American is turned away from a polling place, that erodes the power of every vote cast. That is why we must #RestoretheVOTE. https://t.co/dltsI3Ey5U
Today on the Floor, House Republicans will begin consideration of three tax bills, an attempt to cover up the fact that their #GOPTaxScam overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest and leaves the middle class behind while exploding the deficit. https://t.co/h4UmvB0Ga7
I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. She is courageous &amp; compelling. We owe it to her, to those who have been subjected to such pain and trauma, and to our country to fully investigate all the allegations. There should not be a vote before that happens.
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend, a Chief Deputy Whip, and a strong advocate for expanding access to affordable, quality health care, @RepDWStweets.
Happy birthday to my good friend &amp; @HispanicCaucus Freshman Representative, @RepEspaillat. Thank you for continually raising your voice on behalf of #OurFellowAmericans rebuilding in #PuertoRico &amp; work to #ReuniteEveryChild.
When the GOP undermines our federal civilian workforce, they make it more difficult for our govt to function efficiently &amp; provide Americans with the services they expect. My colleagues &amp; I are committed to working to ensure fair pay and workplace protections for fed employees.
Appreciated the opportunity to lead the National Capital Region Delegation in meeting with reps from federal employee unions to discuss the significant harm that continued attacks by @POTUS and Congressional Republicans have on federal civilian workforce. https://t.co/jqhpIbKenI https://t.co/VeXZj1XgZw
I encourage all to read this powerful op-ed by my good friend, @RepAnnieKuster. Thank you for sharing your powerful story and lending your voice to this important discussion. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/P2S4IovAt7
Today, the House passed legislation to fund our military, safeguard our nation’s health, educate our people, &amp; protect workers. It will also ensure other agencies remain open through 12/7. It is now @POTUS’ responsibility to sign it &amp; keep the govt open. https://t.co/p1EvfeEhbq

Since traveling to #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria, I have advocated for changes to the Stafford Act that will allow communities to rebuild stronger after natural disasters.

I will continue to work with #MOAA to promote military installations in #MD05 &amp; support service members, veterans, &amp; their families. https://t.co/PkeLWxPWze
In addition, the House will vote on a reauthorization of @FAANews, which includes disaster relief funds for North &amp; South Carolina as well as changes to the Stafford Act that I advocated for to ensure #OurFellowAmericans can rebuild to 21st century standards following disasters.
Today on the Floor, the House will consider 18 bills including Appropriations for Departments of Defense, Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, &amp; Education for #FY19 &amp; a Continuing Resolution to keep much of government open through Dec 7. https://t.co/A2y3VjXcji

On #NationalVoterRegistrationDay, I applaud the work of voter registration organizations. I also thank @RepJohnLewis for dedicating his life to voting rights, @RepBrady for his bill to make voter registration automatic, &amp; @RepTerriSewell for her leadership to #RestoreTheVote.
The right to vote is the foundation of our system of government &amp; on #NationalVoterRegistrationDay I urge everyone to #RegisterToVote &amp; make a plan to head to the polls on 11/6. Government that works #ForthePeople requires broad participation by all. https://t.co/6QMR2ID4Ww https://t.co/Cs6zDabSl8
Happy birthday to my good friend and Ranking Member on @HFACDemocrats’ Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats, @RepGregoryMeeks.
While @HouseGOP pursues #GOPTaxScam 2.0, Democrats are focused on policies #ForthePeople, including lowering health care costs &amp; prescription drug costs, raising wages, &amp; cleaning up Republicans’ culture of corruption.
5. The American people know this bill is more of the same failed policies from Republicans that cut taxes for those at the top at the expense of the middle class.
4. We also know – because the @WhiteHouse &amp; Congressional GOP have said so on the record – that they plan to cut earned benefits such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare after adding trillions to the deficit with the tax bills.
3. We know it’s a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. 1st #GOPTaxScam gave 83% of the benefits to the top 1% &amp; raised taxes for 86M middle-class households. By making tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; pass thru biz permanent, they are doing little to change that.
2. We know the #GOPTaxScam 2.0 would worsen the already massive budget shortfalls caused by the first round of tax cuts, which added $1.8 trillion to the deficit to give tax cuts to the wealthiest and corporations.
1. We know the GOP broke their promises to the American people with the first #GOPTaxScam including the false claim of a $4,000 wage increase; that the benefits would not favor the 1%; &amp; that it would pay for itself in economic growth. https://t.co/LXcd7YQin6
This week, the @HouseGOP is doubling down on their deeply unpopular tax law by bringing #GOPTaxScam 2.0, another tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, to the Floor for a vote. Here’s a look at what we know about the bill: https://t.co/e2zVgbb5Cp
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @DorisMatsui. Thank you for your leadership on @EnergyCommerce to advocate for access to affordable, quality health care for all in #CA06 &amp; across the country.
A few years ago, I visited Douglas Point in #MD05 with then-Interior Secretary Jewell to raise awareness about the critical role the LWCF plays in protecting our national parks. It’s deeply disappointing GOP is playing politics with the #LWCF once again. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/uisBfr3xGJ
Once again, @HouseGOP is close to allowing the Land and Water Conservation Fund expire. This fund protects our nation’s #PublicLands with no cost to American taxpayers. RT if you agree it’s time for Republicans to take action &amp; #SaveLWCF https://t.co/h31XW1CTld
I also said to press that @HouseGOP is continuing to pursue extraordinary fiscal irresponsibility with their attempt to jam their #GOPTaxScam 2.0 through the House, which benefits the wealthy over the middle class and will add trillions to the deficit.
I also told reporters that I am pleased the FAA reauthorization on the Floor includes disaster relief $ following #HurricaneFlorence as well as changes to the Stafford Act that I advocated for to ensure that communities affected by disasters can rebuild stronger than before.
At my weekly press conference, I told reporters Dems will support a bipartisan government funding bill on the Floor this week. Once the bill passes, I hope the President signs it into law before Friday and does not risk another irresponsible GOP government shutdown.
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider 38 bills. https://t.co/1rSwzmhoUW
Happy birthday to Ranking Member on @HouseSBCDems’ Subcommittee on Health and Technology, @RepAlLawson.
Happy birthday to my friend, Senior Whip, and First Vice Chair @USProgressives, @RepJayapal. Thank you for your leadership in the fight to #ReuniteEveryChild.
As we mark today's anniversary, we recognize the struggle for equality in the eyes of the military continues. I continue to fervently oppose @POTUS' harmful ban against transgender Americans serving in the military that undermines retention of our nation’s best &amp; brightest.
Today we mark 7 years since the end of the discriminatory 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy. Today, our military is stronger, more diverse, &amp; more reflective of our nation's values. I was proud to bring repeal of #DADT to the Floor as Majority Leader &amp; work to ensure its passage.

While the @WhiteHouse has said that @RealDonaldTrump ‘remains proud of all the work’ his Administration undertook in response to the storms, it is clear the billions of dollars Congress has appropriated to help communities rebuild is not getting to those most in need.
On the one-year anniversary of #HurricaneMaria making landfall &amp; wreaking havoc on the #USVI, #PuertoRico, &amp; Gulf Coast, we pause to recognize that many still struggle with basic necessities, such as clean water, reliable power, or a roof over their heads. https://t.co/4Z2KPd79JB https://t.co/v9WkLTHfxH

As #YomKippur begins this evening, I join in wishing all who observe a meaningful day of reflection and an easy fast.
By selectively declassifying documents relating to the investigation into his campaign’s possible collusion with Russia, @realDonaldTrump is once again showing he has no regard for the rule of law &amp; is putting his own interests ahead of the country’s. https://t.co/5aePgQ6udu
In 2016, I joined with the MD Delegation in requesting @EPA take action to reduce harmful emissions from power plants in upwind states. EPA’s rejection today of the petition is a dereliction of duty that fails to protect families in our state. https://t.co/SV4WFT2jzH
America was founded as a haven for those fleeing poverty, war, &amp; violence to find safety &amp; build a better life. The Admin’s decision to deny refugees asylum is an abdication of the principles that make our country great &amp; our democracy strong &amp; successful. https://t.co/cQGVc0pMsU
Happy birthday to my friend &amp; Chief Deputy Whip, @JoaquinCastrotx. Thank you for your leadership as @HispanicCaucus First Vice-Chair &amp; commitment to finding a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers.
What happened at Navy Yard was a tragic example of how our nation’s laws have failed to protect our people. I will continue to stand up &amp; fight for stronger laws to prevent a recurrence of what happened at Navy Yard &amp; so many places in our country before &amp; since. #NeverAgain
5 years ago, a gunman brought terror to Washington Navy Yard, killing 12 &amp; injuring 8 public servants. 3 of the victims were from #MD05: Sylvia Frasier, Kenneth Proctor, &amp; Frank Kohler.

As we continue to call for action to address these challenges, we also reflect this month on the proud history of Latinos and Latinas in this country and their contributions to America. #HispanicHeritageMonth
My colleagues in the @HispanicCaucus have been fighting hard for all of them, &amp; I will continue to partner with the CHC to demand that the Republican-led Congress not ignore these issues or fail to hold the Trump Admin accountable for its actions. #HispanicHeritageMonth
As we celebrate #HispanicHeritageMonth, let us keep in our hearts the children who remain in detention, #DREAMers living in uncertainty, &amp; #OurFellowAmericans in #PuertoRico, still struggling to rebuild even a year after devastating hurricanes. https://t.co/PASwOpE9MB

Thank you to @TheWilsonCenter for the recognition of this year’s Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service. I’m honored to share this year’s award with my good friend @RoyBlunt. https://t.co/Hw9ib9EGhF
American taxpayers want tax policies that make sense, that are fiscally sound, and that enable our nation to afford investments in opportunity and security for the future.  The #GOPTaxScam 2.0 does the opposite.
#GOPTaxScam is the perfect example of everything wrong with the GOP Congress, which has abjured regular order &amp; allowed a bad process to yield a bad product. Now, instead of working with Dems to fix the problems, the GOP are doubling-down &amp; trying to make a bad situation worse.
Today, @WaysandMeansGOP passed their #GOPTaxScam 2.0 out of committee on a party line vote. This bill would further bankrupt our children &amp; grandchildren to provide even more tax breaks to the wealthiest in our country. https://t.co/AsCUA047XM
I commend @RepEliotEngel @NitaLowey @RepSchneider @RepTedDeutch @RepVeasey for their work to ensure bipartisan passage. I hope it will send a strong message that the U.S. will never waver in its effort to end the scourge of anti-Semitism &amp; defend our ally #Israel.
I strongly support H.R. 1911, which would create an ambassadorial-level special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism. It is imperative that the United States leads in the effort to stamp out anti-Semitism both at home &amp; around the world. https://t.co/kqutiizCLL
Happy birthday to my friend and @OfficialCBC Chairman, @RepRichmond.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and vice chair of @USProgressives, @RepRoKhanna. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to job training &amp; economic development programs that support opportunities for working families to #MakeItInAmerica.
As we mark 24 years since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, we are reminded that #VAWA expires in four legislative days. I urge @HouseGOP to bring @JacksonLeeTX18’s bill to reauthorize #VAWA &amp; provide critical support for victims of domestic violence to the Floor.
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will vote to pass bipartisan funding bill for Energy &amp; Water Development, Military Construction &amp; Veterans Affairs, &amp; Legislative Branch Appropriations for FY19. https://t.co/9e9Gf8m9Ga
Only Donald Trump would try to make the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans into a story about himself and his political fortunes.  Shame on him, and shame on @HouseGOP for not holding him and his Administration accountable for their role in these tragic and preventable deaths. https://t.co/gBFZ8wQocA
These numbers show also us programs like Social Security &amp; nutrition assistance are invaluable in lifting families #OutOfPoverty. Congress should take the data to heart &amp; reinvest in proven anti-poverty programs to ensure all Americans have a chance to achieve the American dream.
In spite of positive topline indicators in the @uscensusbureau report, 39.7M Americans remain mired in poverty. Congress must do more to ensure that all families benefit from policies to help all Americans get ahead. Read my statement w @RepBarbaraLee: https://t.co/ur4qd6b9VY
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives is considering twenty-four bills. https://t.co/qExIeE3hzm
It is a reminder of why the GOP Congress’s abandonment of its oversight responsibilities is so alarming. When @POTUS fails to do his job, Congress ought to hold him accountable &amp; protect our democracy.  A vague executive order 2 months before Election Day is too little, too late.
After @POTUS took the word of Putin over our intel agencies &amp; called on Russia during the 2016 campaign to commit cyberattacks against our elections, today’s executive order won’t make anyone believe that he really cares about securing our elections. https://t.co/h9pJTtZFdK
Today, I delivered remarks at an event hosted by ECU Action Fund that focused on how a House Democratic Majority would renew Americans’ faith in government &amp; ensure it works #ForthePeople by passing a comprehensive govt reform package. Read my remarks: https://t.co/3DlzKx2zna https://t.co/8iahbZWxdq
I join in congratulating the new President of @PPFA, @DrLeanaWen.  Dr. Wen has done an outstanding job in Baltimore &amp; I look forward to working together to ensure Congress recognizes the organization’s important work to provide health care to Americans. https://t.co/msEiibJZNK
Under the Trump Admin &amp; dysfunction in the GOP Congress, many Americans believe their government is rigged against them. Here’s a look at Dem proposals to address these concerns &amp; return to a government of, by, &amp; #ForthePeople it serves: https://t.co/Bx8v22g0MC https://t.co/toXDGVotAU
This afternoon, I told reporters that the #GOPTaxScam 2.0 is another GOP bill that adds billions to the deficit &amp; proves the #GOPTaxScam is not working for Americans across the country.
In addition, I told reporters I am pleased to see a bipartisan minibus funding bill come to the Floor this week with appropriations for Military Construction, @DeptVetAffairs, @ENERGY, &amp; Legislative Branch.  I expect it will pass.
At my weekly press conference, I told reporters about a speech I delivered this morning on how a Democratic House Majority ought to take up a comprehensive government reform package in the opening days of the 116th Congress. Learn more here: https://t.co/3DlzKx2zna
Thank you to all who joined me at today’s speech &amp; to my host @StopBigMoney Action Fund for leadership on government reform &amp; push for a more responsive, representative, &amp; effective government #ForthePeople. https://t.co/E19ZegsDSt
The reforms I outlined today answer some of the challenges threatening our grand experiment in democracy.  Let us meet these challenges together with the resolve of our convictions and the energy of our ideals.  #ForthePeople
“Of the people, by the people, &amp; #ForthePeople.” In these three areas, Dems intend to put the tools of govt back in the hands of all Americans. To make our government responsive, representative, effective, &amp; transparent again for the people it serves.
One of the best ways to make govt work #ForthePeople is to improve the way Americans connect w their Congress &amp; agencies. I also partnered with GOP Leader to pass the bipartisan Modernizing Government Technology Act, which will facilitate major system upgrades. #ForThePeople
A bipartisan group, the Problem Solvers, led by @RepJoshG &amp; @RepTomReed, have proposed a number of changes to House rules, and I expect other Members will continue to do so between now and January.  #ForThePeople
We need to make sure that govt works better #ForthePeople it serves.  A Dem Majority would look to Members for new ideas on how to restore regular order &amp; make Congress work better. @RepMcGovern of the @RulesDemocrats is already soliciting proposals from Members. #ForThePeople https://t.co/EoJ9hft0GG
Let’s also strengthen the @OfficeGovEthics, as a bill introduced by @RepRaskin would do, in order to prevent &amp; resolve conflicts of interest in the executive branch.  We need cops on the beat with subpoena power and the ability to punish those who break the rules. #ForThePeople
One immediate change we can make to strengthen ethics standards in Congress is to ban House Members from serving on corporate boards. @RepKathleenRice has proposed this change, and I believe it will help prevent the appearance of conflicts of interest. #ForThePeople
To have a government “by the people” we also need to strengthen ethics standards for those serving in public office. There ought to be a requirement for full financial disclosure, including the most recent five years of tax returns, for the @POTUS &amp; @VP. #ForThePeople
Congressional districts will only be representative if the redistricting process is fair.  That’s why @RepZoeLofgren &amp; @repjimcooper have both been working on bills to promote national redistricting reform.  All our districts should be drawn fairly. #ForThePeople
.@RepThompson of @HomelandDems introduced the Election Security Act to impose higher standards for vendors &amp; to authorize funding for states to safeguard our elections from interference. #ForThePeople
Russia &amp; other foreign actors continue attempts to hack our voting systems and influence our elections.  Congress needs to get serious about election cybersecurity. When @RepMikeQuigley offered a motion to fund election security, every single Republican opposed it. #ForThePeople
In addition, we need to protect and strengthen @EACgov.  That means providing the Election Assistance Commission with the funding intended to help state and local officials employ best practices and protect the integrity of voting systems.  #ForThePeople
Ranking Member Robert Brady of the House Administration Committee has introduced legislation to make voter registration automatic across the country. It is every American citizen’s right to vote, and we ought to facilitate – not impede – that most basic of rights. #ForThePeople
Restoring the full power of the Voting Rights Act has to be the 1st step. That’s why I’ve partnered with @RepJohnLewis &amp; others to introduce the Voter Empowerment Act.  #ForThePeople
First and foremost, a new Democratic Majority will do what Congress should have done five years ago: restore and strengthen the #VRA. @RepTerriSewell, who represents #Selma, the site of the 1965 voting rights march, has already introduced legislation to do so. #ForThePeople
In addition to making govt more responsive, we need to make it more representative. Our govt ought to be led “by the people” it serves &amp; should be composed of public servants who reflect the diversity, experiences, &amp; highest ethical standards of the American people. #ForThePeople https://t.co/29mlVcPuZ2
There’s no accountability in Washington.  Under a Democratic House Majority, that would change.  A Dem House would conduct fair, honest, thorough oversight to investigate abuses &amp; hold officials accountable.  This will not – &amp; must not – be about playing politics. #ForThePeople
Over the past year &amp; a half, we’ve witnessed a parade of Admin officials caught abusing the public trust.  The corruption starts at the top, with @POTUS clearly benefiting from foreign governments currying favor by financially supporting Trump-family investments. #ForThePeople
When the Trump Administration ripped crying children from the arms of their parents at the border – and, incomprehensibly, did not maintain the necessary information to reunite them – this GOP Congress, shamefully, did not investigate. #FamiliesBelongTogether #ForThePeople
When hurricanes devastated #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI, the Admin botched its response. A report by @OversightDems concluded that the decision by GOP not to investigate &amp; to protect the Admin from criticism deprived Americans from an examination of the govt response. #ForThePeople
When the Trump Administration began sabotaging our health care system and putting millions of Americans’ access to health care in danger, the Republican Congress did nothing to stop it. In fact, it has been complicit in the effort.  #ForThePeople
The other area where we can make govt more responsive is restoring Congress’s role under our Constitution - conducting appropriate oversight of the executive branch.  On one issue after the other, this GOP-led Congress has abandoned oversight responsibilities. #ForThePeople
Building a fair election system – like @RepSarbanes’ Government by the People Act proposes – will ensure that candidates have the resources needed to get their messages out to voters while promoting greater civic engagement &amp; community representation. #ForThePeople
It’s time to get serious about creating a system of fair election financing. This is an issue on which @RepSarbanes has led the way. The money-chase shrinks the pool of good people willing to step up &amp; serve, takes time from legislating &amp; interacting w constituents. #ForThePeople
First, we need to require full disclosure from SuperPACs.  Let’s finally pass @RepCicilline’s DISCLOSE Act &amp; reveal their contributors.  We ought to also require a new 48 hour disclosure requirement for all contributions to independent expenditure organizations. #ForThePeople
The best way to turn back this onslaught is to overturn Citizens United.  @RepTedDeutch has taken the lead in introducing a constitutional amendment to do so &amp; it falls to the Congress to address the problems that ruling created by increasing transparency. #ForThePeople
First, our govt ought to reflect the values, ideals, &amp; aspirations of all Americans. It should be “of the people” it serves. We must take steps to make govt more responsive &amp; the most important thing we can do is remove the corrosive influence of money in politics. #ForThePeople https://t.co/y1oJEFpv4k
Government of the people, government by the people, and government for the people. In each of these three areas, Democrats aim to renew America’s democracy and restore our people’s faith in their government.  #ForThePeople
Americans need to be reminded how, when it works for the people, government can be a force for progress, justice, &amp; broadening opportunity.  If Dems can fix govt, we can earn the trust of voters to lead on addressing health care, infrastructure &amp; other challenges. #ForThePeople
My good friend @RepSarbanes has been a leader in the effort to ensure that the practice of American government lines up with its promise.  His “Government by the People Act” provides a perfect starting point for this effort.  I thank him for all his hard work. #ForThePeople
Today’s speech is about House Democrats’ commitment to restoring to the American people the assurance their government works for them.  It is about how, together, we can continue to keep this republic with which we have been entrusted.  #ForThePeople
Since then, under the Trump Admin &amp; a dysfunctional Congress, Americans have grown further estranged from their own democracy. People believe govt is rigged against them &amp; this belief undermines trust in govt &amp; impedes our ability to govern. This must be addressed. #ForThePeople
Two years ago in July 2016, I laid out several policy prescriptions for renewing Americans’ faith in their govt &amp; democratic institutions, including limiting the outsized influence of money in politics, restoring voting protections, &amp; modernizing government tech. #ForThePeople
In our great experiment in democracy, we’ve gone back &amp; forth about the best way to balance openness with security, broad participation with efficiency.  We’ve labored to make our government more transparent and accountable #ForthePeople.
Thank you for being here &amp; @StopBigMoney for hosting us. ECU is doing meaningful, important work &amp; it’s an example of a membership org sustained by thousands rallying behind a cause they believe in.  That’s how our democracy &amp; campaign finance are supposed to work. #ForThePeople
During the speech, my staff will live tweet my remarks. Follow along here &amp; through @StopBigMoney and join the conversation using the hashtag #ForthePeople. https://t.co/us38DeteYS
I am delivering remarks on government reform &amp; how a Democratic Majority would pass legislation to making government more responsive, representative, &amp; effective #ForthePeople in the opening days of the next Congress. Tune in on @Facebook Live: https://t.co/kpBSoX9q4u
Check out this article in today’s @RollCall on the speech I am delivering this morning on reforming government and making it more responsive, representative, and effective #ForthePeople it serves. Hope to see you there. https://t.co/92yNmYWS48
.@RealDonaldTrump ought to apologize, &amp; Congress ought to investigate what went wrong with the Admin’s response &amp; ensure it does not happen again. With #Florence now threatening our country, I pray @POTUS &amp; his team aren’t taking the same approach they did last year.
.@POTUS’ characterization of his Admin’s botched response to Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria as “incredibly successful” is offensive to the families of the nearly 3,000 Americans killed &amp; countless more who suffered for months without power or running water.  https://t.co/GwlLDSjLTv
Hurricane #Florence has the potential to bring severe flooding to our area. Marylanders should take every precaution to stay safe. Visit https://t.co/ebIjaxjMnM to find your evacuation zone &amp; follow @NWS_BaltWash &amp; @MDMEMA to keep up to date on weather in #MD05.
As we bow our heads in silent mourning, let us draw from this day the strength required to continue moving forward and meeting our challenges with the resolve no terror could ever shake.
I offer my gratitude for those who have served &amp; continue to serve in of our war against terrorism on the front lines or as first responders. To those who lost loved ones, including a number of my constituents, I offer my prayers on this somber anniversary. We will #NeverForget.
17 years ago, our nation was shaken by the #September11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, &amp; Flight 93. In the years since, America has faced challenges at home &amp; abroad that have called many to service, sacrifice, &amp; acts of selflessness.  https://t.co/0q2X5MP9Gu https://t.co/ykCG2v9aa0
After enacting a deeply unpopular #GOPTaxScam that overwhelmingly benefits the top 1%, while leaving the middle class behind &amp; exploding the deficit, the @HouseGOP is doubling down on policies skewed toward the wealthy &amp; adding trillions to the deficit. https://t.co/UnrTJWTxMI
Today’s @USGAO report concludes that @WMATA needs to improve the performance management of its workforce &amp; better assess pension risk. I hope WMATA leaders will take this report seriously &amp; implement reforms without delay. https://t.co/c1ine0dU4I
This evening, across America &amp; throughout the world, Jewish families will usher in the start of 5779.

There is welcome news in today's #JobsReport with 95 consecutive months of job growth. However, our economy continues to be plagued with structural challenges &amp; the GOP’s policies have only exacerbated these challenges through an irresponsible #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/HHspe0UoSu
I thank my friend @RepBarbaraLee for gathering colleagues &amp; friends on the House Floor to pay tribute to the late Ron Dellums. I join in remembering his life of service to others &amp; his unwavering commitment to human rights &amp; equal dignity for all people. https://t.co/aucb2lmJHy
I condemn this proposed rule &amp; call on the @SecAzar to reverse course. Instead of drafting this rule, the Admin ought to be working to #ReuniteEveryChild &amp; @HouseGOP should be taking action to hold the Admin accountable &amp; ensure these children are safe with their families.
The Admin’s rule to allow for the indefinite detention of children &amp; their families ignores our nation’s laws &amp; values. This ought to be condemned for what it is: inducing trauma in children in order to make a political argument. https://t.co/lSzrIoPrUd #EndFamilyDetention
Happy birthday to my friend, @repsandylevin. Thank you for your years of leadership on @WaysMeansCmte and work on behalf of #MI09’s working families. I’ll miss you in the halls of Congress next year.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on the @HFACDemocrats’ Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, @USRepKeating.
Happy birthday to my friend and a powerful voice for America’s working families on @WaysMeansCmte, @RepDannyDavis.
Today, the House will vote on a bill dealing with liquefied natural gas exports &amp; a motion to go to conference on Interior, Environment, Financial Services &amp; General Government, Agriculture, Transportation, &amp; Housing appropriations for #FY19. https://t.co/iue1D7JX1O
Today marks a full year after @POTUS announced he would end #DACA, &amp; despite the fact that nearly 90% of Americans want to ensure DREAMers can stay in the U.S., GOP leaders &amp; the Admin continue to block bipartisan solutions to #ProtectDREAMers.  https://t.co/UeuW52Qo71 https://t.co/Pr86ysq6Wk
Today, as oral arguments began in the GOP’s lawsuit to remove protections for 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, here is a reminder of just how out of step they are with the interests of the American people. RT to spread the word. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/JH6u3IVHf3

Happy birthday to my good friend, @RepHastingsFL. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member on @RulesDemocrats’ Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process.
Our hardworking federal civilian workforce has received nothing but constant attacks by the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress. We ought to recognize their dedicated service to our nation with a minimum pay adjustment of 1.9 percent.
It’s beyond cynical that @realDonaldTrump would cite serious economic &amp; fiscal concerns to justify his decision to cancel a modest pay adjustment for middle-class workers while he tweets constantly about economic gains &amp; touts a tax law that exploded the deficit by $1.5 trillion.
Joined colleagues in National Capital Region in urging Congressional leadership to reject @POTUS’ plan to cancel scheduled pay increase for federal workers. https://t.co/IJMjRNTrco
Grateful to meet w a delegation from #PuertoRico today to receive an update on how #OurFellowAmericans are recovering &amp; rebuilding nearly a full year after Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria made landfall on the island. I remain committed to ensuring they can rebuild stronger than before. https://t.co/7JWqQ9KL31
Joined Americans with pre-ex conditions like Kelly Gregory, who was diagnosed with breast cancer, to discuss how the GOP’s lawsuit, Texas v. United States, would turn back the clock for 133M Americans by denying them coverage or making it unaffordable. https://t.co/nvqerie53W https://t.co/ftlIncXrq6
The House will vote on 4 bills, including a bipartisan bill to promote student loan financial literacy. The bill is an important step to help borrowers plan, but falls short of a bipartisan reauthorization of the Higher Ed Act, which we should consider. https://t.co/yqCUI8OSi1
One year ago today, @POTUS ripped the rug out from under 800k #DREAMers by ending #DACA. RT if you agree @HouseGOP must stop obstructing &amp; work with Dems to bring to the Floor a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; provide them with a pathway to citizenship.
Sent letter to @SecretarySonny asking him to reconsider @USDA decision to relocate federal employees from Washington, DC area, which could be extremely disruptive for some #MD05 federal employees &amp; undermine quality of work. https://t.co/VDDTpP4P3v
Today on the Floor, the House will consider twelve bills and a motion to go to conference on @DeptofDefense, @USDOL, @HHSGov, and @usedgov appropriations for #FY19. https://t.co/S1FvKEE0Ip
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a passionate advocate fighting on behalf of #TX15’s working families &amp; small business owners on @FSCDems, @RepGonzalez.
I also told reporters that the Manafort guilty verdict and Cohen guilty pleas underscore the importance of the Special Counsel’s investigation. While the President continues to attempt to undermine the investigation &amp; attack DOJ, the verdict &amp; pleas ought to alarm all Americans.
In addition to funding govt, I reminded reporters we have a number of important priorities that need to be address this month: #FarmBill, #VAWA, FAA, WRDA, and taking action to #protectDREAMers.
I told reporters we have 11 legislative days until the end of the fiscal year &amp; GOP in the House continue to fail to do the business of funding government. I urge @HouseGOP to drop their insistence on poison pill riders and work with Dems to responsibly fund government by 9/30.
Today, as the House reconvenes following the August District Work Period, I told reporters at my weekly press conference that the @HouseGOP’s culture of corruption, cronyism, &amp; incompetence was on full display over the past month.
The Admin’s failure to reunite families is a humanitarian tragedy. These families must be reunited - not only because the courts have ordered so but because America is better than this. I will continue to join Dems to demand answers from the Admin until they #ReuniteEveryChild.
Today, I led members of the @HispanicCaucus in another letter to @SecNielsen, @SecAzar, @SecPompeo, &amp; @TheJusticeDept demanding answers about the number &amp; status of children separated from their parents in detention facilities. https://t.co/VrljzFPwBv #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/eKObatSaME
On #LaborDay, we celebrate the workers’ rights victories that enabled generations of our people to #MakeItInAmerica. Let us continue to stand up for the hard-won rights of working Americans &amp; commit to making the American Dream attainable for all. https://t.co/Sb2ujniWBb https://t.co/ZzyB9168yD
It is shameful the GOP-led Congress refuses to take action to #protectDREAMers. I will continue working with my colleagues to counter the Admin’s malign policies that seek to tear families apart, &amp; will continue to advocate for a permanent legislative solution.
While yesterday’s ruling will allow DACA renewals to continue, #DREAMers, their families, &amp; communities deserve to have long-term certainty that these young people can remain here &amp; continue to contribute to our nation’s future.  https://t.co/PpfAFB9Y3k
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a passionate advocate on behalf of #TX09’s working families, @RepAlGreen.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepTomSuozzi. Thank your for your leadership and commitment to bipartisan solutions as Vice-Chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus.
By eliminating modest annual pay increases &amp; locality adjustments in 2019, @RealDonaldTrump is effectively taking away from federal civilian employee’s hard-earned paycheck. I will be working with my colleagues in Congress to overturn the Admin’s decision. https://t.co/PZHfqPm9BG
We must take measures to ascertain the full extent of the hurricanes’ devastation to lives &amp; property. I remain committed to working with my colleagues to ensure #OurFellowAmericans in #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI can rebuild stronger &amp; more resilient than before.
The latest death toll estimate in Puerto Rico further confirms the Admin’s response to Hurricanes Maria &amp; Irma was woefully inadequate. Congress must meet its responsibility to conduct oversight &amp; hold the Admin accountable for missteps after the storms. https://t.co/5xMDd9WVvO
55 yrs ago today, Dr. King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial &amp; shared w/ our country &amp; the world his dream of equality &amp; justice.

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend &amp; Ranking Member on the @VetAffairsDems’ Subcommittee on Health, @JuliaBrownley26.
Today’s report from @GSA_OIG on FBI HQ project is extremely alarming &amp; raises serious concerns about @POTUS’ involvement. The Admin must answer all questions related to the decision to cancel the previous procurement process for a new consolidated FBI HQ. https://t.co/hh6vJFM99D
As details from #Jacksonville emerge, it appears our nation has suffered yet another preventable mass shooting. Inaction is unacceptable, and I continue to call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to #EndGunViolence. #NeverAgain https://t.co/Xm4Bnkb8fF
I am closely monitoring the situation in Jacksonville, FL. My thoughts are with the victims &amp; their families as well as the brave men &amp; women of @JSOPIO for their immediate response to secure the scene and treat victims.
Few have endured for their country as John McCain, &amp; few have served as faithfully as he served. Today, the U.S. Senate loses a giant, the people of AZ remember their champion, &amp; our nation mourns a hero. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the McCain family. https://t.co/3YCmsibCUE

Thank you to my friend @RepLawrence for hosting a roundtable event today with automakers to discuss how we can ensure more workers and businesses in the Motor City &amp; across the country can #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/XHmxAzHvXN
Our people deserve a government that works for them, that isn’t mired in corruption and mismanagement, and that is composed of men and women who do not see themselves as above the law but as its faithful guardians.
Today’s conviction of Manafort &amp; guilty plea by Cohen demonstrate why the special counsel must continue unimpeded. These developments ought to alarm all concerned about the proper function of our govt &amp; foreign efforts to erode trust in our institutions. https://t.co/RKHAyqW180

We’ve all seen the effects of climate change &amp; instead of ignoring this global challenge, America ought to lead efforts to address it. I urge the Trump Admin to stop taking away America’s ability to lead &amp; secure a better future for our country and our planet.
The @EPA’s rule announced today to end the Clean Power Plan is yet another example of this Administration placing the profits of large corporations ahead of the safety of our children &amp; the future of our planet. https://t.co/SemgmVeaK4

The maligning of immigrants – particularly immigrants of color – diminishes our country.  I hope Director Cissna will not give CIS and its leaders the unwarranted gift of having a senior government official address the group.
I am appalled that @USCIS Director Cissna is scheduled to give remarks at an event hosted by an anti-immigrant hate group, Center for Immigration Studies. I wrote a letter to him today urging him to cancel the appearance: https://t.co/rjBDzUmhjO https://t.co/PM1qN6lwvV
As we celebrate #SocSec83, let us recommit ourselves to protecting &amp; strengthening this vital program that allows millions of seniors to retire with dignity and ensuring that it is sound &amp; accessible for future generations of retirees.

As we mark this somber anniversary, &amp; in advance of the rally planned for this weekend, let us recommit ourselves to the work of defending America’s ideals. Let us never waver in our determination to ensure tolerance, justice, &amp; unity shines upon every community across our land.
This weekend, we mark the anniversary of the vile &amp; violent rally by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, &amp; the Alt-Right in Charlottesville. We remember Heather Heyer, who was murdered by purveyors of terror while standing up for the values of our country. https://t.co/dAHuuvPESb https://t.co/J4CJgfGeqH
I will continue to monitor the situation closely, with those living in Israeli border communities in my thoughts during this time of danger. They ought to know with certainty that Americans stand with them in the face of this terror.
I condemn unequivocally the Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza against Israeli civilians. #Israel is completely justified to use force to defend itself against these violent attacks as well as attacks launched across its northern border from Lebanon &amp; Syria. https://t.co/UUoGUWVrSo
I will continue working closely with @NydiaVelazquez &amp; other advocates for Puerto Rico in Congress to ensure that the commonwealth, along with the #USVI &amp; affected parts of the mainland, have all the resources needed to rebuild stronger.
The revised official death toll of #OurFellowAmericans from Hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria in #PuertoRico is tragic &amp; alarming. As much as the Admin wishes to obscure the extent of this disaster &amp; its deeply flawed response, the human impact has been devastating. https://t.co/lX1mPxcGYo
While the Admin &amp; @HouseGOP pursue policies that favor the wealthy &amp; well connected, House Dems are fighting back against this culture of corruption &amp; offering #ABetterDeal. Read our plan to return to a government of, by, &amp; #ForthePeople: https://t.co/rb8M8Vl2xC

Today, we mark 20 yrs since bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi &amp; Dar es Salaam took the lives of 12 Americans &amp; over 200 local residents. On this somber anniversary, let us pay tribute to all who serve our nation as diplomats as well as their families. https://t.co/hmZ5iN9lXP

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Vice Chair &amp; Labor Liaison for @USProgressives, @KeithEllison.
As @RealDonaldTrump trumpets this month’s jobs report, I would remind him that the #JobsReport for July 2016 showed the economy created 325,000 jobs under President Obama, more than twice as many jobs as today’s report.
House Dems are standing up #ForthePeople to raise wages, lower health care costs, &amp; put a stop to corruption. A strong economy isn’t just about how many jobs we create – it’s about making sure that workers &amp; entrepreneurs have the tools to succeed in our economy and get ahead.
Today’s #JobsReport continues to reveal structural problems affecting workers, small biz, &amp; long-term growth. While GOP promised wage increases for workers from the #GOPTaxScam, the reality is those benefiting are large corporations &amp; wealthy investors. https://t.co/kvi7RHLxhK
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepJackyRosen. Thank you for your leadership &amp; work to protect health coverage for 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions from the Trump Administration’s attempts to undermine the #ACA.
This change in policy would prevent states like MD &amp; others from enforcing future-looking efficiency standards, denying these states the right to protect their residents from higher gas prices &amp; pollution. I strongly urge @POTUS not to implement this change.
The Trump Admin’s announcement today shows they are playing dangerous, partisan games with our nation’s energy security. This freeze of fuel economy standards will lead to consumers paying more at the pump &amp; stifling of innovation in the auto industry. https://t.co/sVHhgFgJ2c
Congress ought to be taking steps to strengthen the nation’s health care system &amp; build on it to help people &amp; our economy get ahead. Democrats will continue to fight to bring down the cost of health care coverage &amp; out-of-pocket costs for working families. #ProtectOurCare
The Trump Admin’s assault on access to affordable health care continues by allowing the sale of junk plans. These plans can discriminate against those w pre-existing conditions, deny coverage for basic health benefits, &amp; will lead to skyrocketing premiums. https://t.co/xjl6WjlIAD
Republicans promised a simpler tax code &amp; massive wage gains from the #GOPTaxScam. The latest reminder of these broken promises is a report from the @USGAO suggests more than 1-in-5 taxpayers will find that they owe at least $100 when filing their taxes. https://t.co/4Fm9s5VaKf

.@POTUS must abide by the court ruling and reunite these children with their families.  He must work to address this unnecessary crisis of his own making. It is shameful that @HouseGOP has done nothing to address these forced separations of parents &amp; children.

It’s time to unleash the full potential of our economy by putting our faith in the American people.  For the people, for our future, 2018 is the moment for us to #MakeItInAmerica.
#MakeItInAmerica is focused on making it possible again for every hardworking American to get ahead.  Just like Margaret Hanley’s father and grandfather did.  Just as young Katy McGarry dreams for her future and Dr. Quentin Bullock wants for his aspiring entrepreneurs.
If we can make Congress a partner again in helping businesses &amp; workers get ahead, we can begin to renew Americans’ faith in government as a force for good. We can renew Americans’ faith that our institutions are strong enough to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
We need to encourage entrepreneurship by ensuring access to workplace benefits like health care and retirement security, and we need to provide stronger tools to help innovators grow their ideas into successful businesses.
Education, entrepreneurship, &amp; infrastructure.  In these three areas, Congress needs to step up &amp; act. We need to promote pathways to career opportunities and make training and education more affordable and accessible.
Congress must do more to bring affordable, high-speed internet access to communities across the country. @USProgressives is on the right track, detailing in its 21st Century New Deal for Jobs how Congress can expand internet quality &amp; access through private &amp; public investment.
At the same time, we must also build the innovative infrastructure of the future. Congress should ensure that America has a reliable &amp; efficient electrical grid that includes clean energy resources. Our grid has to be resilient in the face of a changing climate &amp; extreme weather.
We have an opportunity to unleash our economy &amp; the creation of good jobs by repairing &amp; rebuilding our aging infrastructure. Congress must commit to real, multi-year, &amp; fully-funded authorizing bills to tackle the backlog both for transportation networks &amp; water infrastructure.
In April, I was with @RepAndreCarson in Indianapolis where we heard from the city’s Director of Public Works. It costs Indianapolis $200M a year just to maintain its infrastructure. If they wanted to upgrade their infrastructure, it would require an additional $2.5B in investment
There is another critical issue Congress must address if our entrepreneurs &amp; workers are going to #MakeItInAmerica --that’s infrastructure.  No biz today can compete &amp; succeed if it can’t access information quickly, be accessible to its workers, &amp; reach its customers efficiently.
One solution is to build on the JOBS Act, which expanded crowdfunding opportunities. Another is to promote regional industry clusters, where entrepreneurs leverage local expertise in a sector to encourage innovative risk-taking in order to compete nationally &amp; globally.
Another area where Congress should take action is by providing better and stronger tools to help innovators grow ideas into successful businesses – to bridge the gap between incubation and investment.
We need to build on the #ACA for portable benefits that reduce the risk of leaving a stable job to start a small business.
Also, the loss of access to workplace benefits like health insurance, disability insurance, &amp; a stable 401(k) is one of the most significant barriers for entrepreneurs striking out on their own.
Dr. Bullock also talked about an entrepreneurship program tailored for those re-entering from prison, reinforcing–as the @OfficialCBC points out in its “We Have A Lot To Lose” report–that criminal justice reform is essential to all of our people being able to #MakeItInAmerica.
Dr. Quintin Bullock, President of @CCAC, told us about how, working with local business &amp; civic leaders, the College aligned its curriculum &amp; created an entrepreneurial program for students.  Now, they can learn not only advanced skills but also how to launch their own companies.
One of the stops on our #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour was Pittsburgh. @USRepMikeDoyle &amp; I visited @eicpittsburgh.  There, community &amp; corporate leaders have partnered w universities to create a “living laboratory” where students &amp; researchers can get help incubating businesses.
.@KauffmanFDN – a leading voice on entrepreneurship that I visited w @Rep Cleaver on the #ListeningTour– wrote in its 2018 State of Entrepreneurship report: “The long-term decline in entrepreneurship has dragged down productivity, wages, and living standards for all Americans.”
In addition to education and skills training, #MakeItInAmerica focuses on entrepreneurship.  Support for entrepreneurship has been a core component of the #MakeItInAmerica plan since the beginning because it is the fuel that powers job growth.  But that’s not all.
#MakeItInAmerica envisions an economy where graduates and workers are always able to access new skills and build on what they already know – whether at the start of their careers, in the middle, or later.  Because that’s how workers adapt &amp; get ahead.
.@EdWorkforceDems have an “Aim Higher” agenda that would allow Pell grants to be used for training programs that achieve certifications, not only four year degrees.
Closing the skills gap will require a greater federal role in comprehensive training for workers of all skill levels &amp; career stages, as the @HouseNewDems suggested as part of its Economic Opportunity Agenda.
I visited a training center in Toledo with @RepMarcyKaptur that is engaged in this type of programming and was impressed by the work they are doing &amp; the success they are having – much of it thanks to organized labor.
Many local school districts are already leading the way in promoting pathways to career opportunities by engaging middle- and high-school students early in order to identify those interested in careers that require less than a four-year degree but more than a high-school diploma.
Adaptation and continuing skills training is the key to success in the 21st century economy.  And for those with in-demand skills, our economy is rife with opportunity.  Indeed, we have a shortage of skilled workers, with more jobs available than people to fill them.
In WI, I joined @RepRonKind for a listening session with college students. Katy McGarry, who was the student body president at the @UWEauClaire, told me: “We know that we aren’t just going to be changing jobs but changing careers over the course of our time in the workforce.”
The first area #MakeItInAmerica addresses is education and skills training.
Throughout the #ListeningTour, what we heard from the people we met was essentially the same: Congress needs to be a partner in enabling our people to get ahead. We also came back to Washington with new ideas that come straight from the front lines of our economy.
Unions are crucial in the fight for equal pay for women, affordable health care &amp; child care, paid family leave, protections against workforce discrimination, &amp; so much more. If Dems want to be the party of workers, we also need to be the party of employers.
Visiting Chicago with @janschakowsky, we heard from labor about how efforts to undermine workers’ rights are disadvantaging working families.  We ought to be making it easier, not harder, for workers to organize and bargain collectively.
In Las Vegas and Indianapolis, local leaders talked about building the infrastructure necessary to access national and global markets and attract investment. #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour
In Kansas City, Pittsburgh, and Madison, we listened to entrepreneurs and innovators talk about the difficulties of launching and sustaining businesses that hire locally.  #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour
In Peoria, Toledo, and Eau Claire, we heard from Margaret and from other business owners, educators, and students about the challenges of preparing a twenty-first century workforce. #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour
But when you go out to the heartland and talk to workers and employers, to innovators and entrepreneurs, it’s clear that many people are underemployed and that our economy continues to face serious long-term challenges.  That’s why I launched the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour.
As our economy continues to strengthen, we must do more to ensure that workers can take care of their families.  To do that, we need to raise wages, health care more affordable, &amp; stop gov’t corruption that worsens inequality.
In the wake of our recovery, we’ve gotten our economy back on its feet.  People are getting by.  But they’re not getting ahead.  And that’s what our country is supposed to do: give everyone a shot at getting ahead. That’s what it means to #MakeItInAmerica
In every corner there is a Margaret Hanley trying to build a business &amp; create opportunities for her workers.  And across America are workers who have jobs – but those jobs don’t open doors of opportunity like they once did or provide the middle-class life our workers expect.
In addition to college tuition, she cited homeownership, child care, &amp; retirement savings as opportunities workers today find more &amp; more out of reach.
Margaret said: “My 15 employees are middle-class. They make $30k- $50k a year. But the middle class can’t afford all these investments in themselves. They can make a good living, but the money isn’t there to educate their kids.”
I asked Margaret how her company is faring now, ten years after the Great Recession.  I asked whether her workers have access to the kind of opportunities that made it possible for her father and grandfather [who worked at and later owned the business] to get ahead.
On the #ListeningTour, I sat down with local business owners, educators, and workers and asked them about the challenges they’re facing.  One of them was Margaret Hanley, A. Lucas &amp; Sons steel fabricator.
I’ve crossed the country to hear directly from Americans about how they are faring in today’s economy.  In April, I traveled with @RepCheri Bustos to Peoria. In Peoria, people have been building America, growing America, and making it in America for generations. #MakeItInAmerica
Thank you to everyone who is here this morning. @WeWork is an example of how Americans are adapting to changes in the global economy. #MakeItInAmerica
During my remarks, my staff will live tweet from the speech. You can follow along using the hashtag #MakeItInAmerica.
I’m at the @WeWork Dupont Circle delivering a speech on what I heard from the American people on the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour &amp; how we will respond to economic challenges &amp; opportunities with our updated #MakeItInAmerica plan. Watch here: https://t.co/N2hF36ljNO

The Putin regime has consistently worked against the interests of the United States and our allies. I introduced legislation today to hold Russia accountable for its malign activities and safeguard our country. Here’s how: https://t.co/TDWcwTdGNp https://t.co/NHX31Hz4XH

Joined MD colleagues in writing to @SecNielsen to request full support for MD’s request for technical assistance to review and protect our state’s election systems. #ProtectOurDemocracy https://t.co/0lrFFQOZ7u
.@realDonaldTrump’s continuing failure to address this threat to our democracy requires that Congress do everything in its power to ensure that our states are prepared and our election systems are secure for the 2018 election.

After @POTUS’ shameful display in Helsinki, some Republicans have expressed concern, but claim “there is nothing we can do.”   But there is something we can &amp; must do: bring this legislation to the Floor &amp; pass it with strong bipartisan support.
Joined House Dems to introduce the Secure America from Russian Interference Act, a bipartisan, comprehensive bill to do what @RealDonaldTrump has repeatedly failed to do: hold Russia accountable, strengthen our election security, &amp; bolster our alliances. https://t.co/GlBMe6N3vh https://t.co/Iaoui557DJ
.@RealDonaldTrump refuses to stand up to Putin, so Congress must act to secure the U.S.   Today, I introduced the bipartisan Secure America from Russian Interference Act to strengthen our election security, hold Russia accountable, &amp; bolster our alliances. https://t.co/OfPtOLHBSE
Congress must do everything in its power to protect the American people, and this legislation is a major step in the right direction. #ProtectOurDemocracy
This legislation brings together a number of bills—many of which are bipartisan—that are aimed at safeguarding our national security &amp; protecting Americans’ right to vote &amp; have their vote counted accurately.
Today, we are introducing bipartisan, comprehensive legislation to do what @realDonaldTrump has repeatedly failed to do: ❌ hold Russia accountable ❌ strengthen our election security ❌ bolster our alliances
The #Putin regime has consistently worked against the interests of the U.S.&amp; our allies by attacking our democracy; stealing Crimea &amp; illegally occupying Georgia; supporting Assad in Syria &amp; murdering opponents; &amp; attacking Western democracies &amp; our critical @NATO alliance.
I’m joining @RepEliotEngel @RepMaxineWaters @RepJerryNadler &amp; House Dems to introduce the Secure America from Russian Interference Act. Tune in to see us discuss how our bill Russian accountable for its malign activities: https://t.co/46JckTCrcc

Today on the Floor, the House is also wasting time on a political messaging bill instead of addressing the challenges we face. What urgent priorities do you think we should be working on?

Shame on @HouseGOP for using their House Majority to put blatant partisanship ahead of the wellbeing of children.  Shame on @HouseGOP for using our law enforcement agents as pawns in your political games.  Democrats will continue speaking out until we #ReuniteEveryChild.
I am voting present on the GOP resolution on the Floor today because it is a sham &amp; an outrageous attempt to hide the continued suffering of children. It is a distraction from the fact that Republicans refuse to address the family separation crisis created by @POTUS. https://t.co/35Xx7sBotJ
🚨🚨🚨  Coats said last week: “The warning lights are blinking red again… the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.”   @POTUS refuses to take this threat seriously. @HouseGOP should work w Dems to secure our elections &amp; #ProtectOurDemocracy. https://t.co/ZtBUpliXHQ
On the Floor today, @HouseGOP is holding a political vote to distract from the fact that they have failed to address the Trump Administration’s family separation crisis &amp; work to #ReuniteEveryChild. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/bI3y2oe5Kg
As the #AllStarGame gets underway, here's a reminder that while @POTUS promised he would “drain the swamp” &amp; hire the “best people,” he has led a corruption all-star team of current &amp; former officials who have used public office for private financial gain &amp; abused taxpayer $. https://t.co/TCstV8632N
While Dems support holding China accountable on trade, @POTUS’ lack of a strategy is leaving some American workers in the lurch. Thank you @RepDelBene for your bill to ensure workers who have lost their jobs due to retaliation against POTUS’ tariffs have the assistance they need. https://t.co/xOi3hyTuI7
Democrats strongly believe we must level the playing field on trade, but @POTUS’ ham-handed approach has led to retaliation that hurts some American businesses and their workers. Thanks to @RepSchneider for introducing a bill to assist America’s small businesses. https://t.co/0SuVOABTdL
Thank you to members of @ProChoiceCaucus, including Chairs @RepDianaDeGette &amp; @RepBarbaraLee, for speaking out about #WhatsAtStake &amp; the urgent need to #StopKavanaugh.

Yesterday, the world witnessed @POTUS side w Putin over America’s intel community, which has confirmed that Russia interfered in our elections. Now, national security officials are speaking out about how @RealDonaldTrump’s comments make America less safe: https://t.co/RJ7mwEWXzu
I will continue to monitor the progress of the CBOC in Charlotte Hall, as well as the satellite location in Lexington Park. I am hopeful that both facilities can move forward quickly so veterans can access services for their health care needs close to home.
Our veterans deserve the best quality of care. I have worked for many years to secure funding for this project and appreciate the efforts local stakeholders have put into advancing this project.
Pleased a contract has been award for a new CBOC in Charlotte Hall. This development is long overdue, but I am pleased that the new facility can finally begin construction. https://t.co/LMXuIda4LM
Must-read report released by @EnergyCommerce highlighting disturbing levels of lead in public school drinking water. The @EPA must take steps to safeguard children’s health &amp; ensure drinking water is clean. @USGAO’s recommendations are an important first step. https://t.co/nH5nVWO4VM
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and Senior Whip, @RepKClark. Thank you for your leadership and advocacy on behalf of children and families in #MA05.
Today, the House will consider 14 bills &amp; begin debate on a GOP minibus funding bill that fails to fund priorities like election security &amp; includes controversial policy provisions that undermine Dodd-Frank, #ACA, environmental &amp; public health protections. https://t.co/0Fr69y0kw3
This morning, I also urged Members of the Senate to #StopKavanaugh. This nomination is a direct threat to Americans’ health care and the power of women to make their own health care decisions. #WhatAtStake
I also said I cannot understand why Republicans didn’t include funding to protect U.S. elections in the minibus funding bill. Why Republicans continue to undermine #electionsecurity when we know Russians are seeking to attack our democracy is beyond me.
I told press that Democrats will oppose the minibus funding bill on the Floor this week based on process &amp; substance. This bill rolls back Dodd-Frank, undermines the #ACA, interferes with #DC’s right to self-governance, &amp; repeals the Waters of the United States rule.
When speaking with reporters today, I said yesterday was one of the saddest performances I’ve seen by a President of the United States. I agree w @JohnBrennan, the President’s comments were “nothing short of treasonous” &amp; undermine U.S. interests &amp; credibility around the world.
The Administration is presenting families with a false choice &amp; swapping a cruel policy of separating children from their parents with costly &amp; inhumane family detention. RT if you agree the Trump Admin’s solutions are unacceptable. #FamiliesBelongTogether #ReuniteEveryChild
.@HouseGOP has been complicit in this President’s attempts to undermine our national security. It is time to bring legislation to the Floor to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.
The international community saw @realDonaldTrump deflect, dissemble, &amp; undermine American law enforcement professionals, all while praising Russia’s dictator who: ❌ Interfered in our elections ❌ Invaded Ukraine ❌ Violates human rights ❌ Supports Assad in Syria
Why is it that @POTUS chooses to take Vladimir Putin at his word while refusing to accept the careful determination of our nation’s intelligence agencies that Russia’s government interfered in our election?
Today is a black day in American history. The world watched as the President of the United States refused to hold Russia accountable and continues to cozy up to its autocratic leader. I agree with John Brennan, who said that it was “nothing short of treasonous.” #TrumpPutin

The Administration’s assertion that the War on Poverty is “largely over and a success” is flat wrong. Success will continue to prove elusive as long as the GOP insists on disinvesting in key anti-poverty programs. My statement with @RepBarbaraLee: https://t.co/0iBC8YQQIs
Democrats support holding China accountable on trade, but the #TrumpTradeWar is leaving America’s dairy farmers in the lurch. That’s unacceptable. RT if you agree. https://t.co/lFQWRr98FA https://t.co/5Hn78I7nwz
The United States and @UN sanctions must remain in place until material progress is achieved towards complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.
The Trump Administration must continue to enforce #NorthKorea sanctions and make clear – particularly to China – that sanctions against the Kim regime will be fully enforced, especially given the lack of progress in negotiations. https://t.co/e7YlkThKXP
I applaud the @UN Security Council for taking action today to stop the violence in #SouthSudan. The arms embargo adopted is a major step toward preventing further escalation and encouraging both sides to negotiate a peaceful solution. https://t.co/BCKIWAOAMD
What will the #TrumpTradeWar cost you? This guide from the @NYTimes shows what families are expected to pay because of @POTUS’ ham-handed approach to trade. While I support smart enforcement of trade policy, President Trump has missed the mark. https://t.co/AKHEDNma3V
Instead of holding China accountable for its unfair trade practices, the #TrumpTradeWar is harming Americans across the country. America’s soybean farmers are among those paying the price: https://t.co/lFQWRqRxh0 https://t.co/BqLM3SqMv1
We must determine how Russia acted to subvert our democracy so that we can ensure precautions are taken this year and in the future to deter and prevent its next attempts.  The #SpecialCounsel must be allowed to continue and complete his investigation unimpeded.
.@RealDonaldTrump’s continued denials of Russia’s role is bewildering, and the fact that he plans to meet with President Putin in Helsinki on Monday as he plays apologist for Russia is dangerous.
Today’s indictments show once again that #Russia was engaging in a direct attack on our democracy, intended to undermine Americans’ faith in our democratic institutions &amp; to exacerbate social &amp; political divisions within our country. https://t.co/40E10pAZGV #ProtectOurDemocracy
I support smart trade enforcement, but the #TrumpTradeWar is hurting Americans right now. Read here about how @RealDonaldTrump’s scattershot tariffs are “taking a major toll” on manufacturers like Missouri’s Mid-Continent Nail Corporation: https://t.co/lFQWRr98FA https://t.co/WA0rCZT0Je
I urge @POTUS to exercise more discretion when dealing with foreign leaders, particularly our closest allies, so as not to create unnecessary wedges that Russia and other adversaries can exploit to weaken our nation and our partners.
.@RealDonaldTrump’s blatant interference in the democratic politics of our ally the U.K. is appalling.  Interfering in the democratic processes of another sovereign nation is never appropriate &amp; undermines the trust between our nations. https://t.co/Qi3tshQkfT
.@POTUS’ tariffs stack the deck against American dairy farmers, manufacturers, &amp; workers. We need a common sense approach to trade enforcement that protects workers, not a #TrumpTradeWar. RT to spread the word. https://t.co/lFQWRr98FA https://t.co/Tij73ttZJS

Appreciate @RepBrady, @RepZoeLofgren &amp; @RepRaskin's diligence in continuing to highlight the urgent need to protect our nation’s election infrastructure. https://t.co/fauu0yyxFI
We need smart enforcement actions against unfair trade practices, but @RealDonaldTrump’s actions to date have missed the mark and hurt American workers. In fact, the #TrumpTradeWar could cost the beverage industry over 20,000 American jobs. https://t.co/lFQWRr98FA https://t.co/ZcKmLCXIGV
Who is hurt by the #TrumpTradeWar?  American workers &amp; manufacturers who are seeing layoffs due to @RealDonaldTrump’s tariffs and economic policy. Democrats agree we need to address unfair trade practices, but Trump’s scattershot approach doesn’t work.   https://t.co/lFQWRr98FA https://t.co/ZTbdGhtPe0
Not only does this bill maintain a focus on counterterrorism &amp; election security – including provisions requiring foreign attacks on our elections be reported to Congress – it also requires reporting on #Iran’s role in #Syria &amp; illicit revenue sources for the North Korean regime.

Thank you @RepLloydDoggett for highlighting the importance of protections for Americans w pre-existing conditions.  Today, @HouseGOP made clear once again that they want to return us to the days when insurers could discriminate against 133 million Americans w pre-ex conditions. https://t.co/ZBkNyvz70H
The @WhiteHouse promised Americans a $4,000 raise as a result of the #GOPTaxScam, but this @CBSNews headline makes clear there’s “little evidence” for that as the law is benefiting the wealthiest Americans and large corporations – not workers. https://t.co/6KV0aRP7vZ
If the Administration turns away those in desperate need of safety, who are then harmed or killed upon being returned to their home countries, @POTUS – &amp; @HouseGOP, who are complicit with their conspicuous silence on this issue – will have blood on their hands.
It is just the latest in a series of steps by this Administration to undercut our asylum laws and turn away those seeking to escape danger, along with its policy of forcibly separating children from their parents.  #KeepFamiliesTogether
The Trump Administration’s new policy of rejecting asylum claims out of hand for those fleeing gang warfare or domestic violence violates international law &amp; runs counter to our values as a nation.  https://t.co/ETe0jx0hgx

While @SpeakerRyan says Americans are #BetterOffNow, here's a fact check: ❌ Wages aren’t increasing. Instead, they're falling. ❌ GDP growth fell to just 2%. ❌ The #GOPTaxScam added trillions to the deficit. ❌ Americans are paying more for health care. https://t.co/nHhAgfmBht
With more than 117,000 children waiting to be adopted and nearly four times that in foster care, Democrats strongly oppose this effort by Republicans to put political messaging to the extreme right ahead of the needs of these children.
The amendment inserted into the Labor-HHS approps bill today would give child welfare &amp; placement orgs a #licensetodiscriminate &amp; deny adoption or fostering opportunities to qualified families on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, or religion.
Once again, Republicans have chosen to use their House Majority to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.  This time, their victims also include children in need of safe and loving homes.  https://t.co/ZlXWCOfjBO https://t.co/cgJKfzv8vc
I’m proud the House unanimously adopted a resolution making clear America’s steadfast support for the @NATO alliance. No matter what @POTUS falsely claims, the U.S. gains as much from our membership in the alliance as our NATO partners. https://t.co/OKDsZHShzC
RT to remind @RealDonaldTrump that @NATO has supported the United States for years while Russia’s Putin has committed human rights abuses &amp; attempted to undermine our elections. https://t.co/hskGdZzHXZ

I strongly support our @NATO partners &amp; the sacrifice they make on behalf of our common cause of freedom. https://t.co/HVqA73g9jc https://t.co/JF2UqJSVDb
The Trump Admin has created a false choice: either separate families or detain them indefinitely. These are cruel &amp; inhumane policies to impose on women &amp; children fleeing violence &amp; seeking refuge. The Administration must #EndFamilyDetention &amp; utilize humane alternatives.
Once again, the House paused to remember victims of #GunViolence. When will Republicans join us in saying #EnoughIsEnough? Congress must take action to keep Americans safe in school, in newsrooms, in movie theaters, in nightclubs, &amp; public places across the country. #NeverAgain

This time last year, Senators on both sides of the aisle came together to stop attempts to repeal the #ACA &amp; raise health care costs with #TrumpCare. I urge Senators to once again come together and #StopKavanaugh.
A Supreme Court appointment is an appointment for life. If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, environmental protections, voting rights, &amp; LGBT rights are also at stake. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to roll back women’s access to health care &amp; her reproductive rights. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh
The next Justice on #SCOTUS will rule on landmark decisions that affect health care access &amp; protections for 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Judge Kavanaugh has made clear he would rule against the #ACA. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh

To date, they have failed to provide a response despite daily inquiries. In fact, @TheJusticeDept claimed to have “no role” in family separation, notwithstanding the fact that Attorney General Sessions proudly announced the policy that created the crisis.

I strongly urge Senators on both sides of the aisle – especially those who have come together before to defeat efforts to repeal the ACA and roll back reproductive health care rights – to defeat this nomination. #StopKavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh has a record of opposition to the #ACA &amp; women’s reproductive rights. If he were to sit on #SCOTUS, it could mean a return to a time when those with pre-ex conditions were uninsurable &amp; the end of reproductive choice. #WhatsAtStake https://t.co/lNBjiSEGqw
As @realDonaldTrump prepares to announce his SCOTUS nominee, it’s clear #WhatsAtStake. From protecting access to health care to defending women’s, LGBT, &amp; voting rights, Dems remain committed to standing up for equality and justice for all Americans.
#OTD 150 years ago, after the great struggle to end the evil of slavery, Congress &amp; the states ratified the #14thAmendment, enshrining into our Constitution the principle that all Americans are entitled to equal protection under our laws. https://t.co/lvhNJLnsQ6 https://t.co/TeEiB7mOvl

The Trump Administration’s decision to freeze payment transfers under the ACA’s risk adjustment program is the latest attempt to undermine the law, inject uncertainty into the health care system, increase premiums, &amp; put coverage at risk. https://t.co/L20QlYavZp #ProtectOurCare
It’s #MarylandMonday -- What is your favorite summer activity in MD?
Joined House Dems &amp; our brothers &amp; sisters in labor to discuss the harmful impact of #JanusvAFSCME on workers, including teachers &amp; first responders.

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseAgDems, Rep. Collin Peterson.
A free press is one of our nation’s founding principles, &amp; this unconscionable attack is extremely troubling. I stand with the @CapGazNews as they grieve the loss of their colleagues and friends.
The talented men and women of @CapGazNews newsroom are dedicated to telling the stories of their community. The fact that they worked through their grief to put out today’s paper is a testament to that dedication.
Rebecca was a kind and thoughtful person and a friend to many.
Gerald was a dedicated editor and excellent writer, with a knack for the issues most important to the people of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County.
Wendi was a prolific and hardworking reporter. She was well known in her community for her reporting, volunteer work, and role as a ‘proud Navy mom.’
John was a talented reporter and editor who I was fortunate to work with in his coverage of Bowie and local politics. His coverage was always fair, and I appreciated his diligence and commitment to his profession.
Rob was an outstanding editor who cared deeply about his staff and mentoring reporters. I enjoyed our many conversations over the years and valued his insight.
My heart breaks for @CapGazNews today. My prayers are with the families, friends, &amp; colleagues of Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Gerald Fischman, &amp; Rebecca Smith as they grieve for their loved ones. (THREAD.) https://t.co/aM4ErevOhi
The Trump Administration is putting coverage at risk for 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. RT if you agree with a majority of Americans that protections for those individuals ought to remain in place. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/W8S7OA6IPO
Many children face immigration proceedings alone. We must ensure the system works and is capable of delivering fair hearings to those seeking asylum, especially children.
Visited the Arlington Immigration Courthouse in Crystal City with @RepDonBeyer &amp; Members of @HispanicCaucus to better understand the process by which unaccompanied minors receive due process. https://t.co/XZ6GThcLjD
I join in thanking our brave first responders for their immediate response to the situation. My thoughts and prayers remain with the victims, their loved ones, and the entire #CapitalGazette family during this difficult time.
I was heartbroken to learn of the shooting this afternoon in Annapolis. I have known the hardworking staff of the @CapGazNews for many years, &amp; I extend my deepest condolences to the dedicated editors, reporters, &amp; staff. https://t.co/C5oBQHEnOK
Monitoring reports of a shooting at @CapGazNews in Annapolis. My thoughts and prayers are with the staff, first responders, &amp; others on the scene. Thank you @AACOPD for your immediate response.
Today, Dems &amp; GOP came together to fund our military for FY19, a sign of our common commitment to strong defense. While there are provisions in this bill that could be made better, overall it represents a bipartisan compromise &amp; adheres to budget caps.  https://t.co/rEnVs5um6t
.@HouseGOP, are you listening?    Democrats are speaking out on behalf of children separated from their parents &amp; for the DREAMers left in limbo by your inaction.   It’s time to work together on bipartisan solutions to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; #KeepFamiliesTogether. RT if you agree. https://t.co/y0n2kxw1X7
.@POTUS may think he can play good cop, but backslapping &amp; smiles will not change Putin’s behavior or stop Russia’s aggression or its nefarious efforts to undermine American democracy. I urge him to take a tough approach &amp; to do so in concert with our NATO allies.
If @POTUS does meet with Putin, he must address Russia’s human rights shortcomings, their interference in our elections, &amp; destabilizing activities in Eastern Ukraine &amp; Syria. For President Trump to ignore these issues would be an abdication of his responsibilities.
That @realDonaldTrump is set to meet with Russian President Putin in Helsinki next month makes a mockery of history. It was in Helsinki in 1975 that 35 nations, including the Soviet Union, agreed to respect human rights &amp; basic freedoms of their people. https://t.co/w3DyGcKGGR
Americans see through the GOP’s misleading rhetoric &amp; they aren’t buying the trickle-down arguments. Dems will continue to highlight the broken promises of this #GOPTaxScam &amp; its damaging effects on our economy and on the American people.
When Republicans passed their #GOPTaxScam, they promised that for $1.8 trillion added to the debt, we would see unprecedented growth of 4%,5% or 6%---today’s BEA report shows GDP growth fell to just 2% in the first quarter. https://t.co/XAgoA0Ygkt
This vote puts @HouseGOP on record when it comes to the question of whether law enforcement agencies in our country ought to be able to perform their jobs independently and free from the taint of politics.
Today’s resolution, while unenforceable, is wholly inappropriate and a blatant attempt to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation. It is essential that Congress not meddle in an ongoing criminal investigation. https://t.co/i06h6SfqC3
Today on the Floor, House Dems are voting against another partisan attempt by @HouseGOP to undermine Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. The House is also voting on passage of the Fiscal Year 2019 funding bill for @DeptofDefense. https://t.co/iI8CvMe8QH

Happy birthday to my friend and the newest member of the House, @RepConorLamb. Thank you for your commitment to working families in #PA18 &amp; work to ensure every American has access to affordable, quality health care.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseAgDems Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit, @repdavidscott.
Justice #Kennedy has served our nation honorably on #SCOTUS &amp; I wish him well in retirement.   @SenateMajLdr said it was inappropriate to act on a SCOTUS nomination in an election year. Ahead of the election, he should abide by his own delayed process. https://t.co/FQXPa3xqTW

Thursday is the anniversary of #SCOTUS upholding the #ACA— a reminder that GOP is driving up the cost of health care &amp; undermining protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Dems will continue to hold them accountable for their attempts to undermine the law.
On reports that @HouseGOP may offer a narrow measure that would result in family detention, I said to press if the alternative to separating families is to keep them together but in an inhumane context, it’s not an alternative. #FamiliesBelongTogether
I told press today the migrants @RealDonaldTrump speaks so despairingly about are people fleeing for their lives, their safety &amp; their welfare. They’re asking for asylum. To characterize these folks as less than humans worthy of empathy is un-American. #FamiliesBelongTogether
At my weekly press conference I said Dems opposed the GOP’s anti-immigrant bill today because: -it does not #ProtectDREAMers -it does not solve the family separation crisis created by POTUS -it wastes 25 billion taxpayer $ on an ineffective border wall
.@RealDonaldTrump created these crises &amp; his actions are now making it harder for Congress to address them responsibly.  I urge POTUS to cease his unhelpful tweets &amp; call on @HouseGOP to work with Dems toward a workable, bipartisan solution to these challenges.
Democrats envision immigration policies that are smart, responsible, &amp; humane. That’s why we continue to be ready to work across the aisle to keep asylum-seeking families together &amp; to solve the DACA crisis in a way that is fair &amp; provides a pathway to citizenship.
Another partisan GOP immigration bill failed in the House. When will GOP leaders realize the path forward on immigration &amp; asylum reform must be a bipartisan one? When will they focus on policies recognizing the human aspect of our immigration challenges? https://t.co/u6xGoUAzuB
Dems will continue to fight for the rights of all workers – whether public or private sector – to organize &amp; bargain collectively for better pay &amp; benefits &amp; work environments.  I will keep working closely w organized labor to defend workers’ rights victories &amp; expand on them.
The #Janus decision today overturns forty years of precedent &amp; will undermine the ability of law enforcement officers, firefighters, teachers, &amp; other public servants to do their jobs &amp; earn the pay &amp; benefits they deserve while working in safe workplaces. https://t.co/PnEXopkJnG
At today’s press conference, I was pleased to introduce my friend and fellow Marylander @OlaOjewumi who spoke passionately about how Republicans are raising health care costs &amp; undermining coverage.

I thank @RepJoeCrowley for serving as a tireless fighter for jobs, opportunity &amp; a better future for the people of our country, and I wish him well.

.@USCBO confirms #GOPTaxScam will cause debt as a share of the economy to double by 2048, increasing the likelihood of a fiscal crisis. Again we see GOP’s blithe adherence to the mantra that tax cuts pay for themselves driving us toward fiscal catastrophe. https://t.co/qEqwgULzQB

As we recognize the 5-year anniversary of #SCOTUS striking down the discriminatory #DOMA, I join @HRC in calling for passage of the #EqualityAct to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity across key areas of life &amp; help move #EqualityForward.
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider one national resources bill and begin debate of a Fiscal Year 2019 funding bill for @DeptofDefense.  https://t.co/QJfaO6MElc
Together, we will continue to fight for justice, and I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues in the @LGBTEqCaucus to advance equality for all, including by passing the #EqualityAct to end discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
5 years ago today, #SCOTUS did more than strike down #DOMA– it struck a note of equality &amp; inclusion. Today, let us celebrate the hard-won victories in the march for equality &amp; draw strength from them as we seek further progress. https://t.co/WWOuAnu58T #LoveWins #EqualityForward
.@HouseGOP continues to stall when it comes to addressing our immigration &amp; asylum challenges.  Meanwhile, children remain separated from their parents with no plan for reunification, &amp; this GOP Congress’s fecklessness gives the Trump Admin a free hand to pursue extreme policies.
I thank @RepAdamSmith &amp; @RepJayapal for introducing the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act &amp; join as a co-sponsor to ensure that migrant families are neither separated nor mistreated. #FamiliesBelongTogether  https://t.co/Rq3W9pMFmw
In effect, this ruling will make it harder for women to access the care they seek.  Setbacks like this one mean that we must not relent in the fight to ensure every woman’s right to make her own health care choices and have access to the full range of care options.
Deeply disappointing that #NIFLAvBecerra decision will give unlicensed facilities a green light to mislead women about the health care services they provide.  No woman ought to be denied access to information about reproductive care options available. https://t.co/FBnRyZsb8x
We are calling on the Admin to appoint a federal official to serve as a point of contact to Members of Congress and provide daily status updates on these families and efforts to reunify them. Read the full letter here: https://t.co/9utPiKF81m #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/pcSUw65zC5
Joined @HispanicCaucus to demand answers from @TheJusticeDept, @HHSGov, &amp; @DHSGov on the status &amp; well-being of children separated from their parents at the border &amp; detained by the Trump Admin. We need to see a detailed plan for family reunification. https://t.co/zaBzTmXYug
I believe #SCOTUS got it wrong. @POTUS’ #MuslimBan will weaken our nation by denying talented immigrant workers &amp; job creators &amp; limiting opportunity for foreign businesspeople to invest in America. It also makes us less safe. I urge POTUS to end the ban. https://t.co/9rUUWFmDmh
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider twenty bills. https://t.co/FhNkg4HFTU
Five years after the Shelby County v. Holder #SCOTUS decision, Congress has the obligation to update the Voting Rights Act. I urge Republican leadership to bring legislation to the Floor to #RestoreTheVOTE &amp; ensure all Americans can exercise their most fundamental right. https://t.co/8ugJwrJpzR
Republicans promised workers they would see increased wages and benefits thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. Six months later, workers are seeing layoffs as a result of the law while wealthy shareholders reap the benefits. https://t.co/Vk8rhg7ZXh
Wishing a happy birthday to the Ranking Member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, @RepAdamSchiff.
6 months since #GOPTaxScam became law, I joined Americans affected by it to discuss how the promises that the GOP made are not coming to fruition. Instead, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, small biz owners are facing mounting uncertainty. https://t.co/7QivABnfnS https://t.co/vq1AoCSN1Q
On the six-month anniversary of the #GOPTaxScam, here’s a look at how the law is a giveaway to the wealthiest in America and corporations while leaving America’s small businesses, working families, &amp; older Americans behind. https://t.co/jH9Ait8DGI
Many of the opioid bills the House passed this week are an important first step, but GOP hypocrisy on this issue has been on full display with their efforts to take coverage away from Americans suffering from opioid addiction. https://t.co/lqgpCxYDFj
Today on the Floor, I called on @GOPLeader to put the bipartisan USA Act on the Floor for a vote. It’s time to let the People’s House work it’s will to #ProtectDREAMers and solve the crisis created by the Trump Administration’s family separation policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/tTMUo0YUPR
Congress has a responsibility to create a pathway to citizenship for #DREAMers &amp; ensure children are reunited w their families. That’s what Dems are committed to doing &amp; will continue to work toward, no matter how long the GOP kicks the can down the road. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Legislation on immigration is not, as @POTUS &amp; many of his allies in Congress believe, a waste of time.  Those who care about our nation’s #DREAMers, families fleeing violence, &amp; national security must come together without delay, no matter what POTUS is tweeting, to take action.
For months @RealDonaldTrump has called on Congress to solve the #DACA crisis that he created &amp; days ago he called on Congress to solve the family separation crisis he created – but today he has decided that it’s a waste of time.  https://t.co/ehVtvA89WQ
The President’s daughter &amp; Senior Advisor Ivanka Trump is donating funds to aid the migrant children separated from their parents because of her father’s policy. It would have been better if @RealDonaldTrump had not created the crisis in the first place. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Muneer Baig, Founder &amp; CEO of SYSUSA, joined Dems today to discuss how the #GOPTaxScam is a huge handout to large corporations while small businesses like his struggle with mounting uncertainty.
.@RepMcEachin knows firsthand the challenges of owning a small business. I thank him for joining us today to discuss how the #GOPTaxScam adds to the complexity and uncertainty small businesses face.
Donna Cywinski’s son has a pre-existing condition and fears his premiums will skyrocket as a result of the #GOPTaxScam, which undermines the #ACA. Thanks to Donna for telling her story today. We’ll continue to hold the GOP accountable for increasing health care costs.
I thank @CongressmanRuiz for joining me today to discuss the #GOPTaxScam &amp; its impact on health care costs. By undermining the #ACA, the tax law will mean skyrocketing health care costs &amp; loss of coverage for many Americans.
Today, John Glaser is joining House Dems to discuss how the #GOPTaxScam is a bad deal for American families &amp; hurts seniors like him on Medicare. I agree with him that seniors should not have to live in fear of being unable to afford their health care.
Thank you @JanSchakowsky for joining today’s press conference on the #GOPTaxScam &amp; discussing how the law undermines the sustainability of Medicare &amp; Social Security. We must protect these programs for current &amp; future generations.
The more time passes &amp; Americans learn what’s in the #GOPTaxScam, the more unpopular it becomes. Dems will continue to hold the GOP accountable for their vote to raise taxes on the middle class, kick millions off health coverage, &amp; make the tax code more confusing for small biz.
Today, we are joined by a small biz owner who will discuss how the #GOPTaxScam has created more uncertainty &amp; complexity for his company; a mom who is facing the prospect of skyrocketing health costs; &amp; a senior concerned by how the law undermines Medicare.
.@HouseGOP said all Americans would be better off under the #GOPTaxScam, but, six months later, we know that’s not true for many middle-class Americans.
Republicans promised that companies would use their tax cuts from the #GOPTaxScam to hire more workers and raise wages, but many companies are laying off workers &amp; many more are using their tax cut to enrich investors through stock buybacks.
Republicans promised that American workers would see a $4,000 raise thanks to the #GOPTaxScam, but wages are falling. They said that families struggling from paycheck to paycheck would see real relief, but rising health care &amp; gas costs are eating up more of their paychecks.
Six months after the #GOPTaxScam, none of the promises that Republicans made are coming to fruition.
The #GOPTaxScam will cause taxes to go up for 86 million middle-class households and give 83% of the tax cuts to the top 1% of Americans.
Six months ago, Congressional Republicans passed a hastily written #GOPTaxScam law that adds $1.8 trillion to the deficit to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest. The bill came to the Floor without hearings, testimony, &amp;, very frankly, without proofreading.
My staff will tweet during today’s press conference on the #GOPTaxScam’s impact on middle-class families, small biz owners, &amp; seniors. Follow along here using the hashtag #GOPTaxScam
On the 6 month anniv of the #GOPTaxScam, I’m w @NancyPelosi, @JanSchakowsky, @CongressmanRuiz, @RepMcEachin &amp; Americans impacted to discuss how it is leaving small biz behind, raising health care costs, &amp; making retirement less secure. Tune in: https://t.co/MU2UYdnHRQ
Quick refresher: 1. You created this #DACA crisis &amp; asked Congress to “do your job” &amp; pass a bill. 2. Democrats have offered multiple bipartisan proposals to #ProtectDREAMers. 3. You’ve rejected every single one. You can’t take yes for an answer. https://t.co/HyrO9JXNSA

At today’s #GOPBudget markup, @HouseBudgetDems Member @RepJeffries is offering an amendment to restore the #SALT deduction that the #GOPTaxScam capped to raise taxes on millions of Americans. #BrighterForBillionaires https://t.co/yvc68e5sda
I thank @RepLujanGrisham for offering an amdt to end @RealDonaldTrump’s family separation policy at the #GOPBudget mark up today. #FamiliesBelongTogether &amp; @HouseBudgetGOP ought to join Dems in voting to end this cruel policy.  #BrighterForBillionaires https://t.co/GsDciS8z0B
Today, @RepDelBene gave Congressional Republicans the opportunity to protect vital nutrition assistance programs instead of slashing them as their #GOPBudget seeks to do. #BrighterForBillionaires #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/FbdyVBwqYG
Our nation values families, &amp; we must not abide by these practices within our borders or in our name. We must reject this latest effort by @POTUS to use migrant children as bargaining chips. I urge @SpeakerRyan to bring @RepJerryNadler’s #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to the Floor now.
For weeks @realDonaldTrump claimed only Congress could end this merciless policy. Today’s executive order is an admission both that he lied to America &amp; his attempt to hold children hostage has failed because of Americans’ outrage.
.@POTUS’s executive order does not resolve the crisis of his own making. It essentially switches from a system of separate detention camps for parents &amp; children to one where families are inhumanely detained together indefinitely. https://t.co/zs8lH4qQmv #FamiliesBelongTogether
I’m joining @NPRATC shortly to discuss @RealDonaldTrump’s merciless policy of separating migrant children from their parents. Be sure to tune in. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepDonBeyer. Thank you for your leadership to our protect oceans, coastlines, and waterways as co-chair of the @CaucusOnClimate.
There is no law mandating the separation of migrant children from their parents. It is a bold-faced lie for the President to claim otherwise.  He can and must end this crisis now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/tAxN7mCm10
Thank you Senator McCain for speaking out against @realDonaldTrump’s merciless policy of ripping migrant children away from their parents. RT if you agree @POTUS must end this policy immediately. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/PB1A7WfsVz
Once again, @HouseBudgetGOP is relying on budget gimmicks &amp; short changing America’s working families with severe cuts to Medicare and Social Security. The #GOPBudget makes the future #BrighterForBillionares, not the middle class. https://t.co/7jDmkrMYa4
Exactly 6 months after passing the #GOPTaxScam that explodes the deficit, @HouseBudgetGOP is marking up their #BrighterForBillionaires budget, which pays for tax cuts for the wealthy by cutting health care, retirement security, &amp; education. #GOPBudget https://t.co/oJx4TYRmu7
I agree with former First Lady Laura Bush that @RealDonaldTrump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents is both cruel and immoral.  President Trump, this is your policy, and I urge you to end it now because #FamiliesBelongTogether. https://t.co/0z2a98XaI2
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will vote on two bills related to the #opioid crisis. https://t.co/sBKVlsm0gi
.@AmerAcadPeds is speaking out against @RealDonaldTrump’s family separation policy, which they call “government-sanctioned child abuse.”   @POTUS, it’s time to end this policy now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UrceRSB7MU
As Republicans attempt to sell their unpopular #GOPTaxScam six months after final passage, I thank @RepMaxineWaters &amp; @FSCDems for speaking out on behalf of middle-class Americans left behind by the law. https://t.co/409JWDK3YH
This #Juneteenth, proud to stand with @OfficialCBC to fight against racism &amp; discrimination, stand up for the principle that every African American’s life matters, &amp; that he or she ought to be able to pursue every opportunity the U.S. offers – including the right to vote.
As we mark #Juneteenth, let us remember the horrors of slavery &amp; segregation that followed.

Democrats strongly oppose the anti-immigrant bills on the Floor this week – the Goodlatte proposal &amp; @SpeakerRyan’s bill. Read this @AmProg column on how they fail to end family separation at the border &amp; would hurt women and children: https://t.co/cACIKXwgSq
I join my colleagues as a co-sponsor of @RepJerryNadler’s #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to end the Trump Admin’s inhumane policy of separating migrant children from their parents. I urge @SpeakerRyan to bring this bill to the Floor now. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/66mF34nokz https://t.co/nXGriVvqLY
I urge @HouseGOP to stop using the budget process for political messaging &amp; start working across the aisle to tackle the serious fiscal challenges we face – &amp; that their dangerous &amp; flawed policies have exacerbated.
The budget unveiled by @HouseBudgetGOP today, 65 days overdue, cannot be considered a serious effort. It uses budget gimmicks, while putting deficit reduction on the backs of the most vulnerable, even after adding $1.8T to the deficit w the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/VOlaubGzxa
This is a lie. @RealDonaldTrump this is your policy, and you have the power to end it.  #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/bk54Bg9GWO
Separating families at the border is cruel &amp; inhumane. 327 #MD05 residents have called or written my office expressing outrage w/ the Trump Admin's policy while just 6 support it. I urge @POTUS to listen to the majority of Americans &amp; end this policy now. #FamiliesBelongTogether
After GOP failed to overcome broad opposition to repeal the #ACA, @Heritage &amp; the extreme wing of @HouseGOP are trying again to take health coverage away from millions, eliminate protections for pre-ex conditions, impose an age tax, &amp; threaten Medicare. https://t.co/rkaRIHZq3u
4. And the bill – along with the Goodlatte legislation – has no chance of being signed into law. The process for bringing these bills to the Floor guarantees that Congress does not solve the #DACA crisis.
3. The bill includes harsh limits on legal immigration, including ending the diversity visa program and family reunification, which has already been rejected in the Senate.
2. Despite GOP claims, immigration experts have confirmed the bill will not end the Trump Administration’s merciless policy of separating children from their parents at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether
1. The bill wastes $25 billion on @RealDonaldTrump’s ineffective border wall.  Both Republicans in Congress and members of the Trump Administration have spoken out against the wall as an ineffective &amp; wasteful measure.
For months, @SpeakerRyan promised to solve the #DACA crisis. Now, he is bringing 2 partisan proposals to the Floor, including Ryan’s “compromise” bill, which is really no compromise at all: https://t.co/C6AIBceZe2
This week marks 6 months after the #GOPTaxScam was signed, &amp; this @TaxFoundation map shows just how dramatically the law cuts taxes for the top 1% of Americans while leaving the middle class behind: https://t.co/2ALQZZmnmA https://t.co/lebA6AV3yM
.@POTUS, #FamiliesBelongTogether. It is shameful that Blanca hasn’t spoken to her 8 year old, Abel, in 2 months because of your policy that is separating migrant children from their parents. I urge you to rescind this policy. https://t.co/qrFvzSCesO
I join @AppropsDems in calling for a hearing &amp; answers from the Trump Admin on how they are using federal funds to separate migrant children from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether &amp; Dems will continue to demand that this Admin reverse its policy. https://t.co/MqSp1GsFBO
Happy birthday to my good friend, @RepJimCooper. Thank you for your commitment to addressing our nation’s fiscal health &amp; to bipartisan solutions as a member of @HouseBlueDogs.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepPeteAguilar. Thank you for your leadership and work to solve the #DACA crisis and find a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers.
The junk plan rule announced today is a blatant effort to sabotage the #ACA &amp; will undermine consumer protections for millions of small biz owners &amp; their employees, increase premiums across the board, &amp; result in 130K more uninsured Americans by 2022. https://t.co/u46vw4gdFL
I am at a loss for words.   @SpeakerRyan, @HouseGOP, have you heard this recording?   I urge you to demand that the President end this cruel, inhumane policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/i2kZRxBTSD
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider 18 bipartisan bills. Several are aimed at addressing the #opioid crisis. https://t.co/FF9u58jO2N
Separating migrant children from their parents is cruel, inhumane, &amp; morally bankrupt.   #FamiliesBelongTogether, and @RealDonaldTrump has the power to direct @DHSgov to stop this policy it its tracks.  It is well past time he do so. https://t.co/NCzutEcT9m
I also told reporters that ahead of the 6 month anniversary of the #GOPTaxScam, a majority of Americans continue to oppose the law because it blows a hole in the deficit, increases premiums for working families, undermines Medicare &amp; leaves small biz owners facing uncertainty.
I also said to reporters that @HouseBudgetGOP will mark up a budget tomorrow, but I do not think it will make it to the Floor for a vote. After passing the deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam, they can’t come up with a budget in an honest way.
I also said to press today that @RealDonaldTrump’s policy of separating migrant parents &amp; children is not consistent with our nation’s values, morality, or faiths. @POTUS has the ability to end this policy and ought to now. #FamiliesBelongTogether
When speaking with reporters this morning, I said Democrats will oppose the Goodlatte proposal and @SpeakerRyan’s bill, which is not a real effort to address #DACA. This is a process that ducks the issue and is designed to fail.
Appreciate Republican &amp; Democratic governors speaking out against the Trump Administration’s efforts to undo protections for 133 million Americans with pre-existing condition. I agree that the Admin's decision will hurt families &amp; must be reversed. https://t.co/Xn1Ylhwz37 https://t.co/ELVXRnDxEz
.@RealDonaldTrump is separating children for the sole purpose of trying to build his wall and cease much of the legal immigration that has always made America great.  Shame on him.  Shame on all of us if we do not come together to stop it. #KeepFamiliesTogether
President Trump’s claim that this is a Democratic policy is a bold-faced lie. The American people must not be confused about what is taking place here: @POTUS has ordered children be torn from their parents’ arms, assigned numbers, &amp; held in what have been described as cages.
.@realDonaldTrump’s remarks today on family separation were tone deaf &amp; displayed a profound misunderstanding about what this country is about. There is precisely one individual who holds the fate of these children &amp; parents in his hands, &amp; that is @POTUS. https://t.co/Os9Wcz9I92
Pleased to support the CARE Act, which would help ensure communities in MD have access to the resources they need to address the opioid crisis. I thank @RepCummings for introducing this important legislation. https://t.co/L5dM83RSfi https://t.co/cSxWOrD1Ns
It’s nearly six months since @POTUS signed the #GOPtaxscam into law, and the American people still aren’t buying what Republicans are desperately trying to sell. Why? Because they know it’s a windfall for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/Zf7DiR9q2V

Happy birthday to my friend, @RepRickLarsen. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member of @TransportDems’ Subcommittee on Aviation.
Joined House Dems &amp; #DREAMers today to commemorate the 6th anniversary of #DACA.   283 days ago @POTUS abruptly ended DACA &amp; challenged Congress to act. But @HouseGOP refuses to let the House work its will. We must act now to #protectDREAMers. https://t.co/tRivIJtyN7 https://t.co/4UIBnbw93Y
Under the leadership of @EPAScottPruit, the Trump Admin has sought to severely cut funding to improve the health of the #ChesapeakeBay. The Bay is critical to the livelihood of communities throughout MD &amp; we must do all that we can to ensure its health for generations to come.
Encouraging to see the health of the #ChesapeakeBay continues to improve. It’s important now more than ever that Congress continues to oppose efforts by the Trump Administration to defund programs that #ProtectOurBay. https://t.co/vnrHhTcGv6
I’m troubled by @USOCC Otting’s refusal to acknowledge discrimination in the U.S. The Admin ought to support the Equal Credit Opportunity Act—a critical tool to combat discrimination against protected classes in the financial services industry. #OCCnoColor https://t.co/kTQ4BAO0IJ
On Fridays, @GOPLeader &amp; I normally speak on the Floor about the schedule for the week ahead.  Today, he canceled because I suspect Republicans do not know the schedule or have a plan to address #DACA.   It’s time to let the People’s House work its will &amp; #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/uBHrGlqGGP
Today on the Floor, the House will vote on a GOP bill that seeks to incarcerate Americans instead of putting resources into treatment centers for opioid addiction &amp; educating families &amp; individuals impacted on how to help their loved ones. https://t.co/taSD0B77oX

Thank you all for the kind birthday wishes today. Pleased to celebrate my birthday cheering on the Democrats at tonight’s #CongressionalBaseballGame! Go Dems! #CBG18
.@HouseGOP’s immigration bill unveiled by @SpeakerRyan is no compromise at all. It is an anti-immigrant bill, simply put. Democrats will oppose it because it is a pretense for addressing this crisis with a guarantee that it won’t. https://t.co/B9sdPdxvrA
The FBI &amp; special counsel ought to be allowed to carry out their investigations unimpeded &amp; Congress ought to take steps to protect Mueller’s investigation so that the American people can learn the truth.
While the report identifies a number of ways the FBI and Justice Department could have done better, it concludes that there was no political motivation.
.@POTUS continues to try to undermine Americans’ independent law enforcement institutions to defend himself against the special counsel’s investigation.  Today’s #IGReport and the GOP reaction to it are the latest in that effort. https://t.co/O7MvqTeQrb #WeDemandTheTruth

For months – 281 days to be exact – @SpeakerRyan has promised to address the #DACA crisis created by @POTUS. Instead, he has refused to let the House work its will on bipartisan proposals. Here’s a review of the promises Speaker Ryan made:  https://t.co/Zgfq4HTHT6
The GOP is continuing their stealth attack on the #ACA &amp; benefits it has provided for millions of Americans.

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Ranking Member on @HouseJudDems, @RepJerryNadler.
Instead of allowing the House to work its will &amp; vote on a bipartisan compromise bill to address the #DACA crisis &amp; end uncertainty for #DREAMers, @SpeakerRyan continues to dissemble &amp; delay. Now, he offers vague promises on bills he knows will not pass. https://t.co/TgCWKfafEL
Over 130 MILLION Americans with pre-existing conditions are protected under the ACA. Last week, the Trump Administration announced that it wants to take away those vital protections. #ProtectOurCare Tune in here at 12 noon ET: https://t.co/jFTKqWYZIn
.@SpeakerRyan's vague promise to bring a #DACA bill to the Floor is a pretend attempt to appear that he is addressing this crisis when he is not. I urge him to allow the House to proceed with the "Queen of the Hill" process that a majority would support. https://t.co/TgCWKeSENd
This is not who we are as a people, &amp; Americans will surely never abide such treatment of innocent children in their name.  President Trump &amp; Attorney General Sessions should stop separating migrant families in the first place. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/pMFEdSI3cW
It is horrifying that the Trump Admin is not only prying young children from their parents’ arms but also considering placing them in tent cities. The Administration should abandon these plans immediately.  https://t.co/pDLSIyLiPO

Finally, I told reporters I continue to be hopeful we can get to 218 signatures on the #DACA discharge petition today. @SpeakerRyan promised months ago that he would bring a bill to the Floor to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; still doesn't have a bill. We should move fwd with the petition.
I also told press that the Trump Admin’s refusal to defend the #ACA is more evidence the GOP is doing everything in their power to undermine the law. Their attempt to gut the law could result in over 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions losing coverage.
I said to press that the #TrumpKimSummit was a made-for-TV visual that lacked substance, which is even more troubling after the President alienated historic allies that share our values at the G7.
I told reporters this morning that it’s appropriate for Congress to take steps to address the opioid epidemic, but the rule bills on the Floor do not make significant investments in addiction treatment.

I've spent many years trying to ensure that every eligible voter can cast a ballot &amp; have that ballot counted accurately. While decisions like today’s frustrate this effort, Dems will keep up this fight as long as it takes to ensure that every American’s right to vote is secured.
Disappointed by today’s ruling in #HustedvAPRI. The decision is a setback for #votingrights &amp; sends a dangerous signal to GOP-led states that they can disenfranchise voters through purges, which disproportionately affect minorities &amp; working families. https://t.co/qc1WLJSle9
Thank you @RepJayapal for lifting up the stories of families who are being torn apart by @DHSgov’s policy of separating children from parents who are seeking asylum in the United States. This policy is inflicting unspeakable harm and must be reversed. https://t.co/ZYC4uEznju

55 years ago today, President Kennedy signed the #EqualPayAct into law. While we have made progress, women still only earn an average of $0.80 to a man’s dollar &amp; the wage gap for minority women is even larger.  This is both unjust &amp; economically harmful. https://t.co/RU7ilHs2xR https://t.co/vm2IyqYTEg

Democrats will continue to fight Republican attempts to undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act and to sabotage Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care.

The GOP’s rescissions package is a shameless attempt to gloss over the $1.8 trillion they added to the deficit as a result of the #GOPTaxScam.  Today, I asked if they are planning to bring 1,800 more bills like this to the Floor to fully cover the cost of their tax law. https://t.co/F6EbkI3o4r

I urge Republicans in Congress &amp; @RealDonaldTrump to cease their efforts to undermine health care in America &amp; work with Democrats to safeguard Medicare &amp; Social Security for the next generation.
Alarmed Medicare will become insolvent in 2026, 3 yrs earlier than previously projected, &amp; Social Security will become insolvent in 2034 – due largely to #GOPTaxScam &amp; slower long-term economic growth. Both speak directly to the failures of GOP policies.  https://t.co/0YfWkbwyWJ
The real heart of the case against POTUS’ rescissions package is that none of his proposals have come close to addressing even in small part the enormous deficits incurred from the #GOPTaxScam. The new rescissions package proposed today is, like its predecessor, a sham.
The Trump Administration seems to be doing the best job at making the argument against its own rescissions proposal.  Their updated package directly undercuts its case that money it proposed for rescission would never be spent anyway. https://t.co/uKFB0JgJw7
At today’s press conf, I told reporters about the Pathways #OutOfPoverty #ListeningTour I led last week w @RepBarbaraLee. We toured sites in #Dallas with @RepVeasey &amp; @RepEBJ to hear directly from Americans living in poverty &amp; stakeholders who are working to alleviate poverty.
I also told press that @SpeakerRyan has promised to bring #DACA legislation to the Floor for months and has failed to do so. The discharge petition would allow consideration of 4 bills, including a proposal by the Speaker. How much fairer can a process be?
Today, I told the press that I oppose the process and the policy in the minibus appropriations bill that Republicans are bringing to the Floor this week. By packaging bills together, it limits debate and sets up gotcha votes. The bill also includes several problematic provisions.
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider seven bills. https://t.co/hY2X1CcivZ

From the beginning to now, the dealings with #NorthKorea have been sophomoric &amp; w/o strategic or tactical merit. While #NorthKorea’s history has shown them to be untrustworthy &amp; duplicitous, this Admin’s actions have heightened the danger posed by North Korea’s reckless behavior.
The President’s letter to North Korea is a sad example of the petulance &amp; shallowness of the foreign policy being pursued by @POTUS. It is another demonstration of POTUS’ treating of critical negotiations as if they were just another real estate deal. https://t.co/3JswF0SrDn

The American people will not be fooled; they can see Republicans’ sabotage of our health care system for what it is. I call on Republicans to stop recklessly sabotaging the #ACA, which undermines insurance markets &amp; harms consumers, &amp; instead work with us to strengthen the law.
.@USCBO confirms GOP sabotage of the #ACA is raising Americans’ premiums &amp; kicking them off coverage. By their estimation, premiums will go up an average of 15% &amp; 3M Americans will lose coverage next year due to the GOP’s work to undermine the law. https://t.co/b0dlxbEB7s

If @HouseGOP want to continue to focus a national conversation on their unpopular #GOPTaxScam, that helps big corporations over small businesses, that's their choice. Dems will continue to highlight GOP’s prioritizing of the wealthiest over those working hard every day to get by.
As a result of a more-complicated tax code that came out of Republicans’ rush to pass their bill with no hearings or full debate, small businesses are facing deep uncertainty over how the law applies to them and what its impact will be.
While today’s hearing is an attempt to claim that small businesses will flourish, every outside analysis shows that the #GOPTaxScam overwhelmingly advantages multinational corporations while ignoring small businesses on Main Streets across America.
Once again, @WaysandMeansGOP seems to believe that they can rebrand their #GOPTaxScam that advantages the wealthy over the middle class with a Congressional hearing today packed with cherry-picked witnesses.  https://t.co/xH8Z80IuuT
Republicans promised Americans that their #GOPTaxScam would raise wages &amp; create jobs.  The reality?  Businesses are taking their tax cut, rewarding shareholders, closing factories, &amp; moving jobs overseas.  This is yet another example of the law leaving American workers behind. https://t.co/V2pv442qUc

Today, the House will vote on the #GOPFarmBill, which is facing opposition from all sides of the political spectrum, including conservative groups. Read more about Republicans’ deep divisions over the bill here: https://t.co/eS5mMIDLVM https://t.co/TfKb6XuLk7
OPM’s report on official time is another targeted attack by the Trump Administration on the federal civilian workforce. Official time saves taxpayer money and is to the benefit of thousands of employees throughout the federal government. https://t.co/zZpAb5aTCL
I thank @RepMarciaFudge for joining today’s forum on the Kerner Report &amp; for her commitment to finding solutions to address poverty in our communities.
Thank you for joining today’s forum on poverty &amp; for your continued commitment to fighting racial injustice and economic inequalities in MI and across the country, @RepLawrence.
I appreciate that my friend, @NormaJTorres, joined today’s forum on poverty. Thank you for your commitment to addressing racial inequality &amp; work to alleviate poverty in America.
Pleased my friend &amp; a lifelong leader the fight for civil rights, @Clyburn, could join today’s hearing on progress we’ve made and challenges that remain after the Kerner Report. https://t.co/dUd3nLFwXM
My friend @RepHankJohnson spoke passionately this afternoon about racism &amp; inequality in our society at today’s forum 50 years after the Kerner Report.
Thanks @RepEBJ for joining today’s forum on poverty &amp; discussing how Congress can address systemic racial and economic inequality in America today. We’ll continue this discussion when I visit your district in a couple of weeks.
Thank you to my friend, @RepGwenMoore, for helping us lead today’s forum on poverty &amp; economic inequalities. I look forward to visiting your district later this summer to continue to discuss these issues with your constituents. https://t.co/5hfAqWHRsP
I appreciated the remarks and questions from @OfficialCBC Chairman @RepRichmond at today’s forum examining persistent economic challenges plaguing the African-American community and how we can address them. https://t.co/BhGdJZ6B5H
Thank you to the Chair of the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, &amp; Opportunity, @RepBarbaraLee, for convening today’s forum on poverty and racial inequities today. https://t.co/Qug0vBKt4n
I thank @edworkforcedems Ranking Member @BobbyScott &amp; @HouseJudDems Ranking Member @RepJerryNadler for introducing a resolution, which I’m proud to co-sponsor, to affirm support for enforcement of Title VI under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in U.S. schools.
Joined my colleagues on the anniversary of #BrownvBoard to discuss enforcement of the Civil Rights Act in U.S. schools. It is unacceptable that K-12 schools continue to struggle w segregation &amp; disparities in the treatment of minority students. https://t.co/pql5sxY3nT #Brownat64 https://t.co/7PtEkmY6tq
I also appreciated the personal testimony of Tianna Gaines-Turner, a member of @Witnesses_Natl, who spoke at today’s forum about her experience as a mother raising children in poverty. https://t.co/2wogGXmaqN https://t.co/bLb65McqUz
Thank you to Valerie Wilson for testifying about @EconomicPolicy's work to examine racial &amp; economic disparities &amp; presenting policy ideas to address disparity in the black community.  https://t.co/81uaIKirtx https://t.co/nQNw2l2Qt0
At today’s forum, we also heard testimony from Dedrick Asante-Muhammad with @prosperitynow, who discussed the racial wage gap &amp; the #GOPTaxScam’s role in exacerbating economic disparities. https://t.co/DoiPUyz7q7 https://t.co/T8cJYpBtAl
Today, the Dem Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, &amp; Opportunity was grateful to hear from former Sen. Fred Harris, who spoke about poverty &amp; racial injustice that endures 50 yrs after the Kerner Report. https://t.co/KohKujEdqq https://t.co/PCt23ENsYq

Today, I spoke on the House Floor in honor of Richard “Richie” Collins III, who was killed nearly one year ago in an act of hate. As we remember his life, we must do more to combat the spread of hatred by spreading tolerance and respect, instead. https://t.co/wF9cag0Vqq
Today, the House is considering the #GOPFarmBill that cuts vital nutrition assistance, which I strongly oppose. It is unacceptable that over 250k students could lose access to school meals under the GOP plan. #ProtectSNAP https://t.co/ZotN3OWt7T
We are very fortunate to have former Senator Fred Harris, an author of the report 50 years ago. I look forward to hearing his observations from 1968 to what we’re dealing with today &amp; his best practices to address challenges we face.
Today, as we look at the Kerner Commission Report, and what has transpired since, I hope we will think about ways to learn from that experience &amp; find innovative ways to address poverty &amp; racial bias moving forward.
In urban, rural, and suburban parts of this country, dire poverty continues to strain the cohesion of American society. We’ve also seen inherent bias continues to exacerbate stubborn disparities in justice, equality, &amp; opportunity.
They recognized the root of civil disorder, was poverty &amp; deep racial biases that perpetuate it. Five decades later, we are here to take stock of the progress made &amp; where our nation has fell short.
Fifty years ago, President Johnson convened the Kerner Commission to address rioting in cities &amp; the commission released a landmark report. A bipartisan group of leaders laid out observations &amp; recommendations.
I would like to thank both the Chair of the Dem Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, &amp; Opportunity, @RepBarbaraLee &amp; @OfficialCBC Charman, @RepRichmond for joining &amp; co-hosting today’s forum.
As I give opening remarks, my staff will live tweet. Be sure to follow along through this handle, @RepBarbaraLee, &amp; @OfficialCBC.
Right now, the Dem Whip Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, &amp; Opportunity &amp; @OfficialCBC are kicking off our “50 Years After the Kerner Report” forum &amp; hearing from experts on how to address poverty, injustice, &amp; economic inequalities. Tune in: https://t.co/MqDoaajmt5

Immigrants are people who, like us &amp; our ancestors, are seeking a better life &amp; a chance to #MakeItInAmerica &amp; our immigration policies should reflect that. I continue to urge @POTUS &amp; his Admin to recognize that &amp; the significant contributions that immigrants make to our nation.
.@RealDonaldTrump’s comments yesterday regarding immigrants reveal the malice with which he regards people unlike himself. By dehumanizing immigrants, he is trying to justify the kind of inhumane treatment to which his Administration is subjecting them. https://t.co/8hN8wZIyJH

The #GOPtaxscam is failing to live up to the promises Republicans made.   Republicans know it. And so do the American people.   Here’s another look at how the law is playing out nearly six months after its enactment: https://t.co/09fsTD8Gx1

Republicans told American families that they would see increases in their paychecks thanks to the #GOPTaxScam, but a majority of families aren’t seeing the increase. Instead, the law’s benefits are lining the pockets of wealthy investors. https://t.co/zUwxaHNRfT https://t.co/b0vT0QTnPF
The Senate Intel Cmte got it right in validating the intel agencies’ conclusions that the Russian govt sought to help the Trump campaign &amp; hurt the Clinton campaign. This is an issue of rule of law &amp; national security &amp; must supersede partisan interest. https://t.co/3HGYlMEgbg

Republicans sold their #GOPTaxScam on the promise that the law would create jobs. Yet, nearly six months into this tax law and a vast majority of employers have no plans to hire workers or raise wages. Read more about the GOP’s broken promises here: https://t.co/zUwxaHNRfT https://t.co/b6VO9z1Tay
Today, @WaysandMeansGOP held a hearing on their dangerous #GOPTaxScam as many of their own Members have stopped trying to sell it.  I thank @WaysMeansCmte for using the hearing to reveal the truth about the law’s negative impact on working families. https://t.co/nKKKnTQ3nm
At today’s @WaysandMeansGOP hearing, Chairman Brady cited a @USCBO report on the #GOPTaxScam that he says confirms the law would increase revenues. Here’s what the report actually says: https://t.co/sgSuQwC30K
Almost a full 6 months after the #GOPTaxScam was signed into law, the @WaysandMeansGOP Committee just held their first hearing on the law’s impact on the economy.   And according to economists, it doesn’t look like much. https://t.co/zUwxaHNRfT https://t.co/NA4Jje37Q6
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepDwightEvans. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to ensuring all working families in #PA02 can #MakeItInAmerica as Ranking Member on @HouseSBCDems’ Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access.
As @WaysandMeansGOP holds their first hearing on the #GOPTaxScam, here’s a reminder that this law isn’t creating jobs in the U.S. Instead, it makes it easier to send American jobs overseas. https://t.co/zUwxaHNRfT https://t.co/qhP415Wx8R
Former @USCBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin has said before that tax cuts don’t pay for themselves. At this morning’s @WaysandMeansGOP hearing, he was asked again by @RepSandyLevin whether the GOP tax law pays for itself. Take a look at the exchange: https://t.co/h1zKV897MI

This week marks the 1 year anniversary of the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller; since then there have been 22 indictments &amp; 5 guilty pleas. President Trump and Republicans in Congress continue to undermine the investigation. Congress must act to protect the Special Counsel.
I also told reporters that it’s ironic that @HouseGOP will hold its very first hearing on the #GOPTaxScam six months after it was signed into law. The legislation has failed to increase economic activity, grow jobs, or increase wages: https://t.co/zUwxaHNRfT
Today, I told press that I am disappointed in @HouseGOP’s partisan #FarmBill, which faces opposition from both sides of the aisle, doesn’t support rural development, and cuts SNAP.
Proud to join my friend &amp; former Orlando Police Chief @RepValDemings &amp; her husband, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, this morning at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service. #PoliceWeek2018 https://t.co/p02BOLFZTY

.@USCBO’s analysis of @HouseGOP’s rescission package shows it for the charade it is. For every dollar rescinded by this package, Republicans added nearly $2,000 to deficits in voting for their #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/OMUu02Korx

The #GOPTaxScam is lining the pockets of wealthy investors – not working Americans. A look at consumer spending shows middle-class families aren’t benefiting the way that Republicans promised: https://t.co/aQh5LWkWb9
Instead of working w Dems to support America’s farmers &amp; address food insecurity, @HouseGOP is moving fwd with a partisan #FarmBill. But their deep divisions are on display as they struggle to find votes &amp; conservative groups are speaking against the bill: https://t.co/eS5mMIDLVM https://t.co/aS1i5Glm40
This rescissions package is a political gimmick &amp; ought to be treated as such. Instead of trying to hide their deficit-incurring tax law behind the curtain of rescission, GOP ought to work with Democrats to identify bipartisan ways to make our fiscal situation more sustainable.
It is laughable that the same @HouseGOP who wrote the #GOPTaxScam which added $1.8T to the deficit in Dec would think the American people will see them as agents of fiscal responsibility now because they wish to cut $15B, w more than half from #CHIP &amp; #ACA https://t.co/kpDaF4IsDp
#Israel has every right to defend itself against attacks from across its borders, &amp; its actions were justified. U.S. policy must be that any political settlement to the Syrian civil war must not ensconce Iranian forces or allow access to Israel’s border. https://t.co/2fhWXfMa85

Congress has yet to see a concrete strategy from @RealDonaldTrump as to how he intends to avoid giving Mr. Kim a propaganda victory without securing the kind of verifiable commitment on denuclearization necessary for any summit to be a success.

Americans want Congress to tackle deficits and put our nation’s finances in order. We must do it in a way that doesn’t prevent us from investing in our people and the opportunities that enable them to make it in America.
After ballooning deficits to over a trillion dollars a year for the next decade with their #GOPTaxScam, Republicans cannot be taken seriously when they claim that we need to cut $15 billion from key programs in the name of fiscal responsibility.
That more than half of the $15 billion they propose to rescind would come out of funding for the bipartisan #CHIP program &amp; the Affordable Care Act shows that this is about political messaging instead of a real concern for working families or fiscal discipline.
The rescissions package proposed by the @WhiteHouse &amp; Congressional Republicans is another example of their hypocritical attitude toward deficits. https://t.co/tMdCtMnu4J
When speaking with press this morning, I said even @RubioPress agrees: the #GOPTaxScam isn’t helping American workers. It’s another way the GOP advantages the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. https://t.co/yll5C7XsUf
.@OfficialCBC: I’ve supported robust funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program because it is crucial for law enforcement to know &amp; participate in their communities. What other programs should we be funding to ensure safety of citizens &amp; law enforcement?
I also said to press that the House GOP is deeply divided on their partisan #FarmBill. Instead of working on a bipartisan bill, GOP leadership has once again shown partisanship is the primary motivator of their actions.
Today, when speaking with reporters I discussed how Republicans’ actions to sabotage the #ACA are raising Americans’ health care costs &amp; kicking Americans off coverage. Read more about it here: https://t.co/D1QzJw25La

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepHanabusa. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member on @NRDems Subcommittee on Federal Lands.
Dems are committed to defending the #ACA, &amp; fighting to restore the protections and cost-saving provisions that Republicans and the President have sabotaged.  All Americans deserve access to quality, affordable health care, and we won’t rest until every American has that access.
Though they were unsuccessful in enacting their dangerous bill, Republicans have spent the past year working with the Trump Administration to sabotage health care access. They’ve driven up premiums &amp; will cause 13 million Americans to lose coverage through their #GOPTaxScam.
One year ago today, @HouseGOP voted to take health coverage away from 24 million Americans, including 7 million covered through their employers, &amp; raise premiums and out-of-pocket costs for patients &amp; their families through #TrumpCare. https://t.co/1dk4TDbami

Happy birthday to my friend, @RepRobinKelly. Thank you for your tireless commitment &amp; leadership to #EndGunViolence.
An overwhelming majority of Americans – regardless of political affiliation – support bipartisan action to #ProtectDREAMers. Retweet if you agree the House ought to consider legislation to ensure DREAMers can remain here &amp; pursue a pathway to citizenship. https://t.co/8U9YZKuPTR https://t.co/hrqcKMGUPG
Glad to join in thanking Christmas in April volunteers in Prince George’s County today.

This #DayofSilence, let us reflect on the bullying &amp; discrimination faced by #LGBTQ young people around the world &amp; recommit ourselves to confronting that hate.

These changes, which I called for in an @WashingtonPost op-ed after co-leading a bipartisan Congressional trip to #PuertoRico, #USVI, &amp; the FL Keys, will reduce risk to future disasters as well as save taxpayer dollars in avoided recovery costs. https://t.co/nMO1uBkaOB

What we must determine is how Russia attempted to subvert our democracy so we can ensure that precautions are taken this year and in the future to deter and prevent its next attempts.  To ignore this serious threat is to capitulate in the face of it. #ProtectOurDemocracy

In Feb 2016, I visited Flint with @RepDanKildee, @RepLawrence, @RepDebDingell, @RepCummings, &amp; @RepScottPeters to see the crisis firsthand. It is unacceptable that these communities still lack access to clean, safe drinking water 4 years after the crisis began. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/Vhd51xfykx
On the 4 year anniversary of the Flint water crisis, families there are still using filters &amp; bottled water. The crisis is not over &amp; Congress must do more to ensure access clean drinking water &amp; make robust investments in water infrastructure. #DontForgetFlint https://t.co/XQb0savZ4s
I also told reporters that polling from @MorningConsult/@Politico today shows opposition to the #GOPTaxScam is increasing. That’s because it gives 83% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest in America &amp; harms the fiscal stability of our country.

I urge @realDonaldTrump to nominate a full-time President of @EximBankUS who can be confirmed with bipartisan support, rather than designating an Acting President. I also call on him to ensure that the Bank’s Board has an operating majority so that it can function as intended.
.@EximBankUS fulfills a critical function in helping U.S. business &amp; workers compete on a level playing field when it comes to selling American products overseas. Now is not the time to abandon efforts to install a full-time, Senate-confirmed President. https://t.co/gM93crfIuD

I urge Republicans to take steps back toward bipartisanship and work with Democrats to negotiate a compromise #FarmBill that does not weaken our ability to fight hunger or support farmers. #ProtectSNAP 4/4
Dems are ready to work w GOP to write a #FarmBill that meets Congress’s commitment to growers &amp; to those who consume what they produce.  Our nutrition assistance programs help keep 40 million Americans from going hungry, &amp; they remain a critical tool in our war on poverty. 3/4
American farmers are already living under the uncertainty caused by low commodity prices and the potential impact of President Trump’s reckless trade policies.  They don’t need the added anxiety of House Republicans injecting partisan politics into the #FarmBill. 2/4
Disappointed @ConawayTX11 has chosen to mark up a partisan #FarmBill that includes severe cuts to nutrition assistance for Americans in need. Moreover, it fails to invest in rural development &amp; bioenergy programs, &amp; undermines conservation efforts. https://t.co/EUsFEZt7FJ 1/4
Thank you, @USRepKCastor, for leading this resolution calling for @EPAScottPruitt’s resignation. Pruitt has undermined public health, failed to uphold the mission of the @EPA, &amp; shown complete disregard for responsible fiscal stewardship. https://t.co/3tcpdVaOaw

When Americans pay their taxes as millions did on #TaxDay, they expect their tax dollars will be used to benefit the many, not just the few. The new #GOPTaxScam does the opposite by giving 83% of the benefits to the wealthiest Americans. https://t.co/g23SxRQFBp

An important reminder on #TaxDay—the #GOPTaxScam adds trillions to the deficit over the next decade &amp; puts critical domestic programs, such as nutrition assistance, on the chopping block. We must #ProtectSNAP. https://t.co/P5wooSByOt

Thank you, @RepAnthonyBrown, for highlighting the importance of taking meaningful steps to address poverty &amp; expand opportunity, instead of exploding the deficit to give tax breaks to the wealthy and slashing proven anti-poverty programs as the GOP has set out to do. https://t.co/0lJyx2ZDuh
The GOP is sticking future generations with a credit card bill in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest in America. According to the nonpartisan @USCBO, the #GOPTaxScam will explode America’s deficit by $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years. #TaxDay https://t.co/4spgy890Fn https://t.co/B9Xxxwnuhp
Due to the #GOPTaxScam, the wealthiest 5% in Maryland will receive the majority of the tax breaks in our state while thousands of hardworking middle class families will be left behind. That’s unacceptable. #TaxDay https://t.co/F1jphuIeAn
Republicans promised their tax law would benefit America’s workers, but nearly 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies have not announced a plan to share their tax windfall with employees. #GOPTaxScam #TaxDay https://t.co/4spgy890Fn https://t.co/gDqgucnulb
In addition, I told reporters that while I supported Friday’s strike in response to the use of chemical weapons, if @POTUS’ airstrikes in #Syria are an ongoing effort he ought to seek an AUMF from Congress.
I also said to press that if @RealDonaldTrump fires Rosenstein, it would undermine the rule of law. We must #ProtectOurDemocracy
There are a number of outstanding priorities that Congress must address: the need to fund govt, #ProtectDREAMers, protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, pass a bipartisan farm bill, &amp; more.
When speaking with press this morning, I said #TaxDay is a reminder that the #GOPTaxScam is another broken promise from GOP &amp; @POTUS. It benefits wealthy investors &amp; large corporations at the expense of working families &amp; explodes the deficit.
Today is #TaxDay, and under the #GOPTaxScam, the wealthiest in America will see thousands more in their pocket while the poorest Americans will only see around $40. https://t.co/4spgy890Fn https://t.co/LNLfCmeJhY

House Dems are focused on achieving that growth &amp; ensuring more of our people can #MakeItInAmerica. As we continue our #ListeningTour across the country, we are going to prepare an economic agenda that incorporates Americans’ feedback &amp; addresses their concerns. 2/2
While our economy adds jobs, we must remember what economic prosperity really means. Full employment must include wage growth so workers in our economy can pursue good careers that bring a secure place in a strong middle class. #JobsReport https://t.co/nEij4J6X0T 1/2
I was pleased to join you, @KevinConroyCEO, and I look forward to using your input and feedback as House Dems develop an economic agenda that helps workers and businesses like @ExactSciences #MakeItInAmerica. #ListeningTour https://t.co/hTBMiew1GG

Today we remember Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated 50 yrs ago on this day. He is with us in spirit, having left us a task unfinished but also giving us tools to complete it: compassion, truth, determination to strive for justice &amp; equality. https://t.co/VNaGf1geWZ #MLK50 https://t.co/rzxJS2vCT4

I agree with @RepAnthonyBrown that Congress should take up H.R. 2670, the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act. I’m proud to co-sponsor this bill, and I urge Republicans to bring it to the Floor to help #EndGunViolence &amp; keep more abuse &amp; stalking victims safe. https://t.co/8oDFl1rWw4
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a powerful advocate for #ME01’s working families and agricultural community on @AppropsDems, @chelliepingree.
Over a year into his Presidency &amp; President Trump has still not put forward meaningful legislation to support job creation &amp; signed the #GOPTaxScam which makes it easier to ship jobs overseas.

Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Assistant Whip, @RepTedLieu. Thank you for your leadership on @HFACDemocrats and work to #ProtectOurDemocracy.
Congress ought to take steps to overturn the Trump Admin’s effort to subvert the #2020Census by adding an untested citizenship question. Read more here about the importance of an accurate count of all residents: https://t.co/HgUBv5ouJ6 https://t.co/c1YnodmGwe

Appreciated opportunity to speak with students, parents, teachers &amp; school staff today in Charles County about the importance of ensuring our students feel safe in school.

Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and Ranking Member of @HouseSBCDems, @NydiaVelazquez. Thank you for your passionate, dedicated advocacy on behalf of #OurFellowAmericans rebuilding in #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI.
Everyone counts in the Census, and any effort that undermines that is not in America’s best interest. Congress ought to take steps to overturn the Trump Administration’s effort to subvert the Census. 2/2
Trump Admin’s decision to add an untested citizenship question to the #Census is an attack on immigrant communities &amp; on the integrity of the 2020 Census. This change will discourage participation &amp; undermine trust in and the accuracy of the Census. https://t.co/DYyjTSiEqh 1/2
26 retired generals &amp; admirals are calling for @RealDonaldTrump to reverse his harmful #TransBan &amp; #ProtectTransTroops. From their statement, “[the ban] deprives the military of trained and skilled service members, which harms readiness and morale.” https://t.co/XBGT2KcFs8
Wishing a happy birthday to Democratic Leader @NancyPelosi.
We must have a coordinated, strategic response to Russian aggression. I support imposing sanctions on those Russian individuals &amp; entities involved in the Salisbury attack &amp; hope Congress can work together to make clear that we will not tolerate such actions by Russia. 2/2
Glad the Admin has taken a step to punish Russia for its act of aggression against the U.K. However, one-off responses send mixed signals when coupled w @RealDonaldTrump praising Putin &amp; questioning if Russia was behind interference into our election. https://t.co/qmmYXIOxqL 1/2

Wishing everyone a wonderful #MarylandDay, the anniversary of the landing of the first settlers on Maryland soil at St. Clement’s Island. I am so proud to represent this historic area in Congress. https://t.co/tuRBOpAKbH
Inspired by #GMHS students who raised their voices at yesterday's #MarchForOurLives. It’s time for Congress to listen to these courageous students &amp; take action to #EndGunViolence in our nation. #NeverAgain #HornetStrong #WeAreGreatMills https://t.co/3aFI63sPcZ
Our military includes many transgender Americans who have volunteered to risk their lives &amp; we need their talents &amp; service. @POTUS’s decision to drive patriots out of the military weakens our security &amp; is inconsistent with our values. #ProtectTransTroops https://t.co/xyblm5n0cw
America’s workers deserve a raise – a permanent wage increase that allows employees and their families to get ahead. Read how the #GOPTaxScam stacks the deck against working families: https://t.co/u0UXjrWtWH https://t.co/72j7e44r6V
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, signed 8 years ago today, Americans with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied coverage or charged more for the same plan. Proud to support efforts to #ProtectOurCare from sabotage &amp; ensure Americans have access to affordable, quality care. https://t.co/iYPGv3jfgg
Today marks 8 yrs since the #AffordableCareAct was signed into law. Proud to play a role in passage of #ACA as Majority Leader &amp; see over 20M Americans #GetCovered under the law. Dems remain committed to ensuring more Americans can access affordable, quality care. #ACAat8 https://t.co/ASUn5NgGKM
Proud of #GMHS students Terrence Rhames, Vincent Giles, &amp; Marcus Smith for speaking out. It’s time for Congress to act on behalf of the thousands of students affected by gun violence in our country. #WeAreGreatMills #HornetStrong https://t.co/Ppp1moVcEy
Thank you @CongBoyle for introducing H.R. 5394, a bill to facilitate reporting on corrupt behavior of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. https://t.co/Cn9Qzhow24

My heart breaks for the family and friends of Jaelynn Willey. Jaelynn deserves to be remembered for the joy and grace in which she lived her life. My prayers are with the Great Mills community as they grieve their tragic loss.
A few reminders, Mr. President: 1. You ended #DACA &amp; created this crisis. 2. You’ve rejected every bipartisan solution put forward to #ProtectDREAMers. 3. @SpeakerRyan &amp; GOP leaders won’t allow a vote on DACA legislation. https://t.co/rwSjNSZQt6
Free, in-person support is available to all #GMHS families as they grieve following Tuesday’s tragic shooting. No one should feel alone - help is available 24/7 by calling 301-863-6661. #WeAreGreatMills #HornetStrong https://t.co/YANyvGknKG

I join @HouseAdm_Dems in applauding the inclusion of vital @EACgov funding in the #omnibus, which I have been calling for. These funds are important to securing our election infrastructure from Russian attempts to subvert our democracy. #WeMustNotStopHere https://t.co/8qhyOgvtbH
.@POTUS promised to make America’s economy great, but he has failed to take meaningful action to support job creation, raise wages, or reduce the deficit. Instead, his Admin’s actions are injecting great uncertainty &amp; undermining confidence in America.  https://t.co/k2AYkX1pkL
Thank you @RepStephMurphy for your leadership &amp; commitment to ensuring that the @CDCgov can research #GunViolence. It is an important step in our effort to #EndGunViolence. #NeverAgain https://t.co/N4DTPXJtBz
The consequence is a weaker America, &amp; I hope the Senate Intelligence Committee’s bipartisan efforts will provide real clarity into the extent of Russia’s attack on our democracy. 3/3
Committee Republicans did everything in their power to undermine a real inquiry. Instead, they acted as though they were POTUS’ defense team, distracting from attention on Russian interference by harping on conspiracy theories. 2/3
Shameful that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee chose to allow rank partisanship to cloud the investigation of Russia’s interference in our elections. https://t.co/NXupJPVjhk 1/3
8 years ago, the #ACA was signed into law. Since then, it has expanded coverage &amp; lowered costs. I joined Dems &amp; advocates to call on GOP to abandon their efforts to sabotage the law &amp; work with Dems to improve access to affordable, quality health care. https://t.co/mUHmaeBJ5S https://t.co/lndJt1kAFk
While I’m glad the funding bill passed by the House included provisions that will benefit #MD05, forcing such a significant bill through Congress without time to consider it is not fiscally responsible. Marylanders deserve better. https://t.co/2zis9psqJJ
The Republican leadership’s continuing inaction on DACA clearly reflects its unwillingness to resolve this crisis.  It is outrageous, and Democrats will continue to hold the Speaker to his word &amp; demand action to #protectDREAMers. 2/2
Republicans brought a 2,200-page #omnibus to the Floor in less than 24 hrs. It violates every rule they've set for themselves &amp; is not fiscally responsible. But what is more egregious is that the GOP continues to dissemble on promises to address #DACA. https://t.co/BDcx6WJJfK 1/2
Today, I asked @HouseGOP Members to join me on the Floor if they have read the 2,200+ page funding bill that they released last night &amp; we are about to vote on. Not one of them joined me. #ReadTheBill https://t.co/n2xTXZFWHn
Today on the Floor, the House of Representatives will consider legislation to fund the government through the remainder of the fiscal year. https://t.co/egWugfsvTU

I encourage anyone with information regarding yesterday’s shooting at Great Mills High School to call 1-800-CALL-FBI. https://t.co/uIClHZ1WBa
I also said GOP leaders need to speak out and not be silent in the face of efforts by President Trump to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation &amp; the credibility of law enforcement.
When speaking with reporters, I said I was appalled by @RealDonaldTrump’s attempt to seek favor with Putin by congratulating him on winning his sham election.
It is unacceptable that @SpeakerRyan is refusing to allow a vote to #ProtectDREAMers. GOP leaders ought to put DACA legislation on the Floor under the Queen of the Hill Rule &amp; let the House work its will.
I also told press that Republicans have had more than 6 months to get their job done and fund the government. We’ll see what they put forward, but they need to drop poison pill riders from the omnibus funding bill if they want Dem support.
I reiterated that the Congress must take action to #EndGunViolence. I agree with a MD student who said last week during the #NationalSchoolWalkout: “Their right to an assault rifle does not outweigh our right to life.” #NeverAgain
I spoke to press this afternoon &amp; reiterated my thanks to @FirstSheriff, @SMCPS_Supt, and @WaldenBH mental health professionals who worked so quickly to respond to the tragic shooting at Great Mills High School in #MD05. #WeAreGreatMills #HornetStrong

Restoring power to the thousands still without electricity must remain the top priority. Congress must ensure the necessary resources are available &amp; we should also take steps to help Puerto Ricans and Virgin Islanders rebuild in a way that is more resilient. 2/3
#6MonthsAfterMaria devastated #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI, #OurFellowAmericans, are still struggling to rebuild &amp; restore even basic services. Years from now, people will look back &amp; ask why the federal government didn’t do more to help – or help more quickly. https://t.co/GEU1dtLsF9 1/3

I agree with @BennieGThompson, @OfficialCBC Chair @RepRichmond, and @JacksonLeeTX18 that there ought to be a Congressional briefing so Members can learn more from law enforcement about the #AustinBombings. https://t.co/yqRxwqbQXz
Deeply concerned by news regarding #AustinBombings. I will continue to monitor reports &amp; my thoughts are with the victims’ families &amp; those injured. I thank the first responders, local law enforcement &amp; @FBI for their work to bring those responsible to justice.
Russians deserve a chance to reach for the better future they were promised when Communism fell.  I hope they will demand an end to Putin’s corrupt and undemocratic rule and the free and open elections they deserve. 2/2

It is dismaying @RealDonaldTrump seemed to dismiss the need to implement the sanctions against #Russia that we authorized, &amp; today’s announcement highlights how his own Admin is at odds with POTUS’ refusal to acknowledge Russia’s responsibility for the election hacking. 2/3
I welcome new sanctions against Russian individuals &amp; entities complicit in cyberattacks targeting our elections. However, they come weeks after Congress presented @POTUS with authority to identify those responsible for interference &amp; sanction them. https://t.co/XX0R91QUqJ 1/3

Today the House will consider 2 bills. @HouseGOP is ending the legislative week &amp; leaving town early without taking action to fund govt, bring meaningful legislation to #EndGunViolence, or provide a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/GksFdpdQFR

In recent years, Putin’s Russia has supported violent separatism in Ukraine &amp; Georgia, propped up the Assad regime in Syria, threatened Europe’s energy supplies, &amp; tried to hack elections in our country &amp; others. Russian aggression must be met with strength &amp; resolve. 2/2

Proud to stand w students on #NationalWalkoutDay &amp; vote for the #STOPSchoolViolenceAct today. However, the bill, on its own, is not the meaningful action we need to #EndGunViolence.

The House will consider 5 bills today, including a bill that provides resources for schools to protect students. While Dems will support this bill, it is not a substitute for real action to #EndGunViolence, such as strengthening background checks. https://t.co/1MSBwQd74O
Proud to stand with students from Maryland, DC, &amp; Virginia and call for action to #EndGunViolence. I continue to be inspired by these students who walked out of their classroom today &amp; into democracy. They're going to make a difference. #EnoughisEnoughDMV https://t.co/zeb921uMpg

Pleased to join @Americans4Arts &amp; @ArtsAdvocate_MD this morning to kick off their #ArtsAdvocacyDay. Art is a critical component of democracy and has the power to elevate our discourse &amp; remind us who we are. https://t.co/Ihc5lggra0
I told press the GOP is already abandoning their #GOPTaxScam as a message. It enriches the wealthiest Americans, leaves workers behind, &amp; last month @USTreasury posted the biggest budget deficit since the recession. Learn more here: https://t.co/u0UXjrWtWH
This week, @HouseGOP will bring the STOP School Safety bill to the Floor. I told press that I will vote for it, but it is not a substitute for commonsense, bipartisan measures that will #EndGunViolence like comprehensive background checks.
I told press this morning that lack of action on #DACA highlights the GOP's failure of leadership to solve problems important to the public. Nearly 90% of Americans believe we need to #ProtectDREAMers. GOP leaders should bring legislation to the Floor &amp; let the House vote.
When speaking with reporters today, I said @RealDonaldTrump’s ousting of #Tillerson highlights the dysfunction of the @WhiteHouse. This President creates chaos and it makes our country less safe.
I still believe that the Congress should establish a bipartisan, independent commission to answer the questions that the Republican Majority on the House Intelligence Committee are choosing to leave unanswered. 3/3
Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, has an important oversight responsibility, &amp; we need to make sure that the Administration is taking every step possible to protect the integrity of our election systems &amp; hold Russia accountable for its malfeasance. 2/3
Americans deserve to know what Russia did to interfere in the election &amp; how to prevent it from recurring. The House GOP’s decision to end an investigation into such a significant national security challenge w/o getting answers is a huge mistake. https://t.co/InLfu66cr2 1/3
The President refuses to acknowledge Russia’s attack on our democracy in the 2016 election &amp; hold Putin accountable. I joined 139 House Dems today to call on POTUS to enforce the sanctions against Russia that he signed into law last year. https://t.co/xXYadoK3Z4 https://t.co/yXVWz1WbnB
Happy birthday to my friend &amp; a champion for working families in #OH03, @RepBeatty. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to end human trafficking.

The #GOPTaxScam is having an impact on our national debt right now. Read in @Business about how the law that gives enormous tax breaks to the wealthy has led to the U.S. federal government posting the largest monthly budget deficit since the recession. https://t.co/VoJOAFnTRL
Putin’s attempt to scapegoat Jews for Russia’s campaign to disrupt our elections is reprehensible. I call on @POTUS to speak out against Putin’s statement &amp; make clear that the U.S. will not allow Russia to hide its role in undermining our election. https://t.co/d7kYoO0okx

On the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour, I heard from state &amp; local leaders who were deeply concerned @POTUS’s infrastructure proposal would require local govt to provide most of the $ at the same time that the #TrumpBudget cut transportation funds. #InfrastructureScam https://t.co/6A3jVhyuuy
Instead of transforming schools into fortified prisons and forcing teachers to carry dangerous firearms in the classroom, Congress and the President ought to work together to take meaningful action to address the root of gun violence. 3/3
Several of the proposals make it clear that @RealDonaldTrump is backing down and doing exactly what the NRA wants by giving the appearance of acting without taking any real action. 2/3
The “school safety” proposals unveiled by the @WhiteHouse reflect the mistaken view that #GunViolence is only a problem affecting schools &amp; arming teachers is an acceptable solution. https://t.co/LCwiwQajB3 1/3
.@POTUS &amp; our negotiators must approach this development with due caution and openness, and any talks should be based on realistic expectations of what can be negotiated and verified. 2/2
I welcome this initiative from South Korea for a mtg w @POTUS &amp; hope it leads to a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear crisis. However we have to be careful &amp; skeptical of overtures by North Korea, given its history of failing to deliver. https://t.co/pLqM6pWOVs 1/2
Democrats will continue to put American workers and their families first &amp; stand up for the principle that everyone who works hard ought to be able to #MakeItInAmerica. 3/3
The current @WhiteHouse’s embrace of supply side tax cuts, uncertainty, and new debt threatens to undo many of the shared gains we’ve made, and instead deliver the benefits of economic growth disproportionately to the wealthiest few. 2/3
Today’s #JobsReport announcement of 287,000 new private sector jobs created in February shows our shared sustained economic resilience over the last nine years, due in large part to the policies of President Obama. https://t.co/8RUoZF3chx 1/3

GOP leaders said there was plenty of time to address the #DACA crisis @POTUS created. Now March 5th has come &amp; gone &amp; @HouseGOP leaders still refuse to act. Today, I asked them once again to bring legislation to the Floor to #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/C7lXaXd6ST
Today, the House of Representatives will consider one bill, which does not address the #DACA crisis created by POTUS. Another legislative week is coming to an end without House Republicans bringing a bill to the Floor to #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/NUD86XNoeF
Joined @NewDay on @CNN this morning to discuss commonsense legislation Congress can pass to #EndGunViolence. An overwhelming majority of Americans support comprehensive background checks, yet Republicans refuse to put legislation on the Floor. https://t.co/BFfaqhUg0b

.@SpeakerRyan, the President’s March 5 #DACA deadline has now passed.  Every day Congress fails to act, #DREAMers lose #DACA protections. @HouseGOP cannot continue to ignore this issue. Bring bipartisan legislation to the Floor and let the House work its will. https://t.co/k2cdwPkqoh
I said to press that it is absurd that House Republicans won’t allow a vote on legislation supported by 97% of the American people to ensure universal background checks for gun purchases. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain
I told press I continue to be alarmed by the Trump Administration’s weak stance on the Russia investigation. Intelligence officials have said we are not doing enough to respond to the threat posed by Russia. We must be more aggressive.
When speaking with reporters today, I said we have 11 legislative days to pass an omnibus funding bill. That is possible if @HouseGOP works with Democrats on a bipartisan bill.
I told press that @SpeakerRyan said he would not duck the tough issues. He is doing exactly the opposite by failing to bring legislation to the Floor to #protectDREAMers, which 87% of Americans support.
Today, the House will consider 9 bills, none of which address the urgent need to #ProtectDREAMers. @HouseGOP leadership has failed to bring a single bill to the Floor to address the #DACA crisis @realDonaldTrump created. It’s time to act on this issue. https://t.co/PQe0tq4D0X

Dems will keep fighting to #ProtectDREAMers so they can stay here &amp; have a pathway to citizenship. #DREAMers are part of America’s present &amp; part of our future.  Congress must not fail them or else we will fail this country. I urge @SpeakerRyan to let the House work its will. 2/2

I told press today that @realDonaldTrump said he would sign a #DACA bill that Congress sends &amp; @SpeakerRyan says he will hold a vote on what POTUS will sign. Neither has happened. Both are being disingenuous. It’s time to put a bill on the Floor to #ProtectDREAMers.
At my weekly press conference, I discussed how the #GOPTaxScam overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy over the middle class. The skewing of resources to the wealthiest Americans is telling of the GOP’s priorities.
Today I told reporters about my 2nd #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. This trip, I traveled to the Industrial Heartland to Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indy to discuss entrepreneurship, education &amp; skills training, &amp; infrastructure. This is what Americans want us focused on.

Insurance companies could charge women higher rates than men for the same coverage, raise rates or deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, &amp; drop those who become sick. The presence of these plans in markets will cause premiums to go up for everyone else. 2/3

Thank you for hosting the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour yesterday, @RepMarcyKaptur. I enjoyed hearing directly from Northwest Ohio’s employers and workers about how we can make workforce training more accessible for today’s workers &amp; the next generation. https://t.co/YGUzfPRYV1
This afternoon, I toured the control tower, viewed the radar system, &amp; joined a roundtable at @INDairport w @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan to learn more about how #Indianapolis' investments in aviation infrastructure are helping the local economy &amp; creating jobs. #MakeItInAmerica https://t.co/FoZmk3Uakn
I heard time and time again today that investing in infrastructure is good for business. Local community leaders called on the federal government to remain involved in infrastructure as technology shifts. 7/7
I heard from community members doing a study on sustainability, resiliency, &amp; the city’s vulnerabilities when it comes to climate change, &amp; that Congress should look at what the country can do to prepare our infrastructure for the future rather than reacting to last disaster. 6/7
Another concern raised today in #Indy was about aging water and sewer infrastructure, a problem we see across the country. 5/7
Participants also discussed how infrastructure can help alleviate poverty so more people can #MakeItInAmerica. Improved public transit provides lower cost transit options &amp; jobs that can help Americans get out of poverty. 4/7
I heard public-private partnerships aren't a panacea. The debt from investments must be paid back, it’s not free money. 3/7
The @WhiteHouse infrastructure proposal asks for 80% of funding to come from local communities. I heard a unanimous "no" from the community when I asked if that was workable. 2/7
Today's #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour stop in #Indianapolis focused on infrastructure, which is key to creating jobs and strengthening our economic competitiveness. Here are some of my takeaways from the discussion with local leaders. 1/7
On Saturday, I toured @nrec_cmu w @USRepMikeDoyle &amp; learned about entrepreneurship &amp; robotics technology. We heard on the #ListeningTour that embracing innovation and rapidly changing technology will be key to ensuring businesses &amp; workers can #MakeItInAmerica. https://t.co/jVCERxVDzU
On the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour, I joined @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan for a ride on the @IndyGoBus, the largest fleet of electric buses in the country. Local officials discussed how investments in new transit systems has helped create local jobs. https://t.co/Yhk01ZSh2n
Good morning from Indianapolis, our final city on this #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. This morning I am joined by @RepAndreCarson &amp; @RepBarragan at the @IndyGoBus Center for a conversation with community leaders about infrastructure successes &amp; challenges in #Indy. https://t.co/2bcVM4jIuT
Happy birthday to my friend, Regional Whip, &amp; a committed advocate for consumer's rights on @JECDems, @RepMaloney.
Wishing a happy birthday to Ranking Member of @NRDems, @RepRaulGrijalva.
This #PresidentsDay, I join in reflecting on the service of our nation’s presidents, including John F. Kennedy whose remarks inspired me to pursue public service. https://t.co/vgzLacMFhD
With technology always changing, it’s important that workers have access to skills training throughout their careers. Roundtable participants said Congress can take steps to ensure that workers have access to continuing training so our workforce can stay competitive. 7/7
Another concern was that training for new skills is often expensive. What role can Congress play in ensuring that American workers have access to affordable skills training? One recommendation was investing in these programs instead of cutting them. 6/7
An interesting challenge brought up more than once at the education roundtable this morning is that children are presented with college as the only path post-high school. How can we change that? 5/7
In Toledo, I heard we ought to embrace technology and that we shouldn’t fear automation because American workers should build the robots that businesses will use. 4/7
Roundtable participants pointed out the best workers aren't always the best trainers. One suggestion I heard was to create partnerships between manufacturers and educators to ensure we have strong teachers who can prepare students. 3/7
Right now, there are jobs open across the United States but our workers are not trained to fill these roles. How can we close that gap? 2/7
We had a great discussion this morning during the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour in Toledo. We talked about the importance of ensuring that our workforce has the training necessary to be prepared for the jobs of the future. 1/7
On the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour this morning, I am in Toledo, OH at @trainwithcts with @RepMarcyKaptur &amp; @RepBarragan for a round table discussion on what we can do to close the skills gap &amp; ensure all workers have the skills training for the next generation of jobs. https://t.co/VRCHGr8uXu
No family should be torn apart like this, and our communities should not lose people like Jorge who are productive, law-abiding, tax-paying residents. Their story is why our nation must enact comprehensive immigration reform. I’m proud to stand with #TeamGarcia. 2/2
I had the honor of meeting the family of Jorge Garcia, who was brought here as a child &amp; lived in the U.S. for 30 yrs &amp; was deported by ICE in Jan. I spoke with his wife Cindy &amp; children Soleil &amp; Jorge &amp; it was heartbreaking to hear how this family has been split apart. 1/2 https://t.co/6PkvXcCf0V
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and Vice-Ranking Member of @NRDems, @RepHuffman.
Happy birthday to my good friend, @RepEliotEngel. Thank you for your leadership as Ranking Member of @HFACDemocrats.
An important theme raised in all of our discussions about how we can help more businesses #MakeItInAmerica is mentorship. Entrepreneurs need mentors who have faced similar challenges and can help guide them. 5/5
For small business to succeed, they ought be able to export their products, which is a challenge for many small businesses. I want to see how the U.S. government can help ensure that businesses that #MakeitinAmerica can sell their products around the world. 4/5
We also discussed the importance of educating high school students about opportunities to pursue entrepreneurship. How can we help change the curriculum so students are aware of these opportunities? 3/5
In #Pittsburgh, we discussed the importance of access to quality, affordable health care for employees. 2/5
The #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour is underway &amp; I’ve heard from small business owners about barriers to success for entrepreneurs. 1/5
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a strong voice for #WA01 on @WaysMeansCmte, @RepDelBene. Thank you for your work to highlight the impact of the #GOPTaxScam on middle-class families.
Following a tour of @EICPittsburgh, I joined a roundtable hosted by @USRepMikeDoyle to hear from entrepreneurs about the challenges facing new businesses &amp; suggestions for policies to help start-ups #MakeItInAmerica. #ListeningTour https://t.co/FlQEraZLD1
Kicked off the 2nd #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour with a tour of @EICPittsburgh with @USRepMikeDoyle &amp; local business owners &amp; discussed how incubators help businesses #MakeItInAmerica through workforce development &amp; training. https://t.co/O8Ipl3HtRo
I guess that counts as checkmate. https://t.co/FUq9g24ewV
The #GOPTaxScam benefits the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class. In fact, shareholders are seeing 43 times the profit compared to America’s workers. https://t.co/uZwrLDpOr4
The American people deserve to understand the scope of Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy. Allowing the Special Counsel to proceed unimpeded ought to be a bipartisan priority. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/Ry5zgBZXVH
No longer can POTUS pretend that Putin’s Russia was not responsible for cyberattacks targeting the 2016 election. Today’s indictments are another example of why the Mueller investigation must continue unimpeded. The American people need to learn the truth. https://t.co/mYwE4p4jR4
Read today’s @RollCall piece on my 2nd #MakeitinAmerica #ListeningTour, this time to the Industrial Heartland. I’ll be hearing from Americans in Pittsburgh, Toledo &amp; Indianapolis about economic challenges &amp; econ initiatives in their communities that work. https://t.co/ZgZJiLc7kh
I agree, @RepStephMurphy. The #DickeyAmendment impedes the @CDCGov from conducting life-saving research. I join you in urging GOP leaders to bring your bill to the Floor and take a step toward addressing this crisis. https://t.co/n9Dbyfoq39
President Trump, you ended DACA. You created this crisis. You continue to refuse bipartisan compromises. Now that your proposal failed in the Senate, it’s time to show leadership and work with both parties to #protectDREAMers. https://t.co/949S3sH12B
Following today’s votes in the Senate, it is clear @POTUS’ vision for immigration policy cannot move forward. I hope he will demonstrate real leadership &amp; work with Congress to find a bipartisan compromise to fix this problem he created &amp; #ProtectDREAMers. https://t.co/R6TKL79iAr
Pleased to join my friend @RepWilson &amp; the Congressional Members of #AlphaKappaAlpha at their reception in support of the Commemorative Stamp to honor Ethel Hedgeman Lyle. #SheDeservesAStamp https://t.co/JUgJe1713l
Follow along on the trip using the hashtags #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour. I look forward to hearing from our fellow citizens about economic pressures they face, initiatives that work, &amp; challenges that need to be addressed.
Many Americans believe that Congress is ignoring the economic insecurity they feel. The #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour tries to do things differently by getting out of Washington to listen to what they have to say in order to develop policies that address their concerns.
Following our successful #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour in November, I’m pleased to announce I’ll be traveling across the Industrial Heartland to Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indianapolis on the next round of the Listening Tour. https://t.co/UiGLz369MU
Wishing a happy birthday to @RepKathleenRice. Thank you for your commitment to national security &amp; leadership as Ranking Member on @HomelandDems’ Subcommittee on Counterterrorism &amp; Intelligence.
I am grateful to @BettyMcCollum04, @RepDonBeyer, @RepHuffman, @RepMcNerney, &amp; @RepJimmyGomez for speaking out today in opposition to President Trump’s #DirtyBudget. Dems are committed to protecting public health &amp; our environment from harmful budget cuts.
I reject the false choice presented in @realDonaldTrump’s #InfrastructureScam, which undermines public health &amp; environmental protections. America does not need to choose between building new infrastructure &amp; protecting the environment. We can, &amp; must, do both.
The #DirtyBudget released by the Trump Administration cuts 90% of the successful Chesapeake Bay Program at @EPA, harming Maryland’s public health, environment, &amp; economy and undermining efforts to #SaveTheBay. https://t.co/wbzULHcusF
The Administration’s #DirtyBudget eliminates thousands of @EPA positions on the front lines of the fight to safeguard our children &amp; grandchildren from harmful pollutants &amp; toxic substances.
It is unacceptable that President Trump’s #DirtyBudget cuts @EPA programs that help keep arsenic, lead, and mercury out of our drinking water &amp; air.  RT if you oppose @RealDonaldTrump’s #DirtyBudget https://t.co/4uHlTqICI7
Today, I join in urging Congressional Republicans to reject President Trump’s #DirtyBudget. This extreme budget undermines public health and our environment by slashing funding that helps keep our air and water clean &amp; preserve natural resources for future generations.
We have just four legislative days to #ProtectDREAMers.  It is time for @SpeakerRyan to let the people’s House work its will. He should put the immigration bills pending in this House on the Floor and let the majority rule. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/SXk0ckz61a
Read this important thread from my friend @SenDuckworth on why we must #StopHR620. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote no &amp; defeat this bill. #DisabilityRightsAreCivilRights #HandsOffMyADA https://t.co/1UtfO3Ryiu
H.R. 620 is a harmful bill that guts the Americans with Disabilities Act and must be defeated in the House. In the name of upholding the bedrock principles of civil rights law in this country and the integrity of the #ADA, we must #StopHR620. https://t.co/rAQx6Qj0Xg
Today, the House will consider a bill that guts the American with Disabilities Act. This bill this would be the first time Congress weakened an existing civil rights law, in this way, through subsequent legislation. I urge my colleagues to #StopHR620. https://t.co/57iMzrt7LM
I join in mourning the death of His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark.  As a proud Danish-American, I offer my condolences to Her Majesty, to Their Royal Highnesses The Crown Prince Frederik &amp; Crown Princess Mary, &amp; to all the Danish people. https://t.co/LkMHuSYRzM
@RepSarbanes @House_DRTF .@House_DRTF’s report on the #GOPTaxScam is alarming. Republicans added trillions to the debt to cut taxes for their wealthy donors. Thank you @RepSarbanes for your work to show the American people that the GOP is siding w the top 1% over the middle class. https://t.co/kHC2hLGvOQ
The Broward County law enforcement &amp; first responders securing the scene &amp; treating victims deserve great praise for their courage &amp; professionalism.  I will be praying for the victims &amp; their families to have the strength to face the difficult days &amp; weeks ahead. 4/4
There should never be a wrong place, especially when that place is a school.  And there is never a wrong time for us to do what is right and tackle this challenge head-on. 3/4
For how much longer must students, teachers, movie-goers, travelers, workers, public servants, concert-attendees, worshippers, and Americans of every kind have to live in fear of suddenly being in the wrong place at the wrong time? 2/4
I was again shocked &amp; saddened to see an American school subjected to the horrors of gun violence today.  How long before our nation comes together to address this crisis responsibly? #StonemanShooting https://t.co/Ymjp90cZ6L 1/4
Joined @AFGENational this afternoon to show my support for hardworking federal employees. While @POTUS and Congressional GOP attack our workforce, I’ll continue to stand up for the men and women who serve our nation. #OurVoice2018 https://t.co/S8jvmge4uj https://t.co/utxhYp3x2M
In light of testimony yesterday that Russia intends to target the 2018 midterm elections, it is imperative Congress take steps to protect our democracy.  The report released by the Election Security Task Force will help address this threat: https://t.co/cROoln31bh
I am heartbroken by the #StonemanShooting &amp; I continue to monitor reports. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the people of Broward County as well as law enforcement &amp; first responders on the scene. Our nation must take action to address gun violence.
On #ValentinesDay, it’s hard not to think of the most faithful relationship of all: GOP leaders &amp; their wealthy donors, especially after Republicans added $1.5 trillion to the deficit to give them enormous tax breaks. https://t.co/7jbbN6eXnf https://t.co/vKDyBLkKFu
For months, @OversightDems Ranking Member @RepCummings has been sounding the alarm about this problem, and I am glad that Committee Republicans are finally willing to investigate. https://t.co/fPBcmJkVZg
It is fitting that @GOPoversight should investigate whether @WhiteHouse personnel were improperly accessing classified materials while holding only interim security clearances. I hope this investigation is serious and bipartisan. https://t.co/tSBj5PL542
I join in celebrating the 200th birthday of #FrederickDouglass, a great Marylander who dedicated his life to advocating for the abolition of slavery. His portrait hangs in my office &amp; serves as a reminder of our continued commitment to equality &amp; justice for all Americans. https://t.co/QZyUp2UcHr
Please read this op-ed from my friend &amp; fellow sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, @HonTonyCoelho. He details why we must #StopHR620, which would gut protections in the #ADA. I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill. #HandsOffMyADA https://t.co/1svjqpT9UJ
I agree, @SenDuckworth. I urge the House to defeat H.R. 620, which undermines the Americans with Disabilities Act. #DisabilityRightsAreCivilRights &amp; I join you in the fight to #StopHR620. #HandsOffMyADA https://t.co/0imrSFOcKb
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and Ranking Member on @WaysMeansCmte, @RepRichardNeal. Thank you for your work to highlight the impact of the #GOPTaxScam on the deficit and middle-class families.
For years, @POTUS railed against the national debt &amp; promised the American people he would balance the budget. The #TrumpBudget is another broken promise to Americans. Take a look at how POTUS &amp; GOP have abandoned any pretense of fiscal responsibility →  https://t.co/HApxfNtJKA https://t.co/0UuAHzFoAG
.@RealDonaldTrump’s infrastructure plan is not a serious approach to building the 21st century infrastructure we need to have a strong economy. Read why the plan has already been dismissed out of hand by both parties: https://t.co/1Kqv41QDcl https://t.co/wxdY6dspCI
Glad to join @EleanorNorton &amp; @MayorBowser to break ground on the new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge in DC. I was proud to secure over $200M to make this new bridge possible. https://t.co/q1xnYaseWd https://t.co/WQs8jOPsEr
The #TrumpBudget bankrupts our country &amp; makes it harder for private sector companies to create jobs that allow Americans to get ahead. Take a look at how this budget blows a hole in our nation’s deficit &amp; shifts the burden onto the middle class: https://t.co/Q8NEbhXJhW https://t.co/GXhQ8J9ues
The Washington Passport Agency will host its next Passport Day on Saturday 2/24 at 9 a.m. Same day service will be available, and Spanish speaking staff will be on hand to assist customers. Click here for more information → https://t.co/j1q872fwZr https://t.co/v1neRCoGne
I also told press that Democrats continue to stand with the 86% of Americans who want to see a permanent, legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers. Hopefully the Congress will accomplish that in the coming days.
I announced today that I will continue my #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour this weekend. I will visit Pittsburgh, Toledo, &amp; Indianapolis to hear directly from middle-class Americans about the economic challenges they face &amp; how Congress can ensure they can make it in America.
The @WhiteHouse infrastructure “proposal” is a fantasy &amp; assumes state &amp; local governments will bear the burden of modernizing our nation’s infrastructure. I told reporters it is another pie-in-the-sky proposal from @RealDonaldTrump.
Today when speaking with press, I said @RealDonaldTrump’s #TrumpBudget is none of the things he claims. It is inefficient, ineffective, irresponsible, &amp; irrelevant. It represents another broken promise to balance the budget – instead it explodes the deficit.
I’m deeply troubled the House is taking up H.R. 620, which undermines the Americans with Disabilities Act. I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader not to bring this bill to the Floor &amp; will join with disability &amp; civil rights advocates in fiercely opposing it. https://t.co/kbxRiCpHZ5
Today on the Floor, the House will consider 9 bills. https://t.co/ik7kZ4PTVE
Happy birthday to my friend and Co-Chair of the Congressional Border Caucus, @RepFilemonVela. Thank you for your commitment to America’s border communities.
Happy #FoundersDay to the @NAACP. For 109 years, the NAACP has been at the front lines of the civil rights movement and has consistently worked to advance the principles of equality and justice. #FoundersWeek #MakeHistory #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/39eU8PBl4j
The #TrumpBudget doesn’t come close to balancing as a result of the #GOPTaxScam. With the tax law, Republicans blew a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy while sticking working families with the bill. RT if you think GOP is out of touch. https://t.co/Qzzkc8WviT
.@POTUS’ FY19 budget is unacceptable &amp; once again targets our hardworking federal civilian workforce. It also slashes funding for @NASAGoddard &amp; efforts to #SavetheBay, among other #MD05 priorities. This proposal is bad for MD &amp; our nation. https://t.co/Sx7CV9vSz2
.@RealDonaldTrump, @MickMulvaneyOMB—fixed your budget title for you.    Budgets reflect priorities, &amp; this is a clear statement that this POTUS doesn’t prioritize fiscal sustainability; middle class workers &amp; their families; or investments in our economy. https://t.co/8pjxbAnwgc https://t.co/DC05cmZyaR
New report that the Trump Admin is seeking to keep the @FBI HQ in downtown DC is extremely alarming. Congress must reject this reckless proposal and look into why the Administration would make such a careless decision. https://t.co/KNgyxXU0qG
.@WhiteHouse infrastructure plan is not a serious plan to fix crumbling roads, bridges, airports, seaports, rail networks or to build 21st century infrastructure we need to grow the economy. I hope Congress can seek a better alternative. https://t.co/FgGfsAcsOs
#TrumpBudget sets up our economy to fail by bankrupting the country &amp; making it harder for private sector to invest in creating better-paying jobs. Congress should reject this approach &amp; work to apply commonsense principles of fiscal responsibility. https://t.co/8pjxbAnwgc
Yesterday’s events at the Israeli-Syrian border highlight the dangers of continued instability in Syria. Americans stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel as that country legitimately defends itself against threats from Iran or anyone else. https://t.co/9BXtkVjtae
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a strong voice for college affordability &amp; Delaware’s working families on @EdWorkforceDems, @RepBRochester.
Pleased to welcome Dr. Lonnie Bunch to Prince George’s County this morning for the 37th annual Black History Month Breakfast, during which we honored African Americans who have served our nation in the Armed Forces. https://t.co/DqE8fDgsgh https://t.co/BccoWGBrr3
This action raises serious questions about what the President is trying to hide. After the President’s release of a one-sided, misleading memo written by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, it is only appropriate that Americans see all the facts. 2/2
It is deeply disturbing that @realDonaldTrump has blocked the release of the memo written by House Intelligence Committee Democrats, which clarifies the FBI's pursuit of a FISA warrant connected with the Russia investigation. 1/2 https://t.co/I0YNzKe2u0
Now that the threats of shutdown and default are gone, Congress must turn immediately to legislation allowing #DREAMers to remain here with a pathway to citizenship. Congress should have addressed this issue months ago. 2/2
This morning, America saw the utter dysfunction of the GOP, their inability to govern, &amp; failure to provide steady leadership. GOP controls all levers of our government &amp; are responsible for keeping it funded, yet they shut it down twice in one month. https://t.co/iDUfnN0pBx 1/2
A Republican Senator has held up passage of the bipartisan budget agreement all day. The Republican-led House is now waiting for votes between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. This is yet another example of Republicans’ inability to govern effectively.
With only hours to act &amp; avoid another #TrumpShutdown, I urge @SpeakerRyan &amp; @GOPLeader to bring to the Floor a one-day funding bill to keep the government open. Dems do not want to see govt shut down &amp; are prepared to vote for a one-day measure. https://t.co/zPiwCVqZfs
Today on the Floor, the House will consider the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017 and the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act, as well as two suspensions. The rest of the day remains fluid. https://t.co/nB91fb6lRH
Poland’s fight for democracy &amp; embrace of democratic norms have served as a model for countries around the globe. Given that history, I’m disappointed w the censorship law regarding Holocaust-era crimes. It is inconsistent with our nations’ shared values. https://t.co/V08N93M6c5
Joined @CNN’s @NewDay &amp; discussed the need to reach a bipartisan budget agreement as well as take action to #protectDREAMers. We want to make sure #DREAMers have the certainty that they're going to be able to remain here in the country that they grew up in &amp; pledge allegiance to. https://t.co/0xf66PoUZP
Today, I addressed the @AcademyHealth’s #NHPC18 on the importance of health policy and Democrats’ work to promote stability and certainty in health care access and affordability for all Americans. Read my full remarks here: https://t.co/D8GQdMlrMy
GOP has now voted 5 times to kick the can down the road &amp; force the federal govt to operate on weeks-long funding agreements. Republicans in Congress are derelict in their duties, and every Marylander ought to be outraged. https://t.co/y6GCHXKPqA
The fact that the President is, once again, advocating for a #TrumpShutdown is irresponsible and reckless. The American people expect us to do our jobs - not threaten a shutdown that would hurt them, their families, and our economy. RT if you agree. https://t.co/uaIrGLFj55 https://t.co/dJI6acCtSg
The Republican government has just two legislative days to fund the government, and instead of working to meet this basic responsibility of governing, President Trump is cheering on a shut down: https://t.co/7KS2Z1qrwq
This weekend, @SpeakerRyan deleted a tweet bragging that a high school secretary would earn an extra $1.50 a week while the #GOPTaxScam gives $1,191 a week to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. RT if you think @HouseGOP are out of touch. #ForABuckFiftyAWeek https://t.co/xThoz7lsy3 https://t.co/HUfE7LsGCD
Republicans again ask for more time with their 5th short-term Continuing Resolution, yet they keep showing us that they are unwilling to use that time to sit down with Democrats and do the work of governing. My full statement: https://t.co/8FaMJs2bJL
Why did @SpeakerRyan delete this tweet highlighting how a public high school secretary received a $1.50 tax break per week? Because under his #GOPTaxScam, the top 1% get a $1.50 tax cut every 12 minutes. https://t.co/eEJD7Yrx63 #ForABuckFiftyAWeek https://t.co/TYZeO1IsNK
.@SpeakerRyan bragged about what a public high school secretary can do #WithABuckFiftyAWeek. He forgot to mention that the top 1% receive $1,191 a week. Take a look here at how the #GOPTaxScam stacks the decks against the middle class: https://t.co/eEJD7Yrx63
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, @RepBonnie. Thank you for your work as Co-Chair of the @CBWGCaucus.
Happy birthday to my friend and @BlueCollarDems Co-Chair, @CongBoyle. Congratulations on your @Eagles win this weekend! #FlyEaglesFly
Today, when speaking with reporters, I held up a dollar and 50 cents &amp; discussed how out of touch it is for @SpeakerRyan to brag about that when the 1% will receive $1,191 a week. It’s another demonstration of the skewed priorities of the GOP.
Told press @HouseGOP is bringing another short-term funding bill to the Floor. We need a bipartisan budget agreement. We need to reauth health extenders in a bipartisan way, #protectDREAMers, &amp; pass disaster relief. Instead, the GOP keeps kicking the can down the road.
Today, I told reporters that the conduct of Chairman Nunes, in his writing and coordination of the deeply flawed #NunesMemo, smears law enforcement &amp; undermines the Russia investigation. @SenJohnMcCain put it best: “we are doing Putin’s job for him.”
Today, the House will consider a 5th stop-gap funding measure that kicks the can down the road instead of responsibly funding government &amp; addressing priorities, such as action to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; disaster relief. https://t.co/Fz7NAEz0qe
The House Intel Cmte voted unanimously to allow the release of the Dem memo providing greater clarity into FBI’s pursuit of a FISA warrant connected w the Russia investigation. After releasing #NunesMemo, @POTUS should have no problem releasing this memo. https://t.co/C53ibkq4RN
There is still more work that needs to be done. The Trump Admin has been undermining workers' rights since coming into office &amp; has done nothing to extend paid family &amp; medical leave or help families afford child care. I hope Dems &amp; the GOP will work together to change that. 2/2
I join in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Family &amp; Medical Leave Act.  For a quarter of a century, Americans have been protected from losing their jobs as a result of illness, pregnancy, adoption, or caring for a loved-one. #FMLA25 https://t.co/TE0FCjR1Dd 1/2
Today’s dramatic drop in the Dow index of 1,175 points, the worst single-day point drop in its history, reflects a growing concern that the economy cannot keep pace with the promises made by @POTUS and Republicans in Congress. https://t.co/iPo4i5Cdyq
Today on the Floor, the House will consider 9 bills. https://t.co/D8P9OsmcKM
Wishing a happy birthday to my colleague, @SanfordBishop. Thank you for your work as Ranking Member on @AppropsDems’ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies.
I continue to be deeply concerned by the fiscal impact of the #GOPTaxScam. The @WashingtonPost reports a dramatic increase in borrowing under President Trump, which is on track to be the highest amount in 6 years, due to the tax law. https://t.co/V2fb5DIK47
Today is #GroundhogDay, and #PunxsutawneyPhil saw his shadow. I’m assuming @RealDonaldTrump did too, which means at least 6 more weeks — if not his entire presidency — of chaos and inaction on the issues Americans care most about. https://t.co/La9bYRVKRN
Right now, Republicans are attempting to undermine the @FBI and @TheJusticeDept in order to protect the President. Retweet if you oppose Republican efforts to discredit our law enforcement and intelligence communities. https://t.co/qu8pHOoqgM

Nunes, “has undermined the trust of this House and of the American people in his leadership of the Intelligence Committee.” Read my full letter calling on the Speaker to #RemoveNunes as Chair of the House Intel Committee. https://t.co/Hha3s6XGeh https://t.co/VfzEVqWpUs
.@SenJohnMcCain said it best: the decision by @RealDonaldTrump &amp; @HouseGOP to release the misleading #NunesMemo does not serve Americans’ interests. RT if you agree that these egregious efforts to undermine the rule of law have no place in our democracy. https://t.co/T2E6Lm17vP
Joined in sending a letter to @POTUS warning him against using the #NunesMemo as a pretext to fire Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy AG Rosenstein. Doing so could result in a constitutional crisis of the kind not seen since the Saturday Night Massacre. https://t.co/dThwHkcmM0 https://t.co/Q7j4s11sGD
Chairman Nunes’s facilitation of this release and his altering of the memo was shameful and inappropriate.  That’s why I’ve urged the Speaker to #RemoveNunes. Congress must protect the Special Counsel’s investigation so that it can move forward unimpeded &amp; get to the truth. 2/2
POTUS chose to ignore the warnings from DOJ, FBI, &amp; intel community to release #NunesMemo to smear the law enforcement agencies investigating his campaign. Nobody has any doubts regarding what this is all about: undermining the Russia investigation.  https://t.co/raHAeSG7YE 1/2

Democrats remain focused on helping middle class get ahead.  While the GOP wastes their time pushing extreme partisan policies that put their wealthy donors first, Democrats will continue fighting for better wages, better benefits, and a better deal for working families. 2/2
Today’s #jobsreport shows that the work done during the Obama Admin to help the private sector grow jobs continues, if more slowly, under President Trump. But at a time when wages should be growing, this report shows weekly earnings fell in January. https://t.co/uSlmuR4tIs 1/2
I urge @SpeakerRyan to #RemoveNunes as Chair of the House Intel Cmte. Altering a classified memo after the Cmte’s vote is dishonest, violates House Rules, &amp; demonstrates the lengths he is willing to go undermine the rule of law in order to protect POTUS. https://t.co/tYbjX1LgeT

Tune in to @SquawkCNBC — I’m joining the show in a few minutes to discuss President Trump’s #SOTU address.
America perseveres not because of this President but in spite of the damage he is doing to our economy, national security, &amp; democratic norms. Dems will continue fighting for all Americans &amp; to make our union safer, stronger, &amp; prouder, not in rhetoric but in reality. #SOTU 2/2
.@POTUS spoke of building a “safe, strong, &amp; proud America” in his #SOTU but neither his words nor his actions over the past year are accomplishing any of those goals. He has made Americans less safe, less strong, &amp; less proud. 1/2 https://t.co/QiFAdIzgL6

I joined @TeamCavuto today to discuss @RealDonaldTrump’s #SOTU tonight. While the President may tout the #GOPTaxScam in his address, the law adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. https://t.co/d0TpaIEB46
The House just voted a 3rd time on a defense funding bill.  Instead, we should be working toward a budget agreement that responsibly funds defense &amp; non-defense priorities &amp; adheres to the principle of parity, as we’ve agreed to do for the past four years. https://t.co/85Ah6HZ86t

It is shameful &amp; wrong that Rep. Gosar believes that #DREAMers invited by Members to #SOTU should be detained at the doors to the Capitol – this temple to liberty and common dreams. This is not who we are. https://t.co/qT69HXQj7Z
If Republicans want to show the American people they aren’t engaging in a partisan witch hunt or blatantly seeking to protect the President by discrediting our national security agencies, they ought to allow Democrats’ memo to be released as well. 3/3
Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy ought not to be a political game but rather an urgent bipartisan priority. 2/3
Yesterday, @CIA Director Pompeo said Russia will likely try to interfere in the 2018 elections. Instead of taking this threat to our democracy seriously, GOP is demonizing the @FBI &amp; sharing classified info that will put our national security at risk, all to protect @POTUS. 1/3
I was deeply moved by the @WashingtonPost’s tribute to my former senior policy adviser, Ed Lorenzen. The American people were greatly benefited by his service, his knowledge, and his commitment to sound fiscal policy. He will be missed. https://t.co/geKIr3xMAW
Today on the Floor, the House will consider the @DeptofDefense appropriations bill for a 3rd time, wasting time when we have only three legislative days before the current funding bill expires. https://t.co/jvu7wdGlSP
I told reporters that Democrats have a simple request for @SpeakerRyan: agree to the same policy of parity you have agreed to the last four years—nothing more, nothing less. Our nation’s security is dependent on funding both defense &amp; non-defense priorities.
My guest at tonight’s #SOTU address is my constituent &amp; #DREAMer Gabriela Hernandez. She aspires to be a social worker, which will directly benefit our community. I told reporters I am hopeful we can move ahead with legislation to #ProtectDREAMers.
I told press today that I expect the President will discuss the #GOPTaxScam in the #SOTU, but it is a credit card bill for the next generation who will be forced to pay for the trillions in tax cuts for the wealthiest in America.
When speaking with press today, I said one year after @RealDonaldTrump took office, the nation is not safer, not stronger, and many of us are not proud of the policies pursued. #SOTU

As a co-author of the legislation authorizing sanctions against #Russia for its malfeasant actions, I’m disappointed the Admin chose not to make any public pronouncement on sanctions or put forward a concrete plan to deter further Russian aggression. https://t.co/n9g3ZYfZAl
Chairman Nunes himself said in 2016 that, “those who receive classified intelligence should not barter in it – that is reckless behavior with our nation's secrets.”  I would encourage him and his Republican colleagues on the Committee to heed that same advice today. 3/3
Such a reckless and spiteful action against our national security agencies and the FBI, in particular, would provide our enemies with insight into some of our most sensitive sources and methods for intelligence gathering, putting our national security at risk.  2/3
It’s outrageous that GOP on Intel Cmte would blatantly politicize the Russia investigation by releasing a partisan memo about the @FBI. It advances the latest conspiracy theory by GOP defenders of @POTUS, using classified material to defame the FBI. https://t.co/lnaqcKRmo0 1/3

The Republican majority controls the House, Senate &amp; @WhiteHouse. They failed to fund the government, causing the #TrumpShutdown.

Joined @JakeTapper on @TheLeadCNN to discuss Republicans’ inability to govern and address a number of priorities, including responsibly funding government, reauthorizing health programs, taking action to #protectDREAMers, and providing disaster relief. https://t.co/OqaZUZkZEh
Proud to co-sponsor the #CensureResolution introduced today by @RepRichmond &amp; @RepJerryNadler to censure @realDonaldTrump for the racist comments he made at a meeting on immigration. These comments are disgraceful &amp; damaging to our standing in the world. https://t.co/PA49aArb7y
Pleased to sit down with #DREAMers from @nakasec &amp; discuss the urgent need for a legislative solution to #protectDREAMers so they can remain in the U.S. &amp; continue to contribute to our nation's future. https://t.co/ClP1Sw2658
Tune in: I’m joining @jaketapper on @TheLeadCNN around 4:15 today to discuss the need to responsibly fund the government &amp; find a legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers
.@HouseGOP spent the last 3 months of 2017 ignoring priorities of the American people to jam #GOPTaxScam through Congress. While they make false claims about how Americans will benefit, here’s a look at 10 things they won’t tell the public about the law: https://t.co/M1GoUJGjij https://t.co/1sLm9lFvnl
Thank you @RepMarcyKaptur for highlighting the need to protect America’s @Teamsters’ pensions they’ve paid into for decades. Democrats will continue to advocate on behalf of workers and retirees and work to protect their pensions. https://t.co/WIpqyZnAMX
Thank you @RepMcGovern for highlighting @HouseGOP hypocrisy. Republicans claim they want to keep the government open, yet delay a vote on a short-term funding bill for a @realDonaldTrump rally. https://t.co/e660CmkOD5
I appreciate @JeffFlake standing up for a free &amp; independent press, the cornerstone of our democracy. RT if you agree. https://t.co/xjoVjzUgYe
Today, @HouseGOP is bringing their 4th short-term funding bill to the Floor instead of working w Dems to responsibly fund govt. We’ve given the GOP 4 opportunities to work w us to reach agreement yet they are kicking the can down the road once again. https://t.co/WkxjXfnq1n
Wishing a happy birthday to my good friend and fellow Marylander, @RepCummings. Thank you for your leadership in holding the Administration accountable as Ranking Member of @OversightDems.
Today, I had the privilege to speak at the #CongressionalGoldMedal Ceremony honoring my friend and a great American, @SenatorDole. I am so proud of the work that we've done together. https://t.co/mMT9gTt5ud
I want to thank @CASAforall &amp; @CASAExec for the important work they are doing in communities throughout Maryland to advocate for DREAMers. We’ll keep working together to #protectDREAMers. 2/2
Honored to meet w/ MD #DREAMers today &amp; hear their stories. DREAMers are students, medical professionals, teachers &amp; other members of the community who make real contributions to our nation. I won’t stop working until Congress acts to #protectDREAMers. https://t.co/zDc5aGAFu6 https://t.co/WJ4zD4F0fb
America is strengthened by our diverse immigrant populations. Democrats remain committed to a permanent legislative solution to #ProtectDREAMers &amp; ensure our nation continues to #ValueOurFamilies.
Two days before government funding expires, @HouseGOP will consider two bills on the Floor, neither of which responsibly fund the government, #ProtectDREAMers, aid #OurFellowAmericans, or address pensions. https://t.co/RXGkUMUUa8
Today, I testified before @RulesReps and discussed my support for bringing back Congressional earmarks with the reforms that Democrats made when we were in the majority to increase transparency and accountability. Watch my full testimony here: https://t.co/NXpgm9harP
Trump Admin’s immigration report paints a misleading picture of a nation under assault from foreigners seeking to bring terrorism, violence, &amp; economic drain to our country, &amp; has one goal: to distract from @POTUS’ failure to address the #DACA crisis. https://t.co/O6Pgd1Nudm
That’s why I launched the #MakeItInAmerica #ListeningTour last fall. As we continue the tour, I look forward to hearing directly from innovators and entrepreneurs on ways Congress can enact policies that launch our workers into careers that bring opportunity and security. 2/2
I enjoyed discussing House Dems’ #MakeItInAmerica economic agenda with @ExpandPGC in Largo this morning. While we’ve made significant progress since the recession, we must confront new economic challenges &amp; work to ensure no American is left behind. 1/2 https://t.co/dfkbSOHHqm https://t.co/aPD5to6tJE
Taking action to #protectDREAMers isn’t just the moral thing to do – it would also benefit the economy. RT if you agree Congress must pass a permanent legislative solution to allow #DREAMers to remain here and continue contributing to our nation. https://t.co/TxbwckazSy
I also told press today that Democrats will not be held hostage to bad policies &amp; inaction on legislation by Republicans. They have majorities in the House, Senate, White House &amp; are responsible for keeping the government open.
On Friday, I held a #GOPTaxScam town hall with @RepAnthonyBrown &amp; @ChrisVanHollen &amp; and the sentiment from Marylanders is that this bill will not be helpful to the middle class. I told reporters Republicans will rue the day they voted for this bill.
I also told reporters that we must take action this week to #ProtectDREAMers. Everyone agrees we should ensure DREAMers can stay here. We must reach agreement this week.
When speaking with reporters today, I said GOP is looking to kick the can down the road again with another short-term bill to fund govt. We must agree on a budget deal that adheres to parity as we always have.
It is deeply disappointing to see the uninsured rate jump by over 3 million people in 2017. @POTUS &amp; Congressional GOP took every step possible to sabotage the #ACA, driving consumers away &amp; leading insurers to reduce coverage options in the marketplaces. https://t.co/VKanwLs2wM
Today on the Floor, the House will consider 8 bills—none of which address the urgent priorities of the American people, including the need to fund govt, #ProtectDREAMers, &amp; reauthorize #CHIP. https://t.co/CjnGim2lvx

These comments clearly reflect the President’s true feelings on immigrants and make it extremely doubtful that he will work in an honest, decent way that reflects America’s best values on legislation to #ProtectDREAMers. 2/2
.@RealDonaldTrump’s comments are racist &amp; a disgrace. They do not reflect our nation’s values. Immigrants from throughout the world of all races, nationalities, &amp; religions have built this country &amp; are contributing today to its improvement. https://t.co/nyCqtlgMHK 1/2
I agree, @RepJoeKennedy. I urge @HouseGOP to take action to respond to this threat &amp; consider Rep. Kennedy’s bill to establish the National Russian Threat Response Center. https://t.co/hdMvsDTTmz
I look forward to reviewing the details of the reported deal to ensure it protects #DREAMers and does not harm unrelated immigration policy areas that should instead be part of a comprehensive immigration reform package.

While the injunction is important for recognizing the serious harm posed by ending #DACA, it is only a temporary reprieve. It doesn’t change that Congress must act without delay to provide assurance to #DREAMers &amp; their families that they can remain here. https://t.co/JeAkfqgK3q
Today on the Floor, House Republicans still aren’t addressing the priorities of the American people, including funding government, reauthorizing #CHIP, taking action to #ProtectDREAMers, or providing disaster relief. https://t.co/zEV23Vb94S
This week, @RealDonaldTrump ended legal protections for 200,000 Salvadorans living in the United States under temporary protected status. This misguided decision could spark a new economic and humanitarian crisis in Central America. Congress must take action to #SaveTPS. https://t.co/9pjcIfzge4

Happy birthday, @RepMikeCapuano. Thank you for your commitment to modernizing transit &amp; infrastructure in #MA07 &amp; across the country as Ranking Member of the @TransportDems Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, &amp; Hazardous Materials.
POTUS’ decision to end TPS for 200,000 Salvadorans who have sought refuge in this country is both misguided &amp; dangerous. Congress ought to pass legislation that allows those holding temporary protected status to remain here. #SaveTPS https://t.co/ZuqRbfUwsJ https://t.co/v1jPYN4M2j

In spite of the fact that the GOP controls the House, Senate, &amp; White House, 2017 has been defined by chaos &amp; dysfunction. As the first session of the 115th Congress comes to a close, here’s a look at how unproductive &amp; closed the GOP-led Congress has been:https://t.co/CeRZJv3k8a
I will continue to fight for a fully-inclusive military &amp; strongly oppose @RealDonaldTrump’s harmful ban on transgender Americans in the military, which is inconsistent with our values &amp; harms national security. #ProtectTransTroops 2/2

Marylanders deserve better than GOP’s inability to responsibly govern. Instead of ignoring the most pressing issues facing Maryland families, Republicans in Congress ought to work w Democrats to get things done for our constituents. https://t.co/AsisWvxmpc
Today: 13,006 #DREAMers have lost #DACA protections after @POTUS ended the program in September. We must #ProtectDREAMers by bringing the #DREAMAct to the Floor. https://t.co/sjElp8L9oe https://t.co/JnsSqKUVJM
.@HouseGOP brought a funding bill to the Floor that kicks the can down the road again and fails to address a number of critical priorities. They are also voting on disaster relief that leaves #PuertoRico &amp; #USVI behind. We can do better than this. https://t.co/j0CTBIl3JF
I agree with children’s health care advocates who are calling on GOP leadership to enact a long-term, bipartisan reauthorization of #CHIP.  Families across the country deserve certainty that their children will have health coverage. Instead, the GOP is putting coverage at risk. https://t.co/sr5ddTtmdv

As of today, 12,884 #DREAMers have lost #DACA protections after @POTUS ended the program in Sept. Every day @HouseGOP leadership doesn’t take action 122 #DREAMers lose protections.

I’m voting against the #GOPTaxScam, which would leave 86 million middle-class families paying higher taxes to fund tax cuts for the top 1%. https://t.co/kcI2NnnJwv
I spoke on the Floor today &amp; urged @HouseGOP to reject the #GOPTaxScam. They are pursuing a reckless and irresponsible path of raising taxes on 86 million middle-class families. Instead, they should work with Democrats on a bill that brings tax relief to the middle class. https://t.co/wj6DTMYpMV
As we near the end of the first session of the 115th Congress, it’s clear @HouseGOP continues to break their own promises of openness &amp; transparency with a record number of closed rules stifling debate and amendments.
I’ve heard @HouseGOP is seeking to shut down House Intel’s Russia investigation- I told press today Democrats will do everything we can to protect the rule of law &amp; get to the bottom of Russia’s attempts to subvert our democracy.
I told members of the press today that a number of priorities must be addressed before the end of the year. I am encouraging my Democratic colleagues to vote against a GOP bill that continues to kick the can down the road, instead of responsibly funding the entire government.
When speaking with reporters today, I said Republicans have rushed their #GOPTaxScam bill because they are terrified the bill will be disclosed for what it is—a tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
The latest analysis of the #GOPTaxScam confirms that GOP’s backroom deals made the bill even more generous to the wealthiest Americans while leaving the middle class behind. RT to urge Republicans to reject this scam on the middle class. https://t.co/fxbUEyZ49U https://t.co/rsZIL9BVZ8
By rejecting the nomination of Scott Garrett, @BankingGOP made it clear that Congress will not allow the @EximBankUS to be sabotaged from within. I urge @POTUS to nominate someone to lead the Bank who understands its importance to our economy.  https://t.co/am5l1expfb
As @HouseGOP prepares to vote on the #GOPTaxScam, it’s clear more Americans dislike the bill with each passing day. Take a look at the latest polling from @CNN: https://t.co/EwNlD20oJx
.@TaxPolicyCenter’s analysis confirms changes made to #GOPTaxScam to get wavering Republicans back on board have resulted in a bill that will raise taxes on 86 million middle-class households &amp; provide 83% of its tax cuts to the top 1%. https://t.co/cJagjHW5VJ
If this President is in any way serious about national security, he should start by embracing the basic tenets of American leadership: uniting rather than dividing, &amp; defending our democratic ideals abroad and at home. 3/3
POTUS talks about making America safer but undermines that effort – whether by refusing to acknowledge Russia’s interference in our election; threatening war w DPRK; cozying up to China; wavering on our commitment to @NATO; insulting key allies; or hollowing out @StateDept. 2/3
The National Security Strategy announced by @realDonaldTrump today highlights the disconnect between this Admin’s rhetoric &amp; the reality of his presidency. https://t.co/nEeOuVfStO 1/3
Deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life &amp; injuries as a result of today’s derailment of an Amtrak train in #Washington. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with the victims &amp; families, &amp; I commend the first responders working tirelessly to save lives. https://t.co/cB5yKNu2qm
Today, @HouseGOP will consider 8 bills — none of which will fully fund government, reauthorize #CHIP, #ProtectDREAMers, or address other end-of-the-year priorities. https://t.co/Lo6jYI1sZO
Reports that Trump Administration is considering a pay freeze on our hardworking federal workforce is unacceptable. Continued attacks on federal employees only make it more difficult to recruit and retain talented individuals to serve their country. https://t.co/vbqCSEHy3L

Happy birthday to Assistant Whip and Co-Chair of the Rebuilding America Task Force, @DonaldNorcross.
I joined the @HouseBlueDogs today to discuss how the @HouseGOP’s tax bill would worsen the national debt. While we’re for tax reform, we’re for fiscally responsible, revenue-neutral tax reform. https://t.co/UsSXzljkFt https://t.co/29wfDowqut

.@POTUS seems to forget that, w GOP majorities in House &amp; Senate, he &amp; his colleagues control all the levers of government. They have had more than 2 months to forge consensus on a path forward &amp; have instead wasted all that time on the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/LyYW0po0IN 1/2

When speaking with reporters I said that Republicans have majorities in the House &amp; Senate and control of the White House, and they are responsible for keeping the government funded.
There is no evidence that #GOPTaxScam will pay for itself. Republicans are already using the worsening deficits they’re creating to rationalize cuts to Medicare and Social Security.
I told press today that the #GOPTaxScam was passed in the worst fashion of any bill I’ve ever seen. If Democrats attempted to pass this bill through the Congress, @HouseGOP would be a 10.0 out of 9.0 on the Richter scale in outrage.

The #GOPTaxScam is not a tax cut and it’s not a jobs plan. The bill would add $1.7 trillion in added debt, meaning it would cost taxpayers $1.9 million for each job the GOP claims it would create. https://t.co/iuAuRJJlU6
On top of that, the Senate #GOPTaxScam would kick 13 million Americans off of their insurance coverage, putting further strain on our economy. https://t.co/53vEYvyGUi

While a new supplemental emergency funding request to help #OurFellowAmericans rebuild after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, &amp; Maria is welcome news, I’m disappointed it falls far short of what communities in TX, FL, #PuertoRico, &amp; the #USVI need to rebuild. https://t.co/sDxjXfGLpC
It’s the height of hypocrisy for Republicans to vote to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit and raise taxes on 36 million middle-class families. RT if you agree. https://t.co/9SBmkxWrhc

@HouseGOP I urge wiser voices to prevail in the Senate, where I hope this irresponsible &amp; partisan effort will be halted in its tracks. Perhaps then Republicans will come to the negotiating table &amp; work with Dems on real, permanent, &amp; bipartisan tax reform. 2/2
Today, 227 @HouseGOP Members voted to raise taxes on 36 million middle-class households &amp; to add at least $1.7 trillion to our national debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy. This is not tax reform; it’s a #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/k2eOXOVcFW 1/2
There is no courage in voting for #GOPTaxScam. Unfortunately, @HouseGOP just passed it, raising taxes on 36 million middle-class families. https://t.co/7HwadAetOA
