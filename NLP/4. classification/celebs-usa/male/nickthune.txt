Walking alone and just dared myself to lick a puddle and I did it guys. Still confused how it all happened.
Overheard two 5yr olds talking on the playground: “How do you want to die?” “Lava. You?” “In a video game.”

@CheetoSantino Oh
@CheetoSantino Does my quinoa salad mean I’m an A-Lister?
@ToddGlass Wink wink, see you there!
@BearrrChrissy @maxandharvey Ummm yeah it does. I hope the people I look up to never steal someone else’s words or thoughts to create a false image of who they are. It’s called plagiarism. All we have are words and if you are using someone else’s give them credit or you’re a fraud.
@ToddGlass @TVsJonDore That was totally sarcastic by the way :)
@ToddGlass @TVsJonDore LOL gotchu ;) in that case I hope I don’t make it on camera in one of the audience shots!!! Hahaha
Can’t wait to see what @ToddGlass has up his sleeve for his new special taping on New Years eve. 2 hours? ¡Ayayay! Ummm... I think I’ll be there 😋 https://t.co/6waeuO7Z46
@BearrrChrissy @maxandharvey They stole it without giving credit. A comedy legend wrote it and these dumb kids are trying to make it look like they thought of it. It’s called plagiarism and it’s a big deal.
@chrisleehutson Is bringing my own tambo to concerts and collaborating with headlining acts all around the country far enough?

@rejectedjokes What are your thoughts on someone sucking their fingers if they are eating buffalo wings?
@KristerJohnson @michaelianblack Had to sign a NDA :(
@michaelianblack @KristerJohnson Al negotiated my wireless deal for me
@michaelianblack That would be crazy because it would almost be the perfect cover that we are tweeting these totally hypothetical tweets about something that definitely isn't happening
@michaelianblack What if you just blew my mind and now I need you to run off with me and start a family together?
@michaelianblack seems different than sleeping right?
@brendonwalsh @jmerriman Your penis is 1/8th of ur body 🤔?

@tfh4 @TammyPescatelli @anylaurie16 @THR Why?

@ryanfalch @brendonwalsh GET TFO
Brendon is a scooper and that’s fine but if he just toasted his buns then he wouldn’t need to scoop. #toastthembunsB https://t.co/Iye3WhqMUl

@mikeykampmann It’s mine actually
@laurenlapkus I prefer Spaghetti Sandwiches personally
@musicpsych I always go garlic, toasted, full loaf
@badger_dave_ I’m a bread boi
@ThaBasementBoys U a scoop boi?
@Kinfinity_B I agree with this
When making a Spaghetti Sandwich scoop the bread or no?
@brendonwalsh @AlDelPriore I just put it up for debate
@AlDelPriore I’m kinda showing for the bread and the spaghetti is like a spice. I like it thick. I personally cut the meat balls in half to make it more manageable. @brendonwalsh
@AlDelPriore Never scoop any out
This is a beauty!!! #spaghettisandy https://t.co/YYBCq6uQfS

@ThatWeirdNinja @ElliottcMorgan You guys people can be different people!

@Brotherwags And we love each other for it
@Brotherwags Better than creepy tweets with joe
Got some new ear buds today! Mark and Tony. We love talking everything ears!
@brendonwalsh @ChaseHumps @DYKWJSI I actually think she sounds like a real cool down to earth girl my wife doesn’t like the PJ stuff either. In the end Brendon is a bad boy who can’t be contained and we need to love him for who he is and not who we want him to be.

@VDOOZER @CheetoSantino Can I have 40k? It would be a tax write off for you. You’d basically be saving money!!
@CheetoSantino @VDOOZER HEY ANDREW SO WHAT
@johnnypemberton In a way, yes
@BillyWayneDavis All is good Billy. Let’s go to a game!
So baseball is happening and I’m pretty happy about. Really looking forward to anti sports people chiming in!!!!
@CheetoSantino @VDOOZER Hey Andrew, Leave Bill alone he was asking advice. Bill, the Eiffel Tower has a good happy hour from 5-7. Sorry about how bitter Andrew is. I have physically dominated him before and know how he can be.

@michaelianblack @KristerJohnson wine country?
@michaelianblack @KristerJohnson MICHAEL DO NOT LET THIS ROAD TRIP INTERFERE WITH OUR TOUR DATES AND DO YOU GUYS NEED A THIRD?
@tristan_lex @brendonwalsh I have 3 different business I’m minding FYI
@brendonwalsh You need to start parenting. Tweet responses aren’t enough. I hope you guys have an open dialogue.
Here is an example of nailing something @ALKCM @MarvelousCrane @jackladdersings @hsidewinder https://t.co/wLYMavdIb8

@kylekinane Cant even imagine what would be happening if it was chardonnay?
@kylekinane You are on 🔥 tonight
@kylekinane @Braunger Possibly as an alibi for some sort of money laundering... who knows what Matt’s into these days.
@johnnypemberton I think it was Joe

@paulscheer @MsJuneDiane I hope these stories get told someday
@MsJuneDiane Gals are just like us!!!
@MsJuneDiane She also confessed to possibly opening her door into a Tesla which I think is a felony. @paulscheer are you aware of these instances? Authorities are willing to work with you.
@lukajones I haven’t
I witnessed a hit and run today and it was @MsJuneDiane at the wheel #LAPD
@theconradical @duncantrussell @brendonwalsh This seems like a good fit and I could be like a cousin who swings by every now and again!
@theconradical @brendonwalsh 😉🤟
@theconradical @brendonwalsh Sounds like a lot of interested suitors. Amanda if you wanna get together and go through all the options I’d be down.

Check out our newest “Do U No Who Jason Segel is” on the internet. @brendonwalsh &amp; I are getting closer to piecing together our super computer and we called people in Georgia. https://t.co/xI1ulCA2Ps
Transitioning from a “hang loose” to “oh, I’m getting a call on my hand phone” is a move I’ve got pretty dialed in

@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy I mean. What an absolute douche bag. How can you not see that?
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Thank you. Now let’s watch the video of Tom and his son casually kissing https://t.co/1lKzCXHfOt
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy That was the last game our teams played btw.... also, I admit, bad play call we lost. Now, give me your excuse? TB 500+ 3tds no INT no PUNT. How’d you lose?
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Do you remember the best NFL game of the 2016 season? https://t.co/LYpjLUqLQb
@kumailn Fav Tupac verse
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy I was just asking if you remembered? Jay do you remember?
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Remember when a second string quarterback just beat your team?
@robdelaney I’m so sorry for your loss thinking of you and your family.
@JayLarsoncomedy @thenicksh0w #thanksjay
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy  https://t.co/PlA0MidzP0
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy “Brady’s postgame behavior was consistent with a poor sport spoiled douche bag” is how I read that quote BTW #wheresjay #jaywhereareyou
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Please reach out!!!
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy And yeah, Titans online is a super legit source!! Thanks!
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Cool. Post a pic tho of Tom shaking his hand mid field. Looking fwd to it!
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy If there’s no pic I’m sure Tom asked him to come to a private room unlike every other quarterback who lost to Tom and shook his hand on the Feild directly after the game. HE SEEMS LIKE A COOL DUDE. #madeoutwithson
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Post a pic too. Cause I know someone would have been there to document it. Def wasn’t a patriots PR person that put that story out there. It for sure is real.
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Show me one other article that says that. Please. I’ll believe you. One legitimate source. And I’ll know I’m wrong.
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy No he didnt
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Shoot didn’t mean to write asshole. Meant to write douche bag. Also, RW lost to the number 1 quarterback. Brady lost to a second string nobody. Sit on that bitch
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy Still won’t load but here is a pic of a loser being a really good guy and not an asshole https://t.co/dBWm6pJBHN
@thenicksh0w @JayLarsoncomedy It won’t load for some reason
@JayLarsoncomedy Honestly didn’t mean to post this pic https://t.co/6kpyXftutH

@JoshuaKellert @natebargatze Nate has not taste. Been proven over and over again with shirts he’s worn on stage and music he listens too. Pretty funny guy tho!
@natebargatze @JoshuaKellert Nate you have zero taste
@JoshuaKellert Will not accept that Joshua. The outfit and song selection alone should be a jail-able offense don’t even get my started on the mic stand that was attached to a spring loaded thing on the stage. #lazy
@JoshuaKellert Joshua, That was some mediocre stuff. We can’t settle for that as a nation. I’ve seen some lip sync performances in jr high gymnasiums with more original thought.
@JoshuaKellert Wait, you thought was good?
Could he be that unaware and surrounded by people that were like “The outfit was on point son!” “Your song library has really held up!” “Those dance moves were savage!” “Bandanas are the new necklace!” https://t.co/yGmrYYMjRP

@MarvelousCrane @commonjackmusic @ALKCM @dominos I’d love to sit down over a cup of coffee and a slice of apple pie to discuss some day, brother
@MarvelousCrane @commonjackmusic @ALKCM @dominos What happened?
@almadrigal Yeah, seems like you have been pretty grumpy these last couple days. @moshekasher is this what we have to look fwd to in our 40s?
@BaldBryan @AdamCarollaShow @adamcarolla Or maybe they could explain at some point how they met on a walkabout or something?? Just give us something!
@moshekasher I mean, you didn’t even mention that the sheriff’s wife, in Missouri, is Australian
@moshekasher Yeah, it’s not like you mentioned the sheriff committing suicide because he had terminal cancer... thus putting sam Rockwell’s character in a tough spot because the sheriff was the only guy who believed in him. People need to chill!
@justin_keener_ Amazing B flip

@mrgoatboy @brendonwalsh It’s a dumb contract we got ordered to sign or else Brendon would have gotten a DUI
@StephenRKnoll @FunnyCHigh @TSA LOL BUT YEAH
@FunnyCHigh @TSA Thank you Chris. All I wanted to do was keep my hands moisturized. That’s it! No funny business!
Without meaning to I flew with a switchblade knife in my carry-on bag 4 times. Realized it and took it out for my flight today. However, today they decided to keep my hand lotion that is less than a ounce too big. Congrats to @TSA for protecting us very well!
@joeykling He a douche. It’s ok tho. RW isn’t very cool
@joeykling He’s a douche bag if that’s what you mean.
@RonMoevius You’re wrong
@joeykling You think he looks cool?

@brendonwalsh @JrocVernon @ToddGlass @netflix I have 12 more tickets
@NeverCanNezzer @ToddGlass Todd what day is the taping in ST Louis? @brendonwalsh this could be fun to travel to. Maybe open show with live podcast taping to warm them up?
@ToddGlass I’ve tried calling but it keeps going to VM and it says your VM is full. Do you have a home number?
@ToddGlass I bought 20. Trying to fill the room!
@annielederman @brendonwalsh Yeah, but what does that have to do with anything?

@ToddGlass @netflix @alexmurray @OutlawLabs @NetflixIsAJoke @brendonwalsh @Henlips @birbigs you guys wanna share a Uber to this on the 23rd? The Troubador is pretty close to a bar I really like. Grab a drink before?

@toddbarry @brendonwalsh It's a combo deal Todd
@Carterballs @toddbarry @brendonwalsh Thanks for asking. B? Any thoughts?
@toddbarry @brendonwalsh Todd, Thanks for clarifying. I hope you checked out the "washington" episode.
We also chat with a Fingernail Expert but I can’t remember his name. He had a log info and I’m sure we will be reaching out again. #DYKWJSI
On the newest “Do You Know Who Jason Segel Is” Brendon calls his friend Dave Matthews and we get to talk to the drummer guy too. #DYKWJSI #goldenglobes
@MikeSmithington I’m not sure, this is more of a question for the Errand Boy @brendonwalsh
@HiRyanHansen @robhuebel Oh, what seat? They had to move me to the second row. Seat 8. Can you see me?
@robhuebel Where are you guys sitting? I’m in row 5 seat 4
@brendonwalsh seems like a pretty standard issue baby to me

@blainecapatch @brendonwalsh @birbigs @JenKirkman @natebargatze @ToddGlass @Henlips @netflix I saw some clips of comedy Woodstock, all watermelon pieces splattered everywhere, shortage of garbage bag coats. It was a different time for sure
@Cory_Boylston @brendonwalsh I think that’s totally doable. B and I should clear that up on next recording
@ToddGlass @brendonwalsh @natebargatze @Henlips @jakefogelnest @JenKirkman actually not a bad idea to get some background people in the crowd for some planned cut-aways or even a fun heckle moment! https://t.co/cj3mDzTXmH
@natebargatze @brendonwalsh @JenKirkman @ToddGlass @Henlips Yeah, this is some Notting Hill/Love Actually/4Weds&amp;AFun shit!
@natebargatze @brendonwalsh @JenKirkman @ToddGlass @Henlips Damn that’s risky. Could work tho
@brendonwalsh @ToddGlass Agreed
@natebargatze @brendonwalsh @JenKirkman @ToddGlass @Henlips Seeing Ellen is the perfect cover cause totally worth the trip but then the engagement surprise at Todd’s Live taping would be savage 🤟
@brendonwalsh @natebargatze @JenKirkman @ToddGlass @Henlips @netflix I’m good next Monday and Tuesday. We can do it at my place, I have amps, quarter inch cables and XLRs. Brendon do you like SM58s or SM57s for your bongos? Def wanna get those amplified.
@brendonwalsh @natebargatze @JenKirkman @ToddGlass @Henlips True Brendon. If Todd thinks this will distract this is no good. Def his call
@natebargatze @JenKirkman @ToddGlass @brendonwalsh @Henlips Hell yeah! I know some CCR and also some James Taylor. If @netflix can’t get the rights I also have some original stuff. @Henlips wanna get together and get some tunes down?
@lisa_curry @ToddGlass @brendonwalsh @Henlips Thanks Lisa! Gonna repost
@Henlips @DirJordanBrady @ToddGlass @netflix Henry, Do you have a harmonica (key of G) bring it if you do. Also a tambourine. I really wanna blow out the intro song.
@JenKirkman @ToddGlass @brendonwalsh @Henlips Jen, CHECK AND CHECK. I’ll bring my tuner too (always comes in handy and if it makes it on the special it will be in tune)
@jakefogelnest @ToddGlass @brendonwalsh @Henlips Oh man, talk about a fun night with friends while watching your friends do what they love. 3k is totally worth that! So cool to see Todd @theTroubadour where he started!
@ToddGlass @brendonwalsh @Henlips Does anyone have a ticket link? Would totally love to support
@ToddGlass Hey @brendonwalsh mind if I tag along? Would love to see you perform infront of a packed crowd also to hang w @Henlips and See Todd’s big moment!

People keep asking if you see my butt in “Mr. Roosevelt” on @netflix. The answer is yes. I spoke with people at the network and suggested it be the cornerstone to their advertising plan. Never heard back. @RealTomHankz what gives?
Here is the new “Do You Know Who Jason Segel Is” Crazy to think @brendonwalsh &amp; I continue to pump out such amazing content! https://t.co/GgVEAFFLC3 #DYKWJSI https://t.co/4MLIqIdhnp

@brendonwalsh I’m going to announce something about changing my fans names from “Thune Heads” to something else
@barakhardley adrien brody in Peaky Blinders is the worst thing that happened to me in 2017

@GooseIsland @dogg724 @TheSecondCity It’s gonna be like a romantic comedy

It’s like they’re trying to say “Hey! Wake up! Your husband is still up watching TV and you should go down and tell him to turn the volume down even though he is already listening to it at a reasonable level!”
Why are commercials always trying to get me in trouble for having higher volumes than the show?
Have to say, this could be the best “Do You Know Who Jason Segel Is” yet. @brendonwalsh &amp; I call Alabama &amp; almost catch the ice cream man! #DYKWJSI https://t.co/awDfRrh443

Still pretty fired up about this! Nobody wanted to see a 21 minute Olaf-centric piece about holiday spirit! Absolute bullshit. https://t.co/7sN8MXrFKG
@chrisleehutson @caletyson It meant a lot Chris. I still have the socks you left at my house. Was going to use them as stockings for the season but if you need them back lemme know
@danel_lea @jonathanhaley82 It was absolute torture. Nobody wanted Olaf. Nobody. Shame on the people who thought that was ok.
@JohnSwettPrinci you seem like a cool guy so I will take what you said very seriously thanks for weighing in
@jacobmischka @justinfagnani He's now in therapy
@jacobmischka @justinfagnani No it wasn't fine Jacob. Try taking a toddler who wants to see Coco and then have them ask you 15 times if you're in the wrong theater because an annoying Frozen film is playing. Who do you work for Jacob? Disney?
@MrNishKumar I personally know 3 people who have been accused of dealing farts just for smelling them. The emotional/financial damage has been astronomical not to mention losing jobs/family. This needs to stop!
@MrNishKumar I'm only asking because this law is silencing innocent people who smell farts and are scared to tell people about it because they will be wrongly accused. This is an old law and it must go!!  Who's with me?
@MrNishKumar Are you a lawyer?
@jordantotty A lot of people got up and left after the short
@tommyjohnagin Hahaha yeah snowman guy
@duncantrussell Open your eyes!
BEWARE, If you're taking your kid to "Coco" there is a shitty 21 minute "Frozen" short beforehand. It's annoying and bad.
BORIS UPDATE @ THE VET

@PatMcAfeeShow @imbrandonturner I really thought I did great!
@brendonwalsh I'd like an address so I can start figuring out what route I would take. Also, might be easier if I get a part in the movie too. That way we would both be there and could do it in one of our trailers.
@brendonwalsh Do you know where it's shooting?
@brendonwalsh I think this would take you away from #dykwjsi which is your number 1 priority right now.
@Abb3ysDad Nope

@RealRonHoward Ron, I think this would be cool to use a dolly running side by side &amp; intercutting w drone shots to show how big orchard is compared to me

@chrisfairbanks @elizaskinner @BabsGray @chrislockefun here it goes... you can't protect her man. lying makes it worse
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks @BabsGray @chrislockefun Nothing feels better than justice! 2 bad him &amp; BABS couldn't get their story right ;)
@chrisfairbanks @elizaskinner @BabsGray Appreciate you confessing Chris! This should be enough for the authorities.
@BabsGray @chrisfairbanks @elizaskinner also,  it up to you to trust it. that's up to the Winnipeg FD and @oddblockfest
@BabsGray @chrisfairbanks @elizaskinner Then claim it was "Unbreak my Heart" and paint them to be too drunk to remember.... 2/2
@BabsGray @chrisfairbanks @elizaskinner Chris already basically confessed so... I know what ur plan was: Sing "Hero" for the drunkies 1/2
@totally_tod Nice! Wait till he gets to the early 2000s... might see his first ROFL

@rainnwilson @YouTube what's that song of his where he burns bridges with people?
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks @BabsGray Spoke to a few employees and shook down a Canadian comedian..(promised him a spot on meltdown lol)
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks @BabsGray I hope @oddblockfest considers all the facts before allowing them back on stage tonight.
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks @BabsGray him getting back in time to hit those high harmonies in the chorus almost makes it a perfect crime
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks @BabsGray If you think about it, it makes perfect sense. https://t.co/ywKYS3sJ2i
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks @BabsGray With a room full of drunk people, all Chris needed was one sober person "Chris never left the room"
@elizaskinner @chrisfairbanks my festival driver has some sort of 3rd man theory... I know him and @BabsGray were hanging...
@elizaskinner almost positive it was @chrisfairbanks
@elizaskinner pretty much the worst thing in the world

@ThijsMe no need just wrote it for me
@rileymac83 won't happen srry
just wrote a 4th verse that wouldn't make it on the recorded version but i would break it out at live shows
the bridge actually made me tear up when i thought of it
and the second verse has a ton of double meanings that point to afterlife and also climate change
the chorus is so good too
Just wrote a song that could easily be number 1 on the charts right now but I'm not going to release it

Don't like Nate as a person but love his comedy! Go check this out asap https://t.co/PARLjwEqcx
@bradmorris773 @VDOOZER (last year Brad was escorted out of "locks of love" corp office w/ a hand full of pubes yelling "theyre hair too!")
@bradmorris773 @VDOOZER This is the kind of stuff Brad started making up. His wife told a group of friends he started saving his boogers 2
@VDOOZER @bradmorris773 between u &amp; me I feel for the guy. Im all for chasing a dream but this is sick &amp; I know his family is beyond worried
@bradmorris773 @VDOOZER anyway, sorry to jump in here but "Dougie Gerber" was a fucking lie and a cover up
@bradmorris773 @VDOOZER I use to always tell u there is no water in pubes &amp; u would always reference Exodus 20 when they got H2o from a rock
@bradmorris773 @VDOOZER manager found u w pants down at the wheatgrass machine
@bradmorris773 @VDOOZER heard u got canned cause you were trying to juice ur pubes after hours

@brendonwalsh what? I love your vision and want to make these designs a real thing! Let's talk?!
@brendonwalsh this could be a money making thing for both of us... youre the artist but I need to make sure youre on the right track
@brendonwalsh I was looking for more of a partnership. If I'm going to put money into this, I want some say as to the cut and material
@brendonwalsh I like the design but I'm worried about the shape. Should we do more of a tapered thing?
@brendonwalsh totally!
@brendonwalsh I like using buttons rather than zipper too. I would love to make a sample
@brendonwalsh I like that a lot! What kind of material do you think?
@brendonwalsh I'd take a look and what you've got and maybe invest
@brendonwalsh What are your ideas?
@CaytonHolland @daveanthony we wait till the end of the season to make a run

@Kulap @whocharted @SeesoTV @howardkremer @BrettsBrain @earwolf #fondly
I was conceived on a water bed which probably explains my fear of drowning in my sleep while my parents are having sex
@Kulap @whocharted @SeesoTV @howardkremer @BrettsBrain @earwolf Very great times were had and I will always look back on it fodley.
I wonder if @bobsaget remembers this? https://t.co/SKtKFlydaL

@barakhardley You're one of the ones I would hope would do that
@GregSpitz6 I almost went with this but thought it was too on the nose "Famously Well Endowed Comedian..."
This was almost a headline today: "NICK THUNE KILLED BY GARBAGE TRUCK WHILE RIDING BIKE AND DRINKING ESPRESSO IN GLASSELL PARK"
@JasonIsbell @RollingStone this is amazing
@AndyRichter this is beautiful
@weismanjake how about giving credit to the people who inspired @Hamptonyount
@nickthune @seanoconnz what are your thoughts on this?
@KidsDrDave it's actually pronounced Snitcholas
@chrissyteigen I think there's a lot for her to work with here. Maybe for motivation watch it with her before the scene?
The biggest lie Sean Spicer has gotten away with is prouncing his name SHAWN when its supposed to be pronounced like SCENE.
@chrissyteigen "Nick Thune's comedy special "Good Guy" (start to well up) (blow nose) is the most moving thing I've seen this year."
This is amazing https://t.co/vqkHHs9dlD

@brendonwalsh @mikeykampmann Put it on me and move on??? Nice try. You owe Mikey a broom! #payup
@brendonwalsh @mikeykampmann I would but I need them because of the traffic coming thru my house. How many people, per day, come thru yours?
@brendonwalsh @mikeykampmann seriously you owe him a broom. #payup
@marcmaron @WTFpod Likewise. Thanks for having me over to sit in Obama's chair!

I've been banned from @TheRabbitHoleLA but I'm going to show up tonight &amp; do a surprise set &amp; possibly my own show on the sidewalk out front
@brendonwalsh let's do a duo thing?
@JayLarsoncomedy @TheRabbitHoleLA @roryscovel what time do you usually get there? I'm bringing my lawyer
Have security guards at the show. That's a start. If you don't I will find a way to get on that stage. https://t.co/ZxBOKiRhy6
Here's a short video from the premier of Dave Made a Maze @Slamdance // https://t.co/olhgrwtxF1 // @DaveMadeATweet
@bertkreischer @ComedyCentral @YouTube Thanks Bert but nothing compares to THE MACHINE
Not one of my prouder moments but will be indebted to @benkronberg for an eternity. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING https://t.co/EJgISwz7t5

@BlundstoneUS on my way there!!! hook me up!!
@fritzisdead instead you're about to get a block!
@fritzisdead Agree. Guess its hard to tweet anything these days. Was trying to do a double meaning tweet and people didn't get it. Deleted
@LongMasterWolf @Scotcharu yeah. Sorry. 2 many people coming at me that don't get that I'm on their side and the other side saying dumb shit
@hodgman https://t.co/DWZyCEFvKR
@JoeMande can you p-shop it so it looks like slam dunk comp and he's right below rim?
@jamesdshotwell Thanks James! Just saw it for the first time myself and think I talk too much!
@TheNickSolo @TheRabbitHoleLA really wanted to go but @JayLarsoncomedy and @roryscovel had people vote against it. I understand but am hurt.
@derekrocks @Prominence_LA @DrownedinSound @foxygentheband @ALKCM also... usually don't do this but I had some free time and it was fun
@derekrocks @Prominence_LA @DrownedinSound IN CONCLUSION @foxygentheband @ALKCM https://t.co/mzQfGqzMeY
@Alpha_Wollf i agree. i like bat flips in baseball and dancing on the field. but don't like people ripping flags from opposing teams fans
@natashaleggero worked well for @beck
@Alpha_Wollf yeah... but karma is more fun to say... and also maybe why line was bad?
Very proud to be @Slamdance this weekend for "Dave Made a Maze". Here's a teaser https://t.co/tJDu0kXaWz @DaveMadeATweet
@derekrocks @Prominence_LA @DrownedinSound "wtf you made?" seems like a deserved and honest question that people like u mock out of knowing
@derekrocks @Prominence_LA @DrownedinSound Both ways. If she can critique a band, I am just as qualified to critique her. Boring. Repetitive
@derekrocks @Prominence_LA @DrownedinSound I don't mind critics or failed musicians. Just people who come across as jerks and or bullies.
@Prominence_LA @DrownedinSound one honest question tho. WHAT HAVE YOU EVER CREATED THAT HAS PAID YOU MONEY BESIDES JUDGING OTHERS? 🖕
@JackZagg @Prominence_LA I mean, it's gotten you 478 followers! Congrats on how far you've come!!
@DeadBobUecker @DougBenson @realjeffreyross not as many people are as easy to burn as me... he had it easy!
@anthonyjeselnik @RiotLA is @brendonwalsh dropping in?
RIP vine. Here's the best one I made featuring my son https://t.co/wXxcohDcvk

@jordantotty interesting question. challenging to say the least
@michaelstjames that song is truly a reflection of the people who didn't get what was happening back then. love it tho
@TypicalMeldrick people didn't have pubes in the 70s, that started becoming popular around 1994
one odd thing i remember about the 70s was people didn't use toliets... that started happening around 1982 https://t.co/v5FDwxmPBn
@Otis_271 yes! so simple! also, never used toliets
Was born in December of 79. Will be doing a quick Q &amp; A about the 70s and what I went through in that crazy decade
