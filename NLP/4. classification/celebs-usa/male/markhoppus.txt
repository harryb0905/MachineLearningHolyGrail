@KimmyMonte ...Did Epcot write this?
@Laser_Cat @dave_cactus I will and I already have a title in mind: That’s a Wrap.
@sug_knight Yes ma’am. Saw it and thought it was just okay. I appreciated it going for something new and different but....
@Sam_is_Rocking I don’t know what this means.
@KimmyMonte The first HOUR is slow and deliberate. Maddeningly so. I had to watch it in several sittings, but then as the film developed it all made sense and I ended up loving it.
@sug_knight Fine. No coffee no workie.

@sydneyx for inspiration and ideas yes.
I’m normally a Leuchtturm1917 A5 lined guy, but somehow recently ended up with a dotted one. For lyrics I think I prefer lines. Moleskine is good also. Tried for a while to use the Evernote/Moleskine A5 collab but not to any success. wbu?

@jillboard thinking more about it, i think the blank gunshot was representative of sarah-sneaky, conniving, whereas abigail using poison is much more representative of her-direct.
Here’s my one question (SPOILERS) Remember the scene where Sarah shoots Abigail with the blank? I thought at some point we would come back to a similar situation but reversed, and it didn’t happen. Or did it and I missed it entirely?

@SortaBad @Shenanigans_luv Harsh but fair. Your point is well-made and I appreciate your attention to the matter.
@Shenanigans_luv @SortaBad “There’s GOT to be a better way...” https://t.co/Bw72RyjhsP
@Shenanigans_luv @SortaBad It’s referencing the one about the guy who is bad at finance because he buys so many candles, the expense of which takes the lion’s share of his discretionary income. You’d think the writer would understand the folly of his actions, but no. He doesn’t recognize the problem.
@SortaBad I understand this tweet.

@KimmyMonte Yes. ALL the small things. Come correct or don’t come at all.

@Tommytoughstuff I also deeply regret following Bucky.
In rethinking this tweet, I shouldn’t have used “all” twice in the first sentence. Better delivered as: “I insure my instruments because I like to cover all my basses.” Much more concise. We regret the error. https://t.co/T5buYRqy77

@dylanwilliam23 let me be clear. i am vehemently anti-elf-enslavement while also detesting dobby as a character. he should be free to live his life and also not in the films.
@ElleOhHell @BuckyIsotope Engage with my tweets at your peril!!
@dylanwilliam23 i'm talking about that annoying house elf who lost his damn mind when harry gave him a dirty sock.
@andylassner Oh sure like I'd take the advice of a "gopher" Emmy-winning executive producer of one of the longest running, most successful syndicated talk shows in television history. Pfft. Whatever.
@dylanwilliam23 unpopular take: i couldn't stand dobby and was so glad i didn't have to hear his annoying voice anymore.

@tastefactory I’ve long advocated that we need to add another day to the week. Monday Tuesday Wednesday (new day off) Thursday Friday (two more days off). We’d have to eliminate the months of February and half of March to make room for it, but it’s a sacrifice we should be willing to make.

@chrismcquarrie @SixxDemonBag @BBW_BFF @OhNoSheTwitnt I'm just going to say this: if Die Hard is a Christmas movie because it happens at Christmas, there needs to be constancy. Trading Places is then a Christmas movie. In MY definition of a Christmas movie, someone needs to learn the true meaning of the season: defeating terrorists.
