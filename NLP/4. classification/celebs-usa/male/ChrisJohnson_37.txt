In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.
When you fail you learn from the mistakes you made and it motivates you to work even harder. #Showtime

Action is the foundational key to all success.
@marshawnevans Morning Marshawn was trying to see how could I get the footage from me and you being on stage together last week
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.
A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him.
Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.
