Latest episode has elevated Manifest to The Greatest Show Ever
Curious now if the engagement this tweet has gotten means someone besides me is watching Manifest.
@KendraWrites Yeah I just read through this. I guess it's possible but still extremely unlikely.
I mean technically it could fit but armored cars do not drive around with that much cash
Laura and I are doing the math on the Manifest plotline that a guy who robbed an armored car stole... $75m. The largest note available is a $100 bill. It does... not work.

When the group arrived ... a kind of welcoming committee was gathered outside, including Chanel employees, the hotel‚Äôs staff and Lagerfeld‚Äôs butler, Fr√©d√©ric, who stood in a white coat and tie holding a tray with a chilled glass of Diet Coke.
Lagerfeld had been toting around a small Polaroid printer and gave an identical one to Hudson. Lagerfeld printed a photo of his pet siamese cat, Choupette. Hudson printed a selfie.  ‚ÄúI hate selfies,‚Äù Lagerfeld said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use your film for ugly purpose.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut where am I going to sleep?‚Äù Hudson asked.  ‚ÄúYou sleep on your seat, darling,‚Äù Lagerfeld replied in his heavy German accent. ‚ÄúI have to arrive fresh, you don‚Äôt have to. Don‚Äôt be selfish.‚Äù
‚ÄúI hate ugly people,‚Äù Lagerfeld told me. ‚ÄúVery depressing.‚Äù

Goodbye... to all my money https://t.co/fTPB3vtlOF
@DanteVertolli Let's just say you could never do anything ambitious within the platform. It's largely a feed for simple text, images, and video. So yes, in some cases it changes it massively (and also cuts short future experimentation / innovation in storytelling / revenue / etc).
@gokickassembly Google News, Flipboard, and many others provide the convenience you describe without destroying the publisher's relationship with an audience and then asking for a fee.
@Dockjaw Before the Verge was mainstream, it was extremely indie. Where will the next batch of sites like that find an audience? It will be up to Apple.
@DanteVertolli Publishers must republish their content along Apple's guidelines and specific app requirements, so yes, it is in a way.
But let's be clear - any one tech business that controls a massive path to LOCKED IN information should be shunned and checked at every level
This piece is so wildly flawed. Particularly because it assumes readers have made a choice about using Apple News when really it is designed as a dark pattern to stumble upon. It is UX as trap. https://t.co/FulcVnqAEA

@CaseyNewton My case with start with value of services. Google gets something from me but I get something from them. What is the value of what I get compared to Facebook? The difference is massive.

@pierce Could anyone be surprised that this product is half-assed?
@chrisdancy The only true expression of "not advertised to" would be to not care about a brand that has no brand (which is in itself a brand). It would be to literally buy whatever is... easiest? Cheapest? With no regard for label or methods.
@chrisdancy And yet...

@JohnWest But to do the work you need to engage with the data - hopefully, increasingly in a responsible way.
@JohnWest I don't think anyone thought of the iPhone when they conceived of how data would explain our digital footprints - the footprints got larger and deeper and we're still sorting out how all this stuff connects. I'm not letting anyone off the hook - they have to do the work.
@JohnWest This is interesting! I agree with many of the points you're making particularly about how bias is expressed inadvertently / by proxy in the use of data. But I also think we're at a midway point in understanding how to use the data and protect people - even Google.

@elonmusk @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg My point was not that the rich and powerful control public polls, it's that they move public opinion, as you are doing now. Hence much of the distrust in media. Ask Trump if it's been effective. I didn't hear you pounding this drum when they praised you, weirdly.

@jonathan582 @elonmusk @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg that's not what I meant ‚Äî I mean the powerful have a reason to keep the public distrustful of people who tell the truth, which good media does ALL THE FUCKING TIME ask Harvey Weinstein
@elonmusk @oneunderscore__ @ParkerMolloy @2sunsky @ashleyfeinberg You're very smart so I want you to think about this for a second. Do you think it's in the interest of powerful people to A: support a free press that exposes their lies, or B: tear it down so their lies are easier to tell? Now ask yourself why the polls would look bad.

@jaycaspiankang Man what is it about
@djeznyc @jaycaspiankang yes
@jaycaspiankang I think Rogan's audience is very specific and doesn't represent much of the overall media / idea audience. He has influence but I trust a lot of other people a lot more to tell me not just new ideas but good ones.
@jaycaspiankang Jake and Logan Paul are very popular as well, but I don't trust them to deliver me the best ideas. Joe Rogan is entertaining but some of the people he finds interesting are dumb as fuck.
@jaycaspiankang What is winning (a small part of the overall audience) is largely racism and identity politics couched as "free thought" and intellectual? well... read some of this shit ‚Äî it feels good to say it and a lot of people like to hear it, but it's not exactly smart or true

@RyanHoulihan Look to be honest the worst thing about this show isn't the politics. It's the acting and writing.
@RyanHoulihan I loved when Dan gets mad because he has an opinion on women's bodies and no one wants to hear it just like real life
@RyanHoulihan Ryan it's so bad
If you are a person that thinks the Roseanne reboot is remotely good I feel really bad for you. It is terrible on every possible level. It's like the sitcom in Natural Born Killers. A parody.

Well Mark, then quit your fucking job. Because someone has to be in charge of what goes and what doesn't, and your "community" is not equipped with the tools to do that. It's called "leading."

@johlag No they're definitely headed back to earth. Just like the show zoomed out at the end of the first season I predict it will zoom out at the end of this one - as they mount an assault on Earth.

Dude is a hardcore chapo fan https://t.co/cW4A4RaquR
We should stop using the word meddling. Meddling is when you stick your nose in someone else's business. This is a coordinated assault on our democratic process by a foreign government. That's called an attack.

I had to write about SOMETHING on this. Facebook VP says the company isn't using experts to deal with fake news because it's scared of being criticized. It's insane. https://t.co/reXvIOTv2h
Facebook is complicit in the rise of said misinformation if it won't accept the work of experts in the field to help guide its efforts. If its desire is to not just deliver but actually sort and clarify information, it is failing on the most basic level.
This is how hate groups like the alt right become empowered and enjoy a false equivalency that promotes retrograde racism, sexism, and violence through misinformation.
@aaronmedwards Yes!
A Facebook VP literally just said that the reason the company won't use media literacy experts to help sort what is bullshit from what is not is... fear of criticism. What a joke.  It's like saying someone might disagree with a lesson so just let the class teach itself.

We finally know how Twitter and Facebook feel about "fake news." I can't believe I'm saying this but... Twitter is actually doing something right. https://t.co/VLdicYRQ0p
How the rich really feel about the working class https://t.co/EBhNf689l7
A billionaire VC wrote an ode to the horrible working conditions in China and his desire to see Silicon Valley adopt similar practices. I have annotated the piece to clarify some of his points. Please enjoy. https://t.co/EBhNf689l7
see more of their BS here https://t.co/VtxwKLMDvc
DEAR MEDIA DO NOT FALL FOR THIS INSANE SHIT. Facebook has literally no idea what you do, and their "ranking" of your content will only create a new game for you to play. Why would anyone take their word on what is and isn't trustworthy? https://t.co/8xdhnDLcSU
@mcwm I am as confused as you are
Hi I have been..... nominated.... for this award???? They're telling me you should..... vote for me? I don't know but I think if I win they explain what a Shorty award is??? https://t.co/Ih19y7HUq8
I feel like this story needs to be seen. Publicists are literally giving journalists money to mention brands and products in posts at major outlets. https://t.co/ZaPSjjxNPc

@ammarmalik1 @ABC @thehill @CNN @nypost @TheWrap @NYDailyNews It's usually pretty obvious who has a story first. And many of these outlets only reported on what we had reported (at least in the first versions of their stories).
I will admit that I do not watch ANTM but after reading this... I think I should??? https://t.co/o1UqXCUlE3
@BrandyLJensen Please read the book the biggest secret it's on my desk
Heads up: here are shitty publications that won't link to you or credit you if you break a story (though they will rip off what you wrote): @ABC @thehill @CNN @nypost @TheWrap @NYDailyNews. All reported on our Newsweek story way after we broke with no credit.
This is fucking required listening https://t.co/cHzacqIXc0
@MichaelRahmani @adrjeffries @caseyjohnston @wirecutter She will still be writing for us!
I have two major announcements: the GENIUS @adrjeffries is stepping away from her role as our future editor to focus on writing. AND @caseyjohnston who is a massive GENIUS is joining as our new future editor... from @wirecutter (a New York Times company)
The DA and Newsweek weigh in https://t.co/xNdqNPbkGz
Hey @media_ink how about a link since we broke this story? https://t.co/xNdqNPbkGz
for reference https://t.co/cFeXGhuJIj
Where's Kurt Eichenwald and was he using Newsweek servers and was he trying to prove something to his wife

@lpolgreen @HuffPost We wrote about it a month ago, followed up with more yesterday, and it's news today. Just saying that timing is wild!
We asked @HuffPost about this practice and the next day they announced in the New York Times that they were killing their contributor network. But this is still rampant in the industry. A must-read. https://t.co/ZaPSjjxNPc

Pretty psyched that @BrandyLJensen is grabbing social starting today for @outline. Buckle up!
@John_DGP It wasn't about using or not using social, it was about using it as a tool, not being used by it ‚Äî every traffic source should matter to a publisher, but none of them should control what it does
Literally why I wrote this! What a joke https://t.co/QV2Htbk9uU https://t.co/TL1tUOHty2

@charlesoffwhite @Torsam74 I think Google is going to seriously reassert itself in many ways ‚Äî and I think their overall approach if they can back off of some of the heavy handed shit (like snippets) is right
@wgq I LOVE the hardware though and I do think the software has some really special qualities (it's still a hot mess but a better hot mess)
@charlesoffwhite @Torsam74 I think it's a great time to find your audience, wherever it might be. Certainly Facebook can be a part of that... but it won't be all of it and that's a super good thing.
