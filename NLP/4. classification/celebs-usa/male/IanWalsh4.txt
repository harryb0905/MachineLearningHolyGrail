@JameleenSkye always
Consider it complete 😊 “@StallingsSydney: I wish @IanWalsh4 would follow me. My life would be complete 💙”
Sounds like a visa nightmare “@lisaparkermills: @IanWalsh4 Wanna come over to Oz &amp; marry me?!?!?!?!?!?????!”
Thank you.. Means a lot :) “@DaveEmmons07: @IanWalsh4 thanks for being a huge inspiration to me. 🙏”
A bunch of emoji's just for you “@ElenaMont10: @IanWalsh4 what is that?”
That was a mental day “@Stifen634: @IanWalsh4 Check out this pic I took of you at Pipe in 2011. http://t.co/88WCgDaI”
So 4yrs 9 months ago you said no to the Trojan huh? “@isatrava @IanWalsh4 my son is 4 &amp; is an IAN Come inspire him! Teach u Spanish 4 free!”
March 16, 2013 more than psyched "@JameleenSkye @IanWalsh4 you excited for Menehune Mayhem? Any idea when it's gonna be this year?
Skullbase. “@ymke_f: @IanWalsh4 hi 👋”
What do I have to do to pick up that extra half?? “@RoneeCree: @IanWalsh4 is a smoke show and a half  #perfecttttt”
It's mutual “@ElenaMont10: @IanWalsh4 what is that?”
If it doesn't make me come home with 30 stitches “@ppankyy @IanWalsh4 Greetings Ian, anyhow coming to Mainland Mex this year?..big barrels!”
Just clogging your feed man “@kponch: @IanWalsh4 Just going for the tweet record tonight”
Setting what “@PaigeWoodring @IanWalsh4 On a scale of 1 to Buffalo Bill how creepy is it that Im setting this as the background on my phone?
Yes.. &amp; I took dolph lundgren's daily regimen #heshouldawon  “@YcazaLuli: @IanWalsh4 are you ever gonna tweet me and how are you so sexy?”
Not the slightest “@YcazaLuli: @IanWalsh4 am i non existent for you?”

Day made... Gracias “@PatricaCastelo: @IanWalsh4 you're so beautiful!”
@kenzienolebabe I wish. I'm in the water for the rest of the month. Maybe snow in feb :)
Favorite place on earth “@BessieyKay: @ianwalsh4 Just honeymooned in Maui! Do you like Mamas Fish House?”
Photoshop “@Hannahmahoney Ahhh your face... Your abs... Your Personality.. Did i mention you face? You're too sexy! Ok I'm done now #loveme?
Cowboy boots on a beach? “@MDismukes93: Wish the beautiful @IanWalsh4 would follow me back!!”
Done deal. That's binding “@AndreaSanndoval: If you follow me @IanWalsh4, I'll name my kid after you😏”
I do love BBQ “@young_breezy09: @IanWalsh4 come see me in texas! :) all I want for the new year!! ☺👍”
Jameson and ginger “@Hannahmahoney: #MentionAGoodCouple @IanWalsh4 and I... DUHHH!!!! #FBsForLife ;)”
Where are you taking me?? “@LoujaineR: @IanWalsh4 please make my day and follow me?”
Maybe next sept “@TeddyB314: @IanWalsh4 when are you heading back to the RIGHT coast ?! #ri Would be sick for some footage and FaceTime”
When I'm walking into a blind date sober as a falcon “@jamellejason: @IanWalsh4 so crazy! do you ever get scared ? your a mad man.”
Birdies &amp; barrels next session could be at jaws “@joeldude: @IanWalsh4 So..teach.. is @RickieFowlerPGA ready for a paddle in sesh at JAWS”
Most of my golf days are spent looking or my lost balls “@RickieFowlerPGA: Grabbing ammo @ianwalsh4 http://t.co/BZElFrSB”
Nope, still have a long way to earn my spot in “@O_Turns: @IanWalsh4 will you be surfing at the mavericks invitationals . .”
Noticed now “@robbardell: “@LoujaineR: @IanWalsh4 WHY DONT YOU NOTICE ME” because your a TRAMP”
Cover your knees if your gonna be out in public #itswayssunnyinphiladelphia “@craig3069 @IanWalsh4 why can't shorts be worn on the Tour???”
Dropping in 👊🏄🌊“@TheDonald23: @IanWalsh4 @rickiefowlerpga what's worse. Dropping in on someone. Or hitting into them?”
Golf for me by a mile! “@pilatesgirl23: @RickieFowlerPGA @rickiefowlerpga @IanWalsh4  what's harder golf or surfing?”
