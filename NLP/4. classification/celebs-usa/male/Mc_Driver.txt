#1 Pretty frustrated and disappointed with @AmericanAir. After being charged $425.00 for luggage and being told that ‚Äúwe are not @Fedex‚Äù I was delayed 6 hours last night to finally cancel my flight. Same flight and same plane rescheduled for 9am today has same maintenance issue.

Not the practice we had hoped for. @goodyear said something came through the left rear tire. You realize how fast you are going @NHMS once you hit the wall driver side. Everyone @Team_FRM is digging hard on the backup. Sorry @starkeycares we killed your great looking car.

Like I said best racing yet! No more downforce please.
New Leader! @FordPerformance
@mdownes311 @KySpeedway @NASCAR Best cars and drivers will always be upfront but Just wait the lead will change soon!
There has never been a better @KySpeedway @NASCAR race as tonight. Multiple lanes, lots of passing and we will see a lead change soon.
The racing is way better. Little more in this direction with a softer tire for a little bit of forgiveness and recovery and it would be üëçüëç!
What do you all think of the racing so far? Did the new rules help the racing? I am bias so I want the fans opinions?

Hey @NASCAR we got all day tomorrow to qualify. What do you say? We can all be here in the morning.
Safety First I agree! However we jumped the gun by 30mins. I don't want to see anyone hurt either but I did let me kids swim in the ocean.

Greatest day in racing happens tomorrow. 3 great races, 3 historical tracks and I can't wait. Cool to be apart of #CocaCola600
Happy hour went well for us. We have hit on a few things and we are making steady gains. P.24 @LeavineFamily95
Last few changes were good. Starting to make improvements on our #JPOAbsorbents @LeavineFamily95   @walr2772 was starting to lose his hair.

Cool to see @jamiemcmurray win. He seems to win the big races.
Ended up P.3 in qualifying. My @PizzaRanch @JoeGibbsRacing #20 was really good in race trim. Going to be a fun day @iowaspeedway tomorrow.
Listening to @MarsHill sermon series "Doctrine." God Judges is a great biblical understanding of our falling state. Enjoying this study.
I feel pretty good about our @PizzaRanch #20 today. Car has good speed and we made gains all day. Looking forward to Sunday @IowaSpeedway
