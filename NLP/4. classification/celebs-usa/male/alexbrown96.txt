@Kev0100 @LaurenceWHolmes @SBekovic @LanceBriggs @MattForte22 @paul_aspan The money for baseball is already there... on the table, already drafted... football it’s simply projections right now...
@SBekovic @LanceBriggs @LaurenceWHolmes @MattForte22 @paul_aspan @jsamardz @juliojones_11 @MLB Time will tell... but by no means have you won this one ... we will see where he gets drafted (2nd round IMO at best) and how he does.... he goes second round or later and I’m going to shed a tear for him... #MoneyGone https://t.co/xCVhCVu5UP
@SBekovic @LanceBriggs @LaurenceWHolmes @MattForte22 @paul_aspan We don’t have to go much further than @jsamardz and @juliojones_11 .... The talent isn’t close here but being the best in one sport and above average at best in the other.... The decision is simple 😱😱😱 @MLB ✌🏿
@LanceBriggs @SBekovic @LaurenceWHolmes @MattForte22 @paul_aspan Did you go where they said @LanceBriggs ??? I didn’t think so... he’s a little dude man ... all that running will stop by week 7... then what? 🤷🏿‍♂️✌🏿
@SBekovic @LanceBriggs @LaurenceWHolmes @MattForte22 @paul_aspan All I heard he did was make a monumental mistake by choosing the NFL over MLB 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
@SBekovic @LanceBriggs @LaurenceWHolmes @MattForte22 @paul_aspan He’s not gonna make it in the NFL.... declaring and actually being drafted high are two separate deals.  And a second contract 😂😂😂 don’t make me laugh 😂

@robert1_maus true but I LOVE football.. some play because they are good at it not because they love it.  And I never missed ...9 yrs str8
@robert1_maus @markgib007 @georgyjj09 @michaelutm77 @SCAR_179NY but I agree he should have found the 1 on 1 with our best off weapon
@markgib007 @robert1_maus @georgyjj09 @michaelutm77 @SCAR_179NY at this point balls already out of BH hands...
@robert1_maus it would be my pleasure to meet true Bear fans ... there is no one like you all!! #BearDown
@robert1_maus @markgib007 @georgyjj09 @michaelutm77 @SCAR_179NY it's the 2 minute drill not a Hail Mary lol 😂
@robert1_maus who cares if he didn't watch the game... I mean really... it doesn't matter.
@robert1_maus is there a 3rd choice??
@Politicsports Jay's more talented than BH hell hes more talented than most qbs,  but playing that position is more than just arm strength.
@Politicsports since Jay has been in Chicago he's a .500 QB.. Hoyer has been a backup but playing better than a backup right now... IMO
@Politicsports so you wouldn't start Romo when he's healthy?
@Politicsports what he did in the past is not what I'm talking about... I'm saying he's playing better right now than many starters.
@SCAR_179NY @Politicsports @AdamHoge @PFF I don't hate Cutler... I just love the Bears and want them to win like almost Bear fans. #BearDown
@Politicsports .... and from your logic you'd probably yank Dak and start Romo when he's healthy... smh.. that'd be a mistake.
@Politicsports so you're not gonna put that Hoyer has started/played in nearly 100 less games?? I'm not saying Hoyer is more talented..
@robert1_maus 2015- Red-zone touchdown efficiency: 48.0% (27th in NFL),  Points per game: 20.9 (23rd in NFL) ..that's with Forte and Marty
@Politicsports as coach Rivera would "figures lie and liars figure, you can always find a stat to support what you want"

@lowe074 @robert1_maus @SCAR_179NY The Bears are in these games because of his play not in-spite of his play
@lowe074 @robert1_maus @SCAR_179NY Jay had made that throw before, he's also missed that throw as well.  I agree Hoyer has to connect there
@georgyjj09 @robert1_maus @michaelutm77 @SCAR_179NY ... Jacksonville defense is ranked top 8 in the league ...
@georgyjj09 @robert1_maus @michaelutm77 @SCAR_179NY they absolutely could have been better in the red zone but they didn't suck...
@lowe074 @robert1_maus @SCAR_179NY yeah because Jay never misses throws right?  Come on now...
@robert1_maus @georgyjj09 @michaelutm77 @SCAR_179NY I agree...offense isn't at fault that our corner slips down, gives up a TD in the 4th
@DaBearfanaticDe @robert1_maus ... did you play??? I'm 4th all time on your fav team in sacks behind 3 HOFers..doesn't sound average lol 😂
@CoolAuntJules he may not be the long term answer but he's definitely not the problem.
@robert1_maus I remember Jay having Marty, Forte, Marshall and Alshon and he still never had a run like Hoyer is on.
@robert1_maus @michaelutm77 and that's all I'm getting at... Hoyer is not the problem.
@CoolAuntJules We will agree to disagree because backup QBs rarely enjoy the success he's having for this long. He's a keeper in my book
@robert1_maus we aren't even in those games if he plays... Hoyer is probably top 5 hottest QBs in the league right now... enjoy 😊

@crewluv66 @kfishbain Jerry Angelo drafted fantastic outside of the first round as well.. We need these guys (top 10 picks) to be Superstars
@crewluv66 @kfishbain I love what Pace is doing, I am talking about 2 picks that I have questions about...
@crewluv66 @kfishbain ... I sure hope he is right because his first two 1st rd picks (top 10 picks) are surrounded with ???????? IMO...
@crewluv66 @kfishbain I hope Floyd pans out because he's on our team, I'd  just like to see more than 4.5 sacks out of our future QB Killer!
Production! RT @kfishbain: Bullard started 6 games at NT, 5 at DT, 3 at DE for UF, notching 17.5 TFLs and 6.5 sacks. 6-3 with 33 5/8" arms.
Gr8 pick! RT @patrickfinley: J Bullard led @GatorsFB with 17 1/2 TFL last year, the most since  former Bear @alexbrown96 had 18 in 1999.
Perfect! RT @CSNBoden: Hope @alexbrown96 is happier w/ this #Bears pick. #BearsTalk BearBullard!

@BJosephs @kvolps great meeting you both. Hope you had a great and safe trip back home
@wesbrown47. What up bro
Come on 6!!! Bring it home...
A 140 characters isn't enough for me to express what I am feeling right now... Damn it!
What a game.... If there was ever a time I would love to be told "you got that one wrong" please let it be this game... Let's go defense!!!
Twitter fam, show my son some love and get his followers up .... @TonyB252525
Awesome!!! RT @ChiTribSports: Jon Kitna to donate his Cowboys game check to high school http://t.co/Y1PGzSALKc
Talking trash?? RT @TonyB252525: Merry Christmas daddy!!! And I did have a great day when I beat you yesterday in NBA2K14!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Merry Christmas to all... Hope everyone had a wonderful day...
@DarrenEdmark it's a different we ... As in my favorite team, I refuse to be a fair weather fan.. Bear Down! "WE"!!
A couple missed tackled and the RB hits his head on the goalpost.... We have Lacy coming to town next week.. Better get it fixed quickly!
Can this game end please!!!!!  I think we get the point...
Lol RT @Baldheadjames: @alexbrown96 they need a good DE from HCHS!
This game could get out of hand if the offense doesn't put together a scoring drive here... Let's go 6...
I appreciate that... Great talking to you as well... RT @RoyBethel: good talking to @alexbrown96 ! such a cool guy
Come on out and see ya boy... Over her in Schiller Park! http://t.co/uXzF8DNRWH
Prayers do get answered.... Bears holding on to playoff hopes... @AJJeffery1 is a damn beast!!
@Darch I am always a Bear .... I just have an opinion that is not very popular but that is ok with me...
@Ejayjones3 Done!  Let's pick this back up on Monday... Deal?
@jpf1562 Come listen to @670TheScore Friday @ 5pm... Hard to explain in 140 characters lol
@Ejayjones3 I love the Bears more than I dislike Cutler so I am still hoping that we win....
@Darch  Are you seriously insinuating that I am not a "real" Bears fan?
Everyone happy now??? Cutler is back... SMH!
What about now? RT @mullyhanley: Do you agree with @alexbrown96  that Josh McCown should start over #Cutler rest of year? (DR)
Lol 96 making plays like always.. RT @rcolvin3: Who is this guy out there wearing #59 for the @bears?You gotta make some plays buddy.#team59
Thanks Josh!!! Just won my fantasy playoff game with my dude balling out of control!!! http://t.co/II0phoSNRv
I am sure I have never seen Da Coach walk so fast trying to get out of that cold weather!! #ironmike
You know it!! RT @RickCamp670: You know @alexbrown96 loved that TD run by McCown. #Bears
I think I am going to get me an @AJJeffery1 jersey right NOW!!!! This kid does not disappoint...
@bobbymccray ya think we better keep an eye on @iWillSmith tonight??? Sparty them really kicked em in the teeth today... Haha
It looks like the National Championship game will be complete after all... An SEC team will be in...
So wait a minute... There can't be holding if the QB is running with the football??? C'MON man!!
I was hoping that the @Saints would get these boys back for the last time we went up there... So far... All HAWKS!!
Still a Monster! SMH #tipmyhat http://t.co/izZ8g4sUmE via @espnnfl
Does it get any better than that!????? Damn what an ending... If you didn't see the game you missed a classic!!!
Are you kidding me!!!???!!! Classic #bama/auburn
Happy Thanksgiving to you all.... Please be safe and eat as much as you can handle!! Let everyone in your life know that you are thankful!
Agreed! RT @jaejr: @alexbrown96 that sucked
The worst way for this game to end... WOW!!!
When was the last time, if ever, the NFL had two games end in a tie on the same day???
I don't know about y'all but K. Moreno has a TON of points for me on fantasy... Haha
@ChuckGarfien I can't wait to see this...
@shaners33 thanks... I appreciate that..
Say it ain't so...  :( RT @RickCamp670: "@SInow: Report: Will Muschamp will coach Florida in 2014 http://t.co/r3TuBAP14B" @alexbrown96
Honestly, did we expect anything less than a classic between these two???  #Peyton&amp;Brady at it again...
I'm a Bears fan and all but seriously. A personal foul for putting your helmet in the chest of a QB?? What has the league become? #awfulcall

Winning is winning and that's all I want the Bears to do... Whether that is with Jay or McCown and right now McCown is the go to guy...IMO!

Watching my Gators get whipped by Vandy... @hthill must be pretty happy right now.  I just broke my TV!! #changecoming
@sixtwentysix well thank you! Lol
@sixtwentysix what you aren't understanding is that not much about football, if you really think about it, is logical! Have a great night!
@cbendik79 @sixtwentysix @dan_bernstein @nfl ... We aren't going to agree on this one.
@sixtwentysix @dan_bernstein @nfl did you play? If not, then this is done because you wouldn't understand!
@cbendik79 @sixtwentysix @dan_bernstein @nfl you think it doesn't happen because it's "strictly prohibited"? Come on now... Let's be honest
@sixtwentysix @dan_bernstein @NFL  trust me.... It's nothing like working at Best Buy or McDonalds or a big law firm.. It is different..
To all my die hard Bear fans out there... Please DON"T take it easy on my dude @dherbs99 after our Bears whip @DetroitLionsNFL #BearDown
@wcrtchicago he will be a good addition #fingerscrossed
Agreed! Ha RT @ADewarOfScience: Boooo there's only one 96 @alexbrown96 @ZachZaidman: #Bears have assigned DT Jay Ratliff uniform number 96.”
