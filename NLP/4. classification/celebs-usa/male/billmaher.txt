A National Emergency should not be used by Trump. It should be used on Trump. https://t.co/EfPUfI7Ys5
Here's a way I always thought you cld tell if something was NOT an emergency: when the solution involves cement. You never see in an action movie the president pick up the red phone and say "Get me a landscape architect - NOW!"
Since Trump's people now chant "Finish the Wall" and believe much of it has been built, could he convince them Hillary has been locked up? I can already hear them chanting: "Keep her locked up!"
So it‚Äôs a real billionaire with a real newspaper against a fake billionaire with a fake newspaper. #TrumpVsBezos https://t.co/FOjORuJaVt

Trump must be glad he doesn't have to intimidate the ever-loyal Roger Stone like he did Cohen. Mob tactics, the one thing Trump is good at. Today Paul Manafort woke up with an ostrich's head in his bed.
Aside from the little matter of basing his argument on bullshit, why does Trump keep going back in the ring with Pelosi to get his ass kicked? State of Union speech? The last time he got shot down by a woman that bad was after he took Nancy O'Dell furniture shopping.
Just know as this shutdown drags on that thousands of secret service agents are working without pay: yes, the men and women who keep Steven Miller from getting punched in the face are doing it out of a sense of honor.
Ah, MLK Day, when Republicans say such glowing things about Dr. King. Really, really glowing, and it makes me wonder what they'd say if he was alive.

We found out the FBI was investigating the President of the United States for being a Russian agent. If you remember one thing about the last two months, that's it. And spoiler alert: He is! #TrumpTowerMoscow #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/xGXs8JlEBs
This is too much, on the night we start our new season of Real Time, Trump gives me the gift of a smoking gun, impeachable crime. Really, you shouldn't have. I mean, you shouldn't have done all the crimes you did, but at least your timing is good.
Republicans say "Trump shldn't declare a nat'l emergency with the wall, cuz next a Democrat president cld declare one for climate change." Yeah, let's make sure there's no mission-creep with nat'l emergencies and we start declaring real ones.

Been saying "slow moving coup" "treason" "traitor" since before Election '16, and always guests said I was alarmist, overstating, etc. Well, after we learned this week FBI was looking into #TrumpAsTraitor, I hear it all over. Good time to get back to work. Can't wait till Friday!
Again, not to harp on the "don't say stupid" thing, but if certain people could stop obsessing on the nonsensical idea that a "wall" can stop all border problems, then a certain president wouldn't insist on it. Certainly.
Hearing tales of furloughed govt workers who can't make basic payments after missing one or two paychecks is a reminder of our fucked up economy! These are supposed to be middle class jobs, but if you can't survive skipping one paycheck, that's not middle class!
Hearing Trump‚Äôs ridic ‚Äústatistics‚Äù about terrorists coming thru WHERE THE WALL SHLD BE! and then picturing his fans nodding along...u see why it‚Äôs so hard to comply with the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call them stupid!‚Äù request? Can I say ‚ÄúBrightness Challenged‚Äù?
This #NickFoles is the Jay Leno of football - he keeps winning,and they keep replacing him. Watch, they‚Äôll do it again next year. Also, who gives a shit I‚Äôm a Giants fan.
If a Dem prez did a tenth of Trump's crimes/crazy pronouncements, etc wld Repub.s hesitate for a minute to impeach him? Wld they worry "how it wld look" and say "what about the backlash?" Fuck no. 'Do what you believe' beats 'Finger in the wind' with voters almost always.
Harassment in the Bernie campaign not cool, but I like his response to Did you know?:‚ÄùI was a little busy running around the country trying to make the case‚Äù I‚Äôm sure Dems will do what they do best and destroy another of their leaders.

Trump:"Its a disgrace what's happening our country, but other than that i wish everybody a very merry Xmas" - only he cld take a holiday that uses pagan tree worship and flying deer to celebrate a virgin birth and make it into something ridiculous.
I know xmas Eve isn‚Äôt the time we typically think of the Kurds, but we just did it to them again! Left them to get attacked after Gulf War, and now with Trump‚Äôs Syria pullout. It‚Äôs almost like Republican presidents can‚Äôt be trusted...
Looking forward to Republican's shift from "Yay, the Trump economy! Fuck yeah!" (even though it was always just a continuation and slight building on the Obama economy) to "I think we can all agree recessions are cyclical."

I kind of like the idea of Melania firing everybody in the White House. And they should have seen it coming, the writing was on the coat.
Before election, I told Trump voters, as soon as its over, the caravan will disappear from the news...see? And to the media (especially cable news) who say the caravan "has disappeared from the news" - you put it there! You are always doing Trump's bidding for him. #Enablers
When something bad happens, its not complete until Trump tweets something heartless and ignorant about it - it ain't over till the fat baby zings - so of course he's blaming our fires on tree huggers. Does he know Thousand Oaks is a town and not actually a thousand oaks?

Could ONE reporter ONE time say to Trump when he complains the press is negative and hostile (as he's doing right now), "Sir, its because you LIE and we have to report that. Don't lie and we won't be so "negative". ONCE please?
Remember after the '08 crash, banks had to do a "stress test" to see if they could withstand big losses? Trump is kind of our "stress test" for democracy - to see if our institutions, laws, norms and basic decency can hold. Don't fuck it up, folks - please vote!
...all kidding aside, there isn't an illegal crime wave. There just isn't. Some Americans commit crimes, some don't. The ones who do tend to be in the cabinet.
From early optics, it looks like our Soros-funded plan to bring caravan migrants to Hillary's pizza parlor to get registered to commit massive voter fraud in return for free luxury cars is working - oh...woops.
Message to Trump voters: Vote Democrat, because as soon as this election is over, no one will give a shit about the caravan. But you'll still have diabetes.

Well, at least it didn't end in two minutes, which it could have (insert own Stormy joke here). Prediction: tomorrow, Trump will "remember" what was said very differently from Kim. But talking is still better than staring.
I think Dennis Rodman just put it all into perspective: if you think there's crazy inside the meeting room, check the sidewalk.
I'm sorry, but like I said back when Trump sprung this on us, I can't hate this. Yeah, he's an idiot and didn't prepare blah blah, but when everything has failed forever, sometimes "its so crazy it just might work," might. And then he'll fuck it up, but still...

Final thought: Hillary won the debate, but Alec Baldwin did a great job intensifying Trump's insanity. That was Alec Baldwin, right?
Not a single question about climate change in all 3 debates. Sad. No, really - sad.
Brilliant closing, Don: "vote for her and you get 4 more years of Obama" - a president with a 55% approval rating.
This was by far Hillary's best debate, bravo. But that jacket makes me want to ask her to cut me a slab of prime rib.
Until a month ago, Trump thought Aleppo was Omarosa's brother. #Debatenight
I'm trying to remember, when we invaded Iraq in 2003, yes of course it was all Hillary's doing, but wasn't there someone else...Bush maybe?
I never realized Hillary was the emperor of the world for the last 30 years, solely responsible for every bad thing that ever happened. Hmm.
Oh for fuck sake, if Trump was any more of a pussy he'd have to grab himself. #Debatenight
When will Trump realize that saying "Wrong!" makes him look like a #WhinyLittleBitch ?
Trump: I didn't even apologize to my wife! I wrote her a check, like always.
Right, the 73 yr old woman he groped on a plane wants "fame" - hoping to parlay this into a movie career and start dating James Franco.
Man, Hillary's debate prep was worth every minute, his predictable insults are getting overhead slammed. Also, Cubs up by 4.
Hey, Hillary, what about Trump's excellent plan to help small business by taking women furniture shopping?
Trump talking about creating millions of new jobs - Billy Bush at home saying, "Well you lost me mine!"
Hillary looks like a president. Like a president dealing with an idiot at a town hall. #Debatenight
This got nasty fast. But remember, when he goes low, I get high. #Debatenight
We know he's a five year old, but does he really have to say "You're the puppet!" "No, you are!" And this guy is still in the race? Jesus.
Is "bigly" a word? No, its not. That should be disqualifying itself!
Hillary doesn't want to put immigrants on buses, where they'll just be egged on by Billy Bush. #debatenight
Also, the sniffling kicks in when he starts talking about drugs. Sad.
So far, she is killing him, and he sounds like he knows he's toast. Also sounds like he's about 2 cigars away from an electrolarynx
Trump on fetuses: In 20 years, they'll be dating me!
Don't forget "Go to Hillary Clinton dot com" is code for "He's a lying sack of shit"
Telling that right off the bat, Trump makes the Supreme Court question about HIM! As always, he was insulted!Thats all that matters, people!
They're letting Hillary talk - its rigged!!
Debate prediction: Closest we get to talk of climate change tonight is when Trump mentions his daughter keeps getting hotter.
Looking forward to the Dorito-colored douchebag melting down tonight &amp; tweeting the play by play! Even POTUS agrees he's a #WhinyLittleBitch

Don't let Trump quit! You assholes voted for him, nominated him, handcuffed yourself to this dead hooker, now drag it to the finish line!

Word from inside the debate hall is Melania just left with Bill Clinton. #StillGotIt
However this comes out, I have so little respect for the electorate just that its this close. She's right, she shld be 50 points ahead.
If that meltdown ending with "I have the greatest temperment" hasn't convinced the idiot undecideds to vote Clinton, nothing can. #debates
Holy fuck, Hillary just did a Jim-from-The Office direct to camera take! Which Says. It. All. #debatenight
btw, you know a charge agst Trump is 100% provably true when he interrupts with "Wrong!" #debates
Trump: "Being in Iraq was a disaster, but we shld take the oil"WE WLD HAVE TO BE BACK IN IRAQ TO TAKE THE OIL! They won't give it to a drone
Christ, cld someone push back on America needs to be restored?To what, the unemployment rate over 10? the 2 wars? $5 gas? stock mkt at 7000?
to keep up with Trump's bullshit they had to outsource fact-checking to China. Sad.
Can we have some factchecking?! Stop and frisk did NOT reduce crime. No one is going to your website, Hillary, SAY IT NOW! You too Lester!
Hillary, for fuck's sake, he just said the country's fucked because of the Iraq war - a REPUBLICAN ENDEAVOR! Bush's war, not yours!
Trump: "I get audited every year" Yes, because you're a crook!!
I forgot from the Republican debates that Donald Trump is kind of a bus depot speed freak
OK,I hope she's playing rope-a-dope, and I do mean dope, because I'm getting tired of this vile nincompoop bullying and lieing and its early
Trump. Wearing a tie made in China, just sayin'
Trump proud of himself that he called her "Secretary Clinton" - as opposed to what, Bitchula?
Hillary dressed as bottle of hot sauce - a pander to Latinos?
shit, FoxNews just declared Trump the winner
Trump adjusting his Spanx right now, and one final pass with the can of Final Net...

Utah, Ga. in play:good! But Dems must ask why so many whole states wld vote for the baby-snatching crocodile if it had an R by name vs a Dem

Assassination threats aside,its just accepted when Trump repeats the wholly made up lie that Hillary wants to abolish 2nd Amendment. I wish!

More bad news, portions of Dr. Giggle's speech were plagiarized from a guy who sleeps in a shopping cart behind Pep Boys.
On a serious note, Don Jr reminds me very much of George W Bush when he was his father's hatchet man in 88.

Huh, new tactic here for Republicans - actually paying attention to facts? What the hell happened tonight? I'm bored. Who's dick is bigger??
Had to run out for a sec - do they still hate Mexicans?
Ben Carson endorsing Trump, wow. And Trump brags, of course: "so honored to be endorsed by the guy I called a child molester"
Also, not surprised Goofy endorsed Trump
Trump: "Only I can stop me from fucking America's workers!"
Not fair to ask Marco about Disney World! They know he's not tall enough to get on the rides!
Trump very "low energy" so far. No joy in it for him unless another of the monkeys is hurling poop his way.
Come on, get to the pissing contest. Although, after the last debate, that could literally come true

So, Kaisch's father carried a mailbag, and Cruz's washed dishes, or... Yeah, drifting. Drifting. Drifting....
Ben Carson's resting face is the same face the dog has when watching his owner have sex. See, drifting.
Come to think of it,Trump Tower DOES look like it was built by illegal Polish workers. Its that time in the debate where my mind is drifting
Wait,did Ben Carson just actually admit he fell asleep? Kasich looks like the college professor where you drop the class after the first day
Well, Trump is right about one thing: the world is laughing at us.
OK guys, we get it, Isis is bad, but first, America's greatest threat: Mexican cleaning ladies!
Ben Carson got in! Yeah! Now, back to looking like he's ignoring a rape on the subway...
How many times do we have to tip hats to G W Bush tonight? Hands down the worst sperm in American presidential history.
Ten minutes in and I've already forgotten Ben Carson is there - new record!
Bragging about an endorsement from Joe Arpaio is like bragging you went all the way with a party doll.We're in Texas, lets shit on Mexicans!
For fuck's sake,is there any more NON ISSUE than immigration? Its NetZero from Mexico,Americans won't do the jobs they do..SHUT UP ABOUT IT!

Watching the Dems right now, its just not as much fun watching sane people debate. But it sure makes you think one of them better win.
So my request for Obama to come on Real Time crashed their website, so if u can't get on keep trying - and thanks!!https://t.co/MHxRC1wO44
Wondering what to get me for my birthday? This would be nice https://t.co/WeroOIzqk8 https://t.co/ifiXBlELAU

@HBO #RealTime Returns Tomorrow w/@algore @NicolleDWallace @johnkrasinski @CornelWest @ralphreed https://t.co/akKGH9cJyF
OK, I can't take anymore. Surprised I took this much. But tomorrow...10 eastern...HBO...oh, there will be blood. And Al Gore is on!
Ben Carson is just in the wrong industry as a politician. His stock has fallen so fast Oil feels bad for him.
Christie: Just keep the bad people out. Shit, why didn't we think of that? Just keep out the ones who self-identify as bad! Duh!
So we're not the world's policeman, but we'll bomb and torture anyone anywhere for any reason? Should THEY be calling a policeman?
of all the issues they are infuriating about...lambasting Obama for not doing...exactly what he's already doing, always takes the cake
And one more thing: Do you get to say "New Yorkers are garbage people" if you're a Cuban from Calgary?
And by the way, what is a New York value? A studio apartment for $2,500 a month. Value - that's a steal!
Cruz to New York: Drop dead. If we didn't have the stupid electoral college, they couldn't write off THIRTY EIGHT STATES!
Of course Trump is for arming everyone, he's got the bulletproof hair!
"Isis does not get their guns from gun shows". True - they get them from the U S military. How many humvees did they capture in Mosul?
Yes, when Obama said Rednecks cling to their guns and their religion...way off on that one.
Oh Jeb, does Fla. really get to weigh in on guns? The one with the law "If you make me nervous, I get to shoot you?"
Well, that wasn't so bad. What, there's more? Shit.
I'm playing Words with Friends with John Kasich right now!
Christie: "I vetoed a ban on guns that can shoot down airplanes and through the doors of squad cars." Applause. Wheres Isis when u need 'em?
I've seen productions of Boys in the Band that weren't this bitchy.
Man, for a Canadian, Cruz fights nasty like a...well, like an American!
Trump to Cruz: "I'm not bringing a suit, I promise" - that's what he said to me before he sued me!
The crows at the republican debate just booed the Wall St Journal. Welcome to the Bird Sanctuary
Thank god, a commercial break. "Back to more making you shit your pants, after this word from Depends!"
Saying we need to rebuild our military is like saying county fairs need more fried foods
I like the audience shots - takes the myth that the Republicans are a bunch of angry old white people...and proves it
Christie: "If i'm president, Hillary won't get within ten miles of the white house"- great, more bridge closures
Love the way they now all say "Sure, the millionaires are doing great..." - and when I find the assholes who paved the way for that!...
Haha, Cruz made sure he was first to say Obama's a pussy because our sailors got released, on a question about the economy. He's the worst!
And what a great night for this - the perfect promotion for #RealTIme coming back from our winter break tomorrow night! Thanks, Assholes!
Sitting down for the Republican debate with my popcorn! Ok, not popcorn, liquor. It is the Republicans.
Tonight #GOPDebate Facebook and Twitter Live! https://t.co/U8VxIldqHs

Don't forget we're back January 15th! @HBO #RealTime https://t.co/jYF3A5CmKC
Happy birthday, #TedCruz,  you amoral putz, who keeps going up in the race - that's the Republicans for ya, the shit rises to the top
And some of these people - oy. Frank must be spinning. Is there such a thing as DISowning a song?
Watchin Sinatra100: Do country singers need to wear a cowboy hat w/ a tuxedo? Ur Garth Brooks, ur..other country guy, we get it, ur rednecks
Dr. Ben looked bad last night: Look everybody, I studied up, I know what a Shiite is now! And Trump didn't know what nuclear triad meant. Oy
Now that 1st 96 hours of the debate r over, quick question:a president's 1st job - keeping the ppl safe?Cuz they've been kinda vague on that
L A now? When are cops gonna get it: U can't just shoot people in the street! Folks have cameras now! Jeez, what were they doing BEFORE?
Ted Cruz is like a "Survivor" winner: forms an alliance with Trump only to lull him into getting killed off. Never forget, #CruzIsTheWorst
Oh I see, they believed the baby wld go to paradise too if they did the attack. Sure. C what we mean about bad ideas leading to bad actions?
Steven Weinberg said that, and that's how you get ppl who "always acted normal" (don't they always?) dropping a baby off to go to a massacre
"W/ or w/out religion U wld have good ppl doing good things &amp; evil ppl doing evil thingsBut 4 good ppl to do evil things that take religion"
Stop comparing random shooters to Islamic terrorists. Apples &amp; Oranges. One is bent on acquiring WMD to set off in America. End. of. Story.
I see the computer hackers Anonymous are going after Isis - if successful, it'd mean martyrs DO get screwed by virgins!
Happy TG everybody! I don't want to say my turkey is big, but a Russian fighter jet just entered its airspace!
Freed Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard called 'the Jewish James Bond' - I can see the movie: "Tomorrow Never Dies, It Just Keeps Complaining"
Liberal Values vs. Islam: @HBO #RealTime https://t.co/LRJLBS2yhs
#BenCarson is the black Sarah Palin. Says he loves the french, especially that pyramid in front of the Louvre where they keep their grain
As someone with the credentials of always keeping it real about Islam, let me say Trump's idea about registering Muslims is outrageous.
Republicans have Obama right where they want him on the Paris attacks: as usual, an abject failure to overreact on his part
Feisty fun time with Colbert tonight - one more Real Time on Friday and then I 'm off till new years eve in hawaii! Gone fishin'!
#ParisAttacks Lets make #TerrorismSociallyUnacceptable which means liberals standing firm for Liberal principles!
Yeah, Trump talking about nukes, i gotta go or i won't sleep tonight. Peace out!
OK...now we're getting to the foreign affairs part, which, if possible, they know even less about. I can feel me going for the remote...
Biggest applause is to upbloat even more the military budget. Hard to say who's the bigger tools, the candidates or the audience.
Jeb Bush: Should i even stick around or, maybe beat the traffic?
Herman Cain was a joke for saying 9-9-9! Ben Carson is serious, cuz he says 10-10-10. Is there lead paint in those flag pins? #GOPDebate
Hey moderators, stop asking how they'd pay for it! DIdn't you hear, My tax plan lets you eat whatever you want and lose weight!
Cruz: "There are more words in the IRS code than the Bible". Yes, but none of them are in favor of slavery or ethnic cleansing.
And "Let's try the one thing in healthcare we've never tried - the free market!" You see why i'm drunk now?!
Carly: "I have led innovative businesses!" Into the ground. And then they fired me.
I'm doing a shot every time Carly lies. I'm drunk. #GOPDebate
Kasich and Bush, gotta give 'em credit on immigration, trying to start a "Republicans who believe in Reality" movement. Good luck with that.
Trump's immigration plan is like a bar at closing time: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here! #GOPDebate
Trump: "We are a country of laws" Thankfully, bankruptcy laws
Ben Carson: Stop smearing me with these unfounded accusations that i'm not a murderous psychopath!
Carly, how do you explain Dems creating more jobs? Carly: Let me tell you a story about some lady. #GOPDebate
Have you noticed they always sit the three black people behind the moderators?
I think this is Jeb Bush's fourth Do or Die moment. Let's just say he's not Doing.
Kasich said "thrice" - is that too fancy a word? I think it might be! #NotaWelder
btw, fact check: average wage for welder, 37k; philosopher professor, 89k. TongueStuckOutEmoji.
This is boring. Let's get to the part where Ben Carson attacks his mom with a hammer.
Marco really studied his flash cards for this one! More welders, less philosophers! Yeah, that's,um, vaguely anti people i think i hate!
gotta give it to Trump, he doesn't pander: 'Minimum wage? Fuck you, get rich or die, next question.'
My first question for the debaters: This is on Fox Business channel, is that NON-LIBERAL enough for your pussy asses?
Is it me, or does Reince Priebus look like that guy at the funeral home who comes in with the casket catalogue?
About to live tweet the Repub debate, and the big question, How long will i last before i say "Fuck these assholes, i feel physically ill!"?
#GOPDebate https://t.co/NiXBwwo7CA
Did Jeb Bush really answer the question "Would U kill baby Hitler?"? Yes, he did. Why do ppl get mad at me for saying its a stupid country?

Huckabee: Eradicate diseases and you fix medicare, duh! As a former fatty, he should know, the patient has to cooperate a little!
I'm not losing faith, but this lineup is not getting it done tonight - and the Mets could use some hits too!!
Christie just ate Bush's lunch! And probably others. Now this is the inning we have to get some runs!!
When in doubt, shit on the federal gov't. Fantasy football? Fuck the federal gov't!
Trump is right, Bush is low energy. He always looks like the guy who's in the car reading while his wife is in a store shopping.
Debt relief? Fuck debt relief, we need long relief - get somebody up in the bullpen!
The big takeaway so far from watching the debate between innings? Not. Missing. Anything.
Way to score!!! No, not you Carson you crazy head case, Murphy!!
oh my god did i just hear Ted Cruz say something awesome that i agree with? Yes. The media is even stupider than the pols. Who's on first?
deGrom is mowing them down! And Kasich was pretty good mowing down Trump &amp; Carson on living in FantasyLand! Go Kasich! Wait, i mean Go Mets!
The only way this debate is going to be survivable is if the Mets get out to a big lead. Then i don't care what Trump says. Like now.
Oh lord,another debate with more STUPID QUESTIONS?! Asking "What's your weakness?" is an invitation to a humblebrag, fools! Back to the Mets
You mean prophecies from 80s movies are NOT reliable?? Congratulations @Mets and one more series to go!

Oh fuck, their best friend, Ben Gazi...I can't stand these assholes for one more minute - peace out!
I think #BenCarson might have inhaled a little too much anesthesia
20 minutes on valet parkers without I D while flames from wildfires lick the walls of the Reagan library. HOW BOUT A CLIMATE QUESTION?????
When does one of these assholes have the guts to call Reagan out for his amnesty for Mexicans?
For the first time in this campaign, Trump is humbled (by Carly) and looked apologetic and not true to what he believes. Start of the end?
Carly: I'd urge every American to watch these doctored, heavily edited, manipulated tapes and come to the false conclusion I have!
How about asking the one woman on the stage about Planned Parenthood
Quick question: When #TedCruz shaves in the morning, how does he avoid spitting in the mirror? #GOPDebate
Bloodthirsty, factfree belligerence: Yayyy! Rand Paul's reasoned restraint: polite smattering.
Dead Nixon just called Scott Walker: I want my lip sweat back!
Carly explaining Republican diplomacy: I'm not talking to you! We insult you,and then you do what we say! Why is everyone overthinking this?
When #BenCarson speaks, i keep waiting for one of those Lunesta butterflies to fly by
"I want to talk about serious, non-personal issues, but PizzaFace and Fatso here won't let me!"
Don't adjust your sets, Scott Walker's face really looks like that
The conspiracy of delusion about how Obama wrecked America is astounding. Hello, unemployment is lower than Reagan ever had it!
Two minutes in, and its kindergarden slams about who's ugly. Even professional wrestlers are like, Guys, c'mon...a little dignity.
#ChrisChristie: Take the camera off me. American public: Good idea.
To sum up opening statements: God bless America, too bad its such a shithole. #GOPDebate
Jeb, lame opening. But, when he sees a plane inside a building he thinks of his brother, so he's a little off his game. #GOPDebate
#BenCarson needs to chug a little red bull before the show. Nice gesture tho that he offered to separate Christie's conjoined chins
Trump used to hang out with serious people like @LouFerrigno and @LaToyaJackson and now he has to share a stage with these losers. #Sad
Must say, #ChrisChristie looks good tonight, he really - oh, wait, sorry, that's Air Force One
1st off, Air Force One in the background is confusing: CNN viewers are thinking, Wow, they found the missing plane!
Back by popular demand, i will be live-tweeting the debate! And its the best live tweet, the other ones are terrible and their numbers stink

Do these morons even know the diff between Sunni and Shiite? Or what the countries in the middle east are? They'd be bombing Arianna Grande
What about pimps and prostitutes? Huckabee wants to fund social security on their backs? Could work, they're already on their backs
Christie just broke the "Whatever you do, keep pandering" rule. He's toast. And he's fat, so make a toast joke, I'm getting tired.

Ben Carson doubts HIllary will be the Dem nominee?? Ben, do you still have your brain-cutting tools? And a mirror? OK, lie down...#GOPDebate

Easy there, Ben Carson, they let you into their country club, don't get uppity now. #PostRacialAmerica

Sorry, just got to say it one more time: John Boener is a smug, orange fuckface and I hate him more than...oh wait, Joni Ernst is coming on
"I know, because i won both of them". That was awesome. And why they hate him. Well, one reason why they hate him, ahem.
How U can be agst "I'd like to stop earth from melting" is beyond me.I'd like to punch them in their smug faces often but on this issue most
I know this has been covered before, and not to pile on Boener, but on my TV he is actually darker than Obama. Why?
Here it comes, the only thing the 2 parties can agree on is more stupid bombing. Watch Boener light up now. Not that he's not already lit.
Does Boener have to look like he's getting a colonoscopy everytime Obama says something good about America? I thought Repubs loved America?

Popularity of gay marriage has really shot up in Calif! Can't believe its not legal here - after all, we have a bear right on our flag.
OK you're right, enuf about the pope. I guess as former Catholic, I just want to leave him a message. Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
Will he still get the discount at the Vatican Gift shop, stuff like that. As he himself said, Don't hate the praya, hate the game!
So touchy about Pope-y! I'm just wishing him well in this difficult time of going from infallible to just another shmuck.
Just sayin, based on how Catholics behave, Bennie was taken less seriously than the sign in the men's room not to throw things in the toilet
That's not fair. They don't get arrested.
So long, Pope-y! Been a great run,of a billion Catholics ignoring everything he said to do, and everyone he knows getting arrested for rape.

Fun time on Conan tonight -even tho something unfunny was going on at Big Bear during taping. Are we gonna have an O J split screen for SOU?

re Hunting: yes, i know factory farming is often even more horrendous,and of course i would have mentioned that if i had more than 140 chara
Stop saying we have to protect hunters - why? There's food in stores now.The slippery slope is the one that leads back to this outdated bs
Obama speech: step forward (minus the religious bs), but still can't say the word "guns"; like the NRA literally has guns to our heads
Sorry but prayers and giving your kids hugs fix nothing; only having the balls to stand up to our insane selfish gun culture will.

This week John McCain missed a security briefing with answers on Benghazi to hold a press conference demanding answers on Benghazi
Just read Twilight written by Mormon - makes sense, cuz like Romney its about a semihuman who lives in fantasy world and sucks on our blood
Like the way Barry went after McCain and his girlfriend Lindsay today - winning 2nd term less like mandate and more like being denied parole
#keepPetraeusOnTheJob - Isn't what's going on in Somalia and Pakistan more important than what's going on in his pants?
Unless he was fucking Mata Hari as well, I still don't see why Petraeus had to go
Big question these days is Can the Republicans evolve? Wld be helpful to believe in evolution first
Is it true that the original name of Paula Broadwell's Petraeus biography was "Is It All In?"
Mitt won all the states where "Lincoln" is showing as "Scary Movie 5"

Great victory for the people last night;people also still idiots: see Prop 37,they voted AGAINST knowing what they're putting in their mouth
Since Obama won almost all the swing states, and we somehow elected them our deciders, shouldn't that be considered a mandate?
Also a classy speech, but message was clear: little girls with leukemia die under Repub.s, so its a good thing I pulled it out. Kinda true.
I'm pulling for Michele Bachman in MN - can't lose ALL my punchlines in one night!
Pretty classy speech, Mitt. Loved the line goading the "job creators" to get off their selfish hoarding asses and create some jobs.
Tea Party has now cost the Republicans 5 senate seats. My next donation is going to them.
Karl Rove in a huge public spat right now with math. I know its comfy in the bunker, but at some point you have to come up for cyanide pills
Well that was a million dollars well spent.
Mitt to his underwear: "Magic my ass!!"
This victory that the Jackie Robinson of American politics is cruising to is more impt than the first;1 term=failure; he had to be a success
Bad night for rich idiots. I just wish Conneticut had more elective offices for Linda McMahon to not win.

O Reilly just said people vote for Obama cuz they "want stuff", then cited blacks, Latinos and women. White men in US? TOTALLY SELF-RELIANT!

Obama: high marks for Sandy, but no pleasing some people - today Kanye with cast of Jersey Shore: "Obama doesn't care about orange people"
Candidates exhausted at this point - Mitt got so disoriented today he started to state where he actually stands on an issue
Hope u all remembered to set ur clocks back an hour last night. And if u vote Republican on Tuesday another 40 years.
Just remember next prez prolly appoints Supreme Ct justice. In case it's Romney might want to start pulling out a little earlier.
Just landed in Vegas - shows tonite and tomorrow at The Orleans last 2 stand ups before election! All Mitt Romney jokes must go!
Now it's real - just did last show before election! Now it's either a 2nd Obama term or one of six possible Mitt Romneys

#MittRomney hates Assad cuz he fooled us into thinking he was a moderate and what sort of duplicitous shit wld do that?
I'm tired of every Republican politician being a medical supergenius on vaginas. I want to hear gynecologists talk about the national debt
Assclown/Disgrace to NYC Donald Trump always bragging he's worth billions so his 5 mil offer to Obama really quite chincy. #Stupidcheapfuck
OK, one last try: We have fewer Andrews Sisters and Ritz Brothers than we did in 1944.  So glad we're done with THAT!
Mitt keeps taking issue with being criticized tonight - did they tell him this is a debate?
First debate, all agreed, Obama lost; second one, i say he won, but Romney not trounced. But this one? Only bubbledwellers can say Mitt won
OK Mitt, one more try: we have fewer catapults and barrels of boiling oil than we had in the crusades.
Shorter version of Romney: Me strong. Obama weak. Hulk smash.
You're losing, Mitt - bring up the fact that we have fewer knives and rocks than we did during the French and Indian War
To clarify, Mitt is for moving heaven and earth, but only in regards to mining
Yes yes yes! Hit em with "I wldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden" and "I'd ask Pakistan's permission" - Mitt, you were just WRONG!
Oh no he din't - Romney said his ultimate BubbleFact, "Apology Tour" right in front of the guy who NEVER WENT ON ONE
I've seen wider ideological differences between Jehovah's Witnesses
I can't be the only one who's surprised to find out Buster Posey is a white guy. Sorry, flipped to the game.
To Obama's point, I'm thinking our F-15s could defeat a statistically larger number of Red Barons
THAT was the best yet! "We have these things called aircraft carriers, governor, where planes land on them".  Cathartic, Barry.
Bob Scheiffer, could you ask about what's IN the military budget? If people knew specifics,"I wouldn't cut nuttin'" wouldn't sound so good
Jobs, teachers, education - gentlemen, please, can we get back to killing foreigners?
That's an amazingly specific number Mitt keeps pulling out of his ass, 12 million new jobs. But fellas, this is the foreign policy debate!
Mitt's entire debate strategy: What he just said, but from a white guy
Its good they agree armed Americans shld be involved with everyone, everywhere. We loved armed intervention like Paula Dean loves butter.
Aside from talking points, Mitt doesn't know his Assad from a hole in the ground
Mitt, you do know that most of America thinks Mali is one of Obama's daughters, right?
Ha! Obama doing my editorial from a week ago: forget ideology, what about just BEING WRONG!!
"Kill our way out of this mess" is the theme of every American movie not about talking animals or weddings
Scheiffer's first question regurgitated right wing talking points.  But he probably lives there in Boca.
Trouble already:  Mitt says he wants to impose sanctions on "Romnesia"
Can't believe i have to tear myself away from the Giants-Cardinals game for this shit again. I mean, isn't debating exciting?
I luv people at town halls who ask Obama the same basic whiny question: I voted for u... and I'm still me!!!!

"Govt does not create jobs" - tell that to anyone who works in anything related to the internet.
nothing moves voters like foreign currency devaluation
If the tea party is still voting for this immigrant loving, non tax cutting, birth control loving protectionist they care only about winning
A gun question? What country does this lady think she's living in?
Candy checks Romney on how Obama DID call the Libya attackers terrorists! Obama applauded, Romney shown to be a liar. TKO
Fact checkers could have nucleur weapons, they still couldn't get Romney to stop saying "apology tour"
Up until 3 weeks ago, most Americans thought Benghazi was a TV doctor
whoa, Candy just had to tell Romney to SIT THE FUCK DOWN! I'd say he had too much caffeine, but we know that can't be it
If Romney gave some of these answers in primary debates, crowd wld have devoured him; nothing but a clump of magic undies and black hair dye
Romney: Some of my favorite servants are immigrants!
thought bubble over Romney's head "Say, this Obama fella is starting to make a lot of sense..."
i wonder how long it took some of these undecided voters to decide on an outfit to wear
Not cool: after Obama and Romney cross paths on stage, Romney checks for his wallet
"Governor, you're the last person whos gonna get tough on China" finally, Barry seems to not be worrying about looking like angry black man
Great question, how Mitt is different than Bush. Answer: not! His 5 point plan is same as Bush's. Which was also McCain's. See a pattern?
Do i love women? Golly, my great grandfather married eight!
Wow, Mitt had whole binders full of woman. Just like a Morman.
Batman style graphics should be popping up: POW! SLAM!
Mitt's tax plan is like his underwear: magic
Mitt has gone a subway stop past confident to Arrogant -"of course my numbers add up, i was in business" -businessmen don't ever lie!
Mitt knows anytime you tick off a 5 point plan people thinks its good. Doesn't matter what the 5 are, one can be taxing refrigerator magnets
Halleluhia! Nurses and drywallers won't have to pay tax on their dividends!
Both of them are trying to roll over Candy Crowley.  And that can't be easy.
Mitt is the kind of prep school bully who tells the president of the United States "you'll get your chance".
Amazing to think Romney is old enough to be Obama's dad...hey wait a minute
Mitt Romney is a fracking liar
Romney just totally lost the bird vote
first sign of Obama success: Andrew Sullivan loosening ligature around neck
Welcome back, Black Ninja.
first lie: Romney is not for keeping Pell grants
100 people around stage - Mitt sees more than that at his breakfast table
Settling in with the popcorn for another live tweet debate play by play in a couple of hours...stay tuned
The economy IS getting better - I saw a guy today with a sign Will Work For Organic Produce
I really think this election comes down to one thing - is Mitt Romney too white to be president?

O fuck #LindsayLohan is voting for Romney. And u know what they say, if you've lost Lindsay Lohan..U can locate her with the ankle bracelet
Finally, if Obama had been this strong, the election would be over now.  I predict he will be in the next two, so off the ledge, Sullivan!
Oh just shup up all of ya, i want to watch football. All that's left is for Biden to throw Ryan a handkerchief:"Here, clean yourself up kid"
Ryan is the kind of guy who shakes your hand extra hard to let you know he's been working out.
Man, Joe Biden is clean and articulate!
And btw Martha, what a truly horrible question this is on abortion and Catholics.
Child, please! your running mate changed his position on abortion twice in 24 hrs this week! Shorter waiting periods for actual abortions!
Ryan's is winning who knows to hydrate more. That's a big tell when you keep going to the water. But flopsweat don't replace itself!
Let's just say it: even in HD, Biden's plugs look pretty good
Ryan's hair is sweating.
I'm actually starting to feel sorry for Ryan. But it wld be cool if Biden made him cry
Why do Romney/Ryan keep arguing for Woodrow Wilsons's navy?
Joe is not afraid to interrupt Ryan. Or himself.
Besides the words, Joe's face is winning
This isn't the kind of "feeling the burn" Ryan enjoys
This Biden guy is awesome! I hope he keeps that nice sleepy black guy on the ticket!
Hello 9 1 1? There s an old man beating a child on my tv
"Let me tell you about the Mitt Romney i know" - too late, he's changed again
Roethlisberger must get the ball out of his hand quicker. Sorry, wrong channel
Biden is hitting in one answer all the things Obama left out in the entire first 90 minute debate
Debates are better when they're sitting, they talk more like people talk when they're just sitting around. Beers would make it even better.
Republicans sure have a point about Benghazi - what kind of clueless incompetent lets Al Qaida attack Americans on Sept 11?
Is someone going to ask Eddy Munster when the president ever "apologized for our values"?
Raddatz already WAY better than the last guy
"Malarky!' - yes, Joltin Joe taking it to Lyin Ryan! Take note, Barry!
Hello, under Bush: 3000 Americans killed by Al Quada on American soil; under Obama, 4 Americans killed in Libya. Next question.
Excellent start, Ryan doesn't literally have a pack of lies
Please don't let first question be about Raddatz wedding gift
Debate must be about to start, Chris Mathews breathing into paper bag
Ok ok I'll live tweet the debate tomorrow! Somehow Biden got to be the silver tongued savior and Obama the gaffing doofus...
Newsweek has "Heaven is Real" on the cover - if this is what it takes to stay in business as a newsmagazine just stop. Better dead than sad

Read some strange theories today re Barry - like he threw the debate on purpose. Right, like he's the Chinese ping pong team
@KingsThings LarryKingNOW part 2 interview online (video via:@OraTV) http://t.co/2FPRBmb4
Postmortem even worse than debate! Now we know what Romney looks like fired up. And what Michael Jackson looked like on the diprovan
final takeaway: Mitt finally shook the etch-a-sketch- the moderate re-emerged. He flip-flops like he's been tasered, but hey, he's a winner!
Looks like my pre-thought about Romney knocking it out of the park was accurate, or so says the media that's so in the tank for Obama
Pundits already weighing in that Romney won. They're cheering on Planet Kolob!
my rating: Romney won the debate, Obama had the facts on his side, and Lehrer sucked. Next debate, get @SethMacFarlane to host!
i must say, of all the Romneys i've seen, this Debate Romney is my favorite
Closing statements, Mitt won the coin toss. And put the coin in the Cayman Islands
Mitt: "we have best health record in the world" - then why does the UN rank us 37? Outside the bubble, there are facts you know
Obama made a lot of great points tonight. Unfortunately, most of them were for Romney
i can't believe i'm saying this, but Obama looks like he DOES need a teleprompter
Hey Lehrer, you're the fucking ref, stop letting the Mittbot bully you - he can't fire YOU
that was the line of the night so far: is Romney keeping his plans secret because they're too good?
Phil Spector may be a murderer, but he was right about putting strings on Let It Be. Sorry, my mind wanders when Romney talks
Barry: less looking down making notes (u look like you're hanging your head in shame) and more eye contact. Look at Mitt like he's a nut!
ok, this drives me nuts when Mitt says healthcare works at state level but not federal - do people get sick differently by state? NO!!!
healthcare: if Obama can't win this round, Eddie Futch has to stop the fight
that president Obama sure is smart, but i'm not sure if i'm gonna take his class next semester
Barry, come on - lift up your shirt and show him the gun!
Romney looks more confident and energetic - he's about a minute away from holding Obama down and cutting his hair.  This better be ropeadope
Barry, stop nodding at Mitt when he's lecturing you, it looks like he's right and you're chastened!
Mitt will stop the subsidy to PBS! Well, that should solve the deficit problem!
"math, common sense, and history" - that's a triple whammy against Republicans
Why does Jim Lehrer keep trying to stop them from debating? Gentlemen, please, this debate is no place for debating!
"his big bold idea is never mind" - Zinger! A hit, a palpable hit!
Obama's not looking like he came for a job interview, Romney so far does
pls tweet me what that look on Romney's face is when Obama's talking-holding in a  fart? About to cry?Sorry he started the whole damn thing?
I liked Romney better 2 weeks ago when he was five shades darker talking to Latinos.  Now against Obama he looks paler than ever. He's Zelig
"clean coal" is not something that exists. Its like "cold fire"

Besides being more calm and knowledgable in crisis, doncha think the bad guys know Ninja Badass Obama is the one who hunts their kind down?
In hindsight, watching Bush "in action" on 9/11 (or was it inaction?)he looks even worse than I remembered. Cuz we were used to his idiocy.

We always need to 'stop spending $ we don't have' the second they're out of office after they've spent it all and driven us into a ditch
Repubs never tire of the anecdotal, one in a million success story that means nothing to the vast majority. And also curly fries.

I think #ChrisChristie is an excellent speaker, but I was surprised that halfway thru his argument collapsed. And the stage didn't.
Loved #AnnRomney's speech especially the part about how Mitt can't release taxes cuz her horse ate them. And then Christie ate the horse.
Looking fwd to #AnnRomney speech humanizing Mitt, esp part about how Mitt is exhausting in bed cuz he can never stick to one position

#MicheleObama will give comm. address at 3 colleges - Fox has asked for 24 hrs to figure out why this makes her a snob and angry black woman
In 91 Mormons baptized T Jefferson and Sally Hemmings and "sealed" them as married - its insane, but a great premise for a Tyler Perry movie
#DickCheney had his first heart attack at 37, for all those younger people who think buying health insurance shldnt be mandated.
