@QueerEye @CopeKills
@CopeKills @andyfrasco Compton has Kendrick and Wyoming has Frasco
@Frans_Stal Did you watch it?
@mrmarkmillar So young 😭😭
@ColtonHeatherly Totally. That is helpful too. I think there are MANY things that need to be done. Not just one. It’s good having a civil conversation about it
@ColtonHeatherly @dennisbaxley How can you say Americans are soft? After all the lives that have been taken. That’s just extremely upsetting for the people who have lost family and friends
@ColtonHeatherly If he walked in there with a hammer. No one dies. With a knife? One, maybe 2. Which is terrible, but it’s not 17. Gums are a problem. Bad people who get guns are a problem. It’s all a problem.
HEARTBREAKING. IMPACTFUL. https://t.co/CZ599gGAPw
@DanMontani @dennisbaxley Maybe not... but let’s make it near impossible for them to get that gun.
@DanMontani @dennisbaxley I’m just asking that we need to make it WAY tougher for people to get these guns. We need to try. We need to try MANY things.
AR-15 is NOT an assault rifle, that is my bad. But it’s definitely a scary bad no-no gun that can hurt people. That’s the point
@DanMontani @dennisbaxley Thanks! I also love The Patriots. We are literally watching the greatest qb of all time. But I won’t stop talking about guns until I feel like it’s time. Much respect
@Ricarlos @dennisbaxley I’m loving this idea!!
@Ricarlos @dennisbaxley I’m very okay with a white male terrorist going into a school with a spoon 🤷🏿‍♂️
@MasoTom2 @dennisbaxley Sickening. I am sorry.
Florida state senator @dennisbaxley on banning AR-15s: "Spoons are used to eat stuff to kill yourself with obesity, but we're not picking up spoons to get rid of obesity."    Did this guy just compare a spoon to an assault rifle......... https://t.co/ngO1MUtdJL
@mrDaveKrumholtz @DineshDSouza @jack What a fucking cunt.
@MatthewKoma @AlexAllTimeLow Guys no. I don’t want to see anyone get hurt.
@Christine_Ko @ConstancaNobre @GreatIndoorsCBS This is cool!!
@andyfrasco @WonderTheMovie Watch Queer Eye. Right @CopeKills ?
@QueerEye IS SO POSITIVE AND UPLIFTING AND THE FAB 5 MAKE EVERYONE FEEL LIKE THEY DESERVE LOVE AND HAPPINESS. Everyone in America should watch. Thx
@QueerEye @jvn @mirai_nagasu @Adaripp @CopeKills
@QueerEye @CopeKills
A lot of “GUNS ARENT THE PROBLEM, GUNS ARE SAFE UNTIL A HUMAN PICKS IT UP” arguments I see online. That’s the DUMBEST SHIT IVE EVER HEARD. GUN CONTROL NOW PLEASE.

@JFantastico6 I retweeted mine, because I don't want to send the wrong message. Want those two to be clear next to each other. Thank you for helping me
@JFantastico6 It's all good!
@Omnistic I can't see his side on this. And I'm very okay with that.
@JFantastico6 Truth! If people continue now.
@JFantastico6 I was saying , NOW if you still support this man, you support this. Not if you did prior.
@JFantastico6 Please let me know what you mean? I don't want to spread hate, educate me?
So now it's pretty straight forward right? If you support Trump, you support Nazis. The KKK. This is insane.
@MrsJennGomez Honestly , it's been silent from anyone trying to defend him over here. I guess that's one decent thing outta this bullshit.

"The pizzas always me" SO DUMB SO FUNNY #TheGreatIndoors
@MaryMNation excitement and nerves!!
Wow. I'm a straight up crazy person dumbass in that scene. It was so fun to play. #TheGreatIndoors
"Errrybody chill"  got wilder every take because @shaunbrown enjoyed it WAY too much #TheGreatIndoors
I enjoyed poking Joel with my pinky, because even when Clark thinks he's being tough, he looks like an idiot. #TheGreatIndoors
@shaunbrown "jack, I mean dad I mean Clark" is the low key super hero joke of the episode #TheGreatIndoors
I hear my dad laughing every episode. It haunts me. #TheGreatIndoors
Hitting @shaunbrown and @Christine_Ko on the face had the audience ROLLING but they couldn't keep the full laugh in #TheGreatIndoors
@Christine_Ko @MrKenKirby TOOK IT BACK CUZ U DRANK SO MUCH
....the night before. Found it on show day. Can't do shit without our amazing writers #TheGreatIndoors
This next "Cool Clark" scene took very long to figure out. Never knew how to make it right, until the writers crushed it and re wrote....
@lady_writers I NEED to hear this.
@TinalynM thank you!! Hard to choose, but this tv schedule really gives me freedom to make my music
My main goal is to just try to make @shaunbrown laugh during scenes #TheGreatIndoors
This may have been the episode I realized my voice can go that deep, and I may use it A LOT more after. #TheGreatIndoors
I play weak on the show , but am strong in real life I promise I can lift things with my strength #TheGreatIndoors
