ICYMI, I joined @NBC10_Sam over the holiday weekend to discuss the effects the #TrumpShutdown will have in #RI and across the nation. https://t.co/ZLfYaqXuUQ
Most Americans aren’t behind the President’s border wall proposal because it will be ineffective and expensive. The sooner the President comes to terms with that, the sooner we can end the #TrumpShutdown and get back to work. https://t.co/kpZpOEDLH2
Wishing a very #MerryChristmas to all celebrating today! https://t.co/BSoOCmZprp
This is unacceptable. By prolonging the shutdown and refusing to cooperate with Congress, the Trump Administration is only causing greater financial and economic uncertainty for countless American families. We must work together to reopen the government. https://t.co/efcAzAAxkg
The #TrumpShutdown will have very real consequences for federal employees, contractors, farmers, small business owners and countless hardworking American families. It’s time to stop the political gamesmanship and pass a bipartisan funding bill. https://t.co/K96DBeCqJp
President Trump wanted a government shutdown, and now he has one. Just four days before Christmas, he is delivering a lump of coal to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, contractors, and their families who may go unpaid.  https://t.co/B7uYlkWmVr https://t.co/3zlUGcSaOc

These @SADDnation RI high school students spend their free time empowering their peers to confront the pressures facing them. Thanks for stopping by to brief me on your admirable work. #SADD18 https://t.co/RwCopt4Uqg
The right to vote is central to the integrity of our democracy. However, that right is currently threatened by gerrymandering, voter purges and more. I’ve cosponsored the Voting Rights Advancement Act so we can #RestoreTheVOTE
The @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. I’m supporting legislation that will bring it back so everyone has access to a free and open Internet. #SaveTheInternet https://t.co/J7KL3aNbJt
Happy National #LGBTEqualityDay! As we recognize the historic #SCOTUS rulings for the LGBT community, we also remember there is still more work to be done in the fight for full equality. #Pride2018 https://t.co/s6syYqqNRD
Deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court #TravelBan ruling today. As made clear during my questions of then Secretary Kelly, there is no specific intelligence backing this ban, and it can only be viewed as an expression of the President’s ill will toward Muslims.
On Friday, I introduced legislation w/ @BennieGThompson @RepPeteKing to improve emergency preparedness and response planning for people with #disabilities and ensure they have a seat at the table. https://t.co/LJDHukAPdN https://t.co/3oifQ7NUnZ
Best wishes to the @RIStatePolice, @RINationalGuard, and @CyberScout for a successful RI Joint Cyber Task Force meeting today. Thanks for your hard work protecting our critical infrastructure from #cyber threats.
The finest #submarines in the world begin their journey right here in Rhode Island @GDElectricBoat. Thrilled to be here at Quonset Point as EB breaks ground on a major expansion project that will create local jobs and further ramp up submarine construction. https://t.co/5F8BYRuHSY

Best of luck to @RefugeeDream Center for a successful #WorldRefugeeDay celebration event – your work is as important ever!
It was a pleasure attending @alsa_ri’s 22nd Annual Evening of Hope last night to honor @SenWhitehouse and Chapter President J.R. Pagliarini. https://t.co/acWnqdcneQ
Sorry I can’t make it today, but I’m thrilled to see that @FamilyServiceRI recognizes the importance of internet safety and is investing a full day for #cybersecurity training!
Yesterday, Republicans passed a Farm Bill that guts SNAP benefits and other programs that support the health and welfare of low-income Americans. Here is my full statement: https://t.co/ROxeOdTDFh https://t.co/IJbBFlg9pf
I’m proud to support the @NOH8Campaign – everyone deserves the same rights and respect regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. #Pride2018 https://t.co/OZujnEk7lD
The President’s decision to revoke the #NationalOceanPolicy is deeply misguided and rejects years of bipartisan work to improve the health of ocean and coastal ecosystems. Rather than focus on short-term resource extraction, we need to preserve our oceans for future generations.
It’s #NationalSelfieDay, and what better way to commemorate the occasion than with this #TBT selfie with my buddy @SenWhitehouse! https://t.co/oETYEvhsuO
On the #LongestDay, our thoughts are with those living with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers. Thank you to the @alzassociation @alzassocri and everyone working to #EndALZ https://t.co/XwBfUPx6hg
The President admitted the inhumanity of his family separation policy, yet he did not present a real solution nor mention the thousands of kids who have already been torn from their parents. How will we reunite these families if DHS doesn’t know where they are? #WhereAreTheGirls?
Last night, I spoke on the House floor to recognize LGBT #PrideMonth. Let’s keep celebrating our differences and promoting a culture of acceptance. #Pride2018 https://t.co/qD7L5LM6fr
This is a crisis of the President’s own making, and he can stop it immediately by ending his “zero tolerance policy” of jailing families fleeing for their lives.
I’m glad the President recognized his family separation policy is inhumane, but this executive order is no solution at all. We don’t want three year-olds separated from their mothers, but we don’t want them in jail either.
Thanks @RITELL_ESL Executive Director Flavia Baker for stopping by and for your hard work to support English language learners in Rhode Island. #ELT https://t.co/zNX26bPo6y

Children should not be ripped from the arms of their parents. It’s time for the President to take responsibility and stop the separation of families at our border. #KeepFamiliesTogether #FamiliesBelongTogether
RI has the ninth highest rate of opioid-related deaths in the country. Proud that my legislation w/ @RepPeteKing to help prevent these substances from coming into our communities passed the House yesterday.    https://t.co/kiKokRLZP6 https://t.co/L7lbyDs5YJ
This very minute terrified children are crying in cages at our border and the President refuses to do anything to stop it. It’s time to end this policy and turn the page on one of the saddest chapters in American history. #KeepFamiliesTogether https://t.co/TeLgWXQmXQ
Headed to the House floor to debate the bill I introduced with @RepPeteKing to combat fentanyl trafficking. The opioid overdose crisis is tearing at the fabric of RI communities, and #HR5762 will ensure these drugs are caught before they reach our streets. https://t.co/NrmqxEGtmM
#Alzheimers disease affects millions of Americans and their families. Thanks @alzassocri for stopping by the office today to share your stories and for your continued advocacy. #EndALZ https://t.co/9gZY2TaWzB
I am proud to cosponsor the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act that will halt this terrible practice. While the President could change his policy with a simple phone call, he refuses to do so. As such, we must pass this legislation to end the humanitarian crisis he has created.
The President’s policy of separating families - and make no mistake, it’s his policy – is utterly cruel and inhumane. Ripping crying children from their parents’ arms and keeping them in cages like animals is morally reprehensible and he must end this policy immediately.
Great meeting with representatives from @PanCAN @PanCANRI to discuss their efforts to advance research and support patients with #pancreaticcaner. #PANCaware https://t.co/5TFEB1ycOB

Gun violence remains an epidemic in this country, and we should not be weakening laws governing the transfer of machine guns. Unfortunately, Republicans are doing just that by sneaking in an amendment to the defense bill we’re debating today. #FY19NDAA #NDAA #GunSafety

The fact is that the nuclear deal is working. Today’s announcement is a crisis of the President’s own making, and he should reconsider and rejoin the JCPOA before our national security is further damaged.
Walking away from the JCPOA abandons our allies, weakens our credibility, and harms our ability to foster similar diplomatic agreements in the future. Worse, it undermines the central goal of the agreement - to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Once again, the President is threatening U.S. national security and international stability. The Iran nuclear deal provides for comprehensive monitoring by the international community, and there remains no evidence that Iran is violating its commitments.
So many educators have had a profound impact on my life, like my 6th grade teacher, Lizbeth Larkin. On National Teacher Day, let’s celebrate educators across America who enrich students’ lives every day, helping them learn, grow, and thrive at every stage of life. #ThankATeacher

Sorry to miss today’s @NFSAorg event to highlight new incentives making it easier for property owners to install fire sprinklers. I've long supported the installation of #firesprinklers to prevent tragedies like The Station nightclub fire from happening again.
The anniversary of The Station nightclub fire is a difficult time for many RIers. It’s been 15 yrs since that tragic night, &amp; it’s important to continue to remember the loved ones who were taken from us that day &amp; support one another as we move forward. https://t.co/6i72nSgy9g

We need to enact equitable and fiscally responsible #taxreform, which the Republican #taxbill fails to accomplish on all accounts. https://t.co/tUXxsUbwG0
The Republican #taxbill favors the wealthy and large corporations while raising taxes on tens of millions of Americans. We need to pass fair #taxreform for all, not this #GOPTaxScam.
ICYMI: I spoke on the @HouseFloor in strong opposition to the #GOPTaxScam that is getting rammed through Congress today. https://t.co/95vLWVuG5M

Instead of enhancing the economic security of all Rhode Islanders, the #GOPTaxBill primarily benefits the wealthy and large corporations. https://t.co/D4oJRTqofe
Future generations will be burdened with an additional $1.7 trillion of debt in service of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations. The #GOPTaxScam is fiscally irresponsible! https://t.co/kMc8aq2U5r
