@drmagnificent @bryanedwardhill @juaneferreyra Just you wait.
@padaniels2 One of my favorite comics we've ever published. Ever.
I've got a few codes left for Killmonger #1. Hit me up and maybe I'll kick one your way.
I just finished Killmonger #5 by @bryanedwardhill &amp; @juaneferreyra, the final issue of the limited series. I'm still in the afterglow, but this is one of my favorite books we've ever put out. Masterful comics. If you love the Black Panther movie, you MUST read this. https://t.co/yWyyQOMVnQ
@Robert_Matthew YESSSSS!!! 100%. Lost gem of the late 90s.
@Jehutysan @jacketballtrain DOPE

@FabianNicieza @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua I get all the stuff! But I read every book we put out each week and more. NYC living means it's in storage somewhere. I'll get to it when we do our big Gambit retrospective!

@FabianNicieza @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua Faaaabian! I actually never read that run, since it was out during my poor college boy days! *ducks as Fabian throws anvil at me*
@durellreid98 @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua cool!
@maurice_peyton @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua Oh you're missing out! First issue are two are up on Marvel Unlimited if you're a subscriber. Great series!
@JackiEv87585672 @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua I read them years ago, but I'll give 'em another toss!
@durellreid98 @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua haha yes
@JoshCrewsReally I did! I enjoyed that book too, for sure.
@JoshCrewsReally I dig it! And I'm more in the minority, I think. But he's definitely growing on me.
@79SemiFinalist @obazaldua ACCEPTABLE GOAL
@MountVariable I found his charm to be more menacingly lascivious than others over the years.
@JoshCrewsReally I've always thought he was a grossy nasty dude.
@maurice_peyton @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua I mean, he can grow one pretty easily, no? And it's just a scene in the book.
@AwYeahComicsNY @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua If it's for charity, I do it easy, mon ami!
@pastellarts @79SemiFinalist @obazaldua He's always felt icky to me. But he's great in this book!
It's stuff like this that @79SemiFinalist is doing with Gambit that keeps chipping away at my dislike for the Cajun. Helps that this book is wonderful and gorgeous. From Mr &amp; Mrs X #8 by Kelly, @obazaldua, Frank D'Armata &amp; crew. On sale Feb 13. #MarvelsPullList https://t.co/eY4YL0JrDX

@pillsandadvice Smart
My moustache froze on the walk home.
@Rua_Lar @Marvel @CBCebulski Namor would KRUSH it in MK!
@RogerClark41 @NY1 Good to hear! Got worried we hadn't seen you on TV lately. Glad you're doing well!
@lindsiroot tag that #thisweekinmarvel because it's goooood for the pod
@StatGuyGreg @badcoverversion yeah, dude. it was messed up
@daltonator that's a cool shot!
@neumaverick i knowwww
@daltonator it's wild!
@neumaverick where i'm at in the city, it wouldn't do it justice
also, last night, @badcoverversion &amp; i got sucked into watching the day after tomorrow twice in a row by whatever tv channel was playing it back to back--which really felt like they were trolling
just turned around and looked out the window and with the wind whipping, it's snowing up. and sideways. cool.
@lawrencebrenner Blame Laufey. Or Ymir.
@WannabeGamer328 I've been kicking that around for our 60s #TWIMURC in March! Have to talk with @CBCebulski and see if he wants to do big first issues or a specific 60s story. SO MANY OPTIONS!
@PerciaVerlin @DanEv1985 oh no PPP is far worse
@JediTimeSaiyan @CoyJandreau @skydart I've been using an external drive for a long time...?

@skinkybob @JustinMcElroy @travismcelroy @griffinmcelroy @DocCurm That's the plan!
@whitniverse 1950s slang for a girlfriend? NO IDEA
We just had @OfficialTAZ on #ThisWeekinMarvel. We have @JohnnyGargano &amp; @CandiceLeRae on a future episode. But we've been mixing Marvel and pro wrestling all the way back! Here's a cover from a comic we put out in 1950! https://t.co/kIFfPf9w0K

YESSSSSSS https://t.co/jrRHGrBVnS

I'm reading Uncanny X-Men #11, which is on sale next week, and there's a story in the issue by @AshcanPress, @mccreaman, &amp; @spicercolor that has one of my favorite Wolverine panels/lines, maybe ever. Just the best. Not posting/spoiling it, but man! SO GOOD. https://t.co/6LGF893RKz

@theseantcollins @JohnnyGargano @KingRicochet @AdamRichesArt I was biting my hand by the end. Mesmerized and blown away.
YEAH OKAY SO @KingRicochet DRESSES LIKE SPIDER-MAN AND MOVES LIKE SPIDER-MAN AND...oh crap, i have to call J Jonah Jameson! (I somehow missed the jacket! AMAZING! SPECTACULAR! WEB OF!) https://t.co/2gGcTA5Up8
Not only did @JohnnyGargano &amp; @KingRicochet put on one of my favorite matches I've ever watched last night at #NXTTakeOver, Johnny Wrestling rocked some amazing Dark Phoenix-inspired ring gear! Great job, @AdamRichesArt! https://t.co/77alA6ycsp

@nhlrox yeah, some really great grain bread with seeds and deliciousness! Actually best as toast with butter and jam
@Netzer_r in good company
@pillsandadvice SAME.
@LivinIsntEasy86 there were tomato components in the thousand island dressing so that counts as a fruit. done!

@cdkellerson Happy to help! It works to keep your different meats apart and unique AND as you mention, get that cheese flavor
@PaulTobin not even the Mad Titan can keep me from my sammich

I'm really proud of my sandwich-making prowess this week. Yesterday and today came out great! https://t.co/w9SFUnfGBi
Three cheers to @saladinahmed, @javiercaster, @BakadoriSan, Muntsa Vicente &amp; crew on next week's Exiles #12. This has been one of my favorite comics for the last year and it's an INCREDIBLE finale. Gorgeous and thrilling and wonderful comics. I'll miss this masterful book. https://t.co/aoZHxYCeNt
@genghisgalahad2 @Marvel @tuckermarkus same timelines! the thing with comics is that one must have suspension of disbelief about when and where things happen. 6 issues of one series could happen in a span of a day while 6 issues of another, at the same time, could span months.
@jeffreylwilson Same!
@ZacBeThompson IT IS THE BESSSSST
@WannabeGamer328 @tuckermarkus I approve!

@frickhwa YESSS! One of my favorite stories as a kid.
Hey, y'all! Me and @Marvel EIC @CBCebulski are discussing the original 1939 Marvel Comics #1 for #ThisWeekinMarvel. Got thoughts/questions about the issue? Tweet &amp; tag #TWIMURC! Read the comic here: https://t.co/bsQO0Hdwgx #Marvel80
@Whatleydude That was my standard suit until the cyborg!
@el_gray I KNOWWWWW!!!!
@VaderManion I'm certainly biased, but of course. It's the second ever game I've platinum'd. My GOTY last year.

@uberhulk84 @KingKongBway Do it!
I'm at a VERY packed supermarket, hours before a potential storm, and it's making me very anxious and unsettled. But I just saw a little kid playing with a Miles Morales Spider-Man toy and I brought me a moment of solace.
@stevenspohn @corybarlog @GameOverGreggy @Marvel Invite goes out to you as well, Steven! Love the work you do.
@codyallenhager @ahfrancis It's like you're speaking kree to me! 😂

Earlier this year I got to interview Alfre Woodard and I told her how the movie is special to me, and thanked her for it. She was wonderful and we talked a bit about stuff and got a little teary. Meant a lot. https://t.co/xvoJHPLEdO
Watching Scrooged this year, I noticed that I'm right now the same age Frank Cross was in the movie. And about the same age as Bill Murray was while filming it. Just an interesting observation for me. https://t.co/0WBrDft7CS
My annual Christmas Eve tradition is to watch Scrooged. I usually feel blue during the holidays and it always helps. https://t.co/YEsZ0HOkxY

Stan Lee and me and @lorrainecink. New York Comic Con 2012 https://t.co/ctLyvMDaCi
@lorrainecink https://t.co/V9NDm07WRL
This popped back up today. "Wherever Marvel goes...whenever Marvel goes...I'll be there." - Stan Lee https://t.co/2EjNy88DDc
@ACharisPollard yessss! HUZZAH!
Raised some glasses to Stan the Man Lee with the Marvel NYC family this evening.
I was looking on our youtube for video of an interview @lorrainecink &amp; I did with Stan Lee at Comic-Con, but found this of Stan &amp; I celebrating Marvel's 75th anniversary: https://t.co/Um7ukkS2Sq
@nick_lowe_ @ElliePyle Oh: https://t.co/kASuCnpDWq
@BillRosemann Oooh: https://t.co/coLorMTxEB
Stan Lee, total boss. Comic-Con 2013. https://t.co/TlCOIz2LBD
Comic-Con 2012. Stan Lee and his Hall of Iron Man Armors. And him talking to a young fan. https://t.co/NM0W4ncnQ4
Me interviewing Stan Lee at Marvel HQ in NYC, February 2014. Afterwards, cameras off, he said, "Boy you're good. That was a great interview." I'm sure he did this with everyone, but it's one of those moments I'll never forget. https://t.co/GPLPRpJ0q9
Some pics of Stan Lee visiting Marvel HQ in NYC, February 2014. https://t.co/BjVbuwrmac
@JoeTabs 💜 https://t.co/mTMUcwhu1i
@BillRosemann found this great pics of you and Stan Lee from 2014. https://t.co/f5A4jgOrkO
Two of my favorite photos i took of Stan Lee, on Odin's throne in the Marvel booth at Comic-Con 2010. https://t.co/eKCcw8g074
Here's a terrible photo of me making Stan Lee laugh during an interview at a video game party during Comic-Con 2010. https://t.co/JjPZWACnKW
We used to do a fun thing with the Palm Restaurant in San Diego, where our artists would draw Marvel characters on their walls. It was glorious. The spot is gone, but here's Stan Lee, his portrait between Romita Spideys, taken in 2012. https://t.co/DiK5te0MoZ
The first time I met Stan Lee was Comic-Con 2008. He was in the back of the Marvel booth, holding court, relaxing. I asked for a photo and he was super sweet, asked me what I did, made me feel like a star. https://t.co/7mLl3rU4tA

@purenoiserecs @DrugChurch @DerekLandy @philipsytan 👍👍👍
@BenHBailey @SOIANYC Yeah! Saw them first in 95 or 96? I remember they played the last show at my favorite spot on Long Island. December 96. The PWAC. SO GOOD.
@BenHBailey @SOIANYC https://t.co/shK5Euu4Bd
@Erik_Nowak @CharlesSoule @philnoto @SOIANYC HELL. YES.
@BenHBailey @SOIANYC There were! I googled Step Down Sick of It All gif and there were a few. Would have made some if there weren't!
And now I just finished next week's #Daredevil issue (#611) by @CharlesSoule, @philnoto &amp; team while listening to the new @SOIANYC album. Maybe my favorite arc of an absolutely terrific DD run. And, SOIA? Just the best, forever and ever. https://t.co/R1T7OWmzRD

@ACharisPollard YES read Immortal Hulk on MU. That's great. ALSO READ EXILES I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT. And yes, that's with Peggy Cap.
@ACharisPollard Have you read Exiles yet?
@ACharisPollard We already recorded this week's, but this is great for next week's episode! Also, out this week - Marvel Knights 20th is a neat start, Immortal Hulk is RAD. Next week, Captain Marvel prelude has new MCU content. Uncanny X-Men! Exiles!
YOOOOOO LOOK AT T HIS AMAZING PIECE OF ANT-MAN &amp; THE WASP ART BY @HeGotGronch!! Our social team had this made and I LOVE IT SO MUCH. https://t.co/MPbk49UZ95
Inadvertently found ourselves at a geek trivia night at our local pub. We would have crushed it had we played. Saw a dude wearing an Xavier School tee. Told him Uncanny X-Men #1 comes out next week and it's great, which is just like voting, so I win again today. https://t.co/NYKd9ZyaTI

@ChildOfTyche @Marvel No, I know. It was in a different draft I wrote, but forgot to pass along to the editors. Having them put it back in because it is key.
@ChildOfTyche @Marvel I did have her flipping on Norman in one of my drafts--that should be in there. And I had a larger overall note that she's done tons of good and this skips a lot for brevity's sake.
I wrote some things about Emma Frost, who is awesome and re-reading lots of her stories has only made me love her more. https://t.co/yn44tDZBYw

@nilaffle Really dug your Spider-Byte story in Vault of Spiders! Way fun!
This is easily one my favorite comics story this year. It's a gorgeous, wild, amazing Japanese Spider-Man story that fully captures the weird and fun spirit of the original 70s Supaidaman tokusatsu series. GET IT WEDNESDAY IN VAULT OF SPIDERS OR ELSE. Yeah Yeah Yeah WOW! https://t.co/PUoG48JxBn

Our local USPS office almost lost Lola's ashes. @badcoverversion had to deal with them...they misplaced them, but eventually found them. Lola is now home. I'm a mess but such is life.
@wred42 Please reach out to @MarvelSupport
Rough morning because Lola's ashes are coming home today. At the vet now with Lucy who needs blood work. But the lady who gave me her parking space also gave me the receipt for parking for 2 hours. Remember that a small kindness can mean so much to someone. https://t.co/LsKk8e77IU

@tammyturtle55 @Daredevil get up early and watch before work! clear mind!
@JasonBall34 Sure, there's some jokes and funny moments.
@EnglandAidan they're all made to be enjoyed without having to see the others. you'll be good. I dug LC2 and IF2 has some really neat stuff, especially through to the end. but you can watch those after DD3 and still enjoy 'em all.
@michalnajdr1 i wouldn't call it depressing. it's great. it's intense
@JasonBall34 It's like a great Marvel story--highs and lows, lots of big character stuff, lots of action, lots of intensity. it's very intense, and I loved it. I hope you will as well.
@SeanIzaakse @Daredevil HURRY, SEAN
@daltonator @Daredevil prepare yourself!

This next issue of #CaptainAmerica, which comes out in a few days, has one of my favorite splash page/caption combinations this year. Just a fantastic mix of story/words/art by Ta-Nehisi, @leinilyu, &amp; co. Reminds me how much I love comics.
@PoppaDietsch @BenJMorse Oh maaaaaaan!
@hEnereyG @ALL_IN_2018 Jealous!

@cracksh0t I love that it started as a gag for a pin-up, but someone was probably like, "but actually..."
@katiecandraw I would love that!
Not too late to celebrate #InternationalCatDay with the little kitty crew that @badcoverversion &amp; I share our lives with. Lola, battling cancer. Lucy, looking regal. Maybellene, with her snes classic. Janie Jones &amp; Brian Eno, Cuddle Force. https://t.co/oDpFrUKhNG

I'm just listening to Entombed for the rest of the morning, which both makes me happy and makes me want smash things even more. #wolverineblues #lefthandpath #imthehollowman https://t.co/J9R9GmsNtL

well, it's closing time here on earth https://t.co/z8BWSCIFMg
Mild respite from general anger and sadness at the world this morning when I saw 3 bunnies on my run AND a dude who looked like a smaller, less swole Vin Diesel--complete with white tee and neck chain.

And the fact that #KingKongBway has @f_francavilla, @ollymoss, and Laurent Durieux involved--and front &amp; center--makes me even more excited for this! https://t.co/L7y5N3rWrH
I was walking to lunch with @JohnCerilli, and we spotted the space where #KingKongBway will be, and it's just a few blocks from Marvel HQ! Looks so rad! https://t.co/VnlXlwEo6V

@jmaldo25 @JohnnyGargano @ProjectCiampa Neat!
@chompzy All that said, when I was a kid (6, 7, 8) I read LOTS of comics that were meant for kids older than me, and just jumped in at random issues. It worked out for me!
@chompzy The Marvel Age and Marvel Adventures books are solid for kids, all around. https://t.co/fGPFPo84Sa Power Pack is good, about 4 young sibling super heroes: https://t.co/2VYGaX438o These Franklin Richards comics are terrific: https://t.co/F3U7MhQri8
@chompzy Thanks for the reminder! We don't have a TON of young readers' stuff with Black Panther. The Marvel Super Heroes Adventures is great, though! This one has BP: https://t.co/GOoi7DKlqb This Marvel Age book has BP &amp; FF: https://t.co/4Ia2W8xM6N
@axetogrindcast I'm with Tom. This Hirs Collective record is dope.

@EastVillChris Three is too much? They're all vastly different. And I love all of them!

@andybates Whaaaaat?! @BrandonGrugle or @ronxo--any ideas?
Stuck in traffic on the FDR, trying to get home. My cab driver is cleaning his ears with q-tips. There is no punchline.
I dunno why "awards" autocorrected to "baling," but whatever. I've been up since 2:30 am. 🛫
6:15am flight back to NYC! See ya, #E32018! It was a blast. Last pic: the best of show baling that #SpiderManPS4 had, halfway through #e3. More to come, I'm sure! 👍👍 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/kxBb1klH2g
@LitheraPrime @bryanintihar Maybe a single shirt? I want one as well!
@MarkCSaun Right? So smooth
@IrishJaguar You're welcome!
Yay #SpiderManPS4! That's a wrap from the #E3Coliseum! #AgentMLovesE3
Nice shoutout from the panelists to @EvanFilarca and the #SpideySquad. #SpiderManPS4 #E3 #AgentMLovesE3
The different Spidey suits in #SpiderManPS4 will each have different and unique powers. #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3
NYC in #SpiderManPS4 is constantly reflecting what's going on in the story. People's reactions to him will be different at different points. #E30218 #AgentMLovesE3
NYC in #SpiderManPS4--you can find Avengers Tower, Wakandan Embassy, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and more cool Marvel spots. #E30218 #AgentMLovesE3
Watching live gameplay of #SpiderManPS4, and some neat stealth action into a bigger brawl. #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/tWowWPjIia
The Vulture design was one of the first #SpiderManPS4 villains the team came with. #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/YiNUlCf2ln
Neat Electro concept art. @BillRosemann discussed the lightning bolt scars on his face in the #SpiderManPS4 design. #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/LffPuLw9UY
The statue in the Collector's Edition of #SpiderManPS4, according to @BillRosemann, has some spoilers for the story, but it keeps the secret. Don't open it all the way until you play it deep! #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3
Confirmed by @bryanintihar: the Raft #SpiderManPS4 #E32018 video takes place in the second half of the game. #AgentMLovesE3
Panel giving big props for the #SpiderManPS4 art team on the rain, wet effects, pops in colors, details, contrasts, etc in the Raft video. #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3
Bill discussing how the Raft in #SpiderManPS4 has been seen in comics and films, but this--like Spidey's costume and the villain designs--are very much a version designed for the game. #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3
On the #SpiderManPS4 panel: @bryanintihar, @jon_paquette, @jacinda_chew, &amp; Ryan Smith from @insomniacgames, and @BillRosemann from @MarvelGames. They're giving a little creator commentary for the Raft #E32018 video. #AgentMLovesE3

@AlexaRayC I'LL BE AT THE PARTY YES HUGZ  DID YOU SURVIVE THE KH STUFF JUST NOW?
I dunno anything about Kingdom Hearts but a bunch of people looked like Sephiroths. And so many of my friends are freaking out about it. So, cool! #E32018 #PlayStationE3 #AgentMLovesE3
Control looks dope! #E32018 #PlayStationE3 #AgentMLovesE3
@nclaycamp Yeah hoping for one as well
@SuperRob Stream on twitch is perfect
Yo somebody give the Foley artists for Ghost of Tsushima all the raises. It looks INCREDIBLE, but that sound work is something special. #PlayStationE3 #E32018 #AgentMLovesE3
@NotSoRandomHero Probably cheaper to just buy them when they're out? 😎

Cool guy, party of 1! #BE3 #Fallout76 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/bLcKTmD5Vy

@Mister_Walsh Truly! That's gonna be tremendous!
Standing in line for a Fallout penny (I'm not sure yet either) and I engaged in the most manly of triple hugs with @nickchester &amp; @ScottPorter. #e3 is friendship, you guys.

@pillsandadvice Perfect
@TheBush84 The presentation sold me and I'm not an online guy
@DavidEllis Are you doing Rage now?! Or just waving because we need to hang? (We do)
@nickchester @ronxo I'm in line for a fallout...something?
@Ael_Xander So much!
Holy crap. Bethesda ain't playing around! Starfield, Elder Scrolls V I, Blades, all the Fallout 76 details...👏👏👏👏👏👏 #BE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I think the 2 games I've put the most time into, and enjoyed most, are Witcher 3 and Fallout 4. I'm disgustingly excited for Fallout 76! #BE3 #AgentMLovesE3
All this Prey stuff looks neat! It's on my stack to play soon. I've been playing Dishonored: Death of the Outsider lately and I love it so much. #BE3 #AgentMLovesE3
Quake Champions gives me flashbacks to Quake 3 Arena on that dial-up! #BE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I'm now 100% all in on Rage 2. Dang! #BE3 #AgentMLovesE3
God, I love @AndrewWK so much. The music, the person, he's the best. Great way to kick off #BE3! #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/wzQ2Qccyp4

@Wheels1993 @BandaiNamcoUS Less vertical from what I played
@TimDillon @BandaiNamcoUS Not sure. Environment was large, blew up some stuff, moved fast
@BangPopcorn Very cute! Made up language! Want more Link Fox!
@chompzy I'm at an event and want to answer properly when I have time! Please tweet me again in the morning!
@KGullic Thank you! And pet Sophie for me!
My view for the #BE3 showcase. I'm fairly certain this is the same spot @ronxo, @nickchester, some other friends, &amp; I went to a party (for a car game?) where we hung out with (i.e. stood near) Rampage Jackson. #e3, nah mean? https://t.co/WmnRcCX1A3
Of the 5 #E3 wristbands I'm currently wearing, Bethesda's is the only one blinking, and thus the best. #BE3 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/BAd9tUfFSU
Time for #BE3! Fun times! #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/DStFFyMsFb

Ori cookie! {character is probably not Ori? Still gonna munch its head.) #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/3fNfV8Culo
Got to try Ashen and Tunic and and Black Desert. Fun stuff, especially Tunic. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I put some time in with Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Cool platformer, very pretty! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I heard about Kingdom: Two Crowns on a recent @WhatsGood_Games episode. Played a bit, and it's really cool. I could lose hours with that game. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/4NXJ5GZKgZ
Confirmed: Jump Force is rad! I played a match with Goku &amp; Luffy &amp; Zoro vs Frieza and some other animes I don't know. Destructive 3d fighter. Neat! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/Xp2Nl02yYC
Now boppin' around the #XboxE3 showcase and hopefully play some games. This is probably the ideal way to play Forza Horizon 4? https://t.co/2W6Ae1gKWP
@pillsandadvice @CDPROJEKTRED Right?! So much fun!
AAAAAHHHHHH #CYBERPUNK2077! Now that's what I was hoping for! That trailer made my toes curl. Into anything @CDPROJEKTRED does! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3

New Battletoads and 2 new Gears games! Solid ending to the #XboxE3 briefing! #AgentMLovesE3
@GameOverGreggy @KindaFunnyKevin @MaximumCortez Yes let's!
@pillsandadvice The nuest metal
Yooooooo JUMP FORCE! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
Tunic looks like Monument Valley x old school Legend of Zelda with a cute fox protagonist. Delightful! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
@mcrookedlettery Copy that!
Devil May Cry 5! I think I saw a giant monster with a mouth in its abdomen that ate a car and spit out fire. INTO IT! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I gotta get into these Tomb Raider games. Shadow looks dope. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
The Division 2 looks really neat. I haven't played the first, though. Between what we're seeing and @GameOverGreggy's positive hype, I'll have to check it out. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
@PoppaDietsch 💪💪💪
Ooh Microsoft bought Ninja Theory. I have Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice loaded up on my ps4 to play soon. Nice! #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
This Forza game looks nuts. Everyone playing all together at once. But my racing game tastes are Burnout or Road Rash. Ooh confetti in the #XboxE3 room! #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/C7ZQJs4hsh
@CharlesSoule All around west Virginia. Looks amazing
Oh Crackdown 3, you look so fun. Please don't break my heart. I love the original. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
Fallout 76 will be 4 times the size of Fallout 4?! Yaaaaassss #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/7w3lzTi1cw
Sekiro looks neat! A little bit of a Tenchu vibe in parts. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I don't know anything about these Ori games, but Will of the Wisps looks super cute. But all I can think of is our character, Will-O'-The-Wisp. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/pD8vWahnhM
I bought my og Xbox on day one and played Halo CE, Halo 2, etc religiously for years. Color me immediately hyped for Halo Infinite. #XboxE3 #AgentMLovesE3
I've already seen @GreatWallofChin &amp; @jeffrubenstein at #XboxE3, so I consider this day a success. #AgentMLovesE3
In the cheap seats for #XboxE3 briefing, but boy howdy do I prefer the event here in LA Live, and not at the Galen Center. So much easier this year! #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/mo4ETGh4w2
@mcrookedlettery The new game from CD projekt red
Oooh #XboxE3 mystery merch! https://t.co/upejJ7TA6v
My hotel room isn't ready, but thankfully I've got a pass for #XboxE3! And don't get it twisted: I go to multiple #e3 showcases every year because I love video games and enjoy the hooplah. Doesn't mean anything more than #AgentMLovesE3. https://t.co/EwpKDWYa05
@Sayasha Right on!
@DaveMacAddict Heck yeah!
@daltonator Quite!
Thankfully the sick gentleman seems to be stable. Lying on the floor by the cockpit, with oxygen, right near me. No one panicked. People went into helping mode. I think some other docs popped up. Quiet and stable now.
In all my hundreds of flights, this is the first time I've heard staff ask for a doctor for a sick passenger. Doc came quick. She was ready to help in seconds. Lots of activity.

Best way to start my trip to LA for #E3 is with that tasty first class upgrade! And particularly with that One Direction spot! Got my comics and Switch and I'm ready to go! #AgentMLovesE3 https://t.co/Pxy9koIzfL

@cokennon @badcoverversion @ChuckWendig 100% loved it! I was skeptical but it works!
Experiencing the #Wendigo (bacon, peanut butter, mayo, pickles on toast) and it's delightful! @badcoverversion whipped it up based on @ChuckWendig's mad food thoughts. Would eat again. https://t.co/p6P2u9EpAr

@natalieekoch @missmayim @chrisrobinson Crushed it
By the end of the event, all the kids left with books, photos with a Super Hero, swag bags with more books &amp; an Infinity Gauntlet, and smiles aplenty. Today was really special, and a great reminder of how much our stories and characters can mean to kids. Thanks, @LtlFreeLibrary! https://t.co/t1qjBxNXzY
I met and talked with many of the @NewtonLAPD officers and folks working at the community center. Like officer Hernandez, a terrific woman doing so much work with the kids, the families, and people in her community. Great crew, @LAPDRIMKUNAS! https://t.co/tA9vH2N9mK
Oh yeah, Captain America came to the event as well. Watching the kids' faces when Cap walked into the room? Amazing! https://t.co/vHtOQ92BI5
The LAPD was at the event, and in large part thanks to Semmi, their connection with the community is strong and great to witness. https://t.co/BE5oWd7DtP
And the library is dedicated to a boy named Semmi Veasey, who battled brain cancer, and deeply impacted the community in so many ways that even  I was able to see in my few short hours there. Here's me with Semmi's mom, who's just the best. https://t.co/dz6B3t5vrm
I was joined by @BrandonTSnider, writer of Avengers Cosmic Quest, to reveal this amazing free library of books to kids. https://t.co/xVrWdOdtfr
I've been able to do really cool things in my time with @Marvel. Today, I got to be part of an event with Marvel, Disney Publishing, &amp; @LtlFreeLibrary, to bring Marvel books to kids. It was incredible. https://t.co/Xyu2U8slLh
