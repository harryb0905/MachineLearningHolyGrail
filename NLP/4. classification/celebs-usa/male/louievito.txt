See you New Years Day Pasadena.
I love waking up to snow. I am so hyped to go riding tomorrow.
Hot take before I go to bed.   Ohio State gets in at 4.
Christmas time I’m there. I have a charity event there on the 28th. Come cruise. U don’t gotta compete if u don’t want. https://t.co/MNqoUDw5Lr
Mad River mannnnnnnnnn. Hahahaha. https://t.co/aK4gmj1B24
Well Kyler had 37 passing touchdowns going into tonight so like I said, I didn’t include rushing touchdowns. And I’ll make it a bit simpler for you, I said I don’t think Dwayne will win. I think Tua wins. Contrary to your wishes, I already said Dwayne is most likely in 3rd. https://t.co/XmtaOupNEm
Merry Christmas!!!! Very much appreciated!!!!! https://t.co/IRa88USe6A
Update: I am still testing different ways to get my shin to touch without my knee (on flat ground). So far, I have been unable to. Maybe my toe point isn’t good enough
I guess it did tonight at the game. https://t.co/nP3H4Dll0m
Your numbers are off but I’m also going passing numbers. I said kyler is by far a better runner. But if we want to be going that route, let’s consider the first half of the year when Dwayne didn’t even play 4 quarters🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/oNr4NBqQgx
He popped up like nothing after being out hahaha https://t.co/AZtFa10Gdm
Listen. I’m not mad if either wins. I think statistically Dwayne should. But i think he is in 3rd. https://t.co/xAPyxUkyUp
Correction. Northwestern actually has a better defense than Texas. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/NNFEQDnAsY
Hahaha yea they lost. We get it. Still ranked about 40 spots better than Oklahoma even WITH GETTING BLOWN OUT. So what does that say about Oklahoma’s defense https://t.co/7SRAbaT0gr
I give u the Purdue loss. Why I said that from the jump. But look what he did tonight against the number 1 ranked defense last week and northwestern is about the same defensively as Texas and he put up better numbers tonight. https://t.co/NNFEQDnAsY
IO https://t.co/AFH4symfJD
We talking last year or this year? 🤔. So to you, Cam Newton is better than Brees cuz Newton has more rushing yards https://t.co/YVFuEXzmCu
Less passing yards than Dwayne. Less passing touchdowns than Dwayne. And before tonight I think Dwayne was 1% passing percent behind kyler. Also kyler lost to Texas. Dwayne put up numbers against at the time the #1 defense in the country. https://t.co/ULFBvTqTTv
I just hate to see that some have already voted before tonight. https://t.co/MeqRymZSsj
Ehhh kyler is already getting loot. And baseball is that guaranteed money. I hope they both do. https://t.co/giPeCbRr1p
Hahaha I’m agreeing with you. I’m saying he is gonna lead almost if not all caragories except rushing which to me isn’t a big deal. We on the same page https://t.co/xY1iC0c1Qw
Hahaha and you are a quarterback. Tom Brady is a pretty good quarterback I would say. https://t.co/qPYnQM8Gvu
I’m not saying he thinks he shouldn’t win. I’m saying based on numbers, Dwayne leads out of the 3. I even said he prolly won’t win, but he should based on numbers https://t.co/wRhsKzuMvj
Also, I would love to see the defensive stats of the teams in the big 12 they played. I’ll wait. https://t.co/RUKbv9wjgs
Bring facts please. https://t.co/RUKbv9wjgs
Besides team record, @dh_simba7 should win the Heisman. Numbers don’t lie. And don’t come at me with rushing yards.
Well.............
I’m over here trying to get my shin to touch the ground without my knee touching. 🤔🤔
FINALLY!!!!! Let’s go BUCKS!!!
That’s amazing. I give u credit for that https://t.co/jdilFOFPjz
And to think people have already casted their Heisman ballot.
If they win big today they beat the 2 best wins Notre Dame has in back to back weeks. https://t.co/1842yMEw3Q
Sorry but that is assuming Bama wins. Then what I said before.
If Ohio State wins big, Oklahoma is at 3 and Ohio State at 4. That’s what should happen. Don’t @ me.
I love what you do day in and day out. https://t.co/yhgbqmhh74

Sorry @MTVBananas. I know you held on to the W last year for so long. #GoBucks #NotARivalry
Been saying it the last 2 weeks. Wasn’t worried about Barkley (I think he is a stud) but it came down to JT. And he played! And the defense!

@pjskelly @FloydMayweather Naw. Can't say that. He TKO'd him. Doesn't matter what round. A win is a win and didn't have to go to the score card. Why change that?
@TimLMoody Hahaha. I'm just happy it was a decent fight compared to previous ones
@pjskelly @FloydMayweather True. But won by TKO so there was some offense wouldn't u say?
I wish they woulda let it go til someone went to sleep.

People will still talk mad garbage about Bron when his numbers don't lie.
@KWhitProduction Still can't deny his series he has had though.
Do the Warriors win if Durant wasn't on the team? Shoulda woulda coulda I know, just a thought because he is handling business
Durant earned this MVP. Doesn't matter who or what is in his face, he is clutch.

@BrianAmlani Aren't u a Lakers fan BA? Hahaha. Miss u too my dude
@Mike_Mason81 What he say this series after any of the games to bring it on
@BrianAmlani But you also obviously missed the point that tweet BA.
@BrianAmlani I would say Bron is more hated than Kobe.
Let me have this one tonight GSW fans. Please and thank you. #OH #OhioAgainstTheWorld
Durant puts up 35 and loses and everyone will defend him. Bron puts up 30 and loses and everyone has a field day...
@SalMasekela Oh at this point, I am enjoying it and will. After those first 3, I need at least 1 night hahaha
@richhomiechief You mean game 1, 2, and 3?
These refs will need some warm tea to soothe their sore throats. All I hear is whistle after whistle

@guskenworthy you get these responses every time you tweet? Ima make u let me borrow your phone at Dew for some reading material.
I don't disagree with everything you say and I don't agree with everything @guskenworthy but complaining about others complaining...
@guskenworthy @realDonaldTrump racist? Interesting. Well enjoy the next 4 yrs. Don't complain if others aren't allowed to cuz u disagree
@guskenworthy @realDonaldTrump I say the same thing about people still complaining about him
I have a feeling @CurtisSamuel4__ will go off next week. Just my too early prediction. #TheGAME
@GREENeCHRIS98 when u coming back?!
Man it was nuking in Michigan and West Virginia. We NEED that snow!
2:30PM. Recovery run done, Ohio State wins, cheat meal on the way and a full day left of College Football. #PrayingForSnow
I have them at 4. Assuming they win out. Won't be easy. And Oklahoma St. next week. https://t.co/4Hom6hkD7q
@dannykanell I don't see Penn State beating Wisconsin. The reason for 2. OSU/ Mich is winner of that game I have in.
@dannykanell I have 1. Bama 2. OSU/Mich 3. Clemson 4. Oklahoma back doors in. (Assuming everyone wins out)
They beat a top 4 Michigan who bumps them? Clemson? No. Washington? No. ESPECIALLY if Wisc and Oklahoma win conferences. (PSU for B1G East) https://t.co/IAlTq98gLZ
Learn from the mistakes and get hyped!!!!! Next week, TTUN!!! I can't express how stoked I am!!!! #GoBucks #TOSU #OH
Smart man https://t.co/rfNYBqA1qc
I don't see how @dannykanell can compare Washington's wins to Ohio State. Win and OSU is in.

Used @hotelstonight for the first time and booked a "hip" hotel. Got upgraded from a "disco double" to a "dancing queen."  Sounds hip to me
What up Sydney!!!!! NZ, I miss you already. @CardronaParksNZ I'll see you soon though.

3 starters return on offense, 3 starters return on defense. These new Bucks have really stepped up. They don't rebuild, they reload. #Facts
Ward laying the BOOOOOM!
At what point does Oklahoma put in @A_Kendall11 to "light up Ohio State's basic defense?"  Literally just wondering.
Man, Noah Brown...need I really have to finish that thought.
I know I snowboard and all but I don't think this is a touchdown. https://t.co/EZ6GOvOsEc

I may have to wake up at like 4am to catch some of the Ohio State game before I go riding. One way to get hyped for the day.
Okay. I must have pumped them up and come back the next play with another pick 6. I'll take credit haha
Houston's defense is coming on STRONG this second half. The build up to UH Louisville...

Watching this series has me thinking to my old days when I use to lower the hoop to about 6.5 feet and go ham!  I was so sick!
Oh I can imagine. I remember game days on our trips haha https://t.co/Kr5aRbJbUI
I love watching sports, but I also hate it when you have zero control. I find it frustrating.
@thisnicelife naw. You aren't even a golden state fan haha
@thisnicelife I was told I'm a late bloomer haha
Prolly why I stopped growing at 5'6'' hahaha https://t.co/Rl3VZDzMHu
@thisnicelife hahaha. He for sure voices his opinion but he does get smacked around just not as noticeable on a linebacker
@BENBALLER Hahahaha a non joking Lebron pic. I can help pick it up out game 7 is gonna be heavy!
But man @KlayThompson has been ballin.
Gosh I want that more than the city getting a ship haha https://t.co/tvpOcgl4eD
He use to give me a hard time growing up when I was going to school in Vermont 😂😂😂
And note to everyone. @thisnicelife and I go way back.
@thisnicelife Hahahaha. Complaining about getting hack a Shaq and throwing stuff is different to me. But again that's me.
@thisnicelife come on Andy. Haha been to long. You can say it haha
Even if the Cavs lose it's all good. This series has been a roller coaster. But mannnnn the city of Cleveland needs this haha
Stay in your lane. He never threw his mouthpiece. And that lil bitch leads every category for both teams. #hater  https://t.co/YJYbPqJNNy
This is a MAN's league Hahahaha. No throwing things haha

@RyanBasford wait. You don't abbreviate it as Weds?? Haha thought I spelt it out wrong which is realistic. But I always shorten it Weds
Fun fact: Lebron leads both teams in assists, rebounds, blocks, steals (tied w/ Kyrie) and 1 point behind Kyrie for points. Still down 3-2
Hahahahaha hahahahaha. Whoops  https://t.co/RAoJ4mYwTc
What day do you start planning your weekend??
