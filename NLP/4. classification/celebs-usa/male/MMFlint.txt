Tomorrow night, Tues Feb 26, I will be one of the subjects on the PBS show "Finding Your Roots" hosted by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Whatever I thought the story was of how my family came to America, that all got turned on its head! Watch: 8pm/ET&amp;PT, PBS. https://t.co/dEE4YCMRSO
I’m not for Amy Klobuchar because if the Democrats run a centrist or moderate, Trump will win. But when I heard how she mercilessly beats up on her staff AND eats salads with a comb, I thought, huh, maybe she COULD beat him. A crazed street fighter versus a crazed street fighter?
I watched “Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy”, new on Netflix. Wow. The director of Borat &amp; Religulous takes a world tour of comedy in Iraq, Somalia, Palestine &amp; elsewhere-plus a deep dive in the US. Comedy as resistance, rebellion &amp; refuge. Watch! https://t.co/L5tEm6KgXd
A must-read, whether you’re for Bernie or not. Nobody has to make up their mind a yr in advance. But the facts must be told. We need the one who will CRUSH Trump. “20 Reasons Bernie Sanders Is The One To Beat Trump In 2020 (*Backed By Data)” (from Medium) https://t.co/sNOzqcc8Ul
Too early to endorse, but very happy to see Bernie Sanders running again! Medicare for All, the $15/hr minimum wage, free college tuition — all ideas pushed by Bernie in 2016 (they called him crazy 4 this) and now all polls show the MAJORITY of Americans take the same position!
Over 50,000 protested Trump’s fake national emergency today in dozens of cities around the US. Thank you MoveOn, ACLU, Indivisible, SEIU and the teachers unions for standing up for the rest of us. https://t.co/kO445kuN0v

My enormous thanks to the Writers Guild of America for nominating “Fahrenheit 11/9” as the Best Documentary of the Year. I’m honored that this new film is being recognized by my fellow writers. The film warned of the current “National Emergency” &amp; what Trump will do next with it. https://t.co/JeQSE8iJEj

Parkland, Florida. March 15, 2018. They were planning the “March for Our Lives” at a “secret location” due to fears of, well, living in America. A week later they would ignite an historic moment in American history. We are still in that moment. How this ends is up to us. https://t.co/X4ryZAJE2x
We are a violent people. We cherish violence as much as we claim to cherish Apple Pie. I honor the Parkland dead every day and I thank and honor the living Parkland students who have ignited a mass citizens movement. Each of us have to do our part, or this madness will never end.
Halting all efforts to save the planet from climate change is an act of violence. Mass incarceration is an act of violence. And, right now, this hr, the Senate would not pass the bill to keep the government open UNLESS THE “VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT” WAS ELIMINATED! And it was.
We are a violent people. We solve our problems through violence. We are always at war somewhere. As one of the last nations on earth that has the death penalty, we seek revenge through state-sanctioned murder. Forcing 40 million people to live in poverty is an act of violence.
These are 17 beloved people who live on, 1 year later, in all of our lives, inspiring us to act, to fight, to never give up until this uniquely American epidemic is obliterated. Today alone, nearly 100 ppl in the US will die from gun violence. That’s 5 Parklands every day here. https://t.co/5GCxfdftlQ

There is already a massive amount of evidence - much of which has come from Trump himself - to file Articles of Impeachment. The 30 daily lies, the money laundering, the ethical violations, the refusal to receive a daily security briefing, not working 60% of the time — IMPEACH!
Dems must quit saying they’re waiting 4 the “Mueller Report” like Moses is making a delivery. There may not be a “report.” He may not have Trump’s fingerprints on actual crimes. If Mueller can’t deliver on Trump, Dems’ll be backed into a corner cause Trump will’ve been “cleared.”

Trump this morning is claiming to be a victim of “Presidential harassment.”  Is this his first salvo to starting his own Me Too movement — “Trump Too!”? Next up: Presidents Lives Matter. I’m guessing any talk of impeachment must now be accompanied with a trigger warning for him.
A happy 70th birthday to the great Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan! When I was starting out, Jim was a huge inspiration and good friend. My favorite film of his is “In America.” Looking forward to his next project!
The vast majority of Americans support raising taxes on the rich and the uber-rich... Fox News Poll: 70% of Americans say TAX THE RICH! Hill-Harris Poll: 59% say TAX THE RICH! Politico Poll: 76% say TAX THE RICH! Trump and his cronies know what's coming.
A great victory for the majority of Americans when a scared Trump declared: "America will never be a socialist country!” Ha! The last gasp of The Greed Class!

The Women in White —  what must Trump have thought when he saw this unstoppable sight? He saw his future. His near future. They are coming for him. The White Walkers.

If you aren’t tired of me speaking just one more time this week from my uncensored, unfiltered mind, I’ll be on Lawrence O’Donnell at 10:30pm ET/PT tonight on MSNBC. The tsunami of justice and change cannot be stopped.  We are in a great, important moment.

Trump TRUMPED! Choked on Nancy’s leash. But don’t think he’s going away. He will use these 3 weeks to plot the most deceptive and treasonous fake “national emergency” in the history of this country. Trump will try to declare his version of martial law in order to get his Wall. https://t.co/4YyGKlLTpU

The Women’s March at my theater in Michigan today. We had an historic victory in Nov. But let’s not forget—last year, Congress was 20% women. Today, the newly-elected Congress is now... 24%.

What would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like? Sit-ins. Takeover buildings. Shut down all air travel. A human “wall” at the WhiteHouse. Hound Mitch McConnell so that he has no sleep, no lunches w/ lobbyists. Refuse to show up for work. I’d join that!
Democrats Are Afraid Of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Too. And That’s A Good Thing. https://t.co/I4KYggCziH

Trump today called James Comey “A BAD COP &amp; A DIRTY COP.” I hope when Comey heard that from the man he helped elect President by TWICE confusing the public with false info about Hillary C just before the election—I hope Comey is thinking long &amp; hard about the madness he created.
“I never worked for Russia.” Now on the run, hunted daily by the press, by Mueller, now by the new House— scared, defensive, constantly repeating like a madman, “THERE WAS NO COLLUSION!”— and today forced to answer the kind of question never asked before of an American President.

The NFL ownership is racist 2 its core. It’s an odd business model considering its black people who make them rich. Their fear of Kaepernick has this wk led 2 them hiring only white coaches. “Keep it white if we are to maintain control!” This guy nails it: https://t.co/KR7nHK4ube

“Beheadings,” “rape,” “hammer to the head” — just the basic nutterTrump tonight. 9 &amp; 1/2 min of nothing. His face wrenched in hate &amp; bigotry, but mostly stupidity. He didn’t even know how to pander correctly to his base. After it was over, Pelosi &amp; Schumer put the 4yr old to bed.
Trump, live now, railing against immigrants while sitting beside the photo of his immigrant mother. Shame. https://t.co/Oly64Zy2bF
Trump’s threat of placing the country in a state of “national emergency”—when there isn’t one—IS a national emergency. Because an autocratic hater of true democracy, who’s reveling in the fact he’s shut the gov’t down, is letting u know HE’s the actual threat to all we hold dear.
“Fahrenheit 11/9” — now in its 4th week at #1 on iTunes documentaries! Thanks to all who’ve watched &amp; said how this film blew u away. I promised u a story no one has told u &amp; no one else will. Watch tonite— it’ll be the best antidote after Trump’s TV show! https://t.co/1BaLIDkhc9
Trump’s shitshow he’ll be performing tonight is all part of the plan. He’s an autocrat who’s been itching for a “national emergency.” He hopes to prep the country for it tonight. This is how a coup begins. Seize powers u don’t have to save your own skin. Friends, be ready to act!
Trump’s probably feared for days or weeks that this indictment was coming. How bout this: In the thick of the 2016 campaign, Trump’s campaign chair leaves the country! To secretly meet with Russians! This is so unbelievable it’s hard for many to process. What nightmare are we in?
The criminal investigation of Trump has just boiled over onto the stove. Mueller has indicted the Kremlin operative who met with Trump Jr &amp; Jared in Trump Tower. He says Trump’s campaign chair shared private internal polling data with the Russians! So tonight is the distraction.
All federal workers who are being forced to work without pay, I encourage you to call in sick and not show up. Being forced to work for no pay was outlawed in 1863. It is illegal. A mass walkout would end the Trump shutdown within 48 hours.
2) This is a man you have told us lies to us an average of 10 lies a day.  If you do go ahead and give Trump this free, prime time airtime tonight, then I implore you to run on the screen a real-time LIVE fact-check for every sentence he utters. You owe this to your viewers.
1)To all TV Networks: Because u still claim to have journalistic standards, I ask that u not turn your/our airwaves over to Trump tonight to make massively false.statements that your own reporters have proven 2 be factually wrong. You MUST NOT give free air time 2 a known liar...
Half Time. Appears there are no terrorists that came in from Mexico. NBC News reports that in 2018 they caught a total of 6 who were on a possible watch list, whatever that is. Not “4,000”. Just another lie.

Same two teams. Over and over. Boring. A nation of 325 million and there’s nobody else? I guess not. Going to turn the TV off and go look for those 4,000 terrorists who’ve sneaked across the Mexican border. I’ll check in at half-time to let you know how I’m doing.

As of 11:30am this morning, the criminal governor of Michigan, Rick “The Tick” Snyder, will no longer be governor. He &amp; his people poisoned Flint. Then covered it up. I implore the new Dem governor Gretchen Whitmer to have him arrested—and to replace ALL the pipes in Flint ASAP.

An ode to my screensaver... https://t.co/oKU2VIUETO https://t.co/sd1WEgPkEz
With Alexandria and other newly-elected progressives, the old ways of the old guard of the Dem leadership will be exposed and we will learn so much as to why things don’t really seem to get better. Then it will be up to us to demand Dems stop collaborating with the enemy. https://t.co/5BNDlv7n67
On Thanksgiving, Trump said he was most thankful for... wait... wait... you guessed it: Himself. REPORTER: “What are you most thankful for, Mr. President?”  TRUMP: “...for having made a tremendous difference in this country. I’ve made a tremendous difference in the country!”
Thx for these new names as to who should run in 2020: Sally Yates, Andrew Gillum, Kamala Harris, Sherrod Brown, Richard Ojeda, Shaun King, Cecile Richards, Anthony Romero, Stacey Abrams, Marianne Williamson, Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom, Kate Brown, Amy Klobuchar, Bruuuce! Others?
We need to think outside the box. If a Lesbian Native American MMA fighter can be sent 2 Congress from KANSAS—the sky’s the limit! Sully Sullenberger. Michelle Obama. Tulsi Gabbard. Tom Hanks. LeBron! Bernie! Oprah! Beto! Streep! Why don’t we win for once! #Draft2020 Post a name!
Let’s name ourselves the “2020 Recruitment Committee” &amp; get the Thanksgiving Dinner conversation started! Our job: Find a BELOVED American who shares our VALUES and can WIN the White House in 2020. Think of a BOLD, fresh idea &amp; post w/ #Draft2020. I’ll start: Ellen Degeneres!

“President Trump declared his unswerving loyalty to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this morning... ‘Maybe he did it, maybe he didn’t!... In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.’” He’s sanctioning murder:  https://t.co/JqyKy6EEpN
Raking.  Faking. California aching.  America a-waking.  Trump quaking. 2020 is baking...
On a foreign visit today to California, the USA Leader (he wore a USA cap so the Californians would know where he’s from) declared that had the people of California done “more raking” these fires wouldn’t happen. He repeated that there is no “climate change” but “I want climate.” https://t.co/7omSRLgchz

The amazing racism of the New York Times. (Below)If the new progressive Dems we elected by a multi-million majority are to succeed, they will need 2 replace not only the tired old infrastructure of the Democratic Party, they will have 2 stop taking cues from neo-liberal entities. https://t.co/4kofjHeI1Z
I just want to say as this day ends—the 100th anniv. of the end of World War I—that all war is dumb, &amp; WWI was the friggin’ dumbest of all. 16 million killed for absolutely no effing reason! Useless, senseless, disgusting immoral, revolting — all leaders on both sides criminals.
Thank you. Sadly and wrongly, this film is never dated. https://t.co/3E2xr4Zmot
It has to feel awful knowing that your side is outnumbered by the millions and the only way you can hang on to any power is to simply rig it/steal it/prevent black people from voting. That is the work of cowards. https://t.co/ffGxaPDUHv
I’ll be on MSNBC w @Lawrence at 10pm ET. Tune-in!
OVER 1000 anti-Trump/pro Mueller investigation demonstrations taking place pall over the country beginning in less than two hours on the east cost. 5pm local time everywhere!! Show up!! https://t.co/vcjkaAngpm
RAPID RESPONSE!! Everyone to the streets TOMORROW (Thurs) at 5 PM local time! All the major activist groups plus thousands of individuals such as myself are calling for all to take a stand against Trump’s plans to fire Mueller. Here’s where to protest: https://t.co/de6Q2xRelo
The Parkland kids ignited a revolution. This is not the last u will hear from them. They did something yesterday that the Democratic Party &amp; anti-gun groups have been unable to pull off — they targeted and DEFEATED 27 NRA-backed candidates and Congressmen! This is just the start. https://t.co/j2rHLZlHvZ
Trump fires his attorney general. We all know where this is heading. Trump will fire the Special Prosecutor &amp; have all his evidence &amp; files either locked up or shredded. Lame-duck House Repubs will destroy anything that could lead to Trumps impeachment. DEMS! GET READY TO FIGHT!
I will be on Morning Joe on MSNBC this morning around 8:30am ET for a live recap of our victory yesterday and what now to do with the collateral damage known as Trump. Please tune in!
But the best news is that once again we WON the MOST votes throughout the whole country! In all the House races combined we got 3 MILLION MORE votes than the Repubs. And TEN MILLION MORE in the Senate races! The majority of Americans rejected Trump and all that he stands for!
There’s more! Dems flipped 7 governorships (incl. Kansas!). The 1st ever openly gay Governor (CO)won! Dems took control of the Senates in NY, ME &amp; CO. Repubs were tossed out of office from coast 2 coast! The House of Lords (US Senate which is not 1 person/1 vote) grew by 3 Repubs
VICTORY! We took the House with 35-40 NEW Democrats elected, the MAJORITY of them women! Two of them the first Muslim women ever in Congress. The 1st Native American woman ever elected to the House (over 500 years after the genicide began). The youngest woman ever elected (AOC!)!
The reason many of us got to vote today: “Caravans” like this that our great-grandparents came on to the US. Others came in chains. The hate spewed by Trump this past week in order to win — pls let it backfire profoundly. Trump last night: “A Blue Wave means a CRIME WAVE!” #Shame https://t.co/14mEt30GZr
There is still time to vote! As long as u are in line by the time the polls close, you can vote! Go now! And to anyone who is denied a chance to vote, demand a provisional ballot and call the Dept of Justice voter rights hotline: 800-253-3931

@shaunking Agreed. I’m in.
If they don’t let you vote, federal law says u can ask for a “PROVISIONAL BALLOT”. They HAVE to give you one and you get to fill it out and cast your vote. They will hold it and if the election is close lawyers from the Democratic Party will fight to have your vote included!

FACT: WE are the MAJORITY! Trump lost by 3M, the Dems won the prez popular vote EVERY TIME but once (‘04) since 1992, 78% of Americans don’t own a gun, 62% want socialized medicine for all, 82% support equal pay for women and 75% believe immigrants are great for the USA! #BOOM!
THIS IS THE RECKONING! Trump had to know this day would come. That a tsunami of women &amp; young people &amp; people of color would show up in record numbers at the polls. Millions showed up in DC twice - women &amp; students - to warn him what today would look like. In 12 hours we’ll know. https://t.co/hlKjtmzgjF
My very first vote was for Chisholm when I was 17 &amp; she ran for President in ‘72. The law says if you’re going to be 18 by the general election, you can vote in the primary if you’re 17.

C’mon San Diego! Don’t be the laughing stock of America! Your congressman, Duncan Hunter, is under indictment —by Trump’s Justice Dept!—for 60 different felonies! And yet he’s ahead in the polls?! I don’t care if it is 74 and sunny every day. Get your shit together! DUNCAN OUT!

I will be Chris Hayes’ last guest TONIGHT (around 8:45pm ET) on MSNBC. Please tune in. I have something I’d like to say before the polls open tomorrow — and if you have a few minutes afterwards, I’d love to hear your response.
As a neighbor to Wisconsin, I can tell you most of them are not idiots. Don’t let the cheesehead thing fool you. The get that they’ve been had. Vote EVERS for Governor! The Scott Walker Era of Deceit must come to an end. https://t.co/Fw9rlTqGYZ
Friends &amp; neighbors in Northern Michigan (including the U.P.): We MUST vote for MATT MORGAN and send him to Congress tomorrow. The madness of Trump must end. Matt is a veteran who believes in universal health care for all. He supports women’s rights. Vote! https://t.co/CHTriYT8WU

FELLOW MICHIGANDERS! I urge you to vote Whitmer/Gilchrist for Governor and Lt. Governor! The Republicans poisoned the people of Flint. They not only deserve defeat, some of them belong in prison. Please, for Flint, for me, vote DEM tomorrow! https://t.co/JmNdDAw7TP https://t.co/IPwOfL6iy3
MICHIGAN. WISCONSIN. PENNSYLVANIA. OHIO. 4 Great Lakes states that Obama won twice. 4 states that put Trump in the White House. Tomorrow, these 4 states are on the verge of turning blue! We can win the Governor's seat in all 4! A huge rebuke &amp; nightmare for Trump! Let’s do it!
More than one of these  yard signs spotted in Michigan... https://t.co/dwQV4BkcBJ
Here’s something you can do right now. Take an hour and go knock on every door on your street or in your bldg. Tell them you don’t work for any candidate, you’re just their neighbor and you wanted to share your feelings with them on how we have to get Dems elected on Tuesday.
IGNORE THE POLLSTERS! In this week's NY Times/Siena poll of the Senate race in Texas they reached out to 51,983 Texans. Only 800 gave them an answer! And of the 7,219 young voters (18-29 yrs old) they "polled", only 66 responded! Polls are wrong! Keep working &amp; making calls!

Today, Thursday, is the last day in 280 theaters across the US to see “Fahrenheit 11/9”. For two months I’ve offered this film as my warning. I hope it has worked. There will be no other chance to right the ship after Nov. 6th. If Trump’s enablers stay in Congress, that’s it. https://t.co/yys613oG3Y

In the past few hours, my crew and I have realized that Cesar Sayoc plastering my picture with a bullseye on it on his van was NOT our first encounter with him. We actually filmed him in 2017... https://t.co/wBfjBNMZ0O
This tragic week began on Monday with the President of the United States declaring at one of his proto-fascist rallies who he really is with one single  frightening sentence: “I AM A NATIONALIST! USE THAT WORD!” The six days  following that statement proved that he wasn’t alone.
Love &amp; solidarity to all our Jewish brothers &amp; sisters. Excuse me, fellow gentiles, didn’t we all agree that we would NEVER let something like this happen again? That we would, at the first HINT of fascism, put an end to it before it grew into something worse? That moment is now.

I’ll be live on Chris Hayes TONIGHT on MSNBC at 8pm ET. Much to discuss, including how we win in 12 days.
At 7:18am this morning, just 30minutes after the news broke of the bomb at Robert De Niro’s offices, u tweeted your latest threat to the media, blaming them for bringing this terrorism on themselves. You are sick. But don’t worry. A cure for your vile behavior is coming in 12days https://t.co/hctGHMtkSP
Trump — you know EXACTLY what you’re doing when you threaten repercussions against the media and violence against your opponents and, in your most infamous act of hate, your shout-out to your “Second Amendment people” to take action against Hillary — “you know what to do.” https://t.co/zPxe7eEsTM
Bomb package just discovered outside Robert De Niro’s Tribeca Film Center. Cowards. There are  at least 66 million of us. That’s a lot of flag stamps.
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Donald Trump totally &amp; completely understands what he is doing. The only ones w/o “comprehension” of what is going on are most of the media, politicians and law enforcement who can’t go after the man in the Oval Office who has continually encouraged violence https://t.co/xoUtXcxild
This “caravan” has been going on for 20 years as refugees flee the violence of Guatemala, Honduras &amp; El Salvador. Most end up in Mexico &amp; are assisted by international refugee groups. Few walk the 1,000+ miles to the US. Trump is using this racist fear tactic to win the Midterms. https://t.co/AIA8YyEqgF
So here we have a beautiful aerial shot—just in time 4 the Midterms! And everyone falls for it. This is one of the most remote areas of the WesternHemisphere. Try finding a helicopter/drone down there to film this. You can’t. Trump’s genius is how he once again outsmarts the Dems https://t.co/jamknIBYxI
Think of all the BS you’ve been fed. And then that day comes &amp; you just turn it off, you flip the switch, and you begin livin’ your friggin’ life the way you want to. In that moment, you are the most wonderfully dangerous person on the planet. Take the leap! Fuck ‘em all! https://t.co/zqEwZFDKsB
Clearly, Khashoggi’s face ran into a Saudi’s fist, a fist with such sharp fingernails, said fingernails beheaded him accidentally and then dismembered him.
Of course! KHASHOGGI DIED BOXING! Trump and the Saudi dictator finally have their lying story worked out: “An argument broke out between Mr. Khashoggi and men who met him inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, leading to ‘a fistfight that led to his death.’” (NY Times)
Hey followers in the UK and Dublin — “Fahrenheit 11/9” begins today in theaters across both countries! It’s about what’s happened to us from my point of view. A satirical “horror” movie. You may find some resemblance!  Here’s where it’s showing:  https://t.co/uSBEPhf4TL https://t.co/tHcQkfCcJ8

Before you go to sleep tonight, on this night of a day of historic American shame, make a promise to yourself that one month from today, on November 6th, you will take the day off, knock on doors, make calls, bring 5 to 10 people with you to vote &amp; make a g-damn party out of it! https://t.co/rILxloIgae

David- it’s ok! Everyone has a lot going on. So sorry you missed it. As I’m self-distributing my own film, I can only keep theaters for just so long. So, hey, everybody - don’t put off seeing “Fahrenheit 11/9”! It won’t last long! Go today! https://t.co/bc2rzKEx56
FOUR STARS from so many critics! “Blistering!” “Fierce!” “A Masterpiece!” After the week this country has just gone through, there is no better place to be this weekend than in a theater watching “Fahrenheit 11/9”! See it with fellow citizens in a righteous rage! https://t.co/pOYhUhObiH

So what have we learned today?  1. There’s no such thing as a “moderate Republican” south of the Arctic Circle 2. We won’t forget that 1 yr 2 the day of the demise of one predator(HW), we put another 1 on the Supreme Court 3. We are 1 day closer to the impeachment of B. Kavanaugh
⁦@amyschumer⁩— so proud of u 4 occupying w/thousands of protesters today the Hart Senate bldg. — and being detained by the Capitol Police! Congrats to you and all the brave people who took over Capitol Hill today — and to all who are camped out tonight to raise hell on Fri. https://t.co/nTZsYeW6Sm
Correct. https://t.co/Z6CoJK4mNA
The courageous, militant, ferocious protesters in DC whom Kavanaugh has sparked r our ONLY chance now. NOT the friggin’ FBI. They were never going to rescue us! Positive change in America comes from the people who r on the FBI Watchlist, NOT from those on the fucking FBI payroll.
@thelittleidiot We must all get as many ppl to the polls on Nov 6 to vote for the Dems on the ballot. But if we don’t stay on top of them they, like most politicians, will not put the ppl 1st. The Republicans have only won the popular vote ONCE in last 30yrs! Yet we hold NO power! Embarrassing!
@kathygriffin But seriously, here’s how our side can stop losing (especially since we’ve won the popular vote in 6 of last 7 prez elections): 1. Next time send the candidate to MI &amp; WI; 2. Pick a candidate beloved by the American ppl; 3. Record turnout at the Midterms! Me? I just made a movie.
@kathygriffin C’mon, Kathy, let’s not lose our heads over this!
You don’t need an FBI investigation to tell you which one was lying &amp; which one was telling the truth. I don’t need someone to do a background check for me to tell me which one of the below likes me &amp; which one doesn’t. It’s called instinct, it nearly always works, and it’s free. https://t.co/KkvaKIjHqr
“This is a cover-up not a confirmation process” https://t.co/QcU8VF1o2m
5 days ago Dems &amp; “liberals” did the same old thing, claiming some empty “victory” when Flake feigned “shame, and then foolishly placing their hopes in the FBI - THE FBI! - doing an “investigation.” When is our side going to wake up and start FIGHTING? Stop hoping &amp; start acting!
You may cry, but it will be cathartic and you will come out on the other side with a new resolve. This movie gives you something no one else has given you. https://t.co/buW6CSIZNQ

The Governor of Michigan is a criminal for poisoning the people of Flint. The man who should have arrested him, his Republican Attorney General, has let him skate. Now this Atty Gen wants to be the new Governor. OVER THE DEAD BODIES OF THE PEOPLE OF FLINT! https://t.co/DIpAp7IY41

Time’s up, Senators. You are all Brett Kavanaughs and you are all about to find out what an electoral boofing feels like. Get out your Kavanaugh calendars! Circle November 6th! You’re going to have a lot of time soon to drink as much beer as you want over at PJ’s house.
Let not one of these Senators have a moment of rest, let’s make their lives justly miserable and let’s throw as many of them and their colleagues in the House out of office. The only thing they hate more than a woman with rights is them losing their own golden meal ticket.
...their seat at the table (see: apartheid; South Africa). Make no mistake about it — this is a rebellion, and the peaceful, vigorous overthrow will happen on November 6th if tens of millions join it. I have joined it. Will you? I’m guessing you already have.
This is what eventually happens when a minority (men-48.5% of the population) try to rule over and take rights away from the majority (women-51.5%—the majority eventually rise up and overthrow the minority who have controlled their lives, their bodies, their unequal income...
THAT is why these citizens are hounding these Senators because these Senators believe they have a right to lord over the lives of 165 million women. Well, they don’t. And if they think these protesters are making their lives “miserable,” they haven’t seen anything yet.
...by declaring, in effect, “WE own your ovaries, WE decide what you can and cannot do with your bodies, and YOU will shut up and do what WE say if you find yourself unexpectedly with a fertilized egg inside your body.” THAT is what the Brett Kavanaugh vote is about.
This vote is not about Brett Kavanaugh’s assault on Christine Ford’s body (which that alone should be enough to vote down his nomination) — this vote is about how 51 Republican Senators and five men on the Supreme Court plan to assault EVERY woman’s rights to her own body...
...because these Senators are planning to vote to make women’s lives more than just miserable — they plan to destroy a women’s right to choose. They plan to place themselves and the Supreme Court IN CHARGE of women’s reproductive organs.
Major props to all citizens who are peacefully confronting Republican Senators anywhere they find them. In the halls of Congress, in their fancy restaurants, in their driveways. Stopping them, blocking them, shouting them down, making their day to day lives miserable...
“It was just a test. But make no mistake about it. This is the world in which we now live.” That’s my final line in “Fahrenheit 11/9”.  A few minutes ago, Trump gave us a preview of the state of emergency he is creating to justify the end of democracy as we know it. RESIST! https://t.co/M8g3NebFQ2

Thank you Bill! Will add a second run of new movie posters just for Halloween: “FAHRENHEIT 11/9 IS BRILLIANT! VERY POWERFUL! IT WILL SCARE THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF YOU! YOU’LL BE SO SICK IT WILL MAKE YOU RUN TO THE POLLS! GO SEE IT! FOUR STARS!!” https://t.co/R1ou5KTagn
Thank you Canadians for loving my film! Ordering the new posters now for ‘Fahrenheit 11/9’: “A MASTERPIECE! THE FIRST 15 MINUTES WERE MORE DISTURBING THAN THE OPENING OF ‘SAVING PRIVATE RYAN’! IT WAS SO GREAT, I FELT PHYSICALLY ILL! GO SEE IT! FOUR STARS (five Canadian)!!” https://t.co/zqG4Y9Luv8
A teachers revolution is underway all across the country. It began in West Virginia at the beginning of 2018, we were there filming it, it’s spread to a dozen states, and this Wednesday the teachers in the LA school district may walk. Please support all teachers! #Fahrenheit119 https://t.co/EU6KMsSkVd
https://t.co/tVBQmpW4Oy
Yes. Help teens get in. This should not be an R rated film. https://t.co/qz2Hi5AjuG
Wow. Thanks. What a great mom you are! As for my “cast” — I had no say in the casting for this film. They we’re forced on me by the electoral college. https://t.co/ges8HuCmED
I hope the cry was a cathartic one. We are all in despair. My movie I hope will ignite a voters revolution. https://t.co/9nrUn1soGS
Wow! This is the best thanks you could give me by making that commitment for Election Day. https://t.co/SkqKUmzK2A
You’re welcome! https://t.co/1MRdWuTpFI
Thank you Grand Lake Theater in Oakland, CA for not enforcing the R rating on my film and allowing tweens and teens in to see it. “Political Discourse Must Not Be Stifled”. We all agree! https://t.co/henfOSDQVk
“The Friendly Fascism of the 21st Century will not be like the fascism of the 20th Century. The fascism of the 21st Century will not come with swastikas and concentration camps. It will come, instead, with a Smiley Face and a TV show. And this time it will succeed.” https://t.co/9RvM83WD62

Variety calls Fahrenheit 11/9 “Fesrless and profound... Moore captures how the groundwork is being laid for a full-scale destruction of democracy. The movie is a warning: It says, quite wisely, take action now or you may no longer have the opportunity to do so.” Go see it! https://t.co/0gBFsJlKmE
From Variety’s exceptional review: “Fahrenheit 11/9 is truly about something, and that’s Michael Moore’s fearless — and I would say accurate — perception that what’s going on in our government today is more sinister than even a lot of liberals think.” https://t.co/sqyPTxtrZY
Wow. Thank you. Your quote should be on the poster: “You’ll throw up...a little!” Four Stars! https://t.co/4VLVDs3hKG
Thank you Lori! So glad you’re taking your teenager. Parents— even though this film is rated R it’s not because of Trump’s racism but because of f-bombs and a few scenes from the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas H.S. In Parkland, FL. Tweens an teens can and should watch this film! https://t.co/kR6LUSgUS9
“Michael Moore’s terrifying ‘Fahrenheit 11/9’: Trump is the symptom, not the disease... This movie is a tour de force.” An amazing, wonderful analysis of my new film. In theaters now. https://t.co/XLhqSNDeej
Thank you so much. This is how I’ve seen people leaving the theater at the end of the movie: 1) Shaken to their core, and 2) On fire with a resolve to take them all down in November. Encourage ppl to see this film as we are building an army of voters who are going to fight &amp; win! https://t.co/ifCGoNjkYu
Wow! Melissa, I cannot believe that u are offering to pay people’s way to go see my movie! I’ve never heard of such a thing. It’s acts like this that convince me a revolt is brewing &amp; the Trump supporters in Congress are going 2 be crushed. Wow. I don’t know you but I sure love u https://t.co/dnWSWcIc8z
Live now after a screening of “Fahrenheit 11/9” talking about a difficult few days for our country: https://t.co/3WSYzH3nIz https://t.co/UpA1M1qr9j
Has this not been 2 of the most depressing days 2 be an American? Everywhere I’ve been today people have been depressed, demoralized, in tears. Myself included.I want 2 go be w/ like-minded ppl 2 commiserate. I think I’ll start by ducking into my own movie in the nearest theater!
Why is Trump in such a rush? Remember he is the master distractor, the king of the misdirect. It’s always the one thing &amp; then it’s the other. He’s always lying but he’s always telling you the truth about what he intends to do. We got here w/ Trump because we’ve always been here. https://t.co/xWhx5FxJew
Respect for @AnaMariaArchil2 &amp; the others who just demonstrated that @JeffFlake, who admitted Dr Ford was a credible witness, has no words when confronted on why he will vote to confirm an accused sexual predator Kavanuagh who was appointed by the sexual predator in chief https://t.co/M6QBALEESv
Wow. Yes. https://t.co/12c4gucOFy
Just got home from work, turned on C-SPAN to watch Kavanaugh’s “testimony.” So far he has done nothing but yell at the Senators, fight back tears over his weightlifting as a teen, and shouted about a dozen times, “I LIKE BEER!” He is so UNHINGED he should never serve on ANY court
It’s the best way 2 see “Fahrenheit11/9”! Horror films are not 2 be watched alone! Bring family, friends,  dates, nonvoters. Thank u LaMelle family 4 joining hundreds of thousands of others this week watching the movie New York magazine says is “one of the most urgent films ever” https://t.co/7eMfetBRzY
Men! The time 2 end this treatment of women is NOW. Let the Senate know we will be in the streets this week if they push Brett Kavanaugh through. We have known and watched these “Bretts” our whole lives. Their behavior has always been repulsive. #CancelKavanugh  TY Women’s March! https://t.co/ataXQyKZhD
Everyone of us who worked on this film felt this way for all eight months of production. And, like many at the end of watching this movie, we were ignited, on fire, ready to fight and to win. Thank you. https://t.co/vys7YmU9sL

My thoughts about my new film, FAHRENHEIT 11/9, just hours now before its world premiere tonight at the Opening Night of the Toronto International Film Festival. https://t.co/ZZyF67csCs
When he told us last month that what you see and hear is not actually what is happening, he’s telling you the truth - about himself!  Remember— he is always lying and he is always telling you the truth. That is his weapon — and we must disarm him ASAP.
He has been trying various things to create a “crisis”, an “emergency” so that he can get rid of people, enact executive orders, start a war. He knows how easy it is to instill fear in Americans and how to manipulate our darkest tendencies (racism). He’s doing it now.
... then we will never defeat him. He’s the master distracter, the king of the misdirect, &amp;he’s playing us all again so he can get Kavanaugh on the SC. If u cannot accept that he HATES women(except for one use)&amp; plans to take their rights away-beginning w/ CHOICE-then we r doomed
Remember, Trump controls his destiny. He is smarter than all of us. Oh, really? You don’t believe that? Right. To quote him: “That’s why I’m President and you’re not!” He won by LOSING by 3 million votes. Would you or I know how to do that? If we can’t respect his evil genius...
A different theory: Trump (or more likely a minion of his) wrote that NYTimes op-ed. It was done to distract all of u from the fact that the Senate RIGHT NOW is holding hearings that will lead to the elimination of Roe v Wade. Or he did it to create chaos he needs to clean house.

My feelings exactly. Trump didn’t need to be there. He’s always been there. He was there today &amp; he’ll be with us til the end of time unless we grasp how the ruling class rules us without deference to party or title. They ALL belong to the same club &amp; they have each other’s back. https://t.co/CzCMTZxTHx

...Dem voters yesterday outnumbered Republicans in this area 2 to 1! And here’s 1 more indication of how we may win in Nov: In Marquette Co., our write-in Dem candidate got MORE votes as a write-in than the incumbent Republican candidate got with his name on the ballot! (3/3)
... and not only set a RECORD turnout for a midterm election, we got over 30,000 write-in votes for our Democratic candidate, Matt Morgan! This has never happened before! LONG lines of voters—so many voters that, even though Trump had won this district with 56% of the vote...
It appears that Republican voter suppression in Michigan's 1st Congressional District has failed in an historic way! By using a technicality, the Republicans on the election commission kicked the lone Democratic candidate off the ballot. So thousands of us mobilized... (1/3) https://t.co/QQKs9M8vNc

It’s Primary ELECTION DAY in Michigan! Polls open 7am. Let’s all show up. Let’s make sure these are not the last days of democracy.
Hey! Hey! Detroit! And Redford, River Rouge &amp; Romulus, too! We have a chance to send a bright, shining star to DC in tomorrow’s primary. Imagine a Congresswoman who will FIGHT for us! I can’t sing her praises enough. Please vote RASHIDA tomorrow! https://t.co/VtdAp7kalP

Likewise, Congress needs no more proof than Trump’s admission yesterday that he sides with Putin to impeach &amp; remove him. No hearings are needed. Fast action is a must. The House should vote to Impeach &amp; the Senate should hold the trial. Those who don’t act should be tossed Nov 6
In Trump’s stunning act of open, televised treason yesterday, it is clear the Russians are holding him hostage by whatever they got on him or whatever harm they are threatening to do to a family member of his. For his and our safety, he must be removed from office. 25th Amendment
Trump: “They (my intelligence officers) said, ‘I think it is Russia.’ I have President Putin (standing here). He just said it is not Russia. I will say this: I do not see any reason why it would be (Russia).”  Arrest Trump when Air Force One lands. I want to see him in chains.
Trump is asked, Who are you going to believe—the Russians or your own officers? And he refused to choose! Do you support your troops or Putin — and he wouldn’t choose! So my first thought goes out to those who serve this country— I’m so sorry the Commander-in-Chief is a traitor.
Wow oh wow. I’ve expected  many things from Trump — but never did I think I’d see him standing beside the president of Russia and, as John King just reported on CNN, “surrendering to him.” That Trump would reveal himself as a traitor on worldwide TV — well, that was a mind-blower

Ah, the good old days. Best buds Brett Kavanaugh and Karl Rove. https://t.co/OtVQPRxv2X
Ah, well, yes. Makes sense. We’ve devolved to the point where a president who brags about sexually assaulting women would choose a political operative obsessed with where Bill Clinton’s semen landed. Wake up this morning &amp; call your Senator and say “Vote NO!” 202-235-3121. Please https://t.co/1jTfmlpS4I
So you’re getting the point —he now believes that Presidents are above the law. They shouldn’t even have to answer questions from law enforcement. Trump wants to make sure he’s got a majority of justices on his side when the Feds try to haul him away. This must be opposed by all! https://t.co/KNKf4GHiNy
What else do you need to know about Brett Kavanaugh other than he worked with Ken Starr to impeach Clinton, worked to help W win Bush v Gore Supreme Court case, and worked in both Bush White Houses. Recommended to Bush to put Alito and Roberts on the Court. He must be stopped.

Ah, our second Valentine’s Day in the Trump Era. So many ashes.
So if Netanyahu resigns: 1. Trump can name him White House Chief-of-Staff; 2. Netanyahu, who has wall-building experience, can then build Trump’s wall along Mexican border; 3. Downside: Miscommunication and wrong location leads to brutal 50+ year occupation of Palestine, Texas.

Lest too many people started singing along at home to “Imagine no heaven, no religion, no possessions,” Katie Couric was quick to point out the (true) human rights violations of North Korea. Spoken by a person from a nation run on mass incarceration, and 30M w/ no health care.
I just loved the whole F-Trump opening to the Olympics last night. From all Koreans coming in together under one blue flag of peace, to Pence &amp; “mother” forced to sit in front of Kim’s sister, to the popular Korean singers joining together to sing John Lennon’s “Imagine” - BOOM!

How MLK Day was celebrated in Detroit.

And, as I’ve said before, don’t miss these two incredible movies: “Lady Bird” and “3 Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri.” And it’s never too late to catch the brilliant “Get Out” now playing on HBO. And the powerful “Mudbound” on Netflix.
Also: Go see “Hostiles”. Christian Bale stars in this powerful film, set in the yr after our last official massacre of the 400 yr-long genocide of the Native peoples. A bigoted Army Captain is ordered 2 escort a dying Indian chief back to his homeland. A profound piece of cinema
Great films 2 go see this weekend in theaters: “The Post”, a brilliant Spielberg film about while the NY Times was dutifully obeying a judge &amp; not publishing the secret documents that exposed the lies of the VietnamWar, the woman running the Washington Post said F-it &amp; ran them.

This is true. And just to put a finer point on it, Lawrence was calling Trump, who @ that time was a top star making a ton o money 4 Lawrence’s parent network, NBC, a RACIST.

In the morning, when u wake up, call your Senators &amp;members of Congress — 202-225-3121 — &amp; say, "I'm an American. My family originally came from the shithole country of (fill in the blank). On Nov 6th, I will be bringing my shithole self &amp; and a shitload of others to the polls."
ALL journalists from now on, when referring to Trump, must use the word “racist” as a factual description of him. “The racist president of the US, Donald Trump, flew today to...” Or, “Trump, a racist, met with leaders of Congress...” Or,“Today, the racist Trump, signed a bill...”
To paraphrase Stephen Colbert, those aren’t  “shithole countries” because their president isn’t Donald Trump.

The University of Alabama. Who cares. Trump walked  out on the field. The Distractor attends the distraction. What public lands did the Trump give away yesterday? What environmental regulations were eliminated yesterday? 25% of Alabama is black. Only 10% of U of Alabama is black.
"10 Days in the Valley" got its final eps tonite on ABC. One of the best shows on TV. A rare drama on a broadcast network on the level of Netflix, HBO, AMC, etc. There is now not a single hour show that I watch on NBC, ABC, CBS or FOX. Great work &amp; congrats to Kyra Sedgwick &amp; co!

Where does Trump get off plagiarizing himself by calling Bannon “Sloppy Steve” after first calling me “Sloppy Michael Moore” back in October? Does Bannon realize he’s really the sloppy seconds? That I’m the original “Sloppy Mike?” This whole thing is all pretty damn sloppy. https://t.co/3CIXdaL9sY

38 states are needed to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment for women. 36 have already voted YES! We only need 2 more. C’mon! What’s wrong with you Illinois? Virginia? Florida? We can do this. WE ARE THE MAJORITY. All running 4 office in 2018 must be asked: “Do u support the ERA?” https://t.co/iOZSVvGZxp
1. Elect women. 2. Pass the Equal Rights Amendment. 3.  Equal pay for equal work.
The majority gender makes 79 cents on the male dollar, holds only 19% of the seats in Congress, &amp; Hollywood let’s ‘em make 4 movies (out of 200) a year. No woman anchors the nightly news on the 3 broadcast networks. This too is an assault. Men fear the discussion will turn 2 this

When Hitler called Jews "dirty" and "subhuman," was it enough to say he was just "crazy" &amp; "unfit for office?" Trump is dangerous. IMPEACH!
The only thing left to decide about Trump is do we try him as an adult?
It is utter denial is to keep repeating that Trump has been able to get little or nothing done. His Fed agencies have decimated this country

According to the Wash Post, while there are over 300 million+ guns in people's homes in the US, just 3% own more than 150 million of them!
77% of Americans DON'T own a gun. Nearly 90% want STRONGER gun control. It is NOT a democracy if a vicious few control what the law will be.
I think millions of Americans want to say to those who have suffered loss and tragedy in Las Vegas, "We won't be quiet. We will end this."

5. Send in all Army truck drivers to get those trucks full of supplies that are now sitting on the docks moving out to the people...
4. Send in the 82nd Airborne! They can do anything and everything!...
3. Fly Air Force cargo planes, criss-crossing over the island, and parachute-drop supplies everywhere to the people.
2. Send aircraft carriers loaded w/ helicopters 2 Puerto Rico. They can easily airlift water, food &amp; medicine to every part of the island...
1. Send the ENTIRE Army Corps of Engineers IMMEDIATELY 2 Puerto Rico.They can rebuild infrastructure &amp; restore electricity &amp; cell service...

Michael Moore Leads Audience In Trump Tower Protest After Broadway Show | Deadline https://t.co/WRyqJZMjbo
Our protest is over for the night at Trump Tower. CNN asked me to stop by. I'll be live with Don Lemon in a few minutes.
..."When's the last time you saw a President defend white nationalism?" Wow. Never. I wasn't alive in the 1850s. ALL MUST EXPRESS OUTRAGE!
Chuck Todd, voice shaking, stated that Trump "conflated the Confederacy with the American Revolution..."
Chuck Todd just now on MSNBC: "I'm shaken by what I just witnessed...He (Trump) painted the white supremacists as the victims."
OMG. What did we just watch? He blamed the anti-racism protesters. He likened George Washington to Robert E. Lee. Donald. Trump. Fuck. You.
Mr. President, I'm going to pay you a visit tonight. https://t.co/QupKIW9Ckh

Convince a beloved progressive right now to run  against the Republican in your district. Form a citizens brigade 2 get her (or him) elected
Someone like:everyone's fav high school teacher; an IraqWar vet; a local TVpersonality; owner of everyone's fav diner; top athlete; a woman.
Find the most beloved person in your district to run. Someone people would love to vote 4. NOT a "politician." Then work like hell for them.
Of the 435 seats in the House, we only have to flip 24 of them from Repub to Dem to take control in next yrs election. Only 3 Senate seats.

And then there's the psychosuperhero called Trump.He wins every battle even when he loses.NOTHING touches him. Suddenly that's gonna change?
The investigation'll require work, many witnesses, possible grand jury, due process 4 Trump &amp; public hearings. This aint happening next week
Special PROSECUTOR Mueller is investigating high crimes and treason. He has full prosecutorial powers. He is not "counseling" anyone. Stop.
Note to Media: The term is Special PROSECUTOR not Special "Counsel." No one is being "counseled" here. Mueller is not offering his "counsel"

On Trumps last words, many Dems get up &amp; walk out. Republican applause doesn't even last til Trump makes it to begin his walk up the aisle.
Now the lying begins w/ his "jobs" creation since Jan20. Please-is there a network who'll run a crawl w/ the facts @ the bottom of screen?
Already pushing his so-called election victory. Still believes he got more votes. It was an "earthquake" all right.
Greetings Citizens of Sub- America!

Bill Paxton, RIP. Favorite Bill Paxton film: Carl Franklin's "0ne False Move" (1992). A sad loss. "Big Love" on HBO was amazing.
Other great movies from this year: "I, Daniel Blake"; "Captain Fantastic"; "Don't Think Twice"; "20th Century Women"; Maggie's Plan".
Hidden Figures - By far, the most popular film I've shown at my theater. Such an important movi2! I made it free to the students in my town.
1 of the best crowd-pleasers I've shown this yr @ my Michigan theater is "Lion." It's the kind of film ppl keep saying "make more of these!"
"Moonlight"- when all stories get told, we all are a better people. That this story exists on film says much about the progress we're making
"Fences." Brilliant August Wilson drama about a man who could have been a great Major Leaguer - but he was a black man in 1940s USA. Denzel!
"Hacksaw Ridge" - a brave film about a pacifist serving in WWII and the battle of Okinawa. Mel Gibson's redemption. Yes, believe.
"Hell or High Water" - a film set amidst this era of greedy banks and the struggle of two brothers to get by. Jeff Bridges!
"13th" - a necessary film all should see! "I Am Not Your Negro", a stunning movie with the words of James Baldwin. A must-see!!!!
La La Land - c'mon, we all need 2 take a few moments right now 4 a song and dance! Especially on the 405! California must lead the way!
Manchester by the Sea. Powerful, honest story, by a great storyteller, Kenneth Lonergan. If u come from the working class, u know these ppl.
Oscars. So many good films this year. Saw "Arrival" the day after the election and it was one of those moments where art lifts the soul.

Um, @realDonaldTrump -- It's now noontime in DC &amp; it appears you are still squatting in our Oval Office. I gave u til this morning to leave.
Hey @realDonaldTrump-1hr after Obama put sanctions on Russia YOU told Flynn 2 call them &amp; promise em it'll be OK. Traitor!Resign by morning!
The Washington Post &amp; NY Times now reporting Trump HAS KNOWN FOR A MONTH Flynn lied about the Russian call - and Trump did nothing. #IMPEACH
TRUMP KNEW EVERYTHING. It will all come out. Along with the rest of Trump's collusion &amp; obedience to Putin. #IMPEACH https://t.co/HGdvgjHumY
Let's be VERY clear: Flynn DID NOT make that Russian call on his own. He was INSTRUCTED to do so.He was TOLD to reassure them. Arrest Trump.
Flynn was colluding w/ a foreign gov't accused of helping throw the election 2 Trump,promising them they would be taken care of. Arrest him.

Now that Flynn is gone, he can rejoin his son in pedaling the story that Hillary was running a pedophile ring out of Comet Pizza. #security

Thanks to Betsy &amp; Co. 80% of our charter schools in MI are FOR PROFIT- a BILLION-$$ industry. Because what are children 4 if not to make $$
Just so we're clear: Betsy &amp; her Amway fam bought this Cabinet position 4 her, giving over $200Million to Republican candidates thru the yrs
Our great state of Michigan has given you Donald Trump (10K vote margin) &amp; Betsy DeVos (she's worked tirelessly here to destroy our schools)
Perhaps someone should call Child Protective ServIces. #senaterepublicans
The Senate Republicans have just sent a big FU to the school children of America. Even the worst countries don't shit on their own kids.

Ok admit it, some of u r thinking,I hope he ends with: "The conspiracy theorists were right about 1 thing: I ain't leavin' office next week"
This isn't so much a "farewell speech" (he ain't goin' anywhere) as it is a lecture in how democracy works to one Donald J. Trump.
He said the F word. Fascism.

My friends, let this be the day we resolve to takeover the Democratic Party. The Old Guard has to go. Youth. The New Americana. The #NewDems
Protesters in House gallery shouted "ONE PERSON ONE VOTE!" and "WE the People". All were ejected. Not one Democratic Senator rose to object.
Rep. Maxine Waters rose near end and pleaded for just ONE Senator to object because 50 electoral votes were cast illegally. Not one objected
One after another the (mostly) African American members of Congress were silenced just now by the Senate preident. Not one Senator objected.
On C-Span now, watch live as Republicans in the control booth cut the microphone of Dem members of Congress who object to Electoral College.
Dem members of Congress are objecting 2 illegal electors but no debate allowed unless 1 Dem Senator objects.NOT ONE DEM SENATOR WILL OBJECT!
Like pallbearers @ a funeral, the boxes with Electoral votes are coming into Congress. The Will of the People, RIP https://t.co/GsVcigZhNH
As Senate pages carry the wooden boxes with the ElectoralCollege votes into Congress right now, they look like pallbearers carrying a coffin
From my film, 16yrs ago on this day when Congress approved ElectoralCollege vote of a man who lost the popular vote: https://t.co/8l5mwJTfI9
https://t.co/l0At5KJs71
Rep. Lee will object to 50 Republican Electoral College votes that have been found 2 violate state and federal laws. Call Congress now!.
Who's gonna pay for that Wall? MEXICO! Who's gonna pay for that Wall? MEXICO! Who's gonna pay for that Wall? MEXICO! Who's gonna pay for tha

Time for tonight's walk! Who's with me? Just 30 minutes. Shoes. Jacket. Door. Nothing else.
(5/5) 10am-12pm: Cong. switchboard still jammed with citizens' calls. At noon, Repubs give up, withdraw proposal. VICTORY! Public pressure!
(4/5)...10:07am: Trump sees public's anger, reverses position, Tweets he thinks Ethics Office is "unfair" but today is not day to kill it...
(3/5)...6am-10am: Many of us rally the public to revolt by calling Congress. Thousands flood the Congressional switchboard w/ angry calls...
(2/5)...the public was quickly outraged. This Morn 7-9am: Kellyanne Conway goes on Today Show to defend Repubs for killing Ethics Office...
(1/5) Here's the Timeline for how the Citizens Revolt resulted in victory today: Mon. night: House Repubs vote to kill Ethics Office and...
Seriously- lazy, mainstream, celebrity-fawning, Trump-enabling media- do your job. It's the 1st day of Congress &amp; you haven't changed a bit.
Media, get it right: Trump isn't against gutting of EthicsOffice, just the "timing."And Ford has NOT ended its pledge 2 build cars in Mexico
Media pundits will credit Trump 4 Repubs backing down but he only questioned their timing &amp; ONLY after the public flooded their switchboard
First victory! House switchboard jammed with calls from citizens opposed to Republicans killing its Ethics Office. Repubs &amp; Trump back off.
In a few minutes the Republicans convene their Trump-era Congress. They must hear from you on Day One. https://t.co/gaXNhMdGBL

Coming on the air just minutes after Rachel"s amazing interview with KellyAnne Conway. It's electric here on the 3rd floor of 30 Rock!
In a few minutes I'll be on the @Lawrence O'Donnell Christmas Show on MSNBC at 10:15pm ET tonight. Tune in for a surprise holiday duet.
6. Ok, people are starting to wake up in the US. I wish I could give u better news. As bad as it seems, it will be worse. We are broken.
5. Trump is not president until 12 noon on Jan 20th. So we'll continue to fight &amp; hope to find a legal, nonviolent way to stop this madness.
4. Yes, it is ironic that this racist idea, the Electoral College, 225 years later ended up benefiting the candidate who spewed racism hate.
3. In the 1700s, 2 get the slave states 2 join the USA, those states got "extra votes" letting them count their slaves but not let them vote
2. Hillary Clinton won the election on Nov 8 by 2.8 million votes over Donald Trump. Which is to say, she lost. U r right, not a democracy.
1. Hello rest of the world! My fellow Americans are asleep right now so I thought we could talk &amp;maybe I can explain what happened yesterday
He's not president for four and a half weeks. Next idea?
Republican electors - my offer remains: If u vote your conscience &amp; u are fined 4 doing this, I will pay your fine. U should not be punished
Electors: you're not seriously going to appoint a president whom the majority of Americans on election day said  they didn't want?
@realDonaldTrump - In 30min EC(which u said before election was "a disaster for democracy")begins. Scared? A little? Only need 38 defections
Republican Electors -- If you vote your conscience at noon and your state fines you for this, I will pay your fine: https://t.co/LIFVD4xjD4

The CIA has determined Russia hacked into our election to help elect Donald J. Trump. Now Trump names Putin best friend as OUR Sec of State!
ExconMobil CEO Rex Tillerson received from V. Putin Russia's HIGHEST civilian honor, their version of our Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Trump's Sec of State: ExxonMobil CEO. That's 10 billionaires/millionaires &amp; 3 generals. Fascism's the marriage of the corp. &amp; military state

TO-DO LIST Item #1: Progressive Dems must take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. Fire current DNC.

CNN: "FBI Director Confirms Clinton Email Probe OVER!" Republicans will now pretend that didn't just happen.

Whoa. Internal polling showing Michigan has tightened - and they've ALL decided to spend the final day of the campaign in Michigan. #Brexit https://t.co/ulzjLZ2zLy
When Hillary 1st came to D.C. she was put through the fire. She dared to say that times had changed &amp; she wasn't going to be in the kitchen. https://t.co/HToSZGkDUD
NBC News just reported that.  Trump has re-focused 2 "drill down" on Michigan &amp; Clinton'll spend her final day there on Mon- it's THAT close
Just voted!! Woohoo!! HILLARY, dammit! A vote for kindness and compassion and AGAINST misogyny, racism &amp; greed. #USA https://t.co/xclQliSmS3

FBI agents tell the Guardian the agency is pro-Trump and anti-Hillary. Agent calls the FBI "TrumpLand."
Hey @realDonaldTrump -- no need to be in Wilmington, Ohio. Why's your crowd so small? Because TrumpLand is now HillaryLand!
Trump, in desperation 4 the damage I may've caused him, is in Wilmington, OH (where I performed &amp; filmed my show) to try &amp; win em back. #ha

I'll be on with Jake Tapper in a few minutes on CNN. #TrumpLand
I've been saying it for months but the media, the ClintonCampaign &amp; the politico elites prefer their own narrative. Let's all hope I'm wrong
On the morning of the MI primary this year, these were the pollsters predictions. 12 hrs later Bernie won. #WAKEUP https://t.co/r9VT3kMxYJ
In the MI (blue state!) primary, over 100K more ppl voted on the Repub ballot than on the Dem - even though Repub race was essentially over.
All the pundits this morning can't for the life of them figure out why Trump is campaigning in Michigan today &amp; Wisconsin tomorrow. #Brexit

Victory celebration on hold? No more end zone dance on the 2-yard line? Corks back in the bottle? He can still win. Let's get busy! 10 days!
Unless the emails show Hillary lit a forest fire, has been running Halliburton, or is responsible for the Galaxy 7, I don't give a rats' ass
All those female burglars, arsonists, hedge fund thieves, sexual predators, war profiteers. Not that women can't. They just usually don't.
No women ever invented an atomic bomb, built a smoke stack, initiated a Holocaust, melted the polar ice caps or organized a school shooting.
The day can't come soon enough when women will take charge. Public policy will not be decided by dick pix, Tic Tacs, grab-assers or the GOP.
Unbelievable that once again Hillary has to suffer the abuse of men &amp; their dickish behavior. Bubba, Weiner, Trump, Newt, Comey. Sick of it.
Backstage at Bill Maher - show starts in 2 min! We will shut this nonsense down!

Though Hillary's outspent Trump 3 to 1 on ads, Trump's in virtual tie w/ her in key swing states. Where's the bucket of cold water? #wakeup
Bloomberg poll this morning has Trump over Clinton in Florida. "Morning Joe" guests laugh cause Trump has spent "more on hats than polls."
Cost of Obamacare going up not the fault of Obamacare - it's because insurance companies are still in charge. This must end. Medicare 4 all.
Trump and Biden talking about having a fist fight - this is what it's come down to. Women in power can't come soon enough.

What it looks and feels like in the split seconds after you've just had the shit kicked out of you. By "a girl." #misogynistnightmare https://t.co/Jupe5fMhsK
"Such a nasty woman"? What he meant was, "Women, they're nasty!" Let's make sure he learns just how nasty women (&amp; men) can be with a ballot
Our mission clear, our commitment unwavering, our will relentless: Nothing short of a 50-state sweep, both houses of Congress Democratic.
Trump stunningly says he won't commit to accepting the results of the election--his subtle call for possible violence. America, silence him!
Trump is giving us the chance to not only vote FOR Hillary and AGAINST him, but to defeat misogyny, racism, and stupidity. #debate
The sexual predator mumbles under his dirty breath, "Such a nasty woman."
"Entitlements." That's the Fox News word for human rights like social security and Medicare.

With Trump's interruptions &amp; weird running commentary, it's like there's a candidate for President on the stage-- &amp; Mystery Science Theater.
"Putin's not my best friend" -- said Putin's puppet. #debate
33,000 guns deaths (murder, suicide, accidents) a year in the US. In 2012, Canada had 172 gun murders.
Trump brings up Chicago but doesn't mention the Cubs or Putin. #Debate
In her 1st 2 minutes Hillary says she'll appoint justices who'll stand up 2 the rich &amp; powerful, support gay rights, abortion rights etc Wow
Apologies to people of future times who unearth this debate. Most of us were good and decent and some of us were men. #debate

Between July &amp; today, in spite of all he's said &amp; done, Trump has cut Hillary's lead in half, now only a 4pt dif. R u tired of saying WTF? https://t.co/ruEDIo5vT0
Yes, some rumors may be true. I "might" be putting the finishing touches on an "October Surprise" for this election. Then again...
2046: "Mommy, when did the rape culture end?" "Well, it took awhile. But the beginning of the end was on this day: https://t.co/bO60KZPxY0 "
We knew 2016 might see the 1st-ever woman president. We had no idea it'd lead to misogyny &amp; rape culture facing  a MASSIVE public uprising.

Two days later and I still can't get over why a woman was forced to share a stage with a sexual predator psychopath and suffer his abuse.
Politicians claim to be "Christian" &amp; are anything but. Last night we witnessed a woman who practiced what she believes #HowWouldJesusDebate
Trump stalked &amp; intimidated her around the stage, nonstop lied about her 2 her face--&amp; she simply answered the questions the town hall asked
Trump called her the devil, said he'd jail her, brought w/ him women who say they slept w/ her husband--&amp; she still kept her grace &amp; cool.
The media keeps saying the debate was "ugly" and "mudslinging." Wrong. Only one candidate hurled hate and lies and scum. The other was kind.
Today is Thanksgiving Day in Canada, a day reserved for Canadians to give thanks that they are not us.
Trump's comment that Hillary's "heart is filled with hate" was one of his biggest lies. Say what u will, I think her heart is full of love.
Is anyone else depressed by this tonight. Trump is a sick fuck. I could use stronger language but won't.
Agree w/ Van Jones: Never has a candidate threatened to jail his opponent. This happens in dictatorships. Scariest man ever to run for WH.
The crash &amp; burn of Donald Trump didn't happen tonight. He didn't lose a single vote, maybe gained some. She again was the smart 1. And kind
Hillary is waiting...waiting...waiting... Soon we'll have this debate's Miss Universe moment. Go in for the kill...tick...tock...tick...tock
Is it just me? Why is he still standing there? Why?
Trump to Muslims: "If u see hatred going on, u must report it." Ok, I'm reporting it. You are the source of the hate, Trump.
Obamacare has done many good things -- and it's lining the pockets of the insurance companies. We need single-payer for everyone. #Canada
Hillary -- TRUMP IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU! #stalker
Quit calling him "Donald"! He doesn't deserve it. Fight back. He's the one who belongs in jail. Stop with the rehearsed lines. Be yourself!
Hillary -- too over-rehearsed! Be yourself. Be personal. Give it to him. This sounds too close to Dukakis' answer...
Hillary -- you must turn to Trump and address him directly. Shame him now.
Anderson got him to say he's never done those things. On the record. Teed up beautifully now.
You wouldn't shake that hand either.
With respect to Public Enemy, it's Trump's Fear of a Female Planet tonight. #ItTakesANationOfMillionsOfWomen
Trump is using them as human shields. The abuse of women by this nutter continues. Our nightmare will soon be over. Hillary, attack!
Let's make this election the moment when love replaced hate,the angry party went away &amp;we chose women 2 run the show https://t.co/diSSMezHid
A 9-yr old girl, listening intently at a Clinton rally in Akron, OH, holding a Hillary doll. Will she have to live in a misogynist world? https://t.co/gii88w096u
Here's the blog I just wrote about Trump, women, and how the Republicans must go: https://t.co/diSSMezHid
US has history of rewarding sexual assaulters. Arnold elected governor after many women exposed him grabbing them. Clarence Thomas put on SC
Not Over Til It's Over. Until he's defeated or quits, everyone in the game, no one siting it out, no end zone dance,no more sports metaphors
Yikes, ppl will think I did these things. I am glad 2 have warned ppl 2 take Trump seriously. This race never shoulda been this close. NOTIO
Still others are grateful for the way I kept flashing a little mirror in Donald's face during the 1st debate, causing him 2 lose his mind. https://t.co/GkI5nUmYxl
Others note it was the way I put a mic on him in 2005 and told him we weren't rolling sound yet. Then I sent in Billy Bush 2 act like a pimp https://t.co/0wwOFsdZlE
Went 2 Ohio county w/26,000 registered voters, 500 voted 4 Hillary in the primary. I went to talk 2 them. Will release online end of next wk https://t.co/7e1G0ZwaMB

Because I believe Trump never wanted the job in the 1st place, I wouldn't be surprised if he's relieved  this news has given him a way out. https://t.co/3U9DQz6gIr

I'm back home after a week in Ohio being among Trump voters &amp; trying to get them to consider the better world Hillary would bring them.
Well, this is it. Historians and anthropologists will declare this was the moment Trump was over, when Tic Tac turned on him. https://t.co/vTemQZjSpb
Republican Senators who've voted to deny women control over their own bodies &amp; to deny them equal pay are "appalled" at Trump. You are him.
These Repub Congressmen are shocked - SHOCKED! - at Trump's comments. Really? Where were they on Day 1 when he called Mexicans "rapIsts"?
Ha! Hypocrite Republican officials jumping off Trump ship. Their job has been to legalize misogyny &amp; sexism. Trump just verbalized it.
I know this isn't right, but what if tomorrow's debate began with Hillary walking out &amp; grabbing Trump by the nuts? On 2nd thought, eww.
It's the Tic Tacs. The preferred breath mint of sexual predators. If u hear the rattle of that little box, run.
Today is the last day to register to vote in Michigan and many other swing states. City &amp; county clerks offices are open. Register! Vote!
Hey - if you've been sent an email for your tix to my live Ohio shows, u must REPLY to CONFIRM - or your tix won't be valid (check ur spam!)

Less than 200 left before my Twitter goes over three million followers. Seems like there should be prizes or at least balloons for all of u
You do amazing work, but that one last night should be taught in schools. It was one of most powerful takedowns of Trump I've seen on TV. https://t.co/3gssJx6BUA
The most amazing open 2 a show I've ever seen. Last night's @Lawrence O'Donnell. A 19-min uncut uncensored soliloquy https://t.co/E9MujkQtKB

My favorite Hillary line: "He loves beauty contests...and hanging around them." Creepy! Not enough is said of her exquisite sense of humor.
Here's the Columbus Dispatch story on the Ohio theatre banning me from performing and filming my election show there https://t.co/1XaMSBOR9O
Bottom line: Did YOU do anything today 2 get Hillary elected? If not, she lost. If u spent today relieved &amp; smug about her victory, she lost
Correct. And 16 Repub candidates tried using facts 2 defeat Trump. That worked out well. So yes, Hillary nailed it. Feels like a win. But... https://t.co/0wbiMjcTmg
U r not alone. Millions want 2 take risk of seeing what that "reality" show would look like. 10s of millions. Ppl in Hillary bubble unaware. https://t.co/nZTFuswKBm
Hahaha. Yes, the crazy righties missed my 'Trump won' point. What Trump won was more undying love, &amp; that should drive fear into all of us. https://t.co/XioeuYhunX
I mean she did great, he was awful &amp; the people who love a dumb bully fell in love all over again. Ignore his rabid followers @ ur own peril https://t.co/peTtjcwKgb
Colbert is live: "Trump sounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine."
Pro-Hillary gloaters doing end-zone dance again when still on 50-yd line. U MUST get it in your head TRUMP IS GONNA WIN and act accordingly!
While they're trying 2 load Old Man Donald into his car,Hillary is now in Westbury at a debate watch event giving a rousing speech #stamina
James Carville: "Trump was awful." Of course he was. That's why he'll do well. His base is rabid &amp; energized. Hers is: "I'm voting 4 her."
If u just turn off the TV right now and do nothing, you've just elected Donald Trump. Do something! Plan what you're going to do tomorrow.
If u want a smart, responsible, compassionate President, she was standing there. If u want reality TV... well, which country do we live in?
It's over. Trump, the egoist, the racist, the narcissist, the liar, "won." We all lost. His numbers will go up. She told the truth. So what.
Nope. He stopped. Not tonight. But we know what he wants to say about "Hillary and her family...". It will happen.
He wants to say it... here it comes...
You mean she doesn't have a penis. Is this what you call your penis, Donald? "The Stamina?"
Five minutes left. I wish she would just go off on him. BOOM! Too much preparation, too much class. Oh well.
Trump: "I have a much better temperament than she does!" Now, it's a comedy show.
Trump is getting live fact-checked by Lester Holt! Finally! Trump SUPPORTED the war. #debatenight
Hillary doing better. Fellow Bernie voters -- admit it, there's nothing she's said we disagree with. In fact, she's adopted his positions!
Trump announces the National Order of Cops has endorsed him. No surprise there. Police of America - if this is who u want for Prez...
She was good on the birther business -- but didn't u want to see her go full throttle on him? I mean, just look at him and say "Shame on u."
Wow. The racist candidate brings up her saying "superpredator." That took some very white balls. #debatenight
"There shouldn't be a profit system in filling our prisons with young people." - Hillary #debatenight
For Donald Trump. The debate is 1/3 over. Still time for Hillary to take him down. #debatenight
It's playing EXTREMELY WELL. #debatenight
If you're watching this in your blue bubble u probably have no idea how this is playing in the living rooms &amp; kitchenettes of middle America
A highly-rated and POPULAR TV star is on TV right now next to a smart person who probably doesn't watch much TV.  #debatenight
Instead Hillary responds by plugging her book and website. Please, HRC, pull out the long knives. #debatenight
#debatenight. Ok, the XY creature is going to continue to interrupt her and slam her. Clinton has to crush this motherfucker or...
Hillary -- tell him your name isn't Bill (u don't have to defend Bill's mistakes - NAFTA) #debatenight
"Michigan" again. He wins Michigan, Ohio, Penn, Wisconsin, he wins the election. ##debatenight
#debatenight Trump has just promised to be "semi-exact." I'm semi not interested.
Trump keeps sniffling. Is he... SICK?! Or is he sad about something?
Trump has disappeared his make-up person who handles the orange.
Trump's 1st answer? He says the word "Mexico" in his 1st 20words-&amp; then he goes right at the "Brexit" voters in the rust belt. Says Michigan
In her first answer, Hillary goes after income inequality and that a corporation should be sharing its profits with its workers.
Trump is wondering why there's a woman on his stage.
Hillary's first words: "How are ya Donald?!" Hahahaha. I can answer that for him.
God help us. Here we go...
Finally, a person from the majority gender...
This is the moon landing, the Beatles on Ed Sullivan, the Berlin Wall coming down. Finally,
If you have little girls (or boys!), have them put their homework away and join u in the living room to watch this first ever occurrence.
Before this debate starts, there is NO way to overstate this massively historical moment: The 1st woman to take this stage in over 225 yrs.
Here's why I've been banned by a theater in Licking County, OH. They said I would "sway people's minds." Oooh scary! https://t.co/UhD86zMAAY

Finally, after spending months focusing on how 2 get Repubs 2 vote 4 her while her youth support vaporized, this: https://t.co/aMAFLvGWRg
In every poll and survey now, more young adults say they favor socialism over capitalism. There's no going back. Thank u Occupy Wall Street.
The following year Romney's "47% takers" comment did him in &amp; within 5 yrs a democratic socialist won the presidential primary in 22 states.
All over the US &amp; world, avg citizens rose up against corp greed, capitalism, the banks &amp; "the 1%." It permanently changed the conversation.
Occupy Wall St began 5 years ago today. It grew to hundreds of encampments and thousands of acts of civil disobedience in the months after.
Trump: Keep stating obvious facts: "There is climate change" "No Arabs in NJ cheered the Towers falling" "I'm in need of help. Pls help me."
If the media has ANY integrity, it'll refuse to cover Trump for a week as a response 2 him tricking them 2 go live w/ his  "press conf" 2day
Nothing short of a 50-state sweep &amp; repudiation will make up for the hate he has spewed  at Black, Hispanic and Muslim America. #Berlin1933
Never forget: Trump LED a racist lynch mob &amp; got 5 youths WRONGFULLY convicted in the CentralPark jogger case. They spent 6-13yrs in prison!
Trump spewed racial hate for yrs insisting Obama was an African but not an American. He ignited the fire of hate we will now have to put out

Well, pneumonia. That's serious. Campaign kept it hidden Fri/Sat/Sun. No wonder the crazies get traction. Dems are pros at losing elections.

Tim Kaine. Sigh. Trying to win votes from a middle that's no longer there. Shows old political thinking.  Trump picked VP to excite the base
Hillary, don't pick an old middle of the road white guy NRA member. That's what a politician would do. U need 2 motivate the base! Be bold!
Machen Amerika groß wieder!
Here we go. 109 days until Nov 8th. Each day, get ONE person to promise to vote. On Nov 7-8, CALL/TEXT every 1 of em https://t.co/GhGhPHG6GR
Tthe silver lining here is that he can read. And read well! His motor skills of seeing words on a screen &amp; then annunciating them is a plus.
With all due respect to the German people, this WOULD sound better in German.
(Struggling to remember the letters like he was ordering a sandwich) "L...G...B.......T.........Q...." Killing them in Orlando - "no good."
Trump hostage by the name of "Mike Pence" is trying to send us messages using Morse Code by blinking.
Medea Benjamin is a BADASS! Sign: "Build Bridges Not Walls." She did something today. If you didn't do something today, u helped elect Trump
"Americanism" is his new word. You will hear it now a million times.
So, if I understand this right, the Iranians didn't have the right 2 apprehend illegal aliens (ie, our troops who went in Iranian territory)
To paraphrase Molly Ivins, I think this speech read better in the original German.
First Republican ever to use the word "peace" in any speech. So I guess that means, war.
He just said he "humbly" accepts the nomination, so I guess that means he hasn't accepted it.
Here we go fellow citizens-Our Next President has taken the stage. Prove me wrong! Do something! I dare u 2 get off ur ass #SociopathInChief
What all sane Republicans are thinking right now: THE WRONG TRUMP IS RUNNING!

He's gone now. That was scary. Checking to see if what he said was stolen from anyone. #thethingthat atecleveland https://t.co/qEpRc54llb
Zardoz has just appeared on a big screen inside the convention hall!
May the audio-enhanced bang of Paul Ryan's gavel signal the end of the Republican Party as we know it. GOP-R.I.P.
Ryan has now come back on stage and changed his mind, declaring Donald "J" Trump the winner &amp; the Republican nominee for president. #doover
I think Paul Ryan just announced that "Donald DAY Trump" is the Republican nominee for President. So Donald J. Trump lost! Yay! #phew

Someone speaking now whose entire college was free &amp; whose parents never had to pay a doctor or hospital bill. Because she's from Slovenia.
Now they're saying"Hillary deserves to be in stripes." Really? Pastels maybe or autumn hues, but not stripes. Quit hating on what she wears!
Now somebody is saying Hillary "personally killed" someone. I did hear she shot someone in Reno once... #RNC2016
I turned on the TV, but Duck Dynasty was on C-SPAN for some reason. So I switched to CNN, but they had "Charles in Charge." Confusing.
Oh, sorry - wrong channel. That was The Bachelorette. Channel 70 is C-SPAN; channel 7 is ABC.
Wait - who's JoJo? Why is she in Cleveland? They're choosing Chase? Somebody help me.
In 10 minutes, it begins. The best summer series ever: "GOP, R.I.P." (Note: will require record-setting audience participation in November)

Thank you #BlackLivesMatter for all that stand for &amp; all that you do. Keep the protests going. Millions stand with you. @Blklivesmatter
When new Dallas police chief took over he cleaned house-fired 70 cops. Citizen complaints dropped 82%! Heartbreaking https://t.co/SODAYQXuLT
With black police chief and new policies/training, police abuse complaints in Dallas have dropped a whopping 82% since 2010. Thank u DPD.
Let's hope we use this moment. Racism ingrained in our system must be eradicated. African Americans live in fear of police - this must end.
We can also control police killing black men &amp; other citizens. We need a national standard of police training &amp; screening. Most cops r good.
There have always been people who've snapped, gone insane, committed horrors. We can't always control that. We can, though, control the guns
To be clear: 1 tragedy committed by a loner who snapped. The other 2 tragedies this wk were committed by taxpayer-funded agents of the state
An Army vet who served in Afghanistan is now determined to be the lone sniper who shot 2 civilians and 11 police officers killing 5 of them.
1 mass shooting/day in US. Police killed 1,134 Americans in 2015, 1/2 of them minorities. 123 police tragically killed. #guns #madness #race
So much doesn't make sense. Suspects arrested in a Mercedes? Only suspect arrested in area is a woman? Snipers so precise - ex-military?
It's the 3rd night in a row of police killing &amp; now being killed. Won't end. Serious leadership needed. Pres. Obama, leave Poland, come home
Eyewitness in Dallas said protesters were the ones who showed cops where the shooters were firing from: https://t.co/UlnFwA0j6C
Fox only network with reporter on ground. His interview with a young man named Jamal was incredible. About 10 min ago.

Minnesota cops probably regret SteveJobs ever stuck a video camera on a telephone. Or that Zuckerberg lets a nobody do live feed 2 the world
Minnesota cops probably regret none of the 5 bullets hit Castile's girlfriend or her 4-yr. old daughter. Now the whole world knows. #murder
Note to 4-year old black girls in America: Yes, police will shoot an innocent black man two feet in front of your eyes.
Open season by police on black men. 3/5 human still so ok to kill. Latest victim in Minn worked @ a Montessori school. Who'll b shot tonite?

FBI dir said Hillary was so unsophisticated tech-wise she didn't even have a computer in her State Dept. office. She did have an 8-track.
Where's the House hearing into Hillary's abuse of Flipboard, her misuse of Yelp, &amp; her obsession with the Zippo Lighter App? Demand answers!
One clip that media isn't replaying from last nite was him laughing @ them 4 letting him just phone in to their shows instead of showing up.

The premise of "BrainDead" is essentially "how the F did we end up with a Congress so friggin' insane, not to mention candidates like Trump?
Hey has anyone seen the new CBS smart comedy "BrainDead"? It's from Ridley Scott &amp;the incredible team who made "The Good Wife".Mon nite 10pm
Supreme Court just threw out Texas' right wing abortion law w/ a 5-3 vote. Blocking Obama's replacement for Scalia is sure working out well!

UK "Leave EU" leader Nigel Farage just shouted, "And we did this w/o firing a single bullet!" Uh, no. One of your fans shot dead a pro-EU MP
Brits continue their stupid spiral downward. Iraq War collaborator, privatized crappy trains, adopts US system of student debt, now Brexit.
Hail Trumptannia! Fear Wins Out In UK. Britain votes to "build a 'wall'" by leaving EU. Hatred of immigrants, xenophobia, nationalism reign.
Thank you C-SPAN for going rogue and broadcasting the sit-in on the floor of Congress. I hope the Republicans don't retaliate against you.
Dem members of Congress asking me to ask u, if u are in DC right now, head over 2 the East side of the Capitol bldg now to their rally @1pm.
Since the Congressional sit-in began only 26 hrs ago, an estimated 92 Americans have DIED due to gun violence- just since 11:25am yesterday!
The House takeover continues. Around 1pm, all the Dem members are going outside to talk to all citizens who are gathered. Be there if u can!
ONE MILLION PEOPLE have died from gun violence in the US since the night John Lennon was killed. 1,000,000+
A raw, spontaneous protest by politicians, many who rarely stick their necks out, clunky, chaotic &amp;using subversive social media to reach us
Hundreds of average Americans standing outside Capitol in support of the sit-in. Hundreds in the House balcony. Numbers growing. Join them!
Rep. John Conyers, Detroit, on the House floor: "In my 5 decades in Congress, I've never seen us come together like this." No one's leaving
Paul Ryan, ignoring protest, holds a vote on a bill to screw retirees. Dems continue chanting, singing. Ryan leaves, turns cameras off again
PANDEMONIUM!!!!!!
BREAKING: Get ready- the Republican cowards r heading back 2 the Capitol Bldg 2 attempt 2 retake the floor. Any minute now. Stay strong Dems
Watch live now on C-SPAN which has gone rogue after the Republicans have censored the coverage of this sit-in: https://t.co/HiqCpNHyfZ
The sit-in on the House floor is now entering its 11th hour! Please tweet your support for your Dem member of Congress.
Ppl are showing up right now @ the Capitol Bldg 2 support members inside holding a sit-in over gun control. If u live in DC area, join them!
It is time, Mr. President, to get in the car, drive up Pennsylvania Ave, walk into the House chamber, sit down on the floor &amp; make history.
Dems-- hang in there! If the sit-in lasts for days, so be it. Don't leave til the Republican cowards return to pass gun control bills.
Bernie has come over from the Senate to join the sit-in in the House to much applause. #NoBillNoBreak
Watch now the Facebook Live feed of the House of Reps sit in after Republicans pulled plug on C-SPAN  https://t.co/HiqCpNHyfZ
Lifelong buddy Dan Kildee, our Rep from Flint, sitting in w/ John Lewis &amp; Dems. "It's our proudest day" he texted me https://t.co/yKjoNnFI6i
Republicans r owned by the NRA. Between Trump &amp; their refusal 2 pass gun control laws, may we see the crash &amp; burn of this despicable party.
Republicans are prohibiting C-SPAN from turning its cameras on while the Dems speak in favor of bills that would require background checks.
The day the Democrats got some balls. The sit-in is now in its 4th hr on the floor of the House. Republicans pull the plug, but it continues
C-SPAN goes dark, then Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) gets out his smart phone &amp; broadcasts it via Twitter's Periscope which C-SPAN is now showing
Republicans have turned off the cameras in the House of Representatives so that public can't see gun control protest! Stunning.

Any member of Congress who hasn't announced support for a bill to ban all assault weapons by Friday should be removed from Congress.
Any guy who had shop class in high school can change a semi-automatic gun 2 fully automatic in 5min. 4 million "AR-15"/M-16 guns in US homes
Ammo used in AR-15/M-16 is banned by Geneva Convention. It enters the body, spins &amp; explodes. Show the crime scene photos &amp; the NRA is over.
Please stop calling the assault rifle used in Orlando&amp;Newtown the"AR-15". It is the M-16 weapon we used in Vietnam, modified 4 civilian use.

That last Trump tweet was NOT from this week. It's from March of 2015 - before he was running. At least he's consistent in his racism.
Politics aside, teared up listening to Hillary say her mom was born on the actual day Congress voted to give women the right to vote in 1919
A democratic socialist, in the United States of America, has 46% of the pledged delegates. Just pause for a moment &amp;feel the wonder of that.
