@Breeyonnuh22 Jail!? What I do ?
Be prepared to spend roughly $4,000 for a bare-bones trip to $18,100 for a surreal experience.
For those looking for the complete Super Bowl experience, On Location Experiences (the “official hospitality of the NFL”) is selling game day packages for $15,925 per person
On Friday, the cheapest ticket price for seats in the upper endzone section were selling on StubHub for $3,475 each.
Fans should expect to pay between $4,000 and $6,000 for a ticket this year,
Individual tickets to attend the Super Bowl in-person hit a record high last year, and this year’s game is shaping up to be no different. Last year, the average resale ticket price was $5,682, according to SeatGeek
More than a million people are expected to visit Atlanta for this year’s Super Bowl game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and related events.

✋🏻MYTH: Men shouldn't eat Soya because they produce man-boobs! . Soya contains zero estrogen and there's zero evidence for soy disrupting sexual development or reducing men's testosterone levels.
✋🏻MYTH: Soya isn't a good source of protein Soybeans are what's known as a complete protein, unlike most plant proteins it contains all essential amino acids we have to get from food because they can't be made by the body. A cup of cooked soybeans contains about 22g of protein,
🤷🏼‍♀️ARE SOYA FOODS BAD FOR YOU? . 🤓Soya is controversial, many people call it a wonderful 'superfood', others call it a hormone-disrupting poison. As with most things in nutrition, there are points on both sides but there are few myths I must dispell once and for all! .
