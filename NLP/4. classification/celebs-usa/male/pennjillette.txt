Turning the Penn &amp; Teller Theater into the Penn &amp; Teller Fool Us Theater!  We are shooting on the roof of the Rio tonight https://t.co/kflAEvgQJD
@80sMTVmemories @DTJB @ZZTop That was a wild boat ride. And yes, we all did hang out.
@amateurrun @MrTeller @DamnedJuggler @SweetMattyD We don't have a show NYE, but all the time around there. And there's always @thepiff and @MacKingShow .
@shademoriquenda @MrTeller You don't mean "Red Herring" do you? Or are you talking about a in magic term?
@AZTeacherGeek @MrTeller @CWPennandTeller I can't wait to see him on FU. I bet it won't be long!
@SierraNasa Thanks. So, nice to see you.
@JonTucker Wow, gaffer's tape!
@paulshearer3000 I'd love someone to ask me to . . . you know, someone with a magazine.
@FacelessFreebie @PuddlesPityP @CaesarsPalace I can't know anyone who is going to be on Fool Us, that would violate the idea of the show . . . but we could have him for a closer working with us, and we're thinking hard with him about that.
Backstage with ⁦@RealTocaRivera⁩ and ⁦@jason_mraz⁩    I like them! https://t.co/5uDbc9JYZs
@DaveSmolar @MrTeller @FoolUsTV Hey Lucy, Happy Birthday! (and a hug)
@MarissaChlebow1 Thanks so much. I'm less of a Denny's guy now, but sure.
@KeishaOfficer @MrTeller Yup, we're going to be on Scooby-Doo. I don't know when it airs, but we did it just like that.
@WeitGuy I've not seen that show, but he's a good guy.
@gspeex Yeah one of the ingredients is butter.
@RaffyGanimian Looks good but not funny.
@CharlieGers Go through the P&amp;T website.
@KernelBluegrass Thanks. I will still say it wrong. Sorry.
@davidkwong @MrTeller Thanks, man.
@jhuntington Wasn't it always horror?
@leverett_sr We have been a "question" many times on Jeopardy and we did a whole season of SNL.

Oh my goodness.  Tonight in the Penn &amp; Teller show we’re doing a brand new bit.  We’ll do it JUST tonight and then record it for P&amp;TFU in March.  It stars my daughter, Moxie.  I’m so nervous.  I know she’ll be great.  What about me?  Yup, tonight is “Moxie Voltara!”
@MoonUponAStick I don't know.

@Pderop I watched a little. Very funny
@MindsEyePhotos @Jonesjazz Thanks for the picture.
@zetsuboubrizzle @Jonesjazz I'm embarrassed to say now I mostly practice on stage. But, I play every night.
@shane50407957 Don't just watch videos, read books. They get deeper into your head and will make you more original. Read.
I’ve been playing bass in the Penn &amp; Teller pre-show with Jonesy for 17 years now.  It’s been so so slow, but I’ve gotten better. I’m not too good, but I’m better than I ever thought I’d be.  ⁦@Jonesjazz⁩

@svtmawesome Oh goodness. I must find one.
@wbeck4 Nope, I think it's funded some other way.
@ricjoh Oh, I bet he's amazing. I'll look for it. When I finish his Moby Dick for the second time.
@ProperSWoman Yes, there might be a "goddamn" or two and a little blood, but 8 should be fine.
@Davidowen64 I'm probably not the person to ask. They will not allow us in the Magic Circle, even though we are in their museum and have written for their magazine. We aren't allowed in.
@michaelkent @MaknWinks @ErikTait @MrTeller Wow, that is really great. What a wonderful tone and real no-kidding tricks. And really uses the props. Thanks for working on that. Did you see our "Vampire Ball &amp; Vase?" We did it on FU. But great work. Thanks.
@ErinMShaw @PennSunday I knew Andy a little. I think he would have liked it, but I kind of don't. But I think he would have.

@HackersCurator I talk about Hackers all the time. I loved doing that.
@timaniko @RioVegas @MrTeller I'm so sorry. I sure hope you try again and we get him on stage. Sorry.
@JackieFiest You can go through the P&amp;T website, but I can tell you I know nothing.
@JayMcGee68 @FreeRangeKids @MarkDavis @MrTeller The Free Range Kids ideas are so important and that makes me feel great.
@EricIdle @TaniaIdle I like you, Eric. I like you more because you like us, but I'd still like you if you didn't. So there.

@Muunrakur @MrTeller I'm sorry. We're leaving for FLA, so that show has been not on the books for months. Sorry.
@FrodoDhobbit Read my book "Presto." Everything I know is in there. It also comes up on https://t.co/XO3gxvB5yC. Or . . .just go to just whole plants once a day.
@amateurrun @MrTeller Now we're doing a bit about two person codes for fake psychic stuff, so I make a lot of eye contact. Other than that, it's the opening, Street Magic, and Wizard, but not really to interact.
@CCannabrava Thanks so much. I have no idea what my schedule is.
@WendyBirdOZ @MrTeller @shecky71 Thanks for letting us know, I passed it on to the powers that be.
@Ed_Cunard Okay, I bought the book. When will I have time to read it?
@urbanflowerpot @PhilBot7 Nicely done and welcome back. A couple times you stop without missing. You stop because you THINK you're going to miss. Don't do that. Fail!
@Jimmy_Poodle Oh poor baby. That must have happened to him more than we'd like to think.
@tminus5 @PennSunday @adamconover @AdamRuins I don't know him, never met him, no contact. I'd love to have him on, but have no connection.
@Brian4photo I'm so sorry to hear that.
@akeywithin We sure have been happy with the name Moxie!
@SirOwenDisney @MrTeller @hardrockliveorl We'll be there, it's much harder to do together, but we'll be there separately.
@lunapetunia8 OH my goodness. It sure is. I've lost all of your weight.
Okay that bit has been in for 2 shows and no one got hurt is we are putting in another new bit tonight.  We are just stupid.
@david_ducharme Oh, we have changes and mistakes on everything, but I don't know as we have a full simple reversal. Diet is probably the closest.
@DonkeyMiles @MrTeller Oh dear. I'm just not qualified.
@JonSEM @PennSunday Ask Reddi Rich at the WebSite. He'll know.
@Paigie_L @MrTeller Very nicely done. I am so flattered.
Watch my buddy, Pete, he does a good show! https://t.co/cC8WJWKwZr
@drmatt We knew them too, you assume right.
@InvaderPet No magicians were upset, it's a silly bush-league show. No real secrets. But for hype they pretended people were upset. Just sales. My children liked parts of that show.
@NeilR24 Happy birthday, Claire!!!!
@Colin5foot5 I wouldn't be the one to ask. There's probably some cultural thing, but it's being fixed. Won't be true in 5 years.
Guess what?  You’re right ANOTHER brand new big going into the live show tonight. We decided it was time to give away how two person “psychic” acts do their miracle.  That goes in tonight.
I saw @SaySomethingBunny last night.  Alison S.M. Kobayash has invented a whole new form. I can’t remember seeing a live performance I liked more. It’s real no-kidding time travel.  If there’s anyway you can see it — do it. https://t.co/BI7r32KlgC
The reason I got to go to the set of @SHO_Billions was that I’m buddies with @BrianKoppleman  It’s always fun to see him and even more fun to see him at Axe Cap. https://t.co/eQTOWDO2DM
Stopped into the set of @SHO_Billions.  Yup, that’s me at Axe Cap, where I belong https://t.co/tq0FVTvl47
@Skattered_Ink No plans for Australia, but we'd love to.
@snavEwerdnA @MrTeller @naked_ravens @RioVegas I don't understand. We have wheelchair seating. I hope she gets to see us.
@amateurrun @PennSunday If you write to the website, they can give you an address. Thanks. I'm reading the bird genius book now and I'm loving it.
@DonnaAsbur @MrTeller We work really hard to make every seat in the house good. When I go to a show, I love the front row. I want all I can get, but you have to decide for yourself.
@irishjig13 Make sure it's a venue that lets children in. We always welcome children, but sometimes the venue doesn't. I have no idea about passcodes, sorry.
@2000Jschn Thanks, baby.
@MattRad Nope, the learning curve is clearly a graph and there's not way that becomes "hard."

@CurtisHamilton8 @MrTeller I'm glad you're feeling better, baby. We're always trying to do another Bullshit, but someone has to hire us to.
@carbonaro Thanks man, yeah, I said that the S&amp;R show had blue-eyed mutants, and also tigers.
@Barack_McBush I'm still pretty proud of the stuff we've done throughout our career. I would like it.
@KentJCollins @MrTeller @ActorsEquity I think first time we were AGVA, I'm not sure about last time. Our stage manager is union.
@M3SSN3R I gotta do more thinking and reading about this. You don't understand my point, because I don't understand it. But when I have a point, I'll try to be clear.

It was 26 years ago today that we first played Vegas.  Bally’s Celebrity Room.  It felt like a big deal and I guess it was.
@M3SSN3R Clear your cookies, baby.
@amateurrun I like the Withings watch way better because it's always on, and it does heart and sleep all the time and you don't have to charge it much. I use the top of the line but forgot the name. I love it.
@HopskipAlex Yes, I watched a lot of "The Americans" and I liked it a lot . . .but "Patriot," as you saw, is a whole other level!
@spalmermarshall @RioVegas @MrTeller Wow. I'm so glad Jay had that. Yeah, we had an odd way of describing ourselves. It still feels right.
@doramu @Filmdanceplay @WithingsEN @CES @B987SLC @PennSunday Wouldn't it be nice if that were always true?
@GMcFerren @wyclef Oh, I love you. How kind. Thanks.

@HeyMarlana Yeah, I'm on Goodreads and I keep every book I'm reading up there and make my highlights public, but I don't care about the author stuff.
@Shierkahn I don't know. I would think it would be best to go to one meal and just vegetables, no fruit or nuts.
@DagnyTaggart78 @egabbert I find them all sorts of places. I have friends, and I also read the Books section of the Times. The reviews are often snarky and pompous, but I feel I can tell what I will like even through that.

The Word Pretty by @EGabbert  Wow.  I haven’t felt this way about a book since first reading Nicholson Baker.  On my list with Mezzanine, Eunoia, &amp; Moby Dick.  If she were writing this she’d have smarter stuff to say than “great,” but this is me. Read it!  https://t.co/2XxwR0Q5tL

Our run at the Rio is old enough to vote. We have been running in the Penn &amp; Teller Theater full time for 18 years!  (We did a few months here and there before that). We love it.  Thank you all.
@classicalbone Mission accomplished!
@tylernisbet Oh dear I don't know that song. I guess I stopped listening. Sorry.
@adamfelber You sure did, and then invite her over to do the same for me.
@markwooster As you can imagine, it depends entirely on the trick. Some we can throw right back in just by saying we're going to. Some, like Double Bullet . . .well, that'll take a few hours.
@iamotto31 I'll look for you dancing like that next time.
@BrianStrenko @ThatKevinSmith @RayCronise 30 pounds is amazing and I bet you feel great. Do not worry about my numbers.

@ForbesSuzan @tim_cook I regret not taking a selfie with you.
@InquisitiveSide @MrTeller I'm sorry I wasn't clearer in my writing. I wasn't bothered even the slightest amount. That wasn't supposed to be a deep fooler and even if it was, it wouldn't bother me. You made me laugh a lot with "thin skin." Sorry, I wasn't clearer, I was happy with your tweet.
@mikebentle @RioVegas @MrTeller Never played Flamingo. Most likely it was Bally's.
@SebastianBu Numbering things like that are hard. We worked on it a long time and some ideas were pretty good and we're proud of them.

@ricjoh @mseiler1 @MrTeller Thanks for the proper pronunciation. His reading of Moby Dick is so far and away the greatest. I'll listen to more of him.
@circsmonky Nope, I never read it. I couldn't even get through "Art of the Deal."
@CrankMagoo I've never liked paper. I like having a bunch of books available, and the ability to look up words and highlight and take notes easily. Not just iPad, I read iPhone and Kindle too. Mostly Kindle for reading books. iPad for news.
@vivanate Hey, I just do it as an excuse to eat cookies, but if it helped you, I guess that's okay too. Hang in there, baby.
@LordLicorice I used to be just double and now it just single. So I can read my Kindle.

@DavidYoung What a hard question. So hard. Biggest surprise? I guess being alive. Still, or at all.
@markcpoe You do know there's a limit to characters here, right? And to the time I have. YES, and I can't list them because they are too numerous. How about everything I'm not doing publicly?
@docmagik @MrTeller That's great. We gotta know where to stand!
@RoboSkel100K @FoolUsTV That should be our FU trophy. Damn. Someone beat us to it.
@RubyRedTootsies @MrTeller I hadn't seen that. Really funny.
@Coach_Seibert @MrTeller Thanks. Hope to see them on FU as a team in a few years.
@gratitudechang1 @MrTeller @thepiff Sure, I started upright bebop bass at 45. But, one trick is tough. Get "The Royal Road to Card Magic" and work through it. You'll get good.

@GeoffDale6 Shemp, like all of them, was a pro. I love how seasoned and skilled. So much stage experience, and Shemp had the most.
ANOTHER 3 new bits goings in tonight.  It’s a mostly different show from a month ago.  This is so stupid.  So scary.  So so fun!
@sooger @MrTeller Congrats!!! 20 years. Nice going!
@StefanSwanlund We didn't have our children believe in any of that, but I don't know if it's the teacher's place to do that. It seems like no big deal either way, but probably better to leave that to families.
@Deborahlyon13 @AmandaHilden Hey, @AmandaHilden HBB -- Happy Birthday, Baby.
@Muunrakur @teller I'm sorry, I don't know him. I'll keep an eye out. And thanks.
@mnewington @RayCronise @ThatKevinSmith @tom_watson Gabba gabba we accept you! Congrats!
@paxo666 @ThatKevinSmith @RayCronise Gabba gabba we accept you.
@KevinSavetz I love my Sun Ra, but I probably won't get up there. Drag.
@TheRealJDanielC Gabba gabba we accept you! That's so great. Thanks so much for letting me know and giving me some credit when all belongs to you.
@KnobbeQuinn Thanks. We miss you.
@OfftheStrip @Metallica @JimBreuer Thanks. It's a nice little trck. And a very rocking concert.
@Reducetarian For any appearance thang, please go through our P&amp;T website, but it looks like an important idea.
@SteveDickerNL @CWPennandTeller @MrTeller It'll sure fool my ass.
@GeoffDale6 I love Shemp, the most underrated Stooge. Please go through the P&amp;T website for an interview.
@HDSlim103 Magic still wins, but people ask me about the weight loss pretty often.
@JimBreuer The pleasure, Jim, was mine.

@Delc17 I'm sorry I don't know about the music. It's often different music for the acts when we see it live.
@bbqdbrains I didn't know Ricky very well. Probably a total of a couple hours, but he was so wonderful and I loved his shows. And he was on TV with the Sex Pistols!
Oh man, Ricky Jay.  Just a genius. One of the best who ever lived. We’ll all miss you, Ricky.  Oh man.
@mikehil47588407 @chrshgn I'm sorry, I meant no insult to anyone (on this subject) - my children eat meat. It was just sloppy writing in a volatile medium. Sorry.
@JimB_85 That's a much more complicated question than you can or should know. But, yes, I'm thinking about it a lot. A way lot.
@Pderop I haven't read it yet, but I love him.
Hey, there’s a few people you have to buy something for on Black Friday.  Give them art, by my buddy, Tony Fitzpatrick @ThisTrain - he’s got your black Friday hanging!  https://t.co/E9doatipfT  ONLY 50 BUCKS!

Happy thanksgiving y’all.   This will be my first one that’s cruelty free.  Not just vegan for health anymore. (this is not a holiday of healthful eating anyways)
@dlgdyer I've put a lot of pictures of donating on this Twitter feed. Go ahead, cop them. Or write to our office on P&amp;T website.
@svtmawesome Oh baby, I sure hope it's a lot. So many. I want a lot.
@CT_Mailman I just don't remember. I think it was about some music I did with Steven Banks.
@Lachessys I really don't know. Others are working on it. Certainly not in the form that I was thinking abut.
@danicamckellar It was a really great crowd last night, thanks for being part of it.
@WalkerLucas @SweetMattyD @DamnedJuggler It certainly is not. We force that card.
@SaraKirkpatrick @MrTeller I miss Ward so much. That's a hunk of America that's gone.
@LeiAndLove I think watching it once was enough. But, I loved it.
@gspeex @HeyScoops Thanks, I know I love my Tiny!
“Patriot” on amazon prime is the best show of any kind there has ever been!
@Davidowen64 That seems a lot better, don't you think?
@colin_krieger @drjasonfung @RayCronise @ThatKevinSmith @richroll @garyvee @PeterAttiaMD Gabba gabba we accept you.
@Deborahlyon13 Gabba gabba, we accept you!
@Ben22Doshin @MrTeller It will be in the act soon -- you are a genius.
@Davidowen64 That's a nice packet trick. Although it does seem you need to show the other side.
@LilSallyScoop @PennSunday Thank you so much. I do like the scream. The whole Sunday School should be just me screaming.

Another new bit going in tonight.  We are crazy.  A new opener.  Actually just a total rework of an old idea.   Hope it’s okay
@NJWaterGuy @MrTeller Yes, it's all fine for a sophisticated 8 year old.
@LisaSteiner_PTX @PStroud10 @PTXofficial It's their xmas show, not ours.
@PStroud10 @PTXofficial Oh yeah, it's gonna be on TV.
@czingaman Thanks so much, baby.
@SerenaAnnabel17 I'm sorry, I don't remember which act you're talking about.

@BobRozanski @mattgoss Gabba gabba we accept you.
@ThatNeilGuy Needless to say I have a copy of that magazine.
@jordanlaubaugh Yes, Grand Luxe. Thanks. Roast beef, I think. Back in those days when I ate stuff that seems creepy now.
@PeteStevens We don't have any recordings of our live show.

@ItsMeDanaLee Thanks, baby.  So glad you like it.
@proorganizing Nope, Pete is fine, you’d be praying for me to get the message.
@NNY1980 @MrTeller We do the UK every couple of years, but no other plans right now.  Come to Vegas.
@jhuntington I checked out a little.  I love a Ramone in anything.
@AlSultan_Meriam If you want to be on FU, you cannot let me know.  Go through the producers and leave me out of it.  It wouldn’t be fair for me to know.  We record the beginning of March.
Okay, the new bits?   Well, 2 out of 3.  Teller’s solo bit KILLED, just perfect.  The bit together was really good.  My solo bit . . .the prop broke in my hand.  That’s life in the food chain.  Try again tonight.  Oh boy.
@gil_brice Oh dear. It's so complicated. It has to do with what's been seen most, what we're having the most fun with, and then tone and balance in terms of the two of us and kind of magic and level of comedy etc. etc.
@jacqui702 I guess I can retweet, but I don't know anything about it.
@JeffreyKrasner @PlateletBioGen I don't know anything about medicine, I'm just giving them my arm to drain. But you can find me at the P&amp;T website..
@nolackofluster I'm reading a book on learning Arabic, a book on Buddhism, a few books of poetry, a book about Hubert's Museum and "All the Light we Cannot See." Yes, I've read that Lenny book. (I'm on Goodreads.)
@weelula Meditation is being mindful. Feeling my arm and the tingling from the anticoagulant seemed perfect.
@slotvideos Congrats! We will take it in cash after the show when you see us in Vegas (or anywhere on the road!) Congrats!
@disgruntmonkey Well, it sure looks like my lizard hanging there.
@ruskhat @ChrisHerndonArt I wasn't told about a revival for any reason.
@StabeFloyd I'm listening now!
@proorganizing You can pray for Pete and back up with the P&amp;T website.
Tonight - THREE totally new bits go into the P&amp;T show.  Totally.  Never seen anywhere.  And then by the end of the month — 4 more.  And by the end of the year, pretty much all new.  Getting ready for FU19.

@shauntopolis Peanut butter. It's about the only food craving I have left, and that's a nice wad.
@MSKhimself @theResidents Yeah, I really should talk about H. I'm so sad he's gone..
@SandtheB @MrTeller He worked a non-showbiz job (AT&amp;T), and then retired recently. I think he does a lot of church music. He's done well.
@MattEricksonLA Gabba Gabba We Accept You.
@fourth_shift @MrTeller @HartmanMusicNY Gabba Gabba we accept you.
@NSebree Nice. I love Bob.

@gordonfree I've done over 1000 days in a row of Headspace and I like that. I've added Sam Harris "Waking Up" and it's deeper and more intellectual. I like both.
@MSPinnock @MrTeller We'll get the trophy ready!
@nathanriches It just keeps getting better. Dig it!
@meuserj I guess I wasn't clear. My not voting for Trump was also not voting for his nominees. It's the only vote I'm given on this choice. That's all. But you are right.
@WendyBirdOZ @MrTeller That must have been it, right?
@MissBinks @MrTeller I'm so so sorry, but I'm afraid it's true. We had to cancel that show. I'm sorry.
Here you go!  Amazing Randi, Johnny Thompson, @Jonesjazz all in the Monkey Room backstage. https://t.co/MNtzFsrLh6
@kontaktm @MrTeller It's a question that makes no difference to me. I just like 'em.
@Pderop Yeah, man, we love Tom Mullica and miss him so so much. So much.
@themuna @RayCronise @ThatKevinSmith I don't really know. You just don't want to be building muscle is the way I understand it.
@dgriessmann @MrTeller Yeah, it wasn't a good bit, but it sure is an amazing prop.

@snave_nerak @MrTeller @foolus No plans to shoot there, but I think it will be shown there.
@TheSet_UpMan Yup, that has to happen, but records that good don't come quick.
@kristianleth @MrTeller That means the world to us. Thanks so much for taking time to tell us.
It was 20 years ago right now that I first started to learn upright bass so I could be straight man and sing, and play with Tommy Smothers
@Johannes_Avatar This is it: https://t.co/vWxSAylXX5 Great.
@jose_aleman Me too, I love that hymn.
@WendyBirdOZ Remind me today.
@kontaktm @MrTeller Why bother? I think you've got all of showbiz right there.
@IamYebor We have put a lot of them up as past shows. I think they are labeled pretty well and you can find them.

@chriswaynemagic It was the close of our show for years. In the 90's. We were the first full frontal male nude on a Vegas Strip stage. It was never done on tv.
@docmagik @SweetMattyD @DamnedJuggler It's pretty much a slightly more strict nutritarian. For the time I was losing, no nuts or fruit and then back after target. Whole plants other than that.
I just did my 1000th day in a row of Headspace meditation. 1000!   It was good. I will keep meditations but I might change to or add in Waking Up meditation with Sam Harris.  He got me started
@lagranderusty I've heard a little, but I have to really sit down with it and enjoy it.
@abefroman_sk That's a great cartoon. And I have my turntable set up and never use it.
@garethgreenaway @MrTeller Shhhhhh!
Some of my friends brag that their children like Zeppelin and watch Warner’s cartoons.  I’m proud that my children get me to watch “don’t hug me I’m scared” and “adventureTime”. So much better
@tracievsmith @Kwongerific @MrTeller Thanks so much. That is so important to me. I want people to notice that we like the people we have on.
@Kwongerific @MrTeller I love that children like our show. We did TV just for adults for so long. Thanks.
@Wolfman50020 @longshotauthor @MrTeller I'm sorry, I have no knowledge at all. Never heard of it. So sorry.
@TheFuFighters Nope. They answer two different questions. "Agnostic" is "Can it be known?" and "Atheist" is "Do you personally, right now, actively believe?" Epistemology v. theology. Most atheists are both.
@Toyotajeff1 Any requests for interviews have to go through our P&amp;T website, it's not my job. But thanks for thinking of me.
@aussiesloth70 @MrTeller They have vegan, so when I'm there, I'm there! I don't care what size I am.

@urbanflowerpot You're doing great. Start your first throw more toward the center, and trust gravity, don't go up to them, let them come to you. Relax and let them fall. Without gravity, juggling would be very different. It's your friend.
@firstwheat @Deborahlyon13 @MrTeller Yes, I don't trust anyone's memories, not even mine. Ever.
@MikeBasso1 It's humble and visible.
@ThatElJefe But it's not made of piss like the real thing.
@TESDuk @ThatKevinSmith Gabba gabba we accept you
@jasonlung I say jump in with Third R&amp;R and Commercial.
@Deborahlyon13 @MrTeller All good magicians feel guilty. . .but remember, you aren't lying to them at all. . . they know it's a "trick," so they are in on it. People don't need to know every chord a guitarist plays, and some are easy.
@DJRicoche I did it at home with my buddy, Dr. Michael Klaper, stopping by every day to check on me.
@warwickp I gotta tell you, I loved that child and their bow tie, and a GREAT joke.

@sugarrushdsocio Yeah, I might have been the first to say that, but only because I was the first attacked, by someone who should have so much better to do.
@mealzjhunter @MrTeller Wow. That's so kind of you to say. I'm really so flattered. You are too kind. Wow. What can I say? Thanks.
@Scuba_Beck @MrTeller Oh Edison, we are so flattered to be there, but . . .oh Edison Oh dear. Well, we hope to see you in Vegas. Clarinet and recorder are good choices, easier to carry than a bass.
@RnR_clown78 I've sent it to Rich. I hope he'll find this tweet and let you know what he thinks.

@connorratliff I remember that night on Broadway with Elvis. So much fun, and some people not even knowing it was all set up and scripted. Great.
@ConDemd @MrTeller Thanks. I remember you saying that. What are you talking about? We're doing a big Master Class to accomplish just that.

@elenor_smites I used to get headaches all the time, but on the vegan, low salt and fat diet. . . nope, I feel great even at 24 hours.
Soon I might need someone who can translate one sentence into Arabic for me and then teach me to pronounce it.  If you wanna - please let me know.  I don’t think you need to be in Vegas

We’re putting in a brand new bit tonight: Yeah, it’s the Linking Rings.  Yup, we’re doing it. Yup.  You got a problem with that?  You wait.
@rocketj234 @ChipSeiferlien @MichaelWmGordon @TerencePlizga @hLarranaga @RobertSense   We shoot the show out of order (all cards on one day, all animals, all big acts. . .) so for editing Alison wears the same clothes . . .and so do we!!!!
@Dannicoloff I didn't have a favorite trick growing up, I had favorite bands. I didn't care about magic.
@katiehersh @ThatKevinSmith Gabba Gabba we accept you
@Soon2B4mrFatGuy @ThatKevinSmith Gabba Gabba we accept you.

@darkwing000032 Thanks so much. There's plenty of anger.
@JonahFalcon @MassiveDMG_ @IAMRayPark Yup, that's Tod Browning's, but I throw in a little Ramones. Thanks for noticing.
@agoins84 The name seems familiar, but that's all. Sorry.
@The___Emperor Wow, I have no advice on what to read. I've been doing public speaking since I was a child, so I didn't really study it. Best of luck.
@VoodooChilly @PennSunday @HeyScoops I need a friend named "Ducky"

@jmixont @MrTeller Thanks, baby.
@ElphieWitch @MrTeller @RoarForJess Hello, @RoarForJess, you bet your ass we're roaring for you, my friend!
@GalaxyGirl9 I didn't tell Teller, I was too busy being jealous.
@SierraNasa It was great to meet you.
Yup! That's me in my Asparagus Valley Cultural Society T-shirt and circus arts haircut! https://t.co/x0Ee4jvcaU
@RobLangAus @PennSunday American Pie came out at exactly the time when I really really really analyzed silly lyrics. So, if I do that, it'll be hours.
43 years ago Teller and I did our 1st show together at the Minn. Ren. Fest. And last night, we were back at the Rio and happier than ever!
@winchester75 @EmilyJillette @AdamRifkin @MakePennBad Thank you for making a movie with us.

@Nikki_Shannon They usually run over during the commercial and tell us. A couple didn't, but those were friends being dicks.
@ManickMeeple Yeah, we should be doing those updates. Sorry. We'll do them.
@theAaronCameron I didn't track calories, I just ate very low calorie food, but the weight loss of .9 pounds a day, says I was probably eating below 1000 calories a day.
@melissacynova @goodreads I wish you were hanging in Vegas eating potatoes. It's fun.
@RyerAppeldoorn I do miss my turtles. I used to read to them.
@ktots_22 David is a friend and a great magician. He invented "Street Magic" where everyone else sucks and I've heard nothing but great about his last tour.
@debpuchalla Thanks. I love talking to Koppelman, he's the best.
@Salvius23 @missipyle @MakePennBad @AdamRifkin @EmilyJillette The difference between funny and creepy/weird is lost on me. Aren't they the same?
@RyerAppeldoorn Oh, it doesn't take much for me to love a fountain, but originality does seem to count. But, I love them all.
@varkirchik @seanseaevans Sure, have him invite me. I'll eat as long as it's vegan.
@iamhoneydill @MrTeller Good idea, we're on board if someone wants to do it! Nice art!
@CodyCitro @TheTubaDad @HorrorNightsORL @Michael_Aiello We have no plans now, but we loved doing the horror house and hope to do another. We love the Universal people.

@feeman I guess that must have been contractual. Maybe I have good agents?
@movieloverjohn @MrTeller I don’t really know schedule, that’s on our website. Sorry.
@point51 Sure. It’s a complicated game and there are been some confusing cases, but everyone understands.
@endosepsis Gabba gabba we accept you.
@michelecaula We were wrong about a lot on Bullshit and we’ve changed on a lot. That’s what time does.  We are different people now, so it would be a different show.
@jhooton2 I LOVE Tom Waits as a writer/actor/performer and a friend. He’s the best.
@ManofStats Controlled puking is a “Human Ostrich” act and people earn a living. Stevie Starr does some of that. I don’t need to see you do it.

Fast over! 14 days, 7 minutes - Kidneys needed a break. Off all meds/down over 22 pounds. Eating watermelon chunks now - “Chunks is my dog!”
@trickdick I’m not doing it for the cancer claims. I just don’t know. Haven’t done any research.
@lagranderusty Yeah, the softball thing was a curve. The closest I’ve come to a sport in years.
Still not too social, but I’m reading here. Fast is lucky 13 days - BP and weight great. I’m slogging through. Thanks for all the support.
@FlexibleEthics Yeah, I’ve seen that clock. Beautiful. I’m still working on mine, “Big Penn.”

@Xcrawl Wow. Is this your first?  Is it fun?
@reedyp I want to think.
It's day 0 of my weird atheist skeptic medical vision quest.  I'm going to start a water-only fast tomorrow. I'm also going to fast from all social media and news.  I need time to think.  Things will still be retweeted and get to me, but after today I'll be gone until August.
@SodaStreamUSA It's not the last two.
@SodaStreamUSA I have one machine that freezes up and puts fewer bubbles in.  I wonder why one does that?
@SurlyByDefault Yup, that's me.
@RussellSauve @MrTeller Wow.  So great.
@SodaStreamUSA @coachkeithallen @PennGillette I'm the one who spells it wrong, don't worry.

It was 18 years ago today that I stated taking upright bass lessons and learning about jazz.  I'm not great, but I'm better than I thought I'd ever be.
@botherer Thank you.  I am very protective of how people are treated on our show.  And I don't like people attacking and insulting them and giving away stuff they wouldn't like tipped.  So thanks so much for understanding and stopping.
@botherer You are so deeply wrong.  You are trying to sound smart by pretending that meanness is bravery and then bragging on yourself.  You know, I don't think you want me to be critical of people.   I'm about to start being that way with you.  Now shut the fuck up.
@RadelaideAces Gabba Gabba we accept you.
@botherer We do not lie. It takes a great deal of fucking balls to get up there.  I'm not going to piss on them.  I tell the truth.  When we know how something is done, we say so.
@iresignedshow Thanks.  Please go through our office through our website.  This isn't my job.
@botherer I don't believe in constructive criticism.  Be kind.
@botherer We are always honest on the show.  We don't know every trick.  And performances of things we've seen often please us.  We may be stupid, but not lying.
@madebynomo @BourbonBullfrog It was never our goal.  We exceeded all our goals.  We're in free fall.

Oh, the time is for Teller to heal completely, I won't be on a water-only fast for the full 5 weeks, of course. Medically supervised and just long enough to give some help to my blood pressure.  Not for weight.
@GlimmerODope YEs.
Yes, we will NOT being doing our show from July 10 - August 18th.  Teller needs back surgery and I'll be doing a medically supervised water-only fast.  We'll be back super-healthy! Sorry for changing anyone's plans.

BTW -- "water fast" does NOT mean fasting FROM water, it means taking in ONLY water, and plenty.
@SkeptPsychology @michaelpollan @SamHarrisOrg Sorry, that terms means ONLY water, not fasting from water.  Sorry that wasn't clear.
Has anyone written smart stuff about atheist/spiritual brain changes during extended medically supervised water fasts? Kinda like @MichaelPollan / @SamHarrisOrg without LSD and without food?
@chip89 Yup, I read that article . . .which is why I mentioned it . . .but there are still controversy and so many are dead now.

@Deborahlyon13 @this_iss_Taylor It was not a smart show.
@OneOfTheWills @WendyBirdOZ @MrTeller @SweetMattyD Yes
@croakthedj Nice
@FiascoJenkins We were paid nothing
@DuckJones1 @jptech360 @VitalVegas @MrTeller @LasVegasLocally Thanks baby.  There's your response.
@jptech360 @VitalVegas @MrTeller @LasVegasLocally Oh, you certainly meant offense, but I don't care.  And go see Carrot Top again. I'd rather have people come that love our show.  Thanks for your time.
@jptech360 @VitalVegas @MrTeller @LasVegasLocally I sent the tweet to Carrot top.  Thanks.
@jptech360 @VitalVegas @MrTeller @LasVegasLocally I will tell him you said so. He will be thrilled.
Penn &amp; Teller are still vital Vegas performers - Las Vegas Sun News — thanks, this is very kind. https://t.co/vcoipqnXVv
@MarkBal93 Thank you.  It does amaze me that the word "cameo" has changed so, but I guess it has.
@BrowncoatBob Thanks so much.  Glad you liked it.
@this_iss_Taylor @MrTeller It was a drag they didn’t give away anything real and he was so terrible.  But funny and camp
@IvanMold I can't imagine I did.  It seems like an easy thing to think of.
@baughmanii @RiverwindCasino @MrTeller Nope sorry.  Not on the road.  Too hard to get a good piano and a place to put it on stage

@sebastray everything is practice.  Just practice.   That's everything.  Do it.
@chip89 Tea.  Nothing with any sugar or milk or anything.  Seltzer is what I drink.
@effinglibrarian @MWDanvers Not cheer -- polite applause.
@PaulMcElligott We have so so much more in common.  All of us.
@bonedvm I try to make it good
@JoeJamesPop I havne't.  I want to.
@TristanTom too much salt and sugar and oil.
I have no idea when this is from.  Sometime in 90’s right?  @realgilbert and us! https://t.co/aNZSFPj54i
@MarkBal93 Sure.  I like Face Off too.
@freerangemink Yes, and I wrote most of what they said.  So there.
@LaurieFaen Yup, I know him and have stayed with him.
@ryan_boyle45 @ThompsonWolfman @nutrition_facts @RayCronise @DrFuhrman those are old pictures.  That's only the first few months I looked like that.  But, if that's the excuse you need . . .
@rob_dukes I will listen soon. I remember
@gaeaxoxo Yes
I'm off to LA tonight for the WGA screening of "Director's Cut" with the Q&amp;A after.  Tomorrow afternoon I will see "2001" big and fancy with @BillyTheMime
About Director's Cut: My wife @emilyjillette says that only 67% of people have opened the email with their screener links. If you did not receive yours, or changed your email, please contact Emily at the Make Penn Bad email.
@RealTimHowell @SpikeMcManus @RayCronise @papageod What matters, of course, is now.
@MarkBal93 I believe that's Paul screaming in Revolution too.
@Flash_Adney Is the bet for enough you can cut me in.  I think I know one.
@thejohnobrien Yes, and we sent out links and there were screening for you.
@Skacey Yes, it's WTF.   It's what's in my head.
@RJSeidler right.  When you are tryhing to get a crazy asshole to do your TV show, you let me know when you do everything right in retrospect.
@MickeyTod @papageod @RayCronise Sure, it's not a long term diet, that's plants.
@dontdropthatmic I might do that!
@TylerWWood Nope. I don't think it's the government's job.  As far as the science, there's more of it and it might be good, but our point was political and scientific.
@RJSeidler I think you're wrong.  He's not the one that's wrong.
@gwyddbwyl @RealGilbertACP @CardJunk @RealGilbert @Franksantopadre @Tom_Bergeron @Borschtdoc @MrCraigBierko @EddieDeezen @TheBillyWest Yes I heard that from Larry’s sister
@RJSeidler The action was not illegal.  So it’s a thougjt crime and why is he  arbitrator
@RJSeidler I don't know if just knowing what a person is thinking is reason to not let him do something that is acceptable.  I don't know.  I really don't.
@RJSeidler I suppose there's an argument to be made.  But . . . ending his career?
@papageod @RayCronise Gabba Gabba we accept you.
Eclipse Theaters - tonight at 7 in Vegas I’ll be hanging out and showing my weird-ass movie. Come by and say hi. https://t.co/wlQN9friyx
@MarkSpangenberg We are not.
@nicholasmegalis There were no trade secrets.  "People walk backstage" was the level of exposure.
We did our new entrance last night and people seemed to like it.  I guess we worked almost a year.  It's about 10 seconds in the show.
@PerryVonVicious That is SO great.  Wow.  I'm flattered.
@Shcamelli Thanks.  I don't know the schedule until the tickets go on sale.
@LasVegasBeet I sure will.
@MND373 New bit entrance.
@SteveBrazil75 Thanks.  I love 'em.
So, we've got a brand new entrance for our show tonight.  Let's see how it goes. You know, we could stick to stuff we know how to do.  But, we don't.
@nestersan We try to keep the prices down and we're pretty successful, but Vegas is expensive.
@genesimmons thanks so much.  Always nice to see you and chat a little.
@JamesGunn @noobandblond @TomArnold @YonduUd0nta @aholmes4418 thanks, baby.  And you make some very fine movies.  (PG Porn still my favorite)
@JamesGunn @TomArnold @YonduUd0nta @aholmes4418 I am known for pulling things out of my ass and proud of it. I am not willing to quote from memory, that would be wrong, but Trump certainly said things on the Apprentice set with me in the room that made me uncomfortable with the way he talked to people racially.
@iamotto31 You will get a lot.
@TomArnold @realDonaldTrump Yup, me Rodman, and Busey.
@CountLustig both.
Are you in Vegas Wednesday night?  Wanna see my weird ass movie?  I’ll be here to say hi. https://t.co/wlQN9friyx
@WendyBirdOZ Wow.  Thanks for letting me know.

@joseph_marrero_ @TheSciBabe @RayCronise @DamnedJuggler We talked to her a lot already.  I think she might be done.
@mag4music WOW. Thanks.
@T2M2Podcast I've bought 3 bottles, but I have no intention of trying it yet.
@mag4music I think I kind of thought but, but didn't go in.  I thought that was a John section.

@VagabondDavid A new season the summer.   Thanks
@TheFYCPodcast You need to read the moral landscape by Sam Harris to give you some more info.

It seems very likely that we're putting in a new thing tonight. It's just a new entrance. Probably about 20 seconds of stage time but we've been working on it a couple years.  Here we go.
@JBaumannTweets You may have.
Oh my goodness I loved Chuck McCann.  He will be missed.  Another Aristocrat gone.

Well, I played bebop upright jazz bass at the Green Mill.  I don’t remember ever being more nervous.  I did only one song instead of two.  I was shaking.  I almost threw up. I couldn’t feel my hands.  But . . . I did it and people were kind.
So, tonight I guess I'm going to play bass on two songs with @Jonesjazz at THE GREEN MILL. How is it possible that I will play jazz at the Green Mill?  Even two songs.  Wow.

@ConfessionsExMu @elGuapo_87 @LiquidDemonsCC @rickygervais @Ian_in_OH @billmaher I don't think there's any more damning criticism than, "You make me scared to talk to or about you."
@ericaamy I like pie and peanut butter cookies.
@ericaamy It is not.
@leighbeadon Oh c'mon, I'm not that bad.
@ZenasDeHoag @Jonesjazz That's the plan.

I just finished @sapinker "Enlightenment Now!"  I cannot recommended it too highly.  Please everyone read it.  It's life changing.  It sure changed me and I started out as an optimist.
@AP4Liberty It's important to remember that.  And it's none of our business who fucks whom.

@DrKabookenstein Yes, we wrote the book and the DVD and tailored a lot of the tricks. But manufacturing tricks that were totally new would make it too expensive for it's audience.
We are recording "Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us" 2018 for this summer. I really like this show. So much pressure and panic and then joy either way.  Man, there are some good goddamn magicians in the world.

@Karson85 Fires are more common and we also know what to do in them.  The advice they're giving is not tested enough as being useful.  It's just to scare them and feel like we're doing something.
@Karson85 I disagree.  It's too rare and their suggestions dont' help.  It's just adults not being adults.
@casey_lantz Ask @JasonGarfield

@yavannie24 Oh goodness.  So beautiful.
@vaylor @BerryOakley Perfect.  That's what I wanted.  Now I have my band.
@GDSounder I'm less extreme than me too.
@MCostaney Kinda
@LeicesterDave @LI_Mills @ErikJLarsen @peteholmes Off course.   My context made that clear

@TheKrab I think I'd have to know who.  Best to go through our website.
@lagranderusty I sure did.  I loved him.
@buckly999 It was my first time in charge of the picture, and I really did awful.  I'm checking to see if anything is salvageable.  I'm so sorry.
@GDSounder I think I may be okay with price fixing too.  I'm not sure.

@dorian_faust I had a lot of interest before that.
@SarahHines2017 It's great and will teach you a lot.
@MarkBal93 @THEGaryBusey I like him.

@JcPython1 I tend to side with freedom, but we'd need a lot of research first.

I’m on the plane to see Nez.  I have on my Monkees hat. The gate guy, “Monkees, huh, you’re Davy . . .no the tall one, Nesmith.”  So there.
Okay, I'm flying to LA now to go see my buddy, Nez, at the Troubadour tonight. I've been looking forward to this for a half century.  Wow.
@DayMoneyGS Yes.

@j1999t I remember you two, you were great on the new trick.  Thanks,
@nathanhaston Yup.
@VladtheImpala No, we're crazy.  We put in stuff all the time.
@justintutrone who told you that???
Oh dear.  THREE new bits going in tonight.  Really complicated hard stuff.  Why do we do this?   Well, wish us luck.

@BrionFoulke @SamHarrisOrg I love Sam and he changed me a lot.  I would do anything with him anything.
I didn't know it was possible to love a movie as much as I loved @MarshallMovie. I cried my eyes out.  Who needs to invent Spider-man, when we really had Thurgood Marshall.  So inspiring.  A perfect movie. AND BASS @MarcusMiller959 soundtrack.  And @joshgad is so deep and rich.
@AuthenticVegas @DBtodomundo I'll be going to this show.
I wanted to play Rolo on Black Museum of @BlackMirror but there were scheduling problems and . . .um . . . they thought that @Dhodgem was a better actor. Why did they think that? Maybe because he just is? Could that be the reason? No shame in me not being as good as that genius.
I finally saw "Black Museum" episode of @blackmirror  Oh my goodness. I'm so proud. @charltonbrooker made my idea so clear and powerful and bothersome and everything wonderful. My favorite show and I was involved.  Dream come true.  A good dream, not a Black mirror dream. Thanks.
@rexbologna Yes.
@terr0rgasm h yes, I know it.
@DonAndrewBailey @joshbressers I didn't write it.
@rudycoby Okay.  Acceptable.
@saintc119 It may have been a longer point, but I LOVE that I can say there is not god and the Beatles might not have been quite as good as I thought, and the Beatle thing gets busted.  Things are going well!
@HMintJam @ClarkCountyNV Very good points.
@Jillettente I think that art is trying to see things from other POVs.
@ProjectShawn What do you want, I'm 8 years old?
@KyleOriely @HBO @CrashingHBO @peteholmes Thanks, baby.
@JohnnyWoodard @weedywet I love that record.  LOVE it.  It's my life.   BUT, that might not speak to quality.
@sergio_27 Nope.  Never.
@MisfitDrewC See Mac King at Harrah's and @thepiff at the Flamingo and eat at Lotus of Siam.
@howieweed @SamHarrisOrg I know, I'm sorry it seemed competitive.  It was just something I wanted to do, and I am a little proud of it.  I guess that's wrong.  I don't know.
@MeditationAVL @GabrielEdwards @SamHarrisOrg NO NOT TM!!
@iamotto31 Look in the mirror.
@weedywet Yup, there's a lot of skill there, no doubt about it.  I know a bit about music, they sure can sing and write tunes, not lyrically able to move me
@bradsucks @SamHarrisOrg Usually 10 minutes but often more.
I just finished meditating for the 730th day in a row. That's kinda 2 years without missing a day.  It's @SamHarrisOrg 's fault and I think it was a good idea. I like it.
@svtmawesome I just started this season and I'm watching them in order.  So, I''ve just seen the first one.
@poppafunkadelic @peteholmes CAMEO???????  How long and how much does one have to do to be a character?
@K6mms Yes, but it wasn't recorded. it was a magic awards show.
@pgjuggler @EmilyJillette @RioVegas @MrTeller We will try to be good.  Make sure you say hi after.
@radioJW I am looking into it.
@trentage I'm so sorry.  We do tricks.  And tricks are just like someone telling stories that aren't true, but acting them out.  Teller did a make-believe of drowning, but he was never in any danger and he's fine.
@kevinpollak @RioVegas Thanks, baby.
It was 25 years ago tonight that we first played Vegas. 25 years.  I've been in Vegas longer than anywhere else.  I never would have guessed.
@Alkharon I never bashed him, I made jokes.  I've loved him from the moment I saw him.
@DesireeAlliance I sure like hearing that.  I like the ones I've met.

@whateverderrick I guess I must be misunderstanding the article  and this.  It seems both sides agree.
@GoldenKnightFan @LasVegasLocally @8NewsNow You, of course, understand that because it's a game I can have nothing to do with booking the acts, let alone vetting them morally.
@Hargman i'm so flattered.  Wow.  I do like the name Jad for no real reason.
@AMcastPodcast I'm sorry.  Should I stop doing that?  Am I embarrassing myself.  Now I feel awful.
@GoldenKnightFan I don't recognize the name.
@patty_chapman92 I'm so sorry.  The Rio lost power in that area and backup. Sorry.
@elinemd @PennSunday I thought it was a lot of info, not just birthdays.  But, I'm usually wrong.  I don't know where I read it.
@Vanch VERY.
@Dsigler1989 I'd sure like that too.
@mattsnyder @thepiff @FlamingoVegas I will be playing my upright carbon fiber bass not the electric
@svtmawesome @thepiff @FlamingoVegas We are SO hot in those costumes, and I mean that is a sexual way.

@dgoodz1224 It's hard to say.  I guess I know about 10% maybe.  Teller may know more.
@MordyJones I'm sorry you read it that way.  Please forgive me.
We have been at the Rio for 17 full years as of today!  Longest running headliners ever is what I'm told.
@ThorShreds Not to scale, these are people who aren't swinging that much.
@zymaze It's our family tradition.

Off to LA today and tomorrow to get a cast made of my head for a trick we're working on for FU18. Lots of new tricks to get down!
@StinavD I will put it out on Kindle as soon as I legally can.  I sold it to Black Mirror for a while.
@ryantcal925 Sometimes I'm just wrong.
@Dudley_May gabba gabba we accept you.
@EmilioSantiago_ I"ve seen a lot of coverage of KJU.  I guess I read different news.
Some people can't even be immorally, dangerously, and embarrassingly insecure properly.  A button is not a phallic symbol.
@raider_wayne YES.
@PaulDRecchia That's Lord Buckley and I've always loved him.
@kevinblah @FlixAnon @MrTeller @Netflix_CA This made me laugh so much.  Not everyone is going to understand, but thanks for giving us a try.  Not for you.
It's important to point out that @KChenoweth is wearing very high heels in that pictures. But, I believe we're the same species.  And at one time, I was knocking on 4 times her weight. (Now just 2.7)
Backstage with our buddy, @KChenoweth   She and I are different sizes. https://t.co/HaOCKZZcMB
@ThomasBuckley21 @piersmorgan I'm so glad.

@ZomBee You know, we hoped so, but .  . the only shocks were things being more bullshit.
@brideb88 I love you.
@cameronmount It's safer than us driving home by a LOT.  The biggest dangers is a light falling on us.  Thanks for understanding why that's something ot be proud of.
@PhilipCaveNL Well, see our show and say hi.  Also see Piff and Mac King.  Have some good Thai food at Lotus of Siam.
@megazone @skepticklish Yup, I can use my charger, but I'm getting them changed to a Tesla charger anyway.
@ScottyMacNeil @PhilipCaveNL I love them so much.  They're my relatives.
@catybara @blackmirror Thanks, baby.

@sanford17 Right back at you.
@jonibeech Haven't seen it yet, but I loved the script.  No doubt I'm going to love it.
@JWDiscord He's a buddy.  I hope that contracts will allow us to have him on.  I think he could.
@MisbehavinMaids I liked it.  I like women singing dirty.
Hey, @elonmusk - I just got one of your Groovy X's and I'm digging it.  I'd sure like to be able to make "Biohazad" the default for my allergies.  Maybe an update? Thanks for the great car.
@AaronBrynen @realDonaldTrump No, I do not.
@svtmawesome You know, cocks and stuff.
It was 23 years ago today that we did “The Bullet Catch” on stage for the first time. It's out of rotation now, but we still love it.
@thehardmenpath @WoodyAragon Thanks, baby.
@StreamedOnline Thanks, baby.
@KVO27 it's such fun, isn't it?
@5150Philip @jocampbe @HeyScoops @MrTeller Thanks, Phillip.
@Luellababe I have them at home and in my dressing room.
@skepticklish Yeah, I've got to change my chargers, but just the wall and the "hose," the power is run.
@sometimesyoufly @PaulProvenza Very nice.

@patrick0101 I want to be just like you.
As I've said (and wrote a book about) Every Day is an Atheist Holiday. So Merry Christmas to all whether it's a special day to you or not!
@EugeneMcCaffrey I look forward to watching.
I've just cleaned out my closet.  Wow, I was fat.  Any fat guys want a LOT of clothes to use until they get my book, "Presto?" and get healthy?
@KimAcheson right back at you.
@JennValjen OH dear.  I'm afraid I'm neither smart nor wise, but my heart is with you.
I'm battling to keep my voice with this, whateveritis.  I'm on steroids, and strict vocal rest.  Lots of other stuff.  No hot sauce, no seller, no talking.  Weird. But, I kinda have a voice.
@THEHANDOFOMEGA Hope to see him on the show some day.
@magicalfezman It's an example of the world always being wonderful.
@Deborahlyon13 @dyonnedewit You'll get used to it.  It takes once.
@WendyBirdOZ No opinion.
@James_A83 And you can do the same for trendy empty rhetorical short cuts to nothing.
@StratMatt86 "ATHEIST"
@AutowriterDan I already have 220 at home and theater.
My Leaf was wonderful for 5 years, but I got wicked sick of planning around what ended up being less than 60 miles a charge.  So, I just went out and bought a Tesla Model X.  Goes farther.
@RussCeccola Wow these are great.  Could you send higher quality to our website with any tagging info you have on date and place?  Thanks
@croakthedj I made a mistake and took aspirin, so not this time.

Come see us soon! https://t.co/s3dMxI8Sx2 via @YouTube -  we are here in Vegas (I’m in London for a day but you know )
Okay, I'm in London.  Tonight I'm seeing 'Twilight Zone" and tomorrow morning I'm driving a car really really fast on a TV show.  Yup, THE TV show.
@funny_bugger We're doing Fool Us then, come to the taping, it's free.
@Battalion2CERT Free and will be again.
@El_Cheve There's no good one.
@OMFGITSOSCAR @WhimsicalPhil Thanks.  Not really a "cameo," -- I'm kind of in the movie.
@RickSmith @wordsfromwags Yup, thanks for the book.  I rarely read paper, but I'll look at it and if I like it, find it on Kindle.
@OMFGITSOSCAR @WhimsicalPhil Nope. that's not me.
@Deadman0204 You will thank me every dip.
@TheAmazingBelk Oh, you can't talk to us.  If we know about it, you can't be on.  Go to the producers.
@RickSmith Yes. YEs.
@todio Very good point.
@keddyboomaleddy Hey, judging is what makes us human and have taste.  So I'll judge -- get more Dylan
@chrisramsay52 @XaviatorMagic @Ericjonesmagic @jay_sankey @xspade1 @JaszVegas @bucktwins @PatrickKunMagic Wow, that was good advice.  Teller always says, "The audience, I think, is on our side."
@Nine11c2 I guess that's technically ironic, but still an inelegant usage for my taste, but I wouldn't turn you off for it. But, thanks so much for listening some. That means a lot.
@CarmelShell I want to live there.
@TedCrawford8 I believe @RayCronise will be at the show that night.  Look for him and chat.
@glennbeck Hello, my friend.  I'm looking forward to seeing you and chatting on Friday morning. Have some black decaf for me, okay?
@magictriston https://t.co/XO3gxvB5yC
@laurenpolinsky @jaybaer Thanks so much.
@rickduggan @jzellis @ExDinosaur @glennbeck Nice to see you last night.
@PeteMannBand @tommychase01 Just white noise to allow me to read without hearing conversations.   Some New Age jive.

@smbonneau @ayacullo @quantumchrome Thanks so much for your thoughts and your time, but it's a wise choice to stop filling up my feed. Thanks again.
@smbonneau What kind of trouble?  If it was government trouble, that's very bad, I'm a free speech guy.  If it was just people disagreeing, well, they should.
@Nine11c2 I think it'll happen very easily without government mandating. But, if I'm wrong, I won't go to force.
@innocuous_floof It sure does, baby.

@Nine11c2 I'm not in charge.  Ride free.
@Nine11c2 Yes, but did I say the government should stop that?  It may seem like a small point, but it's the only point, isn't it?  Thanks for thinking about it.
@Nine11c2 I believe you misunderstood.  If I said that it was a mistake.  Or I was wrong.

@TyTySoFly503 @glennbeck I'll give it now -- You become naked.
@sgcarney You'd do better talking to Ray.  He actually knows stuff.
@mrjoshflores Yes you can.
@D_Bagofdonuts @sgcarney Are you telling me not to tell someone else how to represent me?  Maybe you need to think about that.  But, thanks for your help.
@WendyBirdOZ @MrTeller Thanks so much for the pictures.  Just got them!
@lathiat You will see new tricks.
@DEG_MitchMan We didn't know all the details.
@sgcarney that's not what I did.  I've kind of covered what I really did in my book, "Presto."  It wasn't a potato hack.  Far from it.  Hacks don't work on diet.
@sgcarney @LapegnaM Isn't that boss?
@dyonnedewit @Deborahlyon13 Not far enough.
Another 2 brand new bits going in tonight. One of them so deeply odd.  Let's see if we do them right and if our groovy crowds dig them.  Getting ready for FU18.
@SeanCampbell Yup.
@MeTommyJames Well, there have been many opportunities to see us together.  We hang now and again.
@magictriston We try to explain the show as well as we can, but some people don't understand.   It's our fault.  I hope we got better.  But, he didn't fool us.
@soojaganoo Beautiful.  I'm so flattered.
@dyonnedewit Seems very likely. And thanks.
@owengood Yes.
@AmericanDrGn I don[t know why you wouldn't.
@schmwarf @WendyBirdOZ @NickBakay4real I love Nick.
@theopalius Thanks for understanding.
@theopalius Talk about snotty.  Amazing.  I guess you've got a long way to go on your journey huh?  I guess you need more time.
@barryacoughlan @nicholsonbaker8 I don't think he goes out much.  But, I would love it.
@theopalius Because dismissing serious study of something for 10 minutes a day is not something I want to be part of. It's really wrong. Deeply wrong.
@gareth_winslow @Deborahlyon13 @AtheistRepublic It's a valid term,I don't use it much.
@theopalius I take back my reply. What you said is total foolish bullshit.  10 minutes a day, or real honest focus can accomplish a lot in any field.  Would make you a great card magician or juggler.
@JMCornwell1 @DesertBus You would lose that bet.
@Drewchild96 I will.  Thanks for your time.
@theopalius Very good point.  Yup.  I agree completely.  I hope I didn't act like I was claiming great enlightenment.  I'm just enjoying my life.
@Drewchild96 I will get to reading it.  A friend that I really really respect and have known for years loves it.
@Drewchild96 I have nothing to do with that department.  And I'm glad about that.
@Drewchild96 Yup.
@Drewchild96 I have the script.
@nicholasnewman Thanks.
@Drewchild96 It's okay if I want something different than you, right?
@Drewchild96 That's a very good point.  I was speaking for myself and my desires.  I spoke of no one else.
@Drewchild96 @TheFIREorg Thanks.
@SjSiobhan Bass.  But yes
@Drewchild96 @TheFIREorg And you do understand that I'm fine with anyone not watching anything right? The only punishment I suggest is me not attending that university.  Not much punishment.  Maybe reward.
@Drewchild96 @TheFIREorg Thanks so much for your time and your concern.  We'll do our best on our shows.  Thanks again for your kind words!
@Drewchild96 @TheFIREorg I'm sorry, that was out of line.  I'm a bit slammed now with a LOT of shows and new material, but thanks anyway.
@chl0mydia Yeah, there were several women in my class and many more later.
@No_Beret They haven't given that information.
@PaulMcElligott Yes.
@Drewchild96 @TheFIREorg I got nothing from FIRE.   And I turned this in a few days ago.  I can't imagine you would enjoy talking to me.

@ThomFewkes1 Gabba Gabba we accept you.
@Kimberami1977 It's all part of our culture.  As long as it taught as fiction and bad morality.
@Deborahlyon13 @AtheistRepublic You are an atheist.
@Deborahlyon13 @BertIsFat @RealRameau @AtheistRepublic One is a view of what is possible in epistemology and one is a personal report.
@Deborahlyon13 @AtheistRepublic Not actively believing is atheist.  And not knowing is agnostic. They answer different questions, but atheist comes from agnostic.
@antonydavies @AtheistRepublic Nope. Just not true.  Atheists don't actively believe.  That's not knowing. ;
@mjhawley @AtheistRepublic Knowledge system, theology claim to be that, but they aren't, they are belief systems.
@mjhawley @AtheistRepublic Knowledge is general, belief is personal.  Atheist is not what knowledge is avaliable or possible, but simply what active belief is in an individual heart at the moment.
@Murphdogg4 @AtheistRepublic Nope.
@mjhawley @AtheistRepublic If you don't know you can't actively believe. Agnostic has little to do with theology.
@distantcities @AtheistRepublic Nope, different subject.  I'm an agnostic in epistemology, therefor an atheist in theology. I don't actively believe, because I don't know.

@sfscherer82 I once brought SCreamin' Jay out to supper with Arthur Penn.
@Shelley_Smorth That shows some added sophistication.
@jagsfans Thanks for understanding.
@mbergs12 We meet everyone who wants to meet us at every show.  But, I'll wear a special suit for her.
@jormi_boced @RayCronise @fire350 @SweetMattyD @DamnedJuggler @DrFuhrman Gabba Gabba We Accept You.
Ever have the slightest question of why we do this?  Hard to stop crying to type.  Women are the future of magic! https://t.co/3tv6dXW4GP
@TransistorTravl @JoshHymanNYS @HarveyWeinstein I like you.
@ferretwilliams There is no reason, other than I think it's funny.
@MatthewHaislip A little.
@gdfreeman Yeah, but can I read it in the dark?
@Kyohazard Yup, and thanks.
@ELSkinner45 NICE
@TheMysticCraft @RealRonJeremy https://t.co/obmQaQD6QS
I’m am the least important voice in this discussion, but I get to talk about my daughter.  https://t.co/F4ZrbQ3SPU
@jeffreymacesin This is better right?
@RealRonJeremy We need to get you on ours.  Next time you're in Vegas.
@ferretwilliams Bullwinkle.
@JonWDHam @FearFactor @joerogan I hadn't remembered, but I believe you.
@LovelySusabella Not out yet.
@CreamerJean I like both of those things.
@JAbramSloan @RayCronise @SweetMattyD @DamnedJuggler Gabba Gabba We accept you.
@JoshHymanNYS @HarveyWeinstein Oh dear.

@TheMicroScoop @ScoopJessica @HuntressKills @JillJanus WOW.
@lhbergstrom You can't go wrong.  I like Solo Monk.
@abstractcoder @kenspencerct @KostaSots Wow.  I didn't know that (of course).
@aceofknaves88 @JillJanus @HuntressKills Yup.  Someone beat you to telling me.
@KostaSots VR version out next year.
@douglashanau @KBAndersen I'm not sure it is either.  But, it's what I was thinking at the time.
@Kevinha753 Either one.  You can't go wrong.
@gareth_winslow @WendyBirdOZ Yup, and us too.
@gareth_winslow @WendyBirdOZ Yes, but that's why we edit.  So we don't get fooled 3 times in a row and then never for 3 shows.
@ManInHatPhoto Thanks,
@gareth_winslow @WendyBirdOZ I mean, Johnny doesn't really have to be told backstage.  He just knows.

@davidtrocca I'm so sorry for your loss.
@mag4music It was held back out of respect for Vegas and then Ralphie.
@DrumsTheWord @RioVegas @MrTeller @TotalVegasBlog I can see that POV.  Thanks.
@THEGaryGreen Yeazes.   But, it sure it hard to write, isn't it?
@JoeJamesPop I had them all.
Bye Bye Ralphie.  You will be missed. https://t.co/ytOisLPZhj
@nerdmost They get one
The White Whale @Anthony_Etherin  — Penteract Press - You know, if you ever want a perfect piece of art for 2 bucks https://t.co/R0VN0zE3vn
@the_suzerain Nope.
Last night -- After all that, tricks not working and me falling -- the audience was wonderful and so kind to us.  Live showbiz!
Last night -- Jonesy noticed that I dropped a section in Love Ritual but didn't know he should just stop and yell at me.  Trick didn't work.
Last night - Teller was shook from screwing up Tomsoni, so he didn't notice me dropping a section from Love Ritual so it didn't work.
Last night -- New trick didn't work. I fell off the drum riser. Shook up and in pain, I dropped a section from Love Ritual so it didn't work
@MarkBal93 @genesimmons @KISSOnline Yup, I know him.  I like him.
@jorgbrown Used to.  Not now
@despilling @coasternaut @DisgruntIedJerk I've read the bible cover to cover 3 times. And I read it still.  It's what made me an atheist. I don't know how you can condone it.
@Francis1Mark @bwayfan88 this is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
@bwayfan88 I always want to go!
@Jazzistential @susiefelber YEAH BABY!
@JustGrantHere @DesireeSeattle @RichardDawkins Yes, he sometimes is tone deaf.  It was very embarrassing and painful for those of us living here.
@coasternaut @DisgruntIedJerk @despilling Thanks so much for your time, but you need to do some reading first.  Real "God is Not Great" by Hitchens and get some of this done first.
@genevish I was being interviewed for some TV people.
@coasternaut @DisgruntIedJerk @despilling There are compelling arguments for your POV.  You're not making them.  You're still on silly word play.  That's fine, but not boast worthy
@coasternaut @DisgruntIedJerk @despilling The use of the word "skeptical" in this context is a rhetorical trick that people love until they do some real reading.
@random_tangent Yeah baby !
@GreenfieldPD @YasmeenTV @KTNV Come by the show.
@DesireeSeattle @RichardDawkins What?
Part of a huge crowd of people helping.  The blood shoots up the droppers neck.  People are good https://t.co/tbrYTkBPmo
Very long lines of good people wanting to help.  Got rid of a double load of platelets https://t.co/sUzBbtUZHZ
@Deborahlyon13 Double dose of platelets baby
@spazattack13 @Andrewbadecker I do double platelets
@coasternaut @DisgruntIedJerk @despilling Yeah. It’s standard simple word play.  Nothing new.  Thanks for your time
The very least we can do and we are all doing it.  3.5 hour wait to give.  People are good! https://t.co/lX5RPR6IwP
@BigginsSniggib Good question. But it does feel different doesn’t it?
@coasternaut @despilling This made me laugh a lot.  Thanks.
@jeffhightower Good.
@coasternaut @despilling You are willfully not understanding.  But, I suppose you have to do that to maintain your faith.
@jeffhightower Thank you.  And please nurture your doubt.
@WendyOnWheels Thanks for books
We are safe.  We know nothing but we are safe.
@princemitchyd Very nice.
@WendyOnWheels @Rio I'm playing jazz before the show.  No time.  Sorry.
@Hunterman1956 Thanks for the kind offer.  Probably going to be hard for me to want to budget that time.
@despilling @coasternaut Spiderman said he was bit by a radioactive spider!
@coasternaut @despilling Oh dear.  Well, okay, if you want to change what words mean, than you're right.  If "God" means "Toasted bread," I believe in god.
@coasternaut @despilling I don't believe there's no god, I don't believe in god.  There's a difference.  I also don't believe there's a fairy in my toaster.
@wilamagila Thanks.
@THEJoshBrandon @81DeeBee @alydenisof That's correct.  Sometimes there are no foolers for a while, and they want to mix it up.
@81DeeBee @alydenisof So that all the shows can be edited together in any way that feels right.
@despilling Thanks.  And please nurture your doubt.
@BryonRaymond92 Thanks for the invite.  Congrats.
@FrEaK_HullFC It's for my Mom. That's it.
@cjlindst I know it well.
@Deborahlyon13 Dedication to my family by their weights.
@AngryGooseScoop I agree.
@BarryWallis I think so, but the edit all the shows from one pool.
@Larryrez It was just an easy trick that we weren't jugging.
@JadedLoveStory Yup
@eumrz I will change to Napoleon the third for you.
Went to the Playboy mansion just once w/ Al Goldstein &amp; son. Hef’s wife didn’t like that Al had a fatwa or my style of magic. Threw us out.
@lagranderusty Yes.
@Bovne Yup, I know those.
@ummdeiter @joe_bear Remember while you're doing that, to nature the doubt and read stuff you don't agree with.
@KimAcheson @SweetMattyD You, sir, are a great citizen.
@nerdmost @GWAllison I'm sure looking for it.  Let me know.
@joe_bear Nope.
@GWAllison @nerdmost We don't really know.  Most are very very honest.
@nerdmost Different every time, of course.
@briangovatos Thanks you.
@nerdmost Most of the time.  They run down to us.
@REAL_NAMEandSSN Well, it's my first name.
@Chee3eburger cock.
@My_Wicket @TrueLoveX5 @realDonaldTrump @MrTeller Of course.  Every vet I know agrees.
@I_Rather_fb @CWPennandTeller Oh dear.  Did you see our show?  I'm sorry about my French.
@BillRus73270016 @Mr_Manderson @HugoKitano You are no longer the only hero I have in sports, but still the best!  You are an inspiration, sir.
@SteveBrazil75 @TheDavidRangel Ain't nothing but in me.
@logananance Thanks, baby.
@TheDavidRangel Not "An award" -- a Nobel prize, don't you think?
@TheKyleGRiZZ From back in the days when we named some tricks with the punchline, it's called "Handstab."
@JanetGBrook You were great.  Thanks,
@WendyBirdOZ Great to see you.
@logananance Oh this makes me laugh.  I'm wrong about everything!
@JJ_McGuire OH thanks so much for that and the CD.
@engstromstudios I think there's no smoke and mirrors.  Pretty straight forward lying and hate.
@RaggetyGirl yes.
@cPolubinski yeah, look up Jason Garfield juggling. He's good at teaching.
Working on my first new juggling thing is years. https://t.co/xjPZhytzig

@Deborahlyon13 @VoodooChilly I'm working on  new bit.
@VoodooChilly Broken Bottle Juggling and 10in1.
@willjasen I saw one show live in Minn in the 70's.  It was really pretty and fun, but I had enough with one show.
@ryan_boyle45 @GalloQueretano Oh dear. There's no reason for anyone to be unkind about this.
@Pderop Starts at 2 today
I've never been to a football game in my life.  Never even watched one on TV.  So, if there is a boycott, I can start going and balance it.
@BradHackworthy @jenryannyc He sure is.
@prepositional_j Mox is a fine name.
@BradHackworthy @jenryannyc YES.  I said that to a friend right after I wrote that.  I know him.  Yes, Bill!
@AprilDrew04 My heart is with you all, and we'll try to be good.  And congrats!
@iSlingBlade We have jobs, but thanks.
The impossible has happened.  I have personal heroes in sports!  Real American heroes.
@castevens08 A little.
@vivanate Nice.
@dandelionmomma I'm so sorry.  Not our choice.
@ThankTankCr8 Yes. Thanks but no time to read It
@PaulTowheyJr Randi
@GodlessApeMan @SteveTheComic That's a different thing.  And thanks for the apology.
@Yiddleja @Cheffy423 @MakePennBad We are very very close now.
@GodlessApeMan @SteveTheComic It was within my integrity.
@GodlessApeMan @SteveTheComic That's not true.  And it seems like a statement like that without information is at least as bad as a lie, don't you think?
@GodlessApeMan @SteveTheComic The winning was authentic.
@GodlessApeMan @SteveTheComic It wasn't.  It really wasn't.  I mean, I guess it was "staged," but not "fixed."  It was just chance.
@MikFin @nickgillespie Well put.
@Bwgan See both @MacKingShow and @thepiff
@CustomKangaroo Maybe I can.
Bob Dylan's New Bootleg Series Will Spotlight Gospel Period - Rolling Stone — Hmmm, what do you know, an essay by me https://t.co/fdfDOJVDao
@BlindPedestrian Nope.  100 bill and spin twice for 3 dollars a spin.
@zinocat Yup, and we play in a casino, and people advertise on shows we're on. It's all tough. I might make a different call than you.

@GeneticCuckoo It was just chance.
I put 100 bucks (someone else's money) into our P&amp;T Slot machine.  I did 2 spins (3$ each).  Second spin I made over 280$.  Good machine!
@81DeeBee We are not smokers.
@UCofFootball that's for sure.
@thepiff I'm not green and I don't have a long tail.  Crazy people.
Launching the new Penn &amp; Teller slot machine (yup, it's nutty -- maybe too much honesty). Join us  tomorrow (Tues) at the Rio casino at noon
@silva0072 @MarkBal93 Yup.
@MarkBal93 It's what I always sang to my daughter to put her to sleep. We always sing it together.r
@AprilDrew04 I can't imagine.  We will try to be good.
@GretchenCordy @searay1945 I know that, but I'm filtering it through the Ramones..  Not original source.
@JoeJamesPop Oh, and that I've been meditation for 610 days in a row
@JoeJamesPop tell him I love him.
@jennieledwards Yes, I have very short hair now.  I gave it to "Locks of Love"
@MAVERICK1976P @channel5_tv We were on it, but I've never seen it, so I couldn't speak to that.
@avgmojoe Well, that makes me happy (not your anxiety, of course).
@donbrowne I will try to be more careful.
@MattLech I believe in climate change, if that's what's your asking.  And I haven't gotten a penny from Koch.
@searay1945 Gabba Gabba we accept you.
@Kevinha753 Im' sorry, I don't.  But, books are the best anyway.   Try the Card College series.
@zstonish gabba gabba we accept you
@ScrobtimusPrime @Jeopardy @nytimes I dug them both.
“Pairs Famous” Contestant answered Penn &amp; Teller. Wrong!  Next guy buzzed in with “Teller &amp; Penn” and got the cash. https://t.co/5e2AXee3dG
@GFXwraps "At all?"  Sure.  Worth it - no.

@nydybbuk Did I say "American?"  I'm an idiot.
@parisla @FoolUsTV I caught a flash of him palming off the books under the cover of the foulard.
@ricjoh Don't know.
@PuppyOnTheRadio @MagicCircleHQ @stephenfry They want him.  Not us.
Giving you all plenty of warning.  You might want to go see @thepiff the Magic Dragon here in Vegas TUESDAY night.  His Pop might join him!
@TheBadHumorMan @CraigDeFarmer @abigaillegamaro Thank you for noticing.
@AllHailTheKing1 @ByCats4Cats I agree.

@Beard_On_Wheels For my mom.  Yes
@JohnShackelford Yup.
@amycalandrino @MrTeller I remember you!
@mrrockker Very close to fulfillment.  Very close.  It's just long and slow.
@briankoppelman Credibility and manipulation don't matter as much as just plain truth
@DannyNewTV These were taken 20 years ago today.
@jbhonos @KellyHonos @RioVegas @CaesarsWindsor Similar?  Yeah, we're in them. Different tricks?  Probably.

@marix_k Thanks.
@GeorgeDierna Gabba gabba we accept you.
@LaStarTrek Might be.
@rsschrager @LaStarTrek Sure.  But, also the ask wasn't the government.
@GeorgeDierna I still love it.  I may not need it, but I love it.
@gareth_winslow Search for order.
@kinselgk No idea what this is.  Sorry.
@k_meyerhoff I will.
@silva0072 It is.
@LaStarTrek Seems like real charity could solve that, but I don't know.
@Hansel81 I've heard only good about it.  Seems great, but haven't watched it.

@sl_1090 You did a great job.
@AbeRandall I wrote a book called "Presto," but if you don't have the jingle, it just says "whole plants" in a funny way.
