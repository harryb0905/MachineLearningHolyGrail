That was pretty incredible https://t.co/nKLAfnUNqb
@ODE_Music Thank you!
@owlsinroadhouse Thanks
Have a look. Cadogan v Jenkins . If you are a guitarist in a rock band or (any prominent band member) you are going to want to pay attention to who gets Sound Exchange earnings. https://t.co/eGJXqujAF2

@AngelOfMusic622 @XEB_FOREVER Thank you Eileen
@XEB_FOREVER Thank you! Best fan group ever!!
@Jonnygrave Hmm, I dunno. I was in a rut once on open D (DADF#AD) so I changed the high E string back to E and the music for Narcolepsy was born a few minutes later. Sometimes changing only one string is enough to catch a spark
Good cause. Very cool https://t.co/c9tKPZc91O
@Chrissyinny34 Appreciate that. Thanks
@LastMileShop Was it ever released on an album?
@BattMasso Thanks
@danielholt Thanks
@MetalRiot Thanks \^^/

Didn't expect the news to get out this fast: https://t.co/lr98Q2ceR4
@Anthony19145 @Usher My lawyer is great though and not afraid to go all the way to trial. He got a jury verdict against Jenkins in 2011
@Anthony19145 Thank you. Much appreciated
@Electric__1983 The showcase was in 95. I liked Buckley's music a lot but wouldn't consider him an influence at the time. I had already formed whatever sound I was trying to do by then. Cheers
@Electric__1983 Grace came out in 94 so Jeff was already big by the time we showed up there.
@globelamp Ok, I'll do it. Send me a track and I'll send you back the guitar parts I hear. No charge.
@Electric__1983 Jeff Buckley was an icon of the time and yes he was there at our showcase for Clive Davis. Jeff  was doing chin ups on one of those doorway bars and lamenting about showcasing . Davis passed on us, didn't like the vocals.
@RollingStone But flaming lips has also one of the greatest songs ever with "Do You Realize"
@DouglassFamily @ZellnerLaw Congratulations @ZellnerLaw
@chadalenduff @MichaelAvenatti I fear for your kids if that is something you'd be ok with them writing in their yearbooks.
@samfhicks @colmmac @dbt1959 @MichaelAvenatti @butchgroves Stupid people shouldn't be in charge of teaching smart kids.
@nytimes As if his calendar at 17 years old would have an entry: " Secret party at Dave's house---parents are away". We all had daily calenders when we were 17 right? Get rid of this guy already
@MichaelAvenatti @butchgroves What happens in Oak Ridge school stays in Oak Ridge School. Or so he hoped.
@tedcruz And this is good for you because...?
@DirtyMcFilthy Ha, no that would be like hearing Trump apologize for something. They say perhaps it's a medical condition. Narcissistic Sociopath or something like that.
@DirtyMcFilthy @globelamp Great to hear from someone who was at those shows. Cheers
https://t.co/mvViGghpJC  Join me next Thursday. Lets do what we can to help Beto show the nation that Texas will lead the way! Beto ain't no phony politician or phony Democrat for that matter.
@globelamp The internet has proven useful as a way to expose those with nefarious intentions. You are correct that things would have been different if social media was there as a check. Overall, I am pro social media for those reasons.

@sioxielegend @JeanRay1123 @Cernovich @MikalaMM9 Kids aren't locked into Walmarts indefinitely when a parent is charged with a DUI-- at least in America, maybe it's different in Russia? You tell me.
@JeanRay1123 @Cernovich @MikalaMM9 No, its not what happens when someone is charged with a misdemeanor. Entering the country in that manner is a misdemeanor not a felony like grand theft or murder. No reason to tramatize the children further. Can't believe I even have to explain this.
@JeanRay1123 @Cernovich @MikalaMM9 So you are ok with the government spending your tax dollars on immigrant child minders when it would be cheaper to have their parents change diapers? Not to mention moral.
@Cernovich @MikalaMM9 Your question falsely implies that they are just looking for "proof". They are separating kids from parents irregardless of proof. How do you feel about that?

@SwellFeller91 don't know that one. I will check it out. If Arion wants to play something of that album then I will learn it.
@sjones1360 I was thinking of Arion not me. I know he wrote some tracks on that.
@Tendraftsdeep duly noted.
@chasenheimer oh, I didn't know you were being serious. Lolz I just never got into the vibe of that track. Lyrics are good though.
I will let you guys know @sjones1360 if we get hassled by them.
@norrismantooth ha, no thanks
You're welcome @jamesleakey. I'll do my best to make sure this show lives up to the support @3eb fans have shown for the music. :)

@chasenheimer @3eb oh yeah!! Lolz #songsthatsuck
Arion has some jams off of @3eb OOTV album. Anyone want to hear one of those in the set (limited set so would replace song from debut)
Thanks for the input everyone.  I appreciate you all! I'll post updates as I get more info on location and such....
I am told to keep the venue a "secret" for now..? Also told it is "state of the art theatre"...
Hey @3eb please no cease and desist letters like you sent me over the summer. Let Arion play his bass. Ok.
Arion also mentioned "Thanks a Lot" wow, beeeen a long time since I played that live. Maybe, maybe
So, burning man, wounded, narcolepsy, background, graduate, Red Summer Sun, hmm. Gorgeous.
@danjwilets @3eb Those are great suggestions. Much appreciated

Arion is now a member of the Chorus forum and has posted a message to everyone at kevincadogan.com His member name is "Kanegon". Go say hi!
@blairk maybe, it is something we are talking about.
@guidoconrad @Luke8400 yeah, you know, we talked and patched things up... like reasonable people...
@ScharffIsHere Ha, me too!
@ScharffIsHere I wasn't totally prepared to document the moment unfortunately.
Very special eve. 1st time jamming with Arion in 11 years and his first time playing bass in 6! Played wounded like we recorded it yesterday
@djdanii its what happens when  society creates a desperate population with nothing to lose. Kids want a future..healthcare education..etc.
@ScottCR1rider Thanks, it was of course a big thrill playing guitar on the show! I was lucky enough to do it twice.
Heading to woodside for the weekend. Hope y'all enjoy yours.
@mjradiodiva I would have loved that. Been a fan of his music forever. Unfortunately had to head back.
@evr3eb I will let him know. :)
A 3eb reunion of sorts at the DMV. Maybe someone else in line noticed what a unique moment that was.
Just ran into my ol pal Arion Salazar while waiting in line at the DMV.
@seckela yes, we made sure the label put some out on vinyl. It was a double record as it ran 54 minutes. You can likely find on ebay.
@CarlR14 play the Cadd9 on the verses than alternate C and Cadd9 on the choruses.
@CarlR14 On the record I played a Cadd9 & Overdubbed a C sometimes. The B and E string are fretted on the 3rd fret for the G chord as well.
@CarlR14 Thanks so much!
@norrismantooth I was just watching Steve Jobs address to Stanford in 2005. Congrats!
@norrismantooth Well, I am very happy for you Norris!
RIP Steve Jobs. Thanks for all the magic.
@jeffcoggins Great Job!!

WSJ reports that Radio Head is not playing. However, you can still go see the drum circle.
Radio Head plays Liberty park at 4pm. #radioheadoccupy
In 1980 4 guys started a band together and they kept at it for 31 years. Thanks for all the music and memories #REM
Just saw this wild vw bug. Covered entirely with cigarette butts! So nasty its perfect. http://t.co/CI93dBR
@joemott1 I don't normally give lessons. If your in the SF area give me a shout and maybe you can show me some scales ;)
@itskatieread Thanks Katie!
Amazing and insane video of flying dude along with cool song by @awolnation- http://t.co/C6DUUib
@Tendraftsdeep tossing a few LED headlamps in the pool looks cool too. Have a great weekend
@Kat1124 How odd. Which tweet was that?
@Kat1124 @OneRepublic yeah,Ryan Tedder is today's hook king
This is an awesome performance by @onerepublic- http://t.co/q84N4Gu. Love that cello riff. Insanely talented band.
@dheedhee I learned of these communications fairly recently and they explain perfectly why our partnership was never intended to work out.
@dheedhee false promises were made. SJ wrote an email to his manager stating his plan to promise me & Zen"forty acres and a mule"Google that
so @dheedee I'm proud that I couldn't work it out with one who equates band business to denying African Americans the fruits of their labor.
@dheedhee false promises were made. SJ wrote an email to his  manager stating his plan to give bandmates "forty acres and a mule"Google that
@dheedhee SJ was insistent upon owning 100% of the band. Not much room to work anything out.
@dheedhee yeah, a long time ago he taught me how to play.
Wishing everyone a great Saturday night!
New Show at the Henderson Pavilion in Las Vegas Oct. 13. Proceeds benefit Lili Claire foundation- http://t.co/b6x5l0f See you there!
@Tendraftsdeep I would go if it was billed as Billy Corgan, I've been a pumpkins fan since the early 90's not fan of marketing tricks though
"Smashing Pumpkins"? -They sure do look like a group of nice young kids. http://t.co/SclvQ4F
Here is my (real) Facebook account http://t.co/ZLZXdhr
Uploaded to Facebook a virtual walk through of my new creative space. Construction almost done!...
@norrismantooth Yes, the page with the blue check mark :)
new fire exit for the studio.. http://t.co/WAtMhzj
Is this thing on. Hey everyone, you can post on my Facebook wall now. I like Facebook. I think it might catch on.
Thanks for all the birthday wishes! Much appreciated. Hope everyone is having a great day like I am!
@Splint_A yeah but like you said you have the demos and their are only a couple unreleased songs missing from the internet. Not too shabby:)
@MattWRoberts Very cool! Is it the same guys who recorded "Fear"?
@Splint_A @falconpride77 hey, those were my song selections for "blue". There is no way that is going to happen.
@FilmMusicBlog Thx. I aim to get that one recorded by summers end.
@Meadehead85 haha-playdate. Ok!
@MattWRoberts Yep, they are great. Mike Jollett has a voice which to me sounds like Joe Strummer-rare indeed.
Beautiful here at vollmer peak above the fog
@falconpride77 Only if the name is changed to "Dumpling" and I can bring in my own drummer. Its the band not the name that counts right? lol
@ArnitaWilson I am rerecording that song along with many others mid August. Thx, for the inquiry.
@SarahWallHolt Your hilarious. Reminds me of a toy I had when I was a kid. The planes actually launched. 1976 baby http://t.co/su0pKes
@norrismantooth @danielholt one trick with logic is to always bounce 'realtime'. You will lose hard L/R pans if you bounce offline.
@norrismantooth I had to disable hot corners as expose was one cause of the crashing. Something they should have noticed in their testing...
@ArnitaWilson props from u is good enough for me, so thanks!
Heading into the baking hot central valley.
Back at ya @_JohnStephens hope your not overwhelmed by all those new tracks I sent you! Can't wait to hear your voice on them!
It was a show for charity, thank you to all the contributors! I had a great time!!
Peformed "rock lullabye" and many other solo new songs in front of a packed cafe crowd tonight. Much enthusiasum felt by all. Inspiring...
@EWaitkus good to hear! Thx :)
Why Apple chose the name Lion? Cuz, Lions crash out all day. Baadda boom. The fix should be called Lioness
Beware when upgrading to @apple OSX Lion. Logic crashes and I also lost plug-ins that worked with SnowL. #shouldhaveknownbetter
@RadRockabilly Thats all I ever could have hoped for when I decided to play music.  Thx
I changed the original lyrics when I saw legend @stevewoz in the audience. I have big hands so I need a big screen. Thank U for Apple Steve!
"Separation" from a unique audience perspective. That mic was loud!! Love It!!  http://t.co/20O4iIJ
@MattWRoberts yeah, very talented dude. Jelly Fish was a local band I listened to a lot and really respected. And respect to this day.
Thx to J.Stephens- a great job singing my third eye blind music on Fri- here he is.-- Neve - It's Over Now http://t.co/kLZJXdd via @youtube

@sarahsaturday I meant 2 n's.
@sarahsaturday Tamara Coniff is a beautiful person and so are you. Look her up.
@irisheyeZ77 It's an incredible series. Buy the season on itunes. DO NOT GO TO AMC'S WEBSITE. They give away the ending.
@irisheyeZ77  You sound like a suspect on AMC's "The Killing"
Cuz you earned it! @sarahsaturday
Erecting sound baffles while listening to Muse.
Dang, Just realized that AWB song is about crack cocaine. #nevermind
@chrish738 Thanks so much, and if your talking about those first two album, I didn't define their sound I just defined mine.
Feelin the love from y'all 2night. Needing to watch some soul train. Catch that dance move at 1:58

love hearing Fiona Apple sing 'everyday' - Buddy Holly tribute album.
John Stephans was with us at the viper room showcase that got us signed! Good Times!
@MattWRoberts He's a totally cool guy! Most fun I've had performing those songs live.
@ChristianJaymes No doubt. JS will be singing God of Wine live: Of course
@MattWRoberts what are the odds they have the same birthday? JS is exactly 10 years younger that SJ.
Meet John Stephans everyone! He can sing the hell out of my Third Eye Blind music! http://t.co/fgEPGUT via @twitpic

Ha! Nobody is going to go to that picture's show"@Irisheyez77: @kevincadogan Hey, I drawed a picture too!! http://t.co/0Brgfxk via @twitpic"
Thanks to @idledaylight for making my day with her awesome picture!
@idledaylight I love it! It's perfect! Thx for coming thru!
@MattWRoberts look at my timeline. I posted a link to some stuff that will blow your mind.
@Splint_A Mine too. Totally blown away. Never would have thought people would become so damn virtual.
@idledaylight make sure the eyes are huge. kids go wild for that.
@idledaylight Dont forget to find your pencils. I want to see your creation!
@idledaylight Hey! I didnt really mean that my drawing sucked, I was just trying to boost peoples confidence. ;)
ok, I know my hologram drawing sucks. I did it fast! Draw me your ideal hologram rockstar!
@ChristianJaymes haha! what? NO, no resemblance was intended. LOL
In case your just tuning in, this is what i'm going on about, http://t.co/1kOqzlh
Now all I have to do is get the vocaloid software and the hologramy equipment and this superstar is going 2 roll out! http://t.co/DvNolTd
I'm still amazed at the idea of hologram rockstars! No more hunting around for the next big thing, all I have to do is learn how to draw.
@adamattvcy I had hoped my comment would not be so transparent ;)
@Meadehead85 Thx :)
Keanu "Woah". "@cmzerodesign: I just liked "3D Holographic Fashion Show" on Vimeo: http://t.co/MCiF1YA"
whatever
cuz its a hologram........
I suppose its alright, I mean the band is still human which is a good thing and the singer won't yell "GREET ME" when it walks in the room.
Holographic pop stars? What do you folks think? http://t.co/1kOqzlh
@SONICINTERCEPT I tried to post the clip of the hologram singer introducing the human band. Pretty creepy but hey more room on the bus!
The joke only works if the link works- standby
@yrub yeah, a little. I wasn't that great. I rowed with heart though. We had a good time.
About to jump on a concept2 erg. It's been forever since I've done 2000 meters.
@Tendraftsdeep yeah, I'm working with Facebook to find the person(s) who did it.
If anyone sent a message to the impostor Facebook account and received a reply. Please let me know. Thx
Impostor is gone, Facebook just got a whole lot better :)
@jeffcoggins The budda pedal was not really a part of my third eye blind sound. It might have been part of the rig but I didnt use it much.
@jeffcoggins I like the way it sounds with a deville. They compliment each other.
@jeffcoggins that sounds like a great deal. Can't go wrong with that
@jeffcoggins not sure about the price. Im going to check out the mb factory next week. The transatlantic models are really impressive.
@jeffcoggins no, I like the nomad now.
Trying out new law http://t.co/rRAlawJ
Hi @finkd Heard ur fan of my @3eb music.Hope u enjoyed it at your house party.Think u can take down an impostor FB page for me?Thx man!
It is disgusting that some pervert can go on facebook and smear someone by creating an impostor account with pictures of young asian girls.
@bennomatic I have no problem with "FakeKevinCadogan".
Thanks to @biz and @Lukester at twitter for inventing a verification process that allows me to expose facebook impostors.#twitterrocks!
To all those fooled by that disgusting facebook impostor page, I am sorry that I just found out about it. #notfacebookfan
Lets see if this new law works- http://t.co/rRAlawJ
@idledaylight whomever does this stuff has no life outside of the internet and that is why their bones will weep in the grave.
My real facebook page has been verified by the real me. The blue badge. Thats why I prefer twitter  http://t.co/cHzzsuQ
I joined facebook again, you can friend me here http://t.co/s7v8tf3 un friend the impersonator http://t.co/ttWkMSj
So, Someone obsessed with me is impersonating me on Facebook (wonder who that could be?) If ur on Facebook unfriend that "Kevin Cadogan"
@Sacdaniel I'll have a stage in there. That's all the floating I need:)
@idledaylight yeah, it will mean a lot of new things :)
@joelcyu Knife music by David carnoy was entertaining and an impressive first novel for him.
Framing double walls for new studio http://t.co/xDqe8Nz
@joelcyu I certainly will. Still thinking of name.
@joelcyu I dont see the elephants anymore..ROCKnROLL!
@joelcyu Its great. Still putting up some walls, but should be done in 2 weeks
@joelcyu "rock horns"! I love it.
@idledaylight @Kat1124 @Tendraftsdeep @3eb Thanks. Always glad to help settle a dispute. Sleep well.
@idledaylight @Kat1124 @Tendraftsdeep -Did I settle the dispute amongst your friends or are you waiting for @3eb to chime in ;) #holdbreath
@KevinCadogan @idledaylight @Kat1124 @Tendraftsdeep Also, trains don't have helms, but we couldnt come up with any other descriptive word.
@KevinCadogan @idledaylight @Kat1124 @Tendraftsdeep @3eb Ah yes, its "bone". That song is about my few experinces with post sleep paralysis.
@idledaylight @Kat1124 @Tendraftsdeep @3eb -Bone or Phone? Please elaborate....
@sapphireyes88 Yes, Thanks for the mention! :)
@ifairyprincess Your welcome princess :)
Worlds most interesting playlist- http://t.co/wXILgJr Blind Willie Johnson's "Dark Was The Night" drifts into interstellar space.
@norrismantooth There are many Cadogan's in Ireland and England, I am told there's more in Jamaica. Ya mon.
@norrismantooth ha, no its not.
@NorrisMantooth no doubt, Dave Grohl is the king of rock.
Happy Blooms Day !
@GiffordJeremy Wonderful! Can't wait to hear it. I'll dm an address to send.
@ERICHON99 Keyboard pitch wheels will never capture the magic ;)
@ScharffIsHere "Back from Russia"- That is pretty dope. Glad you had a great time!
@ERICHON99 Awesome Eric! The prechorus is tough for the piano. (needs the string bends) what about ur violin?
@IamIndra Happy Birthday!
@HRiderReed Thanks! Eddie Money sounded good too. Nice of him to compliment the show.
@jdaniels13 no,brought in some great guest vocalists for most songs.
@ERICHON99 yeah, absolutely. I saw many folks filming.
About to check on construction progress of my new studio at Bridge Arts.
Just found out we broke a decibel record for Montalvo; Bent the trees back.
@MattWRoberts it was first titled "kiss goodnight" and we demo'd it back in 95. I prefer the first name we gave it. Loved tracking that one!
@MattWRoberts 'London' is a great idea!
Proud to be part of Montalvo's first Rock concert last night. Playing Montalvo again July 15th. Be There! http://montalvoarts.org/
@norrismantooth compare it to samples on the itunes store. AAC sounds good to me..
Had a great show at Montalvo last night. So much fun playing 'Red Summer Sun' and 'Thousand Julys' on a gorgeous stage.  Warming up for July
@norrismantooth I think the new Foo's album sounds great. I know what you mean though about records being mastered louder.
@Meadehead85 listen to the chorus of "black metallic" by Catherine Wheel, helped inspire jumper.
@idledaylight Just got back from there as well. Maybe we were standing in the same line.
loving the song 'moves' by #TheNewPornographers.
@Tendraftsdeep @SherylCrow every song on 'detours' is good and some are amazing. It's a true album
@pedrojf13 Thx. I recorded the music and played it for the singer. It was first called "swimming" cause the chorus sounded like that to us
'Detours' by @sherylcrow is such a great album. I hope her next one has the same production style
@idledaylight pretty sneaky of them.
My fav song,tied with "rope" on the new Foo's album is the one they didn't put on it. It's on the deluxe version and its called "Better Off"
About to watch what should be an interesting discussion with @MMFlint on CNN.
@norrismantooth that's crazy. Was that heading towards Louisiana?
@idledaylight @tylercdarling sure, DM your email.
@tylercdarling nice guitar!  I think you can download the acoustic version on the chorus site. If not I will make available.
Reading that OBL may have first been taken down by German Shepard SEAL team dog with sharpened titanium teeth implants. #jawscellosound
@tylercdarling Thank you so much.  I like that version as well.
@Lovedrugmusic Glad to have helped out. Looking forward to your new record!
finally getting around to listening to the new Foo Fighters album. I love that they went #1 all over the world.
Check out these beautiful "timescape" films- http://timescapes.org/
@dtizzle2 yo, the July show is here- http://montalvoarts.org/summerconcerts/
Actually, you don't have to be a Third Eye Blind fan to enjoy this little bit of rock history- http://t.co/eEAySUf thanks to @danielholt
The Third Eye Blind historical archive page has been moved to- http://t.co/eEAySUf interesting if your an @3eb fan.
@norrismantooth not that I am aware of. The url changed to.surfacingsubmarine.com. I will announce that
@blairk I'll sling some new cd's into the audience at the July show-unless its too dangerous.
@tylercdarling Don't worry about it. Its fine how it is now. Thanks for being a fan!
I forgive you, Mr. "not really kevin cadogan at all" - Now go throw a football around with some friends!
The only fan website that I will post messages on is this one- http://bit.ly/li3ybt.
Working on new songs in Calistoga. #VolcanicRock
@CodyWellerMGMT THE CLASH? #jeezluiz
What do you think of MOG.com? Are you listening to more new music or dicovering older music you missed?
Checking out the band- Titus Andronicus- just got a good write up in Daily Cal.
showing friends www.improveverywhere.com -love that site.
@jeffcoggins @MesaBoogie If you don't need 3channels maybe go for the TA30 combo instead of those. Out of your list I like the electradyne.
@GiffordJeremy I used a prs and the mj archtop, which I believe became their "catalina".
@GiffordJeremy check www.mjguitar.com They feature collective soul on website but I also used a lot of their guitars on blue. Good folks.
@ERICHON99 I'll put you on the guest list.
@norrismantooth I meant "looks" as in specs. It doesn't actually "look" all that great compard to mesa. But your right, that doesn't matter.
@jeffcoggins jury is still out on that one. Need to spend time with the transatlantic. It certainly wins for looks.
@norrismantooth looks like a nice amp! I need to try egnater.  I like the power feature on the tourmaster. 18-100w 4channel. tubeblending,.
@ScharffIsHere Woah, that is ultImate creepy dude speak! Its funny how they have a tweet now button to your followers, NO THANKs!
@ScharffIsHere that is hilarious! Its the new magic 8ball!
@ScharffIsHere That was your twitter view into your soul? "Steelers suck?" Now that is funny!
Bizarre it is, that's what it said. Here's the screen capture as proof @ScharffIsHere http://t.co/gjdlgUs
@ScharffIsHere Yeah, thats some "Watson" shit right there. What does yours say??
Listening to market! Indeed, I unveiled battle correcting the 90's. good thing evr Thats right! — http://thatcan.be/my/next/tweet
Good question, @ScharffIsHere, try this- http://bit.ly/dRUcM6 It distills all your tweets into one...will post mine in 30 seconds, hilarious
And low watt amps save electricity. #worstarguementever
If you already own hi wattage amps like me, than thats ok too. Its a future thang I'm talking about.  #whythepowerbrakewasinvented
Checking out the @MesaBoogie transatlantic & #vox night train for traveling. Glad to see so many low=(better) watt amps coming to market!
@hippiee1997 Indeed, I know lafayette well. Great place to be a kid, very peaceful.

@jjwielgus Ha, thanks! And thanks for getting those guys in lovedrug to record God Of Wine. Very cool of you...
@GiffordJeremy Well good thing UA just came out with their Studer plugin, for us non-magical folk. Sounds like tape!!
@GiffordJeremy wow, that is a skill! @michaelbeinhorn sure knows how to make protools sound like 2inch tape. Magic words? Recipes?  Spells?
Kathryn Valentine from Go-go's is tweeting her entertaining memoir here -@kvmemoir
@bcorso21 lol, ok. Understandable especially in light of what he needs to prove in court. Here's some research for ya- http://bit.ly/eqjOuV
Nah @bcorso21 not with dude who dyed his hair and dressed like me. Only one true original & that's me hombre. Goodluck. #nomoredoppleganger
@GiffordJeremy I want to hear that God of Wine cover! Btw..The Sucker Punch Show sounds really good. Is that 2inch tape I'm hearing?
@norrismantooth they like to sing funny songs over looped guitars & beats. There's always an acoustic guitar and shaker close by.
@bcorso21 you've spoken to Arion about this?
Congrats to @keaneofficial for their first show in China!
@BLondon1 rehearsal
Emphasis on the "getting"...tomorrow!
Getting ready to make some noise. http://t.co/9h1YEec
cranked the volume for 'Pushing The Shine' by Lovedrug. Thanks to @giffordjeremy
.@norrismantooth its an all new thang with special guest singers. A celebration rather than revisitation
@dheedhee yes, of course!  I'll never forgot the amazing shows in Indonesia! Playing outdoors in Bandung was beautiful.
Checking out the #radialengineering Bigshot SW2 for two amp channel switching. Anyone tried their other pedals?
Come out to the show on July 15th- http://bit.ly/g9hAnJ Look for surprise special guests
Thanks @idledaylight, hope your day was great as well! I will certainly post pics of me dressed in beaver pelts mushing through town!
@tcast211 yes, I have a roadster and love it! It's all good with MJ guitars!
Discussing the concept of urban dog mushing with a footbike.
Met someone riding a "footbike" on the fire trail. I might have to get me one. 19th century steam punk style.
@SarahWallHolt ah, there you are. Happy Birthday!!
Congrats to @TeslaMotors for being named Americas fourth car maker by MS. I remember when they were just a website, now look at em go!!
@Meadehead85 @JasonCamiolo Well, you guys did an awesome job! I think its a wonderful score,mix,everything.
@Meadehead85 OK! So, you did the xoom superbowl ad music? Nice job!!
Hope its as beautiful where you are as it is in SF tonight. The night is warm and alive.
@norrismantooth Sounds great! I don't have any acoustic recordings from back in the day, so thanks for sending that one.
@norrismantooth I'm not sure what you mean by "APC Sessions"? If you have any questions about recordings I am happy to answer best I can.
@rich3eb the interview with Arion is especially interesting to me.
If ur an @3eb fan, here is a nice press archive- http://bit.ly/e7nsw3 Lots of guitar articles too. Thanks to @danielholt.
If your an @3eb fan, there is a nice press archive here-  http://bit.ly/e7nsw3 Lots of guitar articles too. Thanks to @danielholt.
@ERICHON99 I had not. She certainly has a great voice for Broadway. How did you hear about her? btw, that's my fav christmas song.
@PArtY_Infinity  Its a demo. I'm glad you like it:)
@PArtY_Infinity yeah, ran demo through some mastering software as an experiment and it made the rounds. Would have been great song for blue.
@PArtY_Infinity Nah, 99% sure thats the demo with some mastering compression on it. Where did you hear it. I'll check it out.
Heading out to the little farm to feed all the hungry sheep and goats.
@stroke9 Thanks guys! Love that BAM pic you posted. Best award show ever!I love that they had "best bass player" and "best drummer" so cool.
@idledaylight Most kind of you! Hope your having a great Sunday!
@Tendraftsdeep Your welcome. Hope your having a great Sunday!
@irisheyez77 true, but you were also born with dark eyebrows. Black hair and blonde eyebrows no good.
@irisheyez77 Carson Daily asked kids their fav video, one girl says  'jumper' because of "guitar guy who jumps backwards"#fame
@irisheyez77 I unveiled battle braids on the Jumper video set. Dying my hair black later on is only thing I regret. #youthereputdownhairdye
@irisheyez77 yeah, you hurt my feelings there;) I like that top comment "guitarist is from year 3255"ha..spiky braids was girlfriend idea...
@irisheyez77 @norrismantooth That's why I was wearing my Kitanica battle jacket back then. Constant vigilance. lol.
@norrismantooth @irisheyez77 I remember that i had sprained my ankle running a few days before that show. Still a decent performance though.
Trying out a Shadow Hills mastering compressor, a beautiful piece of equipment.
@teezpete bingo!
@irisheyez77 He tried darling. He tried. Can't knock me down.
.@norrismantooth Nice try! LOL. He opened for us once & Steve invited him on stage for that song. Brad confirms-http://tinyurl.com/4ukwhx5
About to check out the happenings at the great Lawrence Hall of Science
@LBitter I wish that was the case, but we struggled for years in bars. George Earth is the "original" guitarist by your definition.
@stacersk  not a problem, take care:)
So lucky to have Semifreddis bakery close by. Berkeley food is the best :)
@stacersk lol, he signed that?
@JemiLove4Ever I don't know. He says he briefly left the band in the 90's and was a founder. I figure there must be some press about that.
@IamIndra it just silliness. You can join the next contest :)
@JemiLove4Ever no, the winner has to find something published in the 90's.
@stacersk good try though, that's a  rare article, way before Brad's time too.
@notlikethesoup well, apparently he doesn't know that. lol.
@notlikethesoup right, but his lawyers say he "briefly left the band in the late 90's" (?)
@notlikethesoup well, this contest is a response to his press release saying hd left the band "briefly in the late nineties"
@IamIndra Yes, it is a contest.
Contest! Win $100 & signed @3eb CD- show me a magazine or news article published in the 90's mentioning Tony Fredianelli as a member of 3eb.

@BLondon1 your right, but someone beat you to it. Next time!

@SarahKraus certainly sounds memorable, little foggy though. Congrats on your successful studio!
@djdanii my goodness. Sorry to hear about that. You went through criminal prosecution for fibbing about your residency?
@norrismantooth I thought you'd find that amusing. Mandelbaum is not really my enemy.Bizarre situation over there.

Double OT. Amazing

@PressSec Most people probably do not know that POTUS used 22 pens on that one signature. Thats why the 'O' looks weird. Beautiful sig. tho.

@mcardinalian Eu amaria jogar a música em Brasil.
@danielholt That was a sucky game.
@liviacardinali Obrigado...;))
@ERICHON99 Yep... Big Red. Both Cal and Duke had four minutes without scoring. The difference was Cal couldn't score during Duke's drought.
@mcardinalian Obrigado. Eu desejo que você tem muita felicidade.
@mcardinalian Yes. I am working on it now.
@liviacardinali Naturalmente. :)
@liviacardinali Eu penso que é uma língua bonita mas eu não a compreendo.
@danielholt No, but the att cell coverage is not good here.
@liviacardinali agradável para encontrá-lo
At least it was cool to hear the Cal song going to commercial
@Davelopez72 Is he still in town??
@norrismantooth Oh I see, your talking about using the rough side of the pick. Yeah there is merit to that grating sound. I dig that.
@cbsmcmanus Wonderful job bringing the NCAA to us this year. I know your going for Duke but if Cal's ahead you'll get better ratings.
@norrismantooth having said that, I did use a quarter to get that aggressive sound on the solo to "Graduate"
@norrismantooth Unless the are light, picks are not the variable. It's finger pressure and the force of the right hand on the strings.
@danielholt Go Bears!

@thirdebabe Hello, and thank you.
Happy Birthday
@jblythe76 Mixing gigs keep getting in the way.
@ewagnerdesign If this guitar is in addition to the LesPaul get a 335 or try an MJ Catalina. You'll have a good variety of sounds.
@ewagnerdesign I wasn't the only one playing on that I believe. A Gibson 335 was used as well as a PRS mcarty. You might like the Mcarty.
Appreciating a painting. A nocturne.
Just made some tracks available on www.kevincadogan for the low price of..free. One of them is a vocal tease at the end and it is ROCK.
@norrismantooth Good luck. The "rain piano" is also a very nice sample. If I'm using piano as featured instrument I record w/ a real upright
@mjfan4life He's just having fun. No problem there.
@norrismantooth Its not a standalone instrument and it will work with both mac and pc. I use a mac. It's my favorite piano for pop mixes.

@ERICHON99 yeah, I've seen it. I love it. I also love the marching band version. The song's cool too.
@kensingtonmarm Yeah, I was thinking twitter would be useful to them. Even if they just send reminders to eat.
@ERICHON99 Actually,  I have  beautiful Christmas music for a new generation. If it wasn't for all this rock stuff I would do classical.
@kurtpeterson21 No, I played the kazoogle on uncle hukee@kimyadawson made a great record for parents that are sick of wheels on the bus.
@ERICHON99 It needs some massaging and vox, but yeah thats sort of the ideal use. I also need to finish my Christmas and Halloween songs.

@so_disco that has been pretty much my primary pedal since blue when zvex sent it to me.
@so_disco you know I just always go back to the Zvex Creamy Dreamer for lead distortion.
@so_disco Thanks man, that's an incredibly kind complement. Let me get back to you on the pedal question.
@irisheyez77 yes, and it's perfectly fine to use it on your face as well.

@ScharffIsHere Honored your a fan and grateful that those 3eb albums made a difference. Looking forward to SNL and I dig your songs w/royals
@fionadilla Thank You. I loved playing Jakarta.
@ERICHON99 our situations are very different. I have no interest in getting involved legally.
@ScharffIsHere NIce to meet you too Jared. You Rocked the SCL on SNL. Too bad the clip is cut on internet. Licensing fees I guess.
Heard I would appreciate SNL tonight??
@irisheyez77 You know what's funny? He's not even in the picture. That's me!
@davelopez72  A relief to hear your family and friends are safe in Santiago.

@Davelopez72 Cool.Lots of possibilities with @babiczguitars. It could be mod'd as a cajon or used to make crazy sounds playing behind bridge
@fallingman16 It sounding good in the venue. Didn't spend much time checking it out, I noticed with the design one could use it as a cajon.

@MattWRoberts take another listen to Stroke9's other albums. There's a lot of good stuff there. And they did it on there OWN.
@MattWRoberts Yep, all those you mentioned are stellar. I was especially happy for Better Than Ezra's comeback as they helped us out a lot.
@MattWRoberts As a general rule that's true, but Stroke 9 sold a million and there label still couldn't support a great platinum band.
@lukester Thanks Luke!
@ERICHON99 I think they are great. They got crushed by file sharing cause 2nd record was sumamente expensive to make and free to share.
@Lukester haha, you mean the "twizlle"
@BradDCardwell  Wasn't in the tuning I used on the album. Doing it over so theres no confusion.
@lukester Did BT bring it to you proper at the Party?
@mattcheetos Yes, there were others that wanted that info too, so you would be helping folks out.

@Davelopez72  Hey Dave. Just so you know, you would have been the best choice for replacement guitarist. My vote don't count though;)
@dangreenman  I didn't catch that in the manifesto. That's like Lee saying she joined in 2007 or whenever it was she hung out. It's bs.

@asliger  well, I'll go through enough of it, wont repeat verses though. Its a long song as you know.
@ERICHON99  I see your point.  I'd like to see a girl guitarist rock my music in that band. That would be a smart move.

@norrismantooth  funny about that video, reminded me that Randy Jackson our biggest supporter (TEB)  tried to get us signed to Columbia.

@asliger  "Twat" was supposed to be my clever acronym slang for "audio tweet". Hope I didn't offend...

@chrisduffey  Thx again chris. I'll post mor vid tomrw. I'm working with Carmer who did blue and Produced ironically OOTV. Its happening.
@norrismantooth  Well done then.
@chrisduffey  I'll be singing. Its not gonna be made for 3eb fans. You might like it who knows.

@chrisduffey  Hey chris. Hope your well.
@asliger  Thanks for the tip. Sounds dangerous.

Nevermind... Best not use a campaign slogan from Herbert Hoover. Jeez. I'm not on a roll tonight. Goodnight birds
@asliger  I'll do it. How about, "Guitars not Guns" or "A guitar in every pot" ( google chicken in every pot) a chicken?... Rough days...
@MattWRoberts  That's amazing Matt. Thank You.
Oops.. I meant; What else could we do with 100,000 million. "Billion" has lost it's impact.
@MattWRoberts  RE:RATM Tom is a true gentleman. I like him a lot even though he beat me three years in a row for best guitarist award. silly
@joelcyu  Happy new year Joel!
@MattWRoberts  I hear you on that. Although, kids are discovering music in ways I could only dream about. Everything is a keystroke away..
@MattWRoberts  RE: soundgarden; I think it's great! That's what it's all about these days. And they are doing it right not a phony mock-up.
@MattWRoberts  Really? Music hasn't changed. Kids are listening to the same stuff I did. Kids are listening to me even if they don't know it
If you know what a "V hold" knob is your getting old. I don't know what it is.
I typed the words "happy new year" more times than I said it.
@norrismantooth  It's blasphemy if it hurts their fellings and the offender can pay the $40,000 fine. Bill Maher better cancel his tour
Beatles had the best selling album of the decade. The Lost decade indeed.
@LukeJohnston  I actually liked that guitar. Pity I had to destroy it for a scene that got cut.
@ipodconga  Thank you, it means the world to me that you feel that way.
@LukeJohnston  Very cool. They are great people. Tell em I sent you and have them put in a custom kill switch. They'll do it for ya.

@tmorello  A well deserved Congrats to you Tom
@LukeJohnston  Re: I like the MJ's. For studio, Les Paul's can add color and articulation but for live they are too cumbersome. Tell em hi!
@LukeJohnston  Re: for the 3eb album "blue" I primarily used a mirage and PRS mcarty. They are worth the money. Best guitars? Depends.

@justfinish  well, I suppose the predominate effect is a Leslie and not the kind we use today that comes in software. Eric V had a real one.

@jblythe76  That's great man. Tuning to perfect fourths is fun. That was a quickly written song!
@ERICHON99  That's right! What was I thinking. An addidas rep probably paid me 5 bucks in the parking lot to wear that.

I've halted production of the record. I want to devote more time to Tweeting.
@MattWRoberts  Yeah Jason Carmer. Engineer, mixer, producer for a bunch of stuff.
@MattWRoberts It's called here for now. I'll likely rerecord that w/ Jason. For some reason i played that acoustic w/ absurd aggresion
@jblythe76 Re:line6 Line6 Amps sound flat 2 me .Perfect if yr in a cover band and need many tones. I have high hopes for the bogner/line6.
@KevinCadogan That song is badass. It's 1 of the best songs written by anyone. yr guitar on its absolutely magical (cont) http://tl.gd/117lv
Speaking of Edge. He's Twitter page is immensly cool. Just pics, no text. I might be able to copy something of his after all. Minus stadiums
@jblythe76  Song is about a friend of the ex-manager.
@jblythe76  Yeah, references to hospitals abound on our first record. After that recording we could have all used a little medical treatment
@jblythe76  I never use wah for the wahka- wahka sound. Slow sweeps or 3/4 position is way to go. "Jumper" is good example. Just one note!!
@jblythe76  Congrats! That's great news and a good cause!!
The Edge told me that he didn't think our styles were similar at all.  I blabbed alot about what an influence he  is. I guess he's right.
@JimCarrey  That and "Hushabye Mountain" from Chitty,Chitty, Bang Bang.
@jblythe76  People think I used alot of effects on ST like the Edge or something. That's not the case. The chords and music were the effect
@jblythe76  I used a simple boss digital delay and rotovibe as my only effects. Eric had an Eventide, used for ambient sounds "background".
@jblythe76  The distortion on "God Of Wine" is the tiny Ampeg Jet cranked all the way up.
@jblythe76  The vox tonelab is good as long as you bypass phony amp simulations. Use a Morley switchless wah...sweet.
@jblythe76  There are so many amps on our self titled. Hard to point to just one.  I'd say Marshall plexi, Tweed, 5150, ampeg jet, Magnatone
@jblythe76  I really Like the 3 channel Boogie Nomad combo. A friend is starting to sell his amp design which combines Marshall plexi/w AC30

When I do these "answer" tweets does it make any sense to you? Is the context lost?
@joelcyu  That's why I'm still making music and 3eb for that matter. Keep jumping!

@jblythe76  Thanks. He is (was) a great player and nobody knows where he is I mean NOBODY. Weird.
@joelcyu  In the past Stephan was always excited to hear my ideas. We gave eachother space to do our thing. We barely interacted in studio..
@jblythe76  Last time someone said check out a show it was "Lost" I downloaded 3 seasons and didn't see my kids for a week, dishes pilled up
@joelcyu  No. When the guitar hook was there and Stephan and Eric finished lyrics I knew it was good but I didn't care about it goingtop 10.

@joelcyu  For "man on a wire" I used the same auto harp that I used for the album version of HIGB but this time it's a fast song.
@joelcyu  HIGB went all the way to #3 on top forty making it our biggest song despite being a ballad. SMCL went #1 on alt. Rock charts.

Kanye is supposed to be on Leno's premier tonight.. Hmmm.. Another Hugh Grant ratings boost?
Steve Almond was a proffesor at Boston College but quit his job as a protest of condelezza's honorary degree. Hmm. Perhaps perfect lyricist
Just finished two  Steve Almond books. I highly recommend him. His books are filled with the most original metaphors.
Anyone that's confused why lawmakers are so concerned about insurance company profits should YouTube "The Awful Truth congressional pimp".
John Stewart was at the top of his game last week. Good stuff! Especially interview with Betsy. She resigned from her job the day after.
It was very smart to target 3eb fans with an album promotional code on iTunes. I like that idea. iTunes has no ep chart.
The record industry has really turned into a t-shirt industry anyway.
Looks like it's going to be an album instead of 2 ep's. If Jenkins has to discount his to 3.99 there's no point in doing an ep for 5 bucks.
Michaelmoore's new trailer is out check it out on michaelmoore.com. Looks like another great movie.
I especially like the guy in the tophat who explains to an anticare lady the beauty of privitizing the fire dept.
I love these guys www.billionaresforwealthcare.com Satire is such a great tool to fight the absurd.
I'll post some historic photos of this meeting with my old nemesis from the museum summit. It's really an incredible  story.
I use the neve 1073's, Fairchild  as a limiter  and the pultec eq. The Helios is great  and is modeled after the console where I record.
I just tracked guitars for a new song with the MJ Archtop. That guitar sounds great through a magnatone amp. So warm like a hug.
Heading into the "Hatch" to record moe guitars
I love this show Man vs. Wild. Totally satisfies the latent primitave collective subconcious. It's like James Bond meets John Muir.
Third Eye Blind manager and I met at a museum in SF. Remarkable considering the last time we spoke Clinton was in office!
Avant Electronics I mean
The primary vocal mic is an Avantone CV-12. Great mic for the price! If you pick one up call Avantone mention me and they'll hook you up!
The logic 9 amp models are pretty good, but still can't beat a 57 and 421 mic on a real amp. Those guys at apple did a good job though
The guitar tones are turning out Great! Very familiar sound...
I'm using the same guitars I used on "Blue", PRS Mcarty, MJ Gold Archtop, Martin Acoustic, same amps and mic pre's, Boogie combos, magnatone
Eric Godtland walked me through his case... Tons of juicy stuff. It will prob, settle out, if not I'll see you at trial in Dec. Popcorn....
He did admit to me though that the "collection" was Jenkins idea to rebrand the band and make it seem like the current guitar player was me.
Had an interesting meeting with the now former manager of Third Eye blind. He is in a major lawsuit with the current owner of the band.
I'm using the same Autoharp I wrote the music for " how's it gonna be" but this time it sounds rocking
The song titles are subject to change of course. "there is no why" is inspired by the movie Man on Wire. Maybe just call it Man on a wire
George Lucas once said he would still be working on Star Wars if it wasn't for Campbells book Hereo With a Thousand Faces
Reading Joseph Campbell's Pathways To Bliss. A must read. He spent his life doing all the hard work and all we have to do is read it.
I'll be posting new songs on myspace and quickly taking them down so fans can get a first listen. I'll tweet before I do it :)
Finished basic tracking for 7 new songs "There is no why" "Together" "what you wanted" "Joan of Arc" "Wedding Dress" "Safety" "happyintheend
New recordings are progressing beautifully. Easily my best work yet. One month to go!
At Callies choir performance.
I mixed a record and upon listening was told the artist levitated. That's a first!
Wow Adam Johnson needs to meet Mark Johnson.
I just wrote a piece of music on a six channel guitar with a delay on each string. My friend  designed and built. Historic moment. MJ gtr!!
Dropping Callie at school. Yawn, forgot my coffee
The monitors sound so good I've done very little but listen, no twittering, I ha... Read More: http://is.gd/p1Jd
Wondering what these huge studio monitors will sound like once I get them hooked up...
Forgot I have to call Daniel at Surfacing submarine.
Just watched John Stewart do a masterful smackdown of CNBC... All those stupid shows that fueled this mess. It's up at Huffington post.
Playing a banjo for the first time in forever. I used to sit up next to the bus driver on tour and play sloppy bluegrass. doingdittydoing.
Got confirmation for show at Pandora Radio on July 1. Pandora is the only thing going on in Oakland. Cool people there.
