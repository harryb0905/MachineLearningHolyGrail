In other words, because the threshold for the 25th amendment is so high (higher than impeachment) there must have really been something spooking Rosenstein that he floated it.

@jpodhoretz Yes, 4,000 words in to the politics of 1981 I’m just trying to put a different number of the number of Boll Weevils than the 63 Democrats who voted for the budget and 48 who voted for the tax cut.
@twm3823 And Reagan is also no longer president. Fortunately neither of those points matter to the work I’m doing.
Anyone know how many of the 244 House districts controlled by Democrats in 1981 were districts where Reagan won? I don't have time to do the math before deadline and just know one of you has this number scratched out in chalk under your shop table next to the locker combination.

@Ed_Realist But Eisenhower named Brennan, a Democrat (and Catholic) because he was worried enough. This also works the other way. Dirksen knew Nixon would win in 68 (why Warren retired!) but helped Johnson with Thornberry and Fortas (until late September).
@Fdr1942 Yes.
As a reader points out, which I forgot to, the assertion was not that the nomination and confirmation both happened in the same election year, only that the nomination in an election year was not confirmed.  Brennan, nominated in an election year, was confirmed.

@DennisPCrawford @JohnJHarwood Yes, but by the narrow historical claim, that doesn’t apply because Kennedy was nominated in ‘87– the claim was nominated and confirmed. How that connects to the spirit of the larger claim about voters having their say is up for debate.

Hey @davidplotz were you so right about @MindingGapFilm . What a great, great film.

Simply being a sovereign, independent, nation has not always been a guarantor of peace in the world....
@adamslily But I was trying to leave optics out! I think the reason Iran Contra and Watergate are different is that there is not special knowledge at stake here or technical issues. Senators' questions will touch on basic societal issues about which constituents have a right to know.
The best argument then is that the hearing is about more than a set of facts in an evening. Broad issues are at play which affect their constituents. To remove Senators from the obligation of engaging with those issues is fundamentally at odds with representative government https://t.co/UgDE9ZpXgi

@ChasFlemming Agree 100%
Accepting your framing, if the parallel exists, this mindset is rather a bigger deal in a president, where ability to sublimate your personal desires, instincts and needs to the national call of the moment is a primary requirement of the job. Some have argued it’s the key one. https://t.co/zqqA4pdNyR
VP pence answer last time the question of moral equivalence with Russia came up: https://t.co/M4AxA59ndk https://t.co/bLICYLlLh2
with his intelligence officials. "Don't see any reason" is a disagreement with IC's total read on Russia &amp; Trump's own national security document: "actors such as Russia are using information tools in an a empt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies." https://t.co/Rnegf9s7ZC
Today the president said: "My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me, and some others; they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia...I don't see any reason why it would be." This is more than putting Putin's word on par 1/2
Paul Ryan said the president was engaging in moral equivalency with Russia. In February of last year the president was similarly accused on Russia. the Vice President responded this way: https://t.co/M4AxA59ndk https://t.co/tpGdRFFbMr
Ambassador Huntsman said purpose of summit was "to hold the Russians accountable for what they did." When asked in the press confernce whether Russians did anything wrong in past the president said "we're all to blame."

@chrislhayes Yes, and under ZT they're getting rejected under any circumstance. I was just trying to see if the numbers are available to tighten up that narrow corner of the story.
@chrislhayes If 6 in 1000 incidents of families crossing are not real families (based on government numbers) and those cases prompted the new policy, according to officials, what is the "cost" in valid asylum claims per 1000 that would have been denied as a result of new ZT policy?
How many asylum claims have been determined as valid at non points of entry in any recent pre-zero tolerance period?

@juliagriffin @RealHousewifeMD That's what makes it extraordinary that it was deployed!
Among the things that makes this episode extraordinary-- and different from travel ban, etc.-- is that the Attorney General and press secretary defended policy that forced family separation as supported by the Bible.
@wtsparrow agreed.
@JavierF_R Yes, essentially.
@Gallagher4NY I disagree! But then again, what if I didn't.
@JavierF_R I was thinking about the deterrent aspect, but presumably the courts would have acted pretty quickly, initiating move (with a court pretext) to separation. Ensuing fight would have been on firmer ground. Thinking of it with administration goals in mind, execution seems flawed
@monabenach and it lacks the deterrent aspect.
What if the administration had started first with the policy of this EO and let the courts force them afresh to either revert to catch and release or separating families?
@SkyMcKinley Understanding where new law and practice deviates from what came before helps me understand what is new. It's why @Dlind updating the story from 2014 was so helpful.

@IvanTheK I am going to figure out how to offer bundled content!
@IvanTheK I realize that these deals are also more than just content: Fox has overseas delivery systems that Comcast wants so that they can force the international audience to watch their content too.
@IvanTheK By the way: Thank you for helping me work this out when I'm sure you have something better to do with your morning.
@IvanTheK Scale player meaning what in this context? Someone with money to distribute, market and swamp consumers (you must watch this movie!) or scale in terms of I have the pipe and will front load this in your homes whether you like it or not. (Or both?)
@IvanTheK When Microsoft went from being a software co. to one that started competing for share of internet profits in early/mid 90s it wasn't because AOL had a better operating system (i.e. direct competition) it's that MS feared the OS &amp; software was shrinking -- wanted piece of new pie
@IvanTheK Another way to frame: There is a battle for content. Traditional creators like Disney are in the scrum and are now having to compete with companies from a different  part of the delivery food chain that want to get in on the action because their core product isn't as profitable.
@IvanTheK And going back to that original paragraph: Netflix isn't really a "threat" to a company if it operates a different business, is it? I mean, it's a move driven by pressures inside a company to find profits in greener pastures.
@IvanTheK I wish more reporting made that point. I keep hearing jargon. Companies like ATT and Comcast, who made money bringing content to the home can't keep making $ that way, so they have to start owning the content that comes through the pipe no matter what kind of pipe it is.
@IvanTheK But aren't I getting my internet connection through my cable box? (I mean, I actually am). But your point is that the pipe is no longer where the $ is at so everyone must become content creators?
Why is Netflix a threat to Comcast as this paragraph suggests? As the largest cable company isn't Netflix and all chord cutting giving Comcast more subscribers who are willing to pay higher fees for good content? https://t.co/T4GGtkLZy9

The president is very focused on tariffs. That's the standard against which his seriousness on other issues should be measured, right? So on immigration or school safety, for example, his focus and determination is what % of what it is on tariffs.  1/3

@FitzFox5DC @fox5dc Wow. That's neat. Thanks for posting that.
The Nunes memo may be a partisan document, but it lives or dies based on the strength of its content which must be assessed. This is a reason not to dismiss it out of hand. If you agree, read First sentence and substitute “Steele dossier” for “Nunes memo.” Discuss.
If the FBI wanted to take down candidate Trump why would it have fired Steele for successfully leaking information that was harmful to Trump? (Successful because Steele was not detected at the time) https://t.co/Z2aOtYbNfV
@thedawnwestlake @GOP What I said was accurate about the dossier, who funded Steele portion and why it was relevant re: FISA.
If the FBI wanted to use its tools to harm Donald Trump, what rank on the list of effective tools would be a FISA application 17 days before the election of a figure like Page?
...Especially since the memo in passage @davidafrench cites describes the agent who opened the Papadopoulos investigation as a leaker to the press who favored Clinton. https://t.co/bQMr15Xvjm
So if the memo confirms that and the FBI “deep state” knew about Papadopoulos for so long why, if the “deep state” was hell bent on keeping Donald Trump out of office, did the Papadopoulos News never get leaked? Didn’t FBI have Papadopoulos news for months before election? https://t.co/AuJ1gepfoq
@DraftRyan2016 That’s my hope.
@UltimateCrans I have proved that for 49 years.

@nycsouthpaw I read it as the former though in the current context I can see how some might have thought it was the latter.
@nycsouthpaw I assume b) is underway and not developed yet. Pointing out what SOP is and why DOJ IG is investigating this nevertheless would be helpful since presumably IG knows DOJ policy.
@nycsouthpaw Isn't your beef with the IG who is investigating on these grounds or are you saying the Post has it wrong and the IG isn't investigating.
@bradripka Is your argument is that the DOJ IG doesn't know DOJ policy?
@MissMaren5 I'm assuming there is sufficient deviation from DOJ policy for the DOJ IG to be interested in asking questions.
@dave_in_sa The piece says that's what the DOJ IG is looking into. It would be surprising if he was unfamiliar with DOJ policy.

Bob Dole was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal today. Here he is on his 1996 campaign plane talking to a reporter covering him who needs a haircut. https://t.co/SNvDaD2YAL https://t.co/IIblOiaLyJ
on a day @SenatorDole is being honored: “The naysayers, the nit-pickers may have a field day because the easy vote in this case is to find something you don't like and vote no. But we owe more to the American people than finding fault with what I consider to be a good agreement”
The @JohnLithgow play, Stories by Heart is so very good. Beautiful acting, storytelling, and personal intimacy that transport you from Michigan to Ohio to England so completely it should add miles to your frequent flier account.

@earldean71 Democrats opposed that legislation.
Good! I'm trying to think of others. NCLB in 2002 though that wasn't rose garden. https://t.co/VXKnTiwAJ1
When was the last time we had a bi-partisan signing ceremony in the Rose garden for a meaningful piece of legislation or agreement?

Senator Cotton said the president didn’t express that sentiment about groups no matter what word he used. https://t.co/EO5EEhSX4g
@markbecker26 @Honda I do.
A future Senate candidate focusing on the sentiment and not the word. https://t.co/cB3U1dPzFM

@darinbunch Good idea!
@darinbunch The point is that people think of mudslides as no big deal which is why they don't evacuate. That happened in this case. Changing the term might convey a greater sense of urgency.
Should we use a different term for this? Land avalanche? That’s not mud... https://t.co/FNisxoF7LG

The president suggested he didn't need to talk to Mueller because he believes there is no evidence of collusion, but 6/9 when the president said he was "100 percent" willing to testify, the question was about obstruction not collusion.

When I have in my life pushed the wrong button, I have an unbroken record of taking less than 38 minutes to say oops. So Hawaii button-pusher presumably didn't know he or she was the culprit?
