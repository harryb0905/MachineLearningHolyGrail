@KingJames did not show a ounce of hesitation on that shot!
Man... This game is too real!
Shane Battier!
Perfect time for a run...
That was BIG SHOT!
Lead changes and ties!
Tough finish KL!
Shoot it with confidence!
This is a game right here... High tempo .. Smart shots... Aggressive defense! On both sides...
Strong move @KingJames
Huge block by Wade!
Tough move Chalmers...
Turnovers are deadly...  They always come back to haunt you in close games.
Two nice plays made by Ray Allen. Both ending in assists.
“@DaJuice55: This game is butt ugly!!”--Little sloppy but now it's getting a letting rhythm.

DEFENSE ... Every time... When all else fails

@mrdowns22 no doubt! It definitely would. That would be like Dominique and Jordan. Power. High flying. #goodforthegame
@mrdowns22 yeah he is one of the best Dunkers hands down, same as Blake but those are up high down hard dunks. Not flashy and showman dunks
I do not see any advantage for lebron doing the dunk contest... Period.
Why is there so much controversy over #lebrondunks in warm ups? Do you think you would be impressed over those dunks in a dunk contest??
Good morning !
Short term memory and move on.. Sounds the easiest but is the hardest to do sometimes!
