@TheDeadRef @TalkJetsRadio @NFL @tpolamalu Had my rehearsal dinner there. Place is awesome
@njphones @NFL @tpolamalu So true
This is where the @NFL screwed the pooch. Pro Bowl after the Super Bowl is how it should be. You should want BOTH. I’ll never forget @tpolamalu walking in the hotel after winning the SB and coming to the PB. Pure joy on his face. ‘Twas the dream..... https://t.co/WKpsPzRTdr

@stocktoncollege This isn’t baseball so we shouldn’t try to copy it
@RonDufresne That’s probably true
@rrapp12_richard @kevinbyma Rules are there for a reason. It’s a players job to follow them
@jhud72 Good call
@SamTheSavior_ @johnnyshaw33 Gracias
@r0man04 But baseball lives in the tit for tat world. Football doesn’t. Home team always has the last chance in baseball
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 Hey-oh
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 But what if they both score a TD? When does it end?
@bschwartz07 @Soreechay14 I never get ugly
@NYJetsFan4life @nyjets Awesome thank you
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 Thank you!
@MJK_NY31 @ProFootballTalk I thought it was decent. Seems unfair if you score at the end of a half you shouldn’t get the ball to start a half. If we are playing the fairness angle
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 Again, and I’m beating a dead horse, if the defense does the job that it’s supposed to do, he would have gotten a chance....
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 And I think it’s fine as it is
@mattoharaa @Soreechay14 Himself
@MJK_NY31 Then what is your issue with me saying @ProFootballTalk’s article is dumb?
@bschwartz07 @Soreechay14 Master of your own destiny
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 Kickoff return team for both teams?
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 Yes, “fairness” 🙄
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 If KC stopped them and then kicked a field goal would that be a complete game?
@bschwartz07 @Soreechay14 Interesting
@80nygiants Also true
@johnnyshaw33 Very true
@MJK_NY31 You want KC to have the opportunity to get the ball. That’s against the rules. Therefore you are blaming the rules
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 Should we have 5 people attempt field goals to determine the winner?!?
@LouDesepoli YES!!!!
@CCGabriel1 https://t.co/O4DexptKAR
@SMullaney17 Exactly
@Soreechay14 @bschwartz07 What happens when both teams score a TD? Then what?
@kevinbyma Also a good point
@OdemTS https://t.co/AddnC9eRGg
@danbau76 But if we are all being fair shouldn’t the other team get the ball anyways....
@MJK_NY31 There were 11 guys in the field that could have taken care of that. They didn’t. Don’t blame the rules that everyone abides by
@bschwartz07 @Soreechay14 Facts
@MJK_NY31 Again, defense gets paid too. Maybe their conditioning should be better to stop a team in overtime?
@JimKaten If the defense trusts the offense to score, the offense trusts the defense to stop a team. Hence team sport
@MJK_NY31 It’s not but does it seem fair that the team who scores last gets the ball to start the 2nd half. We are taking “fairness” here
@blogvader 😬
This is dumb. Is it unfair if you win the coin toss at the beginning of a game and defer, then go and score at the end of the 1st half and then you receive at the beginning of the second half? Defense gets paid too https://t.co/rdm8s73hiS

Crazy how the world works. We were waiting in line on the runway delayed for 30 mins. A lady has a medical episode and we returned to the gate right away. If we had taken off on time it would have been much longer to get help. Great work by our @united crew &amp; first responders!
@hpjr Not with 4 kids. I’m on school schedule
@JayngoL I don’t think so but I guess crazier things have happened

@eugkim3 You’re correct. I’m on a plane
Adios Cleveland, thanks for the rain! Oh and maybe next time @joethomas73, I’m sure you just got busy......
@eugkim3 I stand out like a sore thumb
@ActionDomson Good luck!
@ClevelandNate @joethomas73 Why didn’t I think of that?
@gfLaughsAlot @joethomas73 Much better idea....
Wait, is this how you end up charging drinks to my room? #ProBowlFun https://t.co/3mT2iQ7V8M
@Katzy69 @joethomas73 Not that fancy
@Bcarp3 Not that there’s anything wrong with that
Listen @joethomas73, I’m in Cleveland but have a wedding to attend at 1:30. Any chance I can get an autograph sent to my hotel or do I have to be there in person? #Fan https://t.co/p8VJtQYJgy

@jmess15 Hahaha that’s awesome
@KelliLW If only
@BD40OSU No problem. Although it’s no Tommy’s
@raw1219 @FortniteGame I do not. I’ve got too many kids
@Grego19 @One30Three I’m still here. Haven’t gone anywhere
@AndreWade1 It’s terribly awkward. Especially since you don’t want to tell them who has the better pizza 😬
@MB_BackDoor Not until @pizzahut brings back the P’Zone.....
@JayHuested I think the same thing
@BubbaBranagan I enjoy everything
@Grego19 So awkward
@BD40OSU @BLTSteakNY for dinner. You won’t regret it
That awkward moment that you order from two different pizza places and they show up at the same time. #Yikes #Pizza https://t.co/bRq3cxnX0o

@TheRealS_NY #TwinkleToes
@JeffsBourbon Wait? What? Are you Big Brother......
Sooooo @pizzahut, where are we at with this P’Zone business? Asking for a couple of friends....
@chefjohngc Yup!
@francisbarstool See, I think all of this needs to be documented
@francisbarstool Of course! And I assume you’re always looking for content, so I say we should film it
@BigGrizz78 @TheRock I feel your pain

@Kaitlin_Doyle Totes
@BigDaddyAl1973 @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA Ha
@JoeJet13 @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA Never knew how much I enjoy it
@ChrisJ_owns @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA They’d probably apologize for getting in the way of my voice
@JordanLvsNYgrls @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA But of course
@BigDaddyAl1973 @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA I’ll do my best #USA
@frankiepapa Need to watch for a couple of minutes. Then I’ll be expert level....
@Sugalean @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA Twizzles are the best part
I love the olympics. It’s late and I should be going to bed but I am completely glued to free dance ice skating. Also, I’ve decided I’m an expert judge in about 5 minutes of watching. @NBCOlympics @TeamUSA #USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

@4JRutherford ooooo good idear
@Weatherford5 I'll allow it #judgesrule
Soooo it seems like this #MarchMadness pool should happen. Never done this before so let me work on the deets. One prize idea: signed jersey
Thinking of doing my own #MarchMadness pool and giving out Mangold/NYJ prizes to the winner. Any interest? #JETS
@T_R_Parks43 small world huh
@LTrainMEllis @David_Stan97 won't ask what?

@MikeNash15 depends on the time of year
So this is the #MarchMadness that everyone has been talking about. And here I thought it had something to do with college hoops....

@Phoenix_Jet I can't get less than 6'4" height though

@JaredKrieg with out being in person, probably pretty hard
@JaredKrieg unfortunately that might be a titch difficult

I truly believe that one of Dante's rings includes missing your connecting flight by 2 minutes. Plane is still there but you can't get on

Hanging with the fam and I just got schooled on the new xbox one. When did I get so old?!?!?

@DMBJimScott you did and I loved it. Don't fear the reaper was quite pleasant
@MaxwellJMangold @mang0ld well played
@deancurtis23 they're two different animals so I'm good
@EvanWhaley @mang0ld that's a shame
So @mang0ld directed a movie about my favorite X-Men, Wolverine. Do you think I'll get a non-related family member discount?
@BrianCoz @MikeSielskiWSJ might I be able to stay out of this?
@ChrisCarluccio @nyjets well put
@B_Laird @katiebeannn it's really not that hard, I swear

@Rybean80 I assume other animals would enjoy it as well
@Sasloe once and it was turrrible
@caseypurple really? That's quite moving
@Henkus life has become quite busy lately
@ChipotleTweets it's a shame he can't talk more. I think he'd come up with a good bag story
@Sasloe no, I really am that bad
@r_rhendrickson looking forward to it
@Henkus you have too high of standards?
@Sasloe @AmonAmarthBand unfortunately I have zero rhythm
@SarahTeresa hmmm perhaps
My son asked for "black beans, chicky, rice, tomato, and chippies". Clearly my love of @ChipotleTweets has rubbed off on him. #toddlerquotes
@caseypurple sorry for your loss
@MaggiDe haha that's awesome. I hope all is well

It's that time again, I'll be tied to my phone for 15 mins if you want to ask a question #coldtubtweet
Tix are still available for purchase for the #JETS Taste of the NFL event tomorrow night if you want to join the fun! http://t.co/G9RgLpXv
For those that claim they answered before the winner, I am going off my phone's timeline. So if there's a complaint, talk to twitter
We have a winner! Congrats and thanks to everyone who guessed! “@sharpiebro: @nickmangold 86”
Contest question: What is my best score for a round of golf? Hint: it's under 100. Remember, first one who correctly answers, wins. GO!
Contest for tix to the #JETS Taste Event will be a "first to answer" type question and I will tweet the question at 5:55pm eastern.
FYI, tomorrow night is the #JETS Taste of the NFL event and since it's a ticketed event, I say we have a contest! http://t.co/t2iRsfp6
