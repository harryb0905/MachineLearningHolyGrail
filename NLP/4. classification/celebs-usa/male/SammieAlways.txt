Ok now back to sleep I go. Don’t wanna be the sleepy guy in the gym. I love y’all.
Nah, I’ve learned that when I awake in these hours there’s two things I’m to do, pray, and then be a minister to those who need some light fed to them. I’ve done both. https://t.co/aXVWoitdm6
Never make impulsive or emotional decisions. There’s no logic when in that realm or space. Center yourself always then proceed to greatness.
I smile and still mingle with my enemies. Sounds fake, but no...it’s called adaptation. Enemies will and can help you if you play your cards right. Keep them close and note who they truly are and act accordingly!
Ladies and gents, let go of any and all hatred that dwells within your heart. That ex was a lesson, that lay off was a lesson, that let down was a lesson. Learn it, apply what it is you’ve learned and become beautiful from it.
I’ve been lied on, till this day...however I bask in truth. I’ve been manipulated, now I pray for discernment and I still trust. We all have a choice on how we react to unfortunate mishaps and set backs in our lives. Bounce back!
Hurt people don’t hurt people. People who choose to convey hurt, hurt people. Stop using your past as an excuse to be a toxic person. I’ve been hurt, and I became a healer instead. People have stolen from me, that birthed a giver out of me.
Welp let me drop my daily knowledge on y’all real quick, then ima try this “go back to sleep” thing again.
Up and @ em early. This is what I get for going to sleep before 11pm smh.
See y’all in 2019 💙✌🏾. Send all inquiries to @lopskino lol.   #YoungLion #SA @ Atlanta, Georgia https://t.co/YYcEg7YEUh
Aye, I don’t know who needs to read this but ima be “taken” pretty soon. I can feel it. And I’m 31 so this time a ring and babies comes with the deal. Speak ASAP or forever hold your peace...😬
Slept wrong last night, my neck is killing me. 😩. And I worked out smh 🤦🏾‍♂️. I need a spa!
Just don’t lie to me.
Stop fronting!
Gym was therapeutic this morning, who all worked off those Thanksgiving meals???
#BeGreat works, be kind. Be purposeful. Have a blessed and a grand rising 2u all. Peace, light and love.
Sometimes it’s good to write things down about yourself. Things you fancy and the things you’re continually working on. Day in and day out. I suggest to my followers to proudly follow suit! Let’s help each other be better world! Love y’all. 💙
I will continue to kill my demons, so that I, myself can see my light, be a light and exude Godliness throughout the Earth.
I’ve taken every obstacle and barricade head on, and because of God’s mercy &amp; grace I’ve become triumphant! I’m a champion. I cannot lose. I will handle adversity with my head held high and with a heart full of faith and hope and BELIEF!
I love the man I’ve become and am becoming although I once was a boy with childish ways. I’ve learned from my mishaps, my poor decisions, and I stopped giving myself excuses a long time ago. I’ve forgiven myself for my past transgressions.
I believe in being honest, even when it hurts. Knowing that sometimes I can drive people away by doing so. But knowing that they have to respect my decision to do so is where I find peace. I refuse to live a lie.
I sing secular music. However I’m in love and in tuned with Elohim. I believe in cleansing and detoxing however I indulge in liquor from time to time I just don’t abuse it. I’m passive when need be but ultimately I’m a lion and aggressive about mine!
Now #LakeShow
#GoBucs
Be kind, or karma won’t.
3. Know that the Lord is aware of your calamity.
When Life Seems Broken Beyond Repair Psalms 34:15-18  1. The Lord is aware of your circumstances.  A. He sees you.  B. He hears you.  2. Know that Lord is aware of your conflict.  A. He reprimands your enemy.  B. He removes the memory.

Madden 19’ has the most glitches I’ve ever experienced in Madden history lol. My meter doesn’t come up when I kick field goals. I can’t control my WR to aggressively catch etc etc lol.

Power of the tongue. Be mindful of what you speak.
I also vocal arrange myself &amp; sequence my projects. - I guess what I’m trying to say is don’t compare me, and if you do...compare me to the younger me. That is all.
When it comes to my pen, I’m lethal with it &amp; I add a dab of cleverness always. I’m actually a singer/ songwriter so we’re clear.

And even if you sign a deal. Don’t expect the label to do all the work, it’s not going to happen. Champion yourself first, create a buzz...then they’ll put you on the calendar. Believe in yourself. Invest in yourself. See the vision all the way thru.
Technology has now given the artist their careers in the palms of their hands (literally.) So no excuses. Do the work. Create something dope. Develop a grass root/ cult following. The world will catch on when it’s time.
I was forced to the internet back in 09 before the business became internet driven. Back when https://t.co/gLiH9Z3A2m and https://t.co/NS9dL77sGm and limewire was a thing. So now, with IG/ Twitter/ Facebook and SnapChat I know how to move my product and content.
If you’re blessed to have the digital game on smash and radio and television, that’s awesome. However, the internet is all you truly need to make a wave 🌊 in this industry.
And then ultimately the goal is to tour, stay booked, move merchandise &amp; if you write or/ and produce your own music your publishing and royalties &lt;&lt;&lt; (which isn’t much in MOST cases also play its role).
The key for all artist is to accumulate a dedicated community of listeners via these digital platforms which then equates to a plethora of streams. Once the music is out, the way to extending the life of the project is thru imagery, videos, vlogs etc.
Let me put the trolls on game. You no longer have to have a radio smash to be relevant or to win in this industry. The music is free damn near. $9.99 to any DSP and you have your favorite artist(s) catalog. The game has changed.
Grateful 💙🤗 https://t.co/u1wLgv7Zbt

Can’t lie, it’s warming my heart to see you all embrace y’all’s natural glow. Truly. A fan asked for a pic the other day &amp; I obliged of course &amp; the first thing she said was “let me put on this filter, I look a mess.” But she looked amazing as is.

Two years ago I had a choice to allow a viral video to be just that, or I could use that moment to rebirth my career. Well in this genre of r&amp;b I’ve charted #5, #2, &amp; #1. To think some looked at me crazy when I said I’m here to save r&amp;b.
And I smashed four covers this year just for y’all to marinate on. I’ve written close to 20 new records since Sept of last year once I got off tour with Tank for my next album. It’s almost time to get back to work. An exciting time.
It’s been over a year since I’ve recorded for myself album wise. I recorded two fresh records to complete my ep 31873.0 released earlier this year. And thanks for the #1 spot on the r&amp;b charts when that dropped on my bday.

And no matter how successful you become, remain humble and with a grateful spirit! You can lose it all in the blink of an eye!
Exude love, integrity, ethics, and morals throughout your journey. Great Character beats talent. Relationships are clutch to have. You’ll get a lot of opportunities based off knowing the right people.
The worst thing you can do is compare your journey to someone else’s. God’s written your story uniquely designed for yourself. Embrace it, enjoy the ride and grow and become beautiful from the hardship. There’s a happy ending to your story. Have faith!
During your season of struggle, agony and pain...it is imperative to learn the lesson in it all. All things are by design whether you understand it at the time or not. Stay razor sharp and keep your head held high.
If you quit today, who’s to say that tomorrow wasn’t gonna be your breakthrough? You’ll never know if you stop chasing the Dream.
“Keep in mind that you can’t run into your destiny if you stop running.”
It’s ok to grow at a slow and steady pace. Most people want results right now. And life simply doesn’t work that way. As long as you’re taking steps forward towards your goal each day you are moving in the right direction.
Haven’t done a twitter rant in quite some time...so here goes.

And I got @AppleMusic - Jay Z &amp; Bey I need that. Thanks. Signed: Sammie.
I wish I could give my honest opinions on these albums but the way social media and politics set up, ima chill 😎. But I will say CHILL with the tweets for rt’s. Digest the music and be real about it.
I can only stomach beer, red wine and gin and tonic 😋.
•Tequila specifically PATRON / we broke up on my 21st in Miami. •Vodka - left that in my early 20’s makes me sick. Sad to announce me and •Hennessy are separated (to be continued...) 😞

Respect the era. Don’t compare.  Kobe is my Michael Jordan  Usher is my Michael Jackson...doesn’t mean they are better, I grew up in a time where I witnessed more Kobe and Usher simple and plain. Stop disrespecting legacy and those who paved the way.

Singer/ songwriter/ entertainer. Birthed in 1999 - still going. 🙏🏾.
No shade to artist who go that route for the look in hopes to propel themselves forward. Use it. Flourish. I’m just speaking on myself!
Plus I’ve spent a lifetime making SAMMIE mean something. I’d be pissed if that was tarnished and I was deemed as only a “reality star.”
If I did reality tv, it would have to be about my life &amp; music career. It would have to be real.
&lt;&lt;&lt; Denied reality TV on about 4/5 occasions. Always knew my gift &amp; work ethic would spring me back to success. Never beef’d for views or dated someone to elevate. I’m just not wired that way.

Oh and last night was another sold out affair. Thank you Kansas City for rocking with me. My Lioness looked angelic in their all white last night. Chicago, up next.
With that being said, I’m as humble as they come. I’m wired that way, and God requires it. However don’t think I’ll ever be that guy to go back and forth in my DM’s - I utilize my energy in a more fruitful way. The block button is my go to!
So she’s been blocked. Idc if she doesn’t stream, purchase or support another show of mine. I’ll always be fine 🙏🏾.
Then she continued to dm me, how I brought negative energy to the show by having that girl around me. And she specified race also which exudes hate and I too don’t fancy that behavior.
Had a fan dm me that she’s disappointed because I’m a God fearing man, who had a girl in my section last night that she doesn’t like 😑. First of all, I don’t know you and who you don’t like isn’t my business (Idc) who you don’t like.
I have zero tolerance for negativity - I  try and show love sometimes via DM’s but once my kindness is taken advantage of I have no choice but to block out the noise. So you’re BLOCKED.
Kansas City showed dumb love!
This has been the case for quite some time now. https://t.co/UTrVR3n52o

Y’all she just sent me “😉, good game 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾”... ~ what is she talking about 😩😭😔?
She said “you know what Sammie, don’t worry about using my number and don’t worry about coming to Chicago either” - I’ve never replied to this woman in my life 😩! What r u talking about? lol. &amp; who r u talking to? lol.
It’s actually quite a few of these kind. It’s one thing to keep shooting your shot, it’s another to look like a looney toon in the process.
There’s a woman in my DM’s (who has whole conversations with herself, I’ve never opened it nor replied and each day she gets angrier about it. And replies as though I’ve replied 🤦🏾‍♂️😩. ) Lordt help her.
