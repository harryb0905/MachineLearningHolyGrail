@ThePerezHilton Caleb is one of my best friends. can’t tell you how inspiring it is to see him so positive after such an incident. He’s used it to appreciate things more and has somehow made a crazy situation into a positive. We could all learn a lot from him. &lt;3

I want to give a special shoutout to two people as well. @MitchyCollins wrote this song with me and it wouldn’t be the same without his talent, both on the guitar playing side, and the creative side. he gave this song so much life and color.
not sure i’ll ever be able to top this one. link below. give it a chance. everyone could use a love song. #206ActII https://t.co/Btd5IuHiBw
sometimes you feel like you spend your entire life building, working, crafting, creating, perfecting, failing, giving, and walking towards one single moment where you finally go... “wow. i think this is it. this is the moment. this is what all of that was for”. that is “Coffins”.

@natateaaa 😂😂
@NathanSykes Aww so sweet of you to say 😂
here is the link to help the Guatemalan people: https://t.co/M0GXqWbY5I
due to the recent Volcanic eruptions. We need to help. Many can’t afford to leave their homes and others have lost all that they have. Here is a link that explains situation and has links and offers ways for you to help in many different ways. Donating clothes, money, or just &lt;3
so much is going on in the world right now but one really affecting me is what’s happening in Guatemala. Some of the most kind and compassionate people I have met recently are from this beautiful country and they are going through hard times and the loss of many lives (1/2)
“its like everyone who gets it is bailing the earth”.
“As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you. Most of the time, those marks — on your body or on your heart — are beautiful. Often, though, they hurt."
This one really affected me. Super happy I am with my family today.
Save me a spot at the bar up there @Bourdain. we have stories to tell. https://t.co/tPc17jQ0BU
Sending my love to Anthony’s daughter and family. To his friends. To all of the people his life touched and affected. If you need help or know someone who needs help DO NOT BE AFRAID TO SAY SOMETHING. Life is as intricate as a spider web and as fragile and delicate as one too. &lt;3
Many of us travel to find answers. To find peace. To find tbe piece missing from within ourselves. A void. A darkness. I guess you never found that, Anthony. But I hope you have now. Thank you for inspiring me and for showing me to live with courage and sarcasm.
I imagined us talking about Rock and Roll... the interesting characters we had met across our travels... places we have yet to see... and how this crazy world has impacted us. Now I’ll never be able to.
We were in Florence at the same time a few weeks ago and I remember saying at dinner how cool it would be if he was at the same restaurant as us because it would be a dream to be able to pick his brain over his dinner.
Anthony. Bourdain. No. No. No. that man is one of the reasons I picked a suitcase and started traveling the world. He made me curious. He made me hungry. I knew he had a rough early life and it made me think that traveling the world could cure anything and be medicine.

crazy how many friends come out of the woodwork and support you and your passions when you least expect it and how incredible that feels and how many completely disappear when you need them most. people are walking plot twists.

@2desi2function It’s a continuation of Act I.
@AdriEliQueen Act II.
@davebarnesmusic Did not expect you to see that 🙈
@iconicvampires Loved.
I also feel the first songs talk about how these times affected ME.. and ”Better Than Me” was when I was in my head on how they affected the ones I loved the most and those around me. https://t.co/1a0nRAiDFx
You know.. I think lyrically it does. The album speaks of falling into darkness and wrestling with the definition of life and death. Demons stand tall. Sometimes you don’t want your shadows to block the light of those around you. https://t.co/1a0nRAiDFx
@kaylawinkler &lt;3
@waItersparks MF will be.
@itssanairam Marry Jo.
@themarzipan I step off of the plane.
@jwebmusic Oh man. There’s a few on Miguel’s new album. Some on “Pineapple Skies”. JT does a run on the live version of “Drink You Away” that’s just plain stupid.
@FallingAway9 I wouldn’t want to be a bad influence. :)
@itssimplyshane The same person that was behind “Her Love Is My Religion”. Ha

@unl0stt Right now I’ve got Malawi, Japan, Dominican Republic, Italy, and Norway coming up.
@valerinashoes “Tearin’ Up My Heart”- *Nsync
@2desi2function @KatieLynnFehr I’ve always said Bohnes is a natural progression from The Cab. A lot of the same bones. (No pun intended)
@hellxxn Hmm.. maybe Capetown?
@opulentmiracles All of them are snapshots. Just all from different days and moments.
@TheChosenPun That’s the plan. A double vinyl release that includes both Act I and Act II.
@BradleighWrites “set fire to the roses on my grave”.
@hellxxn “Better Than Me”. just a heart-wrenching situation.
@SensitiveSolo Absolutely. My favorite ballad is on Act II.
@pameziliotto There is no dream too big.
@2desi2function How she is so openly fragile yet so damn strong all at once. What a beautiful quality.
@bertinmeshita Coco and Up.
My own. It was the first time I really focused on me loving it more than anyone else. I didn’t need outside validation like I always craved before. This one was for me and the fans.. No one else. https://t.co/ux0CkXfdZe
@KatieLynnFehr insecurity.
@calumnliam FOOD. IN MY BELLY. NOW.
@KatieLynnFehr I freestyled “Better Than Me”. took about 20 minutes. “12 Rounds” kept shape-shifting and taking on new forms etc so that one probably took the longest.
@HeatherMoser26 You are a sweetheart. Thank you.
@aking4366 Jo’s are on Act II.
@awkmen Changes daily. “Mosh pit” or “better than me” right now.
I wanted to be like my dad. I also played basketball in high school and got good grades so I didn’t want to drink and party on weekends with everyone else. I wanted to be ready for games and practice so I wrote songs while everyone was out instead. I always had something to say. https://t.co/4pgn0rVBwS
for all of you early birds... let’s do a quick Q&amp;A. ask me anything you want. make ‘em good!

@RyanFollese You know what’s next...
Didn’t seem like that many people wanted to hear it 😝 https://t.co/PfPFl3FQTU
holy shit Game Night was SO funny.
Not sure why I’m telling you this right now.. but like I said... it was tights. #the90s
True story.. when I was a kid I went to every store in town and took every single AOL 4.0 demo disc from the display stands until I had about a thousand. I then glued all them on every inch of space on the walls in my room and lived in a disco ball for a few years. It was tight.
@skriversfreak He literally is me. Favorite Disney movie
@americanair will you guys please check your dm’s from me 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I hate when people get their “to”, “too”, and “two”’s wrong and I just did it on accident. 😑
the song I may post a clip too later today was written with @MrHudson.. one of my all time favorite dudes. definitely different than any other song on the album... any guesses on what song it is?
Should I post another new song preview from my debut album “206-Act I” on instagram right now? 💀🤔
Chicken noodle or butternut squash? https://t.co/KmX6q1FZZj
@idkbrooooke Do it!
@AsToldByErika Probably 8 pm
@AmericanAir do you foresee flights tomorrow morning out of New York City being cancelled or is there still a chance they will leave?
@MikeSheaAP @TheGunzShow Is there a bar?
@saycliche March 24th
@TheGunzShow Bro I’m about to fly (try to fly) in today and out tomorrow morning 🤦🏻‍♂️
Woah. You are an absolute legend. 🙌🏻💀😳 https://t.co/Yg77L5rTqD
@TheFunkyAinoer Man! These aren’t even the best guitar jams!! one of these will be on the album. Act II. however you’re going to FLIP over “Slither” and “Mosh Pit”!
Artists would be nothing without our fans. Have to give back somehow. crucial and v important. https://t.co/XFtoGB4cji
@sara__zero Just write and tell us you can’t come
@sara__zero Just buy the bundle and decline party invite. Easy. :)
@bellaxmeghan Pre-order the album on my site and you should be there!
Gosh he is just so good and so cool. https://t.co/WTArtFm7te
@FallingAway9 If you order one now you’ll be good!
Make sure you pre-order soon so you get in 💀🙌🏻 https://t.co/XocD33qdKm
in case you missed it.. Throwing a listening party where I’ve hired tattoos artists to give select Bohnes tattoos.. play full album.. q&amp;a etc. events are in LA and NYC. to come all you have to do is preorder album for less than $10 on https://t.co/i10Z1Phpao
@Danielita89 @BridgetteAlexis NYC March 24th
@lonely8123 Early evening or evening
@Lucy_Landry Come hang so we can catch up
This is a great idea... https://t.co/l4e8auUDuV
@whatthekell_ Should be evening
@darlenycaba What part hahahah
@kcvuyk Should be flash
@AirialChristine Why can’t you come!? 😭
Absolutely! no one is forced to get tattoos. just an option I wanted to give people. I really wanted an extra layer of connection to my fans by getting a matching tattoo with them! https://t.co/h6og8VuUTT
@caseybonilla There is a bundle for guaranteed tattoos but other will Be first come first serve after those who got that bundle finish :)
@nicolefrunza Not a vinyl yet! that’s coming! It’s a hand signed and number-lithograph!
Was really important to make all of the pre-sale bundles affordable and to not upcharge. I know how hard you work for your money and it’s about having a moment with you guys and experiencing joy with all of you not about making money. Appreciate that you choose to support my art.
hey guys.. so spots to the listening parties and tattoo spots are going faster than anticipated so if you want to hang in LA or NYC I would pre-order the album on my site ASAP. Some bundles GUARANTEE spots to get Bohnes tattoos. https://t.co/i10Z1Phpao
Pre-order the album on https://t.co/i10Z1Phpao https://t.co/h7nNmCtEKS
the Bohnes tattoos/listening parties will be on the following dates:  Los Angeles: March 11th  New York City: March 24th  We will have a flash sheet of small Bohnes-inspired tattoos. Have to keep them small in order to get to as many people as possible.
If I have to.... https://t.co/LVJZBracu6
@MattInRealLife 🤚🏻 https://t.co/obaxjWw9kf
@LKissell2014 @mariahshevchuk I dare you
to come to the BOHNES listening/tattoo/hang/Q&amp;A party all you have to do it pre-order the album on my website https://t.co/CY5ojc9z2J

@ana_fournon Just pre-order it like normal. It’s $9.99 and it’s okay if you can’t come to party :)
more info coming shortly. doing this mostly because plain and simple.. I just miss you guys. Best fans in the world.   NYC and LA.. who is going to try to come!?
@mariahshevchuk Could be......
all you have to do is sign up for The Coffin Club on https://t.co/CY5ojc9z2J to be put in the raffle for spots. Space is limited. some packages come with guaranteed Bohnes tattoo session with artist and I. the rest will be first come first serve. pre-order album to enter raffle !
I will also be playing the album for the first time.. both Act I and possibly Act II if enough of you join me. There will me limited merch available..  exclusive signed and numbered lithographs and exclusives.. a Q&amp;A.. stories behind the songs.. and epic hangs.
I’m throwing two parties. One in Los Angeles. One in NYC. I’m hiring some of my favorite tattoo artists and I’m getting tattooed with my fans (yep I’m getting some too). Hiring the artists for hours to get as many of you guys guys inked as possible.💀💀
I would be absolutely nothing with you guys. My dreams wouldn’t have come true.. This album wouldn’t exist.. and I wouldn’t be the happy guy that I am without @TheCab fans and the current Bohnes fans.. So here’s what I’ve got....
hey guys. i can’t believe my debut album is finally coming out. feeling an overwhelming amount of happiness. i wanted to do something awesome for you guys as a thank you for the undying support and patience with the music...

Damn right. https://t.co/w9LA09m5Sy
You won’t regret it. gotta get out to see in. https://t.co/MSb6o3cfy6
@ayrtonmcgurgan @AltPress Gotta get out to look in, my friend.
@cassialva 🤫
@_ceggers Me = everyday
Hmm... would any of you come? 🤔 https://t.co/A52xt4o76b
@RocioMonteros_ I did another for “six feet under” :)
@natateaaa @thenbhd @5SOS Would be a dream. What you say @Ashton5SOS and @Luke5SOS :)
@tddylupin YES!
@signemendes A few :)
@iamdavebriggs Too much
“moshpit”. https://t.co/Ad1dW4dwqq
@OMJItsRachel Yep. Last minute decision.
@ltsGabbie I would say Paris and Rome.
@bohneschile Doing it without my family which was called @TheCab. Those were some of the most talented guys I’ve ever written with and worked with so it’s like playing a solo sport as opposed to a team competition. isolation and loneliness is important in life yet terrifying all at once.
@CheesierToast Nope! The second half will be all different songs as well. Acoustic EP will be a whole different/separate release.
@amonkee @TheCab Literally everything. It’s my vision not five visions. It’s who I am..  not who we are. just a complete different experience and message.
“Coffins”. Best song I’ve ever written and most real. About Jo and I. https://t.co/xfK0Gw4LkP
It would be a dream to have a double vinyl package. Going to try to make that happen. https://t.co/EDEnWxKiMs
@sarinnne Love and appreciate you as always. &lt;3
@Georgina_Dolan Every song can be drastically different but the two weigh nearly the same.. a ballad on each, a few mids, uptempos, rock and roll...  but lyrics tie it all together.
@anarchytilldawn Life is a book and all chapters are equally as important. I loved being in The Cab. I loved the people in The Cab.. but right now I have to see this through for myself. It’s where and who I am in life at the moment. It’s 100% me.
@kimbolasko We’ll see if I remember how to do this. :)
There is no doubt in my mind. https://t.co/GRH88YYezt
@AninhaSBu Eight. 16 total.
@goldenqueer And @GregorioPhoto took all of the unreal photographs.
@goldenqueer My friend Mathew Moore. @m.s.moore on instagram. He is legendary.
@itssanairam Abandoned buildings are the “bones” of what the used to be. The life has been sucked out of them but they have a story to tell.
@sopheerose It felt right. I think the half and half will be really special. I kind of see a movie or a play when i listen to the album and two “acts” felt right. It also gives each song a bit more time to shine and not get lost.
They’ll be coming every Friday if you’re a Coffin Club member which is free at https://t.co/CY5ojc9z2J 💀⚰️♣️ https://t.co/04MYowh4Yk
Together they make one album. Releasing it in two halves and the second should come out a few months after the first. It’s all apart of the same story.. two acts with an intermission in between. https://t.co/8j7124LF9N
remembering what it feels like to be inspired. https://t.co/90greHHTy2
206 is the number of bones in the adult human body. it represents who you are. under the masks you wear.. under your circumstances.. who are we as people underneath it all? we live in a world where everything is overly dressed up. https://t.co/plWeDVniXh
@paintingducks It definitely has a specific order. A few songs follow and/or relate to each other story/lyric wise so I always keep that in mind. Albums need a strong beginning, middle, and end.
Since Act I/the first part of the album is officially coming out on March 30th and is called “206”.. let’s do a Q&amp;A right now!   hit me with anything about the album/tracklisting/project!   will answer my favorites and follow a few of you with the best questions. ! https://t.co/U1yWzxYWWz
@MikeSilver I’m a two dotter myself..
guitar player recommendations have been great. keep them coming. putting together a crazy band. such a guitar lovers/guitar heavy album. you ready @iamdavebriggs ?

@chelseanice My favorite place!
any friends in Kauai? What a magical place.
@l0singteeth @xoSnapple Honestly just thankful you guys ever supported me at all. No matter the timeframe. thankful you ever even cared at one point at all even if you don’t anymore. Wouldn’t be where I am without people like you. Grateful for you both.

@RyanFollese I know a good driveway for sledding and tubing
grew up with my dad always showing me his favorite artists, albums, and songs. “no need to argue” was one of his favorites.. and became one of mine. Dolores was a chunk of the soundtrack to my childhood. will never forget singing “Zombie” at the top of my lungs with my pops/her. https://t.co/AeesaedyOp

@VicTafur Aren’t we all sitting at the pew with that same prayer? :)
@LGonzo1026 @VicTafur I think so too. but we may be desperate. Ha
@VicTafur Eli Apple a possibility? Reggie doesn’t like bad characters but maybe a second chance and reunion with Conley/our desperation?
@itssanairam Haha not upset at all :)
I just face-palmed my forehead so hard I have both a bruise and a concussion. https://t.co/uEHprCyRh1
@itssanairam Definitely has correlation. When I get anxiety I eat shitty food and he’s a great singer so I got anxious and nervous and at this point name dropping is completely pointless because no one cares that I saw someone famous at airport haha
Think I just saw @samsmithworld at the airport and almost started singing to him while he rode away on his cart but then realized I had one too many margaritas and would probably be flat so I went and ate McDonald’s instead.
@emilysuprenant @RAIDERS Yasssssss queen
That’s why I created second versions for the songs. &lt;3 https://t.co/AGulfHUf42

@shaymitch Join @JosephinSkriver and I in Antarctica.
I can say with 100% certainty @JosephinSkriver is one of the 53. I’ve personally seen her watch it 7 times. https://t.co/9s6sIZJC7K
if there was a hidden camera in my house and people could see how ridiculously I dance on my own and sing along to “pineapple skies” by @Miguel I would have zero friends. (or a lot more friends?)

They will always be faster than you, so it’s better to have them on your team than to try to run from them or outlast them. They don’t sleep. https://t.co/RmUZdCxZoE
Most people attempt to ostracize their demons which leaves them room to come back with a vengeance. This song is about shaking hands with them, getting to know them, and giving them a tip of the hat.
this, exactly! I’m glad you understand where I was coming from when I wrote this. https://t.co/Wpw1Zb2Za5
The “My Friends” Video will be available worldwide tomorrow! https://t.co/FmXNASZjAl

BEAST MODE!!!! I CAN SMELL FIRST PLACE!!! @RAIDERS
who has listened to my newest song!? very proud. blood, sweat, and tears went into this one. wrote it when I felt like everyone stopped believing in me and was wrestling with my thoughts and demons. https://t.co/Qdtpk8N05J
your dad is a legend. https://t.co/SaC0IAziE5
@natateaaa @ariamariax I remember this. After 1D MSG show
@andrewtothemoon Not to mention.. You read the fine print? they just opened up Alaskan national parks to oil drilling as well to get final votes.
ever been so tired your eyes burn even when they’re shut?
Thank you my brother. just want to grow up and be able to sing like you. https://t.co/EOBzXHxMul
well.. @ChrisStapleton just came out with a new album. no one call, text, or talk to me for at least 19 days. tell my mom I love her. Bye.
thank you Ian Hays for writing it and @catherinepowell for the beautiful photographs and letting me be apart of this. HERE IS THR STORY: https://t.co/J98437KX5N https://t.co/Q3FUVdA1zF
and who’s writing understood me and my values/outlook to the core. this is by far my favorite story ever on me.. as it feel it is authentic, accurate, and devastatingly well-written. if you want to know who i am and what my new music project is... this is how to step inside. https://t.co/J7zrPmDF72
today @NKDmag released their new issue and there is a profile on me in it. i’m going to be honest.. most interviews are the same. same questions. same answers. redundancy. never have i had someone write a profile on me that was so deeply in touch with who i am (1/2) https://t.co/puNEQfoi40
@Nomad052 I am. Covers included :)
the words were too real and painful not to. enjoy seeing the world through my eyes for a few minutes. run your fingers through my mind. “MY FRIENDS ACOUSTIC” OUT NOW!! https://t.co/TV4vHOmN8B https://t.co/RZAFUkAKjJ
songs are stories. they go from an artists’ lips to your ears. they tell of pride and pain. of love and loss. you can hear the pages of the story in the cracks of their voice. it was important for me to release a version of this song with just my voice and a guitar.
Teach me how to be immortal https://t.co/AEp7MFyXE0
Thank you! So proud of this https://t.co/AQLc34m15T
for all of the night owls on the east coast.. Looks like “My Friends” Acoustic version is out 💀😈😈😈
@sarahheyyy going to be Miguel from “Coco” for Halloween next year. 💀
@sarahheyyy Yep.
“Coco” just became my favorite Pixar movie with “Up”. Can relate to it so much. A young Mexican boy (I’m Mexican) plays music and turns into a skeleton. My Mexican grandma was also a singer and my best friend and cousin was named Dante. 😱😱😱💀💀💀😭😭😭🙌🏻🙌🏻💀
Appreciate you. https://t.co/IHlJB3fDWn
released a new song last week and it’s one of my favorites. rock and roll with a hip hop beat and pop hook. Check out if you can. Would mean the world. 💀🙌🏻🙂https://t.co/jOgGmrL7e2

@sunskriver the song is about Las Vegas and that is it’s area code. &lt;3
@FaithPaulyDemiJ do whatever the hell makes you happy because this is it. this is the one life you’ve got. these are the cards you’ve been dealt. so jump.
@DerekWalkney all we can do is remain honest, authentic, and humble and hope that they remember why they fell in love with you in the first place. (2/2)
@DerekWalkney it’s not easy. the world will be against you. you’ll piss people off. you’ll be scared. that’s for sure. (1/2)
@CaylaMarie you should never do anything in life because “everyone is doing it”. in fact.. doing the opposite usually leads down a road to success.
a bit of both. death is beautiful because it forces you to live. if we lived forever there would be no need for urgency. urgency is key. https://t.co/O5NIhT1oGU

@JLynch46 then I️ pick up a guitar or sit at piano and start singing to figure out which chords and notes convey the emotion I️ felt while writing it.
@JLynch46 I️ used to write melodies first because that part was the easiest for me.. But lately been starting songs with a single line or concept.
@emilysuprenant LOVE IT! hahahah
@folk_katie After you leave certain places you’ll never be the same. They transform you. through people, sights, sounds, tastes.. you become brand new
@folk_katie my favorite places have been Antarctica, Iceland, and Rome. my favorite part about it is that each place steals apart of you for life.
@JazzTColes That would be an understatement.

@zimmo33 I write every single song but did a few with friends of mine.
@unpredictacal I had something to sing about again.
@kelseyishername as an artist you want to inspire others. when you inspire others you feel inspired. when you feel as if no one's listening it's hard to sing
@Tori_Ohhh stella and tequila
@nicolefrunza hoping to see my mama.
@gigimyfeels the next single will come out in a few weeks. :) a complete new song and remixes and acoustic versions of that one as well.
@meIaphobia if enough people like the music I will tour.
let's do a quick Q&amp;A. ask me anything about the new project/music/songs. would love to hear your questions.
at least I hope they do.
I have a feeling a lot of people that loved @TheCab will dig the acoustic versions of all of these new songs.
acoustic song is also out on all platforms now too. Apple Music, Spotify etc. all of the links can be found here 💀👊🏻 https://t.co/E9ynHWUNtt

NEW SONG ALERT! thanks @huffpost for debuting my new acoustic single for “six feet under”! https://t.co/u3jOnBQMLp https://t.co/FuCGvPHi1Q
you know... i was going to release the acoustic version of “six feet under” tomorrow.. But maybe I should do it today? what do you think?💀
the “white privelage” mentality truly is sickening and if you are in my life and have any ounce of it... you can see your way out.
as if Puerto Rican’s aren’t going through enough right now.. they have to deal with this? what is wrong with people?
by the way.. the person they said “looked like a terrorist” here at the airport is from Puerto Rico.
well.. hate to break it to them but i am going to profile them by saying “YOU LOOK LIKE ASSHOLES”.
then just now i overhear a white couple talking about a person in line in front of us saying they “look like a terrorist”.
watched my friend who is Indian get stopped repeatedly by theme park guards and tormented by them this week for no reason other than race.
racial profiling makes me sick.
I think I’m a baseball fan again after last night. What a game.
@AirialChristine sure!
man, life is really incredible isn’t it?
broke into an abandoned funeral home and shot a video for an acoustic version of “six feet under”. song and video out friday. https://t.co/nYJ4f0fKSE

so excited to take my annual trip to disneyworld next month with some of my best friends. need some positive energy!! anyone else goin!?!?
@nicoleexo Did you sign up?
@VivianBishopxo Same. &lt;3
my acoustic version of "702" is now on ITunes. every cent i make is going straight to victims of the Las Vegas tragedy. every penny helps.
@zdevin dig what you do my man.
one of most heartfelt things I've ever recorded. if your city, friends, or family have ever been in a tragedy.. You'll understand. https://t.co/8egj9AaToK
#VegasStrong
@Carahfaye 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
@kaylawinkler @MarenMorris I am in a few days
so here is my acoustic song, "702". my voice is pretty raw in it from all of the crying but i hope you don't mind. https://t.co/i10Z1Phpao
it would mean a lot to me if you could check it out. there is a donate link under my statement to give to the victims if you are able to.
but i knew i couldn't do nothing. so i sang. i went to the studio and recorded an open letter to Vegas, to the victims, and to my community.
i was angry. i was sad. i was hurt. i didn't know what to do.. and to be honest, i still don't know what to do.
my mom had tickets to the concert. i knew hundreds of people were there. i had friends that were shot. i simply broke down.
so last week when i found about what happened in vegas.. i cried. i have no shame in telling you all of that. that is my hometown.
@dreammedown want money to go 100% to victims at start.
@dreammedown plus wanted to give people a chance to donate first before we send off to other services who will take money.
@dreammedown it will be available on all outlets. coffin club members will get chance to hear things like this first often.
👀... https://t.co/i10Z1Phpao
as if this month hasn't already been an emotional week for me.. I just found out I have my first platinum song as a songwriter. 😭😭😭
@GregorioPhoto bro text me
@samtwomiller YES!!!! I remember you telling about this one at lunch! So fucking proud of you!!!
@RaidersAnalysis Oh man 🙈
@chelseanice yes!
@natateaaa happy birthday lil' sis. stay awesome. you've grown to be a strong, kind, and intelligent woman. couldn't be more proud.

@World_Wide_Wob Hahahahahahaha
@petewentz Have so many memories with you, as well, in Las Vegas. I can't believe this.
@petewentz You described the feeling so well. always have been a fan of your words and your ability to put into words what so many of us feel.
@brittoldehoff You're telling me.
we will keep fighting. we will keep singing.
i love you, las vegas. i always knew you were strong. i always knew you were resilient. so proud to have been born and raised in this city.
all i know is.. this tragedy isn't going to make me avoid music events. i need music now more than ever.
without music i don't know what i would do or how i would cope with the world that we live in..
i'm sick of money and politics coming before lives and common sense. i'm sick of lobbyists. i'm sick of white privelage. i'm sick of guns.
at some point soon it will be somebody else's hometown. somebody else's friends and family. i refuse to heal. i refuse to not use my voice.
domestic terrorism in my city. people losing children. people losing parents. and the government isn't going to make any change.
it's been a few days since the las vegas tragedy and i still don't feel peace. I still don't feel better. still desvastated. still angry.
@tylerthalken never
and now Tom Petty is taken from us? i'm not leaving bed today. i feel sick.
can't sleep. Still waiting on texts back from a few friends that were there in Las Vegas. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this.
trying to text all of my friends and family in vegas as fast as i can. please let me know you're okay. not at a music festival. not vegas.
oh my god. oh my god. oh my god. not sleeping tonight. not my hometown. please everyone text me and let me know you're okay. please.
@robknox_ I believe in my guys. But man. What is going on.
@robknox_ I don't even have words. I'm dumbfounded.

this isn't just a single. it's the first off a 13 song album. worked years on it &amp; appreciate every one of you who took the time to listen.
this industry is so brutal.. but as long as you remember why you started it can be worth it. it's all for the fans and all about the music.

@gswan94 it's the first of many singles that will be firing your way every few weeks.
@goldengodmgk it's from the book The Dance Of Death by Hans Holbein. my back piece/tattoo is also from this book.

@DaleneKurtis can't wait for you to hear
@erika_rios1 no. They're from Oakland. Spent a few years in LA but they're from Oakland.
sorry to bombard your timeline with @RAIDERS tweets. I grew up in both Vegas and NorCal so a lot of people were asking my thoughts/feelings.
the @RAIDERS could relocate to Mars and I would still be their biggest fan.
Just win, baby.
I bleed silver and black and am looking forward to cheering them on and supporting the @RAIDERS 1000% as they move to my hometown.
that being said.. I don't think there was another option.
the city of Oakland and the fans deserved that. The @RAIDERS don't just play in Oakland.. they ARE Oakland.
honestly.. even being born and raised in Las Vegas.. i wanted the @RAIDERS in Oakland. that's where they belong.
@lindsmarra yes
@World_Wide_Wob wish every woman would sound like Scarlett Johansson and that every guy other than me would sound like spongebob. Thoughts?
I love how music can inspire athletes and how athletes can inspire musicians. It truly is symbiotic relationship. thankful @derekcarrqb.
wrote a letter to @derekcarrqb on how he handled his injury and how it inspired me to overcome hardships of my own. thank you @RBSHCC 🙌🏻

@waverlymoon were they men? women? children? black? White? Gay? Trans? Underneath everything we are all the same. We all have Bones.
@waverlymoon I was lookin at thousands of bones realizing... I couldn't tell what or who they were.
@waverlymoon the catacombs of paris inspired my name "Bohnes".

friends aren't who you've known the longest. friends aren't who's cool. friends are who check in on you. friends inspire you.
