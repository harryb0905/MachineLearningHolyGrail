.@nytimes story by @BenRothenberg on Marion Bartoli's retirement: http://t.co/nWkUm8k6yu
I can think of at least five major tennis players that came back after retiring: Borg, Muster, Henin, Hingis, Clijsters.
Boxing, MMA people know not to take fighters' retirements seriously (see Mayweather etc). Should tennis do the same?

@NailaJeanMeyers Not a bad plan. Works for me.
@NailaJeanMeyers Seems to be a dog theme in most of these. I am sensing a canine bias.
So Broner-Malignaggi had a similar storyline to Serena-Sharapova. Quite an area for boxing and tennis to meet.
That was quick. Expected Mets to let this linger until losing in the 14th.
Mets are in the process of setting up a way to lose in the most painful manner possible.
Wish I could have made it to Glory 9, but closest I could get was holding the mitts for wife's kickboxing workout.

The one thing you couldn't expect in this series: a shootout. But we may still get OT.
...and players who are not even 3.0s. Last year I did not lose a point in my first round match. Lost in 2nd round to college player.
There is a wide disparity in the level of play at Sectional qualifying. There are players who could be on the tour.....
Was expecting a 1976 Suns-Celtics moment.
C'mon, copy the NHL. Let's have some OT.
Obvious equipment differences, but their games back then wouldn't get them a Division I scholarship today.
In the middle of a point, King, who has been holding the second ball, throws it to the side of the court. Totally distracting.
A couple of grunts from Evert as she starts to play better. Just like Serena. So Chrissie can't say she never grunted.
Oh Lord. Just realized I am live tweeting a match from 40 years ago.
Evert drops the second ball behind her after serving. Don't remember that happening back then.
6-0 set for King. And for somebody who has the rep of never showing emotion Evert is showing her anger/disappointment after every point.
Love the way Evert marches around the court in between points.
1973 Wimbledon final, King vs. Evert on ESPN Classic now. I was just discovering tennis then.
Wow, Mets. Just wow.

What am I going to put on TV after Serena on HSN? UFC on Fuel, of course. I am so well-rounded.
Serena: It is summer in Europe right now!
@BenRothenberg has correct spelling of ruching. Should have known. He is the #serenaonhsn expert.
"Nobody does ruishing like Serena." I know that can't be the spelling because I am trying to look up definition and not getting anything.
Rushed home to see Serena on HSN. @BenRothenberg doing a great job, but nothing compares to seeing it yourself.
@BenRothenberg Probably longer than her court time winning her last tournament.
@TennisNewsTPN Last time she was on I learned all about leggings. Definitely educational.
Me too @BenRothenberg "I am a legging fanatic. I live in leggings." -Serena, who sometimes spends as much as $150 on her leggings.
. @BenRothenberg is live-tweeting Serena on HSN. This is what Twitter was made for.
@BenRothenberg That was the only time in my life I put on HSN. Best part of that show was the yawn.

So few tweets in my stream this morning. Tennis people sleeping, traveling, recovering from IW. MMA people not up yet either.
@ZachFunSize Did you see Federer beat the 6'9'' Isner? Figure you would appreciate somebody taking out the taller guy.
@StephinNZ That is @cbfowler
@DaveSem I think it is low-def for everyone. Since it is normally just old sports coverage it sort of makes sense.
@TomPerrotta I don't think ESPN Classic is HD anywhere. Since it is just old sports coverage I guess that makes sense.
@bgtennisnation Shocked a sports guy like you doesn't know if he has Classic. I thought you were a big fan of old AWA pro wrestling.
My Q and A with Pete Bodo of http://t.co/UasmeDOt,  http://t.co/Yvrs6cvi, about my book 45-Love: http://t.co/vnw75Rdc
In light of this Larry Ellison tennis story, http://t.co/EVWqqZOP, there is this hoops story: http://t.co/k6jtEEjx
Isner is trending in NY. And that was before he beat Djokovic.
@JohnIsner I'm 15-1. Best of anybody I know here at Saddlebrook. But my luck will probably end when I return home to NYC tomorrow.
Gave a speech about the principles of my book, http://t.co/vnw75Rdc to juniors at the Saddlebrook Tennis Academy.
If the pros at IW had what I had two weeks ago they won't be 100 percent for Miami. Caused me to take my 2nd sick day in 25 years.
@kenneth212 No. But there is a good dose of self hatred.
@jonscott9 Great! Thanks.
What do I have in common with Spadea? I don't think Sharapova has read my tennis book either. http://t.co/vnw75Rdc

@FightLawyer Thanks. It is the reason I have had to step away from the MMA beat lately. It has been an amazing day.
@rae456 Thanks. I am up to number 2 now. Only Agassi's book is ahead of me. It's unreal.
My book http://t.co/Y8PO4HoX is ranked 3rd in kindle tennis ebooks. 4th: Rafa. It is the only way I could be ranked above him.

@BrokebackTennis Yes, but they didn't have number 1 for as long. Who knows? Women's tennis is .... strange.
Losing the number 1 spot may be the best thing that could happen to Wozniacki.
Women's tennis is like a stale pro wrestling storyline where you know when somebody is going to get hit with a chair.
@ZachFunSize That is where fighters have it over tennis players. You can look to Bruce Lee. Tennis players look to John McEnroe.
I loved the Federer logo on the plastic of the newly strung racket. First time I have noticed that.
The other competition in Australia: Who will be the first person to ask Lucie Safarova about Berdych-Almagro?
@MiddleEasy Both are true. But Federer is more a Silva than a Fedor.
@MiddleEasy Hard to do, when Federer is playing.
RT: @BenRothenberg Apologies, belated hat-tip on that previous tweet to @sebastianfest.
RT: @BenRothenberg Nicolas Almagro on the crowd booing Tomas Berdych after Berdych refused to shake hands: "The people are wise."

RT@oinkness@jon_wertheim And Rafa had his own issues with Berdych back in Madrid 06. http://t.co/utS35HYp…
@tennistweets Interesting.
The goal is to hit the player, not hurt them. You apologize, move on. And the apology is real, not like when there is a net chord.
I guess Berdych never did volley drills where the goal is to hit the other players like they do at Saddlebrook. #TennisMMA.
@bgtennisnation Not only is Almagro not wrong for hitting Berdych they should make it worth a game instead of a point. #TennisMMA.
Not only is Almagro not wrong for hitting Berdych they should make it worth a game instead of a point. #TennisMMA.
Yogi had to be talking about women's tennis.
I love Clijsters winning big point with the lousy drop shot/great lob combo. I have half of that mastered.
Dolgo-Tomic sometimes looks like the 2010 45 and over clay court final between Rick Leach and Mario Tabares.
@PatrickMcEnroe Yes. But Tabares can still move. Beat me 6-1, 6-0 so I have to say that.
@PatrickMcEnroe Sometimes it looks likes the 45 and over national clay court final between Rick Leach and Mario Tabares.
...and so does Dolgopolov.

Spent hours at no gi grappling tournament at MMA Expo. Learned a lot about something I had only seen previously in context of MMA matches.
Heading back to the MMA Expo. Lots of interesting things to see.
About to leave for the MMA Expo at the Javits Center.
@USTAEastern Thanks!
won my match at the National Indoors in Salt Lake City. I'm in the final 16.
Jerry Jones says he can't put his finger on the Cowboys problems because he doesn't have that many fingers.
ESPN does a very good job with its MLS coverage. Too bad nobody is watching.
Cowboys so horrible I put on MLS playoff game. Hot game, hot crowd. And Beckham with a scruffy beard looks like one of the Geico cavemen.
I watch five minutes of Nascar all year long and in that time a couple of drivers get into a fight. But the jockeys were better.
Wife: All the players were crying at Dementieva's retirement ceremony. Me: They are going to miss that serve.
With Dementieva retiring, now I have the world's ugliest serve.
So Matt Hughes thinks the UFC needs a third man, someone who has been in the Octagon, to do commentary. I wonder who he is thinking of?
Wondering if the reason Dana White didn't rule out using Tito Ortiz again is because he is thinking about a Chuck Liddell fight.
Reaction to Velasquez beating Lesnar is starting to feel like reaction of Couture-Toney. Brock is still viewed as an outsider.
After the last couple days, Carlos Beltran is in some pretty good company,
My wife watches five minutes of UFC Primetime. Says Lesnar should not be allowed to fight people. Should be forced to fight animals.
Thrashers highlights show entire sections without fans near ice. Not Shanghai tournament level emptiness, but worst I have seen in NHL.
just saw Troicki-Nadal. Wow. Nadal now using reverse forehand on almost every shot.
With Pan Pacific Open and Ryder Cup, first time I have ever switched between two live sporting events at 4 a.m.
finally has learned to appreciate Schiavone. Ashamed it took me this long.
feels strange not being at the Open. But I won a round at my tournament, the National 45 and over grass champs in Philadelphia.
Hedlines like this always make me think of Federer for a split second: Fed to Outline Future Actions Friday http://nyti.ms/afxKAk
Just saw Tab Ramos in a Subway commercial. Wow. Haven't seen him anywhere in maybe 10 years. Probably the most honest athlete I ever met.
Another one from Frank Shamrock: MMA is to boxing as golf is to baseball. Huh?
Can't believe some of the things Frank Shamrock says. He said pro wrestlers are getting into MMA because they have to work less.
If I was in a tournament and a guy came out wearing what Federer wore today I would ask him if he needed to borrow a racket.
This guy seems so old school: http://bit.ly/9GHTNB
MMA-Tennis connection? A guy named Rafael Natal is on future UFC card. But notice spelling.
Funny, somehow I missed the hourlong TV special on Kovalchuk's "decision."
I just don't see how Damon Stoudamire is going to help the Knicks.
NHL free agency started as well and CFL opener almost got more attention in U.S. Kovalchuk is not exactly on radar. UFC more mainstream.
Whoever thought NBA off-season news would be bigger that baseball, Wimbledon and the World Cup combined? Sure seems like it.
Please make it stop. I just read a story that mentioned the Lebanon war. I thought it said the LeBron war.
had a golden set today at national Cat 2 tournament in Indiana. Opponent had nice strokes, but said he was nervous playing in tourney.
@MiddleEasy Nope. Sorry.
@MiddleEasy Saw the MSNBC headline. Reminds me of how every pro wrestling item is linked to WWF/WWE. UFC will have to get used to it.
@rae456 Thanks!
A fun story to write: http://bit.ly/cLySum
@TomJolly I knew Pelfrey would give me that save when I drafted him two years ago.
@HDNet I get HDNET on RCN cable for MMA. The channel disappeared. RCN could not say why. Can I get it online? Satellite not an option.
MSG gets into MMA and the latest on sanctioning in NY, this time by me http://nyti.ms/9A0IAk
@jenny8lee I am awake. But not for long. About to go to sleep after late shift at NYT News Service.
can't believe that I am watching all this coverage of the combine on NFL Network. This is what happens when there is no curling.
On Inside MMA, Dominick Cruz said WEC fighters are fined for cursing on the air. Guess we won't be seeing Dana White on any WEC shows.
switched to Purdue-Mich St. basketball as hockey game went into OT. Crowd was chanting U-S-A. Amazing.
Seems like a conflict of interest: Fox football reporter @Jay_Glazer at NFL combine selling his MMA conditioning program to execs, players.
Love the term "pole-dancing community" RT: jenny8lee    Pole dancers hope to compete in the 2012 Olympics. http://bit.ly/dg6HQU
Looks like SNY has Jeter presser live. Labeled as "breaking news." YES not covering. Hmm. Unless this is a tape and it all went down earlier
Today we all saw why hockey at its best is better than any other sport at its best.
just saw the Tiger Woods statement. It looked/sounded like a hostage video.
Best story of Olympics? NBC just mentioned Xcountry skier who fell into ditch, broke ribs and collapsed lung. She got up and won bronze.
is starting to understand curling. Similar to NBA. "Ends" decided in last two shots, which usually take ten minutes.
is about to head downtown for Social Media Week event on sports journalism.
Another great MMA piece by Ross. It has it all: Religion, sociology and people being hit in the head.  http://bit.ly/cv7yvz
Andreev does tennis version of a tap out in 4th set.
Federer up 2 sets to 1 over Andreev, but it hasn't been easy. More fist pumping than you will ever see from Fed in a first round match.
Enberg mentions cutting off Del Potro at U.S. Open. Says he was just trying to satisfy network bosses.
Del Potro vs Russell. A rare match where one of the players looks OK with the sleeveless. And it is not the guy with the U.S. Open title.
Since Kiki hired himself as coach, he could offer LeBron one thing other GMs couldn't: To choose coach. And that could lure big-name coach.
For great Tiger Woods jokes, check out @DanWetzel.
Fedor minus 100 pounds equals Davydenko.
loves the work and still plans to enjoy the job for as long as it lasts!
just opened a (low-calorie) ice cream bar and there wasn't any stick. Just a glob inside the package. Feels like some sort of message.
just heard my dept is being outsourced. I still love the NY Times, but have to say that if anyone knows of any editor/writer/blogger jobs...
Davydenko should go back to wearing the hat. Without the hat I can't stop thinking I am watching Charlie Brown play tennis.
@Scordo I just saw your message. Thanks!
@bykaren So sorry to hear about your dog.
finally has the Tennis Channel. Loving the coverage from Shanghai. A Tommy Ho reference! A comparison made to Gasquet and Donald Young.
RT @MichaelDavSmith Tim Tebow cleared two weeks after he's hospitalized for concussion. That wouldn't happen in boxing or MMA: Great point
Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under:  #new_york #editor #tennis #nytimes #mma #sports
got blasted in the sectional final. Ivansevic said it best: I am just a piece of garbage.
won my semifinal. It is the first time I have reached a sectional champs final in more than five years.
@MichaelDavSmith New York market also not seeing Nebraska-Virgina Tech. At least not on ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC. We have Ariz-Iowa on ESPN2
won two matches last night to reach semis of Eastern Sectional Championship 40 and overs. OK, one was a default.
Playing the role of what Andy Murray might have been: A giant with no sleeves.
RT: jonstennistweet: too stunned to tweet
How bad is tennis officiating? It had Federer cursing. And this is a sport where the officials get technological help.
@TheSlot Nice to know I am not the only one.
Tommy Haas showing his old form: http://bit.ly/7nPdo
@silencematters Speaking as one of the people doing the tweeting, I love the widget!

Kimiko Date Krumm loses close one is second round of qualies. She was trying to make her first U.S. Open since 1996. Wow.
But biggest loss was Arnaud Clement going out. Glasses, bandana, no major weapon, realies on running shots down, how could you admire him?
Gaston Gaudio and Vince Spadea knocked out of U.S. Open qualifying tournament.
Latest New York Times story by Ross: On former NFL players going into MMA: http://bit.ly/2vCJRS
Dominic Hrbaty and Xavier Malisse lose in first round of qualies on the men's side. Hrbaty was 12th and Malisse 19th at their best.
Nicole Vaidisova loses in first round of qualies. From 7th ranked to 143rd. Washed up at age 20?
Another rough day. Went against a great player and didn't belong on the same court.
Had horrible week of tennis. Played a lot, but seemed to lose timing after transition back from hard courts. Have to work harder this week.
...and a great way for Dana White to help transition his old friend from fighter to UFC/MMA ambassador.
Chuck Liddell on "Dancing with the Stars?" Marketing genius by all concerned.
lost in the semis of the 40 and over Eastern Sectional Championship.
spent the whole day and night dealing with construction issues. I miss work so much.
spent last four days mixing in construction work with heavy duty tennis workouts. Had two opponents quit in second set.
How can Dana White keep saying the UFC is avoiding boxing's mistakes when he can't sign Fedor?
took three hours to play three sets. I love red clay.
had a good two and a half hour practice today. No sets. Just drilling. Working on fitness and movement. My version of cardio tennis.
Only two hours of tennis today. I hate when I win the first two sets and my opponent doesn't want to play a third.
The Arena League is not surprising, but a top soccer league in South America having major financial problems is amazing http://bit.ly/pBqm2
The New York Times on Fedor http://bit.ly/L4U72 and on Gina Carano http://bit.ly/N19Kc
spent two days working on new apartment. Lifting and carrying lot of wood; a great workout. But back to the court on Tuesday.
is going to do some renovation/demolition work on our apartment today. Hope to get a workout out of it.
only was able to get two and a half hours of tennis. Would have had more if second opponent didn't get a blister.
Definition of a good tennis workout? When you sweat through your shoes.
played tennis for three and a half hours this afternoon. Finally, some great weather to train in.
Great theory, and it may be true, but this study seems to ignore changes in horse racing through the years: http://bit.ly/CVdfH
OK, I was wrong about Mir-Lesnar. But in the aftermath, here is another great MMA story from Ross: http://bit.ly/Z84FB
I can't keep it to myself any longer. I think Mir wins this fight.
This was something I needed to write: http://bit.ly/EEw6x

Canseco and MMA. Scary on several levels:  http://bit.ly/3eb0Q
I don't know what it is like to serve 55 aces and lose, but I once hit 23 double faults and walked away with a  win at a tournament.
You need the Tennis Channel to watch the French Open on TV on Monday.
Interesting overview of karate in MMA in light of Lyoto Machida's success in UFC:   http://bit.ly/U4P4x
Entertaining stuff on ESPN Classic: Agassi vs. Henman, live at Wimbledon. Must be BBC feed. And the grass is green.
