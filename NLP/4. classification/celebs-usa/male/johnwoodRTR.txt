Totally (but respectfully) disagree.  If #India lacks teachers, then make it a priority to recruit, raise pay, train and motivate.  If #India can put 10's of millions of people to work in IT, then why can't it do the same for something as important as teaching next generation? https://t.co/BEdadBxZMz
Thank you @TheYidanPrize for the platform to talk about lottery of life. 100's of millions of kids are denied education b/c they're born "in wrong place at wrong time to wrong parents". If we don't change that, then we have squandered our prosperity https://t.co/CfK7XXoM9i
I spent time with @AnthonySalcito yesterday at #YidanPrizeSummit and could not agree more. Great teaching will NEVER go out of style, especially if you're talking about what you want for *your* kids (not other faceless kids you try to pawn off on apps/tech) https://t.co/r9VWctW4Ts

@British_Airways Thank you @amazon for support of @RoomtoRead on #WorldBookDay.  #LovetoRead. https://t.co/iz1TtWedtV
@British_Airways After 2 1/2 hours of frustration finally board @British_Airways flight.  First thing I hear: "Sorry we don't have a meal for you". #FAIL
@British_Airways So you create massive lines, which make a passenger late, then charge him over 400 Euros to take a later flight.  Ridiculous
@British_Airways Yes, i've been rebooked after paying over 300 Euros for a new ticket, plus 80 Euro change fee.   How you can consider that FAIR is beyond me
@British_Airways 5.  Does not help that they're disempowered and indifferent contractors, rather than actual BA employees.
@British_Airways 4.  The fact that I'm a Cathay Diamond member and One World Emerald seemed to mean nothing to them.  Totally indifferent
@British_Airways 3. Instead they proposed I go on later flight, which meant paying 300+ Euros + an 80 Euro change fee.  Ridiculous.
@British_Airways 2.  They said "One hour cut-off".   This was at 8:58 AM for a 9:55 AM flight.  They offered ZERO flexibility.  Would not call the gate
@British_Airways 1.  BA8496 Amsterdam --&gt; LCY.  I showed up 1:15 before flight time.  HUGE line.  By time I got to front I was told they would not board me
An idea for @British_Airways -- have ACTUAL STAFF rather than disempowered &amp; indifferent contractors at #Amsterdam Airport.  #FAIL
#UGH.   @britishairways #FAIL.  Bumped me from flight and now telling me I can only fly biz class on next one for 400 add'l Euros
@British_Airways Yet another annoying experience being bumped by @British_Airways    Crappy way to spend the morning w/ rude and indifferent clerks
@British_Airways Why do you guys so consistently suck?  You've once again bumped me from a flight for reason and with rude service

Abandoning #TPP is horrible #Trump decision.  Every country in Asia will feel snubbed by US. China will strategically tighten their own bond

10/10.  US has survived other awkward transitions (Carter to Reagan; Bush 43 to Obama).  We will somehow survive this one, God willing
9/10.  Likewise ‚Äî He claimed the job situation was "a disaster‚Äù when unemployment rate is at 4.9%  Great, sir, pls get it lower ASAP!
8/10. Trump now owns issues for which he claimed to have simple solutions.  We‚Äôll expect "secret plan to destroy ISIS‚Äù to finish by EOQ2
7/10.  Electoral college makes mockery of "one man, one vote".  Can we blow the damn thing up America?
6/10..  Hope our friends abroad won't overlook that Clinton actually won the popular vote.  She only lost in our arcane Electoral College
5/10.  Same for Hillary. She could have been angry &amp; vindictive.  Instead, she asks all Americans to unite behind our new president
4/10.  I hope the Obama haters will note the classiness of his words:  "I am cheering for Mr. Trump to be a successful president"
3/10.   One tradeoff of living in a democracy is that things don't always break the way you'd hoped
2/10.   I don't agree with those who voted for Trump, but respect their right to do so. Hope we can all "tone it down" &amp; remain calm
My post-election commentary in 10 Tweets:  1/10.  I'm sad &amp; embarrassed.  We deserved better than nasty &amp; negative campaign. Glad it's over

#Hilary quotes Michele Obama - "When they go low, you go high"  #Debate
"No one has more respect for women than I do"   #Trump should have a nose as long as Pinocchio by this point of #Debate
"With previous GOP candidates, I never questioned their fitness to serve"   #Hilary at #Debate
#Trump apparently thinks that because #ISIS exists, we should ignore his sexual assault and misogynistic banner
#Debate just starting,  #Trump already rambling and not answering the first question

The #America that #Trump describes sounds like a dystopian hell-hole.  Perhaps a secret plan to scare off immigrants?  :) #debatenight

#NobodyCallsRosieODonnell
"This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs" #debatenight

Nice gratuitous slam on the @NYTimes   Shame on them for winning all those Pulitzers.  cc:  @NickKristof    #debatenight
"The Middle East is a mess" Yes, Donald, and who was in charge when decision made to go into Iraq? #debatenight
Obama &amp; Clinton "shouldn't have been in" Iraq. Uhh....small fact check -- they inherited the problem from Bush/Cheney #debatenight
This would be a good time for Hilary to mention how bad-ass it was when we took out Bin Laden.  #debatenight
"My ten year old son is good with computers."     Is he part of your secret plan to defeat ISIS?    #debatenight
It could be someone sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds?  What is up with that random quote?  #debatenight
Hilary calls the birther accusations a "racist lie".  #debatenight
"Nobody was caring much about it (birth certificate)" No, were weren't, because its NOT AN ISSUE. #debatenight
"You decided to stay home.  That's OK"    What a weak and gratuitious slam.  #debatenight
Ask yourself - if you were stopped&amp;frisked by police TODAY, how would you feel?  Would it increase your trust in the police? #debatenight
"Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on safety" No, it had a huge impact on alienating African-Americans #debatenight
Finally, a moment of sanity - both candidates endorse preventing people on No Fly list from acquiring guns. #debatenight
Not paying taxes does not make you smart @realDonaldTrump  Where I come from that's called being a free-loader  #debatenight
#Trump apparantly thinks his single digit approval rating amongst African American community too high, so driving it lower.  #debatenight
Stop and frisk as a national policy?  Sorry, but it was ruled unconstitutional. and blatantly racist  #debatenight
As we move to Part 2 of debate -- on race relations -- let's pray it's more dignified convo ; nation deserves nothing less #debatenight
OK, so #Trump campaign just pretty much called their own candidate out on another one of his lies.  #debatenight https://t.co/LAq4x8vHpI
"We need new airports, new schools, new highways."   Yes, we do.  So pay your taxes Donald!  #debatenight
#Trump just co-opted @JoeBiden line about our airports being out of the 3rd world.  Nice!  #debatenight
"You don't learn that much from tax returns" --OK, so release the damn things. #debatenight
"I made a mistake"   Yes.  Needed to say that a year+ ago.  #debatenight
No payment of taxes makes you smart?  Sorry, no, that makes you a freeloader.  #debatenight
My lawyers told me not to release my tax returns.  Why?  What do you have to hide?  #debatenight
FACT CHECK:   The #IRS has given #Trump the green light to release his tax returns. #debatenight
I made $694 million.   I don't give any of it away.  But I really care about the little guy  #debatenight
#Trump stop interrupting, act presidential, not like a petulant child.  Two minutes is two minutes, that's the rule  #debatenight
Amazing that Hilary was fighting ISIS before it actually existed.  Bad-ass!  #DebateNight
Donald, i know you live in your own reality.  Zing!  #debatenight
I expected #Trump to try to emulate a bit of Reagan-era optimism @ #debatenight    Instead, sounds like he's describing #Somalia
First #Trump lie of #DebateNight https://t.co/obMS3OkngR

Obama's proposal basically says -- if you want a gun, you have to have a background check.  Why is that controversial?
IMHO, the current system for gun laws in the US is clearly not working, so we have to try something new.

40% of guns in America are acquired without background check   You can't drive car w/o license. But guns -- go for it!
Dear America. Until we can hand-on-heart say we have no crazy people amongst our 300MM+ population, we might need to impose some limits
America crossed a threshold today.   Let's admit open access to automatic  weapons is a HORRIBLE idea.
How many more horrid days like today does America have to go through before we get serious about gun control?

Chris Christie is afraid of Syrian toddlers &amp; orphans. His family came to US from Sicily, Germany &amp; Ireland. Xenophobia is Un-American
My ancestors arrived in America from Germany, Ireland &amp; Norway. They built new lives. Why do today's refugees deserve any less?
Is Donald #Trump Navajo? Sioux?  No, like many Americans he's 3rd generation immigrant.  Shame on him for demagoguing this issue
More Americans should (IMHO) remember that 99% of us are descended from immigrants.  Speak out for a welcome &amp; inclusive society
If US limits #Syria immigration to Christians thats a very dark day for nation built on OPEN immigration. Xenophobia is non-American

No transport = No rebuilding 1 million kids out of school in #NepalQuake They need schools rebuilt &amp; fuel shortages kill that possibility
The people of #Nepal should decide their Constitution. #India and #China should get oil in, as we're playing w/ lives as winter approaches
1 million kids are out of school in #Nepal.  100s of thousands are homeless.  Winter is approaching.  Fuel shortage = playing w/ lives
To be clear - I'm NOT taking sides in arguments over constitution.  That is for people of #Nepal to decide. But fuel cut-off should end NOW
#Nepal has more than enough problems, so why is #India gov't adding to them by creating fuel shortages?  WINTER IS APPROACHING

Without Ridding, no way the #FT would be the prized asset it is today, or command US$1.3BB valuation
Ridding was key strategist in moving #FT to success in digital, and in global expansion of circulation
I may be biased because he's a close friend &amp; @RoomtoRead Board member, but too many FT stories today overlooked John Ridding (CEO)
@RoomtoRead proud to be long term partners with @FT Financial Times and wish them all best with new ownership by Nikkei
My ethnicity is Norwegian, German and Scottish.  But I humbly believe I've been an asset to America.  Immigration rocks!
My great-grandparents were immigrants to America.  Of unknown legality as back then no laws.  And yet all worked out in long run

This keeps me going: by end of 2nd grade #Nepal kids w/ @RoomtoRead library in their schools reading 2.9X as fast as in comparison schools!
We'll be using the #Nepal Education Fund to rebuild &amp; repair the entire school environment in Nuwakot. #NepalQuake http://t.co/yFDecE1Qq5

@RoomtoRead_DFW our #Nepal Country Director has two children living in #Dallas.  We will have to connect you!
Thrilled to report little to no damage to our Nuwakot libraries. We installed most inside quake-resistant structures. #NepalQuake
Amazing! Only 7% of @RoomtoRead constructed classrooms suffered major damage, 20% minor thanks to our quake-resistant design #NepalQuake

We are united We are strong We are @RoomtoRead #Nepal http://t.co/2Qj883IA7l

Of our 624 infrastructure projects, 399 were in quake zones across 11 districts in #Nepal #NepalQuake
The April 25th &amp; May 12th #NepalQuake destroyed 32,000 classrooms &amp; damaged an additional 15,000. Heartbreaking to witness.
BTW, the school survived #NepalQuake completely intact thanks to quake-resistant design http://t.co/5BbP1eRUxO http://t.co/sR66ybqXQD
