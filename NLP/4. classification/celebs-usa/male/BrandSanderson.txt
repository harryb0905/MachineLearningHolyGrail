Sadly, we won't be able to ship the Dragonsteel leatherbound edition of The Hero of Ages until January. Though the delay was out of our hands we are disappointed to share this news. The book is gorgeous, and we can't wait for you to get your hands on it in the new year!
I have some unfortunate news: the national paper shortage has again pushed back delivery on the Dragonsteel leatherbound editions of The Hero of Ages. This means that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to ship any for Christmas.

Doomslug the Destroyer. (I’ll let you decide which one I’m talking about.) #Skyward https://t.co/ePf4Xj9APA
Houston IAH airport! There are 3 signed (and Doomslugged) #Legion and 1 #Oathbringer at the simply books by gate C1 (roughly.) This airport only has the one store, and they only had a few books left, so hop quickly if you want one.
We just got our copies of the UK edition of #Skyward in, what do you think of it? https://t.co/WAAXWrC7DN
Here is an awesome and unique character design of Vin in street urchin attire using a Rembrandt color scheme by @_Cassandra_Lee_. #mistbornmonday https://t.co/rBuAUWMxPR https://t.co/4NUVtf4tOf
Atlanta airport, Doomslug and I also hit the B gates Buckhead Books (center) and the Simply Books by B28. They both have a smaller selection than the A gate store. Finally I hit the @hudsonbooks in the F terminal. (Pictured.) Be sure to check in YA too! https://t.co/9mohQNo6Ba
Atlanta airport, the Simply Books just up the escalator in the A terminal was ready for me! They had a TON of my books on hand. (This picture doesn't even have half.) Doomslug in each one! Say hi to Anita the bookseller for me, and maybe share this post with anyone flying through https://t.co/QtFb7URvcE
Had a wonderful experience at church today in the Atlanta area.  Thanks to those who said hi, and to the choir for their beautiful music.
Chicago Ohare! I managed to hit three of the @barbarasbooks stores in the airport. By gates B10, H/K4, and E5. I love these stores, so I spend extra time signing lots of copies. Remember to look for #Skyward in YA. Doomslug is hiding in everything I signed!
Denver airport, I only managed to get to one book store in the airport this time.  The Tattered Cover at the center of the B gates. Find #Oathbringer in the new releases, and #Steelheart in teen. Say hi to the bookseller Leon Ray for me! He is great.
This is awesome! Thank you Reddit user u/SkywardFlight for making this awesome Lego M-Bot! https://t.co/NrzcNKGRnY https://t.co/XxKXWpFNM8
Wow! I'm so thrilled that my weird little idea has resonated so well with you. Thank you so much for helping #Skyward reach #3 on the NYT Best Seller list. https://t.co/Ye5z8YWkgn
Salt Lake airport! You are restocked with signed books. Simply Books by gate C7 has #Oathbringer and #Skyward in stock, Doomslug stickers inside!
All right, Anchorage!  I am here!  My first time in Alaska. I hope to see many of you at the B&amp;N tonight!
@AccostedTone I agree. Doing what I can to make it happen!
If you are passing through SeaTac Airport, and want signed Sanderson bookswith Doomslug stickers inside, your best bet is the @HudsonBooks near the food court/B gates. Nice selection there. I also found four Oathbringers in the @HudsonBooks by Gate C2. (Picture shows that one.) https://t.co/Z8D37wHXOS
My apologies to the folks who recognized me at church in Seattle today. I would have stayed to chat, but I had to run to get to the airport on time. The meeting was wonderful, though, with a focus on gratitude.

@elektrotal It wasn't the same without you.
@DatingRev Depends. At newsstand type stores, I just sign. At actual bookstores, I introduce myself first.
@ohaiitznick My pleasure!
Aha! Here is a real stack of books for you! San Francisco Airport terminal 2 Compass Books (just past security) is a great store with an awesome staff. They're the first airport store I have found with copies of Skyward. Plus more! Doomslug stickers inside each one. https://t.co/fW4HB3FMi6
Three signed copies of the Oathbringer Trade Paperback edition at a San Francisco Airport @HudsonBooks by gate 40.  Doomslug  sticker inside. https://t.co/s4uz2gvU1N
@luismariomiller They are in continuity with each other. So you are right!
@Vyrrk Last Night, I'm afraid. If you sign up for my newsletter, we will try to send you advanced warning next time. Mysterious Galaxy has signed copies of the new books, though.
@Bemo24601 Thanks! I hope to visit Sweden next year. :)
@handleinthedark Thanks for the suggestion. I will try to make time for it on one of these stops.
@Zmann966 @PeterAhlstrom Peter, can you have Adam get some more details on this signing?  Details don't seem clear.
The San Diego airport Warwick's Bookstore (Gate 36) is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Enthusiastic staff and a great selection of books, especially for an airport store.  They have signed Oathbringer and Legion, among others, all with Doomslug stickers!
If you weren’t able to attend my signing at @MystGalaxyBooks last night you can still get signed copies of #Skyward and #Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds (they even ship internationally). https://t.co/FsWpSPjKyd
Apparently, #Skyward made it into the semifinals of the @goodreads Choice Awards on the strength of the preview chapters alone. If you’ve finished the book, consider voting for it here: https://t.co/KwYWVIW823
Salt Lake City airport Simply Books (Gate C7) is restocked with signed books! They are out of Skyward (more arrive Friday) but have Legion and some gorgeous new Oathbringer Trade Paperbacks. I stuck Doomslug (from Skyward) stickers in many of them! Now, off to San Diego.

@OesedEsare Yes, you may!
@Xt1m3blazeX I cheat a little, as my fantasy is a lot like SF and my SF a lot like fantasy.  But in SF, I can't fudge physics as much, which leads to some unique challenges.
@WestMat You're certainly not the only one--though, embarrassingly, I did miss that particularly installment myself.
@joniaustin Yes, I did!
@lvaroLoboCasti2 Yes, I will--but it will involve characters you haven't seen yet.

Adam here. We goofed on the subject line of the newsletter we sent out today. It should say the Legion book is out today, not Oathbringer. Whoops.

@elektrotal @commanderinmtg Yeah, I feel bad I haven't been able to make this happen yet.  I really am game to do it--the timing just has been tough.
@JoshLeeKwai I've been putting together a really cool commander cube, if you guys are up for something a little different...
@Top8Games @elektrotal I still think that @SheldonMenery let me win just because he wanted to see what my combo would do.
@JackCain Thanks!
@michaelhguy @KTotem @OasisGamesSLC Yup.  Slowly replacing my revised duals.
@edenGD02 I don't think Mr. Jordan wanted there to be more, so I have not pushed for more--but Harriet has let me print a deleted scene from AMoL in an upcoming anthology next year.
@TasdiqueC @fanxsaltlake I don't have plans right now, I'm afraid.  I was just there for BookCon.
At FanX, I had some time, so I walked out to @oasisgamesslc.  And it turns out they had something I couldn't say no to buying... https://t.co/BM7Rfk7uZZ
My first signing at @fanxsaltlake starts at 8:00 in room 255A. If you can’t make it tonight, don’t worry. I have signings on Friday and Saturday night in the same room.  https://t.co/fEq0C8urQD

Our resident art director @IzykStewart put together an awesome blog post showing the evolution of the #Legion covers throughout the years. It's well worth the read. https://t.co/FYsM1CRh4e
My wife Emily put together a quick review of @MaryRobinette's new book The Fated Sky, the sequel to The Calculating Stars, on my @goodreads page. https://t.co/6FaGQ3T79J

@JohnCarlBishop @TheRock He IS awesome, but I've always liked this depiction: https://t.co/MEHjiYUOIp
@WhyNotViolet Shouldn't be too much longer before I get to Argentina.  @TheDanWells has been working on me by texting me pictures of steak he got there.
@WaterstonesNG @vecna @WaterstonesMK All right, well, @gollancz and @StevieFinegan are going to have to make this happen now.  A squeeing gif has been deployed.
@WhyNotViolet If it's a store I visit often, I introduce myself.  But today, I did exactly what you said.
@larryhl45 Not that many.  Several black sharpies, a gold and a silver paint pen, and a regular pen.
@Hannah_A_17 I usually get to Scotland on my UK tours.  But the next one isn't likely to be until next summer.
@Lethal_Phantasm I was in Calgary a few years back, but has probably been too long since I've hit other Canadian locations.  I'll be in Alaska this November, if you happen to live near the border in that direction.
@ShaunEricJ Once in a while, they ask for proof.  (Which is easy, considering that my picture is in many of the books.)  But for a lot of little stores, like this one, I just sign them and nobody notices.
@WaterstonesMK Well, I'll be sure to put that on my next UK tour, then!  Might be another year before I can squeeze one in.
@BrianTMcClellan It's such a shame I lost Scalzibane.
@ClinChemMD My home airport bookstore in SLC is great.  But I'm also very fond of the @barbarasbooks in Chicago O'hare.
San Jose Airport, I only found one bookstore (Authors Bookstore in Terminal A, I believe.)  The only thing they had were three copies of Towers of Midnight, shelved in the classics(?) section.  I signed them in gold pen; if we're in the classics section, we need to be extra fancy
Had a great time at church in San Jose today! Thanks to everyone who made me feel so welcome.
My first @worldcon2018 panel, "Wound Patterns and Survivability in preindustrial Warfare – Implications for Classic Fantasy," starts at 1:00 in room 210C. You can see the rest of my schedule on my Upcoming Events page. https://t.co/6npQh7ER6t
If you're at Worldcon (or live in the San Jose area) and want to see me, my schedule conveniently has all my events packed onto one day.  (Tomorrow.)  Warning, Worldcon can be a little expensive as conventions go. My schedule can be found here: https://t.co/6npQh7ER6t
@lsv @ChannelFireball Some expeditions for the cube.  I'd hoped to grab some beta duals to replace my embarrassing white-bordered ones, but they don't keep that kind of single on-hand at the game center. (I'd had an inkling this might be the case.) That said, the employees were really nice and helpful
@adribbleofink I mostly like to draft.  I got a little burned out on big multiplayer games in college, and just don't play often enough to follow standard.  So you'll find me drafting whatever wacky combo deck I can make work.
@andrearob5809 Some play that young, but my 10 year old still finds it a little complicated.
@n00dlefingers I mostly draft these days.  Powered cube is my favorite.
@TFSDaniel @lsv @ChannelFireball It was my honor.
@theBenjaminCook @lsv @ChannelFireball Bought some Expeditions to go in my cube.
@theBenjaminCook @lsv @ChannelFireball Vorthos Johnny, as one might expect of me.
So, since I'm in San Jose early recording Writing Excuses, and since Worldcon doesn't start until tomorrow, I maaaay have found my way to a place where I could spend too much money on Magic cards. @lsv @ChannelFireball https://t.co/zzPAYJ3nEf

@cwcoyle Thank you very much!
@AndreaPtak That's a legit criticism, one I hadn't considered.
@kinda_writing It is my honor.  Thank you for the kind words.
@orbital_banshee One reason is that Ruin had a person in control of it who, for many years, fought against the impulse to destroy--and in the end, channeled it toward entropy and decay, necessary elements of the universe.  Odium represents something else entirely.
Here is the forthcoming cover of the Chinese tranlation of #Warbreaker by Jian Guo. https://t.co/CBww0EVwY9 https://t.co/hpj22TAuIY

@SBarton1954 @usbergo @goodreads Many universities and colleges have editing programs, and these can often lead to work in the field. (Such as corporate editing/writing jobs.) Fiction/novel editing jobs are rare, and are mostly in New York City; you'd want work experience before trying to get one.
@SBarton1954 @usbergo @goodreads I teach a university course.  I can foresee teaching it other places on occasion, if I'm traveling for a period, but for now the only way to take it is to live in Utah and apply to BYU.
@usbergo Maybe someday I'll get on the ball and read the books you guys write when you send them to me, rather than months/years after they've been published...  @BrianTMcClellan @CNHolmberg @PeggyEddleman @stevenbohls
I just posted a review of Dark Immolation—book two of the Chaos Queen series by my former student Christopher Husberg (@usbergo)—on my @goodreads page. The third book, Blood Requiem, is out today! https://t.co/kMHQaxCJpG
@RickNashtag @BooksofWonder That was me!
@Wubdor Huh.  That does seem odd. @PeterAhlstrom, could you look into this?
@SDancause Sorry. We don't set those prices.  :(
New York! If you missed me over the weekend, I visited the Books of Wonder store on 84th and brandalized a few of their books.  This new location of theirs is really nice, with great staff. You should drop by! @booksofwonder
We are having a summer sale on my website and even have a few hardcovers for just $10! https://t.co/w4YQzpQSAH
@LawnGnomefromYT I had never heard that suggestion, but as I think, it totally works.
@willread4booze It was my pleasure. Thanks for stopping by!
Thanks to all who came to see me at BookCon today! If you missed me, I signed some books for the Strand bookstore to put on their shelves.  Also, Dynamite Comics has some signed copies of White Sand at their booth.  For tonight, Emily and I are going to enjoy some Mozart. https://t.co/hS8rvrqOch
A Mistborn is trying to infiltrate the Random House booth. https://t.co/JInCv5zDMS
BookCon! I have been told that if you bring proof that you have pre-ordered Skyward to the Random House booth (2121) you get a free beach towel. Look for the "underlined" section.  @GetUnderlined #BookCon
My last signing of the day at BEA is at the Dynamite booth (1811). We have a hundred free copies of White Sand we are giving out, first come first served.  Starts at 4:00.
@IckyMDem Thanks.  And happy birthday!
@Eridinus That is pretty close.
I have two signings today at @BookExpoAmerica and @thebookcon in NYC today. The first is 2:00 pm in the autograph area. The second is 4:00 pm at the @DynamiteComics booth (#1811). See my website for the rest of my schedule. https://t.co/XyWPCWUTvP
@vecna @LEGO_Group I'd be on board for sure!
@Stormborn125 These questions stray into RAFO type territory, which I try not to delve too deeply into on twitter.  (Because of the short space I have to reply.)  But there are some hints in the links @sandersonarmy included...  Thanks for reading!
@Deanishes It shouldn't, but it depends on how long it takes.  (I'm almost done with it, though.)
I wrote a little post concerning harassment at @fanxsaltlake, I hope you will give it a read as this is an issue of great importance to me. https://t.co/OpSUyQMcsH
Salt Lake city airport bookstore (Gate C7) is again stocked with signed books! Including Oathbringer hardcovers up front. Say hi to Tony the Bookseller if you stop by!
@RussellSHammond Sorry. And thanks. :)
@mandaratterree Just means I have to come back another time, I suppose. :)
@UnknownAsFuck I think so, but shipping might be killer.
@JonoDano :)
I had a great time at MisCon. Thanks to everybody who made me feel so welcome, and to Muse Comics for providing some Magic cards for our draft!
I had a great time at church in Missoula today. Thank you to everyone who made me feel so welcome!
@Victoria_Gluch Thanks!
@CaptValerio I'm not 100% sure.  If you're asking about the English edition, I believe they do them around one year after the hardcover--but I don't track the European release dates as well as I should.  (Sorry.)
@sevastra82 :(
@MageReluctant Enjoy!
@JackTheYounger This is a very dangerous and frightening thing in the cosmere, but it is possible--and the implications of it are something I intend to cover eventually in the books.
@Arizonias1 Thanks!  Hope you enjoy the second as well!
@TLDiggles Ha.  That's a LITTLE more difficult for me to do than SLC is...
@Grink Nobody has yelled at me, but a few times, I've been stopped by confused store clerks.  I usually just show them my face in the back of the hardcovers, and that works.  (Though at the SL Airport store, they all know me by now.)
I'm in Missoula for the convention, but on my flight out yesterday, I made sure the Simply Books at the Salt Lake airport was restocked with signed books.  So if you're flying through, stop by the store. (Near gate C7.)
Be sure to check out Brandon's schedules for MisCon 32 in Missoula, MT this weekend and @thebookcon 2018 in NYC next weekend. https://t.co/yO013Ol9we

@WordsOfBA These days, I'm pretty sure small screen is more likely, considering the size of the books.  But we're trying.
@Copenhagann Thanks!  And I'm quite a fan of Audible myself, and Michael/Kate (the readers of Stormlight) are incredible, so I'm glad you enjoy the audiobooks!  We work hard on them.
@h1brd Enjoy!
@dblasphemy Well give him an official (if belated) "Happy Birthday" from me!  I find his taste in shirts to be quite good.
@thegeekysandwic Doing my best...  :)
@PsykkoMike My pleasure!  Thanks for reading, and enjoy that ending.
@BookBuddyLin Usually, there IS a book limit.  I don't know for sure here, but generally the limit between one and three personalized books.  I try to do quick signatures (not names) in the others you bring--but it depends on the convention organizers.
@GraeArea_ Similar, yes, but scenes like that are always part my experience, part my extrapolation of what the character might have experienced.
@JemmaMYoung That's a great scene to choose.  I'm eager to see how it turns out.
@jeff_swarts Different spren have different properties.  They talk about this in the series at some point, I believe.

@MrOrpin Very close.  It isn't done across the chest though, but with the hands held out.
@HeatherReinblat Huh.  That's annoying. Drop me an email through my website, mention this exchange, and I will try to work you in another time while at the con.
@BookBuddyLin Cool!  See you there!
@PeterAhlstrom @ericpeters That is incredible.
@GabySpartz @direwolfdigital @lsv @wrapter @thepchapin @MatthewNass @abaeckst It was my pleasure!  Thank you for organizing this, and for doing the hard work.  (And by that, I mean, putting up with LSV.)  I'm sorry I couldn't be there to watch live, but I'm looking forward to the replay.

My charitable foundation is looking for 10 volunteers in the SLC area to help with a little project this Saturday. Volunteers will receive a swag bag–including a leatherbound Mistborn. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to make it but if you’re interested please DM me for more info.
Sins of Empire, book one of Gods of Blood and Powder, by @BrianTMcClellan is currently on sale in the US for just $2.99! If you enjoyed his Powder Mage Trilogy as much as I did, I’m sure you will love this too. https://t.co/TMM1uSfK42

As a teen browsing the SF section at bookstores, I looked at the shelves filled with the books of famous authors and thought, "You know, if I could some day have one whole shelf to myself, that would be incredible." Anyway, Orem B&amp;N is now restocked with signed books... https://t.co/R9rNXvrxw9
@Brutetal By now they all know me by sight...
Excellent news! Hudson books just sent me this: "@HudsonBooks: @BrandSanderson We have good news! Hudson is opening a bigger bookstore in F in the middle of May. Just a few stores down from where the old Simply Books was. We do currently have Simply Book stores in A and B open."
@HudsonBooks Whew!  Well that is great news!  The ATL treks will continue. :)
Our quest at least has come to a satisfying conclusion. The Simply Books at the center of the A Gates has a ton of my books. (They might have gotten the stock from the E Gate store when it closed.) Those are all now signed!
End of an era? I used to travel all up and down Atlanta Airport, signing at most Terminals.  They survived even the ebook revolution, for a while. But today, I am 0/2 as the E gate bookstore has mysteriously removed its SF/F section.  (I did find 2 AMOLs in the clearance section)
Unfortunately, the steady vanishing of airport bookstores has struck Atlanta since I last visited. The bookstore in the F Terminal has been replaced with a cafe. (So far as I could tell, it didn't move to a new location.) I will try E Gates next
Church in Atlanta was great. Thanks to those who said hi.  :)
My panel at @JordanConInc, "Sandertrack RAFOlympics," is at 2:30 today. This is an open Q&amp;A where you can ask me anything you want while trying not to get RAFO'd (read and find out). https://t.co/axuhFIB36N

@BrianTMcClellan Oh!  Well, then...
@JHamiltonWMA I usually do some on my way out. But I will try to find a local bookstore and sign some there too.
@BrianTMcClellan I am already on the plane, or I would totally go find some way to deface those.

Signing today! I will be at the Orem Dragons Keep this afternoon at 2:00 to sign copies of White Sand Vol. 2. Call the store for shipping options if you're wanting a signed copy (801.225.7623).
I have a signing at Dragons Keep in Orem tomorrow afternoon at 2:00. I hope to see you there, but if you can’t make it that’s okay. The greatest compliment you can give me is to read my books. https://t.co/sJpQNgrGtM
@lucasoftunes I have considered it, but only briefly.  It feels like a ton of work.
@jpbushidoaudio Bridge Four!
@theclickster Huh?  That's strange.  The book is out as of last week--I've seen it in stores, and have signed copies.  It is not postponed, and should be shipping out.
@harbour112 I imagined like a tall cordial glass, without much of a base on it.
I just found out that the Oathbringer hardcover is 30% off at Barnes &amp; Noble until March 12th. https://t.co/Uhv1UMHAux

@Neorotoxin @StephenKing I would guess it depends on the project, the year, and the circumstances.
The Hudson in Sea-Tac Airport by Gate B1 has signed Sanderson books. @PatrickRothfuss appears to have stopped by also, as his books all have "signed by the author" stickers on them. (I know what you're going to say. No, I didn't sign his books too. This time.)
Had a great time at church today in Seattle. Thanks to all who made me feel so welcome!
We added another signing from 5:00–7:00 tonight in the Writer's Block area. See my upcoming events page for full details. @emeraldcitycon https://t.co/KOqBlg8KbE

@victortanedo Nothing to worry about.  Just an @ that went astray.
Don't panic about that last tweet, folks. Just an @ that I screwed up.  Twitter, maybe make it so that if someone clicks a tweet to reply to, then starts typing, that doesn't start a new tweet--but instead replies to the one you clicked?
@OldManShween Yeah.  For some reason if I click on a reply on twitter, then just start typing, it once in a while just sends it as a tweet update instead of a reply.  Very frustrating.
@lf_oake Sorry.  Once in a while, twitter just sends my replies as tweets?  I haven't figured out yet what I'm doing that makes it go wrong.
@PaasDonovan @emeraldcitycon I don't think they put me on anything Sunday.  Pretty sure I fly out that day.  (Sorry.)  I didn't really have much control over the schedule--I'm just doing what they asked me to do.
Not right now, I'm afraid.  :(
For those at Emerald City Comic Con, I WILL be doing a Magic: the Gathering draft.  It will be casual/fun, so don't worry if you haven't played in a while.  (Though I do ask that you know how to play before signing up.) Info and sign up sheet at my table (KK3) in artist’s alley.
Pick up this year’s con exclusive and leatherbound editions of Elantris-fresh from the printer-at my table (KK3) in artist’s alley. We’ve also got epic bookmarks for those who stop by. @emeraldcitycon
My first panel, "Writing Magical Stories That Make Sense," at @emeraldcitycon is today at 4:00 and will be followed by a signing at 5:15. See full details on my upcoming events page. https://t.co/KOqBlg8KbE
@Cosmerenaut16 RAFO!
@JRBatman23 I wouldn't call him a coward. I'd call him a guy with severe PTSD who is having a rough time working through it.
Sea-Tac Airport! Find signed Sanderson books at the @hudsonbooks by Gate A5. Oathbringer is there, but in the front of the store. Ask the staff; they were very helpful.
@skybluekicks It is my honor and pleasure.

@acspahn @BobOfTheLight I somehow missed this, but you rock.  This was very fun to read.  :)  Thanks!
@TheHachTag I loved the latest short story collection from Jane Yolen (There's a review on my goodreads.)  I love Kurt Vonnegut's work, and of course Asimov.  @MaryRobinette writes a really great short story, as did the great Ursula K. Le Guin.

@GlassJMPrison87 I really liked how that turned out, so I'm not opposed to doing so--though that was a project my publisher came up with, not my team.  So I'd have to talk to them, or create something new from scratch.  (Which I'm kind of interested in doing.)
@iPandaJC Everyone is different, but generally if I time myself (and see what an average hour of work creates for me) I can establish a baseline, then keep watch and try to meet minimum goals per hour, then not stress as long as I'm meeting them.
Here's a quick update on my current and future writing projects. https://t.co/DKmAWQWHl8

In memory of the great Ursula K. Le Guin, let me point you toward my favorite collection of her stories: https://t.co/WyirxkWJtQ.  She was not only an amazing writer, but a crusader for SF/F as legitimate literary genres.  She will be missed.

@m_wrenshall Afraid not.  :(
@whalladay @Nephlimus @PeterAhlstrom I can't remember, honestly.  Peter will know--but he's on vacation following the turn in.  Shouldn't be too much longer.
@mikezentz :)
@robert_mee We'll see.  I've missed DC on the latest tours, so I really should get out there. I wish the Borders hadn't closed.
@snefrue Not this time, I'm afraid.  Toronto earlier in the year was the only Canadian stop this time.  I'll try to get somewhere western next time.
@laZ3rboi69 Afraid I don't usually have time during tour for that any more.  :(
@74rku5 Release party is Utah County, and then I'll do another one close to Christmastime once I'm back from my UK tour.
@Nephlimus @PeterAhlstrom Yes.  I think I have Tor persuaded to post like a quarter of the book--almost as much in "sample" chapters as an entire novel.
@chertex Thanks!
@GraeArea_ I'll be visiting the UK in December.
@Kookie_the_Bard Sorry.  The tour is very tight this year because we're releasing so close to a holiday.
@robbyde I'll be going to the UK in early December for another week of touring.
@Iocabus13 Afraid not.  The tour is very tight this year because we're releasing so close to a holiday.
@MaxiCilauro Yes, I will be.
No, that's just the bookstore providing the books.  I believe it's happening off-site anyway.
@overlordjebus Shouldn't be too much longer.  We just have to lock in all the stores.
@SmartAndis0405 Yup.  I should be heading out to the UK in early December.
@TomNowa Would you rather we cut it into four parts, and sold each one for $8?  It costs $5 to print and ship a Hardcover. So $17 ebook is a discount
@TomNowa I've fought to get other books cheaper in ebook--but honestly, not the Stormlight books.  They're 4 times larger than a regular book.
@T1CKT0CKM4N I'm touring NASA on my off day, so...
@Leinton Yup.  Anything on release day gets numbered--and this time, that includes MG.

@DragonCon @oilroughneck I went last year! Not this year, I'm afraid.
@pryanik_ua Afraid that I can't get to Germany again this year. (Was in Leipzig this spring)
@JokingAmaror @HeyneVerlag It's not money grubbing--they can be literally too long for some printers to bind. Even US has trouble.
@JokingAmaror @JABberWorld @HeyneVerlag Almost all countries have to cut Stormlight, including UK. They are 4x the size of other books.
@GrahamGeekEire Unlikely, I'm afraid. I only have 5 days.
@WTSkaditch @TommyKPPotter I think I might be at Portland this time, as I was in Seattle last time. But we will post on my website.
@arilochi Awesome!  Give him my best.
@PoseySessions @MainStBooksUT I was in and out really quickly. I'll try to send warning next time.
@TommyKPPotter :)
@TommyKPPotter Should be in the area early December for the Oathbringer tour.
The used bookstore in Cedar City, Utah (Main Street Books) had one hardcover of Well Of Ascension. It is quite worn.  But also now signed!

@tochoromero I answer one every Friday on my blog.  It's a thing my assistant, Adam, came up with.
@overlordjebus @ArgentSun :)  It is your solemn right to REEEE.
@ArgentSun Heh.  :)
@ArgentSun Actually, I'd say they're more for the casual fans than the hardcore ones.  (Who tend get their answers, one way or another.)
@ArgentSun The fact that so many want it answered means that they don't know it.  These questions aren't just for the hardcore fans, I'm afraid.
@ChrisWarcraft :) As an aside, I wonder if you missed your calling as an editor.  Those are some mighty fine line edits you suggested in the beta.

@Un0ri The 1:30 one is the one I tried. But yes, it probably moved nearby for construction.
@thegreatmutato :)
@Un0ri It's okay.  There wouldn't be time to get there anyway. I'm good.
@ClimateKings November. :)
After walking around the block looking for any blatant white shirts and ties, I am on to plan B: stroll through the Leipzig old town.
@PatrickRothfuss Yes, I should look for the Anabaptist church instead. That should go well.
@ItsMeJSFG yes, there is. We are looking at both, but the first screenplay we are trying is for a film.
@mwittrock probably renovation, by the looks of it.
Hmmm.  Tried to find church in Leipzig, but arrived at a construction project. Seems like my information is out of date...
@Fumaria_ I will just have to come back. :)
@TheGorillars https://t.co/xcoRdjTMJi has an events section. We try to keep it up to date.

@AlexHale1 For the Oathbringer release.
Leipzig, if you're at the fair &amp; want to say hi, I will be at the Piper booth (Hall 4 row B) for 30 min. Then I go sign at Ludwig bookstore.

@YataVSTheWorld I've been pushing for one answer, but Peter (whom I trust) is pushing back.  We will see what ends up in the books as canon.
@YataVSTheWorld Hm. Yes, I wondered last night if I'd ever answered this before.   Truth is, the answer is contentious at Team Sanderson.

Apologies for the website/store outage. It's not just our site but everything at our web host. Nothing we can do but wait....
You guys killed the science fiction section at O'Hare Gate E5, buying all the things. I had them dig out a handful more to sign. :)
@blindgoatia Worked once for me but wouldn't load the second time.  Hmmmm...  Sent my people an email. Thanks.
@higgskatie Theory has fatal flaws.  Model BR1975 has aging algorithms to prove it is a real human being.
Chicago O'Hare, also find many signed books (with Epic bookmarks) at the large Barbara's bookstore by gate H4.  Many copies, some in Teen.
Chicago O'Hare airport! Barbara's Bookstore by gate G2 is small, but still has many signed Sanderson books.  Tell Lauren I sent you. :)

@teiksim No immediate plans, but I'd like to some day.
@yafeshan Tons of revisions on this, then Apocalypse Guard (Steelheart Followup.)
@WattoTony Ha.  Don't remind me of that right now...
@NeilMishra2 No, it's longer.
@loodyvip Apocalypse Guard comes first.  But both have to wait until this one is at least on third draft.
@glen_malley The polish is still several drafts away.  But yes, even getting it out November will be tight for a book this long.
@ArgentSun Ha!
@Phantrosity RAFO.
@SamSpiller666 Dude, do you know how long it takes to revise a 2300 page manuscript?
@DarthDeekay They will be.
That's a wrap, folks. Oathbringer is done at 461,223 words. Still much work to do, but we have a first draft. November 2017 release date.
@theboonarmies November next year.
@joshprismon Can't play until Stormlight 3 is done, and at least part is in the hands of beta readers.
@joshprismon Heh.  No spoilers.  I bought a copy, but gave my PS4 to my brother in law for the holidays, so I wouldn't be tempted.

@dscrabeck Yup.  Pat too.  It was called True Myths when I did my recording session, which felt more appropriate. But I like the result.
@robthadawg916  @PeterAhlstrom Might not be Stormlight 3, it will depend on what Peter's lists look like right now.  But maybe!
@robthadawg916 @PeterAhlstrom You might offer us a valuable perspective, Robbie. Contact Peter, and we'll see if we can use you some time.
@mbudrovic Most are chosen because of their years in fandom, interacting on one of the fan communities. Peter does it, not I.
@dreamandwonder Yes.  Had to do work with some very unruly screws, but after reseating the cords, it booted as regular.
@darci_cole @PeterAhlstrom Shouldn't be too much longer.
Okay, finished a batch of Writing Excuses episodes here in Chicago. Let's see what we can do about that 1% left of Stormlight 3, shall we?
Adam here. Brandon's French readers may enjoy reading an interview he recently did with @elbakin. You're welcome. https://t.co/vsqZrFZNAC
@MiEhrynn People really seem to like it, so I make an effort to leave some everywhere. The store employees are starting to recognize me.
Chicago O'Hare! I'll hit more stores on my way out, but right now, find signed books at Barbara's bookstore gate E5. Epic bookmarks inside!
My company's art director @IzykStewart and I both backed @whelanmichael's new art exhibit and art book Kickstarter. https://t.co/av8pQNV1Ey
The amazing artist of the Stormlight Archive @whelanmichael has a Kickstarter up for his new exhibit and art book: https://t.co/8RhV7Agm3w
@Ayn_Skyfighter It won't always work to do so, but it is a skill most writers learn, as it is one of the marks of a professional.
@Ayn_Skyfighter Sometimes, you just can't meet the deadline. Everyone understands. However, you CAN teach yourself to develop stories faster
Aspiring writers, we need questions to answer on writing Excuses.  (You don't need to fill out every blank.) https://t.co/yAIp3lD4DW
@cmbadiuk I was there a few years back, but I'll try to make it again. :)
Getting to LDS church in Manhattan today was a little easier than it was in Tuscany.  :)
@jnikkir Thanks for taking all those pictures for folks, Nikki. :)
Sea-tac airport, check out the display of my books at Gate C2 @HudsonBooks!  Find them here, SF airport, Denver, and SLC.  New York next!
If the gate C2 Sea-Tac freebies weren't enough, look at this. See those @TheDanWells books?  Yeah. I signed those too https://t.co/4ABE8UVAjq
@4AssedMonkey @tugger2k Black Prism by @brentweeks.  Promise of blood by @BrianTMcClellan.
Sea-Tac airport! The FIRST THREE who visit @HudsonBooks Gate C2 get a free Stormlight pocket guide. Ask for Sandra! https://t.co/EwOoKPyhau
Sea-Tac airport, I will sign at 2 stores. The first is by A9.  Many paperbacks &amp; 3 Arcanum Unbounded (hidden on a kiosk outside the front)
@B_Bradley_NOLA @murderbooks Should be there for Stormlight 3 next fall.
@shl It can take a week or so for places like SF.  Big hub cities, like Atlanta, go VERY fast.  Often gone in a day or two.
@robthadawg916 Well, my picture IS in all the hardcovers...  (Usually they just assume I'm the author, if I don't introduce myself )
@talbs @PorterSqBooks I'm interested, but I am in town for a convention, and it is their call.
San Francisco airport signed books: Hudson News (gate 40), Compass Books (gate 71). Also, Denver (A or B gates Tattered Cover) and SLC (C7)
@TheLindus Wow.  Makes me hope I got my ecology right enough to be believable.
@ParrishNewsom Tell him we are totally good friends and I follow you on Twitter. (Or, well, I will for long enough for you to impress them.)
If you want paperbacks of my other books or the Reckoners, look at the Compass Books by Gate 71. (San Francisco airport )
San Francisco airport!  Find signed Arcanum unbounded at the @HudsonBooks by gate 74.  It is a small news stand, but they have 4 copies.
@Femme_Sensei @HudsonBooks Next time, then.  I visit frequently.
@itsLJP Kara.  Store@brandonsanderson.com.
@RaposaBranca13 We just told my Brazil publisher that I would come to visit in 2018.  Long wait, I know, but I AM going to Brazil.
@StevenTheVictor A gates will have some, I'm sure.  The other two might be gone.
@JakeEPooh :)
Denver airport, Joe at the B gates Tattered Cover has some signed copies. Say hi for me. (Also, @HudsonBooks outside security has a handful)
@itsLJP (even if we don't normally, we can probably do it fedex for you, if you want.)
@itsLJP That's terrible.  We can send replacements.  I will ask about fedex.
Denver airport! The Tattered Cover, middle of the A gates, has TONS of signed books!  Jessica the bookseller there is great. @HudsonBooks
Adam here. Tenth Anniversary Leather Edition of Mistborn: The Final Empire + Other Goodies for the holiday season. https://t.co/dJKVH0rfzG https://t.co/RVqUcIkQZk
@Singing_Luthien I will be at London Book Fair in March. Maybe some other cities too.
@DrCapacitance email me through the form on my website. It can take a few months to respond, but we will send it.
@mordzuber It can be a little crazy. Don't get overwhelmed, though.  Most of it is Easter egg ish.
@snazzsinclair Soon! I got hit with the wheel of time in the middle of working on the second book.  Haven't quite recovered.
@Jedi_Ditka :). Hopefully no koloss fighting at the end.
Salt Lake city airport!  Gate C7 simply books has many books signed, with Epic Bookmarks inside hardcovers. Some at the desk too, if you ask
@OFirehouseBooks may not have copies of #ArcanumUnbounded for everyone outside the presentation. Contact Old Firehouse Books with questions.
Adam here Tonight's event at @ofirehousebooks is officially sold out! You can still come to the signing portion after Brandon's presentation
Brandon is heading out to the airport to start his tour for #ArcanumUnbounded. Check his full schedule here: https://t.co/zqJB4HLZKQ
Adam here. I have some great news for Denver readers who wanted to see Brandon tonight. Old Firehouse Books just released 40 more tickets!
Less than one month left to apply for my BYU writing class. Send yours in now to beat the deadline. https://t.co/F6m4ragnRa
Adam here. @audible_com has Calamity on sale for today for only $4.95! Check you region's pricing using the widget. https://t.co/PEuxVn1VmQ
@Destrus76 about a year for one this long, but that includes beta reads and copyedits.
@GrahamBeRad Probably next summer, I'd guess.
@AddamOfHull Dalinar for certain now.
@SeanCaps It will be made clear as you read through the book.
@thegentleman4 Probably The Apocalypse Guard, a follow-up to the Reckoners.
@robthadawg916 Nothing's official until it is in print, but it's unlikely to change at this point.
@Teabooksgirl Depends on which books you've read.  I suggest the printed order, unless some are spoilers.
@Jonny__Nilsson Around 1k for this book.  Some go as high as 2k instead.
@GreenOnionBlog Yay!  That's a long wait for a US Father's Day gift, though I know different countries have different dates.
Just ordered Oathbringer moved to 95% done on the website progress bar.  We're getting very, very close now.
Adam here. The Kindle edition of Alcatraz VS The Evil Librarians is priced at for just $2.99 (at least in the US)! https://t.co/fRsx5FX0Lh
@AdvanceRatio Yes, we should be doing so very soon!
@GradHawksBlog An event in bands of Mourning leads to a question, which naturally leads into Secret History. But at least read the first 3.
@GradHawksBlog You should read at least the first three, though I do suggest reading through Bands of Mourning.
Adam here. Brandon just wrote a post about his "short" story collection (Arcanum Unbounded) being released today. https://t.co/GFs0DWrQOC
The BYU Store will be giving away The Stormlight Archive Pocket Companion when you pick up your wristband today. While supplies last.
@fat_bishhh Thanks!
Oathbringer is at 93% going into the weekend.  Longer update here: https://t.co/C9HJ2GahEK
@fat_bishhh Hm...  I love the Sabriel series by Garth Nix, and it feels right about the right level for an advanced ten year old.
@ColtonBaines No, but hopefully I will be involved.
Adam here. Want to know what Brandon recommends you read while waiting for Arcanum Unbounded. Read his post here: https://t.co/cusqMQLNNm
@Screaming_Flea I get to Minnesota every now and then.  Maybe for the Stormlight 3 tour?
@TaterTheDeso It's actually much like it's written.  tv-LAH-kuv.
@SparkVGX (It's something I've planned to get into in secret history two, if I get around to writing it.)
@SparkVGX It's been three hundred years since that happened.  Events happened between then and the start of Era Two.
@GabrielePanini Afraid not.  I will be going on tour in the US for the book around that time.
@carlos_mfb It wasn't as bad as it might seem.  Only took about three hours.
@Luke_Blakeley Thanks for the kind words!  I love hearing stories like this.
@CurtGLR Some day, I promise.
@coffee_graff We packed a lot in.  Multiple stories (Emperor's Soul, Secret History, and Edgedancer) are big enough to be bound on their own
@Luke_Blakeley Those are the ones from the Weller Book Works pre-order.  They might have a few left, if you call and ask.
@W4RC0N Weller Book Works should have a few left over from the pre-ordered copies.  If you call them, they should be able to grab you one.
@ef8ffa1e1d63446 @alpha_squid I agree with this suggestion.
@VexuBet It will start once the revisions are done, which will take some time, I'm afraid.
@robthadawg916 About a year, I'm afraid.  The editing takes a long time on these.
@darci_cole Took about three years.
@RoyHartford By the end of one of these, it's smarting a little.
@MentalMegalodon No limericks.  But lots of sketches of Lift and Wyndle.
If you missed it, Stormlight 3's progress bar hit 90%! Would be more, but I spent yesterday night signing all these: https://t.co/sWz9dX57As
Adam here, Calamity and The Bands of Mourning are both finalists in the 2016 @goodreads Choice Award. Vote today! https://t.co/FUG4G9ndsC
Adam here, only two hours left until the Humble RPG Book Bundle ends! https://t.co/f1CO5U0cMx
@seyEliveD Probably fall, I'm afraid.  The longer they get, the more time editing and continuity take.
@MattOomps I had the entire Halo 2 soundtrack on repeat at one point, but it has been years now.  Still my favorite game of the series.
@DoneTheMath We'll post it soon.  We promised Tor we wouldn't do much promotion for it until Arcanum Unbounded was out. (To not distract.)
@PooyaShirazi25 Thanks!
@VanWagenenJames Took it in high school, but wouldn't say I speak it.
Brandon's assistant Karen recently wrote a post about the FAQ being live. Check it out here: https://t.co/mjgdAWg5Wf
@David_Fonti Sweet!
@CannonPowerr @Spotify I know, right?  It's kind of the unofficial theme for the book, in the back of my head.
@trevorade I do.  For some reason, it tends to go this way for me.
@sarah_kozloff ... Am I supposed to stop creating art, or stop encouraging others to do likewise, because of how the election went?
@Ashaman3000 I'm very proud of the Lift novella, and she will certainly appear in book three.
@polynikesATF But I'm afraid they're most likely all gone by now.  (Sorry.)
@polynikesATF My guess is that they're all gone, as I last signed there a month ago.  If any store has them, it's the one by Gate C7.
Stormlight 3 is going well. Hope to finish it this month, for #NaNoWriMo. This is still my playlist for the writing: https://t.co/vdzUPMmuFQ
@schelske :)
Want advice on how to get accepted into my BYU class? Here are some hints from my assistant who judges them.  https://t.co/uCla92ZWDM
@elainembak Thanks!  Enjoy.
@DavidSan1514 Nice!  Their edition is so nice.
@HoustonHomo I'll send you one, though.  It's my thank you to you for your photography skills.  :)
@HoustonHomo Yup, first week of December.  Final Empire.  It looks even better than Elantris did.
@th_laurent Very soon.  We're getting them ready.
@MsRachelAyn Afraid not.  I just don't have the time.  The YouTube videos is the best I can manage right now.
@benpa10 We're doing one of an older novel, White Sand, right now.  First part came out this summer.  If people like it, we'll do more.
@zakami07 Hopefully not that long.  (There's a post on my blog about it.)
Application deadline for my BYU class is approaching Applying sooner gives us more time to thoughtfully consider you https://t.co/F6m4ragnRa
Calamity and The Bands of Mourning both made it into the semi-final round in the 2016 @goodreads Choice Awards!  https://t.co/FUG4G9ndsC
@Zura_1I I don't know.  I'm happy to listen, though.
@Dusty_Whisper Just move forward, write the idea.  If it doesn't quite turn out, you've still learned something.  Good luck!
@Dusty_Whisper Writing isn't as much about the idea as people think.  It's about the practice and the experience.  Just write the story.
@Dusty_Whisper This is hard for me to do, because of time constraints.  But I can tell you this:  Go for it.
Small fix to the Arcanum Unbounded BYU release post. Numbers need to be picked up by 6pm on Tuesday, November 22nd. The post is now correct.
@jbgill2112 Thanks for pointing that out. By 6pm on the 22nd is correct. Post has been updated.
@jbgill2112 Whoops!  I will have my team investigate.
@Ultimate__Ace Thanks!
Details on the Arcanum Unbounded release event at BYU and how to get personalized books from Weller Book Works: https://t.co/kBAwUhqT9J
@70Guybrush Always an honor to sign a book for a mighty pirate, Mr threepwood.
On my plane in Paris, heading home at long last. Thank you for the kind reception, Europe!  Now I have a book to finish.
@beeeeseven When you come through the line, tell me so I know you made it.
@Brunoo_Roberto We are trying to find an opportunity to visit Brazil. Shouldn't be too much longer.
@beeeeseven I will watch Twitter and try not to leave until you get your books signed.
@NaffanDennison I was on a Portuguese daytime cable talk show.
Pretty sure I'm now a famous television star in Portugal.
Okay. Off to go be on Portuguese TV.  (The station is called SIC Radical, if you are watching over here.)
I'm off to my signing in Lisbon.  For now, enjoy these articles about my upcoming book:  https://t.co/EClO6zGDXJ https://t.co/NqKzEaiRAx
First teasers from the Cosmere Collection are here! https://t.co/zsQREzQAts

@mbudrovic I will look into it!
@valeryan I did last time!  And the walking lanes in the center of streets are awesome indeed.
LDS Church in Spain was very nice this morning. Got to see a lot of the city during the walk there.  Barcelona really is unique. Sad to go.

@badcrc I am!
Barcelona!  Don't forget. I'm signing here tonight.  Also, your churros and chocolate made a great breakfast. :)

Aside from Lucca, Italy today, I'll also be in Barcelona next weekend and Lisbon the Monday after that. https://t.co/zqJB4HLZKQ
Italy! Come see me at the Lucca Comics &amp; Games Festival today through Monday. https://t.co/Li99mgq2SF
Thanks for the kind words on the film deal, everyone! I'm in Italy, &amp; won't be able to respond individually to most of you. But I'm excited!
Here's some movie news that has been a long time coming. I'm thrilled to be working with DMG. https://t.co/g3UwDWfnaY
@FlyAirNZ @ladywinra Ha!  I've been diamond status on Delta, and they never tweeted me.  I'd do it just for your middle earth safety video.
@icallitart Trying!  :)
For you Italians, I DID write some of Stormlight Three in your country yesterday, before going out to see Roman ruins.
@OshiSeven Cool. Thanks for the suggestion!
@mattdoveywriter A valid point.
@weightlessamb Afraid not.  :(
I have arrived in Rome. My driver is playing very dramatic Italian disco ballads on the radio.
Found my way to a very nice LDS chapel in Paris, right near Notre Dame. Surviving jet lag quite well this time.
Ready for my signing in Paris!  Looks like a nice crowd.  Will start in about fifteen min.
@theattoyemd We have had interest.  Nothing we can talk about yet.
Hello, Paris. See you tonight at La Dimension Fantastique.  Q&amp;A and singing. 6:30-8:00pm.
@lkjsdfoinmf We are willing.  Tor has to Okay it, though.
@Skeletor022 Usually right away.  Call Duane at the university Bookstore for details, though.
@Manahil8704 I will see what I can do. :)
@rockysaurio Barcelona in two weeks.  Details on my website.
@Un0ri London Book Fair.  April, I believe.
@delGiorgio_P Barcelona has Eurocon, which is why I'm going there.  I will do Madrid next time, I promise.
@Manahil8704 Toronto next spring, I believe.
@shadowbladespai I will be in Barcelona in two weeks.  Details on my website.
@ladywinra I am hitting Australia in June.  I keep thinking I should visit New Zealand too.

@BJJaveri My pleasure.  It is humbling to know that, once in a while, the things I try in the books end up doing what I hoped they would.
@JackRioch I think I have one that he rejected.  Not sure if I have the one that worked.  But I'll look into it.  Good suggestion.
@Dekar173 :)  You really are my favorite, though.  (Just don't tell the others.)
@natalieamyC Thank you for supporting me.  I get to do it because of people like you!
@dat_emu It is my honor.
@Lord_Talismano I'm there multiple days.  All weekend, I think.
@DanielScott128 An honour indeed.  That's what books have always been to me, and is one of the most satisfying things to see in mine.
@DanielScott128 Someone sent that to me a while back, which is why I've kept an eye on her.
@NaffanDennison Glad to hear it.  Take care of yourself.
@joelcobbs (Though it does feel like I live there sometimes, doesn't it?)
@joelcobbs ATL books go quickly. They're often gone a day or two after I sign them.
@joelcobbs Ha!  Well, tell her to look through the bookstores I tweeted about a few weeks back--but don't spent too much time.
@paullavender6 @BJJaveri Yeah, I always say to my wife, "I'm sorry your fish are dead" because it feels like the best way to say it.
@NaffanDennison Yeah, I'm fine.  Seriously.  My wife is the one with depression, which is why I write about it.
@tritlo Yeah, I saw that immediately. Sigh. Well, there are worse things in the world than making people think about people with depression.
@Ind3pendent7 :(  So sorry.
@mspencerbailey That was a reply to another tweet that lost its @. Sorry for the confusion.

@paullavender6 @BJJaveri Yeah. Family members still get kicked in the face by this periodically. Have you read this: https://t.co/xBTjKjObux
@PockyandSake There is a Marvel character with the name. Their powers are very different from Stephen's, so I'm curious how this plays out.
I don't normally retweet fan campaigns, but depression and mental illness are things I specifically deal with in my books. Have a look. https://t.co/NGTuvSxMVX
@BJJaveri I'm heartbroken to hear about this, Averi. As someone with loved ones who have depression, I can only guess at your pain.
@dylan_gelbard Sorry.  I decided the book would be longer than originally projected, so the current writing hasn't budged the percentage.
My 3 and 6 yr olds are rolling on the ground laughing because a speaker at LDS Church conference said "tutor" and they heard "tooter."
GraphicAudio has released the first part of their full-cast audio dramatization of The Bands of Mourning.  https://t.co/j7x0gn74aN
@Sw1shaaTweets It was an honor.
@DatingRev I'll do my best.  Thanks for the kind words.
@MorpheusStone It's part of the job, unfortunately.  Like saying if an actor would just not go on talk shows, they could do more films.
@Rajani_Isa That's really interesting. Thanks for passing it along.  I'm curious how this will shake out.
@_allex23 Drehy the bridgeman is gay, and we will meet a romantic interest for him in the next book. There are others.
@daimonionen That's really strange.  Do you have a different browser you could try?  You're the only one I'm getting this comment from.
@daimonionen That's very odd.  What if you try getting to it by clicking on your own from this page: https://t.co/FutJ41RD7s
@Jedizora Yes.  I wish I could get it out this year, but it's just not going to happen.  Next year for certain, though.
@SlvrStrs This wasn't directly on my mind while writing, but looking back, I think it was in my subconscious. I'm flattered to hear it.
@Widdi_05 I'm always on the hunt for a new idea that excites me, and usually a story is a combination of several "aha" moments.
@daumari But: 140 characters.  :\
@daumari Yeah, I meant to link it before I left.  I was going to write something like, "Here's my latest update, from a few weeks ago."
@SmashG0D Probably 2018, I'm afraid.  Stormlight has been consuming all my time recently.
@daumari Sorry.  I've been out of the country for two weeks, so that's the most recent one I have.
@BrentLooyenga Probably about a year.  Maybe a little less.
@Widdi_05 Apocalypse Guard has some mild connections, and there will probably be a Mizzy book someday.
@PyromanticVIII Thanks!  Hopefully, it still holds up, after all these years.
@jasonw Hmmm.  @PeterAhlstrom do you know anything about this?
@BrianTMcClellan I generally feel more Orko than He-Man...
@BrentWeeks :)   ...  Sorry about that whole Tor stealing your editor thing.
@BrentWeeks I do tend to get things done, but this series has been gone two and a half years without a sequel, so I do bear some guilt also.
@RoyHartford Novella, then Apocalypse Guard.
Back from the conference, and ready to buckle down and finish Stormlight 3 over the next month or two. Update here: https://t.co/upgoE9OvYa
@loodyvip I love all my readers, you included.
@BlingdomJ My pleasure.
@LauraRenshaw1 @HudsonBooks Yes, Hudson in particular has been great about having them in stock.  I sign whatever I can find.
@tritlo Sorry about that...
@HElliott_Writes High Five!
@BlingdomJ :) Central region has some French instead.

@JohnnyJochum Look on the stormlight archive Reddit group.
@argel1200 Rafo!  :)
@ladywinra I know. I keep missing it because my publisher always brings me to Australia only.
@LCFC_2016_PSV Paris is as close as I will be anytime soon, I'm afraid.
@FranWongWrites Usually!  I am kind of legendary in the Atlanta airport by now, so they all know to watch for me.
F Gates Simply Books Atlanta airport has many Sanderson books.  Some in SF, some in Teen. Ran out of stickers to hide inside. (Sorry.)
@im_star_stuff not so far...
@ghostdoctor30 :)
@brettwolfelodge It has always been "Mistborn: the final empire." But some printings leave off the subtitle. It's 50/50.
@dsharp524 Soon ish.
Atlanta b gates Buckhead Books has my Wheel of Time books and Calamity, all signed.
@sumpfy Little far for me right now. But I will be at the Lucca Festival in a month or so in Italy.
@joshvice many times. :)
Also, Atlanta airport in the middle of the A gates. Simply Books.  Many signed copies.

Salt lake city airport is fully restocked with signed books!  Gate C6. They have all 5 Alcatraz books in hardcover including the new one!
My three boys were given shirts for the Dark Talent release today.  I think they will grow into them... https://t.co/Sefj7DokE7
Signing today at the springville library!  Bring your own books or buy them here. My talk at 3 is full. At 4:00 though all are welcome.
Alcatraz 5: The Dark Talent is out now!  https://t.co/dIrfv3YdfG
On my way to the King's English for the signing tonight!  We even flew the illustrator out. Stop by and see us!  6pm.
@Adam_Kroeker Keep the secret ending a secret.  I'll be doing a blog post about it next week. :)
Salt Lake! I and illustrator Hayley Lazo will be signing at The King's English at 6PM today. https://t.co/zjx331rQOX https://t.co/fyg3pwTfYw
The Dark Talent is now available in hardcover and ebook! (The audiobook is delayed a few weeks, unfortunately.) https://t.co/DKSE14xwNV
@codehawkfalcon I'm on my plane waiting to fly off, I'm afraid.
Atlanta airport E gates Heritage Books (new name) also has signed books, all the way in the back. I got the A gates simply books on Thursday
Atlanta airport. F gate simply books has lots of signed books with prizes inside. Say hi to Kaleta the Bookseller for me.
There are a few seats left for my dragon con reading. (We moved it to a larger room.). Hyatt International ballroom South. (I think.)
Dragon con.  Want to draft with me and Dan Wells tonight? First come first served. Tweet @Karasmatically to get on the list.
RT live stream of my panel (hopefully) @dragonmount: LIVE on #Periscope https://t.co/kmN8zGKLKT
I'm doing panels at Dragon Con again today, including my big Q&amp;A. If you missed it, here's my full schedule: https://t.co/nFONbXZ4oL
@DJ_Gloomy_Bear A pretty good film, actually. You can stream it any place that sells on demand videos.
@BrokenKnives Not sure. If I do, it will be Sunday night.
Dragon Con! Tonight at 5:30, Dan has a free screening of Not A Serial Killer film. I'll be there &amp; interview him! Hyatt International North.
@yakeyonsen No, unfortunately.
@hometeacher it's like a mega-comic con.
Atlanta airport has signed books, middle of the A gates, simply books. Prizes inside! (I will do the other bookstores on Monday )
@BrianTMcClellan Oh? They wouldn't let you in then? Sorry to hear that.
@AaronToponce We go way back.  Remember that time we went spelunking?  Good times.
On my way to dragoncon.  Stopped by the Salt Lake airport bookstore, gate C7, and signed a stack of books!
I am going to try and post periodic book reviews on my Goodreads account. You can see more details here: https://t.co/mnuNyoaU3u
@codemonkey1972 Excellent!  Remind me of this conversation.
@TruettAMcDaniel My pleasure.  Keep writing!
@coffee_graff @torbooks It's not off the table, but I can't say for certain if I will do more or not.
@kielmcginty &lt;Takes a bow.&gt; Many thanks.
@codemonkey1972 I'd love to meet him.
@JRPokle @AaronBentzel Uh...
@TheAOster ...Huh.  That's cool.
@Allchiefedup We've considered it.
@INukeYou [Cackles manically]
@Swifthom My pleasure.  Thanks for reading!
@nutsocharles I will try! (And you can always see if you can pry the answer out of Maria.  She can answer things I cannot.)
@nutsocharles This is one of the few things I'm not allowed to answer.  (It's not my choice whether or not to reveal it.)
@mdenzinger @Gollancz I think it will be available eventually, but will be exclusive to the collection for a little while.
@_PastorAndrew Going great!
@golddaveberg Ha.  Guilty.  I forgot to send the update email to the team on Monday.  I'll do that sometime today.
@Frodo_Geek @DragonCon I think I have a signing at my booth that day.
@HawgBob I don't think there's enough there, that you don't already know, to make it interesting.  I'm more interested in the future.
@G_Bloodworth @torbooks That's some good company you have me in.
@Hannah_Marie_39 I'm feeling like I might get to it soon, but no promises yet.
@Jeff_Autrey I'm afraid I'm doing EuroCon and DragonCon this year, rather than NYCC. :(
@RyanBruckman Sure.  I'd probably ask Brian McClellan or Brent Weeks to do it, if in that situation. I don't know if either would have time.
@JRo0426 You'd get a much worse series if that were the case... :)
@Kinesia23 @howardtayler Thanks!  Hope it's useful to you.
@alliesugar I love the Oxford comma.  Does that get me points?
@wulfsdale Most have been, but it's been slow going actually getting any of them made.
@The1stAge Afraid I didn't find any.  Is there a bookstore hiding somewhere I should have been able to find?
@5aleesi Happy birthday!  May you have a wonderful day, and many more years to follow, each of them involving a tweet from me.  :)
On my way to Kansas City for the Hugos. Salt Lake airport simply books, gate C7, has signed books!
@TaylortheReader I find that letting my cat dance across it works even better.
@playstationsupe Let's see where I am when I finish.  That's years away, still.  :)
@Ashaman3000 But in my first decade I did ten cosmere novels plus three WoT, so it's not THAT crazy.
@Ashaman3000 Tell me about it. (Though it's two more Elantris and one more Warbreaker.)
@TheeAlbinoRhyno That will be the publisher's call.  But I'd expect fall sometime.
@eleventy17 Yes.  Two sets of five, with book five marking an ending to one sequence.
@RamirezTrigger Thanks!  Enjoy.
Stormlight 3 is at 71% now, and moving very consistently.  Still expecting to finish sometime in October. (For a release next year.)
@edjoeheras That's some good company you've put me in.  :)
@scalzi @JamesSACorey @jameslsutter Wow!  This gives me an idea for a brand new epic fantasy series.  Thanks, guys!
@V2Phil It was my honor.
@BrendanCole87 Rutabaga!
@rosie_lajenky :)
In this week's Writing Excuses episode, @veschwab joins us to talk about Crossover Fiction. https://t.co/vKsm9Q0RgO
@tordotcom is offering readers a free download of The Stormlight Archive Pocket Companion through the Tor/Forge Blog https://t.co/1cTTge6Afk
@Rothiray Enjoy!  Glad to do it.  People like you quietly make the internet a better place.
@RealmOfOblitus I'm humbled to hear it!  Good luck!
#Firefight was selected to be featured in @audible_com's Much Loved Listens #BOGO sale! Now through August 22nd. https://t.co/N6i1NM0g6F
@PeterAhlstrom @argel1200 Dragons are mythological on Nalthis, but there is a reason that the stories exist.  It's not a translation quirk.
@JBeauSpeaks @neilhimself :)  Please tell me that's your assigned reading for a class.
@Classicsmiley I think we'll do one eventually. Might be a year or two.
In this week's Writing Excuses episode, we discuss the element of humor. https://t.co/dStQjBfgaP
@Frannie_Pan @LuccaCandG I'm pretty sure I'm there the weekend of the 29th, then several days into the next week.
Lecture #8 from my writing class this year is up! #7 went up last week, if you missed it. https://t.co/UXPZ1hyBYx
@Lott128 ...to a solo release.  That said, I'll bet the ebook of the collection goes on sale after about a year, too. So keep an eye on that
@Lott128 There will be a paperback a year after release, probably priced at $8.  But yeah, I wish I'd been able to get them to agree (more)
@TheWhisperGamer The form on my website is best, but warning, it can take a while--and I can't even get to those all the time.
@Lott128 There will, but not for a few years.  Tor required exclusivity for a time, in order to do the anthology.
@zofox2 I'd go with Rust and Ruin or Storms.
@hitseeker_ Thanks!
@Nicole_whateven I don't consider it finished, but I might let an anthology print it, if they're really eager for some flash fiction.
@McClintockart @khalyusr It was very impressive!  Thanks for sharing it.
@neversaytop Book three is probably not until mid-late year next year.
@neversaytop You can pray...but the reason I wrote the Stormlight novella for Arcanum Unbounded was to apologize for making you wait.
@docmon67 We took it down briefly to change ownership to the publisher. @torbooks promised they'd have it up soon. @mxpalmieri
@LID919 We took it down briefly to change ownership to the publisher. @torbooks promised they'd have it up soon. @mxpalmieri
Moved the Oathbringer bar up two points, to 69% done! Celebrate by enjoying at this incredible Stormlight cosplay: https://t.co/4t9hXNCIsn
@KnightReader Only about a month now!
@G_Whitney_Leigh :)  It shouldn't be too much longer before I get to it.
@jazzexile We sneak them in, on occasion, to bring awareness to the Librarian cover-up.
@MatthewPrince14 Stormfather!
@TysonMoll It was removed temporarily as I transfer rights to my publisher, for the collection. They promised to put it back up soon.
I was sent a fun survey by some readers and thought I would share. Enjoy! https://t.co/d5VJC7HSl5
@AnnatarLG Yes.
@JohnnyJochum Thanks!
@lyonaria There will be more!  Sometime after I finish the last Wax and Wayne book.
In this week's Writing Excuses episode, Trina Marie Phillips joins us to talk about Futurism. https://t.co/5EWN5Co0bJ
@johanlang1337 I've planned some more stories in that world.
@TuleyCorn These are glossy poster types.  We have prints of other things on the store, I think, that are more high quality.
@GavinZanker It is my pleasure, Gavin.  Keep writing!
@nixhaus Thanks!  You're a potato in a mine field.
@utefan143  Chapter Five is a good example of the level of violence in the series.  Maybe glance through that one?
@utefan143 It really depends on your comfort level with the violence in the series.  In that regard, it does get dark at times.
@TadeuAratel My pleasure!  Keep writing.
Lecture #7 from my writing class this year is up! #6 went up last week, if you missed it.  https://t.co/mC7XPrItLX
@CharlesHorikami Yes, it's important.  I will get into it some day.
The new Elantris maps poster set is now available in my online store!  https://t.co/mWiIgZ9xCo https://t.co/sCdsEQUDa8
@maybe_bird It's between books that I take breaks.  Next break will be after Oathbringer, where I'll write the Apocalypse Guard.
@neversaytop  By the end of next year for sure.  I'm far enough along that it would take a lot to stop it. Doubt it can happen this year.
@DavidAlanHorn :)
@KillJodi Love it!  Thanks for taking the time to send it to me.
@KillJodi Nice!
@DavidAlanHorn Lopen just finished chapter one at 6,000 pages.  He just finished describing himself.
@AdamuEJ It was Elantris. I put the deleted sequence on my website. Mistake was adding a new conflict and antagonist too late in the book.
@DGubics We'll pick that once it's all finished, and the publisher can look over the schedule. Probably next fall.
@CoopJodwa @PatrickRothfuss Secretly, we're just waiting for Half Life 3 to come out before releasing our third parts.
@DonnovanKidwell @BrianTMcClellan Brian's an old student of mine.  I'm hoping he doesn't someday go all Vader on me.
@AdamuEJ Can you remind me of the context?  Which book was I talking about?
@_TestBot The closer I get to the end, the faster it goes, as I work things out in the outline as I go.
@BrianTMcClellan I actually tried changing to Whiny-McWhinerson, but apparently you'd already done all the paperwork, so I left it to you.
@NevermoreGames @cheveedodd I've been twice, in the past.  I do plan to go again some year.
@Anccestral Thanks!
@spidermenz First Draft, unfortunately
@lets_meet_there Yes, it's Dalinar.
@Justin_T_Call About 2k-3k words a day on average.
@Knappppank :)
@SeedyStoryist Everything else is intended to be a bonus, for ease of collection going forward.
@SeedyStoryist Basically, the price is for Edgedancer and Secret History. (Which together are the length of a normal novel.)
@SeedyStoryist I wanted to include every piece of cosmere short fiction so far.  The book isn't more expensive because of it.
Oathbringer (Stormlight 3) just inched past the 2/3rds mark.  67% done, as per the percentage bar, updated as of today.
@triathletewms :)
@AymanTeaman First draft is just as I write it.  Making sure the writing hits a quality standard will happen in editing.
@KillJodi Nice!  I like that one the best of the three.
@CornerCritic Enjoy!  They're my best work, but they do require a little patience.
@adkeith80 Book.  Particularly if you can make the first stand on its own, which you should be trying to do.
@aquemini182 Something I'm trying very hard to stay below. (I'll likely fail on this one.)
@robert_mee I haven't had a chance to play it yet.
@rrvirdi My pleasure.  Good luck with your books!
@kanjymyhoorbru It is my pleasure.
@robert_mee No word yet, but I'm sure it will be extensive.
@rrvirdi 60k in a month is fantastic for anyone.  Most months I only get 40k.
@mrkhlm 400k starts with 500 words.  Do that consistently, and you'll be surprised at how quickly it goes.
@Bre_Faucheux Series take longer to revise, page for page.  Stormlight will spend about a year in revisions; shorter books, six months.
@Gary0wen__ It was an honor.
Just ticked the percentage bar for Stormlight three up to 65%. 260k words written of a projected 400k final.
@HowlingSeaDog We talked about putting them up as podcasts.  I'll talk to my video guy, and say there's at least one person asking.
Lecture #6 from my writing class this year is up! #5 went up last week, if you missed it. https://t.co/WXTdJuaWBJ
For my European readers (or those interested in going to Italy this fall!) I will be at the #LuccaCandG festival. https://t.co/ChyYluSUZE
@shnar No, I didn't--but I should look it up.
@BillVaz Writing between 2k and 3k.  Revising, between 10k and 20k, depending on how difficult the section is.
@AdorableAaronB Afraid not.  I'm at Dragon*Con this year instead.
@KatieHadgis You're...welcome?
@shnar This was on the flight home from Dubai, when I didn't have access to the materials I needed for Stormlight. :)
@Frannie_Pan &lt;takes a bow&gt;
@_curtis_n No, this is a Science Fiction story. Edgedancer, the novella in the collection this fall, is cosmere. (Stormlight, actually.)
@BillSmily Yup!  Should be this Christmas.
Good news! You can now preorder the limited edition of my new novella #Snapshot! https://t.co/6G1ASX9XbM
@AIndoria @davidfarland Ah, that makes sense.  Well, if I design some asteroids in the future, I'll make sure you get one... :)
@AIndoria @davidfarland Well, I don't make them particularly hard to get... :)  And I wasn't sure why you included Dave too.
@Acediar I do.  I wrote over a dozen before I actually sold one.
@yafeshan I'm fine--I enjoy my work, which makes it easier.  I often write at nights; it's a habit I've had for decades.
@Raven1908 I generally write from midnight to four, then sleep until noon, so it's cool.
@JoelDehlin One step at a time.
@AIndoria @davidfarland One what, exactly?
@pm230831 Yes.  Book Three.
Family is all asleep, and I have finished signing books in the warehouse for those who ordered them from my website. Finally time to write.
@EarthNerdAdkins &lt;Takes a bow&gt;
@axtimusprime Impressive!  Nice work.
@MeowzerTehBeast Looks great on the forearm like that.
@scifan3 Warform, I believe.
@thirdchildart Sweet!
@QuestFloorCare @LindseyStirling I've got a piece or two by Lindsey on my writing playlist for the next book, though I don't think we've met
@SmellyLlama Thanks!
@MrJMusic Yes, you will--but I want to do a more modern technology version first.
@Dear_Godot @thelindywest Enjoy!
@HuwJordan333 It's one of those things that I might be able to talk about some day, but not quite yet.
@authorlindsayc I certainly envy the location!
@happyindulgence You have chosen wisely, obviously.
@M_A_Roman Good luck!
@kevinyoufool :)
@somebodyofthe I've been invited, but haven't been able to make it work in the schedule yet.  Hopefully, it will happen in the near future.
@EddyCurant Oooh.  Nifty!
@jndub The sequel is called Words of Radiance.  I'm working on Book Three now.
@aLatinaReader My pleasure!  Thanks for reading.
3 hours left to back the Mistborn board game Kickstarter campaign. https://t.co/T0Bg651cqZ
@alitoots43 I've signed in both!  (As recently as last fall, I believe.)  I'm sure to visit again, perhaps next spring.
@cassie_lb I did enjoy it...but I'm back in the States now.
@NouraNoman I was, but not any longer.  (Emily and I visited for our tenth anniversary.)
@angelsk @Waterstones @WaterstonesTCR :)  It was quite the stealthy trip all around.  Didn't even tell my publisher or agent.
@metunnica No, I'm actually back home by now.  Wife and I a quick trip over to see some shows, but didn't tell anyone.
@gjn0rse It became a habit, and I've just kept doing it.
@gjn0rse Early in my career, I got accustomed to signing books wherever I found them, as I felt I needed every edge I could get to sell.
London! @Waterstones Tottenham Court Road (@waterstonesTCR) has stealth-signed books. (Don't ask how I got there.) https://t.co/ML9uswtDxL
@darci_cole @howardtayler I saw the ones you gave to Mary and Dan.  Quite nice!

@LuckDragn I'd suggest going to a convention someplace close, though, and seeing if you can meet other writers there.
@LuckDragn You can sometimes find very good readers, with an editorial mindset, who don't write themselves who are good members.
@darci_cole Kind of.  You can have a slow pace and good sense of progress at the same time, though.
@VeesBooks &lt;takes a bow&gt;
@King_of_Whirl Afraid I use Word.  But I have friends that love it.
Lecture #3 from my writing class this year is up! #2 went up last week, if you missed it. https://t.co/GADTlE2uG6
Finished the next big chunk of Stormlight 3, formally completing Part Two (of five, though part five will be short.) Looking good so far!
@lsv Congrats!
Off to my signing at Dragon's Keep Orem!  Time on my website was 7, but that was wrong.  (I will stay late just in case. Real time is 5.)
@mattwalsh12 I will be here a few hours so don't worry. Should die down in a sec.
@KFord_85 Afraid not. But I will be here for two hours, so you can wait until it dies down and call.  :(
@amooresiue13 This is the graphic novel.  An excerpt will be in the collection.
@SOM1better Yes they will be numbered.
If you want a copy of White Sand personalized, numbered and shipped to you, you can call the B&amp;N within the next two hours: 801-282-1324
@rapso_2 It was an honor.
@konet_prime A year, hopefully.
@krizazy :)  This is the second version, which I wrote four years later, that thankfully wasn't quite so bad as the first version.
@bgbond It should be on digital platforms.  I know people have been grabbing it on Kindle.
@kthulhu89 It is!
@pryto11 Brilliant, but strange.
@mystyk_jade @mad_grrroupie Wow!  That turned out really well.
White Sand the graphic novel is out! I believe B&amp;Ns are carrying it. I've heard that many comic shops don't get new books until Wed, though.
@haventheft Yay!
@skreece1 My family went up, but I stayed home for writing group. So it's not me, I'm afraid. (I've been to the parade before, though.)
@JoshSHill @PeterAhlstrom If Peter doesn't contact you, then wait a week until he's back, and try again. I'm happy to have him send one.
@tqy_tqg_tql (Though on occasion, it's just a mistake or lapse on my part.  Those we fix. The rest drive my editors crazy.)
@tqy_tqg_tql On occasion, you'll see me having characters miss-quote themselves, or remember events clearly wrong. I do this for realism.
@tqy_tqg_tql This is a thing that drives Peter crazy. My research tells me that people change memories based on expectations and environment
@JoshSHill My assistant @PeterAhlstrom would give this one out, as it's self-published. Though he's going on vacation next week.
@w0lfwood Yeah, I still go back and forth on this one.
@Klynne0326 Yup, you'd fit right in.
The second annotation for Perfect State (spoilers!) is now posted, about the consequences of cutting the epilogue. https://t.co/n9bDLl1FHZ
@MMOGC Congrats.  There are secrets we didn't print in the ARC of Book Five, FYI.  (To keep them extra secret.)
@AdamuEJ A mixture of both. The thieving crew names came from getting into Kelsier's head, and letting him name people.
@MylaMalinalda Unlikely, I'm afraid.
@RoyHartford I tried doing them for TWOK, and yes, they were just draining too much writing time.  :(
@Shaitaan_Slayer My pleasure.
The first annotation for my deleted scene from Perfect State (spoilers!) is now up. https://t.co/TAt1EG6dIW
@AllocDK @TribalInstincts I second Hyperion, though it's VERY different from my books. Far more literary; mind bending in a good way.
@Gwanna105th Hard at work on #3!  Until then, there's a novella about Lift coming out this fall.
@NouraNoman Sorry for the late reply.  Yes, I read it!  Started on the plane flight home, and finished a few weeks later. :)
@itslaurarose Some day soon, I hope to be able to write it.  The outline is done, and is solid.
@itslaurarose Sorry.  Rithmatist 2 was delayed by me doing the Wheel of Time, and I've never quite gotten back on track for it.
@amyengle_author Only changes are artistic, and the occasional fix of a typo.
@saulmarq Congrats, and great job!

@NouraNoman Wow!  That's awesome.  (I enjoyed your book, by the way, Noura.  Thanks for sharing it with me.)
@Destrus76 Yes, we should be doing so (in conjunction with a local bookseller.)
@MaxiCilauro Not yet.  We should include one of those in a book.  I'll see what I can do.
@Un0ri I can't promise, but it is on my list of things I'd like to do someday.
@joshuarhall Yes, a little.  Korean was a bigger inspiration for Aonic (in Elantris) though.
@MrVicBam Man, what I wouldn't give to see that happen...  :)

@vilecreature666 Totally cool with me.  What an honor!  Thanks.
@toadmill73 Tasty, tasty books.
@iamportelance In the original draft of The Way of Kings from 2002, Renarin created the Diagram.
@Omar_Haroon I don't believe RJ said in his notes. At this point, I'm not in a place to make cannon, so...you will have to imagine it.
@R_E_DRichardson @TheDanWells That's an interesting parallel.  I'd never considered that.

@YoungbergCody :) Much appreciated.
@jet_set I only just saw that you all had replied.  :)  I shot a reply to him.
@jaredturner P.S. my kids envy the trampoline and the foam pit. :)
@jaredturner I had trouble finding copies that weren't already sighed, though!  So we might have met already.
@jaredturner Hi!  Sorry for the late reply. Got busy with doing some writing. The home was awesome. I particularly liked seeing my books. :)
@emmarie212002 For me, it's about good habits, small measurable goals, and small rewards given in a timely way.
@emmarie212002 I believe productivity has more to do with knowing yourself than anything else.
@emmarie212002 Sorry for the late reply.  It boils down to figuring out your personal psychology, and what motivates you.
@oraymw Sorry for the late reply, but yes.  She is.
@Jeffcaddell Enjoy!
@Mark_UNC Other than that: Mistborn, Stormlight, Warbreaker, Elantris, and White Sand (graphic novel, coming out later this month.)
@Mark_UNC The short story collection Arcanum Unbounded out this fall will include every scrap of short fiction published so far.
@Kirstie_Earlene glad to hear it!  I have recorded the ones from this year, and should be posting them starting next week.

@MrVicBam Thanks so much!
@AmmarJava I have to finish it first, then put it through probably about a year of revisions and continuity edits.  So next year sometime.
@rip327 It's intended for the Cosmere short fiction collection coming out this fall.
@K33pOnRollin \[T]/
@Mark0fNothing I'm going to the Lucca festival this fall.
@cvdks Finished.  Needs revisions.
@Dizturb3dwun My pleasure.
@whalladay My pleasure!  Give my best to your son.
@AdamuEJ A little of both. In some cases, it's more front loaded, but there is always tweaking during the drafting process.
Just told my assistant to move the Stormlight 3 percentage bar up 2 points, reflecting work I did this week. Have a nice weekend everyone!
Utah folks! I'll be at the @BN_Orem on Saturday for the inaugural B-Fest. #BFestBuzz https://t.co/eT5R2AuHKt https://t.co/1cb7RVv4eX
The Rithmatist ebook is now on sale at $1.99 (at least in the US). https://t.co/qns53dPlK6 https://t.co/xxl8kacwuZ
Today's the last day to pick up the Elantris ebook for $2.99 (in the US). Plus updates: https://t.co/RAupuHr0dW https://t.co/h14awzCikG
Very cool. @David_Fonti rendered himself in Shardplate in this video: https://t.co/EIHbStcJro
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist https://t.co/Hg18MrFK9R Shardplate Final Composite
I have one signing today at Phoenix comic con. In the signing lounge at 4:30. Stop by my booth (1378) first for exclusive items and freebies
@AndrewH_Lumin Had to make it not *quite* the Westin as I didn't know the back rooms well enough.  But it is basically there. :)
@Skoba21 Not much to report.  Might still happen, but going slowly.
First Phoenix comic con signing: 4:00, booth 1378. Dan will be here too. Exclusive item this con: Elantris map trio! https://t.co/uZ2bijgdlS
@grace_teraberry I have several signings, so there should be a chance. :)
@damienphoenix One year or so.  Half done with the writing part, but editing on these is a beast.
@EirikHavre Thanks!
@Gwanna105th &lt;takes a bow&gt;
@macy_chris I am doing plenty of signings, so hopefully it works out!
@Hobbesworth A good plan.
I am on my way to Phoenix! (Signing tonight, comic con this weekend.) Left signed books in the SLC airport Bookstore! (Gate C6)
Phoenix! Tonight I'm at the Poisoned Pen with a ton of authors. And this weekend is Phoenix Comicon. See you there! https://t.co/hUSHd89gww
For the next week, the Elantris 10th anniversary ebook is on sale at $2.99 (at least in the US). https://t.co/whXK4kcNY4
The Way of Kings $2.99 ebook sale ends on May 30th. Plus other news: https://t.co/e5wSeMTDXl
Want to go on the Writing Excuses cruise with me &amp; my cohosts? The rates go way up after May 31st, so register now! https://t.co/WBcWqmfY2W
Nice little display for Alcatraz 3 at the Orem B&amp;N, so I signed them and hid some random swag inside. :) https://t.co/59flzLLWqq
On June 11 I'll be doing #BFest at the Orem B&amp;N. @SabaaTahir at 1:00, me at 4:00, and @TheDanWells at 6:00 https://t.co/hq8STAbE6C @BNBuzz
For anyone interested, I just hid a signed postcard in a copy of Alcatraz 2 in the American Fork library.
If you have an Audible credit in your account, you can see that Steelheart is in their 2-for-1 sale this weekend: https://t.co/XXrHkYPlI1
@5aleesi My pleasure!  Thanks for your awesome support, Asma.
@byreneewaring It's not really up to me.  I sold the rights, and now it's up to Fox to make a film. I'm optimistic.
@ericpeters I've only posted two, as we only just started this.  If you can read Snapshot and Lift, you've got it all so far.
@ericpeters Just for my confirmation, can you see last month's posts as well?
@ericpeters You'll have to wait until the novella gets released in the fall to read the whole thing.
@RebelliousNavs In the collection of Cosmere stories coming out in the fall.
@ericpeters But it's not a full novella--it's a scene I'm working on, with commentary on what's not working about it.
@ericpeters I believe if you pledge now, you will get to read what I posted this month and last month.
@deva_marie I believe it is possible too.
@jesanidrew I'm very pleased with the way the producers are taking the film, so I think we'll be in good shape. Thanks for the kind words!
@deva_marie Also, I make an effort to include my children, taking them to signings and events.  That helps a lot too.
@deva_marie For me, I had to make strict rules about a period in the day when I'm not allowed to be thinking about writing.
@deva_marie It's still a challenge, as writing (and most arts) can dominate your entire life, if you let them.
@jesanidrew Go for it!  The rights are with Fox, and hopefully, they'll get a greenlight before too long.
If you like behind-the-scenes, I posted a first (failed) start to a Stormlight novella for Random Hat level patrons: https://t.co/HEgXteWHPD
In church, my 6yr old made this, as normal tic tac toe is "too boring." (He then put an 0 around it all and ”won.") https://t.co/eRghR80aZb
@SandervanZanten It was an honor.
@shllybkwrm Yeah, the Buckhead books usually doesn't have many.  The Simply Books locations generally have more.  :(
Aside from Perfect State, Mitosis is also at 99¢ (in the US for sure) this month. https://t.co/N6VhdXL8k9
@russellmbrown 4000 words--so closer to twenty manuscript pages.  Pace should be around 2.5% a week, once the Stormlight novella is done.
@robthadawg916 My pleasure.
Moving up to 52% done on Stormlight 3.  I've also added some tracks to the playlist I listen to while writing: https://t.co/vdzUPMmuFQ
@ayeadruhn I have plans to do something more with the universe.
@Brisco428 Those are very cool!
@CandyflossGoth There will be one more with Wax, Marasi, and company.  :)
@sheMehay A different book of mine, Warbreaker, has a free ebook on my website.
@mikezentz Thanks!
@pikemarsh All are in the portion of the gates central to the concourse, with the escalators. Check YA as well as sf/f.  :)
@pikemarsh I hear that the B gate one is sold out.  So look at the Simply Books in the A or F gates, or the NYT bookstore in the E gates.
@Nooevve I've been to Oslo once, but it was a few years back.  Would love to get back some day!
@AJMO539 Also, it's a big center of Wheel of Time fandom, with Jordancon being held there every year.
@AJMO539 I fly Delta, because SLC is a Delta hub, and ATL is their biggest hub. So I connect through there very, very often.
In case you missed it last week, ATL airport (A, B, E, F Gates) and SLC airport (C gates) have plenty of signed Sanderson books.
@timothystarner They just need to make sure not to skimp on editing or cover.
@timothystarner It's a solid way to build a career these days, and should not be ignored as a possibility.
@Tee_1UP I have plans, but can't lock myself in too much until the outline for Mizzy's book is done.
Scott's cover looks great on the third Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians books! https://t.co/idXTJ4qWDr
@Tee_1UP I wanted to be vague because I need to have freedom to tweak them when I write a follow-up.
My Hugo Award-nominated standalone novella Perfect State is now on sale at 99¢ worldwide https://t.co/cwfyKaw8q5 https://t.co/5neCCcYCf4
It's Independent Bookstore Day! Some stores have the Stormlight Archive Companion. https://t.co/LzMOXMDDTv
@CrazyAboutMtg I mostly draft, whatever the latest set is, or one of my cubes.
@MichaelofNorth It's a collection of artwork from the inside of the Stormlight Archive novels, I believe. All of that is on my website.
@realSEyOda @PeterAhlstrom That's basically what Forgery always does.
@elektrotal @PeterAhlstrom If we get any, I'll save one for you.
@elektrotal @PeterAhlstrom It's basically just art from the books, bound together--though it looks very nice.
@elektrotal @PeterAhlstrom I don't know if we'll have any. It's a thing Tor did for the indies--we just looked it over and approved it.
@acodyclancy @nkuedu Give them my best!  This was really fun to see.
@Sobh_M @CHESTERCOBOOK @BookstoreDay It's a collection of the art from the books, which is already on-line.
@acodyclancy These are awesome!  Thanks for showing them to me!
@bhobbes I don't have any information to share.  Sorry.  :(
@hansenviz Pretty excited!
@ArbiterFabulous Yeah, I love that hat, but I never convinced myself that I could pull it off.  Wearing it was short lived.  Sigh.
@_i_an Yes, it will.
@TBvalasco There will be more in the universe, but I don't want to say much yet.
@PGeorge9601 Not likely by Christmas, I'm afraid.  I've been writing on it for eight months, and have only just barely hit half way.
@_i_an Yes.
@hunterhon Afraid no good news.
@OilBeaks I only heard about it last weekend, I'm afraid.
@ian_schow Hope to have a collection out this fall, including all the cosmere short pieces in one place, along with one new one.
@BucknerRyan I will most likely do so.
@lanceschaubert Elantris, Warbreaker, Mistborn, Stormlight, White Sand.  Plus the shorts, all of which will be in the collection.
@DarthBarthus Nothing good, I'm afraid.
If you didn't see, I did move Stormlight 3 up to 51% done. I'm simultaneously working on a Stormlight story this fall's Cosmere anthology.
@blooblee1 So less an allegory, and more a, "I've been thinking about war." The Plains take inspiration from many places, including Iraq.
@blooblee1 I don't write specific allegories into my fiction, usually, but almost everything I'm thinking about makes it in in one way.
@TheDScribbler Another used it when I hit in the #30s.  I think it's just up to you.
@TheDScribbler Bestseller list titles are strange things. One of my publishers refused to use my status until I broke top 10 on the NYT.
@TheDScribbler I don't know if there's a hardfast rule. I think a lot of people use it if it ever hits #1 in a category, even briefly.
@Aiglet Yes, I've been making too many assumptions.  We do need to be aware and publicizing this.
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford with him attitudes of the genre from back then. Hopefully, those nominating it didn't think I was lauding those
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford It stars a guy from a generic fantasy world being thrust into a new world...and he intentionally carries
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford (The new one, which Jason mentioned, that is.)
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford Thanks!  Though, with all this scrutiny, I'm kind of worried about the story.
@rachelswirsky "Applauding when my friends get caught in the collateral damage." Either way, the logical flow of the essay is off.
@rachelswirsky Yeah, I can guess why. And I suppose I should separate "Applauding in relief that Vox didn't control the awards" from
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford I do. Thank you for raising the issue. It has forced me to evaluate just what I was trying to say.
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford But it does remain that, slate wise, SP responded to criticism and did well, while RP doubled down on hate.
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford SP's refusal to denounce him was one my my biggest beefs with them, in communication with several high ups.
@jasonsanford @rachelswirsky The problem is driving Hugo nominees I know and respect from the room in shame, because they feel so vulnerable
@jasonsanford @rachelswirsky Applaud for his loss all day, and I'll join you with bells on.
@jasonsanford @rachelswirsky I'm going to assume that one is Vox, for whom I have 100% no sympathy or desire to listen.
@rachelswirsky Yeah, that logical flow wasn't the most solid. Even talking to you about it, I'm not sure my logical flow. (See last tweet.)
@rachelswirsky If who they chose actually won, we'd have an even bigger problem--as is, asking to be taken off their list seemed pointless.
@rachelswirsky As I consider, it's probably also because they lost so resoundingly. They can control the nominees, not the actual victories.
@rachelswirsky And I realized they're jerks, but I wasn't going to tell them they couldn't be fans. Instead, I'd tell them not to be jerks.
@rachelswirsky Yes.  Again, because of all this, I decided I wouldn't police who put me on their lists.
@rachelswirsky 2) Contemplating all this made me realize I shouldn't be in the business of policing who can and can't put my name on a list.
@rachelswirsky 1) Fandom reacted poorly, in my opinion, in voting No Award above deserving nominees, then applauding for their loss.
@rachelswirsky I do not take their side.  In my essay, I say I do not take their side. What I say is this:
@rachelswirsky Rachel, I condone nothing.  I'm saying that what was done hurt innocent people, and should not have been done.
@rachelswirsky I called them on it personally, in emails. Their bad behavior does not excuse our own.
@rachelswirsky Yes.  There are huge numbers of idiot loudmouths among their numbers, and they should be called on saying stupid things.
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford It turned the harassment of some loudmouths around, and in turn harassed people who had not done anything.
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford I thought that applauding when Toni Weisskopf and Anne Sowards lost was incredibly bad form, and made me sick.
@rachelswirsky @jasonsanford I read your tweets several times, and I'm not exactly sure what it is you're saying. Could you clarify for me?
My novella Perfect State has been nominated for a Hugo Award. Here are my thoughts on the process. https://t.co/CiDGM0DD7W
@nkjemisin I've started using Fifth Season in my lectures as THE gold standard for how to do second person. The whole book was brilliant.
@scalzi @nkjemisin Thanks, John.  My category looks awesome this year. A really good list of authors.  And novel..wow, some tough choices.
@nkjemisin Congrats.  That book is awesome, Nora.  Well deserved nomination.
Una revista de la edición 10º Aniversario de Elantris. https://t.co/PhzgixfF9Q
Last ATL airport stop: New York Times Bookstore, E gates, top of escalators. Little store, lots of Sanderson. :)
@Destrus76 Not necessarily. I think any order will give a unique view.  Pick the series that sounds most interesting.
More Atlanta airport signed books! Simply Books, center F Gates. The ever-friendly bookseller Michael will steer you well. SF/YA sections.
@ezdrodowski I'm afraid I have to let my wife handle things like this to keep my schedule straight. Drop an email through my website. :)
Atlanta airport! Find my signed books at Simply Books Gate B29, Young Adult section, next to Game of Thrones. (Yes, they have GoT in YA.)
LDS services in Atlanta were very nice.  Now back to JordanCon for a reading.
Just made a slight adjustment to the schedule for JordanCon and added a reading. See the full details here: https://t.co/IvWeLM3Aqo
@scottlynch78 Man, I thought that was the live count of people who had threatened to murder you for pushing back GB book four...  :)
@mpickeral Yup.
@TheBreeMae @samanthapfield Blanking on a book by a woman that is #2 in a series.  But Uprooted was in summer 2015, I believe.
@TheBreeMae @samanthapfield Number two of a series...  Uh...  I did suggest some #1s. Uprooted, An Ember in the Ashes, the Fifth Season.
@TribalInstincts We've talked about it.  It's on our radar, so to speak.
If you're flying through Atlanta, I managed to sign a few books at the Simply Books, center of the A gates. Look in the teen section.
@TheForlornOne Gate C7 bookstore.
@kuronime I will try to get some to give away.
@Kaladin6 I should get some to give away on Twitter and Facebook. :)
On my to Atlanta! Salt Lake airport Simply Books (gate C7) is well stocked with signed books. Prizes inside!
Atlanta! I’ll be at JordanCon this weekend with Catherine Asaro and John Picacio. Come hang with a friendly crowd! https://t.co/CFeqQPIBEN
@LochonR No, as I think I'd be a bad choice.  Though I respect George, my style doesn't match his very well.
@lurkatus So many cons, so little time.  :)  I'd love to go some day, but we'll see.
@HaydenCogswell I usually have time to sign a few books after every panel, so just ask.  If I'm free, I'm happy to do it.
@MatthewTwihard @david_reckoner @megan_tarash We shall see.  I'm not closed to the idea.
@CodyHar Um...it's pretty good?
@hugsxheart Thanks!
@CoachDacc Nothing good, I'm afraid.
New Writing Excuses + Update https://t.co/FnsWkTLQcN
@MentalMegalodon Yeah, the 50% means 200k done.  It might go over, but 400k is a fair estimate.
Oathbringer (Stormlight Archive 3) just hit 50% done on the rough draft, everyone.
Reader photos from recent conventions + Updates https://t.co/UjGE3j2BMo
Moved the Stormlight Archive bar up a percentage point, to 48%.  Inching closer to halfway done!
@BrianTMcClellan This is the result of repeated leaving sighed stock, and having it sell. There are stores in Atlanta with the same numbers.
@WishyWashy4 Ha.  Maybe some day.
Announcing the Mistborn: House War board game https://t.co/VgBCtTZUjF https://t.co/o4j3TkHeWa
@AKingdomofProse Secret history has some explanations...
Salt Lake airport Simply Books (gate C7) has about 100 signed Sanderson books W/prizes inside. (They like to be prepared for my visits.)
Wisconsin! This weekend I will infiltrate your local civilization in Madison, at Odyssey Con. https://t.co/eFmlIj1FM0
@jdetrapani Afraid not.  I almost always go through O'Hare.
Missed me at the Emirates Festival of Literature in Dubai? Watch one of my panels here: https://t.co/bw7GY1JOld
@Marnsicle A keeper for sure.
@MrDraeger My pleasure.  Thanks for reading.
@melaskia There's a running joke in the books that France isn't real.
My pitch for the Evil Librarians illustrated editions: https://t.co/E2WKOePFYb https://t.co/ylApDyIe1h
Just moved Stormlight book three (Oathbringer) up a percentage point to 45%. I'm back at work after long while on tour and doing revisions!
I'll be doing a few panels at FanX tomorrow in SLC, also the deadline for the Hugo nomination is approaching. https://t.co/v0BOIiSAZ0
@AlexClarkMcG The UK has a different art team, because the books are a different publisher.  That is what they feel UK audiences want. :)
@CurtMahoney Yup.  Should be a draft on the schedule.
The first part of the dramatized The Way of Kings is out. Plus I’m holding a falcon. https://t.co/KsX5aeV9qq
@rainer3 It's not something I've been clear enough about to publishers when they commission art.  My bad, not theirs.
@rainer3 Most of the Alethi are darker skinned, and would not look Caucasian to us. But most cover artists (and readers) miss this fact.
@bschneb It did while I was there, for sure.
@deeburg Ha!
@umutbesikci Afraid I didn't have a chance to find any.  But I did sign some in the Dubai mall.
@5aleesi Will do!
@Coritez @tor (We also sell signed book plates on my website for cheap, if you want an inexpensive option.)
@Coritez @tor You can email Store@brandonsanderson.com, and my assistant will tell you how to send us a book to be signed and returned. :)
@5aleesi Ah, yes.  Of course.  I wondered what happened to you regarding lunch!
@Dometellia Lol.  That hit me right in the childhood. :)
@5aleesi I didn't sign there, only went there for fun.  The signings were all in Dubai.
@BookBooksame Unlikely.  I should be finishing it in the next three or four months, but continuity edits on those books take a LONG time.
My trip to Dubai and Abu Dahbi was awesome...but WOW, jet lag.  Ten hours time difference is no joke.
SeaTac Airport!  There are four Stealth signed copies of Bands of Mourning in the Hudson News by gate c10. (Prizes inside.)
White Sand is previewed on io9! https://t.co/CO5rbzhyCE
At long last, the second printing of the leatherbound Elantris is now available my website store. See it here:  https://t.co/MobnbAJLpH
@SterlingHaws Ha!  That's on my spotify rotation.  I'm sure I listened to it wile writing the latest books.
@TownsonDuncan A lot have read them.  It's not lack of desire, but the fact that games like this cost so much, that is the problem.
@gregdobbs There are a lot of people I could imagine, but I think Simon Pegg would be an awesome choice.
@TownsonDuncan We've been trying to make one like this for years, but it has been a long road.
@Ahmedroid I'm sure I will be back.
@enxgmaaa Wow!
@ConorONeill19 June 2017.  Supanova. Sydney and Perth.
The Dubai mall has many signed Sanderson novels! Look at Book World.
@AymanTeaman @kellosam I'll tell them I have a friend coming, and they should let you in. If something goes wrong, send me a tweet.
@kellosam @AymanTeaman I could probably get you in, if you do end up coming. There are always empty seats, even when something sells out.
@Znb_z It's okay!  I hope you're enjoying the US.
@chaitanyamurali I have a vague desire to get there some day, but I'll probably need a convention or festival to invite me.
Dubai, I did not expect to arrive to a thunder storm.  But it sounds pretty cool from my hotel room.
Dubai! I'll be there this weekend at the Emirates Airlines Festival of Literature. Here is my schedule! https://t.co/G40sVBHijP
@Hossmobile @HudsonBooks At Hudson stores, I talk to the employees.
@MrsCruz1999 I signed at the PDX airport Powells last time I flew through, but that was months ago.
@Ste_Clarkson90 Just the UAE this time.
@randallwetzig Well, Hudson is a Bookseller, so...
@dumb_yeollie I plan to do so one of these years.
I passed through SeaTac airport on my way to Dubai. Find signed books at the @hudsonbooks by gate C2. Prizes inside!
Flying through Salt Lake Airport? I signed in TERMINAL ONE this time. Weller books just past security between A and B gates. Prizes inside!
@5aleesi :)
@dsharp524 Details should go up on my website later tonight!
@Ahmedroid sorry about that! Told my assistant, and he will get details up by Tues morning your time.
On my way to Dubai! See you all after a very, very long flight.
@Jonny__Nilsson Yes, but only after they've been out for a while.
@KarlSorrells @KyleLowther Afraid not.  Flew through Chicago instead of Detroit.
@KyleLowther I did just pass through...but LAX doesn't have easily-reachable bookstores from the place Delta flies to.  :(
@TokuDeka @SamSykesSwears You should see his middle earth fanart:  There's pages of it, and it's awesome: https://t.co/cgUInkXL4r
@FourofFiveWits I believe that @PeterAhlstrom knows this.  We worked it out for the new maps.
@CPAhopeful91 @booksamillion Happy to do it!  That looks like quite the haul.  :)
@VisaHQ Already exhausted those options, I'm afraid.
@VisaHQ They have all these protocols to keep us from speaking to a person at the actual office.  So we're very in the dark.
@VisaHQ I need someone who can actually talk to a person at the offices in DC, and get them to tell me the status of a passport.
Long shot, but does anyone have a contact at the Washington DC Passport office? Trying to get something fixed for an upcoming trip.
Introducing my next series, The Apocalypse Guard https://t.co/VfF1Napblo https://t.co/0hcyaP69fV
San Antonio airport simply books (by A terminal security) has many signed Sanderson books with prizes inside! Check the teen section.
Houston IAH!  Found one Bookstore (by the intersection to Gates c14-c23.) They have calamity in the front and steelheart in teen.
Chicago OHA! Find signed books with prizes inside at all three Barbara's Books!  Gates E3, B10, and between the H/K gates!
Chicago OHA airport! The Barbara's Bookstore between the H&amp;K terminals has many, many signed books with prizes!
Philly airport Heritage books (in the mall on the way to the C gates) has signed Bands of Mourning!
Today’s the last day to get the #Steelheart ebook for $1.99! #TheReckoners https://t.co/Pi3jDPfpJX
@Stormgate50 The shards were first.  The metals are in a way a...further division on an established pattern.
@reedobar I apologize. I have to fly out tomorrow.
@Descender421 I want to go some year, but can't make it this one.
Philly! I am on my way. The good folks at Children's Book World have relaxed their ticket policy, and are super nice. Hope to see you there!
@Perraup I believe it will.
Denver airport! Find signed books of mine at the tattered cover bookstores in the C and B terminals! (B has more.)
@polynikesATF Afraid not.  Airport stores often lag a week on releases like this.
@marcusjaeg Nice!
@jme198 the end is just out now!
SeaTac airport Hudson Books by gate a9(ish) has signed Bands, Hero of Ages, and Alcatraz!  With prizes inside!
If you haven’t started reading the #Reckoners series, grab the ebook of #Steelheart for $1.99 and start today! https://t.co/Pi3jDPfpJX
@AndrewF_Writer :)  I'll hopefully get around to explaining that some day...
Flying through Salt Lake City? Tony at Simply Books (gate c6) has you covered! Calamity and Bands, prizes inside! https://t.co/3N4iYaZcMf
For those of you who got #EpicBookstore swag for #Calamity, the Dropcards site listed on the punch-out cards is working now.
#Calamity, the final installment in #TheReckoners series is out! Follow #EpicBookstore for where you can get signed copies with epic swag!
Portland OR: signed copies of #Calamity with Epic swag are also available at #EpicBookstore @Powells. https://t.co/KeErYk00L4
Live in or near Bellingham, WA? #Calamity signed copies and Epic swag are available at  #EpicBookstore @auntiesbooks https://t.co/wrJSGPC1fn
#Calamity is out today! I’m signing tonight in Orem and around the country for the next two weeks. Details:  https://t.co/K0Sj4CvVmM
Okay, all.  I have to get back to signing your books in preparation for the release of Calamity!  Thanks for your questions.
@nookBN It was fun!  Thanks for having me in!  Now, back to signing books for the Calamity release! #nooktalks
@Scotaidh82 You'll have to read and find out!  :)  #nooktalks
@Hordfest That will be up to him, and his schedule.  We will always ask!  #nooktalks
@4jlessad @nookBN It does happen, and I'm always flattered when it does! #nooktalks
@MaryBrittenham @nookBN :)  Eat a Runza and some Colby Ridge popcorn for me!
@nookBN A tie between winning a Hugo award and releasing the last Wheel of Time book, so far.  Excellent question! #nooktalks
@StevieFinegan @MrVicBam Depends on the series.  I'd like to see Mistborn and the Reckoners as film, Stormlight and Wax and Wayne as TV.
@NongNingNang I liked Leviathan Wakes, which I read recently.  #nooktalks
@NongNingNang I real maybe a book a month.  Much less than some people, but I have to fight to make time! #nooktalks
@nookBN @bluejaybooks Revision is the most difficult, by a long shot.  #nooktalks
@dcafwriting RAFO. #nooktalks
@MonsterMetroid Some day, I'm sure I'll do a Lurcher character. #nooktalks
@Silasary @nookBN Summer 2017 Supanova! #nooktalks
@AsianWill1991 This is an excellent question!  :)  (And one I'm not going to answer yet, I'm afraid.)  #nooktalks
@4jlessad @nookBN @randallwetzig The best film versions of books make changes to fit the media. So I plan on this happening here. #nooktalks
@Hordfest I think Tad is an excellent writer, and have loved much of what he's written. I'd happily call him an influence. #nooktalks
@nookBN @TM0NEY46 Yes, I have--but it's almost always a side character, more a cameo than anything else.  #nooktalks
@Mikemclendon @nookBN I will have another Reckoners-like series that we will announce very soon. #nooktalks
@jdlerud I think it's a cool category; I'm just not convinced that the public is embracing it.
@StevieFinegan I could see myself doing pretty much anything, within certain bounds of harsher content.  #nooktalks
@MrVicBam If, by this, you mean film adaptations--we're trying very hard.  Unfortunately, it's up to Hollywood more than it is me.#nooktalks
@nookBN @randallwetzig They will be relatively close, time wise.  Across twenty years or so, rather than hundreds.  #nooktalks
@mooglefrooglian Hemalurgy is built to be able to be used by anyone.  It's about taking and breaking. Ruin doesn't care who does such things
@Aucraptor No, not so far. #nooktalks

@nookBN @AlexandraFL21 It ended up working very well, so I'm quite glad that I did so.  #nooktalks
@nookBN @AlexandraFL21 They made me accelerate some cosmere and Scadrial events forward to that era. #nooktalks
@Phantrosity No, not without additional help.
@fabfandragon Nothing  more than I've said, that it's looking really good, and we're expecting a summer 2016 release. #nooktalks
@NathanDallon @nookBN I wrote thirteen before I sold one. I was pretty bad at this when I started... #nooktalks
@Ellionious :)
@Hordfest I write every day.  My motivation is the same now as it always was: to tell stories.  Not much has changed.  :) #nooktalks
@nookBN @randallwetzig It depends.  Publication order is just fine.  However, I often start people with Mistborn. #nooktalks
@Ellionious Being a man, Kaladin would avoid writing anything, as it wouldn't be proper.  :)  #nooktalks
@loganaube I'll be doing a 1980's level tech, and a future tech, in upcoming series.  So you could say that there are.  :) #nooktalks
@Phantrosity Yes, AoL is after Stormlight 5.  Specific timing will depend on how long I make the 5/6 gap once I get there. #nooktalks
@MentalMegalodon 50/50 chance.  Haven't 100% decided.  I'm often slow on Worldcon decisions.  I am at DragonCon though.
@nookBN Ideally, we just get a casting director who is really good at this, and then after that, I can't imagine anyone different.#nooktalks
@nookBN This is a hard one, as I don't generally "cast" my characters with real life actors in my head.  #nooktalks
@kidsmomo Though I loved them both, I didn't really see them as different (in genre) from other books. I truly discovered sf/f as a teen.
@kidsmomo No, though one of the earliest was Dragonsblood by Jane Yolen.  I also read the Hobbit pretty early.
@Phantrosity Anything that gets you a glimpse of the Spiritual Realm could help with placing spikes. #NOOKTalks
@nookBN @Apollo_lll Hm... I mean, Steelheart is invulnerable, can fly, and can shoot lasers out of his fists.  It is hard to go wrong there.
@MentalMegalodon Afraid that, when on tour, I just don't have time for things like this.  You have to catch me at a convention. #NOOKTalks
@nookBN Then I build a series around the ideas and themes that worked in the first book.  #NOOKTalks
@nookBN This is very common for me in a series.  Writing the first book, making sure I have the characters and ideas down first.  #NOOKTalks
@nookBN I had the ending of the first book well in mind.  Once I finished it, I sat down and plotted the next two books.  #NOOKTalks
@jdlerud I'm reserving judgement.  If the readership likes it, then it will take off.  If not, oh well. #NOOKTalks
@ArgentSun This is frequently the case, but it's not 100%. #NOOKTalks
@HidaOWin RAFO!  #NOOKTalks
@YataVSTheWorld Yes, this would work. #NOOKTalks
I'll be doing a twitter chat with @nookBN for a #NOOKtalk for the next half hour or so!  Follow along with the hash tag.

Here are the cities on my #Calamity tour, starting February 16th! Plus some updates. https://t.co/52kl2tHLT5
@TheForlornOne ...I read and give feedback on.  It's an evening class, so you don't have to apply to the full BYU experience to take it.
@TheForlornOne If you're close, next year, you might want to just apply to the workshop part of the class. That's 15 students whose writing
@TheForlornOne You can certainly do that--though that will only be the lecture (which will be helpful to you.)
Thanks to @audible_com for setting this up, and for the awesome job they've done with my books. (Particularly the Reckoners series.)
I'm afraid I've got to stop now with the chat!  I'm so sorry if I didn't get to your question.  There were a TON!  #SandersonChat
@walkerstalkerSC @audible_com Yup.  He's been in all three of them so far!  (Very small parts in Alloy and Shadows) #SandersonChat
@phasmantistes RAFO!
@TheClumsyman Yup, that's it!
@david_reckoner @megan_tarash I'll be releasing a little instructional manual on this in a few weeks called Calamity. :)
@odbjorg_qiulin Yes.
@BallFromGrace Afraid I don't have time to do this. The only feedback on writing I can give is to students at workshops. #SandersonChat
@Greg2Lazy Not in anything large scale. #SandersonChat
@CVFreeman Kaladin took some research into field medicine and depression.  He probably took the most. #SandersonChat
@dcafwriting I'm not sure if you're thinking this, but Nazh and Hoid are separate people.  #SandersonChat
@AStirlingMacD No.  Instead, it follows quantum multiverse theory. #SandersonChat
@JOrtiz45 If you're only in the city, then Temple Square is very pretty and worth seeing.
@JOrtiz45 Zions national park and Arches are both excellent. The Shakespeare Festival in Cedar City is also quite good.
@Hexy27Bernie1 @fabfandragon Yes, it should be getting one. #SandersonChat
@mandallaguitar @audible_com I'm planning it to be Eshonai. #SandersonChat
@mandallaguitar Depends on the situation and the Radiant order.  #SandersonChat
@Capturesreality Next year sometime.  #SandersonChat
@fabfandragon RAFO
@shyninglightart My State of the Sanderson 2015 has the most relevant information on this I can give.  Give that a look.  #SandersonChat
@sleeplessxdream @audible_com I don't believe I will be.  (Dragon Con instead this time.) But I've decided last minute to go before.
@AStirlingMacD RAFO.  (Sorry. I am toying with a book on Threnody, and don't want to lock myself into anything yet.) #SandersonChat
@CaitShanly My own life!  :) #SandersonChat
@Sagar_m10 Almost always.  I'm a planner.  Once in a while, I do a short story where I don't.  Even that is rare, though. #SandersonChat
@shyninglightart Windrunning, probably.
@tnyo I wanted a form of siege warfare that was different from anything that readers had seen before, but had the same despair to it.
@ericth2 @TheEnglishPhan RAFO.
@rainapayne1 They don't need to hide in particular in Elendel. #SandersonChat
@Volratho It IS possible to spike someone without killing them.  But they'd never be the same.  It would be worse than being a drab.
@AStirlingMacD No.  More a rhythm of book releases, and making sure Stormlight books are more regular. #SandersonChat
@mikezentz Well, I'm looking forward to seeing you in Seattle!
@U2kingdom I have watched some Doctor Who and liked it a lot--but I don't do screenplays, so I might not be a good choice. #SandersonChat
@12thrdko Real people.  #SandersonChat
@YataVSTheWorld Ah, that's an excellent guess.  But no, that isn't the case.  It's more about Connection.  #SandersonChat
@Un0ri Yes, you can use the name now.  And yes, I plan a sequence of these.  #SandersonChat
@hylian_gamer Stormlight 3 is first, then the final Wax and Wayne.  #SandersonChat
@msashwill Lots of things. Isaac Asimov connecting his Robot books and Foundation books was a partial inspiration to be certain.
@slate06november In the end, though, I realized that I just really loved doing this--and would keep at it even if I never sold.
@slate06november Closest I've come was about two years before I got published. I'd been rejected so much, and had worked for 8 years.
@diatesseron I don't think I'd be a good choice for those books. Let's just hope that George can finish his own series properly.
@333_jen I don't think so.
@AStirlingMacD The Parshendi aren't the radicals, though.  In that conflict, I'd argue that the humans are.
@Chaos_Geek The final Mistborn sequence will have him as a main character, as will the Dragonsteel prequel novels. #SandersonChat
@TheForlornOne Those are the only two regular ones--but I do others when invited.
@TheForlornOne My university class is another, though that only happens locally. And if you watch my schedule, sometimes I do others.
@TheForlornOne Writing Excuses cruise is one, though I'm only one of 8 or so authors on that one, and so you aren't guaranteed to get me.
@12thrdko A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge, or some good historicals, like something from Bernard Cornwell.
@kthumes16 Not yet, but it will come out before too much longer.  #SandersonChat
@dcafwriting Yes, if they are popular enough, I do. #SandersonChat
@NGriener Offhand, I think that would be theoretically possible, though in practicality impossible. We'd need @PeterAhlstrom to do some math
@TheEnglishPhan We've sold Steelheart to Fox, Emperor's Soul to DMG, and Mistborn to the people who are working on the video game.
@cvdks I'm RAFOing most questions about Identity right now.  (Sorry.) #SandersonChat
@Stircey No.  My favorite tends to be whatever I decide to work on next, which changes.  #SandersonChat
@PontHall RAFO!  :) #SandersonChat
@david_reckoner @megan_tarash Ask me this again after you've read Calamity, and I might have more info I can give.  #SandersonChat
@AStirlingMacD Factory is one that doesn't exist in our world, but I believe I have it in Chattanooga. #SandersonChat
@MissHybridVigor @audible_com @ThePlatypuses My pleasure!  #SandersonChat
@blindbraille Once I hit that point, my chances improved.  Elantris was rejected half a dozen times over four years before selling.
@blindbraille It took me ten years of work to become an author who wrote books that were of professional quality. (more) #SandersonChat
@ZanderHatch It would take a Looooooot of power.  (A near impossible amount.) #SandersonChat
@jhnvnvgt Nothing big.  Steelheart has a script.  It's the only one so far to hit that stage.  #SandersonChat
@CptFabulous Last I heard, they had a script they liked, and were sending it out for a polish. I will be as involved as they will allow!
@Zmann966 Honestly, it's whatever dynamite comics decides it is. If it's up on Amazon, that's a good guess--but not 100% confirmed.
@fabfandragon Maybe (and it's a BIG maybe) next year when worldcon is in Europe. #SandersonChat
@333_jen Yes, I plan to do more.  Look at the State of the Sanderson 2015 blog post for more details.  #SandersonChat
@dcafwriting Depends on which book you're referencing.  By the W&amp;W era, they've known each other for a long, loooong time. #SandersonChat
@gamblersruin Wayne.  #SandersonChat
@mandallaguitar @audible_com I didn't want Alcatraz to have to follow Cosmere continuity and rules. Yes, the magic could work in the cosmere
@MistbornWolf This is a question for @IzykStewart.  But I do think he plans to do more as we progress.  #SandersonChat
@Numuhukumakiaki Yes, this will be answered eventually.  #SandersonChat
@asdobkin Only Wayne and Hoid are likely to cheat, and they'd be in cahoots. #SandersonChat
@fabfandragon The Cosmere short fiction collection, which we hope to release in the fall, should have one.  #SandersonChat
@SmackeetheFrog Gloryspren because he pretty much always feels like he's done something awesome.  :)  #SandersonChat
@Clowdx81 Atium has some screwy things going on.  It's not one of the 16, but not just anybody could use it. #SandersonChat
@mandallaguitar @audible_com I will try my best!  #SandersonChat
@BHasenlechner Hmm....  Probably one of the Alcatraz books.  #SandersonChat
@jusme_thatsfine And some do swap, particularly for given books.  But neither is the other in embryo. #SandersonChat
@jusme_thatsfine I think that both pantsers and planners generally learn to use the tools of the others side on occasion.  #SandersonChat
@siribron @audible_com The musical?  Haven't seen it, though I hear it's good. #SandersonChat
@AnnaTheEvilGeek Almost always after the book is done, with notes before certain chapters of what to include above that one. #SandersonChat
@angievcrafts My pleasure!  Thanks for reading.  #SandersonChat
@mikezentz Really, it started with the hats and went crazy from there.  #SandersonChat
@CptFabulous About a year after Stormlight 3 comes out, I'd guess. #SandersonChat
@YataVSTheWorld It is his birth name, if that's what you're asking. #SandersonChat
@n0robin Cadsuane from the WoT was the one that comes to mind. #SandersonChat
@TwainHouse @audible_com Ha.  Well, I traveled 105 days on tour last year, and my wife is adamant we do less. So convince her. :)
@DeathIsSilver @PeterAhlstrom or @IzykStewart Can give you a specific on that, if you need one.  I don't have the scale map handy.
@DeathIsSilver No.  You'll have to wait for the stories to get those. #SandersonChat
@TheForlornOne I have done this before--but always in conjunction with a writing workshop.  Never from someone over email or the like.
@TheEnglishPhan Sometime next year.  (See my State of the Sanderson 2015 blog post for details.) #SandersonChat
@geeohteee I think I might be visiting next year sometime.  I believe I said yes to a con there.  Can't remember rexactly.  #SandersonChat
@dilillicious Yes, I was.  As was my editor.  We both agreed it was the right ending, though, and so I didn't have to do much convincing.
@chrisWhite Highly unlikely, probably impossible--but impossibility is hard to judge.  #SandersonChat
@thomasandbooks @audible_com I'd probably want @BrianTMcClellan or @BrentWeeks, though I don't know if either would have the time.
@dcafwriting No, I'm afraid.  I've got WAY too much longer to be writing this all to give that away now.  #SandersonChat
@herowithamnesia Sometime in 98-99.   #SandersonChat
@sarahceliann Only tackle a few elements at a time. #SandersonChat
@sarahceliann Once you have the big things fixed, you can move on to smaller issues.  Be goal based in your revisions.  #SandersonChat
@sarahceliann Organize your list of changes by importance, and try fixing only the most important ones in your next draft.  #SandersonChat
@Zmann966 It glows because of the power seeking to come through it, not because of the power within it.  #SandersonChat
@Zmann966 Metal is a key, not the source of power itself.  Most is not specially invested.  #SandersonChat
@mk919973 Some day, we will probably do this.  But I want more of the different worlds fleshed out first.  #SandersonChat
@jhnvnvgt Yes, I will.  The final mistborn books will have this.  There's already some in novellas like Secret History and Sixth of the Dusk
@dcafwriting Another RAFO.  (Sorry.)  #SandersonChat
@fabfandragon That is a RAFO, I'm afraid!  #SandersonChat
@EvilNuff Not terribly good at the moment.  :) #SandersonChat
@ajrula Most likely, it returns to the Spiritual Realm, where all places are one, and where you were is irrelevant. #SandersonChat
@Greg2Lazy We just did!  I think we posted them yesterday.  Look on the "upcoming events" tab of my website. #SandersonChat
@elektrotal @audible_com But after events of AMoL, you can assume he dropped in to check on them.  #SandersonChat
@elektrotal @audible_com RJ's notes had them going on separate paths, specifically because he wanted Mat to go to Seanchan. #SandersonChat
@TwainHouse @audible_com I would like to visit; I hear you do good events.  You have to convince my publishers to send me on tour.
@SquillWill Almost nobody has ever seen Night's Sorrow. #SandersonChat
@SquillWill Not a priority at all, considering their situation.  Neither really gave it much thought.  #SandersonChat
@alexperc92 Honestly, it was zombie stories.  I wondered what it would actually feel like.  #SandersonChat
@yurisses He did jump to some conclusions.  Whether he's right or not will have to wait for future books.  #SandersonChat
@everi_j Sazed.  I think he could teach me a thing or two.  #SandersonChat
@SquillWill Yes.  And RAFO.  :) #SandersonChat
@WinesprngBrothr Yes.
@drcandland So his place in the third book changed, and after finishing it, I planned out what he did next in my notes. #SandersonChat
@drcandland Spook was the big surprise in the series. Everything else was planned from the get go, but I grew to like him a great deal.
I'm doing a twitter chat w/@audible_com for the next hour! Use #sandersonchat to ask me things. Follow along by watching my @ replies.
The #Calamity tour starts February 16th! Check here to see if I'm coming to your city: https://t.co/zqJB4HLZKQ
Want to read a deleted scene from #Steelheart and get some cool #Reckoners swag? Enter the #EpicSandersonFan sweepstakes!
@jasonpaas One could make that argument.
@p_forget Secret History will help with that.
Salt Lake airport gate C7 simply books is well stocked w/Sanderson books once again! No BANDS, but everything else. https://t.co/VtV4JZBaI0
I want to see your #ReckonersSeries photos! If you don't know about the #EpicSandersonFan sweepstakes, look here: https://t.co/sY0yHfaUxP
@EmilieKearney I'm sorry.  He just didn't feel about her the way she did about him. (Plus, her path leads other directions.)
There is still time to enter the #EpicSandersonFan sweepstakes. Details: https://t.co/dvPBOpjDvR want to see your #ReckonersSeries Photos!
@BrandSanderson Here is a working link: https://t.co/sY0yHfaUxP
#Steelheart is on sale for Kindle for $1.99 for the next two weeks. https://t.co/TrXWsmr4Av
@G_Unit_Pears Stormlight will continue to have them.  I haven't decided for other books.
@N_Bhattacharyya Advantageous in pushing against someone else, trying to knock them over. Disadvantageous when lifting yourself into the air
@samnoble The Mistborn books in particular will slowly skew more and more Cosmere-oriented over time.
I have a new post up about #Mistborn releases, plus my award-eligible works from 2015. https://t.co/XqRa5bF7lx
Hugo nominations are open. You can nominate if by January 31 you're a member of the 2016 or 2017 Worldcon. (Or 2015) https://t.co/xb2SXGxiYM
Some of my readers brought in this awesome license plate to my launch party for #Mistborn The Bands of Mourning. https://t.co/PfKvpzANJS
Until January 31st, @kobo is selling my novellas at 50% off (in many countries) if you use the coupon code JAN1650 https://t.co/gRb7mM6IGk
#Mistborn The Bands of Mourning is the #1 top seller on @GooglePlay Books: https://t.co/xRmFKL4hA1 — Thanks everyone!
@MollyMintonx The goal is Christmas time.
@MollyMintonx We hope to do Mistborn.
@MentalMegalodon @cobraspideyguy Should be very soon.  We're booking the last ones now.
@KeeganLaycock @robertjbennett Yeah, I've been meaning to read it forever.  I'm not a few chapters deep and enjoying it.
@TheAOster We're publishing a collection of all the cosmere short pieces in the fall.  If you can wait that long, you can get this in print.
@KeeganLaycock @robertjbennett Curiously, I'm reading City of Stairs right now, after my assistants insisted I finally get to it.
@FtKulpa It's been a long time in the works, that one.  Glad to finally release it.
@o_edisa :)
@MentalMegalodon @cobraspideyguy ...that I didn't sign them until Sat. I know they shipped them ASAP, but we usually ship them a week early.
@MentalMegalodon @cobraspideyguy The problem was the quick turn-around time on the book.  Tor publishing to soon after the others (more)
@cobraspideyguy :(
@chobindue I...I can't remember if I signed some of those or not.  It was all a blur during the holidays...
@LyndzCambridge :)  Sorry for the bad metaphors... (Actually, no, I'm not.)
@VickiGooderson My pleasure!
A quick shout of thanks to Stacy Shabalin, Andrew Eisenman, &amp; Adrian Liang at @amazonbooks. Secret History is live because of their help!
The Bands of Mourning is out today in the UK, Ireland, Australia, new Zealand, South Africa, etc! https://t.co/lvYzyRab9l
My novella Mistborn: Secret History has gone live on Kindle: https://t.co/rY5foayjb9 . Links to other versions here: https://t.co/aLkzLFdtfg
@Eifeirobin @WstonesLeeds I believe they do have some, if they didn't already mention it to you!
@JosephADevlin Wow.  Pretty cool!
@JamesSc67472390 @Waterstones Several have been tweeting that they have them.  I don't know what % got them, though. So maybe call ahead.
@DarkDesperado25 @SandersonArmy @elektrotal It's about a black-aligned planeswalker loafer who summons demons to be his butler &amp; house staff
For those in the UK, remember that many @Waterstones stores have signed copies of the Bands of Mourning on their shelves!
@sarahmccalip @murderbooks Sweet!  I think I might be back there on the Calamity tour (not 100% certain).  Maybe I can sign it for you then.
@FtKulpa Oh, the flashbacks!  Also, "I've been locked out of my room."
And if you don't know how to sign up for my newsletter, it's easy to do here: https://t.co/xrKJmCmRjL
@Tru_Breezy My pleasure.  Thanks for reading!
@EndiWebb That couldn't hurt.  I've followed you.  Could you direct message me your email, and I'll drop you a line?
@edasque In the fall, when we release a collection of cosmere short fiction, you'll get an audiobook for them all.
@Ghostwolf_Fangz It will go up on my website soon, and we'll tweet it.
My January newsletter has gone out to all subscribers. If you signed up but don't receive it, try whitelisting my domain name.
@townk @Kijof_san Thanks anyway!
@SamSykesSwears @BrianTMcClellan @amazon Your ear is in the mail, Sam.
@Jackangelinegem The problem is, we wanted it delivered yesterday.
@BrianTMcClellan Shakes fist at James Patterson and J.K. Rowling.
@elektrotal I actually have one that I've been kicking around for a while...
@Perenniality314 @amazon She's a very popular teen vampire romance author.
@Montzerin There will be a collection of Cosmere short fiction in the fall.  That will contain it.
@RepairmanJacked @amazonbooks You shouldn't read it unless you've read at least the original Mistborn books. Maybe up to BANDS.
@RepairmanJacked @amazonbooks Title is listed in the back of Bands of Mourning.
I mean, not to brag (much), but I'm currently @amazon's #5 bestselling author. That should count for something, eh? https://t.co/xc6HJeGPFq
@Ryanlmn There will be one in conjunction with the collection of all cosmere short fiction, coming out in the fall.
@Un0ri The book's postscript should mention it.  It has small spoilers for Bands of Mourning.  It's a Mistborn ebook novella.
The Secret Project should be out on @amazonbooks, yet is still listed as a preorder. If anyone has a contact there, I'd love to talk to them
.@iBooks asked me for some book recommendations. You can see them all here: https://t.co/AAu12Nadqx
The newest Mistborn book, The Bands of Mourning (came out yesterday!), is the #1 book on Audible right now. https://t.co/5s402y9CeZ
@TadeuAratel My pleasure.
@SazedHeroOfAges :)  Nice twitter handle, by the way.
@Rushlimbang I have news that people at Amazon are looking into the problem, and are trying to fix it.
@NetworkIroning Fox is progressing nicely with the film rights, but there's nothing to report yet other than that.
@digitalbias The 30th is an error--we're working on Amazon to get it out earlier.
@thomniscient89 The idea is to do leatherbound editions of my books on or around their 10th anniversaries.  So it will be a while.
@Omaewamo For Christmastime this year we should have a collection of all cosmere short fiction in print.
@jamierobinwu @devbryce A few days early is one thing; a month early is another. I'm quite surprised.  Either way, though, enjoy the book!
@jamierobinwu @devbryce That's interesting.  I didn't even think they were shipping for a few weeks yet.
Also, the excellent @kobo books (which are always so easy to work with) have the secret project up for sale as well.
@NetworkIroning If we did it, it would be years in the future, I'm afraid.  So while it's possible, it will take a while.
For those hunting the secret project mentioned in The Bands of Mourning postscript, @iBooks has it up before most of their competitors.
@KathleenDorsey6 @TheDanWells https://t.co/EflQuFOEc8
@JoshLCantrell As soon as Amazon decides to release it.  :(
Mistborn at release party for The Bands of Mourning. https://t.co/NAWbPcGNac
The launch party for #Mistborn The Bands of Mourning is tonight! Only a few hours away. https://t.co/MdtYqxRbYz
UK fans, check your Waterstones. https://t.co/jR7K8pJQpw
@ChelsElizab Unfortunatley, I've never read or watched one.  :(  I was born a little too early.
Signing copies of the new Mistborn for you all. Lots of doodles of Wayne doing stupid things... https://t.co/3OIJvRND8h
@Tarbal81 Thanks!
#Mistborn The Bands of Mourning signed/numbered copies can still be ordered from @WellerBookWorks here: https://t.co/ZVzRKJdZYV
Preordering #Mistborn The Bands of Mourning for the BYU Store midnight release is now by phone only: 801-422-2400. Too late to order online.
@bentkraus @PeterAhlstrom Usually, I'll only personalize about three each time through the line.
@bentkraus @PeterAhlstrom Depends.  If you don't want personalizations or quotes in them, just a signature, then any number is fine.
@mwbryant22 Um...it was supposed to go down, but I don't sign them until Saturday, so if you slip one in it probably won't be a problem.
@chickinwhite English language only, I'm afraid.  :(
@supersteve524 :)
@ClaraBrioo My pleasure!
My literary agent, Joshua Bilmes, is temporarily open for submissions for the first time in over a year. See here: https://t.co/Gx8stLQkBR
@ef8ffa1e1d63446 This piece of fanart is closer to what I imagine, but I like seeing all different interpretations. https://t.co/vpEaYUffXQ
@GGSavin We posted a few pages of them in the State of the Sanderson post in December, and gave an update there.
Have you ever wondered what Kredik Shaw would look like in the Minecraft world? Wonder no more... Thanks lynchying! https://t.co/67hrvPkoy4
Today is your last chance to order from Weller Books to get your signed and numbered copy of The Bands of Mourning: https://t.co/ZVzRKJdZYV
@seyEliveD It will make sense when it happens.
@BrockVanKomen (Fist bump.)  We've all been there, man.
@ermbern But man, that turned really unhealthy really quickly. Let go, man. It's not worth it.
@ermbern Friend, contrary to what you might think, I really have no problem if you hate my books. Everybody has different taste. It's cool.
@SamSykesSwears Genius.
@BrockVanKomen :(  I doubt you'd want to go through what he had to...
@daimonionen That is odd.  It shows up on each device I look at it on. ??
@Darren_Doll @PeterAhlstrom Also, we might be able to dig one out of our boxes for you.  I don't know if we have any author copies left.
@Darren_Doll Hmm.  Maybe @PeterAhlstrom can ask the publisher for you.
@Bukealicious @ChrisWarcraft If he wants to, we will certainly accept his help.
@Un0ri @RosaWatkinson In general, the US likes covers that are more illustrative and the UK likes covers that are more symbolic.
@Un0ri @RosaWatkinson It's based on the art director at the two publishers, and what they think markets best to their audience.
@ChrisWarcraft Heh.  Most of mine are like you mention.  Stormlight just needs some extra care to keep focused.
@DouceBleedsBlue Malazan is good (but admittedly hard to get into.) I also liked Naomi Novik's new book, and @BrianTMcClellan's series.
@blerms Yeah, but they also made me a mod so I could approve things after the bot takes them down.  :)
@uta_shirokage And if you want something more expansive, you can try Stormlight Archive.  Thanks for reading!
@uta_shirokage The Reckoners is my series that's most like Mistborn, but it's more straightforward. Elantris and Warbreaker are stand alones
@uta_shirokage You have lots of options!  Alloy of Law is the same world many years later, &amp; starts a new series (with some familiar cameos)
I promised a longer update on how Stormlight 3 is going, so I posted it here: https://t.co/9oVWummo67
There are plenty of signed &amp; numbered copies of The Bands of Mourning available for preorder from Weller, here: https://t.co/xdzFGPSKjz
@gman0184 Yup.  Just send an email through my website form and request a copy.
@anghopeswann Wow!  Hope you enjoy it!  :)
@itsdehprey I don't mind that price for a new Stormlight book, but I think it's excessive for shorter books. Sorry. We'll keep complaining.
@itsdehprey That said, I do think that they charge too much for my ebooks, and it's a constant complaint we have at them.
@itsdehprey The mass market (listed at $8.99) isn't out for another year, so that's the disconnect.  The ebook will drop to match it.
@epictreasure1 No, but I am coming to Supanova 2017 I believe. Not sure which cities.
@CurtisPoier We usually don't sell the hardcovers until a year after a book is out.
@MGE9119 Stormlight.
@Darren_Doll And since I don't read Chinese very well myself, I have no idea which sites would have it.  :(
@Darren_Doll I'm afraid that the only way is to get it is probably going to be from a Chinese language store.
@Darren_Doll Yes.  There's both a simplified version and a complex version.
@Castlebro Thanks!
@ermbern Nah.  It just takes a lot of pages to describe your mother's incredible girth.
@thegentleman4 400, actually, at the font of Shadows of Self.  But they'll use a smaller one for this book.
@weeks_conor I'm afraid the release date depends on things like artwork and editing, which is really hard to guestimate.
@Shonn71 Probably Oathbringer.
With today's chapter, I polish off Part One of Stormlight 3. There should be five parts, though this one will be the longest.
The final preview chapter for Mistborn: The Bands of Mourning. Book is out next week! (Spoilers for Shadows of Self) https://t.co/I5sr1P2gtI
@russellmbrown They are owned by the company who has the Video game rights
@G_Unit_Pears Malazan has great worldbuilding.  Promise of blood and Black Prism are both books that fans of mine often like
@G_Unit_Pears Malazan has great worldbuilding.  Promise of blood and Black Prism are both books that fans of mine often like.
@russellmbrown They are owned by the company who has the Video game rights.
@x0artliveart0x It is a great song.
@TejFeiFei My pleasure.  Thanks for reading.
@focoma They are invested. (Magical.)
@hoIyoak He is not, but he has (unknowingly) spent time around people who are. A little has rubbed off.
@gregoryrichards They are printing more, and say they should arrive late Feb or early March.
@kotmjaksel1 @Korolevamara19 @BradleyJames Wow.  That's great.
@SchofieldDrew Hmm.  Might be a book club edition.
Sorry everyone, with the link for the digital line sign-up was broken. This is the correct link, and it's open now. https://t.co/mZPXzOhMlo
Details are all set for the midnight release party for The Bands of Mourning, the newest Mistborn book! https://t.co/MeszKbtjQ1
@Igantinos That's a good suggestion.  I'll remember that one.
@mossy_toes Yeah, I think that's a valid way to take this too.
@Igantinos As I understand, it is only ban worthy if you ask people to upvote it. People link their AMAs all the time.
@JadePhoenix13 Very interesting.  I'll have to look at that.
@dexter_neal64 I actually have story ideas for MTG fanfics in the back of my head.  But I doubt I have time to write them.
@kevinyoufool Yes.
@Ka0sneph Problem is, I like to play in person, as it gets me out of the house.
Some Magic the Gathering thoughts I posted on reddit (in my usual unabbreviated style) for those who are interested: https://t.co/gbnJ548Q3k
The Bands of Mourning signed &amp; numbered from @WellerBookWorks—explantion here: https://t.co/UKJsStDoME Order here: https://t.co/xdzFGPSKjz
@OasisDreamer Goatee.
Writing Excuses has a new focus for 2016, and the instructors for the 2016 retreat have been announced: https://t.co/CGHbqrnBzO
@dandersontyler My pleasure.  We should have a new series of those up by the summer.  This time, with better sound recording.  :)
@DarkKnightOtep Should be soon.
@KrimnoxAxshi Midnight. Byu bookstore. (I think.) We will post details.
@Jerra157 RAFO. :)
@AndrewKropff It is a thing in my head I can't describe.
@XackHackMan Yes.
I'm hearing that my books are 2-for-1 today on Audible. If you're a member, see if you can find the deal. Check your email.
Ch. 5 of new Mistborn book The Bands of Mourning is up! https://t.co/vQ6UlPYlrU Comes out in all formats Jan. 26. Shadows of Self Spoilers!
@ThatJoshJerez I have actually submitted to them before.  Always been rejected.  It has been a few years now. Doesn't seem our tastes align.
@EatonMardi Whom did you buy it from? From us directly?  Either way, I can get you a replacement. Email me at store@brandonsanderson.com
@karsyutain I would love there to be more.  Tell your Korean friends about Emperor's Soul. The better it sells, the better our chances.
@michaelhguy Um, well, *I* certainly approve of that choice.
@playfullrachel Not any time soon.  (Sorry.)
@Mathieubutt Heightenings would still recognize them as being alive, as their flesh is alive--even if they're pasting it over dead bones.
@BrianTMcClellan Heh.  You could probably give all my speeches as well as I could.
We just added the numbers, and I was on tour or at conventions 105 days last year.  That's...way too much.
@Plansaresatan I just start signing.  These are leftovers from last time, though.
@MightythorJRS @torbooks Huzzah!  I love how the broadsheets turned out.
If you got a B&amp;N gift card for Christmas, Orem store still has a nice stack of signed Sanderson Hardcovers. https://t.co/Ja8Wn6HNvi
@AF_Library Wow, really?  I had no idea I was even in the running.
@SFReviewsnet @torbooks We had a whole lot of fun putting those together.
@FaffyFagus No answers for you yet.  Read on in the series, and perhaps you will find some.  :)
@TrnkaRobert Hard to say.  It goes back decades.  I can't remember if the music was a thing by the time I was developing them or not.
@n0robin Not sure I'm widely known enough for that.  But if they asked, I'd say yes.
My good friend (and Nebula winner) @EricJamesStone has a book release at 7:00 PM at the Orem B&amp;N. It's a great book! https://t.co/1bFlUDiUZ5
The Battle of the Tower from the Way of Kings, in gingerbread form. Amazing, timmysaurusrex and sister! https://t.co/FQtKR7HBfT
@yurisses @PeterAhlstrom It has to do with their entire distribution chain.  I'm afraid that's why it's showing up for you on that date.
@yurisses @PeterAhlstrom The UK (which controls English rights outside of the US) releases new books on Thursdays, instead of Tuesdays.
@TheGreatWilson Awesome!  Keep writing.
@Mael_sp Small chance, but yes.  I'm planning to visit Italy, and then hit a few cities in Europe, in the fall.
Check out this nifty custom bookshelf that /u/clyguy (on reddit) built to hold my books:  https://t.co/iwz4dkczbv
The Bands of Mourning comes out Jan 26 in all formats. You can read chapter 4 (spoilers for Shadows of Self!) here: https://t.co/JyuSmDlJ2N
@Kookie_the_Bard Afraid not.  I was there in October.
@sirgourls Not all humans originated on Yolen, but the first humans were there. Watch the books for myths that hint at more.
@EAKM I will take that position with pride. :)
@scifan3 You jumped into the deep end first. :)
@TrnkaRobert I support that!
Thursday is the final day to get the Writing Excuses anthology Shadows Beneath in a bundle of 25 writing tools books https://t.co/V7RMBzHsip
@Donaithnen Yes, Harriet had that printed in the books.
@Tiger_Hebert Dalinar.  Shallan and Kaladin are finished in this section.  When this is done, part one will be finished.
@MorpheusStone I think one more is coming up.
@dasdydixx I've toyed with doing something about her.  We shall see.  It's not outside the realm of possibility.
Writing Stormlight 3 in a recliner, feet up toward the fireplace. Sure beats the days when I wrote the first at a hotel front desk overnight
The Elantris leatherbound first printing is sold out, but more will come later. And you can preorder Calamity audio. https://t.co/F9CBVntILK
@amanharan @Kerrydan It was an honor.
@mindofmetals I was going to joke that I hoped you guys got a fresh sheet of drop bears instead.
Merry Christmas, all. May God bless you &amp; yours. Hope you all got as much snow as we did. (And if so, hope you don't have to leave today...)
@playfullrachel Congrats!  Sorry for the terrible handwriting.
@BrentWeeks Yeah.  I think To Green Angel Tower by Tad Williams was around that length.  It can happen, but might not be the best idea.
Need a last minute holiday gift in Utah? Orem Barnes &amp; Noble has a nice endcap of signed books, including hardcovers https://t.co/qSrOYc5nqV
@actually_Jay No.  It is not spelled that way in Alethi, unfortunately.  It is a cool side effect in English, though.
@GrantMHansen @PeterAhlstrom That's great!  Very nicely done.
I really need to stop adding extra chapters to this book, otherwise it will end up being twice as long as WORDS OF RADIANCE...  #Stormlight3
The next Mistborn book, The Bands of Mourning, comes out in January! Tor .com has chapter 3 up now: https://t.co/7EpDnN8GZs
I’ve put up my annual State of the Sanderson—my year in review and status on future projects. https://t.co/623jZNQXAd
@funkyemmitt Maybe some day, but for now, I'm very pleased with this as the canonical version.
@Lord_Veins It was a difficult ending to plan and write, but the right ending all the same.  :(
@coady2788 Thanks!
@Tatlovesbooks My pleasure. :)
@Amagan930 Huh.  Where are you getting them? You should be able to get a replacement for free.
My annual "State of the Sanderson" run-down of projects I'm working on should go up tomorrow. First look at the White Sand graphic novel!
@JamesF46 I think all the sales were on books this year. (The beanies cost us a lot more to make than the books.)
@MelodiousMiguel @bryanmisch It has been SLOOOOW going on the video game. Not much to report, I'm afraid. :(
@nyctef Answers to these questions are coming.
@alejogo_787 There are plans to do more.
@LeslitGS It's based on a projected length near the other two. It's not an absolute hard number, just a guess.
@up2000lbs I liked Uprooted from @naominovik, the latest from @BrianTMcClellan, and am re-reading The Lions of Al Rassan by @guygavrielkay.
Moving Stormlight 3's percentage bar (on my website) from 34% to 36%.  Slow, but steady, work the last few weeks.
@SamSykesSwears I don't think taking more risks would hold them back, but I can understand the fear.  Books have less of an excuse.
@SamSykesSwears I was told that Bethesda doesn't expect Fallout 4 to be profitable until about the four year mark.
@SamSykesSwears I think there is this perceived fear that the unfamiliar will be alienating to some. AAA games have such a high failure rate
@SamSykesSwears I think we've all had this rant at some point, Sam.  Games seem to be extra conservative on this; annoys me sometimes too.
@weirdralph @ocremix He goes by @BigGiantCircles, though I'm seeing that he deleted his twitter.  (So I don't know what's up there.)
Added a song to my Stormlight 3 writing soundtrack, one by Jimmy Hinson, one of my favorite @ocremix artists.https://t.co/vdzUPMmuFQ
Prints of the art that inspired the seons in Elantris are 25% off! Free shipping for Whelan newsletter subscribers. https://t.co/f9TIBlajEA
@dotdrew I often consider using something in-world, but you have to be careful about how much jargon you use. It can be off-putting.
@dotdrew For instance, using the name of a city in the Roughs where people are thought to be like that.
@dotdrew Usually, you should assume if we didn't translate it directly, it's something that wouldn't work too well in English.
@dotdrew All cosmere books are to be read as if translated to our language.  The translation often uses our idioms to convey ideas.
@smallmighty22 There are more coming. But I think BYU bookstore has a couple left. https://t.co/q1PC83e0j6
@Brad0478 Probably not.  You can ask at the store by gate C7, but they are likely sold out.
Stay tuned for more bookstores that will have signed #Calamity copies when you preorder! I'll share each #EpicBookstore's announcement.
Chapter 2 of Mistborn: The Bands of Mourning is up on Tor .com! Comes out in January. (Spoilers for Shadows of Self) https://t.co/UE27mka8sa
@DrCankerz @PeterAhlstrom I believe that's what we'll do.  Info probably won't come until first week of January.
@ef8ffa1e1d63446 @Dsc_01 @PeterAhlstrom I am planning to include some discussion of this.
@Peter_Keep Thanks!
@Dsc_01 @PeterAhlstrom We have permission to post some for my State of the Sanderson blog post, coming late this week or early next week.
@ef8ffa1e1d63446 I suppose I could post some.  I'll consider it in January.  December is going to be erratic.
(Looks out at aftermath of last night's snowfall.)  You know, seems like a good opportunity to stay inside all day and write books.
Get special Epic swag (and signed books) by preordering #Calamity at an #EpicBookstore. So far all Hastings stores are in—more to come!
@Jasondcall There have been a few, but I don't mind hearing more. :)
@gasty "Spren" is a term for things on Roshar.  So yes, there are a few, but they're from Roshar originally.
@TamilInPajamas Not yet.  Maybe some day.  This is a different project.
@OliverKennett Not a specific one.  Or, rather, many--but nothing I can point exactly toward.
Tonight's interesting email exchange: the finer distinctions between KPOW, BLAM, KRAK, &amp; KABAM for gun sound effects in a graphic novel. :)
@PlaysWithFood I just looked and it seems your email got cut off halfway through. :(
@sleeplessxdream Wow.  Nice!
@Greg2Lazy Shoot me an email through my website if the reviews on audible don't say. I remember my team complaining about something.
@Greg2Lazy I think it has most, but @PeterAhlstrom was saying that it might be missing a bonus item or two.
@sarahmccalip Hope you enjoy it!
@Pablo16xd We will keep it in stock for a year at least.
@TheMichiMouse Read the @PatrickRothfuss novella or picture books.  Both are great.
@alejogo_787 Afraid not.
@Morrigan_83 Thanks!
@KurtAAnderson Hmmm...  Drop us an email closer to Christmas and ask how close we are to selling out. Right now, we still have half left.
Elantris Leatherbound (Official) https://t.co/5fnzbAZs4e
Read the first preview of The Bands of Mourning here: https://t.co/ewyIvJdpcn Comes out in January.
@MariekeMills :)
@thistakesawhile Thanks for the kind words.
@jdyk1030 Entirely possible it's been sold.  I signed in a lot of other bookstores, but I hear they are mostly gone.
@jdyk1030  It was about a month ago for me. I did sign some books. A gate Simply Books. Check the copy of Name of the Wind there.
@SubtleChronicle Ask them to order another to replace yours.  If they can't, I might be able to get you one--but it could take me a while.
@YevP After Well is Hero of Ages.  That is the last of the original trilogy. Alloy starts a new one.
@TouchingVirus Not sure.  Usually they do paper simultaneously or very soo. Maybe ask the publisher? They may have decided to wait.
@brockmdean Ha! Well, I'm a trumpeter, so not far off.
@SubtleChronicle Werever you got it should be willing to exchange. I'm not sure of the hardcover cover status. Email me if you have trouble.
National Novel Writing Month Recap https://t.co/dmoAS3ySoa
@klenems I should be there most years, but I was JUST there last month.  So probably not until next fall.
@kansasdad Wow!  They still had one?  That's lucky.
@akhil_rhurac I plan to make it there some day.  (To India.  Maybe not your house.)
@kyliamiskell Very nice!  Thanks.
@mauricio19222 Many.  Try my podcast, Writing Excuses. https://t.co/TK7RQBVXnI
@elektrotal @lsv Sorry, Shivam.
@violagoyf @lsv :)  And I did finally get some signatures done.
Looking for a quick holiday gift in Utah? I just signed a bunch of books at King's English bookshop (both adult @ teen.) Prizes in a couple!
I'm doing an AMA on /r/Fantasy on reddit. It's a group AMA, in support of Wourldbuilders, so we'd prefer broad, general-interest questions.
@moniaka6 @PaulOrku I will ask about this. @PeterAhlstrom, will you remind me?
@boyd2671 I use laptops.  So whatever it comes with. :)
@_glennafish The list is at the bottom of the blog post. Front page of my website.
@compli_cate I think that is @EricJamesStone.
@codybye I think that, as ebooks become more of a deal, high quality specials are going to come more to the forefront for collectors.
@feistykitty They ordered a stack of them to split among the locations.  If you call Peter Hoingstock at Beaverton, he might have more info.
@PaulOrku Polish rights were sold to MAG.  I'm pretty sure they did an edition. Is it out of print?
@KiraAMcFadden @PeterAhlstrom Could answer this.  I don't know the printer off-hand.
@Enchantedbooks  But all numbers ordered before January will be numbered. (Maybe 1000 numbers total.) @MystGalaxyBooks will have low numbers
@Enchantedbooks @MystGalaxyBooks We plan to keep them in stock for a year or so, at the very least. So no set print run.
@vecna Maybe next time I visit, I can get the publisher over there to do a printing of these themselves, and we can sell them then.
@vecna Wish I could.  :(  We just charge what the companies charge us.  There's no handling fee.
@5aleesi His little brother, who did it quite intentionally for reasons we haven't been able to figure out.
@convictdave The UK is planning something like it, but I don't know when.  I do ship these to the UK from my website.
Elantris Leatherbound full color maps! Get it at my store or retailers like @MystGalaxyBooks https://t.co/dtMAkfs6B3 https://t.co/y0a8FdFX88
@ArgentSun The Aonic Alphabet is not something I ever designed, I'm afraid.  This was before I had Isaac.
@ArgentSun Aon Ene is something I can conceivably do, but it won't look as good as in the books.  (My drawing skills are bad.)
@ArgentSun They would write the ENE as a single Aon, and the Ev in their equivalent of hangul, where each letter is a single sound.
Monday, we made family rules. 5-yr-old solemnly added: Don't cook pets (Has never happened) &amp; Don't poop on the floor on purpose. (This has)
@davedelong If this one sells well, we will do that for certain.
@bhobbes :)
@ArgentSun I can totally do that.  EnE is an Aon.  (Sarene's Aon, of wit.) You'd probably just be Evene.
@Flyplu Not in leatherbound, I'm afraid.  But there is a Spanish edition of the original.
@murderbooks Wait until you see the inside!
Elantris Leatherbound is here! I'm signing/numbering them now. Numbers 1-50 are going to stores like @murderbooks https://t.co/5Cw2OQlbQm
Missed it yesterday? If you're overseas and want the Elantris leatherbound, order now. https://t.co/dtMAkfs6B3
@AlexRahlUA Yup.
@Aheffy Betsy Mitchell is said to be fantastic. Is freelance now, but was editor of Del Rey for years. I haven't worked with her personally.
@thewayofkhriss My UK publisher is planning a cool edition like this sometime in the next few years.
@Aheffy Depends on your budget. A freelance editor will be worth the money, but not all new authors can afford one.
@Justin_T_Call No specific date planned.
@Justin_T_Call It's slotted right now for once I finish the fourth (and final) Wax and Wayne book.
Okay! Finally ready to take orders (particularly for people overseas) for the Elantris Leatherbound Edition! https://t.co/dtMAkfs6B3
@searle_pat Yes, my store ships worldwide.  But again, shipping is expensive. It's almost as much as the books themselves.  :(
@searle_pat Deadlines for getting them to the UK by Christmas will be tight. Blog should go up in the morning UK time.
@searle_pat They will ship worldwide, though be aware, the shipping is expensive overseas.
@Thelonicon My yearly "State of the Sanderson" post will talk about that.  (The news is all good regarding White Sand.)
Good news! The shipping company (which had lost the Elantris leatherbound crates) has finally located our books! Blog post soon.
The Rithmatist ebook sale + Updates https://t.co/XjKKjPVozW
And don't forget The Alloy of Law ebook is at $2.99 for the rest of the year. https://t.co/bbo5g7aw8R
One-day sale! The Rithmatist ebook (in the US) is only $2.99 today on most platforms, and $1.99 on Nook. Links here: https://t.co/uRiMAlfHRE
@darci_cole Close, but with breathing room.  Just hit my 50k.
And I've finished #NaNoWriMo2015. 50,031 words on Stormlight 3 this month--with an entire hour to spare, even. :)
@LKHamilton @AuthorUniverse Thanks, Laurell!
@jasonkryska It's one of the few series out there with the quality and scope to match WoT.
Kids are in bed; here we go into the final push. 1103 words in the next two hours and twenty minutes to hit the goal. #NaNoWriMo
@jasonkryska It is coming along nicely, but it's still a ways off.  Have you tried the Malazan books?  Or @naominovik's books?
@j_papshmere16 @djf137 Most spren are neither.  Sapient spren (capable of making choices) can be either one.
@MORIDIN881031 Switching series is how I actually produce quality.  If I stuck to one, I'd get in a rut writing it.
@brandonword This is to hit the goal for #NaNoWriMo, a kind of writer's challenge done in November.
Okay! Taking a break to do Family Home Evening (a Mormon thing) with my kids. 2903 words so far, with 1103 left to hit the #NaNoWriMo goal.
@CouponFriendly Awesome!  Thanks for giving them a try.  Let your husband know I appreciate him advocating for me.
1672 words so far today.  2379 left. #NaNoWriMo (I'm working on Stormlight 3 Interludes right now.)
@Sprackle Every book I do is going to have a slightly different tone. Mistborn goes more epic in later books, though.
@greenerz514 Writing it right now.  Plan to finish next spring sometime, with a release sometime thereafter.
@greenerz514 And a third in January!
I encountered this dichotomy frequently in my university writing courses when I was a student: https://t.co/CME9m9fjPR
@djf137 Ulim. (Also, the Unmade count as spren.  You could look those up.)
@Sanalith Yeah, problem is that the shipping company has lost (yes LOST) the books.  So we're still waiting to see when they'll get here.
@djf137 Well, do you need good spren? Or is the occasional evil spren acceptable?
@hermitdruid Afraid that the shipping service LOST the books.  We're still trying to get them to hunt the things down. :(
@bigdanc I am a stick!
@keeyjay_ When it's done and revised, yes.  That won't be for a while yet, I'm afraid.  :(
Okay, here we go.  Last day of #NaNoWriMo2015.  I have 4006 words left to write before midnight.  Doable, certainly.  But it might be tight.
@mistborn_avatar @PeterAhlstrom All they told me is "We have plans."  Nothing specific.
My store has the hardcover double of Perfect State/Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell. I will personalize. https://t.co/MFEoCJF7GJ
I have now posted annotations for 17 chapters of The Alloy of Law. You can read them here (read the book first!): https://t.co/01O9gLef2F
@AnemoneTea These are fantastic.
For those who couldn't make it tonight, I left a bunch of signed copies at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Idaho Falls. https://t.co/hG6PIMlVpw
Saw this during my signing at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Idaho Falls. You're welcome. https://t.co/q2KU5KtBry
To all my readers in or near Idaho Falls,  I am signing right now at the Barnes &amp; Noble at the Grand Teton Mall! https://t.co/RaTKsmzHqO
@iBambam2981 Not much of one, but a film might happen.
2k words today. Only 2 days (not counting Sunday) to get 6k more before month's end.  Doable, but tomorrow's signing will slow me #NaNoWriMo
@DeadAsHellHP Most do not.  (Hope you enjoy the book!)
@BurnsCorp Ha.  Which outfit is that? Is it from the DLC?
@e_chemyst We usually use tin as the official symbol, just because we like how it looks.
@tpdudley Just finished a book, and been thinking of re-reading the Lions of Al-Rassan, a favorite of mine.
@AvanPoker This is great information. @PeterAhlstrom, will you note these names for us to use in talking to publishers in Brazil?
@AvanPoker If there is a publisher or translator you particularly like, that will be very useful information for us going forward.
@AvanPoker There's an email form on my website.  Stormlight will depend on the Mistborn books doing well, publishers have expressed interest
@AvanPoker Even better is if you could suggest some fantasy books that were translated well, so we could try to get that translator.
@AvanPoker I'll look into the translator.  It would help if you sent us an email explaining what you didn't like about the translation.
@AvanPoker Both are very close to happening.  My visit won't be next year, but should happen before too long.
Idaho Falls! I am signing Saturday at 4:00. Details here: https://t.co/lI4wjoITEJ
@Al_Farseer Yeah.  :( We don't add a surcharge. That's just what the postal service charges us.
@futuredreams35 Thanks!
@RoostieJDio I'll pass that on to Kara (my store manager) and our T-Shirt guy (who is local.)  They try very hard.
My store has cool stuff like T-shirts, Mistborn jewelry, signed books including Stormlight and Legion hardcovers. https://t.co/DK1cue8afg
Steelheart is being featured on Audible's Treat Yourself Black Friday Sale for only $4.95. You can find it here: https://t.co/wIk4RueHxz
1,300 words today. (It's a holiday in the states. Only managed to get to work after everyone else went to bed.) Roughly 8k to go #NaNoWriMo
@melissa2ann Afraid I didn't pass through there.
@Aarmora Idaho Falls B&amp;N on Saturday at 2.
@iBambam2981 I'm not touring for it, unfortunately, since I'll be touring in Feb for Calamity. No news yet on those dates, I'm afraid.
@BradInUtah Yeah, we left early for that very reason.
Drove to Idaho for the holiday (and to do my signing in on Saturday) and managed to write 600 words or so after getting in. #Stormlight
@KimNorris37 They do get kind of long...
The Alloy of Law ebook at $2.99! https://t.co/bbo5g7aw8R
@MrVicBam Between 6 and 18 months after I finish the manuscript, as determined by my editors.
@dominique___h Koloss who breed end up with someone "koloss blooded" like you've seen. They have to accept the spikes to be come full koloss
@Andrew__1701 Yes, it should be on my store very soon.  (Maybe by the end of the week.)
Today's Stormlight 3 wordcount: 2566. Still working on Part One, which has three viewpoint characters. (You can probably guess who they are)
@jmarshallmorgan Nice!
@BrandonTDaniel If you wait until January, you can read it, then go right into the sequel.
2282 words on Stormlight 3 today.  That leaves just shy of 16k left to do before the end of the month, to hit the #nanowrimo goal of 50k.
@Whipreck Thanks!
Liked Mistborn trilogy? The ebook for the sequel, The Alloy of Law, is on sale (US) for $2.99 the rest of the year. https://t.co/W1DRuxGzJb
Goodreads Choice Awards Voting Ends Tonight + Updates https://t.co/o9FuM1ktLw
@darci_cole Just over 1000.  But family obligations ate the whole day save for these last two hours.
1044 words in the short writing time I was able to squeeze in.  I'm pleased, though I have lots to do next week to hit my goal. Good night!
@VictoriaLOsborn That's pretty fast.  I usually hit around 500.
@AdinaNorth Nice!
@ClarElizabeth4 :)
@dperabeles Hmmm.  I'll ask my shipping manager and see what is up.  Drop me an email through my website, and I'll update you that way.
@jbutikofer Keep it up!
@TheTreavor Ahead of me.  Nice!
@SarahTwinkie That's always best.
@Chiriplock Looking forward to you being able to read it!  Someday, I really want to visit Chile some day. Hopefully we can meet then.
@kirylin Nice!
@darci_cole Yes, for another hour or so.
@dperabeles Does the store on my website (https://t.co/xcoRdjCbkI) not ship to Mexico?  I thought that it did.
@Justin_T_Call Yeah, I can imagine the work that would take.
@howard_corey First is reasonable; second, a little tough.  :)
@sneaky_monkee A worthy goal.
@Hexy27Bernie1 :)  Take a shot every time you read someone cocking their eyebrow in a book.
@KaciHill The last few days were bad for me, so you might have passed me up.  I'm at 31k.
@Bethanyrambles For ones this complex, I write a character sequence, relying on an outline to keep viewpoints in sync.
@lord_tolkien Just over 30k.  If I want to hit 50, I'll need to buckle down next week.
@irothtin That's fine.  I've always though that choosing a manageable goal and shooting for that is the best way to go.
@SarahTwinkie You could always have ninjas attack. :)
@raven_oak @davidfarland I didn't dare get that yet.  I'll wait until this book is done in the spring.  :)
Time to do a little late night writing on Stormlight 3.  Anyone out there working on their #NaNoWriMo project tonight?
Tor is giving away (US/CA) 15 copies of the new edition of Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians on Goodreads. https://t.co/ZkN2G3If1m
@rmehlinger You'll have to read into the future and see.
@mikezentz Thanks!
Phone calls with agents and publicists prevented actual wordcount yesterday.  But today, I passed 30k words for the month on Stormlight 3.
@HinaQui @ShitePost The origins of Shardplate has not yet been revealed, though some things are easy to infer.
@LostCadence Hmm...  Maybe music that fits the mood of the stories they write.  (Or something like a music subscription service gift card.)
The Waygate Foundation is doing a charity drive and you get to help choose where the money goes. Check it out here: https://t.co/DmYj1GKYVx
@juicysingh @PeterAhlstrom LAX is tough--they just don't have good bookstores, and the airport layout is very divided.
Working on publicity and marketing details for Calamity's release, instead of writing, today. Maybe will have some time later.
The Signed Page is giving away an ARC of The Bands of Mourning. https://t.co/so2TccbUc7
@fbstj We will post shipping deadlines for the holidays once we have the books in hand for sure. I hope there will be time.
@mistborn_avatar You will have to see. :)
Worked a Stormlight 3 "Story within a story" today. (Like the Wandersail or Fleet.) Called, for now, "The Girl who Stole God's Light."
@ryanszrama  ATL has those two WoT books only.  (And a Pat Rothfuss book I signed.)  Both in the A Gates Simply books.
@ryanszrama ORD had some in October. Probably gone by now, but you could have them call around to all the stores.
@CassJayTuck @kimnorwood146 Third (and last) one in February!
@Zmann966 We'll give you plenty of warning. I should post about them on Monday, and plan to open sales end of the week, if possible.
@AStirlingMacD We've also inserted full-color versions of my favorite covers from around the world. We're very pleased with it.
@AStirlingMacD Yes they will be!
@_readerz I plan to post them on Monday.
@ken_hainsworth I will post them early next week, once we get the books in.
@kimnorwood146 You'll have to wait and see.
@williambneal I don't know if I'll number or not; all copies will be signed. Weller should have some, as well as @MystGalaxyBooks and others
@kimnorwood146 Calamity in February is the end of the series.  More may be done in the world in the future.
@G_Unit_Pears Yes, I will be.
Waiting for the Elantris Leatherbound edition? (Details:https://t.co/zxZJ9ZJSaN) Should be in by Dec 1st at my store and select booksellers.
@kocherb Depends on if you count all the planning time.  I started the first exploratory scenes for this one in summer 2014.
@JubileeHillFarm Ha!  Cool.  Was the Rothfuss book gone?
@michaelhguy @Eadams51 Hulkbuster is a bit larger than most Plate, but in your version of the story, you can imagine it however you want.
@kimnorwood146 I haven't, though I've considered buying the new one.
@ShitePost It can't be a spoiler, as the fan simply drew what they imagined. They have no more information than anyone else.
@decio_val Got it.  We'll see what we can do.
Check out this awesome fanart someone gave me of Jasnah (in Shardplate) while I was on my #shadowsofself tour. https://t.co/VUMTkIWTsH
@Radda_in_motion Mostly official.
@BritneyMMills I enjoy things like this, but you usually have to catch me at a convention or book tour. That's when I have publicity time.
@mizzelle Well, both of the recent Mistborn novels were 100-120k words, &amp; the Reckoners books are closer to 90. So not everything is huge.
2667 #NaNoWriMo words on Oathbringer (Stormlight 3) yesterday. Book is at around 114k words total. (Finished book should be around 400k.)
@kimnorwood146 I have enjoyed the ones I played.  But I haven't played many.
At Forbidden Planet in London, I saw these awesome nails based on the UK Mistborn covers. https://t.co/l32PWhG1x6
@Lock_is_Light My whole life--work, social media, etc--is spent alone on a computer.  I like Magic because it makes me be social.
@Lock_is_Light Thing is, I use Magic as something to do with people. I don't need another thing to do alone on the computer. :)
@mattdoveywriter @WritingExcuses Then I shall take you up on that!  I'm sure even if I don't make it, we'll cross paths eventually.
@iBambam2981 It is possible.
@mattdoveywriter I haven't decided yet.  I really want to go, but I think I might be too busy at that time.
@Lock_is_Light Afraid not.
@iBambam2981 SoS is more about the characters, less about the cosmere. (Though there is a tad.)  Bands is more cosmere relevant.
@dan__sloan @longshotauthor No prob!  It's a good book.  I wouldn't mind losing to Jim.
Goodreads Choice Awards final round voting! Nominated are Shadows of Self: https://t.co/AVvPc9Mj90 and Firefight: https://t.co/UrJSaxgJkt
Writing during the con was tough, but I got 2,300 words during the flights yesterday. Bringing me to around 24,000 #NaNoWriMo words so far.
@GlassJMPrison87 Usually Mistborn or Reckoners.  You jumped into the deep end first!
@tqy_tqg_tql Bands of Mourning has a few more than you've seen recently.
We got home, and the wife said, "Now we have to be responsible, parental adults again." Then she proceeded to jump up and down on our bed.
@wildstorm95 Man, those went fast. Good to know.
@Maven @DavidTChristian Pat has a different writing method.  He is very open with fans, but can't pin himself down on things as well.
@MallencetheLock I have been invited and am trying to find the right time to get out to Argentina.
I have confirmed that ATL B C and A gates bookstores are sold out. (A gates have 2 WoT books.) E gates NYT store probably still has a few.
ATL airport is almost out of my books since last week's signing blitz. At A gates Simply Books, I signed a @PatrickRothfuss book instead.
@zacharybruno Yes, it is.
@SamJHock Thank you from me as well! (He says gushingly.)
@DavidTChristian I'm approaching the end of Part One. (Of five, though the fifth one is often short, and I already have the flashbacks done)
@tommartell Many congrats, Tom. Well done.
@TEdunWrites Atlanta airport! Nice.
@ecalvert67 Sweet!
@smidgetron It is indeed on the schedule tentatively as a project for next year, after Stormlight 3 is a wrap.
For those following along, my wordcount for Wed on Stormlight 3 was 2289, and yesterday was 1837. None today, as I was at the festival.
@hlwrites0490 @naominovik's new book, Uprooted, is great--as is her other work.  @BrentWeeks is excellent, as is @BrianTMcClellan.
@angryangry_man If you don't get a band, grab me after one of my events, and I'll sign for you then.
@bnofreeride Usually, my publisher is the one who handles tours, in conjunction with bookstores.
Charleston, if you missed my signing today, I have another one Saturday. My YALLFest events are free if not sold out https://t.co/1273HNN0AS
I'm in Charleston for #yallfest2015! In case you missed the posts yesterday, I left many signed books in the Salt Lake and Atlanta airports!
@HardbodySlender :)  Human the koloss is very happy you found him.
@timothystarner Mistborn would be the easiest. Emperor's Soul has been a challenge for us, and would be more interesting to try.
@melrailey @SpellKatie I'll be there soon!
I discovered what pattern looked like as an infant at the Kepler's Books in Menlo Park during my #shadowsofself tour https://t.co/JDXlA1qauG
The guy sitting by us on the plane was randomly reading the same book as my wife. @curtisjobling @ben_aaronovitch https://t.co/VSB0hbPMDa
@BeskarTom Signed them all!
@GabeRegier Not so far!
@ScubaSteve1219 Sorry. Didn't see this until I was on my plane. :(
@Thelonicon This is my favorite of the broadsheets so far. It was Ben's (the illustrator) idea.
As usual, the New York Times bookstore (E Gates) has the most of my books in the Atlanta airport. It is tiny, but loves my books.
ATL F Gates Simply Books has a completely different selection of signed books. Say hi to Michael for me if you go. https://t.co/WpsfgC8PdP
Atlanta Airport! Signed copies of Steelheart and Mistborn at the Simply Books, middle of the A gates.
@LynezR I will ask my assistant. I think we were just going to use them as giveaways. Maybe we will put them on the store.
@letzgoterps afraid not. :(
For those wondering, the prizes I left at Simply Books (gate C7, SLC airport) are Stormlight lanyards. They only have 4. Ask Tony for one.
@pharbero Nah. They all know me by sight now.
@av8trwife I'm glad that people are starting to like Steris. She's a favorite of mine.
Huge stack of signed Sanderson books @ SLC airport Simply Books (Gate C7). Talk to Tony or a salesperson for a prize https://t.co/vPNub1yKJH
"How's this for a cover for Stormlight 3? You can follow my NaNoWriMo progress here: https://t.co/vHvQ01h8O8 https://t.co/3tKjM53K2l
@grahamiao We can't really say until revision and art are done. I've been saying fall next year, but that's probably optimistic. 2017 likely
@Aucraptor Vielen Dank!
Stopping at 2629 total words today after tonight's session.  Stormlight 3 is still coming along nicely.
@icblues There will be a sequel eventually.
@mabchris1000 I'm afraid that can't happen, as per Robert Jordan's wishes before he passed away.
@Yourigath I didn't choose songs on the playlist for their lyrics or meaning, for the most part.
Added a new song to the Stormlight 3 Writing playlist. One from the Beyond Earth soundtrack, suggested by a fan. https://t.co/vdzUPMmuFQ
@law_theawesome Say thanks to your brother for me, then. :)
@Shane_Oneal I shoot for 2k-3k a day, and can do that pretty consistently.  Sometimes, more time does not equal more words, though.
@RoyHartford Yes.  It's my only writing project, save some revisions on a short story, until it is done sometime next spring/summer.
@VictoriaLOsborn I rarely do NaNo "officially."  I just post my wordcounts to, hopefully, give other writers a boost and some moral support.
1960 words on Stormlight 3 today.  Will probably do another session later tonight.
@TyMoseley If you don't get a wristband but are at the convention, just grab me in the hallway or before/after an event &amp; I'll sign for you.
You can vote in Goodreads Choice Awards. Shadows of Self is a semifinalist https://t.co/J24UNAOceq as is Firefight https://t.co/KvnkZrRYKU
@rmehlinger How could would it be if you could turn them inside out to make a mistwraith, then back around to be a pup again? :)
@FableReader Thanks!
@G_Unit_Pears) That kind of ignores the two years of outlining and half a year of revision these books take...
Stormlight 3 words done today: 3834. Higher than usual, as I got some done last night after midnight rolled around, and stuck that on here.
In the UK, I was on the excellent, and hilarious, Tea and Jeopardy podcast by @EmApocalyptic. Here's a video: https://t.co/XuPSvzgg9F
@NSallakAnderson @MayaLMWhite It was a hard ending to write, even if it was the right one.
@SierraLCook That's good.  Don't try for 400k books at the start. The first few I tried crashed and burned. Practice on something managable.
@emanwelsch Both Way of Kings and Words of Radiance were 400k. One of the reasons that Stormlight books take so long...
An insightful, and heart-wrenching, post from @MaryRobinette. https://t.co/GksAQ52Bme
@jonficke Yes, matching the other two.
@jarxg We're starting to pick up in Mexico, so I really should do a signing next time I visit.  I need to do some more Aztec research.
@kalebscholes :) Defend your circle!
Back working on Stormlight 3.  Got about 1,300 words earlier today.  Should hit 25% (100,000 words) on the book sometime today.
@authorjasonlink By removing distractions, and creating something fresh, we can look at problems from a new angle.
@authorjasonlink Fantasy books are about the real world, seen through a different lens.
@KristaMarino @randomhousekids Nice! Really excited about this release!
@gastonmooney Not immediately, but I have some ideas.
@nookBN :) Love my Nook. Thanks for the promo.
@MayaLMWhite We have thought about using swirling mists and making metal glow blue.
@TEdunWrites I will be back through this weekend, I think.  So you barely missed me.
@mitchwelham I believe the printer just shipped them, so a few more weeks.
All right! Signing off for the Sabbath. 1160 words on Stormlight 3 today; 12,057 for the week. Will get back to it Monday. Sleep well, all.
@BookBuddyLin Bands of Mourning should soften the blow. That's one of the reasons to release it so soon.
@mikezentz National Novel Writing Month. I'm posting my wordcounts for those participating.   https://t.co/QLaLMqFZ5G
@wes_chu Well, good luck to you, then!  I often have trouble writing when drowsy, so hopefully you're not too tired.
@BookBuddyLin Sorry.  :(
@Ehvayne I need to find the quintessential "stick" song and put it in there, eh?
@PandaChristophe Give him my thanks!  Enjoy the books.
Doing some late-night #NaNoWriMo writing after a busy day full of playing Terraria and play dough with my boys.  (And play dough Terraria.)
@kevhughes34 Most are around 100k words. Stormlight books are 400k.
1536 words on Stormlight 3 today.  Will probably try to do another session later tonight.  For now, this will do.  #NaNoWriMo2015
@_LisaRodgers Fantástico!
@morabit0m I enjoy @audiomachine's work.  Will probably add more of their tracks to the playlist eventually.
@dragonglave It's been a while.  I remember liking a lot of them, but really being satisfied by pounding on things with the hammer.
@AxiesWR It's not terrible, but it needs a very solid trim--maybe 30%--and the characters aren't as deep as I'd want these days.
@dragonglave Not specifically, though I thought it was an excellent game with an equally excellent soundtrack.
@LostCadence https://t.co/L9TzZeRLj9 https://t.co/5vuh5Yc4ZY
@LostCadence Interestingly, one of the apostles' brothers is gay, and comes to church with his husband sometimes.
@baldwinamandac @Spotify I have listened to my share of power metal, but it can be distracting while writing. Better for planning sessions.
@zacharybruno Listening right now.  Thanks!
@Enchantedbooks @Spotify Yes, this exact list of songs right now.
@townk Ah, so that was you!  Well, you're welcome. :)
Let's try this out. I've been listening to music while writing Stormlight 3, so I built you a @spotify playlist: https://t.co/vdzUPMmuFQ
@up2000lbs Though in some of my earlier books, I changed over 50% between first and last draft.
@up2000lbs I varies a lot based on the scene. Some get cut entirely.  Some remain relatively untouched.  On average, I keep around 75%.
@TheHachTag Hmm...  Looks like I need a book that starts with "Zud"
@TrinityGreer Thank you.  I hope you find Bands of Mourning an interesting compliment to it.
@LostCadence I'm not one to talk on this topic, though, as it's one that I find personally difficult.
@LostCadence The LDS church has a long history of being extra careful about when minors can join. Often, it's better for them to wait.
@LostCadence It's a divisive topic, even among members. The children thing isn't as bad as it looks, though.
@Dr4konian I sell signed copies of my books through various stores, but the shipping all that way is expensive. We do sell cheap book plates
@Sacae89 Currently, yes.
@mikezentz There was a Kaladin one last year, I believe.  https://t.co/TDVWBm6rTG has it somewhere.
@Reth_Bloodhand @NaNoWriMo Heh.  I think 300k words in a month is a LITTLE beyond even me.
As a note, today's scene from Oathbringer turned out particularly well.  Pretty hyped about this sequence as it's coming together.
@GoRangersUSAF Enjoy!  And thanks for reading.  Stay safe out there.
Today's @NaNoWriMo progress on Stormlight 3: 2719 words, which makes another % bar tick up, taking us to 23%. 9347 words so far this month.
@Destrus76 I speed up right near the end, and am often slower at the start, but for the most part, it's steady.
@Yourigath @PeterAhlstrom They are not all the same. And you'll have to wait and see on how that affects things.  :)
@kiwijordan I'm a planner/outliner for plots, though I tend to discovery write characters. (I talk about this a lot in my writing lectures.)
Final wordcount for yesterday was 2628, after a second writing session at night.  I'll let you know how today goes.
Goodreads Choice Awards First Round + Updates https://t.co/rJwvFx1nSB
@TheClumsyman That should work. If you're worried, just send a follow up email.
@1badpennyblog The team dynamic is an important part of the books, and of a good RPG session.
@1badpennyblog Focus on making sure every member of the team has something to add and to do that is important.
@Destrus76 @cobraspideyguy Yup.  This one should be about that length, much to my publisher's chagrin.
@chrismelotti Thanks!
@SussanRey17 The third book of the Stormlight archive, titled (most likely) Oathbringer.
@EricThePipe &lt;Joins you in evil laughter&gt;
@Dmon35 They're hard at work prowling around @PatrickRothfuss's house, hoping to get a peek at Kingkiller 3.
@RazRiverblade Yeah, I need to be careful about managing people's expectations on these. Fall looks possible, though.
@WhatSheepSaid Not exactly.  That's more of a worldbook. This is more like a very, very detailed glossary.
1850 words today so far, though I'll probably do another session tonight. Keep going on your @NaNoWriMo novels, everyone.
Here's an excerpt of the MYSTIC audiobook by @jasondenzel, narrated by @MaryRobinette. https://t.co/CoYzL4Mmhx
The Wheel of Time Companion and Mystic https://t.co/YqXUbD1Vv3
@BrentLooyenga Maybe next year this time.
@DrewKarpyshyn A lot of the writing you do is more concentrated though. I don't get 2k a day on scripts.
@Stillweather Ha.  I understand the sentiment and appreciate the enthusiasm.  :)
@johnlindquist I can type very fast, 80 or so, but rarely when writing does it come up.
@authorsahunt Eh, as you probably know, writing at the right length is more important than actual length. You could always put a length bar.
@Link_Law 400k, I'm afraid.  Book 4 could be 300, but book 3 has some of the longest sequences in the series.
@Hexy27Bernie1 Closer to 150, since I have about a quarter of the book done already.  But yes, I anticipate this being 400k words.
@authorsahunt I'm lucky in that, over time, I've been able to get a good feel for how long books will be.  Lets me do % bars easily.
@emilyandroses Ha!  That's super cool.
2k words yesterday, 2k more today. Not my fastest speed, but steady.  Stormlight 3 % bar is ready to inch up for the first time in a while.
Here is a podcast I did while on tour for #shadowsofself at the Tattered Cover in Denver. https://t.co/3wN9z0XCW1
In round 1 of the 2015 Goodreads Choice Awards, Shadows of Self is nominated https://t.co/AVvPc9Mj90 and Firefight https://t.co/UrJSaxgJkt
@TyMoseley Not unless they have a limit.  I do not. (Though I ask people to keep personalizations to a minimum.)
I saw this awesome shirt during my tour at Murder by the Book in Houston. #shadowsofself #mistborn https://t.co/nJgohtGSdh
@WhatSheepSaid Ha.  350k words in one month would be a stretch, even for me.  I'll be happy with 50k.
@Jonathan__Wood ...the excerpt looks good, and he should feel super proud. Most people never finish their novel, and he did.  Well done!
@Jonathan__Wood I don't have time to read even all my friends' books, so I don't know if I could ever get to this. But tell him (more)...
@callumke It was a lot of fun, Callum.  Good luck with your own writing this month.
@ChrisdeMercado I have no problem with it.  Keep writing!
Welcome to National Novel Writing Month, everyone. To celebrate, I'm back to working on Stormlight 3. (Finally.)
@wordlessrage It was an honor.
@theCViz Shardblades sever the soul from the body, but Awakening makes a "fake" soul for a body, so how the soul left doesn't matter.
@TheClumsyman I have considered.  Last one didn't materialize. Maybe next time.
@jsamtaylor Cool!
@bluejaybooks :)
@trainwrecked1 Rand.  The one power is far stronger than even compounding metals.
@Ethanreadsbooks Sorry. :(  No immediate plans.

Arrived in terminal one this time at Salt Lake Airport, so I signed at the Weller Book Works near security by the A gates.
@cassie_lb I did! But it will be nice to get home.
I connected through Chicago O'Hare on my way home. Find signed books at Barbara's Bookstore between H-K gates. Remember Steelheart in YA. :)

@mystyk_jade Wow!
@ParaGulls @BrentWeeks I SAID, when asked who I might want to finish my series if I died, Brent would be a great choice. Not that he'd do it
@MoodyPoison :)
Have managed to find the LDS church in Nottingham. Here is hoping they haven't rescheduled meetings unexpectedly like in London. :)

If anyone in the Nottingham area wants to play Magic with me tonight at 8pm, drop me an email through my website. Game is open to anyone.
@btownsley He is not.
@Truncarlos Was there last summer.  Might be a year or so before I return.
@RayReadsaLot I do have an event in Nottingham tonight!
Edinburgh! If you missed me last night, I left many signed books (with stickers inside as prizes) at the Blackwell's Books.
@vecna None so far!
Edinburgh! Come see me at 6:00. https://t.co/wM1zfkc88W Tomorrow: Leeds &amp; Nottingham, then FantasyCon in Nottingham this weekend.
@Miggzyy Yes, but the UK 10th anniversary isn't for a while yet.

@jtulkas2 Wow.  I rarely see people with all three.
@ReggTheSecond Vesuvan Doppleganger. Commander is Zedruu, but I rarely play.  I prefer drafting.
@RosaWatkinson All that is left is Edinburgh, Leeds, and Nottingham. :(
@jam_hop :(  I had to get on a train to Newcastle. But I did leave some signed copies.
@Bortne24 The talk tonight is organized by Waterstones, and they'll bring books for me to sign, theoretically. Those should go to the store
@SeanP28 Afraid not.
@AndrewMudge Tour schedule is on my website. Mostly in the north, I think. :(
@selkieskins I reckon he will.
Back in London, I signed books and put stickers  inside at the Waterstones at Oxford Street Plaza! @waterstonesoxsp https://t.co/j0eJIwg7Fx
@RayReadsaLot :)
@Szetak Whoops! Didn't even hear! Was thinking about a story.
UK Tour Continues + Updates  https://t.co/iYiKC1iMWF
London! I will be signing all my books (and reading from Stormlight 3) tonight at Forbidden Planet!
@whizzbee Very appropriate with the fog and all.
Doing Gollancz fest today in London with @LordGrimdark and others. Main signing is on Monday, though. Today's event is sold out.
@schawarmachine :(  I will be in London on Monday too.
@HansAntov Schedule here: http://t.co/edWOBwHT8B
@Saorchris Hey, at least I didn't call you English.
@michaelscurtis One of my novellas was on a .99 deal.  Might still be. @peterahlstrom
@capperz412 Thanks!
@michaelscurtis Us got mine for free last year.
@ayarocks http://t.co/edWOBwHT8B
@LittleChicken89 Schedule is here: http://t.co/edWOBwHT8B
@westwing1 Tour is here: http://t.co/edWOBwHT8B
Hey, Brits! I am here to see you. To celebrate, my publisher has put The Way of Kings, Steelheart, and Mistborn #1 on sale in ebook!
@AndrewF_Writer :)
@KomboDrop Yup. Might take a few weeks.
@Cristina_Bean :)  Were there many signed books left?
@Sylar147 I want to go some day for sure.  Not this trip, but maybe next.
Stopped at the M.I.T. Coop today &amp; signed some books. Tried to stealth it, but they spotted me. :) (Look in teen too) http://t.co/9U86nsvPKP
@RoyHartford Yes.
@Lobster667 Maybe near worldcon 2017
@ikourt Hitting Toronto next year.
@ReggTheSecond I promise to visit eventually.
@davitts12 Just UK. :(
@bmoorebooks One time.  Blue black control FTW.
@valorous_cloth Fallout 4
@topherknowles People do it all the time, and I don't mind. But I rarely get to any of them.
@NetworkIroning Very small tour for Calamity.
@elektrotal @MrsTad All Tor books are on bitlit. $3 ecopy if you have the print edition.
@thisisleejames I am flying first class with the hope of sleeping on the flight and not being too jet lagged.
@Krystal_Leger Someone gave me a pack as a joke.
@doug_justice So far so good!
@Strakul New one. Planned second trilogy is still coming.
@USFbull2281 I will try!
@trevorade I have one I have been working on for a while that might get some attention.
For MTG nerds, fans gave me 12 packs on the tour. Pulls: 3 mythics, 3 foil rares/basics, 2 duals, one (!) Expedition. http://t.co/bhug1OayTR
US tour is done! Thanks to all who came to see me. Off to the UK next.
New post up about the Mistborn mega-series. And Shadows of Self is out in hardcover in the UK today + my UK tour. http://t.co/cADTfOeea6
@AStirlingMacD theater in a few min.
@PTHylton That is secretly why I let them tour me.
@jkars10 My pleasure!
@EmilyOrange Theater shortly.
Boston. If you're early to my signing, I am going to go over to the theater in 5 min to sign your books. Lets you skip the long line after.
@PatrickRothfuss @longshotauthor Ha. They said,  and I quote, "You're lucky your book wasn't out. That guy was signing, like, everything."
@uastronomer This shouldn't be the case. @peterahlstrom?
@ralsina :(
Boston airport has signed books at Booklink, near gate A7. They claim @PatrickRothfuss was recently there signing @longshotauthor books...
I don't trust Boston traffic, so I'm having the driver take me right to the signing. I will be early, and will sign for those already there.
@Patrick0980228 No, unfortunately. Just a regular signing.
@ZanderHatch We are really close, but I think next spring is more realistic.
Ha! The gate staff just called up the frequent flyers, then WANDERED OFF and let us scan ourselves onto the plane. I love small airports.
@scalzi You have me there. :)
@JillAMyers I do! Details: http://t.co/OUG3ZjQgjj
@scalzi True, though the skyclub consists of a guy named Buddy holding a plate of Ritz crackers and humming Ode to Joy.
@SSmith1138 @TheKJA Really? We called the store and they said they would handle this.  :(
@ReaderCate Now with covers that I actually like!
@MrVicBam Brookline Booksmith. http://t.co/OUG3ZjQgjj
@kxu65 Most of my books sell in ebook.  Check the kindle store lists instead of the physical store lists.
@LifeBooksEscape You can bring any books you want, though remember if you didn't buy the new book from that store, you might need a ticket.
In the bustling Lansing airport, waiting for my flight to Boston.  I think there are more TSA officers here than there are airport patrons.
@20_million_bees Book five is coming out next summer!
@adhpearce Moar time plz. Thx.
@N4CAT I wonder about that myself...
Lansing! I am here! It is my first time here, I think. So I'm looking forward to seeing you! I'll arrive early to sign some before the event
@ericth2 :)
@GregoryEllner Alloy is somewhere after stormlight 5.
@NerdFlute I hope there will be one some day, but I have no news on when/if that will happen.
@mpsul2 Tour and revisions. :(
@PamRuesink We could tape me on your phone saying hello.
@HannahHaaaa Oh! The headphones were done by the US publisher. UK is doing lanyards and cards, I believe.
@aLouminumFalcon We are trying to stick you in a twilight zone episode where eventually, every piece of writing (including signs) is mine.
@jwebb058 Better copyedit.  Bonus materials in back.  No story changes.
@CyrielleIllyn Trying to get there fall 2016.
@j_e_willis Keep reading. :)
@mrkeithwrose Only in small, line edit ways.  (Plus some bonus material in the appendix.)
@GregoryEllner Just after.
@HelloTributes Out next February! Uk covers are awesome.
@HannahHaaaa I am in the UK this weekend and next. Check the events page on my website.
@Lucas_llca Afraid not.  I think I am in Toronto next year, but that might be my only Canadian stop.
Ohare airport! Barbara's Bookstore by gate E5. Many signed books and Mistborn Headphones for the first 2 people! http://t.co/CwZDlIxX5C
Chicago Ohare! Barbara's Bookstore, gate B12, has many signed books. Headphone sets hidden on top of the paperbacks. http://t.co/A04k2xB3X8
Reports coming in that Kindle US finally has the 10th anniversary Elantris. To get your ebook updated, contact Kindle customer support.
@BZelwen I believe it will.
@ericpeters We are giving them away. Come to a signing or watch my twitter between now and the next book in January.
@Blind_Jhon I stole that quote from @howardtayler. He said it once, and told him I would use it in a book some day.
@Ethanreadsbooks :)
@suearmitage This is always okay with me, though very rarely the bookstore has problems with it. I would bring them.
