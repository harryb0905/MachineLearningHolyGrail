FYI this won’t work on me — I am Jewish and I don’t want/have any friends ever for my whole life.
Next time you see someone you really want to meet (like a hot celeb) just be like “Hey we both have a really close friend in common.” and they’ll be like “Who?” and then you say “Jesus Christ, our lord and savior.” Then ask for his/her phone number.

Paxton “Pac” Pacman (b. May 1980-d. February 2018) was a yellow guy that ate small circles while getting chased by ghosts - unless he ate a big circle, then he’d eat ghosts kinda. He died in a gutter, eating cigs. He leaves behind either his girlfriend or sister? Not sure. https://t.co/nQnlrTD16G

Getting my teeth drilled and filled for the 10th time as an “adult”. Some see it as poor dental hygenie. I see it as a guy that treats each of his teeth like little newborn babies, swaddling them in heaps of ground beef and raisinettes to keep them feeling secure and warm.
It’s incredible that American Airlines insists that everyone aboard eat 4 complementary, piping hot soft shelled crabs within 15 seconds or else they won’t take off.

@bluandromeda Like why would someone want to call themselves trash/garbage? I get trying own derogatory statements about oneself, flip it around and make it about pride. But this trash thing is sort of like calling oneself a piece of shit. That’s not good at all. Not a healthy trend IMO.
@bluandromeda Yea, I personally think that’s really unfortunate. Genuinely funny self-deprication here-and-there is fine. Consistently calling oneself trash/garbage seems masochistic.
@magiccornlover It’s something that was written about me
I mean twitter btw. Not myself. I like me ok and do not approve of one calling themselves trash.

@briankeithdiaz I'd be fine with it. I think there's bigger issues plaguing women than bad dick N puss jokes.
@imLeor It seems fucking spot on to me
@imLeor Is that the guy famous for getting Lasik, but it never healed?
@airporteffect Dries Van Noten, they're a worthwhile purchase.
@AnnaGoldfarb Morning Anna! *waving with arms fully extended* Great vibes are being sent right back from LA.
@drewtoothpaste To be fair that's a very realistic depiction, and it liable to get ANYONE horny as heck.

If there is ANY way to help the victims of the Manchester attack from across the pond, please let me know. Words can't express my sorrow.
@David_Leavitt You're a total piece of shit.
@David_Leavitt It's cool! He always makes stupid jokes about horrific tragedies wherein innocent people are murdered. Totally ok &amp; not disgusting at all.

@ankdeer @ThMmrs I do not respect that ideology. It doesn't have a place with me.
@ankdeer @ThMmrs And claiming they are going to hurt America/Americans is unfounded. It's inhumane. It's xenophobic.
@ankdeer @ThMmrs 10s of thousands of Jews were denied entry to the US during the holocaust. As a Jew myself, I can't ignore the plight of innocent Syrians.
@ThMmrs @ankdeer Trump's ban failed. It is currently blocked. Your view of immigrants and refugees is unfortunate. This ban is clearly xenophobia at its core

@GoodGuyCameron @ztnewsinep Low blow, like giving out blow jobs? Can't stop, won't stop brah. Discourse isn't the same a "low blow job".
@ztnewsinep Your reasoning is that I didn't tweet about Obama 4 yrs ago, therefore I'm a hypocrite despite the fact I didn't back it then.
@PabloMarders @AngelaGalle924 Very anal of you https://t.co/XwMjQ0VFEU
@ztnewsinep Helping to whom? You? This is pointless.
@ztnewsinep I didn't back it in 2013, and I voted for Obama. Does it matter more if I tweeted it then? Tweet it or it didn't happen? C'mon.
@Cole_trainn__ Keep fake boxing a wax statue from your family trip to Madame Tussaud's, tough guy troll.
@ztnewsinep Don't think I tweeted anything about Obama in 2013, but comb away!
We should be aiding, not bombing. Trump is moronic &amp; conceited, so he started something awful to feel like a big boy. A most dangerous baby.

Just thinking about Thin Lizzy. Again.
I just hope Pennywise isn't exclusively aggressive. Part of his/Tim Curry's allure was the overly welcoming, creepy vibe.

@blurrrypilots I have not had fruit snacks in 20 years probably. I prefer regular old fruit. Hope that puts an end to it (it won't).

@tonythaxton @jonodiener HA!
@real_mrs_maslow I don't feel left out. I'm here. I'm doing the thing. But I appreciate the sentiment. I got it covered though.
@TheInfamousFall glad u dig! Hoping to make another cool guy one day. I love that thing too
@HF_Lumpadoodle thanks! Always got stuff going on, just gotta keep an eye/ear out
@95mgcftmerrick telecaster!
@zomacenro no worries
@blurryfacr 👍👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻
@bluebellhowell I think I got it. Thanks though!
@nickdiener scope the keely compressor https://t.co/ybuUhTSTts
@flamesponcl nope that's way nice to hear thanks!
@nialluhfficial hell no. That's for gross people
@zomacenro probably better you didn't tell me. Looking like a cartoon character isn't a life goal of mine.
@ForgotMyMantra some version of it at least. Sucks having to address it. such a weird moment in my life. Don't need reminders. I remember.
@nickdiener honestly the best wah out there is the fulltone Clyde deluxe. Also, get a great compressor. Retro 176. Big boi compressor.
@Kelso128 I don't feel that way. It's actually worse to have people keep telling me that. Things seemed ok to me!
@nialluhfficial looks like a big old baby! Give that boy some milk!
@trashsavethecat this the 2nd time someone has floated some ancient, depressing thing I said around the Internet that doesn't apply anymore
@BORROWOURLlGHT I don't really want to be reminded of it. It's sort of a dumb thing to have said publicly. And it's many years old.
@nickdiener @jonodiener I have it too. Both models.
@RealSabrinaRae if you say candy man 3 times at the poster a sweet riff will shoot out
@Kawaii_Corpse I'm cool, I feel fine. Everyone needs to hit the chill zone, take it ease, I'm a big boy. But thanks, I do appreciate it.
@wendyccervantes I don't feel that way. It's something I said 7 or 8 years ago. Life goes on. I'm ok. Thanks though.
@Britt_Masterson I truly wish they wouldn't
@hiattb is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Hey guys I appreciate the love but I'm all good. You guys are referencing an incredibly old quote of mine. Not applicable to current times.
@jonodiener @nickdiener oh shit that thing got a wizard neck?!
@nickdiener obviously a Steve vai bad horsey 2
@GMObandphan that's a very old quote &amp; not applicable to the band as it stands today but thank you
@thenames_becs get well soon, rough business
@holy_smokes13 nice of you to say!
@zomacenro had back surgery 4 months ago. That's why they said that. You could've said hi:)
@thenames_becs I definitely care
@Kyle_Ryan its obvious that one chick is about to smash level 46 in soda crush. Can't stop now.
@fobsus yes

@Ruhquel true
If you're pissed off just smash zombies. That's what Dying Light is good for.
@folieajoe I'm with ya. I just wanted to know what people liked better for streaming since that is where it's all headed. Like it or not.
Thanks everyone for the feedback. Definitely an interest of mine.
@barcodeblasters neither pays very well. Totally separate (and important) issue that I'm not interested in discussing on the net.
@papar0ach if only that was the way it went for everyone

Haven't listened to Don Cab in a while, but here I am.
@Ruthi_m not exactly what I mean. Twitter is the wrong place to elaborate. I don't even really care to be honest. Have a good one
@Ruthi_m I think you're giving it too much weight but we can agree to disagree. Take it easy
@Ruthi_m punk was a real movement. Hipster is a word applied to a bunch of jerks from dif sub cultures who like terrible things ironically.
@strssdout not sure yet. 'the moment' is really great.
@Ruthi_m Not as much a sub culture considering how mainstream the term is and how loosely and often it's applied. More of a buzz word to me.
@FaeryRae it's still not very good
@Ruthi_m you say hipsters (which means?), I say people who have limited options for beer

@folieakillme that's my life's motto in hashtag form
@mongolhorde you realize I don't know you and therefore I might assume you are a jerk, not a jokester (which I'm sure is your intent)
@TrillStump yes, that is much more important than just some hashtag though

@alyssapalencia LOVE! I wish more people watched it. Actually have the first episode of 2nd season to download. Thanks for reminding me!
@springy17 First 2 seasons were mostly cool. This new one is a giant pile of dog farts. Overall it was always walking the cheese fence.
@ImDocBenzedrine I hear ya, but next season could be wonderful w/ new cast and story. And if not, I'm glad this exists.
If it's on the WB, or has pirates, or bones, or crime scenes being investigated, or criminal's minds being examined, I'm out.
@pabloislove No please!
@joshfranceschy I enjoyed a few seasons. Got too goofy too quick. I hate Deb to boot. The Lithgow season was the apex for sure.
And it's not dark enough either. Sorry kiddos. I like to feel incredibly bad after I watch something.
For those who keep bringing it up, not into Sherlock. Too fast, too slick, too "fantastic" for me. At least the few episodes I've seen.

Staying up late, going over @thebandperry songs for @cmt crossroads tomorrow. Stoked.
@bjaaaaane haha id assume it'd bring up bad feelings
@mmmegan the get stoked!
In essence, yes RT @hurleyvxv: @trohman so it's like a mixtape or an ep or something like that
@Caitlinxrawr I don't think it's me giving attitude, it's clarified information so you guys know this isn't the NEW album. Just some tunes.
@ptrckstmp that's exactly what I'm not saying
@AlTheKiller by today's standards maybe, but if you listened to old punk records, they were about the same
@WhitWizzle and then no one would have a way to listen to them haha
@FRICKINIERO trying!
@Overcast_Kids that isn't always true actually. If you want to call it an album for yourself you can. But it isn't a new album.
@skyskyjensen yea, it's called Save Rock and Roll:)
FYI, #paxamdays isn't a new album, it's a collection of songs we did for fun w/ @TheRyanAdams. It's us letting out some demons. Our mixtape.

It was meant to be iconic RT @Autumnoutboy: @trohman was "half half a brain" meant to be ironic?
Overhead someone say they want to "make an art". I believe first they'd have to half half an brain.

@lauzenpopsy it is an existing area of the world
@Rubrum_Unus I vote Josh Brolin
@alvords2010 oh lord no
@ughmichael5sos no one said that
@ashleyriot not into it
@UzmaR13 Directing: I think so. Acting: no. And he's definitely wrong for Batman.
I'd be more into Ben Affleck directing the Man Of Steel sequel than actually being in it.

@petewentz I've heard the Seasonal Pumpkin Spice Urethral Neti Pot will really clear out the pipes and smooth out the wrinkles
I do appreciate the well-wishery however. Danke schoen (donkey shame).
More pseudoscience please!
Everyone is a doctor online! So I shouldn't take the antibiotics the real M.D. gave me? I'll do the hot water, thyme, ketchup &amp; raisin soup.
Bronchitis. I got it. It's awful.

Twitter is where I go to learn information about strangers I care not to know
@petewentz if you love those, check out Emanuel in Space. Lots of launch codes getting entered.
@RyBlackinton bringo!!
@kriskatinte I loved it. Not Sci Fi though
@DrumkitDumbkid Visually stunning in the theatre in 3D but not a solid movie
@I_and_my_soul 👎👎👎
@wtfstump I liked Prometheus. Time will definitely have to tell on that one.
@felicitykate I'm looking forward to that one but have heard bad things
@Eve_FOB_murphy I liked Super 8, but I don't feel like it was mind blowing
@krissii123 I back the new Star Treks to a degree out of that list
@FueledByGayness Do you mean the Korean horror/black comedy the Host? Cause that's a rad movie. Not sci-fi, but awesome.
@Doofyboywonder yes, tho
.@Tazkiah remakes don't count, originals only!
What modern sci-fi films do u think will become classics in the future? I think Looper, District 9, Attack The Block are a few to name.
