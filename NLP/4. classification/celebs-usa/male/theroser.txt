@Kristenlb1 so good to hear from ya. I am doing well, how are you? We're on tour again! Right now heading to Denver, CO 😄✌🏼️
@im_unshackled nothing but ❤️ for ya! 😎
@ChichartoDelena yea I know. Just don't stay at a @sheratonhotels. Don't want the same to happen to you!
@avie_89 you're the best 🙌
@shaunamariexo @sheratonhotels @spgassist thanks girl! Hope to see u at a show so so soon
@shaunamariexo @sheratonhotels @spgassist ha well just don't give your money to a Sheraton hotel in the future. Super corrupt company.
@RiskyBusinessAZ @sheratonhotels That's what we said to @spgassist but they made it clear they don't take responsibility for guest safety.
@avie_89 tell that to @sheratonhotels &amp; @spgassist haha
@avie_89 spoke to manager of hotel &amp; @spgassist / @sheratonhotels &amp; they said they'd file a report but they won't do anything to refund 😒
@TeamGleggie hopefully @sheratonhotels starts taking the safety of their guests more seriously! Miss u &amp; hope to see u on tour soon!
@shaunamariexo @sheratonhotels we'd probably have been better off there. Even complained to @spgassist &amp; they weren't willing to refund us.
@avie_89 we tried. No luck. @sheratonhotels &amp; @spgassist says our security isn't guaranteed.
@shaunamariexo @sheratonhotels 100% agreed. When we complained to the hotel they said that our security "isn't guaranteed"
@shaunamariexo @sheratonhotels I know right. Hotel let guests throw a rager &amp; at 4:30am a drunk guest kicked our van til they dented it.
@TeamGleggie so unfortunately we couldn't take it with us :(
@TeamGleggie it was our tour van. Guests threw a big party in the hotel parking lot &amp; a drunk guest kicked the door of our van til it broke
Heads up that u &amp; ur belongings aren't safe at @sheratonhotels. Stuff vandalized due to lack of security &amp; hotel says "not their problem" 😔
@spgassist sent you the details via DM.
@sheratonhotels never staying at a Sheraton again. Worst hotel experience. Things vandalized, no security, &amp; loud disturbances all night.

@Niklynn awesome! What role did he play in the movies? Ps went to wizarding world of Harry Potter a few weeks ago. It was magical! ✨
@HSandSSfanever sounds cool! Haven't heard of that movie. What's it all about?
@SmokeSeasonDuh but I do sing on the songs! Ps there are new songs in the pipeline where I am singing even more 🗣✨

Have you listened to #Ouroboros yet?! Let me know what you think! 😁https://t.co/gOXoGJde40
@RiskyBusinessAZ Happy Birthday!!! Congrats on reaching the 21st year of your existence. Thanks for being such a lovely human being 🍻👏🏼
Writing... Riffing... #fridaynightfeels
@im_unshackled lol well, you can never say never, so if the feelings are right, there's no major drama, then I don't see why not! 😬
@shaunamariexo I'm digging on Bibio, Miike Snow's new album, Pale Honey, Small Black, Stealing Sheep, Pr0files...
@RiskyBusinessAZ "So dream like you dreamed when kings and heartbeats kept moons pace." 😉
@DearlyChristina @RiskyBusinessAZ I did watch it! It was cool - I like anything Star Wars, so I have a biased opinion. 🙃 What'd u think?
@shaunamariexo this is a concept album of sorts, we wanted to book end the music, so it feels really cinematic. Plus, it was fun to create!
@avie_89 I don't know... What am I risking exactly? If it were a peanut butter and chocolate biscuit then maybe 🤔
@shaunamariexo yes I sure am! Have a question for me? ☺️
@foxydomino343 favorite song on the new EP would be a tie between Loose and Emilia... It's always hard to pick just one! 😆
@SmokeSeasonDuh @smokeseasonband that's a tough one, since all of the songs are our babies. Can't play favorites. That being said: Loose! 😊
@HSandSSfanever we are planning a tour, and I would LOVE to come to Canada! Don't have routing yet, but will let u know 🇨🇦 👍🏼
@HSandSSfanever had been around since Egyptian times. The snake eating its own tail. It's cyclicality, and the story arcs fit this concept.
@HSandSSfanever the album is really a concept album, there's a story line that runs through each song / music video. The ancient symbol...
@SmokeSeasonDuh lol can I say undecided?! Actually, I truly am. I plan on voting, and I guess I'll decide when I have to pick someone 😆
@ChichartoDelena ooh, good question... Right now I'm really digging on Bibio. He's a British producer / artist. Check out 'Feeling.' @Bibio
Happy Friday! With one week until the new EP coming out, I thought I'd let you guys ask me questions and whatnot... So, please, ask away!
@avie_89 happy birthday!!!! Hope the day is wonderful 👹

@avie_89 hell yes
@Dory468 we'll let us know when a Boston date is confirmed through our email list at https://t.co/xXHkAJW1ti so sign up :)
@Dory468 of course! We always take time to meet everyone who comes to our shows who wants to meet us.
@MiserereMei1 true artists know the roots of their influences. We spent our lives learning them. Not the same as having dreads cuz it's edgy
@Dory468 well we have a summer tour in the works and Boston is definitely on the list...
@Dory468 it means a ton to have a fan like u! Hope to see u when we're touring someday. What city r u in?
@avie_89 he's growing up nice and strong! I'm getting over the pregnancy 😂
@MiserereMei1 ur confusing cultural exchange for appropriation.  Exchange = mutual exchange of influence. Appropriation = theft. Look it up👍
@avie_89 yea! My mother is 100%. Her parents are from Kingston
@katwalcott awesome! Been a minute :) can't wait to get back to Canada with my new band. Hope to see u at a show when we do!
@Dory468 I'm good, thanks! How about u?
@ChichartoDelena thanks Leslie 😊
@msyazminenicole yeah.. Being offensive is gross. I'm with u girl 👍
@SmokeSeasonDuh the church of roser 🙀
@msyazminenicole they have really beautiful cultural significance if u research it. But I'm guessing that's not why he's wearing them 😹
@avie_89 hey girl! Everything will be all good :)
@Dory468 hi there!
@katwalcott 🙌 still a #biebs fan. Hoping he gets informed :)
We're just hoping you want to express yourself in a way that is not racially offensive to people like me (and many others), @justinbieber.
There are a lot of ways you can express yourself that do not offend, #biebs. U have the right 2 do w/e u want with your body, hair &amp; fashion
(Just ask @Zendaya how she felt when she was insulted for her dreads at an awards show, saying she must smell like "weed and oil")...
This privilege exempts white people from the same judgement/discrimination/persecution that #POC experience when wearing the same style.
This privilege categorizes Black hairstyles (which serve functional &amp; religious purposes) as "edgy/alternative" &amp; white styles as "normal."
This privilege is using what's spiritually/historically significant 2 another culture &amp; removing it from its cultural context w/o permission
When white people take minority cultures' traditions (like dreadlocks) to "express oneself", the only thing they're expressing is privilege.
Don't normally pipe in on these things but since I'm 1/2 Jamaican, figured I owed it to my roots. So, how do I feel about #biebs dreadlocks?

@LightcraftBob woah I didn't know that. Just awful.
@AmberRose343 I understand. I think we as humans just try to make sense of this all - when sometimes it just makes no sense at all.
@Mandy_Arp oh, wow that's crazy. So terrible. It makes my heart hurt.
@AmberRose343 however, I think we need reform to keep guns out of the hands of mentally unstable people. There has to be a better way.
@AmberRose343 I agree with you. People kill people for sure. I personally think guns are just a conduit to enable this violence...
Another mass shooting?! I fucking hate guns. Something has got to change. We need reform. Praying for the families affected. #Chattanooga

Happy St. Patricks Day! Look out for green Pitties out on the town... (Cc: @whoistempest) http://t.co/kJGIv81WRh
I propose that future discrepancies be handled by a panel of skilled musicians. It takes a discerning ear to hear what's actually happening.
The creative flow in music shouldn't be stifled. If you sample another song there should be credit - but we can't live in creative fear...
With there being so much grey area - between musical inspiration &amp; actual theft of ideas. Surely this jury should be made up of musicians?
I am worried for the future of music that the relatives of a deceased musician can easily sue another musician over claims of forgery...
Happy birthday @jizziemcguire! Good times last night. Hope to see you next week to celebrate the birth of your fellow Aries, @whoistempest.

In this age of truncated musical expression, listening to songs that don't stop at the 3:30 mark is a revelation. There is another way...
The shortest song on that album is over 4 minutes long, and the longest is over 11 minutes. In this age of musical ADD it's so refreshing...
Listened to 'Physical Graffiti' yesterday on the 40th anniversary of this Led Zeppelin release. While getting the led out it hit me...
Wow, I haven't heard it rain like this in LA in quite a long time. #catsanddogs #sky #pouring

After around 10 years I am finally going back to those little islands in the pacific. Maui bound...
Happy #FridayThe13th to all you ghouls and goblins out there.
My advise to everyone parking anywhere in any big city: don't leave anything of value in your car! It might not be there when you return.
Today when I realized my air bag had been nabbed it was awful. The terrible reality is that catching these criminals is near impossible...
In NYC about 10 years ago I had my iBook laptop stolen out of my car. It was the worst feeling to have a possession get taken from you...
@im_unshackled @whoistempest hey we haven't forgotten about you at all!
@shaunamariexo yep
@mads_x3 ghosts?! Perhaps. Well those 'ghosts' knew exactly what they were doing, and even left the broken door lock parts on my car 😒
@RiskyBusinessAZ but I rarely use my horn! I demand a recount 😠
@KayCecelia apparently the thieves get a lot of money for the airbag.. 😔
Got into my car this morning and was startled by this lovely sight. Has this happened to anybody else? http://t.co/tz8DB7le9D

If u haven't listened to @beck before, might I suggest my fav album of his: Mutations. For further listening check out: Midnight Vultures.
@TrippyTabitha that's why it behooves you to always do research &amp; think before you speak. He acts on impulse, and doesn't listen enough.
@foxydomino343 it honestly makes it hard for me to listen to Kanye, and I love his music too. You have to be humble or you will crumble.
@SofiAlesia that's a good point. Still it's hard to judge based on artistic merit when there is no level playing field.
If #Kanye calls himself a true artist then surely he can recognize another strong visionary presence such as #Beck. C'mon show some respect.
So #Beck won, cause his album is beautiful. Beyonce is of course incredible - but please, #Kanye do some research and show some respect...
Obviously the #Grammys can only have one best album winner - so putting Beck against Beyonce, when their music is worlds apart seems odd...
I've been a fan of #Beck for years. He's a true artist that evolves and changes, and makes the kind of music he is feeling at the time...
