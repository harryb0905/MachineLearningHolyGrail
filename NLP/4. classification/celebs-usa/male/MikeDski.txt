We spent 8 hours backcountry skiing to celebrate @kevinfogolin’s birthday on Saturday. I worked it out - less than 5 min was spent actually skiing powder. The other 7:55 was spent skinning, talking, riding lifts &amp; making fun of each other. Some things never change. #timetoplay https://t.co/LORpARrD8T

@SteepSkiing @SkiRacingMedia That’s sucks. Is the wind supposed to keep up over the next few days? It’s puking in Japan.

For those keeping score at home, it has stopped snowing in the southern parts of Japan. Also of note, I’ve skied everyday of this trip on my @salomon QST 99 skis. I fully stand behind my move toward narrower skis for 90% of my days. #timetoplay https://t.co/ADipCRqKV4
