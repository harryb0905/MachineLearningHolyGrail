@ChrisinQueens I agree! That would be the logical way to budget. But I don't think we can even have that conversation until the public feels the system is fair and equitable. Leaving loopholes wide open only feeds distrust.

Amid all the talk about wealth taxes, I consulted with tax accountants, lawyers, executives, political leaders and yes, billionaires, to find the biggest LOOPHOLES and INEQUITIES.   Here is where we should be focused: https://t.co/h5yyl5ZNcJ
@eisingerj I‚Äôm in favor of a transaction tax or a significantly higher capital gains rate for transactions within a one year period. I also like graduated brackets (downward) based on length of ownership to encourage long term investment.

@mallen_johnson i hugely respect @michaelhiltz. i take his view seriously. we disagree. i've said it before: i hate incentives. maybe @amazon would have come w/o them being dangled, but once they were + amazon chose lic, it made no sense to drive them out. (that was real goal of opposition)

@decklap @GregJKrieg @AOC I‚Äôve repeatedly said I wish incentives didn‚Äôt exist. (Read my feed.) But if you gave me the binary choice between offering an incentive that creates meaningful jobs or getting no jobs, the choice, to me, is clear.
@GregJKrieg You cover @AOC, right? "If we were willing to give away away $3 billion for this deal, we could invest $3 billion in our district ourselves if we want to. We could hire more teachers, we can fix our subways, we can put a lot of people to work for that money if we wanted to."
@chasingwaterme1 @owillis I have long sought a major revamp of the tax code so it can‚Äôt be gamed.
@mehughes124 Those companies are located in Manhattan. The goal was to bring a major tech company to Long Island City, a place that for decades has sought a major anchor tenant and been unable to attract one. That‚Äôs why it is the capital of NYC parking lots for taxicabs.
@owillis I‚Äôm shilling for jobs and revenues that will support our teachers, police, firefighters, public transportation, small businesses, parks and hospitals. Who are you shilling for?
Presented without comment. https://t.co/vA3B2KdExB
@MrRabble The Foxconn deal was terribly crafted. The Amazon one, assuming it wasn‚Äôt later renegotiated, actually has teeth.
There is a financial literacy epidemic in America.   Quick lesson: NYC wasn‚Äôt handing cash to Amazon. It was an incentive program based on job creation, producing tax revenue.   There isn‚Äôt a $3 billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education.
@PoliticsPoorly Let me leave this with you: The tax code is a mess and needs to be fixed. It has been corrupted by lobbyists and special interests. We must fix it.  I‚Äôve been writing about this for years.
@NatalieElsberg Totally agree. Subsidies shouldn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôd probably outlaw them if I could (though that would hurt the most vulnerable areas without attractive Econ/Edu ecosystems.) For NY, it was a missed opp at revenue for schools, subways, police, etc.
@yeleajay @amazon Let‚Äôs hope.
@AliceAlch6 @TheBubbleBubble ‚ÄúWell crafted‚Äù in that the incentives were not front loaded. Amazon had to produce the jobs to capture the incentives. Here is a good explainer: https://t.co/mFzWtfoid5
@FWC_Rift @ERattner1 NYC will be fine. But it is a missed opportunity.
@bardsilfan The missed opportunity is for Long Island City. Companies happily locate in Manhattan w/o subsidies. But, at least thus far, they haven‚Äôt been clamoring to move to Long Island City. As financial industry contracts, attracting tech companies to diversify NYC revenue base is key.
I would love to do away with subsidies for businesses, but the reality is they exist. Unlike many sweetheart deals, the one for Amazon was well crafted and would have created meaningful jobs and revenue for NYC. https://t.co/LwZn6WnDVv

@bergerdad Yep.
@joseph_st_onge What major tech company has created an HQ on Long Island City? Please name them.
@NaughtFollowers You tell me: If you gave me $3 billion and I handed you back $25 billion, who comes out ahead?
@librab103 I want to take your concerns seriously.  I‚Äôm worried there is a misunderstanding. The incentives were worth $3 billion. The tax revenue was worth $25 billion. That money doesn‚Äôt exist if they don‚Äôt come.
They won‚Äôt live in NY or pay taxes in NY? What are you talking about? NY just lost $25 billion in tax revenue. Do you have another plan that will create that kind of revenue to pay for our schools, roads, police and subways? https://t.co/SVobevGteY
@bergerdad Then some other state will be the beneficiary.
@librab103 They won‚Äôt live in NY or pay taxes in NY? What are you talking about? NY just lost $25 billion in tax revenue. Do you have another plan that will create that kind of revenue to pay for our schools, roads, police and subways?
@bhaynes291 Please don‚Äôt associate me with a side. My only side is facts. And truth.
@GLD_Live Amazon wasn‚Äôt building a warehouse in Long Island City. It was building an HQ with tech, engineering and executive jobs with salaries over $100k. And the company wouldn‚Äôt receive the incentives unless it made good on the promised jobs.
If you care about jobs and NYC, this is terrible news... https://t.co/6FiO2fstZT

@impcapital @jmargetta I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true. But then we‚Äôve turned ISA‚Äôs simply into a financial instrument rather than a wholesale rethink about how schools should be more incentived to educate toward outcomes ie jobs (which is what‚Äôs needed)
@jmargetta My sense is that it is very hard to make ISA‚Äôs work unless it is the economic model of most of the school. That‚Äôs how incentives get aligned. If most of the students are using classic loans and only a small portion use ISA‚Äôs, the entire model doesn‚Äôt work.

@AidanMcConnell @Visa I think you misunderstand. Credit card companies do not file anything related to gun purchases. And if the killers had to pay in cash, some wouldn‚Äôt have been been able to buy the guns and other gear they used.
@hale_razor Currently you can buy as many books as you want without laws requiring alerting a govt agency. Same with abortions. That isn‚Äôt the case for guns.  Please read the full article.
@detective27 If they had to use cash, many killers could afford the weapons. And the article explains how the credit card network could be used to track suspicious sales, not end gun sales entirely.
@ekmngrlz @opinion_joe @KLemkau The point has to be to make it more challenging for a mass killer to succeed. If it takes longer or they can‚Äôt buy all the weapons they want or they get a knock at the door ‚Äî all of those things could foil or reduce the chance of people getting killed. This is about saving kids.
@gibbyz7 Correcting: 217 people died. Hundreds injured.
@titusxpullo The point is the killers often don‚Äôt have enough cash to buy so many weapons.
@MD_Shall_Issue And gun retailers have to file to ATF if you legally buy more than 2 guns in 5 biz days.
@MD_Shall_Issue Maybe you misunderstand the current law. Banks are already *required* to file a suspicious activity report if you take out large quantities of cash.
@livcarville @columbiajourn @nytimes You are the best!!!
@gibbyz7 8 of the 13 deadliest in past decade used credit cards. 17 people died. Please read the article and share it. Thanks.

@JFD8 @FoxNews You should go watch the interview. Last 10 minutes especially.
and that's a wrap on this year's #dealbook Playing for the Long Term conference! Thanks for following along
Thiel: "On the record, I am not a vampire"  #dealbook
Thiel thinks there haven't been many breakthroughs in consumer internet businesses #dealbook
Thiel thinks the Democrats badly overplayed their hand re allegations that Trump is tied to the Russians. He also thinks he'll support Trump in 2020. #dealbook
Q: Do you think the economy is set to boom in 2020? Thiel: I do, actually.
Q: You don't think this president demagogues any more than his predecessors? Thiel: No. (And the nicknames, like "Low-energy Jeb," are incredibly accurate)
On polarization, Thiel says it's not healthy -- but thinks Trump isn't the main cause. "Not even remote[ly]"
Thiel thinks Obama and W both lied -- about ACA and being able to keep your doctor, and the Iraq war -- and that whatever lies Trump has told are not any bigger
How would he grade Trump's tenure? "I think it's been successful so far," citing the tax overhaul and deregulation. He also thinks Democrats have come around to Trump's thinking, broadly, on trade and China
What Thiel was thinking when he began supporting Trump: He was tired of consecutive economic bubbles under Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama. Trump threaded the needle and promised something different
Now up at the #dealbook conference: Peter Thiel
Blankfein on the current political atmosphere, where he was featured in an ad decrying globalists (alongside George Soros):  "This administration has been playing to the baser instincts of fringe-y elements."   #dealbook
When asked about 2 former Goldman bankers being charged in relation to the 1MDB Malaysian corruption scandal, Blankfein tells #dealbook conference: "When we see bad behavior, we jump on it."  Pressed, he adds that it appears a former banker lied and evaded firm controls
Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, speaking about the differences between him and his successor, David Solomon:  "He's a DJ. I'm a JD."  #dealbook
Q: Was Cohn ever really your successor? Blankfein: The job was not up for grabs at that time.
Q: How do you look at Gary Cohen's tenure in Washington? Blankfein: I think he was imbued by the same spirit as my last 5 predecessors. ... I think he was a dollar-a-year guy. ... On the whole, I think it was wholly positive for the stuff he got done
Blankfein says Goldman isn't incentivizing employees to go into government service -- the firm just removes the punitive aspect of doing so. (He's trying to counter the perception of Goldman promoting "Government Sachs" -- ie, the revolving door)
About those post-financial crisis bonuses: Blankfein says "it would have been a helluva lot worse if we lost the essence of our staff" because they didn't get paid
"In the absence of us defining what the firm does ... people filled that in."   Blankfein saying that Goldman bore a burden of not being well-known.
How did Goldman survive? "We weren't too smart, we weren't too dumb. We just managed to hedge our risk."
Blankfein is reminiscing about Goldman surviving the financial crisis and then the reputational hit that came afterward
Blankfein: I wrote a little departure note [to his successor as CEO, David Solomon]: When the times are bad, you can't leave, and when times are good, you don't want to leave
.@lloydblankfein of Goldman Sachs is up, and notes that he's a "stalwart" of the #dealbook conference
When asked whether Larry Page, CEO of Google's parent Alphabet, should be as accountable as Pichai, Pichai says the overall Alphabet business model is working the way it's supposed to
Pichai says at the #dealbook conference that his 11-year-old son is mining Ether
Re changes to Google's business model -- will it always be based on advertising? Pichai says they're exploring alternatives, such as YouTube and subscription models
Q: Is there a day when you think Google could be too big? Pichai: We're already pretty heavily regulated, including by laws like GDPR.
Pichai: "I think it's important that the US invests in AI" -- but there's global development of AI. "Based on what I can see coming out of China, there's impressive" work there as well.  But is this an AI race? Pichai says he doesn't view things through that lens.
Quoted Pence's comments demanding that Google stop work on its Chinese work, Project Dragonfly, Pichai says, first there are more companies doing work in China than we are. And we're happy to coordinate with the US government if need be
Asked about Google's work on China, Pichai says Google is always exploring things. "Our mission is to sell things to the world"
Q about James Damore: How do you balance that position with the culture? Pichai: "At the company we allow a lot of people to speak up, but we still have a code of conduct."
Pichai compares the decision not to pursue the Jedi AI contract with the Pentagon to geneticists drawing lines at genetic engineering
Pichai: "We do work with the military. ... We're committed to doing that." Adds that the military "protects us." And also, "It's a bit of a misunderstanding to say we won't work with the military."  But when it comes to AI, there are others who can provide these services [to DOD]
Pichai says Europe's new privacy law, GDPR, was important
"These are all cases where we've taken strong actions. In one case we terminated" an executive accused of sexual misconduct.  Pichai adds, Google has a very transparent culture compared to most other companies
"I don't think there was enough representation -- I think that's common in tech ... there needs to be a deeper look at whether this is more systemic"
More Pichai: We acknowledge that we need to do better. I'd also like to salute all the women stepping up
Q: When you see these headlines/employee unrest, what do you think? Pichai: Words aren't enough. We need to follow up with actions.
Up now at #dealbook conference: Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO
Q: The founders of Instagram just left Facebook. Would you ever go for a beer? Spiegel: Of course.
Q: What was the lesson of Instagram aping the most successful bits of Snapchat?  Spiegel: Keep innovating. *more prodding* Spiegel: In hindsight, we would have done more communicating about what made Snapchat different. ... It makes you feel good about yourself.
Q: What would it take for you to sell the company? *long pause* Spiegel: I'd have to talk to Bobby [Murphy, Snap's co-founder]
Spiegel, when asked about privacy, talks about the importance of machine learning
Spiegel's response to the departure of Kristen O'Hara, a senior executive who was going to be business chief -- and then days later wasn't: She was great, but we're happy with the person now in the role, Jeremi Gorman
How does Snap move forward with a young team -- and does it need adult supervision? Spiegel says Google was lucky to get Eric Schmidt, and otherwise the team is united around its mission
Spiegel brings up again the idea that Snapchat is a "social camera," because photos are the fastest way to communicate info
Care to comment on Google trying to buy Snap for $30bn? Spiegel laughs and says "No comment."  Even if Sundar Pichai is coming up later? Spiegel says, "Better ask him."
Spiegel -- who says "I don't see too much on Facebook because I'm not on there" -- thinks social networks have had a bumpy transition to social media. As smartphones got more popular and made easier for people to stay in touch, social networks changed and led to more noise
Does social media need to be more tightly regulated? Spiegel says if you're going to shape the minds of millions and millions of people, you need to be more mindful of what you say #dealbook
Up now at #dealbook conference: Evan Spiegel of Snap
Re Louis CK trying to make a comeback, Lakshmi says a comeback is possible -- but is nine months out of the limelight long enough?  She adds that maybe the Comedy Cellar, where CK made his post-scandal appearances, should maybe give women an opportunity to perform instead
"I invite companies to rethink this forced arbitration," Borders says.  Lakshmi adds, "The confidentiality agreement is a big part of this"
Should there be a law about male executives who change jobs after being accused of sexual misconduct? Borders of Times Up tells #dealbook conference that we need more transparency -- and that forced arbitration is a huge setback on that front
Lisa Borders of Times Up says that in many sectors "we don't have transparency on pay." That's how we get situations like Michelle Williams being paid far less than co-star Mark Wahlberg for "All the Money in the World" #dealbook
Padma Lakshmi says the #MeToo movement is about "not just rectifying but also changing the fabric of our culture" and providing women with support networks to know they're not alone #dealbook
More from Lakshmi: A woman told her, a guy I went to school with wrote to me and apologized. Lakshmi adds, We need to teach young men and boys that aggressiveness isn't the same as masculinity #dealbook
Padma Lakshmi at #dealbook conference on why she wrote this NYT Op-Ed (https://t.co/8JfMCRhT6s): She had been paying attention to the Kavanaugh hearings. "We like to think we made a lot of progress ... but it seemed like time had not moved at all"
To be clear, "that needs to be fixed" was what Frazier said
"Each business executive has to think about his or her legacy" Merck's Frazier tells #dealbook conference on companies trying to strike difficult balances -- in politics, on environmental, social and governance concerns and more
What's the most exciting thing in medicine right now? Frazier of Merck tells #dealbook conference it's gene therapy
Asked about the dearth of black CEOs in major companies, Frazier of Merck tells #dealbook conference that he was lucky to get a good education -- but only got that by taking a bus a long way away.  That needs to be fixed
"I don't think the government should be setting prices"
"This is a complicated issue," but adds, "Are we going to have a substantive conversation, or are we going to have a stupid conversation" of soundbites?
On drug prices, Frazier says there *is* a problem with healthcare costs in the US. He says drug pricing is the most transparent in the healthcare industry -- but only when drugs leave Merck's door. It's an critique of the supply chain and middlemen
He says headlines about Merck pulling out of an agreement to sell rotavirus vaccine to children in West Africa are misleading
Frazier adds that society is more polarized than ever. "I think the workplace is the last place in our society where people can't choose" whom they associate with. As in, it's a bastion of forcing diversity
And he notes that the US government is one of Merck's biggest customers
Frazier of Merck on why he stepped down from a presidential advisory board after Charlottesville: "I happen to believe that political speech, political discourse has consequences" #dealbook
Back at the #dealbook conference with Ken Frazier, Merck's CEO
@KeepingSunny Go look at the rest of the feed. Lots of tough questions.
Q: "Have you watched 'Succession'"? Lachlan Murdoch: "No, because I'm too busy watching 'Billions'"  #dealbook
On Megyn Kelly, Lachlan says he likes her work, but he's happy with Fox's current line-up. Thinks she's damaged now, but hopes she makes a comeback
More from Lachlan: "When we make mistakes, and all news orgs do mistakes, it's our responsibility to correct them"
Even when it comes to Fox News, most of the hours of programming doesn't feature that kind of content. He adds that the network's journalists need to correct mistakes they've made
What about today's political discourse, and Fox News's role in it? Lachlan Murdoch tells #dealbook conference, "You have to look at our platforms. And our biggest critics aren't watching Fox News"
Would Rupert ever sell the WSJ? Lachlan says, I never thought we'd sell the TV or movie studios, so who knows?
Would New Fox ever buy News Corp? Lachlan tells the #dealbook conference, "I don't see the industrial logic"
Asked if there was hesitance in a deal with Comcast, Lachlan said no -- but the Disney deal made more sense. But he thinks Brian Roberts will be a great steward of Britain's Sky, which Fox sought to buy
Murdochs asked themselves, could we get Fox to the same point Disney could? Answer was "no"
Lachlan Murdoch tells #dealbook conference that the journey to selling the bulk of Fox "took a long time":   ‚Ä¢ 18 months ago, Murdochs got a call from Verizon interested in a deal ‚Ä¢ A few months later, Iger of Disney called. "We immediately saw this was a great deal"
Now up at #dealbook conference: Lachlan Murdoch of new Fox, in a rare on-stage interview
Tina Brown (!) asks Vice's Dubuc at the #dealbook conference about the company's culture: "What is the kind of staying power of Vice?"  Dubuc: We're serving the upcoming generation of youth. And Vice is more than Shane [Smith].
Dubuc of Vice at #dealbook conference: "We're not just in the TV business to be in the TV business. We're in it for the ecosystem" -- ie, they're getting their content around the world. "If we didn't have 'Viceland'" that wouldn't have been possible
Dubuc of Vice Media on Vice's $5.7 billion valuation at #dealbook conference: Valuation only matters if you're for sale -- and we're not for sale.
Nancy Dubuc of Vice tells #dealbook crowd that she's working to move the company forward, with Shane Smith concentrating on content as chairman
We're back at the #dealbook conference. Make sure to go here for live updates: https://t.co/1KQ2mcHvL7
On diversity, GM's Barra says at the #dealbook conference companies need to develop talent from the beginning -- that's what helped her rise through the ranks
GM's Barra says at the #dealbook conference there's a big limitation of "ride-sharing 1.0": the driver. Once costs come down, a whole new world opens up
GM's Barra at #dealbook conference on what's realistic to have autonomous vehicles on the road: Driverless cars will be able to operate in geofenced areas next year
Now on stage @dealbook conference: Mary Barra, GM's chairwoman and CEO, here to talk about the car maker's transformation
What's harder, being a tech CEO or a sports team owner? Ballmer says owners are held to way more accountability than CEOs! #dealbook
Interestingly, when asked about tech companies working for the Pentagon, Ballmer asks the #dealbook crowd if they pay taxes. He then says, those are bets on the Dept of Defense -- so why shouldn't tech companies do so too?
Asked at the #dealbook conference if he'd bet on Microsoft or Alibaba, Steve Ballmer says Microsoft, obviously. "You gotta try harder!"

Larry Fink of BlackRock remains bearish on cryptocurrency at #dealbook conference. "I do not see a practical application"
Larry Fink of BlackRock tells the #dealbook conference that he thinks the US and China are on a path toward a full-fledged trade war
Ed Stack of Dick's Sporting Goods is speaking at the #dealbook conference about his retailer's decision to stop selling AR-15s. Says he had asked Congress to take action to curb gun violence "There are inconsistencies in gun laws that have to be changed."
Is BlackRock pushing retailers not to sell guns? Larry Fink says the firm was privately engaged with all of them #dealbook
More from BlackRock's Fink on Saudi Arabia at the #dealbook conference: "I never believed that decision [not to attend] would cost us all the business." He adds that his firm hasn't lost any business in the country.
BlackRock's Larry Fink at the #dealbook conference on not attending the big Saudi investment conference: "It was a hard decision." Notes that BlackRock made its decision to withdraw before the US government did

@tailorguitar @SquawkCNBC I did last Thursday. I was one of the first to do so -- and I did so publicly.
Just now: Larry Fink of @Blackrock and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone drop out of FII in Saudi Arabia, people briefed on decision say, following the disappearance Jamal Khashoggi.
Breaking: Jamie Dimon will not be attending the FII conference in Saudi Arabia amid reports of Jamal Khashoggi's murder.
This is moving. https://t.co/MLa7xBc5Fu
Quote: "I'm very troubled by the reports to date about Jamal Khashoggi. We are following the situation closely, and unless a substantially different set of fact emerges, I won't be attending the FII conference in Riyadh."
This is leadership: @Uber CEO @dkhos says he won't be going to Saudi conf. It's a meaningful decision since Saudi is a big investor in Uber and a Saudi govt rep sits on Uber's board.
I‚Äôm terribly distressed by the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and reports of his murder. I will no longer be participating in the Future¬†Investment¬†Initiative in Riyadh.

The "Stop Bezos Act" didn't call for increasing the minimum wage at Amazon. It called for a tax. (I guess you could argue it could then be redistributed as an increase in wages.) Read the Act + judge if there's a bit of spin going on: https://t.co/rZkoPq4Pba https://t.co/CsTLqHpGMT
@90bristolcourt still use it!
@DavidCrossUSAM @terranovajoe @jonnajarian @elonmusk David: Elon got a worse deal after rejecting the first one. He is paying 10m more and can‚Äôt be chairman for 3 years rather than two. He did not benefit from initially fighting the deal.
@Polixenes13 @nytimes By now, with the settlement public, it should be clear that my reporting was accurate and consistent. Please stop with your ad hominem attacks on my colleagues and myself.
Had to happen... https://t.co/6u2Sppg2w3
.@elonmusk + @tesla reaches settlement with SEC 48hrs after rejecting it. He remains CEO. ‚ÄúNo admit no deny‚Äù deal.   3 year no chairman title (up from 2 years)  $20 million penalty for Musk (up from $10m)  2 new independent directors

@Polixenes13 @elonmusk @nytimes @CNBC You‚Äôre misrepresenting the reporting. I reported from the start that the proposed settlement wouldn‚Äôt require him to relinquish his role as an officer and director of company. Giving up the chairman title for 2 years, as I said, was cosmetic.
@Polixenes13 @elonmusk @nytimes There was no time out as part of proposed. settlement. He would have remained CEO and a director of Tesla. He only wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep chairman title for 2 years, but that is strictly cosmetic. All of the reporting is consistent.
@IvanTheK exactly...that's why i was saying it isn't analogous...
@painfulshort @elonmusk I did not say that I agreed with his decision. I was simply trying to explain the thinking based on reporting. You're free to disagree with his thinking.
@IvanTheK I reported it this morning as did WSJ.
@EspTrades sure. even if you believe his intent, it doesn't matter. he could still be found guilty simply for being reckless, which is a much lower standard.

@arbissell If you can‚Äôt acknowledge that the synapses in @elonmusk‚Äôs brain are operating at a different speed than most people, you‚Äôre missing the point.
...in the end, @Tesla‚Äôs performance will be the ultimate measure.
...and that‚Äôs Elon‚Äôs biggest challenge. Discipline. His fans love it (or at least accept it). His detractors hate it (and say it leads to distrust.) The conundrum for all sides is squaring the circle of his off-the-charts brilliance with his missteps.
I‚Äôve now watched the entire @elonmusk interview w/@joerogan. In much of it, Musk comes across as a thoughtful visionary who is also pretty funny. It was actually an interesting interview (though not hard-hitting.) And then he smoked a blunt + that‚Äôs all anyone will talk about...
I‚Äôm working on up questions for my @timestalks with @elizabethforma in DC on Sept 13 about the 2008 financial collapse on the 10-year anniversary marking the crisis. Any q‚Äôs you want asked? And please come if you‚Äôre in DC: https://t.co/7nwy7LzcFe https://t.co/BeF00guU6B

@DennisDiehl @karaswisher @Gladwell Agreed. And that‚Äôs not what I said. Re-read the tweet. We need to challenge dangerous views. That‚Äôs the point. If you can‚Äôt understand where the dangerous view came from and why it is metastasizing, it is much harder to stop it.
Btw: I also totally respect folks like @JuddApatow who have every right to say they don‚Äôt want to be on the same stage. And I respect anyone who says they don‚Äôt want to watch an interview w/Bannon. That makes sense too.
I‚Äôm with you, @karaswisher and @Gladwell. I interview people all the time that I disagree with. Some of them might even have dangerous views. The point is to challenge those views and unpack them so we can have a better understanding of how they developed. https://t.co/9IGDzl5R8f

@PGunigantiAT @AbogadoMike my sense is that tmobile's ability to roll out 5g is ultimately limited without sprint...tmobile will roll out in some places, but not nationally. it will compete with at&amp;T and verizon only on margins as an independent
@Aarontastic @JohnHendel @dealbook The problem is we might be defining the market incorrectly. Even today, ATT and Verizon have one market and Sprint &amp; TMO have another. If ATT &amp; VZ do 5G and Sprint &amp; TMO are left behind, the competitive situation might turn worse. Just a thought.
@JohnHendel @dealbook btw, john, what do you think is going to happen?

@moorehn I was writing a column about how Wall Street was changing -- this is before Lehman fell -- and Tom just tossed that idea out there. I didn't appreciate what he was saying enough at the time.
In June 2008, Tom Wolfe told me: ‚ÄúI think that what‚Äôs going to come back to bite us is globalization. It‚Äôs never been tested. It‚Äôs like a Ponzi scheme in which we are the Ponzi and everyone else makes money except us.‚Äù
Quick Tom Wolfe story: When my editor asked me to come up w/ a dream list of people to ‚Äúblurb‚Äù Too Big to Fail, I put Tom at the top of the list expecting he‚Äôd say no. He read a draft &amp; immediately sent a brilliant quote back. After that, we decided we didn‚Äôt need any others.

@gigibsohn What people say and what they do are very different things. As I said in the piece, regulators may need ‚Äúto save us from ourselves.‚Äù  The idea that consumers have no option is wrong. They can stop using it. And, at least thus far, they haven‚Äôt.

@biggestmace @SquawkCNBC Josh is right. If most people understood what they agreed to do, they wouldn't be happy. But I'm not sure they wouldn't take the trade again.

@DmactotheD @dabeard @AP @NeverAgainMSD Amex doesn‚Äôt allow the purchase of porn online. Fine by me. If there is something you want to buy that a card doesn‚Äôt allow, get a different card or use a diff system. There are lots of stores that don‚Äôt take cards at all. That‚Äôs their choice.
@DougKass With respect Doug, does Jay know you‚Äôre broadcasting his routine? I can‚Äôt imagine he‚Äôd be cool with this. Hopefully, I‚Äôm wrong.
@ImJuliCaldwell @BB_Halce @dabeard @AP @NeverAgainMSD Some stores currently decide to only accept Visa or only take cash. The store is making a decision for u. If @mastercard decides it doesn‚Äôt want to associate its brand w/retailers that sell assault rifles used in school shootings, u can find another card company that likes that.

Questions for Facebook About Russia‚Äôs Use of Its Network from https://t.co/WhKLcZzn5v
@GrayLivesMatter @jonathanalter To be clear: The card issuer or network would end all business with a gun retailer that sells assault rifles and high capacity magazines. It wouldn't be per item. That's where the leverage lies for the banks to get those items off shelves. It would require enforcement.
@Rossputin @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Operation Choke Point was a govt led initiative that didn‚Äôt work for lots of reasons. What I‚Äôm suggesting is market oriented; banks can do what they choose.
@ksucats85 @PhilipRucker Way different and much more limited in scope.
@HoosierInfidel That was far too limited to the impact I‚Äôm talking about.
@profmjmack With apologies, the banks already do. They only loan money to certain people and companies. It is their prerogative. And it is your prerogative as the customer too.
@nategilson @danprimack They can accept cash. That‚Äôs fine. But without access to credit cards for any of their business, they‚Äôd have to think hard about what products they sell.

@ProfScottWinter @mcuban @stevenmnuchin1 @CNBC @FoxNewsResearch @JoeSaluzzi @PaulGlader Translation: ETPs are ETF's that are leveraged (with debt). They've become a big part of the market.

@PersisterSister No, I would not. What I was trying to suggest is that we need to have a convo about why these biased feelings persist among some people.
@MarcusMarkle @SRuhle @Google We need a convo about why these biases persist and why certain people feel the way they do. Unless that's addressed, it won't get better.
@GrandeDunesRE @IvanTheK @BeckyQuick thank YOU! i need that earlier!
@IvanTheK @BeckyQuick Mr. Wonderful is wearing a jacket so I thought I'd follow and class things up for the morning :)

@felixsalmon @IvanTheK Agreed!
@IvanTheK I could be wrong but I don't think he has a PhD in economics, like the recent Fed chiefs. That's what I meant. He has a master's, I think.
@jwoman @Recode @karaswisher That would be fun.

@KirkCheyfitz I totally hear you. But I'm not sure we are going to agree.
@KirkCheyfitz That's a strategy. Not a business structure.
@fmanjoo @FrankQuattrone @hblodget @MattRosoff @karaswisher @jgfarb @EdHammondNY @danacimilluca @m_delamerced @StevenLipin @GregRoumeliotis @JCMcCracken Agreed. Frank: The moral/ethical q you asked is a problem, for example, if source is leaking unwittingly/under duress + will hurt themselves
@FrankQuattrone @EdHammondNY @MattRosoff @karaswisher @jgfarb @hblodget @danacimilluca @m_delamerced @StevenLipin @GregRoumeliotis @JCMcCracken Now that is a fair q! I think about that often. To me, circumstances do matter. But transparency still triumphs as the best disinfectant.
@FrankQuattrone @EdHammondNY @MattRosoff @karaswisher @jgfarb @hblodget @danacimilluca @m_delamerced @StevenLipin @GregRoumeliotis @JCMcCracken 2/ ostensibly a corp leaker could face a civil case from someone who they owed a fiduciary duty. some may be protected by whistleblower rule
@FrankQuattrone @EdHammondNY @MattRosoff @karaswisher @jgfarb @hblodget @danacimilluca @m_delamerced @StevenLipin @GregRoumeliotis @JCMcCracken 1/ most states have some kind of "shield laws" to protect journalists reporting on leaks. so not illegal in most cases for the journalist.
@FrankQuattrone @hblodget @MattRosoff @karaswisher @jgfarb @EdHammondNY @danacimilluca @m_delamerced @StevenLipin @GregRoumeliotis @JCMcCracken I get you pt. But our job is to report what's REALLY happening. Not press release. That requires leaks. Messy, yes. But public benefits.
@jgfarb @EdHammondNY @FrankQuattrone @karaswisher @hblodget @danacimilluca @m_delamerced @StevenLipin @GregRoumeliotis @JCMcCracken I've never gotten a bonus for a scoop. But journalists that regularly get scoops do command higher compensation. That's the market.

@sarahlapolla ah! now i get it. thanks for the clarification!
@sarahlapolla Not sure I follow you on this. If you wrote a tweet about me, for example, and didn't include my handle but I saw it, I can't reply?
@noahmccormack If it was about a specific named police unit that also had some good cops in there, I actually might.
@noahmccormack Clever q. Point was I was simply trying to be fair. I was surprised you would criticize someone for that.
@noahmccormack Out of fairness. Some percentage of profs, students and alumni out there likely didn't engage in the bad behavior I described.

@palafo I recall being somewhat speechless during the commercial break when the segment ended.
@amitkjolly very nice to meet you!
@FrankLasCPA suddenly? always!
@Redheadretreat I hear you. It is not that I won't ever be satisfied. In this instance, the Ethics office of US just said it's problematic
@satex At most established news orgs, there are stringent policies on things like stock ownership.
@countryman100 @kevcirilli agreed. See my next tweets.
@satex If I run for office, sure. Public deserves it. But you don't have to read my articles or tweets or watch on TV if you don't want.
@QuantTrader You are right. Let's see. But my sense is that if he planned robust disclosure, it would have made sense to announce that.
When I suggested Trump get a corp monitor in my column last month, I wanted monitor to regularly write report to public. This isn't that.
@amandbrar agreed. See my next tweet on disclosure!
ICYMI: Trumps plan to donate foreign profits &amp; hire ethics adviser is good idea ONLY if there is disclosure for public accountability!
@jtl2000 you are right. see my next tweet. we need disclosure
@ChairmanF85 agreed. read the tweet I sent next!
@jkjdixon you're right. disclosure is needed. that was my next tweet
@gmsheehan yep. see my next tweet. you nailed the prob
@thehowie agreed. see next tweet
@DaveHormell1 agreed. see my next tweet
@Thabiso_XT see my next tweet!
The problem w/Trump's plan to donate foreign profits remains issue of disclosure. Public needs full disclosure for accountability + trust
Trump's plan to donate all profits from foreign money received by Trump Org is a unique and seemingly promising idea.
Trump Org's appointment of ethics adviser+compliance counsel is good  step. But only if the public trusts them. More disclosure would help.
Trump Org to appoint Ethics Adviser + Chief Compliance Counsel. Sounds a bit like corporate monitor. My prior column https://t.co/L6E5E5lDqX
@Capitol_Finance You're presuming these execs want to sell stock and buy treasuries. Only then is it a benifit.
@csissoko No. I'm saying is that it is exactly the same as if you owned the original asset.
@ClaudiaBarnet14 they pay taxes on sale of treasuries &amp; index funds, but they have to pay as if their basis was in the original asset.
@IvanTheK you are assuming the execs would seek to sell; most would not.
@lebas_janney @smerconish you assume that these nominees are desperate to sell stock to buy treasuries + indexes; they are clearly not.
@IvanTheK that happens no matter what assets you own.
@ohaiom thanks. i understand your thought but i still think it's not a huge benefit
@adrianraiford @PPokaski @nytpolitics @nytimes If there is way i could add a sentence to explain it better, I would.
@JWCjwc69 @nytpolitics @nytimes if they repeal estate tax, GS stock would transfer tax free same as index. So no diff. Do u not understand?
@JWCjwc69 @nytpolitics @nytimes again, either way, same situation. They either own GS stock or index but don't pay tax until sale
@ThumpForTrump @nytpolitics @dealbook @AndrewSorkin Either way, he would get taxed whenever he would sell or his estate would.
@ThumpForTrump @nytpolitics @dealbook @AndrewSorkin Or he could hold GS stock for life. From a tax perspective, no difference.
@atralph @jpmorgan @BeckyQuick I won't be but I believe that @megtirrell will be!
@AlxThomp Nope! Just a weird screw up. We are fixing it now.
@BRITTANYJAMON i'll prob be out a couple days next week...
@Henry_P_J thanks!

I've been hearing different explanations from "experts" on the tax rate. Please help solve the debate!
Q: Trump says he's closing carried interest loophole. He's also lowering biz rate to 15%. A PE exec will pay 33% (highest ordinary) or 15%?

@jamesykwak @DeanBaker13 james: you're right -- theoretically. in reality, biz is intertwined. transition = short term damage. maybe ok LT
@DeanBaker13 yes. elephant in room was how regulation would play out / new cap req
@DeanBaker13 bc banks will slow EVERYTHING they do as they break apart. look at what happened after crisis...loans slowed as banks adjusted.
@DeanBaker13 anytime we add laws that restructure industry, we need to eval short-term vs long term benefits. that's all i was saying.
@DeanBaker13 glass steagall might be fine or better long term. but if you're trying to improve economy/jobs NOW, hard to say it helps.
@DeanBaker13 reinstating glass steagall is negative in SHORT TERM. transition cost is REAL. intellectually dishonest to suggest otherwise.

@Jamie_Maz @MaddowBlog Yes, close tax loopholes. I write that all time. But math is still overwhelming. We need to do a lot of things.
@Jamie_Maz Ultimately I worry we will need even bigger safety net bc technology will take jobs. But there r fixes needed. Age, means, etc
@Jamie_Maz @MaddowBlog Tweet isn't endorsement of content. Nonetheless, entitlement reform is necessary. It is math. Means testing perhaps?

@rubinoftoronto If share price is your only measure, do u give oil ceo's credit when oil prices go up? Do u ding them when oil price drops?
@rubinoftoronto Let's agree to disagree on this one.
@rubinoftoronto When she first got hired, yes. Then she bought off the activist directors + filled board with her picks. Crony capitalism
@emilynussbaum So deserving! Huge congrats.
@rubinoftoronto You're missing the point. Anybody could have been CEO + its value would have increased because of the Alibaba stake.
@rubinoftoronto Created how? Yahoo core's profits have fallen dramatically. Stock is up because of Alibaba stake, which isn't her doing
@mcmurrab stock 2x is function of alibaba stake.  bless jerry yang! actual operational profits under mm have steadily fallen.
@bitfiddler  what shirt?
@FilmProfessor9 @SquawkCNBC what's the math on that? i'll try to ask him if you give it to me
@Henry_P_J ha! Not to comfy.
Jamie Dimon on how we talk about earnings: Stop comparing to analyst estimates. "Report two real numbers. This year vs last year." Agree!
@bristei @JBoorstin @WSJ @keachhagey So true, Brian. I miss these kinds of stories. There are few journalists working on them anymore.

Looking forward to live-tweeting #Billions premiere Sunday w/@briankoppelman @DavidLevien &amp; amazing team of writers  https://t.co/fAiTIkUWNC
@mcloughsfd Dunno. I didn't feel hungry for a good couple of hours. And felt very awake!
@mcloughsfd tasted great.
Heading over now to @TODAYshow to talk about our show @SHO_Billions premiering on Sunday at 10pm.  https://t.co/y6WHF58seP
I'll be doing this tomorrow. Any questions for this man? https://t.co/rtjvL7BoaK
Great @Variety cover shot of @lewis_damian &amp; Paul Giamatti for our upcoming show #Billions on @Showtime https://t.co/jZCO162wZX
Thanks for the great q's. This was a lot of fun.  https://t.co/zFYSVbVDDh
.@timmullaney @mashbusiness Dunno if Bobby would play. The odds aren't in his favor. And he cares about the odds. But the payoff is big!
.@mashbusiness Q11. First : Honesty and integrity matter. Second:  Don‚Äôt get too greedy. Third: Ask this q of Bobby Axelrod! #Billions
@JohnBanksJr @mashbusiness @mindmeister @evernote evernote is great! i use scannable
.@dpinsen @mashbusiness happy to talk #billions. what can i tell you?
.@mashbusiness Q10. Great q. If you can comfortably afford the debt payments, better to take the loan. But that's hard for most startups.
@vikngws what do you mean?
@CaptainKinnard @mashbusiness not horrible, but def harder...hey @jack..feature idea!
.@mashbusiness Q9. The advantage is capital and being on the public stage. The disadvantage is being on the public stage. #BizChats
@iamdaviddoswell @mashbusiness love em. it's a strange obsession, i know. i've tried every flavor. i buy them by the box.
.@mashbusiness @Samantha_Fong Q8. Investing in managers and infrastructure even when it feels too early. It's hard to be big w/o them.
.@mashbusiness typo! i meant "discipline."
.@mashbusiness Q7. Everyone says being private is better. But I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe early on. Being public brings disciple ‚Äì and capital
@virali007 @mashbusiness i doubt the pivot is now on renewables. it's take another decade...or many...
.@mashbusiness Q6. Your most important relationship may be with your lawyer. Not a good place to skimp. I'm serious. #BizChats
.@mashbusiness Q5. By the way, on the RxBars, I'm addicted to blueberry and pumpkin.
.@mashbusiness Q5. Also, I'm now into https://t.co/ufXzCRxPGQ for handwritten cards
.@mashbusiness Q5. Can‚Äôt live w/o my iPhone, TripIt, Boomerang Calendar, Uber, UP band, Buffer, Spotify, Texture &amp; RxBars!
.@mashbusiness Q4. Politely :)
.@mashbusiness Q3. Right now? Old school energy. Everything on sale‚Ä¶can‚Äôt stay that way forever. Also: Fintech. Banks will be disrupted.
.@mashbusiness Q2. Totally depends. Hoof it as long as you can. But don't wait to take money just when you need it. It might not be there.
@mashbusiness Q1. Angel investing is so much harder. We‚Äôre closer to 9th inning than 1st. Fundraising, my guess, will trail downward in 16.
Hey there. Excited to do this... https://t.co/rxLtIVE6QX

@AmericanAir To be clear, my disappointment wasn't about the bag itself, but how awfully your employee approached it. You lost me.
@AmericanAir Fit perfectly. Pic bad angle. Chaya, the boarding person, took glee in it. Almost kept me from boarding at all.
@VaBchJim @USAirways It fit perfectly. Never had a problem w/this bag. When I questioned the decision, they almost barred me from the plane!
@HefferonJoe @USAirways depends where you are watching it from. It is live in DC at 9am EST.

@ShoelessJoe1910 @ddayen no. jpm knew bear well + 60 hrs to study. hard to say chinese knew aig as well. chinese would have had 8 hrs, tops.
@ddayen it's preposterous chinese would have bought aig w/no diligence within hrs of bankruptcy. that's all greenberg has to sell public!
@ddayen remember: paulson knew chinese. they had done no diligence. if u need proof it wldnt have happened, see MS days later. they walked
@ddayen quick public answer: all these supposed "approaches" by china or middle east never would have turned into deals. and not in time.
@ddayen cool (on the cousin part.)
@ddayen ok...to be continued...
@ddayen the Dinallo opportunity didn't cover the hole, not by a longshot
@ddayen the chinese "interest" was bogus...a dozen "investors" went thru aig at the end and no one ponied up.
@ddayen what's new? we knew aig was denied bank holding co status.
@ddayen you agree "Greenberg is not a reliable narrator" right?
@ddayen there's no game changer in there. everyone's looking for new answers because nobody likes the current answers.
@ddayen hardly. whatever info was produced was either known or doesn't change the basic facts.

@JoshRosner I hear you. Not bowing out. Just have to go to sleep. Past my bedtime. Let's get a drink soon.
@JoshRosner @NYFed Maybe so. It doesn't have to be an either or. I pick all of the above.
@JoshRosner If only it was all his fault. It is more complicated. He was one of many who missed it. That point is well established. Gnight.
@JoshRosner I suspect he gets lumped into that group but maybe not.
@JoshRosner We are in agreement on this point. He failed in his role pre-crisis.
@JoshRosner Having said that, he helped keep us from toppling over. The question is how history will judge the totality of him
@JoshRosner Those are very much his failings. He missed the crisis in advance and he gave away a lot on the other side.
@JoshRosner His bias was always immediate "confidence" -- anything he thought could impact it, even temporarily, he thought was bad
@JoshRosner He would say, I think, that he was worried they wouldn't be able to raise matching funds &amp; that would undermine confidence.
@JoshRosner Sadly, that's exactly right.  Geithner says as much in the book.
@BillGriffeth @Kelly_Evans @CNBCClosingBell Love it but too slow
@zerohedge I'm not sure either are true. He said he reluctantly took Treasury but I quoted Rahm saying opposite. And he wanted Warburg gig.
@DaddyIsRight thanks!
@micolh this isn't about being liberal or not. sterling's language is disgusting &amp; indefensible. @billmaher's point re 4th amendment

So true! RT @JJODenver: @andrewrsorkin @retheauditors Hope and trust is cheap, fear expensive. Trust people and they remain trustworthy.

@retheauditors that may be the case. but i would argue twitter is not happy place. it is filled with complaints, snark and self-promotion.
@retheauditors it reinforces the fear part...filled with hate
@retheauditors i'm not against quality control. i'm against the culture of fear. it's not good for anyone. twitter doesn't help.
