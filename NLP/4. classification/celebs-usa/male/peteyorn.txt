Yes i did. I think a young jack johnson was also playing that day . It was pretty early days for me so the set was prb exclusively mftma songs and id bet a smiths cover like panic and maybe a Springsteen teaser. https://t.co/0FvPsdbi04

@cuzlarry My cuz!
@RolandPaints I guess it takes a village. Best to u thx for insight.
@RolandPaints Yeah i‚Äôve shot guns; Just saying a standard gun should do the self defense trick in a vast amount of circumstances, i‚Äôd think. Do people really need a semi auto gun to protect their home? Could it be considered excessive?
@RolandPaints I think what im really asking is why do these weapons exist, beyond background checks, mental wellness....why do assault rifles even exist for common society? Seems superfluous on the surface, but wtf do i know.
@RolandPaints I agree mental health a big deal. Regardless of reason to do a mass shooting, by definition you‚Äôre pretty much insane. Def no way to stop everyone but just seems there could be a little bit more of a hassle to get these weapons and ammo. At least as hard as a green card.
@RolandPaints Anyone can do bad shit at any time. Fouding fathers, right to bear arms...all good. But did they mean this? If nuclear weapons became as avail as information, did they mean that? I think they were wise, but of their time. Cant be taken literally without context of todays access.
@Chope217 Yeah we can wonder that for sure. But it seems there will always be a ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù. Not sure that is a justification for not taking action. Just wondering wtf ‚Äúmachine guns‚Äù exist for in public domain.
@RolandPaints Yeah but gimmie one reason ‚Äútechnically NOT machine guns‚Äù need to exist in common society ? Maybe i‚Äôm clueless. It‚Äôs very possible. For shitty deer hunters? Or for local militia so we dont get taken over by our local law enforcement? Is that the reason?

@teleken  tend to agree here. I think demos r special but after hearing a finished song that resonates, then you can go back 2 the seed. thx
@Verona83 yeah i like to see the progression. Where it started, the seed, and then where an artist/production can take it.
@six7six7 yeah sometimes the demo has a simplicity that rings truer than a super polished version.
What would u rather be exposed to first, a demo of a song or the finished recording?
