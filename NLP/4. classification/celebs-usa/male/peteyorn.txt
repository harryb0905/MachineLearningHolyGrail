@jackie_tipper @tipdawg99 Yes hes my fave
@JeremySisto @caratweets I feel that sadness all the time especially when i focus on the fleeting nature of stuff, typically w my daughter. I think the biggest antidote is to just stay in the present moment. The sadness usually comes cos we’re thinking about an idea of the future or missing the past.

That was a fun show!! I think people in the audience we’re smiling and really put me in a good mood. And there was some good whiskey backstage too. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/FnKuIQXcNn
Yes Apart is available right now on #vinyl while supplies last! #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/XOJz0HnUbA
I just loved the song so much and thought it would be a nice addition to the breakup album. Originally i was gonna sing it w/ sj but she sounded so good i just stepped out of the way. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/bUnKdHe19E
Four out of five @ArcticMonkeys #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/v35bBJEqnB
Ahh. I do think there’s always an emotional quality that comes out in my songs. Im actually drawn to that. I don’t know if i fit into “emo” as a genre, but I’m def always looking for the “feeling” in my own work. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/AWLjd4HUUB
Honestly she’s just a great person to be around and she makes me laugh. She sings pretty great too. Xx #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/T9X5nT3sTy
#BlackWidow forever!! #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/4rvWAsXoTe
Not sure about recording but the most fun is definitely “Tomorrow”, something about the way we harmonize feels really satisfying live. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/PWsHICjFu8
Ahh good memories w/ @mattgood that was a fun session in Vancouver. Love that song. https://t.co/0ymfnIp9h3
Ah ...sophie muller the director came up with the concept, she always envisioned driving; she was inspired by the david lynch reboot of twin peaks, as was sj. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/6VxzNHJSvv
Easy: smiths, cure, rem. It all started there when i was around 12 years old and learned guitar. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/6ebulz1yWT
I think “movies” came together the quickest. I had written lyrics one morning and walt vincent had the music ready to go. “Cigarillo” took the longest cos i kept changing the lyrics and the arrangement. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/PzfavfURNY
Thx michael. That song is very close to my heart; it is basically about dealing with mental illness of a loved one and worrying that those demons might take me over. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/RZBISYdLUE
Thx kevin. Yeah i think i most likely will. Hope to see u. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/FVbcKidqHT
I would say it’s the aftermath of a breakup, and sonically feels very different than our last record, different producer who did a lot of my early solo albums, r. Walt vincent. #AskPeteYorn https://t.co/Pc8eAMvrCx

@cuzlarry My cuz!
@RolandPaints I guess it takes a village. Best to u thx for insight.
@RolandPaints Yeah i’ve shot guns; Just saying a standard gun should do the self defense trick in a vast amount of circumstances, i’d think. Do people really need a semi auto gun to protect their home? Could it be considered excessive?
@RolandPaints I think what im really asking is why do these weapons exist, beyond background checks, mental wellness....why do assault rifles even exist for common society? Seems superfluous on the surface, but wtf do i know.
@RolandPaints I agree mental health a big deal. Regardless of reason to do a mass shooting, by definition you’re pretty much insane. Def no way to stop everyone but just seems there could be a little bit more of a hassle to get these weapons and ammo. At least as hard as a green card.
@RolandPaints Anyone can do bad shit at any time. Fouding fathers, right to bear arms...all good. But did they mean this? If nuclear weapons became as avail as information, did they mean that? I think they were wise, but of their time. Cant be taken literally without context of todays access.
@Chope217 Yeah we can wonder that for sure. But it seems there will always be a “what’s next”. Not sure that is a justification for not taking action. Just wondering wtf “machine guns” exist for in public domain.
@RolandPaints Yeah but gimmie one reason “technically NOT machine guns” need to exist in common society ? Maybe i’m clueless. It’s very possible. For shitty deer hunters? Or for local militia so we dont get taken over by our local law enforcement? Is that the reason?

@teleken  tend to agree here. I think demos r special but after hearing a finished song that resonates, then you can go back 2 the seed. thx
@Verona83 yeah i like to see the progression. Where it started, the seed, and then where an artist/production can take it.
@six7six7 yeah sometimes the demo has a simplicity that rings truer than a super polished version.
