I swear there were dudes more talented or just as, but they went to the wrong school.
I’m blessed I lived in a zip code in middle school and high school that had great sport programs. #Chastain #Murrah it shaped my life with the exposure I received. I could have lived five blocks away with the same game and less exposure and you would have never heard of me.

@DeionSanders Let em live Prime
But what I don’t agree with is that it affects your overall percentage beyond the 3 point line. That’s unfair. When the 3 point line was added, so was a stat
If you go back and watch every opportunity in a game where I had the chance to shoot a end of quarter heave, I have never not gotten the shot of before the buzzer. NEVER. I always felt like I can make it. I practice those shots.
@EthanTDK @WorldWideWob Thank you, I didn’t know. But the issue is it still goes to your overall 3point percentage
@JGleas Didn’t know that. But in the NBA, it’s recorded. That attempt is on the state sheet
@nbamark What I’m saying is it should be it’s own stats and percentage
@josh2saint @bball_ref Is that real?
@BigPoppaToph @andrewlangan1 @WorldWideWob But it does, they take your stats. You get paid off stats.
#realtalk https://t.co/TWYtBGXja1
@DanielCermak_ @WorldWideWob It should count but a different stat.
@andrewlangan1 @WorldWideWob Yes but it should be a different stat. When you get a tech it don’t count as a personal foul. In actually it is a personal foul. It’s just called a technical foul. 2 different stats that don’t coincide with one another. #thatsmypoint
Yea not when your contract is up. They go by hard numbers. If you shoot 38% from the 3 and you have shot 25 heavs from half court. Probably could’ve been over 40% and that’s considered a knockdown shooter. It don’t add up and players know that https://t.co/XhgFyTu4xE
@ChrisHarrisBB It’s tough on y’all boys
Love it https://t.co/BTrNhp4cbS
Analytics I have a question. Can we stop penalizing players for end of quarter half court or full court shots. We have a stat for everything else, why not that?  It shouldn’t count against your shooting percentage. That’s why all these players don’t shoot it and it drives me cray

Play by play from my 4th grader coming tmrw.
Damn I missed a good one. They took they 1st L of the yr. they now 5-1.  The score was 38-37 and my son caught fire again with 28 points
25 now and up 1 point
23 now. Down 1
4th quarter just started. My 3rd grader team losing 32-28.  My son has 20 going into to 4th.  Let's get this dub #cheeringfromphilly
My parents being at my games motivated me.  #whenthatdaycomesimnotmissing1game
I have missed every game of my high school son season.  These absence pains me, because it meant the world to me that my parents was there.
My son has a game today and I'm missing it. My other son has a game tmrw n I will miss that also.
