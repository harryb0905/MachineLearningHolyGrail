@Dzayrozay10 @queenbsupreme Lmao!!!
My mother tells me how proud I make her and that I’m an amazing man and all I ever wanted to do was make sure my mother and father were proud of me. Finally I got my shit together. It’s the best feeling ever. https://t.co/TKwfXkdgq3
I really appreciate that. I can’t be mean. It’s just not in my nature my parents raised me better than that. I know my dad would be proud of me if he was still with us. https://t.co/TKwfXkdgq3

You need to stop. I’ve asked you so many times. I don’t care about you or your friends so please go away and call it a day. I don’t want you as a fan and I don’t want you at my shows thank you. Stay out of my life. https://t.co/iVTjQTWnOO

Please stop tweeting at me. I asked nicely many times, I’m NOT apologizing for anything. I didn’t postpone UK the promoters did. I’ve never felt so disrespected by a country like this in my life. This isn’t political this is disrespect https://t.co/CDlPoCP8KE
I do NOT owe anyone an apology because the promoters decided to postpone dates... completely out of my control. You all are taking this way to far. I’m not apologizing. https://t.co/mfrM5wrguW
I will be there soon I promise. https://t.co/h7g35Zmh7U
And that’s why my brothers solo album was advertised on my third album on the actually cd in 2002 my countless headlining tours and my current streams. Please stop. https://t.co/1r59xyWiBI
I’ve asked you several times to stop I’ve never asked my brother for anything and I’m successful as a solo artist on my own. Stop trying to gaslight me. I’m not into psychological warfare. Enough. I’m not going to bully you. So leave me alone. PLEASE STOP FOLLWING ME https://t.co/1r59xyWiBI

I’m sorry you feel that way. Please stop following my account and leave me alone. I don’t need you as a fan or supporter. Thank you. Now kindly move on with your life, stay out of mine. https://t.co/MHRQsVRvvT
I’ve asked you guys several times to please leave me alone. And stop paying attention to my life and career. What’s so hard to understand about that? Please hav some respect for me and yourselves. Thank you. https://t.co/blE01sPAEG
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO SEES ME FOR WHO I AM AND ACCEPTS ME FOR WHAT I AM. Very appreciative of your words. 🙌🏻🤴🏼 https://t.co/lVYE30PgCg

Please don’t follow me and stop paying attention to my career and my life. Thank you. I love how people resort to insults in order to make themselves feel better after they get put in their place. I’m sure lots of you are texting your friends and trying to get them to defend u.👀 https://t.co/L8odpQNgza
Please respect my wishes and don’t follow me or my career and life. Thank you. That goes for you too @nickschickuk you’re both absolutely appalling. I don’t need to be bullied by you two so leave me alone. Thank you. https://t.co/U8U0icKJ0I

I absolutely will. Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 is a beautiful country just let me know and I’m there to give y’all my heart and soul. https://t.co/ugd5gFMWcn
I can’t live my life thinking that I NEED fans it’s like imprisoning myself. If you want to support me for who I am great if not, that’s ok too. I’ll be fine. I have a beautiful life ahead of me.
I don’t need you as a fan, nor do I want you as my fan. Please stop paying attention to my life and my career. Take care. I’m sure you can find another artist to appreciate. Wish you all the best. https://t.co/Hijl3MfCY3
Both. In Jan -Feb 2019 No joke. https://t.co/yzERDMVKC0
I have my own opinion on that.  But I bet your grandma is super cool 😎 https://t.co/GPkJyYLrVm
You’re one of the “few” blessed to have you. I LOVE the UK 🇬🇧 Doesn’t mean I have to like everyone from your country 🤷🏼‍♂️ and tbh most have been very disrespectful as you’ve seen. https://t.co/Od348b75jk
Oh I promise I won’t 🇫🇷 can’t wait to see you all in France. https://t.co/gjsYY6mg05
Opinions are like assholes everyone has them. Please don’t follow me or pay attention to my life or career I don’t need it. Take care. https://t.co/8UqpzRDfoU
Fuck yea!! There you are it’s good to see a few of you left. 🙏🏻🤴🏼 https://t.co/nBRxHojYCZ
It’s ok. I always rise above. What everyone needs to understand about me is that I’ll never give up no matter how hard it gets. Also, when I need help I get it. And I’m not ashamed of that. https://t.co/A9XXGlWZx1
And you can. And too WILL I’m always here for you. https://t.co/NNbPpxOCxc
No one can bring me down. my mother and father raised me to be a very strong man. I got weak for a bit. But now I’m back to myself again. 🙏🏻 my life is taking a different path now. https://t.co/ZHFOgrdrwo
I don’t need a social media manager, nor do I need to constantly be explaining myself to rude ungrateful people. You should take a seat before you come at me on some dictating political type aspect that has nothing to do with your perspective. Stop following me and my life/career https://t.co/nE1te0xqSW
I am in feb 2019 https://t.co/RRrtDnhQ63
Soooo happy I have the most beautiful woman by my side who understands me and we are very excited to start our family together 🤴🏼👸🏻 https://t.co/QhVr3Z0SZY
And you saved mine. https://t.co/FwVjxcmglq
I know how to sort the real ones from the fakes. You’re a real one. I adore you. https://t.co/QrrxSjHzYX
Not sure why you are not going.... https://t.co/GSCjPcjxHP
They’re not fans. They’re hecklers and entitled thinking I owe them everything but I don’t. I’m in a very good place in my life. I’m also the first to tell you all when I’m not. https://t.co/L6lvRn3Jnz
It’s ok, I know it’s not all the Ü.K fans but a lot of them unfortunately. So I’ll have to keep my distance for a bit. I had fans flying 13 hours to see me in Manila so if my U.K fans want to see me you know where to find me in December https://t.co/s7b6RzCaif
I appreciate your advice love but I’ve been through enough in my life to know how to handle any situation that comes my way. Thank you though. I just do what I feel because I have no fear of what and who I am. https://t.co/zcRW8gYQLK
And I’ll never stop loving my real ones. https://t.co/hlh2EgSmkw
I’ll be in Berlin and cologne come to one of the shows 🙌🏻 in December https://t.co/DA4meYoHpH
I already miss my Philippines 🇵🇭 fans I haven’t had that much love from my fans is so many years all the gifts and love and knowing all my new music I was so happy I can’t wait to see you all again soon. 🙌🏻🙏🏻🤴🏼 https://t.co/oZyubxoGqc
I will. I have a new family I’m starting and I’m going to be marrying into my woman’s family. Like I’ve said I’m not perfect I do my best everyday. https://t.co/rvfVAGHjf8
Some of these Ü.K people are so rude. I’m in shock. Wow. ✋ https://t.co/SvoYpgjsFw
Another Ü.K fan being completely disrespectful and not paying attention to everything I’ve been tweeting. What’s wrong with some of you guys over there? These aren’t the fans I know in England. I haven’t stopped explaining myself. https://t.co/LdVf9q0iNu
You’re absolutely wrong about that. He absolutely did. And it’s extremely disrespectful. Get your facts straight please before you go defending someone you DONT know. https://t.co/z0t72h1hVu
It’s unfortunate And very sad to see people who follow me and call themselves my fans treat me like I’m a movie theatre. https://t.co/uOFgLHN5b5
I’m handling everything just fine. Maybe people can learn from how I am handling this with respect towards people who degrade me and demoralize me everyday I can take the heat in the kitcheN ALWAYS that why I’m cooking up 👨‍🍳 ☺️ https://t.co/M6O4m9tR2m
You’re so kind thank you.  I knew there was more than a “few” of you left 🙏🏻🤴🏼 https://t.co/wGCJUBWnhH
Facts. I didn’t see any of my U.K fans talking about me coming at all. But I’ll be in Germany 🇩🇪 Austria 🇦🇹 Denmark 🇩🇰 Netherlands 🇳🇱 in December. See you there https://t.co/lgrQP04qZ0 https://t.co/hOfak6zCDt
I’m not perfect. But I will show people how to deal with hate and negativity in a respectful manner whilst gettin your point across. I’m a leader. https://t.co/l0gXzYfDzE
This is truly disappointing and it’s not ALL my U.K fans that are treating me this way it’s people from many different countries. It’s ok though I will continue to stand up for myself with dignity and respect for myself and others. https://t.co/ITAHQ4CWkK
I would LOVE THAT!! My agents are booking me so many international dates, I’m very grateful to be back. I worked really hard to get back to where I am today. https://t.co/GidbrkJv7U
You absolutely do matter. But my health and my family I am building now is going to come first. I can handle the heat. That’s why I’m in the kitchen right now 👨‍🍳 https://t.co/57d1LWYsnT
It’s ok. I’m sure a lot of people will apologize and a lot won’t and that’s ok. Some apologies I’ll accept some I won’t. But one thing is for certain. I am keeping my distance from the Ü.K for a bit. I don’t need extra anxiety in my life. Thank you for being a real one https://t.co/RfXzDmSvNa
I love you too. Thank you for being so kind and understanding. Very refreshing. https://t.co/Gax11OsLSN
I’m won’t be returning. Thanks. And don’t think I don’t know you cause we’ve met several times and you always apologize for your behavior. I will not accept it anymore. Take care. https://t.co/pALGOEPnnx
Im not complaining I’m constantly explaining. Please stop following my life and my career. Thanks. https://t.co/pZ3fpLUCLU
That means the world to me. I won’t let you down. https://t.co/OiHg8HsOX2
I’m sorry you feel that way. Please stop paying attention to my life and career. Wish you nothing but the best. 👍🏻 https://t.co/7GP3JeRwRn
I am in February 2019 ☺️ https://t.co/OQ0QShEnXc
Ofcourse I would but I didn’t take your money. https://t.co/RvNFzCOcIM
See you in January #LasVegas!! I’m performing at  @HOBLasVegas - B Side; January 29th!   Tickets: https://t.co/dZvjQh78PP https://t.co/hgvfAxEYc8
I wish you the best of luck with your lives then. I know my real U.K fans. thanks. Oh and you’re not one of them. You can stop paying attention to my career and life now. Take care. https://t.co/Wi0bhClg3g
Almost home.... few more hours of flying... hope everyone has an incredible day. https://t.co/nvhqzLoqnA
My darling is passed out on my lap right now and we have 3 more hours left of flying 18 hours from Manila. We’re headed back to our home and prepping for thanksgiving with her family are our house. I’m so excited. Her family has taken me in and I love them dearly https://t.co/W0AmYBFkRF
I don’t have time for negative energy in my life. I’m on a different path now. https://t.co/sYIUZaVJjZ
You do matter, what have you the inclination that people who have respect don’t matter? Is it because I’m being attacked right now? It’s ok. I love my real fans they know it. Read my mentions. Thanks. https://t.co/57d1LWYsnT
I DO mind and they DO MATTER https://t.co/I79k53tsEr
It’s all good, it’s clear that the FEW fans in the U.K I HAVE LEFT aren’t appreciative of my love I’ve had for them for the last 21 years. I’m going to keep my distance for awhile. https://t.co/YnTLxzJFXu
It’s really disappointing. I don’t even want to come back now. I have such a bad taste in my mouth about my few fans I have left in the Ü.K so I’ll just keep my distance. https://t.co/ePpPcgslCW
What’s wrong with you guys? I will always stand up for myself, this behavior from you all in the Ü.K is unacceptable, I don’t need to come back if this is how I’m going to be treated. I have many other countries that would appreciate me coming to their country and giving my all https://t.co/NNIcXyCg7Y
It’s ok. It hurts at times that people don’t see the good I have done and the fact that I have spent my entire life trying to make people I don’t know proud of me. https://t.co/uhL8EvDNoZ
I’m not wasting anything. Just let me be me and speak my mind, I’m not sitting here dictating people lives like SOME. 🤷🏼‍♂️🤴🏼 https://t.co/G4zMDocOsb
I care about everyone. That’s the person I am. What you just said to me is the person YOU are. You can be you and I can be me. https://t.co/IzZe9pewp4
I am extremely calm. I’m flying back to LAX w the love of my life and just had an amazing show in Manila Philippines 🇵🇭 their love and support is incredible. I don’t block people anymore and I speak with dignity facts and respect. Even when I’m being attacked. 🤴🏼 https://t.co/cQB0wIofRI
Let’s do the math. I just bought my first home I co-produced an incredible new album and wrote it, my taxes are paid and I do 200 plus shows a year &amp; tv &amp; film? I have had struggles. It’s really cool to meet a perfect human like you though 👌🏼 https://t.co/BmKxWawdU8
You should be kicked off twitter for that tweet. I’ve had many struggles and been entirely honest with my fans about shit I didn’t have to be. https://t.co/BmKxWawdU8
You follow me and call yourself a fan? Smh 🤦🏼‍♂️ some human beings are beyond foul. Please get some help. https://t.co/BmKxWawdU8
Your five seconds of fame is up. Go on with your life now. 👍🏻 and leave mine alone. https://t.co/wv0O6yiaM8
It’s ok. I’m so happy with my life and I adore my TRUE FANS. oh &amp; for the record. I never forget ANYONE so if you want to treat me like shit don’t think you can apologize and make it better. I’m not a little bitch. I don’t NEED this. I want this. Big difference. https://t.co/2zGip8khfC
Jonathan take a seat, these aren’t fans these are entitled people who are being very demanding and rude I’m not a work horse plus I always speak my mind and then have people like YOU trying to tell me how to live my life. Don’t start w me, it’s in your best interest. https://t.co/34wwdQlk4g
They’re not. I’m in such an amazing place mentally, physically &amp; emotionally. I finally bought my first home 🏠 and I’m going to be proposing soon to my gf and we might just be expecting... 👸🏻🤴🏼 https://t.co/0IKfXtveYW
Apparently I’m the child...  I’ve literally toured the Ü.K more than any other country in the last four years and it’s never good enough. I’m shocked at how rude my so called fans are being. I’m trying to be as respectful as possible. But damn. Y’all better chill before I set 🔥 https://t.co/JQtcFOiBWB
Why is this so hard to understand? I’m not going to keep entertaining this negativity. Please stop ✋ https://t.co/lvB9v7oZUZ
My last two singles broke top 40 at ready. No one wants to talk about that though. They’d rather see me broke on drugs and failing at life. Good thing I turned all that around. 🙏🏻 https://t.co/g7900b6X5D
You’re not welcome at any of my shows. Take care. https://t.co/3wuaP53gA7
It never ends. What they can’t accept is I’m a real fucking dude. I’m not afraid of being human. https://t.co/m3IpyCFSIL
Leeeeeeave..... https://t.co/r9greGzC7T
A child? I’m a grown ass man. Who has never given up. I’ve raised myself. Have some respect. Oh FYI I could give a FUCK about a follow... I want REAL FANS not attention seekers. https://t.co/126Qk98P08
I appreciate that. I’m a hard mother fucking worker. I LOVE what I do. I never gave up on myself. It’s was alot of my fans that did when I had life struggles and they couldn’t accept that I’m human. I’m not perfect. https://t.co/hH7f3suLmx
I didn’t cancel ANYTHING the promoters postponed the shows NOT ME. my fans need to have more respect for me in the UK 🇬🇧 I’m a human being &amp; I’ve spent my whole life trying to make all you guys happy. It’s completely unfair. https://t.co/pvMV0ut8LS
Because the ticket sales weren’t good and promoters decided to reschedule. Are you happy now? By he way I’m unfollowing you and please don’t come to my shows when I do come to England. Thanks. https://t.co/0XsbI4L5MN
Thank you for continuing to believe in me after so many years. It feels great to be back. https://t.co/sG33J7cT9N
Why don’t you try losing everything and having the professional world turn their backs on you including your fans, gain their respect back and then never give up on yourself and get back at me. Maybe I’ll have some advice for you.
Listen man. I can’t sit here &amp; just not say anything to that, I’ve been in this industry before he was born. I’ve had harder times and always bounce back. No I’m not Justin Bieber I’m Aaron Carter. I’m also in construction 🚧 I paved the way. These kids have NEVER paid me homage. https://t.co/Qe86BI22Pq

So many people want to continue to tell me how to live my life, when looking back in retrospect ( I ) was able to rise from the ashes, do what I felt and accomplish more than what anyone thought I could whilst being slandered by random people and even my so called “fans”
https://t.co/GVdmZv8Y15

How many people grow up in an industry lose it all and get it back? I’ll tell you how.. hard work, focus, not letting people dictate your life, identifying with yourself, loving yourself, and cherishing the ones who believe in your talents ... my fans .. my REAL FANS. 😇
Proving people wrong is my favorite thing to do
I WILL flaunt my money I WILL show off my success and I WILL work hard.. and I have so many people who don’t want to see me back succeeding again and wealthy healthy and Inlove very sad
