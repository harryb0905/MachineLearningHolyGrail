Another clue just because I love my fans and followers:  Hubie Brown and Sidney Lowe are 2 of the 3
Here's the question again:  What were the 3 full names of my head coaches when I played in Memphis?
Here's a clue, Lionel Hollins is not an answer
not 1 winner yet. what's up guys? I thought you wanted a harder one
2 out of 3 doesn't count guys!
What were the 3 full names of my head coaches when I played in Memphis?
Now that we had a timezone lesson the question is coming in 5.....4.....3.....2....1..... LOL

@Crazy_Dave16 trust me, I did notice that! But had to be fair! Lol
LOL to some of the answers that included anything about chicken wings! You guys are funny
I think I actually stumped you guys w/ a harder one. Key words in the answer was "bay area chapter".
There are 2 organizations I work very close to.  What are the EXACT name of the 2?
Before anyone tries to yell at me about the answer for my ?, I'm telling you guys ahead of time that it has to have the correct wording.
