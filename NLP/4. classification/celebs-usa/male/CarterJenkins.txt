@messy4life I am. You?   Tor Miller show in December. See you there?
@Mikel_Jollett Wow, I’ve been following you for the top notch political commentary. Had no idea you’re the frontman of Airborne Toxic Event. I saw you perform on the main stage at Coachella in 2008, been on many of my playlists ever since.
@Titanium_22 @emosswilson 😂 🎯 (miss you both!)
@GussisLauren @insatiable_ Wow. Okay, sold. Watching. Thank you for sharing.
