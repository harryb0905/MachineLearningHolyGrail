@theyearofelan Fuck everyone’s suggestions and take the ferry to Lanai. Enjoy the whales on the way. At the top of the island, go to the poke store (they run out by 11) and the bakery- get the sweet cheese buns. You’re welcome.
@ericgarland There’s a Philadelphia at the southern border as well?
@theyearofelan I consider this advice a Christmas miracle

@ReneRedzepiNoma Yes please
I agree with and appreciate this Bill. But you left out one major point- THERE IS NO SHAME IN BAGGING GROCERIES. It’s more honest work than is currently being done at the highest reaches of our own government. https://t.co/s7wxNubJJi
@marcroberge Hahah
@seanoconnz Umm.
@jonhurwitz CORRECT ANSWER
@jonhurwitz Ugh just realized this was from last night. Goddam I hate twitters non sequential timeline

@kseelye @SamSifton Have to admit that going fishing for striped bass at 3am with Sam is super high on my bucket list
@chrisweitz WOW can’t wait
@AirlineFlyer @Airbus If you still have one of the A350s left I’ll take it thx
Agree with many of these choices. But how @plattypants makes this list without including Sushi Ginza Onodera is mind boggling to me. Argument can be made for Uchu and Noz and Kurumazushi as well. Sup? https://t.co/Ba9fbgLTkR

@Molly_Kats @MaraWilson That is a correct statement. However, it doesn’t change how one is supposed to call said roll. Taylor ham or bust.
@Molly_Kats @MaraWilson Sorry Mara, but I’m with Molly on this one. Although I can’t say I agree with their use of “pork” instead of the obviously correct “Taylor ham”.
