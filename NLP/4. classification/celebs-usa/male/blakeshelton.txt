#WhyMe. Texoma Shore Throwback Series. Coming every Thursday. - Team BS https://t.co/PI7tqnR6Gu https://t.co/vWH6dAN8Rc
Oh! And one more thing... There is a SHITLOAD of fake accounts out there claiming to be me. Be careful... Actually why the hell are we even on here anymore? Let's go live our lives!!!
@DanaEddy @Ali_Sweeney Yeah we made sure we color coordinated. You are welcome to investigate... Please. Be my guest.
@Ali_Sweeney Hey sis!!! Hope you're doing good!!!
Are you kidding me? I don't do politics no matter WHAT you've read about me and how it's been spun. And THATS the TRUTH from ME. And if you can find it in your heart to hate me for that then so be it. This is out of control...
(like I would try to do with anyone I meet who asks). Then we immediately left because it was too cold for the outdoor area we had reserved. And now according to the internet we were hanging out or having some big secret meeting in a PUBLIC restaurant!!!!!! WTF?!!!
I can't even fathom the gossip I read about myself anymore. Seriously.. Literally walked into a restaurant WITH MY FAMILY (including children, LOTS of children), bumped to a politician that I've never even met before, said hello and took pictures

What a truly devastating loss. I loved Mel. I will miss him terribly. My thoughts and prayers to all his family.
He did his best to try and keep my head on straight. I looked up to Mel more than he could've possibly known. A talented songwriter. An incredible entertainer. And a funny funny guy. It has been a couple years since I saw him last. I deeply regret that now.
He once spent an entire day at his place in Tennessee showing me all the memorabilia he'd gathered over the years where he gave me a pair of his stage boots. He even took time to talk me through some hard times in my life on a couple phone calls.
Some of my most cherished memories are the times I spent with Mel Tillis. Many many great memories. From fishing, to just having a beer, to him crashing my concert!
Good luck to my friend @Elliott_Sadler today!!!! Go get that championship buddy!!!
