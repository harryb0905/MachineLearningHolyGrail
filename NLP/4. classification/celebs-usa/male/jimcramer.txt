@B3_Millervalue: Bill you have been right on Amazon for ages and i agree with you about both the company and the stock!  It may be the Greatest of All Time! https://t.co/3B9P5dtqqn
Finally, i think that Apple's health initiatives are novel and potentially gigantic. Go read $JNJ's conference call yesterday and you will know what i mean. That's innovation!
However, i totally recognize that Amazon is the greater innovator of the era right now...That is no slag of Apple. Amazon is an amazing company...Both are good stocks...
Really puzzling over the innovation issue...The Twitter followers have spoken  pretty  much in unison against Apple. I am in steadfast disagreement. We benefit from its innovations everyday.

What a great piece from @EricJhonsa—no one else is doing this stuff. NO ONE! https://t.co/0RgQGmg6nK
The "Epic" idea has been shot down endlessly by people who don't understand my point--i want the system to work for the customer which is Apple's way...
Remember, my idea is to make it so the watch talks to the system. Keep thinking "Handshake" that's what is lacking and Apple can change that. This is not rocket science. I would pay $10 a month for a service that tells me i am a candidate for heart failure https://t.co/dkujKlvUPp
This is a classic issue--how can the government not insist that email is better than snail mail?  The patient has no ability to change this... https://t.co/IUCvtX9rVW
Health care systems do not talk to each other. That's like record labels before the I-pod. Jobs universalized music. Cook can universalize health records.. Epic should, theoretically want that if it really cared...
Apple wants a legacy of improving health care and to do that you need to have a "handshake" between the watch and "the system". You are thinking too  little of the customer and too much of Epic. https://t.co/9IfZO7QHGw

Let this economy continue to grow. We can find people to work. We are not having to pay them all that much. Why can't the workers make more money after a LOST decade.
earnings up 3.2% --oh really scary...
This is the kind of nonsense i see all of the time. I don't care about the market. I care about the working person.. Participation going up is good. https://t.co/YukoJpLm09
Again, this is why i favored the last hike.. not we want to see if things stay as strong as they are...  But we don't need the fed to say anything...
Big employment number. LAST big one ..
Mester is NOT focused on downside risk.. PLEASE, she wants to raise rates because inflation is going lower.  Hilarious if it weren't for the layoffs that are about to come  @JoeSquawk
Both ways--We need to wait, we need to move; we need to have two rate hikes because we are in a "good spot." What is a good spot?
@JoeSquawk is DEAD RIGHT.. Stay focused...
Mester to working people: you are doing too well.. We will bury you,
The deflation is so palpable. But your "in the good spot" rap is out of sync with the data.. One to two hikes? I give you a C; you are relying on Phillips Curve as if it is 1975. Go take new courses, Go west and see what is happening https://t.co/Nuw7Vgz6CZ
@BeckyQuick -is so right. You want one to two hikes and you see a slowdown happening? Is that rigor? is that sophisticated reasoning? And, again, i believe we will have a strong labor number
I would love to teach the fed how to do the job...
Apple isn't a canary. It's the actual suffocation writ large. I will not let up on the need for them to do better homework.  Whose homework was better in 2007, theirs or mine?
Maybe people don't tell the truth to the fed. Maybe the fed doesn't listen. You want to know what's really going on? Jeez you could watch Mad Money and know more that these people. Shameful
If you use Mester's homework you could have five rate hikes. That's how lacking in rigor her work is. Talk to ceos. Listen to the market.  Do some damn work. Optimistic? You talk to any of your bankers in your area?
I expect a good payroll number. I care about waiting to see if they stay strong. She may not want lay-offs but she will get them... is that something you want to be proud of?
She does  not agree with @JoeSquawk at all. PAIN. This is  so painful. Who are these people to be in charge of our economy. I want to be in that room. I am sick of these 2007 people. No reasoning with them ..
@JoeSquawk is so right: Calibrating? how about MAKING IT UP! Focus on data; get real world, stop being 2007 like  So painful. "good spot?" Then why ruin it?  Two hikes. Mester lacks RIGOR
Enough with the both ways--you either want to throw people out of work--the current formula--or you wait to see what happens.
I don't care if i am typecast as anyone. I am my own person and I DON'T PLAY FOR DINNER..  @JoeSquawk is so right. You don't do what she says if you want to keep the economy growing. Mester's all Phillips Curve.y https://t.co/HXJeOJpKC0
Cleveland Fed Mester--usual two-faced data dependent and more hikes. I don;t know a ceo who is "cautiously optimistic." DO THE HOMEWORK!!!

Rates "JUST BELOW" range of neutral. What a huge change. He did the work; he made the changes... Thank you Jay!
The Fed can use other tools besides rate increases. Just bring in the clowns and let them know it's game over!
Jay needs to crack down on the non-banks like Bernanke SHOULD have cracked down on the no-doc loans. Just haul them in and tell them to stick it.

Oh, and one more thing, perhaps the stock market is affirming my view and not others who think it is not a big deal. But now we have to worry about the tariffs.. So does Jay.. @ScottWapnerCNBC
I actually don't think there is any argument with @ScottWapnerCNBC unless you haven't done the homework or have some sort of weird bias
Hey, Jay's allowed to make rookie calls.. he made one.. The market plunged.. Now he's done the homework and he had to change his mind. @ScottWapnerCNBC
Powell made calls, recognized he may have been imprudent and rash and he's more judicious.  @ScottWapnerCNBC  Serious people like Scott get this
Blinking is the right thing... @ScottWapnerCNBC what he said on the third was rookie--this is more accurate. @HalftimeReport
People who know stocks know this is a big moment.. @ScottWapnerCNBC @HalftimeReport Thank heavens for Scott who has it DEAD RIGHT
Powell doesn't want to be the reason why we are at the end of the cycle...@ScottWapnerCNBC gets it--THE FED WASN'T BALANCED UNTIL TODAY FOR HEAVENS SAKE
@HalftimeReport the guys who say it is a big change and its because things are slower and one and wait is the issue. The market hasn't adjusted yet. POWELL BLINKED-- GIVE ME A BREAK!! Thanks @ScottWapnerCNBC
So glad fed did the work, made the calls and listened to... uh, well, me ..@ScottWapnerCNBC Now on to tariffs
Here's my thinking--they did more homework. They recognized the economy peaked in October and they don't want to put us at the end of the cycle....
So glad @Scottwapner got it dead right despite some protestations that he didn't.  Thank you Scott for acknowledging how much of a chance this is from the ill-advised Woodruff interview
Despite what you may hear--Powell blinked.. @ScottWapnerCNBC he took himself off the table as a reason for a longer bear market
Powell sees the global slowdown and knows that it could hurt us.  Powell is concerned and knows when he does one he has to wait-- very big change in view.
@ScottWapnerCNBC is right as rain as Powell gets it, enough is enough... and he has to be far more careful--

$FB fights back. Amazing that they still have the clout to influence the stock price.
Okay, what just happened. Let us in on the rally....We want to play, too

Heaven forbid a single hedge fund would be helpful in the process of trying to accumulate wealth
I tire of rich hedge fund managers telling you forget owning stocks, It is late cycle. Aging bull, 7th inning.. It's always the 7th inning with these guys.
it has become a forgone conclusion that FANG is dead.  I get that. But sorry if i want more than just bad charts. Charts are bad until they are good
i am inundated with materials that tell me that the FANG charts are all horrible and they are doomed. That's part and parcel with what i am talking about.

You know after what happened in 2007 i was taught by the fed to doubt my own sources. I vowed never to let that happen again.
Thanks @TheDomino , i a merely a reflection of what the ceos tell me... my sources are, alas, better than the Fed's... We cannot have themselves listen only to themselves.. We learned that in 2007. https://t.co/BO3ivQljbN

@TheDomino Thanks, Dom, for nailing what Jerome Powell really said last night in answer to Mr. Kaplan's questions.  I wanted him to show concern; that's just what he did!
Don't you love how the algos are now set to selling stocks when oil goes down or when Brexit has hiccups? Where are the real buyers or the real sellers. I will take anything real.

This is exactly how you get a powerful close. This one, beginning at 2:45 has a real nice rhythm beginning with the Vix 24 top and the ten to one. We go in the black at 3:30 and it is bingo
Too early? Yeah a little too early but i like the Vix 24 peak and the ten to one negative to positive ratio, I also like that it was indeed WRONG to sell as i said during @SquawkStreet  I just want this rally to slow here !
Love that VIX peak!
Jeez nice 2:45 p,m. Now if it can stay around here until 3;30 we could have a real run for the roses.
