The misinformation will feel unfair, but stay above it, trusting that other people will eventually see the truth, just like you did.
When a toxic person can no longer control you, they will try to control how others see you.
Pray hard!!
Discover your gift! Find your passion! Stop waiting around for life to change! Get up and change it yourself!
We will Stand on The Promise #ChangeNCAA

Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.
If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.  Succeed anyway.
Keep up the good work #givingback @ConnorBarwin98 http://t.co/QT6EAXxBIg
If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.  Do good anyway.
If you don't know check the next row!!
People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered. Love them anyway.

A boy may make an attempt if you’re lucky, but gives up before ever really trying.
A man knows a good woman when he meets one and will take initiative to get to know her.
A boy cares mostly only for girls who are hot, wild and exciting. #
A man looks for a woman with intelligence, who is supportive, grounded and encompasses a shared set of values when choosing a partner.
