@DeeSadz no just a guy from jersey wanting to talk about the state of affairs
How about some of the money from the ncaa profits from TV goes to pay professors and lower tuitions. What do they do with all that money?
What do yo think about Obama's student loan adjustments.  Guess you have 2 start somewhere. Need figure away 2 lower tuitions & pay teachers
@NerdyCow nice
@theCosmeable I get it.. lots of things to attend to. Just in a non violent way. Violence breeds.. more violence, the escalation of violence
@DavidsUniverse Citizens should be allowed to protest and assemble if no one pays attention soon then they'll be laying down in highways
@LuisSamuelMon  there's always the possibility of things getting dark I hope O can make a change without hurting kids on our soil. That's ng
