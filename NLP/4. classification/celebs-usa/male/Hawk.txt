@SunShine_726 Well Well Well, look who is a Browns fan!
@Matthew_Corn @pauldehnerjr True. But Ive had double digit concussions, &amp; had to do extensive research &amp; meet with specialists for over a year after having 6 months of effects after my last one. I can also read &amp; the info is available to  all humans. Its not like Im some shmuck from Unilever or something.
I say that to say, if concussed, he is no longer processing things with a sound mind. So you most definitely should not judge a player based on ANY decisions they make while their BRAIN IS INJURED. Which is why the decision to continue to play has been removed from the players.
Educational Thread: I get everything that surrounds Burfict &amp; his antics. BUT when you have a concussion, you ARE NO LONGER CLEAR thinking. Literally reacting on instincts &amp; possibly with no logically reasoning. For me, I would not even remember up to 10 hours AFTER I had them.. https://t.co/8Cc8yzBvVt

🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣 https://t.co/gsdfFMQ9KU
@danorlovsky7 Oooorrrrrrrrrrr....  We can just ask the Panthers GM to START doing both of those things, because theyre the only ones with an MVP QB who hasnt!!  I wonder if that could be why hes banged up 🤔🤔🤔.   Now stop replying mf’er I have to go to work!! lolol
@danorlovsky7 Of course they want him forever. Hes 2/3’s into the Dan Orvlosky Long gevity benchmark, lets see what happens.  Meanwhile, has a bad OL, average weapons, takes more hits &amp; rushes better than any QB ever, &amp; misses less games.  But sure, keep giving other Qbs the “tough” label
@danorlovsky7 Wentz’s career started yesterday &amp; Luck has ALREADY missed whole seasons, their debates are warranted.  Cam will be in season 9 within the next 3 games, and only missed 5 games (1 to an out of season car accident) and were talkin bout will he last? He HAS lasted.
@danorlovsky7 My POINT is even the most pedestrian of runners at QB have missed MORE games than Cam, so why are we debating if HE can last!?! 8 seasons in, only 3 games missed, were past that.   Because hes mobile youre stripping him of the ability to JUST GET HURT like everyone else.
@danorlovsky7 Games missed within fist 8 seasons as a starter.  Tom Brady - 15 Drew Brees - 7
@danorlovsky7 I guess Im more confused of what your considering “long term”. 8 seasons is Long to me. Averages say Even non-mobile QBs are going to miss considerable time at SOME point! Let alone a QB with  5000 yards and 58 TDs rushing.  At what season is it long enough? 10? 12?   .
@Mr4thAndLong 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@danorlovsky7 Wont argue getting hit more increass injury risk, but Cam is unlike any QB weve ever seen, so how can we make that determination based off others?  Games missed over course of Cams Career (2011):  Andrew Luck: 26  Aaron Rodgers: 17 Ben Roethlisburger: 11 Carson Wentz: 6 Cam: 3
I know for a FACT, my brother @Mr4thAndLong is a hater!! So if he says @DezBryant got something special cooking, I believe it! https://t.co/i6AR2EoqkY

Random.... but every time you see a player throw the ball into the stands, it costs them $5000.

@smartfootball @MichaelDavSmith @andydalton14 Am I safe to claim we brought it to the NFL? .... I really need this.

In the words of Jeff Garcia, "Jon Gruden likes to date players, not marry them"  Never commits to big talent (esp QBs) because big contracts are admitting they are good.  An admittance that they are good means he forfeits the "we need the right guy" excuse when team starts losing

Random....  Worst take ever: Browns need a coach that's going to be tough on them!  20 years of losing, and you genuinely dont think anybody has thought of that? 95% of the coaches that have coached in Cleveland have tried it. 100% of that 95% have failed.

@WillBlackmon In Shanahans offense they actually teach the opposite for that very reason!
Thats exactly what Im saying! The alternative is players signing "BIGGER" deals elsewhere and getting cut with 2-3 years of big money left on the deal. In the long run, because they generally honor the life of their contracts, you end up making more in Cincy  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ https://t.co/cGEaFsLWWh
Except in Cincinnati*   They usually sign their own guys to what are described as "Below market deals" , but players tend to play the majority of the deal out. Once the Brown family values at a price, they rarely second guess it. https://t.co/5CWX4lES27

There are almost always better deals in unrestricted free agency. That is fact. But, you asked if he realized what his value in unrestricted free agency would have been, &amp; I was merely answering your question. Which is Yes he did. https://t.co/rKNLGpUidO

@JoeGoodberry @AaronNagler @BrendanLeister @JoePong5 Could it be thrown &amp; tracked better? Always. Is the only rule of going inside on a fade that "u MUST immediately get back wide as possible because otherwise its the HARDEST throw in football?" EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. CAN be not a poor throw, not a drop, &amp; a should-be catch in 1 play
@JoeGoodberry @AaronNagler @BrendanLeister @JoePong5 My argument is that if you honestly look at that play and say its the Quarterback's fault, you either A. grudgingly have somethig against the QB, or B. Dont know as much football as your putting on. That should be a catch, and is not a poorly thrown ball.
@BrendanLeister @JoeGoodberry @JoePong5 Thats not a "crazy catch" and a fade ball should NOT be on upfield shoulder in cover 2. Thats how WRs get sent to the hostpital
@BrendanLeister @JoeGoodberry @JoePong5 No. Its cover 2. "Thats one of the hardest throws in football. And it gets 3x harder if the WR goes inside at the release, which you should never do. AJ can makes that catch in his sleep.
@JoeGoodberry @JoePong5 Please... enlighten me 😂🤣😂🤣

@JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 Understood. And im countering your counter with I think your stat is bogus.  &amp; Just because you have better tools, doesnt make you the better carpenter.    (I should put that on a tshirt lol)
@BrendanLeister @JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 Yes, but its a slippery slope when you start picking and choosing what generational factors you want to adjust. For example, the Top EAPR played at a time when 75% of the league wasnt even allowed to play if you catch my drift...
New ThomaHawk!!!!  Talk Hardknocks, LBJ and the Cavs, and fastfood draft! (Another win for Hawk if you ask me!)  @joethomas73 @ThomaHawkNFD   https://t.co/hAU7vx69X3
@JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 0.9* 🙄
@JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 BUT even if we did acknowledge it... Carsons EAPR is a 69.1 and Andy's is a 68.2 ..... so you would literally have to only take that minuscule 1.0 difference from a simulated and subjected stat in complete isolation and not consider ANY OTHER factor to prove your case right.
@JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 Lol Yes we have. &amp; Fake news is my take. By that simulated and  subjected statistic, Tom Brady is the 13th best QB in NFL history, Tony Romo is #17 &amp; better than Drew Brees &amp; Big Ben, Jeff Garcia is better than Brett Farve, kirk cousins is better than warren moon, Elway, &amp; Aikman
@JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 I  dont know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯....  .. but for starters, Win, make playoff appearances, be durable, throw more yards, throw more touchdowns, throw fewer interceptions, make more pro bowls, have better QB rating, rush for 10x as many yards, rush 3x as many TDs (im running out of spa
@JoeGoodberry @danorlovsky7 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Sexier? Meh. Better? No. At BEST, equal.

Well thats the caveat. If they are 2-13, 1-10, 3-9 ..... then yes, Baker era starts..  BUT  My point is, I dont see them in that position with Tyrod and this roster. ... even at 5-5 (which is a huge improvement), I think Tyrod is STILL the QB for the remainder of 2018 https://t.co/EIpDDS1ivJ

@danorlovsky7 Preaching to the choir. #1 overall, thats your guy. All Im saying is, sucks to be Tyrod in a world of  Brock Osweilers
@danorlovsky7 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@danorlovsky7 Theres only three QBs with more than 50 TD passes and under 20 ints in that span.  Total Tds:  Tom Brady:   99 TDs &amp; 17 ints Alex Smith:   69 TDs &amp; 20 ints Tyrod Taylor: 65 TDs to 16 ints https://t.co/MHhzgp1Dt8
@danorlovsky7 And yes, its relative because in Cleveland, if the QB went 18 total TDs to 4 ints in each of the last 13 seasons. they would have been a playoff contender every year.
@danorlovsky7 The better analogy (and can't believe we're here right now Dan lololol) would be divorcing the abusive husband and then staying with the second husband even though you've developed a thing for the mailman.
@danorlovsky7 Disagreed, both of those scenarios are bad. My point is I don't think 18 total TDs (14 pass) to 4 ints is bad AT ALL.
@danorlovsky7 Also, for shits and gigs...  QBs since CLE's playoff drought began in 2003 i think..  QBs who pass for  14 TDs &amp; less than 10 picks in a season = 0  Qbs with 18 total TDs = 1  QBs with 14 passing TDs under 14 picks = 2  Qbs with 14 td passes in a season = 3
@danorlovsky7 And in the last three seasons, hes 65 total TDs to 16 picks. List out the QBs who match that, and you'll notice something...
@danorlovsky7 I hear you ... &amp; I get 14 TDs isnt sexy, but the # of QBs between BUF &amp; CLE in the last 20 years (40 total seasons of football) that have passed for 14+ TDs and less than 5 ints is Zero. And he also rushed for 4. So, QBs with 18 total tds and less than 5 picks is also zero.
@TheRealJMorgan Lol well aware... i had "i get thats a big what if" in the tweet, but ran out of characters
Im as excited as anyone about Baker Money May, BUT..  If the Browns sit him a year for Tyrod, who I think is a GOOD undervalued QB..  &amp; Tyrod takes them to the playoffs..  What next?  Imagine taking BUF &amp; CLE to the playoffs back 2 back years &amp; still being questioned as a starter
Im way to excited about Baker... https://t.co/M7ObDVvEtz

Question.  Shorter or lighter players' scouting reports always say "Lacks NFL Size." &amp; Since  hundreds of players at those sizes have had effective NFL careers, I imagine it actually means "not ideal size for NFL Player"..

Absolutely. Lol, but hopefully he and his agent have something in the contract to prevent it. https://t.co/1ugoydoJdA
I would never. If something happens (trouble, retirement, etc) during the course of his contract, Smith would owe the Jags the pro-rated amount of that bonus back  If he kept it a roster bonus, soon as the first game of 2018 comes, its his forever and ever and ever and ever and. https://t.co/jxAkddwWXL

Taylor Gabriel expected to sign with the Chicago Bears on a 4 year deal. per source.   Taylor Gabriel is my source.  #ThomaHawk
Was against Kirk going to Vikings. but a fully guaranteed contract is a GAME CHANGER! wowzers. https://t.co/LHUMwun6qo
@JackDuffin Very true!!
@JackDuffin Yes, and here we have Drew, who did the same thing, got no extra rings, and is about to get pushed out of the franchise. #PatriotsCommittedToTomWhenTheyTradedJimmy
@RSherman_25 @joethomas73 I agree with Sherm. 30 years old end of the month, coming off of major achilles injury (at the CB position where achilles are most used). Don't believe an agent would have gotten any better multi-year deal done under circumstances. If youre down, lets discuss on #ThomaHawk Sherm
Those are the ones! https://t.co/GfV52sovKv

No exaggeration, the last time I worked out was at my last Patriots mini camp practice. https://t.co/CPU1LiBg7t
Nope, but regardless, he wont play forever.  So whether he retires tomorrow or for 2 more seasons, you NEED. A Tackle. https://t.co/f9L1IIijQm
Give up!?!? Corey Coleman has JUICE!! This gives the WR core the ability to take pressure off eachother ... between the four, they can all focus on what they are great at, woth no pressure to have to do EVERYTHING https://t.co/GGizBWwF2V
Perfect World for me:  Free Agents:  CB Richard Sherman QB Case Keenum/AJ Mccarron WR Terrelle Pryor ST Johnson Bademosi   Draft: #1 Barkley  # 4 Mayfield #33 Left Tackle (most you have is 2 years in Joe T) https://t.co/Q6yT9eqj7F
Better* https://t.co/2j7nNtb35R
Less than 1% chance Browns get Kirk. But, other vet options out there with high upside and good bridge til a young QB draft pick is ready. https://t.co/hZDAn6HQH1
I dont think there is a WR (maybe even a player) that plays harder than @God_Son80 . And I mean that 100% https://t.co/HXvWlRE8Mf

The really bad part about this is that the Colts are going to have to scramble and probably make a TERRIBLE head coach hire.
Either...  1. McDaniels is NE Head coach in waiting  2. Andrew Luck basically had his shoulder amputated  3. Jim Irsay accidently saved him in his phone as "Stormy Daniels" &amp; sent him the wrong text.... https://t.co/c9N3nbCqn8

@MichaelDavSmith Oh ok! I 100% agree having "faith in God " doesnt ensure victory, superior ability, or best case outcome. Thats ridiculous. But I dont see how any1 who isnt Nick Foles can say his perceived power of faith had no affect on his performance, if he says thats what gave him confidence
@MichaelDavSmith what i mean...  Do you believe in the power of having self- confidence? Do you believe in the power of love?  Do you believe that ANYTHING that is not tangible can be a driving force at all?
@MichaelDavSmith I get what you mean, &amp; even as a Christian, I can agree that either instance (ali/foles) is proof that there is a God.   But your logic behind "no power in faith" goes wayyyy beyond religion. That would essentially mean there is no power in anything.
I remember our first time hittin 8.6 milly @joethomas73 . Newbies.... #ThomaHawk https://t.co/yeefi6cC4T

This is 100% a fake quote. I thought that would be clear lol. https://t.co/nOyohHwdke
We talk about this on the #ThomaHawk show! https://t.co/hHE7ajrWyk
Jeff Fisher: "I mean lets keep it all the way funky. I was responsible for signing &amp; drafting this years Offensive player of the year (Todd Gurley), Defensive player of the year (Aaron Donald), and the Super Bowl MVP (Nick Foles). I should be the 2017 coach of the year." https://t.co/6ObuaAqWtg
Heavy heart today as we lost another brother in our NFL family.   Edwin Jackson &amp; I did an internship together through the @NFLPA at @UnderArmour headquarters.   He was so impressive and Was destined for greatness on &amp; off the field!  Rest in Peace my friend. You will be missed! https://t.co/fyFBqUjwi1
I WAS SO DAMN WRONG! Playing that big in the biggest games aint luck! As a player, I hated media who would talk **** but never acknowledge when they were wrong on it. I dont want applause for being wrong, just making it clear Im not those #%¥@s! Congrats @NFoles_9! Youre a Champ!
Also, I have been EXTREMELY hard on Nick Foles since he took over. From the Start I thought there was NO WAY hed be successful. Anyone who asked me, I shared that opinion. &amp; every week that he did great, I was just waiting for the clock to strike midnight on the cinderella story.
😔 I picked Patriots. I was wrong. &amp; I owe @BustaRhymes 100,000 bitcoin. He gotta find me 1st ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   But congrats to all my boys on the Eagles!! Yall defied the odds &amp; deserve it all!  @MalcolmJenkins @nelsonagholor @JOEL9ONE @TorreySmithWR @sheltongibson @DarrenSproles
