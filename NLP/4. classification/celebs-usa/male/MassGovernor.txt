We are confident that the increased communication and coordinated police work this pilot program supports will lead to safer communities and less fentanyl on our streets, and we urge the Legislature to promptly enact the supplemental budget bill.
Too often dealers can evade authorities by moving to another nearby location in a different city or town. With the change in legislative session last month, we have now included this critical funding in a supplemental budget bill recently filed with the Legislature.
In response to this very serious challenge posed by the presence of #fentanyl across Massachusetts, last October we filed legislation seeking $5 million to support a regional, multi-agency approach to fentanyl interdiction and crime displacement by municipal police departments. https://t.co/xstunD6tam
Fentanyl and the drug dealers who sell it continue to be fueling factors in the deadly heroin and opioid epidemic. Though opioid-related overdose deaths were down 4% last year over 2017, #fentanyl was present in the toxicology of 89% of those who lost their lives. #opioidcrisis https://t.co/2TgfCjZIzd
We look forward to increasing the number of children entering kindergarten ready to succeed with the help of this grant and the work it supports.

In addition, we are eager to move forward with the Administration‚Äôs proposal to strengthen the hand of law enforcement by providing $5 million to support a new Regional Fentanyl Interdiction Task Force (originally filed last October https://t.co/46X6FQwvaF).
We look forward to working with our colleagues in the Legislature to continue ramping up the Commonwealth's funding for prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery services in the FY20 budget.  @MassDPH press release: https://t.co/s6L1JaPUYn
While we are encouraged to see fewer opioid-related overdose deaths for a 2nd consecutive year and a 35% decrease in reported opioid prescriptions since 2015, the #OpioidEpidemic continues to present a serious challenge that is made more difficult due to the presence of fentanyl. https://t.co/N9LPB7j9Ab

‚ÄúWe understand the science and know the impacts are real because we are experiencing them first-hand.‚Äù  üé• Gov. Baker testifies before the House Natural Resources Committee to discuss what Massachusetts is doing to address #climatechange. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/BqSXudVNju
Governors around the country are seeing and responding to the effects of climate change. This is not a challenge any one of us can solve alone; we need collective action from federal, state and local governments, working with the private sector, to #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/59g2RSHUkm
Fourth, the federal government should incorporate climate risk and resilience in future federal spending and planning decisions to ensure taxpayer dollars are used wisely. Our own Boston Harbor Islands are already threatened by sea level rise and storm surge. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/kpQ7kjgH7p
Third, strong federal leadership should also include bringing its resources to bear on developing the next breakthrough battery cell or other technological advances that could help dramatically reduce emissions and radically transform our energy future. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/zE3OR1blUM
Second, we need strong federal leadership + bold bipartisan vision that prioritizes practical, market-driven + cost-effective solutions, while affording states flexibility. It's essential to establish federal targets for emissions reductions, varied by state/region. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/qLkoxgzeUB
Both state and federal governments also need to develop public-private partnerships to bring private-sector dollars into our communities while leveraging the knowledge and strategic thinking the private sector can bring to this challenge. #ActOnClimate
Bipartisan interest in infrastructure funding also holds tremendous promise. Any federal infrastructure legislation should incorporate consideration of #climatechange emissions, vulnerability, and design standards that reflect a changing climate. #ActOnClimate
First, states and local communities need support from the federal government. Many federal incentives are only available after a disaster occurs; incentives similar to our MVP program would help communities address resiliency issues before the next disaster. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/zDZdRkwFOu
Based on our experience in Massachusetts, I would like to share four themes I believe will help further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase resiliency across the country. #ActOnClimate
Our administration has also sought to work closely with cities + towns. Our Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program provides grants and technical assistance to municipalities to assess their vulnerabilities, and plan for + implement climate adaptation projects. #ActOnClimate
Leveraging @fema funds, we've recently completed a State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan, the first in the nation to fully integrate federal hazard mitigation planning requirements, with a proactive approach to addressing the impacts of #climatechange. #ActOnClimate
In 2016, we competitively-bid + selected an #offshorewind project on a federal lease area that will save ratepayers money. I applaud Congress for providing a predictable tax credit, and also the Trump Administration‚Äôs @BOEM_DOI for working with us on a quick review. #ActOnClimate
We have also developed regional partnerships with New England states, the Canadian provinces and the federal government. Utilizing the comparative strengths of different regions allows us to obtain competitive pricing on projects like hydropower from Quebec. #ActOnClimate
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative also provides a stable policy to reduce emissions + allows states to invest in cost-effective #energyefficiency programs. The investments from this initiative have saved ratepayers across RGGI states an estimated $8.6 billion. #ActOnClimate
Massachusetts, via bipartisan legislation, was one of the first states to establish a long-term requirement to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. We are well on our way to reaching our 2020 goal of a 25% reduction in emissions. #ActOnClimate
The magnitude of the impacts from #climatechange requires all of us ‚Äì at the federal, state and local levels - to put politics aside and work together. That is the path we have taken in Massachusetts. #ActOnClimate https://t.co/GnxLYy5YIV

We also look forward to working with our community colleges + state universities to implement a program to give students a stable place to live so they can thrive academically + access the necessary supports in their own communities to help them on their path to self-sufficiency.
Today, we're pleased to announce that 10 community agencies are receiving more than $3 million to help us implement the plan on the front lines, addressing youth + young adult homelessness in a variety of ways targeted to meet the demographic + geographic needs of each region.
Our FY19 budget included historic funding to address youth homelessness at $3.3 million, up from $675,000 in FY18, and our FY20 budget proposal maintains that funding to continue to implement a coordinated, statewide system to prevent more young people from experiencing crises.
Our Administration has taken a targeted and intentional approach to addressing #homelessness in the Commonwealth which includes expanding access to affordable housing, enhancing community supports, strengthening employment opportunities and investing in transportation.
Youth #homelessness in Massachusetts is an issue we can solve. By intervening early in a young person‚Äôs life and connecting them to supports and resources within the community, we provide the structure for young people to thrive. https://t.co/GpnvyYUTjA https://t.co/3DuPcosxWs

The enduring value of our homes and businesses, whether urban, suburban, or rural, are tied implicitly to the safety and sustainability of our communities. Proactive investments made now will help to avoid higher costs later as climate impacts continue. #MassMuni19
This will amount to $75 million in FY20 and $137 million on an ongoing, annualized basis, for the Global Warming Solutions Trust Fund. This funding will be made available to cities and towns to invest in climate-smart infrastructure that protects public health, safety + property.
We are proposing as part of our budget package a modest increase in the excise on real estate transfers to fund a substantial and sustained investment to protect MA residents, communities, economy, and infrastructure from the adverse effects of #climatechange. #MassMuni19
But our work is not done and it has been clear that #climatechange is a challenge of historic scale that will require strategic investments in planning, resilient infrastructure upgrades, and other innovative adaptation strategies in communities all across the state. #MassMuni19
One area where the need to support our communities has become evident and urgent over the last four years is climate resiliency. Since coming into office, our administration has spent more than $600 million on mitigating + preparing for the effects of #climatechange. #MassMuni19

Expanding Massachusetts‚Äô developing #gaming industry to include wagering on professional sports is an opportunity for Massachusetts to invest in local aid while remaining competitive with many other states pursuing similar regulations.  üîó: https://t.co/LULRGdlDiB https://t.co/OItQ10a2Cx
Grateful for the opportunity to attend as @MassAGO, @MassTreasury, @MassAuditor + @SecretaryOfMass took the oaths of office today for new terms. The people of the Commonwealth are well served by the partnerships that exist across state government.

Today, Governor Charlie Baker appointed Cathy Judd-Stein, who has served as a legal advisor to five Massachusetts Governors, as the Chair of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.   üîó: https://t.co/Narz3ZDVqw https://t.co/rUA1COjyG2
TODAY: Governor Baker re-filed legislation to provide law enforcement and the courts with additional tools to ensure dangerous criminals are held in custody pending trial.   üîó: https://t.co/heQVCwHckq https://t.co/BOLqhelGUg
Cathy's experience in state government and incredible diligence + attention to detail are some of the many attributes that qualify her to be the Chair. We thank Cathy for her contributions to our administration and look forward to her taking on this critically important position.
Cathy is highly regarded not only here on Beacon Hill, but throughout the legal community for her expertise on a wide variety of legal issues, most notably the laws governing the ethics and conduct of public employees.
Today, I am proud to appoint Cathy Judd-Stein as the new chair the @MassGamingComm. Cathy has built an impressive legal career over the last several decades, providing sound guidance on state law and public policy to 5 separate Massachusetts governors. https://t.co/Narz3ZDVqw https://t.co/vaVEmUW9DQ
The goal of this bill is to close loopholes at the start and end of the criminal process. It will provide more tools for prosecutors and law enforcement, and empower the judicial system to more informed decisions about the release of dangerous individuals. https://t.co/heQVCwHckq https://t.co/HHlxekJEfA
For our criminal justice laws to be effective, they must be current and applicable to the challenge that judges, law enforcement and prosecutors face every day in their pursuit to keep our communities safe.
Our administration has worked with the law enforcement community, district attorneys, and victims advocacy groups to identify several areas where the Commonwealth's laws can be improved pertaining to pretrial release and dangerousness statues. https://t.co/heQVCwHckq
When our criminal justice system fails to I.D. and detain dangerous people who've committed serious crimes, our communities suffer. Statutes concerning pretrial release don‚Äôt currently give our judicial system the full range of tools that could keep these people off our streets.
In my inaugural address, I spoke about how keeping our communities safe from dangerous people is a fundamental responsibility of government. We take that very seriously and today I am re-filing our bill on dangerousness, making it the first legislative proposal of our new term. https://t.co/I7xfAFPzBS
We look forward to helping lead this new frontier for American energy and establishing a hub for #offshorewind development on the East Coast through continued collaboration with @MHIVestas and the rest of the offshore wind industry. https://t.co/nykUncRNRL https://t.co/DpU7Z04Sge
Our Administration was proud to secure the largest single US procurement of #offshorewind, and @MHIVestas' selection of Massachusetts for its North American HQ is one of a series of initial steps that will support the state remaining a national leader for this emerging industry. https://t.co/rMHq28GOzM
I am thankful to the Legislature for working with our administration to pass a version of this bill that assists consumers while allowing state agencies to perform their statutory responsibilities and comply with state and federal law.
The improvements made to Massachusetts laws in this legislation are necessary to protect consumers from the consequences of #databreaches that could expose personal information and to give consumers more control over their data and how it is used. #DataSecurity https://t.co/DgSQilNNzs

Over the last four years, @MassLtGov and I have heard from our residents that the way we all work together is a model for the nation. People like our collaborative approach to governing. They say they‚Äôre proud to be from Massachusetts. And so am I. #MovingMAForward
These days, too much of what pretends to be debate is just rhetoric or character assassination. And every time someone joins that chorus they steal time, attention and focus away from finding common ground, creating solutions and doing the work that matters. #MovingMAForward
Each day, the wheels of government turn, and when they turn well, they build strong communities, support great schools, grow the economy, clean up the environment, promote justice, and give people a chance. The wheels create hope, opportunity and possibility. #MovingMAForward
It‚Äôs in moments like the Merrimack Valley explosions that everyone remembers why committed and creative public service matters. At the same time, the day to day work goes on without much notice. #MovingMAForward
On opioid addiction we‚Äôve made great progress, though more work remains. Not all that long ago, families, providers, and first responders had virtually no hope. Today, we‚Äôre one of a handful of states that can say that overdose deaths have dropped since 2017. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/uYxT0BiBQb
Later this year we will file legislation to address these issues by expanding the use of telemedicine, rethinking some of our scope of practice guidelines, and dealing with the parity issues that have negatively affected those dealing with mental health issues. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/HWOL0SNM8a
Small businesses in Massachusetts have among the highest health insurance costs in the country. The price for the same medical service can vary by as much as 300% depending on where it‚Äôs provided. Our community hospitals continue to struggle. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/NSgg500h60
Our health care cluster is a wonder, economically and clinically. It‚Äôs constantly delivering solutions to some of the most urgent and challenging problems facing patients and their families. The flip side is the price we pay. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/dLk09YtaXt
We owe it to Sergeants Gannon and Chesna, Officer Tarentino, Trooper Clardy, their brothers and sisters in law enforcement, and to our citizens to ensure that we‚Äôre doing all we can to keep dangerous people off of our streets. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/ka0xqlTpHQ
On criminal justice, our work is not done. Too often, dangerous career criminals are arrested only to be released as soon as they appear in court. This sort of revolving door serves to undermine people‚Äôs faith in law enforcement and the courts, and it‚Äôs a threat to public safety. https://t.co/Q7jhKQRtSV
Building a stronger, more equitable, more resilient and more successful Commonwealth rests on several pillars. But one of the most important ones is delivering a big increase in housing production. We need to get this done. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/0rrPiROO3w
I believe that our housing bill was a strong step in the right direction to deal with the housing crisis. In the end, it failed because it was too much for some and not enough for others. We shouldn‚Äôt let the perfect become the enemy of the good. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/JsoXQGNWNV
We also need to more fully appreciate the relationship between where people live and where they work, and how state and local government policies affect their ability to get from one to the other. #MovingMAForward https://t.co/rh1UBVEt0F

All told, the #MBTA is investing nearly $2 billion into improving the #RedLine and #OrangeLine, which includes the signal upgrades, fully replacing both fleets with cars built in Springfield, rebuilding and modernizing maintenance facilities, and making track improvements. https://t.co/8jjNAEyaws
And recently, in October, the #MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board awarded a $218 million contract to upgrade and modernize the signal systems on the #RedLine and #OrangeLine. These upgrades are expected to substantially improve service reliability. https://t.co/nkDSk5JqSS
The impressive @CRRCMACorp facility in Springfield employs nearly 150 women and men assembling both #OrangeLine and eventually #RedLine cars, is spurring growth in the region and workforce, and will help deliver reliability for customers of the #MBTA and other transit agencies. https://t.co/QpNUajDS6m
For the past few years, a lot of work to turn around the #MBTA has gone on behind the scenes, and today we can see physical results of these efforts in the form of the first two new #OrangeLine vehicles produced right here in Springfield, Massachusetts. https://t.co/xXbwd5Q3u4

.@MassLtGov and I would like to thank Joe Albanese for his critical contributions to execute this creative recovery process and we look forward to his continued work to help people get back to normalcy.
As we transition to the next phase of this project, we expect Columbia Gas to keep working with the Mayor and Town Managers on every aspect of this operation to support the residents who were put in this dire situation by no fault of their own.
For many families, the last 3 months have contained their darkest hours. The sadness, frustration and disruption of this incident is unparalleled. But the spirit and resiliency of this region has been a bright spot. People across the state have demonstrated overwhelming kindness.
While this is a significant milestone, this is not ‚Äòmission accomplished.‚Äô There is still a tremendous amount of work to be done to make residents whole and return normalcy to their lives. Our administration and local officials will continue to hold Columbia Gas accountable.
This creative recovery process has been taxing, and much work remains, but a quick run through of the numbers makes it clear that an extraordinary amount of work has occurred in a tight timeframe. https://t.co/ePUIyd5rvb
Columbia Gas has substantially completed the critical project of restoring heat and hot water to 98 percent of the homes and businesses impacted by the natural gas outages, with the remaining customers choosing to do their work independently or have extenuating circumstances.

Another great advantage is for the Commonwealth‚Äôs farmers, who can bring their fresh produce right here to this distribution center instead of to each individual store. This next expansion will streamline that process even more, getting the farmers back to their farms quicker.
Their next expansion is in the works and will improve the efficiency of the flow of goods to all of their stores, accommodating the next 20 years of growth and include 152k sq ft of additional dry storage, 82k sq ft of specialized refrigerated storage, and another 32 employees!
In 1995, when @bigyfoods expanded its distribution center in Springfield, a staff of 27 people distributed produce and other products to their 31 supermarkets.   Today, this 189,000 square foot distribution center operates 24/7 with a staff of 92 supporting 70 supermarkets. https://t.co/9Py2UqsEUt

We are extremely fortunate to have someone with his leadership and level of experience willing to lead this secretariat and continue so much of the great work Secretary Bennett has done to keep Massachusetts a safe and great place to live.

For the first time in history, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer received full NAME accreditation under Dan‚Äôs leadership, and he has worked with the State Police to implement a number of reforms, including the elimination of Troop E + the activation of GPS tech in cruisers.
Dan has been a tireless advocate for combatting the opioid epidemic across Massachusetts, instrumental in passing reforms to empower police officers to crack down on fentanyl and carfentanil traffickers and deploying an innovative buyer diversion treatment program.
Working in this secretariat surrounded by law enforcement and emergency responders takes grit, which Secretary Bennett undoubtedly has, but what the people of the Commonwealth may not have always seen so obviously is Dan‚Äôs deep compassion and collaborative work ethic.

We are seeing progress against this opioid epidemic ‚Äî MA is one of only 8 states where opioid overdose deaths are decreasing, according to the CDC ‚Äî but we still need our law enforcement to come down hard on those trafficking fentanyl.

This program will support a regional, multi-agency approach to fentanyl interdiction and crime displacement by local police departments, and funding will help supplement surveillance work + OT costs for units engaged and officers in the field working to get buyers into treatment.
The presence of fentanyl in overdose deaths rose to nearly 90% this year, and today, I was joined by police chiefs and officers who represent those on the front lines of this epidemic to announce legislation seeking $5 million for a Fentanyl Interdiction Pilot Program.

Introducing more students to the possibilities #STEM offers is critical to the future of the Commonwealth. It is crucial that all students have the ability to gather information, make sense of that information, think critically and solve tough problems. #MassSTEMWeek https://t.co/iX5P1DupTY
Despite the abundance of jobs in #STEM fields, just 1 in 6 high school seniors say they are interested in studying STEM in college. For Massachusetts ‚Äì which has the most technology jobs per capita in the country ‚Äì this creates both economic and societal challenges. #MassSTEMWeek https://t.co/wNPaq61iiP
Knowledge in #STEM subjects is increasingly important to all of us ‚Äì not just people in lab coats or someone writing code. STEM innovations permeate all aspects of our lives; impact work in almost every profession; and are rapidly changing the way we live. #MassSTEMWeek
I was pleased to be at @DearbornSTEM with @MassLtGov, @RepJoeKennedy, @VertexPharma CEO and President Jeff Leiden, and most importantly students and educators to kickoff the inaugural #MassSTEMWeek. More than 500 #STEM events are being held across the Commonwealth this week. https://t.co/LLATN8EPlr

$200k of this new funding will be invested here at @TheHelpline to launch a public awareness campaign, and another portion will build on our commitment to providing Medication-Assisted Treatment to incarcerated individuals + connecting them to treatment providers upon release.
We are also highlighting the $36 million in new federal funding Massachusetts received last month to build on the state‚Äôs intervention, prevention, treatment, and recovery strategies, bringing the total amount of federal funding in Massachusetts to nearly $60 million since 2017.
In June, we also announced $1 million to 33 local police and fire departments to purchase naloxone, something we‚Äôve been doing since December 2015, at a discounted rate through what is known as the Municipal Naloxone Bulk Purchasing Program. https://t.co/xqewh8vZIK https://t.co/P6qPvQt50J
There‚Äôs still work ahead, and today we are removing barriers for individuals accessing naloxone at pharmacies thanks to recent legislation. A prescription will not be needed for any person at risk of an opioid-related overdose or their family members, and insurers must cover it. https://t.co/3XVU1T8YBz
However, the presence of fentanyl in overdose deaths hit an all-time high this year at nearly 90%. We are working with the law enforcement community to take a hard line approach to arresting individuals responsible for the spread of fentanyl in Massachusetts and New England.
We've seen some progress to bend the trend in the right direction using every tool we can in our toolbox:  &gt; Opioid-related overdoses deaths were down 4% from 2016 to 2017.   &gt; Opioid prescriptions have declined 30% since the introduction of our prescription monitoring program. https://t.co/LvYAs2fTq5
Since 2015, we‚Äôve taken + continue to take bold steps to reduce the number of overdose deaths, including doubling funding for addiction treatment, adding 1,200+ treatment beds, implementing the nations first 7-day limit on new prescriptions, and training 8,500 future prescribers. https://t.co/Y0iH3MSi36

Since 2015, we've significantly increased our #behavioralhealth treatment capacity, and committed over $1.9B in behavioral health care investments over the next 5 years. But there‚Äôs a long way to go to achieve parity for behavioral health care similar to physical health care.
We have fully supported women‚Äôs access to reproductive health care and family planning services. I‚Äôve been proud to sign bi-partisan legislation protecting access to contraception coverage, as well as repealing archaic provisions to ensure a woman‚Äôs right to her own decisions.
Two tools launched this year by @Mass_CHIA, including a #healthcare transparency website called CompareCare (https://t.co/gn3mbbDHZ9), are truly game changing steps that have positioned Massachusetts as the undisputed national leader in health care price transparency.
I‚Äôm proud of the work we‚Äôve done to turn around the @HealthConnector. We're ready to launch open enrollment on Nov. 1st with a functional and steady Connector‚Äìa very different picture than when we took office. A backlog of 900+ urgent cases in Jan. 2015 was just 23 in September.
Pleased to help @Mass_HPC kick off this year‚Äôs #CTH18. Massachusetts remains the healthiest state in the nation, with an extremely low percentage of uninsured individuals, low obesity rates, and high vaccination rates, but we also continue to be one of the most expensive. https://t.co/wFvE9gZfry

With the Berkshire Innovation Center, Pittsfield + the #Berkshires are part of the message that Massachusetts is sending both nationally + globally that the Commonwealth is serious about supporting the public-private partnerships that will lead to continued growth + advancement.
We believe that investment in the future of the #lifesciences throughout MA is critical to maintaining our vitality and competitiveness, and I was proud to sign legislation that over the next 5 years will continue to support #lifescience education, R&amp;D and workforce training.
As an Administration, we're incredibly proud of our commitment towards ensuring that the benefits of our thriving #lifesciences industry are experienced throughout Massachusetts. Our investment in the BIC aims to expand the capabilities + capacity of this region‚Äôs entrepreneurs.
We are here #InTheBerkshires to break ground on a new era for the #lifesciences sector in Western Massachusetts. The Berkshire Innovation Center in Pittsfield will draw new jobs, training, and opportunities for the people who live here. #WMass https://t.co/IHjNvaFmer https://t.co/0Dv8HbZWDa

Targeting community college students for increased financial aid increases the likelihood they will graduate on time, with a degree or credential needed to continue their education at a four-year institution or get a good paying job. #highered   üîó: https://t.co/JMz8MMsRjK
These #scholarships are for full and part-time #communitycollege students. Previously, part-time students were not eligible for MassGrant financial aid scholarships, despite representing 63% of all community college students.
Our budget increased college scholarship funding by $7.5M ‚Äì so all #communitycollege students who qualify for Pell Grants, will have their remaining tuitions and fees fully covered. This is the largest increase to the state‚Äôs MassGrant financial aid program in almost two decades. https://t.co/rdDhnrK1jt
One of the biggest reasons students don‚Äôt finish #communitycollege is because ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt make the math work‚Äù, despite Pell grants, Mass Grants, etc., and that was why we expanded access to last-dollar scholarships for low-income students to cover remaining tuition and fees. https://t.co/woEfImuaGL
I especially want to thank @danrivera01843, @Town_Mgr_Maylor + @AndrewPFlanagan for their leadership throughout this crisis. This entire recovery effort has been a reminder of the importance of strong bonds between state and local governments, as well as neighboring communities.
I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time in the Merrimack Valley over the past week and a half and seen firsthand the outstanding job the teams on the ground have done to help these communities recover. I want to thank everyone for their generosity and support as we continue to rebuild.
We look forward to working together with the cities and towns across the Commonwealth who are leading the way on these issues to implement and continually update this plan, and to developing and implementing climate plans and hazard mitigation plans at the local level.
The plan outlines 100+ initial adaptation and hazard mitigation actions state agencies and executive offices have identified to increase statewide resiliency, and the $2.4B bond bill I signed last month allocates $100M dollars over 5 years towards implementation.
I was excited to announce the release of our State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan, which will help our communities better plan and prepare for #ClimateChange impacts. This innovative plan uses the best available science + data to examine risk + plan for the future.
Great start to the day with a room full of municipal officials responsible for the delivery of many core services to the residents of Massachusetts. Got to speak to our commitment to providing independence, flexibility + common sense when it comes to the state-local partnership. https://t.co/k7Z9IoVMVh

While the short term mitigation plan is underway and assessments are being done, Columbia Gas has mapped out a long term construction process to rebuild and replace the gas pipeline impacted by this event.  üîó to @ColumbiaGasMA press release: https://t.co/xy8DZtByqR
Residents should note that when teams arrive at your homes, they will have an ID card - a white badge stating that they are an ‚ÄúAuthorized Visitor for Columbia Gas of Massachusetts.‚Äù If you have questions or concerns about teams arriving at your home, please call 866-388-3239.
This will be a coordinated effort with possibly thousands of people that starts tomorrow and continues over the next several weeks. I have activated the @TheNationsFirst to deliver hot plates and provide support and resources for the assessment team.
On Wednesday, the team will begin the process to assess the damage in impacted residences and workplaces. This assessment will be completed by groups of plumbers, electricians, guardsmen, translators and assessors to determine what appliances need to be replaced.
Starting Monday, the team will start the process of installing space heaters into the homes that can safely support these appliances. Local fire departments will be part of this process, and a short inspection will be necessary.
Starting tomorrow, the team will launch a mitigation operation to provide all three communities with electric cooking appliances, or hot plates, so people can have a hot meal at home. Each community will distribute them differently.
Joe Albanese has deep ties and strong roots in Massachusetts, spent 25 year of military service with the naval construction forces and founded Commodore Builders in 2002. He will be responsible for command, control and communications + be assisted by Rear Admiral Richard Cellon.
Now the work to safely restore gas service is underway, and I have used my executive authority to instruct the DPU to request that Columbia Gas hire an outside contractor and they have selected Navy Captain Joe Albanese to be the Chief Recovery Officer.
Since day one of this tragedy, the call to action was answered by state agencies, nonprofits, Columbia Gas, multiple utilities, first responders and the good citizens of the Commonwealth. Together, they delivered resources, food, shelter and support for those in need.
While the road to recovery is long, the team has made progress over the past seven days to build a recovery framework, devise next steps and to begin rebuilding our communities. They say it takes an army. In this difficult situation, that could not be more true.
This tragic event for the Greater Lawrence area has created incredible hardship, and immeasurable sadness for the families who have lost their home and for those injured in the explosions. And for the family of Leo Rondon, they lost a wonderful young man. https://t.co/ooopnISAiz

PRESS RELEASE: Public Safety Officials Announce Update on Phase One Recovery Efforts, Allow Evacuated Residents To Return Home at 7AM  üîó: https://t.co/eJZGaGZjef https://t.co/gzBHAomBzO
The Recovery Resource Center will be staffed by the @RedCrossMA, Salvation Army and other disaster relief organizations, as well as representatives from state agencies including the @DTA_Listens, @MA_DHCD, @Mass_DCF, @MassDMH, @MassRMV, and the Division of Insurance.
Last night we announced that a Recovery Resource Center will open in Lawrence today at 1PM to help the residents who were affected by Thursday‚Äôs incident. The center will be located at the Arlington Middle School in Lawrence, where the existing emergency shelter is located now.
Phase 2 will consist of assessing the damage to the low pressure gas system, and Phase 3 will consist of technicians inspecting every piece of equipment from the meter, where gas enters a building, to the equipment throughout a building that distributes gas to all the appliances.
Eversource has worked hard to coordinate this operation with Columbia Gas and National Grid, and National Grid has been a strong partner in coordinating the return of electricity. While we have made significant progress, there are still two major phases in recovery efforts.
When people return home, we ask they are vigilant and take notice of any damage that may have occurred. &gt; If you notice any fire related damages to appliances or gas heating systems: Call 911. &gt; If you smell gas: Call 911.
We still have a long way to go, but I am so happy that people can return back home this morning. There will be 120 representatives from the utilities out in neighborhoods in the three communities to assist with any questions people may have as they return home.
The explosions have brought heartbreak for numerous families‚Äîand the loss of a young life. After spending some time visiting shelters and the local hospital, it is evident that the residents of the Merrimack Valley and Massachusetts are coming together to be supportive and kind.
It‚Äôs been a difficult and grueling weekend for North Andover, Andover and Lawrence residents. I often say the people of the Commonwealth are resilient‚Äîand this devastating situation is no exception. Thank you for being patient + heeding the instructions from officials to be safe.
After three nights of being displaced from their homes, I want to wholeheartedly thank the members of our police and fire departments who have worked non-stop and our utility companies from all over the country who are making these impacted homes safe.
As of 6:30AM, approximately 15,000 residents have power restored, and nearly 100% will have power restored shortly. Our teams are working as we speak and have the resources to re-energize the remaining small percentage of homes. https://t.co/eJZGaGZjef
Teams accessed the nearly 8,600 meters that were impacted by the gas incident, turned them off, and safely cleared the home for any gas detection. As of 6:30AM, all impacted home have been safely cleared of gas. https://t.co/eJZGaGZjef
Since last night, our team of first responders + utility resources have been working tirelessly to complete Phase 1 of our recovery efforts. We're pleased to report they've made tremendous progress, and residents in North Andover, Andover + Lawrence may return to their homes now.
We are opening a Recovery Resource Center to ensure that the people who were impacted by Thursday‚Äôs gas line incident have access to the resources they need to get back on their feet. https://t.co/vgkl9TmOHy  Arlington Middle School 150 Arlington Street Lawrence, MA https://t.co/qf8mltLqpN
The people of #Lawrence, #Andover and #NorthAndover have been incredibly supportive of one another. Thank you all for your patience + support as the crews get out there and do this work. And again, thank you to our first responders who have stepped up to answer the call of duty.
Today, I also spoke with the CEO of NiSource. I stressed to him just how vital it is that they marshal every available resource to assist the restoration effort. I also made clear to them how vital it is they support the people of Andover, North Andover and Lawrence.
When people return home, we ask they are vigilant and take notice of any damage that may have occurred.  &gt; If you notice any fire related damages to appliances or gas heating systems: Call 911. &gt; If you smell gas: Call 911.
We expect to have the vast majority of the remaining homes done and cleared for gas tonight, and the entire effort of Phase 1 substantially complete overnight, then people can return to their homes at 7AM tomorrow morning.
None of this work is easy and requires massive numbers of personnel working together. More than 900 resources are currently deployed working to complete Phase One. Resources and personnel have come in from as far away as Ohio. Clearly, when the call went out, it was answered.
Phase 2 will consist of assessing the damage to the low pressure gas system, and Phase 3 will consist of technicians inspecting every piece of equipment from the meter, where gas enters a building, to the equipment throughout a building that distributes gas to all the appliances.
The first phase is all about getting people back into their homes safely and restoring electricity. Technicians and fire personnel are deployed to work designated areas one at a time. They are shutting off gas meters and inspecting buildings to make sure it is safe to re-enter.
Local, State and Federal officials have been working around the clock. While we all know that there is a lot of work left to do, we are starting to make some progress.   The work to recover from this incident is being broken down into three phases.
Yesterday, I declared a state of emergency that allowed @EversourceMA to take control over a plan to restore utilities in the affected areas. They quickly mobilized a leadership team, set up a centrally located command center + organized the deployment of hundreds of gas workers.
We‚Äôve also heard from a lot of people who want to help out and make a donation. We encourage them to donate to the #Lawrence Emergency Fund: https://t.co/AURo0ZWK1L. We have other information and resources on @MassGov: https://t.co/CZJ9zYxlyU.
#Andover, #NorthAndover and #Lawrence have shelters available tonight. We are working with the @RedCrossMA and other providers to make people as comfortable as possible during this tough time at our locally run shelters.
It is essential that crews get this right to ensure safety, and we remind people to not turn on the gas in your home. Crews must do that for you. We ask everyone remain calm and be as patient as possible while the utilities work this issue block by block, house by house.
.@EversourceMA is now in the process of mobilizing a command center, establishing a leadership team and getting resources to the area, and we will continue to coordinate with them. They have already brought in more than 100 natural gas technicians with plans to bring in more.
This afternoon, I declared a State of Emergency, which authorized DPU to allow @EversourceMA to take over utility restoration efforts. We took this step after it became clear to us that Columbia Gas was inadequately prepared to take the steps needed. https://t.co/CZJ9zYxlyU
Our priority remains getting electricity to the affected households as quickly as possible, while ensuring the safety of residents.
Once again, tonight I want to thank our first responders and firefighters from communities across the Commonwealth that have responded to the situation in #Lawrence, #Andover and #NorthAndover. #MVGasFire

We ask for continued patience as this important work is done. Once utilities secure the affected areas, we will work with the federal government to investigate how this occurred and hold people accountable for their actions.
We have brought in and will continue to bring in hundreds of natural gas technicians who will deploy throughout the neighborhoods to do the work they need to do, house by house, to ensure each building is safe to occupy. Once neighborhoods are cleared, the power can be restored.
Overnight last night and through this morning, state and local officials have brought together every resource available to get people safely back in their homes. This will not be a simple process but doing it right is essential to making sure everyone remains safe.
Yesterday, firefighters and first responders answered the call to respond to a very serious situation and neighbors stepped up to help each other get to a safe place. We are enormously grateful for everyone‚Äôs cooperation with the evacuation orders. #MVGasFire https://t.co/xuu34op6DI

This has been an incredibly difficult day for everyone.  I ask everyone to think of the family of Leonel Rondon who lost a loved one today, and to pray for everyone who has been injured.
At this time our focus is on ensuring the public‚Äôs safety. Once that is complete, we will work with the federal government to investigate how this occurred and hold people accountable for their actions.
I have made clear to the utility company that they must immediately bring in additional resources + develop a comprehensive safety inspection plan for these communities. The utility must communicate to residents their remedial plan + when they can expect to return to their homes.
I can‚Äôt reiterate this enough: residents must heed instructions from local officials, law enforcement and first responders regarding public safety announcements, including about evacuations and gas usage.
I have spoken with local officials, state authorities and the utilities about how important it is to do the work needed to ensure all infrastructure is inspected thoroughly and efficiently. Police, fire and first responders from across the region have also done an incredible job.
Today‚Äôs incidents have been traumatic for residents of #Lawrence, #Andover + #NorthAndover. Thankfully, neighbors helped neighbors + 1st responders jumped into action. Despite the fluid situation, local, state + federal partners are working to ensure these communities are safe.

It‚Äôs clear how these broadband connections can have immediate positive impacts in previously underserved communities.The best measure of the impact of this program is the feedback from community leaders and the residents who are benefiting from this expanded connectivity. https://t.co/XIOZqLBRra
Our criminal justice system is only as good strong as the tools we give it. These reforms are designed to make sure law enforcement and prosecutors are positioned to do the work that they need to do to go after people who continually break the law.   üîó: https://t.co/xu3szQRwIN https://t.co/XofBORc9AN
Among other reforms, this bill expands the offenses that can provide grounds for a dangerousness hearing + closes certain loopholes at the start + end of the criminal process that currently limit or prevent effective action to address safety concerns.  üîó: https://t.co/bvHpFUFsh6
The alarming frequency of these events confirmed that we need to fix a broken law, so we worked closely with law enforcement, DAs and victims advocacy groups and consulted with the courts to draft reforms to do a better job of protecting communities from dangerous defendants.
Recent tragedies have demonstrated the tremendous damage that can occur when our criminal justice system fails to identify and detain dangerous people charged with serious crimes, and today I am filing legislation to protect the public from people who repeatedly break the law. https://t.co/gmKipnbbN4
We want to enable schools to be able to employ the expertise of professional that can help students, and spot trouble signs before there is a tragedy. We look forward to working with legislators to get this bill passed and get this important funding into our children‚Äôs schools.

Since 2015, our Administration has pushed forward the production of more than 15,000 new housing units, and with our partners at @MassHousing, @CEDACma, and @mhphousing, we‚Äôve preserved tens of thousands of units of #AffordableHousing across Massachusetts.
This year‚Äôs #AffordableHousing awards will support the preservation + creation of housing units in every region of Massachusetts, adding new vibrancy to neighborhoods, providing opportunities to families and residents, and helping us knit together a stronger Commonwealth.
The lack of #AffordableHousing is hurting our young families, our growing workforce, and our older adults; it is forcing lifelong residents out of their neighborhoods; and it is our biggest roadblock to continued economic success.  This is why #housing has been a priority for us.
Today we‚Äôre standing on a lot filled with construction vehicles that will be transformed into 54 units of #AffordableHousing for low-income seniors.

Purdue Pharma started selling OxyContin in the 90s. It didn't take very long for people to figure out that it was terribly addictive. By the mid-2000s there was simply no debate that these pills were causing chaos, heartache + death. Instead of stepping back, Purdue doubled down.

Since 2015, we've invested more than $274 million into 134 communities across Massachusetts through #MassWorks, our most effective tool to spur economic development. We have empowered communities to attract new mixed-use development, including housing, retail + commercial space.

Today, I renew the call ‚Äî echoed by the addiction treatment and recovery community ‚Äî for the Legislature to act in these final days of the legislative session to pass the CARE Act before we lose the momentum we have gained in this crisis.
We still have a lot of work to do, especially as the presence of fentanyl continues to rise. I am pleased that the "Fentanyl Fix," as well as the linking of state drug classifications to emergency federal drug scheduling, were in the bill I signed into law earlier this month.
In our FY19 budget proposal, we included $5M for a new trust fund created by this bill that will support the expansion of education programs &amp; the development of information systems to ID at-risk students, and enable the implementation of new school-based support models.
Just as we work through our school systems to educate our kids, from elementary school through college, on the dangers of alcohol and drugs, it is imperative that we increase addiction prevention awareness for opioids through a structured approach for every school level.
To better work with the dental and medical community to cut down on overprescribing, our bill establishes a commission to review appropriate prescribing practices for common procedures and ID recommended Rx for these acute conditions using prepackaging, or blister packs.
Some of the most haunting stories of addiction start with our own trusted physicians prescribing a highly addictive opioid in large quantities to ease pain after routine surgeries ‚Äî such as getting your wisdom teeth removed.
Still: Prescription opioids are highly addictive and dangerous when overprescribed. The CARE Act focuses on collecting more data, reducing fraud and better enforcing existing laws, starting with a mandate for all prescribers to convert to using secure, e-prescriptions by 2020.
Massachusetts is seeing progress by sharpening the use of certain tools, like the prescription monitoring program, to increase accountability, improve information sharing and track prescriptions more closely.
Our legislation aims to fix this issue by creating three pathways for emergency departments to expand pathways for treatment for individuals.
The bill we signed into law in 2016 required patients in the ER to be offered a substance use evaluation and connection to treatment within 24 hours of an overdose. Available data suggests 50-90% of patients decline this evaluation and leave the hospital without an assessment.
Hospital emergency departments are a first line of response for individuals experiencing a medical crisis related to substance use. Since 2011, opioid-related emergency department visits in Massachusetts have more than doubled.
Recovery coaches are essential to helping people get into treatment and maintain their sobriety, and the CARE Act calls for raising their profile and establishing credentialing standards. Our communities, the Legislature and insurance companies must recognize their importance.
Since 2015, our admin has added 1100+ treatment beds, and over the next 5 years, we will add ~125 residential recovery beds each year with capacity to treat individuals with co-occurring disorders.   The CARE Act seeks to ensure these beds are put to good use &amp; reach more people.
The #MACAREAct builds upon the work of the STEP Act and offers a more targeted approach to expanding our educational efforts, preventing opioid misuse and addressing barriers to treatment and gaps in care. It is currently awaiting action from the Legislature.
After more than two years of implementing new programs, collecting more data and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders, for the first time, opioid-related deaths have decreased. And to continue this progress, in November, we filed our second package: the CARE Act.
To better help law enforcement, we filed legislation last summer to crack down on drug trafficking and create stricter sentencing for anyone caught selling deadly drugs ‚Äî including heroin or fentanyl ‚Äî that lead to a user's death. On April 13th, I signed that into law.
We partnered with our colleges and universities, and today nearly every future prescriber educated in Massachusetts receives mandatory opioid training. We brought together our 9 schools of social work to adopt core curriculum for our largest cadre of behavioral health clinicians.
Our first major move was the bipartisan enactment of the STEP Act, which established MA as the first state in the nation to implement a seven day limit on first-time opioid prescriptions for adults. Today, opioid prescriptions are down by nearly 30% in the Commonwealth.
Our administration made it a team effort to take a big swing at dozens of reforms and legislation to fight this crisis. We are seeing some progress, and are also pleased that some of our efforts are being used as a national blue print to help other states.
Before becoming governor and lieutenant governor, @MassLtGov and I quickly learned the #OpioidEpidemic was something that must be prioritized after hearing gut-wrenching stories from people everywhere we went.
The #EconDev bill we filed last month would continue funding this successful program, with a $75 million authorization that will expand + improve programs training students and adult-learners in high-demand skills in manufacturing, IT and other high-growth sectors. #SkillsCapital https://t.co/NqJUFi94pJ

In 2015, amid a rising tide of overdose deaths, the Legislature enacted legislation that established for the first time a new offense of Trafficking in Fentanyl. However, subtle differences in language from a similar heroin provision has had dramatic and unforeseen consequences.
We‚Äôve seen progress on opioids in Massachusetts ‚Äì related deaths were down 8.3% last year but there was fentanyl present in 83% of them.

It will also put into law our popular Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) grant program, which enrolled more than 20% of our cities and towns, including Scituate, in its effort to plan for and build resilience to #ClimateChange. https://t.co/KNKN4R1J6Z
This bill would put into law essential components of our Executive Order 569, which established an integrated strategy for #ClimateChange adaptation. This includes ensuring the statewide Hazard Mitigation and Adaptation Plan will be continuously updated for future generations.
Today, we are filing legislation to authorize $1.4 billion in capital allocations for investments in safeguarding municipalities + businesses from the impacts of #ClimateChange, including $300M of spending to specifically plan, prepare + adapt. https://t.co/xmDHkTjcqb https://t.co/CEXg9LNUME
Our administration is committed to helping our cities and towns recover from these storms, and even more importantly, to expand and redouble our efforts to work across the Commonwealth to better prepare and build resilience for the challenges ahead. #ClimateChange
Over the course of the last three years, Massachusetts has had to confront a variety of weather challenges:  ‚ùÑÔ∏è Historic snow in the winter of 2015 ‚òÄÔ∏è Serious drought in 2016 üåä Since January, four major nor'easters, 2 of which brought historic tides, storm surge + flooding. https://t.co/gwJB8PB7Aw

@SpfldRegChamber "An Act Enhancing Opportunities for All" builds on the vision we've created together for Massachusetts, one that promotes the vitality of communities, grows businesses, and supports the prosperity of people. We look forward to working with the Legislature to make it law.
@SpfldRegChamber We are also proposing an #Apprenticeship Tax Credit for companies that want to hire + train new employees in the high-demand areas of healthcare, manufacturing + IT so people can earn a wage while they learn &amp; employers can afford to create their own pipeline of skilled workers.
@SpfldRegChamber So consumers, retailers, and fiscal planners have more predictability, our legislation makes a #SalesTaxHoliday a permanent fixture in Massachusetts.
@SpfldRegChamber A number of changes to existing law are part of it, including giving more flexibility to our #housing authorities to leverage their most significant asset - the land they own - to address long-deferred capital needs and pursue redevelopment partnerships.
@SpfldRegChamber It also contains a $100 million authorization for a new Regional Development Program, so we can partner with communities on major job creation projects that will have a strong impact on the regional economy.
@SpfldRegChamber Today‚Äôs new legislation includes substantial reauthorizations for highly successful programs, including #MassWorks, our #SkillsCapital program, and #M2I2, which supports tremendous research and commercialization of next-gen advanced manufacturing technologies.
@SpfldRegChamber This bill represents our commitment to continuously evaluate what works + address challenges facing our communities. It is the result of ongoing assessments of our programs created via the 2016 #EconDev bill, feedback from stakeholders &amp; close collaboration w/ municipal leaders.
@SpfldRegChamber Since we came into office in 2015, we have invested more than $430 million in capital in more than 130 cities and towns to promote economic vitality for communities, economic growth for businesses, and economic prosperity to residents.

While lower snow totals and a mix of rain are forecast for Eastern Massachusetts, folks still need to travel carefully, utilize public transportation, and plan ahead for a slow and difficult evening commute. #MAsnow https://t.co/ixYVBZGCGj
Given the heavy, wet nature of this snow, some areas could experience power outages. Utility companies and mutual aid partners are staging crews throughout the region to respond to power outages. #MAsnow
The rate of snowfall will be as high as 2-3"/hour across #WMass &amp; #CMass at times, which is too high a rate for plows to clear the roads entirely. Please avoid driving in those parts of MA if at all possible so our plow drivers can do their work safely. #MAsnow #DontCrowdThePlow
Everyone should expect a long &amp; challenging commute home this evening due to rapid snowfall that will start midday. For anyone who lives or works west of 128, beginning this afternoon &amp; lasting through the evening, driving will become treacherous &amp; you need to plan ahead. #MAsnow
This storm will create different weather challenges for every region:   &gt; High #MAsnow totals in the Berkshires &amp; Worcester Hills;  &gt; Hazardous driving conditions in on all roadways starting at Route 128 &amp; west; &gt; A risk of scattered power outages and minor to moderate flooding.

Yesterday, I signed an executive order to activate @TheNationsFirst, and guardsmen and women &amp; 53 MANG vehicles have been an important part of our efforts to assist communities. From Cape Ann to the Cape, these men and women have been helping those stranded by the rising waters.
Don't try to drive or walk through flooded areas. It puts you in danger, as well as the first responders who would have to rescue you. And tonight is not the night to check out the storm ‚Ä¶ please stay safely away from the waves, water, and downed power lines.
We cannot stress this enough: if you have been asked to evacuate by your city or town, please do so immediately. With the next high tide hitting while most of us are sleeping, it could make for dangerous rescue situations if people get stuck in their homes.
We have a long way to go still in this storm. We have seen significant power outages, and some areas could be without power for an extended period of time given the high winds.  If you need help finding a shelter, or other services, please call 211 or https://t.co/d2hKiKJ5aj.
We are in the middle of this storm and the high winds, rain, snow and coastal flooding will continue throughout tonight and into tomorrow. Thank you to everyone who heeded our warnings to stay home, off the roads or evacuate their neighborhoods. https://t.co/1xG7T4WSg4

We cannot stress enough: this storm is shaping up to be more severe than the storm on 1/4. If you live in an area that is told to evacuate, we strongly encourage you do so first thing Friday AM. Staying in homes that are in flood prone areas puts you &amp; first responders at risk.
Over the past several hours, @TheNationsFirst has started to mobilize 53 vehicles for their mission. 36 vehicles will support 17 municipalities, and 17 vehicles will provide regional support from State Police barracks across the Commonwealth, and at Joint Base Cape Cod.
Our administration is asking employers located in areas where flooding tends to occur, like the Seaport and North End, to consider closing or allowing employees to work from home tomorrow.
For customers using these services to commute, please consider the possibility of significant delays or cancellations for the afternoon commute home on Friday. Commuters are asked to monitor https://t.co/zzyp9A0Qe0, @mbta &amp; @mbta_cr, #MBTA alerts, as well as broadcast media.
Many roadways that have a tendency to flood may be impassable tomorrow with the first high tide, and may remain impassable for several hours. Based on the current forecast, the #MBTA is planning for significant impacts to the Rockport/Newburyport &amp; Haverhill lines &amp; Blue Line.
All shorelines are at risk for moderate to major coastal flooding and severe erosion. Heavy rain, and possibly snow, will also cause street flooding and significant rises in rivers and streams. Strong wind gusts may cause tree damage and scattered power outages. #MAwx

@TheNationsFirst @MassEMA @Massport If you live in an area that is told to evacuate, we strongly encourage you do so first thing Friday morning. Many residents may not be able to return until late Saturday or Sunday - that means plan for your medicine, clothing, food, money and pets.
@TheNationsFirst @MassEMA The #MBTA, Commuter Rail, and @MassPort are deploying resources to prepare for flooding in known flood zones. As we saw in the January 4th storm some MBTA assets will be impacted by severe flooding.
@TheNationsFirst @MassEMA All shorelines are at risk for moderate to major coastal flooding and severe erosion at some point during this storm. There is also real potential for significant structural damage along the coast. The strong wind gusts may cause tree damage and scattered power outages.
@TheNationsFirst @MassEMA The coastal #flooding for this storm is forecasted to more severe than the storm that hit the Commonwealth on January 4th. We are expecting to see flooding to the same level or higher in prone areas along a majority of our coast.
@TheNationsFirst A top priority for @MassEMA and @TheNationsFirst will be working with our coastal communities to deploy high-water rescue vehicles to any coastal community that has requested one and the National Guard is also proactively staging teams &amp; vehicles across different coastal regions.
With a major coastal storm forecast to impact Massachusetts beginning tonight &amp; lasting through Saturday, I just signed an order to activate @TheNationsFirst.

This project will transform this state asset into a thriving economic development opportunity that will include hundreds of improved housing options, thousands of square feet of space for new businesses, new jobs and an enhanced open space within this local community. #Fenway
Fenway Center is a perfect example of the importance of working closely with the private sector and our municipal partners to help meet local development priorities and encourage economic growth. #Fenway https://t.co/p1drVNbBMt
I am proud that after nearly two decades of negotiations, our Administration recently closed on the lease agreement for Phase I of the #Fenway Center Development Project, which is allowing us to break ground on this project today. https://t.co/xA8wDhvOVe
As we strive to find more creative ways to encourage more housing, we believe this bill is a key component of our long-term plan. With the Legislature's support, we can promote housing growth that is smart, responsive to local needs, and environmentally friendly. #HousingChoice
Our proposed legislation is part of our comprehensive strategy to build 135,000 new #housing units over the next seven years and builds on our new #HousingChoice Initiative. https://t.co/2OXp6Kh4zf https://t.co/dOnWCY6Jnr
The bill also reflects a belief that policies encouraging #housing growth should align with other values our Administration has championed, such as our commitment to encourage good stewardship of our environment and reduce greenhouse gases. #HousingChoice
The Housing Choices bill before the Legislature offers a new approach to address this challenge by making it easier for local decision-makers to adopt best practice zoning policies that will bring about sustainable #housing production across the state. #HousingChoice
We believe this must be done in partnership with local officials, and we are seeking to create a system of incentives, rewards, and technical assistance to encourage municipalities to plan and encourage #housing production. #HousingChoice
To really move the needle on #housing production, we need to rely on the power of the market. That means we need to work with municipalities to set the conditions that will allow the market to meet housing demand. #HousingChoice
However, we also understand that there is no way that the State can fund enough subsidies to drive the level of #housing production that we need to meet demand. #HousingChoice
We have significantly expanded investments in workforce and #AffordableHousing and committed more than $1.1B in capital funding over the next five years, offered state land for housing development, and made a series of reforms to prompt #housing production. #HousingChoice https://t.co/r6lF2WkQd1
The bottom line: Massachusetts needs to build more housing to remain competitive economically and to serve the needs of all of our residents. #HousingChoice
Massachusetts offers incredible assets that make us a place where families want to live and where employers want to grow. Yet, we are not building the multi-family housing units to accommodate the workforce we need to continue our economic growth. #HousingChoice
With the Legislature &amp; local officials, we must confront the issue of housing production in MA. A limited supply creates overheated demand and rising prices. Young people, seniors, young, working and middle class families can‚Äôt afford to rent or buy a home here. #HousingChoice https://t.co/7Snphmn1J0
Most of us cannot begin to imagine what these families have been through, and the Commonwealth will continue to provide necessary support to help our fellow Americans from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The Commonwealth has welcomed hundreds of families in the wake of these devastating hurricanes and this important funding will provide crucial support for our schools. https://t.co/sjJoGfKnOw

Through tax credits, new programs and increased investments, this proposal will support working families as well as small businesses and enhance programs to make college more affordable, fight the opioid epidemic and get workers the skills they need to compete for better jobs.
Yesterday, Governor Baker filed a fiscally responsible budget proposal that continues to support every community in the Commonwealth‚Äîwithout raising taxes on the people of Massachusetts. https://t.co/OVCGsXCUoY https://t.co/ZOGmKEpuKh

To practice good government and rein in spending, we are again filing a proposal that would place a reasonable cap on accrued sick time for executive branch employees, and extend the proposal to higher education so taxpayers will stop footing the bill for excessive payouts.
Building on our administration's work to mitigate and adapt to climate change, House 2 includes $2 million in new funding for municipal technical support, climate science, and targeted investments in environmental justice. https://t.co/VoJbkwBbbe
We recently announced our #HousingChoice Initiative to encourage municipalities to plan for and build the diverse housing stock the Commonwealth needs , and our budget has nearly $3 million in new funding to provide this program incentives, grant funding &amp; technical assistance. https://t.co/SlrizlMO5r
DTA has renewed its efforts to support economic mobility &amp; employment for individuals &amp; their families. This budget invests $4 million to build on these efforts to get people back to work in sustainable jobs and on a path to long-term self-sufficiency. https://t.co/ykcZIDnHlE
Once again, we propose to fully-fund the Turning 22 program through the Department of Developmental Services, and provide $16.8 million in increased funding to support individuals with changing needs within the DDS client base.
House 2 recommends a historic increase of $93.2 million for the Department of Mental Health (@MassDMH), much of which will go to community-based services for adults. The new model integrates behavioral and physical health. https://t.co/hM60KJECpk
Additionally, the @MassAGO‚Äôs office is given an increase to nearly $2 million to pursue investigations, ranging from fraudulent prescribing practices to fentanyl trafficking. #OpioidCrisis
House 2 includes new funding for prevention and recovery efforts, including $5 million for a new Substance Use Prevention, Education, and Screening Trust Fund to implement effective school-based prevention and intervention programs and provide grants for students in need. https://t.co/ZDjqFkrjro
We are also proposing $3 million in new support for an early college program that will focus on engaging student populations who are currently underrepresented in college and encouraging students to enter #STEM fields.
This new MassGrant funding, the largest increase in scholarship assistance in over a decade, will close any remaining gap in financial aid for tuition and fees for all full and part-time students at the Commonwealth's 15 community colleges.
This budget includes over $100 million in scholarship assistance for students pursuing post-secondary education at campuses across the Commonwealth, including $7.1 million to double the MassGrant program for community college students. https://t.co/3r0Y5omnHp
Last year's budget provided one of the largest increases in funding for early childhood education in over a decade. We‚Äôve been able to deliver a $46 million wage increase for teachers thus far, which will be annualized in this year's budget. https://t.co/sac8DscVHp
For cities and towns interested in pursuing an Empowerment Zone Partnership, $100,000 is allotted for planning grants, allowing more communities to adopt budgets, curriculum and administrative changes similar to the model in Springfield. https://t.co/iKm3kRVla4
To support our small business community and the Commonwealth's thriving entrepreneurs, we are also proposing to cut the filing fee for forming an LLC in half to $250, easing the burden on folks looking to do business in the Commonwealth. https://t.co/Fvuz50otK4
In 2015, we worked with the legislature to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to increase take home pay for working families. This budget proposes increasing the tax credit to 30% of the federal credit, providing 450,000 residents with additional tax relief in FY20. https://t.co/2I25TCwQMY
In the midst of the #OpioidCrisis, we increased annual spending for substance misuse prevention by nearly 60%, totaling more than $187M with this proposal. In the next 5 years, we will invest an additional $200 million in addiction services &amp; bring 500 new treatment beds online.
In Fiscal Year 2015, the budget relied on $1.2 billion worth of non-recurring revenue sources. This proposal relies on less than $100 million in one-time sources. https://t.co/EAv1aE8vw5
This budget builds on our previous investments, and includes new proposals for college affordability, mental health services and workforce development- without raising taxes.

Most of all, we gather here tonight as the grateful recipients of a profound opportunity to serve the great people of this great state. Let‚Äôs make the most of it. God bless this Commonwealth and God bless the United States of America. #MASOTC
We‚Äôve done great work with the legislature on many important issues, but our work has just begun. We stand ready to do so much more on housing, economic development, life sciences, education, criminal justice, community building, transportation, and addiction. #MASOTC https://t.co/3UqWzwccuT
We live in a great state, filled with creative, community minded, hard-working, decent people and what they want from us is opportunity, possibility, and hope. Not noise, not name-calling, and not finger pointing‚Äîprogress on the things that help them help themselves. #MASOTC https://t.co/mgye7dojq7
It‚Äôs our job to create the cohesion envisioned by those who came before us. To move this state forward. To protect and fight for its interests‚Äîand its people. And to never forget that we are the lucky ones. #MASOTC
We owe every citizen our best efforts. But we owe those who have paid the ultimate price to keep us free something more. We owe them the humility to understand that what we do in this building is tied to something so much bigger than partisanship. #MASOTC https://t.co/Qeiyw0c2LW
We should recognize and never forget why we have this precious chance to serve our fellow citizens.  For generations, people put themselves in harm‚Äôs way so the rest of us could create and nurture a democracy based on a very simple concept: ‚ÄúOut of Many ‚Äì One.‚Äù #MASOTC https://t.co/PvB5ml9oex
This requires that we commit ourselves to a common decency in our debate and in our dealings with one another and the public. That doesn‚Äôt mean we always have to agree. We won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs called democracy, and more often than not it works. #MASOTC
To help them get a great education. To live in a great community. To get a great job. To live a long and healthy life. To believe in their own future‚Äîand the future for their kids and their families. But we also want people to believe in their government. #MASOTC https://t.co/B0I9zgqLIf
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being too simplistic when I say we are all here to help people. We may differ about how we get that done‚Äîbut we all share that goal. We want to create opportunities for people. #MASOTC
And it seems to be working for kids. I‚Äôve visited these schools three times and every time come away full of optimism for all involved. Collaborative approaches like this one are working in Springfield, and can work in other struggling districts as well. #maedu #MASOTC https://t.co/WKdyDcmXDN
While our schools are the envy of the nation, we still have more to do to close the opportunity gap. In the Springfield Empowerment Zone, teachers and administrators are given the chance to share decision-making on professional development, curriculum, budgets‚Äîthe works. #MASOTC https://t.co/XG6WTcah74
Our discussions with the legislature and the other interested parties about #MassHealth have been helpful. And we believe our shared goals of quality care and long-term sustainability can be achieved. #MASOTC
Thanks to the strength of our economy, our welfare caseload has dropped by 25 percent and our budget will include reforms that will help thousands more on public assistance find good jobs. #MASOTC
To increase the take home pay for 400,000 working families, we increased the Earned Income Tax Credit in 2015. We‚Äôre proposing another increase in our budget, which would result in a doubling of the benefit over 3 years. I look forward to signing that provision into law. #MASOTC
We filed legislation in 2017 that will make it possible to build more #housing. Our goal is 135,000 new units by 2025. We ask that this proposal be taken up soon because for too many people housing in Massachusetts is unaffordable. #HousingChoice #MASOTC https://t.co/42ltoH4qgW
We also have work to do to bolster behavioral health services. The budget we file tomorrow will include more than $83 million in new funding for the Department of Mental Health to strengthen its community based services for adults with serious mental illness. #MASOTC
Fentanyl was present in more than 80% of overdose deaths in 2017. A bipartisan fentanyl bill that makes it easier to arrest and convict dealers and traffickers is in the legislature's hands. I ask them to enact it as soon as possible. #OpioidCrisis #MASOTC
The legislature should move quickly to enact the #MACAREact. It will provide a framework for community based aftercare addiction services, expand school-based education, and broaden paths to treatment for people dealing with addiction. #OpioidCrisis #MASOTC https://t.co/VJPrfTHCmc
And we made an equally strong statement on women‚Äôs health care when we pledged that regardless of the outcome in D.C. no woman in Massachusetts will be denied reproductive health care services. #MASOTC https://t.co/IwSsWh6I76
We must continue to be vigilant to protect what has worked for us. And we‚Äôll continue to advocate for bipartisan fixes to the Affordable Care Act that many Governors‚ÄîDemocrats and Republicans‚Äîfought for last year. #MASOTC
On health care, we made a strong statement that in this Commonwealth everyone will have access to quality care. #MASOTC https://t.co/9Ra6mgtZRW
Despite the tremendous progress we‚Äôve made, our climate is still changing. We‚Äôll dedicate an additional $2M in our budget to climate adaptation &amp; resiliency planning, providing more support to municipalities &amp; accelerating statewide hazard mitigation planning. #MASOTC https://t.co/EbtkECtCRq
We are also making new investments in #EnergyStorage. By helping bridge the gaps in peak demand, expanded storage will boost the effectiveness of wind &amp; solar power, provide further price relief for ratepayers &amp; pave the way for a future independent from fossil fuels. #MASOTC
Later this year, we‚Äôll complete a competitive process that will lead to the largest offshore wind power operation in the nation. This effort will further reduce emissions and create thousands of green jobs in places like New Bedford. #CleanEnergy #MASOTC
In a few days, the Commonwealth will announce the results of the largest #RenewableEnergy procurement in our history. This process will lead to #CleanEnergy pricing that‚Äôs competitive with fossil fuels, a huge win for families, our businesses and our environment. #MASOTC https://t.co/h2Gdyjl9gy
In addition, to help the next generation of students get off to a good start, we delivered, with the Legislature's support, one of the largest increases in funding for early childhood education in over a decade in our 2018 budget. #EarlyEd #MASOTC https://t.co/B9mhS2K4V0
For students &amp; families struggling to pay for college: 1) we‚Äôll increase college scholarship funding by more than $7 million; 2) we‚Äôll significantly expand our #EarlyCollege programs; and 3) we‚Äôll continue expanding our Commonwealth Commitment plan. #MAComCom #MASOTC https://t.co/jCeZjhunF9
To continue our state‚Äôs momentum in education, we are funding K-12 education at the highest level in history: more than $4.7 billion. Our FY19 budget will boost that by more than $100 million, representing an increase of nearly half a billion dollars since we took office. #MASOTC https://t.co/Q35F52w8vd
Over 20 years ago, we committed to what became a long-standing bipartisan investment in K-12 education, high standards, equitable funding, and other major reforms. It worked. #maedu #MASOTC https://t.co/IhuiJ3m0Xz
We‚Äôve also worked with local governments to welcome fellow citizens from Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricanes. State agencies have worked together to help thousands of families relocate here and find housing, schools, and jobs. #MASOTC https://t.co/9FCsPYWrCc
To support our coastal communities, we revived the Seaport Council, established a task force to study resiliency &amp; adaptability, and have begun making millions of dollars in strategic investments to preserve, protect &amp; properly use this natural resource. #ClimateChange #MASOTC https://t.co/8t78DWjppZ
Our program to plant 10,000 trees in Gateway Cities has been a success, and we look forward to planting 10,000 more. And by the fall of 2018, 71% of all municipal streetlights will be LEDs, saving communities money and cutting power usage by 60%. #MASOTC
When we took office, 50+ #WMass communities didn‚Äôt have access to broadband internet. The vast majority of communities that had none either have it now or have plans to install it. Thanks to the legislature‚Äôs help with funding, they will all have it over the next 2 years. #MASOTC https://t.co/hlz1rfuhh4
That‚Äôs why @MassLtGov and I have focused so much on strengthening communities. Funded by the legislature and overseen by Lt. Governor Polito, 330 cities &amp; towns have become partners, adopting more than 800 best practices. #CommunityCompact #MASOTC https://t.co/GaWpOPrtiJ
A strong Commonwealth is built on a foundation of strong communities. Friendly, welcoming, bustling neighborhoods and downtowns. Great schools. Safe, accessible, attractive places to play. Growing local economies. And a belief that anything is possible. #MASOTC https://t.co/ZxQgHS1sIA
I can stand here tonight and say without question, the state of our Commonwealth is strong! #MASOTC
Economically, we are hitting on all cylinders. In 2017, we had more people working than at any time in state history. Our economy has added 180k new jobs since we took office, and the number of people looking for work has dropped in every county‚Äîmost by more than 35%. #MASOTC https://t.co/jaaiNEgaJU
There is more to do on the #MBTA. Much more. But, for the first time in years, the plan to modernize the system is in place and moving forward. Fixing decades of neglect doesn't happen overnight, but we will deliver the public transit system that the people deserve. #MASOTC https://t.co/cbCH7GsvbB
As you know, our public transportation system collapsed during the brutal winter of 2015. But three years later, the #MBTA is investing hundreds of millions more on upgrading its core infrastructure than it has in years &amp; modernizing its operations. #MASOTC https://t.co/G4rteCGOtm
We‚Äôve built on MA‚Äôs historic commitment to #veterans. We enhanced the #GoldStar Families benefit, enacted the Home Act, created a tax credit for small businesses that hire veterans, and committed the funding necessary to rebuild the @ChelseaSOHO. #MASOTC https://t.co/1JgQHKVHZF

We began in the midst of an opioid crisis in which deaths, overdoses and prescriptions grew by double digits for more than a decade. Today, with the Legislature's help, we‚Äôve reduced opioid prescribing by 29%, and overdose deaths have dropped by 10%. #MASOTC https://t.co/rGJPdonqXc
We began with a state hospital in Bridgewater that for decades was beset by a series of terrible tragedies, yet nothing was done. Today, with the help of many, Bridgewater State Hospital is completely different and families finally have hope. #MASOTC
We began with a Health Connector that was, by all accounts, a mess. Today, it just finished its third consecutive positive open enrollment, providing more than 240,000 working families with affordable health care coverage. #MASOTC
We began with a Department of Children and Families in free fall. Today, 99% of its social workers are licensed, with the lowest caseloads they‚Äôve had in years and clinical teams supporting their work. #MASOTC
We began with 1,500 homeless families stuck in hotels and motels, isolated from their support systems. Today, there are fewer than 60 families --- that‚Äôs a 95% reduction. #MASOTC
We began with a $1 billion structural budget deficit. Today, we‚Äôve reduced that deficit to less than $100 million without raising taxes. #MASOTC https://t.co/2WgN3nFjBu
When @MassLtGov &amp; I began this journey 3 years ago, we set out to create a state government that worked well for the people who needed it most, and would be as creative, thrifty &amp; hard-working as the people of MA. While much remains to be done, we‚Äôve made great progress. #MASOTC https://t.co/zzeTob1L5G

We also look forward to working with our local cities and towns, and our partners in the Legislature, to move forward on two major pieces of legislation: 1) our #HousingChoice Initiative and 2) the #MACAREact, our second package targeting the opioid epidemic. #MassMuni18
This funding increase includes $15 million for school districts with significant enrollment of students from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and $24.3 million towards addressing the rising costs of healthcare for retirees, a major recommendation of the #FBRC. #MassMuni18
We recognize too that the strength of our communities is in our next generation - our schools, teachers and children. Next week, we'll propose a $118.6 million increase in local education funding. #MassMuni18 https://t.co/WQkwZaiW1V
On unrestricted local aid, we are committed to following through on a 100% of the consensus revenue tax growth estimate percentage - equal to 3.5%, totaling $1.099 billion in unrestricted general government aid to the Commonwealth‚Äôs 351 cities and towns. #MassMuni18
We created a new Rapid LED Streetlight Conversion program, and by the end of 2018, we expect that 96% of all municipally-owned streetlights will be converted to LEDs.

To mark the one-year anniversary of our #ClimateChange Executive Order, we held a municipal summit this fall where we discussed among other things, the MVP Grant Program, designed to support cities &amp; towns as they begin the process of planning for climate resiliency. #MassMuni18
We are especially proud of the work we've done to partner with towns in Western Mass to ensure they are increasingly connected to the digital economy. Last Mile grants totaling $19.5M are supporting broadband connection efforts to 13,000 homes &amp; businesses. #MassMuni18 #WMass
Our Administration created a new #CompleteStreets program in 2016 and has already granted $17.7 million to build safe bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in partnership with municipalities across the Commonwealth. #MassMuni18

Last week, Gov. Baker and Sec. Sudders sat down with @GBHJoe for an in-depth conversation on the #OpioidCrisis, including the administration's second significant package that received a legislative hearing yesterday. Listen to the discussion via @wgbhnews: https://t.co/QL50l3zIIh
We look forward to the important housing resources @SFHBoston &amp; @POUATweets will create with the @CityOfBoston through this project and we look forward to working with our colleagues in state &amp; local government to create similar opportunities across the Commonwealth. #48Boylston https://t.co/qLGyL0AX0U
Creating #affordablehousing for working families, low-income senior citizens &amp; the homeless is a top priority for us &amp; essential to creating a stronger Commonwealth, and we were proud to join @marty_walsh &amp; @CardinalSean to break ground on 46 units at The Union. #48Boylston https://t.co/lKOc78zT3I
The #MACAREAct builds upon the foundational work of the STEP Act and offers a targeted approach to expanding educational efforts, preventing opioid misuse and addressing barriers to treatment and gaps in care. We look forward to the Legislature acting to continue our progress. https://t.co/EaRTsiMzYc
The #MACAREAct also focuses on two areas where we must improve access to treatment: ensuring that people who are suffering from opioid addiction receive the specialized treatment they need and expanding access to treatment in the emergency room setting.
Recovery coaches offer acceptance through shared experiences and we must act to make sure these services are effective and available for more people seeking a path to #recovery. #MACAREAct #OpioidEpidemic
The #MACAREAct has a number of provisions to improve access to treatment, including creating a commission that will recommend standards to credential #recovery coaches, powerful tools to keep individuals in long-term recovery. #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/Os2YB9UZNV
As one of the most important prevention tools, the #MACAREAct increases access to naloxone by authorizing a state-wide, standing order that will make it easier for every pharmacy in the Commonwealth to dispense naloxone. #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/Id2yyp6Jjw
We‚Äôve trained nearly 4,000 school staff in 283 districts, resulting in 22,000 students screened for substance use disorders. The #MACAREAct builds on that by creating a trust fund to help finance the expansion of educational &amp; intervention programs in schools. #OpioidEpidemic
In the nearly two years since the STEP Act‚Äôs enactment and our collective efforts, we are now seeing early signs of progress. We have become a national example, and for the first time, opioid-related deaths in the Commonwealth have decreased by 10%. #MACAREAct #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/h2xn3SSLBg
We have improved education for young people, educators, and medical professionals about the risks of opioid misuse, and today more than 56,000 people are now trained to use the lifesaving, overdose reversal drug naloxone. #MACAREAct #OpioidEpidemic
Through the 2016 STEP Act, we established the first seven day limit on first-time opioid prescriptions for adults, and completely revamped the prescription monitoring program. Today, opioid prescriptions are down by nearly 30% in the Commonwealth. #MACAREAct #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/NfbNKCuCd4
The #MACAREAct will allow the Commonwealth to build upon our efforts to address the #OpioidEpidemic by continuing to expand pathways to treatment &amp; recovery services, holding the medical community accountable for their prescribing, and strengthening education &amp; prevention tools. https://t.co/LRUTRltmhM

The President‚Äôs recent declaration of the opioid crisis as a public health emergency provides an opportunity for the federal government to support states like Massachusetts with additional tools, and we will be requesting swift administrative action by federal authorities.
Because young people are particularly vulnerable to engaging in risky behavior, we will pursue immediate administrative actions to continue educating students, parents and teachers on the dangers of opioids and addiction from elementary school through college. https://t.co/kCGWSsAATb
