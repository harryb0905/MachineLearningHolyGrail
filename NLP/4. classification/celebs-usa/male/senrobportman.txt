While the specific funding for new barriers ($1.375B) is less than @POTUS’ requested, it is more than Congress has ever provided for new barrier construction in past years. 55 miles in new barriers combined w/ other initiatives is a positive step forward for border security.
The bipartisan funding agreement, w/ $22.5B in total border security funding (only about $300M or 1.3% less than @POTUS requested), makes southern border more secure through more barrier construction, more technology &amp; cameras, &amp; better screening at ports of entry.

Last night on the @SenateFloor I discussed my bipartisan Trade Security Act, which will protect American #jobs by ensuring that we use this trade remedy only when there is a genuine national security threat. https://t.co/XlvLZPSBW2
My End Government Shutdowns Act ensures that gov’t services aren’t disrupted &amp; protects taxpayers who must bear the resulting cost. It currently has 33 cosponsors, a bipartisan House companion bill &amp; widespread backing from the nation’s editorial boards: https://t.co/D1Hniyfhl7
I was honored to pay tribute today at Deputy Bill Brewer’s funeral service.  He was a true hero who gave the ultimate sacrifice while protecting the people of Clermont County.
Good read from the #Cleveland Plain Dealer ed board on why my End Gov’t Shutdowns bill is needed right now. We now have 33 cosponsors &amp; I continue to work to build support for this common-sense fix. https://t.co/SLDL09XXdr
I had the chance to get to know John Dingell when I served in the House. Big John was a legendary figure in the history of the Congress, and it was an honor to call him my friend. Jane &amp; I are sending our love and prayers to Debbie and the entire Dingell family.
Was honored to meet Frank Robinson and his wonderful wife and daughter in his final role as manager with the #Nats. A true gentleman, a baseball hero of mine as a kid in #Cincinnati, and an All Star who broke so many barriers.
RIP to a true great: Frank Robinson. A #Cincinnati @Reds hero. MLB’s first African-American manager w/ the #Cleveland @Indians. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Honor. He was a true civil rights pioneer on &amp; off the field. He'll be greatly missed. https://t.co/mle0E5GSCx
Great to be on @Varneyco this morning to talk about my support for @POTUS’ border security proposal, which funds the top 10 priorities laid out by gov’t border security experts. https://t.co/kgmejyICNo
The Section 232 law is a vital trade remedy but when misused it can hurt our workers &amp; our economy. My bipartisan Trade Security Act will ensure this tool is reserved for legitimate national security threats. https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V
It’s my honor &amp; privilege every year to nominate a number of Ohio’s top young achievers for entry into one of our nation’s service academies. I encourage all interested students to attend one of the 17 service academy seminars I co-host w/ @SenSherrodBrown https://t.co/kgmejyICNo
Great discussion and smart questions on immigration, border security, E-Verify, the economy, prescription drug prices, infrastructure &amp; more tonight on our tele townhall with constituents from central #Ohio. https://t.co/zFNR1Vm0Xj

I’ve repeatedly expressed concerns about misuse of Section 232 to impose tariffs on autos &amp; auto parts &amp; its impact on #Ohio #jobs &amp; economy as whole. I urge my colleagues to pass my bipartisan Trade Security Act to ensure this trade tool is used properly https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V
My bipartisan Trade Security Act will reform Section 232 to preserve this trade remedy tool while ensuring that the Department of Defense justifies the national security basis for any new tariffs under this law. https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V
We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable, but we must do so in a way that protects American #jobs and strengthens our economy.  That’s why I introduced my bipartisan Trade Security Act today.  https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V
Introduced bipartisan legislation today w/ @SenDougJones @SenJoniErnst @SenAlexander @SenFeinstein @SenatorFischer @SenatorSinema &amp; @SenToddYoung to reform our national security tariff process #jobs https://t.co/eSzDB1Xu3V

Hundreds of birds migrate through #Ohio each year, making it one of the top destinations for birding. Protecting &amp; preserving these bird populations is critically important and I’m proud of my work with @SenatorCardin on this important bipartisan legislation. https://t.co/xYRSatsrx2
Many Dems also say new barriers should be based on expert advice on the placement and the type of structure. That’s what @POTUS’ plan does. #SOTU
An agreement is totally within reach with both @POTUS &amp; Democrats now agreeing that southern border needs more agents, more technology &amp; drones, more humanitarian assistance, more immigration judges &amp; better screening at ports of entry to stop the flow of drugs.
that is drawn up by gov’t experts, and embraced by the last two annual congressional spending bills on a bipartisan basis.
Good that @POTUS outlined a comprehensive plan to strengthen border security, but I wish he would emphasize that the new barriers are based on the top 10 priorities of the Border Security Improvement Plan...
.@POTUS rightly highlighted the economic progress we’re making and the role of #taxreform. 304K new #jobs last month &amp; strongest wage growth since the Great Recession. Real progress but we must continue our work to ensure opportunity for all Americans. #SOTU #Ohio
Agree with @POTUS’ call for unity tonight, especially his message that we should “govern not as two parties but as one nation.” I’m committed to working with all my colleagues to continue delivering results for #Ohio &amp; our country. #SOTU #Ohio

My bill improves E-Verify and makes sure all employers are using it. https://t.co/ExvPJj4Xja
E-Verify should provide a simple &amp;  reliable way for employers to confirm whether a new employee is here legally. Unfortunately the current optional program fails to eliminate the #job magnet and allows too many people to use fraudulent documents.
Great Q&amp;A w/ Senator @ChuckGrassley on the importance of passing my End Government Shutdowns Act. I’m thankful for his support &amp; the support of the 30 other Senators who agree, the time is now to end government shutdowns. https://t.co/hGaqVMS0I8

Over the last 2 yrs the Senate has confirmed 85 judicial nominees, including 30 circuit court judges &amp; 2 on #SCOTUS. All of this was made more difficult because of Democrats using the Senate procedures to require hours and hours of debate on even some non-controversial judges.

I’ve said repeatedly throughout this process that government shutdowns are a bad idea &amp; introduced legislation to end government shutdowns for good. We’ve already gained 18 cosponsors for my legislation &amp; I will strongly push for its inclusion in any final government funding bill
Thank you @ChuckGrassley for saying: “The final package should also end government shutdowns once and for all.” Completely agree. The End Government Shutdowns Act should be in any final funding bill. https://t.co/BInqB2aVPt
The announcement today is consistent with the letter that I worked on with a group of Republicans &amp; Democrats last week that outlined a process for reopening the government in the short term with the commitment to a border security plan that can be enacted in the next few weeks
https://t.co/J5pFPUHkVz
I support the approach @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has outlined for a 3 week CR. For the last several weeks I’ve worked w/ colleagues on both sides to reopen the gov’t &amp; address the need for additional border security. I believe this is a fair &amp; reasonable step forward.
It’s time to stop using government shutdowns as political leverage &amp; work together to solve these issues. https://t.co/k6gOfOyJlw

In the inspiring words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “That old law about 'an eye for an eye' leaves everybody blind. The time is always right to do the right thing” Let us remember the life &amp; legacy of a great man on #MLKDay and also recommit ourselves to being the best we can.

Govt shutdowns inevitably cost taxpayers more money once the govt reopens. Moving forward, we should end government shutdowns for good &amp; I’ve introduced legislation with my colleagues to do just that, providing lawmakers with more time to reach a responsible resolution.
ICYMI: Last week I joined @SquawkCNBC and urged my colleagues to come to an agreement on border security. I also highlighted the current strength of the economy that has been made possible due to pro-growth policies like #taxreform &amp; regulatory reform. https://t.co/MaCSSbKdcp

https://t.co/XQFqR7zFAT

January is National Slavery &amp; Human Trafficking Prevention month. In this century, women, men, and children should not be subjected to this horrific crime &amp; I will continue to help lead efforts in Congress to stop it. #EndTrafficking
Best wishes to @OSUCoachMeyer in his last game with @OhioStateFB. What better way to go out than with a W in the #RoseBowl. Thanks for your leadership Coach!
Happy New Year! Wishing you and yours a happy and healthy 2019!
Happy New Year’s Eve! So many great option across #Ohio to ring in the New Year! Where do you plan to countdown to 2019? https://t.co/vfwgLTTjv0
Over the past decade we have made progress in combating human trafficking. Am proud to have led efforts in Congress to enact #SESTA this year to curb online trafficking but there much more to do to end this scourge once and for all. https://t.co/Qi1nP5Oeyw
I want to thank @SenBobCorker for his tireless &amp; courageous efforts to combat modern slavery around the globe. I’m honored he has entrusted me with this leadership role &amp; I will continue my work to end this scourge once &amp; for all. https://t.co/Qi1nP5Oeyw

Yesterday #POTUS signed into law my bipartisan legislation to renew &amp; strengthen the Second Chance Act, which I first authored more than a decade ago in the House. It is making a difference across #Ohio by helping former inmates become productive members of society.
In a joint op-ed with w/ @SenSherrodBrown, we called on @GM to invest in the highly productive #Lordstown plant instead of shuttering the doors. https://t.co/LFiTHbR6mM
I’ve introduced legislation called End Government Shutdowns Act to ensure that we don’t have shutdowns going forward. They always cost taxpayers more and create unnecessary problems. I will continue to push to make that legislation the law of the land.
I am disappointed parties haven't already come together to avoid a shutdown. There’s no reason we can’t both strengthen our border security &amp; keep the government open. I am talking to all sides to find a way forward.
Pleased my bipartisan bill promoting conservation &amp; reducing greenhouse gas emissions just passed the #House. It will help us build stronger relationships w/ other countries while ensuring our natural resources are protected. Expect  POTUS to sign in the coming days.
The #Senate passed @SenatorShaheen and my bipartisan legislation that will protect the environment by promoting the re-refining of used oils &amp; other lubricants. The Re-refining industry creates #jobs and is energy efficient. https://t.co/mT4qodZ31Z
The Second Chance Act helps former inmates create their own future as opposed to being held back from mistakes of their past. It has already changed thousands of lives across #Ohio and the country. I’m proud it is now the law of the land. https://t.co/XEIlZRzfVl
https://t.co/XEIlZRzfVl
Today @POTUS signed my bipartisan Second Chance Reauthorization Act I led with @SenatorLeahy as part of criminal justice reform. This bill is critical to our efforts to stop the revolving door of incarceration &amp; help former inmates live up to their God-given potential.

Americans pay bills, grocery shop &amp; handle their banking online, why should dealing with the federal government be any different? I applaud @POTUS for signing my bipartisan 21st Century IDEA Act into law which will help to improve citizen’s interactions w/ the federal govt online
A bipartisan bill I led w/ several of my colleagues promoting conservation &amp; reducing greenhouse gas emissions passed the #Senate. It will help us build stronger relationships w/ other countries while ensuring our natural resources are protected. https://t.co/IccR4skgup

I’m humbled by the support @SenatorCardin and my bipartisan Retirement Security &amp; Savings Act has received from key stakeholders who support bipartisan reforms to help Americans save more for retirement and increase their 401(k)s. https://t.co/lNq3yDuUdF
Since the 2001 Portman-Cardin bill became law, 401(k) and other DC plan assets have increased by 179% and savings in IRAs have more than tripled.  U.S. retirement savings have increased from $11.3 trillion in 2001 to $28.3 trillion today. But we have much more to do.
The 2001 Portman-Cardin measure more than doubled contribution limits to IRAs, allowed portability between different types of retirement plans &amp; allowed older workers to make catch-up contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs.  https://t.co/lNq3yDuUdF
The legislation builds on the previous success @SenatorCardin &amp; I have had in authoring major reforms to enhance the retirement system as members of the House of Representatives that became law in 1996, 2001, and 2006.  https://t.co/lNq3yDuUdF
My bipartisan Retirement Security &amp; Savings Act will help to increase Americans’ savings in IRAs and workplace savings plans, expand coverage, and simplify retirement plan rules so Americans can enjoy a financially secure retirement. https://t.co/lNq3yDMv5d
Americans work hard to support themselves &amp; their loved ones, they shouldn’t have to struggle to save for retirement. That’s why @SenatorCardin &amp; I have introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen American’s retirement security. https://t.co/lNq3yDuUdF
Senator @DeanHeller is a good friend &amp; it was a privilege to work with him. He is a dedicated public servant &amp; his presence will be missed here in the #Senate. https://t.co/OvpxLzpLfx

Thank you to @SenatorLeahy for your hard work &amp; partnering w/ me to get the Second Chance Reauthorization Act passed. This legislation will go a long way in helping former inmates break the cycle of incarceration so that they can achieve their God-given potential.

I penned a joint op-ed w/@SenSherrodBrown for @FoxBusiness calling on @GM to change on #Lordstown &amp; bring new production to the plant. The workers deserve the chance to once again show GM what they can do. https://t.co/ecTLfJhc4P

In my letter to @GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this week, I pressed for answers on the future of the #Lordstown plant &amp; the future of the workers who have given so much to @GM. GM must recommit the workers of the Mahoning Valley! https://t.co/q4nqoDvfmo
For more than 5 decades, the #MahoningValley has been loyal to @GM &amp; now GM must stand by the Mahoning Valley.  I will continue to fight for these #Ohio workers and urge GM to bring new production to this award-winning plant. https://t.co/V266wEwsVi

After our investigation, this drug company has now decided to reduce the price of its Naloxone drug from $4,100 per unit to $178. This is a positive step, and I’ll continue to work to lower prescription drug prices https://t.co/3rHAFNm3kG #Ohio
Access to the life-saving overdose reversal drug naloxone is imperative now more than ever. We investigated one drug manufacturer that increased the price of its naloxone drug by more than 600 percent in just 2 ½ years, costing taxpayers more than $142M https://t.co/3rHAFNm3kG
We must hold the government of Saudi Arabia accountable for its actions and support an end to the conflict in Yemen. That’s why I strongly support the resolution authored by Chairman @SenBobCorker: https://t.co/V1hFu4VVAZ
There is no doubt that the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship is important to our national security &amp; economic interests, but I believe we must send a message to the administration that we need a stronger response on this issue https://t.co/V1hFu4VVAZ
Just as the Mahoning Valley has stood by @GM over the years, @GM should stand by the Mahoning Valley &amp; give Lordstown workers a chance instead of shuttering the plant’s doors for good. I will continue to fight for the Lordstown workers &amp; their #jobs. https://t.co/IZ5d26kBuA #ohio
Last week, in a meeting with @GM CEO Mary Barra, I urged her to consider moving one of the 20 electric vehicle models @GM is planning to build to the #Lordstown plant. This workforce has proved themselves &amp; deserves to have the plant remain open. https://t.co/IZ5d26kBuA #Ohio

We have the best workers in the world in #Ohio, and I’m proud of the workers at Lordstown. They make a great product, and the UAW made concessions there. We have proven ourselves time and again. Let’s put the new product in Lordstown, @GM.
We can and should do more to ensure more cars are made in #Ohio and America, and that’s what the new tax law actually does by incentivizing companies to invest and create jobs here.
In addition, lowering our corporate tax rate to 21% actually makes doing business in the United States far more competitive, especially compared to Mexico’s 30% corporate rate.
This incentive should reduce the tax cost to the investments that would likely need to be made to the plant to bring in a new vehicle there.
Under the tax law, companies making capital expenditures are now able to deduct 100% of the cost of those investments in year one instead of having to follow complicated depreciation schedules over many years.
I’m hopeful that @GM will make a wise decision and utilize the tax law’s benefits of immediate expensing and a lower rate to retool the Lordstown plant and bring a new vehicle there.
We’ve seen countless multinational companies responding to this new level playing field by bringing jobs and investment back into the U.S. in response to the new tax law.
The new tax law was designed to encourage companies to bring back jobs and investment to the U.S. through a competitive corporate rate and our new international tax system &amp; it’s having a positive effect on our economy.
In fact, the opposite is true. Through a lower corporate rate and immediate expensing, the tax bill incentivizes companies to invest in the U.S. and would help GM bring a new vehicle to the Lordstown plant.
I’m disappointed in @GM’s decision to shut down the Lordstown plant because the Chevy Cruze was not selling well. To be clear, this decision has absolutely nothing to do with the new tax law.
Great to sit down with my good friend Senator-elect @MittRomney this afternoon. I’m excited to work with him next year &amp; I know he will make the great state of #Utah proud. https://t.co/koS7AsZFkc

Hardworking taxpayers shouldn’t have to struggle to get answers from the #IRS, which is currently not the case. That’s why I introduced the Taxpayer Protection Act to reform the #IRS &amp; make it more responsive &amp; accountable to taxpayers.  https://t.co/sc8fWJjBJU

When I was elected to the Senate, Senator McCain would jokingly introduce me to reporters as “the jerk who played Obama.” I was proud to honor my friend &amp; colleague on the @SenateFloor this afternoon. Here is my full tribute: https://t.co/hT5QkdUxGs
During @SenJohnMcCain '08 presidential campaign, I served as a stand in for then-Senator Obama in debate prep. It was my job help him prepare &amp; get under his skin, and I did. Needless to say, he wasn’t happy with me during those debate sessions. https://t.co/hT5QkdUxGs
A @Navy Captain, Congressman, &amp; U.S. Senator, @SenJohnMcCain was first and foremost a patriot. Throughout his whole life—and very prolific life—he lived the motto of his 2008 presidential campaign, which was simply, ‘Country first.’ https://t.co/hT5Qkec8y0

20 years ago the American people had lost faith in the #IRS &amp; sweeping changes were needed to get the agency back on track. In my @CNBC op-ed, I lay out why it’s time to reform the #IRS once again. https://t.co/RkIG5py3yt
In an op-ed for @CNBC that I co-wrote w/ former Senator Bob Kerrey we discuss why the time is now for #IRS reform in order to help make the agency more responsive &amp; accountable to taxpayers. https://t.co/RkIG5py3yt

Until #Russia ends their illegal seizure of #Crimea, the US must continue to enforce our strict sanctions. I applaud #Senate Foreign Relations for passing my resolution this week strongly condemning #Russia’s illegal occupation. The US stands with #Ukraine https://t.co/Z3FZm9QsNi
My Permanent Subcmte on Investigations released a bipartisan report highlighting some federal agencies have not accurately reported their federal spending as required by the #DATAAct. This is unacceptable &amp; we have offered recs to get them back on track https://t.co/vII0SAJof2
Tune in tomorrow morning to @MeetThePress as I discuss #Kavanaugh for #SCOTUS, #Russia, and more! #IfItsSunday
In @Troydailynews I discuss why I support Judge #Kavanaugh. He’s  a widely respected legal scholar &amp; more importantly, a good man. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing him for 15+ years. No one better  qualified for #SCOTUS. https://t.co/oVxYaAIJoy
Great roundtable today in #Akron #Ohio with @SummaHealth &amp; @UnitedWaySummit to discuss their emergency room Pilot Opiate Overdose Program which was made possible due in part to funding I helped secure in the bipartisan #CURES legislation. https://t.co/3AiyBYdgVC

Proud to participate in the ribbon cutting for the new firing ranges at  @910AW this morning. I pushed to secure funding in the 2016 #NDAA to ensure that our #Youngstown reservists have the training they need to carry out their operations. https://t.co/U0Cc1awAlU
Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor honoring two brave Capitol Police Officers, Jacob Chestnut &amp; Detective John Gibson, who gave their lives in the line of duty when a gunman opened fire in the US Capitol 20 years ago. May their heroic efforts never be forgotten. https://t.co/G9GgBOhFZ0

Today I introduced bipartisan legislation that will restore staffing levels at Union Terminal in #Cincinnati as well as other major @Amtrak stations across the country. https://t.co/S8deRopUL9
My bipartisan #CTE bill passed the #House yesterday and is now on the way to @POTUS to be signed into law. This legislation will help students get the career &amp; technical education they need, regardless of economic standing, to pursue their American dream. https://t.co/z9rVCMFbOS
It has been 20 years since the last significant #IRS reform, and it is time to update the agency once again. The bipartisan Protecting Taxpayers Act will restructure &amp; reform the #IRS to make it more responsive &amp; accountable to the needs of taxpayers https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8
Too often, the federal government isn’t responsive to the needs of the people it serves, and the #IRS has not always served the interests of taxpayers. That’s why I introduced the Protecting Taxpayers Act today to reform the #IRS https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8
This morning, I will chair an @GOPSenFinance subcmte hearing on #IRS reform solutions. Proud to intro legislation with my colleague @SenatorCardin today to make the #IRS more responsive &amp; accountable to taxpayers https://t.co/HPdfaNKJQ8

25 IG Reports reviewed by the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, found more than half of the data submitted to https://t.co/UMjVr23JIA from fed. agencies – about $240 bill in spending – was inaccurate. This is unacceptable: https://t.co/vII0SAJof2
In the @highlandcopress I discuss how Judge #Kavanaugh is a legal scholar who respects the Constitution and won’t legislate from the bench. He’s a good man and who should be confirmed for #SCOTUS to address issues that affect #Ohioans &amp; Americans. https://t.co/qVRca9Vlkl
On @MSNBC earlier today I discussed my bipartisan #SESTA law that helps ensure justice for victims of online sex trafficking. Contrary to claims by some, selling women &amp; children online is not constitutionally protected speech. https://t.co/8b3OgY3m8v
Today marks 20 years since a gunman entered the Capitol &amp; killed Capitol Police Officers Jacob Chestnut &amp; John Gibson.

As Judge #Kavanaugh's Harvard Law students will tell you, his loyalty lies w/ the Constitution. He interprets the law &amp; Constitution  without imposing his own point of view. More in my op-ed for @TheDailyCall: https://t.co/YsTGSohKea
I recently met with Judge #Kavanaugh and saw the compassion, humility, big heart &amp; readiness to serve of the friend I’ve known for 15+ years. I can’t imagine a more qualified nominee for #SCOTUS. https://t.co/srT0SgQXiI
The #Senate passed my bipartisan bill to strengthen career &amp; technical education earlier today. This bill will help #Ohioans get the training they need for today’s jobs, regardless of economic standing https://t.co/N6onjz251M
I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into https://t.co/UMjVr23JIA to date, but we must continue to hold agencies accountable for providing accurate spending data.  More on my bipartisan report here: https://t.co/SFHBa4jkGy
A functioning https://t.co/UMjVr23JIA will improve transparency &amp; help policymakers identify &amp; eliminate gov. waste. My report today outlines recs to improve data submissions by federal agencies &amp; give policymakers &amp; the public the information they deserve https://t.co/vII0SAJof2

This weekend I had the opportunity to tour the beautiful @CVNPNPS &amp; see firsthand the maintenance needed. My Restore Our Parks Act will allocate funding for the park &amp; the 7 other #Ohio #NationalParks to address this long-term maintenance backlog. https://t.co/EW6eMYlIDa
My bipartisan Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act was created to protect the surviving spouses of servicemembers who have died during their military service. Great read in @IrontonTribune about how this bill will aid military spouses: https://t.co/lrUzfLdGi9
It’s a fact: Judge #Kavanaugh is an immensely qualified, highly respected judge &amp; most importantly, he’s a good man with a big heart. He is the right nominee for #SCOTUS and I’m proud to support his confirmation. https://t.co/f4Nky6Hkgx
Earlier this week the Department of @ENERGY transferred 80 acres of land to the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative in #Piketon. This will encourage development and have a positive economic impact on the region.
According to @MissingKids a leading national antitrafficking group: Many sites or portions of sites where NCMEC knew children previously had been sold for sex have voluntarily shut down. Good news that demonstrates how my bipartisan #SESTA is working to help end human trafficking

@SenateFloor https://t.co/okvdGoeSVv
A few flakes of #fentanyl can kill a person; unfortunately accidental overdoses are at an all time high. I spoke on the @SenateFloor about my bipartisan #STOPAct which will gives law enforcement the tools they need to help stop the influx of this poison in our communities
According to @MissingKids, a leading anti-trafficking group in the country, “there has been a major disruption in the online marketplace” since #SESTA was enacted &amp; “it is much harder to purchase a child online.” That’s great news. And that’s exactly what we intended #SESTA to do
Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor in order to provide an update on my bipartisan #SESTA law. #SESTA is already making a difference in reducing online sex trafficking, and multiple known websites that facilitated trafficking have been shut down! https://t.co/Bpu4nwDP9p

At @GOPSenFinance hearing yesterday I urged @CBP to use my bipartisan #ENFORCEAct in order to crack down on illegal trade instead of Section232 which should only be used in matters of national security. Misuse of 232 could result in #tradewars w/our allies https://t.co/qfQMlneHvn

According to a study done by @CDCgov, the chances of becoming addicted to #opioids increase dramatically by the 4th day of use. My bipartisan #CARA2, which builds upon my #CARA legislation, will reduce opioid RXs to only 3 days in effort to combat #opioidaddiction
I hope #POTUS takes this opportunity to make clear to President Putin face-to-face that Russia’s actions to interfere in our elections are unacceptable and that Russia’s behavior must change if it hopes to have improved relations with the US.

The United Kingdom is a significant ally and strategic partner, as well as #Ohio’s fourth largest export market. We absolutely should reaffirm that relationship with a mutually-beneficial trade agreement. #Jobs
I spoke on the @SenateFloor this afternoon about #SCOTUS nominee Judge #Kavanaugh. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing him  personally for 15+ years. His experience &amp; qualifications humility &amp; big heart are why I support his nomination to serve on the Court https://t.co/TLS1N9cqUx

Since December 2017, the economy has grown, wages are up and  #Ohio unemployment has fallen. All positive news in the six months since #taxreform was enacted! See how else #taxreform is benefitting our nation and especially #Ohio: https://t.co/6hiNxfxL1p #jobs
Barrie Barber was a smart, hardworking, and courteous reporter whose depth of knowledge about defense issues, especially as they relate to the Dayton area, will be hard to match. I will certainly miss his dedication to his profession and the community he served.
On Monday, the #Senate will pass an impt bill w/ key #Ohio priorities, including more funding to (1) combat the #opioidcrisis through #CARA, (2) protect Lake Erie; (3) fully fund #Piketon cleanup &amp; (4) upgrade our capabilities at #WrightPatt &amp; #CampRavenna

Great to see the House of Representatives pass bipartisan legislation to address the #opioidcrisis today. Now the Senate must act quickly so we can send a strong bill to @POTUS’ desk for him to sign. #STOPAct #CARA2 #Ohio
Yesterday @POTUS signed the National Vets Memorial &amp;Museum Act into law designating the National Vets Memorial &amp;Museum in #Columbus #Ohio. Im grateful for the services &amp;sacrifices of our vets &amp; I’m proud that #Columbus #Ohio is home to this important venue https://t.co/KKokenXmHj
As my Permanent Subcmte on Investigations report showed, @HHS &amp; @DHS are not equipped to handle this influx of unaccompanied minors. Congress must act to protect these children &amp; ensure they show up to their immigration hearings. See the report here: https://t.co/MUwtpfjhqT
We can keep families together &amp;have strong border security. On the @SenateFloor I highlighted the Keep Families Together &amp;Enforce the Law Act &amp;urged Congress to work together to find a compassionate solution that also upholds our country’s immigration laws https://t.co/NnzyNWH5Tp

According to an #Ohio Chamber of Commerce survey from May: 70% of businesses added employees in the first 3 months of the year and 75% said they plan to hire this quarter. And that’s just one benefit of #taxreform: https://t.co/6hiNxfg9CP #jobs #Ohio

Today marks one year since Otto Warmbier passed away, another reminder of the evil nature of the North Korean regime. Jane and my thoughts are with Fred, Cindy, and the entire Warmbier family who have been remarkably strong throughout this ordeal.
The admin should change course immediately and keep families together while their cases are expedited.  If they don’t, Congress should act quickly on a legislative solution and I’m working with my colleagues to do so. https://t.co/tvbLj0UsgL

Strong momentum behind the bipartisan #STOPAct to help combat the #opioidcrisis. House passed it last week. Making progress in the Senate &amp; the @washingtonpost ed board now supports the bill. “Opioids Come From China in the US Mail. Here’s How to Stop it.” https://t.co/GP2E8oMp5C

Following this summit I remain skeptical but hopeful that this new dialogue can translate into meaningful progress. #POTUS’ maximum pressure campaign must remain in place until #NorthKorea truly changes course &amp; ends its dangerous nuclear weapons program.
For nearly 18 months I worked to help secure the release of Otto Warmbier. Nearly one year ago, I joined Fred and Cindy Warmbier in #Cincinnati as they welcomed Otto home from #NorthKorea, and it’s a constant reminder to me about the evil nature of this regime.
I am hopeful that the negotiations can achieve these goals. In the past, however, #NorthKorea has used talks to stall while continuing its nuclear and missile programs.  Empty promises cannot buy any more time.
I have long called for a direct dialogue between the U.S. &amp; #NorthKorea, and I have supported this summit with the goal of achieving a peaceful solution that includes North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.
I’m urging the administration, along with a bipartisan group of 10 Senators, to release an @HHSGov study regarding what levels of certain chemicals are safe in drinking water. The @EPA is blocking the release of the results &amp; Americans deserve to know https://t.co/qHDTUyov6V

Going forward we now have the opportunity to fix the fundamental flaws of the #IranDeal and put in place a strong agreement that truly protects America’s national security interests and the interests of our allies in the region. https://t.co/FAfqlBYviA
My report outlines specific guidelines to ensure secret side deals like this never happen again, including requiring all administrations to disclose these licenses &amp; keep congressional committees up to date on the status of any future negotiations w/ #Iran https://t.co/FAfqlBYviA
The only reason the #Iran did not get access to the U.S. financial system was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the Obama administration asked them to help convert the money.  https://t.co/FAfqlBGTU0
Despite claims by the Obama Administration both before and after the #IranDeal that the US financial system would remain off limits, a specific license was issued by the administration allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars using our financial system https://t.co/FAfqlBYviA
Today as Chair of the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations I unveiled a report detailing how the Obama admin misled the American people&amp;Congress by secretly authorizing the conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of US dollars using our financial system https://t.co/FAfqlBYviA
Our courageous American soldiers stormed the beaches of #Normandy 74 years ago today in a pivotal battle which would help turn the tide of WWII in favor of the allies and become known as #DDay, a day America will never forget. https://t.co/2fTcZLHrs8
Today marks 74 years since our brave soldiers landed on the shores of #Normandy for Operation Overlord, otherwise known as #DDay. We owe our WWII vets a debt of gratitude and respect for their courage and bravery on this monumental day.

Nobody can compete with American workers, American companies, and American ingenuity on a level playing field. All we are asking for is that level playing field—and a chance for #Ohio workers to compete. More from my ITC testimony here: https://t.co/LL7GgkuX75

There is a reason Barbara Bush was one of the most popular people in America. She was dignified, straightforward, and funny, and always well intentioned. She spoke her mind freely, and when she did most of us nodded our heads in agreement https://t.co/NF2TwexchS
One of only two women in history who was both First Lady and the mother of a president, Barbara Bush used her influence to help others, including  empowering people through literacy. https://t.co/NF2TweONGs
Jane and I were blessed to get to know Barbara Bush when I worked for President George H.W. Bush in the White House and she has been a friend ever since. Here is my full statement: https://t.co/NF2TweONGs

Across #Ohio I’ve met with more than a dozen businesses who are all responding positively to the pro-growth changes in our new #TaxReform law. This #TaxDay businesses across #Ohio are raising wages, delivering bonuses, hiring new people, and reinvesting in their employees.
Thanks to #TaxReform, an #Ohio family of four at the median income level can expect to save about $2,000 a year on their taxes. These savings will make a real difference. What plans do you have for your savings?
In January, thanks to the #TaxReform law, the IRS updated the amount it withholds from employee paychecks and as a result, 90% of Americans are getting a bigger paycheck and more take-home pay. Hardworking #Ohioans are taking home more money every pay period! #TaxDay
This #TaxDay is the last time American’s will use the antiquated, 30+ year old tax system. Thanks to #TaxReform, we are moving forward with a new #TaxCode that is already expanding opportunity, creating more #jobs &amp; increasing wages for American workers. https://t.co/fWYRUbgRps
My bipartisan Promoting Hydropower Development &amp; Jobs Act will streamline permitting for hydropower projects and promote hydropower at existing non-powered dams. This will help to create more #jobs and promote clean energy. https://t.co/rxSsxtePgW (2/2)
Did you know: There are more than 50,000 suitable non-powered dams across the country that collectively have the potential to add 12 gigawatts of hydropower capacity? That's enough power to illuminate 1.2 trillion LED lightbulbs! (1/2)

We’ve waited for this day a long time and a mini-blizzard of snow is not going to stop the U.S. Senate from passing #SESTA today.
The Sacremento court opinion called for changes to #CDA230 like those in #SESTA to ensure justice for victims of online sex trafficking. This is why we must pass #SESTA. To ensure justice. https://t.co/1agTJgoqSX
Last year, a Sacramento judge cited the broad immunity provided by the Communications Decency Act in dismissing  charges against Backpage. We must act to give these victims the justice they deserve. https://t.co/1agTJgG2hx #SESTA
Let’s pass #SESTA to provide these victims the justice they deserve. My speech tonight on the Senate floor: https://t.co/1agTJgG2hx

Right now there is an absence of justice as those who have been trafficked online only see the websites that knowingly facilitated it prosper and escape legal consequences. That has to stop. We need to pass #SESTA https://t.co/FjfWkzuqpN
Justice cannot be seen but its absence can be felt. And that’s what’s happening now, an absence of justice. #SESTA is the online sex trafficking solution victims and their families need and courts have called for https://t.co/FjfWkzuqpN

I hope Congress can protect the #DACA population AND provide for needed border security. The American people want results. Rs &amp; Ds should work together to make this happen.
#TaxReform is working. #Ohio workers are beginning to see more in their paychecks, and companies are investing in America, not foreign countries. https://t.co/NoLKApHRYc

Yesterday's indictment of 13 Russian nationals &amp; three Russian entities for interfering in the 2016 presidential election was a positive step toward holding #Russia accountable. The American people deserve answers.
#Russia has been attempting to undermine our democracy for decades. And they will continue to do so. We must not lose sight of the bigger picture, &amp; take serious steps to combat their propaganda and disinformation campaigns.
The #STOPAct is a no-brainer to help keep these drugs out of our communities. Congress must act: https://t.co/7ZrfqtkHfd
Congress must act to close the loophole that lets drug traffickers exploit the Postal Service to send deadly drugs like fentanyl from #China to the U.S.: https://t.co/T4Jy93FGei
#TaxReform is creating more opportunities for families in Marietta and across #Ohio. My latest op-ed via @MariettaTimes: https://t.co/McOo9pe8sM
The negative impact on our economy, on #jobs &amp; our workers of having profits locked out of the U.S. makes no sense &amp; is why I fought to reform our international tax code. This announcement by @Cisco &amp; others is one of many indicators that #taxreform is working as intended
We must not forget that this is one small part of the larger process of understanding the extent of ongoing Russian disinformation &amp; influence operations against the United States and our allies. We must do more to counter foreign propaganda &amp; disinfo from #Russia &amp; others.
I’ve long said that the issue of Russian meddling in our presidential election must be investigated fully, and that the Special Counsel should follow the facts wherever they lead because the American people deserve to see all the facts. https://t.co/pzLZbQ0Lhq
Today's announcement that a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for interfering in the 2016 presidential election is a positive step towards holding #Russia accountable for its efforts to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/pzLZbQ0Lhq
My latest op-ed in the @dcexaminer: "Closing the Loophole That Lets Drug Traffickers Exploit the Postal Service" https://t.co/T4Jy93FGei #STOPAct
Drugs should not be as easy to ship as a postcard, and of all places, the U.S. Postal Service should not be the preferred conduit for drug trafficking. The #STOPAct is needed: https://t.co/T4Jy93o4PI
In 2016, more Americans died from drug overdoses than were killed during the entire Vietnam War. Last year was even worse. We have to keep deadly drugs out of our communities: https://t.co/T4Jy93FGei #STOPAct
Fitting tribute to two fallen heroes, Westerville Officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli. Today we mourn their loss, remember their courage, and thank them for wearing the badge to keep us safe: https://t.co/jpPgC6GYcW
Despite the Senate’s failure to make progress today, we still have a responsibility to act. We must protect those covered by #DACA &amp; provide for border security. This should be done on a bipartisan basis: https://t.co/7GFQnR6Cu2
Our proposal will provide a permanent solution to protect the #DACA population while also putting in place stronger border security measures: https://t.co/7GFQnR6Cu2
Today, w/ @SenJohnThune &amp; @JerryMoran, I introduced legislation to codify protections for the #DACA population &amp; to strengthen border security for all Americans. https://t.co/7GFQnR6Cu2
Heartbreaking news out of Florida. Jane and I send our prayers to the school, the community, and the victims of this tragedy.

When American workers look at their paychecks in coming weeks &amp; months, they will notice that less of their hard-earned money is going to Uncle Sam. That means more money for them to spend as they please: https://t.co/2QWf4Rwttz

The Pentagon’s latest National Defense Strategy highlights the harsh realities of the threats we face in the world &amp; the steps we need to take to confront them. We must invest in our men &amp; women in uniform and give them the tools they need now and in the future to do their jobs.
Pleased the president's budget proposes additional funding for Camp Ravenna and the @OHNationalGuard soldiers that train there: https://t.co/byD6UXWXlS

#NorthKorea is a vicious, brutal regime that systematically abuses the natural rights of its own citizens. It survives on total repression, fear &amp; propaganda. NK must be called out for what it is, and the West must not legitimize those who enable &amp; benefit from this cruel regime.
Thank you to the Warmbier family for reminding us of the brutality of the North Korean regime. https://t.co/AfibQQ3c7a
On Friday, the president signed into law legislation that provides $6 billion in funding over 2 years to help tackle the #opioidcrisis. This is a positive step, but more must be done: https://t.co/gQOIVoU3Wf
The #opioidcrisis is having a devastating impact on #Ohio communities, families, local budgets, the criminal justice system &amp; more. We must take a more aggressive role at the national level to help turn the tide.

There is clearly a legislative solution to keep fentanyl out of our communities. That is why I am urging the Senate to pass the #STOPAct: https://t.co/IfBXHeWhkp
Congress must act to defend U.S. businesses and counter efforts by international organizations like the UN to marginalize and discriminate against our ally #Israel. https://t.co/0WEruQMpES

The #opioidcrisis has unfolded in 3 different waves. First came the prescription drug epidemic, then came heroin, &amp; now synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The results have been deadly: https://t.co/jgtvk81Kbg

Jane and I were on the train this morning traveling to the House and Senate Republican Member retreat. We are both fine. We are keeping those who were injured in our prayers and are grateful for the first responders who quickly arrived on the scene.
Drug overdoses are now the number one cause of death, not just accidental death, for Americans under the age of 50. The reason? The spread of heroin &amp; prescription drugs, and now synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil. https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
In case you missed it, here is my response to last night’s State of the Union address. #SOTU https://t.co/46TGzM25Uy
As POTUS mentioned in his #SOTU speech, we are already seeing the benefits of regulatory relief &amp; the new #taxreform law. We know that more must be done. #Jobs
#POTUS tonight talked about the need to strengthen our job training programs and help those re-entering society from prison get a second chance. My #SecondChance Act will help. https://t.co/OaYlyKTd0M
I am hopeful about POTUS' message re: the #opioidepidemic. This is a crisis in #Ohio &amp; around the country. We must do more to keep drugs out of the U.S. &amp; get people the help they need. #SOTU https://t.co/tOH99MQZeA
Infrastructure permitting reform is important to creating #jobs. Glad to see #POTUS discussing its importance. We’re making progress on this through my 2015 bill to make permitting smarter &amp; more efficient.

There is a clear need for a legislative solution to help prevent fentanyl from entering our country through our own mail system. Urging my colleagues to pass the bipartisan #STOPAct: https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
There are now 174 Americans dying every day from drug overdoses. Up from 143 people in 2016 and 105 in 2010. Fentanyl is now the number one killer. We must do more to keep this deadly drug out of the U.S.: https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
On the Senate floor today, I highlighted the bipartisan and eye-opening PSI report that details how drug traffickers exploit vulnerabilities in our international mail system to ship fentanyl into the U.S.: https://t.co/Iitvah1K0X
Despite #NAFTA's benefits, we can do better. Modernizing NAFTA to increase market access, expand exports, and include new provisions on intellectual property and e-commerce will help #Ohio workers: https://t.co/7INPqfYvdh

The #opioidcrisis and the uptick in #humantrafficking are directly related. It will take a societal effort to help turn the tide of addiction and #endhumantrafficking, but the gov't has a role to play.
The @GLFOP &amp; @FOPofOhio's support for #SESTA &amp; their work to combat #humantrafficking is critical to helping end this heinous crime. https://t.co/mQEKVYKqph

How many more Americans have to die from fentanyl being shipped to drug  traffickers here in the U.S. before Congress acts to help keep these drugs out? https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h #opioidcrisis
Drug traffickers are receiving fentanyl at their front doorsteps, delivered to them by the U.S. mail system via China, with deadly results. https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h #opioidcrisis
The 500 payments we tracked accounted for $766 million in street value, 7 tragic deaths, including a 49 y/o Ohio man, and 6 online sellers all from the same country: China. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
Ordering fentanyl online was as easy as buying any other product online. We  identified more than 500 payments to online sellers by more than 300 Americans totaling $230,000, most of which occurred over the last two years. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
With a simple Google search, we discovered that it was shockingly easy to  get fentanyl. What’s more, we found out we could get it delivered,  through the U.S. mail,  right to our doorstep. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
In #Ohio, fentanyl &amp; its variations were involved in almost 60 percent of all overdose deaths in 2016. So @SenatorCarper &amp; I decided to dig deeper into the source of this deadly drug. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
Yesterday, @CBSThisMorning highlighted our report showing why Congress must act to keep fentanyl out of our communities. #STOPAct #opioidcrisis https://t.co/5oxRMmSRoj
Here’s a look at just some of the coverage on our bipartisan report:  https://t.co/MIWCDJg5Ht #opioidcrisis
In the stunning report I published w/ @SenatorCarper, we show how drug traffickers are exploiting our own mail system, with deadly results. https://t.co/ex5TkWNCrG
It is an outrage that Americans are dying due to fentanyl that is being shipped to the United States through the U.S. mail system from China. https://t.co/ZBQFLHtknf #opioidcrisis
On the #middleclass tax cuts, the proof will be in the paycheck. Every middle-class income group receives a tax cut: https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
Just a few weeks after the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act was signed into law, we’re already seeing real progress in helping create a better economy: https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
The American people deserve a thoughtful, nonpartisan report on Russia’s interference in our election. Must follow the facts wherever they lead: https://t.co/AHNxFWxPmY
The #opioidcrisis is being made worse because drugs are being shipped from China to drug traffickers here in the U.S. through our own mail system. Congress must act: https://t.co/oAcC8glxpW
The #opioidcrisis is getting worse, not better. On @CNN w/ @jaketapper, I discussed how Congress can act to help keep deadly drugs like fentanyl out of our communities: https://t.co/iLn5lwR20l
Will be live on @CNN with @jaketapper shortly. Talking today’s hearing on fentanyl &amp; the #opioidcrisis and more. https://t.co/nK1CbHsMUB
Thank you, Jonathan, for your service to our state &amp; our country. https://t.co/leTAqobmOJ
The vast majority of illegal fentanyl is purchased online from labs in China &amp; then shipped to the United States through the mail. Congress must pass the #STOPAct: https://t.co/jJ02eVjnRP #opioidcrisis
To watch my opening statement at the bipartisan hearing Combatting the #OpioidCrisis: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in International Mail, go here: https://t.co/jJ02eVjnRP
No more Americans should have to die before the federal gov’t gets its act together to help keep deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl out of our communities. https://t.co/jJ02eV1N0h #opioidcrisis
Our bipartisan hearing on “Combatting the #OpioidCrisis: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in International Mail” starts at 10am. You can watch live here: https://t.co/tZdPDFCNFa
My yearlong, bipartisan investigation w/ @SenatorCarper culminated in a report showing how fentanyl is shipped from China to drug traffickers here in the U.S., with deadly results. You can read the report here: https://t.co/ex5TkX5dje #opioidcrisis
Drug traffickers from China are exploiting vulnerabilities in our international mail system to easily ship deadly drugs like fentanyl into the U.S. This must stop. #opioidcrisis https://t.co/sJvVX3yoQU
.@CBSThisMorning highlighted my PSI investigation into the #opioidcrisis &amp; Chinese drug traffickers shipping fentanyl through the U.S. Mail: https://t.co/3NwD172xVP
Tomorrow, @SenatorCarper &amp; I will hold a hearing to reveal the details of our bipartisan investigation &amp; discuss policy recommendations resulting from our findings. Tune in tomorrow at 10am: https://t.co/tZdPDFCNFa #opioidcrisis
The federal government can, and must, act to shore up our defenses against this deadly drug and help save lives. Read our full report here: https://t.co/ex5TkWNCrG #opioidcrisis
Thanks to our bipartisan investigation, we now know the depth to which drug traffickers exploit our mail system to ship fentanyl &amp; other synthetic drugs into the U.S. from countries like China. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
Fentanyl is so powerful that just a few flakes of it can kill you, and those who use it not only put themselves in danger, but they also put law enforcement &amp; children at risk. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0 #opioidcrisis
In my home state of #Ohio, fentanyl is now the number one killer, surpassing heroin, prescription drugs, &amp; car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death. https://t.co/X5eGnsIdO0
Today, @SenatorCarper &amp; I released a stunning bipartisan report showing how drug traffickers exploit the international mail system to ship illegal opioids into the U.S. Read it here: https://t.co/ex5TkWNCrG

The #CHIP extension provides much needed certainty and stability to the #Ohio families who rely on it. Proud to support this long-term solution to fund children’s health care: https://t.co/QtgthYRKQN
The 6 year #CHIP extension signed into law last year is the longest extension of CHIP ever authorized. Great news for the families of 8.9 million American children &amp; 219,000 #Ohio children. https://t.co/QtgthYRKQN
On behalf of the Senate, I was proud to sign the bill to renew the #CHIP program for 6 years &amp; fund the government. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump - it's headed to you for signature! https://t.co/81Y3DdUK0z
Also as a result of #taxreform, the median-income family in #Ohio can expect to save about $2,000 a year as a result of these tax cuts. https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
Extending #CHIP for 6 years delivers long-term stability and certainty that families of 219,000 kids in #Ohio &amp; nearly 9 million nationwide deserve: https://t.co/G2mQHbFHwT
Critically, this bill provides a long-term funding solution for #CHIP. This six-year CHIP extension is the longest since the program was enacted more than 20 years ago. https://t.co/G2mQHbFHwT #Ohio
Gov’t shutdowns ultimately hurt our economy, hurt families, and hurt our troops. Pleased that a sufficient number of my Democratic colleagues joined Republicans in voting to re-open the federal gov’t today. #Ohio
One result of #taxreform is that more than 3 million Americans who have federal income tax liability will come off the tax rolls altogether. https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
In businesses in Youngstown and across #Ohio, we are already seeing the benefit of historic #taxreform: https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
We crafted the #taxreform bill w/ two goals in mind: #middleclass tax cuts &amp; business tax reform to help workers, businesses, &amp; our economy. https://t.co/fnaWXO5mqb
"#TaxReform is already paying off for residents of #Ohio, Youngstown." My op-ed in the @vindicator: https://t.co/fnaWXNNLyD
Check out this op-ed by @RameshPonnuru on why the Senate should pass my End Government Shutdowns Act: https://t.co/iQe4Lwuxgk
The past three days are proof of why government shutdowns must end. They help nobody. That is why I have introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act: https://t.co/Nf2PuA13sw
I’m pleased that Senate Democrats are working w/ Republicans to re-open the federal government. Shutdowns are unnecessary, counter-productive, &amp; often end up costing more taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/xPQLKjCP4U
Let’s re-open the government and let’s get back to work. My floor speech tonight:  https://t.co/LdGti77ewG
The Senate vote tonight will reauthorize #CHIP to help nine million children who need basic health care services, including 219,000 Ohio children. Let’s pass this bill.  https://t.co/LdGti7oPoe
This shutdown will hurt our economy, our families &amp; our troops. Urged my Democratic colleagues tonight to re-open the federal gov’t. https://t.co/LdGti7oPoe
Before the vote later tonight to re-open the federal government, I spoke on the floor to call on my colleagues to end this needless shutdown. https://t.co/LdGti77ewG
Good read in the @toledonews editorial board praising the new #taxreform law. Pleased they acknowledge the benefits that workers, families &amp; businesses are already seeing.  https://t.co/0ok6iB1pVg

I’ve been fighting to reauthorize the #CHIP program for months. This short-term funding bill reauthorizes it for six years, providing much-needed long-term stability for children in #Ohio https://t.co/2SXdQendu0
Ohio has the 10th largest #CHIP program, helping 219,000 #Ohio children get health coverage—and 9M children nationwide. Urging my Democratic colleagues to join me in reauthorizing this critical program https://t.co/J0bGrlYDO9
There’s nothing in this short-term funding bill that either party opposes. It keeps the gov’t running &amp; extends #CHIP, which helps low-income children in need. https://t.co/scAQts6V50 #SaveCHIP
Last night I voted to keep the gov’t open and provide long-term funding for the #CHIP program. Unfortunately almost every Democrat opposed this common-sense bill https://t.co/scAQts6V50 #SaveCHIP
Shutdowns are unnecessary and counter-productive, and I would hope Democrats reconsider their opposition to this non-controversial, short-term funding bill and work with us to keep the government running. https://t.co/uDAYCplimg
There’s nothing in this short-term funding bill that either party opposes, and no one benefits from a shutdown. We should end government shutdowns for good:  https://t.co/uDAYCplimg

Today, we have a choice. We can vote to extend this critical funding for our nation’s children, or we can continue to kick the can down the road &amp; create instability for these families in need. My choice is clear: #ExtendCHIP
This week, on the Senate floor, I continued my push for a long-term funding solution for #CHIP. This is a critical issue to me, the families of 219,000 #Ohio kids, &amp; the families of more than 9 million kids nationwide. #ExtendCHIP https://t.co/lNpdLxPxl1
In December, I called for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate to enact a long-term funding solution for #CHIP: #ExtendCHIP https://t.co/a9UWGSqb2L
In October, I, along with the entire Senate Finance Committee, voted to extend #CHIP funding: https://t.co/2KjQUsBtmC #ExtendCHIP
The economy is, thanks largely to #taxreform, improving rapidly. Shutting down the government is a step backwards. Urge all my colleagues to keep the gov’t open: https://t.co/oY2pVFegzr
There is nothing in this short-term funding bill that Democrats object to. In fact, it keeps the gov’t open &amp; extends CHIP for a historic 6 years, a top priority for both parties. https://t.co/uvUqFTDqGy
On @SquawkCNBC, I detailed why gov’t shutdowns are counter-productive &amp; unnecessary. Urging all my colleagues to keep the gov’t open &amp; support #CHIP: https://t.co/Khr3jRIUWI

It is urgent that the House &amp; Senate implement a long-term solution to #SaveCHIP. In a recent floor speech, I discussed how CHIP helps protect more than 200,000 #Ohio kids: https://t.co/Vla94GFdQ7
We should all want American businesses to be more competitive on the global stage. #TaxReform is making that a reality: https://t.co/rvThrCaw4S
All over the country, there are companies large &amp; small that have announced pay increases, or bonuses, or increased 401(k) contributions, or increased pension contributions, or new investments in equipment and technology b/c of #taxreform
I am calling on the Senate to take up  #SESTA this month. There is no time to waste. It is up to Congress to act before more victims are subject to trauma and sold online. #EndHumanTrafficking. https://t.co/skDX7koy64
I am thankful that we have organizations like the Collaborative to #EndHumanTrafficking in Cleveland, who I met with on Friday, working tirelessly to combat this crime. #SESTA will help them. https://t.co/71xLsZrS9V
#SESTA closes a loophole in federal law to hold accountable those who engage in sex trafficking and to finally give victims the justice they deserve. #ListenToSurvivors https://t.co/E9kLKbk27Z
#HumanTrafficking has moved from the street corner, to the smart phone. Tragically, evil websites like Backpage have taken advantage of an archaic 1996 law that allows them to operate with immunity. #SESTA
When most people I talk to learn that #humantrafficking is happening all over #Ohio &amp; this country, that young women &amp; children are being sold online for sex in this country, they are shocked. But that is the reality and why we need #SESTA
No shortage of things to do here in Cincinnati. I encourage everyone to come and visit and see for yourself! https://t.co/ZENJi0eYwi

This week the @USATODAY editorial board praised my bipartisan #STOPAct: "To catch mass killer, focus on fentanyl shipments." This is exactly what the STOP Act will do: https://t.co/txeSZKuvcE
This wk, POTUS signed into law the bipartisan INTERDICT Act to help combat the #opioidepidemic. This bill will ensure we get the needed funds for screening equipment, but more must be done. Senate must also take up #STOPAct to identify the shipments &amp; help keep fentanyl out.
Inspired by the courage of so many women who have stepped forward to make passage of #SESTA possible. At this rally, we talked about how we are getting closer to giving victims the justice they deserve: https://t.co/voFk5M1dJR
On the Senate floor, I detailed how #TaxReform is leading to higher paychecks, more investments in plant &amp; equipment, and more #jobs. https://t.co/rvThrCs6Wq
On top of these business incentives &amp; the beneficial results we are already seeing of more investment, workers &amp; families will also get individual tax cuts: @USTreasury says abt 90% of employees are abt to see less withholding from the paycheck &amp; more help for the family budget.
#TaxReform is good for American workers. More #jobs, better pay &amp; benefits, and better tools, including new technology &amp; equipment. And for workers competing w/ foreign companies, we leveled the playing field: they no longer have to compete w/ one hand tied behind their back.
I also heard abt how the new lower tax rates and immediate expensing is responsible for increased investments in workers, more investment in plant and equipment and more #jobs. #TaxReform
At Sheffer Corporation in Cincinnati, Wolf Metals in Columbus, and Tremco in Cleveland, I had town hall meetings w/ employees.
As part of my Results for the Middle-Class #TaxReform Tour, I am traveling the state meeting w/ #Ohio workers who are benefiting from the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act. #Jobs
#HumanTrafficking is increasing here in Cleveland as it has moved from the street corner to the smart phone. It will continue to increase unless Congress acts. Congress must pass #SESTA https://t.co/PtwzDPYp5G
I am grateful for the efforts of those I met w/ today to play a role in helping to stop these crimes, but Congress must act to give law enforcement the ability to go after those who sell women and children online for sex. #SESTA https://t.co/QOpBKPnhRZ
The horrific crime of #humantrafficking is occurring in communities throughout #Ohio and the U.S., often at hotels and motels. It is done w/ ruthless efficiency b/c of the internet. #SESTA is needed. https://t.co/Bj5u3b577S
