@butterflies8814 @WWEUniverse Yes. That’s awesome to hear, Karen!
Congrats on hitting a homerun &amp; winning your fight, #RomanReigns! Like the @WWEUniverse, I am thrilled to hear this fantastic news. https://t.co/2UBWzZ3uc6
MARITIMES https://t.co/lnS1nNbRmu
Excited to see @WWERomanReigns on #RAW tonight. The positive mental approach he’s taken towards his battle with leukemia has been incredibly inspiring. I personally can’t wait to see the #BigDog back inside a @WWE ring doing his thing.
@Skarsgrd2 Muchas gracias, Skarsgård.
@xnightwolf92x If given that opportunity, I SEIZE IT.
Happy Day of Birth to The Boy of the Nature, the Shoot GOAT, @RicFlairNatrBoy!   What a life, what a run.. Possibly the most wild &amp; incredible 70 years that any VESSEL could EVAH experience. https://t.co/KXwYpxBhRA

Pro wrestling in 2019 is primarily serving 2 different appetites.  If I’m creating a pro wrestling buffet, I want to provide both appetite’s favorite dishes.. But I also want to prepare those dishes in a way that the other appetite can still comfortably digest &amp; appreciate them.

Life will never be perfect, but if you live comfortably, are healthy &amp; happy.. Then there’s good things in your life.  Stop complaining about the unimportant, be grateful for the good, &amp; don’t be the person that doesn’t realize how good things were until they’re long gone.
@Lodi1Brad @ShaneHelmsCom @JEFFHARDYBRAND @joeyfromROH A blessed crew indeed! We were all chasing the dream &amp; having a blast doing so.
This poll helps me to decide my future. Thanks to all of you who have voted &amp; commented on my poll question. https://t.co/lVhJ95TPbZ
No matter the role, whether it was V1, Will Not Die, or even WOKEN, Arn Anderson was so good that he could assimilate &amp; translate that persona’s identity to in-ring work. And that’s on top of his hilarious personality &amp; storytelling.  Thanks, best wishes &amp; cya down the road, AA! https://t.co/AWeO5gdb8B
@TONYSILVATHE3RD @WWENetwork Choose one. Go with your gut feeling, your initial reaction. It’s exactly the same process that I’m currently engulfrd in.
@therealec3 REAL. I’m proof.
Watched S4 of @HouseofCards. I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I thought the season finale wasn’t as arresting as seasons 1-3.  Big surprise pop when Lucas shot Frank.  Also enjoyed Takeshi Kovacs as Conway. The insane political maneuvering is the funnest part of the series. https://t.co/PJtCSKn7sD

@mitchellpwtorch We weren’t, it was an old pic of us at The Dean Dome. Watched from The Compound. But we’ll see ya at TDD the next time we defeat the "bad guys".
@mitchellpwtorch The title isn’t representative of UNC being the villain, it’s merely to pay tribute to North Carolina’s history.  The Devils that are Blue, Duke, are truly the "bad guys". Right, @yesnicksearcy?
@mitchellpwtorch @DukeMBB @BarackObama @UNC_Basketball @GoHeels @RebyHardy @BABYHARDYBRAND I get it.. It’s trendy nowadays to boo the pushed, cool, winning babyface.

Can’t honestly say just one. The 1st @WWE Tag Title win was the realization of a dream. Was very proud to hold European, US, ECW &amp; TNA Titles for validation as a singles competitor.

@meanwoooodean No. But I get @MrChuckD’s words. The huge Social Media platform is PACKED with fiction &amp; not everyone can differentiate. ANYBODY can post without repercussion, even info that’s 100% false. And some commit &amp; play that role for SO long that it becomes real to them &amp; others.. CRAZY.

I am watching the @WWE Champion’s actions very closely.. As a matter of fact, I’ll be watching ALL of the @WWE titleholders very closely for the immediate future. #SDLive
YEEAAAAASSS!!! Congrats to the NEW @WWE U.S. Champion, @RonKillings! #SDLive
I'm positively flattered by your kind article, @VICESports, but please rewrite &amp; republish a few years down the road when I'm actually forced to step away from pro wrestling. Stubborn VESSELS like mine don't go away that easily.. https://t.co/EZzcUiCSuF

Strong #RoyalRumble event. Seth Rollins winning the match was most likely the best case scenario in #WWE’s big picture. He always delivers in top situations.  With that said, whenever I return to @WWE, I’ll be coming after whoever’s number one.  I’M COMING BACK FOR NUMBER ONE.
FIGHT, @JEFFHARDYBRAND, FIGHT! #RoyalRumble

@bigblackuncut No apology needed. It’s hard to fully &amp; clearly describe your thought sometimes when there’s a character limit. I enjoy good, healthy conversation. Best wishes, my man.
Textbook karma says the universe punishes those who are bad/cruel.  I’ve known people who’ve been bad, done bad things, but eventually realized they’re in the wrong &amp; must change. And they do w/o "karma". It’s the ones who don’t change that usually pay for their previous actions. https://t.co/gdaIWPdaQS
@bigblackuncut In theory, yes, I’m with ya. Pointing out when people can’t see the errors of their ways, it typically catches up to them. Some CAN see their errors, become accountable, create change &amp; become better. That’s the main separation I see between textbook karma &amp; the theory of karma.
I don’t necessarily believe in the textbook concept of karma.. But I do believe if you regularly make poor decisions and treat others unfairly and selfishly, those bad choices &amp; cruel behavior will ultimately catch up with you.

@AmericanSimonX Understand what you’re saying &amp; there’s merit to saying "enough" when situations go too far.  So much chaos has stemmed from the sensationalism of the media &amp; the loudest voices pushing their individual narrative, not a solution. Society needs to unity, not continue to divide.
@strikeromega @reillyhadden That is correct, Striker. It’s the same motion you would utilize to DELETE on a touchscreen, just much larger &amp; exaggerated.
In a world where so many have a voice, our society has to stop having animosity towards those who think, look, speak or live differently.  A person with a good heart and soul should always supersede any difference of opinion, race or belief.
How can anyone not love &amp; respect @reymysterio?  For a guy who has put his body through SO damn much for nearly 30 years, his skills as an athletic performer are positively MIND-BLOWING.  What a LEGEND. #SDLive

@JadedTLC @urlgrl @Twitter If you use Twitter correctly, don’t troll &amp; tweet with respect, it’s ok if you have an alias. I’m speaking out about those very people that WOULD &amp; DO harass you, they’re the INTERNET NOBODIES. I’m working to clean up the streets of Twitter so you can one day actually be you.
@esteevius @Twitter @yesnicksearcy I jokingly suggested the "INTERNET NOBODY" terminology be used for Twitter reports after using it earlier. These trolls exists to constantly nag public figures online, Nick included.. And Nick roasts them. Nick doesn’t seek out innocents, these trolls do. https://t.co/9qnNye4i4U
Hi @Twitter. My name’s Matt.  Could we add the term "INTERNET NOBODY" to the list of reasons to report accounts?  An INTERNET NOBODY is someone who’s only on social media, usually anonymously under a pseudonym, to troll &amp; harass the good people that use twitter correctly.  Thanks

@dom_draper101 What a coincidence, just watched this movie today. It was intriguing.
https://t.co/j0RwAQTSAx
@Deezovariez @haunting @netflix Agreed!
@CraigFerret @haunting @netflix Great reveal that I didn’t see coming.
@SeanRossSapp @haunting @netflix Seconded.
@HEELDanielle @haunting @netflix It really exceeded my expectations.
Finally watched The @Haunting of Hill House on @netflix. Heard it was receiving good reviews &amp; expected it to be a strong horror series. Was heavily impressed that it was not only a well-done, smart horror, but also told a great story across different time periods. Good stuff!
@MrStephenPike Understood. It’s currently a PANDEMIC.

It’s the "kind of finish" wrestlers in the 70s used, before the biz became SPOT-CENTRIC. Considering the show is based, and titled, on the 70s, it’s called continuity. https://t.co/dL97deQQo2

@TONYSILVATHE3RD Shannon was my understudy, ergo a Mattitude Follower (MFer). Crash was Shannon’s understudy, hence a Moore-On (Moron). Both @TheShannonBrand &amp; Crash were great in their roles &amp; down for doing anything to be entertaining &amp; fun. Crash was a hilarious guy.

Own your past. Your past is a fixed portion of your story, regardless of how you feel about it. Don’t dwell on "what ifs", use it as a learning tool. Focus on your present &amp; future, you currently control them.
@TONYSILVATHE3RD @RebyHardy @BABYHARDYBRAND @WolfieHardy @BenjaminSenor @JEFFHARDYBRAND @BethBrittHardy_ @Vanguard1AAR @Skarsgrd2 @BlessingsSilva @zombigrrrl With DISCIPLINE, DRIVE &amp; DEDICATION you can achieve nearly anything. It’s easy being healthy when your VESSEL is young, it’s naturally healthy &amp; resilient. As we age, so does the demand for VESSEL care &amp; maintenance. My body has been RAVAGED, but I train it EVERY DAY. Beat this.

@JANELABABY And BTW, get well soon, @JANELABABY.. Keep killin’ it out there!
@JANELABABY Super! I hear that from LOTS of people-about the match &amp; jumping off ladders thru tables. WM2000 was undoubtedly a SPECTACLE that had NEVAH been seen in the WWE realm. I loved this match, but WM17 was my favorite because I felt the strong psychology matched the INSANE SPECTACLE.
@MustafaAliWWE We had an advantage because we created &amp; ushered in the TLC genre. The 6 of us were doing INCREDIBLE things for the first time EVAH, which elicited the emotions/feelings from spectators that morphed into unforgettable memorie. Gotta be SO creative now to do original things.

@Rick_Wildfire @WWE @JEFFHARDYBRAND Welcome to my world, Rick. I’ve long realized that The Wizard of Oz sees me as The WICKED Hardy of the East..  I SHALL EMBRACE IT.

https://t.co/IH2fzEElLf
@hairywrestling @RealCurtisAxel My last @WWE match hasn’t happened yet, so this particular cycle shall be #BROKEN.. But I’m sure the DELIGHTFUL cycle of Hardys &amp; Hennigs doing battle shall continue in the future. https://t.co/GY0ou5nLU2
https://t.co/VhnIKZGol8
Why? Cuz I NEVAH got the respect or appreciation I deserved in @WWE.. No matter how much I contributed or how good I was, I was the red-haired stepchild Hardy of the family..  Regardless of my efforts, The Wizard of Oz always saw me as The WICKED Hardy of the East.. The 2nd best. https://t.co/0RkBSUFQw8
Trust me when I say this..  IT IS FAR FROM OVAH! https://t.co/x2MUoLFErV

These DASTARDLY GMs are abusing their positions &amp; power on #RAW.  This brand needs an EXTREME double dose of #WOKEN Mattitude.. Only 1 man can fix a #BROKEN #RAW.. and that’s Matt Hardy.
I am positively ECSTATIC to be representing @WWE #RAW this weekend at the WONDERFUL @walescomiccon!  See ya in a few days, mates! https://t.co/yEXFyfiaKN

So you’re asking ME, one of the athletes that valiantly took part in "this $h*t", if this is "REAL?"  Perhaps instead of questioning the intelligence of wrestling fans, you should question your own intelligence for tweeting such insulting ignorance.  #HaveCourageAndBeKind, right? https://t.co/TxpM6NaQxP

@KarlAndersonWWE The feeling is mutual, mi amigo.

@DJLunatikk Has nothing to do with this...but yes, I am aware. Not an anti-Enzo post, I got along with him.  With that said, how can you not find irony &amp; humor in the fact a female security guard was the 1st sent out to subdue a former male talent during the height of the Women’s Evolution?
@_HelenaDouglas @TuftsGuy @WWE With all due respect, please Google SATIRE. Have a great night, Helena.
@the90stalgia I was merely acknowledging the ONE MATCH, sweetheart. Please, BREATHE.. I don’t want you to have an aneurysm, you’re excessively worked up. I’m sure #SDLive will go OVAH strong when it draws all that "inspiration" from FOX.. And is actually on FOX. https://t.co/IAlISV5DL8
Lived up to my hopes. Great match, both brought their A game tonight. #SurvivorSeries https://t.co/3k50hgGmAS
I find this Brock vs Bryan match very INTRIGUING. #SurvivorSeries
I suggested to @JEFFHARDYBRAND to avoid Strowman &amp; McIntyre tonight at #SurvivorSeries.. Those 2 are both white hot right now, nearly impossible to beat. Great effort though, #BrotherNero!
@TuftsGuy @WWE The WWE is taking the Women’s Evolution very seriously, even on the security front. #SurvivorSeries

@throwing_sparks @JanetteKirchner Don’t be sad. All is good. We ultimately had a civil, adult conversation, which I respect &amp; enjoy. Know that I’m protective of my supporters-that includes you-if you still consider yourself in that category. The Twitterverse is a small world, take care &amp; seeya around.

@shinnox @StarWarsTiffany @StayCrossed @throwing_sparks Well said. Opinions need to be presented correctly. An "@" is irrelevant. It’s a public post, that someone voluntarily made available to the entire world, that contains content that is specifically about me &amp; my biggest supporters. A response is justifiably warranted.
CHOICES HAVE CONSEQUENCES.  You made the CHOICE to tweet the conversation starter &amp; it grew into this. I hope everyone learns &amp; takes away from this interaction.  Please do not harass or insult this individual, let’s all move on &amp; BE KIND to one another.  Signed, THE GREAT UNITER https://t.co/bfu6fYmHh3
@throwing_sparks @ViewFromTopRope I am not upset. I took you to task because I want you to be MINDFUL &amp; ACCOUNTABLE of what you say &amp; tweet. I appreciate &amp; respect those who support me, so I’m protective of them. Let them ENJOY.  Remember, WORDS MATTER.  Have a DELIGHTFUL day.

If it bothers you, I suggest ignoring it as opposed to sending out a selfish &amp; negative tweet.  Carry on, LOYAL #WOKENWarriors!

@KennyOmegamanX @Vanguard1AAR Win your #GreatWar, One who Cleans.. That’s positively worthy of ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
In my #WOKEN AWARENESS, I see Beings everyday that are in utter DENIAL.  They REPUDIATE the fact that I’ve made their VESSEL both EMPTY &amp; OBSOLETE.  Once your ESSENCE has been DELETED, CHANGE is INEXORABLE..  Either you EMBRACE the DELETION, or it BREAKS you.  Ask Nero, Bray. https://t.co/gbgoruSiKY
