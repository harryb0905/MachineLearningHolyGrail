Sad news out of KC.  Sending thoughts out to everyone back home, especially those effected by today's gas explosion.
Quote of the day:  "Sometimes, 6/8 feels like work."
Couldn't have said it better myself... http://t.co/jjRNcBf8
2nite's @Sevendust show was insane!  @morgan7d might be 1 of the best drummers I've ever seen, and @ljspoon still 1 of my fave frontmen.

Enjoying the @pacers vs Heat game tonight with some family!  Thanks to the @pacers for helping take care of us!
Listening to the songs I wrote with @andyskib and @andywaldeck the past couple days.  Holy hell.  Loving these tracks.
Writing right now with @andyskib and @andywaldeck.  It's getting pretty Andy up in here.  To the Andy-th degree.  Hello to the Jennies.
U know a song is big when singing the high harmony on the chorus gives you a headache. Feel like I got kicked in the face by a brain freeze.
The 2013 Race For Hope DC will be here before you know it. Team DC, LET'S DO THIS! http://t.co/qQ1mj1gb @curebraintumors
Writing something called a "song" with @andyskib and @neilbang.  Wild stuff.
Writing today with @andyskib.  BBQ break in progress.
UPDATE:  The banjo has been nixed from this song.  Emphatically.  (No banjo was harmed in the making of this tweet) http://t.co/FPnszXfP
Writing today with the illustrious Nathan Chapman. Just shy of noon, and the banjo is already out.  This is happening, folks.

Thanks, everyone, for the early birthday wishes!  Much appreciated!
Just now seeing the news out of CT.  Absolutely gut-wrenching.  My thoughts and sympathies go out to all those impacted.
Waiting to board and fly to Indonesia for a private gig.  Ben Folds was on my flight from Nashville to LA.  I'm calling that a good omen.
So, I just texted the word "brangelina" to @hodgesmusic, as part of a joke, and my phone did not autocorrect it, and now I'm sad for myself.
Song of the day: "Goodbye LA" by those @GRO boys.
@nickadamsdrums "(crying) I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE!!!!!" - you, five seconds after taking this photo. boom.
Happy Sunday, everyone!

@DwiiiVaa possibly.  working on it.
@MadeeCookWifey depends on the song.  Permanent was written quickly, but Paper Heart took a bit.

@doxxie1225 I did most of the lyrics, but @andyskib was involved as well.
@ThisLoudFandom music is way easier than the lyrics, for me, normally.

This @OurLadyPeace show is battling to become my favorite OLP show ever, and it's currently winning.

@JLedetAI11 duuuuuuuuuuuuuude.  Damn.  That was legit one of the best performances I've seen, idol or otherwise, in a long time.  Well done!
Golf, hiking, and BBQ today.  Is there a name for this sort of joyous trifecta?  Cause of there isn't, there should be.
Well, dinner just made it home, so I'm out!  Thanks, everyone for the questions!  Later!!
@debrakay23 @montyanderson yeah, and I'd tell you who won, but Mont would get super pissed.  :)
@ShookByCook you've already heard one.  "A Daily AntheM"
@alamodame sure, if it were the right part.
@FadingtoRed thanks.  :)  It's still around.
@lampshade_17 probably not.  Got all my dancing out during those fantastic Idol group numbers.  :)
@FallBackIntoMe never say never, but it'd have to work with the rest of the record.
@Lobsters1 "Born to Run".
@greeneyeskc If my legs are still up for it after the marathon and the RFH in DC...  probably.

T-Minus 2 hrs, 3 mins til MU/KU bball game. Should @MrAndrewCook sleep in the garage if MU wins? If the lose? Ah, I kid. Garage either way!

@laciee_xo Can't wait!   I always enjoy being involved in the RFH.
@CookIng_ The writing is going great!  Really enjoying what we've got in the can so far.
@kevonlie "Clipping" by Mutemath
@_Everything_Zen it's going alright.  An injury threw me off a bit, but I'll finish the marathon, one way or the other.
Home sick today.  Figure it's as good a time as any for a little Q&A.  Fire away, if you're so inclined.  I'll get to some of 'em.
Finished another song with @andyskib today.  Even got @MrAndrewCook in on the act, recording some backup vocals whilst rocking a mustache.
Really proud of the stuff we've gotten done so far.  Setting a new bar.

And now it's funky cold medina.  He's trying to sync the turn signal to the cowbell.
Road tripping back to LA with @MrAndrewCook. Not even thru Okla. yet, and he's steering wheel drumming. Contemplating walking from here.

Now I'm off to buy the whole team a beer, per team punishment guidelines for such an offense.

Sitting in a recording studio, recording radio liners.  I've had to say @RyanSeacrest's name roughly 277 times in the last hour alone.
Which would be worse/funnier: to get pulled over by a roller-skating cop or by a roller-blading cop?
@montyanderson boohoo?  :)
Love seeing friends kicking ass and happy. @CarlySmithson and co. were awesome in Viva Elvis! Everyone should go see it if given the chance.

@MrAndrewCook man, predictive text makes trash talk tough.  Couldn't = could've.
@MrAndrewCook and your one loss was the single worst loss you couldn't had.  I mean, the guys only win was against YOU.  Ouchtown.

He was wearing the coat.  Not me.  I can see how that may have been confusing.
Today is weird.  Saw a man riding a motorcycle in the rain, all while wearing a trench-style fur coat.  I was, and still am, confused.
Just saw a city bus with two ads on the back.  One was a lap band surgery ad, the other was for Jack In The Box.  I may have laughed.
@ericstonestreet M-I-Z-Z-O-U.  That is all.

@shirleyhalperin to be fair, I waited until you hit 1,999 followers.  Like waiting 'til the last second to bid on something on Ebay.

Not trying to open some political forum.  I was really wondering what she meant, and thought may someone out there had more insight.
Did Palin call American Idol contestants "talent-deprived"?  I just read the blurb, so i'm not sure if i'm taking that out of context.

afternoon workout time.  @nealfingtiemann is joining @andyskib and myself.  Hilarity may or may not ensue.  I bet it does.
Tennis with @andyskib and @getbeyondfit, then some lunch, then more working out, then rest up for some studio goodness.  Monday Funday.
Ok, NFL, you've imposed your will on "devastating hits".  Now do something about that call in the PIT/MIA game.  Yikes.  Oh... And #GoChiefs

Notice how @montyanderson is at the airport. Couldn't face the loss in front of me, so he's skipping town.  #GoMIZZOU
Doin' a little workie work in the studio.  Then grocery shopping for the sports weekend ahead.  MU v. OU, UFC 121, and Chiefs v. Jags!

To clarify.  I could, but I won't.
I could do it.  #jackass3D
About to watch jackass3D with a couple of jackasses.  @MrAndrewCook And @montyanderson.
Just so you know: @Montyanderson is a dirty ultimate frisbee player.  He throws elbows.  #themoreuknowBAHBAHBAHBAAAH
That last texans TD was facilitated by a terrible Pass Interference call.  If houston wins, give the game ball to the ref.  He earned it.
Way to respond, Bowe!  #GoCHIEFS
@switchfoot there's a place in lees summit, mo called hickory pit.  And it's hard to go wrong with Arthur bryants or gates.
At a photoshoot and look who decided to show up!  Missed ya, buddy. http://yfrog.com/4xr8mj
Oh and happy 2nd birthday to the beast!  There might be a boneless pork chop in your future.
‚Äú@MrRaineMaida: a sqr piece of paper cannot be folded in half more than 7 times‚Äù is that a challenge?... I'm in.
@Machado_ one step ahead of you, but thank you!  Check out Thornley's "tiny pictures"!
I wish I'd written "All By Design" by Big Wreck.  Hell, I wish I'd written their entire catalog.  It's been my soundtrack today.
Glad to see all the Chilean miners made it out safely.  Good, good news.
I think someone from @emblemmusic thought I was @RachReinert from @glorianatheband for a second.  Sorry, @RachReinert.
Finished a new song with @nealfingtiemann and @hodgesmusic.   Even worked up some choreography.  Hodges dances like a liquid tiger?
Congrats, Indy.  Great game.  Damn, those Bowe drops killed us.
I hope everyone's laughing, cause that pass interference call was a joke.
Hmmmm Sunday morning... I feel like there's something going on...  Think, David, think! http://yfrog.com/jdaacoj
@danielisrad let me know when and where
To the folks over at @Hollerado:  GREAT video and awesome song!
This is awesome!  Anyone know who this band is?  http://www.todaysbigthing.com/2010/10/06
Doing a little writing with @nealfingtiemann.   Really cool up tempo idea.
Just finished an afternoon workout with @getbeyondfit and @montyanderson.  Nobody puked.  Success!
Im doing laundry on this Wed.  Somehow, I doubt that was how Thomas Jefferson imagined it when he coined the phrase "hump day". #fakehistory
Just heard myself sing "magic rainbow" in Bed, Bath & Beyond.  It'd be the Time Of My Life if I could find the towels.
rain, rain, go away.  that is all.
That archie kid, @DavidArchie, has a new album out today.  Go check it out on iTunes!!!
Back in The Angeles.  Gonna hang with the bro and the pooch and eat the dinner.  Have a great night, all.
There's a parade going on outside our brunch.  I feel like I have to chew in rhythm to the marching band going by.
Alright.  Night over.  I got to two of you on that whole "drink a glass of wine for everyone" idea.  So close.
Thanks to all 150,000+ of you!  I will attempt to drink one glass of wine for each of you tonight.  #sundayisgonnahurt
Just remember, @leedewyze... It's a beautiful day.
FYI- if @LeeDewyze sings "Hello" by Lionel Richie one more time today, I may be forced to slug him in the arm.
@SirDukeLuke well when the next elections come up, I wouldn't plan on running unopposed.  Ha!
I imagine it would be awesome to be the Mayor of Funkytown.
I dedicate my 1500th tweet to this guy.  Pee on, young man.  Pee on. http://yfrog.com/jnckmsj
@LeeDeWyze you speak truths, good sir.  I think.  Tomorrow tonight?
Holy hell!  There's a double rainbow in LA!
Bummed to hear about Greg Giraldo.  One of my favorite comedians.  Met during my first trip to LA in '04.  Such a nice guy.

Just saw Easy A.  I give it an Easy A.  Get it?!? Damn, that was one funny joke I just told.
At 9:45pm in LA, it's 93 degrees outside.  I blame Mr. Sixx's dog farts.
Triple digits in LA today, and the AC is out in the house.  It's damn near comedic.
Sorry, 31-10.
Great game, Chiefs!!!  31-3!
I have the hiccups.  Sonofabitch!!!!
Sorry, Zeus.  I punched you.
Friday Night Adventures!

Drunk guys walking with a determined look and a purposeful step are, in a word, hilarious.
YEAH!!!!
Loving this game!  Being here live was worth the travel.
Ok, made it home!  Gonna go get rained on and watch a KC win!
Damn rain comes 5 minutes after we board, and now, out on the runway, they shut down all departures... Well, I tried, Chiefs.  Give 'em hell
Now I'm off to go root for a certain red and yellow clad team!  Best of luck to Nadal and Djokovic!  Two class acts!  Wish I could've stayed
Thanks, @USOpen for an amazing experience!  Such a great time!
Oh and since I won't make it to be there in person... GO @Royals!!!!

Bummer about today being rained out. Waiting on details for tomorrow.  Thx to everyone who was tuning in.
Rain, rain, go away...
8:15am soundcheck.  Good morning, undersleptedness, my old friend.  Gonna find some ass-kicking' coffee drink.
Got to see a Mets win, as well as David Wright and Mike Sweeney!  Great game!  Now off to find dinner and some rehearsal for tomorrow
The vibe in NYC today is palpable.  May we never forget the events or the people lost on this day nine years ago.
Hey @nealfingtiemann:  Danny Trejo?
In the studio, watching a childrens' choir cut some vocals on some stuff for the record.  So rad.
Late night mixing session!  Yes sir!...  Or ma'am...  Or miss...  Man, that got complicated...
Alright.  Productiveness is the name of the game today.  Gotta get ready for this weekend!
@andyskib do many like it after noon?
Hey all. Good morning/afternoon/whatevertimeitiswhereyouare.  @GRO has a new EP on iTunes!  GO check out "The Morning Passengers" EP!
hope everyone is having a fantastical Sunday.  working on a cool song idea with @MrRaineMaida
I may have just fallen in love with ultimate frisbee.  Shhhh... Don't tell chocolate ice cream...
@danielisrad I actually liked it.
Having lunch/bfast with @MrAndrewCook and @MontyAnderson.  Andrew's singing the new Cee-Lo single a bit too loud.
Nothing beats listening to a finished demo of a new song.
Why were the musketeers named as such when they didn't use muskets?  #bobadang

Oh @GRO.  You guys really need to keep better tabs on ol' Lazer.  We've now seen what happens when he's given complete freedom.
‚Äú@ZerstorteZelle: Hollywood dog park. Abundant ass sniffing.‚Äù. And that wasn't even the dogs... Bah-dum-CHA!!!
I'm back in the saddle again... And by saddle, I mean the studio.  And by back, I mean recording.  And by again, I mean...well... Again.
Not sure why this is hilarious, but... it is.  http://t.co/0yotprr
Just destroyed some @TheGriddleCafe, now going to watch @MrAndrewCook play softball, then writing, then grilling out.  SATURDAY!!!
Driving home, listening to @OurLadyPeace's "Live" Album...  Yeah, buddy.
Gonna hang with the bro for a bit, then do some writing with the boys.  Have a great night, all!
Food.  DAMN!!!... It's a process, folks.  Bear with me...
I've noticed I'm tweeting spot about food lately, so I'm gonna stop doing that.
On days like today, in times like these, when the planets align just so, and the world sits in harmony... A cheeseburger'd be sweet.
"critics rave, "It's a movie!'"
@RyanStar keep an eye out for law enforcement.  They usually frown on such behavior.
Massively proud of my boy, @RyanStar!  Great show!!!
Late start to this fine Tuesday.  Gonna start it off with some breakfast and the Hasselhoff Roast.  The folks would be proud.

On the eve of his record release, a HUGE congrats to my friend, @RyanStar!  Everyone go pick up his record, "11:59", starting tomorrow!!!
If there were a way to combine "Inception" and "Shark Week", I might be inclined to buy a ticket to said event.
Great start to the day.  Ran with @montyanderson and beat @MrAndrewCook in Madden on a last second FG.  Up next... Rehearsal for BG!
Cool, thanks guys.  For those I didn't get to, as always, sorry...  have a great Saturday

OK, enough fantasy talk... gonna focus on the record now!  but hey... a boy can dream...  lol
OK, this has become a production.  We may not get it to you today, but this could be good... stay tuned...
we may have to track either the theme song or Rustys Power Ballad in studio, for fun...

At dinner earlier, and this rad 5-year old kid named Trevor came up and started belting Styx "Come Sail Away" for us.  So awesome!
Happy dad's day to all dads, including my dad, and your dad.... Dad.
great day today.  caught up on Dexter.  Pre-production went well.  DInner with bro and grandma.  Now onto that damn laundry...
@CHRIS_Daughtry - Dude.  I was shocked.
That's it.  Every person associated with this show gets an Emmy for Badass-ery.  SO GOOD!
Two episodes of Dexter season 4 left to go.  It's like crack that you can legally buy on iTunes.
Great day of pre-production.  Now sushi.  Then... Either laundry or debauchery.
well, it was exciting to watch.  congrats to both teams on a great series and season.  get 'em next year, Green!
well... (expletive laden rant)
RT @alexWTrugs dude, thats the best season by far. john lithgow is awesome. // We have a bigfoot statue at the house we named John Lithgow.

Happy Birthday to the Kenny Loggins Doppelganger that lives in my house: @MrAndrewCook
‚Äú@nealfingtiemann: RT @jensuenye @andyskib I still want Sonic... Make it happen!‚Äù // ME TOO!!!

Random thought:  what ever happened to the juggarnaut that was Binaca?
Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong day.  Now I'm off to go pick up @MrAndrewCook from the fly fly.

It's not a celtics thing.  The bad calls are plentiful for both sides.  Just bad officiating this whole series, all around.
Another AWFUL call.  Way to go refs! &lt;---- (sarcasm)
Dear makers of Kit Kats and/or Twinkies:  can you make a healthy version of your delicious treat?  'preciate it.

Band discussion over lunch:  why is booze called spirits?  Discuss.
Loving the internal debate I'm having. Does better artistic output come from intent or the lack thereof? Maybe watching "Mr. Bean" will help
@alexWTrugs just randomly met your mom at Starbucks.  Sweet lady, and an avid Celtics fan to boot!
@montyanderson quote of the day: "Curiousity makes me wonder."
Eating breakfast, and watching @SaraBareilles live at the Fillmore on Palladium.  Great start to the day.
back to work cleaning house!
I will say, though, I agree with Jeff Van Gundy.  the Lakers played all the way to the end.  Lovin' this series so far.
c'mon Celtics, finish strong!!!
@hodgesmusic and without the awful fouls the refs are calling in your favor, this is starting to smell alot like '08
@hodgesmusic just remember that pseudo-smack your talking when you have to don that gorgeous green jersey!
Sunday checklist:  finishing unpacking and clean house, go for a run, and watch my celts tie up the series.  Happy Sunday, everyone.

Jim Joyce is a class act. I hope MLB fixes this and corrects the blown call, but to see the way the ump has handled it, my hat's off to him.
So... I need to find Boston Celtics apparel in Los Angeles before tomorrow's game.  Anyone in LA know of any places?
Bummer to hear Griffey Jr. is retiring.  Great player and great guy.  I'll admit to copying his swing when I played.  Didn't work out for me

@Savan_Kotecha however, tweeting the person sitting directly to your left is at all times unnecessary and does nothing for my street cred

I just traded my kiss tour tshirt for an alf tshirt.  Epic.  Thanks, Josh!
I did not take last.  I did not take first.  Also, I did not shoot well.  But I DID have a good time.
Gonna start my day the way every day should be started... golf.  yes, I say to you.  yes.
I'm pretty sure I love my dog and the current LA weather, among other things...
True Gentlemen worthy of your following: @samiamhollander, @ClaudeKelly, @RyanStar, and @EWMichaelSlezak.  FACE!
Check out the new vlog over at www.davidcookofficial.com!
new profile pic of me being dumb.   enjoy!
Just ran 3 miles in manhattan beach this morning, now off to go write.  I hope Monday enjoys the kick in the ass I'm giving it...
Watching The Wolfman.  A perfect valentine's day movie...
Happy VD, folks!  :)
I'm fine,  no injuries.  very minor.  Just yellow paint and a fresh dent on my car.  Damn jerk.
What I want to say to the cabbie who didn't use a turn signal, hit my new car, and drove off... isn't fit for twitter.  hint = F--- Y--.
I think if a choir teacher was also a home realtor, their slogan could be "Do Re Me Fa Sol La Ti SOLD!"  ...OK, now, back to work for me...
Diet+Good Workout+Songwriting=My Day Today. See that, Blue Springs South HS Math Teachers?!? Maybe now U could change that old trig grade
woke up late, missed breakfast, workout sucked as a result.  Consider that my lesson learned for the day.
love that you guys are enjoying the EW interview.  Thank you for the great hang, @EWMichaelSlezak.
So far... The Stevie wonder/volkswagen commercial is the funniest one yet!
Congrats, Brian Waters on winning the Walter Peyton Man of the Year Award!
Colts?  Saints?  I'm rooting for sideline reporter Soloman Wilcots.
Just finished the end of season two of Sons Of Anarchy.  Either the worst or best season ending cliffhanger ever... C'mon season 3!
RT @finnty @thedavidcook We need proof that it's working // I'm working on that for you... lol
Hey folks. If you want to train with the same guy I do, you can online! go to www.exercisetv.tv and click Marco Reed under videos. Have fun!
@samiamhollander nay, sir.  where do I find this gem?
Listening to "The Best Of The Talking Heads".  absolutely... genius.
Kudos, @kelly_clarkson.  Love it.
Thanks, @MyTrainerBob!  Hopefully, you didn't see me gasping for air...  :)
@CarlySmithson tell him I said hey
Worked out and such today, now grabbing lunch with @nealfingtiemann and @ACookOfficial.  Chili, you say?  Yes indeed...
so.... as some of you already figured out... the VLOG is up!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJPB8WX9IFI
FYI Vlog will be up today!  Sorry for the delay, folks.
lol, to be clear... we're listening to demos.  We haven't hit the studio yet.
In a meeting, listening over all the songs written so far.  Great to hear them all in succession. Can't wait to get this record to u guys.
just got the new @Wearethefallen single, "Bury Me Alive", on iTunes.  Everyone should go check it out and support @CarlySmithson!
Saw @RyanSeacrest at the gym.  Then the trainer kicked my @$$!  Awesome start to the day!
laying low this weekend with @ACookOfficial, @nealfingtiemann, and the Dubs.  Lovin' it, but already restless. Vlog will be up in a few days
Back in LA...  Wow... Deja vu.  I feel like I've tweeted that before....  Weird.
The day has begun!  Goodbye, New York, you kooky ol' broad, you...
Finishing up here in NYC.  Happy with the work done here, plus I heart NY.  Working on some vlogness for you guys in the next few days.
@orlyyowl they were not leather.  believe it.
RT @bo08mo: @andyskib But you have prettier hair than @thedavidcook.// agreed.  sad but true.
I love @andyskib's voice, primarily because it's nothing like mine.  we mesh well vocally.  whew... glad that's settled.  lol
RT @rockmejoseph @thedavidcook smells like a hit // I read that wrong the first time, and got slightly offended...  :)
@mitch_friedman will do, man.  awesome song!
Hell, I may cover this for our next single...  LOOK OUT, BILLBOARD'S NUMBER ONE SPOT!!!
So, on occasion, I'm asked how I go about writing.  This video explains it adequately.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abo6oEXB4no
you'll also notice I went back to my audition hairstyle.... kidding... OK, I'm done.  Sorry again.  it was too funny to pass up.
You've been asking for a record sneak peek, well here you go.  Apologies in advance.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A43JOxLa5MM
sorry, guys.  All this is happening during a writing session.  Had to refocus.  I'll save my venom for watching the game, I suppose.
@Jeriney bring it on, miss.
RT @pokertrace @thedavidcook but there are no Zs in missouri / There are no jayhawks in KU, or anywhere for that matter.  They're fake birds
RT @AmandaLynnMSU @thedavidcook I'm with you David. I hope KU wins by 20!// ummmm... if you want KU to win, then we disagree... M-I-Z-Z-O-U!
RT @skoenig45 @thedavidcook MU v KU Boarder War tonight!! Rock Chalk!! // ...dangerously close to getting blocked.  :)
FYI, Sluggerrr is the mascot.  He's also a lion. Neither of these qualities would allow him to be an actual major league batter.
So, my @KCRoyals are looking to hire a new Sluggerrr... is it too late to throw my name in the hat?  LOL
@hodgesmusic...  bravo, sir.  Lovin' it.
RT @ClaudeKelly aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand boom goes the dynamite! //  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
@montyanderson every time i think of El Bow-ho, I can only shake my head and laugh...
LAST, not PAST.  Thick thumbs are not a plus when text tweeting...
Conan's speech at the end of his past show tonight got me a little choked up.  Can't wait to see what he does next.
Back in the apple!  Gotta catch up with @ryanstar and his gang of hooligans and Dallin
whew.  another long day.  packing to get on that crazy ol' metal bird tomorrow.  More writing next week.
just checking in.  Busy day today.  finishing up some song ideas and being domesticatious.  And yes, that is a real word I just made up...
Dinner with @ACookOfficial and @lukemenard.  What should I order...  Hmmmm...
song in a day, you say?  yep.  That happened.
@michael_johns Damn! I'm in LA until the 22!  I still haven't seen you live, which is not acceptable.  Not at all.
What a great way to start the day! 90,000!  thank you guys!  Off to go write...
At best buy.  Some girl asked if i was David Archuleta.  Thought about saying yes... But didn't
writing with Mr @hodgesmusic again.  can the first song be topped?  CHALLENGE!!!
@ RTbleedingxsoul i want to stick a spoon in @thedavidcook. // ummmmm.... what?  lol
So happy to see Michael C. Hall win for "Dexter".  To see his castmates emote for them the way they did made me even happier.
Dr. Squealzgood!!!!
Full day hangin with Mom while @ACookOfficial footballed it up.  Awesome day from start to finish.
RT @shesha1916 sometimes I want to kick the shit out of @thedavidcook // me too.  :)
RT @GeckoBalboa Awesome! Just down the road from the giant dinosaurs from Peewee's Big Adventure // well, I now know where I'll be going...
Sorry guys, for the delay...  The internet can be cruel at times...
New show!  February 27th, Morongo Casino, Palm Springs, CA area!  See you all there!
OK, remember yesterday when I said I had some potential news?  REMEMBER?!?  well it's confirmed...
Back at it today.  No internet at home right now, so kind of out of the loop.   However u choose 2 give today, do it.  #HelpHaiti

Writing today and tomorrow with @raine_maida and @chantalkrev.  I am moderately to severely stoked, in case you were wondering.
Happy Thursday!  Some potential news of note... When and if all gets confirmed, i'll fill you in.  In the meantime...
Caught the west coast feed of AI tonight.  Pants.  On.  The.  Ground.  Priceless.
Lovin' this new song idea....  just sayin...
New AI season tonight.  If you look at it like a family tree, does that mean I'm about to be grandpa?!?  I'M ONLY 27!!!
RT @Laurie_0 @thedavidcook I guess we did it for you - @hodgesmusic aren't we nice. // you sure are.  thanks, all.
Back at it today!  writing with Mr. David Hodges.  I'll find out his twitter name later...

RT @misskdcox @thedavidcook dude you are outrageously random with the tweets today / FACT.
speaking of Doogie Howser... Did anyone else notice how he always seemed to type kind of slow?  Just an observation.
RT @honestys_easy false. Most inspirational Stallone movie is Over The Top. He's competitive arm wrestling...for his SON. / touche...
oh... and I want to see 'Youth In Revolt".  We now return you to your regularly scheduled program... "Doogie Howser, M.D." I'm weird today.
Damn you, Sly Stallone.  Rocky IV is far too inspirational.
Finished up some phone interviews and a quick workout.  Gonna finish up song #2 with Mr. Howes 2day and 2morrow.  Cue celebratory fist pump.
For the record, i'm actually out here writing with Brian Howes.  He co-wrote "Light On" with Cornell.
Finished lead vox on a new song just now.  Pretty stoked about it.  We'll see...
"I'm baaaack!  I'm baaaack in the saddle again!" - Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.  This also applies to me being at another writing session.
I hear you @john_socal. I'm also writing with the guys some.  Just exploring many avenues.  Great songs are everywhere.
taking a writing break, so I thought I'd tell you I'm writing...
RT @KaylynnMichelle Don't you mean,Is Raine Madia ready for me? I know your secret /Glad you do, cause I have no idea what you're sayin.  :)
After 1.5 hours in customs, followed by a mad dash for guitars/luggage... I am ready for Vancouver!  The question is...is it ready for me?
sorry, Vancouver... lol  AMENDMENT: rain coat/definitely NOT winter coat?  packed.
In honor of @GRO... "Gooooooobye, L.A."  I'm off to Vancouver to do some more writing.  winter coat? packed.
Damn, I forgot the @.   Congrats @KC_Chiefs1... Undefeated in 2010!!!
Congrats, KC_Chiefs1... Undefeated in 2010!!'. :)
Golf day with @andyskib, @Clementville, and mantracker of @fire_tornado.  This golf course may cry when we're through with it...
To @thegriddlecafe:  the red velvet pancake situation... Nice!
Breakfast with fam before they head home.  Then it's write, write, write!
Day one of '10: workout done.  Write for a bit and hang with fam up next.  Thanks again to all for last night's show.  Incredible!
FYI... @montyanderson's new nickname is "STANK".  Pass it on.
Happy new year!!!  I'm celebrating 2010's inception.
