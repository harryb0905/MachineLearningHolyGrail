@cindyta93 They are incredible, right?
Wow, @TaylorGutiars really did a great job with these videos. Here's "1,2,3,4" http://t.co/5tHdRNu via @youtube
Check out this video of us playing Rhythm of Love live in the Taylor Guitars room at NAMM. http://t.co/bYy0RAn via @youtube
@NicShizzle wow, that's crazy. Maybe you can give me a haircut next time we're out there.
The fact that "work" trumps "sleep" has always bugged me a little.
Ask me anything, BUT MAKE IT GOOD.  Seriously, make it good. http://formspring.me/retondo
@melissapickett Some air cannot be freshened.
I think we should rename the bunk area of our bus "land of a million farts". Waking up and getting out of there today was a simple task.
@NicShizzle Do I even want to know?
@spywall like the deserts miss the rain, old man.
Plain White T's streaming live from BLIP.fm in a few minutes!
Tim has been sick, and I think the only thing that will cure his illness is if someone brings him a copy of Tiger Woods 2011 for PS3.
Ask me anything, but make it good.  http://formspring.me/retondo
I can't get SimTower to run on Windows Vista 64 and it's bumming me out.
Ordered UFC pay per view on the bus. So awesome. Insane.
VAPE HARD!
@TomBropez I look like a gremlin.
@spywall End of an era.
Watching old slam dunk contests. SPUD WEBB!!!!
@nikkyni Hopefully we'll get to come to Italy at some point. That would be amazing!
An Idiot Abroad is a genius show
THANKS! Who would to that? RT "Someone took @retondo name off the @PlainWhiteTs page on Wikipedia, I put it back, yeah :D"
So when we were in Canada, @demarhamilton wanted to try my beer. He took a sip and immediately coughed/sneezed/choked/snotted into my beer.
Back in Chicago and it feels like summer! Compared to Manitoba at least...
LG Show in Brandon, MB was incredible despite the cold. Except Delilah sucked :-) Back home tomorrow to watch the Bears do their thing.
Flying to Winnipeg where it's -9F. Yikes.
@tristanemma Was that more of that 'sarcasm' stuff? Whales are huge, dude...
Set my alarm for 8:00. Hit the snooze every five minutes until 10:30. How many micro-naps is that? I am the king of the snooze!!
@simonpegg My mom's not Canadian, but when I was a kid I'd tell her I was going to a show (concert), and she'd say "oh, what movie?". Crazy.
First day of rehearsal for the Wonders of the Younger tour. I was a little late, but Tom was reeeallly late. He forgot his ears.
@tristanemma That Chipotle is the greatest thing ever. You should check out wahaca for some awesome (especially in the UK) Mexican food.
Anyone else ever notice that the internet is pretty much dead on Sundays?
The Bears kicked ass today and it was awesome.
Off to bed, then Chicago Bears halftime show tomorrow.
@DanSherwood I guess that's acceptable. I do tell people I'm from "Chicago" after all...
@DanSherwood I think he lives in Redmond, actually. :-P Holy crap is he amazing at Donkey Kong though...
@MauricioCBB For real, it was awesome! That is crazy.
@maryannerooney It was very crowded earlier, but then it cleared out after the first attempt. I had to go home.
At Logan Hardware to watch Steve Wiebe get the new Donkey Kong world record. #teamwiebe
Hanging out at Soldier Field. Like a boss.
@gabipss Tim's twitter is @tombropez. It's confusing, I know.
@gabipss Thanks for all the support!
@aileenburns That's ridiculous!
No one wants to watch Steve Wiebe go for the Donkey Kong high score at logan hardware with me tomorrow...
Bagels are the shitty bastard cousin of donuts. Donuts are far superior, just don't put any lox on them.
Cheeseburger streak continues.
@tristanemma Sarcasm? What's that??
@tristanemma If you were born under the sign of Leo, you will always have been born under the sign of Leo. How could that possibly change?
@demarhamilton So glad you found that funny, boss.
@sartotherah Killing people's religions is what I do! Err... I mean... Sorry? Congrats on the kitty though...
Dire Straits' Money for Nothing was just deemed too offensive for Canadian radio. They also just deemed the Ford Pinto unsafe at any speed.
Breaking news!! All mythological creatures are to be referred to as "unicorns" now except for unicorns, which are now "McHorses¬Æ".
@aileenburns Absolutely not. I need meat and cheese in some kind of carbohydrate wrapper to survive.
Done with Horoscope talk. Next topic: difference between sphinxes, manticores, harpies, griffins,& wyverns. Maybe cockatrice if your lucky.
Tropical astrology (the one you know) doesn't change. Sidereal astrology (only popular in eastern culture) does and has always had Ophiuchus
http://youtu.be/oQPFoDkGFrU Bill Nye talks about Zodiac sign shift. From 2005. They've been off for 2000 years, and bullshit for far longer.
@aileenburns When tour starts, me and you are eating nothing but tofu and celery.
Me and @tombropez have eaten a burrito, a cheeseburger, or both every single day we've been in Los Angeles.
Astrology is 100% bullshit. Also, if you believe your zodiac sign is changing, you're dumber than a mustard covered cantaloupe.
My taste buds are into the burrito idea... My colon is not.
Nothing like an asada burrito to start the day off right.

Just rocked out for @georgelopez on Lopez Tonight. Watch it at 11pm on TBS. Tim showed his "Lopez" tattoo. LOL.

Making a video is hard work.
Video shoot today. Woke up at 5:30, checked phone, found out I didn't need to get up until 7:00. Sonofabitch!
@demarhamilton Q:Is it possible to hold an iPad in first class without looking like an asshole? A:No.
General rule of thumb for videos is "hot video girl has priority over bearded bass player".
The video is gonna be so cool, I'm worried I might not be cool enough for it. Then again, I'm fucking radical sometimes.
plain White T's are making a new video. I'd give it about a 38% chance that I'll actually be in this one.
"Cheah! And monkeys might fly out of my butt" is my goto response to Kirk Cameron's dumb ass. @dancastady
@wannabepudim I would love to go to Brazil.
Slapstick AND MU330? Fuck, I hope I'm not on tour for that... If I hear Skankin' Pickle is playing, I'm canceling tours, damn it.
@aileenburns You probably just had some food stuck on there. :-)
@briankeithdiaz Jesus Christ, some people... That really pisses me off.

@grumpygamer Angry Sharks? Or would Friendly Sharks be more fitting?
@spywall You're coming to chicago today?
@tplunk They should get Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley instead. Actually, those movies didn't really paint Detroit in the best light...
@aileenburns Either get a cat, or lay out some mouse traps.
@tristanemma Figured it out, thanks. :-P
@dancastady Who, me? Or Benny Hill? I just enjoy the man's work. :-)
@RAQU3L Oh wow, that wasn't very obvious, but it works. Thanks!
Wowza! There's this new TV station in Chicago, and they're playing The Benny Hill Show. I like it! Slapstick, upskirts, and Yakety Sax. :-D
Is there a way to reply to a tweet and have the other person know which damn tweet of theirs you were actually referring to?
How come every time I start to clean my basement, it ends up being a complete disaster?
@tristanemma There's not much left, and I look really weird clean shaven.
Trimmed a few inches off my beard. Feels pretty strange. Might try pasting some cotton balls on there as a temporary fix.
Why is it so hard to convince gullible people of the fact that they're gullible? It doesn't make sense!
Got a pair of Wolverine boots. Every time I wear them, I feel like this: http://www.vimeo.com/451069
Beavis and Butthead will be making fun of the T's video 1,2,3,4 on the return of the show. Hell yeah!!

Listening to the new Kings of Leon album. Trying not to fall asleep.
Shit... I think Tom sings "werewolfs" on our new album. You win this round, Toronto.
Hey Toronto, why is it the maple "leafs" and not "leaves"? I'm "dieing" to know.
@MikeMKH It's even funnier to hear your own band on the radio in a bathroom...
Just passed the Ghostbusters firehouse in NYC
@DanSherwood I believe the company Muzak is to blame. Google it.

How is "get fucked" an insult? Sounds like good advice to me.     #wordsofwisdom
@tristanemma Actually it was the frozen custard "concrete" afterwards that did it.
@tombropez that burger place was a bad idea.
Just had the most unhealthy dinner ever. Feels like I ate an entire birthday cake
Made a burger, ate it, then realized I forgot to put cheese on it. Had to make a second burger.

Guy in other car: just because no one calls you out like in 2nd grade doesn't meant we don't notice. Stop picking your nose.
Heading to the Cubs / Dodgers game with the rest of @ptws. No, Tom will not be wearing his Nelwyn jacket.
Getting styled 4 the @pwts video/photos, Tom scored a jacket that looks just like Willow Ufgood's tunic. I should go for Madmartigan's look.
