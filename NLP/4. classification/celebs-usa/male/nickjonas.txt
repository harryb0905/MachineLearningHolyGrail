#FindYouRemix is here 🔥 @offRami https://t.co/b9dNPkolQm https://t.co/QDToNsAD0H
After all that... 140 not 160. SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️ SAME POINT!
It's time to make this world a better place. I know we can do it. I love you all. #letlovewin
Being given more words to speak... means being given more responsibility. I commend @twitter for doing their part to help us all say more, which will in turn allow us to make a bigger impact globally. #letlovewin
I love my fans/followers and friends who are also committed to doing their part to make the world a better place. You are truly amazing, and every single one of you can be apart of a move towards a beautiful world. #letlovewin
To every single person effected by any and every act of violence or hate or natural disaster. Please know that I am with you. Beyond my thoughts and prayers I am making a commitment that my social media platforms will be used as a tool to find governmental and social resolutions.
There are so many ways we can all get involved to do our part to make the world a better place, and I'm hopeful that in the coming months and years these social media platforms that give all of us a voice to make the world a better place will enable us to do our part #letlovewin
I choose to be apart of the understanding and acknowledgement that there is a real problem, and that we can be the solution. #letlovewin
Next. Hate and or biased based on someone's race or background or religious beliefs or sexual orientation or identification... THIS MUST END. We are all one. #letlovewin
Okay. Real talk. Let's start with mass shootings. THIS HAS TO STOP. Too many innocent lives lost. My heart breaks every time I look at the news, and see that people that showed up to pray... or go to a concert or were just fucking walking down the street were killed. #letlovewin
Ah man I ran out of characters... 😑 I guess it'll just have to wait till I'm not limited anymore.
Hey everyone. I just wanted to say I'm not afraid to over share anymore. 160 characters used to define my point of view, but now being given over 200 characters is so liberating. I feel like I should start my first 260 character post by saying everything I wanted to say before..
Craigslist Missed Connections is a truly incredible place. Thanks for letting me dramatically read @wmag https://t.co/AdZGtew2w2 https://t.co/d7cCnnfXrr

Last Year Was Complicated
Fuck it. I'm gonna tell you the title.
.@ToveLo @BigSean @tydollasign @alleniverson thank you for being apart of this body of work.
Well maybe I've said too much tonight... Instagram tomorrow I reveal the album cover and title.
And the title of my new album coming out June 10th is..
Comfortable
Unhinged
Under You
Don't Make Me Choose
The Difference
Good Girls
Bacon
Touch
Chainsaw
Close
Champagne Problems
Voodoo
So I might as well tell you the title of each track right..
The track listing will be up tomorrow night too. With the pre sale of the album... Every song is so personal and meaningful to me..
The first song you're gonna hear tomorrow night is about how I literally can't open up and be vulnerable with someone..
But I know it's important that I do it. I want to be an open book in my art..
Shit is too real sometimes... Reliving some of these real life experiences through this music is hard.
It then became very clear what this thing would be about... And that I would need to dig really deep.
When I first started making I thought I knew what it would be about... Then I had a breakup.
Tomorrow night I'm gonna show the world the first single.
I've been making this record for a year and a half... Pouring everything I have into it.
A lot on my mind tonight...

For anyone living with diabetes.. Or any disease that complicates your life in any way.. Just know you are not alone.

On a different note... Saw my buddy @killiandonnelly kill it in @KinkyBootsUK last night. Truly a must see the whole cast is phenomenal.
I rarely sound off... But sometimes people just don't know how stupid they look and sound in an attempt to appear intelligent.
Vocal technique and overall ability. Credibility shouldn't be defined by a lack of acceptance for commercially successful material.
It's pretty ridiculous sometimes the negative bias shown towards pop artists by people who have no real credentials to be commenting on
