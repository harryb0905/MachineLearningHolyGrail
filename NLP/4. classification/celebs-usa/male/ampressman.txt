You can't touch Huawei's folding phone, either. But you can get right up close to the Mate X and take a decent picture (a helpful Huawei staffer even took pictures of the hinge from around back) #MWC19 https://t.co/mgtnm1GBTm
Meanwhile no one can touch the $2,000 folding Samsung phone, the Galaxy Fold. And it's in a roped off display case with multiple mirrors. Hard to judge size, thickness or much else about it. #MWC19 https://t.co/Jmlf04SxuL
5G phones really are thin and feel totally "normal" in the hand. The slightly larger than typical screens help hide larger batteries. But the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G for example just seems like a pretty normal phone. By itself not sure you could tell it's a 5G model #MWC19 https://t.co/r7I70j4koK
Not disclosing 5G mobile pricing at Sprint however.
Sprint president Michel Combs clarifies when he says they will be first to offer mobile 5G but not until May. AT&amp;T and Verizon could be sooner but Sprint’s network will be better, he asserts. Sprint will have the first broad mobile #5G coverage, he says. #MWC19 $S
Sprint will connect Google Fi customers to 5G network. #MWC19
@SprintCTO Sprint also partners with #5G streaming gaming company Hatch. Over 100 “premium” games on a phone without downloading them first. #MWC19
Sprint reveals square miles and potential number of users covered by its #5G service in first nine cities, coming in May. John Saw @SprintCTO says 1.1 million people will be covered in NYC, 750,000 in Dallas etc. #MWC19 $S

@caro_milanesi From What the iPad Pro Enables Matters More Than What It Replaces @caro_milanesi https://t.co/7PYooCqmB7
For many PC users the mouse is a core part of the experience which means that because the iPad Pro does not support a mouse, it cannot be a PC replacement...If Apple thinks the iPad is a true mobile computer, then it makes sense that it is looking at an alternative @caro_milanesi

Asked why Apple will stop disclosing unit sales, Apple CFO talks about a couple of totally unrelated things...
After Apple said it would stop reporting unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs anymore, its stock price after-hours dropped over 7,% putting its stock market value BELOW $1 trillion. OMG $AAPL
Our top competitors do not provide units of sales information either - Apple CFO.
We kept wondering when Apple would finally start breaking out watch sales. But instead they’re just going to stop reporting all unit sales of everything (iPhone, iPad, Macs). Yipes $AAPL
Well that’s just peachy https://t.co/WvRv6mbCcq
Apple will STOP reporting unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs next quarter. Boo
@sharatibken @Apple Bigly. Though last year, cheaper models on sale in this quarter (iPhone 8) and more expensive didn’t go on sale until the next quarter. This year it was the reverse (iPhone XS preceded XR).
Apple’s grand experiment in raising iPhone prices and adding more expensive models has completed Year One. The number of iPhones sold rose 0.4% to 217.7 million, while revenue rose 18% to $166.7 billion. #success $AAPL

The original MacBook still has a big weight advantage over the new MacBook Air, 2 lb to 2.7 lb.
So the not-updated, plain old MacBook is still priced at $1,300, which is $100 more than the brand spanking newly updated MacBook Air. How does that make any sense? And the only $1,000-ish option anymore is the outdated MacBook Air with non-retina screen. https://t.co/GGj231ajDs

The mystery is why. As @reckless identifies, this is the most troublesome part of the whole merger. Did Trump’s DOJ stay away from net neutrality because Trump’s FCC was tearing it down and that would have looked awkward? Was this really a political case all along?
Here there’s nothing, and it seems like the government never made this argument. All parties, including Judge Leon, seem to have assumed Internet service providers were just a bunch of highly regulated, dare I say, common carriers.
And in fact there’s a seven-year condition requiring Comcast to abide by net neutrality regardless of FCC or other federal policy

3/ So when you hear this "We anticipate smartwatch revenue to surpass tracker revenue in the second half of 2018," be careful what you wish fro $FIT
That should be: revenue was more than double in the previous quarter...duh
2/ The problem is that revenue *more than* doubled from the previous quarter, when it was $571 million. If smartwatches were say 15% of $571 million, that's $86 million. And 30% of $248 million is only $74 million.
1/ When a the "doubling" of a weird stat is actually showing a decline:  Fitbit revenue was $248 million "with smartwatches constituting approximately 30% of our revenue and nearly doubling as a percentage of revenue on a sequential basis."

Tim Cook as Lloyd Dobler: "China only wins if the US wins and the US only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the US win."
Tim Cook is not a football fan… “The iPhone X is a beloved product. I think that it's one of those things where a team wins the super bow,l maybe you want them to win by a few more points, but it's a super bowl winner.” $AAPL
So Tim Cook’s bet on higher prices continues to pay off. From when the bet was placed: Why Apple Just Hiked the Price of Every New iPhone https://t.co/uUuopNaM5J
Apple sold 3% more iPhones than the same quarter last year. But revenue jumped 14%. Yay price increases.  That’s about the same as last quarter when iPhone sales slipped 1% but revenue increased 13%. $AAPL

Oh about that T-Mobile Sprint mega merger? @haroldfeld is not a fan - Commentary: Where are the disruptors in the wireless industry? https://t.co/sbDoHM7vAT via @FortuneMagazine
Elaborating on one reason Wall Street is disappointed with Sunday's T-Mobile-Sprint announcement, the companies said they'd have pro forma 2018 service revenue of $53-$57 billion. @FactSet tells me the combined median estimate was $54.7 bln, so the low end would be a big miss.
@DiaMariesbeat @KarlBode If he's recused, that would leave it more up to the career staff, so probably more likely to block?
@KarlBode #workedforqualcomm
Random thought but if the DOJ sued to block AT&amp;T from buying Time Warner when a vertical merger hadn't been challenged in decades (see US v. Hammermill Paper Co.), how do they not block T-Mobile-Sprint? The CNN/political motivation theory?
@saschasegan @FierceWireless 3/ Or, maybe there was baked in some excitement that TMUS/S would reduce competition but now the merger seems LESS likely...hard to say
@saschasegan @FierceWireless 2/ As to VZ and AT&amp;T, not sure. Could have nothing to do with the deal and be related to interest rates rising (high dividend stocks get hit). Evidence: S&amp;P High Dividend ETF down 1.5% last 2 days.
@saschasegan @FierceWireless 1/ Couple of things for S/TMUS. Some thought the exchange ratio would be even higher thus fear TM paying too much. The pro forma 2018 revenue number was light, so current business may be weak. No break up fee could signify the companies see a high chance of getting blocked.

The DOJ’s Horizontal Merger Guidelines say any industry with a post-merger HHI greater than 2,500 is considered to be “highly concentrated.” The Wireless industry has a pre-merger HHI of 2,700. The increase from a Sprint and T-Mobile would be another 500 points -Craig Moffett $S

Are there things you wish you would have done differently? I’m really proud of how well we did. I think over all the team and the company were dealt a very tough hand. We got great results for shareholders, we got great results for advertisers and our users and our employees.

@radleybalko I literally just made these two points to my wife at lunch...
Admittedly, and perhaps unfairly, I had high expectations for all three, so your views may differ.
3/ Taylor Swift's "Spotify Singles" diverge. An acapella version of "Delicate" is an improvement on the original. An acoustic cover of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's "September," not so much...
2/ Lost in Space, Netflix's 21st century remake of Irwin Allen's campy 1960s space exploration romp: C+ Mega budget special effects produced  a beautiful 10-episode run with the pacing of a sloth on valium.
Three mini-reviews in three tweets:  1/ Beirut, Tony Gilroy's ancient script finally made into a movie starring Jon Hamm: B-  Amazing scenery, sets and costumes along with great acting couldn't save this predictable tale, which sheds no light on modern mideast problems.

@TechNewsGen @FortuneMagazine Also not sure about comparing anything to anything. The point is just that Intel rolled out both new mobile and desktop chips the other day. FWIW they provided performance numbers at the same time.
