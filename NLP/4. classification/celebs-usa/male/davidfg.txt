@chillmage @CaseyNewton It's a strong week. https://t.co/xHDOWVpe8k
@cfarivar @NBCNews Come visit @kickstarter HQ.
@chillmage @CaseyNewton I may have just stumbled upon a whole new revenue stream...
@chillmage @CaseyNewton 'Weird Kickstarter' is thriving, but unfortunately for you, the best place to keep tabs on it is Kickstarter's Slack.
@jbenton What‚Äôs with the stray dot?
@mathowie @PJVogt Dude, spoilers.
@VincentDGabriel @EARTH3R Understood! cc @themadstone
@VincentDGabriel Hi: Nice piece -- but as far as I can tell Kickstarter was not a part of this story. Do you think you could get the headline fixed? Thanks.
@fimoculous @waxpancake The founders told @pkafka that they had emailed those investors to say they‚Äôd be getting a nice (unspecified) payout.
The second episode of @kickstarter's new podcast is a sonic wonderland. (And no, @spotify, it's not for sale.) https://t.co/MYTSy3myef
@cfarivar @arstechnica @NBCNews @oliviasolon Hey congrats!
@withfriends_co Bought some tix, got an email from your platform, I hit "No thanks, I'd like to remove myself" because I get too much email, this resulted in another email that said "Thanks for verifying your account!" So where do I actually remove myself? Thanks.
@lisatozzi Oh no. I listened to this former boss on a podcast and took weird pleasure in doubling the playback speed.

@waxpancake Very sorry, Andy. He sounds like a great guy.

@MRTIBBETS No changes that I know of. This started 1/1 at 5:33 AM so I wondered if it was a new-year glitch. Looks like my 15 latest checkins, all added 15 times on 1/1, twice today, then I turned it off. Just turned it on again. We'll see what happens! Thanks.

@AskCapitalOne OK. How do I get them as app notifications?
@mathowie That's actually me.
@AskCapitalOne There's also no option here to receive notifications about *all* transactions.
@AskCapitalOne I'd like to get them as app notifications, not as texts/emails. The Wallet app did this. How can I get those in the Capital One app?

@tangentialism Oh man you should totally build that.
@tangentialism Tricky when they own ~20% of @Spotify.
This'll improve as contracts get renewed, right? Then we can feel better about @spotify. https://t.co/rruR1GK2lJ https://t.co/oHBytlI052

@SFriedScientist That kind of generic reference in that context undermines a lot of the work we put in. I‚Äôll leave it at that.
@SFriedScientist Most readers will assume this is a KS project. Suggests platforms are all the same. I assure you they're not!
@SFriedScientist Not actually on Kickstarter. We require a demo of a working prototype.
@mollydneuman Yeah, I want to know more about the party buses.
@heartbarf I wish he'd write some poetry.

@mattydunn11 The Kickstarter project was to fund game dev tutorials, creator posted 36 of them, 26.5 hours worth: https://t.co/5NcfYwJRQL
@mattydunn11 Hi! Worth noting that Ant Sim wasn't a Kickstarter project.
@RT_TheKnow @AshleyJ @megturney Hi! Still an issue.
@GalbreathAndrew Worth noting that the campaign raised $4,459 to fund tutorials, creator published 26.5 hours worth: https://t.co/5NcfYwJRQL
@RT_TheKnow @ashleyj @megturney Eric raised $4,459 on Kickstarter to make game tutorials, published 36 of them. https://t.co/5NcfYwJRQL
@RT_TheKnow @ashleyj @megturney Hi! Issue: Ant Sim wasn't a Kickstarter project. Eric's KS reference is to an unrelated project.
@LiteralEric Hi Eric! Ant Sim wasn't a KS project. KS reference is to funds raised for unrelated tutorials project. https://t.co/vYOsncs0pO
@GalbreathAndrew Ant Sim was not "funded through a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014."
@GalbreathAndrew From what I understand: separate projects. KS project funded tutorials, which were about making "Inbotrination."
@cb00784 @Codiekitty There was no Ant Simulator Kickstarter.
@Futterish Thank you for fact-checking! Not much of that happening today...
@Romudeth @geekdotcom Hi Tony: Just to clarify, that game was not a Kickstarter project. Its creator ran a KS project for game tutorials.
@Kotaku_UK @jBenson Hi -- just to clarify, this was not a Kickstarted game. The KS project for game tutorials was a separate thing. Thanks!

@BenKuchera Thanks for the surprise followup!
@onidavin It's been covered, but it'll no doubt be covered again! https://t.co/oPK6998Cal (@katiechironis @benkuchera)
@onidavin No problem!
@katiechironis @BenKuchera It's obviously great that people care so much about the health of the system. We do too.
@BenKuchera 7% of those 27,360 new backers have already backed another project -- maybe even @katiechironis's very fine one?
@katiechironis @BenKuchera High-profile projects like these expose people to what is still a very new way of making games.
@katiechironis @benkuchera Useful stats: 22% of Bloodstained backers and 39% of Yooka backers have never backed a project before.

@DaveAtNORTH I'm genuinely torn. @spotify is obviously a music lover's dream. Payouts don't seem fair. I'd pay more if it'd go to artists.
@DaveAtNORTH Just hoping I can eventually enjoy @spotify without feeling the disapproving virtual stares of Byrne and @thomyorke.

@DaveAtNORTH Systems problem in what sense?
