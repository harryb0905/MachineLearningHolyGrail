Signs printed out at Tea Party rally: "Bury ObamaCare with Kennedy"  Will have pics up shortly.
Revising my estimate up to 40k having spoken to police, and in light of some large groups I found on Conn. Ave who had left main rally.
Crowd is overwhelmingly white and 35+
I'd put crowd at 10-20k. Only crowded area is b/w Capitol and 3rd. First part of mall is 1/4 full.
Heading to Tea Party rally on the Mall to take in the scene.
The media is bored and bloodthirsty. Why shdnt Coast Guard be training? B/c CNN might misreport what happened and scare everyone?
