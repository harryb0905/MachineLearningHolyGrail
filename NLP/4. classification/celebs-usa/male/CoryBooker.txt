Cool enough, debatable;   talented enough, doubtful. https://t.co/ybMQslSDDg
The #FightFor15 is about economic justice and ensuring every working American has a job that pays a living wage. Proud that New Jersey is helping lead this effort becoming the 4th state to raise our minimum wage to $15 an hour earlier this month. https://t.co/6LlUoHOLBD
Our health care system is clearly broken‚ÄîAmericans should not have to make the drastic choice between seeking medical care or considering whether that care will cost too much or result in personal bankruptcy. This is one of the many reasons why we should adopt Medicare for all.
I agree, Dan - the only way we‚Äôre going to stop this blatant voter suppression is by working together to fight it.  Friends, chip in now to help Dan in his special election and make sure all voters‚Äô voices are heard: https://t.co/zzhlRPg2rx https://t.co/kgAKV9h1o9

I‚Äôve always believed that words have power. This type of callous language is typical of the @NRA.  We need commonsense gun safety legislation. https://t.co/GaqHTaBmQ6
It‚Äôs not enough to just legalize marijuana at the federal level‚Äîwe should also expunge records of those who have served their time, and reinvest in communities hardest hit by the failed War on Drugs‚Äîwhich has really been a war on people.
We spend trillions of dollars to put the best fighting force on the field abroad, but when those men and women come home‚Äîoften their bodies broken and with invisible scars‚Äîwe suddenly don't have the resources or will to give them what they deserve. That‚Äôs wrong and must change. https://t.co/7MgdAj8jpV
Today we remember and celebrate the renowned civil rights activist, author, co-founder of the @NAACP, and one of the most important voices of the 20th century, W.E.B. Du Bois, who was born on this day in 1868. #BHM https://t.co/a6FVi4mHt2

My heart is with the loved ones of the victims of the horrific shooting in Aurora, Illinois that has left 5 people dead and more injured.   But we know our thoughts and prayers are not enough. Congress must take action to prevent gun violence. https://t.co/qogz1MZgWJ
Across this country people are surrendering to despair and cynicism about our ability to solve our problems. I‚Äôm running for president because I know when we unite around a common purpose we can change that. https://t.co/97iNvGEJ8b
In South Carolina last weekend I was reminded that even in our darkest moments of despair, we can never give up hope. We can never give up faith. https://t.co/cOgPwb3Od9
For over a century, Congress has failed 200 times to pass legislation recognizing lynching for what it is‚Äîa bias-motivated act of terror. Our bill, just unanimously passed in the Senate, would finally make lynching a federal crime. The House must now act. https://t.co/Rw7uKRk5wc
New Hampshire! Looking forward to spending a long weekend in your beautiful state‚Äîmy first trip to the Granite State as a presidential candidate. Hope to see you there. https://t.co/R2ApGMXUFa
In an atmosphere of cynicism often found in Washington, we‚Äôve found ways to find common ground and get things done that make our country more fair and just‚Äîincluding signing into law our bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that‚Äôs already changing lives across this country. https://t.co/jG7F68weJr
Trump‚Äôs inability to follow through on a campaign promise is not a national emergency.   Let‚Äôs not forget those still struggling to rebuild their lives after this administration failed to respond effectively to real emergencies in places like Puerto Rico. https://t.co/NMSRnvKJQF
The Senate just unanimously passed our bill to make lynching a federal crime. This bill acknowledges the wrongs in our history and honors the memories of those brutally killed. Making this law is the right thing to do‚ÄîI hope the House will move quickly to pass.
One year ago, the #Parkland community lost 17 lives in a heinous act of gun violence. #SinceParkland 1,200 kids in America have been killed by guns. It‚Äôs long past time we unite in common purpose and pass common sense gun safety legislation to prevent more tragedy.
We have a system of mass incarceration that feeds upon the poor, the mentally ill, the addicted, and disproportionately on communities of color. Mr. Barr has shown an unwillingness to call out this broken system. For this reason and more I cannot support his nomination. https://t.co/gJbVEje40K
Edward was one of the first people released after our First Step Act became law. Please listen to his story, and see his humanity and dignity. He‚Äôs now free but there are too many still incarcerated. The war on drugs is a war on people and it must end. https://t.co/unnAXtRvti

The multiple detailed allegations against the Lt. Gov. of Virginia are deeply troubling. They are serious, credible, and corroborated by others. It is no longer appropriate for him to serve. He should resign.
Today marks 51 years since one of the most violent moments in the civil rights movement in Orangeburg, SC where 3 students were killed and 28 people were injured protesting segregation. We honor the victims by continuing their fight for justice &amp; equality. https://t.co/aTHmFGs30U
The first question I was asked in Iowa was about #GreenNewDeal. The hard truth is climate change has imperiled our planet‚Äîit‚Äôs going to take bold action now to save it including dramatic investment in green energy that will create the jobs of the future. We can do this. https://t.co/zdU26AjcNN
Grateful to kick off my first Iowa trip as a presidential candidate surrounded by 5 generations of family at my Aunt Alma's home.

My dad taught me never lose your laugh or take yourself too seriously. That joy isn't something that happens to you‚Äîit‚Äôs a choice you make. He died 6 days before I was elected to the Senate. Death can end a life but can't end a love. https://t.co/oHfEHo1inW
Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Babs Siperstein, a good friend, advocate for NJ‚Äôs LGBTQ community, trailblazer &amp; role model whose legacy will continue to change lives for years to come with the newly-enacted Babs Siperstein Law. My heart is with her loved ones.
Rosa Parks ignited a movement, inspired millions, and embodied the spirit that, no matter what, we can never give in, never give up, never surrender in our work for justice in this nation. Remembering her legacy today on what would have been her 106th birthday. #BlackHistoryMonth

I know that together, we can‚Ä¶ we will, rise.  I hope you‚Äôll join me. https://t.co/NqOSrlvaS7
Despite our divisions, the hatred of some, and the economic hardship of many, together we will ensure that our generation and generations to come will achieve things others say can‚Äôt be done.
When I went down to Washington, people told me it was a place where you couldn‚Äôt make change happen, but I‚Äôve been able to pass laws that start to turn the tide against mass incarceration and spark historic investment in vulnerable communities.
When I moved to Newark to protect tenants from slumlords, people told us we couldn't win. Well, we beat them. When I was mayor, we showed the doubters that impossible things could still happen in our city.
I've spent my entire career running toward big challenges others had given up on, bringing people together to do things that we were told were impossible. That's what our country needs right now.
People feel left out. They worry that the lines that divide us right now are stronger than the ties that bind us. I‚Äôm running to change that.  In America, we have a common pain, common challenges. But what we're lacking is a sense of common purpose.
The promise of our country, that this is a country that works for everyone, is hanging in the balance. When we should be coming together to take on our biggest challenges, there are forces at work trying to split us apart.
I want to take a couple minutes and share a few thoughts about why I‚Äôm running for president:
Thanks for the pic. I miss my dad. He died days before I was elected to The Senate.  He had wise words that kept me grounded. When I graduated Law School: "Boy u got more degrees than the month of July but you ain't hot, life's about the service you give not the degrees you get." https://t.co/A7y05UVKKd
He told me when I was growing up that I was his "stunt double."  Shout out to @JulianCastro for not being the only presidential candidate that has a doppelg√§nger. https://t.co/hxwMlMo4QK
So grateful for your kind feedback. Thank you. https://t.co/gGlLr4t2PE

That is not the call. The call is to unite with people around our shared values and ideals. Too many of us focus on the hate of the some and not the limitless potential strength of the active many.  I am more worried about the silent disengaged many than the hateful active few. https://t.co/HF8f1KtOZH

On the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, here's an alarming fact: 400+ anti-abortion bills passed on the state level since 2010 which means 29 million women live in places hostile to abortion rights.  We must be vigilant in protecting a woman's right to choose. https://t.co/Y3ezTi8ZrH
DAY 32 of #TrumpShutdown. Every day that goes by people hurt. No gas money, credit card debts + bills pile up, mortgages aren't paid, school lunch programs get reduced, programs for Native Americans lose funding... &amp; more. This has to stop. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/Z2KFu2BfsO
Deeply disappointed #SCOTUS decided to temporarily allow the DoD to implement Trump‚Äôs transgender military service ban. This policy is an affront to our values &amp; hurts members of our military. This unjust ban should never be implemented &amp; the courts should strike it down.
It's been 9 years since the Supreme Court handed down its disastrous 5-4 #CitizensUnited ruling. Since then, countless corporate campaign contributions have flooded our elections drowning out the voices of millions of voters‚Äîwe must overturn Citizens United.

We must make #EnvironmentalJustice a rallying cry in 2019. It's unacceptable that Flint &amp; many other communities across America don‚Äôt have clean water or air. Families are drinking &amp; breathing &amp; living toxic materials that can cause serious damage. 6/ https://t.co/z3Ftds1LV6
The fight for equal access to education must continue. Teachers are not paid enough, the school to prison pipeline still exists, black students are suspended 3x more often than their white peers &amp; still face racial discrimination in schools. We must demand better for our kids. 5/
Health care is a human right. Grateful that two of my health care bills were signed into law in 2018 but there‚Äôs more work to do. In 2019 one thing I'm fighting for is passing my MOMMIES Act‚Äîto fix America‚Äôs outrageously high maternal mortality rate. 4/ https://t.co/DAtQV7uc22
King &amp; many other civil rights activists fought for an end to lynching‚Äîso this #MLKDay let‚Äôs recommit to pushing the Anti Lynching Bill over the final hurdles and get it signed into law. Let‚Äôs make 2019 the year lynching is finally a federal hate crime. https://t.co/rAuCS089fV 3/
Criminal justice reform made some huge strides with the First Step Act‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just the beginning. This #MLKDay we need to commit to more change: Marijuana Justice Act, bail reform, juvenile justice, ending the sexual-assault-to-prison pipeline &amp; more. 2/
Happy #MLKDay! In 2019 we must rise to the challenge King left us, to fighting back, demanding change &amp; continuing the eternal march towards justice and equality. That‚Äôs the active way to honor King‚Äôs legacy. 1/ https://t.co/YY5IeApP2z

In under a week, we saw the murders of two African Americans in Kentucky, the anti-Semitic mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue, and mail bombs targeted to political opponents‚Äîall tied together by hatred &amp; bigotry that must be defeated. We as a nation must unite against hate.
My heart is broken over the horrific anti-Semitic acts in Pittsburg and for all affected by the evil shooting at The Tree Of Life Synagogue.   We must counter this hate with love and love's public face which is justice - tireless work for justice and peace.
Grateful for law enforcement's work to bring those responsible to justice &amp; for their vigilance to keep Americans safe. Cowardly acts of terror will never silence or intimidate Americans‚Äîthey will only strengthen our resolve to stand against fear &amp; hatred. https://t.co/Xd2CYgXIHC

My thoughts on Senator Jeff Flake‚Äôs request for an FBI investigation before the Senate #KavanaughVote: https://t.co/8JSpOnvmLG
2018 must be the year the Senate stands up and says a man's job promotion is not worth more than a survivor's pain. For too long, we have allowed a culture that diminishes assault, isolates survivors and blames them. This must change. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/tYRlQGqGyD
Dr. Ford,  Thank you for speaking truth to power. What you did today for survivors across this country, was nothing short of heroic. In awe of your courage and bravery. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/u9uLBFFp1S
"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."  My heart is with the far too many survivors across America for whom this hearing might cause additional pain.   I have hope that truth and justice will prevail.   #BelieveSurvivors
Mr. President, enough.    A Supreme Court nomination is not worth more than the lives of survivors. There must be a full investigation of these allegations of criminal behavior, and Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination must be withdrawn.
Thank you Denzel for stopping by the Senate today to advocate for the Boys and Girls club. It feels good to share a laugh with you and work with you on behalf of our nation‚Äôs kids. https://t.co/MKcZnYSNb5
By scheduling a vote on Judge Kavanaugh before Dr. Ford has even testified, Senate Republican leaders are saying loud and clear: they don‚Äôt care what she says. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/nPXdtSRJ1y

It's time we act to provide better maternity coverage for all women. 4/4 https://t.co/jzoizwERRf
Another unacceptable fact: Black women are more than 3 times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than their white counterparts. 3/
Here's a fact I find unacceptable: between 2000-2014 there was a 26% INCREASE in the maternal mortality rate in the United States. 2/
The only acceptable rate of maternal mortality in the United States is zero. That should be our goal. 1/

In a nation with crisis levels of sexual violence &amp; harassment - how those who come forward are treated demonstrates the level of our commitment to addressing this heinous societal wrong.   The US Senste is again failing to rise and justly deal with a credible accusation. https://t.co/AadURgTu0L
The Senate owes it to Dr. Ford and every survivor of sexual trauma to gather all of the facts before moving forward with this nomination. The Judiciary Committee should not rush a vote on this nomination to a lifetime appointment on our nation‚Äôs highest court.
Dr. Ford is brave to come forward in the face of intimidation and threats to her and her family's safety.   It is wrong to push and bully her toward an artificial date.   Process matters.   This is a defining moment for the Senate.   https://t.co/m1XNF6hyGK 2/3
I strongly support Dr. Ford‚Äôs request for an FBI investigation before holding a hearing. These are serious and credible allegations that should be properly investigated by the FBI, which would be consistent with precedent.
This Yom Kippur, wishing all those who observe, an easy and meaningful fast.
The Senate must not repeat the mistakes it made when Anita Hill bravely came forward with her experience of sexual harassment: https://t.co/u9Ai7Wj5as

In #Helsinki, we did not see an American President or a Commander In Chief. We saw someone behaving like a puppet. https://t.co/4IBRkfZEIl
We were attacked.   We know who did it.   The President embraces them, denies the cyber attacks and attacks the US intelligence community.   The attacks from Russia will continue unless met with strength.   The President is weak and complicit in the ongoing attacks.   Enough!
President Trump should not be able to nominate a #SCOTUS justice while he‚Äôs a subject of a criminal investigation that just resulted in the indictment of 12 Russian government intelligence agents for attacking our democracy in 2016 with the goal of helping Trump get elected.
It‚Äôs a fact that Russia attacked our democracy in 2016 to influence the presidential election in favor of Trump. Today Trump sided with Putin over our own intelligence &amp; law enforcement officials &amp; blamed the US for Russia‚Äôs attacks. Every American should be outraged. #Helsinki
Pres Trump happily greeting Putin on Monday - the man who attacked our county - embracing him as a friend, should OUTRAGE all Americans.   Trump should cancel the meeting or make it an open meeting, confronting Putin on his aggression &amp; taking measures to hold them accountable.
‚ÄúWhen a ‚Äòwitch hunt‚Äô finds ‚Äòwitches‚Äô is it still a witch hunt?‚Äù  An interesting question I got today from @steveliesman.
The Russian government carried out malicious attacks on our 2016 presidential election and our democracy. The threat continues as today‚Äôs Indictments show.   Trump should cancel Monday‚Äôs summit with Putin. If he doesn‚Äôt and fails to confront Putin it‚Äôs Presidential malpractice.

The fact that Kavanaugh believes that a President should not be subject to civil litigation or criminal investigation while in office means that Trump just nominated a justice who has already reached conclusions on these serious questions. That should raise enormous red flags.
President Trump is currently a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation‚Äîthere is a clear conflict of interest inherent in the President nominating someone who could be the deciding vote on a number of potential issues from that investigation that could come before the Court.
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs at stake with Kavanaugh on the Court: the rights of women to make their own medical decisions; the rights of Americans to quality, affordable healthcare; civil rights; voting rights; the rights of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions; &amp; more.
#Happy4thofJuly! As we celebrate &amp; rejoice in America‚Äôs blessings, let‚Äôs also take a moment to reflect on the fact that we in this country are inheritors of a great legacy. We owe a debt for our freedoms that we can‚Äôt pay back‚Äîwe have an obligation to pay it forward.

For that reason, I do not believe the Judiciary Committee should or can in good conscience consider a nominee put forward by this President until that investigation is concluded. 5/5
Should we be considering a Supreme Court nominee from a President who has a history of demanding these loyalty tests and could be responsible for participating in something that could undermine the Mueller investigation?  My answer is, no. 4/
We‚Äôve seen numerous people that are close to the President or on his campaign who have plead guilty ‚Ä¶ and we have a President who in the past seemed to ask people for loyalty tests. 3/
The President of the United States is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation ‚Äì an investigation that every member of the Judiciary Committee knows could end up before the Supreme Court. 2/
Regarding this Supreme Court vacancy: among the many consequential issues at stake, there is clearly a potential conflict of interest for President @realDonaldTrump. 1/

But instead of trying to work with @SenateDems on any of the bills we‚Äôve introduced to lower drug costs for Americans, Trump and @SenateGOP passed their tax bill which resulted in the 10 largest drug companies using their windfall to buy back stock, not to lower drug costs.
Trump should also endorse my bill with @SenSanders &amp; @SenBobCasey ‚ÄúThe Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act‚Äù that would also lower costs by allowing safe importation of drugs from abroad.
If Trump truly wants to lower prescription drug costs he should endorse our bill ‚ÄúImproving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act‚Äù that allows Medicare price negotiation, ensures innovation in developing meds &amp; discourages companies from spiking drug prices.
Trump's announcement today on prescription drug costs is a talking point, not a plan. Trump won‚Äôt allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs. He won‚Äôt allow for importation of drugs from other countries.
It‚Äôs time to not only legalize marijuana, but to expunge the records of those who have been carrying the burdens of past convictions for too long.    Grateful to have my friend &amp; colleague @KamalaHarris cosponsor my bill, the Marijuana Justice Act. https://t.co/ULOnqx8mz6

@LA_Crystal @mattklapper @justicedems @StopBigMoney Crystal, I‚Äôd love to talk to you. When you say I voted against ‚Äúissues‚Äù, I really challenge you to name more than 1 you disagree with (beyond the non-binding pharma vote, which was so misrepresented). Care to take the challenge? Let‚Äôs talk. DM me a number.
I heard from constituents today asking about corporate PAC contributions. I'm joining several of my colleagues &amp; no longer accepting these contributions. Our campaign finance system is broken. I thank @StopBigMoney for their work‚Äîit‚Äôs time to pass campaign finance reform.

I respectfully disagree, they were brought here not of their own volition. They've served from our military to 1st responders, many have put their lives on the line for other Americans.

Do not let your inability to do everything undermine your determination to do something.   We are living testimonies to the millions who, amidst tremendous trials and overwhelming odds, still chose to do something: something to protest, something to resist, something to help.
I was astonished today that a Trump fed judge nominee couldn't answer my questions re: whether he believed implicit racial bias exists in our criminal justice system, saying that even as a former trial judge, he's unfamiliar with the abundance of empirical evidence on this topic. https://t.co/fCLbVL2UJw

You can't lead the people if you don't love the people.   We are leaving too many Americans behind as Trump and Republican leadership fail to provide support for Americans facing hardship and trial. This is a moral moment, not a political one.   We must all stand and speak out. https://t.co/eUoD7PAeBv
Knocked down, Stand up Fall down, Get up Pushed back, Push back  The path toward justice is always fraught with treacherous trials.   No matter what the set back, we must never, ever give up.  Justice will be determined not by size of the obstacle but by the force of our will.
@ashleymariea I hear you.
If this country hasn‚Äôt broken your heart, you probably don‚Äôt love Her enough.
@JulieeRoddy @SenSanders I understand your feelings. Thanks for sharing them. My best to your husband and kids.
My love goes out to the #WomensMarch2018 ‚Äì I'm with you in spirit. Unfortunately, because of the #TrumpShutdown I'm in the Capitol fighting for a solution that gets the government up &amp; running while protecting our military, CHIP funding, Dreamers &amp; more.   We will prevail.
The way forward is clear: Republican leaders and the President must pass a bipartisan solution like the one on the table to reopen the government, restore CHIP, and provide a place in America for DREAMers.     The American people deserve nothing less.
If anything, tonight has revealed once again ‚Äì the President does not have compassion for our fellow Americans who he put in this perilous situation.
But tonight when the President and the Republicans refused to let that bipartisan solution be put forward for a vote ‚Äì it became crystal clear they are willing to play political games with American lives.
And the frustrating thing is ‚Äì there‚Äôs a solution on the table right now. It‚Äôs supported by Republicans, by Democrats, and by most Americans.
President Trump and Congressional Republicans claimed they wanted a DACA solution that would provide relief to the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers who are American in every way except for a piece of paper.
The Republicans control the White House, Senate &amp; House. With that power comes a basic responsibility to keep the government open.     Tonight they failed, and now the American people will suffer. #TrumpShutdown
We need to teach President Trump about love.  Love doesn't build walls, it tears them down. Love means preventing a #TrumpShutdown, while protecting our young American #Dreamers. That's the power of love. https://t.co/djjzdDDAFX
I firmly believe that we can get funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, and find a bipartisan solution for our #Dreamers ‚Äì while also keeping our government open.   The critical question is ‚Äì do @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP?
Food for the soul and inspiration for the heart (better link):   https://t.co/5EtVxUAYUh https://t.co/8FZkm0dV4u
Hours away from a potential government shutdown:  It should NOT be too much to ask that Trump &amp; a @GOP in control of the House &amp; Senate, keep our government running ‚Äì while also finding the humanity to protect our young Dreamers - something they claim to want to do anyway.
Food for the soul and inspiration for the heart:   https://t.co/5EtVxUAYUh
Gillibrand is focused on this year, 2018, not 2020. More than this, Gillibrand is one of the great leaders of our party and her own independent actor. Her moral compass and passion for justice are authentic and this kind of leadership is needed for New York and our nation. https://t.co/NDXVPuuXzp

And it is deeply frustrating that Puerto Ricans are being treated like second-class citizens. We must do better by our fellow Americans. This is a matter of justice.
At the end of the day the Trump Administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been woefully inadequate. We must hold them accountable.
At a minimum, Medicaid funding and the federal matching rate for Puerto Rico &amp; the U.S. Virgin Islands must be temporarily increased to 100%.
I am pushing for Congress to include a Medicaid fix in third emergency disaster relief bill for areas impacted by last year‚Äôs storms, including Puerto Rico. This is crucial. https://t.co/EBPjHKXRf5 https://t.co/KctBY0lops
Up to 1 million Puerto Ricans are at risk of losing their health coverage because of a Medicaid funding shortfall. It is cruel.
Hurricane Maria resulted in the largest blackout in US history. And nearly 4 months after the hurricane hit, 40% of Puerto Ricans are still in the dark. Full restoration of power isn't expected until MAY. That's an unacceptably long time.
Right now there are 3.4 million American citizens in Puerto Rico. They are our neighbors, our fellow citizens and we must do more to protect them in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. https://t.co/0pbrMdDAGw
I am in Puerto Rico to witness &amp; hear first hand from people on the ground working on recovery efforts to rebuild the island. Their calls for help must be heard in Washington. https://t.co/vSNuAsw4Qo

Amidst the chatter, half-truths &amp; out right misrepresentations, those supporting the deportation of El Salvadoran people who have lived in this nation 15+ years, ripping apart families, should do their own research about what role America played in the nation‚Äôs instability. https://t.co/kcN8T6OBel
This decision is just plain cruel &amp; undermines our nation‚Äôs values.

Jeff Sessions is reviving a losing war on marijuana that is devastating low-income Americans &amp; our communities of color and dashing our ideals of equal justice. We can't let this happen.

Amidst an abundance of grief: keep going; keep helping; keep comforting; keep loving; and, by all means, keep demanding justice.
We are not powerless against such evil. We must take common sense, widely supported, steps to reduce such violence, agony and grievous loss.
It is not enough to ask how could someone do this. We must also ask ourselves how can I prevent something like this from happening again.
‚ÄúThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people should do nothing.‚Äù

Vera, I work hard to engage in all manners and make myself very accessible. But please call if you are not satisfied. Connect with @ghelmy. https://t.co/3cdLwWVGGD
It's outrageous, with our high cost of living, people with family need to make about twice the min wage to meet basic needs. #MUSTRAISEWAGE https://t.co/XXXJyPu0c0
@jill_eslinger @msjennam please reach out to @ghelmy to have your question addressed. Thank you.
It is all interconnected. We have allowed the infrastructure to one of the planets most economically productive areas to dangerously decay. https://t.co/TllyvKNvCH
Thanks for your feedback. And thank for listening  . . . . to the raw-ness. https://t.co/heR80WL9Ls
@MarielBrown Sorry you are enduring this. It is unacceptable. I will continue to fight to address it.
@ProgScape Thank you for your kind words.
@ShugNate And this one: https://t.co/Y4yi2SB8jM
@ShugNate Hope you will read the whole article: https://t.co/KwUDzGUFmu
If you or anyone in NJ wants to hear about our progress on the new rail tunnels &amp; the work still to do, reach out to my NJ director @ghelmy https://t.co/i2KdubsPhV
Wow, so grateful for that feedback and that your daughter listened. I am so encouraged to do more of them. . . . Thank you. https://t.co/nM7ygw6vRV
Sleep well. Hope you can share some unexpected kindnesses and random acts of decency tomorrow - they are infections and can go viral. https://t.co/f9OjatnSr7
Yes exactly. I have been working on this for three plus years. Good progress but we must keep fighting and pushing for those tunnels. https://t.co/tt8n7jxOSN
Thank you for being a part of it! https://t.co/nFIBq0KQWR
I haven't and I was just there for the Pride Parade. Sorry I missed it but thanks for the recommendation. https://t.co/9VDJYmY5wN
@MJqqq Sorry for the audio problems in the beginning. We will do more in the future and will work so that issue doesn't happen again.

The current nightmare NJ commuters are dealing with into New York on NJ transit and for other trains is outrageous. Fighting to change this. https://t.co/p1Xh8bckaK
@SMDuke Thank you so much Sara!
@asberry_amanda There can be. But Republicans have to let Dems at the table to start conversations. Now, they are doing healthcare behind closed doors.
A blank is very thought provoking. My best to you Candi. https://t.co/rE697x4XuP

@sjmorris31 @KillerVegan I've got to get there to try it.
@AltLeft2017 U are wrong on so many points: I do support Medicare for all &amp; why don't you read the entire article about "pause" : https://t.co/Cf6fQfA2uv
@kerri_blanchard Kerry, Kushners were a major Dem family years ago that supported many Dem candidates. Dems contributions ended years before Trump presidency
Thank you for this point. And there are other urgent health related issues that we need to keep focused on like environmental toxins. https://t.co/xx3deOvARD
Kerri, you seem confused about me. But I sincerely wish you well and appreciate your advocacy, particularly for environmental justice. https://t.co/dWjztosrbV
You are so right. Many folks don't understand how our broken food systems and food deserts undermine American health. https://t.co/tYkuWzaZA7

Yes. https://t.co/HIJl0MUgtL
@CaptainNoble @EllenDatlow Thanks for being open to the truth.
The Whole Foods at lunch is now a happening place in Newark. Many vegan/vegetarian options. https://t.co/bcR7Dk2BS1
@CaptainNoble @EllenDatlow Thanks Ellen. And please read this too: https://t.co/Cf6fQfA2uv
@chiweethedog Sorry u believe the many Dems who received contributions years ago from a major Dem family (years before they became Repub) is wrong.
@robinAKAroblimo Hope you will read this whole article: https://t.co/Cf6fQfA2uv

My favorite button from all the meetings, rallies and protests this week about the Senate GOP healthcare bill: https://t.co/djiQU05rhN
This is cruel and unbecoming of a 10 year old, not to mention the President of our nation. Enough! Demonstrate dignity or leave the office. https://t.co/9XDlyGrd72

Senate Republicans will try to rally votes, but we will rally the people.   Remember: health care is a human right. https://t.co/WterMDx0mF
They're scrambling for votes; we must rally more resistance. They're whipping GOP Senators; we must rouse public opposition. Stay vigilant! https://t.co/R2Jmj1lYI5
The vote on the Senate GOP craven healthcare plan is delayed but the bill isn't dead. The threat remains. We must fight until it is dead.
@MLCrt01 Thank you Morgan!
@punditshaps Thank you so much for your voice and activism!
@MonicaPirani @pattonoswalt Thank you Monica. Wishing you all the best.
