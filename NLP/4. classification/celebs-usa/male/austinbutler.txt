Captivating TED talk about your elusive creative genius by Elizabeth Gilbert: http://t.co/VLcBgLGQ2M
Keep the channel open.  -- Martha Graham
You do not even have to believe in yourself or the work. You have to keep open and aware directly to the urges that motivate you.
It is your business to KEEP IT YOURS, clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.
It is not your business to determine how good it is, nor how it compares with other expressions.
This expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium; and be lost. The world will not have it.
There is a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and there is only one of you in all time.
