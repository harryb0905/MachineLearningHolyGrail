Although I’m very impressed with your decision wins against Vinicius Kappka de Queiroz, Tony Johnson, Oil Thompson, and Augusta Saki 😁 since your last LOSS to King Mo, I have not made my mind up on which belt I will defend. https://t.co/wPtiOOmRTh
Cheick you’re bad at this. I ko’d the guy who gave you your last loss and one of the greats both in under a minute. YOU’RE bringing up decisions?? Stop, it’s comedy. Plus @mattmitrione would whoop your ass. https://t.co/hwvjURMc4q
@aaronsimpson @BellatorMMA @AssholeBader 🤷‍♂️
Who’d you just beat? I fell asleep. Yeah @BellatorMMA just gave me the belt, not like I won the heavyweight tourney or anything. Sorry you weren’t invited to the party https://t.co/wPtiOOmRTh
Hey congrats @kongo4real but you talk like that after that performance 😬?? There is a reason you weren’t invited into the Heavyweight Grand Prix, what’s that tell you??? I’ll let YOU know what title I decide to defend. Until then, excuse my FRENCH &amp; f*ck off https://t.co/Npgl56H7pG
About to tear up a game show with these legends @chuckliddell @xcnatch https://t.co/5NIcgiHpoz
@arielhelwani I can attest that they do randoms. Mitrione and I were tested a couple times leading up to our fight.
