@P_JACKSON1 I dig that part
Fans are mean as SHIT‼️‼️😂 Gotdamn
@P_JACKSON1 But he didn’t tho, and they will be ok there is a game 2 lol
Y’all gotta Lay off my guy JR, he will redeem himself game 2 for sure. He score in double figures and that’s what the Cavs need, he’ll be ok.

Chris doesn’t have a ring but what he’s done matters
This championship pedigree time, Houston needs Chris right now more than ever.
It got ugly for those guys over at Christian lol https://t.co/xuTIAZZd7A
Yes but i shoot the shit out the ball so as a competitor No 😂 but he number 1 and from Charlotte, we both are top 13 in history tho so I’m like 🙌🏾🙌🏾 you got it brother lol https://t.co/Bnnmto62jK
@DakotaSemrad Just saying what they would’ve liked to have lol
@DruProductions @TeamLou23 That plus Lou lol
I grew up with steph, he was a late bloomer. But if you left him open it was cash money records lol the turned into somn special tho.
It matters in the playoffs tho lol https://t.co/0jdV9joddz
Series would’ve been over if Golden State had a version of Eric Gordon. Anybody that can come off the bench and score 30 or 40. My guy @TeamLou23 would be perfect.
Ariza* lol https://t.co/nscHPsrDAt
*Ariza
Regardless of what Trev Aroza does offensively he’s a super ex factor guy, 3 and D, toughness, championship pedigree, he is under paid as far as I’m concerned #intangibles
Kevon Looney has played well all season and taken advantage of his opportunity I love that kinda stuff
This is James’ moment too, he’s gotta transcend
This KDs moment he gotta transcend
That shot James hit shoulda counted

Hard Money ✊🏾💪🏾 https://t.co/GFvXZSSv3K
@THUNDERUPSWAGG It’s a y’all task but he might have to depending on Chris’ health
Klay is one of the few players that can catch the basketball when he’s open, shot fake and then still get the shot off and it’s still a good shot 😂 #QuickDraw
James might have to score 60+ if chris isn’t healthy, gotta have all immediate role players in double figures too tho. #WCF #Game7

💯💯 preciate that bro https://t.co/77nSIhEuyC
When I see these new guys rap 'beef' I'm never worried lol it's just Ig and snap chat posts lol anytime u hear somebody like beans tho 😳
Ain't no in between now, we talkin anout Beanie Sigel and potentially some other ppl in his own city, I pray it doesn't go past just rap.
Beans put in too much work, he too respected to violated like that and in his own city that shouldn't happen to a legend smfh.
I hate to see Beanie Sigel caught up in this new rap game stuff. It ain't like it was back when he was at the top, there's no respect now.

I'm from the projects, high gang violence high crime, but I would hate for my mom or dad to be frisked every single day, that's not right.
I'm sure that a lot of people that have never been in an inner city in their lives would be cool with 'stop and frisk'
