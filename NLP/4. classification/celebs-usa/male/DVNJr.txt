@MikeGeorge83 Fans are frustrated because they let go players who are now overachieving. I get it. But the relaxed expansion draft rules didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrig‚Äù it. Vegas outsmarted more than a few teams. And they also had quite a bit of luck, which any team needs if they make it this far.
@MikeGeorge83 What do you propose we call them... ‚ÄúOur beloved players who escaped?‚Äù Or ‚Äúthe really great ones that got away?‚Äù
@hawleylaw @BobHarig @methsaas22 @DailyNorseman It was not a ‚Äúsevere‚Äù change, as Bob says: 11 protected skaters in 2000 vs. 10 skaters this time isn‚Äôt a radical change. Vegas also made a dozen smart trades. Its success is rooted, in part, to other GMs mistakes &amp; misjudgments.

I love how some fans keep grumbling that the Vegas Golden Knights‚Äô success is ‚Äúrigged‚Äù because the NHL relaxed its expansion draft rules. They did (only slightly), but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact Vegas will skate for the Cup with players everyone else in the league didn‚Äôt want.

Last night, Barbara Bush drank a bourbon. All day today, George, her husband of 73 years, held her hand and was by her side when she passed away.
After her husband hit two spectators with golf balls at the Bob Hope Classic in 1995, Barbara Bush quipped, ‚ÄúAs if we don‚Äôt have enough violence on television.‚Äù

@mikefreemanNFL Mike, Arnie popularized golf in America. Alone. He invented sponsorships. Tiger is important but more important than Arnie (or Jack and his 18 majors)? It‚Äôs a ludicrous take. Read Arnie by Tom Callahan or any other history of 20th century golf.
Arnie *made* golf, but okay. https://t.co/kDgY0yG8Hf
