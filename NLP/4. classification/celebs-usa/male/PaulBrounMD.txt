I'm 100% Pro-Gun and I support National Constitutional Carry. #2ndAmendment #ProGun #gapol https://t.co/zISbBR25An
I will not only fight to stop the gun grabbers, but to eliminate existing barriers to gun ownership as well. #gapol #2ndAmendment #ProGun
DC v. Heller ruled that you have an individual right to own firearms. I will fight for legislation that reinforces this ruling. #ProGun
Your God-given right to own firearms should not be infringed by any government.
We can't allow Establishment Politicians to sneak amnesty into immigration "reform." My No Amnesty bill would prevent this from happening.
We need to cut govt spending, balance the budget, and use the savings to pay down the debt.
I have never voted to raise taxes or the debt ceiling. In fact, I voted to lower the debt ceiling because spending is out of control.
.@Douglas_Collins Your schedule looks a little light. When will you announce attendance at the rest of these? https://t.co/al7oq0UGBx #gapol
Establishment Doug only plans to attend 4/9 events. He should stand in front of ALL voters and explain his vote to fund Planned Parenthood.
Check out my FULL debate and forum schedule. I plan on being at every candidate event in the district. #gapol https://t.co/al7oq0UGBx
I've been endorsed by conservative groups across the nation. They know I'll actually fight for our values. https://t.co/lXu6NFBbIL

My Patient OPTION Act makes the market based reforms necessary to fix our healthcare system. I plan to introduce it my first week in office.
It would modernize Medicare, expand HSAs, allow purchases across state lines, and make all health expenditures tax deductible. #gapol
My Patient OPTION Act would do just that and more. It would free up the healthcare market to be more efficient. #gapol
Obamacare is a disaster for healthcare. We need to fully REPEAL it. #gapol

Thank you for your support, William. Govt spending must be cut! I actually proposed more targeted cuts than anyone.  https://t.co/QpWVTXuzjA
The free market leads to prosperity across social classes. That's why I support it. https://t.co/OYeeqy5JKr
That's why so many people encouraged me to run. And it's why I decided to. I'll always fight for small govt, even against the Establishment.
People in the Ninth are fed up with these kind of votes. They're ready for a Congressman who has a record of fighting the Establishment.
In 2015, with his constituents again urging him not to vote for Boehner, Establishment Doug did it again.
It was clear Boehner wasn't, so I voted for Allen West. Meanwhile, Establishment Doug ignored his constituents and voted for Boehner.
I was one of the first Republicans to vote against John Boehner for Speaker. I wanted someone who would actually stand up to Obama! #gapol
Hey Doug, wanna compare our votes in 2013? While we're on it, how'd you vote last year? https://t.co/DMsFkWFmil https://t.co/HiqaJL0PQp

Hey @politicalinsidr and @bluestein, listen to my new radio ad yet? https://t.co/Zi1V2PahhV
I’d appreciate your vote and I’d be glad to talk to you personally about my positive record. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
I have a record of fighting the Establishment. I voted against Boehner as Speaker. I opposed ALL Omnibus bills.  https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
My record shows I’m a consistent, conservative, constitutionalist. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
Attack ads can’t change a voting record. So I’m proud to talk about mine. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
That's YOUR store Nancy Pelosi is talking about. I guarantee Nancy Pelosi will never say that about me. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
Nancy Pelosi said Establishment Doug Collins and other Republicans "really gave away the store," on Omnibus. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
Then he voted for Boehner’s Omnibus Bill that fully funds Planned Parenthood, Obamacare, and Obama’s amnesty plan. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
Establishment Doug Collins voted for Boehner for Speaker. Twice. Even after you told him not to. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
My daddy told me a half truth is a whole lie. And the whole truth is he’s desperate to distract you from his record. https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0
Establishment Politician Doug Collins' personal attack ads are full of distortions and half-truths.  https://t.co/lqxIWmc8a0

Had a great time speaking to the NE GA Tea Party last night about how I'm fed up with Washington politics as usual. https://t.co/g70jGCS9oa
In Congress, I authored the Sanctity of Human Life Act, a 100% Pro Life bill. #ProLife #gapol
It's one thing to be pro life. It's another to fight for it. I will always fight for life, even if it costs me popularity contests. #ProLife
Make no mistake, a vote to fund Planned Parenthood is a vote to fund abortions. #ProLife #DefundPP #gapol
Planned Parenthood gets half a billion in taxpayer funds. Every dime the govt gives them is a dime freed up in their budget for abortions.
I'm a strong advocate for the 2nd Amendment. Americans have the right to defend themselves. #2ndAmendment
I always side with individual liberty versus federal government intrusion. It's a natural right for all Americans, including the unborn.
The greatest economic engine in history is our free enterprise system. We must set it free to work at maximum efficiency once again.
In Congress, I authored and sponsored the No Amnesty plan. Can I count on your support so I can do it again? https://t.co/rt0oLJ55DX
My prayers this morning are with the people of Brussels. We must stand strong in the fight against ISIS and terror across the globe.
I stood firm in the fight to fully repeal Obamacare. I never caved to liberal demands or Establishment pressures. #RepealIt #gapol
When I tell voters I'll do something, I do it. It's not just a campaign promise. It's my duty to them. #IntegrityMatters
A vote to fund Planned Parenthood is a vote to fund abortion. No amount of Washington Double Talk can change that. #DefundPP #gapol
We have 19 trillion dollars in debt. That's an injustice to our kids and grandkids. It has to stop. #gapol
I've been in Washington and I never changed. I fought the Establishment from my first day to my last. I'm prepared to do it again. #gapol
They have let down the grassroots too many times. We need to take our party and our country back starting right here at home. #gapol
I feel betrayed by the Republican Establishment. They have failed to stay strong when standing up to liberal demands. #gapol
I was 1 of only a few Republicans to vote against John Boehner in 2012. I wanted a Speaker who would actually stand up to Obama! #gapol

I'm sick and tired of politicians ignoring their constituents. They forget that they work for the voters, not the other way around. #gapol
#IntegrityMatters! That's why I'm running a campaign based on issues, not personal attacks. On record, not rhetoric.
You're absolutely right. Omnibus bills are bad practice in general. Even worse when they fund Obama's agenda!  https://t.co/NAF0Kne1HK
That means no omnibus bills. Especially if they fully fund Planned Parenthood! #DefundPP #prolife #gapol
We absolutely must defund Planned Parenthood. #prolife #DefundPP #gapol
Planned Parenthood is guilty of egregious sins. We need leaders who won't cave to liberal demands and will fight to defend life. #gapol
I'm strongly pro life with a record to prove it. I've never budged on defending life, even when the Establishment pressured me to. #gapol
Without borders, we aren't a country. I oppose amnesty because I support rule of law. #SecureOurBorders
Under ObamaCare, the quality of health care decreases, cost increases, and taxes go up. I will never vote for any bill that funds it.
Cutting spending is not merely reducing the rate of growth in spending. We need real cuts and a strong Balanced Budget Amendment. #gapol
We have to do more to help our Veterans. They fought to protect our freedom. We owe them the best. #gapol #Veterans
I describe myself and my approach to public service in three very simple words: Christian. Constitutionalist. Conservative.

.@Merwinlee My JOBS Act would make corporate and capital gains rates permanently zero, which would spark incredible growth and #job creation
4) New EPA MACT rules requiring expensive tech with nearly no direct health benefits: cost +$38 billion, +400,000 #jobs
3) NRLB is trying to prevent Boeing from opening a plant in SC b/c they aren’t union-friendly - plant would create thousands of #jobs.
2) Stimulus $ study on food advertising: proj -$28.3 billion in sales and -378,000 #jobs – just to keep Chester the Cheetah off the air
1) New EPA standards they admit are trivial. Total cost: up to $90 billion per year, with as many as 7.3 million #jobs lost by 2020
The President wants to spend $447 billion on this plan. Instead we could just reign in his Admin & their restrictive policies. Examples:
.@MaryVanBrink Amen!!!
.@awarriorssoul The announced cost for this plan is almost half a trillion dollars that we do not have.
@joshua_eaton people who create jobs outside of government: i.e. small business owners
.@Johnemcc Congress passed the President's stimulus and we now have 1.7 million fewer jobs. Those plans failed; it's time to change course
.@MythChick I am for everyone paying their fair share, which is why I support fundamental tax reform, such as the FairTax

I am glad the President agrees with one portion of my #JOBS Act – extending 100% business expensing into 2012.
We need to stop the outrageous spending, stop creating debt, and allow the entrepreneurial spirit of America to flourish.
The way to create jobs is to remove restrictions & tax burdens from job creators and the private sector. Big gov't plans have clearly failed
Good campaign speech, but no new ideas. Just bigger government and more debt. At least he's admitting we need to fix Medicare.
My JOBS Act, HR 660, would immediately help job creators do just that - create permanent, private sector #jobs
I am disappointed that this has largely been a campaign speech advocating the same old failed big government ideas and deficit spending.
What do you think of his proposals?
Bur you want to protect actions by the NLRB and the EPA that have negligible effect but destroy hundreds of thousands to millions of #jobs?
Yes Mr. President, we do need to eliminate many of those regulations
Pass the #fairtax and reduce spending if you really want to create a stronger economy, Mr. President
This is obviously political grandstanding and class warfare.
The #FairTax is the best way to end loopholes, make sure folks pay their fair share, & reform our tax code for long term #job growth.
The President himself has admitted raising taxes is incorrect & kills jobs in a recession. Why is he so against simply reducing spending?
How can you stabilize the debt while proposing to spend more money?
Federal infrastructure projects are inefficient and never shovel-ready. We need to let states plan their spending, not fed. bureaucrats
I agree that a payroll tax cut will help get some of the burden off of our middle class, but the tax credit has been tried and failed
14 million people are still out of work since the last big government plan, 1.7 million fewer since the original #stimulus.
Do you think that the fed gov’t restricting domestic energy production has hurt #job growth? #tcot
While we wait, what is the number 1 thing you would do to help create #jobs and grow the economy? #tcot

As a US Marine I know allowing open gays in the military will destroy unit cohesiveness. It is a terrible idea.
Earmark reform, Mr. President? Your so-called stimulus was full of earmarks!! Talk is cheap.
Obama has created more debt in one year than Bush did in 8 years. We must cut spending, not just freeze it.
He is still promoting Obamacare. He doesn't get it. America doesn't want a govt takeover. I offered Obama a plan that will do all he asked.
Government-run health care is not reform.  It’s a take-over. We must lower the costs and let doctors and patients make the decisions not gvt
The best way to create new real jobs is by leaving $ in small businesses pocket.
The stimulus has NOT worked. We were promised unemployment would not go above 8%. It is over 10% now.
