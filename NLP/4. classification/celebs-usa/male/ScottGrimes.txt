@2muchcoffee4me Yes it does.
@Toshogu I love sushi. I was just making a point but I chose the wrong food. I should have said liver
if I said ‚Äú I don‚Äôt like sushi‚Äù, would the people who like sushi insult me and threaten to hurt me and boycott My show? , Because that‚Äôs what happened yesterday when I said I did not like Donald Trump as a human being. Unreal. I truly don‚Äôt understand this platform.
@fischeracademy @realDonaldTrump You are so rude. I said nothing about you. Absolutely nothing. I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre an amazing person. Thank you for your rude tweet yet mine was not pointed towards you whatsoever. Cheers
@GalaxieLover @realDonaldTrump I said nothing about you so do not speak to me that way. I would appreciate that thank you
@TerriJD30 @realDonaldTrump No need to forgive. Cheers
@wschott35 @realDonaldTrump Ha!!! Good one!! You got me!
@Dr_StephLynn @realDonaldTrump I didn‚Äôt say he hasn‚Äôt done those things. I said he is a bully
@WayOFtheDOVE @Floridaguy74656 @realDonaldTrump Ha!!! Good one!!! You got me!!!
@JeramieLorson @realDonaldTrump How is this relevant? I have to be someone to have an opinion?
@jimbumgarner @realDonaldTrump Is that what I said? My goodness. I don‚Äôt like this man plain and simple. I think he is a bully. That‚Äôs all I said
@SteveKlemetti @realDonaldTrump Absolutely respect your opinion. I don‚Äôt agree but that‚Äôs my ears. I appreciate the conversation though.
@Floridaguy74656 @realDonaldTrump Oh my god that made me laugh so much. Good for you
@Floridaguy74656 @realDonaldTrump Ha!!!
@realDonaldTrump Dude, you are such a child. Your desire to insult people is staggering to me. If you were even a tiny bit presidential I would at least listen to you. You represent everything I grew up fighting against and I can‚Äôt believe you are the president of this country I love.
@edgas @NadegeCornen @russellcrowe @alanthomasdoyle @carlfalkmusic @IGPmusic After you asked him first of course right?

@markjacksonacts @JenDBradley It is unfair that you have insider information. I know people. You will be taken care of immediately
@thejacques4 @JenDBradley Really good shoes. You know the shoes I‚Äôm talking about. We don‚Äôt buy them for that, but they do the job
@CheriEagleson Oh my god that is so cool. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve heard that. I‚Äôm impressed and honored
@JenDBradley 5‚Äô9
@JoelDoubleyou @funnyordie It‚Äôs a shame that more people cannot see this beautifully hysterical response. Nice one
@dayna1975 @Luv4ScottGrimes @jessicaszohr Oh yes
@BrittanyLampka @scottwolf What a great time. I‚Äôm so glad you loved it. One of the best times of my life!  I was lucky to be on it and lucky to work with Mr. Wolf and all the cast
@PeterWigginX13 @joncassar @TheOrville Thank you so much. I appreciate the response.

@AronEisenberg @Polish_Post @LostGirl08_LINZ @TheAlphaQuadrnt @GarrettRWang @TheOrville @EvelDick You‚Äôre both pretty. Hey, I liked ‚ÄúMelrose Place‚Äù so WTF do I know
@AronEisenberg @LostGirl08_LINZ We are trying to be funny but also tell a serious story. Of course it could be funnier but we are not going for that. For me, being a fan of the genre, I think it‚Äôs the perfect combination but I am not the person to ask. I also like Twinkies.

No joke, every time I hear Jon Bon Jovi‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there for you‚Äù and he says ‚Äú these five words I swear to you‚Äù I make sure it‚Äôs five words by counting on my hand. I don‚Äôt care how many times I‚Äôve heard it. I somehow really want him to be wrong
@joemoulesjr I told him to sing it. I‚Äôm just as much of a victim as you and him. I want it more than anything in the world
@CheriEagleson thanks Cheri
@arrowhofshield ha!!!! Love it!!!

@sneakin ha!!!
@sneakin your tweets have this amazing way of riding a fine line of rudeness and feeling like you are poking the bear. Is it on purpose? If it is I want no part of it anymore. Thank you for reading this.
If you haven‚Äôt seen @SteveMartinToGo and #martinshort ‚Äòs #netflix special, then I am completely judging who you think you are as a human being!!! It will make you smile until sound comes out of your mouth!

With all that‚Äôs going on in the world I find it difficult to talk about my own problems but this one has gone too far. I‚Äôm not trying to be funny, I legitimately cannot seem to ever find the expiration date on any product. Is there an insider trick?

@Luv4ScottGrimes Change the decisions you make. Problems are going to come at you all the time. The difference is how you deal with them. Be kind, and forgiving, and work hard. I don‚Äôt think that was profound but it‚Äôs what I believe in. And I believe in you
