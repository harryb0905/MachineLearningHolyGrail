@SecOfState7O Pompeyo tries to wrest title of president for foreign affairs from @JohnBoltonAMB, leaving @realDonaldTrump again outside the loop! But @VP Pence coming up on the outside as he pushes for military action in Venezuela. https://t.co/jZsjUYhGji

Look how well using humanitarian aid as a weapon to foster regime change has worked so far. https://t.co/Q4yOw1tQe1
The president for foreign affairs continues US campaign for regime change. https://t.co/i1HDqqceVU
Good dance sequences and time travel. Really what more is there? https://t.co/HJ84QgtrZs
So we’re back in the regime change biz. And using humanitarian aid as a weapon. Thank you president Bolton https://t.co/gKVrdmtw2R
Using humanitarian aid to foster regime change? Where have we heard that one before? https://t.co/hOx6XSjiO0

This is all true with the exception of the coffee https://t.co/EKRnn08Jbt
Nope John Bolton, the president for foreign affairs, got a more presentable front man. https://t.co/65qq3DOMMX
O my god! What will Bloomberg do? https://t.co/esOoMSa6tc
Nope. In the year of the woman, a brainy black female rocks the political spectrum. Especially given how old white guys are running the country https://t.co/5A29Wdwi6I

Time for @realDonaldTrump to brave the elements and stage a be-in at the Capitol with both of his remaining followers https://t.co/PzvVFTxvYj
@realDonaldTrump can stage a sit-in on the Capitol steps. Oops, forgot about the bone spurs https://t.co/JOSt967yXE

It will take a tragedy to end the shutdown, like a plane crash, poisoned  food outbreak or @realDonaldTrump blocked from national television https://t.co/izxFaMzCSp
I wonder if @realDonaldTrump has the balls to sit in at the Capitol if they block him from the State of the Union? He probably doesn’t have the knees
But for more than 40 percent of America, being racist is a good thing https://t.co/nnnD3i1D6x

Why does anyone think LA is a pro football town? Look what it took to bring an NFL team to LA where municipal leaders like the revenue from teams while the fan base is ho-hum at best https://t.co/EkmwXdwArS
Still easier to count the times @realDonaldTrump has told the truth. https://t.co/02fEQi6cQc
If @realDonaldTrump is proposing an immigration bill, it has to be many steps backward. His administration can’t help itself to be other than reactionary

At least one elected official stands up. If only there were an elected school board in Los Angeles. Oh wait .... https://t.co/wkK7TeJXKA
Nope. Chuck and Nancy are cautious politicians who would work in the background to push out Trump but could never do them both at the same time. If Mueller indicts Pence then it is a different game. https://t.co/hnTHJHDKqA
Sadly, there is an elected school board that has been absent without leave. https://t.co/LGDO31Rzqf
Nashville New Orleans... they are just rooms in the White House where @realDonaldTrump is all alone https://t.co/yjp371yRDq

Pence survives because @realDonaldTrump is pushed out of office by his own people invoking constitution rules to get rid of sick nuts. After Pence is Pelosi and GOP can’t take a chance that she might get in. https://t.co/c7tpF9POP3
We know how this ends: Pence as president, the government reopens, the wall becomes a truck stop and US troops never leave Syria. The only question is when. https://t.co/PxKb9lNP2U

Do not underestimate how far Trump and the GOP moved in trying to save Kavanaugh nomination. Bullying, denial , lashing out at your opponents are engrained responses. Being civi is not the default position
So what happened to all those tough Republicans who screamed about Dem conspiracy, corrupt politics and defended due process? They realized they needed a fig-leaf FBI probe to get to 50
Another vote for a fig leaf probe! Time to allow polling https://t.co/9rR5YmNbgS

The only good thing about the anonymous op-ed in the NYT is that Trump May screw up enough courage to fire everyone— except Ivanka
No. Op-Ed’s are a different species than a book. And Woodward as a journalist is not the same as an unfiltered public official hiding behind a self-woven cape of patriotic heroism https://t.co/Z74vGlGa8m
You can eliminate Trump. The document is in English https://t.co/lGBaUF1inA
No. This use of anonymity guarantees that the official can pretend to be heroic even while enabling the administration he serves to carry out terrible policies. There is no secret place for public officials who shirk their accountability https://t.co/7R2MQgoUtw
Anonymous self-praise from an alleged Trump official. Op-Ed’s are often designed to be self-serving but they should never be unsigned. How can I as a reader know what to make of this other than an attack on the president from ambush from someone who claims to be a hero? https://t.co/Y434Ai2NKS
