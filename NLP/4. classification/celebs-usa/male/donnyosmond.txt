#OTD 1974 MJ &amp; I hosted the 1st @AMAs. We did the best we could to deliver the painfully-written lines without bursting into laughter.  Best #memory of the night was afterwards when @michaeljackson &amp; I ate 🌮s out of the sunroof of my limo while driving down Sunset Blvd. https://t.co/60T6ig82R9

When we recorded #OneBadApple🍎 in #MuscleShoals, we had no idea the song would slingshot us to the top of the charts.  On February 13, 1971, #OneBadApple became our first #1 hit record &amp; stayed there for 5 weeks.  #WBW #OTD #TheOsmonds  https://t.co/4JmDjQeNv0

To tell you the truth, I thought the #superbowlhalftime would've been sort of okay if it sounded better. The mixing was terrible... not #SuperBowl quality. I like where your head's at, @DarleneMize... #GoPats! 🏈🏆 https://t.co/4rmXhMLe3K
So, what did everyone think about the #SuperBowlhalftime show? 🤔 #SuperBowlLIII

Writing music 5 days after shoulder surgery is a little harder than I thought it would be. Maybe I should call this song "Shoulder of Love.“ 😆   Do you have any clever titles for the new album? #RecoveryMode #NewMusic https://t.co/TCj91kA8bO

If you put @DonnyOsmond in a #Silverado, will that make the truck more rock ‘n’ roll? 😜  I’ve never owned a Chevy #Silverado, but it sounds like it’s time to test one out. What do you say, @chevrolet? Can you make it happen?   https://t.co/WoUT4oHZ3g

Deeply saddened to hear about #RoyClark's passing. We loved his visits on the #DonnyandMarie show. Roy was hilarious, professional &amp; a phenomenal musician.

Debbie &amp; I have been happily married for 40 years, &amp; I'm grateful every day of my life that she's by my side.
2. My wife, who I first met at an #EltonJohn concert in 1976. She happened to be on a date with my brother Jay (yes, you read that correctly). I remember looking over at her during #YourSong and thinking to myself, "I'm going to marry that girl."
1. My parents, who instilled in each of their children a deep love and appreciation for music. Their #GiftofMusic has shaped my entire life.
This ad blew me away, @eltonofficial @jlandpartners. It hits home on so many levels. After watching, I'm feeling particularly #grateful for two things: https://t.co/PWXLpNPwn1

This week in 1972 #CrazyHorses reached #14 on #BillboardHot100 &amp; #2 in the UK. The song was initially banned from a number of countries bc they thought it was about drug usage.

As I was leaving their dressing room after the show, James told me that they used to do an Osmond song in their set list. Can you imagine #Metallica doing #PuppyLove? 😂 No… it was Crazy Horses. https://t.co/AgbTEhjpnE
I remember this @Metallica concert well. It was in Long Beach back in ’86. What I remember most was the musicianship. I don’t recall who was on bass. I think it was Jason Newsted. He was crazy good. Of course, James Hetfield was amazing as well. Ok, the whole band was amazing! https://t.co/KWqgnFrllf
