How was ertz a catch and dezs wasnt
Man the vikings just straight choked. That was a completely different team that showed up
@kingpete26 you inspired me last night homie. Fuckin warrior
@levtowner73 I kinda want the eagles since wentz is out and every one can stop comparing him and dak. 1st rd pick vs 4th
@realDonaldTrump The only danger ive been in down there was being falsely accused of having drugs by the we‚Äôll trained heroic border patrol agents. 3 times now never had any thing
Any body else notice how all the coaches jerry jones cut loose are about to or have won super bowls? I have
Trump check ya boy tell him to calm th fuck down! we havin fun out here
Fucking garbage as fuck in jerry world. Run the fucking ball and you score right there
Man dallas is the one team where the fans know more than the fucking coaching staff. Jerry i sure hope garretts butt hole is awesome cause your team is fuct behind your relationship
Seattle tryin to hand them this game and they still find a way to fuck it up
Dez dez dez soon as he started talkin. Then his ass scared to make the tackle. Fuckin loud mouth fuck up
Hahahahha put dez on suicide watch ! He lookin crazy ! Hahaha
Dez finally got the ball after all that cryin look what he do
Damn it bailey ! Get heath out there! Hahaha
Good to have the general back
The choosen 1 dak
@t_rav46 He would be good if they used him better if the coach was creative at all
@t_rav46 Hahaha mfer
Hopefully the giants can get dallas to shut this garbage ass season down and get that draft pick.  What if they got a new coach.  garrett sucks
@t_rav46 Dez keeps it up
Drops
Burfict got some karma in that ass
@levtowner73 They should let tyrone sit the rest of the year but i bet garrett wont. Non coachin ass wanna save his job. ‚ÄúWere just gonna tweak the game plan‚Äù , mofo you need a lot more than a tweaking  yall suck ass 3 weeks in a row. Worst team in the league
@WestKatz I wish hed just get new coaches already then die
Have yall read what jerry been sayin?! Dallas aint goin no where till hes gone or he quits playin favorites with this coaching staff
@bryanrowley Ive asked myself the same thing
Jerry should fire the entire coaching staff. This team quit the last 2 weeks
Dude i hope hes just tryin too hard. Damn.
Damn watching dak play these last 2 weeks is like walking in on my parents having sex. Like finding out santa clause is fake.

Hey Jerry..,...... GOFF GOFF GOFF GOFF GOFF GOFF GOFF!!!! 542 yds passing in a comeback come dude make it happen
Its just stupid he was in there in the first place. 3 picks i bet due to being baked on pain meds.
Get goff jerry make that shit happen trade hardy for that pick
@tonyromo so sorry homie you are a fucking warrior
@PCB_80 dude its just nuts. Jerry actually thought they had a shot at a s.b. And went for broke and got tony broke
I just god damned fucking knew it. Jerry crazy as hell.
So stupid he needed surgery. Thats why they had him all doped up
Dude i know this team too well.
Bad move jj i told your stupid ass so many times.
I been saying it since they said he was coming back early. I fucking knew it. Senseless
I called it fuck i knew he was gonna get hurt
Romo looks high. Shot his ass up at half time i bet
Their just not ready simple as that. What do positions do yall think they need ? I think qb,cb,safety,rb. DEPTH they have none
All the shit i talk on here jj wouldnt let me play a half time show. Maybe not let me in the stadium at all. But im a mega. Fan/idiot
