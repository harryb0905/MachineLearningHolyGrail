Hey @UberEats how do you allow your delivery partners to use a bike and also make multiple deliveries at the same time esp when it’s cold outside. My food is always cold. I’d rather get option b4 I order #UberEATS #uber 17min for food from a few blocks away? #smdh https://t.co/pVsBPndVis

@TheDJMoneyGreen Art is difficult to perform if you’re under pressure. I always say “you can’t rush a genius” and it’s true.

@damnit_mann How do you think all of these wack rappers are charting
@damnit_mann Well 2018 people will fabricate anything to become popular then monetize. Don’t believe anything you see or hear 😭

@AOLSupportHelp I can sign in through the web yes! Just cannot add an account via IPhone. Tried for 2 days

@freedom_moates @DJTMentionsBot @realDonaldTrump Of course you’d say it’s fake news. There are plenty of charts and data proving his low approval rating since presidency. Just google it, I don’t have the time but it’s no secret
@freedom_moates @DJTMentionsBot @realDonaldTrump That did not back up your claim. If you want to analyze approval ratings there’s a much better site. He’s ranked very low. I can pull more stats when I get the time cheers https://t.co/PnHt315qEC
@freedom_moates @DJTMentionsBot @realDonaldTrump Reply with proof
@freedom_moates @DJTMentionsBot @realDonaldTrump My honest opinion, he’s hated more than loved. I believe there are stats to back this up which makes it a fact. I was being generous by saying it was an opinion

Music Entrepreneurship is probably the most important thing to learn in order to win at making and monetizing your music in today’s climate #professor #Entrepreneurship #music
The concept of signing to a major distributor/record label is about to become a thing of the past now that #Spotify is signing indie artists directly. Offering artists a higher royalty rate, hefty advances, non exclusivity, and master ownership is about to kill the majors.

There are rules to battle rapping now? This is too political to be #hiphop #drake #PushaT
#Drake said he’s sticking to love songs #PushaT #rap
Looks as if #drake is not coming back outside to play. The street light is on 😩
Dear Drake, the longer you take, the more we believe @PUSHA_T #memo #psa
Only if original artist was a writer on the original then this applies. https://t.co/8CHX9VUHgG
To my music connoisseurs: I see a lot of you googling writer credits. Understand that the composer of music is ALSO a songwriter and listed in the credits as such. The contribution may NOT be lyrics or words but are still a contributing songwriter and in fact own 50% of the song.
Love this ♥️ https://t.co/W8XcO0Zqzb

The famous orchestra hit was recorded in 1919 by Russian composer, Stravinsky then later recorded into the first sampling keyboard, the Fairlight Synthesizer which was invented in Australia back around 1975. Crazy how production and music evolved and has been recycled. #music

We just rejoined you this morning. Great price great speed. Not sure why people would join any other ISP honestly https://t.co/N92G66oyBc
The biggest scam is @optimum home WiFi they offer YOUR signal to everyone as a hotspot which thins out your bandwidth and gives a horrible browsing experience. They also charge more than @verizonfios for half of the speed 🤔
Why does @IamAkademiks even entertain the fact to think #Tekashi69 Teriyaki is a king of NY and he’s only a boy that’s been in the industry for 6 months. Nowhere near proven. Getting a song on Billboard 100 is not an accolade in today’s music 🤔 2 #meatballs

We see the White House every day on TV knowing that it was built by slaves. How would you feel if you were black? So when you corny rappers and people try to act/be black, don’t forget to be black mentally too 😎
I’d like like to see the same attention and energy that the Parkland massacre is getting, shift to these innocent black kids who are being massacred by police daily. Shooting them one by one doesn’t make it less important #imjustsaying

@IamAkademiks That’s been the new RIAA rule as long as the concert tickets absorbs the purchase of the album. Same thing with 1500 streams count for 1 download. It’s actually not a download but this is how these wack rappers been skating on the charts
I never saw DJ #akademiks spin a record. What part of the game is that?
Cops need training bad, 90% don’t know the law and most can’t even speak proper English. @NYPDnews
@Ritehero @IamAkademiks 5 songs on Billboard but NOT 5 hits. When the songs reaches top 10 then hmu. Dude is extremely delusional
