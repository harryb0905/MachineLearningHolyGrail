@pike_matthew @mitchellvii Criticizing I can agree. But can You agree that Mocking is not ok? Whether it’s a child or not.  Cant two people keep respect for one another, even in disagreement, without attacking each other personally? Making fun of someone or or their stance doesn’t help resolve issues. No?
@pike_matthew @mitchellvii We can agree to disagree Matt. See, I respect your opinion. I didn’t mock you.But I do disagree.I don’t think it’s ever ok to mock someone because you disagree with their beliefs. If he wants a healthy debate. Then debate his views. Calling him names and belittling him is wrong.
@pike_matthew @mitchellvii @davidhogg111 @FLOTUS Really? He’s not mocking him. Cmon dude. https://t.co/b7pc5Skdef
@mitchellvii You should be ashamed of yourself Sir. A grown man Attacking and Mocking children and claiming it to be “fun”? A child who watched his friends die in front him? Who has the courage to stand for something. How do you sleep at night? #appalled
@mitchellvii @davidhogg111 @FLOTUS -Can you start your Anti-Bullying Campaign by talking to @mitchellvii who thinks it’s ok to mock a person’s appearance because they don’t agree with them. Oh wait. Ure husband also does that. Can you talk to him too?
https://t.co/TcSmoLw0UQ   @RickSantorum This is an asinine statement. You want kids to learn CPR instead of using laws to  protect them in the first place? You're an idiot, sir.  And these "kids" will soon vote you out of job. How's that for being proactive?
@maccageezer Lost that dare.

@realDonaldTrump Doth protest too much, sir. If you are as innocent as you proclaim, no investigation can hurt you. You would think an investigation of an innocent man would make him happy. It would only clear his name.
Dear @realDonaldTrump, I’m not a strategist by any means. But I think your ratings might go up if you used @Snapchat to fire whoever’s next. Maybe a cool filter? Just a suggestion.

"A shutdown means the President is weak" — Donald Trump 2013
"I mean, problems start from the top (The President) and  have to get solved from the top and the president’s the leader. He’s got to get everybody in a room and he’s got to lead. They’re not going to be talking about who was the head of the House, the Senate"... DJT- circa 2013
Lemme get this straight. In 2013 Trump praises Republicans for gov't shutdown, and blames President. Now 2018- he blames Dems and says they shouldn't be tying it to DACA. But Replcns  tying shutdown in 2013 to Obamacare was a good thing?

@ASpacci yes.

@DGarofalo84 I i@agined what it would feel like if no one watched the show. Lol
@Snickerz831  that would be so cool. Life imitating art.

@TheWorldOfRSB @AnnaDeavereS @bettygilpin @stephenwallem @SHO_Jackie  Hey. YA got a half hour to kill before u put on #AmericanOdyssey NBC
@bettygilpin @stephenwallem uh... Yes. Of course I was. And it wasn't scripted either.
@stephenwallem damn it. Why didn't I do an accent. Wait... I'm on the west coast. What accent?
#NurseJackie premiers 2night @9pm on @SHO_Network  #AmericanOdyssey  is on 10pm tonight on @NBCOdyssey
Thanks for all the great questions. Keep hash tagging #NURSEJACKIE and #AMERICAN ODYSSEY and tune in tonight to spend Sunday nights w/ME!!!
@GaryABro @NBCOdyssey Awesome scripts, amazing directors, top notch actors, and solid characters...  #AmericanOdyssey
@Tammter @NBCOdyssey More important then the genre is the story for me. and the character. The genre is just the backdrop.
@lifesaverpeter @NBCOdyssey I'd like to have Peter Decker as friend. Always good to have a good lawyer as a friend. lol  #AmericanOdyssey
@Beccabearsc @NBCOdyssey That a tough one. So hard to pick.
@BordayoJ @NBCOdyssey Lol. No. I think those are in a trunk somewhere. Waiting for another Twilight movie.  #AmericanOdyssey
@Tiffanygrace013 Every role Ive taken has its degree of difficulty. If its too easy I usually pass on the role. lol
@twiregals @NBCOdyssey Modern Family.
@mskdlh @NBCOdyssey Sometimes ad-lib, but mostly on TV you don't improv. I have in film though. I did a whole move that was improved once.
@taniacfh @NBCOdyssey @JakeRobinsonAct JAKE IS AWESOME! Make sure you tune in to watch him tonight. He's so good.
@cadiannemorton @NBCOdyssey Indian Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean

@AsTheSnowFalls2 @NBCOdyssey @annafriel You'll have to keep watching to find out. ;)
@starbat6 @NBCOdyssey Patience... Dr. Carlisle Cullen #AmericanOdyssey
@mvnhattan @NBCOdyssey Coop. lol. Coop never had people threatening to kill him.. Except #NurseJackie
@twiregals @NBCOdyssey The actors  were working so intensely, Id have to say the hair and makeup team brought the levity behind the camera.
@jaureguignores @NBCOdyssey Thats a tough one.. Need help with this.. Imthrowing this one out to you guys... Any thoughts?
@ChristinaChapm7 @NBCOdyssey Being 1/3 of the story I get to enjoy the other 2/3 like the rest of the audience. :)
@twiregals @NBCOdyssey I would love to be able to fly... That would be awesome.
@WassUpEH @NBCOdyssey I think I like playing heroes better. Hard to root for a villain. But villains can be fun to play.
@BriannaRossR5 Yes... That was't fun :/  Luckily @WynterSarah was friends with a good plastic surgeon.
@thewildwolves @NBCOdyssey Peter Decker's world starts to unravel in tonights episode because he knows too much.
@sighzach @NBCOdyssey INTENSE, AMERICAN, THRILLER
@AsStrongAsALion Carlisle Cullen... For sure.
@VelvetStormFF @NBCOdyssey LOL. I rarely google myself. Its more fun googling other people. lol
@lisette225 @NBCOdyssey Cut my forehead in the scene where i get arrested in tonights ep. I caught it on the door getting into the back seat

Thanks for all the awesome questions guys. Hope you enjoy @nbcodyssey tonight. Gonna live tweet later. Now back to Easter Dinner. :)
@metheridge @NBCOdyssey Live tweeting at home with Melissa by my side. She wants me to bring out the deserts.
@GaryABro @NBCOdyssey @PeterDeckerEsq Yes. I know Anna trained with real soldiers.
@Rtreatwilliams @NBCOdyssey From your lips to God's ears... :) actually Im putting it in all future contracts.
@thatcullenchick @NBCOdyssey I think that would be so much fun. i love actors.
@VelvetStormFF @NBCOdyssey Im pretty used to it by now. Im my own worst critic so I can tell if what I intended to do worked or didn't
@JadelynS @NBCOdyssey I thought it was really well written, and i loved the conspiracy elects to it.
@GaryABro @NBCOdyssey No. Its completely fictitious events. Yet it explores themes going on in todays world.
@CarlisleSCullen @NBCOdyssey No. In the end our show is meant to entertain. Not preach.
@stewarob @NBCOdyssey Getting to have so many lives in one.I can b a Dr, a lawyer, a Vampire, a fireman etc all in one lifetime.And the fans
@MiRiAnP11 @NBCOdyssey Thats tough. Thats like asking me which one of my kids is my fave. lol I love them all for iff reasons.
@lifesaverpeter @NBCOdyssey Train. Study. Anyone can get a job as an actor.But few can have a career.A career takes a knowledge of the craft
@PFacinelliNews @NBCOdyssey My fave show is Ancient Aliens. Lol I like conspiracy shows. Maybe Peter Decker would like that show too.
@FacinelliLatino @NBCOdyssey As a fther he's torn between trying to get the truth out for the greater good, or protecting his fam. Tough.
@MiRiAnP11 @NBCOdyssey I felt emotionally beat up at times and the pressure he goes through made me tense even off camera. But  I had fun 2
@ANBrasel77 @NBCOdyssey Sometimes. Fear or nervousness is just another form of excitement without breath. So I just remind myself to breath.
@Oursexyreaser @NBCOdyssey The work is the same. The difference is in TV you get to explore that character longer.
@mskdlh @NBCOdyssey I miss the Twilight gang. Be fun to retime with some of them.
@kentuckywildros @NBCOdyssey I Think thats for the audiences to decide. Ive met diff fans that have connected to diff roles Ive played.
@sighzach @NBCOdyssey Took some time for me to find the character before we started filming. His voice, his rhythm, what drove him...
@OhMyCarlisle @NBCOdyssey He's not a super hero. He has no super powers. He's just a human being, but is driven to do some heroic things
@katydiva @NBCOdyssey Huge admiration for Anna Friel, Jake Robinson, and the rest of the cast and crew for working so hard on this show.
@krazylion2 @NBCOdyssey Thank you! :) Every character has its own challenge. So its challenging in diff ways.
@telepattinson @NBCOdyssey Tension, thrills,excitement, characters to root for, suspense...
@noelfshrs @NBCOdyssey When we prepped for Twilight we took Cat movement classes. So our characters moved cat like.
@SarahGodaire @NBCOdyssey I studies pre-law in College so that came in handy. And I watched a lot of documentaries to understand the world
@TonyTheTVGuy @NBCOdyssey @Maniella You'll have to tune in to see. :)
@tdlautnerr @NBCOdyssey Since I was in third grade. But I was very shy. So I never acted until college.
@Laurenk83 @NBCOdyssey YES!!!! Who wants to watch with me?
@lifesaverpeter @NBCOdyssey Its always like the first day of school. But then you grow together and become a family.
@mskdlh @NBCOdyssey I don't think any. But if you see something let me know.lol
@NanetteLopez1 @NBCOdyssey Im really excited. A lot of people worked really hard on this show. And I hope that people tune in to see it.
@PeterDeckerEsq @NBCOdyssey I hope so.:)
@NBCOdyssey The show asks a lot of questions, instead of giving answers. It shows how individuals can make a difference.
@NBCOdyssey When I was younger Paul Newman was my greatest inspiration and Robert Redford. Love those guys.
@awnbels @NBCOdyssey Sexy... lol
@NBCOdyssey I think his a fighter of truth. And very tenacious. That tenacity is his greatest character trait and greatest flaw.
@NBCOdyssey I try to do take diff roles on every job.I think Id get bored playing the same type all the time &amp; I like to surise the audience
@PeterDeckerEsq @NBCOdyssey Yes. So excited for them to see this character. Its diff then anything Ive played so far in my career.
@krazylion2 @NBCOdyssey I think theres a part of me in every character. But I like Dr Cooper's playfulness. I can be very goofy sometimes.
@cullenftswan @NBCOdyssey You mean juggle? I fly home every weekend to see them.
Thanks Mom... LOL https://t.co/2ZShuLvTK5
Whats up? Sorry was carving turkey. Let the questions begin.

@NBCOdyssey thanks to all the fans who submitted and thanks @NBCOdyssey for hosting. Hope to do another one next week before the show airs.
@NBCOdyssey truth, justice, and the American Way. ;)
@NBCOdyssey This character is very diff then any of my other roles. Looking forward to u seeing it.
@NBCOdyssey @somerhsario  Luca, Lola and Fiona. My three daughters. :)
@vikblythe @NBCOdyssey @AsTheSnowFalls2 it will be playing in the UK as well. On BBC I believe.
@NBCOdyssey @mskdlh my character goes through an intense emotional journey. Paranoia, guilt, fear, anger... At times it became exhausting.
@NBCOdyssey that's a tough one. We filmed three episodes at once. So it's hard to say. But the finale is definitely one that stands out.
@NBCOdyssey I get what it's like to have the pressures of being a father and balancing That with work. So I was able to bring that 2 role.
@NBCOdyssey @Going4Greatness by the way I read this quickly and thought you wrote live twerking each week. I may do that too. Lol.
@NBCOdyssey @Going4Greatness Hi Gabby! I'm sure we will take turns. Live tweeting and connecting with the fans is fun. :)
@NBCOdyssey I got 17 stitches in one scene. So I guess u could say yes. Lol. Although Anna Friel got beat up way worse physically.
@NBCOdyssey So excited. I'm incredibly proud of the show and the work on it. Not just my work but everyone involved. I "can't hardly wait".😉
@NBCOdyssey more on Horton- @zonker35 he really understands character and actors and the process. And k led how to get the best out actors.
@NBCOdyssey would love to direct someday.Can't let Peter Horton have all the fun. Lol.Honestly, he was so amazing to work with.Love that guy
@NBCOdyssey hmmm. If I could stay in Ent biz. I'd say writer/producer/ or director. If outside- lawyer. I like the courtroom drama elements
@NBCOdyssey intense, determined, family man, tenacious, honest. Also... Sexy. Lol;)
@NBCOdyssey wow. So many intense great moments. Too many to list. Don't want to spoil it for u. Hope u watch to see. :)
@NBCOdyssey my scenes were all filmed in NY. So I missed the filming in Morracco. Would have been cool to ride a camel. Lol.
@AdamArmus @NBCOdyssey Hahahhaha. I think if ur American. Like America. Been to America. Or heard of America. U will love #AmericanOdyssey
@NBCOdyssey it is a very different character from Coop on #NurseJackie. That was part of the fun for me, and the challenge.
@NBCOdyssey I liked the idea of a show exploring "does an individual have the power to change things". This show proves u do and u can.
@NBCOdyssey  He is a David going up against Goliaths with not much more than a sling shot.That takes a lot of tenacity &amp;courage
@lisette225 @NBCOdyssey I smacked my forehead on the edge of a car door on a scene where I was being arrested. 17 stitches  😳
@FacinelliLatino @NBCOdyssey no. I try to do roles I haven't done before. I like to surprise the audience with the new characters I play.
@HealthHarbinger @NBCOdyssey -all the above.
@NBCOdyssey - it's not based on true events.But it explores themes that are current. It's a show that asks questions but not answers.
@NBCOdyssey this show is visually stunning. Part of it filmed in Morracco and part in New York. The tension keeps u on edge.
@NBCOdyssey @SaadyaW I admire his courage. His tenacity to bring down corruption becomes his best and worst character trait.
@NBCOdyssey @Mrs_Tiffy lol.I studied pre-law for a year in college.I called my mom when I got the role and told her I was finally a lawyer.
@NBCOdyssey @thatcullenchick I went straight from #NurseJackie to #AmericanOdyssey in NOV. I finished mid March. So about 4 1/2 months.
@NBCOdyssey @lisette225 I was drawn to this shoe because I found the conspiracy thriller element exciting.
@NBCOdyssey @CarlisleSCullen  Peter Decker is a family man.I also am a family man. He fights for principles and truth. I can relate to that.
@NBCOdyssey -ready when u are @NBCOdyssey

@CharterCom @kamiRG worst... He's very self involved, and a bit socially inept. Best... He's childlike and never means any harm. #AskDrCoop
@CharterCom @JackieFach I was. I had a part in a school play and faked sick to get out of it.  Later I used acting to overcome my fear.
@CharterCom @FacinelliLatino  So many. Id have to say an upcoming episode where I have sex on a rooftop and get caught in a big way.😳
@CharterCom @franklymaria @summerluv28 @jessa7635  Cats Briefs Dramedy ;)
@CharterCom @IFellForTheLion well... U know the first time u hear your voice in a recording. It's about 100xs worse first time u see ureself
@CharterCom @sava_nnah it used to be Eve Best. But I'll have to go with @stephenwallem this past season. 😭
@CharterCom @JackieFach training is a very good idea. It gives u a foundation for a longer career. #AskDrCoop
@CharterCom is there a name for a breast doctor specialist? #AskDrCoop
@CharterCom @piebald46 I was on a plane once and someone got sick. They asked if there was a doctor onboard. I almost raised my hand. Lol
@CharterCom @lisette225 it's coming up this season. You'll know it when u see it. I get to sing a bit. ;)
@CharterCom @IFellForTheLion hmmm.... I hate to say yes. But in some ways. I can be very goofy at times. #AskDrCoop

Spent the day planting trees with my folks. Oranges, lemons, grapefruits. They were right. More fun than the beach. And more fruitful.Punny?
Was gonna take my parents to the beach to enjoy the LA sun. But they wanted to Home Depot to buy plants. Um. Ok. That too is also fun.

@KristenVath @Em_Tease @camillleann @KBUNZZizBACK @k8_beier good luck with your lacrosse games.
It's over. First Super Bowl win for the SeaHawks. 👍43-8. Great game for Seahawks. Their defense was unstoppable.
They are bringing out the trophy already.
@_Neilchen_ never say never. Although very unlikely. -For the Broncos. Not for your tweet. :)
Great catch. Broncos on the scoreboard.
I think they should let our @directtv Celebrity Beach Bowl team come In as a Special team 2 help the Broncos out after the commercial break
Third turnover of the game. Ouch.
I'm rooting for the #Seahawks but this is a tough game to watch. When's the Super Bowl gonna start. C'mon Broncos get on the scoreboard.
