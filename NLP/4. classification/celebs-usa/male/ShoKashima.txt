@JamesScottIIX wanna kick it like Kareem Hunt?
@JamesScottIIX Who are you spitting fire at? It‚Äôs fantastic line
@TheBradOwen Nice! Are you going to be playing at P-mill all week?
Large! https://t.co/0V3v3XwIAr

First trip to Korea! Annyeoung haseyo!
Sick! Love the inclusion of moguls on @ESPNStreak  We shall see what happens tonight https://t.co/99zy5VJnWe
@kcraFitz I will be. Leaving on Tuesday to catch the SBX
@kcraFitz Hey Deirdre! Awesome guy, right? That would be my best friend and also, I became his agent a few months ago
Cool. But what about funding our athletes? https://t.co/YGq00LgoA0
Last day before Rule 40 restriction.  Athletes, don‚Äôt forget 2 thank your sponsors today. Because when you medal in #peyongchang, you won‚Äôt be able to. Most brands, other than a select few you‚Äôll see advertising during the Olympics, will pretend like the Olympics aren‚Äôt happening
@marshmellomusic @HOBBoston Any chance we can include this as a stop on @TeamCheever ‚Äòs gold medal tour?
@TonyWeisman I'm representing Boston native @teamcheever, who was named to the 2018 Olympic Team this week. Loves @dunkindonuts. Any chance we can connect? https://t.co/aL1pGg7nZq
@TheCraneCouple nice to meet you guys today. Hope Vegas treated you well
Seems like a lack of planning by @korail1899 will make Olympic transportation a complete mess. Hopefully they get it together within the next few weeks
@JamesScottIIX @maccerceo I thought that was obvious
@JamesScottIIX @maccerceo A rolly, 2 pots and 3 scales. Can get about a 50 and a hummer

Dodgers blew a 3-3 tie!

@Winesd Challenger R/T. 6 speed manual and will probably get studs
Yup. Did it. Goodbye Audi AWD. Hello pure American muscle RWD
Closed on my house August 5, 2016. Maybe today will be the day I buy a new car?
@Winesd Meth is a hell of a drug
No more Audi... Which one should be next?
Camaro SS, Challenger R/T, or Mustang GT?? Infiniti G37 may sneak in there too...

@jhenitiuk Yes sir! Looking forward to catching up!!
Just turned in my final college assignment, kept my 4.0! On to the next project tomorrow... going skiing for 2 weeks in Canada
@petesonntag congratulations! When do you start up there? I'm heading up soon, would love to catch up if you're in town
@ESPNStreak This is very millennial of me/unsolicited feedback, but an extra scroll and button click every time for the same functionality as old app...
@ESPNStreak What happened to listing picks chronologically? Trying to go Instagram style by "suggesting" hot picks?
Is "Instagram model" a real job now?
I ate a banana in one bite today!

@ArianFoster how can I get a Feeno hat from you?
@JamesScottIIX #triviatuesday this is how fast James VIII finished the gallon milk challenge. Bonus- how many ribs did he eat after?
@JamesScottIIX need a new one. When we spot a solo going down start singing "ARE YOU LONELY ARE YOU LONELY ARE YOU LONELY üéµüé∂"
@JamesScottIIX I forget. Might have been nage or Luke. What was said before the infamous "HUHHHUHHUHUH" nage laugh?

@JamesScottIIX I'm gonna $0.00 this one. I think it's noodles and cream soda. But other fools like nage got corndogs n shit
Bought a cap/gown, applied for awards, and even picked a location to attend a ceremony. I'll be graduating Summa Cum Laude!

Passed 3 Google certifications this week, working on a 4th. Feeling like a "Revenge of the Nerds" type transformation
Dab every time you sneeze so you look extra cool when you spray saliva and old food bits everywhere. It's 2017
Boomerang, proving that things are just as boring backwards. Chicks love it though
Well, this is required for my digital marketing class. Something completely different than usual.  https://t.co/z3L6h7p4Dx
Brutal start to my last semester, we start classes tomorrow. But, it is the LAST semester, can't wait!
@mikebahn I might be dumb but I can suppress it when I need to! Happy holidays sir
Project PS4.0 - got a PS4 for Xmas. Can't let it ruin my life and 4.0 GPA. Or gain more than 4.0 lbs.
Just got registered for my last classes! Can't wait to graduate as a 13th year senior. Now, which DeVry ceremony to attend?
Born early enough in November to just be eligible to vote beginning in 2004. Name all 4 candidates I've voted for and you win.
Turning 30 in a few days. Time to start drinking Diet Coke
Winterizing the sprinklers and doing the last fall fertilizer cycle before winter. What a change from Octobers of the last ten years
@ESPNStreak @itsmikemags am I banned? I submitted my answer for the shirt same time as Pete. Name:notsponsored3043 https://t.co/1rLV4yRM4F
Are you allowed to say the words Steve Bartman this time of year?
@taurabella better than a child
Now the tough decision, which @devryuniv graduation ceremony to attend...
This might be way out there, but maybe we're being used as an experiment on the power of media/social media during this election...
Took my job a year ago. Crazy. Certain tasks that were routine are now luxury: trips to Park City, gym time, getting the heart rate above 75
Midterms week. Just 36 more weeks til graduation!
Last year, it was gym and water ramp everyday. This year, I'm mowing the lawn, preparing for my housewarming party. EVERYONE IS INVITED
@ESPNStreak my buddy and I have a side prop... It's currently 104 to 102 wins. Any chance you can throw in some extra props tomorrow?
Got enough points with finals week ahead to guarantee an A in my last summer class. 4.0 going into senior year, 5 days til the first day!
Thank you @Solzilla for getting me through this damn day. #onrepeat
@JeremyBloom11 good call
@Driftingfreddy the two chicks in pink are cute
Watched 0 minutes of the Olympics so far, but about 20 hours on this IOC #Rule40 paper. Where does Olympic ad $ go? Not to the athletes

People are addicted to looking busy- confusing activity with productivity. What are you really getting done? Spend major time on major items
Dab aka fake sneeze
1 ski day, 1 missed day due to avalanche concerns (in June), and now back to SLC for work. Be back in Whistler aka Australia in a week.

Going to my 2nd career wedding this weekend and putting in an offer on a house. It's like I'm turning into a real adult.
Open houses and home tours with an agent all weekend. Super excited to move along the buying process!
@Driftingfreddy only if your friend goes bare bunz underneath
Head is spinning! New career, classes, ski camp, and now buying a home. Find out a lot about my productivity. What are brakes? #gaspedal
Life is nuts. Completely crazy. But being able to find peace and balance is beautiful. It becomes easier and easier
Don't be fooled. We didn't share very well #gameboy  @yamatokashima https://t.co/A9TmAOk2S1
Best way to advertise a yard sale?
What is Cinco de Mayo? What is _______?
Still holding the 4.0 with 1 year left to go. Is it like cheating if you're going to be a 29 year old senior?
Feel like I've matured 10 years this week. Time to come home. See you tomorrow, USA
Slept til 5am first night in Japan. Chalk that up as a W. Not a pretty one, maybe an OT win after hacking the worst free throw shooter
Off to Japan today. Language barrier to the next level. My face invites a convo in Japanese. Can't even speak it at an elementary level
Survival. #finalsweek #allstarweek
Could have been in bed by 10:30. Instead chose to hit the gym til midnight. Paying the price this am. Gonna be a rough one #carnap
Work myself into the ground to forget what's real. Better than substance abuse. Rough day
And I'd say death bothers me less than most, but today has been a struggle to stay focused. Always tough to lose blood you share
Usually I'm good about being aware that time doesn't sympathize with you or slow down for you because you're in a tough situation...
@JamesScottIIX going to Tahoe. I know you got the house. Save up for a car now! That's my 6 mo. plan too. House then car
@JamesScottIIX mini retirement/house warming party this weekend? Going to Tahoe today thru Sunday
@CaseyAndringa6 bring the party! Don't invite your pud friends like @Eli_Langston4
Retired exactly 6 months ago. Still haven't had a proper retirement party. Now that I can afford it, maybe it's time?
Can you keep up with me on skis? Enter the Gunbarrel 25 at @skiheavenly on 4/2 and see if you can! Ps- I'm healthy!  https://t.co/7k5THbgK3b
@Driftingfreddy When are you gonna ask me to prom?
@mike_bing and none of them are flexing... What have you done?!
#mondays aren't so bad when you go to bed at 7:30pm on Sunday. It also makes me a #loser
@Eli_Langston4 2- Hungarian rules. Full contact within the tee box
@Eli_Langston4 1- you wouldn't get it. You don't swung hard enough to start a light breeze
Mogul skiing, trampoline, hockey, and golf filled weekend. And now I remember why I'm retired #ouch #joints #earlykneereplacement
I hope Grayson Allen keeps shooting free throws so we can keep looking at his awesome hickey #DukeVsUNCW
@Driftingfreddy I'll fart in your milk and you'll work at Applebee's this summer and your boss's name will be a man named Courtney
@Driftingfreddy coming to steal your leftover cheese pipes during lunch...
Start of the tourney, #StPatricksDay , stunt day, and diarrhea. Could be the least productive day of work and homework of all time.

Sack via sack tap. Awesome because it was challenged and we get to see a lot of slow mo replays
Donkey move. Eat a chipotle burrito in 5 mins, straight to intense workout. Pre #SB50 vomit
Been having abstract thoughts on love. What is it? It's not measurable. How do you know you've experienced it. I don't think I know
@caitlinfurin I've never taken a selfie nor have touched a selfie stick (other than to break them)
I'll be in the crowd at the Deer Valley World Cup tomorrow, and I'll promptly snap any selfie sticks in half.
I got new colors. Or no colors.  #IR #town https://t.co/sscqe4DfFk
This season, I've gone skiing 9 days. Between fall and spring semesters, I'm taking 30 credits. School wins.
@ESPNStreak what's the average win pct this month? Board seems easier and I feel like I'm smashing, but wondering if I'm just a donkey
#NationalHugDay is 4 the (Fri)end zone. Do yourself a favor- get in the end zone, spike the ball, and get flagged for excessive celebration

Xmas eve travel day. Enjoying the donkey show. Saw a dude puking in a garbage can at the security checkpoint #slc #donk #retiredmedallion
Watching Star Wars as a kid, I didn't realize this, but watching now- these guys have some Maury type family stuff going on
Watching the Selections live feed... at work, on my lunch break. Mild to moderate itch to ski currently. But the knees are thanking me
Finished my finals a week early. Lots of gym time and planning parties for the coolest sorority at DeVry. #sororitylife
Paid for a lift ticket today. First time in 12 years? #ouch #gotexans
@MikaelKingsbury Congrats on your new record! So dominant. Hope to see you soon

@TheRealSimonCho Thanks Simon. Are you still in SLC? I actually got a job down here and moved to the valley

I think this will be the first time since mid-2013 that I'll be in Tahoe and actually walking. Crutches have been a common theme

This year, I give in. I'll fit the stereotype. Any guesses on my costume?
Being Asian, #halloween is tough for me. You're limited to 3-4 costume options. I usually try to break out, but no one knows what I am
@JamesScottIIX Vegetables are for pussies and farmers. Salsa is the closest thing you need.
Trying out new gyms. This is tough being a gym snob. Very unimpressed. Anyone got gym recommendations in slc?
#finalsweek during #allstarweek ?! Stealing a minute or 2 or 90 in the gym. At least I don't have a wife... Or a kid
@AUKathleen2418 No way! I needed furniture for my new place. It barely fit in the Audi though...
