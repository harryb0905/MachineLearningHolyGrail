But overall I think 2019 will be a great but rough year for creators as we begin to see the website change even more rapidly than before. I’m just excited to see what happens 💙
And I’m really happy that my all time favorites creators are still making awesome content like @PhillyD , @meghantonjes , @CaseyNeistat , @garyvee, @shaycarl , @Jenna_Marbles , @shanedawson etc
Also I’m super excited to be watching new creators that I didn’t know a few years ago like @DavidDobrik , @funforlouis , @saradietschy, @TheValleyfolk , @emmachamberlain ...
As far as YouTube Rewind 2018 it wasn’t great but a lot of people worked hard on it. Even so, it missed the mark. Next year if they do a Rewind (which I think they should), they need to have a YouTuber(s) create/produce/edit it

@garyvee It’ll be interesting to see how “Backpack” kid and all the other artists take on the suit. Should be interesting in that economic market space and it’s internal reaction to the responses
I’d love to know what @garyvee thinks of the fornite law suits and how culture can be monetized and how we should respond?
All the dancers/artists that had their image/dance moves used by the @FortniteGame should band together, demand payment  and sue for continued royalties for any in-game purchases. It’s a new form of piracy and we can be better then we were with music and movies.
Hip-hop isn’t changing the culture...Hip-hop IS the culture. Embrace the gifts and the knowledge learned from this incredibly concept and art form. It come with its own philosophies that are constantly evolving and I love it 💙

Everyone was tweeting their Spotify numbers &amp; I did too. It also sorta felt like a big ego measurement that I fell victim to. Everyone has these crazy numbers &amp; I felt a sense of insecurity that I’m not where I’m supposed to be. But then I said f*ck it &amp; made it a goal in 2019.

@JohnTJohnson2 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The fact you think fighting makes you more of a man is laughable. You use the term MSM which already speaks volumes of your intellectual ability to think for yourself. Truly, hope you find happiness and maybe gain some perspective. 👋🏻

I think @jakepaul has an opportunity to be his more authentic true self on camera. He could set himself apart from his toxic family members and find a super successful lane of his own. After the @shanedawson piece I feel like Jake is capable of so much more. I hope he does 🙏🏻
Also @shanedawson deserves a LONG VACATION...BUT if he doesn’t make a follow-up mini series on @JustinRoberts44 then I’ll be super sad...Maybe a Christmas special? https://t.co/AtWBIMap6l

Donald Trump calling @KingJames “stupid” is straight up racism. Our president is a cowardly idiot who is a disgusting example of America. https://t.co/bBBdnHJanp

@ryanbutland @CaseyNeistat Totally. I guess time will tell
Thoughts on the Logan Paul interview: he is seemingly semi self-aware but I think it’s all for the cameras. I just think he doesn’t have perspective when it comes to life on and off camera. But good for @CaseyNeistat for his honesty 🙏🏻
@SweeTARTSCandy Sadly they don’t have them online or near me? If ya’ll Send me some then I’ll write y’all a song! 🤣😆🤩

What is the weirdest thing you have asked your Amazon Alexa?

Has anyone thought of putting crunchy Cheetos on pizza? 🍕🍕🍕
Instagram should introduce a feature where we can see who has zoomed in on your photo...THAT would be a true tell of whose staking ya! 🤷🏻‍♂️💁🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

It feels like the @HuttonHotel is my new home is Nashville 🙏🏻

Staying up all night &amp; listening to Drake’s #Scorpion ...How bout you?
I disagree on 99% of what @TedNugent stands for politically but his appearance on @joerogans podcast today made me highly respect him and his opinion. It was so nice to hear a honest debate on various issues. 🙏🏻 #GodBlessTheUSA
Don't hate me, but I haven't watched one match of the #WorldCup

Anyone want to overnight ship me an In-N-Out burger from LA? cool...thanks in advance....
I embrace all religions regardless of my own beliefs because that is what being an AMERICAN is truly about. We created a country to free ourselves from scrutiny of who and why we worship. To all people of Muslim faith I stand with you. ❤️

Posted 2 videos to my IGTV on @instagram ... going all in just like @garyvee told me to! 👊🏻
@Thelocklady17 @mike_Zollo Aw you sound a little snowflakey too...
@mike_Zollo you sound like a snowflake 😂
@laurieCR13 That's even worse...😠 She is just as bad as the orange clown she is married to
Did no one tell her this would be a bad idea? How dumb is she or the people she surrounds herself with? Shame on you Melania Trump for being completely oblivious and stupid... https://t.co/SulUgRvaTw
@realDonaldTrump No we don’t you dumb orange ass clown. We want appropriate and humane borders with security and integrity. https://t.co/X2hbni5xSs
The world is kinda messed up right now.... But this video made me smile because although these two beautiful souls are gone , I know they’re not alone and are tickling each other in heaven. #RipKoko https://t.co/LMIzhN1sjL
RIP Koko... This little gif below is from a larger video she made with my favorite actor Robin Williams. She watched all his movies and wanted to tickle fight with him when he visited her. Truly a beautiful moment. 🖤 https://t.co/yeto8k0Gi8
I’m going “ALL IN” @garyvee style on the new @instagram IGTV ... Mark my words. The hustle and the hunger is REAL!
Illegally crossing the border is only a misdemeanor… Which means that it’s on the same level as jaywalking. Let that sink in...Imagine being taken from your family for something so silly. I don’t want OPEN borders, I want OPEN minds!
So @RHYMEFEST’s BRAND NEW will always be my jam. So ahead of its time....”Excuse me I’m wack-tose intolerant...”
How quickly we forget...
@nikkebirde It’s common sense. This is America ✌🏻
@nikkebirde Yea it is the governments job. And the current president could fix this, but he won’t because he’s not capable nor has he surrounded himself with people well versed and/or studied in these departments of immigration currently
@nikkebirde There already are family detention centers.They would need to be properly processed &amp; vetted.Treat each case individually &amp; see if they’re seeking asylum. It’s simple compassion.The attempt to remedy this is the humane thing to do. You seem to prefer the alternative which is sad
@nikkebirde It’s easy. You can detain them as families and treat them with dignity and not as cattle. You then can process them within hours together in a competent system and deal with with accordingly
If my mom was separated from me when I was just a child she would’ve been destroyed. I would’ve been destroyed. It would’ve ruined my life. We can do so much better than this. We can have a secure border but we don’t need to treat children/families this way
“No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble...Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you...Picture me inside the misery of poverty...No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived…” 🙏🏻
Happy #FathersDay to all the fathers out there and the father figures that make our lives better
There’s nothing better than seeing @garyvee out and about with his family showing us all that WORK and LIFE balance is real. If GARY can do it then we can do it! #VaynerNation
Has anyone ever shipped themselves an In-N-Out burger from LA to NYC and then ate it upon it arriving? Cuz I wanna try it.
Sarah Sanders is pure trash...That’s not me hating...It’s me stating facts

You’ve never been a burden on my mind or on my heart. Accepting and loving yourself is the hardest part. So even when we’re in the darkest of the night, It only takes a spark of a match for you to see the light. ❤️
Change is the only constant...Embracing it and learning to roll with the punches. Thanks @garyvee for always giving insight and providing VALUE! https://t.co/ILpDr9af8W
When it comes to vocals,visuals,artistry and overall talent I still in awe of @JessieJ ... Her voice is a treasure and I just adore her

If Roseanne gets her TV show canceled after one racist tweet, then can we cancel Donald Trump as president after his account list racist tweets, remarks and actions?

I feel like we are living in a Black Mirror episode....Which is the most black mirror thing to say....
“Tell 'em you love 'em while they're here.....Tell 'em you love 'em while you're here.” -@Lin_Manuel 🙏🏻
So bye bye Roseanne ✌️....Not that I watched your show because I have better things to do with my time then see you try to be relevant again.
I’m surprised someone hasn’t done a “This is YOUTUBE” parody showing the bullish!t the creators and viewers have to deal with? (And NO this isn’t a video to minimize or trivialize the original piece video by Childish Gambino) #ThisisAmerica #ThisisYoutube
An ex-girlfriend of mine was once on the Bachelor. So I feel like that means it’s ok for me to go on #thebachelorette right?

Every time I hear about another school shooting I get terribly sad and angry. We have had so many of these young lives lost and we haven’t done anything to try to stop it. We need to listen to each other and make a CHANGE!
Looks like @ShawnMendes is crushing it and I’m very happy about that. It’s great to see people achieve their dreams. It serves as inspiration ... 🙏🏻

So #SoloAStarWarsStory isn’t even OUT yet but I already want a Star Wars stand-alone #Lando movie with @donaldglover
The new #BohemianRhapsody trailer for the movie about Freddie Mercury and QUEEN looks SO DAMN GOOD! Can’t wait for November!
Love should be unconditional. Anything else is just an excuse....Life is better with love. Hold on to it. Treasure it.
So @charlieputh’s “The Way I Am” is a banger to start off the #Voicenotes album! Love it! 🔥🔥🔥
Do yourself a favor and learn to be emotionally bulletproof....

Boy Scouts want some of that girl scouts cookies money... 😆😆😆
Also being Kanye West sounds like a choice to me... SMH

Dear @HarleyPlays I need some #PizzaInABag in NYC!!
I need to share this new music I’ve been making!! Tweet me where I should tour in Europe &amp; the United States so I can choose some spots to play! ⚡️🖤
Only #Kanye could make me both love and hate him...But I guess that is what a true artist is...Polarizing. 🙏🏻 (But I ain’t down with the Trump bullish!t)
Loving the #InMyBloodVideo ... it’s got a great simple emotional vibe and it’s awesome
Hey there @OpenTable ... I booked a reservation and I believe your app glitched and booked me at the wrong amount of people and now I can’t modify the reservation. Please help make this right.
What if I did a house party tour in Europe? I wanna come and try it in London and see how it works....Whoever hosts the party will get VIP access/Merch and it’ll be a cool living room vibe!
If you live in London and have a house I can play I’d happily come and do a few songs. Invite all the fans over and have a personal intimate shows for y’all to hear my new music! Hit me up 🙏🏻
So confused by #Westworld and I’m very happy about that.
I want to do a tour of Europe… Even if it’s playing in your living room. First stop should be London! If you were anyone you know works at a bar club or venue that would be willing to let me play then you will get free tickets and free Merch!
You’re only as strong as your principles...Stay true to who and what you are abt to achieve.
Wow. Saddens and shocked by the death of @Avicii ... What an increidbkely talented young soul.
I'm here for this new KANYE album...🔥🔥🔥
I love New York... but the #NYPD traffic cops are some of the meanest,rudest and unprofessional people on the streets. It’s a shame because they could be doing a better job AND be nice to their fellow New Yorkers. Shame 😕
So looks like I need to start watching the @WWE because it looks awesome and I feel like I’ve been missing out

@united @united  I just DM’ed you guys ... please make this right.
@united you should take care of your customers especially in these days. You guys just essentially STOLE $100 from me for 2.7 pounds. Absolutely ridiculous
@united @united No. And even if I did, you should take care of your customers especially in these days. You guys just essentially stole $100 from me.
@united your baggage policy is ridiculous. I’m being charged $100 for being 2.7 pound socer your “limit”. I don’t have a 2nd bag to put that 2.7 pounds in and you essentially robbed me of that money. How can you fix this?
@realchocolate25 New stuff coming very very soon 😝🤫
@JasonnarT Is that a good or a bad “girl”. Please decode and translate for me haha I’m not nearly cool enough to understand hahaha🤣🤣
You’re truly free when you realize that WHAT YOU ARE isn’t always WHO YOU ARE

Currently watching the “This Is Me” scene from #TheGreatestShowman over and over cuz it’s so dope
Dear @garyvee ... I would happily produce the mixtape if you’d let me legally rip your audiobook and make music for the best parts. The world needs the Gary Vee Mixtape
Now listening to #CrushingIt and I need @garyvee to take the best parts and have beats put under them and release a mixtape. It’d be a great album/project
368 is gonna be epic. Can’t wait to see the journey. Who knows, maybe even be a part of it. Congrats @CaseyNeistat!
There will be times when I won't be able to hold your hand...But you can be sure, I'll always be there to hold your heart...
I hope everyone at the YouTube HQ is safe. This news is terrible to hear...I just wish this wasn’t happening anymore
Now listening to @JohnMayer’s “Emoji Of A Wave” and it’s so brilliantly written...It makes me feel like I’m crusing down the coastline of California...
Who inspires you to be better?

So @garyvee , does the $1.80 strategy work within the new Instagram algorithm? Been hustling and still doing it regardless but would love to know your thoughts?
Relish in the beauty of life and don’t ever miss out on something because you tricked yourself into believing you couldn’t do it alone...

@IvankaTrump I’m sure your “prayers” really help stop bullets from stealing those kids lives. You &amp; your family continues to show the worst America has to offer. Denounce your father and divorce your sad excuse for a husband. Thanks.

What if kids/teens decide to just not go to school until these gun laws were fixed...Every single day just walk out...sit outside your classroom...keep sharing your stories...and your teachers should do the same...
Dear Marco Rubio... take this L tonight ... You seem to have some form of intelligence &amp; I hope for your children's future that you reconsider your view on guns...If it was your kid who was killed then you'd feel differently...
Teachers already have an incredibly difficult and underpaid occupation...They don't need to now sustain the responsibility to have a firearm in the classroom.
TEACHERS SHOULD NOT CARRY GUNS....Ban the assault rifles and stop with the thoughts and prayers. Your 2nd amendment right is NOT more important than my inalienable right to LIFE.....
I had too much to think last night...🙃

Is it legal to tell an elected official or public person to “Go Fu*k themselves”...?
@TomiLahren FYI aren’t you desecrating the flag here? Any answer from ms.snowflake?
@RyanAFournier @TomiLahren Yes.
@TomiLahren Why don’t you say that in the mirror to yourself. Maybe you’d learn how dumb you truly are...
@TomiLahren No it’s not. You’re a brainwashed &amp; ignorantly person who lack empathy. When you have a kid I hope it is never killed in a school shooting

I’m very excited for #SoloAStarWarsStory but I really want a #ChewieAStarWarsStory
@HarleyPlays Will we EVER see Willie subtitles or see more Chewie backstory in the upcoming #SoloAStarWarsStory film? Or do we hope for a CHEWIE stand-alone movie?
I figured I’d ask my Star Wars guru @HarleyPlays ... How old is chewie? Like he’s stayed the same throughout all the films and I wanna see a teenage Chewbacca trying to pick up some lady wookies...
I wish I was having as much fun as @bellathorne is. She’s my new favorite thing ever.
Sitting here watching the #SpaceX spaceman live feed on my TV with Bowie on repeat... thank you @elonmusk

Loving this #SpaceX launch! So much fun to focus on something like this instead of our dorito faced president...

@garyvee I figured you would! 👊🏻 ... https://t.co/mWlOP0H0zX
So @garyvee how do you feel about people flipping your shoes or Merch? Disrespectful or part of the hustle &amp; grind? Would love to know!
I have a feeling @Apple will release a new "iPhone" but it won't be numbered. They'll start naming them to avoid having to call something the iPhone12, 13, 14, 15 etc... #iPhoneX #Apple
In life and in business ya gotta stand your ground,but know when to let things go...knowing the difference is the true gift.

Doubled up on #CrushingIt ... Can’t wait to dive in @garyvee https://t.co/u9TAcqjM14
Is it just me? Or did Instagram change it’s algorithm?
I’m thinking Michael Jackson still had the best Super Bowl halftime show...Maybe Prince after that. Then the queen BEYONCÉ and Gaga
So @garyvee who are your picks tonight for The Grammys? ... AND Do you think that CRUSHING IT next year can be nominated for Best Spoken Word Album/Audiobook?
Excited for #TheGrammys ... more excited for the memes that are created from the show...Will there be drama?!?
Saturdays in the city. #nyc https://t.co/IJ7UDmhEdU
I’m excited to see what brands do something different for the upcoming #SuperBowl as far as promo/commercials ... I’m guessing some twitter/Instagram story-telling and surprises
I would love to know what @garyvee thinks of the XFL ... Do you think it will work/attract talent?
Hey @garyvee , great meeting you today! It was my pleasure and now I’m inspired to crush it even more! #CrushingIt
Manifest and work towards what you want. Visualize it. Eat it. Sleep it. Breathe it.
I want a girl who eats french fries in the nightclub
Super excited to see @SaraBareilles &amp; Jason Mraz in @WaitressMusical! Sara, let me know if you want someone to bring a bottle of champagne or whiskey backstage! 👌🏻 Can’t wait to see the show!!
I call all dogs and children under five chicken nuggets… It’s my term of endearment.
Not to beat a dead horse, but I just wish @LoganPaul would have made a point in his video to actually say SORRY without slow-motion, or sad/sappy music. He also needs to let his fans know that their behavior is not acceptable either. Time will tell i guess...

I think @TryCaviar is the new and better Postmates.... (notice I didn’t @ them haha) 🤣🤣🤣
So @garyvee I’m thinking you should start a #CurrentlyCrushingIt hashtag to show pics of all the people reading your new book! Then the best pics get retweeted &amp; maybe a giveaway! #HustleModeON
@garyvee Well then I’m glad I’ve already got some @garyvee vintage Merch!
Where is all the @garyvee Merch?!? What happened to the Merch store?!? I need me some #HustleMode gear!
In a few years thanks to @DJIGlobal  drones have stopped being just for major motion pictures or toys...They’ve managed to create an amazing new camera and a way to capture photos and videos like NEVER before! #DJIMavicAir

@KatKiros You're missing the context of the saying "The Future is Female" in that we have no future if we don't embrace women as complete equals because without them there would be no men... #EqualityForAll Sorry if you misunderstood! ❤️

What if your wildest dreams came true...? Then what do you do?

@Delta I hit that link and have messaged you multiple times...still no email of confirmation for my credit
@Delta still waiting for my confirmation email and a response from you?
@Delta I’ve tweeted multiple times and Direct messages you AND spent an hour on you customer service line...and no one has answered ... this is ridiculous.
@Delta still waiting for confirmation  email of my credit? It’s been almost 45 minutes. For an email?!?
@Delta @DeltaAssist @Delta I’ve been waiting for a confirmation email of my credit for my flight ... This was AFTER an hour on the phone with your customer support... This has been a terrible customer experience
@Delta @DeltaAssist I’ve been waiting for a confirmation email of my credit for my flight ... This was AFTER an hour on the phone with your customer support... This has been a terrible customer experience
@Delta , it’d be nice if you actually helped your customers and cared if they return as loyal customers instead of putting then on hold with no answers, or credit/refund?!? Shame on you guys

@FiveRights The movie won’t fail. You will. And so will your ideology based on stupidity. Can’t wait til you age out of existence so this country can finally progress towards kindness and equality. Until then, please leave... #ThePost
Seriously @netflix please give @TommyWiseau a series! And please call it “Oh Hi Mark...”
@mgoodwin_nypost Your articles forget to mention any of the ridiculous Trump tweets. You’re incredibly one-sided and frankly borderline Trump propaganda. Do us all a favor and go away. Thanks! 👌🏻
Also I think the #GoldenGlobes have become the best award show over the oscars...Way more real and less hype
Netflix should give Tommy Wiseau a show/documentary movie and call it... "Oh, Hi Mark..." #GoldenGlobes #TheDisasterArtist
@h_posner It had been on sale for a while, and I find it bad practice to turn away a customer...And not honor the price stated less than 12 hours prior
@h_posner I had stuff in my cart Saturday night and was paying cash and thus couldn’t order online. I went into the store today &amp; they said the offer had expired &amp; wouldn’t honor it. I left without purchasing since they wouldn’t match their prices from less than 12 hours earlier
@Reggie_SoDope I’m a white boy from NYC and even I agree 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻

So the trash that is @Erictrump blocked me...but I can still tweet about him and how horrible of person his father is...
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Dude , No one likes you’d, or cares about what you have to say...Stick to being the worst trump child &amp; killing engendered animals to compensate for your lack of any form of manhood
Need to get home so I can binge watch the new #BlackMirror4 series on Netflix! WHO ELSE IS WATCHING?
@realDonaldTrump Ok...You’re an absolute idiot...
Here comes the...”New Year, New Me” memes https://t.co/sxTOnMJLBh
@EricTrump No one wants to drink that horse piss you call wine. Just stop.
@EricTrump I guess it sucks when everyone despises you, your father and your entire family...👌🏻
Why isn’t there a series where famous people stream live and watch movies with the fans? Making commentary like a gamer but just hanging out...Could be the future of content... aka “Movie Night with (insert celebrity here)”...
The internet is the new musical instrument...learn to play it...
To anyone complaining about Star Wars: It is a movie about space wizards with laser swords!!! After The Force Awakens everyone complained it was the same old film … Now we get something different in The Last Jedi and everyone still isn’t happy
@ejdickson Truth
We’re almost there… On all levels &amp; on all fronts…Once something happens to you/someoneyou love, once you are affected personally, that’s when your perspective changes. “insert issue” Doesn’t matter, until it happens to you...
It’s crazy to think that some American girl dolls are living more luxurious lives than some humans…

@stevezaragoza honk you very much...
@stevezaragoza We need a Steven Z’s leel review of #TheLastJedi in YouTube ASAP

@ChelsieHadden hopefully the rest of the country (and world) wakes up and does what WA has done.
@ChelsieHadden Exactly. People need to educate themselves and not think of it as reefer madness. It’s (almost) 2018. Simple google search shows it’s monumental benefits for health (and economy)
I find it ridiculous that medical marijuana isn’t readily available for those who are in such terrible pain due to cancer and other illnesses. We need to change these laws because until it’s your friend,mom/dad or brother/sister you don’t know how it feels...🙏🏻
2 hours...Get ready... https://t.co/SmA4Bh360n
Are you ready for tomorrow...? #SaveMe https://t.co/PK0qo2yI4N
Don’t think twice , it’s alright... https://t.co/jMI8Ljdanp
Why has no one told me about @YesJulz before?!?! She fine and a boss lady! #MarryMe
You’re a joke I refuse to laugh at...
I miss what we used to be
Can you separate the art from artist...or once the person is tainited is all their work then tainted? When you’re heroes reveal themselves to be villains is their work all for nothing?
@UPLIFTDesk Any chance ya’ll can let me know if my order shipped? Never got a shipping confirmation?
So @garyvee now that Instagram has changed its top 9 format , how do you see the $1.80 strategy evolving and changing?
Don’t let anyone tell you that your dreams aren’t real or worthy. Even if they claim to love you they will never have the vision. Prove them wrong and forget their opinion.
Much LOVE to @garyvee for this video today... it provided me VALUE but more importantly it gave me PERSPECTIVE...  https://t.co/rmgr9Bk6mW #GaryVaynerchuk

Why isn’t there a pop-up shop in NYC that sells #ButterBeer?
Shout out to my mate @CodySimpson and his new wavy project. This tune is a smash! https://t.co/04lvTR20w0 Congrats Bruh! 🏄🏼‍♂️🏄🏼‍♂️🏄🏼‍♂️

My thoughts on #Alabama and #DougJones and #RoyMoore ... Watch til the end to really understand my view https://t.co/qXNToGM9Ol
@Everlane Just DM'ed ya back! :)
My #WednesdayWisdom is related to losing. Learn to love your L’s and accept them because you’ll learn more from them than your W’s
I never liked Omarosa ... never met anyone who actually did. She is the Vegemite of humans. #GirlBye
Fun fact... Roy Moore speaks fluent Russian... Let that sink in... The same guy who thinks same sex marriage should be illegal and that slavery was good for the south... WHAT THE F*CK?!
Get ready... December 18th...New MUSIC VIDEO... #SaveMe https://t.co/Lp8lKenXpl
And just like the @fyKAWS website is frozen 🙃
Happy Hanukkah 💙💙💙
Great , now @garyvee has me tearing up in TRACK 6:PARENTS ... I get the sense he’s a great entrepreneur , but now I know he’s an even better FATHER. Now that is the real way to CRUSH it....with LOVE
Stay safe New York...
Only @garyvee could record a rant mixtape on a plane. Meanwhile I’m sitting in a middle seat between two toddlers watching their iPads as I’m trying to CRUSH it. #TheAirplaneProject
Let’s be real...CARDI B had the best 2017 ever. No one has had a better year than her. She somehow became America’s sweetheart and top female rapper!
Already loving @garyvee’s THE PLANE PROJECT... been listening all morning.
Whoa. Wait. I just fell in love watching @lorde on @bleachersmusic unplugged. My goodness she’s epic! 🖤🖤🖤
So @JohnMayer’s Walt Grace submarine ride continues to be his low-key best song....very underrated.
My cuddle buddy on this cold day ❤️🐶🌨 https://t.co/EsgTQraisa
Happy Saturday! https://t.co/UbHcefnPHY
The bromance between @samsheffer &amp; @CaseyNeistat is real. And I’m kinda jealous I can’t be the third musketeer
Currently filming a music video near @CaseyNeistat’s office and its providing me with much needed inspiration/motivation
Thank you...
Please @Everlane can you restock your Long Parkas...cuz I need a good winter coat and its been sold out forever 😥😭😰
I think @PhillyD should put this in #TodayInAwesome Makes you truly appariciae the only currency we have is our TIME.... (and bitcoin) https://t.co/gT0UvHhpfJ
Please don’t ever become a stranger,whose laugh I could recognize anywhere... #NewYearsDay @taylorswift13 #reputation
I vote that @CaseyNeistat , @petermckinnon &amp; @maxjoseph should create &amp; produce the #YouTubeRewind of 2018.
The only thing I’m looking for in this #YouTubeRewind2017 is if @PhillyD is in it after all these years?
Stay safe California...hope everyone is ok.
You either DO...or you DON’T. Embrace the black &amp; white and all the gray in-between ... https://t.co/2TWA7eTG2X
I’m just sitting here hoping @JohnMayer is okay after his hospital visit... 🙏🏻
Always a good time for coffee☕️☕️☕️ Espcially if it’s @IrvingFarm cafe! https://t.co/M0an6zKPjI
Today is gonna be AMAZING because I just heard that @Eminem has a sign coming out featuring @edsheeran ... Can’t wait for this! #Revival
If you get stuck in the idea that where you are is where you're gonna stay, then you'll be frozen in space and time by you're own fear....
@AndreaL11408765 Sorry you feel that way, I simply wanted to say hi to a friend. Hope you have a great day.
Miss you friend @Camila_Cabello! Hope all is good and congrats on all the well deserved success! Love ya! 🙏🏻😊💙
@plated who do I reach out to about an issue with my order?
To all my #Camilizers and fellow lovers of @Camila_Cabello ...Just know that I was there since DAY 1...And will always support her and her music! (Plus it helps that she's a super kind, and funny person and pranked me on tour) https://t.co/TrA8FuiITb
When you take @garyvee’s $1.80 strategy and FLIP IT to a $2.60 strategy and I’m SEEING RESULTS! #MondayMotivation #Hustle
Tweets about @Camila_Cabello once...and my phones notifications go absolutely crazy...then my battery overheats and kills my iPhoneX
“Banana ooo nah nah...” -@Camila_Cabello
Anyone remember playing Pokémon Go? Cuz I don’t ...
@justward88 Incredible. It’s taken me 4 days to adapt and learn but I’m already seeing a build up on COMMUNITY!
Nothing like a little $1.80 Biz Dev on a Saturday night @garyvee ... This strategy has changed my whole hustle in less than a week! 🙏🏻
It’s ok to be scared, but don’t run away in fear. Run towards the monsters so they don’t become something even scarier...mistakes.
Is Obama just sitting around hanging out being like...”oh,this is totally fine”

I got really high the other day ... 🤯 https://t.co/Vbdvbpui2V
Whenever I’m feeling sad and lonely I just take a breath,sit in the silence and then loudly and clearly sing...”JASOOOOOON DERULOOOOOO” and suddenly I’m calm again @jasonderulo
@realDonaldTrump Ummm no...
Life is BLACK &amp; WHITE ... Life is BINARY ... You either DO or you DON’T https://t.co/aqzO5ASjBV
So far @garyvee’s $1.80 strategy is tiring and seems futile but it’s those little victories that will allow me to win...I’M PUTTING IN HOURS TO GET RESULTS... #ItsBinary #GaryVee #Hustle
Just found out that @edsheeran is releasing a version of #Perfect with the godly figure that is @Beyonce ... Prepare for feeling ALL THE FEELS!!! 🔥🔥🔥
The amount of sexual abuse/assault is incredible...Both my mom and my older sister have experienced it. I haven’t met a woman who hasn’t...
Just realizing today after everything that has happened in the news with respect to women and sexual assault. I never really understood how many women have dealt with assault on some level...It's shocking and a shame
🔥“Hold on to the memories,they will hold on to you...” #Reputation @taylorswift13 🔥
I wore my heart on my sleeve and made a mess of things...
I guess this Captain America and Hulk didn’t make it in the #InfinityWarTrailer today... https://t.co/2Ga0dROsSa
Our “President” retweeted videos of people dying...How doesn’t that violate @Twitter’s terms of service? But I say FUCK too many times and I get suspended?
If it’s us or them...who would you choose?
There is no defending @realDonaldTrump ... he needs to be removed from office,banned on twitter and indicted...
You can try, or you can let things be....I prefer to do both.
Today I thought bitcoin could hit 10K...I had NO IDEA it would come close to hitting 11K?!?
If it just a matter of time for success, then I'm gonna work hard and be so damn patient...
@TeamOTFit @garyvee I've seen one or two comments or mentions. multiply that by the 31 days in a month and the 12 months in a year that could be 365 new followers or people to check my stuff out. just need that one, to change the game
Ill keep hustling &amp; grinding til I get to one day have a face to face with @garyvee ...It'll come. And When I do, Ill bring up this tweet...It's binary. I've got questions for him, but more over I want to thank him. #PhoneIsStillHot #garyvee
Heard @garyvee’s new $1.80 Instagram strategy and I haven’t stopped all day. My phone is literally HOT and low on battery but I’m putting in those hours, comments, and dedication to COMMUNITY ... #Jab #garyvee #hustle
Hold me close...Hold me tight...I don’t want to be alone tonight...
Sometimes it’s ok to feel sad...
I want to see @donaldglover win the Grammy ...
the edge of tomorrow is just beyond the reach of today...
Feeling some type of way...Not sure what I should do...When all that I can think about...is being next to you...🥀🥀🥀
It's dark out at 5:15 and I don't know what I want for dinner....😣😣😣
I got really high today. 🚁 #nyc https://t.co/H4CPUXOY5J

@meghantonjes Happppoooooy Bday BB
Sorry @taylorswift13 ... I now have a new favorite song on #Reputation and it’s DELICATE...this one has all the feels! 🔥🔥🔥
@mantalksswift She crushed that song!
@T_S_Rep_ I have no relation to Calvin Harris...Not all of us are bad ;) Taylor is the queen of pop right now!
@dazedangels You are cute and have great taste as wel!
@CapGurl89 YES! Facts
@WANEGBT_stan @wally_lw @taylorswift13 Just being honest. Taylor has always been great! But these songs are perfectly crafted and hit you right in the feels...
Embrace the people and things that you love...Let them surround you...
@HuffleBoy @taylorswift13 Dude. This could be the best album yet. Currently digging New Years Day, Don’t Blame Me,Delicate, and End Game...all are SO DAMN FIRE! 🐍🐍🐍
Wow...this @taylorswift13 “Don’t Blame Me” is a banger...
I’ve learned to love the struggle...it makes the success taste better...
Hey @UrbanOutfitters I ordered stuff for my photoshoot and somehow half of it has shipped but not the other half? Please help... @UOHelpMe #UOHelpMe
I’ll take my broken heart and put it back in the cupboard...Nothing scares me more than a dull life in the suburbs
Headed to #Nashville for some music writing and good times!
The year 2017 is like the deleted scenes on a shitty dvd that you bought at the bargain-bin at a gas station...
It is incredibly hard to want someone &amp; you start to sense they don’t feel the same. That lurking feeling,That unrequited love. There’s always the one the that got away but what about the one in front of you that doesn’t want you back...🖤
Headed to Nashville this week to write some new tunes! https://t.co/90SzyqPDRw

Currently having a @RickandMorty marathon....
Sorry, rant over. I just want music to be good and for the people making it to be authentic and real...
So when @KEEMSTAR makes a song, I believe they’re doing it cuz they want 2 make good music just like @TheGabbieShow &amp; @troyesivan and others
If you’re a “Youtuber” and you’re gonna make music. Then PLEASE do it becuase you want to make good music. Not just scam your fans.
Like imagine if @CaseyNeistat or @DavidDobrik tried to go make a song? These other vloggers just make horrible music to get their fans $$$
Don’t get me wrong, there are so many great vloggers who have had made great music but it’s obvious when someone is just doing it for $$$
There are so many talented musicians and artists I don’t understand how some “daily vloggers” try to put out songs that are trash
When @KEEMSTAR likes your tweet, you low-key know he’s gonna put it in a drama alert! 🐍
Ummm @KEEMSTAR did you hear @erikacostell’s new SONG!?! Please roast this snake 🐍🐍🐍

Genuinely asking if there are @realDonaldTrump supporters who think he should STOP TWEETING? I'm actually wondering if they're out there?
If you voted for @realDonaldTrump then can you at least agree he shouldn't be tweeting about awards shows &amp; should be focusing on the USA? 🙃

Losing Eileen has made me incredibly sad...But it also has inspired me to live my life to the fullest and work my ass off on my music...
Eileen did a great job as a manager but she did an even better job as a friend, mentor, and 2nd mother...She was one of a kind
To anyone who ever met my manager Eileen Denobile then you knew how amazingly sweet she was. She was also a bad ass,tough,hard working woman
No one makes it out alive...No one will be here forever...Go tell someone you love them just because there will be a day where you can't...
My manager for over 10 years passed away. She was a huge part of my life &amp; I'm still sad she is gone, But I will carry her memory with me...
The goal is to be financially comfortable, internally satisfied, unconditionally loved, emotionally stable and continuously charitable...
Thank you everyone who has every supported me. I wanted to take a moment to tell any one and everyone that I love them
I lost someone today that I loved dearly. She was my manager &amp; like a mother to me. Eileen, wherever you are,just know I'll always love you

How is it fair that @realDonaldTrump can block someone on twitter? That's kinda fucked up..Is speech really free? or do we pay the price?
I'm pretty sure that @KellyannePolls sold her soul to the devil...How else could you explain the heartless way in which she conducts herself

The truth is that, none of us really know the truth. So just enjoy this ride called life for as long as you can...
