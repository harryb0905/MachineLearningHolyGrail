Yo I’m sorry. Who’s Markelle Fultz shooting coach? There are mechanics you can teach to balance the disconnect
The problem with players in the nba now is that they get paid what they deserve. 100’s of millions. But then forget it’s a team sport. Who cares about the money you signed. It’s guys making billions. Become family and dominate!
