@rgay Oh, Roxane. Let me mansplain. What our friend is trying to say is that Hillary is not The President. As you’re a woman, you may have misunderstood. Not your fault. Now, don’t forget to smile! You’ll look so much prettier. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

The more I think about it, the more I’m sure @EricGreitens behavior is exactly the type of twisted masculinity that @michaelianblack wrote so eloquently about recently. #WeCanDoBetter
This @EricGreitens story is so utterly disappointing. I met him at a @GotYourSix event years back and was truly impressed. Smart. Charismatic. Doing great charitable work. Now we know him better, and it makes me sad.

@JamesGunn “On both sides. On both sides.”
Watching @MagiciansSYFY reminds me, the old school 1 EP a week distribution model wins. The suspense is KILLING ME! I LOVE IT! 😁😬😁
@Mike_M_Morgan Psychopathy is real. Sociopathic behavior is real. They are diagnosable. They are treatable. “Evil” isn’t a diagnosis, it’s an excuse.
@MaddoxAlan @GiaJudge This is exactly my point. An “evil heart” gives us an excuse to turn away. It’s too easy, and does nothing to prevent the next “evil heart”
@Mike_M_Morgan Horrors, all. But perpetrated by us, to us. “Evil” allows us to remove ourselves from the equation. “Evil” absolves us from responsibility. “Evil” isn’t real. We are real. The choices we make are real, and they are choices.
Don’t let anyone tell you “evil” is ever responsible for anything. “Evil” is an excuse. “Evil” is “other”. There’s no other. There’s just us. If we don’t like what’s happening, we can change it. In America, we can change it.
