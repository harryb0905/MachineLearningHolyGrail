The deliberate, systemic nature of our approach to reopening is reflective of our overarching concern for citizen health and safety.
Our Copley Square Re-entry Plan is a multi-agency effort to maximize all team resources.
My team has been hard at work developing a plan to reopen Boylston St to the public, as respectfully, seamlessly and quickly as we can.

One of the great blessings of the job was meeting 1/2 the people who live in this city. I just did what I loved and then it wasn't too hard.
I will find a way to thank all of you and to celebrate together. But first, we have much work to do. I have no intention of letting up yet.
I am here today with the people I love, to tell the city I love, that I will leave the job I love.
