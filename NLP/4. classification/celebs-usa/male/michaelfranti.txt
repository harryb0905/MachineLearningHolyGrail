are willing to go the extra step, mile or smile to succeed at their own dreams, stand up courageously for those in need and be their authentic selves through the joys, heartbreaks and dances of life.
We are all incredibly grateful for each of your well wishes prayers and messages of encouragement. Sara and I believe in raising children that can see the beauty in the differences of others, have kindness and empathy for those who come from different life experiences and
We’ve been going through the excitement and challenges of newborn parenting and are savoring every squeal, smile, grunt, cry, sneeze, diaper, fart, middle of the night soothing and feeding of this precious new addition to our family.
They both were forced to stand up for their beliefs and bestowed in their children great examples of sacrificing for family and a love of education. It is also a Persian name meaning ‘incomparable’ or ‘beautiful’.
His middle name ‘Badi’, is the name of his great grandfathers on both Sara’s mom’s side and Dad’s side, both of whom were joyful and kind men who also happened to be very tall and lived very humble lives while facing religious persecution for being of The Baha’i Faith in Iran.
Taj Badi Franti was born at 6:22am on September 10th 2018 weighing in at a sturdy 9 pounds 13 ounces and 22 inches in length! His first name ‘Taj’ is the Persian word for ‘crown’. https://t.co/2y1b6RNsma

Regina holds a special place in our hearts. As you know, it’s where I saw Sara in the crowd and my life was changed forever. Fast forward to now - #FutureFranti’s comin’ in hot.

Build trust with Syrians and support their resistance. #refugeesfirst
If we want to build trust with Syrians to support them overthrowing Assad we need to help the millions who've had to flee. #syrianrefugees
There are 13.5 mil #Syrians in need of aid. You can't ban them all from coming to US, drop a few missiles in their country and say "we care"
@ragarse3 @MikeHudema @Estreetman60 Perhaps we could agree helping a few million of the 13.6 million Syrian refugees would be a good place to start?
@ragarse3 @MikeHudema @Estreetman60 Perhaps we should think it through before we sign up for it? #iraq #afghan and in the mean time there are 13.6 mil Syrians needing aid.
In January 2017, UNHCR counted 4,863,684 registered Syrian refugees. If we really want to help them Why aren't we letting any into the USA?
2016 the UN identified 13.5 million Syrians requiring aid more than 6 million are internally displaced within Syria, 4.8 million outside.
@ragarse3 @MikeHudema @Estreetman60 And the end result to this most recent bombing is.....???  Will be....???

@familyventure to me not playing NC isn't as proactive as playing, speaking up, getting people to sign petition, raising funds for equality
@familyventure we also did a separate yoga/music event raising 10k$ for LGBTQ groups in NC, who are working to repeal HB2 laws
@familyventure every show I do is in support of equality. If I didn't play every place I saw injustice i'd have nowhere to play
