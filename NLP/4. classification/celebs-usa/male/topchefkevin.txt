Thanks everyone for chatting with me tonight. Had a lot of fun! #Foodiechats
@AnOrchidInBloom @DietitianSherry @RickGriffin I support that decisions!
Many ppl request this at @GunshowATL. Good thing meat is gluten free so I can work with that, like with cider infused ribs. #Foodiechats
I grew up making beer, cider, wine, and mead with my dad. #Foodiechats
I also think the classic flavors around the holidays go great with @AngryOrchard Strawman. #Foodiechats
I prefer the Cider House Collection over champagne a lot of the time ‚Äì to me, they have a more dynamic flavor profile.  #Foodiechats
@SousVideCuisine @AngryOrchard def instead of wine. It is not a direct substitute for sugar, but does bring sweetness to a dish
@swandie27 Absolutely
Cider can be used as a base and a substitute for beef broth or stock, which can make for rich flavorful dishes or sauces. #Foodiechats
@DiningTraveler @Foodiechats @AngryOrchard That pie looks epic!
In the summer, my all-time favorite dessert is a little bit of sugar on Georgia peaches served with fresh heavy cream. #Foodiechats
For the spring, any simple fresh berry dessert ‚Äì like a raspberry tart or a strawberry shortcake. #Foodiechats
Using cider in your marinades &amp; sauces will help you to achieve that perfect golden brown grill mark color you‚Äôre looking for. #Foodiechats
I love grilling wings, like with this recipe for Churraso Chicken Wings with @AngryOrchard Chimichurri: http://t.co/sCpbXMebyx #Foodiechats
@A_Bloke_Cooking  @Foodiechats Absolutely. The drier ciders  from @AngryOrchard can be used just like white wine. Perfect for fish dishes
@aMusingFoodie @AngryOrchard That sounds AMAZING!!!
I recently did hopped cider oysters with @AngryOrchard Hop‚Äôn Mad Apple. #Foodiechats
@carloseats @AngryOrchard It's not quite cheescake, but here's a meringue pie: http://t.co/VwLEOnxBIk #FoodieChats
@DinaDeleasaG @Foodiechats @AngryOrchard That is definitely on the list of dishes to work on
@Foodiechats @AnOrchidInBloom It starts with great locally sourced pork. Then keep it simple. On the grill till med-rare, then let it rest!
@laurencalo I‚Äôve made a great grilled cheese w/@AngryOrchard and grilled vegetables! #FoodieChats
A fruit-forward cider like @AngryOrchard can complement and calm the smoky, spicy notes you typically find in BBQ dishes. #Foodiechats
@DJPaulaB @Foodiechats @AngryOrchard NO....but I'm thinking about it now...#Foodiechats
I love to marinade with hard cider because it will give your meats the brown caramelization and that sweet crust you want. #FoodieChats
@ChefColonnade I‚Äôm a big fan of these slow cooked country style BBQ ribs: http://t.co/yM3i5Khlm6 #FoodieChats
My favorite way to prepare pork is a traditional American BBQ ‚Äì I really love cooking over an open fire. #FoodieChats
@lePetiteChef @AngryOrchard Beautiful work chef! #Foodiechats
@SmithTia Try this recipe for cider spiked churrasco chicken wings: http://t.co/sCpbXMebyx #FoodieChats
@carloseats @Uleletampa @AngryOrchard That looks delicioius! #Foodiechats
I love cooking with hard cider ‚Äì it‚Äôs so versatile. It can be used as a marinade, a sauce, and of course, a beverage pairing. #Foodiechats

EXCELLENT!!! pork belly dish @BaoBei1. The entire meal was splendid. Modern Chinese Brasserie...we need that in ATL http://t.co/l4NHEsyc4v
I wonder if the world has ever known a discreetly ironed shirt, cause every ironing board I open screams like its being mauled by a werewolf

Nothing makes you feel like an old man quite like putting sunscreen on your bald spot...
I was too drunk to share with you all yesterday, but suffice it to say we had great tastings @AnticaTerra, @Bergstromwines, and @Trisaetum.
It's rare, as a chef, that you have an opportunity to see something brand new. I had that today @kachkapdx. So cool!! http://t.co/oZCFddiIOO
I have to say...@OxPDX is a real gem not only for Portland, but the current american restaurant world. It is a true home run in every way.
Cinnamon Snickerdoodle ice cream @saltandstraw might be my new favorite flavor. P.S. I LOVE CINNAMON!!!

Cinco de Mayo is a perfect day to grill. Keep the cleanup easy by brushing the grates while they are still hot. #Formula409
Gillespie = Giuseppe at every airport in America it seems. Although the differences are subtle, I assure you they are different names.
It is a rare place where you never need to look at a menu and yet you know every dish will be exceptional. Thank you @UMISushiATL
@Hank_Shaw @KUIU I'd have a pretty wicked case of swampass if I hunted in jeans. Keep on kicking ass old school Hank!
@Hank_Shaw have you used any gear from @KUIU ? I'm headed out west to hunt Aoudad and need to layer up. I like their story.

To anyone who read a recent article where I am "quoted" on food allergies, many of my words r out of context. Sorry to have offended.
@Gfreegimme3 @mandersqb I wish I had never agreed to the interview. It did a disservice to a serious issue that I deal with daily. Sorry.
@Gfreegimme3 @mandersqb unfortunately there are a lot of people who are. That does not make us any less concerned about our guests wellness
@mandersqb dining out is a pleasure we should all enjoy. However I am honest to people on when I can't work around their restrictions.
@mandersqb NOT WHAT I SAID. 1hr interview shortened into an article leads to out of context content. We serve people with Celiac everyday.
@mandersqb @Gfreegimme3 misquoted! We take all allergies seriously. However we cannot always accommodate them due to our service style.
@Gfreegimme3 @FoodAllergyGal the message was people who claim an allergy that they dont have. Dishonesty hurts those who have serious issues

@Your_Grammar Thank you for the correction. I sleep better at night knowing someone is looking out for me.
Their is no excuse for cut blocking still being legal. Apparently player safety only applies to offensive skill positions.
@AnnaRuth I believe in you! Let me know how you like it
@mattyjakes your best bet is to stretch it with the most neutral flavored oil you have on hand. Use as little as possible
@BBQgeek tomato paste, dry mustard, pepper vinegar, and a few select other ingredients that I am not at liberty to share
@theangrychef @EaterAtlanta my suggestion is to inquire with Ford Fry. I bet he has someone working on it
@dictate_this how about a sweet potato muffn. Everybody loves a little sweet treat
@AyNamm check out the Brussels sprout gratin from my book "Fire in my Belly"
@jsquared34 anything under the skin will flavor the meat. Stuff on the outside seasons the skin. Stick with seasoned butter under the skin.
@mattyjakes it is delicious. Just be careful that you don't get it too salty. Turkey is less forgiving than some other meats
@ZagatAtlanta I'm a dressing guy. Keep it out of the bird and make mine cornbread
@kelseyagnew try your hand at aligot potatoes. Classic french cheesy potatoes. Your family will love them
@KellyKrammes other than coffee.....I love wassail! Its very festive, with or without alcohol

@jrlogan22 roasted turkey butter. Pan roast some scraps in butter with sage and garlic. You'll love it
@sweetfrnchtoast simple mix of brown sugar, kosher salt, 1 onion, 2 heads of garlic, and a bunch of sage. Add water till its ocean h2o salty
@ksm roasted jalape√±os and bacon will take corn casserole to the next level
I'm in the Thanksgiving spirit. If you have any questions or need tips for a successful T-day feel free to ask. I'll do my best to help.
@JeffDauler never said I didn't like it.....I happen to love hot dogs
@atlanta19892011 @TheBertShow its seems like a common choice....albeit risky
@BertShowBert I had a blast. Love to stop by again soon
@VanSlamProper please brine it. Those turkeys are notoriously dry. I also suggest putting butter under the skin and cooking breast side down
@underwoodjk @TheBertShow  great method, but very dangerous. Do it away from the house &amp; always check the oil level 1st. Don't overfill!
@ccr1018 I like the infared turkey cookers that Charbroil makes. Just remember to dry the outside before you cook it....key to crispy skin
@FrankNunez86 @TheBertShow fat is your friend. Plenty of cream &amp; cheese....&amp; use frozen corn. The fresh stuff is not good this time of year.

I just power housed 4 cups of coffee in the time it took to rock out to freebird....I think I have a problem. Possibly several.
I would be happy to cook over an open fire for the rest of my career. I love how much the food world has advanced, but all I need is fire.
NYE menu @ Woodfire is looking good: Slow roasted pork belly &amp; smoked loin w/ German style cabbage, apple butter &amp; sweet &amp; sour onion salad.
@williebosshog rewatched the episode w/ the Men vs Women cookoff. I am volunteering my services 2 help the men win next yr. Redneck Chef!

In good company. I am especially happy about being next to the @Southern_Living tailgating book. http://t.co/7pyQdJyl

My sis in law is home. Babysitting over. I made cinnamon rolls, let her take out every toy she owns, &amp; changed a VERY messy diaper. Success!

for anyone who wants to eat pork belly the way it should be prepared, come to Woodfire Grill
crushing blow.
this is my favorite part. its like getting hit with a sack of door knobs
I prefer pork belly not to be so soft that its mush. I think steven starr hates pork. sucks to be him.
For the record: both of the Voltaggio's are amazing chefs and amazing people. Its hard to compete against people you like.
bacon dessert? maybe not the best idea.
bryan's dish was fucking awesome. holy shit.
