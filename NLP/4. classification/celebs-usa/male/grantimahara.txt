@negaoryx I just need you to look into the flashy light thingie for just a second...
The recent snow in Los Angeles was caused by an unprecedented cold snap and had absolutely nothing to do with a protype weather-altering machine which I may or may not be working on.
@TheLastSavage1 @NASA I absolutely did! Not many people remember this but I really liked it!!
Congrats on an amazing mission @NASA! https://t.co/DmZN98qyMC
Cool circle rainbow/shadow effect on my flight today: https://t.co/RrXPF8XbCC
@GarrettRWang He wasn‚Äôt sure *which* handsome Asian man to believe! üòÄ
Congrats @NASAInSight!! #Mars
Thank you to all those who have heroically served and sacrificed. Veterans in my family include two great uncles, one great aunt, and my father. #VeteransDay2018
@RachelDayFX @MikeOkuda I‚Äôd have to defer to @MikeOkuda here. Maybe Greg Jein could authenticate?
Excelsior, good sir. You will be missed. #RIPStanLee
@tweetsoutloud Happy birthday, good sir!

Day off in Detroit. Resting in the hotel. Turn on TV. Immediately get caught in a 4-hour NCIS loop.
Dangit! The robot is a better dancer than me. https://t.co/PK6sgcWfpJ
Happy 60th @NASA! Can‚Äôt wait to watch this documentary. https://t.co/364WlV8qoW
At the airport at 6:30am. So many questionable breakfast choices: greasy Chinese food, greasy pizza, fish. Fish?? I‚Äôll stick with bacon and eggs. It‚Äôs a game of predicting future problems.
That‚Äôs the first time in a long time we‚Äôve had thunder and lightning in LA.
@EarthLove245 @anki @MouserElec His name is Vector!
Could you develop a relationship with a robot?  In this episode of #GenerationRobot, I‚Äôll take you under the hood of Vector, the latest in personal robotic companions from @anki https://t.co/gqNSdcpRA8 @MouserElec https://t.co/3ntyzLeMdI
@RobotMakerGirl @make @MythBusters @makerfaire Wow I‚Äôm so honored Allie! Congrats on #MythBustersJr and remember, Failure Is Always An Option!
@KariByron It‚Äôs seriously giving me physical anxiety just watching the video.
@KariByron NOPE. https://t.co/AeBBKMTVdO
Thanks for having me speak at #3Dbasecamp this year @SketchUp! I kind of wanted to take my scale figure home, but then decided one of me is already enough around the house. https://t.co/Mh9USER7TU

@alyankovic Congrats, good sir!! Well deserved after all your significant contributions to pop culture. Sorry I could not be there to celebrate!
@AgentM All the responses. Eeeeeewww This is the worst game of bingo ever.
@erikaishii And you as well Erika!! You bring so much excited, positive energy into the world.
@cmlwilson @mariancall Time traveler.
@AgentM Just need crying baby and mystery fart person and it‚Äôs BINGO!
@erikaishii Yes it has!
@hollyamos22 He‚Äôs clearly the brains of that particular operation.
To all my Hawaii friends, I hope you are all safe and tucked in and prepared for #HurricaneLane! Stay safe!!
@bnacker I caught a fish THIS BIG
@KariByron So... you know that mind control interface you tried on @ToryBelleci with the electrodes? Yeah, imagine it controlling a pair of robot legs. Or even a whole body. Same interface! Reads electrical impulses from your muscles. https://t.co/YIA2rbOT4Y
@RowanStrang @reckless Convenience for the user and familiarity with a known interface.
@Daemond6 Yes, it‚Äôs from an episode called Vector Vengeance. I triggered the air cannon that fires the ball manually.
Excited to bring you the next episode of #GenerationRobot from @MouserElec: Robotic Exo-skeletons with a company in Japan called Cyberdyne. Yes, Cyberdyne. https://t.co/DU0tRwYHIV https://t.co/LsNGsfpDvf
Congrats to @CrazyRichMovie on a stellar $34M opening box office! Representation is important and this is a landmark movie for Asian Americans. To support it, I personally bought out two showings: one in LA and one in SF for the #GoldOpen. #CrazyRichAsians https://t.co/qJzHkXZCU6
@kenjeong Just saw #CrazyRichAsians with an entire theater full of my friends. DUDE you killed it!! :)
Can‚Äôt wait!! https://t.co/NMmPfl4oDw
@Spionnadh At that speed, all solid state.
Cant wait to show you the next episode I‚Äôm filming for @MouserElec about robotics. This one deals with robots to help with human mobility. Went to Japan to talk to the folks at Cyberdyne. Should be up at the end of this month! https://t.co/MuYXV5Crxy
Day off from filming in Japan. Decided to take a Shinkansen bullet train. Current speed: 255 kph, or about 159 mph.
Happy 60th birthday @NASA!!
@wilw Happy birthday, good sir!
That time I went to Comic Con and things got a little... crazy. Also, there was a monkey at the party (not related to this picture). Thanks for the awesome time @_AlexHirsch! https://t.co/jopdStQI1J
That time I went to Japan and stayed at a hotel entirely staffed by robots. It was... strange. https://t.co/490UFKgM11
@PootKlopp Can confirm that was NOT me. But now I really want to see it!
Seeing your clothes in a museum is such a strange experience. https://t.co/j0eaf8nugq
The costume/prop room from @Mythbusters: The Explosive Exhibition at @fleetscience. Lots of memories here! https://t.co/L4yfEO9kSG
@TomFelton Dude I can‚Äôt wait to watch Origin!
No actual people were harmed in the crushing today. Except for this ‚Äúzombie‚Äù @Discovery #SharkWeek premieres Sunday at 8pm. https://t.co/YH0Jl6lbRB
@FoxyKazoo We have the same favorite Doctor (10 of course) and compared cosplay.
@alisonhaislip FINALLY
About to meet up with my friends to feed stuff to a giant mechanical shark to chomp on. If you want to witness the carnage, be at the Petco parking lot at noon. Just look for the hydraulic robot shark that‚Äôs as big as a semi. Shouldn‚Äôt be hard to miss.
Quick pic with @KariByron @ToryBelleci from our talk last night at @fleetscience! Thanks everyone for coming to see us. Next up, panel tonight 7pm Room 6DE https://t.co/h8htudc7g9
@diannedoan Good luck at comic con! YOU‚ÄôLL NEED IT
@LanaMcKissack Thanks to you, I now know what ‚Äúmaking out with a fish means‚Äù. And I‚Äôm still on the fence about subscribing to your YouTube channel. @diannedoan
Here‚Äôs an interview I did for @Tormach about my 770 mill, my philosophy on CNC machining, and a preview of my BB-8 and its drive system: https://t.co/6K27uXUmxD
We‚Äôre coming back to Comic Con! @karibyron @torybelleci and I will be opening the @MythBusters exhibit at @fleetscience and you can join us for the festivities!! https://t.co/q1UhAMD51J
Driving to lunch from the Imagineering campus and a squirrel actually crossed the street in a crosswalk and that‚Äôs probably the most Disney thing I‚Äôve seen since I‚Äôve been here.
Apparently if you log into the chat, you can donate money and make them do things to me when I get there. WAIT I DIDNAE SIGN UP FOR THIS FELICIA oh wait I did. uhhh... go easy on me guys? guys?? https://t.co/3qqkLjDAPw
@AnneWheaton @scalzi Can confirm. Bonus if she has extra toes. https://t.co/Jzgdp7svuj

@NathanFillion I dunno. Looks saright to me.
@feliciaday This has been all of us at one time or another. Anyone who says different is lying.
Heads up! I'll finally be returning to @BattleBots judging alongside @tweetsoutloud and @derekbruceyoung. Join us at 8pm on @Discovery! #LetTheBotBattleBegin https://t.co/rzCL6VWgTM
@Nick_H_Engineer @MythBusters @KariByron @ToryBelleci Thanks! Those were drawn by my talented pal @AngelaSongArt!
I‚Äôm doing an offbeat trivia show with @mariabamfoo called @GoFactYourPod this Sunday 6/24 at 7pm at Angel City Brewery in LA! Free tickets here:  https://t.co/LF5vdmEGwI Join us!!
Here‚Äôs a time warp for you: 25 years ago, Jurassic Park premiered in theaters.
On my way to the Saved By the Bell diner, I passed a Shakey‚Äôs Pizza and reminisced about their cardboard pizza and that‚Äôs the most 90‚Äôs thing I‚Äôve said in a long time.
@KariByron That‚Äôs two of the easier tasks
@RubyDiceMusic Enjoyed you at Dizzy Rooster tonight!
Got to play with all kinds of robots, big and small, and discuss the future of robots and humans working together at @KUKA_RoboticsUS! Watch the video here: https://t.co/TNd9eF6Yef

These pictures from the #metgala look like a Fifth Element sequel.
@JeanneB1962 D‚Äôoh! You‚Äôre right!!
@PhysicistChris There‚Äôs a MacGuyver in each of us. Some are more destructive than others.
@BOOMSlCKA üòé
This Friday I‚Äôll be on an @IEEEorg panel about the Future of AI and Robotics w/ @CynthiaBreazeal @BostonDynamics and @ToyotaResearch. (ie The beginning of the secret super group that saves humanity from the robot apocalypse.)
MacGuyver moment on my plane ride: unstuck my tray table by using the butter pat from my meal to grease the rails. #stillgotit
Congrats @NASA on  the successful launch of #InSight! There was heavy fog at the launch site, so we didn‚Äôt see much, but we definitely heard it!
@chrisowens1983 Designed and built my own
@JenniferLanda Hahaha their loss!
@sheenaduquette Yin and Yang cats!
@JenniferLanda In Union Station!
@jessiepridemore @DaveOshry I was like whaaa...??? OH! hahahaha. Evanescence FTW

@scalzi @neilhimself @no_relation That was a long book tour. You could use a vacation. Aruba? Jamaica? Bermuda? Bahama?
@HomerLXIX Great song!
@ThreeDayPass @StuseyBoy Wait, what? This just gets more and more bizarre
@evil_angel636 I too was a huge Phil Collins fan. All because of Miami Vice
@neilhimself @no_relation @scalzi Never gonna give you up
@Helioglyph @scalzi Gonna take a lot to take me away from you.
@scalzi I‚Äôm your Private Dancer. A dancer for money. I‚Äôll do what you want me to.
@JohnStandlee That was among my first albums after Madonna!
@scalzi Teach them well and let them lead the way.
@scalzi I believe the children are our future.
@Freckles_IRL Ah from the Cocktail soundtrack!
@JasonBujnosek Absolutely!
@OJessicaNigri ZOMG
@johnroderick Dude. Mine was a pale yellow Ford Pinto hatchback.
@OJessicaNigri Is this one of those things where you start with ‚ÄúOne time‚Äù and let the predictive text finish the rest? Orrrr??
@clarkvalentine With or Without You bore the brunt of my teenage angst (what little I had).
@StuseyBoy Roly poly fish heads, eat them up yum?
@alyankovic Many of my followers have listed you as the first piece of music they bought themselves. I salute you, good sir!
@Jillbles Both EXCELLENT songs!
@grnbayhusker Oh yes, that was my other favorite. Excellent song!
@TheLastSavage1 If I go there will be trouble. If I stay it will be double!
@WriteMyWrong OH MAN I haven‚Äôt thought of Columbia House in such a long time! I couldn‚Äôt help but feel weird getting all these CDs for a penny
@AmandaRex That‚Äôs one of those albums that helped define the era
@StuseyBoy That album was such a strange mix of old and new songs, and it somehow worked
@luisbermudez That album had a raw kind of energy. His videos were so cool!
@katesdragon1 Bang bang
@TheLastSavage1 I confess I bought that one but only listened to Should I Stay or Should I Go
@DuluthErikMD Cassette singles ftw
@grnbayhusker Take Me to the Other Side was my jam. Tho I was always puzzled by the fiddle-type prelude
@HeatherGreye Ah yes I had both of those. One two punch of Danger Zone and Dancing in the Dark
@xoyzite I listened to every song on this album so many times!
@scalzi I just watched The Eighties and they played a clip of her singing it and it *almost* got stuck in my brain.
@AnneWheaton @bonniegrrl https://t.co/GWGM3s4oHF
That is a whole lot of 80‚Äôa nostalgia in one sentence right there. https://t.co/vLROasSZGo
@DreamKittyCos True fact: Torn is one of my favorite songs of all time.
@prettyinblackxx Oh yeah She Bop was my jam. So many hits on that album
@christine_says_ Ah so good! Diamonds on the Soles or Her Shoes
@lemahevad Great album, but my go-to was Listen Like Thieves
@swampbuggy65 I heard the opening chords of Head Over Heels in my head as I read this. Funny thing: I had to play through the lyrics in my head until I got to the song title because I couldn‚Äôt remember it!!
@jamesmehaffey Synchronicity??
@PurityKnights They played this on the documentary and I had to watch Billie Jean immediately after on YouTube.
@abulletaway69 This gif is amazing.
@CPCSMuse Last Train To Clarksville and Daydream Believer are still some of my favorites
@Emwsabre521 You are possibly older than me.
@shauncbutts We had KROQ in LA for alternative. Sadly they didn‚Äôt come out with any compilation albums
@ChasingGeekdom I too listed to Whodini! Friends. Freaks Come Out at Night. LOL
@319E17th Still one of my favorites
@williamJnewman Good album! So many hits
Watching the excellent series The Eighties made me think: What was the first piece of music you ever bought for yourself? I‚Äôll go first. Mine was Madonna‚Äôs debut album in 1983. On cassette. #firstmusic
@AnneWheaton Just giving you more options to express yourself through unconventional headwear!

@astVintageSpace @NASAInSight ME!!! I hope I can make it...
@billprady Yeah, it‚Äôs the worst LOL
@AgnesGarbowska I totally didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what the show was about until I saw a trailer recently. I‚Äôve added it to my watch list!!
@micholaus @travismcelroy @BattleBots Don‚Äôt tell anyone, but all celebrity geeks know each other...

@AnnaAkana I‚Äôm totally bringing this look back.
@sheenaduquette It‚Äôs going to be awesome!!
@YurisNight So, @BattleBots wrapped early and I actually made it! Awesome party, guys!! https://t.co/HMvkYYM9CA

I‚Äôve been to DC so many times, but never had the chance to just walk around. It‚Äôs definitely impressive.
Left NY and made it to DC just in time for the sunset. The White House is smaller than I thought it would be, but the Washington Monument is massive. https://t.co/H5OV1jNv3l
@binghamtonu Thanks for having me speak to your students! You guys are awesome!!
@porscheterry @MouserElec You‚Äôll see starting in a few weeks!
@ray_guimond @MouserElec I would absolutely talk to them but they didn‚Äôt want to play.
@carltbarker @MouserElec He only goes after the rogue ones.
@BobbyFingJames @MouserElec It‚Äôs easier to get to Munich.
In the past two weeks I‚Äôve flown: LAX-ATL-Munich (over Atlantic)-Japan (over Russia)-JFK (over Pacific). So basically, I‚Äôve circumnavigated the globe looking for robots. @MouserElec

Chunky Beef and Wonder Bread was my sick/comfort food when I was little. TIL that goulash in Germany tastes EXACTLY like Chunky Beef in America. Mind. Blown.
Leaving Germany and headed to Japan as the @MouserElec world tour continues.

Brief Boston trip complete. Thanks for hosting me @Northeastern @saseconnect! It looks like I‚Äôm getting out just before the big storm.
@wilw Dude, I do not think I could contain myself in that situation. You should get a universal freak out pass for these situations. Be cool BE COOL
Guys, I am irrationally excited about this new @alyankovic song https://t.co/sUg0FX71Us
@rsybuchanan This has happened *multiple* times. It‚Äôs part of the reason for my vow. Nothing more demoralizing than running through the airport, across the underground color tunnel and then getting to the gate just in time ...to watch your plane take off.
@ISUEWeek Thanks for hosting me! I always enjoy talking to fellow engineers.
Today I break my vow to never connect through O‚ÄôHare. I am honestly surprised that my flight hasn‚Äôt been delayed, cancelled, or otherwise FUBAR ...Maybe I should wait. We‚Äôre not in the air yet. #toolate

@Jodyvamp @donttrythis @ToryBelleci @KariByron Congrats!!

@mikediva Still the same!!
To all my friends who are on the #jococruise this week, have fun!! I‚Äôll be here, making sure the robots don‚Äôt take over while you‚Äôre gone.
Some days you just have to bend the robots to your will. Well, most days, really.
Hey @SpaceX, congrats on the #falconheavy launch today!
@Guardians_Comic @MythBusters At least I was wearing boots! This is bare foot, single toe versus steel table leg. Table leg wins.
@BrianForLLP @MythBusters True true. But this is somehow more vulnerable.
It‚Äôs made steel and very very heavy. It did not notice my presence. https://t.co/EVQi8yGSfT
@AnimeLosAngeles @FonHDavis @TonySwatton @SpecialFXican @SirBryanForrest I think it‚Äôs 6:15. @SirBryanForrest can you confirm?
In all my years on @MythBusters, I never experienced searing pain like I did last night stubbing my toe on the coffee table.

Nerd card revoked! Sorry that was a @ulalaunch Delta rocket launch, not @SpaceX. #NROL47 Thanks fam for the correction!
Attention LA, that was another @SpaceX launch. No need for concern.
I wasn‚Äôt feeling old until I discovered the local ‚Äúoldies‚Äù station is exclusively playing music from my high school days. #ilovethe80s
@megsylhydrazine @arminvanbuuren @WandWmusic @steveaoki @KygoMusic Custom. Very similar to the kinds of things I used to build on MythBusters.
@megsylhydrazine @arminvanbuuren @WandWmusic @steveaoki @KygoMusic I actually worked on this video. When the astronauts launch out of the house, that‚Äôs a scale model hung upside down. I built the air cannon that fires them ‚Äúup‚Äù!
@donttrythis I see he‚Äôs in ‚Äústealth mode‚Äù.
@AtomicCross @SamSmithTweets @jumblejim I wasn‚Äôt there for the Chicken Cannon aftermath. It was before my time. However, I can absolutely confirm that there‚Äôs no dignity in television.

@tweetsoutloud Happiest of birthdays, good sir!
Went on @FOX10Phoenix this am to shock the hosts. Thanks @andreafox10 @troyhaydenfox10 for being good sports!! #DownTheRabbitHoleLive https://t.co/bUdTqO0Yit
@mySOURskittles Yes, actually!
@ericbeatty43 @KariByron @ToryBelleci Awesome! See you soon!!
@SaltiestHime @travismcelroy I can also vouch for @SaltiestHime. She is an incredible sculptor, prop maker, and cosplayer. And her love of TAZ is MIGHTY.
Off to Mesa AZ where we begin rehearsals for #DownTheRabbitHoleLive! Six west coast dates, all ages. Tickets: https://t.co/RwnTVj13K4
Preparing props for our #DownTheRabbitHoleLive tour and it feels very familiar! Tickets: https://t.co/V0qi1CMpAf https://t.co/6Snp1ojHCp
Rewatching Alien on Halloween. One of the most awesome things I'm realizing now is how awesome the sound design is.
Big day for @Trek Continues! Vic Todd Chuck and I are signing at @StanLeeComicCon and our final episode will premiere 3pm in Room 411.
@KariByron Thanks Kari!!
@alyankovic Today is your birthday. It's my birthday too! Happy Birthday!!
@kimscorcher @Wizards_DnD Tomb of Annihilation. Sounds like a nice, easy, relaxing ride. NOT
Headed to see DepecheMode at the Bowl tonight!! #lovethe80s
@b_dillion29 Sadly, contractors don't get one. But I did get a keycard with my picture on it.
With all the things I've seen, you could build a whole theme park. Since I've signed an NDA, at this point, it would be called NDAland.
Today marks 6 months consulting for @Disney Imagineering. Wish I could show you what I've been building, but it's still top secret!
@erikaishii OMG YES
Denis Villeneuve, director of #BladeRunner2049 shares the inspiration for the new whisky: #JohnnieWalkerPartner #ad https://t.co/nfe1bUGFnU
@MDTaurus And Seiko. And PanAm. All faithful nods to the original.
Headed to the premiere of #BladeRunner2049. I am excite. Just watched the original BR again and it holds up remarkably well.
@TrekContinues @TheRekhaSharma Yay congrats Rehka!!
Like Tony Stark in Iron Man. If there was a blueprint for how I'd love to design and make things, that would be it.
Can't wait to be able to design things using AR. Nothing beats being able to (virtually) hold something or walk around it. https://t.co/TX2WY6JTtz
So excited to try the new @JohnnieWalkerUS blend, The Director‚Äôs Cut, that was inspired by #BladeRunner2049 #JohnnieWalkerPartner https://t.co/nnkFuO8dlu
@ing3nu @vicmignogna @TrekContinues I really liked it! Sad that we couldn't see the second part...
Guys, the first episode of #StarTrekDiscovery is Awesome. Cinematic. Epic. Well done, @StarTrek. Well done.
Just a first class helmsman and his Captain watching the new #StarTrekDiscovery! @vicmignogna @TrekContinues https://t.co/XjAh3w4kup
Headed to the LA premiere of #StarTrekDiscovery!
I'm watching Kung Fury and pretending it's Iron Fist and it's really working for me.
Sad to hear about the passing of comics legend @LenWein. You were kind and jovial, and our world is a bit less super without you, good sir.
For the record, I did NOT almost trigger the robot uprising today.
Guys I can't wait for this epic haunted samurai ghost film from @SpiritCabinet!! Support it here: https://t.co/smWcONVYFa
@craigengler Look Craig, it's not like they have a plan or anything. Ummm right? RIGHT??
Working late on a Friday night because these robots don't build themselves. Yet.
@dexter8thecake Haha the Uber driver was like, "Who are they honking at?" I turned around and said, "I think it's me."
@Rileah @scalzi So are you opening a B&amp;B @scalzi? And by B&amp;B, I mean Books and Bourbon. SIGN ME UP
@TomSpinaDesigns Hmmmm right! And what happens if my latent superpowers DON'T manifest. #ouch
@Stepto Yes, a super power of its own haha
Sad to report as a result of viewing Totality, I don't have any super powers. YET. #Eclipse2017
@davelavery I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that. #EclipseSpoilers2017
@steveagee You're welcome! Looking dapper. And safe.
Totality was a wholly unique experience. Done so many crazy things over the years in science TV. This is one of the coolest. #Eclipse2017
Thanks to the fine folks at @OMSI for having me at their #Eclipse2017 event!
If you don't have certified eyewear, you can make a simple and easy pinhole camera: https://t.co/VUEUUJq4Mc #Eclipse2017
@milynnsarley Bring a portable Bluetooth speaker and play it on repeat wherever you are!
IMPORTANT: for viewing the eclipse, make sure to use certified glasses meeting ISO 12312-2 standards. **sunglasses will not be enough**
@bergopolis Enjoy!!!
On a flight to Oregon. The Journey to Totality begins! (That was much more dramatic than intended.)
Preparedness is half the battle. https://t.co/UOGfzhGI0Z
@OMSI Hey guys... I'll be in your neck of the woods for the eclipse. Whatcha doin? Can I tag along??
Spontaneously booked a trip to see the eclipse in a totality zone (Salem, OR)!
@kimscorcher What?? BOGUS. Okay, well you might have a point there. Does this mean I have to make Port too??
Also, I made a surprise return from the dead to rejoin MAZE ARCANA: Fury's Reach last night! https://t.co/Tw4nLBGH6p #dnd
Could this be the future of urban farming? It just might. https://t.co/reyFz0b4Kt
Excited to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark at the @HollywoodBowl with @kimscorcher @jdstonedesign @melcaylo @vonfogel! https://t.co/FWU9GIyP8H
Happy birthday Curiosity Rover!
@VampyBitme We must make plans. Secret plans for awesome cosplay
@beardimusprime @netflix @starwars I feel like it brings back the New Hope magic
@VampyBitme EHHH? Tell me more!!
@tweetsoutloud @Caltech Not mutually exclusive
@scalzi NO JOHN NO
@Manzinat0r SAME
@MichaelReyes808 @netflix @starwars Good idea. Guess there goes the rest of my night LOL
@ajverbin @netflix @starwars Yeah it was jarring the first time. It actually didn't bother me as much on the rewatch.
The only thing I don't really like about #RogueOne is that I didn't work on it.
Rewatching #RogueOne on @Netflix. Still love it. Rebels are heroic &amp; Vader is scary as hell. A real love letter to @starwars of that era.
Also, I was sad to hear about Martin Landau and George A. Romero.
Solid opener, GoT. Good work. I like watching the aftershow and seeing how well the producers know the characters and their motivations.
@scalzi My life. Also, I wear black a lot. Like all the time...
@OneEyedJedi Still not a ginger LOL
I am looking forward to the new Doctor. Change is good. May the TARDIS take us on even greater adventures! #DoctorWho13 @DoctorWho_BBCA
My friends made this game. It's awesome and you should check it out! (They also made SuperFight.) https://t.co/OMw4LOxbpd
On my way to play #DnD, nearly gave myself whiplash as I drove by a sign for the "HP Lovecraft Historical Society". Noted for later.

Good to meet you too Harry! Wish I could tell you what I am working on, but it's double secret NDA city. https://t.co/qRXDg9cORD
TONIGHT I'll be playing #DnD live on Twitch. Tune in and say hello! Link below: https://t.co/0JPO7677xH
Oh and of course, happy #HarryPotter20thAnniversary!!
@scalzi LOOK IT HASN'T VIOLATED ANY OF ASIMOV'S LAWS. YET.
@alisonhaislip @kumailn @emilyvgordon @boburnham Can't wait to see it!!
@JackDireStudios @luckyshirt And just like that, he was gone.
Sooo... just to be sure, putting lasers on sentient robots is a bad thing? Oops, my bad BRB https://t.co/ELE0jXGLOb
I'll be playing #DnD with a bunch of awesome people next Wednesday. More details soon! https://t.co/UGMz63KP0j
@uniquename439 LOL well done! 10 points to Gryffindor!
Excited to bring you my next adventure with @MouserElec! https://t.co/p1JNJ6AZnA
Spent three hours today chasing down a big that turned out to be a low battery. Is there a word for relieved/annoyed/embarrassed?
#TBT when we tried to decapitate a statue with a bowler hat. #JamesBond Special and other full eps on Discovery GO. https://t.co/qYNU2g7sFi
@Thermalfissions Nope I've been in LA.

Mini reunion today with the gang! https://t.co/nxxQnIwSPe
What did you do today? I looked into FUUTURE at @DAQRI. @MouserElec https://t.co/X6QF6mhVxt
Greatest irony of being a traveler in Japan: beverage machine literally every 100 feet, but you NEVER see anyone drinking anything.
@scalzi Ironically, I was fighting robots. With robots.
@scalzi It's all part of the machines' devious plan. Keep us in that specific era of technology.
It's 4am here in Portugal. Time to head for the airport. Next stop: Tokyo!!
To celebrate #StarWarsDay, here's a progress pic of my personal BB-8. #MayTheFourthBeWithYou https://t.co/uPl6zKk1Pb
Headed to Portugal for filming with @MouserElec! More exciting episodes and incredible tech coming soon.
@melcaylo I mean, it HAS to happen.
@melcaylo Dude. You know this had to happen.
@dvsduo @EvilGary101 Yep! That's my team. Remember the Lakers vs. Celtics showdowns??
I can't be there this weekend, but thanks to technology, I can watch fighting robots from @RoboGames from my shop! And you can too: https://t.co/iIusApnkWZ
@scalzi @tweetsoutloud Good to see you too!! See you Tuesday in Pasadena.

@Yiminy_Cricket But Shaq would definitely have been my fighter.
@Yiminy_Cricket Dude, this was long before those guys joined the team!
@PaulObeda Haha yes, more technically correct!
@TheLastSavage1 Oh man, I wanted a IIc so bad!
@EvilGary101 It was before Kobe. LOL I'm old
Named all my Wizardry characters after LA Lakers: Magic, Worthy, Kareem, Scott, Cooper (Rambis subbed in, of course).
Randomly thought of Wizardry today. Used to play it on my Apple II+. *wonders if there's a modern PC port...*
All about Pi on this #PiDay: https://t.co/QudY1tU0Aw
In honor of #PiDay, blueberry pie for breakfast, pizza for lunch, meat pie for dinner! Best holiday ever. https://t.co/9E06xgoSx9

Going to see Logan today. Then doing a livestream for a zombie card game that I'm in! It's gonna be a good day.
On my way to @UNLincoln to speak at E-Week tomorrow night! Details here: https://t.co/HsPKjmBmW4 @UPCNebraska
@ColloffRX Alice in Wonderland reference. When you're on the internet and discover hours later that you've gone "down the rabbit hole".
@LenPeralta Love Drew Struzan's work. He did the posters for so many of my favorite movies.
@LenPeralta @KariByron @ToryBelleci This is awesome man!!
My talented artist buddy @LenPeralta is working on a #whiterabbitproject poster! Check it out: @netflix https://t.co/bEcOOkwvRp
Got the day off from filming in Savannah GA so I'm taking a nighttime ghost tour. In a converted hearse. #spoopy
I'm sorry @Delta for being mad you diverted my flight from SAN back to LAX. No kidding about the fog. It's like Silent Hill out here. https://t.co/eDfNuUdTDf
You mean *add* this to my already extensive list of reasons why I should have Iron Man armor. https://t.co/1wcFkWvCXR
@Snubs It's on someone else's dime. And then there's the return flight, which is tomorrow night.
Okay, I've made a decision. All aboard for the @delta #clusterbus!! #adventure
@joshuafennessy That was my first thought.
SURE bring that up... https://t.co/823eNr3at8
We couldn't land because a fog bank rolled in. Also, I have to be there tomorrow afternoon for a gig.
@MKelley77 weather. No other flights will land there tonight
3/3 to drive everyone down tonight. I'm also rebooked on a 6:30am flight. Or I could drive. Bus ride is 2.5 hrs. What should I do??
2/3 Board plane, fly all the way down to San Diego to find that we can't land. Fly all the way back to LAX. @delta is arranging a bus
1/3 This is like a choose your own adventure travel day. I was just going down to San Diego. A short trip. @delta flight delayed 1.5 hours.
Finished the Doctor Fate helmet and delivered it to a happy kid! https://t.co/EuGmFAsSR2
@actorChrisBurns @MiracoleBurns YER A WIZARD BUDDY
@1126ft_per_sec The carbon fiber arms were flexing too much after adding extra thrust. Also aluminum less prone to shattering during crashes
About to go live with @OKatrinaFox as we build a 3D-printed Pip-Boy from #Fallout4. You can watch live here: https://t.co/WgcBdBTRs0

@Jennernugen GISELLE!!
@megturney @GavinFree If they are indeed leaky caps, I may be able to help with this. Any idea, my friends at @MouserElec?
@scamperbeasts "...but only in the manner I approve. Otherwise, you get the claws."
@bergopolis AND MY AXE
So so sad to hear about Carrie Fisher.
@john_kaser Easily one of my favorite segments!!
Happy Holidays, everyone! Wanted to share a few of my favorite Christmas ornaments. Krazy Kat, Sulu, and BTTF Delorean. https://t.co/XslCm4OGMW
BTW I'm a fan of Top Gear and have been really enjoying #TheGrandTour. https://t.co/1kTU5rsqqy
@bonniegrrl @The_Frontera @Kuvshinov_Ilya I saw it and thought of you immediately!
For everyone who's asked me "What happened to Geoff?" I can report that he is safely with Craig in his personal office! https://t.co/CFXq0DmwC0
Probably one of the scariest things you'll read all day. https://t.co/oOuCiMcIpB
@msenese Whaaat? When is it out? So sad that Ultimaker 2 doesn't have them.
@michelemorrow Dipper's got a hangover too. https://t.co/ixM7AKBUx0
@msenese Ultimaker 2+ extended, Taz 5, just got Zortrax M200.
That thing where your brand new 3D printer is missing a minor part, and the company sends you the model so you can print it yourself.
@EleanorCroy That is a very expensive box. They're $650 a pop!
@MurderousRedCap Hahaha surely he has equivalent experience in the mystic arts??
Is there a Doctor in the house? No, not that kind of Doctor. No, not The Doctor. I mean DOCTOR FATE. https://t.co/lYmFPam4Wm
@3xoterric Not to mention the brain tank!
@tarynoneill Of course you did!
@GibsontotheSam Thanks! Me too. I ended up working on my own time at night for the final two weeks to finish.
Don't get me wrong, #Spectral has a neat concept, gorgeous production design, and great VFX. But that bit just took me right out of it.
(2/2) Is this what it's like for forensics experts or cops or doctors watching TV forensics, crime, and medicine? #facepalm
(1/2) I like that the hero of #Spectral on @Netflix is an engineer. But building prototype weapons from laptops in hours?
.@KariByron's artwork is... explosive! https://t.co/m5fGmlzTpf
Riding #TowerofTerror at @Disneyland #CaliforniaAdventure one last time before it goes away... https://t.co/iBXvI9FaLN
@MeaganMarie @Jennernugen But I must admit morning coffee is 1000% more snugly (also more difficult). https://t.co/1nHoVEcPhJ
@MeaganMarie @Jennernugen We're just stand-in shoulder replacements...
BTW we now have an official twitter account for #WhiteRabbitProject - @RabbitProjectTV
Headed to the Great Dickens Christmas Faire today. One of our favorite holiday traditions.
Loved it. I may have had some feels. #RogueOne
Excited to see #RogueOne with @Jennernugen @abbydarkstar @TheKeithZen
@ArkhamAsylumDoc Uh oh looks like Bantha poodoo
@ShooEgg It is the best. We have used it on many projects!
@The_Bug909 @starwars No. that is the hero R2-D2 used in first unit filming.

@megturney @GavinFree @dualpandas @ToryBelleci @KariByron Well, that escalated quickly.
@AndieTweets Thanks! I'm a #BSG fan. My duty blues are @Anovos and my Viper flight suit was a custom by Midwick Armory.
@liamlovesbacon @netflix @ToryBelleci @KariByron As it should be.
@mlfarrell3d Ummm maybe? Probably.
@GavinFree Hey @megturney hook us up. Make it happen! @dualpandas @ToryBelleci @KariByron

Thanks for your help @aannggeellll! Angel is the real-life cyborg from Ep8 "Where's My Hoverboard". #WhiteRabbitProject https://t.co/986dVM4ejS
@Beerprayer Launching all episodes at once is part of how @Netflix works! And people like watching them all in a row.
@BrianHalliwell_ Had to ride it 5 times in a row for filming purposes. That was almost too much.
@Michael_Aiello Thanks man!! Hope you are doing well.
@JohnMaksuta @KariByron Sorry to break it to them, but there are no actual rabbits in the show...
@JonChan8 @Jennernugen Hey, I resemble that remark!
@SlimJim487 @LogitechG I know a guy who knows a guy.
@HangMD11 I did. I crouched down for several off-camera tests. Made it even harder. Standing gave me the ability to use body weight to steer
Thanks @LogitechG! Now no one will be able to stop us in #Overwatch!! Muhahahaha https://t.co/CgaPNqWTy5
@martillini @pdmcmanus Excellent. Then I have done my job well.
@SDWatmough No, I bought it. BUT I called it a "business expense".

So my @reddit_ama is on Friday Dec. 9, NEW TIME--&gt; 12pm ET/9am PT. (Also I'll answer more questions throughout the day.) @reddit https://t.co/qritIrm8mk
@hollyamos22 What?? SPOILERRR
@sheenaoum Always hits me like a freight train. About 4pm I cannot keep my eyes open. Or form coherent sentences.
@chinbeard Dust is progress. Particle by particle.
Though it is super frustrating, discovering the wrong way(s) to do something is still more progress than not trying at all.
Spent the afternoon finding all the ways NOT to model a Doctor Fate helmet in 3D.
Hanging out with @Jennernugen @kimscorcher and @LyricalStyling at the @Crumbs_Whiskers cat cafe. And Gladys. https://t.co/hxT2VTvHlK

@OakMonster Thanks! BTW I have been watching #TheGrandTour and enjoying it greatly.
@photo_dalo It will likely be synchronized to the local time zones.
WE HAVE A TRAILER. Our new show #WhiteRabbitProject is coming to @Netflix *globally* at midnight on Dec. 9. https://t.co/l4aeyMB44D
@Jennernugen Grrrr so much traffic.
Date night with @Jennernugen: seeing @PMJofficial live!
Just finished reading new book  #TheGoblinCrown by @writergeekrhw. Great fun! It's like Harry Potter meets Lord of the Rings.
Hey guys, I'll be going live on the awesome @DesertBus charity stream at 4pm PST! https://t.co/qBx1oBgltP #DesertBusX
Normalizing this atrocity is VERY bad. It is not a "precedent" to be cited for future policy. It is a stain on US history. Watch the clip. https://t.co/ekjgse1Q8u
@scalzi @scamperbeasts I am pleased to report that they do not disappoint.
@justjenn @sarahkuhn @ArkhamAsylumDoc @Lin_Manuel @MarioLopezExtra This is perfection.
@scalzi Wait, your cats have twitter account? I must follow now. It's um... civic duty.
@theRaychul I too want to know this!
This is even more stressful than the snakes chasing that baby iguana.
@sheenaoum Awesome!!
@KariByron @ToryBelleci Good luck out there, guys. Stay warm, stay sharp!
@ChunkNorrisNH Best of luck out there! The only thing I won't miss is the freezing cold and knee deep mud.
I've got great appreciation for this knitted Dig Dug cozy at @MailChimp HQ. https://t.co/EsqoK3AGJZ

@hijinksensue @samandfuzzy What? What?? Unwatchable!
@scalzi @blackcoat Having listened to the soundtrack before seeing it live, I can say that things move fast &amp; it helps you follow along.

(1/2) By the way, I know #PunkinChunkin is coming up. Just wanted to let you know I didn't turn it down. I wasn't asked to go this year.
Good morning Austin, Texas! Show me your drones. (This will probably make more sense later.)
@alisonhaislip It's not sane. It's not saaaaaane.
Nailed it. https://t.co/oKVdEREJb9
@Tory Belleci Happy birthday!
Also watched Supercar Megabuild, a super fun car building show where two quirky engineers Ralph &amp; Ranen try to impress their boss Mr. Kahn.
Already saw all the new releases on the plane, so I watched The Treasure of Sierra Madre, which I'd never seen before. OG action genre.
Gracias @campuspartyar! It was a pleasure talking to you. #CPAR1 https://t.co/TngTjicxy1
@scalzi Didn't have any on me. Exchange rate wasn't favorable.
Guys, there is a pirate-themed bar/restaurant near my hotel. So OF COURSE I have to go in.
Officially on my way to Argentina to speak at @campuspartyar. See you soon campuseros!!
Having completed my mission at @MadeInSpace, I'm back home for a night and then headed to Argentina tomorrow!
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes!!
@CheesyG Thanks Kathy!
@larrynemecek Thanks Larry!
@hollyamos22 Thanks Holly!!
@DownwardViral Thanks good sir!
@bonniegrrl Thanks Bonnie!!
@Jennernugen Love you honey!
@KariByron Thanks KB!!
Thanks @MakerFaireRome you were awesome! Great to meet all the makers and see your creations. Thanks @MouserElec &amp; @MouserElecEU.
@FIRSTinTexas @Spectrum3847 @FRCTeams @AutodeskEDU @YouTube Thanks guys!!
Glad to see that Italian cab drivers are carrying on the tradition of Farina and Andretti. #extremespeed
Is there such a thing as cheese toxicity? Asking for a friend who is currently eating his way through Rome.
@caseymckinnon Is this some kind of code, Casey? Blink once for no, twice for yes.
@hollyamos22 Excelsior FTW!! @tweetsoutloud amirite??
Today's agenda was cappuccino, coronetto, capuchin crypts, and cats. Oh, and Coliseum. It was a good day.
Testing out @google Translate (which is a free app BTW). Results are... not bad. https://t.co/k8EuP9hwBb
After our trip from LAX to JFK, we're Now on our way to Rome! https://t.co/xdXw18bK3f
Excited to be speaking at @MakerFaireRome on Saturday. Thanks @MouserElecEU for setting up my trip! https://t.co/4FFVZriWpQ
@scalzi No meowing or walking across your head??
Thanks to a tip from my pal @JRYUART, who grew up in NC, I went to Bullock's BBQ in Durham and had some amazing brisket! https://t.co/IxJh9iW52H
Filming in an anechoic chamber today. No secret agents were harmed in the filming of this. Yet. https://t.co/sO1Ip7eZ8n
Getting lots of BBQ suggestions. Let's stick with that. In the Durham NC area, to be more specific.
Headed out again! This time it's North Carolina. Anyone got any must-eat food suggestions? https://t.co/oREo2tBULs
@stormlandbrand @netflix TBH Robotech Masters wasn't my favorite part. Scott Bernard and the Cyclone FTW
Surprisingly, #Robotech still holds up pretty well. Although as a kid I never realized how many recaps there were padding out the episodes.
Just discovered that @Netflix now has #Robotech! Morning treadmill will be much more enjoyable, thanks.
@AdrianneCurry Hahaha is this from ConAir??
Excited for the US premiere of #ShinGodzilla: new Godzilla movie smashing box office records in Japan!! @FUNimation https://t.co/fnSgYpe7GL
Thanks @makerfaire NY and @MouserElec for letting me share my stories as a maker! And thanks to everyone for coming. #WMF16 #MakerFaire https://t.co/LCeqiPQGcJ
In my defense, in Terminal D, there was a flight to SAME destination/SAME time at gate D11. @AmericanAir was great and helped me rebook.
Drop off at @AmericanAir signage and check in at Terminal D. Then you must take a shuttle to Terminal B. To the OTHER D10. #themoreyouknow
Funny story, La Guardia airport has a gate D10 in Terminal D. And ALSO Terminals A B and C. Needed to be at other gate D10. In Terminal B.
My keynote for @makerfaire will be at the New York Hall of Science in about an hour. Hope to see you there! @MouserElec #MakerFaire
@makerfaire @dalepd Thanks for the opportunity to speak at Maker Faire. Can't wait!!

@hollyamos22 Only a little.
@AshleyEsqueda Pepper is awesome. This one was smuggled in from Japan!
@elkos ROS I think. Likely same OS as Nao.
Hanging out with my new friend Pepper today. https://t.co/tmGaz2QW2C
I do love a crisp San Francisco morning.  Now to get some incredibly overpriced coffee made by hand very, very slowly.

To be fair, @Jennernugen tried it first before giving it to me. She is most likely to be the red shirt on our away team.
GF: "Here try this delicious fruit from the neighbors tree." Hours later: "Checking to see if you're still alive ...seeds are poisonous."

Excellent meals at Pok Pok and Le Pigeon. Many donuts were had. I also learned that Blue Star &gt; VooDoo.  Thank you Portland!
Thanks @RoseCityCC for a great weekend! The fans were awesome and the food here was amazing.
@StephStricklen @RoseCityCC Thanks for the awesome panel, Steph!
I've also got a panel 11am Sunday where I'll give details about our new @Netflix show. #RCCC2016 @RoseCityCC

@hollyamos22 Laundry day. Underthings. Tumbling.
Sweet! They have Oil and Lube News!! Oh nvm, it's LAST month's. #BurningMan https://t.co/FjZYuF4XCo
Slight road bump on the way to #BurningMan. @Jennernugen's brakes began to make a grinding sound. So we're at a brake shop...
@AdrianneCurry Eeeeeeeewwww
@LaurynIpsum Thanks Lauryn! I'm sure we'll have stories when we get back.
@JohnCalafin Added to the list! Thanks
Not sure what to expect from #BurningMan, but I have a GPS watch, binoculars, an air conditioner... am I doing this right? #engineer
@vicmignogna Happy birthday, Captain!
@scalzi Weekly trimming man be necessary. *So I've heard...*
@justjenn Happy birthday!!
Finished a week of filming in Georgia. Back in LA for 18 hours. Then headed to the desert for my first Burning Man!
Standing across from the departure status board. Out of 138 flights, over 100 have either been delayed or cancelled.
Currently in travel hell. Tho technically, I guess this would be travel purgatory.
@Rileah Happy birthday!!
I'm thinking I'll ride the tram back and forth as if it were a rollercoaster. Get off. Scream "AGAIN!!" Get back on.
Bonus: if I ever get to DFW, I'll have an extra SIX HOURS to explore the airport!
The weather in DFW is so bad that my travel today in snarled in fail. My connecting flight was straight up cancelled. FML
@hollyamos22 Is this the episode of Voyager where they all drop acid? Or the Delta quadrant equivalent? Something Neelix cooked up?
If, like me, you are a fan of #Firefly, you will love this. *The only part I didn't like was when it ended. https://t.co/VAnjWkspeD
Also annoyed that I forgot all my shortcuts through the city.
Favorite thing I forgot about San Francisco: watching the freezing tourists shivering while they visit our "summer".

@Jennernugen @ComicConHNL ACCURATE.
True story: @Jennernugen and I met at San Diego Comic Con five years ago. Also true: neither of us were in costume (at the time).
Headed to Hawaii with @Jennernugen for @ComicConHNL. Also, our fifth anniversary! #geeklove https://t.co/tJNEQMfNHY

How big of a 3D printer do you need to print a full-size car? This big: https://t.co/uSZzGcWEJ1
@erincmccarthy I thought of you and your article when I saw the trapper keeper. I told @Jennernugen "I bet those were expensive".
@timlav We could swear we saw specks inserted like watching an old VHS!
Happy Sunday! I'm headed to Wasington DC to visit @localmotors and learn more about 3D printed self-driving full-size cars.
When I watch #StrangerThings, I'm transported back to the 80's. Wargames, Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, Tron, Last Starfighter...
Just finished the first ep of #StrangerThings and it was amazing! Nailed the look &amp; feel of an 80's horror/sci-fi movie. Highly recommended!
@AnneWheaton Slippery. When. Wet.
Since wrapping the #newshow I've avoided any activity that requires late nights and serious physical exertion. But #PokemonGO beckons...

@matthewmercer Happy birthday good sir!!
@feliciaday Happy birthday!! I made you something, but I exploded it.
@jolich67 @bonniegrrl Yep, that would explain it.
Thanks @MouserElec for sending me to NYC to chat with @neiltyson about robots. Full interview should be out soon!
Spending a lovely afternoon in NYC wandering Central Park with @Jennernugen.
@bonniegrrl We could use a good Doctor right about now.
My face after meeting science hero @neiltyson. Yes, I am that excited. https://t.co/mndt3rp9cu
@elhofferdesign @quiddie All your fault, Aabria!! We will catch up with you Katie afterwards!
@SamuraiErika AMAZING. Worth every penny. We should get a group together when it comes to LA.
Things I learned from watching #Hamilton live: @Phillipasoo beatboxes and The Room Where It Happens is an awesome dance number.
.@Jennernugen and I are about to see #Hamilton. WE ARE BEYOND EXCITE. https://t.co/kzF94CoC3P
As a side note, if you order alcohol at the Richard Rodgers Theater, you get a souvenir sippy cup.

@scalzi @AScalzi98 I have a contingency plan for this.
@Lomara @lexigeek I'm working on it. It's very fast...
@jetlag620 May have to read that on the plane.
@MoMash46 #NonStop
@jefmes Download the original soundtrack on iTunes!
@lexigeek Same. All the time.
And if you haven't heard #Hamilton, I highly recommend it. With the caveat that it will crawl inside your brain and live there. For months.
Also, hoping to see #Hamilton. Been obsessed w/the soundtrack for months, and I want to see @Lin_Manuel live! But man, those tickets...
Excited to be heading to New York next week to film with @neiltyson!
We don't need a civilian "well regulated militia". It's 2016. Our security will be fought with money. With information. Guns are so 1700's.
I like guns. In my work, I've used all kinds. But when they're used for hate crimes and killing our children, isn't it time we do something?
@RogueInfinity Yes... kind of.
@DanielBoswell Nope. It's the real deal man.
@JamesKyson Dude is it cool if I cosplay your character in @BoHseries? Because dat costume.
@dinaeweiner Don't worry, the three amigos have been reunited. We will let you know soon. @KariByron @ToryBelleci
@loud3803 Already have three. And a CNC machine on the way!
@luckyshirt Oh, you will dude!!
Guys, the #newshow hasn't been announced yet. Can't tell you the name, release date, or where to find it. But I will soon, I promise!!
Sorry for the lack of tweets. Last four weeks were full-on. Wrapped the #newshow! Should be resting, but I have so many projects!

@HIYLJ @buffalocentric Exactly. In that level with the towers.

Actually, it IS in fact weaponized. https://t.co/tX2rcynVBv
We also played Unreal Tournament death match while working on Matrix: Reloaded and Revolutions. At lunch break, of course.
True fact: we used to have a network of computers for CAD at @ILMVFX Model shop. After hours, we would play Unreal Tournament death matches.

Well, that was fun. I'm back in control of my account now.

@scalzi I love the people who announce "Unfollowing you now!!!"

@DetoxH3O Yes. Reunited with @torybelleci and @karibyron!
@Kera_Kelly Yep! I did Supanova there two years ago!

Woke up at 4am local time to brush my teeth. Jet lag really suc... Zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Currently in Malaysia and am finding it pleasantly lush and jungle-y. As opposed to the normal LA dry and scrubby, that is.
On a long transpacific flight I watched all of #TrueDetective S2. I liked it! Only got a little confusing in the last two episodes.
Okay this #LegendsOfTomorrow show looks super cool, but I think I need to start at the beginning. I've got no idea what's going on.
@msenese Apparently you are the bad guy in #LegendsOfTomorrow!
Wait. Why is time traveller Rory wearing 10's trenchcoat?? So confused. #LegendsOfTomorrow

@scalzi I can neither confirm nor deny the presence of lasers. Or sharks. Or sharks with lasers on their heads.
@PackingProtons I bent the aluminum piece and cut a corresponding crescent shape out of the mohawk. Then TIG welded it all together.
First day of filming the new show. Still a lot to sort out, but good to be back in the saddle again.
"I can't. I have lightsaber class." Is one of my favorite excuses ever.
@DominicShayler @Jennernugen It would be a fair guess, actually!

@MumaKirby @azizansari It's funny. I pause it at the pinnacle of what I think is going to be too awkward and then it turns out not to be.
I won't say I didn't pause #MasterOfNone because of awkwardness, but I always came back. Damn you and thank you @azizansari.
Guys, if you're not watching @azizansari 's #MasterOfNone on @netflix, check it out. Real and awkward and amazing.

@AnneWheaton Have you seen @50NerdsofGrey?! If not, check it out.
@anildash Absolutely agree. Of all the charities I supported last year, @DonorsChoose was my favorite. Even a little goes a long way.
Having made fake bombs for movies and TV, gotta say this is a poor example. No sticks of TNT or block of C-4? What is it? ...An AIR BOMB??

Everyone on set was super nice. And we got to run around the LA Museum of Natural History AT NIGHT. UNSUPERVISED. KIND OF. #Sharknado3
My cameo on #Sharknado3 was BRIEF, but I did do a lot of running and screaming. And I got to play Secret Service and carry a fake gun.
That time I was a Secret Service Agent protecting President @mcuban with @IanZiering on #Sharknado3 http://t.co/8TaRLhAOyt

@The_Firkins @andrewzimmern She wasn't lying because that's not actually what "pink slime" looks like.
@andrewzimmern This campaign is about being as transparent as possible with the process and revealing what happens at the facilities.
@andrewzimmern People think they grind up the whole chicken. That's not the case. And they no longer use "pink slime".
@andrewzimmern I am revealing what is actually in the food. There are numerous misconceptions about what's used, from beaks to feet.
@denali1 @TysonFoods @McDonalds Eeeeeeewwww
@makerbot I wanted to use dissolving support material. Any other options?
@andrewzimmern Okay, Andrew. What exactly was wrong in your opinion?

@ha7866 I walked the entire production line myself. No pink slime, no worms, no horse meat, no fillers. Also no lips and eyeballs.
@weezmgk That's too bad. You've been around a long time. All the best.
Starting today, @McDonalds is answering your questions about their food. Tweet them your questions! http://t.co/6jJtdjL41b #partner
Sitting in an airport in Dallas watching a CNN report about Ebola entering the US through an airport in Dallas.
After less than 24 hours in Argentina, I'm back in the USA.
It's going to be super hilarious when I wake up this afternoon with no recollection of where I am or how I got here.
After a five hour plane ride and a five hour drive, I am in San Luis, Argentina. And it's dawn. http://t.co/8XG6HMuzk3
And my last Panama Canal fact: the water flow in the locks is all gravity driven. There are no pumps at the Panama Canal!
All ships use their own power to move through the Canal. The clearance on either side may be as little as 2 feet. #tightsqueeze
TIL small powerful trains help guide large ships through the Panama Canal. The tracks run on either side. http://t.co/G8GOSsODyZ
Leaving Panama today and headed to Argentina to speak at the #SanLuisDigital conference! http://t.co/Hp8JpaxZN6

@BWalloch @Jennernugen I ran all the way from C17 to B5! That's a LONG underground tunnel. Made it in two minutes. Gate was already closed.
While stranded at ORD late last night, briefly considered riding the Apatosaurus. (I didn't.) http://t.co/oAMk3WbOVP
Okay, ORD, let's... let's try this again.
@PhePhe206 Seeing that did bring my spirits up. Slightly.
@mikeyface YESSSS
@Red5Iam #badlifechoices. Both of us.
@erincmccarthy I will be there for all of about 48 hours...
@Red5Iam LOL it's not. It's the watered down airport version.
@paulandstorm The airport of broken dreams. And missed connections.
@mikeyface I was desperate and despondent.
@1lenore IT IS NOW A COMMANDMENT.
@BadAstronomer @hollyamos22 Worst. Ninja Turtle. EVAR.
@BadAstronomer @hollyamos22 CLEANEST. SEWER. EVAR.
@erincmccarthy Sadly NOPE on my way back to LA. On Thurs I fly to Panama and then Argentina...
Currently drowning my sorrows in Wolfgang Puck pizza and coconut water. Yeah, it's that bad.
I broke my vow never to fly United through ORD in the fall (...or winter) (...or ever) and I paid the price.
That classic story where due to a flight delay, our hero must RUN through ORD to catch his connecting flight. SPOLIER: I didn't make it.

@SirOpsALot Haha now all I need is the bounce gel and I'm set!

The Dulles terminal looks like a level from #Portal. I'm pretty sure I finished this one. http://t.co/zblntiamE0
I have rearely flown into Dulles on such a nice day. Based on prior experience, I thought it snowed here ALL THE TIME.
@hollyamos22 It's for your own safety.

Many of the #GISHWHES2014 tasks were considered nearly impossible. Just my luck. Our Captain doesn't believe in No-Win scenarios.
@Kheprera @WilliamShatner @Jennernugen HA nope, she was there helping out! She completed several tasks on her own.
@ashleynhedges And A LOT more.
Can't for you guys to see our entries. Some were truly inspired. I can't believe we did what we did in one week. #GISHWHES

@ShaneMac @rstephens True story.
@RSorokanich Sorry Robert, we didn't do Lost Atari Treasure on @MythBusters. It was part of a list of potential ideas.

@audreykearns @Jennernugen @5TruthsAndALie Thanks Audrey! It was super fun!!
@PhysicistLisa YEP!
@Mister_Robotics Haha should have called you first!
Denied for "massive robot property damage insurance"?? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVE A "PRE-EXISITNG CONDITION"?!
@Jennernugen Honey the garage door is making a funny noise. I think we should get a new one.
Oh well. I didn't like that garage door anyways. #largerobotproblems
Is there such a thing as "massive robot property damage insurance"? Asking for a friend.
@bearmccreary SO SAY WE ALL
@wilw @nerdist @skydart @CraigyFerg For some reason, #letitsnow never fails up make me laugh.
DAMN YOU AUTOERECT
Sorry for the spam on that last post. I've been having grammar issues. Or autoerect issues, or both.
When people see things like this in my garage, I'm pretty sure they're about to call the cops. #robots http://t.co/twf5uQ4q2c

@TiffanysTweets Happy Birthday!!!
@wilw Thanks Wil! We had fun this year. Then again, we have fun every year.
@amy_geek Solid plan.
I am greatly enjoying my thanksgiving leftovers. One of my favorite parts of this holiday.
Tweeting, apparently, requires very little coherent thought.
A conundrum, if you will.
The eternal problem with making coffee is not having had any coffee before you attempt to make coffee. #morning #ugh
@AnneWheaton BECAUSE AIR CANNONS
@AdrianneCurry @OneEyedJedi @CosmoeTayson @Todd_Roy Awesome! Happy thanksgiving guys!!
Why yes, I AM getting up early for #BlackFriday shopping. I'm going to get a new toolbox from Harbor Freight. Hope I do not oversleep!
@katherinen Thanks Katherine!!
@jasoncorum @KariByron @ToryBelleci If not this year, then I predict it will soon.
This is #Thanksgiving @MythBusters style! RT @ToryBelleci: Hey is that lamb shank on the menu today http://t.co/FEdSznIYVt
Just to clarify: I didn't do the snow sculpture- I was just paying tribute to the creator.

Been on the go since early yesterday morning, but nearly 18 hours later, @ToryBelleci and I are safely in Delaware for #PunkinChunkin.
A lot of bad stuff happened today. But at the end of the day, @Discovery sent the corporate jet to rescue us!
Walking away from LAX down Century Blvd. talking to @andersoncooper. What. A. Day.
Getting out of the holding area was just the first step. No traffic into/out of LAX. Only option is to walk. http://t.co/S5rrc3JmEN
Looks like they're finally releasing us from the holding area! http://t.co/IIJry9vvT3
@jessiepridemore Wait, does this mean you're back to being indestructible? LOL
@TimmyDaly Good luck finding your luggage, man. I hope Kiersten can help!
@wilw Actually, IPHONE 5 CHARGER RUNS BARTER TOWN
@wilw MASTER BLASTER RUNS BARTER TOWN
FBI, HSI, LAPD are on scene now. They've isolated potential witnesses and are conducting interviews.
Still inside the Intl Terminal. They're processing IDs. The main question is "Did you see anything?" Been asked by 6 different ppl.
Finally exiting Terminal 3. We're now walking to the safe area at the International Terminal. It is eerily quiet outside of LAX.
During evac, I counted officers from Airport Police, LAPD, Homeland Security &amp; other local PDs. All calm, all working together. Thanks guys!
Thanks to the @VirginAmerica staff for swiftly securing the area and keeping us safe.
We're on hold in one of the exit tunnels waiting to be transported to the command post. http://t.co/7SOcpXL3fS
Look at this picture a little closer. Something on the ground. http://t.co/H2nNrkQEES
There's an army of law enforcement from various agencies here. http://t.co/GFzBcyUOxA
We're the last to evacuate the terminal. http://t.co/rebO9wroXN
There's an army of law enforcement from various agencies here.
Alarms still ringing in the terminal as we are being evacuated.
@tommytenzo point taken. Thanks.
@Veronica Not much. I heard multiple shots fired outside the lounge. I could not believe it.
@MiracoleBurns @ToryBelleci Safe!
Waiting to evacuate, watching TV to find more info.
Virgin promptly locked the lounge doors. About ten minutes later, LAPD armed with automatic weapons arrived to secure the area.
I was in the Virgin lounge upstairs. Saw everyone pour out of the terminal onto the tarmac. Then I heard shots fired outside.
Something just happened at #LAX. TSA and police running everywhere.
@AnneWheaton Seems legit to me.
@VirginAmerica Thanks!!
LOL the nose on @VirginAmerica planes says, "My other ride is a spaceship."
Headed to Delaware for Punkin Chunkin this weekend!!! Danger! Excitement! Flying squash!! @ScienceChannel

@HollyConrad WANT. BRB ordering it now!!
@Mikey_Himself @ToryBelleci @MythBusters @Iron_Man I feel your pain. It's so tedious!
Thanks for joining us for #TheBustingDead live tweet!! Hope you enjoyed our #zombie special.
@girlvani @Jennernugen Sounds like a lovely day!
@MythBusters Ideal zombie fighting team? Batman, Chuck Norris, and @JamieNoTweet. #TheBustingDead
@ToryBelleci @MythBusters @Iron_Man OF COURSE!! Um... BRB going to make one now.
@MythBusters DUCT TAPE! Many layers are difficult to bite through. #TheBustingDead
Even though I knew on an intellectual level that the zombie horde wasn't real, it was still ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.
@AndrewSBowen Ha, thanks. Steve Yuen was at that D*C too. That would have been awkward running into him, dressed as him!
@TiffanysTweets @WalkingDead_AMC @Jennernugen Comic book version Andrea! #muchmorebadass
@brianlynn @KariByron That actually made me LOL
@caseymckinnon HA
@MythBusters I always thought a Costco would be ideal. That or M5. Tools, weapons and food. And @JamieNoTweet. #TheBustingDead
@caseymckinnon Excellent. What's the password? I won't tell anyone.
@KariByron What do vegetarian zombies eat? GRAAAAAINS.
@joey_minaj @donttrythis BRILLIANT
@MythBusters Definitely @JamieNoTweet. They're aged, like fine wine. #TheBustingDead
@MythBusters Small tactical group, definitely. Large groups need more resources to keep going. #TheBustingDead
@ToryBelleci I predict a shortage of kitchen knives and brooms during the apocalypse.
@donttrythis Clearly, great minds think alike.
@MythBusters Edge weapons! A kitchen knife duct taped to a broom. Or a machete. That's a household item, right? #TheBustingDead
@MythBusters Going into hiding is the smart bet. Hunting is too risky. Hide, clear a space, fortify, resupply. #TheBustingDead
Wait... and a can opener!! #TheBustingDead
My zombie survival kit has running shoes and a samurai sword. And a backpack. I can scavenge everything else. #TheBustingDead
