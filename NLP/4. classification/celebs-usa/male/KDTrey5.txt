@Bmaggia you're just upset. I get it lol. I love you too
@CKiepert I bring out the ya mama jokes on occasion. Be on the look out
@Bmaggia scenario: u tell a joke on me, I laugh, I make a joke about u, u call me soft?? 🤔🤔 makes zero sense to me. Who's the soft one?
@incarceratedbob @Stugotz790 same man that uses amazon instead of going to the mall. Lmao
@Mohsin_35_313 thanks bro!!
@Smailing07 @OGZaves didn't know I played golf
@OGZaves I now play for every team in every league. Mission accomplished! Winning rings every year until I retire
@zoolander8816 I don't get this one. I think u mean Atlanta or to be even funnier, the patriots 🗣 HA
@deusoc17 so you're tellin me what I was thinking?
@thehappydaze u said 81 and I gave u somebody else that didn't have 81 and u backtracking. Think before u tweet me lol
@waldorfsfinest everyday, I don't think about if we are gonna win or lose a game. Every single day I think about my individual skills tho
@waldorfsfinest I play for more than one reason. If anybody tell u they don't then it's just a lie
@waldorfsfinest a coach is suppose to put me in position to maximize what i do best. That's why more than one person wins a ring.
@waldorfsfinest i play to be the best individual talent I can be, that's why u work out by yourself.
@Jason_Stateman it is.
@thehappydaze mj?
@channooo3 thank u lol
@waldorfsfinest if u do the eye test, u would know that mac was different.
@waldorfsfinest t mac could do it all. Don't get it twisted. He was booked in for 30-6-5 every night. Nobody could stop him bro lol
@waldorfsfinest I'm on here arguing about TMac. What has the world come to, guess he's not the "two way player" u want.
@waldorfsfinest u don't know basketball so you don't get it
@waldorfsfinest he played with mutumbo when he was the oldest player in the league and grant hill got hurt a few times, so did Yao!
@waldorfsfinest he got traded for franchise. Know your history
@waldorfsfinest oh yea I know that
@waldorfsfinest it's always been about winning. U get more buckets than the other team and u win
@waldorfsfinest I don't get what u tryna say.
@waldorfsfinest u like assist and rebounds right? U make a pass so that u can score right? U rebound an attempted shot right?
@waldorfsfinest elaborate
@blazeisbaseball he wore number 1 on his jersey
The game will always be about buckets. When it comes to buckets, there was nobody like T-Mac. FOH, number 1 in the HOF. Respect OG
🗣HA
@ZachFozz yooo that shit was crazy, right? Still honored til this day
@LiamNBA John fast as shit so he stop on the dime and it's over. I can't do that, I got the mini snatch lol
@Benny_Powers Bernie sanders
@Terrance623 CJ McCollum dropped me off reaaaalll smooth this year. I had to pay homage lol
@RipCityGoon haaa man that snatch back was viscous 😂😂
Touched earth https://t.co/4bUpdJG8G5
@CallMeShayy_ dope! Thank u
Good luck tonight, my good men! Bring it home https://t.co/VaYIfl3dts
@KingMike210 every Saturday. We still talk about those stories today
@nickswish8 @NekiasNBA I feel positive about myself when I respond to "negative" shit lol
@BarstoolRDT you right, I apologize.
@BarstoolRDT you can throw jokes and it's fun but when I do it I'm in my feelings? It don't work like that bro. U don't have that much power
@JimWhite67 hahaha love ya man
@__ballas__ that boy gotta sneak away from his parent to kiss his girl in the bathroom. I remember bro, respect 💯
@JustinEvans05 you bypass everything else I said when I made that statement which was made like last year probably. U aren't better at this
@JustinEvans05 u pick and choose what u wanna see. That's your problem
@JustinEvans05 that's exactly why I will win hahaha
@JustinEvans05 yea u don't have knowledge. I won already
@TyroneSpikes @BarstoolRDT you both have other men in your profile pics.
@BarstoolRDT no asshole, you aren't good enough.
@JustinEvans05 bro I think about ball in my sleep. U can't mess with me son
@BarstoolRDT I don't know u so I don't have a better response.
@BarstoolRDT your mother
@dmduberstein I said basketball tough guy
ICYMI: My @YouTube Live LA experience w/@FirstWeFeast, @swooz1e, @WhatsInside, #RyanToysReview: https://t.co/fjiCtpk77N
@PocketChange300 haha yea man. It's pretty funny
@HitmanHolla lucky shot
@HitmanHolla no chance u scoring on me
@RipCityGoon 😂😂😂
@RipCityGoon nah son, we doing this in person. We watching film and everything. U will be a Nba coach when we done lmao
@RipCityGoon you don't know more ball than me. Bring ya friends too
@RipCityGoon you will not beat me in a Nba debate. Set it up, face to face chump
@Silent__C @RipCityGoon @RaeJohnsonNBA he's probably driving his Lambo to the gym to work on his game. Lol
@RipCityGoon the starving animal in the court is most dangerous. All that other moral, upbringing shit doesn't matter.
@RaeJohnsonNBA u make no sense. If he wants to hoop then he knows failure is a part of it.
@Silent__C @RipCityGoon @RaeJohnsonNBA I never starved, I ain't kno I was poor until I made money. I played cuz it was fun.
@RaeJohnsonNBA so u think the only reason he wants to make it to the league is to get a Lambo. He ain't u dawg. He prolly likes to hoop
@10milekid I was lurkin round his block, he was lurkin on my twitter
@RaeJohnsonNBA I don't even get what you mean
@canadian_boy11 @Lazy3_ @RaeJohnsonNBA ok so tell me what his career is gonna be like if it's guaranteed?
@RaeJohnsonNBA no, it wouldn't Push YOU to be great. Speak for yourself, not him. U don't know that man lol
@Lazy3_ @RaeJohnsonNBA he ain't making the league cuz his name. He gonna make it cuz he nice.
@RaeJohnsonNBA that's not true. Maybe He's not playing basketball to get "things"
@Sonnnnnnnnnnnny @RaeJohnsonNBA I'm crying 😂😂😂
@RaeJohnsonNBA you don't have to struggle growing up to be a good basketball player.
@RaeJohnsonNBA aww u want a Lambo too?
Young Melo with the Lambo. Stop playin wit shorty, he really out here.
@RipCityGoon hell yea he did.
@rawan_sger when 2k comes out I'm gonna set the league up. It's gonna be dope
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke bro I'm just tellin u to watch games. Stop looking at stats, u will learn a lot watching
@ParkerHanft just arguing over basketball. Something I'll probably do for the rest of my life 🤷🏾‍♂️
@Abdiqalis yes it does and vice versa but I'm not even the court in this pic lol
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke so as soon as steph walks across he gets double teamed?
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke lol u got it big homie lol
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke ok
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke they do NOT get doubled team. You got watch the games when they are on, not twitter lol
@Legend_Today much love bro
@HatcherSeth I get it, you're hurt on a personal level, sorry. But we are talking about the actual game. Wrong convo for u lol
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke why would I want to play basketball against 2 people? Why should they have an advantage?
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke pick and rolls causes 2 guys to guard the ball. Steph plays in Pick and roll a lot
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke so u saying I'm too good to get played one on one? I need a double team every play?
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke nope that was just bad transition defense. Not strategy
@KDTrey5 @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke and its 9.6 seconds left in the half. Most teams trap in pick and roll that late
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke matter fact, I'm not even in the game. Maybe the reason steph was trapped harder
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke issa pick and roll. He only got trapped cuz it was a screen. And do u see me wide open?
@SK6Stan nah my narratives don't fit.
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke you're tellin me? Lol
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke I see y'all arguing, just wanted to give some insight into the game! 💯
@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke nobody got double teamed the whole series. Pick and rolls is 2 on 2 defense, not traps
@BrandoX_FSU no charge
@ThaRealRicci Tell them stop asking me questions all the damn time
Shoutout Guwop for the inspiration, I see the growth big dog. I don't know why I tweeted this but it was on my mind. 💯

Y'all ain't F'n with Joyner Lucas. Don't @ me
@LiamNBA shhh

@RealJayWilliams that video of him coachin up that young Melo after the game was incredible. I kno a lot of my friends had coaches like him
@RealJayWilliams jay u kno all of us as youngins growing up had coaches that would spazz out every once and a while. It taught us passion
@just2eazy how much did I pay for it?
@CashNastyGaming mood https://t.co/19WQNs6xYr
@PFTCommenter oh word? He told u that?
@justincohan2 so I should be grateful to be so lucky to be randomly chosen out of billions to be a member of the Nba champs?  🗣 HA
@waldorfsfinest impact is based off what a team needs from u to win. If his team needs u to average 30 to win than u should lock in on that
@waldorfsfinest I'm talking purely, one on one can u stop what I got in my bag. Kyrie got the supreme product in his lol 🤷🏾‍♂️
@KelsoBall you must be a piece of 💩 if a dog chooses to live in the streets instead of your house
@waldorfsfinest see, I don't agree him bring more skilled
@waldorfsfinest yes
@waldorfsfinest i can't look at 2k ratings when I'm comparing players, i like the eye test. Sorry
@waldorfsfinest I said skilled wise I got kyrie, y'all say intangibles you pick iverson. I feel u, we came to a middle ground. Both tough
@AliOop15 what the babies gon do?
@TyeGotThatEdge nope, not Fallin for that one
@JumpmanJordan @waldorfsfinest which one are u talking to?

@mynameis_kaylee so do u have any friends? Twitter followers don't count, ok?

@mynameis_kaylee aight stop playing around. U know We don't know each other, how can u tell me how I am. Another lie smh
@mynameis_kaylee I know u didn't say that because u can't hoop but you are lying about the other stuff

You want to show people how funny you are because you're too insecure to do it in person? I know that's why posted in the past.
You want a voice? You wanna be more popular?

.@dunkindurantx We will see, I just want you to be inspired
.@nikefirezach Just knowing they were capturing a real inside look at who I am. A lot of people may get it confused looking in from outside
.@zachjb5 The work I put in on and off the court and my personality as a growing young man
.@adriabacuevitas Well for me the last 7 years was watching the NBA champion hold up the Larry O'brien trophy
.@zachdee97 Yep all the time. Everything we do its competitive. I always win too
.@sthomas141 2 hours a day.
.@Ryan_Eller I’m a closed off person around new crowds so having them there was different, I warmed up pretty quick though
.@ReeSpendz Not being on a schedule,  you have to be disciplined enough to get your work in

@bmoe_careful he didn't catch a pass after that td

@waldorfsfinest we not talking about teams we talking about the player. That Phoenix team was nothing before Nash got there btw
@DntBeGoodBeDave why not?
@waldorfsfinest they played the game in different ways but both impacted it at a high level. Get what I'm saying?
@bmoe_careful u saying AI because of what he did to the culture and society as a whole, his impact was much bigger
@bmoe_careful u can't tho. ai was a scorer, steve Nash a pure pg so they go about the game and approach it different ways
@bmoe_careful can't compare the 2. Different players
My homeboy @Logic301 doing it for Maryland. Album is 🔥 , go cop it
@PATisDOPE dej loaf, thugger, jay elec, and some 90s hip hop and R&amp;B
@PATisDOPE his concepts are tight and his style is different. Voice just sounds the same
@PATisDOPE I disagree bro
@waldorfsfinest u can't bro. Harsh reality
@waldorfsfinest @bmoe_careful @vettepassby35 u guys think yall can play in the L?

@BigAlKnows @GoBullsFan @waldorfsfinest I'm not saying we all grew up the same but it's all the same area yes
@BigAlKnows @GoBullsFan @waldorfsfinest what's the misconception?
@GoBullsFan @BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest once u live so far from home that u can't drive you'll take pride.
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest they aren't as close as we are. Cmon now
@BigAlKnows kings dominion is farther out I'm talking northern va
@BigAlKnows hell yea. I knew that I could catch the train there so it was close enough to call it part of the area
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest @nishant_123456 you'll take more pride when u live outside the area and come back to where u were born to visit
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest @nishant_123456 va was the good part of town. Every lil city has a suburb part. We still claim them
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest does it really matter when u think about it?
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest I grew up different from ty Lawson. We ain't live the same but he apart of us
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest well in the basketball community we all try to stay together no matter if it's dc, md or va.
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest why is it bogus though?
@BigAlKnows @waldorfsfinest what that gotta do with anything
@waldorfsfinest we hate each other that's why not too many people make it out of this area
@waldorfsfinest that's sad.
@waldorfsfinest it's all the same cuz
Jeter on why he is retiring: "I still feel as though I could play, I just don’t want to.''"...Perfect answer. RE2PECT
