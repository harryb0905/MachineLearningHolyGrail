@OpenSociety @Release_drugs A6.  I want everyone in the UK to go and take their friends and family to #DrugPolicyMuseum on Nov. 3-5. It will open your hearts + minds.
@OpenSociety A6. We need to follow the lead of organizations like @Release_Drugs, the UK's national centre of expertise on drugs and drugs law.
@OpenSociety A6. We all need to wake up. There's an UK drug overdose crisis. 1 in 3 drug overdoses in Europe happens in the UK. #DrugPolicyMuseum
A6. It‚Äôs profound what @OpenSociety has done to take the #DrugPolicyMuseum from New York to Montreal and now to London. https://t.co/drpXZotNsi
Come awaken Your Curiosity South Africa!! I'm looking forward to seeing you! #Libertyvukasummit! https://t.co/6PXQsdZdCH
A5. Incredible...from the art to the speakers. I‚Äôd never seen a museum dedicated to drug policy with incredible art + powerful programs. https://t.co/VQYbz5vWgH
A4. Second, we need to understand that current drug policies are ruining lives. And policy should be about creating a better society.
A4. Most of us know someone who‚Äôs incarcerated on drug charges. This has to be a global commitment to decriminalize + reduce harm. https://t.co/C1smkub8At
A3. Look at the numbers. In 2016, out of 19,766 federal drug cases, 50% were Latino + 23.6% Black according to U.S. Sentencing Commission.
A3. To keep it real, black &amp; brown people have been disproportionately impacted-from incarceration to lack of health services for recovery. https://t.co/WS4oKVJrBg
A2. However, the US must must learn from models from around the world that are working, like safe injection facilities + needle exchanges.
A2. I have always believed that drug use is a health issue, and that we cannot incarcerate our way out of this problem. We must change.
A2. The shift in policy with regards to opioids was done by Obama. However, the problem remains under Trump. #DrugPolicyMuseum https://t.co/AEa7AnhpAq
A1. Bad drug policy has destroyed the fabric of the black community in the US and poor communities around the world.
A1. I‚Äôve worked my entire life to change drug laws in the US. I also recognize there are so many bad drug laws worldwide. #DrugPolicyMuseum https://t.co/80Ny3PQJI5

If you just remember to breathe and smile before you act, you‚Äôll always make the right decision.
When the mind is still experiences become "colorless" they have no bearing on happiness. superich =" the state of needing nothing".prevails
The yogi comes out of corpse pose born again. He-she should leave all that doesn't serve her behind on the mat.  And be re born again.
I'm not very celebratory too many bday gifts !! but the cards about how lives have been changed.. that's my gift/ source of joy. Giving joy
Give happiness this gift leads to happiness for yourself.  Give what you want to receive.  If u want money help someone else  make money

@CrownHeightsMOV @matt_ruskin If you are in NYC, go see #CrownHeights this weekend! We must support films that tell the stories of our people!  https://t.co/58Reazscei
@CrownHeightsMOV The incredible @Matt_Ruskin wrote + directed #CrownHeights, a film about Colin + his best friend Carl King who fought for his freedom.
@CrownHeightsMOV Colin Warner was a victim of this era and sacrificed 20 yrs of his life behind bars for a crime that he didn't commit. He was from Brooklyn.
@CrownHeightsMOV The "tough on crime" era began with terrible racist policies that led to horrible policing that destroyed the fabric of the black community.
@CrownHeightsMOV We all knew a guy who got railroaded by the system. Everyone in the hood knew he didn't do it, but the cops and the DA got a conviction.
@CrownHeightsMOV In Hollis, almost every one I grew up either got sent away on some drug charge for decades or ended up dead. But we all knew a Colin Warner.
@CrownHeightsMOV For far too many of us, who grew up in black and brown communities, we all know a Colin Warner. Someone who got locked up for far too long.
@CrownHeightsMOV A criminal justice system deeply rooted in institutional racism, archaic sentencing laws + a war on drugs that decimated black communities.
His name is Colin Warner. He spent 20 yrs in prison for a crime he didn't do. A victim of a broken criminal justice system. #CrownHeights https://t.co/P68yvmWLke

Most of the great ideas we have in life are born out of the fleeting moments of stillness.
Let go. Breathe.
The mind on drugs is cluttered. The mind on meditation is clear.

Despite our good intentions, we‚Äôre constantly having our intensity compromised by a host of distractions
A clear uncluttered mind is always the one that will take you to your highest heights.
If you spend most of your time in the stress of the world, then you need to embrace the power of meditation.
You don't have to believe in your abilities as a meditator for it to work. You just have to take the time to do it.
Stop worrying about how much money you make off your work and instead just stay focused on your work itself.

Take some of your daily effort and direct it toward the place where you're going to see an amazing return on your investment: your mind.
Go past the surface and begin to experience life at its depths.
No matter what‚Äôs going on around you or what's being said about you, keep a laser ¬≠like focus on your vision.
Happiness sits in the heart.
Everyday, I'm so thankful that I know what it means to operate out of stillness.
If¬†you learn late, you pass it on to people so they can learn early. It's a step process.
Our¬†prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.

A calm mind is a creative mind. And a creative mind is going to bring a lot of success into your life.
Serve God, do good karmic work, let go of all neediness and the mind will settle.
Maintain your mind.

The truth is that nothing promotes happiness like a quiet mind.
What holds most people back isn't the quality of their ideas, but their lack of faith in themselves.
When you do good by the world, the world will do good by you.
Use meditation to bring yourself back to that stillness where all your good ideas reside.
Decide that no matter what is happening around you, the sun will always be shining in your world.

Condition your mind to not get entangled in worry.

My religion is my compassion.
The truth is that nothing promotes happiness like a quiet mind.
Beauty is in the present. The more you meditate the more it expounds on this basic birthright, this happiness, that is in your core.
If¬†you learn late, you pass it on to people so they can learn early. It's a step process.
You've got to tell God thank you every day.
I don‚Äôt start and quit‚Äîever. I start and stay on it.

The most powerful step in realizing your potential is simply to be present in the world.
People are always waiting for something to happen in their personal lives before they can be happy #appreciatenow
We've come to accept that the self-centered, egotistical person will get more out of life. But for such people happiness proves elusive.
Stillness is the fertile soil in which imagination is nourished, and ideas can grow to incredible heights.
‚ÄúThe genius of man is hidden in the silent, settled state of mind from where every thought emerges.‚Äù ‚Äì Maharishi Mahesh
The¬†only¬†goal¬†of¬†yoga¬†is¬†to¬†help¬†you¬†become¬†at¬†peace.
Block out the noise and refocus on what‚Äôs inside of you.
No matter what‚Äôs going on around you or what's being said about you, keep a laser ¬≠like focus on your vision.
Forget results you have no control over and don't bring happiness. Instead delve deep into your work until it becomes your prayer.

For the compassionate and empathetic person, happiness is almost guaranteed.
In the end, the overriding factor in whether or not you realize your dreams is going to be you. Not the world. YOU.

Just keep on grindin‚Äô without worrying about the results.
Gaining lasting happiness can only come through sustained, consistent effort.
Meditation is a discipline; you have to practice it.
Maintain your mind.
When you let the noise distract you, it becomes very easy to move through life thinking, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just the way I am.‚Äù
The world is perfect. Until you slow down and access the stillness inside of you, sometimes it's hard to see that perfection.
The older we get the more critical people become when we tap into our inherent creativity because that is where our good ideas come from.
No matter how hectic your life might be feeling, understand that the best thing you can be doing at that time is to simply be still.
You can‚Äôt get no money in the future or in the past, you have to be present.

There will always be a need to promote fairness, justice and opportunity for the under-served surrounding issues far too many to list here.
...my prayer is for you to continue to use your influence to bring out the best in all of us.
Though we would never imagine you would use your power to do anything else but continue to serve the people...
... and choose a path of righteousness wherever it is obvious and clear.
I am banking on the fact that you are talented and persuasive enough to influence the incoming regime to follow their better angels...
Your presidency embodied the connection that weaves between all living beings.
...with the same aspirations, hopes and desires for ourselves and our children.
I pray we can call on you to take on the roles as a negotiator and bridge-builder. I have to believe at our very core we are ALL the same...
Fortunately, there are millions of other Americans ‚Äî led by the younger generation ‚Äî ready to fill that role.

...as a real and growing threat against our very survival as a species? Who will recognize animal agriculture as a leading contributor...
Healthy food at public schools? Who will protect the environment by recognizing and raising awareness about the crisis of climate change...
Who will make sure every American has access to affordable healthcare? Who will make sure our youth have proper educations?
Who will look after us now? Who will support sanctuary cities for immigrants?
...and our hero during a time that has us bracing to accept the reality of the most untested and erratic President-elect in history.

Next thing I knew, I found myself sitting in the cold, choking back tears, watching you being sworn in, feeling waves of pride...
It was my pleasure to go on the road for you from city to college campus, to lend my voice to the best of my ability to your campaign.

Years later, I met you at a rally in Chicago and then again at a friend‚Äôs house as you were planning your run for the presidency.
The first time I met you was when you were still an Illinois State Senator and you joined us at one of our hip-hop summits.
Lots of times I pray when I am at a loss. I don‚Äôt know where to begin so I guess I will begin at the beginning...
It seems like a small gesture given all the good you have done for America and the hope you infused into the consciousness of our nation.
