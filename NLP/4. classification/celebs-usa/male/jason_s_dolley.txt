@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane Side note, I still haven’t figured out threads. Welcome to Twitter, me.
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane Don’t get me wrong. I will always love Minutemen. There’s a lot to love. I believe movies are important, which is why I think it’s necessary to watch them with a critical lens. Even when you’re in them.
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane I don’t think it’s crazy to believe that a young, impressionable mind would watch Minutemen and come away thinking that boys shouldn’t wear dresses or makeup and if they do, it has to be a joke.   And we don’t want people thinking that, do we?
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane Our main character, the person with whom we are most meant to identify, acknowledges that the bigotry at the heart of The Incident has value and power, as does the entire school.
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane Well, but that’s the bully’s doing that, right? Bad guys do bad things; isn’t that how it goes? The problem is that it works. It sticks with Virgil and drives his desire to reassert himself as popular and (arguably) masculine. Or at least his idea of masculine.
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane The “joke” being “HAHAHAH BOYS DONT WEAR SKIRTS AND MAKEUP HAHAHAH”  Dresses and lipstick are a lot of people’s Friday night. They’re a lot of people’s every day, for that matter, regardless of gender identity. There’s really no joke at play in The Incident, just ignorance.
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane What are Minutemen’s flaws, you ask?  The big one for me is The Incident. Virgil and Charlie are dressed up as cheerleaders, have makeup slathered on them, and are hung on display in front of the school.
@domalley_14 @lukebenward @nicholasbraun @ChelseaKane Dan: Never stop writing about and thinking about and loving movies. I love them too. And I love this thread. So thank you.   We can love a movie and point out it’s flaws, yes? I think the more we love movies, the more we should hold them accountable. (A thread)

This is my birthday. There are many like it, but this one is mine.  And, like, a ton of other people's. Happy birthday, other people!
Surprised with birthday cake at work today. I'm going to miss these folks. http://t.co/Ys7tKfXeuR
@EricAllanKramer @bradley_s_perry For me, it was always a hunt for the mango.
And I thought GLC ending was hard...  Ian McKellen's Last Day as Gandalf - IGN: http://t.co/nb7XT38CK8 via @IGN
Last live audience show was tonight. The reality of the show ending is starting to sink in.

@Soren_Ltd 760 clips of you flexing your muscles? My computer would probably explode.
@Soren_Ltd Also, After Hours is the best. It makes me look at pop culture in a way that makes me like a lot less of it. Which I like. A lot.
@Soren_Ltd I'll send them the clip of you flexing every muscle in your body.

@SteveCarell Thanks! It's cool to think someone we enjoy watching so much watches us, too.  You'd be welcome on our set any time.
Hey, all. If you like the idea of teaching youngsters about the environment, vote for Sprout Up.  Today's the last day! http://t.co/FjTLLu1z
If you call yourself a gamer, you need to see @wreckitralph.  If not, give it a shot anyway.
Breaking my vow of tweet silence (not a real thing) to tell you to check out Bridgit Mendler's debut album.  https://t.co/yVXsDNf7
AT&amp;T store in North Olmstead today. 2-4 P.M. w/ #RadioDisney. You can get an autograph, take pictures, ask me about the iPhone...
On my way to Cleveland for the weekend. I'll be with #RadioDisney at the AT&amp;T store in North Olmsted Saturday, then the Indians/Twins game.
Disneyland... It's been too long.
From Scotland, with love. http://t.co/k5Axnl1p
I'm breaking my vow of silence to show you my character in the upcoming Pixie Hollow Games special.  Nov. 19 on Disney. http://t.co/LaMxixL7
So, long time no tweet. Anyway, Mama Leigh (aka Amy Duncan) is now officially on Twitter. @L_A_Baker. Yup.
@yaboyro just stole one of my sweet potato fries... Well. Not really.
Disneyland tomorrow!! So stoked
@bradley_s_perry This is the official twitter of Bradley Steven Perry (Gabe from Good Luck Charlie).  So, yeah.  Check it out.
Tonight's the big night! Good Luck Charlie premieres at 8:30 PM Pacific on Disney Channel.
@jrfoldes yeah for sure. What's her name? And what is the second trivia? I know the nom-de-guerre... But what was the other one?
We had a Duncan family Christmas dinner tonight. Just one of the many traditions at GLC.
@jrfoldes by his last count, 496.
@jrfoldes no not yet. And there is a specific number.
Don't usually see a camel and a reindeer on the way into work.  http://twitpic.com/t2jt9
@jrfoldes all kinds. And I believe he has experienced all of them.
@jrfoldes oh and I have a question for you. How many different kinds of pain has Batman kept record of?
@jrfoldes I guess I'm just not a fan of superhero dogs. Never read anything with ace though.
@jrfoldes well. Even though I've never heard of ace, probably not. Krypto's role is hush almost turned me off of the series. Cont.
@jrfoldes I think bat-mite is in Bruce's head. Part of his Zur-en-arrh persona.
@jrfoldes actually no. I read a lot of the comics from the 40's. Joker, Karlo, and strange were all in those very early on. Cont.
@ipegmeg no. I have no YouTube account.
@jrfoldes clayface? Hugo strange?
@katejudochop that's what I thought. I did laugh out loud when I read it though. :)
@jrfoldes woah! Alfred got buff. I love the new batsuit look. What is this for exactly?
It's robe day on set of GLC! We've had cape day and hat day too. Any other theme day suggestions?
@jrfoldes my insticts tell me the joker, but that's too easy. I'm thinking doctor death.
@jrfoldes that was Jerry Siegel's dad right? Co creator of SUPERman.
At the Variety power of youth with my awesome fans @Marissa_Rachel @emilyissorandom @jojojb.
Heading to Variety's Power of Youth event!
@jrfoldes Gotham: new York. Metropolis: Toronto
@jrfoldes oh yeah that's right. That's from Hush so I figured you knew right away.
@jrfoldes you can tell me drake's friends. But not the riddle. And what's this about a bet?
@x3nitashax3 I have no idea who that is. :)
@jrfoldes don't know drake's best friends. Don't know the answer to your riddle. Yet. So don't tell me. I'll let you know if I give up.
@jrfoldes back at you. I read RIP!!! so great. Batman really does prepare for anything. I also read tower of babel. That's another great one
@jrfoldes wait what? What record?
@jrfoldes hmmm. Ok. What time is it when an elephant sits on a fence?
@jrfoldes bill finger. Am I right? Ok actual question: do you know anything about a comic run with Batman in the 1700's?
@jrfoldes yes and yes. You were right about nightwing, and the book is called Seduction of the Innocent by Fredric Wertham.
@jrfoldes wait. A real book? Or one in the comics?
@jrfoldes Grayson. He's the first. The one who established it. But drake is second. Question 4 you: where does the name Nightwing come from?
@jrfoldes but Nolan made it pretty clear Grayson won't be in the next one. And I don't know how Valley fits in.
@jrfoldes that depends on who is in it. I really don't think I would be right for anyone other than Grayson or Azrael. (cont)
@jrfoldes I think robin needs to come in at the very end. Kind of like what happens in Dark Victory.
@jrfoldes hmm. I would imagine it as a cacophony of villains. Riddler, Penguin, Catwoman at least. Maybe Clayface and Mr Freeze too. (cont.)
You are never too old to wear a cape.
@JasonDolleyFan oh and thanks for poser-busting for me. :)
@JasonDolleyFan yes I did grow up with batman. Watched the 60's show over and over, had robin PJs, the whole deal. And no I like Dark Knight
@jrfoldes Gasp. How did you deduce that? And I'm almost through watchmen, which is fantastic. Then I have batman gothic. I'll get to RIP tho
@MariadelMar_ Yes!!! Oh man I loved working on that show. Thanks for watching!!
@TheMattNicholas yeah sometimes. It depends.
Just left six flags. We sported capes all day long.
@jrfoldes nope. Did it myself.
@jrfoldes that would be epic. If you didn't live in British Columbia. (still haven't read RIP btw.) reading watchmen now though.
I'm gonna scare trick or treaters with some friends. It's kind of a tradition. :)
Heading to the Camp Ronald McDonald Camp for Good Times Halloween Carnival. I'll be signing autographs from 12:45-2:00.
Why so serious? http://twitpic.com/mwigg
@jrfoldes Heath Ledger's Joker! I'm so stoked.
@JasonDolleyFan but lately they have been timely, so it's possible your picture is already in the mail.
@JasonDolleyFan no it's not bad. In the past, it's taken a while for the mail to get forwarded to me from Disney Channel. It's a big office
@jrfoldes no not yet. Yup I've read all those other ones (favorite being the killing joke).
"Snow and adolescence are the only two problems that will go away if you ignore them long enough."
@bevancouver for sure. I'll tweet some pics.
@zshoe I'm gonna go with Heath ledger's. It's the best.
@JasonDolleyFan it varies. Depending on where it gets sent. Where did you send yours?
@jrfoldes I think it could be cool. I haven't read any of the ones with him as batman. Still need to read batman RIP.
@mariissa_rey um. Batman beats superman in Hush. Just sayin. :)
@JasonDolleyFan no. Just a stamped, self addressed envelope.
@rachelwinston17 but does it matter where they come from? Batman could keep Spidey guessing. And I'm a total dork too. No worries.
@ana5s usually, because there isn't anything to say. That, or I miss your tweets. :)
@rachelwinston17 mmm. Probably not. Bats can out-think Spidey. That's enough to convince me that he could beat Spiderman.
@zshoe yeah long Halloween is a good one. I love Hush for Jim Lee's artwork, but as far as story goes, i think The Killing Joke.
@thamyresmoreira hey there! I see you've been persistent. :) I had a midterm today so I wasn't able to get on today. And Anne is awesome.
@LoyalKriss1313 no way! That's awesome. That puts an even bigger smile on my already smiling face. :)
ZOMBIELAND!!
@anned91 Anne!! Of course I remember. Whenever I'm asked in interviews about cool fan stories, I always talk about seeing you on the cruise
@jason_dolleyfan nope. Just Twitter. :)
@JasonDolleyFan it's not a full cut it was just a trim. And he was in a hurry to get somewhere so I didn't want to bother him.
Dinner at tomo sushi with @bmendler707700 and @TheDebbyRyan. The crunchy rolls there are to die for!!
@Lejla2594 @abee02 you are walking backwards.
@mileyfann1994 nope. No YouTube. At least, not yet. :)
Just went to @selenagomez album release party. She's the best. :)
@TheDebbyRyan wait, how do you know about butterflies and rainbows?
Random. Meaningless. But somehow, still awesome.  http://twitvid.com/853D1
Home cooking Wednesday. Today, Eric made fajitas. Soooo good!!!! http://twitvid.com/E2598
@bevancouver I think it mentions me in my tweet when I reply to a comment of one of my videos on twitvids. Weird.
@jason_s_dolley eventually.  i think.  I never really saw it come out.  It probably did when the dude started his truck though. http://t ...
we found a chicken underneath someone's truck at church today. http://twitvid.com/C461B
Good Luck Charlie, aka GLC, is set to come out in April of 2010.  I play P.J., the oldest brother. Can't wait for you all to see it!
I finally got a twitter!
