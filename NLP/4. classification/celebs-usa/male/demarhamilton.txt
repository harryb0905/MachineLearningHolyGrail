I'll be honest, I cry sometimes. However I find it funny when NBA players cry because they thought they were going to be the best NBA team.

I am laughing out loud. ‚Äú@retondo: @aileenburns Absolutely not. I need meat and cheese in some kind of carbohydrate wrapper to survive.‚Äù
Things I hate: being called boss by someone who is not your employee. You know what I'm talking about.

@evantaubenfeld its awesome. I get to less work and still reap all the benefits. However I do play drums on our latest almost hit single.
I met Jeremy Roenick tonight. He tried and failed at singing "Hey There Delilah" to me.
Last night's episode of Mad Men was extremely great.
Rhythm Of Love is the #1 most aired video on VH1 this week. Life is good!
Good to hang with @steegs and @tonconrad.

@CantinaLaredoUK it was called Wahaca. Maybe we need to check out your place next time were around.
Had my first PSL of the season. It was great.
Gotta get up early to help my main man @joelbednarz move. I'm glad to help him I just know I'm gonna hate him when that alarm goes off.
Oops spoke too soon. Now the sun is out. It was about time.
To be outside today in Chicago is just depressing.
Coffee at 6pm central time when my body is still on London time which would make it 12am there? Why not?!
9 hr flight and didn't sleep a wink. I hope this doesn't screw me up. What's up America?! Time to party!!
LHR to ORD. Slightly looking forward to being back in America.
@hellokiera Oh wow that's really cool you were there! Thanks! Come to the show on the 21st. I promise we'll play longer.
Well that was surprising. That was the best meal I've had since I've been over here.
About to have Mexican food in London. This may turn out to be a really bad decision.
Not at all excited that football is back. Maybe I'll get into it this season. Highly doubtful.
Day off in London with the boys. Gonna do a some shopping and eating. Good times.

Just played a show and had dinner with our new UK label. Had to put the game face on.
@JMatthewFlyzik cool. ill let the kids outside stalking and asking us if you guys are staying there know.
@willpug yo that was a good ass time!
@JMatthewFlyzik K West. Have a suspicion you guys are also there. True or false?
People watching at a mall in London. Still coming to terms with being in a different country. Maybe I'm just exhausted.
Feels good to be in London! I think it's been 2 years since we've been here.

I know how to use a power drill. That's a serious accomplishment for me.
Making real life decisions are tough especially when it comes to what songs to cut/put on your record. Gotta just cross your fingers and go!
Somehow I got roped into going to the Haunted Trails. I feel like I'm 7.
@IFM24 No America is great! I just love being in Europe. Haven't been in so long.
@NicShizzle Yes we are. We better see each other. We'll be there a lot.
Looks like I'll be spending a great part of September not in America! This excites me. For real.
@MarcWilsonWC I stumbled upon it watching videos of us. There are a ton of breast feeding videos. It was disturbing.
@ryantunall Here you go. Enjoy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPw_waKisKs&feature=related
Just found a video on YouTube of a woman breast feeding her baby while PWTS "Take Me Away" plays as the soundtrack. The internet is weird.
My neglect to get cable means that I spend my Monday afternoons catching up on Sunday night's TV shows via the internet.
