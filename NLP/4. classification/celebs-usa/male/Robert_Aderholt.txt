Congratulations to the @aafiron on their great debut showing!  1-0! https://t.co/74k3rt1FOP
The Democrats’ new ‘Green Deal’ will provide a living wage to those “unwilling to work.”  This is not what we should want our children to aspire to grow up and become, “unwilling to work.”  But this plan encourages just that.
This pretty much speaks for itself.  The @realDonaldTrump speech was not just well received by most in the chamber but across the country. The same poll showed 72% agree with his immigration plan, so I say to my colleagues, let’s get to it! https://t.co/01bhGXBdYm
I'm glad to see that the @USDA is reining in abuse of SNAP benefit waivers that allowed able bodied individuals with no children, to receive benefits without having to work. If you are able to work &amp; have no dependents, you should be working as a requirement for those benefits.
Today I joined President Trump in the Oval Office as he signed an executive order that will strengthen "Buy American" provisions that I have championed.  Government funded infrastructure projects being built with American tax dollars should be built with American made products. https://t.co/AMiiCi9fBg
@FUN927 Congratulations Michael!
In the rush to claim victory to deny initial funding for Border Security I wonder if the Democrats will remember their pledge to negotiate w/the White House to address what is a very real problem?  Three weeks is not long enough to take a victory lap AND negotiate a solution...

For far too long, foreign countries have levied significantly higher tariffs on the U.S. ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ understands these types of acts are unjust. The U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act would provide the President leverage to lower their unfair tariffs. https://t.co/qqQZrDG7IA
This morning, 214 Democrats denied furloughed DHS employees immediate pay. Democrats continue to use the suffering of our public servants as a political tool to keep them away from the negotiating table. For the third time now, Democrats prove they aren’t looking for solutions. https://t.co/hHrQiOBBfx
It was great being on this morning with @AunieLindenberg and with @ScottBeason.  We talked about the shutdown, the SOTU and what’s it like working with some of the new members of Congress. https://t.co/DOzpgVzOUL
The President is offering solutions to the shutdown and continues to show a spirit of negotiation. This is in sharp contrast to Congressional Democrats who reject ideas before they’ve even heard them.
Today, thousands of Americans joined together to mark the 46th anniversary of a terrible moment in American history – Roe V Wade. We mourn the loss of 60 million unborn children since 1973.  We must continue to fight for these children who do not have a voice of their own. https://t.co/bZi4p5G1Gi

The strength of the American economy, and the American consumer, comes with a lot of negotiating power.  Power that has too often not been used, to the detriment of American workers.  Those days are over.
All throughout the 2016 campaign, Democrats laughed at the idea we could renegotiate our trade deals.  With this important step towards a new NAFTA deal, President @realDonaldTrump has once again proven these critics wrong.
I would also be remiss not to mention his unwavering support for making sure we have the strongest military in the world. His life was dedicated to public service.
I’m sorry to hear of the death of Senator John McCain.  He and so many other American military personnel survived an existence as a POW in Vietnam that most of us could never imagine.  My prayers to his family during this difficult time.

I remain focused on the positives this administration has delivered on economic growth, rolling back overreaching government regulations and acting like the super-power we are.
Many on the left want to jump on these Cohen and Manafort cases as if it is also an automatic conviction of the President. The reality is that we don’t know what impact, if any, this will have on the President. They are just grasping at anything.
I applaud these changes. They will protect the environment while also protecting Alabama jobs. The Obama era rules were overreaching and job killing. https://t.co/27QHbxgQw4

My staff and I are working to save rural hospitals in the 4th Congressional District.  We worked with the USDA to make it possible for the hospital in Winfield to be sold to new owners, thus saving it from closure.   https://t.co/hFD8kuo8zY
Today the @HouseAppropsGOP passed the annual funding bill for the @USDA, the @US_FDA, and other related agencies. I am proud to move the bill through the second step of the legislative process while continuing to make rural America great again. Next step is the House Floor. https://t.co/ABWW0X3OfJ

If Trump were to find a cure for cancer then the national press would report that he is ignoring all other diseases.   Truth of matter is that North Korea detainees were released and more progress towards denuclearization made than under last 3 presidents. https://t.co/EXeOV6Eq53

President Trump continues to impress with his foreign policy achievements. Like Reagan before him, the President is achieving “peace through strength.” https://t.co/3vrcFz5hwg
There are several things that remain puzzling about the agreement.  For example, many of us are still waiting to see what benefits the Obama Administration hoped to see when they delivered pallets of cash in the dead of night to Iran, a known state sponsor of terrorism.
President Trump has taken the Iran Nuclear Deal, and its shortcomings, very seriously. With all the information he has at his disposal, I trust that he has made the right decision to pull back from what was a bad deal adopted under the Obama Administration.
Tonight on the steps of our Gadsden office, 80 high school students took their military oaths. They are going into the Army, Air Force and Marines. You all make us proud with your commitment to serve our nation. @WBRCnews @WVTM13 @abc3340 @CBS_42 https://t.co/ACA6Ak6N2V

@MikeCasonAL ...just another example of how our tax cuts are hitting everybody’s bottom line.   Unemployment is at a 17 year low w/ Alabama leading the national average. Wages are going up as the economy continues to grow due to lower taxes and less federal regulation. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
On this day, I pray for the countless families and communities that are still grief stricken and I pray for the continued progress of rebuilding our communities. https://t.co/P5DHnW6o4Y
If we gained anything that day, it was a stronger sense of community. Families and communities wrapped one another in each other’s arms beginning the healing process that would lead them through such difficult times. https://t.co/LbtF1dQelw
Seven years ago today, our state and district was struck by a series of storms that would forever change the lives of thousands of people as well as the communities that sheltered them. On that day, we lost over 200 mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers. https://t.co/KfCm0wiklx

Hanceville, AL workers at American Proteins Inc. are the latest people to receive a $1,000 bonus check as a result of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. The economy is now moving again and unemployment is at its lowest point in 17 years. #TaxDay https://t.co/zuX62y24U8
It’s #TaxDay and this year we are saying goodbye to an old, outdated tax code. Thanks to the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, Alabamians will be receiving a larger standard deduction, a doubled child tax credit, and a fairer and simpler filing process.

19 of the missiles dropped on the Syrian chemical weapons program were made right here in Alabama. The Lockheed Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missiles are stealthy and can evade enemy defenses. This is just one of the ways Alabamians are contributing to our national defense. https://t.co/fKrE0xRjj2
My family and I are extending our thoughts and prayers to former First Lady Barbara Bush and the Bush family as they face such hard times. Former First Lady Barbara Bush was and continues to be a role model for millions.
Mission was to send strong signal not just to Assad but others that would use chemical weapons in armed conflict:  "The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons," Trump said. (Politico 4/13/18) https://t.co/sZpyZcI1ou
I support our President and the brave members of our armed forces as they carry out a response to the brutal actions of the Syrian regime. Please join me in praying for them and this troubled region.

So sorry to hear of the passing of the Rev. Billy Graham. He helped lead an untold number of people to Christ. He truly fought the good fight, finished the course and kept the faith.

It was interesting to see over the past several days so many of the Democrats that went out of their way to discredit this report before it was even released.  I hope this information can help people understand this entire situation.
The public should be able to have confidence that our institutions, including the FBI, are not being politicized in favor of one candidate over another.   That's why we need transparency to show what the true facts were.   This is not the way the system should work.
I am very pleased the FISA memo from the House Intelligence Committee has been released to the public. I read the memo two weeks ago,  and felt the information was extremely important and should be seen by the American people. https://t.co/j43vun850l
I just wanted to send a quick note to let everyone know Caroline and I are fine. We were on the train headed to a Republican planning conference when the train collided with a truck. I’m told one person in the truck has died. Our prayers to that person’s family &amp; any others hurt.
The polling shows that the American people overwhelmingly felt the same way about the President’s speech as I did, with great approval! #SOTU2018 https://t.co/ctfuHVeDgP
Because of President Trump’s willingness to shake things up in Washington, and to step over entrenched partisan lines, the State of the Union is strong.
Despite resistance from the Washington establishment, President Trump’s first year has been marked with robust economic growth, job creation, record highs in the stock market and record lows when it comes to unemployment.
I’m looking forward to President Trump’s first SOTU speech tonight. It begins at 8pm Central Time.  #SOTU2018 https://t.co/fOwYhEwBfu
I applaud the vote by the House Intelligence Committee tonight to release the FISA memo to the American people.  #ReleaseTheMemo
5. Rodney Frelinghuysen is still chairman of the full committee and still has a full work schedule in front of us. I look forward to working with Chairman Frelinghuysen as he leads the committee through the coming months.
4. If allowed by my colleagues to serve as the next chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I look forward to addressing these challenges.
3. It is too soon to talk about changes and reforms to the appropriations process, but there is no doubt that major changes need to be made.
2. As Chairman, he had the distinction of helping to move all twelve Appropriations bills through the House for the first time in more than a decade.
1. Rodney Frelinghuysen has served with honor and distinction.  He will be missed for his level-headed thinking and service as Chairman of Appropriations.
@Copacetic_Cindy @realDonaldTrump I support releasing the memo

I read the classified House Intelligence Committee memo that details concerns about FISA surveillance abuses by the previous administration. Suffice it to say that I believe that the public should be able to view the same memo I did.    #ReleaseTheMemo
Let me be clear, House Members do not feel bound to resolve the differences in DACA &amp; immigration before the next funding deadline. House leadership has been consistent in their belief that these are two separate issues that will be resolved on two separate legislative tracks.
While the #schumershutdown continues, Monday morning my staff and I will be in our offices working as usual to do the people’s business.
Hard to negotiate anything when the hostage has been shot and bleeding out ...  DACA doesn’t expire until March but gov’t funding did last night.

Obama Administration further reducing sodium in schools based upon eating habits of European Children and 20-30 yr old studies.
