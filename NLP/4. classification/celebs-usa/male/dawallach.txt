@ScottGottliebMD glad to discover your feed here!
@matsoR Seb's sense of purity isnt valorized unambiguously. Legend defends his syncretic and pop approach explicitly. They're both right.
@matsoR and the film is ambivalent about both Gosling's and Legend's attitudes towards music.
@matsoR totally fair to capture a character (Sebastian) who is enthralled by a notion of pure jazz. Plenty of weird white guys like that.
@matsoR it's a wonderful thing that VW can play with African musical traditions. Or that Outkast can wear Ralph Lauren.
@matsoR we should reject the politics of cultural propriety.
@matsoR music and jazz have no color.
@matsoR how do you know none of the characters were gay?

@BenedictEvans How would you characterized what's been claimed?
@BenedictEvans That's not why I think it's a scam. Reality / the markets will be the jury. Evidently we don't have long to wait.

@MusicityManager not sure I understand the analogy you're making.
@MusicityManager @nntaleb @stewartbrand @berggruenInst Joel, we have been engineering nature for hundreds of years.
@nntaleb @stewartbrand @berggruenInst Plenty of "natural" traits are poisonous to us as proof of this.
@nntaleb @stewartbrand @berggruenInst The idea of species boundaries is contested and nature is full of randomness itself.
@nntaleb @stewartbrand @berggruenInst I don't see mechanistic substantiation of your idea that transgenics have impossible to predict danger

@DAVIDMDRAIMAN @Spotify @eldsjal @NikkiSixx BADASS
@Sharkyl I'm not sure how Kindle Unlimited payment model works. Amazon is still largely unit-sales driven. Amazon Prime I'm sure pays by use
@BenedictEvans They aren't anymore?
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify selling a cd to 2 ppl who listen to it diff amounts has badly monetized true listening volume.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify fortunately both ideas have considerable advantages to unit sales!
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify the industry is not familiar w per listener monetization. Jumping from units to streams hard enough.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify the key is that both the existing and alt approaches have strengths and weaknesses.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify the simple economics of the current model are already widely misunderstood.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify if every listen on the service were "worth" a different amount, that would be confusing to everyone.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify but that is ok because the simplicity of the model for the consumer and artist overrides.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify because they are consuming more. They are effectively lower margin for Spotify.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify not that I don't think there are certain advantages to your proposal :) just on balance.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify for now, keeping things as simple as possible feels important for Spotify / streaming.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify lala was charging in a semi-metered fashion. Would be interesting to see their #'s.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify which would always be the case w your proposal.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify possibly. But you don't want the most active listeners to be worth the least per play.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify you'd see higher per plays on mainstream music, lower on indie.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify way fewer listeners consume long tail than mainstream. Opposite would be likely.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify And if plays for one artist earn as much as plays for another.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify Much cleaner if every artist is equally rewarded by any user listening to their music.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify Which would = a financial incentive towards having certain users listen to me vis a vis others.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify The alternative model would make plays from the most active listeners worth less.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify Hard to explain here, but basically, my view is that plays should all be equal. Pros and cons.
@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify Yes I was arguing for current structure.

@adammarx13 Working on changing that every day. Happy to answer any questions.
@onuryavuz @pmarca Already has been, to some degree. Why Spotify invested in The Echo Nest, etc. Trying to nail personalization &amp; curation!
@adammarx13 @pmarca Of course. Huge % of Spotify's plays are for independent artists and indie labels.
@zeynep @pmarca If you find any at coffee houses, please send them my way. I began by playing on street corners in Harvard Square.
@adammarx13 @pmarca Would be interesting to compare total financial value of the more marginal markets with the mainstream.
@adammarx13 @pmarca Possible. But I think the long tail has been overrated commercially. Most people want the best. Which is scarce.
@zeynep @pmarca I would argue that talent + taste is quite scarce. Over time if you have it and keep trying, you get some kind of leverage.
@PaulJun_ @pmarca Thanks!
@TefoMohapi @pmarca Good call! I was unfamiliar with that concept but it is perfectly analogous.
@zeynep @pmarca My advice is that all of us should resist vertical monopolies.

@pmarca We also need to figure out how to re-value non-market goods as a society. The marketization of EVERYTHING is not good.
@pmarca I have long advocated for UBI in some form, which I believe makes sense no matter how many jobs robots do or don't eat.
@pmarca I don't view it as a "luddite fallacy" - it's an argument in favor of thoughtfully adapting to major inevitable changes.
@pmarca My point is merely that the predictions of that letter have not been totally unrealized, and I think are largely before us.
@pmarca The main exodus of jobs accompanied deindustrialization and job exportation in the 80s &amp; 90s. Some cohorts were hit extremely hard.

@ArisTake @micahherstand @Spotify @pandora_radio I think it's a really cool concept. Not sure if or when we'd consider it, but I dig!
8/ @pmarca that may or may not turn out to be empirically true.
7/ @pmarca I just don't think we need to assume that anyone put out of work automatically is met by new opportunities.
6/ @pmarca to be clear, I am as enthusiastic as anyone about productivity gains, automation, robots, etc
5/ @pmarca totally possible that tech-driven structural unemployment requires political, not just market, solutions.
4/ @pmarca there is also plenty of valuable work that the market doesn't value well. Home work or raising children, for ex.
3/ @pmarca the never ending expansion of consumer desire was what he didn't predict. But that might have limits.
2/ @pmarca no less than Keynes predicted a massive "leisure problem" when productivity gains eliminated the need for most jobs.
. 1/@pmarca I think it's difficult to know whether new industries will require more or less labor than outdated ones.

@pmarca no merit to the notion that the new industries are less human-dependent than the old ones?

@pmarca which new ones employ more people than the old ones? Any examples?

.@pmarca and his long term focus is on inherited wealth. It's about a future of rich kids controlling everything. Scary!
. @pmarca also forgot: the threshold of growth Piketty identifies for wealth compounding is not too high historically: 5% I think.
My eye. http://t.co/aXMmsvgv6e
@pmarca No such thing as a free market; any is structured by legal rules. Compounding political influence is the bedfellow of ec dominance.
@pmarca It is not simply that their wealth-compounding opportunities are terrific; it's that they are writing the rules of gov.
@pmarca The more important aspect of the argument is about the unfair advantages that fin elites derive from existing policies.

@pmarca Now that's a real industry to disrupt....clothing! p.s. - this is fucking crazy. Awesome that you keep this article on deck.
@pmarca Imagine if the voting test were just matching each candidates agenda w his/her name. If you do it, your vote counts.
@pmarca If Amazon then we could truly weight peoples' democratic voices based on their financial wealth! Just check your purchase history.
@pmarca True dat. It is a genuine prob that most of electorate does not understand what's being voted upon, myself included.
@pmarca This is really radical, and tricky given our terrible past with voting tests, but I actually think specific voting tests make sense.
@pmarca I would generalize this and say that all of us need to be protected from any of us who don't know the facts of reality.
@pmarca And it's also because they can't leave work for 3 hours to stand in a line like suburban moms can. That's why we need voting holiday
@pmarca It is, but I believe it is largely symptomatic of a learned sense of irrelevance in the wider political-economy.
@pmarca Haha! Whether precision or superfluity I leave to your estimation, fine sir.
@pmarca There are also general informational asymmetries unconnected to just advertising.
@pmarca This is why we need, among other things, a voting holiday. Crazy that we don't have one.
@pmarca I agree that the poor are frequently patronized. But they also vote in lower percentages than rich old people, for instance.
Happy Birthday, @Pharrell ! I'm not sure next year could go any better than this one, but here's hoping it does!!!

@RiversCuomo Yeah it's kinda weird. I can't think of anything else like that in music history. Marley sounds like a place, but not a time.
I don't think people hear Bob Marley as "retro," in a way that even the Beatles are today (not saying better...Beatles are #1 ever to me!).
His music remains immensely popular in every continent on earth and, strangely, feels perennially current.
I submit: Bob Marley is the most popular pop musician in history.

I love some electronic music, but the difference in quality, craftsmanship, and soulforce couldn't have been starker.
After leaving the show I got in my car and the radio switched-on to an over-compressed, oversexed, and truly stupid house track.
It's easy to forget today how dynamic, nuanced, and substantive a brilliant and practiced musical master's work can be.

@MarionManeker @pmarca There are models (not for twitter) whereby artists could directly benefit from 2nd market, not just reputationally.
@MarionManeker @pmarca It seems likely to me that the credible, higher end market will expand to include lower priced work, primary and 2nd
@MarionManeker @pmarca I mean right now the market is polarized b/w "real art" (expensive) and folksy garbage for unsophisticated buyers.
@JanelleMonae Nice! Let me know if you need someone awesome to show you around!
@MarionManeker @pmarca but that's where you start really pissing off the establishment assholes!
@MarionManeker @pmarca There are also possibilities to disrupt high end secondary market so that it's better for artists.
@MarionManeker @pmarca None right now. By expanding the "credible" / "art" buyer market into lower price categories, they could.
@JoRoan Thank you!
@MarionManeker @pmarca But winner take all more like ebay or amazon marketplace.
@MarionManeker @pmarca I think it could easily become winner-take-all. If something like Artsy scales it likely will be.

@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget How much of this is a money protocol prob vs an identity prob?
@sircwn @pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget But then how would I buy my heroin? Without heroin, I'd have no energy to debate BTC.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget 100% agreed with that assessment.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Although a good smile can get you laid much quicker than a fat BTC wallet!
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget If one believes (as I do) in the scaling of BTC, all incentives point to holding, not spending on toothpaste!
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Right now, I think focus on merchant acceptance is misplaced is all. Slightly misplaced.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget That's not "instrinsic value" in the ben graham sense.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget Only way I would is if I instantly converted in and out of it for transaction benefits of protocol
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget As of now, I see no reason to spend my BTC.
@PierreCPA @pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Would you take out a mortgage like that? Projected inflation already accounted for in rate.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget So estimation of whether to spend rests SOLELY on future market behavior.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget But in BTC there is no intrinsic value vis a vis an equity.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Totally. Protocol is awesome. I think @ripple has much more general utility off the shelf, but BTC is rad.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Would be silly to hedge loans with currency derivatives. BTC is AMAZING, etc etc but it IS not good for every use
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget But then that would introduce unnecessary complexity.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget If lenders allowed me to pay them nominally less to adjust for deflation that would be diff.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Not critiquing liquidity. Raising the point that I wouldn't take a loan that is more expensive when I pay it back
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget Also, the currency risk of spending is unique...have to realize gain when I spend, unlike USD.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget That would be weird. I would hold it so long as I can spend other money that won't appreciate.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget If, as is likely, demand continues to mount while supply is limited (as it is), then prices in BTC deflate.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget If people don't want BTC in the future, the prices of things in BTC would inflate.
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Not sure I'd agree. Are we talking about price inflation/deflation or currency value inflation/deflation?
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget Bad replacement for the currency of credit markets. Good replacement for gold (as one example).
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget I'm just saying deflationary aspect of BTC makes it good for some things bad for others.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget The incentive is to spend your money that looks like it will decrease in value.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget If some of my money looks like it will continue becoming more valuable, why would I spend it?
@pmarca @EghosaO @hblodget Inflation would be of prices, which is possible if demand for the currency decreases faster than production.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget Which is part of why we left the gold standard.
@pmarca @rajeshj @russhatfield @hblodget Also, the commodity component creates disincentive to spend. And deflation means bad for credit.
@pmarca @zhenpanda178 @hblodget And now can subdivide these finite assets by proxy: http://t.co/qOtNzPk9DX
@pmarca @rajeshj @hblodget A lot of this inefficiency is owed to credit risk assumed by issuing banks. Can be better, but not SUPER broken.
@pmarca This is an epidemic in SV. Self-help business culture capitol of the universe.
@pmarca Need to incent freedom and risk-taking, not esoteric group-think. Feels like the opposite is the current operating consequence.

@munsterchief What matters is what works objectively, and importantly, what works for the people for whom things must work!
@hanzullo I suggest we give everyone a basic safety net irrespective of work status.
@hanzullo I don't believe everyone needs to be equals. I believe no one should starve if they can't or don't work.
What we need are agile, iterative policies that allow the best ideas to thrive and justify additional resources in real-time.
When the stakes are so high for getting things perfect only once, we end up with Obamacare-like policies.
We need to inject an entrepreneurial, experimental energy into American govt and econ policy. Everything feels impossible now.
We need to stop puritanically tying dignity to work.
Capitalism's greatest deficiency is that it does not value individuals in a society merely for being alive.
UBI is an idea that has fascinated me for a long time, and I'd love to see our society experimenting with it, at least.

@IamAgriot I didn't see the link you sent.
@IamAgriot I have massive privilege. I am white, rich, american, male, etc. This begets responsibility to truth and justice. Doing my best.
@IamAgriot my perception is biased just as yours is. All that matters is the underlying truth, however.
@MikePosner @EliSweet thank you both so much.
Race is one of the stupidest things people have ever invented.
@IamAgriot that's my real life. Both Max and I have been in interracial relationships for the past 6 years.
@IamAgriot That was not how the script was written, directed, or performed. The actresses would confirm it.
@IamAgriot But this is so expected of pop and rap videos these days that it never generates an outcry.
@IamAgriot Also, it seems obvious to me that hundreds of music videos are far more objectifying of women, and esp black women, than ours.
@IamAgriot Ultimately, I feel the art succeeded in creating a conversation about gender, race, and sexuality. Not much pop music does that.
@IamAgriot That is a subjective view. The intention was for her to be truly in control at the end. And having been there...she was.
@IamAgriot The video and song were meant to subvert and confuse racial, gender, and sexual orientation categories. Purposefully ambiguous.
@IamAgriot I think that view is obsessed with oppression and is an infinitely recursive trap.
@IamAgriot The second half of the video is a power reversal where she takes control.
@IamAgriot I think that's a simplistic interpretation. The black character was totally self-possessed and agentive.
@gpipes24 @CFStreetTeam thank you!
@IamAgriot what about the white girl in the video? I took great care to avoid the typical fetishism. The black character takes control, etc
@IamAgriot I see all people as fully human. Celebrating beauty and sexuality is different than objectifying.
@IamAgriot No. Why would I?

The problem afflicting this whole culture is that consumers don't pay. Spotify is getting them to pay again, finally.
It is so sad to me that musicians are confusing Spotify for the enemy. Simply, music lost its economic value and Spotify is restoring it.

@davebry9 There is a sense of a double standard. If a white artist made that music, they would condemn it, I speculate.
@davebry9 The patronizing aspect of many critics' responses is that they don't use the same standards to evaluate rap as they do other music
@davebry9 That leaves his delivery, which is sort of accidentally very musical, and the beats, which are dope.
@davebry9 Regardless of one's own race, one can evaluate those lyrics from a critical standpoint and judge them for what they are.
@davebry9 So if the lyrics and personality behind them are THE centerpiece of it, I think listeners should thoughtfully reflect on those.
@davebry9 Unlike The Beatles or something, his music isn't firing on all cylinders.
@davebry9 1) The main substantive components of chief keef's music are the beat, the lyrics, and his delivery.

@paultoo Hey man I really liked your post "the gift."
@exit1200 Yep. I bet it's way more of accompaniment today than it was 40 years ago.
This is why hi-fi should have a real future. I wonder how many ppl have even heard a true stereo image. BEATS by Dre is not hi-fi.
The incredible imagery that complex counterpoint can inspire is probably because your brain can't make sense of the info and goes wild!
When you close your eyes and deprive your brain of visual signals, you construct a picture of physical space using auditory cues.
I think the reason music makes you see things is synesthesia. Your ears are designed to help you construct a physical image of the world.
If you close your eyes during music, you see things. Try it. If the music doesn't make you see things, you're only scratching the surface.
@exit1200 I think the proper way to listen to music is with your eyes closed though, engaging all the senses!
I suspect that most people do something else while listening to music. Do you do that to movies?
I wish I had some advice for you.
