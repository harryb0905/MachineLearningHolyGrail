@mongan_091 Cheers Gary! Happy holidays to you as well!
@_5cott @philgaimon We were even on oatmeal/raisin cookies if that makes you feel better. I did not earn $1000 dollars for charity though so I guess Phil takes that category. :)
Love chatting w/ the REAL @iamtedking. Vanishing mice, gravel ripping, house hunting, epic canoeing &amp; much more: https://t.co/o7Bxev0zyy

@JeremyPowers @CXHairs @Kielreijnen @JeremyPowers do you guys ever use sprint shifter buttons? Seems like it would make sense but might be tough to get each bike the same.
@JeremyPowers @CXHairs @Kielreijnen you should try ‘cross. Looks like sprinting in the hoods is the preferred method ;)
@BoringEnormous @astronaut_jesss
@RickMorgan9 @Vaughters @Ride_Argyle @EFNorthAmerica 😂😂😂
@Ride_Argyle @EFNorthAmerica Yeah folks, Mt. Evans! For the record, I did not ride it today. This time of year it’s closed at Echo Lake for obvious reasons.

@laflammerouge16 @mihkelraim @Tomashuuns @DeGendtThomas @conordunnealot @larrywarbasse @ChadHaga @ryanmullen9 I think @ryanmullen9 and I should just arm wrestle to determine the winner of our heat.
@philgaimon Maybe you’re fans only dig jam bands.
@jamiecadel @Cyclingnewsfeed @cpacycling Ha! You have far more faith in the rider's union than any of the riders do.

@Pflax1 “She faces ... a misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine or imprisonment between 30 and 90 days.” Guess we’re on the same level as Australia
I think I'm going to ride around and pick up trash all day today. https://t.co/1yKJWcBHHk
@Pflax1 Probably would have been a $50 fine in the states.
Really going to miss @huffyusa hot-routing around through the peloton. Such a fun a passionate person to be around on and off the bike. Big luck for the next chapters and much love. ❤️ https://t.co/M0w02jWvDV
@TheShawnH @huffyusa I think you’re absolutely correct
Love this piece. The parkour is amazing but it's totally worth watching the video just to see the sweat pants. 🤣 https://t.co/M1bmMnn3Ta
@peterstetina @philgaimon Yessss. Do my bidding.
This #SaveArgyle event in Boulder has been such a great excuse to get some really wonderful people together. So much fun! Thank you! 🙏

@sholomjaeger @rusty_woods @spino_powerlegs @lawsoncraddock @cannondalePro To be fair, those bags of cash were for a great cause. 🙏
@Pflax1 @philgaimon @AdamMyerson @dzabriskie @timjohnsoncx @iamtedking @B_Lea1 It's funny I made this list. Were I live now, bicycle advocacy = telling folks to remember to bring a buck knife, pack of matches and a tarp when they go out riding.
@KevinSprouse @lawsoncraddock @Ride_Argyle @rapha As long as you do it on a #Scalpel from @RideCannondale. Pretty sure with a name like that you could also write it off on your taxes ;)
@spino_powerlegs @lawsoncraddock @rusty_woods @cannondalePro Pufffff sure, it's possible if you have your level of fitness and grit, but @lawsoncraddock barely made it through the Tour on the nicest bikes in the peloton.
@lawsoncraddock @rusty_woods Turn that into a @cannondalePro and you're in.
@crupshaw @lawsoncraddock @Ride_Argyle @rapha .@Mitch_Bowen wins. We'll send him the trophy January 1.
@rusty_woods @lawsoncraddock '89. I'm doing Leadville. https://t.co/7fa7nTfxe2
@lawsoncraddock @Ride_Argyle @rapha Pretty sure I’m grandfathered in.
@ScottTietzel @coreycrlsn @nealrogers @Ride_Argyle YES!
@coreycrlsn @nealrogers @Ride_Argyle Not sure we have the roster depth to field a full squad. Might need to hire some guest riders ;)
@jverheul @nealrogers @Ride_Argyle As soon as I get a cassette for my cross bike!
Great piece from @nealrogers on the direction of @Ride_Argyle next year. Personally, I can’t wait to get out amongst the people &amp; shred! https://t.co/ULa7a3OdsF
@kemilligan Would love to go back there! Race Gloucester GP a few times as a junior &amp; u23 back when I thought I was going to be a CX super star!
@_IsaacKing @taylorphinney I think you misspelled handsome.
@riika_l Nothing wrong with the office job. Just like to work on site from time to time. You know, go to the people.
@rusty_woods @davidefrattini @nealrogers Hahahahhaha! Woodsy if you ever run 26.2 miles you know I'm going to have to go out the next day and run 27.2!
@juliankyer Think I can get @UranRigoberto and @sepvanmarcke to stain my deck as long as we add a gravel section? That gravel section can be adding a walk way to my front door.
@iambruts https://t.co/LP5mFj1ueP But more realistically speaking @CapeEpic or something like @DirtyKanza200 would be a ton of fun.
@ryanAjoyce @AthensTwilight Can I ride with lights?
@sholomjaeger @Redhookcrit That might be more of a @taylorphinney thang but I'll give it a try or five.
@JoeFultano @rapha Then you'll rule the world!
“The team will flip the script on the calendar ... fixed gear criteriums, ultra-endurance races, and mixed-terrain events.” SIGN ME UP!

Big final attack from @UranRigoberto at the #GiroEmilia today. With his second and @rusty_woods in 4th, @Ride_Argyle is looking ripping strong for #IlLombardia!

@LukeRowe1990 @chrisfroome @cpacycling The thing @cpacycling does not understand is that it’s our (the riders) union, not a lunch club. They are supposed to be working for us.
@RobinmCarpenter Service manual, YouTube and give it a good test before you get on the highway
My favorite part about the OTTO lock from @OTTODesignWorks? It works like a zip tie. No bike lock? No problem. HOWES18 for a discount! https://t.co/NXi9yvVGfi
@bugnogianni1 @cpacycling @marcelkittel @millarforcpa @paulvoss86 Probably because it’s expensive, time consuming and extremely complicated to create a nation member that can be accepted into the CPA.
@tomsoutham @Mamnick 43% did

@rusty_woods @TourofUtah @Ride_Argyle That’s my boy ❤️
There are a lot of great ways to save money. @SouthwestAir is not one of them. #obigatoryairlinehatetweet #notworthit #bottomofthebarrel
@Pflax1 Don’t forget talented, hardworking, tenacious and oblivious to risk.
@TourofUtah And I wouldn’t have made it through without all the love from the fans. Heard my name so many times. Thank you Utah. I’ll be back. ❤️❤️❤️
DNS stage 7 of @TourofUtah. Hard decision &amp; the 1st race I’ve quit in over 3 years, but I’ve never suffered like I suffered yesterday.
@JoeFultano Bad call😬
@DoyerBlues Helped a million. Really. Maybe two million. Thank you.
@Jeffreyalan74 @TourofUtah @Ride_Argyle @cannondalePro Thanks Jeff. That pic right there perfectly sums up my @TourofUtah this year. Back to the drawing board.
You have all Sunday to create 997 fake email addresses &amp; use them all to vote for @natebrown0707. Best get started. https://t.co/Fiwdoxv7dY
@iamseanslack Sure did! Thanks for the support out there! I needed it!
Kisses to all those who voted for me today in the fan favorite comp here @TourofUtah. If you didn’t vote for me, kisses to you too. 😘 https://t.co/9c4YN7pnxY
Best sprinter?!?! I’m 61 kilos! No way I’m winning this one. https://t.co/QRBNlOtoXL
@peterstetina Nooooooooo
@philgaimon That’s because they spent all their money. If the would have kept most of the money &amp; bought a bike they’d be much happier.
@Pflax1 Not surprised

@Pflax1 Love the shame free shorts.
@danodep Dan!
@rusty_woods @Ride_Argyle I think the new tariffs require me to work 25% harder for all Canadian imports.
@PuckBuddys That hashtag 😂😂😂
@JoeFultano Wasn't me but @Kielreijnen is in town...
If you’re like me and you like to get rowdy in distant lands the new inReach Mini from @Garmin is a must have 😍😍 https://t.co/nuDK1Q5gmh
Willing to bet Kristoff would have won that sprint had he had a more aero bike.
@freddreier 19 days of cobbles plus one mountain stage and a parade.
@Pflax1 Also remember that every single pro has most likely had multiple crashes that would have 99% of recreational cyclist posing their bike on Craigslist.
@philgaimon This tweet sucks.
Just now watching the final of today’s @LeTour stage... WOW! That final sprint by @johndegenkolb was absolutely SAVAGE! Chapeau!
@Gotta_B_Carbon @nealrogers A true captain stays with the ship all the way down.

@loquilloarkaitz @ehitzulia We usually get home as quickly as possible anyway we can. We live all over Europe so no sharing airplanes. Thanks for the chocolate offer!
@reddogma1 @philgaimon Shoe covers and thick neoprene gloves help a lot. But oftentimes you just grit your teeth &amp; pedal harder.

@synthsis What can I say? I love moose and bears and nice folks.
@sandstone91 This 360,000 was from the spring until mid July! It's only gotten worse since then.
@shawnmckean Absolutely jaw dropping. WOW
By mid October this might be all I can handle! https://t.co/2VQVDseozY
Does anyone have a current # on the amount of BC burned so far? Best I can find is 360k hectares up until mid July. Absolutely tragic.
Ooof, all that smoke blowing in from the BC forest fires is killing my lungs &amp; killing my @JasperNP views. Guess I'll have to come back!
