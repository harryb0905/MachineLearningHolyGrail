@davegerhardt Wait until you get to your 40's and start getting deep into the math of making private jets work.
@mmay3r I would say a robust sense to punish. Justice can be fair. Toxic people care only about inflicting harm.,
@DaveRabin @keenzai @apollonysis @rael_cahn Happy to talk. Email is tucker@scribemedia.com
@DaveRabin @keenzai I've done two more treatments since I wrote that. Totally life changing.
@JoeyC1897 Fuck, ok thanks
@dcancel @CameronHerold I'm in. Just tell me when and where
@dcancel David do you know @CameronHerold? You'd like him a lot. He's a great speaker too, would be cool to have at an event
Control freaks want to control everything but the one thing they can control—themselves.
@JordanHarbinger @theunixwizard @vivekt17 If I remember the piece, my advice was literally to run as fast as you can in a straight line. Thats it. Now go do it.
@EricJorgenson I'm not sure id make the point, bc it misses a fundamental truth: no one buys information. They think they are buying a result. In diet space most are buying guilt reduction
@EricJorgenson If you think they are selling information, you don't understand marketing at all
@clayhebert I forgot I told you that. Shit man, it's almost like I know what I'm talking about
@cadredc @adamlevitan Thanks Derek, Adam, happy to help if you need it
@cseline Not for me
I guess it was only a matter of time: https://t.co/w8ndxdzaC1
This is the perfect tweet to end 2018. I'm in awe. https://t.co/9JZzzjHH3k
"Every little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit." -Philip Pullman
@kpereau My pleasure. Glad to help
@zaoyang You are dead on with the drugs treating PTSD, but it will mainly be MDMA, which is not a psychedelic (though psychedelics will very important for other things). I wrote a big piece about this: https://t.co/yWY2Sii2qj
If You Want to Write A Great Book, Hire A Great Scribe via @forbes https://t.co/xhiXhdkmuO
@johnrobb I'll buy that right now
@farnamstreet Actually, it was over 200, but not 200 consecutive
@farnamstreet You missed one. I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell was on for more than 175 weeks.
@tonystubblebine @tferriss I know all about him. Even my wife likes having him over for dinner, and she barely likes anyone :)
@tonystubblebine @tferriss lol, I have nearly the same graph. A FF link from @tferriss drives serious traffic https://t.co/7qUbqdm0UE
@DuffThePsych tucker@scribemedia.com
@DuffThePsych Yeah, happy to come on. Send me a scheduling link
If you don't know about @davidgoggins book, don't say I didn't tell you:  https://t.co/JEV2j3EQ3x
@omarfguzman @joerogan @davidgoggins @scribemediaco Yes we did. And the book is AWESOME. @davidgoggins is amazing.
@NaithanJones When this came out, I actually tried vodka and milk to see what it was like. It was a poor choice on my part.
@davegerhardt You've been to Wizard Academy right? Amazing place, not to mention Roy
@scottbelsky Or, the far more likely explanation--hypocrisy is human nature. Social media is just an avenue to display who we really are as a species.
I did MDMA therapy (twice), and this is what it was like: https://t.co/yWY2Sii2qj
@mmay3r I mean--either they are citizens or they are not. We don't grant citizenship on a curve.
@BrianRoemmele This is amazing. You should do a book on this
@ncastro878 Not really
@ncastro878 Everything is learnable. Except height and penis size
@joshwclement Of course.
@joshwclement Has human biology changed in the last 5 years?
@johnrobb Yeah, that meme will be big. You can tell it's impactful, just by the authoritarian left immune response--Twitter is banning NPC meme accounts
@angjiang So true. I wish I knew this when I was younger.
@meganeflanagan @charliehoehn I started a company instead. Far more productive: https://t.co/HK8wAvSWUb
@johnrobb Such a good meme. Takes Ted kaczynski's "oversocialization" idea and makes it shareable
@thatsTaylor I sold 1.5 million copies of that book. It still sells 5k copies a week. You on the other hand... Not so much
@michaelmalice That is deeply offensive. I would NEVER go to a Nationals game, much less buy season tickets
@EvokingGenius @MarkEbner59 I could never be Pope. I am very strongly against sexual abuse of children. And UN is out too. I only speak English, and I actually like to accomplish things.
@WestonMHayes @chad_westby You and jt
@MarkEbner59 @NightAndDay24_7 See that's a Devils threesome. Very different than devil triangle, which actually is a drinking game
@MarkEbner59 Come on man. I wouldve done way better at my confirmation hearings
@chad_westby The one who works for me?
@hughcards @dsearls Ain't that the truest shit ever
@LawyerGirlMiami I would phrase that a different way. I think the difference is values; the lens through which they process, evaluate and act on information.
@KapilGuptaMD @realjtmccormick Thank you.
@LlCashJ @realjtmccormick Yep: https://t.co/MW9biOzt7D
My company just #1 in the Entrepreneur Top Company Cultures: https://t.co/lh98setnKw  I blame @realjtmccormick
@nntaleb If he understood that he wouldn't be a financial Journalist. Hed go make money
@micah Ask yourself, "What would I do if I was planning the future for someone I deeply loved? What decisions would I make to maximize their life?"  Then do them for yourself
@Pv You left out the crash. Had a profound effect on all aspects of the internet
@GRITCULT Someone I follow retweeted
@Clint_Collins_ Considering I retired at the end of the third one, no probably not.
@micah Isn't it the best when you dog meditates with you? https://t.co/ZSW57P2N1E
@Aella_Girl Start here. Big rabbit hole to go into: https://t.co/xY8Ykj3z7Q
@Aella_Girl Probably because it's true. Lots of data on this actually, just doesn't get talked about
@Pv @CaseyA That isn't even close to peak hipster. They still have straws
@MartyMacisso @ShaneMac hahahaha--you obviously don't know who I am
@ShaneMac You've never bought a house.
@DEG1818 I'm a writer not a speller
Austin Business Journal did a front page write up about Scribe and our culture. PS--were hiring: https://t.co/K8drzCVHHP
@normonics @nntaleb Poverty pimp
@hughcards And we are about to take @JoePolish book out to publishers
@hughcards @CameronHerold is about to finish his third book...
@hughcards lol I would love if you illustrated a book we did. That would be awesome. The problem will be getting authors to pay for your illustrations
@pt Well, don't want to sound trollish, but how do you know they want to serve, as opposed to wield power?
@pt The problem is the very very few politicians dedicate their lives to public service. They dedicate it to public power. Very different.
@nickgraynews @zachobront Thanks man
@johnrobb I wish I could predict
@johnrobb You see this? https://t.co/Wgx1W1X7eZ
@IAmAdamRobinson So when we hanging out 😆😆🤣
@normonics Can you explain more? Or point me where to dive in?
@BunnyBlog Edward Bernays. You've seen this, right: https://t.co/c9fzkOrM4P  BBC documentary about the grand nephew of Freud, the guy who invented modern consumerist marketing
@KatherineHyp @TiffanyHaddish But will the flowers have bugs in them?
@charliehoehn @BunnyBlog This is an amazing idea.
@nntaleb @davidgraeber No votes for journalist?
@StretchMcLurch @nntaleb I will do my best to persuade nnt to put a deadlifting tutorial in the book. But he is his own man. No guarantees.
@Toledo_Torpedo_ We've done about 800.
@then_there_was ugh--CLIMB the status hierarchy. Not find. Stupid autocorrect
@then_there_was I don't think warfare is the right frame. Men seek to find the status hierarchy. That can often lead to actual war.
@ShaneMac @david_perell Yeah see--that is where you can go sideways. Trying to understand WHY they want to hang a picture is VERY dicey. But getting to "they want to hang a picture" is doable
@david_perell NO one wants to buy a hole either. What why they want is to hang a picture.
@WhiteBoyTheNine COol, just sent my scheduler via DM
@DennisPrager The NY Times admits--in court cases--that their list is an editorial product. I am betting the current staff doesn't even know this: https://t.co/AfRu5Cr09T
This is a brilliant example of how to use a book to create a media frenzy around your company and idea: https://t.co/E9AMj2GPxY
@Pv And have the wives set up a dinner. Come to our house, week break out the nice wine
@Pv Lol if it was a real humblebrag we'd be able to leave because we'd be doing so well we could hire people to replace us.
@Pv No Europe this summer. Hers and my companies growing too fast, can't leave for even a week
@Pv Completely disagree. If this is the case, it means you aren't spending enough time thinking about what youre trying to accomplish, who your audience is, and why theyll care. Prob means your writing is more about you, not reader
Lots of people have asked me about using a ghostwriter to help with their books, so I wrote up a comprehensive guide: https://t.co/h3tXj5e8aD
@JeffyChamp Lots about him in the next two books
@EricJorgenson Desire to signal is never counterproductive. You might think the signal itself is counterproductive, but then again, you are probably not the audience. Birds don't sing for us.
@EricJorgenson Not at all. You just signal in a much higher status different way. This is a class difference.
@ShawnGarrett We have a much lower price coaching service we just launched, it might be better for you. But it requires more work on your part: https://t.co/daMy7vwrjF
@ShawnGarrett Have you set up a call with my team? This is what we do, we're happy to help you walk through what you're looking for and the best way to get it.
@ShawnGarrett When you say "nothing will become of it" what do you mean? No one will read it? Or it won't generate a return for you?
Everyone thinks they want a bestseller--but it’s actually a bad idea, and I explain why here: https://t.co/EkOrcMqXrM
@JayBilas I know right? Writers are the WORST
@cgreinerbechert @tomfgoodwin @bookinaboxco Yeah Tom, I have a podcast just about books. Happy to have you on to talk about the book writing process. Email me: tucker@bookinabox.com, or DM me your email
@EricEdmeades No link!
Bob Glazer used his book to not only raise the profile of his industry, but get on Dr. Oz as well: https://t.co/UFvI92dI3i
@farnamstreet @morganhousel Yeah, Morgan is right on this for himself (and me, I would love no intro), but wrong for a most everyone else. This is a great example of smart/specialist people not being the best test audience when asking what works for a general audience.
@punkymilkshakes My kid is obsessed with that lego contraption
John Ruhlin used his book to become THE expert in corporate gifting, and now speaks all over the country about his niche. Check out how he did it: https://t.co/QFeoYAG7UY
Having trouble figuring out if you really have a book in you? Or if anyone will care about your book? There's a very simple but powerful test to determine if you have a book in you: https://t.co/gQTGumvOOc

@ShaneMac @Mkt_Hacker @HYP3R @socialnerdia @jtolks @chrislately @NicklausSalzman @iamdanmoriarty @LiatBycel @ToMartha I live in a 7k sq ft house in suburbs now. Kids man...
You know you have a book in you, and you know you should write it. But you just can't seem to get it done. Why not?  Fear.   Learn what your fears are and how to get past them: https://t.co/1sCXdSm2HH
@AlecMAndersen This is correct
@Pv @erickoester It gets worse. At this marketing conference I had a young girl tell me I was her dad's favorite author
@Pv @erickoester You are not woke enough for a meme war https://t.co/21J16JBtsq
@erickoester @Pv And because I know you are humor-impaired, lemme give you your response to that tweet:   "If we are doing a RusselL Crowe spelling bee, you are losing."
@erickoester @Pv If we are doing Russel Crowe memes, you are losing. https://t.co/M8RGALrXgb
@erickoester @Pv Keep making fun of me. I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next!!! https://t.co/Nr4CuoqLdl
@Pv Lol. Dude I went ballistic when I saw that picture. My team got angry Tucker
If you're trying to raise your profile and establish yourself in your field—do you know what steps to take? How do you get the visibility you need to advance your career?   You write a book.   I explain how this works: https://t.co/GGCPnRwRAk https://t.co/qSO7XgQ7zf
@Pv @patio11 Yep. Working very well: https://t.co/4bO7LkIVzc
If you want to write a book, you need to know how it will make you money...and books sales is NOT the answer. This piece explains: https://t.co/6uxCV7CsvC https://t.co/bEYYPOPdpp
@PaulJarrett @s_jarrett I hope your wife can do more for you than I can today
For most authors, selling books is the worst way to make money from a book. How could that be? I explain everything here: https://t.co/LDZSojEHge https://t.co/CQTUgyUj5Z
If you want to do more speaking, there's a great way to get there: writing a book. See how 7 different entrepreneurs used a book to get on stages around the world: https://t.co/v9YFQ544cE
@RealCDurks @RubinReport @BretWeinstein @Mike_Dillard I also explain fully here: https://t.co/AfRu5Cr09T
@laurapennino @TiffanyHaddish Glad you liked it, her book was easy, she is a comedic genius. We've done hundreds of books, but hers is one of the very best
@IAmAdamRobinson Agreed, I doubt there is one using that word, that's a modern word. Having an open heart though, lots of immortals talked about. Greeks all over that one. But yes, modern version of vulnerability is not always about this
@IAmAdamRobinson I can actually think of some that were very vulnerable, though not perhaps in the sense you are talking about: Cyrus The Great. Buddha. Joan of Arc. Jesus Christ. Miyamoto Musashi.
@EricRWeinstein @BretWeinstein @jordanbpeterson @SamHarrisOrg @benshapiro @OwenBenjamin If only you had another way to express these ideas...like a podcast 😁
@mmay3r @BenedictEvans Yes actually
@EricRWeinstein Dude---you gotta start a pod cast. You have more to say than Twitter can hold. Please
@StephenFoung I'm confused--that question has a 9 by it, but you say question 7.
@tim_fargo The "guy playing guitar at a party" is by definition a douche in American culture, hence the comment paired with the picture. It's a joke dude.
And I've never been the douche playing guitar at a party for this exact reason: I could never live with myself if I passed that on to my son https://t.co/mrDLJAZpzO
@hnshah If you can be an expert in a few Google searches, its not actual expertise. Its easy to feel like an expert, its not easy to develop the expertise that comes from lots of experience. That takes reps.
This is probably the best interview I've ever done. Tom @TomBilyeu is a great interviewer, he got the best out of me. https://t.co/A8cO0SwDm0
@acaciarojokidd @NilsAParker @jordanbpeterson @JamesADamore It looks like people fucking with algo--Bing &amp; DuckDuckGo also return somewhat similar results
@acaciarojokidd @NilsAParker @jordanbpeterson @JamesADamore ahahahhahah--that is insane. Is Google doing that on purpose, or are other people fucking with the algo?
@Brigadirk @jordanbpeterson @JamesADamore I just did it with American Scientists, and Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google are all very much the same--tons of pictures of Ben Carson Lewis Lattimer and George Washington Carver. Though Google also adds in Obama, lol
@NilsAParker Oh yeah. I guess there are few plus sized in Google, and a I guess a few mixed race of some sort that aren't in the others. But I had to look to notice this, it wasn't obvious. I was looking at hotness
@tmrob_ @jordanbpeterson @JamesADamore Which would be what?
@jordanbpeterson @JamesADamore I just did that and the images seemed very similar to me between sites. Am I missing something?
@donaldmiller @JJPeterson75 lol same. I haven't seen a new years come in for four years. It's awesome
@CameronHerold @MichelFalcon I'm excited to work with you. Welcome aboard @MichelFalcon
@Hilomh Yep. https://t.co/xDv2AuQ29g
@Hilomh Its awesome.
@johndurant Also WMDs in Iraq. And the Jayson Blair stories.
Watch this interview with Tiffany Haddish on The Daily Show [NOTE: The book is even better than the interview]:  https://t.co/9GiwsJ4mAO
@EricJorgenson @nbashaw @KevinSimler @robinhanson Eric, you should read this book. I got an early copy and even blurbed it. Its AWESOME
My first new book of short stories in years is out:      https://t.co/5ENTi0YslH  No, I did not transition to become a black woman (that would be quite the story wouldn't it?). I was the co-writer for Tiffany Haddish's book. Its amazing, read it. https://t.co/bkRluBl4HP
Entire books could be written about this, and our kids will be shocked that we did not internalize it sooner https://t.co/UWM1WmwCrD
@charliehoehn @NakedWinesCOM I get what they are saying, its not wrong, but its also not really fully accurate. $20 can be seen as raw fixed cost of processing grapes. But to say thats only cost is just wrong, neglects yields, farming methods, etc.
@TrevMcKendrick Have you read it? It's the book that had the biggest impact on my writing style, along with Fight Club and PJ O'Rourke
@teashopgirl Yes, get on the freelancer email list, and you'll get a notification as soon as we open it up
This is one of the funniest things I have ever read. If this is true, it is the perfect summary of the 21st century https://t.co/rbPVLQKDLf
@medoane @bookinaboxco Email me tucker@bookinabox.com, we'll set up a time to talk
@medoane @bookinaboxco That is impressive effort. Email brittany@bookinabox.com, ask her. She runs the process. I dont see people until final interviews, up to her
@brian_armstrong @iam_preethi Good thread, but missed big tactic: strong relationships with people that matter to you in real life. Makes haters irrelevant
@jordanbpeterson I cannot recommend enough that YOU do it. Your audience wants to hear your voice, not an actor. I did it with my books, was a huge benefit
@dcurtis Oh my god. Thats terrible.
@Pv @fortelabs @jnadms It did exist 30 years ago. Now, nothing. Complete myth.
@fortelabs But short answer why most people do it is social signaling. They want to feel accepted by "important" ppl and see trad pub as the route
@fortelabs Only big celebs and professional writers should do traditional. Long post about this, lots of details: https://t.co/72Rb8LvcSD
@VossNegotiation email is tucker@bookinabox.com thanks so much man, awesome conversation
@nntaleb Next time I come to NYC, you gotta wear those when we deadlift
@vincebelpiede @hustlecon Here you go: https://t.co/TZHuVc6rAq
@mtracey I trust @JJWatt much more than the Red Cross or other "charities" that have 70%+ admin costs
@joshwclement Not a metaphor, that is literally what it is
@joshsharpx I literally talk about it in the podcast. Therapy, meditation, etc. Its all in there
@erickoester No idea. I do know that it's better to keep it privately held though.
@erickoester Eric, you know me pretty well. How do you think I'd do taking orders from "shareholders"?
@ShaneMac No. He's not even on Facebook. Dude is a Luddite.
@erickoester IPO?!?? You are lost in the wrong model. No VC, no debt, nothing. We building a profitable business, not a cow for Wall Street to suck dry.
@ShaneMac JT started 18 months ago. We are turned around now, shit's going great.
@ShaneMac The funny thing is that happened like, 18 months ago.
Why firing himself as CEO was the best thing Tucker Max ever did for his start-up https://t.co/4nhrAkeucf
@ohkamar @primalpoly We did not. The publisher did that.
@TaylorPearsonMe The thing excludes itself. Cant be non-tribal and SJW or Alt-Right, or any tribe. Purpose of tribe is to beat other tribes
@ShaneMac @bfeld Agreed. Thats one. I can think of maybe 3 or 4 more. That's it.
@ShaneMac How many VC do you know who even begin to know where to start with mental health?
@johndurant Cholula? DUDE--Franks Red Hot is the ONLY acceptable North American hot sauce.
@nevezarmando @unfinishthought The Masters of Rome series taught me more about the psychological dynamics of power than anything I've ever read: https://t.co/318i9SCRw4
@unfinishthought Good fiction is better than any non-fiction at explaining the inner lives of people not like yourself. Or understanding your own.
@topherPedersen We were. You missed the deadline
@TaylorPearsonMe You dont manage that emotion. The emotion is the problem.
@TaylorPearsonMe No dude. If you feel like you're going to die THAT is the prob. Bjj &amp; ent req you to separate identity from result. Like Buddhism
@VossNegotiation @binmansguide No man, I already read it. Twice. And bought copies for half my company.
@VossNegotiation @binmansguide How's exactly would I do that 😀
@micah It is. If you've had pain in your life, being vulnerable about it will make other people cry. It's a good sign your therapist cares
@micah Not true. I did that many times.
@mhartl @nntaleb You are criminally native if you think that
@nntaleb What about university administrators? They can be even more clueless than journos, and even thrive
@MarielleBriant @Hustle_Says Thank you, but you can't apprentice remotely. Can't learn like that.
We are hiring again, a perfect job for an entry level marketing person: https://t.co/pUZrJ8CLiu
@alxberman @hustlecon Already? Or before you heard the speech?
@DamianOcean You left out status.
@normonics @nntaleb @untrueandnew Isn't Nassims twitter the best? Its the only value I can see from stupid people--they get Nassim to post amazing comments
@BIABHireMe @zachobront @bookinaboxco Yes. Apprentice role opening up soon
@donaldmiller @BenMalcolmson That's very good. Writing is about the audience not the writer. Even with memoirs like ours
@1738Jordan not true. I have a wine cellar in my house
@1738Jordan The chance is zero percent.
@fortelabs I used it last week
@fortelabs Clippings.io
@normonics @nntaleb Joe, I'm curious at to why? I love it too, but what about it been a game changer for you?
@ktalbotmurph I have a weird feeling that you might not telling the truth about this.
@GerberRob @rogerdooley @90MinuteBooks @ilmpodcast Rob, I was actually on the I Love Marketing podcast with Joe and Dean. Did you miss that episode?
@ShaneMac What dates?
@nntaleb @habibwicks Both are great. I'll be in Boulder in August
@nntaleb Not at all. St Julien is by far best hotel. Really nice, walkable to everything
@DonWettrick yeah man, just email me: tucker@bookinabox.com
@nntaleb Nassim, you'd like Boulder. I have friends there you would like to if you want me to connect
@donaldmiller Coming to Nashville in July. You around? Love to catch up, email is easiest: tucker@bookinabox.com
@noahkagan @KSimback You go to the Golds downtown? My god. Oh no.
@KSimback @noahkagan Travis county strength.
@DrJoeHanson I think the phrase applies to people who get teaching jobs. Those who teach in a way that has to compete in the market--that is hard
@normonics @naval He doesn't mean "qualified." What he is really saying is "one of us." That tweet is PURE tribal signaling
@DamianOcean Great studies about this. Ppl would rather shock selves W/electricity then be alone with their thoughts
@DamianOcean They aren't afraid of boredom. They're afraid of the unpleasant thoughts they don't want to face
@ShafiqDe Yep. All of this is coming. There no safe places or industries, only safe people
How a college professor decided to stop lecturing and help students write and publish books. Amazing story, I highly recommend https://t.co/rs6TrgsuUz
@tbohen That WAS a great call, wasn't it?
@nntaleb There actually is ONE machine that can: the Versaclimber. That thing shreds people. But yes, the rest are nonsense.
@JimsBrainBox Is that a joke?
@matthewstoller Best way to break up big airlines is remove massive barriers to small jet competition. All first class flyers will shift right away
@matthewstoller The idea that flying is deregulated is a joke. Try to start a private jet company, and see what the FAA lets you do with that.
@RealKimSpencer Textio
@unfinishthought Yep. Because they aren't talking about facts or ideas. They are tribal signaling
@erickoester @ShaneMac if only there was a way to write without being able to type :) dude please get well. We have a date April 25th
@unfinishthought shit--I mistyped. The word "not" should be "now." Totally changes the tweet. But yes, I agree w/you--an identity issue.
@unfinishthought Vaxxing is not an identity issue. Like climate change or equality. Facts dont matter anymore
@scottbelsky All depends on what you mean by lazy: https://t.co/qGYVsatQp8
@joshwclement No. Thats almost never a problem for people who are otherwise healthy. If it is, go see a cardiologist
@andrewett @sacca We'd love to work with you Chris. We know a ton of people in common
@PatCDev Who?
@djmicrobeads @mmay3r @naval Dont you ever insult me by calling me a journalist. I can think for myself.
@mmay3r @naval Hey! How else will people know I'm important and cool!! :)
@hughcards lol

@ShaneMac Oh god. You just described editorial hell.
@ShaneMac The problem is editing. A lot of people have tried this, and that prob has never been solved
@ShaneMac Then miss out on the best example of what youre talking about
@ShaneMac Go buy my book, Hilarity Ensues. I have a TON of stories in there that are this exact thing.
@Amy_Writes_Book solid. A bit fuzzy and washed out, but good pose and smile
@erickoester all three of @nntaleb books. Very dense. If anything too short.
@ahappygirlcom @bookinaboxco Thank you. Good luck in the application process
@AmuseChimp I wish I understood this at 18
@Shamrock8095 Yes, we just launched the "publish only" division. We're the high quality, high cost option though--6k
@MarkAmesExiled now you understand the role of religion and scapegoats in human evolution
@MuditBhutani @mmay3r lol. No one formally in school. Everyone who knows how learned by doing
@mmay3r because b-schools dont teach entrepreneurship. They teach management
@hughcards Sadly, I think he's not going anywhere. He is inside the OODA loops of any opposition. Way ahead of them
@hughcards They dont need to support him. He's president.
@vivekt17 that's wrong. You don't understand tradeoffs, nor does he
@KierMellour @bookinaboxco Of course
@Erik_Cunningham What the fuck do you think an iphone is?
@andrewett we've got other things coming if that's not interesting to you. Tucker@bookinabox.com
@andrewett were hiring. This is sort of a biz dev role: https://t.co/bRDqQUh99O
Created a supercomputer so powerful 3 billion people communicate instantly w/each other. Youre using it to make your nonsense point https://t.co/B22lL5TWR8
@Chris_arnade The reasons WHY progressives have stopped doing that is why the US is going to break into smaller semi-autonomous units
@kyleschen @EricRWeinstein not sure that's true. Language is vehicle for tribalism. Not cause
@EricRWeinstein 4/and only then, if ever, do you get to "What are the underlying facts?"
@EricRWeinstein 3/then "how do varying opinions reflect on my status relative to this Tribe," to increase or affirm status w/in tribe
@EricRWeinstein 2/Hierarchy for most people is "what does my Tribe think about this subject overall?"--tribe always comes first.
@EricRWeinstein 1/ I think Russell Conjugation misses larger issue: what social structures do humans use to process information?
@Pv @johndurant Bruce Willis just plays Bruce Willis. Very few can play other people--Daniel Day Lewis for example can.
@LogRobs It was even better in person. Legit top 5 moment of my life
@johndurant THIS IS NEWS TO YOU!!??! Theres a reason Hitchcock said "Actors are cattle."
@EricJorgenson @mungerisms go check @nntaleb timeline. He links it awhile ago
@EricJorgenson @mungerisms They only connect in a metaphorical sense, not actually. Taleb crushed Pinker on similar misuse of 2nd law
@ShaneMac @rstephens @grapeswithaview I had multiple stories in my last book that were all screenshots, essentially. Could be awesome.
@ShaneMac Other way to change mind: Force yourself to explain WHY you believe what you believe + ask the 5 Whys: https://t.co/eUOze2AWei
@ShaneMac Easy: force yourself to argue the other side as if you believed it. What are their BEST arguments?
@shloky That is CLEARLY just a list of private VC backed tech companies.
@nbashaw @rsg You're assuming that D &amp; R are truly different tribes. Maybe constituents. Not leaders. Both captured by the same uber tribe
@nbashaw @rsg you're telling yourself a story so you can feel good about your tribe and its identity
@nbashaw @rsg Exactly my point--those are binary. Politics is about tribalism, ingroup vs outgroup, nuance is a smokescreen
@nbashaw @rsg Nathan that is 20 years of data! Doesnt look like that when stretched over 200 years. Humans have been tribal forever
@nbashaw @rsg uhhh--not even close. Maybe the 50s. Most of american political history is VERY violent and chaotic. Google Boss Tweed
@rsg You ever think maybe the reverse is true? That we never really had nuance, it was all tribal status signaling, and twitter exposed that
@MrMikeSmith Yes--BUT we are in need of more talented people. We have so much opportunity, not enough great people.
@maxlugavere email is easy Tucker@bookinabox.com
@FryMcCain Is it hard, to be as sad and lonely as you are? I imagine it is.
@johndurant @FryMcCain I'm trying to get there. One day
@johndurant @FryMcCain yep. Time most influencial list = only infamous. Makes sense. Thanks
@FryMcCain @johndurant lol yeah you're right. My fame is just in my own mind. No one knows who I am
@nntaleb results oriented vs signaling oriented
@johndurant As one, I would argue causation is other way. People with mental health issues are draw to being a celeb
@Pv @johndurant and he was such a pussy!!!!
@nntaleb @karimbitar in fact Jesus spent most of the Bible preaching against those exact people.
@DavidHenderson @BoomerCafe of course. Please Do.
@dcurtis Veronica and I really like it, up until that last episode. It felt like it went off the rails.
@pcourtneyldn I have no idea who that is or what it's about
@realjtmccormick You don't have any tweets. How will people know your opinions if you dont blast them publicly?!??!?
@joshwclement oh yes. Seen it.
@EricRWeinstein @nntaleb I bet Nassim says that none have written it because no economist has it. If they FUM, they wouldnt be economists
@jeetchokshi yes. We already have it in beta. 10 current clients. Roll out in January
@AmuseChimp Mostly, they buy the books, and say they read them
@johndurant I for one love it. It means they are already suppressing the AltRight shills   :)
@joshwclement maybe. Depends
@Pv First thing we do, give them a copy of your book :)
My company is hiring an apprentice. Basically an intern, better paid with mentoring and advancement  https://t.co/4TdD3JWM3N
@EricRWeinstein @nntaleb Yep. Known Nassim for ~4 years, he's one of the most stand-up humans I know. A model for others.
@farnamstreet We're in that range, whats up? You got my email right?
@donaldmiller Big fan of your books, especially Father Fiction. So good. My mother in law lives in Nashville, will def reach out
@BobbyFuchs Is there a percentage lower than zero? It would be that.
@nrafreedom2 That's only the intro to the good stuff in the other three books
@jmj @ShaneMac happy to help. Email me well set it up: tucker@bookinabox.com
@garrytan you still here or you leave?
@roybahat @bencasnocha I saw them. Your idea of fairness assumes same starting spots. Thats fairytale fairness, and ultimately zero sum
@roybahat @bencasnocha There it is--you see any advantage as prima facie disadvantage to others. Zero sum mindset. Not judging, just a fact
@roybahat @bencasnocha Saying there is a contradiction between "fair shot" and passing on success to kids
@roybahat @bencasnocha you are assuming that someones success trades off with anothers. That there is only a set amount of wealth to be had
@BuckyIsotope He would've made many other throws Dak isn't making as well, like game ending interceptions
@nntaleb @hughcards and do a full power clean to get it to your chest before pressing it
@EasyJizzle you chose law school. You chose poorly
@EasyJizzle that is correct. It is my fault.
@ericjwbauer @AlexCharfen Definitely, super nice to meet you
@AmersR not even close. Tons of women book clubs have read my book
@meganjeannn17 wife, actually. And another kid on the way.
If you want to understand the current state of American politics, this is the clearest explanation https://t.co/l57asZfHtJ
@delcecato @realDonaldTrump Seriously though. It has gotten 10x worse from when I said that like, 5 months ago.
@Pv @johndurant I've been. It's solid, but the food is not great yet. They need a real chef.
@ShaneMac @micah @tmcleod3 @AndrewWarner Also in town Nov 13, 14, 15
@ShaneMac @micah @tmcleod3 Nov 1st? I'll be in Nov
@micah @BeOmni @tmcleod3 daaaaamn! Bold praise!
@micah @BeOmni I visited them and talked to Ryan about the vision. Great company. They could be fucking huge.
@shloky They are just chatbots right now that ask questions. Flower ordering, reservation changes, etc.
@shloky I know the team behind Assist.io really well, they are doing great with big corporate clients. Not my company though
@marshallk @IFTTT @Pocket how do you do this? Is there a tutorial anywhere?
@RadDeviant @bookinaboxco Thats the ultimate goal. But one step at a time. Many problems to solve to get to that one
@RadDeviant @bookinaboxco We wont be doing mobile first. People still write by typing, but well move to mobile eventually
@RadDeviant @bookinaboxco were working on it right now. Why?
@ReformedBroker Been doing this for my whole life. Works great, feels great. Welcome to the club!
Why You Need to Write A Book (And How to Actually Get it Done) (great piece @chrisdessi)  https://t.co/DQkq5XPZlm via @Inc
@JamesCurrier We're building a company in that space, but I wonder how well the principles apply to books and identity based media.
@JamesCurrier Hey man, you done anymore writing on the market-network idea since your TC piece last year? Read anything else interesting?
If you are an entrepreneur, you (probably) need to have a book. This is why:  https://t.co/3tkFDEuL84

@rowesk @EricRWeinstein @nntaleb It was advice for me, wouldn't be applicable to you
@EricRWeinstein @nntaleb I've learned to listen very closely to Nassim, and follow any advice he gives me. Works very well :)
@jackbremer @garyvee No, but there was a movie. Its on Netflix
@TiffanyHaddish So great talking to you. If anyone pisses me off this week, I'm going to tell them their pussy is garbage

@wilfob yeah dude great playing w you to. My mother in law lives in Nashville were there a lot. Will hit you up
@azeem are you building this? We'd be happy to be a beta customer. We transcribe hundreds of hours, sometimes thousands per month
@azeem only issue is quality. Doesn't need to be 100% perfect. But needs good reliability
@azeem that's 1$ a minute. $10an hire would be huge price break
@azeem hell yes. We pay $a minute now for human powered.
@azeem my company uses transcription a lot, theres no effective service like this
@garethjenkin yep

@ShaneMac great piece but he misses other way to create change: build a new system
@kellyhclay that had to be a boring college 😀
@JohnKounios @kadavy Seth was a good friend to meet as well. I miss him every day
@nbashaw That doesn't mean it's better. It means it got more reaction from the types of people who react. Not the same thing.
@nbashaw Basically, that the only people emailing you are the ones who have positive things to say. Gives distorted view of the situation
@nbashaw Go read up on two things: "Adverse selection" and "revealed preferences."

@micah LOL, Bishop is down, especially if you have french fries. We're around all day, just lemme know.
@micah were here. Happy to
@robinhanson 80-90% at least. They usually aren't even wrong--they are so far off, they aren't even right or wrong
@eriktorenberg that has a name. Therapy.
@ImNotRio @kadavy the hidden curriculum by David kashmer
@paulg it's avoidance. Usually of negative emotions
@Mollydactyl @SryAboutLastNyt I'd go on, of course
@TheLeanMusician Its on Amazon and our site
@TravisDailey @farnamstreet Agreed
@NilsAParker So you're saying he's just like all other people from Boston?
@ShaneMac @JakeSurfs you left it a mess Shane we had to use the living room
@shervin @pmarca actually not true. Think And Grow Rich, and How To Win Friends And Influence People best sellers of 20th centurt
@johndurant I hope you'be read the whole Thomas Sowell series on Migrations &amp; Cultures then
@johndurant Are you legit comparing immigration to FORCED DISLOCATION?
@johndurant @JimPethokoukis @WSJ @janetadamy Said America for most of its history
@NateFalconer schools not about learning. It's about grading
@Frisbeeplate @garyvee We are both a lot of things, but beautiful is not one of them :)
@richsandera Credit goes to @garyvee he's a great interviewer. I just tried to keep up
@JustOneJoey1 I agree :). It was mostly @garyvee that made it good, but I'll go back on Gary's show anytime, he was awesome.
@DeeWellsOSD @garyvee Thanks man, glad you you liked it
@pjournel @garyvee Thanks dude, glad you liked it
@AllynPaul @garyvee Thanks man, glad it helped
@JGoldsteinNYC @garyvee yes you did
@ShaneMac @garyvee it's bad. The girls already fight over him https://t.co/Oe51LcsZCn
@garyvee I know. I'm dearly afraid he's going to make me as grandfather when he's 15
@garyvee Great interview, thanks again man. Let's get dinner and wine next time I'm in NYC
@Kevin_Terell @garyvee It's https://t.co/xDv2AuQ29g, different company
@ScottAdamsSays @johndurant Same w/tax returns. Great strategy. Let enemy hinge attacks on those issues, gives you reversal energy for later
@JohnArnoldFndtn @BenedictEvans Thiel critics dont care about facts, their arguments boil down to tribal status signaling and priviledge
@elidourado @pmarca No, the left sides with journalists, the defenders of the elites. Look at it as a class issue, and it makes sense
@NathanLatka @RobertGreene you'd love Robert. He's great
@ChrisDucker Can't wait to hear myself talk :)
@Exp_Mark @Terencecmtse Definitely, hope to be working with you two soon
@nbashaw @hardbound Price?
@nbashaw @hardbound Whats your reach?
@karmakar @JohnRomaniello @tferriss "Advocating cheat day" is not saying that sugar and grain are necessary to produce thyroid hormone
@karmakar Totally false. Literally completely made up.
@KristinaLibby Thanks, glad you liked it
@danparkeryoung @johndurant @robbwolf I agree with the Dr. Most grains without gluten are still bad. And sugar is always bad. Eat real food
@JohnGarvens lemme know what you think. Cameron is full of great knowledge
Cameron is a not just a client, he's my business coach. His new book is great, only 99c for the next 24 hours:  https://t.co/ARQeywdYRK
@johndurant These people are so dumb. They keep setting Trump up. I can't imagine a better enemy than OPPRESSIVE MUSLIM ROYALITY!
@naval plus status and virtue signaling
@johndurant @charliehoehn Whats funny about that? It's just true. They pout and weep and--literally--lick their wounds.
@charliehoehn Oh yes. Savannah baboons do it all the time, especially when they lose social rank. Described in Sapolskys field studies
@johndurant @michaelmalice not literally. That's gross
@johndurant @michaelmalice oh dude. I'd crush that job. I could ride Hillary like a rented mule
@Pv @patio11 I did it every day, which is why I stopped reading news. See' Murray Gell-Mann Effect
@eriktorenberg @b0rk if only there was an easy way to share information through a book. Ahem.
@AdamMGrant I did this too. It painful and then refreshing: https://t.co/deWE7tmN6S
@conorsen I think we'll see "old" cities with infrastructure get big again. Cheaper to restore than build new. happening in Buffalo
@conorsen Id bet on San Antontio too. Cheap, warm, close to Austin, lots of cool old stuff. Seeing companies from here go down there
@conorsen Definitely possible. Just not sure if that type of city will develop again--tech is changing fast
@conorsen Never New Orleans. Way too many weird social issues. Nashville is better bet that Chattanooga. Des Moines has potential

@albertwenger Any specific kind? My company routinely works with the very best editors on earth as freelancers, happy to make a reference

@eriktorenberg Steve Sims
@zen_gineer @AdamMGrant @AlecJRoss NO way. Data CAN beget attention. So can magic and nonsense. We're talking about human attention.

@briankoppelman @JohnRomaniello Many friends indeed. Whats your email? Or just email me, tuckermax@gmail.com.
@JohnRomaniello @briankoppelman Agreed. Love his stuff
@Loh @pookleblinky Thats my point. A book called The Mating Mind makes the case I am talking about, very interesting
@pookleblinky @Loh Maybe not. Lots of mammals have that issue, no human int. Was probably about sexual competition and status displays

@saidjeremy @jockowillink Jocko's book was a kick in the ass about this, no doubt
@RodneyJames138 I try to, but not much time. I usually hit BJJ or muay Thai once a week though. Enough to not get too fat
@HappyLittleGuy WTF are you talking about? Pickup artist? I wrote a book that was the opposite of that. It wasn't a business or company.
@LearningDan @ramez Good question. @singularityu had some good ideas when I was there
I started a new writing series today. No, it's not funny, sorry. First two posts are up: https://t.co/sw4M9kHZvn
@UncredibleHallq @garretsen_h @erikbryn @ramez No. The "idea" is just the rationalization for the tribal/status affiliation.
@erikbryn @garretsen_h @ramez LOL. We all know thats not true: https://t.co/B035Ql0myw
@NilsAParker That would be the greatest shit on earth. I would never stop laughing
@garretsen_h @erikbryn @ramez See Ramez? He's pushing his tribe (economists). Politics=primate status games in pretty clothes w/fancy words.
@NilsAParker The guy BOUGHT THE MILLION DOLLAR WUTANG ALBUM! This is either contrived or just fucking...weird
@NilsAParker ahahhahahahhahahaha that dudes gonna get clipped so hard. Not by wutang, obviously, but the US Gov.
@ramez Politics is almost never about ideas. It's about identity and symbolism and association. Primate status and tribe games

@jvx242 @StartupJKhaled What are you talking about Startup J Khaled has great advice
@StartupJKhaled #fanlove
@StartupJKhaled Try this: "They don't wanna see you skip college and student debt to build things now. They want golden handcuffs on you."
@WomenHealthDocs He is cute, no doubt
@LynGraft That piece got so many facts wrong, it drove me nuts. We gotta get the video planning started I'll call you

@farnamstreet Woohoo!! I can spell!
@farnamstreet Lol--i should have written "company's" success. Me fail English? Unpossible!
@johndurant @BrianBeckcom But thats the thing with full on tribalism--no reason to argue which is better. Just fight and settle it.
@johndurant @BrianBeckcom All political debates are retarded Durant, theyre tribalism masquerading as discussion. When will you learn this?
@johndurant BTW--I agree with your overall point. HRC kills Rubio in a general election.
@johndurant FYI--Obama's core was not, and is not now, blacks. His core was leftist elites--he's one of them
@ramez @JeffLandale They vote tribe and status ahead of all things. Like all primates

@johndurant @nntaleb That book is terrible; narcissistic rambling cliche. John, you lost the ability to objectively evaluate Trump long ago

@cameronherold look at this clown https://t.co/v6x4qs29wx
Tl;dr don't wear crocs, wear leather shoes  https://t.co/Ukn8n3xhim
@RealTrumpsFeels @brandongorrell who cites thought catalog articles? we have 30,000 words of citations in the book.
@RealTrumpsFeels @brandongorrell when two cultist tribal groups hate you it means you're right
@scottlincicome you're drinking the wrong wine. Most people do. Took me time to really learn wine.
@brodigan @scottlincicome not bashing. Teaching Scott about wine.
@scottlincicome yes trump of course. But still--Pinot is the best expression of red wine there is when done right. Tons of great ones
@scottlincicome that's not exceptions! It's the defining expression of the grape!
@scottlincicome Do know that Burgundy is pinot? Youre calling the most expensive and sought after wines on earth weak. Makes you look bad
@amyalkon @geoffmillerphd He's a great interview, as I am sure you know
@mhixbb those guys have their own issues they need to work out. It's not about you
@jameswilsterman Thats cool, I just signed up. Do this for Tim Ferriss' podcasts, he has a big audience
@EricJorgenson @ProductHunt Yeah, I am on your email list
@kissingsky @MatingGrounds @JohnGarvens I have a kid. It's possible. My son sleeps 12 hours a night
@jameswilsterman Thats a great write up. Do you do that for other podcasts?
@JohnGarvens @MatingGrounds Sleeping 8 hours a night is the best lifehack there is
@johndurant @NilsAParker I still think Bloomberg runs and wins. He could get the Republicans to turn on Trump
@NilsAParker The email investigation is backed by the White House, not Republicans. Its inevitable she gets serious legal issues
@NilsAParker Nonsense. This is a baller move fo Biden. Stay out until Hillary gets indicted, swopes in saves the party, avoids the primary
@mollymulshine why can't men also use those words jokingly, or in a way to not shame? I have definitely heard men say "slut" in that way
@mollymulshine LOL! So you're just redefining "slut shaming" to exclude how your friends talk about women! OK, I see whats up now.
@mollymulshine didn't you say that your experience does not reflect most women? B/c I see women using slut all the time, never positive
@mollymulshine Calling a woman a whore is not slut shaming? If thats not then what is?
@mollymulshine Or this one comparing men &amp; women finds women slut shame 2x as much: https://t.co/iXgsaOEPMC
@mollymulshine Just look through google, there are so many studies: https://t.co/Wogu3EBdTt
@mollymulshine Its a study that highlights how much women slut shamed other women. Its precisely on point.
@mollymulshine Just google "slut shaming studies" Its a list of things like this: https://t.co/hZNT420qGY
@mollymulshine Totally possible, and if so, thats awesome for you, and says good things about you; i've seen it many times other way.
@mollymulshine Men absolutely can be, but women far worse and do it far more. Lots of clear data about this, ask @drhelenfisher
@theronnivp @observer Differ how?
LIVE on #Periscope: Meet @danmartell and @shaawasmund / my two favorite people in this room ;) #thrive15 #lasvegas https://t.co/nTDUDfkbsK
@JohnGarvens depends on many factors. Can be good decision for many
@HustleCon @A_R_Zimm Quit. Right now. Get up and walk out.
@EricJorgenson mate deal was first. Podcast was to sandbox info delivery styles and angle.
@theessentialman @ramit it's literally the opposite of a pick up book.
@johndurant Those are the only two options??
@AshLopezRadio @DrewCurtis Yes I did. He's awesome. Would be the best thing to ever happen to Kentucky (after Coach Cal).
@belfusion Which one?
@dcurtis how could they signal their status if anyone could go?
@johndurant They aren't struggling with fractions. They are caught in a frame they aren't seeing
@MichelFalcon sent. Mary will take great care of you @CameronHerold I got it brother, thanks!
@duncetrouncer @ChrisRyanPhD Chris, the guy with 3 followers is in your corner. I bet you're excited
@ChrisRyanPhD @johndurant @cdixon I did! But it doesn't make it true! I'm not a Rousseau, fantacizing about prehistory. It sucked.
@ChrisRyanPhD @johndurant @cdixon Pick any, it's better. Lifespan, leisure, convenience, opportunity, safety, social connections, etc
@johndurant @cdixon What he never foresaw was a future where EVERYONE was rich, at least in relation to human history
@jaltucher @scottbalster Yeah I already have a company that does this
@CaveatEmptorSD http://t.co/uZZISsFk6p
@CaveatEmptorSD Oh yeah--all the bonus material is on the site, not in a PDF
@CaveatEmptorSD I have no idea what Geoff said in the audiobook. All of the things linked in the book are on the website. What PDF was it?
@shloky Not true. Most readers can't afford anything in the magazine. It's aspirational, not instructional. Signaling 101
@JohnGarvens @MatingGrounds I'd love to read that as well. I'm not the person to write it though. Should be women. Obviously
@BenLevy74 @bootstraplabs Yeah man, happy to talk, tuckermax@gmail.com is easiest
@bencasnocha @StartupLJackson No, opposite. Only 5% are worth slowly contemplating. The rest can easily be effectively summarized
@bencasnocha @StartupLJackson Ben that is not true. Only applies to 5% of books at best.
@micah Yeah dude, I literally went through this with Murph. She died the week after Bishop was born. If you need to talk, call me
@micah Oh dude. My dog got cancer. It was bad
When Tucker Max Pitches His Startup http://t.co/JcHnhr2FRI
@MehLisCAT I did my AMA on @ProductHunt, its where the cool kids are doing them now cc: @eriktorenberg
@imagejennation No too busy with my new company
@me9an A bunch actually. Women loved the book, which proves its good advice
People waiting in line for iPhones: Do you know they will mail them to your house now?
@kaywil89 @theCHIVE OBVIOUSLY!
@benthompson never rely on the ny times for any objective data
@ReformedBroker @TaoOfChadC Also, whole book industry is expanding. My company grew 50% last quarter. Huge demand for new book styles
@ReformedBroker @TaoOfChadC Not made up. Expanding relative to huge drop from a few years ago.
@TaoOfChadC @ReformedBroker It is 100% signaling. The NY Times speaks to a specific tribe who want to believe this, so they write it
@ReformedBroker dude they aren't counting self pub books. Ridiculous
@eriktorenberg @ProductHunt Get @paigecraig and @mytableapp
@Kitty_Megatron @NilsAParker did you try looking on Amazon? Like everyone else on earth?
@PenWritten It costs 15k, not 8-10k. We spread payments over 6 months, but that's it. You can do it yourself: http://t.co/mMOcEhFA4K
@MrTamPham Yeah, we don't spend a ton of time on online dating, and thats all he does. Its important, so its a good compliment
@MrTamPham Actually yes. We had not refined process when Nils &amp; Geoff and I were writing Mate, but we started book w/transcribed podcasts
@ENuevavilla It was. We sold the company to Heaven Hill Distillery
@lajump how?
@nickkush20 haha. I guess I was
@nikcastro2 yeah we're sending an email out about this next week
@WGF_216 The evidence is clear. They stopped talking about it because the sports media is controlled by the NFL
@bobbybreal123 I'm a fucking human being, not a brand, you dipshit
@jessica_downie @pkeys07 Hating the Patriots is the only Patriotic thing to do
@WGF_216 First result genius: http://t.co/LXKtOc4xNB
@WGF_216 @zhennessy_ @angrysubby If only you were connected to a network of easily accessible information where you could find it
@LowGoPSU Typical Penn State sociopath. Go get a job in a concentration camp, you fucking psycho
@zhennessy_ @angrysubby He brutally raped a girl. Go read the testimony. If it doesn't make you hate him, you have no soul
@hamms317 Not rape. Just murder and DUI
@LowGoPSU Go read the Smoking Gun testimony from witnesses who saw what happened. If you can read that and defend Ben, you're a monster
@hamms317 @angrysubby Oh dude, please don't think I'm defending Pats. They're awful too, they just get caught more than Steelers
@jmaszak Dude, what Ben did is rape. Go read the Smoking Gun archive with testimony from witnesses. Its mortifying
@LowGoPSU ahahhahaa everyone look! A PENN STATE FAN DEFENDING A RAPIST! Oh this is rich
@angrysubby Pretty sure he was married at the time. He cheated and commited a felony
Want some real comedy? When Steeler fans complain about cheating Patriots, point out they have a rapist at Quarterback. Forthing anger.
@realjasonstru @PFTCommenter @_BigBen7 You must approve of bar rape. Only conclusion
@PFTCommenter I think he's mad that I don't think his his off-season bar rape program is a legit way to train
@PFTCommenter @_BigBen7 He blocked me too. I have more followers than he does.
@johndurant Granted, not a fair comparison, but a funny line
@johndurant Hey, you've got heart disease? I can help by sleeping with you wife!
@stefanklumpp Thanks. Always my goal is to be opposite of fluff
@ventures9 @charliehoehn Me or Charlie?
@charliehoehn sociopaths never do
@danmartell i almost did that retreat with my wife. Have fun man looks really cool
@ConradDeas that book isn't out yet.
@RajeshTaylor @farnamstreet I'd go on. I can talk about books and decision-making and knowledge for hours, not to mention my book
@ChrisRyanPhD his name is Renzo
@johndurant @nntaleb Nassim he's staying at my place, like some vagrant flaneur :)
@RiskRewardFBN my son watching me on your show http://t.co/sTm0h5SMYR
@kevinroose Its funny, remember when you did a piece about me doing angel investing? I just got out, publicly: http://t.co/9ePvUlHUdX
@SaraSScully also one of them has a mullet
@mayathebeeeeee tuckermax@gmail.com
@MarisaKabas @NICKIMINAJ Don't be ridiculous. Maybe for President Of Bubblegum Pop Music, she'd get my vote
@MarisaKabas good question. I'd vote for @pmarca, @naval and @nntaleb. Definitely @StartupLJackson
@MarisaKabas @bakedinapie I've legit never registered to vote. No politician has ever inspired me enough to want to stand behind them.
@JeremyShure @RyanHoliday Ryan can't use photoshop!
@MarisaKabas @bakedinapie No. I tend to prefer narcissists who aren't ignorant monsters.
I seriously hope this is photoshopped. This endorsement would hurt my brand :) https://t.co/z9VfF12Jys
This is my normal Sunday morning, watching my son go through the poop phases in front of me http://t.co/MtrzfgvRwt
@WillYouLaugh that's not bad. The stuff you say we brush aside though, we go into detail in. It is important
@BigBuckeye24 @ClayTravisBGID No. His writing is nowhere near as good. And he's uglier. And he roots for a garbage school.
@AdamJKovac It's a hard life
@AdamJKovac @AskMen Ask him hard hitting questions, like "How did you get to be both handsome AND brilliant?" :)
@RationalSouth It's not lunch. It's an ebook. Those are easy to make free.
@RobBoyles1418 of course
If you've wanted to write a book, this (free) book lays out the entire process in detail: http://t.co/AGLdcKRqWt http://t.co/Ki29L89Xb4
@tilotta Its a podcast, you can listen anytime
@zackz0diac Yep. You can build real skills in any field, then look for opportunities to solve problems. Thats how you build a business
@zackz0diac Neither. Learning and working in a field you think you like
@JesseNile @micah lol
I think the artist @MaximMag used to draw me in this profile is the guy who did the Tom Brady courtroom picture: http://t.co/YAhnVDQEDS
@allenthird It looks like something my son would draw.
@jeffwilser @michelleruiz Skeptical of what, exactly?
Ignore the teaser, its all bullshit and the opposite of the article, which is good, "The Reinvention of Tucker Max" http://t.co/YAhnVE8fvq
@michelleruiz @MaximMag As soon as it's up, I'll push it out to all my fans
@michelleruiz @MaximMag Is that story online yet?
@ReformedBroker No man, I gotta be publicly right about a market move first. Otherwise I'm just Jim Cramer with hair and swag
@tbohen LOL, you think I made all my money on books? Thats cool, let's see who's right :)
@ReformedBroker Youre the expert, I have a question: If I publicly call the 15370 as the Dow low on the way to 20k+, do I get to go on TV?
@jaronoff Awesome, thank you for pointing that out
@micah Its really hard at the start, and that raw pain is an indicator of the right path. Good for you. Keep being raw and open.
@TrentDyrsmid Yeah we are changing that, sorry. 15k for basic package, 25k with marketing. My bad man
@WhatThe_HEC @katelynmoodyy  it's fairly elitist and exclusionary to assume the only people who can put their idea zin books are "writers"
Interview on @mixergy How Tucker Max Is Disrupting Writing And Publishing http://t.co/85L2YfHa84
@micah @fasterstill So great. That's it man; real action that makes you vulnerable and lets the people who love you come in. Keep going
Ok so maybe there some pretty cool things about angel investing 😏 https://t.co/Q5ZTHaHAjl
@ppp24 Darn tootin! It was nice
@satpalparmar to a lesser extent yes. But vcs are responsible to lps
@justGLew get help from he experts: tuckermax@gmail.com
@benthompson you're assuming they're a news org. They're not. Theyre a signaling and group identity machine for angry progressives
@ReformedBroker http://t.co/3nrCt2pdyh
@ReformedBroker Much different than they did with the iCloud leak. Hot actresses get different rules than cheating husbands and wives
@ReformedBroker right. A misunderstood process "gut" often fails at the worst time.
@ReformedBroker people who win with gut usually don't know what they're doing right, rationalize after the fact
@ReformedBroker gut can be repeatable and often is. Mistake comes in studying the subjects stated explanations for success
@ReformedBroker on a psychological level, gut instinct is also process, just process you don't consciously understand.
@clandry @traversdavid Right, thats entire point. Angel investing is great if you have the right tools/skills. Otherwise, avoid entirely.
@clandry @traversdavid Thats my point. Structure of angel investing doesn't work for most.
@clandry @traversdavid Sure, but thats a fringe strategy that lets you compete with bigger angels/funds, not for amateurs or non-experts
@clandry @traversdavid That does work in CPG. But different risk/reward profiles
@clandry @traversdavid if youre trying to make your living on the 20-30mm deals, in tech, you are playing with fire. Risk/reward is off
@clandry @traversdavid Maybe so, but every experienced angel I know says they aren't worth time/opp cost. Data seems to back that up
@clandry @traversdavid 2. Youre right, this was a misprint. I spent 1k hours on ALL my angel investments. Printed wrong.
@clandry @traversdavid OK, let's see 1. I did back older and more experienced. And empirical data supports my experience. What else to say?
@traversdavid @clandry @observer lol, I asked same question. Genuinely curious
@clandry What part do you disagree with?
@Mosaic_VC Gotta love VC's who don't even denote $1.2 as millions--they just assume. Private equity is amazing.
@adjunctwriter ideas for what?
@ericaogrady I didn't think that was out yet? Where'd you read it in the print mag?
@shloky Ask @eriktorenberg to hook you up. Eric, Shlok is OK, he's a friend of mine and Ryans
@shloky Its says you are already on
@PamHege Glad you like it, I hope we can help you. If you need anything beyond what my book development team can provide, happy to help
@shloky you need one? I have them
@camillericketts @WhitnieLow @phineasb Huge fan of what you and your team is doing at First Round Camille. Really incredible.
@jon_sibley I'd love to, but like I said in my piece, I need to spend my time on my family &amp; my company. That doesn't fit those two things
@jon_sibley What conference?
@jon_sibley you kidding? Or serious?
@rustyw @MelsStyles We have 5 more case studies to put up. At stage where we're growing so fast we cant keep up, good problem to have
@rustyw It works shockingly well. We have like 15 books out, and another 70+ authors in process.
@nefinjohn @Jason LOL--no one can keep Jason out of the game
@slobotski Thanks man, I appreciate it
@KevinColleran LOL--I didn't say you have a chance, I said you're one of the ones who does it right!
@ryanjwill @observer Ehh. I probably couldn't hack writing for a living.
ICYMI: Why I Stopped Angel Investing (And Why You Shouldn't Start) http://t.co/pQN34yB1uV
@jpawlak2 I didn't say bad investments, I said not enough good people to execute. Different argument. LOTS of good ideas out there
@realventures Absolutely, feel free.
@BillDA Lol, prob true, but I've found you can either worry about getting stuff done, or getting credit, but not both.
@Hugh_W_Forrest @observer lol. I'm married with a kid! Someone else has to take bad boy title
@PullNews Data shows youre wrong. More people buying &amp; reading books than ever
@LakshMody LOL. No competent VC will ever tell you to start at a seed fund. Start building companies to get experience. Only place to get it
@BitcoinHawker reading is fundamental
@EugeneWan @bfeld What's weird about it? I love reading Brads stuff its great
@shloky @RyanHoliday He wrote novels. A few of them. So weird.
@KevinEspiritu @crashdev Chris, I talk about why most angels invest in there. But granted, I don't delve highly into non-money issues
@freshfey @Jason yes, but it was mostly luck in my relationships. I know the right people, and knew them at the right times
@sama Thanks man. I wrote it to make more people see these points, not enough get it. You &amp; @paulg write about this a lot, most miss it
@Jason quoted in my angel investing piece, thanks for blog/podcast, taught me a lot: http://t.co/2MNtDO7Y6O
@sama Quoted you a bunch in my piece on angel investing, thanks for your blog, its great: http://t.co/2MNtDO7Y6O
@NVelasquez @tferriss I actually would too. I name Tim in the piece as an example of a great angel.
@ppp24 Thanks man
@trengriffin I linked a bunch of "Things I Learned" for this article, thanks for writing those, they're great: http://t.co/2MNtDO7Y6O

@MikeMckim Awesome, we'll be talking soon

@AlexRubalcava @pmarca protectionist also.
@johndurant Every attractive woman on the internet, some dude comments her on being masculine. Its their latent homosexuality coming thru

@TrillTamwar No idea. I miss him

@RyanHoliday my fav part is their indignation ab/t posting truth. they didnt say that way when their editor was charged w/domestic violence
@ModelAyshaMirza He better be adorable, or we're sending him back for a new one!
@ModelAyshaMirza No, not about just hooking up either. the two things are not mutually exclusive
@ModelAyshaMirza book isn't really about commitment. It's how to be attractive to women, to get what you want (which could be commitment)
@ppp24 You're going to want to read this one. It's really good, very different from the others
@ScottGoodTech Be careful falling in the LinkedIn rabbit hole, it takes you to many unusual places
@EricJorgenson You're going to like Mate. It's really good.
@paigecraig people only have good things to say about me ;)

@JustineTunney same as now. Code will become commodity like mechanical power
@JustineTunney not true. Literacy in mechanical age was not defined by knowing how to fix engines

@sckain @richroll Not fighting like chimps doesn't mean we're swapping spit in the shower
@sckain @richroll You can agree w/some things, and not others. Reaction to the part is not always reaction to the whole, it's cool

@donjuannc feel free to refer. We'll take care of him
@scHoolboydanny I didn't say I wanted to be in it. Just attend it.
@reffreyjeeves And I would attend your big gay wedding, because it would be awesome
@dustinbeethe Was it literally the same day???
Marriage equality is great &amp; I'm happy for gay people...but to be really honest, WAY MORE excited about attending gay weddings, esp in Texas
@KeithContorno @NilsAParker actually we plan on putting the stuff we cut up for free in the site.

@nikcastro2 Cesar Milan best for most people.
@andrewchen Too many numbers to be funny to me :)
@andrewchen Come on, just the assumptions he makes are so absurd they woudnt pass sniff test for any empirical analysis
@andrewchen Its doesnt answer it. It uses voodoo stats to give an answer. This is religion for analytical people; illusion of certainty
@mgsiegler Why does it perplex them? Have they never heard of signaling? The cost is the entire point.
@andrewchen That would be such a disaster. Like aspies need to stare at their phone more.
@andrewchen yeah. weird stuff. Feel sorry for people like that, we take so much cognitive processing for granted
@andrewchen Not sure of answer. Maybe small group instructional, with video and play acting, etc? That would be expensive though
@andrewchen I face same issue in podcasts with them. Theyre so literal, its really hard to reach them. Have to speak their language
@andrewchen Hard to make it text only. Huge issue is body language, facial expressions, etc.

@randfish @marvinliao email me, happy to help, I can guide you through the process, intro you to agents, etc : tuckermax@gmail.com
@berkun The questions have been asked &amp; answered. They dont look. Its lazy shock journalism designed to make psuedo-intellectuals feel smart
@berkun Again, media not about understanding, its about producing emotional reaction to drive attention. You should know this.
@berkun Most wine "experts" are just snobs, agree. But to ignore actual basis for understanding wine is just another form of snobbery
@berkun Absolutely, but only w/small number &amp; at margins. Maybe 0.01% of wine brands know to non-wine ppl. 99.99% of wines priced by experts
@berkun And of course, approx zero pop science articles about wine tasting even address this fact
@berkun Also, taste may be subjective, but basis for expensive wine is NOT. Wine is priced on complexity, which is measurable and replicable
@berkun Actually it doesn't at all. Almost all research in this area is flawed; it tries to "prove" one side or the other.
@berkun $43 wine is not expensive. Not remotely.
@marvinliao @randfish rand, I love Moz. happy to help with publishing, even if you dont want to use my company, I know that business well
@tferriss @bencasnocha yes in theory. But like I said, it's a curated list. Wsj is less curated, more straight sales. Nyt hates self pub
@tferriss bc their list is "curated". Which means they try to only put "real" books on them. It's bs, still true. Wsj is easier
@tferriss no real in store dis (Ingram only), and the ny times tends to under count self pubbed titles.
@tferriss yep, but harder
@Pv @pmarca yep. See you there
@Pv @pmarca hahhahahaa yep. He was listening to our conversation
@AdamZagoria @theknicksblog you would hope his record rules it out though
@hnshah the gravitational constant is permanent. probably, at least
@CDRawesome @robbwolf @readingliberty you didn't already have maximum love for Robb? Wtf???
@robbwolf @readingliberty ahahhahaah morons are stupid
@Pv afternoon coffee? I can't have caffeine past 10am. But yeah I'm free between 230 and 5, just tell me where
@Pv @SuperpoweredSDK God uses an iPhone :)
@eriktorenberg You starting a band?
@DrewCurtis @peterawad I don't pander to political types like you!!
@TheEricW @KySportsRadio I can't do terrestrial radio. I curse too much.
@johnmaeda But that doesn't really deny his point--that science has vastly improved overall human welfare in many domains
@johnmaeda Not really true. Average very different than mean and median. Infant mortality skews numbers. Cavemen routinely lived to 60+
@richroll my pleasure man it was great. Good interviewers get good stuff out of me
@seobrien good piece. Very well argued and I think right. Sv builds the bones, we add the flesh
@bennyluo yeah I was there, Dan and Brandon are friends. I'm in la until saturday
@marvinliao you shouldn't talk to him. He's an asshole!
If you're up this early, you should be reading things like this that make you smarter: https://t.co/QZR3SSZWkk
@abatalion @SteveCase @AOL boo! Boo on puns! You lazy comedian! Shame and vitriol!
@SteveCase @abatalion @AOL PRODIGY WAS TECHNICALLY FIRST!!!!
@M89Roth it's on the site
@omid @johndurant Put a ribbon on a turd, it's still a turd, brother
@johndurant I tried it, felt like shit. It was exactly how I feel after eating bread. Only an improvement for people already eating shit
@marvinliao me fail English? That's unpossible!
@marvinliao haha reading is that learning about a different person. So much has changed since then. Mostly for better
@micah from you, yes
The women in Mayweather's life should feel honored: it took $180M for him to agree to fight Pacquiao. He fought them for FREE!
@DwoodsInsurance @brettamorgan manny doesn't have 10 domestic violence convictions. He just sings badly.
@RickMcGov lol
Attention all girlfriends that Floyd Mayweather has hit: just wear a Pacquio mask, and Floyd will just wave at you and back up
What's the best version of the "if pacman was a woman mayweather would've been aggressive" joke?
@neverabogey603 the peak is always right before the fall
@cdixon nothing barbaric about fighting. It's as human as sex and eating.
That "fight" perfectly displays why mma is the future of combat sports
@Loh dinosaurs were not around in Paleo. Mostly Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. You know this, man!
@wmaterka thanks man. If you ever use the process, let me know how it worked for you
@wmaterka and not be glib, but our process is literally someone's voice, just turned into book prose. Might be better way to find voice
@wmaterka meaning that it can accommodate any voice
@wmaterka I don't think so. Our process focuses not on voice but on clarity
@t_1_m @MichaZwaaf I think does both: makes me a better person and makes me boring. It's a good boring
@wmaterka it may be great, it doesn't help you actually write a book though.
@nisselson everyone singing happy birthday to Evan right before his speech http://t.co/h4UyL7V2E2
@jpknegtel you can do both. They appeal to different ppl and hold a different place in culture
@_Agavni thanks
@reneeveldman sorry about that. It should be up now: http://t.co/dyZzxEuck2
@Tiana60s @TNWconference thank you 4 the kind words
@MassiveMessage @jaltucher Thanks James--go to http://t.co/xDv2AuQ29g, we are happy to help
@andreamansoor @zachobront Email Zach, admin@bookinabox.com, he'll send  the email we sent that explains how to get on the job mailing list
@andreamansoor @zachobront You missed the deadline by several days. We are already interviewing finalists. Sorry.
@TheRealStarky @richroll Technically, I'm not single. I'm married now.
@conrey yep, "Easy to do, but hard to do well"--how much of life does that descibe?
@conrey we tried to make it easy, that sucks that it was hard.
@jumprrr We're happy to talk. Fill the form out, or email my co-founder, he'll be in contact quickly, @zachobront
@ShaneMac We say it's the ideas and principles that help people guide their decision making in places of uncertainty (which is most places)
@dvanderbloomen don't we specifically address this issue?
@Jnils91 you are obviously new to sales and business
@daykneeaj No one else has an issue with the site.
@lisamarieKY I'm the CEO of the company
@daykneeaj Not for me
My company is hiring for sales; but we want u to solve customer problems, not just sell regardless of need http://t.co/s9Lk9cVXZ6
@ShaneMac I think it's actually a key to your heart
@DudeProducts oh my god yes. Great call
@ramit Series A not easy right now, it's actually a bottleneck. Seed is what's easy, and yes, that's going away eventually.
@spope2 Ask @eriktorenberg hes the guy who has them
Sorry @eriktorenberg and @ProductHunt I lied to you, but it ended up working out: https://t.co/tMpWSnV2BG
@AdamMGrant Thank you so much. There is no bigger sign of a time vampire than someone who asks to "pick your brain." THE WORST.
@DC__Wolf Nope
@M89Roth @NilsAParker nope
@sama second life
@sama google glass
@ENuevavilla Everyone hates Laettner
@NilsAParker @KySportsRadio the po-po's is checkin the hollers!
@NilsAParker @KySportsRadio The meth dealers in WV need their burners
@M89Roth @charliehoehn he gets it eventually. That episode is weeks old in real time. It's gets better
@amitsonawane @pmarca hahahaha, you're right and I'm stupid. Its been like 10 years since I read it
@pmarca And best stuff I've read on the fall is blog posts by Martin Armstrong. Modern historians are awful at understanding economics
@pmarca Honestly, best book is Colleen McColloughs "Man Of Rome" series. Covers Sulla to Octavian. Yes fiction, but precise and reads true
@charliehoehn yep
@daganmv99 email tuckermax@gmail
@micah definitely let me know when you're in town
@abatalion @la_Barbecue @paigecraig I don't blame. It's hard work, bein a genius wit a meat coma
@abatalion @la_Barbecue @paigecraig yeah don't thank me that's fine the bbq just floated over to you
@johndurant that would require people to stop using identity to negotiate status. You're right but Good luck.
@micah Hey you at SXSW?
@ShafiqDe Depends on what you're looking for; WCS more of a Tyson Chandler type, KAT closer to Pau Gasol. Both great, different players
@grapeswithaview @ShaneMac I'm just hoping to get a glass before shane finishes the case
@CooperHarris @ShaneMac it's all fun and games until she gets pregnant
@KylerHutchison Never killed anyone
@KylerHutchison if don't like laughing, don't read it
@ChrisSpoke @StartupLJackson haha you totally underestimate media. People think we live in a democracy with two distinct parties bc of media
@StartupLJackson It's a major branding failure that Uber/airbnb/etc aren't seen as populist heroes. So easy to tell that story
@andrewglynch I told you this. Its going down to .80 over the next year plus
@DaRealAmberRose Aren't you famous for dating rappers? I think you have men figured out really well. (BTW--I'm the author of that book)
@mg @ShaneMac @NobleBrewerBeer I like Budweiser, but pretend I hate it, so people will think I'm fancy! I'm
@BigShotRob11 We have recorded like 7 episodes, he gets better every week. He WILL SUCCEED! I promise
@eglozman we've done about 600k since the launch, and yes, it takes you 12 hours of talking. Takes us about 4 months of work.
@NobleBrewerBeer @mg I am still upset you wouldn't give me free beer today at your booth. I will drink a Budweiser in protest.
@jhagel @stevedenning the article assumes innovation comes from existing firms. Mostly comes from new firms, that's where barriers are
@nbashaw @danshipper @imcatnoone @tzhongg @lachlanjc @gwintrob @RichLittlehale @ChrisDelloRusso @Global_licious its a good piece, well done
@adamrosenfield Yep.
@meetsamir haha. Your book there soon
@BenedictEvans "bacon on a turd" is the opposite of lipstick on a pig
@KySportsRadio what a great typo
@kaitlynolliff I have four.
@LynGraft @bookinabox thats not our twitter handle! Seriously, I have no idea who that is.
My favorite site @ProductHunt is profiling my new company: http://t.co/1n3Tqrc0Ut
@abatalion its passive aggressive projection, the writer is reacting to events in his life, not your post. Yours was very good &amp; right.
@freagnt_jg funny you say that, we are seriously thinking about that doing model with a pretty famous academic
@Trav003 I think you are deeply misunderstanding what I was saying
@Trav003 of course fear is an emotion. Why would you think otherwise?
@SoManyWays2Joey @sxsw I live in Austin. But I dont take meetings about "picking my brain."
@nntaleb @IKEAUSA ahahhahaha only you would notice that.
.@IKEAUSA My baby has outgrown its shelf. I fear he may grow into a cube shaped human. Do you make larger sizes? http://t.co/WnRIModtCO
Duke playing UNC tonight. Don't forget: the only good thing about Duke is that it's 15 minutes from Chapel Hill.
@rrhoover @ProductHunt meant that *I* will buy rounds. Ur right my Twitter license needs to be suspended. Me fail English? Thats unpossible
@rrhoover @ProductHunt no license is fine--buy a few rounds after our interview at Launch, and then we'll all take Ubers home
@ProductHunt Crap, I forgot to @ProductHunt in my tweet, even though I follow you guys on Twitter. I get an F at Twitter
@mcaddison @reserve I am signed up, but its only in a few cities, and hardly has any restaurants. But excited for its potential
@OpenTable my opentable account has been closed w/no explanation, and theres literally no way to contact your company on your site
@StartupJackson @TheSteveMcGarry @hnshah Didn't say I took his advice. I read it, think its smart, then do something stupid instead
@TheSteveMcGarry @hnshah Ive been reading hitens stuff for years. He's smart.
@hnshah That would be a hilarious resume.
@StartupLJackson I keep telling people, media is nothing but signaling for elites. Not about news, facts or anything but social status
@KristoferTM I think they took the post down, or hid it or something, just wanted to let you know why. Thanks though
@KristoferTM thanks for posting about BIAB on product hunt, but we're launching it with the PH team in two weeks.
@nickchom @charliehoehn dude you don't have to eat there. You could just meet her out
@BenedictEvans isn't your wonkiness why we all read your writing?
@ReformedBroker I honestly don't know the answer, I'm really curious what happens. I got in Twitter pre-ipo, sold post, not pushing my luck
@johndurant or they'll use Snapchat or Cyberdust, and delete everything. One path or the other.
@ReformedBroker I mean ?, not $
@ReformedBroker $--you think all the insiders would signal support for Dick C in advance if earnings were going to be good?
@MichaelFishman Looks like we are both investors in Thrive too. That last report was pretty awesome.
@Vandi_G_FvO Watching Carroll's press conference where he says it was "his call" must have been very embarrassing for you
I have made some really bad decisions in my life...and I can't even begin to understand Pete Carroll's decision to pass it there
Doug Baldwin celebrated his touchdown by pooping out the football. This should be the only topic of conversation http://t.co/5en8Lc0ND9
@ReformedBroker They don't care about inequality. Their writing is signaling traits about themselves, not about the actual issues
@robfee I don't blame them. Its hard to give any answer thats not a cliche when you have traumatic brain in jury
@robfee you forgot the intentional burying of decades of data showing how brutally bad concussions are for humans
@jaltucher @mctiller her website is http://t.co/DCf4mfcwrM
@rlongworth26 feb. Like we said on the site and email list
@JohnRomaniello @AubreyMarcus Noah is coming over for dinner Wednesday night--you still in town then? Next time email or text!
@iDobby_ @MatingGrounds No. Restarts in Feb, like we said in the email and on the site.
@robbwolf @johndurant Getting him started early:  http://t.co/N5imwjqexY
@DaveCharbonneau Thanks for the tip, we'll do that. They aren't really competitors though, we don't have competitors. Right now at least
@johnrobb oh man. Go long oil huh?
@patio11 I tell people I retired early because I just got so rich it made no sense to work anymore. That usually stops the questions
@topCweb @jasonmcamps @PoorMansAngel Jasons call. I liked doing it.
@aytekintank "Turning a problem into a product"--great title, I'm going to steal that and use it for a future post. I owe you a drink
@johndurant @ABC that's looks like you john
@blainemcgaff @jaltucher I'm everywhere.
You lost Cowboys fans, but at least Tony Romo didn't blow the game for you. Progress!
@ReformedBroker it's cool, I get paid and I get to hang out with friends. Win-win.
@BenedictEvans Global yes. I was only talking about Hollywood, which is about 15-20 billion, depending on who whos numbers
@BenedictEvans also bigger than all of Hollywood movie and tv revenue
@johnaconroy No, totally different. It can look similar from outside, but completely different processes, etc.
@johnaconroy Nope. I planned to do something big with that, but another business took off instead, shifted to that: http://t.co/o5EWVtrUmp
@jcwells12 Taking January off, restart in Feb. I talked about this in the email sent to the list
@johnaconroy we took it down
@jaltucher People don't care about my business, they care about how they can get a book. But good interview, you always get me to open up
@jaltucher James, the episode should be called "How To Finally Write Your Book" or something like that.
If you've always wanted to write a book, on @jaltucher podcast I explain how to do it in about 12 hours: http://t.co/ABPPhVTicI
Enjoy the playoffs while you can Cowboys fans. You know the greatest Romo that Romo ever pulled is coming. It's destiny.
@Loh not hard work--regulatory capture
@Loh thats the point, neither usps nor direct mailers will do that, b/c it benefits neither
@Loh Thats basically what Outbox did. Read the piece--USPS serves direct mail, not recipients of mail. And direct mailers have no incentive
@Loh outbox tried this and the usps shut them down bc direct mail are their customers: http://t.co/vIfDeahjKm
@vicutetiqyl I didn't meet you. Was at home with my famiky
@kamalravikant @hunterwalk Buddha had it slightly off. It's 99 problems not 83

@ImDruChainz If you think being a father makes you soft, you have a really fucked up worldview.
Babies can be so much fun. He went from "CIA level torture" to "this tastes good" in about 10 seconds http://t.co/mmwSs1UWOz
@MenckenHitchens @cdbuckler Nope. data changes based on age, econ demo, etc. NYC is perfect example; single young women, married old women
@cdbuckler bad data. 18-64 is not realistic mating range for most guys. Not adjusted for socioeconomic group either
@Trill_Sara @JustineTunney rap is social/pol movement, but not for SJWs, who are white. rap is black soc/pol movement, different goals.
@Trill_Sara @JustineTunney If SJWs ruling rap, explain every Snoop &amp; 50 Cent lyric-racist, sexist, misogynist, pretty much all rappers
@stevesi do you realize doctors don't learn nutrition in med school? Yet many diseases are best addressed by dietary changes
@stevesi pretty much all doctors are like this. Illusion of expertise backed by no real evidence. Not just tv doctors
@KySportsRadio lowest halftime point total in history for UCLA. Old low was 14.
@ReformedBroker I see your tweets retweeted so much in my timeline by other people it was time to cut out the middleman
@johndurant I keep telling people it wasnt North Korea. WAY too socially sophisticated
@DavidAdler4 if you think wedmd is reliable you're going to be very unhealthy
@DavidAdler4 Did you read any of the literature? Start here, this is an intro: http://t.co/s3GFSpIa6D
@trengriffin no shes shorting gluten.
@ErikTorenberg mostly dark triad types. Lots of data on this: http://t.co/54brK3S1rz
@JustineTunney wont happen. rap music is from a different culture, theyll never go after it, also, they know rappers wont take their shit
@johndurant you need to include trigger warnings with posts like this
@katefagan3 KEEP MY NAME OUT YO MOUTH! Just kidding, that comment about me on @AroundtheHorn actually made me laugh
@ErikTorenberg Erik, to see why journalists are worst curators possible, checkout Murray Gell-Mann amnesia effect: http://t.co/JhlFlfo8MX
@holdenbrad @ErikTorenberg @nuzzel Also, I think @Quibb is trying to do this as well.
@ErikTorenberg Example: would you rather read what @pmarca likes, or ANY journalist? He knows his domains well, they dont
@ErikTorenberg Journalists might be WORST curators, they look for writing quality and status of writer, not information quality
@ErikTorenberg VCs, angels, CEOs, various other people who do or know things I dont know. Want to see what they think says smart stuff
@ErikTorenberg Yes--but why just journalists? I'd much rather see what smart people of all domains read and thought valuable.
@rrhoover the best is @PrideBites, their custom stuff is awesome, especially for dog people who have more money than sense, like me
@ryanjwill yeah man, email me and we'll find a time
@Barry_Carter @seanplat @thedavidwwright Thats a really good piece dude. Very few people understand my point about haters, you got it
@neiltyson @kamalravikant 2/which aliens would figure out very quickly and easily.
@neiltyson @kamalravikant 1/ humans dont kill for those reasons. theyre rationalizations for what are all ultimately status competitions

@ErikTorenberg If he needs publishing help, I'd be happy to assist, send my email. love to hear both sides of story, itd be compelling
@ErikTorenberg 8/ Such a great chance to discuss founder issues, a major problem, yet there is very little about it out there.
@ErikTorenberg 7/ He talked about that in very early interviews with other media outlets, did this not send up red flags?
@ErikTorenberg 6/If they emerged, how and why do you think they did? What do you think about his manifesto about stealing from Whole Foods?
@ErikTorenberg 5/Were the problems there from beginning, or did they emerge later? If they were apparent, why did you make him a co-founder?
@ErikTorenberg 4/ If it was the final straw, what were some other things that caused problems?
@ErikTorenberg 3/Whats the real story? Was it really one incident, or was that just the final straw?
@ErikTorenberg 2/ The media story is that it was b/c of the Elliott Rodger manifesto annotation, but he had many smaller issues before that
@ErikTorenberg lets see 1/was Mahbod forced out of Genius, or did he leave voluntarily? If so, why?
@ErikTorenberg they may not want to talk about it, but i'd love to hear extended discussion of all issues w/Mahbod. So much to talk about
@KySportsRadio @KAdkins93 the shirt was made in China. They don't know us teams

@MarcyJMiller @johndurant @Vision365 Seven Nation Army?
@andrewmurano @johndurant eh. Palestinians. Whatever. We all oppress someone.
@johndurant @andrewmurano that army sounds awesome. The Israeli women I've met are hot smart and cool. I'm in.
@andrewmurano @johndurant for real? I had no idea. I know the Kurd army has a ton of badass female fighters
@johndurant an army that does a lot of fucking I bet.
@johndurant what army is 50% women?
@Sev7nBrain all the evidence says it does
@cgreene_30 yeah I need to tweet faster. Obvious jokes go quick
@poloshot ugh. The good jokes are always taken quickly.
@kamalravikant @trengriffin Me too. But yeah, Omid has never directly told me how they decide. I think its part metrics, part "art"
@kamalravikant @trengriffin he's la
@kamalravikant @trengriffin I've introduced you to Omid Ashtari, haven't I?
@kamalravikant @trengriffin Kamal, you know I am good friends with the guy who verifies Twitter accounts, right?

@SObedih @nisselson we can do it in the uk right now. Same language, same publishing process
@dcurtis let me know. Also doing the chicken/lamb dinner at Ma Peche Saturday night.
@dcurtis http://t.co/b5yJQ1BXZe
@dcurtis Dude, I'm in NYC. Doing the Ribeye Dinner at Ssam Bar on Sunday night if you want in. We literally have an extra spot.
@AndrewWarner At some point, I'd love you and Jeremy to look at our process and see what notes you have, I bet you can make it even better
@AndrewWarner Andrew! I've been meaning to email you, your interview course really helped us systematize this process.
@shloky @chrisguillebeau yes. Helps it ferment. Fda won't let them ship it as actual kombucha
@charliehoehn isn't my title great. I'm a genius :)
@dakid97 @Amanda_Murphy yes cheaper model is possible. We're going to roll it out next year. 100x cheaper
@TampaHammer @BizDataSystems best ever? I don't know. I'll take "amazing and incredible" and be happy about it.
@paulg That's a real thing. It's called The Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect, so named by Michael Crichton: http://t.co/JhlFlfo8MX
@ramit you're 100% right, and its shocking how few people understand any of this. No academic Ive ever met gets it.
@SeanKosednar 3/which would reduce the price by 100x at least.
@SeanKosednar 2/ Also, we definitely want to make this cheaper. We're examining rolling this out as a software as a service,
@SeanKosednar You don't need to use us to use this process. What we do can be done by anyone, though it takes longer of course
@SeanKosednar You think making books easier for people to create is MORE elitist?
@boneill1621 What do you mean my evaluation?
The embarrassing story about how a woman (correctly) calling me out led to my new start-up:  https://t.co/A6MvJMuT9h
@johndurant don't need to wait 20 years. A few minutes with both is enough
@sama and none of those critiques have any actual understanding of the situation or facts involved. Happens to everyone in public eye
@jasonmcamps that can't be a real article
@ChrisRyanPhD that case study sucks, misses the point--she's not into him. stop sweating her and talk to girls who are
@UnmistakableCEO @saulofhearts there's nothing for me to take. Arguing with fools only makes you foolish
@BadAssPaleo its true. People have no idea how important sleep is to everything that matters in mating; intelligence, emotions, health, etc
@charliehoehn that article only scratches the surface of Gottmans research. You should check his books out.
@balajis Catholic Church imploding, going bankrupt, splintering into small independent sects
@paulg thats how media makes money--creating news/commentary appealing to  human desire to consume social information and status signal
@vhmnt yes I did. Excited to try your gear out.
@joshuajordison damnit super busy forgot going up tomm
@dopeters haha...no
@notmikedunleavy no no no. Moonshine is UK. Meth is UL.
@LukasKawerau No. Though Helen Fishers books are amazing, and I highly recommend them
@SiCAtNite try the ruby red. It's amazing.
@cbingel @alaindebotton No no--those are all buildings devoted to the same thing: the production of commerce.
@Wyatt_Goodtimes absolutely correct. Interesting question that hasn't been fully studied
@MelissaLim the only bad part is that I'm not on Tinder
@JohnGarvens @NilsAParker we are. It'll be funny.
@ChrisSpoke @pmarca haha--then keep listening to it. Music preference not the same as social/econ policy
@pmarca &amp; the ppl who reminisce about good old days are powerful who grew up in privileged bubble or current powerful controling others
@Big_Dave_Allan no--the book was driving too much of the business I don't want. I can give you a free copy if you want. Just email me.
@Big_Dave_Allan yep. Another project took off, couldn't give bs time
@dcurtis that would be a great blog post topic, "where I disagree with Peter Thiel." I'd read it.
@BuckyIsotope Does that graphic include playoff and playoff clinching games? And where is the 4th quarter interceptions graphic?
All Cowboy haters should be stoked about their winning streak. Romo is setting them up for the greatest Romo of all time
@BuckyIsotope This is an exciting year for Cowboys haters. It's setting up for the greatest Romo ever. It will top all previous Romos
@BuckyIsotope Be careful getting to excited about the Cowboys rise to the sun, Icarus. Those wings have melted every single year...
@johndurant @rnikoley @BodyForWife scrub toilets for wife, save a ho for wife, be a barista for wife, icy hot stunnaz for wife
@pmarca This is the basic idea of signaling theory and status competition. This book is a good intro: http://t.co/7804LO3eVg
@JohnGarvens you don't have to be clean shaven. beards and scruff is fine--groomed means you look taken care of, not scraggly
@JohnGarvens shaving is part of grooming.
@laurenikay I would love to, but I have a girlfriend. I starred it to check it out, I advise one of the big companies in this space
@NilsAParker You need to give a trigger warning when you say "tighten up" to ND boys.
@dcurtis rapid death?
@johnrobb Any subject where people attach personal identity to the issue (consciously or unconsciously), makes it not about issues
@johnrobb Guns. Abortion. Welfare. Equality. Affirmative Action.
@WillHinsa great idea. thats the point of speed dating
@johnrobb Ello already took venture money. They're doa
@hunterwalk @Cinnabon Ive been eating paleo for a decade. Cinnabon is my mortal enemy &amp; follows me around the internet taunting me
@michaelianblack that is how the 99% lives. My thoughts and prayers go out to you in your time of suffering.
@lazerdoov That would be awesome if it was true. That would show my dad I'm tough!
@nikcastro2 he's fine. On social media hiatus I think
@johndurant what? No! Do you know what the byproduct of bacteria eating sugar is? ALCOHOL. That's how fermentation works
@War_Lizard youre right I my free time reading obscure comment threads on reddit to get tweet ideas. Just like you apparently do.
@War_Lizard that's not what my idea is.
@CuveeCoffee haha, my first time pissing someone off by asking for directions. see what happens when I'm vulnerable!
@CuveeCoffee FYI--Google Maps still has your location on 7th. I had to ask another coffee shop where you were. They were displeased w/me.
@CuveeCoffee just visited cafe for the first time--awesome. beautiful &amp; warm design, baristas were great, coffee was amazing. great job.
@DrewFranklinKSR @KySportsRadio You need to talk about this piece, we all know coach K is a slimeball, he nails it: http://t.co/UE0zOvmek2
@KySportsRadio Miss America isn't humor to me. I've slept with too many pageant girls. It create PTSD flashbacks
@KySportsRadio Dude, you're watching Miss America when there is football on. Have some self respect.
@BuckyIsotope I'm too embarrassed by the NFL to have a team anymore. I just root for everyone to have fun.
@BuckyIsotope No no, that's all wrong. The dog would intercept the keys and run them into the neighbors yard for a TD.
@TWoody1x the only things he said that make sense were those things--where he was quoting someone else
Ray Lewis speaking = "word salad." Hes very emphatic and persuasive, until you analyze his actual statements &amp; realize they are nonsense
@sama @DanielZarick @mobiusbobs @bhorowitz No, it was cash. The song is called C.R.E.A.M. for that acronym
@PQFive @sportspickle oh shit no. My bad.
@housedoc4041 ask the girls he's raped if it's old for them
Hey @nfl, just an FYI: when Tucker Max calls you morally bankrupt, you're a heaping pile of festering shit.
@charles_a_cox go read the police report on the smoking gun and then throw your fucking bullshit homerism into one of the three rivers
If you think Ray Rice is bad, don't google the crimes of the Steelers QB. Hitting girls is maybe the fifth worse thing he's done to them
Some people are shocked to see ravens fans in ray rice jerseys. You know they built a statue for a murderer, right?
@vgr best way to avoid this is train for real fighting. MMA. She even says it in the piece.
@dcurtis Steve jobs is dead. Apple is just another company now.
No issue with Ray Rice punishment. Makes sense. Ray Lewis criticizing him? I couldn't dream of more preposterous lack of self-realization
Did Ray Lewis take the moral high road talking about Ray Rice? RAY LEWIS KILLED A MAN. This is insanity.
@LukasKawerau hahahaha--that's good. If it works, it works
@charliehoehn Not if you're in shape. Then its in the 50's
@CheJ629 There is no excuse for it. Catholics and Penn Staters are both awful, and both institutions should be shut down.
@CheJ629 The catholic church invented wide spread little boy fucking &amp; abuse coverups. Penn State are amateurs compared to them
@CheJ629 yeah ND is good at pushing shit in. Especially the shit of little boys
@NilsAParker trip wire a small boy w/a claymore &amp; take out the entire ND administration. trip wire a drunk St Marys girl, the football team
@NilsAParker They'd never get in one. Unless it was to shoot at the team from a better vantage point, which agree is just good sniper craft
I'd consider rooting for ISIS if they played Notre Dame, so today I'm definitely a big Michigan fan
@AmandaMidge @JSJdarling that is my video.
@arianna @jaltucher 11 Madison park. Best by far
@johndurant @ESPNStatsInfo It started with Tara Reid. She moved in with him in 05, I think. Maybe 04.
@feelymyeley yep
@Pv @Loh Then they complain how no one laughed at their jokes, and never mention the anything about the restaurant.
@Pv @Loh The best are these, "I'm the type of person who likes to joke around with servers, and I think my sense of humor is really good."
@johndurant Well, border collies do require attentive, alpha owners. I've always done great with them.
@johndurant border collie, blue heeler (cattle dog), and lots of mixes are good
@BoobsRadley blood relative. Because then maybe you could stay friends.
@LukasKawerau @avflox that's a really good piece. its true, most guys don't get that women often feel physically vulnerable around them
@ericaRedline zero. I live in Austin
@SamInteractive @olly_ocarroll Sort of. Revised &amp; Updated Edition in 2009.
@SamInteractive @olly_ocarroll My book was published in 2006. Reading is fundamental.
@johnrobb Because that doesn't make bankers rich
@MichaelSoloway too much ripping &amp; tearing. BTW have a pic with a certain baby in a certain shirt to email you later
It's a sign your priorities are shifting when you spend more time on @BarkBuddy than you do on @HingeApp or @Tinder
@davidstehle @LewisHowes I never said it didn't
@johndurant GLUTEN!!!
@JuryReporter can't go this year. Sucks. Back next year
@sama @mccarthyryanj agreed. Just saying the internet is a platform that reflects actual public opinion. Not media entity controlling it
@sama @mccarthyryanj the internet is not in control of public opinion. It is the platform that reflects it.
@jasonmcamps  Hey! Have you tried Hinge? It's in Austin http://t.co/BdR5zte00g
@AmberTozer second question: do you want protect or shoot at black people?
@GeorgieBeHumble Real entrepreneurs are not in school. They are making things people want.
@kamalravikant Their own power
@kamalravikant @danielgarrott Just dont try to disagree civilly with the Ferguson police. You don't have that right in Ferguson.
@TZack23 there was one yesterday and today. New ones every day this week
@charliehoehn we've been using freelancers on elance, half the price of speechpad and better results. Ask Zach for referrals.
I answer the question I get more than any other: Why do women like assholes? http://t.co/fgm26on5oh
@bdm105 we usually charge between 6k and 10k. But Im writing a short ebook that explains how to do it yourself as well if thats too much
@PeakofTresChic @ChrisRyanPhD chris definitely knows his shit.
@CDRawesome ahahahhaha--that was a pretty fucking funny line, wasn't it? It looks even better in print.
@robbwolf But Robb, how is big pharma supposed to make money if people don't buy their drugs? They can't charge people for eating right!
@juanpgargiulo p Terrys. Way better
@y20something @MatingGrounds Maybe...perhaps too charismatic was the issue
@y20something @MatingGrounds Agreed, except she doesn't like me. We met once.
I just explained hentai (tentacle) porn to @nntaleb. First time I've ever seen him speechless
@nntaleb haha yeah that was good. I told her they were about altruism
@jasonmcamps KEEP YOUR FACTS OFF MY ADVANCED METRICS!!!
@colecova nope
@JonathanLittle Send me an email, tuckermax@gmail.com
@KySportsRadio Now we can stick to Bama fans in arguments!!! YOU CAN'T BEAT OUR GAME PARKING!! IT'S THE CLOSEST!! BO BIG BLUE!
@BrendanKlem @jaltucher Brendan, you can read the book the @RyanHoliday and I just wrote about book marketing: http://t.co/CnBNjJDote
@sama Not when ban the idiots. Then they get turned all the way off.
@DarrenMills go look at my angel list profile
@TuckerMax I meant "when" and not "why." Thinking is hard.
@KYLCHLTN starting that soon
@tferriss @ohhh_canada @kevinrose that all depends on the type of girls you hang out with
@lawlballz @drywallsarcasm @johndurant @EpicBeastmode satire is not trolling. Very different.
@drywallsarcasm @lawlballz @johndurant 2/ Writers create. Trolls destroy or inflict misery. Like calling abortion doctor a murderer.
@drywallsarcasm @lawlballz @johndurant 1/ The only people who call a creator/writer a troll are trying to win an implied status contest.
@drywallsarcasm @lawlballz @johndurant When someone says "some people" they always mean themselves, but won't admit holding the view
@lawlballz @johndurant Either they lack it (sociopath/austism) or they have it and actively want to hurt others (sadist).
@lawlballz @johndurant I'm not sure about that. They may understand it. It's more about emotional connection.
@johndurant Ie, there are no sociopathic or autistic comedians. But that is most trolls.
@johndurant I bet not. Comedy is inherently personal (delivery on stage) and empathic (have to understand people). That study is opp traits
@Michael101690 Glad its helping. we've recorded about 40+ episodes already, and many of the best ones are coming I think
@MikeyG_08 @Inspiring9 All good writers do at least one, many of the very best do both
@WakehamNick all free, of course: https://t.co/9DP6BNJGxh
@HarmlessPill Yeah dude, we already have a podcast up, and the book is coming: http://t.co/4XUBnzSosy
@HarmlessPill We don't have a book called that. I have no idea where you got that idea.
@VA2UK he coached at Duke you moron
@TZack23 They come every Monday and Wednesday
I thought Steve Spurrier played his college football at Florida, not Penn State: https://t.co/rg2u65FBjY via @vineapp
@DrewFranklinKSR dude, he even does a JERKOFF MOTION! What is wrong with him? I thought he played at Florida, not Penn State?
@Miss_Berry_ That is indeed a picture of me, but not me. Tons of Tinder accounts are bots
@JakeWythers @IsabelBehncke Isn't she awesome? I was the same way
@steph_louiex3 All detailed here: http://t.co/pUsXp0q7gS
@therealgiggz yes go to http://t.co/y0IgcdFmpr
@JCrahan I like it with club soda and lemon
@yahsciencebitch I add anyone who requests. You requested me.
@BillSimmons Simmons I bid 5k, but I'm pretty sure they wont let me on ESPN anyway. @MatthewBerryTMR couldnt even get me on his podcast
@jasonmcamps Not a good ROI, I don't think
Heat fans, the proper response to Lebron going to Cleveland is the same thing you did at his game: leave early &amp; get coked up at a club.
So when does Germany get really dickish, and put Air Bud in the game?
So if the Germans beat the French at soccer, do we have to save them from that defeat too?
@paulg When ideas/concepts become embedded in identity and confer status to the holder
Our World Cup run was so fun, it doesnt matter who wins or loses. It's not like its football or basketball or something that matters
I BELIEVE THAT I WILL USE SOCCER AS AN EXCUSE TO DAY DRINK, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT IT!
@karmacom @ZNotik Exactly. You don't think you have to respect my preferences, but demand that I respect yours.
@karmacom @ZNotik So it's OK for you to not respect my clothing choices, but you expect me to respect your clothing expectations for me?
@ZNotik @karmacom Thats contradicting. You know that "having a great sense of fashion" is a statement, right?
@Ugly_Jesus email me tuckermax@Gmail.com
@ZNotik @karmacom yep. The only people who wear suits are those who have to.
@tferriss Gangs of New York
@DrBondar Agreed, great time. I am still laughing at the guy who took a stereo system to Mexico
@BrianCox18 Read the book, not really about increasing testosterone, about getting healthy so your hormones get to appropriate levels
@BrianCox18 No. How could it?
@juanpgargiulo Well, it's on TFM today. That should get some attention:  http://t.co/vOrYHyLODF
@jokeocracy dont make the mistake of assuming everyone knows what you know. Ive found that to rarely be the case
@balajis tons of research on this in ev &amp; psych fields, usually called "signaling theory." Check out Robin Hanson @ Overcoming Bias too
@Tee_Jay2016 I usually charge anywhere from 10-20k for a speech.
@Tee_Jay2016 money
@andrewchen Actually, they usually say "Cambridge." And I've met 1 Hardvard grad who went more than 5 minutes before dropping their H bomb
@HungryCL @SAI @tferriss haha that's funny. Not even a guy lying about being me. It was a girl.
@sportslady37 @KySportsRadio If the UK baseball team worth something that indicated sexual activities, yes, we would
@KySportsRadio I dunno. According to the softball player I hooked up with last year, it still does. There are secondary signals though
@KySportsRadio Hey dude--you know what the bows signal, right?
@eli_kurland @mmamania Good piece. I remember him starting BJJ. Its such a great sport, so helpful to so many people
@shloky Remember, Jobs is dead. Apple is now just a normal corporation, with normal corporate thought
@shloky Yeah, but few people know that. Perception is Beats = high quality. Plus licensing/celeb angle is big for music.
@shloky It's about Android. They are losing that war, and they need to find a way to compete. Fighting Android is like fighting entropy
@DuckT0nes No one can get a psychopath laid. Except a credit card.
@clairlemon Claire, your diagnosis is right on. 90% of the people talking about this are just yelling about their agenda, not about facts
@sportspickle Those are their real names!! I thought you were kidding. BTW--at least 80% are huge fans of my books. That's sadly not a joke
@SeannyRotten @johndurant @drdrew That's also indicative of NPD combined with sociopathology/possibly also aspergers
@ChrisRyanPhD @johndurant Not capitalism. Consumerism. Not the same thing. One is a way to trade. One is a source of meaning.
@SeannyRotten @johndurant he even says they "would've" rejected him. Not about women or sex or that. Pure narcissism, cloaked in sex
@SeannyRotten @KCKARP @johndurant Prob not borderline. Very rare in men. Definitely NPD. Like I said, this is about him, not about women
@KCKARP @johndurant in my opinion, not Asperger's, but a sociopath &amp; narcissist. They can look similar. Either way, obv mentally ill
@johndurant difference is rejection is an event. Status is a state of being. Like difference between guilt and shame
@johndurant no. They are different. ven diagrams very similar but not the exact same
@johndurant right. Remember that being rejected and being low status not always same thing. He was rejected, not low status. Narcissism
@johndurant but you're totally right that guys getting laid don't kill. Why Islam can find suicide bombers so easily
@johndurant it's never that simple with narcissist rage killings. This was a good looking dude with a BMW. Not low status
@johndurant which makes me wonder what the whole story is. There will be way more to come out on this.
@johndurant holy shit I thought you were kidding. That article is real. I bet the full story there is amazing. Watch how press spins this
@johndurant you mean etiquette is not the way to a woman's heart? Not on my watch sir!
@austinnotary Lived here for 5 years now.
@johndurant get your white male privilege out of my timelime!
@Triplet_Tyler Bravo. Well done.
@jasonmcamps Thats it! Thats the wallet that will make my life complete!
@CuveeCoffee Been drinking your coffee since I moved to Austin 5 years ago. Excited to see the cafe.
@DrewFranklinKSR started at the bottom now im...in Cleveland?
ESPN reported the Browns drafted Manziel bc *a homeless guy told the owner to do it.* That isn't a joke. Cleveland is its own punchline
I guess God hates Johnny Maziel more than most people do
@sama Sam, media doesnt care about truth or even accuracy. they care about creating a reaction that drives pageviews &amp; pleasing advertisers
@AaronBurdette Who has a physical persence? This is the internet.
@AaronBurdette @twitter pic or it didn't happen
@RyanHoliday true. Sorry I didn't mean to start the peanut gallery critiquing that quote.
@RyanHoliday Actually there is, "Genius is the ability to see connections others don't see." Thats the more common definition
@nntaleb @RyanHoliday @johndurant @tferriss @kevin2kelly Of course. I'd do anything for Seth
@RyanHoliday @nntaleb @johndurant @tferriss @omid @kevin2kelly I wrote a small tribute as well. This is so sad: http://t.co/BC5kMml7EH
@johndurant @robbwolf Is Seth Roberts really dead? What the hell? This is fucking awful
@johndurant Dude, I'm going to hound you about this until you do. Just like I wouldn't leave you alone about it when you were here.
@hueykwik @tferriss you're right dude. I'll go kill a drifter and take his corner. Thanks for the inspiration!
@tferriss fyi--cleopatra took the throne by having her sister killed by Romand and brother strangled by palace guards
@UKCoachCalipari I told you that you'd debut Top 5. You didn't believe me!!
Sincere best wishes to Boston for the Marathon. I also sincerely hope all Boston sports teams lose every game they ever play
@recomphacks @PaleoFX @robbwolf fair? they dont fight fair. Why should I?
@recomphacks @PaleoFX @robbwolf The problem is that I really like Robb. I'd rather fight a vegan or a Monsanto exec or something
@ReadingRecs what should I read next? I like Tucker max
@sportingnews @UKCoachCalipari Cal and I are the two best one and done recruiters in the nation
@KySportsRadio matt were with the red ventures guys and they are pissed yout didn't mention them too ;)
@KySportsRadio just listened to Cal discuss Draft and 1 &amp; done rule with Jordan. MJ says Silver will push 2 yr rule http://t.co/zIeBl8LA0O
@TurkeyHunterKSR I prefer Succeed And Proceed. Out my door
Me and @UKCoachCalipari  on our way to see the Bobcats and Bulls tonight. He travels in style http://t.co/cKGDVUDBz6
@dpinsen @johndurant @matingmind He has tenure. Has had it for a long time.
@noahkagan You are a disgusting sit-wiper; don't try to use Twitter to alleviate your shame
@MaxWendkos @davemcclure I've invested in #500startups companies (e.g. #partender). Not unexpected at all, Dave runs a great operation
@davemcclure the problem isnt what youre doing at all, its how youre telling the story.
@KySportsRadio How could a white walk-on not graduate? What other possible purpose does he serve on the team?
@Darcy_Lussier @AdamMGrant You're ruining my reputation Adam :)
@Darcy_Lussier The @TuckerMax twitter got hacked. He tweeted a business book promoting "why helping others drives our success"@AdamMGrant :)
@Aurini you heard about it indirectly b/c its alpha stage, very little is on there as of now, theres nothing to launch
@DoctorIllusion well done piece. Good job.
@DoctorIllusion Arguing over meaningless semantics accomplishes nothing for anyone. What we are doing is new, you'll see.
@DoctorIllusion This whole issue over a non-issue is ridiculous, I cant even follow the thread anymore, twitters not the place for nuance.
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC I should say, "I attacked PUA's and anything dressed up like PUAs" to be precise. But same point
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC Exactly. I attacked PUAs. I said nothing about Mano. So we basically agree. Yet we're arguing why?
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC Do you disagree that a lot of manosph is just that? I bet if I looked at your site, that exact complaint is there
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC Whatever, this whole convo is ridiculous. We're arguing over ghosts &amp; non-issues. I'm going to stop.
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC No. You're parsing my words to find an issue thats not there. If my intent was attacking you/mano directly, I would
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC using outrage porn to attack image, not issue. Why not just reserve judgment until you have something to discuss?
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC funny, youre doing to me what so much of the manosphere rightfully complains about: defining into marginalization&amp;
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC Your advice might be fantastic. I have no idea. I do know that what we are going to do, does not currently exist
@DoctorIllusion @LaidNYC I didnt deny your existence. We're doing something different. How can you deny that b/f you see it?
@DrewFranklinKSR drew, papa doc lost that rap battle. Might want to pick a different movie quote
Is there anything more satisfying than watching Duke lose a basketball game? No idea where or who Mercer is, but America thanks you
@Scarred_Tissue @LaidNYC oh yes. What were doing doesn't exist right now. I'm not sure why you're getting so defensive. I never mention you
This is who you meet at sxsw: fat storm troopers http://t.co/1XKMU0iueO
When celeb sites say actresses sizzle on the red carpet, they mean that an anorexic had pointy elbows &amp; a vacant, hollow look on her face

My favorite part about the Oscars is where I don't give a crap about any of it. So exciting and glamorous!

@Tenneyson You're in a good position. Once you learn how to tell your story and sell your vision, you'll do great
@Tenneyson My pleasure. Its hard to hear difficult truths, but thats how you grow &amp; get better, by fixing the things that aren't working
The only thing that can save this opening ceremony is Putin saying "if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change!"
@thelastpsych Am I drunk or did I just hear Bob Dylan ask me to buy a Chrysler?
@tferriss I told you this YEARS ago brother. It's funny, you're moving into entertainment and I'm leaving and going to tech.
Best part of the game is that @CoachBillSelf gave me better seats than @aaronrodgers12. Eat that Packer fans! http://t.co/B8zFZnvEBl
At UK @UKCoachCalipari put me 2nd row. At KU, @CoachBillSelf put me 1st row. Gotta step it up Cal, Im from Kentucky
@pmarca Marc, that whole line of copy that is attributed to Jordan was actually written by Nike ad people. Just an FYI.
Kyle Orton did a great job backing up Tony Romo. He even threw his game ending interception for him!
A backwoods hunter from Louisiana has intolerant views on gays and minorities? How could this be? Who could possibly have predicted this?

@RaymondDuke thats clever. I prefer being right, but what do I know about success?
@RaymondDuke dude...youre lost. You really need to read more if you think this. Your worldview is much smaller than you realize
@RaymondDuke whole point is 20th century advertising is "you aren't good enough, but our product will make you whole"
@RaymondDuke no, advertising creates false needs &amp; meets those. what need does anything advertised in a fashion magazine meet?
@RaymondDuke If you think that, you're very naive. Always been about the needs of the company, not of people
@macdanzigmma every athlete I know that is paleo is NOT low carb. You can be paleo and eat carbs; fruits, startches, etc.
@KySportsRadio @ClaytonAnderson definitely. At the IU camp, I haven't stopped mocking their sweet 16 rings
@AdamMGrant assumption was only gullible get hustled. I think its reverse, Only hyper vigilant w/outsized sense of justice catch hustlers
@AdamMGrant proves my point. Madoff  hustled smartest people on earth out of 19 billion. Took a decade to catch him &amp; only one dude saw it
@AdamMGrant another option: dominatrix. Their clients don't pay for sex, they pay for a type of therapy and psychological escape/relief
@AdamMGrant assumption is off. to a hustler, anyones gullible w/right lever to pull. Madoffs victims all educated and sophisticated w/money
@AdamMGrant no way. The professional con man/hustler knows people the best. They have to
@charliehoehn precisely. If you can convince other people, then it has to be true, right?
Obama is starting a war, the stock market is about to collapse &amp; Ben  fucking Affleck is Batman...I dont care, bc FOOTBALL IS FINALLY HERE
I didn't understand why zombie movies were popular until I went to Costco on a weekend
Tebow released from Patriots. WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW TEBOW? Oh right, he's indifferent to meaningless athletics contests. Also, nonexistent.
I wonder who has better accuracy out of the gun; Tom Brady or Aaron Hernandez?
You know you've really missed football when you're legitimately excited to watch a PRESEASON Raiders/Bengals game
Maybe Riley Cooper was just singing along with the Kenny Chesney lyrics?
He used the N-word while attending a Kenny Chesney concert, &amp; Riley Cooper is STILL the least offensive person in Philadelphia
I don't get the people who oppose gay marriage--don't you want more events where you are SUPPOSED to get drunk and hook up?
Paul George just broke Lebrons ankles, then dunked on Birdman. My basketball fantasies aren't even that amazing
@JimmyConrad I didn't slam soccer. I only said soccer is a game invented by European women to pass the time while husbands cooked dinner
Im afraid to ever tweet again. I got punked by a guy who took an hour to type three letters RT @realmikefox Smh
Oh my god. Thats a real tweet. Mike, you've left me more speechless than Muhammad Ali  RT @realmikefox Smh
The @realmikefox account would be way better if every tweet was "smh"
I misread the headlines that Tim Tebow came out as gay. Which makes perfect sense. Instead he's out of football. Which also makes sense.
Boston, great job &amp; super glad you're all safe. But I still hate all your sports teams and actively root against them, like all Americans
The only Harlem Shake video I'll watch is Montel Williams trying to walk down stairs
If you enjoy watching Harlem Shake videos, don't ever complain about "stupid people." You're one of them
Someone just asked me to be in a Harlem Shake video. Whats the best way to hide a dead body?
Any hot African-American girls around? Trying to knock out Valentines Day and Black History Month all at once.
If this power outage really is Bane, this will be the best Superbowl ever
I wonder if its awkward in the Ravens huddle when Ray Lewis screams, "Lets kill em!"
I don't know why people want to ban assault rifles. Guns don't kill people. Ray Lewis kills people.
In College Station for UK/TAMU. Is this whole town Section 8 housing? This place is like El Paso without the ambition
So happy Ray Lewis gets to take a stab at a second Super Bowl #felonymurder
Ok people, that's enough Manti Teo jokes. We're beating a dead girlfriend
I'm not going to call it masturbating anymore, now I'm "fucking Manti Teos ex-girlfriend."
Halloween costume idea: Tell everyone you're coming to a party. Don't show up. You're Manti Teos girlfriend
Manti Teo made the classic guy mistake: he tried to turn a (fake) hoe into a (fake) housewife.
Bravo. Slow clap. RT @NOLA_tom_lupo maybe "girlfriend" is some Hawaiian slang for "Notre Dames run defense". Because that shit was a hoax.
A fake dead girl is preferable to any actual Notre Dame girl I've ever met, so I kinda get Manti Teos thinking
Alabama, don't worry theres nothing fake about AJ McCarrons girlfriend (except for her tits, but thats a good thing)
Manti Teo played at Notre Dame, why'd someone at a homophobic catholic football school fake a girlfriend?? Oh, riiiight...
People super angry at Lance Armstrong: Yes he cheated &amp; lied...about riding a bicycle in France. Get some perspective
I used to say it takes a lot of balls to publicly admit you cheated, but Lance Armstrong proved it only takes one
I thought Notre Dame boys would know how to fight back when someone is ramming it down their throat. Guess not.
Norte Dame fans are mad, saying I should die. So I guess they want me to film a Notre Dane football practice?
Not a Bama fan, but Im against priest sex abuse, rape cover-ups &amp; killing your students for football. So tonight, ROLL TIDE! #fucktheirish
My last tweet wasn't really a joke. Notre Dame is the most evil institution in America (other than Penn State, of course). Fuck'em.
ND fan "We're gonna crush Bama tonight!" Me "The only thing ND has ever crushed is a videographer with a scissor lift." #fucktheirish
Its not that I dislike hockey--I just don't care about it. You know, like pretty much every other American.
Hockey is back! Wait...hockey was gone? Sweet, now I can not watch actual hockey games, instead of canceled ones
No matter how many gifts I get, none ever contain what I was secretly hoping for: Gwenyth Paltrow's head
I dont understand why anyone would shoot an innocent child. Especially because there are so many deserving adults out there.
Im starting a tampon company. The slogan, "We're not the greatest thing in the world, but we're up there. Strings attached."

@JayBilas Jay, you do realize Waldo is hiding b/c he's a dead beat dad &amp; wont pay child support, right?
@EnderTL The eye is missing NYC. And if you're taking WEATHER ADVICE from Tucker Max, you deserve to die.

Good luck to all the east coast people threatened by the hurricane (except Yankee fans and annoying Brooklyn hipsters)
Baylor put up 700+ yards, scored 63 points AND LOST. And here I was thinking the French had the worst defense in history
If youre a fan of offensive football, turn on the WVU/Baylor game. This is a "Charlie Sheen in a whorehouse" amount of scoring
@UKCoachCalipari It was an amazing experience, one of the coolest weekends of my life, thanks again Coach
@KySportsRadio @DrewFranklinKSR It sucks that I'm still the only Kentuckian who can score in the Swamp.
@PaulBiancardi Coach, just wanted to thank you again for this weekend, you and Jeff Sheppard were awesome coaches, made the camp for us.
As with everything in life, pretty girls are always welcome. Everyone else...life is hard and unfair.
If you're at the UK football game, I'm going to be tailgating right by Gate 1. The Calipari Experience tailgate.
@KySportsRadio @DrewFranklinKSR hahaha--look at this!!! http://t.co/0Cu0RHvp
@KelleeMarston an attractive girl looking for me is never creepy. Dudes and fat girls--yes, super creepy
@LDAWGGG17 Lindsey, obv you're right...but if you're expecting randoms on Twitter to not be idiots, you're in for lots of disappointment
Just heard a 60 year old cab driver in Lexington, KY properly use "YOLO" in a sentence. So that word is now thankfully over.
Nothing against the US Open, but I'd rather lick an unwashed asshole than watch tennis on TV. Or play it. Or be involved with it at all.
New football season, same Tony Romo. Don't ever change Romo, don't ever change--signed, all other NFL Teams
"I don't care that football season starts tonight!" said the girl who's very confused about why shes now in the hallway
@DrewFranklinKSR I still keep expecting to see a "stop snitching" sign at a penn state game. At least that'd be honest
@jermaya how about the kids that got raped? No thought of them moving on is there? Fuck u and your evil school
@DrewFranklinKSR "to commemorate institutional silence on child rape, please be silent again"
Penn St fans, don't feel bad you lost today. Just ignore it and pretend it didn't happen, like JoePa used to do with child rape
@JeanGreasy @levarburton This morning if someone told me Jean Grae &amp; Levar Burton would be looking for me, I wouldn't believe it
Why are people watching the Republican convention? What kind of monsters are they? COLLEGE FOOTBALL SEASON STARTED TODAY
I used to play hoops with President Obama in college, and wrote about what he's like as a player: http://t.co/COoQEqHG
I would say this Opening Ceremony is the worst thing Ive ever seen, but I once saw an episode of "Keeping Up w/The Kardashians"
Depressing fact about the Opening Ceremonies: These are the most attractive people in England
The Olympics opening ceremony is...I don't know how to describe it other than this was clearly made for an audience I am not a part of
@caulenwise I already blocked all the PSU defenders. I'm afraid theyre going to rape my other followers, and then pretend it didnt happen
NCAA sanctions of Penn St are a joke. You dont "punish" an institution that covers up a decade of child rape. You shut it down.
If you're upset about the Paterno statue coming down, just do what he did: tell your boss once and never mention it again
Her "How can I be sexier?" Me "I know this really sexy move you can do with your mouth. Its called ‘shutting the fuck up’"
I didn't think anything was more boring &amp; pointless than people posting pictures of food. Then came the fireworks pictures.
@ChrisCygul @JJRedick @Binkley23 Before you clowns start defending Redick, google "JJ redick poetry." Im sorry that your hero is an idiot.
@JJRedick @Binkley23 If Redick and I were at the same table for drinks, he'd leave crying.
I dont understand pilots who say theyll "make up time in the air." Motherfucker, why werent you planning going at top speed originally?
Opinions are nothing like assholes. You can't fuck an opinion.
Now Lebron has a championship, lets focus all our unreasonable expectations &amp; irrational hatred where they belong: on Tim Tebow
It seems like the people most prepared for the zombie apocalypse are the least prepared for real life
I would make a joke about Rodney King, but they've already been beaten to death
I dont like to call them one night stands. I prefer "auditions for love."
Travolta sued for assault, North Carolina bans same sex marriage &amp; now Vidal Sasson is dead? Tough week to be gay
John Travolta said he's "done things in his past that would make most people throw up." He's gotta be talking about Battlefield Earth
If you want to avoid the phrase "his pubic hair was wirey and unkempt" then don't read anything about John Travolta today
Hey people who don't understand why Max Johnson is a bad name for a girl: Congrats, you're as stupid as Jessica Simpson
Jessica Simpson named her daughter Maxwell Drew Johnson. Her daughter. She named Max Johnson. What a fucking idiot.
I tried, but I can't beat the Dick Clark joke by @DrewCurtis: "NEWS FLASH: Dick in a box"
Facebook buying Instagram for 1 billion, b/c thats what FB needs: more sepia toned bullshit from people we dont know
PETA has asked me to help fix some bitches, and I think that’s a great idea http://t.co/mQtapAfd
It's not a funny read, but I posted my views on the whole Planned Parenthood donation debacle: http://t.co/L0gJTGMe
I'm a grown man, with tears of joy because some teenagers won a basketball game. Thus goes the life of a UK fan.
My friend said holding his newborn was the greatest feeling ever. NOTE: He's never had a team in the Final Four. Go Big Blue!
I would pay big money to live in a world where drivers understood what the sign "Keep Right Except to Pass" meant
Technically, Tim Tebow is still a virgin. Getting assfucked by John Elway doesn't count as sex.
Other than sex, there is nothing better than watching Duke lose at basketball
I don't get people who oppose gay marriage. Haven't they seen lesbian porn? How can anyone reasonably be AGAINST that??
I think I could believe in immaculate conception before I could believe someone screwed Snookie without a condom
My favorite part of the Oscars is where I don't watch or care. So good.
I’m going to be real clear about this, ladies, so pay attention: Prince Charming doesn’t come to rescue cunty lunatics.
Contrary to what some assholes think, Fat Tuesday is NOT Adele's birthday. Shame on all of us who thought that.
Any hot black girls free today? Looking to knock out Valentines Day and Black History Month all at once.
If Adele runs out of awful memories to sing about, itd only take me about 8 minutes to guarantee her 3 more platinum albums
People were mad I didnt make Whitney  jokes yesterday but are saying "too soon" now? THIS IS WHY TWITTER CANT HAVE NICE THINGS
I thought I really hated the Grammys, but I got nothing on Whitney Houston. She'll do anything to get out of going.
Signs you have a problem: I heard Whitney Houston died, and my first thought was, "I gotta get on Twitter and make a joke."
Whatever girl in NYC gets to have sex with Jeremy Lin tonight is very lucky, even if she cant actually feel it
I tried to pay reality stars to promote #hilarityensues, but got banned b/c of these hilarious tweets: http://t.co/YzvJYxZY
Two new books out today: “Hilarity Ensues” in stores & “Sloppy Seconds” is FREE to download, details: http://t.co/jqRljqiD
Guidos are bad normally, but you should see them when they're drunk and celebrating a Giants win. Chimps are more civilized
Watching SB in NYC bar. Drunk Giants & Pats fans screaming at each other like savannah baboons. I died & went to football hell
Forget Madonna, Im watching Puppy Bowl @ halftime. Hoping this year a puppy gets arrested for staging unsanctioned MMA fights
Kelly Clarkson doing the national anthem? I thought the fat lady comes on when its over, not when it begins
Duke just lost to Miami at home! This is already the best SuperBowl ever!!
What SB team do I root for? A year of obnoxious Pats fans or annoying Giants fans will both be awful. How about 3rd option: mass death
Drank w/English rugby guys last night. They're beasts. Worst hangover since Jesus woke up on Easter. Honestly happy to be alive
My friend has a black dad and a ginger mom. When asked what race he is, he says "Ninjer."
They're called tagaLONGs? Ive been calling then tagalogs for years. I just thought the girl scouts sold a Filipino cookie
@NilsAParker FUCK! I should have ended the tweet with "Trick question: The kids Sandusky raped had the worst day" FUCK!!!
Great football games today. Its sad JoePa wasnt alive to see them. Its even sadder that Jerry Sandusky was
People are saying its too soon for JoePa jokes. I guess I should wait a decade to say anything, just like JoePa did
RIP JoePa. Now you finally have a legitimate reason to not say anything when a kid gets raped
Heidi Klum is divorcing Seal? I hope this doesnt leave holes in him that he can't fill.
The Packers shouldve spent more time watching film of the Giants, and less time hanging out in State Farm offices checking for discounts
Id have more confidence in the Packers if Aaron Rodgers wasn't constantly getting punked by random people buying insurance
Pats fans, Steeler fans AND Tebow fans hated my last tweet, which must mean everything was spelled correctly and it made sense
If Tebow shuts up obnoxious Patriot fans and obnoxious Steeler fans in consecutive weeks, itll be the Bibles greatest miracle
Her "No dead baby jokes. I had an abortion." Me "I made a dead baby JOKE, u made an ACTUAL dead baby & Im wrong?" Her [anger explosion]
The last time the NCAA football champ was a non-SEC school, Twitter didnt exist. What was life like then?
Watching the national championship. Its so boring, I want to geaux get a bleaux job instead
Women in Denver are not happy--Tebow wont fuck any of them, and now a pissed off Ben Roethisberger is real drunk in their city
Why do people think Im a Duke fan? I hated Duke, it sucked. The only good thing about Duke is that its 15 minutes from Chapel Hill.
It real, and by an attractive girl. I had no idea they had them at Temple RT @DanaAlyss @TuckerMax SAW MY SIGN!!!!!! http://t.co/PIKciy1n
@DanaAlyss @joeco812 That is awesome. You deserve some sort of prize. How about HPV? Just kidding, besides u prob already have it
Watching Temple/Duke game--did I really just see a sign that said, "The best thing to come out of Duke is Tucker Max"? Thats awesome
All Tebow fans who thought his lucky run would never end & cant understand why he sucks now: Google "regression to the mean"
Im honestly confused why Tebow tries so hard to win football games. Hes still a virgin. Without pussy, whats the point?
Does this Denver comeback win mean that God loves Tim Tebow, or that he hates the Chicago Bears?
If you hate your eyes and want to punish them, turn on this Monday Night Football game and watch the Jaguars play offense.
This is only for those of you I like: Happy Thanksgiving
A "Tebow" is when you're awful most of the game, but win it at the end anyway. A "Lebron" is the complete opposite
I can't believe McQuery isn't been fired. He witnessed child rape & didn't stop it or call cops. Even worse: He's a fucking ginger!
Paterno just hired a criminal defense atty. If he covered the asses of 10 yr olds this well, he wouldnt have this problem
@MensHumor Read thru your timeline--its not just me, EVERYTHING you tweet is stolen. Is this the only work you could get, Carlos Mencia?
@MensHumor how many of my tweets are you going to steal? This is the fifth that I know about.
ESPN reporter sums up ppl rioting for Paterno "We tried to interview some, but we had trouble finding ones who could form cogent thoughts."
Hey Joe Paterno: When TUCKER MAX is telling you that your moral choices are clearly wrong, you have really, REALLY, fucked up.
Paterno needs "hindsight" to know to call the cops when a child gets raped. The rest of us just need the moral compass of a human being.
@cVanderWerff Wrong. No gray area about REPORTING CHILD RAPE. You are a sick craven monster to argue otherwise
@cVanderWerff Are you actually this stupid? Paterno had no way of knowing--HE COULDNT ASK THE EYE WITNESS IN FRONT OF HIM???
@kelly_flynn @TClifton5 say anything you want about me, you still support people who COVERED UP CHILD RAPE. Makes you a monster
An older woman chasing a younger guy is called a cougar. Does this mean an older guy chasing a young boy called a Nittany Lion?
Pennsylvania's a dangerous football state. Vick in Philly, Sandusky in State College, BigBen in Pitt. Thats a (dog) murderers row of rapists
The Penn State trustees stand behind Joe Paterno and his coaches. But not in front of them. They're not children.
Paterno apologists keep telling me to shut up. You mean the same way Paterno shut up about child rape in football showers? That way?
Joe Paterno may lead the NCAA in wins, but he has a long way to go to catch Notre Dame in child rape cover-ups
I can't wait to watch the new NBC show "Dateline: To Catch A Nittany Lion...And Kind Of Do Something About It, I Guess"
Paterno apologists: "He just did his job" is called The Nuremburg Defense, b/c its what Nazi Death Camp guards said at their trials
Most coaches draw up their own plays. Looks like Joe Paterno stole some of his from the Vatcians playbook.
I shouldn't joke about the Penn State scandal, but I'm one of those weirdos who think the anal rape of a child should be reported to police
Children: If someone touches you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult. But NOT Joe Paterno.
I used to think that if you knew a child was raped, you call the cops. According to Joe Paterno, you just call your boss, and nothing else.
The town of Sandusky, Ohio just changed their name to Hitler, Ohio. Less bad press.
@greggdoyelcbs What abt McCreary (grad ast)? You SEE A CHILD RAPE, watch your bosses NOT CALL POLICE, & do nothing? How can u live w/urself?
Herman Cains the GOP presidential leader, the McRib is back, and now Kim Kardashians single? Its a good week to be black
I love how the NFL pre-game shows are debating the best 0-6 team. It's like a Turd Beauty Pageant--the winner is still a piece of shit
I cant decide which current trending topic is most likely to cause vomitting: the McRib, the Lindsay Lohan Playboy spread, or Justin Bieber
I will never understand why people get so upset at things I don't even remember saying
Guys who say "bro's before hoe's" have obviously never had their penis inside of a ho
Girl "Im NOT a slut." Me "You sure? If u told your dad how many dicks have been in your mouth, what would he say?" Crushed.
Halloween is about delicious candy, excessive drinking, and horny women dressed as sluts. This also describes Heaven.
The person who convinced women that it's fashionable to wear yoga tights as pants is a national hero.
I'd rather shit in a bag and stare at it for 2 hours, then watch the Colts play on MNF without Peyton Manning at QB
Dear NFL players: Twitter is not making you stupid. Twitter just shows the world how stupid you already were.
I don't know why Red Sox fans think I'm hating on their team. I'm not. God does that enough.
I've never been more happy to not be a Red Sox fan than right now. Wow. I bet all 28 of the Tampa Bay fans are really happy.
Hey cat people: Theres a leukemia *and* AIDS specific to cats. Dogs--nothing. Even Mother Nature prefers dogs.
WVU turned down by SEC...b/c of ACADEMICS! Tenn, Ark & MissSt are in SEC--theyre equal to prison schools. WVU is WORSE? Close it down
Always good for a hilarious freak out during sex: Rub the girls belly and whisper, "I'm gonna put a baby in there."
Hey fat guy in Whole Foods: You aren't fooling anyone.
Ladies, FYI: If a guy compliments a part of your anatomy, it's because he wants to shoot a huge load there.
Just saw a hot girl delivering pizza. NOT in porn--for an actual job. The American economy is worse than we realize
Just took a huge dump. It smelled so bad, my dog barked at the toilet for an hour.
The main reason I check Twitter everyday is b/c I dont wanna miss the meltdown when Justin Bieber finally admits hes gay
Masturbation is never better than having sex with a girl...but its often better than dealing with all that girls bullshit.
Call me a pussy if you want, but I openly cried at the two pictures at the top of this story: http://t.co/Q9g6sW3
FOOTBALL SEASON IS FINALLY STARTING! People say having kids is the greatest thing ever. I don't think they are football fans.
Khloe Kardashian may be huge, but at least shes a good person. Her and the rest of the Wild Things were so kind to little Max
Lamar got a deal marrying Khloe Kardashian; for one diamond ring, he gets a wife AND bodyguard. Downside: fist fights over leftovers
No way Khloe Kardashian has same father as her sisters. The mom cheated with a bulldozer or mountain gorilla or something massive
Saw Khloe Kardashian in LA. SHE IS HUGE. Hows she not an NFL offensive lineman? You'd have to leave the stadium to get around her
@HarveyLevinTMZ thanks for the compliment. I love your show. Except for the blonde surfer douche
Just bought my first lululemon shirt. Do I have to do yoga and be gay now, or is that optional?
@BeisnerKSR Wait--U compared my twitter to UL's bball history? Both revolve around sex with skanks, abortions, and comedy. Makes sense.
I can't be the only one sending congratulations to Amy Winehouse for making it through her first week of sobriety
It sucks Amy Winehouse is dead, but if ur shocked a self-destructive drug addict died young--ur a fucking moron. Actions have consequences.
Well Amy Winehouse, I guess that IS a way to avoid rehab
Planned Parenthood would be cooler if it was a giant flight of stairs, w/someone pushing girls down, like a water park slide #FF @PPact
We win WWII, they win the women's World Cup. Were even now Japan.
I can't believe Pikachu scored on Han Solos daughter. Terrible.
If that awesome goal by @alexmorgan13 doesn't lead to her getting 250k for a nude pictorial, then whats the point of America?
Even with hot ass girls like @alexmorgan13 & @hopesolo running around, soccer is still boring as shit
B/c of @hopesolo, Im up early Sunday morning...to watch women's soccer. This is absolute proof that a hot girl can get me do anything.
Not the way to get out of a ticket: Cop "U been arrested before?" TM "Oh yes." Cop "What for?" TM "Being awesome."
Her:"If you love it, set it free" Me:"Exactly! So why do girls make such a big deal out of me fucking lots of other girls?"
Hey old people: Do you not realize how slow you drive, or are you just being a fucking asshole on purpose?
Vancouver loses the Stanley Cup, so fans destroy their OWN city?? HAHHAHAHA--oh Canada. You'll always be the little brother.
Now we know why LeBron didn't want to go to college: He knew he'd fail The Finals
Normally, I love the city of Miami--but the Mavericks beating the Heat felt like when Luke Skywalker destroyed the Death Star
I guess LeBron was right, "Not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7..." Zero is not any of those.
This is why I don't fuck 18 yr olds anymore: Her"I bring alot to the table!" Me"OK, like what?" Her"I...don't know."
@Sal3919 You go ahead spell every word perfectly, I'm going to be busy over here, selling millions of books
This spelling bee is depressing "Career goal: Opthamologist" WTF? YOURE 11 YEARS OLD! Who dreams of cutting eyes open @ 11?
Her: "Oh my god, you forgot to flush!" Me: "I didn't forget. I left it there to show you who's boss."
So the Rapture is when the people who hate alcohol, sex, and cursing on TV get taken away from earth? Sounds great to me
Is there anything more depressing than a dead mall? Well, I guess a dead baby in the dumpster behind a dead mall
Girl:"My fav band is the backstreet boys, my fav tv show is gossip girl and my fav book is yours!" Me:"I've failed as a human."
Huge tornado hits Tuscaloosa, levels everything EXCEPT Bryant-Denny Stadium. Ridiculous. Even God can't stop Alabama football
To Women: We don't give a fuck about your shoes. We care about your body. Go to the gym, not the mall. From: All straight men
My Pandora is ALL rap (mostly southern/Houston rap). Nickelback just came on. This is why computers will never rule the world
Just watched that Rebecca Black video...I really hope those children are not our future.
I love The First 48 so I knew Memphis was pretty bad, but damn--this place is a SHITHOLE. Good ribs though
My big Oscar night prediction: I'm not going to give a shit.
My friends 2yr old is like a bad drunk: rambles incoherently, overly affectionate w/dog, falls down, sleeps on floor & pees himself
In DC. Whoever called this city "Hollywood for ugly people" is brilliant.
According to my CHL class, deadly force can be used in TX for reasons ranging from "necessary to save ur life" to "that fella looked shady"
CHL instructor "When ur hunting an animal that can kill you, if it charges, don't run. You'll just die tired. Stand your ground & shoot it."
I should live tweet this class, instructor is awesome. Began class w/ "Go ahead and call 911, but you're just waiting to die."
In my Concealed Handgun License class at Cabelas. One day, ten hrs, complete certification. Another reason to like Texas.
Hide your dogs, he's talking about the Puppy Bowl @MikeVick That game just motivated me to work a lot harder this off season
Tough road to the Lombardi Trophy for GB--beat a dog murderer, a diabetic quitter and a rapist. Congrats Packers, you earned it
The Fergie hate is understandable though. No one likes ugly, bedwetting trannys.
How can people hate Will.i.am? Blah blah corporate music--he punched Perez Hilton in the mouth. He's a winner for life
Deadliest Catch fans: @captjohnathan paying more attention to the puppy bowl than the Super Bowl. Real tough crabber this one.
People always ask why I have 2 TVs in my living room. When they watch Super Bowl and Puppy Bowl at the same time, it all makes sense
@NilsAParker Wrong. L&O hierarchy is this: 1. Episodes with Briscoe, 2. Episodes w/o Briscoe. All other ranking are semantics
In Dutch Harbor after 24 hours on Time Boat in 60mph winds & 20ft waves. Puked 7 times. The Crew slept like it was nothing.
I shot bear mace into someones asshole, at a bar, for $200. Alaska is fucked up. There is no law here. This is beyond Thunderdome.
@greggdoyelcbs In ur defense: If I let loose on the #ifsantawasblack tag, I'm pretty sure Evan Williams himself would ban me from Twitter
@greggdoyelcbs [Sniff, sniff] Smell that Doyle? That's pussy. And it's coming from your Twitter. Don't be scurred.
@greggdoyelcbs Ur dick may be bigger, but so is your asshole. Proof: Curse on Twitter, Doyle. Say "Fuck Pete Thamel." Or will CBS get mad??
@greggdoyelcbs I don't wanna hurt you Doyle...I just wanna knock you out.
Tried Adderall, 1st time. Felt like fighting strangers. Looked up ingredients--it's just prescription meth! This helps people focus how??
Why no swingers? Lotsa reasons, but main one: 90% of male swingers I've met are like this dude: http://youtu.be/YVtEX1J7tXQ
Swinger couples-Im not into it. 2 dicks=bad. Husbands esp, stop asking me to gorilla fuck your wife as you watch; SUPER CREEPY
@benmezrich Close--I'd have a midget threesome ON the stolen bus. I don't fuck buses, they're usually underage.
Book tour finished last night in Austin. Drank 15 Deep Eddy Sweet Tea Vodkas @ wrap party. Just woke up, no hangover. That shit is amazing
Had a ton of people ask me what I think about Karen Owens and the "Duke Fuck List," so I posted my thoughts here: http://bit.ly/ciRqCk
In Tampa. Cant tell if every girl is dressed as Snookie for Halloween, or this place has the trashiest skanks in America.
@ForrestGriffin I know you in real life & put you in my movie & you STILL don't spell my name right. Thats kinda awesome.
Duke lawsuit isn't something cool like defamation, it's about 4k they say I owe for unpaid tuition. BS. If it gets funny, I'll update.
Just process served by sheriffs walking into Charlotte book signing. Who's suing me? Duke University. Not kidding. Details to follow.
About to do Fox 5 in SD. Will take all my self-control to not drop an Anchorman style "Fuck off, San Diego"
Creepiest AFF review,"Your new book is so good, I masturbated to it twice already." Thankfully written by a woman, http://amzn.to/9Eft2P
These two Milwaukee girls worked my dick so hard I think it's going to unionize and demand overtime.
Another fan on AFF: "Tucker your new book is like crack, except I don't get anything on my teeth." http://amzn.to/9Eft2P
Maybe I'm being harsh, but Snooki looks like she's made of farts and glitter.
Best AFF review so far: "If IHTSBIH was a level three sex offender, Assholes Finish First is the Catholic Church."
Just signed books for wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Wow. Not sure what to say. Life altering experience.
Wrote a post for @tferriss about book/blog marketing. Not that funny, but might be interesting to some: http://su.pr/2HIYQn
To people watching Jersey Shore & not NFL season opener: Ur the enemy of everything good in life, including sex and puppies.
The darkness has lifted. To quote John Madden, "FOOTBALL!" Saints/Vikings season opener = better than a double rainbow.
It's been a decade since 9/11. If u don't have ur shit together at airport security by now, maybe u should take the train.
When you're excited about watching a pre-season game involving the Bengals, u know u desperately missed football. Guilty.
Her: I'm funnier than u! Ima write a book about my life! Me: What'll it be called, Black Dicks & Speed Balls? Her: FUCK U!!!
Poor Tiger Woods. His whores took his dignity, his wife took 750mil, and LeBron took his "Biggest Fuckface in Sports" title.
Kobe only raped one girl. Cleveland is 500k people & LeBron raped all of them. Can't believe people still think Kobe's better.
A "Cleveland Steamer" is taking a dump on a persons chest. A "LeBron Steamer" is taking a dumb on an entire states soul.
When my kids ask what I was doing when LeBron James became the biggest dick on earth, I can proudly say, "Not giving a fuck."
@greggdoyelcbs Doyel, you're just like all the midgets I know. Trying so hard to keep up, but always a bit short.
@greggdoyelcbs You can't understand Houston rap until u hear it on 12's, sippin lean. It's awesome. Just ask @paulwallbaby. Yes, I'm white.
@greggdoyelcbs AHAHHAHA--u ARE old. I don't give a fuck about ur poor people ennui music. I'm all Houston rap. Candy paint and wood wheels.
@greggdoyelcbs HAHHAHHAHA--You and SuperDoucheLips are related!!! Have fun at your family reunion. Where is it this year, Brooklyn Zoo?
@greggdoyelcbs Only Chinese eat ox penis. He's a different race. UberGuido, I think. Hard to tell with subhumans like that.
@greggdoyelcbs I am LOATHE to stand up for u--but man u r right on this one. Hes such a douche, he looks like a parody of a douche.
Bartender: you're dating her? Me: no just fucking her. Her: excuse me! Were fucking AFFECTIONATELY!
Just landed in Vegas. Half the airport is strippers and escorts. Must be a baptist church convention this weekend.
Watching the race from jimmy Johnsons pit. Gotta be honest, NASCAR is fucking awesome  http://twitpic.com/1q7r6c
In Charlotte, going to my first NASCAR race. People keep asking my fav driver-can't I just root for crashes like the rednecks?
Tiger Woods admitted to cheating with 121 women. 121 in 5 YEARS? Amateur. If you need lessons Tiger, I'll he happy to help.
Justin Massler--guy who stalks me and Ivanka Trump--just emailed me asking me not to cockblock him w/her. Laugh, cry, or call police?
2 biggest NCAA tourney stars: Omar Samhan & Ali Farokhmanesh. Al Qaeda has stopped killing Americans, is now cool with embarrassing us.
Did you ever think you'd see the day where the phrase "Iranian dropping bombs on Kansas" was a good thing?
A Persian assassin killed Alexander the Great, a Persian girl killed Steve McNair, and now a Persian killed my NCAA bracket.
I am in awe of the courage and skill of an Iranian...basketball player. What's next? A male Asian porn star?
As reward for single-handledly beating Kansas and having balls of steel, every girl in Iowa should fuck Ali Farokhmanesh. Seriously.
Ali Farokhmanesh is the best Iranian since Mithridates. Every girl in Iowa should blow him, lord knows he has the balls to accommodate them
Anytime someone calls and identifies themselves with their full name, it is not someone you want to talk to.
@greggdoyelcbs You just pimped your account to people who ALREADY follow you. You are a failure at the Twitter.
@greggdoyelcbs Your jokes are as bad at your hair. Im the greatest midget fucker ever. I went ass to mouth on a midget. I win. At life.
Real exchange @DrewCurtis "Do you know what rumble strips are?" @laurenleto "Yes, that's how my friend died."
Did you know that in Texas, you can buy a gun when you're piss drunk? I know what I'm doing this weekend.
If God invented anything better than drunk sex with a hot girl, he kept it to himself.
Onion piece about assholes, calls me their leader. Awesome! Only thing better is a South Park parody: http://onion.com/aOgLTo
Irish are super nice, but I see why they drink so much: Ireland is depressing. Everythings wet, dark and cold. Even the pussy.
I love that some people thought I was serious. What do I know about mick politics? I'm gonna get drunk on Guinness and find me pot o'gold.
On plane to Dublin, Ireland. Going to UCD to give the speech, "Why the English have a moral right to Northern Ireland."
It is awesomely appropriate that my iPhone autocorrects "DTF" to "STD"
1000+ phone calls and so many texts  iPhone crashed twice. Maybe my phone number in the movie wasn't as brilliant as I thought
@greggdoyelcbs I'd never date you. You aren't emotionally broken enough. If your uncle didn't touch you when you were 8, I'm not into u
I don't care that it makes me a bad person, I watched this 80x. And laughed again each time: http://imgur.com/zIQIt
Just took my range rover for service. The mechanic is a really hot woman. Thought that only happened in porn.
@greggdoyelcbs Understandable. You know how vigilant Catholics are about keeping creepy old men away from children.
@greggdoyelcbs Are you telling me Charlie Weiss had leftovers? Call the Vatican, it's another Touchdown Jesus Miracle!
@greggdoyelcbs That's an urban legend. Everyone knows midget are mythical creatures. Like unicorns and guidos.
Chris Brown got so mad at Wal-Mart he deleted his Twitter? WTF? That's like getting pissed at Rihanna and hitting Beyonce.
People keep asking me who my favorite girl from Jersey Shore is. Not sure--are any of them dead? I like that one the best.
Watching "Jersey Shore"--now I understand why the terrorists hate America.
First the SEC title, now the Heisman. Clearly, God prefers Mark Ingram over his own son, Tim Tebow.
Tiger missed a great chance to redeem his image. Shoulda said, "I've decided to take an indefinite break from banging sluts."
Tiger Woods is NOT the Tiger Woods of cheating on his wife--he sucks at it. More like the Jake Delhomme of cheating on his wife.
I have to disagree with John Calipari. It looks to me like John Wall actually does shit ice cream.
Me: you're a squirter. Awesome I want to see. Her: you have to make me cum before I squirt. Me: barking up the wrong tree honey.
Girl asks,"How can I fuck Tucker Max?" 1.Be a hot girl 2.Make it easy on me. The better u r at 2, the more flexible I am with 1
So that girl stole that bag of wine line from @TFLN. Props for good comedic taste, but I'm still gonna put it in her ass for the theft.
Her: "I'm an alcoholic." Me: "How'd you realize it?" Her: "I woke up with a bag of wine as my pillow." I can't top that.

Ill be honest: I said wouldn't let Irvin use my room bc I'm a redskins fan. That's false. It was bc I was afraid he'd steal something.
