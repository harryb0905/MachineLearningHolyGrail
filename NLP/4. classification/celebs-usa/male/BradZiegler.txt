@JoshNorris @CrazyFanTakes Well if he wouldn‚Äôt have played so long, he couldn‚Äôt have kept putting up 1000-yard seasons üòÇ
@Northernop @darrenrovell @Realrclark25 Actually, they didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why they released him. Not solely bc of what he had done. Because he lied to them the whole time about what had happened.   And this isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúPatriots‚Äù thing. Would feel the same way if it was Clark Hunt or Jerry Jones or any other owner.
@CJB1217 @darrenrovell @Realrclark25 Absolutely. But this isn‚Äôt someone making a claim. He‚Äôs been arrested, which means there‚Äôs enough evidence (including video surveillance) to warrant charges being brought. Apples and oranges.
@srob2247 @darrenrovell @Realrclark25 ‚ÄúLet alone this...‚Äù   Exactly what do you think would be so much worse than being involved in sex trafficking? And tell me something worse an owner has done (assuming the charges stick).
@jclynch101 @darrenrovell @Realrclark25 And I‚Äôll let it play out. But you‚Äôre usually not arrested unless there‚Äôs a solid amount of evidence. Especially when it‚Äôs on video.
@JonEinalhori @darrenrovell @Realrclark25 Owners are held to a higher standard. Right or wrong, they are. And this is a huge black mark for the league.
@JonEinalhori @darrenrovell @Realrclark25 As a player? Doesn‚Äôt matter. There will still be 46 guys out there trying to win every week. One of the first things talked about each year in team meetings is being accountable to each other. Usually that speech is given by the owner or other front office person.
@ScottJenstad @Chris_Liss https://t.co/jcAyMHrmH9
@darrenrovell You probably can‚Äôt realistically fine him enough $ to make it felt. I like @Realrclark25‚Äôs idea: take away their whole draft. Make him responsible to the organization like the players are when they‚Äôre suspended for doing something stupid.

@tanner_kemna @Omarsette @PoochieD33 @AKDumbuya @_TylerWagner_ @vlaekershner @EmilyCWaldon The minor league clubs make all their own $ but don‚Äôt pay the players. The club pays the MLB team to use them as a farm club. Then the club makes all the money at the stadium.
@darrenrovell @PPF_CPA @SportsTaxMan For now, this is enough. We butt heads enough that I‚Äôm sure another opportunity will present itself. :)
@tanner_kemna @Omarsette @PoochieD33 @AKDumbuya @_TylerWagner_ @vlaekershner @EmilyCWaldon 90% of minor league players don‚Äôt make it to the major leagues. What value do they bring? Yes, they should be paid fairly. But explain the value they bring...
@darrenrovell @PPF_CPA @SportsTaxMan $20M bonus and no deferred $... so, back to those tax discussions and our bet...
@The_SportsPaige Looks can be deceiving
@Omarsette @PoochieD33 @AKDumbuya @_TylerWagner_ @vlaekershner @EmilyCWaldon This is a pick-and-choose statement. While I wish minor leaguers were paid fairly (the aren‚Äôt), the vast majority of them don‚Äôt bring any revenue for the clubs.

@ForbesSports @BlowoutBuzz @ryenarussillo
@vlaekershner @EmilyCWaldon @_TylerWagner_ Depends on what you mean by ‚Äúanything‚Äù... they definitely have done some things to improve minor league life. But the minor leaguers aren‚Äôt members of the union, so the priority is definitely 40-man roster players.

@mightyblanket @Yojimbo615 @JonnyD80 @elt2jv_ssbn739 @watkinson7 I knew. I missed the tweet jimbo sent about credits and then you made an assumption of a credit in your tweet. Apologies for the oversight.
@KUTheShiver And our chances....?
@mightyblanket @Yojimbo615 @JonnyD80 @elt2jv_ssbn739 @watkinson7 I know what a flat tax is. You used multiple rates for your example.
@mightyblanket @Yojimbo615 @JonnyD80 @elt2jv_ssbn739 @watkinson7 You're ignoring that $1,700 means much more to someone making $17,000 than $150,000 is to someone making $1,000,000. Flat tax would only further income inequality.  Just to clarify, what percentage are you using for your example here?
@mightyblanket @Yojimbo615 @JonnyD80 @elt2jv_ssbn739 @watkinson7 See, talking percentages is different than a flat amount. Your first tweet discussed a flat amount.
@mightyblanket @Yojimbo615 @JonnyD80 @elt2jv_ssbn739 @watkinson7 @JonHeyman ‚¨ÜÔ∏è doesnt understand flat tax
@darrenrovell @PPF_CPA @SportsTaxMan What‚Äôre the terms?
@PPF_CPA @darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan No way the bonus is more than 25% of the total deal.
@PPF_CPA @darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan But signing bonus will be a small portion of the contract relatively. I was referencing daily salary.
@elt2jv_ssbn739 @watkinson7 @JonHeyman Yep. Detroit, Kansas City, Philly (maybe more?)
@darrenrovell @dahncurtis @iRTlikecrazy @SportsTaxMan Not like it‚Äôll be half or anything. Maybe $50M-$60M or so total?
@dahncurtis @iRTlikecrazy @darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan It‚Äôs fine. Only did it 11 years, including several years for a Cali team.
@dahncurtis @iRTlikecrazy @darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan Wait till the contract details will come out. Maybe $50M total bonus/deferred? So $250M salary over 10 years.
@btrageser @darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan No, you get a credit for taxes paid in other states. He will pay 13.3% tax on his daily salary for days spent in Cali (games and off days) during the season.
@dahncurtis @iRTlikecrazy @darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan It‚Äôs not like more than half of the $ will be SB or deferred. And I wasn‚Äôt referencing that stuff at all. A huge portion of the $ of this contract will have taxes paid in Cali.
@watkinson7 @JonHeyman Yup. Except Texas and Florida - you pay taxes for those states in your state of residency (if your state of residency has state income tax).
@karlravechespn That‚Äôs always attempted. Note: when you hear comments from Tony, they‚Äôre usually in response to Manfred. The PA doesn‚Äôt typically volunteer info on CBA negotiations.
@JonHeyman Only taxes for the days of his his home games (and other games played in Cali) are paid in California.
@darrenrovell @SportsTaxMan Doesn‚Äôt matter. Games played in Cali pay taxes in Cali.

@DHern_30 @generalmills101 @DynastyTradesHQ @DynastyNerds @FFDynastyTrades @SuperFlexShow @DynastyTrades @SuperFlexTrades The fact that there‚Äôs a question/debate sucks. Maybe Jacobs? Anderson? Henderson? Montgomery?
@qopbaseball When we played at Pittsburgh, they tracked vertical movement (differently, apparently) and it would always show -14 inches or so of vertical movement... I think they measured it off the plane the ball started on.
@qopbaseball Wondering if my vertical break was skewed in the results, bc I actually threw the ball upward when I pitched, as opposed to an overhand pitcher whose ball trajectory started downward...the ball would end up almost at the same height as I released it, but a hump in the trajectory.

@RotowireNFL_JD @RotoWire I‚Äôm for 2nd chances when someone shows remorse, apologizes, and changes their behavior. But they have to earn that opportunity.
@RotowireNFL_JD @RotoWire You quoted a tweet to start the thread talking about all words contrary to winning football games being meaningless. Of all the people tweeting about this, that‚Äôs the one you chose to quote. So yeah, that‚Äôs what it seems like your feelings were.
@RotowireNFL_JD @ByJoeDavis @RotoWire Man. No 2nd chances for anyone from Jerry. Must be nice having never messed up in life.
@RotowireNFL_JD @RotoWire Then look at Hunt in 2017. He was a monster with Alex Smith. It took Hunt awhile to get going in the new offense last year. Compare their rookies seasons.
@RotowireNFL_JD @RotoWire On the field: Hunt &gt; Chubb  Not close.
@RotoWire I think it‚Äôs pretty misguided to tell someone they made the wrong decision when they have a chance to do something they love and make a great living doing it.
@RotoWire To all those saying ‚Äúno‚Äù... what if he really doesn‚Äôt like baseball that much but has a strong passion for football? I played with lots of guys who didn‚Äôt really like baseball. They were naturally good at it, but they never got better bc they had no drive - they didn‚Äôt love it.

@matt73027 @allinkid I‚Äôm not putting them on the same pedestal. That was the point of the original message. They‚Äôre a bad program‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why it happens.
@karsgma KU has won 14 straight conference titles. Many huge wins along the way. 0 court rushes. Same with Duke, Kentucky, Michigan State, North Carolina, etc.‚Ä¶ Good programs don‚Äôt do it. Every win is treated the same.
@matt73027 @allinkid Nothing of the sort. No fans from good schools ever rush the court. Duke? UNC? Kentucky? KU? Michigan St? Never happens
And the final straw that shows KSU is a bad program: crowd rushing the court.

@CynicalPatsFan @OcnNash @ChandlerBats1 @AdamSchefter He didn‚Äôt start 3 games in 2016 that he played. But he played over 80% of the offensive snaps in each game. Should we just not count those games then since he didn‚Äôt play the first snap?
@CynicalPatsFan @OcnNash @ChandlerBats1 @AdamSchefter Not to mention 0 pro bowls
@CynicalPatsFan @OcnNash @ChandlerBats1 @AdamSchefter Who cares about starts? Just bc he didn‚Äôt play the first play of the game doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt play most of it.   Also... Edelman postseason stats: 18 G, 115 rec, 1412 yds, 5 TDs  averages: 6.3 rec, 78.4 yds, 0.27 TD  Why is this considered amazing?
@CynicalPatsFan @OcnNash @ChandlerBats1 @AdamSchefter Lol what stats are YOU looking at? Bowe has 10 more career games.
@CynicalPatsFan @JamesABigos @AdamSchefter And it‚Äôs *your
@CynicalPatsFan @JamesABigos @AdamSchefter Fair. It made Edelman‚Äôs numbers better than they actually are. They‚Äôre even worse than that. Not even 500 catches yet. Yards and TDs are accurate tho.
@Steelerzfan73 @RFParga82 @WhitlockJason Colby Rasmus holds almost every postseason hitting record that‚Äôs not a counting stat.
@WhitlockJason He‚Äôs not even on the same planet as Hines Ward, and he isn‚Äôt even sniffing the Hall.
@ExeterSportsGuy Zero. Chance.
@ldawg31174 @ClutchFantasy Hones Ward has 2 rings, 1 SB MVP, and double the regular season production. Not HOF.
@ClutchFantasy @ScottFish24 I was being sarcastic.
@ldawg31174 @ClutchFantasy He‚Äôs not in the top 50 WR in yds/game in playoff history.
@ClutchFantasy @ScottFish24 Nick. Foles.
@KleinschmidtJD His last name is probably Nelson. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@StevenxxSnyder @FFBlitz @FFDynastyTrades @DynastyOuthouse Anyone voting yes, please look up Hines Ward career stats. Double the regular season numbers, good postseason numbers, SB MVP, 4 Pro Bowls (Edelman has 0)...and HW‚Äôs not even close to HOF.
@ExeterSportsGuy When was the last time someone got in the HOF having never made a Pro Bowl?   Dude is clutch for sure. Not a HOFer. It‚Äôs not close. Hines Ward has double the regular season production, good postseason stats, 2 rings and a SB MVP and not even getting close in HOF voting.
@JamesABigos @AdamSchefter Edelman not even in top 50 in postseason career yards per game for WR. Has 3 rings, 1 SB MVP.  Hines Ward has 2 rings, 1 SB MVP, and double the stats of Edelman in regular season and not even getting past ‚Äúsemifinal‚Äù in HOF voting last 2 years.
@JoeyGloster @JoshDeFamio @Smitty1569 @AdamSchefter And I love Edelman. Good dude. Just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a HOFer. https://t.co/pJodLlsdoZ

@Smitty1569 @AdamSchefter You‚Äôre joking, right. On a per-game basis, Edelman isn‚Äôt in the top 50 in receiving yards. He‚Äôs just been there a lot.
@ChandlerBats1 @AdamSchefter He‚Äôs a good player. He‚Äôs not HOF.
@ExeterSportsGuy @AdamSchefter Zero chance. You‚Äôd put Colby Rasmus in the MLB HOF, wouldn‚Äôt you?
@Smitty1569 @AdamSchefter 3? I mean, he‚Äôs a good player. But there are guys on his own team with more than him.
@ChandlerBats1 @AdamSchefter You‚Äôd put Colby Rasmus in the baseball HOF? .423/.571/1.038 career slash line in the playoffs.

@Coronado9978 @FFBlitz @FantasyBrosFF @MyFantasyLeague @DoOrDynasty Why the urgency to get another pick then? Draft at 1.01 and wait till you see how valuable those 2 picks are next year.
@Coronado9978 @FFBlitz @FantasyBrosFF @MyFantasyLeague @DoOrDynasty Guessing right now, they‚Äôre not specifically valuing who would be at 1.05 slot, bc the outcome would‚Äôve been different. In fact, it‚Äôs possible the 2020 2nd could be = 1.05 this year depending on how high it is. WR are too easy to find. And 2019 only has WR. Good RBs gone by 1.05.
@Coronado9978 @FFBlitz @FantasyBrosFF @MyFantasyLeague @DoOrDynasty Whoops.
@azjimbo08 He worked for Adidas. NCAA has no authority.
@lincoln_jake @rotounderworld I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt - this Chiefs regime just doesn‚Äôt believe in spending a lot of $ at the RB position. They‚Äôll draft a guy in the 5th round or sign an overlooked veteran cheap (see: Damien Williams).

And today, if a kid in PR or Latin America is 20 and still unsigned, he‚Äôs essentially no longer a prospect. While I love this and every other story about Mo, scouts nowadays give up on so many kids who are late-bloomers. https://t.co/9ql3w7nAcC

@ByJoeDavis @ryenarussillo Doesn‚Äôt matter. What if you play them next year in the playoffs and they haven‚Äôt realized it and you still have their tell?

@CrashGladys @JeffAllen71 He found the guy! He sent an updated tweet later :)
@MikeTagliereNFL He had the least number of INTs of any QB with 32 or more TDs whose colors are black and gold and played their home games in a dome.
@toddmiller33 Either him or someone on the defense. Doesn‚Äôt matter. W.
How about a game where Mahomes doesn‚Äôt throw for a single TD and we put up 31.

@mikemorse34 @RapSheet Hey, you‚Äôre the one that said the AFC West was better than the NFC North.
@mikemorse34 @RapSheet Chiefs and Raiders have 2 of the worst defenses in football.
@mikemorse34 @RapSheet I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre being sarcastic
@bendoll1 @RapSheet So, wouldn‚Äôt you blame the guy who brought him in more than the guy who was forced to use him?
@RapSheet Keenum was viable in Minnesota. Why not in Denver?
Lev Bell to Jags? https://t.co/BJyo6vI2dZ
@ScottFish24 @frankcampagnola @RyanMc23 It only happens when there‚Äôs been a clock stoppage only if the stoppage is a result of a bad call. If the correct call has the ball in play with clock running, that‚Äôs the only time there‚Äôs a runoff.
@ScottFish24 @RyanMc23 Average is 15.7 seconds. 12 is hurried. So 10 is generous.
@smcmac321 @lanceallan #basedonrecords
@ScottFish24 @RyanMc23 But they do the 10-second runoff from the time he caught the ball - not from the time they decided to challenge it. They actually put time back on the clock before they did the runoff.
@ScottJenstad Thanks for him
Wow - what a way to get 5000 and 50!
@ByJoeDavis You mean *block?
Man, Chiefs D out of NOWHERE
@WatchTheBreaks @RMcardsfan Try 40. Cards from 1998 are not vintage.
@RMcardsfan @cpptrading Personally, I don‚Äôt like grading modern cards at all unless it‚Äôs a rookie card (Bowman Draft/Chrome stuff). If I offer on modern cards (like the ones you have) that are graded, the grades don‚Äôt affect my offer at all; and if I get it, I bust it out of the graded case.
@JeffRatcliffe @Andy_Williams16 I would agree that injuries aren‚Äôt busts. I disagree that you have to play to fail. And if we are using definitions, Merriam-Webster agrees with me. https://t.co/9I2sSFP70s
@JeffRatcliffe I just feel like if you were taken in every fantasy draft, you qualify. I don‚Äôt care if you played or not...how much return did I get on my investment? And if it‚Äôs 0 return for 1.2, that‚Äôs a bust to me.
Sources tell me that Keith Butler is a HUGE fan of Stephen A. Smith... https://t.co/SQ7Vbv7ia9
@JeffRatcliffe Guess we have different definitions of ‚Äúbust‚Äù...because I feel like it‚Äôs a colossal failure to abandon your team by using loopholes for completely selfish reasons.
@JeffRatcliffe Don‚Äôt disagree that Pryor was a 2017 bust. But IMO, Bell was in 2018, too. A bust is any player who has high expectations going into the season and ends up worthless. That was Bell. All year. See 2a. There were expectations for Bell all the way through week 10. Zero return. https://t.co/CKpgeZ6jPZ
@JeffRatcliffe But, under your criteria, I‚Äôm going Chris Hogan.
@JeffRatcliffe Doesn‚Äôt matter that he didn‚Äôt play. It was a choice, and to get 0 pts from a top 2 pick takes every team that had him basically out of playoff contention.
@JeffRatcliffe Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell. Bell.
@RyanMc23 IMO, you should primarily look at weeks 1-13. Playoffs are a coin toss once you get in, but getting in is obviously vital. I‚Äôve seen 6-seeds win 2 league championships this year. Just had to get in to have a chance.

@SwampAss_Mitch @FieldYates They didn‚Äôt.
@ryenarussillo It just shows how good he has the offense going, because every loss was within one possession...and in their wins, they only gave up less than 20 three times and more than 30 twice.
@jhawk913 @ByJoeDavis @Stephoncamp21 But IF they call PI, the tip should‚Äôve been in play.
@jhawk913 @ByJoeDavis @Stephoncamp21 That‚Äôs not PI. That‚Äôs holding. Not a spot foul. It‚Äôs inept for the official to be reaching for a flag before the ball is thrown and call PI.
@ShelbyMiller19 I have yet to see a big league shortstop that I‚Äôm better than. But I guarantee Mahomes couldn‚Äôt be any worse trying to defend these WRs than the other Chiefs DBs.
I would‚Äôve taken Kendall Fuller with 1 arm immobilized in a cast.
@bflbilsfan1 https://t.co/goEMgHYltg
Any chance Mahomes can play CB?
That throw was more impressive to me than the West TD throw.
This guy. Are you serious?
Man, that sucks. Baldwin just fell down. Refs have no awareness.
IF the Chiefs win this game...IF...I feel like it‚Äôll be on a 2-pt conversion.
That throw...
@JaredSarlo @FieldYates https://t.co/lukcKDbzpq
Lol HILARIOUS to see the Steelers players celebrating a 1st down on the fake punt when they came up short!
@bglkillz18 @FieldYates With less than 10 wins.
@ImWakaaa @FieldYates Nah, I‚Äôm good - thanks, tho.
@Chuckbraud But you can live with it when your HOF QB throws them. Not when your rookie who was drafted for his legs does it - esp when he throws into double coverage.
@ByJoeDavis He got fired bc he wouldn‚Äôt work with their 1st overall pick. Tried to embarrass Baker all the time in front of the team, etc. Baker obviously took it very personally.
@ByJoeDavis There‚Äôs much more to that. Hue and Baker were at odds when he got fired.
@CaptureCinema1 @OldTakesExposed Gotta make sure those new followers see it.
Man, how do the Saints ever let Taysom Hill throw the ball? You have Drew Brees. Stop being cute.
@FieldYates You forgot this one...  0: BUF
@The_Oddsmaker ‚úÖ
@darrenrovell Not saying I agree with it. But we shouldn‚Äôt have double standards. James should be held just as accountable.
@darrenrovell Ask Sean Newcomb. He got crushed for it. And it was several years old with almost no following at the time.

@MLB Yes.
I literally would‚Äôve been better off starting McCaffrey at QB than Brees tonight.
To all the people claiming it was a shoulder hit, look again. Plus, when Thomas goes to the ground, he qualifies as a ‚Äúdefenseless receiver.‚Äù This was a blatant penalty. https://t.co/WWBzupimPV
@Andy_Williams16 The receiver going to the ground qualifies him as ‚Äúdefenseless‚Äù...and it doesn‚Äôt matter what Reid tried to do. He hit him with his helmet. Rulebook is black and white.
I feel like the Saints need to go to a no-huddle to get some offensive rhythm. Something to get the defense on their heels. There‚Äôs nothing beyond 10 yards right now.
@allinkid He‚Äôll find out when he loses a chunk of his game check.
Basically the definition of launching yourself into a helmet-to-helmet hit and no penalty. https://t.co/dWtivdhYub
@FansOfKU @T_2releFOUR Without 2 of their 3 best big men
That is one of the dumbest replay rules. He‚Äôs down a hair shy of the 9 and in bounds, but let‚Äôs go ahead and keep it at the 10 and keep the clock stopped. I know that‚Äôs the rules. They‚Äôre stupid.
@JimmyBozz If the Chiefs win in weeks 16 and 17, losing in week 15 means nothing. If the Chiefs won, the division was over. If they win in weeks 16 and 17, the division is over. Same result.
@FantasyPros @SmolaDS @mrhill9169 @WazNFL @Pat_Thorman @NMariano53 @FF_Wheeler @andyholloway @PFF_NateJahnke @The_Oddsmaker @4for4_John Nice @andyholloway
@bigaldogg1 It‚Äôs basically 1 game. If they win at Seattle.
@Flame_Spitter55 Not if the Chiefs win their last 2 games. Means zero.
@JimmyBozz Read the first line.
What‚Äôs kinda funny is that if the Chiefs win out, tonight‚Äôs game ends up meaning absolutely nothing in the playoff race. Chiefs would still get home field, Chargers would still get 5 seed. It only had significance if the Chiefs won.
@matt_stites I think the officials aren‚Äôt competent enough to look for 2 things at the same time on one play. They‚Äôre overmatched with the speed of today‚Äôs game. There needs to be 3-4 more officials on the field to narrow their field of focus.
The officials sucked all game, which isn‚Äôt surprising. The biggest call was the PI in the end zone on Fuller. It was questionable at best, but what wasn‚Äôt questionable is that the pass was uncatchable. Williams came down out of bounds, so a completion wasn‚Äôt possible. Garbage.
@KennyAndCrash @foxsports910 Hahaha - tell Jeff I said his dynasty team is sorry

@hallshane7 @BleacherReport @DudePerfect Lol you definitely have referee eyes then lol - they usually have to see replays to get it right too!
@hallshane7 @BleacherReport @DudePerfect He hopped backwards off his right foot and landed with both feet. Same as jumping and landing with the ball.   The ‚Äútwo steps‚Äù thing is after a dribble. From the time the ball last hit the floor, his feet hit 3 times (right, left, right)
@BleacherReport @DudePerfect He‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs still a travel.
@darrenrovell If, by ‚Äúintriguing,‚Äù you mean ‚Äústupidest,‚Äù then I agree. This is idiotic.
I can‚Äôt wait to read the CBS and Yahoo fantasy game reviews berating the owners in my leagues for leaving Henry on their bench.
@Brickwallblitz @RMSummerlin @RovellReplies
It‚Äôs so awesome to see the Jags celebrating tackles when they‚Äôre down 30-9.
@allinkid Better yet, don‚Äôt state opinions.
More impressive is the work of the person sliding the papers... #stickyfingers https://t.co/3EGurGpWbv
@cali4life13 Nope. Rule states any part of the QB‚Äôs body.
@ModestoBeek I know the play you‚Äôre talking about. His forearm was clearly down while the ball was behind the line. He kept falling forward (over the line) after that, but he was down when his forearm hit. And yes, they absolutely can and do use the ‚Äúline feed‚Äù for replay reviews.
I thought if you got the same foot down twice it counted as 2 feet down?
Chiefs look sloppy. Good thing they‚Äôre playing the Raiders.
@ModestoBeek All the time. They use the yellow line for first down reviews, too. Same principle.
How is that not a defenseless receiver???
@JoshDoucet1 If 1 thread of fabric or 1 flake of skin is on the line, he‚Äôs considered behind it. Half his body was on or behind it.
@ModestoBeek But they can use it for replay reviews.
If any part of the QB‚Äôs body‚Äôs at or behind the line of scrimmage when he releases the ball, it‚Äôs a legal forward pass. So...? ü§î https://t.co/hhAlnreLSX

@JoshDoucet1 @ryenarussillo Teams can‚Äôt spy him when they‚Äôre running the ball with RBs (Edwards) as well as they are. And even if they do, if he‚Äôs 1-on-1 in the open, I‚Äôll take him against ANY LB in football.
@CrackinWax @PatNeshek @PJHughes45 @glenperkins Sportsflix and Topps Gallery
@andrewperloff It‚Äôs a mistake to have him throw the ball 56 times.
@JoshDoucet1 @ryenarussillo I‚Äôm not saying Jackson is as good as Brees. I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs a QB and he‚Äôs a better runner than any other QB in the league. And both of his picks today were tipped, so not entirely his fault. But he‚Äôs 2-0 and getting better. No way they go back to Flacco.
@JoshDoucet1 @ryenarussillo Oh, you mean the guy who passed for more yards than Drew Brees this week doesn‚Äôt count as a QB?

@AskeBay Thanks - you might want to check their other listings. It appears there are several in the same boat, if not all of them...
@BrodieNBCS Yeah, I agree - like the NFL - but I wouldn‚Äôt have overturned that one
@CBake93 https://t.co/igbAPWJHFr
@pasmith16 @eBay @AskeBay Not always - I‚Äôve gotten a ton that passed authentication when trying to build a set. Just gotta find the right sellers.
See this? @eBay @AskeBay https://t.co/majIdwAj6n
@BrodieNBCS In slow motion, yeah... that‚Äôs tough to call at full speed tho
@CBake93 Maybe if it was serial-numbered 1/1
@CBake93 Just a minimum bid. They‚Äôre probably hoping it climbs to like $3.
And by the way, tweeps - I have no problem if you all want to bombard this seller with messages outing them for forgery. Feel free to report the fraudulent listing, too.
Hey ‚Å¶@eBay‚Å© - that‚Äôs not my autograph - it‚Äôs not even close. Please remove the listing, suspend the seller, and tell them to do a better job of forging it next time.   https://t.co/AnCQrNLu8g ‚Å¶‚Å© ‚Å¶@AskeBay‚Å©
@FFHitman *Mullens ...fixed your typo and GIF https://t.co/5HgDOXJTSB
@The_SportsPaige Well yeah, he was just named on the inactives list for week 1 of 2019
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt have the 49ers DST being the best streaming play this week. But this Raiders O-line is horrendous. They may give up 10 sacks tonight.
@cassius_stanley @KUTheShiver Call the coaches first and inform them out of respect - they‚Äôve invested a lot of time into you.
@FG_Dolan Except that Tate is a free agent after the year.
@FantasyPros Based on the game flow at that time, I think it would‚Äôve benefited Cordarrelle Patterson owners the most. All 7 of them.
@TheFFBallers &lt; 11 in .5 PPR The other guy has him!
Happy for my guys in Boston. Lots of great guys in that locker room, and they were the best team in the game all season long. Happy for the city and fans, too... This may have been the best @RedSox team ever, and that‚Äôs saying something. #WSChampions #DoDamage
@Stikkity @zgoulden14 Yep. This was discussed in the original conversation. Cleveland. Same as week 1.
Ahh, yes... remembering back fondly to the night the NFL started babying Star QBs... #Elway #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/dS81suEW5D
@IreneHaley16 Jansen
@CaseyStern He only wants Price to have to get 1 out. And Kimbrel only 4.
@Billando That‚Äôs the difference. He‚Äôs got 5 guys in his pen in Oct who have pitched all year who don‚Äôt pitch unless it‚Äôs extra innings.
@myinfo11462 No. Way more days off built in in October. It‚Äôs already essentially expanded bc you don‚Äôt use 5 SP, so it gives you an extra spot or 2 elsewhere on the team.
@Billando But does he give others days off in crunch time and put it all on you?
I will never understand why managers ask guys to do so much more in October than they‚Äôve done all year. Once or twice? Ok, but night after night all month? Hard pass. Trust the other guys who also got you there.
@barstoolsports @mojobreak_com Not true, but ok lol. #TedLilly
@slaugin @PeteAbe No, Puig hits RHP better
@PeteAbe When the analytics come back to bite you...
@PhiotaTravieso Not if I had a competent alternative. There are too many other great players out there to spend high $ on that will give you effort.
@AskeBay you used to, but the latest app update took it away - it should show the items grouped by seller
@AskeBay you need to show the seller name for items in your cart that are ‚Äúsaved for later‚Äù so that it‚Äôs easier to see which are from the same seller to get combined shipping
@CaseyStern @MLBNetworkRadio Definitely a quad
@S_____C_____ You‚Äôre just wrong on this. Every player will tell you that was a completely legal, legit slide.
@nscrgrl24 @YouTube That‚Äôs what bedtime is for
@KyleWright911 @YouTube Yep
@Jeff_Erickson Neither has Matt Holliday, but he was called safe #2007
@S_____C_____ Not dirty in the least. Red Sox will tell you the same.
Hey @YouTube - can you please explain to me why I‚Äôm getting push notifications multiple times a day for ‚Äúrecommended videos‚Äù when my notifications are turned off? https://t.co/ULRsgTCrcd
@S_____C_____ There‚Äôs nothing wrong with breaking up a DP - you go for contact if he‚Äôs in your path to the bag
@S_____C_____ That‚Äôs a biased comment. When you‚Äôre sprinting and sliding, that movement is involuntary. Bogey needs to get out of the baseline.
@Clevela2S Nothing wrong with trying to break up the double play - he went straight into the bag and hit the ground before he hit the fielder...and Bogey was in the baseline. Part of the game but perfectly clean play.
Good slide.
@CraigMish Someone had to drive it back to the pen
@CraigMish üôÑ
@GintyFresh36 With 2 outs, you take the gamble to get into scoring position. Not even a question.
J.B.J.
That was absolutely sorry. Seriously, who thinks that celebrating out of the box is more important than giving a little effort for your team in the freaking World Series? Especially when it honestly wasn‚Äôt even that close to being a homer.
@CaseyStern *standard*
@Marleens12 Howard initiated the contact. All is fair game after that point.
That was one of the best catches ever and one of the worst offensive interference calls I‚Äôve ever seen. Howard was also draped on him. What a shame that catch doesn‚Äôt count.
Rock. Chalk.
@rotowiremario @RotoWire We will see
@rotowiremario @RotoWire You mean besides the fact that he isn‚Äôt very good at football?

Wow, what a kick by Catanzaro
@gmansfield_fish @Vikings That was the opposite of conservative
@jasonuk17 @RotoWire Oh, you mean all those times Bortles threw it away in his general vicinity? I wouldn‚Äôt call that actually ‚Äúusing him‚Äù
I wonder when NFL coaches will learn to quit playing so conservatively when they get a decent lead.
@jasonuk17 @RotoWire He hasn‚Äôt gotten much practice because they haven‚Äôt thrown to him for 5 weeks.
I know Bortles hasn‚Äôt been good, but the Jags don‚Äôt use Keelan Cole enough.
@FG_Dolan Only when passing. He‚Äôs an elusive runner. üòÇ
@RapSheet @NFLGameDay 15 strikes and you‚Äôre out

@ScottJenstad Not watching, but sounds like something Andy Reid would do.
@jaysonst That doesn‚Äôt hurt. But didn‚Äôt you see? https://t.co/8NL9P2vM6K
@jaysonst But it‚Äôs the fan in RF last night, Jayson. He‚Äôs the reason the Astros are losing. Oh, and Joe West. His fault, too.
@Mike_M_Morgan Did you not see the playcalling tweet a few min earlier? It‚Äôs incredibly predictable and not utilizing Johnson‚Äôs best asset AT ALL. And they don‚Äôt use him in the passing game at all, and that should be criminal.
Prediction (yes, I realize I‚Äôm going WAY out on a limb here): David Johnson owners will be very happy starting in week 8. McCoy will be gone tomorrow if not by postgame presser tonight. No way they were going to fire him on a short week with little time to install new concepts.
Well, the @Broncos finally found a good QB. He‚Äôs just been playing WR for the last 9 years.
@shawnfielding12 @DFF_Dynasty Either one. Just not Cooper.
How is the playcalling seriously this predictable? This wouldn‚Äôt even work on Madden rookie level. https://t.co/QXgmJyNL2o
@JamesABigos You missed the hashtag https://t.co/N7Yv9i0sm5
@FFDynastyPolls @DynastyTradesHQ @DynastyTradeFF @DynastyTrades I wouldn‚Äôt give 1 2nd for him

Let‚Äôs gooooooo! #ChiefsKingdom
@FG_Dolan Yep - both calls were soft
@JMaloneStrength @PaulPabst Was just watching on Red Zone and he was non-existent in a game they were trailing the whole time. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
@andyholloway You‚Äôre welcome.
@D_STROYAN #23 vs the run before today‚Äôs game...that‚Äôs not stellar
@D_STROYAN Based on what the Browns have allowed on the ground so far this year, it‚Äôs what ANY NFL RB can do. That‚Äôs my point. He‚Äôs not doing anything special. Just what everyone else does. Cle, KC, Tampa, Atl all terrible defenses.
@Stikkity But he‚Äôs not gaining yards after breaking them.
@D_STROYAN So he started seeing better after 3 straight weeks of being blind? He had 17 yards on 8 carries against the Chiefs...the worst defense in football.
@Stikkity And that‚Äôs literally the only yards he created all day. 6 yards created in 19 carries.
@D_STROYAN You can if you bust a couple long runs where you aren‚Äôt having to make defenders miss.
@andyholloway https://t.co/d7wyHVJesh
@D_STROYAN 33rd in the league at getting yards that aren‚Äôt blocked for him. That‚Äôs not good. I‚Äôll congratulate him on a couple good runs against the Bengals today, tho. https://t.co/UdhKL20vwY
@andyholloway One at 18 yards, the other was like 45 yards downfield
@andyholloway 2 :)
@PaulPabst Nah - I‚Äôm not stressed. Just think there is so much comedy in game-planning in the NFL.
So there‚Äôs this free agent RB that‚Äôs a great receiving back and a better runner than our current starter...let‚Äôs give him $20M to sign, then not use him. #Titans #DionLewis
I think the Chiefs broke the Jaguars
Bears holder didn‚Äôt spin the ball. Laces left = slice.
Gore &gt; Drake
@ScottFish24 How many times did you say Diggs? :)
With a #Chiefs win tonight, the #Raiders will be mathematically eliminated from contention in the AFC West. #Jk #ButSeriously
@_ConwayTwitty_ That stat means he‚Äôs creating less than 1 yard per carry that isn‚Äôt blocked for him. #33 among RB in the league. That isn‚Äôt good.
@JourdanRodrigue https://t.co/VGUSYSPbT3
@_ConwayTwitty_ But he doesn‚Äôt gain any yards after breaking them. https://t.co/AE6YfECcqC
Wow, blatant false start by Chargers LT and not called. TD pass.
I may be in the minority here, but I don‚Äôt think James Conner is that great. I have yet to see a single play this season where he gets more yards than what is blocked for him.
What a catch by JuJu. My goodness.
@PeteAbe Long layoffs suck
@Richie59FIFTY @adamteicher Said nothing about any injury. Just don‚Äôt do stupid stuff that hurts your team.
@Richie59FIFTY @adamteicher You must not have watched the game. The play was over and he went after the guy who pushed him out of bounds just to talk trash and head-butted him. Nothing to do with playing aggressively. And not even 1/3 of his game check.
@Richie59FIFTY @adamteicher Yeah, making sure you don‚Äôt punch guys on the bottom of piles and head-butt guys really takes fun out of the game. All it does is cost your team 15 yards and gets you ejected. But ok.
@adamteicher Good. Play with a little discipline.

@MetcalfeCT @RapSheet Eh - he could‚Äôve been sick or something - I don‚Äôt doubt that that was possible, but if so, he shouldn‚Äôt have been playing special teams with less than 2 minutes left in a game they‚Äôre down by 21 https://t.co/Y3L4JxAgR8

@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro Lol now I know you‚Äôre just trolling. ESPN is mostly a joke.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro Ramsey has no respect for Hill. That‚Äôs why he ran his mouth about him not being a receiver and only being a ‚Äúreturn specialist‚Äù
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro To say that a guy was ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù when he was stopped on 2 plays is a joke.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro Dumbest tweet you‚Äôve sent yet. Assuming these stats are true, the fact that he was only in press coverage 3x the entire game vs Hill shows you how scared he was to man up with him. He knew he‚Äôd get burned, so he just let the Chiefs march down the field at will in front of him.
Another awesome moment tonight: my dude, Brock Holt, hitting for the first postseason cycle in MLB history...unreal! One of the best guys you‚Äôll ever meet. Couldn‚Äôt be happier for him!
Pretty awesome moment for Drew Brees. Having him mic‚Äôd up was neat, too...especially the moment with his kids.   Also awesome that TreQuan Smith‚Äôs 1st NFL TD ball will be displayed in the HOF for a long time...

@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro I was wrong. He has 0.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro He has 1 pass breakup.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro I never mentioned Hill in my tweet.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro There‚Äôs #2
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro So by your stats, he‚Äôs 2 for 7 in locking down his man in press coverage. Nice ratio.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro He‚Äôs beat him deep 3 times. 1 catch. 1 non-throw. And 1 where the safety broke it up. Hill was locked up twice.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro Who cares. They‚Äôre getting their butts kicked. Congrats on stopping a guy for 3 plays.
@King_Gregoro Ramsey isn‚Äôt shadowing Hill.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro 3 catches on those 7. 1 to Watkins, 1 to Conley, 1 to Hill.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro Well then tell him to stop doing it. He‚Äôs been in press coverage for 7 snaps today.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro Look at the stats. 7 catches allowed for 104 yards.
@SinoCalabasas @King_Gregoro He‚Äôs not shadowing anyone. Just hanging out on the left side of the field with safety help over the top.
@King_Gregoro Over 100 yards.
@King_Gregoro He‚Äôs allowed 7. 4 to Hill.
This is just complete domination #ChiefsKingdom

Let‚Äôs go @SanJoseSharks!! #NHLOpeningNight
@nycboy61 The reverse wouldn‚Äôt apply. If you‚Äôre in a play-in game, you‚Äôre not setting your rotation up for Wednesday bc Monday is all that matters.
@Raiderjoe_FO Maybe not. But it can definitely be better.
@Raiderjoe_FO Because TV dictates what day that game 1 of each series starts. And if they did the WCs on the same day, there‚Äôd be a day off before the first game 1. It‚Äôs dumb.
@Raiderjoe_FO Monday wasn‚Äôt a playoff game.
@nycboy61 You set your guy for Tuesday and if you get bumped to Wednesday, the same guy pitches. Easy.
@Raiderjoe_FO That puts one game in a non-prime time TV slot.
@nycboy61 Postseason schedule is released in August. And all I‚Äôm saying is they could say ‚Äúwild card games will be on Tuesday and Wednesday and we will determine which league‚Äôs wild card game at a later date...and wild card winners get a day off before their division game.‚Äù
@nycboy61 The Yankees and A‚Äôs have 2 days to rest their team, especially their bullpen, but the Rockies and Cubs didn‚Äôt... but none of them win their division. Why should they get an advantage?
@tboneryan3 @The_SportsPaige Wrong again. Monday is always left open for game 163.
@JeffreyHein7 @The_SportsPaige Why couldn‚Äôt the schedule be determined after the teams are set? There‚Äôs no reason except for they let TV control everything. I long for the day when there are games 163 and 164 and the entire postseason schedule is trashed.
@Friedmush85225 @mphdc15 You‚Äôre a douchebag for saying I was ‚Äúwhining‚Äù for voicing my opinion of what would make games better. So yep.
@Friedmush85225 @mphdc15 I‚Äôm not whining. Always trying to give fans a better product on the field. Rockies may win tonight, but they‚Äôre not at full strength.
@mlapides Re-read the post. While I get your sarcasm, I was talking about AL WC today, NL tmrw to give all teams a day off.
@Friedmush85225 @mphdc15 You could maybe see a better game if the Rockies pen wasn‚Äôt taxed. But it‚Äôs cool, keep being a douchebag.
@Da1307n Matters not
@bowlinbob Why couldn‚Äôt both be accomplished? The Rockies were in SF on Sunday, LA on Monday, and Chicago today. No reason the AL game couldn‚Äôt be today and Rockies/Cubs tmrw.
@mphdc15 But no one knew who would be playing in them - would be possible to just say there will be a WC game today and another tomorrow and figure out who using common sense
@LionoftheSenate False - union has no say in playoff scheduling
@JeffreyHein7 @The_SportsPaige The Yankees and A‚Äôs have 2 days to rest their team, especially their bullpen but the Rockies and Cubs don‚Äôt... but they didn‚Äôt win their division
@shortstop1999 @bigbenny999 He‚Äôs correct
@genegumbs60 Tickets are sold a month in advance with no date on them.   The Yankees and A‚Äôs have 2 days to rest their team, especially their bullpen but the Rockies and Cubs don‚Äôt... but they didn‚Äôt win their division
@aw_shiznit @The_SportsPaige The Yankees and A‚Äôs have 2 days to rest their team, especially their bullpen but the Rockies and Cubs don‚Äôt... but they didn‚Äôt win their division
@Smitty1569 @MLB @Cubs @Dodgers @Brewers @Rockies Because each team‚Äôs schedules are different. Their H2H record got them home field in game 163
@mphdc15 Tickets are sold a month in advance without a date on them.
@tboneryan3 @The_SportsPaige Then have a day of no baseball üôÄ
@fenway617 The Yankees and A‚Äôs have 2 days to rest their team, especially their bullpen but the Rockies and Cubs don‚Äôt... but they didn‚Äôt win their division
@bowlinbob The Yankees and A‚Äôs have 2 days to rest their team, especially their bullpen but the Rockies and Cubs don‚Äôt... but they didn‚Äôt win their division
MLB scheduling the Rockies/Cubs game today after both teams had a 1-game play-in yesterday is absolutely absurd. A little common sense flexibility could be used to play the AL game today &amp; NL game tomorrow &amp; give every team a day off. But common sense is so tough to find...
@justinreech @JeopardySports Um. Nope, he didn‚Äôt. Chief.
@andrewperloff Bottom line, it was 2nd and 30 and they gave it up in 2 plays.
@JeopardySports Another? He hasn‚Äôt lost any yet
@andrewperloff Yeah - I‚Äôve seen it a lot before. Because the official is instructed to look at the clock to see 0, then look down and see if the snap is occurring yet, it‚Äôs basically like there‚Äôs 0.5 seconds on the clock when it first shows 0.
@andrewperloff Soooo... excuse?
I got Gurley going for 350 total yards and Chiefs still winning the game. https://t.co/te5DVYqt54

@TheLostieLost @AdamSchefter Cam is actually bigger than Ben
@AdamSchefter So basically you can sack some QBs, but Cam Newton will never be going down.
@FGoobers @DFF_Dynasty @MyFantasyLeague Mixon may be back this week. But whether he‚Äôs hurt or not, if I had Gurley, I wouldn‚Äôt trade Gurley by himself for that package, let alone the other 2 players
@apboombox check dm please
@FGoobers @DFF_Dynasty @MyFantasyLeague Gurley is worth more than that package by himself
@andyholloway @FFHitman  @TheFFBallers hope you guys had fun tonight! Don‚Äôt really care if @jasonffl did, though, since he was badmouthing baseball on the show today.
@e_west14 How‚Äôs the sleeve length? I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù, 220 with kinda long arms
@e_west14 Got it - how do you order sizing? It says XL, which is what I normally wear, is a 56 - and that seems HUGE. Should I go a size down from normal?

@DIREWOLF817 @AgainChoke @STRobertson17 @mjmanson @mega_man20xx His foot is attempting to make contact. If he stays on his initial path, he would never be able to reach him. His hands are more of a distraction.
@DIREWOLF817 @AgainChoke @STRobertson17 @mjmanson @mega_man20xx Part 4 - you don‚Äôt have to actually make contact, just have to attempt to https://t.co/hv3dUB9wgg
@CNNTheNewfake Doesn‚Äôt have to be contact. You can‚Äôt change directions from your initial running path in an effort to break up a double play.
@AgainChoke @DIREWOLF817 @STRobertson17 @mjmanson @mega_man20xx The rules state that you can‚Äôt throw your arms up and you can‚Äôt change directions from your initial running path - and that has nothing to do with contacting the fielder or where the fielder is
@DIREWOLF817 @STRobertson17 @mjmanson @AgainChoke @mega_man20xx The rules DO state that you can‚Äôt throw your arms up and you can‚Äôt change directions from your initial running path

Final poll numbers are in:  Dbacks fans are 100% in agreement with my stance.  Rockies fans are ~98% against.  Neutral fans are ~98% in agreement.  Players that texted me are 100% in agreement.
Apparently my phone decided to send the 4th part of that thread at 1 am last night. That‚Äôs fun.
Even if he doesn‚Äôt make contact, he can‚Äôt deviate from his original path to 2nd base in an effort to break up a DP. The last photo clearly shows a changing of his path to 2nd base. Different rule, same call. https://t.co/JtMHKdjhFp
In reality, I just felt like increasing the number of Twitter users I have on my block list and thought the previous tweets would be a productive way to do it...
I will be the first to say that I didn‚Äôt get the job done after this play. But the inning should‚Äôve been over, and it should‚Äôve been 2-2 going to the bottom of the 8th.
He intentionally throws his arms in the air and makes contact with Nick‚Äôs left shoulder. You can see Nick‚Äôs sleeve move as a result. I don‚Äôt know how you miss this. https://t.co/PKRXDThJi0

@BaldyNFL @Chiefs @PatrickMahomes5 @steelers Good stuff. Hill was also wide open on that play. Steelers had no answers.
@jerlarson28 Good try. He has NOT done it before. And this team isn‚Äôt anywhere CLOSE to as good as the 2016 team was when he came close and when there were other weapons to take attention away. My post was also taking a shot at their D just getting run over by RBs the first 2 weeks.
H/T @GrahamBarfield https://t.co/ooXVFcRDBV
@NWalker1982 @jayjayGoFast That‚Äôs exactly my point! And that their D isn‚Äôt very good.
@ChefDaneSmith Hmm. I don‚Äôt remember stating personal stat goals for everyone to know and critique.
@jayjayGoFast @eldon2101 @NWalker1982 I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs the Bills still, but Cards don‚Äôt look good...
@AdamSchefter Rams don‚Äôt have cap room currently to add a player, right?
@PatMcAfeeShow @Chiefs I hear you. When I saw it live, I thought it was a big deke by Hill, because he was so far from where the ball was going. And by having the both guys back there with him, they could run the play no matter which side of the field the ball was kicked to.
@PatMcAfeeShow @Chiefs Did the Chiefs not send Hill 15 yards deeper than the ball on purpose to have the entire Steelers team run past the actual returner?
@OldTakesExposed Was that a secret twitter account of Vontae Davis?
@KatoOnTheTrack @SomeonesAnIdiot
@KatoOnTheTrack You still think that‚Äôs the president‚Äôs account. That‚Äôs cute. üòÇ
Do you think the reason David Johnson thought 1000 yards rushing and 1000 yards receiving was possible was because he was going against the Cardinals D every day in practice?
@JasonBarrTV That‚Äôs a proven relaxation technique. Plus, it waters his eyes to help keep vision sharp.

@BarryGalaxy 17% on a 65-yd FG? Hahahahahaha. Especially considering it‚Äôs NEVER been done in the NFL.
@garrettfross Big time
@Brake7878Jeremy @SiriusXMFantasy @Fantasy_Guru @caplannfl @CraigMish I don‚Äôt use it. Just approve the use. @SiriusXMFantasy didn‚Äôt ask for approval.
@SavageSznMedia Then you weren‚Äôt going to tie or take the lead in the first place, right? You can say the same thing about missing a FG on the last play of the game, assuming you got there.
If they go all the way down and score a TD with 20 sec or so left, then get the onside kick, they don‚Äôt have time to get in field goal range.
Someone explain this to me. If an NFL team is down by 9-11 points at the end of a game, why do they not kick a field goal once they‚Äôre in range, then give themselves a chance at an onside kick and Hail Mary?
@NFL @BuckCityBreaks @Chiefs @nflthrowback So are the 2018 Chiefs

@ChiefsReporter Meaning he‚Äôs been losing his Madden games and doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it.
@ByJoeDavis It‚Äôs the same reason everyone talks about the Browns in the NFL.
@LB3PTMAN @FantasyJuce @GrahamBarfield Exactly. One way or another, no matter where he‚Äôs lined up, he has to be off the line of scrimmage to have a chance.
@LaTroyHawkins32

@KleinschmidtJD Did he actually say ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù or were you texting him?
@MikeTagliereNFL *Jon: ‚ÄúWell, Mike, for us to target him, we prefer he get open, which requires him to run a route in a way that the DB doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing before he leaves the line of scrimmage.‚Äù
@FantasyJuce @GrahamBarfield It just took DBs a couple years of watching film to realize his tendencies‚Ä¶ Now they own him
I vividly remember the rage and sadness I felt 17 years ago today. To all those who have served, thank you. To all first responders, thank you. You all put your lives on the line daily for us, and today is a sobering reminder of how thankful we should be. #NeverForget
@GrahamBarfield I know Carr didn‚Äôt look good, but I honestly don‚Äôt think Cooper is a good WR. I had him as my #36 WR preseason.

Hey @businessinsider - I know this article is a little old. But the stuff in here about MLB players was literally never true. Not one piece of info. Just guessing for your facts? Is that standard practice? #fakenews  https://t.co/miFCO3CwUF
Matt Nagy learned his clock management skills from Andy Reid. #samesies
@thedthimesch @CheapFunBreaks Does ‚Äúsmush‚Äù translate in Japanese?
@ryenarussillo It‚Äôs because he was pretending to take a picture with Drake, and that‚Äôs an NCAA violation.
@MiKeMeUpP @dalton_kates That salary number can‚Äôt be right. If he had $10M bonus and $4M salary, that‚Äôs means he‚Äôd have had a 2019 salary of $19M if he was still on the roster in March. No way that was the #.
@MiKeMeUpP @dalton_kates The first year salary would‚Äôve been guaranteed, too, in addition to the bonus, right?
@Grudecks A team would trade for him for the last 6 games. No question.
@JohnBoschFF Maybe so, but he‚Äôs still gotta play at some point or he‚Äôs not a FA next year. Let him be someone else‚Äôs headache.
@RobertMassey3rd He has to if he wants to be a free agent
@adam_tenenbaum ‚ÄúI Want To Live‚Äù by @skilletmusic   Thank you!
@Grudecks He has to come back by week 10 or 11 or something to become a free agent. Otherwise, he‚Äôs in the same boat next year.
Put me down in the group that thinks the Steelers will trade Bell if he sits out 4+ games. ‚úåüèª
@TheCompanyGuy Then do both. He‚Äôs helping the Steelers this year, bc they have a RB who would‚Äôve been a 1st rounder had he not gotten cancer in college. And they‚Äôre saving $ by not paying Bell. I think the Steelers are totally fine.
@TheCompanyGuy If he sits out 9 weeks this year ($8M or so), and then gets hurt in one of the final few games, hows it going to look then when he doesn‚Äôt get that big payday?
@dalton_kates I don‚Äôt believe that they only offered $10M guaranteed. Fake news. He has $14M fully guaranteed on the table this year, so that offer wouldn‚Äôt make sense.
@peterock141979 Teams have a history of not paying RBs. Carlos Hyde has 1300 yds and 8 TDS last year, is younger than Bell, and got 3/$15M this year as a FA. Bell could make that much THIS YEAR if he didn‚Äôt sit out.
@RobertMassey3rd I‚Äôd stash that $ away and try to ball out this year. If he comes back in 8 weeks and isn‚Äôt as good, he‚Äôs not going to get Gurley $.
@RobertMassey3rd So the $12M last year and $14M this year don‚Äôt offer any security?
Amazing. #moreofthisplease https://t.co/5R547BGAEq
So if you‚Äôre a team looking at Lev Bell as a FA, would it not concern you that he‚Äôs willing to give up (potentially several) large game checks in a holdout? After he signs a new deal, what‚Äôs stopping him from doing this again in 2 years when he feels like he should be paid more?

@YahooSportsNFL All I‚Äôm saying is that the money that Gruden is making means NOTHING in the argument of whether or not they could‚Äôve or should‚Äôve signed Mack. Doesn‚Äôt even need to be mentioned, because it‚Äôs a completely different context.
$100M which doesn‚Äôt count against the cap. Bad parallel. It‚Äôs not that NFL teams don‚Äôt have money. They just can‚Äôt spend it all on players. https://t.co/85G7LfDi4f

@thoeye No earlier. 10-12 still. He won‚Äôt be a workhorse.

@Gostology It has nothing to do with the stoppage. It‚Äôs about continuing to play when you didn‚Äôt actually get touched. But instead the roll around like their leg is broken.   And it‚Äôs every 18 seconds. https://t.co/4AMDBGymu0
@Gostology ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Lost
@CardsFromAttic Didn‚Äôt say none. It‚Äôs exceptionally more rare tho. And typically caught by officials.
@DHern_30 In hockey, it‚Äôs every player, just like the NFL. They tuck them in their shoulder pads.
@DHern_30 When they hook little sensors to the players and track them, I‚Äôm inclined to believe them a little more than someone guessing...
@DHern_30 @poosealopolus This better? It‚Äôs where the data came from...  Hockey: https://t.co/kVAda730Ps  Soccer: https://t.co/vn39CvTHQi
@gerbear1258 But in hockey, they get penalized when they embellish. And they have 3 refs to watch for it.   Disagree w the baseball analogy. Even if they try to get hit, they are still getting hit by a 90+ mph ball.
@L_Zepeda6 If you actually get hit hard and need to down, fine. But I‚Äôve seen guys in every single game thus far that have been rolling around on the ground when they literally weren‚Äôt touched. Unwatchable.
@poosealopolus @DHern_30 Zero chance
@poosealopolus @DHern_30 Go ahead and show me the chubby hockey players. I‚Äôll wait. Most of them are lean and wear lots of padding.
@poosealopolus @DHern_30 Google how far soccer players run in a game. 7 miles. And they‚Äôre not constantly running. There‚Äôs a lot of down time. They‚Äôre in great shape, no doubt. But hockey is way more physical.
@poosealopolus It‚Äôs easy to judge when almost every replay shows that they embellish. It‚Äôs constant. All game long.
@900ddot009 It‚Äôs still rampant dishonesty. Want no part of it.
@DHern_30 I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a reason that‚Äôs the case... 5 miles of non-stop sprinting on the ice with gear and getting pounded? Or 7 miles of walking, jogging, and the occasional sprint? https://t.co/KFVt7KELwK
@cabby3939 Um, congratulations for knowing that?
@Nik_Rodriguez How is that different than a soccer team not playing for 5 days after each game?
@MrCSolar A few? There were at least 30 in that game. Unwatchable for the first 90 min.
@JPens4Real21 Um, do you want congratulations that you knew that?
I can‚Äôt watch the World Cup anymore. The number of players taking falls is just extraordinary. It‚Äôs every 2-3 minutes. Give me hockey any day ‚Äî where players play through broken bones instead of rolling around on the ground in ‚Äúagony‚Äù after an opponent breathed on them.
@WazNFL ‚ÄúNo way he‚Äôs going to maintain that efficiency...‚Äù

@BsblCards @Devlin_clark84 @Daniel_W43 @PatNeshek You didn‚Äôt send TTM. Period. Bc I‚Äôve signed every single one I‚Äôve ever gotten at the stadium in my entire career.
@BsblCards @Devlin_clark84 @Daniel_W43 @PatNeshek You. Asked. Me. During. A. Game.
@BsblCards @Daniel_W43 @Devlin_clark84 @PatNeshek Then you didn‚Äôt mail me anything
@BsblCards @Devlin_clark84 Again, I have no idea who you are.
@BsblCards If you understand we can‚Äôt sign during a game, then why are you complaining when I didn‚Äôt sign during a game?
@BsblCards I don‚Äôt even know who you are. I don‚Äôt pick and choose. If you ask me when I‚Äôm busy doing something, then sorry - this is a job. But otherwise, I sign for people every single day.
@BsblCards We aren‚Äôt allowed to sign autographs in the middle of game. If you‚Äôre going to hold that against me, so be it.

@Lane_Schartz I do think at this point Self is clean. I think he cares about his reputation enough to not be involved. But do I think the entire program is spotless? Probably not. Boosters and others do things that are impossible to monitor.
@Lane_Schartz I missed the rule where there are guidelines to trash talking. A little sensitive over there?
@Lane_Schartz Sean Miller was directly implicated. Big difference between that and some random guy giving a HS player money.
@ChecklistsforUS @FireHand17 Think it‚Äôs possible to physically cut smaller jersey relics?
@Lane_Schartz Name a KU official who‚Äôs been mentioned in any suspected infraction? I‚Äôll wait.
@23REES33 @KUTheShiver It ranks him somewhere around #700 in the country.
@darrenrovell Purchased by Sean Miller?
@darrenrovell Welp. He‚Äôll be remembered for 3 things now: bad shot selection, not playing defense, and suit shorts.

@DynastyFFTools It appears it‚Äôs not working...
@DynastyFFTools Will do - check them if you don‚Äôt mind, please - sent you a couple about 3 weeks ago - thanks!
@ByJoeDavis Oh, come on. The only competition he‚Äôs faced was in Missouri practices. He probably felt like KD and GA compared to the rest of that team.
@AllenWright4 hey! Mind checking dm? Thank you...
@DynastyFFTools do you check your reddit messages? found some glitches in your software and no response
@DickieV @HoopsWeiss @tsnmike @SethOnHoops @dandakich @espnbob Fair, and I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem if a HS coach was doing it, obviously. But these guys all have a lot of interaction with coaches recruiting them all year long - I‚Äôm just not sure these 2 weeks would make that much difference. But I respect your opinion.
@KleinschmidtJD It‚Äôs ok, Jess. I, too, missed that rule where having a blue checkmark requires you to interact with every person that ‚Äúmentions‚Äù you. Especially to those that utter death threats because you blew a save.

@IVIatt_Jones @AdamSchefter @FieldYates Illegally, maybe - Mark Ingram‚Äôs didn‚Äôt come out till after his appeal was heard.

@darrenrovell @aardodson Just imagine if they had to use more material to make them pants...
@krich1532 @DFF_Shane I think DJ has same role as before. Hyde and Chubb will battle for the other touches. He‚Äôs just too good to not give him the rock.
@krich1532 @DFF_Shane I think Howard is the 2-down back as always, but now in a better offense. Cohen is good in space but Nagy needs a grinder to open up the rest of the offense and take pressure off MT.   DJ way too talented to keep him off the field. Being drafted way too late.

@natemar3i0n @OldTakesExposed I mean, a lot can change in 5 months. Except the flopping. That‚Äôs a constant.

Congrats to @cj_wentz on his #RoyalWedding today.  Wait, that‚Äôs not him?
@ABREG_1 Same with pitchers. Know what you want to throw before you even toe the rubber for each pitch. Signs are just for the catcher to know what‚Äôs coming, IMO. Catchers need to learn their pitchers to know what they want to throw before a sign is given.

@GhettoCowboy @FantasyPros The Rockets did tip it. They touched it first on the rebound. But that had nothing to do with backcourt. After the shot hits something, someone on the offense has to have complete possession before backcourt can be called.
@FantasyPros Didn‚Äôt establish possession after the first shot went up. Not back court. Pretty pathetic defense, tho.

@Floridatarheel @TampaJHawk @Devonte_Graham4 @CoachBillSelf @iammaliknewman @KUHoops Nah - it wasn‚Äôt a lack of effort by Duke - it was just good execution by Kansas blocking out. That hasn‚Äôt been a strong point for KU this year, but you could tell it was a huge focus yesterday.
Couple thoughts: 1) hats off to Duke - great effort 2) KU outrebounded Duke - no one saw that coming 3) that game may have been even better than the hype - beginning to end - no team ever led by more than 7 4) LOVE the picture of @Devonte_Graham4 running to his mom! 5) #RockChalk https://t.co/91BUjZNYCE

@MikeDCtown @FG_Dolan Nah, I‚Äôd rather have the 50-50 shot at a long TD than just a random 15-yard penalty
@MarkMaske If they‚Äôre serious about safety, they need to make personal fouls overrule all other potential offsetting penalties. And enforce all 15 yards, even inside the 30.
@FG_Dolan Something tells me that if they do that, there will be a new record for pass interference penalties in the NFL this year
14 straight Big XII titles for @KUHoops. This has been Self‚Äôs best coaching job. Unreal. #RockChalk
@ByJoeDavis Well, he hadn‚Äôt earned the right to make that choice yet. Play a couple more years like everyone else has to before you start trying to dictate where you go. Selfish.
@PFF_Sam @PFF Including doing everything he can to avoid tackling a ballcarrier. It‚Äôs pretty impressive.
I hope the Chiefs got a decent return for Peters, but the fact that only 2 teams were interested in him speaks volumes about his reputation in the game. Not many willing to tolerate dissonance.

@FantasyPros Maybe the Chiefs will announce that.
This one hurts. Changes are coming. Was a fun year for most of it. #ChiefsKingdom
@msu1983 @andrewperloff Accidentally, no, but when you duck and lead with your head to make a tackle, it‚Äôs not an accident. I said before that if a pitcher intentionally hits a batter and he goes on the DL, pitcher should miss that many games, too.
@anfernee2323 That‚Äôs why they use an independent doctor to diagnose it
@LaichItIs What stops them from doing that now?
I‚Äôve said this before, and I‚Äôll say it again. If a player is concussed from a helmet-to-helmet hit and forced to miss the rest of the game, the player that made the hit should miss the rest of the game as well.

@FakeSportsCentr @PatMcAfeeShow #ForTheBrand
@FG_Dolan Let‚Äôs be honest. All parties involved know the Pats have already won this coin toss.
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees And I know for a fact strength of schedule in NFL is determined by previous year‚Äôs record
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees According to that graphic, they could do it 3 years in a row. 2019 says same thing as 2018.
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees Bills game was a home game, also.
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees Dolphins game was in KC week 16. Not a road game.
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees Do you not remember the Chiefs playing the Pats the opening game of the season in Foxboro? Not sure where you‚Äôre getting your graphics. Jets was a road game, also.
@smcmac321 @Chiefs So Steelers at home in ‚Äò15 and ‚Äò17, but on road in ‚Äò18?
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees And if you‚Äôre bringing baseball into it, how come Oakland came to AZ two straight times for interleague (2012 and 2015)?
@smcmac321 @Chiefs @Yankees So 2 years in a row in NE is normal? Got it.
@smcmac321 @Chiefs Yeah, you‚Äôre right. Playing Pitt, Seattle, and LA on the road is easier than playing them at home.

@The_Oddsmaker check dm if you have a sec, please - thx
@The_Oddsmaker Quick Q: is Brady at #3 QB this week based some on name value? It‚Äôs been pretty rough the last 3 weeks, with the exception of 4th Q last week. Considering starting Foles over him based on matchup and Eagles‚Äô propensity to throw. Thoughts?
@SNCSeggie Fire them
@AmazinHOF @mk9577 No knobs or barrels
@Mrs_McCarthy32 Says the person who spent last weekend with no cell service
Laces left.
@Bmiller3114 Missed 3 games. Evans has 55 catches and 4 TD‚Äôs in 12 games before tonight.
So why hasn‚Äôt Jameis done this all season? Chuck it up to Evans and let him make a play. Double coverage? Doesn‚Äôt matter.
@tbhawkins A penalty for fumbling out of bounds? No! I‚Äôd be up for all fumbles out of bounds being turnovers. The offensive player screwed up. He shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded just because he was near the sideline.
@andrewperloff So you think this should be given back to the Broncos since the ensuing scrum for the ball knocked it out of the end zone? https://t.co/pTIFuapJ6Z
@andrewperloff @dpshow That‚Äôs incorrect. It‚Äôs AT LEAST every other game, even if it‚Äôs not a pivotal call. It‚Äôs 1-2 plays a week where it‚Äôs game-changing. The problem is there is too much interpretation. If you go back to the old rule, 2 feet down with complete control, there‚Äôs way less interpretation.
So just to be clear, all of you who feel like fumbling out of bounds through the end zone feel like the Broncos should‚Äôve been given the ball back at the 1-yard line (spot of the fumble) in this video?   Yeah, I‚Äôll never agree with that argument. https://t.co/pTIFuapJ6Z
@KartikRishabh But incomplete passes aren‚Äôt turnovers. Ever. Fumbles are. Often.
@KartikRishabh An incomplete pass is WAY different than fumbling the ball.
@cali4life13 Only in the final 2 min of the game. The rest of the game, it‚Äôs a live ball for anyone to recover.
@21jbert21 @sonofLargeMark I don‚Äôt see it as a lousy rule. Protecting the ball is one of the most important parts of the game. It‚Äôs even more critical when you‚Äôre in FG range to tie the game.
@cali4life13 Nope - if a player intentionally makes it go through the end zone, it‚Äôs a penalty
@21jbert21 @sonofLargeMark Bc it‚Äôs high risk, high reward. You wanna reach for the TD, go for it. But there‚Äôs a risk in doing so.
@21jbert21 @sonofLargeMark If you fumbled the ball, you screwed up. Esp in the red zone. Punishment SHOULD be harsh.
People are saying it‚Äôs bc it‚Äôs the only place on the field that you fumble out of bounds and lose possession. Well, It‚Äôs also the only place on the field where if you reach the ball across a line, you get points. How about don‚Äôt fumble the ball and you don‚Äôt turn it over...
@ColemanSwierc @ScottJenstad Caused a fumble
@ColemanSwierc @ScottJenstad It‚Äôs also the only place on the field where if you reach the ball across a line, you get points.
Can someone tell me why the fumble-through-the-endzone touchback is considered a controversial rule? To me, it‚Äôs completely logical...unlike the catch rule.
@ScottJenstad @Jeff_Erickson It‚Äôs a fallacy to begin with, because no Chiefs fan would ever date a Raiders fan. If they do, they‚Äôre not truly a Chiefs fan.
@DewMe978 @AdamSchefter X-rays, yes - but MRI always at hospital
@AdamSchefter Probably for MRI, no? Teams don‚Äôt have those machines on hand.
@Jeff_Erickson @RotoWire @claywlink It would almost fit in the new Twitter
@SiriusXMFantasy You do realize that McCoy is over 1000 yards already through 13 games, right? And that includes weeks 2 and 3 when he combined for 30.
@msimonespn I think this is a little miscalculated. That‚Äôs how the media viewed Morris and didn‚Äôt elect him. So numbers-driven. The players that played against him knew how dominant he was - and his mentality of staying in games longer to save pen, sometimes at the expense of his own ERA.
It‚Äôs about time! https://t.co/WVep1tbhP3
Everyone keeps saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs because it‚Äôs against the Raiders...‚Äù  The same Raiders who are the 6th best team in the NFL at not giving up sacks? They‚Äôve given up 1.5/game this year before today. 3 today and another hit on Carr that caused an INT.
Out of curiosity, does anyone know where the Chiefs found their pass rush? It‚Äôs been missing for a couple months... I missed the Schefter/Rapoport report where it‚Äôd been located.

@TradingCardBlog @AmazinHOF @UpperDeckSports Going to say neither. Hitters USUALLY put their name up or down, so contact wouldn‚Äôt be on any points of marking. Doesn‚Äôt look retouched to me. Just wear and tear fading caused by putting bat in bat rack or dropping it on ground, etc...

Is Babe Laufenberg the QB for the Cowboys right now?
@andrewperloff Inspirational play
@FG_Dolan He needs a LT
@PFF Do you guys keep stats on what % of fade routes work in the red zone? I‚Äôve never been a fan of pass plays that only have one pre-determined option, &amp; it seems like fade routes are low-percentage plays. Thanks for your time. (FWIW, I‚Äôd count PI &amp; catches both as a successes)
@McShay13 And a good arm
@Jeff_Erickson @scott_pianowski Not to mention a HORRIBLE unnecessary roughness call on the end of that play

@clarkspencer @SiriusXMFantasy Field goals are fine, but the Steelers are ranked 31st in red zone TD %. That won‚Äôt win many games in January.
@clarkspencer @SiriusXMFantasy So that was a constant. But Bell had 15 more touches in the 2nd half than the 1st. Which shows a drastic shift in game plan at halftime. And 7 of those 2nd half throws were to him, so more high %.
@clarkspencer @SiriusXMFantasy Steelers were up by some field goals bc Mariota had more targets to Steelers players than Ben did
@clarkspencer @SiriusXMFantasy They were 10-22 passing in the first half. That‚Äôs not good. Bell has 15 touches in the 2nd half. That‚Äôs not a coincidence.
@SiriusXMFantasy @TheMattCamp @FG_Dolan I‚Äôd kicking a FG to go up 23 with 5 min left running it up? Feel like I‚Äôve seen more teams just run a running play there this year to avoid the look
@SiriusXMFantasy Bell has 4 carries, Ben has 22 pass attempts. They deserve to lose for this stupidity.
@FG_Dolan @FG_Brolley Agreed - even if he didn‚Äôt stop, it was a soft cut - no aggressiveness in the route
@apboombox @espn @SomeonesAnIdiot
@OldTakesExposed @bgoldgrab True - but what if Peterman is better and Benjamin takes off? What if he saw this move coming all along? ‚úçüèª

@BarstoolMizzou With how bad you guys suck at everything, it‚Äôs easy to forget that you have sports at your college.
@FG_Dolan My response: Wentz would make Kenny Britt look good.
@DHuddy41 Tolerable. The other one isn‚Äôt.
@DHuddy41 Ugh. That makes it worse. Completely intolerable.
@ScottJenstad Big Pats fans, those NKOTB guys are... and that‚Äôs still way better than Sarkisian‚Äôs 2 playcalls from the 1-inch line
@FG_Dolan Exactly what I just said
Sarkisian should be fired for those 2 play calls alone. Horrendous.
You don‚Äôt have to be a UNC fan to feel this is cringe-worthy. Who in the world thought this was a good idea? @DHuddy41 https://t.co/3f4d0v096Q
@ModestoBeek Fair enough :) but Cook got up and celebrated before he even looked at ref. And it was a long enough pass that it would‚Äôve taken longer.
@cdun12 We at least get some good wins each season
@ModestoBeek Such a homer - they wouldn‚Äôt have been at the line to snap in 10 seconds
What a terrible loss. Our D is soft. Rarely force punts. Almost no QB pressure. If we don‚Äôt get a turnover, can‚Äôt stop anyone from marching.
This sucks for the Chiefs - if correct call had been made (no TD), clock would‚Äôve kept running.
About time for one of those long, late-game Kareem Hunt TD‚Äôs...
Yeah, totally legal. Forgot about those rules the NFL approved to make it a little more dangerous for players to add more fan excitement. https://t.co/MLiiI1uNX5
Just curious when it became legal in the NFL to rip a player‚Äôs helmet off...?

@FG_Dolan Only in the SEC
@cameron954 Zero chance. Not in that game. Plus, just watch his reaction.
@FlyforaWeitzguy It says he has to ‚Äúinterfere with the fielder taking the throw‚Äù...but he wasn‚Äôt in the fielder‚Äôs way of the player throwing.
@FlyforaWeitzguy But it shouldn‚Äôt have interfered unless the throw was offline. I don‚Äôt think Rizzo catches it if it doesn‚Äôt hit him. Has to be catchable.
@FlyforaWeitzguy Throw was offline. Zim was all the way inside the baseline. C &amp; 1B were outside the baseline (foul territory). Online throw doesn‚Äôt hit him.
IMO, this rule wasn‚Äôt applied correctly at end of Cubs/Nats. Rizzo &amp; Contreras were outside baseline. Zim was inside. Not in throwing lane. https://t.co/By9zvXiVZW

Appreciate the dialogue and response from everyone. A few of my light-hearted observations on a very serious topic... #ExtendTheNets https://t.co/lOyrOj6cb5
@Y2BANE @MeLlamoTrevor One easy one: first base coach killed in minor league game. It‚Äôs not about being reactive. It‚Äôs being preventative.
@JMKRIDE_Jon @JakeGullekson55 Not the same risk. Balls slow down drastically by then. More time to see it coming. Logic.
@weezie48867 @Ken_Rosenthal Guessing the fans at the new Atlanta ballpark have no complaints about their experience this year. Ask someone who‚Äôs experienced it.
@Y2BANE @MeLlamoTrevor That‚Äôs not true. But good try.
@CornhuskerMax @Ken_Rosenthal Zero chance. College bats don‚Äôt allow exit velo that high.
@AllenSturgill @Ken_Rosenthal Because the seats behind home plate aren‚Äôt premium?
@joefay1 @Ken_Rosenthal Fans are closer, pitchers throw harder, exit velos are higher than ever before. Not the same game.
@JMKRIDE_Jon @JakeGullekson55 You can take the risk of not wearing one, but it doesn‚Äôt make it a good choice.
@JMKRIDE_Jon @JakeGullekson55 When one side is for convenience and the other side is for safety of everyone involved, there‚Äôs no argument. Like wearing a seatbelt.
@weezie48867 @Ken_Rosenthal Not to mention other fans in front of them reaching for the ball as it passes by can be a huge distraction even for the most attentive fan
@weezie48867 @Ken_Rosenthal You assume that everyone hit wasn‚Äôt paying attention. Maybe the ball was hit so hard they simply couldn‚Äôt get out of the way.
@CornhuskerMax @Ken_Rosenthal ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è has never caught a 105-mph, curving line drive from 100 feet away.

@OohGoldy2Homers @Andy_Williams16 Nope, just admitting my mistake
@Double_O_Slevin @BuckCityBreaks @WatchTheBreaks Whose jersey is that?
@Biracialguy @WillisWrldPeace Already acknowledged that I didn‚Äôt know ‚Äúweek 0‚Äù existed
@MannyA_Gil He actually won week 0. I didn‚Äôt realize it. Kaepernick won week 1, which is all I‚Äôd heard about.
@Andy_Williams16 @AdamSchefter Nah, I‚Äôll admit my mistakes. Didn‚Äôt know week 0 existed.
@CoreyP_19 @AdamSchefter Apparently he won the award for ‚Äúweek 0,‚Äù which I didn‚Äôt know existed
@WillisWrldPeace @AdamSchefter Didn‚Äôt realize there was a week 0. My bad.
@WillisWrldPeace @AdamSchefter Kaepernick?
@JBower4 @JakeGullekson55 All people are at risk when a 105-mph, curving line drive is coming. There‚Äôs a reason 3rd basemen miss some. And they‚Äôre looking for it.
@JBower4 @JakeGullekson55 How many times does it need to be said? This is not just about kids.
@AdamSchefter When will JJ Watt be recognized for almost single-handedly uniting the country to help Houston recover?
@fantasy_spy @CTowersCBS Not just kids. All people are at risk when a 105-mph, curving line drive is coming. There‚Äôs a reason 3rd basemen don‚Äôt catch every one.
@lawrenceb34 @davewright21568 Enjoy watching the game thru a net. Or from the outfield. Bc it‚Äôs coming to every park.
@lawrenceb34 @davewright21568 So by your logic, all beer sales must be prohibited in lower levels too, bc consumption slows reaction time.
@lawrenceb34 I could give you a glove, put you 80 ft from a machine throwing a slicing ball @ 105 mph &amp; I guarantee u don‚Äôt catch it, knowing it‚Äôs coming
@lawrenceb34 I‚Äôm going to go ahead and guess, too, that you haven‚Äôt seen the replay. You‚Äôre just assuming.
@lawrenceb34 When a ball is hit that hard, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre locked into the game. Fans won‚Äôt catch it. Not that close to the field.
@lawrenceb34 WAY less than half of foul balls in baseball are caught. And ones over 100 mph are basically never caught in seats above dugout.
@KJTheSportsGuy Anyone‚Äôs life is at risk above the dugout. Every single night. It‚Äôs not worth that risk.
@KJTheSportsGuy I‚Äôve seen, literally, hundreds of games behind netting. It doesn‚Äôt matter. You get used to it.
@adamteicher ...assuming Smith continued playing really well and they found a way to keep his contract? Team is in win-now situation.
@adamteicher Re: your Smith article...excited about Mahomes, but would it be awful if he sat for 2 years? Similar to Rodgers behind Favre...
@KJTheSportsGuy Like I said, someone else will gladly buy your seat.
@KJTheSportsGuy You can get a foul ball in almost any seat in the park. And players still sign in the parks with extended netting.
@KJTheSportsGuy Doesn‚Äôt mater if it‚Äôs a kid or not. There has never been a game in history where every fan paid attention to every pitch.
@lawrenceb34 Yeah, you‚Äôre right. That 2-year-old in NY that almost died earlier this week just can‚Äôt stay off of Facebook.
The thing that‚Äôs really sad about this is it took the near-death of a 2-year-old girl (still praying for her) for some teams to make change.
@JakeGullekson55 What part exactly do you disagree with? That another fan would gladly take your seat? Your view of a game is worth more than someone‚Äôs life?
@AdamSchefter This is nothing. Wait till Kareem Hunt has 8 after Sunday.
@JakeGullekson55 Then you‚Äôre wrong on this one. Period.
@PaulHembo @MikeAndMike It‚Äôs only Sept 22. There‚Äôs time.
@andrewperloff Still a limit. Just a lot more distance between you and where that line is.
A note to anyone complaining about teams extending netting and not wanting to ‚Äúpay for an obstructed view‚Äù: stay home. https://t.co/CpbXDkjcLp
@sixdruminone @TSA Appreciate the offer. I‚Äôll figure it out. Just annoyed.
@AskTSA Have never known food items to be banned.
@bmitchelf Just something small from our last road trip. Wisconsin known for cheese. He loves eating it.
@ferreira0925 @TSA Not birthday. Just a gift from where I was on a road trip.
@B_gregory They didn‚Äôt. They confiscated cheese I had brought him from Wisconsin. But I also had electronics in my bag, which I didn‚Äôt want to check.
@B_gregory They confiscated it at security. You said to check my bag, which would‚Äôve likely ended up with things ‚Äúmissing‚Äù had I done that.
@IVIatt_Jones @TSA Not a prohibited item. Unless cheese from Wisconsin was recently added to the banned list.
@B_gregory Guessing you‚Äôve never checked a backpack full of electronics. Your bag tends to show up with less in it than when you checked it.
Hey @TSA -thanks for confiscating the gift I had for my son. Can‚Äôt wait to to tell him I no longer have what I‚Äôd said I was bringing to him.

@_LaFuriaRoja @PFF_NateJahnke @PFF Not a comparison - just stating that projecting x8 what's happened thru 2 weeks doesn't make sense. Like Pats will go 8-8 and Chiefs 16-0.
@Chris_Liss @Jeff_Erickson @SiriusXMFantasy @RotoWire @TRay0128 I would just wait beyond 2 weeks to put him on that poll. I mean, Crowder, Marshall, Matthews have on the SEASON what Hill had in week 2.
@Chris_Liss @Jeff_Erickson @SiriusXMFantasy @RotoWire @TRay0128 But how many WR can take a dink to the house? He has that threat EVERY TIME he touches the ball.
@Jeff_Erickson @SiriusXMFantasy @RotoWire @Chris_Liss @TRay0128 #3 WR in PPR so far
@Jeff_Erickson @SiriusXMFantasy @RotoWire @Chris_Liss @TRay0128 Gotta question that logic. Only about 100 WR with worse stats lol.
@SiriusXMFantasy @RotoWire @Jeff_Erickson @Chris_Liss How is Tyreek Hill in this poll? He has 11 catches, 176 yds, and a TD through 2 weeks...?
@PFF_NateJahnke @PFF By this logic, Kareem Hunt is on pace to score 40 TD's ... I love PP, but let's get a bit more for a sample size
@BSmile @BlowoutBuzz @UniWatch @PhilHecken @darrenrovell
@Art_Mah Need you to follow me for that
@Art_Mah That would be AWESOME. Thank you so much!
@Devonte_Graham4 Agreed. It's only cocky when you start telling everyone about it.
@ScottJenstad They're not used to that situation mattering much
@clarkspencer It's a little different when you know going into the race that the horse is the GOAT and you pick against him
@PFF I think that 6 missed tackles # is low. He had 4 just on the one reception in the first half!
@clarkspencer Patriots are done, you're right... üòÇ
@sanford943 Again, while not great, it's not as big of a deal when you only play 13 games in a season.
@mdukesportsguy @msimonespn @statcast Not sure what you're getting at then. Bc every ball put in play is in that stat, even if it bounced before they made contact.
@mdukesportsguy @msimonespn @statcast Every pitcher has allowed balls to be put in play in their career. Collectively, we are sorry to disappoint the fans who expect perfection.
@mdukesportsguy @msimonespn @statcast Every pitch is "hittable" unless the batter can't pyisically reach it
@mdukesportsguy @msimonespn @statcast Who said anything about "super hittable"? That's just # of balls in play out of 203 batters faced
@sanford943 But they play, what, 13 a year? We play 162.
@A_Hudy The look on Preston's face in the background üî•
@Jeff_Erickson Andy Dalton would do it on his own if he were batting
@FG_Dolan Yep - there's Marvin Lewis, then there's Andy Reid. One had the player of the week. One now has crushed the confidence of his 1st Rd pick.
@ThatTallRussian @amandabrazil29 It wasn't a tie. They replayed it from the beginning the next day as part of a doubleheader that the Giants swept.

@ScottJenstad No
@Jeff_Erickson @ScottJenstad I'm sure. But I wonder if the teams that were really bad today re-evaluate worth of preseason playing time.
@Jeff_Erickson @ScottJenstad Even 3. I get that they want to evaluate some. But they should have their starters playing more than 3 quarters of football in a month.

@ChecklistsforUS @RichLayton42 National Treasures is my jam now. It's the only product that's constantly adding new relics of older players.
@CJNitkowski Adjustment would take all of 2 weeks. Just like the clock between innings.
@CJNitkowski I'm in favor of it. Easiest way to get pace of game and game length improved. Zero discussion of zone. Not a different zone game to game.
@red_zed24 @CJNitkowski Wrong. When it reached the plate, it clipped the bottom of the zone. Look at the graphs CJ posted.
@CJNitkowski Bottom line: it SHOULD be called more right now than it is.
@CJNitkowski If you throw a ball in that tiny box &amp; hitter doesn't swing, it doesn't matter if it's not commonly called. If went thru the box. Period.
@CJNitkowski Why is it a disaster if the pitch crossed through the strike zone? Just bc umps don't call it consistently doesn't mean it isn't a strike.

Also on my National wish list: anything of me serial numbered to 50 or less or any of my '16 Museum Collection autos/relics. For my kids.
@FG_Dolan He also could've said "Alshon is simply the best WR I've ever played with." Then added "Only DGB comes close" for a laugh.
@BossHardy202 No, but be on the lookout for stuff I might like please!
Re: The National - looking for HOF bat knobs &amp; barrels (nameplates only, not Limited Lumber). If you see one, lmk, please... thanks in adv!
Hey, tweeps - who's going to The National?
@JimmyBozz @hollytime28 Managers don't pick the team anymore. Commissioner's office picks the reserves now.
@MoWhiteSox76 Buster was worthy of the start, but JT should've been there
Should've been an All-Star. https://t.co/VpCjFmJqAZ
Words can't express the sorrow I feel for John Rheinecker's family. Great player &amp; teammate. Praying for God's peace &amp; comfort as they cope.
@SiriusXMFantasy personal fouls should overrule any other potential offsetting penalty &amp; always be enforced the full 15, even inside the 30
@JamesGerard518 @FantasyPros It's bc your #1 strength is TE and #3 is DST! #mediocre  Jk :)

@NBA_Jayhawks Is the goal to lure Self into coaching? Lol
@darrenrovell My fault - wasn't aware of that circumstance. Assumed it was agreed to before contract was signed.
@darrenrovell He chose to defer it during the contract?
@darrenrovell You also have to assume that if he wasn't willing to defer it, he wouldn't have gotten it at all.
I hope they file assault charges for whoever just hit Joe West with the baseball. Absolutely ridiculous.
@PatNeshek @BulldogBeing You were teammates with Jimmie Foxx?
@dpshow @CallawayGolf Dan: "I just can't stop looking at myself in that huge mirror..." Paulie: "That's what that is?"
@pobguy @mitchellichtman @No_Little_Plans Agreed, but doesn't mean there's no effect. When you pitch in Colorado, your ball moves less. One of the reasons it's good to hit there.
@mitchellichtman @No_Little_Plans @pobguy How does that even make sense? Less drag makes a ball fly further but doesn't affect when a pitch is thrown?
@No_Little_Plans Not to mention that movement on pitches would decrease as well, which makes hitting easier...
Tremendous... https://t.co/Gb91QTSTok

@dpshow Did his family member write this post? Who actually calls him "Todd"?
@Sara_Walsh @Busch26 One more reason why the bullpen is better...
@EricBoston3 Don't know who that is
@Super_Dave @MLB @statcast Well, that is definitely possible. Park elevation, humidity, wind, etc can all play into it.
@MLB So 13 rows deep is 489'...but Ozuna's in Tampa over every seat they have and off the flag at the top of the dome was 450'?
@julioattheshop @andrewperloff But that doesn't mean they couldn't. Warriors couldn't play physical like the teams of the 90s. They'd be too banged up to shoot as well.
@andrewperloff Ok, fair. I was thinking more 90s anyway. Bulls, Pistons, Knicks, etc
@Weinham @andrewperloff Exactly my point. McHale did something about it. Wouldn't happen in today's game.
@andrewperloff Back in the 80's, they played a ton of defense. And it was tough, physical defense. You didn't come down the lane without getting laid out.
@andrewperloff If those teams were playing today, they'd have the same training methods. But they were all mentally tougher. Zero question. Old teams win.
@mwj5596 @JB1544 Nope - but congrats on the block
@draiche 11-39 from 3-pt range? Not typical. Averaged about 40% on the year as a team. Steph and KD 2-9 each? Not typical.
Amazing: took Cavs' best game of season &amp; GS off night for Cavs to win &amp; now ppl pick Cavs? No way it happens 3x more. GS by 10+ in gm 5.

@ryenarussillo Nope, only a 59" vertical fake. The show is actually pretty entertaining. Better than several NBA dunk contests of late.
@ryenarussillo Zero chance that's a legit vert. That would mean standing still, he could jump up and look down thru the rim. No.
@ImFasterThanYa It's appears your boy wants to host a team bbq
@fe320cbc423c4de @andrewperloff Disagree. Those matter, but when watching on TV, there are replays between every play. Constant motion. Why the Red Zone channel is popular.
@andrewperloff No, I mean Americans want action. That's why soccer isn't as popular here. We are an impatient society, unfortunately. Need instant thrill.
@andrewperloff Could say the same thing about sheer action.

@BillyBarou2U @espn Lol. This is the dumbest argument ever. Everyone says this as if we aren't allowed to be human bc of our salaries. Done w this thread.
@BillyBarou2U @espn From the beginning, they let ESPN (and $) dictate too much
@BillyBarou2U @espn For instance, Red Sox and Royals on July 30. Right now, it shows game time "TBD" on the schedule. It's an option for ESPN.
@BillyBarou2U @espn No, ESPN picks their game a couple weeks in advance and it gets moved to a night game to accommodate
@BillyBarou2U @espn You can't give all 6 teams a guaranteed Monday off. Gets too complicated.
@BillyBarou2U @espn You think that hasn't been discussed prior? One problem is the they give ESPN 3 options for what later-season game they broadcast #flexsched
@SonicBaseball Cubs flight prob left Boston at 1 am last night.
@SonicBaseball Good stuff. The only thing you didn't really address is that for players, flights don't take off for 2.5 hrs after getaway game is over.
@BillyBarou2U @espn 6:30-7? You shouldn't have teams boarding planes at 1 AM to fly to the next city &amp; play a game today after 5 am hotel arrival.
@jimbielar @espn Same story in July
@paulpierce34 Those of us who first watched you in Lawrence will always remember you as a Jayhawk first before any other team comes to mind. Great career.
@pges @espn That is for our benefit. We always travel to a new city after those games. Allows us to fly out by 7 pm
@Bankers_Box @espn But if it started at 3:30 or 4 pacific and went till 7-7:30, wouldn't that be better for everyone?
Hey @espn, 8 pm starting time on Sunday is one of the dumbest things in baseball today. Casual fan is not going to watch after 4th inning.
@JRFoundation @GoldinAuctions I think this ended last night...
@TheDA53 @jefflipack @Buster_ESPN @Haudricourt Twice in ST, 3 during the season. Also had an off-season test at home.
@jefflipack @TheDA53 @Buster_ESPN @Haudricourt A few years ago, we changed the system to where each player could be tested an unlimited amount of times in a season.
@TheDA53 @jefflipack @Buster_ESPN @Haudricourt That's not true. I've been tested 5 times already this year.
@AdamSchefter @darrenrovell How much did the policy cost?
@Kevin_Noon @BlowoutBuzz @dallascowboys Bell
@The_SportsPaige Payton, Singletary, and Urlacher aren't there anymore
@The_SportsPaige You have to have expected this stuff. It's not like you just jumped on the burning bandwagon...
@Francisk54 Yeah, ok. 7th most points in NFL. Reid is a QB expert. If that's who he wanted, that's who I wanted them to get.
@tylerjude01 Eh. 2 late 1sts and a 3rd for the guy they think is their franchise QB? In a heartbeat.
@Francisk54 You think they give up a 1st and 3rd to get a QB they don't like?
I love it. The Chiefs never trade up in the 1st. So if they did, they LOVE him... I'm in!
Whoever the @Chiefs are taking here, I'm loving this aggression!
I'm guessing Niners at least feigned they had an offer to trade down and it was another team that wanted a QB, right?
@Fantasy_Guru @SiriusXMFantasy Since when are you a second baseman?
@MikeAndMike @ChickiesnPetes You should come catch the Marlins game in the afternoon before the draft

@darrenrovell @PPFpretzels Sounds like something they should do for draft picks playing AGAINST the Eagles
@FoxNews @ReedTimmerAccu
@MyOwnCreation82 Yeah, they don't do that much in baseball, but I've noticed it in football a lot.
@yanks2020 Again, some people are loyal to cards - plus, way less display space taken up
@yanks2020 Do you realize what a Mantle or Ruth game bat sells for? Topps would have to charge $50k per box to make a profit
@MoxyCoxy24 If it says "game used," it probably is. Sometimes, and in football more often than not, it will say player worn instead of game used.
@BigCougSteve But when you read the fine print on football cards, it's VERY rare that it says "game-used"
@BigCougSteve In football games, players keep their jerseys and use a new one each game. That's why they trade them all the time after games.
Yes - and they'll have the players put on 20 jerseys while they're there, just so they can claim "player-worn" or "event-worn" https://t.co/RCrdI4Exv8
@BigCougSteve Just saying - if you read the fine print, many many jersey relics are not game-worn
@RacingClubXXI__ I would guess on current players, Topps/Panini buy them off the MLB auction site. They def don't ask me for anything.
@BigCougSteve How many people can afford a bat used in a game by Mantle? For some people, owning a small piece of history is special...
@BigCougSteve ...of each color
@BigCougSteve We don't wear 162 different jerseys. Usually 1-2 a year except for the holiday games.
@ggarfinkel Understandable too - some are loyal to card collecting tho
@BigCougSteve Fair, but that relic is taken off a BP jersey worn at the AS game, not the game itself - does that not turn you off of it a bit?
@BigCougSteve And a knob/barrel isn't a "chip" of wood - screenshots taken off Twitter/eBay https://t.co/nS9G4XsvGb
@BigCougSteve Baseball jerseys are game-used more often than football
@yanks2020 But what if the estates of those players sold them to the card companies? Happens all the time
No. Most people don't even pay attention. Probably 90% of football jersey relics in cards are from jerseys worn at a random off-field event. https://t.co/JE1n0Y5qvR
@yanks2020 Even if the players sell it to the card companies themselves? That happens a lot
@BigCougSteve Even if they just randomly wear it? Have u seen "jerseys" football players wear for card companies? Knobs/barrels have TONS of visual appeal
A little surprised at high appeal of jersey cards, esp when many are "player-worn" &amp; not "game-used." Thought knobs/barrels would be higher. https://t.co/MvnuQsbGPt
Solid. https://t.co/stqJg9QfOZ
Alright card people, have a poll for you. Which do you like best?
Well, that was a fun series... #walkoff #LetsGoFish
@BigOrangeHill If it's NOT 2 different levels, then how he did vs each one is irrelevant. His total stats are all that matter at that point.
@BigOrangeHill You're joking right? Just bc they're not power 5 doesn't mean there aren't good teams and players. They're still D-1.
@BigOrangeHill If an all-star major league pitcher goes to the minors on a rehab assignment and gets shelled, does that mean he can't pitch in the majors?
@BigOrangeHill You can - you just don't differentiate between levels of competition.
@BigOrangeHill @MikeAndMike No - but stats against 2 different levels of competition don't matter unless the other factors are all the same.

@RednckTruckrHat @The_RealJordan @EzTheProphet @richeisen His entire foot has to be in bounds for him to be considered not out of bounds
@EzTheProphet @RednckTruckrHat @richeisen He's only considered "over the line" if his entire foot is over the line
@EzTheProphet @RednckTruckrHat @richeisen No, he's standing on it. If he's inbounds dribbling and steps on the line like that, he is out of bounds. Therefore, he is out of bounds.

@MLB Thank goodness. WAY too long.
@ben_stana @shipley25 You can reach over if no contact is made. There was clearly contact. And you can't push the inside guy under the rim on a free throw.
@ben_stana @shipley25 He continuously pushed him clear under the basket before they jumped
@Chuckbraud You must've been watching on gametracker on your phone
@NatonGodBasebal Agree, but that doesn't change whether or not it's a foul
@Chuckbraud He pushed him in the back, then went over the back, had him by arm to take the ball away. Can't push the inside guy under the basket on FT.
Wow - that was definitely an over-the-back foul by Meeks. Would've put Oregon on the line...
@SomeonesAnIdiot @Zach_Torres13 Appears as if they April Fooled you. The bullpen is not using a phone if guys are running from the dugout to the bullpen to get loose.

For those asking, the error I'm referring to is NOT the missing nameplate. I realize that's a parallel SP. The error is on the back.

@dcsportsgoat we will just disagree here - personal fouls are the most egregious (dangerous) plays - that's why they are personal fouls
@dcsportsgoat and PI is not a personal foul

@dcsportsgoat anything to deter personal fouls
@judybattista @RapSheet if the @NFL was serious about players' safety, they'd consider these too... https://t.co/4Z5PufIJfu
@southdarden that's only true in 2 sports
@the_mubarak depends on your definition of "pretty well"
@T1D1W1 he signed a contract to allow them to - if he had a problem with it, go play overseas for a year
@the_mubarak and yes, see tweet about the NCAA earlier tonight
@the_mubarak how do you know the kids will see any of it? I know a lot of parents who've done the same thing and kids saw none of it
@CryingJordan sorry @DHuddy41
@BeRock21 he doesn't own them - they're not property
@T1D1W1 you mean those 2 kids that aren't in college? And the other one that got free college?
@BeRock21 he's exploiting his kids, setting unreal expectations for them, and elevating himself to realms of fantasy - it's disgusting
@darrenrovell stop encouraging his nonsense
Hey @NCAA, you can't say academics are priority, then schedule Cincy to play in CA @ 9:40 PM EDT. Get home @ 6 am, then go to class? #absurd
@DHuddy41 at least you made the cut this week #brightside
@DHuddy41 he's a good player and tough as  nails   and you need to stop letting your poor performances in fantasy golf affect your mood
Man, what a performance! This team is special... #RockChalk #sweet16 #marchmadness
This is the first game I've seen all tournament that the refs are going out of their way to make their presence felt.
Rock. Chalk. #marchmadness
This Kentucky/WSU game is insane right now! Great play after great play...
@SportingKC @BMcCarthy32
@RegionRat14 in other words, as long as he's going for the ball and not the hand, he can touch the hand if it's touching the ball https://t.co/OEkbUMVHV4
@RegionRat14 rule 10, Art. 2
@andrewperloff hand is part of the ball - and he travelled anyway
@BigSkindizzle do you still have this?
@adamteicher so why wouldn't they have just signed Poe?
@KenBurns Is your Baseball series ever going to be released on blu-ray? Thanks for your time.
@TerezPaylor nice facemask photo
@darrenrovell aside from the ludicrous-ness of this, wouldn't that eliminate the NCAA eligibility of the younger 2?
@JPosnanski @RealJohnSmoltz or start with 1 out

@CrashGladys nope - didn't wear Adidas
RIP, little guy.  Zuke, thanks for making us all aware... https://t.co/LhnZlI9LW5
@brentandbecca it's a dangerous game always insisting on highest price - if you wait too long, offers will drop...A LOT
@BradThor @bc2499 but you're missing out on a LOT of good stuff if you do...
@Fantasy_Guru KC?
@JeffPassan not a blanket w him, tho - had a Dbacks teammate that he recommended rehab for
Yes yes yes! https://t.co/4NrrQgVUxt
@LaTroyHawkins32 #üò±
Awesome win. Congrats, @KUHoops seniors. You've been incredible to watch. Hope there are 10 more W's left.
Graham and Vick are unconscious right now
Man, AFH is ROCKING! #RockChalk
More awesomeness... this time from @LSUbaseball and their fans:  https://t.co/kmckFg2OHu
@Mrs_McCarthy32 @DHuddy41 @BMcCarthy32 wouldn't be as creepy then
@MikeGrassiSMC90 no, just the last Red Sox pitcher

Fantastic. https://t.co/Sg0XZenraZ
@CJNitkowski and this... https://t.co/564ipoEdk0
@susanslusser @TBrownYahoo after the 6th inning, the crew chief can lateral as many times as he deems necessary
This is awesome.  https://t.co/EzE75tEpDy
@davidkappy nope - just for practice
@DHuddy41 yes https://t.co/u6n6Gwt5uC
@CaseyStern ...that name you dropped back there
@CaseyStern üëáüèªoops...I'll pick it up for you.
@CaseyStern Is that you in the grey hat? Get off the court
Bill Self teams are 18-4 against teams in the top 5 all-time. That's absurd. #RockChalk
@ByJoeDavis So do they already say that? Since it happened before?
@ByJoeDavis That's easy to say now - at the beg of the season, you want a title. Period.
@ByJoeDavis agree, but a ring is a ring
@ByJoeDavis 3 up, 4 to play
@ByJoeDavis one secures a share
@Jeff_Erickson and it's not like they went .500 in non-conference
One. More. Win. #RockChalk https://t.co/y07ur2v2GD
Hey card peeps: any good hobby shops in the Jupiter area?
@FG_Dolan swing on down to Jupiter when the concert's over
@RickMahoney66 Miami
@BluRooster63 nope
Some people I follow on here used to make my timeline enjoyable to browse, but now they've become SO political that it's no longer readable.
Wow. What a win. Headed toward 13 straight... #RockChalk
Down 14 with 2:45 left and forcing overtime?? This. Team. #RockChalk
@ByJoeDavis I don't care if they sign him to an extension - but get him out of the Big XII so his bias won't shine thru
Nothing like an @ESPNCBB analyst rooting for 1 team over another. Not to mention bad logic: 3 dribbles in 2.8 sec leaves no time for a shot https://t.co/1fZnFiDtIf
@LaTroyHawkins32 @BNightengale would be unearned - to make it really fun tho, they should also start the inning with 2 outs and an 0-2 count
@RandyStine lol - he said "I'm not asking for anything extra" but also said "we've never paid for our bags bc of our status [miles]"
@Jeff_Erickson ...to which he should've responded, "It's Mr. Pasch."
@doug987FM @The_SportsPaige and they're definitely not - was just asking
@The_SportsPaige what if the Knicks are your sports team?
Apparently toy companies are now preparing kids for long-term inflation-adjusted gasoline prices... https://t.co/Tj9m8X3GPi
@mattsaltzman do you know who hit the O'Malley?
@NastyBreaks please check dm - thanks
Wow! What an incredible catch by Edelman!

If you haven't read the book "Fearless" by Eric Blehm, please do. Incredible story. https://t.co/KnMUKbqvDH
@SNCSeggie @thedude_snc haha bring it
@thedude_snc can you do it with a Dot?
Kansas, too, @nickcollison4 https://t.co/ALk4ASETE6
Yes!!! 500 for Patty!! https://t.co/9UpZJkGPd5
@Kicky80 @ChecklistsforUS @BreakerCulture and if you hit that big 1/1, it doesn't matter what you paid for the break
@Kicky80 @ChecklistsforUS @BreakerCulture most buyers don't know what pricing should be tho
@Kicky80 @BreakerCulture @ChecklistsforUS easy choice there: don't buy in
@Kicky80 @BreakerCulture @ChecklistsforUS price for a breaker is going to be determined by what they paid
@landy_loo @PatrioticKap that explains why KU didn't foul, but Baylor plays zone all game
@ByJoeDavis they have to have time to cut the highlights
@PatrioticKap a lot of them were on rebounds or fast breaks to stop a layup
What a tough win. This team... #RockChalk
@CryingJordan https://t.co/EixNMkCNL1
@ByJoeDavis beat them Wednesday and it's all moot
@DHuddy41 https://t.co/GcszuTAUpD
@DHuddy41 hey now - that's the MVP of the Pro Bowl #represent
Hey @DHuddy41 - the Redskins won the 15 and under flag football national title - so, there's that...
@ImFasterThanYa will make a big charity donation for those cleats signed!
Not high enough. Sky's the limit... https://t.co/PvfTlHP9Oq

@MikeAndMike @joethomas73 when has a commissioner ever handed the Lombardi Trophy to a quarterback?
@darrenrovell that's cool that he had a stand-in smile at his press conference for him
@JayhawkVideo he's a HS sophomore, right?
@RichLayton42 heard you guys pulled the G Brett barrel - can we see it??
@ByJoeDavis or a Mizzou win - bc they happen with the same frequency

@MLBNetwork @Ken_Rosenthal I hope Trump has a bunch of bobbleheads around his podium today, too
@Britt_Ross108 I hate to say this...but that smell wasn't ST, it was just @Ross_108
@Kyndrasports @JSB_TV the real question is: are they insulated and waterproof?
@FG_Dolan don't need "wow" weeks if he's giving consistent production...#4 overall WR in PPR is good enough for me
@KatiePavlich even if she can't
@ByJoeDavis Conley dropped the ball before he got hit - but it was definitely dirty -as was Steelers players high-5's while Conley on ground
@theis54 @ByJoeDavis yes - by the rules, he certainly can't hit him in the head - gotta figure out another way
@andrewperloff there was 1 holding call in the game tonight - and you can't tell me that was the only time it occurred
Such a disappointing end to a really exciting season. Thanks, @Chiefs - ready for next year already.
That was one of the most entertaining games I've ever seen.  Now, on to more important things... LET'S GO @Chiefs! #ChiefsKingdom
Great catch. But incredible throw.
What. A. Play.
What a game.
Early over/under on Packers vs. Falcons: 107.5
@ryenarussillo Finals is more impressive than Conference Championship - but Brady's run is still incredible
@Lana no - you can always post it...it's never not relevant
One of the best blocks you'll ever see... #NBAVOTE Joel Embiid @JoelEmbiid #RockChalk https://t.co/UeIv7wlyi7
@andrewperloff @dpshow @PaulPabst a simple "no" would've sufficed
@dpshow @PaulPabst @andrewperloff is it a Friday requirement to wear plaid on the front row &amp; quarter-zip pullovers on the back?
@abc7ashley are you not previously familiar with this epic moment in NHL history?
@UKSportsZone ...he says after his team barely beats 8-7 Vanderbilt. #lame
Such typical West Virginia: chant rude things from the student section, then storm the court when your own team was favored to win.
@BoBrack @DMC_Ryan um...my hat was NOT that big on my head
@ByJoeDavis maybe slightly - but WV is a TOUGH place to go
@SiriusXMFantasy @Jeff_Mans Denzel. No explanation needed.
@SportsCollector did you intend to link a 3-year-old article?
@jcrasnick defensive PI - he got tackled
@ChiefsReporter hopefully not in the mold of Vince Young
@Travis_Denning @bour41
@BlowoutBuzz doesn't that resemble 1987 without the wood design?
@Jeff_Erickson you gonna join my dynasty league or what? :)
@EAMaddenNFL dm for screen name
@EAMaddenNFL need to review my last game - opponent had abt 10 sacks on plays that my QB literally didn't have time to release ball #glitch
@DHuddy41 @nikegolf Not really appealing to the average golfer, huh? But if you're absolutely shredded, we have the golf shirt for you!
This is tremendous https://t.co/wCitBIwvzI
@EvynMurray it lets them put you on their spam mailing list (and probably spam lists for all their business partners,too) - resist the urge!
Storming the court: still the dumbest thing in all of college basketball. Schools should be punished SEVERELY if they can't control fans. https://t.co/OcHecXLzRr
@The_SportsPaige @espn eh - he's a free agent - he's probably talking about his future team, not the Bears
AFC West champs. First round bye.   Nothing else needs to be said.  #ChiefsKingdom
@travis_shaw21 @JosephKellyJr NCAA should sanction OSU after that beatdown, starting w prohibition of using "the" before saying school name
@FireHand17 owner selling? I would like to buy
@_TylerWagner_ gonna go ahead and say you should be thanking @tkelce instead
@TrippJc then don't get mad when the other team runs a trick play for a TD
@kinlichiinii may as well bruise their ego so hopefully they bounce back and play well next week out of sheer pride
@DHuddy41 Fair. But way too deep of a thought for this late at night.
@Jeff_Brill nah - they let him walk for a reason - worst-rated RT in the league, according to @PFF
@KingdomChiefs @ByJoeDavis Broncos should look to do the same thing
@Jeff_Brill not to mention Stephenson taking a cheap shot after the fumble
@Jeff_Brill it happened twice tonight!
@ScottJenstad absolutely
Take that, @Broncos - you start playing dirty and keep calling timeouts after the 2-min warning (down 17), we'll run it up on you...no prob.
Chiefs clinch playoff spot! Now time to knock Denver out! #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/uLh3MbLXY2

Oh. My. Goodness. @j_josh11 #RockChalk
Wonder if Elway will be looking at the ref from his luxury suite, asking for help with the crowd noise this weekend... #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/ItnO6nua0W
@CJNitkowski he's definitely not tagging him in that photo - and he's blocking the plate so contact is legal - safe
@K_DILLON20 Pappas, tho. Totally worth it.
@DHuddy41 congrats on Pitt, sorry on Skins https://t.co/PBQl0knbI2
@mattbarnesRHP bet you do
@TheLeisuremen everything on this site https://t.co/Dpcr4aTqrZ
@99_Wolves_17 @bpfox33 I'm saying WC was -22 in Kansas City
@JoeLeatherwood so why are they still calling it when the ball is 10 feet over the WR's head out of bounds?
@99_Wolves_17 @bpfox33 wind chill overnight was -22
@TedNoah1 @MLB @Marlins wind chill overnight was -22
@RapSheet not when the ball is thrown out of bounds
Hey @RapSheet - does defensive pass interference not get waived off still for an uncatchable pass? Officials never consider that anymore.
@priusport https://t.co/7iLpzngFOI
@bpfox33 https://t.co/Y5gfJAaqDM
@fistfullofbills just a huge fan
@gstahl5 @SportingKC would def wear one if I had one!
When you wake up to this, Miami is sounding even sweeter... hello, @Marlins fans! https://t.co/2u9nPyvVu6
@darrenrovell @millatime99 not anymore :)
@mlbtraderumors haha awesome - maybe 2026 tho
@mlbtraderumors haha thank you! Baseball is a game that always compares players to each other, so I prefer comparative adjectives: oldER :)
@mlbtraderumors fair enough -journalistic adjectives should take into account that children keep a player younger than his age says he is :)
@mlbtraderumors I'm not old! Lol
@RapSheet but definitely NOT a middle school offensive coordinator, right?
@jmac___19 @Charcandrick26 PS4 or Xbox?
@DRDutra @Britt_Ross108 @Ross_108 overrated - only the best when holding his hat
@msimonespn I'll take less than 5.
@asben16 SUITS.
@_Mista_J DH could've been centered around ANY holiday tho
@ismebsb haven't seen it either - but I do know that "Fletch" is one of the best basketball movies ever made
@ismebsb so "The Dark Knight Rises" is a football movie then?
@_Mista_J HA is completely centered around Christmas. DH is just at that time of year.
@MikeAndMike No. That's like saying "The Princess Bride" is a baseball movie bc Fred Savage is playing Atari Baseball in the opening scene.
Hey @DHuddy41 - does Duke play at MSG more than the @nyknicks?
@RapSheet she will delete it off her phone after Thursday #ChiefsKingdom
@SiriusXMFantasy @Fantasy_Guru to start year, my team's RB: Gurley, AP, Jamaal Charles, and Matt Jones - needless to say, I had no chance
@SiriusXMFantasy this one is at least a little different - he didn't vulture it - they just pulled their starters
@SiriusXMFantasy the guy I was going against needed to win to get in playoffs - we were the top 2 scoring teams in the league this week https://t.co/QloUZFBK4h
@DHern_30 you'll be jealous of my seats - although, it will be cold! Make sure Carr has a wool glove that fits a messed up pinkie.
@Humesy33 @PlatCardBreaks sent dm
@PlatCardBreaks owner selling?
@The_SportsPaige I may be more part of it now than I was when I was in AZ lol
@The_SportsPaige that's like 15 teams :)

@PaulPabst making a phone call
@CJNitkowski we don't get paid in the off-season...you know this.
Probably my favorite @KUHoops player of all time. #RockChalk https://t.co/JDBurP1veQ
@Ross_108 @HistoryVikings AHHH. I FINALLY understand the haircut.
@ModestoBeek they don't have separate rules (other than one is reviewable) - if the clock hits 0, it's dead This is a delay of game https://t.co/Nh01NZyhKW
@ModestoBeek but end of half is - and when it says 0:00, if Snap hasn't happened, play didn't happen
The Broncos mascot collapsing at the bottom of the goalpost is the best part... #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/jD724Tw4fr
@ModestoBeek incorrect - anytime a replay is used at end of half to see if a play was snapped in time, it's whether 0:00 was showing or not
@ModestoBeek https://t.co/rRSk0f9BUn
@joshrawitch @CrashGladys https://t.co/NeZhCCZwoS
@CrashGladys stay off Twitter on Wednesday night...got it
@darrenrovell how about "Chiefs win because Fowler didn't take a knee"
@CrashGladys and please stop filling my timeline with your RTs of Broncos and Hoosiers stuff üòú
@CrashGladys @Broncos https://t.co/Fz7uR8TYNB
HUGE win! Wow! What an incredible game! #ChiefsKingdom
@ModestoBeek on the TV clock, it was the case
@RedSoxfan_101 tie - keeps us even w Denver
So when the play clock runs out before the game clock hits 2:00, it's NOT a delay of game? #askingforafriend
@andrewperloff he's only got 4-5 drops tonight - I'm all for them giving Hill the ball as much as possible
What a game! #ChiefsKingdom
Put this robe on at home tonight for 1st time. My 2-yo son says, "You have a new Red Sox jersey, Daddy...it's very soft!" Thx @DAVIDprice24! https://t.co/VJMexQIOaH
@SiriusXMFantasy kick them both out of the league and they both forfeit the rest of their games this year - collusion
This is tremendous.  https://t.co/ADclyWk0K6
@FG_Dolan Moncrief was WIDE OPEN on the 4th and goal... never even got a look
@andrewperloff not when every attempt is less than 10 yards
@FG_Dolan @MattBrownCFB off his back foot, no less
@andrewperloff @markese_24 @A_Hudy @JayhawkVideo no no no...I dunked in HS but not like that lol

@msimonespn I'll send it to you after a little research
@msimonespn do you have a pic of the ballot?
@msimonespn yes
@andrewperloff what a cop-out...
@nolimitbill @TheTraeYoung RCJH, TY!
@JRzepecki @TopShelfBreaks should be Braves that's the franchise he played for
Can we vote for him at defensive back AND punter? He's good at both... #letthemcelebrate https://t.co/4fE7oyeDsA

This is spectacular.  @DHuddy41 #RockChalkJayhawk https://t.co/k38iwGccGa
@Billybeeswife I wasn't till I saw the end :)
@SwinCash correction: *THE best
For the record, college basketball refs need to let the players play -these touch foul calls all game long KILL the game. #swallowthewhistle
Watching a little delayed. But...   Rock. Chalk.  What a huge win! Awesome game - Duke is absolutely legit, @DHuddy41 - gonna be a fun year!
Our Christmas lights are going up right after Thanksgiving. Pretty sure we'll be the last decorated house in our neighborhood. #arewelate?
@lisportscards @FireHand17 he should've kept that one
@Ross_108 if you didn't post a picture of it, it didn't happen
@CJNitkowski FB comment: *have
@FireHand17 Where the heck did Louisville Slugger get that signature to burn into the bat? Sandberg's auto isn't even close to that legible
@WhoDat @andrewperloff watch the video that McLovin RT'd from @DeanBlandino
@WhoDat @andrewperloff that's not illegal unless you pull him to the ground
@WhoDat @andrewperloff yes you can - if you get on top of him with open palms
@fincher23 @andrewperloff that's legal if he gets on top of him with open palms
@andrewperloff he could've avoided that one easy... doesn't have to fight for every single yard if he's concerned about his health
@SiriusXMFantasy @rotobuzzguy how is Benjamin even in this discussion? #1, he wasn't a high pick in 2016...and #2, he hasn't been that bad
@andrewperloff I don't understand why, in a crucial situation, teams don't alter the snap count a little
@Jstylep just because your future's so bright, dog...
Can anyone tell me why @NFL officials wear headsets to talk to ea other? They never use them - still always huddle up to discuss penalties.
Take that, AFC West! #ChiefsKingdom
@Espngreeny yep - 5 yards - who cares!? W!
Oh my goodness!!! #ChiefsKingdom
Jameis Winston just had his Heisman moment.
Hey @SNCmusic - congrats on the W last night by your team. Anxious to hear what song I get to use for walkout music for awhile this year...
@CrashGladys now you get 5 more min of anxiousness!
To all those who have served, are serving, &amp; will serve: thank you. Our freedoms are because of you. Forever grateful... #HappyVeteransDay
If @KUHoops wins, then @SNCmusic will shoot a quick video of the group singing the #RockChalk chant in perfect harmony. #RCJH
If @IndianaMBB wins, @SNCmusic gets to pick my walkout song at some point next year, and I'll use it from then until I give up a run.
So the fellas from @SNCmusic and I have a friendly wager on tonight's @KUHoops &amp; @IndianaMBB basketball game...   Stakes in next 2 tweets...
@ScottHarvath @BradThor those are awesome
Zero argument. Congrats, man... https://t.co/YYVovJ3Q41
@ScottJenstad turn the TV to a sports station :)
@ScottJenstad no politics, Scott

@nolimitbill know you've prob already made your decision...hope it's Kansas, but if not, best wishes anyway #RockChalk
@mrtigergator that next-to-last SEC finish that Mizzou was picked for is overrated, too... and the SEC sucks minus UK
Oh man... https://t.co/OHEMMtKoHa
@DeanBlandino The catch rule sucks. It was so much better when it was 2 feet down and control. Way less room for interpretation. Fix it, pls
@FG_Dolan Did he do a football soundtrack? Bc you're not allowed to tweet about non-football things when games are being played
@abc7ashley @ABC7 how is National Candy Day NOT on Nov 1?
@FG_Dolan Dolan for President! It's TIME for a change!
@FG_Dolan and, like every other TB running back this year, was carted off
@brodiebrazilCSN right next to where the pee-testers set up shop
@FG_Dolan could be a trend with Foles in there
@FG_Dolan #RockChalk
Awesome auction going on from now till Friday night to support @DODVaz! Check it out &amp; support an incredible cause: https://t.co/VzXR4SlDTZ
@brentandbecca singles of the hits - the set will be available to buy
@mrdsgrumpy George Washington and Christy Mathewson cut autos
@brentandbecca only 2 cards in the entire set that you could even potentially get your $ back - not worth it - hunt the singles you want
@pgsween @ChiefsReporter wasn't Spencer Ware out of the game?
@FG_Dolan yeah, esp after Ware dominated NO last week
@AdamSchefter gotta be freeing up $, right?
@FG_Dolan they don't run the ball enough - esp against bad defenses - Michael was good early yesterday but finished with only 10 carries
@andrewperloff agreed - sometimes when he runs, he lowers his head - but sometimes they jump at him bc he's so big and it doesn't get called
@andrewperloff He accepts he's going to be hit at times...more than others do. But he gets head shots a lot...shouldn't happen when u r 6-6
@andrewperloff pretty sure he was talking about the low shot at his knees when he was throwing from the pocket
Why didn't the Eagles call timeout there??
@andrewperloff maybe the big plays wouldn't have even happened without the hold occurring...
@AdamSchefter #astroturfsucks
I don't even think NFL refs understand the catch rule. Kelce caught it, took 3 steps, stretched out for pylon after stepping OB &amp; no catch?
@SoldierFieldBlg @The_SportsPaige everyone hates on teams they hear about all the time, no matter why they're heard about
@WatchTheBreaks @Cubs @PatNeshek I'm a free agent - let the bidding for BP throwing begin lol
@SNCSeggie you were right - killed it
@Rotoworld_FB how does "out a few more weeks" and "on track for an early November return" even make sense? Early November is next week.
@The_SportsPaige She was raised in StL. Just scared to admit it in that crowd.
@The_SportsPaige how is that different than the rest of America? You're either a Cubs fan or you root against them.
@RapSheet Tom House is a pitching "guru." Based on his throwing motion, Bortles was learning how to throw long toss with a football.
@JeffPassan thank goodness they moved the game time up a bit
@JMettley @brandonbaker17 but it's still a better measure than which league wins the AS game
@ByJoeDavis but they got what, maybe 1-2 at-bats? Against the best pitchers in the AL?
@brandonbaker17 @JMettley you're leaving out interleague play - those 20 games can make a difference
@JMettley also, ~20 interleague games could drastically affect that
@JMettley just bc they're sub-.500 doesn't mean they're a worse team - top end of one league may be way better; therefore, tougher schedule
@CJNitkowski amazing the game was that fast with the extra length in commercial breaks...
@LaTroyHawkins32 @darenw where's the spin rate statistic for backspin?
@MattMens1 don't disagree a bit - but getting game 1 is huge
@Beerandkringle you're right - momentum had nothing to do at all with the flow of this game
@raider_wayne no - it changed because there was a tie because teams didn't play extra innings
@MattMens1 didn't say that - but it does matter - easier to get momentum when the fans are on your side
@raider_wayne why does it have to have meaning? It's an exhibition of the best players in the game. Is that not enough?
@JaradReganoGuy better than all-star game winner
@randywatt that one at-bat they got.
@raider_wayne best reg season record, alternate years, and about 100 other better options
Tough to overstate how important it is to play in the league that wins the All-Star game. Hope that rule changes someday.
@RoyMunson44 yes - first of all, who cares who the holder and center are? But why mention it on an XP but not a FG? It's comical.
It's hilarious to me that NFL box scores announce who the center and holder are for extra points...but not for field goals... https://t.co/UTEA8v7ToX
@andrewperloff he did get past 100 yards tho - so there's that
@andrewperloff definitely an incompletion - laws of physics say that - but still a pretty impressive throw...he needs to borrow OBJ's gloves
@andrewperloff They have to play that far back to tackle the Broncos RBs, because no one is tackling near the line of scrimmage.
@Baseball_More @darenw no - those weren't on the chart - threw 2 overhand pitches this year
@darenw overhand :)
Re: Saints &amp; late hits... I guess that's what happens when your defense is slow &amp; terrible - you don't get a chance to hit till play is over
Watching gm delayed: appears Saints have their bounty program in effect again: targeting on receiver &amp; 2 late hits on QB, all in same drive
@incisively yes pls
@SteveGilbertMLB @nickpiecoro didn't read the story - did you count the 2 days that Trammel managed?
@andrewperloff no doubt - it's a great offensive system - but backup QB can't run it like BR does
@andrewperloff wow, really going out on a limb with the Big Ben torn meniscus report
@racheleziegler they don't exist - maybe https://t.co/UCyK00NAhh personalization? Thanks for being a fan!
So Auston Matthews appears to be decent at hockey.
No joke: walking toward Fenway &amp; just passed a teenager with a @SanJoseSharks hoodie on. Hockey season is back, baby!
Also, thanks so much to everyone for the bday wishes. Even tho we lost, it was fun to still be playing on my bday. Hasn't happened much...
To the city of Boston and all of @RedSox Nation... https://t.co/4PnJa5GkGz

@BomberBreaks @toppscards @SHOWYOURHITS @sportscards @ChecklistsforUS First cut auto signed by a player's wife?
@andrewperloff more importantly, what did you order off the kids menu?
Best October pitcher of a generation... https://t.co/wEenQoM0io
@ActofValorAward thank you so much!!
@FG_Dolan were they all against the Chiefs?
@brodiebrazilCSN remember that one week in the off-season that Encarnacion was on the A's roster?
@Britt_Ross108 @Ross_108 wrong - try again
@MikeAndMike Peter and Stewey Griffin
@pgsween it looks best when they wear the socks that are mostly red as opposed to red being an accent color
@UCLAFAN333 @LandenLucas33 he does the radio commentary for Jayhawks basketball now
@UCLAFAN333 @LandenLucas33 lol I know - Gurley played in the early '90s
@darrenrovell gotcha - my bad
@darrenrovell on the site, it says final price is $318,500
@darrenrovell pretty sure it's higher than that
@LandenLucas33 @KansanNews Greg Gurley?
@jcrasnick no, she looks annoyed that you moved her from her resting spot
Solid series of awkward high-gives, fist bumps, and handshakes by Team USA right there. But making putts, that's what matters. #RyderCup
@SNCSeggie Mary, Did You Know - incredible a capella song
@CJNitkowski It "sounds" biased? Are you gauging the tone with which I type?
@CJNitkowski Porcello
@aaron_watson what!? Where?
Glad NY fans saw past the rivalry &amp; cheered for David. And props to the @Yankees for a classy ceremony &amp; gifts. Privileged to witness it...
@ESPNDanaOneil Please. Why would KU wanna damage their schedule playing a team that went 3-15 in the sorry SEC last year?
Today was my daughter's first birthday, so we decided to pop some champagne to celebrate. #ThanksPapi https://t.co/vETPMI2qLI
@adamteicher why not put Peters on Wheaton and double team Brown with 2 other guys? Guarantees a mismatch on both sides
This is quality internet video #ThanksPapi https://t.co/TQuuiq3HGv
@KansasHoopstalk do they have any evidence for these predictions? Or just a hunch?
@andrewperloff I have a big problem with shows being in the top 20 of all time that were on for 2 years
@EvynMurray @mollybearr_ agreed...while hilarious, don't let emotions of a fun moment elicit poor judgment
@JeffPassan we better shrink the strike zone though - not enough offense and excitement - and it will speed up the avg game time (????)
@bosox1994 the best of my dance moves = Elaine from Seinfeld... so, no.
@jonmorosi but that's also assuming I'm a capable teacher...
@jonmorosi you're better at writing than I am, though, so I won't compete there
@jonmorosi good thing you're not an advanced scout
@jonmorosi but only one of them can pitch at a time, so just scout that guy
@FG_Dolan How do you abort a Hail Mary attempt? No reason he couldn't have chucked it toward the end zone
My gosh. Just sick in my stomach hearing about Jose Fernandez. Praying for his family, friends, and teammates...
@BradPaisley hang around for some playoff baseball
This is top 5 all-time... üòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/0IuabIMDtC
@alannarizzo probably tasted so sweet
@PeteAbe we knew - bigger goals
@Busch26 no - but only bc the play never happened
@Busch26 not sure if college rule, but NFL rule is if any part of his body is behind the line, it's a legal pass...so would've counted
@iammaliknewman what do you play? #rockchalk
@mookiebetts @RedSox dude - love it - but you're kinda too good at it tho - it comes so natural for you
@RapSheet Favre
@PeteAbe but what did they dump all over the floor?
@nolimitbill get ready for some goosebumps
@LeBatardShow a lot of teams' OFers come together and do something choreographed after the last out of a game - not specific to any opponent
@FG_Dolan no comment
Awesome @YahooFantasy app update tonight. Also, solid trolling... https://t.co/eZ1pYqJOGb

@JeremyAffeldt @AhmedFareedCSN that was before they started teaching common core - now kids aren't sure if Jeremy's right or not
@darenw one of them was overhand haha
@FG_Dolan Dante Hall
We say this every year and almost every week: the @NFL catch rule is a JOKE. That said, glad it helped the #Chiefs this time. üòÇ
@Solarte26 praying for you and your girls, man...so sorry for your loss
@Kyndrasports Enjoy my home! Go SKC!
@3doorsdown come hang out at Fenway this afternoon
@CJNitkowski Lindsey Stirling - she's amazing @LindseyStirling
@FG_Dolan or he just had to look off the defender
@RedSoxfan_101 then you should've expected it
@RustyRoyas I didn't care who won last night, was just happy for Fitz and it was a great game. Chiefs, Sharks, Jayhawks.
@RichLikesSox @RustyRoyas I'm actually a Chiefs fan - but Fitz is a great guy - got to know him a bit in AZ
