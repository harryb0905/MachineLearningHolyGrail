😓 Very sorry to miss the gala tonight. My back spasmed and locked up while warming up backstage. I’m back at the hotel with a great medical staff and lots of ice. Thanks for an incredible week in Anaheim. We’ll see you in Saitama. https://t.co/Z1ZIKb1Ppd

The legacy you’ve left in your county will live forever, as will our memories of you. I’m sending every bit of love I have to Denis, his mother Oksana, and all of his friends and fans around the world. Rest In Peace, Denis.
.@Tenis_Den I can’t believe you’re gone. I remember when you made your handle. We thought Tenis Den was so clever! You overflowed with talent. You were the kindest gentleman. To me you were the next president of Kazakhstan, whose people you made so proud with your achievements.
This weekend I had the honor of speaking to @umich graduates from the department of Org Studies, including @AustinHatch30 whose story of perseverance is second to none. It was an honor to meet you, Austin. Congrats, class of 2018! #GoBlue https://t.co/jglZzTs4SX

As a son, brother, uncle &amp; ally of women I say, happy #InternationalWomensDay. The progress made in the last year is very real, but the fight for gender equality isn’t over. I stand with the women and movements like #TimesUp &amp; #MeToo that have pushed the needle towards equality.
@JoeJohnsonIce haters gonna say it’s fake
