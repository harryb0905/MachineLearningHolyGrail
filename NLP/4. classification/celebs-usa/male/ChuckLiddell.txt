He told his guys on the show he might not fight because of a sore neck week 1. He never planned on fighting me the last time https://t.co/n44HbWlLYE
Agreed, I mean no disrespect to punk he has the heart of a fighter, just not the skill to be fighting in the UFC https://t.co/qPETXIkwkP
How’s it a rubber match? I knocked him out twice ??? He’s 0-2 soon to be 0-3 https://t.co/VRqkm4DAb6
Calm down, if you actually show up once we get the deal done, I’ll be happy to knock you out one more time! https://t.co/xwecMSYgzP
In college we used to call that a Fresno State timeout 😂 @DeWayneZinkin did Romero wrestle for you guys?
That was a horrible fight. I never thought I’d see two 0-1 fighters in the UFC and on the main card to boot. 🙈
